Governance, it found was not<br />\nthe sole, nay, not even the primary, undergraduate<br />\nproblem. One committee could investigate that, but<br />\nanother group, with a special name, the Blue Ribbon<br />\nPanel, should 'study the central Liuestion, the<br />\nundergraduate curriculum.<br />\nThe governance committee, as we all know, bombed,<br />\nand now the same fate seems in store for the BRP. Despite<br />\nthe urgent tone of Woodford Howard when he suggested<br />\nthe panel, the Academic Council now seems content to let<br />\nits report moulder. The BRP compiled its preliminary<br />\nfindings last May, but the AC doesn't even intend to look<br />\nat them at its mid-September meeting. Perhaps such<br />\nactions as this will make it clear why students complain<br />\naround here. The \"widespread dissatisfaction\" which<br />\nHoward and crew found probably would not exist if the<br />\nAcademic Council and other powerful governing bodies<br />\nhad been more responsive to undergraduates. One would<br />\n-think that they would have learned their lesson. But, no,<br />\napparently they've ignored undergraduate education for so<br />\nlong that another month, or year, won't hurt.<br />\nThe AC's delay in acting upon the BRP's findings is<br />\nmerely of an extension of its previous do-nothing attitude<br />\ntowards the problem of undergraduate education. A few<br />\nfreshman seminars do not a new curriculum make, and the<br />\nsooner thcsel 2 senior faculty members learn that, the<br />\nbetter off we will all be.

The company<br />\nmight be willing to spend money to make their dining spot<br />\nmore acceptable to students, some administrators arc<br />\nsaying. If that dubious assertion is true, then this new<br />\ncommittee must be something more than the usual puny<br />\nHomewood debating society. The Administration is most<br />\nlikely having this committee established as a ploy to ward<br />\noff effective action against the cafeteria. The new<br />\ncommittee, with its broad representation from the<br />\nHopkins community, should make strong demands on the<br />\nMacke Company and the University, as well as take the<br />\nlead in a boycott and other protests.<br />\nAs Bates has noted, there are some changes that can be<br />\nimmediately and easily implemented. Fresh-brewed coffee<br />\nand freshly prepared sandwiches, for example, are<br />\nessential. And while the Macke Company, backed by the<br />\nUniversity, stubbornly refuses to expand the hot food line,<br />\nthe committee should not abandon that demand. The new<br />\npanel might also consider giving support to the alternative<br />\nfood services.

Especially<br />\nnotable are a boldly constructed<br />\ntiger, in which the paint is freely<br />\nbrushed onto the paper. and a<br />\npainting of two figures which<br />\nbears a marked resemblance to a<br />\nMatisse sculpture. \"Two<br />\nNegresses,\" in the Museum's<br />\nCone collection.<br />\nThe Museum's Drawing Room<br />\npresents a series of different<br />\ncollections over the c:ourse of a<br />\nyear.

He's<br />\nRobert Oliver, Johns Hopkins'<br />\nnewly appointed soccer coach,<br />\nsucceeding the departed Robert<br />\nKnauff.<br />\nAlthough a newcomer to the<br />\nHomewood community, Oliver<br />\nis by no means a stranger to the<br />\nBaltimore metropolitan area. He<br />\ngenially describes himself as a<br />\nproduct of the Monument City<br />\nand its public school system,<br />\ngraduating from nearby City<br />\nCollege in 1952. After earning a<br />\ndegree in secondary education at<br />\nthe then Towson State Teachers<br />\nCollege in 1956, Oliver remained<br />\nin the area to teach geography<br />\nfor twelve years at his high<br />\nschool alma mater.<br />\nSince 1968 he has been on the<br />\nfaculty of Patapsco High in the<br />\nsouthern part of the city, finding<br />\nenough time in between to earn<br />\nhis master's degree in secondary<br />\neducation from the University of<br />\nMaryland in 1965.<br />\nOliver comes to Hopkins with<br />\nextensive high school coaching<br />\nexperience. At City he served at<br />\nthe helm of both the soccer and<br />\nthe lacrosse teams before a teacher-balancing shift by the<br />\nschool board cost him the posts.<br />\nUndaunted, Oliver continued<br />\nteaching geography during the<br />\nday at one location while, after<br />\nschool, taking his coaching talents to another.<br />\nHe headed the soccer program<br />\n<br />\nat Mount Saint Joseph High and<br />\nthe lacrosse squads of Northern,<br />\nLoyola, and Mt. St. Joseph<br />\nHighs. He notes with pride that<br />\nunder his tutelage the Gales last<br />\nspring captured their first stick<br />\n<br />\natmosphere at Hopkins much to<br />\nhis liking. He freely praised the<br />\nco-operation that he has been<br />\nreceiving from the other<br />\ncoaches, the facilities at his<br />\ndisposal, and the reputation of<br />\n<br />\nRobert Oliver<br />\ntitle in twenty-one years.<br />\nWith such vast experience<br />\nwith school hopping, Oliver<br />\ndoesn't mind in the least the<br />\nconsiderable traveling he must<br />\ndo to get to Homewood for 4:00<br />\npractice every afternoon. To the<br />\ncontrary, he has found the<br />\n<br />\nphoto by greg davis<br />\n<br />\nphoto by greg davis<br />\n<br />\nthe school itself. \"I've always<br />\nhad a lot of respect for this<br />\nschool academically,\" Oliver<br />\nnoted.<br />\nA halfback during his<br />\ncollegiate playing days, the new<br />\ncoach recalled that \"I had some<br />\nof my finest games playing here<br />\n<br />\nat Hopkins.\" In fact, in 1953<br />\n(year of Hopkins' last<br />\nMason-Dixon soccer crown),<br />\nBlue Jay Coach Mickey<br />\nCochrane cast an all-American<br />\nballot for Oliver, largely on the<br />\nstrength of his performance at<br />\nHomewood Field.<br />\nOliver readily admits that his<br />\nplaying experience as a halfback<br />\nhad made him a defensively<br />\noriented coach. \"I work most of<br />\nthe time with the defense and<br />\nspeak to people who are very<br />\nknowledgeable about defensive<br />\nplay. These guys never get<br />\ncredit, but they got to do it.<br />\nYou can have the greatest<br />\nshooters in the world, but if the<br />\ndefense doesn't do the job, you<br />\naren't going to win.\"<br />\nThese students who have tried<br />\nout for the team have impressed<br />\ntheir. leader as \"a very fine<br />\nbunch of young men\" with \"a<br />\nvery fine attitude.\" Although<br />\nOliver would not go so far as to<br />\npredict a specific record or<br />\nconference showing for the<br />\nupcoming season, he did<br />\nmention that he'll \"try to<br />\nimprove on a disastrous (3-6-2)<br />\nyear.<br />\nIn all my years of coaching<br />\nI've never lost, and I don't<br />\nanticipate starting now that the<br />\nyears are getting shorter and<br />\nshorter.\" He plans on stressing<br />\nfundamentals, hustle, and desire.<br />\n\"I have confidence in myself and<br />\nthe people I've coached. We'll<br />\nplay a complete game ,of ninety<br />\nminutes.\"<br />\nPresently a resident of<br />\nDundalk, Oliver is married and<br />\nthe father of five.<br />\n<br />\nof the fraternity houses will be<br />\nengaging in this year's<br />\ncompetition, since several are<br />\nsuffering from a shortage of<br />\nfunds, and other problems.<br />\nSecondly, the upperclass<br />\ndormitories still must decide,<br />\naccording to Colonel Serena,<br />\nwhether to allow freshmen in<br />\nthose houses to compete on the<br />\nsame intramural teams as the<br />\nupperclassmen or on different<br />\nones. As of now, the older<br />\ndormitories have not held their<br />\nmeetings on this subject.<br />\nLast of all, the presence of<br />\n115 girls on campus this year has<br />\ncreated another problem for the<br />\nmembers of the board. For the<br />\n. past two years, the members<br />\nhave been trying to get a female<br />\nrepresentative on the board<br />\nthough the girls have declined.<br />\nThis year, the Colonel is a little<br />\nbit more hopeful that a program<br />\nof female intramural sports can<br />\nbe arranged.<br />\n<br />\nHe still remembers the time<br />\nmat the \"BUNNIES\" played<br />\nWood House in lacrosse, though<br />\nhe realizes that the girls might<br />\nnot be able to compete in the<br />\nsame sports as the boys. The<br />\nColonel plans on starting a<br />\nbadminton program, along with<br />\ntennis, basketball, and co-ed<br />\nvolleyball competition (sorry<br />\nguys, no touch football or<br />\nwrestling).<br />\nHopefully, all these things will<br />\nbe worked out during the<br />\ncoming week. Meanwhile, the<br />\nteams are urged to start getting<br />\norganized, and to start practicing<br />\nfor the coming season.<br />\nOther events held in the fall<br />\ninclude the famed Goucher<br />\nGallop cross country event and .<br />\nsquash and handball<br />\ncompetition.<br />\n(Chauvinism in this artielecourtesy ofsports staff \u2014 Eds.)<br />\n<br />\n\f7<br />\n<br />\ntvis<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nSept.\u202214, 1971. \u2022<br />\n<br />\nRooters Require Work<br />\nBy ANDY FREDMAN<br />\n' The varsity soccer squad is<br />\n\"showing slow progress. and still<br />\nneeds a lot of time and work,\"<br />\nsays the booter coach.

Governance, it found was not<br />\nthe sole, nay, not even the primary, undergraduate<br />\nproblem. One committee could investigate that, but<br />\nanother group, with a special name, the Blue Ribbon<br />\nPanel, should 'study the central Liuestion, the<br />\nundergraduate curriculum.<br />\nThe governance committee, as we all know, bombed,<br />\nand now the same fate seems in store for the BRP. Despite<br />\nthe urgent tone of Woodford Howard when he suggested<br />\nthe panel, the Academic Council now seems content to let<br />\nits report moulder. The BRP compiled its preliminary<br />\nfindings last May, but the AC doesn't even intend to look<br />\nat them at its mid-September meeting. Perhaps such<br />\nactions as this will make it clear why students complain<br />\naround here. The \"widespread dissatisfaction\" which<br />\nHoward and crew found probably would not exist if the<br />\nAcademic Council and other powerful governing bodies<br />\nhad been more responsive to undergraduates. One would<br />\n-think that they would have learned their lesson. But, no,<br />\napparently they've ignored undergraduate education for so<br />\nlong that another month, or year, won't hurt.<br />\nThe AC's delay in acting upon the BRP's findings is<br />\nmerely of an extension of its previous do-nothing attitude<br />\ntowards the problem of undergraduate education. A few<br />\nfreshman seminars do not a new curriculum make, and the<br />\nsooner thcsel 2 senior faculty members learn that, the<br />\nbetter off we will all be. It is possible now to step off of<br />\nthe committee after committee treadmill with some<br />\nsubstantive action on the BRP findings.

The company<br />\nmight be willing to spend money to make their dining spot<br />\nmore acceptable to students, some administrators arc<br />\nsaying. If that dubious assertion is true, then this new<br />\ncommittee must be something more than the usual puny<br />\nHomewood debating society. The Administration is most<br />\nlikely having this committee established as a ploy to ward<br />\noff effective action against the cafeteria. The new<br />\ncommittee, with its broad representation from the<br />\nHopkins community, should make strong demands on the<br />\nMacke Company and the University, as well as take the<br />\nlead in a boycott and other protests.<br />\nAs Bates has noted, there are some changes that can be<br />\nimmediately and easily implemented. Fresh-brewed coffee<br />\nand freshly prepared sandwiches, for example, are<br />\nessential. And while the Macke Company, backed by the<br />\nUniversity, stubbornly refuses to expand the hot food line,<br />\nthe committee should not abandon that demand. The new<br />\npanel might also consider giving support to the alternative<br />\nfood services. The focus of all demands should be on<br />\nmaking the cafeteria a healthy and attractive place to eat.<br />\nThe Administration's entire method of handling the<br />\ncafeteria situation, from its secret decisions last spring to<br />\nits supposed new willingness for campus consultation, is<br />\nadditional proof that students and others cannot expect<br />\nthe Administration to serve their best interests.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLast night we attended the<br />\nfirst meeting of the Johns<br />\nIlopk ins Un iv e rsity Student<br />\nCouncil.

Especially<br />\nnotable are a boldly constructed<br />\ntiger, in which the paint is freely<br />\nbrushed onto the paper. and a<br />\npainting of two figures which<br />\nbears a marked resemblance to a<br />\nMatisse sculpture. \"Two<br />\nNegresses,\" in the Museum's<br />\nCone collection.<br />\nThe Museum's Drawing Room<br />\npresents a series of different<br />\ncollections over the c:ourse of a<br />\nyear.

He's<br />\nRobert Oliver, Johns Hopkins'<br />\nnewly appointed soccer coach,<br />\nsucceeding the departed Robert<br />\nKnauff.<br />\nAlthough a newcomer to the<br />\nHomewood community, Oliver<br />\nis by no means a stranger to the<br />\nBaltimore metropolitan area. He<br />\ngenially describes himself as a<br />\nproduct of the Monument City<br />\nand its public school system,<br />\ngraduating from nearby City<br />\nCollege in 1952. After earning a<br />\ndegree in secondary education at<br />\nthe then Towson State Teachers<br />\nCollege in 1956, Oliver remained<br />\nin the area to teach geography<br />\nfor twelve years at his high<br />\nschool alma mater.<br />\nSince 1968 he has been on the<br />\nfaculty of Patapsco High in the<br />\nsouthern part of the city, finding<br />\nenough time in between to earn<br />\nhis master's degree in secondary<br />\neducation from the University of<br />\nMaryland in 1965.<br />\nOliver comes to Hopkins with<br />\nextensive high school coaching<br />\nexperience. At City he served at<br />\nthe helm of both the soccer and<br />\nthe lacrosse teams before a teacher-balancing shift by the<br />\nschool board cost him the posts.<br />\nUndaunted, Oliver continued<br />\nteaching geography during the<br />\nday at one location while, after<br />\nschool, taking his coaching talents to another.<br />\nHe headed the soccer program<br /><br />\nat Mount Saint Joseph High and<br />\nthe lacrosse squads of Northern,<br />\nLoyola, and Mt. St. Joseph<br />\nHighs. He notes with pride that<br />\nunder his tutelage the Gales last<br />\nspring captured their first stick<br /><br />\natmosphere at Hopkins much to<br />\nhis liking. He freely praised the<br />\nco-operation that he has been<br />\nreceiving from the other<br />\ncoaches, the facilities at his<br />\ndisposal, and the reputation of<br /><br />\nRobert Oliver<br />\ntitle in twenty-one years.<br />\nWith such vast experience<br />\nwith school hopping, Oliver<br />\ndoesn't mind in the least the<br />\nconsiderable traveling he must<br />\ndo to get to Homewood for 4:00<br />\npractice every afternoon. To the<br />\ncontrary, he has found the<br /><br />\nphoto by greg davis<br /><br />\nphoto by greg davis<br /><br />\nthe school itself. \"I've always<br />\nhad a lot of respect for this<br />\nschool academically,\" Oliver<br />\nnoted.<br />\nA halfback during his<br />\ncollegiate playing days, the new<br />\ncoach recalled that \"I had some<br />\nof my finest games playing here<br /><br />\nat Hopkins.\" In fact, in 1953<br />\n(year of Hopkins' last<br />\nMason-Dixon soccer crown),<br />\nBlue Jay Coach Mickey<br />\nCochrane cast an all-American<br />\nballot for Oliver, largely on the<br />\nstrength of his performance at<br />\nHomewood Field.<br />\nOliver readily admits that his<br />\nplaying experience as a halfback<br />\nhad made him a defensively<br />\noriented coach. \"I work most of<br />\nthe time with the defense and<br />\nspeak to people who are very<br />\nknowledgeable about defensive<br />\nplay.

As of now, the older<br />\ndormitories have not held their<br />\nmeetings on this subject.<br />\nLast of all, the presence of<br />\n115 girls on campus this year has<br />\ncreated another problem for the<br />\nmembers of the board. For the<br />\n. past two years, the members<br />\nhave been trying to get a female<br />\nrepresentative on the board<br />\nthough the girls have declined.<br />\nThis year, the Colonel is a little<br />\nbit more hopeful that a program<br />\nof female intramural sports can<br />\nbe arranged.<br /><br />\nHe still remembers the time<br />\nmat the \"BUNNIES\" played<br />\nWood House in lacrosse, though<br />\nhe realizes that the girls might<br />\nnot be able to compete in the<br />\nsame sports as the boys. The<br />\nColonel plans on starting a<br />\nbadminton program, along with<br />\ntennis, basketball, and co-ed<br />\nvolleyball competition (sorry<br />\nguys, no touch football or<br />\nwrestling).<br />\nHopefully, all these things will<br />\nbe worked out during the<br />\ncoming week.
