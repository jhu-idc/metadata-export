While the makers of<br />\nthe movie chose to show us<br />\nBernstein's bicycle wheel<br />\npropped against his desk, they<br />\nopted not to explore in any<br />\ndetail, for example, the<br />\nrelationship between Woodward<br />\nand Bernstein, or what goes on<br />\ninside their heads during the<br />\ninvestigation.

The country<br />\nappears increasingly interested in<br />\nthe \"just the facts\" approach of<br />\nthe fourth estate and less<br />\nfavorably inclined towards the<br />\nFictions that literature offers. The<br />\nbook, like the film, is<br />\ncharacterized by a scrupulous<br />\neffort for detail and<br />\nobjectivity--to wit, the authors<br />\nrefer to themselves strictly in the<br />\nthird person and refuse to inject<br />\nany overt commentary--which,<br />\nbecause of the intrigue of the<br />\nevents, makes for absorbing<br />\nreading, but, ultimately, an<br />\nunsatisfying work. The reader is<br />\nnever quite sure what the<br />\nbook--or the movie--is trying to<br />\nsay; or perhaps like so-called<br />\ngood, objective journalism, it<br />\nisn't trying to say anything.<br />\nIn the struggle to maintain<br />\nobjectivity, director Alan J.<br />\nPakulka and screenwriter William<br />\nGoldman have virtually written<br />\nout the characters of \"Wood<br />\nstein\" (as the two reporters came<br />\nto be known). They are depicted<br />\nsimply as highly-aggressive, not<br />\noverly birght, diligent reporters<br />\nwho will eagerly work themselves<br />\nragged to break their story wide<br />\nopen.<br />\n<br />\nI don't think that the film is a<br />\nsuitable medium for this kind of<br />\n\"objective\" narrative, even in this<br />\ncase where the story is naturally<br />\na gripping one. It does not<br />\nstimulate the imagination beyond<br />\n<br />\nthe sorting out and piecing<br />\ntogether of detail.<br />\nBesides, ample space for news<br />\nand objectivity is allotted in our<br />\nmedia; we need some medium for<br />\nexpressing our fictions.<br />\n<br />\nNo limit to the rock rip-off, sir<br />\n<br />\nHolly Near<br />\nat Shriver<br />\n<br />\nphotos by dante<br />\n<br />\nBy PETER J.

STANLEY<br />\nABSTRACT: Standardized group<br />\naptitude and educational<br />\nachievement tests are splendid<br />\nlocators of high ability among<br />\nintellectually precocious youths.<br />\nThe talent-finding value of such<br />\ntests has been neglected, while<br />\ncritics decry their misuse with<br />\nother groups: A \"natural<br />\nexperiment\" dramatically<br />\nrevealed that score on a difficult<br />\nstandardized mathematicsaptitude test predicted<br />\nachievement in mathematics over<br />\na 2 or 3-year period considerably<br />\nbetter than did the judgment of<br />\nthe student's present<br />\nmathematics teacher. For<br />\ndifferentiating among students in<br />\nthe upper 1% or 2% of their age<br />\ngroup, tests designed for much<br />\nolder groups are essential<br />\nsupplements to grade-level tests<br />\nand judgmental procedures. A<br />\nfew months ago in a prime-time<br />\n\"Myth of the IQ\" program, CBS<br />\ncommentator Dan Rather<br />\nexcoriated IQ tests. He pointed<br />\nout, correctly, that they have<br />\nbeen misused, especially during<br />\nthe 1920's.

Located in the town of<br />\nPutney (original home of the<br />\nQuaking Shakers), the school is<br />\none of countless small liberal arts<br />\ncolleges which dot the nation.<br />\nWindham, though, is about to<br />\nsuccumb to the mounting<br />\npressures which these colleges<br />\nface.<br />\nThe academic year ends next<br />\nweek,. one month ahead of<br />\nschedule. On March 17, President<br />\nHarrison Symmes announced, in<br />\nconjunction with the Board of<br />\nTrustees, that Windham had run<br />\nout of money; only a short-term<br />\nloan allowed the school to<br />\ndouble up its operation rather<br />\nthan face immediate collapse.<br />\nThe demise of a college, however,<br />\ngoes well beyond any educational<br />\ntrends or even hard financial<br />\nmatters.<br />\nIn the early seventies,<br />\nWindham had an enrollment of<br />\nclose to 1,000 students and a<br />\nbudget (under President Eugene<br />\nWinslow) over a quarter of a<br />\nmillion dollars in the black. At<br />\nthe start of the 75-76 year, there<br />\nwere only 540 students and a<br />\n$300,000 deficit. Obviously, a<br />\nbudget whose bulk is carried by<br />\nstudent tuitions will sink with a<br />\ns decline in attendance. The<br />\nquestion of Windham's folding,<br />\nthen, rests on the reasons for the<br />\nsteady drop in enrollment. \"One<br />\nflaw stands out,\" reads a<br />\nproposal for a possible re-opening<br />\nnext fall as \"Windham II\": \"It is<br />\nsimply that some time ago a<br />\ndecision was made to sacrifice<br />\nquality and character to size.\"<br />\nThe blame, from all quarters,<br />\nfalls directly on the President.<br />\nSymmes took office in the fall of<br />\n1973, succeeding Winslow, who<br />\nhad resigned under pressure from<br />\nthe faculty (after he tried to<br />\nabolish tenure). As the college's<br />\nthird president in its twenty<br />\nyears, Symmes, according to<br />\nex-Dean of Students Joe Mandell,<br />\n\"came in with a mandate from<br />\nthe Board of Trustees to change<br />\nour reputation, correct the<br />\n'permissiveness'.\"<br />\nWindharri's image was that of a<br />\nloose, uppr-middle class<br />\nsuburban students drug school.<br />\n<br />\nWendy Curtiss (editor of the<br />\ncollege paper), along with many<br />\nothers, has named the drug<br />\nreputation as the fatal factor,<br />\nsaying that it discouraged high<br />\nschool counselors and potential<br />\nstudents. \"It's killed this place<br />\nabove anything else,\" she stated,<br />\nbut added that \"actually, it's no<br />\nworse than any other school.\"<br />\nThe scale of drug use (or abuse:<br />\nthere was an OD in January) is<br />\ndebatable; in the end, it would<br />\ncertainly attract more people<br />\nthan it would scare away.<br />\nProblems<br />\nWhat Symmes faced was a<br />\nstructural problem. The college<br />\nhad over-expanded in the late<br />\nsixties, adding more buildings<br />\nuntil a total mortgage assessment<br />\nof $10 million was reached. When<br />\nthe crunch came in the last few<br />\nyears, the schools had to be<br />\nprepared to handle it. \"Symmes<br />\nand the Trustees couldn't control<br />\nthe main variables,\" said Mandell,<br />\n\"which were academic choice<br />\nand tuition. So they<br />\nconcentrated on lower-level<br />\nreasons, like student life, the<br />\ndrug image.\"<br />\nSymmes came from a<br />\ndiplomatic, not academic<br />\nbackground; he had served 26<br />\nyears in the State Department<br />\nand Foreign Service. \"When he<br />\ncame, Windham no longer had an<br />\naccessible president,\" said<br />\nEugene Cherney, Student<br />\nTrustee. \"He set an<br />\nanti-community tone: a small<br />\nliberal arts college runs on<br />\ntogetherness, a closeness.\"<br />\nRather than living near campus,<br />\nhe kept a mansion in Brattleboro,<br />\na town 10 miles south of Putney.<br />\nWith his governmental<br />\nbackground, he \"delegated<br />\nbureaucrats to deal with<br />\nstudents, created an aloofness<br />\nand distance,\" according to<br />\nMandell. He doubled the size oi<br />\nthe administration in the midst<br />\nof a shrinking environment.<br />\nOne of the President's earliest<br />\nactions was to fire Mandell,<br />\nostensibly for a failure to keep<br />\nstudents at Windham. This<br />\ncompletely broke off any<br />\nrelationship with the community.<br />\nOne student remarked, \"He lost<br />\nour trust in one week over<br />\nMandell.\" A number of<br />\nadministrative directors resigned,<br />\nand student services almost<br />\ndisappeared. Students held a<br />\n<br />\nconvocation: \"We tried to<br />\ncommunicate, but Symmes just<br />\nturned his back. The president<br />\nhad a chance to listen, change,<br />\nbut instead any mutual respect<br />\ndisappeared.\" \"The man's not up<br />\nfront,\" said Curtiss, \"the<br />\nadministration is not honest.<br />\nStudents feel they deserve a<br />\ngreater voice and be allowed to<br />\nknow.\"<br />\nAfter the March 17 statement,<br />\nstudents tried, and were denied,<br />\naccess to the books and financial<br />\nrecords. Some one finally stole<br />\nthem, and sent a copy to Chase<br />\nManhattan in New York.<br />\nAn alienated president isn't<br />\ngoing to doom a college, no<br />\nmatter how srrull or close-knit the<br />\ncommunity is. Symmes'<br />\ncharacter, mistakes, and fiscal<br />\nincompetence made a terrible<br />\ncombination, but four hundred<br />\nstudents left on their own<br />\ndecisions. With tuition, room and<br />\nboard totalling $4600, many felt it<br />\nhad become too expensive for its<br />\nbenefits. Although the faculty is<br />\nuniversally praised, there was a<br />\ncommon complaint of academic<br />\nconstraint, with liberal arts<br />\nlacking in specialization. The<br />\nWindham II proposal stated,\"We<br />\nwitnessed the development of<br />\nfactionalization based primarily<br />\non department and<br />\ndiscipline...the lack of interaction<br />\nand interchange has rendered<br />\nWindham incapable of satisfying<br />\nstudent and faculty needs.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"the figures and hanks<br />\ntold us to make cuts.<br />\nSymmes didn't want<br />\nto face the facts .<br />\n<br />\nWindham went to open<br />\nadmissions a few years ago, but<br />\nthe freshman class kept<br />\ndecreasing. The increasing<br />\nattrition rate \"was mainly due to<br />\nsmallness and academic matters,\"<br />\nMandell said. \"Students used<br />\nWindham as a stepping-stone, and<br />\nthen it became too costly.\"<br />\nBesides the financial and<br />\nacademic discouragements.<br />\nCurtiss said, \"there is a general<br />\napathy that is appalling. The<br />\nstudent union is dead; there's<br />\n<br />\nnothing to do. The physical plant<br />\nis dreary and living conditions are<br />\nrun down.\" Indeed, the<br />\ninstitution-style complex, with<br />\nidentical white campus buildings<br />\nand dorms, gives one an<br />\noppressed feeling. As for hopes<br />\nthat the students will rally and<br />\nsave .Windham , a student<br />\ngovernment member said,\"When<br />\nthe goddam students have the<br />\npower at their fingertips, they<br />\njust sit back.\"<br />\nRight now any potential<br />\npower lies with the faculty and<br />\nstudents, as the president has<br />\nlong since given up. \"Harry has<br />\nnot the slightest belief in keeping<br />\nthe college open,\" said Cherney.<br />\nMost present administrators have<br />\nno involvement with Windham 11<br />\nplans; Symmes will leave with a<br />\n$30,000 presidential pension.<br />\nWhether he consciously tried to<br />\nclose the college is a moot point.<br />\nWhat did happen, according to<br />\nCherney, is that \"the figures and<br />\nbanks told us to make cuts.<br />\nSymmes didn't want to face the<br />\nfacts, didn't alert the trustees to<br />\nthe situation. We (the trustees)<br />\ndidn't face reality; we listened<br />\nmore to Symmes than to the<br />\nfigures.\"<br />\nThe banks lost faith in the<br />\ncollege to attract and keep<br />\nstudents, and were also<br />\ndispleased with 'Windham's<br />\nwaiting so long to act. A<br />\n$382,000 debt was carried over<br />\nfrom 74-75, making the total<br />\ndeficit about $700,000. In<br />\nJanuary, the Vermont National<br />\nBank turned down a request for a<br />\n$1 million long-term loan, and cut<br />\noff a half-million dollar line of<br />\ncredit. Windham finally received<br />\na $175 thousand short-term loan.<br />\nIn mid-March that amount ran<br />\nout, and another loan saved the<br />\ncollege for a final month. Stanley<br />\nZelinski, a math professor,<br />\ncommented \"the past practice of<br />\nborrowing this month's<br />\nexpenditures based on next<br />\nyear's expectations was a totally<br />\nfoolish policy.\"<br />\nThe faculty unanimously<br />\nvolunteered to work from April 1<br />\nwithout pay (in effect, they will<br />\nonly receive 7/1 2 of their salary,<br />\nsince it is spread monthly, rather<br />\nthan based on the academic<br />\nyear). Meanwhile, Symmes had<br />\nthe professors sign a salary<br />\ndeferment statement, but, when<br />\nrequested, refused to sign it<br />\n<br />\nhimself. The students took over<br />\nmany of the maintenance and<br />\ncafeteria functions, also without<br />\npay.<br />\nProposals for a Windham II<br />\nhave been worked out<br />\nmeticulously; however, a<br />\nconvocation to present them<br />\ndrew less than 200 students. A<br />\npetition to solicit $50 escrow<br />\ndeposits for a possible next year<br />\ndrew only three money<br />\nresponses. \"A lot of students are<br />\nnot going to pledge,\" said an SG<br />\nmember, \"Will it be open? In<br />\nwhat form? We need assurance<br />\nthat come next April Windham<br />\nwon't be in the same situation as<br />\nwe are today. Students don't like<br />\na stall play, don't want the<br />\nmaybes that we've gotten the<br />\npast two years.\" \u2022<br />\nThe<br />\nfinal decision rests with the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, and that<br />\ndepends mainly on community<br />\nresponse. The proposals call for<br />\nroughly the same tuition (and 6<br />\nhours a week volunteer work),<br />\nprojected for 300 students, with<br />\n32 faculty members(there are 54<br />\nat present) at flat $10,000<br />\nsalaries. Windham II institutes a<br />\nlot of basic structural changes<br />\nand reflects an advanced<br />\neducational theory, but the<br />\nfinancial realities would seem to<br />\nnegate any loftly academic<br />\nattractiveness..Charles Corry, SG<br />\nPresident, reflected, \"Just to<br />\nbopen the doors in the fall is what<br />\nyou would call a miracle.\"<br />\nAs the end draws near,<br />\ndespondency and the wish to<br />\nfinally finish with the trauma<br />\nseem to be the general attitude.<br />\nDespite the sincere dedication of<br />\na number of students and<br />\nfaculty, the problems appear<br />\ninsurmountable. Thefts of college<br />\nand personal property, such as<br />\nstereos, scales, and guns, have<br />\nbecome common.<br />\nWith a<br />\nfinancially inept and personally<br />\naloof president, and an<br />\nincreasingly !expensive-decreasingly satisfying program,<br />\nWindham folds next week,<br />\nleaving a lot of distraught and<br />\nstranded people. As Mandell<br />\nstated, \"the people in leadership<br />\ndidn't understand<br />\nWindham...lacked sensitivity to<br />\nshow our identity.\" Windham's<br />\nidentity now is one that similar<br />\ncolleges must soberly realize.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 12/news-letter/april 9, 1976<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Student Council Presents<br />\n<br />\nJAZZ<br />\n<br />\nWeather Report<br />\n<br />\nUNdE111*<br />\n<br />\nSTARS<br />\n<br />\n*-4c* ThE<br />\n<br />\nSATURdAy ApRil 17<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Guest Attraction<br />\n<br />\nJohn McLaughlin<br />\n<br />\nGilmAN QuAd<br />\n5-10 p<br />\n<br />\n*0\"\u2018<br />\n<br />\npEAbody<br />\n<br />\nSunday April 11,1976<br />\n8 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nRAVIME ENSEMME<br />\n<br />\nTickets available at<br />\nall Record Masters<br />\nRecord Tape Collectors<br />\nMusic Liberated<br />\nFreedom Factory<br />\nMusic Machine<br />\nTime Peace Boutiques<br />\nHopkins Union Desk<br />\nand the Bolt.

And then<br />\nStrack stops altogether and sits in<br />\nthe snow. Only his head is visible.<br />\nHe seems pleased with himself<br />\nand asks for a cigarette.<br />\n<br />\np,<br />\n<br />\nMore Behind-the-Sceners<br />\n<br />\nDaetwyler's ears begin to buzz.<br />\nBefore he can think he produces<br />\na Luger from his parka and waves<br />\nit wildly in Strack's direction to<br />\nscare him. The gun accidentally<br />\ndischarges and Strack is killed.<br />\nThe bullet goes through Strack's<br />\nmouth and out the back of the<br />\nhead. There is little blood to be<br />\nseen, even against the field of<br />\nsnow, the bullet has penetrated<br />\nso cleanly. Holtz looks on and<br />\nsays nothing. He knows<br />\nDaetwyler's orders are to shoot<br />\nanyone that resists his command.<br />\nDaetwyler walks on for some<br />\ntime. Holtz is supposed to fall<br />\ninto line and follow. That is the<br />\norder, but Holtz does not follow.<br />\n<br />\nDaetwyler retraces his steps,<br />\nsnorting and fuming hot breath<br />\nlike a horse. He finds Holtz on all<br />\nfours, stabbing the snow and<br />\nfrozen earth with his knife. A<br />\ngrave for Strack? Daetwyler does<br />\nnot wait to find out. He pulls the<br />\nLuger from his parka and shoots<br />\nout with eyes closed. Someone<br />\nshakes him and then speaks.<br />\n\"Wake up, Strack. It's light<br />\nalready.\" The first dream passes<br />\nthrough the second, both the<br />\nproducts of Strack's war-torn<br />\nmind. He reaches for the Luger in<br />\nhis parka by instinct and fingers<br />\nthe cold trigger. Is he awake? The<br />\ngun comes out of his pocket. He<br />\ncannot stop it. He looks at the<br />\n<br />\nloading indicator and sees that<br />\nthe magazine is full. Daetwyler<br />\nand Holtz are huddled close<br />\ntogether, their backs to Strack,<br />\nsharing a cigarette. Strack holds<br />\nthe gun steady with both hands<br />\nand opens fire.<br />\nHe waits to wake with a<br />\ntightening grip in his stomach<br />\nthat forces him to empty his<br />\nbowels. Then he chews the inside<br />\nof his mouth and spits blood as<br />\nhe shouts \"Wake up! Wake up!\"<br />\nuntil the words are foreign.<br />\nWhen the sun goes down<br />\nStrack gathers his blankets about<br />\nhis shoulders and starts for the<br />\nborder. When he needs rest, he<br />\nrests.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\n<br />\nMeet the original other voice.

The country<br />\nappears increasingly interested in<br />\nthe \"just the facts\" approach of<br />\nthe fourth estate and less<br />\nfavorably inclined towards the<br />\nFictions that literature offers. The<br />\nbook, like the film, is<br />\ncharacterized by a scrupulous<br />\neffort for detail and<br />\nobjectivity--to wit, the authors<br />\nrefer to themselves strictly in the<br />\nthird person and refuse to inject<br />\nany overt commentary--which,<br />\nbecause of the intrigue of the<br />\nevents, makes for absorbing<br />\nreading, but, ultimately, an<br />\nunsatisfying work. The reader is<br />\nnever quite sure what the<br />\nbook--or the movie--is trying to<br />\nsay; or perhaps like so-called<br />\ngood, objective journalism, it<br />\nisn't trying to say anything.<br />\nIn the struggle to maintain<br />\nobjectivity, director Alan J.<br />\nPakulka and screenwriter William<br />\nGoldman have virtually written<br />\nout the characters of \"Wood<br />\nstein\" (as the two reporters came<br />\nto be known).

A<br />\nfew months ago in a prime-time<br />\n\"Myth of the IQ\" program, CBS<br />\ncommentator Dan Rather<br />\nexcoriated IQ tests. He pointed<br />\nout, correctly, that they have<br />\nbeen misused, especially during<br />\nthe 1920's. Little was said on the<br />\nprogram, however, about the<br />\ngreat talent-finding value of<br />\nability tests. An event at Johns<br />\nHopkins University illustrates<br />\ndramatically what a .powerful<br /><br />\nvote<br />\nA third student council election is upon us. To many<br />\npeople, this .marks three times too many. Less than half the<br />\nstudent body voted in the last run-off; this one will be lucky<br />\nto draw 500 ballots. Granted, student government elections<br />\nare little better than an old joke, but the trouble, is that all<br />\npolitical contests become viewed in this fashion.

Our most<br />\nprecocious student entered<br />\ncollege in New York City in the<br />\nfall of 1973 as a full-time student<br />\n2 after completing the<br />\n/<br />\nat age 111<br />\n6th grade of a public elementary<br />\nschool. He began with subjects<br />\nsuch as Calculus III, By June of<br />\n4 years old, he had<br />\n/<br />\n1975, at 131<br />\nd<br />\ncomplete four full semesters<br />\nwith As in all courses except for<br />\nBs in French III and one credit of<br />\nbowling.<br />\nPerhaps, if given the same<br />\nopportunity, Gauss, Newton,and<br />\nEinstein would have been even<br />\nmore precocious educationally.<br />\n(Dr. Stanley is the director of the<br />\nStudy of Mathematically<br />\nPrecocious Youth ISMPY1 at<br />\nHopkins)<br /><br />\nWindham sinks into the lush green hills of Vermont<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br />\n\"Nestled in the green hills of<br />\nsouthern Vermont\" begin most<br />\nbrochure descriptions of<br />\nWindham College, accompanied<br />\nby an array of nature-oriented<br />\npictures. Located in the town of<br />\nPutney (original home of the<br />\nQuaking Shakers), the school is<br />\none of countless small liberal arts<br />\ncolleges which dot the nation.<br />\nWindham, though, is about to<br />\nsuccumb to the mounting<br />\npressures which these colleges<br />\nface.<br />\nThe academic year ends next<br />\nweek,. one month ahead of<br />\nschedule. On March 17, President<br />\nHarrison Symmes announced, in<br />\nconjunction with the Board of<br />\nTrustees, that Windham had run<br />\nout of money; only a short-term<br />\nloan allowed the school to<br />\ndouble up its operation rather<br />\nthan face immediate collapse.<br />\nThe demise of a college, however,<br />\ngoes well beyond any educational<br />\ntrends or even hard financial<br />\nmatters.<br />\nIn the early seventies,<br />\nWindham had an enrollment of<br />\nclose to 1,000 students and a<br />\nbudget (under President Eugene<br />\nWinslow) over a quarter of a<br />\nmillion dollars in the black. At<br />\nthe start of the 75-76 year, there<br />\nwere only 540 students and a<br />\n$300,000 deficit. Obviously, a<br />\nbudget whose bulk is carried by<br />\nstudent tuitions will sink with a<br />\ns decline in attendance. The<br />\nquestion of Windham's folding,<br />\nthen, rests on the reasons for the<br />\nsteady drop in enrollment. \"One<br />\nflaw stands out,\" reads a<br />\nproposal for a possible re-opening<br />\nnext fall as \"Windham II\": \"It is<br />\nsimply that some time ago a<br />\ndecision was made to sacrifice<br />\nquality and character to size.\"<br />\nThe blame, from all quarters,<br />\nfalls directly on the President.<br />\nSymmes took office in the fall of<br />\n1973, succeeding Winslow, who<br />\nhad resigned under pressure from<br />\nthe faculty (after he tried to<br />\nabolish tenure). As the college's<br />\nthird president in its twenty<br />\nyears, Symmes, according to<br />\nex-Dean of Students Joe Mandell,<br />\n\"came in with a mandate from<br />\nthe Board of Trustees to change<br />\nour reputation, correct the<br />\n'permissiveness'.\"<br />\nWindharri's image was that of a<br />\nloose, uppr-middle class<br />\nsuburban students drug school.<br /><br />\nWendy Curtiss (editor of the<br />\ncollege paper), along with many<br />\nothers, has named the drug<br />\nreputation as the fatal factor,<br />\nsaying that it discouraged high<br />\nschool counselors and potential<br />\nstudents. \"It's killed this place<br />\nabove anything else,\" she stated,<br />\nbut added that \"actually, it's no<br />\nworse than any other school.\"<br />\nThe scale of drug use (or abuse:<br />\nthere was an OD in January) is<br />\ndebatable; in the end, it would<br />\ncertainly attract more people<br />\nthan it would scare away.<br />\nProblems<br />\nWhat Symmes faced was a<br />\nstructural problem. The college<br />\nhad over-expanded in the late<br />\nsixties, adding more buildings<br />\nuntil a total mortgage assessment<br />\nof $10 million was reached. When<br />\nthe crunch came in the last few<br />\nyears, the schools had to be<br />\nprepared to handle it. \"Symmes<br />\nand the Trustees couldn't control<br />\nthe main variables,\" said Mandell,<br />\n\"which were academic choice<br />\nand tuition. So they<br />\nconcentrated on lower-level<br />\nreasons, like student life, the<br />\ndrug image.\"<br />\nSymmes came from a<br />\ndiplomatic, not academic<br />\nbackground; he had served 26<br />\nyears in the State Department<br />\nand Foreign Service. \"When he<br />\ncame, Windham no longer had an<br />\naccessible president,\" said<br />\nEugene Cherney, Student<br />\nTrustee. \"He set an<br />\nanti-community tone: a small<br />\nliberal arts college runs on<br />\ntogetherness, a closeness.\"<br />\nRather than living near campus,<br />\nhe kept a mansion in Brattleboro,<br />\na town 10 miles south of Putney.<br />\nWith his governmental<br />\nbackground, he \"delegated<br />\nbureaucrats to deal with<br />\nstudents, created an aloofness<br />\nand distance,\" according to<br />\nMandell. He doubled the size oi<br />\nthe administration in the midst<br />\nof a shrinking environment.<br />\nOne of the President's earliest<br />\nactions was to fire Mandell,<br />\nostensibly for a failure to keep<br />\nstudents at Windham. This<br />\ncompletely broke off any<br />\nrelationship with the community.<br />\nOne student remarked, \"He lost<br />\nour trust in one week over<br />\nMandell.\" A number of<br />\nadministrative directors resigned,<br />\nand student services almost<br />\ndisappeared. Students held a<br /><br />\nconvocation: \"We tried to<br />\ncommunicate, but Symmes just<br />\nturned his back. The president<br />\nhad a chance to listen, change,<br />\nbut instead any mutual respect<br />\ndisappeared.\" \"The man's not up<br />\nfront,\" said Curtiss, \"the<br />\nadministration is not honest.<br />\nStudents feel they deserve a<br />\ngreater voice and be allowed to<br />\nknow.\"<br />\nAfter the March 17 statement,<br />\nstudents tried, and were denied,<br />\naccess to the books and financial<br />\nrecords. Some one finally stole<br />\nthem, and sent a copy to Chase<br />\nManhattan in New York.<br />\nAn alienated president isn't<br />\ngoing to doom a college, no<br />\nmatter how srrull or close-knit the<br />\ncommunity is. Symmes'<br />\ncharacter, mistakes, and fiscal<br />\nincompetence made a terrible<br />\ncombination, but four hundred<br />\nstudents left on their own<br />\ndecisions. With tuition, room and<br />\nboard totalling $4600, many felt it<br />\nhad become too expensive for its<br />\nbenefits. Although the faculty is<br />\nuniversally praised, there was a<br />\ncommon complaint of academic<br />\nconstraint, with liberal arts<br />\nlacking in specialization. The<br />\nWindham II proposal stated,\"We<br />\nwitnessed the development of<br />\nfactionalization based primarily<br />\non department and<br />\ndiscipline...the lack of interaction<br />\nand interchange has rendered<br />\nWindham incapable of satisfying<br />\nstudent and faculty needs.\"<br /><br />\n\"the figures and hanks<br />\ntold us to make cuts.<br />\nSymmes didn't want<br />\nto face the facts .<br /><br />\nWindham went to open<br />\nadmissions a few years ago, but<br />\nthe freshman class kept<br />\ndecreasing. The increasing<br />\nattrition rate \"was mainly due to<br />\nsmallness and academic matters,\"<br />\nMandell said. \"Students used<br />\nWindham as a stepping-stone, and<br />\nthen it became too costly.\"<br />\nBesides the financial and<br />\nacademic discouragements.<br />\nCurtiss said, \"there is a general<br />\napathy that is appalling. The<br />\nstudent union is dead; there's<br /><br />\nnothing to do. The physical plant<br />\nis dreary and living conditions are<br />\nrun down.\" Indeed, the<br />\ninstitution-style complex, with<br />\nidentical white campus buildings<br />\nand dorms, gives one an<br />\noppressed feeling. As for hopes<br />\nthat the students will rally and<br />\nsave .Windham , a student<br />\ngovernment member said,\"When<br />\nthe goddam students have the<br />\npower at their fingertips, they<br />\njust sit back.\"<br />\nRight now any potential<br />\npower lies with the faculty and<br />\nstudents, as the president has<br />\nlong since given up. \"Harry has<br />\nnot the slightest belief in keeping<br />\nthe college open,\" said Cherney.<br />\nMost present administrators have<br />\nno involvement with Windham 11<br />\nplans; Symmes will leave with a<br />\n$30,000 presidential pension.<br />\nWhether he consciously tried to<br />\nclose the college is a moot point.<br />\nWhat did happen, according to<br />\nCherney, is that \"the figures and<br />\nbanks told us to make cuts.<br />\nSymmes didn't want to face the<br />\nfacts, didn't alert the trustees to<br />\nthe situation. We (the trustees)<br />\ndidn't face reality; we listened<br />\nmore to Symmes than to the<br />\nfigures.\"<br />\nThe banks lost faith in the<br />\ncollege to attract and keep<br />\nstudents, and were also<br />\ndispleased with 'Windham's<br />\nwaiting so long to act. A<br />\n$382,000 debt was carried over<br />\nfrom 74-75, making the total<br />\ndeficit about $700,000. In<br />\nJanuary, the Vermont National<br />\nBank turned down a request for a<br />\n$1 million long-term loan, and cut<br />\noff a half-million dollar line of<br />\ncredit. Windham finally received<br />\na $175 thousand short-term loan.<br />\nIn mid-March that amount ran<br />\nout, and another loan saved the<br />\ncollege for a final month. Stanley<br />\nZelinski, a math professor,<br />\ncommented \"the past practice of<br />\nborrowing this month's<br />\nexpenditures based on next<br />\nyear's expectations was a totally<br />\nfoolish policy.\"<br />\nThe faculty unanimously<br />\nvolunteered to work from April 1<br />\nwithout pay (in effect, they will<br />\nonly receive 7/1 2 of their salary,<br />\nsince it is spread monthly, rather<br />\nthan based on the academic<br />\nyear). Meanwhile, Symmes had<br />\nthe professors sign a salary<br />\ndeferment statement, but, when<br />\nrequested, refused to sign it<br /><br />\nhimself. The students took over<br />\nmany of the maintenance and<br />\ncafeteria functions, also without<br />\npay.<br />\nProposals for a Windham II<br />\nhave been worked out<br />\nmeticulously; however, a<br />\nconvocation to present them<br />\ndrew less than 200 students. A<br />\npetition to solicit $50 escrow<br />\ndeposits for a possible next year<br />\ndrew only three money<br />\nresponses. \"A lot of students are<br />\nnot going to pledge,\" said an SG<br />\nmember, \"Will it be open? In<br />\nwhat form? We need assurance<br />\nthat come next April Windham<br />\nwon't be in the same situation as<br />\nwe are today. Students don't like<br />\na stall play, don't want the<br />\nmaybes that we've gotten the<br />\npast two years.\" \u2022<br />\nThe<br />\nfinal decision rests with the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, and that<br />\ndepends mainly on community<br />\nresponse. The proposals call for<br />\nroughly the same tuition (and 6<br />\nhours a week volunteer work),<br />\nprojected for 300 students, with<br />\n32 faculty members(there are 54<br />\nat present) at flat $10,000<br />\nsalaries. Windham II institutes a<br />\nlot of basic structural changes<br />\nand reflects an advanced<br />\neducational theory, but the<br />\nfinancial realities would seem to<br />\nnegate any loftly academic<br />\nattractiveness..Charles Corry, SG<br />\nPresident, reflected, \"Just to<br />\nbopen the doors in the fall is what<br />\nyou would call a miracle.\"<br />\nAs the end draws near,<br />\ndespondency and the wish to<br />\nfinally finish with the trauma<br />\nseem to be the general attitude.<br />\nDespite the sincere dedication of<br />\na number of students and<br />\nfaculty, the problems appear<br />\ninsurmountable. Thefts of college<br />\nand personal property, such as<br />\nstereos, scales, and guns, have<br />\nbecome common.<br />\nWith a<br />\nfinancially inept and personally<br />\naloof president, and an<br />\nincreasingly !expensive-decreasingly satisfying program,<br />\nWindham folds next week,<br />\nleaving a lot of distraught and<br />\nstranded people. As Mandell<br />\nstated, \"the people in leadership<br />\ndidn't understand<br />\nWindham...lacked sensitivity to<br />\nshow our identity.\" Windham's<br />\nidentity now is one that similar<br />\ncolleges must soberly realize.<br /><br />\npage 12/news-letter/april 9, 1976<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Student Council Presents<br /><br />\nJAZZ<br /><br />\nWeather Report<br /><br />\nUNdE111*<br /><br />\nSTARS<br /><br />\n*-4c* ThE<br /><br />\nSATURdAy ApRil 17<br /><br />\nSpecial Guest Attraction<br /><br />\nJohn McLaughlin<br /><br />\nGilmAN QuAd<br />\n5-10 p<br /><br />\n*0\"\u2018<br /><br />\npEAbody<br /><br />\nSunday April 11,1976<br />\n8 p.m.<br /><br />\nRAVIME ENSEMME<br /><br />\nTickets available at<br />\nall Record Masters<br />\nRecord Tape Collectors<br />\nMusic Liberated<br />\nFreedom Factory<br />\nMusic Machine<br />\nTime Peace Boutiques<br />\nHopkins Union Desk<br />\nand the Bolt.

Daetwyler<br />\ndeems it critical to continue<br />\nand gives the signal to do so.<br />\nThey are in occupied territory<br />\nand dread each step. But there is<br />\nsomething else, something :z<br />\nDaetwyler keeps to himself.<br />\nStrack's cry for rest dragged into<br />\nhis mind the fragment of a \u2014<br />\nsweaty dream. It is this more<br />\nthan the fear of being captured<br />\nby an unseen enemy that<br />\nconvinces Daetwyler to continue,<br />\nas if by moving he can somehow<br />\ndodge the dream.<br />\nBut Strack falters. And then<br />\nStrack stops altogether and sits in<br />\nthe snow. Only his head is visible.<br />\nHe seems pleased with himself<br />\nand asks for a cigarette.<br /><br />\np,<br /><br />\nMore Behind-the-Sceners<br /><br />\nDaetwyler's ears begin to buzz.<br />\nBefore he can think he produces<br />\na Luger from his parka and waves<br />\nit wildly in Strack's direction to<br />\nscare him. The gun accidentally<br />\ndischarges and Strack is killed.<br />\nThe bullet goes through Strack's<br />\nmouth and out the back of the<br />\nhead. There is little blood to be<br />\nseen, even against the field of<br />\nsnow, the bullet has penetrated<br />\nso cleanly. Holtz looks on and<br />\nsays nothing. He knows<br />\nDaetwyler's orders are to shoot<br />\nanyone that resists his command.<br />\nDaetwyler walks on for some<br />\ntime. Holtz is supposed to fall<br />\ninto line and follow. That is the<br />\norder, but Holtz does not follow.<br /><br />\nDaetwyler retraces his steps,<br />\nsnorting and fuming hot breath<br />\nlike a horse. He finds Holtz on all<br />\nfours, stabbing the snow and<br />\nfrozen earth with his knife. A<br />\ngrave for Strack? Daetwyler does<br />\nnot wait to find out. He pulls the<br />\nLuger from his parka and shoots<br />\nout with eyes closed. Someone<br />\nshakes him and then speaks.<br />\n\"Wake up, Strack. It's light<br />\nalready.\" The first dream passes<br />\nthrough the second, both the<br />\nproducts of Strack's war-torn<br />\nmind. He reaches for the Luger in<br />\nhis parka by instinct and fingers<br />\nthe cold trigger. Is he awake? The<br />\ngun comes out of his pocket. He<br />\ncannot stop it. He looks at the<br /><br />\nloading indicator and sees that<br />\nthe magazine is full. Daetwyler<br />\nand Holtz are huddled close<br />\ntogether, their backs to Strack,<br />\nsharing a cigarette. Strack holds<br />\nthe gun steady with both hands<br />\nand opens fire.<br />\nHe waits to wake with a<br />\ntightening grip in his stomach<br />\nthat forces him to empty his<br />\nbowels. Then he chews the inside<br />\nof his mouth and spits blood as<br />\nhe shouts \"Wake up! Wake up!\"<br />\nuntil the words are foreign.<br />\nWhen the sun goes down<br />\nStrack gathers his blankets about<br />\nhis shoulders and starts for the<br />\nborder. When he needs rest, he<br />\nrests.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br /><br />\nMeet the original other voice.
