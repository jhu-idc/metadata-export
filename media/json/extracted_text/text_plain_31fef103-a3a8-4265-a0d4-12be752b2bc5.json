Since I have<br />\nbeen president of the University,<br />\nthe economic projections and the<br />\noutlooks for federal funds have<br />\nnever been so uncertain.\"<br />\n\"We arrived at that particular<br />\namount through a blend of<br />\nJudgement, need, and<br />\nmathematics, always keeping a<br />\nfeeling for what we thought the<br />\nparents and students would<br />\ntolerate,\" Muller continued.<br />\n<br />\nEllery Woodworth, Special<br />\nAssistant to the President, also<br />\nnoted the economic necessity for<br />\nraising the tuition.<br />\n\"The reasons for the increase<br />\nshould be obvious to everyone<br />\nwhen you consider the 12<br />\npercent per year inflationary<br />\nspiral that we must keep pace<br />\nwith.\"<br />\nThe measure which only<br />\nawaits the \"rubber stamp\"<br />\napproval of the Board of Trustees<br />\nat their October. 14th meeting<br />\namounts to a 10 percent increase<br />\nover the present $3000 tuition<br />\nrate, which went into effect two<br />\nyears ago.

The Stink: This time we let 'em get away with it<br />\n<br />\n/xxix. no. 5Ifriday, septetnber 20, 19741baltimore, maryland179th year<br />\n<br />\ngoing up<br />\n<br />\nBy KEN SOKOLOW<br />\n<br />\nThe recently announced tuition rise came as no shock to<br />\nanyone. With inflation rising at a 14 per cent clip this year, a<br />\n10 per cent increase in tuition could be termed modest. Still,<br />\nthe $300 jump is a tough pill to swallow, since families,just<br />\nlike the University, must deal with the higher cost of living in<br />\nevery other aspect of life.<br />\nWhat strikes us most about the hike is the futility that<br />\npeople concerned must feel in response to it. Because of the<br />\ninflation, the University must up the tuition in order to<br />\nbalance its budget. But because of the inflation students<br />\ncannot afford the increase. Like the inflationary spiral itself,<br />\nthere seems to be no way out of the dilemma. \u2022<br />\nAll that students can hope for is that donors to the<br />\nUniversity will continue to contribute to Hopkins as they<br />\nhave in the past, and that University administrators will see<br />\nthat as much money as possible is given towards keeping the<br />\ntuition down.<br />\n,The only real source of aid that can help alleviate the<br />\nproblem must come, like most solutions to current<br />\ncatastrophes, from the federal government. Only with<br />\nworkable and enduring solutions to the problems of<br />\n-inflation\u2014if they do exist at all\u2014can the battle of colleges for<br />\nlife be won. In the meanwhile, we hope that the government<br />\nwill consider the needs of those attending college, and render<br />\naid through work-study programs, scholarships, tax-breaks,<br />\nand the like, so that higher education will remain open to<br />\neveryone, not just the wealthy.<br />\n<br />\nmost honorable<br />\nThe Honor Commission is charged with the responsibility<br />\nof preventing violations of the University's Honor Code and<br />\nstanding in judgement of such violations as they arise.<br />\nThough there is inherent fallacy in \"enforcing\" an honor<br />\nsystem, we feel that the Commission plays a vital role by<br />\nproviding a source of justice that is uniform and as equitable<br />\nas is possible.<br />\nThe Honor Commission, however, has exceeded those<br />\nlimits within which it functions most effectively, if the<br />\npanel's recent bylaw is any indication. There is no trust when<br />\nprofessors are instructed by the Honor Commission to bring a<br />\nset of blue books to each exam in order to thwart those who<br />\nwould write answers in their own blue books in advance.<br />\nThere is no honor when the Honor Commission tacks up a<br />\nsign in the computer room warning,that \"breaking into other<br />\nstut\u2018ex\u2018xs' cAes\\s<br />\n<br />\nv'keXavoax wry:\\.74\"a<br />\ndO we<br />\n<br />\ntteatea as<br />\n<br />\ncharge to promote, not demean through distrust, the concept<br />\n<br />\nof honor upon which the University's Honor Code is based.<br />\n<br />\nI.

Who's going to<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt's really tough for old<br />\nreactionary rightwingers like<br />\nmyself to swallow the dramatic<br />\noutpouring of wrath from the<br />\nleft-liberal axis concerning the<br />\npardon of Richard Nixon. This,<br />\nremember, is the same crowd<br />\nwhich gave us such obscenities as<br />\nthe antiwar movement-, situational<br />\nethics, the drug \"culture\", selective<br />\nlawbreaking, the Democratic convention of 1972, abortion, racial<br />\nquotas, and detente with the<br />\nCommunist system. Recall if you<br />\nwill that the heroes of this bunch<br />\nare such hopeless clowns as<br />\nMcGovern and Fulbright and<br />\nKunstler and Fonda, such moral<br />\nciphers as Mao and Ellsberg and<br />\nCleaver and the Berrigans, and such<br />\nridiculous inanities as Ramsey<br />\nClark and Timothy Leary and<br />\nKingman Brewster and the New<br />\nYork Review of Books. For the<br />\nliberal-left unable to induct Tricky<br />\nDicky into its pantheon of<br />\nglorified fools, liars, thieves,<br />\n.hypocrites, traitors, junkies and<br />\nmurderers is quite an affront<br />\nindeed, ascribable only to blind<br />\nideological hatred and - yes!! - rank<br />\ndiscrimination. Why should a mere<br />\nobstructor of justice be denied his<br />\nequal right to the adulation and<br />\nhero-worship accorded more<br />\nhardened and experienced<br />\ncriminals? Is a conservative (oops,<br />\npseudo -conservative) crook<br />\ngenetically inferior to the liberal<br />\ncrook?

(EXEUNT, CU$TA1N,<br />\nAPPLAUSE).<br />\nDick Oles '68<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn Mark C. Miller's article on<br />\n<br />\nCesar Chavez's speech, in the<br />\nSeptember 17 Newsletter he wrote<br />\nthat, \"you can make an important<br />\npolitical gesture by simple refusing<br />\nto buy or consume table grapes,<br />\niceberg lettuce, and Gallo and<br />\nother such inferior wines. . .\" This<br />\nis his program for alleviating<br />\nHopkins' political apathy.<br />\nHis advice promotes another<br />\nkind of apathy. He seems to say<br />\nthat by pefsonal adherence to this<br />\nboycott we will all be in the<br />\nvanguard of the struggle for human<br />\nrights. His concluding words are<br />\n\"Join the movement! Fight back<br />\ntoday!\"<br />\nIn his revolutionary enthusiasm<br />\nhe has forgotten to mention, the<br />\nlargest consumer of boycotted<br />\ngoods in the Hopkins community:<br />\nThe Saga Food Service. The<br />\nNewsletter's front page article on<br />\nCesar Chavez's speech also<br />\nneglected to report Mr. Chavez's<br />\nstatement that 'the students at<br />\nHopkins should demand that<br />\nboycotted goods not be bought by<br />\nthe food service. I do not know the<br />\nreason for this double omission;<br />\nthis was one of the most important<br />\nand well received parts of the<br />\nspeech.<br />\nSaga foods is an enthusiastic<br />\nconsumer of lettuce, and table<br />\ngrapes when they are in season.<br />\nThe Newsletter advocates that the<br />\nclients of Saga should simply pass<br />\nby the salad and the grapes. We say<br />\nthat these student should demand<br />\nthat Tom Tanglos, the Saga<br />\nmanager, stop buying boycotted<br />\ngoods.<br />\nGoing beyond individual<br />\nrequests that he stop buying scab<br />\nlettuce, petitions should be<br />\ncirculated and given to Tom<br />\nTanglos. If this brings no result<br />\nmore drastic tactics could be<br />\nemployed.<br />\nAll of this would mainly be the<br />\ntask of the Freshman class. It<br />\ncould have the by-product of<br />\nbreaking the tradition of apathy<br />\nthat has come down from previous<br />\nHopkins classes<br />\nJames Harvey and Colin McGrath<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHaving read Randy Chinnock's<br />\nrecent article about the musical<br />\nactivities at Hopkins, I was<br />\ndisappointed to note that no<br />\nmention was made of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Glee Club. Not<br />\nonly is the Glee Club the oldest<br />\nactivity at Hopkins (founded in<br />\n1883), but it is also very much a<br />\npart of the musical environment,<br />\nperforming a wide variety of sacred<br />\nand secular choral music,<br />\nfrequently with orchestra. Eight<br />\nconcerts are planned in Baltimore<br />\nfor this year, alone, featuring such<br />\nselections as Bach's Magnificat,<br />\nBruckner's Te Deum, Stravinsky's<br />\nSymphony of Psalms, and Vaughn<br />\nWilliams' Dona Nobis Pacem. I<br />\ntrust that this omission was only<br />\nan oversight on the part of the<br />\nauthor, and I expect to see him at<br />\nall of our concerts.<br />\nRalph F.

Without talent a team<br />\ncan't go anywhere; they can't do<br />\nthe impossible. But just sheer<br />\ntalent itself, is likewise no<br />\nguarantee of success. Many teams<br />\nhave been made up of very<br />\ntalented athletes but never<br />\nseemed to emerge victorious. One<br />\nof the other important<br />\ningredients needed for victory is<br />\nleadership. The coaches and<br />\ncaptains of a team play an<br />\nimportant role in how that team<br />\nwill make out during the season.<br />\nThe Hopkins football team has<br />\nbeen fortunate in the past to<br />\n<br />\nTraining room open<br />\nto every student<br />\nby ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nHow many of you readers out<br />\nthere haven't stepped into a<br />\ngymnasium or onto an athletic<br />\nfield in at least a year? And how<br />\nmany of you (if you already<br />\nmeet the above criterion) used to<br />\nbe Mr. (or Ms.) Varsity Athletic<br />\nWonderperson of your high<br />\nschool? And finally, how many<br />\nof you guilty souls have tried to<br />\nrepent for that loss of athletic<br />\nprowess(or lack of it)?<br />\nThere are probably quite a few<br />\nstill left in the ballgame. Thh<br />\ninformation is for you whc<br />\nhappen to occasionally get the<br />\nurge to tear loose from your<br />\nstudies and trek off to the gym<br />\nfor some exercise or just plain<br />\nfun. Take it easy at first. Don't<br />\nthink you could run down to the<br />\nLax office and pick up a stick<br />\nbecause chances are you'll never<br />\nhave opportunity to prove<br />\nyourself. The reason: injury.<br />\nInjuries account for all you<br />\nhome team woes. What are the<br />\nJets without Joe-Willy, the<br />\nKnicks without Reed, the Tokyo<br />\nSuki-akis without Joe Pepitone??<br />\nBut these professional athletes<br />\nhave professional trainers to treat<br />\ntheir tender expensive injuries<br />\n.which enable them to continue<br />\nplaying. Not only do these<br />\ntrainers treat major injuries, they<br />\nalso specialize in the treatment of<br />\nminor injuries such as muscle<br />\nstrains and smashed shins and<br />\nknees, which can also plaque<br />\nprofessional sports teams without<br />\nproper care being administered.<br />\nSo what's the point of all the<br />\nabove? When all of you make<br />\nthat infrequent trip to the gym,<br />\nthat little pain you felt in your<br />\nankle after coming down with a<br />\nrebound during a hot basketball<br />\ngame may cause you .serious<br />\nproblems if the injury is not<br />\ntreated properly or even not<br />\ntreated at all. But don't fret. You<br />\ncan get as good a treatment as<br />\nany million dollar athlete, right<br />\nhere oi the Homewood campus.<br />\nAll you need to do is hobble to<br />\nthe main floor of the Newton H.<br />\nWhite gym, search for the<br />\ntraining room and point out<br />\nwhere it hurts to head athletic<br />\ntrainer, LeRoy Brandimore.<br />\nThe training room was<br />\n.instrumental in keeping our<br />\nNCAA lax champions healthy<br />\nthroughout the year and on the<br />\n<br />\nroad to Rutgers. The same<br />\nfacilities are available to members<br />\nof the Hopkins community.<br />\nBrandy won't turn away anyone.<br />\nHe'll treat anything from football<br />\nto chess injuries. The training<br />\nroom has better facilities than<br />\nthe infirmary and is exleusively<br />\ndesigned to handle athletic<br />\ninjuries.<br />\nFacilities include whirlpools,<br />\nhydrocollaters, muscle<br />\nstimulating machines with<br />\nultra-sound and diathermy<br />\ntreatments. The hours the<br />\ntraining room is available range<br />\nfrom about 1 to 3 and from $:30<br />\nto 7. The intervening hours are<br />\nreserved exclusively for Varsity<br />\nand Junior Varsity teams.<br />\nIf Brandy can't help you, there<br />\nis a competent staff of student<br />\ntrainers who can tape up just<br />\nabout any part of the anatomy<br />\nyou .may be inclined to injure.<br />\nThe student trainers include Dave<br />\nSill, a 3 year 'veteran currently<br />\ntravelling with the football team;<br />\nKelly Morron, the only female on<br />\nthe staff who has 2 years<br />\nexperience, and travels with the<br />\ntrack and cross country teams,<br />\nand Steve Lazzaro, member of<br />\nthe Varsity Wrestling team who is<br />\nstarting his second year in the<br />\ntraining room while attending to<br />\nthe needs of the soccer team.<br />\nThere is an opening available in<br />\nthe training for a freshman,<br />\npreferably one with some<br />\nexperience. Contact Brandy for<br />\nmore details.<br />\nSo remember. No matter how<br />\ngraceful you think you may be in<br />\na competitive sprot, you can<br />\nincur an athletic injury. Failure<br />\nto take care of such an injury<br />\ncould lead to further, more<br />\nserious problems. The help you<br />\nneed is in the training room. It's<br />\nset up for all Hopkins users of<br />\ntheir own bodies. So Use It.<br />\nAlso, this last note is directed<br />\nto any concerned university<br />\nofficial interested in keeping the<br />\nquality of our training room<br />\nintact so they can continue to<br />\nkeep Hopkins sports enthusiasts<br />\nhappy by keeping our Jays on<br />\nthe field, no matter what the<br />\nsport. If there's any of that 100<br />\nmillion left, how about an ice<br />\nmachine and even possibly<br />\nkicking in for an air-conditioner<br />\nfor the training room?

Last<br />\nyear's co-captians Jack Thomas<br />\nand Gunter Glocker are an<br />\nexample of the high caliber<br />\npeople who have filled this<br />\nposition. This year's co-captians<br />\nare no exceptions. Defensive end<br />\nBruce Parker and defensive back<br />\nRick Kramer are the elected<br />\nseniors who will lead the 1974<br />\nBlue Jay gridders.<br />\nBoth Parker and Kramer hail<br />\nfrom Long Island. Bruce is from<br />\nFarmingdale and Rick is from<br />\nPlainview. Another common<br />\nquality is the athletic versatility<br />\nwhich both men have. Kramer is<br />\na reserve quarterback as well as<br />\nstarting defensive back and he<br />\nplays lacrosse in the spring while<br />\nParker played lacrosse his first<br />\ntwo years at Hopkins while<br />\nplaying both offensive and<br />\ndefensive line on the gridiron in<br />\nthe fall.<br />\nWhen asked about their main<br />\nfunctions while serving as<br />\nco-captains, both players had<br />\nvery definite ideas about their<br />\njob. \"We are responsible for<br />\nproviding leadership for the<br />\nteam\", said Kramer, \"and if<br />\n<br />\nnecessary putting the team ahead<br />\nof the individual.\"<br />\n\"We try to set an example for<br />\nthe other players to follow.<br />\nSometimes you don't feel like<br />\ngoing out to practice but you<br />\nforce yourself and work that<br />\nmuch harder in the hope that<br />\neveryone else will follow suit.\"<br />\nParker continued \"There were<br />\nsome really top-notch guys who<br />\nheld these positions before us<br />\nand helped us by setting a good<br />\nexample and that just makes us<br />\nwant to go out and do the same<br />\nthing for the other guys.\"<br />\n\"Many guys, especially<br />\nfreshman, come to Hopkins<br />\nknowing that the school is pretty<br />\ntough and unsure of where that<br />\nleaves them as far as athletics<br />\ngoes. When the pressure starts to<br />\nmount up 'it's up to us to help<br />\nthem out. There is tremendous<br />\nrapport among everyone, all<br />\nclasses, on this team. That's<br />\nalways the way it's been and this<br />\nyear is no exception. Everyone's<br />\npulling for everyone else and that<br />\nworks for the good of the team,\"<br />\nKramer concluded.<br />\nWith this year's talent and<br />\n<br />\nRick Kramer<br />\nleadership (coaches and captains)<br />\nthe outlook is bright for the Blue<br />\nJay eleven, so why not come out<br />\nand see how they look. The one<br />\npoint that both Parker and<br />\nKramer stressed was that there is<br />\nno reason why people shouldn't<br />\nturn out to watch the Blue Jay<br />\ngidders.

You'll<br />\nfunction in an environment which is intellectually<br />\nstimulating and professionally challenging.<br />\nNot all physicians pursue post residency fellowships. But if you are interested, the Air Force conducts them both in-house and at civilian institutions.<br />\nThe physician already in practice can look forward to other things. If you want training in the<br />\npractice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his practice in<br />\n<br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily available.<br />\nHe has many options available to him when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not<br />\nleast, are the satisfactions that come with having<br />\nthe opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missed<br />\nappointment rate that is practically nil.<br />\nWhether you are already a physician, or soon to<br />\nbecome one, you might find it extremely interesting<br />\nto find out what the Air Force has to offer.

Hopkins was defeated<br />\nby a score of 4-0.<br />\nLike any human enterprise,<br />\nsoccer is a sport that can<br />\naccomodate a wide range of<br />\ntalents from the spectacular to<br />\nthe mediocre. Wherever the<br />\nmembers of the JHU squad and<br />\nthe members of the GW squad<br />\nmay fall in this scheme of things,<br />\nthe game of Tuesday last was<br />\nmost certianly a mismathC. The<br />\nColonials are a team endowed<br />\nwith the kind of players that<br />\ncoaches melt for. They are<br />\nconfident, tenacious, talented<br />\n. sportsmen and as such are most<br />\npotent adversaries. From the<br />\noutset, their quick, cat like<br />\npower made itself manifest. They<br />\nplayed with thekind of lyric<br />\nagility that, in a.sport, is as rare<br />\nas it is mesmerizing. Sharp,<br />\nprecision passing and intelligent<br />\ngamesmenship marked their<br />\noffense; their defense seemed to<br />\nspiing from divine inspiration. In<br />\nthe end, they were just too large<br />\na package for the Blue Jays to<br />\nhandle.<br />\nAll the scoring game in the<br />\nfirst half. The first goal was<br />\ncredited to GW lineman Wilfredo<br />\nVenanzeno, who steered a mid<br />\nair pass from the right wing<br />\nsolidly into the center of the<br />\nHopkins net after seven minutes<br />\nof elapsed playing time. Shortly<br />\nthereafter, Kenneth Garber (the<br />\nonly American in George<br />\nWashington's starting lineup)<br />\nsmashed a headhsot past Blue Jay<br />\ngoalie Jack Bukowski, to make<br />\nthe score 2-0.<br />\nThe war raged on<br />\ninconclusively for the next few<br />\nminutes. Hopkins was unable to<br />\neffect the penetration necessary<br />\nto shoot; George Washington was<br />\nable to penetrate at will but shot<br />\nwide of the mark. The Colonial<br />\nstar Nano Darynen moved to the<br />\nfront line and took command.<br />\nWith uncanny cunning and<br />\ndexterity, he managed to wind<br />\n<br />\nhis way past the Blue Jay defense<br />\nand to pay dirt, scoring the last<br />\ntwo goals in quick succession and<br />\nunassisted.<br />\nDust<br />\nThe second half say somewhat<br />\nof a letup on the part of George<br />\nWashington's offense. With a four<br />\ngoal lead, they were in a<br />\nrelatively comfortable position.<br />\nThe Colonial defense, however,<br />\nremained ferocious. Led by deep<br />\nback Imi Vezusi from Botswana<br />\nand Therri Bussard of France,<br />\nthey frustrated all Hopkins<br />\nattempts at some sort of<br />\ncoordinated offense. Vezusi<br />\ntaunted the Hopkins linemen<br />\nwith the confidence of a humgry<br />\nspider who knows that his dinner<br />\nis waiting, cought inextricably, in<br />\nhis web. Bussard was everywhere<br />\nthe ball was and often left his<br />\nBlue Jay rivals in a proverbial<br />\ncloud of dust.<br />\nLike This<br />\nStatistically, it went like this.<br />\nHopkins managed a total of only<br />\nten shots and one corner kick,<br />\ncompared to th rty one shots<br />\nand five corner kicks for George<br />\nWashington.

With inflation rising at a 14 per cent clip this year, a<br />\n10 per cent increase in tuition could be termed modest. Still,<br />\nthe $300 jump is a tough pill to swallow, since families,just<br />\nlike the University, must deal with the higher cost of living in<br />\nevery other aspect of life.<br />\nWhat strikes us most about the hike is the futility that<br />\npeople concerned must feel in response to it. Because of the<br />\ninflation, the University must up the tuition in order to<br />\nbalance its budget. But because of the inflation students<br />\ncannot afford the increase. Like the inflationary spiral itself,<br />\nthere seems to be no way out of the dilemma. \u2022<br />\nAll that students can hope for is that donors to the<br />\nUniversity will continue to contribute to Hopkins as they<br />\nhave in the past, and that University administrators will see<br />\nthat as much money as possible is given towards keeping the<br />\ntuition down.<br />\n,The only real source of aid that can help alleviate the<br />\nproblem must come, like most solutions to current<br />\ncatastrophes, from the federal government. Only with<br />\nworkable and enduring solutions to the problems of<br />\n-inflation\u2014if they do exist at all\u2014can the battle of colleges for<br />\nlife be won. In the meanwhile, we hope that the government<br />\nwill consider the needs of those attending college, and render<br />\naid through work-study programs, scholarships, tax-breaks,<br />\nand the like, so that higher education will remain open to<br />\neveryone, not just the wealthy.<br /><br />\nmost honorable<br />\nThe Honor Commission is charged with the responsibility<br />\nof preventing violations of the University's Honor Code and<br />\nstanding in judgement of such violations as they arise.<br />\nThough there is inherent fallacy in \"enforcing\" an honor<br />\nsystem, we feel that the Commission plays a vital role by<br />\nproviding a source of justice that is uniform and as equitable<br />\nas is possible.<br />\nThe Honor Commission, however, has exceeded those<br />\nlimits within which it functions most effectively, if the<br />\npanel's recent bylaw is any indication. There is no trust when<br />\nprofessors are instructed by the Honor Commission to bring a<br />\nset of blue books to each exam in order to thwart those who<br />\nwould write answers in their own blue books in advance.<br />\nThere is no honor when the Honor Commission tacks up a<br />\nsign in the computer room warning,that \"breaking into other<br />\nstut\u2018ex\u2018xs' cAes\\s<br /><br />\nv'keXavoax wry:\\.74\"a<br />\ndO we<br /><br />\ntteatea as<br /><br />\ncharge to promote, not demean through distrust, the concept<br /><br />\nof honor upon which the University's Honor Code is based.<br /><br />\nI.

Who's going to<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt's really tough for old<br />\nreactionary rightwingers like<br />\nmyself to swallow the dramatic<br />\noutpouring of wrath from the<br />\nleft-liberal axis concerning the<br />\npardon of Richard Nixon. This,<br />\nremember, is the same crowd<br />\nwhich gave us such obscenities as<br />\nthe antiwar movement-, situational<br />\nethics, the drug \"culture\", selective<br />\nlawbreaking, the Democratic convention of 1972, abortion, racial<br />\nquotas, and detente with the<br />\nCommunist system. Recall if you<br />\nwill that the heroes of this bunch<br />\nare such hopeless clowns as<br />\nMcGovern and Fulbright and<br />\nKunstler and Fonda, such moral<br />\nciphers as Mao and Ellsberg and<br />\nCleaver and the Berrigans, and such<br />\nridiculous inanities as Ramsey<br />\nClark and Timothy Leary and<br />\nKingman Brewster and the New<br />\nYork Review of Books. For the<br />\nliberal-left unable to induct Tricky<br />\nDicky into its pantheon of<br />\nglorified fools, liars, thieves,<br />\n.hypocrites, traitors, junkies and<br />\nmurderers is quite an affront<br />\nindeed, ascribable only to blind<br />\nideological hatred and - yes!! - rank<br />\ndiscrimination. Why should a mere<br />\nobstructor of justice be denied his<br />\nequal right to the adulation and<br />\nhero-worship accorded more<br />\nhardened and experienced<br />\ncriminals? Is a conservative (oops,<br />\npseudo -conservative) crook<br />\ngenetically inferior to the liberal<br />\ncrook?

(EXEUNT, CU$TA1N,<br />\nAPPLAUSE).<br />\nDick Oles '68<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn Mark C. Miller's article on<br /><br />\nCesar Chavez's speech, in the<br />\nSeptember 17 Newsletter he wrote<br />\nthat, \"you can make an important<br />\npolitical gesture by simple refusing<br />\nto buy or consume table grapes,<br />\niceberg lettuce, and Gallo and<br />\nother such inferior wines. . .\" This<br />\nis his program for alleviating<br />\nHopkins' political apathy.<br />\nHis advice promotes another<br />\nkind of apathy. He seems to say<br />\nthat by pefsonal adherence to this<br />\nboycott we will all be in the<br />\nvanguard of the struggle for human<br />\nrights. His concluding words are<br />\n\"Join the movement! Fight back<br />\ntoday!\"<br />\nIn his revolutionary enthusiasm<br />\nhe has forgotten to mention, the<br />\nlargest consumer of boycotted<br />\ngoods in the Hopkins community:<br />\nThe Saga Food Service. The<br />\nNewsletter's front page article on<br />\nCesar Chavez's speech also<br />\nneglected to report Mr. Chavez's<br />\nstatement that 'the students at<br />\nHopkins should demand that<br />\nboycotted goods not be bought by<br />\nthe food service. I do not know the<br />\nreason for this double omission;<br />\nthis was one of the most important<br />\nand well received parts of the<br />\nspeech.<br />\nSaga foods is an enthusiastic<br />\nconsumer of lettuce, and table<br />\ngrapes when they are in season.<br />\nThe Newsletter advocates that the<br />\nclients of Saga should simply pass<br />\nby the salad and the grapes. We say<br />\nthat these student should demand<br />\nthat Tom Tanglos, the Saga<br />\nmanager, stop buying boycotted<br />\ngoods.<br />\nGoing beyond individual<br />\nrequests that he stop buying scab<br />\nlettuce, petitions should be<br />\ncirculated and given to Tom<br />\nTanglos. If this brings no result<br />\nmore drastic tactics could be<br />\nemployed.<br />\nAll of this would mainly be the<br />\ntask of the Freshman class. It<br />\ncould have the by-product of<br />\nbreaking the tradition of apathy<br />\nthat has come down from previous<br />\nHopkins classes<br />\nJames Harvey and Colin McGrath<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHaving read Randy Chinnock's<br />\nrecent article about the musical<br />\nactivities at Hopkins, I was<br />\ndisappointed to note that no<br />\nmention was made of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Glee Club. Not<br />\nonly is the Glee Club the oldest<br />\nactivity at Hopkins (founded in<br />\n1883), but it is also very much a<br />\npart of the musical environment,<br />\nperforming a wide variety of sacred<br />\nand secular choral music,<br />\nfrequently with orchestra. Eight<br />\nconcerts are planned in Baltimore<br />\nfor this year, alone, featuring such<br />\nselections as Bach's Magnificat,<br />\nBruckner's Te Deum, Stravinsky's<br />\nSymphony of Psalms, and Vaughn<br />\nWilliams' Dona Nobis Pacem. I<br />\ntrust that this omission was only<br />\nan oversight on the part of the<br />\nauthor, and I expect to see him at<br />\nall of our concerts.<br />\nRalph F.

Without talent a team<br />\ncan't go anywhere; they can't do<br />\nthe impossible. But just sheer<br />\ntalent itself, is likewise no<br />\nguarantee of success. Many teams<br />\nhave been made up of very<br />\ntalented athletes but never<br />\nseemed to emerge victorious. One<br />\nof the other important<br />\ningredients needed for victory is<br />\nleadership. The coaches and<br />\ncaptains of a team play an<br />\nimportant role in how that team<br />\nwill make out during the season.<br />\nThe Hopkins football team has<br />\nbeen fortunate in the past to<br /><br />\nTraining room open<br />\nto every student<br />\nby ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nHow many of you readers out<br />\nthere haven't stepped into a<br />\ngymnasium or onto an athletic<br />\nfield in at least a year? And how<br />\nmany of you (if you already<br />\nmeet the above criterion) used to<br />\nbe Mr. (or Ms.) Varsity Athletic<br />\nWonderperson of your high<br />\nschool? And finally, how many<br />\nof you guilty souls have tried to<br />\nrepent for that loss of athletic<br />\nprowess(or lack of it)?<br />\nThere are probably quite a few<br />\nstill left in the ballgame. Thh<br />\ninformation is for you whc<br />\nhappen to occasionally get the<br />\nurge to tear loose from your<br />\nstudies and trek off to the gym<br />\nfor some exercise or just plain<br />\nfun. Take it easy at first. Don't<br />\nthink you could run down to the<br />\nLax office and pick up a stick<br />\nbecause chances are you'll never<br />\nhave opportunity to prove<br />\nyourself. The reason: injury.<br />\nInjuries account for all you<br />\nhome team woes. What are the<br />\nJets without Joe-Willy, the<br />\nKnicks without Reed, the Tokyo<br />\nSuki-akis without Joe Pepitone??<br />\nBut these professional athletes<br />\nhave professional trainers to treat<br />\ntheir tender expensive injuries<br />\n.which enable them to continue<br />\nplaying. Not only do these<br />\ntrainers treat major injuries, they<br />\nalso specialize in the treatment of<br />\nminor injuries such as muscle<br />\nstrains and smashed shins and<br />\nknees, which can also plaque<br />\nprofessional sports teams without<br />\nproper care being administered.<br />\nSo what's the point of all the<br />\nabove? When all of you make<br />\nthat infrequent trip to the gym,<br />\nthat little pain you felt in your<br />\nankle after coming down with a<br />\nrebound during a hot basketball<br />\ngame may cause you .serious<br />\nproblems if the injury is not<br />\ntreated properly or even not<br />\ntreated at all. But don't fret. You<br />\ncan get as good a treatment as<br />\nany million dollar athlete, right<br />\nhere oi the Homewood campus.<br />\nAll you need to do is hobble to<br />\nthe main floor of the Newton H.<br />\nWhite gym, search for the<br />\ntraining room and point out<br />\nwhere it hurts to head athletic<br />\ntrainer, LeRoy Brandimore.<br />\nThe training room was<br />\n.instrumental in keeping our<br />\nNCAA lax champions healthy<br />\nthroughout the year and on the<br /><br />\nroad to Rutgers. The same<br />\nfacilities are available to members<br />\nof the Hopkins community.<br />\nBrandy won't turn away anyone.<br />\nHe'll treat anything from football<br />\nto chess injuries. The training<br />\nroom has better facilities than<br />\nthe infirmary and is exleusively<br />\ndesigned to handle athletic<br />\ninjuries.<br />\nFacilities include whirlpools,<br />\nhydrocollaters, muscle<br />\nstimulating machines with<br />\nultra-sound and diathermy<br />\ntreatments. The hours the<br />\ntraining room is available range<br />\nfrom about 1 to 3 and from $:30<br />\nto 7. The intervening hours are<br />\nreserved exclusively for Varsity<br />\nand Junior Varsity teams.<br />\nIf Brandy can't help you, there<br />\nis a competent staff of student<br />\ntrainers who can tape up just<br />\nabout any part of the anatomy<br />\nyou .may be inclined to injure.<br />\nThe student trainers include Dave<br />\nSill, a 3 year 'veteran currently<br />\ntravelling with the football team;<br />\nKelly Morron, the only female on<br />\nthe staff who has 2 years<br />\nexperience, and travels with the<br />\ntrack and cross country teams,<br />\nand Steve Lazzaro, member of<br />\nthe Varsity Wrestling team who is<br />\nstarting his second year in the<br />\ntraining room while attending to<br />\nthe needs of the soccer team.<br />\nThere is an opening available in<br />\nthe training for a freshman,<br />\npreferably one with some<br />\nexperience. Contact Brandy for<br />\nmore details.<br />\nSo remember. No matter how<br />\ngraceful you think you may be in<br />\na competitive sprot, you can<br />\nincur an athletic injury. Failure<br />\nto take care of such an injury<br />\ncould lead to further, more<br />\nserious problems. The help you<br />\nneed is in the training room. It's<br />\nset up for all Hopkins users of<br />\ntheir own bodies. So Use It.<br />\nAlso, this last note is directed<br />\nto any concerned university<br />\nofficial interested in keeping the<br />\nquality of our training room<br />\nintact so they can continue to<br />\nkeep Hopkins sports enthusiasts<br />\nhappy by keeping our Jays on<br />\nthe field, no matter what the<br />\nsport. If there's any of that 100<br />\nmillion left, how about an ice<br />\nmachine and even possibly<br />\nkicking in for an air-conditioner<br />\nfor the training room? Maybe the<br />\nwhole gym?<br /><br />\nreceive this leadership from<br />\nextremely c apable people. Last<br />\nyear's co-captians Jack Thomas<br />\nand Gunter Glocker are an<br />\nexample of the high caliber<br />\npeople who have filled this<br />\nposition. This year's co-captians<br />\nare no exceptions. Defensive end<br />\nBruce Parker and defensive back<br />\nRick Kramer are the elected<br />\nseniors who will lead the 1974<br />\nBlue Jay gridders.<br />\nBoth Parker and Kramer hail<br />\nfrom Long Island. Bruce is from<br />\nFarmingdale and Rick is from<br />\nPlainview. Another common<br />\nquality is the athletic versatility<br />\nwhich both men have. Kramer is<br />\na reserve quarterback as well as<br />\nstarting defensive back and he<br />\nplays lacrosse in the spring while<br />\nParker played lacrosse his first<br />\ntwo years at Hopkins while<br />\nplaying both offensive and<br />\ndefensive line on the gridiron in<br />\nthe fall.<br />\nWhen asked about their main<br />\nfunctions while serving as<br />\nco-captains, both players had<br />\nvery definite ideas about their<br />\njob. \"We are responsible for<br />\nproviding leadership for the<br />\nteam\", said Kramer, \"and if<br /><br />\nnecessary putting the team ahead<br />\nof the individual.\"<br />\n\"We try to set an example for<br />\nthe other players to follow.<br />\nSometimes you don't feel like<br />\ngoing out to practice but you<br />\nforce yourself and work that<br />\nmuch harder in the hope that<br />\neveryone else will follow suit.\"<br />\nParker continued \"There were<br />\nsome really top-notch guys who<br />\nheld these positions before us<br />\nand helped us by setting a good<br />\nexample and that just makes us<br />\nwant to go out and do the same<br />\nthing for the other guys.\"<br />\n\"Many guys, especially<br />\nfreshman, come to Hopkins<br />\nknowing that the school is pretty<br />\ntough and unsure of where that<br />\nleaves them as far as athletics<br />\ngoes. When the pressure starts to<br />\nmount up 'it's up to us to help<br />\nthem out. There is tremendous<br />\nrapport among everyone, all<br />\nclasses, on this team. That's<br />\nalways the way it's been and this<br />\nyear is no exception. Everyone's<br />\npulling for everyone else and that<br />\nworks for the good of the team,\"<br />\nKramer concluded.<br />\nWith this year's talent and<br /><br />\nRick Kramer<br />\nleadership (coaches and captains)<br />\nthe outlook is bright for the Blue<br />\nJay eleven, so why not come out<br />\nand see how they look. The one<br />\npoint that both Parker and<br />\nKramer stressed was that there is<br />\nno reason why people shouldn't<br />\nturn out to watch the Blue Jay<br />\ngidders. So be at Homewood<br />\nField on Saturday for the team's<br />\nlast intra-squad scrimmage before<br />\nthe opening game with<br />\nMuhlenberg.<br /><br />\nBecoming a physician is a tremendous<br />\nsatisfaction.<br />\nLet us give you the job satisfaction<br />\nthat should go with it.<br />\nWhether you're still in medical school with the<br />\nrigors of three to five years of graduate medical education still to be faced, or are already a practicing<br />\nphysician, it's our opinion that the Air Force can<br />\noffer both professional and personal satisfaction<br />\nhard to duplicate in civilian life.<br />\nAn overstatement? Not if you consider the<br />\nspecifics.<br />\nTake the problem of graduate medical education. It's a period of your life the Air Force can make<br />\nconsiderably easier with comfortable salary and living conditions.<br />\nCreature comforts aside, the Air Force offers<br />\nprofessional advantages. Besides receiving training<br />\nin your own specialty, you'd be in contact with<br />\nphysicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll<br />\nfunction in an environment which is intellectually<br />\nstimulating and professionally challenging.<br />\nNot all physicians pursue post residency fellowships. But if you are interested, the Air Force conducts them both in-house and at civilian institutions.<br />\nThe physician already in practice can look forward to other things. If you want training in the<br />\npractice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his practice in<br /><br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily available.<br />\nHe has many options available to him when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not<br />\nleast, are the satisfactions that come with having<br />\nthe opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missed<br />\nappointment rate that is practically nil.<br />\nWhether you are already a physician, or soon to<br />\nbecome one, you might find it extremely interesting<br />\nto find out what the Air Force has to offer.

The game was<br />\ncreated last season as a means of<br />\nraising the necessary funds to<br />\nallow the United States All-Star<br />\nlacrosse team to travel to<br />\nAustrailia and participate in the<br />\n1 974 World Series Lacrosse.<br />\nof<br /><br />\nLast year's game was a<br />\nphenomenal success. A crowd of<br />\nover 4,000 fans came to the game<br />\nand the match was covered in<br />\nSports Illustrated. that success<br />\nwas what led Lacrosse Hall of<br />\nFame president Joe Harlan and<br />\nhis committee to extend the life<br />\nof theis affair and make it an<br />\nannual event.<br />\nThe collegiate squad will<br />\nmainly consist of the players who<br />\nwent to Australia and won the<br /><br />\nNEWS1ETTER<br /><br />\nworld lacrosse title for the<br />\nUnited States. Included on the<br />\nroster are six members of last<br />\nyear's Hopkins NCAA<br />\nchampionship team. Leading the<br />\nsextet is Jack Thomas who was<br />\nhailed in the.

Hopkins was defeated<br />\nby a score of 4-0.<br />\nLike any human enterprise,<br />\nsoccer is a sport that can<br />\naccomodate a wide range of<br />\ntalents from the spectacular to<br />\nthe mediocre. Wherever the<br />\nmembers of the JHU squad and<br />\nthe members of the GW squad<br />\nmay fall in this scheme of things,<br />\nthe game of Tuesday last was<br />\nmost certianly a mismathC. The<br />\nColonials are a team endowed<br />\nwith the kind of players that<br />\ncoaches melt for. They are<br />\nconfident, tenacious, talented<br />\n. sportsmen and as such are most<br />\npotent adversaries. From the<br />\noutset, their quick, cat like<br />\npower made itself manifest. They<br />\nplayed with thekind of lyric<br />\nagility that, in a.sport, is as rare<br />\nas it is mesmerizing. Sharp,<br />\nprecision passing and intelligent<br />\ngamesmenship marked their<br />\noffense; their defense seemed to<br />\nspiing from divine inspiration. In<br />\nthe end, they were just too large<br />\na package for the Blue Jays to<br />\nhandle.<br />\nAll the scoring game in the<br />\nfirst half. The first goal was<br />\ncredited to GW lineman Wilfredo<br />\nVenanzeno, who steered a mid<br />\nair pass from the right wing<br />\nsolidly into the center of the<br />\nHopkins net after seven minutes<br />\nof elapsed playing time. Shortly<br />\nthereafter, Kenneth Garber (the<br />\nonly American in George<br />\nWashington's starting lineup)<br />\nsmashed a headhsot past Blue Jay<br />\ngoalie Jack Bukowski, to make<br />\nthe score 2-0.<br />\nThe war raged on<br />\ninconclusively for the next few<br />\nminutes. Hopkins was unable to<br />\neffect the penetration necessary<br />\nto shoot; George Washington was<br />\nable to penetrate at will but shot<br />\nwide of the mark. The Colonial<br />\nstar Nano Darynen moved to the<br />\nfront line and took command.<br />\nWith uncanny cunning and<br />\ndexterity, he managed to wind<br /><br />\nhis way past the Blue Jay defense<br />\nand to pay dirt, scoring the last<br />\ntwo goals in quick succession and<br />\nunassisted.<br />\nDust<br />\nThe second half say somewhat<br />\nof a letup on the part of George<br />\nWashington's offense. With a four<br />\ngoal lead, they were in a<br />\nrelatively comfortable position.<br />\nThe Colonial defense, however,<br />\nremained ferocious. Led by deep<br />\nback Imi Vezusi from Botswana<br />\nand Therri Bussard of France,<br />\nthey frustrated all Hopkins<br />\nattempts at some sort of<br />\ncoordinated offense. Vezusi<br />\ntaunted the Hopkins linemen<br />\nwith the confidence of a humgry<br />\nspider who knows that his dinner<br />\nis waiting, cought inextricably, in<br />\nhis web. Bussard was everywhere<br />\nthe ball was and often left his<br />\nBlue Jay rivals in a proverbial<br />\ncloud of dust.<br />\nLike This<br />\nStatistically, it went like this.<br />\nHopkins managed a total of only<br />\nten shots and one corner kick,<br />\ncompared to th rty one shots<br />\nand five corner kicks for George<br />\nWashington.
