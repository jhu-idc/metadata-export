He and<br />\n\"Let Freedom Ring\" are trying to<br />\ncounteract this radical trend.<br />\nThere are 450 stations in the<br />\nnation. Two of these are in Maryland.

They<br />\nshould concentrate more on the<br />\nAmerican Constitution.<br />\nAlso, they should set up a system of absolute values which the<br />\nstudents must learn. \"I don't believe in this business of gray,\" Mr.<br />\nBertram stated. \"It's all black and<br />\nwhite to me. A man is either dead<br />\nor alive, you know.\"<br />\nFurthermore, the universities<br />\nshould teach \"the truth about<br />\nAmerican History.. . . a very rare<br />\nthing today.\" As an example of<br />\nhow schools have been falsifying<br />\nour nation's history, Mr. Bertram<br />\nsaid that students were being<br />\ntaught that the American Revolution was treason too, \"which it<br />\nwas not.

Russia has already<br />\ncancelled several cultural events<br />\ndue to the Vietnam War, among<br />\nthem the Boishoi Ballet's scheduled appearance this Spring. Professor Slusser, professor of Russian and<br />\nRevolutionary history, discounts<br />\nthe role of international reprisal<br />\nin the cancellation.<br />\nBoth men agree, however, that<br />\none is more apt to find the answer<br />\nin the Soviet government's repression of literary dissidents.

Traditionally<br />\nthey are asexual, unemotional,<br />\nand (almost as a point of honor, if<br />\nnot consistency)superficial. If you<br />\nwould care to look into the embarrassing history of yearbooks<br />\nboth here at Hopkins and at other<br />\nuniversities, there are in the Barn<br />\ndecades of yearbooks which, except for the title pages, are virtually indistinguishable. They<br />\nspeak of nothing in particular;t<br />\nthey speak to no one in particular.<br />\nExcept for changes in . style of<br />\ndress, they all could have come<br />\nout of the same time and place.<br />\nThe notable exceptions among the<br />\nHullabaloos are at the turn of the<br />\ncentury, when they had a distinct<br />\ncharacter \u2014 a beautifully naive optimism about the future \u2014 and in<br />\n1964 \u2014 when Lehman and Drell<br />\ntried their hands at self-concious<br />\nmedia manipulation. The 1967<br />\nHullabaloo.also is an exception.<br />\nWe thought it justifiable (if we<br />\nshould be called to justify it) but<br />\neven more, valuable, to make the<br />\n1967 Hullabaloo a book, a real<br />\nbook, that had a subjective point<br />\nof view, that could be read, alone,<br />\nnow or thirty years from now,<br />\nwith the feeling that something intangible \u2014 something of what Hopkins was for us in 1967, and what<br />\nit has meant for us to be here four<br />\nyears \u2014 had been captured.

With the production of a<br />\nmajor documentary nearly completed by students here, yesterday's<br />\nfaint hopes for a film department at Hopkins seems a little more<br />\nrealistic.<br />\nIt is with the hope that the News-Letter devotes a major part of<br />\nthis issue to the subject of filmmaking at Hopkins, to the students<br />\nwho are working on films and to the philosophical and educational<br />\njustifications for a unversity sponsored film department.<br />\nThe following article appeared in the News-Letter last year, and<br />\nwe offer it again in hopes that it will be better read and more accepted this time<br />\nFilm, through television and the movies, has come to comprise an<br />\nimportant part of the modern environment. Social and political<br />\nviews, and life styles including many forms of aberrant behavior<br />\nhave been initiated and constantly tended to by the mass media.<br />\nFor any student born after 1945, a knowledge of the technology,<br />\nartistic principles, and artistic history of the mass media will be an<br />\ninvaluable aid toward understanding his environment. For a humanities student or a social scientist, the ability to decipher the strange<br />\nways of the media and what they tell us about our society will indispensable for creative social contribution. In addition to equipping<br />\nscholars'and educating citizens, film study in the university opens a<br />\nnew avenue of expression.<br />\nAnother need that has been articulated is that the university must<br />\nplay a role in the community and cast off its ivory tower aloofness.<br />\nRecently almost every public figure has at one convocation or another<br />\nsaid that the university, its faculty and its students, must recognize<br />\nand accept new and challenging social realities, that it must not forsake the community for esoteric research. Scholarship must assume<br />\na new role; one likely form for this committment to take is film production because film is at present the most universal educational<br />\nmedium. Could not the u\u201diversity extend its function best by producing films which explore important areas of social change?<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is not and never will be a trades school.<br />\nIts film department could never reach the proportions of a school<br />\nlike U.S.C. whose money comes from the movie industry, whose<br />\nstudents learn industry techniques and ultimately join the industry<br />\nafter they graduate. Its function is terminal.<br />\nHopkins on the other hand would use film to further a student's<br />\nexploration of his environment, to develop a critical sense toward<br />\na medium that continues to grow. When you consider that last year<br />\nthere were more films produced than books written, you begin to see<br />\nhow valuable a knowledge of film may be in the future. Film at Hopkins,giving the student a deeper understanding of the world he lives<br />\nin, would be instrumental in approach. The problems of the Cinemascope screen, though very real to a student at U.S.C. would never<br />\nconcern us here. Students here will be more concerned with content<br />\nand treatment.<br />\nThe issue of whether a film program should be included<br />\nin the<br />\nUniversity curriculum is a very real one and it has to do<br />\nwith the<br />\nsurvival of Liberal Arts education. The world is changing<br />\nrapidly and<br />\nfilm is intimately tied to its development. If Hopkins is to<br />\nmeet its<br />\ncommittment to this pressing reality \u2014 at least one of the<br />\nways it<br />\ncould do so is by initiating a program in film study.<br />\n<br />\nMemories Are Made of This<br />\nA yearbook may be the most abused art form currentl<br />\ny in existence.

Then he called up a<br />\nfew musician friends like Ravi<br />\nand Ornette to write a little something. Then he traveled to India,<br />\nMontana, New York, the California Redwoods, Mexico,and France<br />\nfor three years making the movie<br />\nand dispensing with somethinr<br />\nnear $1,000,000 (which shouid<br />\nmake Chappaqua the most expensive Underground flick yet).<br />\n<br />\nThe credit for the movie as it<br />\nstands must be given to the film<br />\neditor, Kenout Peltier, and the<br />\ncameraman, Robert Frank (Pull<br />\nMy Daisy). From all appearances,<br />\nthe film's Ramparts slickness was<br />\ncreated in the cutting room. The<br />\nphotography is easily the highpoint<br />\nof the movie. There is an effective<br />\nhit-and-miss cohesion in the techniques employed. The plot line is<br />\ncarried by various shades of nitty<br />\ngritty black and white, with flashbacks to hallucinations in color,<br />\nmuted filters, and sepia. The effects are interesting, beautiful,<br />\neven worth watching. But any<br />\nGestalt evaluation turns out negative at the end of the movie.<br />\nWe have to go under the assumption that Rooks produced a<br />\nmovie, not an \"experiment\". In<br />\nthis movie, dialogue and acting is<br />\nlacking. The dialogue is self-consciously extemporaneous where it<br />\nshould have been direct and sparing. Jean-Louis Barrault looked<br />\nembarrassed about the whole affect. (Our hero is attempting a<br />\n<br />\ndrug cure. He sees himself skating<br />\nby. \"Get away, hallucinations.\"<br />\nOh, Really?)<br />\nLet's examine this idea of movie<br />\nversus experiment a bit closer. This<br />\nbrings us to the subject of Conrad<br />\nRooks' ego. He must have one.<br />\nMaybe even a big one. Which is<br />\nnone of my business, but when he<br />\ninjects it into this movie like so<br />\nmuch heroin he pretty well dopes<br />\nthings up. Chappaqua is a movie<br />\nabout drug addiction, and we are<br />\nfaced with descriptions of drug<br />\nexperiences. Now, it seems that<br />\ndrugs- are a type of anti-social behavior, non-communicative except<br />\nwith your own mind. If Chappaqua<br />\nwas made in this spirit, then it is a<br />\nsmashing success, it is non-communicative. But we are introduced<br />\nto a plot, a vehicle, we are led to<br />\nbelieve that it was supposed to be<br />\nsomething else also \u2014 the story of<br />\na drug addict or something. Complications arise when there is a<br />\ntheme of film within the film<br />\nstructure. Very well done, incidently.

The Social Relations department agreed.<br />\nInvolved in the original conception of the film were<br />\nthree expierenced Hopkins film makers active in the<br />\nFilm Workshop for the last three years: Carl Chatzky,<br />\nKen Locker and Jamil Simon. Carl Chatzky has been<br />\ninvolved with the university in one capacity or another<br />\nfor the past fourteen years. He has produced a number of experimental films and was one of the original<br />\nmotivating forces in film at Hopkins. Ken Locker, a<br />\nsenior majoring in Humanities, has gained intensive<br />\nprofessional experience in the last year. This past summer he filmed and directed a fifteen minute documentary film for VISTA which was shown nationally on<br />\neducational television this fall. Jamil Simon is a senior<br />\nmajoring in Art History and an experienced still photographer. This summer he worked as a film editor in a<br />\nLondon film studio.<br />\nThe opportunity for a group of students to work<br />\nas .an independent group for an academic department<br />\n'5 indeed unique at Hopkins.

Hopefully, in the future, similar mutually beneficial projects can be undertaken by student film makers and<br />\nacademic departments of the university.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n;-<br />\n<br />\nis<br />\n1.<br />\n<br />\n:e<br />\n<br />\ny,<br />\n.h<br />\nes<br />\nes<br />\nas<br />\nes<br />\n<br />\nlie<br />\nds<br />\ncc<br />\nLie<br />\n\u2022ry<br />\nus<br />\n<br />\nus<br />\n:11ni<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFilm: A Creative<br />\nCompromise In Art<br />\nAfter completing negotiations with the Social Relations department to produce a film on game simulations, the members of the Film Workshop, under the<br />\ndirection of Carl Chatzky, Ken Locker and Jamil<br />\nSimon, were left with the problem of deciding on an<br />\napproach to the film itself.<br />\nThe concept of high-school students playing games<br />\nwhich simulate and dramatize certain aspects of their<br />\nenvironment presents many cinematic possibilities.<br />\nFirst, there is the contrast of learning through games<br />\nand through traditional methods of education. Secondly there is the contrast of situations which arise in the<br />\ngames contrasted against analagous situations which<br />\narise in real life. Within this basic structure we also<br />\nwanted to show graduate students and faculty members at Hopkins developing the games,and perhaps the<br />\nreactions of teachers using the games in the classroom.<br />\nWe decided to approach the film as a documentary<br />\nshooting in synchronized sound. In order to rent two<br />\nblimped and synced cameras and an interlock tape recorder the cost came to $100 a day. At this cost, we<br />\nwere able to rent the equipment for a week. Tom<br />\nBray, audio consultant for Barton Hall, agreed to do<br />\nthe sound recording for a nominal fee and to let us<br />\nuse additional microphones and mixers for no charge.<br />\nIn order for us to complete our shooting in this<br />\n<br />\nFILM<br />\nlimited period of time it was necessary to compromise<br />\nour original documentary approach and work from a<br />\ntightly organized shooting script. We decided to divide<br />\nour shooting into four parts: the graduate students<br />\ndeveloping the game, the students playing the game, a<br />\ntraditional classroom situation and the real life situations reflected in the game.<br />\nAfter many revisions we finally came up with a<br />\ncoherent shooting script. We found that a large part of<br />\nthe success of the film depended upon finding the<br />\nproper group of students to play the game. We were<br />\nfortunate in being able to arrange with John Roemer<br />\nof the Baltimore Friends School to use his eleventh<br />\ngrade history class. In order to maximize the usage<br />\nof the rented equipment we decided to have several<br />\npractice sessions with the Friends School students.<br />\nPrior to our final shooting in the Clipper room of<br />\nShriver Hall we found that in spite of its excellent<br />\nlighting, the acoustical properties made its use impossible. This turned out to be one of the major problems<br />\nwe faced during the entire filming: finding rooms<br />\nwhich were acoustical so that we could record intelligible conversations with moderate ambient background noise.<br />\nOur second major problem, especially with the<br />\nhigh school students, was to obtain dialogue that didn't<br />\nsound unnatural or unduly stilted. In order to overcome this problem we again had to compromise certain aspects of our script. We found that in order to<br />\nmaximize the spontanaity of the dialogue we. were<br />\nforced to abandon a strict script with a precise and<br />\npreplanned dialogue. In effect our shooting sessions<br />\nturned out to be small waiting games. The sound<br />\ncameraman was sitting in a wheel chair with the camera assistant waiting behind him poised and ready to<br />\nmove at the director's signal. Tom Bray devised a<br />\nrather unique communications system between the<br />\ncameraman,director and soundinan. The director(Carll<br />\nChatzky, the cameramen (Ken Locker and Jamil Simon)and the soundmen(Tom Bray and Fred Portnoy)<br />\nwere all able to listen to the sound as it was being recorded; the director, through the use of a small micorphone was able to talk to the camera man, telling<br />\nhim when and where to shoot, and to his sound man,<br />\ntelling him which microphone to fade in and out on.<br />\nAll of this could be done without disturbing the actual playing of the game without distracting conversations among the technical crew.<br />\nOther everpresent problems were the incompatibility of electric current available at the shooting locations and the amount of additional light we would<br />\nhave to provide. Jim Barber and Joel Crawford handled the electrical and lighting problems, in some instances having to use 15,000 watts of light and finding<br />\nthe necessary current.<br />\n<br />\nThe Reel World<br />\nof Johns Hopkins<br />\nThe Film Workshop has evolved over the last three<br />\nyears from a group of students with little more than<br />\ntheir intense interest in film-making and their ideas to<br />\na full fledged course with camera equipment, some<br />\nmoney and a place to work.<br />\nThere were several breaks to account for the<br />\nchange. The first was recognition and financial support from the Student Activities Commission. The<br />\nsecond was a room to work in Levering Hall contributed by Dr. Wickwire and beautifully outfitted with<br />\nlights and outlets by Mr. Sciven, the head electrician<br />\nand Mr. Peach, the plant manager.The third break was<br />\nsome editing equipment contributed by Ken Locker<br />\nand the fourth was the enthusiastic committment of<br />\nthe students enrolled in the course.<br />\nWhile Ken Locker and Jamil Simon were planning<br />\nthe film for the Social Relations Department, the students were making their first short films. Jim Barber,<br />\nthe editor of the yearbook and still photographer did<br />\nhis first film on a peace demonstration at Washington<br />\nSquare. His second was an abstract, black and white.<br />\ndream sequence.<br />\nJoel Ziskin did a dramatic narrative on the \"Triumph of Evil and the Loss of Innocence\".

Ted Fahn did two films, his<br />\nfirst a religious satire and his second an unusually effective combination of light bulbs and jazz.<br />\nRoger Toll, editor of the News-Letter did three<br />\nfilms: The Zoo, Light and Movement,and Film-making. Jamil Simon did a short training film, How to<br />\nMake Baklava (a rare arabic pastry). Ken Locker went<br />\ndown to B.

Hopkins' Dr.<br />\nJames Coleman, Professor of Social Relations, has been a leader<br />\nin \"simulated-environment\" researchers received a $200,000<br />\ngrant from the Carnegie Foundation in 1962.<br />\nDr. Coleman refers to this learning tool as \"using highly structured<br />\ngames for learning at all levels of<br />\neducation and for learning in a<br />\nwide variety of environments.\"<br />\nStudents playing the game, thus,<br />\n\"learn not by formal teaching, but<br />\nby acting in an environment created by the rules of the game.\"<br />\nThe games \"are designed to extract from the complex world of<br />\nreality a particular fragment of the<br />\nenvironment,\" he adds.\"The player then finds himself coping with<br />\nthat fragment.\"<br />\nFor example, in playing a democracy game, students learn how<br />\nthe system of representative democracy functions by acting out<br />\nthe role of a legislator. They better<br />\nunderstand the complexity of<br />\ngovernment and the role of a legislator in that fragment of their<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nMost of the simulated-environment games which have been constructed are in the field of the Social Sciences.. Besides the democracy game, there is an international simulation game, a consumer economics game, a life career<br />\ngame, a game simulating the conditions of England during the Industrial Revolution, a parent-child<br />\ngame,a community action game, a<br />\npropaganda game, an economic<br />\nsystem game and others.<br />\nChildren often achieve more<br />\n\"learning in an environment\" than<br />\nthey do with formal teaching. Dr.<br />\nColeman cites the learning of a language as an example of learning in<br />\nan environment. He adds that<br />\nmany children who learn something as complex as language while<br />\nin an environment may have trouble learning much simpler things<br />\nwhile in school. \"The cause may<br />\nwell be,\" he states, \"that being<br />\ntaught in school is simply not as<br />\neffective fof learning as are the<br />\nenvironments within which they<br />\nlearn to talk.\"<br />\nThe most striking result of the<br />\ngames in the classroom is motivation. No one has to push students<br />\ninto playing. More often, they<br />\npush reluctant teachers into letting them play.<br />\nAnother major problem in the<br />\nclassroom which the games may be<br />\nable to eliminate is that of the conflict between the teacher's role as<br />\nJudge and helper. In a normal situation, one of the teacher primary functions is to give marks.<br />\nDr. Coleman believes that \"As a<br />\nresult, students develop attitudes<br />\ntoward the teacher that can greatly interfer with learning: hostility,<br />\nservility, alienation . \"<br />\nBut simulated - environment<br />\ngames are self-judging. The player<br />\nknows he has won or lost by his<br />\nown actions. The teacher need no<br />\nlonger be the judge, but instead<br />\ncan serve as a helper to all of the<br />\nPlayers.<br />\nGames are particularly effective<br />\nfor the poorly motivated student.<br />\nOften this student develops negagive attitudes toward school and<br />\n<br />\n1,<br />\n<br />\ntends to think of himself as a failure. Dr. Coleman believes that the<br />\ngames help this student to abandon his negative attitude. Games<br />\nmay be the answer to the problems<br />\nof the inner-city schools. They<br />\nmay provide the tools and the<br />\nmotivation to make school a vital<br />\npart of the ghetto children's lives.<br />\nMoreover, games are effective<br />\nfor the gifted child who has become disillusioned with the system<br />\nbecause it offers him no opportunity for \"spectacular achievement.\" Games provide this opportunity and allow the student to<br />\ndevelop ideas of his own.<br />\nAt present, the simulation games are used mainly in tests and<br />\nexperimentation. Most of the testing takes place in Baltimore<br />\nschools, but schools from Florida<br />\nto California are trying out the<br />\ngames. Currently, the Hopkins research group is swamped with<br />\nmore requests than it can handle<br />\nfrom schools that want to institute the games in their curriculum.<br />\n<br />\nOver 400 French and Japanese<br />\nuniversity scientists appealed to<br />\ntheir \"American colleagues\" to refuse to allow their universities to<br />\nbe used for military and secret research.<br />\nCiting the \"ethical and professional responsibilities\" of the world<br />\nscientific community to willingly<br />\nrefuse to permit their discoveries<br />\nto be utilized for destructive purposes, the foregin scholars indicated that a continuation of military<br />\nfunctions on American campuses<br />\nwould \"lead to the determination<br />\nof an ever-growing number of<br />\nworld scientists and universities to<br />\ninterrupt their relations\" with involved U.S. universities, endangering traditional scientific exchanges<br />\nand conferences among world<br />\nscholars.<br />\nAmong the 433 signers of the<br />\nstatement are Nobel Prize-winner<br />\nAlfred Kastler, Field Prize-winner<br />\nLaurent Schwartz, Shoichi Sakata,<br />\nNobel Prize in Physics, Shinichiro<br />\nTomonaga, Nobel Prize in Physics<br />\nand Hideki Yukawa, Nobel Prize<br />\nin Physics.<br />\n<br />\nThe statement especially designated university-based research<br />\nin chemical and biological warfare<br />\nand other techniques of warfare<br />\nagainst civilian populations as a<br />\n\"grave violation\" of professional<br />\nethics. The signers supported those<br />\nnumerous American scholars who<br />\nhave opposed the war in Vietnam.<br />\nThe declaration, which was initiated by a number of scholars including Prof. Laurent Schwartz of<br />\nthe University of Paris, is also a<br />\nresponse to the controversy over<br />\nmilitary and classified research<br />\nwhich has wracked so many American universities in the past two<br />\nyears. In fiscal 1967 the Defense<br />\nDepartment allocated $449 million in resealch contracts to American universities, and in the prior<br />\nyear over 40 universities held contracts for chemical warfare research.<br />\nIn the past year, however, such<br />\nschools as the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, New York University, and Minnesota have moved<br />\nto eliminate such research.<br />\n<br />\nwas examined. The plan was to discover the attitudes toward the<br />\nprogram and to analyze the effectiveness of the practice of family<br />\nplanning. The finding of these<br />\npilot plans led to recommendations incorporated in the present<br />\nnationwide plan for population<br />\ncontrol in West Pakistan.<br />\nThe new program, begun two<br />\nyears ago, is a series of studies<br />\naimed at evaluating the current<br />\nfamily planning program.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nComplete, Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\nRUFF DRY & FOLD<br />\nSHIRTS\u2014DRY CLEANING<br />\n<br />\nWaverly Laundromat<br />\n3330 GREENMOUNT AVE..<br />\n457-2121<br />\n<br />\nSystems are<br />\neveryone's<br />\nbusiness at<br />\nSanders<br />\nThat means you can prove yourself sooner here<br />\nAt Sanders, what you are is as important as what you can do \u2014<br />\nwhat you contribute to the development of new systems.

Of the four<br />\nJay league games remaining, one<br />\n(Dickinson) can be rated a safe<br />\nwin, and another (Western Maryland) a tossup: the back-to-back<br />\nDrexel and Ursinus clashes should<br />\nthus make or break the Homewood hoop season, and the former's psychological impact on the<br />\nlatter might be significant.<br />\nDrexel, which recently lost<br />\nHead Coach Sam Couzen for medical reasons, is 10-3 overall thus far<br />\nand possesses the same characteristics \u2014 size, defense, and depth,<br />\nwhich was most important to its<br />\nwinners of past years. The Dragon<br />\nstarting lineup, featuring four lettermen, averages 6-3; it has scored<br />\nat a 69.6 clip while allowing a game<br />\naverage of 64.2 (Hopkins: 75.1);<br />\nand has at least five reserves who<br />\nhave seen substantial game action.<br />\nDrexel's top individual performer<br />\nis 6-5 Senior center Jack Linderman, who after twelve games was<br />\naveraging 20.3 points and 15.0 rebounds per contest.<br />\nHopkins'last two M.A.C. losses,<br />\nof which Ciccarone was \"realistically hoping to win one\", were, in<br />\nthe varsity mentor's words, \"especially disappointing as regards<br />\nour defensive work and rebounding.\" The team allowed an average<br />\nof 86 points in those contests, let<br />\nits opponents shoot at a combined<br />\n44% floor rate; and, was outrebounded 63-43 by F&M's sizable<br />\nsquad by 56-44 by a much smaller<br />\nMuhlenburg group.<br />\n<br />\nAlso factors in the losses were<br />\nso-so team shooting (37% for the<br />\ntwo games), good opposition performances,a rash of injuries, and a<br />\nnot-inconsiderable amount of bad<br />\nluck: the latLer two deserve further mention. Soph forward Geoff<br />\nThomas was sidelined for both<br />\ngames with a sprained ankle, Jim<br />\nCalli hobbled by a Charley Horse<br />\nin his thigh, and Mike Sullivan and<br />\nRich Thielke bothered by wrist<br />\nsprains.<br />\nThe \"luck\" factor assumed importance against F&M,where Hopkins, down 40-34 at the half and<br />\n66-52 with ten minutes left, closed<br />\nto within three by 4:05. With<br />\nabout 3:30 remaining, Sullivan<br />\nwas sprung open on a fast break,<br />\nbut upon a \"block\" of his attempted layup, F&M quickly capitalized<br />\non a three-point play to turn a<br />\npossible one-point Jay deficit into<br />\na six-counter Diplomat edge<br />\n\"From the standpoints of team<br />\nmomentum and the final margin,\"<br />\ncommented Ciccarone, that shot<br />\nstop by F&M was the key play of<br />\nthe game.\" It was very likely also<br />\ngoal-tending.

Against Drexel,<br />\nthe Jays discovered a new way to<br />\ngive away points \u2014 by not providing visual lap counters in the 500<br />\nyd. free-style event. The rules<br />\nstate that the home team must<br />\nprovide visual lap counters or forfeit the points in that event.<br />\nFor some reason, known only<br />\nto the upper echelon of the athletic department, the swimming<br />\nteam has yet to be given such<br />\ncounters. Although swimming is<br />\nsupposedly a dignified sport, the<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins wrestling team<br />\nbattles Ursinus tomorrow evening<br />\nat 8:00 p.m. with hopes of improving their shaky 3-3 record after<br />\nungracefully handing Western<br />\nMaryland a gift victory last Wednesday evening.

Late in the third period with<br />\nDryden down by a 6-4 score, but<br />\nneeding only a takedown to win<br />\nbecause of riding time, a fluke<br />\ninjury occured and Dick badly<br />\ninjured his right elbow. Fowler of<br />\nWestern Maryland was given the<br />\nwin by default; but even worse<br />\nwas the fact that Dryden may now<br />\nbe lost until tournament time.<br />\nThere is no one on the varsity<br />\nto fill in at the 123 lb. class; and<br />\nin addition, the grapplers were \u2022<br />\nforced to forfeit at 130 lb. because<br />\nGreg Evans could not make weight.<br />\nCharles Coker continued his winning ways at 137 lb. by decisioning<br />\nMeyers, 16-4.<br />\nBill LaCorte, wrestling in his<br />\nfirst varsity match at 145 lb.,<br />\nshowed signs that he wished he<br />\nwasn't out there.

Once again<br />\nHopkins opened the card with<br />\nseven quick points in the medley<br />\nrelay,won all but one event and<br />\nupped their Homewood pool record to a perfect 3-0.<br />\n<br />\nWith the season more than half<br />\nover, it might be a good idea to<br />\ntake stock of the team. While the<br />\nsuccess of the squad is welcomed<br />\nand hailed, it is also evident that<br />\nthe full potential of the team has<br />\nyet to be reached. With the exception of the 200 yd breaststroke<br />\nthe Jays can enter competent<br />\nswimmers in all events and field a<br />\nformidable medley and freestyle<br />\nevents,there is no real depth.<br />\n<br />\nThis can be primarily attributed<br />\nto lack of numbers, since the varsity squad carries only ten swimmers and two divers, but part of<br />\nthe reason can also be found in<br />\nthe fact that a second backstroker,<br />\nbutterflier and two breaststrokers<br />\nhave yet to be developed. A team<br />\nthat advertises for swimmers without previous experience but with<br />\ninterest only, must be held responsible for developing those inexperienced swimmers in events in<br />\nwhich the team is weak.

Unaware<br />\nTwo major problems must be<br />\nfaced before the Joint Statement<br />\nbecomes widely accepted as a<br />\nstrong affirmation of student's<br />\nrights. One is how well it will be<br />\nadopted by college administrators,<br />\npushed for by students, and enforced by the national organizations. Student support is of the<br />\nutmost importance. The Student<br />\nCouncil at Hopkins is unaware of<br />\nthe Joint Statement.<br />\nThe second problem is the<br />\nwording of the statement itself.<br />\nThe committee that drafted the<br />\nJoint Statement proposed that<br />\none way to make the statement<br />\nmore meaningful. would to be get<br />\nthe agencies which accredit colleges and universities to agree to<br />\nwithdraw accreditation from colleges that violate the statement.<br />\nThis proposal would allow students to threaten the administration with a loss of accreditation if<br />\nthey were not granted at least the<br />\nminimal rights outlined in the<br />\ndocument.<br />\nBill Bogged Down<br />\nThe Student's Bill of Rights at<br />\nHopkins contains many of the provisions outlined in the Joint Statement, It calls, for, among other<br />\nthings, freedom of off-campus activities, for student participation<br />\nin the formulation of rules pertaining to students activity, for<br />\nfreedom of the press and for freedom of the stddents to have institutional service records made<br />\navailable to them.<br />\nProceedings and debates between the faculty and the Student<br />\nCouncil is continually slowed<br />\ndown, however, by objections to<br />\nthe wording of some points and by<br />\ndiscussions of side issues raised by<br />\nthe Bill.<br />\nThe Academic Council has appointed a three-man committee<br />\nconsisting of Robert Bilgrave.

L. Bertram, the<br />\n\"station\" in Baltimore for Let<br />\nFreedom Ring Inc.<br />\n\"Let Freedom Ring\" is a \"conservative, patriotic organization\"<br />\nwhich runs a nationwide telephone<br />\nhook-up to further the cause of<br />\ndemocracy. Mr. Bertram is the<br />\n\"station\" for the Baltimore area.<br />\nHe pays for a telephone line to be<br />\ncontinually open, warning of the<br />\nimminent Communist menace.<br />\nMr. Bertram stated that the infiltration and subversive activities<br />\non the campus were particularly<br />\nobvious within the ranks of the<br />\nfaculty. The leaders in the recent<br />\nrash of demonstrations are Communist agitators. Mr. Bertram garners most of his information from<br />\ncongressional hearings. Although<br />\nhe had no evidence that Hopkins<br />\nwas being infiltrated, he suspected<br />\nthat it had not been omitted from<br />\nthe plot.<br />\nBig Brother TIMES<br />\n\"The Communist menace is<br />\nseen mostly in propaganda. All of<br />\nthe editorials of the major publications take the Communist line in<br />\none form or another. As a matter<br />\nof fact, the New York Times is a<br />\ntransmission belt for the Communists,\" Mr. Bertram added. He and<br />\n\"Let Freedom Ring\" are trying to<br />\ncounteract this radical trend.<br />\nThere are 450 stations in the<br />\nnation. Two of these are in Maryland. In most major cities of the<br />\ncountry, one can call a number,<br />\nand be forwarned of the Commu-<br /><br />\nnists' latest tactics. This week, the<br />\ntranscribed message tells of the<br />\nemasculation of the New York<br />\nCity Police Force. Subversives are<br />\ninfiltrating the force and weakening it. Mr. Bertram receives the<br />\nscripts each week from L.F.R.<br />\nheadquarters in Sarasota, Florida.<br />\nHe then puts them on tape for<br />\nplay-back over the telephone.<br />\n\"We know that many police<br />\nforces have been infiltrated. Certain radical interests plan to control the police departments,\" Bertram stated. He added that the<br />\nWatts riots had been planned for<br />\nfive years, but could not be carried out until the police force in<br />\nLos Angeles had been thoroughly<br />\ninfiltrated.<br />\nConstitution Concentration<br />\nThe universities are partially at<br />\nfault for fostering the Communist<br />\nmenace in the country today.<br />\nThey are not teaching correctly<br />\naccording to Mr. Bertram. They<br />\nshould concentrate more on the<br />\nAmerican Constitution.<br />\nAlso, they should set up a system of absolute values which the<br />\nstudents must learn. \"I don't believe in this business of gray,\" Mr.<br />\nBertram stated. \"It's all black and<br />\nwhite to me. A man is either dead<br />\nor alive, you know.\"<br />\nFurthermore, the universities<br />\nshould teach \"the truth about<br />\nAmerican History.. . . a very rare<br />\nthing today.\" As an example of<br />\nhow schools have been falsifying<br />\nour nation's history, Mr. Bertram<br />\nsaid that students were being<br />\ntaught that the American Revolution was treason too, \"which it<br />\nwas not. It was a classic defense<br />\nofthe traditional English liberties.\"<br /><br />\nMysterious Circumstances Abound<br />\nIn Vosnesensky's Cancellation<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br /><br />\nreturn alone.<br />\nProfessor Gilison of Political<br />\nScience and a specialist in Soviet<br />\nand Eastern European Affairs suggested that one of the reasons for<br />\nthe cancellation could be the<br />\nSoviet Government's opposition to<br />\nthe American intervention in the<br />\nVietnam War. Russia has already<br />\ncancelled several cultural events<br />\ndue to the Vietnam War, among<br />\nthem the Boishoi Ballet's scheduled appearance this Spring. Professor Slusser, professor of Russian and<br />\nRevolutionary history, discounts<br />\nthe role of international reprisal<br />\nin the cancellation.<br />\nBoth men agree, however, that<br />\none is more apt to find the answer<br />\nin the Soviet government's repression of literary dissidents.

It is<br />\nknown that it was the Writer's<br />\nUnion which prevented Voznesensky from appearing at Lincoln<br />\nCenter last June.<br />\nProfessor Slusser noted that<br />\nVoznesensky had been rather quiet<br />\nduring the past few months, much<br />\nbolder challenges having been<br />\nmade by numerous others. He<br />\nspeculated that during the recent<br />\ntrials of literary rebels, however,<br />\nVoznesensky had become involved<br />\nin protest, thereby bringing greater<br />\npressure against him.<br />\nMr. Voznesensky's agents said<br />\nthat he hoped he would be able to<br />\nmake the tour next September or<br />\nOctober, at the start of the year.<br /><br />\n\u00f8te petionmace oniv<br /><br />\nCIVIC CENTER, Sun, Feb, 18, 8 P.M,<br />\nTreat Yourself to an Evening of Total Entertainment<br /><br />\n* Correspondence<br />\nHULLAVA YEARBOOK<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI hope that this letter is printed<br />\nbecause I believe that it expresses<br />\nnot only my own opinion but also<br />\nthe views of many who graduated<br />\nwith me from Hopkins. I recently<br />\nreceived a piece of trash which<br />\nwas passed off as the 1967 issue of<br />\nthe Hullabaloo. I have seen good<br />\nyearbooks and poor ones but never<br />\nhave I come across a college annual<br />\nsuch as this. I can't use the adjectives that I would like in describing this \"yearbook\" because<br />\nthey are unprintable. Instead of<br />\nboldly displaying their names<br />\nthroughout the pages of the book,<br />\nit seems that the editors of Hullabaloo \u2014 1967 should instead have<br />\nbeen ashamed to even have put<br />\ntheir names into print for having<br />\nproduced such a gross monstrosity<br />\nMost of the 1967 Hullabaloo<br />\nstaff have already left the Hop.<br />\nAll is not lost, however, for those<br />\nremaining ought immediately to<br />\nbe taken out and shot before they<br />\ncan produce another piece of rot.<br />\nStuart H. Dorfman<br />\nClass of'67<br />\nHULLAVA RESPONSE<br />\nEditors' Note: The following response has been offered in rebuttal<br />\nto the several criticisms directed<br />\nagainst this year's Hullabaloo.<br />\nYou know,or you should know<br />\nif you have ever really looked,<br />\nthat yearbooks are remarkably<br />\nbland publications. Traditionally<br />\nthey are asexual, unemotional,<br />\nand (almost as a point of honor, if<br />\nnot consistency)superficial. If you<br />\nwould care to look into the embarrassing history of yearbooks<br />\nboth here at Hopkins and at other<br />\nuniversities, there are in the Barn<br />\ndecades of yearbooks which, except for the title pages, are virtually indistinguishable. They<br />\nspeak of nothing in particular;t<br />\nthey speak to no one in particular.<br />\nExcept for changes in . style of<br />\ndress, they all could have come<br />\nout of the same time and place.<br />\nThe notable exceptions among the<br />\nHullabaloos are at the turn of the<br />\ncentury, when they had a distinct<br />\ncharacter \u2014 a beautifully naive optimism about the future \u2014 and in<br />\n1964 \u2014 when Lehman and Drell<br />\ntried their hands at self-concious<br />\nmedia manipulation. The 1967<br />\nHullabaloo.also is an exception.<br />\nWe thought it justifiable (if we<br />\nshould be called to justify it) but<br />\neven more, valuable, to make the<br />\n1967 Hullabaloo a book, a real<br />\nbook, that had a subjective point<br />\nof view, that could be read, alone,<br />\nnow or thirty years from now,<br />\nwith the feeling that something intangible \u2014 something of what Hopkins was for us in 1967, and what<br />\nit has meant for us to be here four<br />\nyears \u2014 had been captured. It was<br />\nintended to do this in an individual<br />\nway, so that if we were successful<br />\nyou would find something of yourself on the pages.<br /><br />\nIn one series, the consecutive shots<br />\nof a boy and his dog are so deftly<br />\napposed that the characters actually seem to move if you flip<br />\nthe pages fast enough.

The<br />\ngentle art of subtlety so skillfully<br />\npracticed by Europeans is all but<br />\nlost in the clumsy hands of Nichols.

With the production of a<br />\nmajor documentary nearly completed by students here, yesterday's<br />\nfaint hopes for a film department at Hopkins seems a little more<br />\nrealistic.<br />\nIt is with the hope that the News-Letter devotes a major part of<br />\nthis issue to the subject of filmmaking at Hopkins, to the students<br />\nwho are working on films and to the philosophical and educational<br />\njustifications for a unversity sponsored film department.<br />\nThe following article appeared in the News-Letter last year, and<br />\nwe offer it again in hopes that it will be better read and more accepted this time<br />\nFilm, through television and the movies, has come to comprise an<br />\nimportant part of the modern environment. Social and political<br />\nviews, and life styles including many forms of aberrant behavior<br />\nhave been initiated and constantly tended to by the mass media.<br />\nFor any student born after 1945, a knowledge of the technology,<br />\nartistic principles, and artistic history of the mass media will be an<br />\ninvaluable aid toward understanding his environment. For a humanities student or a social scientist, the ability to decipher the strange<br />\nways of the media and what they tell us about our society will indispensable for creative social contribution. In addition to equipping<br />\nscholars'and educating citizens, film study in the university opens a<br />\nnew avenue of expression.<br />\nAnother need that has been articulated is that the university must<br />\nplay a role in the community and cast off its ivory tower aloofness.<br />\nRecently almost every public figure has at one convocation or another<br />\nsaid that the university, its faculty and its students, must recognize<br />\nand accept new and challenging social realities, that it must not forsake the community for esoteric research. Scholarship must assume<br />\na new role; one likely form for this committment to take is film production because film is at present the most universal educational<br />\nmedium. Could not the u\u201diversity extend its function best by producing films which explore important areas of social change?<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is not and never will be a trades school.<br />\nIts film department could never reach the proportions of a school<br />\nlike U.S.C. whose money comes from the movie industry, whose<br />\nstudents learn industry techniques and ultimately join the industry<br />\nafter they graduate. Its function is terminal.<br />\nHopkins on the other hand would use film to further a student's<br />\nexploration of his environment, to develop a critical sense toward<br />\na medium that continues to grow. When you consider that last year<br />\nthere were more films produced than books written, you begin to see<br />\nhow valuable a knowledge of film may be in the future. Film at Hopkins,giving the student a deeper understanding of the world he lives<br />\nin, would be instrumental in approach. The problems of the Cinemascope screen, though very real to a student at U.S.C. would never<br />\nconcern us here. Students here will be more concerned with content<br />\nand treatment.<br />\nThe issue of whether a film program should be included<br />\nin the<br />\nUniversity curriculum is a very real one and it has to do<br />\nwith the<br />\nsurvival of Liberal Arts education. The world is changing<br />\nrapidly and<br />\nfilm is intimately tied to its development. If Hopkins is to<br />\nmeet its<br />\ncommittment to this pressing reality \u2014 at least one of the<br />\nways it<br />\ncould do so is by initiating a program in film study.<br /><br />\nMemories Are Made of This<br />\nA yearbook may be the most abused art form currentl<br />\ny in existence.

But<br />\nmemory exists in a<br />\nworld all its own. It exists largely in little snapshot<br />\ns you carry in your<br />\ncranium.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo this year has done what a yearbook<br />\nshould do; it<br />\nhas captured memory. A picture of ,Pecora'<br />\ns, a guy sitting in his<br />\nkitchen with a spoon in his hand watching the<br />\na picture of a dorm bathroom. Every picture Friday Night Movies,<br />\ntells a story.

Then he called up a<br />\nfew musician friends like Ravi<br />\nand Ornette to write a little something. Then he traveled to India,<br />\nMontana, New York, the California Redwoods, Mexico,and France<br />\nfor three years making the movie<br />\nand dispensing with somethinr<br />\nnear $1,000,000 (which shouid<br />\nmake Chappaqua the most expensive Underground flick yet).<br /><br />\nThe credit for the movie as it<br />\nstands must be given to the film<br />\neditor, Kenout Peltier, and the<br />\ncameraman, Robert Frank (Pull<br />\nMy Daisy). From all appearances,<br />\nthe film's Ramparts slickness was<br />\ncreated in the cutting room. The<br />\nphotography is easily the highpoint<br />\nof the movie. There is an effective<br />\nhit-and-miss cohesion in the techniques employed. The plot line is<br />\ncarried by various shades of nitty<br />\ngritty black and white, with flashbacks to hallucinations in color,<br />\nmuted filters, and sepia. The effects are interesting, beautiful,<br />\neven worth watching. But any<br />\nGestalt evaluation turns out negative at the end of the movie.<br />\nWe have to go under the assumption that Rooks produced a<br />\nmovie, not an \"experiment\". In<br />\nthis movie, dialogue and acting is<br />\nlacking. The dialogue is self-consciously extemporaneous where it<br />\nshould have been direct and sparing. Jean-Louis Barrault looked<br />\nembarrassed about the whole affect. (Our hero is attempting a<br /><br />\ndrug cure. He sees himself skating<br />\nby. \"Get away, hallucinations.\"<br />\nOh, Really?)<br />\nLet's examine this idea of movie<br />\nversus experiment a bit closer.

If Chappaqua<br />\nwas made in this spirit, then it is a<br />\nsmashing success, it is non-communicative.

This year the members of the<br />\nWorkshop encountered a number of fortuitous circumstances. First, in the last three years there has<br />\nbeen a growing interest in film among members of the<br />\nHopkins Community. A number of qualified students<br />\nwere willing to devote an almost unlimited amount<br />\nof time and effort towards the production of a film.<br />\nSecondly, the Department of Social Relations in conjunction with the Center for the Study of the Social<br />\nOrganization of Schools was interested in publicizing<br />\na project on game simulations<br />\nan educational device which they had been researching for several<br />\nyears. As a part of a grant from the Carnegie Foundation the Social Relations department had allotted<br />\n$2,000 to study the possibilities of using a film as a<br />\nmeans of disseminating information about their games.<br />\nThe members of the Film Workshop felt that perhaps<br /><br />\nHOPKINS<br />\nit would be more beneficial in the long run to actually<br />\nmake a film for the $2,000. The Social Relations department agreed.<br />\nInvolved in the original conception of the film were<br />\nthree expierenced Hopkins film makers active in the<br />\nFilm Workshop for the last three years: Carl Chatzky,<br />\nKen Locker and Jamil Simon. Carl Chatzky has been<br />\ninvolved with the university in one capacity or another<br />\nfor the past fourteen years. He has produced a number of experimental films and was one of the original<br />\nmotivating forces in film at Hopkins. Ken Locker, a<br />\nsenior majoring in Humanities, has gained intensive<br />\nprofessional experience in the last year. This past summer he filmed and directed a fifteen minute documentary film for VISTA which was shown nationally on<br />\neducational television this fall. Jamil Simon is a senior<br />\nmajoring in Art History and an experienced still photographer. This summer he worked as a film editor in a<br />\nLondon film studio.<br />\nThe opportunity for a group of students to work<br />\nas .an independent group for an academic department<br />\n'5 indeed unique at Hopkins.

Secondly there is the contrast of situations which arise in the<br />\ngames contrasted against analagous situations which<br />\narise in real life. Within this basic structure we also<br />\nwanted to show graduate students and faculty members at Hopkins developing the games,and perhaps the<br />\nreactions of teachers using the games in the classroom.<br />\nWe decided to approach the film as a documentary<br />\nshooting in synchronized sound. In order to rent two<br />\nblimped and synced cameras and an interlock tape recorder the cost came to $100 a day. At this cost, we<br />\nwere able to rent the equipment for a week. Tom<br />\nBray, audio consultant for Barton Hall, agreed to do<br />\nthe sound recording for a nominal fee and to let us<br />\nuse additional microphones and mixers for no charge.<br />\nIn order for us to complete our shooting in this<br /><br />\nFILM<br />\nlimited period of time it was necessary to compromise<br />\nour original documentary approach and work from a<br />\ntightly organized shooting script. We decided to divide<br />\nour shooting into four parts: the graduate students<br />\ndeveloping the game, the students playing the game, a<br />\ntraditional classroom situation and the real life situations reflected in the game.<br />\nAfter many revisions we finally came up with a<br />\ncoherent shooting script. We found that a large part of<br />\nthe success of the film depended upon finding the<br />\nproper group of students to play the game. We were<br />\nfortunate in being able to arrange with John Roemer<br />\nof the Baltimore Friends School to use his eleventh<br />\ngrade history class. In order to maximize the usage<br />\nof the rented equipment we decided to have several<br />\npractice sessions with the Friends School students.<br />\nPrior to our final shooting in the Clipper room of<br />\nShriver Hall we found that in spite of its excellent<br />\nlighting, the acoustical properties made its use impossible. This turned out to be one of the major problems<br />\nwe faced during the entire filming: finding rooms<br />\nwhich were acoustical so that we could record intelligible conversations with moderate ambient background noise.<br />\nOur second major problem, especially with the<br />\nhigh school students, was to obtain dialogue that didn't<br />\nsound unnatural or unduly stilted. In order to overcome this problem we again had to compromise certain aspects of our script. We found that in order to<br />\nmaximize the spontanaity of the dialogue we. were<br />\nforced to abandon a strict script with a precise and<br />\npreplanned dialogue. In effect our shooting sessions<br />\nturned out to be small waiting games. The sound<br />\ncameraman was sitting in a wheel chair with the camera assistant waiting behind him poised and ready to<br />\nmove at the director's signal. Tom Bray devised a<br />\nrather unique communications system between the<br />\ncameraman,director and soundinan. The director(Carll<br />\nChatzky, the cameramen (Ken Locker and Jamil Simon)and the soundmen(Tom Bray and Fred Portnoy)<br />\nwere all able to listen to the sound as it was being recorded; the director, through the use of a small micorphone was able to talk to the camera man, telling<br />\nhim when and where to shoot, and to his sound man,<br />\ntelling him which microphone to fade in and out on.<br />\nAll of this could be done without disturbing the actual playing of the game without distracting conversations among the technical crew.<br />\nOther everpresent problems were the incompatibility of electric current available at the shooting locations and the amount of additional light we would<br />\nhave to provide. Jim Barber and Joel Crawford handled the electrical and lighting problems, in some instances having to use 15,000 watts of light and finding<br />\nthe necessary current.<br /><br />\nThe Reel World<br />\nof Johns Hopkins<br />\nThe Film Workshop has evolved over the last three<br />\nyears from a group of students with little more than<br />\ntheir intense interest in film-making and their ideas to<br />\na full fledged course with camera equipment, some<br />\nmoney and a place to work.<br />\nThere were several breaks to account for the<br />\nchange. The first was recognition and financial support from the Student Activities Commission. The<br />\nsecond was a room to work in Levering Hall contributed by Dr. Wickwire and beautifully outfitted with<br />\nlights and outlets by Mr. Sciven, the head electrician<br />\nand Mr. Peach, the plant manager.The third break was<br />\nsome editing equipment contributed by Ken Locker<br />\nand the fourth was the enthusiastic committment of<br />\nthe students enrolled in the course.<br />\nWhile Ken Locker and Jamil Simon were planning<br />\nthe film for the Social Relations Department, the students were making their first short films.

Hopkins' Dr.<br />\nJames Coleman, Professor of Social Relations, has been a leader<br />\nin \"simulated-environment\" researchers received a $200,000<br />\ngrant from the Carnegie Foundation in 1962.<br />\nDr. Coleman refers to this learning tool as \"using highly structured<br />\ngames for learning at all levels of<br />\neducation and for learning in a<br />\nwide variety of environments.\"<br />\nStudents playing the game, thus,<br />\n\"learn not by formal teaching, but<br />\nby acting in an environment created by the rules of the game.\"<br />\nThe games \"are designed to extract from the complex world of<br />\nreality a particular fragment of the<br />\nenvironment,\" he adds.\"The player then finds himself coping with<br />\nthat fragment.\"<br />\nFor example, in playing a democracy game, students learn how<br />\nthe system of representative democracy functions by acting out<br />\nthe role of a legislator. They better<br />\nunderstand the complexity of<br />\ngovernment and the role of a legislator in that fragment of their<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nMost of the simulated-environment games which have been constructed are in the field of the Social Sciences.. Besides the democracy game, there is an international simulation game, a consumer economics game, a life career<br />\ngame, a game simulating the conditions of England during the Industrial Revolution, a parent-child<br />\ngame,a community action game, a<br />\npropaganda game, an economic<br />\nsystem game and others.<br />\nChildren often achieve more<br />\n\"learning in an environment\" than<br />\nthey do with formal teaching. Dr.<br />\nColeman cites the learning of a language as an example of learning in<br />\nan environment. He adds that<br />\nmany children who learn something as complex as language while<br />\nin an environment may have trouble learning much simpler things<br />\nwhile in school. \"The cause may<br />\nwell be,\" he states, \"that being<br />\ntaught in school is simply not as<br />\neffective fof learning as are the<br />\nenvironments within which they<br />\nlearn to talk.\"<br />\nThe most striking result of the<br />\ngames in the classroom is motivation. No one has to push students<br />\ninto playing. More often, they<br />\npush reluctant teachers into letting them play.<br />\nAnother major problem in the<br />\nclassroom which the games may be<br />\nable to eliminate is that of the conflict between the teacher's role as<br />\nJudge and helper. In a normal situation, one of the teacher primary functions is to give marks.<br />\nDr. Coleman believes that \"As a<br />\nresult, students develop attitudes<br />\ntoward the teacher that can greatly interfer with learning: hostility,<br />\nservility, alienation . \"<br />\nBut simulated - environment<br />\ngames are self-judging. The player<br />\nknows he has won or lost by his<br />\nown actions. The teacher need no<br />\nlonger be the judge, but instead<br />\ncan serve as a helper to all of the<br />\nPlayers.<br />\nGames are particularly effective<br />\nfor the poorly motivated student.<br />\nOften this student develops negagive attitudes toward school and<br /><br />\n1,<br /><br />\ntends to think of himself as a failure. Dr. Coleman believes that the<br />\ngames help this student to abandon his negative attitude. Games<br />\nmay be the answer to the problems<br />\nof the inner-city schools. They<br />\nmay provide the tools and the<br />\nmotivation to make school a vital<br />\npart of the ghetto children's lives.<br />\nMoreover, games are effective<br />\nfor the gifted child who has become disillusioned with the system<br />\nbecause it offers him no opportunity for \"spectacular achievement.\" Games provide this opportunity and allow the student to<br />\ndevelop ideas of his own.<br />\nAt present, the simulation games are used mainly in tests and<br />\nexperimentation. Most of the testing takes place in Baltimore<br />\nschools, but schools from Florida<br />\nto California are trying out the<br />\ngames. Currently, the Hopkins research group is swamped with<br />\nmore requests than it can handle<br />\nfrom schools that want to institute the games in their curriculum.<br /><br />\nOver 400 French and Japanese<br />\nuniversity scientists appealed to<br />\ntheir \"American colleagues\" to refuse to allow their universities to<br />\nbe used for military and secret research.<br />\nCiting the \"ethical and professional responsibilities\" of the world<br />\nscientific community to willingly<br />\nrefuse to permit their discoveries<br />\nto be utilized for destructive purposes, the foregin scholars indicated that a continuation of military<br />\nfunctions on American campuses<br />\nwould \"lead to the determination<br />\nof an ever-growing number of<br />\nworld scientists and universities to<br />\ninterrupt their relations\" with involved U.S. universities, endangering traditional scientific exchanges<br />\nand conferences among world<br />\nscholars.<br />\nAmong the 433 signers of the<br />\nstatement are Nobel Prize-winner<br />\nAlfred Kastler, Field Prize-winner<br />\nLaurent Schwartz, Shoichi Sakata,<br />\nNobel Prize in Physics, Shinichiro<br />\nTomonaga, Nobel Prize in Physics<br />\nand Hideki Yukawa, Nobel Prize<br />\nin Physics.<br /><br />\nThe statement especially designated university-based research<br />\nin chemical and biological warfare<br />\nand other techniques of warfare<br />\nagainst civilian populations as a<br />\n\"grave violation\" of professional<br />\nethics. The signers supported those<br />\nnumerous American scholars who<br />\nhave opposed the war in Vietnam.<br />\nThe declaration, which was initiated by a number of scholars including Prof. Laurent Schwartz of<br />\nthe University of Paris, is also a<br />\nresponse to the controversy over<br />\nmilitary and classified research<br />\nwhich has wracked so many American universities in the past two<br />\nyears. In fiscal 1967 the Defense<br />\nDepartment allocated $449 million in resealch contracts to American universities, and in the prior<br />\nyear over 40 universities held contracts for chemical warfare research.<br />\nIn the past year, however, such<br />\nschools as the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, New York University, and Minnesota have moved<br />\nto eliminate such research.<br /><br />\nwas examined. The plan was to discover the attitudes toward the<br />\nprogram and to analyze the effectiveness of the practice of family<br />\nplanning. The finding of these<br />\npilot plans led to recommendations incorporated in the present<br />\nnationwide plan for population<br />\ncontrol in West Pakistan.<br />\nThe new program, begun two<br />\nyears ago, is a series of studies<br />\naimed at evaluating the current<br />\nfamily planning program.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nComplete, Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\nRUFF DRY &amp; FOLD<br />\nSHIRTS\u2014DRY CLEANING<br /><br />\nWaverly Laundromat<br />\n3330 GREENMOUNT AVE..<br />\n457-2121<br /><br />\nSystems are<br />\neveryone's<br />\nbusiness at<br />\nSanders<br />\nThat means you can prove yourself sooner here<br />\nAt Sanders, what you are is as important as what you can do \u2014<br />\nwhat you contribute to the development of new systems.

Of the four<br />\nJay league games remaining, one<br />\n(Dickinson) can be rated a safe<br />\nwin, and another (Western Maryland) a tossup: the back-to-back<br />\nDrexel and Ursinus clashes should<br />\nthus make or break the Homewood hoop season, and the former's psychological impact on the<br />\nlatter might be significant.<br />\nDrexel, which recently lost<br />\nHead Coach Sam Couzen for medical reasons, is 10-3 overall thus far<br />\nand possesses the same characteristics \u2014 size, defense, and depth,<br />\nwhich was most important to its<br />\nwinners of past years. The Dragon<br />\nstarting lineup, featuring four lettermen, averages 6-3; it has scored<br />\nat a 69.6 clip while allowing a game<br />\naverage of 64.2 (Hopkins: 75.1);<br />\nand has at least five reserves who<br />\nhave seen substantial game action.<br />\nDrexel's top individual performer<br />\nis 6-5 Senior center Jack Linderman, who after twelve games was<br />\naveraging 20.3 points and 15.0 rebounds per contest.<br />\nHopkins'last two M.A.C. losses,<br />\nof which Ciccarone was \"realistically hoping to win one\", were, in<br />\nthe varsity mentor's words, \"especially disappointing as regards<br />\nour defensive work and rebounding.\" The team allowed an average<br />\nof 86 points in those contests, let<br />\nits opponents shoot at a combined<br />\n44% floor rate; and, was outrebounded 63-43 by F&amp;M's sizable<br />\nsquad by 56-44 by a much smaller<br />\nMuhlenburg group.<br /><br />\nAlso factors in the losses were<br />\nso-so team shooting (37% for the<br />\ntwo games), good opposition performances,a rash of injuries, and a<br />\nnot-inconsiderable amount of bad<br />\nluck: the latLer two deserve further mention. Soph forward Geoff<br />\nThomas was sidelined for both<br />\ngames with a sprained ankle, Jim<br />\nCalli hobbled by a Charley Horse<br />\nin his thigh, and Mike Sullivan and<br />\nRich Thielke bothered by wrist<br />\nsprains.<br />\nThe \"luck\" factor assumed importance against F&amp;M,where Hopkins, down 40-34 at the half and<br />\n66-52 with ten minutes left, closed<br />\nto within three by 4:05. With<br />\nabout 3:30 remaining, Sullivan<br />\nwas sprung open on a fast break,<br />\nbut upon a \"block\" of his attempted layup, F&amp;M quickly capitalized<br />\non a three-point play to turn a<br />\npossible one-point Jay deficit into<br />\na six-counter Diplomat edge<br />\n\"From the standpoints of team<br />\nmomentum and the final margin,\"<br />\ncommented Ciccarone, that shot<br />\nstop by F&amp;M was the key play of<br />\nthe game.\" It was very likely also<br />\ngoal-tending.

The rules<br />\nstate that the home team must<br />\nprovide visual lap counters or forfeit the points in that event.<br />\nFor some reason, known only<br />\nto the upper echelon of the athletic department, the swimming<br />\nteam has yet to be given such<br />\ncounters. Although swimming is<br />\nsupposedly a dignified sport, the<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins wrestling team<br />\nbattles Ursinus tomorrow evening<br />\nat 8:00 p.m. with hopes of improving their shaky 3-3 record after<br />\nungracefully handing Western<br />\nMaryland a gift victory last Wednesday evening. The Baby Jays<br />\nwill be meeting the Ursinus J.V.<br />\nat 6:45 p.m.<br />\nThe final score of the Western<br />\nMd. match was 21-17; but the respectibility of the score in no way<br />\nexpresses the actual happenings on<br />\nthe mat.<br />\nDick Dryden, the 123 lb. Blue<br />\nJay, entered the match undefeated. Late in the third period with<br />\nDryden down by a 6-4 score, but<br />\nneeding only a takedown to win<br />\nbecause of riding time, a fluke<br />\ninjury occured and Dick badly<br />\ninjured his right elbow. Fowler of<br />\nWestern Maryland was given the<br />\nwin by default; but even worse<br />\nwas the fact that Dryden may now<br />\nbe lost until tournament time.<br />\nThere is no one on the varsity<br />\nto fill in at the 123 lb. class; and<br />\nin addition, the grapplers were \u2022<br />\nforced to forfeit at 130 lb. because<br />\nGreg Evans could not make weight.<br />\nCharles Coker continued his winning ways at 137 lb. by decisioning<br />\nMeyers, 16-4.<br />\nBill LaCorte, wrestling in his<br />\nfirst varsity match at 145 lb.,<br />\nshowed signs that he wished he<br />\nwasn't out there. LaCorte was almost disqualified for stalling, but<br />\nsaved himself from the humiliation<br />\nwhen he was pinned by Terry<br />\nConover(third in the M-D tourney<br />\nlast year) at 7:15 of the match.<br />\nHarry Gotwals (152 lb.) lost to<br />\nBlake of Western Maryland, 10-5.<br />\nGotwals made a bad mistake and<br />\npaid dearly when his opponent<br />\npancaked him and got a near fall.<br />\nJack Hanemann wrestled a very<br />\nlethargic match against Rick<br />\nSmertzler, (3rd in the M-D last<br />\nyear) and barely got away with<br />\nhis life. He lost by the score of<br />\n12-2. The team score now stood<br />\nat 21-3.<br />\nBill Swartz decisioned Star at<br />\n167 lb., 13-2; while John Peck<br />\npulled a win out in the last 20 seconds to defeat his Western Maryland opponent, 3-1. By this time<br />\nit was too late for the Jays; at 191<br />\nlb., Western Maryland's Herb<br />\nShrieves battled Hopkins' Bob<br />\nHyams.<br /><br />\nVALENTINE<br />\nCARDS<br />\nAND,<br />\nCANDY HEARTS<br />\nGreenway Pharmacy<br /><br />\nDrexel coach was perfectly justified in using whatever legal means<br />\npossible to win. Had the Jays lost<br />\nthe meet on this technicality, all<br />\nhell would have broken loose. But<br />\nthe 400 yd freestyle relay (Weikel,<br />\nBonnet, Henry,Burnham)clinched<br />\nthe meet with a varsity record<br />\ntime of 3:37.<br /><br />\nThe Penn State meet shortened<br />\nintersession by two days, but any<br />\nhostilities built up against the<br />\nschedule were taken out on the<br />\nNittany Lions at University Park.<br />\nLed by Rick Wilson's sweep of<br />\nboth the three meter and one<br />\nmeter diving events, and the 400<br />\nyd medley relay team (Fisher,<br />\nWare,Chernick, Burnham)the Jays<br />\nwere never headed and clinched<br />\nthe victory before the final two<br />\nevents.<br />\nGeorgetown proved a pleasant<br />\ndiversion for the Jays. Once again<br />\nHopkins opened the card with<br />\nseven quick points in the medley<br />\nrelay,won all but one event and<br />\nupped their Homewood pool record to a perfect 3-0.<br /><br />\nWith the season more than half<br />\nover, it might be a good idea to<br />\ntake stock of the team. While the<br />\nsuccess of the squad is welcomed<br />\nand hailed, it is also evident that<br />\nthe full potential of the team has<br />\nyet to be reached. With the exception of the 200 yd breaststroke<br />\nthe Jays can enter competent<br />\nswimmers in all events and field a<br />\nformidable medley and freestyle<br />\nevents,there is no real depth.<br /><br />\nThis can be primarily attributed<br />\nto lack of numbers, since the varsity squad carries only ten swimmers and two divers, but part of<br />\nthe reason can also be found in<br />\nthe fact that a second backstroker,<br />\nbutterflier and two breaststrokers<br />\nhave yet to be developed. A team<br />\nthat advertises for swimmers without previous experience but with<br />\ninterest only, must be held responsible for developing those inexperienced swimmers in events in<br />\nwhich the team is weak. Yet, this<br />\nhas been the failure of the Hopkins team. The leading point scorers, Chernick, Fisher, Weikel, all<br /><br />\ncame to Hopkins with previous experience and training. Likewise the<br />\nFreshman squad is headed by high<br />\nschool lettermen.<br />\nIt would be unfair to assume<br />\nthat the development of a swimmer from a novice to a medalist is<br />\neither a quick or easy task. However over a period of four years<br />\nonly co-captain Al Henry has<br />\nshown the vast improvement that<br />\ncan come with training. The stiff<br />\nworkouts that highlighted inter-<br /><br />\nsession practices are the type needed to produce strength and stamina. Yet equally important is the<br />\ninculcation of stroke technique in<br />\nthe butterfly, backstroke, and<br />\nbreaststroke. Admittedly it is far<br />\neasier to coach freestylers, since<br />\nmost people learn to swim the<br />\ncrawl stroke first, but until the<br />\nteam can build up depth in all<br />\nstrokes, Hopkins will not have the<br />\ntop notch squad its potential<br />\nwarrants.<br /><br />\nDo you think<br />\na bright young engineer<br />\nshould spend<br />\nhis most imaginative years on<br />\nthe same assignment?<br />\nNeither do we.<br />\nThat's why we have a twoyear Rotation Program for<br />\ngraduating engineers who<br />\nwould prefer to explore several<br />\ntechnical areas.
