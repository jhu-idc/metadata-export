Ile cannot, now, be a<br />\nlegitimate member of the Hopkins political community.<br />\n<br />\nOf Cabbages and Kings<br />\nIt has been the policy of the New.4-1441er in recent years to regard the Student Council as an atrophied<br />\nlimb of the student body, a condition which might be<br />\nbest overcome by painless amputation. Failing in just<br />\nsuch an effort some three years ago, we have sat back<br />\nand watched the Council continue to function spasmodically and ineffectually, with annual presidential<br />\nelections providing no cure by which life and purposive<br />\nactivity might be restored.<br />\nThis year, however, a possibility for rejuvenation<br />\nexists. Bill Reinseh has accurately diagnosed the cause<br />\nof the Council's impotence as being the lethargy of its<br />\nmembers and their failure to employ novel and unusual<br />\napproaches in dealing with student affairs. Beinsch's<br />\nplan for the \"exertion of positive pressure on the administration\" through \"orderly and organized student<br />\naction\" exemplifies the type of attitude which the (ouncil must adopt if it ever hopes to attract student support<br />\nanti become a leader of student opinion on campus.<br />\nJim Mongiardo, Reinsch's opponent, remains mired<br />\nin the muck of precedent. His platform expresses the<br />\ntraditional disappointment in the Council's failure to<br />\nlive up to its \"tremendous potential as a positive representative body,\" and yet it can only attribute this situation to a lack of decorum at Council meetings. Focusing<br />\nexcessively on organization, he shows little awareness<br />\nof the problems currently confronting Hopkins undergraduates, while Beinsch enumerates several, presenting<br />\nin addition concrete means of action.<br />\nThe implications of today's vote are clear. Reinseh's<br />\nelection would reflect students' justifiable resentment<br />\nagainst administration neglect and their potential desire to more overtly demonstrate their feelings. The<br />\nelection of Mongiardo would indicate a mandate for the<br />\ncurrent policy of non-directional Council activity.
