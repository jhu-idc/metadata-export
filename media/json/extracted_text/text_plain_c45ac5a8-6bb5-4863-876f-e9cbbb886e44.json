Reprinted with permission.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Dean of Students<br />\nSusan Boswell, the University has<br />\ncreated an ad hoc committee to<br />\nexamine the role of the Reserve<br />\nOfficer Training Corps(ROTC)<br />\nat Hopkins, particularly its stated<br />\npolicy of excluding lesbians and<br />\nhomosexuals. The committee will<br />\nassess campus attitudes among<br />\nstudents, faculty, and staff, and<br />\ngather information from peer institutions, Boswell said.<br />\nExplaining why the committee<br />\nwas formed, Dean of Homewood<br />\nSchools and Services Chris Columbo cited a \"concern raised by<br />\nsome undergraduates.\" The committee represents a promise to<br />\nlook at the issue, he said.<br />\nPaul DelGrosso, president of<br />\nthe Hopkins Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance(GALA)and a member<br />\nof the new committee, thinks the<br />\nUniversity should apply its nondiscrimination policy in \"the true<br />\n<br />\nspirit of\" the clause; in other<br />\nwords, to all programs on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe clause states that the<br />\nUniversity \"does not discriminate<br />\non the basis of. . . homosexuality. . . in any program or activity,<br />\nincluding administration of its<br />\neducational policies. . .scholarship and loans programs. . .and<br />\nother University-administered<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\nHopkins Army ROTC Commanding Officer Lt. Colonel<br />\nRobert E. Jalette disagreed with<br />\nDelGrosso's reading of the<br />\nclause. \"The commissioning of<br />\nofficers into the United States Army is under the direction of the<br />\nDepartment of Defense,\" he explained. \"The program is<br />\nseparate from the University\"<br />\nand does not fall within the<br />\nUniversity's nondiscrimination<br />\nclause, he said.<br />\nJalette also stated that ROTC<br />\nfinancial aid falls under federal<br />\n<br />\ngovernment guidelines. \"A different set of criteria\" applies to<br />\ncadets receiving government<br />\nfinancial aid than those receiving<br />\naid from Hopkins, he said.<br />\nA spokesman for the Army<br />\nCadet Command at Fort Monroe,<br />\nVa., reiterated Jalette's point,<br />\nsaying that \"Army ROTC is<br />\ngoverned by the DOD and goes<br />\nby its directives.\"<br />\nDOD directive 1332.14, which<br />\nwas revised in January 1982, prohibits homosexuals from entering<br />\nany branch of the armed forces,<br />\naccording to Major Hart of the<br />\nDOD Information office.

A proposal was submitted to Student<br />\nCouncil President Bob Nelson as<br />\nwell as Dean Columbo, head of<br />\nHomewood Schools and Services<br />\nto re-establish a student radio station (WHOP) on campus.<br />\nThe initial set-up cost, according to the prospective radio station (WHOP) president Brian<br />\nLiddicoat, would be $12,500,<br />\nwith an extra $1,000 cost for each<br />\nadditional building that would<br />\ncarry the station. The station<br />\nwould be broadcast through a carrier current which would work<br />\nslightly differently than the<br />\ntypical FM frequency.<br />\nRadio transmitters would be<br />\nhooked up to a building's power<br />\n<br />\nAndy Barnert of WHOP.<br />\n<br />\ntransformer and the signal would<br />\nbe transferred through the electrical lines of the building. The<br />\nstation could be broadcast only in<br />\nthe buildings with the transmitters, since each building's electrical system would act as a giant<br />\nantenna but the insulation of the<br />\nwalls would prevent the electromagnetic current from leaving<br />\nthe building. This method,<br />\nassured Liddicoat, would not interfere with the electrical power<br />\nor phone lines of the buildings.<br />\nThe radio's managing board,<br />\nwhich includes General Manager<br />\nAndy Barnert, Programming<br />\nDirector Richard Schwartz,<br />\nBusiness Manager Mira Vayda<br />\nand Chief Engineer Adam Haberfield, in addition to Liddicoat,<br />\ndevised a plan that begins with<br />\nAMR I and II and Buildings A<br />\nand B, which means only people<br />\nin those buildings could hear the<br />\nbroadcast. They hope to expand<br />\nto Gilman and Levering and then<br />\ntake their broadcast off campus,<br />\ninto Wolman and McCoy, by<br />\nrunning the signal over phone<br />\nlines.<br />\nWith the permission of<br />\nlandlords, they hope to extend<br />\nWHOP to non-university owned<br />\napartments, but excluding the<br />\nsurrounding rowhouses. Andy<br />\nBarnert explained that installation<br />\nwould be impractical, costing approximately $680 to $1200 for<br />\neach additional rowhouse. He is<br />\nlooking at the possibility of expanding the station into cable FM<br />\nso all students with cable TV<br />\ncould receive the station.<br />\nThe plan is ambitious in light<br />\n<br />\nof Hopkins' uncertain past in the<br />\narea of communications. In the<br />\n1940's, students started to broadcast across the P.A. system in<br />\nLevering. In the 1960's, the station was transmitted on an AM<br />\ncarrier current with wiring in<br />\nAMR I and II. Only in 1979 did<br />\nstudents finally obtain an FCC<br />\nlicense and begin to broadcast on<br />\nan FM frequency\u2014WJHU 88.1<br />\nFM.<br />\nThe station was run from the<br />\nbasement of AMR II and later<br />\nmoved to the back of Lazear,<br />\nwhere the new radio crew hopes<br />\nto begin programming.<br />\nWhen the FCC passed a regulation invalidating 10 watt stations,<br />\nWJHU was forced to obtain a 100<br />\nwatt license and subsequently lost<br />\nmoney.

It involves relatively low<br />\noperational costs, averaging<br />\nabout $12,000 initially, as opposed to the $140,000 for installing a 100 watt station.

Students interested in going to medical school receive excellent<br />\npreparation in key areas. They also receive faculty and administrative support when applying, and<br />\nthey benefit from having many students of high<br />\nacademic ability with similar goals in their<br />\nprogram.<br />\nMost undergraduates who plan to go to medical<br />\nschool major in biology. The biology department<br />\nat Hopkins prepares students well for medical<br />\nschool by offering an especially strong background<br />\nin biochemistry and cellular biology. Hopkins<br />\nstudents have an extremely high acceptance rate<br />\nto medical school, and once there, they are very<br />\nsuccessful. These strengths attest to Hopkins' success as a pre-medical institution and offer benefits<br />\nto both individual students and the institution as<br />\na whole.<br />\nHopkins undergraduates also benefit from their<br />\ncontact with current research in biology. The size<br />\nand structure of the department allow students to<br />\nget involved with faculty members who are at the<br />\ntop of their fields. Students participate in and contribute to the work in progress within the department. They are a part of the process\u2014not just<br />\nobservers\u2014and as a result their education extends<br />\nbeyond the dimensions of classroom learning. They<br />\nare engaged in the material and the issues more<br />\nintimately, and at a higher level, than is possible<br />\nat most institutions.<br />\nThe attention of the faculty and administration,<br />\nthe specific strengths and emphasis of the department, and the unique opportunities in research<br />\nprepare students extremely well for medical school<br />\nor graduate work and research careers in biology.<br />\nBut the courses offered in the biology department<br />\nare limited in scope and cater only to students who<br />\nplan to work in these specific areas. Students interested in pursuing careers in the health professions who do not want to attend medical school cannot, in many cases, fulfill the prerequisites for a<br />\nprofessional program during their four years at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt is not reasonable to expect the biology department at a school of this size to be excellent in all<br />\nfields, or even to offer courses in every possible<br />\narea of interest. It is reasonable, however, to<br />\nassume that students interested in the health pro-<br />\n<br />\nfessions may come here intending to apply to<br />\nmedical school but later decide against it during<br />\na course of study. It should be possible for a student to make a logical, lateral move within a<br />\ngeneral course of study and be able to leave<br />\nHopkins prepared for his or her chosen professional<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThe strengths of the biology department here at<br />\nHopkins are unique and valuable, but they do not<br />\nserve as excuse nor explanation for the lack of options available to students interested in other health<br />\nprofesions or in an alternative in biology. With attention to the needs of these students, a few courses<br />\ncould be added to the curriculum. These courses<br />\nwould address the needs of atypical Hopkins<br />\nbiology students specifically, but they would also<br />\nserve as valuable options for other biology students<br />\nand the rest of the University population. Though<br />\nnot required for entrance to medical school, the<br />\ncourses would still be of interest to many and highly<br />\nrelevant to the field. They would also offer greater<br />\nchoices to students who are interested in basic<br />\nnatural science courses but who do not have the<br />\nbackground in chemistry to take most of the biology<br />\ncourses in the current curriculum.<br />\nFilling the gaps would not place unreasonable<br />\nfinancial or teaching demands on the department.<br />\nIt would in no way detract from the strengths of<br />\nHopkins, but it would more closely align the curriculum with those of Hopkins' peer institutions,<br />\nand it would directly serve the academic needs and<br />\ninterests of Hopkins undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nFew aspects of the University come under such<br />\nconsistent criticism as Campus Security. Students<br />\nat Hopkins absorb the evolving canon of Security<br />\njokes far more readily than they absorb the fundamentals of any 100-level lecture class. And<br />\nwhat's the surprise in that? Hopkins Security Police<br />\ncan often seem like dull, bloated caricatures of<br />\n\"real police.\" They harass students. They do<br />\nnothing but tool around campus in their oversized<br />\nsedans and eat doughnuts. The emergency<br />\ntelephones that dot the campus connect directly to<br />\nthe AMR II snack bar\u2014or so the jokes inform us.<br />\nBut what's the issue behind the jokes?<br />\nNext Week in Editorial<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nTwo Letters on Behalf of ROTC; Beneath Every Renovated<br />\nUniversity Building Is a Water Lining and Temporary Carpet<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n<br />\nLast week's article, \"Send<br />\nHopkins ROTC Packing\" was, in<br />\na word, disturbing. Apparently,<br />\nPaul Delgrosso and the rest of the<br />\nGay and Lesbian Alliance do not<br />\nrealize the importance of ROTC<br />\nunits in this country.

This suggests that these<br />\ncourses are not worth very much<br />\nin the eyes of the administration.<br />\nPerhaps a little history is in<br />\norder. The art program at<br />\nHomewood began in the fall of<br />\n1974, on the initiative of(can you<br />\nbelieve it?) then-President Steven<br />\nMuller. Eugene Leake had just<br />\nretired as President of Maryland<br />\nInstitute/College of Art(MICA),<br />\nand Muller invited him to be the<br />\nfirst artist in residence at<br />\nHopkins. Leake originally taught<br />\nonly one day a week but had increased his workload by around<br />\n1980. At that time he wanted to<br />\nconcentrate more on his own<br />\npainting, so Craig Hankin was<br />\nhired.<br />\nStudent interest was strong at<br />\nthe beginning of each semester,<br />\nbut people often dropped out of<br />\nthe non-credit classes around<br />\nmid-term, probably due to increased accredited academic<br />\nwork. With the help of then-Dean<br />\nof Students Chris Columbo, the<br />\ncourses were granted one credit.<br />\nThis halted the mid-semester<br />\ndrop-off, and the classes have<br />\nalways been filled since. Clearly, the difference between a onecredit course and a no-credit<br />\ncourse is significant.<br />\nThis year two new classes are<br />\nbeing offered. Currently, Cartooning is taught by Baltimore<br />\ncartoonist Tom Chalkley. In the<br />\nspring Two-dimensional Design<br />\nwill be offered.

The<br />\nHumanities Center intervened,<br />\nand the courses are now offered<br />\nwith its official sponsorship.<br />\nSurprisingly, the studio program has no relationship with the<br />\nDepartment of Art History. This<br />\nis in keeping with the Germanic<br />\ntradition Hopkins venerates, but<br />\n<br />\nWhy Johns Hopkins<br />\ntreats the fine arts<br />\nas a 'soft'<br />\nmental activity<br />\n<br />\nin contrast to such \"peer institutions\" as Yale or Cornell,<br />\nwhere the art history departments<br />\nare coupled with a fine arts studio<br />\nprogram, forcing students to participate in the creative process to<br />\nbetter understand it.<br />\nWhy does the University treat<br />\nthe fine arts so shabbily? According to Associate Dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences Michael Beer, the<br />\nart program differs in that all<br />\nother subjects have home departments, and without that structure<br />\nin place, \"they\" have no way of<br />\nmonitoring the program or instructors. Beer's reliance on nonreferential pronouns clouds the<br />\nsubject. When questioned about<br />\nwho he meant with all of his we's<br />\nand they's he said, \"Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" (Surely not the<br />\nfounder?)<br />\nClearly he means the administrators, who keep the trust<br />\nof the University. Never before<br />\nhas an administrator admitted that<br />\nhe doesn't know how things<br />\nwork. Beer asserts that fine arts<br />\nare outside the purview that is<br />\nJohns Hopkins and therefore giving full credits to courses where<br />\nthe University has no experience<br />\nwould be a betrayal of the high<br />\nstandards JHU trumpets. In other<br />\nwords, such a foray into the arts<br />\nwould undermine the University's \"credibility.\"<br />\nContinued on page 6<br />\n<br />\n-miNSMN/M<br />\n<br />\n116-alEhomME<br />\n<br />\n11\u202265\u20221=11..._<br />\n<br />\n\f6/SEPTEMBER 28, 1990<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from page 5<br />\nkitchens, bathrooms,<br />\nin<br />\nbedrooms and hallways.

On the other hand,<br />\nmany of the paintings and<br />\nphotographs are beautiful. But<br />\nwhat unites these works is the<br />\nfeeling they collectively express<br />\nabout our society, a malaise or<br />\ndiscontent with the way we currently are.<br />\nOne such work, Thomas<br />\nSegars' \"Patriot,\" depicts a man<br />\nwhose eyes are blindfolded. The<br />\n<br />\nblindfold is an American flag.<br />\nThe painting was at one time<br />\nwithdrawn from an art show for<br />\nbeing \"inappropriate.\"<br />\n\"As I watched people scuffling<br />\nover burning flags,\" comments<br />\nSegar, \"I thought about how<br />\nmuch attention was being paid to<br />\nthe symbol, and that perhaps<br />\nmore attention should be paid to<br />\nthe idea that it's supposed to<br />\nrepresent. Phrases like 'wrapping<br />\nhimself in the flag' and 'blind<br />\n<br />\npatriotism' came to mind and the<br />\nimage of the blindfolded man<br />\npresented itself to me.

This was the disturbing part<br />\nto learn.\"<br />\nAnother censored painting is<br />\nMartin Palombo's \"The Magician.\" It depicts two men standing together, one dressed in a<br />\nmagician's tuxedo, the other<br />\ngarbed in white. The hair of the<br />\nman in white is painted as flames,<br />\nand on his shoulders rides a rabbit.

The scholarly nomenclature<br />\ngiven to his style of writing,<br />\nmagic realism, aptly describes the<br />\nauthor's work. He has the ability to establish a society that is eloquently depicted and order it to<br />\nthe point of fatalism. He then fills<br />\nthis world with absurdities, while<br />\nthe reader grips the pages with the<br />\nbelief and wonder of a child. But,<br />\nwhat have we here? A movie?<br />\nThe Fable of the Beautiful<br />\nPigeon Fancier tells the fated<br />\nstory of don Orestes(Ney Latorraca), a wealthy rum maker and<br />\nlover of other men's wives. It's<br />\na very simple plot: a typical Garcia Marquez tale about a man, his<br />\nlover, and a cuckold. (Nobody<br />\nwrites better cuckold stories.)<br />\nIt is Thursday, and, as on every<br />\nThursday, don Orestes goes into<br />\ntown to the barber's for a shave;<br />\nto the restaurant where he eats<br />\ncorvina; and to engage in<br />\n<br />\nadulterous activities with the<br />\nbarber's wife. Afterwards he<br />\nbrings his horse and carriage to<br />\nthe seashore where he first sees<br />\nFulvia (Claudia Chana), chasing<br />\nher white umbrella which has<br />\nbeen swept away by the wind and<br />\nleft floating in the water.<br />\nWhen she sends him a white<br />\nhoming pigeon, he is convinced<br />\nthat he is in love. \"That's funny,\" says his clairvoyant mother,<br />\n\"I dreamed I saw a red vulture.\"<br />\nThrough a series of messages sent<br />\nby the pigeon he tells her of his<br />\nlove for her, and when no reply<br />\ncomes he falls into depression,<br />\ndrinking his own rum, refusing to<br />\neat. Fulvia, aware of don Orestes'<br />\nscandalous history with women,<br />\nhesitates before she allows herself<br />\nto fall in love with the local don<br />\nJuan.<br />\nThe film tries and succeeds in<br />\nestablishing the same sort of<br />\nmood that the stories seem to take<br />\non the written page. However,<br />\ndirector Ruy Guerro, because of<br />\nthe medium, is forced to seek<br />\n<br />\nChEapn(Date&<br />\nFriday, 9/28<br />\nFor an encounter with the<br />\nsurreal, there's The Fable of<br />\nthe Beautiful Pigeon-Fancier<br />\nat the BMA at 8 PM (see<br />\nreview) And on campus, two<br />\nfilms make up the Gay and<br />\nLesbian Film Focus, 8 and 10<br />\nPM.

The Hopkins senior is<br />\na native of Jordan.<br />\nRaad is one of a handful of<br />\nHopkins students from Middle<br />\nEastern countries. Their perspectives on the invasion of Kuwait<br />\nand the U.S. military presence in<br />\nSaudi Arabia are largely shaped<br />\nby the fact that they are Arab or<br />\nIsraeli.<br />\nAt home in Jordan when<br />\nKuwait was invaded, Raad was<br />\nsurprised by the invasion. \"It was<br />\ntotally unexpected.\"<br />\nMaha Damaj, a Lebanese expatriate whose family lives in the<br />\nUnited Arab Emirates, recalls being scared when Kuwait was<br />\ninvaded.<br />\nDamaj believes that Saddam<br />\nHussein's invasion was an extreme reaction to failed talks with<br />\nKuwaiti leaders.<br />\n\"I think the solution to this problem was well within Arab<br />\nhands. I feel that if the U.S. had<br />\nnot intervened that there would<br />\nhave been a chance for an Arab<br />\n<br />\nsolution.\"<br />\nHowever, she, is glad that the<br />\nU.S. is there now to prevent Iraq<br />\nfrom doing anything more<br />\nextreme.<br />\nA Hopkins student who lived<br />\nin Israel for several years echoed<br />\nthis latter sentiment. \"I am glad<br />\nthe U.S. acted forcefully and<br />\nquickly.\" In his mind, the U.S.<br />\npresence sends a message to the<br />\nterrorist countries of the region<br />\nthat they cannot act in the manner which President Hussein has.<br />\nRaad and his nation support the<br />\nUnited Nations and the sanctions,<br />\nbut both the impact of the sanctions and the foreign intervention<br />\nworries him.<br />\nJordan supports the sanctions<br />\nbecause it believes that the invasion was wrong, but its economy<br />\nis suffering tremendously. Its<br />\neconomy is very closely tied to<br />\nIraq's. Before the invasion of<br />\nKuwait, forty percent of Jordanian economic activity directly<br />\ninvolved Iraq. As a result of the<br />\nsanctions, unemployment and inflation have started to rise, and<br />\nRaad fears unrest among the<br />\npeople.<br />\n<br />\n\"The Kuwaitis got the worst of<br />\nthe invasion, certainly, but Jordan is not far behind.\"<br />\nIn addition to the economic<br />\nproblems created by the sanctions, it is also difficult, politically, for the King of Jordan to oppose Saddam Hussein. Many of<br />\nRaad's countrymen see the Iraqi<br />\nPresident as a hero.<br />\nRaad believes that for many<br />\nJordanians, especially poorer<br />\nones, seeing the Iraqi leader defying the Western powers has<br />\nrekindled their feelings of resentment against the Western Imperialist powers who have oppressed them in the past.<br />\nBoth Raad and Damaj condemn<br />\nSaddam Hussein's actions, but<br />\nthey know that many of their<br />\nfellow Arabs do not.<br />\nDamaj believes that the Iraqi<br />\nleader's action, extreme though<br />\nit was, made many Arabs \"wake<br />\nup and smell the coffee. The invasion of Kuwait proved that the<br />\nArabs are a force to be reckoned<br />\nwith.\"<br />\nShe notes that the Palestinians<br />\nidentified with President Hussein<br />\nbecause they thought, short-<br />\n<br />\nsightedly, \"that here was someone who was willing to stand up<br />\nto the West. Maybe he could<br />\nsolve our problems.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins student from<br />\nIsrael agrees with this impression,<br />\nadding that \"the Palestinians see<br />\ntheir hopes tied in with Saddam<br />\nHussein because he tried to make<br />\nit an Arab-Israeli issue from the<br />\nbeginning.\"<br />\nHe believes that the antiAmericanism is on the rise in the<br />\nMiddle East, in no small part<br />\nbecause the U.S. is trying to stop<br />\nthe leader of Iraq.<br />\nRaad fears the rise of both antiAmericanism and Islamic Fundamentalism. He believes that if<br />\nthe U.S. acts militarily against<br />\nIraq that it will be like \"lighting<br />\na fuse\" under these two forces.<br />\nRaad is also concerned with the<br />\nlong-term implications of<br />\nWestern intervention in the Gulf.<br />\nHe and Damaj share the view that<br />\nsince the U.S. now has a foothold<br />\nin the region it will probably stay<br />\nthere.<br />\nThe U.S. presence in the area<br />\nraises a different concern for the<br />\nstudent from Israel. He hopes that<br />\n<br />\nFood for Thought: The Charles Village Pub<br />\nby Jessica Maxwell<br />\nHere's the scenario...You're in<br />\nthe MSE library on D-level<br />\ndesparately trying to understand<br />\nthe last two weeks of lecture notes<br />\nand your stomach growls. The<br />\nTerrace Room is closed. Home<br />\nmeans waiting for the shuttle and<br />\nhoping that you'll be able to make<br />\nit back to campus before day<br />\nbreaks. But there is light at the<br />\nend of the tunnel.<br />\nWalking distance (although if<br />\nit's late I wouldn't walk alone)<br />\nfrom the MSE is the Charles<br />\nVillage Pub. You've seen it<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nbefore, right next to Eddie's<br />\nGourmet Liquor Shop. At first<br />\nglance, it looks intimidating.<br />\nAfter all, you're looking for a bite<br />\nto eat, not a scotch on the rocks<br />\n(I hope). Go in, I think you'll like<br />\nit.<br />\nFor beginners, I recommend<br />\nMexican Potato Skins ($3.95).<br />\nFor \u2022an appetizer, these are<br />\nenough to split. Or if you're really not that hungry, you might<br />\nwant to try the Mexican Potato<br />\n($2.50) as an entree. Both are<br />\ngreat. They have just the right<br />\nmixture of spice and flavor. Of<br />\ncourse, if you're not really into<br />\n<br />\njalepenos on your skins, they'll<br />\nleave them off at your request.<br />\nThe sandwich/dinner menu offers a variety of things: there's the<br />\ntraditional Hopkins Club ($4.95)<br />\nwhich consists of roast beef,<br />\nswiss, onion, lettuce, tomato, and<br />\nmayo, the 4 oz. bacon<br />\ncheeseburger ($3.50), the BBQ<br />\nchicken breast ($5.50), and the<br />\nalluring Goucher Club ($4.95)<br />\nwhich is chicken salad, bacon,<br />\nlettuce, tomato, and mayo. Or if<br />\nyou want something a little<br />\nlighter, they also have a few<br />\nsalads, notably a nice spinach<br />\nsalad ($3.50). All the sandwiches<br />\n<br />\nare served with chips and dip; this<br />\nis a refreshing change if you don't<br />\nlike french fries.<br />\nThe Charles Village Pub decor<br />\nis dominated by sports photos;<br />\nfrom baseball to horse racing,<br />\neven bobsledding. It is well lit,<br />\nyet not too bright. Surprisingly,<br />\neven real people frequent it (as<br />\nopposed to only students). If<br />\nyou're of age (which if you're<br />\nnot, taking your fake i.d. is not<br />\nadvised), Happy Hour is Monday<br />\nto Friday, 4-6:30 p.m. Wine and<br />\nliquor drinks are two for one,<br />\nbeer is $.50 off, and you can get<br />\nmunchies for half price.<br />\n<br />\nIran<br />\n<br />\nKuwa.,<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nBo,<br />\n<br />\n1 GiV4.<br />\n<br />\nArab,*<br />\n<br />\nQtAitt<br />\n.R.yah<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 1--<br />\n<br />\nU,A.E.<br />\ninv.an\\<br />\n<br />\nSufi:in<br />\n<br />\nThe Middle East situation directly affects some Hopkins students.<br />\n<br />\nthe U.S. will not feel obliged to<br />\nthe Arab nations and get carried<br />\naway by the close cooperation<br />\nwith the Arab states. His fear<br />\nwith the recently proposed sale of<br />\narms to Saudi Arabia is that the<br />\nU.S. will make the same mistake<br />\nwith them as they made when<br />\nthey sold arms to Iraq.<br />\nIf a military conflict should occur, he takes Saddam Hussein's<br />\nthreat to involve Israel very<br />\nseriously, although he believes<br />\nthat Israel will be prepared.<br />\nThough Israel may be prepared<br />\nfor a military conflict, Raad worries that if one should occur, Jordan's traditional enemies\u2014Israel<br />\nand Syria\u2014might try to take advantage of its weakened position.<br />\nDamaj is more saddened than<br />\nworried for her adopted home of<br />\nthe United Arab Emirates.<br />\n\"Things were going very well for<br />\nbusiness in the U.A.E.\" She feels<br />\n<br />\nthat it was on the verge of becoming an important regional center<br />\n\"and then this happened. It's<br />\nvery sad.\"<br />\nShe notes that the crisis<br />\nprevented one student from the<br />\nMiddle East from \u2022 entering<br />\nHopkins, as his family's assets<br />\nwere in Kuwait.<br />\nRaad still harbors faint hopes<br />\nfor the regional solution that his<br />\nking is working for. He believes<br />\nthat the only way Saddam Hussein will leave Kuwait is if a facesaving, regional agreement can<br />\nbe reached.<br />\nUnless this crisis is resolved<br />\nquickly, he knows his homeland<br />\nwill face great economic suffering. But he is philosophical:<br />\n\"Jordan doesn't agree with what<br />\nHussein has done, but Jordan<br />\ndoesn't choose her neighbors.<br />\nShe has to live with them.\"<br />\n<br />\nOverall, I was pretty impressed with the Charles Village Pub.<br />\nIf you're headed there from the<br />\nlibrary, remember your bank<br />\ncard.

Although<br />\nundefeated, a victory against conference opponent Juniata was<br />\ncritical in maintaining post-season<br />\nhopes.<br />\nThe first half of the game<br />\nquickly developed into a defensive battle. Neither team was able<br />\nto control the ball in their offensive zone long enough to sustain<br />\nany kind of threat, let alone<br />\nmanage a shot. However,<br />\nHopkins did enjoy a slight advantage in field position as the ball<br />\nspent most of the half on the<br />\nJuniata half of the field. Late in<br />\nthe period sophomore mid-fielder<br />\nSusan Burner fired a shot inches<br />\noutside the left post representing<br />\nthe best scoring opportunity by<br />\neither team.<br />\nWhile the second half began<br />\nmuch like the first, the Blue Jays<br />\nbegan to take control of the game.<br />\nPlay moved entirely in the Juniata<br />\nhalf of the field as Hopkins<br />\nmanaged several shots. Midway<br />\nthrough the period Burner hit the<br />\noutside of the post with a hard<br />\n<br />\nshot. Juniata was having trouble<br />\nclearing their zone when senior<br />\nforward Jennifer Chun pushed a<br />\nsoft shot toward the goal.<br />\nAlthough the ball never reached<br />\nthe goal, the officials did call a<br />\npenalty corner. Chun sent the ball<br />\ninto play, and Burner again hit the<br />\npost.<br />\nWith the momentum building,<br />\nshots hitting posts, and<br />\ndominating play, it was only a<br />\nmatter of time. On the next penalty corner, Chun passed the ball<br />\ntoward Burner again, However,<br />\ninstead of stopping the ball for<br />\nBurner, senior mid-fielder and cocaptain Kathy Herring took the<br />\nshot herself. The shot was<br />\ndeflected by a Juniata defender,<br />\nbut sophomore forward Donna<br />\nWilliamson managed to control<br />\nthe ball and score from three<br />\nyards out giving Hopkins a 1-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nAfter several minutes of play<br />\nand the score still 1-0, Juniata<br />\nforced the ball into the Hopkins<br />\nhalf of the field, Juniata coach<br />\nKathi Quinn then pulled her<br />\ngoalie in favor of an extra<br />\nshooter. The Jays' defense led by<br />\nthe spirited play of senior Courtney DeVries was equal to the<br />\ntask. The extra player proved insignificant as Hopkins quickly<br />\ncleared the ball down the field<br />\nwhere it remained throughout the<br />\n<br />\ngame. Although the Jays did not<br />\ncapitalize on the empty net, they<br />\nkept solid pressure for the final<br />\nminutes of the game preventing<br />\nJuniata from getting out of their<br />\nown end of the field.<br />\nIn other notes, senior midfielder and co-captain Meredith<br />\nBlitz returned to play a full game<br />\nafter being knocked out of the<br />\nGettysburg contest.

While many<br />\nplayers had outstanding personal<br />\nperformances, none could match<br />\nthe play of freshman forward<br />\nBeth Cariello and sophmore goal<br />\nkeeper Alec King. Without their<br />\ncontributions the outcome of the<br />\ngame could have been significantly different.

Scott is used to coming<br />\nin, so we wanted to keep it that<br />\nway. Especially in the home<br />\nopener, under the lights.\"<br />\nCade entered the game with the<br />\nball on the FDU 33 yard line after<br />\na 3-yard punt that had excellent<br />\nhang time. Once downed by the<br />\npunter (yes, the punter), Cade<br />\nquickly moved the Jays into a first<br />\nand goal from the six. Hopkins<br />\nappeared poised to score when<br />\nFDU's defense sacked Cade for<br />\na six-yard loss.

My enthusiasm to hit the streets and examine some real life Hopkins injuries was tempered by my desire<br />\nto \"put a hurtin' on\" in another<br />\nsection of the News-Letter. Can<br />\nyou say bruised ego?<br />\nBut really folks, back to more<br />\nimportant matters. We have<br />\nanother boring, canned injury<br />\nfrom the sports medicine bible.<br />\nIt's one of those \"I don't know<br />\nwhat it feels like, but I must have<br />\nit\" jobs: tennis elbow. Incredibly, tennis elbow draws two<br />\npages of attention in the book's<br />\n<br />\n\"Common Injuries and What to<br />\nDo About Them\" section. Incidentally, now that you all know<br />\nmy secret, please don't go out and<br />\nread the book. You'll put me out<br />\nof a job. Tennis elbow results<br />\nfrom excessive strain on the<br />\nforearm muscles which attach at<br />\nthe elbow. There's forehand and<br />\nbackhand tennis elbow, and different racquets, court surfaces,<br />\nstring tension, and grip size apparently play some role. The<br />\ntaboo with tennis elbow is to have<br />\ntoo much wrist in your swing;<br />\nyou should have a smooth motion<br />\nwhich emphasizes upper arm<br />\nmovement. This is bad news for<br />\n<br />\nback-spin hacks like me. The only treatment for tennis elbow<br />\n(which can also result from bowling, pitching and cross-country<br />\nskiing. And to think they call it<br />\ntennis elbow) is rest followed by<br />\nstrengthening of the muscles in<br />\nthe area. By using our deductive<br />\npowers we can reason that tennis<br />\nelbow is essentially shin splints of<br />\nthe arm, or vice versa. Is this column insightful or what? Tune in<br />\nnext week, when if I don't have<br />\nsomething more interesting to<br />\nsay, then I don't have an anterior<br />\ncruciate ligament (rumor has it<br />\nthat Thurman Thomas doesn't<br />\nhave one either),<br />\n<br />\nbuddy pass along the sidelines to<br />\nChris Ogeneski was followed by<br />\na sweep to Paul Ferreri that put<br />\nthe ball i/2 yard away from the<br />\ngoal line.<br />\nIt was just a formality at that<br />\npoint, right?

However, after some<br />\nconfusion and a brief conversation between the officials,<br />\nHopkins was given possession but did not receive points for<br />\nthe goal. Catholic controlled the<br />\nball following the free hit, moved the ball down the field and<br />\ndirected a shot toward the Blue<br />\nJay's goal. King saved the shot<br />\nbut the rebound was perilously<br />\nclose to being tapped in until<br />\nsenior defender Courtney<br />\nDeVries cleared the ball quelling<br />\nthe CU threat.<br />\nThe Jays took possession of the<br />\nball and carried it into the<br />\nCatholic half of the field. After<br />\nseveral shots closely missed,<br />\nCariello eventually took control<br />\nof a loose ball on an exceptional<br />\neffort in front of the Catholic<br />\ngoal.

As Susan Burner<br />\ncontinued to fire her hard shots,<br />\nJennifer Chun used her speed and<br />\none-on-one maneuvering to maintain pressure on the Catholic<br />\ngoal. Senior midfielder and cocaptian Kathy Herring also contributed significantly to this effort<br />\nby controlling numerous free<br />\nballs at midfield.<br />\nEven with these outstanding<br />\nplayers, the offense belonged to<br />\nCariello. The freshman forward<br />\nscored all three second half goals<br />\ngiving her four for the game and<br />\nseven for the season. Her first of<br />\nthe second half came on a fluke<br />\nplay.

Now,<br />\nRIGHT?!? Wrong, On a repeat Of<br />\nsecond down the Jays fumbled<br />\nand recovered, on the 6. Hopkins<br />\ntried a reverse that was stopped<br />\nat the line of scrimmage. On<br />\nfourth down, Cade found running back Nick Romagnoli for a<br />\ntouchdown. The only problem<br />\nwas offensive interference was<br />\ncalled, giving FDU-Madison the<br />\nball.<br />\nAfter an inconsequential<br />\nchange of possession, the half<br />\nended with the Jays down 7-0.<br />\n\"How many times did we have<br />\na chance to score?\" Magraff<br />\nwondered. \"I let them know [at<br />\nhalftime] I wasn't very pleased,<br />\nlet's put it that way. I told them<br />\nthere are things you've got to stop<br />\ndoing in order to be a good football team. You've got to stop<br />\nfumbling, you've got to stop<br />\nthrowing interceptions, and hey,<br />\nwhen the ball is on the one-foot<br />\nline, you've got to score.\"<br />\nThe third quarter was a replica<br />\nof the opening half. Both teams'<br />\ndefenses controlled the action and<br />\nprevented any long scoring<br />\ndrives. With 4:10 remaining in<br />\nthe third, FDU-Madison downed<br />\na punt on the 1, and appeared to<br />\nput the Blue Jays in a dire strait.<br />\nTwo Paul Ferreri runs and an<br />\nillegal procedure on Hopkins kept<br />\nthe Jays at the 1. On a third and<br />\n10 Cade was forced to scramble<br />\nand by the length of his shoe picked up a first down. After two incomplete bombs and an offensive<br />\nholding, Hopkins faced a second<br />\n<br />\nand 16 from the 6 yard line.<br />\nUnder pressure, Cade found a<br />\ndiving Richards over the middle.<br />\nTwo plays later, Cade and<br />\nRichards teamed up for a 41 yard<br />\nbomb. With the ball on the FDU<br />\n32, Cade scrambled for seven,<br />\nand connected with Richards<br />\nagain along the sidelines for 8<br />\nyards. On the first play of the<br />\nfourth quarter, Hopkins finally<br />\nscored by running a reverse to<br />\nDave Cozenza. Believing that his<br />\ndefense would continue to hold<br />\nFDU, Margraff called for the two<br />\npoint conversion. Cade rolled out<br />\nand flipped a pass to Eric Mont<br />\nfor the deuce and the 8-7 lead.<br />\nIt appeared the Jays would<br />\nmaintain the slim lead. However,<br />\nwith 7:03 remaining Paul Ferreri<br />\ncoughed up the ball to FDU on<br />\nthe Blue Jay 13. Three plays<br />\nlater, FDU scored for a 13-8<br />\nlead. At this point the Jersey<br />\nDevils made a strange decision.<br />\nInstead of going for two, which<br />\nwould have possibly given FDU<br />\na seven point lead, they went for<br />\nthe extra point. A six point lead<br />\ncould be wiped away by a TD and<br />\nextra point. At any rate, FDU<br />\nmissed the extra point.<br />\nAs the clock ticked away, anxiety set in as the Jays stalled on<br />\nthier next drive. With 2:25 remaining, the Jays took the field<br />\nin excellent field position. From<br />\nthe FDU 45, Scott Cade scrambled for twenty yards. Two passes<br />\nto Lou Angelos for fifteen yards<br />\nand Chris Ogeneski for seven<br />\nmoved the Jays to the 3 yard line.<br />\nFrom the full house backfield,<br />\n<br />\nCade play action faked and threw<br />\nto the diving Tom Dretler for the<br />\nTD. The Jays went for two to<br />\ngive themselves a three point<br />\ncushion. Looking like Edwin<br />\nMoses, Cade scrambled and<br />\nhurdled a defender for the two<br />\nand 16-13 lead.<br />\n1:15 remained on the clock<br />\nwhen FDU's offense marched<br />\nonto the field. As Hopkins<br />\ndefense made its way on the turf,<br />\nit included offensive tackle Frank<br />\nGangemi.<br />\n\"I don't think there was<br />\nanything that was going to stop<br />\nFrank Gangemi in the last couple<br />\nof minutes. When it's on the line,<br />\ngreat players want to be out<br />\nthere,\" said Margraff.<br />\nOn the first two plays of the<br />\ndrive Frank Gangemi sacked the<br />\nquarterback. On the third play, Stu<br />\nMarkley (who finished the game<br />\nwith 13 tackles) intercepted<br />\nFDU's quarterback Mark<br />\nRoedelbronn to ensure the<br />\nvictory.<br />\nMargraff said later, \"We are<br />\ndoing some things a good football<br />\nteam does. This is the third time<br />\nwe've scored with the two minute<br />\ndrill in three games.

Thanks should also go to the person who sent the<br />\nnote that read: \"QM: I am pleased to hear of your recent<br />\nappointment, and hope that in the future I will know some<br />\nquestions on one of your quizzes. In the meantime, I offer you my eternal love if you give me the ten dollars and<br />\ncase of beer. Until then, I ache for your touch.\" Unfortunately, the note was anonymous. Anyone knowing<br />\nanything about this, please leave info at the Gatehouse.<br />\nPlease. Pretty please. With sugar on top.<br />\nAhern. Sorry about that.

(Actually, it doesn't, but segues were never<br />\nmy strong suit.)<br />\nAs I write this, Wednesday night (well past my<br />\ndeadline), I am missing what must be a historic event. Yes,<br />\nI'm talking about the season premiere of \"Cop Rock.\"<br />\nIn, well, honor of this, I decided to base the quiz on what<br />\nI believe to be one of the great strengths of this show: the<br />\ncommercials. Each of the following twenty-five questions<br />\nis a famous (or not-so-famous) slogan from a television<br />\ncommercial.

Copyright 1990, USA Today. Reprinted with permission.<br /><br />\nAccording to Dean of Students<br />\nSusan Boswell, the University has<br />\ncreated an ad hoc committee to<br />\nexamine the role of the Reserve<br />\nOfficer Training Corps(ROTC)<br />\nat Hopkins, particularly its stated<br />\npolicy of excluding lesbians and<br />\nhomosexuals. The committee will<br />\nassess campus attitudes among<br />\nstudents, faculty, and staff, and<br />\ngather information from peer institutions, Boswell said.<br />\nExplaining why the committee<br />\nwas formed, Dean of Homewood<br />\nSchools and Services Chris Columbo cited a \"concern raised by<br />\nsome undergraduates.\" The committee represents a promise to<br />\nlook at the issue, he said.<br />\nPaul DelGrosso, president of<br />\nthe Hopkins Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance(GALA)and a member<br />\nof the new committee, thinks the<br />\nUniversity should apply its nondiscrimination policy in \"the true<br /><br />\nspirit of\" the clause; in other<br />\nwords, to all programs on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe clause states that the<br />\nUniversity \"does not discriminate<br />\non the basis of. . . homosexuality. . . in any program or activity,<br />\nincluding administration of its<br />\neducational policies. . .scholarship and loans programs. . .and<br />\nother University-administered<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\nHopkins Army ROTC Commanding Officer Lt. Colonel<br />\nRobert E. Jalette disagreed with<br />\nDelGrosso's reading of the<br />\nclause. \"The commissioning of<br />\nofficers into the United States Army is under the direction of the<br />\nDepartment of Defense,\" he explained. \"The program is<br />\nseparate from the University\"<br />\nand does not fall within the<br />\nUniversity's nondiscrimination<br />\nclause, he said.<br />\nJalette also stated that ROTC<br />\nfinancial aid falls under federal<br /><br />\ngovernment guidelines. \"A different set of criteria\" applies to<br />\ncadets receiving government<br />\nfinancial aid than those receiving<br />\naid from Hopkins, he said.<br />\nA spokesman for the Army<br />\nCadet Command at Fort Monroe,<br />\nVa., reiterated Jalette's point,<br />\nsaying that \"Army ROTC is<br />\ngoverned by the DOD and goes<br />\nby its directives.\"<br />\nDOD directive 1332.14, which<br />\nwas revised in January 1982, prohibits homosexuals from entering<br />\nany branch of the armed forces,<br />\naccording to Major Hart of the<br />\nDOD Information office. He also<br />\nstated that the courts, to date,<br />\nhave upheld the directive.<br />\nJalette stressed that military<br />\nscience classes are \"open to the<br />\nentire student body.\"<br />\nThe Army Cadet Command<br />\nclaims to exclude lesbians and<br />\nhomosexuals from the commissioning program for the same<br />\nreasons it would restrict \"so-<br /><br />\nBreadth of Biology<br />\nMajor Debated<br />\nanatomy class, which is not offered to undergraduates at<br />\n\"It is sad that a school that is Hopkins.<br />\nShe tried to enroll in the<br />\nso health-profession oriented is so<br />\nclass offered at the<br />\nanatomy<br />\nclosed to anything other than a<br />\nbut was strongschool,<br />\nmedical<br />\nmedical school,\" said senior<br />\nby the prodiscouraged<br />\nly<br />\nbiology major Karen Wendel.<br />\nher that the<br />\ntold<br />\nfessor,who<br />\nSome biology majors claim that<br />\nfor an<br />\nsuited<br />\nnot<br />\nwas<br />\ncourse<br />\nthe major emphasizes pre-med<br />\nundergraduate.<br />\ntraining (providing preparation<br />\nLuzetti went to Dr. Saul<br />\nfor medical school) and does not<br />\nformer chair of the<br />\nRoseman,<br />\nprovide as much diversity as it<br />\nof Biology, who sugDepartment<br />\nshould.<br />\ntake advantage of<br />\nshe<br />\nthat<br />\ngested<br />\n\"We're missing a few basic<br />\nin Hopkins'<br />\noffered<br />\ncourses<br />\ncourses that would greatly imof ContinuSchool<br />\n(the<br />\nschools<br />\nprove the department,\" said<br />\nSchool,<br />\nMedical<br />\nthe<br />\nStudies,<br />\ning<br />\nto<br />\ngo<br />\nto<br />\nWendel, who is planning<br />\nand<br />\nHealth<br />\nPublic<br />\nof<br />\nSchool<br />\nthe<br />\nto<br />\nwanted<br />\nmedical school. \"We<br />\nprogram.<br />\nget a greater breadth of biology.

A proposal was submitted to Student<br />\nCouncil President Bob Nelson as<br />\nwell as Dean Columbo, head of<br />\nHomewood Schools and Services<br />\nto re-establish a student radio station (WHOP) on campus.<br />\nThe initial set-up cost, according to the prospective radio station (WHOP) president Brian<br />\nLiddicoat, would be $12,500,<br />\nwith an extra $1,000 cost for each<br />\nadditional building that would<br />\ncarry the station. The station<br />\nwould be broadcast through a carrier current which would work<br />\nslightly differently than the<br />\ntypical FM frequency.<br />\nRadio transmitters would be<br />\nhooked up to a building's power<br /><br />\nAndy Barnert of WHOP.<br /><br />\ntransformer and the signal would<br />\nbe transferred through the electrical lines of the building. The<br />\nstation could be broadcast only in<br />\nthe buildings with the transmitters, since each building's electrical system would act as a giant<br />\nantenna but the insulation of the<br />\nwalls would prevent the electromagnetic current from leaving<br />\nthe building. This method,<br />\nassured Liddicoat, would not interfere with the electrical power<br />\nor phone lines of the buildings.<br />\nThe radio's managing board,<br />\nwhich includes General Manager<br />\nAndy Barnert, Programming<br />\nDirector Richard Schwartz,<br />\nBusiness Manager Mira Vayda<br />\nand Chief Engineer Adam Haberfield, in addition to Liddicoat,<br />\ndevised a plan that begins with<br />\nAMR I and II and Buildings A<br />\nand B, which means only people<br />\nin those buildings could hear the<br />\nbroadcast. They hope to expand<br />\nto Gilman and Levering and then<br />\ntake their broadcast off campus,<br />\ninto Wolman and McCoy, by<br />\nrunning the signal over phone<br />\nlines.<br />\nWith the permission of<br />\nlandlords, they hope to extend<br />\nWHOP to non-university owned<br />\napartments, but excluding the<br />\nsurrounding rowhouses. Andy<br />\nBarnert explained that installation<br />\nwould be impractical, costing approximately $680 to $1200 for<br />\neach additional rowhouse. He is<br />\nlooking at the possibility of expanding the station into cable FM<br />\nso all students with cable TV<br />\ncould receive the station.<br />\nThe plan is ambitious in light<br /><br />\nof Hopkins' uncertain past in the<br />\narea of communications. In the<br />\n1940's, students started to broadcast across the P.A. system in<br />\nLevering. In the 1960's, the station was transmitted on an AM<br />\ncarrier current with wiring in<br />\nAMR I and II. Only in 1979 did<br />\nstudents finally obtain an FCC<br />\nlicense and begin to broadcast on<br />\nan FM frequency\u2014WJHU 88.1<br />\nFM.<br />\nThe station was run from the<br />\nbasement of AMR II and later<br />\nmoved to the back of Lazear,<br />\nwhere the new radio crew hopes<br />\nto begin programming.<br />\nWhen the FCC passed a regulation invalidating 10 watt stations,<br />\nWJHU was forced to obtain a 100<br />\nwatt license and subsequently lost<br />\nmoney.

Not that this<br />\nsurprised Miranda; it just gave<br />\nher something to think about<br />\nwhile waiting.<br />\n\"You ever been to<br />\nDisneyworld?\" Zack asked.<br />\n\"California to Florida?

Students interested in going to medical school receive excellent<br />\npreparation in key areas. They also receive faculty and administrative support when applying, and<br />\nthey benefit from having many students of high<br />\nacademic ability with similar goals in their<br />\nprogram.<br />\nMost undergraduates who plan to go to medical<br />\nschool major in biology. The biology department<br />\nat Hopkins prepares students well for medical<br />\nschool by offering an especially strong background<br />\nin biochemistry and cellular biology. Hopkins<br />\nstudents have an extremely high acceptance rate<br />\nto medical school, and once there, they are very<br />\nsuccessful. These strengths attest to Hopkins' success as a pre-medical institution and offer benefits<br />\nto both individual students and the institution as<br />\na whole.<br />\nHopkins undergraduates also benefit from their<br />\ncontact with current research in biology. The size<br />\nand structure of the department allow students to<br />\nget involved with faculty members who are at the<br />\ntop of their fields. Students participate in and contribute to the work in progress within the department. They are a part of the process\u2014not just<br />\nobservers\u2014and as a result their education extends<br />\nbeyond the dimensions of classroom learning. They<br />\nare engaged in the material and the issues more<br />\nintimately, and at a higher level, than is possible<br />\nat most institutions.<br />\nThe attention of the faculty and administration,<br />\nthe specific strengths and emphasis of the department, and the unique opportunities in research<br />\nprepare students extremely well for medical school<br />\nor graduate work and research careers in biology.<br />\nBut the courses offered in the biology department<br />\nare limited in scope and cater only to students who<br />\nplan to work in these specific areas. Students interested in pursuing careers in the health professions who do not want to attend medical school cannot, in many cases, fulfill the prerequisites for a<br />\nprofessional program during their four years at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt is not reasonable to expect the biology department at a school of this size to be excellent in all<br />\nfields, or even to offer courses in every possible<br />\narea of interest. It is reasonable, however, to<br />\nassume that students interested in the health pro-<br /><br />\nfessions may come here intending to apply to<br />\nmedical school but later decide against it during<br />\na course of study. It should be possible for a student to make a logical, lateral move within a<br />\ngeneral course of study and be able to leave<br />\nHopkins prepared for his or her chosen professional<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThe strengths of the biology department here at<br />\nHopkins are unique and valuable, but they do not<br />\nserve as excuse nor explanation for the lack of options available to students interested in other health<br />\nprofesions or in an alternative in biology. With attention to the needs of these students, a few courses<br />\ncould be added to the curriculum. These courses<br />\nwould address the needs of atypical Hopkins<br />\nbiology students specifically, but they would also<br />\nserve as valuable options for other biology students<br />\nand the rest of the University population. Though<br />\nnot required for entrance to medical school, the<br />\ncourses would still be of interest to many and highly<br />\nrelevant to the field. They would also offer greater<br />\nchoices to students who are interested in basic<br />\nnatural science courses but who do not have the<br />\nbackground in chemistry to take most of the biology<br />\ncourses in the current curriculum.<br />\nFilling the gaps would not place unreasonable<br />\nfinancial or teaching demands on the department.<br />\nIt would in no way detract from the strengths of<br />\nHopkins, but it would more closely align the curriculum with those of Hopkins' peer institutions,<br />\nand it would directly serve the academic needs and<br />\ninterests of Hopkins undergraduates.<br /><br />\nFew aspects of the University come under such<br />\nconsistent criticism as Campus Security. Students<br />\nat Hopkins absorb the evolving canon of Security<br />\njokes far more readily than they absorb the fundamentals of any 100-level lecture class. And<br />\nwhat's the surprise in that? Hopkins Security Police<br />\ncan often seem like dull, bloated caricatures of<br />\n\"real police.\" They harass students. They do<br />\nnothing but tool around campus in their oversized<br />\nsedans and eat doughnuts. The emergency<br />\ntelephones that dot the campus connect directly to<br />\nthe AMR II snack bar\u2014or so the jokes inform us.<br />\nBut what's the issue behind the jokes?<br />\nNext Week in Editorial<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nTwo Letters on Behalf of ROTC; Beneath Every Renovated<br />\nUniversity Building Is a Water Lining and Temporary Carpet<br />\nTo the Editors:<br /><br />\nLast week's article, \"Send<br />\nHopkins ROTC Packing\" was, in<br />\na word, disturbing.

This suggests that these<br />\ncourses are not worth very much<br />\nin the eyes of the administration.<br />\nPerhaps a little history is in<br />\norder. The art program at<br />\nHomewood began in the fall of<br />\n1974, on the initiative of(can you<br />\nbelieve it?) then-President Steven<br />\nMuller. Eugene Leake had just<br />\nretired as President of Maryland<br />\nInstitute/College of Art(MICA),<br />\nand Muller invited him to be the<br />\nfirst artist in residence at<br />\nHopkins. Leake originally taught<br />\nonly one day a week but had increased his workload by around<br />\n1980. At that time he wanted to<br />\nconcentrate more on his own<br />\npainting, so Craig Hankin was<br />\nhired.<br />\nStudent interest was strong at<br />\nthe beginning of each semester,<br />\nbut people often dropped out of<br />\nthe non-credit classes around<br />\nmid-term, probably due to increased accredited academic<br />\nwork. With the help of then-Dean<br />\nof Students Chris Columbo, the<br />\ncourses were granted one credit.<br />\nThis halted the mid-semester<br />\ndrop-off, and the classes have<br />\nalways been filled since. Clearly, the difference between a onecredit course and a no-credit<br />\ncourse is significant.<br />\nThis year two new classes are<br />\nbeing offered. Currently, Cartooning is taught by Baltimore<br />\ncartoonist Tom Chalkley. In the<br />\nspring Two-dimensional Design<br />\nwill be offered. Originally Cartooning was a non-credit course.<br />\nA proposal for a new course must<br />\nbe submitted to the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies (CUS),<br />\n!,MIN11<br />\n..1M.\u25a0<br /><br />\nAor<br /><br />\nMEM<br /><br />\nAffilmor<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nbut apparently the proposal was<br />\nrejected without even being considered, since it didn't come from<br />\nan official department. The<br />\nHumanities Center intervened,<br />\nand the courses are now offered<br />\nwith its official sponsorship.<br />\nSurprisingly, the studio program has no relationship with the<br />\nDepartment of Art History. This<br />\nis in keeping with the Germanic<br />\ntradition Hopkins venerates, but<br /><br />\nWhy Johns Hopkins<br />\ntreats the fine arts<br />\nas a 'soft'<br />\nmental activity<br /><br />\nin contrast to such \"peer institutions\" as Yale or Cornell,<br />\nwhere the art history departments<br />\nare coupled with a fine arts studio<br />\nprogram, forcing students to participate in the creative process to<br />\nbetter understand it.<br />\nWhy does the University treat<br />\nthe fine arts so shabbily? According to Associate Dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences Michael Beer, the<br />\nart program differs in that all<br />\nother subjects have home departments, and without that structure<br />\nin place, \"they\" have no way of<br />\nmonitoring the program or instructors. Beer's reliance on nonreferential pronouns clouds the<br />\nsubject. When questioned about<br />\nwho he meant with all of his we's<br />\nand they's he said, \"Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" (Surely not the<br />\nfounder?)<br />\nClearly he means the administrators, who keep the trust<br />\nof the University. Never before<br />\nhas an administrator admitted that<br />\nhe doesn't know how things<br />\nwork. Beer asserts that fine arts<br />\nare outside the purview that is<br />\nJohns Hopkins and therefore giving full credits to courses where<br />\nthe University has no experience<br />\nwould be a betrayal of the high<br />\nstandards JHU trumpets. In other<br />\nwords, such a foray into the arts<br />\nwould undermine the University's \"credibility.\"<br />\nContinued on page 6<br /><br />\n-miNSMN/M<br /><br />\n116-alEhomME<br /><br />\n11\u202265\u20221=11..._<br /><br />\n6/SEPTEMBER 28, 1990<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from page 5<br />\nkitchens, bathrooms,<br />\nin<br />\nbedrooms and hallways.

It's a place<br />\nto see art, art that is disturbing<br />\nart that often accurately portrays<br />\nour society, and successfully<br />\nmocks it. This month, the<br />\nBAUhouse features an exhibit<br />\ncalled \"Censored/Censured,\" a<br />\ncollection of works from the MidAtlantic which at one time or<br />\nanother were deemed obscene or<br />\nunacceptable and banned from<br />\npublic view.<br />\nUpon first walking into the<br />\ngallery, I was struck by the nature<br />\nof the exhibit. There is something<br />\njust not right about these works.<br />\nThey make your skin crawl. This<br />\nis not to say that they are ugly or<br />\ngrotesque. Rather, they run the<br />\ngamut of extremes in sensuality,<br />\ngraphic bluntness and sheer<br />\nhorror.<br />\nMany of the works are<br />\nundeniably sexually explicit, and<br />\nsome of the topics covered are not<br />\nfound in the arena of polite<br />\ndiscussion: child abuse, rape, incest, racism. On the other hand,<br />\nmany of the paintings and<br />\nphotographs are beautiful. But<br />\nwhat unites these works is the<br />\nfeeling they collectively express<br />\nabout our society, a malaise or<br />\ndiscontent with the way we currently are.<br />\nOne such work, Thomas<br />\nSegars' \"Patriot,\" depicts a man<br />\nwhose eyes are blindfolded. The<br /><br />\nblindfold is an American flag.<br />\nThe painting was at one time<br />\nwithdrawn from an art show for<br />\nbeing \"inappropriate.\"<br />\n\"As I watched people scuffling<br />\nover burning flags,\" comments<br />\nSegar, \"I thought about how<br />\nmuch attention was being paid to<br />\nthe symbol, and that perhaps<br />\nmore attention should be paid to<br />\nthe idea that it's supposed to<br />\nrepresent. Phrases like 'wrapping<br />\nhimself in the flag' and 'blind<br /><br />\npatriotism' came to mind and the<br />\nimage of the blindfolded man<br />\npresented itself to me. Although<br />\nperhaps not the world's most<br />\noriginal image, it visualized my<br />\nfeelings and I painted it.\"<br />\n\"Just beneath the deceptively<br />\ncalm surface of what is often called a free society can lurk a surprisingly turbulent and continuous conflict of ideas, over<br />\nsuch things as the boundaries of<br />\ncensorship in art, the freedom of<br /><br />\nexpression, and perhaps even<br />\nwhat thought should be expressed. This was the disturbing part<br />\nto learn.\"<br />\nAnother censored painting is<br />\nMartin Palombo's \"The Magician.\" It depicts two men standing together, one dressed in a<br />\nmagician's tuxedo, the other<br />\ngarbed in white. The hair of the<br />\nman in white is painted as flames,<br />\nand on his shoulders rides a rabbit. In his comments Mr. Patom-<br /><br />\nbo actually felt flattered that the<br />\ncensors who refused his work<br />\ncouldn't actually give him a<br />\nreason why.<br />\n\"They just wanted it to go<br />\naway,\" he says.<br />\nIt's a convincing argument<br />\nwhen one views some of the<br />\ntamer items in the collection. One<br />\npiece was a coloring book of<br />\nWashington, D.C. called Color<br />\nthe Burg, which was banned<br />\nbecause its editors felt \"certain<br /><br />\ndrawings in the book looked<br />\nsatanic.\"<br />\nMark Hossfeld, one of the exhibit organizers, feels the art is<br />\n\"very, very tame.\"<br />\n\"A lot of the problem is today's climate,\" he says \"Petty<br />\nbureaucrats in a courthouse feel<br />\nthey can do something by censoring at will.\"<br />\nHe feels responsiblity for the<br />\nproblem lies in part with the<br />\nmedia in which most of this art<br />\nis created. Literature, he says,<br />\nhas been as explicit and sexual as<br />\nany of these works, yet the National Endowment for the Arts<br />\nhas had no qualms about funding<br />\nworks of writing. He believes the<br />\nvisceral nature of a visual<br />\nmessage arouses an instinctual<br />\nfear of the work. He also doesn't<br />\nfeel this is a fad issue. \"It's going to be around for quite a<br />\nwhile,\" he says, \"and it's going<br />\nto get worse before it gets<br />\nbetter.\"<br />\n\"It's a question of survival,\"<br />\nhe says. \"Without support is it<br />\neven economically feasible to<br />\ncreate art at all?\"<br />\nYet he has his own solution to<br />\nthis problem. \"View this art,\" he<br />\nsays. \"Support this art.

The Hopkins senior is<br />\na native of Jordan.<br />\nRaad is one of a handful of<br />\nHopkins students from Middle<br />\nEastern countries. Their perspectives on the invasion of Kuwait<br />\nand the U.S. military presence in<br />\nSaudi Arabia are largely shaped<br />\nby the fact that they are Arab or<br />\nIsraeli.<br />\nAt home in Jordan when<br />\nKuwait was invaded, Raad was<br />\nsurprised by the invasion. \"It was<br />\ntotally unexpected.\"<br />\nMaha Damaj, a Lebanese expatriate whose family lives in the<br />\nUnited Arab Emirates, recalls being scared when Kuwait was<br />\ninvaded.<br />\nDamaj believes that Saddam<br />\nHussein's invasion was an extreme reaction to failed talks with<br />\nKuwaiti leaders.<br />\n\"I think the solution to this problem was well within Arab<br />\nhands. I feel that if the U.S. had<br />\nnot intervened that there would<br />\nhave been a chance for an Arab<br /><br />\nsolution.\"<br />\nHowever, she, is glad that the<br />\nU.S. is there now to prevent Iraq<br />\nfrom doing anything more<br />\nextreme.<br />\nA Hopkins student who lived<br />\nin Israel for several years echoed<br />\nthis latter sentiment. \"I am glad<br />\nthe U.S. acted forcefully and<br />\nquickly.\" In his mind, the U.S.<br />\npresence sends a message to the<br />\nterrorist countries of the region<br />\nthat they cannot act in the manner which President Hussein has.<br />\nRaad and his nation support the<br />\nUnited Nations and the sanctions,<br />\nbut both the impact of the sanctions and the foreign intervention<br />\nworries him.<br />\nJordan supports the sanctions<br />\nbecause it believes that the invasion was wrong, but its economy<br />\nis suffering tremendously. Its<br />\neconomy is very closely tied to<br />\nIraq's. Before the invasion of<br />\nKuwait, forty percent of Jordanian economic activity directly<br />\ninvolved Iraq. As a result of the<br />\nsanctions, unemployment and inflation have started to rise, and<br />\nRaad fears unrest among the<br />\npeople.<br /><br />\n\"The Kuwaitis got the worst of<br />\nthe invasion, certainly, but Jordan is not far behind.\"<br />\nIn addition to the economic<br />\nproblems created by the sanctions, it is also difficult, politically, for the King of Jordan to oppose Saddam Hussein. Many of<br />\nRaad's countrymen see the Iraqi<br />\nPresident as a hero.<br />\nRaad believes that for many<br />\nJordanians, especially poorer<br />\nones, seeing the Iraqi leader defying the Western powers has<br />\nrekindled their feelings of resentment against the Western Imperialist powers who have oppressed them in the past.<br />\nBoth Raad and Damaj condemn<br />\nSaddam Hussein's actions, but<br />\nthey know that many of their<br />\nfellow Arabs do not.<br />\nDamaj believes that the Iraqi<br />\nleader's action, extreme though<br />\nit was, made many Arabs \"wake<br />\nup and smell the coffee. The invasion of Kuwait proved that the<br />\nArabs are a force to be reckoned<br />\nwith.\"<br />\nShe notes that the Palestinians<br />\nidentified with President Hussein<br />\nbecause they thought, short-<br /><br />\nsightedly, \"that here was someone who was willing to stand up<br />\nto the West. Maybe he could<br />\nsolve our problems.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins student from<br />\nIsrael agrees with this impression,<br />\nadding that \"the Palestinians see<br />\ntheir hopes tied in with Saddam<br />\nHussein because he tried to make<br />\nit an Arab-Israeli issue from the<br />\nbeginning.\"<br />\nHe believes that the antiAmericanism is on the rise in the<br />\nMiddle East, in no small part<br />\nbecause the U.S. is trying to stop<br />\nthe leader of Iraq.<br />\nRaad fears the rise of both antiAmericanism and Islamic Fundamentalism. He believes that if<br />\nthe U.S. acts militarily against<br />\nIraq that it will be like \"lighting<br />\na fuse\" under these two forces.<br />\nRaad is also concerned with the<br />\nlong-term implications of<br />\nWestern intervention in the Gulf.<br />\nHe and Damaj share the view that<br />\nsince the U.S. now has a foothold<br />\nin the region it will probably stay<br />\nthere.<br />\nThe U.S. presence in the area<br />\nraises a different concern for the<br />\nstudent from Israel.

The<br />\nTerrace Room is closed. Home<br />\nmeans waiting for the shuttle and<br />\nhoping that you'll be able to make<br />\nit back to campus before day<br />\nbreaks. But there is light at the<br />\nend of the tunnel.<br />\nWalking distance (although if<br />\nit's late I wouldn't walk alone)<br />\nfrom the MSE is the Charles<br />\nVillage Pub.

Go in, I think you'll like<br />\nit.<br />\nFor beginners, I recommend<br />\nMexican Potato Skins ($3.95).<br />\nFor \u2022an appetizer, these are<br />\nenough to split. Or if you're really not that hungry, you might<br />\nwant to try the Mexican Potato<br />\n($2.50) as an entree. Both are<br />\ngreat. They have just the right<br />\nmixture of spice and flavor. Of<br />\ncourse, if you're not really into<br /><br />\njalepenos on your skins, they'll<br />\nleave them off at your request.<br />\nThe sandwich/dinner menu offers a variety of things: there's the<br />\ntraditional Hopkins Club ($4.95)<br />\nwhich consists of roast beef,<br />\nswiss, onion, lettuce, tomato, and<br />\nmayo, the 4 oz. bacon<br />\ncheeseburger ($3.50), the BBQ<br />\nchicken breast ($5.50), and the<br />\nalluring Goucher Club ($4.95)<br />\nwhich is chicken salad, bacon,<br />\nlettuce, tomato, and mayo. Or if<br />\nyou want something a little<br />\nlighter, they also have a few<br />\nsalads, notably a nice spinach<br />\nsalad ($3.50). All the sandwiches<br /><br />\nare served with chips and dip; this<br />\nis a refreshing change if you don't<br />\nlike french fries.<br />\nThe Charles Village Pub decor<br />\nis dominated by sports photos;<br />\nfrom baseball to horse racing,<br />\neven bobsledding.

He believes<br />\nthat the only way Saddam Hussein will leave Kuwait is if a facesaving, regional agreement can<br />\nbe reached.<br />\nUnless this crisis is resolved<br />\nquickly, he knows his homeland<br />\nwill face great economic suffering. But he is philosophical:<br />\n\"Jordan doesn't agree with what<br />\nHussein has done, but Jordan<br />\ndoesn't choose her neighbors.<br />\nShe has to live with them.\"<br /><br />\nOverall, I was pretty impressed with the Charles Village Pub.<br />\nIf you're headed there from the<br />\nlibrary, remember your bank<br />\ncard.

Although<br />\nundefeated, a victory against conference opponent Juniata was<br />\ncritical in maintaining post-season<br />\nhopes.<br />\nThe first half of the game<br />\nquickly developed into a defensive battle. Neither team was able<br />\nto control the ball in their offensive zone long enough to sustain<br />\nany kind of threat, let alone<br />\nmanage a shot. However,<br />\nHopkins did enjoy a slight advantage in field position as the ball<br />\nspent most of the half on the<br />\nJuniata half of the field. Late in<br />\nthe period sophomore mid-fielder<br />\nSusan Burner fired a shot inches<br />\noutside the left post representing<br />\nthe best scoring opportunity by<br />\neither team.<br />\nWhile the second half began<br />\nmuch like the first, the Blue Jays<br />\nbegan to take control of the game.<br />\nPlay moved entirely in the Juniata<br />\nhalf of the field as Hopkins<br />\nmanaged several shots. Midway<br />\nthrough the period Burner hit the<br />\noutside of the post with a hard<br /><br />\nshot. Juniata was having trouble<br />\nclearing their zone when senior<br />\nforward Jennifer Chun pushed a<br />\nsoft shot toward the goal.<br />\nAlthough the ball never reached<br />\nthe goal, the officials did call a<br />\npenalty corner. Chun sent the ball<br />\ninto play, and Burner again hit the<br />\npost.<br />\nWith the momentum building,<br />\nshots hitting posts, and<br />\ndominating play, it was only a<br />\nmatter of time. On the next penalty corner, Chun passed the ball<br />\ntoward Burner again, However,<br />\ninstead of stopping the ball for<br />\nBurner, senior mid-fielder and cocaptain Kathy Herring took the<br />\nshot herself. The shot was<br />\ndeflected by a Juniata defender,<br />\nbut sophomore forward Donna<br />\nWilliamson managed to control<br />\nthe ball and score from three<br />\nyards out giving Hopkins a 1-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nAfter several minutes of play<br />\nand the score still 1-0, Juniata<br />\nforced the ball into the Hopkins<br />\nhalf of the field, Juniata coach<br />\nKathi Quinn then pulled her<br />\ngoalie in favor of an extra<br />\nshooter. The Jays' defense led by<br />\nthe spirited play of senior Courtney DeVries was equal to the<br />\ntask. The extra player proved insignificant as Hopkins quickly<br />\ncleared the ball down the field<br />\nwhere it remained throughout the<br /><br />\ngame. Although the Jays did not<br />\ncapitalize on the empty net, they<br />\nkept solid pressure for the final<br />\nminutes of the game preventing<br />\nJuniata from getting out of their<br />\nown end of the field.<br />\nIn other notes, senior midfielder and co-captain Meredith<br />\nBlitz returned to play a full game<br />\nafter being knocked out of the<br />\nGettysburg contest. Freshman<br />\ndefender Sonia Dickson was on<br />\nthe sideline supporting her teammates after being hospitaliged<br /><br />\ncond in the South region behind<br />\nSalisbury State (where Hopkins<br />\nwill play Tuesday, October 2).<br />\nCatholic began the day ranked<br />\neighth in the South region.<br />\nThe Jays entered the game after<br />\nsix previous games and the<br />\nchance to work as a team was apparent in their play. While many<br />\nplayers had outstanding personal<br />\nperformances, none could match<br />\nthe play of freshman forward<br />\nBeth Cariello and sophmore goal<br />\nkeeper Alec King. Without their<br />\ncontributions the outcome of the<br />\ngame could have been significantly different.

My enthusiasm to hit the streets and examine some real life Hopkins injuries was tempered by my desire<br />\nto \"put a hurtin' on\" in another<br />\nsection of the News-Letter. Can<br />\nyou say bruised ego?<br />\nBut really folks, back to more<br />\nimportant matters. We have<br />\nanother boring, canned injury<br />\nfrom the sports medicine bible.<br />\nIt's one of those \"I don't know<br />\nwhat it feels like, but I must have<br />\nit\" jobs: tennis elbow. Incredibly, tennis elbow draws two<br />\npages of attention in the book's<br /><br />\n\"Common Injuries and What to<br />\nDo About Them\" section. Incidentally, now that you all know<br />\nmy secret, please don't go out and<br />\nread the book. You'll put me out<br />\nof a job. Tennis elbow results<br />\nfrom excessive strain on the<br />\nforearm muscles which attach at<br />\nthe elbow. There's forehand and<br />\nbackhand tennis elbow, and different racquets, court surfaces,<br />\nstring tension, and grip size apparently play some role. The<br />\ntaboo with tennis elbow is to have<br />\ntoo much wrist in your swing;<br />\nyou should have a smooth motion<br />\nwhich emphasizes upper arm<br />\nmovement. This is bad news for<br /><br />\nback-spin hacks like me. The only treatment for tennis elbow<br />\n(which can also result from bowling, pitching and cross-country<br />\nskiing. And to think they call it<br />\ntennis elbow) is rest followed by<br />\nstrengthening of the muscles in<br />\nthe area. By using our deductive<br />\npowers we can reason that tennis<br />\nelbow is essentially shin splints of<br />\nthe arm, or vice versa. Is this column insightful or what?

However, after some<br />\nconfusion and a brief conversation between the officials,<br />\nHopkins was given possession but did not receive points for<br />\nthe goal.
