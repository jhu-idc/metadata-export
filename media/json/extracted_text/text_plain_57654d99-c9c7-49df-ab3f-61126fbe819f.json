The lecture, as eloquent<br />\nand interesting as the preceding<br />\nones, continued the study of the<br />\nShakespeareen tragedies.<br />\nIn answer to a query as to the<br />\nreason for the dominance of the<br />\ntragedies over the comedies in<br />\nformer literature, Dr. Miles suggested two causes. The tragedy<br />\nstrikes a more stirring note as it<br />\nis more likely than comedy to occur in actual life. Also, one is<br />\nmore apt to exhibit the most ht.<br />\nteresting parts of his characters<br />\nwhen he is under the stress of<br />\ntrouble and sadness than he is<br />\nwhen in a light and carefree moment. Dr. Miles blames the<br />\nmovies as being the greatest<br />\ncause for 'the modern dislike for<br />\nunhappy endings.

The lecture, as eloquent<br />\nand interesting as the preceding<br />\nones, continued the study of the<br />\nShakespeareen tragedies.<br />\nIn answer to a query as to the<br />\nreason for the dominance of the<br />\ntragedies over the comedies in<br />\nformer literature, Dr. Miles suggested two causes. The tragedy<br />\nstrikes a more stirring note as it<br />\nis more likely than comedy to occur in actual life. Also, one is<br />\nmore apt to exhibit the most ht.<br />\nteresting parts of his characters<br />\nwhen he is under the stress of<br />\ntrouble and sadness than he is<br />\nwhen in a light and carefree moment. Dr. Miles blames the<br />\nmovies as being the greatest<br />\ncause for 'the modern dislike for<br />\nunhappy endings.
