Psychology and Political Economy.<br />\nSTUDIED DESEGREGATION<br />\nDuring its first year the Center was specifically concerned<br />\nwith the problem of desegregation and its effects on students<br />\nof varying racial and ethnic backgrounds. First-year studies included a study of the effects of<br />\nsimulation games on belief in<br />\none's ability to control one's<br />\nenvironment and a study of children's attitudes and values critical in the early school experience. Also studied were the<br />\nVerbal development of inner city<br />\nchildren, four projects involving<br />\na further analysis of the data<br />\ncollected for the Office of Education's survey EQUALITY OF<br />\nEDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY<br />\nand a study of desegregation<br />\nIn the Baltimore metropolitan<br />\narea since 1954.<br />\nThe last study, SCHOOL DESEGREGATION IN BALTIMORE<br />\nreceived widespred local attention. It was written by Dr.Dollie<br />\nWalker, of the Baltimore City<br />\nSchool System, and Dr. Arthur<br />\nStinchcombe and Mrs. Mary McDill, both of the Center, and<br />\nPublished this August. It stated<br />\n(inspite of integration programs)<br />\nthat the Baltimore Public School<br />\nSystem was becoming more segregated because of the exodus<br />\nof whites to the suburbs and the<br />\nensuing increase in the proportion of blacks to whites in urban<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore.

Both Sherwood and D'Alesandro will speak<br />\nt Hopkins during the campaign.<br />\n(See Page 2).<br />\nD'Alesandro. a member of an<br />\nOld Baltimore family anclson of<br />\na former mayor, has apparently<br />\nInherited the control of his father's forty-year-old powerful<br />\nDemocratic machine. For the<br />\nPast several years he has been<br />\nPresident of the City Council.<br />\nA Baltimore Lindsay<br />\nSherwood is a moderate RePublican, cast in the John Lindsay<br />\nmold.

He hopes to<br />\nclean up the Block, and combat<br />\npublic apathy to crime through<br />\nthe establishment of a \"Blockto -Block Plan,\" which would<br />\nprovide a neighborhood liaison<br />\nwith the local police precinct<br />\nto report disturbances.<br />\nThere will be a city-wide election for council, as well as the<br />\npost of mayor, President of City<br />\nCouncil. and Comptroller.

It is notable, however,<br />\nthat this year's scores show a<br />\nslight dropfrom those ofthe class<br />\nof 1970, for whereas the verbal<br />\nscore of 644 was the same,<br />\nthe math score was down 11<br />\npoints from last year. This<br />\ndifference \"is less than meaningful\", according to both Mr.<br />\nBilgrave and William L. Brinkley, the new Director of Admissions.<br />\nThirty-five states and the District of Columbia, as well as<br />\nseven foreign countries are represented in the class of 1971,<br />\nwith Maryland, as usual, leading<br />\nthe list with 157 of which 90 are<br />\ncommuting students. New York<br />\nwas second with 74 and New Jersey third with 40, both slight<br />\ndecreases from last year.<br />\n<br />\nistrators may have forced some<br />\nstudents to unwillingly purchase<br />\nhealth and accident insurance.<br />\nThis year, for the first time.the<br />\nUniversity offers an insurance<br />\nplan to which any full time student, graduate or undergraduate,<br />\nmay subscribe.<br />\nDuring the summer, the student body received a letter, signed by Mr. Bilgrave, notifying<br />\nthem of the existence and voluntary nature of the plan. In<br />\nSeptember, another letter was<br />\nreceived, signed by Mr. Jacob<br />\nR. Schlenger, Assistant Controller of the University, concerning an explanation of and instructions for completing an enclosed invoice. Only one item<br />\non the bill was not explained $23 for health insurance.<br />\nMr. Schlenger said that no<br />\noversight was involved. Rather,<br />\nthe invoice and the accompanying<br />\nletter were designed, in conjunction with the insurance company<br />\nas a means of insuring a high percentage of student participation.<br />\nThis type of billing is on a \"waiver basis\", and was instituted<br />\nas a policy decision of the faculty Personnel Benefits Committe. The waiver principle involves an extension of an offer to<br />\npurchase insurance on the besis.<br />\nthat people will accept it. ln<br />\nother words, as Mr. Rumberger,<br />\nDirector of Personnel Services,<br />\nsaid, the actual decision remains<br />\n\"non - mandatory\" instead of<br />\n\"voluntary.\"<br />\nAs reasons for the University's method of collection, Mr.<br />\nRumberger cited higher registration, which results in easier<br />\nadministration of the program<br />\nand lower rates for the subscribers.<br />\nPersonnel office files show that<br />\ncorrespondence was undertaken<br />\nwith a number of insurance corn-<br />\n<br />\npanies for the purpose ofsecuring<br />\nbids. According to Mr. Rumberger, the lowest bid and the best<br />\ncoverage were offered concurrently by the Guarantee Trust Life<br />\nInsurance Company of Chicago,<br />\nIllinois, the biggest in the field of<br />\nstudent insurance programs.The<br />\ncompany gavethe University a two<br />\nyear rate guarantee. As soon as<br />\nthe contract was signed.it became<br />\nbinding, whether two ortwothousand signed up.<br />\nThe coverage offered falls into<br />\ntwo categories: the base plan and<br />\nthe major medical. The base plan<br />\nprovides blanket accident coverage up to $1,000 which,according<br />\nto Mr. Rumberger, is tobe''applied as necessary to any medical<br />\nexpenses within the range of reimbursement.\" There is no categorical limitation on how the<br />\nmoney is to be spent. In the case<br />\nof illness, the $1,000 is specifically allocated for individual expenses. The major medical plan takes effect when the<br />\ncost of illness exceeds $1,000<br />\nand the student pays $100 in additional medical bills himself.<br />\nAt this time, the company is held<br />\nliable for 75% of additional expenses up to a maximum of $10,000.<br />\nAn unusual feature of this pro-,<br />\ngram is its coverage of rhental<br />\nillness and its availability to students' dependents.<br />\nIn the past, much thought has<br />\nbeen given to. student insurance<br />\nby the administration. Former<br />\nPresident Eisenhower. in response to numerous requests from<br />\nparents and graduate students,<br />\ninvestigations. Mr.<br />\ninitiated<br />\nRumberger, the man most directly responsible for conducting<br />\nthese investigations, points out<br />\nthat many universities make student coverage mandatory,but that<br />\nHopkins tradition dictated a free<br />\nand voluntary choice.<br />\n<br />\nPresidential Duties Keep<br />\nLincoln Gordon Busy<br />\nGuatemala Gives Rates University<br />\nHighest Ranking In First Address<br />\nDr. Lincoln Gordon, Hopkins<br />\nPresident, will be decorated with<br />\nthe Order of Quetzal in the rank<br />\nof Grand Cross,the highest award<br />\nconferred<br />\nby the Republic of<br />\nGuatemala.

Cooper<br />\n<br />\nJames N. Frank.<br />\n<br />\nWelcome<br />\nIn a speech to the incomingfreshmen last Saturday,<br />\nJohns Hopkins new president Lincoln Gordon compared his own position to the positions of the<br />\npersons he was speaking to, referring to himself<br />\nas \"a fellow freshman.\" Dr. Gordon comes to us<br />\nwith a long and distinguished record of political<br />\nand academic activity; and if any faith can be<br />\nplaced on the words of the Board of Trustees, he<br />\nis \"the one man who had the precise talents we<br />\nfelt were necessary to lead Johns Hopkins at this<br />\ncritical point in its history.\"<br />\nThe arrival of a new president in a university<br />\nas diverse and complex as Hopkins is bound to<br />\nelicit conjecture and comment from every area of<br />\nthe campus, and what we have seen here in the last<br />\ntwo weeks is no exception. Some people feel he will<br />\nbring a long needed dynamism which they say has<br />\nbeen lacking for years, others infer he who allegedly<br />\nmanipulated strings and attempted to overthrow a<br />\nfacist power in Brazil will use many of the same<br />\nmachinations here where student affairs are concerned.<br />\nWe wish to underscore the fact that Dr. Gordon,<br />\ndespite all the information he has skimmed from<br />\ntalking to every administrator and professor at<br />\nHopkins, is indeed a freshman. Never before has<br />\nhe been in a position where a combination of tact<br />\nand honesty must be used to placate and appease<br />\nsuch diverse voices as the students', the faculty's,<br />\nthe administration's and the trustees'. In his first<br />\npublic speech before a segment of the student body<br />\nlast week, Dr. Gordon used some unfortunate phrases\u2022<br />\nabout which not only students but even the BALTIMORE SUN showed concern.<br />\nIn a recent NEWS LETTER interview with Dr.<br />\nGordon (which will be printed in full in next week's<br />\nissue), the new president explained more fully and<br />\nmore understandingly what he meant by the \"aberration of the alienated\" and the \"aberration of<br />\ndirect action.\" He also explained that by \"constraints which must be enforced,\" he was not inferring that he plans to create new rules where<br />\nfew ever existed, nor does he plan to begin an indiscrimanate purge of all persons who have ever<br />\ntried marijuana or other mild drugs.<br />\nWe hope only that Dr. Gordon will peruse the<br />\nHopkins scene and will talk to many more students<br />\nas well as others here before launching any new<br />\npolicies involving students. We also hope that the new<br />\npresident, who is seemingly honest and willing to<br />\ntalk at length to anyone, will more carefully consider the connotations of what he says.<br />\nWe welcome you, President Gordon, and best of<br />\nluck in a difficult job.<br />\n<br />\nThe Insurance Caper<br />\nWhitehead Hall, the center of bureaucratic<br />\nburlesque at Hopkins, has done it again. This time,<br />\ninstead of taking money above and beyond the call<br />\nof duty in the bookstore, a few willful men have<br />\nsuceeded in easing twenty-three dollars a person<br />\nfrom the mass of Hopkins students for a supposedly<br />\noptional insurance plan.<br />\nWe hope that next time it will be made clear to<br />\nthe students that the insurance is indeed optional,<br />\nand that cleverly worded mimeographed letters<br />\nwill not be so misleading, and that the insurance<br />\nwill not appear together with tuition bills.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, SEPTEMBER 29, 1967<br />\n<br />\nFilm<br />\n<br />\nApple Conspiracy With Message<br />\nBy James Bennett<br />\n\"The War Game\" was a terribly graphic tale depicting the<br />\nhorrific aftermath of a nuclear<br />\ncataclysm. Peter Watkins who<br />\ndirected the tour de force in<br />\nEngland. received the warm<br />\nthanks of sane, peace-loving people everywhere. Those out for a<br />\nspine tingling encore will be<br />\ndisappointed if not indignant at<br />\nwatkin's latest effort, \"Privile5e\", which is currently screening at the 7 East theatre. Though<br />\ntouting the movie debut of Jean<br />\nS hrimpton, whose career only recently branched out from modeling to motion pictures, the lean<br />\nbeauty proves little more than<br />\nan ornamental piece in a pretty<br />\nhumdrum affair.<br />\nWatkins attempts a documentary collage in detailing the meteoric rise and fall of a young<br />\nsinging idol. The time, we are<br />\ninformed by a persistently obtrusive voice, is the \"not too<br />\ndistant future.\" Steve Shorter<br />\n(Paul Jones) has just received<br />\nthe first ticker tape reception in<br />\nthe history of the British Isles.<br />\nBut our hero, as we later learn,<br />\nhas not attained this unprecedented position of privilege unscathed. For surrounded by an<br />\nobsequious band of PR men and<br />\npersonal backers, Shorter must<br />\naccept a soul crushing existence.<br />\nWorst among the merciless group<br />\nis the young star's manager, Alvie, who brings to the screen a<br />\ndegree of unctuosity unheralded<br />\nsince the dancing days of Shirley Temple. Dangerously close<br />\nto the brink of despair (the viewer must be on his guard for Jones<br />\nwill toss in a few preliminary<br />\n<br />\nA rt<br />\n<br />\nlip contortions to confuse the<br />\nindiscriminate, but the wary will<br />\ncatch the clincher if he resists<br />\nbeing taken in by an hilarious<br />\nassortment of unconvincing winces) Shorter manages to momentarily assert himself with a few<br />\ntelevised \"I hate yous\" hurled<br />\nat the unfeeling masses. But alas,<br />\nthe damage has been done and<br />\none doubts if he will ever be<br />\nthat very private person Vanessa<br />\n(Jean Shrimpton) wants him to<br />\nbe.<br />\nAll of this sound tiresomely<br />\nfamiliar? Some may remember<br />\nback to the 50's when Jimmie<br />\nClanton went through it all in<br />\n\"Teenage Millionaire.\" But Peter watkins will not be satisfied with a simple tale of woe.<br />\nThe display of honest greed by<br />\nthe unscrupulous in their creation of a singing sensation is no<br />\nlonger by itself fashionable as<br />\nplot material. To it must be<br />\nadded the crass stupidity of a<br />\ngullible public, the dangers inherent in trying to present a<br />\nunified front against a rampant<br />\nCommunist ideology, a commentary on the perilous influence<br />\nof the communications media.<br />\nEnough for two hours of frivolity? Mr. Watkins thinks not.<br />\nBeneath it all there must run.a<br />\nmessage, something we can all<br />\nlatch onto for our own hurtian<br />\nbetterment. Yet, Steve must become Christ back to take another hack at it in a world utterly devoid of its \"spiritual<br />\nbearings.\" Now we see the august chairman of Steve Shorter<br />\nEnterprizes staring down from<br />\nhis apartment building(Hotel Sin-<br />\n<br />\nai?) at the tiny specks of people<br />\nwho dot the street below. The<br />\nyoung idol is at his side. \"They<br />\nhave to harnessed,\" the sapient<br />\ntycoon observes, \"guided to a<br />\nfruitful conformity.\"<br />\nDespite Watkins' often cumbersome symbolism, he does<br />\nmanage to occasionally extricate<br />\nhimself from the morass of entangling banalities and demonstrate real flashes of humour.<br />\nAs when Shorter, dressed as<br />\nthe good knight, prances in on<br />\nhis trusty steed to endorse the'<br />\ncurrent national crusade to eat<br />\nmore apples. Having taken several jaw puffing crunches into a<br />\nhard Macintosh the camera focusses in on the star's ambivalent expression. For one exquisite instant the lens captures<br />\nthe tragic figure of a lost boy<br />\nwho in this insane moment must<br />\nemote a fervent desire to down<br />\nhis six a day quota of apples<br />\nand love every bite of it.<br />\nThe musical score is refreshingly funny yet hauntingly beautiful - like the distant echo<br />\nfrom an abandoned catacomb. And<br />\nit is here, it seems to me, that<br />\nWatkins is most effective, parodying the senseless jabber of<br />\nthe rock cult. For the unpallatable wailings are soon forgotten.<br />\nIt is the pure sound that is unwittingly whistled the next day.<br />\nOne would hope that \"Privilege\"<br />\nsignals a departure for Peter<br />\nWatkins from the ostentatious<br />\ncommentary to a journey into<br />\nthe realm of comic satire. For<br />\nperhaps here he will unearth a<br />\ntruer sound buried beneath the<br />\nheavy moral overtones.<br />\n<br />\nHerman Maril: Involvement<br />\n13y<br />\n<br />\nDick Cramer<br />\n<br />\nSitting in a rocking chair,<br />\nlistening to Bach and holding a<br />\ncat named Lancelot; Herman Maril was in his studio, viewing<br />\nhis work. \"It's important to<br />\nlook over what you've done-to sit back and see if all the elements of the painting relate.\"<br />\nThere are 74 works in the Baltimore Museum of Art exhibit,<br />\nentitled \"The world Of Herman<br />\nMaril.\" At one time or another<br />\nMaril sat back and looked<br />\nat each of them \"to see if eiterything fits.\" He explained why<br />\nhis home also serves as a studio. \"I think about painting seven days a week: I'm totally involved. I like to come down to<br />\nmy studio during the evening, sit<br />\ndown and just look at my work.\"<br />\nHowever, Maril never paints<br />\nat night. He always works with<br />\nnatural light. \"And besides,\"<br />\nhe says, \"by night time I'm too<br />\n'tired to paint.\"<br />\nEXHIBITING IN HIS<br />\nHOME TOWN<br />\nMaril is from Baltimore<br />\nand his wife went to school here.<br />\nHe feels \"honored to have a show<br />\nand grateful to the museum for<br />\nthe opportunity. It's a challenge<br />\nto exhibit in my home town.\"<br />\nAt his home in the Mt. Washington<br />\narea<br />\nof Baltimore,<br />\nMaril has a small collection of<br />\nworks by other artists. His aquisitions are varied ( he calls them<br />\nhaphazard). \"I bought whatever<br />\nI liked or whatever I could afford<br />\nat the time.\"<br />\nIncluded in the collection are<br />\nlithographs from nineteenth century French newspapers, a<br />\nPersian illuminated manuscript<br />\nfrom the seventeenth century,<br />\nsome works of his friend,the late<br />\nByron Browne, some primitive<br />\nAfrican sculpture and his latest<br />\nfind, a South American marble<br />\nstatue of the rain god.

The building<br />\nwas once a post office, and was<br />\nfloated to its present location<br />\nover seventy years ago. There<br />\nis one large room and a small<br />\nthe<br />\nback. Maril<br />\nin<br />\nloft<br />\ninstalled a kitchen in the large<br />\nroom and made the loft into the<br />\nsleeping quarters. He and his<br />\nfamily usually spend the summer<br />\nmonths at the cape. \"I like<br />\nthe environment. You can carry<br />\na picture through the streets up<br />\nthere and not feel self-conscious.\"<br />\nMaril is 58 years old and<br />\nhas been painting as long as he<br />\ncan remember. \"It's always been<br />\nwhat I wanted to do.\" he explains.<br />\nHe teaches at the University of<br />\nMaryland and although he likes<br />\nteaching and \"being involved with<br />\nthe kids,\" he leaves his own work<br />\nonly grudgingly. Earlier, this<br />\nyear, when he broke his ankle,<br />\nhe spent seven weeks in a wheelchair. At first, \"it threw me as<br />\nI couldn't reach my large oils.\"<br />\nHe began working with paper,<br />\nusing casine, oils and ink until<br />\nhe could once again stand and<br />\nreach a canvas.<br />\nWhen he is not painting, he travels to New York, Philadelphia<br />\nand Washington.<br />\nHe says he<br />\nlikes Baltimore because it's<br />\nclose to everything. \"I can go to<br />\nNew York for a day just to look<br />\naround.<br />\nI'm in a good position<br />\nto see what's happening in the<br />\nworld of art.\"<br />\nNOT INTERESTED IN<br />\nPOP ART<br />\nBut not all that's happening<br />\nin the world interests Mr. Maril.<br />\n\"I'm not interested in Pop Art,\"<br />\nhe says. \"It just doesn't effect<br />\nme.

In one painting at the<br />\nB.M.A. exhibit, Maril has<br />\ncaptured the sea off of Cape Cod<br />\nand transformed it from a surging, moving, three dimensional<br />\nforce into a two dimensional object. \"Everything must be expressed,\" he says. \"in the language of the flat canvas and in<br />\nthe language of paint.\"<br />\nThe Maril exhibit is one of<br />\nmany important shows to be given at the Baltimore Museum of<br />\nArt, this year.

LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nUrge Hopkins Action<br />\nOn Baltimore's Decay<br />\nBy DAVID SCHNEIDERMAN<br />\nAmerica is facing a crisis.<br />\nHer cities are rapidly decaying<br />\nand nobody seems to know how to<br />\nreverse this frightening trend,<br />\nHopkins is facing a crisis.<br />\nBaltimore is decaying and she is<br />\nnot quite sure how to lend her<br />\nresources to the fight against<br />\nthe urban plight.<br />\nThe role of a University in<br />\nits own community, be it Middletown or Baltimore, has been<br />\nhotly debated by mayors, college<br />\npresidents, local politicans and<br />\nstudents. No one has yet devised<br />\na suitable answer to the problem.<br />\nHopkins role in Baltimore,<br />\nhowever, is easier to define, we<br />\nare located, for better or for<br />\nworse, in a city beset with the<br />\ntypical problems of urban America. The school system needs upgrading, crime is almost rampant<br />\nin certain areas of town, the<br />\nslums are as bad as any in the<br />\ncountry, and many of the local<br />\npoliticians only care at election<br />\ntime.<br />\nWith these numerous problems<br />\nIt seems obvious that an institution with the wealth and status of Hopkins can and should<br />\nplay a significant role in the<br />\ncity. But like the United States<br />\nGovernment, our resources are<br />\nlimited and we mUst concentrate<br />\nour efforts in those areas where<br />\nsome fruitful results may be<br />\nobtained.<br />\nA number of questions must be<br />\nconsidered before an institution<br />\nas large as Hopkins delves in-to the urban mess. First and<br />\nforemost is; how committed are<br />\nwe to solving these problems?<br />\nHalf-hearted measures are unacceptable. If we are to do something constructive, we must go all<br />\nthe way. Once we decide that we<br />\nare ready, willing and able to<br />\nmake the maximum efforts, it<br />\nis necessary to define the limits<br />\nand range of our resources.<br />\nIt is important to note that<br />\nthese resources are not necessarily monetary. In fact, manPower is a far more important<br />\nresource in fighting the problems of the city. And the greatest resource we have is the<br />\nstudent.<br />\nOne of the bulwarks of any<br />\nHopkins effort in Baltimore<br />\nShould be the students. For it<br />\nis the students of today who will<br />\nbe living in and administering<br />\nthe cities of tomorrow. Hopkins<br />\nmust interest the students in the<br />\nproblems of the city and even<br />\nmore so, get them to act.<br />\nIt is a safe bet that a large<br />\nnumber of Hopkins students have<br />\nnever seen a Harlem or watts.<br />\nThis is not reprehensible since<br />\nit takes more than initiati<br />\nve<br />\nto venture<br />\ninto one of these<br />\nareas. To ignore the proble<br />\nm<br />\nhowever and spend every one of<br />\n<br />\nyour waking hours in the comfortable confines of the Eisenhower library is totally inexcusible. To understand the crisis and be motivated to do something about it, one must get out<br />\ninto the \"field\". And, a course<br />\nin urban politics is not exactly<br />\na means of getting out in the<br />\n\"field.\"<br />\nThe Student Association of<br />\nHopkins has been sponsoring various community action programs<br />\nfor the past few years but the<br />\nresponse has been somewhat discouraging. The opportunities in<br />\nthe areas of tutoring and community work are unlimited. All<br />\nyou need is the desire to do<br />\nsomething.<br />\nAnother source of manpower<br />\nare the professors. It is pleasing<br />\nto note that the vast majority<br />\nof Hopkins professors are<br />\ninvolved in some type of activity involving the problems of<br />\nthe city.<br />\nThe role of the administration<br />\nIn this undertaking is twofold.<br />\nThe first is in the area of gentle but constant persuasion. The<br />\nUniversity should make every effort to encourage the students<br />\nto take an active role in the city.<br />\nAll the problems cannot be solved by quiet discourse on the<br />\nHomewood campus. To get the<br />\nstudents off Charles Street and<br />\ninto the area of the Inner City<br />\nwill take some discreet but persistent prodding. The faculty<br />\ncould play an enormous role<br />\nin this effort since most students<br />\nhave high respect for their teachers opinions.<br />\nThe second area of University<br />\naction should be major projects<br />\nformulated and directed by members of the administration and<br />\nfaculty. Hopkins is presently involved in numerous projects that<br />\nindicates that it's understanding<br />\nof our role in the community<br />\nand the city.The Homewood Community Project has been instituted to study the problems of the<br />\nsurrounding areas and find ways<br />\nto halt the trend of decay that<br />\nhas developed in the Homewood<br />\narea.<br />\nThe Hopkins summer program,<br />\ndirected by Victor Dates, though<br />\nsmall in scope, has enabled a<br />\nnumber of poor youngsters of the<br />\nghetto to receive the educational<br />\nand cultural training that they<br />\nnever would have gotten in the<br />\nInner City.<br />\nIn order for Hopkins to successfully tackle the problems of<br />\nBaltimore, the double-barrelled<br />\neffort of the administration and<br />\nthe students must be accelerated.<br />\nTime is running out for Baltimore and the rest of urban America. Something has to be done...<br />\nand fast.<br />\n<br />\nLyndon In The Sky<br />\nWord has been received from<br />\nreliable sources in Fun City<br />\nthat an even more potent<br />\nhallucinogen than either LSD or STP<br />\nhas been invente<br />\nd.

Established by the InterFraternity Council, the new regulations provide fof punishment<br />\nof freshmen caught in rushing<br />\nviolations and for freer contact<br />\nbetween brothers and freshmen.<br />\nl'he first innovation states that<br />\nIf the Judicial Board of the IFC<br />\nconvicts a freshman of a major<br />\nviolation, he will be blacklisted.<br />\na penalty which prohibits him<br />\nfrom pledging any fraternity and<br />\nfrom becoming involved in pledging activities for the remainder<br />\nof the academic year.<br />\nThe old rules had not been<br />\ncovering the situation adequately.<br />\nUnder them, if one fraternity, or<br />\ncertain members of one practiced<br />\nillegal rushing, the other fraternities felt that they must compete<br />\nand an escalation of dirty rushing<br />\nresulted. Now the freshmen<br />\nassume the risks that the fraternities previously abosrbed. In<br />\naddition, penalties have increased in serverity.<br />\nA house conviction of a major<br />\nviolation must either lose its<br />\n<br />\nfirst rush party following the conviction or pay a fine offrom $100$350. The definition of what constitutes a major violation has<br />\nbeen made harsher and a new one<br />\nhas been added. No rusher may<br />\nenter a freshman residence except during the designated times.<br />\nHowever it is now possible for<br />\na rusher to enter the freshman's<br />\nroom during those periods.<br />\nAnother important change is<br />\nthe result of a new attitude in the<br />\n'EC. The restrictions on conversations between freshmen and<br />\nbrothers have been relaxed; now<br />\nboth necessary and normal contact are allowed, although not<br />\nduring formal rush when only<br />\nnecessary discussion is permitted.<br />\nConversations concerning one<br />\nspecific fraternity are still prohibited, except during the alloted<br />\ntimes of formal rush. This<br />\nchange was made because the<br />\nIFC felt that the old regulations<br />\nwere unrealistic. They believed<br />\nthat a new student could not arrive at an accufate appraisal of<br />\nvarious houses during the three<br />\nshort weeks of formal ruSh.<br />\n<br />\nPAGE SEVEN<br />\n<br />\nDrama, Poetry, And Music<br />\nHighlight Goucher Series<br />\nEvlyn Williams, le celebrated<br />\nWelsh actor, will open Goucher<br />\nCollege's fourth season of onenight theater events when he<br />\nappears in \"Dylan Thomas Growing Up\" on October 20.

Immediately the<br />\ntwo occupants and some friends<br />\nattempted to put it out, using<br />\nthree extinguishers from the<br />\nhallway.<br />\nAt the same time, an alarm was<br />\nset off; and Mr. Peach, assistant<br />\nplant manager, was called at his<br />\nhome. In response, 12 to 14 trucks<br />\nrushed to the scene but found the<br />\nfire almost completely extinguished.<br />\nDamage was comparatively light, as only a desk, chair and bookshelf were destroyed along with<br />\n<br />\na number of books. One wall was<br />\nscorched by the blaze while a mattress was ruined because of water. Much of the damage has already been repaired with the floors being waxed, walls washed and renovation under way.<br />\nThe safety precautions employed by the school prevented<br />\nthe fire from spreading to other<br />\nrooms.

Tomorrow's result<br />\ncould supply a clue to the amount<br />\nof likely Jay improvement over<br />\nthe pattern of last season (06-2) and the three preceding it<br />\n(3-18-3 from '63 through '65).<br />\nSotir's strongest suit in efforts to revive J ay gridiron prowess is his desired starting offensive backfield - staffed by<br />\nMark Croft, Paul Weiss, Joe<br />\nCowan, and Jim Feely - a unit<br />\nshort on experience but possessed of much potential.<br />\nCroft, a 5-10, 185 pound junior who movee for 552 yards<br />\non 164 carries despite a bad<br />\nleg last season, will not play<br />\nSaturday due to a sprained arch.<br />\nHis fullback replacement, 5-7,<br />\n170 pound sophomore Dan Rosenfeld, started for the frosh last<br />\nfall.<br />\nAnother soph, tailback Weiss,<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\nFLUFF DRY & FOLD<br />\nSHIRTS-DRY CLEANING<br />\n<br />\nWaverly Laundromat<br />\n3330 GREENMOUNT AVE.<br />\n467-2123<br />\n<br />\ncould give the Jays the type of<br />\nbreak away threat mush lacking in<br />\nseasons past.The 5-11,190 pounder moved for 330 yards on 60<br />\ntries, scored 60 points, made at<br />\nleast two long kick returns, and<br />\nwas on the receiving end of several scoring tosses in three 1966<br />\nfreshman games. His other running mate, lacrosse All-American Joe Cowan,returns to the grid<br />\nwars after a three year layoff<br />\nand will fill the wingback slot<br />\nin Sotir's winged-T offense. As<br />\na freshman, the 5-10, 175 pound<br />\nstick standout averaged 9.1 yards<br />\nper carry on 281 yards in 31<br />\ntries, and - like Weiss - pulled<br />\noff several long gainers.<br />\n<br />\nFeely To Quarterback<br />\nQuarterback Feely, who finished the season at that spot a<br />\nyear ago, after opening at split<br />\nend completed 14 of 26 passes<br />\nfor 197 yards and two touchdowns<br />\nIn his two-game stint, and should<br />\nhave capable targets in the persons, of Cowan, Weiss, and tight<br />\nend Steve Latson (31 catches for<br />\n440 yards and two scores). The<br />\n5-8, 157 pound left-hander is<br />\nbacked by 5-10, 156 pound Mike<br />\nShaw (17 of 42 for 189), and 6-0,<br />\n175 pound soph Steve Clark.Other<br />\nbackfield possibilities are 5-9,<br />\n160 pound junior Will Scroggs<br />\n(44 carries, 154 yards, 3.5 average), soph Bob Hyde, junior Jeff<br />\nSienkiewicz, and 5-10, 170 pound<br />\nsenior Scott Black.<br />\nVETERAN LINE<br />\nThe offensive line, generally<br />\na veteran crew that learned its<br />\ntrade in last season's tough going,<br />\nconsists of lettermen guards John<br />\nPeck (a 5-11, 173 pound junior)<br />\nand Don Yablonowitz (6-0, 200,<br />\nJunior), tackle George Schrodel<br />\n(6-0, 195, junior), center Mark<br />\nPerimutter (6-1, 188, senior),<br />\nand ends Walt Sienkiewicz (6-2,<br />\n180, senior) and the 6-3, 218<br />\npound Latson. Joining this fairly<br />\ncapable, but hardly overpowering<br />\ngroup, is 6-2, 220 pound soph<br />\ntackle Mike Wlllbanks. Possible<br />\nreserves at the above spots include juniors Larry Daniels and<br />\nGay Pasternak and sophomores<br />\nDave Levien, Ed McGinnis, and<br />\nBill Nersesian.<br />\nThe defensive unit of Sotir's<br />\ntwo-platoon system is less solid<br />\nbut potentially as capable as its<br />\noffensive counterpart, since several promising but untested newcomers play key roles. The secondary, led by returning safeties Shaw and Sc.roggs, will also<br />\nfeature 5-8, 155 pound lacrosse<br />\nstandout Charley Coker and 5-11<br />\nsenior basketballer Dave Thomas<br />\n(both of whom have played no<br />\nfootball at Hopkins), and should<br />\nbe about as effective as the latter twosome makes it.<br />\nDEFENSIVE LINE UNCERTAIN<br />\nSotir's defensive front five,<br />\nhowever, probably ranks as the<br />\nmost uncertain set of spots on<br />\nhis club, but is also an area<br />\nwhose performers combine considerable size and some potential.

Psychology and Political Economy.<br />\nSTUDIED DESEGREGATION<br />\nDuring its first year the Center was specifically concerned<br />\nwith the problem of desegregation and its effects on students<br />\nof varying racial and ethnic backgrounds. First-year studies included a study of the effects of<br />\nsimulation games on belief in<br />\none's ability to control one's<br />\nenvironment and a study of children's attitudes and values critical in the early school experience. Also studied were the<br />\nVerbal development of inner city<br />\nchildren, four projects involving<br />\na further analysis of the data<br />\ncollected for the Office of Education's survey EQUALITY OF<br />\nEDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY<br />\nand a study of desegregation<br />\nIn the Baltimore metropolitan<br />\narea since 1954.<br />\nThe last study, SCHOOL DESEGREGATION IN BALTIMORE<br />\nreceived widespred local attention.

It stated<br />\n(inspite of integration programs)<br />\nthat the Baltimore Public School<br />\nSystem was becoming more segregated because of the exodus<br />\nof whites to the suburbs and the<br />\nensuing increase in the proportion of blacks to whites in urban<br /><br />\nBaltimore.

It is notable, however,<br />\nthat this year's scores show a<br />\nslight dropfrom those ofthe class<br />\nof 1970, for whereas the verbal<br />\nscore of 644 was the same,<br />\nthe math score was down 11<br />\npoints from last year.

In<br />\nSeptember, another letter was<br />\nreceived, signed by Mr. Jacob<br />\nR. Schlenger, Assistant Controller of the University, concerning an explanation of and instructions for completing an enclosed invoice. Only one item<br />\non the bill was not explained $23 for health insurance.<br />\nMr. Schlenger said that no<br />\noversight was involved. Rather,<br />\nthe invoice and the accompanying<br />\nletter were designed, in conjunction with the insurance company<br />\nas a means of insuring a high percentage of student participation.<br />\nThis type of billing is on a \"waiver basis\", and was instituted<br />\nas a policy decision of the faculty Personnel Benefits Committe. The waiver principle involves an extension of an offer to<br />\npurchase insurance on the besis.<br />\nthat people will accept it. ln<br />\nother words, as Mr. Rumberger,<br />\nDirector of Personnel Services,<br />\nsaid, the actual decision remains<br />\n\"non - mandatory\" instead of<br />\n\"voluntary.\"<br />\nAs reasons for the University's method of collection, Mr.<br />\nRumberger cited higher registration, which results in easier<br />\nadministration of the program<br />\nand lower rates for the subscribers.<br />\nPersonnel office files show that<br />\ncorrespondence was undertaken<br />\nwith a number of insurance corn-<br /><br />\npanies for the purpose ofsecuring<br />\nbids. According to Mr. Rumberger, the lowest bid and the best<br />\ncoverage were offered concurrently by the Guarantee Trust Life<br />\nInsurance Company of Chicago,<br />\nIllinois, the biggest in the field of<br />\nstudent insurance programs.The<br />\ncompany gavethe University a two<br />\nyear rate guarantee. As soon as<br />\nthe contract was signed.it became<br />\nbinding, whether two ortwothousand signed up.<br />\nThe coverage offered falls into<br />\ntwo categories: the base plan and<br />\nthe major medical. The base plan<br />\nprovides blanket accident coverage up to $1,000 which,according<br />\nto Mr. Rumberger, is tobe''applied as necessary to any medical<br />\nexpenses within the range of reimbursement.\" There is no categorical limitation on how the<br />\nmoney is to be spent. In the case<br />\nof illness, the $1,000 is specifically allocated for individual expenses. The major medical plan takes effect when the<br />\ncost of illness exceeds $1,000<br />\nand the student pays $100 in additional medical bills himself.<br />\nAt this time, the company is held<br />\nliable for 75% of additional expenses up to a maximum of $10,000.<br />\nAn unusual feature of this pro-,<br />\ngram is its coverage of rhental<br />\nillness and its availability to students' dependents.<br />\nIn the past, much thought has<br />\nbeen given to. student insurance<br />\nby the administration. Former<br />\nPresident Eisenhower. in response to numerous requests from<br />\nparents and graduate students,<br />\ninvestigations. Mr.<br />\ninitiated<br />\nRumberger, the man most directly responsible for conducting<br />\nthese investigations, points out<br />\nthat many universities make student coverage mandatory,but that<br />\nHopkins tradition dictated a free<br />\nand voluntary choice.<br /><br />\nPresidential Duties Keep<br />\nLincoln Gordon Busy<br />\nGuatemala Gives Rates University<br />\nHighest Ranking In First Address<br />\nDr. Lincoln Gordon, Hopkins<br />\nPresident, will be decorated with<br />\nthe Order of Quetzal in the rank<br />\nof Grand Cross,the highest award<br />\nconferred<br />\nby the Republic of<br />\nGuatemala.

Frank.<br /><br />\nWelcome<br />\nIn a speech to the incomingfreshmen last Saturday,<br />\nJohns Hopkins new president Lincoln Gordon compared his own position to the positions of the<br />\npersons he was speaking to, referring to himself<br />\nas \"a fellow freshman.\" Dr. Gordon comes to us<br />\nwith a long and distinguished record of political<br />\nand academic activity; and if any faith can be<br />\nplaced on the words of the Board of Trustees, he<br />\nis \"the one man who had the precise talents we<br />\nfelt were necessary to lead Johns Hopkins at this<br />\ncritical point in its history.\"<br />\nThe arrival of a new president in a university<br />\nas diverse and complex as Hopkins is bound to<br />\nelicit conjecture and comment from every area of<br />\nthe campus, and what we have seen here in the last<br />\ntwo weeks is no exception. Some people feel he will<br />\nbring a long needed dynamism which they say has<br />\nbeen lacking for years, others infer he who allegedly<br />\nmanipulated strings and attempted to overthrow a<br />\nfacist power in Brazil will use many of the same<br />\nmachinations here where student affairs are concerned.<br />\nWe wish to underscore the fact that Dr. Gordon,<br />\ndespite all the information he has skimmed from<br />\ntalking to every administrator and professor at<br />\nHopkins, is indeed a freshman. Never before has<br />\nhe been in a position where a combination of tact<br />\nand honesty must be used to placate and appease<br />\nsuch diverse voices as the students', the faculty's,<br />\nthe administration's and the trustees'. In his first<br />\npublic speech before a segment of the student body<br />\nlast week, Dr. Gordon used some unfortunate phrases\u2022<br />\nabout which not only students but even the BALTIMORE SUN showed concern.<br />\nIn a recent NEWS LETTER interview with Dr.<br />\nGordon (which will be printed in full in next week's<br />\nissue), the new president explained more fully and<br />\nmore understandingly what he meant by the \"aberration of the alienated\" and the \"aberration of<br />\ndirect action.\" He also explained that by \"constraints which must be enforced,\" he was not inferring that he plans to create new rules where<br />\nfew ever existed, nor does he plan to begin an indiscrimanate purge of all persons who have ever<br />\ntried marijuana or other mild drugs.<br />\nWe hope only that Dr. Gordon will peruse the<br />\nHopkins scene and will talk to many more students<br />\nas well as others here before launching any new<br />\npolicies involving students. We also hope that the new<br />\npresident, who is seemingly honest and willing to<br />\ntalk at length to anyone, will more carefully consider the connotations of what he says.<br />\nWe welcome you, President Gordon, and best of<br />\nluck in a difficult job.<br /><br />\nThe Insurance Caper<br />\nWhitehead Hall, the center of bureaucratic<br />\nburlesque at Hopkins, has done it again. This time,<br />\ninstead of taking money above and beyond the call<br />\nof duty in the bookstore, a few willful men have<br />\nsuceeded in easing twenty-three dollars a person<br />\nfrom the mass of Hopkins students for a supposedly<br />\noptional insurance plan.<br />\nWe hope that next time it will be made clear to<br />\nthe students that the insurance is indeed optional,<br />\nand that cleverly worded mimeographed letters<br />\nwill not be so misleading, and that the insurance<br />\nwill not appear together with tuition bills.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, SEPTEMBER 29, 1967<br /><br />\nFilm<br /><br />\nApple Conspiracy With Message<br />\nBy James Bennett<br />\n\"The War Game\" was a terribly graphic tale depicting the<br />\nhorrific aftermath of a nuclear<br />\ncataclysm. Peter Watkins who<br />\ndirected the tour de force in<br />\nEngland. received the warm<br />\nthanks of sane, peace-loving people everywhere. Those out for a<br />\nspine tingling encore will be<br />\ndisappointed if not indignant at<br />\nwatkin's latest effort, \"Privile5e\", which is currently screening at the 7 East theatre. Though<br />\ntouting the movie debut of Jean<br />\nS hrimpton, whose career only recently branched out from modeling to motion pictures, the lean<br />\nbeauty proves little more than<br />\nan ornamental piece in a pretty<br />\nhumdrum affair.<br />\nWatkins attempts a documentary collage in detailing the meteoric rise and fall of a young<br />\nsinging idol. The time, we are<br />\ninformed by a persistently obtrusive voice, is the \"not too<br />\ndistant future.\" Steve Shorter<br />\n(Paul Jones) has just received<br />\nthe first ticker tape reception in<br />\nthe history of the British Isles.<br />\nBut our hero, as we later learn,<br />\nhas not attained this unprecedented position of privilege unscathed. For surrounded by an<br />\nobsequious band of PR men and<br />\npersonal backers, Shorter must<br />\naccept a soul crushing existence.<br />\nWorst among the merciless group<br />\nis the young star's manager, Alvie, who brings to the screen a<br />\ndegree of unctuosity unheralded<br />\nsince the dancing days of Shirley Temple. Dangerously close<br />\nto the brink of despair (the viewer must be on his guard for Jones<br />\nwill toss in a few preliminary<br /><br />\nA rt<br /><br />\nlip contortions to confuse the<br />\nindiscriminate, but the wary will<br />\ncatch the clincher if he resists<br />\nbeing taken in by an hilarious<br />\nassortment of unconvincing winces) Shorter manages to momentarily assert himself with a few<br />\ntelevised \"I hate yous\" hurled<br />\nat the unfeeling masses. But alas,<br />\nthe damage has been done and<br />\none doubts if he will ever be<br />\nthat very private person Vanessa<br />\n(Jean Shrimpton) wants him to<br />\nbe.<br />\nAll of this sound tiresomely<br />\nfamiliar? Some may remember<br />\nback to the 50's when Jimmie<br />\nClanton went through it all in<br />\n\"Teenage Millionaire.\" But Peter watkins will not be satisfied with a simple tale of woe.<br />\nThe display of honest greed by<br />\nthe unscrupulous in their creation of a singing sensation is no<br />\nlonger by itself fashionable as<br />\nplot material. To it must be<br />\nadded the crass stupidity of a<br />\ngullible public, the dangers inherent in trying to present a<br />\nunified front against a rampant<br />\nCommunist ideology, a commentary on the perilous influence<br />\nof the communications media.<br />\nEnough for two hours of frivolity? Mr. Watkins thinks not.<br />\nBeneath it all there must run.a<br />\nmessage, something we can all<br />\nlatch onto for our own hurtian<br />\nbetterment. Yet, Steve must become Christ back to take another hack at it in a world utterly devoid of its \"spiritual<br />\nbearings.\" Now we see the august chairman of Steve Shorter<br />\nEnterprizes staring down from<br />\nhis apartment building(Hotel Sin-<br /><br />\nai?) at the tiny specks of people<br />\nwho dot the street below. The<br />\nyoung idol is at his side. \"They<br />\nhave to harnessed,\" the sapient<br />\ntycoon observes, \"guided to a<br />\nfruitful conformity.\"<br />\nDespite Watkins' often cumbersome symbolism, he does<br />\nmanage to occasionally extricate<br />\nhimself from the morass of entangling banalities and demonstrate real flashes of humour.<br />\nAs when Shorter, dressed as<br />\nthe good knight, prances in on<br />\nhis trusty steed to endorse the'<br />\ncurrent national crusade to eat<br />\nmore apples. Having taken several jaw puffing crunches into a<br />\nhard Macintosh the camera focusses in on the star's ambivalent expression. For one exquisite instant the lens captures<br />\nthe tragic figure of a lost boy<br />\nwho in this insane moment must<br />\nemote a fervent desire to down<br />\nhis six a day quota of apples<br />\nand love every bite of it.<br />\nThe musical score is refreshingly funny yet hauntingly beautiful - like the distant echo<br />\nfrom an abandoned catacomb. And<br />\nit is here, it seems to me, that<br />\nWatkins is most effective, parodying the senseless jabber of<br />\nthe rock cult. For the unpallatable wailings are soon forgotten.<br />\nIt is the pure sound that is unwittingly whistled the next day.<br />\nOne would hope that \"Privilege\"<br />\nsignals a departure for Peter<br />\nWatkins from the ostentatious<br />\ncommentary to a journey into<br />\nthe realm of comic satire. For<br />\nperhaps here he will unearth a<br />\ntruer sound buried beneath the<br />\nheavy moral overtones.<br /><br />\nHerman Maril: Involvement<br />\n13y<br /><br />\nDick Cramer<br /><br />\nSitting in a rocking chair,<br />\nlistening to Bach and holding a<br />\ncat named Lancelot; Herman Maril was in his studio, viewing<br />\nhis work. \"It's important to<br />\nlook over what you've done-to sit back and see if all the elements of the painting relate.\"<br />\nThere are 74 works in the Baltimore Museum of Art exhibit,<br />\nentitled \"The world Of Herman<br />\nMaril.\" At one time or another<br />\nMaril sat back and looked<br />\nat each of them \"to see if eiterything fits.\" He explained why<br />\nhis home also serves as a studio. \"I think about painting seven days a week: I'm totally involved. I like to come down to<br />\nmy studio during the evening, sit<br />\ndown and just look at my work.\"<br />\nHowever, Maril never paints<br />\nat night. He always works with<br />\nnatural light. \"And besides,\"<br />\nhe says, \"by night time I'm too<br />\n'tired to paint.\"<br />\nEXHIBITING IN HIS<br />\nHOME TOWN<br />\nMaril is from Baltimore<br />\nand his wife went to school here.<br />\nHe feels \"honored to have a show<br />\nand grateful to the museum for<br />\nthe opportunity. It's a challenge<br />\nto exhibit in my home town.\"<br />\nAt his home in the Mt. Washington<br />\narea<br />\nof Baltimore,<br />\nMaril has a small collection of<br />\nworks by other artists. His aquisitions are varied ( he calls them<br />\nhaphazard). \"I bought whatever<br />\nI liked or whatever I could afford<br />\nat the time.\"<br />\nIncluded in the collection are<br />\nlithographs from nineteenth century French newspapers, a<br />\nPersian illuminated manuscript<br />\nfrom the seventeenth century,<br />\nsome works of his friend,the late<br />\nByron Browne, some primitive<br />\nAfrican sculpture and his latest<br />\nfind, a South American marble<br />\nstatue of the rain god. This is<br />\nan example of pre-Columbian art<br />\nfrom the thirteenth century.<br />\nOWNS A CAPE COD<br />\nPOST OFFICE<br />\nBeside his home in Baltimore,<br /><br />\nMr. Maril owns a summer house<br />\nin Provincetown. The building<br />\nwas once a post office, and was<br />\nfloated to its present location<br />\nover seventy years ago. There<br />\nis one large room and a small<br />\nthe<br />\nback. Maril<br />\nin<br />\nloft<br />\ninstalled a kitchen in the large<br />\nroom and made the loft into the<br />\nsleeping quarters. He and his<br />\nfamily usually spend the summer<br />\nmonths at the cape. \"I like<br />\nthe environment. You can carry<br />\na picture through the streets up<br />\nthere and not feel self-conscious.\"<br />\nMaril is 58 years old and<br />\nhas been painting as long as he<br />\ncan remember. \"It's always been<br />\nwhat I wanted to do.\" he explains.<br />\nHe teaches at the University of<br />\nMaryland and although he likes<br />\nteaching and \"being involved with<br />\nthe kids,\" he leaves his own work<br />\nonly grudgingly. Earlier, this<br />\nyear, when he broke his ankle,<br />\nhe spent seven weeks in a wheelchair. At first, \"it threw me as<br />\nI couldn't reach my large oils.\"<br />\nHe began working with paper,<br />\nusing casine, oils and ink until<br />\nhe could once again stand and<br />\nreach a canvas.<br />\nWhen he is not painting, he travels to New York, Philadelphia<br />\nand Washington.<br />\nHe says he<br />\nlikes Baltimore because it's<br />\nclose to everything. \"I can go to<br />\nNew York for a day just to look<br />\naround.<br />\nI'm in a good position<br />\nto see what's happening in the<br />\nworld of art.\"<br />\nNOT INTERESTED IN<br />\nPOP ART<br />\nBut not all that's happening<br />\nin the world interests Mr. Maril.<br />\n\"I'm not interested in Pop Art,\"<br />\nhe says. \"It just doesn't effect<br />\nme.

In one painting at the<br />\nB.M.A. exhibit, Maril has<br />\ncaptured the sea off of Cape Cod<br />\nand transformed it from a surging, moving, three dimensional<br />\nforce into a two dimensional object. \"Everything must be expressed,\" he says. \"in the language of the flat canvas and in<br />\nthe language of paint.\"<br />\nThe Maril exhibit is one of<br />\nmany important shows to be given at the Baltimore Museum of<br />\nArt, this year.

LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nUrge Hopkins Action<br />\nOn Baltimore's Decay<br />\nBy DAVID SCHNEIDERMAN<br />\nAmerica is facing a crisis.<br />\nHer cities are rapidly decaying<br />\nand nobody seems to know how to<br />\nreverse this frightening trend,<br />\nHopkins is facing a crisis.<br />\nBaltimore is decaying and she is<br />\nnot quite sure how to lend her<br />\nresources to the fight against<br />\nthe urban plight.<br />\nThe role of a University in<br />\nits own community, be it Middletown or Baltimore, has been<br />\nhotly debated by mayors, college<br />\npresidents, local politicans and<br />\nstudents. No one has yet devised<br />\na suitable answer to the problem.<br />\nHopkins role in Baltimore,<br />\nhowever, is easier to define, we<br />\nare located, for better or for<br />\nworse, in a city beset with the<br />\ntypical problems of urban America. The school system needs upgrading, crime is almost rampant<br />\nin certain areas of town, the<br />\nslums are as bad as any in the<br />\ncountry, and many of the local<br />\npoliticians only care at election<br />\ntime.<br />\nWith these numerous problems<br />\nIt seems obvious that an institution with the wealth and status of Hopkins can and should<br />\nplay a significant role in the<br />\ncity. But like the United States<br />\nGovernment, our resources are<br />\nlimited and we mUst concentrate<br />\nour efforts in those areas where<br />\nsome fruitful results may be<br />\nobtained.<br />\nA number of questions must be<br />\nconsidered before an institution<br />\nas large as Hopkins delves in-to the urban mess. First and<br />\nforemost is; how committed are<br />\nwe to solving these problems?<br />\nHalf-hearted measures are unacceptable. If we are to do something constructive, we must go all<br />\nthe way. Once we decide that we<br />\nare ready, willing and able to<br />\nmake the maximum efforts, it<br />\nis necessary to define the limits<br />\nand range of our resources.<br />\nIt is important to note that<br />\nthese resources are not necessarily monetary. In fact, manPower is a far more important<br />\nresource in fighting the problems of the city. And the greatest resource we have is the<br />\nstudent.<br />\nOne of the bulwarks of any<br />\nHopkins effort in Baltimore<br />\nShould be the students. For it<br />\nis the students of today who will<br />\nbe living in and administering<br />\nthe cities of tomorrow. Hopkins<br />\nmust interest the students in the<br />\nproblems of the city and even<br />\nmore so, get them to act.<br />\nIt is a safe bet that a large<br />\nnumber of Hopkins students have<br />\nnever seen a Harlem or watts.<br />\nThis is not reprehensible since<br />\nit takes more than initiati<br />\nve<br />\nto venture<br />\ninto one of these<br />\nareas. To ignore the proble<br />\nm<br />\nhowever and spend every one of<br /><br />\nyour waking hours in the comfortable confines of the Eisenhower library is totally inexcusible. To understand the crisis and be motivated to do something about it, one must get out<br />\ninto the \"field\". And, a course<br />\nin urban politics is not exactly<br />\na means of getting out in the<br />\n\"field.\"<br />\nThe Student Association of<br />\nHopkins has been sponsoring various community action programs<br />\nfor the past few years but the<br />\nresponse has been somewhat discouraging. The opportunities in<br />\nthe areas of tutoring and community work are unlimited. All<br />\nyou need is the desire to do<br />\nsomething.<br />\nAnother source of manpower<br />\nare the professors. It is pleasing<br />\nto note that the vast majority<br />\nof Hopkins professors are<br />\ninvolved in some type of activity involving the problems of<br />\nthe city.<br />\nThe role of the administration<br />\nIn this undertaking is twofold.<br />\nThe first is in the area of gentle but constant persuasion. The<br />\nUniversity should make every effort to encourage the students<br />\nto take an active role in the city.<br />\nAll the problems cannot be solved by quiet discourse on the<br />\nHomewood campus. To get the<br />\nstudents off Charles Street and<br />\ninto the area of the Inner City<br />\nwill take some discreet but persistent prodding. The faculty<br />\ncould play an enormous role<br />\nin this effort since most students<br />\nhave high respect for their teachers opinions.<br />\nThe second area of University<br />\naction should be major projects<br />\nformulated and directed by members of the administration and<br />\nfaculty. Hopkins is presently involved in numerous projects that<br />\nindicates that it's understanding<br />\nof our role in the community<br />\nand the city.The Homewood Community Project has been instituted to study the problems of the<br />\nsurrounding areas and find ways<br />\nto halt the trend of decay that<br />\nhas developed in the Homewood<br />\narea.<br />\nThe Hopkins summer program,<br />\ndirected by Victor Dates, though<br />\nsmall in scope, has enabled a<br />\nnumber of poor youngsters of the<br />\nghetto to receive the educational<br />\nand cultural training that they<br />\nnever would have gotten in the<br />\nInner City.<br />\nIn order for Hopkins to successfully tackle the problems of<br />\nBaltimore, the double-barrelled<br />\neffort of the administration and<br />\nthe students must be accelerated.<br />\nTime is running out for Baltimore and the rest of urban America.

Established by the InterFraternity Council, the new regulations provide fof punishment<br />\nof freshmen caught in rushing<br />\nviolations and for freer contact<br />\nbetween brothers and freshmen.<br />\nl'he first innovation states that<br />\nIf the Judicial Board of the IFC<br />\nconvicts a freshman of a major<br />\nviolation, he will be blacklisted.<br />\na penalty which prohibits him<br />\nfrom pledging any fraternity and<br />\nfrom becoming involved in pledging activities for the remainder<br />\nof the academic year.<br />\nThe old rules had not been<br />\ncovering the situation adequately.<br />\nUnder them, if one fraternity, or<br />\ncertain members of one practiced<br />\nillegal rushing, the other fraternities felt that they must compete<br />\nand an escalation of dirty rushing<br />\nresulted. Now the freshmen<br />\nassume the risks that the fraternities previously abosrbed. In<br />\naddition, penalties have increased in serverity.<br />\nA house conviction of a major<br />\nviolation must either lose its<br /><br />\nfirst rush party following the conviction or pay a fine offrom $100$350. The definition of what constitutes a major violation has<br />\nbeen made harsher and a new one<br />\nhas been added. No rusher may<br />\nenter a freshman residence except during the designated times.<br />\nHowever it is now possible for<br />\na rusher to enter the freshman's<br />\nroom during those periods.<br />\nAnother important change is<br />\nthe result of a new attitude in the<br />\n'EC. The restrictions on conversations between freshmen and<br />\nbrothers have been relaxed; now<br />\nboth necessary and normal contact are allowed, although not<br />\nduring formal rush when only<br />\nnecessary discussion is permitted.<br />\nConversations concerning one<br />\nspecific fraternity are still prohibited, except during the alloted<br />\ntimes of formal rush. This<br />\nchange was made because the<br />\nIFC felt that the old regulations<br />\nwere unrealistic. They believed<br />\nthat a new student could not arrive at an accufate appraisal of<br />\nvarious houses during the three<br />\nshort weeks of formal ruSh.<br /><br />\nPAGE SEVEN<br /><br />\nDrama, Poetry, And Music<br />\nHighlight Goucher Series<br />\nEvlyn Williams, le celebrated<br />\nWelsh actor, will open Goucher<br />\nCollege's fourth season of onenight theater events when he<br />\nappears in \"Dylan Thomas Growing Up\" on October 20.

The blaze was<br />\ncontained within one room. Wilson 301, occupied by Richard<br />\nMoss and William Smith.<br />\nThe cause of the fire was traced to a hot plate which had-been<br />\nleft on for several hours while<br />\nthe students were out of the room.<br />\nWhen they returned, the fire was<br />\nalready raging. Immediately the<br />\ntwo occupants and some friends<br />\nattempted to put it out, using<br />\nthree extinguishers from the<br />\nhallway.<br />\nAt the same time, an alarm was<br />\nset off; and Mr. Peach, assistant<br />\nplant manager, was called at his<br />\nhome. In response, 12 to 14 trucks<br />\nrushed to the scene but found the<br />\nfire almost completely extinguished.<br />\nDamage was comparatively light, as only a desk, chair and bookshelf were destroyed along with<br /><br />\na number of books. One wall was<br />\nscorched by the blaze while a mattress was ruined because of water.

The Diplomats, a .500 ballclub which<br />\nwas tied 14-14 by the Jays in '60,<br />\nshould be roughly as strong this<br />\ntime around. Tomorrow's result<br />\ncould supply a clue to the amount<br />\nof likely Jay improvement over<br />\nthe pattern of last season (06-2) and the three preceding it<br />\n(3-18-3 from '63 through '65).<br />\nSotir's strongest suit in efforts to revive J ay gridiron prowess is his desired starting offensive backfield - staffed by<br />\nMark Croft, Paul Weiss, Joe<br />\nCowan, and Jim Feely - a unit<br />\nshort on experience but possessed of much potential.<br />\nCroft, a 5-10, 185 pound junior who movee for 552 yards<br />\non 164 carries despite a bad<br />\nleg last season, will not play<br />\nSaturday due to a sprained arch.<br />\nHis fullback replacement, 5-7,<br />\n170 pound sophomore Dan Rosenfeld, started for the frosh last<br />\nfall.<br />\nAnother soph, tailback Weiss,<br /><br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\nFLUFF DRY &amp; FOLD<br />\nSHIRTS-DRY CLEANING<br /><br />\nWaverly Laundromat<br />\n3330 GREENMOUNT AVE.<br />\n467-2123<br /><br />\ncould give the Jays the type of<br />\nbreak away threat mush lacking in<br />\nseasons past.The 5-11,190 pounder moved for 330 yards on 60<br />\ntries, scored 60 points, made at<br />\nleast two long kick returns, and<br />\nwas on the receiving end of several scoring tosses in three 1966<br />\nfreshman games. His other running mate, lacrosse All-American Joe Cowan,returns to the grid<br />\nwars after a three year layoff<br />\nand will fill the wingback slot<br />\nin Sotir's winged-T offense. As<br />\na freshman, the 5-10, 175 pound<br />\nstick standout averaged 9.1 yards<br />\nper carry on 281 yards in 31<br />\ntries, and - like Weiss - pulled<br />\noff several long gainers.<br /><br />\nFeely To Quarterback<br />\nQuarterback Feely, who finished the season at that spot a<br />\nyear ago, after opening at split<br />\nend completed 14 of 26 passes<br />\nfor 197 yards and two touchdowns<br />\nIn his two-game stint, and should<br />\nhave capable targets in the persons, of Cowan, Weiss, and tight<br />\nend Steve Latson (31 catches for<br />\n440 yards and two scores). The<br />\n5-8, 157 pound left-hander is<br />\nbacked by 5-10, 156 pound Mike<br />\nShaw (17 of 42 for 189), and 6-0,<br />\n175 pound soph Steve Clark.Other<br />\nbackfield possibilities are 5-9,<br />\n160 pound junior Will Scroggs<br />\n(44 carries, 154 yards, 3.5 average), soph Bob Hyde, junior Jeff<br />\nSienkiewicz, and 5-10, 170 pound<br />\nsenior Scott Black.<br />\nVETERAN LINE<br />\nThe offensive line, generally<br />\na veteran crew that learned its<br />\ntrade in last season's tough going,<br />\nconsists of lettermen guards John<br />\nPeck (a 5-11, 173 pound junior)<br />\nand Don Yablonowitz (6-0, 200,<br />\nJunior), tackle George Schrodel<br />\n(6-0, 195, junior), center Mark<br />\nPerimutter (6-1, 188, senior),<br />\nand ends Walt Sienkiewicz (6-2,<br />\n180, senior) and the 6-3, 218<br />\npound Latson. Joining this fairly<br />\ncapable, but hardly overpowering<br />\ngroup, is 6-2, 220 pound soph<br />\ntackle Mike Wlllbanks. Possible<br />\nreserves at the above spots include juniors Larry Daniels and<br />\nGay Pasternak and sophomores<br />\nDave Levien, Ed McGinnis, and<br />\nBill Nersesian.<br />\nThe defensive unit of Sotir's<br />\ntwo-platoon system is less solid<br />\nbut potentially as capable as its<br />\noffensive counterpart, since several promising but untested newcomers play key roles. The secondary, led by returning safeties Shaw and Sc.roggs, will also<br />\nfeature 5-8, 155 pound lacrosse<br />\nstandout Charley Coker and 5-11<br />\nsenior basketballer Dave Thomas<br />\n(both of whom have played no<br />\nfootball at Hopkins), and should<br />\nbe about as effective as the latter twosome makes it.<br />\nDEFENSIVE LINE UNCERTAIN<br />\nSotir's defensive front five,<br />\nhowever, probably ranks as the<br />\nmost uncertain set of spots on<br />\nhis club, but is also an area<br />\nwhose performers combine considerable size and some potential. The expected starters 6-1, 173 pound senior Dave Komocki (who did not play in '66<br />\nand was a reserve two seasons<br />\nago); 6-2, 248 pound junior Edwin Holden (no J.H.U. grid experience); and sophomores Ken<br />\nBrown (6-4, 215), Jim Lotto(6-0,<br />\n205), and Brian Turner (6-5,<br />\n205 and also no Hopkins grid<br />\nexperience) - average 209 pounds<br />\nper man and should improve as<br />\nthe year wears on.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40238, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "36af54c3-b896-414d-8d7f-f7eed19ed58c", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13933-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13933, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "9e2bd45f-abf8-40e9-a432-51f39e85935c", "url": "/node/13933"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "906df4d9-0afe-45ff-96c6-bd0d8816641d"}]}
