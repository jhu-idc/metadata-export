Hollis, Stephen Tulloss<br />\n<br />\nBenton 's Revelation<br />\nAmidst pompous chatter about an open university<br />\ncomes Dean Benton's revelation of a \"long-standing\"<br />\nUniversity policy barring on-campus solicitation by nonmembers of the community including distributing<br />\nliterature, fundraising and petitioning. Community<br />\nmembers, Benton added, though allowed to hand out<br />\nliterature, are prohibited from \"door-to-door\" funddraising on campus. The dean says he wants to formalize the policy and has brought the matter up before<br />\nthe Temporary Advisory Council.<br />\nTo forbid hawking or passing out literature on the<br />\ncampus for political, religious or social causes, be it the<br />\nBlack Panthers, Hari Krishna, HARRY or the John<br />\nBirch Society, clearly violates a university's very spirit<br />\nof free-flowing, open dialogue. In recent weeks, several<br />\nsalesmen of the Black Panther Party newspaper have<br />\nbeen asked to leave the campus for violation of the<br />\nsoliciting regulations. Student fundraising, according to<br />\nthe dean, must now be cleared by the Office of Student<br />\nAffairs before a booth is set up. The reason, Benton<br />\nintimated, is that since the campus is private property,<br />\nHopkins can do with it what it pleases--or, in other<br />\nwords, everyone except the administration be damned.<br />\nMembers of the community should be allowed the<br />\nfreedom to decide whether they want to contribute to an<br />\norganization or read its literature. The rationale of<br />\nuniversity private property has too long impeded independent thought. It is one thing to prohibit solicitation<br />\nfor pure profit (such as church raffles) and another to<br />\nforbid fundraising, petitioning and distributing<br />\nliterature by outside organizations.<br />\nWe call upon the TAC to reject the dean's soliciting<br />\nban.<br />\n<br />\nAttend the Hearings<br />\nUndergraduates are the silent majority on campus.<br />\nFinally someone is thinking about our welfare in the<br />\nform of Professor Lynn's proposal for a separate<br />\nHomewood college.

There are<br />\nreasons why this is so.<br />\nFor one thing the tone of commentary on<br />\narchitecture was established in the 1930's by<br />\nthe historians and journalists who<br />\nsurrounded the insurgent avant-garde architects. The practitioners of the Modern<br />\nMovement and the apostles of the International Style fought their way to<br />\nprominence by exposing the fallibilities of<br />\nthe traditionalism they set out to supplant<br />\nwith their own fresh ideas.<br />\nTheir arguments were persuasive and<br />\ntheir resolution to reform was steadfast<br />\nbecause they were sure a new and better<br />\nstyle had been born. Its acceptance would,<br />\nthey asserted, cure a host of artistic and<br />\nsocial ills.<br />\n<br />\nThe bright new world of influential<br />\nbuildings they promised has not<br />\nmaterialized. About 1950 architecture began<br />\nto change as the modern movement went<br />\ninto a less rational Expressionist phase.<br />\nNobody for a moment fancies that these<br />\nbuildings will reform society, although they<br />\ndo reflect its concerns.<br />\nAll this is applicable to the consideration of<br />\nGarland Hall. Its style and the bearing of its<br />\ncritics represent in micrososm the questions<br />\nwithout answers architecture has today<br />\npresented to itself.<br />\nGarland Hall appears to me to be a not<br />\nvery distinguished design in the new post<br />\n1950 modern mode. More about it later.

The<br />\nchoice of design was obviously central, for the new<br />\nwould have to associate with<br />\nthe older buildings and it<br />\nwould presumably dictate the<br />\nform of other new buildings to<br />\nfollow.<br />\nThe columnar appearance<br />\nof the elevations of Garland<br />\nHall, the choice of brick and<br />\nits bond, the color contrast<br />\nbetween the brick and the<br />\nstone of the cornice and the<br />\nmolding which divides the<br />\nupper and lower tiers of<br />\nwindows, the rectangularity<br />\nof the mass and the podium<br />\non which it stands derive<br />\nfrom but do not copy the neoGeorgian architecture of the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nBut the limited number of<br />\nthe shapes employed, their<br />\ntheir<br />\nand<br />\nproportions<br />\ncharacter. . .each is heavy,<br />\nbulky, angular. . .identify the<br />\nbuilding as a member of the<br />\nstyle family of the 1960's.<br />\nLike other members of that<br />\nfamily it is arbitrary, based<br />\non design preferences and the<br />\ndiscretion of the architect<br />\nrather than on even a titular<br />\nstatement of function in<br />\ndesign.<br />\nOne can well ask why the<br />\nrising fins on the elevations<br />\nare angular rather than<br />\ncircular in section like the<br />\nduct-work they contain. The<br />\nmetal, sloping roof, about<br />\n<br />\nwhich I have heard adverse<br />\ncomment, is in fact a<br />\nprotection and visual disguise<br />\nfor mechancial equipment.<br />\nMost buildings today wear<br />\nsuch millinery: the dark top<br />\nstories of 1 Charles Center<br />\nand the Blaustein Building<br />\ndowntown house a mass of<br />\nairconditioning apparatus. In<br />\na building the size of Garland<br />\nHall it is merely more obvious.<br />\nThe decision to rake the<br />\nsides of the box was,<br />\nhowever, another one of those<br />\narbitrary design decisions. I<br />\nwould also query the use of a<br />\nmetal rather than a cast stone<br />\ncovering. Had the podium,<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\ncornice<br />\nthe<br />\nmechanical receptacle all<br />\nbeen of one material they<br />\nwould surely have composed<br />\na pleasing unity.<br />\nWith the building still<br />\nunfinished it is difficult to see<br />\njust how the duct work at<br />\nceiling level in the interior<br />\nwill be screened from view<br />\nthrough the windows where it<br />\nis now visible.<br />\nMr. John McElwee, Plant<br />\nPlanning, has kindly let me<br />\nlook at the plans and explained that the ceilings of the<br />\ninterior will be dropped some<br />\ninches behind the glass to<br />\ncreate a screen and form an<br />\nembrasure for draperies.<br />\nHe also explained that the<br />\nexterior panels now covered<br />\nwith a protective material<br />\nwill be dark in color.<br />\nThis will, it is obvious, pull<br />\nthe windows of the first and<br />\nsecond stories into tall units<br />\nwhich will parallel the<br />\ncolumnar theme of the<br />\ncomposition of the sides.<br />\nIt seems to me that the<br />\nsiting of the building is more<br />\nimportant than the particulars of its design. Had<br />\nGarland Hall been built, for<br />\nexample, with its back in the<br />\ntrees where the Wyman<br />\nHouse once stood and the<br />\nparking lot now is, it would<br />\nhave acquired poise, for its<br />\nlines and color would have<br />\nrelated well to the grove.<br />\nIn these impecunious days<br />\nexpensive buildings seem<br />\nirresponsible but it is still<br />\npossible to acquire a sensitive<br />\nBOOK FAIR<br />\n<br />\n\"A squid eating dough in a<br />\n<br />\npolyethylene bag is fast 'n bulbous.<br />\ngot me?\"<br />\n<br />\n32nd and St. Paul<br />\nPaperback Books<br />\nHallmark Cards<br />\nGifts & Candles<br />\nOpen Mon-Sat. 9:30-9:00<br />\n<br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\n11111111111111111111111111111111111<br />\n<br />\nTONIGHT!<br />\nJohns Hopkins Union Memorial Nursing School<br />\n\"RAP\"<br />\nRefreshments<br />\nMusic<br />\n7:30 to 9:00<br />\nNewman House<br />\n<br />\n2941 N.

Opus 31, no.2; the<br />\nSonata in E flat major, Opus<br />\n31, no. 3; two Bagatelles in B<br />\nflat major and C major; the<br />\nAllegretto in b minor; and<br />\nfinally, the Sonata in c minor,<br />\nOpus 111.<br />\nAfter all the advance<br />\nHall<br />\npublicity, Shriver<br />\npatrons were probably expecting a pianist with a<br />\nsuperb technique, tremendous control, and great<br />\nsensitivity. After all, the<br />\nthirty year old Bishop did<br />\nstudy with the late Dame<br />\n<br />\nMyra Hess.<br />\nInstead, what transpired<br />\nbetween Mr. Bishop and the<br />\nkeyboard was mediocre at<br />\nbest, and thoroughly unmusical at worst.<br />\nWhile Bishop's technique<br />\nseems to be adequate, he<br />\nlacks a great deal of control<br />\nover the tone he produces. His<br />\ntouch was extremely percussive. even in places<br />\nrequiring pianissimo playing.<br />\nBishop just seemed unwilling<br />\nand maybe unable to play<br />\ntruly softly, and there was not<br />\neven a hint of whether he<br />\ncould play \"cantibile\".,<br />\nsomething which is a must for<br />\nBeethoven.<br />\nTo make matters worse,<br />\nMr. Bishop attempted several<br />\npieces of music that seemed<br />\nslightly out of his grasp. A<br />\ngood example is the first<br />\nwork on the program, the<br />\nSonata in d minor, Opus 31,<br />\n<br />\n_----SLOW:047(88<br />\n<br />\n/)<br />\n<br />\nee<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n0,<br />\n<br />\nTest-orive ii<br />\njust tar tun<br />\nGo Anywhere/Any Time<br />\nwith 4-Wheel Drive<br />\n<br />\nJoe<br />\n<br />\nII1<br />\n4 WHEEL DRIVEP<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\n2car<br />\ncar<br />\n<br />\nHERRING JEEP<br />\n<br />\n310 W. 27<br />\n889-1719<br />\n<br />\n14.<br />\n<br />\nduitipcAp<br />\n.<br />\n.7<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n...-<br />\n<br />\nUniversal<br />\n<br />\nno. 2.<br />\n\"Tempest\"<br />\nBishop's<br />\nSonata was full of harshness<br />\nand unwarranted rhythmic<br />\nvariations.

Hollis, Stephen Tulloss<br /><br />\nBenton 's Revelation<br />\nAmidst pompous chatter about an open university<br />\ncomes Dean Benton's revelation of a \"long-standing\"<br />\nUniversity policy barring on-campus solicitation by nonmembers of the community including distributing<br />\nliterature, fundraising and petitioning. Community<br />\nmembers, Benton added, though allowed to hand out<br />\nliterature, are prohibited from \"door-to-door\" funddraising on campus. The dean says he wants to formalize the policy and has brought the matter up before<br />\nthe Temporary Advisory Council.<br />\nTo forbid hawking or passing out literature on the<br />\ncampus for political, religious or social causes, be it the<br />\nBlack Panthers, Hari Krishna, HARRY or the John<br />\nBirch Society, clearly violates a university's very spirit<br />\nof free-flowing, open dialogue. In recent weeks, several<br />\nsalesmen of the Black Panther Party newspaper have<br />\nbeen asked to leave the campus for violation of the<br />\nsoliciting regulations. Student fundraising, according to<br />\nthe dean, must now be cleared by the Office of Student<br />\nAffairs before a booth is set up. The reason, Benton<br />\nintimated, is that since the campus is private property,<br />\nHopkins can do with it what it pleases--or, in other<br />\nwords, everyone except the administration be damned.<br />\nMembers of the community should be allowed the<br />\nfreedom to decide whether they want to contribute to an<br />\norganization or read its literature. The rationale of<br />\nuniversity private property has too long impeded independent thought. It is one thing to prohibit solicitation<br />\nfor pure profit (such as church raffles) and another to<br />\nforbid fundraising, petitioning and distributing<br />\nliterature by outside organizations.<br />\nWe call upon the TAC to reject the dean's soliciting<br />\nban.<br /><br />\nAttend the Hearings<br />\nUndergraduates are the silent majority on campus.<br />\nFinally someone is thinking about our welfare in the<br />\nform of Professor Lynn's proposal for a separate<br />\nHomewood college.

There are<br />\nreasons why this is so.<br />\nFor one thing the tone of commentary on<br />\narchitecture was established in the 1930's by<br />\nthe historians and journalists who<br />\nsurrounded the insurgent avant-garde architects. The practitioners of the Modern<br />\nMovement and the apostles of the International Style fought their way to<br />\nprominence by exposing the fallibilities of<br />\nthe traditionalism they set out to supplant<br />\nwith their own fresh ideas.<br />\nTheir arguments were persuasive and<br />\ntheir resolution to reform was steadfast<br />\nbecause they were sure a new and better<br />\nstyle had been born. Its acceptance would,<br />\nthey asserted, cure a host of artistic and<br />\nsocial ills.<br /><br />\nThe bright new world of influential<br />\nbuildings they promised has not<br />\nmaterialized. About 1950 architecture began<br />\nto change as the modern movement went<br />\ninto a less rational Expressionist phase.<br />\nNobody for a moment fancies that these<br />\nbuildings will reform society, although they<br />\ndo reflect its concerns.<br />\nAll this is applicable to the consideration of<br />\nGarland Hall. Its style and the bearing of its<br />\ncritics represent in micrososm the questions<br />\nwithout answers architecture has today<br />\npresented to itself.<br />\nGarland Hall appears to me to be a not<br />\nvery distinguished design in the new post<br />\n1950 modern mode. More about it later. Its<br />\ncritics who are importuning the University<br />\nto produce exciting, vigorous architecture<br />\nwhich people will come to the campus to see,<br />\nare speaking in the tones of the 30's.<br />\nThat sort of certainty went out of fashion<br />\nyears ago as even the readers of Time<br />\n(September 21, 1970, p.76 ff \"The Campus:<br />\nArchitecture's Show Place\") will know.<br />\nAt the risk of sounding like a chattering,<br />\nconservative old lady in tennis shoes I must<br />\nsay that I find some of the freeform artistic<br />\nhyperbole illustrated in Time expensive to<br />\nthe point of irresponsibility, too assertive<br />\nand, unless a whole new campus is being<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour laughably pathetic<br />\neditorial on Kent State shows<br />\njust how warped New Left<br />\nmindlessness has become.<br />\nIt's long been the fashion of<br />\nrads everywhere to tell it the<br />\nway they'd like to hear it<br />\ninstead of the way it was, and<br />\nyou superbly carry on that<br />\nfine tradition.<br />\nFor the record, though,<br />\nhere's what really happened:<br />\nin response to the invasion of<br />\nCambodia by some 40,000<br />\nNorth Vietnamese (no protest<br />\nhere, Baby, it's not our skins)<br />\nlast spring, Nixon orders U.S.<br />\ntroops into Cambodia.<br />\n( Oops, guys, we may have<br />\nto fight this one, so get out the<br />\nidealism and sanctity-ofhuman-life bit and we'll raise<br /><br />\nhell because, after all, we as<br />\nradical college students are<br />\nthe sole recipients of<br />\nRevealed Truth).<br />\nOutraged youthful idealists<br />\nwho are suddenly not so<br />\nidealistic when it comes to<br />\ncommitting themselves to<br />\nhalting Communist<br />\naggression against the<br />\nVietnamese people suddenly<br />\njettison their noble idea of<br />\nsolidarity with repressed<br />\npeoples and begin demonstrating their firm belief in<br />\npeace and nonviolence by<br />\narson, blocking traffic,<br />\ndisruption of classes, rockthrowing, and fire-bombing.<br />\n(All this, of course, is<br />\njustified by the tact that as<br />\nKeepers of Revealed Truth,<br />\nanything student rads believe<br /><br />\nto be true is just, heh-heh,<br />\nnaturally true.)<br />\nBut this time the National<br />\nGuard, faced with an uncontrollable mob of animals<br />\nthreatening their lives,<br />\ndecide enough is enough and<br />\nopen fire (My God, they're<br />\nreally doing it!) and the<br />\ncampuses erupt with cries of<br />\noutraged agony, the bleating<br />\nof kiddies who have dared<br />\nmama to swat their behinds<br />\nand then been so righteously<br />\nindignant when it actually<br />\nhappened.<br />\nThe<br />\nenvironment<br />\nis<br />\npolluted all right, but the<br />\nstench comes from the rank<br />\nhypocrisy which permeates<br />\nthe New Left and its ilk.<br />\nDick Oles<br />\nFencing Coach<br /><br />\nfeiffer<br />\nVOU tuAQTCP 10 6E-r<br />\nNIAFFIE12 12112/0T.<br /><br />\nCOE GOT MAQRIEP.<br /><br />\ntwto YOU Tal, HE I'M YOUQ'<br />\nOFPPECSOR MP you (A)AOT<br />\n-ro<br /><br />\nVOL) WAKTEP KIPS.<br /><br />\nYOURC L(BERATED.<br /><br />\nWF HAD KIPS.<br /><br />\nCAN) T GO t\\01,0<br /><br />\ntrISERATCP.<br /><br />\nDist.

The<br />\nchoice of design was obviously central, for the new<br />\nwould have to associate with<br />\nthe older buildings and it<br />\nwould presumably dictate the<br />\nform of other new buildings to<br />\nfollow.<br />\nThe columnar appearance<br />\nof the elevations of Garland<br />\nHall, the choice of brick and<br />\nits bond, the color contrast<br />\nbetween the brick and the<br />\nstone of the cornice and the<br />\nmolding which divides the<br />\nupper and lower tiers of<br />\nwindows, the rectangularity<br />\nof the mass and the podium<br />\non which it stands derive<br />\nfrom but do not copy the neoGeorgian architecture of the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nBut the limited number of<br />\nthe shapes employed, their<br />\ntheir<br />\nand<br />\nproportions<br />\ncharacter. . .each is heavy,<br />\nbulky, angular. . .identify the<br />\nbuilding as a member of the<br />\nstyle family of the 1960's.<br />\nLike other members of that<br />\nfamily it is arbitrary, based<br />\non design preferences and the<br />\ndiscretion of the architect<br />\nrather than on even a titular<br />\nstatement of function in<br />\ndesign.<br />\nOne can well ask why the<br />\nrising fins on the elevations<br />\nare angular rather than<br />\ncircular in section like the<br />\nduct-work they contain. The<br />\nmetal, sloping roof, about<br /><br />\nwhich I have heard adverse<br />\ncomment, is in fact a<br />\nprotection and visual disguise<br />\nfor mechancial equipment.<br />\nMost buildings today wear<br />\nsuch millinery: the dark top<br />\nstories of 1 Charles Center<br />\nand the Blaustein Building<br />\ndowntown house a mass of<br />\nairconditioning apparatus. In<br />\na building the size of Garland<br />\nHall it is merely more obvious.<br />\nThe decision to rake the<br />\nsides of the box was,<br />\nhowever, another one of those<br />\narbitrary design decisions. I<br />\nwould also query the use of a<br />\nmetal rather than a cast stone<br />\ncovering. Had the podium,<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\ncornice<br />\nthe<br />\nmechanical receptacle all<br />\nbeen of one material they<br />\nwould surely have composed<br />\na pleasing unity.<br />\nWith the building still<br />\nunfinished it is difficult to see<br />\njust how the duct work at<br />\nceiling level in the interior<br />\nwill be screened from view<br />\nthrough the windows where it<br />\nis now visible.<br />\nMr. John McElwee, Plant<br />\nPlanning, has kindly let me<br />\nlook at the plans and explained that the ceilings of the<br />\ninterior will be dropped some<br />\ninches behind the glass to<br />\ncreate a screen and form an<br />\nembrasure for draperies.<br />\nHe also explained that the<br />\nexterior panels now covered<br />\nwith a protective material<br />\nwill be dark in color.<br />\nThis will, it is obvious, pull<br />\nthe windows of the first and<br />\nsecond stories into tall units<br />\nwhich will parallel the<br />\ncolumnar theme of the<br />\ncomposition of the sides.<br />\nIt seems to me that the<br />\nsiting of the building is more<br />\nimportant than the particulars of its design. Had<br />\nGarland Hall been built, for<br />\nexample, with its back in the<br />\ntrees where the Wyman<br />\nHouse once stood and the<br />\nparking lot now is, it would<br />\nhave acquired poise, for its<br />\nlines and color would have<br />\nrelated well to the grove.<br />\nIn these impecunious days<br />\nexpensive buildings seem<br />\nirresponsible but it is still<br />\npossible to acquire a sensitive<br />\nBOOK FAIR<br /><br />\n\"A squid eating dough in a<br /><br />\npolyethylene bag is fast 'n bulbous.<br />\ngot me?\"<br /><br />\n32nd and St. Paul<br />\nPaperback Books<br />\nHallmark Cards<br />\nGifts &amp; Candles<br />\nOpen Mon-Sat. 9:30-9:00<br /><br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\n11111111111111111111111111111111111<br /><br />\nTONIGHT!<br />\nJohns Hopkins Union Memorial Nursing School<br />\n\"RAP\"<br />\nRefreshments<br />\nMusic<br />\n7:30 to 9:00<br />\nNewman House<br /><br />\n2941 N.

Opus 31, no.2; the<br />\nSonata in E flat major, Opus<br />\n31, no. 3; two Bagatelles in B<br />\nflat major and C major; the<br />\nAllegretto in b minor; and<br />\nfinally, the Sonata in c minor,<br />\nOpus 111.<br />\nAfter all the advance<br />\nHall<br />\npublicity, Shriver<br />\npatrons were probably expecting a pianist with a<br />\nsuperb technique, tremendous control, and great<br />\nsensitivity. After all, the<br />\nthirty year old Bishop did<br />\nstudy with the late Dame<br /><br />\nMyra Hess.<br />\nInstead, what transpired<br />\nbetween Mr. Bishop and the<br />\nkeyboard was mediocre at<br />\nbest, and thoroughly unmusical at worst.<br />\nWhile Bishop's technique<br />\nseems to be adequate, he<br />\nlacks a great deal of control<br />\nover the tone he produces. His<br />\ntouch was extremely percussive. even in places<br />\nrequiring pianissimo playing.<br />\nBishop just seemed unwilling<br />\nand maybe unable to play<br />\ntruly softly, and there was not<br />\neven a hint of whether he<br />\ncould play \"cantibile\".,<br />\nsomething which is a must for<br />\nBeethoven.<br />\nTo make matters worse,<br />\nMr. Bishop attempted several<br />\npieces of music that seemed<br />\nslightly out of his grasp. A<br />\ngood example is the first<br />\nwork on the program, the<br />\nSonata in d minor, Opus 31,<br /><br />\n_----SLOW:047(88<br /><br />\n/)<br /><br />\nee<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n4<br />\n0,<br /><br />\nTest-orive ii<br />\njust tar tun<br />\nGo Anywhere/Any Time<br />\nwith 4-Wheel Drive<br /><br />\nJoe<br /><br />\nII1<br />\n4 WHEEL DRIVEP<br /><br />\nThe<br />\n2car<br />\ncar<br /><br />\nHERRING JEEP<br /><br />\n310 W. 27<br />\n889-1719<br /><br />\n14.<br /><br />\nduitipcAp<br />\n.<br />\n.7<br /><br />\n*<br />\n...-<br /><br />\nUniversal<br /><br />\nno. 2.<br />\n\"Tempest\"<br />\nBishop's<br />\nSonata was full of harshness<br />\nand unwarranted rhythmic<br />\nvariations.
