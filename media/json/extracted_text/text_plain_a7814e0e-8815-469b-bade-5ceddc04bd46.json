The<br />\nquestion he said Barnes and Noble should ask itself is not \"how<br />\ncan we be even better,\" but<br />\n\"how can we be merely adequate?\"<br />\nHenry argued for more<br />\nreasonable meeting arrangements<br />\nof the Bookstore Committee. He<br />\ncalled for the committee to meet<br />\n<br />\nmore that three times a semester<br />\nor to meet for a longer time than<br />\none hour.

Dejected, you<br />\ncopy one page and take notes on<br />\nthe others.<br />\nThis scene can now be avoided. The library, in an effort to<br />\nmake life easier for students, has<br />\nintroduced a new card called<br />\nMcKey that works just like a<br />\ndebit card.<br />\nThe process is easy. After buying the card, a student needs only to insert it into any copier and<br />\npress the copy button. Once done<br />\ncopying, he can press the red button on the machine and retrieve<br />\nhis card. The machine will<br />\ndisplay how much money is left<br />\non the card.<br />\nWhen the account is low, a student can take the card back to the<br />\ndispensing machine, insert it, and<br />\ndeposit more money into the<br />\nmachine. The money will<br />\n<br />\nautomatically be credited to his<br />\naccount.<br />\nThe person responsible for the<br />\ncard system, Charles Baughan,<br />\nsaid the library decided to instal!<br />\nthe system after numerous difficulties with the old change<br />\nmachines. \"One coin can jam the<br />\nmachines and foul the whole<br />\nsystem up,\" he said.<br />\nConsequently, the library<br />\ndecided to use this system, which<br />\nwas already being used at other<br />\nuniversities. Baughan went on to<br />\nsay that the cards can be used<br />\nwith the copying machines at the<br />\nHutzler Undergraduate Library<br />\nand in Shaffer Hall.<br />\nAsked if the new cards have<br />\nany drawbacks, Baughan warned,<br />\n\"We have no way to identify<br />\nwhose card it is, it's just like<br />\nmoney.\"<br />\nThe card dispensing machines<br />\nare located on M-level, next to<br />\nthe checkout desk.

His sickness has<br />\nbeen a big shock, and it hurts the<br />\nmany<br />\non<br />\ndepartment<br />\ndimensions.\"<br />\nHamilton said, \"It is important<br />\nfor us to think about life after<br />\nthese four people. It is of crucial<br />\nimportance that we be rather aggressive in looking to replace<br />\n[retiring senior faculty members].<br />\nThis will, unfortunately, be at a<br />\ntime when there will be general<br />\nfaculty reductions within the<br />\nUniversity [as a result of the Arts<br />\nand Sciences deficit].\"<br />\nThe department anticipated its<br />\ndemographic transition several<br />\nyears ago by hiring Stephen<br />\nBlough in 1987, and David Bizer<br />\nand Enrica Detragiache this year.<br />\nIn recruiting these professors,<br />\nparticular attention was given to<br />\nthe fact that their areas of concentration coincided with those of<br />\ndeparting senior faculty. In addition, the department has authority to hire a replacement for<br />\nRobert Triest, who left last year<br />\nto teach at the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Davis.<br />\n\"There is not any unique one<br />\nto one correspondence [between<br />\nnew faculty members and old],\"<br />\nsaid Bizer, who specializes in<br />\nmacroeconomic theory and public<br />\nfinance. \"I'm thought of, for example, as partially filling Dr.<br />\nChrist's slot and the slot of Bob<br />\nTriest, a public finance<br />\neconomist.\"<br />\nWhile the departure of some of<br />\nthe department's world-class<br />\nfaculty members constitute a<br />\nblow, Christ believes that<br />\nBlough, Bizer, and Detragiache<br />\n\"are going to contribute a great<br />\ndeal in both research and<br />\nteaching.<br />\n\"These are very fine people,\"<br />\nsaid Christ. 'All are very bright<br />\nand aware of contemporary<br />\neconomics. They are certainly<br />\n[proficient] in the areas we<br />\nneed.\"<br />\nIn the past, the department<br />\nrelied heavily on visiting professors to teach international<br />\neconomics courses. With the ap-<br />\n<br />\npointment of Detragiache, the<br />\ndepartment secured a permanent<br />\ninternational economics and<br />\neconomic development professor.<br />\nThe department has fourteen<br />\nfull-time economics professors.<br />\nCompared to staff sizes of other<br />\nschools of similar caliber, which<br />\naverage around thirty to thirtyfive members, the Hopkins<br />\ndepartment is small.

The director will<br />\nhave to combine her particular<br />\nacademic expertise with administrative abilities, coordinating input from University officials, fellow faculty members,<br />\nand graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe program to be developed<br />\nis purposely being left vague. Ac-<br />\n<br />\ncording to Ferguson, the committee wants the person selected to<br />\nbe able to shape a program, determining its emphasis and structure. 'The director will have the<br />\nkey role in the evaluation of the<br />\nprogram,\" she said.<br />\nEmily Martin, chairwoman of<br />\nthe Department of Anthropology<br />\nand co-chair of last year's search<br />\ncommittee, said this freedom to<br />\n\"build from the ground up\" is<br />\npart of the appeal of the position.<br />\nThe director will have to<br />\nspecifically assess what kinds of<br />\nthings can best be done at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nFerguson hopes the appointment will be made early enough<br />\nfor the new director to meet with<br />\nstudents in the late spring, aiding<br />\nthe effort to determine existing interests and commitments.<br />\nAppeal to prospective appointees is an important issue,<br />\nbecause in the past Hopkins has<br />\nexperienced difficulty in attracting the specific type of scholar<br />\nbeing sought for the position. The<br />\nlack of tenured women faculty at<br />\nHopkins cannot be ignored; it has<br />\nbeen a neglected area for the past<br />\nfifteen years.<br />\nWith little attention being paid<br />\nto hiring a sufficient number of<br />\nwomen faculty, even less was<br />\ngiven to establishing a core group<br />\nof faculty with a concentration in<br />\ngender. Departments with<br />\nfeminist scholars are the exception rather than the rule.<br />\nAccording to Martin, \"There<br />\nare many, attractive groups of<br />\nfaculty at other universities. This<br />\nmakes it very difficult to get someone to come here.\" On the<br />\nother hand, Hopkins's size, flexibility, and growth potential in<br />\nthis area can appeal to applicants.<br />\nThe incoming director must<br />\n<br />\nbelieve the University will continue to support a women's<br />\nstudies program. The Ford grand<br />\nhas made the appointment possible, and the administration has<br />\ncome through in several ways as<br />\nwell. Two new English professors have strong interests in<br />\nwomen's studies, and the<br />\nHumanities Center is in the process of hiring an expert in<br />\nfeminist thought.<br />\nIn addition, the administration<br />\nis matching the funding of the<br />\nFord grant. In light of the current<br />\nfinancial situation, however, it<br />\nmust plan carefully to develop the<br />\nprogram. \"It is truly amazing<br />\nhow long it has taken,\" said Martin. \"Entrenched conservative<br />\nhabits of thought and slowness to<br />\nacknowledge the importance of<br />\ngendered subjects are two of the<br />\nfactors that have held us back.<br />\nWe are far behind Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, Harvard, and other<br />\nschools. There is no place that we<br />\nconsider one of our peers that is<br />\nas far behind as we are.\"<br />\nDespite Hopkins's past in the<br />\narea, Martin expressed some optimism. \"Things will change here<br />\ngradually. The tidal wave of interest cannot be held back.\"<br />\nLst year, the Women's Center<br />\ncirculated a petition asserting a<br />\nneed for more gender-related and<br />\nwomen's issues courses and requesting that the administration<br />\npay immediate attention to this<br />\narea of students' needs. With 449<br />\nsignatures, it submitted the petition to Lloyd Armstrong, dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences, last spring.<br />\nDuring the spring semester of<br />\n1987, several gender courses<br />\nwere offered. Senior Academic<br />\nAdvisor Catherine Evans and<br />\nHistory graduate student Kathleen<br />\nCanning conducted a survey of<br />\n<br />\nthe students in these classes.<br />\nEvans, who periodically<br />\nteaches a women writers course,<br />\nfound that \"students were very<br />\nenthusiastic about courses that<br />\nwere explicitly about gender<br />\ntopics. Most indicated a desire to<br />\ntake future courses and expressed their feelings that more classes<br />\nwere needed.\" Responses to the<br />\nsurvey included: \"these courses<br />\nhave had the most impact on me<br />\nin the way of my personal education here at Hopkins\"; and \"This<br />\nis probably the best course I've<br />\ntaken here at Hopkins in terms of<br />\npersonal development/growth.\"<br />\nResponses like these occurred<br />\noften in the survey.<br />\nA potential advantage to the<br />\ncreation of a director's position in<br />\nWomen's Studies is continuity<br />\nand consistency in offering<br />\nwomen's studies and genderrelated courses. Many of these<br />\ntypes of courses have been taught<br />\nhere, and a few are taught<br />\nregularly, but Hopkins offers no<br />\nguarantee that a reasonable selection of them will be taught a given<br />\nsemester.<br />\nThe course offerings for next<br />\nsemester are a good illustration of<br />\nthis problem. Only two specific<br />\ngender-related courses will be offered next semester, and one is a<br />\ngraduate seminar. Other courses<br />\nthat fit into the subject area are<br />\nbeing taught, but the University<br />\noffers no commitment to their being taught again.<br />\nAs noted by Ferguson, the<br />\nwomen's studies director will<br />\nsustain feeling for the ongoing<br />\ncourse area and will push for the<br />\ncourses, insuring constancy in the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the issue of<br />\nwomen's studies becomes a part<br />\nof the vast Human Climate con-<br />\n<br />\ncerns that have recently received<br />\nmuch attention. It is not,<br />\nhowever, only a recent issue. It<br />\nis addressed in the report of the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force, submitted in the fall of 1987, but the<br />\nsame or similar issues were addressed two years earlier in great<br />\ndepth by the Ad Hoc Committee<br />\non the Status of Women.<br />\nThat committee's report, submitted in June, 1985, outlined<br />\nstartling definitive informatiot<br />\nabout women at Hopkins in many<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter file<br />\n<br />\nSenior academic advisor<br />\nCatherine Evans<br />\n<br />\nareas, including faculty hiring<br />\nand curriculum development.

At the outset I wish to<br />\nmake it very clear that the GRO<br />\ndoes not have any position on the<br />\nissues. While it is true that the<br />\nGRO discussed the issues, as they<br />\nusually discuss all campus controversies, they never voted on<br />\nany official position. Therefore,<br />\nany remarks made by the<br />\nmembers of the GRO are those of<br />\nthe respective members only.<br />\nAs was described to me, the<br />\nChaplain is entrusted with two<br />\nroles. The first is to oversee the<br />\nreligious activities on campus.<br />\nThe second is to ensure that<br />\ngroups which \"do not have a<br />\nhome in the GRO or SAC\"<br />\n([which have been perceived to be<br />\nthe] leftists) are given the opportunity to be heard on campus.<br />\nIf it is true that the Chaplain's<br />\noffice is providing a home for the<br />\n\"homeless\" politicos, then the<br />\noffice is providing a very important and necessary service to the<br />\ncampus community. Underlying<br />\nthe creation of such a mandate,<br />\nhowever, is the assumption that<br />\nthe GRO and SAC are<br />\nsystematically discriminating<br />\nagainst groups on the basis of<br />\ntheir political views. This is in<br />\nfact a very dangerous and serious<br />\naccusation. There is absolutely no<br />\nevidence that this discrimination<br />\nis taking place. In fact, almost<br />\nhalf of the GRO recognized and<br />\nsupported groups are promoting<br />\na leftist political agenda.<br />\nThe result of all of this is that<br />\nleftist groups have two sources of<br />\nfunds: the Chaplain and either the<br />\nGRO or SAC, whereas conservative groups have only one. It is<br />\nin fact systemic discrimination<br />\nagainst conservatives that is taking place.<br />\nWhen I did raise these concerns<br />\n, to the GRO I was confronted with<br />\na barrage of accusations from<br />\nMr. Kaveh Ehsani of the<br />\nGraduates for Social Responsibility, and his \"socially responsible\" cohorts that I was trying<br />\nto stifle \"progressive\" and liberal<br />\nactivities on campus. In their<br />\nreasoning the adherence to<br />\ndemocratic form in the allocation<br />\nof funds endangers their right to<br />\nfree speech, the institution of an<br />\nevents-czar does not endanger.<br />\nOurs.<br />\n<br />\nOussama Himani<br />\n<br />\nChaplain II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was very disappointed by<br />\nMartin Stemmler's article and the<br />\neditorial last week on the role of<br />\nUniversity Chaplain Gretchen<br />\nVan Utt.<br />\nFirst: as a member of the GRO,<br />\nI can say that Stemmler's wording on the results of our meeting<br />\nwere<br />\ndiscussions<br />\nand<br />\nMISLEADING and this apparently led to the misinforming<br />\nof News-Letter editors Kathleen<br />\nMcCarthy and Flory Ware. Consistently only one member of the<br />\nGRO has raised and sustained the<br />\n<br />\nissue of the Chaplain's bias.<br />\nOther members of the board<br />\nagreed that politics and religion<br />\nhave never been separable, and<br />\nthat the Chaplain's role as one<br />\nwho raises often uncomfortable<br />\nissues on a conservative campus<br />\nis appropriate.<br />\nSecondly, making a stink about<br />\nher underfunding the Talmudic<br />\nStudy Group is opportunistic.<br />\nThat group also presented its proposal to the GRO on September<br />\n13, and its details are important.<br />\nFirst of all, the group asked for<br />\nsome $1190.00 to purchase the<br />\nfull 30 volume Talmud ($550 plus<br />\ntax), $160 plus tax for eight individual copies of the Brachot<br />\nTalmud, and $480 for speakers<br />\nand postering. This was for a<br />\ngroup they estimated at eight people, and that they were not sure<br />\nwould continue after this<br />\nsemester. The idea of giving over<br />\none hundred dollars per person to<br />\na small study group was daunting<br />\nto the GRO, and I suspect impossible for the Chaplain's office<br />\nbudget. A further point that has<br />\nnot been mentioned by anyone is<br />\nthat a 41-volume Talmud in<br />\nHebrew and at least 20 volumes<br />\nin English are available in the<br />\nMSE library for circulation.<br />\nFinally, it is my belief that the<br />\nhubbub about the Sunday Experience poster which parodied<br />\nDan Quayle before the election is<br />\na case of \"politics are OK as long<br />\nas they are about something far<br />\nfrom home.\"<br />\nThe issue of the Chaplain's role<br />\nwas NOT raised by the religious<br />\ncommunity itself, but rather by<br />\nthe College Republicans. This<br />\nshould awaken us to the fact that<br />\ntheir renewed harassment of<br />\nGretchen Van Utt is politically<br />\nmotivated, and does in fact<br />\namount to a modern day witchhunt by them to stifle liberal<br />\nvoices at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nthis responsibility has obviously<br />\nnot yet been met.<br />\nDebra Hamel<br />\n<br />\nChaplain IV<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the College Republicans prefer to attack<br />\nthe Chaplain's office rather than<br />\nengage in a meaningful discussion<br />\nof its efforts. What bothers me<br />\nabout the latest wave of misinformation is how easily it is accepted<br />\nby the Hopkins community. For<br />\nover a year, I've heard about the<br />\nso-called political leanings of OXFAM. Yet for some reason when<br />\nthe head of OXFAM USA spoke at<br />\nHopkins, not one of the parties<br />\nthat object to Oxfam's policies<br />\nshowed up. I had heard about the<br />\nspeech through the normal<br />\nsources, having spotted posters<br />\nall over the walls around campus.<br />\nI had hoped that the community<br />\nwould finally have an opportunity to address some of the real<br />\nissues and so-called controversies<br />\nthat involve Oxfam. Unfortunately, Greg Francis and Tom Corlett of the College Republicans<br />\nseem to prefer public slander as<br />\na way of making the campus<br />\nmore aware. Fellas, if you<br />\nwanted to address the issues,<br />\nGretchen Van Utt brough the<br />\nhead honcho of the whole damn<br />\norganization to Gilman Hall.<br />\nWhere were you? And why, if<br />\nthis issue concerns you so much,<br />\ndidn't our esteemed News-Letter<br />\neditors send a reporter to objectively cover the issues involved.<br />\nInstead the editors do us a disservice by perpetuating a series of<br />\nmyths about \"controversial<br />\nPolitical links.\" I've come to my<br />\nown conclusions about the<br />\nrelative worth of Oxfam, but my<br />\nideas were developed by confronting the issues directly, not<br />\nassuming that whatever<br />\nthrough<br />\nTimmons Roberts<br />\nDepartment of Sociology the College Republicans happen<br />\nto espouse is the truth.<br />\n<br />\nChaplain III<br />\nJustin Schein<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI wanted to compliment the<br />\nauthors of the News-Letter<br />\neditorial of last week for properly rebuking Chaplain Gretchen<br />\nVan Utt for her leftist priorities.<br />\nThe responsibility of a chaplain<br />\nis to the spiritual health of the<br />\nUniversity community. It is<br />\nneither her responsibility nor is it<br />\nproper for her to address political<br />\nissues at the expense of inherently spiritual matters. This is<br />\nespecially true as the office has a<br />\nlimited budget, and money offered, for example, to a political<br />\nguest lecturer such as Abbie<br />\nHoffman would be better spent on<br />\nreligious concerns.<br />\nIt is not valid to argue in this<br />\ninstance that political lectures are<br />\nimportant and.educational and are<br />\nthus a benefit to the school community. This is obviously true,<br />\nbut is also sophistry. Hopkins<br />\nsponsors lectures at which Abbie<br />\nHoffman would be a perfectly appropriate speaker, but these lectures should not be funded by the<br />\nChaplain's office, the primary<br />\nresponsibility of which is to care<br />\nfor the spiritual needs of the community. Given that the chaplain<br />\nfailed because of lack of funds to<br />\nsponsor Talmudic reading series,<br />\n<br />\nChaplain V<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhat is the source of the \"long<br />\ncontroversy\" surrounding the<br />\nChaplain's Office? It has two<br />\nsources: Gregory Francis, president of the College Republicans,<br />\nand Oussama Himani, a graduate student active in the<br />\nGraduate Representative Organization. Himani is not the GRO,<br />\nnor is he \"members of ' the<br />\nGRO. But through the good offices of the News-Letter these two<br />\nnow have the appearance of a<br />\nmass movement.<br />\nOne charge is cause for concern. Himani accuses the<br />\nChaplain of \"ignoring her own<br />\npromise\" concerning OXFAM<br />\nand the anti-hunger fast.

Crude as it is, this conceit could have acted as an effective metaphor for authordeveloping in<br />\nitarianism<br />\nAmerican culture. The aliens are<br />\ngreedy, cruel, and efficient<br />\ncapitalists, distracting the working classes with entertainments<br />\nand fashions, exploiting them for<br />\ntheir own financial gain\u2014\"just<br />\ndoing business.\" And the humans<br />\nare content with their hopeless<br />\ndelusions, asleep in the American<br />\nDream, and completely blind to<br />\nthe entire conspiracy. \"Blind\"<br />\nbecause everything appears to be<br />\nexactly as it has always been,<br />\n<br />\nunless you wear these cool dark<br />\nglasses developed by the<br />\nUnderground. When you wear<br />\nthe glasses, the false faces and<br />\nadvertisements fall away, all appearances and dreams disappear,<br />\nand everything is in black and<br />\nwhite. Behind the features of the<br />\naffluent and fashionable are bugeyed death's-head alien faces.<br />\nBeneath the billboards and advertisements are bold commands to<br />\nSLEEP, CONFORM, OBEY,<br />\nand CONSUME. DO NOT<br />\nQUESTION AUTHORITY. NO<br />\nIMAGINATION. WATCH<br />\nTELEVISION. These are, of<br />\ncourse, the commands most<br />\nentertainments and advertisements communicate to us<br />\nevery day. And dollar bills bear<br />\nthe dictate THIS IS YOUR GOD,<br />\nnot all that different from \"In<br />\nGod We Trust.\" For the first few<br />\nminutes of the film I honestly<br />\nhoped that They Live would be a<br />\n<br />\nEighties, exposing the complacency, avarice, consumerism,<br />\nescapism, and blind deference to<br />\nauthority which have characterized this decade. Yes, it is explicitly, blatantly done. Yes, the acting<br />\nis bad. And yes, the alien faces<br />\nare cheap Halloween masks. But,<br />\nall that could have been excused<br />\nif the film's ideas had been at all<br />\ndeveloped.<br />\nIt's as if some gifted, uncredited screenwriter developed<br />\nthe treatment for the film, but was<br />\nbeaten to death by John Carpenter<br />\nand a brutal gang of Hollywood<br />\nhacks who escaped with his idea<br />\nand decided that they could<br />\nrewrite it into a \"commercial<br />\nfilm\" by making the hero \"more<br />\ndecisive, more aggressive,\" cutting out all that boring stuff about<br />\nauthority and freedom, and having some big cool fights and gun<br />\nbattles.<br />\n<br />\nsa)<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nGRAMT1 FROM THE AONSCIOUS,<br />\nHEALTHY NONSMOKERS!!<br />\nNEED EXTRA CASH?

Once inside the computer,<br />\na virus can destroy data immediately, or sit like a time bomb<br />\nwaiting to explode. Like a<br />\nbiological virus, an electronic<br />\nvirus can replicate itself so that it<br />\ncan be passed to another victim.<br />\nIt is believed that the first computer viruses were created by<br />\nmalicious programmers bent on<br />\npunishing users who illegally copied programs, thereby decreasing the potential sales of merchants. The most elegant of these<br />\nvigilante programs, as reported<br />\nby Time magazine, is the Brain<br />\nvirus. This virus was created by<br />\ntwo Pakistani brothers in their<br />\nLahore software warehouse called Brain Computer Services. At<br />\nthis store, brand name computer<br />\nprograms like Lotus 1-2-3 and<br />\n<br />\nWordstar, which cost several<br />\nhundred dollars in the United<br />\nStates, can be bought for $1.50.<br />\nThe catch is that Americans, who<br />\nthe brothers suspected would illegally copy the disks, were given<br />\ndisks contaminated with the<br />\nvirus. Any time the disks were<br />\ncopied or used on machines<br />\nshared by many programmers,<br />\nthe virus would copy itself and<br />\ndestroy data on that machine.<br />\n.Astute programmers were able to<br />\nfind a message amongst their<br />\ndestroyed data that read:<br />\nTHE<br />\n\"WELCOME<br />\nTO<br />\nDUNGEON.. .CONTACT US<br />\nFOR VACCINATION\" along<br />\nwith the name and phone number<br />\nof the Pakistani store. It is<br />\nestimated that over 100,000 IBM<br />\nPC floppy disks were contaminated with this malicious,<br />\nvirus, including 10,000 disks<br />\nat George Washington University<br />\nalone.<br />\nThe Pakistani virus is one strain<br />\nof many that are currently being<br />\npassed from one floppy disk to<br />\nanother across the U.S. Not all<br />\nviruses, however, are intended to<br />\npunish programmmers. Last<br />\nDecember a Christmas greeting<br />\nmysteriously appeared on the terminals of a worldwide network<br />\noperated by IBM. When programmers obeyed the instruction<br />\nto type the word \"Christmas\"<br />\nthey unknowingly triggered a<br />\nself-replicating process that sent<br />\na copy of the program to every<br />\nname on their mailing list.<br />\n<br />\nA year of meeting<br />\nindustrialists and<br />\npoliticians, social<br />\nworkers and teachers,<br />\nfarmers and<br />\nagriculturalists.<br />\n<br />\n!Another playful program made its<br />\n,way through the computers at<br />\nseveral Ivy League schools<br />\nflashing the message \"I want a.<br />\ncookie.\" The message flashed<br />\nfaster and faster until the user,<br />\nkeyed in the letters \"C-0-0-K-IE.\"<br />\nAll of these viruses, whether<br />\nthey are malicious or playful,<br />\ndemonstrate the vulnerability of<br />\nthe world's computer networks.<br />\nThe virus that attacked Arpanet.<br />\nwas intended to move through the<br />\ntelephone lines that connect the<br />\ncomputers and simply hide in the<br />\n'recesses of each computer's<br />\nmemory. The program contained<br />\nan error, however, and it ended<br />\nup overloading the memories of<br />\nthe computers, facing a shutdown. The virus, created by<br />\nRobert T. Morris Jr., turned out<br />\nto be more of a nuisance than<br />\nanything else.

Vaccines have<br />\nbeen successful against smallpox,<br />\npolio, measles, and other viral<br />\ndiseases. However, the development of a vaccine against the<br />\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus<br />\n(HIV), which causes AIDS, has<br />\nbeen surprisingly difficult.<br />\nVaccines rally the body's immune response against the<br />\ndisease-causing organism, the<br />\npathogen. When a pathogen invades the body, the immune<br />\nsystem directs cells and antibodies against an antigen. which<br />\nis an exposed part of the<br />\npathogen's surface. Certain cells<br />\nof the immune system, known as<br />\nT4 helper cells, generated during this encounter, \"remember\"<br />\nthe antigen and prevent another<br />\ninfection by invoking a swifter<br />\nand a more potent immune<br />\nresponse the next time the<br />\npathogen invades. The immune<br />\nresponse produces antibodies<br />\nagainst a specific antigen and<br />\ndoes not attack other antigens.<br />\nVaccines introduce harmless<br />\nversions of pathogens to the immune system. The immune system<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nreacts to the harmless versions as<br />\nthough they were the real<br />\npathogen, and activates its T4<br />\nhelper cells. In AIDS, however,<br />\nHIV's primary target are T4<br />\ncells. T4 cells infected with HIV<br />\ncannot activate an immune<br />\nresponse against the virus. An<br />\nAIDS vaccine must prevent the<br />\nvirus from infecting T4 cells.<br />\nThe AIDS vaccine would also<br />\nhave to halt the virus before it invades the central nervous system,<br />\nwhere pathogens are invulnerable<br />\nto immune attack, because cells<br />\nof the immune system cannot<br />\neasily diffuse across the bloodbrain barrier. The AIDS vaccine<br />\nwould also have to recognize all<br />\nHIV variants. Most importantly,<br />\nthe vaccine must carry no risk of<br />\nitself causing AIDS.<br />\nHIV is a retrovirus and, like<br />\nother viruses, it inserts its genes<br />\ninto the infected cell's genes.<br />\nUnlike other viruses, however,<br />\nretroviral genes can be dormant<br />\nfor long periods of time; the infected cell may remain invisible<br />\nto the immune system because the<br />\ngenes are not expressed as proteins that form the surface antigens. Hence, total eradication of<br />\na retroviral infection is virtually<br />\nimpossible<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nTrerarnffen-or-Hopkins Affiliates<br />\nPAY NO RENT<br />\n<br />\n'till January 1989<br />\nROLAND RIDGE<br />\nAPARTMENTS<br />\nACT NOM...<br />\n<br />\n2 Months FREE RENT<br />\nLarge 1 and 2 Bedroom<br />\nApartments<br />\n...Limited Number Available....<br />\nCALL NOW<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCLASSIFIEDS<br />\n<br />\nYOU QUALIFY FOR<br />\nINSTANT CREDIT!.

For example, gp120 proteins, found on the surface of both<br />\nthe virus and infected cells, provide a likely antigen target for antibodies. But HIV continuaaly<br />\nvaries gp120's structure, making<br />\nantigen-specific vaccines useless.<br />\nHIV infects cells by binding to<br />\none of the gp120 cell surface proteins, called CD4. To prevent infection, vaccines must impede<br />\nHIV from binding to CD4. Vaccines can supply antibodies that<br />\nresemble CD4 and thus bind to all<br />\nthe virus's CD4 receptor sites<br />\npreventing it from infecting cells.<br />\nBut CD4-like antibodies are<br />\nforeign to the body and provoke<br />\nan \"autoimmune response\"<br />\nwhich produces antibodies<br />\nagainst the first antibody. The<br />\nanti-antibodies can attack CD4<br />\nand destroy the very cells that the<br />\nfirst antibody tries to protect.<br />\nAn AIDS vaccine must take<br />\nthese properties into account in<br />\norder to find the HIV's Achilles<br />\nheel. HIV is not invulnerable:<br />\ncomponents of the immune<br />\nsystem have a proven ability to<br />\nneutralize the virus in the test<br />\ntube. People infected with HIV<br />\ninitially launch a strong antibody<br />\nand killer cell assault on the virus.<br />\nThese defenses hold the virus in<br />\ncheck for years, but the people<br />\neventually develop AIDS. The<br />\nimmune system fights back; it just<br />\ndoes not fight hard enough.<br />\nThe trick is to discover whichi<br />\npart of the HIV elicits the most<br />\npowerful immune response and<br />\namplify that response to overcome the virus. Most researchers<br />\nbelieve that the best site is on the<br />\nviral surface protein gp120.<br />\nMuch of gp120 is hidden from<br />\nimmunological sight by a cloud of<br />\nsugar molecules. A cleft where<br />\nthe virus binds to CD4 and a loop<br />\nhat that protrudes above the sugar<br />\ncloud, are two of gp120's exposed regions. The CD4 binding<br />\ncleft is vital to the virus's function and is invariant among<br />\nviruses. But this antigenic site, as<br />\nmentioned before, causes an<br />\nautoimmune response.<br />\nOn the other hand, the loop can<br />\nbe easily recognized and does not<br />\nelicit an autoimmune response.<br />\n<br />\nBut the loop is one of the most<br />\nvariable regions of the protein.<br />\nVariability enables the loop to<br />\ndodge the response it invoked; a<br />\nsingle change in the protein structure creates a different antibody<br />\nspecificity. Researchers are<br />\nworking on a vaccine that can anticipate and destroy all mutated<br />\nforms.<br />\nEvan as research on vaccine<br />\nstrategies goes on, a number of<br />\nAIDS vaccines are being tested in<br />\nhumans. The efficacy of the<br />\nclinical trials is unknown because<br />\nof the short time since their inception. Also, unlike other human<br />\nviral diseases, HIV does not attack animals. Most animals don't<br />\nget AIDS, even when injected<br />\nwith HIV; no one knows why.<br />\nLack of a good animal model with<br />\nHIV means that the only way to<br />\ntest a vaccine's efficacy is to try<br />\nit on humans. Understandably,<br />\nthere is shortage of volunteers to<br />\ntry a vaccine with no known efficacy that carries a risk of<br />\ncausing AIDS.<br />\nTraditional vaccines that use<br />\nkilled or weakened virus are<br />\navoided because of the risks<br />\nassociated with innoculating<br />\nwhole HIV's. Most of the vaccine<br />\ntrials employ a piece of HIV, like<br />\ngp120, as antigens. To ensure<br />\nthat the immune system sees the<br />\nantigen, the protein is cornplexed with large compounds like<br />\nalum. Results gathered so far<br />\nhave been ambiguous, but doctors<br />\nbelieve that use of an antigen<br />\ncomplex with artificial membranes like liposomes, instead of<br />\nalum, may improve performance. The most impressive<br />\nresults to date have been obtained from the use of a similar complex with weakened cow pox<br />\nvirus. Innoculation is followed by<br />\nweekly boosters of gp120 precursors and uninfected T cells from<br />\nan AIDS patient, to amplify<br />\nresponse to levels high enough to<br />\nbe considered immune. Booster<br />\ndosage varies depending upon the<br />\nimmune system's response,<br />\nwhich must be measured every<br />\nweek. This test was the first use<br />\nof an AIDS vaccine in humans;<br />\nhead researcher Daniel Zagury<br />\ntook many by surprise when he<br />\n<br />\ninnoculated himself along with<br />\nthe first volunteers in November<br />\n1986. This vaccine works, but it<br />\nis too complicated to administer<br />\nto humans en masse. It does,<br />\nhowever, demonstrate that immunity to HIV could be achieved in humans.<br />\nAnother trial has a subunit vaccine based on another internal<br />\ncomponent of the virus which is<br />\nnot a gp120 protein. HGP-30 vaccine mimics a protein that lines<br />\nthe inside of HIV's surface and<br />\ninduces the body to produce antibodies against it. The protein is<br />\nexposed to immune attack when<br />\nHIV attacks a cell. HGP-30 has<br />\nhad encouraging results and<br />\nawaits approval of the FDA for<br />\nmass testing.<br />\nIn another trial in England,<br />\nresearchers innoculate an<br />\nuninfected blood sample with antibodies against the CD4 protein.<br />\nThis causes blood to develop its<br />\nown anti-antibodies that resemble<br />\nCD4. These CD4-like antobodies, which can compete with<br />\ncells in binding HIV, are isolated<br />\nand injected into uninfected people. This procedure avoids an<br />\nauto-immune response and ensures that fewer cells are infected<br />\nwith HIV, as most of the free<br />\nvirus is tied up by the antibodies.<br />\nNo preliminary results have been<br />\ntibodies, but this approach looks<br />\npromising.<br />\nMost of these AIDS vaccines<br />\nhave yet to be proven on a large<br />\nscale. Over twenty-five hundred<br />\nscientists in Africa, Europe, and<br />\nthe Americas are currently engaged in the effort to develop an<br />\nAIDS vaccine. The United States<br />\nfederal budget provides over two<br />\nbillion dollars for research on an<br />\nAIDS vaccine alone. Government, industry, and academic<br />\nresearch efforts are being coordinated, under the aegis of the<br />\nNational Cooperative Vaccine<br />\nDevelopment Groups, to pool expertise in a multitude of virus<br />\ntypes, in the mechanisms of gene<br />\nregulation, and in the workings of<br />\nthe immune system. It is hoped<br />\nthat HIV cannot outwit such a<br />\ncombination.<br />\n<br />\nEngineering honors<br />\nby Sonia Marx<br />\nTau Beta Pi is the national<br />\nengineering honor society,<br />\nestablished<br />\nin<br />\n1885 to<br />\nacknowledge high academic<br />\nachievement and exemplary<br />\ncharacter.

This question and many others are<br />\nanswered in What Can I Do With<br />\nMy Microwave?<br />\nRuth Spear, a freelance food<br />\nwriter, has compiled 270 different tips about microwaves.<br />\nThese tips include how to choose<br />\na microwave, as well as its<br />\nmaintenance. There are also sections which are divided as to<br />\ncooking method, i.e. braising or<br />\npoaching, and as to type of food<br />\ncooked. This division of topics<br />\nenables quick reference.<br />\nThe book's practical use for a<br />\nHopkins student varies widely on<br />\nthe person who might refer to it.<br />\nIt contains many basic facts about<br />\nmechanics of how<br />\nthe<br />\nmicrowaves cook and the consequences that might result from<br />\nnot being aware of the differences<br />\nin microwave cooking versus<br />\nconventional cooking. For instance, according to Spear,<br />\n<br />\nmicrowaves cook from the outside in, but tend to penetrate a.<br />\nfinite distance into the food, relying on transfer of heat within the<br />\nfood to cook the innermost portions. Because microwaves don't<br />\nhave to heat the food to cook it,<br />\nthis transfer of heat often lags<br />\nbehind the actual oven time<br />\nprescribed. As a result,<br />\nmicrowave-cooked food requires<br />\nstanding time. While this fact<br />\nmight seem obvious to the more<br />\ncosmopolitan gourmet, it is useful<br />\ninformation to the novice.<br />\nHowever, the book contains<br />\nseveral hints which indicate<br />\nusefulness for a more experienced or sophisticated cook. Included, for example, is a method<br />\nto soften unripe avocados for<br />\nguacamole, as well as pointers for<br />\nadapting favorite conventional<br />\nrecipes to those which work in the<br />\nmicrowave. Problems in adapting<br />\nmight result from not changing<br />\nthe spicing or the moisture content in the microwave recipe.<br />\nAlso, sauces that are made with<br />\nmilk or eggs tend to behave differently in the microwave than<br />\nwhen cooked conventionally.<br />\n<br />\n57FOR C00KING4A0<br />\ntv40,9e.<br />\n<br />\nIhmi<br />\ntiS\\<br />\n<br />\nCAN I DO WM MY<br />\n<br />\n270<br />\n<br />\nAMAZING TIPS ANO IDEAS\\\\<br />\nTHAT SHOW YOU HOW ID<br />\nMAKE THE MOST OF YOUR<br />\nMIRACLE APPLIANCE<br />\nDELL-`,'<br />\n<br />\n'\u2022U S $395<br />\nC.AN<br />\n<br />\nFurthermore, there are many<br />\nwho eschew cooking in the<br />\nmicrowave because the texture<br />\nand color of certain foods, like<br />\nbreads or meats, aren't quite the<br />\nsame as cooking them conventionally.

He jiggled his knee in time<br />\nwith the music someone was playing<br />\non the jukebox. When the music stopped his knee kept going. He played<br />\n,with his straw, rolling it into a spiral,<br />\nthen unrolling it and chewing its ends.<br />\nIt wheezed through a slit in its side<br />\nwhen he tried to drink through it.<br />\nThe waitress who had taken his<br />\norder brought a grillP,<br />\n..1 ,neese and<br />\nbacon sandwich io the table. Stuart<br />\nsmiled. He considered mentioning that<br />\nhe had ordered a cheeseburger, but<br />\nsaid nothing. He hated bacon. Between bites he guzzled his milk, trying<br />\nunsuccessfully to drown the taste.<br />\nThe waitress came back half a sandwich later. She had brought Stuart's<br />\ncheeseburger to a woman who promptly mentioned the mistake.<br />\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said to him. \"I<br />\nforgot you ordered a cheeseburger.\"<br />\n\"No problem. I don't mind this.\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"Are you sure I can't get you one<br />\nnow?\"<br />\n\"No, really,\" he said. \"This is fine.\"<br />\nHe ordered another milk. She hurried off to get it.<br />\nA fat woman in a flowered polyester<br />\nshirt was sitting in a nearby booth. She<br />\nstruck a match. Stuart smelled the<br />\nsulfur. She lit a cigarette and held it<br />\nbetween thick fingers. Her other hand<br />\nrested on the table next to a notice that<br />\niread, \"Thank You For Not Smoking.\"<br />\nA similar notice was on Stuart's table.<br />\nHe pushed it with his elbow to where<br />\nshe could see it. She kept smoking.<br />\nThe smoke curled and danced and<br />\nfinally found him. It hovered over his<br />\nmilk and grilled cheese. It coated his<br />\nsinuses. Breathing became difficult.<br />\n\"Excuse me,\" the fat woman called<br />\nover to him. \"Do you have an<br />\nashtray?\"<br />\n\"No,\" he said. \"I'm sorry. I don't.\"<br />\n<br />\nShe got one from another table.<br />\nStuart hurried to finish his lunch and<br />\nescape the smoke. He left the' diner,<br />\nhoping the fresh air would help his<br />\nbreathing. Instead, the sudden cold<br />\nmade it worse. He stopped on the<br />\nsidewalk, overcome by asthma. Two<br />\nbreaths from the inhaler he always carried cleared his lungs.<br />\nHe put the inhaler back in his coat<br />\npocket and walked to the bus stop. A<br />\nyoung woman was standing there. Her<br />\nLabrador retriever was sniffing the<br />\nbase of a telephone pole.<br />\n\"Do you know the time?\" she said<br />\nto him.<br />\n\"I think it's about one-thirty, but I'm<br />\nnot really sure,\" he said.<br />\nThe dog began to smell Stuart's<br />\nknee. He bent and pet the coarse, tan<br />\nhair on its back.<br />\n\"A beautiful animal. He can't be<br />\nvery old,\" he said.<br />\n\"Six months.\"<br />\n\"He's already huge. I had one<br />\nmyself once.\"<br />\nThe dog's snout moved up Stuart's<br />\nleg. Stuart pushed the nose back dowrr<br />\nto his knee.<br />\n\"My Lab just never seemed very<br />\nsmart,\" he said.<br />\nThe dog wrapped his left paw<br />\naround Stuart's leg. Stuart stepped<br />\nback. The woman said,\"No, Trooper!\"<br />\nand pulled him back by the leash.<br />\n\"He's very affectionate, though,\"<br />\nshe said.<br />\n\"So I see.\"<br />\nThe dog jumped up and wrapped<br />\nboth front paws around Stuart's knee.<br />\n\"Get down, Trooper! Get down,\"<br />\nshe said. She pulled him off Stuart's<br />\nleg, then stepped back.<br />\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said. \"I think I'd<br />\nbetter get him away from you.\"<br />\n\"It's okay. Dogs will be dogs,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nShe smiled and walked away. The<br />\ndog ran ahead of her, straining at the<br />\n<br />\nleash.<br />\nStuart tried to clean the muddy paw<br />\nprints from his pants. He rubbed them<br />\nvigorously with handfuls of snow.<br />\nWhen his hands could no longer bear<br />\nthe cold, he stopped. He stuffed them<br />\nin his pockets. His legs froze beneath<br />\nthe wet spots iri his pants. He looked<br />\nback longingly at the diner, wishing he<br />\ncould wait inside. The door opened.<br />\nThe fat woman was leaving. She<br />\nstepped gingerly down the icy stairs.<br />\nWalking toward her car, she adjusted<br />\nher bra. She slipped a hand in the neck<br />\nof her flowered polyester shirt and dug<br />\nthe wide straps from grooves in her<br />\nshoulders. Her car was parked near<br />\nwhere Stuart stood. She recognized<br />\nhim.<br />\n\"Where you headed?\" she said,<br />\nstanding by her car door.<br />\n\"I'm just taking the bus,\" he said.<br />\n\"Where to? You've got a long wait.\"<br />\n\"Down to the green. I think the bus<br />\nwill be here soon,\" he said.<br />\n\"It's every hour on Saturdays.<br />\nYou've got a half hour wait.\"<br />\nStuart frowned and looked down the<br />\nstreet.<br />\n\"If you want a ride I'm heading that<br />\nway,\" she said.<br />\nHe hesitated, thinking of his asthma<br />\nand her cigarettes. Unable to think of<br />\nan excuse, he thanked her and accepted the offer.<br />\nStuart waited in the car while the<br />\nwoman cleared snow from the windows. He sat with his arms folded,<br />\navoiding her glances by staring at the<br />\ndashboard. A tobacco-stained statue<br />\nof Jesus stared back. The woman<br />\nopened the car door. The seat jumped<br />\nwhen she sat down.<br />\n\"My name's Mary,\" she said. She.<br />\nwas smiling broadly, her teeth as<br />\nyellowed as the Jesus statue. \"So tell<br />\nme where you live near the green. I used to live there myself until I moved<br />\nthree years ago. I know the area like<br />\n<br />\nthe back Of-My hand.\"<br />\nHe glanced at her plump hand. \"It's<br />\non the corner of Park and George<br />\nStreet,\" he said. \"A two-story house.<br />\nBrown.\"<br />\n\"Oh yes, I know the one,\" she said.<br />\n\"Always lit up like a firecracker around<br />\nChristmas time.

In fact, the entire team did not forecheck well<br />\nat all.<br />\n\"Towson State played the exact type of game we should gave<br />\nplayed,\" said coach Steve Wirth.<br />\n\"These guys [Towson State]<br />\ncame out there wanting this<br />\ngame, and we just handed it to<br />\nthem. We were riding on last<br />\nnight's game,\" referring to the<br />\nJays' 5-1 victory over Western<br />\nMaryland last Wednesday.<br />\nOffensively, the Blue Jays have<br />\nbeen producing well. Marquardt<br />\ncontinued his scoring rampage<br />\nwith a hat trick and an assist as<br />\nJay Cawkins scored his first goal<br />\nof the year off Marquardt's rebound. First line center Pat Gibbons also played well, setting up<br />\ntwo of his linemate's three goals.<br />\nHopkins showed a lot of heart<br />\nin their 4-4 tie against Dickinson<br />\non Monday. The team proved that<br />\nit could play well even without<br />\nsome of its key players. Hopkins<br />\nwas missing defenseman Mike<br />\nHolmes, who was thrown out early in the first period for unsportsmanlike conduct, and Bill<br />\nMarquardt, who was also charged with the same call, but not<br />\nbefore scoring his eighth goal of<br />\nthe year. The Blue Jays picked up<br />\nthe slack well, however, with<br />\nthree other players scoring goals.<br />\nJoe Zangara scored his first goal<br />\nof the season as his slapshot off<br />\nthe face-off found an opening past<br />\nthe goalie. Pat Gibbons also<br />\nscored, as well as Pierre Dematos<br />\n(his first).<br />\nThe Blue Jays will meet Gettysburg on Thursday, December<br />\n8, as they wrap things up for this<br />\nsemester.

The Blue<br />\nJays are coming off a very successful 21-1 season last year,<br />\nwhich saw them win their fifth<br />\nconsecutive MAC Championship. The Jays were uncertain as<br />\nto whether they could continue<br />\nthat championship streak this<br />\nyear, as they field five rookies in<br />\na team of nine. But this 2-0 start<br />\ngives the team and its coach,<br />\nRichard Oles, championship<br />\ngoals for the future.<br />\nThe foil team started its season<br />\nwith a bang, as it defeated Purchase by a score of 7-2 and Drew<br />\nby a score of 8-1. The team was<br />\nled by senior co-captain David<br />\n\"Traffic\" Cohen, who was 5-0<br />\non the day. Also leading the way<br />\nwas junior Yen Len \"Party<br />\nAnimal\" Tang, who also finished with a 5-0 mark. Freshman<br />\nRich \"Boo-Boo\" Milhiser obtained his first varsity win and<br />\ndefeat as he ended the day at 1-1.<br />\nSophomores Li Kuo \"Laughing<br />\nBoy\" Kong and Peter \"Sleepy\"<br />\nLiu each had very successful varsity debuts, as they each won a<br />\nbout and ended their day at 1-0.<br />\nThe most mysterious event of<br />\nthe day was when junior Mike<br />\n\"Mad Dog\" Greenfeld was kidnapped by his evil twin prior to<br />\nthe Purchase meet. The twin<br />\nsubstituted for Mike in the Purchase meet and was very disappointing as he lost both his bouts.<br />\nMike was able to free himself<br />\nbefore the Drew meet and uncover the imposter. He redeemed himself for his twin's evildoings to even his record at 2-2.<br />\nThe epee team also started their<br />\nseason on a winning note as they<br />\ndefeated Purchase and Drew by<br />\nthe scores of 6-3 and 5-4, respectively. Defeating Purchase was<br />\nnot easy, as senior co-captain<br />\nRobert \"General\" Lee met with<br />\nthe same fate as foilist Mike<br />\nGreenfield. Lee's evil twin incapacitated him before the meet,<br />\nresulting in a disappointing 1-2<br />\nrecord. Fortunately, Bob freed<br />\nhimself and was a respectable 1-1<br />\nagainst Drew. Sophomores Andrew \"Flash\" Donnalley and Ian<br />\n\"Iron Man\" Held picked up the<br />\nslack as they posted impressive<br />\n5-0 and 4-1 marks respectively on<br />\nthe day. Rookie sophomores Ben<br />\n\"Who Me?\" Lonske, Tim \"Express\" Train, and Dan \"Golden<br />\nBoy\" Weaver allowed the butterflies of their varsity debuts to<br />\novercome them, as each finished<br />\nthe day with a 0-1 mark.<br />\nThe sabre team was also very<br />\nimpressive with a crushing 8-1<br />\nwin over Purchase and a close 5-4<br />\nwin over Drew. Junior cocaptain Andrew \"X-ray\"<br />\nJablonowski had a magnificent<br />\nday, cruising with a 2-0 record<br />\nagainst Purchase until an injury<br />\n<br />\nHappy 20th<br />\nBirthday,<br />\nColeen!!!<br />\n<br />\nstruck him down in his first bout<br />\nagainst Drew. Luckily, supersub<br />\nPeter \"Destructo\" Kim was able<br />\nto step in and win the bout for his<br />\nfallen captain. Peter ended his<br />\nday with a fine 3-1 mark. Junior<br />\nDave \"Bubba\" Howe was his<br />\nusual consistent self as he posted<br />\na 4-1 mark. Sophomore John<br />\n\"Rocky\" O'Connell was<br />\nmagnificent in his varsity debut as<br />\nhe posted a record of 4-2 for the<br />\nday. Sophomore Juan \"Valdez\"<br />\nSuros could not capitalize on the<br />\nopportunity of his varsity debut as<br />\nhe ended the day at 0-1.<br />\nThese were the only meets the<br />\nJays had before the Christmas<br />\nbreak, but they will return in<br />\nJanuary for the bulk of their<br />\nseason. Their schedule will include the U.S.F.A. National Collegiate Championships, the Division ifi National Championships,<br />\nand the U.A.A.

But the lack<br />\nof rest did not seem to affect the<br />\nswimming Jays, as their performances included many individual<br />\nvictories and a few NCAA qualifying times.<br />\nThe weekend began Wednesday, November 30, with a meet<br />\nat Franklin and Marshall College<br />\nin Pennsylvania. This was the<br />\nfirst Division III school which<br />\nHopkins has competed against<br />\nthis season and the Jays' excellence was apparent.

The<br />\nquestion he said Barnes and Noble should ask itself is not \"how<br />\ncan we be even better,\" but<br />\n\"how can we be merely adequate?\"<br />\nHenry argued for more<br />\nreasonable meeting arrangements<br />\nof the Bookstore Committee. He<br />\ncalled for the committee to meet<br /><br />\nmore that three times a semester<br />\nor to meet for a longer time than<br />\none hour.

The time is<br />\nlate and you need to copy five<br />\npages from the text you are<br />\nreading. You check your pockets<br />\nand to your horror, you find you<br />\nhave only a nickel. Dejected, you<br />\ncopy one page and take notes on<br />\nthe others.<br />\nThis scene can now be avoided. The library, in an effort to<br />\nmake life easier for students, has<br />\nintroduced a new card called<br />\nMcKey that works just like a<br />\ndebit card.<br />\nThe process is easy. After buying the card, a student needs only to insert it into any copier and<br />\npress the copy button. Once done<br />\ncopying, he can press the red button on the machine and retrieve<br />\nhis card. The machine will<br />\ndisplay how much money is left<br />\non the card.<br />\nWhen the account is low, a student can take the card back to the<br />\ndispensing machine, insert it, and<br />\ndeposit more money into the<br />\nmachine. The money will<br /><br />\nautomatically be credited to his<br />\naccount.<br />\nThe person responsible for the<br />\ncard system, Charles Baughan,<br />\nsaid the library decided to instal!<br />\nthe system after numerous difficulties with the old change<br />\nmachines. \"One coin can jam the<br />\nmachines and foul the whole<br />\nsystem up,\" he said.<br />\nConsequently, the library<br />\ndecided to use this system, which<br />\nwas already being used at other<br />\nuniversities. Baughan went on to<br />\nsay that the cards can be used<br />\nwith the copying machines at the<br />\nHutzler Undergraduate Library<br />\nand in Shaffer Hall.<br />\nAsked if the new cards have<br />\nany drawbacks, Baughan warned,<br />\n\"We have no way to identify<br />\nwhose card it is, it's just like<br />\nmoney.\"<br />\nThe card dispensing machines<br />\nare located on M-level, next to<br />\nthe checkout desk.

His sickness has<br />\nbeen a big shock, and it hurts the<br />\nmany<br />\non<br />\ndepartment<br />\ndimensions.\"<br />\nHamilton said, \"It is important<br />\nfor us to think about life after<br />\nthese four people. It is of crucial<br />\nimportance that we be rather aggressive in looking to replace<br />\n[retiring senior faculty members].<br />\nThis will, unfortunately, be at a<br />\ntime when there will be general<br />\nfaculty reductions within the<br />\nUniversity [as a result of the Arts<br />\nand Sciences deficit].\"<br />\nThe department anticipated its<br />\ndemographic transition several<br />\nyears ago by hiring Stephen<br />\nBlough in 1987, and David Bizer<br />\nand Enrica Detragiache this year.<br />\nIn recruiting these professors,<br />\nparticular attention was given to<br />\nthe fact that their areas of concentration coincided with those of<br />\ndeparting senior faculty. In addition, the department has authority to hire a replacement for<br />\nRobert Triest, who left last year<br />\nto teach at the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Davis.<br />\n\"There is not any unique one<br />\nto one correspondence [between<br />\nnew faculty members and old],\"<br />\nsaid Bizer, who specializes in<br />\nmacroeconomic theory and public<br />\nfinance. \"I'm thought of, for example, as partially filling Dr.<br />\nChrist's slot and the slot of Bob<br />\nTriest, a public finance<br />\neconomist.\"<br />\nWhile the departure of some of<br />\nthe department's world-class<br />\nfaculty members constitute a<br />\nblow, Christ believes that<br />\nBlough, Bizer, and Detragiache<br />\n\"are going to contribute a great<br />\ndeal in both research and<br />\nteaching.<br />\n\"These are very fine people,\"<br />\nsaid Christ. 'All are very bright<br />\nand aware of contemporary<br />\neconomics. They are certainly<br />\n[proficient] in the areas we<br />\nneed.\"<br />\nIn the past, the department<br />\nrelied heavily on visiting professors to teach international<br />\neconomics courses. With the ap-<br /><br />\npointment of Detragiache, the<br />\ndepartment secured a permanent<br />\ninternational economics and<br />\neconomic development professor.<br />\nThe department has fourteen<br />\nfull-time economics professors.<br />\nCompared to staff sizes of other<br />\nschools of similar caliber, which<br />\naverage around thirty to thirtyfive members, the Hopkins<br />\ndepartment is small. While that<br />\nimplies a limit to the quantity of<br />\nresources available here, many<br />\nbenefits result from a small size.<br />\n\"It forces us to stay broad intellectually,\" said Hamilton.<br />\nKhan added, \"The department<br />\nattaches a lot of importance to its<br />\nfaculty having broad interests<br />\nbecause of size and resources.<br />\n\"A distinguishing feature [of<br />\nthe economics department] in this<br />\nage of specialization is that we<br />\nstill have one general seminar<br />\nwhere all the faculty and all the<br />\ngraduate students attend,\" said<br />\nKhan.<br />\nDesigned to cover a broad<br />\nmenu of topics, the seminar is the<br />\none unifying feature of the program, according to Christ.<br />\nWalters believes the economics<br />\nprofession has become specialized and narrow, placing more em-<br /><br />\nphasis on technology and less on<br />\neconomic policy, thereby affecting the type of future economics<br />\nprofessors.<br />\n\"The system doesn't produce<br />\njacks-of-all-trades with an emphasis on policy,\" said Walters,<br />\n\"so the supply of people is rather<br />\ndifferent.\"<br />\nSpecialization, however, is not<br />\nnecessarily a negative progression. \"Just as in medicine, progress often takes the form of<br />\nspecialization,\" said Bizer.<br />\n\"Since we're a small department,<br />\nwe're cognizant of that fact. We<br />\ntry to hire people who are highlyqualified in more than one field.\"<br />\nAlthough the trend of<br />\neconomics is toward \"capital intensive\" research and teaching in<br />\nterms of large grants and size of<br />\nresearch staffs, Khan said that the<br />\neconomics department has been<br />\nable to maintain an advantage in<br />\nintuitive, classical teaching.<br />\n\"Our mission is first to highlevel undergraduate and graduate<br />\nteaching,\" said Khan. \"That mission will continue.

The director will<br />\nhave to combine her particular<br />\nacademic expertise with administrative abilities, coordinating input from University officials, fellow faculty members,<br />\nand graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe program to be developed<br />\nis purposely being left vague. Ac-<br /><br />\ncording to Ferguson, the committee wants the person selected to<br />\nbe able to shape a program, determining its emphasis and structure. 'The director will have the<br />\nkey role in the evaluation of the<br />\nprogram,\" she said.<br />\nEmily Martin, chairwoman of<br />\nthe Department of Anthropology<br />\nand co-chair of last year's search<br />\ncommittee, said this freedom to<br />\n\"build from the ground up\" is<br />\npart of the appeal of the position.<br />\nThe director will have to<br />\nspecifically assess what kinds of<br />\nthings can best be done at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nFerguson hopes the appointment will be made early enough<br />\nfor the new director to meet with<br />\nstudents in the late spring, aiding<br />\nthe effort to determine existing interests and commitments.<br />\nAppeal to prospective appointees is an important issue,<br />\nbecause in the past Hopkins has<br />\nexperienced difficulty in attracting the specific type of scholar<br />\nbeing sought for the position. The<br />\nlack of tenured women faculty at<br />\nHopkins cannot be ignored; it has<br />\nbeen a neglected area for the past<br />\nfifteen years.<br />\nWith little attention being paid<br />\nto hiring a sufficient number of<br />\nwomen faculty, even less was<br />\ngiven to establishing a core group<br />\nof faculty with a concentration in<br />\ngender. Departments with<br />\nfeminist scholars are the exception rather than the rule.<br />\nAccording to Martin, \"There<br />\nare many, attractive groups of<br />\nfaculty at other universities. This<br />\nmakes it very difficult to get someone to come here.\" On the<br />\nother hand, Hopkins's size, flexibility, and growth potential in<br />\nthis area can appeal to applicants.<br />\nThe incoming director must<br /><br />\nbelieve the University will continue to support a women's<br />\nstudies program. The Ford grand<br />\nhas made the appointment possible, and the administration has<br />\ncome through in several ways as<br />\nwell. Two new English professors have strong interests in<br />\nwomen's studies, and the<br />\nHumanities Center is in the process of hiring an expert in<br />\nfeminist thought.<br />\nIn addition, the administration<br />\nis matching the funding of the<br />\nFord grant. In light of the current<br />\nfinancial situation, however, it<br />\nmust plan carefully to develop the<br />\nprogram. \"It is truly amazing<br />\nhow long it has taken,\" said Martin. \"Entrenched conservative<br />\nhabits of thought and slowness to<br />\nacknowledge the importance of<br />\ngendered subjects are two of the<br />\nfactors that have held us back.<br />\nWe are far behind Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, Harvard, and other<br />\nschools. There is no place that we<br />\nconsider one of our peers that is<br />\nas far behind as we are.\"<br />\nDespite Hopkins's past in the<br />\narea, Martin expressed some optimism. \"Things will change here<br />\ngradually. The tidal wave of interest cannot be held back.\"<br />\nLst year, the Women's Center<br />\ncirculated a petition asserting a<br />\nneed for more gender-related and<br />\nwomen's issues courses and requesting that the administration<br />\npay immediate attention to this<br />\narea of students' needs. With 449<br />\nsignatures, it submitted the petition to Lloyd Armstrong, dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences, last spring.<br />\nDuring the spring semester of<br />\n1987, several gender courses<br />\nwere offered. Senior Academic<br />\nAdvisor Catherine Evans and<br />\nHistory graduate student Kathleen<br />\nCanning conducted a survey of<br /><br />\nthe students in these classes.<br />\nEvans, who periodically<br />\nteaches a women writers course,<br />\nfound that \"students were very<br />\nenthusiastic about courses that<br />\nwere explicitly about gender<br />\ntopics. Most indicated a desire to<br />\ntake future courses and expressed their feelings that more classes<br />\nwere needed.\" Responses to the<br />\nsurvey included: \"these courses<br />\nhave had the most impact on me<br />\nin the way of my personal education here at Hopkins\"; and \"This<br />\nis probably the best course I've<br />\ntaken here at Hopkins in terms of<br />\npersonal development/growth.\"<br />\nResponses like these occurred<br />\noften in the survey.<br />\nA potential advantage to the<br />\ncreation of a director's position in<br />\nWomen's Studies is continuity<br />\nand consistency in offering<br />\nwomen's studies and genderrelated courses. Many of these<br />\ntypes of courses have been taught<br />\nhere, and a few are taught<br />\nregularly, but Hopkins offers no<br />\nguarantee that a reasonable selection of them will be taught a given<br />\nsemester.<br />\nThe course offerings for next<br />\nsemester are a good illustration of<br />\nthis problem. Only two specific<br />\ngender-related courses will be offered next semester, and one is a<br />\ngraduate seminar. Other courses<br />\nthat fit into the subject area are<br />\nbeing taught, but the University<br />\noffers no commitment to their being taught again.<br />\nAs noted by Ferguson, the<br />\nwomen's studies director will<br />\nsustain feeling for the ongoing<br />\ncourse area and will push for the<br />\ncourses, insuring constancy in the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the issue of<br />\nwomen's studies becomes a part<br />\nof the vast Human Climate con-<br /><br />\ncerns that have recently received<br />\nmuch attention. It is not,<br />\nhowever, only a recent issue. It<br />\nis addressed in the report of the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force, submitted in the fall of 1987, but the<br />\nsame or similar issues were addressed two years earlier in great<br />\ndepth by the Ad Hoc Committee<br />\non the Status of Women.<br />\nThat committee's report, submitted in June, 1985, outlined<br />\nstartling definitive informatiot<br />\nabout women at Hopkins in many<br /><br />\nNews-Letter file<br /><br />\nSenior academic advisor<br />\nCatherine Evans<br /><br />\nareas, including faculty hiring<br />\nand curriculum development. According to Evans, \"None of the<br />\nspecific recommendations of the<br />\ncommittee have been implemented.\" Even after the<br />\nreports were available and concrete conclusions were drawn, little definitive action was taken,<br />\nuntil now.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS CRIME REPORT<br />\nAssault<br />\n*Complainant reports that<br />\naround 1:10 a.m. on<br />\nDecember 4, while visiting in<br />\nHollander Dorm, she was<br />\nassaulted during an argument<br />\nwith another student.

We welcome<br />\nthis sign of a tangible plan which<br />\nemerges from the empty rhetoric and<br />\nreassurances spooned out to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity over the past several<br />\nmonths. As irksome as the wait has been<br />\nfor us, it has been much more frustating<br />\nfor the academic departments: they have<br />\nbeen forced to do a lot of soul-searching<br />\nand, yes, even sweating in uncertain anticipation of cuts far more drastic than<br />\nthe de facto faculty hiring freeze currently in effect.<br /><br />\nits less essential components.<br />\nWe are also cheered by the University's implicit recognition of what we consider to be self-evident\u2014academic<br />\ndepartments, the life-blood of the<br />\nUniversity, should not be sacrificed to<br />\nretain administrative ones.

At the outset I wish to<br />\nmake it very clear that the GRO<br />\ndoes not have any position on the<br />\nissues. While it is true that the<br />\nGRO discussed the issues, as they<br />\nusually discuss all campus controversies, they never voted on<br />\nany official position. Therefore,<br />\nany remarks made by the<br />\nmembers of the GRO are those of<br />\nthe respective members only.<br />\nAs was described to me, the<br />\nChaplain is entrusted with two<br />\nroles. The first is to oversee the<br />\nreligious activities on campus.<br />\nThe second is to ensure that<br />\ngroups which \"do not have a<br />\nhome in the GRO or SAC\"<br />\n([which have been perceived to be<br />\nthe] leftists) are given the opportunity to be heard on campus.<br />\nIf it is true that the Chaplain's<br />\noffice is providing a home for the<br />\n\"homeless\" politicos, then the<br />\noffice is providing a very important and necessary service to the<br />\ncampus community. Underlying<br />\nthe creation of such a mandate,<br />\nhowever, is the assumption that<br />\nthe GRO and SAC are<br />\nsystematically discriminating<br />\nagainst groups on the basis of<br />\ntheir political views. This is in<br />\nfact a very dangerous and serious<br />\naccusation. There is absolutely no<br />\nevidence that this discrimination<br />\nis taking place. In fact, almost<br />\nhalf of the GRO recognized and<br />\nsupported groups are promoting<br />\na leftist political agenda.<br />\nThe result of all of this is that<br />\nleftist groups have two sources of<br />\nfunds: the Chaplain and either the<br />\nGRO or SAC, whereas conservative groups have only one. It is<br />\nin fact systemic discrimination<br />\nagainst conservatives that is taking place.<br />\nWhen I did raise these concerns<br />\n, to the GRO I was confronted with<br />\na barrage of accusations from<br />\nMr. Kaveh Ehsani of the<br />\nGraduates for Social Responsibility, and his \"socially responsible\" cohorts that I was trying<br />\nto stifle \"progressive\" and liberal<br />\nactivities on campus. In their<br />\nreasoning the adherence to<br />\ndemocratic form in the allocation<br />\nof funds endangers their right to<br />\nfree speech, the institution of an<br />\nevents-czar does not endanger.<br />\nOurs.<br /><br />\nOussama Himani<br /><br />\nChaplain II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was very disappointed by<br />\nMartin Stemmler's article and the<br />\neditorial last week on the role of<br />\nUniversity Chaplain Gretchen<br />\nVan Utt.<br />\nFirst: as a member of the GRO,<br />\nI can say that Stemmler's wording on the results of our meeting<br />\nwere<br />\ndiscussions<br />\nand<br />\nMISLEADING and this apparently led to the misinforming<br />\nof News-Letter editors Kathleen<br />\nMcCarthy and Flory Ware. Consistently only one member of the<br />\nGRO has raised and sustained the<br /><br />\nissue of the Chaplain's bias.<br />\nOther members of the board<br />\nagreed that politics and religion<br />\nhave never been separable, and<br />\nthat the Chaplain's role as one<br />\nwho raises often uncomfortable<br />\nissues on a conservative campus<br />\nis appropriate.<br />\nSecondly, making a stink about<br />\nher underfunding the Talmudic<br />\nStudy Group is opportunistic.<br />\nThat group also presented its proposal to the GRO on September<br />\n13, and its details are important.<br />\nFirst of all, the group asked for<br />\nsome $1190.00 to purchase the<br />\nfull 30 volume Talmud ($550 plus<br />\ntax), $160 plus tax for eight individual copies of the Brachot<br />\nTalmud, and $480 for speakers<br />\nand postering. This was for a<br />\ngroup they estimated at eight people, and that they were not sure<br />\nwould continue after this<br />\nsemester. The idea of giving over<br />\none hundred dollars per person to<br />\na small study group was daunting<br />\nto the GRO, and I suspect impossible for the Chaplain's office<br />\nbudget. A further point that has<br />\nnot been mentioned by anyone is<br />\nthat a 41-volume Talmud in<br />\nHebrew and at least 20 volumes<br />\nin English are available in the<br />\nMSE library for circulation.<br />\nFinally, it is my belief that the<br />\nhubbub about the Sunday Experience poster which parodied<br />\nDan Quayle before the election is<br />\na case of \"politics are OK as long<br />\nas they are about something far<br />\nfrom home.\"<br />\nThe issue of the Chaplain's role<br />\nwas NOT raised by the religious<br />\ncommunity itself, but rather by<br />\nthe College Republicans. This<br />\nshould awaken us to the fact that<br />\ntheir renewed harassment of<br />\nGretchen Van Utt is politically<br />\nmotivated, and does in fact<br />\namount to a modern day witchhunt by them to stifle liberal<br />\nvoices at Homewood.<br /><br />\nthis responsibility has obviously<br />\nnot yet been met.<br />\nDebra Hamel<br /><br />\nChaplain IV<br />\nTo the Editors:<br /><br />\nIt is unfortunate that the College Republicans prefer to attack<br />\nthe Chaplain's office rather than<br />\nengage in a meaningful discussion<br />\nof its efforts. What bothers me<br />\nabout the latest wave of misinformation is how easily it is accepted<br />\nby the Hopkins community. For<br />\nover a year, I've heard about the<br />\nso-called political leanings of OXFAM. Yet for some reason when<br />\nthe head of OXFAM USA spoke at<br />\nHopkins, not one of the parties<br />\nthat object to Oxfam's policies<br />\nshowed up. I had heard about the<br />\nspeech through the normal<br />\nsources, having spotted posters<br />\nall over the walls around campus.<br />\nI had hoped that the community<br />\nwould finally have an opportunity to address some of the real<br />\nissues and so-called controversies<br />\nthat involve Oxfam. Unfortunately, Greg Francis and Tom Corlett of the College Republicans<br />\nseem to prefer public slander as<br />\na way of making the campus<br />\nmore aware. Fellas, if you<br />\nwanted to address the issues,<br />\nGretchen Van Utt brough the<br />\nhead honcho of the whole damn<br />\norganization to Gilman Hall.<br />\nWhere were you? And why, if<br />\nthis issue concerns you so much,<br />\ndidn't our esteemed News-Letter<br />\neditors send a reporter to objectively cover the issues involved.<br />\nInstead the editors do us a disservice by perpetuating a series of<br />\nmyths about \"controversial<br />\nPolitical links.\" I've come to my<br />\nown conclusions about the<br />\nrelative worth of Oxfam, but my<br />\nideas were developed by confronting the issues directly, not<br />\nassuming that whatever<br />\nthrough<br />\nTimmons Roberts<br />\nDepartment of Sociology the College Republicans happen<br />\nto espouse is the truth.<br /><br />\nChaplain III<br />\nJustin Schein<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI wanted to compliment the<br />\nauthors of the News-Letter<br />\neditorial of last week for properly rebuking Chaplain Gretchen<br />\nVan Utt for her leftist priorities.<br />\nThe responsibility of a chaplain<br />\nis to the spiritual health of the<br />\nUniversity community. It is<br />\nneither her responsibility nor is it<br />\nproper for her to address political<br />\nissues at the expense of inherently spiritual matters. This is<br />\nespecially true as the office has a<br />\nlimited budget, and money offered, for example, to a political<br />\nguest lecturer such as Abbie<br />\nHoffman would be better spent on<br />\nreligious concerns.<br />\nIt is not valid to argue in this<br />\ninstance that political lectures are<br />\nimportant and.educational and are<br />\nthus a benefit to the school community. This is obviously true,<br />\nbut is also sophistry. Hopkins<br />\nsponsors lectures at which Abbie<br />\nHoffman would be a perfectly appropriate speaker, but these lectures should not be funded by the<br />\nChaplain's office, the primary<br />\nresponsibility of which is to care<br />\nfor the spiritual needs of the community. Given that the chaplain<br />\nfailed because of lack of funds to<br />\nsponsor Talmudic reading series,<br /><br />\nChaplain V<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhat is the source of the \"long<br />\ncontroversy\" surrounding the<br />\nChaplain's Office? It has two<br />\nsources: Gregory Francis, president of the College Republicans,<br />\nand Oussama Himani, a graduate student active in the<br />\nGraduate Representative Organization. Himani is not the GRO,<br />\nnor is he \"members of ' the<br />\nGRO. But through the good offices of the News-Letter these two<br />\nnow have the appearance of a<br />\nmass movement.<br />\nOne charge is cause for concern. Himani accuses the<br />\nChaplain of \"ignoring her own<br />\npromise\" concerning OXFAM<br />\nand the anti-hunger fast. The<br />\nsame issue of the News-Letter<br />\nfeatures a reminder about the fast<br />\nadvertising Manna House of<br />\nBaltimore as an alternative charity to OXFAM. OXFAM is<br />\nsuspect for Himani and the College Republicans because it is not<br />\n\"politically neutral,\" that is,<br />\nbecause it thinks that hunger<br />\nmight have some relationship to<br />\nfood production and distribution.<br />\nBut Van Utt kept her promise.<br /><br />\nHimani should check his facts sider this white, Anglo-Saxon,<br />\nbefore making such serious Protestant male's sensitivity. I<br />\ncharges.<br />\ndon't just mean that the lad has<br />\nThat Himani and Francis a problem understanding how to<br />\nshould mount an attack on the refer to an adult female -politics of the Chaplain's Office woman is the word, boy -- but<br />\ncomes as no surprise. They have his calling for Liddy to debate<br />\nclear, coherent agendas. Why, Hoffman. Sure G. Gordon's an<br />\nthough, is the News-Letter so amusing lunatic, but that's only<br />\nready to forge a consensus out of the<br />\nIn<br />\nhis<br />\nbeginning.<br />\ntheir views?

But perhaps I misundershave something to say about the tand. Maybe the CR's aren't<br />\n\"biased\" character of shuttle ad- racist or anti-semitic, just<br />\nvocacy. And we might, if asked, disingenuous.<br />\nhave something to say about the<br />\n\"bias' of former government ofSidney Maskit<br />\nficials sponsored by the SAC to<br />\ndebate narrowly framed questions<br />\nChaplain VII<br />\nof \"terrorism\" or the national<br />\nbudget.

If<br />\nit is not too unbecoming of me<br />\nto say so, I am very disappointed<br />\nin the apparent apathy by the administration on the subject of<br />\nsecurity. Of course, there are the<br />\nsecurity escort sevices, and<br />\npatrolling security men on campus, but they are not enough. This<br />\nyear I am responsible for the enforcement of the University's<br />\nalcohol policy in my dorm, and<br />\nduring Housemaster training this<br />\nyear, we were all drilled time and<br />\ntime again, with the fact that we<br />\nhad to do all we could to eliminate<br />\nalcohol from the dorms partly to<br />\ncover the University's liability.By<br />\nprotecting the health of our<br />\nfreshmen, we also protect the<br />\nUniversity's ass from lawsuits. If<br />\ngenuine concern for everyone's<br />\nwell being is not enough for the<br />\nUniversity to have such a dry<br />\ncampus policy, then money most<br />\ncertainly is.

In case you don't<br />\nremember, we held a Volleyball<br />\ntournament and fundraiser on the<br />\nquad during SpringFest. Even<br />\nthough this all took place right<br />\nbefore finals and summer vacation, a wide variety of different<br />\nstudent groups collected over<br />\n$1,350 for Save the Children, a<br />\nprivate non-partisan relief<br />\norganization based in Connecticut. This money will go to relief<br />\nin poverty striken communities all<br />\nover the world (including the<br />\nU.S.) Each Hopkins group that<br />\nraised a certain amount of money<br />\nhas sponsored an individual child<br />\nin one of Save The Children's<br />\ncommunities.<br />\nThis project would not have<br />\ngotten started without the help of .<br />\nJoe Sokolowski and the IFC. We<br />\nappreciate the work of the seven<br />\nfrats who contributed: Alpha Phi,<br />\nPhi Psi, Phi Mu, TEP, ATO,<br />\nWawa, and the \"ex SigEp/Golden Hearts.\" Also to be<br />\nrecognized are the smaller student<br />\ngroups that organized to raise<br />\nmoney and play volleyball, most<br />\nnotably the Catholic Community,<br />\nMiddle East Students Association<br />\nand Progressive Students Union.<br />\nPerhaps the most surprising<br />\nand rewarding aspect of the day<br />\nwas seeing different students<br />\nwho've never met spend an afternoon playing volleyball in the<br />\nsun, while raising money for a<br />\ngood cause.

When you move to the window and throw open the curtains,<br />\nhowever, you find that you are no<br />\nlonger in a room on the Charles<br />\nStreet side of Wolman Hall.<br />\nYou are looking down over the<br />\ncosmopolitan city of Bologna.<br />\nBefore you are the ancient towers<br />\nand basilicas of the city and the<br />\nmore modern skyline, and<br />\nbeyond that rise the Appenines<br />\nmountains. Nearby is the school<br />\nyou attend, where you are taught<br />\ngraduate courses in International<br />\nRelations, Economics, History,<br />\nand Political Science by a faculty of international experts, while<br />\naround you are students from<br />\nother countries as well.<br />\nIf this situation sounds appealing, then keep reading. Each<br />\nyear, the Johns Hopkins School<br />\nfor Advanced International<br />\nStudies makes it possible for six<br />\nto ten juniors to study at the<br />\nSchool in Bologna, Italy, allowing them to take graduate-level<br />\ncourses in a variety of subjects in<br />\nthe social sciences in the center<br />\nof European activity.<br /><br />\nThe program, which lasts a full<br />\nacademic year from fall to spring,<br />\nbegins with a 5-week intensive<br />\nItalian conversation class to help<br />\nstudents adjust to their new environment. Afterwards, the<br />\nclasses themselves are all taught<br />\nin English, in subjects ranging<br />\nfrom international relations to<br />\neconomics to political science.<br />\nAll grades go directly onto the<br />\nstudent's transcript, and there are<br />\nno difficulties in transferring<br /><br />\nYou are looking down<br />\nover the cosmopolitan<br />\ncity of Bologna. Before<br />\nyou are the ancient<br />\ntowers and basilicas of<br />\nthe city and the more<br />\nmodern skyline, and<br />\nbeyond that rise the<br />\nAppenines mountains.<br />\ncredits, or distribution and major<br />\nrequirements. The coursework<br />\nitself, however, is very different<br />\nand requires independent<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\n\"It's very unstructured,\" says<br />\nsenior Kim McCormack, who attended the school last year. \"You<br />\nare given a goal and a few basic<br />\nguidelines, and told to go with<br />\nit.<br /><br />\nJohn Misa<br /><br />\nAndy Richman, who spent part of last year in Bologna, Italy, says, \"I<br />\nfeel that studying abroad is an experience that will stay with me the rest<br />\nof my life.\"<br /><br />\nCourtesy of Academic Advising<br /><br />\nImagine waking up in the morning to a scene like this instead of a picturesque view of CVP. This is one of<br />\nthe perks of studying at the Bologna Center in Italy.<br />\nAccording to senior Jon Aronson, who also participated last<br />\nyear, the workload is comparable<br />\nto that at Homewood, although on<br />\na graduate level.<br />\n\"The classes meet about once<br />\na week,\" he says, \"but there is<br />\nan extensive reading list.\"<br />\nStudents say that the program<br />\nprovides an opportunity to take<br />\npart in serious graduate study<br />\nfirst-hand, in an environment<br />\ncourseideal for such<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe immersion in the culture<br />\nand lifestyle of Bologna, with its<br />\ninternational population, also has<br />\nits benefits. As only 60 of 140<br />\nstudents at the school are<br />\nAmerican, it provides a chance to<br />\nmeet students from all over the<br />\nworld and exchange ideas.<br />\n\"I roomed with students from<br />\nAustria, Belgium, Great Britain,<br />\nand Egypt,\" says Aronson.<br />\n\"These students are at the<br />\ngraduate level, and openly express their opinions. There's a lot<br />\nof dialogue, and this gives you an<br />\nextensive picture of international<br />\nviews.\"<br />\nItaly's relatively central position in Europe also allows for<br />\ntravel in countries from Spain to<br />\nPoland over academic breaks.<br />\nAnd with Florence, Milan,<br />\nRome, and Venice all within a<br />\nfew hours' travel, a student has<br />\na chance to take in Italian culture,<br />\nhistory, and art.<br />\n\"Bologna itself,\" says Aronson, \"is a great city to be in. It's<br />\nnot really tarnished by tourism,<br />\nso it retains its own culture. And<br />\nthe Italians are helpful, and don't<br />\nreally mind if you don't speak<br />\nfluently.\"<br />\nMcCormack says that she<br />\nfound the Italians friendly and<br />\noutgoing as well, and that the environment, although it served as<br />\na social eye-opener in some<br />\nrespects, really made the program<br />\nwhat it is.<br />\nThe process for entering the<br />\nBologna School is competitive.<br />\nWhile most of the students that<br />\napply are in the social sciences,<br />\nanyone is eligible if they have at<br />\nleast a background in micro- and<br />\nmacro-economics, with some<br /><br />\nHistory of Occidental Civilization<br />\npreferred. The application consists of a letter stating why admittance to the program is desired<br />\nand how it fits with the educational objectives of the applicant,<br />\nalong with a transcript, and a letter of endorsement from the student's faculty advisor, stating<br />\nwhy the Bologna program would<br />\nenrich the student's academic<br />\nprogram. Applications are due<br />\nFebruary 24, 1989, for the term<br />\nbeginning in fall 1989, and subsequent interviews are performed<br />\nby the Office of Academic Advising, with a SAIS representative<br />\npresent.<br />\n\"Students that apply should be<br />\ninterested in European studies,\"<br />\nsays Dr. James Goodyear of the<br />\nAdvising Office. \"We are looking for students with commitment, appropriate coursework,<br />\nand those that are mature and<br />\nready to go abroad.\"<br />\nParticipating students agree<br />\nneeds certain<br />\nthat one<br />\ncharacteristics to perform well in<br /><br />\nthe program. -Because of the<br />\nacademic freedom,\" says<br />\nMcCormack, \"students need a lot<br />\nof self-discipline, a sense of<br />\nadventure, a sense of humor, an<br />\nopen mind, and have to be good<br />\ncommunicators.\"<br />\nDr. Goodyear agrees that the<br />\nprogram is challenging, but also<br />\ndistinctly rewarding. \"It is completely different culture and<br />\neducational milieu. The program<br />\ndevelops and transforms students.<br />\nThey gain a different sense of<br />\nthemselves, of education, and of<br />\nthe world in general.\"<br />\nIf you're interested in more information, there is a general<br />\nmeeting at 3 p.m. in the<br />\nAcademic Advising Office.

Crude as it is, this conceit could have acted as an effective metaphor for authordeveloping in<br />\nitarianism<br />\nAmerican culture. The aliens are<br />\ngreedy, cruel, and efficient<br />\ncapitalists, distracting the working classes with entertainments<br />\nand fashions, exploiting them for<br />\ntheir own financial gain\u2014\"just<br />\ndoing business.\" And the humans<br />\nare content with their hopeless<br />\ndelusions, asleep in the American<br />\nDream, and completely blind to<br />\nthe entire conspiracy. \"Blind\"<br />\nbecause everything appears to be<br />\nexactly as it has always been,<br /><br />\nunless you wear these cool dark<br />\nglasses developed by the<br />\nUnderground. When you wear<br />\nthe glasses, the false faces and<br />\nadvertisements fall away, all appearances and dreams disappear,<br />\nand everything is in black and<br />\nwhite. Behind the features of the<br />\naffluent and fashionable are bugeyed death's-head alien faces.<br />\nBeneath the billboards and advertisements are bold commands to<br />\nSLEEP, CONFORM, OBEY,<br />\nand CONSUME. DO NOT<br />\nQUESTION AUTHORITY. NO<br />\nIMAGINATION. WATCH<br />\nTELEVISION. These are, of<br />\ncourse, the commands most<br />\nentertainments and advertisements communicate to us<br />\nevery day. And dollar bills bear<br />\nthe dictate THIS IS YOUR GOD,<br />\nnot all that different from \"In<br />\nGod We Trust.\" For the first few<br />\nminutes of the film I honestly<br />\nhoped that They Live would be a<br /><br />\nEighties, exposing the complacency, avarice, consumerism,<br />\nescapism, and blind deference to<br />\nauthority which have characterized this decade. Yes, it is explicitly, blatantly done. Yes, the acting<br />\nis bad. And yes, the alien faces<br />\nare cheap Halloween masks. But,<br />\nall that could have been excused<br />\nif the film's ideas had been at all<br />\ndeveloped.<br />\nIt's as if some gifted, uncredited screenwriter developed<br />\nthe treatment for the film, but was<br />\nbeaten to death by John Carpenter<br />\nand a brutal gang of Hollywood<br />\nhacks who escaped with his idea<br />\nand decided that they could<br />\nrewrite it into a \"commercial<br />\nfilm\" by making the hero \"more<br />\ndecisive, more aggressive,\" cutting out all that boring stuff about<br />\nauthority and freedom, and having some big cool fights and gun<br />\nbattles.<br /><br />\nsa)<br />\n0<br /><br />\nGRAMT1 FROM THE AONSCIOUS,<br />\nHEALTHY NONSMOKERS!!<br />\nNEED EXTRA CASH?

The most elegant of these<br />\nvigilante programs, as reported<br />\nby Time magazine, is the Brain<br />\nvirus.

Vaccines have<br />\nbeen successful against smallpox,<br />\npolio, measles, and other viral<br />\ndiseases. However, the development of a vaccine against the<br />\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus<br />\n(HIV), which causes AIDS, has<br />\nbeen surprisingly difficult.<br />\nVaccines rally the body's immune response against the<br />\ndisease-causing organism, the<br />\npathogen. When a pathogen invades the body, the immune<br />\nsystem directs cells and antibodies against an antigen. which<br />\nis an exposed part of the<br />\npathogen's surface. Certain cells<br />\nof the immune system, known as<br />\nT4 helper cells, generated during this encounter, \"remember\"<br />\nthe antigen and prevent another<br />\ninfection by invoking a swifter<br />\nand a more potent immune<br />\nresponse the next time the<br />\npathogen invades. The immune<br />\nresponse produces antibodies<br />\nagainst a specific antigen and<br />\ndoes not attack other antigens.<br />\nVaccines introduce harmless<br />\nversions of pathogens to the immune system. The immune system<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nreacts to the harmless versions as<br />\nthough they were the real<br />\npathogen, and activates its T4<br />\nhelper cells. In AIDS, however,<br />\nHIV's primary target are T4<br />\ncells. T4 cells infected with HIV<br />\ncannot activate an immune<br />\nresponse against the virus. An<br />\nAIDS vaccine must prevent the<br />\nvirus from infecting T4 cells.<br />\nThe AIDS vaccine would also<br />\nhave to halt the virus before it invades the central nervous system,<br />\nwhere pathogens are invulnerable<br />\nto immune attack, because cells<br />\nof the immune system cannot<br />\neasily diffuse across the bloodbrain barrier. The AIDS vaccine<br />\nwould also have to recognize all<br />\nHIV variants. Most importantly,<br />\nthe vaccine must carry no risk of<br />\nitself causing AIDS.<br />\nHIV is a retrovirus and, like<br />\nother viruses, it inserts its genes<br />\ninto the infected cell's genes.<br />\nUnlike other viruses, however,<br />\nretroviral genes can be dormant<br />\nfor long periods of time; the infected cell may remain invisible<br />\nto the immune system because the<br />\ngenes are not expressed as proteins that form the surface antigens. Hence, total eradication of<br />\na retroviral infection is virtually<br />\nimpossible<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nTrerarnffen-or-Hopkins Affiliates<br />\nPAY NO RENT<br /><br />\n'till January 1989<br />\nROLAND RIDGE<br />\nAPARTMENTS<br />\nACT NOM...<br /><br />\n2 Months FREE RENT<br />\nLarge 1 and 2 Bedroom<br />\nApartments<br />\n...Limited Number Available....<br />\nCALL NOW<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nCLASSIFIEDS<br /><br />\nYOU QUALIFY FOR<br />\nINSTANT CREDIT!.

For example, gp120 proteins, found on the surface of both<br />\nthe virus and infected cells, provide a likely antigen target for antibodies. But HIV continuaaly<br />\nvaries gp120's structure, making<br />\nantigen-specific vaccines useless.<br />\nHIV infects cells by binding to<br />\none of the gp120 cell surface proteins, called CD4. To prevent infection, vaccines must impede<br />\nHIV from binding to CD4. Vaccines can supply antibodies that<br />\nresemble CD4 and thus bind to all<br />\nthe virus's CD4 receptor sites<br />\npreventing it from infecting cells.<br />\nBut CD4-like antibodies are<br />\nforeign to the body and provoke<br />\nan \"autoimmune response\"<br />\nwhich produces antibodies<br />\nagainst the first antibody. The<br />\nanti-antibodies can attack CD4<br />\nand destroy the very cells that the<br />\nfirst antibody tries to protect.<br />\nAn AIDS vaccine must take<br />\nthese properties into account in<br />\norder to find the HIV's Achilles<br />\nheel. HIV is not invulnerable:<br />\ncomponents of the immune<br />\nsystem have a proven ability to<br />\nneutralize the virus in the test<br />\ntube. People infected with HIV<br />\ninitially launch a strong antibody<br />\nand killer cell assault on the virus.<br />\nThese defenses hold the virus in<br />\ncheck for years, but the people<br />\neventually develop AIDS. The<br />\nimmune system fights back; it just<br />\ndoes not fight hard enough.<br />\nThe trick is to discover whichi<br />\npart of the HIV elicits the most<br />\npowerful immune response and<br />\namplify that response to overcome the virus. Most researchers<br />\nbelieve that the best site is on the<br />\nviral surface protein gp120.<br />\nMuch of gp120 is hidden from<br />\nimmunological sight by a cloud of<br />\nsugar molecules. A cleft where<br />\nthe virus binds to CD4 and a loop<br />\nhat that protrudes above the sugar<br />\ncloud, are two of gp120's exposed regions. The CD4 binding<br />\ncleft is vital to the virus's function and is invariant among<br />\nviruses. But this antigenic site, as<br />\nmentioned before, causes an<br />\nautoimmune response.<br />\nOn the other hand, the loop can<br />\nbe easily recognized and does not<br />\nelicit an autoimmune response.<br /><br />\nBut the loop is one of the most<br />\nvariable regions of the protein.<br />\nVariability enables the loop to<br />\ndodge the response it invoked; a<br />\nsingle change in the protein structure creates a different antibody<br />\nspecificity. Researchers are<br />\nworking on a vaccine that can anticipate and destroy all mutated<br />\nforms.<br />\nEvan as research on vaccine<br />\nstrategies goes on, a number of<br />\nAIDS vaccines are being tested in<br />\nhumans. The efficacy of the<br />\nclinical trials is unknown because<br />\nof the short time since their inception. Also, unlike other human<br />\nviral diseases, HIV does not attack animals. Most animals don't<br />\nget AIDS, even when injected<br />\nwith HIV; no one knows why.<br />\nLack of a good animal model with<br />\nHIV means that the only way to<br />\ntest a vaccine's efficacy is to try<br />\nit on humans. Understandably,<br />\nthere is shortage of volunteers to<br />\ntry a vaccine with no known efficacy that carries a risk of<br />\ncausing AIDS.<br />\nTraditional vaccines that use<br />\nkilled or weakened virus are<br />\navoided because of the risks<br />\nassociated with innoculating<br />\nwhole HIV's. Most of the vaccine<br />\ntrials employ a piece of HIV, like<br />\ngp120, as antigens. To ensure<br />\nthat the immune system sees the<br />\nantigen, the protein is cornplexed with large compounds like<br />\nalum. Results gathered so far<br />\nhave been ambiguous, but doctors<br />\nbelieve that use of an antigen<br />\ncomplex with artificial membranes like liposomes, instead of<br />\nalum, may improve performance. The most impressive<br />\nresults to date have been obtained from the use of a similar complex with weakened cow pox<br />\nvirus. Innoculation is followed by<br />\nweekly boosters of gp120 precursors and uninfected T cells from<br />\nan AIDS patient, to amplify<br />\nresponse to levels high enough to<br />\nbe considered immune. Booster<br />\ndosage varies depending upon the<br />\nimmune system's response,<br />\nwhich must be measured every<br />\nweek. This test was the first use<br />\nof an AIDS vaccine in humans;<br />\nhead researcher Daniel Zagury<br />\ntook many by surprise when he<br /><br />\ninnoculated himself along with<br />\nthe first volunteers in November<br />\n1986. This vaccine works, but it<br />\nis too complicated to administer<br />\nto humans en masse. It does,<br />\nhowever, demonstrate that immunity to HIV could be achieved in humans.<br />\nAnother trial has a subunit vaccine based on another internal<br />\ncomponent of the virus which is<br />\nnot a gp120 protein. HGP-30 vaccine mimics a protein that lines<br />\nthe inside of HIV's surface and<br />\ninduces the body to produce antibodies against it. The protein is<br />\nexposed to immune attack when<br />\nHIV attacks a cell. HGP-30 has<br />\nhad encouraging results and<br />\nawaits approval of the FDA for<br />\nmass testing.<br />\nIn another trial in England,<br />\nresearchers innoculate an<br />\nuninfected blood sample with antibodies against the CD4 protein.<br />\nThis causes blood to develop its<br />\nown anti-antibodies that resemble<br />\nCD4. These CD4-like antobodies, which can compete with<br />\ncells in binding HIV, are isolated<br />\nand injected into uninfected people. This procedure avoids an<br />\nauto-immune response and ensures that fewer cells are infected<br />\nwith HIV, as most of the free<br />\nvirus is tied up by the antibodies.<br />\nNo preliminary results have been<br />\ntibodies, but this approach looks<br />\npromising.<br />\nMost of these AIDS vaccines<br />\nhave yet to be proven on a large<br />\nscale. Over twenty-five hundred<br />\nscientists in Africa, Europe, and<br />\nthe Americas are currently engaged in the effort to develop an<br />\nAIDS vaccine. The United States<br />\nfederal budget provides over two<br />\nbillion dollars for research on an<br />\nAIDS vaccine alone. Government, industry, and academic<br />\nresearch efforts are being coordinated, under the aegis of the<br />\nNational Cooperative Vaccine<br />\nDevelopment Groups, to pool expertise in a multitude of virus<br />\ntypes, in the mechanisms of gene<br />\nregulation, and in the workings of<br />\nthe immune system. It is hoped<br />\nthat HIV cannot outwit such a<br />\ncombination.<br /><br />\nEngineering honors<br />\nby Sonia Marx<br />\nTau Beta Pi is the national<br />\nengineering honor society,<br />\nestablished<br />\nin<br />\n1885 to<br />\nacknowledge high academic<br />\nachievement and exemplary<br />\ncharacter.

This question and many others are<br />\nanswered in What Can I Do With<br />\nMy Microwave?<br />\nRuth Spear, a freelance food<br />\nwriter, has compiled 270 different tips about microwaves.<br />\nThese tips include how to choose<br />\na microwave, as well as its<br />\nmaintenance. There are also sections which are divided as to<br />\ncooking method, i.e. braising or<br />\npoaching, and as to type of food<br />\ncooked. This division of topics<br />\nenables quick reference.<br />\nThe book's practical use for a<br />\nHopkins student varies widely on<br />\nthe person who might refer to it.<br />\nIt contains many basic facts about<br />\nmechanics of how<br />\nthe<br />\nmicrowaves cook and the consequences that might result from<br />\nnot being aware of the differences<br />\nin microwave cooking versus<br />\nconventional cooking. For instance, according to Spear,<br /><br />\nmicrowaves cook from the outside in, but tend to penetrate a.<br />\nfinite distance into the food, relying on transfer of heat within the<br />\nfood to cook the innermost portions. Because microwaves don't<br />\nhave to heat the food to cook it,<br />\nthis transfer of heat often lags<br />\nbehind the actual oven time<br />\nprescribed. As a result,<br />\nmicrowave-cooked food requires<br />\nstanding time. While this fact<br />\nmight seem obvious to the more<br />\ncosmopolitan gourmet, it is useful<br />\ninformation to the novice.<br />\nHowever, the book contains<br />\nseveral hints which indicate<br />\nusefulness for a more experienced or sophisticated cook. Included, for example, is a method<br />\nto soften unripe avocados for<br />\nguacamole, as well as pointers for<br />\nadapting favorite conventional<br />\nrecipes to those which work in the<br />\nmicrowave. Problems in adapting<br />\nmight result from not changing<br />\nthe spicing or the moisture content in the microwave recipe.<br />\nAlso, sauces that are made with<br />\nmilk or eggs tend to behave differently in the microwave than<br />\nwhen cooked conventionally.<br /><br />\n57FOR C00KING4A0<br />\ntv40,9e.<br /><br />\nIhmi<br />\ntiS\\<br /><br />\nCAN I DO WM MY<br /><br />\n270<br /><br />\nAMAZING TIPS ANO IDEAS\\\\<br />\nTHAT SHOW YOU HOW ID<br />\nMAKE THE MOST OF YOUR<br />\nMIRACLE APPLIANCE<br />\nDELL-`,'<br /><br />\n'\u2022U S $395<br />\nC.AN<br /><br />\nFurthermore, there are many<br />\nwho eschew cooking in the<br />\nmicrowave because the texture<br />\nand color of certain foods, like<br />\nbreads or meats, aren't quite the<br />\nsame as cooking them conventionally.

He jiggled his knee in time<br />\nwith the music someone was playing<br />\non the jukebox. When the music stopped his knee kept going. He played<br />\n,with his straw, rolling it into a spiral,<br />\nthen unrolling it and chewing its ends.<br />\nIt wheezed through a slit in its side<br />\nwhen he tried to drink through it.<br />\nThe waitress who had taken his<br />\norder brought a grillP,<br />\n..1 ,neese and<br />\nbacon sandwich io the table. Stuart<br />\nsmiled. He considered mentioning that<br />\nhe had ordered a cheeseburger, but<br />\nsaid nothing. He hated bacon. Between bites he guzzled his milk, trying<br />\nunsuccessfully to drown the taste.<br />\nThe waitress came back half a sandwich later. She had brought Stuart's<br />\ncheeseburger to a woman who promptly mentioned the mistake.<br />\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said to him. \"I<br />\nforgot you ordered a cheeseburger.\"<br />\n\"No problem. I don't mind this.\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"Are you sure I can't get you one<br />\nnow?\"<br />\n\"No, really,\" he said. \"This is fine.\"<br />\nHe ordered another milk. She hurried off to get it.<br />\nA fat woman in a flowered polyester<br />\nshirt was sitting in a nearby booth. She<br />\nstruck a match. Stuart smelled the<br />\nsulfur. She lit a cigarette and held it<br />\nbetween thick fingers. Her other hand<br />\nrested on the table next to a notice that<br />\niread, \"Thank You For Not Smoking.\"<br />\nA similar notice was on Stuart's table.<br />\nHe pushed it with his elbow to where<br />\nshe could see it. She kept smoking.<br />\nThe smoke curled and danced and<br />\nfinally found him. It hovered over his<br />\nmilk and grilled cheese. It coated his<br />\nsinuses. Breathing became difficult.<br />\n\"Excuse me,\" the fat woman called<br />\nover to him. \"Do you have an<br />\nashtray?\"<br />\n\"No,\" he said. \"I'm sorry. I don't.\"<br /><br />\nShe got one from another table.<br />\nStuart hurried to finish his lunch and<br />\nescape the smoke. He left the' diner,<br />\nhoping the fresh air would help his<br />\nbreathing. Instead, the sudden cold<br />\nmade it worse. He stopped on the<br />\nsidewalk, overcome by asthma. Two<br />\nbreaths from the inhaler he always carried cleared his lungs.<br />\nHe put the inhaler back in his coat<br />\npocket and walked to the bus stop. A<br />\nyoung woman was standing there. Her<br />\nLabrador retriever was sniffing the<br />\nbase of a telephone pole.<br />\n\"Do you know the time?\" she said<br />\nto him.<br />\n\"I think it's about one-thirty, but I'm<br />\nnot really sure,\" he said.<br />\nThe dog began to smell Stuart's<br />\nknee. He bent and pet the coarse, tan<br />\nhair on its back.<br />\n\"A beautiful animal. He can't be<br />\nvery old,\" he said.<br />\n\"Six months.\"<br />\n\"He's already huge. I had one<br />\nmyself once.\"<br />\nThe dog's snout moved up Stuart's<br />\nleg. Stuart pushed the nose back dowrr<br />\nto his knee.<br />\n\"My Lab just never seemed very<br />\nsmart,\" he said.<br />\nThe dog wrapped his left paw<br />\naround Stuart's leg. Stuart stepped<br />\nback. The woman said,\"No, Trooper!\"<br />\nand pulled him back by the leash.<br />\n\"He's very affectionate, though,\"<br />\nshe said.<br />\n\"So I see.\"<br />\nThe dog jumped up and wrapped<br />\nboth front paws around Stuart's knee.<br />\n\"Get down, Trooper! Get down,\"<br />\nshe said. She pulled him off Stuart's<br />\nleg, then stepped back.<br />\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said. \"I think I'd<br />\nbetter get him away from you.\"<br />\n\"It's okay. Dogs will be dogs,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nShe smiled and walked away. The<br />\ndog ran ahead of her, straining at the<br /><br />\nleash.<br />\nStuart tried to clean the muddy paw<br />\nprints from his pants. He rubbed them<br />\nvigorously with handfuls of snow.<br />\nWhen his hands could no longer bear<br />\nthe cold, he stopped. He stuffed them<br />\nin his pockets. His legs froze beneath<br />\nthe wet spots iri his pants. He looked<br />\nback longingly at the diner, wishing he<br />\ncould wait inside. The door opened.<br />\nThe fat woman was leaving. She<br />\nstepped gingerly down the icy stairs.<br />\nWalking toward her car, she adjusted<br />\nher bra. She slipped a hand in the neck<br />\nof her flowered polyester shirt and dug<br />\nthe wide straps from grooves in her<br />\nshoulders. Her car was parked near<br />\nwhere Stuart stood. She recognized<br />\nhim.<br />\n\"Where you headed?\" she said,<br />\nstanding by her car door.<br />\n\"I'm just taking the bus,\" he said.<br />\n\"Where to? You've got a long wait.\"<br />\n\"Down to the green. I think the bus<br />\nwill be here soon,\" he said.<br />\n\"It's every hour on Saturdays.<br />\nYou've got a half hour wait.\"<br />\nStuart frowned and looked down the<br />\nstreet.<br />\n\"If you want a ride I'm heading that<br />\nway,\" she said.<br />\nHe hesitated, thinking of his asthma<br />\nand her cigarettes. Unable to think of<br />\nan excuse, he thanked her and accepted the offer.<br />\nStuart waited in the car while the<br />\nwoman cleared snow from the windows. He sat with his arms folded,<br />\navoiding her glances by staring at the<br />\ndashboard. A tobacco-stained statue<br />\nof Jesus stared back. The woman<br />\nopened the car door. The seat jumped<br />\nwhen she sat down.<br />\n\"My name's Mary,\" she said. She.<br />\nwas smiling broadly, her teeth as<br />\nyellowed as the Jesus statue. \"So tell<br />\nme where you live near the green. I used to live there myself until I moved<br />\nthree years ago. I know the area like<br /><br />\nthe back Of-My hand.\"<br />\nHe glanced at her plump hand. \"It's<br />\non the corner of Park and George<br />\nStreet,\" he said. \"A two-story house.<br />\nBrown.\"<br />\n\"Oh yes, I know the one,\" she said.<br />\n\"Always lit up like a firecracker around<br />\nChristmas time. You people must love<br />\nthe holidays.\"<br />\nHe smiled. She nosed her way into<br />\nthe traffic.<br />\n\"Do you always take the bus?\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"No, I dropped my car off at the<br />\ngarage this morning. I hate the bus.\"<br />\n\"That's why I have my baby here,\"<br />\nshe said patting the dashboard.\"Hardly caused me a problem yet.\"<br />\nThe number of pedestrians increased as they neared the city. Stuart<br />\nwatched them out the window. Mary<br />\nglanced at them as well, commenting<br />\non anyone she found interesting.<br />\nWhen they stopped at a light, Mary<br />\nreached a hand in her pocketbook.<br />\nShe pulled out a cigarette, then<br />\npointed it at two men standing hand in<br />\nhand on the corner. \"Get a load of<br />\nthose two,\" she said. Stuart looked at<br />\nthem, the cigarette wavering inches<br />\nfrom his nose. She drove past the men<br />\nand lit the cigarette. Stuart opened the<br />\nwindow a crack to survive the last mile<br />\nto his house. Mary did not notice his<br />\ndiscomfort. She watched a man jogging. \"I hope he's happy,\" she said.<br />\nThey turned the corner and Mary<br />\npointed again. Three bearded Jewish<br />\nmen were walking down the street in<br />\nlong coats and black hats.<br />\n\"There's a funny joke about them,\"<br />\nshe said. She started laughing before<br />\nshe told it. Her face grew red from<br />\nlaughing. Her eyes teared. She slapped a hand on her thigh. Her laugh<br />\nturned to a cough that dislodged the<br />\nmucus in her throat. She was still<br />\nlaughing when she pulled up in front<br />\nof Stuart's house.<br /><br />\n18/DECEMBER 9, 1988<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nEnfield three-pointer lifts Hopkins over Widener<br />\n4-2<br />\nSophomore guard scores 24 points and nets 5 three-pointers in 67-64 victory as Jays improve to<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWashington College by one<br />\n\u2022<br />\npoint.

The victory<br />\nover Wesleyan is an important<br />\none because the Blue Jays will<br />\nmost likely tangle with their New<br />\nEngland foes at the Howe Cut Intercollegiate Championships in<br />\nFebruary.<br />\nIn the match versus Hamilton,<br />\nwhile the rookies provided the<br />\nnumbers for the win, Hopkins's<br />\ntop seeds had to face Hamilton's<br />\nbest. Emmick lost 3-0 as Hart lost<br />\n15-7, 15-5, 15-14 and Collins fell<br /><br />\n15-7, 15-8, 15-8. Ng lost 16-18,<br />\n15-17, 15-10, 13-15, 15-7; Gaffney Won 15-8, 15-8, 15-9; Dorr<br />\nwon 15-9, 17-14, 15-10; Philips<br />\nwon 15-6, 15-5, 15-4; Harwood<br />\nwon 15-1, 15-4, 12-15, 15-4.<br />\nBeating Hamilton was a significant achievement for Hopkins.<br />\nNot only did the freshmen gain<br />\nconfidence in their own tremendously improving play, but the<br />\nteam proved to themselves that<br />\nthey can compete with any team<br />\nin intercollegiate squash,<br />\nregardless of division rankings.<br />\nAfter a victory-filled Saturday,<br />\nSunday was a day of discouragement and frustration for Hopkins.<br />\nThe first loss was to Colgate, 9-0.<br />\nSenior Alice Collins took her<br />\nmatch to five games and<br />\nGoodyear praised Chris Emmick's play as \"solid.\" The tired<br />\nJays proved no match for the Cornell squad and also lost 9-0. Only junior Kathryn Ng and<br />\nfreshman Tara Dorr won any<br />\ngames off of their Big Red opponents. According to Coach<br />\nGoodyear, Dorr came close to<br />\npulling off a major upset and<br />\nKathy Hart played strongly in one<br />\nof her best performances ever. In<br />\nboth of these matches, Hopkins<br />\nsuccumbed to their own mental<br />\nmistakes rather than to superior<br />\nplay on the part of their opponents. The matches against<br />\nColgate and Cornell were disapCoach<br />\nbecause<br />\npointing<br />\nGoodyear believes that his<br />\nplayers allowed themselves to<br />\nbecome intimidated by the hardserving power game that teams<br />\nlike Cornell favor.<br /><br />\nGoodyear pointed out that real<br />\nsquash \"is not like racquetball<br />\nwhere you try and slam the ball<br />\nindiscriminately around\" but a<br />\ncomplete game, combining finesse,<br />\ntouch, and control. He believes<br />\nthat Hopkins, because they<br />\npossess such skills, can learn to<br />\nredirect the power that their opponents use and make it work to<br />\ntheir advantage. This concept<br />\nwill be important in matches to<br />\ncome, since Hopkins usually<br />\nplays unsophisticated teams that<br />\nemploy hard-serving and overlylarge swings. \"I want to play<br />\nthem [Colgate] again,\" Goodyear<br />\nsaid, believing that the next time,<br />\nHopkins will emerge the winner.<br />\nAlthough the tournament ended on an unhappy note, Hopkins's<br />\nimprovement had been marked.<br />\nA Cornell player approached<br />\nCoach Goodyear after the match<br />\nand remarked that in just two<br />\nweeks since the two teams<br />\nplayed, the Blue Jays are much<br />\ntougher. The Wesleyan Tournament was a good experience for<br />\nHopkins, who usually has an abbreviated fall season of one or<br />\ntwo matches. The tournament,<br />\npossibly to become an annual<br />\nevent, gave the Jays a chance to<br />\nplay competitive squash early on,<br />\nallowed the players to work out<br />\nkinks in their game, and gave the<br />\nteam more momentum towards<br />\nspring semester play.<br />\nThe squash squad now stands<br />\nat 3-4 overall. After Intersession<br />\npractice, the next match will be<br />\naway against Shipley and Division I Franklin and Marshall on<br />\nFriday, January 27.<br /><br />\nIt\u2022 17WITIMITZtrIM 17171717171117V1717176ti<br /><br />\nii11<br />\ni<br />\nPPPI Happy Holidays<br />\nItl<br />\nti<br />\n14<br />\nGITITWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW7*1<br />\nBIA semester finale<br />\nby Cary Yeh<br /><br />\nLazear and Gildersleeve, the top<br />\ntwo seeds, being knocked out.<br />\nMcCoy and Building A met in the<br />\nfinals on Wednesday.

In fact, the entire team did not forecheck well<br />\nat all.<br />\n\"Towson State played the exact type of game we should gave<br />\nplayed,\" said coach Steve Wirth.<br />\n\"These guys [Towson State]<br />\ncame out there wanting this<br />\ngame, and we just handed it to<br />\nthem.

Marquardt<br />\ncontinued his scoring rampage<br />\nwith a hat trick and an assist as<br />\nJay Cawkins scored his first goal<br />\nof the year off Marquardt's rebound.

The Blue<br />\nJays are coming off a very successful 21-1 season last year,<br />\nwhich saw them win their fifth<br />\nconsecutive MAC Championship. The Jays were uncertain as<br />\nto whether they could continue<br />\nthat championship streak this<br />\nyear, as they field five rookies in<br />\na team of nine. But this 2-0 start<br />\ngives the team and its coach,<br />\nRichard Oles, championship<br />\ngoals for the future.<br />\nThe foil team started its season<br />\nwith a bang, as it defeated Purchase by a score of 7-2 and Drew<br />\nby a score of 8-1. The team was<br />\nled by senior co-captain David<br />\n\"Traffic\" Cohen, who was 5-0<br />\non the day. Also leading the way<br />\nwas junior Yen Len \"Party<br />\nAnimal\" Tang, who also finished with a 5-0 mark. Freshman<br />\nRich \"Boo-Boo\" Milhiser obtained his first varsity win and<br />\ndefeat as he ended the day at 1-1.<br />\nSophomores Li Kuo \"Laughing<br />\nBoy\" Kong and Peter \"Sleepy\"<br />\nLiu each had very successful varsity debuts, as they each won a<br />\nbout and ended their day at 1-0.<br />\nThe most mysterious event of<br />\nthe day was when junior Mike<br />\n\"Mad Dog\" Greenfeld was kidnapped by his evil twin prior to<br />\nthe Purchase meet. The twin<br />\nsubstituted for Mike in the Purchase meet and was very disappointing as he lost both his bouts.<br />\nMike was able to free himself<br />\nbefore the Drew meet and uncover the imposter. He redeemed himself for his twin's evildoings to even his record at 2-2.<br />\nThe epee team also started their<br />\nseason on a winning note as they<br />\ndefeated Purchase and Drew by<br />\nthe scores of 6-3 and 5-4, respectively. Defeating Purchase was<br />\nnot easy, as senior co-captain<br />\nRobert \"General\" Lee met with<br />\nthe same fate as foilist Mike<br />\nGreenfield. Lee's evil twin incapacitated him before the meet,<br />\nresulting in a disappointing 1-2<br />\nrecord. Fortunately, Bob freed<br />\nhimself and was a respectable 1-1<br />\nagainst Drew. Sophomores Andrew \"Flash\" Donnalley and Ian<br />\n\"Iron Man\" Held picked up the<br />\nslack as they posted impressive<br />\n5-0 and 4-1 marks respectively on<br />\nthe day. Rookie sophomores Ben<br />\n\"Who Me?\" Lonske, Tim \"Express\" Train, and Dan \"Golden<br />\nBoy\" Weaver allowed the butterflies of their varsity debuts to<br />\novercome them, as each finished<br />\nthe day with a 0-1 mark.<br />\nThe sabre team was also very<br />\nimpressive with a crushing 8-1<br />\nwin over Purchase and a close 5-4<br />\nwin over Drew. Junior cocaptain Andrew \"X-ray\"<br />\nJablonowski had a magnificent<br />\nday, cruising with a 2-0 record<br />\nagainst Purchase until an injury<br /><br />\nHappy 20th<br />\nBirthday,<br />\nColeen!!!<br /><br />\nstruck him down in his first bout<br />\nagainst Drew. Luckily, supersub<br />\nPeter \"Destructo\" Kim was able<br />\nto step in and win the bout for his<br />\nfallen captain. Peter ended his<br />\nday with a fine 3-1 mark. Junior<br />\nDave \"Bubba\" Howe was his<br />\nusual consistent self as he posted<br />\na 4-1 mark. Sophomore John<br />\n\"Rocky\" O'Connell was<br />\nmagnificent in his varsity debut as<br />\nhe posted a record of 4-2 for the<br />\nday. Sophomore Juan \"Valdez\"<br />\nSuros could not capitalize on the<br />\nopportunity of his varsity debut as<br />\nhe ended the day at 0-1.<br />\nThese were the only meets the<br />\nJays had before the Christmas<br />\nbreak, but they will return in<br />\nJanuary for the bulk of their<br />\nseason.
