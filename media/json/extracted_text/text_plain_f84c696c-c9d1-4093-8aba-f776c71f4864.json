The class president can easily become a mere<br />\npawn in the hands of the faction which put him in office.

Though he may owe a certain debt to a limited group, the successful nominee, nevertheless, upon his election, is lifted above party<br />\npolitics. He becomes the leader of a united class and it should be his<br />\nserious duty to fulfill to the best of his ability the obligations which<br />\nhave become his. We believe with Grover Cleveland, \"that public<br />\noffice is a public trust.\" The duties imposed upon a class president are<br />\nbroader than the written requirements of his class constitution. He<br />\nmust be able to successfully pacify rival factions and to secure harmony<br />\nin running the machinery of his class. No wise leader will follow the<br />\nprecepts of the Spoils System in making the oppointments which<br />\ndevolve upon him.
