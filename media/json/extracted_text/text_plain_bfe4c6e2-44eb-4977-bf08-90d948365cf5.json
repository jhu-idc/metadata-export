This year new plants have<br />\nalready been put into operation in<br />\nVirginia and Michigan. Six more<br />\nare under construction. Others are<br />\nplanned for the near future.<br />\nMost DuPont units, it is true, are<br />\nlocated east of the Mississippi. Company headquarters,for example, along<br />\nwith many labs and plants, are located<br />\nin and around Wilmington, Delaware,<br />\nwhich is a pleasant residential area<br />\nwithin easy reach of Washington,<br />\nPhiladelphia and New York.

Members of the<br />\nRadio Club are inclined to believe the physics department<br />\ndoes not have its experiments<br />\nproperly shielded.<br />\nTo decide the exact reason for<br />\nthe interference, a test will be<br />\n<br />\nDSRC Proposal<br />\n<br />\nrun and supervised by Dr. Mandansky of the physics department and Dr. Hamburger, advisor of the Club. If the interference is the fault of the club's<br />\ngear, which is a powerful 1,000<br />\nwatts, they will start looking for<br />\na new location, probably in the<br />\ndorms or some area away from<br />\nthe engineering classrooms.<br />\nAnother solution is, to 'reduce<br />\nthe power, but Dick Chambers,<br />\npresident, expresses the club's<br />\nsentiments on this very positively: \"We don't want to lose<br />\nany of our power. We're proud<br />\nof our 1,000 watts. It is the<br />\nmaximum allowed by law.\"<br />\nEach year the Club competes<br />\n<br />\nin two contests. One is a sweepstake sponsored by the Amateur<br />\nRadio League, covering two<br />\nweekends and 20 radio hours<br />\nduring which they log as manY<br />\namateurs in the U.S. and possessions as possible. Last year<br />\nthey logged every state except<br />\nWyoming. The other is the<br />\n\"DX\", \"distance\" in radio slang,<br />\ncontest which is the same except<br />\nthey try to log as many foreign<br />\ncountries as possible. Last year<br />\nan astounding 84 countries were<br />\nlogged.<br />\nOnce a year the club migrates<br />\nto the seashore for a partY,<br />\notherwise known as the \"Orgy'',<br />\nOf course, being radio bugs, they<br />\ntake their equipment with them,<br />\nHowevbr, most of the club's<br />\nactivities are very informal,<br />\nEach noon hour the members<br />\ncan be found hunched over the<br />\nrig talking to fellow amateurS<br />\nall over the world.

There is no<br />\ncommunity spirit which would engender respect for self,<br />\nothers and University. This is not necessarily regrettable,<br />\nbut is lamentable in this case.<br />\nAdditionally, the common room of the old dormitory<br />\nhas been usurped by the dining room and replaced by<br />\nbarren, cold entry lounges whicfi are seldom used for<br />\ncommunal purposes, whose recreational facilities are limited and vandalized, and which provide no constructive<br />\noutlet for energies which wane destructive when pent up.<br />\nThe best remedy for vandalism, however, lies with<br />\nthe very students who perpetuate the destruction. It is<br />\na platitude of speech, but not of action, that freedom<br />\ndemands a noncommitant responsibility.<br />\nIf the students do not act, the administration has a<br />\nright and duty to imposc unpopular, undesirable, and, in<br />\nsome cases, unneeded restraints.<br />\nA third remedy lies with a major reconstruction of<br />\nthe DSRC. The popular election system naturally seeks<br />\nweak representatives who are reluctant and/or unable<br />\nto govern, and breeds a lack of respect for the Council.<br />\nIt should be replaced by a quasi-elective, quasi-appointive<br />\nsystem which should be centered, where possible, around<br />\nupperclassmen and should operate on an individual House,<br />\nrather than an all-dorm, basis.<br />\nIt is clear that the DSRC is too ineffective to govern<br />\nfour hundred students. The Houses themselves present<br />\nmore suitable units for government because they are<br />\nfamiliar with their residents and peculiar problems, and<br />\nhave their field of jurisdiction reduced to manageable<br />\nsize. While the Houses deal with purely internal problems, the DSRC should handle only policies and problems<br />\ninvolving all Houses and students.<br />\n<br />\npeare, Miss Webster chose to<br />\nillustrate the infinite variety of<br />\nShakespeare's genius and the<br />\ncloseness to us of his characters.<br />\nShakespeare was a man of the<br />\ntheatre who wrote plays to be<br />\nacted. Miss Webster, reading<br />\nboth male and female roles (and<br />\nmost creditably and convincingly,<br />\nmight add) ran the gamut<br />\nfrom dramatic soliloquies to love<br />\nsonnets. These served to mirror<br />\nthe view of the immortal Bard<br />\non such topics as love, honor,<br />\nambition, pathos, comedy and<br />\nevil. Her sources included carefully-chosen scenes from \"Henry<br />\nV\", \"Cyinbelline\", \"Love's Labours Lost\", \"Henry IV\" \"Macbeth\" and \"Antony and Cleopatra\".

Members of the<br />\nRadio Club are inclined to believe the physics department<br />\ndoes not have its experiments<br />\nproperly shielded.<br />\nTo decide the exact reason for<br />\nthe interference, a test will be<br /><br />\nDSRC Proposal<br /><br />\nrun and supervised by Dr. Mandansky of the physics department and Dr. Hamburger, advisor of the Club. If the interference is the fault of the club's<br />\ngear, which is a powerful 1,000<br />\nwatts, they will start looking for<br />\na new location, probably in the<br />\ndorms or some area away from<br />\nthe engineering classrooms.<br />\nAnother solution is, to 'reduce<br />\nthe power, but Dick Chambers,<br />\npresident, expresses the club's<br />\nsentiments on this very positively: \"We don't want to lose<br />\nany of our power. We're proud<br />\nof our 1,000 watts. It is the<br />\nmaximum allowed by law.\"<br />\nEach year the Club competes<br /><br />\nin two contests. One is a sweepstake sponsored by the Amateur<br />\nRadio League, covering two<br />\nweekends and 20 radio hours<br />\nduring which they log as manY<br />\namateurs in the U.S. and possessions as possible. Last year<br />\nthey logged every state except<br />\nWyoming. The other is the<br />\n\"DX\", \"distance\" in radio slang,<br />\ncontest which is the same except<br />\nthey try to log as many foreign<br />\ncountries as possible.

There is no<br />\ncommunity spirit which would engender respect for self,<br />\nothers and University. This is not necessarily regrettable,<br />\nbut is lamentable in this case.<br />\nAdditionally, the common room of the old dormitory<br />\nhas been usurped by the dining room and replaced by<br />\nbarren, cold entry lounges whicfi are seldom used for<br />\ncommunal purposes, whose recreational facilities are limited and vandalized, and which provide no constructive<br />\noutlet for energies which wane destructive when pent up.<br />\nThe best remedy for vandalism, however, lies with<br />\nthe very students who perpetuate the destruction. It is<br />\na platitude of speech, but not of action, that freedom<br />\ndemands a noncommitant responsibility.<br />\nIf the students do not act, the administration has a<br />\nright and duty to imposc unpopular, undesirable, and, in<br />\nsome cases, unneeded restraints.<br />\nA third remedy lies with a major reconstruction of<br />\nthe DSRC. The popular election system naturally seeks<br />\nweak representatives who are reluctant and/or unable<br />\nto govern, and breeds a lack of respect for the Council.<br />\nIt should be replaced by a quasi-elective, quasi-appointive<br />\nsystem which should be centered, where possible, around<br />\nupperclassmen and should operate on an individual House,<br />\nrather than an all-dorm, basis.<br />\nIt is clear that the DSRC is too ineffective to govern<br />\nfour hundred students. The Houses themselves present<br />\nmore suitable units for government because they are<br />\nfamiliar with their residents and peculiar problems, and<br />\nhave their field of jurisdiction reduced to manageable<br />\nsize. While the Houses deal with purely internal problems, the DSRC should handle only policies and problems<br />\ninvolving all Houses and students.<br /><br />\npeare, Miss Webster chose to<br />\nillustrate the infinite variety of<br />\nShakespeare's genius and the<br />\ncloseness to us of his characters.<br />\nShakespeare was a man of the<br />\ntheatre who wrote plays to be<br />\nacted. Miss Webster, reading<br />\nboth male and female roles (and<br />\nmost creditably and convincingly,<br />\nmight add) ran the gamut<br />\nfrom dramatic soliloquies to love<br />\nsonnets. These served to mirror<br />\nthe view of the immortal Bard<br />\non such topics as love, honor,<br />\nambition, pathos, comedy and<br />\nevil. Her sources included carefully-chosen scenes from \"Henry<br />\nV\", \"Cyinbelline\", \"Love's Labours Lost\", \"Henry IV\" \"Macbeth\" and \"Antony and Cleopatra\".
