D., the<br />\nJames Schouler lecturer for 1917,<br />\nbegan a series of lectures on<br />\n\"International Readjustments\" in<br />\nthe Civil Engineering lecture<br />\nroom on Tuesday, April, 6. Mr.<br />\nHill was a schoolmate and close<br />\npersonal friend of the Kaiser, and<br />\nis one of the foremost authorities<br />\non international law.<br />\nDr. Hill was introduced by<br />\nPresident Goodnow to an audience that taxed the capacity of<br />\nthe Civil Engineering hall, with<br />\nall the seats filled and people<br />\nstanding in the rear.<br />\nDr. Hill began his series with<br />\na discussion on \"The Shadow of<br />\nthe Past.\" He traced the development of the historical European<br />\nStates from the fall of the Roman<br />\nEmpire, through to their present<br />\nrelations in war.<br />\nDr. Hill said, in part, that European history was a conflict between humanism and tribalism.<br />\nReligion assumed a unity which it<br />\ndid not possess and, because it<br />\nwas not an actual unity, could not<br />\nsave Europe. He traced the development of powerful national<br />\nmonarchies through the conflict<br />\nbetween the temporal and spiritual powers, through the fall of<br />\nfeudalism, to the stage where nations were military forces ruled<br />\nby an irresponsible sovereignty.<br />\nDr. Hill maintained that a<br />\nState is a moral entity and that<br />\nsovereignty includes the obligation of moral justice to other nations. The unlimited right of any<br />\nnation to make war for any cause<br />\nat all, according to his view, is an<br />\ninheritance from absolutism and<br />\nshould be regulated by international law.<br />\n\"Neutrality,\" Dr. Hill said, \"is<br />\na long step forward from the Machiavellian doctrine of joining at<br />\nthe proper moment with the probable winner to enjoy the fruits of<br />\nvictory.\" \"Nevertheless,\" he went<br />\non, \"neutrality may be highly unmoral.\"<br />\nDr. Hill went on to show the<br />\neconomic relations of nations.<br />\n\"Nations have become the greatest business trusts in the world,\"<br />\nhe said, \"and they view other nations as business rivals.\" After<br />\nshowing that the present relations<br />\nbetween nations is unsocial and<br />\nunethical, Dr. Hill asserted that<br />\ninternational law must extend to<br />\ngovern the rules of peace as well<br />\nas war. \"There is no prospect of<br />\n<br />\nIt is estimated that four hundred citizens of Baltimore and<br />\nvicinity attended the first lecture<br />\nin preparation for the examination for admittance to the Officers' Reserve Corps given by<br />\nLieutenant Elliott in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building on last<br />\nTuesday evening, out of which<br />\nnumber one hundred and fortyfive have definitely declared their<br />\nintentions of pursuing the course<br />\nto the end and have paid the<br />\nregistration fee.<br />\nThis lecture was the first of a<br />\nseries of six which aie to be held<br />\nweekly on Tuesday evenings at S<br />\no'clock-in the hall of the Civil EnAll the<br />\ngineering Building.<br />\nground necessary for an examination for entrance to the Officers'<br />\nReserve Corps is to be covered.<br />\nLieutenant Elliott's last lecture<br />\nwas on the \"Field Service Regulations of the Army.\"<br />\nDuring the latter part of the<br />\npast week Lieutenant Elliott has<br />\nbeen in Washington taking his<br />\nexaminations for a captain's commission. This Tuesday will probably mark the completion of his<br />\nwork at the War Department in<br />\nWashington where the examinations are held. He will then return and resume his duties at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nOn last Friday the last of the<br />\ndrills of the Hopkins corps in the<br />\nFourth Regiment Armory took<br />\nplace and from now on the drill<br />\nhours will be spent on the<br />\ngrounds about the Wyman Mansion and the immediate neighborhood.<br />\nRifles are expected to arrive at<br />\nany time and gun racks are under<br />\nconstruction in the old gymnasium back of the Carroll Mansion.<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council has presented to the Absence Committee<br />\na petition which states that, in<br />\nthe opinion of the council, the<br />\nnew rules in regard to absences<br />\nare over-harsh, and asks that they<br />\nbe in some way modified. The<br />\ncommittee has already announced<br />\nthat, in future, excuses for absence may be handed in writing,<br />\ninStead of being delivered formally, but has made no official<br />\nstatement as to what other steps<br />\nit may be contemplating.<br />\nThe committee believes that in<br />\neliminating the feature of the<br />\nrules which required personal appearance at the committee meetlug before any absence was excused it has eliminated much in<br />\nthem that was objectionable to<br />\nthe undergraduates. Under the<br />\nnew provision all that is necessary is for the student to write<br />\nthe date and reason of his absence, to address the note to the<br />\nAbsence Committee, and to pass<br />\nit into the box outside the registrar's office.<br />\nThe chief feature in the new<br />\nrules to which the Student Council objected, however, was the<br />\nfact that apparently every unexcused absence from class, even<br />\nthough the number be but one or<br />\ntwo, was to count against the<br />\nstudent's grade in that subject.<br />\nIn this connection, the committee drew the attention of the<br />\ncouncil to the exact reading of<br />\nthe rule to which they object.<br />\nThat rule is worded as follows:<br />\n\"Unexcused absences Will count<br />\nagainst the student's grade in the<br />\nsubject concerned.\" No mention<br />\nis made of how much those absences should count \u2014 the rule<br />\nleaves to the discretion of the<br />\ncommittee the fixing of the penalty, and the conditions under<br />\nwhich such a penalty is to be imposed.<br />\nAlthough no official statement<br />\nhas been made by the committee,<br />\nthere are persistent rumors afloat<br />\nto the effect that, if the number of<br />\nunexcused absences under the<br />\nnew rules is small, it is very probable that only unexcused absences<br />\nafter the second will .count<br />\nagainst the term grade.<br />\nIt is also rumored that, al- .<br />\nthough the first two unexcused<br />\nabsences might not be counted,<br />\nthree such absences would take<br />\noff five from the student's term<br />\ngrade.<br />\n<br />\nThe University of California<br />\nhas purchased an indoor golf<br />\nequipment for the purpose of giving a course in golf, which may<br />\nbe substituted for gymnasium<br />\nwork by underclassmen.\u2014Ex.<br />\n<br />\npeace or equity under a system of<br />\nabsolutism.\"<br />\nDr. Hill closed with a denunciation of the system that brought<br />\non the present European war,<br />\nstating that Europe is now reaping the reward of a false conception of statehood.<br />\nThe second of the lectures dealt<br />\nwith \"The Basis for an International Society.\"<br />\nDr. Hill began by sketching the<br />\nforces that governed the masses of<br />\npeople on the earth, and then<br />\noutlined the theories regarding<br />\nGovernments and States as expressed by the two great philosophers Kant and Hegel.

Such. a custom<br />\nis the almost universal \"Cap<br />\nNight,\" when the freshmen of the<br />\ninstitution, gathering about a<br />\nbonfire on time campus, throw into it the headgear which, until<br />\nthat night, had so definitely fixed<br />\ntheir status in the college world.<br />\nThe tradition signifies more than<br />\nthe mere celebration of an obvious fact\u2014Lit represents the ending of the period of probation,<br />\nand the admission of the freshman, with all rights and. privileges, into the fuller phases of the<br />\ncollege life.<br />\nThe period during which the<br />\nheads of the Hopkins freshmen<br />\nmust be adorned by the sign of innocence and- submission expires<br />\nwith the commencement of the<br />\nEaster vacation. This, be it remembered, is time first year in<br />\nwhich the wearing of those caps<br />\nhas been required\u2014it would be<br />\nshame indeed if the freshmen had<br />\nno better sense of the eternal fitness of things than to inaugurate<br />\ntheir freedom from bondage by<br />\ncarelessly stuffing the discarded<br />\n<br />\ncap into a convenient ash can.<br />\nRather should there be a mighty<br />\nblaze on the scar in the landscape<br />\nwhich, one 'day, will be the<br />\nchemical laboratory, with silhouetted figures leaping about it,<br />\n'performing mysterious rites; with<br />\nweird shadows dancing on the<br />\nfacades of the buildings, and<br />\nbarbaric yells rising rhythmically.<br />\nThe custom is not absolutely<br />\nnecessary, of course\u2014the_ welfare<br />\nof the University does not. vitally<br />\ndepend upon the exact manner in<br />\nwhich the freshmen observe the<br />\nending of their period of bondage.<br />\nBut there is already so much<br />\nsmugness in the Homewood air,<br />\nso great a disposal on the part of<br />\nundergraduates to.regulate their<br />\nlives on a strictly utilitarian<br />\nbasis, that the introduction of a<br />\nsymbolic rite into the freshman<br />\nlife can not be regarded as a<br />\nthing wholly undesirable.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Murphy's First Speech.<br />\n<br />\nFrom motives of courtesy alone,<br />\nHopkins students should turn out<br />\nin full force to hear Coach<br />\nMurphy's address this Wednesday.

A man who has accomplished what Mr. Murphy has accomplished in time development of<br />\nthe athletics of a school must be<br />\nendowed with a rather unusual<br />\npersonality, and, undoubtedly,<br />\nshould have quite a number of<br />\ntimings to say.<br />\nWe strongly suspect that Mr.<br />\nMurphy is himself looking forward rather anxiously to this<br />\nWednesday as a means of obtaining some hint as to the nature of<br />\nthe problem which he has to<br />\nsolve. The natural difficulties<br />\nwhich lie in the way of the development of a successful football<br />\npolicy are too great in themselves<br />\nto permit the addition of amiy<br />\nartificial ones. Wednesday's massmeeting would be a highly regrettable occasion if the new<br />\ncoach were to leave it with the impression that time majority of Hopkins men 'were not enough interested to meet the guider of their<br />\nfootball fortunes face to face. \u2022<br />\n<br />\ntions to honorary societies. .

These<br />\nstudents are chosen on the basis<br />\nof their whole collegiate record,<br />\nfrom matriculation to the end of<br />\nthe first semester of senior year.<br />\nConsequently, the time to win the<br />\n\u201eright to wear the coveted gold<br />\nkey, which has for nearly a<br />\ncentury and a half stood for high<br />\nscholarship in the best American<br />\ncolleges, is'now. Freshmen are<br />\nnot always aware that indolence or carelessness now may<br />\nmean the loss of such a distinction when they are seniors.<br />\nThe other gold key, the circle<br />\nof the Omicron Delta Kappa Society, may be won by any upperclassman whose excellence in a<br />\nparticular line of activity, including scholarship, brings him to the<br />\nfavorable notice of time laurelcrowned circle.<br />\nThe society<br />\nelects in May not more than three<br />\nper cent, of time undergraduates<br />\nin the college. Its choice is<br />\nthoroughly impartial, and is<br />\nmade after a very careful inquiry<br />\ninto the fitness of time student to<br />\nreceive the honor.

His<br />\nsubject was the manufacture of<br />\nsteel.<br />\nThe lecture and the pictures<br />\ncovered the whole process, from<br />\nthe mining of the ore to the finished steel rails. Mr. Shannahan<br />\nfirst described the manner Of mining the ore in Cuba, where most<br />\nof the ore for Sparows Point is<br />\nprocured, then traced the ore<br />\nfrom the mines to the ships and<br />\nfrom the ships,to the furnaces at<br />\nSparrows Point. The unloading<br />\nof the ore, the blast furnaces, the<br />\nBessether converter's, the open<br />\nhearth furnaces, and the\u2022 rolling<br />\nmills were all accurately pictured<br />\nand described, and finally \u2014the<br />\nfinished rails were shown as they<br />\nwere loaded on cars for shipment.<br />\nThe pictures showed clearly the<br />\nprocess of manufacturing steel<br />\nand, incidentally, gave an excellent idea of the magnitude of the<br />\nsteel plants at Sparrows Point.<br />\n<br />\n\"NO PEACE WITHOUT JUSTICE\"<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br />\n<br />\ndividual was supreme and the<br />\nGovernment only subordinate to<br />\nthe people, while the other upheld<br />\nthe belief, that the State or Government was an absolute divine<br />\npower.

There can be no international peace as long as there is an<br />\nabsolute divine right among rulers,<br />\nor not until a superior will is<br />\nestablished to counteract this absolute right.

He traced the development of powerful national<br />\nmonarchies through the conflict<br />\nbetween the temporal and spiritual powers, through the fall of<br />\nfeudalism, to the stage where nations were military forces ruled<br />\nby an irresponsible sovereignty.<br />\nDr. Hill maintained that a<br />\nState is a moral entity and that<br />\nsovereignty includes the obligation of moral justice to other nations. The unlimited right of any<br />\nnation to make war for any cause<br />\nat all, according to his view, is an<br />\ninheritance from absolutism and<br />\nshould be regulated by international law.<br />\n\"Neutrality,\" Dr. Hill said, \"is<br />\na long step forward from the Machiavellian doctrine of joining at<br />\nthe proper moment with the probable winner to enjoy the fruits of<br />\nvictory.\" \"Nevertheless,\" he went<br />\non, \"neutrality may be highly unmoral.\"<br />\nDr. Hill went on to show the<br />\neconomic relations of nations.<br />\n\"Nations have become the greatest business trusts in the world,\"<br />\nhe said, \"and they view other nations as business rivals.\" After<br />\nshowing that the present relations<br />\nbetween nations is unsocial and<br />\nunethical, Dr. Hill asserted that<br />\ninternational law must extend to<br />\ngovern the rules of peace as well<br />\nas war. \"There is no prospect of<br /><br />\nIt is estimated that four hundred citizens of Baltimore and<br />\nvicinity attended the first lecture<br />\nin preparation for the examination for admittance to the Officers' Reserve Corps given by<br />\nLieutenant Elliott in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building on last<br />\nTuesday evening, out of which<br />\nnumber one hundred and fortyfive have definitely declared their<br />\nintentions of pursuing the course<br />\nto the end and have paid the<br />\nregistration fee.<br />\nThis lecture was the first of a<br />\nseries of six which aie to be held<br />\nweekly on Tuesday evenings at S<br />\no'clock-in the hall of the Civil EnAll the<br />\ngineering Building.<br />\nground necessary for an examination for entrance to the Officers'<br />\nReserve Corps is to be covered.<br />\nLieutenant Elliott's last lecture<br />\nwas on the \"Field Service Regulations of the Army.\"<br />\nDuring the latter part of the<br />\npast week Lieutenant Elliott has<br />\nbeen in Washington taking his<br />\nexaminations for a captain's commission.

The<br />\ncommittee has already announced<br />\nthat, in future, excuses for absence may be handed in writing,<br />\ninStead of being delivered formally, but has made no official<br />\nstatement as to what other steps<br />\nit may be contemplating.<br />\nThe committee believes that in<br />\neliminating the feature of the<br />\nrules which required personal appearance at the committee meetlug before any absence was excused it has eliminated much in<br />\nthem that was objectionable to<br />\nthe undergraduates. Under the<br />\nnew provision all that is necessary is for the student to write<br />\nthe date and reason of his absence, to address the note to the<br />\nAbsence Committee, and to pass<br />\nit into the box outside the registrar's office.<br />\nThe chief feature in the new<br />\nrules to which the Student Council objected, however, was the<br />\nfact that apparently every unexcused absence from class, even<br />\nthough the number be but one or<br />\ntwo, was to count against the<br />\nstudent's grade in that subject.<br />\nIn this connection, the committee drew the attention of the<br />\ncouncil to the exact reading of<br />\nthe rule to which they object.<br />\nThat rule is worded as follows:<br />\n\"Unexcused absences Will count<br />\nagainst the student's grade in the<br />\nsubject concerned.\" No mention<br />\nis made of how much those absences should count \u2014 the rule<br />\nleaves to the discretion of the<br />\ncommittee the fixing of the penalty, and the conditions under<br />\nwhich such a penalty is to be imposed.<br />\nAlthough no official statement<br />\nhas been made by the committee,<br />\nthere are persistent rumors afloat<br />\nto the effect that, if the number of<br />\nunexcused absences under the<br />\nnew rules is small, it is very probable that only unexcused absences<br />\nafter the second will .count<br />\nagainst the term grade.<br />\nIt is also rumored that, al- .<br />\nthough the first two unexcused<br />\nabsences might not be counted,<br />\nthree such absences would take<br />\noff five from the student's term<br />\ngrade.<br /><br />\nThe University of California<br />\nhas purchased an indoor golf<br />\nequipment for the purpose of giving a course in golf, which may<br />\nbe substituted for gymnasium<br />\nwork by underclassmen.\u2014Ex.<br /><br />\npeace or equity under a system of<br />\nabsolutism.\"<br />\nDr. Hill closed with a denunciation of the system that brought<br />\non the present European war,<br />\nstating that Europe is now reaping the reward of a false conception of statehood.<br />\nThe second of the lectures dealt<br />\nwith \"The Basis for an International Society.\"<br />\nDr. Hill began by sketching the<br />\nforces that governed the masses of<br />\npeople on the earth, and then<br />\noutlined the theories regarding<br />\nGovernments and States as expressed by the two great philosophers Kant and Hegel.

Such. a custom<br />\nis the almost universal \"Cap<br />\nNight,\" when the freshmen of the<br />\ninstitution, gathering about a<br />\nbonfire on time campus, throw into it the headgear which, until<br />\nthat night, had so definitely fixed<br />\ntheir status in the college world.<br />\nThe tradition signifies more than<br />\nthe mere celebration of an obvious fact\u2014Lit represents the ending of the period of probation,<br />\nand the admission of the freshman, with all rights and. privileges, into the fuller phases of the<br />\ncollege life.<br />\nThe period during which the<br />\nheads of the Hopkins freshmen<br />\nmust be adorned by the sign of innocence and- submission expires<br />\nwith the commencement of the<br />\nEaster vacation. This, be it remembered, is time first year in<br />\nwhich the wearing of those caps<br />\nhas been required\u2014it would be<br />\nshame indeed if the freshmen had<br />\nno better sense of the eternal fitness of things than to inaugurate<br />\ntheir freedom from bondage by<br />\ncarelessly stuffing the discarded<br /><br />\ncap into a convenient ash can.<br />\nRather should there be a mighty<br />\nblaze on the scar in the landscape<br />\nwhich, one 'day, will be the<br />\nchemical laboratory, with silhouetted figures leaping about it,<br />\n'performing mysterious rites; with<br />\nweird shadows dancing on the<br />\nfacades of the buildings, and<br />\nbarbaric yells rising rhythmically.<br />\nThe custom is not absolutely<br />\nnecessary, of course\u2014the_ welfare<br />\nof the University does not. vitally<br />\ndepend upon the exact manner in<br />\nwhich the freshmen observe the<br />\nending of their period of bondage.<br />\nBut there is already so much<br />\nsmugness in the Homewood air,<br />\nso great a disposal on the part of<br />\nundergraduates to.regulate their<br />\nlives on a strictly utilitarian<br />\nbasis, that the introduction of a<br />\nsymbolic rite into the freshman<br />\nlife can not be regarded as a<br />\nthing wholly undesirable.<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nMr. Murphy's First Speech.<br /><br />\nFrom motives of courtesy alone,<br />\nHopkins students should turn out<br />\nin full force to hear Coach<br />\nMurphy's address this Wednesday. It will be the new coach's<br />\nfirst official appearance before<br />\nthe University, and, as a matter<br />\nof common hospitality, if for no<br />\nother reason, the assembly hall of<br />\nthe Civil Engineering Building<br />\nshould be packed to the-doors.<br />\nUnless reports have been entirely Misleading, however, Mr.<br />\nMurphy's address should be able<br />\nto stand strictly upon. its own<br />\nmerits. A man who has accomplished what Mr. Murphy has accomplished in time development of<br />\nthe athletics of a school must be<br />\nendowed with a rather unusual<br />\npersonality, and, undoubtedly,<br />\nshould have quite a number of<br />\ntimings to say.<br />\nWe strongly suspect that Mr.<br />\nMurphy is himself looking forward rather anxiously to this<br />\nWednesday as a means of obtaining some hint as to the nature of<br />\nthe problem which he has to<br />\nsolve. The natural difficulties<br />\nwhich lie in the way of the development of a successful football<br />\npolicy are too great in themselves<br />\nto permit the addition of amiy<br />\nartificial ones. Wednesday's massmeeting would be a highly regrettable occasion if the new<br />\ncoach were to leave it with the impression that time majority of Hopkins men 'were not enough interested to meet the guider of their<br />\nfootball fortunes face to face. \u2022<br /><br />\ntions to honorary societies. . The<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa, most venerable<br />\nof all such organizations, elects<br />\nduring March a small group of<br />\ncandidates for the A.

His<br />\nsubject was the manufacture of<br />\nsteel.<br />\nThe lecture and the pictures<br />\ncovered the whole process, from<br />\nthe mining of the ore to the finished steel rails. Mr. Shannahan<br />\nfirst described the manner Of mining the ore in Cuba, where most<br />\nof the ore for Sparows Point is<br />\nprocured, then traced the ore<br />\nfrom the mines to the ships and<br />\nfrom the ships,to the furnaces at<br />\nSparrows Point. The unloading<br />\nof the ore, the blast furnaces, the<br />\nBessether converter's, the open<br />\nhearth furnaces, and the\u2022 rolling<br />\nmills were all accurately pictured<br />\nand described, and finally \u2014the<br />\nfinished rails were shown as they<br />\nwere loaded on cars for shipment.<br />\nThe pictures showed clearly the<br />\nprocess of manufacturing steel<br />\nand, incidentally, gave an excellent idea of the magnitude of the<br />\nsteel plants at Sparrows Point.<br /><br />\n\"NO PEACE WITHOUT JUSTICE\"<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br /><br />\ndividual was supreme and the<br />\nGovernment only subordinate to<br />\nthe people, while the other upheld<br />\nthe belief, that the State or Government was an absolute divine<br />\npower.

There can be no international peace as long as there is an<br />\nabsolute divine right among rulers,<br />\nor not until a superior will is<br />\nestablished to counteract this absolute right.

It is wanted only when it<br />\naccompanies right and justice.<br />\nDr. Hill gave it as his opinion<br />\nthat after this war Europe would<br />\nbe readjusted and redeemed, and<br />\nthat reason and justice and right<br />\nwould prevail in the new Europe.<br />\nThe next lecture will be on<br />\nTuesday, March 13, and will be<br />\non the subject of \"The Pretensions<br />\nof Neo-Imperialism.\"<br /><br />\n`*orirtg\"<br />\nTgratth<br />\nTintly,s<br />\nnrinllirani Clothes<br /><br />\n'Ii'<br /><br />\nname with a<br />\nworld of meaning<br />\nto college men.<br /><br />\nflub<br />\nBALTIMORE, CHARLES AND FAYETTE<br /><br />\nWHEN YOU THINK OF<br /><br />\nDictating Machines<br /><br />\nB.
