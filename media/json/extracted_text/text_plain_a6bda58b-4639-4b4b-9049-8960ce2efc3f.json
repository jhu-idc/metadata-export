From this<br />\npoint buses conveyed the men to<br />\nWaynesboro, where they passed the<br />\nnight.<br />\nOn the morning of the second<br />\nday, the party made the trip to the<br />\nsummit of Pen-Mar.

The bathing<br />\npool at the Springs had been especially prepared, and the men celebrated their arrival by a luxurious<br />\nswim.<br />\nThe next day was devoted to<br />\nfossil hunting and to more detailed<br />\nstudy of the rocks of Western<br />\nMaryland. At 12 o'clock, the expedition took the train to Cumberland, arriving at the hotel in time<br />\nfor lunch.

It has<br />\nnot been the custom to prolong the<br />\ntime during which the clubs are<br />\nactive later than the first of April,<br />\nbut tempting engagements such as<br />\nthe one to be fulfilled Tuesday<br />\nnight have made it worth while<br />\nfor the board of managers to hold<br />\nthe men together for an extra<br />\nperiod of time, and results at the<br />\nlater concerts have shown the extension to be worth while.<br />\nBeyond the limits of the two<br />\nhours in which the clubs present<br />\ntheir work to the Johns Hopkins<br />\npublic at the McCoy Hall concert,<br />\nmembers of the University have<br />\nlittle opportunity to observe the<br />\npart, the musicians play in representing their alma mater. The audience to which the clubs play is<br />\ndifferent with each concert, and in<br />\nthe case of most of the town concerts is assembled through a desire<br />\nto hear whatever musical entertainment the men have prepared rather<br />\nthan through -an interest in Johns<br />\nHopkins student activity. In other<br />\n<br />\nwords, the clubs have no \"following\" such as that\u2022 which appears<br />\nregularly at Homewood to witness<br />\nthe athletic teams in action, and<br />\nreal interest in their work is confined almost solely to those who are<br />\nactually taking part in it, or those<br />\nwho have done so in past years.<br />\nThis is in large part due to the<br />\nnature of the clubs' work, and cannot justly be called an unhealthy<br />\nstate of affairs.<br />\nHowever, it does rob the clubs<br />\nas a whole, as well as the individual<br />\nmembers, of a large part of the<br />\ncredit due them for their sincere<br />\nwork of representing the University. The impression created by the<br />\nmusicians is equally as influential<br />\nin its sphere as is that of any other<br />\nmajor activity, and those men who<br />\nare persevering enough to gain positions on the clubs should receive<br />\na greater share:of honor for their<br />\nattainment ,than that ordinarily accredited thelti.<br />\nThe clubs of this year have done<br />\ntheir part, and THE .NEWSLETTER<br />\n.is very. happy to cOngratulate them<br />\n'on their achievements,. and to wish<br />\nthem .greater success in their next<br />\nseason. It is a, regrettable fact that<br />\nthe nature of their work does not<br />\nseem to favor the bringing forth of<br />\nparticular sentiment from students<br />\nunless that sentiment is founded on<br />\nunfavorable conditions, and we feel<br />\nthat if the attention of more Hopkins men is drawn to that fact,<br />\nthere May be a much desired<br />\nchange of attitude on the part of<br />\nmany who allow the 'years of their<br />\nconnection with the University to,<br />\npass without giving the Musical<br />\nClubs a thought. And if that attention should result in bringing to<br />\nlight any further means of active<br />\nsupport for the clubs, a well defined<br />\nstep towards better conditions will<br />\nhave been taken.<br />\n<br />\nThe Triangular Debate.<br />\n<br />\nThe victory of the 'Varsity debating teams last Saturday night<br />\nis doubly significant. It is significant in that, in itself, it was a distinct achievement-to defeat such<br />\nable teams as those sent out by<br />\nthe Universities of North Carolina<br />\nand Virginia requires debaters extraordinarily well trained and well<br />\nprepared; but its true significance,<br />\nits greatest bearing upon this University's record and reputation, lies<br />\nin the fact that it was the third<br />\nconsecutive victory of its kind, that<br />\nit makes this the third year in<br />\nwhich Johns Hopkins has been the<br />\nwinner of the triangular debafe.<br />\n<br />\nFame may. come to a university<br />\nin two ways.

In Hopkins' half of the ninth,<br />\nwith a man on first and two down,<br />\nHollingsworth hit to deep rightcenter, scoring Sebold with the<br />\nwinning run.<br />\nThe hitting was hard on both<br />\nsides, there being many extra base<br />\nwallops. But Hopkins would never<br />\nruns had not the<br />\nhave scored<br />\nYale pitchers been wild. The four<br />\nused in the game gave 14 Ipsqs on<br />\nballs, eight coming in the second<br />\nperiod, which, mixed with a couple<br />\nof hits and a sacrifice fly, netted<br />\nthe 'Varsity six runs.<br />\nDefandorf grew unsteady as the<br />\ngame progressed, and was finally<br />\nrelieved by Hollingsworth, who<br />\npitched very good ball, overcoming<br />\nseveral displays of poor support.<br />\n.The shift of Captain \"Babe\" Ewing to third proved very successful.<br />\nHis work at the \"hot corner\" and<br />\nthe general playing of \"Pete\" Porter and Noble were the features of<br />\nthe contest.

Thanks to the protection of a<br />\nrather varied collection of raincoats,<br />\nponchos, and sweaters, the results<br />\nachieved during the first part of<br />\nthe trip were practically as good as<br />\nthose of the latter three days, in<br />\nwhich better weather was encountered.<br />\nWork was begun on Monday<br />\nafternoon, after a train ride of two<br />\nhours.

From this<br />\npoint buses conveyed the men to<br />\nWaynesboro, where they passed the<br />\nnight.<br />\nOn the morning of the second<br />\nday, the party made the trip to the<br />\nsummit of Pen-Mar. The view was<br />\nobscured by the mists and rain, but<br />\nenough could be seen to satisfy the<br />\npurposes of the excursion. After<br />\nlunch\u2014eaten around a welcome<br />\nstove in a little cross-roads store\u2014<br />\nthe party traveled to Hancock,<br />\nWest Virginia, and from there took<br />\nbuses to Berkeley Springs. On the<br />\nroad, a stop was made at a quarry,<br />\nat which many rare and beautiful<br />\nfossils were collected. The bathing<br />\npool at the Springs had been especially prepared, and the men celebrated their arrival by a luxurious<br />\nswim.<br />\nThe next day was devoted to<br />\nfossil hunting and to more detailed<br />\nstudy of the rocks of Western<br />\nMaryland. At 12 o'clock, the expedition took the train to Cumberland, arriving at the hotel in time<br />\nfor lunch.

It has<br />\nnot been the custom to prolong the<br />\ntime during which the clubs are<br />\nactive later than the first of April,<br />\nbut tempting engagements such as<br />\nthe one to be fulfilled Tuesday<br />\nnight have made it worth while<br />\nfor the board of managers to hold<br />\nthe men together for an extra<br />\nperiod of time, and results at the<br />\nlater concerts have shown the extension to be worth while.<br />\nBeyond the limits of the two<br />\nhours in which the clubs present<br />\ntheir work to the Johns Hopkins<br />\npublic at the McCoy Hall concert,<br />\nmembers of the University have<br />\nlittle opportunity to observe the<br />\npart, the musicians play in representing their alma mater. The audience to which the clubs play is<br />\ndifferent with each concert, and in<br />\nthe case of most of the town concerts is assembled through a desire<br />\nto hear whatever musical entertainment the men have prepared rather<br />\nthan through -an interest in Johns<br />\nHopkins student activity. In other<br /><br />\nwords, the clubs have no \"following\" such as that\u2022 which appears<br />\nregularly at Homewood to witness<br />\nthe athletic teams in action, and<br />\nreal interest in their work is confined almost solely to those who are<br />\nactually taking part in it, or those<br />\nwho have done so in past years.<br />\nThis is in large part due to the<br />\nnature of the clubs' work, and cannot justly be called an unhealthy<br />\nstate of affairs.<br />\nHowever, it does rob the clubs<br />\nas a whole, as well as the individual<br />\nmembers, of a large part of the<br />\ncredit due them for their sincere<br />\nwork of representing the University. The impression created by the<br />\nmusicians is equally as influential<br />\nin its sphere as is that of any other<br />\nmajor activity, and those men who<br />\nare persevering enough to gain positions on the clubs should receive<br />\na greater share:of honor for their<br />\nattainment ,than that ordinarily accredited thelti.<br />\nThe clubs of this year have done<br />\ntheir part, and THE .NEWSLETTER<br />\n.is very. happy to cOngratulate them<br />\n'on their achievements,. and to wish<br />\nthem .greater success in their next<br />\nseason. It is a, regrettable fact that<br />\nthe nature of their work does not<br />\nseem to favor the bringing forth of<br />\nparticular sentiment from students<br />\nunless that sentiment is founded on<br />\nunfavorable conditions, and we feel<br />\nthat if the attention of more Hopkins men is drawn to that fact,<br />\nthere May be a much desired<br />\nchange of attitude on the part of<br />\nmany who allow the 'years of their<br />\nconnection with the University to,<br />\npass without giving the Musical<br />\nClubs a thought. And if that attention should result in bringing to<br />\nlight any further means of active<br />\nsupport for the clubs, a well defined<br />\nstep towards better conditions will<br />\nhave been taken.<br /><br />\nThe Triangular Debate.<br /><br />\nThe victory of the 'Varsity debating teams last Saturday night<br />\nis doubly significant. It is significant in that, in itself, it was a distinct achievement-to defeat such<br />\nable teams as those sent out by<br />\nthe Universities of North Carolina<br />\nand Virginia requires debaters extraordinarily well trained and well<br />\nprepared; but its true significance,<br />\nits greatest bearing upon this University's record and reputation, lies<br />\nin the fact that it was the third<br />\nconsecutive victory of its kind, that<br />\nit makes this the third year in<br />\nwhich Johns Hopkins has been the<br />\nwinner of the triangular debafe.<br /><br />\nFame may. come to a university<br />\nin two ways.

In Hopkins' half of the ninth,<br />\nwith a man on first and two down,<br />\nHollingsworth hit to deep rightcenter, scoring Sebold with the<br />\nwinning run.<br />\nThe hitting was hard on both<br />\nsides, there being many extra base<br />\nwallops. But Hopkins would never<br />\nruns had not the<br />\nhave scored<br />\nYale pitchers been wild. The four<br />\nused in the game gave 14 Ipsqs on<br />\nballs, eight coming in the second<br />\nperiod, which, mixed with a couple<br />\nof hits and a sacrifice fly, netted<br />\nthe 'Varsity six runs.<br />\nDefandorf grew unsteady as the<br />\ngame progressed, and was finally<br />\nrelieved by Hollingsworth, who<br />\npitched very good ball, overcoming<br />\nseveral displays of poor support.<br />\n.The shift of Captain \"Babe\" Ewing to third proved very successful.<br />\nHis work at the \"hot corner\" and<br />\nthe general playing of \"Pete\" Porter and Noble were the features of<br />\nthe contest.
