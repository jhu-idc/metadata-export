He contrasted the enthusiasm displayed by students of the University of California at their bi-weekly assemblies,<br />\nwith the apathy exhibited by us at<br />\nour own student gatherings. Although the News-Letter does not<br />\nagree with Dr. Chinard when he<br />\nsays that this lack of interest is entirely the fault of the students<br />\nthemselves, it does admit that there<br />\nare good grounds for his statement.<br />\nWe have not supported .the assemblies the way we should; and<br />\nthe worst of it is that it is very<br />\nlargely the men who are leaders in<br />\n<br />\nundergraduate life and men, above<br />\nall others, should be interested who<br />\nare most often absent. The whole<br />\npurpose of the assemblies was to<br />\nbuild up and foster college spirit.<br />\nIf the leaders of the students are<br />\nabsent.it is impossible for the assemblies to gain their objective.<br />\nIt is true that as run this year<br />\nthey have afforded little opportunity for the development of college spirit. Almost every hour has<br />\nbeen practically filled by lectures<br />\nof varying degree of interest. Upon<br />\na few occasions, of which the<br />\nAdams Debate and Toqueville Contest are notable examples\u2014the students have had the hour to themselves, but in the majority of instances the student announcements<br />\nhave had to take the form of hurried, ill-prepared extempories. We<br />\nhave had some exceedingly interesting lectures, but, after all, the<br />\nchief object in having an assembly<br />\nat all has been lost.<br />\nIt is obvious that this state of affairs must be altered next year and<br />\nto that end we suggest that some<br />\ndistinctive order of procedure be<br />\nadopted. Would it not be well to<br />\nhave these gatherings under the<br />\njoint supervision of the-Dean and<br />\nStudent Council, and let them arrange some program which would<br />\nbe of interest to the students and<br />\nyet allow at least fifteen minutes<br />\nfor student announcements, which<br />\ncould then take the form of prepared addresses? We feel sure that<br />\nthe Musical and Dramatic Clubs<br />\nwould be glad to co-operate in providing entertainment. Occasional<br />\naddresses from prominent men on<br />\ntopics of general interest outside<br />\nof the curriculum could be worked<br />\nin and time spent in the development of cheering and singing ability.<br />\nWould it not be a good thing for<br />\nOmicron Delta Kappa and the Student Council to investigate and suggest some means to make the student assemblies in the future more<br />\ntruly a student gathering than they<br />\nhave been in the past?<br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nlowed by an informal (lance, which<br />\nwas much enjoyed by all.

The best that could<br />\nbe done was a co npromise arrangement that was not particularly unsatisfactory to any one chapter. The<br />\nagreement as finally adopted and<br />\nsigned .by the delegates is as follows: \"The rushing season for 1921<br />\nshall begin on October 31, one-half<br />\nan hour before the first class at the<br />\nuniversity. From midnight of October 30th until the beginning of the<br />\nseason there shall be no communication between any fraternity man<br />\nand any man in his first year of<br />\nresidence at Johns Hopkins. The<br />\npurpose of inserting the period of<br />\nsilence clause is to prevent entering<br />\na freshman's house at an early hour<br />\nin the morning and remaining with<br />\nhim until the beginning of the season which made it possible to discuss fraternity matters.<br />\nAfteh the drawing up the rushing agreement which completes the<br />\nwork of the old interfraternity<br />\nboard the officers for the coming<br />\nyear were elected.

He contrasted the enthusiasm displayed by students of the University of California at their bi-weekly assemblies,<br />\nwith the apathy exhibited by us at<br />\nour own student gatherings. Although the News-Letter does not<br />\nagree with Dr. Chinard when he<br />\nsays that this lack of interest is entirely the fault of the students<br />\nthemselves, it does admit that there<br />\nare good grounds for his statement.<br />\nWe have not supported .the assemblies the way we should; and<br />\nthe worst of it is that it is very<br />\nlargely the men who are leaders in<br /><br />\nundergraduate life and men, above<br />\nall others, should be interested who<br />\nare most often absent. The whole<br />\npurpose of the assemblies was to<br />\nbuild up and foster college spirit.<br />\nIf the leaders of the students are<br />\nabsent.it is impossible for the assemblies to gain their objective.<br />\nIt is true that as run this year<br />\nthey have afforded little opportunity for the development of college spirit. Almost every hour has<br />\nbeen practically filled by lectures<br />\nof varying degree of interest. Upon<br />\na few occasions, of which the<br />\nAdams Debate and Toqueville Contest are notable examples\u2014the students have had the hour to themselves, but in the majority of instances the student announcements<br />\nhave had to take the form of hurried, ill-prepared extempories. We<br />\nhave had some exceedingly interesting lectures, but, after all, the<br />\nchief object in having an assembly<br />\nat all has been lost.<br />\nIt is obvious that this state of affairs must be altered next year and<br />\nto that end we suggest that some<br />\ndistinctive order of procedure be<br />\nadopted. Would it not be well to<br />\nhave these gatherings under the<br />\njoint supervision of the-Dean and<br />\nStudent Council, and let them arrange some program which would<br />\nbe of interest to the students and<br />\nyet allow at least fifteen minutes<br />\nfor student announcements, which<br />\ncould then take the form of prepared addresses? We feel sure that<br />\nthe Musical and Dramatic Clubs<br />\nwould be glad to co-operate in providing entertainment. Occasional<br />\naddresses from prominent men on<br />\ntopics of general interest outside<br />\nof the curriculum could be worked<br />\nin and time spent in the development of cheering and singing ability.<br />\nWould it not be a good thing for<br />\nOmicron Delta Kappa and the Student Council to investigate and suggest some means to make the student assemblies in the future more<br />\ntruly a student gathering than they<br />\nhave been in the past?<br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 2)<br /><br />\nlowed by an informal (lance, which<br />\nwas much enjoyed by all.

The best that could<br />\nbe done was a co npromise arrangement that was not particularly unsatisfactory to any one chapter.
