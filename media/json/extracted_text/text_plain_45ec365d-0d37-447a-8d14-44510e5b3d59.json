That is an<br />\nextraordinary number.\"<br />\nYard further contended that,<br />\ncontrary to the claims of the prolife movment, most abortions occur in the first trimester of<br />\npregnancy. \"Ninety percent of all<br />\nabortions take place in the first<br />\ntrimester,\" she claimed, adding<br />\nthat most of the second-trimester<br />\nabortions occur because the<br />\nmother had to wait until sixteen<br />\n<br />\nweeks into the pregnancy before<br />\nshe could undergo amniocentesis.<br />\nMost of these abortions involve<br />\nolder women who are concerned<br />\nthat their child might inherit a<br />\ngenetic disease, will be retarded,<br />\nor will have birth defects. Yard<br />\ncountered the claim that abortion<br />\nis used as a form of birth control<br />\nby saying that \"about one quarter<br />\nof one percent of women have second abortions.\"<br />\nAsked later about specific<br />\nNOW strategies for achieving its<br />\nlegislative goals, Yard said that<br />\n<br />\nEric Deutsch<br />\n<br />\nMolly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women<br />\n<br />\nNOW must ensure the election of<br />\nmore women to positions at all<br />\nlevels of the legislative process.<br />\nShe also said that NOW sponsors<br />\ncandidates that meet the NOW<br />\ncriteria for supporting women's<br />\nrights, regardless of their sex or<br />\nrace.<br />\nNoting that in Congress, antiabortion representatives are often<br />\nassigned to draft bills addressing<br />\nwomen's rights and issues, Yard<br />\nsaid that the only way to assure<br />\nthe passage of women's rights<br />\nbills was to have more women<br />\ndirectly involved in the lawmaking process. Yard said the<br />\ngroup that most often voted<br />\nagainst women's rights bill was<br />\nwhite males.

As her friends and family<br />\nmourn their loss, the shocked community is struck by the senselessness of the<br />\ncrime. That the life of one with so much<br />\nto offer the world should be ended so<br />\nbrutally is an incomprehensible, terrible waste.<br />\nPhillips' death is the more unsettling<br />\nbecause it brings into mind our own<br />\nmortality. She was living a life very<br />\nsimilar to many of our own lives. She<br />\nwas, after all, a student, living in<br />\nCharles Village, a neighborhood heavily<br />\npopulated with Hopkins students. While<br />\nwe do not know the full circumstances<br />\nof her death, it appears that such an unprovoked assault could have happened<br />\nto any one of us.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that it has taken this<br />\ntragedy to forcibly turn students' attention to the issue of security. While it<br />\nmay seem shocking to us that such a<br />\ntragedy could occur among us, to the<br />\n-Baltimore City Police, Phillips' death is<br />\nbut a homicide statistic on a list in a<br />\nlarge metropolitan area. Crimes such-as<br />\nthis are commonplace in this and many<br />\nother cities.<br />\nFor our campus is, in fact, despite its<br />\ngrassy fields and stately Georgian architecture, in a large and dangerous city. We naively view Homewood as<br />\nsomehow separate from Baltimore, and<br />\n<br />\ntend to view ourselves as separate from<br />\nthe dangers of living here. As students<br />\nliving off-campus, we see our<br />\nneighborhoods as extensions of that<br />\nidyllic haven, rather than the urban<br />\nareas that they are. This assumption<br />\noften leads to careless and reckless<br />\nbehavior on our parts.

He points out that they<br />\nare quite up front about being. . . well. . . Republicans: I<br />\nmean, gosh, they call themselves<br />\nRepublicans and everything. True<br />\nenough, but not quite to the point.<br />\nWhat do I mean by disingenuous<br />\nin the case of CR's? I mean that<br />\nthey are involved in political<br />\nstruggles, but they try to act as if<br />\nthey are doing something else.<br />\nThis is particularly a question of<br />\nhow they present themselves.<br />\nYes, they call themselves<br />\nRepublicans, but somehow they<br />\nnever talk about themselves as if<br />\nthey were involed for political<br />\nreasons. You'd almost think CR's<br />\nstood for College Religionists<br />\nthey way they've been wading into theological questions of late.<br />\nFirst they set themselves up as<br />\nauthorities on what counts as<br />\nreligious, and then they attack the<br />\nChaplain for involving herself in<br />\nnonreligious activities. Ask the<br />\nCR's why they're gunning for<br />\nthe Chaplain and what do they tell<br />\nyou? They come back with<br />\nsomething about how the<br />\nChaplain should limit herself to<br />\nreligious issues. But is that why<br />\nthey're gunning for the Chaplain?<br />\nNo, that's the argument they're<br />\nusing as a weapon in their attempt<br />\nto silence a voice they oppose for<br />\npolitical reasons. If the CR's<br />\nwere honest they'd admit that<br />\nthey don't give a damn whether<br />\nthe Chaplain's positions are genuinely religious or not. All they<br />\ncare about is that she stop saying<br />\nand doing things that don't cohere<br />\nwith their right-wing ideology.<br />\nBut they won't admit this. Instead<br />\nthey cloak themselves in the mantle of religious purity. And that,<br />\nMr. Rosen, is disingenuous.<br />\nBy the way, I'm with Steve<br />\nJohnston: sign the CR's petition<br />\nbecause we all agree that the<br />\nChaplain should limit herself to<br />\nreligion, but oppose the CR's attempts to dictate what counts as<br />\nreligion.<br />\nNote, Mr. Rosen, I stick to my<br />\nword: I have nothing further to<br />\nsay on the antisemitism issue.<br />\n<br />\nI have been approached several<br />\ntimes in recent weeks by people<br />\nwanting confirmation of a rumor<br />\nthat \"R.E.M. almost played<br />\nhere.\" Since I am responsible for<br />\nthe rumor, I thought it would be<br />\nuseful to present the facts openly<br />\nbefore I leave Hopkinsland.<br />\nIt is true. R.E.M. was interested in playing Hopkins. As<br />\npart of the plan, members of the<br />\nConcert Committee investigated<br />\nthe logistics of holding an outdoor<br />\nconcert on Homewood Field, for<br />\napproximately 10,000 area<br />\nstudents. The list of potential problems is large; however, during<br />\nthis year I feel we reached acceptable answers to the major ones.<br />\nSome of you are no doubt<br />\nwondering about the response<br />\nfrom the administration. I was<br />\nskeptical, but was very pleasantly surprised. The folks at the<br />\nathletic center checked weight requirements for the field and determined that the field could be sufficiently protected. The student<br />\nactivities office showed support<br />\nfor the event. Nobody was jumping for joy at the thought of the<br />\nconcert, but almost everyone did<br />\nseem willing to help as much as<br />\npossible.<br />\nThe list of problems solved<br />\nlooks like this: financing (outside<br />\npromoter), stage placement,<br />\npower supply, crowd control,<br />\nseating arrangements, ticket sales<br />\navenues (college students only),<br />\nbands (several possibilities exist<br />\nfor this size range). The solution<br />\noptions for these problems and<br />\nothers are in a report which will<br />\nbe delivered to Student Council at<br />\nthe end of this semester. The major unsolved problems are: noise.<br />\nCommunity affairs felt the<br />\nnoise would be impossible to sell<br />\nto the community. Perhaps, but<br />\nI would have liked a chance to<br />\ntry. I can hear lacrosse games<br />\nfrom my apartment (30th and<br />\nCalvert).

Divisional autonomy<br />\nallowed the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences to be distressingly poor<br />\nwhile the Medical School was<br />\nvery rich. As in some families,<br />\nthe rich member was not inclined to contribute to a \"bail-out\"<br />\nof the poor cousin. In university<br />\nfinancing (as for personal credit<br />\ncards), there comes a time when<br />\none has to \"pay up.\" That's what<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan is about.<br />\nStudents are paying through increased tuition; the faculty,<br />\nespecially in A&S, are paying<br />\nthrough smaller salary increases<br />\nand larger teaching loads. The<br />\nDivisions of Medicine, Engineering, and the Applied Pysics<br />\nLaboratory are contributing to a<br />\nreserve fund that will bring A&S<br />\nout of debtors' prison.<br />\nFor my part, I like many of the<br />\ndevelopments of the Muller<br />\nyears. The more diverse<br />\nundergraduate student body is a<br />\npleasure to teach; merging<br />\nEngineering with A&S was a<br />\nmistake\u2014the recreated Division<br />\nof Engineering is thriving; the addition of Peabody seems to me an<br />\nexcellent move for a university<br />\nlong on teaching theory but lacking in \"performance\" opportunities for its students, especially the undergraduates.<br />\nPerhaps the new president can<br />\nsolve the problems arising from<br />\ndivisional autonomy without<br />\neroding the special character of<br />\neach division; perhaps the new<br />\npresident will be a wizard fund<br />\nraiser, close friend to students<br />\nand faculty, and a noted scholar;<br />\nperhaps the Orioles will win the<br />\nWorld Series in 1989!<br />\n<br />\nto the March of Dimes<br />\nWalkathon, for example).

The bakery enjoys the<br />\npatronage of 25 or 30 regular<br />\ncustomers, who come in daily to<br />\nbuy croissants.<br />\nAlthough they sell mostly<br />\nbreads and plain croissants, fancy croissants and pastries, and<br />\ncakes for wedding and birthdays<br />\nare also popular.<br />\n\"We sell what we bake.

But<br />\nvery few Hopkins students have<br />\nheard of the Babe Ruth Museum<br />\nright here in Baltimore.<br />\nThe museum, downtown at 216<br />\nEmory Street, is the actual house<br />\nin which Babe Ruth grew up. It<br />\nis actually made up of four<br />\nhouses, from 212 to 218, but part<br />\nof the original Babe Ruth house<br />\nis still preserved just as young<br />\nRuth would have remembered it.<br />\nOn the second floor visitors can<br />\nsee the very room where Babe<br />\nRuth was born on February 6,<br />\n1895. Outside the room are<br />\nvarious photos of the legend<br />\nthroughout the his life, as well as<br />\npersonal mementoes like his suitcase and his team photo when he<br />\nattended St. Mary's Industrial<br />\nSchool. His parents sent him<br />\naway to the reform school when<br />\nhe was only seven years old. It<br />\nwas at the school that he learned<br />\nto play baseball.<br />\nWord of Ruth's talent spread.<br />\nIn 1914 Jack Dunn, owner of the<br />\nminor league Baltimore Oribles,<br />\nsigned Ruth onto the team.<br />\nBecause he was only 18, he was<br />\ncalled Dunn's \"baby,\" or later,<br />\n\"Babe\" Ruth. The museum also<br />\nhas an exhibit on Jack Dunn as<br />\nwell as Jack Dunn II, III, and IV,<br />\nall of whom were and are active<br />\nin Baltimore baseball in various<br />\nroles.<br />\n<br />\nBabe Ruth was traded for<br />\n$3000 to pitch for the Boston Red<br />\nSox. His contract was then sold<br />\nto the New York Yankees in 1920<br />\nfor a phenomenal $125,000.<br />\nYankee Stadium, \"The House<br />\nThat Ruth Built,\" was designed<br />\nto hold the crowds that flocked to<br />\nsee the Babe hit. He set an incredible number of hitting<br />\nrecords before he retired from<br />\nplaying in 1935. In 1936 he was<br />\nelected to the Baseball Hall of<br />\nFame. He died of cancer in 1948.<br />\nThe museum is actually called<br />\nthe Babe Ruth Birthplace and<br />\nBaltimore Orioles Museum<br />\nbecause it contains more than just<br />\nBabe Ruth rememberances.<br />\nThere is a room dedicated to the<br />\nOrioles, filled with memorabilia<br />\nsince 1954, when they entered the<br />\nmajor leagues. There is the 1983<br />\nWorld Series trophy, numerous<br />\nuniforms, equipment, and awards<br />\nof players (including Jim<br />\nPalmer's Cy Young Award), as<br />\nwell as the Orioles Hall of Fame<br />\nwhich includes Brooks Robinson,<br />\nEarl Weaver, Ken Singleton, and<br />\nother Orioles greats.<br />\nA new addition to the museum<br />\nis the brand new Orioles<br />\nuniforms. These uniforms,<br />\nreflecting the first changes in<br />\neight years, have not even been<br />\nworn yet\u2014they will debut on<br />\nopening day.

Who says physics<br />\nisn't exciting?<br />\nA small group of Hopkins<br />\nphysicists have produced the<br />\nheart of one of the detectors of the<br />\nworld's premier particle accelerators. The job, to design and<br />\nbuild the equipment for the Large<br />\nElectron-Positron Collider(LEP)<br />\nwhich is being built in Geneva by<br />\nCERN, fell to Hopkins after a<br />\nlarge team at Northeastern<br />\nUniversity failed to produce a<br />\nworkable design after six years of<br />\ntrying. That was six months ago.<br />\nSince then, Dr. Aihud Pevsner,<br />\nlab director Jack Spangler, postdoc Homera Akbari, grad student<br />\nJian-Zhong Bao, Mechnical<br />\nEngineering professor Dr. Edwin<br />\nFitzgerald, his son Robert<br />\nFitzgerald, engineer Joe Orndorff, technician Dave Newman,<br />\ntwo machine shops, and two<br />\nundergraduates, Dan Durkin and<br />\nChris Kolda, have achieved what<br />\nseemed almost impossible around<br />\nChristmastime: to design and<br />\nconstruct the electronics for the<br />\nTime Expansion Chamber<br />\n(TEC), which will house and<br />\nregister the results of high energy<br />\ncollisions. Says Dr. Walker,<br />\n\"[Their achievement] was<br />\nmiraculous. . .1 didn't think they<br />\n<br />\ncould do it.\"<br />\nCERN,<br />\nthe<br />\nEuropean<br />\nOrganization for Nuclear<br />\nResearch, is an international<br />\nresearch facility in Geneva,<br />\nSwitzerland. Construction of LEP<br />\nbegan about six years ago, with<br />\nthe goal of studying the fundamental particles that make up<br />\nour universe. LEP creates beams<br />\nof fundamental particles, electrons and positrons, magnetically accelerates them around a 27kilometer circular track located<br />\nup to 100 meters underground,<br />\nand lets them collide at four sites<br />\naround the ring. The result of<br />\nthese tremendously high energy<br />\ncollisions is an assortment of particles that are recorded by detectors that encapsulate the collision<br />\nsite. These detectors are capable<br />\nof measuring the charge, mass,<br />\nand energy of the new particles.<br />\nPhysicists will analyze the data<br />\nfrom detectors, searching for<br />\nclues about how the universe is<br />\nheld together.<br />\nHigh-energy physics is the<br />\nstudy of what are believed to be<br />\nthe four fundamental forces of the<br />\nuniverse: the strong force, the<br />\nweak force, the electromagnetic<br />\nforce, and gravity. Experiments<br />\nat CERN have shown that, at high<br />\ntemperatures, where fundamental<br />\nparticles have a lot of energy, the<br />\nelectromagnetic and weak forces<br />\nunify to become the electroweak<br />\nforce. These results have led<br />\nphysicists to speculate that immediately after the Big Bang, the<br />\nexplosion which is believed to<br />\nhave started the universe, the<br />\ntemperature of the universe was<br />\n<br />\nle degrees Kelvin(103'degrees iglass wires\u2014fiber optics\u2014that are<br />\ncelsius plus 273.15 more).

It<br />\nalso can help answer more basic<br />\nquestions about how specific<br />\ngenes act.<br />\nThe research focuses on<br />\nmatagens (Masking Tape for<br />\nGene Expression), segments of<br />\nlab-made genetic material that<br />\nbind to messenger RNA, the first<br />\nmolecule a gene expresses. The<br />\nmatagens' structure so complements the messenger RNA\u2014<br />\nlike a reverse image\u2014that it is effectively blocked. Then all the<br />\nreactions a gene normally triggers<br />\nin a cell, such as formation of enzymes of cell structures, stop.<br />\n<br />\nLEP collider<br />\nPHYSICS, from 16<br />\neffective. Plus, the L3 is being<br />\nbuilt in 13 different countries by<br />\n460 different scientists. Each<br />\npiece is sent to Geneva, where<br />\nthey are all assembled and<br />\nhopefully are compatible with<br />\neach other. The faster the components get to Geneva, the sooner<br />\nthey can be tested, and the more<br />\ntime physicists have to work out<br />\nthe bugs. Consequently, the TEC<br />\nis being rushed to Geneva in<br />\nseparate boxes. The chances for<br />\n<br />\nerror and failure are enormous.<br />\nThe Hopkins team has surprised<br />\nitself by its consistent success.<br />\nLEP will be switched on<br />\nsometime this summer.

Matagens similarly have<br />\nhalted a simian virus, vesicular<br />\nstomatitis virus, in cell cultures<br />\nfrom monkeys and mice, and a<br />\nrabbit gene coding for part of the<br />\nhemoglobin molecule. Experiments are still in their early<br />\nstages, says researcher Paul<br />\nMiller, Ph.D. But human applications should follow, first with<br />\nviruses such as herpes or human<br />\nT-cell leukemia, then with genes<br />\n<br />\nthat regulate cancer genes.<br />\nThe Hopkins matagen appears<br />\nto be unique. Miller says, in overcoming a number of the<br />\nobstacles. Chemists designed it to<br />\nbe similar enough in structure to<br />\ntrue genetic material to bind with<br />\nit, but different enough to resist<br />\nenzyme digestion.

The man was dressed in snakeskin boots, with<br />\nleather pants and trenchcoat.<br />\nSenior Neil Seidman foolishly<br />\nasked him if he was, in fact, Jesse<br />\n\"the Body\" Ventura. The giant,<br />\nwho turned out to be Jake \"the<br />\nSnake\" Menella, grunted back,<br />\n\"Jesse got no hair, fool,\" and<br />\nlooked as if he was going to pinch<br />\n<br />\nNeil's head off and feed it to his<br />\nsnake sidekick Damien.<br />\nOnce in Boston and at the MIT<br />\nrifle range, the team made lastminute preparations for the<br />\nmatch. When the Blue Jays<br />\ndiscovered that they had<br />\nmistakenly brought cheap pistol<br />\nSee RIFLE, 22<br />\n<br />\nMen's tennis remains winless<br />\nby Andy Prior<br />\nWith Tuesday's loss to Catholic<br />\nUniversity, the men's tennis<br />\nteam's record fell to 0-3. The<br />\nJays are a relatively young squad<br />\nthis season, though, and continue<br />\nto improve.<br />\nThe Jays opened their season at<br />\nLoyola on Tuesday, March 14,<br />\nwith a 6-3 loss. Hopkins' Lorin<br />\nEngquist defeated Tony Frontera<br />\nin straight sets, 7-6, 7-0, 6-4, at<br />\nfirst singles, and Francois<br />\nErasmus came back to defeat<br />\nLoyola's Chris Saumell 4-6, 6-3,<br />\n6-4 at sixth singes. Hopkins' Sean<br />\nGraham was narrowly defeated<br />\nby Bart Kelly in fourth singles<br />\nplay, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4).<br />\nOn Friday, March 17, Hopkins<br />\nhosted Drew, dropping that<br />\nmatch 8-1. Graham pulled out a<br />\nwin over Drew's Chip Miller<br />\nwith two narrow tie-breakers,<br />\n3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), saving<br />\nthe Jays from a shutout.<br />\nTuesday's 6-3 loss to Catholic<br />\nUniversity came down to the<br />\nJays' inexperience in the third set<br />\nof three singles matches, according to Coach Bill Nelson.<br />\nHolzman tried to come back with<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION<br />\nALL STUDENTS:<br />\nThe deadline to file your<br />\n1988 tax return is April 15,<br />\n1989.

No appointments are necessary, but we<br />\nsuggest you come early. For<br />\nmore information, call<br />\n338-8032. Anyone who<br />\nwould like to see the tax<br />\nmanager at a time and date<br />\nother than the hours stated<br />\nshould make an appointment<br />\nby calling 338-8442.<br />\n<br />\na second-set tie-breaker, but<br />\nCU's Andy Heckenberger held<br />\non in the third set to take the second singles match, 6-4,<br />\n6-7(8-6), 6-3. Graham jumped<br />\nout in the first set at fourth<br />\nsingles, but a tie-breaker in the<br />\nsecond set allowed Catholic's<br />\nBrian Caughlin to rally in the<br />\nthird set for a 3-6, 7-6(7-5), 6-3<br />\nwin. The Jays' Erasmus could not<br />\nconvert his second-set victory into a match win, dropping at fifth<br />\nsingles to Bill Sallivy, 6-0, 4-6,<br />\n6-4. Engquist defeated CU's<br />\nMichael Rave in straight sets,<br />\n7-5, 6-1, and combined with<br />\nHolzman in first doubles to win<br />\nout over Rave and Brennan in a<br />\npro set, 8-1. Jon Missner and<br />\nGraham defeated Heckenberger<br />\nand Dave Grogan in the second<br />\ndoubles match 8-3 in a pro set.<br />\nAccording to Coach Nelson,<br />\nthe Jays are a young squad, with<br />\njust one senior and no junior<br />\nplayers. Three sophomores and<br />\nfour freshmen complete the<br />\nroster. Despite this inexperience,<br />\nCoach Nelson claims that his<br />\nteam has shown improvement<br />\nsince the Spring Break, pointing<br />\nout the match against Catholic<br />\n<br />\nUniversity as a turning point for<br />\nthe team.<br />\nThis season's squad is led by<br />\nsenior Jon Holzman, who plays<br />\nsecond singles, with sophomore<br />\nLorin Engquist holding the first<br />\nsingles slot. The two combine for<br />\nfirst doubles play. Sophomore<br />\nJon Missner, sophomore Sean<br />\nGraham, freshman Ted Roth, and<br />\nfreshman Francois Erasmus fill<br />\nout the remaining singles slots, in<br />\nthat order. The second and third<br />\ndoubles have been filled variously<br />\nfrom among them.<br />\nEngquist has been the most<br />\nconsistent player, with a personal<br />\nrecord of 2-1, dropping his only<br />\nmatch to Drew. He, Holzman,<br />\nMissner, and Graham are the<br />\nbackbone of the team, says Coach<br />\nNelson. Graham's 1-2 record is<br />\nmisleading because of losses in<br />\nthree-set matches due to tiebreakers.<br />\nThe Jays will play in the<br />\nTowson State Tournament this<br />\nweekend.

After intense bidding<br />\nby several major firms, the project was contracted to Eddie's<br />\nSupercolliders. Sources inside the<br />\nNews-Letter have denied rumors<br />\nthat the Eddie's conglomerate<br />\nthreatened to stop supplying beer<br />\nfor the Quiz if they did not get the<br />\ncontract.<br />\nAsked about the financial situasoon-to-be-late-andtion,<br />\nlamented University President<br />\nSteven Muller said that the time<br />\nwas just right.<br />\nThe financial market is strong<br />\nright now,\" he said. \"Thanks to<br />\nour intensive fund-raising efforts,<br />\nthe chances of forfeiture are slim,<br />\nreally. Besides, for an insolvent<br />\nuniversity division, we got an excellent interest rate.\"<br />\nThe loan was made by the Kentucky Fried Chicken Corpora-<br />\n<br />\ntion, the same company that<br />\nsponsored the \"space chicken\"<br />\nproject in which eggs were allowed to mature in orbit in the space<br />\nshuttle.<br />\nThe second phase of this project calls for the development of<br />\na low-gravity breading product,<br />\nby which the Colonel's extracrispy chicken could be created in<br />\nspace.<br />\nShould the University default<br />\non the loan, however, Kentucky<br />\nFried Chicken can assume ownership of the School. Should this<br />\nhappen, KFC spokesman Lt.<br />\nRhett Butler said students should<br />\nnot be concerned about any major changes.<br />\n\"Of course there'd be some<br />\nchanges in the food service<br />\naround these heya parts,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"Only minor change in the<br />\nacademics. For instance, we do<br />\nwant the philosophy to come up<br />\nwith an answer to that chicken<br />\nand egg question.\"<br />\nOther proposed changes would<br />\nbe a country music department at<br />\nthe Peabody, and a change to the<br />\nUniversity's motto. Under new<br />\nownership it would become,<br />\n\"Y'all donate money back now,<br />\ny'heah?\"<br />\nPhysics Professor Gordon<br />\n<br />\nFeldman insisted that the University needs a particle accelerator to<br />\nstay competitve in the 1990s. He<br />\nsaid that such a device, which<br />\ntakes a few teensy-weensy little<br />\nparticles and smashes them apart<br />\ninto bunches of even smaller<br />\npieces, is necessary for studying<br />\nsubatomic particle physics. It also<br />\ngrinds great coffee, and it is the<br />\n<br />\nbest way known to pull apart<br />\nthings accidentally superglued<br />\ntogether.<br />\nAccording to Muller, the<br />\nchoice of Geneva as the location<br />\nfor the collider had nothing to do<br />\nwith making Hopkins visible in<br />\nthe European community.<br />\n\"I think we own enough of<br />\nBaltimore as it is, so I didn't want<br />\n<br />\nto build it here,\" he said. \"And<br />\nafter a while you get sick of sunny beaches and palm trees, so we<br />\nkept the project away from the<br />\ntropics.

That is an<br />\nextraordinary number.\"<br />\nYard further contended that,<br />\ncontrary to the claims of the prolife movment, most abortions occur in the first trimester of<br />\npregnancy. \"Ninety percent of all<br />\nabortions take place in the first<br />\ntrimester,\" she claimed, adding<br />\nthat most of the second-trimester<br />\nabortions occur because the<br />\nmother had to wait until sixteen<br /><br />\nweeks into the pregnancy before<br />\nshe could undergo amniocentesis.<br />\nMost of these abortions involve<br />\nolder women who are concerned<br />\nthat their child might inherit a<br />\ngenetic disease, will be retarded,<br />\nor will have birth defects.

As her friends and family<br />\nmourn their loss, the shocked community is struck by the senselessness of the<br />\ncrime. That the life of one with so much<br />\nto offer the world should be ended so<br />\nbrutally is an incomprehensible, terrible waste.<br />\nPhillips' death is the more unsettling<br />\nbecause it brings into mind our own<br />\nmortality. She was living a life very<br />\nsimilar to many of our own lives. She<br />\nwas, after all, a student, living in<br />\nCharles Village, a neighborhood heavily<br />\npopulated with Hopkins students. While<br />\nwe do not know the full circumstances<br />\nof her death, it appears that such an unprovoked assault could have happened<br />\nto any one of us.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that it has taken this<br />\ntragedy to forcibly turn students' attention to the issue of security. While it<br />\nmay seem shocking to us that such a<br />\ntragedy could occur among us, to the<br />\n-Baltimore City Police, Phillips' death is<br />\nbut a homicide statistic on a list in a<br />\nlarge metropolitan area. Crimes such-as<br />\nthis are commonplace in this and many<br />\nother cities.<br />\nFor our campus is, in fact, despite its<br />\ngrassy fields and stately Georgian architecture, in a large and dangerous city. We naively view Homewood as<br />\nsomehow separate from Baltimore, and<br /><br />\ntend to view ourselves as separate from<br />\nthe dangers of living here. As students<br />\nliving off-campus, we see our<br />\nneighborhoods as extensions of that<br />\nidyllic haven, rather than the urban<br />\nareas that they are. This assumption<br />\noften leads to careless and reckless<br />\nbehavior on our parts. For instance,<br />\nwalking home drunk from parties, or<br />\neven from visiting friends late at night<br />\nis quite common. Necessary precautions<br />\nare rarely taken. If any good is to come<br />\nfrom the catastrophic tragedy of last<br />\nweek, students must alter this perception of the city as an extension of campus, and open their eyes to dangerous<br />\nrealities of urban life.<br />\nFurthermore, students cease to<br />\nperceive campus as safe from city<br />\ncrime. Incidences that have happened in<br />\nthe past semester point to the fact that<br />\nHomewood is just as susceptible te<br />\nviolence\u2014maybe even more susceptible, given our naivete and foolhardy<br />\nbehavior.<br />\nIt would not be fair, however, to warn<br />\nonly students. Homewood administration must, once and for all, admit the<br />\ninadequacies of Campus Security\u2014<br />\nespecially because of these recent<br />\nincidences\u2014 and act swiftly to rectify<br />\nthem.

All are at the camp free<br />\nof charge, having been recommended by social workers in their<br />\nhome neighborhoods in New<br />\nYork. Most come to the camp<br />\nfrom one parent homes, and<br />\nmany have hair-raising stories to<br />\ntell of shootings and the like in<br />\ntheir housing complexes. A<br />\nsignificant few come from stable,<br />\nworking poor households.

He points out that they<br />\nare quite up front about being. . . well. . . Republicans: I<br />\nmean, gosh, they call themselves<br />\nRepublicans and everything. True<br />\nenough, but not quite to the point.<br />\nWhat do I mean by disingenuous<br />\nin the case of CR's? I mean that<br />\nthey are involved in political<br />\nstruggles, but they try to act as if<br />\nthey are doing something else.<br />\nThis is particularly a question of<br />\nhow they present themselves.<br />\nYes, they call themselves<br />\nRepublicans, but somehow they<br />\nnever talk about themselves as if<br />\nthey were involed for political<br />\nreasons. You'd almost think CR's<br />\nstood for College Religionists<br />\nthey way they've been wading into theological questions of late.<br />\nFirst they set themselves up as<br />\nauthorities on what counts as<br />\nreligious, and then they attack the<br />\nChaplain for involving herself in<br />\nnonreligious activities. Ask the<br />\nCR's why they're gunning for<br />\nthe Chaplain and what do they tell<br />\nyou? They come back with<br />\nsomething about how the<br />\nChaplain should limit herself to<br />\nreligious issues. But is that why<br />\nthey're gunning for the Chaplain?<br />\nNo, that's the argument they're<br />\nusing as a weapon in their attempt<br />\nto silence a voice they oppose for<br />\npolitical reasons. If the CR's<br />\nwere honest they'd admit that<br />\nthey don't give a damn whether<br />\nthe Chaplain's positions are genuinely religious or not. All they<br />\ncare about is that she stop saying<br />\nand doing things that don't cohere<br />\nwith their right-wing ideology.<br />\nBut they won't admit this. Instead<br />\nthey cloak themselves in the mantle of religious purity. And that,<br />\nMr. Rosen, is disingenuous.<br />\nBy the way, I'm with Steve<br />\nJohnston: sign the CR's petition<br />\nbecause we all agree that the<br />\nChaplain should limit herself to<br />\nreligion, but oppose the CR's attempts to dictate what counts as<br />\nreligion.<br />\nNote, Mr. Rosen, I stick to my<br />\nword: I have nothing further to<br />\nsay on the antisemitism issue.<br /><br />\nI have been approached several<br />\ntimes in recent weeks by people<br />\nwanting confirmation of a rumor<br />\nthat \"R.E.M. almost played<br />\nhere.\" Since I am responsible for<br />\nthe rumor, I thought it would be<br />\nuseful to present the facts openly<br />\nbefore I leave Hopkinsland.<br />\nIt is true. R.E.M. was interested in playing Hopkins. As<br />\npart of the plan, members of the<br />\nConcert Committee investigated<br />\nthe logistics of holding an outdoor<br />\nconcert on Homewood Field, for<br />\napproximately 10,000 area<br />\nstudents. The list of potential problems is large; however, during<br />\nthis year I feel we reached acceptable answers to the major ones.<br />\nSome of you are no doubt<br />\nwondering about the response<br />\nfrom the administration. I was<br />\nskeptical, but was very pleasantly surprised. The folks at the<br />\nathletic center checked weight requirements for the field and determined that the field could be sufficiently protected. The student<br />\nactivities office showed support<br />\nfor the event. Nobody was jumping for joy at the thought of the<br />\nconcert, but almost everyone did<br />\nseem willing to help as much as<br />\npossible.<br />\nThe list of problems solved<br />\nlooks like this: financing (outside<br />\npromoter), stage placement,<br />\npower supply, crowd control,<br />\nseating arrangements, ticket sales<br />\navenues (college students only),<br />\nbands (several possibilities exist<br />\nfor this size range). The solution<br />\noptions for these problems and<br />\nothers are in a report which will<br />\nbe delivered to Student Council at<br />\nthe end of this semester. The major unsolved problems are: noise.<br />\nCommunity affairs felt the<br />\nnoise would be impossible to sell<br />\nto the community. Perhaps, but<br />\nI would have liked a chance to<br />\ntry. I can hear lacrosse games<br />\nfrom my apartment (30th and<br />\nCalvert).

Divisional autonomy<br />\nallowed the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences to be distressingly poor<br />\nwhile the Medical School was<br />\nvery rich. As in some families,<br />\nthe rich member was not inclined to contribute to a \"bail-out\"<br />\nof the poor cousin. In university<br />\nfinancing (as for personal credit<br />\ncards), there comes a time when<br />\none has to \"pay up.\" That's what<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan is about.<br />\nStudents are paying through increased tuition; the faculty,<br />\nespecially in A&amp;S, are paying<br />\nthrough smaller salary increases<br />\nand larger teaching loads. The<br />\nDivisions of Medicine, Engineering, and the Applied Pysics<br />\nLaboratory are contributing to a<br />\nreserve fund that will bring A&amp;S<br />\nout of debtors' prison.<br />\nFor my part, I like many of the<br />\ndevelopments of the Muller<br />\nyears. The more diverse<br />\nundergraduate student body is a<br />\npleasure to teach; merging<br />\nEngineering with A&amp;S was a<br />\nmistake\u2014the recreated Division<br />\nof Engineering is thriving; the addition of Peabody seems to me an<br />\nexcellent move for a university<br />\nlong on teaching theory but lacking in \"performance\" opportunities for its students, especially the undergraduates.<br />\nPerhaps the new president can<br />\nsolve the problems arising from<br />\ndivisional autonomy without<br />\neroding the special character of<br />\neach division; perhaps the new<br />\npresident will be a wizard fund<br />\nraiser, close friend to students<br />\nand faculty, and a noted scholar;<br />\nperhaps the Orioles will win the<br />\nWorld Series in 1989!<br /><br />\nto the March of Dimes<br />\nWalkathon, for example).

According to Testud, who has taken<br />\npart in five different markets, this<br />\none is the best, and that is why<br />\nhe chose to locate his store on<br />\nGreenmount.<br /><br />\n\"I like Greenmount Avenue.<br />\nIt's not a good area now, but I<br />\nthink in a few years it will be a<br />\ngood spot.\" A member of the<br />\nBetter Greenmount Alliance, he<br />\nsays, \"I think by this association<br />\nthere will be a change.\"<br />\nMany of the local residents<br />\ncome to Jocelyne's to take advantage of the goods that are not only baked fresh daily, but tend to<br />\nbe less expensive than the competition. The bakery enjoys the<br />\npatronage of 25 or 30 regular<br />\ncustomers, who come in daily to<br />\nbuy croissants.<br />\nAlthough they sell mostly<br />\nbreads and plain croissants, fancy croissants and pastries, and<br />\ncakes for wedding and birthdays<br />\nare also popular.<br />\n\"We sell what we bake. I have<br />\nsome other stuff, like pate<br />\nsausages, that a friend of mine<br />\nmakes,\" says Testud. \"I fix up<br />\nsandwiches for lunch, of pate and<br />\nsausages.\"<br />\nAccording to Testud, the<br />\nbakery's bread and butter is in the<br />\nwholesale business. He sells to<br /><br />\nhotels and other bakeries, the<br />\nlikes of Chez Fernand, Marconi's, The Bistro, and the Harbor Court Hotel.<br />\nDisplaying a post card with a<br />\ntypical French cafe, he regrets<br />\nthat there is nothing similar in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\n\"There are some cafes like this<br />\nin New York. In France,<br />\neverybody goes once a day to<br />\nsmoke, drink coffee, read the<br />\nnewspaper, or talk politics.\"<br />\nJocelyne's Bakery can be a bit<br />\ndifficult to find.

The store is<br />\nclosed Mondays, open Tuesday<br />\nthrough Friday from 8 a.m. to 6<br />\np.m., Saturday from noon until 6<br />\np.m., and Sunday from 9 a.m.<br />\nuntil noon.

But<br />\nvery few Hopkins students have<br />\nheard of the Babe Ruth Museum<br />\nright here in Baltimore.<br />\nThe museum, downtown at 216<br />\nEmory Street, is the actual house<br />\nin which Babe Ruth grew up. It<br />\nis actually made up of four<br />\nhouses, from 212 to 218, but part<br />\nof the original Babe Ruth house<br />\nis still preserved just as young<br />\nRuth would have remembered it.<br />\nOn the second floor visitors can<br />\nsee the very room where Babe<br />\nRuth was born on February 6,<br />\n1895. Outside the room are<br />\nvarious photos of the legend<br />\nthroughout the his life, as well as<br />\npersonal mementoes like his suitcase and his team photo when he<br />\nattended St. Mary's Industrial<br />\nSchool. His parents sent him<br />\naway to the reform school when<br />\nhe was only seven years old. It<br />\nwas at the school that he learned<br />\nto play baseball.<br />\nWord of Ruth's talent spread.<br />\nIn 1914 Jack Dunn, owner of the<br />\nminor league Baltimore Oribles,<br />\nsigned Ruth onto the team.<br />\nBecause he was only 18, he was<br />\ncalled Dunn's \"baby,\" or later,<br />\n\"Babe\" Ruth. The museum also<br />\nhas an exhibit on Jack Dunn as<br />\nwell as Jack Dunn II, III, and IV,<br />\nall of whom were and are active<br />\nin Baltimore baseball in various<br />\nroles.<br /><br />\nBabe Ruth was traded for<br />\n$3000 to pitch for the Boston Red<br />\nSox. His contract was then sold<br />\nto the New York Yankees in 1920<br />\nfor a phenomenal $125,000.<br />\nYankee Stadium, \"The House<br />\nThat Ruth Built,\" was designed<br />\nto hold the crowds that flocked to<br />\nsee the Babe hit. He set an incredible number of hitting<br />\nrecords before he retired from<br />\nplaying in 1935. In 1936 he was<br />\nelected to the Baseball Hall of<br />\nFame. He died of cancer in 1948.<br />\nThe museum is actually called<br />\nthe Babe Ruth Birthplace and<br />\nBaltimore Orioles Museum<br />\nbecause it contains more than just<br />\nBabe Ruth rememberances.<br />\nThere is a room dedicated to the<br />\nOrioles, filled with memorabilia<br />\nsince 1954, when they entered the<br />\nmajor leagues. There is the 1983<br />\nWorld Series trophy, numerous<br />\nuniforms, equipment, and awards<br />\nof players (including Jim<br />\nPalmer's Cy Young Award), as<br />\nwell as the Orioles Hall of Fame<br />\nwhich includes Brooks Robinson,<br />\nEarl Weaver, Ken Singleton, and<br />\nother Orioles greats.<br />\nA new addition to the museum<br />\nis the brand new Orioles<br />\nuniforms. These uniforms,<br />\nreflecting the first changes in<br />\neight years, have not even been<br />\nworn yet\u2014they will debut on<br />\nopening day.

Who says physics<br />\nisn't exciting?<br />\nA small group of Hopkins<br />\nphysicists have produced the<br />\nheart of one of the detectors of the<br />\nworld's premier particle accelerators. The job, to design and<br />\nbuild the equipment for the Large<br />\nElectron-Positron Collider(LEP)<br />\nwhich is being built in Geneva by<br />\nCERN, fell to Hopkins after a<br />\nlarge team at Northeastern<br />\nUniversity failed to produce a<br />\nworkable design after six years of<br />\ntrying. That was six months ago.<br />\nSince then, Dr. Aihud Pevsner,<br />\nlab director Jack Spangler, postdoc Homera Akbari, grad student<br />\nJian-Zhong Bao, Mechnical<br />\nEngineering professor Dr. Edwin<br />\nFitzgerald, his son Robert<br />\nFitzgerald, engineer Joe Orndorff, technician Dave Newman,<br />\ntwo machine shops, and two<br />\nundergraduates, Dan Durkin and<br />\nChris Kolda, have achieved what<br />\nseemed almost impossible around<br />\nChristmastime: to design and<br />\nconstruct the electronics for the<br />\nTime Expansion Chamber<br />\n(TEC), which will house and<br />\nregister the results of high energy<br />\ncollisions. Says Dr. Walker,<br />\n\"[Their achievement] was<br />\nmiraculous. . .1 didn't think they<br /><br />\ncould do it.\"<br />\nCERN,<br />\nthe<br />\nEuropean<br />\nOrganization for Nuclear<br />\nResearch, is an international<br />\nresearch facility in Geneva,<br />\nSwitzerland. Construction of LEP<br />\nbegan about six years ago, with<br />\nthe goal of studying the fundamental particles that make up<br />\nour universe. LEP creates beams<br />\nof fundamental particles, electrons and positrons, magnetically accelerates them around a 27kilometer circular track located<br />\nup to 100 meters underground,<br />\nand lets them collide at four sites<br />\naround the ring. The result of<br />\nthese tremendously high energy<br />\ncollisions is an assortment of particles that are recorded by detectors that encapsulate the collision<br />\nsite. These detectors are capable<br />\nof measuring the charge, mass,<br />\nand energy of the new particles.<br />\nPhysicists will analyze the data<br />\nfrom detectors, searching for<br />\nclues about how the universe is<br />\nheld together.<br />\nHigh-energy physics is the<br />\nstudy of what are believed to be<br />\nthe four fundamental forces of the<br />\nuniverse: the strong force, the<br />\nweak force, the electromagnetic<br />\nforce, and gravity. Experiments<br />\nat CERN have shown that, at high<br />\ntemperatures, where fundamental<br />\nparticles have a lot of energy, the<br />\nelectromagnetic and weak forces<br />\nunify to become the electroweak<br />\nforce. These results have led<br />\nphysicists to speculate that immediately after the Big Bang, the<br />\nexplosion which is believed to<br />\nhave started the universe, the<br />\ntemperature of the universe was<br /><br />\nle degrees Kelvin(103'degrees iglass wires\u2014fiber optics\u2014that are<br />\ncelsius plus 273.15 more).

Although he has been<br />\ncharged with five errors this<br />\nseason, (as many as he accumulated in 35 games last year),<br />\nBabb is unconcerned, deeming<br />\nthem \"lack of concentration\" errors. Timmerman and Bernstein<br />\nhave turned fourteen double plays<br />\nin fourteen games.<br /><br />\nPete Kwiterovich, Mike Zehring, and Ron Lewis have also<br />\nbeen central to the Jays' offensive<br />\nsuccess.

The man was dressed in snakeskin boots, with<br />\nleather pants and trenchcoat.<br />\nSenior Neil Seidman foolishly<br />\nasked him if he was, in fact, Jesse<br />\n\"the Body\" Ventura.

The<br />\nJays are a relatively young squad<br />\nthis season, though, and continue<br />\nto improve.<br />\nThe Jays opened their season at<br />\nLoyola on Tuesday, March 14,<br />\nwith a 6-3 loss. Hopkins' Lorin<br />\nEngquist defeated Tony Frontera<br />\nin straight sets, 7-6, 7-0, 6-4, at<br />\nfirst singles, and Francois<br />\nErasmus came back to defeat<br />\nLoyola's Chris Saumell 4-6, 6-3,<br />\n6-4 at sixth singes. Hopkins' Sean<br />\nGraham was narrowly defeated<br />\nby Bart Kelly in fourth singles<br />\nplay, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4).<br />\nOn Friday, March 17, Hopkins<br />\nhosted Drew, dropping that<br />\nmatch 8-1. Graham pulled out a<br />\nwin over Drew's Chip Miller<br />\nwith two narrow tie-breakers,<br />\n3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), saving<br />\nthe Jays from a shutout.<br />\nTuesday's 6-3 loss to Catholic<br />\nUniversity came down to the<br />\nJays' inexperience in the third set<br />\nof three singles matches, according to Coach Bill Nelson.<br />\nHolzman tried to come back with<br /><br />\nATTENTION<br />\nALL STUDENTS:<br />\nThe deadline to file your<br />\n1988 tax return is April 15,<br />\n1989.

No appointments are necessary, but we<br />\nsuggest you come early. For<br />\nmore information, call<br />\n338-8032.

Graham jumped<br />\nout in the first set at fourth<br />\nsingles, but a tie-breaker in the<br />\nsecond set allowed Catholic's<br />\nBrian Caughlin to rally in the<br />\nthird set for a 3-6, 7-6(7-5), 6-3<br />\nwin. The Jays' Erasmus could not<br />\nconvert his second-set victory into a match win, dropping at fifth<br />\nsingles to Bill Sallivy, 6-0, 4-6,<br />\n6-4. Engquist defeated CU's<br />\nMichael Rave in straight sets,<br />\n7-5, 6-1, and combined with<br />\nHolzman in first doubles to win<br />\nout over Rave and Brennan in a<br />\npro set, 8-1. Jon Missner and<br />\nGraham defeated Heckenberger<br />\nand Dave Grogan in the second<br />\ndoubles match 8-3 in a pro set.<br />\nAccording to Coach Nelson,<br />\nthe Jays are a young squad, with<br />\njust one senior and no junior<br />\nplayers. Three sophomores and<br />\nfour freshmen complete the<br />\nroster. Despite this inexperience,<br />\nCoach Nelson claims that his<br />\nteam has shown improvement<br />\nsince the Spring Break, pointing<br />\nout the match against Catholic<br /><br />\nUniversity as a turning point for<br />\nthe team.<br />\nThis season's squad is led by<br />\nsenior Jon Holzman, who plays<br />\nsecond singles, with sophomore<br />\nLorin Engquist holding the first<br />\nsingles slot. The two combine for<br />\nfirst doubles play. Sophomore<br />\nJon Missner, sophomore Sean<br />\nGraham, freshman Ted Roth, and<br />\nfreshman Francois Erasmus fill<br />\nout the remaining singles slots, in<br />\nthat order. The second and third<br />\ndoubles have been filled variously<br />\nfrom among them.<br />\nEngquist has been the most<br />\nconsistent player, with a personal<br />\nrecord of 2-1, dropping his only<br />\nmatch to Drew. He, Holzman,<br />\nMissner, and Graham are the<br />\nbackbone of the team, says Coach<br />\nNelson. Graham's 1-2 record is<br />\nmisleading because of losses in<br />\nthree-set matches due to tiebreakers.<br />\nThe Jays will play in the<br />\nTowson State Tournament this<br />\nweekend.

After intense bidding<br />\nby several major firms, the project was contracted to Eddie's<br />\nSupercolliders.

Besides, for an insolvent<br />\nuniversity division, we got an excellent interest rate.\"<br />\nThe loan was made by the Kentucky Fried Chicken Corpora-<br /><br />\ntion, the same company that<br />\nsponsored the \"space chicken\"<br />\nproject in which eggs were allowed to mature in orbit in the space<br />\nshuttle.<br />\nThe second phase of this project calls for the development of<br />\na low-gravity breading product,<br />\nby which the Colonel's extracrispy chicken could be created in<br />\nspace.<br />\nShould the University default<br />\non the loan, however, Kentucky<br />\nFried Chicken can assume ownership of the School. Should this<br />\nhappen, KFC spokesman Lt.<br />\nRhett Butler said students should<br />\nnot be concerned about any major changes.<br />\n\"Of course there'd be some<br />\nchanges in the food service<br />\naround these heya parts,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"Only minor change in the<br />\nacademics. For instance, we do<br />\nwant the philosophy to come up<br />\nwith an answer to that chicken<br />\nand egg question.\"<br />\nOther proposed changes would<br />\nbe a country music department at<br />\nthe Peabody, and a change to the<br />\nUniversity's motto.

He<br />\nsaid that such a device, which<br />\ntakes a few teensy-weensy little<br />\nparticles and smashes them apart<br />\ninto bunches of even smaller<br />\npieces, is necessary for studying<br />\nsubatomic particle physics. It also<br />\ngrinds great coffee, and it is the<br /><br />\nbest way known to pull apart<br />\nthings accidentally superglued<br />\ntogether.<br />\nAccording to Muller, the<br />\nchoice of Geneva as the location<br />\nfor the collider had nothing to do<br />\nwith making Hopkins visible in<br />\nthe European community.<br />\n\"I think we own enough of<br />\nBaltimore as it is, so I didn't want<br /><br />\nto build it here,\" he said. \"And<br />\nafter a while you get sick of sunny beaches and palm trees, so we<br />\nkept the project away from the<br />\ntropics.
