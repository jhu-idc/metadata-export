Calvert St., Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 19, 1926.<br />\n<br />\nAVOIDABLE UNPLEASANTNESS<br />\nThe Saturday night dances at Hopkins have always been a<br />\ngreat institution. Here, at least in theory, the hard-working<br />\nundergraduate, after a week presumably filled with study, may<br />\nrelax and enjoy himself without sacrificing the college atmosphere. The crowd, composed of his associates on the campus,<br />\nis congenial, the music good, the price low, in fact, conditions<br />\nseem to be ideal. .<br />\nBut, as we have long since discovered, ideal conditions rarely<br />\ncorrespond with facts. For several weeks, one of the unpleasant features of the Saturday night has been the indescriminate<br />\nparking of cars around the Civil Engineering Building. In<br />\nspite of the fact that there is ample parking space at .the end<br />\nof the drive, a few yards farther on, machines have been driven'<br />\nover the grass with no regard for the subsequent appearance of<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nMore unpleasant accounts, however, have reached us since the<br />\ndance last Saturday night. It seems that guests wandered<br />\nabout the dance floor With their hats on, unmindful of suggestions that it might be better to remove ;them. Throwing blackboard erasers provided amusement for Others and hat crushing in the men's cloak room proved popular. To cap the climax, someone appropriated a senior's car which was standing<br />\ndirectly in front of the building.<br />\nWe do not wish to apply a coat of whitewash to every'Hopkin's man, but it is certain that outsiders, who have,been attending the dances-in increasing numbers, were responsible for most<br />\nof the misconduct.<br />\nThe Gptillion Board should revert to its original policy of<br />\nrestricting attendance to Hopkins graduates and undergraduates, and to any friends who may accompany them.<br />\n<br />\nIT'S WORTH IT!<br />\n- --Half-the time allotted-to the Spring Season Ticket campaign<br />\nhas passed, and not enough tickets have been sold to pay for<br />\nthe expenses of the drive.<br />\nMost of the selling teams have fallen down on the job; and<br />\na general apathy prevails on the campus; the prospect of a dismal failure does not seem to have changed the attitude of \"let<br />\nthe others do it.\" No worse spirit could develop among the.<br />\nstudent body, and it cOuld come at no worse time. We are not<br />\nexaggerating when we make the statement that the outcome of<br />\nthe present ticket drive will profoundly affect all future athletics at Hopkins.<br />\nDr.. Goodnow has announced that we will have athletics as<br />\nlong as they are self-supporting, and as long as the students<br />\nshow that they want athletics. Our athletics are neither overorganized nor over emphasized, but they cannot be run on nothing\u2014and the money must come either from gate receipts or<br />\nseason ticket sales.<br />\nAlready, baseball has been dropped on account of its expense.<br />\nThe fate of the two remaining spring sports rests with you\u2014or<br />\nrather us, for the NEWS-LETTER does not wish to dodge the responsibility. Indifference toward the campaign will cripple<br />\nathletics, and will go far toward convincing the Board of Trustees that the students no longer want athletics. Loyal support<br />\nof the drive will put lacrosse and track on their feet, and will<br />\nprove that we still want sports.<br />\n\u2022 There is no middle course.

Calvert St., Baltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 19, 1926.<br /><br />\nAVOIDABLE UNPLEASANTNESS<br />\nThe Saturday night dances at Hopkins have always been a<br />\ngreat institution. Here, at least in theory, the hard-working<br />\nundergraduate, after a week presumably filled with study, may<br />\nrelax and enjoy himself without sacrificing the college atmosphere. The crowd, composed of his associates on the campus,<br />\nis congenial, the music good, the price low, in fact, conditions<br />\nseem to be ideal. .<br />\nBut, as we have long since discovered, ideal conditions rarely<br />\ncorrespond with facts. For several weeks, one of the unpleasant features of the Saturday night has been the indescriminate<br />\nparking of cars around the Civil Engineering Building. In<br />\nspite of the fact that there is ample parking space at .the end<br />\nof the drive, a few yards farther on, machines have been driven'<br />\nover the grass with no regard for the subsequent appearance of<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nMore unpleasant accounts, however, have reached us since the<br />\ndance last Saturday night. It seems that guests wandered<br />\nabout the dance floor With their hats on, unmindful of suggestions that it might be better to remove ;them. Throwing blackboard erasers provided amusement for Others and hat crushing in the men's cloak room proved popular. To cap the climax, someone appropriated a senior's car which was standing<br />\ndirectly in front of the building.<br />\nWe do not wish to apply a coat of whitewash to every'Hopkin's man, but it is certain that outsiders, who have,been attending the dances-in increasing numbers, were responsible for most<br />\nof the misconduct.<br />\nThe Gptillion Board should revert to its original policy of<br />\nrestricting attendance to Hopkins graduates and undergraduates, and to any friends who may accompany them.<br /><br />\nIT'S WORTH IT!<br />\n- --Half-the time allotted-to the Spring Season Ticket campaign<br />\nhas passed, and not enough tickets have been sold to pay for<br />\nthe expenses of the drive.<br />\nMost of the selling teams have fallen down on the job; and<br />\na general apathy prevails on the campus; the prospect of a dismal failure does not seem to have changed the attitude of \"let<br />\nthe others do it.\" No worse spirit could develop among the.<br />\nstudent body, and it cOuld come at no worse time. We are not<br />\nexaggerating when we make the statement that the outcome of<br />\nthe present ticket drive will profoundly affect all future athletics at Hopkins.<br />\nDr.. Goodnow has announced that we will have athletics as<br />\nlong as they are self-supporting, and as long as the students<br />\nshow that they want athletics. Our athletics are neither overorganized nor over emphasized, but they cannot be run on nothing\u2014and the money must come either from gate receipts or<br />\nseason ticket sales.<br />\nAlready, baseball has been dropped on account of its expense.<br />\nThe fate of the two remaining spring sports rests with you\u2014or<br />\nrather us, for the NEWS-LETTER does not wish to dodge the responsibility. Indifference toward the campaign will cripple<br />\nathletics, and will go far toward convincing the Board of Trustees that the students no longer want athletics. Loyal support<br />\nof the drive will put lacrosse and track on their feet, and will<br />\nprove that we still want sports.<br />\n\u2022 There is no middle course.
