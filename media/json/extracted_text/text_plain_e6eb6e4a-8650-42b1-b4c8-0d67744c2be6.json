Another set of twin urns,<br />\nsaid Miss Freeman, Curator of<br />\nFine Arts at the Hopkins, contains the remains of a husband<br />\nand wife.<br />\nMiss Freeman tells a little anecdote in conneutiVrwith these lastmentioned urns. It seems that<br />\nwhen a former Professor of Art<br />\nand Archaeology at the Hopkins,<br />\nDr. David M. Robinson, brought<br />\nthem into the States, the red-<br />\n<br />\nRULER ON THE REACHING KNUCKLES<br />\nFew bother to rationalize the existence of an Honor System at<br />\nHomewood. Ideally there is no reason to do so. For the vast majority<br />\nwhich unconsciously follows its rules, probably through sheer persottal habit, it is something rather obvious\u2014a natural part of a<br />\nmature campus life. For the few who ignore it, breaking its rules<br />\nthrough similar habits, it is merely a happy institution which makes<br />\ncheating easier. \u2022<br />\nThe HonorTommission realizet that the ideal is one in which<br />\nthe System is so completely taken for granted that there is no<br />\nquestion of _violating its codes. But in its present' state, and frequent commission trials verify this, the-iystem is being taken too<br />\nmuch for granted by both the violators and non-violators.<br />\nThe trials point to the fact that the ideal condition will not<br />\nbe achieved if the system is merely accepted passively. The apparent need is for interested students who understand the value of<br />\nthe Honor System at Hopkins (especially in comparison with<br />\nproctor siitems at other colleges) to actively support it, reporting<br />\nviolations and bringing into play the recently stressed warning<br />\nsystem.<br />\n<br />\nFOOD FOR THE LUNCH EATERS<br />\nThe accomplishments of the Student Council in the recent<br />\nbookstore investigation should bring it much closer to an under!handing of its real powers and potentialities than any of its<br />\nsupposedly definite constitutions.<br />\nThe Council's research \u2022and planning will soon result in a<br />\ncampus used-book shop. The project was as smooth an operation<br />\nas the council ,has witnessed in -the post-war years.-.<br />\nThe original investigation had found that while tl* bookstore<br />\nwas definitely operating on a non-profit basis there was still an<br />\nobvious need for lower priced books.<br />\nFor the council the immediate answer was the setting up of a<br />\npermanent committee charged with the responsibility for outlining the basic form of a second-hand- bookstore. The result was the<br />\nspeedy formulation of a plan which will soon be incorporated into<br />\nan outlet for students' discarded: texts and at the same time a<br />\nsource of Ilse& books for students who do not want to pay the<br />\nprice of new editions. The committee's final suggestion, perhaps<br />\n, its most significant, was that the council ielinquish 'contiol of the<br />\nproject after its inceptioh and turn the store over to an equally<br />\nresponsible but less transitory organization. \u2022<br />\nFor the activities-minded student, frequently searching for a<br />\nreason behind the Student Council's existence on campus, this<br />\nproject should provide a fairly tangible answer. There is an apparent need on any college campus for an activity which has the basic<br />\nmachinery for suggesting and outlining methods of campus improvement and in this action the council has come as close to fulfilling this need as it could be expected to in any single instance.<br />\nAs long as the council is willing to accept the fact that what<br />\nHopkins needs in the way of a Student Council is ap alert body<br />\nwhich can provide suggestions for the improvement of campus<br />\nconditions, it will be forming 8( definitely important function.<br />\nWhen it begins searching for power (setting itself up<br />\nthe<br />\n\"official activities coordinating body\" or guardian of school<br />\nspirit as it has in previous cases and years) it is merely providing<br />\nanother activity to fill the Hullabaloo pages.<br />\n<br />\nEgyptian figurines in very good state of preservation showing detail and Witness in form.

Another set of twin urns,<br />\nsaid Miss Freeman, Curator of<br />\nFine Arts at the Hopkins, contains the remains of a husband<br />\nand wife.<br />\nMiss Freeman tells a little anecdote in conneutiVrwith these lastmentioned urns. It seems that<br />\nwhen a former Professor of Art<br />\nand Archaeology at the Hopkins,<br />\nDr. David M. Robinson, brought<br />\nthem into the States, the red-<br /><br />\nRULER ON THE REACHING KNUCKLES<br />\nFew bother to rationalize the existence of an Honor System at<br />\nHomewood. Ideally there is no reason to do so. For the vast majority<br />\nwhich unconsciously follows its rules, probably through sheer persottal habit, it is something rather obvious\u2014a natural part of a<br />\nmature campus life. For the few who ignore it, breaking its rules<br />\nthrough similar habits, it is merely a happy institution which makes<br />\ncheating easier. \u2022<br />\nThe HonorTommission realizet that the ideal is one in which<br />\nthe System is so completely taken for granted that there is no<br />\nquestion of _violating its codes. But in its present' state, and frequent commission trials verify this, the-iystem is being taken too<br />\nmuch for granted by both the violators and non-violators.<br />\nThe trials point to the fact that the ideal condition will not<br />\nbe achieved if the system is merely accepted passively. The apparent need is for interested students who understand the value of<br />\nthe Honor System at Hopkins (especially in comparison with<br />\nproctor siitems at other colleges) to actively support it, reporting<br />\nviolations and bringing into play the recently stressed warning<br />\nsystem.<br /><br />\nFOOD FOR THE LUNCH EATERS<br />\nThe accomplishments of the Student Council in the recent<br />\nbookstore investigation should bring it much closer to an under!handing of its real powers and potentialities than any of its<br />\nsupposedly definite constitutions.<br />\nThe Council's research \u2022and planning will soon result in a<br />\ncampus used-book shop. The project was as smooth an operation<br />\nas the council ,has witnessed in -the post-war years.-.<br />\nThe original investigation had found that while tl* bookstore<br />\nwas definitely operating on a non-profit basis there was still an<br />\nobvious need for lower priced books.<br />\nFor the council the immediate answer was the setting up of a<br />\npermanent committee charged with the responsibility for outlining the basic form of a second-hand- bookstore. The result was the<br />\nspeedy formulation of a plan which will soon be incorporated into<br />\nan outlet for students' discarded: texts and at the same time a<br />\nsource of Ilse&amp; books for students who do not want to pay the<br />\nprice of new editions. The committee's final suggestion, perhaps<br />\n, its most significant, was that the council ielinquish 'contiol of the<br />\nproject after its inceptioh and turn the store over to an equally<br />\nresponsible but less transitory organization. \u2022<br />\nFor the activities-minded student, frequently searching for a<br />\nreason behind the Student Council's existence on campus, this<br />\nproject should provide a fairly tangible answer. There is an apparent need on any college campus for an activity which has the basic<br />\nmachinery for suggesting and outlining methods of campus improvement and in this action the council has come as close to fulfilling this need as it could be expected to in any single instance.<br />\nAs long as the council is willing to accept the fact that what<br />\nHopkins needs in the way of a Student Council is ap alert body<br />\nwhich can provide suggestions for the improvement of campus<br />\nconditions, it will be forming 8( definitely important function.<br />\nWhen it begins searching for power (setting itself up<br />\nthe<br />\n\"official activities coordinating body\" or guardian of school<br />\nspirit as it has in previous cases and years) it is merely providing<br />\nanother activity to fill the Hullabaloo pages.<br /><br />\nEgyptian figurines in very good state of preservation showing detail and Witness in form.
