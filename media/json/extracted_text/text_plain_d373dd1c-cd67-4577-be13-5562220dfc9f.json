C. \\\\*.<br />\n<br />\nABOLISHING ENGLISH COMPOSITION<br />\n<br />\nIt has come to our attention that it is the plan of the administration to drop English Composition from -the list of courses<br />\noffered to freshmen in 1928-29. This year a partial step in that<br />\ndirection was taken when entering students were required to take<br />\nan examination in composition, which, if passed with a grade of<br />\n7.5 or better, served to absolve the student from taking the course.<br />\nAbout one hundred and twenty-five freshmen were required to<br />\ntake the course.<br />\nThese one hundred and twenty-five men, with very few exceptions, need the course in composition, and need it badly. The<br />\nquality of their work in English, according to the instructors, is<br />\ndefinitely poor.<br />\nWe can say with assurance that if any of these freshmen were<br />\nallowed to receive a degree with their present ability to use the<br />\nEnglish language, the University would be distinctly disgraced.<br />\nOf course, it is possible that a fairly large proportion of them will<br />\nnever be graduated, but it is hardly fair either to the men who<br />\nwill receive degrees or to the University itself to deprive them of<br />\nthe advanced training in English. It is easy enough to maintain<br />\nthat they should come to college fully prepared, but if they are<br />\nnot prepared, it is up to the University to provide the necessary<br />\ntraining.<br />\nThe present system is perfectly adequate. The men who can<br />\npass the preliminary examination are not burdened with having<br />\nto take English Composition, but to assume that all entering<br />\nstudents, regardless of their intelligence or their preparation in<br />\nother subjects, are adequately prepared in English, would be a<br />\ngreat mistake. Too many freshmen need English Composition<br />\nto permit its being abolished.<br />\n<br />\nIt is some time since I resolved to<br />\ncease the practice of penning pernicious rot for public perusal, but<br />\nafter reading an article in the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER of February 28, I<br />\nfeel the urge to enter some sort of<br />\ndefense of these vile fraternity boys<br />\nwho hate each other and do nothing but figure. out ways to cut each<br />\nother's throats in gentlemanly ways.<br />\nThe bad feeling between chapters<br />\nis easily explained\u2014it is a conceit\u2014if I may use the term of each<br />\nindividual that he may improve his<br />\nown standing by declaiming to the<br />\nworld at large that such-and-such<br />\nis a crowd of loafers, drunks or<br />\nwhat have you. If asked for his<br />\nconfidential opinion of the same<br />\nbody he would have no complaint<br />\nexcept, possibly, against a few individuals whom he would hold in<br />\nthe same contempt, fraternity men<br />\nor otherwise.<br />\nPerhaps the Alphas are hig-hat<br />\nor the Sigmas are drunks\u2014did you<br />\never consider the fact that the former may have reason for their lofty<br />\nattitude and the latter may be able<br />\nto pay bootleggers' prices and the<br />\ncriticism of these groups may be<br />\ncaused by jealousy?<br />\nI am quite sure that the abolition<br />\nof fraternities would have no affect<br />\non the present condition, for a man<br />\nmust have companions, and since it<br />\nis obviously impossible to associate<br />\nwith the entire student body one<br />\nmust limit himself to a selected<br />\ngroup of men with whom he at least<br />\nfancies himself happy. That this<br />\nis true is proved by the men on the<br />\n'campus who are not affiliated with<br />\nany fraternity. They have their<br />\ngroups and are no doubt influenced<br />\nby each other as much as their unfortunate mates who are members<br />\nof an organized brotherhood. The<br />\nconditions at Hopkins are not conducive to the fostering of a type for<br />\nany one fraternity. The real influence in this direction becomes<br />\nstrong only when the majority of<br />\nthe brothers live under one roof, eat<br />\nat the same table and wear each<br />\nother's clothes.<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nHAGERSTOWN VERSUS NORFOLK<br />\nIn abandoning its Norfolk concert for the trip to Hagerstown<br />\nand Chambersburg, the Musical Club has acted very wisely. The<br />\nNorfolk trip never had been a success, either from a financial<br />\nstandpoint or from the point of view of the applause and appreciation received; the Hagerstown and Ch'ambersburg audiences, on<br />\nthe other hand, were most enthusiastic and supported the concerts<br />\nsurprisingly well.<br />\nIt stands to reason, after all, that the smaller towns offer a<br />\nmore fertile field for the presentations of the club. In the first<br />\nplace, the annual trip of the Geology I class has established a<br />\nreputation for Hopkins students that probably did much for the<br />\nMusical Club's cause. In the second place, the relative scarcity<br />\nof decent entertainment in small towns gives the club a better<br />\nchance to draw large crowds. It is far better to be able to hang<br />\nout the \"S. R. 0.\" sign in Hagerstown than to play to an empty<br />\nhouse in Norfolk.<br />\n<br />\nANOTHER ACHIEVEMENT<br />\nAnother chapter in the history of the achievements of Hopkins<br />\nmen has been written at the site of the lost city of Olynthus,<br />\nrecently discovered by Dr. David M. Robinson, professor of<br />\nArchaeology at this University. ; Dr. Robinson, on leave of absence for a year, has made a discovery which may prove to be of<br />\ninestimable value to students of Greek civilization all over the<br />\nworld. The NEWS-LETTER takes this opportunity to congratulate<br />\nhim in the name of the student body.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER is pleased to announce the election of Gus<br />\nBurke, '31, as assistant business manager.<br />\n<br />\nAs for the corruption of the campus by fraternity politics\u2014there<br />\nwould be no less mud thrown or<br />\nno better men elected to the various<br />\noffices than at present if the elections<br />\nwere removed from the influence<br />\nof fraternities.. Instead of a political deal being made, the hero of the<br />\nhour would be elected and he would<br />\nbe just as incompetent \u2014 if not<br />\nmore so\u2014than our present afflictions. And think of the valuable<br />\nexperience in fooling the public our<br />\nupperclassmen will receive, not to<br />\nmention the thrill of believing<br />\nthey've put one over on the supposedly unsuspecting campus.

Why? Because a<br />\nman feels that he should do something for his fraternity, however<br />\nsmall the contribution, and the<br />\nbest way is to work for some activity. Here he meets men of other<br />\ngroups, and if he is any kind of a<br />\nman he make friends.

C. \\\\*.<br /><br />\nABOLISHING ENGLISH COMPOSITION<br /><br />\nIt has come to our attention that it is the plan of the administration to drop English Composition from -the list of courses<br />\noffered to freshmen in 1928-29. This year a partial step in that<br />\ndirection was taken when entering students were required to take<br />\nan examination in composition, which, if passed with a grade of<br />\n7.5 or better, served to absolve the student from taking the course.<br />\nAbout one hundred and twenty-five freshmen were required to<br />\ntake the course.<br />\nThese one hundred and twenty-five men, with very few exceptions, need the course in composition, and need it badly. The<br />\nquality of their work in English, according to the instructors, is<br />\ndefinitely poor.<br />\nWe can say with assurance that if any of these freshmen were<br />\nallowed to receive a degree with their present ability to use the<br />\nEnglish language, the University would be distinctly disgraced.<br />\nOf course, it is possible that a fairly large proportion of them will<br />\nnever be graduated, but it is hardly fair either to the men who<br />\nwill receive degrees or to the University itself to deprive them of<br />\nthe advanced training in English. It is easy enough to maintain<br />\nthat they should come to college fully prepared, but if they are<br />\nnot prepared, it is up to the University to provide the necessary<br />\ntraining.<br />\nThe present system is perfectly adequate. The men who can<br />\npass the preliminary examination are not burdened with having<br />\nto take English Composition, but to assume that all entering<br />\nstudents, regardless of their intelligence or their preparation in<br />\nother subjects, are adequately prepared in English, would be a<br />\ngreat mistake. Too many freshmen need English Composition<br />\nto permit its being abolished.<br /><br />\nIt is some time since I resolved to<br />\ncease the practice of penning pernicious rot for public perusal, but<br />\nafter reading an article in the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER of February 28, I<br />\nfeel the urge to enter some sort of<br />\ndefense of these vile fraternity boys<br />\nwho hate each other and do nothing but figure. out ways to cut each<br />\nother's throats in gentlemanly ways.<br />\nThe bad feeling between chapters<br />\nis easily explained\u2014it is a conceit\u2014if I may use the term of each<br />\nindividual that he may improve his<br />\nown standing by declaiming to the<br />\nworld at large that such-and-such<br />\nis a crowd of loafers, drunks or<br />\nwhat have you. If asked for his<br />\nconfidential opinion of the same<br />\nbody he would have no complaint<br />\nexcept, possibly, against a few individuals whom he would hold in<br />\nthe same contempt, fraternity men<br />\nor otherwise.<br />\nPerhaps the Alphas are hig-hat<br />\nor the Sigmas are drunks\u2014did you<br />\never consider the fact that the former may have reason for their lofty<br />\nattitude and the latter may be able<br />\nto pay bootleggers' prices and the<br />\ncriticism of these groups may be<br />\ncaused by jealousy?<br />\nI am quite sure that the abolition<br />\nof fraternities would have no affect<br />\non the present condition, for a man<br />\nmust have companions, and since it<br />\nis obviously impossible to associate<br />\nwith the entire student body one<br />\nmust limit himself to a selected<br />\ngroup of men with whom he at least<br />\nfancies himself happy. That this<br />\nis true is proved by the men on the<br />\n'campus who are not affiliated with<br />\nany fraternity. They have their<br />\ngroups and are no doubt influenced<br />\nby each other as much as their unfortunate mates who are members<br />\nof an organized brotherhood. The<br />\nconditions at Hopkins are not conducive to the fostering of a type for<br />\nany one fraternity. The real influence in this direction becomes<br />\nstrong only when the majority of<br />\nthe brothers live under one roof, eat<br />\nat the same table and wear each<br />\nother's clothes.<br />\nII<br /><br />\nHAGERSTOWN VERSUS NORFOLK<br />\nIn abandoning its Norfolk concert for the trip to Hagerstown<br />\nand Chambersburg, the Musical Club has acted very wisely. The<br />\nNorfolk trip never had been a success, either from a financial<br />\nstandpoint or from the point of view of the applause and appreciation received; the Hagerstown and Ch'ambersburg audiences, on<br />\nthe other hand, were most enthusiastic and supported the concerts<br />\nsurprisingly well.<br />\nIt stands to reason, after all, that the smaller towns offer a<br />\nmore fertile field for the presentations of the club. In the first<br />\nplace, the annual trip of the Geology I class has established a<br />\nreputation for Hopkins students that probably did much for the<br />\nMusical Club's cause. In the second place, the relative scarcity<br />\nof decent entertainment in small towns gives the club a better<br />\nchance to draw large crowds. It is far better to be able to hang<br />\nout the \"S. R. 0.\" sign in Hagerstown than to play to an empty<br />\nhouse in Norfolk.<br /><br />\nANOTHER ACHIEVEMENT<br />\nAnother chapter in the history of the achievements of Hopkins<br />\nmen has been written at the site of the lost city of Olynthus,<br />\nrecently discovered by Dr. David M. Robinson, professor of<br />\nArchaeology at this University. ; Dr. Robinson, on leave of absence for a year, has made a discovery which may prove to be of<br />\ninestimable value to students of Greek civilization all over the<br />\nworld. The NEWS-LETTER takes this opportunity to congratulate<br />\nhim in the name of the student body.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER is pleased to announce the election of Gus<br />\nBurke, '31, as assistant business manager.<br /><br />\nAs for the corruption of the campus by fraternity politics\u2014there<br />\nwould be no less mud thrown or<br />\nno better men elected to the various<br />\noffices than at present if the elections<br />\nwere removed from the influence<br />\nof fraternities.. Instead of a political deal being made, the hero of the<br />\nhour would be elected and he would<br />\nbe just as incompetent \u2014 if not<br />\nmore so\u2014than our present afflictions. And think of the valuable<br />\nexperience in fooling the public our<br />\nupperclassmen will receive, not to<br />\nmention the thrill of believing<br />\nthey've put one over on the supposedly unsuspecting campus.
