According to the official statement as it appears on Page 1, both<br />\nparties concerned were considered guilty<br />\nin several respects, and consequently no<br />\nthorough acquittal could be tendered<br />\neither side. As far as the Council is concerned, this decision is final and the incident stands as closed.<br />\nAnalyzing the report, ,step by step, we<br />\ndo not approve of the Council's apparent<br />\n;censoring of the three organizations involved in the strike on the ground that<br />\nthe number of their members sponsoring<br />\nthe movement reached a total of less<br />\nthan 50 students. We believe that the<br />\nnumber of the anti-war demonstrators is<br />\nirrelevant; the paramount and deciding<br />\nissue, in our eyes, is the cause for which<br />\nthey were demonstrating. And we have<br />\nnot changed in the least bit our opinion,<br />\nexpressed in Tuesday's NEWIS-LETTER,<br />\nthat that cause was, is, and forever will<br />\nbe a just one and one worth striving for,<br />\nwhether by one man or a million.<br />\nOur original views anent the strikers'<br />\ndisrupting of the usual classroom procedure in an effort to make the Meeting more<br />\nspectacular and significant (the Council<br />\nshould have used the latter adjective, too)<br />\nhave also not been altered by three additional days of concentrated consideration. It was the only method, as we see<br />\nit, whereby the proper emphasis could be<br />\nplaced upon the movement. After all,<br />\nasking frankly as is our wont, what loss<br />\nwas suffered by the student because of<br />\nthe one hour classroom interlude? And<br />\njust as frankly we answer ourselves, no<br />\nloss whatsoever. We cannot conceive of<br />\na single course in the University which<br />\nis so much more pertinent and necessary<br />\nto the student's welfare and education,<br />\nin contrast with the question' of war,<br />\nthat as a result he would consider the<br />\nsacrifice of thirty minutes an irreparable<br />\nloss. Unfortunately, we have yet to find<br />\nany study which could fill this requirement. When and'if we do, we shall<br />\nmore than likely terminate this mundane<br />\nlife of ours right then and there and devote the remainder of our mortal existence to the pursuit of this all-too-overpowering subject.<br />\nThen, again, we must not lose sight<br />\nof the fact that those undergraduates who<br />\nunswervingly chant \"We love our<br />\ncourse\" or who were opposed to the<br />\nmeeting because of its very nature were<br />\nnot compelled to attend. The former<br />\ngroup could have remained sequestered<br />\nwith their books to their hearts' content, while the latter could have achieved<br />\nthe double triumph of leaving class and<br />\nspending the following hour at leisure.<br />\nSince they were distinctly disinterested,<br />\ntheir presence at the meeting was certainly not prompted by any commendable<br />\ndesires.<br />\nAs for the \"disrespectful conduct to<br />\ninstructors\" which this action was<br />\ndeemed to have displayed, here also we<br />\n<br />\nper any subsequent disturbances; no action unaccompanied by force could occomplish this end. Rather, we feel that<br />\nnow that the Council has required that it<br />\nbe apprised of such meetings in order that<br />\nit may aid in their proper management,<br />\nsuch childish issues as the personnel and<br />\nmethods of procedure of the strikers will<br />\nno longer be regarded as potential arguments for would-be vandals.<br />\nWe strongly advise those students who<br />\nwere so severely reprimanded yesterday<br />\nto derive the moral embodied therein.<br />\nThis applies especially to the freshmen,<br />\nwhose all-too genuine fear could not be<br />\nmasked by their affected indifference<br />\nwhile waiting for the Councl to pass<br />\njudgment.

At midnight the Council<br />\npresident and the editor of the NEWSLETTER had a personal interview, at<br />\nwhich time Ed Sadtler handed over the<br />\nreport of the group for immediate publication and discussed at length the measures which had been enacted.<br />\nObviously, the Council has steered a<br />\nmiddle course in the affair, in *that it<br />\ndid not align itself definitely with one<br />\nof the two contending factions to the<br />\ntotal or even partial exclusion of the<br />\nother. According to the official statement as it appears on Page 1, both<br />\nparties concerned were considered guilty<br />\nin several respects, and consequently no<br />\nthorough acquittal could be tendered<br />\neither side. As far as the Council is concerned, this decision is final and the incident stands as closed.<br />\nAnalyzing the report, ,step by step, we<br />\ndo not approve of the Council's apparent<br />\n;censoring of the three organizations involved in the strike on the ground that<br />\nthe number of their members sponsoring<br />\nthe movement reached a total of less<br />\nthan 50 students. We believe that the<br />\nnumber of the anti-war demonstrators is<br />\nirrelevant; the paramount and deciding<br />\nissue, in our eyes, is the cause for which<br />\nthey were demonstrating. And we have<br />\nnot changed in the least bit our opinion,<br />\nexpressed in Tuesday's NEWIS-LETTER,<br />\nthat that cause was, is, and forever will<br />\nbe a just one and one worth striving for,<br />\nwhether by one man or a million.<br />\nOur original views anent the strikers'<br />\ndisrupting of the usual classroom procedure in an effort to make the Meeting more<br />\nspectacular and significant (the Council<br />\nshould have used the latter adjective, too)<br />\nhave also not been altered by three additional days of concentrated consideration. It was the only method, as we see<br />\nit, whereby the proper emphasis could be<br />\nplaced upon the movement. After all,<br />\nasking frankly as is our wont, what loss<br />\nwas suffered by the student because of<br />\nthe one hour classroom interlude? And<br />\njust as frankly we answer ourselves, no<br />\nloss whatsoever. We cannot conceive of<br />\na single course in the University which<br />\nis so much more pertinent and necessary<br />\nto the student's welfare and education,<br />\nin contrast with the question' of war,<br />\nthat as a result he would consider the<br />\nsacrifice of thirty minutes an irreparable<br />\nloss. Unfortunately, we have yet to find<br />\nany study which could fill this requirement. When and'if we do, we shall<br />\nmore than likely terminate this mundane<br />\nlife of ours right then and there and devote the remainder of our mortal existence to the pursuit of this all-too-overpowering subject.<br />\nThen, again, we must not lose sight<br />\nof the fact that those undergraduates who<br />\nunswervingly chant \"We love our<br />\ncourse\" or who were opposed to the<br />\nmeeting because of its very nature were<br />\nnot compelled to attend. The former<br />\ngroup could have remained sequestered<br />\nwith their books to their hearts' content, while the latter could have achieved<br />\nthe double triumph of leaving class and<br />\nspending the following hour at leisure.<br />\nSince they were distinctly disinterested,<br />\ntheir presence at the meeting was certainly not prompted by any commendable<br />\ndesires.<br />\nAs for the \"disrespectful conduct to<br />\ninstructors\" which this action was<br />\ndeemed to have displayed, here also we<br /><br />\nper any subsequent disturbances; no action unaccompanied by force could occomplish this end. Rather, we feel that<br />\nnow that the Council has required that it<br />\nbe apprised of such meetings in order that<br />\nit may aid in their proper management,<br />\nsuch childish issues as the personnel and<br />\nmethods of procedure of the strikers will<br />\nno longer be regarded as potential arguments for would-be vandals.<br />\nWe strongly advise those students who<br />\nwere so severely reprimanded yesterday<br />\nto derive the moral embodied therein.<br />\nThis applies especially to the freshmen,<br />\nwhose all-too genuine fear could not be<br />\nmasked by their affected indifference<br />\nwhile waiting for the Councl to pass<br />\njudgment.
