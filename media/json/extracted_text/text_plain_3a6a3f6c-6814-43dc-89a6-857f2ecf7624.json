The<br />\nHomewood campus's oldest and<br />\nleast known dormitory is located<br />\non the third floor of the chemistry building, and consists of<br />\nthree rooms with two beds in<br />\neach.<br />\n\"You wouldn't exactly call it<br />\nthe Remsen Hilton,\" said Morris<br />\nBursey, a researcher who's working for his Ph.D. in organic<br />\nchemistry, and who's been a<br />\ntenant since last July.<br />\n\"Morris,\" warned a female coworker's voice from the background, \"you'd better be careful what you say.\"<br />\nBursey admitted that he'd<br />\nbetter watch his words, lest he<br />\n\"start a war between the chemistry department and the Plant<br />\nManager.\" But one lament to the<br />\nlandlord never hurt anybody, so<br />\nhe unofficially registered the following complaint.<br />\n\"The radiators never work,<br />\nand when they get around to fixing them they do it at 7:30 in<br />\nthe morning, when everyone's<br />\nasleep. You might say it's disconcerting.\" At one point, the<br />\nsix boarders resorted to electric<br />\nheaters to warm the place, only<br />\n<br />\nThe H4U Driving Committee is in many respects<br />\nan anomaly on the Hopkins Campus, neither fish nor<br />\nfowl. The committee obviously does not represent either<br />\nthe Junior Class or the student body as a whole. In fact<br />\nthe H4U Committee simply consists of 27 juniors appointed by Joe Perotto and functions by assuming various responsibilities belonging to other campus organizations. The fact that Perotto continually refers to the<br />\ncommittee as representative of the student body is merely<br />\na confusion which is totally unwarranted. Moreover,<br />\nthe very nature of this committee insures Perotto's complete control.<br />\nIt is admirable that Perotto and 'his' committee<br />\nhave had the drive to initiate some of the programs<br />\nthat they have. However, sheer energy, as such, means<br />\nlittle. Though it cannot be denied that some of the<br />\n114U acomplishments are desirable, it is probable, that<br />\nsome of this work has been harmful or questionable.<br />\nFor example, on what basis can the H4U Committee<br />\nsponsor a dance in the Spring? The committee is not<br />\n11111111111111111<br />\nan official campus organization and as such has no<br />\nbusiness running a dance. Who will be responsible in<br />\nthe event of financial loss?

When a professional fund raiser is looking for<br />\ndonations in the six figure range, $50 is, at most, an<br />\nembarrassment.<br />\nPerotto may have the best intention, but some of Theatre: La Plume de ma Twit.,<br />\nsophisticated French revue,<br />\nhis methods are wrong.

If he feels that the<br />\npersonnel of these organiaztions is at fault, then he has<br />\nthe recourse of electing new and better representatives<br />\nthrough publicity, active support of his candidates, and<br />\nformation of a political party.<br />\nIn the long run Perotto's incessant activity and<br />\npressure can create only harm. At the moment it would<br />\nseem that he is in active, though extralegal, competition<br />\nwith the student government bodies at Hopkins. This<br />\ncompetition can not result in long range benefits, inspite of any initial, dramatic successes it may have. Already Perotto's usurpation of power has led the Student Council to counter by establishing a committee for<br />\nlong range planning of campus projects.<br />\nIt would seem that if Perotto is truly sincere in<br />\nhis avowed desire to better undergraduate life on the<br />\nHomewood campus, his first and necessary step would<br />\nbe to abandon his committee and channel his energies<br />\ninto the proper organizations.<br />\n<br />\nREMSE N<br />\nHALL<br />\n<br />\no/<br />\n<br />\nr-r-<br />\n<br />\nHOME<br />\n<br />\nswee'r<br />\nmonE<br />\n<br />\n4111111<br />\n<br />\nNEM..<br />\n<br />\nititil1similim11ii111111111111111111ilMi1<br />\n<br />\nY.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\netlftAV':;46.0<br />\n<br />\nto be the victims of a blown fuse Morris Reagan, Aaron Su,.

The<br />\nHomewood campus's oldest and<br />\nleast known dormitory is located<br />\non the third floor of the chemistry building, and consists of<br />\nthree rooms with two beds in<br />\neach.<br />\n\"You wouldn't exactly call it<br />\nthe Remsen Hilton,\" said Morris<br />\nBursey, a researcher who's working for his Ph.D. in organic<br />\nchemistry, and who's been a<br />\ntenant since last July.<br />\n\"Morris,\" warned a female coworker's voice from the background, \"you'd better be careful what you say.\"<br />\nBursey admitted that he'd<br />\nbetter watch his words, lest he<br />\n\"start a war between the chemistry department and the Plant<br />\nManager.\" But one lament to the<br />\nlandlord never hurt anybody, so<br />\nhe unofficially registered the following complaint.<br />\n\"The radiators never work,<br />\nand when they get around to fixing them they do it at 7:30 in<br />\nthe morning, when everyone's<br />\nasleep. You might say it's disconcerting.\" At one point, the<br />\nsix boarders resorted to electric<br />\nheaters to warm the place, only<br /><br />\nThe H4U Driving Committee is in many respects<br />\nan anomaly on the Hopkins Campus, neither fish nor<br />\nfowl. The committee obviously does not represent either<br />\nthe Junior Class or the student body as a whole. In fact<br />\nthe H4U Committee simply consists of 27 juniors appointed by Joe Perotto and functions by assuming various responsibilities belonging to other campus organizations. The fact that Perotto continually refers to the<br />\ncommittee as representative of the student body is merely<br />\na confusion which is totally unwarranted. Moreover,<br />\nthe very nature of this committee insures Perotto's complete control.<br />\nIt is admirable that Perotto and 'his' committee<br />\nhave had the drive to initiate some of the programs<br />\nthat they have. However, sheer energy, as such, means<br />\nlittle. Though it cannot be denied that some of the<br />\n114U acomplishments are desirable, it is probable, that<br />\nsome of this work has been harmful or questionable.<br />\nFor example, on what basis can the H4U Committee<br />\nsponsor a dance in the Spring? The committee is not<br />\n11111111111111111<br />\nan official campus organization and as such has no<br />\nbusiness running a dance. Who will be responsible in<br />\nthe event of financial loss? Certainly, not the Junior<br />\nr<br />\nClass, which has not offered to back this dance.<br />\ndonation<br />\n$50<br />\nthe<br />\nwhether<br />\nAlso it can he questioned<br />\nfor a swimming pool could ever be of any practical use.<br />\nThe very size of this sum in contrast with the total<br />\namount needed for such a building (estimated by<br />\nPerotto at $4.5 million) would hamper any fund raising. When a professional fund raiser is looking for<br />\ndonations in the six figure range, $50 is, at most, an<br />\nembarrassment.<br />\nPerotto may have the best intention, but some of Theatre: La Plume de ma Twit.,<br />\nsophisticated French revue,<br />\nhis methods are wrong.

If he feels that the<br />\npersonnel of these organiaztions is at fault, then he has<br />\nthe recourse of electing new and better representatives<br />\nthrough publicity, active support of his candidates, and<br />\nformation of a political party.<br />\nIn the long run Perotto's incessant activity and<br />\npressure can create only harm. At the moment it would<br />\nseem that he is in active, though extralegal, competition<br />\nwith the student government bodies at Hopkins. This<br />\ncompetition can not result in long range benefits, inspite of any initial, dramatic successes it may have. Already Perotto's usurpation of power has led the Student Council to counter by establishing a committee for<br />\nlong range planning of campus projects.<br />\nIt would seem that if Perotto is truly sincere in<br />\nhis avowed desire to better undergraduate life on the<br />\nHomewood campus, his first and necessary step would<br />\nbe to abandon his committee and channel his energies<br />\ninto the proper organizations.<br /><br />\nREMSE N<br />\nHALL<br /><br />\no/<br /><br />\nr-r-<br /><br />\nHOME<br /><br />\nswee'r<br />\nmonE<br /><br />\n4111111<br /><br />\nNEM..<br /><br />\nititil1similim11ii111111111111111111ilMi1<br /><br />\nY.<br /><br />\n,<br />\netlftAV':;46.0<br /><br />\nto be the victims of a blown fuse Morris Reagan, Aaron Su,.
