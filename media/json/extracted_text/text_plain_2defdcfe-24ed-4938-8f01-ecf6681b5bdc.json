There is something about the appearance<br />\nof a Winston\\ Churchill (MIT Commemoration exercises last<br />\nspring) or even a Harry Teuman (California graduation ceremonies last summer) that adds a note pf prestige to the host and<br />\na definite feeling of pride to the students concerned.<br />\nWhile it is obviously impossible to lure the Trurnans and<br />\nChurchills to college campuses very-often, there is a definite value<br />\nin having top men in similarly important fields speak. The psychological value is that it provides the student witt the,enviable feeling of belonging to an institution that can stimIlate the attention<br />\nof important national and international figures. Wein the intellectual standpoint it presents a definite stimulus, a 'bit of living<br />\nhistory for students to experience and incorporate into their normal textbook view of life.<br />\nAt Hopkins the need is no less apparent than it is at any,other<br />\nhigh-ranking college and yet there has been a definite lack of<br />\nsneakers of genehl note who haA;e been called upon to address and<br />\nassembly of student in the last two years.<br />\nSearching the records we find that one of the few speakers of<br />\npolitical eminence, if somewhat controversial worth, to grace the<br />\nHopkins Campus in recent years was Henry Wallace in 1948,<br />\nand even he halted at the edge of 33rd street. In the intellectual<br />\nline (if you wish to distinguish the two) Historian Arnold Toynbee 'stands again as one of.the few great and noted minds which<br />\nhave penertated to the Hopkins assembly halls.' While many may<br />\nrecall the Great Critics Symposium with Tate', Blackmur, and<br />\nCroce, they may also remember that the lectures -were aimed- at<br />\na post-graduate mind and that the topies concerned were hardly<br />\nthe type to appeal to the general underclassrnen.<br />\nThere have also been several important speakers called upon<br />\nto address undergraduate, clubs, but these meeting's,are too often<br />\nrestricted to members of the group concerned. This of course<br />\nbrings to mind the University policy 'on controversial political<br />\nspeakers which dictates that if g definite undergraduate gram<br />\n.feels like inviting such a speaker they may do so, but the meetings<br />\nmust be restricted to members of the club.<br />\nThe tendency hei4 is to push the responsibility for inviting<br />\nimporatht speakers to the shoulders of the activities organizations.<br />\nand too often small budgets prevent the organizations from inviting desired speakers. The IlfC, which ha,s frequently complained<br />\nof lack of student interest in the programs it has presented, has<br />\nonly begun to realize that it must present well known as well as<br />\nworthwhile speakers on their programs if it is to inspire a significant attendance.<br />\nThe other definite group which shares the rtSponsibaity for<br />\nproving these speakers is the Assembly Committee and y'et even<br />\nthis group lacks the funds necessary to encourage something More<br />\nthan important local speakers to appear: When we search last<br />\nyear's assembly Program we find that' Robert Frost .arid William<br />\nVandercook stand as' the only. nationally 'known personalities to<br />\nOnce the,HomeWood assembly niatfotins.<br />\nIt remains for tile administration and the student activities<br />\nciineerned to provide a wider range of important speakers.

He explained that \"Heidellorg gives nothing but advanced<br />\ndegrees, including the Ph.D. and<br />\nthe professional degrees.\" In point<br />\nof learning, the German student,<br />\nwhose average age today is 25,<br />\nranks below our graduate students and above our undergraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nDr. Anderson went to Europe<br />\nexpecting to teach about 30 students in his lecture course and no<br />\nmore than. 12 in the seminar.<br />\nUpon his arrival, he found that<br />\nover 300 were enrolled in the<br />\nlecture course whereas 75 had<br />\nsigned up for the seminar.<br />\nIs Personable Scholar<br />\nThe personable Hopkins scholar<br />\nfinally managed to cut the seminar down to approximately 50<br />\nstudents by giving an era) exam<br />\nto each applicant in order to determine his proficiency in the<br />\nEnglish language.<br />\n\"I taught exclusively in English,\" Dr. Anderson continued.<br />\n\"Their ability with the English<br />\nlanguage was most remarkable.<br />\nThey were able not only to speak<br />\nEnglish but, what is more important, they were able to think<br />\nin it.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCites Book Problem<br />\nWith a smile the American<br />\nLiterature authority recalled, \"In<br />\n<br />\nF-77<br />\n)<br />\n4er<br />\n<br />\nsoosss.....1<br />\n<br />\n'' \"`'<br />\n4<br />\n.'<br />\n7\u2018'' -)<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nk OM BER,<br />\n%eel-, \".i. 13 \u20ac-TrE--R,<br />\n<br />\nc-,(--c- oor ./ ''\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSc<br />\nDr.<br />\n<br />\nTO<br />\n<br />\n6o7- ro<br />\n.45 i.E , 55Y Pt CrVRE<br />\n<br />\ned<br />\n<br />\n(Tuve;<br />\n.vt-tis<br />\n<br />\n(woe)<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\n?<br />\n<br />\nro<br />\n<br />\nfrom.<br />\nex.<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nabroad,<br />\nplaiined<br />\n<br />\nC4.1'-<br />\n<br />\n131811<br />\n<br />\n501101 as<br />\n<br />\nhe<br />\n<br />\nSOW<br />\n<br />\nbe<br />\n<br />\nIs'<br />\nha<br />\n<br />\nait<br />\n<br />\nDO<br />\n<br />\nwhile<br />\n<br />\nteach-<br />\n<br />\ning in Heide!,<br />\n<br />\nthi<br />\n<br />\nberg.<br />\n<br />\nLa<br />\nho.<br />\nSc<br />\n<br />\ntu<br />\nOtt<br />\n<br />\nen'<br />\nstr<br />\nmy lecture course, I would try a<br />\nfew of the typical professor's<br />\njokes, and sif they laughed in the<br />\nright places, I knew that they<br />\nunderstood me.\"<br />\nThe greatest handicap that Dr.<br />\nAnderson had to overcome was<br />\nthe problem of books.

In the intellectual<br />\nline (if you wish to distinguish the two) Historian Arnold Toynbee 'stands again as one of.the few great and noted minds which<br />\nhave penertated to the Hopkins assembly halls.'
