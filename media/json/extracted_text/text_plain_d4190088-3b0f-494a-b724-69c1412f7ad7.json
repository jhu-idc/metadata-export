Every<br />\ntime a quiz or even an oral recitation is given, the members of<br />\nthe class want to know \"what mark they got.\" If a semi-official<br />\nquestioning of the class takes place, the class immediately wants<br />\nto know whether it \"counts\" or not.<br />\nIt is the most natural thing in the world for a man to want to<br />\nknow how he is progressing in whatever line of endeavor occupies his interests. In the case of so many students, however,<br />\nthere seems to be a desire not only for a knowledge of the progress he is making, but for an expression of that knowledge from<br />\ntime to time in some numerical form.<br />\nThere are a few isolated cases where, it is conceivable, the announcement of marks at regular intervals might be of positive<br />\ngood to the student. Such cases would be courses such as composition courses, where the student is not in a position to judge<br />\nthe caliber of his own work. The very great majority of students, however, know whether their work is good, bad or indifferent without having to compute for themselves an average of half<br />\na dozen 6's, 8's and 7.5's.<br />\nMany of the instructors, particularly the student assistants,<br />\nare as much to blame as the students themselves. The emphasis<br />\nof the importance of weekly or semi-monthly quizzes has the<br />\nunfailing tendency to make the mark not an expression of the<br />\nstudent's progress in the course, but the end itself of the course.<br />\nThe \"evils\" of stressing marks have been enumerated too often<br />\nto warrant repetition. The solution to the growing tendency<br />\nwould be either not to make public marks received for work done<br />\nduring the semester, or else, if ,the instructor feels that the curiosity of his students deserves satisfaction, return all papers at the<br />\nend of the semester.<br />\n<br />\nEXTIRPATING THE COLD<br />\nUsually when a wealthy man or big foundation gives a large<br />\nsum of money for investigation into the causes of a disease; he<br />\npicks a death-dealing plague that has long ravished humankind.<br />\nNot so with the Chemical Foundation, however. Believing that<br />\nin chemistry lie the cures of many.diseases, the Chemical Foundation has appropriated $195,000. to be used at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School by Dr. John J. Abel, for research into the causes<br />\nand remedies for the poor, old, common cold!<br />\nDr. Abel is given five years in which to use the allotted sum.<br />\nBy the end of that time, it is hoped, his efforts may bear fruit.<br />\nIf he succeeds in discovering a cure for that least harmful but<br />\nmost annoying ailment, who knows but that his popularity will<br />\nequal that of Lindbergh! Patent medicine manufacturers have<br />\ntried for years and years to cure the cold; now Science is about<br />\nto make the attempt.

Every<br />\ntime a quiz or even an oral recitation is given, the members of<br />\nthe class want to know \"what mark they got.\" If a semi-official<br />\nquestioning of the class takes place, the class immediately wants<br />\nto know whether it \"counts\" or not.<br />\nIt is the most natural thing in the world for a man to want to<br />\nknow how he is progressing in whatever line of endeavor occupies his interests. In the case of so many students, however,<br />\nthere seems to be a desire not only for a knowledge of the progress he is making, but for an expression of that knowledge from<br />\ntime to time in some numerical form.<br />\nThere are a few isolated cases where, it is conceivable, the announcement of marks at regular intervals might be of positive<br />\ngood to the student. Such cases would be courses such as composition courses, where the student is not in a position to judge<br />\nthe caliber of his own work. The very great majority of students, however, know whether their work is good, bad or indifferent without having to compute for themselves an average of half<br />\na dozen 6's, 8's and 7.5's.<br />\nMany of the instructors, particularly the student assistants,<br />\nare as much to blame as the students themselves. The emphasis<br />\nof the importance of weekly or semi-monthly quizzes has the<br />\nunfailing tendency to make the mark not an expression of the<br />\nstudent's progress in the course, but the end itself of the course.<br />\nThe \"evils\" of stressing marks have been enumerated too often<br />\nto warrant repetition. The solution to the growing tendency<br />\nwould be either not to make public marks received for work done<br />\nduring the semester, or else, if ,the instructor feels that the curiosity of his students deserves satisfaction, return all papers at the<br />\nend of the semester.<br /><br />\nEXTIRPATING THE COLD<br />\nUsually when a wealthy man or big foundation gives a large<br />\nsum of money for investigation into the causes of a disease; he<br />\npicks a death-dealing plague that has long ravished humankind.<br />\nNot so with the Chemical Foundation, however. Believing that<br />\nin chemistry lie the cures of many.diseases, the Chemical Foundation has appropriated $195,000. to be used at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School by Dr. John J.

Any athletic contest with<br />\nMaryland is bound to be a fight<br />\nfrom start to finish, almost regardless of the respective merits of the<br />\nteams. The Old-Liners will be out<br />\nto avenge the defeats in lacrosse<br />\nand football they have suffered at<br />\nthe hands of the Black and Blue<br />\nteam.<br />\nMaryland Very Strong<br />\nThat Maryland has a strong team<br />\nis evidenced by the fact that they<br />\nwon four Southern Conference<br />\ngames in a row, defeating V. P. I.,<br />\nV. M. I., and Washington and Lee,<br />\nthe latter team meeting two reverses<br />\nat the hands of the Ravens. This<br />\nweek they have had an intensive<br />\nschedule, meeting Gallaudet, Kentucky University and Hopkins on<br />\nsuccessive nights.<br />\nThe team which meets Hopkins<br />\ntonight is an exceptionally strong<br />\none. Radice, a sophomore, will be<br />\nwatched with especial care. Last<br />\nyear he was the ace of the freshman team and this year, so far, he<br />\nis high point scorer. Fred Linkous,<br />\nwho, incidentally, is captain of the<br />\nTerrapins, has not been starting the<br />\ngames this year, but has been kept<br />\non the bench as reserve, along with<br />\nMadigan, Zahn and Hedzel, who<br />\nusually break into the line-up some<br />\ntime during every game. Adams<br />\nand Heagy are the two regulars of<br />\nlast year's team who will start<br />\nagainst the Jay quint. . It is probA. H.
