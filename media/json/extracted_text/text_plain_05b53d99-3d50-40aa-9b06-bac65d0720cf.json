Now<br />\nthat he has been enlightened upon the subject, we hope that neither he nor any of the other underclassmen will break this Unwritten Law.

Those<br />\nof the University who have had the opportunity of taking a course under Dr. Andrews know<br />\nwhat a pleasure his lectures are. His ability as a lecturer is widely known, and a series of lectures delivered by him upon any subject he might select would meet with instantaneous response by the public. We have been selfish enough in the past to keep Dr. Andrews' lectures<br />\nall to ourselves, and to the few adventurous spirits who may happen to drop in among the students, but now there is a broader field, and we can only hope that Dr. Andrews will see his<br />\nway clear to respond to the request of the Senior Class with a series of public lectures.<br />\nnr\u2014O-Iv vg-r<br />\n\u201e,,,,. zlir vvyvylir .<br />\n<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n<br />\n'\u2022 IF<br />\nVIF<br />\n<br />\ny<br />\ny 4,.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nAs announced a month ago, TIIE NEWS-LETTER Board has decided to award a prize for<br />\nthe best design for a new cover for the paper.

Hughes, 'oS, who, since graduation, has been studying at Munich, wrote the<br />\nfollowing letter to his parents, little thinking<br />\nthat it would ever be published in the NEWSLETTER. A member of the University, however, was present when it was received, and<br />\nrequested that he be allowed to publish it in<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDEAR FOLKS:<br />\nThe University is now in full swing. I have<br />\njust come from paying my 68M. tuition fee,<br />\nand I suppose that is the first step toward<br />\nmaking me a full-fledged student. The work<br />\nis still hard. I mean, to understand the teachers. Many parts of the lectures are now lost<br />\non me, yet I hope that, as I become acquainted<br />\nwith the professors' style of talking and my<br />\nvocabulary grows, this difficulty will be overcome. I decided to give up one of the courses<br />\nI wanted to take. At least, to postpone it until<br />\nnext semester. You see, everything here goes<br />\nby semesters. The University closes about<br />\nMarch 15 for a month. All the courses end<br />\nthen. When they are resumed again in April,<br />\nit is as if the University were starting anew.<br />\nThe German student never stays at one university for his four years' work. He goes to<br />\nat least four different ones. Here a semester,<br />\nthere a semester, usually remaining four terms<br />\nat that university from which he wishes his degree. There are no examinations\u2014you simply<br />\nstudy for four years, and at the end of that<br />\nPeriod take a final examination, which, if<br />\npassed, makes you a doctor of medicine, or<br />\nwhatever other branch you may have passed.<br />\nAs it is, I have 17 hours of lectures, three each<br />\nday and two on Saturday. The course I<br />\ndropped was an excellent one, given by one of<br />\nthe foremost men in Germany, Dr. Brentano.<br />\nThe courses I am taking will, I believe, prepare me in German for the real work next<br />\nyear. As I have to do my reading with a dictionary, it goes slowly, especially as the subjects contain many words one never meets in<br />\nordinary reading.<br />\nThe praiseworthy characteristic of the University, and of all German universities, in fact,<br />\nis that the student is not placed under an instructor with little experience in teaching. The<br />\nmen here are, as a general rule, old men. Each<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nman has made a name for himself by his research work, his works published and his record at the university from which he was called<br />\nto fill the chair at Munich. The man who<br />\ngives the general world history is private advisor to the Prince Regent of Bavaria. One<br />\nof George's (George Abel, 'o8) professors is<br />\nthe most celebrated man in the world in physics, Dr. Roentgen. And so it goes, each man<br />\na \"star,\" an authority in himself, whose books<br />\nare well known in university circles. That<br />\nseems to be the road to fame--the publication<br />\nof books.<br />\nAs forlorn and dreary looking as is the old<br />\npart of the University, just so wonderfully<br />\nbeautiful is the new. I really seem to be wandering in a palace in fairy land, when I recollect it is only a university, and not a kingly<br />\npalace. The halls are immense and wide, with<br />\nmosaic floors. The staircases and doorways<br />\nare of beautiful Circassian marble. Over all<br />\nare exquisite mosaics, beautiful fountains and<br />\nelectric light brackets of beaten iron. At the<br />\nbottom of the main staircase is an immense<br />\nopen space, softly lighted from the dome<br />\nabove. The main hall seats 1,200 people. It<br />\nis in brown and white, with a wonderful skylight of stained glass and heavy mahogany<br />\ndoor with a gold pattern. In the class rooms<br />\nare hardwood floors, soft cream-colored curtains with green borders, and one sees everywhere in the corridors and rooms excellent<br />\ntaste in the selection of the furnishings. The<br />\ndoors are of frosted glass with wood pattern.<br />\nThey have any number of rooms seating 200,<br />\nthe seats being arranged as in a theatre. Never<br />\ndid I imagine a university could be so lavishly<br />\nbuilt.<br />\n(To be continued.)<br />\n<br />\nSAMMY'S \"SCOOP.\"<br />\ncraziest looking little chap in<br />\nthe<br />\nwas<br />\nHe<br />\nthe world; pug-nosed, red-headed, freckledface, and about as big as a minute, when he<br />\ngot his job as night-boy on the Daily Blab.<br />\nHe was, however, always cheerful and willing, and his funny little face wore \"a smile<br />\nthat won't come off.\" His queer looks, droll<br />\nsayings and everlasting good nature made him<br />\na prime favorite and we all forgot how \"unbeautiful\" he was. Before he had been in<br />\n<br />\nthe office a week he wormed his way into<br />\neveryone's heart from old \"Pop Fitch,\" the<br />\nManaging Editor, down to the telegraph<br />\noperators. He was an encyclopedia of crime<br />\nand sport and the boys soon learned to use<br />\nhim as a reference book on these subjects. He<br />\ncould tell you as much about any murderer or<br />\nconfidence game, baseball player or racehorse as you would find in an hour's hunt<br />\nanywhere else. He had a vocabulary of<br />\noriginal and selected slang that would turn<br />\nBilly Baxter in his grave and drive \"The<br />\nChorus Lady\" to drink, could they have<br />\nheard him. Each day the Giants were \"at<br />\nhome\" he would be there, for working at<br />\nnight gave him the afternoons free unless he<br />\nslept, but sleep with ball game on. His<br />\nquaint descriptions of plays that won and lost<br />\ngames up at the Polo Grounds, his scalding<br />\ncriticisms of the players, his slangy similies<br />\ncrept into the Blab so often that the paper be-<br />\n<br />\ncame famous for its -basball news and Alf<br />\nMacy, who was doing that stuff those days,<br />\nwon a reputation as a wit.<br />\nFor three years Sammy worked in the<br />\neditorial rooms, carrying copy, going out for<br />\nthe men's midnight lunches, and doing other<br />\nodd jobs. Then there happened one of those<br />\nunexpected things, which are always bobbing<br />\nup in a newspaper office and which make<br />\njournalism the most fascinating game in the<br />\nworld. The Typographical Union gave a<br />\npicnic and that evening only about half our<br />\npressmen and stereotypers reported; the rest<br />\nwere recovering from the entertainment. The<br />\nforeman of the press-room found his force so<br />\nshort that unless he could get a couple of men<br />\nsomewhere he would not be able to run the<br />\npresses. He went up to the composing-room,<br />\nbut there they needed all their men on the<br />\nlinotype machines. Then he came to the<br />\neditorial-rooms.<br />\n\"There's Sammy. Will he do?\" was the<br />\nanswer he received.<br />\n\"He'll do,\" said the foreman and so Sammy<br />\nwent down stairs for the first time,<br />\nThe three years Sammy had worked for The<br />\nBlab had made a great change in the boy. In<br />\nspite of the hard night hours he had grown<br />\nlike a weed, and if he was not handsome\u2014<br />\nwell you could look at him without laughing:<br />\na metamorphosis that was little short of a<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nmiracle.

The dramuch talking when it was announced that he matic instinct was strong in this little redwas to stay down stairs, and some of us even headed chap, and he knew that the more senwent down to the press room to try to per- sational his rescue, the greater his reward.<br />\nsuade him to return. He only laughed and Finally he hit upon a scheme that was both<br />\nsaid he was going to try it for a while.<br />\nsure of success and dramatic enough for his<br />\nHe tried it and liked it and stayed in the morbid tastes. He had heard that the union<br />\npress room. By dint of hard labor he worked had played the striking stereotypers false and<br />\nhis way from 'fly boy\" to assistant pressman, that they had been around to the office asking<br />\nand what he did not know about a press was to be taken back. This was the inspiration<br />\nnot worth knowing. The same qualities of Sammy's plan. When he got home he<br />\nwhich made him so popular with editors and left a note on the kitchen table asking his<br />\nreporters stood him in good stead among the mother to call him at noon and went off to<br />\nbig ink-stained pressmen. Moreover his capa- bed to sleep, as if strikes were the last thing<br />\nbility for hard work, which had never been in the world. All the afternoon he intertested upstairs, now began to show itself, and viewed the old stereotypers. To each he exthis with his natural quickness made him one plained that the new men were going out and<br />\nof the best men on the presses.<br />\ntold them to meet him that night and he<br />\nSuddenly, another of those unexpected would guarantee their jobs.<br />\nthings happened. The Blab was running an<br />\nopen non-union shop, but the union, by<br />\npromises of rewards and new jobs, got the<br />\nstereotypers to join their ranks. Accordingly,<br />\none fine evening not a man of the stereotyping<br />\ndepartment came to work. By a series of<br />\nmake-shifts and unheard of changes the office<br />\nscraped together enough men and one of the<br />\npressmen, who had done some stereotyping,<br />\nshowed them how and we got out a paper, a<br />\nvery rocky paper, and minus two editions, but<br />\nnevertheless a paper. One of the men taken<br />\nfrom the presses to help make the stereotyping<br />\nforce was Sammy, and next day when they<br />\ngot some more stereotypers he again changed<br />\nhis job, for he stayed in that department.<br />\nSammy had been with the stereotypers<br />\nabout a month and learned to \"shave\" and<br />\n\"clean up\" plates, when one day he was<br />\nstanding behind the open door of his locker<br />\nand heard the foreman say to one of his men:<br />\n\"So you don't think it's no use to try<br />\nSammy.\"<br />\n\"Naw,\" answered the other, \"he's strong<br />\nfor the paper, and I'm sure you can't get<br />\nhim to come out with us. If we sound him,<br />\nhe's just wise enough to tumble to the game<br />\n<br />\nThat evening the night door clerk was<br />\nthunderstruck to see Sammy walking at the<br />\nhead of the old stereotyping force. They got<br />\nout the paper, and it was not short a single<br />\ncopy. Sammy had his pay doubled, and he<br />\ndeserved it, as the press-room foreman said,<br />\n\"We couldn't have even gotten out one of<br />\nthose rocky, no-mail edition papers.\"<br />\nAll this was three years ago, and Sammy<br />\nis now foreman of the stereotyping department, and if some day word is passed round<br />\nthe office that there is a new manager of the<br />\nmechanical departments, most of us will be<br />\nwilling to bet pretty high stakes that his<br />\nname is Sammy, or rather, Mr. Samuel<br />\nMorgan.<br />\nH.<br />\n<br />\nAnd thus the humblest of the learned throng<br />\nGains deepest knowledge of this earth of<br />\nours:<br />\nThe pilgrims on the path most lone and long<br />\nShall reach the coolest shade and sweetest<br />\nflowers;<br />\nAnd he who out of weakness is made strong<br />\nHath leagued himself with the eternal<br />\npowers.\u2014REGINALD A.

The dance started promptly at 9,<br />\nand the last dance was whirled away as the 12<br />\no'clock bell rang.<br />\nIn spite of the rain, which had lasted all the<br />\nafternoon up until 8 in the evening, the dance<br />\nwas very well attended. There were about<br />\n75 couples present, and 25 or 30 stags. It was<br />\na great source of satisfaction to the Board of<br />\nGovernors to see so many of the chaperons<br />\npresent. Among these were Dr. and Mrs.<br />\nLorraine Hulburt, Dr. and Mrs. Henry Wood,<br />\nDr. and Mrs. Ronald T. Abercrombie, Dr. and<br />\nMrs. Murray P. Brush, Mrs. Hall Harris, Jr.,<br />\nand Mrs. Paul Haupt. Those there are to be<br />\ncongratulated, and we hope to see more at the<br />\nnext dance, which very likely will be held<br />\nsometime in February.<br />\nThe floor was cleaner than usual, and well<br />\nwaxed, so that green Freshmen could slip, slide<br />\nand bump into sedate upper classmen and professors to their heart's content. The music<br />\nwas divine; \"ravishing,\" as one learned Senior<br />\nexpressed it, and, although the orchestra might<br />\nhave given more encores in the after-supper<br />\ndances, and made them a little longer, the general sentiment is that Emerich and his choice<br />\norchestra could have done no better. The only<br />\nfault to be found with any of the arrangements<br />\nis that the caterer might have made better<br />\narrangements. True that the salad was hot,<br />\nbut the ice-cream was cold\u2014when it was not<br />\non hot plates. Perhaps it would not be unwise<br />\nfor the Board to change caterers and see if another would not be more satisfactory.<br />\nHowever, the general opinion of those who<br />\ncame to see what the dances are like is that<br />\nthey are most assuredly coming to both the<br />\nothers.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS NIGHT.<br />\nHopkins night, which was held at Ford's<br />\nOpera House on December IIth, proved to be<br />\na howling success.

The play itself, \"The Girl<br />\nQuestion,\" was certainly suited to the occasion,<br />\nas it represented a topic that everyone present<br />\nwas deeply interested in, especially those who<br />\ndid not go to \"stay.\"<br />\nFar more interesting, however, was the spirit<br />\nshown, not only by the students, but by the<br />\nalumni.

This year the Sophomore Class<br />\n\u2022<br />\nhas beert holding its meetings in the Trophy Room.

We know of no other organization besides those mentioned<br />\nA 129V\u201e.<br />\nthat has the right to monopolize the Trophy Room. We do not know<br />\nwhether the fault lies with the Senior Class or with the Sophomore Class.

Now<br />\nthat he has been enlightened upon the subject, we hope that neither he nor any of the other underclassmen will break this Unwritten Law.

Those<br />\nof the University who have had the opportunity of taking a course under Dr. Andrews know<br />\nwhat a pleasure his lectures are. His ability as a lecturer is widely known, and a series of lectures delivered by him upon any subject he might select would meet with instantaneous response by the public. We have been selfish enough in the past to keep Dr. Andrews' lectures<br />\nall to ourselves, and to the few adventurous spirits who may happen to drop in among the students, but now there is a broader field, and we can only hope that Dr. Andrews will see his<br />\nway clear to respond to the request of the Senior Class with a series of public lectures.<br />\nnr\u2014O-Iv vg-r<br />\n\u201e,,,,. zlir vvyvylir .<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br /><br />\n'\u2022 IF<br />\nVIF<br /><br />\ny<br />\ny 4,.<br />\n*<br /><br />\nAs announced a month ago, TIIE NEWS-LETTER Board has decided to award a prize for<br />\nthe best design for a new cover for the paper.

A member of the University, however, was present when it was received, and<br />\nrequested that he be allowed to publish it in<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDEAR FOLKS:<br />\nThe University is now in full swing. I have<br />\njust come from paying my 68M. tuition fee,<br />\nand I suppose that is the first step toward<br />\nmaking me a full-fledged student. The work<br />\nis still hard. I mean, to understand the teachers. Many parts of the lectures are now lost<br />\non me, yet I hope that, as I become acquainted<br />\nwith the professors' style of talking and my<br />\nvocabulary grows, this difficulty will be overcome. I decided to give up one of the courses<br />\nI wanted to take. At least, to postpone it until<br />\nnext semester. You see, everything here goes<br />\nby semesters. The University closes about<br />\nMarch 15 for a month. All the courses end<br />\nthen. When they are resumed again in April,<br />\nit is as if the University were starting anew.<br />\nThe German student never stays at one university for his four years' work. He goes to<br />\nat least four different ones. Here a semester,<br />\nthere a semester, usually remaining four terms<br />\nat that university from which he wishes his degree. There are no examinations\u2014you simply<br />\nstudy for four years, and at the end of that<br />\nPeriod take a final examination, which, if<br />\npassed, makes you a doctor of medicine, or<br />\nwhatever other branch you may have passed.<br />\nAs it is, I have 17 hours of lectures, three each<br />\nday and two on Saturday. The course I<br />\ndropped was an excellent one, given by one of<br />\nthe foremost men in Germany, Dr. Brentano.<br />\nThe courses I am taking will, I believe, prepare me in German for the real work next<br />\nyear. As I have to do my reading with a dictionary, it goes slowly, especially as the subjects contain many words one never meets in<br />\nordinary reading.<br />\nThe praiseworthy characteristic of the University, and of all German universities, in fact,<br />\nis that the student is not placed under an instructor with little experience in teaching. The<br />\nmen here are, as a general rule, old men. Each<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nman has made a name for himself by his research work, his works published and his record at the university from which he was called<br />\nto fill the chair at Munich.

One<br />\nof George's (George Abel, 'o8) professors is<br />\nthe most celebrated man in the world in physics, Dr. Roentgen.

That<br />\nseems to be the road to fame--the publication<br />\nof books.<br />\nAs forlorn and dreary looking as is the old<br />\npart of the University, just so wonderfully<br />\nbeautiful is the new. I really seem to be wandering in a palace in fairy land, when I recollect it is only a university, and not a kingly<br />\npalace. The halls are immense and wide, with<br />\nmosaic floors. The staircases and doorways<br />\nare of beautiful Circassian marble. Over all<br />\nare exquisite mosaics, beautiful fountains and<br />\nelectric light brackets of beaten iron. At the<br />\nbottom of the main staircase is an immense<br />\nopen space, softly lighted from the dome<br />\nabove. The main hall seats 1,200 people. It<br />\nis in brown and white, with a wonderful skylight of stained glass and heavy mahogany<br />\ndoor with a gold pattern. In the class rooms<br />\nare hardwood floors, soft cream-colored curtains with green borders, and one sees everywhere in the corridors and rooms excellent<br />\ntaste in the selection of the furnishings. The<br />\ndoors are of frosted glass with wood pattern.<br />\nThey have any number of rooms seating 200,<br />\nthe seats being arranged as in a theatre.

Before he had been in<br /><br />\nthe office a week he wormed his way into<br />\neveryone's heart from old \"Pop Fitch,\" the<br />\nManaging Editor, down to the telegraph<br />\noperators. He was an encyclopedia of crime<br />\nand sport and the boys soon learned to use<br />\nhim as a reference book on these subjects. He<br />\ncould tell you as much about any murderer or<br />\nconfidence game, baseball player or racehorse as you would find in an hour's hunt<br />\nanywhere else. He had a vocabulary of<br />\noriginal and selected slang that would turn<br />\nBilly Baxter in his grave and drive \"The<br />\nChorus Lady\" to drink, could they have<br />\nheard him. Each day the Giants were \"at<br />\nhome\" he would be there, for working at<br />\nnight gave him the afternoons free unless he<br />\nslept, but sleep with ball game on. His<br />\nquaint descriptions of plays that won and lost<br />\ngames up at the Polo Grounds, his scalding<br />\ncriticisms of the players, his slangy similies<br />\ncrept into the Blab so often that the paper be-<br /><br />\ncame famous for its -basball news and Alf<br />\nMacy, who was doing that stuff those days,<br />\nwon a reputation as a wit.<br />\nFor three years Sammy worked in the<br />\neditorial rooms, carrying copy, going out for<br />\nthe men's midnight lunches, and doing other<br />\nodd jobs. Then there happened one of those<br />\nunexpected things, which are always bobbing<br />\nup in a newspaper office and which make<br />\njournalism the most fascinating game in the<br />\nworld. The Typographical Union gave a<br />\npicnic and that evening only about half our<br />\npressmen and stereotypers reported; the rest<br />\nwere recovering from the entertainment. The<br />\nforeman of the press-room found his force so<br />\nshort that unless he could get a couple of men<br />\nsomewhere he would not be able to run the<br />\npresses. He went up to the composing-room,<br />\nbut there they needed all their men on the<br />\nlinotype machines. Then he came to the<br />\neditorial-rooms.<br />\n\"There's Sammy. Will he do?\" was the<br />\nanswer he received.<br />\n\"He'll do,\" said the foreman and so Sammy<br />\nwent down stairs for the first time,<br />\nThe three years Sammy had worked for The<br />\nBlab had made a great change in the boy.

The Blab was running an<br />\nopen non-union shop, but the union, by<br />\npromises of rewards and new jobs, got the<br />\nstereotypers to join their ranks. Accordingly,<br />\none fine evening not a man of the stereotyping<br />\ndepartment came to work. By a series of<br />\nmake-shifts and unheard of changes the office<br />\nscraped together enough men and one of the<br />\npressmen, who had done some stereotyping,<br />\nshowed them how and we got out a paper, a<br />\nvery rocky paper, and minus two editions, but<br />\nnevertheless a paper. One of the men taken<br />\nfrom the presses to help make the stereotyping<br />\nforce was Sammy, and next day when they<br />\ngot some more stereotypers he again changed<br />\nhis job, for he stayed in that department.<br />\nSammy had been with the stereotypers<br />\nabout a month and learned to \"shave\" and<br />\n\"clean up\" plates, when one day he was<br />\nstanding behind the open door of his locker<br />\nand heard the foreman say to one of his men:<br />\n\"So you don't think it's no use to try<br />\nSammy.\"<br />\n\"Naw,\" answered the other, \"he's strong<br />\nfor the paper, and I'm sure you can't get<br />\nhim to come out with us.

They got<br />\nout the paper, and it was not short a single<br />\ncopy. Sammy had his pay doubled, and he<br />\ndeserved it, as the press-room foreman said,<br />\n\"We couldn't have even gotten out one of<br />\nthose rocky, no-mail edition papers.\"<br />\nAll this was three years ago, and Sammy<br />\nis now foreman of the stereotyping department, and if some day word is passed round<br />\nthe office that there is a new manager of the<br />\nmechanical departments, most of us will be<br />\nwilling to bet pretty high stakes that his<br />\nname is Sammy, or rather, Mr. Samuel<br />\nMorgan.<br />\nH.<br /><br />\nAnd thus the humblest of the learned throng<br />\nGains deepest knowledge of this earth of<br />\nours:<br />\nThe pilgrims on the path most lone and long<br />\nShall reach the coolest shade and sweetest<br />\nflowers;<br />\nAnd he who out of weakness is made strong<br />\nHath leagued himself with the eternal<br />\npowers.\u2014REGINALD A.

Those there are to be<br />\ncongratulated, and we hope to see more at the<br />\nnext dance, which very likely will be held<br />\nsometime in February.<br />\nThe floor was cleaner than usual, and well<br />\nwaxed, so that green Freshmen could slip, slide<br />\nand bump into sedate upper classmen and professors to their heart's content. The music<br />\nwas divine; \"ravishing,\" as one learned Senior<br />\nexpressed it, and, although the orchestra might<br />\nhave given more encores in the after-supper<br />\ndances, and made them a little longer, the general sentiment is that Emerich and his choice<br />\norchestra could have done no better. The only<br />\nfault to be found with any of the arrangements<br />\nis that the caterer might have made better<br />\narrangements. True that the salad was hot,<br />\nbut the ice-cream was cold\u2014when it was not<br />\non hot plates.
