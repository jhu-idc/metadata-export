In addition,<br />\nhe proposed a differential in the<br />\ntuition rates for students at other<br />\ndivisions of the University.<br />\nSpeaking to the Student<br />\nCouncil last Thursday evening,<br />\nfollowing an address to the Board<br />\nof Trustees, Muller made these<br />\nrecommendations in the context<br />\nof a pesimistic report on the<br />\neconomic condition of the<br />\nUniversity. Predicting that<br />\nHopkins will not enjoy financial<br />\nvitality in the forseeable future,<br />\nIvitller cited an inflationary rate<br />\nof six per cent as the essential<br />\ndeterminant of his decision to<br />\nask for increased tuition.<br />\nMoreover, Muller had earlier<br />\nacknowledged that a tuition hike<br />\nis likely for the next several<br />\nyears. The budget and audit<br />\ncommittee, the fiscal branch of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, is<br />\nexpected to approve Muller's<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nproposed tuition rise at its<br />\nOctober 11 meeting.<br />\nMinimum increase<br />\nIn announcing his action,<br />\nMuller asserted, \"I don't know<br />\nhow much in the way of<br />\njustification you want to hear.<br />\nWe know that the inflation rate<br />\nwill not be less than six per cent<br />\nnext year. We will have to<br />\nincrease revenues by six to seven<br />\nper cent. This, I emphasize,is the<br />\nminimum tuition increase I could<br />\ncall for.\" The president seemed<br />\nto imply that further changes in<br />\nthe consumer price index would<br />\nbe accomodated by a<br />\nproportionate increase in student<br />\nfees. The recent financial history<br />\nof Hopkins reveals that such a<br />\npolicy has consistently been<br />\nfollowed. While tuition in current<br />\ndollars (actual dollar amounts)<br />\nhave, as stated, more than<br />\ndoubled, the tuition in constant<br />\n1 967 dollars (the amount of<br />\ndollars, adjusted for inflation)<br />\n<br />\nhas risen a scant 0.9 per cent.<br />\nThe anticipated hike in tuition<br />\nfor undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents enrolled in the<br />\nHomewood Divisions will bring<br />\nthe total fee to $3750, moving<br />\nJohns Hopkins near the top ten<br />\ncolleges and universities in the<br />\nUnited States in terms of total<br />\ncosts. Tuition charges will now<br />\nbe more than double what the<br />\nUniversity charged in 1967<br />\n($1800) and the actual<br />\npercentage increase is well<br />\nabove the five to six percent rate<br />\nof inflation forecasted by<br />\ngovernment economists.<br />\nTuition a hardship<br />\n\"We are aware that the student<br />\nbody at Johns Hopkins is not as<br />\naffluent as students at other<br />\nschools. We are also aware that<br />\nJohns Hopkins aid is less than at<br />\nother schools. We are also aware<br />\nthat the tuition we now charge is<br />\na hardship.

Nothing<br />\ndefinite was decided,so anything<br />\nI might say at this point would<br />\nbe premature.\"<br />\nNevertheless, the<br />\nneighborhood residents showed<br />\ntheir support of the housing<br />\nnegotiations by calling the<br />\nconference. Apparently many<br />\nlandlords prefer to deal with the<br />\n<br />\nschool rather than with students,<br />\nand believe that the university<br />\nwill provide better upkeep for<br />\ntheir property than will<br />\nindividual students.<br />\nBelva Scott, head of The<br />\nOff-Campus Housing Office, said,<br />\n\"There is more trust established<br />\nnow. It was a very positive<br />\nmeeting as far as Charles Village<br />\nis concerned. Personally, I feel<br />\nthat the hostility (toward<br />\nstudents) is exaggerated.\"<br />\nHowever, several problems still<br />\nexist. Scott observed that<br />\n\"whether enough housing is<br />\navailable remains to be seen.\"<br />\nIn addition, the students'<br />\nhousing needs could not be<br />\nadequately assessed because no<br />\nstudent representatives attended<br />\n<br />\nthe meeting, although both Steve<br />\nPonchak and Mark Hertsgaard<br />\nwere invited. Neither could be<br />\nreached for comment.<br />\nWhitman expressed optimism<br />\nthat the University and nearby<br />\nproperty owners can formulate a<br />\nleasing arrangement. He stated,<br />\n\"Everyone seems to be willing to<br />\nwork on it.\"<br />\nThe executive director of the<br />\nGHCC saw a double benefit for a<br />\npossible University-Community<br />\nleasing arrangement. \"First, it<br />\nwould provide students with<br />\nmore housing. Secondly, the<br />\nUniversity would not be<br />\npuschasing apartments and<br />\ndisplacing residents.\" This latter<br />\naction has traditionally aroused<br />\nthe anger of Homewood<br />\nresidents.<br />\n\"The University must develop<br />\nguidelines and preconditions<br />\nbefore leasing,\" Whitman added,<br />\nso that both Hopkins and local<br />\nhomeowners had a clear<br />\nunderstanding of the<br />\nresponsibilities of both parties.<br />\nHousing is one of the problems<br />\nwhich demands the cooperation<br />\nof Hopkins and the community.<br />\nLack of street parking spaces, a<br />\nsource of contention between<br />\nresidents and students for years,<br />\nis one such area of disagreement.<br />\n\"I could tell what time of the<br />\nyear it was by looking out the<br />\nwindow and see if I had a parking<br />\nspace,\" commented Whitman.<br />\n\"Residents are angry about the<br />\ndifficulty they have<br />\nparking\u2014usually because of<br />\nstudent vehicles,\" he added.<br />\n<br />\nMuller : Can I keep the change for my kids?<br />\nthat for students receiving aid we consonance with the general<br />\nwill do everything appropriate to policy of the University to set all<br />\nsee that their burden is not pay increases on an<br />\nincreased by this tuition across-the-board basis.

Once again, the<br />\nElaborating on the tuition<br />\npresident said that no help will<br />\ndifferential to be imposed next<br />\ncome from the Hopkins year, Muller said, \"Tuition for<br />\nH un dreds carnpaign for this<br />\nmedical students will be higher<br />\nfinancial period. \"Almost all of than that paid by students at<br />\nthe larger gifts are deferred.

He graduated from<br />\nthe medical school in 1932, and<br />\nafter an internship and residency<br />\nin New York and Chicago,<br />\nreturned to Baltimore. For the<br />\nlast three years he served as head<br />\nof the health professions<br />\nrecommendations committee, a<br />\nPosition which subjected him to<br />\nboth criticism and acclaim. \"He<br />\nconsidered himself to be an<br />\nadvocate 4the student,\"<br />\nremarks Dr. S: nund Suskind, a<br />\npersonal friei<br />\nand colleague.<br />\n\"He always found merit in his<br />\nadvisees, even if that student was<br />\nnot particularly strong<br />\nacademically,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Of course, he drew fire from<br />\n<br />\nundergraduates at times because<br />\nno one can guarantee admission<br />\nto medical school,\" Suskind said.<br />\nDebuskey saw himself in a very<br />\nhumane role, \"counseling those<br />\nthat were in the application<br />\nprocess as well as those suffering<br />\nthrough rejection notices,\" the<br />\ndean offered. Besides conferring<br />\nwith the deans of medical schools<br />\ntrying to put Hopkins students in<br />\nthe best possible light, Debuskey<br />\ncould also \"guide those students<br />\nwith weaker academic records<br />\ntoward other areas of health<br />\ncare,\" stated Suskind. \"Matt was<br />\na pretty damn good friend as well<br />\nas being a good counselor to alot<br />\nof students at this University,\"<br />\nhe concluded. \"There isn't<br />\nanother person of his stature we<br />\ncould possibly get as health<br />\nprofessions advisor,\" admitted<br />\nthe head of Undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate studies.

Dr. John<br />\nLittlefield, present head of<br />\npediatrics at Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School, commented that<br />\nDebuskey was \"known for his<br />\ngreat compassion as both a<br />\nclinician and teacher.\" The late<br />\npediatrician conducted a referral<br />\nservice for practicing doctors at<br />\nthe Children's Medical and<br />\nSurgical Center, and a yearly<br />\ncourse \"Progress in Pediatrics\"<br />\nwhich highlighted current<br />\ndevelopments in the field.<br />\n<br />\ncategorized as unhealthy;<br />\nstate-backed schools placed more<br />\nthan 80% of their number in the<br />\ntop three groupings\u2014healthy,<br />\nrelatively healthy, and average.<br />\nMoreover, as the size of the<br />\nschool increased, so did its fiscal<br />\nwell-being; thus, large usually<br />\nstate controlled schools have<br />\nnearly four times the<br />\nrepresentation of small, probably<br />\nprivate colleges, in the superior<br />\nratings.

More money and<br />\nresources are currently being<br />\nchanneled into medicine and<br />\nclinical investigation rather than<br />\nbasic scientific studies. \"Do they<br />\n(federal Officials) realize what<br />\nthey do to the universities when<br />\nthey turn the faucet off and on?\"<br />\nremarked Bowie.

Let's<br />\nsee: a $200 rise in charges for 1975, another increase of $300<br />\nfor this year, and now an accompanying hike of $250 for<br />\nnext year, bringing the levies here to $3750. Quite a story.<br />\nThe reasons cited by the University are as familiar in<br />\nnature as in number. This is not the first time that Hopkins<br />\nhas admitted to students that its efforts to increase revenues<br />\nhave failed\u2014to the point where the University is developing<br />\nan alarming reliance on student tuition increases to balance<br />\nits budgets. Students here are quickly developing an<br />\nanimosity towards University fiscal officers. Reaction to<br />\nPresident Muller's Thursday announcement to the student<br />\ncouncil was somewhat less than accomodating: members<br />\nwere both visibly upset at the news and vocally resentful.<br />\nThis year's reason why the tuition must rise once more is<br />\nthat the now-completed Hopkins Hundreds campaign took a<br />\nlot of time and effort. It took so much from the President<br />\nthat he was unable to devote much to the normal pursuit of<br />\nextra funds for Homewood, such as annual giving. Muller<br />\npromises he will try harder next year. Well and good. But<br />\nMuller adds that tuition will, in spite of his renewed emphasis<br />\non fund-raising\u2014continue to rise. Not so good.<br />\nAll will freely admit that the University faces very<br />\ntroubled economic times. The government\u2014both state and<br />\nfederal\u2014continue to regard private, institutions as fat cats,<br />\nduring a time when they are fighting for their financial lives.<br />\nAnd costs are rising, and they will likely continue to do just<br />\nthat.<br />\nBut while it is not clear as to what new avenues of<br />\napproach the University might take to overcome money<br />\nproblems it is clear that a financial posture having<br />\nundergraduates take up the slack in revenue-making efforts<br />\nwill result in harm to the studcntry.

This proves for a<br />\ngreat deal of confusion in<br />\nunderstanding the problem. The<br />\nsame feeling often exists with<br />\ncrime in general, and its<br />\nunderstanding. Put the two<br />\ntogether and you can probably<br />\nrealize just why it is so hard to<br />\nunderstand the crime of rape and<br />\nits impact on our society. It is<br />\n<br />\nin one survey were committed by<br />\nan unknown male. It is a fact<br />\nthat, like criminals in general, the<br />\nrapist will live in the same general<br />\narea as the victim, often on the<br />\nsame street. It is a myth that the<br />\nmajority of.. rapes are racially<br />\nmixed; again it is just the<br />\nopposite.<br />\nWhat is true is that a rape<br />\nvictim often blames herself for<br />\nwhat happened. She views life<br />\nmore harshly than ever before.<br />\nA Victim's Story<br />\nNo, I never reported it.

As a<br />\nmother needlessly blames the<br />\n<br />\nwas<br />\n<br />\nas 'tx-s\u00a3avvt_ cic\u2022si.\u201843, c-lcv<br />\n<br />\nperhaps more than twenty times<br />\nthe reported number may<br />\nactually be occurring. The<br />\nreasons could be the ones<br />\npreviously stated. Often the<br />\nwoman feels that nothing can be<br />\ndone by the police or that she<br />\nfeels<br />\nthe rapist will return<br />\nfor revenge if the act is reported.<br />\nMany people feel that it was<br />\njust chance that they were raped.<br />\nPossibly, but the research shows<br />\nthat many rapes were planned in<br />\nadvance. There is no doubt that<br />\nwomen need help in this area,<br />\n<br />\nof the legal<br />\nAt the pivot<br />\nidea in handling this crime<br />\nnationwide seems to be the<br />\nopinion that there are many false<br />\nrape reports. The<br />\nPresident'sCommission on Crime<br />\nhas reported that some police<br />\ndepartments regularly conclude<br />\nthat as many as 50% of the<br />\ncomplaints received were not<br />\nrapes. In fact, most of the data in<br />\nthis area including criminal law<br />\nadministration articles and books<br />\non the rules of criminal evidence<br />\nwill agree with this line of<br />\n<br />\nthat assistance could be<br />\n<br />\nthinking. This has naturally led<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nptcwicieci, hy the Vta\\t\u2018more<br />\n<br />\nTears of grief<br />\nOrlando Letelier, a high official in the Marxist government<br />\nof the late Chilean President Salvadore Allende, was killed<br />\nTuesday morning in Washington when a bomb exploded<br />\nbeneath his car. Also slain in the terrorist incident was Ronni<br />\nMoffitt, a co-worker riding in the car with him. It is<br />\nunfortunate but true that, to a public hardened by years of<br />\nfighting in Vietnam, massive global hunger and widespread<br />\npolitical repression, this political assasination might be<br />\nregarded as just another news story.<br />\nBut what if you had known Orlando Letelier? What if<br />\nRonni was your sister? What if you knew her and found her<br />\ndead on the ground? How could you run when you know?<br />\nKnowing the victims as friends and co-workers, like one<br />\nNews-Letter staffer did, brings the killings down to a level at<br />\nwhich people can relate to them. But the resultant feelings of<br />\nshock, sorrow and outrage are not enough. We must try to<br />\nunderstand why Orlando Letelier was murdered. Mr. Letelier<br />\nwas imprisoned for one year by the right-wing, Military junta<br />\nafter it overthrew the popularly elected Allende government<br />\nin September of 1973. (Congressional action later revealed<br />\nthat the U.S. government gave active support to the junta's<br />\nefforts.) After international pressure freed him, Letelier came<br />\nto Washington where, among other activities, he was an<br />\noutspoken critic of the repressive political and economic<br />\npolicies of the junta as well as a leader in an increasingly<br />\neffective coalition of exiled opponents to the junta. Early<br />\nthis September his Chilean citizenship was revoked by the<br />\nPinochet dictatorship. He allegedly influenced the Dutch<br />\ngovernment's refusal to underwrite a $63 million investment<br />\ndestined for Chile.<br />\nIn view of the fact that other opponents of the current<br />\nPinochet regime have also been the victims of violence in<br />\nrecent years, it is not difficult to join Richard Barnet, an<br />\nassociate of Letelier, in blaming Tuesday's deaths on the<br />\nChilean junta's secret police. The attack should also be seen<br />\nas but one of the consequences of the U.S. policy of<br />\n\"destabilizing\" the democracy of Chile under Allende.<br />\nThe murders of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt and<br />\nthe circumstances surrounding them must not be passed over<br />\nwithout serious thought and action. Discontinuance of U.S.<br />\npolitical and economic support of the Chilean dictators and<br />\nother similar regimes throughout the world is a good place to<br />\nstart. Beyond that, the consequences of American<br />\nimperialism must be examined, and the morality of it<br />\nMark Hertsgaard<br />\nchallenged.<br />\n<br />\nvise<br />\n<br />\ncif<br />\n<br />\nor<br />\n<br />\nlaw to provide the defendant the<br />\n<br />\ndeserted street near downtown.<br />\n<br />\nA young woman bids the guard<br />\ngoodnight as she leaves her office<br />\nbuilding into the bitter weather<br />\nof January.

But<br />\nsuddenly, a charge of fear rushes<br />\nthrough her body as the cold is<br />\nall but forgotten. Footsteps, loud<br />\nquick footsteps are behind her.<br />\nHer heart thumps wildly and the<br />\npalms of her hands begin to<br />\nsweat as she quickens her pace.<br />\nAlthough trembling, she tells<br />\nherself that she is being foolish.<br />\nShe knows that it happens to<br />\nothers, but not to her, not now.<br />\nIt is now 5:35 a.m. in a small<br />\nhospital room. The victim has<br />\nfinished her series of police and<br />\nmedical interviews. A feeling that<br />\nshe has never known before rules<br />\nher mind. Shame, guilt,<br />\nfrustration and anger all combine<br />\ninto the force that controls her<br />\nemotions and, in fact, her life.<br />\nShe is now a policeman's report<br />\nnumber, a hospital's past history<br />\nand a state's attorney's future<br />\nconcern.

In addition,<br />\nhe proposed a differential in the<br />\ntuition rates for students at other<br />\ndivisions of the University.<br />\nSpeaking to the Student<br />\nCouncil last Thursday evening,<br />\nfollowing an address to the Board<br />\nof Trustees, Muller made these<br />\nrecommendations in the context<br />\nof a pesimistic report on the<br />\neconomic condition of the<br />\nUniversity. Predicting that<br />\nHopkins will not enjoy financial<br />\nvitality in the forseeable future,<br />\nIvitller cited an inflationary rate<br />\nof six per cent as the essential<br />\ndeterminant of his decision to<br />\nask for increased tuition.<br />\nMoreover, Muller had earlier<br />\nacknowledged that a tuition hike<br />\nis likely for the next several<br />\nyears.

We will have to<br />\nincrease revenues by six to seven<br />\nper cent. This, I emphasize,is the<br />\nminimum tuition increase I could<br />\ncall for.\" The president seemed<br />\nto imply that further changes in<br />\nthe consumer price index would<br />\nbe accomodated by a<br />\nproportionate increase in student<br />\nfees. The recent financial history<br />\nof Hopkins reveals that such a<br />\npolicy has consistently been<br />\nfollowed. While tuition in current<br />\ndollars (actual dollar amounts)<br />\nhave, as stated, more than<br />\ndoubled, the tuition in constant<br />\n1 967 dollars (the amount of<br />\ndollars, adjusted for inflation)<br /><br />\nhas risen a scant 0.9 per cent.<br />\nThe anticipated hike in tuition<br />\nfor undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents enrolled in the<br />\nHomewood Divisions will bring<br />\nthe total fee to $3750, moving<br />\nJohns Hopkins near the top ten<br />\ncolleges and universities in the<br />\nUnited States in terms of total<br />\ncosts.

Nothing<br />\ndefinite was decided,so anything<br />\nI might say at this point would<br />\nbe premature.\"<br />\nNevertheless, the<br />\nneighborhood residents showed<br />\ntheir support of the housing<br />\nnegotiations by calling the<br />\nconference. Apparently many<br />\nlandlords prefer to deal with the<br /><br />\nschool rather than with students,<br />\nand believe that the university<br />\nwill provide better upkeep for<br />\ntheir property than will<br />\nindividual students.<br />\nBelva Scott, head of The<br />\nOff-Campus Housing Office, said,<br />\n\"There is more trust established<br />\nnow. It was a very positive<br />\nmeeting as far as Charles Village<br />\nis concerned. Personally, I feel<br />\nthat the hostility (toward<br />\nstudents) is exaggerated.\"<br />\nHowever, several problems still<br />\nexist. Scott observed that<br />\n\"whether enough housing is<br />\navailable remains to be seen.\"<br />\nIn addition, the students'<br />\nhousing needs could not be<br />\nadequately assessed because no<br />\nstudent representatives attended<br /><br />\nthe meeting, although both Steve<br />\nPonchak and Mark Hertsgaard<br />\nwere invited. Neither could be<br />\nreached for comment.<br />\nWhitman expressed optimism<br />\nthat the University and nearby<br />\nproperty owners can formulate a<br />\nleasing arrangement. He stated,<br />\n\"Everyone seems to be willing to<br />\nwork on it.\"<br />\nThe executive director of the<br />\nGHCC saw a double benefit for a<br />\npossible University-Community<br />\nleasing arrangement. \"First, it<br />\nwould provide students with<br />\nmore housing. Secondly, the<br />\nUniversity would not be<br />\npuschasing apartments and<br />\ndisplacing residents.\" This latter<br />\naction has traditionally aroused<br />\nthe anger of Homewood<br />\nresidents.<br />\n\"The University must develop<br />\nguidelines and preconditions<br />\nbefore leasing,\" Whitman added,<br />\nso that both Hopkins and local<br />\nhomeowners had a clear<br />\nunderstanding of the<br />\nresponsibilities of both parties.<br />\nHousing is one of the problems<br />\nwhich demands the cooperation<br />\nof Hopkins and the community.<br />\nLack of street parking spaces, a<br />\nsource of contention between<br />\nresidents and students for years,<br />\nis one such area of disagreement.<br />\n\"I could tell what time of the<br />\nyear it was by looking out the<br />\nwindow and see if I had a parking<br />\nspace,\" commented Whitman.<br />\n\"Residents are angry about the<br />\ndifficulty they have<br />\nparking\u2014usually because of<br />\nstudent vehicles,\" he added.<br /><br />\nMuller : Can I keep the change for my kids?<br />\nthat for students receiving aid we consonance with the general<br />\nwill do everything appropriate to policy of the University to set all<br />\nsee that their burden is not pay increases on an<br />\nincreased by this tuition across-the-board basis.

He graduated from<br />\nthe medical school in 1932, and<br />\nafter an internship and residency<br />\nin New York and Chicago,<br />\nreturned to Baltimore. For the<br />\nlast three years he served as head<br />\nof the health professions<br />\nrecommendations committee, a<br />\nPosition which subjected him to<br />\nboth criticism and acclaim. \"He<br />\nconsidered himself to be an<br />\nadvocate 4the student,\"<br />\nremarks Dr. S: nund Suskind, a<br />\npersonal friei<br />\nand colleague.<br />\n\"He always found merit in his<br />\nadvisees, even if that student was<br />\nnot particularly strong<br />\nacademically,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Of course, he drew fire from<br /><br />\nundergraduates at times because<br />\nno one can guarantee admission<br />\nto medical school,\" Suskind said.<br />\nDebuskey saw himself in a very<br />\nhumane role, \"counseling those<br />\nthat were in the application<br />\nprocess as well as those suffering<br />\nthrough rejection notices,\" the<br />\ndean offered. Besides conferring<br />\nwith the deans of medical schools<br />\ntrying to put Hopkins students in<br />\nthe best possible light, Debuskey<br />\ncould also \"guide those students<br />\nwith weaker academic records<br />\ntoward other areas of health<br />\ncare,\" stated Suskind. \"Matt was<br />\na pretty damn good friend as well<br />\nas being a good counselor to alot<br />\nof students at this University,\"<br />\nhe concluded. \"There isn't<br />\nanother person of his stature we<br />\ncould possibly get as health<br />\nprofessions advisor,\" admitted<br />\nthe head of Undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate studies. Debuskey's<br />\nrange of contacts and personal<br />\nfriendships with medical leaders<br />\nwas of great benefit to<br />\npre-medical students, giving them<br />\nsources of information<br />\nunavailable to students at other<br />\nuniversities.<br />\n\"We can't replace him. .<br />\n.never,\" continued Suskind. A<br /><br />\nman of personal warmth and<br />\ncharm as well as a brilliant<br />\nphysician, Debuskey had a gift<br />\nfor comforting those with<br />\nproblems. \"Maybe it's the type<br />\nof training,\" sighed Suskind,<br />\n\"but we just aren't getting people<br />\nlike Dr. Debuskey into medicine<br />\nanymore.\"<br />\nKennedy Institute<br />\nDebuskey had a special<br />\ninterest in retardation and the<br />\n.nental health of children and<br />\nidolescents and had previously<br />\nheaded the Kennedy Institute for<br />\nHandicapped Children. He<br />\nfounded the Children's Guild and<br />\nwas on the boards of several local<br />\norganizations dedicated to<br />\nmental health. Dr. John<br />\nLittlefield, present head of<br />\npediatrics at Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School, commented that<br />\nDebuskey was \"known for his<br />\ngreat compassion as both a<br />\nclinician and teacher.\" The late<br />\npediatrician conducted a referral<br />\nservice for practicing doctors at<br />\nthe Children's Medical and<br />\nSurgical Center, and a yearly<br />\ncourse \"Progress in Pediatrics\"<br />\nwhich highlighted current<br />\ndevelopments in the field.<br /><br />\ncategorized as unhealthy;<br />\nstate-backed schools placed more<br />\nthan 80% of their number in the<br />\ntop three groupings\u2014healthy,<br />\nrelatively healthy, and average.<br />\nMoreover, as the size of the<br />\nschool increased, so did its fiscal<br />\nwell-being; thus, large usually<br />\nstate controlled schools have<br />\nnearly four times the<br />\nrepresentation of small, probably<br />\nprivate colleges, in the superior<br />\nratings.

Bowie articulated the<br />\nUniversity's continued reliance<br />\non private contributions by<br />\nstating \"one major reason a<br />\nbiology structure will be built is<br />\nbecause raising money for that<br />\nparticular venture was easiest at<br />\nthis time,in Steve's opinion.\"<br />\nBowie is concerned too, about<br />\nthe sporadic flow of federal<br />\ngrants to support research in the<br />\nhard sciences. \"Losses in<br />\ngovernment money is not only<br />\nregrettable in its own right but<br />\nremoves incentives for graduate<br />\nstudents in those departments to<br />\nattend Hopkins,\" Bowie<br />\ncommented. More money and<br />\nresources are currently being<br />\nchanneled into medicine and<br />\nclinical investigation rather than<br />\nbasic scientific studies. \"Do they<br />\n(federal Officials) realize what<br />\nthey do to the universities when<br />\nthey turn the faucet off and on?\"<br />\nremarked Bowie. He suggested<br />\nthat Washington maintain a basic<br />\nresearch capability in all the<br />\nsciences rather than flood an<br />\ninstitution with money for a<br />\nsingle project.<br />\nFinally, the vice-president is<br />\nworried about the growing gap<br />\nbetween tuition at public and<br />\nnon-public schools, lest applicant<br />\npool of private colleges shrink<br />\nnumerically and diminish in<br />\nquality. \"Our pool has increased<br />\nand most private universities<br />\napplicants pools are holding<br />\nstrong,\" contended the<br />\nexecutive. However, if tuition<br />\ninflation continues at its present<br />\nrate, Bowie admits that private<br />\nschools will be hard pressed to<br />\ncapture a significant share of the<br />\nundergraduate market.<br /><br />\nTIM<br /><br />\nNEVIIS4ETTER<br /><br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nfeatures editors<br />\nnews editor<br />\nsports editor<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\ngraphics editor<br />\ncontributing editor<br /><br />\nBob Buchanan,Stephen Levitz<br />\nCarole Jaffe, Vanessa Evan<br />\nDavid Hawk<br />\nEric Garlatzd,D.H.

Let's<br />\nsee: a $200 rise in charges for 1975, another increase of $300<br />\nfor this year, and now an accompanying hike of $250 for<br />\nnext year, bringing the levies here to $3750. Quite a story.<br />\nThe reasons cited by the University are as familiar in<br />\nnature as in number. This is not the first time that Hopkins<br />\nhas admitted to students that its efforts to increase revenues<br />\nhave failed\u2014to the point where the University is developing<br />\nan alarming reliance on student tuition increases to balance<br />\nits budgets. Students here are quickly developing an<br />\nanimosity towards University fiscal officers. Reaction to<br />\nPresident Muller's Thursday announcement to the student<br />\ncouncil was somewhat less than accomodating: members<br />\nwere both visibly upset at the news and vocally resentful.<br />\nThis year's reason why the tuition must rise once more is<br />\nthat the now-completed Hopkins Hundreds campaign took a<br />\nlot of time and effort. It took so much from the President<br />\nthat he was unable to devote much to the normal pursuit of<br />\nextra funds for Homewood, such as annual giving. Muller<br />\npromises he will try harder next year. Well and good. But<br />\nMuller adds that tuition will, in spite of his renewed emphasis<br />\non fund-raising\u2014continue to rise. Not so good.<br />\nAll will freely admit that the University faces very<br />\ntroubled economic times. The government\u2014both state and<br />\nfederal\u2014continue to regard private, institutions as fat cats,<br />\nduring a time when they are fighting for their financial lives.<br />\nAnd costs are rising, and they will likely continue to do just<br />\nthat.<br />\nBut while it is not clear as to what new avenues of<br />\napproach the University might take to overcome money<br />\nproblems it is clear that a financial posture having<br />\nundergraduates take up the slack in revenue-making efforts<br />\nwill result in harm to the studcntry.

This proves for a<br />\ngreat deal of confusion in<br />\nunderstanding the problem. The<br />\nsame feeling often exists with<br />\ncrime in general, and its<br />\nunderstanding. Put the two<br />\ntogether and you can probably<br />\nrealize just why it is so hard to<br />\nunderstand the crime of rape and<br />\nits impact on our society. It is<br /><br />\nin one survey were committed by<br />\nan unknown male. It is a fact<br />\nthat, like criminals in general, the<br />\nrapist will live in the same general<br />\narea as the victim, often on the<br />\nsame street. It is a myth that the<br />\nmajority of.. rapes are racially<br />\nmixed; again it is just the<br />\nopposite.<br />\nWhat is true is that a rape<br />\nvictim often blames herself for<br />\nwhat happened. She views life<br />\nmore harshly than ever before.<br />\nA Victim's Story<br />\nNo, I never reported it.

As a<br />\nmother needlessly blames the<br /><br />\nwas<br /><br />\nas 'tx-s\u00a3avvt_ cic\u2022si.\u201843, c-lcv<br /><br />\nperhaps more than twenty times<br />\nthe reported number may<br />\nactually be occurring. The<br />\nreasons could be the ones<br />\npreviously stated. Often the<br />\nwoman feels that nothing can be<br />\ndone by the police or that she<br />\nfeels<br />\nthe rapist will return<br />\nfor revenge if the act is reported.<br />\nMany people feel that it was<br />\njust chance that they were raped.<br />\nPossibly, but the research shows<br />\nthat many rapes were planned in<br />\nadvance. There is no doubt that<br />\nwomen need help in this area,<br /><br />\nof the legal<br />\nAt the pivot<br />\nidea in handling this crime<br />\nnationwide seems to be the<br />\nopinion that there are many false<br />\nrape reports. The<br />\nPresident'sCommission on Crime<br />\nhas reported that some police<br />\ndepartments regularly conclude<br />\nthat as many as 50% of the<br />\ncomplaints received were not<br />\nrapes. In fact, most of the data in<br />\nthis area including criminal law<br />\nadministration articles and books<br />\non the rules of criminal evidence<br />\nwill agree with this line of<br /><br />\nthat assistance could be<br /><br />\nthinking. This has naturally led<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nptcwicieci, hy the Vta\\t\u2018more<br /><br />\nTears of grief<br />\nOrlando Letelier, a high official in the Marxist government<br />\nof the late Chilean President Salvadore Allende, was killed<br />\nTuesday morning in Washington when a bomb exploded<br />\nbeneath his car. Also slain in the terrorist incident was Ronni<br />\nMoffitt, a co-worker riding in the car with him. It is<br />\nunfortunate but true that, to a public hardened by years of<br />\nfighting in Vietnam, massive global hunger and widespread<br />\npolitical repression, this political assasination might be<br />\nregarded as just another news story.<br />\nBut what if you had known Orlando Letelier? What if<br />\nRonni was your sister? What if you knew her and found her<br />\ndead on the ground? How could you run when you know?<br />\nKnowing the victims as friends and co-workers, like one<br />\nNews-Letter staffer did, brings the killings down to a level at<br />\nwhich people can relate to them. But the resultant feelings of<br />\nshock, sorrow and outrage are not enough. We must try to<br />\nunderstand why Orlando Letelier was murdered. Mr. Letelier<br />\nwas imprisoned for one year by the right-wing, Military junta<br />\nafter it overthrew the popularly elected Allende government<br />\nin September of 1973. (Congressional action later revealed<br />\nthat the U.S. government gave active support to the junta's<br />\nefforts.) After international pressure freed him, Letelier came<br />\nto Washington where, among other activities, he was an<br />\noutspoken critic of the repressive political and economic<br />\npolicies of the junta as well as a leader in an increasingly<br />\neffective coalition of exiled opponents to the junta. Early<br />\nthis September his Chilean citizenship was revoked by the<br />\nPinochet dictatorship. He allegedly influenced the Dutch<br />\ngovernment's refusal to underwrite a $63 million investment<br />\ndestined for Chile.<br />\nIn view of the fact that other opponents of the current<br />\nPinochet regime have also been the victims of violence in<br />\nrecent years, it is not difficult to join Richard Barnet, an<br />\nassociate of Letelier, in blaming Tuesday's deaths on the<br />\nChilean junta's secret police. The attack should also be seen<br />\nas but one of the consequences of the U.S. policy of<br />\n\"destabilizing\" the democracy of Chile under Allende.<br />\nThe murders of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt and<br />\nthe circumstances surrounding them must not be passed over<br />\nwithout serious thought and action. Discontinuance of U.S.<br />\npolitical and economic support of the Chilean dictators and<br />\nother similar regimes throughout the world is a good place to<br />\nstart.

An alley provides a<br />\nshort-cut to the garage.<br />\nOrdinarily she wouldn't risk such<br />\na passage but it is cold, very cold,<br />\nand she wants to start her trip<br />\nhome as soon as possible.<br />\nTurning into the alley she notices<br />\nthat her footsteps echo off the<br />\nsides of nearby buildings. But<br />\nsuddenly, a charge of fear rushes<br />\nthrough her body as the cold is<br />\nall but forgotten.

This is to say that not<br />\nonly must the woman be careful<br />\nand aware when she is on the<br />\nstreet but that she must give just<br />\nas much consideration to the<br />\ncompany she keeps and whom<br />\nshe invites into her home.<br />\nBoyfriends, family and neighbors<br />\nare often involved in rape cases.<br />\nAlways remember that virtually<br />\nany male at any time could be<br />\nyour rapist.
