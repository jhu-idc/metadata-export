In addition to the observance of the date of the birth of the institution, the<br />\noccasion marked the formal opening of the new School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic Health.<br />\nUnfortunately, President Goodnow was unable to preside over<br />\nthe exercises, on account of a temporary indisposition, and Dr. William<br />\nH. Welch was requested to take his place. As Dr. Welch had been especially interested in the School of Hygiene and Public Health it was<br />\nvery fitting that he should be able to introduce, as the orator of the<br />\nday, Dr. George E. Vincent, president of the Rockefeller Foundation.<br />\nIt will be remembered that large contributions were made by this<br />\nfamous institution for the founding of the new department of the<br />\nMedical School.<br />\nDr. Welch and Dr. Vincent headed the academic procession, which<br />\ncame slowly into the hall at 11 o'clock. Following them were the<br />\ntrustees, the faculty in caps and gowns, the alumni, headed by Dr.<br />\nG. L. Radcliffe, the students of the Graduate and Medical Departments, and, finally, the undergraduate body, led by Dr. Abercrombie.<br />\nAfter the invocation by Rev. Edward H. Griffin, former dean of<br />\nthe University faculty, Dr. Welch introduced Dr. Vincent, who delivered a highly interesting address, appropriate to the opening of the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health.<br />\nHis address was followed by the presentation of a portrait of Professor John J. Abel, after a brief sketch of his valuable research work<br />\nby Mr. Griffith B. Coale. The gift was accepted by Dr. Welch, who<br />\nthen read the address of Dr. Goodnow. He took occasion to mention<br />\nthe fact that Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, who was recently<br />\nelected to the Board of Trustees, was among the assembled dignitaries.<br />\nThe President's announcements<br />\nincluded a short account of the<br />\nacademic responsibilities thrown<br />\non American universities as a result of the war. \"The present is<br />\nthe time of triumph of American<br />\npeople and American ideals.\" It<br />\nis our duty and privilege, therefore, to uphold the standard of<br />\ntruth and spread it to the ultimate<br />\nbetterment, not only of this nation, but to the world. He told<br />\nhow European seats of learning<br />\nwere temporarily broken up, and<br />\nthat'we must administer to many<br />\nforeign students who will come<br />\nto us for knowledge and ideals.<br />\nThis is our opportunity to exert<br />\nthe best influence on our European neighbors.<br />\nHe mentioned the favorable results of the past year, in' spite<br />\nof adverse conditions. The recent<br />\nendowment of $200,000 by Joseph<br />\nde Lamar for the furtherance of<br />\nmedical work, and Dr. Eugene<br />\nMergenthaler's gift of a similar<br />\nsum for a chemistry laboratory, as<br />\na memorial to his father, are<br />\namong the gifts to the University<br />\nsince commemoration exercises<br />\nlast year. Another important announcement was that of the establishment of a memorial in honor<br />\nof their son, Revere Osler, by Sir<br />\n<br />\nDr. Vincent's address will. be<br />\nlong remembered for its eloquence<br />\nand wit. For a background, he<br />\nused the idea of a perfect educational center, as presented by<br />\nSir Francis Bacon's \"Salomon's<br />\nHouse\" in \"The New Atlantis.\"<br />\nDr. Vincent spoke in part as follows:<br />\n\"This is not a company to be<br />\ninterested in mere material things.<br />\nThe Hopkins traditions set store<br />\nnot by buildings but by men. In<br />\nthe personnel and organization (of<br />\nSalomon's House) you will not be<br />\ndisappointed.

After ten<br />\nminutes these also returned. Besides the destruction of the enemy trenches, capturing of prisoners and machine guns, the raid resulted in the acquirement of a lot<br />\nof valuable information, a great<br />\nincrease in the morale of the Canadian troops and a corresponding<br />\nlowering of that of the boche.<br />\nIn was in this engagement that<br />\nCaptain King was slightly wounded.

Dr. Vincent, President of the Rockefeller<br />\nFoundation, selected speaker be- \u2022<br />\ncause we were to celebrate the<br />\nopening of the School of Hygiene<br />\nand Public Health, gave a brighf,<br />\neloquent address, rendered most<br />\nimpressive by his delightful wit<br />\nand effective delivery. His subject, \"The University and Public<br />\nHealth,\" was typical of the beginning of an era of peace and reconstruction since the successful administration<br />\n' of the health of millions of men in the army has<br />\nbrought out more strikingly than<br />\never the possibilities of improving<br />\npublic health. The President's address, read by Dr. Welch, opened<br />\nwith a discussion of the triumph<br />\nof American ideals. Then followed<br />\na mention of the many recent bequests to the University, which<br />\nforetell a period of peace-time<br />\nprosperity and progress for Hopkins. Every part of the celebration was one to inspire hope and<br />\nexpectation of big things for the<br />\nfuture, both in regard to our University and our country.<br />\nThe one regrettable thing in the<br />\nexercises was the unwarranted absence of so many undergraduates.<br />\nThe previous year practically<br />\nevery undergraduate was present;<br />\nand, moreover, walked two miles<br />\nin a snow storm to be there, for<br />\nthe battalion marched from Homewood to McCoy Hall. For the<br />\nlarge number of those who could<br />\nnot rouse themselves in time to attend the 11 o'clock celebration;<br />\nwho thus failed to pay the tribute<br />\nthey owe to the founders the<br />\nPresident and the alumni of the<br />\nUniversity, we have only a feeling<br />\nakin to pity and a sense of their<br />\nloss.<br />\n<br />\nThe Forty-third Anniversary.<br />\n<br />\nThe Adams Debate.<br />\n<br />\nThe commemoration exercises of<br />\nthe forty-third anniversary were<br />\nin marked contrast to those of the<br />\nprevious year. It is true that the<br />\ntraditional, solemn, impressive<br />\nnote predominated; but, in place<br />\nof time grim, oppressive war clouds,<br />\nwhich hovered so ominously over<br />\nthe 1918 exercises, the clear atmosphere of victory, peace and<br />\nhope pervaded this celebration.<br />\nThe invocation of last year\u2014by<br />\na chaplain in the Marine Corps\u2014<br />\nand the report of the President<br />\nwere tinged with the awful uncertainty of the conflict. The orator's- earnest, pointed address on<br />\n\"Limiting Factors in the Food<br />\nSupply of a Nation\" brought us<br />\nface to face with the vital wartime food problem. The khakiclad ranks of undergraduates, who<br />\nformed a guard of honor for the<br />\nacademic procession; the many<br />\nuniforms noted among the faculty,<br />\nalumni and audience; the conferring of degrees upon those who<br />\nhad entered the service before completing their work\u2014every feature<br />\nof the exercises bore the influence<br />\nof the war. We all anticipated a<br />\n<br />\nThe Adams Debate, scheduled<br />\nfor this Saturday, is an event<br />\nworthy of the support of every<br />\nHopkins man. Although devoid<br />\nof much of the glamor of the athletic contest, the annual battle of<br />\nwords is one of the most valuable<br />\nHopkins traditions. Just as the<br />\nathletic team shows on the field<br />\nits physical prowess and the value<br />\nof its coaching, so the debating<br />\nteam displays on the platform its<br />\nmental ability and the benefits of<br />\nits whole University training.

Vincent, President of the Rockefeller Foundation,<br />\nDelivers Memorable Address\u2014President Goodnow<br />\nAbsent on Account of Illness.<br />\nThe celebration of the forty-third anniversary of the University<br />\non February 22 at McCoy Hall was of two fold significance. In addition to the observance of the date of the birth of the institution, the<br />\noccasion marked the formal opening of the new School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic Health.<br />\nUnfortunately, President Goodnow was unable to preside over<br />\nthe exercises, on account of a temporary indisposition, and Dr. William<br />\nH. Welch was requested to take his place. As Dr. Welch had been especially interested in the School of Hygiene and Public Health it was<br />\nvery fitting that he should be able to introduce, as the orator of the<br />\nday, Dr. George E. Vincent, president of the Rockefeller Foundation.<br />\nIt will be remembered that large contributions were made by this<br />\nfamous institution for the founding of the new department of the<br />\nMedical School.<br />\nDr. Welch and Dr. Vincent headed the academic procession, which<br />\ncame slowly into the hall at 11 o'clock. Following them were the<br />\ntrustees, the faculty in caps and gowns, the alumni, headed by Dr.<br />\nG. L. Radcliffe, the students of the Graduate and Medical Departments, and, finally, the undergraduate body, led by Dr. Abercrombie.<br />\nAfter the invocation by Rev. Edward H. Griffin, former dean of<br />\nthe University faculty, Dr. Welch introduced Dr. Vincent, who delivered a highly interesting address, appropriate to the opening of the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health.<br />\nHis address was followed by the presentation of a portrait of Professor John J. Abel, after a brief sketch of his valuable research work<br />\nby Mr. Griffith B. Coale. The gift was accepted by Dr. Welch, who<br />\nthen read the address of Dr. Goodnow. He took occasion to mention<br />\nthe fact that Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, who was recently<br />\nelected to the Board of Trustees, was among the assembled dignitaries.<br />\nThe President's announcements<br />\nincluded a short account of the<br />\nacademic responsibilities thrown<br />\non American universities as a result of the war. \"The present is<br />\nthe time of triumph of American<br />\npeople and American ideals.\" It<br />\nis our duty and privilege, therefore, to uphold the standard of<br />\ntruth and spread it to the ultimate<br />\nbetterment, not only of this nation, but to the world. He told<br />\nhow European seats of learning<br />\nwere temporarily broken up, and<br />\nthat'we must administer to many<br />\nforeign students who will come<br />\nto us for knowledge and ideals.<br />\nThis is our opportunity to exert<br />\nthe best influence on our European neighbors.<br />\nHe mentioned the favorable results of the past year, in' spite<br />\nof adverse conditions. The recent<br />\nendowment of $200,000 by Joseph<br />\nde Lamar for the furtherance of<br />\nmedical work, and Dr. Eugene<br />\nMergenthaler's gift of a similar<br />\nsum for a chemistry laboratory, as<br />\na memorial to his father, are<br />\namong the gifts to the University<br />\nsince commemoration exercises<br />\nlast year. Another important announcement was that of the establishment of a memorial in honor<br />\nof their son, Revere Osler, by Sir<br /><br />\nDr. Vincent's address will. be<br />\nlong remembered for its eloquence<br />\nand wit. For a background, he<br />\nused the idea of a perfect educational center, as presented by<br />\nSir Francis Bacon's \"Salomon's<br />\nHouse\" in \"The New Atlantis.\"<br />\nDr. Vincent spoke in part as follows:<br />\n\"This is not a company to be<br />\ninterested in mere material things.<br />\nThe Hopkins traditions set store<br />\nnot by buildings but by men. In<br />\nthe personnel and organization (of<br />\nSalomon's House) you will not be<br />\ndisappointed. Twelve traveling<br />\nfellows were always abroad, exchange professors gathering information, books and apparatus.<br />\nIn residence, three men prepared<br />\ncatalogues of experiments; other<br />\nthree men made lists of mechanical discoveries; a third triumvirate known as'pioneers' undertook<br />\nnew investigations; then expert<br />\ncompilers assembled all results<br />\nsystematically.<br />\n\"At this point there was a differentiation into applied science<br />\nand pure research. On the one<br />\nhand, fellows called 'benefactors'<br />\nworked out practical utilities for<br />\ndaily life. -On the other hand,<br />\nafter general staff consultation,<br />\nthree advanced specialists planned<br /><br />\n(Continued on pace 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, cgl. 2)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FI V E CENTS<br />\nCAPTAIN KING TELLS OF RAID<br />\nGives Detailed Account of Attack on<br />\nthe Huns in which He was<br />\nWounded.<br /><br />\nCapt.

After<br />\nrehearsing the raid behind the<br />\nlines in trenches marked out with<br />\ntape, the three companies came<br />\nup to the attacking trench at 10.30<br />\nin the evening, making ready to attack at 12.30.<br />\nThe night was clear, with a<br />\nfull moon. The party advanced,<br />\ncrawling through the barbed wire<br />\nentanglements and falling into<br />\nshell holes half filled with water.<br />\nThe Germans kept the skies lit up<br />\nwith flare shells. The barrage of<br />\nthe artillery in the rear sometimes fell short. The companies<br />\nsearched some houses in a village<br />\nand found them empty, erected<br />\nbarricades in the enemy trenches,<br />\nand worked back and forth in the<br />\nlatter, bombing out dug-outs and<br />\ntaking prisoners and machine<br />\nguns.<br />\nAt 1 o'clock the signal was<br />\ngiven to return, all except supporting machine gun parties to<br />\ncover the retirement. After ten<br />\nminutes these also returned. Besides the destruction of the enemy trenches, capturing of prisoners and machine guns, the raid resulted in the acquirement of a lot<br />\nof valuable information, a great<br />\nincrease in the morale of the Canadian troops and a corresponding<br />\nlowering of that of the boche.<br />\nIn was in this engagement that<br />\nCaptain King was slightly wounded.

Dr. Vincent, President of the Rockefeller<br />\nFoundation, selected speaker be- \u2022<br />\ncause we were to celebrate the<br />\nopening of the School of Hygiene<br />\nand Public Health, gave a brighf,<br />\neloquent address, rendered most<br />\nimpressive by his delightful wit<br />\nand effective delivery. His subject, \"The University and Public<br />\nHealth,\" was typical of the beginning of an era of peace and reconstruction since the successful administration<br />\n' of the health of millions of men in the army has<br />\nbrought out more strikingly than<br />\never the possibilities of improving<br />\npublic health. The President's address, read by Dr. Welch, opened<br />\nwith a discussion of the triumph<br />\nof American ideals. Then followed<br />\na mention of the many recent bequests to the University, which<br />\nforetell a period of peace-time<br />\nprosperity and progress for Hopkins. Every part of the celebration was one to inspire hope and<br />\nexpectation of big things for the<br />\nfuture, both in regard to our University and our country.<br />\nThe one regrettable thing in the<br />\nexercises was the unwarranted absence of so many undergraduates.<br />\nThe previous year practically<br />\nevery undergraduate was present;<br />\nand, moreover, walked two miles<br />\nin a snow storm to be there, for<br />\nthe battalion marched from Homewood to McCoy Hall.

It is true that the<br />\ntraditional, solemn, impressive<br />\nnote predominated; but, in place<br />\nof time grim, oppressive war clouds,<br />\nwhich hovered so ominously over<br />\nthe 1918 exercises, the clear atmosphere of victory, peace and<br />\nhope pervaded this celebration.<br />\nThe invocation of last year\u2014by<br />\na chaplain in the Marine Corps\u2014<br />\nand the report of the President<br />\nwere tinged with the awful uncertainty of the conflict. The orator's- earnest, pointed address on<br />\n\"Limiting Factors in the Food<br />\nSupply of a Nation\" brought us<br />\nface to face with the vital wartime food problem. The khakiclad ranks of undergraduates, who<br />\nformed a guard of honor for the<br />\nacademic procession; the many<br />\nuniforms noted among the faculty,<br />\nalumni and audience; the conferring of degrees upon those who<br />\nhad entered the service before completing their work\u2014every feature<br />\nof the exercises bore the influence<br />\nof the war. We all anticipated a<br /><br />\nThe Adams Debate, scheduled<br />\nfor this Saturday, is an event<br />\nworthy of the support of every<br />\nHopkins man. Although devoid<br />\nof much of the glamor of the athletic contest, the annual battle of<br />\nwords is one of the most valuable<br />\nHopkins traditions. Just as the<br />\nathletic team shows on the field<br />\nits physical prowess and the value<br />\nof its coaching, so the debating<br />\nteam displays on the platform its<br />\nmental ability and the benefits of<br />\nits whole University training.

Suffice<br />\nit to say, that if the Hopkins man<br />\nhas not the interest, his duty as<br />\na citizen to consider attentively<br />\nproblems so vitally important in<br />\nreconstruction as this one, and<br />\nhis duty to his class and Univer-<br /><br />\nHenry Evans Cited for Bravery 11<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER takes pleasure<br />\nin publishing the following citation of Capt.
