The real reason for<br />\nthe committee's existence is to formulate an answer to the oft-spoken<br />\ncampus query: \"What's happening to<br />\nour class dues?\" This cry seems to<br />\nbe of greater volume this year than<br />\never before.

The novelties and<br />\noriginal scene-designs are now being<br />\ncut to shape by student artisans.<br />\nThe play as it now stands, is a<br />\nsatirical fantasy, and thereby is considered less serious in its treatment<br />\nof the same theme. In this, the Barnstormers have compromised with<br />\nthose who felt that certain elements<br />\nin the first script might be considered<br />\n\"too heavy\" for gala Barnstormer<br />\nNight.<br />\nThe date for the production has<br />\nbeen definitely set for the evening of<br />\nDecember 16, at the Auditorium Theatre, scene of previous Barnstormer<br />\ndramatic triumphs such as \"She<br />\nLoves Me Not\", \"Boy Meets Girl\",<br />\nand \"Once in a Lifetime.\"<br />\n<br />\nPrice 5 Cents<br />\n<br />\nBoth sides of the current controversy over the participation of the<br />\nUnited States in World War II were<br />\npresented by two members of the<br />\nHopkins history department Thursday morning, when the Liberal club<br />\nsponsored an American Day freshman assembly.<br />\nThe speakers were Dr W Stull<br />\nHolt, Associate Professor of History,<br />\nand Dr Eric F Goldman, Instructor<br />\nin History. The assembly, which was<br />\npresented by the Liberal club, had as<br />\nits topic \"Europe's Fate\u2014America's<br />\nHope.\"<br />\nFavoring the entrance of this<br />\nnation into the conflict on the side of<br />\nthe Allies, Dr Holt declared, \"I think<br />\nit's our fight!

Just<br />\nso long as the world is going on the<br />\njungle basis, just so long as war is<br />\nonly the concern of two nations,<br />\njust so long there will be war.\"<br />\nHe predicted that if the present<br />\nmilitary regime in Germany wins the<br />\nconflict that the United States will<br />\nsee the greatest military preparations<br />\nin its history.

Noncompulsory assemblies with interesting programs and<br />\nan assembly committee.<br />\n<br />\nOur ten<br />\nRip Van<br />\nWinkles<br />\n<br />\nCongratulations, geutlemen.<br />\nYou have arrived at a conclusion reached by Hershner Cross and his Council, simultaneously with Bill<br />\nDiamond and his N-L; with Bill Kempton and Stan<br />\nFinkel; with the assembly committee's recommendations of last leaf; and (pardon us for mentioning it)<br />\nby us, as early as last spring and as recently as two<br />\nweeks ago in these very columns!<br />\nAll of which is a long way of stating a short thing:<br />\nThe Council has dilly-dallied and stalled for five weeks,<br />\nand still made no contribution to the real solution of<br />\nthe assembly problem. We all knew that non-compulsory assemblies were the only type favored, and that<br />\nif students were to come to assemblies they had to be<br />\ninteresting.<br />\nBut the real question, as seen by us, is not yet<br />\nanswered. The important point is purely the matter<br />\nof what constitutes an interesting assembly, and no constructive report has as yet been tendered on this.<br />\nHow much better if the Council had instructed its<br />\ncommittee to use its head, face the problem, and spend<br />\nfive weeks laying out a program of attractive assemblies. If five weeks were needed for the formulation of<br />\nthis last report, is it fantastic to expect that the next<br />\nreport (which, we're afraid, will require a little mental<br />\neffort) is still months in the offing?<br />\nWhen we advised the Council to go easy at the<br />\nbeginning of the year, we didn't think we were administering poison. Yet, except for deciding the proxy vote<br />\nquestion and conducting the class elections, the Council has done nothing constructive all year. Pressing<br />\nquestions clamor for solution; the Council stands pat....<br />\nThe B S A has continued on its merry way all year<br />\nwith not one word of revision coming from the lips<br />\nof a Council member to the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe weekly reports of Council meetings have not<br />\nbeen tendered the paper as planned last year.<br />\nIt has remained for 0 D K and Pi D E to invoke<br />\nthe aid of the Council in considering the question of<br />\nclass dues as related to the Hullabaloo and June Week.<br />\nAll of these and other important issues have gone<br />\nunnoticed or undiscussed by the Council, despite the<br />\nfact that it is supposedly in charge of undergraduate<br />\nnon-athletic activities, and despite the continual prodding which it has received.

Well, only an intelligent consideration, which<br />\nwe are sure the matter will receive at the hands of the<br />\nDean, Norm Heany, and the committee, will effect a<br />\nrational conclusion. Until then, we must entrust ourselves to them. But even a superficial consideration<br />\nreveals many ramifications, not the least of which is<br />\nthe one most frequently overlooked. \u2022 How did the<br />\nCouncil's action of last year, which transferred the<br />\nHullabaloo from the senior class to the junior class,<br />\naffect the S A C budget?<br />\n<br />\nPotpourri<br />\n(number Three)<br />\n<br />\nBy Charles Wieland<br />\n<br />\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014<br />\nThe tea leaves have settled, the<br />\ncharlatan's bony finger has traced<br />\nthe intricate lines in the outstretched<br />\npalm, and the oracle now speaks:<br />\nmore copies of Gershoy's French<br />\nRevolution are needed by the library<br />\nif the sophomore class is to maintain its previous straight \"H\" record<br />\nin Occidental History.

NOTE: Hecht actually<br />\nfound a total of $5.28 deposited<br />\nby student activities from 192124 in the First National bank.)<br />\n<br />\nDuring his speech Dr Sheehy pointed out that the official attitude of the<br />\nChurch has always been one of tolerance. As far back as the sixth<br />\nCentury the pontiff forbid molesting<br />\nof Jews. Between 20 and 30 pontiffs<br />\nhave issued statements to the effect<br />\nthat Christians should in no way<br />\nannoy or make any distinction against<br />\nNon-Catholics. Pious XI was perhaps<br />\nthe greatest friend of the Jews. He<br />\nsaid \"It is not possible for Christians<br />\nto persecute Jews for we are all<br />\nSemites by faith.\"<br />\nIn reply to the question of the<br />\nChurch usurping the State's powet,<br />\nReverend Sheehy said: \"It is usually<br />\nthe custom of the state to usurp the<br />\nChurch power instead of the reverse.\"<br />\nReverend Sheehy closed his address<br />\nwith an answer to the Father Coughlin question. When asked why, if so<br />\nmany Catholics disapprove of Father<br />\nCoughlin, he is allowed to speak on the<br />\nair, Reverend Sheehy interjected that<br />\nhe \"Will not support any movement<br />\nwhich will deny any citizen the loss<br />\nof freedom of speech:\"<br />\n<br />\nwill present as its guest speaker the<br />\nReverend Bernard C Clausen, pastor<br />\nof the First Baptist Church of Pittsburgh, Dr Clausen has chosen as his<br />\ntopic \"The Time Capsule.\"<br />\nAt 6 pm Dr Clausen will speak to<br />\nthe Supper club in Levering hall, and<br />\nat 8.15 pm he will speak at the second<br />\nmeeting<br />\n<br />\nof the<br />\n<br />\nuniversity lecture<br />\n<br />\nseries in the Friend's Meeting house,<br />\n3107 North Charles street.<br />\nBoth affairs will be open to the<br />\npublic and tickets will be sold at the<br />\ndoor at 35 cents per person.<br />\nThe Reverend Clausen was born in<br />\nHoboken, New Jersey and resided<br />\nthere several years. He received his<br />\nAB and MA degrees from Colgate<br />\nuniversity; he also studied at the<br />\nUnion Theological seminary and Syracuse university, receiving his DD de-<br />\n<br />\ngave means to preserve this truth\".<br />\nHence the basic difference would be<br />\ninferred that the Catholic believes in<br />\na very strict adherence to the laws of<br />\nthe Vatican whereas the Protestant<br />\ntends to a more lenient interpretation of the religious law. \"A Catholic<br />\nlives in a philosophy of supernatural<br />\nwhere the supernatural is commonplace.

Their chief objection is to the<br />\nmethod of selecting members to the<br />\nB S A.

In order to<br />\ninvestigate and possibly improve the<br />\npresent situation, a mild form of<br />\n\"Gallup poll\" has been undertaken.<br />\nPossibly the most evident result of<br />\nthis informal poll was the fact that<br />\nless than a score of seniors have<br />\nsigned up at the present time.

The assembly, which was<br />\npresented by the Liberal club, had as<br />\nits topic \"Europe's Fate\u2014America's<br />\nHope.\"<br />\nFavoring the entrance of this<br />\nnation into the conflict on the side of<br />\nthe Allies, Dr Holt declared, \"I think<br />\nit's our fight!

Just<br />\nso long as the world is going on the<br />\njungle basis, just so long as war is<br />\nonly the concern of two nations,<br />\njust so long there will be war.\"<br />\nHe predicted that if the present<br />\nmilitary regime in Germany wins the<br />\nconflict that the United States will<br />\nsee the greatest military preparations<br />\nin its history. At present, he added,<br />\nthis nation is \"depending upon the<br />\nhappy accident of the British fleet,<br />\npreserving a legal neutrality, yet<br />\nexploiting our economic resources.\"<br />\n\"It's not enough to insure the<br />\nvictory of the Allies or to place our<br />\nresources at their command, but we<br />\nmust also organize on the basis that<br />\na breach of the peace. is of concern<br />\nto all.\" He added that Germany must<br />\nnot be defeated solely by France and<br />\nEngland, if a fair peace is to be<br />\n\"I think that European civilization,<br />\nnow endangered by the most brutal<br />\nforce the world has seen since<br />\nNapoleon, is worth fighting for to<br />\npreserve,\" he concluded.<br />\nSharp issue was taken with this<br />\nposition by Dr Goldman, who declared<br />\nhe could see no possibilty of a German<br />\nvictory in the face of the tremendous<br />\neconomic forces concentrated against<br />\nher, and that therefore there existed<br />\nno danger to America.<br />\n\"I don't believe this is a war of<br />\nideologies,\" he pointed out. \"It is<br />\nmerely one of a series of age-old<br />\nstruggles of European nations striving to preserve their hegemonies.\"<br />\nHe declared himself even more<br />\nfirmly convinced that our entrance<br />\ninto the war would not bring about<br />\nfair peace, but that the resulting<br />\nsettlement would make the Treaty a<br />\nVersailles \"look like a document of<br />\nsaints\".

After five weeks<br />\nof research and publicity, of<br />\ncommittee appointments and<br />\ncogitation, the omnipotent<br />\nStudent council has at last<br />\nsolved the assembly problem. The conclusion? Noncompulsory assemblies with interesting programs and<br />\nan assembly committee.<br /><br />\nOur ten<br />\nRip Van<br />\nWinkles<br /><br />\nCongratulations, geutlemen.<br />\nYou have arrived at a conclusion reached by Hershner Cross and his Council, simultaneously with Bill<br />\nDiamond and his N-L; with Bill Kempton and Stan<br />\nFinkel; with the assembly committee's recommendations of last leaf; and (pardon us for mentioning it)<br />\nby us, as early as last spring and as recently as two<br />\nweeks ago in these very columns!<br />\nAll of which is a long way of stating a short thing:<br />\nThe Council has dilly-dallied and stalled for five weeks,<br />\nand still made no contribution to the real solution of<br />\nthe assembly problem. We all knew that non-compulsory assemblies were the only type favored, and that<br />\nif students were to come to assemblies they had to be<br />\ninteresting.<br />\nBut the real question, as seen by us, is not yet<br />\nanswered.

NOTE: Hecht actually<br />\nfound a total of $5.28 deposited<br />\nby student activities from 192124 in the First National bank.)<br /><br />\nDuring his speech Dr Sheehy pointed out that the official attitude of the<br />\nChurch has always been one of tolerance. As far back as the sixth<br />\nCentury the pontiff forbid molesting<br />\nof Jews. Between 20 and 30 pontiffs<br />\nhave issued statements to the effect<br />\nthat Christians should in no way<br />\nannoy or make any distinction against<br />\nNon-Catholics. Pious XI was perhaps<br />\nthe greatest friend of the Jews. He<br />\nsaid \"It is not possible for Christians<br />\nto persecute Jews for we are all<br />\nSemites by faith.\"<br />\nIn reply to the question of the<br />\nChurch usurping the State's powet,<br />\nReverend Sheehy said: \"It is usually<br />\nthe custom of the state to usurp the<br />\nChurch power instead of the reverse.\"<br />\nReverend Sheehy closed his address<br />\nwith an answer to the Father Coughlin question. When asked why, if so<br />\nmany Catholics disapprove of Father<br />\nCoughlin, he is allowed to speak on the<br />\nair, Reverend Sheehy interjected that<br />\nhe \"Will not support any movement<br />\nwhich will deny any citizen the loss<br />\nof freedom of speech:\"<br /><br />\nwill present as its guest speaker the<br />\nReverend Bernard C Clausen, pastor<br />\nof the First Baptist Church of Pittsburgh, Dr Clausen has chosen as his<br />\ntopic \"The Time Capsule.\"<br />\nAt 6 pm Dr Clausen will speak to<br />\nthe Supper club in Levering hall, and<br />\nat 8.15 pm he will speak at the second<br />\nmeeting<br /><br />\nof the<br /><br />\nuniversity lecture<br /><br />\nseries in the Friend's Meeting house,<br />\n3107 North Charles street.<br />\nBoth affairs will be open to the<br />\npublic and tickets will be sold at the<br />\ndoor at 35 cents per person.<br />\nThe Reverend Clausen was born in<br />\nHoboken, New Jersey and resided<br />\nthere several years. He received his<br />\nAB and MA degrees from Colgate<br />\nuniversity; he also studied at the<br />\nUnion Theological seminary and Syracuse university, receiving his DD de-<br /><br />\ngave means to preserve this truth\".<br />\nHence the basic difference would be<br />\ninferred that the Catholic believes in<br />\na very strict adherence to the laws of<br />\nthe Vatican whereas the Protestant<br />\ntends to a more lenient interpretation of the religious law. \"A Catholic<br />\nlives in a philosophy of supernatural<br />\nwhere the supernatural is commonplace.
