The facility will accomodate University staff, faculty, and students, as well as<br />\nMedical Center staff and the more<br />\nthan 200 thousand out-patients<br />\nwho visit the facility each year<br />\nThe office facility will consist<br />\nof forty thousand square feet<br />\nretail space and 110 thousand<br />\nsquare feet office space. While<br />\nUniversity officials do not know<br />\nwhich organizational units might<br />\nbe placed in the retail space, the<br />\nbank, credit office and bookstore<br />\nare all candidates. However, a<br />\nfinal decision has not yet been<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe University has submitted a<br />\nPlanning Unit Development<br />\n(PUD) for approval by the City<br />\nPlanning Commission and<br />\nultimately the Baltimore City<br />\nCouncil. Officials hope voting<br />\nwill occur within the year.<br />\nOriginal plans called for a twophase construction proposal that<br />\nwould include the garage/office<br />\nfacility as well as a thirteen story<br />\ntower, totalling together over 200<br />\nthousand square footage.<br />\nHowever, community response<br />\nto the construction plans had been<br />\nsomewhat negative, causing<br />\nPhase Two of the project to be<br />\ndropped.<br />\n\"At this point our main problem is that we are opposed to<br />\nany decision being reached by the<br />\nCity Council during this term,\"<br />\nsaid Kathryn Colby, a member of<br />\nthe Remington Improvement<br />\nAssociation, the main community organization opposed to construction plans.<br />\n<br />\nThe community organization's<br />\nmain concern is the traffic impact<br />\non the neighborhood, she added.<br />\nIn response to this concern,<br />\nHopkins has hired an independent<br />\ntraffic consultant to determine if<br />\nthe garage would indeed create<br />\ntraffic problems.<br />\n\"Our consultant has found that<br />\nthe level of service for the surrounding streets would not<br />\nchange,\" said Schuerholz. \"We<br />\nare not adding any people with<br />\nthe addition of a parking garage.<br />\nWe're simply accomodating the<br />\nneeds of the people.\"<br />\nThe community is opposed to<br />\nthe garage for other reasons, also.<br />\nWith the implementation of a pay-<br />\n<br />\nparking system community<br />\nresidents feel out-patients to the<br />\nhospital will park on the streets<br />\nin an effort to avoid the garage<br />\nfee. Wyman Park medical officials have answered this fear<br />\nwith plans to provide ticket<br />\nvalidation for out-patients, enabling them to park for free. The<br />\nhospital will pay for this servive<br />\nto the out-patients.<br />\nIf the City Council approves<br />\nthe PUD during this Council session, then the garage should be<br />\ncompleted by the summer of<br />\n1989.

Students work at City Hall or Annapolis for forty<br />\nhours per week in the Intersession period, and twelve to fifteen hours a week during the second semester.<br />\nDuring the semester, interns<br />\nmeet in a seminar every two<br />\nweeks, where they discuss<br />\nreadings on state and local<br />\ngovernment, as well as their<br />\nown experiences in government. A paper on some aspect<br />\nof the legislative process, due at<br />\nthe end of the semester, is also<br />\nrequired. Students receive a<br />\ntotal of four academic credits<br />\n<br />\nfor their work in the program.<br />\nBoth the state and local internships begin in January with<br />\nan orientation program designed to introduce students to the<br />\nlegislative body to which they<br />\nhave been assigned. Several<br />\nlegislators speak on such basics<br />\nas committee structure, how a<br />\nbill is drafted and becomes law,<br />\nand the relationship between the<br />\nlegislative and executive<br />\nbranches.<br />\nBeginning in the second<br />\nsemester, students are assigned<br />\nreadings on state and local<br />\ngovernment that are designed to<br />\ncomplement their work experiences. The readings vary<br />\nfrom traditional political theory<br />\nto analyses of contemporary<br />\npolitics. The readings explore<br />\nsuch topics as the nature of the<br />\nurban machine, the role of community groups in government,<br />\nand legislative reform.<br />\nApplications for the Curriculum for Political Leadership<br />\nare available in Room A of the<br />\nInstitute for Policy Studies<br />\n(basement of Shriver Hall).

When the<br />\npresidents were sitting down and<br />\nabout to discuss the issues, at that<br />\nmoment the so-called Reagan<br />\nRight plan appeared.<br />\n\"It is much like if you were<br />\npreparing a big dinner for a few<br />\ndays, and at the last moment someone would come and give you<br />\nthe menu,\" said Jerez.<br />\n\"The [second] reason is that<br />\nNicaragua came to the discussions in a very free way,\" he<br />\nclaimed. \"Normally, to make<br />\nconcessions, Nicaragua has to get<br />\npermission either from Havana or<br />\nfrom Moscow, but this time they<br />\nwere free to make them<br />\nthemselves.<br />\n\"The next reason was that at<br />\nthat moment, the Central<br />\nAmerican presidents, because<br />\nthey were all gathered together,<br />\nhad the capacity to make demands<br />\nand concessions,\" he concluded.<br />\n\"The plan right now means<br />\ngreat hope for Central America,\"<br />\nsaid Jerez, \"but at the same time<br />\nwe have to realize that to have the<br />\nplan is not enough.

He cited the<br />\nNobel prize awarded to President<br />\nArias of Costa Rica as an impeding factor, because Arias has<br />\nnow asked the Nicaraguan<br />\ngovernment to talk to the Contra<br />\nrebels.<br />\n\"The other nations will twist<br />\nArias' arm and tell him he has<br />\ngone too far because what you are<br />\ndemanding is not contemplated in<br />\nthe plan,\" he speculated.<br />\nJerez claimed a \"very painful<br />\ndivision\" within the Church in<br />\nNicaragua, because of social and<br />\npolitical conflicts between its different levels.

The Task Force<br />\ndid, indeed, learn of problems<br />\nwhich ranged from unsettling to<br />\nserious. In meetings of the six subcommittees, members of the<br />\nHomewood community expressed<br />\na wide variety of negative feelings:<br />\ndismay, frustration, anger, alienation, disappointment, hostility, anxiety, fear. Regardless of constituent<br />\ngroup or status, many people<br />\nperceive that the administration<br />\neither does not care or cannot<br />\ndiscern ways to help overcome<br />\nvarious problems.<br />\nPresident Muller's deep concern<br />\nfor the human climate at<br />\nHomewood and his motivation to<br />\nestablish the Task Force represent<br />\nthe beginning of a process which<br />\nthe Task Force believes should<br />\ncontinue. The Task Force carried<br />\nout its responsibilities in ways that<br />\nhave provided considerable insight<br />\ninto the myriad problems. The<br />\ngroup believes that some of its<br />\nfunctions must be institutionalized<br />\nto carry on the work already begun<br />\nin this regard.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends the creation at Homewood<br />\nof the office of ombudsperson at a<br />\nhigh administrative level. The ombudsperson should be responsible<br />\nfor ensuring the communication of<br />\nconcerns and the development of<br />\nsolutions to problems, and for<br />\nfacilitating improved relationships<br />\nbetween administration and the<br />\ncampus community.<br />\nIn the course of its work, the Task<br />\nForce found that there is a certain<br />\nlack of a sense of community or<br />\ntradition on the Homewood campus. The competition and ambition<br />\ninherent in a premier research<br />\nuniversity have engendered a<br />\nfragmentation of the community,<br />\nwith both individuals and campus<br />\ngroups feeling unrelated to others<br />\nor to the institution. Such a state of<br />\naffairs requires leadership that will<br />\nintervene and provide that sense<br />\nof identity and purpose which will<br />\nrestore unity. In addition, as a result<br />\nof its investigations, the Task Force<br />\nattributes the pervasive sense of<br />\nalienation to the campus's complex, cumbersome and confusing<br />\nadministrative structure.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends the appointment of a blueribbon panel charged with a review<br />\nof governance at Homewood. This<br />\npanel should explore several questions, including the following: how<br />\ncan the administrative structure be<br />\nmade more responsive? what kind<br />\nof university community should the<br />\nHomewood campus become?<br />\nhow can our goals best be<br />\nachieved.<br />\nAt the heart of the problems of<br />\nthe human climate are the ways in<br />\nwhich people here are treated and<br />\ntreat each other. The Task Force<br />\ndiscovered invidious distinctions<br />\namong staff, between staff and<br />\nfaculty, among faculty, students<br />\nand administration. The artificial<br />\nseparation of the community into its<br />\nvarious components creates a<br />\nhierarchy that is elitist and exclusive<br />\nand causes certain members to<br />\nfeel like second-class citizens.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends a reexamination of personnel policies and practices at<br />\nHomewood, including such<br />\nspecific issues as: child care,<br />\nneonatal parental leave, adoptive \u2022<br />\nparental leave, staff development<br />\nand career ladders, grievance procedures, and !.lr'\u2022<br />\n\\A/crnn<br />\nunequal partners in ma,ly aspects<br />\n<br />\nof campus life, as several of the<br />\nsubcommittee statements note in<br />\ndetail.

The Task<br />\nForce also recommends that, when<br />\nthe work of such a panel is completed, a standing committee on<br />\nwomen and minorities be established at Homewood.<br />\nThe Task Force also found that,<br />\nalthough the prevailing attitude at<br />\nHomewood does not condone<br />\nacademic dishonesty, it does accept it as inevitable. Preoccupied<br />\nwith academic and career advancement, some will go to any<br />\nlengths to achieve success. Traditional values, including honesty,<br />\nfairness, respect for others, regard<br />\nfor rights and freedoms, and the<br />\npursuit of truth, increasingly give<br />\nway to a free-wheeling morality.<br />\nTo address such problems, the<br />\nTask Force strongly recommends<br />\nthat a special study committee be<br />\nappointed to examine the possibility of reinstating an honor code and<br />\nto consider related issues pertaining to academic integrity and the<br />\nundergraduate academic environment(e.g. student-faculty contact,<br />\nadvising, mentoring).<br />\nFinally, the Task Force found<br />\ncause to be concerned about conditions at Homewood for the<br />\nUniversity's undergraduate student<br />\npopulation. A lack of community<br />\namong undergraduates may be a<br />\ncontributing factor in many problem areas of the human climate.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends that the administration consider alternative structures for<br />\nundergraduate education (e.g., an<br />\nundergraduate college) and, further, that resources be committed<br />\nto develop adequate student<br />\nspace--including improvement and<br />\nexpansion of the Student Union<br />\nand Athletic Center facilities and<br />\nadditional University housing.<br />\nRespectfully submitted<br />\nJoseph Hall, Chairman<br />\nThe Human Climate Task Force<br />\n<br />\nStatement of the<br />\nSubcommittee on Health Issues<br />\nRecommendations<br />\nThe Subcommittee on Health<br />\nIssues offers the following recommendations to the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force at Homewood:<br />\n1. The Homewood Schools are<br />\nurged to adopt the recommendations of the Drug and Alcohol Task<br />\nForce. In particular, effective health<br />\neducation programs on the<br />\ndangers of drug and alcohol abuse<br />\nmust be initiated.<br />\n2. Similarly, health education<br />\nprograms which promote the notion of \"safe sex\" and a full<br />\nawareness of the transmission and<br />\nprevention of AIDS must be planned and offered at Homewood.<br />\n3. The administration is encouraged to expand upon its work<br />\nwith the Inter-Fraternity Council to<br />\nfoster legal and socially responsible alcohol use among the<br />\nundergraduates, with appropriate<br />\nalcohol awareness educational<br />\nprogramming.<br />\n4. \"Smoke-enders\" programs<br />\nshould be offered at Homewood,<br />\nand consideration should be given<br />\n<br />\nto offering lower insurance rates to<br />\nnon-smokers as an incentive to<br />\neliminate the use of tobacco.<br />\n5. Administration should develop<br />\ncomprehensive health education<br />\nprogramming\u2014offered throughout<br />\nfreshman year and in the dormitories and apartment buildings\u2014<br />\nwhich promotes life-long wellness.<br />\n6. Consideration should be given<br />\nto sponsoring a \"wellness\" day, in<br />\nwhich sound health practices are<br />\nfostered and endorsed.<br />\n7. Consideration should be given<br />\nto extending the services of the<br />\nFaculty and Staff Assistance Program (FASAP) to employees not<br />\ncurrently eligible,<br />\n8. The University's primary role<br />\nregarding health issues beyond<br />\ndirect delivery of health care<br />\nshould be an educational one.<br />\n<br />\nStatement of the Subcommittee<br />\non Interpersonal Relations<br />\nOur discussions with the campus<br />\ncommunity suggest several obvious steps which the University<br />\nshould take to address immediate<br />\nproblems:<br />\n1) A student union should be<br />\nconstructed to provide graduate<br />\nand undergraduate students with<br />\na gathering place which can serve<br />\nas a refuge from academic<br />\npressures and as an effective<br />\ncenter for student activities,<br />\n2)Three or four informal gathering places offering limited food services (drinks and snacks) should<br />\nbe established at convenient locations on campus to promote conversations and informal exchange<br />\namong students, staff and faculty.<br />\n3. The Senior Vice President for<br />\nAdministration should include<br />\nmeaningful discussion of human<br />\nclimate issues such as sexual<br />\nharassment and concerns of<br />\nwomen and minorities at<br />\nHomewood in orientation programs for staff.<br />\n4)The Homewood deans should<br />\nimplement a program to increase<br />\nfaculty awareness of human<br />\nclimate issues.<br />\n5)The Senior Vice President for<br />\nCommunications and Public Affairs<br />\nshould prepare recommendations<br />\nfor a Homewood Information Network to include bulletin boards and<br />\nkiosks, a computerized events<br />\ncalendar, and other means to keep<br />\nthe campus community informed<br />\nabout university news, events and<br />\nissues.<br />\nIn order to provide short-term<br />\nsolutions to the problems discussed above, we recommend that a<br />\nsenior administrator at Homewood<br />\nbe appointed immediately as an<br />\nombudsman or mediator to<br />\nfacilitate the communication of concerns and solutions between the<br />\ncampus community and the administration.

But there<br />\nis more to the problem than poorly attended events; there is an<br />\nadversarial tone to much that happens at Homewood, an unhealthy<br />\ncompetitive feeling that divides<br />\npeople.<br />\nSome students implicated the<br />\nadministration and faculty for an<br />\noverly serious view of student life<br />\nat Homewood. While acknowledging academics as the obvious<br />\nreason for being at Hopkins, many<br />\nstudents noted the lack of fun and<br />\nthe negative view of extracurricular<br />\nactivities held by many faculty.<br />\nThey generally felt that, though<br />\nthere were good student activities,<br />\nmany faculty and administrators<br />\ndid not value or support student<br />\nparticipation in nonacademic<br />\nactivities.<br />\nPerhaps most troubling were the<br />\nnegative feelings of the student<br />\nleaders\u2014students who have been<br />\nmost active during their college<br />\ncareers and who could be expected to have warm feelings<br />\ntoward the University. Many of<br />\nthese students wanted to feel good<br />\nabout Johns Hopkins but could<br />\nnot. They cited the negative attitude conveyed by the administration. One said, \"I feel better about<br />\nJohns Hopkins when I'm away<br />\nthan when I'm here.\"<br />\nIntolerance: The Subcommittee<br />\nheard strong evidence of intolerance and disrespect, supported by anecdotal accounts. A<br />\nfaculty member's characterization<br />\nof homosexuality as perverse,<br />\nselective harassment of women<br />\nstudents by faculty were some of<br />\nthe examples. Many students<br />\ndiscussed the burning of the shanty and the obscene fraternity<br />\nnewsletter, two dramatic and wellpublicized incidents.<br />\nStudents care deeply and feel<br />\nstrongly about the intolerant<br />\nbehavior they have observed,<br />\nespecially if it has affected them<br />\ndirectly.

This report,<br />\nhowever, suggests several actions<br />\nand implies others for improving<br />\nthe human climate on the Homewood campus.<br />\n<br />\nStatement of the Subcommittee<br />\non Women and Minorities<br />\nThe Current Climate:<br />\nFindings and Observations<br />\nThe Subcommittee found that the<br />\nHomewood Campus climate is, in<br />\nmany important respects, chilly for<br />\nwomen and minorities. Five broad<br />\nareas of concern have been identified repeatedly, and those concerns<br />\nare verified consistently by the Subcommittee's investigations.<br />\n1. Behaviors of some people at<br />\nHomewood demonstrate a lack of<br />\ncivility and respect for human dignity and a gross intolerance of individual differences. Persistent and<br />\nrecurring patterns of harassment<br />\nand symbolic violence toward<br />\nwomen and minorities exist.<br />\n2. Women and minorities are<br />\nsignificantly underrepresented in<br />\npositions of authority, responsibility,<br />\nand visibility (tenured and tenuretrack faculty and senior administration). One important consequence is<br />\n<br />\nrecommendation presumes the<br />\ncommitment of resources to accomplish these imperatives.<br />\n2. Improvement of the human<br />\nclimate for women and minorities requires constant vigilance and sensitivity on the part of all members of<br />\nthe Homewood community. In order<br />\nto ensure that vigilance and sensitivity, a standing Commission on<br />\nWomen and Minorities should be<br />\nappointed with a clear mandate to<br />\neducate the Homewood community concerning the importance of<br />\nheterogeneity and the value of diversity in race, ethnicity, age, gender,<br />\nsexual orientation, physical disability, political beliefs, religion and<br />\nculture.<br />\n3. In order to improve the human<br />\nclimate for ethnic/racial minorities at<br />\nHomewood, members of the campus community must understand the<br />\nmyriad of issues related to those<br />\ngroups. Leaders of the Homewood<br />\ncampus should appoint a Task<br />\nForce on Ethnic/Racial Minority Concerns immediately, charging that<br />\ngroup with investigating issues<br />\nrelated to the full campus enfranchisement of racial and ethnic<br />\nminorities.<br />\n4. The Subcommittee endorses<br />\nthe plan of the Academic Council,<br />\nthe Homewood deans, and the<br />\npresident to develop a policy on<br />\nfreedom of expression.

Improvement in the human women and minorities, however, reclimate for women and minorities quires the elimination of sexism,<br />\nmust be preceded by a clear and racism, and harassment in the guise<br />\nunqualified commitment on the part of free expression.

This forms of expression.<br />\nthat Homewood has a dearth of role<br />\nmodels for younger women and<br />\nminorities. Another equally important<br />\nconsequence is the over-taxing of<br />\nthose few female and minority faculty<br />\nand senior administrators who are at<br />\nHomewood: they constantly serve<br />\nas \"representative\" of their<br />\nrace/gender.. . . . A final very important consequence is the public<br />\nperception, both within and outside<br />\nthe Homewood campus, that<br />\nwomen and minorities are neither<br />\ncompetent to hold responsible positions nor wanted in such positions<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\n3. Women and minorities find<br />\nthemselves segregated into career<br />\n\"ghettoes\" (i.e., academics into nontenure-track faculty positions and into<br />\nthe lower ranks; and others into support staff positions which offer little<br />\nor no opportunity for advancement),<br />\nregardless of credentials.<br />\n4. The recruitment and retention<br />\nof women and minority faculty and<br />\nstudents persist as problems.<br />\n5. The disabled population at<br />\nHomewood continues to experience<br />\ndifficulty in physical access to the<br />\ncampus.<br />\n6.

This is also the day on<br />\nwhich the Task Force on the Human<br />\nClimate releases its report. As parents<br />\nobserve the nature of the environment to<br />\nwhich their child is adapting, so too does<br />\nthe Task Force report examine the issues<br />\nand concerns of students, staff and faculty<br />\nhere at Homewood.<br />\nThe Task Force on the Human Climate,<br />\nheaded by Vice President for Institutional<br />\nRelations Jakie Hall, addresses a broad<br />\nrange of issues in an attempt to foster better human relations at Homewood. It<br />\nfocuses on health issues, ethics, security,<br />\ninterpersonal relations, student issues, and<br />\nwomen and minorities. A subcommittee<br />\nwas formed for each category; each<br />\nprepared a statement addressing problems<br />\nspecific to them and most offered set of<br />\nguidlines in an attempt to alleviate these<br />\nproblems.<br />\nThe guidelines proposed by the Task<br />\nForce subcommittees are very comprehensive; used together, they may be very effective in promoting an overall feeling of<br />\nmutual respect and understanding at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nHowever, no tangible change will be truly effective unless people can be willing to<br />\naccept such change. In the chairman's<br />\nreport of the Task Force, Hall writes, \"At<br />\nthe heart of the problems of the human<br />\nclimate are the ways in which people here<br />\nare treated and treat each other.\"<br />\nThe Task Force's Interpersonal Relations<br />\nSubcommittee wrote that \"the campus suffers from a sense of academic elitism\"<br />\n<br />\nwhere respect is won according to academic<br />\nachievement. As a result, students, staff,<br />\nand even untenured faculty are treated as<br />\nsecond-class citizens.<br />\nAccording to the report, faculty \"have<br />\nfew incentives to take undergraduate<br />\nteaching seriously\" and are not made to feel<br />\nlike an integral part of the community; as<br />\na result, they \"develop no sense of committment to the institution.\" Perhaps this<br />\nis one of the main causes of the elitist attitude generated among the tenured faculty. In any event, it is one of the many examples of how mentalities must change<br />\nbefore a healthy human climate will be<br />\nrestored.<br />\nStill, attitude problems lie not solely with<br />\nthe illustrious faculty. The Task Force emphasizes the need for improvements in the<br />\nattitude towards women at Hopkins. It also<br />\naddresses academic integrity; cheating goes<br />\non at Hopkins all too often and is symptomatic of\"a weak sense of community,\"<br />\naccording<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nreport.<br />\nThe Task Force on the Human Climate<br />\nis giving the Homewood community an opportunity to take a hard look at itself. This<br />\nbroad-ranging report can promote<br />\nunderstanding, respect and a generally better atmosphere if people are willing to accept the changes which must be made.<br />\nWe hope that parents will come away<br />\nfrom this weekend encouraged by the atmosphere of academic rigor so prevalent<br />\nat Hopkins. Perhaps they will also learn,<br />\nfrom the Task Force Report, that the<br />\nUniversity has a number of inherent problems which are finally being addressed<br />\nappropriately.<br />\n<br />\nCartering to<br />\nthe humane<br />\nLast Friday night our Shriver<br />\nHall was quite a sight to behold.<br />\nOverflowing crowds sat in the<br />\naisles and students jammed the<br />\nbalcony. Dignataries from all<br />\ncorners of the state were on hand,<br />\nincluding no less a figure than our<br />\nown honorable Governor Schaeffer. President Muller and the full<br />\ntrain of trustees and administrative higher-ups were all<br />\npresent that evening along with<br />\nthe three local television networks<br />\n<br />\nsincere embarrassment that<br />\nCarter obviously felt in accepting<br />\nsuch an award. After being lauded by Muller for devoting his<br />\nlifetime to such aid to homeless<br />\nprograms such as Habitats for<br />\nHumanity, Carter seemed almost<br />\nreticent to accept the award<br />\nwithout a major correction. \"I<br />\nbrought a lot of publicity to the<br />\norganization, and I'm on their<br />\nboard of directors, but I don't do<br />\nall that much,\" Carter remarked<br />\n<br />\nJoseph Gergyes<br />\nand a host of newspaper<br />\nreporters. They had all gathered<br />\nto present our former president<br />\nJimmy E.

The crowd<br />\nwas receptive as well\u2014\"Carter in<br />\n'88\" buttons appearing on the<br />\nchests of some of the citizenry,<br />\nand some going as far as waving<br />\na placard or two. Carter to his<br />\ncredit, however, ignored the<br />\nconvention-like attitude of some<br />\nof the spectators and concentrated<br />\nhis remarks to what the Albert<br />\nSchweitzer award really was<br />\nmeant to signify, the importance<br />\nof humanitarianism in a modern<br />\nworld.<br />\nParticularly touching was a<br />\n<br />\nhumbly. He continued that he and<br />\nhis wife Rosalyn spend just five<br />\ndays out of the year helping to<br />\nbuild houses for the homeless and<br />\nhe receives an award. The director of Habitats \"has devoted his<br />\nentire life to the organization and<br />\ngave up every penny he owned to<br />\nfoster its success. What award<br />\ndoes he get?\"<br />\nThe point hits home.<br />\nHumanitarian works are often the<br />\nleast recognized of all human actions, sometimes the more<br />\ngenerous the action, the more<br />\nquickly it is forgotten. \"The very<br />\nessence of humanitarian work is<br />\ndoing it for its own sake,\" said<br />\nCarter. \"The unsung hero is the<br />\ntrue humanitarian.\" A statement<br />\nsuch as this one forces us to<br />\nreconsider those in our society or<br />\nin fact on our very campus who<br />\ndo not make the front pages for<br />\ntheir work.

Suggesting, however, that departments spend money only when it<br />\ndirectly accrues to that department is suggesting that the only<br />\ndepartments that should exist are<br />\nones that pay for themselves. The<br />\n<br />\nsurvival of the philosophy and<br />\nhistory departments\u2014indeed, the<br />\nsurvival of writing seminars\u2014<br />\nwould depend only on the demand of students they can<br />\ngenerate (bearing in mind that<br />\nstudents often heavily weigh the<br />\neconomic rewards to a particular<br />\nmajor before entering a program)<br />\nand the amount of any grants the<br />\ndepartment can pull in.<br />\nThe value of a liberal arts<br />\neducation is not in learning a<br />\ntrade per se but in learning how<br />\nto think, in learning a<br />\nmethodology for attacking a problem in an infinite variety of<br />\nareas.

Lee Davis<br />\nLast week, President Muller<br />\nhinted that the university<br />\nbookstore may be moved to a<br />\nretail-type center which is to be<br />\nbuilt on the Wyman Park side of<br />\nHomewood. While moving the<br />\nbookstore from Gilman to<br />\nWyman may make sense, I have<br />\na better idea. . . why not move it<br />\nto China?<br />\nMoving the bookstore to Nanjing would serve two major purposes. First, in a country that's<br />\nslowly incorporating capitalist<br />\nideas, the Barnes and Noble<br />\nbookstore, which represents opportunistic exploitation at its<br />\nworst, would be an excellent example to the Chinese of what not<br />\nto strive for. Second, it would<br />\nremove a financial albatross that<br />\nhas been around the neck of many<br />\nHomewood students for quite<br />\nsome time.<br />\nA few years ago, an intrepid<br />\nNews-Letter reporter analyzed<br />\nARA's (Seiler's precursor)<br />\nsemester food bill and after some<br />\ncalculations, discovered that the<br />\nprice per meal was inordinately<br />\nhigh. No one needs to do such an<br />\ninvestigation of B&N. The fact<br />\nthat we're being ripped off is<br />\npatently obvious.<br />\nSuppose for a moment, that we<br />\ncould \"tag\" a book with a<br />\nradioactive isotope the way<br />\nbiologists tag whales. Suppose,<br />\nfor calculation's sake, that the<br />\nbook we tag has a retail price of<br />\n$20.00. Keep in mind that this<br />\nprice is already marked up from<br />\nwholesale before it even hits the<br />\nshelf.<br />\n<br />\nstrengths of its components. In<br />\nshort, while an addition to the<br />\nchemistry building may not be of<br />\nany use to an individual, the collective benefits of the addition<br />\nmay well be greater than the collective costs, even including nonchemistry majors.<br />\nWhat makes this attitude disturbing is that it does not come from<br />\nthe usual quarter\u2014a myopic<br />\nreport by \"business\" interests\u2014<br />\nbut from someone who has<br />\nchosen a liberal arts education,<br />\npresumably on its strengths, only one of which is described<br />\nabove. This is not to suggest that<br />\nall expenditures are good ones; I<br />\nhave no doubt that there is a considerable need for greater<br />\nscrutiny in university policies.<br />\nRemember only that to increase<br />\nthe value of a liberal arts education we must not destroy its<br />\nstrengths.<br />\n<br />\nSkippy Freshman walks into<br />\nthe store, looks up his class in the<br />\nbulletin, and buys our book for<br />\n$20.00. At the end of the<br />\nsemester, he sells it back, receiving $10.00, half of his original<br />\npurchase price. Now, I'd have no<br />\nproblem if B&N sold it for ten or<br />\ntwelve dollars, taking two dollars<br />\nfor their trouble, but in most<br />\ncases this does not occur. Susy<br />\nSimplemind walks into the store<br />\nthe next semester and finds our<br />\nbook priced at 15 dollars or more.<br />\nWhen \"used\" books are returned and sold again, the profit<br />\nmargin for B&N is even greater.<br />\nSome of my friends make fun<br />\nof me for using one teabag for<br />\ntwo cups of tea, but if B&N were<br />\nin the concession business, we'd<br />\nbe drinking tea weaker than<br />\nwater.

While one guard<br />\nhanded his driver's license and<br />\ndocuments to the other, the man<br />\nasked if there'd been a complaint<br />\nfiled against him. Neither spoke<br />\nuntil both had examined his identification and he asked again,<br />\n\"What have I done?\"<br />\nOne guard cleared his throat.<br />\n\"This is a private university; this<br />\nis private property. If you have<br />\nno business here...\"<br />\n\"I was opening an account. It's<br />\nnot a private bank. What was the<br />\ncomplaint?\"<br />\n\"A professor called us,\" the<br />\nother guard finally asserted. \"He<br />\nreported seeing...you walking<br />\naround campus.\"<br />\n\"Can I find out who called<br />\nyou?\"<br />\n\"No, I'm sorry. We can't tell<br />\nyou that. A faculty member called us.

They frisk him,<br />\nand in his pockets they find cufflinks, jewelry, and other<br />\nvaluables pawned in exchange for<br />\ntextbooks.

One question remains<br />\nhowever: can I blame B&N for<br />\ntaking advantage of students<br />\nwhen the students are so willing<br />\nto be taken advantage of? When<br />\nwe discussed the high price of<br />\nbooks, a friend of mine said, \"so<br />\nwhat, Mommy and Daddy are<br />\ngetting the bill.\" To people like<br />\nthis, it makes no difference who<br />\ngets their money, or how much<br />\nof it, because it's not their<br />\nmoney.<br />\nOthers will complain about the<br />\nhigh price of their books, but the<br />\nend of the semester will find them<br />\nback in Gilman, selling their<br />\nbook, continuing the circle of exploitation, whether out of laziness<br />\nor ignorance, I don't know. It's<br />\ncertainly easier to sell your books<br />\nback than it is to try and keep<br />\nthem neat on a shelf. Have you<br />\never tried to sell a book back and<br />\nhad the counterman say, \"Thai<br />\nbook's not being used next<br />\nsemester. I can only give you ten<br />\npercent?\" Rather than sigh and<br />\n<br />\nhand over a twenty dollar book<br />\nfor two dollars, why not keep it<br />\nfor a few months and sell it back<br />\nwhen it's going to be used. If you<br />\ndon't think someone is hoping<br />\nyou sell it now for 10 percent so<br />\nthat they can sell it back to your<br />\nclassmate for 75 percent then you<br />\nbelong back in grade school.<br />\nThere are a few alternatives to<br />\nB&N. First, pay attention to<br />\nflyers which advertise Hopkins<br />\nbook co-ops. Here you can<br />\nalmost always find books for the<br />\nmajor classes. The idea is simple:<br />\nYou can sell your book to a<br />\nclassmate cheaper than he can<br />\nbuy it from B&N and you, in<br />\nturn, will get more cabbage for<br />\nit. At a co-op, you name your<br />\nprice. If your book is sold you get<br />\nthat cash, minus a miniscule<br />\namount which goes to the co-op.<br />\nVery simple, very smart.<br />\nAlso, Baltimore has many<br />\nother bookstores within walking<br />\ndistance of Hopkins that will go<br />\nout of their way to get your<br />\nbusiness. If you approach your'<br />\nprofessors and ask for a reading<br />\nlist, a store such as 33rd Street<br />\nBooks will order them for you,<br />\nprovided a few of your classmates<br />\nwill buy from there as well. After<br />\nyou have use them to do your studying, bring them to Second<br />\nStory Books, on Greenmount,<br />\nwhere you can apply them to next<br />\nsemester's account, or take cash.<br />\nSecond Story is invaluable to the<br />\nArts and Sciences students, usually charging half of a book's<br />\noriginal cover price.<br />\nFinally, ask your professors to<br />\nput class required books on<br />\nreserve at MSE. If they have any<br />\nconscience at all, they'll do it.<br />\nMost will remember what it was<br />\nlike to be a starving student and<br />\nbe glad for a chance to help out.<br />\nOthers will look at you kind of<br />\nfunny and perhaps snicker, but<br />\nthat's life at Hopkins.

After a moment I looked<br />\nup and muttered something about<br />\nhow sorry I was, how disgusted<br />\nI was, how not everyone here is<br />\n\"like that.\" I wanted to buy him<br />\na cup of coffee to replace the one<br />\ngrown cold between us.

Does<br />\nanyone even bother to publicize<br />\nwhether they are still maintaining<br />\nthe shelter?

I had to agree. The Forrest<br />\nCollection with the Computer<br />\nMusic Consort\u2014part of the<br />\nTheatre Project's Dancesampler<br />\n'87\u2014was pure entertaMment.<br />\nAnnual<br />\nSecond<br />\nThis<br />\nDancesampler is a five-week<br />\nshowcase of Baltimore performance talent. The shows change<br />\nevery week to provide exposure<br />\nfor more performances for more<br />\nperformers, choreographers, and<br />\ncomposers. Each company has<br />\ntheir week in the spotlight in the<br />\nintimate setting of the Theatre<br />\nProject on Preston Street and then<br />\nmoves on to make room for the<br />\nnext. Featured companies have<br />\nincluded: the Path Dance Company, a Baltimore-based modern<br />\ndance company; the Phoenix<br />\nRepertory Dance Company,<br />\nUniversity of Maryland,<br />\nBaltimore County's professional<br />\ncompany in residence; the Harbor<br />\nCity Ballet, Baltimore's first professional ballet company; and<br />\nmost recently The Forrest Collection with the Computer Music<br />\nConsort, blending contemporary<br />\ndance, new music, and movement<br />\n<br />\ntheater.<br />\nThe Forrest Collection is a<br />\nselection of dances choreographed by Juliet Forrest. Forrest has<br />\ndirected and performed in New<br />\nYork City for ten years and is<br />\ncurrently an Assistant Professor<br />\nof Dance at Goucher College.<br />\nHer style is flexible and widely<br />\nvaried. Her approach is innovative, the movement of the<br />\ndancers seems an organic<br />\noutgrowth of the music.<br />\nThe first act is comprised of<br />\nthree dances. The premiere<br />\n\"Coming Home\" performed by<br />\nDiana Curran, Barbara Rinaldo,<br />\nand Nancy Wanich Rometta<br />\nopens the show on a subtly wistful<br />\nnote. Composer Bruce Mahin sets<br />\nthe nostalgic mood through the<br />\nuse of the most modern electronic<br />\nequipment.<br />\nThe next dance \"Reinheit,\"<br />\neffectively exemplifies the unison<br />\nof music and movement. The<br />\nstage is shared by composer/guitarist McGregor Boyle<br />\nand choreographer/dancer Juliet<br />\nForrest. Boyle and Forrest<br />\nengange in a musical interplay,<br />\nsharing focus. At one point Forrest walks back and playfully motions to Boyle; he responds with<br />\na sharp musical note. The communication between the two<br />\n<br />\nmediums is clear and effective.<br />\n\"In Drastic Fashion\" closes<br />\nthe first act on an upbeat chord,<br />\nA cast of young dancers\u2014many<br />\nof them veterans of the Goucher<br />\nCollege Dance Department\u2014<br />\nmove to a new wave computer<br />\nsound. Sporting multi-colored<br />\nmetallic costumes and glittering<br />\nmake-up, the dancers frollic<br />\nenergetically and artfully. Set to<br />\nmusic by Michael Pos, this dance<br />\nis the highlight of the first act.<br />\nThe second act opens much like<br />\nthe first. \"Cascade,\" danced by<br />\nNancy Wanich Rometta, was<br />\noriginally written and performed<br />\nover ten years ago. The piece<br />\nshows its age. Lacking the<br />\nfreshness of the other dances, it<br />\nhighlights the strides that computer music and modern dance<br />\nhave made over the past decade.<br />\nThe last dance/movement<br />\ntheater piece \"Near Miss: A<br />\nCalamity in Nine Acts\" is the<br />\nbest thing about the whole show.<br />\nFive dancers become actors and<br />\neven singers in this manifestation<br />\nof Murphy's Laws. Their skillful<br />\nrepresentation of lack of human<br />\ncontrol never degenearates to imitate its subject. Lyricist Sarah<br />\nSchlesinger has collaborated with<br />\ncomposer Boyle to create a very<br />\nfunny, philosophically fatalistic<br />\n<br />\n-Undergrads write and read<br />\nby Brooke A. Ettle<br />\nFor Gil Israeli, co-director of<br />\nthe Undergraduate Reading<br />\nSeries, the weekly undergraduate<br />\nreadings held in the Little Theater<br />\nabove Levering Hall are a<br />\nrefreshing and personal experience. Sponsored by the<br />\nWriting Seminars Department<br />\nunder the direction of Professor<br />\nBob Arellano, the readings provide a \"valuable service in that<br />\nthe writers here at Hopkins can<br />\npresent their material and receive<br />\nhonest opinions from their audience,\" said Israeli.<br />\nThe undergraduate readings<br />\nthat began every Monday night<br />\nat 7:30 are unlike the graduate<br />\nreadings because of their informal<br />\nstructure. Undergraduate readers<br />\noften address their audience and<br />\nshare the personal experiences<br />\nbehind their works. Israeli and his<br />\nco-director Adam Ende encourage this intimacy with the audience. \"The atmosphere of the<br />\nUndergraduate Reading Series<br />\ncreates a good support environment,\" said Israeli. For many<br />\nreaders, the series provides the<br />\nopportunity to receive feedback.<br />\nand reaction to their work outside<br />\nthe classroom. \"The development of Lemniscate was positive<br />\nbecause it created a rapport between teachers and writers. The<br />\nreading series does the same but<br />\namong the students. The two<br />\nik togeTher tcqmprove the entire experience writers have here.<br />\nYou don't just learn to write in<br />\nthe classroom,\" he said.<br />\nThe weekly series, which<br />\nbegan over five years ago,<br />\n<br />\nfeatures all forms of writing including poetry, fictiQn, plays, and<br />\nessays. \"We would love to have<br />\nmore non-fiction,\" said Israeli.<br />\n\"The reading series should be a<br />\nloudspeaker for writers of all<br />\ntypes.\" According to Professor<br />\nArellano, the reading series will<br />\ninclude other artistic media such<br />\nas visual art and music in future<br />\nreadings. \"They [Ende and<br />\nIsraeli] had a band play for the<br />\nfirst week's reading and it went<br />\nover really well,\" Arellano said.<br />\n<br />\nArts<br />\non<br />\nCampus<br />\nIsraeli agreed wholeheartedly,<br />\nsaying, \"Music gives the audience a chance to relax and it<br />\nmakes the readings more intimate.\" Arellano has hopes of<br />\nintroducing video and the plastic<br />\nand visual arts into the reading<br />\nseries within a year.<br />\nAlthough the majority of the<br />\naudience is composed primarily<br />\nof writing seibinars majors, the<br />\nreading series is open to all<br />\n<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. \"Anyone who shows interest and wants to become involved can read or attend the<br />\nseries,\" said Arellano. Israeli<br />\nstressed also that in this year's<br />\nseries only about half of the<br />\nreaders have been writing<br />\nseminars majors. \"Usually, most'<br />\nof the readers are from writing<br />\nsems because they have material<br />\nto read from their classes. But<br />\nwe're open to have anyone<br />\nread,\" he said. Israeli and Ende<br />\nare pleased by the turnout of other<br />\ndepartments to the readings and<br />\ncontinue to encourage this<br />\nparticipation.<br />\nThe job of finding weekly<br />\nreaders poses few problems for<br />\nthe co-directors. Students most<br />\noften approach them and offer to<br />\nread their work. \"For year after<br />\nyear, people understand the<br />\nreading series is here. They simply volunteer and I just have to<br />\nschedule them and work publicity,\" Israeli said. The first three<br />\nreadings presented works<br />\npredominantly by upperclassmen.<br />\nIsraeli hopes, however, that more<br />\nfreshmen will become involved in<br />\nthe readings as the year progresses. According to Sophomore<br />\nJennie Levy, the reading series is<br />\na wonderful place for freshmen<br />\nwriters to meet one another.<br />\n\"Even if you don't read this is<br />\njust a great place to meet people,\" she said. \"The only reason<br />\nknow a lot of the people at the<br />\nreadings is because I came to so<br />\nmany last year.\"<br />\nAnyone interested in reading<br />\ncan contact Gil at 366-0120 or<br />\nAdam at 243-2724.<br />\n<br />\nThe Forrest Collection: Choreographer Juliet Forrest with McGregor<br />\nBoyle, Michel Pos, and Bruce Mahin.<br />\nscore. Out-of-ordinary occurrances abound in this piece about<br />\nlife's ordinary minor mishaps and<br />\nmajor disasters. Narrator Peter<br />\nMadden's dead-pan portrayal of<br />\nsuch characters as a cap-andgown laureate and Moses in a<br />\nmandella is laugh-out-loud funny.<br />\nThis piece truly reaches out and<br />\ngrabs the audience. In the end it<br />\nquite literally brings down the<br />\nhouse.<br />\nThe Naked Feet Dance<br />\ncompany\u2014a modern dance company presenting an eclectic mix<br />\n<br />\nranging from dance drama to<br />\nmulti-media works\u2014is next in<br />\nline for a stint at the Theatre Project (October 21-25). Half price<br />\nstudent tickets run between five<br />\nand seven dollars, depending on<br />\nthe show. Dancesampler '87 attests to the fact that dance is alive<br />\nand well and thriving in<br />\nBaltimore. If you don't believe<br />\nme, take it from the lady in the<br />\nbathroom.<br />\n<br />\nBarnstormers bring<br />\nDeathtrap to campus<br />\nThis weekend, the JHU Barnstormers are presenting the<br />\ncomedy-mystery Deathtrap. The<br />\nBroadway smash by Ira Levin is<br />\npresented in part as entertainment<br />\nfor Parents Weekend.<br />\nThe play centers around<br />\nplaywright Sidney Bruehl (Chris<br />\nBarrett, who you may remember<br />\nas Jonathan Brewster in \"Arsenic<br />\nand Old Lace\"). Sidney hasn't<br />\nhad a hit play in years. So when<br />\nan admiring young playwright<br />\nasks him for help with his new<br />\nplay, Sid greedily accepts. Cliff<br />\n(Jason Hanson, who played<br />\nTheseus in 1985's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\")comes over<br />\nwith a play entitled Deathtrap,<br />\nand it is brilliant. Sidney plots to<br />\nkill Cliff and claim the play as his<br />\nown. Only three things stand in<br />\nhis way: Cliff, who may or may<br />\nnot be trying to kill him; Sidney's<br />\ndisapproving wife Myra (Sharon<br />\nBhagwan, whom you may<br />\nremember from last year's<br />\nFreshman One-Acts); and Helga<br />\nTandorp (Kerry Tesoriero), the<br />\nnext door neighbor who happens<br />\n<br />\nto be a famous psychic, and keeps<br />\nbarging in because she \"feels<br />\ndeath in the house.\"<br />\nRounding out the cast is the<br />\nhysterical Jeremy Golub as<br />\nSidney's lawyer. The play is really a series of crosses and doublecrosses, with a surprise ending<br />\nthat reverses all the plot devices<br />\nwhich come before it. Audience<br />\nmembers are asked not to reveal<br />\nthe ending to prospective theatergoers\u2014that's how mysterious it<br />\nis<br />\nThrill to the comedy, the<br />\nmystery and the wonderful sound<br />\neffects (provided by Eric Moyer).<br />\nThe production is directed by<br />\nDavid Deboy, who has directed<br />\nBarnstormer shows for the past<br />\nseveral years. Deathtrap plays<br />\nFriday at 8:00, Saturday at 7:00,<br />\nand Sunday at 8:00 in the L/V<br />\nRoom. Tickets are $3 for students<br />\nand $4 for the general public. Advance tickets are available for $2<br />\nat the Union Desk.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/23<br />\n.....<br />\n<br />\nSomeone<br />\nnot worth watching<br />\nDirected by Ridley Scott<br />\nThe phrase for the week is leap<br />\no'faith. In Someone to Watch<br />\nOver Me, there seems to have<br />\nbeen lots of editing going on.<br />\nThings are just taken for granted<br />\nwhich shouldn't be, and this<br />\nleaves the film incomplete.<br />\nWe start off at a party at Mike<br />\nKeegan's(Tom Berenger). He's<br />\njust been promoted to detective<br />\nand the scene is homey and happy, full of cops being \"human.\"<br />\nThen we switch to a hip'n'cool<br />\nparty where everyone's in<br />\nblack\u2014Christian Dior black. Lots<br />\nof white strobes and smoke. This<br />\nis Claire's(Mimi Rogers) scene.<br />\nIn the basement of this place is a<br />\nmarble art gallery/swimming<br />\npool, and there, Claire witnesses<br />\na murder. Mike is selected to be<br />\nClaire's bodyguard. Now we shift<br />\ninto rich girl/poor boy dynamics<br />\nwith contrast between Mike's<br />\nQueens life with his wife Ellie<br />\n(Lorraine Bracco) and his kid,<br />\nand Claire's cool, marble<br />\nManhattan life. Sometimes this is<br />\nclumsily done: Mike is unable to<br />\ncomplete even one Daily News<br />\ncrossword; Claire's token<br />\nboyfriend is a two-dimensional<br />\nrich jerk/nerd.<br />\nThere is this attraction between<br />\nClaire and Mike yet we cannot<br />\nwork out where this sprung from.<br />\nThey have only said about three<br />\nwords to each other. Meaningful<br />\nglances do not make for<br />\nchemistry. In fact, they seem to<br />\npicture one another as absolute<br />\nstereotypes: \"You must own a<br />\ndog, Mike, living in Queens and<br />\nbeing happily married.\" Well,<br />\n<br />\nfine, we leap, and assume the<br />\nscene where they did have a real<br />\nconversation was cut. Now we<br />\nare introduced to Claire's big<br />\ndilemma. She has to decide<br />\nwhether she wants to testify<br />\nagainst a killer who could get her<br />\nwhen he gets out of jail. This<br />\nmakes her cry a lot. So the bad<br />\nguy jumps in, to bother Claire,<br />\nand Mike protects her in his<br />\nQueens way, and their \"love\" is<br />\nconsummated. Mike is now torn<br />\nbetween this attraction he has for<br />\nClaire, this urge to protect her,<br />\nand then his loyalty to his good<br />\n'n'happy relationship with his<br />\nwife Ellie. We doodle along here,<br />\nwaiting for the bad guy to come<br />\nin again, and bring some tension<br />\ninto the game. He had initially<br />\ncome off as powerful cruel<br />\nmafioso, but by this point the bad<br />\nguy is just a sweaty Italian<br />\npsychopath. He finally does<br />\nsomething, but it is something<br />\ntotally absurd. He takes Mike's<br />\nfamily hostage. Why, we ask,<br />\nwould any real bad guy go to a<br />\ncop's house (when he's hiding<br />\nfrom the police), and invent this<br />\nhokey hostage trade-off? The leap<br />\no'faith is a lot more difficult to<br />\ntake here, and eventually we just<br />\nend up fed a mealy predictable<br />\nend.<br />\nHmmmm. The tension seems<br />\nto arise between Mike's relationship with his secure sharp-shooter<br />\nwife, and the quivering-lower-liptear-drop-on-the-cheek Claire. It<br />\nalso could be a film about loyalty to the job or loyalty to the<br />\nheart. Or, perhaps, something<br />\nabout how we all want someone<br />\nto protect us? None of these<br />\n<br />\nthemes is ever actually completed, and with all that leaping,<br />\nwe get tired very fast.<br />\nBerenger as Mike is good.<br />\nWell, he's down-to-earth and<br />\nvery humane, perhaps excessively so. He seems to be uncomfortable being a tough guy. He does<br />\nwell in the sensitive-and-notafraid-to-cry department, and that<br />\nis where we like him' best.<br />\nRogers' Claire is a shallow rich<br />\ngirl with nice clothes, and most<br />\nof her acting seems to have to do<br />\nwith crying, looking afraid, and<br />\nlooking vulnerable in a preppy<br />\nway. Ellie is by far the most interesting character, Bracco plays<br />\nher with endearing common sense<br />\nand courage.<br />\nRidley Scott, known for Alien<br />\nand Blade Runner, switches<br />\nfrom the warm beige tones in the<br />\ndomestic Queens scenes, and then<br />\nto deep blue shadows and white<br />\nspots in the Manhattan scenes.<br />\nHis New York is empty, with lots<br />\nof buildings, late nights, and early<br />\nmornings with no one out. The<br />\nelevator seems to prevail as the<br />\nsymbol of the day, followed<br />\nclosely by the almost overbearing<br />\nuse of steam imagery. And then<br />\nthere are the tears of course, lots<br />\nof tears.<br />\nBesides the likeable characters,<br />\nwith which one can identify in a<br />\ngeneral way, the rest of the film<br />\nseems incomplete. So much has<br />\nto be take for granted, and since<br />\nthere doesn't seem to be any<br />\nstrong theme carrying us through,<br />\nit hardly seems worth all the leaping and the faith.<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nNote: If you wish to be included<br />\nin the Arts Calendar, get your information into the News-Letter by<br />\nMonday at 5:00 p.m. for that Friday's issue, care of the Arts<br />\nEditor.<br />\n<br />\nFILM<br />\n<br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series<br />\npresents Desperately Seeking<br />\nSusan.

On any given night, you<br />\ncan hear Tom Petty, Skynnard,<br />\nand a whole host of other hardboiled rockers screaming from a<br />\ncar radio. And, if you go to a bar,<br />\nchances are that you'll hear the<br />\nsame thing live. All this music<br />\ncomes from the same kind of<br />\nroots, tough American blues<br />\nslammed out on makeshift<br />\nacoustic instruments on back porches. Nowadays things have gotten a lot more sophisticated, and<br />\ngarages substitue for porches.<br />\nAnd, while the bar bands survive,<br />\nthey don't do much anymore\u2014<br />\nmost are content to do covers of<br />\n\"Freebird\" for the rest of their<br />\ncareers.<br />\nSometime back in the late<br />\nSeventies/early Eighties, the punk<br />\nmovement spawned something<br />\nnew\u2014cow-punk. This genre had<br />\nthe same intensity and roots as the<br />\nSouthern rockers, but they were<br />\nless concerned with having the<br />\ngood ol' boy party time as<br />\nrevitalizing a kind of music that<br />\nseemed to be on its last legs.<br />\nAs his new album title, High<br />\nPriest, would seem to indicate,<br />\nAlex Chilton might well be the<br />\nleader of this whole mob. Bands<br />\nsuch as REM, the dB's, Dumptruck, and Game Theory count<br />\nhim as a major influence, and The<br />\nReplacements even have a song<br />\ncalled \"Alex Chilton\" on their<br />\nlatest album.<br />\nAlex Chilton sounds a lot like<br />\na Memphis-raised version of Lou<br />\nReed who listened to a lot of<br />\nblues/R&B/gospel music when he<br />\nwas a kid. He's got that kind of<br />\nvoice, you know, the kind that<br />\ncan make even something like<br />\n\"Volare\" sound incredibly cool.<br />\nChilton's style is sparse, uncluttered, simple, in a way that all<br />\nblues music should be. Most of<br />\nthis album is covers of old<br />\nblues/gospel tunes, and I'm sure<br />\nthe former artists would appreciate Chilton's respectful<br />\ntreatment of their creations.<br />\nChilton gives us a few of his own<br />\n<br />\nGallant, they will perform works<br />\nby Mozart and Brahms. The concert is Sunday at 3 p.m. in<br />\nShriver Hall.

The<br />\nclassic singing group has been<br />\nperforming hits like \"If I Didn't<br />\nCare\" for forty years, and<br />\nnobody does it smoother. Saturday night in Shriver Hall at 8:00<br />\np.m. Student tickets are $11.<br />\n<br />\nMISCELLANEOUS<br />\n<br />\nThe Wednesday Noon Series<br />\n<br />\ntunes, however, the most notable<br />\nbeing a little ditty called \"Dalai<br />\nLama,\" which is about, of<br />\ncourse, the Dalai Lama of Tibet,<br />\ndone in what could only be called Tibetan Blued style. Truly a<br />\nmind-altering experience. If you<br />\nwant some incredibly cool music,<br />\nthis is it.<br />\nThis previous discussion might<br />\ngive you an idea of what Dumptruck sounds like. It's not hard to<br />\nhear the Chiltonesque influences<br />\nin their songs, but Dumptruck<br />\ntakes things one step further, constructing much more complex<br />\nmelodies with the slightest tinge<br />\nof southern guitar\u2014something<br />\nthat's very odd, since these guys<br />\ncome from Boston. Their new<br />\nalbum,for the country, can best<br />\nbe described with the refrain from<br />\nthe title track\u2014'drifting on an<br />\nocean', in this case, an aural one.<br />\nProducer Hugh Jones puts us into melody-land, each track<br />\ncarefully layered and constructed<br />\nto be as nice as possible.

In<br />\nAdrian Mole's case, humor and<br />\ntragedy usually go hand-in-hand.<br />\nTownsend does her best to run<br />\nAdrian through the gamut of<br />\nteenage trauma: if puberty wasn't<br />\nenough (and for Adrian it was<br />\npractically fatal), his parents have<br />\nto have marital difficulties.<br />\n\"Marital difficulties\" is perhaps<br />\ntoo mild to describe the ups and<br />\ndowns of Adrian's home life.<br />\nFirst his mother has an affair with<br />\ntheir neighbor Mr. Lucas. It turns<br />\nout that most of England knew<br />\nabout this before self-proclaimed<br />\nintellectual, Adrian Mole,<br />\nrealizes it; the clues have been<br />\npresent long enough for even the<br />\ndullest readers to catch on. When<br />\nshe runs off with Lucas, Adrian<br />\nlooks to his father to provide<br />\nstability and security, only to<br />\nlearn that he is having an affair<br />\nwith a woman Adrian promptly<br />\nnames Stick Insect. The ensuing<br />\nbreakups, reconciliations, grand<br />\nbattles, and in the second book,<br />\npaternity questions, leave Adrian<br />\nconvinced he'll wind up a<br />\njuvenile delinquent.

One of<br />\nthese possibilties is making use of<br />\npassive solar heating. The sun<br />\nradiates tremendous amounts of<br />\nenergy that can be harnessed by<br />\npeople to cut the cost of heating<br />\ntheir homes. Incorporating solar<br />\ndesign into the interior and exterior construction of a house can<br />\nmake the home cheaper and more<br />\nenjoyable to the family living in<br />\nit.<br />\n<br />\nBuilding<br />\nOrientation<br />\n<br />\nLocation<br />\n<br />\nWith most of the sun's heat<br />\ncoming from the south, east, and<br />\nwest, it is best to arrange the<br />\nrooms of the house to utilize the<br />\nheat most efficiently. Facing<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nThe most important factor in<br />\nbuilding a solar home is choosing<br />\nthe correct building location.<br />\nSunny regions with a minimum<br />\nblockage of the low winter sun<br />\nare prime choices. In the winter,<br />\nthe sun rises in the southeast,<br />\n<br />\ntravels across southern sky, and<br />\nsets in the southwest. Because or<br />\nthis, the best location for a house<br />\nis at the north end of the sunny<br />\narea. This insures that plenty of<br />\nsun reaches the house, and it<br />\nleaves room for outside recreation areas and gardens to be in<br />\nlighted areas.<br />\nAdvantages of solar heat are<br />\nmaximized when there is a<br />\nminimum loss of heat in the<br />\nwinter and a minimum gain in the<br />\nsummer. A home with a low of<br />\nsouth-facing glass that is<br />\nelongated in the east-west direction will expose more surface<br />\narea to the sun's radiation than<br />\nany other design. The north side<br />\nof the building receives almost no<br />\nradiation during the summer or<br />\nwinter. In the winter, the south<br />\nside receives about three times as<br />\nmuch radiation as the east and<br />\nwest sides. Conversely, in the<br />\nsummer, the east side, roof, and<br />\nwest side receive almost three<br />\ntimes as much as the south side.<br />\nTherefore, a home located in the<br />\neast-west direction with a maximum southern exposure and a<br />\nminumum east-west exposure<br />\nreceives large doses of solar heat<br />\nin the winter and minimizes solar<br />\nheating in the summer.<br />\n<br />\nRoom Design<br />\n<br />\ndirectly south should be rooms<br />\nthat require the most heating and<br />\nlighting. This is the place for the<br />\nliving and dining rooms because<br />\nthey're continually used during<br />\nthe day. It is important to note<br />\nthat rooms exposed to the sun<br />\nshouldn't exceed a depth two and<br />\none-half times the height of the<br />\nwindows from the floor. The<br />\naverage window is seven feet<br />\nfrom the floor, so the depth<br />\nshouldn't be greater than 18 feet.<br />\nThis allows the whole room to be<br />\npenetrated by the sun.<br />\nLocation of rooms in the east<br />\nand west portions of the house<br />\ndepends on the living style of the<br />\nfamily. The key to remember is<br />\nthat the east section is warmest in<br />\nthe morning, and the west portion<br />\nis warmest in the late afternoon<br />\nand evening. One possibility<br />\nwould be to have the kitchen in<br />\nthe east, if that's where breakfast<br />\nis eaten, and to have a craft room<br />\nin the west corner since it would<br />\nprobably be used in the evening<br />\nhours.<br />\nSpacing that needs a minimum<br />\nof light and heat would be located<br />\nalong the north side of the house.<br />\nHallways, stairs, closets, utility<br />\nrooms, and garages fall into this<br />\ncategory. These rooms also serve<br />\nas an insulating buffer between<br />\nthe used areas and the cold north<br />\nwall. An entrance can also be<br />\nlocated on this side as long as it<br />\nhas an insulating door between it<br />\n<br />\nand the rest of the house. The inside door prevents cold air from<br />\nentering the whole house when<br />\nthe outside door is open.<br />\nEven if the rooms are layed out<br />\nto take advantage of the sun, the<br />\nhouse won't be heated properly<br />\nunless the windows are located<br />\ncorrectly. The logic for their<br />\nlocation is straightforward. The<br />\nside with the southern exposure<br />\nshould have the most glazing to<br />\nget as much solar benefit as possible. Moving to the east and west<br />\nside, the amount of glass should<br />\nbe reduced. If a large section of<br />\nglass is used, more heat would be<br />\nlose than gained. Finally, a<br />\nminimum amount of glass should<br />\nbe used on the north wall because<br />\nit receives almost no solar radiation and it faces the cold winter<br />\nwinds.<br />\n<br />\na small shadow, along with some<br />\ntrees to break the north winds,<br />\nwill expand the enjoyable area of<br />\nthe lawn.<br />\n<br />\nA Traditional Home with Solar<br />\nDesign<br />\n<br />\nnorth side. Upstairs are the<br />\nbedrooms. These don't have as<br />\nmuch glazing as the first floor,<br />\nbut still benefit from the southern<br />\nexposure.<br />\nLike the Saltbox, other homes<br />\ncan be designed to be solar efficient. Remembering that the sun<br />\nshines from the south in the<br />\nwinter and from above in the<br />\nsummer is the key to successful<br />\nhouse design. The final product<br />\nis a reflection of the family's<br />\ntastes, and can make living at<br />\nhome pleasant and efficient.<br />\n<br />\nMany homes incorporate solar<br />\ndesigns. One such home is the<br />\ntraditional Saltbox style house (a<br />\ntwo story house with a roof that<br />\nslopes to one story). The twostory side faces south and the onestory side faces north. The slope<br />\ncreates a small shadow on the<br />\nnorth lawn, and most of the glass<br />\nis on the south side. Inside, the<br />\nfirst floor has a kitchen, dining,<br />\nliving and family room along the<br />\nsoutheast, south and southwest<br />\nsections. Utilities, closets, and a<br />\nprotected entrance are on the<br />\n<br />\nExterior Design<br />\n<br />\nHaving the rooms and windows<br />\nlocated correctly will make an<br />\n<br />\nHopkins treats<br />\nWomen's health<br />\nCourtesy JHMI<br />\n<br />\nimprovement in the heating efficiency of a home. The same principle for interior design can also<br />\nbe applied to the exterior. People<br />\nwant to be in the bright, warm<br />\nsun. Recall that the building is<br />\nlocated at the north end of a sunny area. The south, east, and west<br />\nsection of lawn receive sun.<br />\nThese are excellent areas for<br />\nrecreation, but, unless the north<br />\nwall of the house is designed properly, the north lawn will be in<br />\nthe shadows and nobody will<br />\nwant to use it.

The final<br />\ngoal came from the usual Kathy<br />\nHart unassisted shot from outside<br />\nthe circle. Hart feels that, \"the<br />\nkey to the success of this year's<br />\nteam is scoring. Last season we<br />\nwere outplaying our opponents,<br />\nbut we weren't scoring.\" Siegrist<br />\nadds, \"We've been scoring so<br />\nmuch and winning this season as<br />\na result of teamwork, stick to<br />\nstick passing, and accuracy.<br />\nWith all the scoring the<br />\nHocksters are doing, it would be<br />\neasy to overlook the defense, but<br />\naccording to Coach Anderson,<br />\n\"The fact that we are able to keep<br />\nthe ball on attack can be attributed<br />\nto our strong defense as well as<br />\nthe offense.\"<br />\nThe consistent play from<br />\nplayers such as Kathy Herring,<br />\nKathy Hart, Heather Klink, April<br />\nSavage, Valerie Wilson and<br />\nJackie Fatula should give the<br />\nHocksters a fighting chance in the<br />\ncompetitive MAC tournament<br />\nwhich begins next week.

When asked why the lights would not be<br />\nturned on for the rest of the student body, Mr. Scott pointed out<br />\nthe waste that would be involved<br />\nin leaving the lights on all of the<br />\ntime. He continued to explain that<br />\nif the switch box were left open,<br />\npeople would turn the lights on<br />\nand leave them on after they were<br />\ndone using the courts.

Sean Bramble<br />\nIt's Hot Stove League time approaching, so keep this article<br />\nhandy as a reference when you<br />\nand your friends start arguing<br />\nabout baseball's annual awards<br />\nshow. Here's the picks as I see<br />\nthem:<br />\nAL CY YOUNG\u2014No one else<br />\nin the league deserves this award<br />\nbut Roger Clemens. You know<br />\nhe's a premier pitcher when he<br />\nskips a month of the season and<br />\nstill dominates the league. Sure,<br />\nJimmy Key led the league with a<br />\n2.76 ERA, but Clemens finished<br />\nclose behind with a 2.97 figure.<br />\nHe also led the majors handily in<br />\nboth shutouts and complete<br />\ngames. He was second in the AL<br />\nin both innings pitched and<br />\nstrikeouts, plus he was one of only two twenty-game winners in<br />\n<br />\nthe majors. How can this man not<br />\nwin the Cy Young?<br />\nNL CY YOUNG\u2014I agree with<br />\nMurray Chass; Ryan was obviously the best pitcher in the NL<br />\nlast year. Yes, I know he finished 8-16, but it wasn't his fault.<br />\nCan you blame Ryan simply<br />\nbecause the Astro offense doesn't<br />\nknow in which direction home<br />\nplate lies? Ryan had the best ERA<br />\nand, at the age of 40, set the alltime record for strikeouts per nine<br />\ninnings pitched (the record being<br />\nset, incidentally, by a 19 year-old<br />\nnamed Dwight Gooden). Besides,<br />\ngiving the award to Ryan would<br />\ngo a long way towards rectifying<br />\nall of those Cy Youngs given to<br />\nmediocre pitchers who posted<br />\nflashy won-lost records, just<br />\nbecause the team scored lots of<br />\nruns for them\u2014people like Pete<br />\nVuckovick and LaMarr Hoyt.<br />\n<br />\nAL MVP\u2014This shouldn't be<br />\nall that hard of a pick, actually.<br />\nI think George Bell will win it,<br />\nbut I really believe Alan Trammell deserves it. Alan Trammell's numbers are actually better than Bell's (despite George's<br />\n47 homers), plus he was Alan<br />\nTrammell on defense\u2014he's not<br />\nOzzie at shortstop, but he's not<br />\nGreg Gagne, either. If Trammell<br />\ndoes win it, though, it will be the<br />\nsixth time in the last seven years<br />\nthat the AL has had either a pitcher or a shortstop for an MVP.<br />\nNL MVP\u2014This will be the<br />\nfree-for-all in the awards voting.<br />\nPeople like Dawson, Clark,<br />\nStrawberry, Gwynn, Raines, and<br />\neven Schmidt have a chance. Personally, I'd name Eric Davis<br />\nMVP. He's kind of been forgotten since the Reds did their Greg<br />\nLouganis imitation, but no one<br />\n<br />\nMonday, October 26. The conditioning will consist of swimming,<br />\nweightlifting, and some throwing. Practice for pitchers and catchers begins on the. first day of<br />\nthe second semester, January 25.<br />\nAll other players begin practice<br />\ntwo weeks later.<br />\nWhen interviewed, Coach<br />\nBabb was very optimistic about<br />\nthe 1987-88 baseball team. According to Babb, Hopkins has a<br />\nvery young team for the first time<br />\nin many years. There are only six<br />\nseniors on this year's team. They<br />\nwill be expected to provide<br />\nleadership for a team consisting<br />\nlargely of sophomores and<br />\nfreshmen. Despite their youth,<br />\nBabb believes the team will once<br />\nagain be favored to win their<br />\nleague, the MAC Southeast. Based on the fall season, Babb said<br />\nHopkins will be competitive and<br />\n<br />\nable to score runs this spring. The<br />\ntop two pitchers, Dave Psenicska<br />\nand Jason Klitenic, looked better<br />\nthan last year. However, what<br />\nwill determine whether the Jays<br />\nare very good or merely average<br />\nwill be the performance of their<br />\nnumber three, four, and five pitchers. \"We have some young pitchers who showed the potential to<br />\nfill in the number three, four, and<br />\nfive slots,\" said Babb.<br />\nThe Jays open their spring<br />\nseason with several tough games<br />\nagainst Division I and II opponenets and a team that played<br />\nin the Division III World Series<br />\nlast year. The team will also be<br />\ntraveling to Florida over Spring<br />\nBreak to play games, both in<br />\nFlorida and on the trip down.<br />\nBabb is also planning to play the<br />\nCuban national team in Memorial<br />\nStadium this spring.<br />\n<br />\nelse in the league has his combination of power (37 homers)<br />\nand speed (50 stolen bases). Sure,<br />\nJack Clark provided the jet start<br />\nto get the Cardinals into the<br />\nplayoffs, but don't forget that<br />\nDavis nearly did the same thing<br />\nfor the Reds. Clark just had a lot<br />\nmore assistance. Besides, if<br />\nWhitey had had the chance to<br />\ntrade Clark even up for Davis,<br />\ndon't you think he would have<br />\ndone so?<br />\nAL ROOKIE\u2014It's a foregone<br />\nconclusion that Mark McGwire<br />\nwill be named Rookie of the<br />\nYear. I would like to see Keven<br />\nSeitzer win it, though, as I think<br />\nhe will go on to be the better of<br />\n<br />\nthe two. But it's rather hard to<br />\nargue with 49 homers.<br />\nNL ROOKIE\u2014Benito Santiago. Any doubt?<br />\nThat about covers the major<br />\nleague awards. Next week I'll<br />\npresent my own awards, which<br />\nwill cover those less-than-heroic<br />\nmajor league accomplishments.<br />\nANSWER TO LAST WEEK'S<br />\nTRIVIA QUESTION: John<br />\nCastino was the last Twin to be<br />\nnamed Rookie of the Year.

But the high<br />\npoint of the tournament came<br />\nwhen Hopkins rallied in the<br />\nfourth quarter against Maryland<br />\nto surmount a 9-5 deficit,<br />\noutscoring the Terps 7-1 during<br />\nthe late stages and winning by a<br />\nfinal tally of 12-10. After the<br />\ncomeback, a local shark and<br />\nmarine life expert quipped in<br />\namazement, \"I've never witnessed a feeding frenzy like that,\" indubitably referring to the Jays'<br />\nvoracious, unrelenting attack.<br />\nUnbelievably, the team was able<br />\nto \"rise to the occasions when it<br />\ncounted\" in similar comebacks<br />\nagainst Cornell and Queen's.<br />\n<br />\nSophomore Rob \"Monty\"<br />\nMontgomery claims, \"Most of<br />\nour success comes from our enjoyment of playing together as a<br />\nteam.\" In fact the team is so close<br />\nthat, according to Sophomore<br />\nAdam Bertuch, \"We even party<br />\nas a cohesive unit.\" Also answering for the team's great success<br />\nis player/coach and Senior Jon<br />\n\"Dad\" Fitzgerald: \"Our young<br />\nplayers are very impressive,\"<br />\nspeaking about the talented<br />\nfreshmen Rob Fitzgerald, Fred<br />\n\"Flintstone\" Herberich, and<br />\ngoalie Tim \"Brickwall\" Winders<br />\nas well as Sophomores Rob Montgomery, Chris \"Orgo\" Hussain,<br />\nand Adam Bertuch.

The facility will accomodate University staff, faculty, and students, as well as<br />\nMedical Center staff and the more<br />\nthan 200 thousand out-patients<br />\nwho visit the facility each year<br />\nThe office facility will consist<br />\nof forty thousand square feet<br />\nretail space and 110 thousand<br />\nsquare feet office space. While<br />\nUniversity officials do not know<br />\nwhich organizational units might<br />\nbe placed in the retail space, the<br />\nbank, credit office and bookstore<br />\nare all candidates. However, a<br />\nfinal decision has not yet been<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe University has submitted a<br />\nPlanning Unit Development<br />\n(PUD) for approval by the City<br />\nPlanning Commission and<br />\nultimately the Baltimore City<br />\nCouncil. Officials hope voting<br />\nwill occur within the year.<br />\nOriginal plans called for a twophase construction proposal that<br />\nwould include the garage/office<br />\nfacility as well as a thirteen story<br />\ntower, totalling together over 200<br />\nthousand square footage.<br />\nHowever, community response<br />\nto the construction plans had been<br />\nsomewhat negative, causing<br />\nPhase Two of the project to be<br />\ndropped.<br />\n\"At this point our main problem is that we are opposed to<br />\nany decision being reached by the<br />\nCity Council during this term,\"<br />\nsaid Kathryn Colby, a member of<br />\nthe Remington Improvement<br />\nAssociation, the main community organization opposed to construction plans.<br /><br />\nThe community organization's<br />\nmain concern is the traffic impact<br />\non the neighborhood, she added.<br />\nIn response to this concern,<br />\nHopkins has hired an independent<br />\ntraffic consultant to determine if<br />\nthe garage would indeed create<br />\ntraffic problems.<br />\n\"Our consultant has found that<br />\nthe level of service for the surrounding streets would not<br />\nchange,\" said Schuerholz. \"We<br />\nare not adding any people with<br />\nthe addition of a parking garage.<br />\nWe're simply accomodating the<br />\nneeds of the people.\"<br />\nThe community is opposed to<br />\nthe garage for other reasons, also.<br />\nWith the implementation of a pay-<br /><br />\nparking system community<br />\nresidents feel out-patients to the<br />\nhospital will park on the streets<br />\nin an effort to avoid the garage<br />\nfee. Wyman Park medical officials have answered this fear<br />\nwith plans to provide ticket<br />\nvalidation for out-patients, enabling them to park for free. The<br />\nhospital will pay for this servive<br />\nto the out-patients.<br />\nIf the City Council approves<br />\nthe PUD during this Council session, then the garage should be<br />\ncompleted by the summer of<br />\n1989.

Students work at City Hall or Annapolis for forty<br />\nhours per week in the Intersession period, and twelve to fifteen hours a week during the second semester.<br />\nDuring the semester, interns<br />\nmeet in a seminar every two<br />\nweeks, where they discuss<br />\nreadings on state and local<br />\ngovernment, as well as their<br />\nown experiences in government. A paper on some aspect<br />\nof the legislative process, due at<br />\nthe end of the semester, is also<br />\nrequired. Students receive a<br />\ntotal of four academic credits<br /><br />\nfor their work in the program.<br />\nBoth the state and local internships begin in January with<br />\nan orientation program designed to introduce students to the<br />\nlegislative body to which they<br />\nhave been assigned. Several<br />\nlegislators speak on such basics<br />\nas committee structure, how a<br />\nbill is drafted and becomes law,<br />\nand the relationship between the<br />\nlegislative and executive<br />\nbranches.<br />\nBeginning in the second<br />\nsemester, students are assigned<br />\nreadings on state and local<br />\ngovernment that are designed to<br />\ncomplement their work experiences. The readings vary<br />\nfrom traditional political theory<br />\nto analyses of contemporary<br />\npolitics.

When the<br />\npresidents were sitting down and<br />\nabout to discuss the issues, at that<br />\nmoment the so-called Reagan<br />\nRight plan appeared.<br />\n\"It is much like if you were<br />\npreparing a big dinner for a few<br />\ndays, and at the last moment someone would come and give you<br />\nthe menu,\" said Jerez.<br />\n\"The [second] reason is that<br />\nNicaragua came to the discussions in a very free way,\" he<br />\nclaimed. \"Normally, to make<br />\nconcessions, Nicaragua has to get<br />\npermission either from Havana or<br />\nfrom Moscow, but this time they<br />\nwere free to make them<br />\nthemselves.<br />\n\"The next reason was that at<br />\nthat moment, the Central<br />\nAmerican presidents, because<br />\nthey were all gathered together,<br />\nhad the capacity to make demands<br />\nand concessions,\" he concluded.<br />\n\"The plan right now means<br />\ngreat hope for Central America,\"<br />\nsaid Jerez, \"but at the same time<br />\nwe have to realize that to have the<br />\nplan is not enough.

One must realize<br />\nthat the plan has already started,<br />\nand the seventh of November will<br /><br />\nbe the first check of it.<br />\nThrough this process, he claimed, many rights and freedoms<br />\nhave been returned to the region.<br />\nJerez admitted that the plan has<br />\nsome problems. He cited the<br />\nNobel prize awarded to President<br />\nArias of Costa Rica as an impeding factor, because Arias has<br />\nnow asked the Nicaraguan<br />\ngovernment to talk to the Contra<br />\nrebels.<br />\n\"The other nations will twist<br />\nArias' arm and tell him he has<br />\ngone too far because what you are<br />\ndemanding is not contemplated in<br />\nthe plan,\" he speculated.<br />\nJerez claimed a \"very painful<br />\ndivision\" within the Church in<br />\nNicaragua, because of social and<br />\npolitical conflicts between its different levels.

The Task Force<br />\ndid, indeed, learn of problems<br />\nwhich ranged from unsettling to<br />\nserious. In meetings of the six subcommittees, members of the<br />\nHomewood community expressed<br />\na wide variety of negative feelings:<br />\ndismay, frustration, anger, alienation, disappointment, hostility, anxiety, fear. Regardless of constituent<br />\ngroup or status, many people<br />\nperceive that the administration<br />\neither does not care or cannot<br />\ndiscern ways to help overcome<br />\nvarious problems.<br />\nPresident Muller's deep concern<br />\nfor the human climate at<br />\nHomewood and his motivation to<br />\nestablish the Task Force represent<br />\nthe beginning of a process which<br />\nthe Task Force believes should<br />\ncontinue. The Task Force carried<br />\nout its responsibilities in ways that<br />\nhave provided considerable insight<br />\ninto the myriad problems. The<br />\ngroup believes that some of its<br />\nfunctions must be institutionalized<br />\nto carry on the work already begun<br />\nin this regard.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends the creation at Homewood<br />\nof the office of ombudsperson at a<br />\nhigh administrative level. The ombudsperson should be responsible<br />\nfor ensuring the communication of<br />\nconcerns and the development of<br />\nsolutions to problems, and for<br />\nfacilitating improved relationships<br />\nbetween administration and the<br />\ncampus community.<br />\nIn the course of its work, the Task<br />\nForce found that there is a certain<br />\nlack of a sense of community or<br />\ntradition on the Homewood campus. The competition and ambition<br />\ninherent in a premier research<br />\nuniversity have engendered a<br />\nfragmentation of the community,<br />\nwith both individuals and campus<br />\ngroups feeling unrelated to others<br />\nor to the institution. Such a state of<br />\naffairs requires leadership that will<br />\nintervene and provide that sense<br />\nof identity and purpose which will<br />\nrestore unity. In addition, as a result<br />\nof its investigations, the Task Force<br />\nattributes the pervasive sense of<br />\nalienation to the campus's complex, cumbersome and confusing<br />\nadministrative structure.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends the appointment of a blueribbon panel charged with a review<br />\nof governance at Homewood. This<br />\npanel should explore several questions, including the following: how<br />\ncan the administrative structure be<br />\nmade more responsive? what kind<br />\nof university community should the<br />\nHomewood campus become?<br />\nhow can our goals best be<br />\nachieved.<br />\nAt the heart of the problems of<br />\nthe human climate are the ways in<br />\nwhich people here are treated and<br />\ntreat each other. The Task Force<br />\ndiscovered invidious distinctions<br />\namong staff, between staff and<br />\nfaculty, among faculty, students<br />\nand administration. The artificial<br />\nseparation of the community into its<br />\nvarious components creates a<br />\nhierarchy that is elitist and exclusive<br />\nand causes certain members to<br />\nfeel like second-class citizens.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends a reexamination of personnel policies and practices at<br />\nHomewood, including such<br />\nspecific issues as: child care,<br />\nneonatal parental leave, adoptive \u2022<br />\nparental leave, staff development<br />\nand career ladders, grievance procedures, and !.lr'\u2022<br />\n\\A/crnn<br />\nunequal partners in ma,ly aspects<br /><br />\nof campus life, as several of the<br />\nsubcommittee statements note in<br />\ndetail. The Task Force found<br />\nevidence of active as well as subtle racism and sexism and notes<br />\nthat fact with considerable<br />\nconcern.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends the appointment of a blueribbon panel or task force charged with examining the status of<br />\nracial and ethnic minorities,<br />\nespecially blacks, at Homewood.<br />\nThis study panel should examine<br />\nissues of representation and retention of racial and ethnic minority<br />\nstudents, faculty and staff, as well<br />\nas matters related to the quality of<br />\ncampus life for minorities. The Task<br />\nForce also recommends that, when<br />\nthe work of such a panel is completed, a standing committee on<br />\nwomen and minorities be established at Homewood.<br />\nThe Task Force also found that,<br />\nalthough the prevailing attitude at<br />\nHomewood does not condone<br />\nacademic dishonesty, it does accept it as inevitable. Preoccupied<br />\nwith academic and career advancement, some will go to any<br />\nlengths to achieve success. Traditional values, including honesty,<br />\nfairness, respect for others, regard<br />\nfor rights and freedoms, and the<br />\npursuit of truth, increasingly give<br />\nway to a free-wheeling morality.<br />\nTo address such problems, the<br />\nTask Force strongly recommends<br />\nthat a special study committee be<br />\nappointed to examine the possibility of reinstating an honor code and<br />\nto consider related issues pertaining to academic integrity and the<br />\nundergraduate academic environment(e.g. student-faculty contact,<br />\nadvising, mentoring).<br />\nFinally, the Task Force found<br />\ncause to be concerned about conditions at Homewood for the<br />\nUniversity's undergraduate student<br />\npopulation. A lack of community<br />\namong undergraduates may be a<br />\ncontributing factor in many problem areas of the human climate.<br />\nThe Task Force strongly recommends that the administration consider alternative structures for<br />\nundergraduate education (e.g., an<br />\nundergraduate college) and, further, that resources be committed<br />\nto develop adequate student<br />\nspace--including improvement and<br />\nexpansion of the Student Union<br />\nand Athletic Center facilities and<br />\nadditional University housing.<br />\nRespectfully submitted<br />\nJoseph Hall, Chairman<br />\nThe Human Climate Task Force<br /><br />\nStatement of the<br />\nSubcommittee on Health Issues<br />\nRecommendations<br />\nThe Subcommittee on Health<br />\nIssues offers the following recommendations to the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force at Homewood:<br />\n1. The Homewood Schools are<br />\nurged to adopt the recommendations of the Drug and Alcohol Task<br />\nForce. In particular, effective health<br />\neducation programs on the<br />\ndangers of drug and alcohol abuse<br />\nmust be initiated.<br />\n2. Similarly, health education<br />\nprograms which promote the notion of \"safe sex\" and a full<br />\nawareness of the transmission and<br />\nprevention of AIDS must be planned and offered at Homewood.<br />\n3. The administration is encouraged to expand upon its work<br />\nwith the Inter-Fraternity Council to<br />\nfoster legal and socially responsible alcohol use among the<br />\nundergraduates, with appropriate<br />\nalcohol awareness educational<br />\nprogramming.<br />\n4. \"Smoke-enders\" programs<br />\nshould be offered at Homewood,<br />\nand consideration should be given<br /><br />\nto offering lower insurance rates to<br />\nnon-smokers as an incentive to<br />\neliminate the use of tobacco.<br />\n5. Administration should develop<br />\ncomprehensive health education<br />\nprogramming\u2014offered throughout<br />\nfreshman year and in the dormitories and apartment buildings\u2014<br />\nwhich promotes life-long wellness.<br />\n6. Consideration should be given<br />\nto sponsoring a \"wellness\" day, in<br />\nwhich sound health practices are<br />\nfostered and endorsed.<br />\n7. Consideration should be given<br />\nto extending the services of the<br />\nFaculty and Staff Assistance Program (FASAP) to employees not<br />\ncurrently eligible,<br />\n8. The University's primary role<br />\nregarding health issues beyond<br />\ndirect delivery of health care<br />\nshould be an educational one.<br /><br />\nStatement of the Subcommittee<br />\non Interpersonal Relations<br />\nOur discussions with the campus<br />\ncommunity suggest several obvious steps which the University<br />\nshould take to address immediate<br />\nproblems:<br />\n1) A student union should be<br />\nconstructed to provide graduate<br />\nand undergraduate students with<br />\na gathering place which can serve<br />\nas a refuge from academic<br />\npressures and as an effective<br />\ncenter for student activities,<br />\n2)Three or four informal gathering places offering limited food services (drinks and snacks) should<br />\nbe established at convenient locations on campus to promote conversations and informal exchange<br />\namong students, staff and faculty.<br />\n3. The Senior Vice President for<br />\nAdministration should include<br />\nmeaningful discussion of human<br />\nclimate issues such as sexual<br />\nharassment and concerns of<br />\nwomen and minorities at<br />\nHomewood in orientation programs for staff.<br />\n4)The Homewood deans should<br />\nimplement a program to increase<br />\nfaculty awareness of human<br />\nclimate issues.<br />\n5)The Senior Vice President for<br />\nCommunications and Public Affairs<br />\nshould prepare recommendations<br />\nfor a Homewood Information Network to include bulletin boards and<br />\nkiosks, a computerized events<br />\ncalendar, and other means to keep<br />\nthe campus community informed<br />\nabout university news, events and<br />\nissues.<br />\nIn order to provide short-term<br />\nsolutions to the problems discussed above, we recommend that a<br />\nsenior administrator at Homewood<br />\nbe appointed immediately as an<br />\nombudsman or mediator to<br />\nfacilitate the communication of concerns and solutions between the<br />\ncampus community and the administration. The person appointed<br />\nmust have sufficient seniority to influence administrative decisions<br />\nand must have the confidence of<br />\nthe campus community.<br />\nFaculty-Student Relations<br />\nIn order to explore the special<br />\nproblems of promoting effective interrelationships between students<br />\nand faculty, the Subcommittee met<br />\nwith a group including both junior<br />\nand senior faculty and both<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents. The group agreed that<br />\nHopkins' combination of small size<br />\nand high quality gives an opportunity to build a closely knit<br />\nacademic community of faculty<br />\nand students, mutually committed<br />\nto learning; but all felt that we<br />\nachieve that goal rarely at best.<br />\nDuring discussion. several<br />\ncharacteristics of Homewood were<br />\nidentified as inhibiting the developmerit of a corni-nunty spirit.<br />\n*The intensely competitive en-<br /><br />\nvironment,<br />\nthe<br />\nacademic<br />\nCommittee's report.<br />\nequivalent of the star system in proOur Subcommittee achieved a<br />\nfessional sports, which afflicts all<br />\nstrong consensus on three points:<br />\nlevels of the community; students<br />\n(1) We were strongly agreed that<br />\ncompete for grades and admission<br />\nthe final report of the CFE as curto graduate schools, while faculty<br />\nrently constituted provides an excompete for the trappings of<br />\ncellent basis for further work and<br />\nacademic prestige as measured by<br />\nthat wholesale changes are not<br />\nsalary, tenure, offers from even<br />\ndesirable.<br />\nmore prestigious institutions, or<br />\n(2)Any general university stateleave time for research.<br />\nment of policy on freedom of ex*The tendency for community<br />\npression should include explicit<br />\nmembers to identify with national<br />\nmention of the principle that the<br />\nor international groups\u2014the proright of one group or individual to<br />\nfessions for which students are<br />\nfreedom of expression does not include the right to prevent other<br />\npreparing, or the disciplines within<br />\nwhich faculty work\u2014rather than<br />\ngroups or individuals from exercising their right to freedom of<br />\ndeveloping strong ties within<br />\nexpression.<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n(3)The subcommittee questioned<br />\n*Those bonds which do<br />\nthe workability of the system of<br />\ndevelop at Homewood are largely<br />\nSpecially appointed ad hoc cornacademic in nature and serve to inmittees (as mentioned in the protensify the academic focus.<br />\nposal of the CFE)to play a judicial<br />\n* No value is placed on the<br />\nrole in conflicts arising in the apdevelopment of a balanced person; no one urges the community . plication of the principle of freedom<br />\nto relax and enjoy life or to value<br />\nof expression.<br />\ncontributions which are not strictly<br />\nacademic.<br />\nStatement of the<br />\nThe group recognized that many<br />\nSubcommittee on Security<br />\nof these characteristics stem directly 'from Hopkins' focus on<br />\nacademic excellence, an orientaIn the area of traditional securition which is essential for a<br />\nty,<br />\nthe<br />\nSubcommittee<br />\nresearch university.

Poor attendance at many<br />\ndances, sporting events, and other<br />\nactivities is an indication. But there<br />\nis more to the problem than poorly attended events; there is an<br />\nadversarial tone to much that happens at Homewood, an unhealthy<br />\ncompetitive feeling that divides<br />\npeople.<br />\nSome students implicated the<br />\nadministration and faculty for an<br />\noverly serious view of student life<br />\nat Homewood. While acknowledging academics as the obvious<br />\nreason for being at Hopkins, many<br />\nstudents noted the lack of fun and<br />\nthe negative view of extracurricular<br />\nactivities held by many faculty.<br />\nThey generally felt that, though<br />\nthere were good student activities,<br />\nmany faculty and administrators<br />\ndid not value or support student<br />\nparticipation in nonacademic<br />\nactivities.<br />\nPerhaps most troubling were the<br />\nnegative feelings of the student<br />\nleaders\u2014students who have been<br />\nmost active during their college<br />\ncareers and who could be expected to have warm feelings<br />\ntoward the University. Many of<br />\nthese students wanted to feel good<br />\nabout Johns Hopkins but could<br />\nnot. They cited the negative attitude conveyed by the administration. One said, \"I feel better about<br />\nJohns Hopkins when I'm away<br />\nthan when I'm here.\"<br />\nIntolerance: The Subcommittee<br />\nheard strong evidence of intolerance and disrespect, supported by anecdotal accounts. A<br />\nfaculty member's characterization<br />\nof homosexuality as perverse,<br />\nselective harassment of women<br />\nstudents by faculty were some of<br />\nthe examples. Many students<br />\ndiscussed the burning of the shanty and the obscene fraternity<br />\nnewsletter, two dramatic and wellpublicized incidents.<br />\nStudents care deeply and feel<br />\nstrongly about the intolerant<br />\nbehavior they have observed,<br />\nespecially if it has affected them<br />\ndirectly. We were taken aback by<br />\nthe depth of the anger directed by<br />\nmany students at the protest activities of the Coalition for a Free<br />\nSouth Africa. Some students, particularly those active in women's<br />\norganizations on campus, were<br />\nfrustrated and exhausted by what<br />\nthey viewed as repeated and failed attempts to get administrative<br />\naction on women's issues.<br />\nPower/essness:Most of the<br />\nstudents, even those who knew the<br />\nsystem by virtue of their leadership<br />\npositions, felt that it is difficult to influence policy and decisions.<br /><br />\nStudents need someone or some<br />\npeople to whom they can go with<br />\nproblems, a sort of ombudsman.<br />\nThere are such people, but some<br />\nstudents do not know them, others<br />\nfeel uncomfortable about going to<br />\nthem, and some claim that these<br />\nadministrators are too busy to deal<br />\nwith their problems.<br />\nThe result of these experiences<br />\nis confusion, frustration and, eventually, apathy.<br />\nCausal Factors<br />\nPre-Life Syndrome: The Subcommittee believes that, through<br />\nself-selection and by reinforcement<br />\nor indifference from the administration and faculty, the undergraduates at Homewood view Hopkins<br />\nas a way station, a place to get<br />\ncredentials for the next step, and<br />\nnot much else.<br />\nStructural Issues: The relatively<br />\nlimited housing on and immediately adjacent to campus and the inadequate student union are major<br />\nbarriers to the formation of a strong<br />\nsense of community at Homewood. Students disperse to their<br />\nhomes after class hours, and they<br />\nfind it inconvenient to return to<br />\ncampus.<br />\nA better student union with<br />\nmeeting rooms, communal space<br />\nand attractive eating places would<br />\nserve as a focal point for students<br />\nand a meeting place for all<br />\nsegments of the Homewood<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nOrganization and Communication: The students' sense of<br />\npowerlessness seemed to derive<br />\nfrom confusion about the administrative structure of the<br />\nHomewood campus, inadequate<br />\nresponses to their complaints and<br />\nsuggestions, and generally poor<br />\ncommunication on campus.<br />\nStudents feel excluded from<br />\nalmost all aspects of University<br />\ndecision-making, even those most<br />\nrelevant to their academic and<br />\nsocial lives at Homewood. If<br />\nstudents do succeed in conveying<br />\nto the administration their suggestions for change, they often do not<br />\nexpect change or even a fair hearing. They do not understand how<br />\nor why decisions are made.<br />\nAcademic Seriousness:Johns<br />\nHopkins has a reputation as a<br />\nserious academic institution, and<br />\nthe reality seems to fit the perception.

This report,<br />\nhowever, suggests several actions<br />\nand implies others for improving<br />\nthe human climate on the Homewood campus.<br /><br />\nStatement of the Subcommittee<br />\non Women and Minorities<br />\nThe Current Climate:<br />\nFindings and Observations<br />\nThe Subcommittee found that the<br />\nHomewood Campus climate is, in<br />\nmany important respects, chilly for<br />\nwomen and minorities. Five broad<br />\nareas of concern have been identified repeatedly, and those concerns<br />\nare verified consistently by the Subcommittee's investigations.<br />\n1. Behaviors of some people at<br />\nHomewood demonstrate a lack of<br />\ncivility and respect for human dignity and a gross intolerance of individual differences. Persistent and<br />\nrecurring patterns of harassment<br />\nand symbolic violence toward<br />\nwomen and minorities exist.<br />\n2. Women and minorities are<br />\nsignificantly underrepresented in<br />\npositions of authority, responsibility,<br />\nand visibility (tenured and tenuretrack faculty and senior administration). One important consequence is<br /><br />\nrecommendation presumes the<br />\ncommitment of resources to accomplish these imperatives.<br />\n2. Improvement of the human<br />\nclimate for women and minorities requires constant vigilance and sensitivity on the part of all members of<br />\nthe Homewood community. In order<br />\nto ensure that vigilance and sensitivity, a standing Commission on<br />\nWomen and Minorities should be<br />\nappointed with a clear mandate to<br />\neducate the Homewood community concerning the importance of<br />\nheterogeneity and the value of diversity in race, ethnicity, age, gender,<br />\nsexual orientation, physical disability, political beliefs, religion and<br />\nculture.<br />\n3. In order to improve the human<br />\nclimate for ethnic/racial minorities at<br />\nHomewood, members of the campus community must understand the<br />\nmyriad of issues related to those<br />\ngroups. Leaders of the Homewood<br />\ncampus should appoint a Task<br />\nForce on Ethnic/Racial Minority Concerns immediately, charging that<br />\ngroup with investigating issues<br />\nrelated to the full campus enfranchisement of racial and ethnic<br />\nminorities.<br />\n4. The Subcommittee endorses<br />\nthe plan of the Academic Council,<br />\nthe Homewood deans, and the<br />\npresident to develop a policy on<br />\nfreedom of expression. ImproveRecommendations<br />\nment in the human climate for<br />\n1. Improvement in the human women and minorities, however, reclimate for women and minorities quires the elimination of sexism,<br />\nmust be preceded by a clear and racism, and harassment in the guise<br />\nunqualified commitment on the part of free expression. The Subcommitof the University's leadership. tee strongly recommends that the<br />\nLeaders should be charged with ac- University's policy on free exprestively recruiting women and minori- sion reject sexism, racism, and<br />\nty faculty, senior administrative staff, discrimination or harassment based<br />\nand students, and with serving the on religion, age, physical disability,<br />\nbest interests of women and or sexual orientation as legitimate<br />\nminorities on the campus. This forms of expression.<br />\nthat Homewood has a dearth of role<br />\nmodels for younger women and<br />\nminorities. Another equally important<br />\nconsequence is the over-taxing of<br />\nthose few female and minority faculty<br />\nand senior administrators who are at<br />\nHomewood: they constantly serve<br />\nas \"representative\" of their<br />\nrace/gender.. . . . A final very important consequence is the public<br />\nperception, both within and outside<br />\nthe Homewood campus, that<br />\nwomen and minorities are neither<br />\ncompetent to hold responsible positions nor wanted in such positions<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\n3. Women and minorities find<br />\nthemselves segregated into career<br />\n\"ghettoes\" (i.e., academics into nontenure-track faculty positions and into<br />\nthe lower ranks; and others into support staff positions which offer little<br />\nor no opportunity for advancement),<br />\nregardless of credentials.<br />\n4. The recruitment and retention<br />\nof women and minority faculty and<br />\nstudents persist as problems.<br />\n5.

This is also the day on<br />\nwhich the Task Force on the Human<br />\nClimate releases its report. As parents<br />\nobserve the nature of the environment to<br />\nwhich their child is adapting, so too does<br />\nthe Task Force report examine the issues<br />\nand concerns of students, staff and faculty<br />\nhere at Homewood.<br />\nThe Task Force on the Human Climate,<br />\nheaded by Vice President for Institutional<br />\nRelations Jakie Hall, addresses a broad<br />\nrange of issues in an attempt to foster better human relations at Homewood. It<br />\nfocuses on health issues, ethics, security,<br />\ninterpersonal relations, student issues, and<br />\nwomen and minorities. A subcommittee<br />\nwas formed for each category; each<br />\nprepared a statement addressing problems<br />\nspecific to them and most offered set of<br />\nguidlines in an attempt to alleviate these<br />\nproblems.<br />\nThe guidelines proposed by the Task<br />\nForce subcommittees are very comprehensive; used together, they may be very effective in promoting an overall feeling of<br />\nmutual respect and understanding at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nHowever, no tangible change will be truly effective unless people can be willing to<br />\naccept such change. In the chairman's<br />\nreport of the Task Force, Hall writes, \"At<br />\nthe heart of the problems of the human<br />\nclimate are the ways in which people here<br />\nare treated and treat each other.\"<br />\nThe Task Force's Interpersonal Relations<br />\nSubcommittee wrote that \"the campus suffers from a sense of academic elitism\"<br /><br />\nwhere respect is won according to academic<br />\nachievement. As a result, students, staff,<br />\nand even untenured faculty are treated as<br />\nsecond-class citizens.<br />\nAccording to the report, faculty \"have<br />\nfew incentives to take undergraduate<br />\nteaching seriously\" and are not made to feel<br />\nlike an integral part of the community; as<br />\na result, they \"develop no sense of committment to the institution.\" Perhaps this<br />\nis one of the main causes of the elitist attitude generated among the tenured faculty. In any event, it is one of the many examples of how mentalities must change<br />\nbefore a healthy human climate will be<br />\nrestored.<br />\nStill, attitude problems lie not solely with<br />\nthe illustrious faculty. The Task Force emphasizes the need for improvements in the<br />\nattitude towards women at Hopkins. It also<br />\naddresses academic integrity; cheating goes<br />\non at Hopkins all too often and is symptomatic of\"a weak sense of community,\"<br />\naccording<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nreport.<br />\nThe Task Force on the Human Climate<br />\nis giving the Homewood community an opportunity to take a hard look at itself. This<br />\nbroad-ranging report can promote<br />\nunderstanding, respect and a generally better atmosphere if people are willing to accept the changes which must be made.<br />\nWe hope that parents will come away<br />\nfrom this weekend encouraged by the atmosphere of academic rigor so prevalent<br />\nat Hopkins. Perhaps they will also learn,<br />\nfrom the Task Force Report, that the<br />\nUniversity has a number of inherent problems which are finally being addressed<br />\nappropriately.<br /><br />\nCartering to<br />\nthe humane<br />\nLast Friday night our Shriver<br />\nHall was quite a sight to behold.<br />\nOverflowing crowds sat in the<br />\naisles and students jammed the<br />\nbalcony. Dignataries from all<br />\ncorners of the state were on hand,<br />\nincluding no less a figure than our<br />\nown honorable Governor Schaeffer. President Muller and the full<br />\ntrain of trustees and administrative higher-ups were all<br />\npresent that evening along with<br />\nthe three local television networks<br /><br />\nsincere embarrassment that<br />\nCarter obviously felt in accepting<br />\nsuch an award. After being lauded by Muller for devoting his<br />\nlifetime to such aid to homeless<br />\nprograms such as Habitats for<br />\nHumanity, Carter seemed almost<br />\nreticent to accept the award<br />\nwithout a major correction. \"I<br />\nbrought a lot of publicity to the<br />\norganization, and I'm on their<br />\nboard of directors, but I don't do<br />\nall that much,\" Carter remarked<br /><br />\nJoseph Gergyes<br />\nand a host of newspaper<br />\nreporters. They had all gathered<br />\nto present our former president<br />\nJimmy E. Carter with the second<br />\nannual Albert Schweitzer prize<br />\nfor distinguished service in the<br />\nhumanities, one of the highest<br />\npublic awards our university<br />\nadministers.<br />\nCarter received three standing<br />\novations, praises galore from<br />\nMuller and the gazing admiration<br />\nof the better part of the audience.<br />\nAt such a gathering, it wouldn't<br />\nhave surprised anyone much if<br />\nCarter sneaked in a glint of<br />\npoliticking along with some<br />\nharmless campaigning for his<br />\nfellow candidates and a little<br />\nRepublican bashing. The crowd<br />\nwas receptive as well\u2014\"Carter in<br />\n'88\" buttons appearing on the<br />\nchests of some of the citizenry,<br />\nand some going as far as waving<br />\na placard or two. Carter to his<br />\ncredit, however, ignored the<br />\nconvention-like attitude of some<br />\nof the spectators and concentrated<br />\nhis remarks to what the Albert<br />\nSchweitzer award really was<br />\nmeant to signify, the importance<br />\nof humanitarianism in a modern<br />\nworld.<br />\nParticularly touching was a<br /><br />\nhumbly. He continued that he and<br />\nhis wife Rosalyn spend just five<br />\ndays out of the year helping to<br />\nbuild houses for the homeless and<br />\nhe receives an award. The director of Habitats \"has devoted his<br />\nentire life to the organization and<br />\ngave up every penny he owned to<br />\nfoster its success. What award<br />\ndoes he get?\"<br />\nThe point hits home.<br />\nHumanitarian works are often the<br />\nleast recognized of all human actions, sometimes the more<br />\ngenerous the action, the more<br />\nquickly it is forgotten. \"The very<br />\nessence of humanitarian work is<br />\ndoing it for its own sake,\" said<br />\nCarter. \"The unsung hero is the<br />\ntrue humanitarian.\" A statement<br />\nsuch as this one forces us to<br />\nreconsider those in our society or<br />\nin fact on our very campus who<br />\ndo not make the front pages for<br />\ntheir work. Their actions,<br />\nhowever, are often the lifeblood<br />\nof campus life, and can be<br />\ncrucially important to some of us<br />\nhere.<br />\nEvery society needs heroes and<br />\nrole models so that we can cheer<br />\nthese people on and try to emulate<br />\nSee CARTER, 13<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br /><br />\nPrudent Planning<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe need for more parking at Homewood bank and the bookstore.<br />\nis unquestionable.

The<br /><br />\nsurvival of the philosophy and<br />\nhistory departments\u2014indeed, the<br />\nsurvival of writing seminars\u2014<br />\nwould depend only on the demand of students they can<br />\ngenerate (bearing in mind that<br />\nstudents often heavily weigh the<br />\neconomic rewards to a particular<br />\nmajor before entering a program)<br />\nand the amount of any grants the<br />\ndepartment can pull in.<br />\nThe value of a liberal arts<br />\neducation is not in learning a<br />\ntrade per se but in learning how<br />\nto think, in learning a<br />\nmethodology for attacking a problem in an infinite variety of<br />\nareas.

Lee Davis<br />\nLast week, President Muller<br />\nhinted that the university<br />\nbookstore may be moved to a<br />\nretail-type center which is to be<br />\nbuilt on the Wyman Park side of<br />\nHomewood. While moving the<br />\nbookstore from Gilman to<br />\nWyman may make sense, I have<br />\na better idea. . . why not move it<br />\nto China?<br />\nMoving the bookstore to Nanjing would serve two major purposes. First, in a country that's<br />\nslowly incorporating capitalist<br />\nideas, the Barnes and Noble<br />\nbookstore, which represents opportunistic exploitation at its<br />\nworst, would be an excellent example to the Chinese of what not<br />\nto strive for. Second, it would<br />\nremove a financial albatross that<br />\nhas been around the neck of many<br />\nHomewood students for quite<br />\nsome time.<br />\nA few years ago, an intrepid<br />\nNews-Letter reporter analyzed<br />\nARA's (Seiler's precursor)<br />\nsemester food bill and after some<br />\ncalculations, discovered that the<br />\nprice per meal was inordinately<br />\nhigh. No one needs to do such an<br />\ninvestigation of B&amp;N. The fact<br />\nthat we're being ripped off is<br />\npatently obvious.<br />\nSuppose for a moment, that we<br />\ncould \"tag\" a book with a<br />\nradioactive isotope the way<br />\nbiologists tag whales. Suppose,<br />\nfor calculation's sake, that the<br />\nbook we tag has a retail price of<br />\n$20.00. Keep in mind that this<br />\nprice is already marked up from<br />\nwholesale before it even hits the<br />\nshelf.<br /><br />\nstrengths of its components. In<br />\nshort, while an addition to the<br />\nchemistry building may not be of<br />\nany use to an individual, the collective benefits of the addition<br />\nmay well be greater than the collective costs, even including nonchemistry majors.<br />\nWhat makes this attitude disturbing is that it does not come from<br />\nthe usual quarter\u2014a myopic<br />\nreport by \"business\" interests\u2014<br />\nbut from someone who has<br />\nchosen a liberal arts education,<br />\npresumably on its strengths, only one of which is described<br />\nabove. This is not to suggest that<br />\nall expenditures are good ones; I<br />\nhave no doubt that there is a considerable need for greater<br />\nscrutiny in university policies.<br />\nRemember only that to increase<br />\nthe value of a liberal arts education we must not destroy its<br />\nstrengths.<br /><br />\nSkippy Freshman walks into<br />\nthe store, looks up his class in the<br />\nbulletin, and buys our book for<br />\n$20.00.

Now, I'd have no<br />\nproblem if B&amp;N sold it for ten or<br />\ntwelve dollars, taking two dollars<br />\nfor their trouble, but in most<br />\ncases this does not occur.

While one guard<br />\nhanded his driver's license and<br />\ndocuments to the other, the man<br />\nasked if there'd been a complaint<br />\nfiled against him. Neither spoke<br />\nuntil both had examined his identification and he asked again,<br />\n\"What have I done?\"<br />\nOne guard cleared his throat.<br />\n\"This is a private university; this<br />\nis private property. If you have<br />\nno business here...\"<br />\n\"I was opening an account. It's<br />\nnot a private bank.

One question remains<br />\nhowever: can I blame B&amp;N for<br />\ntaking advantage of students<br />\nwhen the students are so willing<br />\nto be taken advantage of? When<br />\nwe discussed the high price of<br />\nbooks, a friend of mine said, \"so<br />\nwhat, Mommy and Daddy are<br />\ngetting the bill.\" To people like<br />\nthis, it makes no difference who<br />\ngets their money, or how much<br />\nof it, because it's not their<br />\nmoney.<br />\nOthers will complain about the<br />\nhigh price of their books, but the<br />\nend of the semester will find them<br />\nback in Gilman, selling their<br />\nbook, continuing the circle of exploitation, whether out of laziness<br />\nor ignorance, I don't know. It's<br />\ncertainly easier to sell your books<br />\nback than it is to try and keep<br />\nthem neat on a shelf. Have you<br />\never tried to sell a book back and<br />\nhad the counterman say, \"Thai<br />\nbook's not being used next<br />\nsemester. I can only give you ten<br />\npercent?\" Rather than sigh and<br /><br />\nhand over a twenty dollar book<br />\nfor two dollars, why not keep it<br />\nfor a few months and sell it back<br />\nwhen it's going to be used. If you<br />\ndon't think someone is hoping<br />\nyou sell it now for 10 percent so<br />\nthat they can sell it back to your<br />\nclassmate for 75 percent then you<br />\nbelong back in grade school.<br />\nThere are a few alternatives to<br />\nB&amp;N. First, pay attention to<br />\nflyers which advertise Hopkins<br />\nbook co-ops. Here you can<br />\nalmost always find books for the<br />\nmajor classes. The idea is simple:<br />\nYou can sell your book to a<br />\nclassmate cheaper than he can<br />\nbuy it from B&amp;N and you, in<br />\nturn, will get more cabbage for<br />\nit. At a co-op, you name your<br />\nprice. If your book is sold you get<br />\nthat cash, minus a miniscule<br />\namount which goes to the co-op.<br />\nVery simple, very smart.<br />\nAlso, Baltimore has many<br />\nother bookstores within walking<br />\ndistance of Hopkins that will go<br />\nout of their way to get your<br />\nbusiness. If you approach your'<br />\nprofessors and ask for a reading<br />\nlist, a store such as 33rd Street<br />\nBooks will order them for you,<br />\nprovided a few of your classmates<br />\nwill buy from there as well. After<br />\nyou have use them to do your studying, bring them to Second<br />\nStory Books, on Greenmount,<br />\nwhere you can apply them to next<br />\nsemester's account, or take cash.<br />\nSecond Story is invaluable to the<br />\nArts and Sciences students, usually charging half of a book's<br />\noriginal cover price.<br />\nFinally, ask your professors to<br />\nput class required books on<br />\nreserve at MSE. If they have any<br />\nconscience at all, they'll do it.<br />\nMost will remember what it was<br />\nlike to be a starving student and<br />\nbe glad for a chance to help out.<br />\nOthers will look at you kind of<br />\nfunny and perhaps snicker, but<br />\nthat's life at Hopkins.

After a moment I looked<br />\nup and muttered something about<br />\nhow sorry I was, how disgusted<br />\nI was, how not everyone here is<br />\n\"like that.\" I wanted to buy him<br />\na cup of coffee to replace the one<br />\ngrown cold between us.

Featured companies have<br />\nincluded: the Path Dance Company, a Baltimore-based modern<br />\ndance company; the Phoenix<br />\nRepertory Dance Company,<br />\nUniversity of Maryland,<br />\nBaltimore County's professional<br />\ncompany in residence; the Harbor<br />\nCity Ballet, Baltimore's first professional ballet company; and<br />\nmost recently The Forrest Collection with the Computer Music<br />\nConsort, blending contemporary<br />\ndance, new music, and movement<br /><br />\ntheater.<br />\nThe Forrest Collection is a<br />\nselection of dances choreographed by Juliet Forrest. Forrest has<br />\ndirected and performed in New<br />\nYork City for ten years and is<br />\ncurrently an Assistant Professor<br />\nof Dance at Goucher College.<br />\nHer style is flexible and widely<br />\nvaried. Her approach is innovative, the movement of the<br />\ndancers seems an organic<br />\noutgrowth of the music.<br />\nThe first act is comprised of<br />\nthree dances. The premiere<br />\n\"Coming Home\" performed by<br />\nDiana Curran, Barbara Rinaldo,<br />\nand Nancy Wanich Rometta<br />\nopens the show on a subtly wistful<br />\nnote. Composer Bruce Mahin sets<br />\nthe nostalgic mood through the<br />\nuse of the most modern electronic<br />\nequipment.<br />\nThe next dance \"Reinheit,\"<br />\neffectively exemplifies the unison<br />\nof music and movement. The<br />\nstage is shared by composer/guitarist McGregor Boyle<br />\nand choreographer/dancer Juliet<br />\nForrest. Boyle and Forrest<br />\nengange in a musical interplay,<br />\nsharing focus. At one point Forrest walks back and playfully motions to Boyle; he responds with<br />\na sharp musical note. The communication between the two<br /><br />\nmediums is clear and effective.<br />\n\"In Drastic Fashion\" closes<br />\nthe first act on an upbeat chord,<br />\nA cast of young dancers\u2014many<br />\nof them veterans of the Goucher<br />\nCollege Dance Department\u2014<br />\nmove to a new wave computer<br />\nsound. Sporting multi-colored<br />\nmetallic costumes and glittering<br />\nmake-up, the dancers frollic<br />\nenergetically and artfully. Set to<br />\nmusic by Michael Pos, this dance<br />\nis the highlight of the first act.<br />\nThe second act opens much like<br />\nthe first. \"Cascade,\" danced by<br />\nNancy Wanich Rometta, was<br />\noriginally written and performed<br />\nover ten years ago. The piece<br />\nshows its age. Lacking the<br />\nfreshness of the other dances, it<br />\nhighlights the strides that computer music and modern dance<br />\nhave made over the past decade.<br />\nThe last dance/movement<br />\ntheater piece \"Near Miss: A<br />\nCalamity in Nine Acts\" is the<br />\nbest thing about the whole show.<br />\nFive dancers become actors and<br />\neven singers in this manifestation<br />\nof Murphy's Laws. Their skillful<br />\nrepresentation of lack of human<br />\ncontrol never degenearates to imitate its subject. Lyricist Sarah<br />\nSchlesinger has collaborated with<br />\ncomposer Boyle to create a very<br />\nfunny, philosophically fatalistic<br /><br />\n-Undergrads write and read<br />\nby Brooke A. Ettle<br />\nFor Gil Israeli, co-director of<br />\nthe Undergraduate Reading<br />\nSeries, the weekly undergraduate<br />\nreadings held in the Little Theater<br />\nabove Levering Hall are a<br />\nrefreshing and personal experience. Sponsored by the<br />\nWriting Seminars Department<br />\nunder the direction of Professor<br />\nBob Arellano, the readings provide a \"valuable service in that<br />\nthe writers here at Hopkins can<br />\npresent their material and receive<br />\nhonest opinions from their audience,\" said Israeli.<br />\nThe undergraduate readings<br />\nthat began every Monday night<br />\nat 7:30 are unlike the graduate<br />\nreadings because of their informal<br />\nstructure. Undergraduate readers<br />\noften address their audience and<br />\nshare the personal experiences<br />\nbehind their works. Israeli and his<br />\nco-director Adam Ende encourage this intimacy with the audience. \"The atmosphere of the<br />\nUndergraduate Reading Series<br />\ncreates a good support environment,\" said Israeli. For many<br />\nreaders, the series provides the<br />\nopportunity to receive feedback.<br />\nand reaction to their work outside<br />\nthe classroom. \"The development of Lemniscate was positive<br />\nbecause it created a rapport between teachers and writers. The<br />\nreading series does the same but<br />\namong the students. The two<br />\nik togeTher tcqmprove the entire experience writers have here.<br />\nYou don't just learn to write in<br />\nthe classroom,\" he said.<br />\nThe weekly series, which<br />\nbegan over five years ago,<br /><br />\nfeatures all forms of writing including poetry, fictiQn, plays, and<br />\nessays. \"We would love to have<br />\nmore non-fiction,\" said Israeli.<br />\n\"The reading series should be a<br />\nloudspeaker for writers of all<br />\ntypes.\" According to Professor<br />\nArellano, the reading series will<br />\ninclude other artistic media such<br />\nas visual art and music in future<br />\nreadings. \"They [Ende and<br />\nIsraeli] had a band play for the<br />\nfirst week's reading and it went<br />\nover really well,\" Arellano said.<br /><br />\nArts<br />\non<br />\nCampus<br />\nIsraeli agreed wholeheartedly,<br />\nsaying, \"Music gives the audience a chance to relax and it<br />\nmakes the readings more intimate.\" Arellano has hopes of<br />\nintroducing video and the plastic<br />\nand visual arts into the reading<br />\nseries within a year.<br />\nAlthough the majority of the<br />\naudience is composed primarily<br />\nof writing seibinars majors, the<br />\nreading series is open to all<br /><br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. \"Anyone who shows interest and wants to become involved can read or attend the<br />\nseries,\" said Arellano. Israeli<br />\nstressed also that in this year's<br />\nseries only about half of the<br />\nreaders have been writing<br />\nseminars majors. \"Usually, most'<br />\nof the readers are from writing<br />\nsems because they have material<br />\nto read from their classes. But<br />\nwe're open to have anyone<br />\nread,\" he said. Israeli and Ende<br />\nare pleased by the turnout of other<br />\ndepartments to the readings and<br />\ncontinue to encourage this<br />\nparticipation.<br />\nThe job of finding weekly<br />\nreaders poses few problems for<br />\nthe co-directors. Students most<br />\noften approach them and offer to<br />\nread their work. \"For year after<br />\nyear, people understand the<br />\nreading series is here. They simply volunteer and I just have to<br />\nschedule them and work publicity,\" Israeli said. The first three<br />\nreadings presented works<br />\npredominantly by upperclassmen.<br />\nIsraeli hopes, however, that more<br />\nfreshmen will become involved in<br />\nthe readings as the year progresses. According to Sophomore<br />\nJennie Levy, the reading series is<br />\na wonderful place for freshmen<br />\nwriters to meet one another.<br />\n\"Even if you don't read this is<br />\njust a great place to meet people,\" she said. \"The only reason<br />\nknow a lot of the people at the<br />\nreadings is because I came to so<br />\nmany last year.\"<br />\nAnyone interested in reading<br />\ncan contact Gil at 366-0120 or<br />\nAdam at 243-2724.<br /><br />\nThe Forrest Collection: Choreographer Juliet Forrest with McGregor<br />\nBoyle, Michel Pos, and Bruce Mahin.<br />\nscore. Out-of-ordinary occurrances abound in this piece about<br />\nlife's ordinary minor mishaps and<br />\nmajor disasters. Narrator Peter<br />\nMadden's dead-pan portrayal of<br />\nsuch characters as a cap-andgown laureate and Moses in a<br />\nmandella is laugh-out-loud funny.<br />\nThis piece truly reaches out and<br />\ngrabs the audience. In the end it<br />\nquite literally brings down the<br />\nhouse.<br />\nThe Naked Feet Dance<br />\ncompany\u2014a modern dance company presenting an eclectic mix<br /><br />\nranging from dance drama to<br />\nmulti-media works\u2014is next in<br />\nline for a stint at the Theatre Project (October 21-25). Half price<br />\nstudent tickets run between five<br />\nand seven dollars, depending on<br />\nthe show. Dancesampler '87 attests to the fact that dance is alive<br />\nand well and thriving in<br />\nBaltimore. If you don't believe<br />\nme, take it from the lady in the<br />\nbathroom.<br /><br />\nBarnstormers bring<br />\nDeathtrap to campus<br />\nThis weekend, the JHU Barnstormers are presenting the<br />\ncomedy-mystery Deathtrap. The<br />\nBroadway smash by Ira Levin is<br />\npresented in part as entertainment<br />\nfor Parents Weekend.<br />\nThe play centers around<br />\nplaywright Sidney Bruehl (Chris<br />\nBarrett, who you may remember<br />\nas Jonathan Brewster in \"Arsenic<br />\nand Old Lace\"). Sidney hasn't<br />\nhad a hit play in years. So when<br />\nan admiring young playwright<br />\nasks him for help with his new<br />\nplay, Sid greedily accepts. Cliff<br />\n(Jason Hanson, who played<br />\nTheseus in 1985's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\")comes over<br />\nwith a play entitled Deathtrap,<br />\nand it is brilliant. Sidney plots to<br />\nkill Cliff and claim the play as his<br />\nown. Only three things stand in<br />\nhis way: Cliff, who may or may<br />\nnot be trying to kill him; Sidney's<br />\ndisapproving wife Myra (Sharon<br />\nBhagwan, whom you may<br />\nremember from last year's<br />\nFreshman One-Acts); and Helga<br />\nTandorp (Kerry Tesoriero), the<br />\nnext door neighbor who happens<br /><br />\nto be a famous psychic, and keeps<br />\nbarging in because she \"feels<br />\ndeath in the house.\"<br />\nRounding out the cast is the<br />\nhysterical Jeremy Golub as<br />\nSidney's lawyer. The play is really a series of crosses and doublecrosses, with a surprise ending<br />\nthat reverses all the plot devices<br />\nwhich come before it. Audience<br />\nmembers are asked not to reveal<br />\nthe ending to prospective theatergoers\u2014that's how mysterious it<br />\nis<br />\nThrill to the comedy, the<br />\nmystery and the wonderful sound<br />\neffects (provided by Eric Moyer).<br />\nThe production is directed by<br />\nDavid Deboy, who has directed<br />\nBarnstormer shows for the past<br />\nseveral years. Deathtrap plays<br />\nFriday at 8:00, Saturday at 7:00,<br />\nand Sunday at 8:00 in the L/V<br />\nRoom. Tickets are $3 for students<br />\nand $4 for the general public. Advance tickets are available for $2<br />\nat the Union Desk.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/23<br />\n.....<br /><br />\nSomeone<br />\nnot worth watching<br />\nDirected by Ridley Scott<br />\nThe phrase for the week is leap<br />\no'faith. In Someone to Watch<br />\nOver Me, there seems to have<br />\nbeen lots of editing going on.<br />\nThings are just taken for granted<br />\nwhich shouldn't be, and this<br />\nleaves the film incomplete.<br />\nWe start off at a party at Mike<br />\nKeegan's(Tom Berenger). He's<br />\njust been promoted to detective<br />\nand the scene is homey and happy, full of cops being \"human.\"<br />\nThen we switch to a hip'n'cool<br />\nparty where everyone's in<br />\nblack\u2014Christian Dior black. Lots<br />\nof white strobes and smoke. This<br />\nis Claire's(Mimi Rogers) scene.<br />\nIn the basement of this place is a<br />\nmarble art gallery/swimming<br />\npool, and there, Claire witnesses<br />\na murder. Mike is selected to be<br />\nClaire's bodyguard. Now we shift<br />\ninto rich girl/poor boy dynamics<br />\nwith contrast between Mike's<br />\nQueens life with his wife Ellie<br />\n(Lorraine Bracco) and his kid,<br />\nand Claire's cool, marble<br />\nManhattan life. Sometimes this is<br />\nclumsily done: Mike is unable to<br />\ncomplete even one Daily News<br />\ncrossword; Claire's token<br />\nboyfriend is a two-dimensional<br />\nrich jerk/nerd.<br />\nThere is this attraction between<br />\nClaire and Mike yet we cannot<br />\nwork out where this sprung from.<br />\nThey have only said about three<br />\nwords to each other. Meaningful<br />\nglances do not make for<br />\nchemistry. In fact, they seem to<br />\npicture one another as absolute<br />\nstereotypes: \"You must own a<br />\ndog, Mike, living in Queens and<br />\nbeing happily married.\" Well,<br /><br />\nfine, we leap, and assume the<br />\nscene where they did have a real<br />\nconversation was cut. Now we<br />\nare introduced to Claire's big<br />\ndilemma. She has to decide<br />\nwhether she wants to testify<br />\nagainst a killer who could get her<br />\nwhen he gets out of jail. This<br />\nmakes her cry a lot. So the bad<br />\nguy jumps in, to bother Claire,<br />\nand Mike protects her in his<br />\nQueens way, and their \"love\" is<br />\nconsummated. Mike is now torn<br />\nbetween this attraction he has for<br />\nClaire, this urge to protect her,<br />\nand then his loyalty to his good<br />\n'n'happy relationship with his<br />\nwife Ellie. We doodle along here,<br />\nwaiting for the bad guy to come<br />\nin again, and bring some tension<br />\ninto the game. He had initially<br />\ncome off as powerful cruel<br />\nmafioso, but by this point the bad<br />\nguy is just a sweaty Italian<br />\npsychopath. He finally does<br />\nsomething, but it is something<br />\ntotally absurd. He takes Mike's<br />\nfamily hostage. Why, we ask,<br />\nwould any real bad guy go to a<br />\ncop's house (when he's hiding<br />\nfrom the police), and invent this<br />\nhokey hostage trade-off? The leap<br />\no'faith is a lot more difficult to<br />\ntake here, and eventually we just<br />\nend up fed a mealy predictable<br />\nend.<br />\nHmmmm. The tension seems<br />\nto arise between Mike's relationship with his secure sharp-shooter<br />\nwife, and the quivering-lower-liptear-drop-on-the-cheek Claire. It<br />\nalso could be a film about loyalty to the job or loyalty to the<br />\nheart. Or, perhaps, something<br />\nabout how we all want someone<br />\nto protect us? None of these<br /><br />\nthemes is ever actually completed, and with all that leaping,<br />\nwe get tired very fast.<br />\nBerenger as Mike is good.<br />\nWell, he's down-to-earth and<br />\nvery humane, perhaps excessively so. He seems to be uncomfortable being a tough guy. He does<br />\nwell in the sensitive-and-notafraid-to-cry department, and that<br />\nis where we like him' best.<br />\nRogers' Claire is a shallow rich<br />\ngirl with nice clothes, and most<br />\nof her acting seems to have to do<br />\nwith crying, looking afraid, and<br />\nlooking vulnerable in a preppy<br />\nway. Ellie is by far the most interesting character, Bracco plays<br />\nher with endearing common sense<br />\nand courage.<br />\nRidley Scott, known for Alien<br />\nand Blade Runner, switches<br />\nfrom the warm beige tones in the<br />\ndomestic Queens scenes, and then<br />\nto deep blue shadows and white<br />\nspots in the Manhattan scenes.<br />\nHis New York is empty, with lots<br />\nof buildings, late nights, and early<br />\nmornings with no one out. The<br />\nelevator seems to prevail as the<br />\nsymbol of the day, followed<br />\nclosely by the almost overbearing<br />\nuse of steam imagery. And then<br />\nthere are the tears of course, lots<br />\nof tears.<br />\nBesides the likeable characters,<br />\nwith which one can identify in a<br />\ngeneral way, the rest of the film<br />\nseems incomplete. So much has<br />\nto be take for granted, and since<br />\nthere doesn't seem to be any<br />\nstrong theme carrying us through,<br />\nit hardly seems worth all the leaping and the faith.<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nNote: If you wish to be included<br />\nin the Arts Calendar, get your information into the News-Letter by<br />\nMonday at 5:00 p.m. for that Friday's issue, care of the Arts<br />\nEditor.<br /><br />\nFILM<br /><br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series<br />\npresents Desperately Seeking<br />\nSusan.

On any given night, you<br />\ncan hear Tom Petty, Skynnard,<br />\nand a whole host of other hardboiled rockers screaming from a<br />\ncar radio. And, if you go to a bar,<br />\nchances are that you'll hear the<br />\nsame thing live. All this music<br />\ncomes from the same kind of<br />\nroots, tough American blues<br />\nslammed out on makeshift<br />\nacoustic instruments on back porches. Nowadays things have gotten a lot more sophisticated, and<br />\ngarages substitue for porches.<br />\nAnd, while the bar bands survive,<br />\nthey don't do much anymore\u2014<br />\nmost are content to do covers of<br />\n\"Freebird\" for the rest of their<br />\ncareers.<br />\nSometime back in the late<br />\nSeventies/early Eighties, the punk<br />\nmovement spawned something<br />\nnew\u2014cow-punk. This genre had<br />\nthe same intensity and roots as the<br />\nSouthern rockers, but they were<br />\nless concerned with having the<br />\ngood ol' boy party time as<br />\nrevitalizing a kind of music that<br />\nseemed to be on its last legs.<br />\nAs his new album title, High<br />\nPriest, would seem to indicate,<br />\nAlex Chilton might well be the<br />\nleader of this whole mob. Bands<br />\nsuch as REM, the dB's, Dumptruck, and Game Theory count<br />\nhim as a major influence, and The<br />\nReplacements even have a song<br />\ncalled \"Alex Chilton\" on their<br />\nlatest album.<br />\nAlex Chilton sounds a lot like<br />\na Memphis-raised version of Lou<br />\nReed who listened to a lot of<br />\nblues/R&amp;B/gospel music when he<br />\nwas a kid. He's got that kind of<br />\nvoice, you know, the kind that<br />\ncan make even something like<br />\n\"Volare\" sound incredibly cool.<br />\nChilton's style is sparse, uncluttered, simple, in a way that all<br />\nblues music should be. Most of<br />\nthis album is covers of old<br />\nblues/gospel tunes, and I'm sure<br />\nthe former artists would appreciate Chilton's respectful<br />\ntreatment of their creations.<br />\nChilton gives us a few of his own<br /><br />\nGallant, they will perform works<br />\nby Mozart and Brahms.

Truly a<br />\nmind-altering experience. If you<br />\nwant some incredibly cool music,<br />\nthis is it.<br />\nThis previous discussion might<br />\ngive you an idea of what Dumptruck sounds like. It's not hard to<br />\nhear the Chiltonesque influences<br />\nin their songs, but Dumptruck<br />\ntakes things one step further, constructing much more complex<br />\nmelodies with the slightest tinge<br />\nof southern guitar\u2014something<br />\nthat's very odd, since these guys<br />\ncome from Boston. Their new<br />\nalbum,for the country, can best<br />\nbe described with the refrain from<br />\nthe title track\u2014'drifting on an<br />\nocean', in this case, an aural one.<br />\nProducer Hugh Jones puts us into melody-land, each track<br />\ncarefully layered and constructed<br />\nto be as nice as possible. Result:<br />\nlots of pretty, somewhat moody<br />\nmusic. The trouble is, all the<br />\ntracks begin to sound the same<br />\nafter a while\u2014nice, but the same.<br />\nIt would be nice, for example, if<br />\nin \"Island,\" the chorus of 'Get<br />\noff my island' was just a little<br />\nmeaner, and if the guitar solo was<br />\na little bit stronger in the mix.<br />\nThe same might be said of \"50<br />\nmiles,\" which could be an incredibly brutal song if it weren't<br />\nsweetened up so much. The fault<br />\nin this album, for a change, isn't<br />\nwith the group, which can quite<br />\nclearly do most anything they<br />\nwant, but with the producer,<br />\nwhose European style of production doesn't seem to really work<br />\nfor a band with this kind of<br />\nbackground.<br />\nOkay, next week, Part II: The<br />\nHard Rockers.<br />\nPublic Service Announcement<br />\n(with guitars): Student Bands: Let<br />\nus know when and where you<br />\nhave gigs, so that we can get it<br />\ninto the arts calendar and possibly<br />\ngive you coverage.

One of<br />\nthese possibilties is making use of<br />\npassive solar heating. The sun<br />\nradiates tremendous amounts of<br />\nenergy that can be harnessed by<br />\npeople to cut the cost of heating<br />\ntheir homes. Incorporating solar<br />\ndesign into the interior and exterior construction of a house can<br />\nmake the home cheaper and more<br />\nenjoyable to the family living in<br />\nit.<br /><br />\nBuilding<br />\nOrientation<br /><br />\nLocation<br /><br />\nWith most of the sun's heat<br />\ncoming from the south, east, and<br />\nwest, it is best to arrange the<br />\nrooms of the house to utilize the<br />\nheat most efficiently. Facing<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nThe most important factor in<br />\nbuilding a solar home is choosing<br />\nthe correct building location.<br />\nSunny regions with a minimum<br />\nblockage of the low winter sun<br />\nare prime choices. In the winter,<br />\nthe sun rises in the southeast,<br /><br />\ntravels across southern sky, and<br />\nsets in the southwest. Because or<br />\nthis, the best location for a house<br />\nis at the north end of the sunny<br />\narea. This insures that plenty of<br />\nsun reaches the house, and it<br />\nleaves room for outside recreation areas and gardens to be in<br />\nlighted areas.<br />\nAdvantages of solar heat are<br />\nmaximized when there is a<br />\nminimum loss of heat in the<br />\nwinter and a minimum gain in the<br />\nsummer. A home with a low of<br />\nsouth-facing glass that is<br />\nelongated in the east-west direction will expose more surface<br />\narea to the sun's radiation than<br />\nany other design. The north side<br />\nof the building receives almost no<br />\nradiation during the summer or<br />\nwinter. In the winter, the south<br />\nside receives about three times as<br />\nmuch radiation as the east and<br />\nwest sides. Conversely, in the<br />\nsummer, the east side, roof, and<br />\nwest side receive almost three<br />\ntimes as much as the south side.<br />\nTherefore, a home located in the<br />\neast-west direction with a maximum southern exposure and a<br />\nminumum east-west exposure<br />\nreceives large doses of solar heat<br />\nin the winter and minimizes solar<br />\nheating in the summer.<br /><br />\nRoom Design<br /><br />\ndirectly south should be rooms<br />\nthat require the most heating and<br />\nlighting. This is the place for the<br />\nliving and dining rooms because<br />\nthey're continually used during<br />\nthe day. It is important to note<br />\nthat rooms exposed to the sun<br />\nshouldn't exceed a depth two and<br />\none-half times the height of the<br />\nwindows from the floor. The<br />\naverage window is seven feet<br />\nfrom the floor, so the depth<br />\nshouldn't be greater than 18 feet.<br />\nThis allows the whole room to be<br />\npenetrated by the sun.<br />\nLocation of rooms in the east<br />\nand west portions of the house<br />\ndepends on the living style of the<br />\nfamily. The key to remember is<br />\nthat the east section is warmest in<br />\nthe morning, and the west portion<br />\nis warmest in the late afternoon<br />\nand evening. One possibility<br />\nwould be to have the kitchen in<br />\nthe east, if that's where breakfast<br />\nis eaten, and to have a craft room<br />\nin the west corner since it would<br />\nprobably be used in the evening<br />\nhours.<br />\nSpacing that needs a minimum<br />\nof light and heat would be located<br />\nalong the north side of the house.<br />\nHallways, stairs, closets, utility<br />\nrooms, and garages fall into this<br />\ncategory. These rooms also serve<br />\nas an insulating buffer between<br />\nthe used areas and the cold north<br />\nwall. An entrance can also be<br />\nlocated on this side as long as it<br />\nhas an insulating door between it<br /><br />\nand the rest of the house. The inside door prevents cold air from<br />\nentering the whole house when<br />\nthe outside door is open.<br />\nEven if the rooms are layed out<br />\nto take advantage of the sun, the<br />\nhouse won't be heated properly<br />\nunless the windows are located<br />\ncorrectly. The logic for their<br />\nlocation is straightforward. The<br />\nside with the southern exposure<br />\nshould have the most glazing to<br />\nget as much solar benefit as possible. Moving to the east and west<br />\nside, the amount of glass should<br />\nbe reduced. If a large section of<br />\nglass is used, more heat would be<br />\nlose than gained. Finally, a<br />\nminimum amount of glass should<br />\nbe used on the north wall because<br />\nit receives almost no solar radiation and it faces the cold winter<br />\nwinds.<br /><br />\na small shadow, along with some<br />\ntrees to break the north winds,<br />\nwill expand the enjoyable area of<br />\nthe lawn.<br /><br />\nA Traditional Home with Solar<br />\nDesign<br /><br />\nnorth side. Upstairs are the<br />\nbedrooms. These don't have as<br />\nmuch glazing as the first floor,<br />\nbut still benefit from the southern<br />\nexposure.<br />\nLike the Saltbox, other homes<br />\ncan be designed to be solar efficient. Remembering that the sun<br />\nshines from the south in the<br />\nwinter and from above in the<br />\nsummer is the key to successful<br />\nhouse design. The final product<br />\nis a reflection of the family's<br />\ntastes, and can make living at<br />\nhome pleasant and efficient.<br /><br />\nMany homes incorporate solar<br />\ndesigns. One such home is the<br />\ntraditional Saltbox style house (a<br />\ntwo story house with a roof that<br />\nslopes to one story). The twostory side faces south and the onestory side faces north. The slope<br />\ncreates a small shadow on the<br />\nnorth lawn, and most of the glass<br />\nis on the south side. Inside, the<br />\nfirst floor has a kitchen, dining,<br />\nliving and family room along the<br />\nsoutheast, south and southwest<br />\nsections. Utilities, closets, and a<br />\nprotected entrance are on the<br /><br />\nExterior Design<br /><br />\nHaving the rooms and windows<br />\nlocated correctly will make an<br /><br />\nHopkins treats<br />\nWomen's health<br />\nCourtesy JHMI<br /><br />\nimprovement in the heating efficiency of a home. The same principle for interior design can also<br />\nbe applied to the exterior. People<br />\nwant to be in the bright, warm<br />\nsun. Recall that the building is<br />\nlocated at the north end of a sunny area. The south, east, and west<br />\nsection of lawn receive sun.<br />\nThese are excellent areas for<br />\nrecreation, but, unless the north<br />\nwall of the house is designed properly, the north lawn will be in<br />\nthe shadows and nobody will<br />\nwant to use it.

Sean Bramble<br />\nIt's Hot Stove League time approaching, so keep this article<br />\nhandy as a reference when you<br />\nand your friends start arguing<br />\nabout baseball's annual awards<br />\nshow. Here's the picks as I see<br />\nthem:<br />\nAL CY YOUNG\u2014No one else<br />\nin the league deserves this award<br />\nbut Roger Clemens. You know<br />\nhe's a premier pitcher when he<br />\nskips a month of the season and<br />\nstill dominates the league. Sure,<br />\nJimmy Key led the league with a<br />\n2.76 ERA, but Clemens finished<br />\nclose behind with a 2.97 figure.<br />\nHe also led the majors handily in<br />\nboth shutouts and complete<br />\ngames. He was second in the AL<br />\nin both innings pitched and<br />\nstrikeouts, plus he was one of only two twenty-game winners in<br /><br />\nthe majors. How can this man not<br />\nwin the Cy Young?<br />\nNL CY YOUNG\u2014I agree with<br />\nMurray Chass; Ryan was obviously the best pitcher in the NL<br />\nlast year. Yes, I know he finished 8-16, but it wasn't his fault.<br />\nCan you blame Ryan simply<br />\nbecause the Astro offense doesn't<br />\nknow in which direction home<br />\nplate lies? Ryan had the best ERA<br />\nand, at the age of 40, set the alltime record for strikeouts per nine<br />\ninnings pitched (the record being<br />\nset, incidentally, by a 19 year-old<br />\nnamed Dwight Gooden). Besides,<br />\ngiving the award to Ryan would<br />\ngo a long way towards rectifying<br />\nall of those Cy Youngs given to<br />\nmediocre pitchers who posted<br />\nflashy won-lost records, just<br />\nbecause the team scored lots of<br />\nruns for them\u2014people like Pete<br />\nVuckovick and LaMarr Hoyt.<br /><br />\nAL MVP\u2014This shouldn't be<br />\nall that hard of a pick, actually.<br />\nI think George Bell will win it,<br />\nbut I really believe Alan Trammell deserves it. Alan Trammell's numbers are actually better than Bell's (despite George's<br />\n47 homers), plus he was Alan<br />\nTrammell on defense\u2014he's not<br />\nOzzie at shortstop, but he's not<br />\nGreg Gagne, either. If Trammell<br />\ndoes win it, though, it will be the<br />\nsixth time in the last seven years<br />\nthat the AL has had either a pitcher or a shortstop for an MVP.<br />\nNL MVP\u2014This will be the<br />\nfree-for-all in the awards voting.<br />\nPeople like Dawson, Clark,<br />\nStrawberry, Gwynn, Raines, and<br />\neven Schmidt have a chance. Personally, I'd name Eric Davis<br />\nMVP. He's kind of been forgotten since the Reds did their Greg<br />\nLouganis imitation, but no one<br /><br />\nMonday, October 26. The conditioning will consist of swimming,<br />\nweightlifting, and some throwing. Practice for pitchers and catchers begins on the. first day of<br />\nthe second semester, January 25.<br />\nAll other players begin practice<br />\ntwo weeks later.<br />\nWhen interviewed, Coach<br />\nBabb was very optimistic about<br />\nthe 1987-88 baseball team. According to Babb, Hopkins has a<br />\nvery young team for the first time<br />\nin many years. There are only six<br />\nseniors on this year's team. They<br />\nwill be expected to provide<br />\nleadership for a team consisting<br />\nlargely of sophomores and<br />\nfreshmen. Despite their youth,<br />\nBabb believes the team will once<br />\nagain be favored to win their<br />\nleague, the MAC Southeast. Based on the fall season, Babb said<br />\nHopkins will be competitive and<br /><br />\nable to score runs this spring. The<br />\ntop two pitchers, Dave Psenicska<br />\nand Jason Klitenic, looked better<br />\nthan last year. However, what<br />\nwill determine whether the Jays<br />\nare very good or merely average<br />\nwill be the performance of their<br />\nnumber three, four, and five pitchers. \"We have some young pitchers who showed the potential to<br />\nfill in the number three, four, and<br />\nfive slots,\" said Babb.<br />\nThe Jays open their spring<br />\nseason with several tough games<br />\nagainst Division I and II opponenets and a team that played<br />\nin the Division III World Series<br />\nlast year. The team will also be<br />\ntraveling to Florida over Spring<br />\nBreak to play games, both in<br />\nFlorida and on the trip down.<br />\nBabb is also planning to play the<br />\nCuban national team in Memorial<br />\nStadium this spring.<br /><br />\nelse in the league has his combination of power (37 homers)<br />\nand speed (50 stolen bases). Sure,<br />\nJack Clark provided the jet start<br />\nto get the Cardinals into the<br />\nplayoffs, but don't forget that<br />\nDavis nearly did the same thing<br />\nfor the Reds. Clark just had a lot<br />\nmore assistance. Besides, if<br />\nWhitey had had the chance to<br />\ntrade Clark even up for Davis,<br />\ndon't you think he would have<br />\ndone so?<br />\nAL ROOKIE\u2014It's a foregone<br />\nconclusion that Mark McGwire<br />\nwill be named Rookie of the<br />\nYear. I would like to see Keven<br />\nSeitzer win it, though, as I think<br />\nhe will go on to be the better of<br /><br />\nthe two.
