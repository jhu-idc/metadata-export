Armbruster is editor of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Magazine, one of the<br />\nbest alumni publications in the<br />\nnation.<br />\n\"I get impatient at times with the<br />\nacademic types, their arrogance,<br />\ntheir 'we-know-it-and- they-don't'<br />\nattitude.

Sure there's a generation gap,<br />\nbut so what?\"<br />\nThe gap that worries Armbruster<br />\nIs between the alumni and their<br />\nalrna-mater. \"All we can do is give<br />\n<br />\nthem a tiny example of what<br />\nHopkins is; to try and make it seem<br />\nhuman.\" The Magazine tries to<br />\nmake real \u2022to a far-removed and<br />\nincredibly diverse readership the<br />\nproblems not only of students but<br />\nalso of faculty and administrators.<br />\n\"We want them to form their own<br />\nopinions about the nature of the<br />\nplace.\"<br />\nFrom his office on Charles Street,<br />\nArmbruster has probably dusted out<br />\nas many corners of the University<br />\nas anyone. \"I'm optimistic. about<br />\nHopkins and about the country.<br />\nThough I have mixed feelings about<br />\nthem, the students at Hopkins are<br />\ninterested in the right things,<br />\nneedles in the right<br />\nsticking<br />\nplaces.\"<br />\nArmbruster describes himself as a<br />\nliberal Democratic. \"I have faith in<br />\nthe system, otherwise I wouldn't be<br />\nan editor.\" And indeed Armbruster<br />\ndoes have most of the trappings of<br />\nmiddle America. But his easy going<br />\ninformality belies the fact that he<br />\nfits few of the stereotypes of the<br />\nstraight world.<br />\nAfter graduating from Beloit<br />\nCollege, in 1956, Armbruster spent 9<br />\nmonths working for Bell Telephone.<br />\n\"I hated it.

But more importantly, this plan also permits students to drop or<br />\npass-fail their C, D, or F courses--all in the name of a<br />\nhigher grade point average. And to top it off, all this<br />\nscholastic maneuvering would never show up<br />\nstudents' academic records.<br />\nSure it's fine to say, as the Honor Commission has,<br />\nthat it is hypocritical to grade students, but once<br />\nstudents accept the system by enrolling it is equally<br />\nhypocritical to whizzle out grades they don't deserve.<br />\nIdeas which take off the traditional burden of<br />\nstiltified educational teaching are welcome; the<br />\nHonor Commission's recommendation to initiate<br />\nunlimited pass-fail is in keeping with allowing the<br />\nstudent complete freedom in his course work.

A Marine's Diary<br />\nOnce upon a time students were upset about<br />\nmilitary recruiting. They voted it off campus and<br />\nthey wanted it kept off. Then came summer and then<br />\ncame fall...<br />\nCarefully, I collected my flags, my briefcase--there<br />\nwere 20 of them with signs. A man named Bilgrave<br />\nmet me at the car and he said not to worry, that these<br />\nkids were always demonstrating about something but<br />\nnever did anything about it. He said he remembered<br />\nonce that 500 of them were taking over the administration building and left when he told them it<br />\nwas illegal.<br />\nThey gave me their handbills--we're told to accept<br />\nthem--and engaged me with meaningful dialogue. I'd<br />\nheard about what they were trying to do. They were<br />\ntrying to win over a member of the working class. I<br />\ngot inside and set up my flags and arranged my<br />\ncopies of \"Stag\" and \"How to Talk to Anybody About<br />\nPractically Anything.\"<br />\nI called up some friends at the ROTC building and I<br />\ncalled up my wife and I called up the cafeteria for<br />\nsome lunch. I looked outside. It was a nice day.<br />\n...Military recruiting was banned the day nobody<br />\ncame.<br />\n<br />\nBasics of Governance<br />\nBy J. WOODFORD HOWARD<br />\nand STEWART HULSE<br />\nThe governance committee was charged<br />\nto \"design a more effective system of<br />\ngovernance\" for the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences. To further understanding of the<br />\nreport in the light of the reactions we have<br />\nheard since the report appeared, we desire<br />\nto underscore certain major principles<br />\nunderlying the proposals as we comprehend<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe basic assumption of the majority<br />\nreport is that the central purpose of the<br />\nDivision is acquisition and expansion of<br />\nknowledge -- not campus politics. Consequently, the majority rejected various<br />\nproposals for government by town-meeting<br />\nor representative parliament and adopted<br />\nthe principle of accountable administration,<br />\nas suggested by President Kingman<br />\nBrewster of Yale.<br />\nAccording to Brewster, there are two<br />\nreasons why a parliamentary body is<br />\ninappropriate to university governance.<br />\nFirst, decision-making by Democratic<br />\nrepresentatives of all elements in a<br />\ndiverse university is apt to be too<br />\nslow and ineffective to meet the<br />\ndemands for prompt and flexible<br />\nleadership rising from many quarters.<br />\nSecond, decision-making by a representative parliament would inevitably subordinate learning to campus politics for large<br />\nnumbers -- and, we would add, create in<br />\npractice a new class of transient oligarchs no<br />\nless difficult to control than a few visible<br />\nadministrators. Experiments on other<br />\ncampuses confirm these difficulties. Thus<br />\nwe concluded that what Hopkins needs is<br />\nneither cooption of administrative authority<br />\nby faculty and students nor an unwieldy<br />\nlegislature. What Hopkins needs are<br />\nmechanisms to make administrative<br />\nauthority more responsive, responsible, and<br />\ntherefore supportable.<br />\nHight to Participate<br />\nThough the concept of accountability may<br />\nsound fancy, the idea is simple. If consistently with their educational goals faculty<br />\n<br />\nand students- cannot directly govern the<br />\nuniversity, they can and should have the<br />\nright to participate in the selection of major<br />\nadministrative officials, the right to be informed and consulted about policies affecting their vital interests, the right to<br />\nexplanation of decisions reached, and the<br />\nright to periodic review of performance in<br />\norder to register or withhold their confidence. Otherwise, responsible administrators cannot reasonably expect their<br />\ncooperation and sustained support.<br />\nOur proposals seek to implement the<br />\nprinciple of accountable administration in<br />\nthree ways:<br />\n(1) creation of more representative advisory bodies, (e.g., the ASRC, the judicial<br />\ninstitutions, etc.);<br />\n(2) clarification and realignment of functions, (e.g., the transfer of all nonacademic<br />\nmatters from the Academic Council to the<br />\nASRC); and<br />\n(3) recognition of administrative and<br />\ndepartmental guidelines as customary<br />\nstandards of participation and conduct to<br />\ninsure more effective communication,<br />\nconsultation, and cooperation. It should be<br />\nstressed that these guidelines, which range<br />\nfrom fixed terms of service to guaranteed<br />\nfiscal information to advisory bodies, are<br />\nintegral to the proposed design. Different<br />\nstructures might well have been recommended without them. Particular proposals<br />\nregarding structure and functions should<br />\ntherefore be read with the guidelines in<br />\nmind.<br />\nWeighted Interests<br />\nAnother principle underlying the report is<br />\norganization according to weighted interests. Each major element of the Division - faculty, students, professional research<br />\nstaff, etc. -- is recognized to have areas of<br />\nexclusive jurisdiction, dominant jurisdiction, and overlapping jurisdiction. For<br />\nexample, the faculty have primary<br />\nresponsibility for academic programs, while<br />\nstudents dominate extra-curricular activities. The faculty have exclusive advisory<br />\nauthority over faculty personnel matters,<br />\n(continued on page 8)<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nThe Disfranchised<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIf we are going to have<br />\nanother referendum on the<br />\nsubject of military recruiting<br />\non campus, how about letting<br />\nthe research assistants,<br />\nresearch associates, and<br />\npostdoctoral students vote<br />\nthis time?

The ASRC will<br />\nbe the central advisory organ<br />\nin all nonacademic affairs of<br />\ncampus-wide concern; it has<br />\npower to constitute committees according to the<br />\nsame weighting principle; it<br />\nwill play a key role in the<br />\namending process; it has<br />\nimportant responsibilities in<br />\ndeveloping codes of conduct<br />\nand<br />\nfair<br />\ndisciplinary<br />\nprocedures.<br />\nThe most difficult problems<br />\nin applying the weighting<br />\nprinciple were academic<br />\nprograms and discipline.<br />\nResolutions of the General<br />\nAssembly and the Academic<br />\nCouncil made plain that the<br />\nfaculty regarded academic<br />\nprograms as their responsibility. Polls taken last<br />\nspring revealed that students<br />\nalso wished to influence,<br />\nthough not necessarily<br />\ncontrol, those decisions. After<br />\ngrappling with this conflict,<br />\nwe finally settled on a<br />\ncompromise containing these<br />\nelements:<br />\nRight to Consult<br />\n<br />\n(1) faculty are recognized<br />\nto have final advisory<br />\n<br />\nauthority over academic<br />\nprograms; students are<br />\nrecognized to have the rights<br />\nto propose, to be informed<br />\nand consulted, and to receive<br />\nconcerning<br />\nexplanations<br />\ncurriculum at both ASRC and<br />\ndepartmental levels;<br />\n(2) at central levels,<br />\nstudents are also guaranteed<br />\non<br />\nthe<br />\nrepresentation<br />\nworking committees of the<br />\nAcademic Council -- i.e., the<br />\nCommittee on Unjergraduate<br />\nStudies, the Graduate Board,<br />\nand the interlocking Committee on Instruction, which<br />\nwas designed to meet broader<br />\nproblems of planning a<br />\ncoordination; and<br />\n(3) departmental<br />\nguidelines<br />\nguarantee<br />\nstudents a mechanism to<br />\nrepresent their views to<br />\ndepartments, where most<br />\ncurriculum matters are<br />\ngenerated and resolved. The<br />\nguidelines also guarantee<br />\njunior faculty, for the first<br />\ntime, full participation in<br />\ndepartmental policy-making<br />\nexcept for the determination<br />\nof individual salaries and<br />\npromotions to rank higher<br />\nthan one's own.<br />\nThe question of discipline is<br />\nso complex that comment<br />\nmust be restricted to a few<br />\nsalient points. The committee<br />\nwould have gladly ducked the<br />\nissue but for the feeling that it<br />\nwas too critical for postponement. Constraints of<br />\ntime limited our proposals to<br />\ninstitutions. Codes of conduct<br />\nand fair procedure were left<br />\nto the ASRC representatives<br />\nand in the interim to the dean<br />\nalone.

Frankly, we find it<br />\nhard to imagine that a dean<br />\nwould be so impolitic as to<br />\noverrule consistently the<br />\nresponsible judgments of<br />\nhearing and appeals boards<br />\ncomposed as recommended.<br />\nAnswer to Critics<br />\nThis issue relates to two<br />\ncriticisms of the majority<br />\nreport we would like to answer in closing. The most<br />\ncommonly heard student<br />\ncriticism is that the proposed<br />\nmechanism is merely advisory and thus offers<br />\nstudents no \"real\" power.<br />\nThis criticism, in our view,<br />\nstems from an overly formalistic view of power.<br />\nTechnically, all power on this<br />\nthe<br />\ncampus<br />\nexcept<br />\nPresident's is advisory and<br />\nthe \u2022President, for that<br />\nmatter, serves at the<br />\npleasure of the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nTerm Explained<br />\nIt is in this technical sense<br />\n<br />\nthat the committee has used<br />\nthe term \"advisory-\" To<br />\nadvise, as we viewed it, is not<br />\nto proffer statements to a<br />\nfaculty<br />\ncondescending<br />\nmember, dean , or other<br />\nadministrator who may or<br />\nmay not listen according to<br />\npersonal whim. To advise is<br />\nnot just to inform, though it is<br />\n<br />\ncertainly that in part. To<br />\nadvise, in its full sense, is to<br />\nconvey pressure for timely<br />\nand responsible action,<br />\npressure which really can<br />\ncome from the resolupions<br />\nand recommendations of<br />\nrepresentative organizations<br />\nacting in good faith and with<br />\ndue deliberation.<br />\nDe Facto Influence<br />\nOver the years several<br />\nadvisory bodies -- the<br />\nAcademic Council, the Honor<br />\nCommission, the Committee<br />\non Academic Standing -- have<br />\ndeveloped such de facto influence to the point that their<br />\ndecisions are seldom if ever<br />\noverruled. We see no reason<br />\nwhy a similar relationship<br />\ncannot develop for the ASRC,<br />\nespecially since its advice<br />\nwill be jointly rendered and<br />\nrepresentative.<br />\nWhom do you Trust?<br />\n<br />\nStudents also respond that<br />\nthe administration and<br />\nfaculty cannot be trusted to<br />\npermit de facto influence to<br />\ndevelop. The short answer is<br />\na question: whom do you<br />\ntrust? No government can<br />\nwait for perfect trust.<br />\nResponsible governments are<br />\ncontrolled by some system of<br />\n<br />\naccountability. We have<br />\npopular<br />\nthe<br />\nrejected<br />\nassembly method of accountability because we think<br />\nthe vast majority of students<br />\nand faculty feel they have<br />\nbetter things to do than<br />\nbecome \"campus polls.\"<br />\nMore Responsive<br />\nWe have proposed a difof acferent system<br />\ncountability which relies on<br />\nimproved advisory bodies<br />\nplus guidelines.

Comissiona is<br />\ncertainly one of the most<br />\nexciting conductors on the<br />\npodium today, and his<br />\nopening performance again<br />\nreaffirmed the fact that<br />\nBaltimore is indeed lucky to<br />\npossess his talents.<br />\nVirtuosity<br />\nThe remainder of the<br />\nprogram included one of<br />\nAaron Copland's few 12-tone<br />\npieces, \"Inscape\", and the<br />\ngay \"Roman Festivals\" by<br />\nMr.<br />\nAgain,<br />\nRespighi.<br />\nComissiona demonstrated his<br />\nvirtuosity by conducting a<br />\nthoughtful piece of serialistic<br />\nmusic and then switching to a<br />\ntrilogy of tone poems that<br />\nrequired a definite mastery of<br />\norchestral color.<br />\nConsider the Heat<br />\nThe Baltimore Symphony<br />\nalso performed admirably<br />\nconsidering the heat, which<br />\nmust have been unbearable<br />\non stage. It seemed to<br />\nrespond extremely well to<br />\nMr. Comissiona and the orchestra definitely plays with<br />\nmore assurance this year<br />\nthan in the past. There is no<br />\ndoubt that the Lyric theater<br />\nwill present some outstanding<br />\nconcerts this season.<br />\nTwo weeks later, the<br />\nPhiladelphia Orchestra came<br />\nto town with its ailing Music<br />\n<br />\nDirector, Eugene Ormandy,<br />\nat the helm. The program<br />\nthat night consisted of: \"Two<br />\nPortraits\", Op. 5 by Bela<br />\nBartok; \"Symphony No. 7 in<br />\nA Major, Op. 92,\" by<br />\nBeethoven; and \"Symphony<br />\nNo. 5 in B Flat Major, Op.<br />\n100\"by Prokofieff.<br />\nTwo Portraits\"<br />\nMaestro Ormandy is still<br />\nrecovering from hip surgery<br />\nhe underwent early last<br />\nsummer which makes his<br />\nentrances and exits painfully<br />\nslow. Yet when he is on the<br />\npodium, there is little doubt in<br />\nanyone's mind of Ormandy's<br />\ngreatness. He conducts with a<br />\nmeasured simplicity that<br />\nmade<br />\nlast<br />\nTuesday's<br />\nprogram inspiring.<br />\nThe opening piece was<br />\nBartok's \"Two Portraits\",<br />\nthe first of which was<br />\noriginally written as a violin<br />\nconcerto. The piece begins<br />\nand ends with the solo first<br />\nviolin, and Concertmaster<br />\nNorman Carol literally sang<br />\nBartok's lyrical motif. Ormandy enhanced the performance with a directness of<br />\ntempo and a deep understanding of this early<br />\nBartok work which was first<br />\nperformed in the U. S. by<br />\nOrmandy in 1959.<br />\n<br />\nBut it was the Beethoven<br />\nSymphony No. 7 that really<br />\nshowed<br />\nwhat<br />\nthe<br />\nPhiladelphians and Ormandy<br />\ncan do. It was tautly controlled and Ormandy wasted<br />\nlittle effort keeping strict<br />\ntempos throughout. All<br />\ntogether, it was a simple and<br />\nforthright interpretation of a<br />\ntreacherous<br />\npiece<br />\nof<br />\nBeethoven.<br />\nDance Quality<br />\nOrmandy kept the orbalanced<br />\nchestra<br />\nwell<br />\nthrough the first three<br />\nmovements, although the<br />\nAllegro was slightly tilted<br />\ntoward the violins at the<br />\nexpense of the cellos and<br />\nbasses. Yet the dramatic<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nquality<br />\ndance<br />\nmovement was never lost.<br />\nIn the final program<br />\nnumber, the Philadelphia<br />\nOrchestra showed its musical<br />\n<br />\nmuscles<br />\nand<br />\nplayed<br />\nProkofieff's Fifth Symphony<br />\nin a rather straight forward<br />\nfashion. The orchestra was<br />\nsuccessfully guided through<br />\nProkofieff's<br />\nexcess<br />\nof<br />\nmusical verbiage by Mr.<br />\nOrmandy and the tumultuous<br />\naudience response at the<br />\nconclusion was well deserved.<br />\nThe next Philadelphia<br />\nOrchestra program is on Nov.<br />\n24.<br />\n<br />\njEEp<br />\nGo where you've<br />\nnever gone before<br />\n<br />\nHERRING JEEP<br />\n310W. 27th St. 889-1719<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and old<br />\neat at:<br />\n<br />\nPecora's<br />\nRestaurant<br />\nfor the Finest Italian Food in town<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\n<br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\n<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE.<br />\nCALL 889-3831<br />\n<br />\n\fOct. 13, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 10<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jays Lick Bears In Second Big Win<br />\nBy MIKE ANGEL<br />\nIn a hard fought struggle,<br />\nthe Jays emerged victorious,<br />\nbeating the Ursinus Bears 3428 for their second big win.<br />\nHopkins was first to score<br />\nin the game after Jim Mcmenamin had recovered a<br />\nfumble on the Bear's 37 yard<br />\nline, Bob Pfeifer went on to<br />\nhit Bill Donovan with a 23yard touchdown toss.

When that happens, your reading speed<br />\nmay very well decline to its old neighborhood<br />\nof 250 wpm or so.<br />\nHere,then, is the major difference between<br />\nContemporary's read-with-speed course and<br />\nall others:<br />\nWe teach you to pace\u2014not race\u2014yourself<br />\nthrough the things you read at a sensible,<br />\ncomfortable rate.<br />\nWhich means you'll be reading most types of<br />\nmaterial at a rate of 1000 wpm \u2014a healthy four<br />\ntimes faster than most people read.<br />\nBy the time you graduate from our course,<br />\n1000 wpm will be your natural reading speed.<br />\n(Which means you'll probably never go back to<br />\nbeing a 250 wpm weakling again!)<br />\n<br />\n:<br />\n1100,,,,,,flualip<br />\n11111<br />\n\"<br />\n01111111hiodo<br />\n,111..1 ,1 000<br />\nI low<br />\n0111<br />\n4 -ill!<br />\nlow<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n'11111111111\"ffi Illimonoillim0111.0101111\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022.<br />\n\u2022.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n2.

Armbruster is editor of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Magazine, one of the<br />\nbest alumni publications in the<br />\nnation.<br />\n\"I get impatient at times with the<br />\nacademic types, their arrogance,<br />\ntheir 'we-know-it-and- they-don't'<br />\nattitude. But working in a University<br />\naround these people and their ideas,<br />\nhelps to slow the inevitable process<br />\nof stagnation.<br />\nPlaced in the precarious position<br />\nbetween the Univel Ly and its<br />\nalumni, the 36 year-old Armbruster<br />\nknows a great deal about communications gaps. \"I don't understand the students quite often on<br />\na lot of counts, but it doesn't worry \u2022<br />\nme. Sure there's a generation gap,<br />\nbut so what?\"<br />\nThe gap that worries Armbruster<br />\nIs between the alumni and their<br />\nalrna-mater. \"All we can do is give<br /><br />\nthem a tiny example of what<br />\nHopkins is; to try and make it seem<br />\nhuman.\" The Magazine tries to<br />\nmake real \u2022to a far-removed and<br />\nincredibly diverse readership the<br />\nproblems not only of students but<br />\nalso of faculty and administrators.<br />\n\"We want them to form their own<br />\nopinions about the nature of the<br />\nplace.\"<br />\nFrom his office on Charles Street,<br />\nArmbruster has probably dusted out<br />\nas many corners of the University<br />\nas anyone. \"I'm optimistic. about<br />\nHopkins and about the country.<br />\nThough I have mixed feelings about<br />\nthem, the students at Hopkins are<br />\ninterested in the right things,<br />\nneedles in the right<br />\nsticking<br />\nplaces.\"<br />\nArmbruster describes himself as a<br />\nliberal Democratic. \"I have faith in<br />\nthe system, otherwise I wouldn't be<br />\nan editor.\" And indeed Armbruster<br />\ndoes have most of the trappings of<br />\nmiddle America. But his easy going<br />\ninformality belies the fact that he<br />\nfits few of the stereotypes of the<br />\nstraight world.<br />\nAfter graduating from Beloit<br />\nCollege, in 1956, Armbruster spent 9<br />\nmonths working for Bell Telephone.<br />\n\"I hated it. They spent 2 weeks<br /><br />\nBob Irmbruster<br />\nteaching ne how to answer the phone<br />\nlike an executive.\"<br />\nHe found the army as dehumanizing until he lied his way<br />\nonto the post newspaper. \"This was<br />\nmy first taste of journalism and of<br />\nofficial conservatism.\" More of both<br />\nwas to come as Armbruster worked<br /><br />\nin various publicOlons positions in a<br />\npotpourri colleges and universities<br />\nbefore coming to Hopkins in 1968.<br />\n\"The Hopkins Magazine is 1 of the<br />\njobs everybody in the business<br />\nwould like to have. I was lucky to<br />\nget it.\" The Magazine along with<br />\nsimilar publications from Simons<br />\nCollege and Washington University<br />\nwas recently cited by the American<br />\nAlumni Council for continued excellence during the past decade.<br />\nBefore coming here, Armbruster<br />\nspent 4 years as the assistant editor<br />\nof the similar publication at<br />\nWashington University.<br />\n\"Of course I'm not satisfied with<br />\nour work. The 2 previous editors<br />\nhave given us a tough model to live<br />\nup to. I would just like to continue<br />\nthat tradition of excellence.\" During<br />\nthe year it was under Armbruster's<br />\neditorship, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nJournal was adjudged 1 of the top 5<br />\nalumni newspapers in the country.<br />\n\"What I like best about this place<br />\nis that with few exceptions people let<br />\nyou alone to do what you do best.\"<br />\nThat's probably true, though<br />\nArmbruster, who shoots in the mid80's, also enjoys being coach of the<br />\ngolf team. \"I love it.\" His pay is<br />\nseveral dozen golf balls.<br /><br />\nBlack Students Find'Community'atHopkins<br />\n13y MICHAEL WEISSMAN<br />\nIronically black students<br />\nhave accomplished what<br />\nWhites have been unable to<br />\ndo.<br />\nIn keeping with the spirit of<br />\nblack solidarity, they have<br />\ncreated a community here<br />\nWith genuine concern for<br />\ntheir brothers.<br />\n\"We've got to stick<br />\ntogether, or we just won't<br />\nmake it\", asserted Ronald<br />\nfreshman<br />\nJones, a black<br />\nfrom Baltimore.<br />\nA sophomore transfer,<br />\nLarry Dolye, explained the<br /><br />\nEastern High<br />\nstation at<br />\nSchool.<br />\nInstead, he chose to go<br />\ndowntown and work with<br />\nCORE.

The explanation,<br />\naccording to Guess, is the<br />\nlarger black community, with<br />\n30 blacks in the freshman<br />\nclass alone.<br />\nOwens is Assistant Director<br />\nof' Admissions, concentrating<br />\non black recruitment. Black<br />\nstudents rely on Owens for<br />\ncounsel whenever it is<br />\npossible.<br />\nCoupled with Owens' efforts the BSU is actively<br />\nengaged in recruiting black<br />\nstudents.

Greg<br />\nThomas, a junior and cochairman of the BSU said,<br />\n\"The closest a black can live<br />\nto campus is Green Spring<br />\navenue, and that's only if you<br />\nhave a car\".<br />\nTo counter alleged housing<br />\ndiscrimination in the area<br />\nclosest to Hopkins, the BSU<br />\nplans to use legal action<br />\nwhen the students start<br />\nlooking for housing next<br />\nspring.<br />\n114,A:ion-campus housing<br />\ncan ibe d- ifficult too, they said.<br />\n\"Roommate compatibility is<br /><br />\ncomputed on white cultural<br />\nsaid Dale<br />\nstandards\"<br />\nSaunders, a black freshman<br />\nin the dorms.

The Honor Commission's new recommendations tread precariously<br />\nclose to sanctioning official abuse of the academic<br />\nfreedoms Hopkins offers its students.<br />\nThe Commission's main suggestion would permit<br />\nstudents to drop or pass-fail any course up to the first<br />\nday of classes the following semester--all in the name<br />\nof lessening academic pressure. But more importantly, this plan also permits students to drop or<br />\npass-fail their C, D, or F courses--all in the name of a<br />\nhigher grade point average. And to top it off, all this<br />\nscholastic maneuvering would never show up<br />\nstudents' academic records.<br />\nSure it's fine to say, as the Honor Commission has,<br />\nthat it is hypocritical to grade students, but once<br />\nstudents accept the system by enrolling it is equally<br />\nhypocritical to whizzle out grades they don't deserve.<br />\nIdeas which take off the traditional burden of<br />\nstiltified educational teaching are welcome; the<br />\nHonor Commission's recommendation to initiate<br />\nunlimited pass-fail is in keeping with allowing the<br />\nstudent complete freedom in his course work. But to<br />\nallow students to pervert the system for a better<br />\ngrade will ultimately cheapen the school, the ideals<br />\nof receiving an education and the student himself.<br /><br />\nDay in the Life:<br />\n... A Marine's Diary<br />\nOnce upon a time students were upset about<br />\nmilitary recruiting. They voted it off campus and<br />\nthey wanted it kept off. Then came summer and then<br />\ncame fall...<br />\nCarefully, I collected my flags, my briefcase--there<br />\nwere 20 of them with signs. A man named Bilgrave<br />\nmet me at the car and he said not to worry, that these<br />\nkids were always demonstrating about something but<br />\nnever did anything about it. He said he remembered<br />\nonce that 500 of them were taking over the administration building and left when he told them it<br />\nwas illegal.<br />\nThey gave me their handbills--we're told to accept<br />\nthem--and engaged me with meaningful dialogue. I'd<br />\nheard about what they were trying to do. They were<br />\ntrying to win over a member of the working class. I<br />\ngot inside and set up my flags and arranged my<br />\ncopies of \"Stag\" and \"How to Talk to Anybody About<br />\nPractically Anything.\"<br />\nI called up some friends at the ROTC building and I<br />\ncalled up my wife and I called up the cafeteria for<br />\nsome lunch. I looked outside. It was a nice day.<br />\n...Military recruiting was banned the day nobody<br />\ncame.<br /><br />\nBasics of Governance<br />\nBy J. WOODFORD HOWARD<br />\nand STEWART HULSE<br />\nThe governance committee was charged<br />\nto \"design a more effective system of<br />\ngovernance\" for the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences. To further understanding of the<br />\nreport in the light of the reactions we have<br />\nheard since the report appeared, we desire<br />\nto underscore certain major principles<br />\nunderlying the proposals as we comprehend<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe basic assumption of the majority<br />\nreport is that the central purpose of the<br />\nDivision is acquisition and expansion of<br />\nknowledge -- not campus politics. Consequently, the majority rejected various<br />\nproposals for government by town-meeting<br />\nor representative parliament and adopted<br />\nthe principle of accountable administration,<br />\nas suggested by President Kingman<br />\nBrewster of Yale.<br />\nAccording to Brewster, there are two<br />\nreasons why a parliamentary body is<br />\ninappropriate to university governance.<br />\nFirst, decision-making by Democratic<br />\nrepresentatives of all elements in a<br />\ndiverse university is apt to be too<br />\nslow and ineffective to meet the<br />\ndemands for prompt and flexible<br />\nleadership rising from many quarters.<br />\nSecond, decision-making by a representative parliament would inevitably subordinate learning to campus politics for large<br />\nnumbers -- and, we would add, create in<br />\npractice a new class of transient oligarchs no<br />\nless difficult to control than a few visible<br />\nadministrators. Experiments on other<br />\ncampuses confirm these difficulties. Thus<br />\nwe concluded that what Hopkins needs is<br />\nneither cooption of administrative authority<br />\nby faculty and students nor an unwieldy<br />\nlegislature. What Hopkins needs are<br />\nmechanisms to make administrative<br />\nauthority more responsive, responsible, and<br />\ntherefore supportable.<br />\nHight to Participate<br />\nThough the concept of accountability may<br />\nsound fancy, the idea is simple. If consistently with their educational goals faculty<br /><br />\nand students- cannot directly govern the<br />\nuniversity, they can and should have the<br />\nright to participate in the selection of major<br />\nadministrative officials, the right to be informed and consulted about policies affecting their vital interests, the right to<br />\nexplanation of decisions reached, and the<br />\nright to periodic review of performance in<br />\norder to register or withhold their confidence. Otherwise, responsible administrators cannot reasonably expect their<br />\ncooperation and sustained support.<br />\nOur proposals seek to implement the<br />\nprinciple of accountable administration in<br />\nthree ways:<br />\n(1) creation of more representative advisory bodies, (e.g., the ASRC, the judicial<br />\ninstitutions, etc.);<br />\n(2) clarification and realignment of functions, (e.g., the transfer of all nonacademic<br />\nmatters from the Academic Council to the<br />\nASRC); and<br />\n(3) recognition of administrative and<br />\ndepartmental guidelines as customary<br />\nstandards of participation and conduct to<br />\ninsure more effective communication,<br />\nconsultation, and cooperation. It should be<br />\nstressed that these guidelines, which range<br />\nfrom fixed terms of service to guaranteed<br />\nfiscal information to advisory bodies, are<br />\nintegral to the proposed design. Different<br />\nstructures might well have been recommended without them. Particular proposals<br />\nregarding structure and functions should<br />\ntherefore be read with the guidelines in<br />\nmind.<br />\nWeighted Interests<br />\nAnother principle underlying the report is<br />\norganization according to weighted interests. Each major element of the Division - faculty, students, professional research<br />\nstaff, etc. -- is recognized to have areas of<br />\nexclusive jurisdiction, dominant jurisdiction, and overlapping jurisdiction. For<br />\nexample, the faculty have primary<br />\nresponsibility for academic programs, while<br />\nstudents dominate extra-curricular activities. The faculty have exclusive advisory<br />\nauthority over faculty personnel matters,<br />\n(continued on page 8)<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nThe Disfranchised<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIf we are going to have<br />\nanother referendum on the<br />\nsubject of military recruiting<br />\non campus, how about letting<br />\nthe research assistants,<br />\nresearch associates, and<br />\npostdoctoral students vote<br />\nthis time?

Mayer<br />\nProfessor of Microbiology<br />\nSchool of Medicine<br />\nMann's Ethics<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAssistant Professor Mann,<br />\nin the News-Letter of October<br />\n9, has demonstrated once<br />\nagain that critical thinking<br />\nand careful analysis are in<br />\nthe decline in American<br />\nuniversities, though not<br />\nnecessarily because of<br />\nDepartment of Defense<br />\nfunding. Several examples,<br />\nthough surely not all that may<br />\nbe gleaned from Mann's article, illustrate my point:<br />\nIn dealing with -ethical\"<br />\nquestions, Professor Mann<br />\nimplies that the role played<br /><br />\nby the Department of Defense<br />\nin Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,<br />\nThailand, Guatemala, Chile,<br />\nBrazil, Greece, Spain and<br />\nelsewhere precludes the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University'<br />\nfrom entertaining militarY<br />\nrecruiters.<br />\nI remind Professor Mann<br />\nthat the role of the Dept.

The ASRC will<br />\nbe the central advisory organ<br />\nin all nonacademic affairs of<br />\ncampus-wide concern; it has<br />\npower to constitute committees according to the<br />\nsame weighting principle; it<br />\nwill play a key role in the<br />\namending process; it has<br />\nimportant responsibilities in<br />\ndeveloping codes of conduct<br />\nand<br />\nfair<br />\ndisciplinary<br />\nprocedures.<br />\nThe most difficult problems<br />\nin applying the weighting<br />\nprinciple were academic<br />\nprograms and discipline.<br />\nResolutions of the General<br />\nAssembly and the Academic<br />\nCouncil made plain that the<br />\nfaculty regarded academic<br />\nprograms as their responsibility. Polls taken last<br />\nspring revealed that students<br />\nalso wished to influence,<br />\nthough not necessarily<br />\ncontrol, those decisions. After<br />\ngrappling with this conflict,<br />\nwe finally settled on a<br />\ncompromise containing these<br />\nelements:<br />\nRight to Consult<br /><br />\n(1) faculty are recognized<br />\nto have final advisory<br /><br />\nauthority over academic<br />\nprograms; students are<br />\nrecognized to have the rights<br />\nto propose, to be informed<br />\nand consulted, and to receive<br />\nconcerning<br />\nexplanations<br />\ncurriculum at both ASRC and<br />\ndepartmental levels;<br />\n(2) at central levels,<br />\nstudents are also guaranteed<br />\non<br />\nthe<br />\nrepresentation<br />\nworking committees of the<br />\nAcademic Council -- i.e., the<br />\nCommittee on Unjergraduate<br />\nStudies, the Graduate Board,<br />\nand the interlocking Committee on Instruction, which<br />\nwas designed to meet broader<br />\nproblems of planning a<br />\ncoordination; and<br />\n(3) departmental<br />\nguidelines<br />\nguarantee<br />\nstudents a mechanism to<br />\nrepresent their views to<br />\ndepartments, where most<br />\ncurriculum matters are<br />\ngenerated and resolved. The<br />\nguidelines also guarantee<br />\njunior faculty, for the first<br />\ntime, full participation in<br />\ndepartmental policy-making<br />\nexcept for the determination<br />\nof individual salaries and<br />\npromotions to rank higher<br />\nthan one's own.<br />\nThe question of discipline is<br />\nso complex that comment<br />\nmust be restricted to a few<br />\nsalient points. The committee<br />\nwould have gladly ducked the<br />\nissue but for the feeling that it<br />\nwas too critical for postponement. Constraints of<br />\ntime limited our proposals to<br />\ninstitutions. Codes of conduct<br />\nand fair procedure were left<br />\nto the ASRC representatives<br />\nand in the interim to the dean<br />\nalone. The recommended<br />\nguarantee<br />\ninstitutions<br />\nstudents the option between<br />\ntwo methods of adjudication - administrative or peer<br />\ngroup -- with rights of review<br /><br />\nttagoug!<br />\nprepared for every course<br /><br />\nand petition<br />\nauthority.<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\nhigher<br /><br />\nPower of the Dean<br /><br />\nBy explicitly recognizing<br />\nthe obverse power of the dean<br />\nto overrule decisions of these<br />\njudicial boards -- a power the<br />\ntrustees would have anyway - we may have excited undue<br />\nalarm. Frankly, we find it<br />\nhard to imagine that a dean<br />\nwould be so impolitic as to<br />\noverrule consistently the<br />\nresponsible judgments of<br />\nhearing and appeals boards<br />\ncomposed as recommended.<br />\nAnswer to Critics<br />\nThis issue relates to two<br />\ncriticisms of the majority<br />\nreport we would like to answer in closing. The most<br />\ncommonly heard student<br />\ncriticism is that the proposed<br />\nmechanism is merely advisory and thus offers<br />\nstudents no \"real\" power.<br />\nThis criticism, in our view,<br />\nstems from an overly formalistic view of power.<br />\nTechnically, all power on this<br />\nthe<br />\ncampus<br />\nexcept<br />\nPresident's is advisory and<br />\nthe \u2022President, for that<br />\nmatter, serves at the<br />\npleasure of the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nTerm Explained<br />\nIt is in this technical sense<br /><br />\nthat the committee has used<br />\nthe term \"advisory-\" To<br />\nadvise, as we viewed it, is not<br />\nto proffer statements to a<br />\nfaculty<br />\ncondescending<br />\nmember, dean , or other<br />\nadministrator who may or<br />\nmay not listen according to<br />\npersonal whim. To advise is<br />\nnot just to inform, though it is<br /><br />\ncertainly that in part. To<br />\nadvise, in its full sense, is to<br />\nconvey pressure for timely<br />\nand responsible action,<br />\npressure which really can<br />\ncome from the resolupions<br />\nand recommendations of<br />\nrepresentative organizations<br />\nacting in good faith and with<br />\ndue deliberation.<br />\nDe Facto Influence<br />\nOver the years several<br />\nadvisory bodies -- the<br />\nAcademic Council, the Honor<br />\nCommission, the Committee<br />\non Academic Standing -- have<br />\ndeveloped such de facto influence to the point that their<br />\ndecisions are seldom if ever<br />\noverruled. We see no reason<br />\nwhy a similar relationship<br />\ncannot develop for the ASRC,<br />\nespecially since its advice<br />\nwill be jointly rendered and<br />\nrepresentative.<br />\nWhom do you Trust?<br /><br />\nStudents also respond that<br />\nthe administration and<br />\nfaculty cannot be trusted to<br />\npermit de facto influence to<br />\ndevelop. The short answer is<br />\na question: whom do you<br />\ntrust? No government can<br />\nwait for perfect trust.<br />\nResponsible governments are<br />\ncontrolled by some system of<br /><br />\naccountability. We have<br />\npopular<br />\nthe<br />\nrejected<br />\nassembly method of accountability because we think<br />\nthe vast majority of students<br />\nand faculty feel they have<br />\nbetter things to do than<br />\nbecome \"campus polls.\"<br />\nMore Responsive<br />\nWe have proposed a difof acferent system<br />\ncountability which relies on<br />\nimproved advisory bodies<br />\nplus guidelines. No one will be<br />\ntotally satisfied with every<br />\nelement of the proposals.<br />\nCertainly none of us who<br />\nsigned the majority report<br />\nare.

Comissiona is<br />\ncertainly one of the most<br />\nexciting conductors on the<br />\npodium today, and his<br />\nopening performance again<br />\nreaffirmed the fact that<br />\nBaltimore is indeed lucky to<br />\npossess his talents.<br />\nVirtuosity<br />\nThe remainder of the<br />\nprogram included one of<br />\nAaron Copland's few 12-tone<br />\npieces, \"Inscape\", and the<br />\ngay \"Roman Festivals\" by<br />\nMr.<br />\nAgain,<br />\nRespighi.<br />\nComissiona demonstrated his<br />\nvirtuosity by conducting a<br />\nthoughtful piece of serialistic<br />\nmusic and then switching to a<br />\ntrilogy of tone poems that<br />\nrequired a definite mastery of<br />\norchestral color.<br />\nConsider the Heat<br />\nThe Baltimore Symphony<br />\nalso performed admirably<br />\nconsidering the heat, which<br />\nmust have been unbearable<br />\non stage. It seemed to<br />\nrespond extremely well to<br />\nMr. Comissiona and the orchestra definitely plays with<br />\nmore assurance this year<br />\nthan in the past. There is no<br />\ndoubt that the Lyric theater<br />\nwill present some outstanding<br />\nconcerts this season.<br />\nTwo weeks later, the<br />\nPhiladelphia Orchestra came<br />\nto town with its ailing Music<br /><br />\nDirector, Eugene Ormandy,<br />\nat the helm. The program<br />\nthat night consisted of: \"Two<br />\nPortraits\", Op. 5 by Bela<br />\nBartok; \"Symphony No. 7 in<br />\nA Major, Op. 92,\" by<br />\nBeethoven; and \"Symphony<br />\nNo. 5 in B Flat Major, Op.<br />\n100\"by Prokofieff.<br />\nTwo Portraits\"<br />\nMaestro Ormandy is still<br />\nrecovering from hip surgery<br />\nhe underwent early last<br />\nsummer which makes his<br />\nentrances and exits painfully<br />\nslow. Yet when he is on the<br />\npodium, there is little doubt in<br />\nanyone's mind of Ormandy's<br />\ngreatness. He conducts with a<br />\nmeasured simplicity that<br />\nmade<br />\nlast<br />\nTuesday's<br />\nprogram inspiring.<br />\nThe opening piece was<br />\nBartok's \"Two Portraits\",<br />\nthe first of which was<br />\noriginally written as a violin<br />\nconcerto. The piece begins<br />\nand ends with the solo first<br />\nviolin, and Concertmaster<br />\nNorman Carol literally sang<br />\nBartok's lyrical motif. Ormandy enhanced the performance with a directness of<br />\ntempo and a deep understanding of this early<br />\nBartok work which was first<br />\nperformed in the U. S. by<br />\nOrmandy in 1959.<br /><br />\nBut it was the Beethoven<br />\nSymphony No. 7 that really<br />\nshowed<br />\nwhat<br />\nthe<br />\nPhiladelphians and Ormandy<br />\ncan do. It was tautly controlled and Ormandy wasted<br />\nlittle effort keeping strict<br />\ntempos throughout. All<br />\ntogether, it was a simple and<br />\nforthright interpretation of a<br />\ntreacherous<br />\npiece<br />\nof<br />\nBeethoven.<br />\nDance Quality<br />\nOrmandy kept the orbalanced<br />\nchestra<br />\nwell<br />\nthrough the first three<br />\nmovements, although the<br />\nAllegro was slightly tilted<br />\ntoward the violins at the<br />\nexpense of the cellos and<br />\nbasses. Yet the dramatic<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nquality<br />\ndance<br />\nmovement was never lost.<br />\nIn the final program<br />\nnumber, the Philadelphia<br />\nOrchestra showed its musical<br /><br />\nmuscles<br />\nand<br />\nplayed<br />\nProkofieff's Fifth Symphony<br />\nin a rather straight forward<br />\nfashion. The orchestra was<br />\nsuccessfully guided through<br />\nProkofieff's<br />\nexcess<br />\nof<br />\nmusical verbiage by Mr.<br />\nOrmandy and the tumultuous<br />\naudience response at the<br />\nconclusion was well deserved.<br />\nThe next Philadelphia<br />\nOrchestra program is on Nov.<br />\n24.<br /><br />\njEEp<br />\nGo where you've<br />\nnever gone before<br /><br />\nHERRING JEEP<br />\n310W. 27th St. 889-1719<br /><br />\nHopkins students, new and old<br />\neat at:<br /><br />\nPecora's<br />\nRestaurant<br />\nfor the Finest Italian Food in town<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br /><br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br /><br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br /><br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE.<br />\nCALL 889-3831<br /><br />\nOct. 13, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 10<br /><br />\nBlue Jays Lick Bears In Second Big Win<br />\nBy MIKE ANGEL<br />\nIn a hard fought struggle,<br />\nthe Jays emerged victorious,<br />\nbeating the Ursinus Bears 3428 for their second big win.<br />\nHopkins was first to score<br />\nin the game after Jim Mcmenamin had recovered a<br />\nfumble on the Bear's 37 yard<br />\nline, Bob Pfeifer went on to<br />\nhit Bill Donovan with a 23yard touchdown toss. The try<br />\nfor a 2 point conversion<br />\nfailed, giving Hopkins a 6-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nEarly in the second quarter<br />\nthe Jays made it 14-0 by<br />\nvirtue of a 59 yard pass interception by Tim Weglicki<br />\nand a successful two point<br />\nconversion.<br />\nA few minutes later the<br />\nJays began another drive<br />\nwhich was capped by a fiveyard touchdown reception by<br />\nTim Weglicki. The key play<br />\nin this drive was a 37 yard<br />\npass reception by Tim<br />\nWeglicki.<br />\nThe Bears then scored with<br />\n2:02 remaining in the first<br />\nhalf by a 9-yard run by Freshmen Mark Fieger. Fieger<br />\nwas placed into the game<br />\nbecause of the inability of the<br />\nother Bear quarterback to<br />\nrun the team.
