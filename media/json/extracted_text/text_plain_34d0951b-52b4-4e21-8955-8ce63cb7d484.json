Sculley<br />\ngave a cursory, disjointed overview of the current geopolitical<br />\nsituation, accusing the Japanese<br />\nof having a \"homogeneous<br />\nculture, classifying Soviet communism as a \"failed system,\"<br />\nand predicting \"corporate<br />\nrestructuring\" in Europe.<br />\nSculley suggested that America<br />\nshift its reliance from natural<br />\nresources to resources of the<br />\nmind. His leitmotif in an otherwise loosely-connected speech<br />\nwas an analogy in which he compared the American university<br />\nsystem to the Brazilian rain<br />\nforest.<br />\n<br />\n\"In the ecosystem of the world,<br />\nyou (universities( must be a<br />\nresource of ideas,'' he said, just<br />\nas the Brazilian rain forest is the<br />\nresource for twenty percent of the<br />\noxygen of the globe. \"Its loss will<br />\naffect every other nation,\" he<br />\ncontinued, speaking both of the<br />\nrain forest and of America's<br />\nresearch talent.<br />\nSculley called on Hopkins,<br />\nwhich he praised as a leader in<br />\nmedicine and applied physics, to<br />\nbecome a leader in distributedinformation processing, alternative energies, and information<br />\ntechnology. \"It is a marvelous<br />\ntime to be a young person,\" he<br />\nsaid, foreseeing a future of<br />\nwristwatch supercomputers,<br />\nunderground fiber-optic networks, and high-definition<br />\ntelevision.<br />\n<br />\nBecause the technology and<br />\ncommunications revolution alters<br />\nour lives, Sculley, groping for an<br />\napt and succinct phrase, said Apple Computers is not in the computer business but in the<br />\n\"behavior-changing business.<br />\nWe change the way people think,<br />\ncommunicate, work, the way<br />\npeople learn,\" he elaborated. He<br />\npredicted that the need for experts<br />\nin specialized fields will be<br />\neliminated since \"information<br />\ntechnology will allow us to delve<br />\ninto things that strike our fancy<br />\nor interest us.\"<br />\nIn giving the keynote address,<br />\nSculley received the Doctorate of<br />\nHumane Letter, an honorary doctorate.

According to<br />\nRoss Jones, vice president and<br />\nsecretary of the Board of<br />\nTrustees, \"There was a lot of<br />\nwork done by the Trustees in<br />\nreviewing the plan for several<br />\nmonths before the meeting, so<br />\nthat there was a rather good<br />\nunderstanding [of it] before<br />\n[Wednesday's] meeting.\"<br />\nYoung Trustee Stephanie<br />\nWeissman, interviewed after the<br />\nmeeting, said, \"I think people are<br />\nconcerned about the problems<br />\nthat lie behind the plan, but it was<br />\nneeded and we approved it.\"<br />\nAs the trustees met behind closed doors in the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library's Garrett<br />\n<br />\nRoom, undergraduates rallied<br />\noutside in a protest organized by<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nExpressing their concern over<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan, students<br />\ndecried their exclusion from the<br />\nplan's development.

He had given no signals that<br />\nsuch a move was forthcoming. After<br />\neighteen years at Hopkins, it is difficult<br />\nto imagine what the University will be<br />\nwithout him.<br />\nHaving presided over the University<br />\nduring a period of tremendous growth<br />\nand expansion, Muller shaped his position with an unique vision. The past two<br />\ndecades have seen unprecedented acquisitions and development. Among the<br />\nmore notable accomplishments were the<br />\nestablishment of the Bologna and Nanjing Centers, Hopkins' alliance with<br />\nPeabody, and the establishment of the<br />\nHubble Space Telescope. Alongside<br />\nthese accomplishments, Muller has the<br />\ndistinction of having spearheaded the<br />\nmost successful fundraising campaign in<br />\nHopkins history. Muller has also implemented major changes in the administrative and physical structure of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nThe president's position has grown<br />\nand expanded along with the University. Gone are the days when students can<br />\nexpect the president to actually live in<br />\nthe president's house. The role has gone<br />\nfrom one of close contact with students<br />\nand faculty at Homewood to one with<br />\na much broader perspective. Muller,<br />\nwith responsibilities and obligations to<br />\na much larger system, has had neither<br />\nthe time nor, arguably, the inclination<br />\nto attend to Homewood as much as the<br />\ncommunity here would have liked.<br />\nMuller has never made any bones<br />\nabout the fact that Homewood is just one<br />\nof many stars in the \"Hopkins galaxy\".<br />\nHe has even gone so far as to tell<br />\nfreshmen at his traditional Orientation<br />\n<br />\nspeech that they should not expect to see<br />\nhim more than twice in their college<br />\ncareer: when they enter, and when they<br />\nleave.<br />\nWhile this distance is understandable,<br />\nit has been disconcerting as well. Divisions, particularly the undergraduates at<br />\nHomewood, have felt the need for a<br />\nreassuring day-to-day administrative<br />\npresence. To this end, Muller's delegation of these responsibilities to Provost<br />\nJohn Lombardi in November was a step<br />\nin the right direction. Essentially Lombardi, for all intents and purposes, is<br />\nnow Homewood's president.<br />\nMuller's institutionalized distance has<br />\nensured that the transition period will<br />\nnot be especially tumultuous. Because<br />\nthe newly distanced president has, outside of financial or policymaking decisions, little direct effect upon the<br />\nundergraduates at Homewood, Muller's<br />\nresignation means little in operational<br />\nterms.<br />\nThis is not to diminish the role of the<br />\npresidency; the functions it performs,<br />\nespecially in the areas of fundraising,<br />\nimage-projecting, and providing an<br />\noverall cohesion for the University, are<br />\ninvaluable ones. This is only to say that<br />\nfor undergraduates, the more essential<br />\nquestions to be addressed will continue<br />\nto be addressed by the provost rather<br />\nthan by the president. Thus, we will not<br />\nlikely feel the effects of a change of<br />\npresident as much as we probably would<br />\nhave two decades ago.<br />\nAs the quest for Muller's replacement<br />\nbegins, we wish the search committee<br />\nwell and hope that the replacement will<br />\nexhibit at least as much vision and ability as Muller did. In these deficit days,<br />\nthese will be necessary qualities.<br />\n<br />\nProtesting the Plan<br />\nLast Wednesday was an unusually exciting one here at Homewood. The<br />\nlibrary, not surprisingly, served as the<br />\nmajor site of activity. The Garrett Room<br />\nhoused a full meeting of the Board of<br />\nTrustees in which the controversial<br />\nFive- Year financial plan was approved. Down the hall, President Steven<br />\nMuller announced his resignation to a<br />\npacked room of reporters and<br />\ncameramen. And all the while, outside<br />\nin the intermittent drizzle marched<br />\nstudents carrying placards back and<br />\nforth, protesting.<br />\nThe students were expressing concern<br />\nabout the Five-Year Plan and its<br />\nramifications. They were specifically<br />\nreacting against their lack of involvement in the drafting of the plan and<br />\ndemanded that they have some input in<br />\nits implementation.<br />\nDuring a day in which Hopkins's<br />\nname figured prominently in the media,<br />\nthese students managed to secure at least<br />\nas much attention as the other issues.<br />\nThat they attracted the media eye had<br />\nmuch to do with their organization and<br />\ndemands. Their protest came on the<br />\nheels of a rally the night before in which<br />\n<br />\nstudents, faculty, and staff had voiced<br />\nconcerns. Apparently, the audience was<br />\nmotivated enough to circulate petitions<br />\nthat evening and to gather the following morning to bring their concerns<br />\ndirectly to the Trustees.<br />\nCredit must go to Student Council<br />\nPresident Lou Giangiulio and a score of<br />\nothers for staging the event which,<br />\nunlike student debacles of the recent<br />\npast, was conducted in an efficient<br />\nfashion. What is more, from early indications, they seem to have gotten what<br />\nthey wanted.<br />\nProvost John Lombardi has agreed to<br />\nmeet with Council next Wednesday to<br />\ndiscuss in greater detail their demands<br />\nand in addition will hold a series of<br />\n\"town meetings\" on plan implementation.<br />\nWe are heartened by both this responsible display of student activism and by<br />\nthe speedy response of the administration. Certainly, the restrictions the FiveYear Plan are placing upon the community call for cooperation among all<br />\nsectors of society.

Feed<br />\na plant too little, it dies. Feed it<br />\ntoo much, you do.<br />\nUnder the direction of Jill<br />\nEhnenn, Little Shop, which plays<br />\nthrough Sunday, is one of the<br />\nmore memorable works the Barnstormers have produced, not just<br />\nfor its technical complexity but<br />\nfor its consistently strong acting.<br />\nIn resisting the temptation to<br />\nmock the script's outlandishness,<br />\nthe cast gives a sweet, honest portrayal of a botanical nightmare.<br />\nWritten by Howard Ashman<br />\nand Alan Menken, Little Shop<br />\nhad a long Off-Broadway run<br />\nbefore it hit the big screen-. It is<br />\na period piece, taking place \"in<br />\nthe decade not too long before our<br />\nown,\" but most of the jokes are<br />\ntimeless. Though the Barnstormers' production hews closely to the movie's comedic style,<br />\nit retains the original ending,<br />\nwhich will surprise those who<br />\nsaw only the movie.<br />\nThe musical chronicles the rise<br />\nof Seymour Krelborn (Jim<br />\nStofan), a meek Skid Row florist<br />\nclerk who nurses a rare plant to<br />\nboth health and impossible size.<br />\nWhile Seymour gains local and<br />\nnational renown, his love interest<br />\nAudrey (Kathy Kenrw,dy), a coworker, slowly becomes attracted<br />\n<br />\nto him.<br />\nAs the plant grows, Mr.<br />\nMuchnik (Jason Katz), the plant<br />\nshop owner, sees a gold mine in<br />\nthe plant and starts to baby<br />\nSeymour, without whose plant<br />\nthe store cannot survive.<br />\nMuchnik does not understand<br />\nemployee devotion, only the bottom line.<br />\nThe attention, of course, confuses Seymour. Unfamiliar with<br />\nsuccess, Seymour confronts<br />\nfame, respect, and love, not just<br />\nfrom the store's customers and<br />\nSkid Row derelicts, but from the<br />\nmedia. He soon feels as if he has<br />\nlost control of his life, as if his<br />\nsuccess is measured by the<br />\nnotoriety and size of his plant (it<br />\nis).<br />\nAudrey, meanwhile, is directionless. Heavily made-up, wearing dime-store clothing, she dates<br />\nOrin Scrivello, D.D.S. (Jeremy<br />\nGolub), a biker by night and a<br />\nsadistic dentist by day, who inhales laughing gas for pleasure.<br />\nAudrey is no dumb blonde, but<br />\nresists using her intelligence and<br />\nexpressing her inner warmth.<br />\nThen comes the plant. Seymour<br />\nnames it Audrey II, after guess<br />\nwho, when the plant is still a<br />\nbaby. Unlike its namesake,<br />\nAudrey II is ugly, with a mouth<br />\nas fresh as it is big. Audrey H eats<br />\nhuman blood, which Seymour<br />\nprovides until the plant gets too<br />\n<br />\nbig.<br />\nAudrey H goes through four incarnations, from baby at the<br />\nbeginning to slightly-bigger-thanbaby at the finale. Though more<br />\nimposing at the end, Audrey II is<br />\nperhaps most interesting in its second incarnation, when it seems<br />\nto dance by itself in Seymour's<br />\narms.<br />\nPlaying Seymour, Stofan is appropriately meek. Possessing<br />\nthick glasses, a protruding lower<br />\nlip, and hair that can charitably<br />\nbe called a mistake, he certainly<br />\nlooks the part, though the \"real\"<br />\nSeymour lives behind the glasses,<br />\nas Audrey finds out.<br />\nStofan's body language provides an amusing added dimension to the comedy, particularly<br />\nhis limp pose as Audrey sings<br />\n\"Suddenly Seymour.\" In all,<br />\nStofan seems even a little too<br />\nagile for his role\u2014perhaps a few<br />\nmore displays of Seymour's inherent clumsiness might have<br />\nhelped.<br />\nYet the high-pitched, nervous<br />\ntremor in Seymour's voice constantly highlights his growing<br />\nuncertainty over his newfound<br />\nsuccess. Stofan is at his best in his<br />\ninterplay with boss Mushnik in<br />\n\"Mushnik and Son,\" when<br />\nSeymour seems to confuse his<br />\nboss's likes for him and his plant.<br />\nThe role of Mushnik is weaker<br />\nto begin with, alternating between<br />\n<br />\nFrears' Technicolor Tomfoolery<br />\nby David Dudley<br />\n\"Costume Drama\" is a term<br />\noften now consigned to a distant<br />\npast of day-glo Technicolor extravaganzas based on books you<br />\nnever liked in high school.<br />\nEverybody talked like Emily<br />\nBronte and wore fabulously illogical clothing. The men had<br />\npowdered wigs and make-up, the<br />\nwomen were bound in hoopskirts<br />\nand nightmarish trusses and carried small dogs on velvet pillows.<br />\nNo one ever got shot. They were<br />\nunpleasant, turgid affairs, but<br />\nyour parents liked them. Stephen<br />\nFrears's Dangerous Liaisons has<br />\nall of these things, and more. It's<br />\ngot good ol' American actors<br />\ndressed like foppish Frenchpeople, heaving constrained breasts,<br />\nvengeful domineering women,<br />\nthe occasional grimy peasant,<br />\ncunning references to semi-legal<br />\nsex acts, bloodletting, miscarriages, and full-frontal nudity.<br />\nThink of it as the Costume Drama<br />\nfor the Nineties.<br />\nDirector Frears, whose<br />\nprevious credits have been limited<br />\nto the British independent cult hits<br />\nMy Beautiful Laundrette and<br />\nSammy and Rosie Get Laid (films<br />\nyour parents probably didn't<br />\nlike), has found himself helming<br />\na mammoth $14 million AngloAmerican production that boasts<br />\na trio of distinctively American<br />\nstars: Glenn Close, John<br />\nMalkovich, and Michelle<br />\nPfeiffer.<br />\nThe incongruity of these three<br />\ndecked out in magnificently baroque, late 18th-century French<br />\nfinery and acting like preRevolutionary aristocrats was apparently not lost on the director,<br />\n<br />\nand thus he revels in the frills and<br />\nthe foppery. He rubs your face in<br />\nit, makes a performance out of<br />\nthe intricate rituals of fashion and<br />\nmanners and the studied deception of appearance. The<br />\nfascinating opening sequence of<br />\nthe film show Close and<br />\nMalkovich being primped and<br />\npowdered and garroted into their<br />\nelaborate garb by a hushed army<br />\nof servants, like performers<br />\nbefore a show or knights before<br />\ncombat. The costume becomes<br />\ndrama, and the characters are<br />\nboth performers in their own personal operas and combatants vying for control.<br />\nThe drama itself revolves<br />\naround the competitive intrigues<br />\nof Close's Marquise de Merteuil<br />\nand Malkovich's Vicomte de Valmont, two French aristocrats with<br />\na taste for seduction and a lot of<br />\ntime on their hands. Romance is<br />\nan intricate game of manipulation<br />\nand deceit, and they are both experienced players. Valmont's<br />\nquarry is one Madame de Tourval (Michelle Pfeiffer), a pillar of<br />\nChristian virtue and decency with<br />\na distant husband. Valmont sees<br />\nin her the ultimate challenge to<br />\nhis skills and makes a wager on<br />\nhis eventual succcess with<br />\nMerteuil, who is meanwhile raising hell in other quarters of the<br />\ncourt with her own schemes.<br />\nThings get very convoluted, and<br />\neventually everyone dies or goes<br />\ninsane or otherwise pays the<br />\nwages of sin.<br />\nLiaisons is being heaped with<br />\nAcademy Award nominations,<br />\nand it seems to have touched a<br />\nnerve in the fickle American<br />\npublic in much the same way that<br />\nlast year's Fatal Attraction did.<br />\nThe comparison is inevitable and<br />\n<br />\nnot entirely undeserved, given the<br />\npresence of Glenn Close in a<br />\nsuperficially-similar role. \"I was<br />\nborn to dominate your sex and<br />\navenge my own,\" she intones at<br />\none point in the film, calling up<br />\nechoes of Attraction's vengeful<br />\nwoman-as-vindicator persona.<br />\nBut Close's Marquise is a cool<br />\nmanipulator, not a knife-wielding<br />\npsychotic, and though her obsessions prove equally tragic, it is<br />\nsomehow a more restrained, cunning performance. Caked in her<br />\npale death-white makeup and<br />\ntrussed into her hoop-skirt battle<br />\narmor, she is a picture of<br />\nbloodless, relentless cruelty\u2014<br />\nantisexual where Fatal Attraction<br />\nwas violently sexual.<br />\nJohn Malkovich's Vicomte de<br />\nValmont has a certain fascination<br />\nall its own, if only for the often<br />\nclumsy spectacle of hearing the<br />\nconsummate American actor<br />\nwrap his Midwestern drawl<br />\naround David Hampton's precise,<br />\nesoteric dialogue. It takes some<br />\ngetting used to, but his serpentine<br />\ngrace and understated approach<br />\nmake him a commanding and<br />\nbelievable screen figure nevertheless. Michelle Pfeiffer looks<br />\nappropriately pale and winsome<br />\nin the less demanding role of<br />\nMadame de Tourval, but she has<br />\nnone of the depth of the other<br />\ntwo. Her performance is largely<br />\ncold blue eyes and the occasional<br />\nwracked sob and heaving breast.<br />\nThe script, written by Hampton from his own stage play, is<br />\non Les Liaisons<br />\nbased<br />\nDangereuses, a scandalous 18thcentury novel by Choderlos de<br />\nLaclos that was banned after the<br />\nRevolution for its hearty depictions of aristocratic tomfoolery.<br />\nHampton's screenplay is literate<br />\n<br />\nthose of stereotypical Poles,<br />\nJews, and immigrants, all of<br />\nwhom have nothing better to do<br />\nthan scrap for money and, when<br />\nthey fail, blame someone else.<br />\nKatz's portrayal is right on the<br />\nmark, though<br />\nMushnik's<br />\ncharacter is too one-dimensional<br />\nfor Katz to develop it better. His<br />\nbest scenes, too, are with<br />\nSeymour.<br />\nAs Audrey, Kennedy overplays<br />\nher role, but the role deserves to<br />\nbe overplayed. Kennedy's speaking and singing voices are sufficiently wispy, and the seemingly<br />\nuncharacteristic power her voice<br />\ntakes on in \"Suddenly Seymour\"<br />\naccurately reflects Audrey's<br />\ndiscovery of an \"ideal\" in<br />\nSeymour, an ideal Audrey never<br />\nknew.<br />\nKennedy is at her best in the<br />\nsolo \"Somewhere That's<br />\nGreen,\" in which Audrey longs<br />\nto escape Skid Row for the grassy<br />\nelegance of the suburbs. To say<br />\nmore would ruin the funniest line<br />\nin the song.<br />\nGolub plays the sadistic dentist<br />\nnicely. His voice and intonation<br />\nclearly reflect Orin's excesses,<br />\nand his facial expressions<br />\nhighlight the wretched excess the<br />\ndentist preaches and practices.<br />\nLike Mushnik, Orin is a onedimensional character, but Golub<br />\nlargely overcomes this handicap.<br />\nAs the voice of Aldrey II, An-<br />\n<br />\ndy Angelino does a good imitation of the Motown shriek the<br />\nscript demands. The accent is difficult to master, but Angelino<br />\ndoes well except in the higher<br />\nranges.<br />\nSince Little Shop is in part a<br />\nspoof of 1950s culture as well as<br />\nof B-movies and science fiction,<br />\nit has an obligatory female trio of<br />\nsingers, the Plantlettes, who wear<br />\ndated dresses and hairdos.<br />\nThe Plantlettes\u2014Marci Anderson, Mary Kita, and Kara<br />\nStein\u2014have no business in Skid<br />\nRow other than to inject their<br />\nthree-part harmonies into spots<br />\nwhen no one else is speaking, or<br />\nto offer shallow, unwanted advice<br />\nto Seymour. They are just, well,<br />\nalways there.<br />\nThat's a good thing. Anderson,<br />\nKita, and Stein are good singers,<br />\nand funny because they always<br />\nturn up just when other characters<br />\ndon't need them.<br />\nBy and large, the show is a success. It's shortcomings result<br />\nlargely from weaknesses in the<br />\nscript, not in the acting. Yet in a<br />\nshow whose songs are as funny<br />\nas its dialogue, these lapses pale.<br />\nBuy a ticket.

He cited<br />\nstudies of external features showing physical similarities between<br />\napes and man. However, Darwin<br />\nwas unable to deduce the order of<br />\nevolution of most other species;<br />\nwhether birds came from reptiles<br />\nor vice versa. Since then, the<br />\nevolutionary order has been<br />\nestablished to the level of species,<br />\nfrom fossil records, comparative<br />\nstudies of internal and external<br />\nstructures and, more recently, by<br />\nthe molecular biology of proteins.<br />\nHemoglobin is an oxygencarrying protein found in red<br />\nblood cells and free in blood.<br />\nStructurally, it is made up of four<br />\ndistinct protein chains, two alpha<br />\nchains and two beta chains, which<br />\nare made of amino acids linked<br />\nlinearly. All alpha chains have<br />\nsome common amino acid sequences, but may differ in others.<br />\nEach chain also contains, at its<br />\ncore, an iron atom that binds oxygen at the oxygen-rich lungs,<br />\nand releases it at oxygen-deficient<br />\ntissues.<br />\nIn 1959, Max Perutz at Cambridge saw that alpha and beta<br />\nchains from horses and those<br />\nfrom sperm whales had the same<br />\namino acid sequence. Perutz<br />\ntheorized that hemoglobin from<br />\nhorses and those from sperm<br />\nwhales developed from a com-<br />\n<br />\nmon genetic precursor. Perutz's<br />\nteam and others analyzed<br />\nhemoglobin from more animals<br />\nand found common amino acid<br />\nsequences. For example, in all<br />\nanimals, every hemoglobin chain<br />\nhas a histidine amino acid at the<br />\neighty-seventh position.<br />\nAll alpha chains have identical<br />\namino acids at 23 of their 141<br />\npositions, while beta chains have<br />\nthe same amino acids in 20 out of<br />\n146 positions. If only mammalian<br />\nsequences are analyzed, then<br />\nidentical amino acids can be<br />\nfound at 50 out of 141 positions<br />\nin alpha chains, and Si out of 146<br />\npositions in beta chains. Alpha<br />\nchains of man and rhesus<br />\nmonkeys differ by only 4 positions out of 141, cows and man<br />\ndiffer by 17, while sharks and<br />\nman differ by 99 amino acids.<br />\nSimilar data supports Perutz's<br />\ngeneral principle of evolution,<br />\nwhich states that the more closely related two species are, the<br />\nmore similar the amino acid sequences of their proteins will be.<br />\nIn all animals, hemoglobin performs the same function: it acts<br />\nas an oxygen carrier. Certain<br />\namino acids are 'conserved' during evolution, because they are<br />\nnecessary for the function and<br />\nstructure of hemoglobin. These<br />\namino acids cannot be replaced<br />\nby other amino acids, because<br />\nany change will impair the<br />\nhemoglobin's function. Individuals missing these amino<br />\nacids because of mutation will die<br />\n<br />\nbefore they reproduce. For example, the iron atom, vital for oxygen transport, is held in place by<br />\nbinding to the histidine at the<br />\neighty-seventh position of both<br />\nalpha and beta chains. If histidine<br />\nwere to be replaced by any other<br />\namino acid, the iron atom would<br />\nnot be held firmly in place. Any<br />\nchange in the iron's position<br />\nmakes oxygen less accessible.<br />\nScientists use Perutz's general<br />\nprinciple of evolution to analyze<br />\nthe number of differences between hemoglobin chains from<br />\ndifferent species. Researchers<br />\nnow believe that birds evolved<br />\nfrom primitive reptiles, that<br />\nwhales are more evolved<br />\ncreatures than platypuses, that<br />\ncarp are closer in the evolutionary<br />\ntree to man than sharks, and so<br />\non. Some plants, like soybeans,<br />\nhave hemoglobin; their alpha<br />\nchains differ from that of humans<br />\nby 113 out of 141 amino acids.<br />\nHence, from comparative<br />\nhemoglobin studies, we know that<br />\nplants and humans, though<br />\nseparated from each other on the<br />\nevolutionary tree, have a common ancestor.<br />\nScientists are attempting to take<br />\nthis order a step further by looking at the source of the amino<br />\nacids. Amino acids are encoded<br />\nby specific genes that are passed<br />\nfrom parent to offspring.<br />\nGeneticists study the genes that<br />\nencode for the alpha and beta<br />\nchains. Studies have shown many<br />\nsimilarities in these genes,<br />\n<br />\nespecially those that encode for<br />\nvital amino acids. Many highly<br />\nconserved sequences are present<br />\nalong with a number of moderately conserved sequences. Gene<br />\nstudies are useful because scientists can find varying degrees of<br />\nconservation of genes and from<br />\nthis draw more accurate conclusions about evolution of subspecies and other lower orders.<br />\nFrom gene studies, scientists<br />\ncan also establish a time scale for<br />\nthe evolutionary tree because<br />\nchanges that lead to evolution occur at the level of the gene. Mutations change genes and are<br />\nresponsible for the variation<br />\namong species. Scientists make a<br />\ntime frame for each mutation by<br />\ncomparing hemoglobin chains of<br />\nclosely related species. If two<br />\nclosely related species differ by<br />\n10 mutations, and if fossil records<br />\nshow that the two species are ten<br />\nmillion years apart, then each<br />\nmutation must take on the average<br />\na million years.<br />\nBy making a time frame for<br />\neach mutation, scientists have<br />\ncome up with a biological clock<br />\nto accompany the evolutionary<br />\ntree. The unique feature of the<br />\nclock is its varying speed;<br />\nsometimes, the rate of mutation<br />\nis high, but at other times, it is<br />\nalmost negligible. The clock<br />\nallows for natural selection. For<br />\nexample, if a mutation in one<br />\ngene is selected for by nature,<br />\nthen it may trigger mutations in<br />\nother genes, thus speeding up the<br />\n<br />\nclock. Similarly, if a mutation is<br />\nrejected by nature, then other<br />\nmutations may also be blocked,<br />\nslowing down the clock.<br />\nGeneticists using the biological<br />\nclock estimate that plants and<br />\nanimals separated 500 million<br />\nyears ago, that reptiles evolved<br />\n300 million years ago, that<br />\nprimitive mammals evolved 100<br />\nmillion years ago, that monkeys<br />\nevolved less than 30 million years<br />\nago, and that man evolved from<br />\nmonkeys less than 15 million<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nHowever, the evolutionary tree<br />\nis still incomplete and the order<br />\nof evolution of some species is<br />\nunclear. Federal funding for mapping hemoglobin genes is<br />\nseventy-five million dollars for<br />\n1989. By studying the past patterns of evolution, scientists hope<br />\nto predict the future.<br />\n<br />\nSir James W.

Lacrosse '88 was such<br />\na resounding success that the News-Letter has<br />\ndecided to make it an annual tradition.<br />\nTherefore, we give you Lacrosse '89, a look<br />\nat the Division I contenders with emphasis<br />\non tomorrow's matchup between the Johns<br />\nHopkins Blue Jays and the Syracuse<br />\nOrangemen.<br />\nAs with any project of this magnitude,<br />\nthere are many people who should be thanked for their contributions. First of all, we<br />\nwould like to thank Coaches Don Zimmerman and Roy Simmons, Jr. (of Syracuse),<br />\nas well as the Sports Information Departments of both Hopkins and Syracuse, for<br />\ntheir help in providing much of the information contained in this issue.<br />\nWe would also like to thank the reporters<br />\nwho contributed to Lacrosse '89, especially Mike Farbowitz, who gave much time and<br />\neffort to this production.<br />\nSpecial thanks go to Photo Editors Ely<br />\nBrown and John Misa, as well as<br />\nphotographer Bob Nelson, for all of their<br />\ncamera work. Jeff Blitz, Don Holloway,<br />\nKevin McCrea, and Mark Rodeffer gave<br />\nplenty of help whenever called upon.<br />\nWe are very grateful to Business Managers<br />\nJonathan Engler and Julie Levine for handling the advertising and helping out in many<br />\nother ways. Copy Editor T.H.

In five years as head coach, Zimmerman has<br />\nguided the Blue Jays to three titles.<br />\nThree returning All-Americans, including the nation's top defenseman and top goalkeeper, lead a very<br />\ntalented Hopkins team on the drive to the National<br />\nChampionship. The road will be filled with obstacles,<br />\nmost notably tomorrow's opponent, top-ranked and<br />\ndefending champion Syracuse University. Although<br />\nthe Orangemen are the favorites to defeat Hopkins,<br />\nand ultimately to repeat as champs, Coach Zimmerman is confident of his team's ability.<br />\nATTACK<br />\n\"We have a more powerful offense this year,\"<br />\nsays Coach Zimmerman.<br />\nSophomore Mike Panetta (in 1988, 10 goals, 4<br />\nassists) heads an attack which must compensate for<br />\nthe loss to graduation of first-team All-America Mike<br />\nMorrill. Scoring a team-high 26 goals last season,<br />\nMorrill accounted for almost 25% of the Jays'<br />\noffense.<br />\nPanetta has the ability to be one of the top attackmen<br />\nin the country. He forces the action the most of<br />\nanyone we've had since [Craig] Bubier, maybe<br />\nmore,\" says Zimmerman.<br />\nSenior Jeff Ihm (12 goals, 5 assists) and either<br />\njunior Jay Clarke or senior John Ciccarone will join<br />\nPanetta on the starting attack unit. Junior Scott Marr<br />\nand sophomre Mike Morrissey are experienced<br />\nplayers who should see considerable playing time.<br />\nMarr is the Jays' leading returning scorer with 28<br />\npoints last season (12 goals, 16 assists.) Freshman<br />\nJeff Wills (Linthicum, MD), a member of the extraman offensive unit, is one of four newcomers who<br />\nCoach Zimmerman expects to contribute immediately. Freshman Drew Burns (Severna Park, MD)<br />\nrounds out the attack.<br />\n<br />\ntion. Only Jack Crawford, who graduated, is lost<br />\nfrom last year's team.<br />\nCaptain and senior Brenden Kelly (second-team<br />\nAll-America), senior John Wilkens, and freshman<br />\nBrian Lucacz (Acton, MA)form the starting middie unit. The two seniors each netted 11 goals in<br />\n1988; Kelly earned 8 assists, Wilkens 2. Lucacz is<br />\nthe Jays' most-highly touted freshman.<br />\nSenior Joe Rzempoluch, junior Greg Kelly, and<br />\nfreshman Adam Wright(Commack, NY)comprise<br />\nthe second midfield. \"Rezy\" and Greg Kelly are also<br />\nthe team's top face-off men. Senior Pat Russell will<br />\nplay on the defensive midfield (or \"rope\") unit.<br />\nSenior John Dressel and sophomores Mark<br />\nDressel, Jim Harkin, John Sheehan, Seth Tierney,<br />\nand Jay Wright will all compete for playing time.<br />\nSheehan is suffering from an aggravated knee, and<br />\nmay be unavailable for the Syracuse game.<br />\nFreshman Robbi Robertson (Pepper Pike, OH)will<br />\nin extra-man situations. Freshmen Doug Eddy<br />\nplay<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\n, MD)and Keith Gertsen (Glen Arm, MD)<br />\n(Frederick<br />\nBlue<br />\nthe<br />\nOutstanding is the best way to describe<br />\nJays' depth at midfield. A capable group of complete the midfield corps.<br />\nnewcomers join nine returning lettermen at the posi:)EFENSE<br />\n\"We're thin on defense,\" explains Coach Zimmerman. Zimmerman hopes that experience and<br />\nability at the position will make up for the lack of<br />\ndepth. Due to knee injuries, the Jays are without<br />\nthird-team All-America senior James DeTommaso<br />\nand junior Dave Howland for the season. Both will<br />\nreturn for the 1990 campaign.<br />\nSenior Dave Pietramala, first-team All-America<br />\nand winner of the Schmeisser Award as the top<br />\ndefenseman in the country, directs the defense.<br />\nSeniors Steve Ciccarone and Greg Lilly team with<br />\nPietramala on the starting defense.<br />\nSophomores Billy Dwan and Brian Voelker join<br />\nmidfielder Pat Russel on the rope unit. Senior Chip<br />\nDates and sophomores Jamie McNealey could both<br />\nsee extensive playing time. Nick Shevillo (Bloomfield Hills, MI) is the lone freshman defenseman.<br />\n<br />\nGOAL<br />\nQuint Kessenich is the premier goalkeeper in college lacrosse. Last year, as a sophomore, Kessenich<br />\nwon first-team All-American honors and the C.<br />\nMarkland Kelly Award as the nation's outstanding<br />\ngoalkeeper in Division I lacrosse. Over the past two<br />\nyears, the Jays have won 16 of the 18 games that<br />\nKessenich has started.<br />\n\"Quint looks as good now as he ever has. He has<br />\ndone a tremendous job of preparing physically and<br />\nmentally for the Syracuse game and for the season,\"<br />\nsays Zimmerman.<br />\nScott Giardina (Farmingdale, NY)and Ian Hobbs<br />\n(New Canaan, CT)are promising freshmen who will<br />\nback up Kessenich.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Don Zimmerman is exicted about the 1989<br />\nseason.<br />\n\"This year we have more depth on the squad,\"<br />\nsaid Zimmerman. \"We're going at a good pace. We<br />\nwill be ready for Syracuse, March 4th.\"<br />\nTomorrow, Zimmerman and the Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nteam face an unenviable task. The Jays open the 1989<br />\nseason by playing a Syracuse team that appears even<br />\nbetter than the 1988 Orangemen.<br />\nLast year, in the season opener for both teams,<br />\nSyracuse trounced the Blue Jays at Homewood, 19-7.<br />\nThe loss was the most one-sided in Zimmerman's<br />\nfive years as head coach. The Orangemen then sailed on to a perfect 15-0 record and the National<br />\nChampionship.<br />\nSyracuse's greatest weapon is the Gait twins. The<br />\njunior midfielders were both named first-team AllAmerica last season. Gary, consensus Player of the<br />\nYear, scored a record-breaking 70 goals; Paul netted 47.<br />\n\"The impact they made last year on lacrosse was<br />\nas significant as any since Jim Brown,\" said Coach<br />\nZimmerman. Syracuse alumnus Jim Brown, more<br />\nfamous for his achievements on the football field,<br />\nis widely considered the greatest lacrosse player ever.<br />\n\"The Gaits are excellent players, they're dominant. They have to be held in check,\" said Zimmerman. \"It'll be tough for them to put together backto-back seasons like that.\"<br />\nWith the Gaits, Attackman of the Year John<br />\nZulberti, goalie Matt Palumb (the most valuable<br />\nplayer of the 1988 championship game), and four<br />\nother returning starters, the Orangemen are not only predicted to repeat as champions, they are expected<br />\nto. The team is generally considered unbeatable. But<br />\nZimmerman believes there is a team that can defeat<br />\nSyracuse.<br />\n\"We are aiming to win, and we can win.\" said<br />\nZimmerman. He explained that Hopkins must control the tempo, not allowing the Orangemen to play<br />\ntheir fast-paced, running game, and must also hustle for groundballs.<br />\nIn regard to last season's game, Zimmerman issued<br />\nthe following statement: \"Losing to Syracuse was<br />\nembarrassing enough, having people throw oranges<br />\nwas humiliating.

For<br />\nthose of you who are regular readers of the NewsLetter, the following article is the lacrosse version<br />\nof Pat's Picks. Here is how I see the season shaping up for the Jays.<br />\n<br />\nSYRACUSE<br />\nSaturday, March 4<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 10-5<br />\nThis seems like a fairly easy pick. After all,this<br />\nis pretty much the same Syracuse that came to into<br />\nHomewood last year and rocked the Jays 19-7 en<br />\nroute to an undefeated national championship. The<br />\nOrangemen are loaded, to say the least. The midfield is paced by the most prolific tandem to hit<br />\nlacrosse in quite some time, the Gait brothers. The<br />\nattack unit from last year returns intact, led by first<br />\nteam All-American John Zulberti (22 goals, 47<br />\nassists) and honorable mention All-American Greg<br />\nBurns. A defensive unit which failed to relinquish<br />\nmore than ten goals in any game last season also<br />\nreturns all of its starters, including goalie Matt<br />\nPalumb (17-1 as a starter). With a lineup like this,<br />\nhow can the Orangemen fail to defeat Hopkins for<br />\nthe fourth straight time?<br />\nYet I think that the Jays can pull off the upset. First<br />\nof all, Syracuse can't be happy with being booted<br />\nfrom the Carrier Dome for the sake of a nationally<br />\ntelevised basketball game. Secondly, the Orange have<br />\nnever faced Quint Kessenich, and he just might make<br />\nthe difference in this year's game. Thirdly, Hopkins<br />\nhas revenge on their minds, and I don't believe they<br />\nwill be embarrassed at home for two consecutive<br />\nyears.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 12, Syracuse 11<br />\n<br />\nWASHINGTON COLLEGE<br />\nSaturday, March 11<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 28-1<br />\nThe Division III Shoremen gave Hopkins all they<br />\ncould handle last year in Chestertown, losing only<br />\n12-8. They finished the regular season with a sevengame winning streak before losing in the Division<br />\nIII quarterfinals to wind up 12-5. Three of their five<br />\nlosses came at the hands of nationally-ranked Division I foes.<br />\nThe Shoremen return eleven seniors and five Division III All-Americas from last year's team. They<br />\nare led on offense by attackman Tim Hormes, who<br />\nscored 49 goals and had 20 assists last season. Defensively, Division III Defenseman of the Year Matt<br />\nWilson is back, but he is hardly enough to stop the<br />\nHopkins attack.<br />\nThe Shoremen may be one of Division III's better teams, but they are no match for the Jays,<br />\nespecially here at HomeNk ood.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 17, Washington College 7<br />\n<br />\nRUTGERS<br />\nSaturday, March 18<br />\nPiscataway, NJ<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 22-3<br />\nThis may be a big year for the Scarlet Knights,<br />\nas they return 37 players from their 1988 squad which<br />\nwent 8-5 and finished the season ranked fifteenth na-<br />\n<br />\ntionally. They've played tough against Hopkins in<br />\nthe last two years, losing 12-9 here at Homewood<br />\nlast season and 10-7 in New Jersey in 1987.<br />\nRutgers is stacked on offense, paced by attackman<br />\nAndy DeCicco (21 goals) and midfielder Greg<br />\nRinaldi, who earned third team All-America honors<br />\nlast year by scoring 30 goals. Rinaldi is joined by<br />\nsixteen other returning lettermen at midfield.<br />\nBut the Scarlet Knights will be weak on defense,<br />\nand they lost their goalie, Jim Gilman, to graduation. They may stay with Hopkins for a few periods,<br />\nbut defense will be the key to this one.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 13, Rutgers 7<br />\n<br />\nNORTH CAROLINA<br />\nSaturday, April 8<br />\nChapel Hill, NC<br />\n3:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 8-6<br />\n<br />\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and predict a<br />\none-goal game. Actually, it's fairly easy to predict<br />\nthat this game will be decided in the final seconds<br />\nor even in overtime, because seven of the last eight<br />\nmeetings between these two rivals have been decided by one goal. Last year, goalies Barney Aburn and<br />\nQuint Kessenich squared off in a defensive battle here<br />\nat Homewood as Hopkins edged the Tar Heels 6-5.<br />\nBut Carolina was hurt badly by graduation, losSaturday, March 25<br />\ning Aburn, who led the nation with a .709 save<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\npercentage last year, and four other All-Americas.<br />\nGone are first-team defenseman Boyd Harden, sec2:00 p.m.<br />\nond-team midfielder Tim Welsh, third-team midHopkins leads the series 43-12 fielder Kevin Haus, and honorable mention midfielder Ted Brown.<br />\nThe Tigers, under former Hopkins assistant Bill<br />\nBut despite all of these losses, the Tar Heels will<br />\nTierney, are trying to build a program capable of be strong once again, and having the game in Chapel<br />\ncompeting in the Ivy League.

The victory was the Cavaliers' second<br />\nstraight at Homewood, as they also upset the Jays<br />\n9-7 in '87.<br />\nHowever, goalie Peter Sheehan, who was simply<br />\namazing in last year's quarterfinal matchup, will not<br />\nbe back to torment the Jays, as he has been lost to<br />\ngraduation. Although the Wahoos are a very talented<br />\nteam capable of making their second straight trip to<br />\nthe Final Four, I don't think they will beat Hopkins<br />\nwithout Sheehan.<br />\nFirst team All-America midfielder Andy Kraus will<br />\nkeep this one close, but look for the Jays to prevail<br />\nin the end.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 9, Virginia 8<br />\n<br />\nSaturday, April 15<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 44-13<br />\nArmy was also hurt by graduation, losing their<br />\nleading scorer Bob Betchley (second team AllAmerica)and goalie Joe Portuese. The Cadets usually<br />\nplay a very physical, low-scoring game against<br />\nHopkins, and this year will be no different. But<br />\nwithout Betchley, Army won't stay as close as they<br />\nhave in the last two years, and the Jays will be hungry<br />\nafter the loss at Carolina.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 11, Army 6<br />\nSee SCHEDULE, 7<br />\n<br />\nGood luck,<br />\nJays!<br />\n<br />\n\fLACROSSE '89/7<br />\n<br />\nSyracuse tomorrow in battle for number one<br />\nSCHEDULE, from 6<br />\n<br />\nMARYLAND<br />\nSaturday, April 22<br />\nCollege Park, MD<br />\n1:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 46-30-1<br />\n<br />\nfalling to Syracuse in the NCAA quarterfinals.

Brenner and Gopal Kowdley<br />\nWith Eddie Murray transplanted to La-La Land,<br />\nand the remaining Orioles resembling a club from the<br />\nInternational League, Baltimore's top spring sports<br />\ndraw remains the Blue Jays of Johns Hopkins University. Although last year ended in disappointing<br />\nfashion at the hands of Peter Sheehan and the Wahoos<br />\nof Virginia, the Blue Jays still managed to win nine<br />\nconsecutive games against many of the best collegiate<br />\nlacrosse teams in the nation.<br />\nBy now,even the freshmen realize that for the 1989<br />\nJays to be victorious on Memorial Day in College<br />\nPark, they must fare better against the Syracuse<br />\nOrangemen, who last year invaded Homewood and<br />\ntrounced Hopkins 19-7. The Orange steamrolled<br />\nthrough their remaining regular season encounters,<br />\nas well as the NCAA tournament, en route to the<br />\nNational Championshop. However, as any Orioles<br />\nfan will tell you, this is indeed a new season, and<br />\nthat means three months of lacrosse festivities to<br />\ntempt even the regulars of D-level. To try and provide you with insight into the Blue Jays competition,<br />\nhere is our second annual Pre-season lacrosse poll<br />\naccompanied by our expert analyses<br />\n1) Syracuse Orangemen:<br />\nLed by juniors Gary and Paul Gait, the Orange<br />\nreturn all but two of their starters from last year's<br />\nundefeated squad. Coach Roy Simmons Jr. will rely heavily on the explosive Gaits, who at times seem<br />\nto elevate the game to new levels. Gary Gait's<br />\nstatistics from last year catapulted him into a level<br />\noccupied by the greatest players ever, including<br />\nformer Syracuse standout Jim Brown. Gait also added<br />\npersonal innovation to the world of lacrosse with his<br />\nnow famous \"Air Gait\" maneuver, which he introduced during last year's Final Four.<br />\nBesides the Gaits, Syracuse will count heavily on<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022M=M\u2022lk._<br />\n<br />\na very experienced attack, including returning starters<br />\nGreg Burns, Jim Egan, and the colorful John \"Z\"<br />\nZulberti. With an experienced second unit, as well<br />\nas an offensively-minded midfield, goal scoring<br />\nshould continue in great numbers for Syracuse.<br />\nAt midfield, the Orange lost speedster Keith Owens,<br />\nstarter Brad Roos, as well as face-off specialist and<br />\nco-captain Bill Dirrigl. However, Rodney Dumpson,<br />\nEarl Hall, and junior-World player Freddie Amaya<br />\nare ready to establish themselves on the collegiate<br />\nlevel. Also, Joe Bonnaci, a two year starter at Navy,<br />\nhas transferred to Syracuse.<br />\nWith all of the blowouts and high scoring antics<br />\nprovided by the Orange last year, many people<br />\noverlooked their exceptional defense. The close<br />\ndefense of Mark Stopher, Jim McNamara, and Pat<br />\nMcCabe returns to the Dome. A strong recruiting<br />\nclass will provide insurance at the long stick position.<br />\nReturning in the net will be junior Matt Palumb,<br />\nwho brings a 17-1 career record into 1989. Jerry<br />\nDeLorenzo was one of last year's most highly regarded high school players; he also participated in the<br />\njunior World games. He might well be the top backup goalie in the nation.<br />\nOf note is the fact that during last season, Syracuse<br />\nplayed all of their games on artificial turf. Playing<br />\non turf allowed Syracuse to play a faster and more<br />\nexplosive game than would have been possible on<br />\ngrass, especially in foul conditions. This season,<br />\nhowever, they have six of their first eight games on<br />\nthe road, with all but one played on natural grass.<br />\nTheir opener at Homewood was the sole exception.<br />\n2) Johns Hopkins Blue Jays:<br />\nLed by returning first team All-Americans Dave<br />\nPietramala and Quint Kessenich, the one hundred<br />\nseventh edition of the Jays will look to capture their<br />\n43rd National Championship. Coach Don Zimmerman leads a squad with eleven returning seniors.<br />\n<br />\nThe attack will be led by sophomore stimuout Matt<br />\nPanetta, who showed last year (as well as in the fall)<br />\nthat he was ready to shoulder much of the scoring<br />\nload. He will be joined by seniors Jeff Ihm and John<br />\nCiccarone. Juniors Jay Clarke and Scott Marr will<br />\nalso see much playing time. Sophomore Mike Morrissey and freshmen Drew Burns and Jeff Wills will<br />\nprovide support as well.<br />\nThe midfield postition is well stocked, led by returning starters Brendan Kelly, John Dressel, and John<br />\nWilkins. Other seniors with Championship experience include Pat Russell and face-off artist Joe<br />\nRzempoluch. Junior Greg Kelly and sophomore Seth<br />\nTierney will also see a lot of work. A number of promising underclassmen will also compete at this position, especially freshman Brian Lukacz, who is<br />\nscheduled to start today against Syracuse.<br />\nThe defense, perhaps the strongest unit, returns<br />\nstarters Pietramala, Greg Lilly, and Steve Ciccarone.<br />\nSure to see a lot of action are senior Chip Dates and<br />\nsophomores Billy Dawn and Brian Voelker. Due to<br />\nknee injuries, both James DeTommaso and Dave<br />\nHowland will be sidelined for the entire '89 campaign, but they will both return for the 1990 season.<br />\nIn goal resides junior Kessenich, who many consider the team's most valuable player. He will try<br />\nto duplicate his first team All-American selection in<br />\nhis final two years of competition. He will be backed up by two promising freshmen, Scott Giardina<br />\nand Ian Hobbs.<br />\nWith their experienced and talented defensive<br />\ncorps, Hopkins will likely provide Syracuse with its<br />\nmost formidable competition on the road to Memorial<br />\nDay at College Park.<br />\n3) North Carolina Tar Heels:<br />\nCoach Willie Scroggs has thirty-three letterman<br />\nreturning to Chapel Hill to face the toughest<br />\nSee TOP FIFTEEN, 8<br />\n<br />\n\f8/MARCH 3, 1989<br />\n<br />\nFive other Hopkins opponents andfive Ivy League<br />\nTOP FIFTEEN, from 7<br />\nschedule of his eleven-year tenure. The attack will<br />\nbe led by returning starters Neil Redfern, John<br />\nSzczpinski, and Corey Gavitt. Other experienced<br />\nscorers are Mark Tummillo and Chris<br />\nGalgano. The midfield position suffered greatly at<br />\ngraduation with the loss of three All-Americans.<br />\nHowever, eleven returnees will provide Scroggs with<br />\na competitive middie corps who will be asked to fill<br />\nthis large vacancy. Returning seniors include John<br />\nLowe and Craig O'Callaghan.<br />\nOn defense, the lone returning starter is Paul Fitzpatrick. Other long sticks returning to Chapel Hill<br />\ninclude seniors Scott Price, Carlo Grohovac, and<br />\nGreg Vamos. With a number of talented<br />\nunderclassmen, this unit remains well stocked.<br />\nGoalie Barney Aburn, from Towson, had departed.<br />\nAburn set an ACC record and led the entire nation<br />\nin save percentage last year with a whopping .709.<br />\nAmong candidates to fill this large loss are Lars<br />\nPedersen and Pat Olmert.<br />\nThe Tar Heels are favored to defend last year's<br />\nACC Championship and earn a tenth consecutive<br />\nNCAA bid.<br />\n4) Virginia Cavaliers:<br />\nThis year, the Wahoos will look to improve on last<br />\nyear's successes. After a down year in 1987, UVa<br />\nrebounded with a fine season that saw them reach the<br />\nsemi-finals in the NCAA tournament.<br />\nCoach Jim \"Ace\" Adams (with over 250 career<br />\nwins) will field an attack corps led by Rob Schmalz,<br />\nTom Burt, and Jim Webster. Together with promising underclassmen, they will look to duplicate the<br />\nexploits gf Greg Sessa, Doug Amacher, and Chase<br />\nMonroe, all of whom left Charlottesville in 1988.<br />\nReturning middies will by led by Andy Kraus, a<br />\nfirst-team All-American, as well as Eric and David<br />\nPurdy, Steve Anderson, Tim Oursler, and the experienced Mike and David Smith. This unit comprises the strength of Virginia heading into 1989.<br />\n<br />\nThe defense is led by returning seniors John Chadwick, Charles White, Mike Dekshenieks, and Doug<br />\nCorrigan. With the aid of five returning juniors, it<br />\nappears that the Cavaliers will have little trouble<br />\nreplacing last year's starters Pete McSherry and Second-team All-American Rob Schupler.<br />\nLast year saw the departure of goalie Peter<br />\nSheehan; this, however, was not early enough for<br />\nHopkins. During last year's quarterfinals here at<br />\nHomewood, Sheehan put on a clinic as the Wahoos<br />\ndowned the Blue Jays in overtime, knocking Hopkins<br />\nout of the Final Four for the first time in years.<br />\nReplacing him this season will likely be Tom<br />\nGroenenger, a second-year player.<br />\n5) Maryland Terrapins:<br />\nAlthough last year's Maryland squad was indeed<br />\na major disappointment, many in College Park expect this season's edition to return to the competitive<br />\nlevel that marked the program just two years ago.<br />\nCoach Dick Edell has an experienced but young team<br />\nthat might very well surprise a few folks and make<br />\na run for the title in front of their own fans.<br />\nSuper-feeder Brendan Hanley has graduated, but<br />\nthe attack corps is still strong, led by sophomore stan-<br />\n<br />\nliatuqda<br />\nWiqe<br />\naqd<br />\nSpirits<br />\n<br />\nWIT<br />\nAlWHIE HOT<br />\nir<br />\n<br />\n- /\u2022<br />\nl'fhAt<br />\n<br />\nk<br />\n,<br />\n'<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\nRotunda Mall<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCAL DOMINOS ME<br />\nINEP011\u2022<br />\n<br />\nADD ONE FRE<br />\nAdd one free topping of<br />\nyour choice with the<br />\npurchase of any pizza.<br />\nOne coupon per pizza.<br />\nOw drivers cony less Ihen<br />\nUmiasd delivery area_<br />\n<br />\nCall us!<br />\n338-2<br />\n500<br />\n2722 Remington Avenue<br />\n<br />\ndout Rob Wurzburger, last season's leading scorer.<br />\nAlso starting up front will be sophomore Mark<br />\nDouglas and junior Steve Young.<br />\nThe middies will greatly miss Tom Worstell, who,<br />\nbehind the Gaits, was probably the most complete<br />\nmidfielder in the nation last season. Returning for<br />\nhis final season at College Park is co-captain Phil<br />\nWilliard. He will be joined by his younger brother<br />\nDave, as well as junior Chris Connor.<br />\nDefense is led by co-captains Scott Wheeler and<br />\nfellow senior Jeff McNeil. Junior Bill Ralph will<br />\nround out the starting close defense. Two notable longstick departures are Doug Poindexter and third-team<br />\nAll-American Dan Coughlan.<br />\nIn goal for the Terps will be sophomore Mike<br />\nMcCanna from Catonsville. He takes over for Dennis Sullivan, who had difficulty replacing the sensational Jim Beardmore.<br />\n6) Navy Midshipmen:<br />\nCoach Bryan Matthews led the Middies to the<br />\nNCAA's last year, where they lost to eventual champ<br />\nion Syracuse in the quarterfinals. However, there<br />\nwas much cause for cheer in Annapolis with wins<br />\nover perennial powers Army, Virginia, and<br />\nMaryland. In 1989, Navy will rely on a very talented<br />\nand veteran scoring threat to shadow their lack of<br />\ndefensive experience.<br />\nTheir attack is led by sophomore and second-team<br />\nAll-American Mike Herger. Alongside Herger will<br />\nbe senior Paul Basile and junior Brain Keith, an<br />\nhonorable mention All-American.<br />\nMidfield saw the departure of standout Frank<br />\nSnyder, but capable replacements await. This year's<br />\nmidfield will be anchored by seniors Jeff Scott, Tom<br />\nHanzsche, Ed Iocco, Marvin Campbell, and Brian<br />\nSullivan. Many promising underclassmen will also<br />\nsee action here.<br />\nThough the defense suffered the loss of Jim Darcy and Mick Amatuccio, ten letter-winners return.<br />\nAmong those back for another season are seniors<br />\nMark Kapral, Dan Smalley, Tony Iuculano, Shan<br />\nSee TOP FIFTEEN, 9<br />\n<br />\n4...a\u2022Neuenumusasu<br />\n<br />\n(within walking distance)<br />\n<br />\n711 W. 40th Street<br />\n467-7777<br />\n\u2022 Students Welcome<br />\nBeer on Sale All the Time<br />\nQuantity and Party Discounts<br />\nTuesdays and Wednesdays 10% Off<br />\nAll Wines, Excluding Sales<br />\nChecks and Charges Accepted<br />\n<br />\n\fLACROSSE .89/9<br />\n<br />\nschools round out the top fifteen<br />\nTOP FIFTEEN, from 8<br />\nByrne, and Joe Schweitzer.<br />\nUndoubtedly the biggest loss that Navy had at<br />\ngraduation was the departure of honorable mention<br />\nAll-American goalie Joe Donnelly. Not only will his<br />\nperformance on the field be missed, but also his<br />\npresence as team leader. He will be replaced by either<br />\njunior Louis Brown or senior Tim McElligatt.<br />\n7) University of Pennsylvania Quakers:<br />\nCoach Tony Seaman's squad tied Yale for last<br />\nyear's Ivy Championship and fell one goal short of<br />\nknocking off Syracuse in the semifinals of last years<br />\nNCAA tournament. The big loss is at the midfield,<br />\nwhere Ivy Player of the Year and first-team AllAmerican Chris Flynn has graduated and taken his<br />\ntalents to the New England Patriots.<br />\nPeter Smith, Steve Stoll, John Lyons, and Chris<br />\nConforti lead the attack. Smith, a second team AllIvy selection, will be counted on to do most of the<br />\nscoring. The midfield position is led by Stewart<br />\nFisher, a returning All-American, as well as John<br />\nGreco. Ed McMahon and Keith McCartney, both<br />\nAll-American caliber defensemen, departed last year.<br />\nSenior Paul Konkel is the lone remaining starter. In<br />\ngoal will be sophomore Jeremy Sigler, replacing the<br />\ntalented John Kanaras.<br />\n8) Cornell Big Red:<br />\nAlas, Coach Richie Moran will be without the exploits of attackman Tim Goldstein. He held Cornell's march to the Final Four both in 1987 and again<br />\nin 1988, only to fall to defeat in the final game of<br />\neach season.<br />\nBesides Goldstein, Cornell's attack will also be<br />\nwithout honorable mention All-American John Wurzburger. This season, the scoring load will be carried by senior Steve \"the Stork\" Meyer, as well as<br />\njunior Bill O'Hanlon.<br />\nMidfield will be directed by another All-American<br />\nhonorable mention, junior Vince Angotti. He will<br />\nbe teamed with senior Tim McDevitt and junior Mike<br />\nCummings.<br />\nWith the departure of the majority of Cornell's offense at graduation, the Big Red will rely on a formidable defense to combat their Ivy and non-Ivy foes.<br />\nThe long sticks are led by junior John Rossettie and<br />\nsophomore Pat Leahy. Once again, Cornell will be<br />\nanchored by goalie Paul Schmimoler, who last year<br />\nwas an honorable mention All-American.<br />\nCornell has a very rich lacrosse tradition, and<br />\nCoach Moran has captured fifteen Ivy titles in his<br />\ntwenty years at the helm. If his young attack can play<br />\neffectively, Cornell may indeed return for its third<br />\ntrip to the finals in the last three years.<br />\n9) Massachusetts Minutemen:<br />\nAlthough not as deep as many of the traditional<br />\nlacrosse powers of the mid-Atlantic and New York<br />\nregions, the Minutemen have an experienced and<br />\n<br />\ntalented nucleus that Coach Dick Garber hopes<br />\nwill carry them into the NCAA's. They don't begin<br />\ncompetition until the end of March, when they travel<br />\nto California, but their schedule includes top teams<br />\nsuch as Cornell, Brown, and Syracuse.<br />\nThe attack is led by third-team All-American Scott<br />\nHiller, who has replaced Tom Carmean as UMass's<br />\ntop scoring threat. He is teamed with honorable mention All-American Jim NIcAleveay. UMass suffered<br />\na great loss with the departure of long stick middie<br />\nGlenn Stephens. The minutemen will count on a<br />\ntalented group of young players to mature at the midfield position. Indeed, this is the key to their playoff<br />\nasperations.<br />\nOn the defensive end, UMass is well stocked.<br />\nAlthough Matt Woods is gone, they are anchored<br />\nby goalie Sal LoCascio, last season's third-team AllAmerican. If the scorers and LoCascio can play up<br />\nto their potential and capable midfielders emerge,<br />\nthere may by much to cheer about in Amhearst.<br />\n10) Loyola Greyhounds:<br />\nThe Greyhounds are coming off a 12-2 season, including their first-ever berth in the NCAA tournament. Although many of last year's starters have<br />\ngraduated, their following on Charles Street is anticipating another post-season opportunity.<br />\nThey are led by attackman Mike Ruland, a second<br />\nteam All-American. Although small in stature, he<br />\nwill shoulder a great amount of the scoring responsibilities. He will have much influence in determining how far this squad will go in May.<br />\nThe starting midfield will be Brian Kroneberger,<br />\nBrian Letz, and Ted Nichols. This experienced group<br />\nwill be an asset to Coach Kadal.<br />\nThe defense is anchored by Mike Ready and emerging sophomore Tom Johnson. Although second-team<br />\nAll-American goalie Tim McClelland has departed,<br />\nthe capable Charlie Tooney is eager to show many<br />\nthat he too can lead Loyola to the playoffs.<br />\n11) Harvard Crimson:<br />\nYes, that Harvard! After last season's explosion<br />\ninto the playoffs, Cambridge is buzzing about the<br />\nCrimson's chances this year. Rooie Coach Scott<br />\nAnderson led Harvard to and 11-4 record, good for<br />\na first round NCAA game against Navy, which they<br />\nlost in overtime.<br />\nThree starters return as attack, led by 1988 Ivy<br />\nRookie of the Year and honorable mention AllAmerican Mickey Cuvotti. He is teamed with Ivy<br />\nstandout junior David Kramer, as well as senior Brad<br />\nRaymond.<br />\nJunior Perry Dodge leads a very experienced midfield unit which also boasts three returning starters.<br />\nThe others are seniors Steve Lux and Rob Griffith.<br />\nTwo starters on defense are also back, juniors<br />\nChris Bentley and Mike Murphy.<br />\nThe only inexperienced position for the Crimson<br />\nthis year will be in goal, where All-Ivy performer<br />\nMike Bergmann has graduated. His likely replacement will by Tom Shebar.<br />\n112) Yale Elis:<br />\nSurprised? Well, so were many followers of the<br />\nlacrosse world after last year's Cinderella performance by these boys from New Haven. While many<br />\nopponents took them lightly, they played with intensity and skill on the way to a 12-4 record and the<br />\nnumber seven seed in the NCAA's. Now that Coach<br />\nMike Waldvogel and the rest of the Elis have had<br />\ntheir first taste of post-season play, they are sure to<br />\nhave a healthy appetite for more.<br />\nThe attack will need to rebuild after the departure<br />\nof three starters. Last year's attack combined for 108<br />\ngoals and 51 assists. Scoring will be supplied in<br />\nearnest by a very strong midfield corps. Junior John<br />\nReese was second in the Ivies in scoring last year,<br />\nand was .11so an honorable mention All-American.<br />\nHe is joined by senior Mike Babcock, another AllAmerican standout. The third starter is senior Keith<br />\nJoseph.<br />\nThe defense is led by junior Bryan Martin, yet<br />\nanother honorable mention All-American. In goal will<br />\nbe the Ivy leader in save percentage, junior Chris<br />\nSwanenburg. If the Elis can field three effective attackmen, they will demonstrate that 1988 was no<br />\nfluke.<br />\n<br />\n13) Rutgers Scarlet Knights:<br />\nCoach Tom Hayes leads 37 returning lettermen into the 71st campaign of Rutgers lacrosse. The attack<br />\nboasts the return of four of last year's top five<br />\nscorers. They will be led by Andy DeCicco, M.G.<br />\nHollingsworth, Steve Luciano, and Peter Tortorella.<br />\nUnlike teams of the past, this year's edition features<br />\na balanced offense, making it difficult for the opposition to key in on one particular threat.<br />\nThe midfield position is also loaded with veterans.<br />\nThey will be anchored by third team All-American<br />\nGreg Rinaldi, who led the Scarlet Knights in scoring a year ago. Another mainstay is tri-captain and<br />\nface-off man Lou Fusilli. The third starter is junior<br />\nDoug Beeler.<br />\nOn defense, only one starter has departed. The top<br />\nlong stick man is All-American Marc Moreau. He<br />\nwill be teamed with Jim Eckert and Tim Pritts.<br />\nIn goal, Rutgers lost standout Jim Gilman. There<br />\nwill be fierce competition among three hopefuls for<br />\nthe starting job.<br />\n14) Brown University Bruins:<br />\nThe fifth Ivy league squad in our poll may pull<br />\na few surprises before the season is over. Although<br />\nCoach Don Starsia lost some key performers from<br />\nlast season, sources close to lacrosse see the Bruins<br />\nas one of 1989's dark horses.<br />\nAt attack is honorable mention All-Ivy senior Jamie<br />\nMunro, who will be teamed with two young players.<br />\nSome of the scoring slack will be taken up by an<br />\nestablished midfield unit which features junior Rich<br />\nTuohey and sophomore May McMahon.<br />\nThe defense includes senior Dave Kotowski and<br />\njunior Lars Tiffany. They will be asked to fill the<br />\nvoid created by the departure of first team AllAmerican Bill McComas.<br />\nIn goal, replacing Jamie Smiles will be junior Steve<br />\nAyers, who was a starter for the Bruins as a freshman<br />\nduring their surprising year of 1987. Brown suffered<br />\nthree losses by only one goal last season. If they can<br />\ncome up on the winning end of these close battles<br />\nthey may well return to the NCAA tournament.<br />\n15) Army Cadets:<br />\nThe squad from West Point is hopeful that 1989<br />\nmight see the Cadets return to the NCAA tournament after a disappointing campaign a year ago.<br />\nCoach Jack Emmer has seventeen lettermen returning; there are, however, two very important absences<br />\nthis season. This first is Rob Betchley, a second team<br />\nAll-American attackman last year. He led the Cadets<br />\nin scoring and providing much frustration to Hopkins<br />\nplayers and coachers in his final three seasons. Also<br />\ngone is goalie Joel Portuese, who was the backbone<br />\nof the Army defensive corps.<br />\nOn attack, Army will be led by seniors Bill Tohill<br />\nand Scott Frank. They will be joined by sophomore<br />\nJohn Mone. Other performers without varsity experience should also see action.<br />\nThe middies are the most experienced unit of the<br />\nteam. They will be led by seniors John Sheehan,<br />\nMike Dieroff. and Steve Haugenes as well as junior<br />\nJoe Kane. Defensive middies include senior Pete<br />\nMavoides and juniors Joe Olmeda and Brian<br />\nNakamura.<br />\nOn defense will be seniors Buck French and Gary<br />\nGiglio. They will be matched with juniors John<br />\nO'Grady and Jim Williams. The competition for the<br />\nstarting goalie slot is between sophomore Rob Salter<br />\nand junior Joe Bruno.<br />\n<br />\n\f10/MARCH 3, 1989<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkin<br />\nHomewc<br />\nSaturday,<br />\n2:00<br />\n<br />\nMN& AjOriffis#<br />\nilir.4611111t<br />\nIP ~IP<br />\n<br />\nIk<br />\n<br />\nfrik<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins Blue Jays<br />\nProbable Starters<br />\n22<br />\n21<br />\n19<br />\n32<br />\n17<br />\n36<br />\n37<br />\n42<br />\n43<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nMatt Panetta<br />\nJeff lhm<br />\nJay Clarke<br />\nBrendan Kelly<br />\nJohn Wilkens<br />\nBrian Lukacz<br />\nGreg Lilly<br />\nSteve Ciccarone<br />\nDave Pietramala<br />\nQuint Kessenich<br />\n<br />\nAttack<br />\nAttack<br />\nAttack<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nDefense<br />\nDefense<br />\nDefense<br />\nGoalie<br />\n<br />\n\fLACROSSE '89/11<br />\n<br />\nins vs. Syracuse<br />\n,vood Field<br />\ny, March 4<br />\n10 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nPhoto by David Preece<br />\n<br />\nThe Syracuse Orangemen<br />\nProbable Starters<br />\n11<br />\n14<br />\n9<br />\n19<br />\n22<br />\n6<br />\n29<br />\n32<br />\n18<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nJohn Zulberti<br />\nJohn Burns<br />\nJim Egan<br />\nPaul Gait<br />\nGary Gait<br />\nRodney Dumpson<br />\nPat McCabe<br />\nMark Stopher<br />\nJim McNamara<br />\nMatt Palumb<br />\n<br />\nAttack<br />\nAttack<br />\nAttack<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nDefense<br />\nDefense<br />\nDefense<br />\nGoalie<br />\n<br />\n\f12/MARCH 3, 1989<br />\n<br />\n1988 Jays battled back in spite of poor start<br />\nby Andy Prior<br />\nThe Hopkins lacrosse season got off to a shaky<br />\nstart. Just one month into the season, the disciplinary<br />\nsuspension of three players, a 19-7 opening-day loss<br />\nto Syracuse University, and the resignation of three<br />\nadditional players had created a sense of turmoil.<br />\nDespite these set-backs, the Blue Jays managed to<br />\nregroup for nine consecutive wins to finish the regular<br />\nseason at 9-1, ranked second in NCAA Division<br />\nI. The Hopkins season ended abruptly, however,<br />\nwhen they were eliminated 11-10 in overtime by the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia in quarter-final play.<br />\nA month before the opener against Syracuse, star<br />\ngoalie Quint Kessenich was suspended for one game<br />\nby head coach Don Zimmerman. Kessenich and two<br />\nteammates, defensemen Dave Howland and James<br />\nDeTommaso, had damaged furniture in the lobby of<br />\nthe Northway Apartment building. Howland also<br />\nreceived a one-month suspension, while DeTommaso<br />\nwas suspended for two weeks.<br />\nThe absence of Kessenich (despite a commendable<br />\neffort by Jeff Kramer) and Howland, along with a<br />\nporous Jay defense, combined for the worst defeat<br />\nin fifteen years. It was Coach Don Zimmerman's<br />\nworst defeat in his five-year tenure and marked the<br />\nfirst time that the Jays had lost by more than four<br />\ngoals under his coaching. At one point during the<br />\ngame the Jays were unable to score for 32:56.<br />\nFollowing the 19-7 blowout against Syracuse, three<br />\nJays resigned from the squad for what were termed<br />\npersonal reasons.

Even though Chic<br />\nhad suffered two previous heart attacks, there was<br />\nno doubt in any of our minds that he was going to<br />\nbeat this illness. Chic almost always had a way to<br />\nbeat the odds and to win\u2014whether in sports, games<br />\nof chance, or any type of competition. But this time<br />\nChic lost the battle, and great sadness has come to<br />\nhis family, his friends, and the entire lacrosse world<br />\nwhere he made an indelible mark.<br />\nChic entered Hopkins in the fall of 1958. He played<br />\non the freshman football team under Bob Scott, who<br />\nrealized then that Chic was an outstanding athlete<br />\nand a dynamic leader. All of his teammates enjoyed<br />\nhis outgoing personality and his great sense of humor.<br />\nHe began his lacrosse career at Hopkins the following spring on the freshman team coached by Fred<br />\nSmith, who became one of Chic's staunchest supporters and his personal friend. Chic played three<br />\nyears on the varsity football team for Wilson Fewster<br />\nand led the Blue Jays to Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nchampionships in 1959 and 1960. He was named to<br />\nthe All-Conference team as a single-wing tailback.<br />\nHe called all the offensive plays and was the obvious<br />\nteam leader. Chic ran the show on the lacrosse field<br />\nas well, and it was there that he really excelled. He<br />\nwas an All-American midfielder during each of his<br />\nthree years on the varsity, was team captain, and winner of just about every Hopkins award\u2014Penniman<br />\nAward for the best midfielder, Turnbull-Reynolds<br />\nAward for leadership, Erlanger Award for the best<br />\nsenior player, and selection to the All-Time Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team.<br />\nWhen Chic finished his playing career in 1962,<br />\nathletic director Marshall Turner hired him as an<br />\nassistant coach in football, basketball, and lacrosse.<br />\nChic was always at his best when the pressure was<br />\non. Whether it was sending in the play on a crucial<br />\nfourth-down situation in football, or setting up the<br />\nlast shot in a tied basketball or lacrosse game, Chic<br />\nthrived on making the tough decision. And he was<br />\nso good at it. Not too many people are aware that<br />\nChic was the head coach of Hopkins varsity basketball for six years. His teams beat Loyola College<br />\nthree times, and his 1967-68 team won the MAC<br />\nSoutheast League championship.<br />\nAfter seven years on the athletic staff, Chic left<br />\nHomewood in the summer of 1969 for a position in<br />\nthe business world. He did assist in coaching the '71<br />\n<br />\nlacrosse team as a part-timer. When Marshall Turner<br />\nretired as athletic director and turned the job over<br />\nto Bob Scott in the summer of 1973, Chic was immediately called and asked to return as a full-time<br />\nassistant in 1974 and head coach in 1975.<br />\nHe agreed and then proceeded to establish a truly<br />\nremarkable record over a nine-year period. The<br />\nhighlights of that illustrious career include: Playing<br />\nin seven consecutive NCAA Championship games<br />\n(1977-83), winning three consecutive NCAA Championships(1978,'79,'80), compiling a record of 105<br />\nwins and 16 losses, coaching 23 first-team AllAmericans and four Division I Players-of-the-year.<br />\nWithout a doubt, Chic ranks as one of the game's<br />\nbest coaches of all time. He left no stone unturned<br />\nin his preparations for his team's next game. He was<br />\na very demanding, hard-driving coach who would<br />\naccept nothing but the best from his players. Every<br />\nounce of Chic's energy went towards winning. He<br />\nwould often arrive at his Hopkins office at 6 a.m.<br />\nand would routinely leave after 7:30 p.m. He was<br />\nas tough a competitor as there has ever been in the<br />\ncoaching ranks.<br />\nChic was recognized for his accomplishments on<br />\nthe lacrosse field when he was inducted into the<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse Hall of Fame on January 30, 1988. How<br />\npleased his family and friends were that this highest<br />\nlacrosse honor was awarded to him! And there<br />\nweren't two happier and more proud people that night<br />\nthan his parents. Mr. & Mrs. Ciccarone attended just<br />\nabout every game Chic played or coached, and they<br />\nalways beamed with pride over \"their Henry.\"<br />\nIn like fashion, Chic and his wife Sue took great<br />\npride in their four sons who grew up in the thick of<br />\nthe Hopkins tradition. But it's rather unique that all<br />\nfour boys wanted to go to the same school that their<br />\nfather attended and to also play for him on the<br />\nlacrosse field. Henry Jr. and Brent did play for their<br />\ndad, but John and Steve were denied that privilege<br />\nwhen Chic decided to enter the business world in the<br />\nfall of 1983. Both John and Steve will be playing<br />\ntheir senior years at Hopkins this spring.<br />\n. The Ciccarone legend lives on, as do the wonderful memories of Chic's friendship\u2014the light-up<br />\nsmile, the little stories, the laughs, and the warm<br />\nuplift that came from being with him.<br />\nPlans are being made for an appropriate memorial<br />\nfor Chic, along with a get-together on Friday night,<br />\nApril 28, prior to the Homecoming game with Navy.<br />\n<br />\n******************************<br />\n1988 DIVISION I<br />\nALL-AMERICANS<br />\nFIRST TEAM<br />\n* Attack: Mike Morrill (Johns Hopkins)<br />\n\u2022<br />\nJohn Zulberti (Syracuse)<br />\nTim Goldstein (Cornell)<br />\nMidfield: Gary Gait (Syracuse)<br />\nPaul Gait (Syracuse)<br />\nChris Flynn (Pennsylvania)<br />\nAndy Kraus (Virginia)<br />\n* Defense:Boyd Harden (North Carolina)<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDave Pietramala (Johns Hopkins)<br />\nBill McComas (Brown)<br />\n* Goalie: Quint Kessenich (Johns Hopkins)<br />\nHenry Ciccarone, Sr. 1938-1988.<br />\n<br />\nSECOND TEAM<br />\n* Attack: Mike Ruland (Loyola)<br />\nRob Betchley (Army)<br />\nMike Herger (Navy)<br />\n* Midfield: Brendan Kelly (Johns Hopkins)<br />\nTom Worstell (Maryland)<br />\nTim Mclntee (CW Post)<br />\nTim Welsh (North Carolina)<br />\n\u2022<br />\n* Defense:Mark Stopher (Syracuse)<br />\nRob Schulper (Virginia)<br />\nBill Pennoyer (Harvard)<br />\n* Goalie: Tom McClelland (Loyola)<br />\n<br />\nTHIRD TEAM<br />\n\u2022<br />\n* Attack: Chase Monroe (Virginia)<br />\nScott Hiller (Massachusetts)<br />\nAdam Puritz (Yale)<br />\n*<br />\n* Midfield: Greg Rinaldi (Rutgers)<br />\nKevin Haus (North Carolina)<br />\nPhil Willard (Maryland)<br />\nGordon Purdie (Adelphi)<br />\n\u2022<br />\n* Defense Dan Coughlan (Maryland)<br />\nEd McMahon (Pennsylvania)<br />\nJames DeTommaso (Johns Hopkins):<br />\n* Goalie: Sal LoCascio (Massachusetts)<br />\n******************************<br />\n<br />\n\f14/MARCH 3, 1989<br />\n<br />\nSyracuse thinks that they have the talent to repeat<br />\nCourtesy of Syracuse Sports Information Dept.<br />\nGreat expectations will usually do one of two<br />\nthings\u2014motivate to success or cause such pressure<br />\nthat the level of perfection expected is unattainable.<br />\nCoach Roy Simmons Jr.'s Syracuse Orangemen are<br />\nabout to discover which road they will travel this<br />\nseason.<br />\nBy acclamation, Syracuse is the preseason number<br />\none team in the country. The defending NCAA<br />\nchampions lost only two starters from last year's team<br />\nand more than one person in the lacrosse world has<br />\nsuggested that the number two team in the country<br />\nis SU's second team. The Orangemen return Player<br />\nof the Year Gary Gait, twin brother Paul, and Attackman of the Year John Zulberti. All three were<br />\nfirst-team All-Americans last year. Also back is<br />\nsecond-team All-American defenseman Mark<br />\nStopher and honorable mention picks defenseman Pat<br />\nMcCabe, MVP of the Junior World Games last summer, defenseman Phil Schluter, and attackman Greg<br />\nBurns. Returning in goal is the MVP of last year's<br />\nchampionship game, Matt Palumb, who brings a 17-1<br />\ncareer record into the season.<br />\nIt certainly would appear that another banner year<br />\nis in store for the Orange. Syracuse has made a national leading six straight trips to the Final<br />\nFour, and the only surprise would be if they didn't<br />\nmake number seven. But Head Coach Roy Simmons<br />\nJr. remains guarded when the subject of back-to-back<br />\nchampionships comes up.<br />\n\"A year ago, everyone thought we would be lucky<br />\nto be much over .500 because of the large graduation,\" said Simmons. \"But we were hungry, determined, and came out strong. All of the games were<br />\non synthetic surface, which allowed us to play the<br />\nuptempo game we like to play. We got the number<br />\none ranking right away with the win over Hopkins<br />\nand the 15 games on synthetic fields played right into<br />\nour hands. We escaped injuries, the chemistry was<br />\nright, and everyone was unselfish.<br />\n\"Now we've got a look-alike team and everyone.<br />\nexpects us to repeat. But if you look at it, we're playing the Tigers on the road instead of at home, five<br />\nof our first six games are on the road and six of our<br />\ngames this year are on grass. I realize it's going to<br />\nbe very difficult to repeat. Everyone will gear their<br />\nseason towards tripping Syracuse up.\"<br />\nThat may well be, but don't count on it happening very often. With the exception ofjust a few key<br />\npeople, the 1989 Orangemen are the same team as<br />\nthe 1988 Orangemen\u2014with an added year's experience. This is a team that handed Johns Hopkins<br />\nits only regular season loss, a 19-7 demolition at<br />\nHomewood. SU beat teams by an average of 10 goals<br />\na game, winning by such scores as 19-7, 23-8, and<br />\n23-5 over quality teams like Cornell, UMass and<br />\nNavy. Yet the Orange also showed it could win the<br />\ntough ones, beating North Carolina in overtime and<br />\nPenn in the final seconds of the NCAA semifinals.<br />\nFrom the 15-0 record to Gary Gait's \"Air Gait\"<br />\nleap into lacrosse history to the record crowd of<br />\n20,007 for the NCAA championship game in the Carrier Dome, 1988 was a very special year for Orange<br />\nlacrosse. Here is a look at the pieces that must come<br />\ntogether for Syracuse to keep the crown:<br />\n<br />\nof them are one-dimensional.\"<br />\n<br />\nhigh school All-American Freddie Amaya. The second midfield will be made up of whoever is left from<br />\nthat competition, with two pretty fair new faces coming into the picture. Joe Bonacci, a two-year starter<br />\nat Navy, has transferred to SU, as has junior college All-America Dan Caughey from Herkimer.<br />\nFaceoff duties appeared to be a lock for Kirk Pratt,<br />\nwho Bill Dirrigl said was the only center in the country who could beat him last year. But Pratt is being<br />\npressed by Mike Magee and Paul Cannon. All three<br />\nshould see some action.<br />\n<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nThe midfield suffered the most significant losses.<br />\nBill Dirrigl, one of the premier faceoff men in the<br />\ncountry and a co-captain, is gone, as is fellow cocaptain Neil Alt. Keith Owens led the Orangemen's<br />\nsecond midfield and his blinding speed will be missed<br />\nin man-down situations. Starter Brad Roos was the<br />\nperfect complement for the Gaits, with his size and<br />\ndefensive ability. Key losses, true, but will they be<br />\nenough to slow down the SU juggernaut?<br />\nThe Gaits are back and healthy and bring with them DEFENSE<br />\nWhile the Gaits and the rest of SU's high-powered<br />\na combined 117 goals from the 1988 season. Gary<br />\nis coming off one of the greatest seasons in lacrosse offense were getting the press and the accolades, the<br />\nhistory and Paul wants to show he can do more than Orange defense simply went out, game in and game<br />\nscore \"only\" 47 goals. These are probably the two out, and got the job done. Over the last 11 games of<br />\nfinest players in the country, if not beyond those the year, only Penn managed to score in double<br />\nfigures, squeaking through with 10 goals in the<br />\nboundaries.<br />\nSimmons: \"The Gaits are so complete, not only NCAA semifinal game.<br />\nSU's starting close defense returns intact, with se-4<br />\nwell versed in the game, but great, great athletes.<br />\nThey are the type of athletes that would be good at cond team All-American Mark Stopher, Jim<br />\nanything they decided to play.

We're expected to win and be a big, tough<br />\nguy, but you know on any given day, we might not<br />\nhave the hot hand. It's tough pressure for a young<br />\nboy.<br />\nN-L: Last year, you came to Homewood and handily defeated the Jays, and you've won the last three<br />\nmeetings between the two schools. To what do you<br />\nattribute your success against Hopkins in recent<br />\nyears?<br />\n<br />\nHomewood because it's dry and flat, and we like a<br />\nfast game. I kind of hoped that we could have the<br />\nhome field advantage, and we have a wonderful community who loves us. I always look forward to having the Jays to Syracuse, because it's a treat for<br />\neveryone. We always have a wonderful crowd of<br />\ntwelve to fifteen thousand, and we've been denied<br />\nthat opportunity this year because of an extended<br />\nbasketball season. We are obviously in the entertainment business like any other big university, and<br />\ntickets sell for basketball and football, and that's the<br />\nname of the game. With a nationally televised game<br />\nagainst Georgetown on Sunday, they didn't want to<br />\ndisturb the surface, so I was told to take a hike. To<br />\nsafeguard against that in the future, we changed our<br />\nschedule time with Johns Hopkins, and next year it<br />\nwill be in the third week of March so that basketball<br />\nseason will be over and there won't ever be a problem again about the Jays coming to Syracuse. But<br />\nthis year, I've got to come back to Homewood. Not<br />\nthat I dislike Homewood, but given my choice, I<br />\nwould definitely love to be in the Dome every game.<br />\nIt's warm, it's predictable, it's dry, it's wonderful<br />\nfor the crowd, it's great for the game, and we feel<br />\ncomfortable.<br />\n<br />\nabout the throwing of oranges and the prospect that<br />\nit may happen again this year?<br />\n<br />\nSimmons: That's the problem with being represented<br />\nby a piece of fruit. I always say I'm lucky that we<br />\ndon't represent a coconut or a watermelon, because<br />\nthey hurt more. Oranges have a great velocity to them<br />\nin the air, and I got hit in the back of the head with<br />\none. It's annoying at the time, because you're trying to do your best and coach a bunch of young kids,<br />\nand somebody's literally throwing garbage at you.<br />\nIt's not the first time and it won't be the last, but<br />\nit happens. I guess Hopkins is very gentle, because<br />\nI know they advertised in the paper for their kids<br />\nto bring only rotten oranges, and I thought that was<br />\nso much better than what the University of<br />\nMassachusetts did. They advertised to their student<br />\nbody to bring their oranges and make sure they were<br />\nfrozen. The food service at UMass couldn't believe<br />\nthat they'd gone through some ten thousand more<br />\noranges than normal the week before we came there.<br />\nThe kids would take the oranges from the food service and bring them back to their apartments to freeze<br />\nthem. We found much more oranges as UMass than<br />\nwe did at Johns Hopkins. I'm just afraid that someone<br />\nis going to get hit. They do pick up a great deal of<br />\nN-L: Last year, the Hopkins fans barraged the play- velocity in the air, and it's annoying. It works in our<br />\ning field with oranges before the game, and you were favor usually, because if the crowd doesn't stop they<br />\nhit with one on the sidelines. How do you feel<br />\n<br />\nSimmons: When the Blue Jays and I decided to get<br />\ntogether, there really wasn't much opportunity to<br />\nplay. In the past, we really weren't worthy of playing the Jays, and when we made our program a little stronger, they had a natural schedule and so did<br />\nwe. We had a hard time finding a slot where we could<br />\nget together, although we concurred that it was important that we play one another, The only date open<br />\nwas that first week in March, and most schools don't<br />\neven start that early. Everyone thought that I was<br />\na little crazy taking the Jays on that early and that,<br />\nwith us coming out of the snow belt and with them<br />\nhaving synthetic surface and being a so-called<br />\nSouthern team, they'd be a little better prepared. But<br />\nI think the time to catch the Jays, if there's such<br />\na thing, is while they're making some adjustments<br />\nin positions and building confidence. We caught them<br />\noff-guard, and that's all, but they never lost another<br />\nSYRACUSE, from 14<br />\nball game last year. They went all the way to the<br />\nVirginia game, and even that game they were short- of Bill.<br />\nThe defensive midfield will include co-captain<br />\nhanded and riddled with injuries at key positions, and<br />\nthat boiled down to a one-goal game.

Their<br />\nshots were a little bit off target, and ours were on GOAL<br />\nSyracuse has probably never had the kind of quality<br />\ntarget. Then they got behind, and we ran. We were<br />\nin shape and had a little more depth, I think. We got depth in the cage it has this year. Matt Palumb is<br />\nsome quick goals in the fourth period, and without coming off of an undefeated season and a brilliant<br />\nQuint [Kessenich] in the goals and with their other NCAA tournament, but right behind him are Lee<br />\nadjustments with some freshmen, they got caught that Hine and Jerry DeLorenzo. Hine was extremely efone afternoon. Then they went on, of course, to fective in his backup role last year and is having an<br />\nhave a great season. When you lose two games in one excellent preseason. DeLorenzo is one of the most<br />\nyear, at Hopkins maybe that's not a great year, but highly-touted young goalies in the country. He<br />\nfor anybody else in the book to have a complete teamed with Pat McCabe and Fred Amaya on the<br />\nseason and lose two ball games with as many injuries U.S. Junior World Team last summer and has been<br />\nas they had, it would be a great year.

This team did not go 15-0 against the Little<br />\nball team, you are forced to come to Baltimore for Sisters of the Poor last year; 1989 will be even<br />\nthe second straight season. Do you feel comfortable tougher. Nine of the 12 opponents made the NCAA<br />\nwith having to come to Homewood again?<br />\ntournament last year. The only Division III schools<br />\non the schedule are nine-time NCAA champion<br />\nSimmons: Yes. We love the Carrier Dome, and Hobart and perennial playoff contender Cortland, one<br />\nwe've only lost three games in nine years, so there's of only two schools to ever beat the Orange in the<br />\ngot to be something to being at home. It's a very, Carrier Dome.<br />\nvery fast surface [in the Dome], faster than<br />\nSU opens with road games against Johns Hopkins,<br />\n<br />\nNorth Carolina, and Adelphi, plays Cortland at home<br />\nand then hits the road again for Towson State at the<br />\nDay of Champions and Brown. Following a oneweek reprieve at home against Hofstra, it's off to<br />\nHobart. The Orange then plays Cornell, Rutgers, and<br />\nPenn at home before finishing the regular season at<br />\nUMass. It is a difficult scenario for a repeat of the<br />\nnational championship. Five of the first six\u2014and six<br />\nof the first eight\u2014games are on the road, and of the<br />\nroad games, only Hopkins plays on artificial turf.<br />\nThe championships? At Maryland, on grass.<br />\nWRAP-UP<br />\nNot too many people would argue that this is the<br />\nmost talented team in the country. Expectations are<br />\nhigh for Coach Simmons and his Orangemen and the<br />\npressure on themselves to try and build upon a 15-0<br />\nnational championship season may be the greatest<br />\npressure of all. This team isn't just favored to win<br />\nthe national championship, it is supposed to win the<br />\nnational championship. If they do, they were supposed to. If they don't, it will be \"what went<br />\nwrong?\"<br />\n\"Any pressure we feel will be what we put on<br />\nourselves,\" said Simmons. \"Self-fulfillment. How<br />\ndo you go further than an unbeaten national championship? You go out and try to do it again. We're<br />\neager to do it.<br />\n\"It was an awful struggle to get where we are and<br />\nnow we're going to have to work even harder to<br />\nmaintain it. I always hope to get the final four.

But<br />\nit's a shame. We used to be represented by an Indian, which is certainly fitting for lacrosse being that<br />\nthe native Americans were Indians, but we were forced like so many other colleges to drop our logo.<br />\nBecause we have an orange jersey, somebody said<br />\none day, \"Well, we'll be the Orangemen, as in an<br />\norange.' As a result, I've been pelted for the last ten<br />\nor twelve years quite regularly. But fan is short for<br />\nfanatic, and they really get into it and think it's funny. And it isn't so funny. They used to throw bananas<br />\nat Patrick Ewing, and that's just an awful insult. I<br />\nremember when Sonny Dove played basketball and<br />\nthey used to let doves go in the coliseum. I guess<br />\nthe fans are imaginative and sometimes cruel. They<br />\nplayers are there to play the game the best that they<br />\nknow how. They really work at it, and they don't<br />\nlike the game interrupted and stalled. We don't like<br />\nto get hit, and of course to hit the coach was probably a great feather in somebody's cap. The Hopkins<br />\nfans are overzealous, and I accept that. You feel like<br />\na gladiator when you're in that situation, because you<br />\nreally can't control it. I felt very bad for Mr. Scott,<br />\nwho is a great sportsman and a wonderful gentleman,<br />\nbecause he was very upset.

Did you feel that the final four was missing something without the Blue Jays last year?<br />\nSimmons: Yes. When you talk about lacrosse, it's<br />\nsynonymous with the Blue Jays. If they're not the<br />\nboss, they stub their toe at the very last minute, with<br />\nsomebody taking it away from them by a goal or two.<br />\nIt's unique. I am so proud of our several national<br />\nchampionship trophies, and other schools don't have<br />\nany. And then when I step into the Newton White<br />\nAthletic Center and I look into the case and see that<br />\nlineup, it looks like a depository of nationai championship trophies that maybe a distributor might have.<br />\nThat's reality. They've been the boss, and they'll<br />\nconsider to be one of the best. We have all the respect<br />\nin the world for them.<br />\nN-L: What are your opinions of this year's Hopkins<br />\nsquad and how do you see this year's match-up between the Jays and the Orangemen?<br />\n<br />\nSimmons: I think they're very strong defensively, and I happen to personally know a bunch of kids<br />\nthey've got because we recruited them. If! wanted<br />\nthem and they were certainly good enough to play<br />\nfor me, they're going to come back to haunt me.

You've got Greg<br />\nKelly there, a big kid from St. Anthony's on Long<br />\nIsland who we had hoped to get into an Orange jersey<br />\nalso, but he's a Blue Jay now, and I think he's going to be a big part of of this 1989 Hopkins team.<br />\nSo we're familiar with the personnel.

Even worse, you might have to sit in the<br />\nend zone, or on the side away from the benches,<br />\nwhere visiting fans usually sit. (The University, in<br />\nanticipation of large crowds, has installed additional<br />\nbleachers on the away side, but those also fill up<br />\nquickly for big games.) Also, remember to dress for<br />\nthe weather, as early season games can be brutally<br />\ncold.

Players from both teams charge<br />\ntoward the sideline where the ball has gone out of<br />\nbounds.

So I pretty much know of a loose ball or when the ball is in flight within<br />\nthe personnel of the team [Hopkins], but I don't know five yards of the player.<br />\nthe chemistry of the team and how they play together.<br />\n*Personal fouls: These include illegal bodycheckI know who they have. I know of people like Jay<br />\nClarke and Quint, and of course you've got the<br />\nnumber one defenseman in the nation [Dave<br />\nPietramala], and he's a New York state boy that<br />\nwe've seen play a lot. So we know what we're walking into, we just don't know how it's put together,<br />\nand we'll probably have to make some adjustments<br />\non the fourth [March].<br />\n<br />\nSimmons predictions<br />\n<br />\nN-L: If you were to make any predictions about<br />\nteams to watch this year, particularly any sleeper<br />\nteams, what would they be and why?<br />\nSimmons: Well, I think Brown is going to be the<br />\nstrong Ivy League team this year. I know Yale came<br />\nout strong last year, and Penn was obviously very<br />\nstrong. I think the Ivies could be represented by<br />\nBrown University this year. I think they had a very<br />\nyoung team [last year], but I think they've matured<br />\nenough now to be a real force. I think in the North<br />\nEast, that's the team that could be there. From your<br />\nway down, I know that Virginia has some fine personnel, and I think that once they develop a lot of<br />\nconfidence in themselves and one another, they could<br />\nbe a real force to be dealt with. And North Carolina<br />\nis always strong. It's hard to say, but I think Virginia<br />\nand Brown were two teams that were almost there<br />\nlast year, and those would be my guesses.<br />\n<br />\ning, slashing, crosse-checking, tripping, unnecessary<br />\nroughness, unsportsmanlike conduct, and the use of<br />\nan illegal crosse. Watch for these to see just what<br />\nthey are. There is a lot of subjectivity in the calling<br />\nof these fouls\u2014it depends mostly on the mood of the<br />\nreferees. The penalty for a personal foul is suspension from the game for one to three minutes, depending on the severity of the foul. The offender's team<br />\nplays short-handed during the penalty.<br />\n*Expulsion fouls: A player will be suspended for<br />\nthe remainder of the game for really nasty attempts<br />\nto injure or for committing five personal fouls.<br />\nHowever, the penalized team is allowed to substitute<br />\nfor the expelled player.<br />\n*Technical fouls: These are less serious fouls and<br />\nother rules violations. These include interference,<br />\nillegal screening, holding, pushing, touching the ball<br />\nwith the hands, withholding the ball from play,<br />\nthrowing the crosse, illegal procedure (a very broad<br />\ncategory, indeed), stalling, illegal equipment, and<br />\ncrease violations. The penalty for a technical foul<br />\nis either a 30-second penalty (if the offending team<br />\ndoes not have possession of the ball at the time the<br />\nfoul is committed) or simply loss of possession of<br />\nthe ball (if the offending team does have possession.)<br />\n*Penalty enforcement: A penalized player will<br />\nremain off the field (and his team plays one man<br />\ndown)for the duration of the penalty time unless the<br />\nother team scores a goal or the penalized team gains<br />\npossession of the ball in its attack goal area.<br />\n*Out of bounds: When the ball is thrown out of<br />\nbounds by one team, possession is awarded to the<br />\nother team, unless the ball was deemed a shot-ongoal that went out-of-bounds. In this case, possession is awarded to the team, one of whose in-bounds<br />\nplayers was closest to the ball when it crossed the<br />\nboundary line.<br />\n*Crease Privileges:No opposing player is allowed<br />\nin the goal crease area at any time. They may reach<br />\ninto the crease with their sticks to play a loose ball,<br />\nas long as they don't make contact with the goalie<br />\nor his stick. Furthermore, a defending player, including the goalkeeper, with the ball in his possession, may not enter the goal-crease area. Nor may<br />\nhe remain in the goal-crease area in possession of<br />\nthe ball longer than four seconds.<br />\n*Time-outs: Each team is allowed to call two<br />\ntimeouts per half and one per each sudden-death<br />\nperiod. Timeouts can be called when the ball is dead<br />\nby either team or by the team with the possession<br />\nof the ball in the attacking half of the field. The coach<br />\nor the captain of the team can call a timeout.<br />\nWell, there you have some of the basic rules of<br />\nthe game of lacrosse. Some of them may seem sort<br />\nof strange to those of you who are new to the sport,<br />\nbut after you see a few games, you'll get the hang<br />\nof it and even start second guessing the refs (who<br />\nare almost never right, anyway).<br />\n<br />\n\fA look at the 1989 women's lacrosse team<br />\n<br />\nPhotos by Bob Nelson<br />\n<br />\nWOMEN'S LACROSSE<br />\n1989 SCHEDULE<br />\nTues., Mar. 14\u2014at Notre Dame-4:00 p.m.<br />\nFri., Mar. 17\u2014home vs. Washington College4:00 p.m.<br />\nSat., Mar. 25\u2014home vs. Roanoke-11:00 a.m.<br />\nMon., Mar. 27\u2014home vs. Plymouth State-7:00 p.m.<br />\nFri., Mar. 31\u2014home vs. Haverford-4:00 p.m.<br />\nTue., Apr. 4\u2014home vs. Dickinson-6:30 p.m.<br />\nThu., Apr. 6\u2014at Gettysburg-3:30 p.m.<br />\nSat., Apr. 8\u2014home vs. Swarthmore-11:00 a.m.<br />\nTue., Apr. 11\u2014at Western Maryland-4:00 p.m.<br />\nSat., Apr. 15\u2014at Franklin & Marshall-11:00 a.m.<br />\nMon., Apr. 17\u2014home vs. Widener-7:00 p.m.<br />\nWed., Apr. 19\u2014at Mary Washington-4:00 p.m.<br />\nSat., Apr. 22\u2014home vs. Hood-11:00 a.m.<br />\nTue., Apr. 25\u2014home vs. Georgetown-4:00 p.m.<br />\nFri., Apr. 28-Sun., Apr. 30\u2014MCWLT Tournament<br />\n<br />\nLookfor the women's lacrosse preview in next week's News-Letter!<br />\nri,44,****444,4\u201e44\u202244,4,\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n*<br />\n** Good Luck Jays! i<br />\nthe<br />\n**<br />\n*<br />\nfrom<br />\n\u2022<br />\ni<br />\n*<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nP.J.'s Pub<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter wishes<br />\nBlue Jays success in<br />\ntheir quest for the 1989<br />\nNCAA lacrosse title.<br />\nAttention Fans!!<br />\nBe sure to come out tomorrow at 2 PM to cheer the<br />\nJays on to a crushing home<br />\nvictory over Syracuse!!<br />\nu ON JAY !<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022*<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n'p\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCRUSH<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n4,<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022*<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 THE ORANGE! .<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n*\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022*<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n'p<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSee You After<br />\nThe Game<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n4,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n******************************************0*<br />\n<br />\n\f20/MARCH 3, 1989<br />\n<br />\nThe Second Annual Lax Quiz<br />\nWin a stick from<br />\nby Michael Farbowitz<br />\n<br />\nSponsored by STX<br />\n\"The world's standard of excellence in lacrosse\"<br />\n<br />\nAh, Springtime.

The School of<br />\nMedicine will provide some $20<br />\nmillion of this fund.<br />\nThis reserve fund, while providing temporary Universitywide monies to bail out Arts and<br />\nSciences, will preserve Hopkins's<br />\ntradition of decentralization, in<br />\nwhich each division must be<br />\nfinancially self-sufficient.<br />\nAs part of an effort to identify<br />\nessential programs, Arts and<br />\nSciences is expected to reduce its<br />\nfaculty<br />\nsize,<br />\nincrease<br />\nundergraduate enrollment, and<br />\npostpone indefinitely construction<br />\nand renovation on the Homewood<br />\ncampus. A two-tiered tuition<br />\nsystem, set at $13,000 for continuing students and $14,000 for<br />\nnew students in the 1989-90<br />\nacademic year, will also be<br />\nimplemented.<br />\nThe Board's approval of the<br />\nplan was expected. According to<br />\nRoss Jones, vice president and<br />\nsecretary of the Board of<br />\nTrustees, \"There was a lot of<br />\nwork done by the Trustees in<br />\nreviewing the plan for several<br />\nmonths before the meeting, so<br />\nthat there was a rather good<br />\nunderstanding [of it] before<br />\n[Wednesday's] meeting.\"<br />\nYoung Trustee Stephanie<br />\nWeissman, interviewed after the<br />\nmeeting, said, \"I think people are<br />\nconcerned about the problems<br />\nthat lie behind the plan, but it was<br />\nneeded and we approved it.\"<br />\nAs the trustees met behind closed doors in the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library's Garrett<br /><br />\nRoom, undergraduates rallied<br />\noutside in a protest organized by<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nExpressing their concern over<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan, students<br />\ndecried their exclusion from the<br />\nplan's development.

He had given no signals that<br />\nsuch a move was forthcoming. After<br />\neighteen years at Hopkins, it is difficult<br />\nto imagine what the University will be<br />\nwithout him.<br />\nHaving presided over the University<br />\nduring a period of tremendous growth<br />\nand expansion, Muller shaped his position with an unique vision. The past two<br />\ndecades have seen unprecedented acquisitions and development. Among the<br />\nmore notable accomplishments were the<br />\nestablishment of the Bologna and Nanjing Centers, Hopkins' alliance with<br />\nPeabody, and the establishment of the<br />\nHubble Space Telescope. Alongside<br />\nthese accomplishments, Muller has the<br />\ndistinction of having spearheaded the<br />\nmost successful fundraising campaign in<br />\nHopkins history. Muller has also implemented major changes in the administrative and physical structure of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nThe president's position has grown<br />\nand expanded along with the University. Gone are the days when students can<br />\nexpect the president to actually live in<br />\nthe president's house. The role has gone<br />\nfrom one of close contact with students<br />\nand faculty at Homewood to one with<br />\na much broader perspective. Muller,<br />\nwith responsibilities and obligations to<br />\na much larger system, has had neither<br />\nthe time nor, arguably, the inclination<br />\nto attend to Homewood as much as the<br />\ncommunity here would have liked.<br />\nMuller has never made any bones<br />\nabout the fact that Homewood is just one<br />\nof many stars in the \"Hopkins galaxy\".<br />\nHe has even gone so far as to tell<br />\nfreshmen at his traditional Orientation<br /><br />\nspeech that they should not expect to see<br />\nhim more than twice in their college<br />\ncareer: when they enter, and when they<br />\nleave.<br />\nWhile this distance is understandable,<br />\nit has been disconcerting as well. Divisions, particularly the undergraduates at<br />\nHomewood, have felt the need for a<br />\nreassuring day-to-day administrative<br />\npresence. To this end, Muller's delegation of these responsibilities to Provost<br />\nJohn Lombardi in November was a step<br />\nin the right direction. Essentially Lombardi, for all intents and purposes, is<br />\nnow Homewood's president.<br />\nMuller's institutionalized distance has<br />\nensured that the transition period will<br />\nnot be especially tumultuous. Because<br />\nthe newly distanced president has, outside of financial or policymaking decisions, little direct effect upon the<br />\nundergraduates at Homewood, Muller's<br />\nresignation means little in operational<br />\nterms.<br />\nThis is not to diminish the role of the<br />\npresidency; the functions it performs,<br />\nespecially in the areas of fundraising,<br />\nimage-projecting, and providing an<br />\noverall cohesion for the University, are<br />\ninvaluable ones. This is only to say that<br />\nfor undergraduates, the more essential<br />\nquestions to be addressed will continue<br />\nto be addressed by the provost rather<br />\nthan by the president. Thus, we will not<br />\nlikely feel the effects of a change of<br />\npresident as much as we probably would<br />\nhave two decades ago.<br />\nAs the quest for Muller's replacement<br />\nbegins, we wish the search committee<br />\nwell and hope that the replacement will<br />\nexhibit at least as much vision and ability as Muller did. In these deficit days,<br />\nthese will be necessary qualities.<br /><br />\nProtesting the Plan<br />\nLast Wednesday was an unusually exciting one here at Homewood. The<br />\nlibrary, not surprisingly, served as the<br />\nmajor site of activity. The Garrett Room<br />\nhoused a full meeting of the Board of<br />\nTrustees in which the controversial<br />\nFive- Year financial plan was approved. Down the hall, President Steven<br />\nMuller announced his resignation to a<br />\npacked room of reporters and<br />\ncameramen. And all the while, outside<br />\nin the intermittent drizzle marched<br />\nstudents carrying placards back and<br />\nforth, protesting.<br />\nThe students were expressing concern<br />\nabout the Five-Year Plan and its<br />\nramifications. They were specifically<br />\nreacting against their lack of involvement in the drafting of the plan and<br />\ndemanded that they have some input in<br />\nits implementation.<br />\nDuring a day in which Hopkins's<br />\nname figured prominently in the media,<br />\nthese students managed to secure at least<br />\nas much attention as the other issues.<br />\nThat they attracted the media eye had<br />\nmuch to do with their organization and<br />\ndemands. Their protest came on the<br />\nheels of a rally the night before in which<br /><br />\nstudents, faculty, and staff had voiced<br />\nconcerns. Apparently, the audience was<br />\nmotivated enough to circulate petitions<br />\nthat evening and to gather the following morning to bring their concerns<br />\ndirectly to the Trustees.<br />\nCredit must go to Student Council<br />\nPresident Lou Giangiulio and a score of<br />\nothers for staging the event which,<br />\nunlike student debacles of the recent<br />\npast, was conducted in an efficient<br />\nfashion. What is more, from early indications, they seem to have gotten what<br />\nthey wanted.<br />\nProvost John Lombardi has agreed to<br />\nmeet with Council next Wednesday to<br />\ndiscuss in greater detail their demands<br />\nand in addition will hold a series of<br />\n\"town meetings\" on plan implementation.<br />\nWe are heartened by both this responsible display of student activism and by<br />\nthe speedy response of the administration. Certainly, the restrictions the FiveYear Plan are placing upon the community call for cooperation among all<br />\nsectors of society.

Feed<br />\na plant too little, it dies. Feed it<br />\ntoo much, you do.<br />\nUnder the direction of Jill<br />\nEhnenn, Little Shop, which plays<br />\nthrough Sunday, is one of the<br />\nmore memorable works the Barnstormers have produced, not just<br />\nfor its technical complexity but<br />\nfor its consistently strong acting.<br />\nIn resisting the temptation to<br />\nmock the script's outlandishness,<br />\nthe cast gives a sweet, honest portrayal of a botanical nightmare.<br />\nWritten by Howard Ashman<br />\nand Alan Menken, Little Shop<br />\nhad a long Off-Broadway run<br />\nbefore it hit the big screen-. It is<br />\na period piece, taking place \"in<br />\nthe decade not too long before our<br />\nown,\" but most of the jokes are<br />\ntimeless. Though the Barnstormers' production hews closely to the movie's comedic style,<br />\nit retains the original ending,<br />\nwhich will surprise those who<br />\nsaw only the movie.<br />\nThe musical chronicles the rise<br />\nof Seymour Krelborn (Jim<br />\nStofan), a meek Skid Row florist<br />\nclerk who nurses a rare plant to<br />\nboth health and impossible size.<br />\nWhile Seymour gains local and<br />\nnational renown, his love interest<br />\nAudrey (Kathy Kenrw,dy), a coworker, slowly becomes attracted<br /><br />\nto him.<br />\nAs the plant grows, Mr.<br />\nMuchnik (Jason Katz), the plant<br />\nshop owner, sees a gold mine in<br />\nthe plant and starts to baby<br />\nSeymour, without whose plant<br />\nthe store cannot survive.<br />\nMuchnik does not understand<br />\nemployee devotion, only the bottom line.<br />\nThe attention, of course, confuses Seymour. Unfamiliar with<br />\nsuccess, Seymour confronts<br />\nfame, respect, and love, not just<br />\nfrom the store's customers and<br />\nSkid Row derelicts, but from the<br />\nmedia. He soon feels as if he has<br />\nlost control of his life, as if his<br />\nsuccess is measured by the<br />\nnotoriety and size of his plant (it<br />\nis).<br />\nAudrey, meanwhile, is directionless. Heavily made-up, wearing dime-store clothing, she dates<br />\nOrin Scrivello, D.D.S. (Jeremy<br />\nGolub), a biker by night and a<br />\nsadistic dentist by day, who inhales laughing gas for pleasure.<br />\nAudrey is no dumb blonde, but<br />\nresists using her intelligence and<br />\nexpressing her inner warmth.<br />\nThen comes the plant. Seymour<br />\nnames it Audrey II, after guess<br />\nwho, when the plant is still a<br />\nbaby. Unlike its namesake,<br />\nAudrey II is ugly, with a mouth<br />\nas fresh as it is big. Audrey H eats<br />\nhuman blood, which Seymour<br />\nprovides until the plant gets too<br /><br />\nbig.<br />\nAudrey H goes through four incarnations, from baby at the<br />\nbeginning to slightly-bigger-thanbaby at the finale. Though more<br />\nimposing at the end, Audrey II is<br />\nperhaps most interesting in its second incarnation, when it seems<br />\nto dance by itself in Seymour's<br />\narms.<br />\nPlaying Seymour, Stofan is appropriately meek. Possessing<br />\nthick glasses, a protruding lower<br />\nlip, and hair that can charitably<br />\nbe called a mistake, he certainly<br />\nlooks the part, though the \"real\"<br />\nSeymour lives behind the glasses,<br />\nas Audrey finds out.<br />\nStofan's body language provides an amusing added dimension to the comedy, particularly<br />\nhis limp pose as Audrey sings<br />\n\"Suddenly Seymour.\" In all,<br />\nStofan seems even a little too<br />\nagile for his role\u2014perhaps a few<br />\nmore displays of Seymour's inherent clumsiness might have<br />\nhelped.<br />\nYet the high-pitched, nervous<br />\ntremor in Seymour's voice constantly highlights his growing<br />\nuncertainty over his newfound<br />\nsuccess. Stofan is at his best in his<br />\ninterplay with boss Mushnik in<br />\n\"Mushnik and Son,\" when<br />\nSeymour seems to confuse his<br />\nboss's likes for him and his plant.<br />\nThe role of Mushnik is weaker<br />\nto begin with, alternating between<br /><br />\nFrears' Technicolor Tomfoolery<br />\nby David Dudley<br />\n\"Costume Drama\" is a term<br />\noften now consigned to a distant<br />\npast of day-glo Technicolor extravaganzas based on books you<br />\nnever liked in high school.<br />\nEverybody talked like Emily<br />\nBronte and wore fabulously illogical clothing. The men had<br />\npowdered wigs and make-up, the<br />\nwomen were bound in hoopskirts<br />\nand nightmarish trusses and carried small dogs on velvet pillows.<br />\nNo one ever got shot. They were<br />\nunpleasant, turgid affairs, but<br />\nyour parents liked them. Stephen<br />\nFrears's Dangerous Liaisons has<br />\nall of these things, and more. It's<br />\ngot good ol' American actors<br />\ndressed like foppish Frenchpeople, heaving constrained breasts,<br />\nvengeful domineering women,<br />\nthe occasional grimy peasant,<br />\ncunning references to semi-legal<br />\nsex acts, bloodletting, miscarriages, and full-frontal nudity.<br />\nThink of it as the Costume Drama<br />\nfor the Nineties.<br />\nDirector Frears, whose<br />\nprevious credits have been limited<br />\nto the British independent cult hits<br />\nMy Beautiful Laundrette and<br />\nSammy and Rosie Get Laid (films<br />\nyour parents probably didn't<br />\nlike), has found himself helming<br />\na mammoth $14 million AngloAmerican production that boasts<br />\na trio of distinctively American<br />\nstars: Glenn Close, John<br />\nMalkovich, and Michelle<br />\nPfeiffer.<br />\nThe incongruity of these three<br />\ndecked out in magnificently baroque, late 18th-century French<br />\nfinery and acting like preRevolutionary aristocrats was apparently not lost on the director,<br /><br />\nand thus he revels in the frills and<br />\nthe foppery. He rubs your face in<br />\nit, makes a performance out of<br />\nthe intricate rituals of fashion and<br />\nmanners and the studied deception of appearance. The<br />\nfascinating opening sequence of<br />\nthe film show Close and<br />\nMalkovich being primped and<br />\npowdered and garroted into their<br />\nelaborate garb by a hushed army<br />\nof servants, like performers<br />\nbefore a show or knights before<br />\ncombat. The costume becomes<br />\ndrama, and the characters are<br />\nboth performers in their own personal operas and combatants vying for control.<br />\nThe drama itself revolves<br />\naround the competitive intrigues<br />\nof Close's Marquise de Merteuil<br />\nand Malkovich's Vicomte de Valmont, two French aristocrats with<br />\na taste for seduction and a lot of<br />\ntime on their hands. Romance is<br />\nan intricate game of manipulation<br />\nand deceit, and they are both experienced players. Valmont's<br />\nquarry is one Madame de Tourval (Michelle Pfeiffer), a pillar of<br />\nChristian virtue and decency with<br />\na distant husband. Valmont sees<br />\nin her the ultimate challenge to<br />\nhis skills and makes a wager on<br />\nhis eventual succcess with<br />\nMerteuil, who is meanwhile raising hell in other quarters of the<br />\ncourt with her own schemes.<br />\nThings get very convoluted, and<br />\neventually everyone dies or goes<br />\ninsane or otherwise pays the<br />\nwages of sin.<br />\nLiaisons is being heaped with<br />\nAcademy Award nominations,<br />\nand it seems to have touched a<br />\nnerve in the fickle American<br />\npublic in much the same way that<br />\nlast year's Fatal Attraction did.<br />\nThe comparison is inevitable and<br /><br />\nnot entirely undeserved, given the<br />\npresence of Glenn Close in a<br />\nsuperficially-similar role. \"I was<br />\nborn to dominate your sex and<br />\navenge my own,\" she intones at<br />\none point in the film, calling up<br />\nechoes of Attraction's vengeful<br />\nwoman-as-vindicator persona.<br />\nBut Close's Marquise is a cool<br />\nmanipulator, not a knife-wielding<br />\npsychotic, and though her obsessions prove equally tragic, it is<br />\nsomehow a more restrained, cunning performance. Caked in her<br />\npale death-white makeup and<br />\ntrussed into her hoop-skirt battle<br />\narmor, she is a picture of<br />\nbloodless, relentless cruelty\u2014<br />\nantisexual where Fatal Attraction<br />\nwas violently sexual.<br />\nJohn Malkovich's Vicomte de<br />\nValmont has a certain fascination<br />\nall its own, if only for the often<br />\nclumsy spectacle of hearing the<br />\nconsummate American actor<br />\nwrap his Midwestern drawl<br />\naround David Hampton's precise,<br />\nesoteric dialogue. It takes some<br />\ngetting used to, but his serpentine<br />\ngrace and understated approach<br />\nmake him a commanding and<br />\nbelievable screen figure nevertheless. Michelle Pfeiffer looks<br />\nappropriately pale and winsome<br />\nin the less demanding role of<br />\nMadame de Tourval, but she has<br />\nnone of the depth of the other<br />\ntwo. Her performance is largely<br />\ncold blue eyes and the occasional<br />\nwracked sob and heaving breast.<br />\nThe script, written by Hampton from his own stage play, is<br />\non Les Liaisons<br />\nbased<br />\nDangereuses, a scandalous 18thcentury novel by Choderlos de<br />\nLaclos that was banned after the<br />\nRevolution for its hearty depictions of aristocratic tomfoolery.<br />\nHampton's screenplay is literate<br /><br />\nthose of stereotypical Poles,<br />\nJews, and immigrants, all of<br />\nwhom have nothing better to do<br />\nthan scrap for money and, when<br />\nthey fail, blame someone else.<br />\nKatz's portrayal is right on the<br />\nmark, though<br />\nMushnik's<br />\ncharacter is too one-dimensional<br />\nfor Katz to develop it better. His<br />\nbest scenes, too, are with<br />\nSeymour.<br />\nAs Audrey, Kennedy overplays<br />\nher role, but the role deserves to<br />\nbe overplayed. Kennedy's speaking and singing voices are sufficiently wispy, and the seemingly<br />\nuncharacteristic power her voice<br />\ntakes on in \"Suddenly Seymour\"<br />\naccurately reflects Audrey's<br />\ndiscovery of an \"ideal\" in<br />\nSeymour, an ideal Audrey never<br />\nknew.<br />\nKennedy is at her best in the<br />\nsolo \"Somewhere That's<br />\nGreen,\" in which Audrey longs<br />\nto escape Skid Row for the grassy<br />\nelegance of the suburbs. To say<br />\nmore would ruin the funniest line<br />\nin the song.<br />\nGolub plays the sadistic dentist<br />\nnicely. His voice and intonation<br />\nclearly reflect Orin's excesses,<br />\nand his facial expressions<br />\nhighlight the wretched excess the<br />\ndentist preaches and practices.<br />\nLike Mushnik, Orin is a onedimensional character, but Golub<br />\nlargely overcomes this handicap.<br />\nAs the voice of Aldrey II, An-<br /><br />\ndy Angelino does a good imitation of the Motown shriek the<br />\nscript demands. The accent is difficult to master, but Angelino<br />\ndoes well except in the higher<br />\nranges.<br />\nSince Little Shop is in part a<br />\nspoof of 1950s culture as well as<br />\nof B-movies and science fiction,<br />\nit has an obligatory female trio of<br />\nsingers, the Plantlettes, who wear<br />\ndated dresses and hairdos.<br />\nThe Plantlettes\u2014Marci Anderson, Mary Kita, and Kara<br />\nStein\u2014have no business in Skid<br />\nRow other than to inject their<br />\nthree-part harmonies into spots<br />\nwhen no one else is speaking, or<br />\nto offer shallow, unwanted advice<br />\nto Seymour. They are just, well,<br />\nalways there.<br />\nThat's a good thing. Anderson,<br />\nKita, and Stein are good singers,<br />\nand funny because they always<br />\nturn up just when other characters<br />\ndon't need them.<br />\nBy and large, the show is a success. It's shortcomings result<br />\nlargely from weaknesses in the<br />\nscript, not in the acting.

All alpha chains have<br />\nsome common amino acid sequences, but may differ in others.<br />\nEach chain also contains, at its<br />\ncore, an iron atom that binds oxygen at the oxygen-rich lungs,<br />\nand releases it at oxygen-deficient<br />\ntissues.<br />\nIn 1959, Max Perutz at Cambridge saw that alpha and beta<br />\nchains from horses and those<br />\nfrom sperm whales had the same<br />\namino acid sequence. Perutz<br />\ntheorized that hemoglobin from<br />\nhorses and those from sperm<br />\nwhales developed from a com-<br /><br />\nmon genetic precursor. Perutz's<br />\nteam and others analyzed<br />\nhemoglobin from more animals<br />\nand found common amino acid<br />\nsequences. For example, in all<br />\nanimals, every hemoglobin chain<br />\nhas a histidine amino acid at the<br />\neighty-seventh position.<br />\nAll alpha chains have identical<br />\namino acids at 23 of their 141<br />\npositions, while beta chains have<br />\nthe same amino acids in 20 out of<br />\n146 positions. If only mammalian<br />\nsequences are analyzed, then<br />\nidentical amino acids can be<br />\nfound at 50 out of 141 positions<br />\nin alpha chains, and Si out of 146<br />\npositions in beta chains. Alpha<br />\nchains of man and rhesus<br />\nmonkeys differ by only 4 positions out of 141, cows and man<br />\ndiffer by 17, while sharks and<br />\nman differ by 99 amino acids.<br />\nSimilar data supports Perutz's<br />\ngeneral principle of evolution,<br />\nwhich states that the more closely related two species are, the<br />\nmore similar the amino acid sequences of their proteins will be.<br />\nIn all animals, hemoglobin performs the same function: it acts<br />\nas an oxygen carrier. Certain<br />\namino acids are 'conserved' during evolution, because they are<br />\nnecessary for the function and<br />\nstructure of hemoglobin. These<br />\namino acids cannot be replaced<br />\nby other amino acids, because<br />\nany change will impair the<br />\nhemoglobin's function. Individuals missing these amino<br />\nacids because of mutation will die<br /><br />\nbefore they reproduce. For example, the iron atom, vital for oxygen transport, is held in place by<br />\nbinding to the histidine at the<br />\neighty-seventh position of both<br />\nalpha and beta chains. If histidine<br />\nwere to be replaced by any other<br />\namino acid, the iron atom would<br />\nnot be held firmly in place. Any<br />\nchange in the iron's position<br />\nmakes oxygen less accessible.<br />\nScientists use Perutz's general<br />\nprinciple of evolution to analyze<br />\nthe number of differences between hemoglobin chains from<br />\ndifferent species. Researchers<br />\nnow believe that birds evolved<br />\nfrom primitive reptiles, that<br />\nwhales are more evolved<br />\ncreatures than platypuses, that<br />\ncarp are closer in the evolutionary<br />\ntree to man than sharks, and so<br />\non. Some plants, like soybeans,<br />\nhave hemoglobin; their alpha<br />\nchains differ from that of humans<br />\nby 113 out of 141 amino acids.<br />\nHence, from comparative<br />\nhemoglobin studies, we know that<br />\nplants and humans, though<br />\nseparated from each other on the<br />\nevolutionary tree, have a common ancestor.<br />\nScientists are attempting to take<br />\nthis order a step further by looking at the source of the amino<br />\nacids. Amino acids are encoded<br />\nby specific genes that are passed<br />\nfrom parent to offspring.<br />\nGeneticists study the genes that<br />\nencode for the alpha and beta<br />\nchains. Studies have shown many<br />\nsimilarities in these genes,<br /><br />\nespecially those that encode for<br />\nvital amino acids. Many highly<br />\nconserved sequences are present<br />\nalong with a number of moderately conserved sequences. Gene<br />\nstudies are useful because scientists can find varying degrees of<br />\nconservation of genes and from<br />\nthis draw more accurate conclusions about evolution of subspecies and other lower orders.<br />\nFrom gene studies, scientists<br />\ncan also establish a time scale for<br />\nthe evolutionary tree because<br />\nchanges that lead to evolution occur at the level of the gene. Mutations change genes and are<br />\nresponsible for the variation<br />\namong species. Scientists make a<br />\ntime frame for each mutation by<br />\ncomparing hemoglobin chains of<br />\nclosely related species. If two<br />\nclosely related species differ by<br />\n10 mutations, and if fossil records<br />\nshow that the two species are ten<br />\nmillion years apart, then each<br />\nmutation must take on the average<br />\na million years.<br />\nBy making a time frame for<br />\neach mutation, scientists have<br />\ncome up with a biological clock<br />\nto accompany the evolutionary<br />\ntree. The unique feature of the<br />\nclock is its varying speed;<br />\nsometimes, the rate of mutation<br />\nis high, but at other times, it is<br />\nalmost negligible. The clock<br />\nallows for natural selection. For<br />\nexample, if a mutation in one<br />\ngene is selected for by nature,<br />\nthen it may trigger mutations in<br />\nother genes, thus speeding up the<br /><br />\nclock. Similarly, if a mutation is<br />\nrejected by nature, then other<br />\nmutations may also be blocked,<br />\nslowing down the clock.<br />\nGeneticists using the biological<br />\nclock estimate that plants and<br />\nanimals separated 500 million<br />\nyears ago, that reptiles evolved<br />\n300 million years ago, that<br />\nprimitive mammals evolved 100<br />\nmillion years ago, that monkeys<br />\nevolved less than 30 million years<br />\nago, and that man evolved from<br />\nmonkeys less than 15 million<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nHowever, the evolutionary tree<br />\nis still incomplete and the order<br />\nof evolution of some species is<br />\nunclear. Federal funding for mapping hemoglobin genes is<br />\nseventy-five million dollars for<br />\n1989. By studying the past patterns of evolution, scientists hope<br />\nto predict the future.<br /><br />\nSir James W.

The Jays won a 6-5<br />\nthriller against the Naval<br />\nAcademy at Annapolis on Saturday, as left winger Tom Rocco<br /><br />\nled the Hopkins scoring spree<br />\nwith a hat trick. The first two<br />\ngoals came off of rebounds as a<br />\nresult of shots from the point by<br />\nMarc Koren and Dave Boxenbaum. Rocco's third tally was set<br />\nup by a fine pass from Bill Maralso<br />\nHopkins<br />\nquardt.<br />\ndemonstrated improved positioning in front of the opponent's net<br />\nas Eric Teitel, Jay Calkins, and<br />\nPat Gibbons each scored goals off<br />\nof rebounds. Goalie Dave<br />\nBowyer also had an impressive<br />\nouting as he stopped over thirty<br />\nshots, many of them at pointblank range.<br />\nThis victory against Navy<br />\nmarked the first time that the Jays<br />\nhave defeated the Midshipmen in<br />\nover four years.

In five years as head coach, Zimmerman has<br />\nguided the Blue Jays to three titles.<br />\nThree returning All-Americans, including the nation's top defenseman and top goalkeeper, lead a very<br />\ntalented Hopkins team on the drive to the National<br />\nChampionship. The road will be filled with obstacles,<br />\nmost notably tomorrow's opponent, top-ranked and<br />\ndefending champion Syracuse University. Although<br />\nthe Orangemen are the favorites to defeat Hopkins,<br />\nand ultimately to repeat as champs, Coach Zimmerman is confident of his team's ability.<br />\nATTACK<br />\n\"We have a more powerful offense this year,\"<br />\nsays Coach Zimmerman.<br />\nSophomore Mike Panetta (in 1988, 10 goals, 4<br />\nassists) heads an attack which must compensate for<br />\nthe loss to graduation of first-team All-America Mike<br />\nMorrill.

Last year, as a sophomore, Kessenich<br />\nwon first-team All-American honors and the C.<br />\nMarkland Kelly Award as the nation's outstanding<br />\ngoalkeeper in Division I lacrosse. Over the past two<br />\nyears, the Jays have won 16 of the 18 games that<br />\nKessenich has started.<br />\n\"Quint looks as good now as he ever has. He has<br />\ndone a tremendous job of preparing physically and<br />\nmentally for the Syracuse game and for the season,\"<br />\nsays Zimmerman.<br />\nScott Giardina (Farmingdale, NY)and Ian Hobbs<br />\n(New Canaan, CT)are promising freshmen who will<br />\nback up Kessenich.<br /><br />\nCoach Don Zimmerman is exicted about the 1989<br />\nseason.<br />\n\"This year we have more depth on the squad,\"<br />\nsaid Zimmerman. \"We're going at a good pace. We<br />\nwill be ready for Syracuse, March 4th.\"<br />\nTomorrow, Zimmerman and the Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nteam face an unenviable task. The Jays open the 1989<br />\nseason by playing a Syracuse team that appears even<br />\nbetter than the 1988 Orangemen.<br />\nLast year, in the season opener for both teams,<br />\nSyracuse trounced the Blue Jays at Homewood, 19-7.<br />\nThe loss was the most one-sided in Zimmerman's<br />\nfive years as head coach. The Orangemen then sailed on to a perfect 15-0 record and the National<br />\nChampionship.<br />\nSyracuse's greatest weapon is the Gait twins. The<br />\njunior midfielders were both named first-team AllAmerica last season. Gary, consensus Player of the<br />\nYear, scored a record-breaking 70 goals; Paul netted 47.<br />\n\"The impact they made last year on lacrosse was<br />\nas significant as any since Jim Brown,\" said Coach<br />\nZimmerman. Syracuse alumnus Jim Brown, more<br />\nfamous for his achievements on the football field,<br />\nis widely considered the greatest lacrosse player ever.<br />\n\"The Gaits are excellent players, they're dominant. They have to be held in check,\" said Zimmerman. \"It'll be tough for them to put together backto-back seasons like that.\"<br />\nWith the Gaits, Attackman of the Year John<br />\nZulberti, goalie Matt Palumb (the most valuable<br />\nplayer of the 1988 championship game), and four<br />\nother returning starters, the Orangemen are not only predicted to repeat as champions, they are expected<br />\nto. The team is generally considered unbeatable. But<br />\nZimmerman believes there is a team that can defeat<br />\nSyracuse.<br />\n\"We are aiming to win, and we can win.\" said<br />\nZimmerman. He explained that Hopkins must control the tempo, not allowing the Orangemen to play<br />\ntheir fast-paced, running game, and must also hustle for groundballs.<br />\nIn regard to last season's game, Zimmerman issued<br />\nthe following statement: \"Losing to Syracuse was<br />\nembarrassing enough, having people throw oranges<br />\nwas humiliating. I expect the fans to show class and<br />\nrespect for our opponents and our team.\"<br />\nIn 1988, the Blue Jays did not reach the national<br />\nsemifinals for the first time since 1975. The Hopkins<br />\nseason ended at Homewood in the quarterfinals, as<br />\nVirginia upset the second-ranked Jays 11-10 in<br />\novertime.<br />\nFor Hopkins, the game was the second consecutive<br />\novertime struggle. In the regular season finale, at<br />\nHomewood, the Jays needed an extra period to defeat<br />\nTowson State, 9-8.<br />\n\"We were not a team rolling into the playoffs,\"<br />\nexplained Zimmerman.\"We peaked at the Maryland<br />\nSee HOPKINS, 17<br /><br />\n4/MARCH 3, 1989<br />\n************************************************************<br />\n******<br /><br />\n*******************************<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nScott Gardinia<br />\nGoal<br />\nFreshman<br />\n6'0\" 175 lbs<br />\n* Farmingdale, NY<br />\nFarmingdale H.S.<br /><br />\nJim Harkin<br />\n* 10Midfield<br />\nSophomore<br />\n* 510\" 165 lbs<br />\n* Setauket, NY<br />\n* Avon-Old-Farms H.S.<br /><br />\nJohn Dressel<br />\nMidfield<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'1\" 180 lbs<br />\nBaltimore, MD<br />\nLawrenceville H.S.<br /><br />\nIan Hobbs<br />\nGoal<br />\nFreshman<br />\n5'8\" 155 lbs<br />\nNew Canaan, CT<br />\nNew Canaan H.S.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nQuint Kessenich<br />\nGoal<br />\nJunior<br />\n5'8\" 165 lbs<br />\nLynbrook, NY<br />\nLynbrook H.S.<br /><br />\nJay Wright<br />\nMidfield<br />\nSophomore<br />\n5'8\" 150 lbs<br />\nLittleton, CO<br />\nKent Denver H.S.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nJohn Ciccarone<br />\nAttack<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'0\" 160 lbs<br />\nBaltimore, MD<br />\nBoys' Latin H.S.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nsmedthfiTliderney<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nSophomore<br />\n5'9\" 155 lbs<br />\nWantagh, NY<br />\nMacArthur H.S.<br /><br />\nIThe 1989<br />\n18<br /><br />\nRobbi Robertson<br />\nFreshmanMidfield<br /><br />\n* 6'1\" 185 lbs<br />\n* Pepper Pike, OH<br />\n* Western Reserve Academy<br /><br />\nJay Clarke<br />\nAttack<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'3\" 175 lbs<br />\nLutherville, MD<br />\nDulaney H.S.<br /><br />\n19<br /><br />\nPhotos by<br />\n***************************<br /><br />\nwis<br />\nr<br /><br />\nMatt Panetta<br />\nAttack<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'2\" 190 lbs<br />\nElmont, NY<br />\nElmont H.S.<br /><br />\n22<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nAMikecMorrissey<br /><br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'0\" 180 lbs<br />\nMassapequa, NY<br />\nMassapequa H.S.<br /><br />\nScott Marr<br />\nAttack<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'0\" 180 lbs<br />\nYorktown Heights, NY<br />\nYorktown H.S.<br /><br />\n24<br /><br />\nq1<br />\n- ,114<br /><br />\nm<br />\nKeditfheG<br />\nldertsen<br />\n0 Freshman<br />\n5'11\" 175 lbs<br />\nGlen Arm, MD<br />\nBoys' Latin H.S.<br /><br />\nBrendan Kelly<br />\nGreg Kelly<br />\nRoss Henshaw<br />\nBrian Lukacz<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nAttack<br />\nMidfield<br />\nSenior<br />\nJunior<br />\nSophomore<br />\nFreshman<br />\n* 5'9\" 170 lbs<br />\n6'1\" 180 lbs<br />\n511\" 170 lbs<br />\n6'2\" 185 lbs<br />\n* Towson, MD<br />\nNorthport, NY<br />\nWaccabuc, NY<br />\nActon, MA<br />\n* Towson H.S.<br />\nSt.<br />\nAnthony H.S.<br />\nSt. Mark's H.S.<br />\nHotchkiss H.S.<br />\n* ******************************************************<br />\n*****************************************<br /><br />\n* 32<br /><br />\n33<br /><br />\n35<br /><br />\n36<br /><br />\nLACROSSE '89/5<br />\n*************<br />\n************<br />\n************<br />\n************<br />\n************<br />\n************<br />\n************************<br /><br />\nMark Dressel<br />\nMidfield<br />\nJunior<br />\n5'9\" 160 lbs<br />\nBaltimore, MD<br />\nBoys' Latin H.S.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n1A<br /><br />\ndfRziedmpoluch<br />\ne<br />\nMidfield<br />\n41.

For<br />\nthose of you who are regular readers of the NewsLetter, the following article is the lacrosse version<br />\nof Pat's Picks. Here is how I see the season shaping up for the Jays.<br /><br />\nSYRACUSE<br />\nSaturday, March 4<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 10-5<br />\nThis seems like a fairly easy pick. After all,this<br />\nis pretty much the same Syracuse that came to into<br />\nHomewood last year and rocked the Jays 19-7 en<br />\nroute to an undefeated national championship. The<br />\nOrangemen are loaded, to say the least. The midfield is paced by the most prolific tandem to hit<br />\nlacrosse in quite some time, the Gait brothers. The<br />\nattack unit from last year returns intact, led by first<br />\nteam All-American John Zulberti (22 goals, 47<br />\nassists) and honorable mention All-American Greg<br />\nBurns. A defensive unit which failed to relinquish<br />\nmore than ten goals in any game last season also<br />\nreturns all of its starters, including goalie Matt<br />\nPalumb (17-1 as a starter). With a lineup like this,<br />\nhow can the Orangemen fail to defeat Hopkins for<br />\nthe fourth straight time?<br />\nYet I think that the Jays can pull off the upset. First<br />\nof all, Syracuse can't be happy with being booted<br />\nfrom the Carrier Dome for the sake of a nationally<br />\ntelevised basketball game. Secondly, the Orange have<br />\nnever faced Quint Kessenich, and he just might make<br />\nthe difference in this year's game. Thirdly, Hopkins<br />\nhas revenge on their minds, and I don't believe they<br />\nwill be embarrassed at home for two consecutive<br />\nyears.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 12, Syracuse 11<br /><br />\nWASHINGTON COLLEGE<br />\nSaturday, March 11<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 28-1<br />\nThe Division III Shoremen gave Hopkins all they<br />\ncould handle last year in Chestertown, losing only<br />\n12-8. They finished the regular season with a sevengame winning streak before losing in the Division<br />\nIII quarterfinals to wind up 12-5. Three of their five<br />\nlosses came at the hands of nationally-ranked Division I foes.<br />\nThe Shoremen return eleven seniors and five Division III All-Americas from last year's team. They<br />\nare led on offense by attackman Tim Hormes, who<br />\nscored 49 goals and had 20 assists last season. Defensively, Division III Defenseman of the Year Matt<br />\nWilson is back, but he is hardly enough to stop the<br />\nHopkins attack.<br />\nThe Shoremen may be one of Division III's better teams, but they are no match for the Jays,<br />\nespecially here at HomeNk ood.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 17, Washington College 7<br /><br />\nRUTGERS<br />\nSaturday, March 18<br />\nPiscataway, NJ<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 22-3<br />\nThis may be a big year for the Scarlet Knights,<br />\nas they return 37 players from their 1988 squad which<br />\nwent 8-5 and finished the season ranked fifteenth na-<br /><br />\ntionally. They've played tough against Hopkins in<br />\nthe last two years, losing 12-9 here at Homewood<br />\nlast season and 10-7 in New Jersey in 1987.<br />\nRutgers is stacked on offense, paced by attackman<br />\nAndy DeCicco (21 goals) and midfielder Greg<br />\nRinaldi, who earned third team All-America honors<br />\nlast year by scoring 30 goals. Rinaldi is joined by<br />\nsixteen other returning lettermen at midfield.<br />\nBut the Scarlet Knights will be weak on defense,<br />\nand they lost their goalie, Jim Gilman, to graduation. They may stay with Hopkins for a few periods,<br />\nbut defense will be the key to this one.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 13, Rutgers 7<br /><br />\nNORTH CAROLINA<br />\nSaturday, April 8<br />\nChapel Hill, NC<br />\n3:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 8-6<br /><br />\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and predict a<br />\none-goal game. Actually, it's fairly easy to predict<br />\nthat this game will be decided in the final seconds<br />\nor even in overtime, because seven of the last eight<br />\nmeetings between these two rivals have been decided by one goal. Last year, goalies Barney Aburn and<br />\nQuint Kessenich squared off in a defensive battle here<br />\nat Homewood as Hopkins edged the Tar Heels 6-5.<br />\nBut Carolina was hurt badly by graduation, losSaturday, March 25<br />\ning Aburn, who led the nation with a .709 save<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\npercentage last year, and four other All-Americas.<br />\nGone are first-team defenseman Boyd Harden, sec2:00 p.m.<br />\nond-team midfielder Tim Welsh, third-team midHopkins leads the series 43-12 fielder Kevin Haus, and honorable mention midfielder Ted Brown.<br />\nThe Tigers, under former Hopkins assistant Bill<br />\nBut despite all of these losses, the Tar Heels will<br />\nTierney, are trying to build a program capable of be strong once again, and having the game in Chapel<br />\ncompeting in the Ivy League.

The victory was the Cavaliers' second<br />\nstraight at Homewood, as they also upset the Jays<br />\n9-7 in '87.<br />\nHowever, goalie Peter Sheehan, who was simply<br />\namazing in last year's quarterfinal matchup, will not<br />\nbe back to torment the Jays, as he has been lost to<br />\ngraduation. Although the Wahoos are a very talented<br />\nteam capable of making their second straight trip to<br />\nthe Final Four, I don't think they will beat Hopkins<br />\nwithout Sheehan.<br />\nFirst team All-America midfielder Andy Kraus will<br />\nkeep this one close, but look for the Jays to prevail<br />\nin the end.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 9, Virginia 8<br /><br />\nSaturday, April 15<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 44-13<br />\nArmy was also hurt by graduation, losing their<br />\nleading scorer Bob Betchley (second team AllAmerica)and goalie Joe Portuese. The Cadets usually<br />\nplay a very physical, low-scoring game against<br />\nHopkins, and this year will be no different. But<br />\nwithout Betchley, Army won't stay as close as they<br />\nhave in the last two years, and the Jays will be hungry<br />\nafter the loss at Carolina.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 11, Army 6<br />\nSee SCHEDULE, 7<br /><br />\nGood luck,<br />\nJays!<br /><br />\nLACROSSE '89/7<br /><br />\nSyracuse tomorrow in battle for number one<br />\nSCHEDULE, from 6<br /><br />\nMARYLAND<br />\nSaturday, April 22<br />\nCollege Park, MD<br />\n1:00 p.m.<br />\nHopkins leads the series 46-30-1<br /><br />\nfalling to Syracuse in the NCAA quarterfinals.

Brenner and Gopal Kowdley<br />\nWith Eddie Murray transplanted to La-La Land,<br />\nand the remaining Orioles resembling a club from the<br />\nInternational League, Baltimore's top spring sports<br />\ndraw remains the Blue Jays of Johns Hopkins University. Although last year ended in disappointing<br />\nfashion at the hands of Peter Sheehan and the Wahoos<br />\nof Virginia, the Blue Jays still managed to win nine<br />\nconsecutive games against many of the best collegiate<br />\nlacrosse teams in the nation.<br />\nBy now,even the freshmen realize that for the 1989<br />\nJays to be victorious on Memorial Day in College<br />\nPark, they must fare better against the Syracuse<br />\nOrangemen, who last year invaded Homewood and<br />\ntrounced Hopkins 19-7. The Orange steamrolled<br />\nthrough their remaining regular season encounters,<br />\nas well as the NCAA tournament, en route to the<br />\nNational Championshop. However, as any Orioles<br />\nfan will tell you, this is indeed a new season, and<br />\nthat means three months of lacrosse festivities to<br />\ntempt even the regulars of D-level. To try and provide you with insight into the Blue Jays competition,<br />\nhere is our second annual Pre-season lacrosse poll<br />\naccompanied by our expert analyses<br />\n1) Syracuse Orangemen:<br />\nLed by juniors Gary and Paul Gait, the Orange<br />\nreturn all but two of their starters from last year's<br />\nundefeated squad. Coach Roy Simmons Jr. will rely heavily on the explosive Gaits, who at times seem<br />\nto elevate the game to new levels. Gary Gait's<br />\nstatistics from last year catapulted him into a level<br />\noccupied by the greatest players ever, including<br />\nformer Syracuse standout Jim Brown. Gait also added<br />\npersonal innovation to the world of lacrosse with his<br />\nnow famous \"Air Gait\" maneuver, which he introduced during last year's Final Four.<br />\nBesides the Gaits, Syracuse will count heavily on<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022M=M\u2022lk._<br /><br />\na very experienced attack, including returning starters<br />\nGreg Burns, Jim Egan, and the colorful John \"Z\"<br />\nZulberti. With an experienced second unit, as well<br />\nas an offensively-minded midfield, goal scoring<br />\nshould continue in great numbers for Syracuse.<br />\nAt midfield, the Orange lost speedster Keith Owens,<br />\nstarter Brad Roos, as well as face-off specialist and<br />\nco-captain Bill Dirrigl. However, Rodney Dumpson,<br />\nEarl Hall, and junior-World player Freddie Amaya<br />\nare ready to establish themselves on the collegiate<br />\nlevel. Also, Joe Bonnaci, a two year starter at Navy,<br />\nhas transferred to Syracuse.<br />\nWith all of the blowouts and high scoring antics<br />\nprovided by the Orange last year, many people<br />\noverlooked their exceptional defense. The close<br />\ndefense of Mark Stopher, Jim McNamara, and Pat<br />\nMcCabe returns to the Dome. A strong recruiting<br />\nclass will provide insurance at the long stick position.<br />\nReturning in the net will be junior Matt Palumb,<br />\nwho brings a 17-1 career record into 1989. Jerry<br />\nDeLorenzo was one of last year's most highly regarded high school players; he also participated in the<br />\njunior World games. He might well be the top backup goalie in the nation.<br />\nOf note is the fact that during last season, Syracuse<br />\nplayed all of their games on artificial turf. Playing<br />\non turf allowed Syracuse to play a faster and more<br />\nexplosive game than would have been possible on<br />\ngrass, especially in foul conditions. This season,<br />\nhowever, they have six of their first eight games on<br />\nthe road, with all but one played on natural grass.<br />\nTheir opener at Homewood was the sole exception.<br />\n2) Johns Hopkins Blue Jays:<br />\nLed by returning first team All-Americans Dave<br />\nPietramala and Quint Kessenich, the one hundred<br />\nseventh edition of the Jays will look to capture their<br />\n43rd National Championship. Coach Don Zimmerman leads a squad with eleven returning seniors.<br /><br />\nThe attack will be led by sophomore stimuout Matt<br />\nPanetta, who showed last year (as well as in the fall)<br />\nthat he was ready to shoulder much of the scoring<br />\nload. He will be joined by seniors Jeff Ihm and John<br />\nCiccarone. Juniors Jay Clarke and Scott Marr will<br />\nalso see much playing time. Sophomore Mike Morrissey and freshmen Drew Burns and Jeff Wills will<br />\nprovide support as well.<br />\nThe midfield postition is well stocked, led by returning starters Brendan Kelly, John Dressel, and John<br />\nWilkins. Other seniors with Championship experience include Pat Russell and face-off artist Joe<br />\nRzempoluch. Junior Greg Kelly and sophomore Seth<br />\nTierney will also see a lot of work. A number of promising underclassmen will also compete at this position, especially freshman Brian Lukacz, who is<br />\nscheduled to start today against Syracuse.<br />\nThe defense, perhaps the strongest unit, returns<br />\nstarters Pietramala, Greg Lilly, and Steve Ciccarone.<br />\nSure to see a lot of action are senior Chip Dates and<br />\nsophomores Billy Dawn and Brian Voelker. Due to<br />\nknee injuries, both James DeTommaso and Dave<br />\nHowland will be sidelined for the entire '89 campaign, but they will both return for the 1990 season.<br />\nIn goal resides junior Kessenich, who many consider the team's most valuable player. He will try<br />\nto duplicate his first team All-American selection in<br />\nhis final two years of competition. He will be backed up by two promising freshmen, Scott Giardina<br />\nand Ian Hobbs.<br />\nWith their experienced and talented defensive<br />\ncorps, Hopkins will likely provide Syracuse with its<br />\nmost formidable competition on the road to Memorial<br />\nDay at College Park.<br />\n3) North Carolina Tar Heels:<br />\nCoach Willie Scroggs has thirty-three letterman<br />\nreturning to Chapel Hill to face the toughest<br />\nSee TOP FIFTEEN, 8<br /><br />\n8/MARCH 3, 1989<br /><br />\nFive other Hopkins opponents andfive Ivy League<br />\nTOP FIFTEEN, from 7<br />\nschedule of his eleven-year tenure. The attack will<br />\nbe led by returning starters Neil Redfern, John<br />\nSzczpinski, and Corey Gavitt. Other experienced<br />\nscorers are Mark Tummillo and Chris<br />\nGalgano. The midfield position suffered greatly at<br />\ngraduation with the loss of three All-Americans.<br />\nHowever, eleven returnees will provide Scroggs with<br />\na competitive middie corps who will be asked to fill<br />\nthis large vacancy. Returning seniors include John<br />\nLowe and Craig O'Callaghan.<br />\nOn defense, the lone returning starter is Paul Fitzpatrick. Other long sticks returning to Chapel Hill<br />\ninclude seniors Scott Price, Carlo Grohovac, and<br />\nGreg Vamos. With a number of talented<br />\nunderclassmen, this unit remains well stocked.<br />\nGoalie Barney Aburn, from Towson, had departed.<br />\nAburn set an ACC record and led the entire nation<br />\nin save percentage last year with a whopping .709.<br />\nAmong candidates to fill this large loss are Lars<br />\nPedersen and Pat Olmert.<br />\nThe Tar Heels are favored to defend last year's<br />\nACC Championship and earn a tenth consecutive<br />\nNCAA bid.<br />\n4) Virginia Cavaliers:<br />\nThis year, the Wahoos will look to improve on last<br />\nyear's successes. After a down year in 1987, UVa<br />\nrebounded with a fine season that saw them reach the<br />\nsemi-finals in the NCAA tournament.<br />\nCoach Jim \"Ace\" Adams (with over 250 career<br />\nwins) will field an attack corps led by Rob Schmalz,<br />\nTom Burt, and Jim Webster. Together with promising underclassmen, they will look to duplicate the<br />\nexploits gf Greg Sessa, Doug Amacher, and Chase<br />\nMonroe, all of whom left Charlottesville in 1988.<br />\nReturning middies will by led by Andy Kraus, a<br />\nfirst-team All-American, as well as Eric and David<br />\nPurdy, Steve Anderson, Tim Oursler, and the experienced Mike and David Smith. This unit comprises the strength of Virginia heading into 1989.<br /><br />\nThe defense is led by returning seniors John Chadwick, Charles White, Mike Dekshenieks, and Doug<br />\nCorrigan. With the aid of five returning juniors, it<br />\nappears that the Cavaliers will have little trouble<br />\nreplacing last year's starters Pete McSherry and Second-team All-American Rob Schupler.<br />\nLast year saw the departure of goalie Peter<br />\nSheehan; this, however, was not early enough for<br />\nHopkins. During last year's quarterfinals here at<br />\nHomewood, Sheehan put on a clinic as the Wahoos<br />\ndowned the Blue Jays in overtime, knocking Hopkins<br />\nout of the Final Four for the first time in years.<br />\nReplacing him this season will likely be Tom<br />\nGroenenger, a second-year player.<br />\n5) Maryland Terrapins:<br />\nAlthough last year's Maryland squad was indeed<br />\na major disappointment, many in College Park expect this season's edition to return to the competitive<br />\nlevel that marked the program just two years ago.<br />\nCoach Dick Edell has an experienced but young team<br />\nthat might very well surprise a few folks and make<br />\na run for the title in front of their own fans.<br />\nSuper-feeder Brendan Hanley has graduated, but<br />\nthe attack corps is still strong, led by sophomore stan-<br /><br />\nliatuqda<br />\nWiqe<br />\naqd<br />\nSpirits<br /><br />\nWIT<br />\nAlWHIE HOT<br />\nir<br /><br />\n- /\u2022<br />\nl'fhAt<br /><br />\nk<br />\n,<br />\n'<br />\n41<br /><br />\nRotunda Mall<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nCAL DOMINOS ME<br />\nINEP011\u2022<br /><br />\nADD ONE FRE<br />\nAdd one free topping of<br />\nyour choice with the<br />\npurchase of any pizza.<br />\nOne coupon per pizza.<br />\nOw drivers cony less Ihen<br />\nUmiasd delivery area_<br /><br />\nCall us!<br />\n338-2<br />\n500<br />\n2722 Remington Avenue<br /><br />\ndout Rob Wurzburger, last season's leading scorer.<br />\nAlso starting up front will be sophomore Mark<br />\nDouglas and junior Steve Young.<br />\nThe middies will greatly miss Tom Worstell, who,<br />\nbehind the Gaits, was probably the most complete<br />\nmidfielder in the nation last season. Returning for<br />\nhis final season at College Park is co-captain Phil<br />\nWilliard. He will be joined by his younger brother<br />\nDave, as well as junior Chris Connor.<br />\nDefense is led by co-captains Scott Wheeler and<br />\nfellow senior Jeff McNeil. Junior Bill Ralph will<br />\nround out the starting close defense. Two notable longstick departures are Doug Poindexter and third-team<br />\nAll-American Dan Coughlan.<br />\nIn goal for the Terps will be sophomore Mike<br />\nMcCanna from Catonsville. He takes over for Dennis Sullivan, who had difficulty replacing the sensational Jim Beardmore.<br />\n6) Navy Midshipmen:<br />\nCoach Bryan Matthews led the Middies to the<br />\nNCAA's last year, where they lost to eventual champ<br />\nion Syracuse in the quarterfinals. However, there<br />\nwas much cause for cheer in Annapolis with wins<br />\nover perennial powers Army, Virginia, and<br />\nMaryland. In 1989, Navy will rely on a very talented<br />\nand veteran scoring threat to shadow their lack of<br />\ndefensive experience.<br />\nTheir attack is led by sophomore and second-team<br />\nAll-American Mike Herger. Alongside Herger will<br />\nbe senior Paul Basile and junior Brain Keith, an<br />\nhonorable mention All-American.<br />\nMidfield saw the departure of standout Frank<br />\nSnyder, but capable replacements await. This year's<br />\nmidfield will be anchored by seniors Jeff Scott, Tom<br />\nHanzsche, Ed Iocco, Marvin Campbell, and Brian<br />\nSullivan. Many promising underclassmen will also<br />\nsee action here.<br />\nThough the defense suffered the loss of Jim Darcy and Mick Amatuccio, ten letter-winners return.<br />\nAmong those back for another season are seniors<br />\nMark Kapral, Dan Smalley, Tony Iuculano, Shan<br />\nSee TOP FIFTEEN, 9<br /><br />\n4...a\u2022Neuenumusasu<br /><br />\n(within walking distance)<br /><br />\n711 W. 40th Street<br />\n467-7777<br />\n\u2022 Students Welcome<br />\nBeer on Sale All the Time<br />\nQuantity and Party Discounts<br />\nTuesdays and Wednesdays 10% Off<br />\nAll Wines, Excluding Sales<br />\nChecks and Charges Accepted<br /><br />\nLACROSSE .89/9<br /><br />\nschools round out the top fifteen<br />\nTOP FIFTEEN, from 8<br />\nByrne, and Joe Schweitzer.<br />\nUndoubtedly the biggest loss that Navy had at<br />\ngraduation was the departure of honorable mention<br />\nAll-American goalie Joe Donnelly. Not only will his<br />\nperformance on the field be missed, but also his<br />\npresence as team leader. He will be replaced by either<br />\njunior Louis Brown or senior Tim McElligatt.<br />\n7) University of Pennsylvania Quakers:<br />\nCoach Tony Seaman's squad tied Yale for last<br />\nyear's Ivy Championship and fell one goal short of<br />\nknocking off Syracuse in the semifinals of last years<br />\nNCAA tournament. The big loss is at the midfield,<br />\nwhere Ivy Player of the Year and first-team AllAmerican Chris Flynn has graduated and taken his<br />\ntalents to the New England Patriots.<br />\nPeter Smith, Steve Stoll, John Lyons, and Chris<br />\nConforti lead the attack. Smith, a second team AllIvy selection, will be counted on to do most of the<br />\nscoring. The midfield position is led by Stewart<br />\nFisher, a returning All-American, as well as John<br />\nGreco. Ed McMahon and Keith McCartney, both<br />\nAll-American caliber defensemen, departed last year.<br />\nSenior Paul Konkel is the lone remaining starter. In<br />\ngoal will be sophomore Jeremy Sigler, replacing the<br />\ntalented John Kanaras.<br />\n8) Cornell Big Red:<br />\nAlas, Coach Richie Moran will be without the exploits of attackman Tim Goldstein. He held Cornell's march to the Final Four both in 1987 and again<br />\nin 1988, only to fall to defeat in the final game of<br />\neach season.<br />\nBesides Goldstein, Cornell's attack will also be<br />\nwithout honorable mention All-American John Wurzburger. This season, the scoring load will be carried by senior Steve \"the Stork\" Meyer, as well as<br />\njunior Bill O'Hanlon.<br />\nMidfield will be directed by another All-American<br />\nhonorable mention, junior Vince Angotti. He will<br />\nbe teamed with senior Tim McDevitt and junior Mike<br />\nCummings.<br />\nWith the departure of the majority of Cornell's offense at graduation, the Big Red will rely on a formidable defense to combat their Ivy and non-Ivy foes.<br />\nThe long sticks are led by junior John Rossettie and<br />\nsophomore Pat Leahy. Once again, Cornell will be<br />\nanchored by goalie Paul Schmimoler, who last year<br />\nwas an honorable mention All-American.<br />\nCornell has a very rich lacrosse tradition, and<br />\nCoach Moran has captured fifteen Ivy titles in his<br />\ntwenty years at the helm. If his young attack can play<br />\neffectively, Cornell may indeed return for its third<br />\ntrip to the finals in the last three years.<br />\n9) Massachusetts Minutemen:<br />\nAlthough not as deep as many of the traditional<br />\nlacrosse powers of the mid-Atlantic and New York<br />\nregions, the Minutemen have an experienced and<br /><br />\ntalented nucleus that Coach Dick Garber hopes<br />\nwill carry them into the NCAA's. They don't begin<br />\ncompetition until the end of March, when they travel<br />\nto California, but their schedule includes top teams<br />\nsuch as Cornell, Brown, and Syracuse.<br />\nThe attack is led by third-team All-American Scott<br />\nHiller, who has replaced Tom Carmean as UMass's<br />\ntop scoring threat. He is teamed with honorable mention All-American Jim NIcAleveay. UMass suffered<br />\na great loss with the departure of long stick middie<br />\nGlenn Stephens. The minutemen will count on a<br />\ntalented group of young players to mature at the midfield position. Indeed, this is the key to their playoff<br />\nasperations.<br />\nOn the defensive end, UMass is well stocked.<br />\nAlthough Matt Woods is gone, they are anchored<br />\nby goalie Sal LoCascio, last season's third-team AllAmerican. If the scorers and LoCascio can play up<br />\nto their potential and capable midfielders emerge,<br />\nthere may by much to cheer about in Amhearst.<br />\n10) Loyola Greyhounds:<br />\nThe Greyhounds are coming off a 12-2 season, including their first-ever berth in the NCAA tournament. Although many of last year's starters have<br />\ngraduated, their following on Charles Street is anticipating another post-season opportunity.<br />\nThey are led by attackman Mike Ruland, a second<br />\nteam All-American. Although small in stature, he<br />\nwill shoulder a great amount of the scoring responsibilities. He will have much influence in determining how far this squad will go in May.<br />\nThe starting midfield will be Brian Kroneberger,<br />\nBrian Letz, and Ted Nichols. This experienced group<br />\nwill be an asset to Coach Kadal.<br />\nThe defense is anchored by Mike Ready and emerging sophomore Tom Johnson. Although second-team<br />\nAll-American goalie Tim McClelland has departed,<br />\nthe capable Charlie Tooney is eager to show many<br />\nthat he too can lead Loyola to the playoffs.<br />\n11) Harvard Crimson:<br />\nYes, that Harvard! After last season's explosion<br />\ninto the playoffs, Cambridge is buzzing about the<br />\nCrimson's chances this year. Rooie Coach Scott<br />\nAnderson led Harvard to and 11-4 record, good for<br />\na first round NCAA game against Navy, which they<br />\nlost in overtime.<br />\nThree starters return as attack, led by 1988 Ivy<br />\nRookie of the Year and honorable mention AllAmerican Mickey Cuvotti. He is teamed with Ivy<br />\nstandout junior David Kramer, as well as senior Brad<br />\nRaymond.<br />\nJunior Perry Dodge leads a very experienced midfield unit which also boasts three returning starters.<br />\nThe others are seniors Steve Lux and Rob Griffith.<br />\nTwo starters on defense are also back, juniors<br />\nChris Bentley and Mike Murphy.<br />\nThe only inexperienced position for the Crimson<br />\nthis year will be in goal, where All-Ivy performer<br />\nMike Bergmann has graduated. His likely replacement will by Tom Shebar.<br />\n112) Yale Elis:<br />\nSurprised? Well, so were many followers of the<br />\nlacrosse world after last year's Cinderella performance by these boys from New Haven. While many<br />\nopponents took them lightly, they played with intensity and skill on the way to a 12-4 record and the<br />\nnumber seven seed in the NCAA's. Now that Coach<br />\nMike Waldvogel and the rest of the Elis have had<br />\ntheir first taste of post-season play, they are sure to<br />\nhave a healthy appetite for more.<br />\nThe attack will need to rebuild after the departure<br />\nof three starters. Last year's attack combined for 108<br />\ngoals and 51 assists. Scoring will be supplied in<br />\nearnest by a very strong midfield corps. Junior John<br />\nReese was second in the Ivies in scoring last year,<br />\nand was .11so an honorable mention All-American.<br />\nHe is joined by senior Mike Babcock, another AllAmerican standout. The third starter is senior Keith<br />\nJoseph.<br />\nThe defense is led by junior Bryan Martin, yet<br />\nanother honorable mention All-American. In goal will<br />\nbe the Ivy leader in save percentage, junior Chris<br />\nSwanenburg. If the Elis can field three effective attackmen, they will demonstrate that 1988 was no<br />\nfluke.<br /><br />\n13) Rutgers Scarlet Knights:<br />\nCoach Tom Hayes leads 37 returning lettermen into the 71st campaign of Rutgers lacrosse. The attack<br />\nboasts the return of four of last year's top five<br />\nscorers. They will be led by Andy DeCicco, M.G.<br />\nHollingsworth, Steve Luciano, and Peter Tortorella.<br />\nUnlike teams of the past, this year's edition features<br />\na balanced offense, making it difficult for the opposition to key in on one particular threat.<br />\nThe midfield position is also loaded with veterans.<br />\nThey will be anchored by third team All-American<br />\nGreg Rinaldi, who led the Scarlet Knights in scoring a year ago. Another mainstay is tri-captain and<br />\nface-off man Lou Fusilli. The third starter is junior<br />\nDoug Beeler.<br />\nOn defense, only one starter has departed. The top<br />\nlong stick man is All-American Marc Moreau. He<br />\nwill be teamed with Jim Eckert and Tim Pritts.<br />\nIn goal, Rutgers lost standout Jim Gilman. There<br />\nwill be fierce competition among three hopefuls for<br />\nthe starting job.<br />\n14) Brown University Bruins:<br />\nThe fifth Ivy league squad in our poll may pull<br />\na few surprises before the season is over. Although<br />\nCoach Don Starsia lost some key performers from<br />\nlast season, sources close to lacrosse see the Bruins<br />\nas one of 1989's dark horses.<br />\nAt attack is honorable mention All-Ivy senior Jamie<br />\nMunro, who will be teamed with two young players.<br />\nSome of the scoring slack will be taken up by an<br />\nestablished midfield unit which features junior Rich<br />\nTuohey and sophomore May McMahon.<br />\nThe defense includes senior Dave Kotowski and<br />\njunior Lars Tiffany. They will be asked to fill the<br />\nvoid created by the departure of first team AllAmerican Bill McComas.<br />\nIn goal, replacing Jamie Smiles will be junior Steve<br />\nAyers, who was a starter for the Bruins as a freshman<br />\nduring their surprising year of 1987. Brown suffered<br />\nthree losses by only one goal last season. If they can<br />\ncome up on the winning end of these close battles<br />\nthey may well return to the NCAA tournament.<br />\n15) Army Cadets:<br />\nThe squad from West Point is hopeful that 1989<br />\nmight see the Cadets return to the NCAA tournament after a disappointing campaign a year ago.<br />\nCoach Jack Emmer has seventeen lettermen returning; there are, however, two very important absences<br />\nthis season. This first is Rob Betchley, a second team<br />\nAll-American attackman last year. He led the Cadets<br />\nin scoring and providing much frustration to Hopkins<br />\nplayers and coachers in his final three seasons. Also<br />\ngone is goalie Joel Portuese, who was the backbone<br />\nof the Army defensive corps.<br />\nOn attack, Army will be led by seniors Bill Tohill<br />\nand Scott Frank. They will be joined by sophomore<br />\nJohn Mone. Other performers without varsity experience should also see action.<br />\nThe middies are the most experienced unit of the<br />\nteam. They will be led by seniors John Sheehan,<br />\nMike Dieroff. and Steve Haugenes as well as junior<br />\nJoe Kane. Defensive middies include senior Pete<br />\nMavoides and juniors Joe Olmeda and Brian<br />\nNakamura.<br />\nOn defense will be seniors Buck French and Gary<br />\nGiglio. They will be matched with juniors John<br />\nO'Grady and Jim Williams. The competition for the<br />\nstarting goalie slot is between sophomore Rob Salter<br />\nand junior Joe Bruno.<br /><br />\n10/MARCH 3, 1989<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkin<br />\nHomewc<br />\nSaturday,<br />\n2:00<br /><br />\nMN&amp; AjOriffis#<br />\nilir.4611111t<br />\nIP ~IP<br /><br />\nIk<br /><br />\nfrik<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins Blue Jays<br />\nProbable Starters<br />\n22<br />\n21<br />\n19<br />\n32<br />\n17<br />\n36<br />\n37<br />\n42<br />\n43<br />\n11<br /><br />\nMatt Panetta<br />\nJeff lhm<br />\nJay Clarke<br />\nBrendan Kelly<br />\nJohn Wilkens<br />\nBrian Lukacz<br />\nGreg Lilly<br />\nSteve Ciccarone<br />\nDave Pietramala<br />\nQuint Kessenich<br /><br />\nAttack<br />\nAttack<br />\nAttack<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nDefense<br />\nDefense<br />\nDefense<br />\nGoalie<br /><br />\nLACROSSE '89/11<br /><br />\nins vs. Syracuse<br />\n,vood Field<br />\ny, March 4<br />\n10 p.m.<br /><br />\nPhoto by David Preece<br /><br />\nThe Syracuse Orangemen<br />\nProbable Starters<br />\n11<br />\n14<br />\n9<br />\n19<br />\n22<br />\n6<br />\n29<br />\n32<br />\n18<br />\n10<br /><br />\nJohn Zulberti<br />\nJohn Burns<br />\nJim Egan<br />\nPaul Gait<br />\nGary Gait<br />\nRodney Dumpson<br />\nPat McCabe<br />\nMark Stopher<br />\nJim McNamara<br />\nMatt Palumb<br /><br />\nAttack<br />\nAttack<br />\nAttack<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nMidfield<br />\nDefense<br />\nDefense<br />\nDefense<br />\nGoalie<br /><br />\n12/MARCH 3, 1989<br /><br />\n1988 Jays battled back in spite of poor start<br />\nby Andy Prior<br />\nThe Hopkins lacrosse season got off to a shaky<br />\nstart. Just one month into the season, the disciplinary<br />\nsuspension of three players, a 19-7 opening-day loss<br />\nto Syracuse University, and the resignation of three<br />\nadditional players had created a sense of turmoil.<br />\nDespite these set-backs, the Blue Jays managed to<br />\nregroup for nine consecutive wins to finish the regular<br />\nseason at 9-1, ranked second in NCAA Division<br />\nI. The Hopkins season ended abruptly, however,<br />\nwhen they were eliminated 11-10 in overtime by the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia in quarter-final play.<br />\nA month before the opener against Syracuse, star<br />\ngoalie Quint Kessenich was suspended for one game<br />\nby head coach Don Zimmerman. Kessenich and two<br />\nteammates, defensemen Dave Howland and James<br />\nDeTommaso, had damaged furniture in the lobby of<br />\nthe Northway Apartment building. Howland also<br />\nreceived a one-month suspension, while DeTommaso<br />\nwas suspended for two weeks.<br />\nThe absence of Kessenich (despite a commendable<br />\neffort by Jeff Kramer) and Howland, along with a<br />\nporous Jay defense, combined for the worst defeat<br />\nin fifteen years. It was Coach Don Zimmerman's<br />\nworst defeat in his five-year tenure and marked the<br />\nfirst time that the Jays had lost by more than four<br />\ngoals under his coaching. At one point during the<br />\ngame the Jays were unable to score for 32:56.<br />\nFollowing the 19-7 blowout against Syracuse, three<br />\nJays resigned from the squad for what were termed<br />\npersonal reasons.

Even though Chic<br />\nhad suffered two previous heart attacks, there was<br />\nno doubt in any of our minds that he was going to<br />\nbeat this illness. Chic almost always had a way to<br />\nbeat the odds and to win\u2014whether in sports, games<br />\nof chance, or any type of competition. But this time<br />\nChic lost the battle, and great sadness has come to<br />\nhis family, his friends, and the entire lacrosse world<br />\nwhere he made an indelible mark.<br />\nChic entered Hopkins in the fall of 1958. He played<br />\non the freshman football team under Bob Scott, who<br />\nrealized then that Chic was an outstanding athlete<br />\nand a dynamic leader. All of his teammates enjoyed<br />\nhis outgoing personality and his great sense of humor.<br />\nHe began his lacrosse career at Hopkins the following spring on the freshman team coached by Fred<br />\nSmith, who became one of Chic's staunchest supporters and his personal friend. Chic played three<br />\nyears on the varsity football team for Wilson Fewster<br />\nand led the Blue Jays to Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nchampionships in 1959 and 1960. He was named to<br />\nthe All-Conference team as a single-wing tailback.<br />\nHe called all the offensive plays and was the obvious<br />\nteam leader. Chic ran the show on the lacrosse field<br />\nas well, and it was there that he really excelled. He<br />\nwas an All-American midfielder during each of his<br />\nthree years on the varsity, was team captain, and winner of just about every Hopkins award\u2014Penniman<br />\nAward for the best midfielder, Turnbull-Reynolds<br />\nAward for leadership, Erlanger Award for the best<br />\nsenior player, and selection to the All-Time Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team.<br />\nWhen Chic finished his playing career in 1962,<br />\nathletic director Marshall Turner hired him as an<br />\nassistant coach in football, basketball, and lacrosse.<br />\nChic was always at his best when the pressure was<br />\non. Whether it was sending in the play on a crucial<br />\nfourth-down situation in football, or setting up the<br />\nlast shot in a tied basketball or lacrosse game, Chic<br />\nthrived on making the tough decision. And he was<br />\nso good at it. Not too many people are aware that<br />\nChic was the head coach of Hopkins varsity basketball for six years. His teams beat Loyola College<br />\nthree times, and his 1967-68 team won the MAC<br />\nSoutheast League championship.<br />\nAfter seven years on the athletic staff, Chic left<br />\nHomewood in the summer of 1969 for a position in<br />\nthe business world. He did assist in coaching the '71<br /><br />\nlacrosse team as a part-timer. When Marshall Turner<br />\nretired as athletic director and turned the job over<br />\nto Bob Scott in the summer of 1973, Chic was immediately called and asked to return as a full-time<br />\nassistant in 1974 and head coach in 1975.<br />\nHe agreed and then proceeded to establish a truly<br />\nremarkable record over a nine-year period. The<br />\nhighlights of that illustrious career include: Playing<br />\nin seven consecutive NCAA Championship games<br />\n(1977-83), winning three consecutive NCAA Championships(1978,'79,'80), compiling a record of 105<br />\nwins and 16 losses, coaching 23 first-team AllAmericans and four Division I Players-of-the-year.<br />\nWithout a doubt, Chic ranks as one of the game's<br />\nbest coaches of all time. He left no stone unturned<br />\nin his preparations for his team's next game. He was<br />\na very demanding, hard-driving coach who would<br />\naccept nothing but the best from his players. Every<br />\nounce of Chic's energy went towards winning. He<br />\nwould often arrive at his Hopkins office at 6 a.m.<br />\nand would routinely leave after 7:30 p.m. He was<br />\nas tough a competitor as there has ever been in the<br />\ncoaching ranks.<br />\nChic was recognized for his accomplishments on<br />\nthe lacrosse field when he was inducted into the<br /><br />\nLacrosse Hall of Fame on January 30, 1988. How<br />\npleased his family and friends were that this highest<br />\nlacrosse honor was awarded to him! And there<br />\nweren't two happier and more proud people that night<br />\nthan his parents. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ciccarone attended just<br />\nabout every game Chic played or coached, and they<br />\nalways beamed with pride over \"their Henry.\"<br />\nIn like fashion, Chic and his wife Sue took great<br />\npride in their four sons who grew up in the thick of<br />\nthe Hopkins tradition. But it's rather unique that all<br />\nfour boys wanted to go to the same school that their<br />\nfather attended and to also play for him on the<br />\nlacrosse field. Henry Jr. and Brent did play for their<br />\ndad, but John and Steve were denied that privilege<br />\nwhen Chic decided to enter the business world in the<br />\nfall of 1983. Both John and Steve will be playing<br />\ntheir senior years at Hopkins this spring.<br />\n. The Ciccarone legend lives on, as do the wonderful memories of Chic's friendship\u2014the light-up<br />\nsmile, the little stories, the laughs, and the warm<br />\nuplift that came from being with him.<br />\nPlans are being made for an appropriate memorial<br />\nfor Chic, along with a get-together on Friday night,<br />\nApril 28, prior to the Homecoming game with Navy.<br /><br />\n******************************<br />\n1988 DIVISION I<br />\nALL-AMERICANS<br />\nFIRST TEAM<br />\n* Attack: Mike Morrill (Johns Hopkins)<br />\n\u2022<br />\nJohn Zulberti (Syracuse)<br />\nTim Goldstein (Cornell)<br />\nMidfield: Gary Gait (Syracuse)<br />\nPaul Gait (Syracuse)<br />\nChris Flynn (Pennsylvania)<br />\nAndy Kraus (Virginia)<br />\n* Defense:Boyd Harden (North Carolina)<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDave Pietramala (Johns Hopkins)<br />\nBill McComas (Brown)<br />\n* Goalie: Quint Kessenich (Johns Hopkins)<br />\nHenry Ciccarone, Sr. 1938-1988.<br /><br />\nSECOND TEAM<br />\n* Attack: Mike Ruland (Loyola)<br />\nRob Betchley (Army)<br />\nMike Herger (Navy)<br />\n* Midfield: Brendan Kelly (Johns Hopkins)<br />\nTom Worstell (Maryland)<br />\nTim Mclntee (CW Post)<br />\nTim Welsh (North Carolina)<br />\n\u2022<br />\n* Defense:Mark Stopher (Syracuse)<br />\nRob Schulper (Virginia)<br />\nBill Pennoyer (Harvard)<br />\n* Goalie: Tom McClelland (Loyola)<br /><br />\nTHIRD TEAM<br />\n\u2022<br />\n* Attack: Chase Monroe (Virginia)<br />\nScott Hiller (Massachusetts)<br />\nAdam Puritz (Yale)<br />\n*<br />\n* Midfield: Greg Rinaldi (Rutgers)<br />\nKevin Haus (North Carolina)<br />\nPhil Willard (Maryland)<br />\nGordon Purdie (Adelphi)<br />\n\u2022<br />\n* Defense Dan Coughlan (Maryland)<br />\nEd McMahon (Pennsylvania)<br />\nJames DeTommaso (Johns Hopkins):<br />\n* Goalie: Sal LoCascio (Massachusetts)<br />\n******************************<br /><br />\n14/MARCH 3, 1989<br /><br />\nSyracuse thinks that they have the talent to repeat<br />\nCourtesy of Syracuse Sports Information Dept.<br />\nGreat expectations will usually do one of two<br />\nthings\u2014motivate to success or cause such pressure<br />\nthat the level of perfection expected is unattainable.<br />\nCoach Roy Simmons Jr.'s Syracuse Orangemen are<br />\nabout to discover which road they will travel this<br />\nseason.<br />\nBy acclamation, Syracuse is the preseason number<br />\none team in the country. The defending NCAA<br />\nchampions lost only two starters from last year's team<br />\nand more than one person in the lacrosse world has<br />\nsuggested that the number two team in the country<br />\nis SU's second team. The Orangemen return Player<br />\nof the Year Gary Gait, twin brother Paul, and Attackman of the Year John Zulberti. All three were<br />\nfirst-team All-Americans last year. Also back is<br />\nsecond-team All-American defenseman Mark<br />\nStopher and honorable mention picks defenseman Pat<br />\nMcCabe, MVP of the Junior World Games last summer, defenseman Phil Schluter, and attackman Greg<br />\nBurns. Returning in goal is the MVP of last year's<br />\nchampionship game, Matt Palumb, who brings a 17-1<br />\ncareer record into the season.<br />\nIt certainly would appear that another banner year<br />\nis in store for the Orange. Syracuse has made a national leading six straight trips to the Final<br />\nFour, and the only surprise would be if they didn't<br />\nmake number seven. But Head Coach Roy Simmons<br />\nJr. remains guarded when the subject of back-to-back<br />\nchampionships comes up.<br />\n\"A year ago, everyone thought we would be lucky<br />\nto be much over .500 because of the large graduation,\" said Simmons. \"But we were hungry, determined, and came out strong. All of the games were<br />\non synthetic surface, which allowed us to play the<br />\nuptempo game we like to play. We got the number<br />\none ranking right away with the win over Hopkins<br />\nand the 15 games on synthetic fields played right into<br />\nour hands. We escaped injuries, the chemistry was<br />\nright, and everyone was unselfish.<br />\n\"Now we've got a look-alike team and everyone.<br />\nexpects us to repeat. But if you look at it, we're playing the Tigers on the road instead of at home, five<br />\nof our first six games are on the road and six of our<br />\ngames this year are on grass. I realize it's going to<br />\nbe very difficult to repeat. Everyone will gear their<br />\nseason towards tripping Syracuse up.\"<br />\nThat may well be, but don't count on it happening very often. With the exception ofjust a few key<br />\npeople, the 1989 Orangemen are the same team as<br />\nthe 1988 Orangemen\u2014with an added year's experience. This is a team that handed Johns Hopkins<br />\nits only regular season loss, a 19-7 demolition at<br />\nHomewood. SU beat teams by an average of 10 goals<br />\na game, winning by such scores as 19-7, 23-8, and<br />\n23-5 over quality teams like Cornell, UMass and<br />\nNavy. Yet the Orange also showed it could win the<br />\ntough ones, beating North Carolina in overtime and<br />\nPenn in the final seconds of the NCAA semifinals.<br />\nFrom the 15-0 record to Gary Gait's \"Air Gait\"<br />\nleap into lacrosse history to the record crowd of<br />\n20,007 for the NCAA championship game in the Carrier Dome, 1988 was a very special year for Orange<br />\nlacrosse. Here is a look at the pieces that must come<br />\ntogether for Syracuse to keep the crown:<br /><br />\nof them are one-dimensional.\"<br /><br />\nhigh school All-American Freddie Amaya. The second midfield will be made up of whoever is left from<br />\nthat competition, with two pretty fair new faces coming into the picture. Joe Bonacci, a two-year starter<br />\nat Navy, has transferred to SU, as has junior college All-America Dan Caughey from Herkimer.<br />\nFaceoff duties appeared to be a lock for Kirk Pratt,<br />\nwho Bill Dirrigl said was the only center in the country who could beat him last year. But Pratt is being<br />\npressed by Mike Magee and Paul Cannon. All three<br />\nshould see some action.<br /><br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nThe midfield suffered the most significant losses.<br />\nBill Dirrigl, one of the premier faceoff men in the<br />\ncountry and a co-captain, is gone, as is fellow cocaptain Neil Alt. Keith Owens led the Orangemen's<br />\nsecond midfield and his blinding speed will be missed<br />\nin man-down situations. Starter Brad Roos was the<br />\nperfect complement for the Gaits, with his size and<br />\ndefensive ability. Key losses, true, but will they be<br />\nenough to slow down the SU juggernaut?<br />\nThe Gaits are back and healthy and bring with them DEFENSE<br />\nWhile the Gaits and the rest of SU's high-powered<br />\na combined 117 goals from the 1988 season. Gary<br />\nis coming off one of the greatest seasons in lacrosse offense were getting the press and the accolades, the<br />\nhistory and Paul wants to show he can do more than Orange defense simply went out, game in and game<br />\nscore \"only\" 47 goals. These are probably the two out, and got the job done. Over the last 11 games of<br />\nfinest players in the country, if not beyond those the year, only Penn managed to score in double<br />\nfigures, squeaking through with 10 goals in the<br />\nboundaries.<br />\nSimmons: \"The Gaits are so complete, not only NCAA semifinal game.<br />\nSU's starting close defense returns intact, with se-4<br />\nwell versed in the game, but great, great athletes.<br />\nThey are the type of athletes that would be good at cond team All-American Mark Stopher, Jim<br />\nanything they decided to play.

I kind of hoped that we could have the<br />\nhome field advantage, and we have a wonderful community who loves us. I always look forward to having the Jays to Syracuse, because it's a treat for<br />\neveryone. We always have a wonderful crowd of<br />\ntwelve to fifteen thousand, and we've been denied<br />\nthat opportunity this year because of an extended<br />\nbasketball season. We are obviously in the entertainment business like any other big university, and<br />\ntickets sell for basketball and football, and that's the<br />\nname of the game. With a nationally televised game<br />\nagainst Georgetown on Sunday, they didn't want to<br />\ndisturb the surface, so I was told to take a hike. To<br />\nsafeguard against that in the future, we changed our<br />\nschedule time with Johns Hopkins, and next year it<br />\nwill be in the third week of March so that basketball<br />\nseason will be over and there won't ever be a problem again about the Jays coming to Syracuse. But<br />\nthis year, I've got to come back to Homewood. Not<br />\nthat I dislike Homewood, but given my choice, I<br />\nwould definitely love to be in the Dome every game.<br />\nIt's warm, it's predictable, it's dry, it's wonderful<br />\nfor the crowd, it's great for the game, and we feel<br />\ncomfortable.<br /><br />\nabout the throwing of oranges and the prospect that<br />\nit may happen again this year?<br /><br />\nSimmons: That's the problem with being represented<br />\nby a piece of fruit. I always say I'm lucky that we<br />\ndon't represent a coconut or a watermelon, because<br />\nthey hurt more. Oranges have a great velocity to them<br />\nin the air, and I got hit in the back of the head with<br />\none. It's annoying at the time, because you're trying to do your best and coach a bunch of young kids,<br />\nand somebody's literally throwing garbage at you.<br />\nIt's not the first time and it won't be the last, but<br />\nit happens. I guess Hopkins is very gentle, because<br />\nI know they advertised in the paper for their kids<br />\nto bring only rotten oranges, and I thought that was<br />\nso much better than what the University of<br />\nMassachusetts did. They advertised to their student<br />\nbody to bring their oranges and make sure they were<br />\nfrozen. The food service at UMass couldn't believe<br />\nthat they'd gone through some ten thousand more<br />\noranges than normal the week before we came there.<br />\nThe kids would take the oranges from the food service and bring them back to their apartments to freeze<br />\nthem. We found much more oranges as UMass than<br />\nwe did at Johns Hopkins. I'm just afraid that someone<br />\nis going to get hit. They do pick up a great deal of<br />\nN-L: Last year, the Hopkins fans barraged the play- velocity in the air, and it's annoying. It works in our<br />\ning field with oranges before the game, and you were favor usually, because if the crowd doesn't stop they<br />\nhit with one on the sidelines. How do you feel<br /><br />\nSimmons: When the Blue Jays and I decided to get<br />\ntogether, there really wasn't much opportunity to<br />\nplay. In the past, we really weren't worthy of playing the Jays, and when we made our program a little stronger, they had a natural schedule and so did<br />\nwe. We had a hard time finding a slot where we could<br />\nget together, although we concurred that it was important that we play one another, The only date open<br />\nwas that first week in March, and most schools don't<br />\neven start that early. Everyone thought that I was<br />\na little crazy taking the Jays on that early and that,<br />\nwith us coming out of the snow belt and with them<br />\nhaving synthetic surface and being a so-called<br />\nSouthern team, they'd be a little better prepared. But<br />\nI think the time to catch the Jays, if there's such<br />\na thing, is while they're making some adjustments<br />\nin positions and building confidence. We caught them<br />\noff-guard, and that's all, but they never lost another<br />\nSYRACUSE, from 14<br />\nball game last year. They went all the way to the<br />\nVirginia game, and even that game they were short- of Bill.<br />\nThe defensive midfield will include co-captain<br />\nhanded and riddled with injuries at key positions, and<br />\nthat boiled down to a one-goal game.

The only Division III schools<br />\non the schedule are nine-time NCAA champion<br />\nSimmons: Yes. We love the Carrier Dome, and Hobart and perennial playoff contender Cortland, one<br />\nwe've only lost three games in nine years, so there's of only two schools to ever beat the Orange in the<br />\ngot to be something to being at home. It's a very, Carrier Dome.<br />\nvery fast surface [in the Dome], faster than<br />\nSU opens with road games against Johns Hopkins,<br /><br />\nNorth Carolina, and Adelphi, plays Cortland at home<br />\nand then hits the road again for Towson State at the<br />\nDay of Champions and Brown. Following a oneweek reprieve at home against Hofstra, it's off to<br />\nHobart. The Orange then plays Cornell, Rutgers, and<br />\nPenn at home before finishing the regular season at<br />\nUMass. It is a difficult scenario for a repeat of the<br />\nnational championship.

Expectations are<br />\nhigh for Coach Simmons and his Orangemen and the<br />\npressure on themselves to try and build upon a 15-0<br />\nnational championship season may be the greatest<br />\npressure of all. This team isn't just favored to win<br />\nthe national championship, it is supposed to win the<br />\nnational championship. If they do, they were supposed to. If they don't, it will be \"what went<br />\nwrong?\"<br />\n\"Any pressure we feel will be what we put on<br />\nourselves,\" said Simmons. \"Self-fulfillment.

They used to throw bananas<br />\nat Patrick Ewing, and that's just an awful insult. I<br />\nremember when Sonny Dove played basketball and<br />\nthey used to let doves go in the coliseum. I guess<br />\nthe fans are imaginative and sometimes cruel. They<br />\nplayers are there to play the game the best that they<br />\nknow how. They really work at it, and they don't<br />\nlike the game interrupted and stalled. We don't like<br />\nto get hit, and of course to hit the coach was probably a great feather in somebody's cap. The Hopkins<br />\nfans are overzealous, and I accept that. You feel like<br />\na gladiator when you're in that situation, because you<br />\nreally can't control it. I felt very bad for Mr. Scott,<br />\nwho is a great sportsman and a wonderful gentleman,<br />\nbecause he was very upset.

Did you feel that the final four was missing something without the Blue Jays last year?<br />\nSimmons: Yes. When you talk about lacrosse, it's<br />\nsynonymous with the Blue Jays. If they're not the<br />\nboss, they stub their toe at the very last minute, with<br />\nsomebody taking it away from them by a goal or two.<br />\nIt's unique. I am so proud of our several national<br />\nchampionship trophies, and other schools don't have<br />\nany. And then when I step into the Newton White<br />\nAthletic Center and I look into the case and see that<br />\nlineup, it looks like a depository of nationai championship trophies that maybe a distributor might have.<br />\nThat's reality. They've been the boss, and they'll<br />\nconsider to be one of the best. We have all the respect<br />\nin the world for them.<br />\nN-L: What are your opinions of this year's Hopkins<br />\nsquad and how do you see this year's match-up between the Jays and the Orangemen?<br /><br />\nSimmons: I think they're very strong defensively, and I happen to personally know a bunch of kids<br />\nthey've got because we recruited them. If! wanted<br />\nthem and they were certainly good enough to play<br />\nfor me, they're going to come back to haunt me.

You've got Greg<br />\nKelly there, a big kid from St. Anthony's on Long<br />\nIsland who we had hoped to get into an Orange jersey<br />\nalso, but he's a Blue Jay now, and I think he's going to be a big part of of this 1989 Hopkins team.<br />\nSo we're familiar with the personnel.

Even worse, you might have to sit in the<br />\nend zone, or on the side away from the benches,<br />\nwhere visiting fans usually sit. (The University, in<br />\nanticipation of large crowds, has installed additional<br />\nbleachers on the away side, but those also fill up<br />\nquickly for big games.)

The two face-off men line up on opposite sides<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nof the center line, while the goalkeeper and three<br />\n\u2022 (played at start of each halt)<br />\nother players are confined to the defensive goal area,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthree players are confined to the attack goal area,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nvict'ry,<br />\nto<br />\non<br />\nHopkins<br />\n\u2022 Johnny<br />\nand one player remains in each of the wing areas (see<br />\n\u2022 Johnny Hopkins play the game;<br />\nfield diagram).

When one team is offside, a<br />\n\u2014words by Conrad Gebelein,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBand 192440\u2022 technical penalty is called against that team (see<br />\nJHU<br />\nDirector,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022 below).<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n*Legal player actions: \"Bodychecking\" of an opponent in possession of the ball or within five yards<br />\nof a loose ball, from the front or side above the knees<br />\nand below the neck, is legal. A player may check<br />\nSIMMONS, from 16<br />\nhis opponent's crosse with his own crosse when the<br />\nit might be that our first time in a real live situation opponent has control of the ball or is within five yards<br />\nwill be there at Homewood. So I pretty much know of a loose ball or when the ball is in flight within<br />\nthe personnel of the team [Hopkins], but I don't know five yards of the player.<br />\nthe chemistry of the team and how they play together.<br />\n*Personal fouls: These include illegal bodycheckI know who they have. I know of people like Jay<br />\nClarke and Quint, and of course you've got the<br />\nnumber one defenseman in the nation [Dave<br />\nPietramala], and he's a New York state boy that<br />\nwe've seen play a lot. So we know what we're walking into, we just don't know how it's put together,<br />\nand we'll probably have to make some adjustments<br />\non the fourth [March].<br /><br />\nSimmons predictions<br /><br />\nN-L: If you were to make any predictions about<br />\nteams to watch this year, particularly any sleeper<br />\nteams, what would they be and why?<br />\nSimmons: Well, I think Brown is going to be the<br />\nstrong Ivy League team this year. I know Yale came<br />\nout strong last year, and Penn was obviously very<br />\nstrong. I think the Ivies could be represented by<br />\nBrown University this year. I think they had a very<br />\nyoung team [last year], but I think they've matured<br />\nenough now to be a real force. I think in the North<br />\nEast, that's the team that could be there. From your<br />\nway down, I know that Virginia has some fine personnel, and I think that once they develop a lot of<br />\nconfidence in themselves and one another, they could<br />\nbe a real force to be dealt with. And North Carolina<br />\nis always strong. It's hard to say, but I think Virginia<br />\nand Brown were two teams that were almost there<br />\nlast year, and those would be my guesses.<br /><br />\ning, slashing, crosse-checking, tripping, unnecessary<br />\nroughness, unsportsmanlike conduct, and the use of<br />\nan illegal crosse. Watch for these to see just what<br />\nthey are. There is a lot of subjectivity in the calling<br />\nof these fouls\u2014it depends mostly on the mood of the<br />\nreferees. The penalty for a personal foul is suspension from the game for one to three minutes, depending on the severity of the foul. The offender's team<br />\nplays short-handed during the penalty.<br />\n*Expulsion fouls: A player will be suspended for<br />\nthe remainder of the game for really nasty attempts<br />\nto injure or for committing five personal fouls.<br />\nHowever, the penalized team is allowed to substitute<br />\nfor the expelled player.<br />\n*Technical fouls: These are less serious fouls and<br />\nother rules violations. These include interference,<br />\nillegal screening, holding, pushing, touching the ball<br />\nwith the hands, withholding the ball from play,<br />\nthrowing the crosse, illegal procedure (a very broad<br />\ncategory, indeed), stalling, illegal equipment, and<br />\ncrease violations. The penalty for a technical foul<br />\nis either a 30-second penalty (if the offending team<br />\ndoes not have possession of the ball at the time the<br />\nfoul is committed) or simply loss of possession of<br />\nthe ball (if the offending team does have possession.)<br />\n*Penalty enforcement: A penalized player will<br />\nremain off the field (and his team plays one man<br />\ndown)for the duration of the penalty time unless the<br />\nother team scores a goal or the penalized team gains<br />\npossession of the ball in its attack goal area.<br />\n*Out of bounds: When the ball is thrown out of<br />\nbounds by one team, possession is awarded to the<br />\nother team, unless the ball was deemed a shot-ongoal that went out-of-bounds. In this case, possession is awarded to the team, one of whose in-bounds<br />\nplayers was closest to the ball when it crossed the<br />\nboundary line.<br />\n*Crease Privileges:No opposing player is allowed<br />\nin the goal crease area at any time. They may reach<br />\ninto the crease with their sticks to play a loose ball,<br />\nas long as they don't make contact with the goalie<br />\nor his stick. Furthermore, a defending player, including the goalkeeper, with the ball in his possession, may not enter the goal-crease area. Nor may<br />\nhe remain in the goal-crease area in possession of<br />\nthe ball longer than four seconds.<br />\n*Time-outs: Each team is allowed to call two<br />\ntimeouts per half and one per each sudden-death<br />\nperiod. Timeouts can be called when the ball is dead<br />\nby either team or by the team with the possession<br />\nof the ball in the attacking half of the field. The coach<br />\nor the captain of the team can call a timeout.<br />\nWell, there you have some of the basic rules of<br />\nthe game of lacrosse. Some of them may seem sort<br />\nof strange to those of you who are new to the sport,<br />\nbut after you see a few games, you'll get the hang<br />\nof it and even start second guessing the refs (who<br />\nare almost never right, anyway).<br /><br />\nA look at the 1989 women's lacrosse team<br /><br />\nPhotos by Bob Nelson<br /><br />\nWOMEN'S LACROSSE<br />\n1989 SCHEDULE<br />\nTues., Mar. 14\u2014at Notre Dame-4:00 p.m.<br />\nFri., Mar. 17\u2014home vs. Washington College4:00 p.m.<br />\nSat., Mar. 25\u2014home vs. Roanoke-11:00 a.m.<br />\nMon., Mar. 27\u2014home vs. Plymouth State-7:00 p.m.<br />\nFri., Mar. 31\u2014home vs. Haverford-4:00 p.m.<br />\nTue., Apr. 4\u2014home vs. Dickinson-6:30 p.m.<br />\nThu., Apr. 6\u2014at Gettysburg-3:30 p.m.<br />\nSat., Apr. 8\u2014home vs. Swarthmore-11:00 a.m.<br />\nTue., Apr. 11\u2014at Western Maryland-4:00 p.m.<br />\nSat., Apr. 15\u2014at Franklin &amp; Marshall-11:00 a.m.<br />\nMon., Apr. 17\u2014home vs. Widener-7:00 p.m.<br />\nWed., Apr. 19\u2014at Mary Washington-4:00 p.m.<br />\nSat., Apr. 22\u2014home vs. Hood-11:00 a.m.<br />\nTue., Apr. 25\u2014home vs. Georgetown-4:00 p.m.<br />\nFri., Apr. 28-Sun., Apr. 30\u2014MCWLT Tournament<br /><br />\nLookfor the women's lacrosse preview in next week's News-Letter!<br />\nri,44,****444,4\u201e44\u202244,4,\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n*<br />\n** Good Luck Jays! i<br />\nthe<br />\n**<br />\n*<br />\nfrom<br />\n\u2022<br />\ni<br />\n*<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nP.J.'s Pub<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe News-Letter wishes<br />\nBlue Jays success in<br />\ntheir quest for the 1989<br />\nNCAA lacrosse title.<br />\nAttention Fans!!<br />\nBe sure to come out tomorrow at 2 PM to cheer the<br />\nJays on to a crushing home<br />\nvictory over Syracuse!!<br />\nu ON JAY !<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022*<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.<br /><br />\n'p\u2022<br /><br />\nCRUSH<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n4,<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022*<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 THE ORANGE! .<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n*\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022*<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n'p<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nSee You After<br />\nThe Game<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n4,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n******************************************0*<br /><br />\n20/MARCH 3, 1989<br /><br />\nThe Second Annual Lax Quiz<br />\nWin a stick from<br />\nby Michael Farbowitz<br /><br />\nSponsored by STX<br />\n\"The world's standard of excellence in lacrosse\"<br /><br />\nAh, Springtime.

Even more<br />\nimportant than the MCAT is Hopkins lacrosse,<br />\nwhen Hoppies forget about their homework and<br />\nemerge from their subterranean carrels on D-level<br />\nto cheer for one of Division l's best lacrosse<br />\nteams. Well, here's a chance to show everyone<br />\nhow much you know (or think you know) about<br />\nHopkins lacrosse. Some of the questions are really easy, others border on the impossible, but all<br />\nare answerable, using the resources available on<br />\ncampus (i.e. being really good friends with a lax<br />\nplayer). The person who submits the entry with<br />\nthe most correct answers by 4 p.m. Wednesday<br />\nto the Gatehouse (News-Letter Office) will be<br />\ndeclared the winner. Ties will be broken using a<br />\nrandom drawing. This week's prize is not just a<br />\ncase of beer and a certificate for groceries at a<br />\nlocal food establishment, but a prize more befitting the topic of the quiz. Females get a date with<br />\nthe lacrosse player of their choice, and males get<br />\na date with the girlfriend of the lacrosse player<br />\nof their choice. Just kidding, we wouldn't ask the<br />\nlax players to give that much of themselves to<br />\nHopkins, they take enough punishment on the<br />\nfield as it is.
