ROBERTS<br />\nCollege students very often become too accustomed - to their<br />\nbuildings and campus. After a<br />\nnew class schedule has become<br />\nfamiliar routine, the physical surroundings are<br />\nalmost always<br />\nthought of in terms of that routine<br />\nand<br />\nits extra-curricular<br />\ndiversions. Generaly, school buildings adopt the form of those<br />\nplaces where classes or labs are<br />\nheld, while the campus receives<br />\neven less attention.<br />\nHere at Hopkins the same situation seems to exist. There are,<br />\non the Homewood campus, a little<br />\nless than twenty structures. Dur-<br />\n<br />\nmetrical whole\" by a donation of<br />\nmoney to defray the costs of working out preliminary plans. The<br />\nUniversity accepted the money<br />\nand advice; deliberately they<br />\nnoted the plan, or lack of such,<br />\nin other schools, measured the<br />\nneeds of the University's departments and sought the guidance of<br />\narchitects. In order to insure an<br />\nunbroken harmony of design, a<br />\npermanent<br />\nboard<br />\nof advisorarchitects :was established.<br />\nCarroll Mansion<br />\nSoon these men were judging<br />\nplans for the Homewood site development submitted in invitational competition. While much of<br />\n<br />\nthe qaestion of what to do with<br />\nbuildings already on campus. The<br />\nCarroll Mansion, its barn, the<br />\nWyman house, its gatehOuse and<br />\ncaretaker's home were treated by<br />\nthe University differently.<br />\nThe wisdom of sparing the<br />\nBarn becomes apparent when one<br />\nconsiders its over-all charm, from<br />\nthe little cupola to the arty gothicism of its west windows, and when<br />\none realizes how well it has<br />\nadapted itself to the curricular<br />\nand extra-curricular needs of the<br />\nUniversity. While the Wyman<br />\nestate's, caretaker's house has become the Student Clinic and the<br />\ngatehouse is a small laboratory,<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nIT CAN HAPPEN HERE<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\nThe case of the honor code violators at West Point caused<br />\nits impact of shock because the military academy had been so universally synonymous in people's minds with all that is honor and<br />\ncharacter in a gentleman. But never, when human beings are<br />\nconcerned, is there immunity to weakness.<br />\nIntellectual strength and strength of character were placed<br />\nside by side by Dr. Bronk in his address last Tuesday evening.<br />\nWith this merging of the two qualities, the educator spoke in the<br />\ntradition of higher learning generally and of our own university<br />\nin particular. \"The truth of God will make you free\" is a high<br />\nstandard, but the least possible standard.<br />\nThe freedom of truth\u2014the absurdity and futility of being<br />\nfalse to oneself\u2014is the basis for an honor system at the Hopkins.<br />\nIt is an ideal, a conception of things not as they always are but<br />\nas they should be. Despite the pedestal on which it is placed,<br />\nhonor is inseparable from Johns Hopkins and its purpose. Without<br />\nthis ideal our university would not be almost the same, nor nearly<br />\nperfect; it would be impossible.<br />\nFor the student who enters its doors this year, as well as for<br />\nthose who are already here, there will be temptations to cheat.<br />\nTo many of the newcomers the system, with its absence of proctoring, will bring amazement. But as the initial wonder wears off,<br />\nthe satisfaction that such freedom invokes will begin to take root.<br />\nIt is then that, at the merest though of yielding to any of the<br />\nalways-present temptations, the student must arm himself with<br />\nmilitant disgust.<br />\nTo make the system work every other part of the whole school<br />\nmust feel shocked and sad in the event of a violation. The honor<br />\nsystem is a massive but personal thing that depends on both the<br />\nunity . of the university and the strength of each individual.<br />\nWest Point dismissals come and public indignations go, and<br />\nit one fact remains adamant. The educated man withthrough<br />\nall<br />\nout character is in a complete sense uneducated, and useless both<br />\nto himself and to the world. The Hopkins student who violates<br />\nour honor code cheats, our whole university and all it stands for,<br />\ning<br />\nbut most devastatingly he cheats himself.<br />\n<br />\nNOT FAR ENOUGH<br />\nFirst to congratulate, then to criticize the Student Council<br />\non their first major undertaking of the school year.<br />\nFor many years the Freshmen coming to Hopkins were expected to choose their class leaders during the short space of the<br />\nOrientation Week proceedings. Needless to gay this was a very<br />\npoor policy and should never have existed.<br />\nThis week, Gil Snyder, Student Council head, who once was<br />\nelected to the presidency of his freshman class under this haphazard<br />\nsystem, announced this year's Frosh elections would be held two<br />\nweeks after Orientation Week.<br />\nThis was a step in the right direction. However, it seems like<br />\ntoo short a step and almost as useless a plan as wa the former.<br />\nIt will be aid, of course, that the Freshmen must organize<br />\nearly in their Hopkins career in order to carry out their social<br />\nactivities. Would it not be possible for the Sophomore Class to lend<br />\na guiding hand during at least the first, term, and then to hold<br />\nelections after it is seen which of the Frosh display the most interest<br />\nin their Mass activities?<br />\nThe Freshman social calendar is not very active and most of<br />\nthe plans emulate from the upperclassmen: so why rush something<br />\nthat is really unnecessary?<br />\nWait until the second term and let the titles of President,<br />\nVice-President, Secretary and Treasurer fall On the shoulders of<br />\nthe capable and the deserving.<br />\n<br />\nHON1EWOOD HOUSE, source of architectural inspiration for entire Charles Street campus,<br />\n<br />\nthe course of the day, one<br />\nmay be vaguely aware of a number of these and enter only a few<br />\nof them.

Though there<br />\nwere no funds for large scale construction, the Homewood Committee directed improvements and<br />\nminor developments, such as the<br />\nbotanical gardens, an athleticfield<br />\nand laboratory.

The first of course was Fred Smith who stepped<br />\nright into the head laertibse duties last year. Both men were<br />\nall-Americans. Until the chill of winter conies to Baltimore<br />\nand while the snow lies over Homewood, Sollers will be taking<br />\na teacher training course at Hopkins. But as soon as spring<br />\ncomes around he'll he the man in charge of developing and<br />\nnourishing the seed of another Jay lacrosse generation.<br />\nThis 'Nester feels it's a very smart move on the part of the<br />\nathletic department to get the services of both Sollers and Fred<br />\nSmith. Lacrosse as a game has, certainly, plenty of room for<br />\nexpansion.<br />\nFor expansion this sport needs new men, young men, to<br />\ntake over coaching duties. The Hopkins policy appears to he<br />\n\"give the young graduates the chance of experience ..<br />\nand as long as there are schools such as Hopkins and men<br />\nsuch as these there need be no fear of a decline in the popu<br />\nlarity of lacrosse.<br />\nSollers began his stick playing at Boy's Latin here in Baltimore. in his final year there he was named All-Maryland goalie.<br />\nThen followed three straight years as the guardian of the Hopkins<br />\ncage. In his junior year he was named second-string all-American<br />\nand, although the all-American rating for last season won't be<br />\nout for a about a month, Joe is a prohibative favorite to get a firststring berth.<br />\nThus Joe has the inside track for the honor of being the<br />\nyoungest Hopkins coach. Fred Smith is a hardy vet of a<br />\nyear's experience, Frank Burns is a comparative elder being<br />\ntwo years out of college, Carl Rees is two years out of Springfield, and Mac Erwin shed the old school tie of Davidson just<br />\ntwo years ago.<br />\nWith all these youlig coaches sharing the Ifopkins duties,<br />\nmention might be made of the fact that once again the \",Lily<br />\nWhite\" policy shows itself in its full light. Pick up any sports<br />\npage of a downto'Tm newspaper and you'll find a story of some<br />\nbig name coach getting an offer from sonic other school or of some<br />\nschool with a luminous athletic reputation looking over the prospects of geting some ranking coach. These coaches are bought<br />\nby higher salary offers, just as these schools buy 'ball players.<br />\nAlthough vigorous denials will always be made, tuitions are paid,<br />\na high paying job arranged for which entails very little work<br />\nif any at all, and arrangements are made to keep the boys in<br />\nschool despite poor grades. Thus ball players are purchased.<br />\nCoaches are purchased by the schools in the major leagues by<br />\nmeans of the higher salary offer after the man has put in many<br />\nyears \"seasoning\" in the ininors.<br />\nNot so at Hopkins. Pick 'em young, give your own boys<br />\na break, coach and play athletics for the sake of athletics\u2014<br />\nthat's how its done at Bluejayville. If some of the other<br />\nschools around the nation did this perhaps the purity code<br />\nwould be pure. If Army did this perhaps the record of the<br />\nBlack Knights of the Hudson would be a little less black. If<br />\nC.C.N.Y. did it perhaps the record of its basketball teams<br />\nwould mean more than odds on a bookie's blackboard.<br />\nSo to Joe Sollers goes the congratulations of the Hopkins<br />\ncampus and the wishes that he may see the old Indian game<br />\nspread acros the nation in big proportions before he hangs up his<br />\ncoaching hat.<br />\nNews from the rule makers: About the only significant<br />\nchange in this year's football rules is designed to benefit the<br />\noffense. How many times have ball clubs behind by a few<br />\npoints and only seconds remaining called time-out to save the<br />\nprecious seconds, only to have the gun sound before they could<br />\nget their play under way? This will be no more. Under the<br />\nold rule the official asked both captains if they were ready to<br />\nplay ball, if they both answered yes he stepped away from<br />\nthe ball and signaled the clock to start. Before the offense<br />\ncould get set, pass the ball back, and get their play in motion<br />\nthe time rang out. Under the new rules the teams line up, the<br />\ncaptains signify ready to play, but the time doesn't start until<br />\nthe ball is centered back.

ROBERTS<br />\nCollege students very often become too accustomed - to their<br />\nbuildings and campus. After a<br />\nnew class schedule has become<br />\nfamiliar routine, the physical surroundings are<br />\nalmost always<br />\nthought of in terms of that routine<br />\nand<br />\nits extra-curricular<br />\ndiversions. Generaly, school buildings adopt the form of those<br />\nplaces where classes or labs are<br />\nheld, while the campus receives<br />\neven less attention.<br />\nHere at Hopkins the same situation seems to exist. There are,<br />\non the Homewood campus, a little<br />\nless than twenty structures. Dur-<br /><br />\nmetrical whole\" by a donation of<br />\nmoney to defray the costs of working out preliminary plans. The<br />\nUniversity accepted the money<br />\nand advice; deliberately they<br />\nnoted the plan, or lack of such,<br />\nin other schools, measured the<br />\nneeds of the University's departments and sought the guidance of<br />\narchitects. In order to insure an<br />\nunbroken harmony of design, a<br />\npermanent<br />\nboard<br />\nof advisorarchitects :was established.<br />\nCarroll Mansion<br />\nSoon these men were judging<br />\nplans for the Homewood site development submitted in invitational competition. While much of<br /><br />\nthe qaestion of what to do with<br />\nbuildings already on campus. The<br />\nCarroll Mansion, its barn, the<br />\nWyman house, its gatehOuse and<br />\ncaretaker's home were treated by<br />\nthe University differently.<br />\nThe wisdom of sparing the<br />\nBarn becomes apparent when one<br />\nconsiders its over-all charm, from<br />\nthe little cupola to the arty gothicism of its west windows, and when<br />\none realizes how well it has<br />\nadapted itself to the curricular<br />\nand extra-curricular needs of the<br />\nUniversity. While the Wyman<br />\nestate's, caretaker's house has become the Student Clinic and the<br />\ngatehouse is a small laboratory,<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nIT CAN HAPPEN HERE<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\nThe case of the honor code violators at West Point caused<br />\nits impact of shock because the military academy had been so universally synonymous in people's minds with all that is honor and<br />\ncharacter in a gentleman. But never, when human beings are<br />\nconcerned, is there immunity to weakness.<br />\nIntellectual strength and strength of character were placed<br />\nside by side by Dr. Bronk in his address last Tuesday evening.<br />\nWith this merging of the two qualities, the educator spoke in the<br />\ntradition of higher learning generally and of our own university<br />\nin particular. \"The truth of God will make you free\" is a high<br />\nstandard, but the least possible standard.<br />\nThe freedom of truth\u2014the absurdity and futility of being<br />\nfalse to oneself\u2014is the basis for an honor system at the Hopkins.<br />\nIt is an ideal, a conception of things not as they always are but<br />\nas they should be. Despite the pedestal on which it is placed,<br />\nhonor is inseparable from Johns Hopkins and its purpose. Without<br />\nthis ideal our university would not be almost the same, nor nearly<br />\nperfect; it would be impossible.<br />\nFor the student who enters its doors this year, as well as for<br />\nthose who are already here, there will be temptations to cheat.<br />\nTo many of the newcomers the system, with its absence of proctoring, will bring amazement. But as the initial wonder wears off,<br />\nthe satisfaction that such freedom invokes will begin to take root.<br />\nIt is then that, at the merest though of yielding to any of the<br />\nalways-present temptations, the student must arm himself with<br />\nmilitant disgust.<br />\nTo make the system work every other part of the whole school<br />\nmust feel shocked and sad in the event of a violation. The honor<br />\nsystem is a massive but personal thing that depends on both the<br />\nunity . of the university and the strength of each individual.<br />\nWest Point dismissals come and public indignations go, and<br />\nit one fact remains adamant. The educated man withthrough<br />\nall<br />\nout character is in a complete sense uneducated, and useless both<br />\nto himself and to the world. The Hopkins student who violates<br />\nour honor code cheats, our whole university and all it stands for,<br />\ning<br />\nbut most devastatingly he cheats himself.<br /><br />\nNOT FAR ENOUGH<br />\nFirst to congratulate, then to criticize the Student Council<br />\non their first major undertaking of the school year.<br />\nFor many years the Freshmen coming to Hopkins were expected to choose their class leaders during the short space of the<br />\nOrientation Week proceedings.

The first of course was Fred Smith who stepped<br />\nright into the head laertibse duties last year. Both men were<br />\nall-Americans. Until the chill of winter conies to Baltimore<br />\nand while the snow lies over Homewood, Sollers will be taking<br />\na teacher training course at Hopkins. But as soon as spring<br />\ncomes around he'll he the man in charge of developing and<br />\nnourishing the seed of another Jay lacrosse generation.<br />\nThis 'Nester feels it's a very smart move on the part of the<br />\nathletic department to get the services of both Sollers and Fred<br />\nSmith. Lacrosse as a game has, certainly, plenty of room for<br />\nexpansion.<br />\nFor expansion this sport needs new men, young men, to<br />\ntake over coaching duties. The Hopkins policy appears to he<br />\n\"give the young graduates the chance of experience ..<br />\nand as long as there are schools such as Hopkins and men<br />\nsuch as these there need be no fear of a decline in the popu<br />\nlarity of lacrosse.<br />\nSollers began his stick playing at Boy's Latin here in Baltimore. in his final year there he was named All-Maryland goalie.<br />\nThen followed three straight years as the guardian of the Hopkins<br />\ncage. In his junior year he was named second-string all-American<br />\nand, although the all-American rating for last season won't be<br />\nout for a about a month, Joe is a prohibative favorite to get a firststring berth.<br />\nThus Joe has the inside track for the honor of being the<br />\nyoungest Hopkins coach. Fred Smith is a hardy vet of a<br />\nyear's experience, Frank Burns is a comparative elder being<br />\ntwo years out of college, Carl Rees is two years out of Springfield, and Mac Erwin shed the old school tie of Davidson just<br />\ntwo years ago.<br />\nWith all these youlig coaches sharing the Ifopkins duties,<br />\nmention might be made of the fact that once again the \",Lily<br />\nWhite\" policy shows itself in its full light. Pick up any sports<br />\npage of a downto'Tm newspaper and you'll find a story of some<br />\nbig name coach getting an offer from sonic other school or of some<br />\nschool with a luminous athletic reputation looking over the prospects of geting some ranking coach. These coaches are bought<br />\nby higher salary offers, just as these schools buy 'ball players.<br />\nAlthough vigorous denials will always be made, tuitions are paid,<br />\na high paying job arranged for which entails very little work<br />\nif any at all, and arrangements are made to keep the boys in<br />\nschool despite poor grades. Thus ball players are purchased.<br />\nCoaches are purchased by the schools in the major leagues by<br />\nmeans of the higher salary offer after the man has put in many<br />\nyears \"seasoning\" in the ininors.<br />\nNot so at Hopkins.

If<br />\nC.C.N.Y. did it perhaps the record of its basketball teams<br />\nwould mean more than odds on a bookie's blackboard.<br />\nSo to Joe Sollers goes the congratulations of the Hopkins<br />\ncampus and the wishes that he may see the old Indian game<br />\nspread acros the nation in big proportions before he hangs up his<br />\ncoaching hat.<br />\nNews from the rule makers: About the only significant<br />\nchange in this year's football rules is designed to benefit the<br />\noffense. How many times have ball clubs behind by a few<br />\npoints and only seconds remaining called time-out to save the<br />\nprecious seconds, only to have the gun sound before they could<br />\nget their play under way? This will be no more. Under the<br />\nold rule the official asked both captains if they were ready to<br />\nplay ball, if they both answered yes he stepped away from<br />\nthe ball and signaled the clock to start. Before the offense<br />\ncould get set, pass the ball back, and get their play in motion<br />\nthe time rang out. Under the new rules the teams line up, the<br />\ncaptains signify ready to play, but the time doesn't start until<br />\nthe ball is centered back.
