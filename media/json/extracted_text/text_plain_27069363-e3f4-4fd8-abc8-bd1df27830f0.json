I was inside the armory during the entire<br />\nfracas and I saw freshmen<br />\nneither using their fists nor<br />\nwielding weapons of any sort<br />\nduring any part of the affair. That<br />\nthe conduct of the policemen is<br />\nunjustifiable is admitted by everyone, but to say that the freshmen held their \"schooimates\"<br />\nwhile the police brutally clubbed<br />\nthem is erroneous. There was<br />\nperhaps one case where a sophomore was held when a policeman<br />\nhit him, that is, John Turnbull's,<br />\nan occurrence which is deplored<br />\nby the entire freshman class. The<br />\nFreshmen who were holding him<br />\nwere doing so in order to prevent<br />\nhim from overturning tables, not<br />\nfor the benefit of the police.<br />\nAs to the freshmen breaking a<br />\ntradition in not inviting the sophomores into the banquet, I refer<br />\nyou to the issue of the News-Letter dated March 25, in which the<br />\nPresident of the freshman class<br />\nis quoted as having told the Sophomores gathered outside the<br />\narmory \"to return in an hour and<br />\nview the entertainment which will<br />\nfollow the meal.\"<br />\nThis I feel<br />\ncovers the question as to our<br />\nbreaking that tradition.<br />\nTo say that the freshmen could<br />\nhave prevented the property damage if they had so desired is both<br />\nstupid and ridiculous. Does any<br />\none think that we broke eighteen<br />\nwindows merely for the pleasure<br />\nof paying for them?<br />\nPerhaps Milton Medenbach<br />\nwas writing from hearsay or<br />\nnewspaper accounts, if that is the<br />\ncase, I should like to remind him<br />\nthat there is a great deal in the<br />\nsaying \"seeing is believing.\"<br />\n'The letter I have made past<br />\nreference to ends with a question:<br />\n\"is the freshman class worthy<br /><br />\nSANDS WINS ADAMS MEDAL Phone,CAl. 1380<br />\nHome\u2014HO. 2095-J<br />\nFRANCES T.
