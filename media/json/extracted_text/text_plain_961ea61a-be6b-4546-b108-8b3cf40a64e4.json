We refer to Special<br />\nOfficer number 650, assigned to the<br />\nHopkins beat, and better known in<br />\nCollege circles as the Campus Cop.<br />\nThe word personality was used<br />\nadvisedly. Officer 650 is a personality, but his inherent modesty and<br />\nshyness have prevented any flaunting of his virtues. In fact the<br />\nhardest part of an interview with<br />\nhim was to keep him from expounding eulogies on the ability of Hopkins men to get in and 0!1t of jams<br />\n(traffic) and get him to talk about<br />\nhimself. After being repeatedly<br />\nassured that being mentioned in the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER would not ruin an<br />\notherwise unsullied reputation, the<br />\nfollowing bit of biography was revealed.<br />\n<br />\nOf<br />\n<br />\nMr. Robert Andrew Mueller, or<br />\n\"Bob\" for short. The Mueller, he<br />\nassures us, no matter how you pronounce it, is Irish, and it goes without saying that the shamrock is<br />\nBob's favorite flower. He is married, has two children, and has been<br />\na resident of the fair city of Baltimore all his life. His favorite<br />\npastime is playing auto - license<br />\npoker with himself, and it is thus<br />\nthat he whiles away the time while<br />\non duty.

Such a blending<br />\nof qualities, as rare as beneficent<br />\nand delightful, must leave a lasting<br />\nimpression not measured by immediate contacts alone.<br />\nDoubtless it is a fault of an educational community like our own<br />\nthat we do not possess better facilities for the expression of sympathy:<br />\nbut at least Dr. Ames must know<br />\nthat every member of the University is aware of what he has suffered, and is grateful for the way<br />\nhe has borne this suffering, and still<br />\ncontinued to labor for our common<br />\ngood.

Officer 650 is a personality, but his inherent modesty and<br />\nshyness have prevented any flaunting of his virtues. In fact the<br />\nhardest part of an interview with<br />\nhim was to keep him from expounding eulogies on the ability of Hopkins men to get in and 0!1t of jams<br />\n(traffic) and get him to talk about<br />\nhimself.

Yet such was the unique<br />\nquality of her personality, and such<br />\nis the particular loss to Dr. Ames,<br />\nthat the life of all is in a true if<br />\nnot immediate sense so touched.<br />\nThose who had in the past been<br />\nso fortunate as to enjoy a closer<br />\nintimacy with Mrs. Ames. can declare how unique that personality<br />\nwas, for it combined keen wit,<br />\ndownright honesty, dauutless courage, and unfailing kindness, all of<br />\nthese with a fineness of breeding<br />\nand an individual charm which was<br />\nentirely her own. Such a blending<br />\nof qualities, as rare as beneficent<br />\nand delightful, must leave a lasting<br />\nimpression not measured by immediate contacts alone.<br />\nDoubtless it is a fault of an educational community like our own<br />\nthat we do not possess better facilities for the expression of sympathy:<br />\nbut at least Dr. Ames must know<br />\nthat every member of the University is aware of what he has suffered, and is grateful for the way<br />\nhe has borne this suffering, and still<br />\ncontinued to labor for our common<br />\ngood.

It is the<br />\nundergraduates who would be benefited-and, to the loyal Hopkins<br />\nman, the slight inconvenience<br />\ncaused by an earlier rising should<br />\ncount as nothing against the aid<br />\nto the teams which could so be<br />\nrendered. To the members of the<br />\nfaculty, however, whose interest in<br />\nathletics, by the nature of things<br />\ncan never be quite such a personal<br />\none, earlier classes might very conceivably be highly distasteful. If<br />\nthey can be prevailed upon to take<br />\nthe step, it will be the most concrete evidence of their strong sympathy with the undergraduates<br />\nthat they could render.<br />\nThe question, of course, resolves<br />\nitself into how to have the provision for earlier classes passed.<br /><br />\nMade of the finest tobaccos -The<br />\nCream of many Crops- LUCKY STRIKE<br />\nalone offers the throat protection of the<br />\nexclusive 11TOASTING 11 Process which includes the use of modern Ultra Violet Rays<br />\n- the process that expels certain harsh,<br />\nbiting irritants naturally present in every<br />\ntobacco leaf.
