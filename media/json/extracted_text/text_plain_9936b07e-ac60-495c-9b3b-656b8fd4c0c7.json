If<br />\nthe Office has been successful, and<br />\nmeaningful changes have been<br />\nmade in student services, it is due<br />\nin very large measure to the efforts<br />\nof the students themselves.

Fitzpatrick<br />\nDean of Students<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have noticed in recent issues of<br />\nthe News-Letter occasional letters<br />\nor columns, usually written by seniors or grad students, which dolefully lament the passing of those<br />\nnostaligic days of student demonstrations, political activism, radical<br />\nyouth movements, and increased<br />\nstudent social consciousness. Also,<br />\nif Dick Oles' annual prediction<br />\ncomes true, the \"leftists will be<br />\ncrawling out of the woodwork\"<br />\nthis Spring, and there will probably<br />\nbe other outcries against the purportedly \"unjust\" acts occurring<br />\nthroughout the world. The military<br />\n- as more or less an \"autonomous<br />\nentity\" - naturally gets its share of<br />\nthese verbal darts.

It is their job. The<br />\nprevailing administrative version of<br />\nthis is that they are giving other<br />\ngroups on campus a break, relieving them from the burden of decision making so that they are free<br />\n<br />\n4.1\"<br />\n,<br />\n\"'<br />\n<br />\nenough.- This is true, but it is due<br />\n<br />\nto the hoarding of information by<br />\nthe Administration. An example of<br />\nthis is the recent controversy over<br />\nthe \"blue book,\" the detailed University operating budget. The<br />\nadministration was reluctant<br />\n(unwilling) to give the budget to<br />\nthe Student Council. The fact of<br />\nthe matter is that there really was<br />\nno useful informatiOn in this budget and the Administration knew<br />\nthis. Their reluctance to give out<br />\nthe book was not due to a fear of<br />\nwhat was in it, rather, it was a well<br />\npracticed reaction to the credo that<br />\ninformation is not to be parted<br />\nwith lightly.

The administration is ,a group of professional<br />\ndecision makers. As such, most of<br />\ntheir time and resources are spent<br />\nin making decisions. They have<br />\nmore of the commodities (time<br />\nand resources) than any other<br />\ngroup on campus. This gives them<br />\nanother advantage, namely: superior organization. The administration is no smarter than the faculty or the students, but they always seem to present slightly better arguments to support their<br />\npositions. This is because they are<br />\nable to research each topic more<br />\nthoroughly than the other groups<br />\n(and also have an informational<br />\n-monopoly). Of course, the underlying factor behind all of this is<br />\nmoney. When it comes to making<br />\ndecisions, faculty and students are<br />\nnothing more than part-time volunteers with little or no staff.

The Jays<br />\nbeat Eckard 87-85 and defeated<br />\nthe Mules 67-62. These games<br />\ncontinued the ulcer-rendering<br />\nractice which this year's quintet<br />\nlias developed, winning or losing<br />\nmost games by five points or less.<br />\nThe Jays started out slowly<br />\nagainst Eckard, looking drained<br />\nfrom the previous night's contest<br />\nagainst archrival Loyola.<br />\nThe Floridians<br />\nshot a scorching 59% from the<br />\nfield in the first half and took a<br />\n50-45 lead into the locker room<br />\nat the half.<br />\n\"Normally if we hold out opponents to less than 36 points<br />\nper half we feel we've played<br />\ngood defense,\" commented<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert. \"But against<br />\nEckard we saw that most of their<br />\nshots were long-range jumpers<br />\nand there's no way you can defend against a team hitting 59%<br />\nfrom out there.\"<br />\nThe Jays started out the second half slowly also, and trailed<br />\nby 14 points with 10 minutes remaining before they started to<br />\nput their game together. Hopkins<br />\nstormed back in those final 10<br />\nminutes paced by the hotshooting of guard Paul Spence.<br />\n<br />\nSpence broke out of a severe<br />\nshooting slump to hit 9 of 16<br />\nshots and 24 points.

Going<br />\ninto that game the Blue Jays held<br />\nan 8-5 advantage, including two<br />\nwins last year. The Mules came<br />\ninto the game with a misleading<br />\n2-7 record, considering their losses have been to such teams as<br />\nPenn State and Navy. The<br />\nPennsylvanians conference record<br />\nstood untarnished at 2-0 until<br />\nSaturday night.<br />\nThe Mules starting lineup included four returning veterans to<br />\noppose Coach Rupert's shuffled<br />\nlineup of Fender, Greg DeLong,<br />\nOscar Schreiber, Paul Spence and<br />\nRandy Lovalio.<br />\nDespite the presence of a<br />\nmasked man in the Mules starting<br />\nfive (to protect a broken nose)<br />\nthe Homewood quintet started<br />\nout playing well and led the<br />\nclosely-contested game for the<br />\nfirst 17 minutes of the first half.<br />\nHowever, in the last four minutes<br />\nMuhlenberg outscored Hopkins.<br />\n12-6, knotting the score at 29<br />\nwith three minutes left and taking a 35-31 lead at halftime.<br />\nThe Jays cut the lead to two,<br />\n41-39, with 15:03 left in the<br />\n<br />\ngame but in the next five minutes, the Mules got hot and really<br />\nstarted kicking.

Suskind explained that the<br />\nprogram is \"more for students<br />\ninterested in what they have to<br />\noffer, whose programs can fit in.<br />\nThe primary purpose is not to<br />\nspend a year touring Europe.\"<br />\nSince the Center functions as a<br />\ngraduate institution, the program<br />\nwill be limited to upper level<br />\nundergraduates, particularly<br />\nthose in their junior year.<br />\nPrograms in other areas such as<br />\nhistory of art and history of science may be developed in the<br />\nfuture on an ad hoc basis. \"This<br />\nis an experimental program,small<br />\nto start; if it expands, it will have<br />\nto be with the general agreement<br />\nof Bologna and the Division of<br />\nt Arts and Sciences,\" stated<br />\nSuskind.<br />\nA total of six to twelve students will be accepted for the program.

This occurs either in<br />\nwriting (B.O.T.) or because of protocol(A.C.)<br />\n21 They listen for political reasons (Student Council, Academic<br />\nCeAme.:M.<br /><br />\naebatixw,WaNie a\\\\ k\\ie\u2022 cack%<br />\n\\<br /><br />\n64e.r.,\" Z7r-c-<br /><br />\nKeynesian view, i.e. employees). In<br />\nthe order I will discuss them they<br />\nare: Administration, Faculty,<br />\nGraduate students and undergraduates.<br />\nMost people believe that the Administration has most of the power<br />\non this campus. It is true that<br />\nthey make most of the important<br />\ndecisions. In most cases they are<br />\nnot overly enthusiastic about soliciting advice from groups that will<br />\nbe affected by these decisions. In<br />\nfact, there are only three factors<br /><br />\nthe Editor:<br />\nI did not want to leave Hopkins<br />\nwithout saying a strong thank you<br />\nto the many students whose help,<br />\nsupport and friendship I've enjoyed during the last three years. If<br />\nthe Office has been successful, and<br />\nmeaningful changes have been<br />\nmade in student services, it is due<br />\nin very large measure to the efforts<br />\nof the students themselves. I have<br />\nbeen extraordinarily impressed by<br />\nhow much students care and how<br />\nhard they are willing to work for<br />\nthe benefit of others.<br />\nThank you for three extraordinarily happy and exciting<br />\nyears.<br />\nRobert J. Fitzpatrick<br />\nDean of Students<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have noticed in recent issues of<br />\nthe News-Letter occasional letters<br />\nor columns, usually written by seniors or grad students, which dolefully lament the passing of those<br />\nnostaligic days of student demonstrations, political activism, radical<br />\nyouth movements, and increased<br />\nstudent social consciousness. Also,<br />\nif Dick Oles' annual prediction<br />\ncomes true, the \"leftists will be<br />\ncrawling out of the woodwork\"<br />\nthis Spring, and there will probably<br />\nbe other outcries against the purportedly \"unjust\" acts occurring<br />\nthroughout the world. The military<br />\n- as more or less an \"autonomous<br />\nentity\" - naturally gets its share of<br />\nthese verbal darts. Well, everyone,<br />\ndo your own thing....<br />\nAs I expect to depart this university during the summer, after<br />\nhaving spent four interesting years<br />\nhere as a grad student and ROTC<br /><br />\nkklekx<br /><br />\nvs.<br /><br />\ncfc...u,s,<br /><br />\n\"\"<br />\nrh,<br /><br />\n.Rcasorzs<br /><br />\nThere are many reasons which<br />\nexplain why the administration<br />\nmakes most of the decisions here.<br />\nThe major ones are:<br />\n1) Their attitude and the attitude of the rest of the University is<br />\nthat the Administration is paid to<br />\nmake decisions. It is their job. The<br />\nprevailing administrative version of<br />\nthis is that they are giving other<br />\ngroups on campus a break, relieving them from the burden of decision making so that they are free<br /><br />\n4.1\"<br />\n,<br />\n\"'<br /><br />\nenough.- This is true, but it is due<br /><br />\nto the hoarding of information by<br />\nthe Administration. An example of<br />\nthis is the recent controversy over<br />\nthe \"blue book,\" the detailed University operating budget. The<br />\nadministration was reluctant<br />\n(unwilling) to give the budget to<br />\nthe Student Council. The fact of<br />\nthe matter is that there really was<br />\nno useful informatiOn in this budget and the Administration knew<br />\nthis. Their reluctance to give out<br />\nthe book was not due to a fear of<br />\nwhat was in it, rather, it was a well<br />\npracticed reaction to the credo that<br />\ninformation is not to be parted<br />\nwith lightly. An \"information gap\"<br />\nexists between the Administration<br />\nand other groups on campus. This<br />\ninstructor, I would like in passing disparity gives the Administration<br />\nquote the following observa- a tremendous (and unbeatable)<br />\nto<br />\ntion of a British sociologist, Philip edge in decision making.<br />\nAbrams, and to dedicate it to<br />\n3) Speed of action is another<br />\nwhatever is left of radical student reason why the administration<br />\nactivism: (underlines are mine).<br />\nmakes the majority- of decisions at<br />\n\"Alienation...is a condition Johns Hopkins.

The [military] services<br />\nthus find themselves in the position of being a socially necessary<br />\ninstitution of which the distinctive<br />\nvalues are socially derogated.\"<br />\n(Quoted in William L. Hauser,<br />\nAmerica's Army in ('risis: A Study<br />\nin Civil-Military Relations, The<br />\nJohns Hopkins Univ.

This- is a very<br />\nimportant and not very well understood tactic. It's not easy to argue<br />\na point when the people you are<br /><br />\nRobert L.

He said all the things<br />\nthat he wasn't supposed to say, all<br />\nthe things nobody ever seems to remember. He finished his speech by<br />\nshouting, \"The machine must<br />\nfall!\" I don't think he really meant<br />\nit, though. He just said it because<br />\nhe wasn't supposed to, because his<br />\nsaying it would cause all the fine,<br />\nupstanding citizens of Washington<br />\nto piss in their pants. \u2022<br />\nSo Larry came to Hopkins. For<br />\na couple of months he played the<br />\nthroat role to the hilt.

First move he made was<br />\nto head for the newly-finished<br />\nRathskellar. But the Rat wasn't his<br />\nplace, so he stopped going there,<br />\nexcept once a week to play bridge.<br />\nHe went back to the Snack Bar,<br />\nand found that the old group was<br />\ngone.

Of course, his decision is subject to the approval of<br />\n\"higher-ups,\" but they work with<br />\nthe same lightning speed. As a result of this facility to decide,<br />\npeople who are looking for important decisions will tend to go to the<br />\nadministration first. They can get a<br />\nouick decision. which if satisfying,<br />\nft11<br />\nsolves the problem.

The administration is ,a group of professional<br />\ndecision makers. As such, most of<br />\ntheir time and resources are spent<br />\nin making decisions. They have<br />\nmore of the commodities (time<br />\nand resources) than any other<br />\ngroup on campus. This gives them<br />\nanother advantage, namely: superior organization. The administration is no smarter than the faculty or the students, but they always seem to present slightly better arguments to support their<br />\npositions. This is because they are<br />\nable to research each topic more<br />\nthoroughly than the other groups<br />\n(and also have an informational<br />\n-monopoly). Of course, the underlying factor behind all of this is<br />\nmoney. When it comes to making<br />\ndecisions, faculty and students are<br />\nnothing more than part-time volunteers with little or no staff. It is the<br />\ndollar which makes the administrative wheels go round.<br />\nWith all of these advantages<br />\nhowever, faculty and students still<br />\nmanage to get into the act. Their<br />\ninput comes in many different<br />\nforms, depending on the intensity<br />\nof the issue and the circumstances<br />\ninvolved.<br /><br />\nmT<br /><br />\nailStVer.<br /><br />\nI a 77<br /><br />\nsure than every one of my classmates has a different one.

The General<br />\nFunds revenues include endowment income, temporary investment pool income, tuition and<br />\nfees, and Maryland State aid.<br />\nAll of these areas, as well as<br />\nthe Sponsored Research Budget,<br />\nShowed an increase in fiscal year<br />\n1975. While some increase is envisioned for 1976, Muller has<br />\nstated flatly, \"There are no new<br />\ngrounds for optimism on the revenue side [for fiscal year 19761.On the cost side, with respect<br />\nto allocations which are made for<br />\na given fiscal year within the<br />\nliomewOod Division, the Vice<br />\nPresident, has, in most instances,.<br />\n!he final say concerning priorities, Krueger said.<br />\nUsing preparations for fiscal<br />\nYear 1976 as an example, budget<br />\ngaideline5 and worksheets were<br />\n'landed to offices and departments with the university administration in October. On November 1. initial estimates of univer-<br /><br />\nsity-wide revenues- were distributed to the divisions. With reference to this stage of the process<br />\nat Homewood, Krueger. said,<br />\n\"Here Benton is given his piece<br />\nof the action.Zero Budget Policy<br />\n.<br />\nFor liscal year' 1976, a zero<br />\nbudgetary policy has been implemented in all administrative<br />\noffices throughout the University. All cost outlays will be ex7<br />\nmined on an individual basis,<br />\nstarting from an allocation of<br />\nzero dollars.<br />\nThrough a . series of meetings<br />\nbetween such parties as the Vice<br />\nPresident and administrative and<br />\ndepartmentai heads., allocation figures for ,the individual departments and offices at Homewood<br />\nare reached. Acting on prior<br />\nknowledge of the projected total<br />\nrevebues, division heads know,<br />\nwithin an estimable range, what<br /><br />\ntheir total expenditure figetre<br />\nshould resemble.

Krueger offered, \"Larry Denton 1Director<br />\nof Academic Service's\" won't<br />\ncome in with a budget which is<br />\nS100,000 over.Spending priorities are set up<br />\nthroughout the budgetary profess at Homewood by Benton's<br />\n'Office. Apparently, a great deal<br />\nof knowledge is required to arrive<br />\nat final dollar appreations for the<br />\nindividual departments and offices, based on the priorities set<br />\nup between the office .of the Vice<br />\nPresident and the departmental<br />\nand office heads. Benton stated<br />\nthat it is because or this that he<br />\nhas seen fit to preclua accessio<br />\ndepartmental and office budgets<br />\nby such groups as the Student<br />\nBudgetary Advisory Committee.<br />\nIn Benton's words, \"There is no<br />\nway on God's green earth that a<br /><br />\nstudent group can<br />\nwhether or .not dollar appropriations are valid.''<br />\nThe university President does<br />\nhave input into . priorities at<br />\nlomewood \u2022 and other divisiOns.<br />\nFor example, Krueger stated that<br />\nfor fiscal year 1976 President<br />\nMuller has requested more adequate funding for the<br />\nEisenhower Library. an increase<br />\nin student aid, and has appointed<br />\na committee including Homewood Professors Owen Phillips<br />\nand Carl Christ to e\\amine the<br />\nUniversity budget.<br />\nOnce initial projections for divisional budgets'are made. they.<br />\nare sent to Krueger's office in<br />\nmid-November.

The Jays<br />\nbeat Eckard 87-85 and defeated<br />\nthe Mules 67-62.

Hopkins<br />\nstormed back in those final 10<br />\nminutes paced by the hotshooting of guard Paul Spence.<br /><br />\nSpence broke out of a severe<br />\nshooting slump to hit 9 of 16<br />\nshots and 24 points.

The Mules came<br />\ninto the game with a misleading<br />\n2-7 record, considering their losses have been to such teams as<br />\nPenn State and Navy.
