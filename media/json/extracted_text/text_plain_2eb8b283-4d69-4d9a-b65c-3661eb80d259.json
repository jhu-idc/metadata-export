Den. Hey... we know that comments on the antiIranian graffiti would make for juicier copy, but the<br />\nCouncil really outdid themselves this Wednesday, and we<br />\nfeel that they deserve as many column inches as any other<br />\nmajor disaster on campus.<br />\nIf you have been paying attention at all this year, then<br />\nyou know that the Council and the SAC have been using<br />\nthe buzz-phrase \"discusion of personalities\" as an excuse<br />\nto cover-up anything which they feel is too embarrasing<br />\nto inform the students about. Well, this week they .clecided to come out of the closet, and the result was so<br />\nridiculous that it almost makes us wish they'd return to<br />\ntheir clandestine habits.<br />\nApparently, Tom Messana spent the better part of<br />\nWednesday night's four-and-a-half hour bffe-a-thcn, explaining to an irrate Boss Connolly how the News-Letter<br />\nviciously libeled him. We make no claim of infallibility,<br />\nbut we must point out that Mr. Messana read the offending<br />\narticle before it went to press and declared it fit to print.<br />\nAh well, hindsight is 20-20-- especially when Big George is<br />\nbreathing down your neck... right, Tom?<br />\nMessana's \"change of heart\" is really small spuds<br />\ncompared to the center ring performances, though. When<br />\nKarl \"it's-closed-because-it's-not-open\" Block winds up<br />\ndefending freedom of information on this campus, then<br />\nhis antagonist must surely be a censor of the first water.<br />\nEnter Sid Goodfriend...staunch defender of the Council's<br />\nGod-given right to squander our money in secrecy. Sid was<br />\nmuch concerned about whether Council members have<br />\nan \"automatic\" responsibility to thrash things out amongst<br />\nthemselves, instead of bothering the News-Letter and<br />\nthe students with all those tedious facts about the Council's inability to engage in any activity besides bickering.<br />\nSid the Silent may be right...but if so, we also contend that<br />\nthe News-Letter has an \"automatic\" responsibility to bring<br />\nthe pointless blatherings of the Council to light, and that<br />\nthe students have an equally automatic right to<br />\nthrow<br />\ntheir<br />\nearliest<br />\npossible<br />\nout<br />\nat<br />\nofoffice<br />\nsuch nironic WWWV1/46<br />\nconvenience.<br />\nConno117 confidant Robert Elkin, evidently uninformed about the Council's nearly month-old status as a pitiful<br />\ncollection of battling egos, expressed the hope that its<br />\nparliamentary masturbation wouldn't \"develop into a<br />\ncharade and a lot of silliness.\" Gee, we hope not, too, Bob.<br />\nThe sad fact of the matter is that the Student Council has<br />\nindeed ceased to provide any meaningful service to the<br />\nstudent body. What began as a promising year has quickly<br />\ndegenerated into a desperate fight among the various petty<br />\npoliticos to save face amidst an orgy of backstabbing and<br />\npersonal conflict.<br />\nGeorge Connolly, a man who possesses a realistic grasp<br />\nof just what the Student Council can and cannot do to<br />\naffect Administration policy, had some excellent ideas at<br />\nthe semester's beginning for furthering student interests.<br />\n(In case you've forgotten, that is the purpose of the<br />\nCouncil.) Unfortunately, it is not at all clear, at this point,<br />\nwhether George has himself escaped the general malaise<br />\nwhich has afflicted his fellow members. And even if<br />\nhe still has his wits fully about him, what member of the<br />\nAdministration is going to take the Council's suggestions<br />\nseriously now?<br />\n<br />\nProblem<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to comment of<br />\nMr. Alex Kodat's (pinhead)<br />\narticle of Nov. 9. I had reservations about writing these cornments, thinking that they might<br />\nbe considered too vitriolic for a<br />\nuniversity newsletter. Having<br />\nseen such editorials as \"Enough<br />\nCrap!\" and \"Access Sucks\",<br />\nhowever, I have suppressed my<br />\nqualms and sent this anyway.<br />\nIn the first place, Voltaire,<br />\nwho certainly suffered enough in<br />\nhis lifetime, is being badgered by<br />\nnonexistent quotations. To wit,<br />\nhe never said, \"I may disagree<br />\nwith what you say, but I will<br />\ndefend to the death your right<br />\nto say it\" This is a Voltaire<br />\nparaphrase by S.G. Tallentyre,<br />\nwhose works are not usually<br />\nfound in quotation compedia.<br />\nDisagreeeing with Mr. Pin-head over details, however, does<br />\nnot mean that I believe in<br />\nwanton destruction of posters.<br />\nOn the contrary, I will defend to<br />\nthe death an individual's right to<br />\ndeface our buildings. After all,<br />\nposters fulfill a very necessary<br />\npurpose at Hopkins - they save<br />\nmoney on wallpaper.<br />\nIn a serious vein, however,<br />\nhave three comments to make:<br />\na) the editorial writer ought, in<br />\nthe future, to send his advertisements through the mailboxes in<br />\nthe New Dorms, b) a newsletter<br />\nwhich normally deals with such<br />\nissues as rent control, campus<br />\nsecurity, and consumer protection is not the place to complain<br />\nabout missing placards, and c)<br />\nthe posters were probably blown<br />\naway.<br />\nDavid Drewer<br />\nHey, Dave. What you have<br />\njust written is commonly referred to as a Letter To The Editor.<br />\nIt is not an Editorial. The<br />\nEditorial is the natty item to the<br />\nimmediate left of this response<br />\nby the Editor. Is your confusion<br />\nnow at an end? Good.<br />\n--C.B.<br />\n<br />\nAmerica!!<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nWhat the hell has happened<br />\nto the United States? Since<br />\nWorld War II the United States,<br />\nonce undefeated in war, has<br />\ngotten fat. In Korea we acceded<br />\nto a tie. In Vietnam we lost.<br />\nNow we arc getting pushed<br />\naround by a bunch of goddamn<br />\nArabs and Moslem holy men.<br />\nThe United States has simply<br />\nbecoMe afraid of its own power,<br />\n<br />\nas well as too damn noble and<br />\ngoodie-twoshoes to resort to a<br />\nlittle muscle flexing to get its<br />\nway.<br />\nThe American revolution of<br />\ntwo hundred years ago showed<br />\nAmerica to .the world as the<br />\nmighty underdog capable of<br />\nbeating none other than the<br />\nBritish Empire. Shortly thereafter we defended this hardfought<br />\nfor revolution against the still<br />\npowerful British. Our respect<br />\nthroughout the world heightened as the mighty Eagle returned to tend its own nest for<br />\nyears. When provoked by the<br />\ndestruction of the Maine, Teddy<br />\nRoosevelt led the Rough Riders<br />\nto a stunning victory against the<br />\nSpanish. Both World Wars can<br />\nmark as their turning points<br />\nthe U.S. entry into battle. Black<br />\nJack Pershing led a group of<br />\nun-combattrained Amercans into<br />\nthe First World War and turned<br />\nback the devastating German<br />\nArmy. And in World War II<br />\nnone other than Patton, MacArthur, Eisehnower and many<br />\nothers led a well tuned American<br />\nfighting machine that staged<br />\nsuccessful war on two fronts.<br />\nHowever, the war in the<br />\nPacific was won using two atom<br />\nbombs. The destruction unleashed caused America to look<br />\ntwice at its role as the saviour of<br />\ndemocracy. When the Russians<br />\ngot their hands on the bomb<br />\nsuddenly Americans decided it<br />\nwas time to play school marm to<br />\nthe rest of the world rather than<br />\nthe jail warden image once<br />\nconveyed.<br />\nSince 1945 the<br />\nworld's attitude has shifted from<br />\nadmiration and respect to jibes<br />\nFrom rolling<br />\nand ridicule.<br />\nover the Hun in W.W.II we have<br />\ncome to speechifying the enemy<br />\nas our main means of attack.<br />\nOur tie in Korea and loss in<br />\nVietnam has pointed out that<br />\nthe United States is gullible and<br />\nvulnerable.<br />\nThe attitude is<br />\nshared by many Americans.<br />\nWhen Barry Goldwater was<br />\nlabeled as an A-bomb tosser he<br />\nwas thoroughly throttled in his<br />\nattempt to become president<br />\nand ridiculed throughout the<br />\nland as warmonger. All I can say<br />\nabout L.B.J. is we got what<br />\nwe voted for.<br />\nIsrael is an excellent example of what America once was<br />\nand still should be. The Israeli<br />\nArmy has repeatedly done the<br />\nremarkable and considerable<br />\ntask of defending their little<br />\nswatch of land from villainous,<br />\nhateful enemies on all sides.<br />\nTheir faith in their own power is<br />\nso considerable they feel safe in<br />\nreturning some of their captured<br />\nterritories. Several times since<br />\nIsrael's existence have they repelled attackers and drove them<br />\ndeep into their own land. In<br />\naddition Israeli commandoes re-<br />\n<br />\ncorded one of the most daring<br />\nand precise raids ever in rescuing<br />\ntheir people at the Entebbe<br />\nAirport.<br />\nOn the other hand America<br />\nand the rest of the Western<br />\nWorld sit on their asses as OPEC<br />\nhikes oil prices to such levels<br />\nthat many Americans have to<br />\nface the decision: heat or eat.<br />\nNow the incident of Iranian<br />\nstudents holding Americans hostage further reflects the attitude<br />\nof a fat, ineffectual America.<br />\nWe must repulse the Ayatollah<br />\nand now make him suffer for his<br />\nsins.<br />\nWe can no longer<br />\nignore him.

If we have to<br />\nbomb the living daylights we<br />\nshould do it. It we have to<br />\nestablish a blockade against<br />\nthem and starve them to submission we should. If we have to<br />\nround up all the Iranian students<br />\nand revert to the Old Testament dictate \"a tooth for a<br />\ntooth, an eye for an eye,- then<br />\nlet it be.

BLUMENTHAL<br />\nDr. Norman Anderson has<br />\nrecently assumed the position of<br />\nDirector of Admissions at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical School.<br />\nAfter graduation from the University of Montana, Dr. Anderson attended Washington University Medical School in St.<br />\nLouis. Subsequently, he served<br />\non the staff of the Johns Hopkins Hospital as intern, resident<br />\nand chief resident in medicine.<br />\nDuring three years of additional<br />\ntraining at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania, D. Anderson was<br />\nengaged in laboratory investigaHe returned to Johns<br />\ntion.<br />\nHopkins to pursue a career<br />\nin teaching, clinical care of<br />\npatients and medical research.<br />\nQ. How does Hopkins regard women applicants? Does<br />\nthe medical school consider<br />\nthem a special interest group?<br />\nA. Hopkins has had a major<br />\ncommittment to train women as<br />\nmedical students for many years.<br />\nOne problem recently has been<br />\nthe concern that women applicants have had about the geographical surroundings of the<br />\nmedical institutions. The social-economic environment has<br />\nmade it difficult to get many<br />\nwomen to train at Hopkins. We<br />\nhave tried to remedy this situation.<br />\nQ. Dr. Muller has stated that<br />\nthe applicants to Hopkins reflect<br />\nthe applicant pool in terms of<br />\nwomen, men and minorities.<br />\nDoes this statement apply to<br />\nmedical school admission policies?<br />\nA. We have no precise goals<br />\nor guidelines: every application<br />\nis considered on an individual<br />\nbasis. The committee makes ,a<br />\nstrong effort to seek out excellence and outstanding future<br />\npotential. This is the prime<br />\nconsideration. Everything else is<br />\nsecondary to this effort.<br />\nQ. Dr. Anderson, is it your<br />\nresponsibility to make a preliminary review ofall the applicants<br />\nor is this evaluation parceled out<br />\nto members of the committee?<br />\nA. Normally the preliminary<br />\nreview of applicants is divided<br />\nup by members of the committee. At present, However, I am<br />\nmaking an effort to evaluate all<br />\nof the applications so that I<br />\nmight obtain some appraisal of<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nvarious<br />\nthe<br />\nschools in this country. In the<br />\nfuture much of this work will be<br />\nperformed by members of the<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nQ. Last year there were several<br />\narticles in the News-Letter<br />\nconcerning the admission of<br />\nto<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nHopkins<br />\nHopkins medical school. Some<br />\nof the students on the Homewood campus felt that they were<br />\nreceiving less consideration than<br />\nstudents at other schools. Was<br />\nthere any reason why Hopkins<br />\nmedical school appeared to<br />\ndiscriminate against Hopkilts<br />\nundergraduates?<br />\nA. In most universities the<br />\nmedical schools usually admit<br />\nthe largest proportion of students from their affiliated undergraduate school. Last yeat<br />\ntwo particular medical schools<br />\n<br />\ndid not follow this policy. They<br />\nwere Yale and Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIf one reviews admissions records for the past decade, one<br />\nwill observe that Hopkins Medical School usually followed the<br />\npractice of most other medical<br />\nschools.<br />\nI believe that the admissions<br />\ncommittee tries to compare<br />\nstudents from Hopkins with<br />\nthose from other schools on an<br />\nequal basis.<br />\nQ. How many interviews<br />\ndoes the admission committee<br />\nusually grant at Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School?<br />\nA. During the last five years<br />\nthe number of interviews varied<br />\nfrom 600 to 950 per year.<br />\nApproximately one out of three<br />\nor four applicants received an<br />\ninterview. Emphasis is placed<br />\nupon the recommendations of<br />\nthe medical school advisors.<br />\nSince we have great confidence<br />\n<br />\nin the judgement of Dr. Gryder,<br />\nhis staff and the Hopkins faculty, a well qualified student from<br />\nthe Homewood campus should<br />\nexpect to receive thorough consideration from the committee.<br />\nQ. Has any one school<br />\ncontributed a particularly large<br />\nnumber of students in recent<br />\nyears to the medical school?<br />\nA. There has been a wide<br />\ngeographic spread and considerable diversity of undergraduate<br />\nschools. However, the medical<br />\nschool has received many students from the Ivy League<br />\nschools in recent years. Last ;<br />\nyear Harvard sent a large number<br />\nof students to the medical<br />\nschool. This was apparently<br />\nrelated to the fact that Harvard<br />\noffered many outstanding minority applicants.<br />\nThe second part of this article<br />\nwill appear in the next issue.<br />\n<br />\nffikpA<br />\nmytiPielow'<br />\n\\Tog<br />\nPiedmont Airlines'discount fares are like money from<br />\nhome!<br />\nSuper Saver Fare saves you a super 25%(Fri. thru Sun.)<br />\nor 35%(Mon. thru Thurs.) roundtrip if you make your reservations and ticket purchase 30 days before departure, and<br />\nstay at least 7 days.<br />\nWeekend Excursion Fare means a 30% roundtrip discount if you leave Saturday and return any day except Sunday(12:01 pm until midnight)or Friday.<br />\nFor complete information, including time and reservation<br />\nrequirements and fare availability, see your travel agent or<br />\ncall Piedmont Airlines.

The<br />\nfilms were made available for a<br />\nthree-day booking by the French<br />\nEmbassy's Cultural Services Of--<br />\n<br />\nfices, admittedly an alien<br />\nagency. The programs were free<br />\nand supported by a small grant<br />\nfrom the Maryland Committee<br />\nfor the Humanities, another<br />\ngroup of \"outsiders.\"<br />\nOne<br />\nof the sponsors, who supplied an<br />\nexpert projectionist, was the<br />\nBaltimore Film Forum, which<br />\nseems especially to arouse Mr.<br />\nBloom's hostility. The programs<br />\nwere also sponsored, however,<br />\nby the JHU Department of<br />\nRomance Languages and the<br />\nHumanities Center, which however peripheral to the intellectual life of Hopkins -- do<br />\noccupy space on the campus.<br />\nIn addition, the speakers at the<br />\nfilms were drawn from Homewood faculty and students. The<br />\n<br />\nauditorium was made available francophile perverts. Another<br />\nthrough the generosity of the program of the \"Semaines Uni-Department of Biology as a versitaires\" was presented la t<br />\ncultural event on a weekend that year, also with Hopkins co-spondid not interfere with its own sorship, at the Baltimore Muuse of this handsome new seum of Art, now going through<br />\nfacility.

He apparently enjoys the<br />\nof entertainment films( and I lively fare offered by the Senior<br />\ncan appreciate some of the Class Film Series and the Weekreasons why).

Like the Senior Class<br />\nseries, however, the Office of the<br />\nChaplain aims to show a profit<br />\n<br />\non screenings (in order to<br />\nsupport other eminently worthy<br />\nactivities). This obviously leaves<br />\nroom for groups aiming at<br />\nmore specialized and less popular tastes that dare not try to<br />\ncover their expenses through<br />\nticket-sales alone. The existence<br />\nof such groups should add to the<br />\nthickening of the cultural soup<br />\nrather than its impoverishment.<br />\nThe Film Forum, which has<br />\nduring the past few years enlisted the energies of a number<br />\nof Hopkins students and faculty,<br />\nwould seem to fall in the latter<br />\ncategory, depending on grants,<br />\ngifts, and the Baltimore Film<br />\nFestival to try to break even.<br />\nThis philosophy allows for a<br />\ndifferent sort of programming,<br />\nbut hardly the sort of imperial-ism that Mr. Bloom suggests.<br />\nThus, lasst year Prof. Leo Braudy<br />\nwas able to offer an entire series<br />\non the films of Jean Renoir with<br />\naccompanying lectures.

I'd also note<br />\nthat the Film Forum has,<br />\nhowever, always avoided screen-ing on the nights traditionally<br />\nclaimed by the JHU groups--the<br />\nSenior Class, the Reel World,<br />\nand the Weekend Wonder Flix.<br />\nFinally, Mr. Bloom objects<br />\nto the Film Forum giving a<br />\ncomplete listing of its own<br />\nfilms in a calendar that it dis-tributes. What seems to me<br />\nmore symptomatic is that the<br />\nsame calendar also attempts to<br />\nlist films in the Baltimore area<br />\noffered by other groups! This<br />\neffort (and it is an effort to<br />\ngather the information in any<br />\nreliable way) is perhaps the best<br />\nclue to the sort of cultural<br />\npluralism that is allegedly one of<br />\nthe high ideals of a university.<br />\nHopkins has too often taken<br />\ncriticism for its walls and isola-tion, but in its best moments it<br />\nhas been remarkably open to<br />\n\"alien\" influences and the con-cerns of \"outsiders\". It seems to<br />\nme that there is room on the<br />\ncampus for Tom Jones and Cat<br />\nBallou, but I would hope that<br />\nthere is also room for an occa-sional invasion by a short film of<br />\nAstruc or a little-known late film<br />\nby Jean-Pierre Melville. (Although the audience for the<br />\nlatter are bound to be small, it<br />\nshould not be frightening that<br />\nthe audience includes some<br />\nfaculty and students from neighboring institutions, a U.S. Senator, and a few visitors from<br />\nWashington.) In his farewell<br />\naddress to Hopkins on leaving<br />\nfor Oxford the prickly first<br />\nprofessor of mathematics, J.J.<br />\nSylvester, said that it should be<br />\nthe goal of a genuine university<br />\nto bring people of \"different<br />\npursuits not only into contact,<br />\nbut into absolute intercommunication and contact and<br />\ncollision; and not only to<br />\nintermingle, but to collide studies about.\" This may seem a<br />\nlittle hazardous for the weak of<br />\nheart, but film studies for one<br />\nwould seem to thrive on this sort<br />\nof freedom.

Any minute<br />\nnow. ,You'll see. Many a time one of us would get<br />\ndisgusted (i.e. discouraged) at the Rat or Mary Fischer or<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion and march out shouting \"You assholes<br />\ncan stay here and take this abuse all night if you want,<br />\nbut I'm going to the Block.- Or something to that<br />\neffect. Invariably we would find this renegado back at<br />\nthe Dorms, curled up around a bottle of something that<br />\nwas vile but quick -- or stretched out on the rear seat of<br />\nthe Goucher Shuttle, a snapshot of his high school<br />\nHoney clutched in his mittened hands. We all spouted<br />\nsuch empty bravado at one time or another, but I think<br />\nwe can be quite forgiven. We were naive and full of shit,<br />\nyes indeed. But then again, we were freshmen, and, for<br />\nthe vast majority of freshmen at Hopkins, being naive<br />\nand full of shit is required -- as required as Intro Chem or<br />\nthe Sun rising in the east.<br />\nOn my nineteenth birthday, I was bound and<br />\nblindfolded by my dorm mates and hustled into a<br />\nwaiting car, which sped away from the quad with tires<br />\nsquealing and beer tops popping. We were bound for The<br />\nBlock, where, they assured me, a prostitute whom they<br />\nhad engaged would effect my long-delayed deflowering.<br />\nNeedless to say, I was terrified.<br />\nA virgin on the Block? I had wanted my first<br />\ntime to be cozy and lovey-dovey and all that. I had<br />\nwanted to spend a magic night intwined around some<br />\nfreckeleC, wholesome girl and wake to see what Goucher<br />\nlooked like at dawn. Now it looked as though the only<br />\nthing I'd see in the morning would be the pecker-checker<br />\nat the Dorm Clinic. The bastards were throwing a Iamb<br />\nto the wolves, and they thought it was just as funny as<br />\nHell. I made excuses. I pleaded and begged. I even told<br />\nthem I was impotent. \"You'd better not be, Baldridge.<br />\nI hear that if you don't use it inside of ten minutes, the<br />\nbouncer gets pissed and cuts it off! Haw! Haw! Haw!\"<br />\nThat was it --. I began trying to break out the passenger<br />\nwindow with my forehead.<br />\nYou can imagine the mixture of relief and<br />\nred-faced humiliation I felt when the blindfold was<br />\nremoved and I fould myself at the entrance to one of<br />\nLittle Italy's chic restaurants.<br />\nThe Block would have to wait for another night,<br />\nthank God.<br />\n<br />\nI heard about the Block before I ever set foot in<br />\nBaltimore. It was at one of our enormous family reunions the summer before my freshman year, when college<br />\nwas still an unknown and unlimited potential, that I was<br />\nfirst told,of the mysterious place. The eyes of one of<br />\nmy uncles - an old sea dog who had seen the bottom<br />\nside of many a harbor town -- lit up when he learned<br />\nthat I was to weigh anchor in Charm City.<br />\n\"Baltimore, huh?\" he chuckled. \"Well, if you<br />\never get bored with the books, there's always The Block.<br />\nNow, if 'yer Aunt Rita knew I was tellin' you this, she'd<br />\nhave my ass for sure.\" I was interested already -- things<br />\nwhich pissed off Aunt Rita almost always included a<br />\ngood deal of fun.<br />\nLater in the evening, a cousin of mine who had<br />\nonce been in the Navy also mentioned The Block. Being<br />\nan insurance adjuster instead of an old sea-dog, however,<br />\nhis-endorsement was somewhat more cautious.<br />\nNo matter what - the seed of curiosity had<br />\nalready taken root in my brain. Because of the maritime<br />\nbackground of my two informants, the image which I<br />\ndeveloped of The Block became inseperable from the<br />\nSea. I imagined it as existing on the waterfront, with<br />\nrickety pilings tenuously holding the whole affair above<br />\nWhy it took me until just recently to get around<br />\ndark and ominous waters. I peopled it with incredibly<br />\nfat chiefs and kitchen's'mates from warships, which, for to it, I don't know. East Baltimore St. is quite close to a<br />\nall I knew, pulled right up to the wharf in order to lot of other Charm City attractions, and I saw its dandisgourge their liberty-hungry, lovestarved sailors. I cing neon from car windows quite often while in route<br />\nconjured up good-hearted whores in tight red dresses, to restaurants and parties. Most of the fear was gone, but<br />\nHumphrey Bogart sitting alone in a corner, and back so was much of the curiosity. After a few carnal experirooms filled with dense, red smoke and the sound of ences, the freshman terror of women usually changes to<br />\nfalling poker chips. It was, I suppose, a cross between a type of intermittent despair, and consequently a place<br />\nDisneyland and \u2022Gomorrah. I was a freshman terrified like The Block loses much of its power and mystery. I<br />\nof almost everything, and it suited me just dandy to knew that going there was one of those things that<br />\nbelieve that such a place existed not five miles from the \"everyone-ought-to-do-just-to-say-they-have \", but I wa!<br />\n<br />\nalways able to justify putting it off. My father lived in<br />\nWashington for thirty years and claims that he never got<br />\naround to visiting the Washington Monument. I know<br />\nhow it goes...when you live in a place, you can always<br />\nplay tourist \"tomorrow.\"<br />\nOddly enough, my long-awaited trek to Baltimore St. began with a visit to the offices of the Goucher<br />\nWeekly. I mention this, not to make any wiseass analogies or to further lower my already shabby position in<br />\nthe eyes of their editor, Ms. Bartolovitch --but rather to<br />\nunderscore the fact that this gala outing was in no way<br />\nplanned. Two of my editors and I had simply gotten<br />\ncurious as to what the Weekly was all about, and decided<br />\nto have a look. We found pretty much what we should<br />\nhave expected to find on a production night -- a group of<br />\npeople too busy to help us drink the case of Miller we<br />\nhad brought along to break the ice. Forced to consume<br />\nall of the mind-altering beverage ourselves, it wasn't long<br />\nbefore one of us half jokingly made the suggestion that<br />\nwe visit The Block. We had time to kill. We had a car.<br />\nWe had money. We had a few more beers and all was<br />\ndecided we would go. The World, the Flesh, and the<br />\nDevil awaited...we need only pluck the dangling apple.<br />\nJust as Baltimore has a World Trade Center and a<br />\nWashington Monument which are on a smaller scale than<br />\ntheir namesakes in other cities, so too is our Combat<br />\nZone, our Jisim Trail, smaller than others of national<br />\nrepute. Indeed, the collection of show bars and sex<br />\narcades on F. Baltimore St. is accurately named, for the<br />\nwhole affair stretches for little more than a city block.<br />\nIt is so compact and stands in such contrast to the<br />\ndusky surroundings, that one could easily perceive it as<br />\nbeing a monolithic entity and a synchronozed whole,<br />\nrather than a band of fiercely competing establishments.<br />\nOur first stop was at one of the half-dozen sex<br />\narcades. These carnal supermarkets are so brilliantly<br />\nlighted that upon stepping inside, the feeling is one of<br />\nhaving entered the interior of a spotlit diamond. The<br />\nsales counter is made entirely of glass, and raises the<br />\nsuspicious cashier to an intimidating height above the<br />\ngawking patrons. On three sides the walls are literally<br />\ncovered with square boxes containing film reels and<br />\nvideocassettes- the. front of each displa% in:: a color still<br />\nfrom the enclosed movie, apparently repicentative of<br />\nthe work as a whole. They are grouped b) genre: anal,<br />\noral, two men and a woman, two women and a man,<br />\noutright orgies, gay males, lesbians, twin sisters, interracial, with animals, on motorcycles. etc., etc.... the list<br />\ngois on and on. The titles of these epics are less than<br />\nmemorable. The price is $75.00 a piece, no pun intended.<br />\n<br />\n\fact Or Fantasy<br />\n<br />\ns Baldridge<br />\ny David Newman<br />\n<br />\nAlong the final wall are the sex novelties. The<br />\nparticular establishment we were patronizing carried the<br />\ncompete line of Doc Johnson's\" Marital Aids.\" These<br />\nrubber reproductions of male and female organs, doggie<br />\nchew-toys at first glance. but a closer inspection reveals<br />\nthe careful attempt to simulate nature's originals in<br />\nplastic and paint. An analogy might be drawn between<br />\nthis and The Block as a whole, but I will certainly not be<br />\nSO foolhardy as to attempt it. The stern, authoritative<br />\nreproduction of Doc Johnson stands above the entire<br />\ndisplay. resplendant in his starched lab coat and dangling<br />\nstethoscope. His stern features seem to warn the drooling wino and the scoffing college boy not to take his<br />\nhumanitarian and professional commitment to sexual<br />\ntherapy lightly, for the Doc is a dedicated man. He<br />\nprobably went to Hopkins.<br />\nA doorway at the back leads to a long corridor<br />\nlined with quarter-a-shot movie booths. Upon entering,<br />\nthe megawatt brightness immediately eases, being<br />\nreplaced by the soft illumination of red-painted lightbulbs -- the kind of lighting we were always told to<br />\nexpect. You simply pick one of the numbered booths,<br />\nstep inside-, and drop two bits into the machine. The<br />\nmovie begins immediately, being projected from a<br />\nhidden recess above and behind your head. I felt like<br />\nJim Phelps on 'Mission Impossible.' After about thirty<br />\nsecond, just when something interesting is about to<br />\nhappen, the projector ceases whirring and you're left<br />\nstaring at the No Loitering sign on the door. Another<br />\nquarter and the action begins anew, only to abruptly<br />\nhalt once more on the verge of an insertion. an orgasm,<br />\nor the introduction of a whip. The movies themselves<br />\nare pretty standard stuff, but I must admit to becoming<br />\nfascinated with the timing of the things. Whoever edited<br />\nthose cinematic classics managed to include a dozen<br />\nframes of real interest every thirty seconds. It's the<br />\nmental version of eating Doritos \u2014 you always have to<br />\nhave just one more.<br />\nThe atmosphere in the show bars is quite different, but the routine is just as predictable and inflexible.<br />\nAs the disco begins to blare, a woman climbs the three<br />\nsteps up to the bartop, her white pumps glowing in the<br />\nblacklight. Once there, she begins dancing with, all the<br />\nenthusiasm of a narcoleptic. In a nighty for the first<br />\nsong, topless for the second,and nakei for the third, she<br />\ngoes about her business like an automaton. To say that<br />\nthese women look bored is akin to calling Marty Bass<br />\nobnoxious --a laughable understatement. They seem to<br />\nbe somewhere else entirely, rocking back and forth as<br />\nthey arrange grocery lists or tally up tips in their heads.<br />\nSome are ugly, others quite pretty, but all are distant.<br />\nThere is no question of physical contact -- these women<br />\n<br />\nperform their tired routines well out of the customers'<br />\nreach, a line of whiskey bottles standing guard on the<br />\nilluminated bar shelf at their feet.<br />\nDown on ground level, another set routine is<br />\nperformed. The bar girls, decked out in backless dresses<br />\nor hot pants,bend over the seated patrons to whisper:<br />\n\"Looking for some company, hon?\" An affirmative<br />\nanswer brings a smile, the pressure of a hand on your<br />\nforearm, and the soft request: \"Why don't you buy me<br />\na drink?\" A negative reply gets you a \"Cheap bastard!\"<br />\nand an extremely withering look.<br />\nThe standard procedure is simple. When you<br />\nadopt a bar girl, the first drink is $3, the second $10, and<br />\nso on until the proper amount has changed hands. This<br />\npractice avoids legal troubles, as well as allowing the<br />\nwomen to screen out the more obvious psychos before<br />\nany doors are closed.<br />\nOur drinks finished, we spill out into the street<br />\nand head for another bar. The barkers' speeches are also<br />\nnearly identical, their sharp words being fired machinegun fashion at the passing suckers. \"C'mon in, c'mon in.<br />\nFree look guys have a free look hey guys don't cheat<br />\nyourselves hey CHECKITOUT!\" No matter what bar we around it wherever possible, like a death in the family<br />\nenter, the pattern is identical. They really have but one that one tactfully tries to avoid. As a result, I received<br />\nitem to peddle, and no one sees any reason to change so precious little hard information about the inner worksuccessful a marketing technique.<br />\nings of The Block.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium concluded Monday<br />\nwith a talk by Dr. Gerard Piel,<br />\npresident and publisher of Scientific American magazine. Piel<br />\nspoke on the transition the<br />\nworld will make as it enters<br />\nanother millenium.<br />\nPiel began by presenting a<br />\nperspective on the history of our<br />\nexistence on earth, proposing<br />\nthat man's time compares to<br />\n\"the last 15 minutes of a 24-hour<br />\nclock.\" He claimed that science,<br />\ndeveloped during thr- Renaissance, had a drastic impact on<br />\nhuman life. According to Piel,<br />\nobjective knowledge has made<br />\nthe individual sovereign over<br />\nlong-enduring religious restrictions, and has demonstrated the<br />\nunity of all human races (we<br />\nhave the same amino acids).<br />\nThe revolution in ideas<br /><br />\nbrought about by science has<br />\nbeen accompanied by an equally<br />\nsignificant increase in population<br />\nbrought about by higher standards of living, Piel said. He<br />\nshowed five slides demonstrating<br />\nthe growth of world population<br />\nafter 1600, the beginning of the L'<br />\nScientific Revolution. From at<br />\n4 billion people at that!<br />\n1<br />\ncount of /<br />\ntime, the number was estimated<br />\nat 1 billion in 1800 and 2 billion<br />\nby 1925, a figure which had<br />\ndoubled again by 1970. This<br />\ngrowth is due not to an increase<br />\nin the birth rate, but to a decrease in deaths and a longer<br />\nlifespan in nations with higher<br />\nstandards of living.<br />\nPiel noted that in more<br />\norganized nations the population<br />\nhas recently begun approaching<br />\nzero. population growth. The<br />\nU.S. and China are prime examples, albeit U.S. citizens enjoy a<br />\nwealthier lifestyle than their<br />\nOriental counterparts.

Den. Hey... we know that comments on the antiIranian graffiti would make for juicier copy, but the<br />\nCouncil really outdid themselves this Wednesday, and we<br />\nfeel that they deserve as many column inches as any other<br />\nmajor disaster on campus.<br />\nIf you have been paying attention at all this year, then<br />\nyou know that the Council and the SAC have been using<br />\nthe buzz-phrase \"discusion of personalities\" as an excuse<br />\nto cover-up anything which they feel is too embarrasing<br />\nto inform the students about. Well, this week they .clecided to come out of the closet, and the result was so<br />\nridiculous that it almost makes us wish they'd return to<br />\ntheir clandestine habits.<br />\nApparently, Tom Messana spent the better part of<br />\nWednesday night's four-and-a-half hour bffe-a-thcn, explaining to an irrate Boss Connolly how the News-Letter<br />\nviciously libeled him. We make no claim of infallibility,<br />\nbut we must point out that Mr. Messana read the offending<br />\narticle before it went to press and declared it fit to print.<br />\nAh well, hindsight is 20-20-- especially when Big George is<br />\nbreathing down your neck... right, Tom?<br />\nMessana's \"change of heart\" is really small spuds<br />\ncompared to the center ring performances, though. When<br />\nKarl \"it's-closed-because-it's-not-open\" Block winds up<br />\ndefending freedom of information on this campus, then<br />\nhis antagonist must surely be a censor of the first water.<br />\nEnter Sid Goodfriend...staunch defender of the Council's<br />\nGod-given right to squander our money in secrecy. Sid was<br />\nmuch concerned about whether Council members have<br />\nan \"automatic\" responsibility to thrash things out amongst<br />\nthemselves, instead of bothering the News-Letter and<br />\nthe students with all those tedious facts about the Council's inability to engage in any activity besides bickering.<br />\nSid the Silent may be right...but if so, we also contend that<br />\nthe News-Letter has an \"automatic\" responsibility to bring<br />\nthe pointless blatherings of the Council to light, and that<br />\nthe students have an equally automatic right to<br />\nthrow<br />\ntheir<br />\nearliest<br />\npossible<br />\nout<br />\nat<br />\nofoffice<br />\nsuch nironic WWWV1/46<br />\nconvenience.<br />\nConno117 confidant Robert Elkin, evidently uninformed about the Council's nearly month-old status as a pitiful<br />\ncollection of battling egos, expressed the hope that its<br />\nparliamentary masturbation wouldn't \"develop into a<br />\ncharade and a lot of silliness.\" Gee, we hope not, too, Bob.<br />\nThe sad fact of the matter is that the Student Council has<br />\nindeed ceased to provide any meaningful service to the<br />\nstudent body. What began as a promising year has quickly<br />\ndegenerated into a desperate fight among the various petty<br />\npoliticos to save face amidst an orgy of backstabbing and<br />\npersonal conflict.<br />\nGeorge Connolly, a man who possesses a realistic grasp<br />\nof just what the Student Council can and cannot do to<br />\naffect Administration policy, had some excellent ideas at<br />\nthe semester's beginning for furthering student interests.<br />\n(In case you've forgotten, that is the purpose of the<br />\nCouncil.) Unfortunately, it is not at all clear, at this point,<br />\nwhether George has himself escaped the general malaise<br />\nwhich has afflicted his fellow members. And even if<br />\nhe still has his wits fully about him, what member of the<br />\nAdministration is going to take the Council's suggestions<br />\nseriously now?<br /><br />\nProblem<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to comment of<br />\nMr. Alex Kodat's (pinhead)<br />\narticle of Nov. 9. I had reservations about writing these cornments, thinking that they might<br />\nbe considered too vitriolic for a<br />\nuniversity newsletter. Having<br />\nseen such editorials as \"Enough<br />\nCrap!\" and \"Access Sucks\",<br />\nhowever, I have suppressed my<br />\nqualms and sent this anyway.<br />\nIn the first place, Voltaire,<br />\nwho certainly suffered enough in<br />\nhis lifetime, is being badgered by<br />\nnonexistent quotations. To wit,<br />\nhe never said, \"I may disagree<br />\nwith what you say, but I will<br />\ndefend to the death your right<br />\nto say it\" This is a Voltaire<br />\nparaphrase by S.G. Tallentyre,<br />\nwhose works are not usually<br />\nfound in quotation compedia.<br />\nDisagreeeing with Mr. Pin-head over details, however, does<br />\nnot mean that I believe in<br />\nwanton destruction of posters.<br />\nOn the contrary, I will defend to<br />\nthe death an individual's right to<br />\ndeface our buildings. After all,<br />\nposters fulfill a very necessary<br />\npurpose at Hopkins - they save<br />\nmoney on wallpaper.<br />\nIn a serious vein, however,<br />\nhave three comments to make:<br />\na) the editorial writer ought, in<br />\nthe future, to send his advertisements through the mailboxes in<br />\nthe New Dorms, b) a newsletter<br />\nwhich normally deals with such<br />\nissues as rent control, campus<br />\nsecurity, and consumer protection is not the place to complain<br />\nabout missing placards, and c)<br />\nthe posters were probably blown<br />\naway.<br />\nDavid Drewer<br />\nHey, Dave. What you have<br />\njust written is commonly referred to as a Letter To The Editor.<br />\nIt is not an Editorial. The<br />\nEditorial is the natty item to the<br />\nimmediate left of this response<br />\nby the Editor. Is your confusion<br />\nnow at an end? Good.<br />\n--C.B.<br /><br />\nAmerica!!<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nWhat the hell has happened<br />\nto the United States? Since<br />\nWorld War II the United States,<br />\nonce undefeated in war, has<br />\ngotten fat. In Korea we acceded<br />\nto a tie. In Vietnam we lost.<br />\nNow we arc getting pushed<br />\naround by a bunch of goddamn<br />\nArabs and Moslem holy men.<br />\nThe United States has simply<br />\nbecoMe afraid of its own power,<br /><br />\nas well as too damn noble and<br />\ngoodie-twoshoes to resort to a<br />\nlittle muscle flexing to get its<br />\nway.<br />\nThe American revolution of<br />\ntwo hundred years ago showed<br />\nAmerica to .the world as the<br />\nmighty underdog capable of<br />\nbeating none other than the<br />\nBritish Empire. Shortly thereafter we defended this hardfought<br />\nfor revolution against the still<br />\npowerful British. Our respect<br />\nthroughout the world heightened as the mighty Eagle returned to tend its own nest for<br />\nyears. When provoked by the<br />\ndestruction of the Maine, Teddy<br />\nRoosevelt led the Rough Riders<br />\nto a stunning victory against the<br />\nSpanish. Both World Wars can<br />\nmark as their turning points<br />\nthe U.S. entry into battle. Black<br />\nJack Pershing led a group of<br />\nun-combattrained Amercans into<br />\nthe First World War and turned<br />\nback the devastating German<br />\nArmy. And in World War II<br />\nnone other than Patton, MacArthur, Eisehnower and many<br />\nothers led a well tuned American<br />\nfighting machine that staged<br />\nsuccessful war on two fronts.<br />\nHowever, the war in the<br />\nPacific was won using two atom<br />\nbombs. The destruction unleashed caused America to look<br />\ntwice at its role as the saviour of<br />\ndemocracy. When the Russians<br />\ngot their hands on the bomb<br />\nsuddenly Americans decided it<br />\nwas time to play school marm to<br />\nthe rest of the world rather than<br />\nthe jail warden image once<br />\nconveyed.<br />\nSince 1945 the<br />\nworld's attitude has shifted from<br />\nadmiration and respect to jibes<br />\nFrom rolling<br />\nand ridicule.<br />\nover the Hun in W.W.II we have<br />\ncome to speechifying the enemy<br />\nas our main means of attack.<br />\nOur tie in Korea and loss in<br />\nVietnam has pointed out that<br />\nthe United States is gullible and<br />\nvulnerable.<br />\nThe attitude is<br />\nshared by many Americans.<br />\nWhen Barry Goldwater was<br />\nlabeled as an A-bomb tosser he<br />\nwas thoroughly throttled in his<br />\nattempt to become president<br />\nand ridiculed throughout the<br />\nland as warmonger. All I can say<br />\nabout L.B.J. is we got what<br />\nwe voted for.<br />\nIsrael is an excellent example of what America once was<br />\nand still should be. The Israeli<br />\nArmy has repeatedly done the<br />\nremarkable and considerable<br />\ntask of defending their little<br />\nswatch of land from villainous,<br />\nhateful enemies on all sides.<br />\nTheir faith in their own power is<br />\nso considerable they feel safe in<br />\nreturning some of their captured<br />\nterritories. Several times since<br />\nIsrael's existence have they repelled attackers and drove them<br />\ndeep into their own land. In<br />\naddition Israeli commandoes re-<br /><br />\ncorded one of the most daring<br />\nand precise raids ever in rescuing<br />\ntheir people at the Entebbe<br />\nAirport.<br />\nOn the other hand America<br />\nand the rest of the Western<br />\nWorld sit on their asses as OPEC<br />\nhikes oil prices to such levels<br />\nthat many Americans have to<br />\nface the decision: heat or eat.<br />\nNow the incident of Iranian<br />\nstudents holding Americans hostage further reflects the attitude<br />\nof a fat, ineffectual America.<br />\nWe must repulse the Ayatollah<br />\nand now make him suffer for his<br />\nsins.<br />\nWe can no longer<br />\nignore him. If we want to treat a<br />\nsick Shah for cancer or help a<br />\nwell one plot a counterrevolution that's our business and<br />\nany screwball Moslem holy men<br />\nthat don't like it can take a hike.<br />\nThis incident in Iran must<br />\nhe a turning point in American<br />\nforeign policy.

BLUMENTHAL<br />\nDr. Norman Anderson has<br />\nrecently assumed the position of<br />\nDirector of Admissions at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical School.<br />\nAfter graduation from the University of Montana, Dr. Anderson attended Washington University Medical School in St.<br />\nLouis. Subsequently, he served<br />\non the staff of the Johns Hopkins Hospital as intern, resident<br />\nand chief resident in medicine.<br />\nDuring three years of additional<br />\ntraining at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania, D. Anderson was<br />\nengaged in laboratory investigaHe returned to Johns<br />\ntion.<br />\nHopkins to pursue a career<br />\nin teaching, clinical care of<br />\npatients and medical research.<br />\nQ. How does Hopkins regard women applicants? Does<br />\nthe medical school consider<br />\nthem a special interest group?<br />\nA. Hopkins has had a major<br />\ncommittment to train women as<br />\nmedical students for many years.<br />\nOne problem recently has been<br />\nthe concern that women applicants have had about the geographical surroundings of the<br />\nmedical institutions. The social-economic environment has<br />\nmade it difficult to get many<br />\nwomen to train at Hopkins. We<br />\nhave tried to remedy this situation.<br />\nQ. Dr. Muller has stated that<br />\nthe applicants to Hopkins reflect<br />\nthe applicant pool in terms of<br />\nwomen, men and minorities.<br />\nDoes this statement apply to<br />\nmedical school admission policies?<br />\nA. We have no precise goals<br />\nor guidelines: every application<br />\nis considered on an individual<br />\nbasis. The committee makes ,a<br />\nstrong effort to seek out excellence and outstanding future<br />\npotential. This is the prime<br />\nconsideration. Everything else is<br />\nsecondary to this effort.<br />\nQ. Dr. Anderson, is it your<br />\nresponsibility to make a preliminary review ofall the applicants<br />\nor is this evaluation parceled out<br />\nto members of the committee?<br />\nA. Normally the preliminary<br />\nreview of applicants is divided<br />\nup by members of the committee. At present, However, I am<br />\nmaking an effort to evaluate all<br />\nof the applications so that I<br />\nmight obtain some appraisal of<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nvarious<br />\nthe<br />\nschools in this country. In the<br />\nfuture much of this work will be<br />\nperformed by members of the<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nQ. Last year there were several<br />\narticles in the News-Letter<br />\nconcerning the admission of<br />\nto<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nHopkins<br />\nHopkins medical school. Some<br />\nof the students on the Homewood campus felt that they were<br />\nreceiving less consideration than<br />\nstudents at other schools. Was<br />\nthere any reason why Hopkins<br />\nmedical school appeared to<br />\ndiscriminate against Hopkilts<br />\nundergraduates?<br />\nA. In most universities the<br />\nmedical schools usually admit<br />\nthe largest proportion of students from their affiliated undergraduate school. Last yeat<br />\ntwo particular medical schools<br /><br />\ndid not follow this policy. They<br />\nwere Yale and Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIf one reviews admissions records for the past decade, one<br />\nwill observe that Hopkins Medical School usually followed the<br />\npractice of most other medical<br />\nschools.<br />\nI believe that the admissions<br />\ncommittee tries to compare<br />\nstudents from Hopkins with<br />\nthose from other schools on an<br />\nequal basis.<br />\nQ. How many interviews<br />\ndoes the admission committee<br />\nusually grant at Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School?<br />\nA. During the last five years<br />\nthe number of interviews varied<br />\nfrom 600 to 950 per year.<br />\nApproximately one out of three<br />\nor four applicants received an<br />\ninterview. Emphasis is placed<br />\nupon the recommendations of<br />\nthe medical school advisors.<br />\nSince we have great confidence<br /><br />\nin the judgement of Dr. Gryder,<br />\nhis staff and the Hopkins faculty, a well qualified student from<br />\nthe Homewood campus should<br />\nexpect to receive thorough consideration from the committee.<br />\nQ. Has any one school<br />\ncontributed a particularly large<br />\nnumber of students in recent<br />\nyears to the medical school?<br />\nA. There has been a wide<br />\ngeographic spread and considerable diversity of undergraduate<br />\nschools. However, the medical<br />\nschool has received many students from the Ivy League<br />\nschools in recent years. Last ;<br />\nyear Harvard sent a large number<br />\nof students to the medical<br />\nschool. This was apparently<br />\nrelated to the fact that Harvard<br />\noffered many outstanding minority applicants.<br />\nThe second part of this article<br />\nwill appear in the next issue.<br /><br />\nffikpA<br />\nmytiPielow'<br />\n\\Tog<br />\nPiedmont Airlines'discount fares are like money from<br />\nhome!<br />\nSuper Saver Fare saves you a super 25%(Fri. thru Sun.)<br />\nor 35%(Mon. thru Thurs.) roundtrip if you make your reservations and ticket purchase 30 days before departure, and<br />\nstay at least 7 days.<br />\nWeekend Excursion Fare means a 30% roundtrip discount if you leave Saturday and return any day except Sunday(12:01 pm until midnight)or Friday.<br />\nFor complete information, including time and reservation<br />\nrequirements and fare availability, see your travel agent or<br />\ncall Piedmont Airlines.

The<br />\nfilms were made available for a<br />\nthree-day booking by the French<br />\nEmbassy's Cultural Services Of--<br /><br />\nfices, admittedly an alien<br />\nagency. The programs were free<br />\nand supported by a small grant<br />\nfrom the Maryland Committee<br />\nfor the Humanities, another<br />\ngroup of \"outsiders.\"<br />\nOne<br />\nof the sponsors, who supplied an<br />\nexpert projectionist, was the<br />\nBaltimore Film Forum, which<br />\nseems especially to arouse Mr.<br />\nBloom's hostility. The programs<br />\nwere also sponsored, however,<br />\nby the JHU Department of<br />\nRomance Languages and the<br />\nHumanities Center, which however peripheral to the intellectual life of Hopkins -- do<br />\noccupy space on the campus.<br />\nIn addition, the speakers at the<br />\nfilms were drawn from Homewood faculty and students. The<br /><br />\nauditorium was made available francophile perverts. Another<br />\nthrough the generosity of the program of the \"Semaines Uni-Department of Biology as a versitaires\" was presented la t<br />\ncultural event on a weekend that year, also with Hopkins co-spondid not interfere with its own sorship, at the Baltimore Muuse of this handsome new seum of Art, now going through<br />\nfacility.

(Over the years I've<br />\ncounted myself fortunate to be<br />\ninvolved in the program discussions, which are always a little<br />\nlike making up a city political<br />\n\"ticket\".) The offerings have<br />\ncovered a wide gamut of tastes,<br />\nfrom The Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow to an occasional film by<br />\nAnd one<br />\nRobert Bresson.<br />\nshould add that under the<br />\nextraordinarily capable and gen-erous management of Lorinda<br />\nRiddle, surely one of the least-sung but most genuine of local<br />\ncultural heroines, the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice also offered advice and<br />\nassistance to other groups and to<br />\nthose of us who were using films<br />\nin courses. Like the Senior Class<br />\nseries, however, the Office of the<br />\nChaplain aims to show a profit<br /><br />\non screenings (in order to<br />\nsupport other eminently worthy<br />\nactivities). This obviously leaves<br />\nroom for groups aiming at<br />\nmore specialized and less popular tastes that dare not try to<br />\ncover their expenses through<br />\nticket-sales alone. The existence<br />\nof such groups should add to the<br />\nthickening of the cultural soup<br />\nrather than its impoverishment.<br />\nThe Film Forum, which has<br />\nduring the past few years enlisted the energies of a number<br />\nof Hopkins students and faculty,<br />\nwould seem to fall in the latter<br />\ncategory, depending on grants,<br />\ngifts, and the Baltimore Film<br />\nFestival to try to break even.<br />\nThis philosophy allows for a<br />\ndifferent sort of programming,<br />\nbut hardly the sort of imperial-ism that Mr. Bloom suggests.<br />\nThus, lasst year Prof. Leo Braudy<br />\nwas able to offer an entire series<br />\non the films of Jean Renoir with<br />\naccompanying lectures.

John Molson, our founder, wouldn't recognize<br />\nour modem breweries, but he'd be proud of the<br />\ngood, smooth taste of GOLDEN.n\"<br />\nA taste that says Canada in every refreshing sip.<br /><br />\nthe time that I have worked with<br />\nboth the Chaplain's Office and<br />\nthe Film Forum, I have never<br />\nheard anyone so silly as to<br />\nsuggest that one group or tne<br />\nother \"planned to take over all<br />\nthe big movie series on the<br />\ncampus\" ( or the even sillier<br />\nassertion that \"the only movie<br />\naudience in Baltimore is on<br />\n(this) campus\"--take a trip to<br />\nTS11 sometime). I'd also note<br />\nthat the Film Forum has,<br />\nhowever, always avoided screen-ing on the nights traditionally<br />\nclaimed by the JHU groups--the<br />\nSenior Class, the Reel World,<br />\nand the Weekend Wonder Flix.<br />\nFinally, Mr. Bloom objects<br />\nto the Film Forum giving a<br />\ncomplete listing of its own<br />\nfilms in a calendar that it dis-tributes. What seems to me<br />\nmore symptomatic is that the<br />\nsame calendar also attempts to<br />\nlist films in the Baltimore area<br />\noffered by other groups! This<br />\neffort (and it is an effort to<br />\ngather the information in any<br />\nreliable way) is perhaps the best<br />\nclue to the sort of cultural<br />\npluralism that is allegedly one of<br />\nthe high ideals of a university.<br />\nHopkins has too often taken<br />\ncriticism for its walls and isola-tion, but in its best moments it<br />\nhas been remarkably open to<br />\n\"alien\" influences and the con-cerns of \"outsiders\". It seems to<br />\nme that there is room on the<br />\ncampus for Tom Jones and Cat<br />\nBallou, but I would hope that<br />\nthere is also room for an occa-sional invasion by a short film of<br />\nAstruc or a little-known late film<br />\nby Jean-Pierre Melville. (Although the audience for the<br />\nlatter are bound to be small, it<br />\nshould not be frightening that<br />\nthe audience includes some<br />\nfaculty and students from neighboring institutions, a U.S. Senator, and a few visitors from<br />\nWashington.) In his farewell<br />\naddress to Hopkins on leaving<br />\nfor Oxford the prickly first<br />\nprofessor of mathematics, J.J.<br />\nSylvester, said that it should be<br />\nthe goal of a genuine university<br />\nto bring people of \"different<br />\npursuits not only into contact,<br />\nbut into absolute intercommunication and contact and<br />\ncollision; and not only to<br />\nintermingle, but to collide studies about.\" This may seem a<br />\nlittle hazardous for the weak of<br />\nheart, but film studies for one<br />\nwould seem to thrive on this sort<br />\nof freedom. I only regret that<br />\nthere is not some group lurking<br />\ninside or outside our walls<br />\ndedicated to screening animation<br />\nfilms or Stan Brakliage(we once'<br />\nhad such a group).<br />\nI must apologize for tres-passing on your space, but I<br />\ncould not write to Mr. Bloom<br />\ndirectly since he did not appear<br />\nin the Student Directory or the<br />\nFaculty and Staff Directory,<br />\nand no local affiliation was<br />\ngiven.

Any minute<br />\nnow. ,You'll see. Many a time one of us would get<br />\ndisgusted (i.e. discouraged) at the Rat or Mary Fischer or<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion and march out shouting \"You assholes<br />\ncan stay here and take this abuse all night if you want,<br />\nbut I'm going to the Block.- Or something to that<br />\neffect. Invariably we would find this renegado back at<br />\nthe Dorms, curled up around a bottle of something that<br />\nwas vile but quick -- or stretched out on the rear seat of<br />\nthe Goucher Shuttle, a snapshot of his high school<br />\nHoney clutched in his mittened hands. We all spouted<br />\nsuch empty bravado at one time or another, but I think<br />\nwe can be quite forgiven. We were naive and full of shit,<br />\nyes indeed. But then again, we were freshmen, and, for<br />\nthe vast majority of freshmen at Hopkins, being naive<br />\nand full of shit is required -- as required as Intro Chem or<br />\nthe Sun rising in the east.<br />\nOn my nineteenth birthday, I was bound and<br />\nblindfolded by my dorm mates and hustled into a<br />\nwaiting car, which sped away from the quad with tires<br />\nsquealing and beer tops popping. We were bound for The<br />\nBlock, where, they assured me, a prostitute whom they<br />\nhad engaged would effect my long-delayed deflowering.<br />\nNeedless to say, I was terrified.<br />\nA virgin on the Block? I had wanted my first<br />\ntime to be cozy and lovey-dovey and all that. I had<br />\nwanted to spend a magic night intwined around some<br />\nfreckeleC, wholesome girl and wake to see what Goucher<br />\nlooked like at dawn. Now it looked as though the only<br />\nthing I'd see in the morning would be the pecker-checker<br />\nat the Dorm Clinic. The bastards were throwing a Iamb<br />\nto the wolves, and they thought it was just as funny as<br />\nHell. I made excuses. I pleaded and begged. I even told<br />\nthem I was impotent. \"You'd better not be, Baldridge.<br />\nI hear that if you don't use it inside of ten minutes, the<br />\nbouncer gets pissed and cuts it off! Haw! Haw! Haw!\"<br />\nThat was it --. I began trying to break out the passenger<br />\nwindow with my forehead.<br />\nYou can imagine the mixture of relief and<br />\nred-faced humiliation I felt when the blindfold was<br />\nremoved and I fould myself at the entrance to one of<br />\nLittle Italy's chic restaurants.<br />\nThe Block would have to wait for another night,<br />\nthank God.<br /><br />\nI heard about the Block before I ever set foot in<br />\nBaltimore. It was at one of our enormous family reunions the summer before my freshman year, when college<br />\nwas still an unknown and unlimited potential, that I was<br />\nfirst told,of the mysterious place. The eyes of one of<br />\nmy uncles - an old sea dog who had seen the bottom<br />\nside of many a harbor town -- lit up when he learned<br />\nthat I was to weigh anchor in Charm City.<br />\n\"Baltimore, huh?\" he chuckled. \"Well, if you<br />\never get bored with the books, there's always The Block.<br />\nNow, if 'yer Aunt Rita knew I was tellin' you this, she'd<br />\nhave my ass for sure.\" I was interested already -- things<br />\nwhich pissed off Aunt Rita almost always included a<br />\ngood deal of fun.<br />\nLater in the evening, a cousin of mine who had<br />\nonce been in the Navy also mentioned The Block. Being<br />\nan insurance adjuster instead of an old sea-dog, however,<br />\nhis-endorsement was somewhat more cautious.<br />\nNo matter what - the seed of curiosity had<br />\nalready taken root in my brain. Because of the maritime<br />\nbackground of my two informants, the image which I<br />\ndeveloped of The Block became inseperable from the<br />\nSea. I imagined it as existing on the waterfront, with<br />\nrickety pilings tenuously holding the whole affair above<br />\nWhy it took me until just recently to get around<br />\ndark and ominous waters. I peopled it with incredibly<br />\nfat chiefs and kitchen's'mates from warships, which, for to it, I don't know. East Baltimore St. is quite close to a<br />\nall I knew, pulled right up to the wharf in order to lot of other Charm City attractions, and I saw its dandisgourge their liberty-hungry, lovestarved sailors. I cing neon from car windows quite often while in route<br />\nconjured up good-hearted whores in tight red dresses, to restaurants and parties. Most of the fear was gone, but<br />\nHumphrey Bogart sitting alone in a corner, and back so was much of the curiosity. After a few carnal experirooms filled with dense, red smoke and the sound of ences, the freshman terror of women usually changes to<br />\nfalling poker chips. It was, I suppose, a cross between a type of intermittent despair, and consequently a place<br />\nDisneyland and \u2022Gomorrah. I was a freshman terrified like The Block loses much of its power and mystery. I<br />\nof almost everything, and it suited me just dandy to knew that going there was one of those things that<br />\nbelieve that such a place existed not five miles from the \"everyone-ought-to-do-just-to-say-they-have \", but I wa!<br /><br />\nalways able to justify putting it off. My father lived in<br />\nWashington for thirty years and claims that he never got<br />\naround to visiting the Washington Monument. I know<br />\nhow it goes...when you live in a place, you can always<br />\nplay tourist \"tomorrow.\"<br />\nOddly enough, my long-awaited trek to Baltimore St. began with a visit to the offices of the Goucher<br />\nWeekly. I mention this, not to make any wiseass analogies or to further lower my already shabby position in<br />\nthe eyes of their editor, Ms. Bartolovitch --but rather to<br />\nunderscore the fact that this gala outing was in no way<br />\nplanned. Two of my editors and I had simply gotten<br />\ncurious as to what the Weekly was all about, and decided<br />\nto have a look. We found pretty much what we should<br />\nhave expected to find on a production night -- a group of<br />\npeople too busy to help us drink the case of Miller we<br />\nhad brought along to break the ice. Forced to consume<br />\nall of the mind-altering beverage ourselves, it wasn't long<br />\nbefore one of us half jokingly made the suggestion that<br />\nwe visit The Block. We had time to kill. We had a car.<br />\nWe had money. We had a few more beers and all was<br />\ndecided we would go. The World, the Flesh, and the<br />\nDevil awaited...we need only pluck the dangling apple.<br />\nJust as Baltimore has a World Trade Center and a<br />\nWashington Monument which are on a smaller scale than<br />\ntheir namesakes in other cities, so too is our Combat<br />\nZone, our Jisim Trail, smaller than others of national<br />\nrepute. Indeed, the collection of show bars and sex<br />\narcades on F. Baltimore St. is accurately named, for the<br />\nwhole affair stretches for little more than a city block.<br />\nIt is so compact and stands in such contrast to the<br />\ndusky surroundings, that one could easily perceive it as<br />\nbeing a monolithic entity and a synchronozed whole,<br />\nrather than a band of fiercely competing establishments.<br />\nOur first stop was at one of the half-dozen sex<br />\narcades. These carnal supermarkets are so brilliantly<br />\nlighted that upon stepping inside, the feeling is one of<br />\nhaving entered the interior of a spotlit diamond. The<br />\nsales counter is made entirely of glass, and raises the<br />\nsuspicious cashier to an intimidating height above the<br />\ngawking patrons. On three sides the walls are literally<br />\ncovered with square boxes containing film reels and<br />\nvideocassettes- the. front of each displa% in:: a color still<br />\nfrom the enclosed movie, apparently repicentative of<br />\nthe work as a whole. They are grouped b) genre: anal,<br />\noral, two men and a woman, two women and a man,<br />\noutright orgies, gay males, lesbians, twin sisters, interracial, with animals, on motorcycles. etc., etc.... the list<br />\ngois on and on. The titles of these epics are less than<br />\nmemorable. The price is $75.00 a piece, no pun intended.<br /><br />\nact Or Fantasy<br /><br />\ns Baldridge<br />\ny David Newman<br /><br />\nAlong the final wall are the sex novelties. The<br />\nparticular establishment we were patronizing carried the<br />\ncompete line of Doc Johnson's\" Marital Aids.\" These<br />\nrubber reproductions of male and female organs, doggie<br />\nchew-toys at first glance. but a closer inspection reveals<br />\nthe careful attempt to simulate nature's originals in<br />\nplastic and paint. An analogy might be drawn between<br />\nthis and The Block as a whole, but I will certainly not be<br />\nSO foolhardy as to attempt it. The stern, authoritative<br />\nreproduction of Doc Johnson stands above the entire<br />\ndisplay. resplendant in his starched lab coat and dangling<br />\nstethoscope. His stern features seem to warn the drooling wino and the scoffing college boy not to take his<br />\nhumanitarian and professional commitment to sexual<br />\ntherapy lightly, for the Doc is a dedicated man. He<br />\nprobably went to Hopkins.<br />\nA doorway at the back leads to a long corridor<br />\nlined with quarter-a-shot movie booths. Upon entering,<br />\nthe megawatt brightness immediately eases, being<br />\nreplaced by the soft illumination of red-painted lightbulbs -- the kind of lighting we were always told to<br />\nexpect. You simply pick one of the numbered booths,<br />\nstep inside-, and drop two bits into the machine. The<br />\nmovie begins immediately, being projected from a<br />\nhidden recess above and behind your head. I felt like<br />\nJim Phelps on 'Mission Impossible.' After about thirty<br />\nsecond, just when something interesting is about to<br />\nhappen, the projector ceases whirring and you're left<br />\nstaring at the No Loitering sign on the door. Another<br />\nquarter and the action begins anew, only to abruptly<br />\nhalt once more on the verge of an insertion. an orgasm,<br />\nor the introduction of a whip. The movies themselves<br />\nare pretty standard stuff, but I must admit to becoming<br />\nfascinated with the timing of the things. Whoever edited<br />\nthose cinematic classics managed to include a dozen<br />\nframes of real interest every thirty seconds. It's the<br />\nmental version of eating Doritos \u2014 you always have to<br />\nhave just one more.<br />\nThe atmosphere in the show bars is quite different, but the routine is just as predictable and inflexible.<br />\nAs the disco begins to blare, a woman climbs the three<br />\nsteps up to the bartop, her white pumps glowing in the<br />\nblacklight. Once there, she begins dancing with, all the<br />\nenthusiasm of a narcoleptic. In a nighty for the first<br />\nsong, topless for the second,and nakei for the third, she<br />\ngoes about her business like an automaton. To say that<br />\nthese women look bored is akin to calling Marty Bass<br />\nobnoxious --a laughable understatement. They seem to<br />\nbe somewhere else entirely, rocking back and forth as<br />\nthey arrange grocery lists or tally up tips in their heads.<br />\nSome are ugly, others quite pretty, but all are distant.<br />\nThere is no question of physical contact -- these women<br /><br />\nperform their tired routines well out of the customers'<br />\nreach, a line of whiskey bottles standing guard on the<br />\nilluminated bar shelf at their feet.<br />\nDown on ground level, another set routine is<br />\nperformed. The bar girls, decked out in backless dresses<br />\nor hot pants,bend over the seated patrons to whisper:<br />\n\"Looking for some company, hon?\" An affirmative<br />\nanswer brings a smile, the pressure of a hand on your<br />\nforearm, and the soft request: \"Why don't you buy me<br />\na drink?\" A negative reply gets you a \"Cheap bastard!\"<br />\nand an extremely withering look.<br />\nThe standard procedure is simple. When you<br />\nadopt a bar girl, the first drink is $3, the second $10, and<br />\nso on until the proper amount has changed hands. This<br />\npractice avoids legal troubles, as well as allowing the<br />\nwomen to screen out the more obvious psychos before<br />\nany doors are closed.<br />\nOur drinks finished, we spill out into the street<br />\nand head for another bar. The barkers' speeches are also<br />\nnearly identical, their sharp words being fired machinegun fashion at the passing suckers. \"C'mon in, c'mon in.<br />\nFree look guys have a free look hey guys don't cheat<br />\nyourselves hey CHECKITOUT!\" No matter what bar we around it wherever possible, like a death in the family<br />\nenter, the pattern is identical. They really have but one that one tactfully tries to avoid. As a result, I received<br />\nitem to peddle, and no one sees any reason to change so precious little hard information about the inner worksuccessful a marketing technique.<br />\nings of The Block. To wit: the girls make $175 a week<br />\nThere was one departure from the standard on paper and business of late has been bad.<br />\nscenario, however. For reasons which weren't clear at<br />\nLynda was worried about her prospects for the<br />\nthe time, I got into an extended conversation with future. \"It's like pro football.\" she complained. \"Once<br />\none of the bar girls for the price of merely a single drink. you get too much over 30, your merchandise ain't so<br />\nShe opened up and began telling me about her past, and saleable no more.\" She was planning to take the GED<br />\nwhat life was like for the bar girls.<br />\ntest soon and leave the show bars forever.

The disco was as occurs at The Block, but I really can't. There's just too<br />\nloud as ever, but she didn't even make a pretense of much sadness down there of all kinds, too much pain on<br />\ndancing. Rather, she just walked up and down the length<br />\nthe lonely faces of both sexes for any of us vs. them<br />\nof the platform, vaguely in step with the beat. She was explanation to make much sense. Other folks might<br />\nof the \"Old School.\" Earlier, she had confessed to me safeguard their feelings of moral superiority by claiming<br />\nthat she was 36, and that \"competin' with the younger that The Block divorces sex from emotion...these people<br />\ngirls ain't easy.\" Her veteran's status was apparent from<br />\nought to visit the Rat. After years of stumbling through<br />\nwhere I sat -- the pot belly and sags were quite noticea- the ruin we young lions have made of such things as<br />\nble, and all in all her body was not of the voluptuous love, honor , and simple consideration, I can't help but<br />\nkind that the title \"exotic dancer\" usually implies.

Unfortunately, Mick, things in the real world are<br />\nseldom as good as they look on paper,<br />\nand sadly, Tusk is no exception. Many of<br />\nrock's greatest albums Who's Next,<br />\nAbbe;' Road, and Let It Bled, to name<br /><br />\nbut three - have been made when .the<br />\nband members have been at each others'<br />\nthroats. It seems that musicians respond<br />\nto peaceful, unexciting tranquil lives with<br />\npeaceful, unexciting and tranquil (read:<br />\nboring) albums.<br />\nTusk, which has the lofty list<br />\nprice of 515.98 (!) contains about eight<br />\nworthwhile songs. The problem is that<br />\nTusk is a double album, with a total of 20<br />\nsongs, and eight \"above average\" songs<br />\nout of 20 just does not cut the mustard.<br />\nWhy, why, why do musicians insist on<br />\nputting out mediocre double albums? A<br />\ntightly edited single album with the best<br />\nsongs on it would be infinitely more<br />\nimpressive. Rumor has it that 121!\u201dtwood<br /><br />\nMac was a bit embarrassed about taking<br />\nso long since Rumours, so they felt<br />\nobliged to make it seem worthwhile. If<br />\nthat was indeed their intention, they have<br />\nfailed miserably.<br />\nGuitarist Lindsey Buckingham<br />\nseems to have assumed the dominant role<br />\nthat Bob Welch formerly had with the<br />\nhand. But Buckingham seems to have<br />\nlost most or all of his compositional<br />\ntalents along with his hair. All of his<br />\nsongs on the new album have an extremely irritating jerkiness in the backing track<br />\nwhich does nothing to hide Buckingham's<br />\nandroidal singing.<br />\nChristine McVie and Stevie Nicks,<br />\nfor their part, contribute some impressive<br />\nworks; especially so are McVie's \"Brown<br />\nEyes\" and Nicks' \"Sara\" Both of these<br />\nrank favorably with anything the band<br />\nhas ever done. However, Nick's other<br />\ncompositions are almost unanimously<br />\noverlong and drawn out. While one<br />\ndoesn't notice that a song goes on for five<br />\nminutes if the melody is interesting, the<br />\nmelodies she has come up with are - well,<br />\nboring. McVie's other works range from<br />\nmildly interesting(\"Think About Me\") to<br />\nutterly revolting (\"Honey Hi,\" an exercise in sugar-coating that will probably<br />\nclog your speakers given time).<br />\nThe fact that the Mac has hit such<br />\ncont, on p. 19<br /><br />\nEtron Fou Leloublan, a trio of<br />\nbass, saxophone, and percussion, played<br />\nMonday night in the L-V room, sponsored by the Fine Arts Committee.
