Md.<br />\n<br />\nTHE USELESSNESS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE<br />\nEXAMINATIONS<br />\nThe inefficacy of the very great majority of college examinations as indices of what a student gains from a course has been<br />\nasserted so many times that it is almost an axiom. There are few<br />\ninstructors who woudl maintain that they are capable of framing<br />\nan examination-which really does what it purports to do. Nevertheless, in the absence of any practical substitute, in large classes<br />\nparticularly, every American college has its two or three examination periods a year.<br />\nThe chances of giving a fair examination vary, however, in<br />\ndifferent courses. Dr. Barnett, .for example, is known to give a<br />\ncomprehensive examination which is usually a good gauge of the<br />\nstudent's mastery of the subject. In the subjects he teaches it<br />\nseems to be possible to do this, and moreover; to grade the students<br />\nwith accuracy.<br />\nIn certain other subjects, however, notably English Literature,<br />\nan examination which will really give the instructor an idea of the<br />\nstudent's knowledge and appreciation of the course is almost impossible. And if it is a difficult task to draw up an examination,<br />\nit is about fifty times that difficult to grade one. Is there any<br />\nman alive who believes that a professor of English Literature<br />\ncan determine whether a student's work merits an 8.0 or an 8.5?<br />\nOr.does anyone even believe, truthfully, that a professor can often<br />\ntell, from the result of quizzes and examinations, the difference<br />\nbetween a 7.0 and an 8.0, or an 8.0 and a 9.0? Yes, he can quote<br />\nsix words from a poem or a play and ask the student to identify<br />\nthe quoted line as to author, work, and context; either the student knows, or does not know. Or he can ask the student, on the<br />\nother hand, what a certain poet meant in a certain one of his<br />\nsonnets; if the poor student doesn't happen to remember that particular sonnet, down goes his mark! Again, there may be a<br />\nquestion on what Matthew Arnold thinks about Crabbe. One<br />\nof the most misleading questions, from the point of view of the<br />\npossible satisfactoriness of the answer, is the one which asks a<br />\nstudent to describe, often in detail, some lyrical poem, such as an<br />\nelegy, an ode, or a love lyric. It is perfectly obvious that the<br />\nquality of the answers to most such questions depends in a large<br />\ndegree upon two factors, neither of which is an accurate indication of the student's real appreciation of the literature he has<br />\nread. One is the retentiveness of the memory, and the other is<br />\nthe student's relative powers of articulation.<br />\nThe former is, logically, an anomaly. It is an accepted fact<br />\nthat many students are capable of remembering, for two or three<br />\ndays, details of a very large number of poems which they will<br />\nforget within a week after the examination. The latter objection<br />\ndepends upon what is to be recognized as the purpose of literature<br />\ncourses. If the purpose of a literature course be to awaken an<br />\ninterest in good literature by bringing the student into contact<br />\nwith it, the fact that he cannot express himself as glibly as his<br />\nclassmate does not indicate tha.t his appreciation is any the less.<br />\nAnd even if part of the purpose 'of such courses is to develop<br />\nliterary expression on the part of the student himself, making him<br />\nwrite down from memory the results of much cramming is hardly<br />\nthe way to accomplish the end.<br />\nIn the case of courses in English Literature there is a definite<br />\nalternate to an examination\u2014the term paper. Such papers,<br />\ncarefully outlined by the instructor so as to cover fully the scope<br />\nof the semester's work, would serve a far better purpose than an<br />\nexamination for which a student stuffs his head for a week in<br />\nadvance. The writing of a comprehensive paper would not only<br />\nmake the student much more familiar wth the literature itself, but<br />\nwould develop the student's powers of expression. He will remember much more as the result of this work than he will from having<br />\nstudied for an examination.<br />\nFew people will deny the validity of this argument. This is no<br />\nessay written for the purpose of filling space: we believe that<br />\nexaminations in English Literature are useless and unfair. We<br />\nbelieve that if the English Department should abolish examinations<br />\nat the end of the next semester and substitute in their place comprehensive term papers written under the general supervision of<br />\nthe instructors, the men taking literature courses will derive far<br />\ngreater benefit from those courses.

There are few<br />\ninstructors who woudl maintain that they are capable of framing<br />\nan examination-which really does what it purports to do. Nevertheless, in the absence of any practical substitute, in large classes<br />\nparticularly, every American college has its two or three examination periods a year.<br />\nThe chances of giving a fair examination vary, however, in<br />\ndifferent courses. Dr. Barnett, .for example, is known to give a<br />\ncomprehensive examination which is usually a good gauge of the<br />\nstudent's mastery of the subject. In the subjects he teaches it<br />\nseems to be possible to do this, and moreover; to grade the students<br />\nwith accuracy.<br />\nIn certain other subjects, however, notably English Literature,<br />\nan examination which will really give the instructor an idea of the<br />\nstudent's knowledge and appreciation of the course is almost impossible. And if it is a difficult task to draw up an examination,<br />\nit is about fifty times that difficult to grade one. Is there any<br />\nman alive who believes that a professor of English Literature<br />\ncan determine whether a student's work merits an 8.0 or an 8.5?<br />\nOr.does anyone even believe, truthfully, that a professor can often<br />\ntell, from the result of quizzes and examinations, the difference<br />\nbetween a 7.0 and an 8.0, or an 8.0 and a 9.0? Yes, he can quote<br />\nsix words from a poem or a play and ask the student to identify<br />\nthe quoted line as to author, work, and context; either the student knows, or does not know. Or he can ask the student, on the<br />\nother hand, what a certain poet meant in a certain one of his<br />\nsonnets; if the poor student doesn't happen to remember that particular sonnet, down goes his mark! Again, there may be a<br />\nquestion on what Matthew Arnold thinks about Crabbe. One<br />\nof the most misleading questions, from the point of view of the<br />\npossible satisfactoriness of the answer, is the one which asks a<br />\nstudent to describe, often in detail, some lyrical poem, such as an<br />\nelegy, an ode, or a love lyric. It is perfectly obvious that the<br />\nquality of the answers to most such questions depends in a large<br />\ndegree upon two factors, neither of which is an accurate indication of the student's real appreciation of the literature he has<br />\nread. One is the retentiveness of the memory, and the other is<br />\nthe student's relative powers of articulation.<br />\nThe former is, logically, an anomaly. It is an accepted fact<br />\nthat many students are capable of remembering, for two or three<br />\ndays, details of a very large number of poems which they will<br />\nforget within a week after the examination. The latter objection<br />\ndepends upon what is to be recognized as the purpose of literature<br />\ncourses. If the purpose of a literature course be to awaken an<br />\ninterest in good literature by bringing the student into contact<br />\nwith it, the fact that he cannot express himself as glibly as his<br />\nclassmate does not indicate tha.t his appreciation is any the less.<br />\nAnd even if part of the purpose 'of such courses is to develop<br />\nliterary expression on the part of the student himself, making him<br />\nwrite down from memory the results of much cramming is hardly<br />\nthe way to accomplish the end.<br />\nIn the case of courses in English Literature there is a definite<br />\nalternate to an examination\u2014the term paper. Such papers,<br />\ncarefully outlined by the instructor so as to cover fully the scope<br />\nof the semester's work, would serve a far better purpose than an<br />\nexamination for which a student stuffs his head for a week in<br />\nadvance. The writing of a comprehensive paper would not only<br />\nmake the student much more familiar wth the literature itself, but<br />\nwould develop the student's powers of expression. He will remember much more as the result of this work than he will from having<br />\nstudied for an examination.<br />\nFew people will deny the validity of this argument. This is no<br />\nessay written for the purpose of filling space: we believe that<br />\nexaminations in English Literature are useless and unfair. We<br />\nbelieve that if the English Department should abolish examinations<br />\nat the end of the next semester and substitute in their place comprehensive term papers written under the general supervision of<br />\nthe instructors, the men taking literature courses will derive far<br />\ngreater benefit from those courses. Why not give the scheme a<br />\ntry?<br /><br />\nHOPKINS POET HONORED<br /><br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE<br />\nNEWS<br />\nContrary to the usual opinions<br />\nadvanced by our demon statisticians,<br />\nthe comptroller of the University<br />\nof Southern California calmly informs us that only at that institution men require more money to go<br />\nto college than women.

In recreation and social activities the college<br />\nman takes first place, spending from<br />\n$75 to $500, while the woman's expenditure in this line. is only from<br />\n$25 to $75.<br />\n*<br /><br />\nzis a matter of interest to all fraternity men, there is at present a<br />\ncommittee of the National Conference of College Deans making a<br />\nsurvey of the fraternities and sororities over the country.
