Years ago the East<br />\nCoast offered a series of cultures<br />\nthat changed dramatically every<br />\nhundred miles or so. A voyager<br />\nfrom the bleak, oil-stained<br />\nlandscapes of North Jersey would<br />\nfind himself lost in a volley of<br />\nstrange slang and customs had he<br />\nthe nerve to travel as far as the<br />\nwoods of New Hampshire.<br />\nToday, however, the country is<br />\nfast becoming one culture with<br />\nthe same traditions instead of the<br />\n<br />\nunion of complementary<br />\nlife-styles it used to be.<br />\nThe one aspect of this<br />\noutdated differentiation that<br />\nlingers on is the pride a citizen<br />\ntakes in the food specialty of the<br />\nregion in which he lives. Witness<br />\nthe New Yorker who beams witlself-satisfaction when a foreigner<br />\nagrees that yes, there is nothing<br />\nlike a slice of pizza from the<br />\nMetropolitan area. Or the<br />\nresident of South Philly who<br />\ndefends his much maligned<br />\nterrain by touting the<br />\nexceptional hot pretzels that are<br />\nsold on the city's street corners<br />\nand parks.<br />\n<br />\nAnd from what everyone says,<br />\nBaltimore too, has cause to<br />\nconsider itself among the<br />\ngastronomic capitals of the<br />\ncountry. Something called<br />\nseafood. Not that anyone living<br />\nin the Homewood neighborhood<br />\nwould have any way of knowing<br />\nthis, save the reams of promo<br />\npamphlets and guides that tell<br />\nhim so. Sure, there's an<br />\noccasional restaurant in the area<br />\nthat serves a decent seafood dish,<br />\nbut the essence of the \"regional<br />\nspecialty\" is that it can be<br />\nbought anywhere;, from the<br />\nritziest'restaurant to the sleaziest<br />\nsidewalk stand.

This Crab and Oyster<br />\nHouse, located at 401 W. 29th<br />\nStreet, is a fitting example of the<br />\ntake-out business that deals<br />\nalmost exclusively in the<br />\n\"regional specialty.\"<br />\nBrom o Seltzer<br />\nSterling's has few pretensions.<br />\nIts cramped, somewhat dirty<br />\ninterior is hardly an<br />\nadvertisement for the<br />\nestablishment, yet seems<br />\npeculiarly appropriate. The walls<br />\nare decorated with racks of cheap<br />\nwine, Utz's cheese twirls and<br />\nrather flagrantly, a display of<br />\nBromo Seltzer. A faded poster is<br />\npasted unevenly on the cigarette<br />\nmachine and reads: \"Take the<br />\nnight train in December. No<br />\nticket necessary! Available soon<br />\nat this station.\" Glance from the<br />\nposter to an opposite shelf and a<br />\nbottle of Night Train Express will<br />\ntake your vision. That's if the<br />\nseventy-nine cents price sticker<br />\nbelow it doesn't grab you first.<br />\nThe limited counter space is<br />\ninevitably cluttered with cartons<br />\nand crab crates, but that won't<br />\nmatter since the stools are<br />\nuncomfortable at best.<br />\nBut Sterling's is never without<br />\n<br />\n^=3lean%WS=wslittS3v$112$53r4SRS7453151XISIZAMSYNii<br />\n<br />\ncustomers. Two men stand<br />\nbehind the counter, taking<br />\norders, gabbing with regulars and<br />\nfixing the popular fishcakes<br />\nwhich most people throw down<br />\nwhile waiting for their food. The<br />\nstream of patrons rarely slows<br />\ndown; you'll keep company with<br />\na changing set of faces.<br />\nThe seafood is cheap,<br />\nplentiful, and most importantly,<br />\nauthentic. Nowhere else can fried<br />\nclams be bought that are made<br />\nwith more clam than bread; the<br />\nclam chowder is chunky, filled<br />\nwith large clams and heavy on<br />\nthe seasoning.

Operating on a<br />\nlimited basis last year while the<br />\nsearch for faculty and the<br />\nrefurbishing of the third floor of<br />\nMaryland Hall were being carried<br />\nout, the department now boasts<br />\nfour full-time<br />\nprofessors. In<br />\naddition to Dr. Mintz, they<br />\ninclude Emily Ahern, Beatriz<br />\nL avandera<br />\n, and department<br />\nchairman Richard Price. The<br />\nUniversity seeks to raise the<br />\nnumber of faculty members to<br />\nsix through two further<br />\na ppointment<br />\ns.

A deceivingly packaged<br />\nalbum, it bears the outward<br />\nappearances of a supersession,<br />\nplastered as it is with the names<br />\nof John McLaughlin, Billy<br />\nCobham, Chick Corea, The<br />\nEleventh House, etc. But what it<br />\nreally is are some leftovers of the<br />\nsession McLaughlin et al. did<br />\nwith Coryell in 1969 (re-issued<br />\nearly last year with a new cover<br />\nas Spaces). The rest is remnants<br />\nof Eleventh House sessions<br />\nbefore Coryell won his court case<br />\nand the Arista Album (Level<br />\nOne) was released.<br />\nStill, outtakes can be<br />\ninteresting, as some recently<br />\nreleased Coltrane has proven. But<br />\nthis album proves the \"not<br />\nalways\" clause.<br />\nMost of it is dull, and even<br />\nmore poorly mastered than what<br />\nwas originally released. The only<br />\nsemi-interesting cut on the album<br />\nis an alternate version of Eyes of<br />\nLove, with an electric solo over<br />\ntracked against the acoustic<br />\nwork. Not successful, but<br />\ninteresting.<br />\nBasically, though, the whole<br />\nalbum is a rip-off, because you're<br />\n<br />\npromised so much and given so<br />\nlittle. Even the title cut, Planet<br />\nEnd is typical; a loud, boorish<br />\njam with McLaughlin, Corea,<br />\nCobham, and Miroslav Vitous.<br />\nFor my money, give me music,<br />\nnot trash.<br />\nGil Evans<br />\nThere Comes A Time<br />\nRCA<br />\nGil Evans is a self-taught<br />\ngenius, who has written for<br />\neveryone from Claude Thornhill<br />\nto Charlie Parker, and was<br />\ninstrumental as the arranger for<br />\nMiles Davis' Birth of the Cool,<br />\nPorgy and Bess (the best-selling<br />\njazz lp until Hancock's<br />\nHeadhunters), and Sketches of<br />\n<br />\nSpain. His writing was lush and<br />\ndense, and gave a sound of<br />\nextreme tastefulness to anY<br />\nsession.<br />\nToday, Evan's band sports no<br />\nless than three synthesizers, three<br />\ndrummers, and an array of some<br />\nof the best young talent in the<br />\nbusiness. This album features<br />\nTony Williams, Dave Sanborn,<br />\nBilly Harper, Howard Johnson.<br />\nHannibal, and Lew Soloff, to<br />\nname a few.<br />\nBut his album is more than a<br />\nparade of names. Evans uses the<br />\nelectronics to create a tonal<br />\nsurrealism in his band, a sense of<br />\njagged textures and brilliant<br />\ncolors. ,<br />\n<br />\n\"Miracle Worker\"<br />\nTo open tonight<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\nWhile watching last evening's<br />\nfinal dress rehearsal of the<br />\nBarnstormers' production of<br />\n\"The Miracle Worker\", my mind<br />\ncoudn't help but wander back to<br />\nmy high school days when Helen<br />\nKeller jokes were the coming fad.<br />\nThese jokes (none of which are<br />\ntasteful enough to mention here)<br />\nwere designed to cut down the<br />\npompous sentimentality<br />\nsurrounding the myth of Helen<br />\nKeller. Perhaps the biggest single<br />\nfactor in perpetuating the myth<br />\nwas William Gibson's play, \"The<br />\nMiracle Worker\" which is mired<br />\nby sentimentality.<br />\nBy now, I suppose, the<br />\nheartrending story of how Anne<br />\nSullivan, overcoming her own<br />\nblindness, taught the enfant<br />\nterrible Helen Keller to surmount<br />\nher own tremendous handicaps,<br />\nhas become instilled as a<br />\npermanent American parable that<br />\nhard work and understanding can<br />\novercome anything. If nothing<br />\nelse, this play disproves the old<br />\nadage that the blind leading the<br />\nblind can't possibly be<br />\nproductive.<br />\nFortunately the Barnstormers<br />\nproduction seems to transcent<br />\nthe play's inherent weaknesses.<br />\nJohn Piroman's dynamic<br />\ndirection makes good use of the<br />\nListening-Viewing Room's<br />\ncramped stage; never lets the<br />\nplay's action become too slow or<br />\n<br />\ntoo fast. He has also directed the<br />\ncast ably, allowing each player to<br />\ndevelop within his own<br />\ncapabilities the needed<br />\ncharacterization. The lighting was<br />\ncreative and the period costumes<br />\nwere adequately quaint.<br />\nAs Anne Sullivan, Caroline<br />\nObrecht is definitely the star of<br />\nthe show. She acts subdued and<br />\nintelligently, her vocal and facial<br />\nexpressions are exactly what one<br />\nexpects. Caren Fleit is given a<br />\nchance to show off in the part of<br />\nHelen and does reasonably well<br />\nin cavorting wildly about the<br />\nstage. Ruth Bosch fits<br />\ncomfortably into the role of<br />\nAunt Ev, the stereotypical<br />\nmeddling dowager. The only<br />\nregrettable performance was<br />\nJohn Bloomenthal as Captain<br />\nKeller, the stubborn head of the<br />\nhousehold. Mr. Bloomenthal's<br />\nperformance contained far too<br />\nmuch cornpone as his overblown<br />\nsouthern accent and stiff manner<br />\nthreatened to overwhelm the rest<br />\nof the cast.<br />\nPerhaps the most distressing<br />\nnote is no fault of the<br />\nBarnstormers. The ListeningViewing Room is an inefficient<br />\ntheatre. The walls are se thin all<br />\nthe racket from the Rathskellar's<br />\n\"Disco Night\" provided crass<br />\nbackground music. Perhaps,<br />\nhope, some arrangements will be<br />\nmade to correct this deplorable<br />\nsituation.<br />\n<br />\n\fjantiary 30, 1976/news-letter/page 5<br />\n<br />\n\"IT CAN BE SAID SIMPLY AND WITH THANKS!<br />\nTHAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC MOVIE\"<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nN iANA ROSS /*<br />\nB IE HOLI0 \u2022<br />\n..,,<br />\n<br />\nJay Cocks<br />\nTime Magazine<br />\n<br />\nhas regrettably<br />\nbeen<br />\ncancelled<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nGS I E<br />\n.41 '<br />\n:LUES<br />\nc1<br />\nk<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n:<br />\n,<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n..<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\ni<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.I<br />\n,<br />\n.....<br />\n,<br />\ntra<br />\nSi,<br />\n..,in its place we will present<br />\n<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n`-\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n\u2022.<br />\n<br />\n:'''') .'<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n.toolfr<br />\n<br />\nThere's a little bit of<br />\nDuddy Kravitz In everyone.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nAT=NOTONINFFilm<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nN..,<br />\n<br />\nTOOK APPIRENTICNISO1110OF<br />\n<br />\n..<br />\nMIDDY Kamm<br />\nT.. . .<br />\n..,<br />\n.......,:.<br />\n,,,s COLO.<br />\n<br />\n.,<br />\nBi<br />\n<br />\n5P \u2022AD./*LAD<br />\nr.D.<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\ni,<br />\n<br />\nFri. & Sat 1/30 & 1/31 7.30 & 10.00<br />\nseniors . $.75<br />\nI<br />\nSchaffer 3<br />\n<br />\nMUSKETEE125<br />\n<br />\nTHE THREE<br />\n<br />\n.N.,<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nOLIVER REED \u2022 RAQUEL WELCH- RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN 'And MICHAEL YORK.omo,..<br />\nFRANK FINLAY CHRISTOPHER LEE GERALDINE CHAPLIN<br />\n.., CHARLTON HESTON,.o.chnco Rich\u00ab. /<br />\nipGI -.SIMON WARD..\u2039,FAYE DUNAWAY.0o<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nall others $1.00<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Da owl by CIADMMAS twohous 0,11\u20221 NOKIA.

Row<br />\nhouses, apartment buildings,<br />\nWolman, the dorms\u2014all are<br />\nleased on some sort of rental<br />\npayment basis. Students seldom<br />\nlook into buying a house in the<br />\nHopkins area, which offers the<br />\nstudent two big advantages: first,<br />\na house will give students more<br />\nroom and convenience, and,<br />\nmore importantly, payment will<br />\nbe on a mortgage basis. The<br />\nsecond difference means that<br />\nstudents will be able to get back<br />\nthe majority of their money paid<br />\non the mortgage through resale<br />\nof the house.<br />\nThe amount of money that<br />\ncan be saved through buying a<br />\nhouse is substantial. If you<br />\nfigured to pay $70 a month rent<br />\non an apartment or house over 3<br />\nyears, the total rent paid would<br />\nbe $2520. All you would have to<br />\nshow for it would be cancelled<br />\nchecks. If that $2520 was put<br />\ntowards a mortgage, the amount<br />\ngotten back through resale<br />\nshould be no less than $2000,<br />\nwith the likelihood that the<br />\nentire $2520 could be recouped<br />\nthrough inflation and regular<br />\nmaintenance of the house.<br />\nFigures obtained from a local<br />\nreal estate agent suggest that<br />\nbuying a house in the Hopkins<br />\narea would be feasible.

So often students prefer<br />\nto skim by, hearing or reading<br />\nonly as much as needed to<br />\ndiscern the thesis of the book or<br />\nlecture, jot it down, and be ready<br />\nto parrot it back on the following<br />\nexam or paper. It is not<br />\nsurprising that this malaise of<br />\npassivity is so widespread. For<br />\none !thing, it . is less costly. both<br />\nin terms of effort and time<br />\nspent, and, for another,<br />\nunquestionable acceptance of<br />\nwhat is taught often results in a<br />\n\"safe\" route to a high grade.<br />\nThere is a danger in .challenging<br />\nwhat we learn. It is natural for<br />\nfigures of authority, in this case<br />\nprofessors, to discourage efforts<br />\nto question the knowledge that<br />\nassures that authority. This<br />\ndiscouragement can even extend<br />\nas far as awarding a lower grade<br />\nto a student. Yet along with the<br />\ndangers come blessings; the<br />\nexuberance one experiences<br />\nwhen thinking in an independent<br />\nand creative manner, the<br />\nliberating feeling of seeing<br />\nanother and yet another<br />\nviewpoint, and, yos, downright<br />\nfreedom to explore a wide range<br />\nof intellectual possibilities.<br />\nIn the final ;Analysis, the<br />\nyearning for a challenging and<br />\nfresh university learning<br />\nexperience may prove to be<br />\nunimportant or even useless. As<br />\nJoseph Heller shows in<br />\nSomething HaPPened in today's<br />\nsociety it is often not what one<br />\n'knows that counts, but rather<br />\nhow non-controversial, smooth,<br />\nand agreeable one can be. On the<br />\nother hand, I may be wrong<br />\nabout the who le situation-maybe students really do want to<br />\nlearn and question and maybe .<br />\nwhat you know really does<br />\ncount.<br />\nMark' Hertsgaard<br />\nIono. 4iim. 41me.<br />\n<br />\niani. owe.

Years ago the East<br />\nCoast offered a series of cultures<br />\nthat changed dramatically every<br />\nhundred miles or so. A voyager<br />\nfrom the bleak, oil-stained<br />\nlandscapes of North Jersey would<br />\nfind himself lost in a volley of<br />\nstrange slang and customs had he<br />\nthe nerve to travel as far as the<br />\nwoods of New Hampshire.<br />\nToday, however, the country is<br />\nfast becoming one culture with<br />\nthe same traditions instead of the<br /><br />\nunion of complementary<br />\nlife-styles it used to be.<br />\nThe one aspect of this<br />\noutdated differentiation that<br />\nlingers on is the pride a citizen<br />\ntakes in the food specialty of the<br />\nregion in which he lives. Witness<br />\nthe New Yorker who beams witlself-satisfaction when a foreigner<br />\nagrees that yes, there is nothing<br />\nlike a slice of pizza from the<br />\nMetropolitan area. Or the<br />\nresident of South Philly who<br />\ndefends his much maligned<br />\nterrain by touting the<br />\nexceptional hot pretzels that are<br />\nsold on the city's street corners<br />\nand parks.<br /><br />\nAnd from what everyone says,<br />\nBaltimore too, has cause to<br />\nconsider itself among the<br />\ngastronomic capitals of the<br />\ncountry. Something called<br />\nseafood. Not that anyone living<br />\nin the Homewood neighborhood<br />\nwould have any way of knowing<br />\nthis, save the reams of promo<br />\npamphlets and guides that tell<br />\nhim so. Sure, there's an<br />\noccasional restaurant in the area<br />\nthat serves a decent seafood dish,<br />\nbut the essence of the \"regional<br />\nspecialty\" is that it can be<br />\nbought anywhere;, from the<br />\nritziest'restaurant to the sleaziest<br />\nsidewalk stand. With one<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022,.<br /><br />\n5.<br /><br />\no.&gt;<br /><br />\n0<br />\n.7g<br />\nz<br /><br />\nexception this phenomenon is<br />\nabsent from the Homewood<br />\nCommunity.<br />\nAs they say in the<br />\nHampden -Remington<br />\nneighborhood, thank God for<br />\nSterling's! This Crab and Oyster<br />\nHouse, located at 401 W. 29th<br />\nStreet, is a fitting example of the<br />\ntake-out business that deals<br />\nalmost exclusively in the<br />\n\"regional specialty.\"<br />\nBrom o Seltzer<br />\nSterling's has few pretensions.<br />\nIts cramped, somewhat dirty<br />\ninterior is hardly an<br />\nadvertisement for the<br />\nestablishment, yet seems<br />\npeculiarly appropriate. The walls<br />\nare decorated with racks of cheap<br />\nwine, Utz's cheese twirls and<br />\nrather flagrantly, a display of<br />\nBromo Seltzer.

Anthropology courses<br />\nhad previously<br />\nbeen offered by<br />\nthe Social Relations<br />\ndepartment,<br />\nbut in 1973 the<br />\ndecision was<br />\nmade to give full department<br />\nstatus to what faculty<br />\nmember<br />\nSidney W. Mintz calls \"the<br />\nmost<br />\nhuman of the sciences and<br />\nthe<br />\nmost scientific of<br />\nthe<br />\nIi u<br />\nmanities\". Operating on a<br />\nlimited basis last year while the<br />\nsearch for faculty and the<br />\nrefurbishing of the third floor of<br />\nMaryland Hall were being carried<br />\nout, the department now boasts<br />\nfour full-time<br />\nprofessors. In<br />\naddition to Dr. Mintz, they<br />\ninclude Emily Ahern, Beatriz<br />\nL avandera<br />\n, and department<br />\nchairman Richard Price. The<br />\nUniversity seeks to raise the<br />\nnumber of faculty members to<br />\nsix through two further<br />\na ppointment<br />\ns.

His writing was lush and<br />\ndense, and gave a sound of<br />\nextreme tastefulness to anY<br />\nsession.<br />\nToday, Evan's band sports no<br />\nless than three synthesizers, three<br />\ndrummers, and an array of some<br />\nof the best young talent in the<br />\nbusiness. This album features<br />\nTony Williams, Dave Sanborn,<br />\nBilly Harper, Howard Johnson.<br />\nHannibal, and Lew Soloff, to<br />\nname a few.<br />\nBut his album is more than a<br />\nparade of names. Evans uses the<br />\nelectronics to create a tonal<br />\nsurrealism in his band, a sense of<br />\njagged textures and brilliant<br />\ncolors. ,<br /><br />\n\"Miracle Worker\"<br />\nTo open tonight<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\nWhile watching last evening's<br />\nfinal dress rehearsal of the<br />\nBarnstormers' production of<br />\n\"The Miracle Worker\", my mind<br />\ncoudn't help but wander back to<br />\nmy high school days when Helen<br />\nKeller jokes were the coming fad.<br />\nThese jokes (none of which are<br />\ntasteful enough to mention here)<br />\nwere designed to cut down the<br />\npompous sentimentality<br />\nsurrounding the myth of Helen<br />\nKeller. Perhaps the biggest single<br />\nfactor in perpetuating the myth<br />\nwas William Gibson's play, \"The<br />\nMiracle Worker\" which is mired<br />\nby sentimentality.<br />\nBy now, I suppose, the<br />\nheartrending story of how Anne<br />\nSullivan, overcoming her own<br />\nblindness, taught the enfant<br />\nterrible Helen Keller to surmount<br />\nher own tremendous handicaps,<br />\nhas become instilled as a<br />\npermanent American parable that<br />\nhard work and understanding can<br />\novercome anything. If nothing<br />\nelse, this play disproves the old<br />\nadage that the blind leading the<br />\nblind can't possibly be<br />\nproductive.<br />\nFortunately the Barnstormers<br />\nproduction seems to transcent<br />\nthe play's inherent weaknesses.<br />\nJohn Piroman's dynamic<br />\ndirection makes good use of the<br />\nListening-Viewing Room's<br />\ncramped stage; never lets the<br />\nplay's action become too slow or<br /><br />\ntoo fast. He has also directed the<br />\ncast ably, allowing each player to<br />\ndevelop within his own<br />\ncapabilities the needed<br />\ncharacterization. The lighting was<br />\ncreative and the period costumes<br />\nwere adequately quaint.<br />\nAs Anne Sullivan, Caroline<br />\nObrecht is definitely the star of<br />\nthe show. She acts subdued and<br />\nintelligently, her vocal and facial<br />\nexpressions are exactly what one<br />\nexpects. Caren Fleit is given a<br />\nchance to show off in the part of<br />\nHelen and does reasonably well<br />\nin cavorting wildly about the<br />\nstage. Ruth Bosch fits<br />\ncomfortably into the role of<br />\nAunt Ev, the stereotypical<br />\nmeddling dowager. The only<br />\nregrettable performance was<br />\nJohn Bloomenthal as Captain<br />\nKeller, the stubborn head of the<br />\nhousehold. Mr. Bloomenthal's<br />\nperformance contained far too<br />\nmuch cornpone as his overblown<br />\nsouthern accent and stiff manner<br />\nthreatened to overwhelm the rest<br />\nof the cast.<br />\nPerhaps the most distressing<br />\nnote is no fault of the<br />\nBarnstormers.

But the laws stand firm.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThis spring Hopkins students,<br />\nparticularly freshmen, will be out<br />\nlooking for a place to live for<br />\ntheir coming days in Baltimore.<br />\nThe type of housing that students<br />\noverwhelmingly choose each year<br />\nto live in are rental units. Row<br />\nhouses, apartment buildings,<br />\nWolman, the dorms\u2014all are<br />\nleased on some sort of rental<br />\npayment basis. Students seldom<br />\nlook into buying a house in the<br />\nHopkins area, which offers the<br />\nstudent two big advantages: first,<br />\na house will give students more<br />\nroom and convenience, and,<br />\nmore importantly, payment will<br />\nbe on a mortgage basis. The<br />\nsecond difference means that<br />\nstudents will be able to get back<br />\nthe majority of their money paid<br />\non the mortgage through resale<br />\nof the house.<br />\nThe amount of money that<br />\ncan be saved through buying a<br />\nhouse is substantial. If you<br />\nfigured to pay $70 a month rent<br />\non an apartment or house over 3<br />\nyears, the total rent paid would<br />\nbe $2520. All you would have to<br />\nshow for it would be cancelled<br />\nchecks. If that $2520 was put<br />\ntowards a mortgage, the amount<br />\ngotten back through resale<br />\nshould be no less than $2000,<br />\nwith the likelihood that the<br />\nentire $2520 could be recouped<br />\nthrough inflation and regular<br />\nmaintenance of the house.<br />\nFigures obtained from a local<br />\nreal estate agent suggest that<br />\nbuying a house in the Hopkins<br />\narea would be feasible. The<br />\nhomes in the area\u2014zip code area<br />\nI8\u2014range from $3800 to<br />\n$199,000 with the majority of<br /><br />\nthe houses falling in the<br />\nbracket.<br />\nA<br />\n$15,000-20,000<br />\nthirty-year mortgage on a<br />\n$15,000 at 81<br />\n/<br />\n2% interest would<br />\nrequire monthly payments of<br />\n$115.34.

Upgrading slightly from<br />\nthe figures for the $15,000<br />\nmortgage,<br />\ntotal<br />\nmonthly<br />\npayments would be around $180<br />\nor $60 per person. This cost is<br />\nabout a hundred dollars per<br />\nmonth less than if a comparable<br />\nhouse is rented, and substantially<br />\nlower than many apartments in<br />\nthe \"student ghetto.\"<br />\nThe only problem to all<br />\nthis\u2014getting<br />\na<br />\nmortgage\u2014is<br />\nsolvable. Parents can obtain<br />\nmortgages singly or on a joint basis<br />\nwith the parents of other<br />\nstudents. The closing costs would<br />\ncome to $800-$1000, and there<br />\nis a good chance that no down<br />\npayment would be required,<br />\naccording to the real estate agent.<br />\nThe initial investment would be<br />\nlow while mortgage payments<br />\nwould be less than rental<br />\npayments.<br />\nHousing in the area is available<br />\nand other parts of Baltimore<br />\ncould be looked into.

The<br />\nPolarity is complete. Miss Evil's<br />\nattire could fit in any one of his<br />\nPockets. A filmy black T-shirt<br />\ncovers what will become the next<br />\nshow on the mirrored stage, six<br />\nfeet away, on the other side of<br />\nthe bar. Maybe she's wearing<br />\nPanties, maybe not. A billie<br />\nblonde shag, heavy eye-makeup,<br />\na forearm tatoo and a Pall Mall<br />\nheighten the effect. Dad seems<br />\ninterested, his right hand<br />\nsmoothly cups what is closest.<br />\nThey approach from the right,<br />\nalways. She slides into his lap and<br />\ncoyly whispers something into<br />\nhis right ear. Effortlessly a seven<br />\nounce bottle of Malt Duck<br />\nappears and an easy five dollars<br />\ndisappears. This entitled Dad to a<br />\nlittle more \"conversation.\" My<br />\nfunction, as the observer, is<br />\ndistributed between the stage<br />\nshow and the drama at the bar. I<br />\ncan watch both, the mirror<br />\nallows me to stare directly at the<br />\nclientele, discreetly.<br />\nI am pitting on a show of my<br />\nown, trying to make it appear<br />\nthat I'm drinking my two dollar<br />\nBoh everytime the bartender<br />\nPasses. There's no cover, so<br />\nyou're discouraged from sitting<br />\non your beer. I've been cradling<br />\nit for forty five minutes now,<br />\nWhich is not an easy task. Dad and<br />\nMiss Evil are drawing closer, if<br />\nthat's possible in a public place.<br />\nHer right hand subtly lands on<br />\nwhat is closest. He's going to be<br /><br />\neasy, a real sugar daddy. They get<br />\nup in unison, swim through the<br />\ncrowd toward the dark<br />\nunfathomable recesses in the<br />\nrear, walk right past the<br />\nbathroom and fade into the<br />\ndimness. The stool at my right is<br />\nnow vacant, now quickly filled<br />\nby myself. You've got to keep<br />\nmoving down and in and to the<br />\nright to gain a more central<br />\nvantage point of the stage.<br />\nThe show grinds on. Miss Evil's<br />\nabsence is noticed only by the<br />\nbartender, he makes a note on his<br />\nclipboard, a scarred veteran<br />\nreplaces her in the rotation. The<br />\n\"dancers\" tonight have been<br />\nbelow par, we keep hanging on<br />\nhoping that out of the ten or so<br />\nwe'll be able to catch a Miss Evil,<br />\nall for the price of a beer.<br />\nDiplomatic<br />\nIt's not that everyone doesn't<br />\nget their chance. The women are<br />\ndiplomatic; they proceed down<br />\nthe length of the bar stopping to<br />\noffer their services to anyone<br />\nthat occupies a seat. Their lines<br />\nare consistently the same from<br />\npatron to patron and they're<br />\ncareful not to waste any effort<br />\nby stopping at the'same dead-end<br />\ntwice. The bartenders point out<br />\nperspectives. You've got to have<br />\nthe bucks, though. Unless you've<br />\nreally got the moves she'll come<br />\nand go before you've checked your<br />\nwallet. The best approach is to<br />\nsmoothly respond that yes, you<br />\nwould like some company while<br />\ndeftly swinging your arm around<br />\nher waist. Then, when asked 'to<br />\ncome through with a drink,<br />\nsimply say, \"I'd love to, but I<br />\nain't got the bucks.\" Whether she<br />\nbelieves you or not, she'll ask for<br />\na quarter for the jukebox and flit<br />\naway to spread the bad word to<br />\nher fellow employees.

So often students prefer<br />\nto skim by, hearing or reading<br />\nonly as much as needed to<br />\ndiscern the thesis of the book or<br />\nlecture, jot it down, and be ready<br />\nto parrot it back on the following<br />\nexam or paper. It is not<br />\nsurprising that this malaise of<br />\npassivity is so widespread. For<br />\none !thing, it . is less costly. both<br />\nin terms of effort and time<br />\nspent, and, for another,<br />\nunquestionable acceptance of<br />\nwhat is taught often results in a<br />\n\"safe\" route to a high grade.<br />\nThere is a danger in .challenging<br />\nwhat we learn. It is natural for<br />\nfigures of authority, in this case<br />\nprofessors, to discourage efforts<br />\nto question the knowledge that<br />\nassures that authority. This<br />\ndiscouragement can even extend<br />\nas far as awarding a lower grade<br />\nto a student. Yet along with the<br />\ndangers come blessings; the<br />\nexuberance one experiences<br />\nwhen thinking in an independent<br />\nand creative manner, the<br />\nliberating feeling of seeing<br />\nanother and yet another<br />\nviewpoint, and, yos, downright<br />\nfreedom to explore a wide range<br />\nof intellectual possibilities.<br />\nIn the final ;Analysis, the<br />\nyearning for a challenging and<br />\nfresh university learning<br />\nexperience may prove to be<br />\nunimportant or even useless. As<br />\nJoseph Heller shows in<br />\nSomething HaPPened in today's<br />\nsociety it is often not what one<br />\n'knows that counts, but rather<br />\nhow non-controversial, smooth,<br />\nand agreeable one can be. On the<br />\nother hand, I may be wrong<br />\nabout the who le situation-maybe students really do want to<br />\nlearn and question and maybe .<br />\nwhat you know really does<br />\ncount.<br />\nMark' Hertsgaard<br />\nIono. 4iim. 41me.<br /><br />\niani. owe.
