Presently, WJHU-AM is<br />\nlicensed to broadcast only within the<br />\ndormitory area with the option of<br />\nhaving telephone connections to<br />\nneighboring houses.<br />\nBilgrave sent a memorandum to<br />\nPresident Gordon February 17<br />\nexplaining his cvaluation of WJHU's<br />\nrequest. Bilgrave, while praising the staff<br />\nand the general operation on the<br />\nstudent station said \"the station was not<br />\nready\"for FM operation. He cited the<br />\nhigh cost for the new radio facilities, the<br />\ninexperience of the staff and the dearth<br />\nof student FM receivers.<br />\nStation manager Ewalt said<br />\nBilgrave's objections were unfounded.<br />\n\"We can train the people,\" he replied to<br />\nthe second Bilgrave objection, and he<br />\nrejected the first contention as<br />\nnearsighted. \"This(FM broadcasting) is<br />\nthe chance for us to get out and do<br />\nsomething instead of the fun-and-games<br />\ntype of operation we have now. We can<br />\nre-broadcast sports, campus lectures and<br />\nother worthwhile Hopkins activities.<br />\nThis will give us a totally different<br />\nconcept of running a station and it<br />\nwould affect, with this year's staff I'm<br />\nsure a favorable effect, Hopkins' image<br />\nto the Greater Baltimore community.\"<br />\nThe newly-elected station manager for<br />\nnext year, Baird Thompson,agreed with<br />\nEwalt. \"If we could do this, there would<br />\nbe a voice for the Hopkins community<br />\nin Baltimore,\" he said.<br />\n2 Month Wait<br />\n/<br />\n11<br />\nJohn Ewalt stated that after the<br />\nBilgrave letter in February, he tried to<br />\nget an appointment with Dr. Gordon to<br />\n2<br />\n/<br />\ndiscuss the FM proposals. After a 11<br />\nmonth wait, Gordon met with the<br />\nWJHU Board of Control in their<br />\n<br />\ndormitory radio room. Ewalt said he<br />\nalso invited Plant Manager Wes Taylor<br />\nto the itiformal meeting. Taylor, he<br />\nstated, casually mentioned in the<br />\ndiscussions that WJHU's request \"was<br />\nnot a high priority item,\" meaning,<br />\nEwalt said, it was being discarded.<br />\n\"Bilgrave hadn't told me about it<br />\nbeing scrapped, Ewalt asserted, \"He<br />\nprobably thought let it ride' since I'm a<br />\nsenior and will soon be gone.\" However,<br />\nEwalt and Thompson said that Gordon<br />\nasked Taylor for a reevaluation of the<br />\nstatiorrs request. \"Gordon was<br />\nsomewhat nebulous on his stand on the<br />\nmatter, although he seemed impressed<br />\nwith our operation,\" claimed Ewalt,<br />\n\"Taylor was asked by Gordon who did<br />\nthe recommending, but Taylor wouldn't \u2022<br />\nmention names and just said that other<br />\nstudent projects were more important.\"<br />\nBilgrave Replies<br />\nThe Director of Student Affairs<br />\nsaid that WJHU's request needs more<br />\ntime to be discussed. He cited his<br />\ntwo major objections to the project: the<br />\n$22,000 cost for the new outlay, and<br />\nthe question of who should run the<br />\nstation since it would be the university's<br />\nspokesman, \"Maybe this shouldn't be<br />\nrun by students, maybe the public<br />\nrelations department should run it. I<br />\ndon't know, it needs to be discussed,\"<br />\nBilgrave explained. He again said there<br />\nare other student activities which will be<br />\nof greater benefit for the students than<br />\nthe FM station.<br />\nEwalt agreed with Bilgrave's<br />\ncontention that the radio station has<br />\nnot been ignored by university subsidies<br />\nin the past. \"Two years ago our budget<br />\nwas $700 a year and its operation<br />\nreflected that,\" said Ewalt. The present<br />\nbudget allots $2,600 to WJHU. Ewalt<br />\nexplained this high figure reflected a<br />\nnumber of expensive capital<br />\nimprovements on the station this year.<br />\nThe value of the station's equipment (its<br />\nrecords are mainly free promotional<br />\ncopies) amounts to around $10,000.<br />\nDorm Listenership<br />\nIn return for this investment,<br />\nWJHU provides varied music programs<br />\nseven nights a week, plus Saturday and<br />\nSunday afternoon shows. Ewalt believed<br />\nthat about 70-75 per cent of the<br />\ndormitory residents listen to the campus<br />\nstation at least once a week. One of the<br />\ndisk jockeys,Steve Henderson, estimated<br />\nup to 35 per cent of the freshmen tune<br />\nin on an average night. Besides the<br />\ndorms, WJHU broadcasts, via telephone<br />\nconnections, to three fraternities, ZBT,<br />\nTEP and Sig Ep.<br />\nThis Monday Ewalt talked to<br />\nVice-President Ross Jones concerning<br />\nthe station's programming plan if they<br />\nreceive money to go FM. Ewalt said the<br />\nproposed station would mainly<br />\nbroadcast music with special programs<br />\ncovering Hopkins' events. \"He seemed<br />\nfavorable to our ideas; I think he will<br />\nrecommend us,\" Ewalt said.<br />\n<br />\nCramer Chosen New Dook<br />\n<br />\nCiting \"personal\" reasons,<br />\nNews-Letter editor Bruce Drake<br />\nresigned from the paper, effective<br />\nApril 24, 1969.

His grandfather, father, brothers and<br />\nhis wife's family all attended military schools. \"My<br />\nfamily is so ingrained in the military that I am suspect.<br />\nBut I am completely faithful and obedient to our<br />\ncountry,\" he said. \"I wouldn't support any Army<br />\ntakeover foolishness in the name of patriotism.\"<br />\nSlow Reform<br />\n\"Reform would have been carried out anyway,\"<br />\nParmly replied in regard to the many student and faculty<br />\ndemands nation wide for liberalization of the ROTC<br />\nprogram. In 1964, he stated, the University of Ohio<br />\nrecommended to the Secretary of the Army a number of<br />\nreforms to \"relate ROTC of the 1960's with the<br />\nuniversity of the 1960's, having in view the coming<br />\ndecade.\" The Secretary of the Army rejected the Ohio<br />\nplan last Friday, Parmly said, but issued to the ROTC<br />\nCommanders a modified plan for cadet instruction.<br />\nCol. Parmly asserted that the Hopkins branch had<br />\nalready altered its program several years ago. There has<br />\nbeen a 25 per cent reduction in the hours recommended<br />\nfor cadet training, the commander observed. He<br />\nexplained the reduction reflected the higher quality of<br />\nteaching by professors at Homewood. Many of the cadet<br />\ncourses were scrapped, he stated, because they<br />\noverlapped university courses which were \"better<br />\ntaught.\" The Army now is emphasizing courses in<br />\ndiplomacy and foreign policy to its ROTC cadets,<br />\nParmly observed.<br />\nRotsy Relevancy<br />\nThere are three reasons ROTC is still relevant on<br />\nthe college campus, the Colonel stated.

Dean Papas, a worker at the<br />\nPeace Action Center, stated that there are no planned<br />\nactivities for the week. \"Like the Viet Cong, we'll strike<br />\nat unexpected places and unexpected times.\"<br />\n,<br />\nThe members of last week's theater production<br />\nleft Levering Hall at four o'clock and made their way to<br />\nthe ROTC drill field. Among the participants were \"Viet<br />\nCong,\" the \"Draft Board,\" \"Uncle Sam\" and Dean Papas<br />\ndressed as Lincoln Gordon.<br />\nIn acting out the play, the NUC attempted to<br />\nrepresent the ambivalent attitudes of the University<br />\ntowards both the Draft Boards and Viet Nam.\"Lincoln<br />\n,Gordon\" for example, was pictured as eating a small<br />\nbaby. When those who played students chanted,\"Why<br />\nare you eating Brazil?\" Gordon responded,\"It's a lesson<br />\nI learned when I was working for the government.\"<br />\nAs the play was being staged on the field, ROTC<br />\nCommanders marched their troops around the<br />\ndemonstrators, apparently oblivious to their presence.<br />\nLarry Dannels, Housemaster of Jennings and Platoon<br />\nSergeant of Alpha Company was one of the few to take<br />\nnotice. \"Let's continue to look good.

His second reason was<br />\nthat a university affiliation keeps the Army subordinate<br />\n, to civilian controls. \"If the intellectual community of<br />\nthe United States is going to influence its students of the<br />\n\u2022 officer's corp, then they can do it the best on their own<br />\ncampuses,\" he said.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nParmly stated that attempts to end ROTC<br />\nactivities on the campuses have met defeat in the<br />\nCongress. He believed this was \"because it (ROTC's<br />\n\u2022 removal) would be one of the final blocks to stop what<br />\nhas been freely-described as the 'military mind.' I thin tc I<br />\nam one of those they would say has a 'military mind.'\"<br />\nCol. Parmly also characterized the members<br />\nopposed to ROTC. \"We have individuals in our society<br />\nwhose personality is bent on sadism and not based on<br />\nmoral codes,\" he asserted. He furthermore stated,<br />\n\"When hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of<br />\nequipment has been damaged (at ROTC buildings) this is<br />\nserious in my book.\"<br />\nThe ROTC Commander said that \"If I was asked<br />\nto leave this building (by a student group), I would first<br />\nask for their authority.

The three page<br />\nletter delved into an analysis of why Hopkins should not<br />\nallow ROTC on campus, as well as expanding the<br />\ndemands from merely an exclusion of ROTC from the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe SDS demand of the abolition of ROTC went<br />\ninto more specifics than the NUC letter. It asked that<br />\n\"ROTC have no access to University facilities on any<br />\nbasis; that there be no contractual relation between the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University and the U.S. Army for the<br />\ntraining of officers on a curricular or extra-curricular<br />\nbasis and that students who are currently receiving<br />\nROTC scholarships be given equivalent Hopkins<br />\nUniversity scholarships.\"<br />\nBeyond the issue of ROTC on campus, the SDS<br />\nmoved into a general attack on all manifestations of the<br />\nmilitary on campus. This consisted of calling for the<br />\nabolition, in addition to ROTC, of all \"military,<br />\ncounter-insurgency and pacification and social control<br />\nresearch.\"<br />\nSDS also called for the abolition of \"recruiting by<br />\nthe military and the Armed Services, by all<br />\nmilitary-connected Government Agencies, and by all<br />\nCorporations which produce war and social control<br />\nmaterial for use at home or abroad.\"<br />\nROTC Informers, NUC Claims<br />\nThe NUC had previously charged that ROTC men<br />\ncould \"be required to play the...informer role...,<br />\nconcerning beliefs and political associations of their<br />\nfellow students.\" Certain provisions of the U.

In<br />\nconjunction with a professor from Lehigh University,<br />\nDr. Hogan administered the California Psychological<br />\nInventory and a biographical questionnaire to 76<br />\nstudents from Hopkins and 72 from Lehigh.<br />\nAmong the conclusions presented in the paper is<br />\nthat \"users' and principled non-users are<br />\nindistinguishable in terms of extra-curricular activities,<br />\nyear in school or academic achievemen-t.\"<br />\nThe paper was presented at the conference of<br />\npsychologists in Philadelphia and was, in Dr. Hogan's<br />\nwords, \"extremely well received.\" The 76 Hopkins<br />\nstudents who were interviewed did not reveal their<br />\nidentities to the interviewers.

On the other hand, they also tend to be<br />\nimpulsive, pleasure-seeking and somewhat rebellious.\"<br />\nPrincipled non-users (a term which was only<br />\nrecently substituted for \"adamant non-users\") displayed<br />\nvery different .characteristics. They \"showed no clearly<br />\ndefined academic preferences, and were responsible and<br />\nrule-abiding. However, they also tended to be rigid,<br />\nconventional and narrow in their interests.\"<br />\nThe report also concluded that users and<br />\nprincipled non-users were virtually indistinguishable<br />\nfrom one another in terms of social maturity. Moreover,<br />\nboth groups appeared to be less than \"morally mature\"<br />\nwith regard to their performance on two indices<br />\ndesigned to predict moral behavior.<br />\nDr. Hogan's personal beliefs about users differ<br />\nfrom those which his data suggested.

However, little is actually<br />\nknown about the drug or its effects at<br />\nthis time.<br />\nOne of the reasons for the scarcity<br />\nof information is that reseachers have a<br />\ndifficult time obtaining high grade<br />\nmarijuana for testing purposes. To<br />\noffset this shortage, the government has<br />\nrecently stepped in and become the<br />\nlargest single producer of the drug in the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nAnother<br />\nproblem involved<br />\nin research of this<br />\nNEWS<br />\nkind is the lack of<br />\ncornmunication<br />\nbetween researchFEATURE<br />\ners investigating<br />\nthe drug from<br />\ndifferent angles.<br />\nSince biologists, pathologists,<br />\npsychologists, sociologists,<br />\npharmacologists and lawyers have<br />\nentered the field, there exists no<br />\nclearing-house for information which<br />\nsamples the findings from every field.<br />\n\"This is one of the<br />\nworst-researched areas known to man\"<br />\nsaid Dr. Sidney Cohen, chief of the<br />\nDivision of Narcotic Addiction and<br />\nDrug Abuse of the National Institute of<br />\nHealth, in Bethesda, Md.<br />\nThousands of Years<br />\nThe fact that so little is known<br />\nabout marijuana is surprising in light of<br />\nthe fact that records of its use\u2014for<br />\nmedicinal, religious or hedonistic<br />\nreasons\u2014have been ,found dating back<br />\nthousands of year's.<br />\n<br />\nThe reasons for the recent<br />\nincrease in the volume of research are<br />\nalso reasons for the scarcity of<br />\nknowledge about marijuana. Many more<br />\ngrants and much more equipment and<br />\nassistance is available now to the<br />\nscien tis t who wishes to explore<br />\nmarijuana's effects. It has been the<br />\ndiscovery of increased usage at colleges,<br />\nhigh schools and even junior high<br />\nschools, which has increased public<br />\nconcern and made resources more<br />\navailable to researchers.<br />\nHowever, the fact that public<br />\nopinion is so intimately connected with<br />\nthe present research is also a detrimental<br />\nfactor. Much of what is known, or<br />\nbelieved about the drug, comes from<br />\nattitudes developed out of superstition<br />\nor fear\u2014an attitude stemming all the<br />\nway back to America's puritan<br />\nbeginnings.<br />\nBiased Work Useless<br />\nAccording to Dr. Helen W.<br />\nNowlis, Professor of Psychology at the<br />\nUniversity of Rochester, much of the<br />\nresearch being conducted today is<br />\nuseless, simply because the researchers,<br />\nand the public are so highly opinionated<br />\non the subject of marijuana.<br />\n\"What I see happening today,\"<br />\nshe said, \"is a lot of research being<br />\nconducted with an eye toward proving<br />\nthat marijuana is harmful or trying to<br />\nprove that it is harmless.\" In either case,<br />\nshe stated, the bias of the researcher,<br />\nthe fact that he is trying to justify one<br />\nor the other opinion about the drug,<br />\ninvalidates most of the research effort.<br />\nWhat is needed, she continued, is<br />\nresearch conducted merely to find out<br />\nmore than we already know. There is<br />\nvery little of this significant research<br />\nbeing conducted today,she said.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Nowlis believes that Cannabis<br />\n(the generic name for marijuana), like<br />\nmost drugs, may be harmful for some<br />\npeople, in certain dosages, and under<br />\ncertain circumstances. In her book,<br />\nDrugs on the College Campus, however,<br />\nshe states that \"When cannabis is<br />\ncompared with alcohol, amphetamines,<br />\nbarbiturates, nicotine, opiates and many<br />\nother drugs, its potential for risk and for<br />\nabuse appears to be relatively low.\"<br />\nSome of the most frightening<br />\nresearch results which have been<br />\nrevealed recently have come from the<br />\nUniversity of Georgia in Augusta. There,<br />\nDr. William F. Geber, Associate<br />\nProfessor of Pharmacology, in the<br />\nmedical school at Augusta, has<br />\nproduced dead or malformed fetuses in<br />\nhamster and rabbit litters, by injecting<br />\nthe mother with large quantities of resin<br />\ndrawn from the marijuana plant.<br />\nDr. Geber said that the extent of<br />\nmalformation or death varied almost<br />\ndirectly with the dosage levels<br />\nadministered. In addition, there was a<br />\ndifference when the injection was drawn<br />\nfrom plants grown in New Jersey, or<br />\nfrom marijuana grown in Mexico (which<br />\nis generally more potent).<br />\nDr. Geber was careful to include,<br />\nhowever, that at low dosages (still<br />\nconsiderably higher than the<br />\nconcentration obtainable in a human<br />\nbeing), there was no malformation of<br />\nfetuses. He added that the research in<br />\nwhich he was presently engaged<br />\nprovided little solid knowledge on the<br />\neffects of marijuana in the human.<br />\nResearch more directly applicable<br />\nto human consumption is being<br />\nconducted at the New York Medical<br />\nCollege, where a team of scientists are,<br />\nfeeding electro-encephalogram graphs<br />\n<br />\ninto a computer.

If the<br />\nstudents wish the University to leave them alone and allow them to persue<br />\ntheir own course with regard to moral and social matters, it is inconsistent<br />\nto believe that the University should reassume its position in loco parentis<br />\nwhen its students get in trouble.<br />\nDr. Gordon made it abundantly clear that the University could offer<br />\nno protection once it had abandoned its role as the keeper of morality and<br />\nlegality on the campus. The logic of this position is inarguable and we<br />\nonly regret that the students in the dormitories were not made completely<br />\naware of this at the beginning of the year.<br />\nHowever, to contend that the University has no responsibility in a<br />\n-case such as the current police action is an oversimplification. The<br />\nUniversity compels all freshman to live in the dormitories on campus.<br />\nThough it has completely divested itself of responsibility for what<br />\nstudents do, it remains in firm control of where they do it.<br />\nWhen one acciimulates five-hundred people between the ages of 17<br />\nand 22 in two buildings, there is going to be a significant percentage of<br />\nresidents who smoke marijuana. The students know this, the police know<br />\nit, and the University should know it. A dormitory full of grass is more<br />\nthan fair game for a bust. Paid student informers and other undercover<br />\ninformation sources are common in such a situation.<br />\nWhat the University has done, then, is to give the students full<br />\nresponsibility for their actions. But it has also made the students(who are<br />\nsupposed to \"take their own chances\") sitting ducks for informers and<br />\npolice action of this kind.<br />\nWhat is also disturbing in a larger sense is that our administrators<br />\nwere so completely stunned by last week's bust. It is comforting to know<br />\nthat the University had no part in the action. However, the failure to<br />\nprepare, even in the most basic manner, for such an eventuality, reflects a<br />\nfailure either in reasoning or in communication.<br />\nIf the administration was aware of the amount of marijuana in the<br />\ndormitories, it must also have been aware of the possibility of a bust. If<br />\nthe officials knew of smoking in the dorms, why was the University<br />\nreaction to a raid not considered? On the other hand, Dr. Gordon and<br />\nothers have implied that most administrators underestimated drug activity<br />\non campus. If this is the case, there is a surprising ignorance on the part of<br />\nadministrators regarding conditions in the dormitories. The drug activity<br />\nin the dormitories has been only too evident since September. If the<br />\n<br />\nt(K<br />\n<br />\nIn Support of the Teach-In<br />\nIt has become increasingly clear in the last three years that the goal<br />\nof the American military establishment are not consistent with the spirit or<br />\npurpose of a free academic community. The activities of the military as a<br />\nforce for suppression both in this country and abroad make it imperative<br />\nthat Hopkins divest itself of any association with the armed forces.<br />\nThe fact that ROTC students no longer receive academic credits for<br />\ntheir activities does not alter the University's tacit complicity in the<br />\nefforts and program of the military. The presence of the armed forces or<br />\ntheir training wings on campus can do nothing but compromise the<br />\nprinciple of free inquiry and thought on which the University must stand.<br />\nFor these reasons, we support SDS and the NUC in their teach-in this<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nHowever, there lingers the question of how much good removing<br />\nROTC from the campus will do. According to military experts, SDS is<br />\nwrong in its contention that the elimination of ROTC from the campuses<br />\nwill appreciably hurt the armed forces of the U.S. There are many ways<br />\nby which the Army could insure a continuing flow of officers into the<br />\nservice. The eradication of ROTC will not hurt the military or even alter<br />\nits role in the society significantly.<br />\nIf SDS is sincere in its attempt to combat militarism in this country,<br />\nits attack on ROTC is ill-targeted. A much greater effect on the power and<br />\ninfluence of the army in America could be achieved by concentration on<br />\ndraft resistance. Whereas the Army does not need ROTC to train officers,<br />\nit does need the draft to supply manpower.<br />\nWe support the teach-in today, therefore, in that we agree with the<br />\nanalysis of the goals of the University which is propounded by the NUC<br />\nand SDS.<br />\nROTC is philosophically and idealogically an anomaly at Hopkins. It<br />\nmust be stated,.however, that in terms of pratical effect on the military in<br />\nAmerica, the current offensive is futile.<br />\n<br />\nA Sporting Chance<br />\nThe recent decision to eliminate five sports from intercollegiate<br />\ncompetition is reprehensible on two counts. First, there is the obvious fact<br />\nthat by cutting these five sports, in which over one-fourth of the<br />\nUniversity's intercollegiate athletes are involved, the administration has<br />\nsaved only $14,240. The total athletic budget, some $245,000, has not<br />\nbeen significantly decreased by the elimination of these sports. Moreover,<br />\nno public attempt was made by the University to secure sufficient funds<br />\nto continue the sports. Chances are, if a public appeal were made,<br />\ncontributions from alumni would more than supply the teams.<br />\nSecond and even more disturbing is the way in which the. University<br />\nmade and announced this decision. Not only was there no public appeal,<br />\nbut people intimately connected with the athletic department as well as<br />\nconcerned students were taken by surprise by the move. We hope that<br />\nevery effort will be made to rescue these intercollegiate sports from<br />\noblivion. Moreover, we hope that in the future, the administration will see<br />\nfit to consult those affected by their decisions before those decisions are<br />\nmade.<br />\n<br />\nAMP IU RAVE PANS<br />\nIN MY BACK AtJp<br />\nGlioRTmEss OF<br />\n<br />\nAMP RI_ 9-10KE Too<br />\nMxH AND HAVE A<br />\n2RIK)1036 PROBLEM.<br />\n<br />\nAMP<br />\n<br />\nHAVE A 500-<br />\n<br />\nDon l'ilbli.hery Hall syndicate 194,1<br />\n<br />\nni_<br />\nTRIG.<br />\n<br />\nI <<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\nUniversity officials had not noticed it by April, we can only conclude that<br />\nthey lacked the concern to look.<br />\nThis lack of concern is not startling.

If this requirement is maintained, the<br />\nadministration will have to acknowledge that it retains a measure of its<br />\nresponsibility toward the students. If students must live on campus, the<br />\nUniversity must do everything it can to keep police off. If the University<br />\nis loathe to reassume responsibility for its students, on the other hafid, it<br />\ncannot in good conscience require that the students live in a building<br />\nwhere they are completely at the mercy of their environment.<br />\n<br />\nJOHN HOLLIS, Features Editor<br />\nPHIL HEAGNF,Y, Research Editor<br />\n<br />\nKikrw EMMY wHAT<br />\nILL t_o0i( oKE FORTY<br />\nVEARs FRoH NOw<br />\n<br />\nPAL -I.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nWH011.1, GROW<br />\nOP To 1.00K<br />\nJUST<br />\n<br />\n010 I Warr<br />\nSE A6LE To<br />\nGET TIROUGH<br />\n-10 -<br />\n<br />\nAI\"JPWHO'1,/,AWAYS<br />\nSIP MTH HIS<br />\nMan-IER AGAIPST<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nNSILLSEcRET<br />\ntoSH HEV<br />\nKJEVER FE-60<br />\nFai2k).<br />\n<br />\ncci-A-rs<br />\n15<br />\ni\u2018 MA50<br />\n<br />\nWAS gAyIK6<br />\nANP scAPED<br />\nHysCLF,<br />\n<br />\nCV,j L.!<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 2, 1969<br />\n<br />\nAbandon Ye the Creeping Meatball<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nI had heard that a bust was coming but I didn't<br />\ntake the rumors seriously. So, when the bust actually did<br />\ncome, last Thursday night, I was surprised.<br />\nI was sitting in a friend's room reading, of all<br />\nthings, a Jerry Rubin manifesto in Evergreen.

But after reading the Rubin manifesto, to do<br />\nanything but run outside and join the crowd would have<br />\nbeen selling out.<br />\nI ran over to Royce and Sylvester, and I was happy<br />\nto see an angry crowd milling about. Then I realized- A<br />\nBUST! The rumors were true. All the paranoia, all the<br />\nfears, all those kids flushing pipes down the toilet were<br />\nright.<br />\nI was hoping that maybe,just maybe, this crowd<br />\nwould explode.

When two students were led,<br />\nhandcuffed, to the police, the crowd trailed behind<br />\nthem, hooting and jeering deliriously. The hoarse, angry,<br />\ncathartic cheers swept the crow& like a mania. PIGS!<br />\nPIGS! PIGS! Here, on the placid Hopkins campus, kids<br />\nwere shouting like Yippics in Chicago.<br />\nThe police car in the road was quickly surrounded<br />\nby chanting kids. Some students then demonstrated the<br />\nusual Hopkins lack of imagination by sitting in the road<br />\nefore the<br />\nand chanting \"The whole world is watching\"-b rather<br />\nwere<br />\nthey<br />\nrmore,<br />\nFurthe<br />\ng.<br />\nanythin<br />\ndid<br />\ncops even<br />\nblock<br />\nstupidly situated at the side of the car, unable to<br />\n<br />\nanything. Nevertheless, aware that basically it was a<br />\nmeaningless act, I joined the kids sitting down.

Clark is commonly portrayed as<br />\na provincial of such small intellectual<br />\ngifts that we were fortunate to escape<br />\nhis being President. For instance, Elmer<br />\nDavis wrote in 1924 that Clark was the<br />\nPresident we deserved in 1912, and that<br />\nwe were fortunate to have Clark<br />\ndefeated for the Presidential nomination<br />\nby Woodrow Wilson.<br />\nUnfortunately, much of Clark's<br />\nown discourse tends to fortify the<br />\nproposition that he was a provincial. He<br />\nonce made a blazing speech indicating<br />\nthat the South was being ignored in<br />\nAmerican history for the benefit of New<br />\nEngland; that the South was a land of<br />\ndoers, but that New England was a land<br />\nof writers.<br />\nThus, he said, the little love affairs<br />\nof New England had been portrayed as<br />\nepic romances; the skirmishes on New<br />\nEngland soil had been glorified and<br />\ncredited, in one case, with the \"shot<br />\nheard round the world.\"<br />\nThis speech was criticized as<br />\nignorant. In fact there is no doubt that<br />\nfor protracted periods American literary<br />\nand historical writing has been<br />\ndominated by New Englanders. Thomas<br />\nWentworth Higginson wrote in 1862<br />\nthat \"the organizing New England<br />\n<br />\nmind\" was required to produce<br />\nAmerican literature. Historical literature<br />\nwas emanating from the same place, in<br />\nsuch persons as Parkman, Prescott,<br />\nBancroft and Fiske. This face was noted<br />\nby Frederick Jackson Turner and,<br />\nwhatever his other faults, Turner did<br />\ninspire some serious study of Western<br />\nregions.<br />\nJefferson Wrote Better<br />\nClark's enthusiasm definitely led<br />\nhim to excesses. For instance, he said<br />\nthat John Adams was held in higher<br />\nregard than Jefferson, although<br />\nJefferson was much more intelligent,<br />\nbecause Adams was a better writer. It is<br />\nhard to believe that a conspicuous<br />\ndelegate to the turn-of-the-century<br />\nDemocratic National Conventions<br />\nwould consider Adams to be held in<br />\nhigher regard than Jefferson. Adams, by<br />\nhis own testimony, knew that Jefferson<br />\nwrote better than he did.<br />\nNevertheless, Clark's<br />\nmiscellaneous writings show a good<br />\ngrasp of history. He wrote no large-scale<br />\nhistorical work, save his own memoirs.<br />\nHe did write a scattered series of<br />\nsketches and essays which compare<br />\nfavorably with the historical work of<br />\nWilson. Wilson's writing style was often<br />\neloquent, but at times affected.<br />\nWilson also has a distressing<br />\n<br />\ntendency to give insufficient support to<br />\nhis generalizations. Clark wrote lucidly,<br />\nemphasizing facts and making<br />\ninterpretations that followed his facts<br />\nrather closely. For instance, he gave a<br />\ngood characterization of John Randolph<br />\nof Roanoke, that Randolph seemed to<br />\nhave read everything and forgoten<br />\nalmost nothing.<br />\nHesitant Voter<br />\nClark also expressed his pride that<br />\nit was a Missouri Senator, Republican<br />\n\u2022Senator Henderson, who cast the<br />\ndecisive vote against the attempt to<br />\nremove President Johnson from office.<br />\nThis is of interest, since the writings of<br />\nD.W. Brogan and John F. Kennedy have<br />\nemphasized the role of the hesitant<br />\nSenator Edmund G. Ross.<br />\nObviously, since the impeachment<br />\nfailed by one vote, any one of nineteen<br />\nvotes (even those of the Democrats)<br />\nmay be claimed as the decisive one. But<br />\nit may be suggested that the Senator<br />\nwho hesitated longest in deciding how<br />\nto vote was not the most courageous.<br />\nClark's general political position<br />\nwas progressive. He supported the secret<br />\nballot, the initiative and referendum,<br />\nand reductions in tarriff rates. He was<br />\nnot explicit on all issues, but it would<br />\nbe foolhardy to portray him as a<br />\nreactionary in conflict with the<br />\nprogressive Wilson.<br />\n<br />\nClark and Wilson did have one<br />\ngreat conflict. In 1917 Clark was<br />\nSpeaker of the House, a position whose<br />\nauthority he had helped to undercut in<br />\nthe \"Revolution of 1910\" against<br />\n\"Czar\" Joseph Cannon. Clark could<br />\nhave used more authority in 1917, when<br />\nhe fought vainly against Wilson's request<br />\nfor conscription. Carlk said, \"There is<br />\nprecious little difference between<br />\n'conscript' and 'convict.\" Surely Clark<br />\ndeserves a place among the pantheon of<br />\nheroes of the S.D.S.<br />\nBut Clark's managers did not give<br />\nside<br />\nsufficient stress to the intellectual<br />\ni<br />\nMissour<br />\nof his nature. In 1912, the<br />\nfor,<br />\nhim<br />\ned<br />\nsuggest<br />\nhad<br />\ntion<br />\nState Conven<br />\nPresident to the insinuating strains 01<br />\nthe Houn'.

What appalls me is that the writer seems to<br />\nadvocate the university's becoming involved in some way<br />\nWith \"...the study of art in a creative...context.\"<br />\nI am by now convinced that the only thing that<br />\nnu-going, creative art, in any medium, needs for its<br />\ncun.tinual replenishing and revivifying are human powers,<br />\nwhich must be left as unencumbered as possible by any<br />\ngrouP, organization, social structuring or curriculum. An<br />\norepanized, socially constructed context, such as a<br />\nUniversity affords, inevitably has the same effect on the<br />\nProcesses of artistic creation as anti-matter has on<br />\ntatter: the two are annihilated upon collision.<br />\n, It is not surprising that no great creative artist has<br />\n'Peen found to be sustained and nurtured by any<br />\n!eademy, college, or other intellectual in-gathering.<br />\n.1kdeed, quartets-, writers-, and artists-in-residence at<br />\nvarious campuses are regarded as something of<br />\nari<br />\na omalies and appear to be almost supinely captive<br />\nLnete.<br />\nGross Incompatability<br />\nTo my way of thinking there are four essential<br />\n?sons for this gross incompatibility of artist and a<br />\nuniversity milieu. The first is that all great creative art<br />\nrPrings from intrinsic pressures, from forces internally<br />\n!tierated by the artist, e.g. Schubert wrote because he<br />\nnad to, he couldn't help it. Universities, contrarily,<br />\n\u00b0Perate on the basis of extrinsic, outwardly imposed<br />\nrequirements and pressures: schedules, lectures, credits,<br />\nreados, assignments. There is absolutely no compatibility<br />\ntween the two methods of structuring behavior.<br />\nft The second reason is that any artist is by nature a<br />\n.e\u00b0 agent, following no rules except those necessary to<br />\n!sure his minimal existence in a hostile society, and<br />\n1\u00b0se of his art. Being an artist\u2014in direct contrast to<br />\nZYing the chattering aesthete\u2014entails a miserable life of<br />\n'eat<br />\nre<br />\nand sacrifice. I wonder how many people here<br />\ntoailize<br />\nl that fact in their bones, or have any idea of the<br />\n,the frustration, the bitterness, and the tenacity that<br />\ne both required and engendered by such genuine,<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nascetic grappling. Being a member of a university<br />\ncommunity, whether student, professor. researcher, or<br />\nbattener on others, has but little to do with<br />\nself-abnegation and especially with working in a clearly<br />\ndefined medium. The two ways of living, as well as their<br />\nproducts, simply don't intersect.<br />\nNo Rational Sense<br />\nThirdly, the essential functions of a student in a<br />\nuniversity and that of an artist are totally at varience. A<br />\nuniversity exists to discover and perhaps to disseminate<br />\ntruth. The function of an artist is. bluntly, to make a lie,<br />\nto fib, to confabulate, to put in place what didn't exist<br />\nbefore, to collate and arrange the abstract materials he<br />\nuses into meaningful and persuasive patterns. Sonority<br />\nwithout rational sense, for instance, is anathema to<br />\nacademically impacted persons, but Mallarme and<br />\nSwinburne did all right by its dictates.<br />\nFinally, just look at the difference in life-styles<br />\nbetween the typical (but not, fortunately, universally<br />\ntypical) \"successful\" student and an artist. Those who<br />\nhave succumbed to school's extrinsic pressures have had<br />\ntheir spirits burned away, they have lost all their wits<br />\nand are robots. And the adults have become puerile and<br />\nstand for nothing in particular. Artists have got to keep<br />\ntheir wits about them, have got to keep open the lines of<br />\npermutation and possibility, to conserve and nurture a<br />\nmeasure of eclat and elan, which are in any case but the<br />\nnatural, functional psycho-motoric correllaries of flair<br />\nand talent rigorously pursued.<br />\nWhat we presently have at universities that purport<br />\nto foster the creative arts, and what is the best we can<br />\nhope to have, even at meccas like Harvard or Berkeley<br />\n(\"which have EVERYTHING\"), is one of two things:<br />\neither the dry husks and shells of the past centuries' art<br />\nand culture, carefully fondled and swaddled by<br />\nself-appointed curators(as if art had to be mummified to<br />\nsurvive!), or an anarchic pastiche of slabs and dabs at<br />\ntechniques, lacquered over with jejune enthusiasm and a<br />\ndeep contempt for tradition. The rare dissenter, like<br />\nBrustein at Yale, who thinks too much freedom<br />\ncollapses itself, is swamped.<br />\nImmense amounts of money are lavished on<br />\nrecords, concerts, galleries, studios, and ateliers. But<br />\nsomehow, terribly, most of the effort seems to come<br />\n<br />\ndown to mere self-indulgence, as in finger-painting, while<br />\nactivists, naturally, think all art is cant.<br />\nArtistic creation, whose beginnings were detected<br />\nby Freud in the infant's pride over his bowel<br />\nmovements, now has\u2014especially at university<br />\nconservatories and their attendant culture warehouses<br />\nand merchandise barns, in paintings, sculpture, and '<br />\naleatory noise\u2014its ultimate manifestation in creations<br />\nwhose contents betray a similar pride and a similar<br />\ndegree of autonomy\u2014and a similar product.<br />\nBuy A Bordello<br />\nI would beg Johns I lopkins to leave Culture with a<br />\ncapital C, meaning the greatness of Mankind, alone.<br />\nUniversity funds might better be spent on a hundred<br />\nthings: a bordello for interested students and faculty, a<br />\nhigh-rise parking garage. buying off the roving gangs of<br />\npetty thugs who destroy so much campus flora and<br />\nproperty, etc. The basic truth is that one cannot teach<br />\nVirgil, Dante. Newton, Mozart, and Rembrandt without<br />\nkilling them. Anyone who cares about these or related<br />\naspects of the human condition and finds them<br />\n\"relevant\" will, by the time he gets to a university, have<br />\nbeen actively exploring them, by himself, for years on<br />\nend. If he wants technical training, he'll go to a master<br />\nor expert\u2014you don't cage the maestro for the convenient<br />\naccess of tyros and callow collegians. If he needs the<br />\ncompany of others similarly engaged, he'll find it by<br />\nfollowing his nose.<br />\nAs for those considerably rarer birds, the true<br />\nartists, why, they need in fact not much more than air,<br />\nsilence, their artistic materials and the generosity of a<br />\nfew friends, to stay alive and do what they have to.(But,<br />\nsad thought, there is nowhere accessible they can find<br />\nthe first two, the cash nexus and inflation increasingly<br />\ncrimp the third, and who today is capable of such<br />\nfriendship?) Art is, happily, far too difficult and arcane a<br />\nhuman pursuit ever to be amenable to the machinations<br />\nof the school monks: let us hope that it is also far too<br />\nresiliant, and its apprentices too obdurately pugnacious<br />\nand hughty-deluded, ever to be led down the garden<br />\npath by a university's well-meaning but disastrous<br />\naffections.<br />\n<br />\nGood Massa, Bad Massa, Bad Acting, Bad Movie<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nSoon Baltimore will see its second motion picture<br />\nPremier of the year, the first being Andy Warhol's<br />\nlirnitation of Christ.

The cops did it for me. I saw this cop<br />\nZiPping out a aerosol can, and my mind flashed<br />\nZtantly- MACE! But instead of running away<br />\nounediately like any normal person, I paused a fraction<br />\na second to see what it looked like. Then I ran away<br />\nbugrriedly, my hands covering my head. The stinging and<br />\nse Nog suddenly hit my eyes and I found myself<br />\noirLeaming like a madman. But inwardly, and I'm sure<br />\nth\"'ers felt this way, too, I was glad. I was baptized into<br />\n;tee revolution. I had been.... brutalized. At last, after<br />\nnears of yearning for a confrontation, only a viewer,<br />\ner a participant, I had, at last, been attacked. I had<br />\n;<br />\nc4tched the convention brutalities on T.V. and<br />\nkr!anied in horror when the cops beat up those kids. I<br />\n\u2022 read the articles on the Columbia police riot with<br />\nIrtnated horror, relishing each tidbit of police violence.<br />\n\u00b0W, I toa had been attacked.<br />\nih With a crazy mixture of pain and .ecstasy I ran to<br />\nrpY dorm to wash my eyes out. It really hurt, and I was<br />\n\"Rddened with the burning of my eyes. I was secretly<br />\nh.ad that there were some kids in the dorm near the<br />\nwaterfountain to watch me suffer. They gave me advice<br />\nl screamed in hoarse confusion. Yet, even with all this<br />\nf,ain, I was inwardly pleased at the expressions on their<br />\ntKe..es. They had the same shocked look on their faces<br />\n\"t I had when I saw others being beaten on T.V. I was<br />\n<br />\ntheir Chicago.<br />\nUpstairs, my joy at being maced became rather less<br />\nsecret. As I stood over the sink dunking my head in the<br />\nwater, I turned to the kid next to me and said, \"Well, at<br />\nleast you've been radicalized.\" In a rather startling<br />\nincident, I heard kids screaming about tear gas, and<br />\nwhen I picked up my head, I saw white smoke coming<br />\nthrough the bathroom windows. I almost collapsed from<br />\nfright until I realized that it was steam from the showers.<br />\nAfter dunking my head a few more times, I rushed to<br />\nmy room grabbed my army jacket (A Must for Campus<br />\nRebels!) and ran out to sec the riot I hoped would be<br />\nforthcoming.<br />\nI ran out proudly, my disheveled, sopping wet<br />\nappearance proof of my Battle with the Pigs. My eyes<br />\nstill stung to remind me of it. What greeted me,<br />\nhowever, was not an angry mob, but surprisingly listless<br />\nstudents milling about. I ranted at the crowd angrily for<br />\ntheir placidness in the face of this shocking assault. In a<br />\nhoarse voice, I hollered,\"What do they have to do, man?<br />\nKill us or something? On to Gordon's!\" Unfortunately,<br />\nthe crowd was not instantly mesmerized by this<br />\nfascinating display of eloquence, and I had to wait<br />\naround a few minutes until I could find some friends<br />\nwho were willing to walk over to Gordon's house with<br />\nme.<br />\nSuch is the lot of a revolutionary.<br />\n<br />\nDilsey-like life attitudes. There is the patient<br />\never-suffering Bible quoting black Baptist, but mercifully<br />\nno banjo-strumming Bojangles or tap dancing. For<br />\nscenery we have the Big White llouse On The Hill, and<br />\nof course, The Swamp.<br />\nThe character played by Stephen Boyd combines<br />\n\u2022<br />\ntwo other well-known Southern stock figures, the<br />\nvicious heartless Bad Massa and the empty Alcoholic.<br />\nHowever, Mr. Boyd's acting abilities are highly<br />\ndebatable, and he has great difficulty convincing his<br />\naudience that he is that evil. No one despises the<br />\nPhantom of the Opera any more; we laugh at his<br />\nexaggerated melodrama.<br />\nDionne Warwick, wearing the latest 1969 Afro<br />\nfashions (this is 1850, remember), makes her screen<br />\ndebut as the alcoholic mistress of the Bad Massa, a role<br />\nwith probably very little historical precendent. Her<br />\namateurish performance is even more lifeless and<br />\nunconvincing than Mr. Boyd's. Ossic Davis, as the black<br />\nwho sees the light and decides to \"haul ass for freedom\",<br />\nis the only realistic actor in a forest of wooden statues.<br />\nHe is murdered at the end, undoubtedly for being the<br />\nonly talented one in the whole movie. Davis is the only<br />\nactor who tries to expand upon and develop his stock<br />\nrole.<br />\nSlaves has a definite message, and perhaps for that<br />\nreason we can overlook the stereotyped characters and<br />\nsetting. Those things did exist, they were common;<br />\notherwise, they would not have become stereotypes.<br />\nHopefully, a film based on common scenes and<br />\nwell-known character types will try to find new meaning<br />\nin those archetypes, or at least broaden one's viewpoint<br />\non related issues. Biberman fails to do that in Slaves.<br />\nSlavery Is Bad<br />\nThe moral of the film: slavery is bad, human<br />\nbeings shouldn't own other human beings. Great for<br />\n1850. But not 1969. The film, according to Biberman, is<br />\ntrying to \"tell it like it was,\" with the intention of also<br />\nbeing relevant to contemporary race problems. Not too<br />\nmany people are going to dispute that slavery is bad and<br />\nfreedom is good. But there does seem to be some<br />\ndisagreement, among people of all races, about present<br />\nracial conflicts. Slaves, despite its claims, is in no way<br />\nrelevant to that.

Next week:<br />\nThe Community Action Agency.<br />\nBy HEY WOOD SANDERS<br />\nSpecial to the News-Letter<br />\nThe national Model Cities program was<br />\npresented to the Congress in 1966 with much.<br />\nfanfare, and with many high expectations. Now,<br />\nin 1969, it looks as if many of the expectations<br />\nwill remain unfulfilled, and that the programs.<br />\nwill bring nothing to the over-policed and<br />\nunder-developed Inner City of Baltimore.<br />\nIn introducing the program, former President<br />\nJohnson said that it was \"To build not just housing units<br />\nbut neighborhoods; not just to construct schools, but to<br />\neducate children; not just to raise income, but to create<br />\nbeauty and end the poisoning of our environment.\"<br />\nWith these goals, Model Cities were developed to<br />\nprovide funds for new and innovative projects and<br />\ncomprehensive planning. These projects were to be<br />\nFunded with special Federal grants of up to 80 percent<br />\nof the cost. All programs were required to be<br />\ncomprehensive, concentrated, and to have substantial<br />\nimpact on the Model neighborhoods.<br />\nMaximum Impact<br />\nUnfortunately, the program is only to last five<br />\nyears, and projects which are self- sustaining at the end<br />\nof that period will be out of both money and support.<br />\nAs a result, the Model Cities program must be developed<br />\nwith an eye to gaining the maximum impact and benefit<br />\nas soon as possible. Needed citizen backing will only<br />\ncome after the relevance and the meaning of the<br />\nprogram is demonstrated, and unless services are<br />\ndelivered rapidly, this program will go the way of many<br />\nPrevious ones.<br />\nBaltimore's program was developed with nine<br />\nspecific goals in mind: adequate income, a decent<br />\nstandard of health, a decent home in a suitable<br />\nenvironment, a quality education, stability of family,<br />\nopportunities for use of leisure time, a more highly<br />\ndeveloped internal economy, and individual and<br />\n<br />\ncommunity self-sufficiency.<br />\nThe actual achievement of these goals will depend<br />\non the success of the 36 proposed programs submitted<br />\nto the national Department of Housing and Urban<br />\nDevelopment, and the Baltimore City Council. The<br />\nprogram will cost between $10 and 12 million in Model<br />\nCities funds alone in the first year. The largest part of<br />\n/<br />\n2 million, will be for<br />\nthe expenditure, close to $31<br />\nhousing programs.<br />\nThe proposed distribution of funds represents one<br />\nof the major initial failings of the program. More money<br />\nis being poured into housing programs which can create<br />\npleasant looking neighborhoods, but which fail to do<br />\nanything to end poverty and the cycle of failure in<br />\nAmerican ghettoes.<br />\nSince the Housing Act of 1949, which began the<br />\nNational Program of Public Housing, far too much of<br />\nlimited resources have been earmarked to build buildings<br />\nrather than people.<br />\nThis expenditure for housing will be reflected in<br />\nthe priority given projects in the first year, and could<br />\nlead to an even greater emphasis on the environmental<br />\ngoal than the amount indicates.<br />\nMoney to Professionals<br />\nIn spite of the large degree of neighborhood<br />\ninvolvement and control in the project, much of the<br />\npersonnel money will be going to professionals. The<br />\nModel Cities program will employ 316 professionals, 67<br />\nclerical workers, and 340 neighborhood people. Thus,<br />\nmuch of the first year funds will be going to well paid<br />\npeople who have often worked previously for city<br />\nagencies.<br />\nThe large number of professional positions is<br />\nreflected in the unfortunate top-heaviness in the total<br />\norganization. In addition, each of the individual.<br />\nprograms will require a separate staff and director,<br />\nincreasing the number of chiefs in the Agency.<br />\nAlthough the programs generally represent an<br />\nimaginative and innovative approach, their number,<br />\ndispersion, and limited coverage guarantee limited<br />\nsuccess at best.<br />\nIn the field of Manpower, the Agency has<br />\nproposed four programs. The first of these is a program<br />\nto train under-employed young people, with 300<br />\n<br />\ntrainees in the first year. Two other programs will settIP<br />\ncorporations, one for custodial maintenance and anot116<br />\nfor homemakers, to be owned and operated by ti\",<br />\nneighborhood. These programs will employ a total 01<br />\neighty individuals. While they represent interesting i&Js<br />\nthey will make scant impact on an area with over 5,v<br />\nunemployed workers.<br />\nIn addition, the Manpower proposal calls for l,,%1<br />\nexperimental income supplement plan, providing a<br />\nmoney and services to two groups of 150 fa milies<br />\n!<br />\nThis represents about one percent of the Well<br />\npopulation of the Model neighborhood. Thus, it isi.;<br />\nexperiment in social welfare that can only prove vi',.<br />\nwe already know\u2014that welfare payments are inadalt12:\u201e<br />\nThe Manpower program will do very little to\",<br />\nthe problems of inner-city poverty. Without pro\"<br />\nnew jobs with meaningful chances for advancemellt,1<br />\nproblem will continue to grow, as industries and J\u00b0<br />\nmove out to the suburbs.<br />\nThese jobs could be provided in the governinl<br />\nsector, particularly if the funds being spent by<br />\nCities were spent in one place, or in one direction.,';<br />\ncity administration seems unwilling to make that kin'<br />\ncommitment today.<br />\nr.<br />\nInnovative Baltimore<br />\nDespite its failure to benefit more i11ner4io\u00b0f<br />\n\"i<br />\nresidents, the Baltimore Model Cities program is ofie.,;i Pr,<br />\nproblenl<br />\ni<br />\nthe more innovative in the nation.

Harvard's<br />\nproffered degree in Black Studies<br />\nis probably the most advanced<br />\naction taken to date, but a<br />\nnumber of other schools including<br />\nYale, Stanford, NYU, Berkley,<br />\nand Brown teach courses in the<br />\nBlack Studies area.<br />\n<br />\nThese are some of the<br />\nprograms now in effect:<br />\nBROWN\u2014An undergraduate<br />\nseminar in \"Black Assertation\" is<br />\nbeing given this semester with<br />\nplans to include it in a definite<br />\ninterdepartmental concentration<br />\nin Black Studies by next fall.

Little change<br />\nCould be foreseen by Clements, either in<br />\nAmerica or in the Church.<br />\n\"The Roman Catholic Church is<br />\nno different than any other white<br />\norganization; it always has been and<br />\ngives every indication that it will<br />\nContinue to be,\" the Catholic Priest<br />\nClaimed. Further, the Catholic Church<br />\nhas continually addressed itself to White<br />\n<br />\nSociety, and is a definite part of that<br />\nsociety, he claimed.<br />\nIll Prepared<br />\nFather Clements felt that<br />\nCatholicism is \"ill-prepared\" to fulfill<br />\nits role in the Black Community. It is<br />\nnot cognizant of the changing needs in<br />\nthe Negro community.<br />\nSpeaking of the problems of<br />\nNegro Priests in general, Father<br />\nClements pointed out \"We are Black<br />\nfirst, we are born Black, and it is only<br />\nlater, after a period of time, that we<br />\nbecome Catholic priests.\" He suggested<br />\nthat Black priests may.eventually utilize<br />\nseparation as a technique to achieve<br />\nsome relevance \"to their Church and<br />\ntheir People.\"<br />\nHe deplored the lack of Black<br />\npriests in any decison-making position<br />\nin the entire U0ed States. Citing the<br />\nrecent Black Caucus, Clements pointed<br />\n<br />\nout that not one priest there could ever<br />\nremember being called in for<br />\nconsultation by their bishop. He could<br />\nnot conceive of a problem in a Polish or<br />\nGerman coininfinity being set tied<br />\nwithout consultation with the<br />\nappropriate Polish or German priests.<br />\nBlack Pressure<br />\nA further case in 'point was the<br />\nproblem in Clements' own parish in<br />\nChicago, which until recently was<br />\nheaded by a white pastor. Upon his<br />\nretirement, original plans called for the<br />\nappointment of another white priest to<br />\nsucceed him as pastor. Only pressure<br />\nfrom the Black community prevented<br />\nthis appointment, and forced the bishop<br />\nto appoint a Black pastor. Clements<br />\nhimself was transferred from the parish,<br />\nand has been promised a pastorship in<br />\nsome Black community in the near<br />\nfuture.<br />\nFather Clements had certain<br />\nconcrete suggestions for the<br />\n<br />\nimprovement of the church. Lie was not<br />\noptimistic over the fate of his<br />\nsuggestions, however, explaining that<br />\nthey will be implemented, \"Only if the<br />\nwhite man wants them.\"<br />\nHe suggested a general<br />\nre-evaluation of attitudes toward Black<br />\nmilitants, both within and outside the'<br />\nchurch. He further urged more effective<br />\nutilization of Black priests, especially in<br />\ndecision-making positions. Other<br />\nsuggestions were directed to getting<br />\nBlack priests into dioceses in which<br />\nthere are no Black priests, or if this<br />\nwere not possible, a screening of white<br />\nPriests by the Black community in<br />\nwhich they are to be placed.<br />\nA final suggestion was that each<br />\ndiocese allocate funds on a permanent<br />\nbasis for \"Black Leadership Training\"<br />\nand after allocation of the funds, the<br />\nWhite Community must, in the words of<br />\nFr.

The<br />\ndecision was formally announced<br />\nMonday.<br />\nOn a broad level, this decision has<br />\nseveral effects which are damaging to<br />\nstudents in general. It removes 90% of<br />\nopportunity for those interested in<br />\nindividual sports. It removes all<br />\nopportunity for those who are not<br />\ninterested in the so-called \"major\"<br />\nsports (i.e., Lacrosse, Football,<br />\nBasketball, Soccer, Swimming,<br />\nWrestling, and Baseball). It removes all<br />\nopportunity for those who are not good<br />\nenough in \"major- sports to earn a<br />\nVarsity Letter. And it removes all<br />\nopportunity for those interested in<br />\nlearning a new sport in college. It is,<br />\n<br />\ntherefore, a decision which is unfair to<br />\nthe majority of undergraduates.<br />\nWith regard to fencing alone, this<br />\ndecision is nothing short of tragic. It<br />\nmakes absolutely meaningless the aches,<br />\npains, sweat, and hard work which all of<br />\nus have put in, especially for freshmen,<br />\nsophmores and juniors. It invalidates the<br />\nmany sacrifices - over and above the call<br />\nof studies which all of us have made. It<br />\ndestroys the twenty year tradition of<br />\nexcellence which has made fencing one<br />\nof the (only) two consistently winning<br />\nteams at Hopkins. It completely wipes<br />\naway the intense pride which has been<br />\nfor the past twelve years. Worst of all, it<br />\nleaves the University without fencing which is a tragedy.<br />\nSo we have never placed lower<br />\nthan third in an 8-team conference? So<br />\nwe had the only men ever to win a<br />\ncon ference championship in two<br />\nweapons (Tom Ahern, MAC,<br />\nEpee-1962, Foil-1963), .and to win a<br />\n<br />\nchampionship in two conferences (Jerry<br />\nLam, MAC and NAC, 1966)? So we had<br />\nmore guys on our varsity and freshman<br />\ncombined roster (average 35)each year;<br />\nmore than Baseball, Tennis,<br />\nCross-Country, Track, Golf, and<br />\nWrestling? So, since 1952, there have<br />\nbeen only three years in which we have<br />\nnot won at least one team and one<br />\nindividual championship?<br />\nIf you believe that Athletics at<br />\nHopkins is to serve the students, then<br />\nsign the petition that is being circulated<br />\nin the dorms.<br />\nVance Tiede<br />\nCaptain JHU Fencing<br />\nTeam 1968-'69<br />\nPOOR JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nPerhaps the most exciting event to<br />\nhappen in the last few days was the<br />\nappearance of Lincoln Gordon at the<br />\nmeeting of the student body on Friday.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at:<br />\n<br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest italian food in town<br />\n<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\n<br />\nOf course it meant the arrest of three<br />\nmembers of that body on various drug<br />\ncharges, but what a small price to pay<br />\nfor the appearance of our leader.

The issue I am referring to is<br />\nthe University's decision (Gordon and his Administrators',<br />\nnot the Athletic Department's) to drop five sports from<br />\nnext year's intercollegiate schedule. These sports are<br />\nTrack, Cross-Country, Tennis, Golf, and Fencing.<br />\nAlthough the overall budget has been increased from $200,000<br />\nto $245,000, the abolition of these sports by Dr. Gordon and the<br />\nhigher-ups in his Administration hierarchy is deplorable, and it must<br />\nbe appealed through proper channels. The total savings of this<br />\narbitrary economy move is a small $14,240 (this figure does not<br />\ninclude necessary equipment replacement).<br />\nThe move, which effects over 25% of all those Hopkins<br />\nathletes participating in intercollegiates, came as a surprise to all<br />\nexcept those responsible for making the decision, which had been<br />\nshrouded in secrecy since its formulation a week ago last Monday,<br />\nand its eventual seepage to individuals on last Monday. It is hard,<br />\ngiven the evasive nature of Bilgrave's statements, to pin to blame on<br />\nany one Administrator, but the buck stops with our fearless and<br />\nuntil recently innocuous President, Lincoln \"Shylock\" Gordon. He<br />\nhas to assume full blame for this ill-advised economy move.<br />\nFurther Tragedy<br />\nIt is further tragic that none of the student-athletes or<br />\npart-time coaches were consulted before this decision was made. In<br />\nfact the Athletic Committee's recommendations from last semester<br />\nwere ignored except for the principle that if a cutback had to be<br />\nmade it should come in the intercollegiate area. The point is a cut<br />\nshould not come. Cloaked in secrecy, the decision came as a<br />\ncomplete surprise to Paul Allen and Dennis Estis - the two students<br />\non the Committee of Physical Education. It is obvious now that this<br />\nCommittee was disbanded too soon as most of their<br />\nrecommendations have gone unheard in the offices of the<br />\nAdministration's Elite.<br />\nI argue that an assertive drive by the Alumni Office and the<br />\nother possible fund-raising bodies of the University could have<br />\nscared up the comparatively small sum of money needed to finance<br />\nthese five sports. In Mr. Bilgrave's words, \"money is tight.\" In our<br />\nwords, the University is even tighter. We aren't asking for miracles,<br />\nbut we are asking the university to at least try to raise the money.<br />\nHow many of you readers knew that there was a possibility of these<br />\nsports being dropped?<br />\nThis is symptomatic of a larger question: up to now, student<br />\ninvolvement in University decision-making has been more tokenism<br />\nthan reality. Why weren't students notified through proper channels<br />\nrather than having to find out through the grapevine? What kind of a<br />\nUniversity are you running, Dr. Gordon? This is not the State<br />\nDepartment. You can make your identity known instead of hiding<br />\nbehind the topcoats of your Administrators.<br />\nThe University has not begun to exhaust all possibilities for<br />\nraising the money. The cutting of the Athletic Budget does not even<br />\nbegin to solve the problem for, according to Bilgrave, other<br />\nintercollegiate sports might have to be abandoned in the future.<br />\nLet's stop this trend now and reverse the tide, if possible. Track,<br />\ncross-country, golf, tennis, and fencing must be brought back.<br />\nThe Student Council has set up a Committee with Gus<br />\nSlotman as Chairman to open a dialogue with the Administration.<br />\nWe hope that talks do not get bogged down in Committee but that<br />\nsome positive action, such as reinstatement of these sports without<br />\njeopardy to the rest of the budget requests, be taken. Given the<br />\nfacts, what would the Alumni think if on Homecoming the Varsity<br />\nLacrosse team refused to play Navy? Of course, being rational<br />\npeople, we do not favor such an action, but something must be<br />\ndone. The only solution which we endorse is full reinstatement of<br />\nthese sports in the intercollegiate program.<br />\nI have my own ideas as to how the money should be raised.<br />\nShort and long range financial responsibility lies with the University.<br />\nYou can bleed the students just so much (i.e. increases in tuition,<br />\nactivity fees, reduction in scholarships) before they will rebel. That<br />\nline of distinction is drawing close.<br />\nThe ideal situation would be an endowment fund for the<br />\nAthletic Department. If the Admissions charge passes, the money<br />\ntaken in from gate receipts should go to an Athletic Endowment<br />\nFund rather than into the University's general kitty. Meanwhile, Dr.<br />\nGordon should direct the Alumni Office to raise money for this fund<br />\nwhile still directing the University to shoulder full financial<br />\nresponsibility for a FULL Athletic Budget (none of this marginal<br />\ngarbage) which would include these five sports. Come on, Dr.<br />\n!Gordon, quit being stingy. If you can't find the $14,240 why don't<br />\nOu're\u00a7igh.and let the BbardbfTrastees find someone who can?<br />\n<br />\n0 ril<br />\n4<br />\n444<br />\n<br />\n\u00b0<br />\n<br />\n,, \u2022 ,111<br />\nRAP,<br />\n<br />\nby<br />\n<br />\n41\u2018 m74;<br />\n<br />\nHONORABLE MENTION ALL AMERICAN Charlie \"C.C.\" Coker fends off Army sticker. \"C.C.\" rifled 6 goals int<br />\nthe Army nets.

Presently, WJHU-AM is<br />\nlicensed to broadcast only within the<br />\ndormitory area with the option of<br />\nhaving telephone connections to<br />\nneighboring houses.<br />\nBilgrave sent a memorandum to<br />\nPresident Gordon February 17<br />\nexplaining his cvaluation of WJHU's<br />\nrequest. Bilgrave, while praising the staff<br />\nand the general operation on the<br />\nstudent station said \"the station was not<br />\nready\"for FM operation. He cited the<br />\nhigh cost for the new radio facilities, the<br />\ninexperience of the staff and the dearth<br />\nof student FM receivers.<br />\nStation manager Ewalt said<br />\nBilgrave's objections were unfounded.<br />\n\"We can train the people,\" he replied to<br />\nthe second Bilgrave objection, and he<br />\nrejected the first contention as<br />\nnearsighted. \"This(FM broadcasting) is<br />\nthe chance for us to get out and do<br />\nsomething instead of the fun-and-games<br />\ntype of operation we have now. We can<br />\nre-broadcast sports, campus lectures and<br />\nother worthwhile Hopkins activities.<br />\nThis will give us a totally different<br />\nconcept of running a station and it<br />\nwould affect, with this year's staff I'm<br />\nsure a favorable effect, Hopkins' image<br />\nto the Greater Baltimore community.\"<br />\nThe newly-elected station manager for<br />\nnext year, Baird Thompson,agreed with<br />\nEwalt. \"If we could do this, there would<br />\nbe a voice for the Hopkins community<br />\nin Baltimore,\" he said.<br />\n2 Month Wait<br />\n/<br />\n11<br />\nJohn Ewalt stated that after the<br />\nBilgrave letter in February, he tried to<br />\nget an appointment with Dr. Gordon to<br />\n2<br />\n/<br />\ndiscuss the FM proposals. After a 11<br />\nmonth wait, Gordon met with the<br />\nWJHU Board of Control in their<br /><br />\ndormitory radio room. Ewalt said he<br />\nalso invited Plant Manager Wes Taylor<br />\nto the itiformal meeting. Taylor, he<br />\nstated, casually mentioned in the<br />\ndiscussions that WJHU's request \"was<br />\nnot a high priority item,\" meaning,<br />\nEwalt said, it was being discarded.<br />\n\"Bilgrave hadn't told me about it<br />\nbeing scrapped, Ewalt asserted, \"He<br />\nprobably thought let it ride' since I'm a<br />\nsenior and will soon be gone.\" However,<br />\nEwalt and Thompson said that Gordon<br />\nasked Taylor for a reevaluation of the<br />\nstatiorrs request. \"Gordon was<br />\nsomewhat nebulous on his stand on the<br />\nmatter, although he seemed impressed<br />\nwith our operation,\" claimed Ewalt,<br />\n\"Taylor was asked by Gordon who did<br />\nthe recommending, but Taylor wouldn't \u2022<br />\nmention names and just said that other<br />\nstudent projects were more important.\"<br />\nBilgrave Replies<br />\nThe Director of Student Affairs<br />\nsaid that WJHU's request needs more<br />\ntime to be discussed. He cited his<br />\ntwo major objections to the project: the<br />\n$22,000 cost for the new outlay, and<br />\nthe question of who should run the<br />\nstation since it would be the university's<br />\nspokesman, \"Maybe this shouldn't be<br />\nrun by students, maybe the public<br />\nrelations department should run it. I<br />\ndon't know, it needs to be discussed,\"<br />\nBilgrave explained. He again said there<br />\nare other student activities which will be<br />\nof greater benefit for the students than<br />\nthe FM station.<br />\nEwalt agreed with Bilgrave's<br />\ncontention that the radio station has<br />\nnot been ignored by university subsidies<br />\nin the past. \"Two years ago our budget<br />\nwas $700 a year and its operation<br />\nreflected that,\" said Ewalt. The present<br />\nbudget allots $2,600 to WJHU. Ewalt<br />\nexplained this high figure reflected a<br />\nnumber of expensive capital<br />\nimprovements on the station this year.<br />\nThe value of the station's equipment (its<br />\nrecords are mainly free promotional<br />\ncopies) amounts to around $10,000.<br />\nDorm Listenership<br />\nIn return for this investment,<br />\nWJHU provides varied music programs<br />\nseven nights a week, plus Saturday and<br />\nSunday afternoon shows. Ewalt believed<br />\nthat about 70-75 per cent of the<br />\ndormitory residents listen to the campus<br />\nstation at least once a week. One of the<br />\ndisk jockeys,Steve Henderson, estimated<br />\nup to 35 per cent of the freshmen tune<br />\nin on an average night. Besides the<br />\ndorms, WJHU broadcasts, via telephone<br />\nconnections, to three fraternities, ZBT,<br />\nTEP and Sig Ep.<br />\nThis Monday Ewalt talked to<br />\nVice-President Ross Jones concerning<br />\nthe station's programming plan if they<br />\nreceive money to go FM. Ewalt said the<br />\nproposed station would mainly<br />\nbroadcast music with special programs<br />\ncovering Hopkins' events. \"He seemed<br />\nfavorable to our ideas; I think he will<br />\nrecommend us,\" Ewalt said.<br /><br />\nCramer Chosen New Dook<br /><br />\nCiting \"personal\" reasons,<br />\nNews-Letter editor Bruce Drake<br />\nresigned from the paper, effective<br />\nApril 24, 1969.

Parmly observed. He said he knew of nothing in<br />\nmilitary or civilian law that required students to act as<br />\ninformers.<br />\nIn a News-Letter interview, the ROTC Commander<br />\nalso expressed support of an all-volunteer army,spoke of<br />\ninternal' reforms in the ROTC program, listed the<br />\nadvantages of ROTC instruction on university campuses<br />\nand outlined his plan of action in the case of a student<br />\ntakeover of the ROTC building.<br />\nCol. Parmly, a 26-year veteran of Army service,<br />\nvoiced support of proposals for an all-volunteer army<br />\nwith the reservation that the new army \"would fulfill<br />\nthe basic requirements of the self-preservation of our<br />\ncountry.\" \"There is nothing better than volunteers,\" he<br />\nsaid, explaining that they have \"superior morale.\"<br />\n-Parmly was a volunteer paratrooper and special forces<br />\ngreen beret.<br />\nHe stated that a volunteer army would be no<br />\nthreat to the country because, \"The Congress and its<br />\nconstituents wouldn't allow the army to be<br />\nself-perpetuating.\" Parmly's background is steeped in<br />\nmilitary tradition. His grandfather, father, brothers and<br />\nhis wife's family all attended military schools. \"My<br />\nfamily is so ingrained in the military that I am suspect.<br />\nBut I am completely faithful and obedient to our<br />\ncountry,\" he said. \"I wouldn't support any Army<br />\ntakeover foolishness in the name of patriotism.\"<br />\nSlow Reform<br />\n\"Reform would have been carried out anyway,\"<br />\nParmly replied in regard to the many student and faculty<br />\ndemands nation wide for liberalization of the ROTC<br />\nprogram. In 1964, he stated, the University of Ohio<br />\nrecommended to the Secretary of the Army a number of<br />\nreforms to \"relate ROTC of the 1960's with the<br />\nuniversity of the 1960's, having in view the coming<br />\ndecade.\" The Secretary of the Army rejected the Ohio<br />\nplan last Friday, Parmly said, but issued to the ROTC<br />\nCommanders a modified plan for cadet instruction.<br />\nCol. Parmly asserted that the Hopkins branch had<br />\nalready altered its program several years ago. There has<br />\nbeen a 25 per cent reduction in the hours recommended<br />\nfor cadet training, the commander observed. He<br />\nexplained the reduction reflected the higher quality of<br />\nteaching by professors at Homewood. Many of the cadet<br />\ncourses were scrapped, he stated, because they<br />\noverlapped university courses which were \"better<br />\ntaught.\" The Army now is emphasizing courses in<br />\ndiplomacy and foreign policy to its ROTC cadets,<br />\nParmly observed.<br />\nRotsy Relevancy<br />\nThere are three reasons ROTC is still relevant on<br />\nthe college campus, the Colonel stated. First, the ROTC<br />\nprogram \"is directly related to college. You must have a<br />\nbaccalaureate degree to graduate from ROTC,\"<br /><br />\nGuerrilla Theater 'Educates' Hopkins<br />\nLast Monday, members of the New<br />\nUniversity Conference (NUC) staged the first in<br />\nseries of Guerrilla Theaters aimed at<br />\n:educating the University community\" to the<br />\n'atrocities of the war.\"<br />\nThe NUC'S activities were part of a week-long<br />\nProgram, ending on Wednesday, May 7,<br />\nbeing<br />\nConducted in conjunction with the Students for a<br />\nDemocratic Society (SDS). Dean Papas, a worker at the<br />\nPeace Action Center, stated that there are no planned<br />\nactivities for the week. \"Like the Viet Cong, we'll strike<br />\nat unexpected places and unexpected times.\"<br />\n,<br />\nThe members of last week's theater production<br />\nleft Levering Hall at four o'clock and made their way to<br />\nthe ROTC drill field. Among the participants were \"Viet<br />\nCong,\" the \"Draft Board,\" \"Uncle Sam\" and Dean Papas<br />\ndressed as Lincoln Gordon.<br />\nIn acting out the play, the NUC attempted to<br />\nrepresent the ambivalent attitudes of the University<br />\ntowards both the Draft Boards and Viet Nam.\"Lincoln<br />\n,Gordon\" for example, was pictured as eating a small<br />\nbaby. When those who played students chanted,\"Why<br />\nare you eating Brazil?\" Gordon responded,\"It's a lesson<br />\nI learned when I was working for the government.\"<br />\nAs the play was being staged on the field, ROTC<br />\nCommanders marched their troops around the<br />\ndemonstrators, apparently oblivious to their presence.<br />\nLarry Dannels, Housemaster of Jennings and Platoon<br />\nSergeant of Alpha Company was one of the few to take<br />\nnotice. \"Let's continue to look good. Let's be a<br />\nCompany,\" he screamed.<br />\nAlthough each group took up major portions of<br />\nthe field, neither's activities impeded those of the other.<br />\nCo!. Eleazar Parmly, Commander of the ROTC unit on<br />\nHomewood, stated that \"They have done absolutely<br />\nnothing that is contrary to good order and discipline.\"<br />\nCol. Parmly did state, however, that \"I hope their<br />\neffort is not to disrupt for the sake of disruption.\"<br />\nThe degree of planning and the care with which the<br /><br />\nNUC demonstrators organized their activities attracted<br />\nthe praise of Parmly. \"Anyone who has planned his<br />\noperations to the extent that they have is entitled to an<br />\naudience.\"<br />\nR.S.V.P.<br />\nCol. Parmly invitedthemembers of the NUC to<br />\n\"come to my office with legitimate inquiries.\" After all,<br />\nhe argued ,\"we're in the best position to present the<br />\nfacts.\"<br />\nWhen asked if the demonstrations appeared to<br />\naffect his troops, Parmly said,\"Since it'san all volunteer<br />\nprogram, I don't think many are influenced. It had no<br />\n,other effect on me other than amusement.\"<br />\nAfter the NUC army troops \"killed\" both<br />\n\"Gordon\" and the \"Draft Board\" they grouped<br />\npeacefully and left the field. They plan other such plays<br />\nthroughout the week.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS' GRADUATE STUDENTS march for the New<br />\nUniversity Conferencte',s Guerrilla Theatre.<br />\nAr<br /><br />\nCommander Parmly explained. His second reason was<br />\nthat a university affiliation keeps the Army subordinate<br />\n, to civilian controls. \"If the intellectual community of<br />\nthe United States is going to influence its students of the<br />\n\u2022 officer's corp, then they can do it the best on their own<br />\ncampuses,\" he said.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nParmly stated that attempts to end ROTC<br />\nactivities on the campuses have met defeat in the<br />\nCongress. He believed this was \"because it (ROTC's<br />\n\u2022 removal) would be one of the final blocks to stop what<br />\nhas been freely-described as the 'military mind.' I thin tc I<br />\nam one of those they would say has a 'military mind.'\"<br />\nCol. Parmly also characterized the members<br />\nopposed to ROTC. \"We have individuals in our society<br />\nwhose personality is bent on sadism and not based on<br />\nmoral codes,\" he asserted. He furthermore stated,<br />\n\"When hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of<br />\nequipment has been damaged (at ROTC buildings) this is<br />\nserious in my book.\"<br />\nThe ROTC Commander said that \"If I was asked<br />\nto leave this building (by a student group), I would first<br />\nask for their authority. I have the authority from the<br />\nuniversity as a professor of military science to be<br />\nhere....lt would be unmanly and disloyal to the<br />\nuniversity for me to agree to leave for no reason.\"<br /><br />\nSDS Demands End<br />\nTo Army Presence<br /><br />\n\"A U.S. ARMY SOLDIER\" AND \"LINCOLN GORDON\"<br />\nCONFER about SDS demands for the abolition of ROTC.<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br /><br />\nThe SDS letter to President Gordon was the most<br />\nstrongly worded of the three letters. The three page<br />\nletter delved into an analysis of why Hopkins should not<br />\nallow ROTC on campus, as well as expanding the<br />\ndemands from merely an exclusion of ROTC from the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe SDS demand of the abolition of ROTC went<br />\ninto more specifics than the NUC letter. It asked that<br />\n\"ROTC have no access to University facilities on any<br />\nbasis; that there be no contractual relation between the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University and the U.S. Army for the<br />\ntraining of officers on a curricular or extra-curricular<br />\nbasis and that students who are currently receiving<br />\nROTC scholarships be given equivalent Hopkins<br />\nUniversity scholarships.\"<br />\nBeyond the issue of ROTC on campus, the SDS<br />\nmoved into a general attack on all manifestations of the<br />\nmilitary on campus. This consisted of calling for the<br />\nabolition, in addition to ROTC, of all \"military,<br />\ncounter-insurgency and pacification and social control<br />\nresearch.\"<br />\nSDS also called for the abolition of \"recruiting by<br />\nthe military and the Armed Services, by all<br />\nmilitary-connected Government Agencies, and by all<br />\nCorporations which produce war and social control<br />\nmaterial for use at home or abroad.\"<br />\nROTC Informers, NUC Claims<br />\nThe NUC had previously charged that ROTC men<br />\ncould \"be required to play the...informer role...,<br />\nconcerning beliefs and political associations of their<br />\nfellow students.\" Certain provisions of the U. S. Military<br />\nrules for prospective officers were cited as a<br />\ndemonstration of this.<br />\nThe form specifically referred to turned out to be<br />\nfor those who apply to the Military Intelligence Branch,<br />\nand is normally filled out during the second semester of<br />\nsenior year.<br />\nDespite the equivocation of the NUC charge, the<br />\norganization still felt that \"the existence of the Reserve<br />\nOfficers' Training Corps on the Hopkins Campus raises<br />\nfundamental questions about the nature of this academic<br />\ncommunity,\" as the NUC letter to President Gordon put<br />\nit.<br />\nThrough the activities for the coming weeks the<br />\nNUC-SDS coalition hopes to develop and intensify<br />\nanti-ROTC feeling on campus.

In<br />\nconjunction with a professor from Lehigh University,<br />\nDr. Hogan administered the California Psychological<br />\nInventory and a biographical questionnaire to 76<br />\nstudents from Hopkins and 72 from Lehigh.<br />\nAmong the conclusions presented in the paper is<br />\nthat \"users' and principled non-users are<br />\nindistinguishable in terms of extra-curricular activities,<br />\nyear in school or academic achievemen-t.\"<br />\nThe paper was presented at the conference of<br />\npsychologists in Philadelphia and was, in Dr. Hogan's<br />\nwords, \"extremely well received.\" The 76 Hopkins<br />\nstudents who were interviewed did not reveal their<br />\nidentities to the interviewers.

On the other hand, they also tend to be<br />\nimpulsive, pleasure-seeking and somewhat rebellious.\"<br />\nPrincipled non-users (a term which was only<br />\nrecently substituted for \"adamant non-users\") displayed<br />\nvery different .characteristics. They \"showed no clearly<br />\ndefined academic preferences, and were responsible and<br />\nrule-abiding. However, they also tended to be rigid,<br />\nconventional and narrow in their interests.\"<br />\nThe report also concluded that users and<br />\nprincipled non-users were virtually indistinguishable<br />\nfrom one another in terms of social maturity. Moreover,<br />\nboth groups appeared to be less than \"morally mature\"<br />\nwith regard to their performance on two indices<br />\ndesigned to predict moral behavior.<br />\nDr. Hogan's personal beliefs about users differ<br />\nfrom those which his data suggested.

However, little is actually<br />\nknown about the drug or its effects at<br />\nthis time.<br />\nOne of the reasons for the scarcity<br />\nof information is that reseachers have a<br />\ndifficult time obtaining high grade<br />\nmarijuana for testing purposes. To<br />\noffset this shortage, the government has<br />\nrecently stepped in and become the<br />\nlargest single producer of the drug in the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nAnother<br />\nproblem involved<br />\nin research of this<br />\nNEWS<br />\nkind is the lack of<br />\ncornmunication<br />\nbetween researchFEATURE<br />\ners investigating<br />\nthe drug from<br />\ndifferent angles.<br />\nSince biologists, pathologists,<br />\npsychologists, sociologists,<br />\npharmacologists and lawyers have<br />\nentered the field, there exists no<br />\nclearing-house for information which<br />\nsamples the findings from every field.<br />\n\"This is one of the<br />\nworst-researched areas known to man\"<br />\nsaid Dr. Sidney Cohen, chief of the<br />\nDivision of Narcotic Addiction and<br />\nDrug Abuse of the National Institute of<br />\nHealth, in Bethesda, Md.<br />\nThousands of Years<br />\nThe fact that so little is known<br />\nabout marijuana is surprising in light of<br />\nthe fact that records of its use\u2014for<br />\nmedicinal, religious or hedonistic<br />\nreasons\u2014have been ,found dating back<br />\nthousands of year's.<br /><br />\nThe reasons for the recent<br />\nincrease in the volume of research are<br />\nalso reasons for the scarcity of<br />\nknowledge about marijuana. Many more<br />\ngrants and much more equipment and<br />\nassistance is available now to the<br />\nscien tis t who wishes to explore<br />\nmarijuana's effects. It has been the<br />\ndiscovery of increased usage at colleges,<br />\nhigh schools and even junior high<br />\nschools, which has increased public<br />\nconcern and made resources more<br />\navailable to researchers.<br />\nHowever, the fact that public<br />\nopinion is so intimately connected with<br />\nthe present research is also a detrimental<br />\nfactor. Much of what is known, or<br />\nbelieved about the drug, comes from<br />\nattitudes developed out of superstition<br />\nor fear\u2014an attitude stemming all the<br />\nway back to America's puritan<br />\nbeginnings.<br />\nBiased Work Useless<br />\nAccording to Dr. Helen W.<br />\nNowlis, Professor of Psychology at the<br />\nUniversity of Rochester, much of the<br />\nresearch being conducted today is<br />\nuseless, simply because the researchers,<br />\nand the public are so highly opinionated<br />\non the subject of marijuana.<br />\n\"What I see happening today,\"<br />\nshe said, \"is a lot of research being<br />\nconducted with an eye toward proving<br />\nthat marijuana is harmful or trying to<br />\nprove that it is harmless.\" In either case,<br />\nshe stated, the bias of the researcher,<br />\nthe fact that he is trying to justify one<br />\nor the other opinion about the drug,<br />\ninvalidates most of the research effort.<br />\nWhat is needed, she continued, is<br />\nresearch conducted merely to find out<br />\nmore than we already know. There is<br />\nvery little of this significant research<br />\nbeing conducted today,she said.<br /><br />\nDr. Nowlis believes that Cannabis<br />\n(the generic name for marijuana), like<br />\nmost drugs, may be harmful for some<br />\npeople, in certain dosages, and under<br />\ncertain circumstances. In her book,<br />\nDrugs on the College Campus, however,<br />\nshe states that \"When cannabis is<br />\ncompared with alcohol, amphetamines,<br />\nbarbiturates, nicotine, opiates and many<br />\nother drugs, its potential for risk and for<br />\nabuse appears to be relatively low.\"<br />\nSome of the most frightening<br />\nresearch results which have been<br />\nrevealed recently have come from the<br />\nUniversity of Georgia in Augusta. There,<br />\nDr. William F. Geber, Associate<br />\nProfessor of Pharmacology, in the<br />\nmedical school at Augusta, has<br />\nproduced dead or malformed fetuses in<br />\nhamster and rabbit litters, by injecting<br />\nthe mother with large quantities of resin<br />\ndrawn from the marijuana plant.<br />\nDr. Geber said that the extent of<br />\nmalformation or death varied almost<br />\ndirectly with the dosage levels<br />\nadministered. In addition, there was a<br />\ndifference when the injection was drawn<br />\nfrom plants grown in New Jersey, or<br />\nfrom marijuana grown in Mexico (which<br />\nis generally more potent).<br />\nDr. Geber was careful to include,<br />\nhowever, that at low dosages (still<br />\nconsiderably higher than the<br />\nconcentration obtainable in a human<br />\nbeing), there was no malformation of<br />\nfetuses. He added that the research in<br />\nwhich he was presently engaged<br />\nprovided little solid knowledge on the<br />\neffects of marijuana in the human.<br />\nResearch more directly applicable<br />\nto human consumption is being<br />\nconducted at the New York Medical<br />\nCollege, where a team of scientists are,<br />\nfeeding electro-encephalogram graphs<br /><br />\ninto a computer.

If the<br />\nstudents wish the University to leave them alone and allow them to persue<br />\ntheir own course with regard to moral and social matters, it is inconsistent<br />\nto believe that the University should reassume its position in loco parentis<br />\nwhen its students get in trouble.<br />\nDr. Gordon made it abundantly clear that the University could offer<br />\nno protection once it had abandoned its role as the keeper of morality and<br />\nlegality on the campus. The logic of this position is inarguable and we<br />\nonly regret that the students in the dormitories were not made completely<br />\naware of this at the beginning of the year.<br />\nHowever, to contend that the University has no responsibility in a<br />\n-case such as the current police action is an oversimplification. The<br />\nUniversity compels all freshman to live in the dormitories on campus.<br />\nThough it has completely divested itself of responsibility for what<br />\nstudents do, it remains in firm control of where they do it.<br />\nWhen one acciimulates five-hundred people between the ages of 17<br />\nand 22 in two buildings, there is going to be a significant percentage of<br />\nresidents who smoke marijuana. The students know this, the police know<br />\nit, and the University should know it. A dormitory full of grass is more<br />\nthan fair game for a bust. Paid student informers and other undercover<br />\ninformation sources are common in such a situation.<br />\nWhat the University has done, then, is to give the students full<br />\nresponsibility for their actions. But it has also made the students(who are<br />\nsupposed to \"take their own chances\") sitting ducks for informers and<br />\npolice action of this kind.<br />\nWhat is also disturbing in a larger sense is that our administrators<br />\nwere so completely stunned by last week's bust. It is comforting to know<br />\nthat the University had no part in the action. However, the failure to<br />\nprepare, even in the most basic manner, for such an eventuality, reflects a<br />\nfailure either in reasoning or in communication.<br />\nIf the administration was aware of the amount of marijuana in the<br />\ndormitories, it must also have been aware of the possibility of a bust. If<br />\nthe officials knew of smoking in the dorms, why was the University<br />\nreaction to a raid not considered? On the other hand, Dr. Gordon and<br />\nothers have implied that most administrators underestimated drug activity<br />\non campus. If this is the case, there is a surprising ignorance on the part of<br />\nadministrators regarding conditions in the dormitories. The drug activity<br />\nin the dormitories has been only too evident since September. If the<br /><br />\nt(K<br /><br />\nIn Support of the Teach-In<br />\nIt has become increasingly clear in the last three years that the goal<br />\nof the American military establishment are not consistent with the spirit or<br />\npurpose of a free academic community. The activities of the military as a<br />\nforce for suppression both in this country and abroad make it imperative<br />\nthat Hopkins divest itself of any association with the armed forces.<br />\nThe fact that ROTC students no longer receive academic credits for<br />\ntheir activities does not alter the University's tacit complicity in the<br />\nefforts and program of the military. The presence of the armed forces or<br />\ntheir training wings on campus can do nothing but compromise the<br />\nprinciple of free inquiry and thought on which the University must stand.<br />\nFor these reasons, we support SDS and the NUC in their teach-in this<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nHowever, there lingers the question of how much good removing<br />\nROTC from the campus will do. According to military experts, SDS is<br />\nwrong in its contention that the elimination of ROTC from the campuses<br />\nwill appreciably hurt the armed forces of the U.S. There are many ways<br />\nby which the Army could insure a continuing flow of officers into the<br />\nservice. The eradication of ROTC will not hurt the military or even alter<br />\nits role in the society significantly.<br />\nIf SDS is sincere in its attempt to combat militarism in this country,<br />\nits attack on ROTC is ill-targeted. A much greater effect on the power and<br />\ninfluence of the army in America could be achieved by concentration on<br />\ndraft resistance. Whereas the Army does not need ROTC to train officers,<br />\nit does need the draft to supply manpower.<br />\nWe support the teach-in today, therefore, in that we agree with the<br />\nanalysis of the goals of the University which is propounded by the NUC<br />\nand SDS.<br />\nROTC is philosophically and idealogically an anomaly at Hopkins. It<br />\nmust be stated,.however, that in terms of pratical effect on the military in<br />\nAmerica, the current offensive is futile.<br /><br />\nA Sporting Chance<br />\nThe recent decision to eliminate five sports from intercollegiate<br />\ncompetition is reprehensible on two counts. First, there is the obvious fact<br />\nthat by cutting these five sports, in which over one-fourth of the<br />\nUniversity's intercollegiate athletes are involved, the administration has<br />\nsaved only $14,240. The total athletic budget, some $245,000, has not<br />\nbeen significantly decreased by the elimination of these sports. Moreover,<br />\nno public attempt was made by the University to secure sufficient funds<br />\nto continue the sports. Chances are, if a public appeal were made,<br />\ncontributions from alumni would more than supply the teams.<br />\nSecond and even more disturbing is the way in which the. University<br />\nmade and announced this decision. Not only was there no public appeal,<br />\nbut people intimately connected with the athletic department as well as<br />\nconcerned students were taken by surprise by the move. We hope that<br />\nevery effort will be made to rescue these intercollegiate sports from<br />\noblivion. Moreover, we hope that in the future, the administration will see<br />\nfit to consult those affected by their decisions before those decisions are<br />\nmade.<br /><br />\nAMP IU RAVE PANS<br />\nIN MY BACK AtJp<br />\nGlioRTmEss OF<br /><br />\nAMP RI_ 9-10KE Too<br />\nMxH AND HAVE A<br />\n2RIK)1036 PROBLEM.<br /><br />\nAMP<br /><br />\nHAVE A 500-<br /><br />\nDon l'ilbli.hery Hall syndicate 194,1<br /><br />\nni_<br />\nTRIG.<br /><br />\nI &lt;<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\nUniversity officials had not noticed it by April, we can only conclude that<br />\nthey lacked the concern to look.<br />\nThis lack of concern is not startling.

If this requirement is maintained, the<br />\nadministration will have to acknowledge that it retains a measure of its<br />\nresponsibility toward the students. If students must live on campus, the<br />\nUniversity must do everything it can to keep police off.

So, when the bust actually did<br />\ncome, last Thursday night, I was surprised.<br />\nI was sitting in a friend's room reading, of all<br />\nthings, a Jerry Rubin manifesto in Evergreen.

My God, I thought,<br />\nmy chance has arrived! Normally, of course, I would<br />\nhave merely glanced out the window, and then gone to<br />\nbed. But after reading the Rubin manifesto, to do<br />\nanything but run outside and join the crowd would have<br />\nbeen selling out.<br />\nI ran over to Royce and Sylvester, and I was happy<br />\nto see an angry crowd milling about. Then I realized- A<br />\nBUST! The rumors were true.

When two students were led,<br />\nhandcuffed, to the police, the crowd trailed behind<br />\nthem, hooting and jeering deliriously. The hoarse, angry,<br />\ncathartic cheers swept the crow&amp; like a mania. PIGS!<br />\nPIGS! PIGS! Here, on the placid Hopkins campus, kids<br />\nwere shouting like Yippics in Chicago.<br />\nThe police car in the road was quickly surrounded<br />\nby chanting kids.

He<br />\nonce made a blazing speech indicating<br />\nthat the South was being ignored in<br />\nAmerican history for the benefit of New<br />\nEngland; that the South was a land of<br />\ndoers, but that New England was a land<br />\nof writers.<br />\nThus, he said, the little love affairs<br />\nof New England had been portrayed as<br />\nepic romances; the skirmishes on New<br />\nEngland soil had been glorified and<br />\ncredited, in one case, with the \"shot<br />\nheard round the world.\"<br />\nThis speech was criticized as<br />\nignorant. In fact there is no doubt that<br />\nfor protracted periods American literary<br />\nand historical writing has been<br />\ndominated by New Englanders. Thomas<br />\nWentworth Higginson wrote in 1862<br />\nthat \"the organizing New England<br /><br />\nmind\" was required to produce<br />\nAmerican literature. Historical literature<br />\nwas emanating from the same place, in<br />\nsuch persons as Parkman, Prescott,<br />\nBancroft and Fiske. This face was noted<br />\nby Frederick Jackson Turner and,<br />\nwhatever his other faults, Turner did<br />\ninspire some serious study of Western<br />\nregions.<br />\nJefferson Wrote Better<br />\nClark's enthusiasm definitely led<br />\nhim to excesses. For instance, he said<br />\nthat John Adams was held in higher<br />\nregard than Jefferson, although<br />\nJefferson was much more intelligent,<br />\nbecause Adams was a better writer. It is<br />\nhard to believe that a conspicuous<br />\ndelegate to the turn-of-the-century<br />\nDemocratic National Conventions<br />\nwould consider Adams to be held in<br />\nhigher regard than Jefferson. Adams, by<br />\nhis own testimony, knew that Jefferson<br />\nwrote better than he did.<br />\nNevertheless, Clark's<br />\nmiscellaneous writings show a good<br />\ngrasp of history. He wrote no large-scale<br />\nhistorical work, save his own memoirs.<br />\nHe did write a scattered series of<br />\nsketches and essays which compare<br />\nfavorably with the historical work of<br />\nWilson. Wilson's writing style was often<br />\neloquent, but at times affected.<br />\nWilson also has a distressing<br /><br />\ntendency to give insufficient support to<br />\nhis generalizations. Clark wrote lucidly,<br />\nemphasizing facts and making<br />\ninterpretations that followed his facts<br />\nrather closely. For instance, he gave a<br />\ngood characterization of John Randolph<br />\nof Roanoke, that Randolph seemed to<br />\nhave read everything and forgoten<br />\nalmost nothing.<br />\nHesitant Voter<br />\nClark also expressed his pride that<br />\nit was a Missouri Senator, Republican<br />\n\u2022Senator Henderson, who cast the<br />\ndecisive vote against the attempt to<br />\nremove President Johnson from office.<br />\nThis is of interest, since the writings of<br />\nD.W. Brogan and John F. Kennedy have<br />\nemphasized the role of the hesitant<br />\nSenator Edmund G. Ross.<br />\nObviously, since the impeachment<br />\nfailed by one vote, any one of nineteen<br />\nvotes (even those of the Democrats)<br />\nmay be claimed as the decisive one. But<br />\nit may be suggested that the Senator<br />\nwho hesitated longest in deciding how<br />\nto vote was not the most courageous.<br />\nClark's general political position<br />\nwas progressive. He supported the secret<br />\nballot, the initiative and referendum,<br />\nand reductions in tarriff rates. He was<br />\nnot explicit on all issues, but it would<br />\nbe foolhardy to portray him as a<br />\nreactionary in conflict with the<br />\nprogressive Wilson.<br /><br />\nClark and Wilson did have one<br />\ngreat conflict. In 1917 Clark was<br />\nSpeaker of the House, a position whose<br />\nauthority he had helped to undercut in<br />\nthe \"Revolution of 1910\" against<br />\n\"Czar\" Joseph Cannon. Clark could<br />\nhave used more authority in 1917, when<br />\nhe fought vainly against Wilson's request<br />\nfor conscription. Carlk said, \"There is<br />\nprecious little difference between<br />\n'conscript' and 'convict.\" Surely Clark<br />\ndeserves a place among the pantheon of<br />\nheroes of the S.D.S.<br />\nBut Clark's managers did not give<br />\nside<br />\nsufficient stress to the intellectual<br />\ni<br />\nMissour<br />\nof his nature. In 1912, the<br />\nfor,<br />\nhim<br />\ned<br />\nsuggest<br />\nhad<br />\ntion<br />\nState Conven<br />\nPresident to the insinuating strains 01<br />\nthe Houn'.

What appalls me is that the writer seems to<br />\nadvocate the university's becoming involved in some way<br />\nWith \"...the study of art in a creative...context.\"<br />\nI am by now convinced that the only thing that<br />\nnu-going, creative art, in any medium, needs for its<br />\ncun.tinual replenishing and revivifying are human powers,<br />\nwhich must be left as unencumbered as possible by any<br />\ngrouP, organization, social structuring or curriculum. An<br />\norepanized, socially constructed context, such as a<br />\nUniversity affords, inevitably has the same effect on the<br />\nProcesses of artistic creation as anti-matter has on<br />\ntatter: the two are annihilated upon collision.<br />\n, It is not surprising that no great creative artist has<br />\n'Peen found to be sustained and nurtured by any<br />\n!eademy, college, or other intellectual in-gathering.<br />\n.1kdeed, quartets-, writers-, and artists-in-residence at<br />\nvarious campuses are regarded as something of<br />\nari<br />\na omalies and appear to be almost supinely captive<br />\nLnete.<br />\nGross Incompatability<br />\nTo my way of thinking there are four essential<br />\n?sons for this gross incompatibility of artist and a<br />\nuniversity milieu. The first is that all great creative art<br />\nrPrings from intrinsic pressures, from forces internally<br />\n!tierated by the artist, e.g. Schubert wrote because he<br />\nnad to, he couldn't help it. Universities, contrarily,<br />\n\u00b0Perate on the basis of extrinsic, outwardly imposed<br />\nrequirements and pressures: schedules, lectures, credits,<br />\nreados, assignments. There is absolutely no compatibility<br />\ntween the two methods of structuring behavior.<br />\nft The second reason is that any artist is by nature a<br />\n.e\u00b0 agent, following no rules except those necessary to<br />\n!sure his minimal existence in a hostile society, and<br />\n1\u00b0se of his art. Being an artist\u2014in direct contrast to<br />\nZYing the chattering aesthete\u2014entails a miserable life of<br />\n'eat<br />\nre<br />\nand sacrifice. I wonder how many people here<br />\ntoailize<br />\nl that fact in their bones, or have any idea of the<br />\n,the frustration, the bitterness, and the tenacity that<br />\ne both required and engendered by such genuine,<br />\nr<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nascetic grappling. Being a member of a university<br />\ncommunity, whether student, professor. researcher, or<br />\nbattener on others, has but little to do with<br />\nself-abnegation and especially with working in a clearly<br />\ndefined medium. The two ways of living, as well as their<br />\nproducts, simply don't intersect.<br />\nNo Rational Sense<br />\nThirdly, the essential functions of a student in a<br />\nuniversity and that of an artist are totally at varience. A<br />\nuniversity exists to discover and perhaps to disseminate<br />\ntruth. The function of an artist is. bluntly, to make a lie,<br />\nto fib, to confabulate, to put in place what didn't exist<br />\nbefore, to collate and arrange the abstract materials he<br />\nuses into meaningful and persuasive patterns. Sonority<br />\nwithout rational sense, for instance, is anathema to<br />\nacademically impacted persons, but Mallarme and<br />\nSwinburne did all right by its dictates.<br />\nFinally, just look at the difference in life-styles<br />\nbetween the typical (but not, fortunately, universally<br />\ntypical) \"successful\" student and an artist. Those who<br />\nhave succumbed to school's extrinsic pressures have had<br />\ntheir spirits burned away, they have lost all their wits<br />\nand are robots. And the adults have become puerile and<br />\nstand for nothing in particular. Artists have got to keep<br />\ntheir wits about them, have got to keep open the lines of<br />\npermutation and possibility, to conserve and nurture a<br />\nmeasure of eclat and elan, which are in any case but the<br />\nnatural, functional psycho-motoric correllaries of flair<br />\nand talent rigorously pursued.<br />\nWhat we presently have at universities that purport<br />\nto foster the creative arts, and what is the best we can<br />\nhope to have, even at meccas like Harvard or Berkeley<br />\n(\"which have EVERYTHING\"), is one of two things:<br />\neither the dry husks and shells of the past centuries' art<br />\nand culture, carefully fondled and swaddled by<br />\nself-appointed curators(as if art had to be mummified to<br />\nsurvive!), or an anarchic pastiche of slabs and dabs at<br />\ntechniques, lacquered over with jejune enthusiasm and a<br />\ndeep contempt for tradition. The rare dissenter, like<br />\nBrustein at Yale, who thinks too much freedom<br />\ncollapses itself, is swamped.<br />\nImmense amounts of money are lavished on<br />\nrecords, concerts, galleries, studios, and ateliers. But<br />\nsomehow, terribly, most of the effort seems to come<br /><br />\ndown to mere self-indulgence, as in finger-painting, while<br />\nactivists, naturally, think all art is cant.<br />\nArtistic creation, whose beginnings were detected<br />\nby Freud in the infant's pride over his bowel<br />\nmovements, now has\u2014especially at university<br />\nconservatories and their attendant culture warehouses<br />\nand merchandise barns, in paintings, sculpture, and '<br />\naleatory noise\u2014its ultimate manifestation in creations<br />\nwhose contents betray a similar pride and a similar<br />\ndegree of autonomy\u2014and a similar product.<br />\nBuy A Bordello<br />\nI would beg Johns I lopkins to leave Culture with a<br />\ncapital C, meaning the greatness of Mankind, alone.<br />\nUniversity funds might better be spent on a hundred<br />\nthings: a bordello for interested students and faculty, a<br />\nhigh-rise parking garage. buying off the roving gangs of<br />\npetty thugs who destroy so much campus flora and<br />\nproperty, etc. The basic truth is that one cannot teach<br />\nVirgil, Dante. Newton, Mozart, and Rembrandt without<br />\nkilling them. Anyone who cares about these or related<br />\naspects of the human condition and finds them<br />\n\"relevant\" will, by the time he gets to a university, have<br />\nbeen actively exploring them, by himself, for years on<br />\nend. If he wants technical training, he'll go to a master<br />\nor expert\u2014you don't cage the maestro for the convenient<br />\naccess of tyros and callow collegians. If he needs the<br />\ncompany of others similarly engaged, he'll find it by<br />\nfollowing his nose.<br />\nAs for those considerably rarer birds, the true<br />\nartists, why, they need in fact not much more than air,<br />\nsilence, their artistic materials and the generosity of a<br />\nfew friends, to stay alive and do what they have to.(But,<br />\nsad thought, there is nowhere accessible they can find<br />\nthe first two, the cash nexus and inflation increasingly<br />\ncrimp the third, and who today is capable of such<br />\nfriendship?) Art is, happily, far too difficult and arcane a<br />\nhuman pursuit ever to be amenable to the machinations<br />\nof the school monks: let us hope that it is also far too<br />\nresiliant, and its apprentices too obdurately pugnacious<br />\nand hughty-deluded, ever to be led down the garden<br />\npath by a university's well-meaning but disastrous<br />\naffections.<br /><br />\nGood Massa, Bad Massa, Bad Acting, Bad Movie<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nSoon Baltimore will see its second motion picture<br />\nPremier of the year, the first being Andy Warhol's<br />\nlirnitation of Christ.

One of the three writers is black, and two of the<br />\nculree stars are black. Herbert Biberman, the director and<br />\nb\u00b0<br />\neauthor, is passionately convinced that black is<br />\nautiful. He is fascinated by black skin for itself, and<br />\nqt,1\u00b0ws his cameras to linger for an embarrassingly long<br />\nulle on the shining faces of slaves young and old, to the<br />\nti t where we have a color photographic album of<br />\n2.111inn vignettes in the South. (\"Through the Bayous<br />\n\"ith Gun and Camera.\")<br />\nInterspersed between these snapshots is a weak<br />\n\u00b01Y, suitable for television, about slavery in the South<br />\n\u2022 1850. The Good Master in Kentucky, heavily in debt<br />\n\u00b0. the greasy Slave Trader, is forced to sell two of his<br />\nPrline darkies down the river.

We<br />\nhave the whole legendary scene of the antebellum South.<br />\nThere is the kind Good Master, who in a crisis acts like<br />\nany other white slave owner.

The cops did it for me. I saw this cop<br />\nZiPping out a aerosol can, and my mind flashed<br />\nZtantly- MACE! But instead of running away<br />\nounediately like any normal person, I paused a fraction<br />\na second to see what it looked like. Then I ran away<br />\nbugrriedly, my hands covering my head. The stinging and<br />\nse Nog suddenly hit my eyes and I found myself<br />\noirLeaming like a madman. But inwardly, and I'm sure<br />\nth\"'ers felt this way, too, I was glad. I was baptized into<br />\n;tee revolution. I had been.... brutalized. At last, after<br />\nnears of yearning for a confrontation, only a viewer,<br />\ner a participant, I had, at last, been attacked. I had<br />\n;<br />\nc4tched the convention brutalities on T.V. and<br />\nkr!anied in horror when the cops beat up those kids. I<br />\n\u2022 read the articles on the Columbia police riot with<br />\nIrtnated horror, relishing each tidbit of police violence.<br />\n\u00b0W, I toa had been attacked.<br />\nih With a crazy mixture of pain and .ecstasy I ran to<br />\nrpY dorm to wash my eyes out. It really hurt, and I was<br />\n\"Rddened with the burning of my eyes. I was secretly<br />\nh.ad that there were some kids in the dorm near the<br />\nwaterfountain to watch me suffer. They gave me advice<br />\nl screamed in hoarse confusion. Yet, even with all this<br />\nf,ain, I was inwardly pleased at the expressions on their<br />\ntKe..es. They had the same shocked look on their faces<br />\n\"t I had when I saw others being beaten on T.V. I was<br /><br />\ntheir Chicago.<br />\nUpstairs, my joy at being maced became rather less<br />\nsecret. As I stood over the sink dunking my head in the<br />\nwater, I turned to the kid next to me and said, \"Well, at<br />\nleast you've been radicalized.\" In a rather startling<br />\nincident, I heard kids screaming about tear gas, and<br />\nwhen I picked up my head, I saw white smoke coming<br />\nthrough the bathroom windows. I almost collapsed from<br />\nfright until I realized that it was steam from the showers.<br />\nAfter dunking my head a few more times, I rushed to<br />\nmy room grabbed my army jacket (A Must for Campus<br />\nRebels!) and ran out to sec the riot I hoped would be<br />\nforthcoming.<br />\nI ran out proudly, my disheveled, sopping wet<br />\nappearance proof of my Battle with the Pigs. My eyes<br />\nstill stung to remind me of it. What greeted me,<br />\nhowever, was not an angry mob, but surprisingly listless<br />\nstudents milling about. I ranted at the crowd angrily for<br />\ntheir placidness in the face of this shocking assault. In a<br />\nhoarse voice, I hollered,\"What do they have to do, man?<br />\nKill us or something? On to Gordon's!\" Unfortunately,<br />\nthe crowd was not instantly mesmerized by this<br />\nfascinating display of eloquence, and I had to wait<br />\naround a few minutes until I could find some friends<br />\nwho were willing to walk over to Gordon's house with<br />\nme.<br />\nSuch is the lot of a revolutionary.<br /><br />\nDilsey-like life attitudes. There is the patient<br />\never-suffering Bible quoting black Baptist, but mercifully<br />\nno banjo-strumming Bojangles or tap dancing. For<br />\nscenery we have the Big White llouse On The Hill, and<br />\nof course, The Swamp.<br />\nThe character played by Stephen Boyd combines<br />\n\u2022<br />\ntwo other well-known Southern stock figures, the<br />\nvicious heartless Bad Massa and the empty Alcoholic.<br />\nHowever, Mr. Boyd's acting abilities are highly<br />\ndebatable, and he has great difficulty convincing his<br />\naudience that he is that evil. No one despises the<br />\nPhantom of the Opera any more; we laugh at his<br />\nexaggerated melodrama.<br />\nDionne Warwick, wearing the latest 1969 Afro<br />\nfashions (this is 1850, remember), makes her screen<br />\ndebut as the alcoholic mistress of the Bad Massa, a role<br />\nwith probably very little historical precendent. Her<br />\namateurish performance is even more lifeless and<br />\nunconvincing than Mr. Boyd's. Ossic Davis, as the black<br />\nwho sees the light and decides to \"haul ass for freedom\",<br />\nis the only realistic actor in a forest of wooden statues.<br />\nHe is murdered at the end, undoubtedly for being the<br />\nonly talented one in the whole movie. Davis is the only<br />\nactor who tries to expand upon and develop his stock<br />\nrole.<br />\nSlaves has a definite message, and perhaps for that<br />\nreason we can overlook the stereotyped characters and<br />\nsetting. Those things did exist, they were common;<br />\notherwise, they would not have become stereotypes.<br />\nHopefully, a film based on common scenes and<br />\nwell-known character types will try to find new meaning<br />\nin those archetypes, or at least broaden one's viewpoint<br />\non related issues. Biberman fails to do that in Slaves.<br />\nSlavery Is Bad<br />\nThe moral of the film: slavery is bad, human<br />\nbeings shouldn't own other human beings. Great for<br />\n1850. But not 1969. The film, according to Biberman, is<br />\ntrying to \"tell it like it was,\" with the intention of also<br />\nbeing relevant to contemporary race problems. Not too<br />\nmany people are going to dispute that slavery is bad and<br />\nfreedom is good. But there does seem to be some<br />\ndisagreement, among people of all races, about present<br />\nracial conflicts. Slaves, despite its claims, is in no way<br />\nrelevant to that. Telling it like it was can only interest<br />\npeople who find enjoyment in the videoland of Matt<br />\nDillons and Cartwright families.<br />\nSome value can be found in this film. The great<br />\nWhite Liberal Middle Class Guilt Complex will no doubt<br />\nbe deepened by scenes of brutality and injustice. And<br />\nhopefully more (and better) films of this type will be<br />\nmade, only in a contemporary milieu.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 2,..19<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 10<br /><br />\nModel Cities Lags After Three Years<br />\nEditor's Note: This is the second in a three-part series of<br />\nanalyses of the Baltimore poverty program. Next week:<br />\nThe Community Action Agency.<br />\nBy HEY WOOD SANDERS<br />\nSpecial to the News-Letter<br />\nThe national Model Cities program was<br />\npresented to the Congress in 1966 with much.<br />\nfanfare, and with many high expectations. Now,<br />\nin 1969, it looks as if many of the expectations<br />\nwill remain unfulfilled, and that the programs.<br />\nwill bring nothing to the over-policed and<br />\nunder-developed Inner City of Baltimore.<br />\nIn introducing the program, former President<br />\nJohnson said that it was \"To build not just housing units<br />\nbut neighborhoods; not just to construct schools, but to<br />\neducate children; not just to raise income, but to create<br />\nbeauty and end the poisoning of our environment.\"<br />\nWith these goals, Model Cities were developed to<br />\nprovide funds for new and innovative projects and<br />\ncomprehensive planning. These projects were to be<br />\nFunded with special Federal grants of up to 80 percent<br />\nof the cost. All programs were required to be<br />\ncomprehensive, concentrated, and to have substantial<br />\nimpact on the Model neighborhoods.<br />\nMaximum Impact<br />\nUnfortunately, the program is only to last five<br />\nyears, and projects which are self- sustaining at the end<br />\nof that period will be out of both money and support.<br />\nAs a result, the Model Cities program must be developed<br />\nwith an eye to gaining the maximum impact and benefit<br />\nas soon as possible. Needed citizen backing will only<br />\ncome after the relevance and the meaning of the<br />\nprogram is demonstrated, and unless services are<br />\ndelivered rapidly, this program will go the way of many<br />\nPrevious ones.<br />\nBaltimore's program was developed with nine<br />\nspecific goals in mind: adequate income, a decent<br />\nstandard of health, a decent home in a suitable<br />\nenvironment, a quality education, stability of family,<br />\nopportunities for use of leisure time, a more highly<br />\ndeveloped internal economy, and individual and<br /><br />\ncommunity self-sufficiency.<br />\nThe actual achievement of these goals will depend<br />\non the success of the 36 proposed programs submitted<br />\nto the national Department of Housing and Urban<br />\nDevelopment, and the Baltimore City Council. The<br />\nprogram will cost between $10 and 12 million in Model<br />\nCities funds alone in the first year. The largest part of<br />\n/<br />\n2 million, will be for<br />\nthe expenditure, close to $31<br />\nhousing programs.<br />\nThe proposed distribution of funds represents one<br />\nof the major initial failings of the program. More money<br />\nis being poured into housing programs which can create<br />\npleasant looking neighborhoods, but which fail to do<br />\nanything to end poverty and the cycle of failure in<br />\nAmerican ghettoes.<br />\nSince the Housing Act of 1949, which began the<br />\nNational Program of Public Housing, far too much of<br />\nlimited resources have been earmarked to build buildings<br />\nrather than people.<br />\nThis expenditure for housing will be reflected in<br />\nthe priority given projects in the first year, and could<br />\nlead to an even greater emphasis on the environmental<br />\ngoal than the amount indicates.<br />\nMoney to Professionals<br />\nIn spite of the large degree of neighborhood<br />\ninvolvement and control in the project, much of the<br />\npersonnel money will be going to professionals. The<br />\nModel Cities program will employ 316 professionals, 67<br />\nclerical workers, and 340 neighborhood people. Thus,<br />\nmuch of the first year funds will be going to well paid<br />\npeople who have often worked previously for city<br />\nagencies.<br />\nThe large number of professional positions is<br />\nreflected in the unfortunate top-heaviness in the total<br />\norganization. In addition, each of the individual.<br />\nprograms will require a separate staff and director,<br />\nincreasing the number of chiefs in the Agency.<br />\nAlthough the programs generally represent an<br />\nimaginative and innovative approach, their number,<br />\ndispersion, and limited coverage guarantee limited<br />\nsuccess at best.<br />\nIn the field of Manpower, the Agency has<br />\nproposed four programs. The first of these is a program<br />\nto train under-employed young people, with 300<br /><br />\ntrainees in the first year. Two other programs will settIP<br />\ncorporations, one for custodial maintenance and anot116<br />\nfor homemakers, to be owned and operated by ti\",<br />\nneighborhood. These programs will employ a total 01<br />\neighty individuals. While they represent interesting i&amp;Js<br />\nthey will make scant impact on an area with over 5,v<br />\nunemployed workers.<br />\nIn addition, the Manpower proposal calls for l,,%1<br />\nexperimental income supplement plan, providing a<br />\nmoney and services to two groups of 150 fa milies<br />\n!<br />\nThis represents about one percent of the Well<br />\npopulation of the Model neighborhood. Thus, it isi.;<br />\nexperiment in social welfare that can only prove vi',.<br />\nwe already know\u2014that welfare payments are inadalt12:\u201e<br />\nThe Manpower program will do very little to\",<br />\nthe problems of inner-city poverty.

Little change<br />\nCould be foreseen by Clements, either in<br />\nAmerica or in the Church.<br />\n\"The Roman Catholic Church is<br />\nno different than any other white<br />\norganization; it always has been and<br />\ngives every indication that it will<br />\nContinue to be,\" the Catholic Priest<br />\nClaimed. Further, the Catholic Church<br />\nhas continually addressed itself to White<br /><br />\nSociety, and is a definite part of that<br />\nsociety, he claimed.<br />\nIll Prepared<br />\nFather Clements felt that<br />\nCatholicism is \"ill-prepared\" to fulfill<br />\nits role in the Black Community. It is<br />\nnot cognizant of the changing needs in<br />\nthe Negro community.<br />\nSpeaking of the problems of<br />\nNegro Priests in general, Father<br />\nClements pointed out \"We are Black<br />\nfirst, we are born Black, and it is only<br />\nlater, after a period of time, that we<br />\nbecome Catholic priests.\" He suggested<br />\nthat Black priests may.eventually utilize<br />\nseparation as a technique to achieve<br />\nsome relevance \"to their Church and<br />\ntheir People.\"<br />\nHe deplored the lack of Black<br />\npriests in any decison-making position<br />\nin the entire U0ed States. Citing the<br />\nrecent Black Caucus, Clements pointed<br /><br />\nout that not one priest there could ever<br />\nremember being called in for<br />\nconsultation by their bishop.

Only pressure<br />\nfrom the Black community prevented<br />\nthis appointment, and forced the bishop<br />\nto appoint a Black pastor. Clements<br />\nhimself was transferred from the parish,<br />\nand has been promised a pastorship in<br />\nsome Black community in the near<br />\nfuture.<br />\nFather Clements had certain<br />\nconcrete suggestions for the<br /><br />\nimprovement of the church. Lie was not<br />\noptimistic over the fate of his<br />\nsuggestions, however, explaining that<br />\nthey will be implemented, \"Only if the<br />\nwhite man wants them.\"<br />\nHe suggested a general<br />\nre-evaluation of attitudes toward Black<br />\nmilitants, both within and outside the'<br />\nchurch. He further urged more effective<br />\nutilization of Black priests, especially in<br />\ndecision-making positions.

The<br />\ndecision was formally announced<br />\nMonday.<br />\nOn a broad level, this decision has<br />\nseveral effects which are damaging to<br />\nstudents in general. It removes 90% of<br />\nopportunity for those interested in<br />\nindividual sports. It removes all<br />\nopportunity for those who are not<br />\ninterested in the so-called \"major\"<br />\nsports (i.e., Lacrosse, Football,<br />\nBasketball, Soccer, Swimming,<br />\nWrestling, and Baseball). It removes all<br />\nopportunity for those who are not good<br />\nenough in \"major- sports to earn a<br />\nVarsity Letter. And it removes all<br />\nopportunity for those interested in<br />\nlearning a new sport in college. It is,<br /><br />\ntherefore, a decision which is unfair to<br />\nthe majority of undergraduates.<br />\nWith regard to fencing alone, this<br />\ndecision is nothing short of tragic. It<br />\nmakes absolutely meaningless the aches,<br />\npains, sweat, and hard work which all of<br />\nus have put in, especially for freshmen,<br />\nsophmores and juniors. It invalidates the<br />\nmany sacrifices - over and above the call<br />\nof studies which all of us have made. It<br />\ndestroys the twenty year tradition of<br />\nexcellence which has made fencing one<br />\nof the (only) two consistently winning<br />\nteams at Hopkins. It completely wipes<br />\naway the intense pride which has been<br />\nfor the past twelve years. Worst of all, it<br />\nleaves the University without fencing which is a tragedy.<br />\nSo we have never placed lower<br />\nthan third in an 8-team conference? So<br />\nwe had the only men ever to win a<br />\ncon ference championship in two<br />\nweapons (Tom Ahern, MAC,<br />\nEpee-1962, Foil-1963), .and to win a<br /><br />\nchampionship in two conferences (Jerry<br />\nLam, MAC and NAC, 1966)? So we had<br />\nmore guys on our varsity and freshman<br />\ncombined roster (average 35)each year;<br />\nmore than Baseball, Tennis,<br />\nCross-Country, Track, Golf, and<br />\nWrestling? So, since 1952, there have<br />\nbeen only three years in which we have<br />\nnot won at least one team and one<br />\nindividual championship?<br />\nIf you believe that Athletics at<br />\nHopkins is to serve the students, then<br />\nsign the petition that is being circulated<br />\nin the dorms.<br />\nVance Tiede<br />\nCaptain JHU Fencing<br />\nTeam 1968-'69<br />\nPOOR JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nPerhaps the most exciting event to<br />\nhappen in the last few days was the<br />\nappearance of Lincoln Gordon at the<br />\nmeeting of the student body on Friday.<br /><br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at:<br /><br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest italian food in town<br /><br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br /><br />\nOf course it meant the arrest of three<br />\nmembers of that body on various drug<br />\ncharges, but what a small price to pay<br />\nfor the appearance of our leader.

The issue I am referring to is<br />\nthe University's decision (Gordon and his Administrators',<br />\nnot the Athletic Department's) to drop five sports from<br />\nnext year's intercollegiate schedule. These sports are<br />\nTrack, Cross-Country, Tennis, Golf, and Fencing.<br />\nAlthough the overall budget has been increased from $200,000<br />\nto $245,000, the abolition of these sports by Dr. Gordon and the<br />\nhigher-ups in his Administration hierarchy is deplorable, and it must<br />\nbe appealed through proper channels. The total savings of this<br />\narbitrary economy move is a small $14,240 (this figure does not<br />\ninclude necessary equipment replacement).<br />\nThe move, which effects over 25% of all those Hopkins<br />\nathletes participating in intercollegiates, came as a surprise to all<br />\nexcept those responsible for making the decision, which had been<br />\nshrouded in secrecy since its formulation a week ago last Monday,<br />\nand its eventual seepage to individuals on last Monday. It is hard,<br />\ngiven the evasive nature of Bilgrave's statements, to pin to blame on<br />\nany one Administrator, but the buck stops with our fearless and<br />\nuntil recently innocuous President, Lincoln \"Shylock\" Gordon. He<br />\nhas to assume full blame for this ill-advised economy move.<br />\nFurther Tragedy<br />\nIt is further tragic that none of the student-athletes or<br />\npart-time coaches were consulted before this decision was made. In<br />\nfact the Athletic Committee's recommendations from last semester<br />\nwere ignored except for the principle that if a cutback had to be<br />\nmade it should come in the intercollegiate area. The point is a cut<br />\nshould not come. Cloaked in secrecy, the decision came as a<br />\ncomplete surprise to Paul Allen and Dennis Estis - the two students<br />\non the Committee of Physical Education. It is obvious now that this<br />\nCommittee was disbanded too soon as most of their<br />\nrecommendations have gone unheard in the offices of the<br />\nAdministration's Elite.<br />\nI argue that an assertive drive by the Alumni Office and the<br />\nother possible fund-raising bodies of the University could have<br />\nscared up the comparatively small sum of money needed to finance<br />\nthese five sports. In Mr. Bilgrave's words, \"money is tight.\" In our<br />\nwords, the University is even tighter. We aren't asking for miracles,<br />\nbut we are asking the university to at least try to raise the money.<br />\nHow many of you readers knew that there was a possibility of these<br />\nsports being dropped?<br />\nThis is symptomatic of a larger question: up to now, student<br />\ninvolvement in University decision-making has been more tokenism<br />\nthan reality. Why weren't students notified through proper channels<br />\nrather than having to find out through the grapevine? What kind of a<br />\nUniversity are you running, Dr. Gordon? This is not the State<br />\nDepartment. You can make your identity known instead of hiding<br />\nbehind the topcoats of your Administrators.<br />\nThe University has not begun to exhaust all possibilities for<br />\nraising the money. The cutting of the Athletic Budget does not even<br />\nbegin to solve the problem for, according to Bilgrave, other<br />\nintercollegiate sports might have to be abandoned in the future.<br />\nLet's stop this trend now and reverse the tide, if possible. Track,<br />\ncross-country, golf, tennis, and fencing must be brought back.<br />\nThe Student Council has set up a Committee with Gus<br />\nSlotman as Chairman to open a dialogue with the Administration.<br />\nWe hope that talks do not get bogged down in Committee but that<br />\nsome positive action, such as reinstatement of these sports without<br />\njeopardy to the rest of the budget requests, be taken. Given the<br />\nfacts, what would the Alumni think if on Homecoming the Varsity<br />\nLacrosse team refused to play Navy? Of course, being rational<br />\npeople, we do not favor such an action, but something must be<br />\ndone. The only solution which we endorse is full reinstatement of<br />\nthese sports in the intercollegiate program.<br />\nI have my own ideas as to how the money should be raised.<br />\nShort and long range financial responsibility lies with the University.<br />\nYou can bleed the students just so much (i.e. increases in tuition,<br />\nactivity fees, reduction in scholarships) before they will rebel. That<br />\nline of distinction is drawing close.<br />\nThe ideal situation would be an endowment fund for the<br />\nAthletic Department. If the Admissions charge passes, the money<br />\ntaken in from gate receipts should go to an Athletic Endowment<br />\nFund rather than into the University's general kitty. Meanwhile, Dr.<br />\nGordon should direct the Alumni Office to raise money for this fund<br />\nwhile still directing the University to shoulder full financial<br />\nresponsibility for a FULL Athletic Budget (none of this marginal<br />\ngarbage) which would include these five sports. Come on, Dr.<br />\n!Gordon, quit being stingy. If you can't find the $14,240 why don't<br />\nOu're\u00a7igh.and let the BbardbfTrastees find someone who can?<br /><br />\n0 ril<br />\n4<br />\n444<br /><br />\n\u00b0<br /><br />\n,, \u2022 ,111<br />\nRAP,<br /><br />\nby<br /><br />\n41\u2018 m74;<br /><br />\nHONORABLE MENTION ALL AMERICAN Charlie \"C.C.\" Coker fends off Army sticker. \"C.C.\" rifled 6 goals int<br />\nthe Army nets.

Earlier on<br />\nMonday, 100 Harvard and Radcliffe students marched<br />\nfrom the middle of I larvard Yard to the Radcliffe's<br />\nadministration building and invaded the office of Dr.<br />\nMary Bunting, Radcliffe's president, to protest in a<br />\nnoisy, ten minute session the disciplining of 12 Radcliffe<br />\ngirls who participated in a sit-in last December.

No one gives a damn if you've taken soul<br />\ncourses. They want to know if you can do mathematics<br />\nand write a correct sentence.\"<br />\nThe civil rights leader pleaded for rcmcmdial<br />\ncourses for black students, asserting that colleges \"must<br />\nnot give them a piece of paper (a diploma) until they are<br />\nbrought up to par.\" Speaking to the American Jewish<br />\nCommittee in New York City, Rustin said, \"The easy<br />\nway out is to let them have black courses and their own<br />\ndormitories and give them degrees.\"<br />\nRefering to the recent building takeover at Cornell<br />\nby black, gun-hearing students, Rustin stated, \"A<br />\nmultiple society cannot exist where an clement in that<br />\nsociety out of its own sense of masochism, permits<br />\nanother segment of that society to hold guns at their<br />\nheads in the name of justice.-<br /><br />\nGoucherBlackStudies<br />\nGoucher College has yielded to pressure from its<br />\nfourteen black students and plans to offer six Black<br />\nStudies courses during the 1969-1970 academic year,<br />\naccording to outgoing Black Student Association<br />\nPresident Peggy Brooks.<br />\nThe courses will be aimed at giving both white and<br />\nblack students at the college'-aii \"opportunity to learn<br />\nmore about the black man in America.\" \"It will be an<br />\ninterdisciplinary type of effort.\" Miss Brooks said, aimed<br />\nat \"heeling up\" academic areas in which the role of the<br />\nblack man has been \"ignored either intentionally or<br />\nunintentionally in the past.\"<br />\nMiss Rhoda M.

There is too much emphasis on the<br />\nmaterialistic side of life among the nation's youth, the<br />\nPresident suggested.<br />\nThe White House staff is currently considering a<br />\ntelevision network's request to broadcast one of the<br />\nservices. At last Sunday's congregation, the President<br />\njoined in singing the Doxology, \"Praise God, From<br />\nWhom All Blessing Flow.\" Before and after the sermon,<br />\nthere were two other hymns, \"Holy, Holy, Holy\" and<br />\n\"God of Grace and God of Glory.\" A solo,\"The Lord Is<br />\nMy Light,\" was sung by Robert Nicholson of the Wesley<br />\nUnited Methodist Church in Washington.<br /><br />\nMarine Maltreatment<br />\nBrutality and other maltreatments are so ingrained<br />\nin the Marine Corps that the corps \"may serve as a<br />\nlaboratory for the study of institutionalized violence,\" a<br />\npsychologist has charged in a paper delivered to the<br />\nAmerican Orthopsychiatric Association Convention this<br />\nweek in New York.<br />\nPhysical maltreatment of recruits is a normal part<br />\nof a severe Marinb initiation rite and is subtly condoned,<br />\nalthough officially prohibited, by the corp, said<br />\npsychologist Waldo B.

But does the end justify the means?<br />\nMust we rely on a brutal, anachronistic organization to<br />\ngive the youth that vital feeling of competence and<br />\nmaturity?\"<br />\nAlthough maltreatment by drill instructors has<br />\nbeen under-reported, Lyons stated that \"over a<br />\n27-month period from 1964 to 1966, 120 drill<br />\ninstructors were relieved from duty at Parris Island for a<br />\nvariety of reasons, including 73 for 'assault,'<br />\n'maltreatment,' or 'maltreatment risk.\"<br /><br />\nLarrabee Inducted<br />\nThe National Academy of Sciences, the most<br />\nprestigious honorary scientific organization in the<br />\ncountry, announced the election of Hopkins' Martin G.<br />\nLarrabee to its ranks on Tuesday.<br />\nDr. Larrabee, professor of biophysics, was one of<br />\nfifty scientists inducted into the 846-man organization<br />\nthis year.<br />\nThe Hopkins professor's work has centered on the<br />\nmetabolism of nerve cells and metabolic studies of<br />\nsympathetic ganglia.

He said that the<br />\nJewish environment makes for maximum use of talent.<br />\nHowever, he was convinced that the environmental<br />\nfactors could not explain the phenomenon entirely.<br />\nIf the success of the Jews could be explained only<br />\nby the fact that they are forced to work harder, starting<br />\n\"with two strikes against them\", said Lord Snow, one<br />\nwould expect their level of achievement to drop when<br />\nthey entered an unoppressive society such as America's.<br />\n\"Will that happen?\" he asked. \"Or is there<br />\nsomething in the Jewish gene-pool which produces talent<br />\non quite a different scale from, say, the Anglo-Saxon<br />\ngene-pool? I am prepared to believe that may be so.\"<br />\nWhen asked for evidence of the Jews' superiority,<br />\neven in terms of achievement, Lord Snow stated,\"Well,<br />\ntake any test of achievement you like-in any branch of<br />\nscience, mathematics, literature, music, public life. The<br />\nJewish performance has been not only disproportionate,<br />\nbut ridiculously disproportionate.\" He added,\"To use a<br />\ncrude criterion, run your eye down the lists of Nobel<br />\nPrize Winners for the last 25 years.
