Beach<br />\nThe corrent controversy between left-wing and<br />\nright-wing literary critics has not always Men too<br />\nclear. Objectivity and keen sanity have not always<br />\nprevailed on both sides. But the assault of the \"proletarian\" critics and writers has done much to clear a<br />\nhazy atmosphere and renew. the vitality of both the<br />\nmanner and content of literary criticism. The flaccid<br />\nsentimentalists like William Lyons Phelps, Isabel Patterson, and Herschel Brickell, have shown their true<br />\ncolors by retreating behind a cloud of pointless slander,<br />\nbut the more intelligent of the critics, Krutch and Cowley, for example, have taken up the challenge sincerely<br />\nand objectively. The result has been a purer literary<br />\natmosphere, -more conducive to creative effort and the<br />\nclarity of literary criteria.<br />\nPut broadly and most reasonably, the chief claim<br />\nof the left-wing critics is that'literary productions tse<br />\njudged by the degree of understanding of social forces<br />\ndisplayed therein. Sound technique and convincing reality of character are not however dispensed with as<br />\nbourgeois superfluities. On the contrary, the radicalminded critics contend that the broad comprehension by<br />\nan author of the lines of development of his own times<br />\ngives more vital and organic meaning to his technique<br />\nand delineation of character; that an understanding of<br />\nthe dynamics of social change Makes possible a fuller<br />\nand clearer conception of individual character and a<br />\nsounder development of the chosen theme; that, in fine,<br />\nthese three ingredients of good literature are so vitally<br />\nconnected that -the absence of one results inevitably in<br />\nthe weakening of the others.<br />\nThe question of propaganda. in art is beside the<br />\npoint. A really great novel, according to the abovementioned criteria, cannot but be good propaganda. It<br />\ndrives home mercilessly the necessity of the next step<br />\nin the scale of social progress.

Beach<br />\nThe corrent controversy between left-wing and<br />\nright-wing literary critics has not always Men too<br />\nclear. Objectivity and keen sanity have not always<br />\nprevailed on both sides. But the assault of the \"proletarian\" critics and writers has done much to clear a<br />\nhazy atmosphere and renew. the vitality of both the<br />\nmanner and content of literary criticism. The flaccid<br />\nsentimentalists like William Lyons Phelps, Isabel Patterson, and Herschel Brickell, have shown their true<br />\ncolors by retreating behind a cloud of pointless slander,<br />\nbut the more intelligent of the critics, Krutch and Cowley, for example, have taken up the challenge sincerely<br />\nand objectively. The result has been a purer literary<br />\natmosphere, -more conducive to creative effort and the<br />\nclarity of literary criteria.<br />\nPut broadly and most reasonably, the chief claim<br />\nof the left-wing critics is that'literary productions tse<br />\njudged by the degree of understanding of social forces<br />\ndisplayed therein. Sound technique and convincing reality of character are not however dispensed with as<br />\nbourgeois superfluities. On the contrary, the radicalminded critics contend that the broad comprehension by<br />\nan author of the lines of development of his own times<br />\ngives more vital and organic meaning to his technique<br />\nand delineation of character; that an understanding of<br />\nthe dynamics of social change Makes possible a fuller<br />\nand clearer conception of individual character and a<br />\nsounder development of the chosen theme; that, in fine,<br />\nthese three ingredients of good literature are so vitally<br />\nconnected that -the absence of one results inevitably in<br />\nthe weakening of the others.<br />\nThe question of propaganda. in art is beside the<br />\npoint. A really great novel, according to the abovementioned criteria, cannot but be good propaganda. It<br />\ndrives home mercilessly the necessity of the next step<br />\nin the scale of social progress.
