Unfortunately, the referendum on the<br />\nHonor Code could be entirely meaningless, since the proposals,<br />\nif they are approved by the students, will go to a by-laws<br />\ncommittee, which will then do the actual writing of new rules<br />\nfor the Honor Commission.<br />\nThe by-laws committee will have as its only official student<br />\ninput the SC's somewhat vague\"substantive recommendations,\"<br />\nwhich appeared in undergraduate mailboxes yesterday. The<br />\ncommittee would be in no way bound by any of the<br />\nrecommendations and could thus modify, adjust or even ignore<br />\nthem. The votes Of undergraduates would then become totally<br />\nmeaningless.<br />\nIf this issue were not so serious, if it did not go to the very<br />\nheart of what a university education stands for, then the<br />\nStudent Council's sloppy action on the honor code report<br />\nwould be nothing more than another typical student political<br />\nfarce. But the Honor Code matter is a crucial one, and the<br />\nCouncil's ill-considered plan to deal with the report is one of<br />\nthe most egregious mistakes made here in memory.<br />\nThe only sensible course for the SC is to withdraw its<br />\nrecommendations, draft a comprehensive Honor Code,<br />\nembodying the recommendations in the current report and<br />\nsubmit that proposed Code to a binding student referendum.<br />\nAny other action would only justify undergraduates' long-felt<br />\ncontempt for the Council.<br />\n<br />\nThe popular politics of capital punishment<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\n\"I like the sound of it,\"<br />\nremarked Nelson Rockefeller in<br />\nreference to President Nixon's<br />\nSaturday afternoon special on law<br />\nand order.

Sometimes we'll<br />\nscream about tuition increases, or<br />\nthe sheer incompetence of graduate student TA's in History, English and Math; or even about the<br />\nridiculous committees George Benton sets up to amuse himself on<br />\nthose rare days he spends on campus.<br />\nBut on the whole, the NewsLetter is about as informative as<br />\nthe back of a raisin bran box.<br />\nSo much for the factual content.<br />\nOur editorials are often not much<br />\nbetter. When they have the facts<br />\nstraight, they range from otiose to<br />\ninsipid._<br />\nThus runs the traditional philosophy. It has probably never occured to you, however, that all this<br />\n<br />\nbumbling, seemingly-incompetent<br />\noutput is in fact a ruse for the valuable Cabalistic information which<br />\ninheres in our pages, in the form of<br />\nacronyms, puzzles, and meaningful<br />\ntypographical errors.<br />\nFind that hard to believe? Try<br />\nthis:<br />\nThe News-Letter is ghost-written<br />\nby sentient beings from outer<br />\nspace who, like Provost Harry<br />\nWoolf, have \"difficulty speaking in<br />\nAnglo-Saxon thought units.\"<br />\nFar-fetched? Try this one:<br />\nNothing, absolutely nothing that<br />\ngoes on at this University is worth<br />\ntaking seriously. Here I believe is<br />\nto be found the germ of our journalistic attitude. A look at last FriPage One<br />\n<br />\nLead story - Gov. Mandel has<br />\nnot yet requested funding for his<br />\nexpanded aid to higher education<br />\nbill, announced at the Feb. 22<br />\nBirthday Party exercises during<br />\nwhich Mandel was awarded an<br />\nhonorary degree, which takes on<br />\nthe aspect of a quid pro quo. The<br />\nspeech, by the way, was drafted by<br />\nEllery Woodworth, a Muller<br />\nassistant in charge of Government<br />\nLiason, or lobbying.<br />\nAdministrators told us that it is<br />\nstandard operating procedure for<br />\n'host organizations to draft<br />\nspeeches for visiting dignitaries.<br />\nOkay, but why the suspense and<br />\nthe shrugging shoulders when the<br />\nquestion of expanded state aid was<br />\nmentioned?<br />\nSecond story - Employment<br />\nService underway. Ahem. George<br />\nBenton thought the idea of an<br />\nEmployment Service would be<br />\nworthwhile, in light of cutbacks in<br />\nfederal funding, and the $300 t4ition hike. His enthusiasm mounted<br />\nwhen it appeared that a black<br />\nwoman would accept the directorship of the Service, thus creating<br />\nthe impression that the University<br />\nis truly concerned with remedying<br />\nits disgustingly poor record of<br />\nminority and women hiring.<br />\nWhen the woman decided to<br />\ntake another job, everyone's interest waned. I personally applied for<br />\nthe directorship of the Employment Service, but Personnel Director J. Lyon Rogers, in an interview<br />\nabout as exciting as watching paint<br />\ndry, told me that the position had<br />\nbeen abolished. The whole business<br />\nwas being re-thought, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBy this time, John Riina, Director of Admissions and Financial<br />\nAid, his office already one full<br />\nmonth behind schedule in all its<br />\nactivities, had passed the Service<br />\nfrom his office, where it logically<br />\nbelongs, back to Benton. Benton,<br />\nin turn, passed the buck over to<br />\nthe Personnel Office.<br />\nFive weeks after the Service was<br />\nto have gotten underway, Benton<br />\nand Edward Warfield, in Personnel,<br />\ndecided to do something. Showing<br />\ngreat creativity, they decided to<br />\ntransfer hard-working Mary Bradshaw from Financial Aid to the<br />\nEmployment Service.

I only decided to<br />\nrun last Friday because I finally<br />\ndecided that the people who<br />\nwere running just did m.t give me<br />\na choice.<br />\nMindy Farber: I was goint to<br />\nsay the same thing ... I think the<br />\nStudent Council is now being<br />\nidentified with celebraties and<br />\ntherefore becoming more elitest<br />\nthan ever. Also, (what provoked<br />\nme to run was) that most of the<br />\nstudent body is not involved<br />\nwhatever, and I think that this is<br />\nsrong.<br />\nEric Rasmussen: Just the fact<br />\nthat I want to see the Council<br />\ncontinue in the fashion similar to<br />\nthe the fashion it had this year. It<br />\nstarted many things which can be<br />\ncarried on in the next Council.<br />\nFurthermore, I think that we can<br />\nexpound on the teacher<br />\nevaluation, for example. For the<br />\nmost part I. think that the<br />\nCouncil did a good job this year<br />\nand I want the good wI5rk to<br />\ncarry on.<br />\nAndy Savitz: (The question.<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nthat was asked Savitz was the<br />\nfollowing: Why did you<br />\ndeliberate to the degree that you<br />\ndid about running?) At first, no<br />\none would take me seriously<br />\nabout not running. But when<br />\nenough people talked to me<br />\nabout it, I was convinced to run<br />\nagain. What really pushed me<br />\nover the edge was talking with<br />\nmy parents, a few administrators<br />\nand with some of my friends.<br />\nThat's what took me so long.<br />\nQ.: How do you think you are<br />\nqualified? Barish: One of my<br />\nqualifications is that I have not<br />\nbeen involved in the Student<br />\nGovernment before. But, I have<br />\nbeen in High school activities and<br />\nI have administered organizations<br />\nbefore.<br />\nFarber: I think that my first<br />\nqualification is that I'm an<br />\nundergradUate student and I<br />\nthink that any undergraduate is<br />\nqualified to run. It's nonsense to<br />\nlist activities to dazzle everyone.<br />\nBut to ge,t down to my activities:<br />\nI'm spokeswomen for the<br />\nWomen's Center and I suppose<br />\nthat I've tried to work with the<br />\nwomen on this campus more<br />\nthan any Student Council<br />\nmember. Also, last year I was on<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies.<br />\n'Rasmussen: I've done most<br />\neverything else: I've been on the<br />\nStudent Council, I've been on the<br />\nOrientation Committee, and I've<br />\nbeen on the Student Council for<br />\ntwo years.<br />\nNews-Letter :1 think that we<br />\nknow your qualifications, Andy<br />\nQ.: What kind of<br />\nrepresentative would you be if<br />\nelected, a representative of the<br />\nentire student body Dr a special<br />\n<br />\nchance of experimenting with<br />\ndemocracy in its pure form. At<br />\nthe present, this has not been<br />\ndone, we've been experimenting<br />\nwith an oligargy.

Unfortunately, the referendum on the<br />\nHonor Code could be entirely meaningless, since the proposals,<br />\nif they are approved by the students, will go to a by-laws<br />\ncommittee, which will then do the actual writing of new rules<br />\nfor the Honor Commission.<br />\nThe by-laws committee will have as its only official student<br />\ninput the SC's somewhat vague\"substantive recommendations,\"<br />\nwhich appeared in undergraduate mailboxes yesterday. The<br />\ncommittee would be in no way bound by any of the<br />\nrecommendations and could thus modify, adjust or even ignore<br />\nthem. The votes Of undergraduates would then become totally<br />\nmeaningless.<br />\nIf this issue were not so serious, if it did not go to the very<br />\nheart of what a university education stands for, then the<br />\nStudent Council's sloppy action on the honor code report<br />\nwould be nothing more than another typical student political<br />\nfarce. But the Honor Code matter is a crucial one, and the<br />\nCouncil's ill-considered plan to deal with the report is one of<br />\nthe most egregious mistakes made here in memory.<br />\nThe only sensible course for the SC is to withdraw its<br />\nrecommendations, draft a comprehensive Honor Code,<br />\nembodying the recommendations in the current report and<br />\nsubmit that proposed Code to a binding student referendum.<br />\nAny other action would only justify undergraduates' long-felt<br />\ncontempt for the Council.<br /><br />\nThe popular politics of capital punishment<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\n\"I like the sound of it,\"<br />\nremarked Nelson Rockefeller in<br />\nreference to President Nixon's<br />\nSaturday afternoon special on law<br />\nand order.

Sure,<br />\nfrom time to time there's a wellwritten story with something to<br />\nsay, normally a minor scandal of<br />\nthe \"administrators botching up<br />\nbut hinting at imminent progregs\"<br />\nvariety, written like a press release<br />\nfrom Public Information, Hopkins'<br />\nown Pravda.<br />\nWe'll often comment on some<br />\nfaculty members who enjoy research so much that they're never<br />\nable to teach, or even to be on<br />\ncampus more than two semesters<br />\nin a row. We might discuss that<br />\npowerful anachronism, the Academic Council, the campus House of<br />\nLords. Often we polemicize against<br />\nthe departmental fiefdoms here, of<br />\nwhich the 14th century Church<br />\nwould be envious. Sometimes we'll<br />\nscream about tuition increases, or<br />\nthe sheer incompetence of graduate student TA's in History, English and Math; or even about the<br />\nridiculous committees George Benton sets up to amuse himself on<br />\nthose rare days he spends on campus.<br />\nBut on the whole, the NewsLetter is about as informative as<br />\nthe back of a raisin bran box.<br />\nSo much for the factual content.<br />\nOur editorials are often not much<br />\nbetter. When they have the facts<br />\nstraight, they range from otiose to<br />\ninsipid._<br />\nThus runs the traditional philosophy. It has probably never occured to you, however, that all this<br /><br />\nbumbling, seemingly-incompetent<br />\noutput is in fact a ruse for the valuable Cabalistic information which<br />\ninheres in our pages, in the form of<br />\nacronyms, puzzles, and meaningful<br />\ntypographical errors.<br />\nFind that hard to believe? Try<br />\nthis:<br />\nThe News-Letter is ghost-written<br />\nby sentient beings from outer<br />\nspace who, like Provost Harry<br />\nWoolf, have \"difficulty speaking in<br />\nAnglo-Saxon thought units.\"<br />\nFar-fetched?

Ahem. George<br />\nBenton thought the idea of an<br />\nEmployment Service would be<br />\nworthwhile, in light of cutbacks in<br />\nfederal funding, and the $300 t4ition hike. His enthusiasm mounted<br />\nwhen it appeared that a black<br />\nwoman would accept the directorship of the Service, thus creating<br />\nthe impression that the University<br />\nis truly concerned with remedying<br />\nits disgustingly poor record of<br />\nminority and women hiring.<br />\nWhen the woman decided to<br />\ntake another job, everyone's interest waned. I personally applied for<br />\nthe directorship of the Employment Service, but Personnel Director J. Lyon Rogers, in an interview<br />\nabout as exciting as watching paint<br />\ndry, told me that the position had<br />\nbeen abolished. The whole business<br />\nwas being re-thought, he said.<br /><br />\nBy this time, John Riina, Director of Admissions and Financial<br />\nAid, his office already one full<br />\nmonth behind schedule in all its<br />\nactivities, had passed the Service<br />\nfrom his office, where it logically<br />\nbelongs, back to Benton. Benton,<br />\nin turn, passed the buck over to<br />\nthe Personnel Office.<br />\nFive weeks after the Service was<br />\nto have gotten underway, Benton<br />\nand Edward Warfield, in Personnel,<br />\ndecided to do something.

This year under the new<br />\nrules we can use a swimmer in<br />\nthree relays, and with Milne and<br />\nHorning \u2022 this should help us<br />\ntremendotnly. So many things<br />\ncan happen, a lot rests on fate<br />\nbut we have a shot at it,<br />\nexpecially if we can get an early<br />\nlead.\"<br />\nSince there are 85 teams<br />\nparticipating, anything can<br />\nindeed happen. The afternoon<br />\ntrials are an important aspect of<br />\nthe Championships because the<br />\ntwelve swimmers who can score<br />\npoints are determined in these<br />\nraces. Of the twelve qualifiers six<br />\nenter the final heat while the<br />\nothers make up the consolation<br />\nheat.

When Hopkins placed<br />\nsixth last year, Northridge and<br />\nIrvine tied for second behind<br />\nNorthern Michigan, which has<br />\nsince joined the University<br />\nDivision ranks. Eastern Illinois<br />\nand Springfield have good<br />\npotential too, but a pre-season<br />\npoll placed Hopkins second<br />\nbehind Irvine. The strength of<br />\nIrvine lies in Tom Boughy, Brad<br /><br />\nGunter Clocker.<br /><br />\nschools can affect the<br />\ncompetition among major<br />\npowers.<br />\nComfort feels that mistakes<br />\nand fortune can play a big role<br />\nbut every team has that to<br />\ncontend with. That is why<br />\nkeeping cool in the face of<br />\nadversity could be a factor in<br />\nwinning the match.<br />\nThursday should be a big day<br />\nfor the Blue Jays in the scoring<br />\ndepartment. Milne and Horning<br />\nwill both be swimming in the<br />\nindividual medley and the<br />\nmedley relay which means a<br />\ngood start for Hopkins. Bob<br />\nStoever and probably Vince<br />\nNigrelli will be in this relay too.<br />\nStoever and Tom Stenovec<br />\nshould do well in the 500 yard<br />\nfree style while Bob Schwenkler<br />\nand Jim Finnerty will be in the<br />\n50 yard sprint where \"anything<br />\ncan happen.\"<br />\nFriday may be a weak day for<br />\nHopkins. We have no diver or 100<br />\nyard breast stroker and only a<br /><br />\nslight bit in the 200 yard free<br />\nstyle. Irvine has no diver either<br />\nbut Northridge could pick up<br />\npoints in this event. On the<br />\nbrighter side of Friday, Horning<br />\nand ,Fortner are both expected<br />\nto do very well in the 100 yard<br />\nbackstroke as are Stenovec and.<br />\nStoever in the 400 yard<br />\nindividual medley. Having two<br />\nstrong contenders in these events<br />\nis very helpful in counteracting<br />\nthe effect of a surprising<br />\nswimmer from another school.<br />\nThe 800 yard free style relay<br />\nshould do well too.<br />\nTop Contenders<br />\nWhile there are more than too<br />\nmany variables to predict the<br />\noutcome, past performance has<br />\nshown that Hopkins will be<br />\namong the top contenders.<br />\nCoach Comfort's main desire is<br />\nto finish better than the sixth<br />\nplace of last year and with the<br />\nimprovement of this season there<br />\nis no question that it will<br />\nhappen.<br /><br />\non April 4 and travel to the<br />\nPhiladelphia College of PharmacY<br />\nten days later.<br />\nSee-Saw<br />\nSaturday's match started with<br />\nHopkins captain Griff Lewis<br />\namassing an impressive 260 score<br />\nout of a possible 300.

The<br />\nannual meeting with the<br />\nWolfpack was \u2022reduced to<br />\nscrimmage status this year to<br />\nmake room for the Cornell game,<br />\nyet this did not reduce the<br />\ntraditional competitiveness of a<br />\nHopkins\u2014Mt.

Even<br /><br />\nwithout this firepower the<br />\nvisitors managed to stay close<br />\nand gave the Jays a real workout.<br />\nHopkins showed much<br />\nimprovement over their earlier<br />\npractices as the passing and<br />\nground ball play was crisper, but<br />\nwork still remains in these and<br />\nother aspects of the game. On<br />\nattack, efforts to work as a unit<br />\nrather than relying on individual<br />\nplay resulted in several fine<br />\nscore-, producing passes and<br />\nfeeds. Middie Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nand attackmen Bill Nolan and<br />\nDon Krohn each tallied three<br />\ntimes, converting feeds for every<br />\nscore, while junior Jack Thomas<br />\nserved up six of the nine Jay<br />\nassists.<br />\nDefensively, Hopkins has yet<br />\nto show the spark that marked<br />\nlast year's play.

Since<br />\nthe team lost only three<br />\nlettermen through graduation,<br />\ntrack fans should be able to look<br />\nforward to shis spring with<br />\nunbounded optimism.<br />\nThis would be the case at most<br />\nschools anyway, but at Hopkins<br />\nthe situation is different.<br />\nPerforming in the shadow of the<br />\nlacrosse team and missing all<br />\nthose games demands a special<br />\nkind of' dedication, and attrition<br />\n\u2022 has taken its annual toll of<br />\nlettermen again this year. Half<br />\nthe battle for the track staff is<br />\nconvincing the runners, jumpers,<br />\nand throwers that it is more fun<br />\nto perform on the track than to<br />\nwatch the lacrosse team play on<br />\nSaturday. For Head-coach Don<br />\nMasken, it is a constant struggle<br />\nto persuade his talent to<br />\ndisregard lacrosse.<br />\nLed by returning co-captains<br />\nGerry Greenfield and Tim<br />\nGarton, the team does have some<br />\ndepth in the field events. In<br />\naddition to this pair, returning<br />\nlettermen Andy Schreiber (the<br />\nbasketball player) and Earl Dryer<br />\nwill compete in the long jump.<br />\nThe same outfit, minus<br />\nGreenfield, will also handle the<br />\ntriple jump.<br />\nIn the high jump, Garton and<br />\nGreenfield will team with<br />\nsophomore Gary Culbertson<br />\n(whose brother played freshman<br />\nfootball for the Hopkins in 1969).<br />\nThe pole vault should be in good<br />\nhands when Garton and<br />\nletterman Mike Molina are joined<br />\nby freshman Stuart Dickinson, a<br />\nstandout from St. Albans.<br />\nThe weight events look strong<br />\nagain this year. Returning<br />\nlettermen include Al \"Who,<br />\nWho\" Schiff and Hal Altman in<br />\nthe shot put, Altman and Lou<br />\nWolfin in the discus, and John<br />\n\"Dover\" Veil in the javelin. New<br />\nto the squad this year are<br />\nsophomore Jim Macer (shot),<br />\nfreshman Alex Glogau (shot),<br />\nand freshman George Steinfels,<br />\n(javelin).<br /><br />\nThe team's lack of depth is<br />\nmost noticable in the running<br />\nevents particularly in the high<br />\nhurdles where Greenfield is the<br />\nonly competitor.

It<br />\nstarted many things which can be<br />\ncarried on in the next Council.<br />\nFurthermore, I think that we can<br />\nexpound on the teacher<br />\nevaluation, for example. For the<br />\nmost part I. think that the<br />\nCouncil did a good job this year<br />\nand I want the good wI5rk to<br />\ncarry on.<br />\nAndy Savitz: (The question.<br />\nI<br /><br />\nthat was asked Savitz was the<br />\nfollowing: Why did you<br />\ndeliberate to the degree that you<br />\ndid about running?) At first, no<br />\none would take me seriously<br />\nabout not running. But when<br />\nenough people talked to me<br />\nabout it, I was convinced to run<br />\nagain. What really pushed me<br />\nover the edge was talking with<br />\nmy parents, a few administrators<br />\nand with some of my friends.<br />\nThat's what took me so long.<br />\nQ.: How do you think you are<br />\nqualified? Barish: One of my<br />\nqualifications is that I have not<br />\nbeen involved in the Student<br />\nGovernment before. But, I have<br />\nbeen in High school activities and<br />\nI have administered organizations<br />\nbefore.<br />\nFarber: I think that my first<br />\nqualification is that I'm an<br />\nundergradUate student and I<br />\nthink that any undergraduate is<br />\nqualified to run. It's nonsense to<br />\nlist activities to dazzle everyone.<br />\nBut to ge,t down to my activities:<br />\nI'm spokeswomen for the<br />\nWomen's Center and I suppose<br />\nthat I've tried to work with the<br />\nwomen on this campus more<br />\nthan any Student Council<br />\nmember. Also, last year I was on<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies.<br />\n'Rasmussen: I've done most<br />\neverything else: I've been on the<br />\nStudent Council, I've been on the<br />\nOrientation Committee, and I've<br />\nbeen on the Student Council for<br />\ntwo years.<br />\nNews-Letter :1 think that we<br />\nknow your qualifications, Andy<br />\nQ.: What kind of<br />\nrepresentative would you be if<br />\nelected, a representative of the<br />\nentire student body Dr a special<br /><br />\nchance of experimenting with<br />\ndemocracy in its pure form. At<br />\nthe present, this has not been<br />\ndone, we've been experimenting<br />\nwith an oligargy. I hope to create<br />\nsome kind of Student<br />\nCommission to represent.<br />\nstudents and also to try to Come<br />\nup with a way to raise the 18<br />\npercent to 20 percent response<br />\nreceived for elections and<br />\nreferendums.<br />\nFarber: When you're spending<br />\nmoney on the things that the<br />\nStudent Council spends money<br />\nfor, you have to ask the student<br />\nbody what it wants, because in<br />\nreality, it is their money. When<br />\nyou. come down to it, the<br />\nStudent Council controls<br />\neverything from the movies we<br />\nsee to the food we eat in the.<br />\ncafeteria, so the students should<br />\nhave a say in the picking of these<br />\nthings. What also should be done<br />\nis anyone interested in workin2<br /><br />\nLeon Barish<br />\nstudent representation at the<br />\nUniversity I think that there<br />\nshould be much more<br />\nrepresentation.<br />\n\u2022 Q.: Now that the<br />\nCouncil has dealt with such issues<br />\nas\u2022 the Honor Code, what three<br />\nthings would you like to see th<br /><br />\nAndrew Savitz<br />\non any facet of the Council<br />\nCouncil do in the future, both on<br />\nshould be invited to do so. We<br />\ncampus and off?<br />\ndon't have to go through an<br />\nRasmussen Well, first of all let<br />\nelitest selections Committee to<br />\nme say that regardless of who's<br />\nfill positions.<br />\nelected president, certain things<br />\nRasmussen: I think that I<br />\nare going to happen no matter<br />\nwhat. We are going to have<br />\nmovies no matter who's president<br />\nof the Student Council, we will<br />\nalways have some sort of Health<br />\nService. The difference is the if<br />\nI'm elected there is going to be a<br />\nsystem wherby students are going<br />\nto have more of a choice in how<br />\ndecisions are made. But, I can't<br />\npinpoint three things that I<br />\nwould like to see the Student<br />\nCouncil do because I object to a<br />\npresident pushing his idead down<br />\nthe throats of the student body.<br />\nMindy: Particularly, I think<br />\nthat the Student Council should<br />\nto what the student body wants<br />\nMindy Farber<br />\nit to do. But, I do have some<br />\ninterest representative?<br />\nissues that I would` like to see<br />\nwould like to see more people<br />\nBarish: If I'm elected I'm<br />\ntackled. One of them is housing<br />\ninvolved in the Council. This year<br />\ngoing to create a system in which<br />\non campus. The only word to<br />\nthere were some new people and<br />\nall students are represented. In an<br />\ndescribe it is \"abominable\": It is<br />\nI'd like to see this trend<br />\nundergraduate student body of continue. I don't give a damn<br />\n2,000, we have a very good<br />\nthat the guy working is or is not<br />\na member of the Student<br />\nCouncil, it's just the fact that<br />\nhe's working that counts.<br />\nSavitz: I feel this way, that<br />\nRIGHTS,from page 1<br />\nwhen this Student Council was<br />\nelected last year, there was no<br />\nCiting drug abuse as an<br />\nstudent representation on this<br />\nexample, the shielding of<br />\ncampus. Therefore, the main<br />\nstudents would be<br />\n\"unequal,<br />\npriority was to get some<br />\nupper middle class privilege.\"<br />\n(representation) and I kept this<br />\nHowever, Howard elaborated,<br />\npretty well within the confinds \"We are not here to pull in<br />\nof the Student Council and that<br />\nstudent first offenders,<br />\nsmall number of people. The<br />\nparticularly into criminal<br />\nreason that this was done, was<br />\npunishment.\" He said that he<br />\nthat I thought the representation<br />\nfavors a \"medical, mental point<br />\nwas so tenuous that by spreading<br />\nof view.\"<br />\nit out, it would be weakened.<br />\nIt is still unclear whether the<br />\nEric Rasmussen<br />\nNow that there is definite<br />\ncode will be specific or very<br /><br />\nrediculous for a major city<br />\nuniversity not to offer every<br />\nstudent housing. I don't think<br />\nthat there is any excuse to tell<br />\nFreshmen that they have to go<br />\nfrom the dormitories, which are<br />\nterrible to begin with, to the rat<br />\ninfested housing down there in<br />\nthe student ghetto, which is no<br />\npicnic.<br />\nThe other problem that I see is<br />\nthe fact that you are on a campus<br />\nwith very little culture...for a<br />\nmajor University we have<br />\nabsolutely no social life.<br />\nI would also like to get<br />\ninvolved with the other<br />\nparticipating Universities in the<br />\nNational Student Union or in the<br />\nNational Student Lobby. We<br />\nshould deal with some national<br />\nissues, such as the amnesty<br />\nquestion.<br />\nRasmussen: An immediate<br />\nthing that comes to mind, one<br />\nthat has been tried before, is to<br />\nestablish more cooperation<br />\nbetween Goucher and Hopkins,<br />\nexpecially now that we are goint<br />\nto establish some sort of living<br />\narrangement with Goucher.<br />\nThe second thing which has<br />\nalready been mentioned, is the<br />\nteacher evaluation. I would like<br />\nto see that carried out and<br />\ncarried out successfully so that it<br />\nbecomes one of the factors in<br />\nhow the University looks at its<br />\nfaculty and how the students<br />\nlooks at the faculty.<br />\nSavitz: Well. I basically agree<br />\nwith Eric. I would like to<br />\ncontinue to meet with the Board<br />\nof Trustees and to work out<br />\npossible solutions to any future<br />\ntuition hikes. I would hope that<br />\nthe Student Council will have a<br />\nvery successful social season.<br />\nPersonlly, I want to insure the<br />\nstudent he will get a voice in<br />\nwhat happens here at the<br />\nUniversity, which happened<br />\npartially this year and hopefully<br />\nto a greater extent next year.<br /><br />\nDiscipline discussed<br />\ngeneral in nature. \"I'd hate to<br />\nhave things so nebulous that the<br />\nstudent didn't know what he did<br />\nwrong,\" said Sheppard.<br />\nPeggy Arps, a committee<br />\nmember, explained that the<br />\ncommittee has been divided into<br />\ngroups of two and has been<br />\nassigned to seek interested people<br />\ntoSteven sacks, a lower with the<br />\nMaryland Attorney General's<br />\nOffice, has been asked to offer<br />\nrecommendations.
