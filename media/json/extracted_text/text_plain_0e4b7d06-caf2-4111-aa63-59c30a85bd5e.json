Polk Printing Company, 1930 Clifton Ave., Baltimore, Md. over a tired Blue Jay team shows<br />\na top-heavy score.<br /><br />\nEDITORIALS<br />\nThe Perfect Day<br />\nAmidst much so-called \"mud<br />\nslinging\" and bulldozing of freshmen, another disagreeable period<br />\nknown as pledge day has passed.<br />\nAll the bad traits of each fraternity<br />\nman on the campus have' been<br />\nbrought to light and discussed at<br />\nlength. Any scandal that has taken<br />\nplace at Hopkins during the past<br />\nten years, has been told and retold<br />\nwithin the last twenty-four hours,<br />\nand a few imaginary ones created<br />\nas well. Freshmen have probably<br />\nformed the opinion that the joining of a fraternity is the most important step in their college life.<br />\nWe hope that the Interfraternity<br />\nBoard will seriously consider - abolishing the present system. To avoid<br />\nall this unpleasantness, it would<br />\nmerely be necessary for the bids to<br />\nbe placed in the post office boxes of<br />\nthe freshman at the beginning of<br />\nthe silent period, and allow the<br />\nfirst year men to make their own<br />\ndecisions.<br /><br />\nThe Newspaper News<br />\nBy some very sad mistake a rumor to the effect that the authorities had decided to do away with<br />\nintercollegiate football, slipped out<br />\ntwo weeks. In the first place this<br />\nrumor never should have leaked<br />\nout, but having leaked out, something should have been done, at<br />\nleast to keep the tongues on the<br />\ncampus quiet and let the papers<br />\nthrash around among themselves<br />\nuntil they should have found they<br />\nhad no facts upon which to base<br />\ntheir articles.<br />\nSince the word got out that we<br />\nhad taken the drastic step lots of<br />\nto-do has been made. Resolutions<br />\nhave been adopted by bodies, petitions have been signed pro and con.<br />\nThe papers of our city and other<br />\nlarge cities throughout the country<br />\nhave taken up the story, enlarged<br />\nupon it to such an extent that it<br />\nhas been said one paper spread on<br />\nits front page \"HOPKINS TO<br /><br />\nSEVER ALL INTER-COLLEGIATE RELATIONS.\"<br />\n\u20140\u2014<br />\nThis absurd situation must end<br />\nsomewhere. Already it has had its<br />\neffect uon the men who had planned<br />\nto enter college next year. Some<br />\nof the men, athletes and students,<br />\nwho had planned to come to Hopkins, hearing about the non-athletic<br />\nideas for the future, have switched<br />\nover and now play to go to Maryland and St. Johns. This is the<br />\nsame situation which occurred in<br />\n_1925 and 1927 just after the announcement of the intention of the<br />\nadoption of the Goodman Plan.<br />\nThe latest development on the<br />\ncampus has been a petition signed<br />\nby some twenty-five undergraduates in favor of the abolishing of<br />\nfootball. When the leader of this<br />\ndocument was questioned for his<br />\nreasons for taking such a step, his<br />\nreply was to the effect that we have<br />\nbeen having poor teams, so do away<br />\nwith the sport. If this is the only<br />\nreason that can be given, it shows<br />\nthat the Johns Hopkins students<br />\nare yellow. They're afraid to face<br />\nthe music when they are defeated.<br />\nWhy shouldn't we take a few defeats, keep our heads and come<br />\nback with a winning team with the<br />\nwhole University and whole graduate body behind us?<br />\n\u20140\u2014<br />\nIf we do away with football, the<br />\nabolishionists suggest, we put up a<br />\ncage. But if we do away with inter-collegiate football, will the<br />\ngraduates support a cage? They<br />\nwill not.<br />\nThe sooner we on the campus<br />\ncurb these resolutions, these petitions, and give a definite statement<br />\nto the public at large that intercollegiate relations will be continued, at least until the undergraduate department has been done<br />\naway with, the undergraduate department of the future and the athletic teams of the future will mlprove.<br /><br />\nSAMUEL KIRK &amp; SON, Inc.<br />\nJewelers\u2014Stationers\u2014SiIversmiths<br />\n421 North Charles Street<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nWRIST WATCHES FOR MEN<br />\nGIFTS IN SILVERWARE<br />\nFINE STATIONERY<br /><br />\nWon 3, Lost 3<br />\nA victory tonight, will place<br />\nHopkins back in the running for<br />\nthe State championship.
