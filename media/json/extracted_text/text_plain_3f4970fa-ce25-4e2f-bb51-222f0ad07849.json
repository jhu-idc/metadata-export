This suggestion was adopted as policy with<br />\nthe beginning of the 1985 fall<br />\nterm. This change, however,<br />\ndoes not affect those students<br />\ncurrently enrolled in the major.<br />\nThe committee that studied<br />\nthe Natural Science Area Major was composed of Lloyd<br />\nArmstrong, Maurice Bessman,<br />\nHans Eugster, David Olton,<br />\nDouglas Poland (chairman),<br />\nand Martha Roseman. They<br />\nreviewed the present status of<br />\nthe area major and compared it<br />\nto other standard science<br />\nmajors.<br />\nIn the past, according to<br />\ntheir report, the requirements<br />\nfor the major were: 40 (N)<br />\ncredits (including chemistry and<br />\nlab, physics,and lab, and 15<br />\ncredits beyond the 300 level), 36<br />\n(H), (Q), or (S) credits, and<br />\nother unspecified courses to obtain a total of 120 credits. A<br />\nNatural Science Area Major is<br />\noften adopted by pre-meds,<br />\n<br />\nsays the report, because it permits them to fullfill all their<br />\npre-med requirements (inorganic and organic chemistry,<br />\ntheir respective labs, MCB and<br />\nlab, physics and lab\u201e and<br />\ncalculus.) Almost half(43 percent) of the students graduating<br />\nin the natural sciences receive<br />\ntheir Baccalaureate degree in<br />\nthe Natural Science Area Major.<br />\nThe report concluded that<br />\nthe Natural Science Area Major lacks depth, consisting of<br />\nlarge, introductory classes with<br />\nonly one required 300 level<br />\ncourse. The report characterized the major as a minimal<br />\n\"Pre-med Major\" for a larger<br />\nnumber of undergraduates.<br />\nHowever, the committee did<br />\nnot wish to abandon the major<br />\nfor two reasons. First, by forcing all students presently enrolled in the area major to adopt<br />\na more traditional science, the<br />\nsmall, highly specialized,<br />\nupper-level science laboratories<br />\nwould be swamped by the flux<br />\nof new students. Secondly,<br />\neliminating the major would<br />\nnot afford students the opportunity and flexibility to construct a program that spans two<br />\ntraditional fields.<br />\n<br />\nLater Shuttle<br />\nPlanned for<br />\nExcursions<br />\nto Peabody<br />\nby Jay Lechtman and<br />\naathy Wu<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nMatthew Crenson, associate dean of arts and sciences.<br />\n<br />\nFrom the recommendations<br />\nof the committee, the new<br />\npolicy regarding the major includes: a new name\u2014the<br />\nNatural Science major, organic<br />\nchemistry and lab and biology<br />\nand lab (if pre-med) or 20<br />\ncredits of introductory or<br />\nupper-level science and<br />\nmathematics (if not premed)in<br />\naddition to chemistry and lab,<br />\nphysics and lab, and one year<br />\nof calculus.<br />\nAlso, five one-semester<br />\ncourses at the 300 level or higher,<br />\ntotaling at least 15 credits, 30<br />\n(H)and (S)credits, one year of<br />\nan elementary college-level<br />\n<br />\nmodern language, and an<br />\noverall grade point average of<br />\nat least 2.0 are additional<br />\nrequirements.<br />\nApart from the change in<br />\ncurriculum requirements, each<br />\nscience department assigns a<br />\nfaculty advisor to oversee the<br />\nprograms of those Natural<br />\nScience Area Majors concentrating their studies within that<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nIn regard to the other two<br />\ncommittees, Crenson says that<br />\ndeliberations concerning the<br />\nHumanities and the Social and<br />\nBehavioral Science Area majors<br />\nwill continue.<br />\n<br />\nScholarship Info<br />\nThe National Science<br />\nFoundation is awarding<br />\nthree-year<br />\ngraduate<br />\nfellowhips in science and<br />\nengineering for students who<br />\nare at or near the beginning<br />\nof their graduate study.<br />\nFellowships are awarded<br />\nin the mathematical,<br />\nbiological,<br />\nphysical,<br />\nengineering, and social<br />\nsciences and in the history<br />\nand philosophy of science.<br />\nThe stipend is $11,100 for<br />\na twelve-month tenure.

Meets the West<br />\nFor a Day?<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\nby Scott Proestel<br />\n<br />\nTwo things need to be said about the<br />\nnew Fall Break. The first is that it is<br />\nessentially meaningless. The second is<br />\nthat it represents a major accomplishment for students.<br />\nThe break is more or less unimportant<br />\nin that one day is hardly going to make<br />\na dramatic difference in anyone's life. It<br />\ncertainly will be nice, and even that one<br />\nday will relieve some of the infamous<br />\nfall-semester pressure; however, it will<br />\nmost emphatically not change the way<br />\nstudents view the term. The fall will still<br />\nrepresent one long, monotonous block<br />\nof classes.<br />\nWhat is much more important is that,<br />\nentirely because of student action the<br />\nbreak has been established and<br />\nremarkably quickly.<br />\nIt was only last winter, after all, that<br />\nthe Student Council formed its Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee on Fall Break. After conduc-<br />\n<br />\nting a survey of Hopkins students and<br />\nof other colleges, the panel began lobbying the administration for such a<br />\nvacation.<br />\nResponding to those efforts, the administration decided to go ahead with a<br />\nfall break, and rearranged the calendar<br />\naccordingly this summer.<br />\nAll of that ought to make any concerned student quite happy. Not only has the<br />\nadministration listened to student concerns, but something far more unusual<br />\nhas happened: Hopkins students have<br />\ngotten off their rumps and taken an active role in improving the university.<br />\nThat just doesn't happen around here.<br />\nSo although the break itself is nothing<br />\nto get too excited about, the way it came<br />\nabout is truly remarkable. Maybe<br />\nstudents will actually start caring what<br />\ngoes on around here.<br />\n<br />\nOne More Dean<br />\nDeans have been increasing around<br />\nhere the last few years as fast as tuition.<br />\nOnly four years ago, just one year<br />\nbefore the current senior class arrived,<br />\nthere was one dean in charge of<br />\nHomewood. The following year two<br />\ndeans were given joint command. And<br />\nnow a triad of top-ranking people has<br />\nbeen created. Whether a three-headed<br />\nbeast can run with any direction remains<br />\nto be seen.<br />\nIt seems, intuitively, that there must<br />\nbe one man at the top; someone must be<br />\nin charge. University President Steven<br />\nMuller is both unwilling and unable to<br />\nfill that post: unwilling in that he is<br />\nprimarily interested in Hopkins' international aspects; unable in that his energy<br />\nmust be largely devoted to the university's other divisions.<br />\nSo until four years ago, George Owen,<br />\ndean of the Homewood faculties, was<br />\nresponsible for handling campus affairs.<br />\nWhen he retired, control of the campus<br />\nwas turned over to two deans: the Dean<br />\nof the School of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nthe Dean of the G.W.C. Whiting School<br />\nof Engineering. That system lasted a couple years, even when one of the two head<br />\ndeans changed.(Arts and Sciences chief<br />\nSigmund Suskind resigned and was<br />\nreplaced by George Fisher.) Last spring,<br />\nit was announced that a new top-ranking<br />\nposition would be created: the Dean of<br />\nAdministration. Robert Welch, the new<br />\nkid on the block this fall, was hired to<br />\nfill the slot.<br />\nWhen the new position was created,<br />\nit was said a third dean would allow<br />\nFisher and Dean of the G.W.C. School<br />\nof Engineering V. David VandeLinde to<br />\nfocus on academic concerns, while<br />\navoiding administrative hassles.<br />\nBut just how much the new system will<br />\n<br />\nstreamline administrative decisions is<br />\nunknown. Complaints have been frequent the last two years that no one<br />\nseemed in charge much of the time.<br />\nWhen a decision was needed, the two<br />\ndeans would have to consult, often a<br />\ntime-consuming process.<br />\nWith the addition of yet another dean,<br />\nit seems natural that situation would only<br />\nworsen. Muller argues, however, that the<br />\nresponsibilities of the three deans are sufficiently distinct to avoid a directionless<br />\nmuddle at the top.<br />\nTo at least a certain extent, that may<br />\nbe true. Administrative concerns will<br />\nnow have to be brought before only one<br />\ndean. On those issues at least, that could<br />\nmean a smoother operation.<br />\nBut even on academic issues, where<br />\nFisher and VandeLinde will continue<br />\ntheir joint rule, there may be an advantage to the new structure. As part of<br />\nWelch's hiring, the position of Associate<br />\nDean of Undergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudies was abolished. While some of<br />\nwhat Brush did will fall under Welch's<br />\ncontrol, much will be handled by Fisher<br />\nand VandeLinde's deputies. Brush's<br />\nposition within the administration had<br />\nbecome increasingly unclear, an the<br />\nabolition of what had become, in<br />\nMuller's words, a \"redundant\" position<br />\nshould facilitate quick decisions on<br />\nacademic matters.<br />\nStudents ought to have a healthy skepticism about the new administrative<br />\nstructure. At first glance, it appears to<br />\nworsen an already bad situation. But it<br />\nis also true that it provides an opportunity to improve how Homewood is run.<br />\nOnly the next few months(and the first<br />\nfew crises) will reveal if that opportunity has been seized.<br />\n<br />\nYou've seen it every<br />\nsummer\u2014for three months out<br />\nof the year, the East Coast<br />\ndresses like the West Coast.<br />\nSummer rolls in, and with it<br />\ncomes the Ocean Pacific Principle. It states that although the<br />\nAtlantic is an ocean also, it<br />\nsomehow doen't quite match<br />\nup to the Pacific. So people in<br />\nthe East dress like they're in<br />\nCalifornia, and pretend that the<br />\nPacific is fifty yards from their<br />\ncondo.<br />\nMany clothes manufacturers<br />\nhave made millions off of this<br />\nsimple principle. Have you ever<br />\nseen Ocean Pacific's spring<br />\nline?(A rhetorical question.) It<br />\nactually looks a great deal like<br />\ntheir winter line. Whether it's<br />\nextra-long green baggies, or<br />\nextra-long pink baggies, their<br />\nOp logo is nearby. But you<br />\ndon't have to take my word for<br />\nit\u2014just look around. The<br />\nextra-large shirts with bright<br />\nlettering or surfers riding blue<br />\nwaves are a sure giveaway.<br />\nI am a capitalist, and I think<br />\nit's great that clothing<br />\nmanufacturers can make<br />\nmoney off of our fantasies. It<br />\ngives me a warm feeling inside<br />\nwhenever I see \"Surf Naked\"<br />\nor \"Life's a Beach\" tee-shirts<br />\nthat a company has churned<br />\nout. It isn't with them that I<br />\nhave a problem. What really<br />\nannoys me is the sunglass craze<br />\nthat tagged along with the<br />\nclothing fad.<br />\nI enjoy looking into people's<br />\neyes. You can understand a lot<br />\nabout a person by searching in<br />\ntheir eyes. You can tell how<br />\ntheir day has been, if something<br />\n<br />\nis bothering them, or if they feel<br />\nlike going out to eat. However,<br />\nwith the advent of sunglasses,<br />\nthis has all been changed. The<br />\nsilent two-way communication<br />\nhas been destroyed. Trying to<br />\nlook into they eyes of someone<br />\nwearing sunglasses is like looking into a black abyss. Unless<br />\nof course they are wearing mirrored sunglasses\u2014then you get<br />\nto look into your own eyes,<br />\nwhich is stupid because you<br />\nalready know how you feel.<br />\nYou only have to see a girl<br />\nbat her eyes once to realize that<br />\neyes<br />\nare<br />\na<br />\npowerful<br />\naphrodisiac. But yet some people insist on covering up their<br />\neyes with sunglasses anyway.<br />\nBy far the worst offenders are<br />\nmirrored sunglasses. The girl<br />\nthat you wanted to go out with<br />\nyesterday now looks like the<br />\ncockroach you killed last night.<br />\nThere is one advantage to<br />\nwearing sunglasses. You may<br />\nnot want people looking into<br />\nyour eyes and understanding<br />\nhow you feel. This form of<br />\ncommunication may be an annoyance to you. But, if that is<br />\nthe case, you might as well dig<br />\na hole now, and live (and die)<br />\nthere.<br />\nIn conclusion, I believe my<br />\nopinion is best expressed by an<br />\nancient manuscript recently<br />\ndiscovered in Asia:<br />\nCalifornia,<br />\nYour girls may be great,<br />\nAnd your wine may be fine,<br />\nYour baggies are colorful,<br />\nBut are no friends of mine,<br />\nThough there are things<br />\nthe East may lack,<br />\nPlease, CA, please, take<br />\nyour sunglasses back.<br />\n\u2014Kubla Khan<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nMary Ginder<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nT.J.

I also had<br />\nsome friends there, and my<br />\nGerman was pretty good; so<br />\nVienna seemed like the right<br />\nchoice.<br />\nIt turned out to be the perfect<br />\none.<br />\nI arrived in a rainy Vienna on<br />\nSept. 16 with a cold that I had<br />\ncaught back in the States. According to my folder filled with<br />\npapers from the University of<br />\nVienna, class started on Oct. 1,<br />\nand I thought that two weeks<br />\nwould be enough time to<br />\nmatriculate, register and start<br />\nto familiarize myself with Vienna. Instead, it was during this<br />\ntime that I got my first taste of<br />\nViennese bureaucracy.<br />\nActually, it was easier for me<br />\nthan most foreign students<br />\nbecause a colleague of my<br />\nfather's at the University had<br />\nalready taken care of the<br />\npreliminary paper work. So I<br />\nentered the central office of the<br />\nUniversity through \"little door<br />\nnumber six,\" as it is affectionately called, expecting only minor problems if any. I<br />\nlooked for the ofice that deals<br />\nwith foreign students; I did not<br />\nhave to look very far. The line<br />\nextended so far down a long<br />\ncorridor with people chattering<br />\naway in every language except<br />\nGerman that it was impossible<br />\nto confuse the office for<br />\nanything but an immigration<br />\ncenter. I was advised by the<br />\nwise assistant of my father's<br />\ncolleague to return right after<br />\nthe lunch break in the hope of<br />\nfinding a smaller line.<br />\nWhen I returned the line had<br />\nindeed shrunk, and after a mere<br />\n45 minutes I was actually inside<br />\nthe room, and I could see what<br />\n<br />\nwas going on behind the<br />\ncounter. One young lady was<br />\nbusy doodling on a pad, a<br />\nmiddle-aged man was yelling<br />\nfor coffee and cake, a lady who<br />\nlooked like a witch was giving<br />\nsomeopne a hard time, and a<br />\nblond youth wa slowly, very<br />\nslowly \"processing\" someone.<br />\nFinally, it was my turn to be<br />\nprocessed by him.<br />\n\"Where is your birth<br />\ncertificate?\"<br />\n\"How about my passport?\"<br />\nI replied. \"My birth certificate<br />\nis in the United States because<br />\nI was not informed that I would<br />\nneed it.\"<br />\nSince my passport was not<br />\nadequate proof of my existence, I was told to return<br />\nwhen I could produce my birth<br />\ncertificate. Furthermore, I also<br />\nhad not gone for a physical<br />\nwhich is another requirement<br />\nfor matriculation at the University of Vienna. I called home to<br />\nask my parents to send a copy<br />\nof my birth certificate, and then<br />\nI stood on line for about two<br />\nand a half hours to have an xray taken for tuberculosis. My<br />\nnon-existing self had highly<br />\nphotogenic lungs.<br />\nI returned to the adminstration office a week later with the<br />\nproper documents in hand. The<br />\nyoung lady ws no longer doodling; she was staring into space<br />\nwith a glazed look in her eyes.<br />\nThe middle-aged man had gotten his coffee and cake and was<br />\nenjoying them while reading the<br />\npaper. Again I found myself in<br />\nfront of the blond youth, and<br />\nI could have strangled him as he<br />\nbarely even glanced at my birth<br />\ncertificate. But after ten<br />\nminutes I was the proud<br />\npossessor of a matriculation<br />\nnumber as a guest student at the<br />\nUniversity of Vienna. I existed;<br />\nI was #8403901.<br />\nLater in the year I began to<br />\nformulate a theory on how<br />\nVienna functions, and my experience with the bureaucracy<br />\nat the University contributed to<br />\none part of this theory. On one<br />\nhand Vienna is a slow-moving<br />\nbureaucracy in which one has<br />\nto stand in ten lines for ten<br />\nhours to accomplish nothing.<br />\nEverything is very lax, and the<br />\n<br />\nrules seem to change according<br />\nto the whim of some administrator. No one knows<br />\nwhat is going on within the<br />\nsame office, and a lot of emphasis is put on lunch, coffee<br />\nand cake. But somehow, if one<br />\ncan stick it out, and not lose<br />\none's documents while traveling<br />\nform one office to the next, one<br />\nlearns to survive and laugh the<br />\nwhole thing off. Some peopled<br />\neven begin to consider it charming, but I have not reached<br />\nthis stage of immunity yet.<br />\nThen on the other hard is the<br />\nprocess of buying a \"standing<br />\nplace\" at the Vienna State<br />\nOpera. Most theaters in Vienna provide standing places for<br />\n$1.00, and they are quite worthwhile as Vienna has a lot to<br />\noffer in the way of theater.<br />\nStanding through an entire<br />\nopera is an experience in itself,<br />\nbut - acquiring that standing<br />\nplace ticket is perhaps even<br />\nmore enlightening. The \"Magic<br />\nFlute\" started at 8:00 p.m.<br />\nwhich means that I had to be at<br />\nthe opera by 5:30. At about<br />\n5:20 I found myself on yet<br />\nanother line, and 1 began to<br />\nfear the worst. I stepped to the<br />\nside to see how long the line<br />\nwas, and a guard in a brown<br />\nuniform immediately barked,<br />\n<br />\n\u201cGe,back in line or you'll lose<br />\nYour llace. One behind the<br />\nother!' When the box office<br />\nopened it 6:00, we marched<br />\nunder tilt stern eyes of about<br />\nfour unit)rmed guards and<br />\npurchased 'he tickets. With<br />\nticket in hant I ran to the next<br />\nroom where I igain stood in a<br />\nline kept in order by three burly men in unifoun. Not one<br />\nmovement out ol line was<br />\ntolerated. I decided that if<br />\nwomen were ever draft.c1 in the<br />\nU.S. I would say that I had<br />\nalready done my military duty<br />\nat the Vienna State Opera.<br />\nFinally at about 7:00 we wele<br />\nallowed to storm the standing<br />\nplace area to claim a spot worth<br />\nguarding one's life .<br />\nI concluded that Vienna<br />\noperates on a system of both<br />\nextreme efficiency and inefficiency, and somehow one must<br />\neither have the presence of<br />\nmind to accept the situation, or<br />\nfind solace in the many cafes<br />\nthat have made Vienna famous.<br />\nThe fame of these cafes is<br />\nperfectly justified, and I was<br />\nlucky to live in Vienna's eighth<br />\ndistrict in which there are many<br />\nstudents, and therefore, many<br />\ncafes, bars and restaurants.<br />\nThere are various Viennese<br />\ncafes that can be called typical.<br />\n<br />\nCafe Hummel,for example, is<br />\na huge, run-down, smoke-filled<br />\nbut extremely pleasant place to<br />\nsit for hours over a cup of<br />\nstrong coffee and a newspaper.<br />\nOr one can spend hours with<br />\na group of people drinking a<br />\ngood wine or beer.<br />\nRight now Austria might be<br />\nhaving problems with its wine,<br />\nbut I personally encountered<br />\nproblems with its hard liquor.<br />\nThe first time I went to a cafe<br />\nin the evening I ordered a gin<br />\nand tonic, expecting exactly<br />\nthat. Instead the waiter brought<br />\nme tonic and gin as the glass<br />\nwas filled with roughly one percent gin and ninety-nine percent<br />\ntonic.

Not only was<br />\nthe wine homemade, but<br />\neverything on the menu was<br />\nhomemade as well.

Rosh<br />\nHashanah, the Jewish new<br />\nyear, was celebrated from last<br />\nSunday, September 15, to Tuesday, September 17. A period of<br />\ncontemplation follows this new<br />\nyear, and culminates in Yom<br />\nKippur, the Day of Atonement.<br />\nDuring the Yom Kippur, one<br />\nreflects on his relationship with<br />\nman and God in the previous<br />\nyear. On the final day one asks<br />\nfor forgiveness from his fellow<br />\nmen and from God. Yom Kippur begins at sundown on Tuesday, September 24, and ends at<br />\nsundown on Wednesday,<br />\nSeptember 25.<br />\nIt is a time spent fasting and<br />\npraying in a synagogue to show<br />\nthat one's mind is on God. A<br />\nShofar or ram's horn is blown<br />\nby the rabbi or designated<br />\nleader during the services. The<br />\nShofar is a symbol of freedom<br />\nand blowing it represents the<br />\nopening of man's mind and<br />\nheart. It is a signal for the corning year and a time to make<br />\n<br />\nlove skiing. I was not convinced, but there was no gettNg out<br />\nof the predicament.<br />\nI could not find a feasible excuse not to go skiing by morn.<br />\ning, so at about 9:00 am I was<br />\nstanding on skis waiting on line<br />\nfor the first chair lift. I had<br />\nskiied once before in my life,<br />\nnine years earlier, but I had<br />\nnever been on a lift. I managed<br />\nto survive the chair lift, and I<br />\nalmost started to have fun and<br />\ngain confidence in my athletic<br />\nabilities. But then I encountered<br />\na contraption known as the TBar. Nobody told me how it<br />\nworks, so I tried what seemed<br />\nreasonable; I tried to sit on the<br />\nthing. That proved rather<br />\ndisastrous as I fell flat on my<br />\nface, almost broke my glasses,<br />\nand held up a line of annoyed<br />\nand screaming skiiers for a<br />\nminute or so. Finally, the ski instructor, a strong young<br />\nAustrian fellow, showed me<br />\nwhat to do, and there I was on<br />\nthe top of what seemed like the<br />\nbiggest mountain in the world.<br />\nMy basic problem was one of<br />\nattitude; I was simply not<br />\nprepared for the ordeal and I<br />\ndid not want to ski. If I had<br />\nwanted to learn I would have<br />\napproached the whole thing differently. But thanks to the<br />\nmoral support of my friends,<br />\nthe ability of the ski instructor<br />\nto ski with me hanging on to<br />\nhim and the restaurants on the<br />\nslopes that kept me filled with<br />\nbeer, wine and brandy, I survived. After that my friends<br />\n\"allowed\" me to hike in the<br />\nmountains, which I did with<br />\ngreat pleasure. The next few<br />\ndays in those mountains proved to be four of the best days<br />\nof the entire year.<br />\nOne of the high points of my<br />\ntravels was a fascinating trip to<br />\nSlovenia, one of the republics<br />\nof Yugoslavia. Another good<br />\nfriend from my dorm came<br />\nfrom the city Ljublana, and I<br />\nwent home with her for six days<br />\nin April. After World War I<br />\nYugoslavia was established,<br />\nand it consists of six republics:<br />\nSlovenia, Serbia, Kroatia,<br />\nMacedonia,<br />\nBosniaHercegovinia and Montenegro.<br />\nThe people of these republics<br />\nare of different nationalities,<br />\nspeak different languages and<br />\n<br />\npossess different cultural<br />\nbackgrounds. This puts the nation in a fairly precarious<br />\npredicament as far as national<br />\nunity is concerned. As my<br />\nfriend's brother pointed out,<br />\nsocialism is not Yugoslavia's<br />\nmain problem; its problems<br />\narise from trying to govern a<br />\nnation that consists of may<br />\ncultures. It is quite evident, at<br />\nleast in Slovenia, that the<br />\nvarious peoples are highly nationalistic, and my friend considers herself Slovenian first,<br />\nYugoslavian second.<br />\nLjublana, the capital of<br />\nSlovenia, is another beautiful<br />\nand charming city that continues in the baroque style of<br />\nthe Austrian Empire. I suppose, however, that the system<br />\ndoes have its effect on the city<br />\nas many of the old buildings are<br />\nin a serious need of renovation.<br />\nThe surrounding countryside<br />\nof Slovenia, however, proved<br />\nto be most interesting for me.<br />\nOf all the sites including a cave,<br />\nsmall villages on the Adriatic<br />\nSea, the remains of a medieval<br />\ncity, I was almost fascinated by<br />\na hospital which bears little<br />\nresemblance to our own Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital. This particular hospital was built secretly in 1940 by the Slovenian partisans right in the middle of a<br />\nmountain cleft. This site was<br />\nchosen in order to keep the<br />\nfacility safe from the Germans,<br />\nand it treated about 262 patients (one of whom was<br />\nAmerican) with then-modern<br />\nmedical techniques until the end<br />\nof the war.<br />\nAs you have probably<br />\nfigured out by now I had a fantastic year, and I implore those<br />\nof you who can to spend at least<br />\na year studying abroad. In this<br />\narticle I have barely begun to<br />\nscratch the surface of my experiences, about which I can<br />\ntalk endlessly; just ask my<br />\nfamily and friends. I hope I<br />\nhave provided a flavor for what<br />\na year abroad can offer in the<br />\nhope that you too will take advantage of a study-abroad option.

The lavish praise this film<br />\nseems to be collecting wherever<br />\nit goes is by no means<br />\nundeserved.<br />\nWilliam Hurt won the Best<br />\nActor award at Cannes for his<br />\nmagnificent portrayal of Luis<br />\nMolina, a homosexual who<br />\nstrongly believes that he is a<br />\nwoman trapped in a man's<br />\nbody. Molina is serving a<br />\nsentence in prison for child<br />\nmolestation; in order to pass<br />\nthe time until he is paroled,<br />\nMolina busies himself by \"telling movies\" to his cell mate<br />\nValentin Arregui (Raul Julia).<br />\nWhile Hurt's \"movies\" start<br />\nout as little more than an annoyance to Julia, they eventually become a major focus of<br />\n<br />\ntheir relationship, as Julia will Hurt into the course of the<br />\nprogress from a bored attitude main film. What eould have<br />\nabout Hurt's stories to actual- been clumsy jumps from the<br />\nly asking Hurt to continue propaganda film to \"reality\"<br />\nwhere he left off last.<br />\nand back again are remarkably<br />\nThe movie which Hurt smooth. And the overacted,<br />\nspends most of his time recoun- cliched propaganda film itself<br />\nting is a Nazi propaganda film. serves to add a bit of humor to<br />\nHurt, seemingly oblivious to the bleak prison lives these two<br />\nthe politics involved in the men come to share.<br />\nmovie, finds the tale of the GerKiss of the Spider Woman<br />\nman SS officer and the does have a plot though, which<br />\nbeautiful French singer (Sonia goes beyond Hurt simply telling<br />\nBraga) who was smart enough movies and Julia simply listennot to be duped by the ing. The movie is about two<br />\nresistance to be a beautiful love radically different people who<br />\nstory. Julia, on the other hand, dramatically change each<br />\nas an ever-serious political other's lives until the pair are<br />\nprisoner, is stupified by this not so different after all. But<br />\nhomosexual who can sym- while the changes each<br />\npathize with the Naxis, a group character goes through are<br />\nwho made a point of destroy- great, they are by no means<br />\ning homosexuals throughout sudden. Director Babenco with<br />\nthe course of World War II.<br />\nscreenwriter Leonard Schrader<br />\nDirector Hector Babenco has make these major changes in<br />\ndisplayed the perfect touch with action and attitude gradual and<br />\nthe insertion of the movie graceful so while the Luis<br />\nwithin a movie being \"told\" by Molina and Valentin Arregui<br />\n<br />\nwho close the film are considerably different from the<br />\nLuis and Valentin who open it.<br />\nIt is difficult to find the one turning point where a character's<br />\nchanges might have occurred.<br />\nThe actual twists in plot only<br />\nserve to illustrate these changes<br />\nin character, as we find Luis or<br />\nValentin in situations we can be<br />\nsure they would not have been<br />\nfound in before the film's start.<br />\nThe sincerity of Hurt's many<br />\nkindnesses towards Julia is<br />\nbrought into question when it<br />\nseems<br />\nHurt<br />\nis<br />\nbeing<br />\nmanipulated by the warden into weaseling information from<br />\nhis cell mate. But it soon<br />\nbecomes obvious where Hurt's<br />\nloyalties lay, most notably in<br />\nmoving scenes such as where<br />\nHurt sympathetically mothers<br />\nJulia after the latter has a<br />\npoison-induced accident in his<br />\npants. A scene like this, as well<br />\nas the scenes which follow that<br />\nshow Hurt nursing Julia back<br />\n<br />\nto health, show just how far<br />\nthis virtually male/female relationship has come during the<br />\ncourse of the film.<br />\nWhile the plotline itself is<br />\nfine (although revealing in<br />\ndetail here would serve to ruin<br />\nthe movie), it is the characters<br />\nthat really make this film the<br />\nsuccess it is. Julia is excellent as<br />\nthe political prisoner who tries<br />\nto be a stoic unit! Hurt brings<br />\nout a new side of him; Hurt's<br />\nincredible job as a soft, pretty<br />\nwoman in a male shell, whose<br />\nlife Julia gives a sense of purpose,<br />\ncannot<br />\nbe<br />\noveremphasized.<br />\nThe movies within the movie,<br />\nthe flashbacks, and the dream<br />\nsequence used by the director<br />\nserve to set this film apart structurally from most other films of<br />\nrecent memory. This, plus the<br />\nquality of acting and<br />\nfascinating character development makes Kiss of the Spider<br />\nWoman essential movie fare.<br />\n<br />\nFive Star, Shy, Mr. Mister: Don't Volunteer<br />\nDescent into the Mainstream<br />\nby Steve Brett<br />\n<br />\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\nA strange thing happened to<br />\nme over the summer\u2014I started<br />\nrunning out of things to cornplain about. There was TV I<br />\nwanted to watch, I enjoyed the<br />\nmovies I saw; hell the deans<br />\neven reduced my rent. Most<br />\namazing (and disconcerting),<br />\nthough, was the fact that there<br />\nwere, for the first time in a<br />\nwhile, good pop songs on the<br />\nradio\u2014Top 40-AM radio, no<br />\nless. Sting, the Eurythmics,<br />\nKatrina and the Waves\u2014all<br />\ngood stuff; I didn't even mind<br />\nRaspberry Beret that much I<br />\nwas<br />\ngetting<br />\nseriously<br />\nconcerned\u2014were things really<br />\nso good or was I going going. . . Mainstream?!<br />\nImagine my relief then, when<br />\nI dropped by the News-Letter<br />\noffice at the end of the summer<br />\nand found a stack of undistinguished RCA records just<br />\nasking for abuse. All of them<br />\ntrying to capitalize on the latest<br />\nfad, all of them worthless excercises in uncreative corporate<br />\ngreed, or so I thought... Truth<br />\nis, the albums I've listened to so<br />\nfar haven't even been that ternble. Not extremely good<br />\nperhaps, but certainly,<br />\ntolerable. Damn. So just to<br />\nprove to myself that my tastes<br />\nhaven't regressed completely,<br />\nI've reviewed a couple of<br />\nalbums of my own choosing<br />\nwhich are decidedly less<br />\nmainstream.<br />\nFive Star: Luxury of Life<br />\nOf all the RCA albums, this<br />\none had the most potential to<br />\nbe truly exploitative: They're<br />\nblack, they're all in the same<br />\nfamily, and there just happens<br />\nto be five of them. Sound<br />\nfamiliar? Add to that the fact<br />\nthat the young boy in the band<br />\nlooks a lot like a young Micheal<br />\nand the older looks a lot like the<br />\nolder Micheal and well...there<br />\nyou have it. It turns out,<br />\nthough, that Five Star is already<br />\nquite popular in England. And<br />\n<br />\nit appears as if soon they're going to have some American success too. They're at their best<br />\nwhen they play a gentle funk<br />\nevocative of New Edition, as on<br />\n\"Love Take Over\" and<br />\n\"Let Me Be the One,\" but<br />\nthey're<br />\n.at<br />\ntheir<br />\nold synth-pop cliches\u2014the<br />\nballady \"Say Goodbye\" or the<br />\nrobotics of \"System Addict.\"<br />\nin all, however, not a bad<br />\neffort.<br />\nMr. Mister: Welcome to the<br />\nReal World. A hard-working<br />\nsynth-band? Actually, the synthesizer having infiltrated even<br />\nthe works of Mr. Springsteen,<br />\n\"synth-band\" has little meaning anymore. Even so, this<br />\nband is a great example of just<br />\nhciw entrenched the synth has<br />\nbecome in modern pop. This<br />\nalbum is all rather pleasant, the<br />\nsynth having filled in all the<br />\nspaces and leaving it with a<br />\nrather fluffy consistency. Truly an album to fall asleep<br />\nto...My goodness, the lyrics,<br />\nthough: \"Time it passes much<br />\ntoo fast/and time I want to<br />\nmake it last.\" Halfway through<br />\nI suffered a banality attack.<br />\nShy: Brave the Storm. Admittedly the worst of the bunch but<br />\nstill better than the heavy-metal<br />\nartwork would imply. They<br />\nsound more like Styx or REO<br />\nSpeedwagon than Judas Priest.<br />\nThey use synthesizers, too. And<br />\nthe lead singer can sing real<br />\nhigh.<br />\nRock and Roll\u2014The Early<br />\nDays. The soundtrack to an upcoming video cassette and one<br />\nof the best oldies compilations<br />\nto date. \"Rock Around the<br />\nClock,\" \"Blue Suede Shoes,\"<br />\n\"Bo Didley,\" \"Tutti Frutti,\"<br />\n\"Great Balls of Fire,\" all by those<br />\nthat made them famous<br />\nplus \"Hound Dog\" done by Big<br />\nMama Thornton (which makes<br />\na hell of a lot more sense when<br />\nsung by a woman)and more. If<br />\nyou're not sick of all these<br />\nsongs and don't own any of<br />\n<br />\nthese, this is a good place to get<br />\nthem. A worthwhile release if<br />\njust to get all the oldie hits onto one album.<br />\nMission of Burma: The<br />\nHorrible Truth About Burma.<br />\n(Ace of Hearts) The last possiL.t. \u2014tp.nce hy Mission of Burma,<br />\nma, arguabl one_ of the<br />\ngreatest American bands of the<br />\nlast decade. This is a compilation of live recordings made all<br />\nover the country during their<br />\nfinal tour a couple of years ago.<br />\nUnlike most live albums,<br />\nthough, all the songs here are<br />\npreviously unrecorded by<br />\nM.O.B. so this is equivalent to<br />\na brand new album. The live<br />\nformat doesn't hurt the album<br />\nin the least since the success of<br />\nMission of Burma always lied<br />\nin their sheer intensity and not<br />\nin their clarity. As with a lot of<br />\npost-punk this is perhaps not<br />\nvery accessible but once you're<br />\ninvolved it's emotionally overwhelming. In addition to the<br />\nthrobbing originals, they cover<br />\nthe Stooges (1970) and Pere<br />\nUbu (Heart of Darkness).<br />\nVolcano Suns:The Bright<br />\nOrange Years (Homestead)<br />\nThis band has been hailed, \"the<br />\nnext Husker Du.\" I always<br />\nthought, though, that Husker<br />\nDu owed alot to Mission of<br />\nBurma and indeed, the leader<br />\nof the Volcano Suns is none<br />\nother than Peter Prescott, the<br />\n-drummer of Mission of Burma.<br />\nLike Husker Du, they play a<br />\nkind of \"Folk Hardcore\" but<br />\nunlike that band its \"folk\" is<br />\nnot in the music but in the<br />\nlyrics. Prescott, who wrote<br />\nmost of the songs on the album,<br />\nmust have grown up on a<br />\nfarm\u2014songs likeCornfield,<br />\nAnimals,andlt's Stewtime bear<br />\nthis out. The rustic themes added to the post-punk throb of<br />\nPrescott (i.e. Mission of Burma) make this and extremely<br />\noriginal album. I doubt<br />\nanything like this has ever been<br />\ndone before.<br />\n<br />\nIf you believe that Splash! is<br />\na terrifically funny movie, that<br />\nStar Trek II: The Wrath of<br />\nKhan is a highly spirited and<br />\nmost enjoyable adventure film,<br />\nand that M*A *S*H and Cheers<br />\nare two of the highest-quality<br />\nsitcoms in recent memory, let<br />\nme ask you this: How do the<br />\nstars of Splash! plus the director of Star Trek II plus writers<br />\nwho have worked on<br />\nM *A *S*H and Cheers add up<br />\nto a movie as incredibly<br />\nmediocre as Volunteers?<br />\nThis is one equation which<br />\ndoesn't seem to balance.<br />\nAny comedy which carries<br />\nout its prime directive, to make<br />\nthe audience laugh, does not<br />\ndeserve an outright pan (provided the audience laughs with<br />\nthe movie and not at it).<br />\nVolunteers does have a number<br />\nof genuine laughs to its credit,<br />\nbut anyone who has seen the<br />\ntrailer for this film (about five<br />\nminutes of true hilarity) has<br />\nbeen exposed to nearly all the<br />\nlaughs they can expect the actual movie to deliver.<br />\nTom Hanks, hilarious in<br />\nSplash!, plays the playboy, sonof-a-millionaire, Yale senior<br />\nLawrence Bourne III. On<br />\ngraduation day, Hanks drops<br />\n$28,000 in one bet on the outcome of the basketball championship, and Lawrence<br />\nBourne, Jr.(George Plimpton)<br />\ndecides paying sonny's debt will<br />\ndo nothing to build Larry Ill's<br />\ncharacter. Without his father's<br />\nhelp, Hanks knows the only<br />\nway to keep the debt from being settled in blood would be to<br />\nhop on the first flight out of<br />\nthese United States. That flight<br />\nhappens to be to Thailand, and<br />\nstepping on board officially<br />\nenlists Hanks in the Peace<br />\nCorps.<br />\nOn the plane Hanks meets up<br />\nwith John Candy as Tom Tuttle from Tacoma. So funny as<br />\nHank's brother Freddy in<br />\nSplash!,<br />\nthe<br />\nriotous<br />\nHanks/Candy interplay from<br />\n<br />\nthat film simply isn't repeated<br />\nhere. The duo's exchanges in<br />\nVolunteers display none of the<br />\nchemistry which seemed to exist in the Ron Howard film. Be<br />\nthat as it may, the plane still<br />\npersists in heading to Thailand<br />\nwhere Hanks, Candy and Rita<br />\nWilson (playing Long IslandJAP Beth Wexler)are sent to a<br />\nsmall village with instructions<br />\nto construct a bridge across a<br />\nnearby river.<br />\nAnd when does all this take<br />\nplace? 1962, but you wouldn't<br />\nknow it. The series of black and<br />\nwhite film clips of sixties<br />\nluminaries and events does not<br />\nset the tone as director Nicholas<br />\nMeyer must have thought it<br />\nwould. Minor details, such as<br />\nWilson reading Profiles in<br />\nCourage or having the flight<br />\nleaving from Idlewilde Airport<br />\n(Kennedy Airport's original<br />\nname) just don't cut it. And<br />\nhaving the basketball championship where Hanks loses his<br />\nshirt being Lakers versus<br />\nCeltics, a match still fresh in the<br />\nmind of current sports fans, only adds to the 60s-80s confusion<br />\nthe film provides. Styles, attitudes, an anachronism or two<br />\nand even the film's antiidealistic moral all seem to<br />\nplace the film in an 80s frame<br />\nof reference.<br />\nWhen Hanks, Candy and<br />\nWilson arrive in the village to<br />\nbuild the bridge, complications<br />\ndevelop. The villagers don't<br />\nwant the bridge, but everyone<br />\nelse does: Red Chinese are<br />\nwaiting to cross it and take over<br />\nthe village, and an opium smuggler wants to cross it to gain access to the poppies which lie on<br />\nthe other side. Even the CIA<br />\nhas a vested interest in this feat<br />\nof civil engineering. Unfortunately, the complications just<br />\ndo not get complicated enough,<br />\nnot taking the twists and turns<br />\nnecessary to maintain any tension.

But<br />\nHanks remedies both of these<br />\nProblems with the greatest of<br />\nease, reducing what could have<br />\nbeen major developments to<br />\nmere annoyances easily set<br />\nright.<br />\nAnother flaw in this film lies<br />\nin its direction. Nicholas Meyer<br />\nseemed unable to decide<br />\nWhether to make this film a<br />\nPlausible comedy (with plausible or near-plausible situations<br />\nmade funny by humorous<br />\ndialogue or actions) or to make<br />\nthis an Airplane-style comedy,<br />\nWherein the majority of jokes<br />\nare funny because of how imPossible or ridiculous they<br />\nwould be in real life. Meyer's<br />\nmistake was to employ both<br />\nStyles of comedy here, and it<br />\ndoesn't work. For example,<br />\nJust as we are convinced that a<br />\ncertain scenario could occur in<br />\nreality, the characters will do<br />\nsomething such as read the subtitles from the bottom of the<br />\nscreen.<br />\nThe film's conclusion is most<br />\nunsatisfying, and downright<br />\n\u2022 surprising in view of the fact<br />\nthat Volunteers' director also<br />\ndirected TV's politically leftoriented The Day After. Rather<br />\nthan having Hanks' unsympathetic playboy attitude<br />\nchanged in light of his Peace<br />\nCorps experiences, it is Hanks'<br />\nattitude which finally corrupts<br />\neverybody else, from his once<br />\nIdealistic Peace Corps comrades<br />\n<br />\ndown to the once innocent Thai<br />\nvillagers. If Meyer was so intent<br />\non having this film take place<br />\nin 1962, the least he could have<br />\ndone would be to have the con-<br />\n<br />\nclusion fit in with the preKennedy assasination Camelot<br />\nstatcof mind rather than with<br />\nthe corrupt hedonism of<br />\nAmerica today.<br />\n<br />\nSt. Paul Cleaners<br />\n<br />\n3120 St.<br />\nPaul St.<br />\n235-4413<br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAYCLEANING<br />\nAND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRAIG<br />\n<br />\nPICK-UP & DELIVERY NOW AVAILABLE ON<br />\nOR NEAR CAMPUS<br />\nScSoSuWin SAM *********incoming<br />\n:\u2022\u2022\u2022Win *<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n07.a.<br />\n4r\u2022181f*as\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1007o discount-on all dry cleaning. i<br />\n<br />\ne xers1JP4J4041*******\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022:<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nArthur S.

By Marguerite<br />\nDuras, Pantheon Books,<br />\n$11.95. 117 pp.<br />\nThe Lover is a gem of a<br />\nbook. Small, simple, and highly<br />\npolished, it succeeds at catching<br />\nlight and giving a new elegance<br />\nto autobiography, blending it<br />\nsmoothly with fiction until the<br />\ndifferences don't matter<br />\nanymore.<br />\nThis is a foreign novel. Its<br />\nauthor, Marguerite Duras, is<br />\none of France's oldest and most<br />\ncelebrated authors, but remains<br />\nrelatively unknown by this<br />\ncountry's popular reading audience. In The Lover, the<br />\nFrench feeling is everywhere;<br />\nthe dreamlike, present-tense<br />\nwriting, and the strong erotic<br />\nimagery. It seems to effortlessly avoid the crude explicitness<br />\nwhich dominates modern fiction, yet is highly charged. The<br />\nbook is romantic in the best<br />\nsense of the word; it goes<br />\nbeyond the couple to all the<br />\npeople around them, their surroundings, their world.<br />\nThe story's narrator is a<br />\n15-year-old French girl whose<br />\nwidowed mother has settled in<br />\nCambodia. The mother is a<br />\nstrange, shabbily-dressed<br />\nschool headmistress going<br />\nsenile, her brothers are itinerant<br />\ngood-for-nothings; the younger<br />\none loves Duras but is weak,<br />\nthe other delights in hearing her<br />\nbeaten. These Europeans living<br />\noff the graces of Southeast Asia<br />\nhave nothing glamourous about<br />\n<br />\nthem. There is no Jewel-in-theCrown colonialism, no sense of<br />\ngrandeur.<br />\nThe girl's family has lost its<br />\nmoney and lives in squalid<br />\ndecay. While the family still has<br />\nan unpaid houseboy, it is \"garbage\" he serves them\u2014\"storks,<br />\nbaby crocodiles.\" The heroine<br />\ndresses in silken rags, gold lame<br />\nevening shoes and a man's<br />\nfedora, desperate to be different and make something<br />\nbeautiful out of the chaos.<br />\nDuring the school year, the<br />\nheroine sleeps at a state-run<br />\nboarding school and attends<br />\nclasses at her mother's French<br />\nhigh school. As one of two<br />\nwhite pupils at the boarding<br />\nschool, she is allowed complete<br />\nfreedom to come and go at<br />\nnight. She does this with daily<br />\nfrequency once she accepts a<br />\nride from \"the lover,\" who remains nameless throughout the<br />\nwhole book.<br />\nThey meet symbolically, as<br />\nthe girl is crossing the water<br />\nfrom her mother's shack to the<br />\nschool in Saigon. There is a<br />\nriver of difference separating<br />\nthe Asians from the whites\u2014a<br />\nvastness far too horrifying for<br />\neither society to even talk<br />\nabout.<br />\nThe lover is close to thirty,<br />\nChinese, Paris-educated, and<br />\nwealthy. He lounges beside his<br />\nchauffered black limousine<br />\nwatching the girl for days. She<br />\ninitially takes a ride with him<br />\nfor his wealth, and tells him this<br />\nquite candidly after their first<br />\nlove-making session. This hardness, this lack of sentimentali-<br />\n<br />\nty and feeling makes him mad<br />\nfor her. And she falls in love<br />\nwith the feel, the aura of<br />\npassion.<br />\nThere are long, hot afternoons in his apartment in<br />\nSaigon. There are longer, stultifying evenings when he takes<br />\nher family to elegant Chinese<br />\nrestaurants and nightclubs.<br />\nThey do not speak to him; they<br />\ncannot comprehend his stature<br />\nas a person, let alone the<br />\ndaughter's lover. Yet they eat<br />\nhis food and drink his wine,<br />\nlater beating the girl who cries<br />\nover and over that they are not<br />\nlovers, they are just friends.<br />\nThis issue of racism is handled gracefully by the author.<br />\nWhile Duras' family considers<br />\nthe lover a horrifying disgrace,<br />\npoverty binds them to him.<br />\nWhile the girl's whiteness gives<br />\nher power over the lover, he can<br />\nnever marry her. To the lover's<br />\npowerful, landowner father,<br />\nDuras is just \"the little white<br />\nwhore from Sadec.\" In the end<br />\nit is Duras, the object of desire,<br />\nwho is the true pariah. Rejected<br />\nby her .schoolfriends, family,<br />\nthe Chinese and Cambodians,<br />\nshe addresses a bleak destiny<br />\nalone.<br />\nrun<br />\nhigh<br />\nEmotions<br />\nthroughout the story, yet never<br />\nverge on melodrama. Duras'<br />\nclipped, elegant prose augments<br />\nthe lush setting instead of overwhelming with \"exotic\"<br />\ndetails. Simple language sweeps<br />\nthe reader into a dream-like<br />\nstate.

The aim of<br />\nthese. studies is to determine<br />\nwhat types of behavior occur<br />\nfollowing the diagnosis of<br />\ncancer, and what types of<br />\npsychiatric interventions may<br />\nbe necessary to deal with these<br />\nbehaviors. Zabora is also the<br />\ndirector of the Joanne<br />\nRockwell Memorial house, a<br />\ntemporary residential facility<br />\nfor families of cancer patients<br />\nwho are undergoing treatment<br />\nat Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nZabora's work began about<br />\ntwo years ago when he began to<br />\nlook at the wide variety of patients' responses to the<br />\ndiagnosis of cancer.

Doctors<br />\nand nurses were asked, without<br />\nknowledge of the FACES<br />\nscores, to identify which<br />\nfamilies displayed at least one<br />\nof six certain behaviors which<br />\ntend to indicate stress. These<br />\nbehaviors include interfering<br />\nwith medical treatment, noncompliance, or complete<br />\navoidance of the patient and<br />\nthe entire situation. These<br />\nbehaviors were found to exist in<br />\nabout one-third of the families.<br />\nThe FACES was shown to<br />\npredict 86% of the time which<br />\nfamilies would or would not exhibit any of these behaviors.<br />\nZabora encountered a problem, however, when he began<br />\na prospective study in March of<br />\n1983.

Let's<br />\nhope no planes are flying low<br />\nnear Homewood tomorrow.<br />\nClearly, tomorrow's game<br />\nwill be a challenge for the Blue<br />\nJay's defensive unit, specifically the defensive backs. Both<br />\nhead coach Jerry Pfeifer and<br />\ndefensive coordinator Bob<br />\nBabb agree that Swarthmore is<br />\nan explosive team.

Randolph-Macon was<br />\nnot able to run on Swarthmore,<br />\nbut was effective in throwing<br />\nthe football. That is godd news<br />\nto quarterback Mark Campbell<br />\nand the Blue Jay's receiving<br />\ncorp.<br />\n\"Last year, we ran the ball<br />\nwell against them,\" said<br />\nPfiefer. \"Hopefully, the run<br />\nand the pass will set up each<br />\nother but we must prevent them<br />\nfrom controlling the line of<br />\nsrimmage.\"<br />\nPfiefer says this year's squad<br />\nhas the strongest running corps<br />\never at Hopkins.

According to Lucien Brush, former<br />\ndean of arts and sciences and<br />\nRegistrar Robert Cyphers, open<br />\nperiod, which used to last one<br />\nweek, has been shortened by<br />\ntwo days in order to compensate for the late start, while still<br />\nallowing for enough time between the end of exam week and<br />\ncommencement.<br />\n\"Intersession was the major<br />\ndriving force in changing the<br />\nstarting date of second<br />\nsemester,\" said Cyphers.

This suggestion was adopted as policy with<br />\nthe beginning of the 1985 fall<br />\nterm. This change, however,<br />\ndoes not affect those students<br />\ncurrently enrolled in the major.<br />\nThe committee that studied<br />\nthe Natural Science Area Major was composed of Lloyd<br />\nArmstrong, Maurice Bessman,<br />\nHans Eugster, David Olton,<br />\nDouglas Poland (chairman),<br />\nand Martha Roseman. They<br />\nreviewed the present status of<br />\nthe area major and compared it<br />\nto other standard science<br />\nmajors.<br />\nIn the past, according to<br />\ntheir report, the requirements<br />\nfor the major were: 40 (N)<br />\ncredits (including chemistry and<br />\nlab, physics,and lab, and 15<br />\ncredits beyond the 300 level), 36<br />\n(H), (Q), or (S) credits, and<br />\nother unspecified courses to obtain a total of 120 credits. A<br />\nNatural Science Area Major is<br />\noften adopted by pre-meds,<br /><br />\nsays the report, because it permits them to fullfill all their<br />\npre-med requirements (inorganic and organic chemistry,<br />\ntheir respective labs, MCB and<br />\nlab, physics and lab\u201e and<br />\ncalculus.) Almost half(43 percent) of the students graduating<br />\nin the natural sciences receive<br />\ntheir Baccalaureate degree in<br />\nthe Natural Science Area Major.<br />\nThe report concluded that<br />\nthe Natural Science Area Major lacks depth, consisting of<br />\nlarge, introductory classes with<br />\nonly one required 300 level<br />\ncourse. The report characterized the major as a minimal<br />\n\"Pre-med Major\" for a larger<br />\nnumber of undergraduates.<br />\nHowever, the committee did<br />\nnot wish to abandon the major<br />\nfor two reasons. First, by forcing all students presently enrolled in the area major to adopt<br />\na more traditional science, the<br />\nsmall, highly specialized,<br />\nupper-level science laboratories<br />\nwould be swamped by the flux<br />\nof new students. Secondly,<br />\neliminating the major would<br />\nnot afford students the opportunity and flexibility to construct a program that spans two<br />\ntraditional fields.<br /><br />\nLater Shuttle<br />\nPlanned for<br />\nExcursions<br />\nto Peabody<br />\nby Jay Lechtman and<br />\naathy Wu<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nMatthew Crenson, associate dean of arts and sciences.<br /><br />\nFrom the recommendations<br />\nof the committee, the new<br />\npolicy regarding the major includes: a new name\u2014the<br />\nNatural Science major, organic<br />\nchemistry and lab and biology<br />\nand lab (if pre-med) or 20<br />\ncredits of introductory or<br />\nupper-level science and<br />\nmathematics (if not premed)in<br />\naddition to chemistry and lab,<br />\nphysics and lab, and one year<br />\nof calculus.<br />\nAlso, five one-semester<br />\ncourses at the 300 level or higher,<br />\ntotaling at least 15 credits, 30<br />\n(H)and (S)credits, one year of<br />\nan elementary college-level<br /><br />\nmodern language, and an<br />\noverall grade point average of<br />\nat least 2.0 are additional<br />\nrequirements.<br />\nApart from the change in<br />\ncurriculum requirements, each<br />\nscience department assigns a<br />\nfaculty advisor to oversee the<br />\nprograms of those Natural<br />\nScience Area Majors concentrating their studies within that<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nIn regard to the other two<br />\ncommittees, Crenson says that<br />\ndeliberations concerning the<br />\nHumanities and the Social and<br />\nBehavioral Science Area majors<br />\nwill continue.<br /><br />\nScholarship Info<br />\nThe National Science<br />\nFoundation is awarding<br />\nthree-year<br />\ngraduate<br />\nfellowhips in science and<br />\nengineering for students who<br />\nare at or near the beginning<br />\nof their graduate study.<br />\nFellowships are awarded<br />\nin the mathematical,<br />\nbiological,<br />\nphysical,<br />\nengineering, and social<br />\nsciences and in the history<br />\nand philosophy of science.<br />\nThe stipend is $11,100 for<br />\na twelve-month tenure.

Meets the West<br />\nFor a Day?<br /><br />\nThe<br /><br />\nby Scott Proestel<br /><br />\nTwo things need to be said about the<br />\nnew Fall Break. The first is that it is<br />\nessentially meaningless. The second is<br />\nthat it represents a major accomplishment for students.<br />\nThe break is more or less unimportant<br />\nin that one day is hardly going to make<br />\na dramatic difference in anyone's life. It<br />\ncertainly will be nice, and even that one<br />\nday will relieve some of the infamous<br />\nfall-semester pressure; however, it will<br />\nmost emphatically not change the way<br />\nstudents view the term. The fall will still<br />\nrepresent one long, monotonous block<br />\nof classes.<br />\nWhat is much more important is that,<br />\nentirely because of student action the<br />\nbreak has been established and<br />\nremarkably quickly.<br />\nIt was only last winter, after all, that<br />\nthe Student Council formed its Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee on Fall Break. After conduc-<br /><br />\nting a survey of Hopkins students and<br />\nof other colleges, the panel began lobbying the administration for such a<br />\nvacation.<br />\nResponding to those efforts, the administration decided to go ahead with a<br />\nfall break, and rearranged the calendar<br />\naccordingly this summer.<br />\nAll of that ought to make any concerned student quite happy. Not only has the<br />\nadministration listened to student concerns, but something far more unusual<br />\nhas happened: Hopkins students have<br />\ngotten off their rumps and taken an active role in improving the university.<br />\nThat just doesn't happen around here.<br />\nSo although the break itself is nothing<br />\nto get too excited about, the way it came<br />\nabout is truly remarkable. Maybe<br />\nstudents will actually start caring what<br />\ngoes on around here.<br /><br />\nOne More Dean<br />\nDeans have been increasing around<br />\nhere the last few years as fast as tuition.<br />\nOnly four years ago, just one year<br />\nbefore the current senior class arrived,<br />\nthere was one dean in charge of<br />\nHomewood. The following year two<br />\ndeans were given joint command. And<br />\nnow a triad of top-ranking people has<br />\nbeen created. Whether a three-headed<br />\nbeast can run with any direction remains<br />\nto be seen.<br />\nIt seems, intuitively, that there must<br />\nbe one man at the top; someone must be<br />\nin charge. University President Steven<br />\nMuller is both unwilling and unable to<br />\nfill that post: unwilling in that he is<br />\nprimarily interested in Hopkins' international aspects; unable in that his energy<br />\nmust be largely devoted to the university's other divisions.<br />\nSo until four years ago, George Owen,<br />\ndean of the Homewood faculties, was<br />\nresponsible for handling campus affairs.<br />\nWhen he retired, control of the campus<br />\nwas turned over to two deans: the Dean<br />\nof the School of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nthe Dean of the G.W.C. Whiting School<br />\nof Engineering. That system lasted a couple years, even when one of the two head<br />\ndeans changed.(Arts and Sciences chief<br />\nSigmund Suskind resigned and was<br />\nreplaced by George Fisher.) Last spring,<br />\nit was announced that a new top-ranking<br />\nposition would be created: the Dean of<br />\nAdministration. Robert Welch, the new<br />\nkid on the block this fall, was hired to<br />\nfill the slot.<br />\nWhen the new position was created,<br />\nit was said a third dean would allow<br />\nFisher and Dean of the G.W.C. School<br />\nof Engineering V. David VandeLinde to<br />\nfocus on academic concerns, while<br />\navoiding administrative hassles.<br />\nBut just how much the new system will<br /><br />\nstreamline administrative decisions is<br />\nunknown. Complaints have been frequent the last two years that no one<br />\nseemed in charge much of the time.<br />\nWhen a decision was needed, the two<br />\ndeans would have to consult, often a<br />\ntime-consuming process.<br />\nWith the addition of yet another dean,<br />\nit seems natural that situation would only<br />\nworsen. Muller argues, however, that the<br />\nresponsibilities of the three deans are sufficiently distinct to avoid a directionless<br />\nmuddle at the top.<br />\nTo at least a certain extent, that may<br />\nbe true. Administrative concerns will<br />\nnow have to be brought before only one<br />\ndean. On those issues at least, that could<br />\nmean a smoother operation.<br />\nBut even on academic issues, where<br />\nFisher and VandeLinde will continue<br />\ntheir joint rule, there may be an advantage to the new structure. As part of<br />\nWelch's hiring, the position of Associate<br />\nDean of Undergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudies was abolished. While some of<br />\nwhat Brush did will fall under Welch's<br />\ncontrol, much will be handled by Fisher<br />\nand VandeLinde's deputies. Brush's<br />\nposition within the administration had<br />\nbecome increasingly unclear, an the<br />\nabolition of what had become, in<br />\nMuller's words, a \"redundant\" position<br />\nshould facilitate quick decisions on<br />\nacademic matters.<br />\nStudents ought to have a healthy skepticism about the new administrative<br />\nstructure. At first glance, it appears to<br />\nworsen an already bad situation. But it<br />\nis also true that it provides an opportunity to improve how Homewood is run.<br />\nOnly the next few months(and the first<br />\nfew crises) will reveal if that opportunity has been seized.<br /><br />\nYou've seen it every<br />\nsummer\u2014for three months out<br />\nof the year, the East Coast<br />\ndresses like the West Coast.<br />\nSummer rolls in, and with it<br />\ncomes the Ocean Pacific Principle. It states that although the<br />\nAtlantic is an ocean also, it<br />\nsomehow doen't quite match<br />\nup to the Pacific. So people in<br />\nthe East dress like they're in<br />\nCalifornia, and pretend that the<br />\nPacific is fifty yards from their<br />\ncondo.<br />\nMany clothes manufacturers<br />\nhave made millions off of this<br />\nsimple principle. Have you ever<br />\nseen Ocean Pacific's spring<br />\nline?(A rhetorical question.) It<br />\nactually looks a great deal like<br />\ntheir winter line. Whether it's<br />\nextra-long green baggies, or<br />\nextra-long pink baggies, their<br />\nOp logo is nearby. But you<br />\ndon't have to take my word for<br />\nit\u2014just look around. The<br />\nextra-large shirts with bright<br />\nlettering or surfers riding blue<br />\nwaves are a sure giveaway.<br />\nI am a capitalist, and I think<br />\nit's great that clothing<br />\nmanufacturers can make<br />\nmoney off of our fantasies. It<br />\ngives me a warm feeling inside<br />\nwhenever I see \"Surf Naked\"<br />\nor \"Life's a Beach\" tee-shirts<br />\nthat a company has churned<br />\nout. It isn't with them that I<br />\nhave a problem. What really<br />\nannoys me is the sunglass craze<br />\nthat tagged along with the<br />\nclothing fad.<br />\nI enjoy looking into people's<br />\neyes. You can understand a lot<br />\nabout a person by searching in<br />\ntheir eyes. You can tell how<br />\ntheir day has been, if something<br /><br />\nis bothering them, or if they feel<br />\nlike going out to eat. However,<br />\nwith the advent of sunglasses,<br />\nthis has all been changed. The<br />\nsilent two-way communication<br />\nhas been destroyed. Trying to<br />\nlook into they eyes of someone<br />\nwearing sunglasses is like looking into a black abyss. Unless<br />\nof course they are wearing mirrored sunglasses\u2014then you get<br />\nto look into your own eyes,<br />\nwhich is stupid because you<br />\nalready know how you feel.<br />\nYou only have to see a girl<br />\nbat her eyes once to realize that<br />\neyes<br />\nare<br />\na<br />\npowerful<br />\naphrodisiac. But yet some people insist on covering up their<br />\neyes with sunglasses anyway.<br />\nBy far the worst offenders are<br />\nmirrored sunglasses. The girl<br />\nthat you wanted to go out with<br />\nyesterday now looks like the<br />\ncockroach you killed last night.<br />\nThere is one advantage to<br />\nwearing sunglasses. You may<br />\nnot want people looking into<br />\nyour eyes and understanding<br />\nhow you feel. This form of<br />\ncommunication may be an annoyance to you. But, if that is<br />\nthe case, you might as well dig<br />\na hole now, and live (and die)<br />\nthere.<br />\nIn conclusion, I believe my<br />\nopinion is best expressed by an<br />\nancient manuscript recently<br />\ndiscovered in Asia:<br />\nCalifornia,<br />\nYour girls may be great,<br />\nAnd your wine may be fine,<br />\nYour baggies are colorful,<br />\nBut are no friends of mine,<br />\nThough there are things<br />\nthe East may lack,<br />\nPlease, CA, please, take<br />\nyour sunglasses back.<br />\n\u2014Kubla Khan<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nMary Ginder<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nT.J.

I also had<br />\nsome friends there, and my<br />\nGerman was pretty good; so<br />\nVienna seemed like the right<br />\nchoice.<br />\nIt turned out to be the perfect<br />\none.<br />\nI arrived in a rainy Vienna on<br />\nSept. 16 with a cold that I had<br />\ncaught back in the States. According to my folder filled with<br />\npapers from the University of<br />\nVienna, class started on Oct. 1,<br />\nand I thought that two weeks<br />\nwould be enough time to<br />\nmatriculate, register and start<br />\nto familiarize myself with Vienna. Instead, it was during this<br />\ntime that I got my first taste of<br />\nViennese bureaucracy.<br />\nActually, it was easier for me<br />\nthan most foreign students<br />\nbecause a colleague of my<br />\nfather's at the University had<br />\nalready taken care of the<br />\npreliminary paper work. So I<br />\nentered the central office of the<br />\nUniversity through \"little door<br />\nnumber six,\" as it is affectionately called, expecting only minor problems if any. I<br />\nlooked for the ofice that deals<br />\nwith foreign students; I did not<br />\nhave to look very far. The line<br />\nextended so far down a long<br />\ncorridor with people chattering<br />\naway in every language except<br />\nGerman that it was impossible<br />\nto confuse the office for<br />\nanything but an immigration<br />\ncenter. I was advised by the<br />\nwise assistant of my father's<br />\ncolleague to return right after<br />\nthe lunch break in the hope of<br />\nfinding a smaller line.<br />\nWhen I returned the line had<br />\nindeed shrunk, and after a mere<br />\n45 minutes I was actually inside<br />\nthe room, and I could see what<br /><br />\nwas going on behind the<br />\ncounter. One young lady was<br />\nbusy doodling on a pad, a<br />\nmiddle-aged man was yelling<br />\nfor coffee and cake, a lady who<br />\nlooked like a witch was giving<br />\nsomeopne a hard time, and a<br />\nblond youth wa slowly, very<br />\nslowly \"processing\" someone.<br />\nFinally, it was my turn to be<br />\nprocessed by him.<br />\n\"Where is your birth<br />\ncertificate?\"<br />\n\"How about my passport?\"<br />\nI replied. \"My birth certificate<br />\nis in the United States because<br />\nI was not informed that I would<br />\nneed it.\"<br />\nSince my passport was not<br />\nadequate proof of my existence, I was told to return<br />\nwhen I could produce my birth<br />\ncertificate. Furthermore, I also<br />\nhad not gone for a physical<br />\nwhich is another requirement<br />\nfor matriculation at the University of Vienna. I called home to<br />\nask my parents to send a copy<br />\nof my birth certificate, and then<br />\nI stood on line for about two<br />\nand a half hours to have an xray taken for tuberculosis. My<br />\nnon-existing self had highly<br />\nphotogenic lungs.<br />\nI returned to the adminstration office a week later with the<br />\nproper documents in hand. The<br />\nyoung lady ws no longer doodling; she was staring into space<br />\nwith a glazed look in her eyes.<br />\nThe middle-aged man had gotten his coffee and cake and was<br />\nenjoying them while reading the<br />\npaper. Again I found myself in<br />\nfront of the blond youth, and<br />\nI could have strangled him as he<br />\nbarely even glanced at my birth<br />\ncertificate. But after ten<br />\nminutes I was the proud<br />\npossessor of a matriculation<br />\nnumber as a guest student at the<br />\nUniversity of Vienna. I existed;<br />\nI was #8403901.<br />\nLater in the year I began to<br />\nformulate a theory on how<br />\nVienna functions, and my experience with the bureaucracy<br />\nat the University contributed to<br />\none part of this theory. On one<br />\nhand Vienna is a slow-moving<br />\nbureaucracy in which one has<br />\nto stand in ten lines for ten<br />\nhours to accomplish nothing.<br />\nEverything is very lax, and the<br /><br />\nrules seem to change according<br />\nto the whim of some administrator. No one knows<br />\nwhat is going on within the<br />\nsame office, and a lot of emphasis is put on lunch, coffee<br />\nand cake. But somehow, if one<br />\ncan stick it out, and not lose<br />\none's documents while traveling<br />\nform one office to the next, one<br />\nlearns to survive and laugh the<br />\nwhole thing off. Some peopled<br />\neven begin to consider it charming, but I have not reached<br />\nthis stage of immunity yet.<br />\nThen on the other hard is the<br />\nprocess of buying a \"standing<br />\nplace\" at the Vienna State<br />\nOpera. Most theaters in Vienna provide standing places for<br />\n$1.00, and they are quite worthwhile as Vienna has a lot to<br />\noffer in the way of theater.<br />\nStanding through an entire<br />\nopera is an experience in itself,<br />\nbut - acquiring that standing<br />\nplace ticket is perhaps even<br />\nmore enlightening. The \"Magic<br />\nFlute\" started at 8:00 p.m.<br />\nwhich means that I had to be at<br />\nthe opera by 5:30. At about<br />\n5:20 I found myself on yet<br />\nanother line, and 1 began to<br />\nfear the worst. I stepped to the<br />\nside to see how long the line<br />\nwas, and a guard in a brown<br />\nuniform immediately barked,<br /><br />\n\u201cGe,back in line or you'll lose<br />\nYour llace.

Rosh<br />\nHashanah, the Jewish new<br />\nyear, was celebrated from last<br />\nSunday, September 15, to Tuesday, September 17. A period of<br />\ncontemplation follows this new<br />\nyear, and culminates in Yom<br />\nKippur, the Day of Atonement.<br />\nDuring the Yom Kippur, one<br />\nreflects on his relationship with<br />\nman and God in the previous<br />\nyear. On the final day one asks<br />\nfor forgiveness from his fellow<br />\nmen and from God. Yom Kippur begins at sundown on Tuesday, September 24, and ends at<br />\nsundown on Wednesday,<br />\nSeptember 25.<br />\nIt is a time spent fasting and<br />\npraying in a synagogue to show<br />\nthat one's mind is on God. A<br />\nShofar or ram's horn is blown<br />\nby the rabbi or designated<br />\nleader during the services. The<br />\nShofar is a symbol of freedom<br />\nand blowing it represents the<br />\nopening of man's mind and<br />\nheart. It is a signal for the corning year and a time to make<br /><br />\nlove skiing. I was not convinced, but there was no gettNg out<br />\nof the predicament.<br />\nI could not find a feasible excuse not to go skiing by morn.<br />\ning, so at about 9:00 am I was<br />\nstanding on skis waiting on line<br />\nfor the first chair lift. I had<br />\nskiied once before in my life,<br />\nnine years earlier, but I had<br />\nnever been on a lift. I managed<br />\nto survive the chair lift, and I<br />\nalmost started to have fun and<br />\ngain confidence in my athletic<br />\nabilities. But then I encountered<br />\na contraption known as the TBar. Nobody told me how it<br />\nworks, so I tried what seemed<br />\nreasonable; I tried to sit on the<br />\nthing. That proved rather<br />\ndisastrous as I fell flat on my<br />\nface, almost broke my glasses,<br />\nand held up a line of annoyed<br />\nand screaming skiiers for a<br />\nminute or so. Finally, the ski instructor, a strong young<br />\nAustrian fellow, showed me<br />\nwhat to do, and there I was on<br />\nthe top of what seemed like the<br />\nbiggest mountain in the world.<br />\nMy basic problem was one of<br />\nattitude; I was simply not<br />\nprepared for the ordeal and I<br />\ndid not want to ski. If I had<br />\nwanted to learn I would have<br />\napproached the whole thing differently. But thanks to the<br />\nmoral support of my friends,<br />\nthe ability of the ski instructor<br />\nto ski with me hanging on to<br />\nhim and the restaurants on the<br />\nslopes that kept me filled with<br />\nbeer, wine and brandy, I survived. After that my friends<br />\n\"allowed\" me to hike in the<br />\nmountains, which I did with<br />\ngreat pleasure. The next few<br />\ndays in those mountains proved to be four of the best days<br />\nof the entire year.<br />\nOne of the high points of my<br />\ntravels was a fascinating trip to<br />\nSlovenia, one of the republics<br />\nof Yugoslavia. Another good<br />\nfriend from my dorm came<br />\nfrom the city Ljublana, and I<br />\nwent home with her for six days<br />\nin April. After World War I<br />\nYugoslavia was established,<br />\nand it consists of six republics:<br />\nSlovenia, Serbia, Kroatia,<br />\nMacedonia,<br />\nBosniaHercegovinia and Montenegro.<br />\nThe people of these republics<br />\nare of different nationalities,<br />\nspeak different languages and<br /><br />\npossess different cultural<br />\nbackgrounds. This puts the nation in a fairly precarious<br />\npredicament as far as national<br />\nunity is concerned. As my<br />\nfriend's brother pointed out,<br />\nsocialism is not Yugoslavia's<br />\nmain problem; its problems<br />\narise from trying to govern a<br />\nnation that consists of may<br />\ncultures. It is quite evident, at<br />\nleast in Slovenia, that the<br />\nvarious peoples are highly nationalistic, and my friend considers herself Slovenian first,<br />\nYugoslavian second.<br />\nLjublana, the capital of<br />\nSlovenia, is another beautiful<br />\nand charming city that continues in the baroque style of<br />\nthe Austrian Empire. I suppose, however, that the system<br />\ndoes have its effect on the city<br />\nas many of the old buildings are<br />\nin a serious need of renovation.<br />\nThe surrounding countryside<br />\nof Slovenia, however, proved<br />\nto be most interesting for me.<br />\nOf all the sites including a cave,<br />\nsmall villages on the Adriatic<br />\nSea, the remains of a medieval<br />\ncity, I was almost fascinated by<br />\na hospital which bears little<br />\nresemblance to our own Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital. This particular hospital was built secretly in 1940 by the Slovenian partisans right in the middle of a<br />\nmountain cleft. This site was<br />\nchosen in order to keep the<br />\nfacility safe from the Germans,<br />\nand it treated about 262 patients (one of whom was<br />\nAmerican) with then-modern<br />\nmedical techniques until the end<br />\nof the war.<br />\nAs you have probably<br />\nfigured out by now I had a fantastic year, and I implore those<br />\nof you who can to spend at least<br />\na year studying abroad. In this<br />\narticle I have barely begun to<br />\nscratch the surface of my experiences, about which I can<br />\ntalk endlessly; just ask my<br />\nfamily and friends. I hope I<br />\nhave provided a flavor for what<br />\na year abroad can offer in the<br />\nhope that you too will take advantage of a study-abroad option.

The lavish praise this film<br />\nseems to be collecting wherever<br />\nit goes is by no means<br />\nundeserved.<br />\nWilliam Hurt won the Best<br />\nActor award at Cannes for his<br />\nmagnificent portrayal of Luis<br />\nMolina, a homosexual who<br />\nstrongly believes that he is a<br />\nwoman trapped in a man's<br />\nbody. Molina is serving a<br />\nsentence in prison for child<br />\nmolestation; in order to pass<br />\nthe time until he is paroled,<br />\nMolina busies himself by \"telling movies\" to his cell mate<br />\nValentin Arregui (Raul Julia).<br />\nWhile Hurt's \"movies\" start<br />\nout as little more than an annoyance to Julia, they eventually become a major focus of<br /><br />\ntheir relationship, as Julia will Hurt into the course of the<br />\nprogress from a bored attitude main film. What eould have<br />\nabout Hurt's stories to actual- been clumsy jumps from the<br />\nly asking Hurt to continue propaganda film to \"reality\"<br />\nwhere he left off last.<br />\nand back again are remarkably<br />\nThe movie which Hurt smooth. And the overacted,<br />\nspends most of his time recoun- cliched propaganda film itself<br />\nting is a Nazi propaganda film. serves to add a bit of humor to<br />\nHurt, seemingly oblivious to the bleak prison lives these two<br />\nthe politics involved in the men come to share.<br />\nmovie, finds the tale of the GerKiss of the Spider Woman<br />\nman SS officer and the does have a plot though, which<br />\nbeautiful French singer (Sonia goes beyond Hurt simply telling<br />\nBraga) who was smart enough movies and Julia simply listennot to be duped by the ing. The movie is about two<br />\nresistance to be a beautiful love radically different people who<br />\nstory. Julia, on the other hand, dramatically change each<br />\nas an ever-serious political other's lives until the pair are<br />\nprisoner, is stupified by this not so different after all. But<br />\nhomosexual who can sym- while the changes each<br />\npathize with the Naxis, a group character goes through are<br />\nwho made a point of destroy- great, they are by no means<br />\ning homosexuals throughout sudden. Director Babenco with<br />\nthe course of World War II.<br />\nscreenwriter Leonard Schrader<br />\nDirector Hector Babenco has make these major changes in<br />\ndisplayed the perfect touch with action and attitude gradual and<br />\nthe insertion of the movie graceful so while the Luis<br />\nwithin a movie being \"told\" by Molina and Valentin Arregui<br /><br />\nwho close the film are considerably different from the<br />\nLuis and Valentin who open it.<br />\nIt is difficult to find the one turning point where a character's<br />\nchanges might have occurred.<br />\nThe actual twists in plot only<br />\nserve to illustrate these changes<br />\nin character, as we find Luis or<br />\nValentin in situations we can be<br />\nsure they would not have been<br />\nfound in before the film's start.<br />\nThe sincerity of Hurt's many<br />\nkindnesses towards Julia is<br />\nbrought into question when it<br />\nseems<br />\nHurt<br />\nis<br />\nbeing<br />\nmanipulated by the warden into weaseling information from<br />\nhis cell mate. But it soon<br />\nbecomes obvious where Hurt's<br />\nloyalties lay, most notably in<br />\nmoving scenes such as where<br />\nHurt sympathetically mothers<br />\nJulia after the latter has a<br />\npoison-induced accident in his<br />\npants. A scene like this, as well<br />\nas the scenes which follow that<br />\nshow Hurt nursing Julia back<br /><br />\nto health, show just how far<br />\nthis virtually male/female relationship has come during the<br />\ncourse of the film.<br />\nWhile the plotline itself is<br />\nfine (although revealing in<br />\ndetail here would serve to ruin<br />\nthe movie), it is the characters<br />\nthat really make this film the<br />\nsuccess it is. Julia is excellent as<br />\nthe political prisoner who tries<br />\nto be a stoic unit! Hurt brings<br />\nout a new side of him; Hurt's<br />\nincredible job as a soft, pretty<br />\nwoman in a male shell, whose<br />\nlife Julia gives a sense of purpose,<br />\ncannot<br />\nbe<br />\noveremphasized.<br />\nThe movies within the movie,<br />\nthe flashbacks, and the dream<br />\nsequence used by the director<br />\nserve to set this film apart structurally from most other films of<br />\nrecent memory. This, plus the<br />\nquality of acting and<br />\nfascinating character development makes Kiss of the Spider<br />\nWoman essential movie fare.<br /><br />\nFive Star, Shy, Mr. Mister: Don't Volunteer<br />\nDescent into the Mainstream<br />\nby Steve Brett<br /><br />\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\nA strange thing happened to<br />\nme over the summer\u2014I started<br />\nrunning out of things to cornplain about. There was TV I<br />\nwanted to watch, I enjoyed the<br />\nmovies I saw; hell the deans<br />\neven reduced my rent. Most<br />\namazing (and disconcerting),<br />\nthough, was the fact that there<br />\nwere, for the first time in a<br />\nwhile, good pop songs on the<br />\nradio\u2014Top 40-AM radio, no<br />\nless. Sting, the Eurythmics,<br />\nKatrina and the Waves\u2014all<br />\ngood stuff; I didn't even mind<br />\nRaspberry Beret that much I<br />\nwas<br />\ngetting<br />\nseriously<br />\nconcerned\u2014were things really<br />\nso good or was I going going. . . Mainstream?!<br />\nImagine my relief then, when<br />\nI dropped by the News-Letter<br />\noffice at the end of the summer<br />\nand found a stack of undistinguished RCA records just<br />\nasking for abuse. All of them<br />\ntrying to capitalize on the latest<br />\nfad, all of them worthless excercises in uncreative corporate<br />\ngreed, or so I thought... Truth<br />\nis, the albums I've listened to so<br />\nfar haven't even been that ternble. Not extremely good<br />\nperhaps, but certainly,<br />\ntolerable. Damn. So just to<br />\nprove to myself that my tastes<br />\nhaven't regressed completely,<br />\nI've reviewed a couple of<br />\nalbums of my own choosing<br />\nwhich are decidedly less<br />\nmainstream.<br />\nFive Star: Luxury of Life<br />\nOf all the RCA albums, this<br />\none had the most potential to<br />\nbe truly exploitative: They're<br />\nblack, they're all in the same<br />\nfamily, and there just happens<br />\nto be five of them. Sound<br />\nfamiliar? Add to that the fact<br />\nthat the young boy in the band<br />\nlooks a lot like a young Micheal<br />\nand the older looks a lot like the<br />\nolder Micheal and well...there<br />\nyou have it. It turns out,<br />\nthough, that Five Star is already<br />\nquite popular in England. And<br /><br />\nit appears as if soon they're going to have some American success too. They're at their best<br />\nwhen they play a gentle funk<br />\nevocative of New Edition, as on<br />\n\"Love Take Over\" and<br />\n\"Let Me Be the One,\" but<br />\nthey're<br />\n.at<br />\ntheir<br />\nold synth-pop cliches\u2014the<br />\nballady \"Say Goodbye\" or the<br />\nrobotics of \"System Addict.\"<br />\nin all, however, not a bad<br />\neffort.<br />\nMr. Mister: Welcome to the<br />\nReal World.

Even so, this<br />\nband is a great example of just<br />\nhciw entrenched the synth has<br />\nbecome in modern pop. This<br />\nalbum is all rather pleasant, the<br />\nsynth having filled in all the<br />\nspaces and leaving it with a<br />\nrather fluffy consistency. Truly an album to fall asleep<br />\nto...My goodness, the lyrics,<br />\nthough: \"Time it passes much<br />\ntoo fast/and time I want to<br />\nmake it last.\" Halfway through<br />\nI suffered a banality attack.<br />\nShy: Brave the Storm. Admittedly the worst of the bunch but<br />\nstill better than the heavy-metal<br />\nartwork would imply.

If<br />\nyou're not sick of all these<br />\nsongs and don't own any of<br /><br />\nthese, this is a good place to get<br />\nthem. A worthwhile release if<br />\njust to get all the oldie hits onto one album.<br />\nMission of Burma: The<br />\nHorrible Truth About Burma.<br />\n(Ace of Hearts) The last possiL.t. \u2014tp.nce hy Mission of Burma,<br />\nma, arguabl one_ of the<br />\ngreatest American bands of the<br />\nlast decade. This is a compilation of live recordings made all<br />\nover the country during their<br />\nfinal tour a couple of years ago.<br />\nUnlike most live albums,<br />\nthough, all the songs here are<br />\npreviously unrecorded by<br />\nM.O.B. so this is equivalent to<br />\na brand new album. The live<br />\nformat doesn't hurt the album<br />\nin the least since the success of<br />\nMission of Burma always lied<br />\nin their sheer intensity and not<br />\nin their clarity. As with a lot of<br />\npost-punk this is perhaps not<br />\nvery accessible but once you're<br />\ninvolved it's emotionally overwhelming. In addition to the<br />\nthrobbing originals, they cover<br />\nthe Stooges (1970) and Pere<br />\nUbu (Heart of Darkness).<br />\nVolcano Suns:The Bright<br />\nOrange Years (Homestead)<br />\nThis band has been hailed, \"the<br />\nnext Husker Du.\" I always<br />\nthought, though, that Husker<br />\nDu owed alot to Mission of<br />\nBurma and indeed, the leader<br />\nof the Volcano Suns is none<br />\nother than Peter Prescott, the<br />\n-drummer of Mission of Burma.<br />\nLike Husker Du, they play a<br />\nkind of \"Folk Hardcore\" but<br />\nunlike that band its \"folk\" is<br />\nnot in the music but in the<br />\nlyrics. Prescott, who wrote<br />\nmost of the songs on the album,<br />\nmust have grown up on a<br />\nfarm\u2014songs likeCornfield,<br />\nAnimals,andlt's Stewtime bear<br />\nthis out. The rustic themes added to the post-punk throb of<br />\nPrescott (i.e. Mission of Burma) make this and extremely<br />\noriginal album. I doubt<br />\nanything like this has ever been<br />\ndone before.<br /><br />\nIf you believe that Splash! is<br />\na terrifically funny movie, that<br />\nStar Trek II: The Wrath of<br />\nKhan is a highly spirited and<br />\nmost enjoyable adventure film,<br />\nand that M*A *S*H and Cheers<br />\nare two of the highest-quality<br />\nsitcoms in recent memory, let<br />\nme ask you this: How do the<br />\nstars of Splash! plus the director of Star Trek II plus writers<br />\nwho have worked on<br />\nM *A *S*H and Cheers add up<br />\nto a movie as incredibly<br />\nmediocre as Volunteers?<br />\nThis is one equation which<br />\ndoesn't seem to balance.<br />\nAny comedy which carries<br />\nout its prime directive, to make<br />\nthe audience laugh, does not<br />\ndeserve an outright pan (provided the audience laughs with<br />\nthe movie and not at it).<br />\nVolunteers does have a number<br />\nof genuine laughs to its credit,<br />\nbut anyone who has seen the<br />\ntrailer for this film (about five<br />\nminutes of true hilarity) has<br />\nbeen exposed to nearly all the<br />\nlaughs they can expect the actual movie to deliver.<br />\nTom Hanks, hilarious in<br />\nSplash!, plays the playboy, sonof-a-millionaire, Yale senior<br />\nLawrence Bourne III. On<br />\ngraduation day, Hanks drops<br />\n$28,000 in one bet on the outcome of the basketball championship, and Lawrence<br />\nBourne, Jr.(George Plimpton)<br />\ndecides paying sonny's debt will<br />\ndo nothing to build Larry Ill's<br />\ncharacter. Without his father's<br />\nhelp, Hanks knows the only<br />\nway to keep the debt from being settled in blood would be to<br />\nhop on the first flight out of<br />\nthese United States. That flight<br />\nhappens to be to Thailand, and<br />\nstepping on board officially<br />\nenlists Hanks in the Peace<br />\nCorps.<br />\nOn the plane Hanks meets up<br />\nwith John Candy as Tom Tuttle from Tacoma. So funny as<br />\nHank's brother Freddy in<br />\nSplash!,<br />\nthe<br />\nriotous<br />\nHanks/Candy interplay from<br /><br />\nthat film simply isn't repeated<br />\nhere. The duo's exchanges in<br />\nVolunteers display none of the<br />\nchemistry which seemed to exist in the Ron Howard film. Be<br />\nthat as it may, the plane still<br />\npersists in heading to Thailand<br />\nwhere Hanks, Candy and Rita<br />\nWilson (playing Long IslandJAP Beth Wexler)are sent to a<br />\nsmall village with instructions<br />\nto construct a bridge across a<br />\nnearby river.<br />\nAnd when does all this take<br />\nplace? 1962, but you wouldn't<br />\nknow it. The series of black and<br />\nwhite film clips of sixties<br />\nluminaries and events does not<br />\nset the tone as director Nicholas<br />\nMeyer must have thought it<br />\nwould. Minor details, such as<br />\nWilson reading Profiles in<br />\nCourage or having the flight<br />\nleaving from Idlewilde Airport<br />\n(Kennedy Airport's original<br />\nname) just don't cut it. And<br />\nhaving the basketball championship where Hanks loses his<br />\nshirt being Lakers versus<br />\nCeltics, a match still fresh in the<br />\nmind of current sports fans, only adds to the 60s-80s confusion<br />\nthe film provides. Styles, attitudes, an anachronism or two<br />\nand even the film's antiidealistic moral all seem to<br />\nplace the film in an 80s frame<br />\nof reference.<br />\nWhen Hanks, Candy and<br />\nWilson arrive in the village to<br />\nbuild the bridge, complications<br />\ndevelop. The villagers don't<br />\nwant the bridge, but everyone<br />\nelse does: Red Chinese are<br />\nwaiting to cross it and take over<br />\nthe village, and an opium smuggler wants to cross it to gain access to the poppies which lie on<br />\nthe other side. Even the CIA<br />\nhas a vested interest in this feat<br />\nof civil engineering. Unfortunately, the complications just<br />\ndo not get complicated enough,<br />\nnot taking the twists and turns<br />\nnecessary to maintain any tension.

But<br />\nHanks remedies both of these<br />\nProblems with the greatest of<br />\nease, reducing what could have<br />\nbeen major developments to<br />\nmere annoyances easily set<br />\nright.<br />\nAnother flaw in this film lies<br />\nin its direction. Nicholas Meyer<br />\nseemed unable to decide<br />\nWhether to make this film a<br />\nPlausible comedy (with plausible or near-plausible situations<br />\nmade funny by humorous<br />\ndialogue or actions) or to make<br />\nthis an Airplane-style comedy,<br />\nWherein the majority of jokes<br />\nare funny because of how imPossible or ridiculous they<br />\nwould be in real life. Meyer's<br />\nmistake was to employ both<br />\nStyles of comedy here, and it<br />\ndoesn't work. For example,<br />\nJust as we are convinced that a<br />\ncertain scenario could occur in<br />\nreality, the characters will do<br />\nsomething such as read the subtitles from the bottom of the<br />\nscreen.<br />\nThe film's conclusion is most<br />\nunsatisfying, and downright<br />\n\u2022 surprising in view of the fact<br />\nthat Volunteers' director also<br />\ndirected TV's politically leftoriented The Day After. Rather<br />\nthan having Hanks' unsympathetic playboy attitude<br />\nchanged in light of his Peace<br />\nCorps experiences, it is Hanks'<br />\nattitude which finally corrupts<br />\neverybody else, from his once<br />\nIdealistic Peace Corps comrades<br /><br />\ndown to the once innocent Thai<br />\nvillagers. If Meyer was so intent<br />\non having this film take place<br />\nin 1962, the least he could have<br />\ndone would be to have the con-<br /><br />\nclusion fit in with the preKennedy assasination Camelot<br />\nstatcof mind rather than with<br />\nthe corrupt hedonism of<br />\nAmerica today.<br /><br />\nSt. Paul Cleaners<br /><br />\n3120 St.<br />\nPaul St.<br />\n235-4413<br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAYCLEANING<br />\nAND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRAIG<br /><br />\nPICK-UP &amp; DELIVERY NOW AVAILABLE ON<br />\nOR NEAR CAMPUS<br />\nScSoSuWin SAM *********incoming<br />\n:\u2022\u2022\u2022Win *<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n07.a.<br />\n4r\u2022181f*as\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1007o discount-on all dry cleaning. i<br /><br />\ne xers1JP4J4041*******\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022:<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nArthur S.

By Marguerite<br />\nDuras, Pantheon Books,<br />\n$11.95. 117 pp.<br />\nThe Lover is a gem of a<br />\nbook. Small, simple, and highly<br />\npolished, it succeeds at catching<br />\nlight and giving a new elegance<br />\nto autobiography, blending it<br />\nsmoothly with fiction until the<br />\ndifferences don't matter<br />\nanymore.<br />\nThis is a foreign novel. Its<br />\nauthor, Marguerite Duras, is<br />\none of France's oldest and most<br />\ncelebrated authors, but remains<br />\nrelatively unknown by this<br />\ncountry's popular reading audience. In The Lover, the<br />\nFrench feeling is everywhere;<br />\nthe dreamlike, present-tense<br />\nwriting, and the strong erotic<br />\nimagery. It seems to effortlessly avoid the crude explicitness<br />\nwhich dominates modern fiction, yet is highly charged. The<br />\nbook is romantic in the best<br />\nsense of the word; it goes<br />\nbeyond the couple to all the<br />\npeople around them, their surroundings, their world.<br />\nThe story's narrator is a<br />\n15-year-old French girl whose<br />\nwidowed mother has settled in<br />\nCambodia. The mother is a<br />\nstrange, shabbily-dressed<br />\nschool headmistress going<br />\nsenile, her brothers are itinerant<br />\ngood-for-nothings; the younger<br />\none loves Duras but is weak,<br />\nthe other delights in hearing her<br />\nbeaten. These Europeans living<br />\noff the graces of Southeast Asia<br />\nhave nothing glamourous about<br /><br />\nthem. There is no Jewel-in-theCrown colonialism, no sense of<br />\ngrandeur.<br />\nThe girl's family has lost its<br />\nmoney and lives in squalid<br />\ndecay. While the family still has<br />\nan unpaid houseboy, it is \"garbage\" he serves them\u2014\"storks,<br />\nbaby crocodiles.\" The heroine<br />\ndresses in silken rags, gold lame<br />\nevening shoes and a man's<br />\nfedora, desperate to be different and make something<br />\nbeautiful out of the chaos.<br />\nDuring the school year, the<br />\nheroine sleeps at a state-run<br />\nboarding school and attends<br />\nclasses at her mother's French<br />\nhigh school. As one of two<br />\nwhite pupils at the boarding<br />\nschool, she is allowed complete<br />\nfreedom to come and go at<br />\nnight. She does this with daily<br />\nfrequency once she accepts a<br />\nride from \"the lover,\" who remains nameless throughout the<br />\nwhole book.<br />\nThey meet symbolically, as<br />\nthe girl is crossing the water<br />\nfrom her mother's shack to the<br />\nschool in Saigon. There is a<br />\nriver of difference separating<br />\nthe Asians from the whites\u2014a<br />\nvastness far too horrifying for<br />\neither society to even talk<br />\nabout.<br />\nThe lover is close to thirty,<br />\nChinese, Paris-educated, and<br />\nwealthy. He lounges beside his<br />\nchauffered black limousine<br />\nwatching the girl for days. She<br />\ninitially takes a ride with him<br />\nfor his wealth, and tells him this<br />\nquite candidly after their first<br />\nlove-making session. This hardness, this lack of sentimentali-<br /><br />\nty and feeling makes him mad<br />\nfor her. And she falls in love<br />\nwith the feel, the aura of<br />\npassion.<br />\nThere are long, hot afternoons in his apartment in<br />\nSaigon. There are longer, stultifying evenings when he takes<br />\nher family to elegant Chinese<br />\nrestaurants and nightclubs.<br />\nThey do not speak to him; they<br />\ncannot comprehend his stature<br />\nas a person, let alone the<br />\ndaughter's lover. Yet they eat<br />\nhis food and drink his wine,<br />\nlater beating the girl who cries<br />\nover and over that they are not<br />\nlovers, they are just friends.<br />\nThis issue of racism is handled gracefully by the author.<br />\nWhile Duras' family considers<br />\nthe lover a horrifying disgrace,<br />\npoverty binds them to him.<br />\nWhile the girl's whiteness gives<br />\nher power over the lover, he can<br />\nnever marry her. To the lover's<br />\npowerful, landowner father,<br />\nDuras is just \"the little white<br />\nwhore from Sadec.\" In the end<br />\nit is Duras, the object of desire,<br />\nwho is the true pariah. Rejected<br />\nby her .schoolfriends, family,<br />\nthe Chinese and Cambodians,<br />\nshe addresses a bleak destiny<br />\nalone.<br />\nrun<br />\nhigh<br />\nEmotions<br />\nthroughout the story, yet never<br />\nverge on melodrama. Duras'<br />\nclipped, elegant prose augments<br />\nthe lush setting instead of overwhelming with \"exotic\"<br />\ndetails. Simple language sweeps<br />\nthe reader into a dream-like<br />\nstate. As in dreaming, one finds<br />\nit hard to follow the thread for<br />\nthe whole time, especially since<br /><br />\nthe story is presented in vignettes which flip from past to<br />\npresent.<br />\nThis lack of suspense, this<br />\noccasional wandering is the<br />\nnovel's sole weakness. But our<br />\ncriticism of stories which are<br />\nless than a-thrill-a-minute is<br /><br />\nprobably a culturally based<br />\none. The Lover meanders<br />\nnaturally, fluidly, like conversation. We should listen to this<br />\nforeign voice, delight in its<br />\nslower pace, and marvel at its<br />\nbrilliance.<br /><br />\nScience Can be Interesting<br />\nby Tim McNamara<br />\nThe Edge of Tomorrow.

To illustrate tghe mechanisms of this<br />\nprocess, the twenty-four entries<br />\nin this collection draw upon the<br />\ngamut of scientific endeavor,<br />\nranging from biochemistry (in<br />\nwhich area Asimov holds a<br />\nPh.D.) to cosmology, from<br />\nphysics to immunology, with<br />\ngenerous helpings of computer<br />\nscience,<br />\ngeometry<br />\nand<br />\nchemistry to name a few.<br />\nAs usual, Asimov explains<br />\nthe scientific principals he<br />\npresents in an exceedingly clear<br />\nand readily comprehensible<br />\nfashion, designed to interest<br />\neven a layman:<br />\nIn the 1840s the first<br />\nreally effective anesthetics<br />\nwere introduced and the<br />\npossibility arose that pain<br />\nmight be abolished as a<br />\nnecessary accompaniment<br />\nof surgery and that<br />\nhospitals might cease to<br />\nbe the most exquisitely<br />\norganized<br />\ntorture<br />\nchambers in the history of<br /><br />\nman.

Family support,<br />\nhowever, can make a huge difference in a patient's ability to<br />\ncope with the diagnosis.<br />\n\u2022 James Zabora, director of<br />\npatient and family services at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Oncology<br />\nCenter, is presently working on<br />\nseveral projects which examine<br />\nthe impact of a cancer diagnosis<br />\non the family, as well as on the<br />\npatients themselves. The aim of<br />\nthese. studies is to determine<br />\nwhat types of behavior occur<br />\nfollowing the diagnosis of<br />\ncancer, and what types of<br />\npsychiatric interventions may<br />\nbe necessary to deal with these<br />\nbehaviors. Zabora is also the<br />\ndirector of the Joanne<br />\nRockwell Memorial house, a<br />\ntemporary residential facility<br />\nfor families of cancer patients<br />\nwho are undergoing treatment<br />\nat Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nZabora's work began about<br />\ntwo years ago when he began to<br />\nlook at the wide variety of patients' responses to the<br />\ndiagnosis of cancer. A previous<br />\n.t tidy at the Harvard School of'<br />\nMedicine had shown that a majority of patients, when charted<br />\nover a year's time, reach a peak<br />\n- of emotional distress within the<br />\nfirst two months.

Doctors<br />\nand nurses were asked, without<br />\nknowledge of the FACES<br />\nscores, to identify which<br />\nfamilies displayed at least one<br />\nof six certain behaviors which<br />\ntend to indicate stress. These<br />\nbehaviors include interfering<br />\nwith medical treatment, noncompliance, or complete<br />\navoidance of the patient and<br />\nthe entire situation. These<br />\nbehaviors were found to exist in<br />\nabout one-third of the families.<br />\nThe FACES was shown to<br />\npredict 86% of the time which<br />\nfamilies would or would not exhibit any of these behaviors.<br />\nZabora encountered a problem, however, when he began<br />\na prospective study in March of<br />\n1983.

It features the<br />\n3-4-3 with a monster similar<br />\nto Hopkins.<br />\nIn its opening game last<br />\nweek, Swarthmore dropped a<br />\n20-14 decision to RandolphMacon. Randolph-Macon was<br />\nnot able to run on Swarthmore,<br />\nbut was effective in throwing<br />\nthe football. That is godd news<br />\nto quarterback Mark Campbell<br />\nand the Blue Jay's receiving<br />\ncorp.<br />\n\"Last year, we ran the ball<br />\nwell against them,\" said<br />\nPfiefer. \"Hopefully, the run<br />\nand the pass will set up each<br />\nother but we must prevent them<br />\nfrom controlling the line of<br />\nsrimmage.\"<br />\nPfiefer says this year's squad<br />\nhas the strongest running corps<br />\never at Hopkins.
