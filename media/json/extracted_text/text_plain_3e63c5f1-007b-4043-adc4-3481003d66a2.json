SHR1VER.<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT PATTON'S<br />\nMESSAGE.<br />\nWhen President Patton speaks, it behooves<br />\nevery student to lend an attentive ear, not only<br />\nbecause all that he says is worthy of deepest<br />\nconsideration, but also because if one does not<br />\nlisten closely, one fails to hear almost every<br />\nfifth word. His style, however, is piquant, and<br />\nat times quaint. His premises and conclusions<br />\nare clearly marked, and without doubt he believes what he says. For a man to attempt to<br />\nspeak of Morals and Religion\" in any coherent manner, with all his notes for an hour's<br />\ntalk on a sheet three by four is, forsooth, a<br />\ntask before which even a Presbyterian minister might hesitate. But President Patton not<br />\nonly showed that what he said was the product of deep personal thought, but\u2014what is<br />\nmore essential\u2014he set his hearers to thinking<br />\nfor themselves. His arguments were striking,<br />\nhis conclusions are not lightly to be set aside,<br />\nand the question comes to every sincere man,<br />\n\"How does all this affect. me? How am I to<br />\n<br />\nNo. xo<br />\n<br />\nconvert my convictions into actions ?\"<br />\nDr. Patton spoke of \"Moral Obligation,\"<br />\nof \"The Good\" and of \"The Right.\" He<br />\nglanced at the various ethical schools, and<br />\nstruck off many apt comparisons. He showed<br />\nin an incontestable manner that no adequate<br />\nidea of moral obligation can be had until you<br />\nenthrone the Almighty and put a moral Governor above you. 'Tis then, and then only, that<br />\nthe idea of obligation can have any true influence in the amelioration of mankind. We find<br />\nin our nature a powerful tendency to degeneration, and if we are to journey toward perfection there must be not only an external<br />\nstandard whereby our conduct may be judged,<br />\nbut there must be also an equally powerful<br />\nforce impelling us away from our natural tendencies. A standard of infinite good and right<br />\nby which man's finite doings may be counted<br />\ncan come only from a true conception of the<br />\nattributes of an infinite being\u2014a perfect personality. 'Tis in the presence of such conceptions that the edicts of that infinite being will<br />\nfurnish the force necessary to raise man up out<br />\nof the mire of his natural tendencies. The<br />\nedict must get its force from the power of the<br />\npersonality behind it. If you are going to control the personality of man and obtain morality, the law must he given with the thunder of<br />\nMount Sinai, saying: \"Thou shalt not.\"<br />\nSome people would lay aside religion and<br />\nconsider morality as a separate idea. But the<br />\nearthquake that pulls the church down will<br />\nshake with equal force the foundations of the<br />\nethical lecture hall. Take away religion and<br />\nmorals will soon disappear. Albeit that morality is instructive, when once you have removed God you have abolished obligatory<br />\nmorality forever, and all that you have left is<br />\na morality of good form and good taste.<br />\nUnder such conditions, how long, think ye,<br />\nwould this world be a fit dwelling-place for<br />\nthe children of men ?<br />\nPresident Patton omitted any fruitless discussion of \"Determinism\" or \"Libertarianism,\" but insisted equally upon the infinite<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS -LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nsovereignty of God and upon the free agency<br />\nof man. On nothing else did he lay more<br />\nstress than upon the fact that there can be no<br />\nmoral obligation unless there be a subject of<br />\nthat obligation\u2014free to feel, think and act.<br />\nAll the morality of the universe resolves itself<br />\ninto selfhood \u2014 the power of self-determination. We are not mere machines. It is necessary for us to realize fully that we can act of<br />\nour own accord, even against a prevailing<br />\nhabit. In a man's character nature determines<br />\nmuch, and habit goes on and determines more,<br />\nyet they do not determine all ;<br />\n\" holds its<br />\nown against both. We must have great actions;<br />\nlet us then, as Emerson suggests, make our<br />\nown so. That man reaches the highest pinnacle of character who most truly and fully<br />\ntranslates into actions on this terrestial ball<br />\nthe thoughts of the most high God.<br />\nWe must not avoid facts. We must see that<br />\nthere is a standard by which our actions arc<br />\njudged, and an end to which they will carry<br />\nus, if they be conformed to that standard. The<br />\nstandard is the Right,\" the end the \"Good.\"<br />\nNeither of these ideas is to be made- subordinate to the other. They are co-ordinate, and<br />\nmutually parallel. But what is the \"Good ?\"<br />\nEvery man leans to that which is most desirable to him, and the logical conclusion is that<br />\nthere is something supremely desirable. Some<br />\nseek wealth, because that brings surpassing<br />\ngrandeur, or immunity from toil, they seek a<br />\nsurplus of pleasure.<br />\nHe who tortures his<br />\nmemory with innumerable languages does the<br />\nsame thing in a different way. Both seek happiness, and the result is the same, whether it<br />\ncome from successful shop-keeping or successful word-monging. Is man's destiny, then,<br />\nbut to be happy? If we look only at pleasure,<br />\nwe are unable to distinguish between the<br />\nheaven of the hog and the saint's heaven. The<br />\nhog's manners are to us somewhat unconventional, but,could he speak, would he not reply<br />\nthat he preferred the freedom of his trough to<br />\nthe starched stiffness of our dining-rooms? We<br />\ncannot say that pleasure is the end of life, but<br />\nmust find sonic more rational ground for happiness. The end toward which we strive is<br />\nmoral perfection. In this matter no idea but<br />\none of progress to higher goals can be<br />\n<br />\nthought of. Drummond says : \"It is only a<br />\ncharacter which is itself developing that can<br />\naid the evolution of the world and so fulfill the<br />\nend of life.\" To such a progress the end must<br />\nbe infinite ; and this is God. So far as we can<br />\nsee, the destiny of every part of everybody is<br />\nto become, by growth and development, a perfect part. Is it not the same for man as a<br />\nwhole ? Self-realization is the \"Good\" to be<br />\nreached. The glory of God, which some consider the chief end of man, is not incompatible<br />\nwith man's self-realization ; on the contrary,<br />\nit is to be reached through self-realization.<br />\nSince man is made in the image of God, and<br />\nGod is perfect, the highest honor that man can<br />\npay to God is earnestly to strive to reach the<br />\nsame perfection.<br />\nIf the ideal is to be of any value, we must<br />\nbelieve it to be attainable ; we must separate it<br />\nfrom the life of this world, and then we must<br />\nconceive another life in which to enjoy it.<br />\nTherefore, if the idea be attainable, and the<br />\nblackness of pessimism is upon those that<br />\nthink not so, there must be God, freedom and<br />\nimmortality. For it cannot be said that character will develop in all its fullness in this life.<br />\nThat were a time far too short for an evolution<br />\nso glorious. We see here only the small green<br />\nblade which hut determines what we ultimately shall be. Ultimately\u2014that is a long<br />\nway off, but not too long to take into reckoning. When the fires of the sun shall have<br />\nburned themselves to ashes, we shall not have<br />\ncompleted our cathedral of character, we shall<br />\nstill be building.<br />\nWill the building last ?<br />\nHear\u2014\" He that doeth the will of God abideth<br />\nforever.\"<br />\nCHARLES KEYSER<br />\nEDMUNDS.<br />\n<br />\nA LAMENT.<br />\n<br />\nMy love is fair.

Some good music was played by Renz's<br />\norchestra, conducted by Mr. Edwin L. Turnbull. The impressive chant, \"Benedictus,\"<br />\nsung by Messrs. Robert H. Hughes, David E.<br />\nFrancis, Edwin L. Turnbull and Thomas S.<br />\nBaker, is Mr. Turnbull's own composition.<br />\nRev. J. Eccleston, S. T. D., led the prayer at<br />\nthe opening of the formal exercises. As in<br />\nformer years, we had a celebrated guest as<br />\nmain speaker of the occasion. The Hon.<br />\nCharles Kendall Adams, President of the University of Wisconsin, delivered an address on<br />\nThe Support of Higher Education by the<br />\nState.\" The degree of Ph. D. was conferred<br />\non the following gentlemen :<br />\nCharles William Peppier, A. B., Hopkins,<br />\n1892.<br />\nEbenezer Emmet Reid, A. M., Richmond<br />\nCollege, 1892.<br />\nWilliam Berney Saffold, A. B., University<br />\nof Alabama, 1889.<br />\nThree men received the A. B. degree, viz:<br />\nRobert Ernest Belknap.<br />\nWilliam Cazenove Gardner.<br />\nCharles Smith Lewis.<br />\nCONURESSIONAL DEBATERS.<br />\n<br />\nContrary to our bold expectations, our representative 'champions seemed rather crestfallen during the last manoeuvre. The brilliant scheme of the rotary turret failed for lack<br />\nof points. The points on the immigration<br />\nquestion, as the reader may remember, were to<br />\nform the steel armor of this novel structure.<br />\nThe general criticised with severe justice the<br />\nbearing of our troops. On the whole, these<br />\nsymptoms gladden the Senate's spirits, as evident signs of final victory. For the very soldiers who wince and bow their heads as the<br />\nfirst shells are humming above them, will<br />\ncoolly face the jaws of death's batteries on the<br />\nday of battle. Whereas premature bravado is<br />\nproverbially common with bad fighting stock.<br />\nBy command of the general, different tactics<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nwill be pursued in the next manoeuvre. Morning exercise, in \"intensity\" will no longer<br />\nbe followed by headache on the field. The<br />\nsoldiers' hands, which are to hurl forensic<br />\nbombs at our enemies, will do execution outside of the trousers pockets. Thus prepared,<br />\nand equipped with stores of ammunition pro<br />\nand con, two champions will surely repel the<br />\nattack of a dozen bush rangers. The council<br />\nof war .will note any dangerous movements<br />\nemployed by the enemy to embody them in<br />\nthe plan for the decisive battle. This plan is<br />\nstrictly secret ; betrayal of any part of it will<br />\nbe regarded as high treason.<br />\nThe members of the House of Representatives who have been appointed for the public<br />\ndebate are actively and energetically preparing themselves for the coming conflict with<br />\nthe Senate. The men are working faithfully,<br />\nand are bent upon corning off victorious on<br />\nthe momentous day of battle. They assemble<br />\nregularly, in order to criticise each other's<br />\nstyle, and to practice extemporaneous speaking. Their efforts toward perfecting themselves in public speaking have so far been<br />\ncrowned with success.<br />\nThe House was agreeably surprised in the<br />\nlast meeting with the change they are undergoing. Messrs. Morgan and French, who<br />\nwere pitted against one-third of the House,<br />\nspoke forcibly and to the point, and showed<br />\nthat they merited the approbation of the Censor. The following plan of debate was pursued : Messrs. Morgan and French presented<br />\nfacts, while the speakers who opposed them<br />\ngave some of the arguments the Senate would<br />\nprobably bring to bear against them. The<br />\nobject was to give the regular speakers most<br />\nof the arguments the Senate could present, so<br />\nthat on the day of contest they would be prepared to refute them.<br />\nSeveral curious arguments were unearthed<br />\nduring the discussion. Mr. Jungbluth seemed<br />\nto think that the vital point of the question<br />\nhinged on the advisability of excluding the<br />\nGerman servant girl. Mr. Fischer, however,<br />\nwas not to be outdone by him, but instantly<br />\ntook the floor in behalf of the buxom Neapoli(Conttnued on page 8.)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nCjcpetuglAetter.<br />\nPublished Portnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nFEBRUARY 24, 1898.<br />\nSubscription P.5o per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nAssistant Editor in Chief, Consulting Editors, -<br />\n<br />\nEDGEWORTH SMITH, '98.<br />\nALBERT C.

Nearly everybody with any interest, past or present, in<br />\n\"Torn\" Hopkins, was there to see for himself, and those who stayed away have no doubt<br />\nbeen told often enough how much they<br />\nmissed.<br />\nThe \"feed\" was good and plentiful; the stunt<br />\ngames were all very funny. But the features<br />\nof the evening were the addresses by President<br />\nGilman, Mr. McLane and Mr. Geo. C. Morrison, '90, with which the ceremonies began.<br />\nThey contained many suggestions well deserving our attention. A particularly good example of these is Mr. Morrison's plan for a<br />\n\"Hopkins Country 'Club,\" which has been<br />\nenergetically taken up and promises to give<br />\nsubstantial results. The speakers were also<br />\nearnest in appealing to the students to take advantage of their opportunities. \"The University is doing its duty by you,\" said Mr. Morrison, \"now help yourselves.\" Withal, the<br />\nspeeches were really interesting\u2014not one whit<br />\ntedious. Laughter and applause they received<br />\nin abundance; and they deserved it.<br />\n<br />\nBefore our next issue the Junior Class will<br />\nhave held its annual class banquet. Or perhaps we should only say\u2014since no future event<br />\nis a certainty, especially a Junior Class banquet<br />\n\u2014will have tried to hold its banquet. In any<br />\ncase, it is not difficult to predict that this occasion will be most fruitful of class feeling and<br />\nthat a large fraction of our undergraduate<br />\nbody will appear at the University next morning with sleeves metaphorically rolled up and<br />\nwith an eye for gore. On the whole, class spirit<br />\nhas this year been so commendably subordinated to University spirit that we cannot fin.d<br />\nit in our hearts to condemn a merely occasional<br />\non<br />\nAs a safety valve for the animal spirits<br />\nof under-class men it is highly commendable<br />\nWe must also make allowance for the extreme<br />\nyouth of some of those who may be among the<br />\nactive participants. \"Boys will be boys,\" as the<br />\nold folks say. And it must be confessed that<br />\nour Freshmen this year seem more than usually unwilling to lay aside childish things. Perhaps they may at any rate save some \"erring\"<br />\nJunior, even against his will, from the evils of<br />\nindigestion or of something worse.<br />\nBut should an encounter result next morning from their well meant missionary efforts<br />\nthe night of the banquet, we urge that they<br />\navoid therein the rude unsympathetic pavement of the McCoy Hall basement.

ADAMS' ADDRESS.<br />\nOn the 18th of February, Professor Adams<br />\ndelivered the Phi Beta Kappa oration at<br />\nWilliam and Mary College on the study and<br />\nteaching of history. Professor Adams was<br />\nespecially welcomed there as a guest since it<br />\nwas largely due to the publication of a monograph by him, that public interest was revived in this old historic landmark on higher<br />\neducation in America. Owing to the serious<br />\nlosses sustained by the college during the<br />\nCivil War, the institution had to be closed.<br />\nIt is rather curious to note, that although all<br />\nwork had ceased entirely, the President, the<br />\nsole survival of the faculty, used to ring the<br />\nold chapel bell at sunrise on the first day of<br />\nthe autumn session each year.<br />\nIt was at,this old institution that the study<br />\nof history and politics was developed and carried on long before the Northern institutions<br />\neven considered such a course. It was here<br />\nthat were trained the Southern statesmen of<br />\nthe old regime\u2014such as John Randolph and<br />\nChief-Justice Marshall.<br />\nProfessor Adams suggested in his monograph that William and Mary be revived as<br />\na training school for statesmen, a West Point,<br />\nas it were, for the development of diplomatists.<br />\nHe urged that such courses of study should be<br />\nfollowed as would prepare men for public life,<br />\nand also for the civil service. Professor<br />\nAdams' rocommendations were never entirely<br />\ncarried out, but his monograph attracted widespread notice. Copies of it were put into the<br />\nhands of the members of the Virginia Legislature, and public pressure was brought to<br />\nbear to such an extent that an appropriation<br />\nwas made for the revival of the college. Since<br />\nits reopening the institution has been doing a<br />\nvaluable work as a normal college; special attention being laid on the training of teachers<br />\nfor the public schools. The students taught<br />\nat public expense\u2014this class includes by far<br />\nthe largest number\u2014are required to teach in<br />\nthe public schools of the State for at least two<br />\nyears. This system has secured for the State<br />\nan efficient corps of public teachers.<br />\nAt the present session of the Legislature, a<br />\nbill was reported favorably which would re-<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nduce the annual appropriation from fifteen<br />\nthousand dollars to seven thousand and five<br />\nhundred, on the grounds that the work being<br />\ndone did not justify so large an appropriation.<br />\nThere also seems to be a sentiment current<br />\namong quite a large number of the members<br />\nof the Legislature to do aWay entirely with<br />\nappropriations, and even to confiscate the college buildings and chattels, despite the decision of the United States Supreme Court on<br />\nthe famous Dartmouth College case, declaring<br />\nthe invalidity of such a course. It is to be<br />\nhoped that such unjust measures will not be<br />\nemployed. William and Mary's record in the<br />\npast has earned for it the financial and moral<br />\nsupport of the State.<br />\nIt seems only right that those collegiate institutions which have contributed to the intellectual, and even the material progress of a<br />\nState, should not be allowed to suffer from neglect and ingratitude in times of adversity.<br />\nThe Maryland Legislature would also do well<br />\nto take it to heart that those institutions within<br />\nthe State which have so ably stood for higher<br />\neducation\u2014yes, so ably that Maryland and<br />\nBaltimore have become much more widely<br />\nknown and famous for being the seat of<br />\nthem\u2014should not have their future operations<br />\ncramped and retarded by unfortunate unforeseen financial troubles.<br />\nProfessor Adams was delighted with his<br />\ntrip. While there, he was initiated into the<br />\nmysteries of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. It<br />\nis interesting to note that this society\u2014the<br />\noldest of its kind in America\u2014was founded at<br />\nWilliam and Mary in 1776.<br />\n<br />\nThe third of the series of Hopkins' musicales<br />\ntook place on February 12th. The programme<br />\nwas well chosen, and a quintet by Doorak for<br />\npiano and strings was in particular well rendered. Miss Pagon's singing was also good.<br />\nA number of people stayed to the reception<br />\nafterwards.<br />\nDr. E. W. Sikes, Ph. D., '97, has been promoted to the post of full professor of political<br />\nscience and history in Wake Forest College.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nBASE BALL SCHEDULE.<br />\n<br />\nThe following schedule has been arranged<br />\nfor the baseball team by Manager Haulenbeek.<br />\nMarch 25\u2014Catholic University, in Baltimore.<br />\nMarch 26\u2014Georgetown University, in Washington.<br />\nMarch 30\u2014Maryland Agricultural College, in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nApril 8\u2014Wake Forest, in Raleigh, N.

In the lockerroom, which is heated from above, the cement<br />\nfloor is always cold. When the bare-footed<br />\ngymnast first steps on it he is chilled suddenly<br />\nand from this several have already caught<br />\ncolds. Strips of coarse matting spread before<br />\nthe lockers would not be expensive, and would<br />\ndo much to remedy the evil.<br />\n<br />\nATHLETIC rlISCELLANY.<br />\n<br />\nArrangements have been made for putting<br />\na track in the cage. The track is to be a cinder<br />\none, built under the guidance of Mr. Mackdermott, whose experience in this line is invaluable. The track will be a most welcome<br />\naddition to the cage, especially in view of the<br />\nfact that many of the runners are now complaining of twisted ankles and sore muscles,<br />\ncaused by the very uneven ground and sharp<br />\ncurves of the cage.<br />\nThe hockey team's trip to Philadelphia failed<br />\nto result in any victory for the Black and Blue.<br />\nThe men, nevertheless, made a very good<br />\nshowing when it is considered that over half<br />\nthe regular men were laid up. The first game<br />\nwith the strong University of Pennsylvania<br />\nteam was very close, and the second game<br />\nwhich was more one-sided, was played almost<br />\nentirely with scrubs.<br />\nProfessor Doyle of the Baltimore Athletic<br />\nClub will today begin instructing the students<br />\nin the art of wrestling. We may justly expect<br />\nto develop some clever wrestlers under the<br />\nexperienced, scientific care of Professor<br />\nDoyle.<br />\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays classes in fencing will be held.<br />\nThe classes in gymnasium work have become so large that Dr. Crenshaw is obliged to<br />\nhave two assistants to aid him in instructing<br />\nthe many new students. The assistants are<br />\nvery capable men, two of the best gymnasts of<br />\nthe Turnverein Vorwaerts. This extensive<br />\ninterest in gymnasium work proper is very<br />\ngratifying, and will surely develop many<br />\n\"dark horses.\"<br />\nMr. T. F. P. Cameron,'94, and Mr. F. Lupton, Medical School, are daily to he seen playing lacrosse in the cage. Their presence is<br />\nespecially effective in stimulating the new material.<br />\nMr. Murkland, who recently broke his ankle<br />\nin the cage, is rapidly convalescing, and, it is<br />\nhoped, will be back at the University very<br />\nsoon.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nrIEDICAL SCHOOL NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nMuch interest is manifested throughout the<br />\nMedical School in regard ,to the anti-vivisection bill now pending before the Senate of the<br />\nUnited States. *While this bill would not directly affect the work here, it is feared that its<br />\npassage would exert great influence upon the<br />\nMaryland Legislature to pass a similar bill. A<br />\npetition has been presented in the Senate by<br />\nSenator Gorman, signed by the deans of all<br />\nthe medical schools in the city, and by other<br />\nprominent men, including President Gilman<br />\nand Dr. Osier, praying against the passage of<br />\nthe bill.<br />\nIn the number of the Journal of the American Medical Association for February 5 Dr.<br />\nWelch has p'ublished a long article clearly setting forth the arguments against the bill, and<br />\nupholding the value of vivisection as it is<br />\npracticed in the leading universities, medical<br />\nschools and experimental laboratories in the<br />\ncountry. It is the best argument for animal<br />\nexperimentation published in some time, and<br />\nshould be read by all interested in the subject.<br />\nThe course in forensic medicine given by Dr.<br />\nRobert Fletcher of Washington, D. C., and intended for the members of the two upper<br />\nclasses, will begin in the amphitheatre on Friday, February 25.<br />\nMembers of the first year are building many<br />\nair castles as regards the new physiological<br />\nbuilding to be erected on the vacant ground,<br />\ncorner of Washington and Monument streets,<br />\nbut it seems doubtful if it will be finished in<br />\ntime for the usual Fall work. When completed, it will be very convenient, and will<br />\nsave much valuable time now lost in the trip<br />\nacross town to the University, to attend the<br />\nlectures in physiology,<br />\nMr. William R. Dancey of the second year<br />\nwho has been sick in the hospital for some<br />\ntime, is. now convalescent.<br />\nDuring the hockey game on Tuesday, February 8, Mr. Joseph T. Butler of the first year<br />\n<br />\nwas painfully hurt by having his foot badly<br />\ncut with an adversary's skate. He sustained<br />\na compound fracture of the first phalanx of<br />\nthe fourth toe, but aside from the inconvenience of having to go about on crutches, he is<br />\nnow doing nicely.<br />\nDr. Barker's lectures on the nervous system<br />\nhave begun in the course in histology for the<br />\nfirst-year students. These lectures are particularly fine, and are,' as usual, attended by<br />\nmany members of the upper classes as well.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Y.<br />\n<br />\nC. A.

The alarm was turned in\u2014the fire<br />\ndepartment attended to the water. Uncle<br />\nDaniel serenely drank his coffee and came<br />\ndown punctually to his business at J. H. U.<br />\nWe are pleased that no serious damage was<br />\ndone to his home.<br />\nA society, whose members are drawn from<br />\nthe graduate departments, medical school and<br />\nSenior and Junior undergraduate classes, has<br />\nbeen recently formed. The club is for social<br />\npurposes, and election to membership in it is<br />\nintended as an honor for those who have done<br />\ngood work for the University. It has adopted<br />\nthe colors of the University and bears on its<br />\npin the letter \"U\" with a smaller Greek \"delta\"<br />\non each side, and a hand with the forefingers<br />\npointing upward. The present list of members is: Messrs. Clunet, Dieffenbach, V. E.<br />\nSmith, Grimes, Levering, C. Hodges, Henry<br />\nBogue, G. C. Robinson, Remsen King, E. L.<br />\nPalmer, Knapp, Clarke, Harwood, Peters,<br />\nLazenby, J. Fischer and Fitzgerald, undergraduates; and Messrs. Sioussat, Lyon, Radcliffe, H. V. Black, graduates.<br />\nIt is encouraging to observe that a number<br />\nof graduates and not a few medical students<br />\ntake regular exercise in the gymnasium and<br />\ncage. It is to be hoped that as the advantages<br />\nof this exercise in preventing the lethargy fatal<br />\nto clear-minded study are realized, graduates' interest in athletics will increase still<br />\nfurther.<br />\nMr. E. Emmett Reid, who took his doctor's degree on February 22, has recently published in Self Culture an article on \"The Beginnings of Photography.\" It is a modification of the first chapter of his essay on the<br />\n\"Relation of Chemistry to Photography,\"<br />\nwhich won the prize of Sioo offered to graduate students of this University in 1895.<br />\n<br />\ntan damsel. The sedate Mr. Fooks,in a discussion, replete with abstruse mathematical calculations, endeavored to show that there still<br />\nremained two or three acres for incoming nationalities.<br />\nThere will be but two more meetings of the<br />\nHouse this year. Messrs. Grimes and Guggenheimer of the regulars have been appointed to speak at the next meeting, and are to<br />\nchoose six men to oppose them. The last<br />\nmeeting will be what the Censor termed a<br />\ndress rehearsal.<br />\nSCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION.<br />\n<br />\nLast Thursday's meeting of the Scientific<br />\nAssociation was exceedingly well attended.<br />\nThe subjects treated were, however, somewhat<br />\nabstruse to ordinary mortals. Mr. Waidner,<br />\nfellow in physics, discussed the two rival theories as to the nature of cathode rays\u2014the<br />\nwave theory and the solid particle theory. He<br />\nspoke chiefly of Professor J. J. Thompson's<br />\nwork, and his conclusions were in favor of the<br />\nsolid particle theory. Dr. Ames spoke of<br />\nsome recent work on Roentgen-ray phenomena. He brought out very clearly that we<br />\nmust believe the X ray to be not a regular,<br />\ncontinuous succession of waves in the ether,<br />\nbut simply an irregular succession of very<br />\nthin, quick pulses in the ether. All the observed effects can be explained on this supposition. Professor Stokes of Cambridge proposed the idea some little time ago, and just<br />\nrecently Professor J. J. Thompson, also of<br />\nCambridge, has shown that from certain<br />\nmathematical deductions we are led to expect<br />\njust such a thin, quick pulse. Another remarkable coincidence between theory and experiment which Dr. Ames mentioned is that<br />\npresented by the Tiemann effect\u2014a phenomenon, observed this last summer by a Dutchman named Tiemann, in which a source of<br />\nlight is found to have the character of its emission remarkably changed in the presence of a<br />\nstrong magnetic field. This peculiar phenomenon can be fully explained by an electromagnetic theory of light advanced about fifteen years ago by Lorentz.<br />\n<br />\n\f--%1111111<br />\n<br />\nTHE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL r2R BOYS<br />\nW. 8.

SHR1VER.<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT PATTON'S<br />\nMESSAGE.<br />\nWhen President Patton speaks, it behooves<br />\nevery student to lend an attentive ear, not only<br />\nbecause all that he says is worthy of deepest<br />\nconsideration, but also because if one does not<br />\nlisten closely, one fails to hear almost every<br />\nfifth word. His style, however, is piquant, and<br />\nat times quaint. His premises and conclusions<br />\nare clearly marked, and without doubt he believes what he says. For a man to attempt to<br />\nspeak of Morals and Religion\" in any coherent manner, with all his notes for an hour's<br />\ntalk on a sheet three by four is, forsooth, a<br />\ntask before which even a Presbyterian minister might hesitate. But President Patton not<br />\nonly showed that what he said was the product of deep personal thought, but\u2014what is<br />\nmore essential\u2014he set his hearers to thinking<br />\nfor themselves. His arguments were striking,<br />\nhis conclusions are not lightly to be set aside,<br />\nand the question comes to every sincere man,<br />\n\"How does all this affect. me? How am I to<br /><br />\nNo. xo<br /><br />\nconvert my convictions into actions ?\"<br />\nDr. Patton spoke of \"Moral Obligation,\"<br />\nof \"The Good\" and of \"The Right.\" He<br />\nglanced at the various ethical schools, and<br />\nstruck off many apt comparisons. He showed<br />\nin an incontestable manner that no adequate<br />\nidea of moral obligation can be had until you<br />\nenthrone the Almighty and put a moral Governor above you. 'Tis then, and then only, that<br />\nthe idea of obligation can have any true influence in the amelioration of mankind. We find<br />\nin our nature a powerful tendency to degeneration, and if we are to journey toward perfection there must be not only an external<br />\nstandard whereby our conduct may be judged,<br />\nbut there must be also an equally powerful<br />\nforce impelling us away from our natural tendencies. A standard of infinite good and right<br />\nby which man's finite doings may be counted<br />\ncan come only from a true conception of the<br />\nattributes of an infinite being\u2014a perfect personality. 'Tis in the presence of such conceptions that the edicts of that infinite being will<br />\nfurnish the force necessary to raise man up out<br />\nof the mire of his natural tendencies. The<br />\nedict must get its force from the power of the<br />\npersonality behind it. If you are going to control the personality of man and obtain morality, the law must he given with the thunder of<br />\nMount Sinai, saying: \"Thou shalt not.\"<br />\nSome people would lay aside religion and<br />\nconsider morality as a separate idea. But the<br />\nearthquake that pulls the church down will<br />\nshake with equal force the foundations of the<br />\nethical lecture hall. Take away religion and<br />\nmorals will soon disappear. Albeit that morality is instructive, when once you have removed God you have abolished obligatory<br />\nmorality forever, and all that you have left is<br />\na morality of good form and good taste.<br />\nUnder such conditions, how long, think ye,<br />\nwould this world be a fit dwelling-place for<br />\nthe children of men ?<br />\nPresident Patton omitted any fruitless discussion of \"Determinism\" or \"Libertarianism,\" but insisted equally upon the infinite<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS -LETTER.<br /><br />\nsovereignty of God and upon the free agency<br />\nof man. On nothing else did he lay more<br />\nstress than upon the fact that there can be no<br />\nmoral obligation unless there be a subject of<br />\nthat obligation\u2014free to feel, think and act.<br />\nAll the morality of the universe resolves itself<br />\ninto selfhood \u2014 the power of self-determination. We are not mere machines. It is necessary for us to realize fully that we can act of<br />\nour own accord, even against a prevailing<br />\nhabit. In a man's character nature determines<br />\nmuch, and habit goes on and determines more,<br />\nyet they do not determine all ;<br />\n\" holds its<br />\nown against both. We must have great actions;<br />\nlet us then, as Emerson suggests, make our<br />\nown so. That man reaches the highest pinnacle of character who most truly and fully<br />\ntranslates into actions on this terrestial ball<br />\nthe thoughts of the most high God.<br />\nWe must not avoid facts. We must see that<br />\nthere is a standard by which our actions arc<br />\njudged, and an end to which they will carry<br />\nus, if they be conformed to that standard. The<br />\nstandard is the Right,\" the end the \"Good.\"<br />\nNeither of these ideas is to be made- subordinate to the other. They are co-ordinate, and<br />\nmutually parallel. But what is the \"Good ?\"<br />\nEvery man leans to that which is most desirable to him, and the logical conclusion is that<br />\nthere is something supremely desirable. Some<br />\nseek wealth, because that brings surpassing<br />\ngrandeur, or immunity from toil, they seek a<br />\nsurplus of pleasure.<br />\nHe who tortures his<br />\nmemory with innumerable languages does the<br />\nsame thing in a different way. Both seek happiness, and the result is the same, whether it<br />\ncome from successful shop-keeping or successful word-monging. Is man's destiny, then,<br />\nbut to be happy? If we look only at pleasure,<br />\nwe are unable to distinguish between the<br />\nheaven of the hog and the saint's heaven. The<br />\nhog's manners are to us somewhat unconventional, but,could he speak, would he not reply<br />\nthat he preferred the freedom of his trough to<br />\nthe starched stiffness of our dining-rooms? We<br />\ncannot say that pleasure is the end of life, but<br />\nmust find sonic more rational ground for happiness. The end toward which we strive is<br />\nmoral perfection. In this matter no idea but<br />\none of progress to higher goals can be<br /><br />\nthought of. Drummond says : \"It is only a<br />\ncharacter which is itself developing that can<br />\naid the evolution of the world and so fulfill the<br />\nend of life.\" To such a progress the end must<br />\nbe infinite ; and this is God. So far as we can<br />\nsee, the destiny of every part of everybody is<br />\nto become, by growth and development, a perfect part. Is it not the same for man as a<br />\nwhole ? Self-realization is the \"Good\" to be<br />\nreached. The glory of God, which some consider the chief end of man, is not incompatible<br />\nwith man's self-realization ; on the contrary,<br />\nit is to be reached through self-realization.<br />\nSince man is made in the image of God, and<br />\nGod is perfect, the highest honor that man can<br />\npay to God is earnestly to strive to reach the<br />\nsame perfection.<br />\nIf the ideal is to be of any value, we must<br />\nbelieve it to be attainable ; we must separate it<br />\nfrom the life of this world, and then we must<br />\nconceive another life in which to enjoy it.<br />\nTherefore, if the idea be attainable, and the<br />\nblackness of pessimism is upon those that<br />\nthink not so, there must be God, freedom and<br />\nimmortality. For it cannot be said that character will develop in all its fullness in this life.<br />\nThat were a time far too short for an evolution<br />\nso glorious. We see here only the small green<br />\nblade which hut determines what we ultimately shall be. Ultimately\u2014that is a long<br />\nway off, but not too long to take into reckoning. When the fires of the sun shall have<br />\nburned themselves to ashes, we shall not have<br />\ncompleted our cathedral of character, we shall<br />\nstill be building.<br />\nWill the building last ?<br />\nHear\u2014\" He that doeth the will of God abideth<br />\nforever.\"<br />\nCHARLES KEYSER<br />\nEDMUNDS.<br /><br />\nA LAMENT.<br /><br />\nMy love is fair.

Some good music was played by Renz's<br />\norchestra, conducted by Mr. Edwin L. Turnbull. The impressive chant, \"Benedictus,\"<br />\nsung by Messrs. Robert H. Hughes, David E.<br />\nFrancis, Edwin L. Turnbull and Thomas S.<br />\nBaker, is Mr. Turnbull's own composition.<br />\nRev. J. Eccleston, S. T. D., led the prayer at<br />\nthe opening of the formal exercises. As in<br />\nformer years, we had a celebrated guest as<br />\nmain speaker of the occasion. The Hon.<br />\nCharles Kendall Adams, President of the University of Wisconsin, delivered an address on<br />\nThe Support of Higher Education by the<br />\nState.\" The degree of Ph. D. was conferred<br />\non the following gentlemen :<br />\nCharles William Peppier, A. B., Hopkins,<br />\n1892.<br />\nEbenezer Emmet Reid, A. M., Richmond<br />\nCollege, 1892.<br />\nWilliam Berney Saffold, A. B., University<br />\nof Alabama, 1889.<br />\nThree men received the A. B. degree, viz:<br />\nRobert Ernest Belknap.<br />\nWilliam Cazenove Gardner.<br />\nCharles Smith Lewis.<br />\nCONURESSIONAL DEBATERS.<br /><br />\nContrary to our bold expectations, our representative 'champions seemed rather crestfallen during the last manoeuvre. The brilliant scheme of the rotary turret failed for lack<br />\nof points. The points on the immigration<br />\nquestion, as the reader may remember, were to<br />\nform the steel armor of this novel structure.<br />\nThe general criticised with severe justice the<br />\nbearing of our troops. On the whole, these<br />\nsymptoms gladden the Senate's spirits, as evident signs of final victory. For the very soldiers who wince and bow their heads as the<br />\nfirst shells are humming above them, will<br />\ncoolly face the jaws of death's batteries on the<br />\nday of battle. Whereas premature bravado is<br />\nproverbially common with bad fighting stock.<br />\nBy command of the general, different tactics<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nwill be pursued in the next manoeuvre. Morning exercise, in \"intensity\" will no longer<br />\nbe followed by headache on the field. The<br />\nsoldiers' hands, which are to hurl forensic<br />\nbombs at our enemies, will do execution outside of the trousers pockets. Thus prepared,<br />\nand equipped with stores of ammunition pro<br />\nand con, two champions will surely repel the<br />\nattack of a dozen bush rangers. The council<br />\nof war .will note any dangerous movements<br />\nemployed by the enemy to embody them in<br />\nthe plan for the decisive battle. This plan is<br />\nstrictly secret ; betrayal of any part of it will<br />\nbe regarded as high treason.<br />\nThe members of the House of Representatives who have been appointed for the public<br />\ndebate are actively and energetically preparing themselves for the coming conflict with<br />\nthe Senate. The men are working faithfully,<br />\nand are bent upon corning off victorious on<br />\nthe momentous day of battle. They assemble<br />\nregularly, in order to criticise each other's<br />\nstyle, and to practice extemporaneous speaking. Their efforts toward perfecting themselves in public speaking have so far been<br />\ncrowned with success.<br />\nThe House was agreeably surprised in the<br />\nlast meeting with the change they are undergoing. Messrs. Morgan and French, who<br />\nwere pitted against one-third of the House,<br />\nspoke forcibly and to the point, and showed<br />\nthat they merited the approbation of the Censor. The following plan of debate was pursued : Messrs. Morgan and French presented<br />\nfacts, while the speakers who opposed them<br />\ngave some of the arguments the Senate would<br />\nprobably bring to bear against them. The<br />\nobject was to give the regular speakers most<br />\nof the arguments the Senate could present, so<br />\nthat on the day of contest they would be prepared to refute them.<br />\nSeveral curious arguments were unearthed<br />\nduring the discussion. Mr. Jungbluth seemed<br />\nto think that the vital point of the question<br />\nhinged on the advisability of excluding the<br />\nGerman servant girl. Mr. Fischer, however,<br />\nwas not to be outdone by him, but instantly<br />\ntook the floor in behalf of the buxom Neapoli(Conttnued on page 8.)<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nCjcpetuglAetter.<br />\nPublished Portnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nFEBRUARY 24, 1898.<br />\nSubscription P.5o per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nAssistant Editor in Chief, Consulting Editors, -<br /><br />\nEDGEWORTH SMITH, '98.<br />\nALBERT C.

Nearly everybody with any interest, past or present, in<br />\n\"Torn\" Hopkins, was there to see for himself, and those who stayed away have no doubt<br />\nbeen told often enough how much they<br />\nmissed.<br />\nThe \"feed\" was good and plentiful; the stunt<br />\ngames were all very funny. But the features<br />\nof the evening were the addresses by President<br />\nGilman, Mr. McLane and Mr. Geo. C. Morrison, '90, with which the ceremonies began.<br />\nThey contained many suggestions well deserving our attention. A particularly good example of these is Mr. Morrison's plan for a<br />\n\"Hopkins Country 'Club,\" which has been<br />\nenergetically taken up and promises to give<br />\nsubstantial results. The speakers were also<br />\nearnest in appealing to the students to take advantage of their opportunities. \"The University is doing its duty by you,\" said Mr. Morrison, \"now help yourselves.\" Withal, the<br />\nspeeches were really interesting\u2014not one whit<br />\ntedious. Laughter and applause they received<br />\nin abundance; and they deserved it.<br /><br />\nBefore our next issue the Junior Class will<br />\nhave held its annual class banquet. Or perhaps we should only say\u2014since no future event<br />\nis a certainty, especially a Junior Class banquet<br />\n\u2014will have tried to hold its banquet. In any<br />\ncase, it is not difficult to predict that this occasion will be most fruitful of class feeling and<br />\nthat a large fraction of our undergraduate<br />\nbody will appear at the University next morning with sleeves metaphorically rolled up and<br />\nwith an eye for gore. On the whole, class spirit<br />\nhas this year been so commendably subordinated to University spirit that we cannot fin.d<br />\nit in our hearts to condemn a merely occasional<br />\non<br />\nAs a safety valve for the animal spirits<br />\nof under-class men it is highly commendable<br />\nWe must also make allowance for the extreme<br />\nyouth of some of those who may be among the<br />\nactive participants. \"Boys will be boys,\" as the<br />\nold folks say. And it must be confessed that<br />\nour Freshmen this year seem more than usually unwilling to lay aside childish things. Perhaps they may at any rate save some \"erring\"<br />\nJunior, even against his will, from the evils of<br />\nindigestion or of something worse.<br />\nBut should an encounter result next morning from their well meant missionary efforts<br />\nthe night of the banquet, we urge that they<br />\navoid therein the rude unsympathetic pavement of the McCoy Hall basement.

ADAMS' ADDRESS.<br />\nOn the 18th of February, Professor Adams<br />\ndelivered the Phi Beta Kappa oration at<br />\nWilliam and Mary College on the study and<br />\nteaching of history. Professor Adams was<br />\nespecially welcomed there as a guest since it<br />\nwas largely due to the publication of a monograph by him, that public interest was revived in this old historic landmark on higher<br />\neducation in America. Owing to the serious<br />\nlosses sustained by the college during the<br />\nCivil War, the institution had to be closed.<br />\nIt is rather curious to note, that although all<br />\nwork had ceased entirely, the President, the<br />\nsole survival of the faculty, used to ring the<br />\nold chapel bell at sunrise on the first day of<br />\nthe autumn session each year.<br />\nIt was at,this old institution that the study<br />\nof history and politics was developed and carried on long before the Northern institutions<br />\neven considered such a course. It was here<br />\nthat were trained the Southern statesmen of<br />\nthe old regime\u2014such as John Randolph and<br />\nChief-Justice Marshall.<br />\nProfessor Adams suggested in his monograph that William and Mary be revived as<br />\na training school for statesmen, a West Point,<br />\nas it were, for the development of diplomatists.<br />\nHe urged that such courses of study should be<br />\nfollowed as would prepare men for public life,<br />\nand also for the civil service. Professor<br />\nAdams' rocommendations were never entirely<br />\ncarried out, but his monograph attracted widespread notice. Copies of it were put into the<br />\nhands of the members of the Virginia Legislature, and public pressure was brought to<br />\nbear to such an extent that an appropriation<br />\nwas made for the revival of the college. Since<br />\nits reopening the institution has been doing a<br />\nvaluable work as a normal college; special attention being laid on the training of teachers<br />\nfor the public schools. The students taught<br />\nat public expense\u2014this class includes by far<br />\nthe largest number\u2014are required to teach in<br />\nthe public schools of the State for at least two<br />\nyears. This system has secured for the State<br />\nan efficient corps of public teachers.<br />\nAt the present session of the Legislature, a<br />\nbill was reported favorably which would re-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nduce the annual appropriation from fifteen<br />\nthousand dollars to seven thousand and five<br />\nhundred, on the grounds that the work being<br />\ndone did not justify so large an appropriation.<br />\nThere also seems to be a sentiment current<br />\namong quite a large number of the members<br />\nof the Legislature to do aWay entirely with<br />\nappropriations, and even to confiscate the college buildings and chattels, despite the decision of the United States Supreme Court on<br />\nthe famous Dartmouth College case, declaring<br />\nthe invalidity of such a course. It is to be<br />\nhoped that such unjust measures will not be<br />\nemployed. William and Mary's record in the<br />\npast has earned for it the financial and moral<br />\nsupport of the State.<br />\nIt seems only right that those collegiate institutions which have contributed to the intellectual, and even the material progress of a<br />\nState, should not be allowed to suffer from neglect and ingratitude in times of adversity.<br />\nThe Maryland Legislature would also do well<br />\nto take it to heart that those institutions within<br />\nthe State which have so ably stood for higher<br />\neducation\u2014yes, so ably that Maryland and<br />\nBaltimore have become much more widely<br />\nknown and famous for being the seat of<br />\nthem\u2014should not have their future operations<br />\ncramped and retarded by unfortunate unforeseen financial troubles.<br />\nProfessor Adams was delighted with his<br />\ntrip. While there, he was initiated into the<br />\nmysteries of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. It<br />\nis interesting to note that this society\u2014the<br />\noldest of its kind in America\u2014was founded at<br />\nWilliam and Mary in 1776.<br /><br />\nThe third of the series of Hopkins' musicales<br />\ntook place on February 12th. The programme<br />\nwas well chosen, and a quintet by Doorak for<br />\npiano and strings was in particular well rendered. Miss Pagon's singing was also good.<br />\nA number of people stayed to the reception<br />\nafterwards.<br />\nDr. E. W. Sikes, Ph.

In the lockerroom, which is heated from above, the cement<br />\nfloor is always cold. When the bare-footed<br />\ngymnast first steps on it he is chilled suddenly<br />\nand from this several have already caught<br />\ncolds. Strips of coarse matting spread before<br />\nthe lockers would not be expensive, and would<br />\ndo much to remedy the evil.<br /><br />\nATHLETIC rlISCELLANY.<br /><br />\nArrangements have been made for putting<br />\na track in the cage. The track is to be a cinder<br />\none, built under the guidance of Mr. Mackdermott, whose experience in this line is invaluable. The track will be a most welcome<br />\naddition to the cage, especially in view of the<br />\nfact that many of the runners are now complaining of twisted ankles and sore muscles,<br />\ncaused by the very uneven ground and sharp<br />\ncurves of the cage.<br />\nThe hockey team's trip to Philadelphia failed<br />\nto result in any victory for the Black and Blue.<br />\nThe men, nevertheless, made a very good<br />\nshowing when it is considered that over half<br />\nthe regular men were laid up. The first game<br />\nwith the strong University of Pennsylvania<br />\nteam was very close, and the second game<br />\nwhich was more one-sided, was played almost<br />\nentirely with scrubs.<br />\nProfessor Doyle of the Baltimore Athletic<br />\nClub will today begin instructing the students<br />\nin the art of wrestling. We may justly expect<br />\nto develop some clever wrestlers under the<br />\nexperienced, scientific care of Professor<br />\nDoyle.<br />\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays classes in fencing will be held.<br />\nThe classes in gymnasium work have become so large that Dr. Crenshaw is obliged to<br />\nhave two assistants to aid him in instructing<br />\nthe many new students. The assistants are<br />\nvery capable men, two of the best gymnasts of<br />\nthe Turnverein Vorwaerts. This extensive<br />\ninterest in gymnasium work proper is very<br />\ngratifying, and will surely develop many<br />\n\"dark horses.\"<br />\nMr. T. F. P. Cameron,'94, and Mr. F. Lupton, Medical School, are daily to he seen playing lacrosse in the cage. Their presence is<br />\nespecially effective in stimulating the new material.<br />\nMr. Murkland, who recently broke his ankle<br />\nin the cage, is rapidly convalescing, and, it is<br />\nhoped, will be back at the University very<br />\nsoon.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nrIEDICAL SCHOOL NOTES.<br /><br />\nMuch interest is manifested throughout the<br />\nMedical School in regard ,to the anti-vivisection bill now pending before the Senate of the<br />\nUnited States. *While this bill would not directly affect the work here, it is feared that its<br />\npassage would exert great influence upon the<br />\nMaryland Legislature to pass a similar bill. A<br />\npetition has been presented in the Senate by<br />\nSenator Gorman, signed by the deans of all<br />\nthe medical schools in the city, and by other<br />\nprominent men, including President Gilman<br />\nand Dr. Osier, praying against the passage of<br />\nthe bill.<br />\nIn the number of the Journal of the American Medical Association for February 5 Dr.<br />\nWelch has p'ublished a long article clearly setting forth the arguments against the bill, and<br />\nupholding the value of vivisection as it is<br />\npracticed in the leading universities, medical<br />\nschools and experimental laboratories in the<br />\ncountry. It is the best argument for animal<br />\nexperimentation published in some time, and<br />\nshould be read by all interested in the subject.<br />\nThe course in forensic medicine given by Dr.<br />\nRobert Fletcher of Washington, D. C., and intended for the members of the two upper<br />\nclasses, will begin in the amphitheatre on Friday, February 25.<br />\nMembers of the first year are building many<br />\nair castles as regards the new physiological<br />\nbuilding to be erected on the vacant ground,<br />\ncorner of Washington and Monument streets,<br />\nbut it seems doubtful if it will be finished in<br />\ntime for the usual Fall work. When completed, it will be very convenient, and will<br />\nsave much valuable time now lost in the trip<br />\nacross town to the University, to attend the<br />\nlectures in physiology,<br />\nMr. William R. Dancey of the second year<br />\nwho has been sick in the hospital for some<br />\ntime, is. now convalescent.<br />\nDuring the hockey game on Tuesday, February 8, Mr. Joseph T. Butler of the first year<br /><br />\nwas painfully hurt by having his foot badly<br />\ncut with an adversary's skate. He sustained<br />\na compound fracture of the first phalanx of<br />\nthe fourth toe, but aside from the inconvenience of having to go about on crutches, he is<br />\nnow doing nicely.<br />\nDr. Barker's lectures on the nervous system<br />\nhave begun in the course in histology for the<br />\nfirst-year students. These lectures are particularly fine, and are,' as usual, attended by<br />\nmany members of the upper classes as well.<br /><br />\n\u2022 Y.<br /><br />\nC. A.

Routine business<br />\nwas transacted.<br />\nThe General-Secretary, Mr. Barr, was<br />\nchosen to represent the association at the Student Volunteer Convention to be held at Cleveland, Ohio,in a few weeks.

The alarm was turned in\u2014the fire<br />\ndepartment attended to the water. Uncle<br />\nDaniel serenely drank his coffee and came<br />\ndown punctually to his business at J. H. U.<br />\nWe are pleased that no serious damage was<br />\ndone to his home.<br />\nA society, whose members are drawn from<br />\nthe graduate departments, medical school and<br />\nSenior and Junior undergraduate classes, has<br />\nbeen recently formed. The club is for social<br />\npurposes, and election to membership in it is<br />\nintended as an honor for those who have done<br />\ngood work for the University. It has adopted<br />\nthe colors of the University and bears on its<br />\npin the letter \"U\" with a smaller Greek \"delta\"<br />\non each side, and a hand with the forefingers<br />\npointing upward. The present list of members is: Messrs. Clunet, Dieffenbach, V. E.<br />\nSmith, Grimes, Levering, C. Hodges, Henry<br />\nBogue, G. C. Robinson, Remsen King, E. L.<br />\nPalmer, Knapp, Clarke, Harwood, Peters,<br />\nLazenby, J. Fischer and Fitzgerald, undergraduates; and Messrs. Sioussat, Lyon, Radcliffe, H. V. Black, graduates.<br />\nIt is encouraging to observe that a number<br />\nof graduates and not a few medical students<br />\ntake regular exercise in the gymnasium and<br />\ncage. It is to be hoped that as the advantages<br />\nof this exercise in preventing the lethargy fatal<br />\nto clear-minded study are realized, graduates' interest in athletics will increase still<br />\nfurther.<br />\nMr. E. Emmett Reid, who took his doctor's degree on February 22, has recently published in Self Culture an article on \"The Beginnings of Photography.\" It is a modification of the first chapter of his essay on the<br />\n\"Relation of Chemistry to Photography,\"<br />\nwhich won the prize of Sioo offered to graduate students of this University in 1895.<br /><br />\ntan damsel. The sedate Mr. Fooks,in a discussion, replete with abstruse mathematical calculations, endeavored to show that there still<br />\nremained two or three acres for incoming nationalities.<br />\nThere will be but two more meetings of the<br />\nHouse this year. Messrs. Grimes and Guggenheimer of the regulars have been appointed to speak at the next meeting, and are to<br />\nchoose six men to oppose them. The last<br />\nmeeting will be what the Censor termed a<br />\ndress rehearsal.<br />\nSCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION.<br /><br />\nLast Thursday's meeting of the Scientific<br />\nAssociation was exceedingly well attended.<br />\nThe subjects treated were, however, somewhat<br />\nabstruse to ordinary mortals. Mr. Waidner,<br />\nfellow in physics, discussed the two rival theories as to the nature of cathode rays\u2014the<br />\nwave theory and the solid particle theory. He<br />\nspoke chiefly of Professor J. J. Thompson's<br />\nwork, and his conclusions were in favor of the<br />\nsolid particle theory. Dr. Ames spoke of<br />\nsome recent work on Roentgen-ray phenomena. He brought out very clearly that we<br />\nmust believe the X ray to be not a regular,<br />\ncontinuous succession of waves in the ether,<br />\nbut simply an irregular succession of very<br />\nthin, quick pulses in the ether. All the observed effects can be explained on this supposition. Professor Stokes of Cambridge proposed the idea some little time ago, and just<br />\nrecently Professor J. J. Thompson, also of<br />\nCambridge, has shown that from certain<br />\nmathematical deductions we are led to expect<br />\njust such a thin, quick pulse. Another remarkable coincidence between theory and experiment which Dr. Ames mentioned is that<br />\npresented by the Tiemann effect\u2014a phenomenon, observed this last summer by a Dutchman named Tiemann, in which a source of<br />\nlight is found to have the character of its emission remarkably changed in the presence of a<br />\nstrong magnetic field. This peculiar phenomenon can be fully explained by an electromagnetic theory of light advanced about fifteen years ago by Lorentz.<br /><br />\n--%1111111<br /><br />\nTHE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL r2R BOYS<br />\nW. 8.
