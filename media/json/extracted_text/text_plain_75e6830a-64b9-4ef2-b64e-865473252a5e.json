It is of oustanding<br />\nimportance in American history, since it marked the ending of General<br />\nRobert E. Lee\u2019s first invasion of the North, thereby postponing indefi-<br />\nnitely England\u2019s threatened recognition of the Confederacy and giving<br />\nPresident Lincoln the opportunity to issue his Emancipation Proclama-<br />\ntion. The neighboring Antietam National Cemetery is also under the<br />\nadministration of the National Park Service, since it is part of the historic<br />\nground over which the battle was fought. It is the burial place of Federal<br />\ndead from the battles of Antietam, South Mountain, and minor engage-<br />\nments of the region. A library and small museum, located in the adminis-<br />\ntration building at the entrance to the National Cemetery, are available<br />\nfor the use of visitors. Organizations and groups of visitors will be given<br />\nspecial service if arrangements are made in advance with the superin-<br />\ntendent.

When dawn broke he saw the American flag still flying, and<br />\nwas moved to write the verses of our national anthem. The fort is a fine<br />\nexample of late 18th century military architecture, with bastions forming<br />\na five-pointed star.<br />\n<br />\nFort McHenry is open to the public daily throughout the year, including<br />\nSundays, from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The museum buildings are open<br />\nbetween 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. An admission fee of 10 cents is charged to<br />\nvisitors more than 16 years of age, except that members of school groups<br />\nup to 18 years of age are admitted free.

This old waterway, one of the least altered<br />\nof the older American canals, is an example of the ever-improvirig means<br />\nof transportation that helped to bind the Nation together. Through the<br />\nnatural passageway to the West afforded by the Potomac River Valley<br />\nhave passed the Indian trail, colonial wagon road, canal, railroad, tele-<br />\ngraph and telephone, and the modern superhighway. By these constantly<br />\nimproving modes of communication the once widely separated eastern<br />\nand western regions of the fast-growing Union were firmly linked both<br />\nsocially and commercially. Twenty-two miles of the old canal, between<br />\nGeorgetown, D. C., and Seneca, Maryland, have been restored by the<br />\nNational Park Service. Specially conducted tours via an old-time mule-<br />\ndrawn barge are available on the canal during the summer months.<br />\nCanoeing, boating, hiking, fishing, picnicking, nature walks, and ice<br />\nskating are among the recreational opportunities. Canoes and rowboats<br />\nmay be rented at Great Falls; and privately owned canoes are permitted<br />\non the canal.

Erected in<br />\n1783-90, Hampton represents the height of opulence in the moment<br />\njust between the end of the Revolution and the adoption of the<br />\nFederal Constitution. Hampton is operated as a national historic<br />\nsite by the Society for the Preservation of Maryland Antiquities<br />\nunder a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service.

It is of oustanding<br />\nimportance in American history, since it marked the ending of General<br />\nRobert E. Lee\u2019s first invasion of the North, thereby postponing indefi-<br />\nnitely England\u2019s threatened recognition of the Confederacy and giving<br />\nPresident Lincoln the opportunity to issue his Emancipation Proclama-<br />\ntion. The neighboring Antietam National Cemetery is also under the<br />\nadministration of the National Park Service, since it is part of the historic<br />\nground over which the battle was fought. It is the burial place of Federal<br />\ndead from the battles of Antietam, South Mountain, and minor engage-<br />\nments of the region. A library and small museum, located in the adminis-<br />\ntration building at the entrance to the National Cemetery, are available<br />\nfor the use of visitors.

This old waterway, one of the least altered<br />\nof the older American canals, is an example of the ever-improvirig means<br />\nof transportation that helped to bind the Nation together. Through the<br />\nnatural passageway to the West afforded by the Potomac River Valley<br />\nhave passed the Indian trail, colonial wagon road, canal, railroad, tele-<br />\ngraph and telephone, and the modern superhighway. By these constantly<br />\nimproving modes of communication the once widely separated eastern<br />\nand western regions of the fast-growing Union were firmly linked both<br />\nsocially and commercially. Twenty-two miles of the old canal, between<br />\nGeorgetown, D. C., and Seneca, Maryland, have been restored by the<br />\nNational Park Service. Specially conducted tours via an old-time mule-<br />\ndrawn barge are available on the canal during the summer months.<br />\nCanoeing, boating, hiking, fishing, picnicking, nature walks, and ice<br />\nskating are among the recreational opportunities. Canoes and rowboats<br />\nmay be rented at Great Falls; and privately owned canoes are permitted<br />\non the canal.
