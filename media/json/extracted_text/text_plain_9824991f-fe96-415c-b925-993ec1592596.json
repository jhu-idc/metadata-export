The<br />\nregular game ended in a tie, 22-all.<br />\nIn the extra period the Jesuits drew<br />\naway from the frantic Jays and won,<br />\n27 to 24.<br />\nBoth teams were apparently tense<br />\nand excited as the fray opened. Close<br />\ndefense systems made shooting opportunities few and far between. For<br />\nthe greater part of the period the<br />\nJays and Jesuits alternately held onepoint leads. Then the Evergreen stalwarts began to locate the rim from<br />\nlong range and were six points ahead<br />\nat half-time. Throughout this period Harry Woodrow performed brilliantly for the Darleymen.<br />\nJays Rally<br />\nAs the second canto opened, the<br />\nLoyola team added to its lead. Victory seemed certain for the Jesuits.<br />\nThe Jays, with their backs to the<br />\nwall, staged an infuriated comeback.<br />\nSiegel tallied first and in rapid succession Chancellor accounted for two<br />\nmore baskets. Two long hawkers by<br />\nCaptain Siverd knotted the count as<br />\nthe final gun sounded.<br />\nAmid the sustained uproar of the<br />\nfans, it was decided to play a fiveminute extra period. Too anxious to<br />\nscore, the Jays were erratic in their<br />\nshooting. The Greyhounds, however,<br />\nsettled down immediately. Taneyhill<br />\npushed a rebound into the basket to<br />\nplace Loyola ahead. Soon after Colvin converted a foul. Wayson's basket clinched the game for the Jesuits.<br />\nSiegel made the only Hopkins tally<br />\nin this period.<br />\nIn a preliminary encounter, the Jay<br />\nfreshmen defeated the Loyola yearlings, 20 to 11. Kempton, Tragis, and<br />\nRosenthal were outstanding for the<br />\nfrosh.<br />\n<br />\nWhen Cliff Siverd said to Referee<br />\nJack Enright, \"How about giving us<br />\na break?\" Loyola was awarded a<br />\ntechnical foul which it converted into<br />\na point.. Were it not for that, Hopkins might have won, 22-21, in the<br />\nregular playing time. The quality of<br />\nthe officiating still does not excuse<br />\nthe childish attitude of the stands.<br />\nOpposition players, who have nothing<br />\nto do with the way the referee sees<br />\nthe play, should be given a fair<br />\nchance to sink their foul shots.<br />\nHarry Woodrow looked like allstate material for fifteen minutes in<br />\nthe first half. Carl Rasin, injured in<br />\npractice, was obviously not himself.<br />\nCliff Siverd gave further demonstration that there is no one in the league<br />\nwho can anticipate and Intercept<br />\npasses better than he. Herbie Siegel<br />\nholds the record for spills. Opie Chancellor holds the record for fouls. He<br />\nmust think there is a referees' conspiracy against him.<br />\nTo cap it all, Loyola, leading the<br />\nleague, isn't as good a five as Mt.
