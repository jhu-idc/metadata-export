Of primary<br />\nimportance in the successful<br />\nfunctioning of the System is a<br />\nthorough understanding of each<br />\nindividual's personal responsibility under it. There are some who<br />\nwould like to think that this re-<br />\n<br />\nsponsibility does not include the<br />\nreporting of possible violations of<br />\nothers to the Commission.<br />\nThey argue that responsibility<br />\nwith respect to honor lies completely within one's self, and does<br />\nnot extend to concern with the<br />\nmoral codes of others. Essentially, this is a valid position, but it<br />\nfails to consider one very important point\u2014that the success<br />\nand maintenance of the System<br />\ndepends upon its principles being followed by all.

Essentially, this is a valid position, but it<br />\nfails to consider one very important point\u2014that the success<br />\nand maintenance of the System<br />\ndepends upon its principles being followed by all.
