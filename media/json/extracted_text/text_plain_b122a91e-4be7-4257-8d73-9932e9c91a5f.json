Mr. Keyser<br />\nwill be remembered as a leader of the University, and as one of<br />\nits greatest benefactors.<br />\nAs president of the board of trustees, he gave twenty-three<br />\nyears of constructive service. His greatest single achievement in<br />\nthis period was the removal of the University to Homewood, a<br />\nmovement in which he was the leader, and which was brought<br />\nabout largely through his efforts.
