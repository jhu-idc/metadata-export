Next September's entering<br />\nclass will probably approximate<br />\n400. In that same period, however, applications have almost<br />\ndoubled. In 1957-58, high school<br />\nseniors sent 1184 applications in<br />\nthe direction of Hopkins; in<br />\n1958-59, 1524 applications; in<br />\n1959-60, 1829; and the final count<br />\nfor 1960-61 will reach about<br />\n2100.<br />\nThus, Hopkins freshman population remain approximately<br />\nthe same, though three hundred<br />\nmore students each year attempt to gain admission.<br />\nThis three-year survey of admissions also reveais a paradox,<br />\n<br />\nboth in the nationwide admissios picture and in that of Hopkins. Up till three years ago, the<br />\nnumber of engineers was keeping<br />\npace with that of other groups;<br />\n<br />\nROBERT BILGRAVE<br />\n<br />\ntwo years ago, however, there<br />\nwas a 7% increase in freshmen<br />\nthroughout the nation; at the<br />\nsame time there was about an<br />\n11% decrease in engineers. Last<br />\nyear there was a 5% increase in<br />\nover-all students; in engineering, a 4% decrease.<br />\nAt Hopkins, this has meant<br />\nthat the number of students applying and indicating a interest<br />\nin engineering has remained<br />\nabout the same the last couple of<br />\nyears (April, 1959-376; April<br />\n1960-380) whereas as applicants<br />\nin all other fields have shown a<br />\nmarked increase. The greatest<br />\npercentage increase in applications has come from students<br />\nshowing an interest in the humanities and the social sciences.<br />\nThis reflects Dr. Milton Eisenhowers acknowledged desire to<br />\nsee Hopkins get more and better<br />\nstudents in thee fields; and the<br />\nsuccess of the Public Relations<br />\nOffice's Weekly Newspaper column.<br />\n<br />\nWhy has engineering seemingly declined? Bilgrave cited three<br />\nfactors: (1) all the adverse publicity given engineering in regard<br />\nto opportunity and advancement; (2) other areas, particularly the physical sciences, are<br />\nbecoming more attractive to the<br />\nboy who would normally apply.<br />\nfor engineering; and (3) the<br />\ngeneral stiffening of the engineering curriculum. At Hopkins<br />\nthis last factor has been exemplified by the requirement that<br />\nengineers carry three electives<br />\nalong with their usual math and<br />\nscience Courses.<br />\nReturning to the question of<br />\nincreased difficulty in getting admitted into Hopkins, Bilgrave<br />\nnoted that in the past, a boy's<br />\nbeing chosen by Hopkins rested<br />\nupon whether or not he was admissible; now, all the people who<br />\napply to Hopkins are admissible,<br />\nand the admission officer must<br />\nselect the most qualified from a<br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br />\n<br />\nRichard Bass accused the Student Activities Commission this<br />\nweek of \"prejudice,\" \"demagoguery,\" and \"playing politics\" in<br />\nbypassing him in its selection of<br />\nSAC officers.<br />\nBass has been on the SAC for<br />\nthe past year as a Junior member.

But a<br />\ndepartment is not needed to<br />\nbring a fine drama group to the<br />\ncampus.

His speed in following up retiring<br />\nPresident Bill DeVoe's suggestions on improving university assemblies gives reason to believe he is sincerely interested in compiling a good record in his office. With<br />\nthis in mind, we direct his attention to a number of matters demanding immediate action.<br />\n(1) Richard Bass, ex-SAC member, has laid down<br />\ncharges based on the actions of the Student Activities<br />\nCommission, which all seem to point to the existence of<br />\na state of affairs in a vital organization that calls for<br />\nimmediate investigation. Amidst labels of \"prejudice,\"<br />\n\"demagoguery,\" and \"politics,\" we can only get a picture<br />\nthat something is wrong\u2014definitely wrong.<br />\nAny organization that has as one of its main functions passing judgment on the individuals who seek to<br />\nbe leaders, and reviewing a student's capabilities for<br />\nleadership, must definitely be above reproach, and beyond<br />\nthe influence of the many campus factions, groups, and<br />\norganizations.<br />\nThe Student Council shoula determine whether or not<br />\nBass' allegations are correct. Hopkins could be faced<br />\nwith a faultering of one of its most important and responsible organizations.

Next September's entering<br />\nclass will probably approximate<br />\n400. In that same period, however, applications have almost<br />\ndoubled. In 1957-58, high school<br />\nseniors sent 1184 applications in<br />\nthe direction of Hopkins; in<br />\n1958-59, 1524 applications; in<br />\n1959-60, 1829; and the final count<br />\nfor 1960-61 will reach about<br />\n2100.<br />\nThus, Hopkins freshman population remain approximately<br />\nthe same, though three hundred<br />\nmore students each year attempt to gain admission.<br />\nThis three-year survey of admissions also reveais a paradox,<br /><br />\nboth in the nationwide admissios picture and in that of Hopkins. Up till three years ago, the<br />\nnumber of engineers was keeping<br />\npace with that of other groups;<br /><br />\nROBERT BILGRAVE<br /><br />\ntwo years ago, however, there<br />\nwas a 7% increase in freshmen<br />\nthroughout the nation; at the<br />\nsame time there was about an<br />\n11% decrease in engineers. Last<br />\nyear there was a 5% increase in<br />\nover-all students; in engineering, a 4% decrease.<br />\nAt Hopkins, this has meant<br />\nthat the number of students applying and indicating a interest<br />\nin engineering has remained<br />\nabout the same the last couple of<br />\nyears (April, 1959-376; April<br />\n1960-380) whereas as applicants<br />\nin all other fields have shown a<br />\nmarked increase. The greatest<br />\npercentage increase in applications has come from students<br />\nshowing an interest in the humanities and the social sciences.<br />\nThis reflects Dr. Milton Eisenhowers acknowledged desire to<br />\nsee Hopkins get more and better<br />\nstudents in thee fields; and the<br />\nsuccess of the Public Relations<br />\nOffice's Weekly Newspaper column.<br /><br />\nWhy has engineering seemingly declined? Bilgrave cited three<br />\nfactors: (1) all the adverse publicity given engineering in regard<br />\nto opportunity and advancement; (2) other areas, particularly the physical sciences, are<br />\nbecoming more attractive to the<br />\nboy who would normally apply.<br />\nfor engineering; and (3) the<br />\ngeneral stiffening of the engineering curriculum. At Hopkins<br />\nthis last factor has been exemplified by the requirement that<br />\nengineers carry three electives<br />\nalong with their usual math and<br />\nscience Courses.<br />\nReturning to the question of<br />\nincreased difficulty in getting admitted into Hopkins, Bilgrave<br />\nnoted that in the past, a boy's<br />\nbeing chosen by Hopkins rested<br />\nupon whether or not he was admissible; now, all the people who<br />\napply to Hopkins are admissible,<br />\nand the admission officer must<br />\nselect the most qualified from a<br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br /><br />\nRichard Bass accused the Student Activities Commission this<br />\nweek of \"prejudice,\" \"demagoguery,\" and \"playing politics\" in<br />\nbypassing him in its selection of<br />\nSAC officers.<br />\nBass has been on the SAC for<br />\nthe past year as a Junior member.

Meyers<br /><br />\nDave Adams sits in the chair of Student Council<br />\nPresident this week. His speed in following up retiring<br />\nPresident Bill DeVoe's suggestions on improving university assemblies gives reason to believe he is sincerely interested in compiling a good record in his office. With<br />\nthis in mind, we direct his attention to a number of matters demanding immediate action.<br />\n(1) Richard Bass, ex-SAC member, has laid down<br />\ncharges based on the actions of the Student Activities<br />\nCommission, which all seem to point to the existence of<br />\na state of affairs in a vital organization that calls for<br />\nimmediate investigation. Amidst labels of \"prejudice,\"<br />\n\"demagoguery,\" and \"politics,\" we can only get a picture<br />\nthat something is wrong\u2014definitely wrong.<br />\nAny organization that has as one of its main functions passing judgment on the individuals who seek to<br />\nbe leaders, and reviewing a student's capabilities for<br />\nleadership, must definitely be above reproach, and beyond<br />\nthe influence of the many campus factions, groups, and<br />\norganizations.<br />\nThe Student Council shoula determine whether or not<br />\nBass' allegations are correct. Hopkins could be faced<br />\nwith a faultering of one of its most important and responsible organizations. It behooves the Student Council to take a deeper look into the SAC (one of its own<br />\ncommittees) and make sure it is acting and behaving as<br />\nbefits an organization of its stature.<br />\n(2) Of the programs originating under the administration of Bill DeVoe the one which promises more longUpset<br />\nrun benefits than any other is that of Goucher-Hopkins<br />\nDear Sirs:<br />\ncoordination.

How can a<br />\ngroup which takes the news of<br />\na llama's running for the presidency of that group seriously,<br />\nbe revered by the student.s? Not<br />\nonly did they take it seriously,<br />\nbut they pompously announced<br />\nthat all ballots marked with the<br />\nllama's name would be thrown<br />\nout. On the same ballot, they<br />\nthrew in a resolution giving<br />\nthem more control over the nonacademic activities of their Socalled charges \u2014 the Hopkins<br />\nundergrad.
