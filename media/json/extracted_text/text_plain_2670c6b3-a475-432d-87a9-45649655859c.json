He<br />\nnoted a clear health risk to the<br />\npublic who consumes grapes.<br />\nChavez is turning to the public<br />\nfor boycotting as a last resort after<br />\nmany failed, attempts to have<br />\ngovernment authorities in<br />\nCalifornia pass legislation that<br />\nwould ban the use of pesticides<br />\non the fields.

In the past, Chavez's<br />\nboycott rallies have been successful in having legislation<br />\n<br />\npassed that inhibited the use of<br />\ncertain pesticides, such as DDT,<br />\non grape fields and workers.<br />\nHowever, that was a shortlived success. After Governor<br />\nGeorge Dukemajen became<br />\ngovernor of California, he<br />\nrestrained the enforcement of<br />\nlegislation preventing the use of<br />\npesticides on California fields.<br />\nChavez attributed this in part to<br />\nthe fact that Governor Deukmajen's election campaign was<br />\nlargely paid for by the grape<br />\nowners of California and their<br />\nsupportive groups.<br />\nDespite such powerful political<br />\nopposition, Chavez said that the<br />\ngrape boycott would only have to<br />\ninfluence nine percent of the consumers in order to have the grape<br />\nowners turn an open ear to the<br />\npeople and reconsider their use of<br />\npesticides on California fields, as<br />\nopposed to an unattainable fiftyone percent majority vote in the<br />\nCalifornia houses of legislature.<br />\n\"The solution is simple,\" said<br />\nChavez, \"every time you go to<br />\nthe market don't buy any<br />\ngrapes\u2014you're voting.

Early last year, when<br />\nthe recycling project took off,<br />\nnewspaper was a big hit, Guiles<br />\nsaid. The system at Hopkins,<br />\nhowever, was incapable of handling the influx of newspaper.<br />\nGuiles said that newspaper<br />\nremoval cost $15 per ton plus a<br />\n\"tremendous\" number of man<br />\nhours, which hampered the<br />\nrecycling project as a whole.<br />\n\"The American public is consuming newspaper at a rate which<br />\ncannot be recycled,\" said Guiles,<br />\nadding that \"We didn't have<br />\nanything to support the structure.\" As a result, newspaper<br />\nrecycling at Hopkins was<br />\nabandoned.<br />\nAlthough Guiles said that he<br />\nand his co-workers posted signs<br />\nannouncing the elimination of<br />\nnewspaper recycling, people continued to place newspapers in the<br />\nrecycling bins and in the shed<br />\nbehind AMR I.

Berry focused on<br />\nthe inclusion of minority perspectives in the college curriculum, an<br />\nissue addressed in the previous<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nMany students and educators<br />\nacross the country, Berry said,<br />\nfeel that it would make a big difference in the relations of minority college students if the curriculums of America's colleges<br />\ntried to attack what they see as<br />\nwidespread ignorance of other<br />\ncultures. The problem with most<br />\ncurrent curriculums, they argue,<br />\nis that they are \"Eurocentric.\"<br />\nThey contend that if the,contribu-<br />\n<br />\ntions of all peoples are recognized, and not just those of European<br />\nculture, then minorities could feel<br />\nmore self-esteem. They prescribe<br />\n\"mandatory cultural awareness.\"<br />\nAt the first HRCD discussion,<br />\nModeste said that, although there<br />\nare no core requirements, there<br />\nare certain courses that a large<br />\nnumber of the student body at the<br />\nUniversity enroll in, such as<br />\nPractical Composition or Contemporary American Letters. To<br />\nargue against a mandatory<br />\nmulticultural curriculum on the<br />\ngrounds that Hopkins traditionally does not have requirements,<br />\nwould be futile, she said.<br />\nThe HRCD will be sponsoring<br />\nseveral more events this semester<br />\nto promote awareness of the concerns of minority students, including special programs on biased language, Gay and Lesbian<br />\nstudents, Chinese-American<br />\nstudents, and Jewish students.<br />\n<br />\nDepartments to Face<br />\nLittle Growth in Size<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\n\"So far,\" he added, \"the<br />\nresults have been very good.\"<br />\nOn the matter of class sizes and<br />\nthe limited number of courses offered at Hopkins, Richardson was<br />\ninterested in what students had to<br />\nsay. He said that he has been concerned with the decreasing<br />\nnumber of undergraduate faculty.<br />\n\"The size of the departments<br />\nhere at Hopkins strike me as being very small. It seems that is a<br />\nfunction of a conscious decision<br />\nby the University to stay small.<br />\nThe number of classes and<br />\nbreadth of curricula must be<br />\nreviewed and changed. However,<br />\nI think we'll see little growth in<br />\nthe size of departments overall.\"<br />\nRichardson had little to say on<br />\nthe subject of a student union,<br />\nalthough he was aware that the<br />\nissue lies close to students' hearts.<br />\n\"We need intramural athletic<br />\nfacilities and a large student<br />\nunion, but those plans are only in<br />\nthe future.

But<br />\nthen, Miranda had been unhappy<br />\nfor the last few weeks, and it was<br />\nnothing new to her. She hadn't<br />\nheard from David in weeks, Zack<br />\nseemed to be avoiding her, and<br />\nDoris didn't seem to be avoiding<br />\nher. What else, she thotight,<br />\ncould go wrong?<br />\nAs soon as she thought it,<br />\nthough, she realized what a karmically stupid thing that was to<br />\nthink. The easiest way to have<br />\nthings go wrong is to think that<br />\nthere's no way they can.<br />\nSo Miranda wasn't that surprised when Doris pushed aside<br />\nthe curtain and walked into her<br />\nroom.<br />\n\"Time to talk, Miranda,\"<br />\nDoris said, with an odd note of<br />\nseriousness in her voice.<br />\n\"Yes?\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"I'm sick and tired of you sitting around here moping all day.<br />\nYou need to get out more.\"<br />\nMiranda realized with horror<br />\nthat Doris was telling her to get<br />\nout more. Something must be<br />\nwrong.<br />\n\"You know you upset Zack by<br />\nkicking him out?\"<br />\n\"He doesn't live here, Doris.\"<br />\n\"And you never even asked me<br />\nabout Chris?\"<br />\nMiranda bit. \"What about<br />\nChris?\" she said.<br />\nDoris' whole demeanor changed. Gone was the serious, stern<br />\nlook of a normal human being; it<br />\nwas replaced by the look of a person who wants to talk about sex.<br />\nMiranda knew the look from<br />\nthe long nights she, Doris, and<br />\nCarol had spent back in the<br />\ndorms, reliving the slumber parties that cast their shadow over in<br />\njunior high school and dormitories. Carol would talk for<br />\nhours about her past sexual experiences(including the ones that<br />\nshe never really had but fit into<br />\nthe discussion well enough),<br />\nDoris would talk about<br />\nnewscasters that she lusted after,<br />\nand Miranda would talk only<br />\nwhen spoken to.<br />\n<br />\nIt was a wonderful time, and<br />\nMiranda might have looked too<br />\nfondly upon it when choosing<br />\nwho she wanted to have leaving<br />\ndishes in her sink.<br />\nHowever, while Miranda's<br />\nbrain sat in the cheese casserole<br />\npan in the sink, Doris' was running overtime telling Miranda all<br />\n<br />\nIn which Zack goes<br />\nhouse hunting, Miranda<br />\ngoes along, and Doris<br />\nrecalls her sexual tryst<br />\n<br />\nabout her new relationship, emphasizing the aspects that occurred without underwear.<br />\nJust as Doris had begun to tell<br />\nher about how Chris wore his red<br />\nargyles throughout the whole experience, Miranda was saved by<br />\nthe bell.<br />\nDoris answered it. It was Zack.<br />\nPerhaps saved wasn't the right<br />\ncliche.<br />\n\"Hey, Doris,\" Zack muttered.<br />\n\"You ready?\"<br />\n\"Ready?\"<br />\n\"To look for my apartment?\"<br />\n\"Oh. Right.\" Doris looked<br />\nback at Miranda with a look that<br />\nsaid 'if you don't come with us<br />\nto do this, that cheese casserole<br />\ndish will be growing more things<br />\nin it than the meat loaf dish<br />\nit.' Miranda<br />\nunderneath<br />\nunderstood the sentiment enough<br />\nto ask if she could come along.<br />\n\"Sure, why not,\" Zack<br />\nmuttered.<br />\nThe first place Zack stopped<br />\nwas a rowhouse about two blocks<br />\naway from where Miranda lived.<br />\nThe front door(or rather, the second half of the front door\u2014the<br />\nfirst half was conspicuously absent) sat half on its hinges, and<br />\nthere was a strange man sitting in<br />\nfront of it muttering something<br />\nabout pod people.<br />\nZack was beaming at it.<br />\n\"You Zack?\" a burly old man<br />\nContinued on page 15<br />\n<br />\nYour Housing or Mine?<br />\nIt's that time of year again: time for freshmen to find the<br />\nplace that they will call \"home\" next year. It's also time for<br />\nupperclassmen who don't like their current residence to find<br />\na more suitable one. But is University housing the answer?<br />\nAs we are in the midst of the housing lottery, the push for<br />\nUniversity buildings is stronger than ever\u2014especially with the<br />\nnewly renovated Bradford Apartments and the yet-to-becompleted Wolman Hall. There are definite advantages to<br />\nUniversity housing, but there are also considerable drawbacks.<br />\nIt is these shortcomings that the University quite understandably<br />\nwishes to ignore, yet students must consider the \"big picture\"<br />\nbefore they possibly sign onto a sinking ship.<br />\nAfter a noisy round of renovations, Wolman Hall has suddenly become God's gift to housing: the University cannot spout<br />\nenough platitudes to applaud the \"new improved\" Wolman.<br />\nOf course this building will catch the average student's eye;<br />\nhowever, even a new building can have its share of problems.<br />\nCase in point\u2014the Bradford. Leaky pipes and malfunctioning<br />\nelevators are far from rare. Not even The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity can guarantee your apartment will be trouble-free.<br />\nA misconception provoked by the word new is that it means<br />\nbetter. The old Wolman featured very large rooms for the price.<br />\nThey may not have been the most attractive, but made up for<br />\nit in square footage. The new Wolman will no doubt be larger<br />\nand nicer\u2014but a great deal smaller as far as individual rooms<br />\ngo. While there is no furniture in Wolman as yet, one student<br />\nhas reported that some of the rooms in the Bradford are so tiny<br />\nthat a couch-bed cannot be opened all the way.<br />\nStudents should also think about the University's position in<br />\nthe Wolman affair. Mandatory sophomore housing begins with<br />\nnext year's freshman class. That means that the University has<br />\na vested interest in filling Wolman to the brim with any living,<br />\nbreathing, rent-paying individual next year because it needs to<br />\nbegin paying its ever-increasing construction costs. It's plain<br />\nand simple: the University is desperate.<br />\nThe issue here is that Hopkins is not necessarily interested<br />\n<br />\nin your needs. It has a goal that must be reached. Therefore,<br />\nstudents\u2014and especially current freshmen\u2014are being caught<br />\nin the numbers game. Unfortunately, those numbers are still<br />\nunavailable. Rates for Wolman rentals have not been posted<br />\nyet for a reason. The University doesn't want to scare off<br />\nstudents early in the game. Rowhouses are more reasonable<br />\nthan almost anything around, but they go fast, and students will<br />\nsoon be tight on time. The University is aware of this.<br />\nProximity to campus is another feature of University housing that is not unique. You do not have to live at the Carlyle<br />\nor far down on 29th Street if you don't opt for University housing. Your options are open: apartment, rowhouse, condominium. Yes, condominium. Some condo buildings are unofficially renting to students now. To take one example: three<br />\nHopkins students live just a few blocks away from campus in<br />\na very large two-bedroom condo and pay $300 plus utilities<br />\neach a month. That is cheaper than some apartment buildings,<br />\nand the security and privacy are better. If you don't have the<br />\nmoney to spend, three people can rent a three-bedroom<br />\nrowhouse apartment for $233 each plus utilities per month.<br />\nSo what are the right reasons for choosing University housing? One is that you want to\u2014not because the University strongly suggests that you do. Another is that you want to live in a<br />\ndorm-like atmosphere with your friends. Wolman would be<br />\nperfect for this, but the Bradford is an apartment building, and<br />\ntherefore might not suit your needs. One rule to live by:<br />\nwhenever possible, talk to other students who are living in the<br />\nbuilding that interests you. Find out the advantages and disadvantages. Ask them to be specific. \"It's nice\" doesn't tell you<br />\nmuch about the building.<br />\nDon't be misled into believing that you won't have any friends<br />\nif you don't live in University housing, either. Chances are that<br />\nyour friends will be living in the Charles Village area close<br />\nto campus. If it's worth the extra bucks every month to be able<br />\nto see and smell them, then you might want to live in University housing.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nParties and the 'Mandatory Donation'; Security Tips<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt is my understanding that it<br />\nagainst IFC rules for fraternities and<br />\nsororities to charge money upon entrance to their parties. Since this<br />\npractice is often flagrantly violated,<br />\nwhy are attempts not made to enforce it? This past Saturday night!<br />\nwent to both the TEP and the DU<br />\nparties and was required to pay $3<br />\nat the door. When I informed the<br />\nTEP brothers that charging admission was against IFC rules, they<br />\nreplied that they were not charging<br />\nfor admission; rather, they explained that the $3 was \"a mandatory<br />\ndonation to cover the costs of the<br />\nD.J. and the beer.\" I received a<br />\nsimilar explanation at DU.<br />\nCall it whatever you like\u2014a<br />\n\"mandatory donation\" or the price<br />\nof admission\u2014the name is irrelevant. The practice, however, is illegal. These guidelines were<br />\nestablished, in part, to prevent<br />\nfraternity parties from being moneymaking ventures. I figure that if 350<br />\npeople attend a fraternity party, then<br />\nthe fraternity grossed approximately $1000. Even after the costs of the<br />\nD.J. and the kegs of beer (for which<br />\nthey were responsible for paying),<br />\nthey still made a significant amount<br />\nof money. This is unjustly collected<br />\nmoney.<br />\nFraternities at Johns Hopkins enjoy various privileges that<br />\ndistinguish them from the rest of the<br />\nstudent population. As such, they<br />\nshould be required to abide by the<br />\nvery guidelines of conduct which<br />\nthey helped establish.<br />\nI do not mean TEP or DU. They<br />\nare not the only ones which charge<br />\nmoney at the door. Unfortunately,<br />\nmost fraternities require \"mandatory<br />\ndonations\"(with recent notable exceptions being Sig Ep, Kappa<br />\nSigma, Pi Lambda Phi, and Phi Si).<br />\n<br />\nPaying money to socialize at<br />\nHopkins, where there are so few<br />\norganized social events to begin<br />\nwith, is an exclusionary practice,<br />\nwhose prohibition ought to be enforced. When will this happen?<br />\nAnonymous<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn my four years at The Johns<br />\nHopkins University, I have nearly<br />\nalways found security officers, quad<br />\nmonitors, and student van drivers<br />\n(who deserve extra appreciation for<br />\nperforming a hectic and stressful job)<br />\nto be friendly and glad to help.<br />\nNevertheless, there is a strong impression, as expressed in recent<br />\neditorials and letters to the editor,<br />\nthat the Security Office is not concerned with the safety of the Johns<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\nThe escort vans are, as anyone<br />\nwho has ridden in them knows,<br />\nheavily overburdened. In general,<br />\n<br />\none has to wait a long time for the<br />\nvan to arrive, whether at MSE or<br />\nanother location, and once on the<br />\nvan, one may have to wait a long<br />\ntime to get dropped off.<br />\nI think that it would help if the<br />\nSecurity office would give an<br />\nestimated time of arrival. These<br />\nwere discontinued because the van<br />\ndrivers found it too stressful to conform to the ETA they gave. I suggest that they give a wider range,<br />\nsuch as 10-20 minutes, or 3-10<br />\nminutes. This information is very<br />\nhelpful to someone waiting where<br />\nthere is no safe place to watch for<br />\nthe van constantly, and be able to<br />\nmeet it as soon as it arrives, such as<br />\nthe Carnegie Institute, Giant,<br />\nrowhouse apartments, and most of<br />\nthe small shops in Charles Village,<br />\nRemmington, and Hampden.<br />\nIn addition, the front of MSE is a<br />\nterrible place to wait for the van after<br />\nthe library is closed. I know of a case<br />\n<br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

The average<br />\nAmerican throws away three and<br />\na half pounds of garbage every<br />\nweek, or half a ton per person per<br />\nyear. We throw out more than<br />\n160 million tons of garbage every<br />\nyear. Currently this garbage<br />\neither goes to a landfill, or to an<br />\nincinerator, or it gets recycled.<br />\nHalf of the landfills in the<br />\nUnited States will be full by next<br />\nyear. In New York City, four out<br />\nof six landfills are already closed. Garbage decays only very<br />\nslowly in landfills. Garbologists<br />\nhave found newspapers from the<br />\n(<br />\n1940s which are still readable and<br />\ngrass cuttings which ate still<br />\ngreen. Most landfills are not built<br />\nto contain toxic waste, and they<br />\ncontaminate the ground water<br />\nnearby. All four of the closed<br />\nlandfills in New York City are<br />\ncurrently listed by the state as<br />\nhazardous waste sites.<br />\nIncineration reduces the<br />\nvolume to 25 percent, but incinerators produce sulfur dioxide<br />\nand nitrogen dioxide, the two major components in acid rain, and<br />\nhydrogen chloride, a very<br />\npoisonous acid gas. A study by<br />\nthe Swedish government found<br />\nthat 55 percent of all mercury in<br />\nits environment comes from incinerators. Incinerators have problems in general with heavy<br />\nmetals, such as mercury. Since<br />\nthey don't burn, these heavy<br />\nmetals end up in the ash. Incinerator ash is very highly concentrated in toxins, and currently it goes straight to a landfill.<br />\nIncinerators are supposed to<br />\ncreate energy from the garbage,<br />\nbut most of the heat generated in<br />\nan incinerator is wasted melting<br />\nmetals in the garbage. Even the<br />\nbest incinerators have an efficiency of only 15 percent. Many incinerators are so inefficient, that<br />\nin order to burn the garbage, one<br />\nmust put in more energy than is<br />\nproduced.<br />\nBaltimore has two incinerators<br />\nand has made a commitment of<br />\none of the, RESCO,for 900 tons<br />\nof garbage every day. If the city<br />\ndoes not give RESCO this garbage, not only do we have to pay<br />\nfor 900 tons, but the incinerator is<br />\nallowed to find this garbage<br />\nelsewhere. Somehow, RESCO<br />\ngot a deal that if the pollution<br />\nstandards change, any pollution<br />\ncontrols added will be paid for by<br />\nthe city. How did we get trapped<br />\ninto this dead end deal?<br />\nThe economic potential of<br />\nrecycling has been well proven.<br />\nRecyclable goods are a commodity, a natural resource. If a person in Baltimore throws away an<br />\naluminum can, and it ends up in<br />\na landfill, then that aluminum is<br />\nout of circulation, 'and more<br />\naluminum will have to be mined<br />\nand smelted to be made into<br />\nanother can. If the can goes into<br />\nan incinerator, then not only is<br />\nthat aluminum out of circulation,<br />\nwe have wasted energy melting<br />\nit. If, on the other hand, the<br />\naluminum is kept within the<br />\nBaltimore economy, there are<br />\njobs created in Baltimore, jobs<br />\ncollecting the recyclables, jobs<br />\nworking them into a useable<br />\nform, and jobs making the new<br />\nproducts. Recycling one<br />\naluminum can saves the energy<br />\nequivalent to that can half full of<br />\ngasoline, or 95 percent of the<br />\nenergy used to make a new can<br />\nfrom raw materials. Every year,<br />\nmore than six tons of aluminum<br />\nis sold from Hopkins vending<br />\nmachines.<br />\nJohns Hopkins began recycling<br />\nlast year when the Students for<br />\nEnvironmental Action (SEA)<br />\nbegan an aluminum recyclying<br />\nprogram. The program was so.<br />\nsuccessful that the University<br />\ncreated JHU Recycles, run joinity<br />\nby the SEA and Custodial Services, which currently recycles<br />\n25 percent of the Hopkins waste<br />\nstream. In February, the SEA did<br />\na project in which student sorted<br />\nthrough all of the University's<br />\ntrash for one week and found that<br />\nat least 63 percent of the Hopkins<br />\nwaste stream could be recycled.<br />\nCurrently it costs Hopkins<br />\nmore than $85 per ton to send its<br />\n<br />\ngarbage to an incinerator or a<br />\nlandfill. Since the market pays for<br />\nwhite paper, aluminum, and<br />\nglass, and takes cardboard, tin<br />\nand low-grade paper for free, if<br />\nHopkins recycled this 63 percent<br />\nof its waste stream, it would save<br />\nover $40,000 each year.<br />\nNot only does recycling work<br />\non an institutional level, but some<br />\nstates and cities have found<br />\n<br />\nA pungent look at the<br />\nHopkins garbage situation<br />\n<br />\nrecycling to be an economic<br />\nboon. New York's bottle bill,<br />\nwhich puts a deposit on each bottle, saved New York $50 million<br />\nin clean-up costs, $19 million in<br />\nsolid waste costs, and bettween<br />\n$50 and $100 million in energy<br />\ncosts. Because of the bottle bill<br />\nin Iowa, 92 percent of bottles sold<br />\nin Iowa are reused or recycled.<br />\nMany places have curbside<br />\nrecycling, where one puts out<br />\nrecycleables in a special container<br />\nnext to one's garbage. In parts of<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\nNew Jersey, resident are only<br />\nallowed one can of garbage. Having an additional can picked up<br />\ncosts $3 per can per week. These<br />\nmeasures have helped New<br />\nJersey recycle 50 percent of its<br />\nwaste stream. Seattle has a<br />\nsimilar program and currently<br />\nrecycles 34 percent of its waste.<br />\nSeattle's goal is to recycle 60 percent of its waste by 1998.<br />\nWhy not in Baltimore? The<br />\nBaltimore recycling plan has<br />\nstarted curbside recycling in two<br />\nof twenty zones. A Baltimore<br />\ncommunity group sponsors rolloffs located around the city which<br />\ntake recycleables every Saturday.<br />\nBut Baltimore's goal is only 20<br />\npercent of the waste stream, and<br />\nincluded in that goal is energy<br />\ngenerated by the incinerator.<br />\nHopkins reached its first goal of<br />\n25 percent in six months. WE<br />\nnow know that we can reach a<br />\nmuch higher goal of 63 percent.<br />\nThere are plans currently being<br />\n<br />\ndiscussed between SEA and<br />\nCustodial Services which aim to<br />\nreach that goal. But Baltimore<br />\nwill be satisfied with 20 percent,<br />\ncounting incinerated garbage as<br />\nas part of that miniscule goal.<br />\nOf course, the real problem is<br />\nthat most of the garbage we<br />\ngenerate isn't necessary at all.<br />\nWhen SEA was doing its study,<br />\nstudents found pads of unused<br />\npaper and many other unused<br />\nitems. We need to stop throwing<br />\nthings out. If you are only buying one book at the bookstore, do<br />\nyou need a bag? At Levering<br />\nCafeteria, ask for a porcelain<br />\nplate.

Take the<br />\n<br />\nGRONews<br />\nTeaching Fellowships<br />\nDean Armstrong has created 20<br />\nnew Teaching Fellowships for<br />\n1991-92, designed to provide advanced graduate students with the<br />\nopportunity to create and teach a<br />\ncourse in their dissertation or<br />\nresearch areas. This program is<br />\nan ideal way to give undergrads<br />\naccess to the latest ideas and<br />\ndevelopments in an area by<br />\ncreating new higher-level<br />\ncourses. From the standpoint of<br />\ngraduate students, these<br />\nfellowships provide us financial<br />\nsupport while we finish our<br />\ndissertations, and give us recognition for outstanding teaching.<br />\nthese<br />\nfor<br />\nNominations<br />\nfellowships closed on March 6,<br />\nand announcements of awards<br />\nwill be made on Monday, March<br />\n11.<br />\nUndergraduates,<br />\nwhile<br />\nrecognizing that some graduate<br />\nstudents are among their best<br />\nteachers, have voiced understandable concerns lest the quality of<br />\nteaching at Hopkins be<br />\ndowngraded. Graduate students<br />\ntoo, while welcoming the<br />\nteaching fellowships, have also<br />\nvoiced concerns which were<br />\ndiscussed at the last GRO<br />\nmeeting. Our interests largely<br />\ncoincide with those of<br />\nundergraduates and, indeed, with<br />\n<br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\n<br />\nall those concerned with the<br />\nquality of education and student<br />\nlife. In summary:<br />\n1) The courses should be based on the specific areas of advanced graduate students' expertise. This will best meet the needs<br />\nboth of the graduate student<br />\nteacher, and of undergraduates<br />\nwho will benefit from the<br />\nteacher's strength in the subject<br />\ntaught, and from the widening of<br />\nthe curriculum. It would be a<br />\npoor use of the Teaching<br />\nFellowship to employ it, as one<br />\nchair has proposed (News-Letter,<br />\nFeb 22, 1991) to add extra sections to existing classes, or to<br />\nhave graduate students teach existing classes that would otherwise be taught by faculty. The<br />\nrisk is that what appears now as<br />\na good opportunity for graduate<br />\nstudents and an enrichment of the<br />\ncurriculum for undergraduates<br />\nmight, unless care is taken, be<br />\ntransformed into exploitation of<br />\ncheap labor (relative to faculty<br />\nsalaries) and the debasement of<br />\nthe level of undergraduate<br />\nteaching.<br />\n2)According to the university's<br />\nOffice of Student Financial Services, living expenses for 9<br />\nmonths in Baltimore come to<br />\n$10,050 for housing, food,<br />\n<br />\ngroups come and go with alarming speed (Remember the Beastie<br />\nBoys? Men at Work?). The New<br />\nMC Sting on the Block with En<br />\nVogue won't last forever, but<br />\nmaybe it will last long enough for<br />\na benefit concert to Clean Up the<br />\nGulf.<br />\nThe causes never go away<br />\ncompletely, but like a good toxic waste, they crop up periodically when the social climate is<br />\nright. There's a huge pile of<br />\ncauses somewhere, gradually<br />\ngrowing as ideals slip from the<br />\nAmerican mind. They look and<br />\nsmell like old fish, and they are,<br />\nof course, recyclable. Every so<br />\noften, an old one will be brought<br />\nback to life. It will wander back<br />\ninto the media, dumbly making<br />\nits way back into the public's consciousnesses and consciences.<br />\nEventually, the zombie cause will<br />\noutlive its uselessness and be<br />\nthrown back onto the pile. The<br />\nrecycling trend itself, ecologically<br />\nsound as it is, was recycled form<br />\nthe compost piles and eco-trends<br />\nof the seventies. All zombie fish,<br />\nstumbling, coming to get me\u2014<br />\n<br />\nhyped, their importance to the<br />\naverage viewer boosted by our<br />\nlittle advertising friends on<br />\nMadison Avenue. But each worthy and important cause can't remain worthy and important<br />\nforever. If that happened,<br />\nAmericans would stay concerned about a huge number of issues<br />\nfor years. It is important, then,<br />\nto carefully phase out causes once<br />\nthey have been sufficiently<br />\nhyped. One obvious kiss of death<br />\nis a song or concert dedicated to<br />\nthe cause in question. Popular<br />\n<br />\nI came around as my roommate<br />\nfinished dumping the bucket of<br />\nwater on me.<br />\n\"Wake up!\" he said. \"You're<br />\nhaving an allegory!\"<br />\nIt turned out that I had missed<br />\nthe best part of the Shuffleboard<br />\nTournament. The Bolivians had<br />\nalready had their argument with<br />\nthe French team over the ownership of a small cat named<br />\n\"Blisters.\" In the end, the Bolivians boycotted, I went to bed,<br />\nand somewhere, the market price<br />\nof alfalfa jumped a half-cent.<br />\n<br />\nbooks, and travel. This figure,<br />\nbased on Congressionally mandated Bureau of Labor Statistics<br />\nresearch, which accords with our<br />\ninformal survey of actual expenses of graduate students, is<br />\n.meet the reasonable<br />\ndesigned to<br />\nminimal needs of a single, independent student. This, amount<br />\nis roughly equivalent to two<br />\nsemesters' stipend for a recipient<br />\nof a Teaching Fellowship but is<br />\nabove the regular TA stipend in<br />\nmost departments. While we<br />\nshould applaud the fact that up to<br />\n20 students will be supported at<br />\nroughly the cost of living, this<br />\nshould not disguise the problem<br />\nthat most graduate students are<br />\nnot. This must be a concern to<br />\neveryone at Hopkins. Unless we<br />\nreceive realistic stipends, we wil<br />\nbe forced into taking additional<br />\noutside work, this delaying the<br />\nprogress and completion of our<br />\ndegrees. The best graduate<br />\nstudents may well go elsewhere.<br />\nAs one Hopkins faculty member,<br />\nbeing courted by an Ivy school,<br />\nrecently remarked, unless<br />\nHopkins is able to attract the best<br />\ngraduate students, it will be less<br />\nable to attract and retain the best<br />\nfaculty, who wish to work with<br />\ngraduate students of high quality.<br />\nWhether graduate students,<br />\nundergraduates, or faculty, we all<br />\nshare an interest in maintaining<br />\nthe quality of education and student life at Hopkins. Part of that<br />\ngoal involves providing opportunities and adequate support for<br />\ngraduate students. This meets not<br />\njust our needs, but the interests<br />\n<br />\nof the community as a whole.<br />\nWith that in mind, we welcome<br />\nthe new Teaching Fellowships as<br />\npotentially a step in the right<br />\ndirection.<br />\nUpcoming Events<br />\nPlease make note of the various<br />\ncampus events that GRO is supporting.

The Jays,<br />\n12-4-2 entering the game (but<br />\nundefeated since resuming play<br />\nafter winter break) and playing<br />\nfor the second consecutive night,<br />\nwere challenging the undefeated<br />\n(16-0-1) Tigers of Towson State<br />\nUniversity, who had not played<br />\nin four days. Towson had beaten<br />\nHopkins during both previous<br />\nmeetings in November but<br />\ntonight was a new game. The<br />\n\"visiting\" Jays, playing spirited<br />\nhockey sin,ce the break, defeated<br />\nTowson 5-4 to win their first<br />\nleague championship behind the<br />\nplay of game MVP Jason<br />\nSprague. While the area was filled to capacity with mostly Tiger<br />\nfans, the vocal Hopkins contingent remained until after the<br />\ntrophy presentation in a rousing<br />\ntribute<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nteam's<br />\naccomplishments.<br />\nIn only their fourth season,<br />\nHopkins returned to the championshp game for the second<br />\nstraight year. After losing to<br />\nGeorgetown last year, the Jays<br />\nwere determined to win the title<br />\nthis year. Although TSU grabbed the opening faceoff and popped three quick shots, team captain senior Dave Bowyer, playing his final game in goal for the<br />\nBlue Jays, established himself as<br />\na force in the net before Hopkins<br />\ncleared the puck and began to<br />\ntake the offensive. Just 1:20 into<br />\nthe game, Sprague blasted a shot<br />\nthat Tiger goalie John Poisal easily saved. However, the rebound<br />\npopped right back to Sprague<br />\nwho flipped it in for his first goal<br />\nof the game, giving the Jays an<br />\nearly 1-0 lead. The game continued at a furious pace for nearly ten minutes with each team<br />\n<br />\ngenerating break chances or<br />\nmismatches, but each time<br />\nBowyer and Poisal came up with<br />\nbig saves or the defenses<br />\nrecovered in time to poke the<br />\npuck away.<br />\nAt the 2:30 mark, Towson<br />\ndeveloped a one-on-none break at<br />\nthe red line. The Tiger skater carried the puck toward Bowyer in<br />\nwhat looked like a penalty shot attempt until Bowyer stopped the<br />\nshot and the Jays recovered to<br />\nclear. As Towson tried to<br />\npressure the goal, Sprague intercepted a Tiger pass at the blue<br />\nline and carried the puck in for<br />\na backhander that sprawled Poisal<br />\non the ice. The Jays picked up the<br />\nrebound and John Tymkewicz<br />\nregistered his second assist as he<br />\nslipped the puck back to Sprague<br />\nfor his second goal of the game<br />\nat 1:49 of the first period. By outshooting Towson 11-7 in the<br />\nperiod, Hopkins led 2-0 at the end<br />\nof one.<br />\nTowson got a quick three-ontwo advantage to start the second<br />\nperiod but the Tigers fell victim<br />\nto more of their poor passing and<br />\nblew the advantage without even<br />\ngetting a shot. After coincidental<br />\nminors were called for delay of<br />\ngame, both teams skated a foura-side and Hopkins seemed to<br />\ntake the advantage. Once again,<br />\nTymkewicz fed Sprague, who<br />\nthis time tipped the puck wide and<br />\nthe Towson squad finally connected on a long pass by springing a player for a good scoring<br />\nchance. With 0:41 still remaining<br />\nin the four-on-four time, Hopkins<br />\ndefenseman Phil Schied got back<br />\nand tripped up the Towson skater,<br />\nbreaking up the scoring chance<br />\nand earning two minutes in the<br />\npenalty box. While on the power<br />\nplay, TSU set up a great chance<br />\nby sending the puck to a player<br />\nin the slot who fanned. Towson<br />\nsent the puck back to the point<br />\nwhere they fired a shot that was<br />\n<br />\ndeflected in front of the goal.<br />\nWith Bowyer down and a mass<br />\nof bodies falling around the goal,<br />\nthe Towson fans cheered, one of<br />\ntheir forwards raised his stick and<br />\nthe referee even raised one arm to<br />\nsignal a goal until he realized that<br />\nBowyer had just made a<br />\nremarkable save. The Jays killed the rest of the penalty in the<br />\nTowson end to preserve the 2-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nTowson went on trying<br />\nnumerous shots from the blue line<br />\nbut were usually way off the<br />\nmark. Even when their shots<br />\nwere in the general direction of<br />\nthe goal, they seemed to have so<br />\nmany skaters in front of the net<br />\nthat the puck would be knocked<br />\ndown, deflected away, or intercepted before it ever got to the<br />\ngoal. Towson finally scored on<br />\none of these screens as Carey<br />\nMorrison tipped in a shot from<br />\nthe point at 8:38 of the second<br />\nperiod. Hopkins came back 90<br />\nseconds later as Sprague initiated<br />\na two-on-one that developed into a one-on-none after his shot<br />\nwas saved. Sophomore Wells<br />\nDixon, streaking in unguarded,<br />\ngrabbed the rebound and flipped<br />\nit in to regain a two-goal advantage for the Jays. Shortly after the<br />\nteam's third goal, Patrick<br />\nChiasson, using his incredible<br />\nskating ability, grabbed a loose<br />\npuck, came in, and drilled a slap<br />\nshot from forty feet out. Poisal<br />\nsaved the blast with his face and<br />\nthen fell back into the net like a<br />\ndomino.<br />\nHopkins' size advantage started<br />\nto become apparent as many of<br />\nthe Blue Jay skaters used the body<br />\nto take Towson players off the<br />\npuck. When Towson did gain an<br />\nadvantage, they usually failed to<br />\nmake the extra pass to set up an<br />\nopen shot and ended up flying into the boards or dropping to the<br />\nice under crunching checks by<br />\nCraig Hampton, Dave Boxen-<br />\n<br />\nbaum, Chad Holien, Malcolm<br />\nLloyd, Hooper Conrad, Schied,<br />\nTymkewicz and Sprague.<br />\nAttempting to avoid the<br />\nthunderous checks, the Tigers<br />\ncontinued to shoot wide and failed to put the puck on goal. With<br />\nnine seconds remaining in the<br />\nperiod, Hopkins then got what<br />\nappeared to be the back-breaker<br />\nas Sprague got out on a breakaway and converted the chance<br />\nfor a hat-trick. His third goal of<br />\nthe game came as Towson tried<br />\nto pressure the Jays' net and he<br />\nblocked a shot, went streaking out<br />\nover the blue line, held off a<br />\nhooking defender, faked Poisal<br />\nand scored a short-side<br />\nbackhander for a 4-1 lead at the<br />\nend of two.<br />\nWith a record of 23-5-1 at Mt.<br />\nPleasant Arena, undefeated this<br />\nyear, and a skating Tiger mascot<br />\nto excite them, Towson fans were<br />\ncertain their Tigers were not out<br />\nof the game yet. Not disappointing them, Towson came out and<br />\nscored thirteen seconds into the<br />\nthird period on a scramble in<br />\nfront. Two minutes later Towson<br />\nscored again and suddenly the<br />\nJays' three-goal lead was cut to<br />\none. Just fourteen seconds later,<br />\nHooper Conrad blasted a shot<br />\nfrom the point and the Jays' lead<br />\nwas back to two at 5-3.<br />\nThe goal that proved to be the<br />\ngame winner slowed the Tigers'<br />\nmomentum until they got a great<br />\nchance while shorthanded. Blocking a Blue Jay shot at the blue<br />\nline, Towson came in on a break,<br />\nbut Bowyer sprawled low on the<br />\nice and came up with a big save<br />\nto keep the Jays emotionally<br />\ncharged. After recovering from<br />\nthe miscuse, Hopkins forced the<br />\nplay and maintained solid<br />\npressure throughout the balance<br />\nof the power play. As the penalized player came back for the<br />\nTigers, he received a pass wide<br />\nContinued on page 15<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n4,...<br />\n,ois.11<br />\ne ' 1st\u2014<br />\n1<br />\n\u201e,;; 14\u2022<br />\n..;;;;::::<br />\n- ,.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 :::\u2022<br />\nle\u201e,.0<br />\ns,o.ov,.\".1<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nor<br />\n<br />\n:.!!!4:.<br />\n, ..;tir tom ee,:s<br />\n. 1 1::::!.4<br />\n.... \u2022 11.00<br />\nassom-.1.<br />\n,<br />\n....<br />\n_die<br />\nloss.'14111<br />\nvigi,<br />\n,,,*<br />\n:: ..k.<br />\n<br />\norWOWO*1*.,<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nOti.14<br />\n*a 0.<br />\n<br />\n,40<br />\nMidfielder Keith Gertsen protects goalie Ian Hobbs in home opener.<br />\n<br />\nMen's Lacrosse Loses<br />\nTough Home Opener<br />\nby Jay Friedman<br />\nHomewood,Saturday, March 2<br />\nThe Seaman Era of Hopkins<br />\nLacrosse suffered a setback today<br />\nas the Blue Jays opened the 1991<br />\nseason the same way they ended<br />\nthe 1990 campaign, losing to<br />\nPrinceton before a disappointed<br />\ncrowd of 5000. The Princeton<br />\nTigers held the Jays scoreless<br />\nwhile amassing seven goals during a twenty-six minute stretch<br />\nover the second and third quarters<br />\nthat blew the game open. After<br />\nsuffering a 15-10 defeat in his<br />\nfirst game as Hopkins' Head<br />\nCoach, Tony Seaman recognized that the Jays still have some<br />\nshortcomings but fortunately,<br />\nthey can be overcome in time.<br />\n\"They were better than us today.<br />\nThey did things right, got the key<br />\nground balls, better shots and the<br />\nbounces went their way.

He had been held to<br />\nseven points in the MAC game,<br />\nas Blue Jay guards Dave<br />\nEikenberg and Michael Rotay<br />\nforced him into a 2-15 shooting<br />\nnightmare.

The<br />\n1991 Jays, who trounced Coppin<br />\nState 19-5 and whipped<br />\nDivision I UMBC 13-8, may actually be improved over the 1990<br />\nedition, which won twenty-eight<br />\nof its thirty-nine contests.<br />\nJeff Fang (5-2 last year)<br />\nrecorded the victory against Coppin State, pitching five innings<br />\nand allowing four runs. Fang's<br />\ncause was greatly aided by the<br />\nJays' offensive attack, which exploded for seven runs in the bottom of the fifth inning. A pair of<br />\nsenior outfielders, Ken Kroczenski (.276 last season) and Ken<br />\nBrodkowitz(.303)combined for<br />\nsix hits and three RBI's.<br />\nSophomore Matt Menz (.474 in<br />\nonly 19 AB's) provided the<br />\npower, stroking a long home run.<br />\nAlthough the fourteen-run<br />\ntriumph was certainly impressive,<br />\nit gave little insight as to the<br />\nquality of the JHU squad.<br />\nJunior Bill Paukovits, who pitched in relief in the Coppin State<br />\ngame, was surprised that Coppin<br />\nState did not provide more of a<br />\nchallenge. \"Talentwise, they're<br />\na good team, but they seemed undisciplined.\"<br />\nThough the Jays remember losing to the Division I Retrievers<br />\nlast year, they put that behind<br />\n<br />\nthem and came up with a solid<br />\nvictory. Behind two more circuitclouts from Menz, and a grand<br />\nslam from Brodkowitz, the Jays'<br />\noffense never let up. The multiple home runs, however, might<br />\nbe attributed to the fence being<br />\nmoved in closer. Brodkowitz, as<br />\na pitcher and rightfielder, had<br />\nmixed feelings about this change,<br />\nbut he admitted that \"since we<br />\nhave a lot of power, but lack<br />\nspeed, this could help us win<br />\nclose games.\"<br />\nJoe Tortorello, a sophomore,<br />\nwas the starter and winner for<br />\nHopkins. He, like Fang, pitched<br />\njust well enough to win, working<br />\nhis way out of several dangerous<br />\njams, with support from a reliable<br />\ndefense. Whenever UMBC was<br />\nable to scratch out a few runs, the<br />\nHopkins line-up responded by<br />\nwidening its lead.<br />\nMenz, who pitches and plays<br />\nfirst base, commented on the importance of the win against a<br />\nDivision I team. \"This was a<br />\nreally big win for us, since we're<br />\na really young team. It gives us<br />\nsomething to build upon to have<br />\na good season.\"<br />\nJunior Mike Fraser, starting second baseman, was quick to<br />\nagree. \"We were confident going into the UMBC game after we<br />\nplayed well against Coppin State.<br />\nWe expected good pitching from<br />\nUMBC, but the first pitcher was<br />\na little bit wild. and we took advantage of that.\"<br />\n<br />\nas seniors Matt Panetta and Mike<br />\nMorrissey hooked up for a goal<br />\njust two minutes into the game.<br />\nMorrissey added his second only twenty-eight seconds later,<br />\nprompting Princeton coach and<br />\nSeaman's close friend Bill<br />\nTierney to take a time-out(much<br />\nlike last year's playoffs). Tierney<br />\nlooked for a moment as though<br />\nhe had made the wrong decision<br />\nby starting freshman Scott<br />\nBacigalupo in goal. But then it<br />\nwas the Blue Jays' goalie Scott<br />\nGiardina who disappointed<br />\neveryone by missing the first shot<br />\nat him, a fifteen-yarder from<br />\nHighley Thompson. The Hopkins<br />\nattack came back for a goal by<br />\nPanetta, restoring the two-goal<br />\nlead and prompting chants of<br />\n\"the goalie's a sieve\" toward<br />\nBacigalupo. Giardina came up<br />\nwith a big save on a point-blank<br />\nshot and appeared ready to step<br />\nforward as the 'Jays' post-Quint<br />\ngoalie until the teams traded<br />\ngoals. With 35 seconds left in the<br />\nfirst quarter, Hopkins had a solid<br />\n4-2 lead but back-to-back goals at<br />\n14:26 and seven seconds later, off<br />\nthe ensuing faceoff, tied it up for<br />\nthe Tigers and gave them an emotional lift heading into the start of<br />\nthe second period.<br />\nAfter three minutes of play,<br />\nHopkins tri-captain Seth Tierney<br />\nset up a goal with a great pass to<br />\nDrew Burns who received the<br />\nball on the _crease, faked and<br />\nscored. That was the last time<br />\n\"we wanted more\" for twentysix minutes as the Tigers went on<br />\na seven-goal spurt. After three<br />\nstraight goals and back-to-back<br />\nscores by Hopkins-killer Justin<br />\nTortolani eleven seconds apart,<br />\nSeaman made a tough decision.<br />\nThe Hopkins coach pulled Giardina, who likened his own performance to swiss cheese, in<br />\nfavor of Ian Hobbs.

However, the one-onone play of several Blue Jays<br />\nresulted in poor shot selection and<br />\neasy saves for Bacigalupo. Indeed, after the game many people were talking as though<br />\nBacigalupo was the only reason<br />\nPrinceton ever had a chance. To<br />\nthe coiatary, the Princeton offense controlled the ball for so<br />\nlong that when the Jays had the<br />\nball, they did not seem<br />\nto know what to do. Shots from<br />\nlong range or sharp angles meant<br />\nthat Bacigalupo hardly had to<br />\nmove to pick the balls out of the<br />\nair. When Bacigalupo got away<br />\na breakout pass, Princeton scored<br />\non fast break advantages.<br />\nHowever, more often Bacigalupo<br />\nset up a clear and the Hopkins<br />\nride was successful in defending<br />\nContinued on page 14<br />\n<br />\n\f14/MARCH 8, 1991<br />\n<br />\nFencing Dominates UAA<br />\nby Ethan Skolnick<br />\nAfter his 17-3 fencing squad's<br />\nsolid performance in the February<br />\n23rd UAA Championships,<br />\nCoach Richard Oles decided to<br />\ntry his luck at prognosticating.<br />\n\"I don't know how well the<br />\nsabre and foil teams will do next<br />\nweekend fat the March 2nd.<br />\nNCAA Regionals] because we're<br />\nreally not that familiar with the<br />\nRegional format or competition,\"<br />\nOles said. \"But, I think the epee<br />\nteam has a chance to finish in the<br />\ntop two.\"<br />\nIf his run with Blue Jay fencing ever ends, Oles could always<br />\nfind work as a fortune-teller.<br />\nWhile the foil and sabre teams did<br />\nindeed struggle at the eight-team<br />\nRegional tournament (finishing<br />\neight and seventh, respectively),<br />\nthe epee squad turned in a dazzling second-place effort.<br />\nFeaturing Jorge Gana, Jason<br />\nColeman, and Timothy Train, the<br />\nepee squad made a major state-<br />\n<br />\nment about the quality of Johns<br />\nHopkins fencing. The Jays were<br />\nthe only non-Division I school in<br />\nthe tourney, and still managed to<br />\ndominate many bouts. Gana, the<br />\njunior captain, followed last<br />\nweek's 1st-place UAA finish with<br />\nanother strong performance.<br />\nColeman, also a junior, had been<br />\n3rd at the UAA's, and fenced<br />\nwell once again. Perhaps the key<br />\ncontributor, however, was Train,<br />\na senior. Last year, Train was the<br />\nDivision III epee champion, but<br />\nhe had previously participated in<br />\nonly foil competition during the<br />\n1991 campaign. At next<br />\nweekend's MAC home tournament, Ronnie Spring (recovering<br />\nfrom a knee injury) will retake his<br />\nplace on the epee team, allowing<br />\nTrain to go back to foil.<br />\nAfter the MAC Tournament,<br />\nthe Jays will wait and hope that<br />\nthe NCAA extends them a bid to<br />\nthe next round of the national<br />\ntournament.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins Rugby Club lost<br />\nits second game of the season to<br />\nvisiting St. Mary's College. Once<br />\nagain, Hopkins was unable to put<br />\nthe ball into the try zone. Their<br />\ndefense, however, kept the potent<br />\nSt. Mary's club out of the try<br />\nzone for much of the game. The<br />\nfinal score stood at 4-0, St.<br />\nMary's. In the first half, both ball<br />\nclubs were able to drive deep into their opponent's territory<br />\nseveral times, but neither club<br />\nwas able to score. Much of the<br />\nsecond half proceeded the same<br />\nway until 25 minutes into the<br />\ngame. St. Mary's was close to<br />\nHopkins' try zone, but was<br />\nunable to score in three sustained drives. On their next drive,<br />\nhowever, their inside center<br />\nweaved through the Hopkins line<br />\nand plunged into the try zone for<br />\nthe only score of the game.<br />\nOnce again, Hopkins' B-side<br />\nsalvaged the day forAhe rugby<br />\nteam.

He registered a goal<br />\nand an assist and, equally as important, occupied Princeton's top<br />\ndefender, leaving Jeff Wills,<br />\nMorrissey or Burns in a potential<br />\nmismatch situation.

Unfortunately, any emotion<br />\nthe Jays could have generated<br />\nquickly evaporated as the Tigers<br />\nscored seventeen seconds into the<br />\nfourth quarter. Wills came back<br />\nto score for the Jays before<br />\nTierney added his second and<br />\nAdam Wright scored two.<br />\nHowever, it was a case of too little, too late.<br />\nFor the Jays to be successful,<br />\nthe middies will have to wctrk on<br />\nmoving without the ball and getting it to players behind the cage<br />\nto set up the offense. Seaman<br />\nobserved that classifying a game<br />\nas upbeat might not best suit the<br />\ncurrent Hopkins squad. Ball control at certain times, such as<br />\nPrinceton's run, might better help<br />\nsettle a frustrated offensive team.<br />\nAlthough Princeton was a<br />\nphysically faster team, Dwan<br />\nnoted that it's not the speed that<br />\nmakes the difference but the<br />\nheart. \"We have to hustle, get the<br />\nground balls, prevent turnovers<br />\nand use some ball control. We<br />\njust played defense for too long,\"<br />\ncommented Dwan. It sounds like<br />\nHopkins can take a page out of<br />\nthe New York Giants playbook.<br />\nEstablish an early lead, play<br />\ntough defense, especially in goal,<br />\ncontrol the ball and capitalize on<br />\n<br />\ntheir opponents' failures when<br />\npressing to catch up. \u2014 We have<br />\nto rebound and move on and not<br />\ndwell on this game. We're still<br />\nadjusting to a new system and<br />\nthere are ten games left,\" Dwan<br />\nconcluded.<br />\nAfter Giardina and Hobbs were<br />\nscorched for fifteen goals, the<br />\nstarting job will be decided in<br />\npractice. Expect Giardina to have<br />\na slight edge since it is tough to<br />\nreplace a starter after one game<br />\nunless the backup performs<br />\noutstandingly. Additionally, the<br />\nmidfield will have to make better decisions with and without the<br />\nball. One area in which the midfield suffered terribly was getting<br />\nout of position and being beaten<br />\non fast break clears or unsettled<br />\nsituations. Seaman will work with<br />\nthe midfielders trying to teach<br />\nthem to recognize certain situations and the appropriate<br />\nresponse. \"We definitely learned some things about ourselves<br />\nand what we can do,\" concluded Seaman. Finally, one area<br />\nover which the team has little<br />\ncontrol and much to be concerned about is officiating. Hopkins<br />\nusually has the same incompetent<br />\ncrew for most of their home<br />\ngames. The only consolation<br />\nmight be that they missed calls<br />\nboth ways, although the bad calls<br />\n(or no-calls) hurt the Jays far<br />\nmore than the Tigers.<br />\n<br />\n13IA NOTES<br />\nminton tournament: Vincent/Willard topped Hollander<br />\nto win the dormitories:<br />\nSylvester came in third.

He<br />\nnoted a clear health risk to the<br />\npublic who consumes grapes.<br />\nChavez is turning to the public<br />\nfor boycotting as a last resort after<br />\nmany failed, attempts to have<br />\ngovernment authorities in<br />\nCalifornia pass legislation that<br />\nwould ban the use of pesticides<br />\non the fields.

In the past, Chavez's<br />\nboycott rallies have been successful in having legislation<br /><br />\npassed that inhibited the use of<br />\ncertain pesticides, such as DDT,<br />\non grape fields and workers.<br />\nHowever, that was a shortlived success. After Governor<br />\nGeorge Dukemajen became<br />\ngovernor of California, he<br />\nrestrained the enforcement of<br />\nlegislation preventing the use of<br />\npesticides on California fields.<br />\nChavez attributed this in part to<br />\nthe fact that Governor Deukmajen's election campaign was<br />\nlargely paid for by the grape<br />\nowners of California and their<br />\nsupportive groups.<br />\nDespite such powerful political<br />\nopposition, Chavez said that the<br />\ngrape boycott would only have to<br />\ninfluence nine percent of the consumers in order to have the grape<br />\nowners turn an open ear to the<br />\npeople and reconsider their use of<br />\npesticides on California fields, as<br />\nopposed to an unattainable fiftyone percent majority vote in the<br />\nCalifornia houses of legislature.<br />\n\"The solution is simple,\" said<br />\nChavez, \"every time you go to<br />\nthe market don't buy any<br />\ngrapes\u2014you're voting.

Early last year, when<br />\nthe recycling project took off,<br />\nnewspaper was a big hit, Guiles<br />\nsaid.

But<br />\nthen, Miranda had been unhappy<br />\nfor the last few weeks, and it was<br />\nnothing new to her. She hadn't<br />\nheard from David in weeks, Zack<br />\nseemed to be avoiding her, and<br />\nDoris didn't seem to be avoiding<br />\nher. What else, she thotight,<br />\ncould go wrong?<br />\nAs soon as she thought it,<br />\nthough, she realized what a karmically stupid thing that was to<br />\nthink. The easiest way to have<br />\nthings go wrong is to think that<br />\nthere's no way they can.<br />\nSo Miranda wasn't that surprised when Doris pushed aside<br />\nthe curtain and walked into her<br />\nroom.<br />\n\"Time to talk, Miranda,\"<br />\nDoris said, with an odd note of<br />\nseriousness in her voice.<br />\n\"Yes?\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"I'm sick and tired of you sitting around here moping all day.<br />\nYou need to get out more.\"<br />\nMiranda realized with horror<br />\nthat Doris was telling her to get<br />\nout more. Something must be<br />\nwrong.<br />\n\"You know you upset Zack by<br />\nkicking him out?\"<br />\n\"He doesn't live here, Doris.\"<br />\n\"And you never even asked me<br />\nabout Chris?\"<br />\nMiranda bit. \"What about<br />\nChris?\" she said.<br />\nDoris' whole demeanor changed. Gone was the serious, stern<br />\nlook of a normal human being; it<br />\nwas replaced by the look of a person who wants to talk about sex.<br />\nMiranda knew the look from<br />\nthe long nights she, Doris, and<br />\nCarol had spent back in the<br />\ndorms, reliving the slumber parties that cast their shadow over in<br />\njunior high school and dormitories. Carol would talk for<br />\nhours about her past sexual experiences(including the ones that<br />\nshe never really had but fit into<br />\nthe discussion well enough),<br />\nDoris would talk about<br />\nnewscasters that she lusted after,<br />\nand Miranda would talk only<br />\nwhen spoken to.<br /><br />\nIt was a wonderful time, and<br />\nMiranda might have looked too<br />\nfondly upon it when choosing<br />\nwho she wanted to have leaving<br />\ndishes in her sink.<br />\nHowever, while Miranda's<br />\nbrain sat in the cheese casserole<br />\npan in the sink, Doris' was running overtime telling Miranda all<br /><br />\nIn which Zack goes<br />\nhouse hunting, Miranda<br />\ngoes along, and Doris<br />\nrecalls her sexual tryst<br /><br />\nabout her new relationship, emphasizing the aspects that occurred without underwear.<br />\nJust as Doris had begun to tell<br />\nher about how Chris wore his red<br />\nargyles throughout the whole experience, Miranda was saved by<br />\nthe bell.<br />\nDoris answered it. It was Zack.<br />\nPerhaps saved wasn't the right<br />\ncliche.<br />\n\"Hey, Doris,\" Zack muttered.<br />\n\"You ready?\"<br />\n\"Ready?\"<br />\n\"To look for my apartment?\"<br />\n\"Oh. Right.\" Doris looked<br />\nback at Miranda with a look that<br />\nsaid 'if you don't come with us<br />\nto do this, that cheese casserole<br />\ndish will be growing more things<br />\nin it than the meat loaf dish<br />\nit.' Miranda<br />\nunderneath<br />\nunderstood the sentiment enough<br />\nto ask if she could come along.<br />\n\"Sure, why not,\" Zack<br />\nmuttered.<br />\nThe first place Zack stopped<br />\nwas a rowhouse about two blocks<br />\naway from where Miranda lived.<br />\nThe front door(or rather, the second half of the front door\u2014the<br />\nfirst half was conspicuously absent) sat half on its hinges, and<br />\nthere was a strange man sitting in<br />\nfront of it muttering something<br />\nabout pod people.<br />\nZack was beaming at it.<br />\n\"You Zack?\" a burly old man<br />\nContinued on page 15<br /><br />\nYour Housing or Mine?<br />\nIt's that time of year again: time for freshmen to find the<br />\nplace that they will call \"home\" next year. It's also time for<br />\nupperclassmen who don't like their current residence to find<br />\na more suitable one. But is University housing the answer?<br />\nAs we are in the midst of the housing lottery, the push for<br />\nUniversity buildings is stronger than ever\u2014especially with the<br />\nnewly renovated Bradford Apartments and the yet-to-becompleted Wolman Hall. There are definite advantages to<br />\nUniversity housing, but there are also considerable drawbacks.<br />\nIt is these shortcomings that the University quite understandably<br />\nwishes to ignore, yet students must consider the \"big picture\"<br />\nbefore they possibly sign onto a sinking ship.<br />\nAfter a noisy round of renovations, Wolman Hall has suddenly become God's gift to housing: the University cannot spout<br />\nenough platitudes to applaud the \"new improved\" Wolman.<br />\nOf course this building will catch the average student's eye;<br />\nhowever, even a new building can have its share of problems.<br />\nCase in point\u2014the Bradford. Leaky pipes and malfunctioning<br />\nelevators are far from rare. Not even The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity can guarantee your apartment will be trouble-free.<br />\nA misconception provoked by the word new is that it means<br />\nbetter. The old Wolman featured very large rooms for the price.<br />\nThey may not have been the most attractive, but made up for<br />\nit in square footage. The new Wolman will no doubt be larger<br />\nand nicer\u2014but a great deal smaller as far as individual rooms<br />\ngo. While there is no furniture in Wolman as yet, one student<br />\nhas reported that some of the rooms in the Bradford are so tiny<br />\nthat a couch-bed cannot be opened all the way.<br />\nStudents should also think about the University's position in<br />\nthe Wolman affair. Mandatory sophomore housing begins with<br />\nnext year's freshman class. That means that the University has<br />\na vested interest in filling Wolman to the brim with any living,<br />\nbreathing, rent-paying individual next year because it needs to<br />\nbegin paying its ever-increasing construction costs. It's plain<br />\nand simple: the University is desperate.<br />\nThe issue here is that Hopkins is not necessarily interested<br /><br />\nin your needs. It has a goal that must be reached. Therefore,<br />\nstudents\u2014and especially current freshmen\u2014are being caught<br />\nin the numbers game. Unfortunately, those numbers are still<br />\nunavailable. Rates for Wolman rentals have not been posted<br />\nyet for a reason. The University doesn't want to scare off<br />\nstudents early in the game. Rowhouses are more reasonable<br />\nthan almost anything around, but they go fast, and students will<br />\nsoon be tight on time. The University is aware of this.<br />\nProximity to campus is another feature of University housing that is not unique. You do not have to live at the Carlyle<br />\nor far down on 29th Street if you don't opt for University housing. Your options are open: apartment, rowhouse, condominium. Yes, condominium. Some condo buildings are unofficially renting to students now. To take one example: three<br />\nHopkins students live just a few blocks away from campus in<br />\na very large two-bedroom condo and pay $300 plus utilities<br />\neach a month. That is cheaper than some apartment buildings,<br />\nand the security and privacy are better. If you don't have the<br />\nmoney to spend, three people can rent a three-bedroom<br />\nrowhouse apartment for $233 each plus utilities per month.<br />\nSo what are the right reasons for choosing University housing? One is that you want to\u2014not because the University strongly suggests that you do. Another is that you want to live in a<br />\ndorm-like atmosphere with your friends. Wolman would be<br />\nperfect for this, but the Bradford is an apartment building, and<br />\ntherefore might not suit your needs. One rule to live by:<br />\nwhenever possible, talk to other students who are living in the<br />\nbuilding that interests you. Find out the advantages and disadvantages. Ask them to be specific. \"It's nice\" doesn't tell you<br />\nmuch about the building.<br />\nDon't be misled into believing that you won't have any friends<br />\nif you don't live in University housing, either. Chances are that<br />\nyour friends will be living in the Charles Village area close<br />\nto campus.

This past Saturday night!<br />\nwent to both the TEP and the DU<br />\nparties and was required to pay $3<br />\nat the door. When I informed the<br />\nTEP brothers that charging admission was against IFC rules, they<br />\nreplied that they were not charging<br />\nfor admission; rather, they explained that the $3 was \"a mandatory<br />\ndonation to cover the costs of the<br />\nD.J. and the beer.\" I received a<br />\nsimilar explanation at DU.<br />\nCall it whatever you like\u2014a<br />\n\"mandatory donation\" or the price<br />\nof admission\u2014the name is irrelevant. The practice, however, is illegal. These guidelines were<br />\nestablished, in part, to prevent<br />\nfraternity parties from being moneymaking ventures. I figure that if 350<br />\npeople attend a fraternity party, then<br />\nthe fraternity grossed approximately $1000. Even after the costs of the<br />\nD.J. and the kegs of beer (for which<br />\nthey were responsible for paying),<br />\nthey still made a significant amount<br />\nof money. This is unjustly collected<br />\nmoney.<br />\nFraternities at Johns Hopkins enjoy various privileges that<br />\ndistinguish them from the rest of the<br />\nstudent population. As such, they<br />\nshould be required to abide by the<br />\nvery guidelines of conduct which<br />\nthey helped establish.<br />\nI do not mean TEP or DU. They<br />\nare not the only ones which charge<br />\nmoney at the door. Unfortunately,<br />\nmost fraternities require \"mandatory<br />\ndonations\"(with recent notable exceptions being Sig Ep, Kappa<br />\nSigma, Pi Lambda Phi, and Phi Si).<br /><br />\nPaying money to socialize at<br />\nHopkins, where there are so few<br />\norganized social events to begin<br />\nwith, is an exclusionary practice,<br />\nwhose prohibition ought to be enforced.

These<br />\nwere discontinued because the van<br />\ndrivers found it too stressful to conform to the ETA they gave. I suggest that they give a wider range,<br />\nsuch as 10-20 minutes, or 3-10<br />\nminutes. This information is very<br />\nhelpful to someone waiting where<br />\nthere is no safe place to watch for<br />\nthe van constantly, and be able to<br />\nmeet it as soon as it arrives, such as<br />\nthe Carnegie Institute, Giant,<br />\nrowhouse apartments, and most of<br />\nthe small shops in Charles Village,<br />\nRemmington, and Hampden.<br />\nIn addition, the front of MSE is a<br />\nterrible place to wait for the van after<br />\nthe library is closed.

The average<br />\nAmerican throws away three and<br />\na half pounds of garbage every<br />\nweek, or half a ton per person per<br />\nyear. We throw out more than<br />\n160 million tons of garbage every<br />\nyear. Currently this garbage<br />\neither goes to a landfill, or to an<br />\nincinerator, or it gets recycled.<br />\nHalf of the landfills in the<br />\nUnited States will be full by next<br />\nyear. In New York City, four out<br />\nof six landfills are already closed. Garbage decays only very<br />\nslowly in landfills. Garbologists<br />\nhave found newspapers from the<br />\n(<br />\n1940s which are still readable and<br />\ngrass cuttings which ate still<br />\ngreen. Most landfills are not built<br />\nto contain toxic waste, and they<br />\ncontaminate the ground water<br />\nnearby. All four of the closed<br />\nlandfills in New York City are<br />\ncurrently listed by the state as<br />\nhazardous waste sites.<br />\nIncineration reduces the<br />\nvolume to 25 percent, but incinerators produce sulfur dioxide<br />\nand nitrogen dioxide, the two major components in acid rain, and<br />\nhydrogen chloride, a very<br />\npoisonous acid gas. A study by<br />\nthe Swedish government found<br />\nthat 55 percent of all mercury in<br />\nits environment comes from incinerators. Incinerators have problems in general with heavy<br />\nmetals, such as mercury. Since<br />\nthey don't burn, these heavy<br />\nmetals end up in the ash. Incinerator ash is very highly concentrated in toxins, and currently it goes straight to a landfill.<br />\nIncinerators are supposed to<br />\ncreate energy from the garbage,<br />\nbut most of the heat generated in<br />\nan incinerator is wasted melting<br />\nmetals in the garbage. Even the<br />\nbest incinerators have an efficiency of only 15 percent. Many incinerators are so inefficient, that<br />\nin order to burn the garbage, one<br />\nmust put in more energy than is<br />\nproduced.<br />\nBaltimore has two incinerators<br />\nand has made a commitment of<br />\none of the, RESCO,for 900 tons<br />\nof garbage every day. If the city<br />\ndoes not give RESCO this garbage, not only do we have to pay<br />\nfor 900 tons, but the incinerator is<br />\nallowed to find this garbage<br />\nelsewhere. Somehow, RESCO<br />\ngot a deal that if the pollution<br />\nstandards change, any pollution<br />\ncontrols added will be paid for by<br />\nthe city. How did we get trapped<br />\ninto this dead end deal?<br />\nThe economic potential of<br />\nrecycling has been well proven.<br />\nRecyclable goods are a commodity, a natural resource. If a person in Baltimore throws away an<br />\naluminum can, and it ends up in<br />\na landfill, then that aluminum is<br />\nout of circulation, 'and more<br />\naluminum will have to be mined<br />\nand smelted to be made into<br />\nanother can. If the can goes into<br />\nan incinerator, then not only is<br />\nthat aluminum out of circulation,<br />\nwe have wasted energy melting<br />\nit. If, on the other hand, the<br />\naluminum is kept within the<br />\nBaltimore economy, there are<br />\njobs created in Baltimore, jobs<br />\ncollecting the recyclables, jobs<br />\nworking them into a useable<br />\nform, and jobs making the new<br />\nproducts. Recycling one<br />\naluminum can saves the energy<br />\nequivalent to that can half full of<br />\ngasoline, or 95 percent of the<br />\nenergy used to make a new can<br />\nfrom raw materials. Every year,<br />\nmore than six tons of aluminum<br />\nis sold from Hopkins vending<br />\nmachines.<br />\nJohns Hopkins began recycling<br />\nlast year when the Students for<br />\nEnvironmental Action (SEA)<br />\nbegan an aluminum recyclying<br />\nprogram. The program was so.<br />\nsuccessful that the University<br />\ncreated JHU Recycles, run joinity<br />\nby the SEA and Custodial Services, which currently recycles<br />\n25 percent of the Hopkins waste<br />\nstream. In February, the SEA did<br />\na project in which student sorted<br />\nthrough all of the University's<br />\ntrash for one week and found that<br />\nat least 63 percent of the Hopkins<br />\nwaste stream could be recycled.<br />\nCurrently it costs Hopkins<br />\nmore than $85 per ton to send its<br /><br />\ngarbage to an incinerator or a<br />\nlandfill. Since the market pays for<br />\nwhite paper, aluminum, and<br />\nglass, and takes cardboard, tin<br />\nand low-grade paper for free, if<br />\nHopkins recycled this 63 percent<br />\nof its waste stream, it would save<br />\nover $40,000 each year.<br />\nNot only does recycling work<br />\non an institutional level, but some<br />\nstates and cities have found<br /><br />\nA pungent look at the<br />\nHopkins garbage situation<br /><br />\nrecycling to be an economic<br />\nboon. New York's bottle bill,<br />\nwhich puts a deposit on each bottle, saved New York $50 million<br />\nin clean-up costs, $19 million in<br />\nsolid waste costs, and bettween<br />\n$50 and $100 million in energy<br />\ncosts. Because of the bottle bill<br />\nin Iowa, 92 percent of bottles sold<br />\nin Iowa are reused or recycled.<br />\nMany places have curbside<br />\nrecycling, where one puts out<br />\nrecycleables in a special container<br />\nnext to one's garbage. In parts of<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\nNew Jersey, resident are only<br />\nallowed one can of garbage. Having an additional can picked up<br />\ncosts $3 per can per week. These<br />\nmeasures have helped New<br />\nJersey recycle 50 percent of its<br />\nwaste stream. Seattle has a<br />\nsimilar program and currently<br />\nrecycles 34 percent of its waste.<br />\nSeattle's goal is to recycle 60 percent of its waste by 1998.<br />\nWhy not in Baltimore? The<br />\nBaltimore recycling plan has<br />\nstarted curbside recycling in two<br />\nof twenty zones. A Baltimore<br />\ncommunity group sponsors rolloffs located around the city which<br />\ntake recycleables every Saturday.<br />\nBut Baltimore's goal is only 20<br />\npercent of the waste stream, and<br />\nincluded in that goal is energy<br />\ngenerated by the incinerator.<br />\nHopkins reached its first goal of<br />\n25 percent in six months. WE<br />\nnow know that we can reach a<br />\nmuch higher goal of 63 percent.<br />\nThere are plans currently being<br /><br />\ndiscussed between SEA and<br />\nCustodial Services which aim to<br />\nreach that goal. But Baltimore<br />\nwill be satisfied with 20 percent,<br />\ncounting incinerated garbage as<br />\nas part of that miniscule goal.<br />\nOf course, the real problem is<br />\nthat most of the garbage we<br />\ngenerate isn't necessary at all.<br />\nWhen SEA was doing its study,<br />\nstudents found pads of unused<br />\npaper and many other unused<br />\nitems.

In summary:<br />\n1) The courses should be based on the specific areas of advanced graduate students' expertise. This will best meet the needs<br />\nboth of the graduate student<br />\nteacher, and of undergraduates<br />\nwho will benefit from the<br />\nteacher's strength in the subject<br />\ntaught, and from the widening of<br />\nthe curriculum. It would be a<br />\npoor use of the Teaching<br />\nFellowship to employ it, as one<br />\nchair has proposed (News-Letter,<br />\nFeb 22, 1991) to add extra sections to existing classes, or to<br />\nhave graduate students teach existing classes that would otherwise be taught by faculty.

There is a new<br />\nlevel of awareness of gender in<br /><br />\nat least some parts of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity at the moment, partly due to the recent establishment<br />\nof the Women's Studies program<br />\nand the arrival of Professor Judy<br />\nWalkowitz as its director.

This gene codes for the<br />\nprotein Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrance Conductance Regulator or<br />\nCFTR. The mutation in the gene<br />\ncauses an altered form of CFTR<br />\nin CF patients. Researchers<br />\noriginally believed that the complete absence of this gene would<br />\nlead to the severest form of<br />\nCFTR. But the new finding suggests that the altered form of<br />\nCFTR may be more damaging<br />\nthan a missing one. A study of 17<br />\nblack and 25 white American patients found that two of them had<br />\na form of mutation different from<br />\nthe one most common in CF patients.

The Jays,<br />\n12-4-2 entering the game (but<br />\nundefeated since resuming play<br />\nafter winter break) and playing<br />\nfor the second consecutive night,<br />\nwere challenging the undefeated<br />\n(16-0-1) Tigers of Towson State<br />\nUniversity, who had not played<br />\nin four days. Towson had beaten<br />\nHopkins during both previous<br />\nmeetings in November but<br />\ntonight was a new game. The<br />\n\"visiting\" Jays, playing spirited<br />\nhockey sin,ce the break, defeated<br />\nTowson 5-4 to win their first<br />\nleague championship behind the<br />\nplay of game MVP Jason<br />\nSprague. While the area was filled to capacity with mostly Tiger<br />\nfans, the vocal Hopkins contingent remained until after the<br />\ntrophy presentation in a rousing<br />\ntribute<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nteam's<br />\naccomplishments.<br />\nIn only their fourth season,<br />\nHopkins returned to the championshp game for the second<br />\nstraight year. After losing to<br />\nGeorgetown last year, the Jays<br />\nwere determined to win the title<br />\nthis year. Although TSU grabbed the opening faceoff and popped three quick shots, team captain senior Dave Bowyer, playing his final game in goal for the<br />\nBlue Jays, established himself as<br />\na force in the net before Hopkins<br />\ncleared the puck and began to<br />\ntake the offensive. Just 1:20 into<br />\nthe game, Sprague blasted a shot<br />\nthat Tiger goalie John Poisal easily saved. However, the rebound<br />\npopped right back to Sprague<br />\nwho flipped it in for his first goal<br />\nof the game, giving the Jays an<br />\nearly 1-0 lead. The game continued at a furious pace for nearly ten minutes with each team<br /><br />\ngenerating break chances or<br />\nmismatches, but each time<br />\nBowyer and Poisal came up with<br />\nbig saves or the defenses<br />\nrecovered in time to poke the<br />\npuck away.<br />\nAt the 2:30 mark, Towson<br />\ndeveloped a one-on-none break at<br />\nthe red line. The Tiger skater carried the puck toward Bowyer in<br />\nwhat looked like a penalty shot attempt until Bowyer stopped the<br />\nshot and the Jays recovered to<br />\nclear. As Towson tried to<br />\npressure the goal, Sprague intercepted a Tiger pass at the blue<br />\nline and carried the puck in for<br />\na backhander that sprawled Poisal<br />\non the ice. The Jays picked up the<br />\nrebound and John Tymkewicz<br />\nregistered his second assist as he<br />\nslipped the puck back to Sprague<br />\nfor his second goal of the game<br />\nat 1:49 of the first period. By outshooting Towson 11-7 in the<br />\nperiod, Hopkins led 2-0 at the end<br />\nof one.<br />\nTowson got a quick three-ontwo advantage to start the second<br />\nperiod but the Tigers fell victim<br />\nto more of their poor passing and<br />\nblew the advantage without even<br />\ngetting a shot. After coincidental<br />\nminors were called for delay of<br />\ngame, both teams skated a foura-side and Hopkins seemed to<br />\ntake the advantage. Once again,<br />\nTymkewicz fed Sprague, who<br />\nthis time tipped the puck wide and<br />\nthe Towson squad finally connected on a long pass by springing a player for a good scoring<br />\nchance. With 0:41 still remaining<br />\nin the four-on-four time, Hopkins<br />\ndefenseman Phil Schied got back<br />\nand tripped up the Towson skater,<br />\nbreaking up the scoring chance<br />\nand earning two minutes in the<br />\npenalty box. While on the power<br />\nplay, TSU set up a great chance<br />\nby sending the puck to a player<br />\nin the slot who fanned. Towson<br />\nsent the puck back to the point<br />\nwhere they fired a shot that was<br /><br />\ndeflected in front of the goal.<br />\nWith Bowyer down and a mass<br />\nof bodies falling around the goal,<br />\nthe Towson fans cheered, one of<br />\ntheir forwards raised his stick and<br />\nthe referee even raised one arm to<br />\nsignal a goal until he realized that<br />\nBowyer had just made a<br />\nremarkable save. The Jays killed the rest of the penalty in the<br />\nTowson end to preserve the 2-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nTowson went on trying<br />\nnumerous shots from the blue line<br />\nbut were usually way off the<br />\nmark. Even when their shots<br />\nwere in the general direction of<br />\nthe goal, they seemed to have so<br />\nmany skaters in front of the net<br />\nthat the puck would be knocked<br />\ndown, deflected away, or intercepted before it ever got to the<br />\ngoal. Towson finally scored on<br />\none of these screens as Carey<br />\nMorrison tipped in a shot from<br />\nthe point at 8:38 of the second<br />\nperiod. Hopkins came back 90<br />\nseconds later as Sprague initiated<br />\na two-on-one that developed into a one-on-none after his shot<br />\nwas saved. Sophomore Wells<br />\nDixon, streaking in unguarded,<br />\ngrabbed the rebound and flipped<br />\nit in to regain a two-goal advantage for the Jays. Shortly after the<br />\nteam's third goal, Patrick<br />\nChiasson, using his incredible<br />\nskating ability, grabbed a loose<br />\npuck, came in, and drilled a slap<br />\nshot from forty feet out. Poisal<br />\nsaved the blast with his face and<br />\nthen fell back into the net like a<br />\ndomino.<br />\nHopkins' size advantage started<br />\nto become apparent as many of<br />\nthe Blue Jay skaters used the body<br />\nto take Towson players off the<br />\npuck. When Towson did gain an<br />\nadvantage, they usually failed to<br />\nmake the extra pass to set up an<br />\nopen shot and ended up flying into the boards or dropping to the<br />\nice under crunching checks by<br />\nCraig Hampton, Dave Boxen-<br /><br />\nbaum, Chad Holien, Malcolm<br />\nLloyd, Hooper Conrad, Schied,<br />\nTymkewicz and Sprague.<br />\nAttempting to avoid the<br />\nthunderous checks, the Tigers<br />\ncontinued to shoot wide and failed to put the puck on goal. With<br />\nnine seconds remaining in the<br />\nperiod, Hopkins then got what<br />\nappeared to be the back-breaker<br />\nas Sprague got out on a breakaway and converted the chance<br />\nfor a hat-trick. His third goal of<br />\nthe game came as Towson tried<br />\nto pressure the Jays' net and he<br />\nblocked a shot, went streaking out<br />\nover the blue line, held off a<br />\nhooking defender, faked Poisal<br />\nand scored a short-side<br />\nbackhander for a 4-1 lead at the<br />\nend of two.<br />\nWith a record of 23-5-1 at Mt.<br />\nPleasant Arena, undefeated this<br />\nyear, and a skating Tiger mascot<br />\nto excite them, Towson fans were<br />\ncertain their Tigers were not out<br />\nof the game yet. Not disappointing them, Towson came out and<br />\nscored thirteen seconds into the<br />\nthird period on a scramble in<br />\nfront. Two minutes later Towson<br />\nscored again and suddenly the<br />\nJays' three-goal lead was cut to<br />\none. Just fourteen seconds later,<br />\nHooper Conrad blasted a shot<br />\nfrom the point and the Jays' lead<br />\nwas back to two at 5-3.<br />\nThe goal that proved to be the<br />\ngame winner slowed the Tigers'<br />\nmomentum until they got a great<br />\nchance while shorthanded. Blocking a Blue Jay shot at the blue<br />\nline, Towson came in on a break,<br />\nbut Bowyer sprawled low on the<br />\nice and came up with a big save<br />\nto keep the Jays emotionally<br />\ncharged. After recovering from<br />\nthe miscuse, Hopkins forced the<br />\nplay and maintained solid<br />\npressure throughout the balance<br />\nof the power play. As the penalized player came back for the<br />\nTigers, he received a pass wide<br />\nContinued on page 15<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\n4,...<br />\n,ois.11<br />\ne ' 1st\u2014<br />\n1<br />\n\u201e,;; 14\u2022<br />\n..;;;;::::<br />\n- ,.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 :::\u2022<br />\nle\u201e,.0<br />\ns,o.ov,.\".1<br />\nI<br /><br />\n,<br />\nor<br /><br />\n:.!!!4:.<br />\n, ..;tir tom ee,:s<br />\n. 1 1::::!.4<br />\n.... \u2022 11.00<br />\nassom-.1.<br />\n,<br />\n....<br />\n_die<br />\nloss.'14111<br />\nvigi,<br />\n,,,*<br />\n:: ..k.<br /><br />\norWOWO*1*.,<br />\n,<br /><br />\nOti.14<br />\n*a 0.<br /><br />\n,40<br />\nMidfielder Keith Gertsen protects goalie Ian Hobbs in home opener.<br /><br />\nMen's Lacrosse Loses<br />\nTough Home Opener<br />\nby Jay Friedman<br />\nHomewood,Saturday, March 2<br />\nThe Seaman Era of Hopkins<br />\nLacrosse suffered a setback today<br />\nas the Blue Jays opened the 1991<br />\nseason the same way they ended<br />\nthe 1990 campaign, losing to<br />\nPrinceton before a disappointed<br />\ncrowd of 5000.

The<br />\n1991 Jays, who trounced Coppin<br />\nState 19-5 and whipped<br />\nDivision I UMBC 13-8, may actually be improved over the 1990<br />\nedition, which won twenty-eight<br />\nof its thirty-nine contests.<br />\nJeff Fang (5-2 last year)<br />\nrecorded the victory against Coppin State, pitching five innings<br />\nand allowing four runs. Fang's<br />\ncause was greatly aided by the<br />\nJays' offensive attack, which exploded for seven runs in the bottom of the fifth inning. A pair of<br />\nsenior outfielders, Ken Kroczenski (.276 last season) and Ken<br />\nBrodkowitz(.303)combined for<br />\nsix hits and three RBI's.<br />\nSophomore Matt Menz (.474 in<br />\nonly 19 AB's) provided the<br />\npower, stroking a long home run.<br />\nAlthough the fourteen-run<br />\ntriumph was certainly impressive,<br />\nit gave little insight as to the<br />\nquality of the JHU squad.<br />\nJunior Bill Paukovits, who pitched in relief in the Coppin State<br />\ngame, was surprised that Coppin<br />\nState did not provide more of a<br />\nchallenge. \"Talentwise, they're<br />\na good team, but they seemed undisciplined.\"<br />\nThough the Jays remember losing to the Division I Retrievers<br />\nlast year, they put that behind<br /><br />\nthem and came up with a solid<br />\nvictory. Behind two more circuitclouts from Menz, and a grand<br />\nslam from Brodkowitz, the Jays'<br />\noffense never let up. The multiple home runs, however, might<br />\nbe attributed to the fence being<br />\nmoved in closer. Brodkowitz, as<br />\na pitcher and rightfielder, had<br />\nmixed feelings about this change,<br />\nbut he admitted that \"since we<br />\nhave a lot of power, but lack<br />\nspeed, this could help us win<br />\nclose games.\"<br />\nJoe Tortorello, a sophomore,<br />\nwas the starter and winner for<br />\nHopkins. He, like Fang, pitched<br />\njust well enough to win, working<br />\nhis way out of several dangerous<br />\njams, with support from a reliable<br />\ndefense. Whenever UMBC was<br />\nable to scratch out a few runs, the<br />\nHopkins line-up responded by<br />\nwidening its lead.<br />\nMenz, who pitches and plays<br />\nfirst base, commented on the importance of the win against a<br />\nDivision I team. \"This was a<br />\nreally big win for us, since we're<br />\na really young team. It gives us<br />\nsomething to build upon to have<br />\na good season.\"<br />\nJunior Mike Fraser, starting second baseman, was quick to<br />\nagree. \"We were confident going into the UMBC game after we<br />\nplayed well against Coppin State.<br />\nWe expected good pitching from<br />\nUMBC, but the first pitcher was<br />\na little bit wild. and we took advantage of that.\"<br /><br />\nas seniors Matt Panetta and Mike<br />\nMorrissey hooked up for a goal<br />\njust two minutes into the game.<br />\nMorrissey added his second only twenty-eight seconds later,<br />\nprompting Princeton coach and<br />\nSeaman's close friend Bill<br />\nTierney to take a time-out(much<br />\nlike last year's playoffs).

But then it<br />\nwas the Blue Jays' goalie Scott<br />\nGiardina who disappointed<br />\neveryone by missing the first shot<br />\nat him, a fifteen-yarder from<br />\nHighley Thompson. The Hopkins<br />\nattack came back for a goal by<br />\nPanetta, restoring the two-goal<br />\nlead and prompting chants of<br />\n\"the goalie's a sieve\" toward<br />\nBacigalupo. Giardina came up<br />\nwith a big save on a point-blank<br />\nshot and appeared ready to step<br />\nforward as the 'Jays' post-Quint<br />\ngoalie until the teams traded<br />\ngoals. With 35 seconds left in the<br />\nfirst quarter, Hopkins had a solid<br />\n4-2 lead but back-to-back goals at<br />\n14:26 and seven seconds later, off<br />\nthe ensuing faceoff, tied it up for<br />\nthe Tigers and gave them an emotional lift heading into the start of<br />\nthe second period.<br />\nAfter three minutes of play,<br />\nHopkins tri-captain Seth Tierney<br />\nset up a goal with a great pass to<br />\nDrew Burns who received the<br />\nball on the _crease, faked and<br />\nscored. That was the last time<br />\n\"we wanted more\" for twentysix minutes as the Tigers went on<br />\na seven-goal spurt. After three<br />\nstraight goals and back-to-back<br />\nscores by Hopkins-killer Justin<br />\nTortolani eleven seconds apart,<br />\nSeaman made a tough decision.<br />\nThe Hopkins coach pulled Giardina, who likened his own performance to swiss cheese, in<br />\nfavor of Ian Hobbs. While Hobbs<br />\nregistered nine saves on the afternoon, he did not fare much better, allowing eight goals including<br />\nfour more before Burns finally<br />\nbroke the Blue Jays' scoring<br />\ndrought with 33 seconds left in<br />\nthe third quarter.<br />\nDuring the Princeton onslaught<br />\nin the second and third quarters,<br />\nHopkins actually recovered more<br />\nground balls but had an average<br />\noffensive time of possession that<br />\napproached zip due to<br />\nthrowaways, errant passes,<br />\ndefensive strips and general poor<br />\ndecisions. During that time, the<br />\nJays lost one more faceoff than<br />\nthey won, were outshot thirty-one<br />\nto twelve, but most importantly<br />\nwere outscored 7-2.<br />\nDuring Princeton's dominating<br />\nstretch it appeared that many<br />\nHopkins players, particularly the<br />\nmiddies, were pressing, trying to<br />\nbe the one to get the team over<br />\nthe hump. However, the one-onone play of several Blue Jays<br />\nresulted in poor shot selection and<br />\neasy saves for Bacigalupo. Indeed, after the game many people were talking as though<br />\nBacigalupo was the only reason<br />\nPrinceton ever had a chance. To<br />\nthe coiatary, the Princeton offense controlled the ball for so<br />\nlong that when the Jays had the<br />\nball, they did not seem<br />\nto know what to do. Shots from<br />\nlong range or sharp angles meant<br />\nthat Bacigalupo hardly had to<br />\nmove to pick the balls out of the<br />\nair. When Bacigalupo got away<br />\na breakout pass, Princeton scored<br />\non fast break advantages.<br />\nHowever, more often Bacigalupo<br />\nset up a clear and the Hopkins<br />\nride was successful in defending<br />\nContinued on page 14<br /><br />\n14/MARCH 8, 1991<br /><br />\nFencing Dominates UAA<br />\nby Ethan Skolnick<br />\nAfter his 17-3 fencing squad's<br />\nsolid performance in the February<br />\n23rd UAA Championships,<br />\nCoach Richard Oles decided to<br />\ntry his luck at prognosticating.<br />\n\"I don't know how well the<br />\nsabre and foil teams will do next<br />\nweekend fat the March 2nd.<br />\nNCAA Regionals] because we're<br />\nreally not that familiar with the<br />\nRegional format or competition,\"<br />\nOles said. \"But, I think the epee<br />\nteam has a chance to finish in the<br />\ntop two.\"<br />\nIf his run with Blue Jay fencing ever ends, Oles could always<br />\nfind work as a fortune-teller.<br />\nWhile the foil and sabre teams did<br />\nindeed struggle at the eight-team<br />\nRegional tournament (finishing<br />\neight and seventh, respectively),<br />\nthe epee squad turned in a dazzling second-place effort.<br />\nFeaturing Jorge Gana, Jason<br />\nColeman, and Timothy Train, the<br />\nepee squad made a major state-<br /><br />\nment about the quality of Johns<br />\nHopkins fencing.

Gana, the<br />\njunior captain, followed last<br />\nweek's 1st-place UAA finish with<br />\nanother strong performance.<br />\nColeman, also a junior, had been<br />\n3rd at the UAA's, and fenced<br />\nwell once again. Perhaps the key<br />\ncontributor, however, was Train,<br />\na senior. Last year, Train was the<br />\nDivision III epee champion, but<br />\nhe had previously participated in<br />\nonly foil competition during the<br />\n1991 campaign.

Once<br />\nagain, Hopkins was unable to put<br />\nthe ball into the try zone. Their<br />\ndefense, however, kept the potent<br />\nSt. Mary's club out of the try<br />\nzone for much of the game. The<br />\nfinal score stood at 4-0, St.<br />\nMary's. In the first half, both ball<br />\nclubs were able to drive deep into their opponent's territory<br />\nseveral times, but neither club<br />\nwas able to score. Much of the<br />\nsecond half proceeded the same<br />\nway until 25 minutes into the<br />\ngame. St. Mary's was close to<br />\nHopkins' try zone, but was<br />\nunable to score in three sustained drives.

Unfortunately, any emotion<br />\nthe Jays could have generated<br />\nquickly evaporated as the Tigers<br />\nscored seventeen seconds into the<br />\nfourth quarter. Wills came back<br />\nto score for the Jays before<br />\nTierney added his second and<br />\nAdam Wright scored two.<br />\nHowever, it was a case of too little, too late.<br />\nFor the Jays to be successful,<br />\nthe middies will have to wctrk on<br />\nmoving without the ball and getting it to players behind the cage<br />\nto set up the offense. Seaman<br />\nobserved that classifying a game<br />\nas upbeat might not best suit the<br />\ncurrent Hopkins squad. Ball control at certain times, such as<br />\nPrinceton's run, might better help<br />\nsettle a frustrated offensive team.<br />\nAlthough Princeton was a<br />\nphysically faster team, Dwan<br />\nnoted that it's not the speed that<br />\nmakes the difference but the<br />\nheart. \"We have to hustle, get the<br />\nground balls, prevent turnovers<br />\nand use some ball control. We<br />\njust played defense for too long,\"<br />\ncommented Dwan. It sounds like<br />\nHopkins can take a page out of<br />\nthe New York Giants playbook.<br />\nEstablish an early lead, play<br />\ntough defense, especially in goal,<br />\ncontrol the ball and capitalize on<br /><br />\ntheir opponents' failures when<br />\npressing to catch up. \u2014 We have<br />\nto rebound and move on and not<br />\ndwell on this game. We're still<br />\nadjusting to a new system and<br />\nthere are ten games left,\" Dwan<br />\nconcluded.<br />\nAfter Giardina and Hobbs were<br />\nscorched for fifteen goals, the<br />\nstarting job will be decided in<br />\npractice. Expect Giardina to have<br />\na slight edge since it is tough to<br />\nreplace a starter after one game<br />\nunless the backup performs<br />\noutstandingly. Additionally, the<br />\nmidfield will have to make better decisions with and without the<br />\nball. One area in which the midfield suffered terribly was getting<br />\nout of position and being beaten<br />\non fast break clears or unsettled<br />\nsituations. Seaman will work with<br />\nthe midfielders trying to teach<br />\nthem to recognize certain situations and the appropriate<br />\nresponse. \"We definitely learned some things about ourselves<br />\nand what we can do,\" concluded Seaman. Finally, one area<br />\nover which the team has little<br />\ncontrol and much to be concerned about is officiating. Hopkins<br />\nusually has the same incompetent<br />\ncrew for most of their home<br />\ngames. The only consolation<br />\nmight be that they missed calls<br />\nboth ways, although the bad calls<br />\n(or no-calls) hurt the Jays far<br />\nmore than the Tigers.<br /><br />\n13IA NOTES<br />\nminton tournament: Vincent/Willard topped Hollander<br />\nto win the dormitories:<br />\nSylvester came in third.
