In his exposition of the<br />\n\"Laws of Adsorption,\" the physicist<br />\nelaborated the older theory into a<br />\nnew and more general concept,<br />\nwhich he supported by experimental<br />\ndata.<br />\nDisowns Formula<br />\nIn discussing the use of the<br />\nformula which bears his name, the<br />\n\"Langmuir adsorption isotherm,\"<br />\nDr. Langmuir protested that he had<br />\nnot developed this formula himself,<br />\nbut merely taken it from previous<br />\nwork and applied it in a special<br />\ncase. The formula is used in determining the force of attraction in<br />\ncertain cases of adsorption.<br />\nOne of the adsorptive phenomena<br />\nwhich Dr. Langmuir's theory explains is the tremendous force with<br />\nwhich tungsten holds oxygen. At a<br />\ntemperature of 1,800 degrees absolute it would take three and onehalf years to completely vaporize<br />\nthe surface layer of oxygen molecules, he explained. The industrially important silica jel, an incompletely dehydrated silicic acid developed by Dr. Patrick here at the<br />\nHopkins also depends upon the adsorption phenomenon for its efficiency.<br />\n---o---<br />\n<br />\nM.

In his exposition of the<br />\n\"Laws of Adsorption,\" the physicist<br />\nelaborated the older theory into a<br />\nnew and more general concept,<br />\nwhich he supported by experimental<br />\ndata.<br />\nDisowns Formula<br />\nIn discussing the use of the<br />\nformula which bears his name, the<br />\n\"Langmuir adsorption isotherm,\"<br />\nDr. Langmuir protested that he had<br />\nnot developed this formula himself,<br />\nbut merely taken it from previous<br />\nwork and applied it in a special<br />\ncase. The formula is used in determining the force of attraction in<br />\ncertain cases of adsorption.<br />\nOne of the adsorptive phenomena<br />\nwhich Dr. Langmuir's theory explains is the tremendous force with<br />\nwhich tungsten holds oxygen. At a<br />\ntemperature of 1,800 degrees absolute it would take three and onehalf years to completely vaporize<br />\nthe surface layer of oxygen molecules, he explained. The industrially important silica jel, an incompletely dehydrated silicic acid developed by Dr. Patrick here at the<br />\nHopkins also depends upon the adsorption phenomenon for its efficiency.<br />\n---o---<br /><br />\nM.
