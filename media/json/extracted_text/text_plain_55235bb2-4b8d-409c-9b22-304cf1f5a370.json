XIV. No. 30.<br />\nTHE MEDICAL REUNION<br />\nThe first reunion of the graduates<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Medicat School<br />\nand Hospital has come and gone. The<br />\nocccasion was successsful Leyond all<br />\nanticipation. Thirteen classes have<br />\ngraduated in medicine since the opening of the Medical School in 1893,<br />\nand all the classes from 1893 to 1909<br />\nwere well represented at the reunion.<br />\nNearly two hundred men were present. Not only were many delightful<br />\nreminiscences realled, but the occasion proved of much general interest<br />\nand seemed to be of such importance<br />\nto the University as to warrant a<br />\nrather extensive description in the<br />\n\"News-Letter.\"<br />\nThe reunion was planned for Friday and Saturday, May 6th and 7th,<br />\nimmediately following the meetings<br />\nin Washington of the Congress of<br />\nPhysicians and Surgeons which it<br />\nwas thought many of the graduates<br />\nwould attend. Weeks before careful<br />\nplans had been made. The medical<br />\nmembers of the Alumni Council appointed temporary secretaries for<br />\neach class. In addition to the formal<br />\nnotices these secretaries wrote per\u2014<br />\nsonal letters to the members of their<br />\nclass urging their attendance at the<br />\nreunion. l'erhaps these preliminaries<br />\nwere not necessary. We found that<br />\nthe graduates almost unanimously approved holding the reunion, and all<br />\nwhose work would permit agreed to<br />\n.come. As college men they knew<br />\nwhat alumni reunions were and con'eluded at once that this first gathering of the members of the Johns<br />\nHopkins medical clan was to mark<br />\nan epoch in the history of the school<br />\nand the University.<br />\nThe festivities began at ten o'clock<br />\non Friday morning with a general<br />\nmeeting in the Medical amphitheatre.<br />\nThe room was crowded. Dr. Barker<br />\npresided, and in graceful phrases<br />\nspoke of the pleasure of the faculty<br />\nin welcoming so many of the graduates back and of the pride which the<br />\nfaculty took in the good work of so<br />\nmany of the former students. He<br />\nthen read a letter from President<br />\nRemsen, who regretted exceedingly<br />\nhis inability to respond in person.<br />\nThe president emphasised the intimate association which had always<br />\nexisted between the University and<br />\nthe Medical School and acknowledged<br />\nthe debt which the University owed<br />\nto its Medical Department. He believed that a good medical school<br />\nwas only possible in connection with<br />\na university, and he hoped that the<br />\nmedical alumni present here would<br />\nrealize that much of the spirit and<br />\n,T\u2018nthusiasm which they had displayed<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, Md., June 13, 1910.<br />\n<br />\nPrice, 5 cents per copy.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Hooker: Demonstration of<br />\nin their search for truth and in their the spark of genius, the ability to disnew apparatus for perfusing the kiddaily work always characterized the cover.<br />\nFollowing the addresses of wel- ney.<br />\nwork of the University at large.<br />\nDr. Snyder: Demonstration of the<br />\nDr. Brown, ti,e chairman of<br />\ncome<br />\nresponded<br />\nDr. Howell, the Dean,<br />\nfor the medical faculty.

XIV. No. 30.<br />\nTHE MEDICAL REUNION<br />\nThe first reunion of the graduates<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Medicat School<br />\nand Hospital has come and gone. The<br />\nocccasion was successsful Leyond all<br />\nanticipation. Thirteen classes have<br />\ngraduated in medicine since the opening of the Medical School in 1893,<br />\nand all the classes from 1893 to 1909<br />\nwere well represented at the reunion.<br />\nNearly two hundred men were present. Not only were many delightful<br />\nreminiscences realled, but the occasion proved of much general interest<br />\nand seemed to be of such importance<br />\nto the University as to warrant a<br />\nrather extensive description in the<br />\n\"News-Letter.\"<br />\nThe reunion was planned for Friday and Saturday, May 6th and 7th,<br />\nimmediately following the meetings<br />\nin Washington of the Congress of<br />\nPhysicians and Surgeons which it<br />\nwas thought many of the graduates<br />\nwould attend. Weeks before careful<br />\nplans had been made. The medical<br />\nmembers of the Alumni Council appointed temporary secretaries for<br />\neach class. In addition to the formal<br />\nnotices these secretaries wrote per\u2014<br />\nsonal letters to the members of their<br />\nclass urging their attendance at the<br />\nreunion. l'erhaps these preliminaries<br />\nwere not necessary. We found that<br />\nthe graduates almost unanimously approved holding the reunion, and all<br />\nwhose work would permit agreed to<br />\n.come. As college men they knew<br />\nwhat alumni reunions were and con'eluded at once that this first gathering of the members of the Johns<br />\nHopkins medical clan was to mark<br />\nan epoch in the history of the school<br />\nand the University.<br />\nThe festivities began at ten o'clock<br />\non Friday morning with a general<br />\nmeeting in the Medical amphitheatre.<br />\nThe room was crowded. Dr. Barker<br />\npresided, and in graceful phrases<br />\nspoke of the pleasure of the faculty<br />\nin welcoming so many of the graduates back and of the pride which the<br />\nfaculty took in the good work of so<br />\nmany of the former students. He<br />\nthen read a letter from President<br />\nRemsen, who regretted exceedingly<br />\nhis inability to respond in person.<br />\nThe president emphasised the intimate association which had always<br />\nexisted between the University and<br />\nthe Medical School and acknowledged<br />\nthe debt which the University owed<br />\nto its Medical Department. He believed that a good medical school<br />\nwas only possible in connection with<br />\na university, and he hoped that the<br />\nmedical alumni present here would<br />\nrealize that much of the spirit and<br />\n,T\u2018nthusiasm which they had displayed<br /><br />\nBaltimore, Md., June 13, 1910.<br /><br />\nPrice, 5 cents per copy.<br /><br />\nDr. Hooker: Demonstration of<br />\nin their search for truth and in their the spark of genius, the ability to disnew apparatus for perfusing the kiddaily work always characterized the cover.<br />\nFollowing the addresses of wel- ney.<br />\nwork of the University at large.<br />\nDr. Snyder: Demonstration of the<br />\nDr. Brown, ti,e chairman of<br />\ncome<br />\nresponded<br />\nDr. Howell, the Dean,<br />\nfor the medical faculty.
