ROFESSOR<br />\n<br />\nJACKSON'S lectures on Persian Poetry, delivered on<br />\nthe Turnbull Foundation, are over. It is a remarkable tribute to a<br />\nman's powers as a lecturer when we consider how closely and personally Professor Jackson brought home to us the lives and work of<br />\nthe poets of far-away Siram. A possibly more remarkable tribute was<br />\npaid to the memory of Omar. Last Wednesday week, in the midst<br />\nof a driving snow-storm a throng which crowded McCoy Hall to the<br />\ndoors came to hear the lecture on Omar and his predecessors. It is<br />\nperhaps worht mentioning that at least two members of English<br />\nVA.-- :..' *4sile\u2022<br />\nLiterature I, thought last week that Chaucer's reference to \"Omer\"<br />\nreferred not to the greatest Grecian Poet, but to the best-known poet of Persia!<br />\nThe course was interesting; at times fascinating.

The state of the floor was, dreadful,\u2014not that it was not<br />\nsmooth enough,\u2014but both in the hall itself and in the corridor there<br />\nwas a great deal of dust and dirt. Fortunate was the girl who had<br />\nno train! Then, too, why should the dances begin before nine?<br />\nThey never do begin at eight-thirty, as scheduled. Most people will<br />\nnot come so early, and the first half hour must be decidedly dreary<br />\nfor those who do happen to come on time. Still, in spite of these<br />\nobjections, the dance was decidedly a success.<br />\n<br />\nAn issue of the NEws-LETTER should have appeared last Friday, but Editors, like other<br />\nmortals, are liable to fail, particularly when the Dean's and other essays are on our hands.<br />\n.We regret the unavoidable delay, which we trust will not occur again, this year at any rate.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., January 27, 1908.<br />\nThe Editor of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University:<br />\nMY DEAR SIR :\u2014In order to enable the track sports at the University to maintain their<br />\nposition with the other spring sport, Lacrosse, and bring forth candidates who will by their<br />\nwork in the different sets of gatnes held at times during the winter and spring months, we<br />\nhave this proposition to make to the under-classmen: That a relay race between teams selected<br />\nfrom the Junior and Freshman Classes be run at the set of games to be held by the 'Varsity<br />\nTrack Team on February 29th, 1908, for which we offer medals to the winning team.<br />\nThis is done so that more enthusiasm may be brought forth in favor of track sports,<br />\nand aid the coach and captain in getting out candidates for the track squad from the underclasses.<br />\nThe conditions upon which we make the above offer, are as follows:<br />\n(1). That the candidates for each of said teams shall become candidates of the 'Varsity<br />\nTrack Squad, and shall train regularly under the direction of the 'Varsity coach and captain.<br />\n(2). That the teams shall be picked by the track coach and 'Varsity captain, and in so<br />\ndoing they shall have just as much reference to the candidates' attendance at practice and<br />\nfaithfulness at training as the running ability.<br />\n(3). That each team shall be composed of four men.<br />\n(4). That the distance of said race shall be one mile.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nR. CURZON HOFFMAN, JR.,<br />\nW. CORNWELL SMITH,ARTHUR R.

STEWART.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nA VISITOR.<br />\nThe past summer had many bright days for<br />\nme, for I spent June, July, August, and<br />\nSeptember on my father's farm in Frederick<br />\nCounty. The day which will always remain<br />\nin my memory as the never-to-be-forgotten,<br />\nfun-giving day is that on which \"My Visitor,\"<br />\nas my father calls him, came.<br />\nIn the early morning and forenoon I worked<br />\nin the fields, hay-making, and in return for<br />\nmy morning's labor I was promised the use of<br />\nour excellent riding horse for that evening.<br />\nIn the afternoon I noticed my horse had lost<br />\na shoe, so I took him down to the village to<br />\nbe shod. While waiting at the blacksmithshop, I was called over to the country store<br />\nto get a 'phone .message. This message was<br />\nrather strange; \"Tell Mr. Mun a y that<br />\nSo-and-so will be up on the evening train,\"<br />\nthe clerk said that he did not catch the name.<br />\nAfter attending to some errands in the<br />\nvillage, I rode out to my home and delivered<br />\nthe message. No one in the family had given<br />\nany one out of the vicinity an invitation and<br />\nno one knew who was coming and we all were<br />\nmore or less amused at the curtness of such a.<br />\nmessage. Much to my sorrow I was informed<br />\nthat they would need the horse promised me,<br />\nsince he was what we termed the \"station<br />\nwagon horse,\" to take the large dayton to the<br />\nstation and bring back the visitors. No one<br />\nknew whether there really was anyone coming<br />\nor someone was one playing a joke on us so<br />\nwe prepared for three people. The spare<br />\nrooms were all ready, supper on the table for<br />\nthe guests, or rather, unexpected visitors, and<br />\neverything was prepared for their arrival.<br />\nAbout time for the train to come in the<br />\nman drove down with my horse and the<br />\nstation wagon. When the train came in he<br />\nlooked around for our visitors but none came<br />\nand he was just about to drive off when the<br />\nfreight agent called out. Here's your party.<br />\nOf course, the whole family was anxious to<br />\nknow who was coming and all were out<br />\nwatching for their arrival. I, being a little<br />\nmore anxious and put out than the rest, was<br />\nthe first to find out that no one was on the<br />\nfront seat of the wagon but the driver. I ran<br />\nout to the front and asked who it was and he<br />\nsaid, \"They are in the back.\" I looked and<br />\nsaw only a crate and asked him \"Where?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"There,\" said he, pointing to the box I took<br />\nit out and in doing so my hand slipped in a<br />\ncrack and touched a fuzzy, hairy something<br />\nwhich gave a low whine. Then it dawned<br />\nupon me what it was. It was a through-bred<br />\nSt. Bernard puppy promised me by a friend<br />\nsometime before. While very much put out<br />\nand provoked, the whole family at once saw<br />\nthe funny side of the affair and my mother<br />\nsaid, \"My best bed linen all put out on the<br />\nbeds for a dog.\"<br />\nI however, was not disappointed, for after<br />\nI had made my dog comfortable I went and<br />\ngot my horse and had a long, beautiful, and<br />\nnever-to-be-forgotten horseback ride.\u2014M.<br />\n<br />\nTHE DANCE.<br />\nThe second dance of the Cotillon Club was<br />\nheld on Friday, the thirty-first of January.<br />\nFrom the point of view of the students, it was<br />\none of the most successful ever given. Everybody was there, and \"everybody was happy.\"<br />\nOld and distinguished Alumni danced<br />\naround and bumped into green young Freshmen and then the Freshmen, not to be outdone,<br />\nbumped into them. A few professors were<br />\nthere, and great excitement was aroused when<br />\na foolish Junior broke up one of them. Suppressed whispers were heard in the hall, and<br />\nthe young lady who was broken up remarked<br />\nin a wise tone:<br />\n\"I'll bet you flunk your next French<br />\nexam.\"<br />\nOf course, we can't say just who the professor was, but that night he wore his usual<br />\ncheery smile.<br />\nAnd then there was the barn dance. Some<br />\nknew it and some didn't, but everybody danced<br />\nit. A few beginners got tumbles, but soon<br />\nthey got on to it and everybody was in the<br />\nswing, perspiring and grinning together.<br />\nA few of the professors' wives were there to<br />\nchaperon and lend dignity to the occasion.<br />\nThe students owe to these ladies a debt of<br />\nthanks for their unfailing support of the dances.<br />\nAll in all, it was a great success, and credit<br />\nis due to the Cotillon Club for the care taken.<br />\nMay the next dance on April 24th be as good<br />\nas the last one.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs are at last taking on<br />\ndefinite shape and beginning the season's<br />\nround of concerts. On the twenty-second of<br />\nJanuary a very successful concert was given at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Medical School. A large<br />\nproportion of the clubs turned out. The Glee<br />\nClub, under the able leadership of Mr. Ruth,<br />\nreminded one of the palmy days of old when<br />\nthd clubs were in such a flourishing condition.<br />\nIt is with pleasure that we can note that once<br />\nmore they seem to arouse the same enthusiasm<br />\namong the students and are in such excellent<br />\nshape.<br />\nOn the twenty-sixth of February a concert<br />\nwill be given at St. David's Church, at Roland<br />\nPark, and two others will be given in the near<br />\nfuture, one at the Sparrow's Point Club and<br />\nthe other at the Sheppard-Enoch Pratt Hospital. The dates for these, however, have not<br />\nyet been decided upon.<br />\nThen, on the thirteenth of March comes<br />\ntheir red-letter day. A joint concert with the<br />\nWoman's College will be held at McCoy Hall.<br />\nThis will be the first large concert held in<br />\nBaltimore by the Musical Clubs for some time,<br />\nand everybody in the University should be<br />\nthere, and bring someone with them, too.<br />\nThis should be a great success, and the<br />\nstudents should support it.<br />\n<br />\nHULLABALOO, 1909.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nINTER-CLASS DEBATE.<br />\nMost of the men for the Senior and Junior<br />\nDebating Teams have been chosen by Dr.<br />\nFrench.

In 1877 Tennyson, Browning,<br />\nArnold, Swinburne, Rossetti and Morris were<br />\nall alive and all writing. Today but one of<br />\nthis illustrious group is alive and he has<br />\npassed the alloted time of life.<br />\nIn glancing over the literary field today, we<br />\nfind that no one man can lay claim to<br />\nabsolute pre-eminence. There is, with the<br />\nexception of Swinburne, (of whose work by<br />\nthe way I do not intend to treat in this series)<br />\nno great poet living; that is, great as Keats or<br />\nas Tennyson was great; but there are several<br />\npoets of recognized worth and ability. Of<br />\nthese most are among the last survivors of<br />\nthe Age of Tennyson, \"the Victorian Age\"<br />\nand two are of the new era which is slowly<br />\nand uncertainly beginning to shape itself<br />\ntoday.<br />\nOf the Victorian Poets Mr. Austin Dobson<br />\nis the best known, and is most conspiciously<br />\nidentified with the past. Mr. William Watson's greatest work\u2014his elegies, his epigrams,<br />\nand such poems as a \"A Child's Hair\"\u2014<br />\nwere written long ago. Mr. Alfred Austin,<br />\nwriter of charming prose and infinitely less<br />\npleasing verse, is associated with the literary<br />\nsquabbles of the '70's. Mr. Meredith has<br />\nbeen so long considered as the greatest living<br />\nnovelist that the far-off days when he wrote<br />\n\"Love in a Valley\" and \"Modern Love\"<br />\nseem to belong to. another existance. His<br />\ntransformation is indeed marvellous. It is<br />\nhard to believe that the author of \"Diana of<br />\nthe Crossways\" could have written \"The<br />\nShaving of Shagpot;\" it is equally difficult to<br />\nreconcile the facts that \"Love in a Valley,\"<br />\nand \"The Egoist\" are from the same pen.<br />\nBut this is a digression, and we must continue<br />\nour enumeration. In 1900 Rudyard Kipling<br />\nwas unquestionably the presiding genius of<br />\n<br />\nEnglish letters. The novelty of his manner<br />\nas of his matter gave him that eminence. But,<br />\nin the words of a writer at the time, he was<br />\n\"the genius of the moment\" and is so no<br />\nlonger. Mr. Andrew Lang, perhaps the<br />\nmost versatile of modern authors, has for long<br />\nlaid aside his poetic pen, but the work of such<br />\na true poet cannot die and the author of<br />\n\"Helen of Troy,\" 'Andromache,\"and\u2014more<br />\nthan all\u2014of the lovely lyric \"Who wins his<br />\nlove,\" is indeed \"a living part of English<br />\nSong.\"<br />\nAll these men are writers who have made<br />\ntheir reputations in the past, some, as Mr.<br />\nMeredith, half a century ago, though perhaps like him only now receiving that<br />\nrecognition which their own generation fail<br />\nto bestow upon them. But beside them,<br />\nthere is one poet today, in whom we can<br />\nclearly see traces of lineal descent from Keats<br />\nand from Tennyson\u2014who is the fulfillment<br />\nof the wish expressed long since that a poet<br />\nwould arise combining in his genius the<br />\ntongue of Tennyson and a dramatic instinct<br />\nwhich the author of \"Becket\" had not.<br />\nFinally, and perhaps far from least among<br />\nthese writers, is Mr. Alfred Noyes, of whom<br />\ngreat things are promised. He is as yet very<br />\nyoung, but his youth doth promise much,<br />\nand the author of \"A Night at St. Helena\"<br />\nand \"The Barrel Organ\" may live to be a<br />\nshining and abiding light among the stars of<br />\nEnglish poetry.<br />\n<br />\nProfessor\u2014\"Sound travels much faster in<br />\nwood than in air.

The only scratch<br />\nman in the event, he passed an opponent or<br />\ntwo every lap, and finally finished in a position a disinterested spectator would have<br />\ncalled second. The judges, however, gave<br />\nthe place to a man that had surely been<br />\nlapped, and Breyer had to be content with a<br />\nbronze medal.<br />\nBaily got a second place in the 50-yard<br />\ndash, open.

In spite of divers opinions the<br />\nmajority of readers have agreed that Mr. Meredith's<br />\nfirst great novel \"The Ordeal of Richard Feverel\"<br />\nstill remains his masterpiece. The following short<br />\nessay on that novel will therefore be appropriate at<br />\nthis time. The author has a thorough acquaintance<br />\nwith the works of the novelists of the Victorian<br />\nperiod and his estimate of the greatest novel of the<br />\ngreatest living English writer will, we feel sure,<br />\nprove of interest to many readers.\u2014En.]<br />\n<br />\nRICHARD FRVERAL.<br />\nRichard Feverel is generally considered Mr.<br />\nMeredith's masterpiece. He has taken a story,<br />\nterrible in itself, and he has made it more<br />\nterrible by his fearless way of handling it.<br />\nThe plot is rather complicated, but the main<br />\npoints are these: Richard, the son of Sir<br />\nAustin Peveral, runs away and marries without his father's consent. It is a love match,<br />\npure and simple. Sir Austin refuses to see<br />\nhis new daughter, but from a sense of justice,<br />\ngives his son an income sufficient to support<br />\nher properly. After the honeymoon, Richard<br />\nconies to London,leaving his wife. In London<br />\nhe meets a woman\u2014`'an enchantress\"\u2014Bella,<br />\nher name is, and proves unfaithful to his wife.<br />\nAfterwards, overtaken by a wild storm of<br />\nremorse, he does not feel worthy to return to<br />\nhis wife, whom he still loves, so he travels on<br />\nthe continent. Finally, hearing that a former<br />\nfriend, Lord Mountfalcon, has been paying<br />\ndoubtful attentions to his wife, he returns to<br />\nEngland. Meanwhile, Lucy, his wife, has<br />\nmet Sir Austin and been reconciled with him<br />\nand is living at Raynham Abbey, the home of<br />\nthe Feverels. Now Richard returns to England and goes to Raynham, where, after long<br />\nyears, he sees his wife and child. The reconciliation is complete, but not so Richard's<br />\nordeal. He must leave his wife in this<br />\nsupreme hour and meet Lord Mountfalcon.<br />\nHe tears himself away from his wife and goes<br />\nto France. Here he fights Lord Mountfalcon<br />\nand is seriously wounded. His wife and<br />\nfather hear where he is and come to him. But<br />\nthe long strain has been too much for Lucy;<br />\nshe cannot stand the hours of watching and<br />\nanxiety. She succumbs to brain fever just as<br />\nRichard recovers. She dies and Richard lives.<br />\nThe tragedy is complete.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nThe plot is complete and perfect. There are<br />\nno dangling or lost threads. With the death<br />\nof Lucy we lose all interest\u2014the book is<br />\nfinished. Mr. Meredith does not commit the<br />\nmistake of Thackeray in the Newcomer\u2014of<br />\nadding several chapters to a novel already<br />\ncompleted. To some people the plot appears<br />\nunnatural, but these are the people who are<br />\nunable to appreciate and understand the<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nAll the characters, with the possible exception of Sir Austin, are real, are people all of<br />\nus have met. That Sir Austin, with his<br />\nScientific Theory, Aphorisms, System and the<br />\nrest, could exist, seems to me impossible.<br />\nThat a real man, with human feeling, could<br />\nlook at that last supreme tragedy and turn<br />\naway complaining that his grandson is fed by<br />\na bottle, is beyond the bounds of human<br />\nimagination. To Sir Austin life was but a<br />\ncomplex system, of which he and his were<br />\nmere passive members, but with their duty to<br />\ntheir race to fulfil. This was his goal in life.<br />\nRichard's wife was dead. His son was the<br />\nfuture lord of Raynham Abbey, and to him<br />\nall must be sacrificed. The story is called a<br />\nHistory of a Father and Son, and the father,<br />\nin order that the story may exist, is made<br />\nunnatural.<br />\nRichard is the most misjudged character in<br />\nthe book. Some people cannot understand<br />\nwhy he refused to return to his wife. Two<br />\nreasons could have prompted his course of<br />\naction: One, the fact that .for purely selfish<br />\nreasons he did not wish to go back to her, he<br />\nwas tired of her. The second is the true<br />\nreason, the reason expressed in those immortal lines, \"May God give me the purity to<br />\nbe worthy of the good in her, and give her the<br />\npatience to find , out the good in me.\"<br />\nRichard was governed by a high sense of<br />\nhonor. For a moment Bella had swept him<br />\noff his feet, but his better nature was bound<br />\nto assert itself. When Richard came to his<br />\nsenses he was conscious of being unworthy to<br />\nreturn to his wife. He felt that he had sinned<br />\nand must pay the price of his sin. He must<br />\npass through his ordeal. He goes a7way.<br />\nTormented by a guilty conscience he travels,<br />\nbut always he feels compelled and forced on<br />\nby a high sense of honor. Hearing of Lord<br />\nMountfalcon's attention to his wife, he returns<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nto England. Then comes the crucial test and<br />\nRichard comes out triumphant. His life's<br />\nhappiness may be wrecked, but, having sinned<br />\nonce, and expiated his sin, he will hereafter<br />\nstand clear in his own mind. He goes to<br />\nFrance and the rest ensues.<br />\nThe other characters of the book are less<br />\nimportant, but none the less powerful. Adrian<br />\nis a magnificent portrait of a type well known<br />\nin society. He is not confined to England;<br />\nwherever there is a refined and polished state<br />\nof society, there are Adrians.<br />\nLucy is womanly, intensely womanly. She<br />\ncan give up her all to a man and then, when<br />\ndeserted, can pardon and condone his faults.<br />\nLady Blandish and Mrs. Berry form a queer<br />\nantithesis. Both are people met with in everyday life. Lady Blandish seems to be a character created by Mr. Meredith to lend him<br />\nsupport when he finds his story lagging or his<br />\ncharacters grown weak.<br />\nBut one of the strongest and truest characters in the entire book is Clare. Her story is<br />\ntrue, terribly and sweetly true. Married to a<br />\nman whom she does not love, she must keep a<br />\nbrave face to the world till the long-wished-for<br />\npeace comes to her. Dickens may appeal to<br />\nthe emotions of many by the careful and wellcalculated phrases of Old Curiosty Shop;<br />\nThackeray may move many hearts by the<br />\ndeath of Colonel Newcome; Charles Read may<br />\nbring tears to many eyes by that story of a<br />\nlife full of sorrow and suffering, and yet inspired by a divine hope\u2014The Cloister and<br />\nthe Hearth\u2014the true story of a great man.<br />\nYet to me none of these have the same depth<br />\nof feeling and pathos expressed in that one<br />\nchapter\u2014'Clare's Dairy. Mr. Meredith handles<br />\na simple fact in a simple manner. It is so<br />\nsimple, it is true, so true, that to read it<br />\nbrings tears.<br />\nThe Ordeal of Richard Feverel is not one<br />\ntragedy but a series of them. Everything is<br />\nthe natural consequence of what has gone before it. The characters are driven on as by<br />\nNemesis. The \"System\" could have but one<br />\n\u2022 result.<br />\nFrom the first that was apparent. Mr.<br />\nMeredith appreciated this when, after the<br />\nmarriage, Adrian says,\" \"So die the System!<br />\nAnd now let the prophets roar! He dies<br />\nrespectably in a marriage bed, which is more<br />\n<br />\nthan I should have told of the monster.\"<br />\nMean-time, he gave the cake a dramatic tap,<br />\n'I'll go sow nightmares.\" After Iliad read the<br />\nfirst dozen chapters I realized that some great<br />\ntragedy was inevitable. It is a book of suffering. Even Sir Austin suffered in silence.<br />\nThe book is remarkably strong in its hold<br />\nupon the reader. A lady once told me that<br />\nshe first read it when crossing the Atlantic.<br />\nWhen she finished the last chapter sbe took<br />\nthe bobk, and in sheer anger threw it far out<br />\ninto the ocean. The genuine power of the<br />\nbook is well shown by this incident. No book,<br />\nunless its power were real, and were accomplished with real people in a real plot, could<br />\nproduce such an effect.<br />\nThe tragedy in Richard Eererel is not in<br />\nLucy's dying, it is in Richard's living.<br />\n\"Have you ever noticed the expression in the<br />\neyes of blind men? That is just how Richard<br />\nlooks, as he lies there silent in his bed\u2014striving to image her on his brain.\" There is<br />\nthe real tragedy in the book.<br />\nThe place of Richard Feverel in English<br />\nLiterature is hard to define. That it is<br />\nliterature and of the highest type, there is no<br />\ndoubt. Many consider The Egoist by Mr.<br />\nMeredith the superior of Richard Feverel, but<br />\nI do not feel that the two books are to be<br />\ncompared. I consider Richard Feverel the<br />\nmasterpiece of Mr. Meredith and one of the<br />\ngreatest novels in the entire language.<br />\nMr. Meredith's style is naturally abstruse<br />\nand difficult to read, but he is at his best.<br />\nWhen I finished The Egoist, I felt that I had<br />\naccomplished quite a task, but when I finished<br />\nRichard Feverel my first thought was to read<br />\nit over again. The style here is superior to<br />\nthat of any of Mr. Meredith's other novels,<br />\nwith the possible exception of Diana of the<br />\nCross-ways.<br />\nNo praise can be too high for the merit of<br />\nthe novel. The faults are not easily perceived.<br />\nThe narrative is very slow in progressing. It<br />\nis practically half through before the real<br />\nstory commences. But this space is not wasted.<br />\nWe are prepared for the tragedy to come; yet<br />\nwhen it does come, we are stunned by its<br />\ntruth.<br />\nSW.<br />\nOur advertisers will please note editorial on<br />\npage three.<br />\nC. & P., St. Paul 256 256<br />\n<br />\nMd., Courtland 1156.1157<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore Coupe Company<br />\nCOUPES, LANDAUS, VICTORIAS<br />\nOPEN COACHES,PHAETONS, BUSSES<br />\n<br />\nMain Office, - - 315 West Fayette Street<br />\n<br />\n\f11<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nFOR LUNCH<br />\n<br />\n\"The Men's Store.\"<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLER NOTHEM<br />\n<br />\nGO TO<br />\n<br />\nTHE MADISON, Cor.

ROFESSOR<br /><br />\nJACKSON'S lectures on Persian Poetry, delivered on<br />\nthe Turnbull Foundation, are over. It is a remarkable tribute to a<br />\nman's powers as a lecturer when we consider how closely and personally Professor Jackson brought home to us the lives and work of<br />\nthe poets of far-away Siram. A possibly more remarkable tribute was<br />\npaid to the memory of Omar. Last Wednesday week, in the midst<br />\nof a driving snow-storm a throng which crowded McCoy Hall to the<br />\ndoors came to hear the lecture on Omar and his predecessors. It is<br />\nperhaps worht mentioning that at least two members of English<br />\nVA.-- :..' *4sile\u2022<br />\nLiterature I, thought last week that Chaucer's reference to \"Omer\"<br />\nreferred not to the greatest Grecian Poet, but to the best-known poet of Persia!<br />\nThe course was interesting; at times fascinating.

The<br />\nletter comes from a number of Alumni interested in the welfare of<br />\nthe University and in the maintenance of her interest in athletics.<br />\nTheir offer is a kind and generous one, and it is to be hoped it will<br />\nbe met with in the spirit it deserves.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nHE Johns Hopkins Cotillon Dance, held two weeks ago, while very<br />\nenjoyable, was marred by one thing for which there was really no<br />\nexcuse. The state of the floor was, dreadful,\u2014not that it was not<br />\nsmooth enough,\u2014but both in the hall itself and in the corridor there<br />\nwas a great deal of dust and dirt. Fortunate was the girl who had<br />\nno train! Then, too, why should the dances begin before nine?<br />\nThey never do begin at eight-thirty, as scheduled. Most people will<br />\nnot come so early, and the first half hour must be decidedly dreary<br />\nfor those who do happen to come on time. Still, in spite of these<br />\nobjections, the dance was decidedly a success.<br /><br />\nAn issue of the NEws-LETTER should have appeared last Friday, but Editors, like other<br />\nmortals, are liable to fail, particularly when the Dean's and other essays are on our hands.<br />\n.We regret the unavoidable delay, which we trust will not occur again, this year at any rate.<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., January 27, 1908.<br />\nThe Editor of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University:<br />\nMY DEAR SIR :\u2014In order to enable the track sports at the University to maintain their<br />\nposition with the other spring sport, Lacrosse, and bring forth candidates who will by their<br />\nwork in the different sets of gatnes held at times during the winter and spring months, we<br />\nhave this proposition to make to the under-classmen: That a relay race between teams selected<br />\nfrom the Junior and Freshman Classes be run at the set of games to be held by the 'Varsity<br />\nTrack Team on February 29th, 1908, for which we offer medals to the winning team.<br />\nThis is done so that more enthusiasm may be brought forth in favor of track sports,<br />\nand aid the coach and captain in getting out candidates for the track squad from the underclasses.<br />\nThe conditions upon which we make the above offer, are as follows:<br />\n(1). That the candidates for each of said teams shall become candidates of the 'Varsity<br />\nTrack Squad, and shall train regularly under the direction of the 'Varsity coach and captain.<br />\n(2). That the teams shall be picked by the track coach and 'Varsity captain, and in so<br />\ndoing they shall have just as much reference to the candidates' attendance at practice and<br />\nfaithfulness at training as the running ability.<br />\n(3). That each team shall be composed of four men.<br />\n(4). That the distance of said race shall be one mile.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nR. CURZON HOFFMAN, JR.,<br />\nW. CORNWELL SMITH,ARTHUR R.

The day which will always remain<br />\nin my memory as the never-to-be-forgotten,<br />\nfun-giving day is that on which \"My Visitor,\"<br />\nas my father calls him, came.<br />\nIn the early morning and forenoon I worked<br />\nin the fields, hay-making, and in return for<br />\nmy morning's labor I was promised the use of<br />\nour excellent riding horse for that evening.<br />\nIn the afternoon I noticed my horse had lost<br />\na shoe, so I took him down to the village to<br />\nbe shod. While waiting at the blacksmithshop, I was called over to the country store<br />\nto get a 'phone .message. This message was<br />\nrather strange; \"Tell Mr. Mun a y that<br />\nSo-and-so will be up on the evening train,\"<br />\nthe clerk said that he did not catch the name.<br />\nAfter attending to some errands in the<br />\nvillage, I rode out to my home and delivered<br />\nthe message. No one in the family had given<br />\nany one out of the vicinity an invitation and<br />\nno one knew who was coming and we all were<br />\nmore or less amused at the curtness of such a.<br />\nmessage. Much to my sorrow I was informed<br />\nthat they would need the horse promised me,<br />\nsince he was what we termed the \"station<br />\nwagon horse,\" to take the large dayton to the<br />\nstation and bring back the visitors. No one<br />\nknew whether there really was anyone coming<br />\nor someone was one playing a joke on us so<br />\nwe prepared for three people. The spare<br />\nrooms were all ready, supper on the table for<br />\nthe guests, or rather, unexpected visitors, and<br />\neverything was prepared for their arrival.<br />\nAbout time for the train to come in the<br />\nman drove down with my horse and the<br />\nstation wagon. When the train came in he<br />\nlooked around for our visitors but none came<br />\nand he was just about to drive off when the<br />\nfreight agent called out. Here's your party.<br />\nOf course, the whole family was anxious to<br />\nknow who was coming and all were out<br />\nwatching for their arrival. I, being a little<br />\nmore anxious and put out than the rest, was<br />\nthe first to find out that no one was on the<br />\nfront seat of the wagon but the driver. I ran<br />\nout to the front and asked who it was and he<br />\nsaid, \"They are in the back.\" I looked and<br />\nsaw only a crate and asked him \"Where?\"<br /><br />\n\"There,\" said he, pointing to the box I took<br />\nit out and in doing so my hand slipped in a<br />\ncrack and touched a fuzzy, hairy something<br />\nwhich gave a low whine. Then it dawned<br />\nupon me what it was. It was a through-bred<br />\nSt. Bernard puppy promised me by a friend<br />\nsometime before. While very much put out<br />\nand provoked, the whole family at once saw<br />\nthe funny side of the affair and my mother<br />\nsaid, \"My best bed linen all put out on the<br />\nbeds for a dog.\"<br />\nI however, was not disappointed, for after<br />\nI had made my dog comfortable I went and<br />\ngot my horse and had a long, beautiful, and<br />\nnever-to-be-forgotten horseback ride.\u2014M.<br /><br />\nTHE DANCE.<br />\nThe second dance of the Cotillon Club was<br />\nheld on Friday, the thirty-first of January.<br />\nFrom the point of view of the students, it was<br />\none of the most successful ever given. Everybody was there, and \"everybody was happy.\"<br />\nOld and distinguished Alumni danced<br />\naround and bumped into green young Freshmen and then the Freshmen, not to be outdone,<br />\nbumped into them. A few professors were<br />\nthere, and great excitement was aroused when<br />\na foolish Junior broke up one of them. Suppressed whispers were heard in the hall, and<br />\nthe young lady who was broken up remarked<br />\nin a wise tone:<br />\n\"I'll bet you flunk your next French<br />\nexam.\"<br />\nOf course, we can't say just who the professor was, but that night he wore his usual<br />\ncheery smile.<br />\nAnd then there was the barn dance. Some<br />\nknew it and some didn't, but everybody danced<br />\nit. A few beginners got tumbles, but soon<br />\nthey got on to it and everybody was in the<br />\nswing, perspiring and grinning together.<br />\nA few of the professors' wives were there to<br />\nchaperon and lend dignity to the occasion.<br />\nThe students owe to these ladies a debt of<br />\nthanks for their unfailing support of the dances.<br />\nAll in all, it was a great success, and credit<br />\nis due to the Cotillon Club for the care taken.<br />\nMay the next dance on April 24th be as good<br />\nas the last one.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs are at last taking on<br />\ndefinite shape and beginning the season's<br />\nround of concerts.

In 1877 Tennyson, Browning,<br />\nArnold, Swinburne, Rossetti and Morris were<br />\nall alive and all writing. Today but one of<br />\nthis illustrious group is alive and he has<br />\npassed the alloted time of life.<br />\nIn glancing over the literary field today, we<br />\nfind that no one man can lay claim to<br />\nabsolute pre-eminence. There is, with the<br />\nexception of Swinburne, (of whose work by<br />\nthe way I do not intend to treat in this series)<br />\nno great poet living; that is, great as Keats or<br />\nas Tennyson was great; but there are several<br />\npoets of recognized worth and ability. Of<br />\nthese most are among the last survivors of<br />\nthe Age of Tennyson, \"the Victorian Age\"<br />\nand two are of the new era which is slowly<br />\nand uncertainly beginning to shape itself<br />\ntoday.<br />\nOf the Victorian Poets Mr. Austin Dobson<br />\nis the best known, and is most conspiciously<br />\nidentified with the past. Mr. William Watson's greatest work\u2014his elegies, his epigrams,<br />\nand such poems as a \"A Child's Hair\"\u2014<br />\nwere written long ago. Mr. Alfred Austin,<br />\nwriter of charming prose and infinitely less<br />\npleasing verse, is associated with the literary<br />\nsquabbles of the '70's. Mr. Meredith has<br />\nbeen so long considered as the greatest living<br />\nnovelist that the far-off days when he wrote<br />\n\"Love in a Valley\" and \"Modern Love\"<br />\nseem to belong to. another existance. His<br />\ntransformation is indeed marvellous. It is<br />\nhard to believe that the author of \"Diana of<br />\nthe Crossways\" could have written \"The<br />\nShaving of Shagpot;\" it is equally difficult to<br />\nreconcile the facts that \"Love in a Valley,\"<br />\nand \"The Egoist\" are from the same pen.<br />\nBut this is a digression, and we must continue<br />\nour enumeration. In 1900 Rudyard Kipling<br />\nwas unquestionably the presiding genius of<br /><br />\nEnglish letters. The novelty of his manner<br />\nas of his matter gave him that eminence. But,<br />\nin the words of a writer at the time, he was<br />\n\"the genius of the moment\" and is so no<br />\nlonger. Mr. Andrew Lang, perhaps the<br />\nmost versatile of modern authors, has for long<br />\nlaid aside his poetic pen, but the work of such<br />\na true poet cannot die and the author of<br />\n\"Helen of Troy,\" 'Andromache,\"and\u2014more<br />\nthan all\u2014of the lovely lyric \"Who wins his<br />\nlove,\" is indeed \"a living part of English<br />\nSong.\"<br />\nAll these men are writers who have made<br />\ntheir reputations in the past, some, as Mr.<br />\nMeredith, half a century ago, though perhaps like him only now receiving that<br />\nrecognition which their own generation fail<br />\nto bestow upon them. But beside them,<br />\nthere is one poet today, in whom we can<br />\nclearly see traces of lineal descent from Keats<br />\nand from Tennyson\u2014who is the fulfillment<br />\nof the wish expressed long since that a poet<br />\nwould arise combining in his genius the<br />\ntongue of Tennyson and a dramatic instinct<br />\nwhich the author of \"Becket\" had not.<br />\nFinally, and perhaps far from least among<br />\nthese writers, is Mr. Alfred Noyes, of whom<br />\ngreat things are promised. He is as yet very<br />\nyoung, but his youth doth promise much,<br />\nand the author of \"A Night at St. Helena\"<br />\nand \"The Barrel Organ\" may live to be a<br />\nshining and abiding light among the stars of<br />\nEnglish poetry.<br /><br />\nProfessor\u2014\"Sound travels much faster in<br />\nwood than in air.

The only scratch<br />\nman in the event, he passed an opponent or<br />\ntwo every lap, and finally finished in a position a disinterested spectator would have<br />\ncalled second. The judges, however, gave<br />\nthe place to a man that had surely been<br />\nlapped, and Breyer had to be content with a<br />\nbronze medal.<br />\nBaily got a second place in the 50-yard<br />\ndash, open.

In spite of divers opinions the<br />\nmajority of readers have agreed that Mr. Meredith's<br />\nfirst great novel \"The Ordeal of Richard Feverel\"<br />\nstill remains his masterpiece. The following short<br />\nessay on that novel will therefore be appropriate at<br />\nthis time. The author has a thorough acquaintance<br />\nwith the works of the novelists of the Victorian<br />\nperiod and his estimate of the greatest novel of the<br />\ngreatest living English writer will, we feel sure,<br />\nprove of interest to many readers.\u2014En.]<br /><br />\nRICHARD FRVERAL.<br />\nRichard Feverel is generally considered Mr.<br />\nMeredith's masterpiece. He has taken a story,<br />\nterrible in itself, and he has made it more<br />\nterrible by his fearless way of handling it.<br />\nThe plot is rather complicated, but the main<br />\npoints are these: Richard, the son of Sir<br />\nAustin Peveral, runs away and marries without his father's consent. It is a love match,<br />\npure and simple. Sir Austin refuses to see<br />\nhis new daughter, but from a sense of justice,<br />\ngives his son an income sufficient to support<br />\nher properly. After the honeymoon, Richard<br />\nconies to London,leaving his wife. In London<br />\nhe meets a woman\u2014`'an enchantress\"\u2014Bella,<br />\nher name is, and proves unfaithful to his wife.<br />\nAfterwards, overtaken by a wild storm of<br />\nremorse, he does not feel worthy to return to<br />\nhis wife, whom he still loves, so he travels on<br />\nthe continent. Finally, hearing that a former<br />\nfriend, Lord Mountfalcon, has been paying<br />\ndoubtful attentions to his wife, he returns to<br />\nEngland. Meanwhile, Lucy, his wife, has<br />\nmet Sir Austin and been reconciled with him<br />\nand is living at Raynham Abbey, the home of<br />\nthe Feverels. Now Richard returns to England and goes to Raynham, where, after long<br />\nyears, he sees his wife and child. The reconciliation is complete, but not so Richard's<br />\nordeal. He must leave his wife in this<br />\nsupreme hour and meet Lord Mountfalcon.<br />\nHe tears himself away from his wife and goes<br />\nto France. Here he fights Lord Mountfalcon<br />\nand is seriously wounded. His wife and<br />\nfather hear where he is and come to him. But<br />\nthe long strain has been too much for Lucy;<br />\nshe cannot stand the hours of watching and<br />\nanxiety. She succumbs to brain fever just as<br />\nRichard recovers. She dies and Richard lives.<br />\nThe tragedy is complete.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nThe plot is complete and perfect. There are<br />\nno dangling or lost threads. With the death<br />\nof Lucy we lose all interest\u2014the book is<br />\nfinished. Mr. Meredith does not commit the<br />\nmistake of Thackeray in the Newcomer\u2014of<br />\nadding several chapters to a novel already<br />\ncompleted. To some people the plot appears<br />\nunnatural, but these are the people who are<br />\nunable to appreciate and understand the<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nAll the characters, with the possible exception of Sir Austin, are real, are people all of<br />\nus have met. That Sir Austin, with his<br />\nScientific Theory, Aphorisms, System and the<br />\nrest, could exist, seems to me impossible.<br />\nThat a real man, with human feeling, could<br />\nlook at that last supreme tragedy and turn<br />\naway complaining that his grandson is fed by<br />\na bottle, is beyond the bounds of human<br />\nimagination. To Sir Austin life was but a<br />\ncomplex system, of which he and his were<br />\nmere passive members, but with their duty to<br />\ntheir race to fulfil. This was his goal in life.<br />\nRichard's wife was dead. His son was the<br />\nfuture lord of Raynham Abbey, and to him<br />\nall must be sacrificed. The story is called a<br />\nHistory of a Father and Son, and the father,<br />\nin order that the story may exist, is made<br />\nunnatural.<br />\nRichard is the most misjudged character in<br />\nthe book. Some people cannot understand<br />\nwhy he refused to return to his wife. Two<br />\nreasons could have prompted his course of<br />\naction: One, the fact that .for purely selfish<br />\nreasons he did not wish to go back to her, he<br />\nwas tired of her. The second is the true<br />\nreason, the reason expressed in those immortal lines, \"May God give me the purity to<br />\nbe worthy of the good in her, and give her the<br />\npatience to find , out the good in me.\"<br />\nRichard was governed by a high sense of<br />\nhonor. For a moment Bella had swept him<br />\noff his feet, but his better nature was bound<br />\nto assert itself. When Richard came to his<br />\nsenses he was conscious of being unworthy to<br />\nreturn to his wife. He felt that he had sinned<br />\nand must pay the price of his sin. He must<br />\npass through his ordeal. He goes a7way.<br />\nTormented by a guilty conscience he travels,<br />\nbut always he feels compelled and forced on<br />\nby a high sense of honor. Hearing of Lord<br />\nMountfalcon's attention to his wife, he returns<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nto England. Then comes the crucial test and<br />\nRichard comes out triumphant. His life's<br />\nhappiness may be wrecked, but, having sinned<br />\nonce, and expiated his sin, he will hereafter<br />\nstand clear in his own mind. He goes to<br />\nFrance and the rest ensues.<br />\nThe other characters of the book are less<br />\nimportant, but none the less powerful. Adrian<br />\nis a magnificent portrait of a type well known<br />\nin society. He is not confined to England;<br />\nwherever there is a refined and polished state<br />\nof society, there are Adrians.<br />\nLucy is womanly, intensely womanly. She<br />\ncan give up her all to a man and then, when<br />\ndeserted, can pardon and condone his faults.<br />\nLady Blandish and Mrs. Berry form a queer<br />\nantithesis. Both are people met with in everyday life. Lady Blandish seems to be a character created by Mr. Meredith to lend him<br />\nsupport when he finds his story lagging or his<br />\ncharacters grown weak.<br />\nBut one of the strongest and truest characters in the entire book is Clare. Her story is<br />\ntrue, terribly and sweetly true. Married to a<br />\nman whom she does not love, she must keep a<br />\nbrave face to the world till the long-wished-for<br />\npeace comes to her. Dickens may appeal to<br />\nthe emotions of many by the careful and wellcalculated phrases of Old Curiosty Shop;<br />\nThackeray may move many hearts by the<br />\ndeath of Colonel Newcome; Charles Read may<br />\nbring tears to many eyes by that story of a<br />\nlife full of sorrow and suffering, and yet inspired by a divine hope\u2014The Cloister and<br />\nthe Hearth\u2014the true story of a great man.<br />\nYet to me none of these have the same depth<br />\nof feeling and pathos expressed in that one<br />\nchapter\u2014'Clare's Dairy. Mr. Meredith handles<br />\na simple fact in a simple manner. It is so<br />\nsimple, it is true, so true, that to read it<br />\nbrings tears.<br />\nThe Ordeal of Richard Feverel is not one<br />\ntragedy but a series of them. Everything is<br />\nthe natural consequence of what has gone before it. The characters are driven on as by<br />\nNemesis. The \"System\" could have but one<br />\n\u2022 result.<br />\nFrom the first that was apparent. Mr.<br />\nMeredith appreciated this when, after the<br />\nmarriage, Adrian says,\" \"So die the System!<br />\nAnd now let the prophets roar! He dies<br />\nrespectably in a marriage bed, which is more<br /><br />\nthan I should have told of the monster.\"<br />\nMean-time, he gave the cake a dramatic tap,<br />\n'I'll go sow nightmares.\" After Iliad read the<br />\nfirst dozen chapters I realized that some great<br />\ntragedy was inevitable. It is a book of suffering. Even Sir Austin suffered in silence.<br />\nThe book is remarkably strong in its hold<br />\nupon the reader. A lady once told me that<br />\nshe first read it when crossing the Atlantic.<br />\nWhen she finished the last chapter sbe took<br />\nthe bobk, and in sheer anger threw it far out<br />\ninto the ocean. The genuine power of the<br />\nbook is well shown by this incident. No book,<br />\nunless its power were real, and were accomplished with real people in a real plot, could<br />\nproduce such an effect.<br />\nThe tragedy in Richard Eererel is not in<br />\nLucy's dying, it is in Richard's living.<br />\n\"Have you ever noticed the expression in the<br />\neyes of blind men? That is just how Richard<br />\nlooks, as he lies there silent in his bed\u2014striving to image her on his brain.\" There is<br />\nthe real tragedy in the book.<br />\nThe place of Richard Feverel in English<br />\nLiterature is hard to define. That it is<br />\nliterature and of the highest type, there is no<br />\ndoubt. Many consider The Egoist by Mr.<br />\nMeredith the superior of Richard Feverel, but<br />\nI do not feel that the two books are to be<br />\ncompared. I consider Richard Feverel the<br />\nmasterpiece of Mr. Meredith and one of the<br />\ngreatest novels in the entire language.<br />\nMr. Meredith's style is naturally abstruse<br />\nand difficult to read, but he is at his best.<br />\nWhen I finished The Egoist, I felt that I had<br />\naccomplished quite a task, but when I finished<br />\nRichard Feverel my first thought was to read<br />\nit over again. The style here is superior to<br />\nthat of any of Mr. Meredith's other novels,<br />\nwith the possible exception of Diana of the<br />\nCross-ways.<br />\nNo praise can be too high for the merit of<br />\nthe novel. The faults are not easily perceived.<br />\nThe narrative is very slow in progressing. It<br />\nis practically half through before the real<br />\nstory commences. But this space is not wasted.<br />\nWe are prepared for the tragedy to come; yet<br />\nwhen it does come, we are stunned by its<br />\ntruth.<br />\nSW.<br />\nOur advertisers will please note editorial on<br />\npage three.<br />\nC. &amp; P., St. Paul 256 256<br /><br />\nMd., Courtland 1156.1157<br /><br />\nBaltimore Coupe Company<br />\nCOUPES, LANDAUS, VICTORIAS<br />\nOPEN COACHES,PHAETONS, BUSSES<br /><br />\nMain Office, - - 315 West Fayette Street<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nFOR LUNCH<br /><br />\n\"The Men's Store.\"<br /><br />\nHUTZLER NOTHEM<br /><br />\nGO TO<br /><br />\nTHE MADISON, Cor.
