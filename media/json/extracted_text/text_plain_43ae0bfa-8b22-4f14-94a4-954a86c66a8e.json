With this action<br />\nstaring them in the face, the faculty was forced to capitulate on the<br />\nfollowing day by reinstating the<br />\nsuspended students and by granting<br />\nattendance to the strikers for all<br />\nclasses missed during their selfimposed holiday.<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nLack of enforcement of freshman<br />\nregulations at Boston Tech is being<br />\nconsidered seriously by the undergraduates.
