President<br />\nLincoln Gordon removed him<br />\nfor refusal to allow Gordon to<br />\nedit the May, 1970 issue of the<br />\npaper.

Our editorial, in what was meant as a<br />\nsomewhat tongue-in-cheek reference to a series of articles<br />\nrun in the News-Letter last year about government<br />\nfunding, put too much of the blame for the situation on an<br />\nadministrative assistant, who drew up a report similar to<br />\nthe one called for by the Board of Trustees, and seemingly<br />\nwas more or less an innocent bystander in an<br />\nadministration mess. We would like to apologize to him<br />\nand to anyone else who may have been offended by the<br />\nlanguage used in our editorial.<br />\nWe do, however, find it somewhat odd that Dr. Muller<br />\nshould rush so quickly to the defense of this report, since<br />\nit was his statements that led us to believe that it was less<br />\nthan adequate. We also would like to point out that Dr.<br />\nMuller gets his feathers ruffled fairly easily when a member<br />\nof the administration is involved, but isn't quite as upset<br />\nwhen it's the undergraduate at the receiving end. Perhaps<br />\nthe provost could say he's sorry that we have to cat plastic<br />\nfood at Levering while he's dining in the Faculty Club. Or<br />\nmaybe he could express his regrets that no substantive<br />\naction has been taken to dramatically increase the number<br />\nof undergraduate course offerings. Or perhaps the school's<br />\nnumber two man could apologize for the slap in the face<br />\nhe gave the students when he told them that there are no<br />\nplans to pursue the investigation of Hopkins dependence<br />\non the government. Okay, we've done our apologizing Dr.<br />\nMuller,. now it's time for you to do yours.<br />\n<br />\nSC abdication<br />\nThe Student Council has backed away from action to<br />\nimprove the Levering food service by rejecting a boycott<br />\nproposal. The reasoning of the bold SC members was that<br />\nif the boycott was successful there would be no food<br />\nservice at all. The council, which annually attempts to<br />\ndissolve itself because it has no power, should not wonder<br />\nat its own weakness when it so clearly abdicates a<br />\nleadership role in improving campus life. There is both a<br />\nneed for a boycott and alternative food services, including<br />\nan open Faculty Club, and the Student Council has failed<br />\nto press for either. By doing so, the council has<br />\nundermined any effectiveness the committee to suggest<br />\nchanges to Macke Company might have had. That<br />\ncommittee, incidentally, is under Student Council<br />\nPresident Gerald Bates, and if his aggressiveness is reflected<br />\nin the SC boycott rejection, then we can resign ourselves<br />\nto stale, unhealthy food for the rest of the year.<br />\nAt the present time, there is not a strong, organized<br />\nboycott. Instead, there is a listless, half-hearted one<br />\nstemming more from the sickening nature of the cafeteria<br />\nthan from anyone's conscious effort. Equally evident is the<br />\nlack of pressure to make the facilities of the Faculty Club<br />\navailable to all members of the Hopkins community. The<br />\nresult of this passive acceptance of an intolerable situation<br />\nis that Levering Hall has been killed as the only social<br />\ncenter on campus and students are surviving on<br />\nHarleyburgers. Student leaders, including those on the<br />\nStudent Council, must take the initiative to bring decent<br />\nfood to undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\nSept. 24, 1971<br />\n<br />\n\"That Next Appointment Better Be Good\"<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour allegations in the<br />\nNews-Letter of September 21<br />\nconcerning the work of Mr.<br />\nWayne Anderson are without<br />\nfoundation in fact.

This hypocritical stance is in direct<br />\nconflict with your moral principles.<br />\nThe News\u2014Letter made the statement that<br />\n\"The hostility to the military is among the most<br />\nwelcome changes \"as values of recent years.\" To<br />\nparaphrase the great American philosopher,<br />\nSantayana, those who failed to learn history are<br />\ncondemned to repeat it. Need I remind you that<br />\nthe pacifist sentiments of Britain, France and the<br />\nUnited States during the 1930's permitted the<br />\nrise of such lovables as Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo,<br />\nFranco, Salazar, Chiang Kai-Slick and others?<br />\nNeed I remind you that WW 11 was fought to<br />\ncomplete WW I, which was caused not by<br />\nmilitarism but by the mistakes of politicians?<br />\nNeed I remind you that the U.

If you consider the U. S.Army<br />\nto be a deep-rooted institution, look at some<br />\nother nations and then think again. Most<br />\ncountries do not even allow its youth the liberty<br />\nof a draft, or choice of branch of service, or the<br />\ncomparative comforts of our army. Conscription<br />\nis mandatory almost worldwide, and their armies<br />\ndo not enjoy half the privileges that ours does.<br />\nOurs is not a deep-rooted army, for there are<br />\nrelatively few career officers and professional<br />\nsoldiers.<br />\nOver 40% of our officers corps are ROTC<br />\ngraduates, men who have had college educations,<br />\nand at a civilian college such as Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThese are well-educated civilians serving a couple<br />\nof years as an officer, and getting invaluable<br />\nexperience as an executive in their early twenties.<br />\nRead what business executives have to say about<br />\nhiring ROTC grads. A copy of their statements is<br />\navailable in the ROTC building, a building that<br />\nyou might want to visit sometime to learn a little<br />\nabout ROTC. The result of ROTC- our officer<br />\ncorps is a civilian corps. No need to worry about<br />\na junta here.<br />\nYou mention that the army is destructive.<br />\nWould you say that on the graves of William<br />\nGorgas and Walter Reed, the men who found the<br />\ncures for malaria and yellow fever, respectively?<br />\nWould you say that to the survivors of Auschwitz<br />\nand Buchenwald, people who not be survivors if<br />\nthe Army did not arrive in time%<br />\nThis is not a perfect world; an army is needed<br />\nto do the dirty work of fighting and dying so<br />\nthat you and others may have the right to say<br />\nand do what they want to do. Come over to the<br />\nROTC building and talk to Col. Parmly and his<br />\nstaff, or to some of the cadets. Read a little on<br />\nROTC, and see what it is about.

In his way stood Father<br />\nGrandier, a priest who all but<br />\nruled the city \u2014 in a very<br />\npriestly sort of way, of course.<br />\nAlthough a powerful and<br />\nrespected man of the cloth, he is<br />\nalso a great despoiler of young<br />\n<br />\nmaidens. One of these he falls in<br />\nlove with and marries.<br />\nDriven<br />\nSister Jeanne, a hunchbacked<br />\nnun who has long been in love<br />\nwith Grandier from afar is driven<br />\nby her jealousy and madness to<br />\nmake accusations to the effect<br />\nthat Grandier is possessed by the<br />\ndevil and that he has corrupted<br />\nher and the sisters of her order<br />\nwith the devil's lust.<br />\nPlaying right into Richelieu's<br />\nhands, there follows a trial and<br />\nprolonged attempts at exorcism<br />\nby one Father Barre. He appears<br />\nto be more possessed than<br />\nanyone else. The remainder of<br />\nthe film consists of Grandier's<br />\ntrial, torture, and inevitable<br />\ndeath.<br />\nOliver Reed, a veteran of<br />\nRussell's \"Women in Love,\" is<br />\nthe one truly magnificent thing<br />\nin the film His Grandier is so<br />\nincredibly human and martyred<br />\nas to be unreal \u2014 yet he<br />\ntriumphs to the end as by far the<br />\nstrongest character.<br />\nMiraculous<br />\nVanessa Redgrave shines in<br />\nher role as the sadly demented<br />\nSister Jeanne. Several times she<br />\nlapses into fantastic imaginings<br />\nof herself and Grandier united in<br />\npassion \u2014 Grandier always being<br />\na Christ-figure, walking on<br />\n<br />\nwater, descending from the<br />\ncross, etc. to meet her. Miss<br />\nRedgrave is quite effective as the<br />\nstooped and cacklingly crazy<br />\nMother Superior.<br />\nTechnical aspects of the film<br />\nare, as always with Russell, to be<br />\nconsidered excellent. He has<br />\nreconstructed a not altogether<br />\nrealistic but a majestic and<br />\nstylistic representation of the<br />\nwalled city of Loudun.<br />\nThe devils of the film appear<br />\nto be largely in Ken Russell's<br />\nmind. He is obsessed with<br />\ndepicting the complete graphic<br />\n(and somewhat exaggerated)<br />\nreality of the events at Loudun.<br />\nThe story is based on factual<br />\ncharacters. t is taken from the<br />\nplay by John Whiting which was<br />\nin turn based on Aldous<br />\nHwdey's The Devils of Loudun<br />\n\u2014 all of which is based on fact.<br />\nGrotesque<br />\nThe problem seems to be that<br />\nRussell didn't know where to<br />\nstop with the grossness and go<br />\non about his business.

The<br />\nfollowing are excerpts of the<br />\nlengthy conversation, touching<br />\non many aspects of Hopkins'<br />\nathletics.<br />\nN-L: Mr. Turner, how long have.<br />\nyou been director of physical<br />\neducation and athletics here at<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nMT: I've been director since<br />\nabout February of 1950.<br />\nN-L: If you retired tomorrow,<br />\nwhat would you consider your<br />\nmajor accomplishment during<br />\nthese past 20 years?<br />\nMT: I guess the thing that I feel<br />\nthe most comfortable about is<br />\nthe fact that we've been able to<br />\nmaintain a pretty full program<br />\nof athletics over these twenty<br />\nyears with really a very minimal<br />\nbudget. There have been many<br />\ntimes when we've had<br />\ndifficulties in keeping a program<br />\ngoing, in maintaining a full<br />\nintercollegiate, intramural and<br />\n<br />\nphysical education program with<br />\nthe resources we've had.<br />\nFortunately, we've been able<br />\nto avoid losing any of the<br />\nprogram in all this time and I'm<br />\nhappy that we've been able to<br />\nprovide the opportunities we<br />\nhave for the many kids to play<br />\nsports and have athletic<br />\nopportunities.<br />\nN-L: Would you consider<br />\nanything to be a failure on your<br />\npart or on the part of Hopkins?<br />\nMT: I suppose -every director<br />\nfeels failure-when he's unable to<br />\nget enough money to do all the<br />\nthings he'd like to be able to do<br />\nwith his programs. In our case<br />\nthe monetary decisions have<br />\nbeen made by somebody higher<br />\nthan me; the only thing I can<br />\nfeel is that maybe I'm not as<br />\ngood a salesman as I would like<br />\nto be to get more money for the<br />\nprogram. Through the years,<br />\nthough, we've been reasonably<br />\nweel treated. Obviously I wish<br />\nwe could be better treated.<br />\nN-L: If I whipped out my wallet<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nspoRTs<br />\n<br />\nBooters Lengthen<br />\nStreak To Three<br />\nBy JEFF FORMAN<br />\nRebounding back from a<br />\ntough loss to Calvert Hall last<br />\nweek, the Hopkins' soccer team<br />\neasily defeated Baltimore<br />\nCommunity College on Saturday<br />\nby a score of six to one,<br />\nexhibiting a bit of hustle and<br />\ndetermination along the way.<br />\nTuesday, the Blue Jays<br />\noutclassed Arundel Community<br />\nCollege eight to five. Scott<br />\nTyner and Roberto Aguero each<br />\nhad a pair of goals in a game<br />\npretty much dominated by the<br />\nBlue Jays. The score at the half<br />\nstood at seven to zero, so Coach<br />\nRobert Oliver rested the first<br />\nstring during the econd half.<br />\nHopkins kept the ball in their<br />\npossession throughout most of<br />\nthe game and kept the Arundel<br />\ngoalie busy with plenty of shots<br />\nHoping to extend their streak<br />\n<br />\nto three wins, the booters took<br />\non Maryland's top-rated Morgan<br />\nState on Wednesday. In a very<br />\nphysical game the Jays<br />\noutmuscled State two to one.<br />\nThe first quarter ended scoreless<br />\nwith Hopkins looking the<br />\naggressor, although somewhat<br />\nunorganized. But in the early<br />\nminutes of the second period,<br />\nScott Tyner battled for<br />\npossession of the right wing and<br />\ncrossed beautifully to Mike<br />\nHogan who headed the ball into<br />\nthe net for the .first point. The<br />\nsecond point came on a penalty<br />\nkick awarded because Morgan<br />\nState neglected to report a goalie<br />\nchange. State retaliated with a<br />\ngoal of its own but at the final<br />\nhorn it was Hopkins on top two<br />\nto one.<br />\nTomorrow is the first regular<br />\nseason game and kick-off time is<br />\n12:00 noon.<br />\n<br />\nSports Briefs<br />\nFOOTBALL MANAGERS<br />\nThe varsity football team has<br />\na great need for managers and<br />\ntrainers. Anyone who would like<br />\nto serve in this capacity is urged<br />\nto see Coach Cox at the Athletic<br />\nCenter or on the practice field.<br />\nTheNews-Letter BIA football<br />\nteam is reported to be the<br />\nstrongest the paper has fielded in<br />\nover 75 years. When asked about<br />\nthe chances of the team, head<br />\nstrategist Alice Weaver said<br />\n\"This team is going to surprise a<br />\nlot of folks.\" The squad,<br />\nthe Paper Tigers ,is expected to<br />\nshow up for most contests.<br />\n<br />\nright now and offered the<br />\nathletic program $20,000, how<br />\nwould you spend it?<br />\nMT: They're a few pieces of<br />\nmajor equipment that I would<br />\nlike to buy: namely, one more<br />\nof those universal gyms, our's<br />\nhas been extremely well used by<br />\npeople of all ages and for so<br />\nmany purposes.<br />\nWhile our uniforms on the<br />\nwhole are in pretty good shape<br />\ndue to heavy buying two years<br />\nago, some of them, particularly<br />\nfootball and lacrosse uniforms,<br />\nare showing signs of wear and<br />\ntear. They would need to be<br />\nreplaced.<br />\nWe'd like to buy new sets of<br />\ngame sweatclothes also.<br />\nN-L:. Do you contemplate<br />\nexpansion of the athletic plant<br />\nin the near future?<br />\nMT: I think the most critical<br />\nneed probably that we have is<br />\nadditional tennis courts. Six<br />\ncourts for a student body<br />\npopulation of approximately<br />\n3500 is very little.<br />\nWe certainly are extremely<br />\ncrowded on our outdoor<br />\nfacilities in the spring when we<br />\ntry to run an intramural<br />\nprogram. Furthermore, if we<br />\nbegin to have an interest as the<br />\nnumber of women increase on<br />\nour campus, and intercollegiate<br />\nathletics for women become a<br />\npart of our program, we would<br />\nhave to cut somebody<br />\nsomewhere in order to do that.<br />\nSo our outside facilities are also<br />\nour poorest area facilities at the<br />\npresent time.<br />\nN-L: How long do you expect it<br />\nto be before there are women<br />\nparticipating on intercollegiate<br />\nteams such as basketball,<br />\nvolleyball or tennis.<br />\nMT: I have no idea, Bruce. It<br />\njust depents on who comes in as<br />\nstudents, and what their drives<br />\nand feelings toward playing<br />\nintercollegiate athletics really<br />\nare.<br />\nI know that nationally there is<br />\na trend for more and more<br />\nwomen's intercoolegiate<br />\nathletics on the same general<br />\norganizational level as men.<br />\nBut it will come only as a<br />\nconsequence of the individual<br />\ndesires of the students that we<br />\ntake. This may run to a<br />\nbasketball situation, a hockey<br />\nsituation or a synchronized<br />\nswimming situation. We'll just<br />\nhave to wait and see where the<br />\ninterests and demand are, and<br />\nwhether our facilities can<br />\nincorporate it.<br />\nN-L: How would these girls go<br />\nabout forming intercollegiate<br />\nathletic teams?<br />\n<br />\nTICKET BOOKS<br />\nTicket books for this year's<br />\nsports will be available at the<br />\nNewton H. White Athletic<br />\nCenter from 9:00AM till 4:30<br />\nPM today, and from 9:00 AM<br />\ntill 2:00 PM on Saturday.<br />\nIncidentally, tomorrow will<br />\nbe the last day on which you can<br />\npick up your ticket books.<br />\n<br />\nMT: Actually, I suppose they<br />\nwould go through the same<br />\nprocesses as men's teams do.<br />\nMost directors would not involve<br />\na major facility or a major<br />\namount of money for a group of<br />\ngirls who came in and said that<br />\nthey have enough girls for a<br />\nbasketball team. This would<br />\ninvolve making adjustments of<br />\npresent commitments, and, this<br />\nwould also involve, in terms of a<br />\nschedule, making committments<br />\nto other people. No one is<br />\ninterested in making up a<br />\n<br />\nschedule and finding that<br />\nhalfway through the season, the<br />\nteam begins to disintegrate.<br />\nIt would probably follow the<br />\nsame general pattern as boys in<br />\nthe sense that a club team would<br />\nbe started, and play whatever<br />\nkind of local competition could<br />\nbe developed. We would then see<br />\nwhether the interest is<br />\nmaintained, and if it seems that<br />\nthe team can sustain itself for a<br />\ncouple years, it finally works its<br />\nway into the regular program.<br />\nN-L: Are there a large number of<br />\nwomen using Hopkins' gym<br />\nfacilities at present?<br />\nMT: I think that the swimming<br />\npool has noticed a marked<br />\nincrease in number of girls in the<br />\nrecreational swim period.<br />\nAs far as seeing them on the<br />\ngym floor,I can't say that I have,<br />\nbut I have noticed them on the<br />\ntennis courts.<br />\nN-L: It's been about a year and a<br />\nhalf since the decision was made<br />\nto end compulsory physical<br />\neducation. How wise a move was<br />\nthis, in your estimation?<br />\nMT: I don't think that anybody<br />\ncan really tell unless we gave<br />\nfitness tests. In truth the human<br />\nbody is the probably the most<br />\nadaptible and most<br />\nindestructible piece of<br />\nmachinery the world \u2022 has ever<br />\nknown. You can abuse it very,<br />\nvery much without it ever really<br />\nbecoming apparent.<br />\nI don't think in terms of<br />\nfitness in the college student<br />\nthat it makes a great deal of<br />\ndifference whether he's taking<br />\nphysical education or not. What<br />\nI think will be a difference is 15<br />\nyears from now, when he hasn't<br />\nlearned enough games or things<br />\nto do and he begins to run down<br />\na little bit and the doctor says,<br />\n\"Man,I think you ought to start<br />\nsome excercise some way,\" and<br />\nwhat does the guy do?Suppose<br />\nhe doesn't know how to play<br />\ntennis or badminton or<br />\nsomething to give him some<br />\ncardiovascular activity? So he<br />\nends up jogging, a terrible way<br />\nto get physical activity in my<br />\nviewpoint.<br />\nSo, in the long run, this will<br />\nhurt them by not exposing them<br />\nto as many activities.<br />\nN-L: This is a two part question:<br />\nFirst of all, from your contact<br />\nwith other athletic directors,<br />\nhave a lot of schools gone<br />\ntoward eliminating compulsory<br />\nphysical education?<br />\nSecondly, do you think<br />\nHopkins will ever return to such<br />\na program?<br />\nMT: I think that two and three<br />\nyears ago, Bruce, that there was<br />\na trend to do this sort of thing. I<br />\ndon't think that anybody in the<br />\nlast year has lost physical<br />\neducation. In a few cases, there<br />\nhave been rather serious studies<br />\nof it, and a real honest attempt<br />\nwas made to evaluate the<br />\nphysical education program at<br />\ninstitutions and most of those in<br />\nthe last year have survived even<br />\non a compulsory basis.<br />\n<br />\nMarshall Turner<br />\nI think the real push is off as<br />\nfar as students forcing physical<br />\neducation out only because it's<br />\nrequired.<br />\nOne of the most interesting<br />\nthings about all of these schools<br />\nthat have been forced to drop<br />\nphysical education, almost,<br />\nwithout exception, students<br />\nwould admit that the program<br />\nwas good and they enjoyed it<br />\nwhen they were in it and the<br />\nonly objection was that it was<br />\nrequired. But obviously if it isn't<br />\nrequired it isn't going to reach<br />\nthe fellows who need it the<br />\nmost.<br />\nAs t9 the program's possible<br />\nreturn, the climate right now is<br />\nnot right. But I think that<br />\ncumulatively we will find that<br />\nkids will have less interest in<br />\nin tramurals and won't<br />\nparticipate in them unless they<br />\nhave already learned how to<br />\nparticipate in them before they<br />\ngot to college, and we may find<br />\nthat slowly the interest in<br />\nphysical activities classes will<br />\npick up. We've noticed that the<br />\n60 to 75 already active in our<br />\nclasses already have a bit of<br />\ninterest and would like to learn a<br />\nlittle more or something else...<br />\nSo, compulsory physical<br />\neducation may come, but not<br />\nimmediately.<br />\nN-L Is it still necessary to charge<br />\nfor entrance to football,<br />\nbasketball, and lacrosse games?<br />\nHow long will this procedure<br />\ncontinue?<br />\nMT I think the institution of an<br />\nadmission charge here was<br />\noccasioned by the University's<br />\nfinancial picture. Let us realize<br />\nthat the revenue so gained is not<br />\ngoing ta keep the university out<br />\nof debt, but if you'll go back a<br />\nbit, you might realize that Dr.<br />\nGordon at that time might have<br />\nbeen searching for any 5, 10, 15,<br />\nor 20 thousand dollars he could<br />\nfind in savings or income.<br />\nThe attitude toward charging,<br />\nI think, has changed since 1934<br />\nor 1937 when it was instituted<br />\nand the reasons for doing it then<br />\nwere much more vital and<br />\ncrucial to intercollegiate<br />\nathletics than they are now. In<br />\nour case, the gate receipts don't<br />\nfigure into our budget at all;<br />\nthey're just general university<br />\nmoneys... So charging admission<br />\nto selected sports events hasn't<br />\naffected our program.<br />\nI don't know whether there is<br />\nany sentiment to change this<br />\nprogram. This year, I'd like to<br />\nsay, we have reduced the<br />\nadmission charge for students<br />\nwithout tickets.<br />\nN-L Thank you, Mr. Turner.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nSept. 24, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nJay Football Squad Faces Strong Challenge<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nfootball team will face a stiff<br />\nchallenge in its 1971 opener<br />\ntomorrow afternoon when<br />\nMuhlenberg College comes to<br />\ntown for a 2:00 game at<br />\nHomewood Field. The Mules,<br />\n16-6 winners over Hopkins last<br />\nyear and runners-up along with<br />\nthe Blue Jays for the MAC<br />\nSouthern Division crown, will be<br />\nout to improve on their 1970<br />\nmark of 7-2, their best in twenty<br />\nyears.<br />\nMuhlenberg Head Coach<br />\nFrank Marino has been playing.<br />\ndown his team's prospects,<br />\nbemoaning his loss of fourteen<br />\nstarters from last year's squad.<br />\nBut what he hasn't been<br />\nemphasizing is that he has<br />\nthirty-one returning lettermen,<br />\nthat he has a pair of 210-pound<br />\nrunning backs, that his defensive<br />\nline averages 215 pounds per man<br />\nand that over seventy candidates<br />\ntried out for the team. Blue Jay<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox rates the<br />\nMules as \"one of the tougher<br />\nMAC teams\" he will be facing<br />\nand \"a -definite contender\" for<br />\nthe conference title.<br />\nCertain to be in the spotlight<br />\nfor the Mules is quarterback Ed<br />\nDiYanni,who came off the bench<br />\nin last year's encounter to spark<br />\nhis team to victory. Senior<br />\nrunning backs Carl Evans and Ed<br />\nMitchell figure to give DiYanni<br />\nmore .than adequate help.<br />\nMuhlenberg's defensive unit is<br />\nanchored by an overpoweringly<br />\nstrong front four:Tom Crockett,<br />\nRichard Toth, Dan Ayres, and<br />\nTom Easen should be even more<br />\nformidable this year with<br />\n<br />\nanother season of experience<br />\nunder their belts.<br />\nThe Blue Jays, on the other<br />\nhand, will be seeking to regain<br />\nthe MAC Southern Division flag<br />\nthat they lost last year to<br />\nMoravian. Coach Dennis Cox<br />\npromises a \"balanced attack\" for<br />\nhis first game at the helm of the<br />\nJays, adding, \"We're going to<br />\nplay possession-type offense.<br />\nWe're not going to rely on tricks,<br />\nbut on good old tough,<br />\nfundamental football.\"<br />\nCox announced a tentative<br />\nstarting lineup Tuesday for the<br />\nseason opener. Although many of the names are familiar, only<br />\noffensive right tackle Mike<br />\nMalloy will be back at his old<br />\nposition from the starting lineup<br />\nthat opened against Muhlenberg<br />\nlast September. Sam Palmisano<br />\nwill be at center, Norm Gross<br />\nand Joe Ouslander at guard,<br />\nBarry Van Orman, along with<br />\nMalloy, at tackle, with Mike<br />\nBogdan the tight end and Grant<br />\nShevchik the wide receiver.

Reactions to the report<br />\nrange from praise to disregard.<br />\nA major consideration in<br />\ncalling for the Anderson report<br />\nwas to investigate the methods<br />\nby which the University<br /><br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower<br /><br />\nobtained government funds.<br />\nA similar report was ordered<br />\nlast October by a resolution of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, to<br />\ninvestigate the extent to which<br />\nthe government funds affect<br />\nUniversity policy.<br />\nEarlier this week, Dr. Steven<br />\nMuller termed the Anderson<br />\nReport as \"very incomplete\"<br /><br />\nadding that he had sent it back<br />\nto Anderson for further work.<br />\nOn Tuesday of this week,<br />\nMuller defended the Anderson<br />\nReport and said it contained<br />\nmuchglew information.<br />\nExcellent Study<br />\nPresident Eisenhower noted,<br />\n\"The Anderson study is an<br />\nexcellent study of all existing<br />\nFederal action affecting all<br />\nuniversities.\"<br />\nThe Board of Trustees,<br />\nhowever, seem to disregard the<br />\nreport altogether. Mr. Alonzo G.<br />\nDecker Jr., a member of the<br />\nBoard, stated that he had never<br />\nheard of the report. The same<br />\nresponse was indicated from<br />\nother members of the Board<br />\nwho were questioned on the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThe Anderson Report was<br />\noriginated in the spring of 1970<br />\nby then President Lincoln<br />\nGordon. It was intended as a<br />\nstudy of the channels through<br />\nwhich the University could<br />\nobtain Federal funds.<br />\nGovernment Restrictions<br />\nIn October of that same year,<br />\nthe Board of Trustees called for<br />\nan investigation of the<br />\nUniversity's ties with the<br />\ngovernment, with an intent to<br />\n-disclose restrictions placed upon<br />\nthe University by the<br />\ngovernment.<br />\n(continued on page 5)<br /><br />\nFood Service Boycott<br />\nRejected by SC Vote<br />\nBy BOB ROMNEY<br />\nIn its meeting last Monday<br />\nnight, the Student Council<br />\nrejected a motion to support the<br />\nLevering Hall food services<br />\nboycott, and heard a proposal to<br />\ncentralize all student<br />\ngovernment funds.<br />\nS.C.

She revealed that<br />\nfor the calendar to be successful,<br />\nthe business community of<br />\nBaltimore would have to be<br />\nasked for support through<br />\nadvertisements.<br />\nReject Boycott<br />\nA food boycott proposal was<br />\nrejected because S.C. members<br />\ncontended that a successful<br />\nboycott would result in no food<br />\nservice.<br />\nEsta Baker initially<br />\ncommented,\"The food is devoid<br />\nof any nutritional value.\" Since<br />\nthe boycott is already in<br />\nprogress, council members<br />\ndebated whether or not Student<br />\nCouncil should actively support<br />\nthe boycott. Many council<br />\nmembers felt that if the boycott<br />\nwas successful, no food service<br />\nwould be provided at all.<br />\nSophomore Representative<br />\nHoffman proposed a central<br />\nfund for all undergraduate<br />\nstudent government<br />\norganizations. According to<br />\nHoffman's plan, each<br />\norganization would have a<br />\nbudget, but would be able to<br />\ndraw more than its regular<br />\nallocation with approval of the<br /><br />\nother organizations.<br />\nSince the Student Council<br />\nexpects to receive no financial<br />\nsupport from the administration<br />\nin the next school year, the S.C.<br />\nmembers noted that the<br />\nproposed student activities fee<br />\nhike would restore the council's<br />\n$10,000 cut from last year.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\nNEWSINIETTER<br />\nVol. LXXVI, No. 5<br /><br />\nFriday', September 24, 1971, Baltimore, Maryland<br /><br />\n76th Year<br /><br />\nDecision by December<br /><br />\nBologna Center In Doubt<br />\nBy CHRIS HELMERS<br />\nA tabled bill- in the Italian<br />\nsenate and ad hoc citizens'<br />\ngroups hold the key to the<br />\nfuture of the School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies<br />\nbranch in Bologna, Italy<br />\nThe Bologna branch showed a<br />\ndeficit of $30,000 last year, and<br />\nif no new funds are forthcoming<br />\nthis year, the deficit will amount<br />\nto over $80,000, forcing the<br />\nclosing of the school.<br />\nThomas Hugo, business<br />\nmanager of SAIS, said, \"We're<br />\nkeeping our fingers crossed.\" A<br />\ndecision on closing will have to<br />\nbe made by late December.<br />\nThe Italian bill was passed by<br />\nthe Chamber of Deputies a year<br />\nago, but the upper house has not<br />\nyet acted upon it. The bill would<br />\ncall for an annual appropriation<br />\nof $85,000 for the next five<br />\nyears, to be paid by the Italian<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nPossible Sources<br />\nAside from the bill, two<br />\nother funding sources are<br />\npossible: a recently formed<br />\n\"Leonardo da Vinci\" Fund, a<br />\nUniversity-sponsored drive to<br />\nraise funds for the school, and a<br />\ncitizens' committee led by<br />\nMaryland Senator Charles<br />\nMathias, seeking private donors<br />\nand trying to negotiate more<br />\nfunds from the State<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nDr. Milton Eisenhower<br />\nreceived the sum of $4.247<br />\nmillion in 1958 to begin the<br />\nprogram and maintain it for ten<br />\nyears.

Past<br />\ndeficits have been absorbed by<br />\nthe Washington SAIS, but<br />\nnational and University fiscal<br />\ntroubles have made this no<br />\nlonger possible, according to<br />\nHugo.<br />\nFund Sources<br />\nThe program has been<br />\nsupported by Italian funds, a<br />\ngrant of $75,000 from the U.S.<br />\nState Dept., HEW money and<br />\ncontributions from corporations<br />\nand individuals. The Italian bill<br />\ncalls for an increase of $19.000<br />\nannually over previous<br />\nsubsidizations.<br />\nThe Bologna school is an<br />\noverseas extension of the<br />\nWashington-based SAIS, with<br />\nover 260 enrolled.

Her<br />\njob, in contrast with most on campus, focuses entirely<br />\non undergraduates.<br />\nIn addition to teaching, her position includes the task<br />\nof formulating direction for the undergraduate French<br />\nprogram. In cooperation with Beatrice Birnbaum, who<br />\nfills the same position, she determines what the undergraduates French program will offer each year.<br /><br />\nWorking within this assumption\u2014that languages are interesting and valuable, and that students will respond to<br />\n\u2022 them if they're properly presented\u2014she and her associates have worked on a continually evolving program of<br />\nundergraduate French \"It's a challenge trying to create<br />\na program which can deal effectively with teaching the<br />\nlanguage to these students,\" she said.

Our editorial, in what was meant as a<br />\nsomewhat tongue-in-cheek reference to a series of articles<br />\nrun in the News-Letter last year about government<br />\nfunding, put too much of the blame for the situation on an<br />\nadministrative assistant, who drew up a report similar to<br />\nthe one called for by the Board of Trustees, and seemingly<br />\nwas more or less an innocent bystander in an<br />\nadministration mess. We would like to apologize to him<br />\nand to anyone else who may have been offended by the<br />\nlanguage used in our editorial.<br />\nWe do, however, find it somewhat odd that Dr. Muller<br />\nshould rush so quickly to the defense of this report, since<br />\nit was his statements that led us to believe that it was less<br />\nthan adequate. We also would like to point out that Dr.<br />\nMuller gets his feathers ruffled fairly easily when a member<br />\nof the administration is involved, but isn't quite as upset<br />\nwhen it's the undergraduate at the receiving end. Perhaps<br />\nthe provost could say he's sorry that we have to cat plastic<br />\nfood at Levering while he's dining in the Faculty Club. Or<br />\nmaybe he could express his regrets that no substantive<br />\naction has been taken to dramatically increase the number<br />\nof undergraduate course offerings. Or perhaps the school's<br />\nnumber two man could apologize for the slap in the face<br />\nhe gave the students when he told them that there are no<br />\nplans to pursue the investigation of Hopkins dependence<br />\non the government. Okay, we've done our apologizing Dr.<br />\nMuller,. now it's time for you to do yours.<br /><br />\nSC abdication<br />\nThe Student Council has backed away from action to<br />\nimprove the Levering food service by rejecting a boycott<br />\nproposal. The reasoning of the bold SC members was that<br />\nif the boycott was successful there would be no food<br />\nservice at all. The council, which annually attempts to<br />\ndissolve itself because it has no power, should not wonder<br />\nat its own weakness when it so clearly abdicates a<br />\nleadership role in improving campus life. There is both a<br />\nneed for a boycott and alternative food services, including<br />\nan open Faculty Club, and the Student Council has failed<br />\nto press for either. By doing so, the council has<br />\nundermined any effectiveness the committee to suggest<br />\nchanges to Macke Company might have had. That<br />\ncommittee, incidentally, is under Student Council<br />\nPresident Gerald Bates, and if his aggressiveness is reflected<br />\nin the SC boycott rejection, then we can resign ourselves<br />\nto stale, unhealthy food for the rest of the year.<br />\nAt the present time, there is not a strong, organized<br />\nboycott. Instead, there is a listless, half-hearted one<br />\nstemming more from the sickening nature of the cafeteria<br />\nthan from anyone's conscious effort. Equally evident is the<br />\nlack of pressure to make the facilities of the Faculty Club<br />\navailable to all members of the Hopkins community. The<br />\nresult of this passive acceptance of an intolerable situation<br />\nis that Levering Hall has been killed as the only social<br />\ncenter on campus and students are surviving on<br />\nHarleyburgers. Student leaders, including those on the<br />\nStudent Council, must take the initiative to bring decent<br />\nfood to undergraduates.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\nSept. 24, 1971<br /><br />\n\"That Next Appointment Better Be Good\"<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour allegations in the<br />\nNews-Letter of September 21<br />\nconcerning the work of Mr.<br />\nWayne Anderson are without<br />\nfoundation in fact.

Your seemingly<br />\nirreconcilable attitude towards the 'ROTC is one<br />\nthat I have difficulty understanding. As you well<br />\nknow, this country was founded close to two<br />\ncenturies ago on the premises of the natural<br />\nrights of man studied and refined in the<br />\nEnlightenment. One of those rights is the right of<br />\nliberty, which was defined in the Declaration of<br />\nthe Rights of Man and Citizen as the freedom to<br />\ndo anything that does not harm your fellow<br />\ncitizen. I ask you, when was the last time you<br />\nwere molested by a member of the ROTC?<br />\nProbably never.<br />\nUnfortunately, many ROTC menannot ,make<br />\nthe same statement, for you, and those like you<br />\nwho claim to bear love for your fellow man have,<br />\nunder your self-created halo of self-righteousness,<br />\nnot only attacked cadets and destroyed<br />\ngovernment property, but have decreed that the<br />\nmilitary should not have the right to hold its<br />\nclasses and training on campus. On the other<br />\nhand, you demand the right to bring in whatever<br />\ntype of speaker that you want, even those who<br />\nincite you and others to destroy the university<br />\nthat you came to under your own freedom of<br />\nchoice. This hypocritical stance is in direct<br />\nconflict with your moral principles.<br />\nThe News\u2014Letter made the statement that<br />\n\"The hostility to the military is among the most<br />\nwelcome changes \"as values of recent years.\" To<br />\nparaphrase the great American philosopher,<br />\nSantayana, those who failed to learn history are<br />\ncondemned to repeat it. Need I remind you that<br />\nthe pacifist sentiments of Britain, France and the<br />\nUnited States during the 1930's permitted the<br />\nrise of such lovables as Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo,<br />\nFranco, Salazar, Chiang Kai-Slick and others?<br />\nNeed I remind you that WW 11 was fought to<br />\ncomplete WW I, which was caused not by<br />\nmilitarism but by the mistakes of politicians?<br />\nNeed I remind you that the U.

If you consider the U. S.Army<br />\nto be a deep-rooted institution, look at some<br />\nother nations and then think again. Most<br />\ncountries do not even allow its youth the liberty<br />\nof a draft, or choice of branch of service, or the<br />\ncomparative comforts of our army. Conscription<br />\nis mandatory almost worldwide, and their armies<br />\ndo not enjoy half the privileges that ours does.<br />\nOurs is not a deep-rooted army, for there are<br />\nrelatively few career officers and professional<br />\nsoldiers.<br />\nOver 40% of our officers corps are ROTC<br />\ngraduates, men who have had college educations,<br />\nand at a civilian college such as Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThese are well-educated civilians serving a couple<br />\nof years as an officer, and getting invaluable<br />\nexperience as an executive in their early twenties.<br />\nRead what business executives have to say about<br />\nhiring ROTC grads. A copy of their statements is<br />\navailable in the ROTC building, a building that<br />\nyou might want to visit sometime to learn a little<br />\nabout ROTC.

No need to worry about<br />\na junta here.<br />\nYou mention that the army is destructive.<br />\nWould you say that on the graves of William<br />\nGorgas and Walter Reed, the men who found the<br />\ncures for malaria and yellow fever, respectively?<br />\nWould you say that to the survivors of Auschwitz<br />\nand Buchenwald, people who not be survivors if<br />\nthe Army did not arrive in time%<br />\nThis is not a perfect world; an army is needed<br />\nto do the dirty work of fighting and dying so<br />\nthat you and others may have the right to say<br />\nand do what they want to do. Come over to the<br />\nROTC building and talk to Col. Parmly and his<br />\nstaff, or to some of the cadets. Read a little on<br />\nROTC, and see what it is about.

In his way stood Father<br />\nGrandier, a priest who all but<br />\nruled the city \u2014 in a very<br />\npriestly sort of way, of course.<br />\nAlthough a powerful and<br />\nrespected man of the cloth, he is<br />\nalso a great despoiler of young<br /><br />\nmaidens. One of these he falls in<br />\nlove with and marries.<br />\nDriven<br />\nSister Jeanne, a hunchbacked<br />\nnun who has long been in love<br />\nwith Grandier from afar is driven<br />\nby her jealousy and madness to<br />\nmake accusations to the effect<br />\nthat Grandier is possessed by the<br />\ndevil and that he has corrupted<br />\nher and the sisters of her order<br />\nwith the devil's lust.<br />\nPlaying right into Richelieu's<br />\nhands, there follows a trial and<br />\nprolonged attempts at exorcism<br />\nby one Father Barre. He appears<br />\nto be more possessed than<br />\nanyone else. The remainder of<br />\nthe film consists of Grandier's<br />\ntrial, torture, and inevitable<br />\ndeath.<br />\nOliver Reed, a veteran of<br />\nRussell's \"Women in Love,\" is<br />\nthe one truly magnificent thing<br />\nin the film His Grandier is so<br />\nincredibly human and martyred<br />\nas to be unreal \u2014 yet he<br />\ntriumphs to the end as by far the<br />\nstrongest character.<br />\nMiraculous<br />\nVanessa Redgrave shines in<br />\nher role as the sadly demented<br />\nSister Jeanne.

The<br />\nfollowing are excerpts of the<br />\nlengthy conversation, touching<br />\non many aspects of Hopkins'<br />\nathletics.<br />\nN-L: Mr. Turner, how long have.<br />\nyou been director of physical<br />\neducation and athletics here at<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nMT: I've been director since<br />\nabout February of 1950.<br />\nN-L: If you retired tomorrow,<br />\nwhat would you consider your<br />\nmajor accomplishment during<br />\nthese past 20 years?<br />\nMT: I guess the thing that I feel<br />\nthe most comfortable about is<br />\nthe fact that we've been able to<br />\nmaintain a pretty full program<br />\nof athletics over these twenty<br />\nyears with really a very minimal<br />\nbudget. There have been many<br />\ntimes when we've had<br />\ndifficulties in keeping a program<br />\ngoing, in maintaining a full<br />\nintercollegiate, intramural and<br /><br />\nphysical education program with<br />\nthe resources we've had.<br />\nFortunately, we've been able<br />\nto avoid losing any of the<br />\nprogram in all this time and I'm<br />\nhappy that we've been able to<br />\nprovide the opportunities we<br />\nhave for the many kids to play<br />\nsports and have athletic<br />\nopportunities.<br />\nN-L: Would you consider<br />\nanything to be a failure on your<br />\npart or on the part of Hopkins?<br />\nMT: I suppose -every director<br />\nfeels failure-when he's unable to<br />\nget enough money to do all the<br />\nthings he'd like to be able to do<br />\nwith his programs. In our case<br />\nthe monetary decisions have<br />\nbeen made by somebody higher<br />\nthan me; the only thing I can<br />\nfeel is that maybe I'm not as<br />\ngood a salesman as I would like<br />\nto be to get more money for the<br />\nprogram. Through the years,<br />\nthough, we've been reasonably<br />\nweel treated. Obviously I wish<br />\nwe could be better treated.<br />\nN-L: If I whipped out my wallet<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nspoRTs<br /><br />\nBooters Lengthen<br />\nStreak To Three<br />\nBy JEFF FORMAN<br />\nRebounding back from a<br />\ntough loss to Calvert Hall last<br />\nweek, the Hopkins' soccer team<br />\neasily defeated Baltimore<br />\nCommunity College on Saturday<br />\nby a score of six to one,<br />\nexhibiting a bit of hustle and<br />\ndetermination along the way.<br />\nTuesday, the Blue Jays<br />\noutclassed Arundel Community<br />\nCollege eight to five. Scott<br />\nTyner and Roberto Aguero each<br />\nhad a pair of goals in a game<br />\npretty much dominated by the<br />\nBlue Jays. The score at the half<br />\nstood at seven to zero, so Coach<br />\nRobert Oliver rested the first<br />\nstring during the econd half.<br />\nHopkins kept the ball in their<br />\npossession throughout most of<br />\nthe game and kept the Arundel<br />\ngoalie busy with plenty of shots<br />\nHoping to extend their streak<br /><br />\nto three wins, the booters took<br />\non Maryland's top-rated Morgan<br />\nState on Wednesday. In a very<br />\nphysical game the Jays<br />\noutmuscled State two to one.<br />\nThe first quarter ended scoreless<br />\nwith Hopkins looking the<br />\naggressor, although somewhat<br />\nunorganized. But in the early<br />\nminutes of the second period,<br />\nScott Tyner battled for<br />\npossession of the right wing and<br />\ncrossed beautifully to Mike<br />\nHogan who headed the ball into<br />\nthe net for the .first point. The<br />\nsecond point came on a penalty<br />\nkick awarded because Morgan<br />\nState neglected to report a goalie<br />\nchange. State retaliated with a<br />\ngoal of its own but at the final<br />\nhorn it was Hopkins on top two<br />\nto one.<br />\nTomorrow is the first regular<br />\nseason game and kick-off time is<br />\n12:00 noon.<br /><br />\nSports Briefs<br />\nFOOTBALL MANAGERS<br />\nThe varsity football team has<br />\na great need for managers and<br />\ntrainers. Anyone who would like<br />\nto serve in this capacity is urged<br />\nto see Coach Cox at the Athletic<br />\nCenter or on the practice field.<br />\nTheNews-Letter BIA football<br />\nteam is reported to be the<br />\nstrongest the paper has fielded in<br />\nover 75 years. When asked about<br />\nthe chances of the team, head<br />\nstrategist Alice Weaver said<br />\n\"This team is going to surprise a<br />\nlot of folks.\" The squad,<br />\nthe Paper Tigers ,is expected to<br />\nshow up for most contests.<br /><br />\nright now and offered the<br />\nathletic program $20,000, how<br />\nwould you spend it?<br />\nMT: They're a few pieces of<br />\nmajor equipment that I would<br />\nlike to buy: namely, one more<br />\nof those universal gyms, our's<br />\nhas been extremely well used by<br />\npeople of all ages and for so<br />\nmany purposes.<br />\nWhile our uniforms on the<br />\nwhole are in pretty good shape<br />\ndue to heavy buying two years<br />\nago, some of them, particularly<br />\nfootball and lacrosse uniforms,<br />\nare showing signs of wear and<br />\ntear. They would need to be<br />\nreplaced.<br />\nWe'd like to buy new sets of<br />\ngame sweatclothes also.<br />\nN-L:. Do you contemplate<br />\nexpansion of the athletic plant<br />\nin the near future?<br />\nMT: I think the most critical<br />\nneed probably that we have is<br />\nadditional tennis courts. Six<br />\ncourts for a student body<br />\npopulation of approximately<br />\n3500 is very little.<br />\nWe certainly are extremely<br />\ncrowded on our outdoor<br />\nfacilities in the spring when we<br />\ntry to run an intramural<br />\nprogram. Furthermore, if we<br />\nbegin to have an interest as the<br />\nnumber of women increase on<br />\nour campus, and intercollegiate<br />\nathletics for women become a<br />\npart of our program, we would<br />\nhave to cut somebody<br />\nsomewhere in order to do that.<br />\nSo our outside facilities are also<br />\nour poorest area facilities at the<br />\npresent time.<br />\nN-L: How long do you expect it<br />\nto be before there are women<br />\nparticipating on intercollegiate<br />\nteams such as basketball,<br />\nvolleyball or tennis.<br />\nMT: I have no idea, Bruce. It<br />\njust depents on who comes in as<br />\nstudents, and what their drives<br />\nand feelings toward playing<br />\nintercollegiate athletics really<br />\nare.<br />\nI know that nationally there is<br />\na trend for more and more<br />\nwomen's intercoolegiate<br />\nathletics on the same general<br />\norganizational level as men.<br />\nBut it will come only as a<br />\nconsequence of the individual<br />\ndesires of the students that we<br />\ntake. This may run to a<br />\nbasketball situation, a hockey<br />\nsituation or a synchronized<br />\nswimming situation. We'll just<br />\nhave to wait and see where the<br />\ninterests and demand are, and<br />\nwhether our facilities can<br />\nincorporate it.<br />\nN-L: How would these girls go<br />\nabout forming intercollegiate<br />\nathletic teams?<br /><br />\nTICKET BOOKS<br />\nTicket books for this year's<br />\nsports will be available at the<br />\nNewton H. White Athletic<br />\nCenter from 9:00AM till 4:30<br />\nPM today, and from 9:00 AM<br />\ntill 2:00 PM on Saturday.<br />\nIncidentally, tomorrow will<br />\nbe the last day on which you can<br />\npick up your ticket books.<br /><br />\nMT: Actually, I suppose they<br />\nwould go through the same<br />\nprocesses as men's teams do.<br />\nMost directors would not involve<br />\na major facility or a major<br />\namount of money for a group of<br />\ngirls who came in and said that<br />\nthey have enough girls for a<br />\nbasketball team. This would<br />\ninvolve making adjustments of<br />\npresent commitments, and, this<br />\nwould also involve, in terms of a<br />\nschedule, making committments<br />\nto other people. No one is<br />\ninterested in making up a<br /><br />\nschedule and finding that<br />\nhalfway through the season, the<br />\nteam begins to disintegrate.<br />\nIt would probably follow the<br />\nsame general pattern as boys in<br />\nthe sense that a club team would<br />\nbe started, and play whatever<br />\nkind of local competition could<br />\nbe developed. We would then see<br />\nwhether the interest is<br />\nmaintained, and if it seems that<br />\nthe team can sustain itself for a<br />\ncouple years, it finally works its<br />\nway into the regular program.<br />\nN-L: Are there a large number of<br />\nwomen using Hopkins' gym<br />\nfacilities at present?<br />\nMT: I think that the swimming<br />\npool has noticed a marked<br />\nincrease in number of girls in the<br />\nrecreational swim period.<br />\nAs far as seeing them on the<br />\ngym floor,I can't say that I have,<br />\nbut I have noticed them on the<br />\ntennis courts.<br />\nN-L: It's been about a year and a<br />\nhalf since the decision was made<br />\nto end compulsory physical<br />\neducation. How wise a move was<br />\nthis, in your estimation?<br />\nMT: I don't think that anybody<br />\ncan really tell unless we gave<br />\nfitness tests. In truth the human<br />\nbody is the probably the most<br />\nadaptible and most<br />\nindestructible piece of<br />\nmachinery the world \u2022 has ever<br />\nknown. You can abuse it very,<br />\nvery much without it ever really<br />\nbecoming apparent.<br />\nI don't think in terms of<br />\nfitness in the college student<br />\nthat it makes a great deal of<br />\ndifference whether he's taking<br />\nphysical education or not. What<br />\nI think will be a difference is 15<br />\nyears from now, when he hasn't<br />\nlearned enough games or things<br />\nto do and he begins to run down<br />\na little bit and the doctor says,<br />\n\"Man,I think you ought to start<br />\nsome excercise some way,\" and<br />\nwhat does the guy do?Suppose<br />\nhe doesn't know how to play<br />\ntennis or badminton or<br />\nsomething to give him some<br />\ncardiovascular activity? So he<br />\nends up jogging, a terrible way<br />\nto get physical activity in my<br />\nviewpoint.<br />\nSo, in the long run, this will<br />\nhurt them by not exposing them<br />\nto as many activities.<br />\nN-L: This is a two part question:<br />\nFirst of all, from your contact<br />\nwith other athletic directors,<br />\nhave a lot of schools gone<br />\ntoward eliminating compulsory<br />\nphysical education?<br />\nSecondly, do you think<br />\nHopkins will ever return to such<br />\na program?<br />\nMT: I think that two and three<br />\nyears ago, Bruce, that there was<br />\na trend to do this sort of thing. I<br />\ndon't think that anybody in the<br />\nlast year has lost physical<br />\neducation. In a few cases, there<br />\nhave been rather serious studies<br />\nof it, and a real honest attempt<br />\nwas made to evaluate the<br />\nphysical education program at<br />\ninstitutions and most of those in<br />\nthe last year have survived even<br />\non a compulsory basis.<br /><br />\nMarshall Turner<br />\nI think the real push is off as<br />\nfar as students forcing physical<br />\neducation out only because it's<br />\nrequired.<br />\nOne of the most interesting<br />\nthings about all of these schools<br />\nthat have been forced to drop<br />\nphysical education, almost,<br />\nwithout exception, students<br />\nwould admit that the program<br />\nwas good and they enjoyed it<br />\nwhen they were in it and the<br />\nonly objection was that it was<br />\nrequired. But obviously if it isn't<br />\nrequired it isn't going to reach<br />\nthe fellows who need it the<br />\nmost.<br />\nAs t9 the program's possible<br />\nreturn, the climate right now is<br />\nnot right. But I think that<br />\ncumulatively we will find that<br />\nkids will have less interest in<br />\nin tramurals and won't<br />\nparticipate in them unless they<br />\nhave already learned how to<br />\nparticipate in them before they<br />\ngot to college, and we may find<br />\nthat slowly the interest in<br />\nphysical activities classes will<br />\npick up. We've noticed that the<br />\n60 to 75 already active in our<br />\nclasses already have a bit of<br />\ninterest and would like to learn a<br />\nlittle more or something else...<br />\nSo, compulsory physical<br />\neducation may come, but not<br />\nimmediately.<br />\nN-L Is it still necessary to charge<br />\nfor entrance to football,<br />\nbasketball, and lacrosse games?<br />\nHow long will this procedure<br />\ncontinue?<br />\nMT I think the institution of an<br />\nadmission charge here was<br />\noccasioned by the University's<br />\nfinancial picture. Let us realize<br />\nthat the revenue so gained is not<br />\ngoing ta keep the university out<br />\nof debt, but if you'll go back a<br />\nbit, you might realize that Dr.<br />\nGordon at that time might have<br />\nbeen searching for any 5, 10, 15,<br />\nor 20 thousand dollars he could<br />\nfind in savings or income.<br />\nThe attitude toward charging,<br />\nI think, has changed since 1934<br />\nor 1937 when it was instituted<br />\nand the reasons for doing it then<br />\nwere much more vital and<br />\ncrucial to intercollegiate<br />\nathletics than they are now. In<br />\nour case, the gate receipts don't<br />\nfigure into our budget at all;<br />\nthey're just general university<br />\nmoneys... So charging admission<br />\nto selected sports events hasn't<br />\naffected our program.<br />\nI don't know whether there is<br />\nany sentiment to change this<br />\nprogram. This year, I'd like to<br />\nsay, we have reduced the<br />\nadmission charge for students<br />\nwithout tickets.<br />\nN-L Thank you, Mr. Turner.<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nSept. 24, 1971<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nJay Football Squad Faces Strong Challenge<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nfootball team will face a stiff<br />\nchallenge in its 1971 opener<br />\ntomorrow afternoon when<br />\nMuhlenberg College comes to<br />\ntown for a 2:00 game at<br />\nHomewood Field. The Mules,<br />\n16-6 winners over Hopkins last<br />\nyear and runners-up along with<br />\nthe Blue Jays for the MAC<br />\nSouthern Division crown, will be<br />\nout to improve on their 1970<br />\nmark of 7-2, their best in twenty<br />\nyears.<br />\nMuhlenberg Head Coach<br />\nFrank Marino has been playing.<br />\ndown his team's prospects,<br />\nbemoaning his loss of fourteen<br />\nstarters from last year's squad.<br />\nBut what he hasn't been<br />\nemphasizing is that he has<br />\nthirty-one returning lettermen,<br />\nthat he has a pair of 210-pound<br />\nrunning backs, that his defensive<br />\nline averages 215 pounds per man<br />\nand that over seventy candidates<br />\ntried out for the team. Blue Jay<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox rates the<br />\nMules as \"one of the tougher<br />\nMAC teams\" he will be facing<br />\nand \"a -definite contender\" for<br />\nthe conference title.<br />\nCertain to be in the spotlight<br />\nfor the Mules is quarterback Ed<br />\nDiYanni,who came off the bench<br />\nin last year's encounter to spark<br />\nhis team to victory. Senior<br />\nrunning backs Carl Evans and Ed<br />\nMitchell figure to give DiYanni<br />\nmore .than adequate help.<br />\nMuhlenberg's defensive unit is<br />\nanchored by an overpoweringly<br />\nstrong front four:Tom Crockett,<br />\nRichard Toth, Dan Ayres, and<br />\nTom Easen should be even more<br />\nformidable this year with<br /><br />\nanother season of experience<br />\nunder their belts.<br />\nThe Blue Jays, on the other<br />\nhand, will be seeking to regain<br />\nthe MAC Southern Division flag<br />\nthat they lost last year to<br />\nMoravian. Coach Dennis Cox<br />\npromises a \"balanced attack\" for<br />\nhis first game at the helm of the<br />\nJays, adding, \"We're going to<br />\nplay possession-type offense.<br />\nWe're not going to rely on tricks,<br />\nbut on good old tough,<br />\nfundamental football.\"<br />\nCox announced a tentative<br />\nstarting lineup Tuesday for the<br />\nseason opener. Although many of the names are familiar, only<br />\noffensive right tackle Mike<br />\nMalloy will be back at his old<br />\nposition from the starting lineup<br />\nthat opened against Muhlenberg<br />\nlast September. Sam Palmisano<br />\nwill be at center, Norm Gross<br />\nand Joe Ouslander at guard,<br />\nBarry Van Orman, along with<br />\nMalloy, at tackle, with Mike<br />\nBogdan the tight end and Grant<br />\nShevchik the wide receiver. Jack<br />\nThomas will be lining up behind<br />\nPalmisano at quarterback, with<br />\nPat Neary, Jim Ferguson, and<br />\nco-captain Butch Robey the<br />\nrunning backs.<br />\nThe defensive line, from left<br />\nto right, shapes up with<br />\nco-captain Eric \"Bazooka\"<br />\nBergofsky, Mike O'Brien, Gross,<br />\nand Ferguson.
