Time after time this question is asked by men in college, more often by those in their<br />\nJunior or Senior year than by men who have just begun. Several<br />\nanswers can, of course, be given. Few will deny the advantages<br />\nof the cultural background which is formed by'a broad choice of<br />\ncourses and by contact with the men of the faculty. It is practically self-evident. That a college course is essential to the man<br />\nwho wishes to specialize, whether he intends to become a chemist<br />\nor a professor of English.<br />\nSound as they are, these answers are not entirely satisfactory.<br />\nWhat,of the man who intends to \"go into business\"? He, by the<br />\nway, is the man who most often questions the value of a college<br />\neducation. Let us suppose that he has completed his junior year.<br />\nLooking back on his three years he is bewildered and discouraged.<br />\nIt seems that all he has gathered from his courses is a number of<br />\nrandom facts and a few theoretical principles. He sees men who<br />\nhave gone to work immediately after finishing high school getting<br />\nahead, and he sees college men who have failed to make good.<br />\nTaken as a whole, these facts are enough to make many a<br />\nman feel that he is wasting time at college. If he is of the type<br />\nthat will always be a follower he is quite right; he is wasting time.<br />\nIf, however, he is a man who will forge ahead, who will develop<br />\ninto a leader, college can be of the greatest value to him. Courses<br />\nwhich he may consider trivial or pointless will give him a background which will enable him to correlate isolated facts and events<br />\nand in some measure to interpret their significance. The theories<br />\nwhich at the time he learned them he may have dismissed as valueless will take on a new importance. Whether he sells automobiles or manufactures shoes, he can look behind a mass of<br />\ndetail and see the fundamental laws of supply and demand at<br />\nwork. Not only will he see and understand these principles, he<br />\nmay be able to predict effects from given causes.<br />\nThe prestige which accompanies a diploma ought not to be<br />\noverlooked, even though the number of men finishing college is<br />\ninfinitely greater than in the days when the tradition of the superiority of the college man was begun. In the last analysis, however, to use a platitude which has stood the test of time, a man's<br />\nsuccess or failure rests with himself. A college education can<br />\ndo no more than help a man; but that it is an advantage there is<br />\nno doubt.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the Oxford system, \"perhaps the most fruitful<br />\npart of an Oxford or Cambridge education is that which is given<br />\nunofficially, in the course of the student's social relations with his<br />\nteachers. Intensive study is tempered by conversation. It is in<br />\ninformal symposiums at night, over the fire, in the rooms of some<br />\nsympathetic and intelligent don, that the undergraduate conies to<br />\nbe interested in, and familiar with, ideas. To discuss the problems of life with a highly cultured man, not too much older than<br />\nhimself to be unable to understand his adolescent point of view,<br />\nis the most liberal education a youth can possibly have\".<br />\nThis is sorely lacking in American undergraduate schools.<br />\nEducation is a cold, matter-of-fact proposition which becomes, not<br />\nthe center of the student's life, but merely a phase of it.

Time after time this question is asked by men in college, more often by those in their<br />\nJunior or Senior year than by men who have just begun. Several<br />\nanswers can, of course, be given. Few will deny the advantages<br />\nof the cultural background which is formed by'a broad choice of<br />\ncourses and by contact with the men of the faculty. It is practically self-evident. That a college course is essential to the man<br />\nwho wishes to specialize, whether he intends to become a chemist<br />\nor a professor of English.<br />\nSound as they are, these answers are not entirely satisfactory.<br />\nWhat,of the man who intends to \"go into business\"? He, by the<br />\nway, is the man who most often questions the value of a college<br />\neducation. Let us suppose that he has completed his junior year.<br />\nLooking back on his three years he is bewildered and discouraged.<br />\nIt seems that all he has gathered from his courses is a number of<br />\nrandom facts and a few theoretical principles. He sees men who<br />\nhave gone to work immediately after finishing high school getting<br />\nahead, and he sees college men who have failed to make good.<br />\nTaken as a whole, these facts are enough to make many a<br />\nman feel that he is wasting time at college. If he is of the type<br />\nthat will always be a follower he is quite right; he is wasting time.<br />\nIf, however, he is a man who will forge ahead, who will develop<br />\ninto a leader, college can be of the greatest value to him. Courses<br />\nwhich he may consider trivial or pointless will give him a background which will enable him to correlate isolated facts and events<br />\nand in some measure to interpret their significance. The theories<br />\nwhich at the time he learned them he may have dismissed as valueless will take on a new importance. Whether he sells automobiles or manufactures shoes, he can look behind a mass of<br />\ndetail and see the fundamental laws of supply and demand at<br />\nwork. Not only will he see and understand these principles, he<br />\nmay be able to predict effects from given causes.<br />\nThe prestige which accompanies a diploma ought not to be<br />\noverlooked, even though the number of men finishing college is<br />\ninfinitely greater than in the days when the tradition of the superiority of the college man was begun. In the last analysis, however, to use a platitude which has stood the test of time, a man's<br />\nsuccess or failure rests with himself. A college education can<br />\ndo no more than help a man; but that it is an advantage there is<br />\nno doubt.<br /><br />\nAccording to the Oxford system, \"perhaps the most fruitful<br />\npart of an Oxford or Cambridge education is that which is given<br />\nunofficially, in the course of the student's social relations with his<br />\nteachers. Intensive study is tempered by conversation. It is in<br />\ninformal symposiums at night, over the fire, in the rooms of some<br />\nsympathetic and intelligent don, that the undergraduate conies to<br />\nbe interested in, and familiar with, ideas. To discuss the problems of life with a highly cultured man, not too much older than<br />\nhimself to be unable to understand his adolescent point of view,<br />\nis the most liberal education a youth can possibly have\".<br />\nThis is sorely lacking in American undergraduate schools.<br />\nEducation is a cold, matter-of-fact proposition which becomes, not<br />\nthe center of the student's life, but merely a phase of it.
