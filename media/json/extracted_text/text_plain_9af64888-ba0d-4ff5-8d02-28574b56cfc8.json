Should you throw -up your<br />\nhands and quit? I say no! I say you must attack, grapple,<br />\ncope! I say America did not become the world's leader in<br />\nmotel construction and kidney transplants by running<br />\naway from a fight!<br />\nTo the question then: You say you're not ready for college. You're too green, too naive. You lack maturity.<br />\nOkay, the answer is simple: get mature. How? Well<br />\nsir, to achieve maturity you need two things:<br />\na) a probing mind;<br />\nb) a vest.<br />\nA probing mind will be quickly yours if you'll remember that education consists not of answers but of questions. Blindly accepting information and dumbly<br />\nmemorizing data is high school stuff. In college you don't<br />\njust accept. You dispute, you push, you pry, you challenge. If, for instance, your physics prof says,\"E equals<br />\nmc squared,\" don't just write it down. Say to the prof,<br />\n\"Why?\"<br />\nThis will show him two things:<br />\na) Your mind is a keen, thrusting instrument.<br />\nb) You are in the wrong major.<br />\nAsk questions, questions, and more questions. That is<br />\nthe essence of maturity, the heart and liver of education.<br />\nNothing will more quickly convince the teachers that you<br />\nare of college calibre. And the tougher your questions,<br />\nthe better. Come to class with queries that dart and flash,<br />\nthat make unexpected sallies into uncharted territory.<br />\nAsk things which have never been asked before, like<br />\n\"How tall was Nietzsche?\" and \"Did the Minotaur have<br />\nticks? If so, were they immortal?\" and \"How often did<br />\nPitt the Elder shave?\"<br />\n<br />\nSTAMP IT!<br />\nIT'S THE RAGE<br />\n<br />\nStand up and be counted<br />\nin Bass Weejuns!<br />\n<br />\nREGULAR<br />\nMODEL<br />\nANY $<br />\n<br />\n3 LINE TEXT<br />\nBe a big number on campus ... ask for Bass<br />\nWeejuns\u00ae moccasins at your nearby college store<br />\nor shoe shop.

Should you throw -up your<br />\nhands and quit? I say no! I say you must attack, grapple,<br />\ncope! I say America did not become the world's leader in<br />\nmotel construction and kidney transplants by running<br />\naway from a fight!<br />\nTo the question then: You say you're not ready for college. You're too green, too naive. You lack maturity.<br />\nOkay, the answer is simple: get mature. How? Well<br />\nsir, to achieve maturity you need two things:<br />\na) a probing mind;<br />\nb) a vest.<br />\nA probing mind will be quickly yours if you'll remember that education consists not of answers but of questions. Blindly accepting information and dumbly<br />\nmemorizing data is high school stuff. In college you don't<br />\njust accept. You dispute, you push, you pry, you challenge. If, for instance, your physics prof says,\"E equals<br />\nmc squared,\" don't just write it down. Say to the prof,<br />\n\"Why?\"<br />\nThis will show him two things:<br />\na) Your mind is a keen, thrusting instrument.<br />\nb) You are in the wrong major.<br />\nAsk questions, questions, and more questions. That is<br />\nthe essence of maturity, the heart and liver of education.<br />\nNothing will more quickly convince the teachers that you<br />\nare of college calibre. And the tougher your questions,<br />\nthe better. Come to class with queries that dart and flash,<br />\nthat make unexpected sallies into uncharted territory.<br />\nAsk things which have never been asked before, like<br />\n\"How tall was Nietzsche?\" and \"Did the Minotaur have<br />\nticks? If so, were they immortal?\" and \"How often did<br />\nPitt the Elder shave?\"<br /><br />\nSTAMP IT!<br />\nIT'S THE RAGE<br /><br />\nStand up and be counted<br />\nin Bass Weejuns!<br /><br />\nREGULAR<br />\nMODEL<br />\nANY $<br /><br />\n3 LINE TEXT<br />\nBe a big number on campus ... ask for Bass<br />\nWeejuns\u00ae moccasins at your nearby college store<br />\nor shoe shop.
