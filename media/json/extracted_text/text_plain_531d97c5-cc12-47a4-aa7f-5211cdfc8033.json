At Homewood, on Thursday, will be gathered a crowd of<br />\nbig business men from every State<br />\nin the union. It is up to us, we<br />\nwho are not lacrosse players, to<br />\nshow that Hopkins has got as<br />\nmuch college spirit as any college<br />\nin the country. We must so thoroughly \u2022 impress the name \"Hopkins\" on those advertising men that<br />\nthey shall never forget us.<br />\nOf course everybody is going to<br />\nthe game\u2014that goes without saying. There is to be a roped off<br />\nsection under the old pine tree.<br />\nAs the game is called at fourthirty, we should have the stand<br />\nfilled with Hopkins rooters by four<br />\no'clock, for fear the crowd will disregard our ropes, and fill the section.<br />\n\"Freddie\" Lee will be on hand, in<br />\nhis usual form. But is is up to<br />\nyou, you who know the cheers, to<br />\ncome up in :that section and YELL.<br />\nWe are champions of the Southern Division. Here's a long 'rah<br />\nwith a daisy on the end for the<br />\nInternational Championship!<br />\n1913's Achievements.<br />\n<br />\nThis year's graduating class is<br />\nmost to be commended for its<br />\npraiseworthy exertions in making<br />\nthe second annual Senior Week a<br />\nsuccess. Last year the novelty of<br />\ntheir doings made it easier for<br />\n1912 to get the necessary support<br />\nof the rest of the college. This<br />\nyear the task was more severe.<br />\nThat Chairman Richardson and his<br />\nsub-chairman have given us a most<br />\npleasurable week can best be<br />\nbrought out by a short summary<br />\nof the different festivities.<br />\nThe most frequently used phrase<br />\nin connection with the senior prom<br />\n<br />\nwas \"Best-ever.\" Everyone on<br />\nthe \"Annapolis\" wished the machinery had broken before we got<br />\nto Fort Howard, that we might<br />\nhave remained on the water hours<br />\nlonger. The field day and dinner<br />\nof Saturday will long remain a<br />\nbright spot in 1913's memories of<br />\nJohns Hopkins. The play this<br />\nafternoon was a giggle and a gasp<br />\nfrom curtain to curtain. In brief,<br />\nthe seniors so far surpassed the<br />\nSenior Week of last year that the<br />\nthree other classes are wondering<br />\nhow they are to maintain such a<br />\nrecord.<br />\nAnd the seniors have done more;<br />\nthey have revived an old tradition. After a lapse of four years<br />\nanother \"Hullabaloo\" has come before the public. The class of 1913,<br />\nand particularly the Board of Editors, deserves high commendation<br />\nfor the quality of their book. From<br />\ncover to cover it is cleverly gotten<br />\nup; the binding is very attractive,<br />\nand the interior ably fulfills the<br />\npromise of the outside.<br />\nManager Richardson wants everybody to buy their \"Hullabaloos\" before next Saturday. The increase<br />\ncrom $2.00 to $2.50 in the cost of<br />\nthe book has been made necessary<br />\nto clear expenses.<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \"Clothes.\"<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

The<br />\nacting was surely as good. Yes,<br />\nthe character sketching was keener,<br />\nthough this fact can only be appreciated by those who have studied<br />\n(under) the professors for three or<br />\nfour years.<br />\nOne fact was evident all the time<br />\nthe play was being given\u2014that<br />\nkindly feeling lay beneath all the<br />\nhumorous thrusts. At Princeton a<br />\nprofessor considers it a great honor<br />\nto have a song inserted in his honor<br />\nin the \"fac\" song, no matter how<br />\nhard the song hits him.<br />\nThe Princeton professors realize<br />\nthat boys are boys, and that they<br />\nmay sometimes show their affection<br />\nfor a \"prof\" by writing a song on<br />\nhim, or by knocking him in a class<br />\nplay. Boys respect and honor most<br />\nthe professors they make most fun<br />\nof. THE NEWS-LETTER thinks that<br />\nthe best way to establish that kindly,<br />\npersonal relationship between professors and students, which should<br />\ncertainly exist at Hopkins, is by the<br />\nproduction every year of such plays<br />\nas \"Who's Who?<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\n\u2014the Standard<br />\nof Style\u2014here<br />\nand abroad.<br />\n<br />\nis perhaps a very good reason why<br />\nTHERE<br />\nyou do not look as well-dressed as many<br />\nmen you admire.

At Homewood, on Thursday, will be gathered a crowd of<br />\nbig business men from every State<br />\nin the union. It is up to us, we<br />\nwho are not lacrosse players, to<br />\nshow that Hopkins has got as<br />\nmuch college spirit as any college<br />\nin the country. We must so thoroughly \u2022 impress the name \"Hopkins\" on those advertising men that<br />\nthey shall never forget us.<br />\nOf course everybody is going to<br />\nthe game\u2014that goes without saying. There is to be a roped off<br />\nsection under the old pine tree.<br />\nAs the game is called at fourthirty, we should have the stand<br />\nfilled with Hopkins rooters by four<br />\no'clock, for fear the crowd will disregard our ropes, and fill the section.<br />\n\"Freddie\" Lee will be on hand, in<br />\nhis usual form. But is is up to<br />\nyou, you who know the cheers, to<br />\ncome up in :that section and YELL.<br />\nWe are champions of the Southern Division. Here's a long 'rah<br />\nwith a daisy on the end for the<br />\nInternational Championship!<br />\n1913's Achievements.<br /><br />\nThis year's graduating class is<br />\nmost to be commended for its<br />\npraiseworthy exertions in making<br />\nthe second annual Senior Week a<br />\nsuccess. Last year the novelty of<br />\ntheir doings made it easier for<br />\n1912 to get the necessary support<br />\nof the rest of the college. This<br />\nyear the task was more severe.<br />\nThat Chairman Richardson and his<br />\nsub-chairman have given us a most<br />\npleasurable week can best be<br />\nbrought out by a short summary<br />\nof the different festivities.<br />\nThe most frequently used phrase<br />\nin connection with the senior prom<br /><br />\nwas \"Best-ever.\" Everyone on<br />\nthe \"Annapolis\" wished the machinery had broken before we got<br />\nto Fort Howard, that we might<br />\nhave remained on the water hours<br />\nlonger. The field day and dinner<br />\nof Saturday will long remain a<br />\nbright spot in 1913's memories of<br />\nJohns Hopkins. The play this<br />\nafternoon was a giggle and a gasp<br />\nfrom curtain to curtain. In brief,<br />\nthe seniors so far surpassed the<br />\nSenior Week of last year that the<br />\nthree other classes are wondering<br />\nhow they are to maintain such a<br />\nrecord.<br />\nAnd the seniors have done more;<br />\nthey have revived an old tradition. After a lapse of four years<br />\nanother \"Hullabaloo\" has come before the public. The class of 1913,<br />\nand particularly the Board of Editors, deserves high commendation<br />\nfor the quality of their book. From<br />\ncover to cover it is cleverly gotten<br />\nup; the binding is very attractive,<br />\nand the interior ably fulfills the<br />\npromise of the outside.<br />\nManager Richardson wants everybody to buy their \"Hullabaloos\" before next Saturday. The increase<br />\ncrom $2.00 to $2.50 in the cost of<br />\nthe book has been made necessary<br />\nto clear expenses.<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \"Clothes.\"<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br /><br />\nATTENTION!

We sympathize with<br />\nthe minority.<br /><br />\nfOWNES<br />\nLOVES<br /><br />\nThe Senior Play.<br /><br />\nWe hold it to be a self-evident<br />\ntruth thdt comparisons are odious.<br />\nTherefore, we shall not compare<br />\nthis year's senior play with the one<br />\ngiven last year, although it certainly<br />\nwas more ambitious; it was built<br />\naround a real plot, which, though<br />\nsimple, held the interest of every<br />\nhearer from beginning to end; and<br />\nthe staging was far better. The<br />\nacting was surely as good. Yes,<br />\nthe character sketching was keener,<br />\nthough this fact can only be appreciated by those who have studied<br />\n(under) the professors for three or<br />\nfour years.<br />\nOne fact was evident all the time<br />\nthe play was being given\u2014that<br />\nkindly feeling lay beneath all the<br />\nhumorous thrusts. At Princeton a<br />\nprofessor considers it a great honor<br />\nto have a song inserted in his honor<br />\nin the \"fac\" song, no matter how<br />\nhard the song hits him.<br />\nThe Princeton professors realize<br />\nthat boys are boys, and that they<br />\nmay sometimes show their affection<br />\nfor a \"prof\" by writing a song on<br />\nhim, or by knocking him in a class<br />\nplay. Boys respect and honor most<br />\nthe professors they make most fun<br />\nof. THE NEWS-LETTER thinks that<br />\nthe best way to establish that kindly,<br />\npersonal relationship between professors and students, which should<br />\ncertainly exist at Hopkins, is by the<br />\nproduction every year of such plays<br />\nas \"Who's Who?<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br /><br />\n\u2014the Standard<br />\nof Style\u2014here<br />\nand abroad.<br /><br />\nis perhaps a very good reason why<br />\nTHERE<br />\nyou do not look as well-dressed as many<br />\nmen you admire.
