We have time and again<br />\nentreated the youthful Raphael and Shakspere who likes to see his work in print to submit it<br />\nto us.

Corner, 3rd, has severed his connection<br />\nit rt<br />\nit<br />\n.<br />\nif<br />\nwith this paper, owing to the press of duties incident to his<br />\napproaching graduation. Mr. Corner did. more than kept his paper<br />\nIt<br />\non the high plane set for it by his predecessors. Although of a<br />\nretiring disposition, Mr. Corner is blessed with a real ''Spectator's\"<br />\neye, so that his editorials and articles were always upon some<br />\nIs i: is it it it ii<br />\npertinent subject, and always carried the force of conviction with<br />\nHe was a poet of no mean ability, and his humorous rymes<br />\nthem.<br />\n;zit it it<br />\nserved to enliven more than one otherwise dull page.<br />\nNor will his co-editors see him depart with equaminity. Despite the fact that his retirement means advancement for most of them, they feel that with his resignation the paper<br />\nhas lost a real producer\u2014a man who could be depended upon when the printer yelled for<br />\nmore copy,\" and they feel that now an added burden is upon their shoulders, which are but<br />\n1*;<br />\n<br />\nit lag it ug<br />\n<br />\npoorly capable of supporting such a weight.<br />\nUpon Mr. Corner's retirement, Mr. Hamilton Owens has become editor-in chief and<br />\nMr. Ross Veazy, assistant editor. Mr. N. Williams Haynes, '12, has been promoted to<br />\nathletic editor, vice Mr. Walter V. Johnson, resigned.<br />\n<br />\nWe print in this issue an article on Darwinism, by our Mr. Haynes. Such an article is<br />\nespecially apropos at this time, coming as it does right after the centenary of the great. Mr.<br />\nHaynes article is not in any sense technical, but treats the matter in a style calculated to make<br />\nthe dullest freshman understand what has heretofore been to most of us but a name.<br />\n<br />\nThe Class of 1910 has finally succeeded in getting together, and organizing. We<br />\nalways felt rather sorrow for that class, whose members never knew whether they were juniors<br />\nor sophomores. Now, however, we are inclined to envy them. A glance at the ticket elected<br />\nshows that every man got an office. Were we but a member, honor might have been heaped<br />\nupon us as well.<br />\nLooking over the ticket we cannot fail to be impressed with the literary value of the<br />\nclass. A poet is president, two other poets serve beneath him, and an orator sits at his right<br />\nhand. Look to your laurels, oh ye of 1909.<br />\n<br />\nThe doors leading from McCoy Hall to Monument street and Druid Hill avenue open<br />\ninwards. The law requires doors from all public halls to open outwards. This rule, we<br />\nunderstand, is technically obeyed by having the doors from the Assembly Hall into the<br />\ncorridor open outwards. This is no matter for technicalities! There is surely danger in the<br />\npresent system, even though that danger be small.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nDARWIN'S THEORY.<br />\nThe year 1809 saw the birth of many great<br />\nmen, and we in 1909 .have been celebrating<br />\nmany important centenaries. England honors<br />\nFitzgerald, Gladstone and Tennyson; Germany, Mendelssohn, and in this country the<br />\ncentenial anniversaries of the births of Holmes,<br />\nPoe and Lincoln are commemorated. All<br />\ncountries, however, have combined in doing<br />\nhomage to the memory of Charles Darwin.<br />\nDistinguished by impressive ceremonies and<br />\neulogies from the lips of statesmen, poets and<br />\nscientists, dozens of meetings in his praise<br />\nhave been held in every land, and in London,<br />\nBerlin, St. Petersburg, Paris and New York<br />\nstatues of him have been unveiled. Seldom,<br />\nif ever, has a man of science received such<br />\ngeneral recognition from the public, for<br />\nscientific heroes are not popular heroes, but<br />\n\"Darwin's work was such that it affected<br />\nmost human activity and all human thought.\"<br />\nThis is indeed the truth, for all branches of<br />\nscience, philosophy and religion have been<br />\naffected by evolution of Darwin's theory,<br />\nrevolutionized the natural sciences. It is the<br />\nfoundation of modern biological work; but it<br />\nalso opened up new vistas to the other<br />\nsciences. Philosophy, especially psychology,<br />\nowes much of its recent progress to evolution.<br />\nThe often talked of \"war between science<br />\nand religion\" is a direct outgrowth of Darwinism.<br />\nDarwin's theory is acknowledged by all<br />\nbiologists, who now wonder not so much at<br />\nevolution as at its tardy discovery. \"Evolution stares one in the face at every turn,\" but<br />\nthe world is full of doubting Thomases, and<br />\neven today there are some who do not believe<br />\nthat 'the Present is the child of the Past.\"<br />\nThe theory of evolution is simple. It<br />\ndenies the permanence of species, and says<br />\nthere is \"an answering change in all live<br />\nthings to meet a previous change in nature.\"<br />\nIn substance, Darwin said, \"Grant me three<br />\npoints, and I will prove evolution.\" In his<br />\n\"Origin of species\" he corroborated and<br />\ndemonstrated these points. The first is the<br />\nlaw of heredity, the second is the law of<br />\nvariation, the third is the struggle for existence in nature.<br />\nThe law of heredity is known to everyone.<br />\nA cat never has a litter of puppies. The<br />\n<br />\nyoung of bass are always bass. Hen's eggs<br />\ndo not hatch out into ducklings. \"No man<br />\ngathers figs from thistles.\" More than this,<br />\ntwo Persian cats will have Persian kittens;<br />\nblack bass eggs do not hatch Oswego bass, the<br />\nchicks from a pen of Plymouth-rocks will<br />\nwithout exception be Plymouth-rocks, sweet<br />\ncorn cannot be grown from field corn. Furthermore, cross-breds are a combination in<br />\nconformation, coloration, and instincts of<br />\ntheir parents, and, when fertile, will pass on<br />\nthese combined qualities to their offspring.<br />\nThis law of heredity is axiomatic, and it is<br />\nthe foundation of\u2022 all animal breeding. The<br />\nskillful breeders of today mate stock that<br />\nconforms most nearly to their ideal, and in<br />\ntime by always picking such specimens<br />\n(artifical selection) produce that ideal, or at<br />\nleast as near to it as is probably possible.<br />\nThe second law on which Darwin based his<br />\ntheory of evolution is that of variability. We<br />\nall know that we have never seen two people<br />\nwhom we could not distinguish. Even in the<br />\nstriking resemblance between some twins<br />\nthere are differences that are noticable to<br />\nthose who know them well. This variation<br />\nalso occurs in the lower animals and plants.<br />\nNo one has much trouble in picking out the<br />\nmembers of a Fox-terrier family, but in a litter<br />\nof Scottish-terriers, where there is little difference in marking, most people are at sea. To<br />\none with \"an eye for live stock,\" , however,<br />\nthey are quite as distinguishable as if they<br />\nwere all labeled. Two friends were out at<br />\nthe kennels with me one day trying to select<br />\na puppy I had promised them. Neither knew<br />\nanything about dogs, but one could pick out<br />\nanyone of the twenty odd puppies which had<br />\nattracted her, while the other could not tell<br />\none from the other. The kevelman, an old<br />\nScotchman, took me aside and said, \"The<br />\nwee lass ud mak' a rare joodge: she ken wha'<br />\nshe want, but she dinna ken wha' to want.\"<br />\nThis variation of external appearance is in all<br />\nliving things and can be carried down to the<br />\nminutest details. No two elephants are alike,<br />\nnor are the left antennae of any two crickets<br />\nidentical. This seems preposterous, but the<br />\nmicroscope shows it to be true.<br />\nVariation among animals and plants does<br />\nnot, however, stop with external appearances.<br />\nNo two skeltons of any species are identical.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nIn one this bone is thicker, that one longer,<br />\nand such radical variation as difference in the<br />\nnumber of vertebra or phalanges is found in<br />\nman. Roughly, we all appreciate variation,<br />\nbut few save the trained biologist realize how<br />\nwidespread the action of the law is. It has<br />\nbeen suggested, in fact, that the root of variation lies in the mysterious protoplasm of each<br />\nminute living cell. Certain it is that the<br />\nblood, muscle tissue, borne, and even the seed<br />\nof different individuals of the same species yield<br />\nmarkedly different results under chemical<br />\nanalysis.<br />\nThere is still another kind of variation.<br />\nOne Fox-hound, to use an example, is faster<br />\nthan a second, but cannot trail as well as a<br />\nthird, though he has a better 'tongue\" than<br />\neither and has more endurance than all the<br />\npack, but he is quite indifferent to petting.<br />\nAnimals differ, as we do, in their dispositions,<br />\nthe keenness of their senses, their ability to<br />\nwithstand heat and cold, hunger and thirst,<br />\ntheir swiftness, and physical endurance. The<br />\nlaw of variation, therefore, is both physiological, and it affects all parts of all organisms,<br />\nbut its action is not in any way uniform.<br />\nThe third principle upon which Darwin<br />\nbased his theory is the struggle for existence.<br />\nTo one strolling through the woods or across<br />\nthe meadows on a beautiful day `'when kindly<br />\nnature smiles on all,\" the idea of a fierce,<br />\nnever-ending life and death fight in all creation seems impossible. And yet such a fight<br />\nis always going on, and thousands die for the<br />\ntens that live. Unless we think, we do not<br />\nnotice it, for what has been called the balance<br />\nof nature has been established and swings<br />\ntrue. The number of individuals in a species<br />\nremains, under normal conditions, about constant. There are no great fluctuations, but a<br />\nterrible over-production of young is necessary<br />\nto maintain this ratio.<br />\nA few examples will make this clear. The<br />\ndecendants from a single pair of hop amphids,<br />\na small plant louse, would at the end of a<br />\nyear when none died number ten thousand<br />\nmillion million. Placed one after another<br />\nthese would make a line so long that light<br />\ntraveling about 200,000 miles a second<br />\nwould take two thousand nine hundred and<br />\nninety years to pass from one end to the other.<br />\nEach season the robin lays from one to three<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nclutches of from three to six eggs. Taking<br />\nfour as the average, which is surely a conservative estimate, at the end of ten years, if<br />\nthe original pair and all their young lived,<br />\nthere would be one hundred and eighteen<br />\nthousand and ninety-eight robins from the<br />\nfirst two. A common daisy, blooming as it<br />\ndoes for two months, will have about one<br />\nhundred and twenty-five blooms each of which<br />\nwill have about five hundred seeds, making a<br />\ntotal of sixty-two thousand five hundred seeds<br />\neach season from each plant.<br />\nThese figures show how many animals and<br />\nplants die to keep the balance of nature true.<br />\nThe results when the balance is destroyed are<br />\nappaling. Everyone thought the rabbit a<br />\nharmless little creature when he was first imported into Australia, but now the Government there spends more money to keep down<br />\nthe rabbits than for all other items. on its<br />\nbudget. The mongoose was brought from<br />\nIndia to Jamaica to kill off the numerous<br />\nsnakes, for he lives on snake eggs. He has<br />\nexterminated not only the snakes, but also<br />\nthe birds, and is now a scourge. Any animal<br />\nout of its natut-al environment will either be<br />\nkilled off or will break bounds, for he disturbs<br />\nthe balance.<br />\nThe practical application of these three<br />\nlaws to evolution is by means of the survival<br />\nof the fittest, or natural selection, as Darwin<br />\ncalls it. Let us take a hypothetical case.<br />\nThe climate in a certain district is cooled<br />\ngradually, and a new phaze in the struggle<br />\nfor existence faces the life of the region.<br />\nThose individuals which by variation are best<br />\nable to withstand cold live and by the law of<br />\nheredity their offspring inherit this quality,<br />\npassing it on indefinately as the weather keeps<br />\non becoming more rigorous. Or again, a<br />\ncertain bird preys on a certain insect, which<br />\nlives say on the underside of oak leaves.<br />\nThose of the insect which look even infinitesmally more like the lower side of oak leaves<br />\nstand just so much better chance of escaping<br />\ndestruction. For ages this goes on till at last<br />\nan insect with highly specialized protective<br />\ncoloration is developed. It is not hard to see,<br />\nwith the complexity of enemies that each live<br />\nthing has and the great difference in conditions of life in different localities, that an<br />\nanswering change in the organism to meet a<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nprevious change in nature might make species.<br />\nIn this short sketch I have not found it<br />\npossible to do more than touch most lightly<br />\non the fundamentals of Darwin's theory, nor<br />\nhave I been able to take up such important<br />\nconsiderations as \"use and disuse,\" \"mutation,\" and hybid fertility. As for the proofs<br />\nof evolution\u2014and there are many in bonmlogies and embryonic recapitulation\u2014I have<br />\nbeen able to give none. I trust, however,<br />\nthat I have been able to make clear that Darwin's theory of evolution is far more than<br />\n\"the scientific dream of an atheistic mad<br />\nman,\" as a doctor of theology called \"The<br />\nOrigin of Species.\"<br />\nH., '12.<br />\n<br />\nAN OUT-DOOR SCENE.<br />\nFrom a certain window in the Classical<br />\nLibrary one looks out upon Monument street,<br />\nand, \"in particular,\" upon two red brick<br />\nbuildings, the lighter in color being at the<br />\ntop of the hill. It is not a cheerful view,<br />\nespecially on a warm spring morning, with<br />\nthe sun shining happily away, and the dreary<br />\ndust of old leather-bound copies of Aristotle<br />\nand other ancient heroes for the moment forgotten. The building that is lighter in color<br />\nis the Quaker Meeting House. But then it is<br />\nnot Sunday, and there are no Quakeresses in<br />\nsight. With its tall, strangely built windows<br />\nthe place looks too much like a factory building, and you turn away to the other 'temple,\"<br />\nmore fair to look upon.

The season's work was begun<br />\nearly with little hope of great success, as<br />\nseven men of our crack '98 team had left the<br />\nUniversity leaving as many vacancies to be<br />\nfilled by new men. History tells us that<br />\n.there was a large number of candidates on<br />\nhand, but they were all green. Although<br />\ngraduation had taken seven men from us, it<br />\nwas yet kind in leaving us our big five. They<br />\nwere: Maddren, McInnes, C. Guggenheimer,<br />\nFitzgerald and R. T. Abercrombie. Also<br />\nupon close analysis we find that Guggenheimer played goal, in that year the greatest<br />\ngoal-keeper in the United States; at cover<br />\npoint we have \"Billy\" Maddren the old war<br />\nhorse and coach of the team. Then we skip<br />\nthree places only to meet Abercrombie at<br />\ncentre, who got to be known in the. Lacrosse<br />\nworld as the \"Hopkins Centre\" playing this<br />\nposition for five successive years. Next to<br />\nhim we locate Tom Fitzgerald at third attack<br />\nwhom we can best describe with these seven<br />\nwords: tall, speedy, nervy, heady and a<br />\ndodger. On account of this last characteristic the writer has never seen Fitzgerald come<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nout of a lacrosse game without a good assortment of court plaster all over his face. He<br />\nwas when necessary, a fine individual player.<br />\nAgain we skip three places only to shake<br />\nhands with our great and only \"Cannuck.\"<br />\n\"Mac\"\u2014he in mind of those who ought to<br />\nknow\u2014is considered up-to-date the greatest<br />\nin home Hopkins has ever had. We have had<br />\nquicker shots but for the all around man who<br />\nhas endurance, speed when necessary, stickwork, dodging ability and head-work, McInnes stands alone. Such men were the five<br />\nlone men that graduation left us and just in<br />\nthose positions where they were of most value<br />\nto the team. It was this combination of old<br />\nmen that gave the team a balance. The new<br />\nmen filled in the other places being sandwitched in between the old stock. Of these<br />\nRobert H. Grimes at first attack was the surprise of the season, his goal shooting was<br />\ngood.<br />\nAfter months of faithful training by Maddren, the team started its season by beating<br />\nColumbia in New York City by a score of 8<br />\nto I. The game showed up nothing of particular interest except that Columbia also<br />\nknew that McInnes was a dangerous attack<br />\nman. They did not know him by sight but<br />\nby reputation and started in to cover up our<br />\nout home Preston, (who played the first and<br />\nonly game in his life that day) believing him<br />\nto be \"Mac.\" This mistake on their part was<br />\nbrought about by the usual foresight of our<br />\ncoach who had suggested that \"Mac\" and<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nPreston change names for the occasion.<br />\nNext Harvard was played to a standstill to<br />\nthe tune of 20 to 0. The game was uninteresting as can be readily inferred from the<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe real test of the season came when the<br />\n\"Black and Blue\" lined up against the Crescent Athletic Club of Brooklyn at Electric<br />\nPark. This was the first time that your historian was introduced to these brilliant players, and to confess the truth thought they<br />\nwere entirely too stout and old to do any fast<br />\nwork and deducted the illogical result that<br />\nthey would be \"easy meat\" for our boys.<br />\nThe game began and it might be mentioned<br />\nin passing that Billy Hodges, one of our '98<br />\nteam men, did most of the mid field running<br />\nfor Crescents that day. After a very hotly<br />\ncontested game, and good work all around,<br />\nespecially by Guggenheimer, the game ended<br />\nin favor of the New Yorkers by a score of<br />\n5 to 2.<br />\nWhen it came to the Championship Games,<br />\nStevens was beaten by the score of 12 to 5, yet<br />\nit was a hard fought game between two strong<br />\nattacks as can be seen by the fact that five<br />\ngoals were scored on our goal man.<br />\nA week later the team started for Lehigh,<br />\nit would be more accurate to say part of it,<br />\nbecause when the train pulled out of the<br />\nstation Bandel, our dear \"Jay,\" was found<br />\nwanting. Suffice it to say that the lost freshman arrived in South Bethlehem in time to<br />\ndon his lacrosse costume and go in the game.<br />\nFor a detailed account of the side issues of<br />\nthis trip I respectfully refer to the Hullabaloo<br />\nof 1900 which says: -Everything depended<br />\non this game; and twenty-four hours before<br />\nthe battle nervousness was a characteristic not<br />\nonly of the players, but of the little party of<br />\nrooters who accompanied the team to South<br />\nBethlehem. This nervousness took at times<br />\na curious shape. The \"Colonel\"(Crenshaw)<br />\nrecounted time and again the remarkable<br />\nstory of \"Billy White,\" and Campbell bought<br />\none peck of oranges at the early hour of 1 A.<br />\nM., with apparently no other purpose than to<br />\nthrow them through windows. Amid the<br />\ncrash of falling glass, the 'Colonel\" started off<br />\nonce more: \"Well, let me tell you. Two or<br />\nthree Lehigh men and Billy\u2014.\" but Campbell jammed his last orange down the \"Colo-<br />\n<br />\nnel's\" throat and he choked on the word<br />\n''White.'<br />\n\"Two or three of our more curious members tried to discover the workings of the fire<br />\nescape, and whether it was effective in lowering bed-room china as human carcasses. It<br />\nproved to be quite as efficient, only the crockery broke. However, that was the manager's<br />\nbusiness. Few were the hours of sleep that<br />\nnight, and on the morrow the great battle!\"<br />\n'`During the first few minutes of the game'<br />\nsays the Hullabaloo, \"uncertainty prevailed,<br />\nbut soon the fellows warmed to, and the rest,<br />\nwell, in little more than an hour we were<br />\nagain champions.\" Score, 11 to 3.<br />\nCaptain Fitzgerald's team lined up as follows:<br />\nC.

Soon all are passed and as the despatcher calls \"All abroad\" Rudolph pushes<br />\nthe tickets into one of his pockets and enters<br />\nthe train.

What's the<br />\nmatter ``Lindy\" comes the query? Next we<br />\nhear a five minutes' laugh from \"Berny\" and<br />\nthen the following: \"I'll bet you a bottle of<br />\nchampagne that those tickets are in your<br />\npocket.\" The manager: \"I'll take you up.\"<br />\nThen everybody crowds around as Bernheim<br />\nbegins his hunt for that bottle. One pocket:<br />\nno result; pocket number two: a dig behind<br />\nthe label\u2014the tickets, and \"Bert\" wins amid<br />\nthe shouts of the crowd assembled.<br />\nNow as to the game with Stevens: We<br />\nstarted in with a rush, but Stevens drew first<br />\nblood by scoring almost immediately. Then<br />\n<br />\nour boys steadied down, however, and before<br />\nvery long the Bandel Brothers, especially<br />\nBernard who was in good trim that !day, shot<br />\na few goals, while McInnes walked up and<br />\ndown the crease and mixed it up with his old<br />\nfriend Layat, Stevens goal tend. By the<br />\ntime the second half was reached our light<br />\nattack on account of very rough playing, was<br />\npretty well used up. \"Jay\" Bandel was all<br />\nin and the burden of the midfield work fell on<br />\nNorton and Abercrombie. Luck also seemed<br />\nto be against us and \"Al\" Bruton sprained<br />\nhis ankle but kept on in the game. To cap<br />\nthe climax, Maddren was put out of the game<br />\nfor five minutes for rough playing and our<br />\nboys were forced to keep on with ten men as<br />\nBruton could not be depended on. The<br />\nminute our coach was put out, Stevens<br />\nstarted in with a terrific rush while Captain<br />\nAbercrombie called \"Mac\" back to play cover<br />\npoint. Now the score stood four to three in<br />\nfavor of Hopkins and it was only bad generalship on the part of our opponents that saved<br />\nthe game for us at this same score.

We have time and again<br />\nentreated the youthful Raphael and Shakspere who likes to see his work in print to submit it<br />\nto us. And still we find it necessary to hunt for subjects on which to write to fill up our bimonthly issues.

Corner, 3rd, has severed his connection<br />\nit rt<br />\nit<br />\n.<br />\nif<br />\nwith this paper, owing to the press of duties incident to his<br />\napproaching graduation. Mr. Corner did. more than kept his paper<br />\nIt<br />\non the high plane set for it by his predecessors. Although of a<br />\nretiring disposition, Mr. Corner is blessed with a real ''Spectator's\"<br />\neye, so that his editorials and articles were always upon some<br />\nIs i: is it it it ii<br />\npertinent subject, and always carried the force of conviction with<br />\nHe was a poet of no mean ability, and his humorous rymes<br />\nthem.<br />\n;zit it it<br />\nserved to enliven more than one otherwise dull page.<br />\nNor will his co-editors see him depart with equaminity. Despite the fact that his retirement means advancement for most of them, they feel that with his resignation the paper<br />\nhas lost a real producer\u2014a man who could be depended upon when the printer yelled for<br />\nmore copy,\" and they feel that now an added burden is upon their shoulders, which are but<br />\n1*;<br /><br />\nit lag it ug<br /><br />\npoorly capable of supporting such a weight.<br />\nUpon Mr. Corner's retirement, Mr. Hamilton Owens has become editor-in chief and<br />\nMr. Ross Veazy, assistant editor. Mr. N. Williams Haynes, '12, has been promoted to<br />\nathletic editor, vice Mr. Walter V. Johnson, resigned.<br /><br />\nWe print in this issue an article on Darwinism, by our Mr. Haynes. Such an article is<br />\nespecially apropos at this time, coming as it does right after the centenary of the great. Mr.<br />\nHaynes article is not in any sense technical, but treats the matter in a style calculated to make<br />\nthe dullest freshman understand what has heretofore been to most of us but a name.<br /><br />\nThe Class of 1910 has finally succeeded in getting together, and organizing. We<br />\nalways felt rather sorrow for that class, whose members never knew whether they were juniors<br />\nor sophomores. Now, however, we are inclined to envy them. A glance at the ticket elected<br />\nshows that every man got an office. Were we but a member, honor might have been heaped<br />\nupon us as well.<br />\nLooking over the ticket we cannot fail to be impressed with the literary value of the<br />\nclass. A poet is president, two other poets serve beneath him, and an orator sits at his right<br />\nhand. Look to your laurels, oh ye of 1909.<br /><br />\nThe doors leading from McCoy Hall to Monument street and Druid Hill avenue open<br />\ninwards. The law requires doors from all public halls to open outwards. This rule, we<br />\nunderstand, is technically obeyed by having the doors from the Assembly Hall into the<br />\ncorridor open outwards. This is no matter for technicalities! There is surely danger in the<br />\npresent system, even though that danger be small.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nDARWIN'S THEORY.<br />\nThe year 1809 saw the birth of many great<br />\nmen, and we in 1909 .have been celebrating<br />\nmany important centenaries. England honors<br />\nFitzgerald, Gladstone and Tennyson; Germany, Mendelssohn, and in this country the<br />\ncentenial anniversaries of the births of Holmes,<br />\nPoe and Lincoln are commemorated. All<br />\ncountries, however, have combined in doing<br />\nhomage to the memory of Charles Darwin.<br />\nDistinguished by impressive ceremonies and<br />\neulogies from the lips of statesmen, poets and<br />\nscientists, dozens of meetings in his praise<br />\nhave been held in every land, and in London,<br />\nBerlin, St. Petersburg, Paris and New York<br />\nstatues of him have been unveiled. Seldom,<br />\nif ever, has a man of science received such<br />\ngeneral recognition from the public, for<br />\nscientific heroes are not popular heroes, but<br />\n\"Darwin's work was such that it affected<br />\nmost human activity and all human thought.\"<br />\nThis is indeed the truth, for all branches of<br />\nscience, philosophy and religion have been<br />\naffected by evolution of Darwin's theory,<br />\nrevolutionized the natural sciences. It is the<br />\nfoundation of modern biological work; but it<br />\nalso opened up new vistas to the other<br />\nsciences. Philosophy, especially psychology,<br />\nowes much of its recent progress to evolution.<br />\nThe often talked of \"war between science<br />\nand religion\" is a direct outgrowth of Darwinism.<br />\nDarwin's theory is acknowledged by all<br />\nbiologists, who now wonder not so much at<br />\nevolution as at its tardy discovery. \"Evolution stares one in the face at every turn,\" but<br />\nthe world is full of doubting Thomases, and<br />\neven today there are some who do not believe<br />\nthat 'the Present is the child of the Past.\"<br />\nThe theory of evolution is simple. It<br />\ndenies the permanence of species, and says<br />\nthere is \"an answering change in all live<br />\nthings to meet a previous change in nature.\"<br />\nIn substance, Darwin said, \"Grant me three<br />\npoints, and I will prove evolution.\" In his<br />\n\"Origin of species\" he corroborated and<br />\ndemonstrated these points. The first is the<br />\nlaw of heredity, the second is the law of<br />\nvariation, the third is the struggle for existence in nature.<br />\nThe law of heredity is known to everyone.<br />\nA cat never has a litter of puppies. The<br /><br />\nyoung of bass are always bass. Hen's eggs<br />\ndo not hatch out into ducklings. \"No man<br />\ngathers figs from thistles.\" More than this,<br />\ntwo Persian cats will have Persian kittens;<br />\nblack bass eggs do not hatch Oswego bass, the<br />\nchicks from a pen of Plymouth-rocks will<br />\nwithout exception be Plymouth-rocks, sweet<br />\ncorn cannot be grown from field corn. Furthermore, cross-breds are a combination in<br />\nconformation, coloration, and instincts of<br />\ntheir parents, and, when fertile, will pass on<br />\nthese combined qualities to their offspring.<br />\nThis law of heredity is axiomatic, and it is<br />\nthe foundation of\u2022 all animal breeding. The<br />\nskillful breeders of today mate stock that<br />\nconforms most nearly to their ideal, and in<br />\ntime by always picking such specimens<br />\n(artifical selection) produce that ideal, or at<br />\nleast as near to it as is probably possible.<br />\nThe second law on which Darwin based his<br />\ntheory of evolution is that of variability. We<br />\nall know that we have never seen two people<br />\nwhom we could not distinguish. Even in the<br />\nstriking resemblance between some twins<br />\nthere are differences that are noticable to<br />\nthose who know them well. This variation<br />\nalso occurs in the lower animals and plants.<br />\nNo one has much trouble in picking out the<br />\nmembers of a Fox-terrier family, but in a litter<br />\nof Scottish-terriers, where there is little difference in marking, most people are at sea. To<br />\none with \"an eye for live stock,\" , however,<br />\nthey are quite as distinguishable as if they<br />\nwere all labeled. Two friends were out at<br />\nthe kennels with me one day trying to select<br />\na puppy I had promised them. Neither knew<br />\nanything about dogs, but one could pick out<br />\nanyone of the twenty odd puppies which had<br />\nattracted her, while the other could not tell<br />\none from the other. The kevelman, an old<br />\nScotchman, took me aside and said, \"The<br />\nwee lass ud mak' a rare joodge: she ken wha'<br />\nshe want, but she dinna ken wha' to want.\"<br />\nThis variation of external appearance is in all<br />\nliving things and can be carried down to the<br />\nminutest details. No two elephants are alike,<br />\nnor are the left antennae of any two crickets<br />\nidentical. This seems preposterous, but the<br />\nmicroscope shows it to be true.<br />\nVariation among animals and plants does<br />\nnot, however, stop with external appearances.<br />\nNo two skeltons of any species are identical.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nIn one this bone is thicker, that one longer,<br />\nand such radical variation as difference in the<br />\nnumber of vertebra or phalanges is found in<br />\nman. Roughly, we all appreciate variation,<br />\nbut few save the trained biologist realize how<br />\nwidespread the action of the law is. It has<br />\nbeen suggested, in fact, that the root of variation lies in the mysterious protoplasm of each<br />\nminute living cell. Certain it is that the<br />\nblood, muscle tissue, borne, and even the seed<br />\nof different individuals of the same species yield<br />\nmarkedly different results under chemical<br />\nanalysis.<br />\nThere is still another kind of variation.<br />\nOne Fox-hound, to use an example, is faster<br />\nthan a second, but cannot trail as well as a<br />\nthird, though he has a better 'tongue\" than<br />\neither and has more endurance than all the<br />\npack, but he is quite indifferent to petting.<br />\nAnimals differ, as we do, in their dispositions,<br />\nthe keenness of their senses, their ability to<br />\nwithstand heat and cold, hunger and thirst,<br />\ntheir swiftness, and physical endurance. The<br />\nlaw of variation, therefore, is both physiological, and it affects all parts of all organisms,<br />\nbut its action is not in any way uniform.<br />\nThe third principle upon which Darwin<br />\nbased his theory is the struggle for existence.<br />\nTo one strolling through the woods or across<br />\nthe meadows on a beautiful day `'when kindly<br />\nnature smiles on all,\" the idea of a fierce,<br />\nnever-ending life and death fight in all creation seems impossible. And yet such a fight<br />\nis always going on, and thousands die for the<br />\ntens that live. Unless we think, we do not<br />\nnotice it, for what has been called the balance<br />\nof nature has been established and swings<br />\ntrue. The number of individuals in a species<br />\nremains, under normal conditions, about constant. There are no great fluctuations, but a<br />\nterrible over-production of young is necessary<br />\nto maintain this ratio.<br />\nA few examples will make this clear. The<br />\ndecendants from a single pair of hop amphids,<br />\na small plant louse, would at the end of a<br />\nyear when none died number ten thousand<br />\nmillion million. Placed one after another<br />\nthese would make a line so long that light<br />\ntraveling about 200,000 miles a second<br />\nwould take two thousand nine hundred and<br />\nninety years to pass from one end to the other.<br />\nEach season the robin lays from one to three<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nclutches of from three to six eggs. Taking<br />\nfour as the average, which is surely a conservative estimate, at the end of ten years, if<br />\nthe original pair and all their young lived,<br />\nthere would be one hundred and eighteen<br />\nthousand and ninety-eight robins from the<br />\nfirst two. A common daisy, blooming as it<br />\ndoes for two months, will have about one<br />\nhundred and twenty-five blooms each of which<br />\nwill have about five hundred seeds, making a<br />\ntotal of sixty-two thousand five hundred seeds<br />\neach season from each plant.<br />\nThese figures show how many animals and<br />\nplants die to keep the balance of nature true.<br />\nThe results when the balance is destroyed are<br />\nappaling. Everyone thought the rabbit a<br />\nharmless little creature when he was first imported into Australia, but now the Government there spends more money to keep down<br />\nthe rabbits than for all other items. on its<br />\nbudget. The mongoose was brought from<br />\nIndia to Jamaica to kill off the numerous<br />\nsnakes, for he lives on snake eggs. He has<br />\nexterminated not only the snakes, but also<br />\nthe birds, and is now a scourge. Any animal<br />\nout of its natut-al environment will either be<br />\nkilled off or will break bounds, for he disturbs<br />\nthe balance.<br />\nThe practical application of these three<br />\nlaws to evolution is by means of the survival<br />\nof the fittest, or natural selection, as Darwin<br />\ncalls it. Let us take a hypothetical case.<br />\nThe climate in a certain district is cooled<br />\ngradually, and a new phaze in the struggle<br />\nfor existence faces the life of the region.<br />\nThose individuals which by variation are best<br />\nable to withstand cold live and by the law of<br />\nheredity their offspring inherit this quality,<br />\npassing it on indefinately as the weather keeps<br />\non becoming more rigorous.

The season's work was begun<br />\nearly with little hope of great success, as<br />\nseven men of our crack '98 team had left the<br />\nUniversity leaving as many vacancies to be<br />\nfilled by new men. History tells us that<br />\n.there was a large number of candidates on<br />\nhand, but they were all green. Although<br />\ngraduation had taken seven men from us, it<br />\nwas yet kind in leaving us our big five. They<br />\nwere: Maddren, McInnes, C. Guggenheimer,<br />\nFitzgerald and R. T. Abercrombie. Also<br />\nupon close analysis we find that Guggenheimer played goal, in that year the greatest<br />\ngoal-keeper in the United States; at cover<br />\npoint we have \"Billy\" Maddren the old war<br />\nhorse and coach of the team. Then we skip<br />\nthree places only to meet Abercrombie at<br />\ncentre, who got to be known in the. Lacrosse<br />\nworld as the \"Hopkins Centre\" playing this<br />\nposition for five successive years. Next to<br />\nhim we locate Tom Fitzgerald at third attack<br />\nwhom we can best describe with these seven<br />\nwords: tall, speedy, nervy, heady and a<br />\ndodger. On account of this last characteristic the writer has never seen Fitzgerald come<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nout of a lacrosse game without a good assortment of court plaster all over his face. He<br />\nwas when necessary, a fine individual player.<br />\nAgain we skip three places only to shake<br />\nhands with our great and only \"Cannuck.\"<br />\n\"Mac\"\u2014he in mind of those who ought to<br />\nknow\u2014is considered up-to-date the greatest<br />\nin home Hopkins has ever had. We have had<br />\nquicker shots but for the all around man who<br />\nhas endurance, speed when necessary, stickwork, dodging ability and head-work, McInnes stands alone. Such men were the five<br />\nlone men that graduation left us and just in<br />\nthose positions where they were of most value<br />\nto the team. It was this combination of old<br />\nmen that gave the team a balance. The new<br />\nmen filled in the other places being sandwitched in between the old stock. Of these<br />\nRobert H. Grimes at first attack was the surprise of the season, his goal shooting was<br />\ngood.<br />\nAfter months of faithful training by Maddren, the team started its season by beating<br />\nColumbia in New York City by a score of 8<br />\nto I. The game showed up nothing of particular interest except that Columbia also<br />\nknew that McInnes was a dangerous attack<br />\nman. They did not know him by sight but<br />\nby reputation and started in to cover up our<br />\nout home Preston, (who played the first and<br />\nonly game in his life that day) believing him<br />\nto be \"Mac.\" This mistake on their part was<br />\nbrought about by the usual foresight of our<br />\ncoach who had suggested that \"Mac\" and<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nPreston change names for the occasion.<br />\nNext Harvard was played to a standstill to<br />\nthe tune of 20 to 0. The game was uninteresting as can be readily inferred from the<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe real test of the season came when the<br />\n\"Black and Blue\" lined up against the Crescent Athletic Club of Brooklyn at Electric<br />\nPark. This was the first time that your historian was introduced to these brilliant players, and to confess the truth thought they<br />\nwere entirely too stout and old to do any fast<br />\nwork and deducted the illogical result that<br />\nthey would be \"easy meat\" for our boys.<br />\nThe game began and it might be mentioned<br />\nin passing that Billy Hodges, one of our '98<br />\nteam men, did most of the mid field running<br />\nfor Crescents that day. After a very hotly<br />\ncontested game, and good work all around,<br />\nespecially by Guggenheimer, the game ended<br />\nin favor of the New Yorkers by a score of<br />\n5 to 2.<br />\nWhen it came to the Championship Games,<br />\nStevens was beaten by the score of 12 to 5, yet<br />\nit was a hard fought game between two strong<br />\nattacks as can be seen by the fact that five<br />\ngoals were scored on our goal man.<br />\nA week later the team started for Lehigh,<br />\nit would be more accurate to say part of it,<br />\nbecause when the train pulled out of the<br />\nstation Bandel, our dear \"Jay,\" was found<br />\nwanting. Suffice it to say that the lost freshman arrived in South Bethlehem in time to<br />\ndon his lacrosse costume and go in the game.<br />\nFor a detailed account of the side issues of<br />\nthis trip I respectfully refer to the Hullabaloo<br />\nof 1900 which says: -Everything depended<br />\non this game; and twenty-four hours before<br />\nthe battle nervousness was a characteristic not<br />\nonly of the players, but of the little party of<br />\nrooters who accompanied the team to South<br />\nBethlehem. This nervousness took at times<br />\na curious shape. The \"Colonel\"(Crenshaw)<br />\nrecounted time and again the remarkable<br />\nstory of \"Billy White,\" and Campbell bought<br />\none peck of oranges at the early hour of 1 A.<br />\nM., with apparently no other purpose than to<br />\nthrow them through windows. Amid the<br />\ncrash of falling glass, the 'Colonel\" started off<br />\nonce more: \"Well, let me tell you. Two or<br />\nthree Lehigh men and Billy\u2014.\" but Campbell jammed his last orange down the \"Colo-<br /><br />\nnel's\" throat and he choked on the word<br />\n''White.'<br />\n\"Two or three of our more curious members tried to discover the workings of the fire<br />\nescape, and whether it was effective in lowering bed-room china as human carcasses. It<br />\nproved to be quite as efficient, only the crockery broke. However, that was the manager's<br />\nbusiness.

Soon all are passed and as the despatcher calls \"All abroad\" Rudolph pushes<br />\nthe tickets into one of his pockets and enters<br />\nthe train.

What's the<br />\nmatter ``Lindy\" comes the query? Next we<br />\nhear a five minutes' laugh from \"Berny\" and<br />\nthen the following: \"I'll bet you a bottle of<br />\nchampagne that those tickets are in your<br />\npocket.\" The manager: \"I'll take you up.\"<br />\nThen everybody crowds around as Bernheim<br />\nbegins his hunt for that bottle. One pocket:<br />\nno result; pocket number two: a dig behind<br />\nthe label\u2014the tickets, and \"Bert\" wins amid<br />\nthe shouts of the crowd assembled.<br />\nNow as to the game with Stevens: We<br />\nstarted in with a rush, but Stevens drew first<br />\nblood by scoring almost immediately. Then<br /><br />\nour boys steadied down, however, and before<br />\nvery long the Bandel Brothers, especially<br />\nBernard who was in good trim that !day, shot<br />\na few goals, while McInnes walked up and<br />\ndown the crease and mixed it up with his old<br />\nfriend Layat, Stevens goal tend. By the<br />\ntime the second half was reached our light<br />\nattack on account of very rough playing, was<br />\npretty well used up. \"Jay\" Bandel was all<br />\nin and the burden of the midfield work fell on<br />\nNorton and Abercrombie. Luck also seemed<br />\nto be against us and \"Al\" Bruton sprained<br />\nhis ankle but kept on in the game. To cap<br />\nthe climax, Maddren was put out of the game<br />\nfor five minutes for rough playing and our<br />\nboys were forced to keep on with ten men as<br />\nBruton could not be depended on. The<br />\nminute our coach was put out, Stevens<br />\nstarted in with a terrific rush while Captain<br />\nAbercrombie called \"Mac\" back to play cover<br />\npoint. Now the score stood four to three in<br />\nfavor of Hopkins and it was only bad generalship on the part of our opponents that saved<br />\nthe game for us at this same score.
