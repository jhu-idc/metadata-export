For the purposes of<br />\nthis article the reader may assume,<br />\nif it will make him feel any better,<br />\nthat the R. o. T. c. is a perfect<br />\nmachine for preparation for war;<br />\nor he may agree with me, whichever he prefers.<br />\nI think I am safe in saying that<br />\none factor of all civilization and<br />\nmost particularly during the past<br />\nfifteen years, has been a striving<br />\nafter world peace and the general<br />\noutlawry of war. Always there<br />\nhave been a few struggling pacifists<br />\nto make speeches and write pamphlets; but the majority has simply<br />\nsaid, ''War is inevitable. It would<br />\nbe fine to stop it, but, of course,<br />\nthat is just a pipe dream.\" If I had<br />\nbeen living forty years ago I believe<br />\nI would have agreed with the latter.<br />\nHowever, there exists today a<br />\nweapon in the hands of the truly<br />\ncivilized throughout the world, a<br />\nweapon which not only makes the<br />\nabolition of war possible, but makes<br />\nit inevitable, sometime in the future;<br />\nif--it is used properly. This<br />\nweapon, the most powerful ever in<br />\nthe hands of man, more permeating<br />\nthan big guns, airplanes, and bombs<br />\n-is education. Probably more good<br />\nhas been done by a systematic<br />\nscheme of education in the past one<br />\nhundred years than by any other six<br />\nthings the world has ever known.<br />\nYet there is one thing which it has<br />\nnot accomplished, but which it is<br />\nrapidly coming to, the outlawry of<br />\nwar, completely and irretrievably.<br />\nTHE Johns Hopkins University<br />\nis one of the most highly enlightened institutions of this modern<br />\nsystem of teaching and learning.<br />\nInstead of leading the way for<br />\nother schools as she has so often<br />\ndone before, a unit of the R. 0. T.<br />\nC. exists and thrives at Hopkins.<br />\nThere has been a widely and rapidly spreading movement throughout<br />\nthe country to not only abolish compulsory military training, but also<br />\nto remove military units completely<br />\nfrom the campuses of our civilian<br />\ncolleges. Successful leaders of this<br />\nnew pacifist movement must come<br />\nfrom our schools of higher education ; and we can hardly expect<br />\nthem to come from among the<br />\nmembers of the Officers' Reserve<br />\nCorps! Thus it is imperative that<br />\nmilitary units be abolished from our<br />\ncolleges, and Hopkins along with<br />\nothers of the better universities<br />\nmust lead the way to this end.<br />\nThe young man coming to college<br />\nis at the most gullible and susceptible age. In selecting his course he<br />\nreads in the five pages of the<br />\ncatalogue devoted to the R. 0. T.<br />\nC., that a unit of the R. 0. T. C.<br />\nexists on our campus, as it does in<br />\n\"practically all of the important colleges and universities of the<br />\ncountry.\" Also he le~rns that, \"of<br />\nthe 125 hours credit required for<br />\ngraduation, 17 may be earned in<br />\nthis department-.\" The R. 0 . T . C.<br />\npupil is also paid 30 cents a day for<br />\n\"rations\" during his last two years,<br />\nwhich totals to nearly 100 doflars a<br />\nyear. Besides all this there is a<br />\nsnappy uniform provided for him,<br />\nand the possibility of a commission<br />\nin the Officers' Reserve Corps. The<br />\nschedule of his R. 0. T. C. courses<br />\nis arranged so as to fit in with the<br />\nrest of his subjects. He learns that<br />\nthe courses are generally not difficult, and by the time his parents<br />\nhave read the R. 0. T. C. section<br />\nof the catalogue he finds himself<br />\nirretrievably contracted to two years<br />\nof military training. Of course it's<br />\nnot compulsory; but it's almost unavoidable.<br />\n<br />\n\"barbarous\" passages, those applying to real warfare, been expurgated fro~ his manual? Is he trained<br />\nin bayonet fighting? Is he told that<br />\nthe more savage, the less educated a<br />\nman is, the better soldier he will<br />\nmake? Arlington Conway says that<br />\nduring the last war the most effective troops came from the least<br />\ncivilized portions of the world; and<br />\nthat the German soldier suffered<br />\nterribly from too much learning.<br />\nHe also tells of one of the best<br />\ntrainers of troops during the war,<br />\nlecturing young men until they had<br />\nlost all remnants of civilization and<br />\nthen turning them loose with<br />\nbayonets on dummys dressed as<br />\nGermans.<br />\nAre they told that<br />\nin the past war soldiers used to run<br />\namuck once in a while and bayonet<br />\nand shoot up the prisoners? Confessions of the Great War officers<br />\nreveal this as a fact. Instead of<br />\nbeing given some instruction in<br />\nthese subjects which would inspire<br />\na healthy hatred for all war, they<br />\ncome out of their training with a<br />\nrosy idea of uniforms, guns on<br />\nshoulders, pretty girls watching<br />\nparades, military bands playing inspiring airs, and so forth.

Each candidate for<br />\nthe highest undergraduate office is a<br />\nmember of a fraternity. Fraternity<br />\ncombines, as in the past, will play an<br />\nimportant role and the nominee having<br />\nthe strongest political support will be<br />\nthe victor, whether or not he deserves<br />\nthe presidency of the Council, if other<br />\nundergraduates show the customary<br />\nnon-interest in the election.<br />\n\"Dirty\" politics must be divorced<br />\nfrom the Student Council election.<br />\nFraternities must abandon the dis1\u00b7eputable, despicable, and dishonorable practice of combining votes, the<br />\nprevailing system which prevents a<br />\nfree, clean election.<br />\nThis important election in the past<br />\nhas been purely an annual fraternity<br />\naffair.

In<br />\nurging that every undergraduate<br />\nmake is his duty to cast his honest<br />\nballot this week, we again appeal to<br />\nfraternities to do their part now in<br />\nfreeing the campus from the taint of<br />\n\"dirty\" politices and vote-combines.<br />\nEach fraternity man should go to the<br />\npolls on Thursday unbound by a<br />\npolitical pledge to vote for a particular<br />\ncandidate.<br />\nUndergraduates should<br />\ngive some thought to this election and<br />\nvote for the man worthy of the office.<br /><br />\nTo Doug Stone<br /><br />\nTO Doug \u00b7 Stone we extend our<br />\ncongratulations upon his election to<br />\nthe presidency of Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa, the outstanding, premier<br />\nhonorary fraternity on the J.

The first version was a<br />\npurely psychological biography; the<br />\npresent book includes a much longer<br />\nbiography and is largely. rewritten.<br />\nThe book was revised after the<br />\nsuggestion of a friendly critic who<br />\ndeclared it should be brought up \u00b7 to<br />\ndate; another had said it should be<br />\nthe official biography of Anatole<br />\nFrance. The current book has been<br />\npraised by William Ellery L('.!onard,<br />\nErnest Boyd, and Burton Rascoe,<br />\namong others.<br />\nAccording to the publishers it is<br />\n\"an adroit and fresh investigation<br />\nof the influence, personal and social,<br />\nwhich produced a great literary<br />\nfigure, written in a lucid style by an<br />\nauthority.\"<br />\nDr. Shanks holds an A.M. from<br />\nColumbia and a Ph.D. from Cornell.<br />\nBe was an instructor in the University of Wisconsin and later an<br />\nassistant professor at the University<br />\nof Tennessee and then at the University of Pennsylvania.

For the purposes of<br />\nthis article the reader may assume,<br />\nif it will make him feel any better,<br />\nthat the R. o. T. c. is a perfect<br />\nmachine for preparation for war;<br />\nor he may agree with me, whichever he prefers.<br />\nI think I am safe in saying that<br />\none factor of all civilization and<br />\nmost particularly during the past<br />\nfifteen years, has been a striving<br />\nafter world peace and the general<br />\noutlawry of war. Always there<br />\nhave been a few struggling pacifists<br />\nto make speeches and write pamphlets; but the majority has simply<br />\nsaid, ''War is inevitable. It would<br />\nbe fine to stop it, but, of course,<br />\nthat is just a pipe dream.\" If I had<br />\nbeen living forty years ago I believe<br />\nI would have agreed with the latter.<br />\nHowever, there exists today a<br />\nweapon in the hands of the truly<br />\ncivilized throughout the world, a<br />\nweapon which not only makes the<br />\nabolition of war possible, but makes<br />\nit inevitable, sometime in the future;<br />\nif--it is used properly. This<br />\nweapon, the most powerful ever in<br />\nthe hands of man, more permeating<br />\nthan big guns, airplanes, and bombs<br />\n-is education. Probably more good<br />\nhas been done by a systematic<br />\nscheme of education in the past one<br />\nhundred years than by any other six<br />\nthings the world has ever known.<br />\nYet there is one thing which it has<br />\nnot accomplished, but which it is<br />\nrapidly coming to, the outlawry of<br />\nwar, completely and irretrievably.<br />\nTHE Johns Hopkins University<br />\nis one of the most highly enlightened institutions of this modern<br />\nsystem of teaching and learning.<br />\nInstead of leading the way for<br />\nother schools as she has so often<br />\ndone before, a unit of the R. 0. T.<br />\nC. exists and thrives at Hopkins.<br />\nThere has been a widely and rapidly spreading movement throughout<br />\nthe country to not only abolish compulsory military training, but also<br />\nto remove military units completely<br />\nfrom the campuses of our civilian<br />\ncolleges. Successful leaders of this<br />\nnew pacifist movement must come<br />\nfrom our schools of higher education ; and we can hardly expect<br />\nthem to come from among the<br />\nmembers of the Officers' Reserve<br />\nCorps! Thus it is imperative that<br />\nmilitary units be abolished from our<br />\ncolleges, and Hopkins along with<br />\nothers of the better universities<br />\nmust lead the way to this end.<br />\nThe young man coming to college<br />\nis at the most gullible and susceptible age. In selecting his course he<br />\nreads in the five pages of the<br />\ncatalogue devoted to the R. 0. T.<br />\nC., that a unit of the R. 0. T. C.<br />\nexists on our campus, as it does in<br />\n\"practically all of the important colleges and universities of the<br />\ncountry.\" Also he le~rns that, \"of<br />\nthe 125 hours credit required for<br />\ngraduation, 17 may be earned in<br />\nthis department-.\" The R. 0 . T . C.<br />\npupil is also paid 30 cents a day for<br />\n\"rations\" during his last two years,<br />\nwhich totals to nearly 100 doflars a<br />\nyear. Besides all this there is a<br />\nsnappy uniform provided for him,<br />\nand the possibility of a commission<br />\nin the Officers' Reserve Corps. The<br />\nschedule of his R. 0. T. C. courses<br />\nis arranged so as to fit in with the<br />\nrest of his subjects. He learns that<br />\nthe courses are generally not difficult, and by the time his parents<br />\nhave read the R. 0. T. C. section<br />\nof the catalogue he finds himself<br />\nirretrievably contracted to two years<br />\nof military training. Of course it's<br />\nnot compulsory; but it's almost unavoidable.<br /><br />\n\"barbarous\" passages, those applying to real warfare, been expurgated fro~ his manual? Is he trained<br />\nin bayonet fighting? Is he told that<br />\nthe more savage, the less educated a<br />\nman is, the better soldier he will<br />\nmake? Arlington Conway says that<br />\nduring the last war the most effective troops came from the least<br />\ncivilized portions of the world; and<br />\nthat the German soldier suffered<br />\nterribly from too much learning.<br />\nHe also tells of one of the best<br />\ntrainers of troops during the war,<br />\nlecturing young men until they had<br />\nlost all remnants of civilization and<br />\nthen turning them loose with<br />\nbayonets on dummys dressed as<br />\nGermans.<br />\nAre they told that<br />\nin the past war soldiers used to run<br />\namuck once in a while and bayonet<br />\nand shoot up the prisoners? Confessions of the Great War officers<br />\nreveal this as a fact. Instead of<br />\nbeing given some instruction in<br />\nthese subjects which would inspire<br />\na healthy hatred for all war, they<br />\ncome out of their training with a<br />\nrosy idea of uniforms, guns on<br />\nshoulders, pretty girls watching<br />\nparades, military bands playing inspiring airs, and so forth. As is<br />\nsaid in an article in the Amercian<br />\nMercury, \"We'll kid them along<br />\nwith the news that they are to die<br />\nfor the glory of the flag, for the<br />\ndefense of democracy, for their<br />\n\\Vives and firesides, to keep God's<br />\ncountry inviolate, to save humanity<br />\nfrom militarism ... kid them with<br />\npictures of Christ on the Cross and<br />\na dead soldier at His feet .. . with<br />\nthe promise of the forgiveness of<br />\ntheir sins and the hope of a glorious<br />\nressurrection.\" I~ appears to me<br />\nthat there is something wrong with<br />\ndemocracy, and God's country if<br />\nhundreds of thousands of our finest<br />\nyoung men must die periodically for<br />\nits maintenance. However, young<br />\nmen right here in Johns Hopkins<br />\nare kidded into believing that they<br />\nmust be ready at any moment to<br />\ngive their young lives for something<br />\nor other-called the honor of their<br />\ncountry. Young men are becoming<br />\ntired of giving of their numbers<br />\ndecade after decade, century after<br />\ncentury, for countries which haven't<br />\nhonor enough to take drastic steps<br />\nto prevent another slaughter.<br />\nFor entirely too long people have<br />\nbeen personifying their governmen..ts.

When<br />\nthis machine acts in such a way as<br />\nto destroy a large number and injure the large majority of those<br />\npeople which it has been erected to<br />\nprotect, it is not acting correctly.<br />\nWhen there exists a part of this<br />\nmachine which is capable of annihilaitng large numbers of innocent<br />\ncitizens, this part must be destroyed.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nProf<br />\nKOUWENHOVEN WILL Absent-Minded<br />\nForgets His Auto<br />\nADDRESS SIGMI XI<br />\nHONOR FRATERNITY<br />\nAssistant Dean Of Engineering School Will Talk<br />\nAt Meeting<br />\nELECTIONS ARE TO<br />\nBE ANNOUNCED<br />\nHopkins Chapter Of Research<br />\nFraternity Founded<br />\nIn 1924<br /><br />\na Lf(J'N<br /><br />\nCfh<br /><br />\nal 4or\"and Lexington NEW YORK<br />\nWhen the Shelton opened (7<br />\nyears ago) we began catering to<br />\ncollege men and women.
