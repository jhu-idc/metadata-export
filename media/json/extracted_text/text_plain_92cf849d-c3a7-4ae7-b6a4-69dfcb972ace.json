We know definitely of $7,500 a year which<br />\ngoes into the insatiable maw of the department and<br />\nof nobody-knows-how-much else in gate receipts. Yet<br />\nall we get in exchange is the piteous tale,\"No money\".<br />\nThis may all have gone in unquestionably legitimate<br />\nChannels, and we assert positively that we mean to insinuate nothing else.

This time it favors us with a superb case in<br />\npoint for the criticism which we made of the Student Activities Council in our last issue.<br />\nIt may be recalled that we pointed out the ineffectiveness and consequent uselessness of that body,<br />\naround which an aura of traditional unassailability has<br />\nhovered. Powerless to act in anything vital and prey<br />\nto every minor shifting of political whims, it has long<br />\nbecome a dead and cumbersome organ.<br />\nLast Friday at its first meeting of the year it<br />\nwas faced with a problem\u2014that of the Band-Barnstormer row\u2014about which, it was admitted by the<br />\nS.

The period of the meeting was wasted in vain<br />\nsee-sawing argument which uncovered a total of no<br />\nnew phases of the question.<br />\nOur slant is not that the purposes and duties of<br />\nthe Council are unimportant but that the Council itself is a most inefficient organ for performing the<br />\nfunctions.

We know definitely of $7,500 a year which<br />\ngoes into the insatiable maw of the department and<br />\nof nobody-knows-how-much else in gate receipts. Yet<br />\nall we get in exchange is the piteous tale,\"No money\".<br />\nThis may all have gone in unquestionably legitimate<br />\nChannels, and we assert positively that we mean to insinuate nothing else.
