This cinder trail, constructed of furnace debris, has never proved satisfactory and has been a constant<br />\nsource of complaint. Its uneven surface anll deep ruts have been the<br />\ncauses of continual grumbling from automobile drivers.<br />\nFrom time to time, this poor condition has been temporarily remedied by summoning a corps of workmen to fill in the holes and smooth \u2022<br />\nthe surface. But, after every rainfall, the road always returns to its<br />\nformer condition. Heavy trucks and passenger automobiles grind the<br />\ncinders into the soft mud and form deep ruts which rival the shell<br />\nholes of No Man's Land.<br />\nThe present cinder road certainly adds ncithing to the beauty of<br />\nthe campus. and its constant repairing must form an important item<br />\n. in the list of University expenditures. We feel that the present policy<br />\nof attempting to save Money by maintaining this makeshift driveway<br />\nwill prove far from economical. \u2022<br />\nA new, concrete road would soon pay for itself. The appearance of the campus would be greatly improved and the curses of irate \u2022<br />\nmotorists would be silenced.<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\nPRINCESS AND STUDENTS<br />\nNPERGRADUATE students could easily sympathize with the<br />\nplight of Princess Jacqueline, the \"talking dog\". Unused to<br />\nthe mysteries of university life, the princess' mistress unfortunately selected a day in examination week for the exhibition of her loquacious<br />\ncanine. Instead of speaking her piece before theprofessors' investigating committee, her royal highness was Afflicted with a severe case of<br />\nstage fright and proceeded to utter only unintelligible yelps and barks.'<br />\nMeanwhile, on another part of the campus, the undergraduates<br />\nwere suffering a fate similar to that of the French bulldog. Confronted with long lists of mimeographed questions, the harassed scholars trepthled and grew pale. :Nauseated expressions overspread their<br />\ncountenances as they crunched lead pencils between their teeth. While<br />\nthe princess was howling \"waw,wav.-,waw's\", the students were fran\u2022<br />\ntically 'scribbling 4n their examination books. s<br />\nJudging from the newspaper accounts, and the white slip posted<br />\non the class room door jambs, neither the princess nor the undergraduates were able to convince the pedagogues that they assess an unusual amount of knowledge. Princess Jacqueline's vocabulary shrank<br />\nto a mere series of howls, while the scholars' amount of learning seems<br />\nto have been equally scant.<br />\nThe tragic feature of the story is this:\u2014whereas the students<br />\ncould drown their sorrows at the Second Cotillon, the poor little princess had to content herself with a hard, dry dog biscuit and a little<br />\nwater. But that, after all, is a dog's life.<br />\n<br />\nBACK'ON YOUR PERCH<br />\nAST year, the editor of this paper and the blue pencil expert of<br />\nour worthy contemporary, the Black and Blue Jay, engaged in<br />\na hectic journalistic combat which kept the campus in an uproar for<br />\nthe better part of the semester. Judging from a few random phrases<br />\nin the current issue of the Jay, it would seem that our neighbors wish<br />\nto renew the conflict by making disparaging remarks concerning the<br />\ncharacter of the news dispensed by this sheet.<br />\nIn reply to the Jay, we might add that the NEws-LETTER will<br />\ncarry column after column of Hearstian news, just as soon as some<br />\nbrave lad volunteers to burn down Gilman Hall, dynamite the Barn<br />\nand assassinate the faculty.

L. C<br />\n<br />\nAT<br />\n<br />\nSPEAKING<br />\n<br />\nHomtwood Field<br />\nith and St. Paul Streets<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\nEvery exattilhation week, as it<br />\nlooms above \u2022 the horizon, reopens<br />\nthe question of the advisability of a<br />\nso-called \"Honor System.\" At Johns<br />\nHopkins anyone daring even to suggest that it isn't all that it is supposed to be is at once denounced as<br />\na heretic of the first order and unfit<br />\nm breathe our Charles Street-air.<br />\nTo each succeeding class our student<br />\njournalists, statesmen, \"literati,\"<br />\npoliticians. fraternity men, and advisers explain what the Honor System is, and that of all the mundane<br />\nheritages it is the greatest, the most<br />\nsacred, the most noble, and that it<br />\nis the sworn duty of every student<br />\nto uphold it. Of .course, as long as<br />\nit is the system in force, it is the<br />\nduty of every student to uphold it,<br />\nand most certainly it is an excellent<br />\nsystem. But in spite of contrary<br />\nopinion, even so cherished a scheme<br />\nas this may not work.<br />\nThat underlying fallacy. and the<br />\npoint most neglected by those who<br />\nsponsor this system. is that at Hopkins we have only an average set of<br />\nmen. We point with infinite pride<br />\nto the fact that hundreds of colleges<br />\nhave given up honor for the secretservice and that at our most venerated institution honor reigns on<br />\nhigh. Certainly, we do not think<br />\nthat our 800 undergrads are more<br />\nhonest and more trustworthy than<br />\nall other student bodies. Yet we<br />\nclaim that on our campus honor and<br />\nvirtue are so much revered that they<br />\njust radiate from the chimes of Gilman Hall.<br />\nIn every set of men there are<br />\nthose who will cheat no matter what<br />\nobstacles are set in their paths, and<br />\nthere are those who readily sacrifice<br />\ntheir honor if given the opportunity<br />\nbut who have not the Satanic genius<br />\nto create it themselves. and there are<br />\nthose who under no circumstances,<br />\nand in spite of all temptation will<br />\nnever write a word which is not<br />\ntheir own. For the latter class,<br />\nwhich I think is the largest, an<br />\nHonor System is unnecessary. For<br />\nthe first two it is folly.<br />\nThe Honor System creates opportunity for that body of men who<br />\nwould cheat if they could and in no<br />\nway checks those men who will cheat<br />\nanywhere. At the University of<br />\nMaryland. during examinations, the<br />\nstudents sit at tables nailed ten feet<br />\napart on all sides, the lavatories are<br />\nlocked, and snoopers parade majestically ap and down the aisles. Yet<br />\na great deal of acknowledged cheating goes on, and I dare say the<br />\namount is no less than here at Johns<br />\nHopkins. For there is a great deal<br />\nof cheating at Hopkins. and shutting one's eyes and saying \"no\" does<br />\nin no. way alter the situation' In<br />\n<br />\nover to him and saying: \"Sir, we<br />\ndon't do that here.\" And then you<br />\nare supposed to watch hint. If he<br />\ncontinues his erring ways you are<br />\nduty bound to report him ind appear against hint. When he is expelled, then the evident reward is a<br />\nposition on the \"1\u2014 cabinet But<br />\nwho really does that?<br />\nBut, our moralists reply , all men<br />\nhave to sign the pledge! The pledge<br />\nitself is a fallacy. A cheater will<br />\nsign the pledge idiom any pangs<br />\nof conscience, and the pledge is unnecessary for the nian who is honest.<br />\nWhen a man faces the alternative<br />\nof either cheating or not graduating,<br />\n(needing, for instance, an \"8\" to<br />\nbalance a first semester \"6\") he is<br />\nvery apt to overlook possible damages to his honor. When a man balances the question of copying an answer or receiving the. stigma of<br />\nflunking out, he is far more apt to<br />\nconsider the averting of an open disgrace as flunking more important<br />\nthan averting the less probable an<br />\n\"pianissimo\" disgrace of expulsiols<br />\nfor violation of the Honor System.<br />\nHowever, as the Honor System<br />\naccomplishes as much as any other<br />\nand as it is a source of pride to the<br />\nHopkins undergrad. one of the few<br />\nsources of undergraduate pride kit<br />\nsince the divine birth of the New<br />\nPlan, there is no real reason why it<br />\nshould not be retained.

This cinder trail, constructed of furnace debris, has never proved satisfactory and has been a constant<br />\nsource of complaint. Its uneven surface anll deep ruts have been the<br />\ncauses of continual grumbling from automobile drivers.<br />\nFrom time to time, this poor condition has been temporarily remedied by summoning a corps of workmen to fill in the holes and smooth \u2022<br />\nthe surface. But, after every rainfall, the road always returns to its<br />\nformer condition. Heavy trucks and passenger automobiles grind the<br />\ncinders into the soft mud and form deep ruts which rival the shell<br />\nholes of No Man's Land.<br />\nThe present cinder road certainly adds ncithing to the beauty of<br />\nthe campus. and its constant repairing must form an important item<br />\n. in the list of University expenditures. We feel that the present policy<br />\nof attempting to save Money by maintaining this makeshift driveway<br />\nwill prove far from economical. \u2022<br />\nA new, concrete road would soon pay for itself. The appearance of the campus would be greatly improved and the curses of irate \u2022<br />\nmotorists would be silenced.<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\nPRINCESS AND STUDENTS<br />\nNPERGRADUATE students could easily sympathize with the<br />\nplight of Princess Jacqueline, the \"talking dog\". Unused to<br />\nthe mysteries of university life, the princess' mistress unfortunately selected a day in examination week for the exhibition of her loquacious<br />\ncanine. Instead of speaking her piece before theprofessors' investigating committee, her royal highness was Afflicted with a severe case of<br />\nstage fright and proceeded to utter only unintelligible yelps and barks.'<br />\nMeanwhile, on another part of the campus, the undergraduates<br />\nwere suffering a fate similar to that of the French bulldog. Confronted with long lists of mimeographed questions, the harassed scholars trepthled and grew pale. :Nauseated expressions overspread their<br />\ncountenances as they crunched lead pencils between their teeth. While<br />\nthe princess was howling \"waw,wav.-,waw's\", the students were fran\u2022<br />\ntically 'scribbling 4n their examination books. s<br />\nJudging from the newspaper accounts, and the white slip posted<br />\non the class room door jambs, neither the princess nor the undergraduates were able to convince the pedagogues that they assess an unusual amount of knowledge. Princess Jacqueline's vocabulary shrank<br />\nto a mere series of howls, while the scholars' amount of learning seems<br />\nto have been equally scant.<br />\nThe tragic feature of the story is this:\u2014whereas the students<br />\ncould drown their sorrows at the Second Cotillon, the poor little princess had to content herself with a hard, dry dog biscuit and a little<br />\nwater. But that, after all, is a dog's life.<br /><br />\nBACK'ON YOUR PERCH<br />\nAST year, the editor of this paper and the blue pencil expert of<br />\nour worthy contemporary, the Black and Blue Jay, engaged in<br />\na hectic journalistic combat which kept the campus in an uproar for<br />\nthe better part of the semester. Judging from a few random phrases<br />\nin the current issue of the Jay, it would seem that our neighbors wish<br />\nto renew the conflict by making disparaging remarks concerning the<br />\ncharacter of the news dispensed by this sheet.<br />\nIn reply to the Jay, we might add that the NEws-LETTER will<br />\ncarry column after column of Hearstian news, just as soon as some<br />\nbrave lad volunteers to burn down Gilman Hall, dynamite the Barn<br />\nand assassinate the faculty. Until the dawn of that Utopian day of<br />\ncampus journalism, we must content ourself with the prosaic news of<br />\nthe most prosaic university campus in America.<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\ncollegian rises to heights of liberPREFACE<br />\nalism./ He gets his religious thought<br />\nA few weeks ago there appeared<br />\nfrom Harry Emerson Fosdick, de-LETTER<br />\nNEWS<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\ncolumns<br />\nin the<br />\nthat Roosevelt May not have<br />\ncides<br />\nof<br />\npurpose<br />\nan editorial, the avowed<br />\nright, and reads Ameralii'ays<br />\nbeen<br />\nHumor.<br />\nwhich was to roast College<br />\nAge.

L. C<br /><br />\nAT<br /><br />\nSPEAKING<br /><br />\nHomtwood Field<br />\nith and St. Paul Streets<br /><br />\nF<br />\nEvery exattilhation week, as it<br />\nlooms above \u2022 the horizon, reopens<br />\nthe question of the advisability of a<br />\nso-called \"Honor System.\" At Johns<br />\nHopkins anyone daring even to suggest that it isn't all that it is supposed to be is at once denounced as<br />\na heretic of the first order and unfit<br />\nm breathe our Charles Street-air.<br />\nTo each succeeding class our student<br />\njournalists, statesmen, \"literati,\"<br />\npoliticians. fraternity men, and advisers explain what the Honor System is, and that of all the mundane<br />\nheritages it is the greatest, the most<br />\nsacred, the most noble, and that it<br />\nis the sworn duty of every student<br />\nto uphold it. Of .course, as long as<br />\nit is the system in force, it is the<br />\nduty of every student to uphold it,<br />\nand most certainly it is an excellent<br />\nsystem. But in spite of contrary<br />\nopinion, even so cherished a scheme<br />\nas this may not work.<br />\nThat underlying fallacy. and the<br />\npoint most neglected by those who<br />\nsponsor this system. is that at Hopkins we have only an average set of<br />\nmen. We point with infinite pride<br />\nto the fact that hundreds of colleges<br />\nhave given up honor for the secretservice and that at our most venerated institution honor reigns on<br />\nhigh. Certainly, we do not think<br />\nthat our 800 undergrads are more<br />\nhonest and more trustworthy than<br />\nall other student bodies. Yet we<br />\nclaim that on our campus honor and<br />\nvirtue are so much revered that they<br />\njust radiate from the chimes of Gilman Hall.<br />\nIn every set of men there are<br />\nthose who will cheat no matter what<br />\nobstacles are set in their paths, and<br />\nthere are those who readily sacrifice<br />\ntheir honor if given the opportunity<br />\nbut who have not the Satanic genius<br />\nto create it themselves. and there are<br />\nthose who under no circumstances,<br />\nand in spite of all temptation will<br />\nnever write a word which is not<br />\ntheir own. For the latter class,<br />\nwhich I think is the largest, an<br />\nHonor System is unnecessary. For<br />\nthe first two it is folly.<br />\nThe Honor System creates opportunity for that body of men who<br />\nwould cheat if they could and in no<br />\nway checks those men who will cheat<br />\nanywhere. At the University of<br />\nMaryland. during examinations, the<br />\nstudents sit at tables nailed ten feet<br />\napart on all sides, the lavatories are<br />\nlocked, and snoopers parade majestically ap and down the aisles. Yet<br />\na great deal of acknowledged cheating goes on, and I dare say the<br />\namount is no less than here at Johns<br />\nHopkins. For there is a great deal<br />\nof cheating at Hopkins. and shutting one's eyes and saying \"no\" does<br />\nin no. way alter the situation' In<br /><br />\nover to him and saying: \"Sir, we<br />\ndon't do that here.\" And then you<br />\nare supposed to watch hint. If he<br />\ncontinues his erring ways you are<br />\nduty bound to report him ind appear against hint. When he is expelled, then the evident reward is a<br />\nposition on the \"1\u2014 cabinet But<br />\nwho really does that?<br />\nBut, our moralists reply , all men<br />\nhave to sign the pledge! The pledge<br />\nitself is a fallacy. A cheater will<br />\nsign the pledge idiom any pangs<br />\nof conscience, and the pledge is unnecessary for the nian who is honest.<br />\nWhen a man faces the alternative<br />\nof either cheating or not graduating,<br />\n(needing, for instance, an \"8\" to<br />\nbalance a first semester \"6\") he is<br />\nvery apt to overlook possible damages to his honor. When a man balances the question of copying an answer or receiving the. stigma of<br />\nflunking out, he is far more apt to<br />\nconsider the averting of an open disgrace as flunking more important<br />\nthan averting the less probable an<br />\n\"pianissimo\" disgrace of expulsiols<br />\nfor violation of the Honor System.<br />\nHowever, as the Honor System<br />\naccomplishes as much as any other<br />\nand as it is a source of pride to the<br />\nHopkins undergrad. one of the few<br />\nsources of undergraduate pride kit<br />\nsince the divine birth of the New<br />\nPlan, there is no real reason why it<br />\nshould not be retained.
