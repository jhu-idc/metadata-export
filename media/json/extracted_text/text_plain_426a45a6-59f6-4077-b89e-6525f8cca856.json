Are they<br />\na bunch of scheming student<br />\npoliticos, or just decent, hardworking boys and girls? The<br />\nNews-Letter has made an attempt to answer these and other<br />\nquestions, and also to set the<br />\nrecord straight about some of<br />\nthe basic functions and structure<br />\nof the SAC.<br />\nThe SAC general organization consists of representatives<br />\nfrom 39 student groups, ranging<br />\nfrom the Black Students Association to the Course Guide, the<br />\n<br />\nEisenhower Symposium, to the<br />\nNews-Letter, and even to the<br />\nStudent Council itself.<br />\nThe<br />\nbudgets of these groups range<br />\nfrom $100 to $12,000, but most<br />\nare at the $3-6000 level. The<br />\ngeneral organization meets twice<br />\neach semester, leaving the bulk<br />\nof the SAC business to be<br />\ncarried on by the seven members<br />\nof the SAC executive board.<br />\nThe Executive Board consists of the Student Council<br />\ntreasurer, who serves as its<br />\nchairman (this year, Susan<br />\nAnderson); the Student Council<br />\nPresident (Michael Steele); the<br />\nadministration's Director of Student Activities, Chris Colombo;<br />\nand four members of the SAC<br />\ngeneral organization, chosen by<br />\ntheir colleagues.<br />\nThe four<br />\nmember elected at the beginning<br />\nof this year were Debby Jeffrey,<br />\ncont on p 2<br />\n<br />\ndemonstrate need.<br />\nAlso proposed was the elimination of in-school interest<br />\nsubsidies. Presently the Federal<br />\nGovernment is picking up the<br />\ninterest tab, -but in the future<br />\nstudents would be expected to<br />\nmake interest payments while<br />\nstill in school or to defer these<br />\npayments until after school,<br />\nthereby increasing their postgraduation debt by up to 40%.<br />\nThe Administration also<br />\nwants lenders to charge prevailing market interest rates,now at<br />\nmore then 17 percent, on parent<br />\nloans. Presently the rate is set at<br />\n9 percent and the government<br />\nmakes up the difference.<br />\nPell grants would require<br />\nincreased contributions from the<br />\nfamily and the students themselves. The Student Loan Marketing Association would no<br />\nlonger receive federal funds, and<br />\nthe Social Security Benefit Program would be phased out over<br />\nfour years.

As chairman of the<br />\nAppropriations Subcommittee<br />\non Foreign Operations, he felt<br />\nthat it was necessary to be as<br />\nknowledgeable about the Salvadorian situation as possible<br />\nbefore his subcommittee made<br />\nrecommendations to the House<br />\nof Representatives.<br />\nLong said he discovered that<br />\ninvolvement in El Salvador<br />\nwould be \"far more complicated\" than the Reagan administration realizes. He said Salvadorian<br />\npresident<br />\nNapolean<br />\nDuarte and other government<br />\n3fficials neither want nor need<br />\nthe military aid that the administration wants to give them,<br />\nadding that the Salvadorians<br />\nwould prefer economic and<br />\npolitical support from the<br />\nUnited States. Long quoted<br />\nDuarte as saying, \"It is no use in<br />\nhaving (a well-armed) army if<br />\npeople are dying of hunger.\"<br />\nAccording to the congressman,<br />\nEl Salvador has the ability to<br />\ndefeat the- guerilla movement<br />\nbut needs help in revitalizing the<br />\neconomy. \"It is the failure<br />\nof the economy that is leading<br />\nto communism in this country,\"<br />\nclaimed Long, \"not guerilla<br />\nfighting.\"<br />\nLong called the land reform<br />\nprogram of El Salvador \"slow<br />\nand ineffective.\" He claimed<br />\ncont on p 2<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2/ APRIL 10, 1981<br />\n<br />\nBoard A Mixed Bag,Better Than Last Year<br />\ncont from p I<br />\nDana Whitehead, Kevil Duhon,<br />\nand Michael Banton. Banton<br />\nresigned early in the year,<br />\nand the Board operated without<br />\na seventh member until after<br />\nspring break, when it appointed<br />\nLaura Rosenthal.<br />\nThe Board has three main<br />\nfunctions: to award or deny<br />\nSAC-member status and funding<br />\nto new groups; to decide on<br />\nannual budgets for member<br />\ngroups; and to provide financial<br />\nassistance, when necessary, for<br />\nmember groups during the<br />\ncourse of the year. The SAC<br />\ngets the bulk of its money<br />\n($84,000 last year) from the<br />\nbudget of the Dean of Academic<br />\nServices, Joseph Hall. Additional revenues ($6,000 last year)<br />\ncome from the profits of Spring<br />\nFair, and go into an SAC contingency fund for new or financially troubled groups during the<br />\nyear.<br />\nAccording to Chris<br />\nColombo, the Fair finished with<br />\n$12,000 last year, $6,000 of<br />\nwhich was seed money from the<br />\nyear before--hence a $6,000<br />\nprofit. $8,000 of that money<br />\nwas given to the Spring Fair as<br />\nseed money Otis year, while<br />\n$4,000 went to the SAC contingency fund. About two-thirds<br />\nof this fund has been given this<br />\nyear to new or financially<br />\ntroubled groups, and the remaining third has gone back to the<br />\nFair as \"start-up change\" for<br />\nstudent booths.<br />\nComments and criticisms<br />\nabout the SAC Executive Board<br />\nfall into two categories: assessments of this particular Board's<br />\nperformance (1980-81), and<br />\nbroader feelings about the nature of the Board as an institu-<br />\n<br />\ntion. There seems to be a clear<br />\nconsensus that this year's Board<br />\nis an improvement over last<br />\nyear's. Even Gretchen Luebbe,<br />\npresident of the JHU Band and<br />\non specific matters an outspoken<br />\ncritic of this year's group, says,<br />\n\"There's no question that<br />\nSusan's board is better than the<br />\none under Karl Block (last year's<br />\nchairman). There was no talking<br />\n<br />\nto Karl past a certain point; he'd<br />\njust turn you off.\"<br />\nDebby Jeffrey, an activity<br />\nrepresentative both this year and<br />\nlast, agrees. \"Last year, you<br />\nwould come in to talk to the<br />\nboard, and they would put you<br />\nall the way down at the other<br />\nend of the conference table like<br />\nthey were sitting in judgement<br />\non you, she says. \"There was<br />\n<br />\ncone from p I<br />\nthat the use of socialist cooperatives gives the wbrkers no<br />\nincentive for production. He<br />\ncontended that if the people<br />\nwere allowed to own their own<br />\nland, more food would be<br />\nproduced. This would lead to a<br />\nmore efficient capitalistic society, Long said, which would be<br />\nin the best interests of El Salvador. If the U.S. must get involved, he added, we should aid<br />\nthe country in improving its<br />\nagricultural capabilities.<br />\n\"El Salvador has more weapons than they know what to do<br />\nwith,\" Long continued. By<br />\nincreasing arms shipments to this<br />\nnation, he said,the United States<br />\nis upsetting the Central American balance of power. Long<br />\ncontended that of the main<br />\nmotivations for Reagan's insistence on \"pumping arms into El<br />\nSalvador\" is to prove that the<br />\nU.S. is not \"a paper tiger.\" Long<br />\nclaimed that America cannot<br />\ndirectly antagonize the Soviet<br />\nUnion or Cuba, so \"we are<br />\nshowing strength by picking on<br />\ntiny El Salvador.\"<br />\nFollowing the congress-<br />\n<br />\nman's speech, the Progressive<br />\nStudents Union (PSU) held a<br />\nforum on political repression<br />\nand its link to economic crisis.<br />\nFour speakers spoke before the<br />\n70 people attending the first<br />\nforum organized by the PSU.<br />\nAnthony Robinson, a local attorney working with the Atlanta<br />\nSupport Committee, spoke on<br />\nthe \"rise in racism in the U.S.<br />\nsymbolized by the Atlanta murders.\" Robinson said that until<br />\nthe Atanta child killers are<br />\nfound, one cannot know if it is<br />\na racist event. However,he cited<br />\nracial killings in Buffalo and Salt<br />\nLake Ciyt, the resurgence of the<br />\nKlu Klux Klan and the Nazi<br />\nparty, the election of Ronald<br />\nReagan, and the increase in<br />\npolice brutality as symptoms of<br />\nan increase in racism. He said<br />\nracism historically increases at<br />\nany time there is an economic<br />\ncrisis because the masses look<br />\nfor a scapegoat on which to<br />\nblame the problems. In the<br />\nUnited States today, he contended, those who can least afford<br />\nfunding cuts, such as those in<br />\nCETA and college scholarships,<br />\nare being punished by being<br />\n<br />\nTerm Papers and Theses<br />\n366-3873<br />\n<br />\nRepresentative Long<br />\neconomic reasons for<br />\nthe<br />\nUnited States involvement in El<br />\nSalvador, claiming the major<br />\nmotive was to warn other<br />\nnations. She also said U.S.<br />\ncommercial banks loan money<br />\nto foreign nations to cover<br />\ninternational debts and these<br />\ndebts may not be repayed if a<br />\n<br />\nrevolution occurs.

It is not objective reporting to act as little<br />\nmore than a press release; both<br />\nsides of the story need to be<br />\ntold. For instance, the reason<br />\ngiven for the ripoff of student<br />\ngroups is that \"it makes them<br />\noperate more efficiently.\" Apparently a group operates efficiently only when half their<br />\ngross profits after other expenses<br />\nare going to the committee. For<br />\nexample, the JSA has had to<br />\ntake out a loan from the SAC to<br />\npay for their booth; t-e fee was<br />\nalmost as large as their entire<br />\nbudget for, the year.<br />\nThis<br />\nlatest explanation is a new one<br />\nto me. Previously the exorbitant<br />\n<br />\nfees were excused as paying<br />\nfor expenses. The article states<br />\nthat student fees were 15% of<br />\nthe $40,000 total profit, or<br />\n$6,000.<br />\nWhy couldn't the<br />\nstudent groups be allowed to<br />\nkeep their own money?<br />\nThe truth is that co-chairmen Quinn and Abrams couldn't<br />\ncare less about any of the<br />\nstudent groups making money.<br />\nAs long as the Fair makes a<br />\nprofit, they'll be satisfied, even<br />\nif the student groups lose their<br />\nshirts. As evidence I offer some<br />\nof the actions and statements of<br />\nthese potentates.<br />\nGroups are told that they<br />\nwill have a session to 'negotiate'<br />\ntheir contracts with the Food<br />\nCommittee of the Spring Fair.<br />\nA typical statement from the<br />\nchairman of this committee was<br />\n\"$350.00, take it or leave it.\"<br />\nWhen a complaint was voiced<br />\nover the ridiculously high price,<br />\nthe group was told \"Look, if<br />\nyou don't want it there are<br />\nplenty of outside vendors who<br />\nwould pay a lot more for the<br />\nspace than you, so just be happy<br />\nwe give it to you at all.\" A<br />\nreally understanding negotiating<br />\nstyle: When told that these high<br />\nfees would hurt profits, the<br />\nSpring Fair says \"Raise prices.\"<br />\nThe best statement of all<br />\nwas a Freudian slip by the Food<br />\nCommittee chairman who got<br />\nangry at the criticism he was<br />\ntaking and said \"You people<br />\ncome in here and expect....\"<br />\nThose present had to remind<br />\nhim that student groups don't<br />\n'come in here.' We are already<br />\nhere, remember? Groups that<br />\nwon't roll over and just shut up<br />\nand accept the screwing from<br />\nthe Spring Fair are told publically by Abrams that they are<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nTrouble In Paradise<br />\n<br />\nOur Reader's Right<br />\ncont.from p. 4<br />\ntroublemakers, and that if they<br />\ndon't just shut up they will be<br />\ndenied a booth next year. Since<br />\nwhen was the Spring Fair a<br />\ndictatorship?<br />\nThis arrogant, dictatorial<br />\nattitude toward anyone who<br />\nprotests the actions of the Hitler<br />\nYouth running the Fair this year<br />\nis totally out of keeping with the<br />\npurpose of the Fair. The main<br />\ngoal shouldn't be 'money,<br />\nmoney, money.' This is supposed to be for the students to<br />\nhave fun and raise some money<br />\nfor their groups. I for one am<br />\nfed up with being abused by the<br />\npower-hungry maniacs that are<br />\nrunning things this year. Why<br />\nisn't the SC looking into the<br />\nhuge fees that students are forced<br />\nto,.pay? Of course, the answer<br />\ngiven is that the money goes to<br />\nthe SAC for distribution to all<br />\ngroups. Well, it is interesting to<br />\nnote that while SAC groups<br />\nhave to count anticipated Spring<br />\nFair revenue in their revenue<br />\nestimates, and therefore get<br />\nless money from the SAC, the<br />\nSAC Executive Board, to whom<br />\nall budgets are submitted, and<br />\nwho parcels out activity money,<br />\nnever even mentioned the<br />\n$15,000 that the News-Letter<br />\narticle seems to imply it received. What happened to all<br />\nthis money? Why is it kept as a<br />\nslush fund and not given out to<br />\nthe SAC groups along with the<br />\nmoney the administration gives<br />\nthem? If the student groups are<br />\nforced to count Spring Fair<br />\nmoney, shouldn't the SAC at<br />\nleast account for this money?<br />\nShouldn't they give it out to the<br />\ngroups who had booths, from<br />\nwhom it was taken in the<br />\nfirst place in enormous fees? I'd<br />\nlike to hear some answers, Mr.<br />\nAbrams, Mr.Colombo.<br />\nI ask that my name not be<br />\npublished because I do not wish<br />\nthe group to which I belong to<br />\nbe retaliated against either by<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board or by<br />\nthe Spring Fair Committee. It<br />\nhas been known to happen<br />\nbefore, and since I am only a<br />\nmember, and not an officer, I do<br />\nnot want the group to suffer<br />\nfrom my speaking out. Lest I be<br />\naccused of making personal<br />\nattacks on anyone mentioned,<br />\nlet me state that I do not know<br />\nany of them personally, I have<br />\nmerely what I have seen and<br />\nheard to go on.

The<br />\nsame little comedy played itself<br />\nout a short time later with Harris<br />\nGruman's \"My Dream,\" a story<br />\nwhich critically examined the<br />\nsexual fantasies of a Victorian<br />\ncharacter. The fraternity poster<br />\ncontroversy earlier this semester<br />\nfurther heightened the hilarity.<br />\nMeanwhile, a recent survey<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins Employees Association shows that a<br />\nof Hopkins' female<br />\nthird<br />\noffice workers have experienced<br />\nsome form of sexism on the<br />\njob--sexism which, in many<br />\ncases, prevents these women<br />\nfrom advancing or using their<br />\ntalents to the fullest. How many<br />\nletters has the News-Letter refrom the Graduate<br />\nceived<br />\nWomen's Organization of the M.<br />\nCarey Thomas Women's Center<br />\non that subject? None come to<br />\nmind.<br />\nOf course, such foolishness<br />\n<br />\nis hardly confined to HomeWhen Playboy was<br />\nwood.<br />\nputting together its \"Women of<br />\nthe Ivy League\" pictorial a<br />\ncouple of years ago, a number of<br />\ncampus newspaper editors decided to strike a blow for<br />\nwomen's liberation by refusing<br />\nto allow the photographer to<br />\nadvertise for models in their<br />\npapers. Some blow: all the news<br />\nmedia picked up the story, the<br />\nphotographer was swamped with<br />\ninquiries from women who<br />\nwanted to pose, and Playboy got<br />\nto pose as a martyr to Freedom<br />\nof the Press--a cheap martyrdom<br />\nindeed, because nobody went to<br />\njail protecting his sources or had<br />\nto pay so much as a penny in<br />\nfines.<br />\nBut the anti-Playboy crusade was more than merely<br />\nsilly; it was subtly authoritarian.<br />\nThe editors who refused to sell<br />\nspace to the photographer appointed themselves, in effect, to<br />\nact in loco parentis for their<br />\nfemale readers, protecting the<br />\nLiberated Women Of The Ivy<br />\nLeague from being \"exploited\"<br />\n(i.e., paid a substantial amount<br />\nof money to take off their<br />\nclothes for a few minutes).<br />\nThey assumed that all the<br />\naspiring female doctors, lawyers,,<br />\nscientists, and economists on<br />\ntheir campuses--people who<br />\nhope to take a wide variety of<br />\nleadership positions in American<br />\nsociety\u2014lacked the intelligence,<br />\nmaturity, or judgment to decide for themselves whether to<br />\n<br />\nThe Loop<br />\nstROA<br />\n(Oril<br />\np60<br />\n<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\npose nude.

Now,<br />\nwhile we haven't thrown it all<br />\nthe way open, we exercise less<br />\nstringent controls.\"<br />\nIn the past, the SAC received the groups' itemized<br />\nbudget requests, and crossed off<br />\ndollars in specific areas--in effect<br />\nacting to set the groups' priorities. Now groups are simply<br />\nawarded a set amount, which<br />\nmay or pot be wIlat they requested, and are then allowed to<br />\ndetermine their own priorities.<br />\nThe Board has also made<br />\ntwo internal changes which are,<br />\nat least in theory, beneficial to<br />\nthe activity representatives.<br />\nBoard members have been<br />\nassigned specialized functions in<br />\norder to speed up the paperwork; for example,Jeffrey reads<br />\nall proposed constitutions from<br />\nnew groups, while Kevil Duhon,<br />\nwho is also editor-in-chief of<br />\nEllipsis this year, was in charge<br />\nof ordering the equipment for<br />\nthe publication production room<br />\nset up last semester.<br />\nThe other internal change is<br />\nthat Board members have also<br />\n<br />\neach taken on a set of individual<br />\noffice hours. \"People coming in<br />\nseemed to have an attitude that<br />\nthey could only get what they<br />\nwanted by talking to me,\" says<br />\nSusan Anderson. \"But other<br />\nBoard members can take care of<br />\nthings, too, and so I think that<br />\nhaving office hours for all of us<br />\nis important.\"<br />\nThere are also some serious<br />\ncriticisms of this year's Executive Board, and perhaps the most<br />\nserious of these center around<br />\nthe members', and specifically<br />\nAnderson's, accessibility and<br />\nattendance at office hours.<br />\nBand president Luebbe says she<br />\nhas tried for as long as a week to<br />\nreach Anderson and been unsuccessful, while the administration's SAC financial coordinator,<br />\nBeth Newcombe, has also complained of her inability to meet<br />\nconsistently with Anderson.<br />\nOne student, Wayne Kimball,<br />\nwho was attempting to start a<br />\nmodel United Nations organization at Hopkins, says Anderson's<br />\ninaccessability prevented him<br />\nfrom starting the group in time<br />\nfor a model U.N. conference this<br />\nmonth, despite the fact that he<br />\nfirst approached her at the end<br />\nof last semester.<br />\nAnderson's reply to these<br />\ncharges is that she has kept her<br />\noffice hous faithfully all year.<br />\n\"I have two office hours a<br />\nweek, and if you come in at<br />\nanother time, it may seem to<br />\nyou that I'm never here,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"It bothers me that people<br />\nexpect me to treat this as a<br />\nfull-time job. I do take the job<br />\nseriously, but I'm not a full-time<br />\nemployee--no student can be. I<br />\nthink that is why it is probably<br />\nhistorically a complaint that the<br />\nSAC chairman can't be found.\"<br />\nRegarding the Kimball incident, Anderson says she told<br />\n<br />\ntOet,talii&Wanda-14<br />\n<br />\nKimball that in her judgement,<br />\nhe was better off seeking funding through other channels. \"In<br />\nretrospect, I think he took it as<br />\ndiscouragement, which is not<br />\nhow it was meant,\" she said.<br />\nAnother criticism of this<br />\nyear's Board is that it acted too<br />\nslowly in filling its vacancy<br />\nand proceeded unfairly by filling<br />\nthe vacancy in the manner in<br />\nwhich it ultimately did. Laura<br />\nRosenthal, the recently appointed seventh member, applied for<br />\ntbe job after a candidate deadline had passed and two other<br />\napplicants had submitted their<br />\nnames. One of these first two<br />\napplicants was Gretchen Luebbe,<br />\nwho has often been critical of<br />\nthe Board.<br />\n\"We didn't fill that position<br />\nuntil now because our workload<br />\ndidn't require it, and because<br />\nthere is no constitutional mandate which says that we have to<br />\nfill it,\" Anderson said. \"I<br />\ndecided of my own volition that<br />\nwe should fill it because I knew<br />\nthat we would ultimately need<br />\nsomeone else, even just to share<br />\nin the general legwork.\"<br />\nAnderson says she decided<br />\nto extend the candidate deadline<br />\nwhen she realized that there<br />\nwere several other qualified<br />\npeople who were interested.<br />\n\"I though perhaps that<br />\ncommunications had been poor,<br />\nas they often are among student<br />\ngroups,\" she said. She denies<br />\nthat the SAC general membership was unaware of the move<br />\nhave<br />\nmembers<br />\nsome<br />\n(as<br />\ncharged), saying she' announced<br />\nit at general meeting in March.<br />\n\"Of course, there weren't a<br />\nlot of people at that meeting,<br />\nbut that's usually the case,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nFinally, activity representatives say that Executive Board<br />\n<br />\nmeetings are not regularly scheduled, and are usually poorly<br />\npublicized.<br />\n\"I agree with that criticism,\" says Board member<br />\nJeffrey. \"I'd like to see a regular<br />\nschedule and agenda, as much<br />\nfor us as for anyone else. But<br />\nthe problem is that we set<br />\nmeetings up around people's<br />\nschedules. We had set them up<br />\nto accomodate Mike Banton, but<br />\nthen he quit. Now we've adjust.<br />\ned for Laura, and in between<br />\nthere was a semester change. So<br />\nit's difficult.\"<br />\nBoth Anderson and Jeffrey<br />\nin summing up their response to<br />\ncomplaints made against this<br />\nparticular Board, say that one<br />\nhandicap the Board has had to<br />\ndeal with is the legacy of last<br />\nyear's Board.<br />\n\"They left no coherent<br />\nrecords, so organizationally we<br />\ngot off to a slow start,\"<br />\nAnderson says. \"And I think<br />\npeople automatically feel they're<br />\ndealing with last year's Board,<br />\nand that we're the enemy,and it<br />\ntakes a lot to overcome that.\"<br />\nApart from their feelings<br />\nabout this year's Board, some<br />\nmembers are unhappy with the<br />\ngeneral structure and impact of<br />\nthe Board from year to year.<br />\nOne complaint is. that Director<br />\nof Student Services Chris<br />\nColombo, the administration's<br />\nrepresentative on the Board, has<br />\noften had the effect of \"coopting\" and \"coercing\" the student<br />\nofficers into agreement with his<br />\nviewpoint.<br />\n',My feeling is that he tries<br />\nto come across as if he were<br />\nsaying 'it's up to the Board,<br />\ntalk to Sue or Michael,'but that<br />\nwhat really happens is that what<br />\nChris says goes,\" said one<br />\nwho<br />\nrepresentative<br />\nactivity<br />\nasked not to be named. \"If he<br />\n<br />\nfeels one way,then the other six<br />\nend up voting that way.\"<br />\nThe representative claimed<br />\nto have heard of instances in<br />\nwhich Colombo had decided tie<br />\nBoard votes by saying that his<br />\nvote counted as more than one.<br />\nHowever, both Colombo and the<br />\nBoard members deny that he has<br />\never acted coercively; further,<br />\nthey say that there has not been<br />\na tie vote all year, and that<br />\nCalombo's vote counts no more<br />\nor less than that of any of the<br />\nother members--that, if anyone's<br />\nvote could break a tie, it would<br />\nbe Anderson's.<br />\n\"My position is simply that<br />\nof being one of the seven Board<br />\nmembers,\" Colombo says. \"The<br />\nother members have often voted<br />\nagainst me. It's annoying to<br />\nhear this misconception, because<br />\nhistorically, students have voted<br />\nagainst the administrator's viewpoint. I wish whoever said<br />\nthis would come talk to me.\"<br />\nAnderson says of Colombo<br />\nthat \"he has maintained a very<br />\nlow-key profile on the Board.<br />\nHe'll clarify things for us, and<br />\nhe's mostly been a resource<br />\nwhich we've been glad to use,<br />\nbut I can't ever remember him<br />\nstating his opinion unless I've<br />\nasked him. It's true that as<br />\nDirector of Student Services, not<br />\nas a Board member, he could put<br />\na halt to anything he felt was<br />\nwrong, but he's never used that<br />\npower as far as I know.\"<br />\nJeffrey describes Colombo<br />\nas \"conservative financially, and<br />\ncautious from experience, but<br />\nnot a strongarm type\u2014any excess<br />\npower he has beyond a oneseventh share is a result of our<br />\ntrust and confidence in his<br />\njudgment?'<br />\nShe says Colombo is conservative about things such as<br />\ncentp. 9<br />\n<br />\nThe Office of the Cha lain Proudl Presents its Annual<br />\n<br />\nDog Show<br />\nThe Dogs of Hopkins '81<br />\nLevering Hall Patio<br />\nSunday, April 12<br />\n<br />\nP.O.

The<br />\nFTX began at noon Friday,<br />\nApril 3 and ended at about<br />\n4:00 p.m. Sunday, .Apri15.<br />\nAlthough many cadets do not<br />\nchoose to be infantry officers,<br />\nopting instead for Service Support branches of the Army<br />\n(like the Medical Corps), the<br />\nFTX improves the cadets'<br />\nchances of doing well at<br />\nAdvanced Camp, which each<br />\nfuture officer must attend and<br />\npass during the summer between his or her junior and<br />\nsenior years.<br />\nAfter being assigned to<br />\none of two platoons and issued<br />\nfour C-rations, a weapon (the<br />\nM-16 or the M-60 machine<br />\ngun) and two boxes of blank<br />\nammunition (among other<br />\nthings) the cadets boarded<br />\nbuses and were taken to Fort<br />\nMeade. After brief classes on<br />\nindividual soldiering skills radio<br />\n<br />\noperations and squad tactics,<br />\nthe cadets were led by newly<br />\ndesignated cadet leaders to<br />\ntheir respective Night Defensive Positions (NDP's). At each<br />\nNDP, the platoons were ambushed by members of an<br />\naggressor force (predominantly<br />\nmade up of freshmen Ranger<br />\ncadets), then settled down for<br />\na delicious (???) C-ration dinner. After dinner there was<br />\ninstruction on how to dog a<br />\ndefensive position (popularly<br />\nknown as a foxhole). Next,<br />\nthe cadets were paired off by a<br />\nnew set of cadet leaders and<br />\nassigned a place to dig a<br />\ndefensive position. Although<br />\nnone of the holes were armpitlevel depth, as specified by the<br />\nArmy, the camoflauged defensive positions came in handy<br />\nlater that evening when the<br />\naggressor<br />\nforce<br />\nattacked.<br />\nAfterwards, the cadets unrolled<br />\ntheir sleeping bags and slept<br />\nunder the stars.<br />\nLeadership positions were<br />\nconstantly being changed to<br />\ngive each cadet a chance to<br />\nmake mistakes, and, in the<br />\nprocess, learn a great deal.<br />\nTactical situations were set up<br />\nSaturday to offer the cadet<br />\nleaders constructive criticism<br />\non their decisiveness, enthusiasm, knowledge, confidence,<br />\nability to communicate with<br />\ntheir subordinates, and performace under pressure.<br />\nOn Sunday, the two platoons were issued scopes for<br />\ntheir M-16's and numbered<br />\ncloth covers for their helmets.<br />\nWith these added items, the<br />\n<br />\ncadets were exposed to a more<br />\nrealistic battle situation, since<br />\nthose who exposed themselves<br />\nto the enemy long enough to<br />\nhave their numbers recognized<br />\nwere exposed long enough to<br />\nbe shot. Some cadets realized<br />\nthey had a lot to learn despite<br />\na weekend in the woods, while<br />\nother cadets demonstrated the<br />\nvalue of good camoflauge by<br />\nthoroughly plastering their<br />\nnumbers with mud and leaves.<br />\nAnother highlight of the<br />\nFTX was the hot meal served<br />\nSaturday night. Although the<br />\nfood might have been even<br />\nworse than that served in the<br />\ndorm cafeteria, and an occasional pine needle found its<br />\nway into the mashed potatoes,<br />\n<br />\na meal from Danny's couldn's<br />\nhave done more for the morale.<br />\nLater Saturday night (and<br />\nwell into Sunday morning) one<br />\nof the night patrols found use<br />\nfor tbis newly found morale.<br />\nAfter maneuvring through<br />\nbriars, and marching on overgrown dirt road,the \"Northern<br />\nParkway Patrol\" began to<br />\ncomb the woods for the enemy<br />\nNight<br />\nDefensive Position.<br />\nAfter a period of searching,the<br />\npatrol open-fired on the trees<br />\nand let out enthusiastic battle<br />\ncries, hoping to stir something<br />\nup. When the enemy still<br />\nevaded discovery, enthusiasm<br />\nabated. \"Where are we?\" a<br />\ncadet asked. Eventually the<br />\nPatrol stumbled on Northern<br />\n<br />\nParkway, but unfortunately<br />\nlost radio contact with the rest<br />\nof the ROTC detachment. The<br />\npatrol finally returned to camp<br />\nat 5:00 a.m., just in time for<br />\nbreakfast.<br />\nOn Sunday afternoon, the<br />\ncadets cleaned their weapons<br />\nand, at last, were dismissed to<br />\ngo home to showers and beds.<br />\nIf, while you are studying in<br />\nthe Hut, you happen to notice<br />\nsomeone covered with scratches, and, perhaps, still sporting<br />\ngreen camoflauge coloring behind his ears, ask about the<br />\nFTX.

Reading graduate student<br />\ntheses is an interesting endeavor at times also and they<br />\nwould be the ones doing the grading<br />\nI really<br />\ndo see problems with trying to approach it on a large<br />\nscale, in a large class.<br />\nRICHARD CONE(BIOPHYSICS)<br />\n<br />\nN-L: I'd like you to describe the peer grading system<br />\nyou've developed for science majors.<br />\nCone: I started working on the peer grading method for<br />\nevaluating papers in the course about eight years ago<br />\nwhen I first started teaching physiology, because when I<br />\nmade it a general introductory course in physiology,<br />\nabout 270 students applied and I didn't have any teaching assistants. Yet I wanted the students, instead of<br />\nhaving exams, quizzes or final exams, to be evaluated in<br />\nthe course by how well they could write papers on<br />\nscientific topics. So this peer grading method came out<br />\nof (the question of) how to fairly evaluate a large<br />\nnumber of papers.<br />\nOne of the first things I realized is that in a large<br />\ncourse, it becomes a very boring procedure to read paper<br />\nafter paper and try to evaluate them. In fact, I found<br />\nthat after I had read about 10 papers<br />\nI would<br />\nalready begin to get bored, but that I could do a goo<br />\njob on 8 or 9 or<br />\n10 papers. So I started t<br />\nis there a way in which everybody could e<br />\nthing like 10 papers, and thereby ha<br />\nthe course evaluated by fresh m<br />\nbetter way to evaluate a pape<br />\nthe peers in the course eval<br />\nI realized that if<br />\nthe challenge was to w<br />\nmates instead of t<br />\npaper for the pr<br />\nchanges a lot.<br />\ncal material<br />\nmost scien<br />\npapers ar<br />\nany ti<br />\nore<br />\nclear<br />\ns more<br />\nim<br />\na paper well<br />\novides) exactly<br />\ng to write a good<br />\nship, but they know<br />\nis really writing for a<br />\n<br />\nelieve they could evaluate<br />\n1 feeling: \"Well, how can I<br />\nt you can turn that question<br />\nn I expect a student to write a<br />\n't discriminate between what's a<br />\npaper? That led me to think: if<br />\nr's papers they are going to learn to<br />\neen different qualities of writing in a<br />\nn't normally provide a student with. We<br />\nn published literature; we don't provide<br />\nith variety of quality writing so that they can<br />\nthemselves and decide what makes good writing.<br />\nSo I was faced with the problem of how to set up<br />\na peer grading system. Obviously it required that each<br />\npaper has to be anonymous; it really wouldn't be fair to<br />\ntus of have students grading each other's work otherwise. So I<br />\nappropriate have each student hand in a paper with a cover sheet on<br />\nn general I can't it which gives the title and their name. That gets torn<br />\ne sciences that would off and used for keeping track of papers, and each paper<br />\nthat I could imagine one gets numbered. The student will go in and find a grade<br />\nnless it was based upon their sheet or evaluation sheet with their name on it, and that<br />\narch<br />\nsheet specifies the papers they are to grade, by number.<br />\nat do you feel are the most frequent problems (I finally settled on eight papers.) So they read those<br />\nith student writing?<br />\neight papers and try to rank-order them.<br />\nGryder: Frequently there are problems with just the<br />\nWhen I first started this system I asked the<br />\nmechanics punctuation and that sort. The misuse of words students to grade them or give them a numerical grade. I<br />\nwould be my second major complaint. And then struc- found that everybody's grades were clustered<br />\nbetween<br />\nture of the sentences that tend to be the kind of thing about 82 and 92, or they'd all be B+s, Bs, or A-s.<br />\nThat<br />\nthey thought should be in formal writing. Style, I think, stood in stark contrast to what every student<br />\nthat<br />\nis missing.<br />\ncomplained about the system thought. They were<br />\nN-L: You've only been able to implement your ideas on fearful of the system because they were<br />\nsure that in this<br />\n<br />\nHarris Gruman<br />\nWalter Hook<br />\nRobin Johnson<br />\nDayid Newman<br />\nDaisy C. Taylor<br />\n<br />\ncompetitive setting their classmates would do them in.<br />\nAnd what I found instead was that they (students)<br />\nwould have worse grade inflation than the professors.<br />\nSo then there wasn't much of a discrimination. I would<br />\ncurve the grades, and what would happen was students<br />\nwho had given their peers Bs I would curve the grades to<br />\nCs. Then everybody was complaining: well, I gave it a B<br />\nand you gave it a C; that's not fair. So I finally realized<br />\nthat the way to go was to have them rank order the<br />\npapers; almost everybody feels capable of rank ordering<br />\nit.<br />\nI hold the peer grades as being as valid as my<br />\nown. I get the average rank orders, and I curve the<br />\ncourse--a third A, a third B, a third C--which means I<br />\nhave to make a lot of papers on the border (between<br />\ngrades.) Hard decisions have to be made. But one of the<br />\nthings about this process is that, since I then look at t<br />\naverage peer grade, I can spend my time looking at<br />\npapers that fall on the border. I work hard on t<br />\nthat need hard work. I feel like that is an eff<br />\nof my time.<br />\nI wanted the papers rank-ordered<br />\nrange of other papers, not just the clu<br />\njust happened to be mixed with the<br />\nstack. The grade sheet is cleve<br />\nperson grade a random arr<br />\ncourse, so that each<br />\neight different<br />\ncomparing th<br />\nother<br />\nincl.<br />\n<br />\n,I<br />\nlater<br />\nfor each<br />\ne paper. So<br />\ns or comments<br />\n, I had that done<br />\ns that were made were<br />\nrks. I realized that, in fact,<br />\ne anonymous. That has really<br />\nature of the criticism. So now each<br />\ns a grade back and a set of 8 slips from each of<br />\nr evaluators with comments on them.<br />\nI'd like to add that I ask for people to pick their<br />\nown topics. One of the most important parts of scientific research, or any sort of.research, is finding your way<br />\nto the question that you're trying to answer. By not<br />\ntelling my students the topics, they are challenged with<br />\none of the most difficult things about any research. I<br />\nexhort them to go after a problem that really interests<br />\nthem, because I've noticed, that when people do a paper<br />\non something that really interests them, they do a much<br />\nbetter job. Their enthusiasm and excitement about the<br />\nproblem comes right through in the reading, and the<br />\nreader picks it up and likes the paper too.<br />\nN-L: What is it that distinguishes the A papers from the<br />\nB papers?<br />\nCone: I think that an A paper almost always ends up<br />\nbeing the paper which is particularly interesting. It's not<br />\njust well done and clear and well researched (and<br />\nboring). It means that the person developed that question in a way so that I am interested in that question,<br />\nand then somehow conveyed the progress and research<br />\non that question in a way that I was interested in each of<br />\nthe advances.

Along the<br />\nay, you want them to learn how to say it in the most<br />\neffective way. This is part of the fallacy of English<br />\ndepartments being service departments: English departments can teach grammar and rhetoric, but every discipline has its own way of arguing and writing papers.<br />\nNaturally, in English courses you are taught the literarycritical way of putting things, which I happen to think is<br />\na good way, but it is not the only way. It is particularly<br />\nnot effective in writing papers in science of sociology,<br />\nand vice-versa. It is an interesting problem.<br />\nYou know the situation that has arisen-people<br />\ncoming even to prestigious schools like Hopkins with<br />\nvery little background from their high schools or prep<br />\nschools in paperwriting, so there must be more remedial<br />\nwork.<br />\nIt's very hard to take an estimate of it-but in all<br />\nof the classes that I have taught at Hopkins, between<br />\n15% and 20% of the students are what I would call<br />\nmiddle-class illiterate. Sometimes I have had certain<br />\nclasses where there are so many people who are having<br />\nreal trouble that I thought, better than to have two<br />\npapers and an exam, to have by the end of the semester<br />\nsome people just (able to) write out a paragraph, let<br />\nalone a paper. They have gone to good schools; they're<br />\nsmart; but when you read their paper, you don't know<br />\nwhere to begin correcting. That's the thing: teaching<br />\nsomeone how to write a good paper requires something<br />\nto work with. You need to be able to say, \"This is<br />\nwrong,and this would be more effective.\"<br />\nI think it doesn't quite work to have the whole<br />\npaper written out ahead of time and then to write tbe<br />\nwhole paper over again. I think that some more preli<br />\ninary sketch would be better. Having read some o<br />\nrevised papers, I think that virtually every<br />\nacross better the second time. There is a c<br />\ncy in class to take me just as an edi<br />\nreally the point of it. I think tha<br />\nto rethink what they were d \u2022<br />\nbest rewrites were those<br />\nized.<br />\nWhat<br />\nseeing t<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nway to learn how to write papers is to actually hear your<br />\nwords spoken--you begin to see how sentences get<br />\nimpossibly long, and you realize their defects. I often<br />\nencourage people to read their papers out loud, to talk<br />\nthem out because a lot of times it's just not English.<br />\nPeople can speak English, but sometimes when they get<br />\ndown to writing it becomes this very convoluted,strange<br />\nthing because they see writing as another way of talking<br />\nbut not as communication.<br />\nN-L: What factors distinguish an A paper from a B<br />\npaper, and, what distinguishes a publishable paper from<br />\nan A paper?<br />\nBruaudy: The main characteristic of a B paper is to<br />\nmeet the assignment and do a good jcb, a solid job on<br />\nwhat is asked for. An A paper has some undefinable<br />\nflair to it, some wit, some interesting example whicb I<br />\nhad not thought of. It is also one where I the reader am<br />\nmade to think by it, am set off by what the writer has to<br />\nsay, and to do that you must be engaged yourself. You<br />\nwrite with warmth, and then you get more cold-blooded<br />\nwhen you are correcting it. B is workmanlike and<br />\ncompetent; an A is not quite original, because that is<br />\nalmost impossible on the undergraduate level, but that<br />\noriginal means publishable. Publishable means, at<br />\nleast in terms of literary criticism, that you are adding<br />\nsomething to the professional discourse. To me, you<br />\nshouldn't publish something which does not say something different. Undergraduates often have very original<br />\nthoughts just because they don't know what has already<br />\nbeen said. Knowing what has been said can be hampering because it forces you to think in certain lines. I have<br />\nseen a lot of undergraduate papers which have had<br />\noriginal thinking in them, but as papers they weren't<br />\npublishable in the professional world.<br />\nThe only way to learn how to write is to keep on<br />\nwriting. Another aspect of the idea of doing a draft is<br />\nthe pressure taken off the final product. Students just<br />\nget too hung up on that finished product, and sometimes<br />\nthey just don't get hung up enough. People get very<br />\nterrified of the intellectual finished product, and doing<br />\nthe draft is one way of presenting tentative arguments,<br />\nanother way of stepping outside the work. There has to<br />\nbe more of a sense of an audience, that it (the paper) can<br />\nalways be worked on and is never finished, an act of<br />\ncommunication which goes both directions.<br />\n<br />\nlucidly and conne<br />\none goes down a leve<br />\nto meet professional<br />\nhave thought out th<br />\nclearly.

Jack had agreed.<br />\nAlready it is 95\u00b0 and the vinyl is molding itself<br />\nti the back of her legs. She hates the way the sweat<br />\ncollects behind her knees and under her hair at the base<br />\nof her neck. She hates the way that her fingers are<br />\nsticky though she washed her hands before she left the<br />\nhouse. Every day this week was hot, hotter than she has<br />\nfelt for years. The heat makes it hard to think. She<br />\ncloses her eyes against it.<br />\nThey are driving through the suburbs towards the<br />\ncity. That is the only place, Jack says, to get cars. For<br />\nmiles the suburbs are long stretches of fast food places,<br />\ndrive-in movie theaters and low-faced shopping plazas<br />\nwith laundromats and A&P's. And car dealers. That is<br />\nhow roads into the city are and she hates them too.<br />\nThey are coming in from the country, though she<br />\ndoesn't really call it country. A small second-floor<br />\napartment facing a highway towards the city. This<br />\nhighway. The whole town, what there is of it, main lines<br />\non the highway;small wooden frames with tacked-on tar<br />\ngarages pushed up against the gravel shoulders. But<br />\nbehind the houses there is some country: the grass going<br />\nout for a long way until it meets up with shrubs and<br />\ntrees. There are rabbits and such that dart through the<br />\ngrass. Once you've left the highway and houses behind<br />\neverything seems clear and quite country. But their<br />\nhouse isn't much, like the town and all it holds. Some<br />\nof the windows are broken and yellowed plastic is taped<br />\nover the boles. And the screens are ripped or missing<br />\nand the flies and moths and yellow jackets slip in and<br />\nout of tbe stagnant air. She has tried everything to keep<br />\nthe bugs off the food,off the baby's face, off her sweaty<br />\nskin, but nothing much helps when the screens are<br />\nripped.<br />\nIt is so hot. The hotness is all that she can really<br />\nthink about. All that she can focus on. The baby<br />\ndoesn't squirm in the heat. His small sticky head rests<br />\non her lap, his feet curled near Jack's leg. The heat<br />\nmakes her press her fingers against her temples, rubbing<br />\nthem in large circles over and over.

And Harold would be at home every day.<br />\nHe could cook, but it was too hot. He could clean or fix<br />\nthe drips and cracks and the toaster that wouldn't let the<br />\nbread up, but it was too hot. He drank ice tea of lemonade or beer with a few other men and sat on the front<br />\nsteps in his undershirt and shorts. All day he sat there,<br />\nand the sweat dripped from his forehead onto his<br />\nshirt and sopped against his skin. It was so hot.<br />\nIn the city everything circulated the heat. The<br />\nstone steps Harold sat on were no cooler than the<br />\nsidewalks that breathed off ripples of heat. She sat on<br />\nthe floor inside, in front of the black fan. Sometimes<br />\nfriends were there and they played unenergetic, sittingstill games. But other times she was alone and she read<br />\nher mother's magazines.<br />\n\"What are you doing up there?\" Harold called.<br />\n\"Getting into something?\"<br />\n\"No.\"<br />\n\"Making a mess?\"<br />\nThe models in Glamour all wore bathing suits<br />\nand drank tall, icy drinks. The pages stuck together<br />\nfrom the humidity..<br />\nHarold asked her for a new drink or ice or<br />\nsomething every so often, and she'd take it down to<br />\nwhere he sat with his friends.

The heat made him a little crazy sometimes,<br />\n<br />\nelite Yevred<br />\nBY ANDY COE<br />\nA white Rambler stationwagon with a man and a<br />\nwoman in it slowly roared up Route One. Between<br />\nthe, on a mound of tattered maps, rags, and paper from<br />\nfast food restaurants, lay a blanket-wrapped bundle.<br />\nThe Rambler stopped at a red light and stalled. A small<br />\narm pushed the blanket open and bared a red, screamshriveled face. The man pushed the bundle off the<br />\nmound onto the woman's lap. The woman dug a bottle<br />\nout of a cracked vinyl pocketbook and stuck it in<br />\nthe red face. The arm knocked the bottle out of her<br />\nhand. She picked the bottle off the papers on the floor<br />\nand cradled the bundle in her arms. Holding the bottle<br />\nabove the face, she dribbled four drops in the mouth.<br />\nThe face froze, then sputtered the apple juice back at<br />\nher. She rocked the bundle five times and aimed more<br />\njuice into the mouth. The arm reached for the bottle.<br />\nShe slipped it in and stared out the window.<br />\nThe Rambler lurched off Route One into a<br />\nused-car dealier's parking lot, coughed twice, and died.<br />\nThe two climbed out, the woman carrying the bundle.<br />\nThey wended between cars to a 1977 black and silver<br />\nCorvette on a raised platform. While the man peered<br />\nthrough the window at the dashboard, the woman ran<br />\nher hand along the soft lines of the hood. She pressed it<br />\nwith her forefinger, and it gently indented.<br />\nThe dealer emerged from his shack and unlocked<br />\nthe Corvette. The man sat in the driver's seat and turned<br />\nthe wheel and shifted the gears. He stepped out,and the<br />\nwoman gave him the bundle and climbed in. Turning<br />\nthe wheel, she bumped a lever on the steering column.<br />\nShe jumped as water sprayed the windshiled and rubber<br />\nblades wiped it dry. The dealer, the man, and the<br />\nwoman laughed.<br />\nThe dealer gave the keys to the man, and he<br />\nhanded the woman the bundle. She moved over the<br />\n<br />\ngearshift into the passenger seat. The man set himself<br />\nand turned the key. The Corvette stuttered, then roared<br />\nto life. It crawled backward off the platform and rolled<br />\ntwice around the lot at a walk. Then the man drove it<br />\nonto Route One, back and forth in front of the lot.<br />\nAfter a few passes it stopped, and the woman climbed<br />\nout holding the bundle. As soon as the door shut the<br />\ntires squealed, and the Corvette sprinted down the road.<br />\nThe man made it shriek around turns and screeched the<br />\nbrakes. Everytime it dashed by the lot, its horn cried.<br />\nFinally it returned to the lot and crept on the<br />\nplatform. The man stepped smiling out of the car and<br />\nslapped the hood. The man and the woman talked to<br />\nthe dealer. When he pulled out a pen and a paper,they<br />\nshook their heads. They opened the bundle and handed<br />\nthe baby to him. He swung it in the air, and it gurgled.<br />\nHe looked down its throat and prodded the cutting<br />\nteeth with the pen. The baby roared and jerked in his<br />\narms. He traced a long, thin scar on its scalp and looked<br />\nat the man and the woman. The man laughed, talked,<br />\nand shrugged his shoulders. The dealer spread the<br />\nblanket on the Corvette's hood and lay the baby on it.<br />\nStarting at the feet, he bent every joint and poked the<br />\nsmall bruises here and there. He undid its diapers; the<br />\nbaby had soiled itself. The dealer pushed through the<br />\nfeces with the pen.<br />\nFinally he bundled the baby and turned to the<br />\nman and the woman. He shook the man's hand and gave<br />\nhim the keys. The woman jumped and hugged the car.<br />\nThe man stood smiling at the Corvette and his wife. The<br />\ndealer lifted his baby off the hood,and the man and the<br />\nwoman climbed into their car. The engine thumped<br />\ntwice, then roared.

She<br />\ndidn't like the way he kept her off balance on his knee<br />\nor the heat from his arms that touched her.<br />\n\"And you,\" he pointed to one friend \"how much<br />\nwould you give me for her?\"<br />\n\"Don't know.\"<br />\n\"What do you mean, you don't know?\" and<br />\nanother big knowing laugh from Harold. He was joking,<br />\nbut she found the other man's eyes hard to bear, flickering across her.<br />\n\"Let me up.\"<br />\nHarold jiggled her around on his knee.<br />\n\"You don't like sitting on my knee?\"<br />\n\"It's so hot.\"<br />\n\"Well, I can't say she'll be worth much,\" Harold<br />\nchuckled as she climbed the stairs. \"Not like her mother.\" She imagined them all smiling and looking out onto<br />\nthe street in agreement and the heat sealing their faces<br />\nthat way.<br />\nShe watched her mother those nights, stretched<br />\nout in front of the fan in her slip and no nylons. The<br />\nroundness of her body was slicked with heat, her eyes<br />\nclosed against the hot breeze. She wondered how much<br />\nthe roundness could be worth, not knowing, being only<br />\nten years old or so. Now she sits in the car just like her<br />\nmother,\"her head back against the seat and her eyes shut.<br />\nAnd she knows.<br />\nJack drives silently. The baby fusses. He is too<br />\nwet or too dry or too awake. The crying makes Jack<br />\nsquint into the windshield, his fingers tap the steering<br />\nwheel. She picks up the baby. His head snaps back on<br />\nhis shoulders for a moment as it always noes. That<br />\nscares her: how fragile he is'. She props him up with her<br />\nfingers, her clumsy fingers.<br />\n\"There, there,\" she murmurs over and over again<br />\nuntil the soft words buffer the fussing. Gently she<br />\ntouches the skin around the baby's eyes. Tiny blue veins<br />\nshow here and there. Her fingers cannot believe that this<br />\nis skin, so soft.<br />\n\"He all right?\" Jack's voice isn't mean, just a<br />\nlittle tired. The heat makes him this way; she can tell.<br />\nHe sits on the car seat like he hates it, like the rubbing of<br />\nhis jeans against the vinyl is painful. He fusses with his<br />\nhair, brushing it off his forehead.<br />\n\"Yes, he's just hot.\"<br />\nJack doesn't say anything more and the baby<br />\nslips again into a sleep. She wonders how much further,<br />\nbut doesn't ask. They are passing more and more<br />\nparking lots and gas stations. How much time before she<br />\ncan peel her skin from the plastic seat? She doesn't ask.<br />\nThey have needed a new car for a long time. It's<br />\none of those things which you can put off for so long.<br />\nLike screens. Like lawnmowers. But then it becomes<br />\ntoo much and you can't put things off any longer. When<br />\nit got so hot Jack began to talk about new cars. He<br />\nwanted something cool, something you could shut the<br />\nwindows on and still breathe. He told her about it last<br />\nweek and his eyes were bright and flashing around in<br />\nexcitement. A new car would be something you could<br />\nfall into, something soft and so sleek. She had been<br />\nsitting in the living room listening to a fly die in the<br />\nlamp when he told her. That is the way things can<br />\nbegin, just while sitting somewhere quietly. Jack knows<br />\nthe man, an older man, but still not a bad one. A man<br />\nwho knows the worth of things, Jack said, a man who<br />\nhas money.<br />\nHer baby doesn't like the heat any more tban she<br />\ndoes. His breath against her skin is light, sweet panting.<br />\nA beautiful baby, round and satiny, worth so much. He<br />\nwould want a new car too, she thinks, if he knew.<br />\nBut she can only think clearly about the heat.<br />\nThat's how life is, how it has ever been. They need the<br />\ncar, they need a break from the sweat,from the screens<br />\nand taped plastic, from the heat that trickles out of the<br />\nstones on the highway. Then she will be able to think<br />\nabout other things. Her hands close around the tiny<br />\nfists, perfectly wonderful flesh.<br />\n\"How much would you give me for her?\" She<br />\nknows.<br />\nAnd the heat seeps through the glass and makes<br />\nher mouth smile. It will be something you can fall into<br />\nwith its soft seats and cool air. Enough to give so much<br />\nfor, and her fingers caress her baby's skin. He is worth<br />\nthat much.<br />\n<br />\n\fpAGE141ApRiL10,1981<br />\nG.

Stingo, living alone in a<br />\nroom in the officers' club at Camp<br />\nLejeune, North Carolina, is introduced to<br />\nhis new roommate, a young skinheaded<br />\nofficer named Darling P. Jeter, Jr. The<br />\ncontrolled comedy of the ensuing dialogue between the patiently snotty Stingo<br />\nand the quasi-Neanderthal, good-ole-boy<br />\nJeter was accented by Styron's dry<br />\n<br />\ndelivery and his almost actor-perfect<br />\nrendition of a slow,Southern drawl in his<br />\ndepiction of Jeter. Also figuring prominently in the narrative was Jeter's father,<br />\nan ex-Marine and former hell-raiser now<br />\nhampered by chronic bronchitis, full of<br />\nphlegm and high hopes for his son.<br />\nStingo's sensitive characterization of<br />\n\"Stud\" Jeter was one of the high points<br />\nof the passage. Also exceptional were a<br />\nscene in which Stingo reads a letter from<br />\nhis married and slightly kooky lover back<br />\nin New York; and one in which he<br />\ndescribes his alternating terror, joy, and<br />\nanger upon reading a review of his first<br />\nbook (a novel closely paralleling Styron's<br />\nown first book).

The current production at the<br />\nFells Point Theatre, playing Friday,<br />\nSaturday, and Sunday nights through<br />\nApril 26, highlights the script's many<br />\nstrengths as well as its few weaknesses.<br />\nRose wastes little time in plunging<br />\nus into the heart of the story. A 19-yearold boy is charged with murdering his<br />\noften cruel father in their slum apartment. There are two witnesses, so the<br />\ncase is open-and-shut...or is it? One juror(No.8)<br />\ndoesn't think so. Resisting pressure from<br />\n<br />\nmany of the others, he gradually begins<br />\nto persuade some of them. Tempers<br />\noften flare. Piece after piece of the<br />\nprosecution's evidence is somehow discredited, until at the end only one<br />\njuror(No. 3) is left advocating a guilty<br />\nverdict, his position backed by nothing<br />\nbut sheer intransigence.<br />\nAny play about 12 people trying<br />\nto achieve an agreement must depend<br />\nheavily on strong ensemble playing--the<br />\ncast working together crisply and with<br />\nconviction--and from the first awkward<br />\nmoments after the jury enters the room,<br />\nAl Tyler's solid if somewhat conventional<br />\ndirection supplies this necessary ingredient. Such incidents as No. 8 picking up<br />\nhis first convert by secret ballot come<br />\nalive because the rest of the cast reacts-so<br />\nswiftly and so intensely, suggesting just<br />\nhow powerful a force conformity can be.<br />\nThe clear standout among the<br />\nindividual performances is John Walchi's<br />\nbeefy, deep-voiced portrayal of the<br />\nbullheaded, hot-tempered Juror No. 3,<br />\n<br />\nBook As Art Object<br />\ncont.<br />\nt. from P. 14<br />\ncop<br />\nbut defined by reproducibility.<br />\nClever<br />\nmultiple-edition<br />\nwork<br />\nlike<br />\nBorhawn and Layfield's recycled matchbooks, and David Fair's and the Dork<br />\nBrothers' bizarre comic books,appear to<br />\nbe well suited for distribution on a larger<br />\nscale. And most of the unbound works<br />\nbased on Xerography or offset printing<br />\ncould become multiple editions if their<br />\ncreators had the recources. But multipleedition artists' books don't seem to get<br />\nmuch distribution beyond artists' friends<br />\n<br />\nand other artists. While there are some<br />\nstores like Printed Matter in New York<br />\nspecializing in artists' books, it's doubtful<br />\nthat many people outside of a rather<br />\nelite group are buying them. The key to<br />\nchange is better distribution and some<br />\nre-examination of the \"art business.\" If<br />\nartists were to get their books into ordinary stores alongside the comic books and<br />\npaperbacks, the records and T-shirts, the<br />\npublic might get interested. Then the<br />\npotential of artists' books could certainly<br />\nbe realized.<br />\n<br />\nthe chief advocate of conviction. As the<br />\nprospect of a quick guilty verdict slips<br />\naway, Walchi shows us--without the help<br />\nof a single explicit line--that his character<br />\nsees the jury's deliberations as a test of<br />\nhis manhood, a test which he ultimately<br />\nfails. No.3 tries to intimidate the others into<br />\nvoting with him, sometimes succeeding<br />\nbut in the end alienating everyone else in<br />\nthe room. Although he is the villain, we<br />\nwind up pitying him.<br />\nThe other actors range from<br />\nextremely good to merely competent.<br />\nChuck Kandalis nicely avoids the trap of<br />\nmaking No. 8 a cross between an AllAmerican boy and a saint. When No. 3<br />\naccuses No. 8 of baiting him in order to<br />\nmake a point for the defense, one wonders if he's right\u2014which is as it should be,<br />\nsince nobody is completely free of<br />\nmanipulative impulses. Kandalis makes<br />\nsure the audience knows that No. 8 is as<br />\nplagued by doubt as anyone, making the<br />\nline, \"You're all so certain he's guilty-and nothing's that certain\" the core of his<br />\ncharacterization.<br />\nBut Kandalis lacks<br />\nWalchi's force in his overstylized gestures<br />\nand line readings.<br />\nMany of the supporting performances add a lot to the production. John<br />\nRadecke is hilarious as Juror No. 7, a<br />\nbumbling salesman who wants the jury to<br />\nfinish quickly so he can see a baseball<br />\ngame. John Howell nicely underplays his<br />\nrole as a sharp-eyed old man who is the<br />\nfirst to support No. 8 and deals the final<br />\nblow to the prosecution's case. Jim<br />\nBoylan is very convincing as the dithering<br />\nforeman, officious and indecisive at the<br />\nsame time--the responsibilities of leadership are just too much for him.

Although bigotry is<br />\nsupposed to be his most notable character<br />\ntrait, he seems like little more than a pale<br />\ncopy of No. 3 until the moment of<br />\nhis outburst.

Although hampered<br />\nby a slow start this season, the<br />\nmatch \"displayed the team's<br />\ntrue talent\" according to team<br />\ncaptain Walter Cook. Strong<br />\nperformances by<br />\nindividual<br />\nAndy Brief, Les Scorza, Doug<br />\nBaruch, Bill Howard, Rob<br />\nKimmel, and the doubles team<br />\nof Ed Wang and Tony Golden<br />\nanchored the resounding win.<br />\nBrilliant match strategy was<br />\nalso displayed by Ron Gulino,<br />\nRick Foeppel, and Tommy Hsi.<br />\nAfter a disappointing season<br />\nlast year, marked by many<br />\ninjuries, the JHU men's tennis<br />\nteam .is clearly showing the drive<br />\nto reverse last year's record.<br />\nUnder the watchful eye of coach<br />\nRay Santamaria, this year's<br />\nplayers underwent a rigorous<br />\nphysical conditioning program<br />\nduring the winter. Already the<br />\nconditioning has paid off, improving the health of many of<br />\nthe team's perennial basket<br />\ncases. Early-morning practice<br />\nsessions were also held during<br />\nthe winter to sharpen each<br />\nplayer's timing and strokework.<br />\nIn the words of team member<br />\nAndy Brief, \"the enthusiasm of<br />\nCoach Santamaria and Captain<br />\nCook has made the team very<br />\noptimistic and confident for a<br />\nsuccessful season.\"<br />\nCharacterizing this season as<br />\na \"year of rebuilding,\" captain<br />\nCook cites the team's strengths<br />\nas its youth and depth. With<br />\nfour freshmen on the squad, the<br />\nprospects of the team's future<br />\nlook very promising. This year<br />\nonly two seniors\u2014Gulino and<br />\nWand\u2014will be graduating.<br />\nThe team's depth is another<br />\ngreat asset. \"Players frequently<br />\ninterchange positions from bottom to top, indicating near-equal<br />\nability among members of the<br />\nsquad,\" Cook said.<br />\nOne great obstacle to the<br />\n<br />\nteam's championship drive, however, is the tough competition<br />\namong the MAC Division III<br />\nUnlike conference<br />\nschools.<br />\nrivals Haverford and Swarthmore, both nationally-ranked<br />\nteams relying on heavy player<br />\nrecruiting, Hopkins has no such<br />\nprogram to attract top players.<br />\nIn order to overcome such<br />\nhighly touted opponents, Santamaria has placed great emphasis<br />\non \"attitude and development.\"<br />\nEven more optimistic is Cook,<br />\nwho claims that the team can go<br />\non to Nationals as soon as<br />\nScorza learns to volley.<br />\nAnother stumbling block<br />\nfacing the team is the change<br />\nfrom high-school tennis to the<br />\nintercollegiate game. In addition<br />\nto the higher caliber of play in<br />\nthe conference, a no-ad scoring<br />\nsystem is used. This tends to<br />\nplace higher importance on<br />\nindividual points than in the<br />\n<br />\ntraditional scoring system. New<br />\nplayers on the team have frequently voiced their frustration<br />\nwith the no-ad system. However, Doug Baruch, after decimating his Widener opponent<br />\n<br />\nWednesday, said \"I no longer ,<br />\nfeel like a lamb thrown to the I<br />\nwolves.\" Out of the frying pan<br />\nand into the fire, Doug.<br />\nThe team's next home<br />\nmatch will be played Wednes-<br />\n<br />\nTrackmen Improving Steadily<br />\nBY Li.

How will this affect<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University?<br />\n\"Fall of '81 is not going to<br />\nbe very different from fall of'80<br />\nin terms of financial aid,\"<br />\nsaid Hopkins financial aid director Susan Broadbent. \"The<br />\nessence of the proposed cut is a<br />\ngradual withdrawal of federal<br />\nassistance.\"<br />\nIt is difficult to pinpoint<br />\nwhere, if at all, Hopkins will be<br />\nhurt by these budget cuts,<br /><br />\nsince they change from day to<br />\nday. Official word in February<br />\nwas that GSL, presently the only<br />\nform of aid not contingent on<br />\nestablished need, would be limited only to those who could<br /><br />\n161111%.<br />\nAnita Prentice<br /><br />\nSAC:Scheming Politicos Or<br />\nDedicated Boys &amp; Girls?<br />\nBY JOE LEVINE<br />\nLast week, a University<br />\ndean denounced student government as \"a mutual admiration<br />\nsociety with an inflated sense of<br />\nself importance.\"<br />\nA recent<br />\ninterview with Student Council<br />\npresident Michael Steele began<br />\nwith the question,\"Convince me<br />\nthere's a reason that the Council<br />\nshould exist.\" At best, enthusiasm for student representation<br />\nseems low.<br />\nThere is one area, however,<br />\nabout which we still seem to<br />\ncare, if only enough to yell and<br />\ncomplain, and remain eternally<br />\nsuspicious that the job is not<br />\nbeing done as well as it could be.<br />\nThat is the area of extra-curricular activities--the clubs, groups,<br />\nethnic associations, and preprofessional organizations which<br />\nadd at least a small spot of color<br /><br />\nto life at Hopkins--and, of<br />\ncourse, the question of how our<br />\nmoney is being spent on them.<br />\nExtracurricular activities and<br />\ntheir budgets are the responsibility of the Student Activities<br />\nCommission(SAC), and as the<br />\nbudget-setting time for next year<br />\ndraws near, there is some controversy about the members of the<br />\nSAC executive board. Are they<br />\na bunch of scheming student<br />\npoliticos, or just decent, hardworking boys and girls? The<br />\nNews-Letter has made an attempt to answer these and other<br />\nquestions, and also to set the<br />\nrecord straight about some of<br />\nthe basic functions and structure<br />\nof the SAC.<br />\nThe SAC general organization consists of representatives<br />\nfrom 39 student groups, ranging<br />\nfrom the Black Students Association to the Course Guide, the<br /><br />\nEisenhower Symposium, to the<br />\nNews-Letter, and even to the<br />\nStudent Council itself.<br />\nThe<br />\nbudgets of these groups range<br />\nfrom $100 to $12,000, but most<br />\nare at the $3-6000 level. The<br />\ngeneral organization meets twice<br />\neach semester, leaving the bulk<br />\nof the SAC business to be<br />\ncarried on by the seven members<br />\nof the SAC executive board.<br />\nThe Executive Board consists of the Student Council<br />\ntreasurer, who serves as its<br />\nchairman (this year, Susan<br />\nAnderson); the Student Council<br />\nPresident (Michael Steele); the<br />\nadministration's Director of Student Activities, Chris Colombo;<br />\nand four members of the SAC<br />\ngeneral organization, chosen by<br />\ntheir colleagues.<br />\nThe four<br />\nmember elected at the beginning<br />\nof this year were Debby Jeffrey,<br />\ncont on p 2<br /><br />\ndemonstrate need.<br />\nAlso proposed was the elimination of in-school interest<br />\nsubsidies. Presently the Federal<br />\nGovernment is picking up the<br />\ninterest tab, -but in the future<br />\nstudents would be expected to<br />\nmake interest payments while<br />\nstill in school or to defer these<br />\npayments until after school,<br />\nthereby increasing their postgraduation debt by up to 40%.<br />\nThe Administration also<br />\nwants lenders to charge prevailing market interest rates,now at<br />\nmore then 17 percent, on parent<br />\nloans. Presently the rate is set at<br />\n9 percent and the government<br />\nmakes up the difference.<br />\nPell grants would require<br />\nincreased contributions from the<br />\nfamily and the students themselves. The Student Loan Marketing Association would no<br />\nlonger receive federal funds, and<br />\nthe Social Security Benefit Program would be phased out over<br />\nfour years. These proposed cuts<br />\nwould save the government $1.5<br />\nbillion in fiscal year 1982 as well<br />\nas $1.9 billion in unbudgeted<br />\nobligations<br />\nAnita Prentice, Assistant<br />\nDean of Academic Services, said,<br /><br />\nCongressman Long<br />\nSpeaks At Hopkins<br />\nBY MITCHELL SMITH<br />\nClarence Long,D-Md. spoke<br />\nout against increased U.S. military aid to El Salvador in Shriver<br />\nHall Monday night.

As chairman of the<br />\nAppropriations Subcommittee<br />\non Foreign Operations, he felt<br />\nthat it was necessary to be as<br />\nknowledgeable about the Salvadorian situation as possible<br />\nbefore his subcommittee made<br />\nrecommendations to the House<br />\nof Representatives.<br />\nLong said he discovered that<br />\ninvolvement in El Salvador<br />\nwould be \"far more complicated\" than the Reagan administration realizes. He said Salvadorian<br />\npresident<br />\nNapolean<br />\nDuarte and other government<br />\n3fficials neither want nor need<br />\nthe military aid that the administration wants to give them,<br />\nadding that the Salvadorians<br />\nwould prefer economic and<br />\npolitical support from the<br />\nUnited States. Long quoted<br />\nDuarte as saying, \"It is no use in<br />\nhaving (a well-armed) army if<br />\npeople are dying of hunger.\"<br />\nAccording to the congressman,<br />\nEl Salvador has the ability to<br />\ndefeat the- guerilla movement<br />\nbut needs help in revitalizing the<br />\neconomy. \"It is the failure<br />\nof the economy that is leading<br />\nto communism in this country,\"<br />\nclaimed Long, \"not guerilla<br />\nfighting.\"<br />\nLong called the land reform<br />\nprogram of El Salvador \"slow<br />\nand ineffective.\" He claimed<br />\ncont on p 2<br /><br />\nPAGE 2/ APRIL 10, 1981<br /><br />\nBoard A Mixed Bag,Better Than Last Year<br />\ncont from p I<br />\nDana Whitehead, Kevil Duhon,<br />\nand Michael Banton. Banton<br />\nresigned early in the year,<br />\nand the Board operated without<br />\na seventh member until after<br />\nspring break, when it appointed<br />\nLaura Rosenthal.<br />\nThe Board has three main<br />\nfunctions: to award or deny<br />\nSAC-member status and funding<br />\nto new groups; to decide on<br />\nannual budgets for member<br />\ngroups; and to provide financial<br />\nassistance, when necessary, for<br />\nmember groups during the<br />\ncourse of the year. The SAC<br />\ngets the bulk of its money<br />\n($84,000 last year) from the<br />\nbudget of the Dean of Academic<br />\nServices, Joseph Hall. Additional revenues ($6,000 last year)<br />\ncome from the profits of Spring<br />\nFair, and go into an SAC contingency fund for new or financially troubled groups during the<br />\nyear.<br />\nAccording to Chris<br />\nColombo, the Fair finished with<br />\n$12,000 last year, $6,000 of<br />\nwhich was seed money from the<br />\nyear before--hence a $6,000<br />\nprofit. $8,000 of that money<br />\nwas given to the Spring Fair as<br />\nseed money Otis year, while<br />\n$4,000 went to the SAC contingency fund. About two-thirds<br />\nof this fund has been given this<br />\nyear to new or financially<br />\ntroubled groups, and the remaining third has gone back to the<br />\nFair as \"start-up change\" for<br />\nstudent booths.<br />\nComments and criticisms<br />\nabout the SAC Executive Board<br />\nfall into two categories: assessments of this particular Board's<br />\nperformance (1980-81), and<br />\nbroader feelings about the nature of the Board as an institu-<br /><br />\ntion. There seems to be a clear<br />\nconsensus that this year's Board<br />\nis an improvement over last<br />\nyear's. Even Gretchen Luebbe,<br />\npresident of the JHU Band and<br />\non specific matters an outspoken<br />\ncritic of this year's group, says,<br />\n\"There's no question that<br />\nSusan's board is better than the<br />\none under Karl Block (last year's<br />\nchairman). There was no talking<br /><br />\nto Karl past a certain point; he'd<br />\njust turn you off.\"<br />\nDebby Jeffrey, an activity<br />\nrepresentative both this year and<br />\nlast, agrees. \"Last year, you<br />\nwould come in to talk to the<br />\nboard, and they would put you<br />\nall the way down at the other<br />\nend of the conference table like<br />\nthey were sitting in judgement<br />\non you, she says. \"There was<br /><br />\ncone from p I<br />\nthat the use of socialist cooperatives gives the wbrkers no<br />\nincentive for production. He<br />\ncontended that if the people<br />\nwere allowed to own their own<br />\nland, more food would be<br />\nproduced. This would lead to a<br />\nmore efficient capitalistic society, Long said, which would be<br />\nin the best interests of El Salvador. If the U.S. must get involved, he added, we should aid<br />\nthe country in improving its<br />\nagricultural capabilities.<br />\n\"El Salvador has more weapons than they know what to do<br />\nwith,\" Long continued. By<br />\nincreasing arms shipments to this<br />\nnation, he said,the United States<br />\nis upsetting the Central American balance of power. Long<br />\ncontended that of the main<br />\nmotivations for Reagan's insistence on \"pumping arms into El<br />\nSalvador\" is to prove that the<br />\nU.S. is not \"a paper tiger.\" Long<br />\nclaimed that America cannot<br />\ndirectly antagonize the Soviet<br />\nUnion or Cuba, so \"we are<br />\nshowing strength by picking on<br />\ntiny El Salvador.\"<br />\nFollowing the congress-<br /><br />\nman's speech, the Progressive<br />\nStudents Union (PSU) held a<br />\nforum on political repression<br />\nand its link to economic crisis.<br />\nFour speakers spoke before the<br />\n70 people attending the first<br />\nforum organized by the PSU.<br />\nAnthony Robinson, a local attorney working with the Atlanta<br />\nSupport Committee, spoke on<br />\nthe \"rise in racism in the U.S.<br />\nsymbolized by the Atlanta murders.\" Robinson said that until<br />\nthe Atanta child killers are<br />\nfound, one cannot know if it is<br />\na racist event. However,he cited<br />\nracial killings in Buffalo and Salt<br />\nLake Ciyt, the resurgence of the<br />\nKlu Klux Klan and the Nazi<br />\nparty, the election of Ronald<br />\nReagan, and the increase in<br />\npolice brutality as symptoms of<br />\nan increase in racism. He said<br />\nracism historically increases at<br />\nany time there is an economic<br />\ncrisis because the masses look<br />\nfor a scapegoat on which to<br />\nblame the problems. In the<br />\nUnited States today, he contended, those who can least afford<br />\nfunding cuts, such as those in<br />\nCETA and college scholarships,<br />\nare being punished by being<br /><br />\nTerm Papers and Theses<br />\n366-3873<br /><br />\nRepresentative Long<br />\neconomic reasons for<br />\nthe<br />\nUnited States involvement in El<br />\nSalvador, claiming the major<br />\nmotive was to warn other<br />\nnations. She also said U.S.<br />\ncommercial banks loan money<br />\nto foreign nations to cover<br />\ninternational debts and these<br />\ndebts may not be repayed if a<br /><br />\nrevolution occurs. She also<br />\nnoted that by having a friendly<br />\nleader in many countries, the<br />\nUnited States can be sure of<br />\nmaintaining supplies of raw<br />\nmaterials and having markets for<br />\nfinished goods.<br />\nKevin Danaher, a professor<br />\nof Geovernment and Public<br />\nAdministration at American University, spoke next about how<br />\neconomic disparities lead to<br />\nrebelllion.<br />\nHe claimed that<br />\n\"Economic crisis is capitalistic<br />\ncrisis.\" His views on economic<br />\nequality were seconded by Hopkins geography professor David<br />\nHarvey, who contended that the<br />\nU.S. needs to replace corporate<br />\ncapitalism with socialism for the<br />\npoor.<br />\nPSU leader Philip Schmandt<br />\nintroduced the forum, claiming<br />\nthat such symposiums are part<br />\nof a new political awareness at<br />\nJohns Hopkins and throughout<br />\nthe country.

It is not objective reporting to act as little<br />\nmore than a press release; both<br />\nsides of the story need to be<br />\ntold. For instance, the reason<br />\ngiven for the ripoff of student<br />\ngroups is that \"it makes them<br />\noperate more efficiently.\" Apparently a group operates efficiently only when half their<br />\ngross profits after other expenses<br />\nare going to the committee. For<br />\nexample, the JSA has had to<br />\ntake out a loan from the SAC to<br />\npay for their booth; t-e fee was<br />\nalmost as large as their entire<br />\nbudget for, the year.<br />\nThis<br />\nlatest explanation is a new one<br />\nto me. Previously the exorbitant<br /><br />\nfees were excused as paying<br />\nfor expenses. The article states<br />\nthat student fees were 15% of<br />\nthe $40,000 total profit, or<br />\n$6,000.<br />\nWhy couldn't the<br />\nstudent groups be allowed to<br />\nkeep their own money?<br />\nThe truth is that co-chairmen Quinn and Abrams couldn't<br />\ncare less about any of the<br />\nstudent groups making money.<br />\nAs long as the Fair makes a<br />\nprofit, they'll be satisfied, even<br />\nif the student groups lose their<br />\nshirts. As evidence I offer some<br />\nof the actions and statements of<br />\nthese potentates.<br />\nGroups are told that they<br />\nwill have a session to 'negotiate'<br />\ntheir contracts with the Food<br />\nCommittee of the Spring Fair.<br />\nA typical statement from the<br />\nchairman of this committee was<br />\n\"$350.00, take it or leave it.\"<br />\nWhen a complaint was voiced<br />\nover the ridiculously high price,<br />\nthe group was told \"Look, if<br />\nyou don't want it there are<br />\nplenty of outside vendors who<br />\nwould pay a lot more for the<br />\nspace than you, so just be happy<br />\nwe give it to you at all.\" A<br />\nreally understanding negotiating<br />\nstyle: When told that these high<br />\nfees would hurt profits, the<br />\nSpring Fair says \"Raise prices.\"<br />\nThe best statement of all<br />\nwas a Freudian slip by the Food<br />\nCommittee chairman who got<br />\nangry at the criticism he was<br />\ntaking and said \"You people<br />\ncome in here and expect....\"<br />\nThose present had to remind<br />\nhim that student groups don't<br />\n'come in here.' We are already<br />\nhere, remember? Groups that<br />\nwon't roll over and just shut up<br />\nand accept the screwing from<br />\nthe Spring Fair are told publically by Abrams that they are<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nTrouble In Paradise<br /><br />\nOur Reader's Right<br />\ncont.from p. 4<br />\ntroublemakers, and that if they<br />\ndon't just shut up they will be<br />\ndenied a booth next year. Since<br />\nwhen was the Spring Fair a<br />\ndictatorship?<br />\nThis arrogant, dictatorial<br />\nattitude toward anyone who<br />\nprotests the actions of the Hitler<br />\nYouth running the Fair this year<br />\nis totally out of keeping with the<br />\npurpose of the Fair. The main<br />\ngoal shouldn't be 'money,<br />\nmoney, money.' This is supposed to be for the students to<br />\nhave fun and raise some money<br />\nfor their groups. I for one am<br />\nfed up with being abused by the<br />\npower-hungry maniacs that are<br />\nrunning things this year. Why<br />\nisn't the SC looking into the<br />\nhuge fees that students are forced<br />\nto,.pay? Of course, the answer<br />\ngiven is that the money goes to<br />\nthe SAC for distribution to all<br />\ngroups. Well, it is interesting to<br />\nnote that while SAC groups<br />\nhave to count anticipated Spring<br />\nFair revenue in their revenue<br />\nestimates, and therefore get<br />\nless money from the SAC, the<br />\nSAC Executive Board, to whom<br />\nall budgets are submitted, and<br />\nwho parcels out activity money,<br />\nnever even mentioned the<br />\n$15,000 that the News-Letter<br />\narticle seems to imply it received. What happened to all<br />\nthis money? Why is it kept as a<br />\nslush fund and not given out to<br />\nthe SAC groups along with the<br />\nmoney the administration gives<br />\nthem? If the student groups are<br />\nforced to count Spring Fair<br />\nmoney, shouldn't the SAC at<br />\nleast account for this money?<br />\nShouldn't they give it out to the<br />\ngroups who had booths, from<br />\nwhom it was taken in the<br />\nfirst place in enormous fees? I'd<br />\nlike to hear some answers, Mr.<br />\nAbrams, Mr.Colombo.<br />\nI ask that my name not be<br />\npublished because I do not wish<br />\nthe group to which I belong to<br />\nbe retaliated against either by<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board or by<br />\nthe Spring Fair Committee.

The<br />\nsame little comedy played itself<br />\nout a short time later with Harris<br />\nGruman's \"My Dream,\" a story<br />\nwhich critically examined the<br />\nsexual fantasies of a Victorian<br />\ncharacter. The fraternity poster<br />\ncontroversy earlier this semester<br />\nfurther heightened the hilarity.<br />\nMeanwhile, a recent survey<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins Employees Association shows that a<br />\nof Hopkins' female<br />\nthird<br />\noffice workers have experienced<br />\nsome form of sexism on the<br />\njob--sexism which, in many<br />\ncases, prevents these women<br />\nfrom advancing or using their<br />\ntalents to the fullest.

Some blow: all the news<br />\nmedia picked up the story, the<br />\nphotographer was swamped with<br />\ninquiries from women who<br />\nwanted to pose, and Playboy got<br />\nto pose as a martyr to Freedom<br />\nof the Press--a cheap martyrdom<br />\nindeed, because nobody went to<br />\njail protecting his sources or had<br />\nto pay so much as a penny in<br />\nfines.<br />\nBut the anti-Playboy crusade was more than merely<br />\nsilly; it was subtly authoritarian.<br />\nThe editors who refused to sell<br />\nspace to the photographer appointed themselves, in effect, to<br />\nact in loco parentis for their<br />\nfemale readers, protecting the<br />\nLiberated Women Of The Ivy<br />\nLeague from being \"exploited\"<br />\n(i.e., paid a substantial amount<br />\nof money to take off their<br />\nclothes for a few minutes).<br />\nThey assumed that all the<br />\naspiring female doctors, lawyers,,<br />\nscientists, and economists on<br />\ntheir campuses--people who<br />\nhope to take a wide variety of<br />\nleadership positions in American<br />\nsociety\u2014lacked the intelligence,<br />\nmaturity, or judgment to decide for themselves whether to<br /><br />\nThe Loop<br />\nstROA<br />\n(Oril<br />\np60<br /><br />\n:<br /><br />\npose nude.

Now,<br />\nwhile we haven't thrown it all<br />\nthe way open, we exercise less<br />\nstringent controls.\"<br />\nIn the past, the SAC received the groups' itemized<br />\nbudget requests, and crossed off<br />\ndollars in specific areas--in effect<br />\nacting to set the groups' priorities. Now groups are simply<br />\nawarded a set amount, which<br />\nmay or pot be wIlat they requested, and are then allowed to<br />\ndetermine their own priorities.<br />\nThe Board has also made<br />\ntwo internal changes which are,<br />\nat least in theory, beneficial to<br />\nthe activity representatives.<br />\nBoard members have been<br />\nassigned specialized functions in<br />\norder to speed up the paperwork; for example,Jeffrey reads<br />\nall proposed constitutions from<br />\nnew groups, while Kevil Duhon,<br />\nwho is also editor-in-chief of<br />\nEllipsis this year, was in charge<br />\nof ordering the equipment for<br />\nthe publication production room<br />\nset up last semester.<br />\nThe other internal change is<br />\nthat Board members have also<br /><br />\neach taken on a set of individual<br />\noffice hours. \"People coming in<br />\nseemed to have an attitude that<br />\nthey could only get what they<br />\nwanted by talking to me,\" says<br />\nSusan Anderson. \"But other<br />\nBoard members can take care of<br />\nthings, too, and so I think that<br />\nhaving office hours for all of us<br />\nis important.\"<br />\nThere are also some serious<br />\ncriticisms of this year's Executive Board, and perhaps the most<br />\nserious of these center around<br />\nthe members', and specifically<br />\nAnderson's, accessibility and<br />\nattendance at office hours.<br />\nBand president Luebbe says she<br />\nhas tried for as long as a week to<br />\nreach Anderson and been unsuccessful, while the administration's SAC financial coordinator,<br />\nBeth Newcombe, has also complained of her inability to meet<br />\nconsistently with Anderson.<br />\nOne student, Wayne Kimball,<br />\nwho was attempting to start a<br />\nmodel United Nations organization at Hopkins, says Anderson's<br />\ninaccessability prevented him<br />\nfrom starting the group in time<br />\nfor a model U.N. conference this<br />\nmonth, despite the fact that he<br />\nfirst approached her at the end<br />\nof last semester.<br />\nAnderson's reply to these<br />\ncharges is that she has kept her<br />\noffice hous faithfully all year.<br />\n\"I have two office hours a<br />\nweek, and if you come in at<br />\nanother time, it may seem to<br />\nyou that I'm never here,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"It bothers me that people<br />\nexpect me to treat this as a<br />\nfull-time job. I do take the job<br />\nseriously, but I'm not a full-time<br />\nemployee--no student can be. I<br />\nthink that is why it is probably<br />\nhistorically a complaint that the<br />\nSAC chairman can't be found.\"<br />\nRegarding the Kimball incident, Anderson says she told<br /><br />\ntOet,talii&amp;Wanda-14<br /><br />\nKimball that in her judgement,<br />\nhe was better off seeking funding through other channels. \"In<br />\nretrospect, I think he took it as<br />\ndiscouragement, which is not<br />\nhow it was meant,\" she said.<br />\nAnother criticism of this<br />\nyear's Board is that it acted too<br />\nslowly in filling its vacancy<br />\nand proceeded unfairly by filling<br />\nthe vacancy in the manner in<br />\nwhich it ultimately did. Laura<br />\nRosenthal, the recently appointed seventh member, applied for<br />\ntbe job after a candidate deadline had passed and two other<br />\napplicants had submitted their<br />\nnames. One of these first two<br />\napplicants was Gretchen Luebbe,<br />\nwho has often been critical of<br />\nthe Board.<br />\n\"We didn't fill that position<br />\nuntil now because our workload<br />\ndidn't require it, and because<br />\nthere is no constitutional mandate which says that we have to<br />\nfill it,\" Anderson said. \"I<br />\ndecided of my own volition that<br />\nwe should fill it because I knew<br />\nthat we would ultimately need<br />\nsomeone else, even just to share<br />\nin the general legwork.\"<br />\nAnderson says she decided<br />\nto extend the candidate deadline<br />\nwhen she realized that there<br />\nwere several other qualified<br />\npeople who were interested.<br />\n\"I though perhaps that<br />\ncommunications had been poor,<br />\nas they often are among student<br />\ngroups,\" she said. She denies<br />\nthat the SAC general membership was unaware of the move<br />\nhave<br />\nmembers<br />\nsome<br />\n(as<br />\ncharged), saying she' announced<br />\nit at general meeting in March.<br />\n\"Of course, there weren't a<br />\nlot of people at that meeting,<br />\nbut that's usually the case,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nFinally, activity representatives say that Executive Board<br /><br />\nmeetings are not regularly scheduled, and are usually poorly<br />\npublicized.<br />\n\"I agree with that criticism,\" says Board member<br />\nJeffrey. \"I'd like to see a regular<br />\nschedule and agenda, as much<br />\nfor us as for anyone else. But<br />\nthe problem is that we set<br />\nmeetings up around people's<br />\nschedules. We had set them up<br />\nto accomodate Mike Banton, but<br />\nthen he quit. Now we've adjust.<br />\ned for Laura, and in between<br />\nthere was a semester change. So<br />\nit's difficult.\"<br />\nBoth Anderson and Jeffrey<br />\nin summing up their response to<br />\ncomplaints made against this<br />\nparticular Board, say that one<br />\nhandicap the Board has had to<br />\ndeal with is the legacy of last<br />\nyear's Board.<br />\n\"They left no coherent<br />\nrecords, so organizationally we<br />\ngot off to a slow start,\"<br />\nAnderson says. \"And I think<br />\npeople automatically feel they're<br />\ndealing with last year's Board,<br />\nand that we're the enemy,and it<br />\ntakes a lot to overcome that.\"<br />\nApart from their feelings<br />\nabout this year's Board, some<br />\nmembers are unhappy with the<br />\ngeneral structure and impact of<br />\nthe Board from year to year.<br />\nOne complaint is. that Director<br />\nof Student Services Chris<br />\nColombo, the administration's<br />\nrepresentative on the Board, has<br />\noften had the effect of \"coopting\" and \"coercing\" the student<br />\nofficers into agreement with his<br />\nviewpoint.<br />\n',My feeling is that he tries<br />\nto come across as if he were<br />\nsaying 'it's up to the Board,<br />\ntalk to Sue or Michael,'but that<br />\nwhat really happens is that what<br />\nChris says goes,\" said one<br />\nwho<br />\nrepresentative<br />\nactivity<br />\nasked not to be named. \"If he<br /><br />\nfeels one way,then the other six<br />\nend up voting that way.\"<br />\nThe representative claimed<br />\nto have heard of instances in<br />\nwhich Colombo had decided tie<br />\nBoard votes by saying that his<br />\nvote counted as more than one.<br />\nHowever, both Colombo and the<br />\nBoard members deny that he has<br />\never acted coercively; further,<br />\nthey say that there has not been<br />\na tie vote all year, and that<br />\nCalombo's vote counts no more<br />\nor less than that of any of the<br />\nother members--that, if anyone's<br />\nvote could break a tie, it would<br />\nbe Anderson's.<br />\n\"My position is simply that<br />\nof being one of the seven Board<br />\nmembers,\" Colombo says. \"The<br />\nother members have often voted<br />\nagainst me. It's annoying to<br />\nhear this misconception, because<br />\nhistorically, students have voted<br />\nagainst the administrator's viewpoint. I wish whoever said<br />\nthis would come talk to me.\"<br />\nAnderson says of Colombo<br />\nthat \"he has maintained a very<br />\nlow-key profile on the Board.<br />\nHe'll clarify things for us, and<br />\nhe's mostly been a resource<br />\nwhich we've been glad to use,<br />\nbut I can't ever remember him<br />\nstating his opinion unless I've<br />\nasked him. It's true that as<br />\nDirector of Student Services, not<br />\nas a Board member, he could put<br />\na halt to anything he felt was<br />\nwrong, but he's never used that<br />\npower as far as I know.\"<br />\nJeffrey describes Colombo<br />\nas \"conservative financially, and<br />\ncautious from experience, but<br />\nnot a strongarm type\u2014any excess<br />\npower he has beyond a oneseventh share is a result of our<br />\ntrust and confidence in his<br />\njudgment?'<br />\nShe says Colombo is conservative about things such as<br />\ncentp. 9<br /><br />\nThe Office of the Cha lain Proudl Presents its Annual<br /><br />\nDog Show<br />\nThe Dogs of Hopkins '81<br />\nLevering Hall Patio<br />\nSunday, April 12<br /><br />\nP.O.

The<br />\nFTX began at noon Friday,<br />\nApril 3 and ended at about<br />\n4:00 p.m. Sunday, .Apri15.<br />\nAlthough many cadets do not<br />\nchoose to be infantry officers,<br />\nopting instead for Service Support branches of the Army<br />\n(like the Medical Corps), the<br />\nFTX improves the cadets'<br />\nchances of doing well at<br />\nAdvanced Camp, which each<br />\nfuture officer must attend and<br />\npass during the summer between his or her junior and<br />\nsenior years.<br />\nAfter being assigned to<br />\none of two platoons and issued<br />\nfour C-rations, a weapon (the<br />\nM-16 or the M-60 machine<br />\ngun) and two boxes of blank<br />\nammunition (among other<br />\nthings) the cadets boarded<br />\nbuses and were taken to Fort<br />\nMeade. After brief classes on<br />\nindividual soldiering skills radio<br /><br />\noperations and squad tactics,<br />\nthe cadets were led by newly<br />\ndesignated cadet leaders to<br />\ntheir respective Night Defensive Positions (NDP's). At each<br />\nNDP, the platoons were ambushed by members of an<br />\naggressor force (predominantly<br />\nmade up of freshmen Ranger<br />\ncadets), then settled down for<br />\na delicious (???) C-ration dinner. After dinner there was<br />\ninstruction on how to dog a<br />\ndefensive position (popularly<br />\nknown as a foxhole). Next,<br />\nthe cadets were paired off by a<br />\nnew set of cadet leaders and<br />\nassigned a place to dig a<br />\ndefensive position. Although<br />\nnone of the holes were armpitlevel depth, as specified by the<br />\nArmy, the camoflauged defensive positions came in handy<br />\nlater that evening when the<br />\naggressor<br />\nforce<br />\nattacked.<br />\nAfterwards, the cadets unrolled<br />\ntheir sleeping bags and slept<br />\nunder the stars.<br />\nLeadership positions were<br />\nconstantly being changed to<br />\ngive each cadet a chance to<br />\nmake mistakes, and, in the<br />\nprocess, learn a great deal.<br />\nTactical situations were set up<br />\nSaturday to offer the cadet<br />\nleaders constructive criticism<br />\non their decisiveness, enthusiasm, knowledge, confidence,<br />\nability to communicate with<br />\ntheir subordinates, and performace under pressure.<br />\nOn Sunday, the two platoons were issued scopes for<br />\ntheir M-16's and numbered<br />\ncloth covers for their helmets.<br />\nWith these added items, the<br /><br />\ncadets were exposed to a more<br />\nrealistic battle situation, since<br />\nthose who exposed themselves<br />\nto the enemy long enough to<br />\nhave their numbers recognized<br />\nwere exposed long enough to<br />\nbe shot. Some cadets realized<br />\nthey had a lot to learn despite<br />\na weekend in the woods, while<br />\nother cadets demonstrated the<br />\nvalue of good camoflauge by<br />\nthoroughly plastering their<br />\nnumbers with mud and leaves.<br />\nAnother highlight of the<br />\nFTX was the hot meal served<br />\nSaturday night. Although the<br />\nfood might have been even<br />\nworse than that served in the<br />\ndorm cafeteria, and an occasional pine needle found its<br />\nway into the mashed potatoes,<br /><br />\na meal from Danny's couldn's<br />\nhave done more for the morale.<br />\nLater Saturday night (and<br />\nwell into Sunday morning) one<br />\nof the night patrols found use<br />\nfor tbis newly found morale.<br />\nAfter maneuvring through<br />\nbriars, and marching on overgrown dirt road,the \"Northern<br />\nParkway Patrol\" began to<br />\ncomb the woods for the enemy<br />\nNight<br />\nDefensive Position.<br />\nAfter a period of searching,the<br />\npatrol open-fired on the trees<br />\nand let out enthusiastic battle<br />\ncries, hoping to stir something<br />\nup.

Eventually the<br />\nPatrol stumbled on Northern<br /><br />\nParkway, but unfortunately<br />\nlost radio contact with the rest<br />\nof the ROTC detachment. The<br />\npatrol finally returned to camp<br />\nat 5:00 a.m., just in time for<br />\nbreakfast.<br />\nOn Sunday afternoon, the<br />\ncadets cleaned their weapons<br />\nand, at last, were dismissed to<br />\ngo home to showers and beds.<br />\nIf, while you are studying in<br />\nthe Hut, you happen to notice<br />\nsomeone covered with scratches, and, perhaps, still sporting<br />\ngreen camoflauge coloring behind his ears, ask about the<br />\nFTX.

Perhaps what's needed<br />\nis a way of implementing it on a bigger scale, with large<br />\nclasses.<br />\nGryder: Well, on the bigger scale you have to rely on<br />\ngraders. The use of the English language has been going<br />\ndownhill for some time. Reading graduate student<br />\ntheses is an interesting endeavor at times also and they<br />\nwould be the ones doing the grading<br />\nI really<br />\ndo see problems with trying to approach it on a large<br />\nscale, in a large class.<br />\nRICHARD CONE(BIOPHYSICS)<br /><br />\nN-L: I'd like you to describe the peer grading system<br />\nyou've developed for science majors.<br />\nCone: I started working on the peer grading method for<br />\nevaluating papers in the course about eight years ago<br />\nwhen I first started teaching physiology, because when I<br />\nmade it a general introductory course in physiology,<br />\nabout 270 students applied and I didn't have any teaching assistants. Yet I wanted the students, instead of<br />\nhaving exams, quizzes or final exams, to be evaluated in<br />\nthe course by how well they could write papers on<br />\nscientific topics. So this peer grading method came out<br />\nof (the question of) how to fairly evaluate a large<br />\nnumber of papers.<br />\nOne of the first things I realized is that in a large<br />\ncourse, it becomes a very boring procedure to read paper<br />\nafter paper and try to evaluate them. In fact, I found<br />\nthat after I had read about 10 papers<br />\nI would<br />\nalready begin to get bored, but that I could do a goo<br />\njob on 8 or 9 or<br />\n10 papers. So I started t<br />\nis there a way in which everybody could e<br />\nthing like 10 papers, and thereby ha<br />\nthe course evaluated by fresh m<br />\nbetter way to evaluate a pape<br />\nthe peers in the course eval<br />\nI realized that if<br />\nthe challenge was to w<br />\nmates instead of t<br />\npaper for the pr<br />\nchanges a lot.<br />\ncal material<br />\nmost scien<br />\npapers ar<br />\nany ti<br />\nore<br />\nclear<br />\ns more<br />\nim<br />\na paper well<br />\novides) exactly<br />\ng to write a good<br />\nship, but they know<br />\nis really writing for a<br /><br />\nelieve they could evaluate<br />\n1 feeling: \"Well, how can I<br />\nt you can turn that question<br />\nn I expect a student to write a<br />\n't discriminate between what's a<br />\npaper? That led me to think: if<br />\nr's papers they are going to learn to<br />\neen different qualities of writing in a<br />\nn't normally provide a student with. We<br />\nn published literature; we don't provide<br />\nith variety of quality writing so that they can<br />\nthemselves and decide what makes good writing.<br />\nSo I was faced with the problem of how to set up<br />\na peer grading system. Obviously it required that each<br />\npaper has to be anonymous; it really wouldn't be fair to<br />\ntus of have students grading each other's work otherwise. So I<br />\nappropriate have each student hand in a paper with a cover sheet on<br />\nn general I can't it which gives the title and their name. That gets torn<br />\ne sciences that would off and used for keeping track of papers, and each paper<br />\nthat I could imagine one gets numbered. The student will go in and find a grade<br />\nnless it was based upon their sheet or evaluation sheet with their name on it, and that<br />\narch<br />\nsheet specifies the papers they are to grade, by number.<br />\nat do you feel are the most frequent problems (I finally settled on eight papers.) So they read those<br />\nith student writing?<br />\neight papers and try to rank-order them.<br />\nGryder: Frequently there are problems with just the<br />\nWhen I first started this system I asked the<br />\nmechanics punctuation and that sort. The misuse of words students to grade them or give them a numerical grade. I<br />\nwould be my second major complaint. And then struc- found that everybody's grades were clustered<br />\nbetween<br />\nture of the sentences that tend to be the kind of thing about 82 and 92, or they'd all be B+s, Bs, or A-s.<br />\nThat<br />\nthey thought should be in formal writing. Style, I think, stood in stark contrast to what every student<br />\nthat<br />\nis missing.<br />\ncomplained about the system thought. They were<br />\nN-L: You've only been able to implement your ideas on fearful of the system because they were<br />\nsure that in this<br /><br />\nHarris Gruman<br />\nWalter Hook<br />\nRobin Johnson<br />\nDayid Newman<br />\nDaisy C. Taylor<br /><br />\ncompetitive setting their classmates would do them in.<br />\nAnd what I found instead was that they (students)<br />\nwould have worse grade inflation than the professors.<br />\nSo then there wasn't much of a discrimination. I would<br />\ncurve the grades, and what would happen was students<br />\nwho had given their peers Bs I would curve the grades to<br />\nCs. Then everybody was complaining: well, I gave it a B<br />\nand you gave it a C; that's not fair. So I finally realized<br />\nthat the way to go was to have them rank order the<br />\npapers; almost everybody feels capable of rank ordering<br />\nit.<br />\nI hold the peer grades as being as valid as my<br />\nown. I get the average rank orders, and I curve the<br />\ncourse--a third A, a third B, a third C--which means I<br />\nhave to make a lot of papers on the border (between<br />\ngrades.) Hard decisions have to be made. But one of the<br />\nthings about this process is that, since I then look at t<br />\naverage peer grade, I can spend my time looking at<br />\npapers that fall on the border. I work hard on t<br />\nthat need hard work. I feel like that is an eff<br />\nof my time.<br />\nI wanted the papers rank-ordered<br />\nrange of other papers, not just the clu<br />\njust happened to be mixed with the<br />\nstack. The grade sheet is cleve<br />\nperson grade a random arr<br />\ncourse, so that each<br />\neight different<br />\ncomparing th<br />\nother<br />\nincl.<br /><br />\n,I<br />\nlater<br />\nfor each<br />\ne paper. So<br />\ns or comments<br />\n, I had that done<br />\ns that were made were<br />\nrks. I realized that, in fact,<br />\ne anonymous. That has really<br />\nature of the criticism. So now each<br />\ns a grade back and a set of 8 slips from each of<br />\nr evaluators with comments on them.<br />\nI'd like to add that I ask for people to pick their<br />\nown topics. One of the most important parts of scientific research, or any sort of.research, is finding your way<br />\nto the question that you're trying to answer. By not<br />\ntelling my students the topics, they are challenged with<br />\none of the most difficult things about any research. I<br />\nexhort them to go after a problem that really interests<br />\nthem, because I've noticed, that when people do a paper<br />\non something that really interests them, they do a much<br />\nbetter job. Their enthusiasm and excitement about the<br />\nproblem comes right through in the reading, and the<br />\nreader picks it up and likes the paper too.<br />\nN-L: What is it that distinguishes the A papers from the<br />\nB papers?<br />\nCone: I think that an A paper almost always ends up<br />\nbeing the paper which is particularly interesting. It's not<br />\njust well done and clear and well researched (and<br />\nboring). It means that the person developed that question in a way so that I am interested in that question,<br />\nand then somehow conveyed the progress and research<br />\non that question in a way that I was interested in each of<br />\nthe advances.

Along the<br />\nay, you want them to learn how to say it in the most<br />\neffective way. This is part of the fallacy of English<br />\ndepartments being service departments: English departments can teach grammar and rhetoric, but every discipline has its own way of arguing and writing papers.<br />\nNaturally, in English courses you are taught the literarycritical way of putting things, which I happen to think is<br />\na good way, but it is not the only way. It is particularly<br />\nnot effective in writing papers in science of sociology,<br />\nand vice-versa. It is an interesting problem.<br />\nYou know the situation that has arisen-people<br />\ncoming even to prestigious schools like Hopkins with<br />\nvery little background from their high schools or prep<br />\nschools in paperwriting, so there must be more remedial<br />\nwork.<br />\nIt's very hard to take an estimate of it-but in all<br />\nof the classes that I have taught at Hopkins, between<br />\n15% and 20% of the students are what I would call<br />\nmiddle-class illiterate. Sometimes I have had certain<br />\nclasses where there are so many people who are having<br />\nreal trouble that I thought, better than to have two<br />\npapers and an exam, to have by the end of the semester<br />\nsome people just (able to) write out a paragraph, let<br />\nalone a paper. They have gone to good schools; they're<br />\nsmart; but when you read their paper, you don't know<br />\nwhere to begin correcting. That's the thing: teaching<br />\nsomeone how to write a good paper requires something<br />\nto work with. You need to be able to say, \"This is<br />\nwrong,and this would be more effective.\"<br />\nI think it doesn't quite work to have the whole<br />\npaper written out ahead of time and then to write tbe<br />\nwhole paper over again. I think that some more preli<br />\ninary sketch would be better. Having read some o<br />\nrevised papers, I think that virtually every<br />\nacross better the second time. There is a c<br />\ncy in class to take me just as an edi<br />\nreally the point of it. I think tha<br />\nto rethink what they were d \u2022<br />\nbest rewrites were those<br />\nized.<br />\nWhat<br />\nseeing t<br />\nthe<br /><br />\nway to learn how to write papers is to actually hear your<br />\nwords spoken--you begin to see how sentences get<br />\nimpossibly long, and you realize their defects. I often<br />\nencourage people to read their papers out loud, to talk<br />\nthem out because a lot of times it's just not English.<br />\nPeople can speak English, but sometimes when they get<br />\ndown to writing it becomes this very convoluted,strange<br />\nthing because they see writing as another way of talking<br />\nbut not as communication.<br />\nN-L: What factors distinguish an A paper from a B<br />\npaper, and, what distinguishes a publishable paper from<br />\nan A paper?<br />\nBruaudy: The main characteristic of a B paper is to<br />\nmeet the assignment and do a good jcb, a solid job on<br />\nwhat is asked for. An A paper has some undefinable<br />\nflair to it, some wit, some interesting example whicb I<br />\nhad not thought of. It is also one where I the reader am<br />\nmade to think by it, am set off by what the writer has to<br />\nsay, and to do that you must be engaged yourself. You<br />\nwrite with warmth, and then you get more cold-blooded<br />\nwhen you are correcting it. B is workmanlike and<br />\ncompetent; an A is not quite original, because that is<br />\nalmost impossible on the undergraduate level, but that<br />\noriginal means publishable. Publishable means, at<br />\nleast in terms of literary criticism, that you are adding<br />\nsomething to the professional discourse. To me, you<br />\nshouldn't publish something which does not say something different. Undergraduates often have very original<br />\nthoughts just because they don't know what has already<br />\nbeen said. Knowing what has been said can be hampering because it forces you to think in certain lines. I have<br />\nseen a lot of undergraduate papers which have had<br />\noriginal thinking in them, but as papers they weren't<br />\npublishable in the professional world.<br />\nThe only way to learn how to write is to keep on<br />\nwriting. Another aspect of the idea of doing a draft is<br />\nthe pressure taken off the final product. Students just<br />\nget too hung up on that finished product, and sometimes<br />\nthey just don't get hung up enough. People get very<br />\nterrified of the intellectual finished product, and doing<br />\nthe draft is one way of presenting tentative arguments,<br />\nanother way of stepping outside the work. There has to<br />\nbe more of a sense of an audience, that it (the paper) can<br />\nalways be worked on and is never finished, an act of<br />\ncommunication which goes both directions.<br /><br />\nlucidly and conne<br />\none goes down a leve<br />\nto meet professional<br />\nhave thought out th<br />\nclearly.

Jack had agreed.<br />\nAlready it is 95\u00b0 and the vinyl is molding itself<br />\nti the back of her legs. She hates the way the sweat<br />\ncollects behind her knees and under her hair at the base<br />\nof her neck. She hates the way that her fingers are<br />\nsticky though she washed her hands before she left the<br />\nhouse. Every day this week was hot, hotter than she has<br />\nfelt for years. The heat makes it hard to think. She<br />\ncloses her eyes against it.<br />\nThey are driving through the suburbs towards the<br />\ncity. That is the only place, Jack says, to get cars. For<br />\nmiles the suburbs are long stretches of fast food places,<br />\ndrive-in movie theaters and low-faced shopping plazas<br />\nwith laundromats and A&amp;P's. And car dealers. That is<br />\nhow roads into the city are and she hates them too.<br />\nThey are coming in from the country, though she<br />\ndoesn't really call it country. A small second-floor<br />\napartment facing a highway towards the city. This<br />\nhighway. The whole town, what there is of it, main lines<br />\non the highway;small wooden frames with tacked-on tar<br />\ngarages pushed up against the gravel shoulders. But<br />\nbehind the houses there is some country: the grass going<br />\nout for a long way until it meets up with shrubs and<br />\ntrees. There are rabbits and such that dart through the<br />\ngrass. Once you've left the highway and houses behind<br />\neverything seems clear and quite country. But their<br />\nhouse isn't much, like the town and all it holds. Some<br />\nof the windows are broken and yellowed plastic is taped<br />\nover the boles. And the screens are ripped or missing<br />\nand the flies and moths and yellow jackets slip in and<br />\nout of tbe stagnant air. She has tried everything to keep<br />\nthe bugs off the food,off the baby's face, off her sweaty<br />\nskin, but nothing much helps when the screens are<br />\nripped.<br />\nIt is so hot. The hotness is all that she can really<br />\nthink about. All that she can focus on. The baby<br />\ndoesn't squirm in the heat. His small sticky head rests<br />\non her lap, his feet curled near Jack's leg. The heat<br />\nmakes her press her fingers against her temples, rubbing<br />\nthem in large circles over and over.

And Harold would be at home every day.<br />\nHe could cook, but it was too hot. He could clean or fix<br />\nthe drips and cracks and the toaster that wouldn't let the<br />\nbread up, but it was too hot. He drank ice tea of lemonade or beer with a few other men and sat on the front<br />\nsteps in his undershirt and shorts. All day he sat there,<br />\nand the sweat dripped from his forehead onto his<br />\nshirt and sopped against his skin. It was so hot.<br />\nIn the city everything circulated the heat. The<br />\nstone steps Harold sat on were no cooler than the<br />\nsidewalks that breathed off ripples of heat. She sat on<br />\nthe floor inside, in front of the black fan. Sometimes<br />\nfriends were there and they played unenergetic, sittingstill games. But other times she was alone and she read<br />\nher mother's magazines.<br />\n\"What are you doing up there?\" Harold called.<br />\n\"Getting into something?\"<br />\n\"No.\"<br />\n\"Making a mess?\"<br />\nThe models in Glamour all wore bathing suits<br />\nand drank tall, icy drinks. The pages stuck together<br />\nfrom the humidity..<br />\nHarold asked her for a new drink or ice or<br />\nsomething every so often, and she'd take it down to<br />\nwhere he sat with his friends.

Between<br />\nthe, on a mound of tattered maps, rags, and paper from<br />\nfast food restaurants, lay a blanket-wrapped bundle.<br />\nThe Rambler stopped at a red light and stalled. A small<br />\narm pushed the blanket open and bared a red, screamshriveled face. The man pushed the bundle off the<br />\nmound onto the woman's lap. The woman dug a bottle<br />\nout of a cracked vinyl pocketbook and stuck it in<br />\nthe red face. The arm knocked the bottle out of her<br />\nhand. She picked the bottle off the papers on the floor<br />\nand cradled the bundle in her arms. Holding the bottle<br />\nabove the face, she dribbled four drops in the mouth.<br />\nThe face froze, then sputtered the apple juice back at<br />\nher. She rocked the bundle five times and aimed more<br />\njuice into the mouth. The arm reached for the bottle.<br />\nShe slipped it in and stared out the window.<br />\nThe Rambler lurched off Route One into a<br />\nused-car dealier's parking lot, coughed twice, and died.<br />\nThe two climbed out, the woman carrying the bundle.<br />\nThey wended between cars to a 1977 black and silver<br />\nCorvette on a raised platform. While the man peered<br />\nthrough the window at the dashboard, the woman ran<br />\nher hand along the soft lines of the hood. She pressed it<br />\nwith her forefinger, and it gently indented.<br />\nThe dealer emerged from his shack and unlocked<br />\nthe Corvette. The man sat in the driver's seat and turned<br />\nthe wheel and shifted the gears. He stepped out,and the<br />\nwoman gave him the bundle and climbed in. Turning<br />\nthe wheel, she bumped a lever on the steering column.<br />\nShe jumped as water sprayed the windshiled and rubber<br />\nblades wiped it dry. The dealer, the man, and the<br />\nwoman laughed.<br />\nThe dealer gave the keys to the man, and he<br />\nhanded the woman the bundle. She moved over the<br /><br />\ngearshift into the passenger seat. The man set himself<br />\nand turned the key. The Corvette stuttered, then roared<br />\nto life. It crawled backward off the platform and rolled<br />\ntwice around the lot at a walk. Then the man drove it<br />\nonto Route One, back and forth in front of the lot.<br />\nAfter a few passes it stopped, and the woman climbed<br />\nout holding the bundle. As soon as the door shut the<br />\ntires squealed, and the Corvette sprinted down the road.<br />\nThe man made it shriek around turns and screeched the<br />\nbrakes. Everytime it dashed by the lot, its horn cried.<br />\nFinally it returned to the lot and crept on the<br />\nplatform. The man stepped smiling out of the car and<br />\nslapped the hood. The man and the woman talked to<br />\nthe dealer. When he pulled out a pen and a paper,they<br />\nshook their heads. They opened the bundle and handed<br />\nthe baby to him. He swung it in the air, and it gurgled.<br />\nHe looked down its throat and prodded the cutting<br />\nteeth with the pen. The baby roared and jerked in his<br />\narms. He traced a long, thin scar on its scalp and looked<br />\nat the man and the woman. The man laughed, talked,<br />\nand shrugged his shoulders. The dealer spread the<br />\nblanket on the Corvette's hood and lay the baby on it.<br />\nStarting at the feet, he bent every joint and poked the<br />\nsmall bruises here and there. He undid its diapers; the<br />\nbaby had soiled itself. The dealer pushed through the<br />\nfeces with the pen.<br />\nFinally he bundled the baby and turned to the<br />\nman and the woman. He shook the man's hand and gave<br />\nhim the keys. The woman jumped and hugged the car.<br />\nThe man stood smiling at the Corvette and his wife. The<br />\ndealer lifted his baby off the hood,and the man and the<br />\nwoman climbed into their car. The engine thumped<br />\ntwice, then roared.

He was joking,<br />\nbut she found the other man's eyes hard to bear, flickering across her.<br />\n\"Let me up.\"<br />\nHarold jiggled her around on his knee.<br />\n\"You don't like sitting on my knee?\"<br />\n\"It's so hot.\"<br />\n\"Well, I can't say she'll be worth much,\" Harold<br />\nchuckled as she climbed the stairs. \"Not like her mother.\" She imagined them all smiling and looking out onto<br />\nthe street in agreement and the heat sealing their faces<br />\nthat way.<br />\nShe watched her mother those nights, stretched<br />\nout in front of the fan in her slip and no nylons. The<br />\nroundness of her body was slicked with heat, her eyes<br />\nclosed against the hot breeze. She wondered how much<br />\nthe roundness could be worth, not knowing, being only<br />\nten years old or so. Now she sits in the car just like her<br />\nmother,\"her head back against the seat and her eyes shut.<br />\nAnd she knows.<br />\nJack drives silently. The baby fusses. He is too<br />\nwet or too dry or too awake. The crying makes Jack<br />\nsquint into the windshield, his fingers tap the steering<br />\nwheel. She picks up the baby. His head snaps back on<br />\nhis shoulders for a moment as it always noes. That<br />\nscares her: how fragile he is'. She props him up with her<br />\nfingers, her clumsy fingers.<br />\n\"There, there,\" she murmurs over and over again<br />\nuntil the soft words buffer the fussing. Gently she<br />\ntouches the skin around the baby's eyes. Tiny blue veins<br />\nshow here and there. Her fingers cannot believe that this<br />\nis skin, so soft.<br />\n\"He all right?\" Jack's voice isn't mean, just a<br />\nlittle tired. The heat makes him this way; she can tell.<br />\nHe sits on the car seat like he hates it, like the rubbing of<br />\nhis jeans against the vinyl is painful. He fusses with his<br />\nhair, brushing it off his forehead.<br />\n\"Yes, he's just hot.\"<br />\nJack doesn't say anything more and the baby<br />\nslips again into a sleep. She wonders how much further,<br />\nbut doesn't ask. They are passing more and more<br />\nparking lots and gas stations. How much time before she<br />\ncan peel her skin from the plastic seat? She doesn't ask.<br />\nThey have needed a new car for a long time. It's<br />\none of those things which you can put off for so long.<br />\nLike screens. Like lawnmowers. But then it becomes<br />\ntoo much and you can't put things off any longer. When<br />\nit got so hot Jack began to talk about new cars. He<br />\nwanted something cool, something you could shut the<br />\nwindows on and still breathe. He told her about it last<br />\nweek and his eyes were bright and flashing around in<br />\nexcitement. A new car would be something you could<br />\nfall into, something soft and so sleek. She had been<br />\nsitting in the living room listening to a fly die in the<br />\nlamp when he told her. That is the way things can<br />\nbegin, just while sitting somewhere quietly. Jack knows<br />\nthe man, an older man, but still not a bad one. A man<br />\nwho knows the worth of things, Jack said, a man who<br />\nhas money.<br />\nHer baby doesn't like the heat any more tban she<br />\ndoes. His breath against her skin is light, sweet panting.<br />\nA beautiful baby, round and satiny, worth so much. He<br />\nwould want a new car too, she thinks, if he knew.<br />\nBut she can only think clearly about the heat.<br />\nThat's how life is, how it has ever been. They need the<br />\ncar, they need a break from the sweat,from the screens<br />\nand taped plastic, from the heat that trickles out of the<br />\nstones on the highway. Then she will be able to think<br />\nabout other things. Her hands close around the tiny<br />\nfists, perfectly wonderful flesh.<br />\n\"How much would you give me for her?\" She<br />\nknows.<br />\nAnd the heat seeps through the glass and makes<br />\nher mouth smile. It will be something you can fall into<br />\nwith its soft seats and cool air. Enough to give so much<br />\nfor, and her fingers caress her baby's skin. He is worth<br />\nthat much.<br /><br />\npAGE141ApRiL10,1981<br />\nG.

Jeter, Jr. The<br />\ncontrolled comedy of the ensuing dialogue between the patiently snotty Stingo<br />\nand the quasi-Neanderthal, good-ole-boy<br />\nJeter was accented by Styron's dry<br /><br />\ndelivery and his almost actor-perfect<br />\nrendition of a slow,Southern drawl in his<br />\ndepiction of Jeter. Also figuring prominently in the narrative was Jeter's father,<br />\nan ex-Marine and former hell-raiser now<br />\nhampered by chronic bronchitis, full of<br />\nphlegm and high hopes for his son.<br />\nStingo's sensitive characterization of<br />\n\"Stud\" Jeter was one of the high points<br />\nof the passage.

The current production at the<br />\nFells Point Theatre, playing Friday,<br />\nSaturday, and Sunday nights through<br />\nApril 26, highlights the script's many<br />\nstrengths as well as its few weaknesses.<br />\nRose wastes little time in plunging<br />\nus into the heart of the story. A 19-yearold boy is charged with murdering his<br />\noften cruel father in their slum apartment. There are two witnesses, so the<br />\ncase is open-and-shut...or is it? One juror(No.8)<br />\ndoesn't think so. Resisting pressure from<br /><br />\nmany of the others, he gradually begins<br />\nto persuade some of them. Tempers<br />\noften flare. Piece after piece of the<br />\nprosecution's evidence is somehow discredited, until at the end only one<br />\njuror(No. 3) is left advocating a guilty<br />\nverdict, his position backed by nothing<br />\nbut sheer intransigence.<br />\nAny play about 12 people trying<br />\nto achieve an agreement must depend<br />\nheavily on strong ensemble playing--the<br />\ncast working together crisply and with<br />\nconviction--and from the first awkward<br />\nmoments after the jury enters the room,<br />\nAl Tyler's solid if somewhat conventional<br />\ndirection supplies this necessary ingredient. Such incidents as No. 8 picking up<br />\nhis first convert by secret ballot come<br />\nalive because the rest of the cast reacts-so<br />\nswiftly and so intensely, suggesting just<br />\nhow powerful a force conformity can be.<br />\nThe clear standout among the<br />\nindividual performances is John Walchi's<br />\nbeefy, deep-voiced portrayal of the<br />\nbullheaded, hot-tempered Juror No. 3,<br /><br />\nBook As Art Object<br />\ncont.<br />\nt. from P. 14<br />\ncop<br />\nbut defined by reproducibility.<br />\nClever<br />\nmultiple-edition<br />\nwork<br />\nlike<br />\nBorhawn and Layfield's recycled matchbooks, and David Fair's and the Dork<br />\nBrothers' bizarre comic books,appear to<br />\nbe well suited for distribution on a larger<br />\nscale. And most of the unbound works<br />\nbased on Xerography or offset printing<br />\ncould become multiple editions if their<br />\ncreators had the recources. But multipleedition artists' books don't seem to get<br />\nmuch distribution beyond artists' friends<br /><br />\nand other artists. While there are some<br />\nstores like Printed Matter in New York<br />\nspecializing in artists' books, it's doubtful<br />\nthat many people outside of a rather<br />\nelite group are buying them. The key to<br />\nchange is better distribution and some<br />\nre-examination of the \"art business.\" If<br />\nartists were to get their books into ordinary stores alongside the comic books and<br />\npaperbacks, the records and T-shirts, the<br />\npublic might get interested. Then the<br />\npotential of artists' books could certainly<br />\nbe realized.<br /><br />\nthe chief advocate of conviction. As the<br />\nprospect of a quick guilty verdict slips<br />\naway, Walchi shows us--without the help<br />\nof a single explicit line--that his character<br />\nsees the jury's deliberations as a test of<br />\nhis manhood, a test which he ultimately<br />\nfails. No.3 tries to intimidate the others into<br />\nvoting with him, sometimes succeeding<br />\nbut in the end alienating everyone else in<br />\nthe room. Although he is the villain, we<br />\nwind up pitying him.<br />\nThe other actors range from<br />\nextremely good to merely competent.<br />\nChuck Kandalis nicely avoids the trap of<br />\nmaking No. 8 a cross between an AllAmerican boy and a saint. When No. 3<br />\naccuses No. 8 of baiting him in order to<br />\nmake a point for the defense, one wonders if he's right\u2014which is as it should be,<br />\nsince nobody is completely free of<br />\nmanipulative impulses. Kandalis makes<br />\nsure the audience knows that No. 8 is as<br />\nplagued by doubt as anyone, making the<br />\nline, \"You're all so certain he's guilty-and nothing's that certain\" the core of his<br />\ncharacterization.<br />\nBut Kandalis lacks<br />\nWalchi's force in his overstylized gestures<br />\nand line readings.<br />\nMany of the supporting performances add a lot to the production. John<br />\nRadecke is hilarious as Juror No. 7, a<br />\nbumbling salesman who wants the jury to<br />\nfinish quickly so he can see a baseball<br />\ngame. John Howell nicely underplays his<br />\nrole as a sharp-eyed old man who is the<br />\nfirst to support No. 8 and deals the final<br />\nblow to the prosecution's case. Jim<br />\nBoylan is very convincing as the dithering<br />\nforeman, officious and indecisive at the<br />\nsame time--the responsibilities of leadership are just too much for him. Ron<br />\nMalfara, as the upper-crusty stockbroker<br />\nwho is the most rational advocate of<br /><br />\nconviction (a character Rose included to<br />\navoid stacking the deck too much), starts<br />\nout a bit wimpy but gains strength as the<br />\nperformance goes on; when he ends<br />\nJuror No. 10's bigoted outburst late in<br />\nthe second act by quietly telling him,\"If<br />\nyou say one more word I will split<br />\nyour face open,\" he provides the funniest<br />\nmoment of the evening.<br />\nHowever, Juror No. 10 is something of a problem.

Although hampered<br />\nby a slow start this season, the<br />\nmatch \"displayed the team's<br />\ntrue talent\" according to team<br />\ncaptain Walter Cook. Strong<br />\nperformances by<br />\nindividual<br />\nAndy Brief, Les Scorza, Doug<br />\nBaruch, Bill Howard, Rob<br />\nKimmel, and the doubles team<br />\nof Ed Wang and Tony Golden<br />\nanchored the resounding win.<br />\nBrilliant match strategy was<br />\nalso displayed by Ron Gulino,<br />\nRick Foeppel, and Tommy Hsi.<br />\nAfter a disappointing season<br />\nlast year, marked by many<br />\ninjuries, the JHU men's tennis<br />\nteam .is clearly showing the drive<br />\nto reverse last year's record.<br />\nUnder the watchful eye of coach<br />\nRay Santamaria, this year's<br />\nplayers underwent a rigorous<br />\nphysical conditioning program<br />\nduring the winter. Already the<br />\nconditioning has paid off, improving the health of many of<br />\nthe team's perennial basket<br />\ncases. Early-morning practice<br />\nsessions were also held during<br />\nthe winter to sharpen each<br />\nplayer's timing and strokework.<br />\nIn the words of team member<br />\nAndy Brief, \"the enthusiasm of<br />\nCoach Santamaria and Captain<br />\nCook has made the team very<br />\noptimistic and confident for a<br />\nsuccessful season.\"<br />\nCharacterizing this season as<br />\na \"year of rebuilding,\" captain<br />\nCook cites the team's strengths<br />\nas its youth and depth.

This year<br />\nonly two seniors\u2014Gulino and<br />\nWand\u2014will be graduating.<br />\nThe team's depth is another<br />\ngreat asset. \"Players frequently<br />\ninterchange positions from bottom to top, indicating near-equal<br />\nability among members of the<br />\nsquad,\" Cook said.<br />\nOne great obstacle to the<br /><br />\nteam's championship drive, however, is the tough competition<br />\namong the MAC Division III<br />\nUnlike conference<br />\nschools.<br />\nrivals Haverford and Swarthmore, both nationally-ranked<br />\nteams relying on heavy player<br />\nrecruiting, Hopkins has no such<br />\nprogram to attract top players.<br />\nIn order to overcome such<br />\nhighly touted opponents, Santamaria has placed great emphasis<br />\non \"attitude and development.\"<br />\nEven more optimistic is Cook,<br />\nwho claims that the team can go<br />\non to Nationals as soon as<br />\nScorza learns to volley.<br />\nAnother stumbling block<br />\nfacing the team is the change<br />\nfrom high-school tennis to the<br />\nintercollegiate game. In addition<br />\nto the higher caliber of play in<br />\nthe conference, a no-ad scoring<br />\nsystem is used. This tends to<br />\nplace higher importance on<br />\nindividual points than in the<br /><br />\ntraditional scoring system. New<br />\nplayers on the team have frequently voiced their frustration<br />\nwith the no-ad system. However, Doug Baruch, after decimating his Widener opponent<br /><br />\nWednesday, said \"I no longer ,<br />\nfeel like a lamb thrown to the I<br />\nwolves.\" Out of the frying pan<br />\nand into the fire, Doug.<br />\nThe team's next home<br />\nmatch will be played Wednes-<br /><br />\nTrackmen Improving Steadily<br />\nBY Li.
