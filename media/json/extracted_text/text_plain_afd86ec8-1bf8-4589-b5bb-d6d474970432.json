We say that the attendance was surprising;<br />\nonly a year ago for the same event three people and the judges<br />\nconstituted the audience.<br />\nThe debating boom is not to be taken without a grain of<br />\nthe proverbial salt. The crowd, the program, the entire success<br />\nof the event rested upon the shoulders of one man. To him the<br />\nDebating Council delegated the arduous job of getting an<br />\naudience out to listen to the debaters' shouts. It seems to us<br />\nthat he performed the task extremely well, and the NEWS-LETTER wants to call the attention of the campus to the fact. Mr.<br />\nA. Risley Ensor will now take the curtain calls.<br />\n<br />\nSTRAYING FROM THE PATH<br />\nAs-gad- as it may seem -Hopkins undergraduate activities<br />\nare in danger of straying from the path of simon pure amateurism. For years it has been the boast of Hopkins men that<br />\nthe eligibility rules of the University were so strict that any<br />\nman who represented any activity in any way was a bona fide<br />\nundergraduate in good academic standing.<br />\nAlas, the times have changed. We went to the Musical<br />\nClub concert on Friday night all set for the good old college<br />\nparty. We sat through the 'harmony of the Glee Club, we<br />\ncheered for the Banjo Club, we applauded heartily for the<br />\nvarious soloists, we wept tears of delight when Rodgers and<br />\nhis \"Russian Boys\" gave their Bolshevist love song. All was<br />\nwell thus far.<br />\nAnd then came the anti-climax. The Blue Jay Orchestra<br />\nwas good, unexpectedly excellent, but in their midst sat two<br />\nor three men who were not Hopkins students; in fact they<br />\nprobably had never seen the inside of any college building.<br />\nIt seems to us that this is straying from the old straight<br />\nand narrow eligibility road. Would not an orchestra completely made up of Hopkins men be advisable, for the concerts<br />\nof the Musical Club at least, even if the music furnished was<br />\nslightly inferior? We think so.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS FIFTH MEET<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n* *<br />\nSilence!<br />\nby H.

AND L.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n+I+<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from p. 1, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nDonald Niles now took the.platform for Hopkins, giving the economic reasons in favor of recognition. First, Russia is economically stable, he explained. -Eco'nomically, which is to say basically, a country's foundations are<br />\nbuilt upon the economic bonds that<br />\nit it-self weaves.\"<br />\nNiles introduced his second<br />\npoint with There is a vast field<br />\nin Russia for investment of American capital and the United States<br />\nneeds a foreign field in which to<br />\ninvest capital.\" The Hopkins debater showed that recognition<br />\nwould open new- fields for commercial prosperity. After proving<br />\nthat the Russian exports to the<br />\n-United States have been increasing; Niles cleverly stated, -A<br />\nhealthy organism grows under bad<br />\nconditions,,but that does not justify bad conditions.\"<br />\nVisitor Gives Challenge<br />\n<br />\nCharles W. Lowry,. Jr. spoke<br />\nnext for the negative. In a welltoned voice, the Washington and<br />\nLee debater showed that Russia<br />\nhas not fulfilled the requisites necessary to recognition of a de jure<br />\ngovernment. \"I challenge my opponents to show an actual repudiation of Communist principles<br />\nsince 1918.\"<br />\nLowry continued, -The United<br />\nStates is morally bound to refuse<br />\nrecognition, because the Soviet<br />\ngovernment is a minority government. * * Human life is a 'cheap<br />\ncommodity in Russia. * * Those<br />\nwho deny freedom to others do<br />\nnot deserve it themselves.\"<br />\nThe rebuttals were spirited and<br />\nit was here that the Hopkins debaters excelled. If their main<br />\nspeeches had equalled their rebuttals, it is believed that the decision would have gone to Hopkins.<br />\nAn unusual feature- of the debate was the presence of a number of Russians who showed intense interest in the discussion.<br />\nThe judges were Dr.. Wilbur<br />\nSmith, Dr. C. T. Heatwole, and<br />\nMr. E. J. Rutt. Dr. John C.<br />\nFrench presided.<br />\n<br />\nA. A.

The<br />\nvalue of June Week in increasing<br />\nthe prestige of the University in a<br />\nsocial way, was the subject of his<br />\ntalk.

We say that the attendance was surprising;<br />\nonly a year ago for the same event three people and the judges<br />\nconstituted the audience.<br />\nThe debating boom is not to be taken without a grain of<br />\nthe proverbial salt. The crowd, the program, the entire success<br />\nof the event rested upon the shoulders of one man. To him the<br />\nDebating Council delegated the arduous job of getting an<br />\naudience out to listen to the debaters' shouts. It seems to us<br />\nthat he performed the task extremely well, and the NEWS-LETTER wants to call the attention of the campus to the fact. Mr.<br />\nA. Risley Ensor will now take the curtain calls.<br /><br />\nSTRAYING FROM THE PATH<br />\nAs-gad- as it may seem -Hopkins undergraduate activities<br />\nare in danger of straying from the path of simon pure amateurism. For years it has been the boast of Hopkins men that<br />\nthe eligibility rules of the University were so strict that any<br />\nman who represented any activity in any way was a bona fide<br />\nundergraduate in good academic standing.<br />\nAlas, the times have changed. We went to the Musical<br />\nClub concert on Friday night all set for the good old college<br />\nparty. We sat through the 'harmony of the Glee Club, we<br />\ncheered for the Banjo Club, we applauded heartily for the<br />\nvarious soloists, we wept tears of delight when Rodgers and<br />\nhis \"Russian Boys\" gave their Bolshevist love song. All was<br />\nwell thus far.<br />\nAnd then came the anti-climax. The Blue Jay Orchestra<br />\nwas good, unexpectedly excellent, but in their midst sat two<br />\nor three men who were not Hopkins students; in fact they<br />\nprobably had never seen the inside of any college building.<br />\nIt seems to us that this is straying from the old straight<br />\nand narrow eligibility road. Would not an orchestra completely made up of Hopkins men be advisable, for the concerts<br />\nof the Musical Club at least, even if the music furnished was<br />\nslightly inferior? We think so.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS FIFTH MEET<br /><br />\n*<br />\n* *<br />\nSilence!<br />\nby H.

First, Russia is economically stable, he explained. -Eco'nomically, which is to say basically, a country's foundations are<br />\nbuilt upon the economic bonds that<br />\nit it-self weaves.\"<br />\nNiles introduced his second<br />\npoint with There is a vast field<br />\nin Russia for investment of American capital and the United States<br />\nneeds a foreign field in which to<br />\ninvest capital.\" The Hopkins debater showed that recognition<br />\nwould open new- fields for commercial prosperity. After proving<br />\nthat the Russian exports to the<br />\n-United States have been increasing; Niles cleverly stated, -A<br />\nhealthy organism grows under bad<br />\nconditions,,but that does not justify bad conditions.\"<br />\nVisitor Gives Challenge<br /><br />\nCharles W. Lowry,. Jr. spoke<br />\nnext for the negative. In a welltoned voice, the Washington and<br />\nLee debater showed that Russia<br />\nhas not fulfilled the requisites necessary to recognition of a de jure<br />\ngovernment. \"I challenge my opponents to show an actual repudiation of Communist principles<br />\nsince 1918.\"<br />\nLowry continued, -The United<br />\nStates is morally bound to refuse<br />\nrecognition, because the Soviet<br />\ngovernment is a minority government. * * Human life is a 'cheap<br />\ncommodity in Russia. * * Those<br />\nwho deny freedom to others do<br />\nnot deserve it themselves.\"<br />\nThe rebuttals were spirited and<br />\nit was here that the Hopkins debaters excelled. If their main<br />\nspeeches had equalled their rebuttals, it is believed that the decision would have gone to Hopkins.<br />\nAn unusual feature- of the debate was the presence of a number of Russians who showed intense interest in the discussion.<br />\nThe judges were Dr..

He<br />\nran a pretty race, but he missed<br />\nthe objective by two-thirds of a<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe 1926 games witnessed .two<br />\nbroken world's records and one<br />\ntied record.

To do<br />\nthis the high school lad had to<br />\nconsign Pugh of Maryland to third<br />\nplace and relegate the Richmond<br />\nCollege entry, who ran second the<br />\ngreater part of the race, to an<br />\nignonimous fourth.<br />\nThe meet was crammed full of<br />\nthrilling incidents from start to<br />\nfinish. Johns Hopkins, although<br />\nit did not exactly cover itself<br />\nwith glory, had a good cause to<br />\nbe proud of. Prospects look<br />\nbright for the coming\u2022 outdoor<br />\nseason.
