The<br />\ncourses offered were in history, moral philosophy, jurisprudence and mathematics. Besides, the arts of medicine, soothsaying, almanac making, writing and painting were introduced from time to time. Many young<br />\nmen were also sent by the government to<br />\nstudy abroad. Later on, about four or five<br />\nhundred years ago, the political condition of<br />\nthe country had changed entirely, and the<br />\ncountry was divided up into so many petty<br />\nprincipalities, whose heads were, although<br />\nnominally subject to the throne of the one and<br />\nthe same everlasting royal family, continually<br />\nengaged in warfare among each other, and<br />\nwho had no leisure to pay attention to the cultivation of art and science. Then, the education passed into the hands of Buddhist monks,<br />\nand the higher culture was only preserved<br />\nwithin the Buddhist temples. About three<br />\nhundred years ago, with the unification of the<br />\ncountry under the royal sovereignty, schools<br />\nand seminaries were again established everywhere, and the education of the sons and<br />\ndaughters of the nobles and warriors was<br />\ngiven, not only in the peaceful art and literature, but also in military drills. Indeed, the<br />\nart of fencing was the most prominent task in<br />\nthese seminaries. In the meanwhile the sons<br />\nand daughters of merchants and peasants continued to get education through the Buddhist<br />\nmonks. Thus my readers will be prepared to<br />\nunderstand how the religion (Buddhism) and<br />\nthe education were so intimately interwoven<br />\namong the merchants and peasants, and how<br />\nthe warlike spirit and the belles-lettres were<br />\nso inseparably amalgamated and developed<br />\ninto the spirit of the chivalry which we are so<br />\n<br />\nNo. 3<br />\n<br />\nproud of' and which we call the \"Yamatodamashie.\"<br />\nIn this connection, it may not be uninteresting to quote what that great Commodore<br />\nPerry says in p. 58 of the introduction to his<br />\nreport of the United States Japan Expedition:<br />\n\"Xavier says that in his day there were four<br />\nacademies in or near Miako (Kyoto), each<br />\nhaving between three and four thousand pupils; and he adds that much larger numbers<br />\nwere taught at an institution near the city of<br />\nBandone, and that such seminaries were universal throughout the empire. There would<br />\nseem to be something like a common school<br />\nsystem, for Meylau states that children of both<br />\nsexes and of all ranks are invariably sent to<br />\nrudimentary schools. Here the pupils are all<br />\ntaught to read and write, and are initiated into<br />\nsome knowledge of the history of their own<br />\ncountry. This much the meanest peasant<br />\nchild is expected to learn. There are immense<br />\nnumbers of cheap, easy books continually issuing from the Japanese press. Books innumerable of a higher order are provided for<br />\nthe rich, and all, of both kinds, are profusely<br />\nillustrated with wood cuts. So that in our<br />\nmodern inventions of stereotyping and printing in colors, and in our manufacture of cheap<br />\nliterature for the people generally, Japan has<br />\nanticipated us by centuries. Reading is a favorite occupation with both sexes; and it is<br />\nsaid to be common in Japan to see, when the<br />\nweather permits, a group of ladies and gentlemen seated by a cool running stream, or in a<br />\nshady grove, each with a book.\"<br />\nIn regard to this last point, I must say that<br />\nhalf a century ago, when ,Commodore Perry<br />\nvisited my country, ladies and gentlemen may<br />\nhave had such a fine time together. Today,<br />\nhowever, the society does not permit a college<br />\nyoung man and a college young lady to walk<br />\ntogether by a happy running stream, or to<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nramble together in a dreamy, shaded grove.<br />\nExcepting the primary public schools, there is<br />\nalmost no co-educational school at present.<br />\nSo far as my knowledge goes, the only coeducational institution of high rank is Dr.<br />\nHasegawa's Medical College in Tokyo. Beyond the age of fifteen, the girls and the boys<br />\nare temporarily and forcibly separated from<br />\neach other. Each sex goes by itself its own<br />\nway, and there is apparently a great abyss<br />\nlying between these two realms until the ceremony of the \"turtle and crane,\" and of the<br />\n\"pine-bamboo-and-plum-blossom\" heals the<br />\nabyss and \"gives forth a good tune by pairing<br />\nthe coarse with the tender and the strong with<br />\nthe mild.\" In my alma mater, the Doshish<br />\nUniversity of Kyoto, there are college and<br />\ngraduate departments for boys, and Girls' Department and Nurses' School, which is connected with a hospital. The boys' department<br />\nis separated from the girls' by several hundred<br />\nyards of the intervening space, which is occupied by resident 'houses. There is no communication for week days between these two<br />\nartificially separated realms. But lo! every<br />\nSunday morning, at a quarter of nine, there<br />\ncomes a long procession of fair maidens, one<br />\nto three hundred in number, winding their<br />\nway along the wall of the old time-honored<br />\nImperial Palace. Listen to the echo of their<br />\nlightly-treaded, velvet-matted, hollow-clogs<br />\nmade of pavlonia imperialis. Hearken to the<br />\nchirping and the murmuring of these \"girlscholars\" (for we do not say school girls, but<br />\n\"she-scholars\" or \"girl-scholars\"). They are<br />\ncoming for the morning service at our church!<br />\nThey enter the church, take their seats together by themselves in the eastern wing.<br />\nThen the boys come in pell-mell and take<br />\ntheir seats anywhere they can find, without<br />\nany rule and without any order, but most<br />\nscrupulously avoiding the girls' pews. And<br />\neo things go on.<br />\nThe third of November brings around annually the great national holiday for celebration of the Emperor's Birthday. This also<br />\n<br />\nbrings the \"Arbor Day\" for the public school<br />\nchildren. The boys of my alma mater keep<br />\non this day a great boat race on the Lake<br />\nBiwa, the largest lake of the country. The<br />\nstudents of all the colleges in the neighborhood are invited and requested to send champions for the intercollegiate race as the climax<br />\nof the day. And here, also, you notice a<br />\ngroup of fair maidens of the Doshisha Girls'<br />\nDepartment and the Nurses' School, seated<br />\non the best point of the promontory, headed<br />\nby the widow of late President Neesiiima, and<br />\nsmiting over their brethrens' enthusiastic combatting with other rival colleges. But these<br />\nmaidens are mute; to talk is for them to blush;<br />\nonly they may from time to time send prizes<br />\nto the winners.<br />\nBeside boat rowing, baseball is also just as<br />\nmuch popular among college students. But<br />\nall these are purely voluntary games in contradistinction from the compulsory military<br />\ndrill of four hours a week. After being graduated from these colleges, they must still fulfill one year's military service, after which<br />\nthey get the rank of second lieutenant of the<br />\nlandwehr. Then they are left free either to<br />\ncontinue in military service or to pursue ordinary civil life. Thus the combination of<br />\nwarlike occupation and literary study, which<br />\nwas existing in Old Japan in a so grotesque<br />\nscale, is now being revived, compelled by the<br />\ninternational relations of New Japan, under a<br />\nbetter form. The habit of college students of<br />\nJapan is very rough and coarse, and they ut \u2022<br />\nterly lack the refined gentlemanliness of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins students. The emphasis laid<br />\non the military drill tends to make them combative, and it is not infrequent that a whole<br />\nclass combines in a \"strike,\" as they call it,<br />\nand refuse to attend a certain unpopular professor's recitation, thus compelling the trustees to dismiss that particular professor.<br />\nThe greatest defect in Japanese college<br />\nstudents' life is, however, the total absence of<br />\nthe healthy, refining and uplifting influence of<br />\nnoble Christian manhood and womanhood.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nBOOK NOTES.<br />\nTHE DAY'S WORK.<br />\nRUDYARD KIPLING.<br />\n<br />\nWe have toiled with Mr. Kipling so far up<br />\nthe hill, that we refuse indignantly to allow<br />\nhim to set his face in any wise but toward the<br />\ntop.

The<br />\ncourses offered were in history, moral philosophy, jurisprudence and mathematics. Besides, the arts of medicine, soothsaying, almanac making, writing and painting were introduced from time to time. Many young<br />\nmen were also sent by the government to<br />\nstudy abroad. Later on, about four or five<br />\nhundred years ago, the political condition of<br />\nthe country had changed entirely, and the<br />\ncountry was divided up into so many petty<br />\nprincipalities, whose heads were, although<br />\nnominally subject to the throne of the one and<br />\nthe same everlasting royal family, continually<br />\nengaged in warfare among each other, and<br />\nwho had no leisure to pay attention to the cultivation of art and science. Then, the education passed into the hands of Buddhist monks,<br />\nand the higher culture was only preserved<br />\nwithin the Buddhist temples. About three<br />\nhundred years ago, with the unification of the<br />\ncountry under the royal sovereignty, schools<br />\nand seminaries were again established everywhere, and the education of the sons and<br />\ndaughters of the nobles and warriors was<br />\ngiven, not only in the peaceful art and literature, but also in military drills. Indeed, the<br />\nart of fencing was the most prominent task in<br />\nthese seminaries. In the meanwhile the sons<br />\nand daughters of merchants and peasants continued to get education through the Buddhist<br />\nmonks. Thus my readers will be prepared to<br />\nunderstand how the religion (Buddhism) and<br />\nthe education were so intimately interwoven<br />\namong the merchants and peasants, and how<br />\nthe warlike spirit and the belles-lettres were<br />\nso inseparably amalgamated and developed<br />\ninto the spirit of the chivalry which we are so<br /><br />\nNo. 3<br /><br />\nproud of' and which we call the \"Yamatodamashie.\"<br />\nIn this connection, it may not be uninteresting to quote what that great Commodore<br />\nPerry says in p. 58 of the introduction to his<br />\nreport of the United States Japan Expedition:<br />\n\"Xavier says that in his day there were four<br />\nacademies in or near Miako (Kyoto), each<br />\nhaving between three and four thousand pupils; and he adds that much larger numbers<br />\nwere taught at an institution near the city of<br />\nBandone, and that such seminaries were universal throughout the empire. There would<br />\nseem to be something like a common school<br />\nsystem, for Meylau states that children of both<br />\nsexes and of all ranks are invariably sent to<br />\nrudimentary schools. Here the pupils are all<br />\ntaught to read and write, and are initiated into<br />\nsome knowledge of the history of their own<br />\ncountry. This much the meanest peasant<br />\nchild is expected to learn. There are immense<br />\nnumbers of cheap, easy books continually issuing from the Japanese press. Books innumerable of a higher order are provided for<br />\nthe rich, and all, of both kinds, are profusely<br />\nillustrated with wood cuts. So that in our<br />\nmodern inventions of stereotyping and printing in colors, and in our manufacture of cheap<br />\nliterature for the people generally, Japan has<br />\nanticipated us by centuries. Reading is a favorite occupation with both sexes; and it is<br />\nsaid to be common in Japan to see, when the<br />\nweather permits, a group of ladies and gentlemen seated by a cool running stream, or in a<br />\nshady grove, each with a book.\"<br />\nIn regard to this last point, I must say that<br />\nhalf a century ago, when ,Commodore Perry<br />\nvisited my country, ladies and gentlemen may<br />\nhave had such a fine time together. Today,<br />\nhowever, the society does not permit a college<br />\nyoung man and a college young lady to walk<br />\ntogether by a happy running stream, or to<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nramble together in a dreamy, shaded grove.<br />\nExcepting the primary public schools, there is<br />\nalmost no co-educational school at present.<br />\nSo far as my knowledge goes, the only coeducational institution of high rank is Dr.<br />\nHasegawa's Medical College in Tokyo. Beyond the age of fifteen, the girls and the boys<br />\nare temporarily and forcibly separated from<br />\neach other. Each sex goes by itself its own<br />\nway, and there is apparently a great abyss<br />\nlying between these two realms until the ceremony of the \"turtle and crane,\" and of the<br />\n\"pine-bamboo-and-plum-blossom\" heals the<br />\nabyss and \"gives forth a good tune by pairing<br />\nthe coarse with the tender and the strong with<br />\nthe mild.\" In my alma mater, the Doshish<br />\nUniversity of Kyoto, there are college and<br />\ngraduate departments for boys, and Girls' Department and Nurses' School, which is connected with a hospital. The boys' department<br />\nis separated from the girls' by several hundred<br />\nyards of the intervening space, which is occupied by resident 'houses. There is no communication for week days between these two<br />\nartificially separated realms. But lo! every<br />\nSunday morning, at a quarter of nine, there<br />\ncomes a long procession of fair maidens, one<br />\nto three hundred in number, winding their<br />\nway along the wall of the old time-honored<br />\nImperial Palace. Listen to the echo of their<br />\nlightly-treaded, velvet-matted, hollow-clogs<br />\nmade of pavlonia imperialis. Hearken to the<br />\nchirping and the murmuring of these \"girlscholars\" (for we do not say school girls, but<br />\n\"she-scholars\" or \"girl-scholars\"). They are<br />\ncoming for the morning service at our church!<br />\nThey enter the church, take their seats together by themselves in the eastern wing.<br />\nThen the boys come in pell-mell and take<br />\ntheir seats anywhere they can find, without<br />\nany rule and without any order, but most<br />\nscrupulously avoiding the girls' pews. And<br />\neo things go on.<br />\nThe third of November brings around annually the great national holiday for celebration of the Emperor's Birthday. This also<br /><br />\nbrings the \"Arbor Day\" for the public school<br />\nchildren. The boys of my alma mater keep<br />\non this day a great boat race on the Lake<br />\nBiwa, the largest lake of the country. The<br />\nstudents of all the colleges in the neighborhood are invited and requested to send champions for the intercollegiate race as the climax<br />\nof the day. And here, also, you notice a<br />\ngroup of fair maidens of the Doshisha Girls'<br />\nDepartment and the Nurses' School, seated<br />\non the best point of the promontory, headed<br />\nby the widow of late President Neesiiima, and<br />\nsmiting over their brethrens' enthusiastic combatting with other rival colleges. But these<br />\nmaidens are mute; to talk is for them to blush;<br />\nonly they may from time to time send prizes<br />\nto the winners.<br />\nBeside boat rowing, baseball is also just as<br />\nmuch popular among college students. But<br />\nall these are purely voluntary games in contradistinction from the compulsory military<br />\ndrill of four hours a week. After being graduated from these colleges, they must still fulfill one year's military service, after which<br />\nthey get the rank of second lieutenant of the<br />\nlandwehr. Then they are left free either to<br />\ncontinue in military service or to pursue ordinary civil life. Thus the combination of<br />\nwarlike occupation and literary study, which<br />\nwas existing in Old Japan in a so grotesque<br />\nscale, is now being revived, compelled by the<br />\ninternational relations of New Japan, under a<br />\nbetter form. The habit of college students of<br />\nJapan is very rough and coarse, and they ut \u2022<br />\nterly lack the refined gentlemanliness of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins students. The emphasis laid<br />\non the military drill tends to make them combative, and it is not infrequent that a whole<br />\nclass combines in a \"strike,\" as they call it,<br />\nand refuse to attend a certain unpopular professor's recitation, thus compelling the trustees to dismiss that particular professor.<br />\nThe greatest defect in Japanese college<br />\nstudents' life is, however, the total absence of<br />\nthe healthy, refining and uplifting influence of<br />\nnoble Christian manhood and womanhood.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nBOOK NOTES.<br />\nTHE DAY'S WORK.<br />\nRUDYARD KIPLING.<br /><br />\nWe have toiled with Mr. Kipling so far up<br />\nthe hill, that we refuse indignantly to allow<br />\nhim to set his face in any wise but toward the<br />\ntop.
