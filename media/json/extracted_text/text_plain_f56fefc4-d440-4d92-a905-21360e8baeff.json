The salaries of the members of the faculties have been reduced seriously and all appropriations for the support of laboratories and of scientific expeditions have<br />\nbeen reduced beyond what one<br />\nwould call the danger point. A<br />\nuniversity cannot continue and<br />\nshould not be allowed to continue<br />\nunder such circumstances.\"<br />\nAs for those who have just completed their years of training, Dr.<br />\nAmes said \"that unless some action<br />\nis taken immediately not only will<br />\nthey who are the hope for the future disappear from the intellectual<br />\nworld but also other young men and<br />\nwomen who are planning to devote<br />\nthemselves to an intellectual life<br />\nwill not begin their studies or continue them.

W. Willoughby as \"a gentleman and a<br />\nscholar, and one who has aptly<br />\nbeen called the dean of American<br />\npolitical scientists.\"<br />\nIn presenting to the University<br />\na portrait of his retired colleague<br />\non behalf of \"his/ students, hit<br />\ncolleagues, and his friends\", Dr.<br />\nHart gave a brief characterization of Dr. Willoughby and an<br />\naccount of his work.<br />\n\"As a teacher', Dr. Hart said,<br />\n\"Professor Willoughby has been<br />\ndistinguished by his eminent fairness, by his successful pursuit of<br />\nthe policy of encouraging students, in his own expressive<br />\nphrase, to work out their own<br />\nacademic salvation, by his emphasis upon the grasp of basic<br />\nideas rather than the conning of<br />\nisolated facts, and by his inspiring example of achievement.\"<br /><br />\nAppeals For Money<br /><br />\n\"My address is in reality an appeal for money, an appeal for new<br />\nendowments and for emergency<br />\ngifts at the present moment,\" Dr.<br />\nAmes stated. He continued, \"A<br />\nuniversity such as the Hopkins is<br />\nnot alone essential for the maintenance of civilization but is in reality<br />\nthe essential element in the processes which are evidence of civilization.\"<br />\n\"In order for a university to accomplish its purpose and to fulfill<br />\nthese responsibilities it must have<br />\nthe proper facilities and it must have<br />\nthe necessary faculties to enable<br />\nthem to pursue their studies and to<br />\ntrain their students.<br />\nFinancial Stress Cited<br /><br />\n\"All universities today feel the<br />\nstress of the financial situation and<br />\nare struggling to maintain their existence or at least to maintain their<br />\nefficiency. The salaries of the members of the faculties have been reduced seriously and all appropriations for the support of laboratories and of scientific expeditions have<br />\nbeen reduced beyond what one<br />\nwould call the danger point. A<br />\nuniversity cannot continue and<br />\nshould not be allowed to continue<br />\nunder such circumstances.\"<br />\nAs for those who have just completed their years of training, Dr.<br />\nAmes said \"that unless some action<br />\nis taken immediately not only will<br />\nthey who are the hope for the future disappear from the intellectual<br />\nworld but also other young men and<br />\nwomen who are planning to devote<br />\nthemselves to an intellectual life<br />\nwill not begin their studies or continue them. Unless these young<br />\npeople are provided for in some way<br />\nthere will be a break in civilization.<br />\n\"There is but one solution to<br />\nmeet the difficulty of the present<br />\nemergency and that is to give to a<br />\ngroup of universities, in which I<br />\nshould include the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, large sums of money<br />\nso that they can provide proper oc(Continued on Page 4, Col. 4)<br /><br />\nHOME WOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., FEBRUARY 23, 1934<br /><br />\ntbe flews4detter<br />\nFOUNDED 1397 .<br /><br />\n$2.00<br />\nSubscription per year_<br />\n.$2.50<br />\nBy Mail<br />\nRemit subscription fees to John Myers,<br />\ntreasurer, Student Activities Council, Gilman<br />\nHall, Postoffice, Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nEntered as second-class matter December 3,<br />\n1909, at the Postoffice in Baltimore, Md., under<br />\nthe Act of Congress, November 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished semi-weekly from October to June,<br />\nexcept during examination and college holiday<br />\nperiods by undergraduates of the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nMember of The Intercollegiate Newspaper<br />\nAssociation of the Middle Atlantic States and<br />\nof The National College Press Association.<br />\nUNiversity 7383<br />\nOffice Phone<br />\nEditor's home phone_______LIberty 1714<br />\nBusiness communications should be addressed<br />\nto the Business Manager, Johns Hopkins University.
