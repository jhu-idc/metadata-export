The dominant note in these congratulations<br />\nwas that the Johns Hopkins had not only discovered the true law of creation<br />\nand progress in University work, but had also successfully applied it.<br />\nWhen, in 1876, the doors of a few remantled dwelling-houses were modestly<br />\nopened to the students, less than 100 in number, who came to study science and<br />\nliterature under a few great teachers, some skeptic called the new institution<br />\n\"The Baltimore Experiment.\" This doubter and his phrase have long since<br />\nlost even apparent justification. With the gift of a university site second to<br />\nnone in America, with a re-endowment of one million dollars dependent only<br />\nupon the final subscription of some thousands, now being actively sought, with<br />\na larger student body and teaching staff than ever in her history, with an ex<br />\nceptionally strong and capable administration, and with a quarter century of<br />\nalmost constant growth for record, it may he confidently asserted that an era of<br />\nstill greater expansion and opportunity has opened. And the best days are yet<br />\nto come. Said President Remsen in his inaugural address: \"I believe that a<br />\nnew day has at last dawned, and that the onward march will soon be taken<br />\nup.\" Great institutions, like great cities, are not built in a day. They grow.<br />\nGrowth is their vital essence; cessation of progress is death.<br />\nThe City of Baltimore, the State of Maryland, and the entire South are in<br />\nthe beginnings of a period of great material development, and for permanent<br />\nand best results the intellectual development of their citizens must keep pace<br />\nwith it. In this era, the Johns Hopkins will be such a factor as was the University of Berlin in the reconstruction of Prussia. But national and international as the fame of the University has become, it still m Itains a peculiarly<br />\nclose relation to this locality and its future.<br />\nThough all sections have shared alike the benefits of her pioneer work for<br />\nhigher aims and attainments in American education and scholarship, it is<br />\ndoubtful if anywhere the impulse given to intellectual and material development has been more deservedly appreciated or more zealously cultivated<br />\nthan in the South.<br />\n44<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe natural advantage of proximity, and the rapid economic growth of an<br />\nera of peace, which restored her ability to seek again, as formerly, the higher<br />\ninstruction of her youth within her own bounds, led to a quick appreciation in<br />\nthis region of the unusual opportunities offered, for the first time in America,<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins, and to a constantly increasing stream of young men to<br />\nher doors.<br />\nThe State of Maryland, in twenty-five years. has sent to her 2,000 students,<br />\nand together with the rest of the South nearly 60 per cent. of the total enrollment. Thus has been fulfilled Dr. Gilman's promise, in his inaugural address<br />\nin 1876: that the university's influence should be \"first local, then regional, and<br />\nthen national,\" that it should be in truth as the heraldic legion on its shield<br />\nnow proclaims, \"An institution devoted to learning, both literary and scientific,<br />\nin the State founded by Lord Baltimore.\"<br />\nThese were not meaningless phrases. Independent of its environment as<br />\nthe university was with its magnificent endowment, he chose from the South,<br />\nfirst the men who were to represent this dual idea of the university system, Gildersleeve and Sylvester, former professors in the University of Virginia, fitly<br />\nsymbolizing the realization in Maryland of the Jeffersonian ideal of higher in<br />\nstruction conceived for Virginia. From that day fitness, not sectional, religious,<br />\nor political affiliation has remained the criterion of selection. Without sectional discrimination, Newcomb, Elliott, Browne and other Southern men were<br />\ncalled to her faculty, and the present staff of instruction contains no less than<br />\nforty men of Southern origin or connections, about the same number of Northern, and a similar representation from the West and foreign countries. This<br />\nresult, though without design, shows the broad liberality that governs the<br />\nadministration, and the creative work the university is doing for the South as<br />\nwell as for the rest of the country.<br />\nIt was here that the literary genius of Sidney Lanier first found appropriate<br />\nrecognition in appointment to a lectureship and in the much-needed encouragement from Mr. Gilman. We might mention, too, Woodrow Wilson of Princeton, and William P. Trent of Barnard, as typical of her contribution from the<br />\nSouth to the North.<br />\nThe university will not be the first to disregard the bonds of local attachment that are strengthening year by year. As a Maryland foundation; a \"Baltimore experiment;\" with locally invested funds fianciered by Marylanders;<br />\nendowed with buildings, lectureships, fellowships and scholarships by local<br />\nfriends; reclaimed from financial embarrassment, twice by private and twice by<br />\npublic aid in Maryland, re-created by the gift of a new site which Baltimore<br />\nwill not allow to remain vacant for lack of endowment, she has striven, and<br />\nwill strive, never merely to balance the account but to return a hundred-fold<br />\nthe benefits received. That her return to the state and the city, and to the<br />\nSouth alone has made her one of the best paying investments ever secured, no<br />\none familiar with the facts for a moment doubts.<br />\nA few of these contributions will be found suggestive: 1. More than any<br />\nother influence, the Johns Hopkins University has checked the exodus of youth<br />\nto foreign universities\u2014a custom dating from colonial times at the South\u2014by<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\noffering them not only equal facilities, but a training more American and more<br />\nsuited to our Southern needs. In the past year 360 out of a total of 694 students have been enrolled from the South. 2. The poor but deserving young<br />\nmen of this region have been aided financially and with honors more largely<br />\neven than those of other regions. The benefits of 65 annual scholarships out<br />\nof a total of 90 are limited to the South, and her sons compete on equal terms<br />\nfor the other twenty-five and for twenty fellowships. Over 350 Southern men<br />\nhave received such or greater honors here. 3. Southern Colleges and schools<br />\nhave been filled with men trained in the best methods of modern research and<br />\ninstruction, who are an inspiration to their students and instrumental in organizing associations for the advancement of the educational and material interests<br />\nof their respective States. Nearly 200 former students of Johns Hopkins are at<br />\npresent teaching in the South, distributed in every state and among more than<br />\n65 institutions. Two hundred more are engaged in business or professional<br />\nwork in the South. 4. The development of local industries of the highest importance, such as oyster culture in Maryland and Virginia, has been greatly<br />\nstimulated. A marine laboratory is maintained for the study of the life of the<br />\nChesapeake and of Southern waters. A physical analysis of soils has been of<br />\ngreat agricultural value. The geological department has accomplished much<br />\nfor the farmer, promoter, investor and land-owner in determining soil characteristics, water power facilities, transportation conditions, the location of mineral resources and in publishing and distributing its excellent topographical<br />\nmap and reports for Maryland. 5. The Medical School, aside from the inestimable benefits of its great hospital and trained men and women,has undertaken<br />\nresearches with good results upon the fatal diseases prevalent in this and Southern regions, such as fevers. 6. The first serious attempt on a large scale to<br />\ninsure the preservation of the history and literature of the South as written by<br />\nher own people, has been made through the historical department, which has<br />\npublished more than 20 monographs of original research upon Maryland alone,<br />\nand 61 upon Southern history, economics, and politics. It has the best collections and library facilities in this field of any American university, and it supplements these by courses of systematic instruction in Southern history and<br />\neconomics. 7. The bonds between Baltimore and the South, weakened by the<br />\nrise of new commercial towns and ports, have been greatly strengthened through<br />\nthe University's influence; and her twelve periodical publications bear the name<br />\nof Baltimore and Maryland to the whole civilized and educated world. 8.<br />\nImportant principles of the Johns Hopkins system have been copied in many<br />\nof the Southern Universities; the requirements for the doctorate, the expansion<br />\nof advanced or graduate study, the system of advisers, which insures a personal<br />\ndirection for the undergraduate and finally, a reliance upon the vital and essential, youth, vigor, enthusiasm, reality and the present, rather than upon dim<br />\ntradition and authority.<br />\nJAMPS CURTIS BALLAGH.<br />\n(Revised and rewritten by the author from hts article in The Evamidist, March 29, noa\u2014ED.)<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nFublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the, Students of THE JOHNS.<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nJUNE 4, 1902.<br />\nSubscription $i 50 per year.<br />\nEditor in Chief<br />\n.<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editor,<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n10 Cents a single copy.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nAssistant News Editors,<br />\nAthletic Editors,<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br />\nkssistant Business Manager,<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nROBERT S.

With the accession of President Remsen, a new hand has been at the helm; but it has guided with<br />\nwisdom, moderation and foresight. The high position that the University has<br />\nmaintained in the world of education and research was attested at the celebration of her twenty-fifth birthday, when an unparalleled gathering of scholars<br />\nbrought congratulations and praise from West and East. The many services to<br />\nMaryland and the South rendered by the Hopkins are remarked on in the leading article of this issue. The unconditional gift of the Homewood estate has<br />\ncaused the dream of a splendid home for the University to become a possibility<br />\nof the near future.<br />\nThe financial cloud that for years has hung over us has not yet received its<br />\nsilver lining. The Committee of Seventy, which shouldered the task of raising<br />\nthe last quarter million of the endowment fund, report about $117,000 still unsubscribed. But there are sanguine hopes of an announcement on the Commencement Day, June 10.<br />\nComing to undergraduate life, there is to be seen the results of the same old<br />\n\"Hopkins spirit\" which enables our scanty undergraduate body, with the aid of<br />\na few grads. and medical students, to accomplish wonders.<br />\nAthletics, as reviewed on another page, have met with success. At the<br />\npresent time of writing, a lacrosse game is scheduled for June 11 with the Uni-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHEINEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nversity of Toronto team, intercollegiate champions of Canada and Great Britain. We may fairly consider ourselves champions of the United States; so<br />\nthat the game will be the fiercest, with the gi andest prize for the winner, that<br />\nBaltimore will ever have seen or Hopkins ever played. Let us hope that,in thus<br />\nstepping from a local to a world arena, our mighty men will not get weak in the<br />\nknees from stage-fright.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs have had a prosperous season, and are keeping out of<br />\nfinancial troubles. The Public Debate was more successful than ever before,<br />\nand this year in addition served as a trial for Hopkins, first intercollegiate de<br />\nbate, in which our spell-binders did themselves much credit in their maiden<br />\neffort, although they lost to North Carolina. The student publications have<br />\nbeen carried on with the customary enthusiasm; the senior annual, just published, is in every way worthy of the graduating class. The long-looked-for<br />\nStudent Club has been evolved by the Junior Class. Interclass athletics have<br />\nbeen stimulated by two Junior-Freshman relay races and a tug-of-war, in addition to the usual foot ball game and cane rush. Indeed, there are no lines<br />\nalong which earnest work has not been done, and encouraging results obtained.<br />\n<br />\nTORONTO VERSUS HOPKINS!<br />\nA THROW FOR THE INTERCOLLEGIATE LACROSSE CHAMPIONSHIP OF<br />\nTHE WORLD.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE greatest lacrosse game ever played by Hopkins will take place on June<br />\n11, when the crack Canadian twelve will line up against the Black and<br />\nBlue at American League Park.<br />\n.<br />\nThe intercollegiate champions of Canada have recently returned from a<br />\ntour through England, where they won every contest. That the team from the<br />\nNorth is an all-star aggregation cannot for a moment be doubted, but Hopkins<br />\nhas put up a wonderful game throughout the present season, and, although the<br />\nchances of defeating such an opponent may seem very small, still, all things<br />\nare possible. Every man on our team may be expected to do his duty, and it<br />\nis \"up to\" every student, supporter, and friend of the 'Varsity to give the<br />\ngreatest possible encouragement.<br />\nUndoubtedly, we have the strongest team Hopkins has ever had, and, from<br />\nthe outlook at the present, the strongest which will represent the University for<br />\nsome time to come. Recognizing that we have reached the zenith of our power,<br />\nthe management has very wisely embraced the opportunity to try for the world's<br />\nchampionship. Such a game as the contest promises to be is not likely to be<br />\nseen again in Baltimore for many years.<br />\nThe fact that the contest is an international one, decisive of the world's<br />\nchampionship, makes it likely that President Theodore Roosevelt will accept<br />\nan invitation to attend. The crowd should be a record breaker.<br />\nThe men have been on a training diet for several days, and outdoor practice begins to-day. Every effort will be made to get each player in perfect<br />\nshape, and the prospects are that on June lithe 'Varsity will trot on the field<br />\nin the pink of condition. Let every man help the management by talking up<br />\nthe game in every direction, and by coming himself.<br />\nScrubs, don't forget the 'Varsity needs you.

With our small number of students and the poor facilities for proper training by which we are handicapped, the intercollegiate football championship of Maryland, the championship in track and field work<br />\nagainst all Maryland, and the intercollegiate lacrosse championship of the<br />\nUnited States can by no means be considered a small accomplishment for one<br />\n.scholastic year.

Nothing daunted, however, \"Horace\" went to work<br />\nin an endeavor to squeeze every bit of material that could be found in the<br />\nUniversity, and \"Mack\" led the crusade in search of recruits at the Medical<br />\nSchool. The scores at the beginning of the season were discouraging, but<br />\ngradually better material began to appear, and, in the first of our championship<br />\ngames,\u2014that with Western Maryland College,\u2014we won in good style by a<br />\nscore of 12 to 0. Nevertheless, the championship game with St. John's was<br />\ncontemplated with fear and trembling. The Annapolitan crowd did not hesitate to say that they were represented by the strongest team which they had<br />\ndeveloped for years, and Dr Cain,'supervisor of athletics at St. John's, wrote<br />\nto \"Father Bill\" and confidently informed him that a good walloping for Hopkins was inevitable. And from St. John's showing against teams like Swarthmore and Gallaudet, things did look somewhat blue. Our men were not discouraged by the prospect. The appearance of such men as Garwood, Faris,<br />\nYoutz, Weil, Houghton and Whipple from the Medical School greatly improved<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nC.'02 RELAY TEAM.<br />\n<br />\nmatters and the showing made against Haverford encouraged us to hope that<br />\neven St. John's might be beaten.<br />\nThe day of the game dawned with black clouds frowning down on the<br />\nAmerican League Park from every side, and the continuous downpour throughout the afternoon converted the gridiron into one hugs mud-puddle. In the<br />\nfirst half a battle royal was waged and neither side scored; but in the second,<br />\nHopkins' rooters shouted for joy when they saw our men slowly but surely<br />\nworking the ball towards St. John's goal. The oval was carried to the oneyard line, and, on the third down, St. John's center seeing that the game was<br />\nlost unless some sort of strategy were resorted to, interfered with our center<br />\nman. The referee promptly gave us first down, and to the visitors' great discredit, they showed the \"yellow back\" by refusing to play. The only spoitsmanlike action open to them was to finish the game under protest. The game<br />\nwas promptly forfeited to Hopkins, and with it came the intercollegiate chain<br />\npionship of Maryland.<br />\nDuring the winter, very little was heard from either the track or the lacrosse<br />\nteams, but both squads were quietly doing good work in the cage and on April<br />\n5 the seasons opened in a manner very satisfactory to our adherents. The<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nlacrosse team defeated the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia by<br />\na<br />\nscore of 6 to 1, and the first track and field games ever held in the \"cage\"<br />\ngave<br />\nus a majority of points.<br />\nFrom that time until May 19, lacrosse held sway, and well it might.<br />\nAlthough Tyler, Bruton, J. Bandel and Hatch were lost, good men turned up<br />\nto take their places, and when Hobart was beaten in the second game by<br />\na<br />\nscore of 12 to 1, the rooters joyously shouted, \"Our boys are out for the championship!\" And they were. Harvard went down on the Saturday following by a score of 11 to 1, and when Swarthmore was played to a standstill, 8-2,<br />\nin the closing game, the \"has beens\" declared the team of 1902 the strongest<br />\never turned out by Hopkins.<br />\nCaptain England capped the climax by clipping 2 1.5 seconds off the State<br />\nrecord, at the News Cup games.<br />\nWith so much to be done in the foregoing branches of sport, it hardly<br />\nseemed possible that sufficient material could be spared for base ball. Notwithstanding, Captain Campbell and his men made a very creditable showing under<br />\nso many discouraging circumstances.

The dominant note in these congratulations<br />\nwas that the Johns Hopkins had not only discovered the true law of creation<br />\nand progress in University work, but had also successfully applied it.<br />\nWhen, in 1876, the doors of a few remantled dwelling-houses were modestly<br />\nopened to the students, less than 100 in number, who came to study science and<br />\nliterature under a few great teachers, some skeptic called the new institution<br />\n\"The Baltimore Experiment.\" This doubter and his phrase have long since<br />\nlost even apparent justification. With the gift of a university site second to<br />\nnone in America, with a re-endowment of one million dollars dependent only<br />\nupon the final subscription of some thousands, now being actively sought, with<br />\na larger student body and teaching staff than ever in her history, with an ex<br />\nceptionally strong and capable administration, and with a quarter century of<br />\nalmost constant growth for record, it may he confidently asserted that an era of<br />\nstill greater expansion and opportunity has opened. And the best days are yet<br />\nto come. Said President Remsen in his inaugural address: \"I believe that a<br />\nnew day has at last dawned, and that the onward march will soon be taken<br />\nup.\" Great institutions, like great cities, are not built in a day. They grow.<br />\nGrowth is their vital essence; cessation of progress is death.<br />\nThe City of Baltimore, the State of Maryland, and the entire South are in<br />\nthe beginnings of a period of great material development, and for permanent<br />\nand best results the intellectual development of their citizens must keep pace<br />\nwith it. In this era, the Johns Hopkins will be such a factor as was the University of Berlin in the reconstruction of Prussia. But national and international as the fame of the University has become, it still m Itains a peculiarly<br />\nclose relation to this locality and its future.<br />\nThough all sections have shared alike the benefits of her pioneer work for<br />\nhigher aims and attainments in American education and scholarship, it is<br />\ndoubtful if anywhere the impulse given to intellectual and material development has been more deservedly appreciated or more zealously cultivated<br />\nthan in the South.<br />\n44<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe natural advantage of proximity, and the rapid economic growth of an<br />\nera of peace, which restored her ability to seek again, as formerly, the higher<br />\ninstruction of her youth within her own bounds, led to a quick appreciation in<br />\nthis region of the unusual opportunities offered, for the first time in America,<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins, and to a constantly increasing stream of young men to<br />\nher doors.<br />\nThe State of Maryland, in twenty-five years. has sent to her 2,000 students,<br />\nand together with the rest of the South nearly 60 per cent. of the total enrollment. Thus has been fulfilled Dr. Gilman's promise, in his inaugural address<br />\nin 1876: that the university's influence should be \"first local, then regional, and<br />\nthen national,\" that it should be in truth as the heraldic legion on its shield<br />\nnow proclaims, \"An institution devoted to learning, both literary and scientific,<br />\nin the State founded by Lord Baltimore.\"<br />\nThese were not meaningless phrases. Independent of its environment as<br />\nthe university was with its magnificent endowment, he chose from the South,<br />\nfirst the men who were to represent this dual idea of the university system, Gildersleeve and Sylvester, former professors in the University of Virginia, fitly<br />\nsymbolizing the realization in Maryland of the Jeffersonian ideal of higher in<br />\nstruction conceived for Virginia. From that day fitness, not sectional, religious,<br />\nor political affiliation has remained the criterion of selection. Without sectional discrimination, Newcomb, Elliott, Browne and other Southern men were<br />\ncalled to her faculty, and the present staff of instruction contains no less than<br />\nforty men of Southern origin or connections, about the same number of Northern, and a similar representation from the West and foreign countries. This<br />\nresult, though without design, shows the broad liberality that governs the<br />\nadministration, and the creative work the university is doing for the South as<br />\nwell as for the rest of the country.<br />\nIt was here that the literary genius of Sidney Lanier first found appropriate<br />\nrecognition in appointment to a lectureship and in the much-needed encouragement from Mr. Gilman. We might mention, too, Woodrow Wilson of Princeton, and William P. Trent of Barnard, as typical of her contribution from the<br />\nSouth to the North.<br />\nThe university will not be the first to disregard the bonds of local attachment that are strengthening year by year. As a Maryland foundation; a \"Baltimore experiment;\" with locally invested funds fianciered by Marylanders;<br />\nendowed with buildings, lectureships, fellowships and scholarships by local<br />\nfriends; reclaimed from financial embarrassment, twice by private and twice by<br />\npublic aid in Maryland, re-created by the gift of a new site which Baltimore<br />\nwill not allow to remain vacant for lack of endowment, she has striven, and<br />\nwill strive, never merely to balance the account but to return a hundred-fold<br />\nthe benefits received. That her return to the state and the city, and to the<br />\nSouth alone has made her one of the best paying investments ever secured, no<br />\none familiar with the facts for a moment doubts.<br />\nA few of these contributions will be found suggestive: 1. More than any<br />\nother influence, the Johns Hopkins University has checked the exodus of youth<br />\nto foreign universities\u2014a custom dating from colonial times at the South\u2014by<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\noffering them not only equal facilities, but a training more American and more<br />\nsuited to our Southern needs. In the past year 360 out of a total of 694 students have been enrolled from the South. 2. The poor but deserving young<br />\nmen of this region have been aided financially and with honors more largely<br />\neven than those of other regions. The benefits of 65 annual scholarships out<br />\nof a total of 90 are limited to the South, and her sons compete on equal terms<br />\nfor the other twenty-five and for twenty fellowships. Over 350 Southern men<br />\nhave received such or greater honors here. 3. Southern Colleges and schools<br />\nhave been filled with men trained in the best methods of modern research and<br />\ninstruction, who are an inspiration to their students and instrumental in organizing associations for the advancement of the educational and material interests<br />\nof their respective States. Nearly 200 former students of Johns Hopkins are at<br />\npresent teaching in the South, distributed in every state and among more than<br />\n65 institutions. Two hundred more are engaged in business or professional<br />\nwork in the South. 4. The development of local industries of the highest importance, such as oyster culture in Maryland and Virginia, has been greatly<br />\nstimulated. A marine laboratory is maintained for the study of the life of the<br />\nChesapeake and of Southern waters. A physical analysis of soils has been of<br />\ngreat agricultural value. The geological department has accomplished much<br />\nfor the farmer, promoter, investor and land-owner in determining soil characteristics, water power facilities, transportation conditions, the location of mineral resources and in publishing and distributing its excellent topographical<br />\nmap and reports for Maryland. 5. The Medical School, aside from the inestimable benefits of its great hospital and trained men and women,has undertaken<br />\nresearches with good results upon the fatal diseases prevalent in this and Southern regions, such as fevers. 6. The first serious attempt on a large scale to<br />\ninsure the preservation of the history and literature of the South as written by<br />\nher own people, has been made through the historical department, which has<br />\npublished more than 20 monographs of original research upon Maryland alone,<br />\nand 61 upon Southern history, economics, and politics. It has the best collections and library facilities in this field of any American university, and it supplements these by courses of systematic instruction in Southern history and<br />\neconomics. 7. The bonds between Baltimore and the South, weakened by the<br />\nrise of new commercial towns and ports, have been greatly strengthened through<br />\nthe University's influence; and her twelve periodical publications bear the name<br />\nof Baltimore and Maryland to the whole civilized and educated world. 8.<br />\nImportant principles of the Johns Hopkins system have been copied in many<br />\nof the Southern Universities; the requirements for the doctorate, the expansion<br />\nof advanced or graduate study, the system of advisers, which insures a personal<br />\ndirection for the undergraduate and finally, a reliance upon the vital and essential, youth, vigor, enthusiasm, reality and the present, rather than upon dim<br />\ntradition and authority.<br />\nJAMPS CURTIS BALLAGH.<br />\n(Revised and rewritten by the author from hts article in The Evamidist, March 29, noa\u2014ED.)<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nFublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the, Students of THE JOHNS.<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nJUNE 4, 1902.<br />\nSubscription $i 50 per year.<br />\nEditor in Chief<br />\n.<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editor,<br />\n.<br /><br />\n10 Cents a single copy.<br />\n.<br /><br />\nAssistant News Editors,<br />\nAthletic Editors,<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br />\nkssistant Business Manager,<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nROBERT S.

With the accession of President Remsen, a new hand has been at the helm; but it has guided with<br />\nwisdom, moderation and foresight. The high position that the University has<br />\nmaintained in the world of education and research was attested at the celebration of her twenty-fifth birthday, when an unparalleled gathering of scholars<br />\nbrought congratulations and praise from West and East. The many services to<br />\nMaryland and the South rendered by the Hopkins are remarked on in the leading article of this issue. The unconditional gift of the Homewood estate has<br />\ncaused the dream of a splendid home for the University to become a possibility<br />\nof the near future.<br />\nThe financial cloud that for years has hung over us has not yet received its<br />\nsilver lining. The Committee of Seventy, which shouldered the task of raising<br />\nthe last quarter million of the endowment fund, report about $117,000 still unsubscribed. But there are sanguine hopes of an announcement on the Commencement Day, June 10.<br />\nComing to undergraduate life, there is to be seen the results of the same old<br />\n\"Hopkins spirit\" which enables our scanty undergraduate body, with the aid of<br />\na few grads. and medical students, to accomplish wonders.<br />\nAthletics, as reviewed on another page, have met with success. At the<br />\npresent time of writing, a lacrosse game is scheduled for June 11 with the Uni-<br /><br />\nTHEINEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nversity of Toronto team, intercollegiate champions of Canada and Great Britain. We may fairly consider ourselves champions of the United States; so<br />\nthat the game will be the fiercest, with the gi andest prize for the winner, that<br />\nBaltimore will ever have seen or Hopkins ever played. Let us hope that,in thus<br />\nstepping from a local to a world arena, our mighty men will not get weak in the<br />\nknees from stage-fright.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs have had a prosperous season, and are keeping out of<br />\nfinancial troubles. The Public Debate was more successful than ever before,<br />\nand this year in addition served as a trial for Hopkins, first intercollegiate de<br />\nbate, in which our spell-binders did themselves much credit in their maiden<br />\neffort, although they lost to North Carolina. The student publications have<br />\nbeen carried on with the customary enthusiasm; the senior annual, just published, is in every way worthy of the graduating class. The long-looked-for<br />\nStudent Club has been evolved by the Junior Class. Interclass athletics have<br />\nbeen stimulated by two Junior-Freshman relay races and a tug-of-war, in addition to the usual foot ball game and cane rush. Indeed, there are no lines<br />\nalong which earnest work has not been done, and encouraging results obtained.<br /><br />\nTORONTO VERSUS HOPKINS!<br />\nA THROW FOR THE INTERCOLLEGIATE LACROSSE CHAMPIONSHIP OF<br />\nTHE WORLD.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE greatest lacrosse game ever played by Hopkins will take place on June<br />\n11, when the crack Canadian twelve will line up against the Black and<br />\nBlue at American League Park.<br />\n.<br />\nThe intercollegiate champions of Canada have recently returned from a<br />\ntour through England, where they won every contest. That the team from the<br />\nNorth is an all-star aggregation cannot for a moment be doubted, but Hopkins<br />\nhas put up a wonderful game throughout the present season, and, although the<br />\nchances of defeating such an opponent may seem very small, still, all things<br />\nare possible. Every man on our team may be expected to do his duty, and it<br />\nis \"up to\" every student, supporter, and friend of the 'Varsity to give the<br />\ngreatest possible encouragement.<br />\nUndoubtedly, we have the strongest team Hopkins has ever had, and, from<br />\nthe outlook at the present, the strongest which will represent the University for<br />\nsome time to come. Recognizing that we have reached the zenith of our power,<br />\nthe management has very wisely embraced the opportunity to try for the world's<br />\nchampionship. Such a game as the contest promises to be is not likely to be<br />\nseen again in Baltimore for many years.<br />\nThe fact that the contest is an international one, decisive of the world's<br />\nchampionship, makes it likely that President Theodore Roosevelt will accept<br />\nan invitation to attend. The crowd should be a record breaker.<br />\nThe men have been on a training diet for several days, and outdoor practice begins to-day. Every effort will be made to get each player in perfect<br />\nshape, and the prospects are that on June lithe 'Varsity will trot on the field<br />\nin the pink of condition. Let every man help the management by talking up<br />\nthe game in every direction, and by coming himself.<br />\nScrubs, don't forget the 'Varsity needs you. If everybody will lend a<br />\nhand, victory is possible.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nTHE CLASS OF '02.<br /><br />\nEDWARD B BEASLEY, track team, glee club, class executive committee<br />\n'00\u2014'01, will enter the Johns Hopkins Medical School.<br />\nHENRY BERUWKES, DAVID MACHT, Phi Beta Kappa, and Wm.

With our small number of students and the poor facilities for proper training by which we are handicapped, the intercollegiate football championship of Maryland, the championship in track and field work<br />\nagainst all Maryland, and the intercollegiate lacrosse championship of the<br />\nUnited States can by no means be considered a small accomplishment for one<br />\n.scholastic year. It is practically all we could have done.<br />\nOur championship relay team did not bring home another banner from the<br />\nannual relay races at the University of Pennsylvania, but had not W. E. Hoffman fallen by accident, we should most certainly have had one more pennant<br />\nfor the trophy room. Notwithstanding this, the boys ran a great race, and<br />\ncame very near winning out anyhow. The track men more than made up for<br />\nthis defeat, however, by the great work done in the championship games held at<br />\nElectric Park on May 14. Hopkins made a total of 60 points while our'nearest<br />\ncompetitor\u2014the Maryland Athletic Club\u2014gained 36 points.<br />\nAt the beginning of the foot ball season those men who understood the<br />\nsituation best were sincerely sorry for Captain Gillespie.

Nothing daunted, however, \"Horace\" went to work<br />\nin an endeavor to squeeze every bit of material that could be found in the<br />\nUniversity, and \"Mack\" led the crusade in search of recruits at the Medical<br />\nSchool. The scores at the beginning of the season were discouraging, but<br />\ngradually better material began to appear, and, in the first of our championship<br />\ngames,\u2014that with Western Maryland College,\u2014we won in good style by a<br />\nscore of 12 to 0. Nevertheless, the championship game with St. John's was<br />\ncontemplated with fear and trembling. The Annapolitan crowd did not hesitate to say that they were represented by the strongest team which they had<br />\ndeveloped for years, and Dr Cain,'supervisor of athletics at St. John's, wrote<br />\nto \"Father Bill\" and confidently informed him that a good walloping for Hopkins was inevitable. And from St. John's showing against teams like Swarthmore and Gallaudet, things did look somewhat blue. Our men were not discouraged by the prospect. The appearance of such men as Garwood, Faris,<br />\nYoutz, Weil, Houghton and Whipple from the Medical School greatly improved<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nC.'02 RELAY TEAM.<br /><br />\nmatters and the showing made against Haverford encouraged us to hope that<br />\neven St. John's might be beaten.<br />\nThe day of the game dawned with black clouds frowning down on the<br />\nAmerican League Park from every side, and the continuous downpour throughout the afternoon converted the gridiron into one hugs mud-puddle. In the<br />\nfirst half a battle royal was waged and neither side scored; but in the second,<br />\nHopkins' rooters shouted for joy when they saw our men slowly but surely<br />\nworking the ball towards St. John's goal. The oval was carried to the oneyard line, and, on the third down, St. John's center seeing that the game was<br />\nlost unless some sort of strategy were resorted to, interfered with our center<br />\nman. The referee promptly gave us first down, and to the visitors' great discredit, they showed the \"yellow back\" by refusing to play. The only spoitsmanlike action open to them was to finish the game under protest. The game<br />\nwas promptly forfeited to Hopkins, and with it came the intercollegiate chain<br />\npionship of Maryland.<br />\nDuring the winter, very little was heard from either the track or the lacrosse<br />\nteams, but both squads were quietly doing good work in the cage and on April<br />\n5 the seasons opened in a manner very satisfactory to our adherents. The<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nlacrosse team defeated the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia by<br />\na<br />\nscore of 6 to 1, and the first track and field games ever held in the \"cage\"<br />\ngave<br />\nus a majority of points.<br />\nFrom that time until May 19, lacrosse held sway, and well it might.<br />\nAlthough Tyler, Bruton, J. Bandel and Hatch were lost, good men turned up<br />\nto take their places, and when Hobart was beaten in the second game by<br />\na<br />\nscore of 12 to 1, the rooters joyously shouted, \"Our boys are out for the championship!\" And they were. Harvard went down on the Saturday following by a score of 11 to 1, and when Swarthmore was played to a standstill, 8-2,<br />\nin the closing game, the \"has beens\" declared the team of 1902 the strongest<br />\never turned out by Hopkins.<br />\nCaptain England capped the climax by clipping 2 1.5 seconds off the State<br />\nrecord, at the News Cup games.<br />\nWith so much to be done in the foregoing branches of sport, it hardly<br />\nseemed possible that sufficient material could be spared for base ball. Notwithstanding, Captain Campbell and his men made a very creditable showing under<br />\nso many discouraging circumstances. We hope they may improve next year.<br />\nFOOT BALL ('VARSITY GAMES.)<br /><br />\nJ. H. vs. Rock Hill College, 24-5.<br />\nMd.
