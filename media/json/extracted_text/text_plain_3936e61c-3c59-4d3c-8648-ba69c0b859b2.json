No. 46<br />\n<br />\nApril 27, 1971, Baltimore, Maryland<br />\n<br />\n75th Year<br />\n<br />\nProblems Noted At BMC<br />\nBy GEOFF BRAINERD<br />\nDonald Bickert, Director of<br />\nand<br />\nBusiness Services<br />\nMarven Kaberle, newly<br />\nappointed Manager of the<br />\nBroadway Management<br />\nCorporation, confront<br />\nespecially difficult circumstances in the administration of the Hopkins<br />\neast Baltimore auxiliary<br />\nservices.<br />\nIn January, 1970, Kaberle<br />\nand Bickert authored a<br />\ndefinitive proposal advocating consolidation of<br />\nadministration under the<br />\nauspices of a single authority.<br />\nThe purpose was reduction of<br />\noperating deficits through<br />\nPursuit of coherent thus efficient management.<br />\nIn the fifteen months since<br />\nthe report, these auxiliary<br />\nservices have increased their<br />\ndeficit to $440,000 for this<br />\nfiscal year, yet the proposed<br />\nreorganization has not occurred. Currently, administration of the auxiliary<br />\nservices is shared by the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical Institutions, the University<br />\nProper, and the BMC.<br />\nThe services are located on<br />\nland leased from the city by<br />\nDevelopment<br />\nBroadway<br />\n<br />\nDonald Bicker'<br />\nCorporation on 28 March 1956<br />\nfor a term of 75 years. Conditions of the lease restrict<br />\nnot only the development of<br />\nthe land, but the use of each<br />\nbuilding. The city must<br />\nconcur with any changes to be<br />\nmade.<br />\nEven if the holdings were<br />\ntransferred to a tax-exempt<br />\nnon-profit organization, the<br />\namount of tax money saved<br />\nwould be due the city as<br />\nadditional rent. Hassles like<br />\nthis have impeded the<br />\nUniversity's long term ob-<br />\n<br />\nject ives.<br />\nnor<br />\nKaberle<br />\nNeither<br />\nBickert could explain the<br />\nfailure to act on their<br />\nproposal. However, Mr.<br />\nKaberle believes that his new<br />\npost will enable him not only<br />\nto work for the proposed realso<br />\nbut<br />\norganization,<br />\nsignificantly tighten the BMC<br />\nbudget.<br />\nnor<br />\nKaberle<br />\nNeither<br />\nassign<br />\nwould<br />\nBickert<br />\nresponsibility for the inaction. The method of acquiring<br />\nthe varied holdings seems<br />\nresponsible. Both University<br />\nand Hospital began purchasing<br />\nbuildings to serve their east<br />\nBaltimore personnel. BMC<br />\nwas founded to correlate<br />\nboth<br />\nof<br />\nmanagement<br />\nholdings. The Preliminary<br />\nPlan for Management of<br />\nJHU/ JHH Aux. Enterprises<br />\nelucidated the inefficiency of<br />\nthis JHU-JHMI-BMC setup in<br />\nOctober 1969. Yet even the<br />\nlucid outline of January 1970<br />\nremains unheeded.<br />\nMr. Kaberle maintains that<br />\nthe debt can definitely be<br />\nreduced. He also states that<br />\nthe Auxiliary services must<br />\nHopkins<br />\nunder<br />\nremain<br />\ncontrol to ensure that the<br />\nacademic and research<br />\ndemands be met as first<br />\npriority. .<br />\n<br />\nWickwire Decision<br />\nSent to Zdanis Panel<br />\nBy IVAN RODRIGUEZ<br />\nThe Academic Council has<br />\ndeclined to take definitive<br />\naction on the question of Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire's social<br />\ninvolvement courses, leaving<br />\nthe final decision to the<br />\nZdanis Committee on NonDepartmental Courses.<br />\nIn a statement released last<br />\nThursday, the Academic<br />\nCouncil asserted that the<br />\nZdanis Committee had been<br />\ndesignated as the \"instrumentality by means of<br />\nwhich all courses given<br />\noutside of the framework of a<br />\ndepartment can be certified<br />\nfor academic credit.\"<br />\nThough the statement<br />\nendorses guidelines<br />\nsuggested in the Zdanis<br />\nReport, it encourages the<br />\ncommittee to \"apply the<br />\nprinciples flexibly\" in view of<br />\nthe \"evolutionary nature of<br />\nthe social practicum program.\"<br />\nThe Principle<br />\nThe statement went on to<br />\nsay that the Council \"approves the principle of social<br />\npracticum courses\" and that<br />\nit \"recognizes the usefulness<br />\nof the present program.\"<br />\nZdanis,<br />\nRichard<br />\nDr.<br />\nChairman of the Faculty<br />\nNonon<br />\nCommittee<br />\nDepartmental Courses, said<br />\nhis group \"will work within<br />\nthe Council guidelines.\"<br />\nAsked what sort of consideration would be given to<br />\nthe Kronsberg-Mahinka plan<br />\nto permit students to take u<br />\nto 12 credits of non.departmental courses during<br />\n<br />\ntheir 4 years, Zdanis replied,<br />\n\"We had discussed a plan of<br />\nthat type earlier and it didn't<br />\nend up in our final recommendations to the Council.\"<br />\n<br />\nforce on campus because the<br />\nstudents would support it. \"If<br />\nstudents are behind the<br />\nAdSenate, then the<br />\nministration would have to<br />\nlisten to us,\" he declared.<br />\nThe<br />\npresent<br />\nStudent<br />\nCouncil elections are very<br />\nimportant to Bates' plans. \"I<br />\nwould like to have all twenty<br />\nStudent Council members in<br />\nfavor of the Senate,\" Bates<br />\nstated.<br />\nBates plans on writing a<br />\nnew constitution over the<br />\nsummer.

This restriction<br />\nwould eliminate three of the<br />\nfour community involvement<br />\ncourses taught by Wickwire.<br />\n<br />\nHistory Department<br />\nGains 2 Professors Bates Elected to Head SC<br />\nBy B.H.

Add to this the operation of the Broadway<br />\nDevelopment and Broadway Management Corporations,<br />\nand you have a picture of Hopkins of which almost no<br />\none at Homewood is aware.<br />\nUndergraduates, faced with ever-increasing tuition<br />\ncosts and what many feel to be less than adequate<br />\neducational services, have a fundamental right to be<br />\ninformed on the finances of all components of this<br />\nUniversity. When one of those components appears to be<br />\nlosing money due to poor management (as our study of<br />\nEast Baltimore's auxiliaries indicates), this right is<br />\neven more apparent.<br />\nIn 1969 Hospital Treasurer Thomas Barnes reported to<br />\nManager of Business Service Donald Bickert that the<br />\nBroadway Management Corporation was a \"financial<br />\nfiasco.\" Bickert compiled other evidence indicating the<br />\nsame situation, and submitted a proposed<br />\nreorganization plan for the system in October 1969. As of<br />\nthis time that plan has not been put into effect.<br />\nWe demand that the University make available, in<br />\nclear and understandable form, the facts and figures<br />\nbehind the East Baltimore financial situation.<br />\nA report issued in October 1969 made what we feel to<br />\nbe concrete, practical recommendations which could go<br />\na long way toward clearing up this situation.<br />\nWe call on President Eisenhower to take steps to<br />\nimpliment these reforms. Particularly, we call for institution of centralized administration, open discussion<br />\nof all finances, and a clearly defined statement of<br />\nUniversity aims and objectives with regards to the<br />\nauxiliary enterprises.<br />\n<br />\nBack to Zdanis<br />\nIn spite of earlier hopeful signs, the Academic Council<br />\nhas reverted to its usual, childish behavior in regard to<br />\nDr. Wickwire's social action courses. In a one-page<br />\ndocument, Hopkins' top governing body shows that it is<br />\nrivaled only by Lincoln Gordon in constructing sentences<br />\nof obscure drivel. First, the group says that courses<br />\nlike Wickwire's are a good idea, making some vague<br />\nfeints at establishing a place for such programs in the<br />\nfuture. But then, following Gordon's diplomatic style,<br />\nthis learned body reverses itself and endorses the<br />\nproposals of the Zdanis committee, which has, in effect,<br />\ncome out against such courses by limiting Wichwire to<br />\nthree credits of teaching per semester. In the one<br />\nsubstantive statement in the entire document, the<br />\nCouncil goes out on a liberal educational limb and<br />\n\"encourages the Committee on Non-Departmental<br />\nCourses (Zdanis Committee) to apply these principles<br />\nflexibly.\" It is little wonder that this University is in<br />\nsuch poor financial shape, when a group of its top<br />\nscholars can meet for hours on end, examine such<br />\neveidence as the Carniegie Commision report, meet for<br />\nseveral more hours on a Saturday, finally reach a<br />\nclimactic decision, and say absolutely nothing. It<br />\nbecomes increasingly clear whey the Council won't<br />\nallow observers in its meetings. Apparently it doesn't<br />\ndo anything.<br />\n<br />\nOFF<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThere is a situation here in<br />\nMcCoy Hall that seems to be<br />\nbeyond the control of any of<br />\nthose involved, so I'm writing<br />\nthis letter as a last-ditch<br />\nappeal.<br />\nMy family and I have the<br />\nmisfortune to live directly<br />\nabove the grad club, and the<br />\nnightly music and other noise<br />\nmake study or sleep impossible. Repeated complaints to the club, the GSO<br />\npresident, and Hopkins<br />\nhousing authorities haven't<br />\n<br />\naltered the situation at all.<br />\nThe disturbance isn't<br />\nconfined to our apartment<br />\nalone; I know of one couple<br />\nwho moved because of it, and<br />\nI have friends on the fourth<br />\nfloor who have also complained. We would move too,<br />\nbut with two small children<br />\nwe need a two-bedroom<br />\napartment and there isn't one<br />\navailable.<br />\nThe Grad Club serves a<br />\nuseful and necessary function, but we feel something<br />\nhas to be done about the<br />\nexcessive noise. It's irritating<br />\nall week long, but on the<br />\nweekends it becomes oppressive. The Grad Club<br />\n<br />\nneeds a place to meet, but we<br />\nneed our sleep.<br />\nMike Rhodes<br />\n<br />\nMoved to despair<br />\n<br />\nGovernance<br />\nFaculty Members<br />\nFor those members of the Hopkins community who believe that governance should<br />\nbe predicated upon published rules,<br />\nreasonably arrived at through regularized,<br />\nrepresentative procedures, conditions at<br />\nHopkins should move them to despair.<br />\nHopkins is a place where many, if not<br />\nmost, important decisions and procedures<br />\nseem to be determined on a nearly ad hoc<br />\nbasis, and frequently in a rather secretive<br />\nmanner. Members of the community lack<br />\nthe information, and perhaps the will, to<br />\nmake authority responsible. Existing institutions frequently are disregarded. And<br />\nprocedures followed in committees that are<br />\nset up to deal with particular problems tend<br />\nto be a travesty of declared liberal concerns<br />\nfor due process and responsiveness.<br />\nMembers of the administration, of the<br />\nfaculty, and of the student body share<br />\nculpability for this state of affairs.<br />\nCases of administration culpability come<br />\nmost readily to mind. Thus, for example, at<br />\nthe level of the central administration, the<br />\nrecent salutary decision to put students on<br />\nthe Board of Trustees was concretely implemented through the personal choice by<br />\nthe new president of students he likes and of<br />\nwhom he approves, while the issue of how<br />\nstudents are to be chosen in the future<br />\nremains undecided. Were the proper mode<br />\nof selectiong students to the Board not so<br />\nobvious, one might excuse the present<br />\nmethod of selection in terms of expediency.<br />\nBut is there really any substantial answer to<br />\nthe proposition that students who are to<br />\nrepresent part or all of the student body on<br />\nthe Board of Trustees should effectively be<br />\nchosen by the vote of their constitutency,<br />\nhowever deficient election procedures at<br />\nHopkins may have been to date.<br />\nAnd again, at the level of the Homewood<br />\nadministration, the recent elections to the<br />\nAdvisory Search Committee should remind<br />\nus that there are no regularized procedures<br />\ngoverning all faculty elections. There are no<br />\nrules requiring adequate notice, no rules<br />\nspecifying nomination procedures, no rules<br />\nspecifying election procedures, and no rules<br />\nrequiring notification of' the results of<br />\nelections. Thus, without any forewarning,<br />\nsome faculty members learned late on the<br />\nafternoon of April 8th that the Homewood<br />\nfaculty would elect its representatives to the<br />\nAdvisory Search Committee. Although the<br />\nUniversity was closed on the 9th, the 10th,<br />\nand thellth, nominations, we were informed,<br />\nhad to be in by the afternoon of the 12th. We<br />\nwere not informed how many votes would be<br />\nrequired for nomination; nor were we informed in advance of the procedures to be<br />\nfollowed for the runoff ballot. When jr<br />\nformed of the procedure for the final ballot<br />\nat the time that we received that ballot, it<br />\nThis Forum is signed--as equals-by Richard A.<br />\nCone, Lester A. Ettlinger, Leon .1. Gleser. Richard M. Pfeffer, and Wilfrid Prest.<br />\n<br />\nappeared that the procedures chosen were<br />\nunprecedented at Hopkins and that they<br />\nwould have a strong conservatizing impact.<br />\nAfter the election, to compound matters, the<br />\nDean's office did not announce the complete<br />\nresults, information of which might have<br />\nconfirmed suspicion of bias in the<br />\npreferential voting procedure.<br />\nMoreover, since, in the one hand, the<br />\nAdvisory Search Committee was not constituted at the outset by the usual,<br />\ndevastatingly narrow charge, it is hardly<br />\nsurprising, on the other, that the scope of its<br />\nadvisory powers remains wholly undefined.<br />\nThe faculty, in short, has just participated-without public objection by any of us--in an<br />\nirregular election for posts vit no presently<br />\nascertainable power.<br />\nOr take the pattern of crass manipulation<br />\nof the symbols of legitimacy by administrators that is epitomized by the<br />\nhistory of the so-called advisory committee<br />\nto select a new dean of undergraduate affairs. According to members of the committee, it was appointed by Dean Strider,<br />\nerratically called into session by Dean<br />\nStrider, regularly not called into session by<br />\nDean Strider, and effectively told whom it<br />\nwould select by Dean Strider.<br />\nOr take the various ad hoc ways in which<br />\nthe Student Council has selected<br />\nrepresentatives of the student body to sit on<br />\nvarious joint committees. Judging by the<br />\nresults of those selections, the consensus of<br />\nconcerned student opinion seems to be that<br />\ntheir representatives rarely have tended to<br />\nargue the undergraduate position very<br />\nvigorously in the face of faculty and administration de facto domination of committee proceedings.<br />\nThe list, as many know better than we,<br />\ncould be extended indefinitely<br />\nJunior faculty, for example, generally do<br />\nnot have real representation on bodies of the<br />\nUniversity. And when they do, the senior<br />\nfaculty participates in voting for junior<br />\nfaculty representatives.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees is quite literally not<br />\nresponsible to the University community. It<br />\nis a self-perpetuating, nearly wholly unsupervised body of men, many of whom<br />\nknow very little about current University<br />\nmatters beyond issues concerning the<br />\nbalance sheet.<br />\nAPL also is not subject to effective control<br />\nby the University community, it being<br />\nessentially under the jurisdiction of one<br />\nmember of the Board of Trustees who, at<br />\nleast based upon his recent, single, public<br />\nappearance on campus, appears to be a<br />\npersonification of the military-industrialuniversity complex.<br />\nThis comprehensive pattern of arbitrariness is perpetuated by those in whose<br />\ninterest it is to do so and by the rest of us who<br />\nhave been too apathetic to do anything about<br />\nit.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nApril 27, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7\u00b0<br />\n<br />\nCensor's Chairman<br />\n<br />\nMrs. Shecter: 'nudity in the boudoir only'<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nMrs. Shecter was wary at<br />\nfirst about granting an interview to the poor man's<br />\nSeymour Hersh, namely,<br />\nmyself. She had a right to be<br />\ncautious; the entire board<br />\nhad<br />\nconsistently<br />\nbeen<br />\nroasted by the press. Her<br />\nviews of censorship were<br />\nshaped, I knew, by her<br />\nconcern for children.

The city must<br />\nconcur with any changes to be<br />\nmade.<br />\nEven if the holdings were<br />\ntransferred to a tax-exempt<br />\nnon-profit organization, the<br />\namount of tax money saved<br />\nwould be due the city as<br />\nadditional rent.

It is safe to say that almost no<br />\nundergraduates were aware of the fact that Hopkins<br />\nowns a shopping center, an apartment complex or the<br />\nbuilding leased by Sheraton Inns in the East Baltimore<br />\ncampus area. Add to this the operation of the Broadway<br />\nDevelopment and Broadway Management Corporations,<br />\nand you have a picture of Hopkins of which almost no<br />\none at Homewood is aware.<br />\nUndergraduates, faced with ever-increasing tuition<br />\ncosts and what many feel to be less than adequate<br />\neducational services, have a fundamental right to be<br />\ninformed on the finances of all components of this<br />\nUniversity. When one of those components appears to be<br />\nlosing money due to poor management (as our study of<br />\nEast Baltimore's auxiliaries indicates), this right is<br />\neven more apparent.<br />\nIn 1969 Hospital Treasurer Thomas Barnes reported to<br />\nManager of Business Service Donald Bickert that the<br />\nBroadway Management Corporation was a \"financial<br />\nfiasco.\" Bickert compiled other evidence indicating the<br />\nsame situation, and submitted a proposed<br />\nreorganization plan for the system in October 1969. As of<br />\nthis time that plan has not been put into effect.<br />\nWe demand that the University make available, in<br />\nclear and understandable form, the facts and figures<br />\nbehind the East Baltimore financial situation.<br />\nA report issued in October 1969 made what we feel to<br />\nbe concrete, practical recommendations which could go<br />\na long way toward clearing up this situation.<br />\nWe call on President Eisenhower to take steps to<br />\nimpliment these reforms. Particularly, we call for institution of centralized administration, open discussion<br />\nof all finances, and a clearly defined statement of<br />\nUniversity aims and objectives with regards to the<br />\nauxiliary enterprises.<br /><br />\nBack to Zdanis<br />\nIn spite of earlier hopeful signs, the Academic Council<br />\nhas reverted to its usual, childish behavior in regard to<br />\nDr. Wickwire's social action courses. In a one-page<br />\ndocument, Hopkins' top governing body shows that it is<br />\nrivaled only by Lincoln Gordon in constructing sentences<br />\nof obscure drivel. First, the group says that courses<br />\nlike Wickwire's are a good idea, making some vague<br />\nfeints at establishing a place for such programs in the<br />\nfuture. But then, following Gordon's diplomatic style,<br />\nthis learned body reverses itself and endorses the<br />\nproposals of the Zdanis committee, which has, in effect,<br />\ncome out against such courses by limiting Wichwire to<br />\nthree credits of teaching per semester. In the one<br />\nsubstantive statement in the entire document, the<br />\nCouncil goes out on a liberal educational limb and<br />\n\"encourages the Committee on Non-Departmental<br />\nCourses (Zdanis Committee) to apply these principles<br />\nflexibly.\" It is little wonder that this University is in<br />\nsuch poor financial shape, when a group of its top<br />\nscholars can meet for hours on end, examine such<br />\neveidence as the Carniegie Commision report, meet for<br />\nseveral more hours on a Saturday, finally reach a<br />\nclimactic decision, and say absolutely nothing. It<br />\nbecomes increasingly clear whey the Council won't<br />\nallow observers in its meetings. Apparently it doesn't<br />\ndo anything.<br /><br />\nOFF<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThere is a situation here in<br />\nMcCoy Hall that seems to be<br />\nbeyond the control of any of<br />\nthose involved, so I'm writing<br />\nthis letter as a last-ditch<br />\nappeal.<br />\nMy family and I have the<br />\nmisfortune to live directly<br />\nabove the grad club, and the<br />\nnightly music and other noise<br />\nmake study or sleep impossible. Repeated complaints to the club, the GSO<br />\npresident, and Hopkins<br />\nhousing authorities haven't<br /><br />\naltered the situation at all.<br />\nThe disturbance isn't<br />\nconfined to our apartment<br />\nalone; I know of one couple<br />\nwho moved because of it, and<br />\nI have friends on the fourth<br />\nfloor who have also complained.

Members of the community lack<br />\nthe information, and perhaps the will, to<br />\nmake authority responsible. Existing institutions frequently are disregarded. And<br />\nprocedures followed in committees that are<br />\nset up to deal with particular problems tend<br />\nto be a travesty of declared liberal concerns<br />\nfor due process and responsiveness.<br />\nMembers of the administration, of the<br />\nfaculty, and of the student body share<br />\nculpability for this state of affairs.<br />\nCases of administration culpability come<br />\nmost readily to mind. Thus, for example, at<br />\nthe level of the central administration, the<br />\nrecent salutary decision to put students on<br />\nthe Board of Trustees was concretely implemented through the personal choice by<br />\nthe new president of students he likes and of<br />\nwhom he approves, while the issue of how<br />\nstudents are to be chosen in the future<br />\nremains undecided. Were the proper mode<br />\nof selectiong students to the Board not so<br />\nobvious, one might excuse the present<br />\nmethod of selection in terms of expediency.<br />\nBut is there really any substantial answer to<br />\nthe proposition that students who are to<br />\nrepresent part or all of the student body on<br />\nthe Board of Trustees should effectively be<br />\nchosen by the vote of their constitutency,<br />\nhowever deficient election procedures at<br />\nHopkins may have been to date.<br />\nAnd again, at the level of the Homewood<br />\nadministration, the recent elections to the<br />\nAdvisory Search Committee should remind<br />\nus that there are no regularized procedures<br />\ngoverning all faculty elections. There are no<br />\nrules requiring adequate notice, no rules<br />\nspecifying nomination procedures, no rules<br />\nspecifying election procedures, and no rules<br />\nrequiring notification of' the results of<br />\nelections. Thus, without any forewarning,<br />\nsome faculty members learned late on the<br />\nafternoon of April 8th that the Homewood<br />\nfaculty would elect its representatives to the<br />\nAdvisory Search Committee. Although the<br />\nUniversity was closed on the 9th, the 10th,<br />\nand thellth, nominations, we were informed,<br />\nhad to be in by the afternoon of the 12th. We<br />\nwere not informed how many votes would be<br />\nrequired for nomination; nor were we informed in advance of the procedures to be<br />\nfollowed for the runoff ballot. When jr<br />\nformed of the procedure for the final ballot<br />\nat the time that we received that ballot, it<br />\nThis Forum is signed--as equals-by Richard A.<br />\nCone, Lester A.
