This was, however, disproved<br />\nby a certain spirited few, still remaining on the Hopkins campus, who<br />\nsponsored the \"gymboree.\" The purpose of the gym carnival, of course,<br />\nwas to raise enough funds to Make<br />\npossible the presentation of the varsity sweaters to those members of<br />\nthe football and basketball teams who<br />\ndeserve them. Unforttmate17, their<br />\ngoal was not fully realized\u2014not because this select group did not exert<br />\nenough efforts, but because they<br />\nwere dealing with a student body that<br />\nis spiritless and from whom wholehearted support can never be expected.<br />\nThe opportunity to refute that former editorial was practically placed<br />\nin the hands of the Hopkins student,<br />\nyet he failed to respond. As might be<br />\nexpected of such a spiritless body,<br />\ncondemnation had little effect. The<br />\ndiscouraging result of these concerted<br />\nefforts have moved the author of<br />\nthese editorials to the conclusion that<br />\nto instill spirit into a spiritless group<br />\nis analogous to instilling life into a<br />\nI.

Now that last statement would<br />\nseem to be confuted by nearly every<br />\nissue which the worthy owner of the<br />\npapers in question puts out. Of course<br />\nthis undoubtedly misses the whole<br />\npoint of the sticker's slogan. It was<br />\njust put there to arouse our curiosity<br />\nor our bile, and implied something<br />\nentirely different from it. apparent<br />\nstatement. But we think that any such<br />\nbroad statement deserves an explanation, and we ask the sticker-pasters<br />\nto give our readers one.<br />\nThe first statement, alleging the<br />\npromotion of race hatred, starts us<br />\nto thinking.

This was, however, disproved<br />\nby a certain spirited few, still remaining on the Hopkins campus, who<br />\nsponsored the \"gymboree.\" The purpose of the gym carnival, of course,<br />\nwas to raise enough funds to Make<br />\npossible the presentation of the varsity sweaters to those members of<br />\nthe football and basketball teams who<br />\ndeserve them. Unforttmate17, their<br />\ngoal was not fully realized\u2014not because this select group did not exert<br />\nenough efforts, but because they<br />\nwere dealing with a student body that<br />\nis spiritless and from whom wholehearted support can never be expected.<br />\nThe opportunity to refute that former editorial was practically placed<br />\nin the hands of the Hopkins student,<br />\nyet he failed to respond. As might be<br />\nexpected of such a spiritless body,<br />\ncondemnation had little effect. The<br />\ndiscouraging result of these concerted<br />\nefforts have moved the author of<br />\nthese editorials to the conclusion that<br />\nto instill spirit into a spiritless group<br />\nis analogous to instilling life into a<br />\nI.

Now that last statement would<br />\nseem to be confuted by nearly every<br />\nissue which the worthy owner of the<br />\npapers in question puts out. Of course<br />\nthis undoubtedly misses the whole<br />\npoint of the sticker's slogan. It was<br />\njust put there to arouse our curiosity<br />\nor our bile, and implied something<br />\nentirely different from it. apparent<br />\nstatement. But we think that any such<br />\nbroad statement deserves an explanation, and we ask the sticker-pasters<br />\nto give our readers one.<br />\nThe first statement, alleging the<br />\npromotion of race hatred, starts us<br />\nto thinking. (Well, it makes us wrinkle our brows, then.) We don't doubt<br />\nthat the -said newspapers stir up race<br />\nhatred (though we are inclined to<br />\nbelieve that that is merely a steppingstone to worse mire), but we wonder<br />\n\u2014what about the hatreds which the<br />\nsticker-pasters stir up?
