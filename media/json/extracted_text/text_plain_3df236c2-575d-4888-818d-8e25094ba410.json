Student antics<br />\nhave been an international phenomenon for a long while, whether<br />\nthey take the form of pipe smoking, beard growing or drinking<br />\ncontests, or just healthy mass riots. But there seems to be a<br />\nnational aversion to recognizing any but the lighter side of<br />\ncollegiate life:<br />\nFor this reason we were pleased to notice the national<br />\nrecognition given to the recent controversy about debating the<br />\naffirmative side of the question \"Should the 'United States Recognize Red China.\" For although the mere questioning of the right<br />\nto discuss this topic implies a misunderstanding of the idea behind<br />\ncollegiate debating and a disregard of the First Amendment,<br />\nit at least has brought to public attention the college student's<br />\nawareness of serious issues. \u2022<br />\nIt has been repOrted by the press that a Virginia Representative to the United States Congress attempted to influence a<br />\nstudent so that the student would refrain from debating the affirmative side of the national debating topic for this year. This is<br />\nnot only a flagrant violation of personal rights, but also another<br />\nof the many attempts to limit the sphere of free intellectual<br />\ninquiry..<br />\nOfficials of the Army and Navy have forbidden the debating<br />\nteams of West Point and Annapolis to take up the subject,<br />\ncontending that it is not befitting a potential officer to argue in<br />\ncontradiction of State Department Policy. This is to suggest that<br />\nit is improper for a potential officer (and a great number of<br />\ncollege students are) to disagree with that nebulous, vascillating<br />\nentity termed State Department Policy. This is a threat to free<br />\nexpression.<br />\nThe encouraging aspect of the issue is that an overwhelming<br />\nmajority of college officials, and even President Eisenhower,<br />\nhave given their approval to the proposed topic, an encouraging<br />\nsign to those concerned about the threatened loss of academic<br />\nfreedom. Perhaps more important is the evidence that the<br />\nAmerican college student has both the courage and seriousness<br />\nto be outspoken when he feels his rights curtailed.<br />\nIt is with relief that we note that Dean Shaffer has givea his<br />\nsupport to the proposed topic of debate. It is no less reassuring<br />\nthat this weekend the Homewood campus\\will be the scene of an<br />\nintercollegiate conference on Southeast Asia where students will<br />\nbe able to discuss without fear whatever topics their curiosity shall<br />\nlead them to.<br />\n<br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, December 10, 1954<br />\n<br />\n\"Several hundred dollars\" have<br />\nieen raised for the preservation<br />\nof Wyman Villa, according to<br />\nMiss Elizabeth .Packard, vicepresident of the Wyman Villa<br />\nfoundation.<br />\nSet up in March, 1952, for the<br />\npurpose of raising money to prevent the destruction of the old<br />\nbuilding located on the southwest<br />\ncorner of the campus behind<br />\nLevering Hall the foundation was<br />\nattempting to raise by early next<br />\nyear (1955) $145,000, which the<br />\nUniversity said was necessary for<br />\nthe complete renovation of the<br />\nstructure.<br />\nIn January, 1953, Mr. Charles<br />\nNiver, now secretary of the group,<br />\nwas quoted by the Sunpapers as<br />\nhaving said, \"The foundation is<br />\nprepared to raise the money as<br />\nsoon 1as it gets the green light<br />\nfrom Hopkins.\" Soon after the<br />\nWyman Foundation's period of grace ends early next year, leavi<br />\nUniversity agreed to .hold a final<br />\nfate<br />\nVilla between the devil and the deep blue sea.<br />\nof<br />\nwas<br />\nuntil<br />\nthe<br />\ngroup<br />\ndecision<br />\ngiven some time to raise money.<br />\nPfau, a master decorator who has needed for the restoration of 1<br />\n\u2022 The money so far raised by the<br />\nworked on many large Baltimore house, heating, and lighting; a<br />\nfoundation has been used for.<br />\nplanti<br />\nbuildings and churches, inspect $5,000 for the cost of<br />\nfireproofing and general repair of<br />\nthe Villa further.

Student antics<br />\nhave been an international phenomenon for a long while, whether<br />\nthey take the form of pipe smoking, beard growing or drinking<br />\ncontests, or just healthy mass riots. But there seems to be a<br />\nnational aversion to recognizing any but the lighter side of<br />\ncollegiate life:<br />\nFor this reason we were pleased to notice the national<br />\nrecognition given to the recent controversy about debating the<br />\naffirmative side of the question \"Should the 'United States Recognize Red China.\" For although the mere questioning of the right<br />\nto discuss this topic implies a misunderstanding of the idea behind<br />\ncollegiate debating and a disregard of the First Amendment,<br />\nit at least has brought to public attention the college student's<br />\nawareness of serious issues. \u2022<br />\nIt has been repOrted by the press that a Virginia Representative to the United States Congress attempted to influence a<br />\nstudent so that the student would refrain from debating the affirmative side of the national debating topic for this year. This is<br />\nnot only a flagrant violation of personal rights, but also another<br />\nof the many attempts to limit the sphere of free intellectual<br />\ninquiry..<br />\nOfficials of the Army and Navy have forbidden the debating<br />\nteams of West Point and Annapolis to take up the subject,<br />\ncontending that it is not befitting a potential officer to argue in<br />\ncontradiction of State Department Policy. This is to suggest that<br />\nit is improper for a potential officer (and a great number of<br />\ncollege students are) to disagree with that nebulous, vascillating<br />\nentity termed State Department Policy. This is a threat to free<br />\nexpression.<br />\nThe encouraging aspect of the issue is that an overwhelming<br />\nmajority of college officials, and even President Eisenhower,<br />\nhave given their approval to the proposed topic, an encouraging<br />\nsign to those concerned about the threatened loss of academic<br />\nfreedom. Perhaps more important is the evidence that the<br />\nAmerican college student has both the courage and seriousness<br />\nto be outspoken when he feels his rights curtailed.<br />\nIt is with relief that we note that Dean Shaffer has givea his<br />\nsupport to the proposed topic of debate.
