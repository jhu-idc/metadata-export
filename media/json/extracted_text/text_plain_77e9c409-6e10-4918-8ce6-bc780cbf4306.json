A<br />\nbudget crunch has caused the<br />\nschool to cut back on increases in<br />\nfaculty and some undergraduate<br />\ndepartments remain critically<br />\nunderstaffed in spite of the greater<br />\nstudent enrollment. In order to<br />\naccomodate the demands of a<br />\nlarger student body, many depart-<br />\n<br />\nments find it necessary to hire<br />\nvisiting professors to cover<br />\ncourses which cannot be taught<br />\nby the regular staff.<br />\nFor large departments supporting a great number of majors,<br />\nvisiting professors relieve the<br />\nload of the full-time faculty<br />\nmembers by taking over some<br />\nundergraduate courses. The<br />\nDepartment of Political Science,<br />\nwhich includes International<br />\nRelations, currently has sixteen<br />\nfull-time professors, while 493<br />\nstudents have majors in this area.<br />\nMatthew Crenson, chairman of<br />\nthe department, said that visiting<br />\n<br />\nDave Fox<br />\n<br />\nMayor of Baltimore City Kurt L. Schmoke at the Greater Homewood<br />\nRally Against Crime on Saturday, February 23.<br />\n<br />\nprofessors are the department's<br />\n\"salvation,\" and that without<br />\nthem there would not be enough<br />\ncourses offered by the department<br />\nfor all of the students who need<br />\nto register for them.<br />\nIn spite of the growing number<br />\nof students in the Department of<br />\nPolitical Science, Crenson is<br />\nsatisfied with the size of the permanent full-time faculty. He explained that a smaller staff is an<br />\nattraction, because it prevents the<br />\ndevelopment of bureaucracy.<br />\nThe disadvantage of relying on<br />\nvisiting professors to cover<br />\ncourses, he said, is the fact that<br />\nthese professors do not help with<br />\nthe administrative duties that the<br />\nregular professors are responsible for, such as holding office<br />\nhours for students, or serving as<br />\nadvisors or members of<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nCrenson views the system of<br />\nhaving visiting professors teach<br />\ncourses for a semester as a<br />\ndefinite asset to the department<br />\nand to the students. He points out<br />\nthat students have the opportunity to study under talented scholars<br />\nfrom highly respected institutions<br />\nacross the nation and around the<br />\nworld.<br />\nCrenson is also hopeful that<br />\nPresident Richardson's new proposal to have graduate students<br />\nteach courses will be an added<br />\nboost to the Department of<br />\nPolitical Science, relieving some<br />\nof the burden put upon the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\n<br />\n\"The main problem,\" he said,<br />\n\"is that our size is not adequate<br />\nto meet the student demand. But<br />\nwe deal with it the best we can.\"<br />\nCrenson also believes that<br />\nHopkins is ahead of other schools<br />\nthat are also experiencing the difficulty of limited faculty<br />\nresources, because, he said,\"We<br />\nhave been working on [the problem] longer and are closer to<br />\nfinding a solution.\"<br />\nThe Department of Writing<br />\nSeminars is another department<br />\nthat relies heavily upon visiting<br />\nprofessors. With five tenured<br />\nprofessors and one full-time professor on the staff, John Irwin,<br />\nthe department chairman, explained that there is \"no alternative\" but to hire visiting professors in order \"to respond to<br />\nstudent demands.\"<br />\nFourteen visiting professors are<br />\nteaching courses in the department this semester; many of them<br />\nhave taught courses before and<br />\ncome back regularly. While there<br />\nare now two positions open which<br />\nneed to be filled, the budget situation will delay such action<br />\nindefinitely.<br />\nIrwin, while expressing a concern that there are fewer faculty<br />\nmembers available to ha,-,dle administrative duties, also said that<br />\nthe visiting professors are a great<br />\nbenefit to students studying in the<br />\nDepartment of Writing Seminars.<br />\nThe extra teachers, he said, add<br />\nvariety because students are not<br />\nContinued on page 2<br />\n<br />\nCommunity Decries Charles Village<br />\nCrime At Shriver Hall Rally<br />\nby Harry Milling<br />\nEven though total on-campus<br />\nreported crimes have decreased in<br />\nthe last three years, a rally against<br />\ncrime was held at Shriver Hall on<br />\nFebruary 23 because residents of<br />\nCharles Village and the surrounding communities have perceived<br />\nan increase in crime in their<br />\nneighborhoods.<br />\nCommunity residents estimated<br />\nthat 168 residents from Northern<br />\nBaltimore attended the rally,<br />\nwhich consisted of a panel of<br />\ncity officials that was followed by<br />\na question-and-answer session.<br />\nActual attendance appeared to be<br />\ncloser to 75.<br />\nResidents from surrounding<br />\n<br />\nneighborhoods complained of<br />\ndrug dealers, but residents of<br />\nCharles Village mainly complained about theft.<br />\n\"We do not have crack houses<br />\nin our neighborhood.

He also said<br />\nthat military action threatens three<br />\nother goals stated by Secretary<br />\nBaker in the initial month of the<br />\ncrisis: restoring Kuwait, defending Saudi Arabia, and freeing the<br />\nwestern hostages then being held<br />\nin Iraq.<br />\nThe time has come to heal the<br />\nwounds caused by the war,<br />\naccording to Zogby. He believes<br />\nthis process will require much<br />\n\"creative diplomacy,\" but is<br />\npossible.<br />\nZogby listed five areas of<br />\nchallenge which the U.S. must<br />\ndeal with to establish a new world<br />\norder. He noted that such an<br />\norder would not be a Pax<br />\nAmericana, but rather a period of<br />\ninternational cooperation typified<br />\nby the recent US-Soviet cooperation and the multi-national coalition which formed against Iraq.<br />\nThe first challenge is Kuwait,<br />\naccording to Zogby. That nation<br />\nneeds aid in rebuilding, and it<br />\nmust be convinced not to seek<br />\nvengeful reparations against Iraq.<br />\nIf Kuwait punishes Iraq, Zogby<br />\nbelieves that, like Germany after<br />\nWorld War I, such punishments<br />\nwill only sow the seeds for<br />\nanother war.<br />\nHe emphasized that the freeing<br />\nof Kuwait was a moral objective.<br />\n\"The Kuwaiti people deserve to<br />\nbe liberated.\" In his mind, this<br />\nproves that the war was about<br />\nlarger issues, not \"just blood for<br />\noil.\"<br />\nThe U.S. and its allies should<br />\nassist Kuwait in building a more<br />\nopen and democratic society,<br />\nZogby said. Despite other problems in Kuwaiti society, he<br />\n<br />\nbelieves that institutions which<br />\nexisted prior to August 2, 1990,<br />\nsuch as the Parliament and the<br />\nfreest press in the Arab world,<br />\nprovide fertile ground for producing a more progressive society.<br />\nAccording to Zogby, the coalition must deal with Iraq and its<br />\nneighbors as a second challenge.<br />\nZogby is optimistic that eventually, given the right opportunity,<br />\nthe Iraqi people will choose a<br />\nmore pluralistic and open society and leadership.<br />\n\"If it is done properly, Iraq can<br />\nbe another Germany, rising from<br />\nthe ashes of war,\" he said.<br />\nTo insure the stability of the<br />\nMiddle East, Zogby believes that<br />\nit is vital to rebuild Iraq.

He said the resolution of<br />\nthe Palestinian question will go a<br />\nlong way toward resolving these<br />\nproblems.<br />\nA fifth issue, U.S.-Soviet relations, is the one in which the<br />\nstakes are highest, according to<br />\nZogby, because the Soviet Union<br />\nand the U.S. still possess the<br />\nweapons.to destroy each other.<br />\nHe said that the war created<br />\nsignificant strains in U.S.-Soviet<br />\nrelations, and had a definite impact on Soviet internal politics.<br />\n\"The Baltics,\" he said, \"were<br />\nthe first victims of the U.S.<br />\nmilitary build-up which occurred<br />\nin November.\" He said that<br />\nSoviet generals could not permit<br />\nthe U.S. build-up to go<br />\nunanswered, resulting in the<br />\ncrackdown in the Baltics.<br />\n\"If we are not careful, we will<br />\ngo not back to the future, but forward to the past. We may have<br />\ntaken a giant leap back to the<br />\nCold War,\" he said.<br />\nReconciliation between the<br />\nU.S. and the Soviet Union is<br />\nnecessary because both nations<br />\nneed each other, according to<br />\nZogby. The Soviets need our<br />\neconomic investment, he said,<br />\nand we need their assistance in<br />\n<br />\nestablishing a new, more peaceful<br />\nworld order.<br />\nZogby said that if the allies had<br />\nhad the patience to let the sanctions work, a peaceful and stable<br />\nMiddle East could have been<br />\nachieved more easily. \"Now we<br />\nhave to heal the wounds.\" But<br />\noverall, he said that he is optimistic that a new world order<br />\nstressing UN principles of human<br />\nrights can be established.<br />\nBrookings Institute scholar and<br />\nABC News analyst Judith Kipper<br />\nwas also scheduled to speak, but<br />\nshe was enroute to the Middle<br />\nEast to participate in ABC's<br />\ncoverage of the Gulf War.<br />\n<br />\nof relationships with the<br />\nsocieties.\" As a result, he said,<br />\n\"All institutions in society derive<br />\ntheir financial bases from the<br />\nstate.\" Independence from the<br />\nstate is minimal and armies<br />\ndominate the affairs of the state,<br />\nhe added.<br />\n\"Oil has become a series of<br />\nglobal connections which has<br />\nlinked the Middle East arena with<br />\ncontinual Western interference<br />\nand colonization tantamount to<br />\ndenying the people of the area<br />\ntheir rights,\" he said.<br />\nGhani demonstrated this by<br />\nway of a brief summary of the recent history of the Middle East.<br />\nHe described its colonization in<br />\nthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries in which the \"control of<br />\nresources did not stop with<br />\npolitical independence\" and<br />\nrelated how General Schwartzkopfs father overthrew the<br />\n\"legitimate regime of Iran,\" in<br />\n1953 and brought back the Shah.<br />\nGhani underscored the \"direct<br />\ndenial of rights by the West\" and<br />\npointed out that the continual<br />\npressure of conflict haunted the<br />\npeople with fear. This fear, he explained, forced leaders to use approximately forty percent of their<br />\nbudget since 1955 towards the<br />\npurchase of arms and turned the<br />\narea into an \"arsenal of<br />\nweapons. . .\"<br />\n\"Today with nuclear capability,\" he warned, Arab nations are<br />\n\"facing the danger of<br />\nextinction.\"<br />\n<br />\nGreeks Argue for Exemption<br />\nHousing Standards Proposed by Columbo<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\nsophomores, the fraternity would<br />\nbe forced to pressure upperclassmen to live in the house.<br />\nOf the thirty-eight brothers living<br />\nat Alpha Delta Phi (WAWA)<br />\nhouse, nearly one-third are<br />\nsophomores. In addition to the<br />\nfinancial difficulties that would be<br />\ncreated, one WAWA Ittroktiaer,<br />\nDoyle Ashburn, said that<br />\nsophomore Greeks unable to live<br />\nin their fraternity houses \"won't<br />\nfeel like they are as involved in<br />\nthe fraternity.\"<br />\nThe University acknowledges<br />\nthat fraternities would suffer<br />\nwithout a housing exemption, but<br />\nthat the Greek system nevertheless would survive. In its proposal, however, the IFC Housing<br />\nCommittee contends, \"It would<br />\nbe detrimental to the Greek<br />\nsystem at Johns Hopkins if no<br />\nalternative were given for<br />\nsophomore fraternity men and<br />\nsorority women.\" In an interview, Dean Columbo maintained, \"Our goal is to reach an<br />\nunderstanding.\"<br />\nIn the event that exemption<br />\n<br />\nfrom the sophomore housing<br />\npolicy is granted to Greek<br />\nmembers choosing to live in<br />\nfraternity-provided housing,<br />\nfraternities most likely will have<br />\nto agree to certain terms<br />\npredicated by the University.

As a<br />\nFreshman Representative, I<br />\nhave written the accepted Student Council policy on the<br />\nROTC issue. I am also a<br />\nmember of the Committee on<br />\nCommittees, which has introduced me to many administrators with whom I am<br />\nable to work effectively. I am attending the American Association of University Students' national convention from<br />\nFebruary 27 through March 3,<br />\n1991, in St. Louis, Missouri.<br />\nFrom this, I hope to gather a lot<br />\nof useful ideas for next year's<br />\nstudents to the best of my ability, and I look forward to an impressive year for the 1991-1992<br />\nCouncil.<br />\n<br />\nVice-President<br />\nSandeep K.

To this position I<br />\nbrought many personal leadership skills attained in high<br />\nschool where I served as the<br />\nStudent Council President.<br />\nServing on the Student government here at Hopkins has<br />\nenabled me to gain a first hand<br />\nview of the activities of council<br />\nwhile keeping an open mind<br />\nand supplying a voice on coun-<br />\n<br />\ncond, I seek to remain active on<br />\nCouncil itself as student<br />\nrepresentative.

During<br />\nthis time I have worked on<br />\nseveral Council projects, including AAUS,the ROTC committee, and constitutional revisions.

Se-<br />\n<br />\nDavid Dutot<br />\nI have been at Johns<br />\nHopkins for 2 1/2 years now,<br />\nand I have finally become<br />\nfrustrated enough to run for student government.

It does a<br />\nwhole lot of running, but never<br />\nseems to get anywhere. I want<br />\nto get the hamster off the wheel<br />\nand out of the cage to where<br />\nit can cause some trouble.<br />\nIt is impossible to say<br />\nanything of substance in about<br />\n100 words, so I won't insult<br />\nanyone's intelligence by trying<br />\nto do so.

She understood<br />\nsomewhat the necessity of learning sociology to better understand<br />\npsychology. She understood that<br />\nperhaps a basis in economics<br />\nmight make checkbook balancing<br />\na little easier. And perhaps, just<br />\nperhaps, quantum physics might<br />\nmake watching \"Twin Peaks\"<br />\nsomewhat comprehensible. But<br />\nshe couldn't see how sitting in a<br />\nroom for two hours telling<br />\nEnglish majors how to do their<br />\njob helped her any.<br />\nWorse than that, Miranda actually had to play the game and<br />\nwrite stories of her own. This<br />\nposed her the greatest difficulty,<br />\nbecause she wrote her stories<br />\nmotivated by only one thing, and<br />\nthat was to avoid the trap of the<br />\nEnglish major. Miranda would<br />\nnot write about sex or death.<br />\nShe looked at the packet of<br />\nstories she had had to read for today's class. Typical. Of the five<br />\nstories being workshopped that<br />\nday, hers being the fifth, there<br />\nwere two deaths, one sex, and<br />\none sex, and death story. Three<br />\nof the four were probably<br />\nautobiographical.<br />\nAs the class piled into the<br />\nroom, Miranda noted with disdain the attitudes of the people in<br />\nthe class. One, a small guy with<br />\na pair of leather rider boots, came<br />\nup to her and asked her what she<br />\nthought of his stoy between his<br />\nChocolate Kandy Kakes.<br />\n\"Won't we be going over them<br />\nin class?\"<br />\n\"Class is so phony. Everyone<br />\ntries to please the teacher. I write<br />\nfor myself, nobody else. Did you<br />\nlike it?\"<br />\nMiranda looked at her packet<br />\nand couldn't remember for the<br />\nlife of her who this guy was.<br />\n\"Which was yours?\"<br />\n\"The one about the guy who<br />\nkills himself.\"<br />\n\"The guy who jumped off the<br />\nbridge, or the guy who strangled<br />\nhimself with his girlfriend's<br />\n<br />\ngarter.\"<br />\n\"The garter.\"<br />\n\"Loved it.\"<br />\n\"Really? Thanks. What are<br />\nyou doing after class?\"<br />\n\"Bathing.\"<br />\n\"Oh. Maybe some other time,<br />\nthen.\"<br />\nAs he sat down and opened a<br />\npack of Twinkies, Miranda jotted a notation on the top of his<br />\nstory that read \"Criticize.\"<br />\nThe teacher, an ex-beatnik<br />\nwhose hair was longer than<br />\n<br />\n'What are you doing<br />\nafter class,' asked the<br />\nguy with leather rider<br />\nboots. 'Bathing,'<br />\nMiranda said.

The idea is a clever one\u2014it could close<br />\ngaps that the University can't afford to fill with professors at<br />\npresent\u2014but the thinking behind it raises questions about Armstrong's long-term priorities for this financially emaciated division of the University.<br />\nThe Dean's Teaching Fellowship Program, according to<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and Sciences Jacqueline Mitchell, is<br />\ngeared to provide the \"creme de la creme\" of graduate students<br />\nwith the opportunity to design and teach their own classes at<br />\nthe budget-cutting wage of $5,000 per course. Provided that<br />\nthe teaching is good, the program is an absolute dream for the<br />\nUniversity's finances, and in turn for Armstrong. By giving<br />\ngraduate students practical teaching experience at about twothirds the cost of paying a T.A., the dean can claim to be saving money even as he reduces the workload of beleaguered<br />\nfaculty members. As to the immediate concern that the quality<br />\nof teaching will decline, Associate Dean Michell said last week<br />\nthat \"The graduate [teacher] will work closely with and be<br />\nmonitored by their faculty member at all times, so the faculty<br />\nwill remain linked to undergraduates in turn.\"<br />\nGiven this set of reassurances in advance, and knowing the<br />\nhigh caliber of graduate education at Hopkins, everybody must<br />\nbe happy, right? Not quite. The News-Letter wonders: How<br />\nlong does Armstrong plan for this to go on? As it stands, the<br />\nTeaching Fellowship Program is only slated for the 1991-92<br />\nacademic year. But if Armstrong intends it as an annual pacifier<br />\nfor the problems within Arts and Sciences, then it is time for<br />\nundergraduates to cry wolf\u2014and before the TFP becomes institutionalized. The News-Letter sees several reasons why.<br />\nSome of the best courses at Johns Hopkins in recent years<br />\nhave been taught and designed by graduate students. These offer evidence that grad student teachers are not automatically<br />\nthe inferiors of their post-doctoral counterparts. In fact, Lloyd<br />\nArmstrong's prediction the TFP fellows will \"work their hearts<br />\nOut\" has usually proved true; grads are often much more conscientious than tenured faculty. Still, problems are more likely to arise with graduate student teachers than with full-time<br />\nfaculty members, and one wonders what being \"monitored\"<br />\nby a faculty member really means. If a TFP fellow is discovered<br />\n<br />\ndoing an abysmal job four weeks into a class, and the supervising faculty member learns about it, what will he or she do?<br />\nIt depends on the options. If that professor has to step in and<br />\nteach the class by him or herself, most student complaints will<br />\nlikely be ignored. The News-Letter hopes that, at a minimum,<br />\nDean Armstrong will establish unilateral standards\u2014and particularly high ones\u2014for faculty supervision of TFP fellows that<br />\nhe will share with the University community.<br />\nSecond, Armstrong and everyone else involved with the program should recall that its objective is to provide undergraduates<br />\nwith the highest quality education. Since the TFP was announced, several administrators have gone on record touting it as a<br />\ngreat opportunity for graduate students to gain teaching experience. Perhaps, but Hopkins undergraduates aren't here to<br />\nbe laboratory subjects for Experiments in Teaching 101. If Armstrong wants to make the program do real work, he should concentrate it in departments with conspicuous and unnecessary<br />\ngaps\u2014Biology and Psychology come quick to mind\u2014rather than<br />\nin those with defacto TFP programs already in place, as they<br />\nare in several Humanities departments.<br />\nThird, the TFP is no substitute for courses taught by fulltime faculty members. Regardless of the program's success,<br />\nthe graduate student who teaches an excellent class will be a<br />\npleasant surprise, nothing more. The strength of an academic<br />\ndepartment, and of a university as a whole, doesn't grow from<br />\na trickle-down theory of education. Associate Dean Mitchell's<br />\nassertion that \"faculty will remain linked to the undergraduates\"<br />\nthrough supervising TFP fellows is a lame one. Undergraduates<br />\nhad problems enough connecting with faculty members before<br />\nthe latest fiscal austerity measures were imposed. The TFP<br />\nwon't improve that situation.<br />\nMost important, the TFP moves the University no closer to<br />\nsolving its fundamental problems: shortage of funds, subsequent<br />\nshortages of faculty members and research money, and a profound discontent among the faculty. This program is no panacea,<br />\nand no innovation either: several departments have been using<br />\ngraduate students as teaching fellows for years, with mixed<br />\nresults. If Lloyd Armstrong wants to give the concept a special<br />\nbudget, and parade it around as the Arts and Sciences' new<br />\nclothes, he is clearly free to do so. But the News-Letter hopes<br />\nthat the TFP sees a mercifully brief life span; that it is used<br />\nonly in departments where it is badly needed; and that it frees<br />\nup the time for Armstrong to solve some of the real problems<br />\nfacing this University. Undergraduates, and indeed faculty<br />\nmembers, should expect nothing less.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nThe 'Buffoonery' of Major Larkin; Things Not Learned<br />\n(Or Not Heard) at the Teach-In; News-Letter Contempt<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nMajor Larkin: irengagifig in<br />\nsophistry and buffoonery of the<br />\nworst kind when he claims that<br />\nSecurity has a strong interest in protecting the students at Hopkins.<br />\nLarkin states that he has \"never<br />\nread in the News-Letter about the<br />\nthree (3)[sic] Security Escort Vans<br />\nwe operate year round from 5:00<br />\np.m. till 3:00 a.m.\" That may be,<br />\nbut only because Larkin is an inattentive reader. In my \"Screw the<br />\nRight Thing\" column of October 26,<br />\n1990, I mentioned the vans, admittedly in the context of criticizing<br />\nSecurity for its poor performance.<br />\nApparently Larkin would like to<br />\nrewrite the facts to fit with his<br />\ndistorted, paranoid vision of the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nLarkin further employs obfuscatory tactics when he cites the<br />\noperating hours of the vans. Most of<br />\nthe school is probably unaware that<br />\non Sunday, February, 16\u2014the morning of the latest rape\u2014only one van<br />\nwas running between 2 and 3 a.m.<br />\nThe other two drivers were let go at<br />\n2 a.m., according to the switchboard<br />\noperator I spoke to around 2:30 a.m.<br />\nNeed I remind Larkin that the rape<br />\noccured around 2:30?<br />\nWhile it is impossible to say<br />\nwhether the woman who was raped<br />\nwould have even used the escort<br />\nservice\u2014had it been running at its<br />\ntouted hours\u2014but is it not conceivable that more students would<br />\nuse the service if it were run more<br />\nefficiently, i.e., at least during its<br />\nstated operating hours? Can Larkin<br />\njustify this poor service and his later<br />\nlie (or misrepresentation, if you<br />\nprefer, but I don't) about said<br />\nservice?<br />\nAbout the training and sensitivity<br />\nof the officers: I question both,<br />\nmainly as a result of the unwarranted<br />\ntreatment I received at their hands<br />\n(literally!) when one officer violently<br />\ngrabbed my neck while I was participating in a non-violent act of civil<br />\ndisobedience on December 4, 1990.<br />\nAccording to Dean of Homewood<br />\nSchools Services Chris Colombo,<br />\nSecurity is trained in riot control,<br />\nwhich indicates that Security knows<br />\nonly how to respond once things<br />\nhave gotten out of hand. If they knew<br />\nhow to re.:,<br />\ntr) demonstrations (as<br />\ntheir past actions have shown they<br />\ndo not) perhaps Security would not<br />\nbe in the pathetic position of instigating animosity among the<br />\n\"Hopkins Community.\"<br />\nIn other matters, Larkin is also involved in half-truths. Maybe the<br />\nCampus Crime Report was published for years, but the Community<br />\nCrime Report only saw print last fall<br />\n<br />\nin an effort to alert students to the<br />\ndangers that exist in the areas surrounding the campus after Security<br />\ndisplayed its impotence beyond the<br />\nboundaries of Homewood proper.<br />\nLarkin's assertion that Security is<br />\n\"very sensitive to the needs and problems of our student body\" is disingenuous, but what I've come to<br />\nexpect from an office that uses propaganda and outright lies more than<br />\nadmissions or housing.<br />\nI see that Larkin didn't use his outdated honorific, a feeble attempt to<br />\ninspire jingoistic respect for a former<br />\nmilitary figure. Maybe he has realized that even he can't capitalize on the<br />\nquestionable reputation that armed<br />\nforces have earned themselves.<br />\nStephen Kent Jusick<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs one of the organizers of the<br />\nFebruary teach-in on the war held on<br />\ncampus, I want to respond to<br />\nStephen Spencer's ill-considered<br />\ncomments in his letter of 22<br />\nFebruary. He claimed we didn't<br />\nshow any desire to communicate<br />\nwith the bulk of people on campus,<br />\nand that our forum was not an open<br />\none. He's wrong.<br />\nIn organizing the event, we<br />\nsaturated faculty mailboxes<br />\nthroughout the university with invitations, asking professors if they<br />\nwanted to speak. We solicited individual faculty members who had<br />\ncommented publicly on the war<br />\nalready, or who we thought had<br />\nsome expertise on a particular subject related to the war. We solicited<br />\nno one expressly to give a simple<br />\npro- or anti-war statement. What the<br />\nspeakers in fact said was up to them,<br />\nas we did not ask to see anyone's<br />\ncomments before the teach-in. At<br />\nthis moment I am not sure what position all of the speakers take on the<br />\nwar issue itself\u2014they did not all<br />\nmake their positions clear in their<br />\n<br />\npresentations, though most certainly did. Furthermore, we sought and<br />\ngot a pledge from a staff member of<br />\nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee to speak (he had recently been<br />\nin Iraq, and we thought he might<br />\nhave something interesting to say),<br />\nregardless of our speculation that he<br />\nwas pro-war; the Committee staff<br />\nbacked out at the last minute, indicating their fear of open discussion, not ours.<br />\nFinally, both pro- and anit-war<br />\nmembers of the audience\u2014an audience of hundreds\u2014got a chance to<br />\nspeak at the teach-in. I'm sorry if<br />\nMr. Spencer didn't find the<br />\narguments advanced by those prowar participants as persuasive as I'm<br />\nsure his own (as yet unheard?)<br />\narguments are, and I'm sorry he<br />\nforgot this detail.<br />\nI never cease to feel amazed at<br />\nthose in the majority who feel<br />\nthreatened by any expression of dissent, who inexplicably see all such<br />\ndissent as somehow dogmatic, and<br />\nwho demand that the minority view<br />\nalways be accompanied by a rebuttal from the imperilled majority.<br />\nFree discussion guarantees the opportunity to speak, but cannot<br />\nguarantee such parity.

The editors also noted that, if<br />\nI was willing to express my opinions<br />\nso freely, I would also have to be<br />\nwilling to accept criticisms.<br />\nUnfortunately, the News-Letter<br />\n(News-Gazette?) of the past few<br />\nweeks has completely forgotten its<br />\nown advice, climaxing in its longest<br />\neditorial of the year last week.

Do real newspapers waste so<br />\nmuch ink, especially in lead<br />\neditorials, in attempts to discredit<br />\nsuch petty and \"false\" accusations?<br />\nAdditionally, the extremely sarcastic and mean-spirited \"Editors'<br />\nNotes\" which have followed letters<br />\nwith increasing frequency this<br />\nsemester\u2014the same kind of response<br />\nI was warned against making\u2014seem<br />\nto have no intention except to mock<br />\nand/or discredit.

This \"National Energy<br />\nStrategy\" (NES) calls for increasing oil production, encouraging the use of natural gas,<br />\nsubsidizing nuclear power plants,<br />\nand building a new generation of<br />\ncoal-fired plants. But what is<br />\nmost telling about the NES is<br />\nwhat it doesn't say. At a time<br />\nwhen more and more Americans<br />\nare realizing the importance of<br />\nconserving energy and reducing<br />\nour dependence of fossil fuels,<br />\nthis energy policy says nothing<br />\nabout it. The Union of Concerned Scientists reported in<br />\nDecember that three out of four<br />\nAmericans favored -reducing demand for fossil fuels, rather than<br />\nincreasing supply,\" and eight out<br />\nof ten favored \"increasing<br />\nautomobile fuel-economy standards to 40 mpg by the year<br />\n2000.\"<br />\nThe NES, in an attempt to<br />\nreduce the United States<br />\ndependency on imported oil, calls<br />\nfor opening up the Artie National<br />\nWildlife Refuge, one of the last<br />\npristine areas in the U.S. The ex-<br />\n<br />\nploitations of ANWR is a shortterm solution at best, since 65<br />\npercent of the world's oil supply<br />\nlies under the Middle East and<br />\nonly 4 percent lies in U.S. territory. According to the Department of Interior, if all the<br />\nundeveloped U.S. oil fields were<br />\ndeveloped, they would supply the<br />\nU.S. oil needs for only two years.<br />\nUntil the U.S. is no longer dependent on oil, oil supply will continue to be a national security<br />\nproblem.<br />\nThe NES also supports<br />\nbuilding a new generation of coalburning power plants. Eighty-five<br />\npercent of sulfur dioxide emissions directly or indirectly caused by human beings come from<br />\nburning coal, yet the NES has no<br />\nprovisions for pollution control.<br />\nThe NES does support switching to natural gas. Although<br />\nnatural gas generates less carbon<br />\ndioxide per joule produced than<br />\ncoal or oil, it is still a fossil fuel<br />\nand contributes significantly to<br />\nthe greenhouse effect. In fact, 75<br />\npercent of the human impact on<br />\ncarbon dioxide emissions is from<br />\nburning fossil fuels. The U.S.<br />\n<br />\nil Ili%<br />\n11111141.41 vp<br />\n<br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\nalready emits more carbon dioxide than the other seven most industrialized nations combined.<br />\nWhile Western Europe has plans<br />\nto cut its emissions of carbon<br />\ndioxide, the NES will end up increasing U.S. emissions.<br />\nNuclear power does not spew<br />\ncarbon or sulfur dioxide, but it<br />\ndoes create radioactive waste, and<br />\nit does have a history of accidents. Nuclear power is a<br />\ndangerous toy. The NES will increase subsidies to nuclear power<br />\nplants while decreasing regulations on quality control and<br />\ndisposal of hazardous radioactive<br />\nwaste. Despite numerous recent<br />\nscandals in the Nuclear<br />\nRegulatory Commission, the<br />\ngovernment agency responsible<br />\nfor regulating nuclear safety, the<br />\nNES \"streamlines\" the licensing<br />\nprocess for nuclear power plants<br />\nand lowers the importance of environmental impact assessments.<br />\nThe nuclear reactors built over<br />\n<br />\nthe last decades are reaching the<br />\nend of their lifespan and will have<br />\nto be decommissioned. Dismantling each of these reactors will<br />\nproduce enough radioactive waste<br />\nto cover a football field thirteen<br />\n<br />\ntally dangerous energy sources<br />\nsuch as solar\", wind,- and geothermal power are discouraged by the<br />\nNES.

In order for the United<br />\nStates to decrease our contribution to the greenhouse effect by<br />\n20 percent, we would have to<br />\nbuild 1 nuclear reactor every<br />\nthree days for the next 40 years.<br />\nIn contrast to fossil fuels and<br />\nnuclear power, less environmen-<br />\n<br />\nother eight most industrialized nations.

We<br />\nshould note that according to<br />\nScientific American: \"Federal<br />\nenergy research could be restored<br />\nto its 1980 level by raising the<br />\ngasoline tax a mere 3 cents a<br />\ngallon,\" and that in 1980 the<br />\nenergy research budget was a<br />\nmere $6 billion.

I also hope to introduce<br />\ncreative methods to fund these<br />\nprograms to relieve the University from some, if not all, of the<br />\nfinancial burden.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has and will<br />\ncontinue to be an important part<br />\nof my life. Your support will permit me to continue my candidacy<br />\nfor Young Trustee and place me<br />\nin a position to be considered for<br />\nappointment to the body, which<br />\nsets policies for all University<br />\naffairs.<br />\nGreg Gagnon<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University has recently been reacting to<br />\nthe wants and desires of the student body. It is, however, unfortunate that some of this may have<br />\nbeen done in an effort to more effectively compete with other<br />\nschools for students. After a<br />\nperiod of increased enrollment,<br />\nHopkins has found that it must<br />\ndraw in others with attractive<br />\namenities. This is yet in the<br />\nshadow of the Five Year Plan, of<br />\nwhich we are in the middle stage<br />\nat this point. With this in mind,<br />\nI would like to run as Young<br />\nTrustee because, as a member of<br />\nthe decision-making process at<br />\nHopkins, it is important that there<br />\nwill be someone who will act out<br />\nof genuine concern. I want to effect reasonable change\u2014change<br />\nwhich should have already have<br />\nhappened before the Class of<br />\n1991 came to Hopkins but has<br />\nnot. I want to find the classes<br />\nfollowing us to enjoy that which<br />\nwe could not.<br />\nThe changes we have seen so<br />\nfar are a step in the right direction. As Young Trustee, I want<br />\nto make sure Hopkins gets its<br />\nmoney's worth. Our physical<br />\nfacilities and fiscal policies should<br />\nboth be sound, and neither should<br />\naccrue unnecessary debt. Our<br />\nstaff should be given every consideration, whether they have<br />\ntenure or work in Levering<br />\nMarket\u2014no one's working conditions should be dismissed. I emphasize the positive aspects of the<br />\nUniversity's growth on all sides,<br />\nincluding the Medical School. I<br />\nwould like to work in cooperation<br />\nwith Dr. Richardson and help<br />\nhim to direct our University in the<br />\nbest path possible. I will not,<br />\nhowever, allow myself to be constricted to any one end, but will<br />\nbe a strong advocate for policies<br />\nwhich will benefit the Graduate<br />\nand Undergraduate Schools here<br />\nat Hopkins. Vote for Greg<br />\nGagnon, Young Trustee.<br />\nSuzy Kim<br />\nThe position of Young Trustee<br />\noffers a distinctive opportunity<br />\nfor a graduating senior to par-<br />\n<br />\nticipate in the decision-making<br />\nprocess of the University. I would<br />\nlike to serve as Young Trustee to<br />\ncontinue my active involvement<br />\nwith Hopkins. I feel that I am<br />\nuniquely qualified for this position because of the range of my<br />\nexperience with various organizations and with different administrative offices on campus.<br />\nI have been fortunate in my<br />\nHopkins career to serve for two<br />\nyears as Housemaster, as Student<br />\nAdvising Co-Chairperson, as a<br />\nmember of the Committee on<br />\nHuman Relations and Cultural<br />\nDiversity, as Parliamentarian and<br />\nRituals Chair of Phi Mu, as a<br />\nBlue Key Tourguide and Student<br />\nPanelist, as a member of the<br />\nHomewood Schools Services Advisory Committee serving on the<br />\nDean of Students Sub-Committee<br />\nand the Substance Abuse-Health<br />\nServices Sub-Committee, as an<br />\nAdmissions Representative to the<br />\nExecutive Committee of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University Alumni Council.<br />\nDue to my involvement with<br />\nthe different facets of this University, I have gained valuable insight into its inner workings. I<br />\nhope to implement this<br />\nknowledge in the future development of our school.<br />\nKelly A. Mansfield<br />\nWhy do we elect a Young<br />\nTrustee? This position was<br />\ncreated to provide a youthful<br />\nvoice in the operation of our<br />\nUniversity. As a Young Trustee,<br />\na thorough understanding of this<br />\ninstitution is required, as well as<br />\na genuine respect for the<br />\nuniqueness of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAs Co-Chairman of the 1991<br />\nSpring Fair, I feel that I have<br />\nalready begun to take an active<br />\nrole in improving student life. My<br />\ngoals for this year's Fair were to<br />\nprovide students with an even<br />\ngreater opportunity for involvement. Yet, I realized that the Fair<br />\nis not only for the students, but<br />\nalso for Baltimore. Consequently, Spring Fair will be increasing<br />\ntheir charitable donations. The<br />\ncombination of more student involvement and better awareness<br />\nof the Baltimore community can<br />\nonly help Johns Hopkins. Having<br />\nbeen a tour guide for over three<br />\nyears, I know all the different<br />\nfacets of Hopkins. Each tour that<br />\nI give increases my appreciation<br />\nfor the University and its<br />\nphilosophy. I feel that my<br />\nknowledge and respect for the<br />\nUniversity can add much to the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br />\nAs 1 prepare to graduate, I want<br />\nto begin my four years again. As<br />\nYoung Trustee, I want to work<br />\ntowards a student climate where<br />\neach student, like myself, never<br />\nwants to leave.<br />\n<br />\nKathy Korbuly<br />\nMunia Mitra<br />\nI see the position of Young<br />\nTrustee as a way of giving<br />\nsomething back to Johns<br />\nHopkins. As a Sophomore and<br />\nJunior Class Representative on<br />\nStudent Council, I began my<br />\ncommitment to improving the<br />\nquality of undergraduate life. By<br />\nworking first to strengthen my<br />\nclass, I gained insight into many<br />\nof the important issues involving<br />\nthe entire Homewood campus.<br />\nBesides working with other<br />\nstudents, my positions on Student<br />\nCouncil and the Homewood<br />\nSchools Services Advisory Committee have helped me to develop<br />\na better understanding of the administration's point of view.<br />\nFrom working to ensure adequate<br />\nhousing, to trying to promote<br />\nGreek life with the addition of a<br />\nthird sorority, I've always been<br />\ndedicated to the undergraduates.<br />\nAs a Young Trustee, I hope to<br />\ncontinue this commitment to<br />\nJohns Hopkins long after- I<br />\ngraduate.<br />\n<br />\nstudent from each division of the<br />\nUniversity. This committee<br />\ndiscusses problems that the<br />\nUniversity faces like health insurance for all students to child<br />\ncare for students who are also<br />\nparents.<br />\nAs the Young Trustee, I will<br />\nvoice my opinion for stronger<br />\nfund raising for a Student Union<br />\non the Homewood campus and<br />\nfor expansion of the Athletic<br />\nCenter. I will also support increasing efforts in recruiting<br />\nminority faculty, students, and<br />\nadministrators. I will not support<br />\nincreasing the number of<br />\nundergraduate students at<br />\nHomewood to help lower the<br />\ndeficit. These are issues that I<br />\nhave either supported or not supported as Student Council President, but as Young Trustee my<br />\nvoice will carry more weight. I<br />\nwill also make a strong effort to<br />\nkeep the lines of communication<br />\nopen between the undergraduates<br />\nand the Board of Trustees. I<br />\nwould appreciate your support.<br />\nJeffrey M. Perlstein<br />\n<br />\nBob Nelson<br />\nI am running for this position<br />\nbecause I feel that I am very<br />\nqualified to serve as the Young<br />\nTrustee. A Young Trustee not only must be knowledgeable about<br />\nconcerns on Homewood Campus<br />\nbut also the issues that affect the<br />\nother divisions of the University.<br />\nAs the undergraduate representative on the Provost Search<br />\nCommittee, I worked with faculty<br />\nand administrators from all divisions and learned what problems<br />\nthe divisions face individually. A<br />\nYoung Trustee should also be experienced in working with the administration. As Student Council<br />\nPresident this past year, I met<br />\nwith Deans Armstrong and<br />\nVandeLinde almost monthly and<br />\nwith President Richardson<br />\nbimonthly. I also serve on the<br />\nUniversity Students Advisory<br />\nCommittee, which is chaired by<br />\nthe Provost and consists of one<br />\n<br />\nMy name is Jeff Perlstein and<br />\nI am running for the position of<br />\nYoung Trustee because I feel that<br />\nI would be a strong representative<br />\nof the undergraduate community<br />\nto the Board of Trustees. I have<br />\nbeen actively involved in many<br />\ndifferent facets of life at<br />\nHomewood throughout our four<br />\nyears here. More importantly, I<br />\nhave a solid record of student advocacy on vital campus issues and<br />\nhave no qualms about voicing a<br />\ndissenting opinion in favor of<br />\nundergraduates. As a Student<br />\nCouncil representative this year,<br />\nand as secretary under Lou<br />\nGiangiulio on Council last year,<br />\nI have a firm grasp of the relevant issues as well as experience<br />\nworking with administrators on<br />\nbehalf of the student population.<br />\nIf chosen as Young Trustee, I<br />\nwould expect to contribute<br />\nsubstantially to the quality of life<br />\nContinued on page 10<br />\n<br />\nhe John's tlopkin5 Univervty<br />\n<br />\nRoadwork Present<br />\n<br />\nBARN<br />\n22A 5TORMER5<br />\n<br />\nHOLLY<br />\n<br />\nvaclav<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n\u25aa<br />\n\u2713<br />\n<br />\nA CELEBRATION<br />\nOF INTERNATIONAL<br />\nWOMEN'S<br />\nDAY<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nTickets:<br />\nLambda Rising Bookstores<br />\n1625 Connecticut Ave.<br />\nWashington, D.C.<br />\nand<br />\n241 W.

Robinson, Jr.<br />\nMy desire to be involved in the<br />\nongoing activities of the University and my residence in the<br />\nBaltimore/Washington area are<br />\nthe reasons why I have decided<br />\nto seek the Young Trustee position. Though I recognize that the<br />\ntype of involvement will be<br />\nmarkedly different than that as an<br />\nundergraduate, a Young Trustee<br />\ncan only benefit from his/her experiences as a student. I would<br />\nlike to apply what I have learned<br />\nwhile working with students,<br />\nUniversity staff, and the community in attempting to represent<br />\nour perspective. This will be<br />\nfacilitated because I plan to live<br />\nnear Baltimore so I see this as a<br />\nwonderful opportunity to remain<br />\ninformed about issues affecting<br />\nJohns Hopkins\u2014particularly<br />\nthose related to undergraduates.<br />\nThis could also be a chance to<br />\ncommunicate with students about<br />\nthe role of the Trustees and their<br />\npolicies and help promote a better understanding between the<br />\ntwo. After four years at Hopkins,<br />\nI am prepared to depart, but I<br />\nwould look forward to serving as<br />\nthe next Young Trustee.<br />\nMatthew Randall Rosengart<br />\nAs current Secretary of Student<br />\nCouncil, I serve as the bridge between the faculty, higher adiiiiiiistration, council, and the student body. I seek to involve<br />\nmyself in the issues concerning<br />\nboth the University, present and<br />\nfuture, and the student body at<br />\nlarge. As diverse as my extracurriculars may appear, they possess<br />\none common thread; my efforts<br />\nlink the student body, Universi-<br />\n<br />\nty and community. As<br />\nHousemaster, I represent the<br />\nUniversity policies to freshmen;<br />\nhowever, in turn, I voice their<br />\nopinions and concerns to the administration. As an active<br />\nmember of the Alpha Tau Omega<br />\nfraternity, I am sensitive to the<br />\nneeds of the community as well.<br />\nWhile I represent the University<br />\nto the community, I also serve to<br />\nrelay the concerns of the community back to the school. As a<br />\nformer tutor for high school<br />\nstudents in the surrounding area,<br />\nI present a positive and exciting<br />\nperspective of the University and<br />\nthe success of its students. My<br />\namiability, gregarity, and genuine<br />\nconcern for the University as a<br />\nwhole, are qualities needed by a<br />\nYoung Trustee, and they are attributes I will continue to possess<br />\nas I maintain the link between the<br />\nUniversity, student body, and<br />\ncommunity in fulfilling the<br />\nposition.<br />\nJennifer D. Sharp<br />\nThis University is comprised of<br />\nmany parts, making it impossible<br />\nfor each person on the Board of<br />\nTrustees to know and understand<br />\nall aspects of the Hopkins community in order to make appropriate decisions for the<br />\nUniversity. Instead, each member<br />\nbrings his own knowledge and<br />\nexperience to the Board, so that<br />\ncollectively its members may<br />\nmake decisions which ensure that<br />\nour institution maintains its<br />\nrespected place within the<br />\nacademic community. It is the<br />\nYoung Trustees who provide the<br />\nRoard with insight to the thoughts<br />\nid feelings of the student<br />\npopulation, and who ensure the<br />\nundergraduates that their views<br />\nare expressed to and heard by the<br />\nBoard.<br />\nThe past three and a half years<br />\nof my undergraduate career have<br />\nprepared me well for the position<br />\nof Young Trustee. My academic<br />\n<br />\nbackground is engineering; I also<br />\nhave a strong humanities<br />\nbackground and have taken advantage of opportunities at<br />\nPeabody. More importantly, having been involved in athletics,<br />\nResidential Life, the Arts and<br />\nGreek life, I have worked extensively with students at all levels,<br />\nwhich has provided me the<br />\nknowledge and understanding of<br />\nstudent concerns. As a Young<br />\nTrustee, I will represent Hopkins<br />\nstudents and, if nothing else, help<br />\nothers on the Board of Trustees<br />\nto understand student views.<br />\nI would be naive to expect that<br />\nby serving as Young Trustee, I<br />\ncan change Hopkins and \"do<br />\ngreat things\" for the University.<br />\nI am only one person, but that<br />\ndoes not mean that I cannot make<br />\na difference.<br />\nMichele Lynn Wolf<br />\nThrough my undergraduate experiences at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, I believe I have<br />\ndeveloped some of the necessary<br />\nskills that would allow me to be<br />\nqualified for the position of<br />\nYoung Trustee. As an active<br />\nmember of this campus, I have<br />\nlearned how to work with<br />\nstudents, faculty and administrators, and I have become<br />\nknowledgeable about issues that<br />\nface us, the students, and the<br />\nUniversity as a whole.<br />\nAs Vice President of Student<br />\nCouncil this year and a member<br />\nfor the past three, I know about<br />\nthe issues concerning students,<br />\nand I have worked to try and<br />\nalleviate some of the problems we<br />\nhave faced. While as a Community Assistant, Student Advising<br />\nCo-Chair for Orientation '89, and<br />\nBlue Key Tour Guide, I have<br />\ngained a good understanding of<br />\nthe Hopkins community. I want<br />\nto work with the Board of<br />\nTrustees on the issues of faculty<br />\ncuts, class size, and tuition increases. I horie we can bring back<br />\n<br />\nAmerican<br />\nGreen<br />\nContinued from page 7<br />\neach dollar of GNP, Japan uses<br />\none half the amount of energy the<br />\nU.S. requires. This is the effect<br />\nof Japan's national energy<br />\nstrategy which emphasizes<br />\nenergy conservation and energy<br />\nefficiency. Since the oil shock of<br />\nthe early 1970s Japan has cut its<br />\noil use by 75 percent, and, at the<br />\nsame time, doubled its GNP. If<br />\nthe U.S. used oil as efficiently as<br />\nJapan, we would only use 40 percent of the oil we need now.<br />\nJapan has stressed its energy efficiency strategy on industry, but<br />\ntwo-thirds of American oil consumption is in the transportation<br />\nindustry. We are addicted to our<br />\ncars. The National Energy<br />\nStrategy, in planning for future<br />\ntransportation, includes a plan to<br />\nexpand the highway system,<br />\npossibly as much as doubling its<br />\nsize. There is no mention of mass<br />\ntransportation. Even limiting the<br />\ndiscussion to cars, the NES calls<br />\nfor no increase in Federal fuelefficiency standards. It demands<br />\nthe average mileage of the new<br />\ncar fleet be 27 mpg. This means<br />\nthat some new cars will get even<br />\nless than this. A sense of perspective: A new Geo and the new<br />\nHonda Civic get more than 50<br />\nmpg. These are mid-priced,<br />\n<br />\nmass- produced, production line<br />\ncars, not prototypes.<br />\nWeathering one's home is<br />\nanother way that energy can be<br />\nsaved easily. Yet, rebates from<br />\nutility companies for energy conservation are now treated as partially taxable income, instead of<br />\nbeing tax deductions as they once<br />\nwere.

Oh, and<br />\nKathy, you're the best.<br />\n<br />\nupwardly-mobile path from wedding/obituary writers to the most<br />\npopular editorial pair in<br />\nBaltimore. They are so popular,<br />\nin fact, that their faces make it onto the side of an MTA bus\u2014big<br />\nstuff in this city. Their new-found<br />\nfame relies on their insistent opposition, and similarly, the fun of<br />\nthis movie depends on the<br />\ndiscrepancies between their two<br />\naccounts of the romance\u2014from<br />\nits start to its almost-finish. For<br />\nthose of you who have yet to get<br />\nit, what He Said is not what She<br />\nSaid.<br />\nThe movie does play on a<br />\ndisheartening amount of malefemale stereotyping. We first see<br />\nDan as the swinging playboy<br />\nbachelor; he juggles women on<br />\nthe staff of the paper until Lone<br />\nmanages to snare his attention<br />\naway. Dan harbors a more<br />\nserious romantic interest in the<br />\ncharacter of Linda (played by<br />\nSharon Stone\u2014women will hate<br />\nher because of her agonizing<br />\nbeauty), who we find has just<br />\nreturned from Paris. Linda's a<br />\nfashion designer, which makes<br />\nyou ask what she is doing in<br />\nBaltimore. That issue aside, she<br />\nremains a threat throughout the<br />\nmovie.<br />\nThe conflict in the romance<br />\nrests on the question of commitment: Lone wants it, Dan<br />\ndoesn't. A four-star moment in<br />\nthe film occurs during the \"He<br />\nSaid\" rendition of the first date,<br />\nwhich takes place at an Italian<br />\nrestaurant.(One detail of the relationship that they both agree on.)<br />\nIn a daydream sequence, Dan<br />\nlooks over the menu and, to his<br />\nhorror, discovers the only things<br />\non it are monogamy, commit-<br />\n<br />\nment, marriage, and children.<br />\nPanicked, he asks the waiter,<br />\n\"Can't I just get a side order of<br />\nsex?\"<br />\nThe conflict between commitment and freedom is one that may<br />\npervade the \"modern relationship,\" but in this movie one<br />\nyearns for a change from its usual<br />\ndepiction. For example, why<br />\ncouldn't Lone be asking for the<br />\n\"side order of sex\" while Dan<br />\nbegs at her feet for a wedding,<br />\nchildren, and The Big White<br />\nHouse? And why is it Dan whose<br />\nfidelity is in question? One<br />\ndesperately wishes that this Dan<br />\nperson be replaced by the likes of<br />\nMel Gibson. Audiences would<br />\ndefinitely be less inundated with<br />\nthe Bacon smirk.<br />\nAlthough He Said, She Said<br />\ndoes make use of popular<br />\nstereotypes which are somewhat<br />\npredictable and disappointing, the<br />\nfilm as a whole provides quality<br />\nentertainment. There's a small<br />\ncerebral<br />\nin<br />\nchallenge<br />\ndistinguishing the differences between the two characters' renditions of the relationship, and it's<br />\nfun when obscured messages<br />\nfrom the first part of the film<br />\nreveal themselves in the<br />\nsecond\u2014the \"highway merger,\"<br />\nfor example.(Major symbolism,<br />\nfigure it out.y What the film<br />\nleaves you with is an optimistic<br />\nfeeling about the state of affairs<br />\nbetween the sexes, and who<br />\ndoesn't need that every once in<br />\na while?

The Barnstormers made it look easy,<br />\nworking exceptionally well<br />\nrecreate<br />\nto<br />\ntogether<br />\nShakespeare's enchanted world.<br />\nMost noteworthy of the performances was Noel Schively's portrayal of Bottom the Weaver. His<br />\nstage presence (and booming<br />\nvoice) carried to the walls of the<br />\ntheatre, reaching its height in the<br />\nridiculous play-within-a-play<br />\ngiven to the court's newlyweds.<br />\nWhile his performance was<br />\nboisterous and bold, he still exerted enough control to make<br />\nBottom both lovable and<br />\nlaughable.<br />\nAlmost as prominent was<br />\nKathy Koski, who played the<br />\nsprite Puck with devilish<br />\nmischief. Her impish grin, coupled with an innocent quality,<br />\nworked well to breathe life into<br />\nthe role. In one of her better<br />\nscenes, she looked gleefully down<br />\non the mischief she had caused,<br />\nas the drugged Lysander and<br />\nDemetrius professed their undying love for a confused Helena.<br />\nThe four drug-crossed lovers:<br />\nLysander (Tim Woodard),<br />\n<br />\nale4411414r..<br />\n<br />\nming, showing her strengths in<br />\nthe hilarious love scene with the<br />\ntransformed Bottom.

School here in Maryland.<br />\nFollowing the opening of John<br />\nCarol!, Father Riepe attended<br />\nworking sessions of the Vatican<br />\nCouncil II in Rome.<br />\nIn the community he has served as Rector of the Cathedral of<br />\nMary Our Queen on Charles<br />\nStreet. Most recently he was Rec-<br />\n<br />\ntor and Headmaster of St. Sebastian's Country Day School. He<br />\ntaught a course on liturgy at St.<br />\nMary's Seminary and the University of Baltimore. He currently<br />\nserves as chaplain of the<br />\nBaltimore County Police.<br />\nFather Riepe has also been active in several publications, including The Mass of the Roman<br />\nRite, The People 's Mass Book,<br />\nand Living the Christian Seasons.<br />\nHe has also contributed articles<br />\nto Worship and The Catholic<br />\nReview.<br />\nConcern for the community<br />\nalso motivated Father Riepe to<br />\nconduct rehabilitation programs<br />\nfor drug offenders in Harford<br />\nCounty. He presided over Mann<br />\nHouse, Inc., a halfway house for<br />\nalcoholics in Bel Air, and was<br />\nresponsible for its purchase by the<br />\ncounty. It is no wonder, then, that<br />\nin 1976, Father Riepe was named Harford County's \"Man of the<br />\nYear\" by The Aegis newspaper.<br />\nBack on campus, Father Riepe<br />\nhas conducted Catholic mass<br />\nevery Sunday since September, at<br />\n11 A.M. in the Glass Pavilion.<br />\n<br />\nHe also heads the Catholic Community's weekly \"Newman<br />\nNight.\" Every Tuesday evening<br />\nat the Newman House on 2941<br />\nNorth Charles Street starts with<br />\na student-served dinner at 6 P.M.<br />\nDiscussion follows at 7 P.M.

Alas, the<br />\ndesserts aren't nearly as yummy as<br />\nthey sound. For starters,<br />\nTamber's only has four flavors of<br />\nice cream: vanilla, chocolate,<br />\nstrawberry, and coffee. The malt<br />\nwas like sucking soft ice cream<br />\nthrough a straw. Strawberry topping is closer to preserves than a<br />\nsauce. And the hot fudge is cold<br />\nand obnoxiously sweet.<br />\nThe service, like the ice cream,<br />\nwas disappointing. Orders (particularly ice cream) were often<br />\nscrewed up.

A<br />\nbudget crunch has caused the<br />\nschool to cut back on increases in<br />\nfaculty and some undergraduate<br />\ndepartments remain critically<br />\nunderstaffed in spite of the greater<br />\nstudent enrollment. In order to<br />\naccomodate the demands of a<br />\nlarger student body, many depart-<br /><br />\nments find it necessary to hire<br />\nvisiting professors to cover<br />\ncourses which cannot be taught<br />\nby the regular staff.<br />\nFor large departments supporting a great number of majors,<br />\nvisiting professors relieve the<br />\nload of the full-time faculty<br />\nmembers by taking over some<br />\nundergraduate courses. The<br />\nDepartment of Political Science,<br />\nwhich includes International<br />\nRelations, currently has sixteen<br />\nfull-time professors, while 493<br />\nstudents have majors in this area.<br />\nMatthew Crenson, chairman of<br />\nthe department, said that visiting<br /><br />\nDave Fox<br /><br />\nMayor of Baltimore City Kurt L. Schmoke at the Greater Homewood<br />\nRally Against Crime on Saturday, February 23.<br /><br />\nprofessors are the department's<br />\n\"salvation,\" and that without<br />\nthem there would not be enough<br />\ncourses offered by the department<br />\nfor all of the students who need<br />\nto register for them.<br />\nIn spite of the growing number<br />\nof students in the Department of<br />\nPolitical Science, Crenson is<br />\nsatisfied with the size of the permanent full-time faculty. He explained that a smaller staff is an<br />\nattraction, because it prevents the<br />\ndevelopment of bureaucracy.<br />\nThe disadvantage of relying on<br />\nvisiting professors to cover<br />\ncourses, he said, is the fact that<br />\nthese professors do not help with<br />\nthe administrative duties that the<br />\nregular professors are responsible for, such as holding office<br />\nhours for students, or serving as<br />\nadvisors or members of<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nCrenson views the system of<br />\nhaving visiting professors teach<br />\ncourses for a semester as a<br />\ndefinite asset to the department<br />\nand to the students. He points out<br />\nthat students have the opportunity to study under talented scholars<br />\nfrom highly respected institutions<br />\nacross the nation and around the<br />\nworld.<br />\nCrenson is also hopeful that<br />\nPresident Richardson's new proposal to have graduate students<br />\nteach courses will be an added<br />\nboost to the Department of<br />\nPolitical Science, relieving some<br />\nof the burden put upon the<br />\nfaculty.<br /><br />\n\"The main problem,\" he said,<br />\n\"is that our size is not adequate<br />\nto meet the student demand. But<br />\nwe deal with it the best we can.\"<br />\nCrenson also believes that<br />\nHopkins is ahead of other schools<br />\nthat are also experiencing the difficulty of limited faculty<br />\nresources, because, he said,\"We<br />\nhave been working on [the problem] longer and are closer to<br />\nfinding a solution.\"<br />\nThe Department of Writing<br />\nSeminars is another department<br />\nthat relies heavily upon visiting<br />\nprofessors. With five tenured<br />\nprofessors and one full-time professor on the staff, John Irwin,<br />\nthe department chairman, explained that there is \"no alternative\" but to hire visiting professors in order \"to respond to<br />\nstudent demands.\"<br />\nFourteen visiting professors are<br />\nteaching courses in the department this semester; many of them<br />\nhave taught courses before and<br />\ncome back regularly. While there<br />\nare now two positions open which<br />\nneed to be filled, the budget situation will delay such action<br />\nindefinitely.<br />\nIrwin, while expressing a concern that there are fewer faculty<br />\nmembers available to ha,-,dle administrative duties, also said that<br />\nthe visiting professors are a great<br />\nbenefit to students studying in the<br />\nDepartment of Writing Seminars.<br />\nThe extra teachers, he said, add<br />\nvariety because students are not<br />\nContinued on page 2<br /><br />\nCommunity Decries Charles Village<br />\nCrime At Shriver Hall Rally<br />\nby Harry Milling<br />\nEven though total on-campus<br />\nreported crimes have decreased in<br />\nthe last three years, a rally against<br />\ncrime was held at Shriver Hall on<br />\nFebruary 23 because residents of<br />\nCharles Village and the surrounding communities have perceived<br />\nan increase in crime in their<br />\nneighborhoods.<br />\nCommunity residents estimated<br />\nthat 168 residents from Northern<br />\nBaltimore attended the rally,<br />\nwhich consisted of a panel of<br />\ncity officials that was followed by<br />\na question-and-answer session.<br />\nActual attendance appeared to be<br />\ncloser to 75.<br />\nResidents from surrounding<br /><br />\nneighborhoods complained of<br />\ndrug dealers, but residents of<br />\nCharles Village mainly complained about theft.<br />\n\"We do not have crack houses<br />\nin our neighborhood.

He also said<br />\nthat military action threatens three<br />\nother goals stated by Secretary<br />\nBaker in the initial month of the<br />\ncrisis: restoring Kuwait, defending Saudi Arabia, and freeing the<br />\nwestern hostages then being held<br />\nin Iraq.<br />\nThe time has come to heal the<br />\nwounds caused by the war,<br />\naccording to Zogby. He believes<br />\nthis process will require much<br />\n\"creative diplomacy,\" but is<br />\npossible.<br />\nZogby listed five areas of<br />\nchallenge which the U.S. must<br />\ndeal with to establish a new world<br />\norder. He noted that such an<br />\norder would not be a Pax<br />\nAmericana, but rather a period of<br />\ninternational cooperation typified<br />\nby the recent US-Soviet cooperation and the multi-national coalition which formed against Iraq.<br />\nThe first challenge is Kuwait,<br />\naccording to Zogby. That nation<br />\nneeds aid in rebuilding, and it<br />\nmust be convinced not to seek<br />\nvengeful reparations against Iraq.<br />\nIf Kuwait punishes Iraq, Zogby<br />\nbelieves that, like Germany after<br />\nWorld War I, such punishments<br />\nwill only sow the seeds for<br />\nanother war.<br />\nHe emphasized that the freeing<br />\nof Kuwait was a moral objective.<br />\n\"The Kuwaiti people deserve to<br />\nbe liberated.\" In his mind, this<br />\nproves that the war was about<br />\nlarger issues, not \"just blood for<br />\noil.\"<br />\nThe U.S. and its allies should<br />\nassist Kuwait in building a more<br />\nopen and democratic society,<br />\nZogby said. Despite other problems in Kuwaiti society, he<br /><br />\nbelieves that institutions which<br />\nexisted prior to August 2, 1990,<br />\nsuch as the Parliament and the<br />\nfreest press in the Arab world,<br />\nprovide fertile ground for producing a more progressive society.<br />\nAccording to Zogby, the coalition must deal with Iraq and its<br />\nneighbors as a second challenge.<br />\nZogby is optimistic that eventually, given the right opportunity,<br />\nthe Iraqi people will choose a<br />\nmore pluralistic and open society and leadership.<br />\n\"If it is done properly, Iraq can<br />\nbe another Germany, rising from<br />\nthe ashes of war,\" he said.<br />\nTo insure the stability of the<br />\nMiddle East, Zogby believes that<br />\nit is vital to rebuild Iraq.

She understood<br />\nsomewhat the necessity of learning sociology to better understand<br />\npsychology. She understood that<br />\nperhaps a basis in economics<br />\nmight make checkbook balancing<br />\na little easier. And perhaps, just<br />\nperhaps, quantum physics might<br />\nmake watching \"Twin Peaks\"<br />\nsomewhat comprehensible. But<br />\nshe couldn't see how sitting in a<br />\nroom for two hours telling<br />\nEnglish majors how to do their<br />\njob helped her any.<br />\nWorse than that, Miranda actually had to play the game and<br />\nwrite stories of her own. This<br />\nposed her the greatest difficulty,<br />\nbecause she wrote her stories<br />\nmotivated by only one thing, and<br />\nthat was to avoid the trap of the<br />\nEnglish major. Miranda would<br />\nnot write about sex or death.<br />\nShe looked at the packet of<br />\nstories she had had to read for today's class. Typical. Of the five<br />\nstories being workshopped that<br />\nday, hers being the fifth, there<br />\nwere two deaths, one sex, and<br />\none sex, and death story. Three<br />\nof the four were probably<br />\nautobiographical.<br />\nAs the class piled into the<br />\nroom, Miranda noted with disdain the attitudes of the people in<br />\nthe class. One, a small guy with<br />\na pair of leather rider boots, came<br />\nup to her and asked her what she<br />\nthought of his stoy between his<br />\nChocolate Kandy Kakes.<br />\n\"Won't we be going over them<br />\nin class?\"<br />\n\"Class is so phony. Everyone<br />\ntries to please the teacher. I write<br />\nfor myself, nobody else. Did you<br />\nlike it?\"<br />\nMiranda looked at her packet<br />\nand couldn't remember for the<br />\nlife of her who this guy was.<br />\n\"Which was yours?\"<br />\n\"The one about the guy who<br />\nkills himself.\"<br />\n\"The guy who jumped off the<br />\nbridge, or the guy who strangled<br />\nhimself with his girlfriend's<br /><br />\ngarter.\"<br />\n\"The garter.\"<br />\n\"Loved it.\"<br />\n\"Really? Thanks. What are<br />\nyou doing after class?\"<br />\n\"Bathing.\"<br />\n\"Oh. Maybe some other time,<br />\nthen.\"<br />\nAs he sat down and opened a<br />\npack of Twinkies, Miranda jotted a notation on the top of his<br />\nstory that read \"Criticize.\"<br />\nThe teacher, an ex-beatnik<br />\nwhose hair was longer than<br /><br />\n'What are you doing<br />\nafter class,' asked the<br />\nguy with leather rider<br />\nboots.

The idea is a clever one\u2014it could close<br />\ngaps that the University can't afford to fill with professors at<br />\npresent\u2014but the thinking behind it raises questions about Armstrong's long-term priorities for this financially emaciated division of the University.<br />\nThe Dean's Teaching Fellowship Program, according to<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and Sciences Jacqueline Mitchell, is<br />\ngeared to provide the \"creme de la creme\" of graduate students<br />\nwith the opportunity to design and teach their own classes at<br />\nthe budget-cutting wage of $5,000 per course. Provided that<br />\nthe teaching is good, the program is an absolute dream for the<br />\nUniversity's finances, and in turn for Armstrong. By giving<br />\ngraduate students practical teaching experience at about twothirds the cost of paying a T.A., the dean can claim to be saving money even as he reduces the workload of beleaguered<br />\nfaculty members. As to the immediate concern that the quality<br />\nof teaching will decline, Associate Dean Michell said last week<br />\nthat \"The graduate [teacher] will work closely with and be<br />\nmonitored by their faculty member at all times, so the faculty<br />\nwill remain linked to undergraduates in turn.\"<br />\nGiven this set of reassurances in advance, and knowing the<br />\nhigh caliber of graduate education at Hopkins, everybody must<br />\nbe happy, right? Not quite. The News-Letter wonders: How<br />\nlong does Armstrong plan for this to go on? As it stands, the<br />\nTeaching Fellowship Program is only slated for the 1991-92<br />\nacademic year. But if Armstrong intends it as an annual pacifier<br />\nfor the problems within Arts and Sciences, then it is time for<br />\nundergraduates to cry wolf\u2014and before the TFP becomes institutionalized. The News-Letter sees several reasons why.<br />\nSome of the best courses at Johns Hopkins in recent years<br />\nhave been taught and designed by graduate students. These offer evidence that grad student teachers are not automatically<br />\nthe inferiors of their post-doctoral counterparts. In fact, Lloyd<br />\nArmstrong's prediction the TFP fellows will \"work their hearts<br />\nOut\" has usually proved true; grads are often much more conscientious than tenured faculty. Still, problems are more likely to arise with graduate student teachers than with full-time<br />\nfaculty members, and one wonders what being \"monitored\"<br />\nby a faculty member really means. If a TFP fellow is discovered<br /><br />\ndoing an abysmal job four weeks into a class, and the supervising faculty member learns about it, what will he or she do?<br />\nIt depends on the options. If that professor has to step in and<br />\nteach the class by him or herself, most student complaints will<br />\nlikely be ignored. The News-Letter hopes that, at a minimum,<br />\nDean Armstrong will establish unilateral standards\u2014and particularly high ones\u2014for faculty supervision of TFP fellows that<br />\nhe will share with the University community.<br />\nSecond, Armstrong and everyone else involved with the program should recall that its objective is to provide undergraduates<br />\nwith the highest quality education. Since the TFP was announced, several administrators have gone on record touting it as a<br />\ngreat opportunity for graduate students to gain teaching experience. Perhaps, but Hopkins undergraduates aren't here to<br />\nbe laboratory subjects for Experiments in Teaching 101. If Armstrong wants to make the program do real work, he should concentrate it in departments with conspicuous and unnecessary<br />\ngaps\u2014Biology and Psychology come quick to mind\u2014rather than<br />\nin those with defacto TFP programs already in place, as they<br />\nare in several Humanities departments.<br />\nThird, the TFP is no substitute for courses taught by fulltime faculty members. Regardless of the program's success,<br />\nthe graduate student who teaches an excellent class will be a<br />\npleasant surprise, nothing more. The strength of an academic<br />\ndepartment, and of a university as a whole, doesn't grow from<br />\na trickle-down theory of education. Associate Dean Mitchell's<br />\nassertion that \"faculty will remain linked to the undergraduates\"<br />\nthrough supervising TFP fellows is a lame one. Undergraduates<br />\nhad problems enough connecting with faculty members before<br />\nthe latest fiscal austerity measures were imposed. The TFP<br />\nwon't improve that situation.<br />\nMost important, the TFP moves the University no closer to<br />\nsolving its fundamental problems: shortage of funds, subsequent<br />\nshortages of faculty members and research money, and a profound discontent among the faculty. This program is no panacea,<br />\nand no innovation either: several departments have been using<br />\ngraduate students as teaching fellows for years, with mixed<br />\nresults. If Lloyd Armstrong wants to give the concept a special<br />\nbudget, and parade it around as the Arts and Sciences' new<br />\nclothes, he is clearly free to do so. But the News-Letter hopes<br />\nthat the TFP sees a mercifully brief life span; that it is used<br />\nonly in departments where it is badly needed; and that it frees<br />\nup the time for Armstrong to solve some of the real problems<br />\nfacing this University. Undergraduates, and indeed faculty<br />\nmembers, should expect nothing less.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nThe 'Buffoonery' of Major Larkin; Things Not Learned<br />\n(Or Not Heard) at the Teach-In; News-Letter Contempt<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nMajor Larkin: irengagifig in<br />\nsophistry and buffoonery of the<br />\nworst kind when he claims that<br />\nSecurity has a strong interest in protecting the students at Hopkins.<br />\nLarkin states that he has \"never<br />\nread in the News-Letter about the<br />\nthree (3)[sic] Security Escort Vans<br />\nwe operate year round from 5:00<br />\np.m. till 3:00 a.m.\" That may be,<br />\nbut only because Larkin is an inattentive reader. In my \"Screw the<br />\nRight Thing\" column of October 26,<br />\n1990, I mentioned the vans, admittedly in the context of criticizing<br />\nSecurity for its poor performance.<br />\nApparently Larkin would like to<br />\nrewrite the facts to fit with his<br />\ndistorted, paranoid vision of the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nLarkin further employs obfuscatory tactics when he cites the<br />\noperating hours of the vans. Most of<br />\nthe school is probably unaware that<br />\non Sunday, February, 16\u2014the morning of the latest rape\u2014only one van<br />\nwas running between 2 and 3 a.m.<br />\nThe other two drivers were let go at<br />\n2 a.m., according to the switchboard<br />\noperator I spoke to around 2:30 a.m.<br />\nNeed I remind Larkin that the rape<br />\noccured around 2:30?<br />\nWhile it is impossible to say<br />\nwhether the woman who was raped<br />\nwould have even used the escort<br />\nservice\u2014had it been running at its<br />\ntouted hours\u2014but is it not conceivable that more students would<br />\nuse the service if it were run more<br />\nefficiently, i.e., at least during its<br />\nstated operating hours? Can Larkin<br />\njustify this poor service and his later<br />\nlie (or misrepresentation, if you<br />\nprefer, but I don't) about said<br />\nservice?<br />\nAbout the training and sensitivity<br />\nof the officers: I question both,<br />\nmainly as a result of the unwarranted<br />\ntreatment I received at their hands<br />\n(literally!) when one officer violently<br />\ngrabbed my neck while I was participating in a non-violent act of civil<br />\ndisobedience on December 4, 1990.<br />\nAccording to Dean of Homewood<br />\nSchools Services Chris Colombo,<br />\nSecurity is trained in riot control,<br />\nwhich indicates that Security knows<br />\nonly how to respond once things<br />\nhave gotten out of hand. If they knew<br />\nhow to re.:,<br />\ntr) demonstrations (as<br />\ntheir past actions have shown they<br />\ndo not) perhaps Security would not<br />\nbe in the pathetic position of instigating animosity among the<br />\n\"Hopkins Community.\"<br />\nIn other matters, Larkin is also involved in half-truths. Maybe the<br />\nCampus Crime Report was published for years, but the Community<br />\nCrime Report only saw print last fall<br /><br />\nin an effort to alert students to the<br />\ndangers that exist in the areas surrounding the campus after Security<br />\ndisplayed its impotence beyond the<br />\nboundaries of Homewood proper.<br />\nLarkin's assertion that Security is<br />\n\"very sensitive to the needs and problems of our student body\" is disingenuous, but what I've come to<br />\nexpect from an office that uses propaganda and outright lies more than<br />\nadmissions or housing.<br />\nI see that Larkin didn't use his outdated honorific, a feeble attempt to<br />\ninspire jingoistic respect for a former<br />\nmilitary figure. Maybe he has realized that even he can't capitalize on the<br />\nquestionable reputation that armed<br />\nforces have earned themselves.<br />\nStephen Kent Jusick<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs one of the organizers of the<br />\nFebruary teach-in on the war held on<br />\ncampus, I want to respond to<br />\nStephen Spencer's ill-considered<br />\ncomments in his letter of 22<br />\nFebruary. He claimed we didn't<br />\nshow any desire to communicate<br />\nwith the bulk of people on campus,<br />\nand that our forum was not an open<br />\none. He's wrong.<br />\nIn organizing the event, we<br />\nsaturated faculty mailboxes<br />\nthroughout the university with invitations, asking professors if they<br />\nwanted to speak. We solicited individual faculty members who had<br />\ncommented publicly on the war<br />\nalready, or who we thought had<br />\nsome expertise on a particular subject related to the war. We solicited<br />\nno one expressly to give a simple<br />\npro- or anti-war statement. What the<br />\nspeakers in fact said was up to them,<br />\nas we did not ask to see anyone's<br />\ncomments before the teach-in. At<br />\nthis moment I am not sure what position all of the speakers take on the<br />\nwar issue itself\u2014they did not all<br />\nmake their positions clear in their<br /><br />\npresentations, though most certainly did. Furthermore, we sought and<br />\ngot a pledge from a staff member of<br />\nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee to speak (he had recently been<br />\nin Iraq, and we thought he might<br />\nhave something interesting to say),<br />\nregardless of our speculation that he<br />\nwas pro-war; the Committee staff<br />\nbacked out at the last minute, indicating their fear of open discussion, not ours.<br />\nFinally, both pro- and anit-war<br />\nmembers of the audience\u2014an audience of hundreds\u2014got a chance to<br />\nspeak at the teach-in. I'm sorry if<br />\nMr. Spencer didn't find the<br />\narguments advanced by those prowar participants as persuasive as I'm<br />\nsure his own (as yet unheard?)<br />\narguments are, and I'm sorry he<br />\nforgot this detail.<br />\nI never cease to feel amazed at<br />\nthose in the majority who feel<br />\nthreatened by any expression of dissent, who inexplicably see all such<br />\ndissent as somehow dogmatic, and<br />\nwho demand that the minority view<br />\nalways be accompanied by a rebuttal from the imperilled majority.<br />\nFree discussion guarantees the opportunity to speak, but cannot<br />\nguarantee such parity.

My reaction, though, to the<br />\nfirst letter was itself quite vehement.<br />\nI found the points of the letter<br />\nlaughably absurd, yet I also saw in<br />\nthem false accusations which, in my<br />\nmind, necessitated a reply from me,<br /><br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

The editors also noted that, if<br />\nI was willing to express my opinions<br />\nso freely, I would also have to be<br />\nwilling to accept criticisms.<br />\nUnfortunately, the News-Letter<br />\n(News-Gazette?) of the past few<br />\nweeks has completely forgotten its<br />\nown advice, climaxing in its longest<br />\neditorial of the year last week. Out<br />\nof all the issues which face this campus, did clarifying the trivial<br />\n\"mistakes\" of others justify claiming more editorial space that did<br />\nprevious editorials about ROTC or<br />\nthe decline of the undergraduate<br />\neducation?<br />\nBy writing this very defensive<br />\neditorial instead of allowing these<br />\npractically unnoticed comments to<br />\nstand by themselves, the News-Letter<br />\nhas merely demonstrated that it is<br />\noperating under a siege of mentality. Do real newspapers waste so<br />\nmuch ink, especially in lead<br />\neditorials, in attempts to discredit<br />\nsuch petty and \"false\" accusations?<br />\nAdditionally, the extremely sarcastic and mean-spirited \"Editors'<br />\nNotes\" which have followed letters<br />\nwith increasing frequency this<br />\nsemester\u2014the same kind of response<br />\nI was warned against making\u2014seem<br />\nto have no intention except to mock<br />\nand/or discredit. Those who took the<br />\ntime to write to the News-Letter do<br />\nnot do so out of a driftless boredom,<br />\nbut rather do so out of some concern,<br />\nno matter how small, for a particular<br />\nissue. The editors themselves may<br />\nbelieve that a letter deals with trivial<br />\nissues, but if that's the case, then<br />\nwhy not let it stand as is instead of<br />\nmaking an issue out of it?

This \"National Energy<br />\nStrategy\" (NES) calls for increasing oil production, encouraging the use of natural gas,<br />\nsubsidizing nuclear power plants,<br />\nand building a new generation of<br />\ncoal-fired plants. But what is<br />\nmost telling about the NES is<br />\nwhat it doesn't say. At a time<br />\nwhen more and more Americans<br />\nare realizing the importance of<br />\nconserving energy and reducing<br />\nour dependence of fossil fuels,<br />\nthis energy policy says nothing<br />\nabout it. The Union of Concerned Scientists reported in<br />\nDecember that three out of four<br />\nAmericans favored -reducing demand for fossil fuels, rather than<br />\nincreasing supply,\" and eight out<br />\nof ten favored \"increasing<br />\nautomobile fuel-economy standards to 40 mpg by the year<br />\n2000.\"<br />\nThe NES, in an attempt to<br />\nreduce the United States<br />\ndependency on imported oil, calls<br />\nfor opening up the Artie National<br />\nWildlife Refuge, one of the last<br />\npristine areas in the U.S. The ex-<br /><br />\nploitations of ANWR is a shortterm solution at best, since 65<br />\npercent of the world's oil supply<br />\nlies under the Middle East and<br />\nonly 4 percent lies in U.S. territory. According to the Department of Interior, if all the<br />\nundeveloped U.S. oil fields were<br />\ndeveloped, they would supply the<br />\nU.S. oil needs for only two years.<br />\nUntil the U.S. is no longer dependent on oil, oil supply will continue to be a national security<br />\nproblem.<br />\nThe NES also supports<br />\nbuilding a new generation of coalburning power plants. Eighty-five<br />\npercent of sulfur dioxide emissions directly or indirectly caused by human beings come from<br />\nburning coal, yet the NES has no<br />\nprovisions for pollution control.<br />\nThe NES does support switching to natural gas. Although<br />\nnatural gas generates less carbon<br />\ndioxide per joule produced than<br />\ncoal or oil, it is still a fossil fuel<br />\nand contributes significantly to<br />\nthe greenhouse effect. In fact, 75<br />\npercent of the human impact on<br />\ncarbon dioxide emissions is from<br />\nburning fossil fuels. The U.S.<br /><br />\nil Ili%<br />\n11111141.41 vp<br /><br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\nalready emits more carbon dioxide than the other seven most industrialized nations combined.<br />\nWhile Western Europe has plans<br />\nto cut its emissions of carbon<br />\ndioxide, the NES will end up increasing U.S. emissions.<br />\nNuclear power does not spew<br />\ncarbon or sulfur dioxide, but it<br />\ndoes create radioactive waste, and<br />\nit does have a history of accidents. Nuclear power is a<br />\ndangerous toy. The NES will increase subsidies to nuclear power<br />\nplants while decreasing regulations on quality control and<br />\ndisposal of hazardous radioactive<br />\nwaste. Despite numerous recent<br />\nscandals in the Nuclear<br />\nRegulatory Commission, the<br />\ngovernment agency responsible<br />\nfor regulating nuclear safety, the<br />\nNES \"streamlines\" the licensing<br />\nprocess for nuclear power plants<br />\nand lowers the importance of environmental impact assessments.<br />\nThe nuclear reactors built over<br /><br />\nthe last decades are reaching the<br />\nend of their lifespan and will have<br />\nto be decommissioned. Dismantling each of these reactors will<br />\nproduce enough radioactive waste<br />\nto cover a football field thirteen<br /><br />\ntally dangerous energy sources<br />\nsuch as solar\", wind,- and geothermal power are discouraged by the<br />\nNES.

It's a dangerous toy.<br /><br />\nfeet deep. No matter what the<br />\nNES says, nuclear power is no<br />\nanswer. In order for the United<br />\nStates to decrease our contribution to the greenhouse effect by<br />\n20 percent, we would have to<br />\nbuild 1 nuclear reactor every<br />\nthree days for the next 40 years.<br />\nIn contrast to fossil fuels and<br />\nnuclear power, less environmen-<br /><br />\nother eight most industrialized nations.

Your support will permit me to continue my candidacy<br />\nfor Young Trustee and place me<br />\nin a position to be considered for<br />\nappointment to the body, which<br />\nsets policies for all University<br />\naffairs.<br />\nGreg Gagnon<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University has recently been reacting to<br />\nthe wants and desires of the student body. It is, however, unfortunate that some of this may have<br />\nbeen done in an effort to more effectively compete with other<br />\nschools for students. After a<br />\nperiod of increased enrollment,<br />\nHopkins has found that it must<br />\ndraw in others with attractive<br />\namenities. This is yet in the<br />\nshadow of the Five Year Plan, of<br />\nwhich we are in the middle stage<br />\nat this point. With this in mind,<br />\nI would like to run as Young<br />\nTrustee because, as a member of<br />\nthe decision-making process at<br />\nHopkins, it is important that there<br />\nwill be someone who will act out<br />\nof genuine concern. I want to effect reasonable change\u2014change<br />\nwhich should have already have<br />\nhappened before the Class of<br />\n1991 came to Hopkins but has<br />\nnot. I want to find the classes<br />\nfollowing us to enjoy that which<br />\nwe could not.<br />\nThe changes we have seen so<br />\nfar are a step in the right direction. As Young Trustee, I want<br />\nto make sure Hopkins gets its<br />\nmoney's worth. Our physical<br />\nfacilities and fiscal policies should<br />\nboth be sound, and neither should<br />\naccrue unnecessary debt. Our<br />\nstaff should be given every consideration, whether they have<br />\ntenure or work in Levering<br />\nMarket\u2014no one's working conditions should be dismissed. I emphasize the positive aspects of the<br />\nUniversity's growth on all sides,<br />\nincluding the Medical School. I<br />\nwould like to work in cooperation<br />\nwith Dr. Richardson and help<br />\nhim to direct our University in the<br />\nbest path possible. I will not,<br />\nhowever, allow myself to be constricted to any one end, but will<br />\nbe a strong advocate for policies<br />\nwhich will benefit the Graduate<br />\nand Undergraduate Schools here<br />\nat Hopkins.

I would<br />\nlike to serve as Young Trustee to<br />\ncontinue my active involvement<br />\nwith Hopkins. I feel that I am<br />\nuniquely qualified for this position because of the range of my<br />\nexperience with various organizations and with different administrative offices on campus.<br />\nI have been fortunate in my<br />\nHopkins career to serve for two<br />\nyears as Housemaster, as Student<br />\nAdvising Co-Chairperson, as a<br />\nmember of the Committee on<br />\nHuman Relations and Cultural<br />\nDiversity, as Parliamentarian and<br />\nRituals Chair of Phi Mu, as a<br />\nBlue Key Tourguide and Student<br />\nPanelist, as a member of the<br />\nHomewood Schools Services Advisory Committee serving on the<br />\nDean of Students Sub-Committee<br />\nand the Substance Abuse-Health<br />\nServices Sub-Committee, as an<br />\nAdmissions Representative to the<br />\nExecutive Committee of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University Alumni Council.<br />\nDue to my involvement with<br />\nthe different facets of this University, I have gained valuable insight into its inner workings. I<br />\nhope to implement this<br />\nknowledge in the future development of our school.<br />\nKelly A. Mansfield<br />\nWhy do we elect a Young<br />\nTrustee? This position was<br />\ncreated to provide a youthful<br />\nvoice in the operation of our<br />\nUniversity. As a Young Trustee,<br />\na thorough understanding of this<br />\ninstitution is required, as well as<br />\na genuine respect for the<br />\nuniqueness of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAs Co-Chairman of the 1991<br />\nSpring Fair, I feel that I have<br />\nalready begun to take an active<br />\nrole in improving student life. My<br />\ngoals for this year's Fair were to<br />\nprovide students with an even<br />\ngreater opportunity for involvement. Yet, I realized that the Fair<br />\nis not only for the students, but<br />\nalso for Baltimore. Consequently, Spring Fair will be increasing<br />\ntheir charitable donations. The<br />\ncombination of more student involvement and better awareness<br />\nof the Baltimore community can<br />\nonly help Johns Hopkins. Having<br />\nbeen a tour guide for over three<br />\nyears, I know all the different<br />\nfacets of Hopkins. Each tour that<br />\nI give increases my appreciation<br />\nfor the University and its<br />\nphilosophy. I feel that my<br />\nknowledge and respect for the<br />\nUniversity can add much to the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br />\nAs 1 prepare to graduate, I want<br />\nto begin my four years again.

As a Sophomore and<br />\nJunior Class Representative on<br />\nStudent Council, I began my<br />\ncommitment to improving the<br />\nquality of undergraduate life. By<br />\nworking first to strengthen my<br />\nclass, I gained insight into many<br />\nof the important issues involving<br />\nthe entire Homewood campus.<br />\nBesides working with other<br />\nstudents, my positions on Student<br />\nCouncil and the Homewood<br />\nSchools Services Advisory Committee have helped me to develop<br />\na better understanding of the administration's point of view.<br />\nFrom working to ensure adequate<br />\nhousing, to trying to promote<br />\nGreek life with the addition of a<br />\nthird sorority, I've always been<br />\ndedicated to the undergraduates.<br />\nAs a Young Trustee, I hope to<br />\ncontinue this commitment to<br />\nJohns Hopkins long after- I<br />\ngraduate.<br /><br />\nstudent from each division of the<br />\nUniversity. This committee<br />\ndiscusses problems that the<br />\nUniversity faces like health insurance for all students to child<br />\ncare for students who are also<br />\nparents.<br />\nAs the Young Trustee, I will<br />\nvoice my opinion for stronger<br />\nfund raising for a Student Union<br />\non the Homewood campus and<br />\nfor expansion of the Athletic<br />\nCenter. I will also support increasing efforts in recruiting<br />\nminority faculty, students, and<br />\nadministrators. I will not support<br />\nincreasing the number of<br />\nundergraduate students at<br />\nHomewood to help lower the<br />\ndeficit. These are issues that I<br />\nhave either supported or not supported as Student Council President, but as Young Trustee my<br />\nvoice will carry more weight. I<br />\nwill also make a strong effort to<br />\nkeep the lines of communication<br />\nopen between the undergraduates<br />\nand the Board of Trustees. I<br />\nwould appreciate your support.<br />\nJeffrey M.

A Young Trustee not only must be knowledgeable about<br />\nconcerns on Homewood Campus<br />\nbut also the issues that affect the<br />\nother divisions of the University.<br />\nAs the undergraduate representative on the Provost Search<br />\nCommittee, I worked with faculty<br />\nand administrators from all divisions and learned what problems<br />\nthe divisions face individually. A<br />\nYoung Trustee should also be experienced in working with the administration. As Student Council<br />\nPresident this past year, I met<br />\nwith Deans Armstrong and<br />\nVandeLinde almost monthly and<br />\nwith President Richardson<br />\nbimonthly.

Robinson, Jr.<br />\nMy desire to be involved in the<br />\nongoing activities of the University and my residence in the<br />\nBaltimore/Washington area are<br />\nthe reasons why I have decided<br />\nto seek the Young Trustee position. Though I recognize that the<br />\ntype of involvement will be<br />\nmarkedly different than that as an<br />\nundergraduate, a Young Trustee<br />\ncan only benefit from his/her experiences as a student. I would<br />\nlike to apply what I have learned<br />\nwhile working with students,<br />\nUniversity staff, and the community in attempting to represent<br />\nour perspective. This will be<br />\nfacilitated because I plan to live<br />\nnear Baltimore so I see this as a<br />\nwonderful opportunity to remain<br />\ninformed about issues affecting<br />\nJohns Hopkins\u2014particularly<br />\nthose related to undergraduates.<br />\nThis could also be a chance to<br />\ncommunicate with students about<br />\nthe role of the Trustees and their<br />\npolicies and help promote a better understanding between the<br />\ntwo. After four years at Hopkins,<br />\nI am prepared to depart, but I<br />\nwould look forward to serving as<br />\nthe next Young Trustee.<br />\nMatthew Randall Rosengart<br />\nAs current Secretary of Student<br />\nCouncil, I serve as the bridge between the faculty, higher adiiiiiiistration, council, and the student body. I seek to involve<br />\nmyself in the issues concerning<br />\nboth the University, present and<br />\nfuture, and the student body at<br />\nlarge. As diverse as my extracurriculars may appear, they possess<br />\none common thread; my efforts<br />\nlink the student body, Universi-<br /><br />\nty and community. As<br />\nHousemaster, I represent the<br />\nUniversity policies to freshmen;<br />\nhowever, in turn, I voice their<br />\nopinions and concerns to the administration. As an active<br />\nmember of the Alpha Tau Omega<br />\nfraternity, I am sensitive to the<br />\nneeds of the community as well.<br />\nWhile I represent the University<br />\nto the community, I also serve to<br />\nrelay the concerns of the community back to the school. As a<br />\nformer tutor for high school<br />\nstudents in the surrounding area,<br />\nI present a positive and exciting<br />\nperspective of the University and<br />\nthe success of its students. My<br />\namiability, gregarity, and genuine<br />\nconcern for the University as a<br />\nwhole, are qualities needed by a<br />\nYoung Trustee, and they are attributes I will continue to possess<br />\nas I maintain the link between the<br />\nUniversity, student body, and<br />\ncommunity in fulfilling the<br />\nposition.<br />\nJennifer D. Sharp<br />\nThis University is comprised of<br />\nmany parts, making it impossible<br />\nfor each person on the Board of<br />\nTrustees to know and understand<br />\nall aspects of the Hopkins community in order to make appropriate decisions for the<br />\nUniversity. Instead, each member<br />\nbrings his own knowledge and<br />\nexperience to the Board, so that<br />\ncollectively its members may<br />\nmake decisions which ensure that<br />\nour institution maintains its<br />\nrespected place within the<br />\nacademic community. It is the<br />\nYoung Trustees who provide the<br />\nRoard with insight to the thoughts<br />\nid feelings of the student<br />\npopulation, and who ensure the<br />\nundergraduates that their views<br />\nare expressed to and heard by the<br />\nBoard.<br />\nThe past three and a half years<br />\nof my undergraduate career have<br />\nprepared me well for the position<br />\nof Young Trustee. My academic<br /><br />\nbackground is engineering; I also<br />\nhave a strong humanities<br />\nbackground and have taken advantage of opportunities at<br />\nPeabody. More importantly, having been involved in athletics,<br />\nResidential Life, the Arts and<br />\nGreek life, I have worked extensively with students at all levels,<br />\nwhich has provided me the<br />\nknowledge and understanding of<br />\nstudent concerns. As a Young<br />\nTrustee, I will represent Hopkins<br />\nstudents and, if nothing else, help<br />\nothers on the Board of Trustees<br />\nto understand student views.<br />\nI would be naive to expect that<br />\nby serving as Young Trustee, I<br />\ncan change Hopkins and \"do<br />\ngreat things\" for the University.<br />\nI am only one person, but that<br />\ndoes not mean that I cannot make<br />\na difference.<br />\nMichele Lynn Wolf<br />\nThrough my undergraduate experiences at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, I believe I have<br />\ndeveloped some of the necessary<br />\nskills that would allow me to be<br />\nqualified for the position of<br />\nYoung Trustee. As an active<br />\nmember of this campus, I have<br />\nlearned how to work with<br />\nstudents, faculty and administrators, and I have become<br />\nknowledgeable about issues that<br />\nface us, the students, and the<br />\nUniversity as a whole.<br />\nAs Vice President of Student<br />\nCouncil this year and a member<br />\nfor the past three, I know about<br />\nthe issues concerning students,<br />\nand I have worked to try and<br />\nalleviate some of the problems we<br />\nhave faced. While as a Community Assistant, Student Advising<br />\nCo-Chair for Orientation '89, and<br />\nBlue Key Tour Guide, I have<br />\ngained a good understanding of<br />\nthe Hopkins community. I want<br />\nto work with the Board of<br />\nTrustees on the issues of faculty<br />\ncuts, class size, and tuition increases. I horie we can bring back<br /><br />\nAmerican<br />\nGreen<br />\nContinued from page 7<br />\neach dollar of GNP, Japan uses<br />\none half the amount of energy the<br />\nU.S. requires. This is the effect<br />\nof Japan's national energy<br />\nstrategy which emphasizes<br />\nenergy conservation and energy<br />\nefficiency. Since the oil shock of<br />\nthe early 1970s Japan has cut its<br />\noil use by 75 percent, and, at the<br />\nsame time, doubled its GNP. If<br />\nthe U.S. used oil as efficiently as<br />\nJapan, we would only use 40 percent of the oil we need now.<br />\nJapan has stressed its energy efficiency strategy on industry, but<br />\ntwo-thirds of American oil consumption is in the transportation<br />\nindustry. We are addicted to our<br />\ncars. The National Energy<br />\nStrategy, in planning for future<br />\ntransportation, includes a plan to<br />\nexpand the highway system,<br />\npossibly as much as doubling its<br />\nsize. There is no mention of mass<br />\ntransportation. Even limiting the<br />\ndiscussion to cars, the NES calls<br />\nfor no increase in Federal fuelefficiency standards. It demands<br />\nthe average mileage of the new<br />\ncar fleet be 27 mpg. This means<br />\nthat some new cars will get even<br />\nless than this. A sense of perspective: A new Geo and the new<br />\nHonda Civic get more than 50<br />\nmpg. These are mid-priced,<br /><br />\nmass- produced, production line<br />\ncars, not prototypes.<br />\nWeathering one's home is<br />\nanother way that energy can be<br />\nsaved easily. Yet, rebates from<br />\nutility companies for energy conservation are now treated as partially taxable income, instead of<br />\nbeing tax deductions as they once<br />\nwere. Rather than encouraging<br />\nconservation, this will actually<br />\ndiscourage it. Pacific Gas and<br />\nElectric, the larges U.S. utility,<br />\nwill meet all increasing demand<br />\nover the next ten years completely with energy efficiency<br />\nprograms. Baltimore Gas and<br />\nElectric, so that it won't have to<br />\nbuild a new power plant, gives<br />\naway free weatherization kits.<br />\nThe National Energy Strategy, on<br />\nthe other hand, cuts the<br />\nWeatherization Assistance Program and the Low Income<br />\nHeating Energy Assistance Program, two programs helping poor<br />\npeople save energy and money.<br />\nThe Weatherization Assistance<br />\nProgram, which was cut completely, used to cost $200 million.<br />\nThe Low Income Heating Energy<br />\nAssistance Program was cut from<br />\n$1610 million to $1025 million.<br />\nThese numbers seem large, but<br />\nour government is happy to spend<br />\n$500 million on one stealth<br /><br />\nthe word \"seminar class\" and<br />\nhave it mean that less than twenty students are enrolled in the<br />\nclass. I believe we should continue to evaluate how the Five<br />\nYear Plan is affecting<br />\nundergraduates, and try to ensure<br />\nthat it does not happen again.<br />\nHopkins has been a very important part of my life, and I hope<br />\nto continue my involvement as a<br />\nYoung Trustee.<br /><br />\ndedicated much of my spare time<br />\nto improving the quality of life for<br />\nthe students at Homewood. As<br />\nthe president of my class, I have<br />\nhad the opportunity to make<br />\ntangible and universal improvements for the student body<br />\nwith last year's gains through the<br />\nbookstore committee, gaining approval for the creation of a<br />\nstudent-run radio station, authoring the Neighborhood Watch proposal, and, with President<br />\nRichardson's help, initiating the<br />\ncampaign to make the Death Lane<br />\nsafer for the students of this<br /><br />\nArthur R. Yoon<br />\nIn my years at Hopkins, I have<br /><br />\nbomber.<br />\nBush's National Energy<br />\nStrategy is not a strategy for the<br />\nfuture. It is the same tired policies<br />\nthat have gotten us into the mess<br />\nwe are in today. America is only<br />\n5 percent of the world's population, but we use 30 percent of the<br />\nworld's energy. Our \"environmental\"<br />\npresident's<br />\n\"energy strategy\" that took so<br />\nlong to write doesn't even consider energy conservation.

Oh, and<br />\nKathy, you're the best.<br /><br />\nupwardly-mobile path from wedding/obituary writers to the most<br />\npopular editorial pair in<br />\nBaltimore. They are so popular,<br />\nin fact, that their faces make it onto the side of an MTA bus\u2014big<br />\nstuff in this city. Their new-found<br />\nfame relies on their insistent opposition, and similarly, the fun of<br />\nthis movie depends on the<br />\ndiscrepancies between their two<br />\naccounts of the romance\u2014from<br />\nits start to its almost-finish. For<br />\nthose of you who have yet to get<br />\nit, what He Said is not what She<br />\nSaid.<br />\nThe movie does play on a<br />\ndisheartening amount of malefemale stereotyping. We first see<br />\nDan as the swinging playboy<br />\nbachelor; he juggles women on<br />\nthe staff of the paper until Lone<br />\nmanages to snare his attention<br />\naway. Dan harbors a more<br />\nserious romantic interest in the<br />\ncharacter of Linda (played by<br />\nSharon Stone\u2014women will hate<br />\nher because of her agonizing<br />\nbeauty), who we find has just<br />\nreturned from Paris. Linda's a<br />\nfashion designer, which makes<br />\nyou ask what she is doing in<br />\nBaltimore. That issue aside, she<br />\nremains a threat throughout the<br />\nmovie.<br />\nThe conflict in the romance<br />\nrests on the question of commitment: Lone wants it, Dan<br />\ndoesn't. A four-star moment in<br />\nthe film occurs during the \"He<br />\nSaid\" rendition of the first date,<br />\nwhich takes place at an Italian<br />\nrestaurant.(One detail of the relationship that they both agree on.)<br />\nIn a daydream sequence, Dan<br />\nlooks over the menu and, to his<br />\nhorror, discovers the only things<br />\non it are monogamy, commit-<br /><br />\nment, marriage, and children.<br />\nPanicked, he asks the waiter,<br />\n\"Can't I just get a side order of<br />\nsex?\"<br />\nThe conflict between commitment and freedom is one that may<br />\npervade the \"modern relationship,\" but in this movie one<br />\nyearns for a change from its usual<br />\ndepiction. For example, why<br />\ncouldn't Lone be asking for the<br />\n\"side order of sex\" while Dan<br />\nbegs at her feet for a wedding,<br />\nchildren, and The Big White<br />\nHouse? And why is it Dan whose<br />\nfidelity is in question? One<br />\ndesperately wishes that this Dan<br />\nperson be replaced by the likes of<br />\nMel Gibson. Audiences would<br />\ndefinitely be less inundated with<br />\nthe Bacon smirk.<br />\nAlthough He Said, She Said<br />\ndoes make use of popular<br />\nstereotypes which are somewhat<br />\npredictable and disappointing, the<br />\nfilm as a whole provides quality<br />\nentertainment. There's a small<br />\ncerebral<br />\nin<br />\nchallenge<br />\ndistinguishing the differences between the two characters' renditions of the relationship, and it's<br />\nfun when obscured messages<br />\nfrom the first part of the film<br />\nreveal themselves in the<br />\nsecond\u2014the \"highway merger,\"<br />\nfor example.(Major symbolism,<br />\nfigure it out.y What the film<br />\nleaves you with is an optimistic<br />\nfeeling about the state of affairs<br />\nbetween the sexes, and who<br />\ndoesn't need that every once in<br />\na while?

The<br />\nBBQ chicken platter was much<br />\ndrier than the sandwich and<br />\nnothing special. The turkey sand-<br /><br />\nwich was also very dry and rather<br />\ntasteless.

School here in Maryland.<br />\nFollowing the opening of John<br />\nCarol!, Father Riepe attended<br />\nworking sessions of the Vatican<br />\nCouncil II in Rome.<br />\nIn the community he has served as Rector of the Cathedral of<br />\nMary Our Queen on Charles<br />\nStreet. Most recently he was Rec-<br /><br />\ntor and Headmaster of St. Sebastian's Country Day School. He<br />\ntaught a course on liturgy at St.<br />\nMary's Seminary and the University of Baltimore. He currently<br />\nserves as chaplain of the<br />\nBaltimore County Police.<br />\nFather Riepe has also been active in several publications, including The Mass of the Roman<br />\nRite, The People 's Mass Book,<br />\nand Living the Christian Seasons.<br />\nHe has also contributed articles<br />\nto Worship and The Catholic<br />\nReview.<br />\nConcern for the community<br />\nalso motivated Father Riepe to<br />\nconduct rehabilitation programs<br />\nfor drug offenders in Harford<br />\nCounty. He presided over Mann<br />\nHouse, Inc., a halfway house for<br />\nalcoholics in Bel Air, and was<br />\nresponsible for its purchase by the<br />\ncounty. It is no wonder, then, that<br />\nin 1976, Father Riepe was named Harford County's \"Man of the<br />\nYear\" by The Aegis newspaper.<br />\nBack on campus, Father Riepe<br />\nhas conducted Catholic mass<br />\nevery Sunday since September, at<br />\n11 A.M. in the Glass Pavilion.<br /><br />\nHe also heads the Catholic Community's weekly \"Newman<br />\nNight.\" Every Tuesday evening<br />\nat the Newman House on 2941<br />\nNorth Charles Street starts with<br />\na student-served dinner at 6 P.M.<br />\nDiscussion follows at 7 P.M.

Alas, the<br />\ndesserts aren't nearly as yummy as<br />\nthey sound. For starters,<br />\nTamber's only has four flavors of<br />\nice cream: vanilla, chocolate,<br />\nstrawberry, and coffee. The malt<br />\nwas like sucking soft ice cream<br />\nthrough a straw. Strawberry topping is closer to preserves than a<br />\nsauce. And the hot fudge is cold<br />\nand obnoxiously sweet.<br />\nThe service, like the ice cream,<br />\nwas disappointing. Orders (particularly ice cream) were often<br />\nscrewed up.
