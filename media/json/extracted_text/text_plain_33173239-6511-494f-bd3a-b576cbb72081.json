Walking<br />\n'around Homewood, you find a lot of people nodding to<br />\nacquaintances but really talking to few. There's a<br />\nreason: most undergraduates know very few.<br />\nFreshman year friends and friends of freshman year<br />\nfriends. Then the array of special interest groups from<br />\nwhich many feel forced to choose. Join a fraternity, join<br />\nan organization, become a student politico, a student<br />\njournalist...a student radical. Join or not, many become<br />\ncircumscribed more tightly as each year progresses.<br />\nHopkins is in more than a financial crisis. It is in a<br />\ncrisis of community,and it has suffered a long time. The<br />\nterm \"University community\" is brandished much too<br />\nthoughtlessly much too often. A community exists as a<br />\ncommunity if its members live in close proximity and<br />\ncome into contact playing more roles than one. It is<br />\nbased on sharing. The student ghetto doesn't qualify;<br />\ndormitories do.<br />\nDormitory living acts as a supplement to classroom<br />\neducation in the learning process. It certainly shouldn't<br />\nbe made mandatory for all four years, but the facilities<br />\nmust be made more appealing than they are at present.<br />\nAnd half of the problem is lack of desirable space.<br />\nIn that context, the University's decision to purchase<br />\nthe Homewood Apartments on Charles and 31st can only<br />\nbe lauded. Three years ago, however, Hopkins missed a<br />\nchance to buy one of the towering luxury apartment<br />\nhouses on University Parkway at a bargain basement<br />\nrate. The builder had gone bankrupt in midconstruction.<br />\nMore than a student union, and certainly more than an<br />\nadministration building, what Hopkins needs is housing.<br />\nIt's good to see that those who have the say are finally<br />\ngetting some vision.<br />\n<br />\nGrades: Time For<br />\nA Second Look<br />\nFreshmen have enough to worry about during their<br />\nfirst semester adjusting to college life without the<br />\nburden of grades. And yet, in a system where much of<br />\ntheir future is going to depend on those grades, it would<br />\nbe foolish to deprive them of the right to know where<br />\nthey stand.<br />\nWe agree with the Academic Council's decision to<br />\nexclude first semester freshman grades from official<br />\ntranscripts, still transmitting grades to students.<br />\nThe Council checked out the situation with graduate<br />\nand professional schools and found that those grades<br />\nhave little or no bearing on admissions. So it wisely<br />\nacted to remove unnecessary pressures, stating they<br />\nare \"at a level which is detrimental to learning.\"<br />\nThe next step should be to reexamine the entire<br />\nconcept of grading at Hopkins, a task virtually ignored<br />\nby the current Committee on Undergraduate Studies. It<br />\nshould certainly be one of the first matters taken up by<br />\nthe new Blue Ribbon panel.<br />\nHopkins once was a pass-fail school in the days before<br />\npass-fail became fashionable at \"Progressive\" institutions. It is certainly time for a second look.<br />\n<br />\nSalary or Tenure Cuts?<br />\nBy NORMAN HENLEY<br />\nThe possibility of an overall cut in faculty'<br />\nsalaries on a temporary emergency basis<br />\nhas been ruled out by administrative fiat.<br />\nInstead, terminal notice will be given to as<br />\nmany of the nontenured faculty as will seem<br />\nnecessary, the present anticipation being<br />\nthat the number may be substantial.<br />\nCertainly, an overall cut in faculty salaries<br />\nis not a simple matter, and allowance for<br />\nsome factors would have to be made. For<br />\nexample, in view of pension rules, it would<br />\nbe a serious injustice to cut the salaries of<br />\nthose near retirement. Nor is it fair to<br />\nassume that the faculty, given the opportunity, would or ought to approve an<br />\noverall cut in faculty salaries. Neverthe less,<br />\nit does seem to me that the faculty should<br />\nhave the right to consider this important<br />\nmatter if it so desires and with the assurance<br />\nthat its feelings will have some meaning.<br />\nIf we may think briefly in a broader<br />\nperspective, it is easy to imagine the<br />\npotential disaster to our nation's higher<br />\neducational system if all our colleges and<br />\nuniversities adopt Hopkins' policy of<br />\nmaintaining \"excellence\" by reducing the<br />\nsize of the faculty in order to sustain an<br />\noptimum salary level. Many capable young<br />\nmen and women already well-trained may<br />\nbe forced to leave the field of education<br />\npermanently, to everybody's loss.<br />\nBut what is \"excellence\" at Hopkins? I<br />\nimagine there would be general agreement<br />\nwithin the faculty and administration that<br />\n\"excellence\" resides in the tenured faculty<br />\n<br />\nactually and in the nontenured faculty<br />\npotentially; at least, that would be a more or<br />\nless official statement of the ideal. Ideally<br />\nthe tenured faculty has already proven itself<br />\nby having engaged successfully in the proper<br />\namount of research and publication as<br />\njudged by those judged worthy to judge. This<br />\nsounds great, and it is great,so far as it goes.<br />\nAll the same, there are other things to think<br />\nabout these days, one of them being<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe attitude that \"excellence\" is<br />\nsynonymous with high-quality research and<br />\npublication could be justified at Hopkins.<br />\nwere the University to make up its mind to<br />\ndeclare itself a research institution (which<br />\ncould include a certain type of undergraduate) and if it were to give up all<br />\npublic pretense of offering a liberal arts<br />\neducation to undergraduates. Many of us<br />\nwould find that saddening, but at least it<br />\nwould be honest.<br />\nHowever, if Hopkins wants to be an<br />\neducational institution, then the faculty<br />\nshould consider any and all possibilities in<br />\nthis grievous situation. For conceivably the<br />\nenvisaged reduction of the faculty could<br />\nwreck Hopkins as an educational institution.<br />\nIf Hopkins wishes to measure up to its<br />\neducational responsibilities, then, in my<br />\nview, the very last resort will be the<br />\nelimination of capable junior faculty now<br />\nemployed in the regular instructional<br />\nprogram.<br />\nDr. Norman Henley is a lecturer in Russian.<br />\n<br />\nWhoosh! Click. Brrrrrr...<br />\n<br />\nThe Bowels of Homewood<br />\nBy DON CAMPOLO<br />\nWhat is it?--A sculpture?--A<br />\nmemorial of some sort? Who<br />\nput it there?<br />\nStanding in the quad at the<br />\nopposite end from Shriver<br />\nHall, it looks harmless<br />\nenough, if not meaningless.<br />\nIt's just an innocent hunk of<br />\nhollow, dull-grey metal about<br />\nseven feet tall and that's<br />\nit...or so it seems.<br />\nthe<br />\nexamining<br />\nUpon<br />\nstructure one dark night, I<br />\nremarkable<br />\na<br />\nmake<br />\ndiscovery. My hand happens<br />\nto slide over a bump in the<br />\nmonument's metal skin and<br />\nthe entire thing, along with its<br />\nconcrete base, rumbles over<br />\nto one side revealing the<br />\nentrance to an underground<br />\npassage. There's room<br />\nenough for an average-sized<br />\nperson. A wooden ladder<br />\ndescends into a damp tunnel<br />\nsparsely lit by bare incandescent bulbs hanging<br />\nfrom the ceiling.<br />\nI climb into the entrance<br />\nand down the ladder, and<br />\nlooking up notice that the<br />\nmetal thing isn't hollow but is<br />\nfilled with strange and<br />\ncomplex machinery.<br />\n'Fighting my Hopkinsconditioned directive for noninvolvement and leaving well<br />\nenough alone I push the<br />\nbutton at the bottom of the<br />\nladder which closes up the<br />\nentrance. I proceed along the<br />\ntunnel, sensing that I'm<br />\nheaded northeast. After a<br />\ncouple of hundred yards a<br />\n<br />\nsmall square of light glows<br />\nbefore me. It's a door leading<br />\ninto a brightly lit room.<br />\nPeeking cautiously through<br />\nthe glass, I see that the room<br />\nis a small one, recognized as<br />\none of those on D-Level of the<br />\nM.S.E.

Stills seems to go<br />\nin for variety, playing bluesy<br />\nriffs, wah wah riffs, and<br />\nfinger-picking riffs back-toback on both sides of the<br />\nalbum.<br />\nIn addition to Stills, the<br />\nrecord features single cuts<br />\nWith Clapton, Hendrix,<br />\nBooker T. Jones, and vocals<br />\nwith John Sebastian, Cass<br />\nCrosby,<br />\nDavid<br />\nElliot,<br />\nGraham Nash, and Rita<br />\nCoolidge. Hendrix's guitar is<br />\neclipsed by Stills' organ,<br />\nwhich got remixed in too loud,<br />\nbut Clapton takes a back seat<br />\nto nobody, and plays the usual<br />\nblistering Eric Clapton lead<br />\nthat makes you more or less<br />\ncompletely forget Stills.<br />\n<br />\nThe outstanding cut is \"Go<br />\nBack Home,\" partly because<br />\nof Stills, and partly because<br />\nof Eric Clapton. The other<br />\nreally noteworthy cut is<br />\n\"Black Queen.\" The liner<br />\nnote reads: \"Was recorded<br />\nlive and the performance is<br />\ncourtesy of Jose Cuervo Gold<br />\nLabel Tequila.\" And he must<br />\nhave done up quite a bit.<br />\nLayla and Other Assorted Love<br />\nSongs, by Derek and the Dominoes/Atlantic SD2-704<br />\n\u2022<br />\nEric Clapton must certainly be one of the most<br />\nprolific musicians\u00b0 in the<br />\nbusiness. In the past Rine<br />\nmonths, he has put out four<br />\nrecords with three different<br />\ngroups: first, the Delaney &<br />\nBonnie record, then the Eric<br />\nClapton record, and now the<br />\nDerek and the Dominos<br />\ndouble album.<br />\nGettin Better Every Day<br />\nAnd he keeps getting<br />\nbetter.

He eschews<br />\npainfully loud volumes, fuzzy<br />\ndistortion, and gimmickry in<br />\ngeneral. When he does use<br />\nthings like a wahwah, he does<br />\nit sparingly.<br />\nClapton is the star of the<br />\nrecord, no doubt about that.<br />\nBut the other musicians are<br />\npretty good, too; especially<br />\nDuane Allman, who plays<br />\nslide guitar opposite Clapton.<br />\nThere aren't many slide<br />\nguitarists around who can<br />\nrival Allman, but then there<br />\naren't many slide guitarists,<br />\nso I don't know. He seems<br />\nremarkably adept at playing<br />\na \"second lead\" which<br />\ncomplements Clapton's leads<br />\nwithout interfering.<br />\nThere is an organistpianist-singer named Bobby<br />\nWhitlock who collaborated on<br />\nwriting a lot of the songs. I<br />\ndon't know where Clapton<br />\ndug him up, but he is damn<br />\ngood, as is the bass player,<br />\nCarl Radle.<br />\n<br />\nClyde and friend<br />\n<br />\ndependent on one such star's<br />\nefforts, their style of play<br />\ndesigned to exploit his<br />\ntalents; witness last year's<br />\nMilwaukee Bucks and their<br />\ndominance by Alcindor.<br />\nOthers, such as the<br />\nBaltimore Bullets, go with<br />\nfive such stars, throwing<br />\neverything up in the air and<br />\nhoping that the whole will<br />\nbalance out.

When there is a small demand, there is a small supply. Take, for example, knee-cymbals. You<br />\nwalk into your average American middle-sized town today and I'll<br />\nwager you won't see more than eighty or ninety knee-cymbal vendors.<br />\nThat's because the demand is small.<br />\nWith Miller High Life Beer, on the other hand, you'll see a great<br />\nsupply because there is a great demand. And of course the demand is<br />\ngreat because the beer is great. And, mark you, I'm not asking you to<br />\ntake my word for it. Prove it yourself with this simple test:<br />\nGet a can or bottle of Miller High Life and pour a few ounces into<br />\nan empty vessel\u2014your roommate, for example. Observe how his jaw<br />\nunslacks with pleasure, how the torpidity leaves his tiny eyes, how he<br />\ndrops his yb-yo and whimpers for more. Could mere words tell you<br />\none-quarter as well what a great beer Miller is? Of course not.<br />\n\"Great,\" in fact, is the single adjective that describes Miller Beer<br />\nbest (except possibly \"wet\"). Indeed some people are so overcome with<br />\nadmiration for Miller's greatness that they can't bear to drink it. They<br />\njust sit with a glass of Miller in hand and admire it for as long as ten or<br />\ntwelve years on end. The makers of Miller Beer are of course touched<br />\nby this reverence, except of course for Clyde R. Greedy, the sales<br />\nmanager.<br />\nBut I digress. Adam Smith, as you know of course, was followed<br />\nby David Ricardo. In fact, he was followed everywhere by Mr. Ricardo.<br />\nHe finally got so annoyed that he summoned a booby, as British<br />\npolicemen are called, and had Mr. Ricardo arrested. (This later became known as the Humboldt Current.)<br />\nUpon his release from gaol, as British jails are called, Mr. Ricardo<br />\nmarried Thomas Robert Malthus and one night over a game of whist<br />\nthey invented the stock exchange, or chutney as it is called in England.<br />\nNext, economics spread to France (carried, some say, by sheep<br />\nticks). The French, however, never really got the hang of it. At first<br />\nthey tried using omelettes as the medium of exchange. When this<br />\nfailed, they tried Edith Piaf records. When this too failed, they flew<br />\ninto a fit of pique and dug the Suez Canal.<br />\nWell sir, I guess you know what happened next. Economics came<br />\nto America, John Kenneth Galbraith fought his famous duel with<br />\nAaron Burr, Gresham's Law was repealed, and at last came the happy<br />\nending.

Walking<br />\n'around Homewood, you find a lot of people nodding to<br />\nacquaintances but really talking to few. There's a<br />\nreason: most undergraduates know very few.<br />\nFreshman year friends and friends of freshman year<br />\nfriends. Then the array of special interest groups from<br />\nwhich many feel forced to choose. Join a fraternity, join<br />\nan organization, become a student politico, a student<br />\njournalist...a student radical. Join or not, many become<br />\ncircumscribed more tightly as each year progresses.<br />\nHopkins is in more than a financial crisis. It is in a<br />\ncrisis of community,and it has suffered a long time. The<br />\nterm \"University community\" is brandished much too<br />\nthoughtlessly much too often. A community exists as a<br />\ncommunity if its members live in close proximity and<br />\ncome into contact playing more roles than one. It is<br />\nbased on sharing. The student ghetto doesn't qualify;<br />\ndormitories do.<br />\nDormitory living acts as a supplement to classroom<br />\neducation in the learning process. It certainly shouldn't<br />\nbe made mandatory for all four years, but the facilities<br />\nmust be made more appealing than they are at present.<br />\nAnd half of the problem is lack of desirable space.<br />\nIn that context, the University's decision to purchase<br />\nthe Homewood Apartments on Charles and 31st can only<br />\nbe lauded. Three years ago, however, Hopkins missed a<br />\nchance to buy one of the towering luxury apartment<br />\nhouses on University Parkway at a bargain basement<br />\nrate. The builder had gone bankrupt in midconstruction.<br />\nMore than a student union, and certainly more than an<br />\nadministration building, what Hopkins needs is housing.<br />\nIt's good to see that those who have the say are finally<br />\ngetting some vision.<br /><br />\nGrades: Time For<br />\nA Second Look<br />\nFreshmen have enough to worry about during their<br />\nfirst semester adjusting to college life without the<br />\nburden of grades. And yet, in a system where much of<br />\ntheir future is going to depend on those grades, it would<br />\nbe foolish to deprive them of the right to know where<br />\nthey stand.<br />\nWe agree with the Academic Council's decision to<br />\nexclude first semester freshman grades from official<br />\ntranscripts, still transmitting grades to students.<br />\nThe Council checked out the situation with graduate<br />\nand professional schools and found that those grades<br />\nhave little or no bearing on admissions. So it wisely<br />\nacted to remove unnecessary pressures, stating they<br />\nare \"at a level which is detrimental to learning.\"<br />\nThe next step should be to reexamine the entire<br />\nconcept of grading at Hopkins, a task virtually ignored<br />\nby the current Committee on Undergraduate Studies. It<br />\nshould certainly be one of the first matters taken up by<br />\nthe new Blue Ribbon panel.<br />\nHopkins once was a pass-fail school in the days before<br />\npass-fail became fashionable at \"Progressive\" institutions. It is certainly time for a second look.<br /><br />\nSalary or Tenure Cuts?<br />\nBy NORMAN HENLEY<br />\nThe possibility of an overall cut in faculty'<br />\nsalaries on a temporary emergency basis<br />\nhas been ruled out by administrative fiat.<br />\nInstead, terminal notice will be given to as<br />\nmany of the nontenured faculty as will seem<br />\nnecessary, the present anticipation being<br />\nthat the number may be substantial.<br />\nCertainly, an overall cut in faculty salaries<br />\nis not a simple matter, and allowance for<br />\nsome factors would have to be made. For<br />\nexample, in view of pension rules, it would<br />\nbe a serious injustice to cut the salaries of<br />\nthose near retirement. Nor is it fair to<br />\nassume that the faculty, given the opportunity, would or ought to approve an<br />\noverall cut in faculty salaries. Neverthe less,<br />\nit does seem to me that the faculty should<br />\nhave the right to consider this important<br />\nmatter if it so desires and with the assurance<br />\nthat its feelings will have some meaning.<br />\nIf we may think briefly in a broader<br />\nperspective, it is easy to imagine the<br />\npotential disaster to our nation's higher<br />\neducational system if all our colleges and<br />\nuniversities adopt Hopkins' policy of<br />\nmaintaining \"excellence\" by reducing the<br />\nsize of the faculty in order to sustain an<br />\noptimum salary level. Many capable young<br />\nmen and women already well-trained may<br />\nbe forced to leave the field of education<br />\npermanently, to everybody's loss.<br />\nBut what is \"excellence\" at Hopkins? I<br />\nimagine there would be general agreement<br />\nwithin the faculty and administration that<br />\n\"excellence\" resides in the tenured faculty<br /><br />\nactually and in the nontenured faculty<br />\npotentially; at least, that would be a more or<br />\nless official statement of the ideal. Ideally<br />\nthe tenured faculty has already proven itself<br />\nby having engaged successfully in the proper<br />\namount of research and publication as<br />\njudged by those judged worthy to judge. This<br />\nsounds great, and it is great,so far as it goes.<br />\nAll the same, there are other things to think<br />\nabout these days, one of them being<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe attitude that \"excellence\" is<br />\nsynonymous with high-quality research and<br />\npublication could be justified at Hopkins.<br />\nwere the University to make up its mind to<br />\ndeclare itself a research institution (which<br />\ncould include a certain type of undergraduate) and if it were to give up all<br />\npublic pretense of offering a liberal arts<br />\neducation to undergraduates. Many of us<br />\nwould find that saddening, but at least it<br />\nwould be honest.<br />\nHowever, if Hopkins wants to be an<br />\neducational institution, then the faculty<br />\nshould consider any and all possibilities in<br />\nthis grievous situation. For conceivably the<br />\nenvisaged reduction of the faculty could<br />\nwreck Hopkins as an educational institution.<br />\nIf Hopkins wishes to measure up to its<br />\neducational responsibilities, then, in my<br />\nview, the very last resort will be the<br />\nelimination of capable junior faculty now<br />\nemployed in the regular instructional<br />\nprogram.<br />\nDr. Norman Henley is a lecturer in Russian.<br /><br />\nWhoosh!

There's room<br />\nenough for an average-sized<br />\nperson.

Stills seems to go<br />\nin for variety, playing bluesy<br />\nriffs, wah wah riffs, and<br />\nfinger-picking riffs back-toback on both sides of the<br />\nalbum.<br />\nIn addition to Stills, the<br />\nrecord features single cuts<br />\nWith Clapton, Hendrix,<br />\nBooker T. Jones, and vocals<br />\nwith John Sebastian, Cass<br />\nCrosby,<br />\nDavid<br />\nElliot,<br />\nGraham Nash, and Rita<br />\nCoolidge. Hendrix's guitar is<br />\neclipsed by Stills' organ,<br />\nwhich got remixed in too loud,<br />\nbut Clapton takes a back seat<br />\nto nobody, and plays the usual<br />\nblistering Eric Clapton lead<br />\nthat makes you more or less<br />\ncompletely forget Stills.<br /><br />\nThe outstanding cut is \"Go<br />\nBack Home,\" partly because<br />\nof Stills, and partly because<br />\nof Eric Clapton. The other<br />\nreally noteworthy cut is<br />\n\"Black Queen.\" The liner<br />\nnote reads: \"Was recorded<br />\nlive and the performance is<br />\ncourtesy of Jose Cuervo Gold<br />\nLabel Tequila.\" And he must<br />\nhave done up quite a bit.<br />\nLayla and Other Assorted Love<br />\nSongs, by Derek and the Dominoes/Atlantic SD2-704<br />\n\u2022<br />\nEric Clapton must certainly be one of the most<br />\nprolific musicians\u00b0 in the<br />\nbusiness. In the past Rine<br />\nmonths, he has put out four<br />\nrecords with three different<br />\ngroups: first, the Delaney &amp;<br />\nBonnie record, then the Eric<br />\nClapton record, and now the<br />\nDerek and the Dominos<br />\ndouble album.<br />\nGettin Better Every Day<br />\nAnd he keeps getting<br />\nbetter.

He eschews<br />\npainfully loud volumes, fuzzy<br />\ndistortion, and gimmickry in<br />\ngeneral. When he does use<br />\nthings like a wahwah, he does<br />\nit sparingly.<br />\nClapton is the star of the<br />\nrecord, no doubt about that.<br />\nBut the other musicians are<br />\npretty good, too; especially<br />\nDuane Allman, who plays<br />\nslide guitar opposite Clapton.<br />\nThere aren't many slide<br />\nguitarists around who can<br />\nrival Allman, but then there<br />\naren't many slide guitarists,<br />\nso I don't know. He seems<br />\nremarkably adept at playing<br />\na \"second lead\" which<br />\ncomplements Clapton's leads<br />\nwithout interfering.<br />\nThere is an organistpianist-singer named Bobby<br />\nWhitlock who collaborated on<br />\nwriting a lot of the songs. I<br />\ndon't know where Clapton<br />\ndug him up, but he is damn<br />\ngood, as is the bass player,<br />\nCarl Radle.<br /><br />\nClyde and friend<br /><br />\ndependent on one such star's<br />\nefforts, their style of play<br />\ndesigned to exploit his<br />\ntalents; witness last year's<br />\nMilwaukee Bucks and their<br />\ndominance by Alcindor.<br />\nOthers, such as the<br />\nBaltimore Bullets, go with<br />\nfive such stars, throwing<br />\neverything up in the air and<br />\nhoping that the whole will<br />\nbalance out.

When there is a small demand, there is a small supply. Take, for example, knee-cymbals.

And of course the demand is<br />\ngreat because the beer is great. And, mark you, I'm not asking you to<br />\ntake my word for it.

In fact, he was followed everywhere by Mr. Ricardo.<br />\nHe finally got so annoyed that he summoned a booby, as British<br />\npolicemen are called, and had Mr. Ricardo arrested. (This later became known as the Humboldt Current.)<br />\nUpon his release from gaol, as British jails are called, Mr. Ricardo<br />\nmarried Thomas Robert Malthus and one night over a game of whist<br />\nthey invented the stock exchange, or chutney as it is called in England.<br />\nNext, economics spread to France (carried, some say, by sheep<br />\nticks). The French, however, never really got the hang of it. At first<br />\nthey tried using omelettes as the medium of exchange. When this<br />\nfailed, they tried Edith Piaf records. When this too failed, they flew<br />\ninto a fit of pique and dug the Suez Canal.<br />\nWell sir, I guess you know what happened next. Economics came<br />\nto America, John Kenneth Galbraith fought his famous duel with<br />\nAaron Burr, Gresham's Law was repealed, and at last came the happy<br />\nending.
