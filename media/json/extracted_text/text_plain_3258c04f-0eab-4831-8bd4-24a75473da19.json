The SAC also set up a subcommittee to consider what<br />\nshould be included in such a<br />\ncenter.<br />\nVice-President William Bevan<br />\nwas asked to appoint an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to study priorities for a<br />\nstudent Union by Gordon, despite<br />\nthe SAC's sub-committee. Both<br />\nbodies are presently studying what<br />\nis needed in a student union and<br />\nif a temporary center is available<br />\nwhile a permanent one is being<br />\nconstructed.<br />\n<br />\nRichard Cramer<br />\n<br />\nhoffmann<br />\n<br />\nSeveral members of the SAC<br />\nhave expressed concern that the<br />\nad hoc 'administration committee<br />\nwas designed to pre-empt the subcommittee. The sub-committee<br />\nmet for the first time this week to<br />\ndiscuss both permanent and interim plans for a student facility.<br />\nThe SAC's January resolution<br />\nsuggested that Shriver Hall be used<br />\nto house student activity officies<br />\nand other social and recreational<br />\nfacilities \u2022after the completion of<br />\nthe new administration building.<br />\nAt that time the admissions, registrar and public relations offices<br />\nwill be moved out of Shriver to<br />\nthe new building.<br />\nOne member of the administration said that .the building has<br />\ntentatively been promised to The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University Press.<br />\nHe also noted that the promise<br />\nwas not a firm one but that the<br />\n<br />\nWilliam Bevan<br />\n<br />\nhoffmann<br />\n<br />\nJohn McElwee<br />\n<br />\nChester Wickwire<br />\nPress was in dire need of the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nAt its first meeting last week,<br />\nthe, ad hoc committee discussed<br />\nwhat should be included in a<br />\ntemporary student center. Richard<br />\nCramer, an undergraduate member of the administration appointed committee, feared that the<br />\nbody will neglect to consider long<br />\nterm needs of the student body<br />\nwhile designing a temporary facility.<br />\nCramer also expressed concern<br />\nthat the special needs of Hopkins<br />\nstudents will be overlooked in the<br />\nplanning because the committee is<br />\nusing examples from other colleges<br />\nto build its own center. He claimed<br />\nthat \"individual rather than group<br />\nactivities should be stressed\" in the<br />\nplanning due to the solitary<br />\norientation of the student body.<br />\n<br />\n>\u2022<br />\nlemm<br />\n<br />\nThe ad hoc committee, chaired<br />\nby John McElwee, Director of<br />\nPlant Planning, began its work by<br />\nsetting priorities for an interim<br />\ncenter to be possibly housed in<br />\nShriver Hall. They did not discuss<br />\nany long range plans.for planning a<br />\npermanent student union. Other<br />\nmembers of the committee include<br />\nDean Carl Swanson, Dr. Chester<br />\nWickwire and grad student Donna<br />\nWilson.<br />\nThere are several reasons why<br />\nShriver Hall may not be a possible<br />\nchoice for an interim facility besides the promise to the Hopkins<br />\nPress. It is a general university<br />\nbuilding that is not designated to<br />\nbe used for solely Homewood<br />\nactivities.<br />\nShriver also may not be large<br />\nenough to house all the'activities<br />\nthat should be included in a stu-,<br />\ndent center, according to Dr..<br />\nBevan.

He stated that he<br />\nand the Arab people \"believe that we<br />\nhave in common with young Jews and<br />\nold Jews common ideas and common<br />\nconcerns.\"<br />\n\"We don't regard the conflict that<br />\ntook place in the Middle East and that<br />\ncontinues, unfortunately in an intensified form, as a conflict between Arabs<br />\nand Jews,\" he commented.<br />\nEmphasizing that the Jews are a religious, not a political entity, Sharaf<br />\nsaid that the Arabs' quarrel was with<br />\nZionism. He claimed that the conflict<br />\nbetween \"the Arabs, who lived in that<br />\nPart of the world for many, many cen-<br />\n<br />\nturies, and what from our point of view<br />\nis and invading, colonial, militarist movement, based on exclusiveness.\"<br />\n<br />\nReligious Exclusiveness<br />\nSharaf made the point several times<br />\nthat in Israel, \"religious as well as<br />\nracial\" exclusiveness was an institution. Anti-semitism in Arab countries,<br />\nhe said, is only a reaction to Israeli<br />\nintolerance and is not institutionalized.<br />\nHe also suggested that this Zionist exclusiveness was \"not only not identical<br />\nwith Judaism, but the very antithesis<br />\nof Judaism.\"<br />\nThe Ambassador claimed that the<br />\nformation of Israel was a reaction to<br />\nWestern persecution of the Jews. What<br />\nshould have been created, said Sharaf,<br />\nwas an atmosphere of religious tolerance in the Western world. He implied that the Arab nations were bearing the brunt of Western guilt even<br />\nthough they had nothing to do with the<br />\n<br />\nJordanian Ambassador Abdul Amid Sharaf: \"The West at one point wanted to relieve its own<br />\n_guilt by giving Israel a carte blanche to do whatever it wanted.plc by hoffmann<br />\n<br />\npersecution of the Jews. \"The West<br />\nat one point wanted to relieve its own<br />\nguilt by giving Israel a carte blanche to<br />\ndo whatever it wanted,\" he commented.<br />\nAttacking the idea that Israel is a<br />\nsmall beleagured country,surrounded by<br />\nenemies, whose only goal is to survive,<br />\nSharaf reviewed the events before and<br />\nafter the founding of Israel. British compliance with Zionist demands led to the<br />\nU. N. partition plan for the creation of<br />\nboth Israeli and Arab states in Palestine, he observed. Israeli terrorists,<br />\nclaimed Sharaf, started driving Palestinian Arabs out of the country even before the country was partitioned.<br />\n<br />\nColonial Policy<br />\nThe Jordanian Ambassador charged<br />\nthat since then Israel has pursued a policy of \"colonialism\". He mentioned that<br />\nin the war of 1948, in which Arab countires attacked the newly-formed Israel<br />\nenlarged her territory by twenty five,<br />\npercent, and that in the 1967 war, she<br />\nhad trepled her territory at the expense<br />\nof the Arab nations.<br />\nSharaf said that it was Israel's refusal<br />\nto deal with the Arab refugee situation<br />\nthat \"kept the problem alive.\" It is<br />\nIsrael's intransigence on this issue,<br />\nsuggested Sharaf, that provokes a justifiably emotional reaction on the part of<br />\nArab commando groups. He reiterated<br />\nArab demands that the refugees \"be allowed to go back to their homes or be<br />\ncompensated.<br />\nAcknowledging the audience's proIsrael feeling, Sharaf urged them to be,<br />\nopen-minded. \"It doesn't help either<br />\nside to insist on one point and to live<br />\nwith it in complete self-reighteousness.<br />\nBecause if what is needed and what is<br />\nwanted is peace in the area it will not<br />\nbe achieved by discrediting completely<br />\nthe other side,\" he commented.<br />\nThere was some heckling during the<br />\nAmbassador's speech and during the<br />\nquestion and answer period.<br />\n<br />\nCODE Working to Dispel Drug Myths;<br />\nTrying To Address Itself to Community<br />\nBy MIKE MAC ADAMS<br />\nSomewhat like the weather, most<br />\neverybody talks about drug abuse but<br />\nfew do anything about it. One of these<br />\nfew is the Committee on Drug Education<br />\n(CODE) here at Homewood.<br />\nThis organization of Hopkins students<br />\nis actively engaged in a number of endeavors to dispell the many myths surrounding drugs and provide aid and counseling for those who may feel they need<br />\nit.<br />\nPresently, according to William Klausmeier, chairman of CODE, the purpose<br />\nof the organization is two-fold. Primarily, it concentrates on compiling and<br />\ndistributing, verbally or through literature, objective scientific and accumate<br />\nlegal information on drug usage.<br />\n<br />\nDrug Newsletter<br />\nTo this end a periodical containing<br />\nrecent scientific and legal information<br />\nis being organized. This newsletter<br />\nwill be distributed in the near future<br />\nto a variety of institutions where it<br />\nmay, hopefully, reach and inform a<br />\ngreat number of concerned individuals.<br />\nDr. William Bevon, chairman of the Advisory Board of the Chaplain's Offices<br />\nis helping to raise $500 for the publication.<br />\nSecondly, CODE sponsors rehabilitative efforts for those who have become<br />\naddicted to or have experienced harmful results from the use of drugs. Here,<br />\nKlausmeier asserted, a great deal needs<br />\nto be done while \"little effort is being<br />\nmade.\" He strongly maintained that the<br />\nattitude of punishment rather than assistance for these people is entirely and<br />\nemphatically wrong. However, he added, these facilities are lamentably un-<br />\n<br />\ndermanned and poorly endowed.<br />\nIn addition to their forthcoming publication, CODE has arranged weekly<br />\npresentations by various knowledgeable<br />\nauthorities on the medical, social and<br />\n:legal aspects of drugs: -.(These meetings are usually held on Wednesday<br />\nnights at 7:30 in Levering Hall.)<br />\n<br />\n'High School Audience\u2022<br />\nThose members qualified have spoken audiences of high school students<br />\nas well as organizations such as the<br />\nKiwanis and Lion's Clubs. Many legislative and government officials as<br />\nwell as legal authorities have been<br />\nsought out and the situation discussed at length with them.<br />\nFor those interested in reading further, CODE has provided over 50 articles on relevant topics (which may be<br />\nfound in Hutzler Reading Room in Gilman Hall) and is presently compiling a<br />\nsubject index file of over 3000 separate<br />\nand related publications.<br />\nConceived after the narcotics raid at<br />\nHopkins in the spring of last year pointed out rather dramatically the \"ignorance of the general public and the legal<br />\ninequities regarding drug use,\" CODE<br />\noriginally focused of the legal aspects<br />\nof drug abuse. However, its unsuccessful petition to Governor Mandel requesting him to re-examine and re-appraise<br />\nthe existing narcotics state laws, though<br />\nsupported by Many prominant citizens<br />\nled to a redirection of these efforts.<br />\nNo longer proposing through referendum legal reform or social acceptance of \"a natural human inclination\"<br />\nto use drugs, it endeavors, instead, to<br />\ngain increased understanding of the relative toxic, addictive and euphoric qua-<br />\n<br />\nHope to Graduate<br />\nDespite Failure<br />\n<br />\nWillie Klausmeier, Chairman of CODE,<br />\ncontended that it is wrong to punish a drug<br />\nuser.<br />\nplc by hill<br />\nlities of the commonly used (and abused) drugs within the community.<br />\nPerhaps the most significant indication of the importance and timeliness<br />\nof CODE is the recent 83 to 0 Senate<br />\napproval of an amendment to the federal narcotics statuates concerning marijuana which makes its sale or possession in small quantities a misdemeanor<br />\nrather than a felony.<br />\nAccording to Klausmeier, CODE<br />\nplans to continue the projects which have<br />\nalready begun.<br />\n\"Hopefully, enough<br />\npeople can be reached that the program<br />\ncan clai'm to have helped clear up some<br />\nof the controversy and to have aided<br />\npublic acceptance of reasonable solutions,\" he concluded.<br />\n<br />\nDean Carl Swanson: \"I don't know what<br />\nI'd do.\"<br />\npic by lemm<br />\nThe freshman boycott of physical education class last semester may turn out<br />\nto be disastrous for those who chose not<br />\nto return to class.<br />\nThis assessment is based on the refusal of the Academic Council to consider<br />\nFreshman President Dave Charry's request earlier this month for the addition<br />\nof a retroactive clause to the resolution<br />\nabolishing the physical education requirement.<br />\nThus, according to Dean Carl P.Swanson, if the regulations are adhered to,<br />\nthose students who haven't fulfilled their<br />\nP.E. requirement sometime before June,<br />\n1973, will not graduate.<br />\nlie further explained that if any leniency would be given, it would come from<br />\nthe Academic Standing Committee,a body<br />\nwhich examines the credentials of every<br />\ncandidate for a degree.<br />\n<br />\nDon't Count On It<br />\nHowever, since the Academic Council<br />\nhas taken action, Swanson warned that<br />\nhe \"would advise no student to bank<br />\non<br />\nthe mercy of the Academic Standing<br />\nCommittee.\" He also stated that to<br />\nhis knowledge, no student has graduated without fulfilling the P.E. requirement.<br />\nThe freshman boycott of P.E., which<br />\nbegan in early November, still includes<br />\na substantial number of persons. According to Marshall Turner, Athletic<br />\nDirector, 140 freshmen failed P.E. at<br />\nthe end of the first semester. Of those<br />\n140, 35 have returned.<br />\nThus, 105<br />\nfreshman still have not fulfilled their<br />\nP.E. requirement.<br />\nIn December the Academic Council,<br />\non the recommendation of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee, voted to withdraw<br />\nthe one-year gym requirement for graduation.<br />\nThe ruling became effective<br />\nonly for students entering Hopkins after<br />\nJanuary, 1970, thus excluding the 140<br />\nfreshman boycotters.<br />\nDavid Charry, President of the<br />\nfreshman class, claimed that the administration's refusal to grant amnesty<br />\nto the boycotters was \"childish,\" and<br />\nremarked, \"There is no question that the<br />\ndecision was a punishment against the<br />\nboycotters.\"<br />\nTurner explained that normally 2025 freshmen fail P.E. every year. He<br />\nnoted that by their senior year all of<br />\nthese people have made the course up.<br />\nDean Swanson, when confronted with<br />\nthe aforementioned figures, stated that<br />\nhe would not like to be Dean in 1973,<br />\nL since the situation would be sticky\"...<br />\nWhen pressed for his opinion as to<br />\nwhat would occur, he replied, \"I don't<br />\nknow what I'd do.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, according to Charry, the<br />\nfreshmen are \"laying low.\" They hope<br />\nthat by 1973, when the sting of the issue<br />\nis gone,the boycotters can graduate without incident.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 27, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Black Studies Plan<br />\nRotting in Academic Council<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\n<br />\nout of Black Studies, as sooner or<br />\n-later we'll have to deal with this.\"<br />\nHe felt that the program definitely should<br />\nbe in Black Studies, as opposed to African Studies.<br />\nFurther, Dyson-Hudson stated that any<br />\nprogram of this type should be a cooperative venture between Hopkins and Morgan State. To see if this was practical,<br />\nDyson-Hudson, Judd, and Jim Wyche,another graduate student, met with three<br />\nMorgan officials: the Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences, a representative of the planning Department, and the Chairman of the<br />\nHistory Department,who heads Morgan's<br />\nblack studies program. There seemed to<br />\nbe enthusiasm for the idea.<br />\n\"If you enter- the area of Black Studies,\" Dyson-Hudson stated, \"you either<br />\nhave to compete with black schools or<br />\ncooperate with one.\" He continued,<br />\n\"Since Hopkins has more money, our<br />\ngrowth (in this area) would be at Morgan's expense.\" He was referring to<br />\nthe trend among top professors in black<br />\nschools to accept high-paying posts in the<br />\nblack studies programs of white universities.<br />\nDyson-Hudson forsaw the graduate end<br />\nof the program taking place mainly on<br />\nthe Homewood campus and undergraduate<br />\ncourses centered at Morgan. He pointed<br />\nout several people at Hopkins who would<br />\nbe qualified to direct graduate research<br />\nin this field including himself in anthropology, and Dr. Mary Ainsworth in Psychology.<br />\nDyson-Hudson also envisioned a semester in Africa as part of the program.<br />\nOne semester would be spent at an African University, such as the University<br />\nof Nairobi and then the vacation following that semester would be spent travel ing in Africa.<br />\nAlthough he spoke emphatically against<br />\n<br />\nFor more than a year, a proposal<br />\nfor a Black Studies program has lain<br />\ndormant in the Academic Council.<br />\nThis proposal originated when Dri<br />\nGeorge Owen, Chairman of the Physics<br />\nDepartment, sent a letter to the Council, outlining a program, which was<br />\ndrawn up in consultation with Dr. Neville Dyson-Hudson, Professor of Social<br />\nRelations.<br />\nThe Council referred the matter to<br />\nDean Carl Swanson who, acting as a<br />\ncommittee of one, assessed Hopkins'<br />\ncurrent course offerings, asking which<br />\ncould be placed in the program he referred to as \"Ethnic Studies,\" He<br />\nsuggested Economics of Poverty as an<br />\nexample of such a course. He drew up<br />\na brief report on this examination for<br />\nthe Council.<br />\nDr. Owen explained that the idea for<br />\nhis proposal came out of a conversation between himself, President Gordon and Dennis Judd, a black graduate<br />\nstudent in Physics.<br />\nOwen said that he wanted to develop<br />\na program which was \"academically,<br />\nvery respectable,\" in accordance with<br />\nthe wishes of the black students he had<br />\ntalked to. He contrasted this to some<br />\nblack studies programs which he termed an \"insult\" to the black students.<br />\nOwen envisaged the program as \"African Studies\".<br />\nIn an effort to achieve this respectability, Owen contacted Dyson-Hudson,<br />\nan anthropologist who has studied in<br />\nAfrica for eight years and is a member of a tribe in Uganda.<br />\nDyson-Hudson noted, \"There are one<br />\nmillion ways of doing this wrong and<br />\nthere may be a way of doing it right.\"<br />\nNevertheless, he went on to say, \"I<br />\ndon't think Hopkins can or should stay<br />\n<br />\noit/bid,<br />\nImpoztrs<br />\n<br />\n_ incense<br />\ncandles<br />\n<br />\nwater pipes<br />\njewelry<br />\nbalalaikas<br />\n<br />\n10c; discount with Goucher or Hopkins I.

He<br />\nalso felt that Hopkins should reciprocate<br />\nin any such program, allowing African<br />\nstudents to spend some time here.<br />\nDyson-Hudson asserted that it should<br />\nbe relatively easy to finance such aprogram, pointing out that a cooperative venture between a black university and a<br />\nwhite university should be very attractive<br />\nto foundations. Part of the expense, according to Dyson-Hudson, might be<br />\nincurred helping Morgan to pay some<br />\nfaculty salaries. He said, \"This really<br />\nought to be a joint operation, not just a<br />\npretended one.\"<br />\nDyson-Hudson states that he does not<br />\nwant this to be an area-studies program,<br />\n<br />\nwhich he says has been \"a flop in America.\" Nor does he want it to be another<br />\nexample of what he called \"Hopkins metoo-ism.\" \"Just as the rest of the<br />\nworld discovers it doesn't really work,<br />\nHopkins comes along with its program,\"<br />\nhe stated.<br />\nHe also spoke against merely \"repackaging\" current course offerings and<br />\ncalling it black studies.

Warhead<br />\ndesigns and experiments have been carried out to explore the feasibility of particular concepts, including augmentation of the terminal effectiveness of the Terrier<br />\nmissile designs and new components to older missiles to improve fleet air defense<br />\ncapability is a subject of continuing study.<br />\n\u2014Report of the Director, Applied Physics Laboratory, 1968<br />\n<br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory in Silver Springs, Md. is, indeed, an<br />\nextention of the government's military complex. Operating under a $50<br />\nmillion<br />\na year contract with the Navy, APL sponsors research in land and<br />\n_<br />\nsea missile technology as well as radar and satellite equipment for Navy<br />\nwarcraft. Last year, 51% of all research was classified in the 2500-man<br />\nlaboratory.<br />\nAfter years of wondering, some students are now ready to ask the<br />\nUniversity some hard questions on why we are still in the missile business.<br />\nSo far the administration has attempted to answer this question with<br />\nthree arguments. One is the \"realist\" point of view. \"Sure war is regrettable,\" they say, \"but it's here to stay, so we must be prepared to defend<br />\nourselves,\" There hardly seems any need to quote the numerous psychologists and other experts on the \"war game\" who refute this tired and hackneyed reply.<br />\nThe second answer was voiced recently by Vice-President William Bevan<br />\nwhen he stated that APL is \"a scholarly institution, not a service institution.'\" Although this is presently debatable, APL could be salvaged and<br />\nmade into a facility which helps mankind instead of taking orders from<br />\nthe military machine.<br />\nThis reversal requires telling the government that it must begin to<br />\nrestructure its research priorities if it wants the benefits and brillant<br />\nscientists which Hopkins leads to APL. Bevan noted that without Hopkins<br />\naffliation, APL would collapse. Few of its employees would work under<br />\nthe restrictions of the Navy. Instead of applauding the fact that civilians<br />\nare working on classified research, as President Gordon did last fall, we<br />\nshould be appalled that Hopkins is allowing its name and prestige to be<br />\nused in such a manner.<br />\nCurrently, 20% of APL research is non-defense, including a $1 million<br />\nmass-transit contract. Hopkins should demand much more work in such<br />\nsocially useful research at APL.<br />\nThis brings us to the third argument against restructuring APL. If we<br />\nended all military contracts, they say, APL would never receive as much<br />\nnon-defense research. This reflects the age-old, head-in-the-sand approach<br />\nof academia towards the government. Instead of trying to influence<br />\ngovernmental priorities in research, the University takes the government's<br />\ndecisions as God-given, and proceeds to obey governmental commands<br />\nwith utmost efficiency.<br />\nHopkins must begin to reverse the trend of University dependence on<br />\nWashington. Instead of being supplicants to the research contract, the<br />\nUniversity must attempt to influence the government's policies. The place<br />\nto start is at Silver Springs.<br />\nRichard B.

Even when behind<br />\nby a large score,the players have always<br />\nmaintained a high degree of sportsmanship, an important element in college<br />\nathletics.<br />\nWhen many of us attend basketball<br />\ngames, we become part of the action<br />\nthrough cheering and heckling members of the opposing team. This ability<br />\nto feel close to the game and to \"get<br />\nto\" other players is part of what makes<br />\nbasketball such an exciting spectator<br />\nsport.<br />\nLast week, however, many of the fans<br />\nput on exhibition which made me ashamed<br />\nof being a Hopkins student. Hopkins'<br />\nopponent was Ursinus. It was a close<br />\ngame and many of us were heckling the<br />\nUrsinus players. There was one black<br />\nplayer on the Ursinus team and he was<br />\ntaking exceptional abuse. Many of the<br />\nfans stopped yelling at the other players and shouted his name whether he<br />\nhad the ball or not; others snickered.<br />\nWhen the player fouled out and sat<br />\ndown, some students used the safety of<br />\nthe crowd to continue riding him. One<br />\nstudent made a particularly unnecessary<br />\nremark which prompted the black player<br />\nand the Ursinus coach to turn and repri-<br />\n<br />\nmand him. I am sure that the impression which the coach and many of his<br />\nplayers carried home, of our school, is<br />\nnot very complimentary.<br />\nIncidents like this should not occur<br />\nat Hopkins. If some individuals maintain an infantile desire to express warped ideas, while using the safety of the<br />\ncrowd as a shield, they should go somewhere else; not to the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center.<br />\nThere is nothing wrong with riding<br />\nan opposing player, but sports are sports.<br />\nOur teams have given Hopkins a reputation as a school with good sportsmanship on the field. Let's not see our fans<br />\ndestroy that reputation from the stands.<br />\n<br />\nLawrence J.

Not<br />\nonly is he the submarine sandwich czar<br />\nof the greater Baltimore area,(besides<br />\nbeing mad about jazz) but he is also the<br />\nExecutive Vice-President of the North<br />\nCharles General Hospital, and the City<br />\nCommissioner of the State Roads Commission.<br />\nAnd just what does this bring to mind?<br />\nA prominent man? A Babbitt perhaps? A<br />\ngreaseball, crew-cut, bagg3f-suit,State.<br />\nof Maryland tie-clip, go-getter, hardcharger--booster extraordinaire?<br />\nNot quite.<br />\nMore likely a man who just digs what<br />\nhe's doing, and believes that anyone would<br />\nbe foolish if he wasn't trying to do the<br />\nsame thing. That kind of person is hard<br />\nto find in this day and age,especially over<br />\nthe semi-mythical thirty-year dividing<br />\nline.<br />\nAnd Mr. Brinsfield does not confine<br />\nhis belief in social freedom to mere intramural Establishment-type activities.<br />\n<br />\nHe is of the opinion that there is nothing<br />\nintrinsically wrong with hippies(whoever<br />\nthey are) and that they should be allowed<br />\nto \"stay with their own thing.\" On the<br />\nother hand, he wryly and perhaps incorrectly feels that the campus Nietzsche of<br />\ntoday is the mill grinder of tomorrow, a<br />\nquote borrowed from H.L. Mencken.<br />\nWell then, you ask, where did this<br />\ndude come from? Just a little over fifty<br />\nyears ago, Harley Brinsfield was a downhome, Eastern Shore country boy. It<br />\nwas there, down on the proverbial farm,<br />\nthat Harley Brinsfield became aware of<br />\nthat mysterious, powerful, plaintive,<br />\nroot-american art form ---the blues.<br />\nThe young boy started listening to the<br />\nblacks in his immediate environment sing<br />\nand play gospel and blues music. From<br />\nhere the step to modern jazz and dixieland, though a long one, is almost inevitable for a white man.<br />\nThis sustained interest has enabled<br />\nMr. Brinsfield to become, in effect, the<br />\nnumber one jazz fan in the country. Mr.<br />\nBrinsfield is no frustrated musician,<br />\neither, like so many other critics and<br />\nbuffs. He claims that his only musical<br />\nendeavor was drumming in the boy scout<br />\nban, an avocation that didn't last long.<br />\nBut his appreciation for the black man's<br />\nmusic that became jazz has never left<br />\nhim.<br />\nTime passed, as it is wont to do, and<br />\nsoon we find Harley in the Coast Guard,<br />\nwhere overseas he discovered the submarine sandwich. These unique mother<br />\nbruisers fascinated him as much as jazz<br />\nmusic did, for he has parlayed the little<br />\nbuggers into a comfortable living by<br />\nselling them. After being discharged<br />\nfrom the service, Harley and his wife<br />\nset up the first sub shop in the city, down<br />\nin the old Lexington Market. Now, it is<br />\ndifficult to drive anywhere in the city<br />\nwithout being constantly tempted by the<br />\nidea of sticking your mouth around a<br />\nHarleyburger.<br />\nIn due time, Mr. Brinsfield became a<br />\nprominent man in the affairs ofthe city<br />\nas previously mentioned as well as keeping close tabs on the smoky world of jazz.<br />\nAs far as Harley is concerned, keeping<br />\n\u2022,<br />\n(continued on page 7),<br />\n<br />\n\fFeb. 27, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nfeatures\u2014mm<br />\n<br />\nDo It, Jimmy!Scoop Me! Houp-lal<br />\nBy JIMMY OLSENBERG<br />\nMy closest brush with journalistic<br />\nglory came when I was luckily chosen to<br />\ndrive the radio car for the New York<br />\nDaily News photographers who were covering a peace demonstration. The News,<br />\nof course, tries to make every demonstration seem as small and violent as<br />\nPossible. For example, during the Chicago police riots in 1968, their photographers were specifically instructed to<br />\nget shots of vicious hippies provoking<br />\nChicago's Finest. Anyway, for this demonstration, the News chose, among<br />\nothers, ace photographer Mel Finkelstein, who had the misfortune of being<br />\njudoed into submission by the otherwise<br />\namiable Mrs. Onassis.<br />\nAs I was driving these old pros to the<br />\nrally at Central Park, one of the photographers turned to me, and earnestly<br />\nsaid, \"You know, maybe they do believe<br />\nwhat they're hollering about. But when<br />\nthey don't take a bath, for Chrissake,<br />\nhow the hell can you believe them?\"<br />\nGrabbing me by the shoulder, he continued, \"Just tell me this, buddy: Why<br />\ncan't they be clean like other people? Why<br />\ndon't they ever take a bath? I don't understand it!\" In the back seat, Mel said,<br />\n\"Yeah. But some of those hippie broads<br />\naren't so bad-looking, you know what I<br />\nmean? They don't wear any bras, and<br />\nso when they walk around you can see<br />\ntheir boobs shaking. Some of those<br />\nbroads got a good pair of knockers on<br />\nthem.\"<br />\n<br />\nMy Big Chance<br />\nAfter dropping them off at the park,<br />\nI had to wait outside in case they had to<br />\nradio in anything from their walkie-talkies. As I was waiting in the car, a pack<br />\nof demonstrators came hurtling out of the<br />\npark, and ran screaming down one of the<br />\nside streets. I realized; here was my big<br />\nchance!<br />\nA story was breaking before my very<br />\neyes, and by radioing in the information<br />\nI could give the News a dramatic scoop.<br />\nYes, I could see it now! I would return<br />\nto the city room fatigued, but happy.<br />\nEveryone would stop their work,and gaze<br />\nin, silent awe as I casually walked past the<br />\nrows of desks. Then, first one reporter,<br />\nthen another, and still another, would<br />\nrush up to me, pat me on the back, and<br />\nexclaim, \"Great job, Jimmy! You're<br />\none hell of a reporter!\" I, of course,<br />\nwould humbly accept all their compliments, and in my best Gary Cooper<br />\nfashion, I'd say, \"Shucks, fellas, it was<br />\n<br />\nOMAA FAVOR PAL. A 1JUM6ER.<br />\n<br />\nPO ,<br />\n1 16 A<br />\nFAUX.Pik<br />\nMY MOTHER.<br />\n<br />\nnothing really.\"<br />\nWhile I'm thinking all this, a flock of<br />\nblue-helmeted motorcycle cops burst out<br />\nof the park and followed the break-way<br />\ndeomonstrators, My God! Police Brutality! Another Chicago!<br />\nGrabbing the<br />\nradio mike, I pressed down the button<br />\non the mike, and began screamingfrantically,\"This is car 72 here, can you read<br />\nme? Car 72 here, can you read me?\"<br />\nBroderick Crawford would have been<br />\nproud. I continued, getting desparate because I was geeting no answer from the<br />\noffice. \"The cops...they're chasing the<br />\ndemonstrators down this street! They're<br />\nrunning down the street, and the cops...<br />\nthe cops...are trying to get them! It's<br />\nincredible! Wait a minute, there's some<br />\nmore demonstrators...and...and\u2014some<br />\nmore cops! Oh my God! I can't believe it!\"<br />\nBy now, I had completely lost control<br />\nof myself, my face was contorted with<br />\nrage. Actually, nobody was being brutalized, but it looked like it, so I kept shouting, \"Car 72 here. Can you read me? Can<br />\nyou read me?\" All the while I kept wondering why theywouldn't answer me. Was<br />\nit a fascist conspiracy to repress the<br />\ntruth? After raving for at least another<br />\nten minutes, I let the mike slip out of my<br />\nhand, and leaned back into the driver's<br />\nseat in limp exhaustion. I had done my<br />\nduty and I closed my eyes as images of<br />\nPulitzer Prizes filtered through my<br />\nmind.<br />\n<br />\nGood Night, Jimmy<br />\nSuddenly there came from the radio<br />\na harsh static sound. At last, my heroics were being recognized. Expectantly,<br />\nI leaned forward. \"Listen, Car 72, you<br />\nschmuck!\" Yes, I thought, the truth hurts<br />\nthem too much and so they take it out<br />\non me. The voice continued, \"We've<br />\nheard you for twenty minutes, you moron,<br />\nbut you forgot to take yout finger off the<br />\nbutton on the mike so we could answer<br />\nyou.\" With a queasy feeling in my stomach, I signed off. And then, allover the<br />\ncity, the other News radio cars said in<br />\nUnison, \"Good night, Chet!\" For days<br />\nafterward, I sheepishly had to endure remarks sarcastically saying, \"Great job,<br />\nJimmy! You're one hell of a reporter!\"<br />\nWhat the News is most famous for,<br />\nthough, is its lurid emphasis on sex and<br />\nviolence. While attacking pornography in<br />\nits editorials, it was not reluctant to show<br />\non page 3 some young starlet, newly arrived at Kennedy airport, sitting atop her<br />\nluggage, with her mini-skirt riding up to<br />\nher crotch.

The<br />\nKennedy accident over the summer is a<br />\ngood example of this. At the Times,when<br />\nthe story first came in over thewire,the<br />\ncopy editor must have said something<br />\nlike, \"Senator Kennedy will probably be<br />\nfaced with the necessity of reappraising<br />\nhis Presidential aspirations due to this<br />\nunfortunate accident. However, we must<br />\nnot be too hasty in our judgments.\" At<br />\nthe News, it was somewhat different.Sitting as the head copy editor, surrounded<br />\nby a horse-shoe copy desk, was a thin,<br />\nirritable old man, whose left hand was<br />\nhorribly palsied. As he read the first<br />\nnews on the Kennedy accident, he sagely<br />\nobserved, \"he was loaded and he was<br />\nscrewin' the blonde.\" The News played<br />\nthe accident to the hilt: Day after day,<br />\nheadlines<br />\nscreamed,<br />\n\"MOTHER<br />\nPLEADS: WHY WON'T THEY LEAVE<br />\nMARY JO ALONE?\" and \"TEDDY<br />\nWEEPS<br />\nAT KOPECHNE FUNERAL.<br />\nMARY JO A 'GOOD GIRL' FATHER<br />\n,SAYS.\"<br />\nOne issue is espcially vivid in this<br />\nregard, a towering masterpiece of puerile journalism that would make even the<br />\nBoston Strangler a bit queasy. Under an<br />\n<br />\nInside, was the article on the boy who<br />\nwas seriously- burnt in a Times Square<br />\nsubway station. The grisly lead paragraph, in the usual sensationalist fashion,<br />\nwas in extra-large dark type, and of<br />\ncourse it went into intricate detail on the<br />\nexact nature of the burns. Filtered<br />\nthrough the rest of the issue were some<br />\nmore brutalities, including one childbeating, three rapes, and at least four<br />\nhit-and-run accidents.

The liberals, aligning themselves with the immediate integration position of the Supreme Court, may be on the verge of a<br />\npyrrhic victory.<br />\nLast week's White<br />\nHouse dismissal of<br />\nliberal<br />\ncivil rights<br />\nchief<br />\nLeon Panetta<br />\nNEWS<br />\nsignalled what Time<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\nmagazine had called<br />\nthe end of the Second<br />\nReconstruction.<br />\nBut there remains a glimmer of confused hope here in Maryland with the<br />\nfederal rejection of the state's plans<br />\nfor integrating public colleges.<br />\nThe sixty day deadline for submission<br />\nof a new plan was waived by HEW last<br />\nweek while Panetta was being wedged out<br />\n<br />\nMr. Leon Panetta, HEW civil rights chief,<br />\nwas forced out of office last week by the<br />\nWhite House for his pursuit of an immediateintegration policy.<br />\n<br />\nof a job. At the same time, it was learned from Maryland Secretary of State<br />\nBlaire Lee that HEW had not actually<br />\n\"rejected\" the state's integration proposals. It had merely found them \"not<br />\nacceptable.\"<br />\nLack of a Theme<br />\nThe confusion lies in the yaeueries of<br />\nHEW's \"non-acceptance\" order and the<br />\nlack oi a definable temporal theme behind it.<br />\nRegional civil rights chief Eloise Severinson rejected the state's plan because<br />\nit \"suffers from certain limitations.\"<br />\nMore specifically, the plan failed to meet<br />\nHEW guidelines (suggestions) in at least<br />\nfour areas. The lack of proposed programs for phasing out degenerating insitutions such as Coppin State, merging<br />\nothers, creating specific attendance<br />\nzones and instituting domains of academic specialization for each of<br />\nthe<br />\nstate's colleges.<br />\nHEW further ciriticized the state's<br />\n<br />\nplans contending that, although their implementation would brine. about greater<br />\nnumerical integration, they would not address the problem oi overcomii* the<br />\nstrong historic racial identification of<br />\neach of the state's colleges. The University of Maryland at College Park,<br />\nfor example is 99 per cent white,whereas its Princess Anne County branch is<br />\n92 per cent black.<br />\nThe original desegregation order was<br />\nhanded down from HEW last March,with<br />\na 90 day deadline for the submission of<br />\nan outline. Then came a 120 day deadline for submission of a formal plan,<br />\nwhich was submitted on time, October<br />\n1.<br />\nEach of the state's colleges workedon<br />\nits own plan, which it then submitted to<br />\nthe state college board of trustees for<br />\nconsolidation and approval.<br />\n<br />\nBlacks Hit Racism in High Schools<br />\nThe recent disturbances in the Baltimore public schools were the result of<br />\ngrievances that have been simmering for<br />\nmany months.<br />\nTo Baltimore's black high school students, one of the major sources of discontent is what they feel is the racism<br />\nof many of the older white teachers in<br />\nthe school system.<br />\nAt the all-girl Eastern High School,<br />\na group of predominantly middle-class<br />\nblacks, known as Black Voice, had been<br />\npetitioning the principal since October<br />\nover what they charged was the racism<br />\nof Dorothy Schepler, a 40-year veteran<br />\nof the school system. They had gotten<br />\nno response and on February 12 they<br />\ntried to confront Schepler with their<br />\ncharges.<br />\nA crowd gathered and eventually the<br />\npolice were called in. Eleven students<br />\nwere arrested and, according to some<br />\nstudents, the police were brutal in dispersing the crowd and at the police station. Some girls went over to the allboy City College High School and some<br />\nCity students tried to,cross Loch Raven<br />\nBoulevard to get to Eastern, but they<br />\nwere met by police.

The SAC also set up a subcommittee to consider what<br />\nshould be included in such a<br />\ncenter.<br />\nVice-President William Bevan<br />\nwas asked to appoint an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to study priorities for a<br />\nstudent Union by Gordon, despite<br />\nthe SAC's sub-committee. Both<br />\nbodies are presently studying what<br />\nis needed in a student union and<br />\nif a temporary center is available<br />\nwhile a permanent one is being<br />\nconstructed.<br /><br />\nRichard Cramer<br /><br />\nhoffmann<br /><br />\nSeveral members of the SAC<br />\nhave expressed concern that the<br />\nad hoc 'administration committee<br />\nwas designed to pre-empt the subcommittee. The sub-committee<br />\nmet for the first time this week to<br />\ndiscuss both permanent and interim plans for a student facility.<br />\nThe SAC's January resolution<br />\nsuggested that Shriver Hall be used<br />\nto house student activity officies<br />\nand other social and recreational<br />\nfacilities \u2022after the completion of<br />\nthe new administration building.<br />\nAt that time the admissions, registrar and public relations offices<br />\nwill be moved out of Shriver to<br />\nthe new building.<br />\nOne member of the administration said that .the building has<br />\ntentatively been promised to The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University Press.<br />\nHe also noted that the promise<br />\nwas not a firm one but that the<br /><br />\nWilliam Bevan<br /><br />\nhoffmann<br /><br />\nJohn McElwee<br /><br />\nChester Wickwire<br />\nPress was in dire need of the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nAt its first meeting last week,<br />\nthe, ad hoc committee discussed<br />\nwhat should be included in a<br />\ntemporary student center. Richard<br />\nCramer, an undergraduate member of the administration appointed committee, feared that the<br />\nbody will neglect to consider long<br />\nterm needs of the student body<br />\nwhile designing a temporary facility.<br />\nCramer also expressed concern<br />\nthat the special needs of Hopkins<br />\nstudents will be overlooked in the<br />\nplanning because the committee is<br />\nusing examples from other colleges<br />\nto build its own center. He claimed<br />\nthat \"individual rather than group<br />\nactivities should be stressed\" in the<br />\nplanning due to the solitary<br />\norientation of the student body.<br /><br />\n&gt;\u2022<br />\nlemm<br /><br />\nThe ad hoc committee, chaired<br />\nby John McElwee, Director of<br />\nPlant Planning, began its work by<br />\nsetting priorities for an interim<br />\ncenter to be possibly housed in<br />\nShriver Hall. They did not discuss<br />\nany long range plans.for planning a<br />\npermanent student union. Other<br />\nmembers of the committee include<br />\nDean Carl Swanson, Dr. Chester<br />\nWickwire and grad student Donna<br />\nWilson.<br />\nThere are several reasons why<br />\nShriver Hall may not be a possible<br />\nchoice for an interim facility besides the promise to the Hopkins<br />\nPress. It is a general university<br />\nbuilding that is not designated to<br />\nbe used for solely Homewood<br />\nactivities.<br />\nShriver also may not be large<br />\nenough to house all the'activities<br />\nthat should be included in a stu-,<br />\ndent center, according to Dr..<br />\nBevan.

He stated that he<br />\nand the Arab people \"believe that we<br />\nhave in common with young Jews and<br />\nold Jews common ideas and common<br />\nconcerns.\"<br />\n\"We don't regard the conflict that<br />\ntook place in the Middle East and that<br />\ncontinues, unfortunately in an intensified form, as a conflict between Arabs<br />\nand Jews,\" he commented.<br />\nEmphasizing that the Jews are a religious, not a political entity, Sharaf<br />\nsaid that the Arabs' quarrel was with<br />\nZionism. He claimed that the conflict<br />\nbetween \"the Arabs, who lived in that<br />\nPart of the world for many, many cen-<br /><br />\nturies, and what from our point of view<br />\nis and invading, colonial, militarist movement, based on exclusiveness.\"<br /><br />\nReligious Exclusiveness<br />\nSharaf made the point several times<br />\nthat in Israel, \"religious as well as<br />\nracial\" exclusiveness was an institution. Anti-semitism in Arab countries,<br />\nhe said, is only a reaction to Israeli<br />\nintolerance and is not institutionalized.<br />\nHe also suggested that this Zionist exclusiveness was \"not only not identical<br />\nwith Judaism, but the very antithesis<br />\nof Judaism.\"<br />\nThe Ambassador claimed that the<br />\nformation of Israel was a reaction to<br />\nWestern persecution of the Jews. What<br />\nshould have been created, said Sharaf,<br />\nwas an atmosphere of religious tolerance in the Western world. He implied that the Arab nations were bearing the brunt of Western guilt even<br />\nthough they had nothing to do with the<br /><br />\nJordanian Ambassador Abdul Amid Sharaf: \"The West at one point wanted to relieve its own<br />\n_guilt by giving Israel a carte blanche to do whatever it wanted.plc by hoffmann<br /><br />\npersecution of the Jews. \"The West<br />\nat one point wanted to relieve its own<br />\nguilt by giving Israel a carte blanche to<br />\ndo whatever it wanted,\" he commented.<br />\nAttacking the idea that Israel is a<br />\nsmall beleagured country,surrounded by<br />\nenemies, whose only goal is to survive,<br />\nSharaf reviewed the events before and<br />\nafter the founding of Israel. British compliance with Zionist demands led to the<br />\nU. N. partition plan for the creation of<br />\nboth Israeli and Arab states in Palestine, he observed. Israeli terrorists,<br />\nclaimed Sharaf, started driving Palestinian Arabs out of the country even before the country was partitioned.<br /><br />\nColonial Policy<br />\nThe Jordanian Ambassador charged<br />\nthat since then Israel has pursued a policy of \"colonialism\". He mentioned that<br />\nin the war of 1948, in which Arab countires attacked the newly-formed Israel<br />\nenlarged her territory by twenty five,<br />\npercent, and that in the 1967 war, she<br />\nhad trepled her territory at the expense<br />\nof the Arab nations.<br />\nSharaf said that it was Israel's refusal<br />\nto deal with the Arab refugee situation<br />\nthat \"kept the problem alive.\" It is<br />\nIsrael's intransigence on this issue,<br />\nsuggested Sharaf, that provokes a justifiably emotional reaction on the part of<br />\nArab commando groups. He reiterated<br />\nArab demands that the refugees \"be allowed to go back to their homes or be<br />\ncompensated.<br />\nAcknowledging the audience's proIsrael feeling, Sharaf urged them to be,<br />\nopen-minded. \"It doesn't help either<br />\nside to insist on one point and to live<br />\nwith it in complete self-reighteousness.<br />\nBecause if what is needed and what is<br />\nwanted is peace in the area it will not<br />\nbe achieved by discrediting completely<br />\nthe other side,\" he commented.<br />\nThere was some heckling during the<br />\nAmbassador's speech and during the<br />\nquestion and answer period.<br /><br />\nCODE Working to Dispel Drug Myths;<br />\nTrying To Address Itself to Community<br />\nBy MIKE MAC ADAMS<br />\nSomewhat like the weather, most<br />\neverybody talks about drug abuse but<br />\nfew do anything about it. One of these<br />\nfew is the Committee on Drug Education<br />\n(CODE) here at Homewood.<br />\nThis organization of Hopkins students<br />\nis actively engaged in a number of endeavors to dispell the many myths surrounding drugs and provide aid and counseling for those who may feel they need<br />\nit.<br />\nPresently, according to William Klausmeier, chairman of CODE, the purpose<br />\nof the organization is two-fold. Primarily, it concentrates on compiling and<br />\ndistributing, verbally or through literature, objective scientific and accumate<br />\nlegal information on drug usage.<br /><br />\nDrug Newsletter<br />\nTo this end a periodical containing<br />\nrecent scientific and legal information<br />\nis being organized. This newsletter<br />\nwill be distributed in the near future<br />\nto a variety of institutions where it<br />\nmay, hopefully, reach and inform a<br />\ngreat number of concerned individuals.<br />\nDr. William Bevon, chairman of the Advisory Board of the Chaplain's Offices<br />\nis helping to raise $500 for the publication.<br />\nSecondly, CODE sponsors rehabilitative efforts for those who have become<br />\naddicted to or have experienced harmful results from the use of drugs.

Warhead<br />\ndesigns and experiments have been carried out to explore the feasibility of particular concepts, including augmentation of the terminal effectiveness of the Terrier<br />\nmissile designs and new components to older missiles to improve fleet air defense<br />\ncapability is a subject of continuing study.<br />\n\u2014Report of the Director, Applied Physics Laboratory, 1968<br /><br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory in Silver Springs, Md. is, indeed, an<br />\nextention of the government's military complex. Operating under a $50<br />\nmillion<br />\na year contract with the Navy, APL sponsors research in land and<br />\n_<br />\nsea missile technology as well as radar and satellite equipment for Navy<br />\nwarcraft. Last year, 51% of all research was classified in the 2500-man<br />\nlaboratory.<br />\nAfter years of wondering, some students are now ready to ask the<br />\nUniversity some hard questions on why we are still in the missile business.<br />\nSo far the administration has attempted to answer this question with<br />\nthree arguments. One is the \"realist\" point of view. \"Sure war is regrettable,\" they say, \"but it's here to stay, so we must be prepared to defend<br />\nourselves,\" There hardly seems any need to quote the numerous psychologists and other experts on the \"war game\" who refute this tired and hackneyed reply.<br />\nThe second answer was voiced recently by Vice-President William Bevan<br />\nwhen he stated that APL is \"a scholarly institution, not a service institution.'\" Although this is presently debatable, APL could be salvaged and<br />\nmade into a facility which helps mankind instead of taking orders from<br />\nthe military machine.<br />\nThis reversal requires telling the government that it must begin to<br />\nrestructure its research priorities if it wants the benefits and brillant<br />\nscientists which Hopkins leads to APL. Bevan noted that without Hopkins<br />\naffliation, APL would collapse. Few of its employees would work under<br />\nthe restrictions of the Navy. Instead of applauding the fact that civilians<br />\nare working on classified research, as President Gordon did last fall, we<br />\nshould be appalled that Hopkins is allowing its name and prestige to be<br />\nused in such a manner.<br />\nCurrently, 20% of APL research is non-defense, including a $1 million<br />\nmass-transit contract. Hopkins should demand much more work in such<br />\nsocially useful research at APL.<br />\nThis brings us to the third argument against restructuring APL. If we<br />\nended all military contracts, they say, APL would never receive as much<br />\nnon-defense research. This reflects the age-old, head-in-the-sand approach<br />\nof academia towards the government. Instead of trying to influence<br />\ngovernmental priorities in research, the University takes the government's<br />\ndecisions as God-given, and proceeds to obey governmental commands<br />\nwith utmost efficiency.<br />\nHopkins must begin to reverse the trend of University dependence on<br />\nWashington. Instead of being supplicants to the research contract, the<br />\nUniversity must attempt to influence the government's policies. The place<br />\nto start is at Silver Springs.<br />\nRichard B.

Even when behind<br />\nby a large score,the players have always<br />\nmaintained a high degree of sportsmanship, an important element in college<br />\nathletics.<br />\nWhen many of us attend basketball<br />\ngames, we become part of the action<br />\nthrough cheering and heckling members of the opposing team. This ability<br />\nto feel close to the game and to \"get<br />\nto\" other players is part of what makes<br />\nbasketball such an exciting spectator<br />\nsport.<br />\nLast week, however, many of the fans<br />\nput on exhibition which made me ashamed<br />\nof being a Hopkins student. Hopkins'<br />\nopponent was Ursinus. It was a close<br />\ngame and many of us were heckling the<br />\nUrsinus players. There was one black<br />\nplayer on the Ursinus team and he was<br />\ntaking exceptional abuse. Many of the<br />\nfans stopped yelling at the other players and shouted his name whether he<br />\nhad the ball or not; others snickered.<br />\nWhen the player fouled out and sat<br />\ndown, some students used the safety of<br />\nthe crowd to continue riding him. One<br />\nstudent made a particularly unnecessary<br />\nremark which prompted the black player<br />\nand the Ursinus coach to turn and repri-<br /><br />\nmand him. I am sure that the impression which the coach and many of his<br />\nplayers carried home, of our school, is<br />\nnot very complimentary.<br />\nIncidents like this should not occur<br />\nat Hopkins. If some individuals maintain an infantile desire to express warped ideas, while using the safety of the<br />\ncrowd as a shield, they should go somewhere else; not to the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center.<br />\nThere is nothing wrong with riding<br />\nan opposing player, but sports are sports.<br />\nOur teams have given Hopkins a reputation as a school with good sportsmanship on the field.

At about that time you'll hear<br />\na program playing all kinds of jazz (except maybe progressive) sponsored by<br />\nHarley's Sandwich Shops. In point of fact,<br />\nit's called the Harley show; and if you're<br />\nan old timer it may bring back memories<br />\nof the free-wheeling, wanton younger<br />\ndays before you had to worry about kids<br />\n(your own probably)doing things like taking drugs and listening to the weird stuff<br />\nsome hairy British cat dreamed up.<br />\nNo, this isn't a redneck conspiracy,<br />\nnor is it a reactionary plot against youth.<br />\nIt is simply a labor of love. It is done<br />\nlate at night, so that no one except a true<br />\naficianado will be listening. Nothing goes<br />\nover the air except the very best of a now<br />\ndead musical era. And the disc-jockey<br />\nis none other than Mr. Harley Brinsfield<br />\nhinself.<br />\nYou may recall Mr. Brinsfield. Not<br />\nonly is he the submarine sandwich czar<br />\nof the greater Baltimore area,(besides<br />\nbeing mad about jazz) but he is also the<br />\nExecutive Vice-President of the North<br />\nCharles General Hospital, and the City<br />\nCommissioner of the State Roads Commission.<br />\nAnd just what does this bring to mind?<br />\nA prominent man? A Babbitt perhaps? A<br />\ngreaseball, crew-cut, bagg3f-suit,State.<br />\nof Maryland tie-clip, go-getter, hardcharger--booster extraordinaire?<br />\nNot quite.<br />\nMore likely a man who just digs what<br />\nhe's doing, and believes that anyone would<br />\nbe foolish if he wasn't trying to do the<br />\nsame thing. That kind of person is hard<br />\nto find in this day and age,especially over<br />\nthe semi-mythical thirty-year dividing<br />\nline.<br />\nAnd Mr. Brinsfield does not confine<br />\nhis belief in social freedom to mere intramural Establishment-type activities.<br /><br />\nHe is of the opinion that there is nothing<br />\nintrinsically wrong with hippies(whoever<br />\nthey are) and that they should be allowed<br />\nto \"stay with their own thing.\" On the<br />\nother hand, he wryly and perhaps incorrectly feels that the campus Nietzsche of<br />\ntoday is the mill grinder of tomorrow, a<br />\nquote borrowed from H.L. Mencken.<br />\nWell then, you ask, where did this<br />\ndude come from? Just a little over fifty<br />\nyears ago, Harley Brinsfield was a downhome, Eastern Shore country boy. It<br />\nwas there, down on the proverbial farm,<br />\nthat Harley Brinsfield became aware of<br />\nthat mysterious, powerful, plaintive,<br />\nroot-american art form ---the blues.<br />\nThe young boy started listening to the<br />\nblacks in his immediate environment sing<br />\nand play gospel and blues music. From<br />\nhere the step to modern jazz and dixieland, though a long one, is almost inevitable for a white man.<br />\nThis sustained interest has enabled<br />\nMr. Brinsfield to become, in effect, the<br />\nnumber one jazz fan in the country. Mr.<br />\nBrinsfield is no frustrated musician,<br />\neither, like so many other critics and<br />\nbuffs. He claims that his only musical<br />\nendeavor was drumming in the boy scout<br />\nban, an avocation that didn't last long.<br />\nBut his appreciation for the black man's<br />\nmusic that became jazz has never left<br />\nhim.<br />\nTime passed, as it is wont to do, and<br />\nsoon we find Harley in the Coast Guard,<br />\nwhere overseas he discovered the submarine sandwich. These unique mother<br />\nbruisers fascinated him as much as jazz<br />\nmusic did, for he has parlayed the little<br />\nbuggers into a comfortable living by<br />\nselling them. After being discharged<br />\nfrom the service, Harley and his wife<br />\nset up the first sub shop in the city, down<br />\nin the old Lexington Market. Now, it is<br />\ndifficult to drive anywhere in the city<br />\nwithout being constantly tempted by the<br />\nidea of sticking your mouth around a<br />\nHarleyburger.<br />\nIn due time, Mr. Brinsfield became a<br />\nprominent man in the affairs ofthe city<br />\nas previously mentioned as well as keeping close tabs on the smoky world of jazz.<br />\nAs far as Harley is concerned, keeping<br />\n\u2022,<br />\n(continued on page 7),<br /><br />\nFeb. 27, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nfeatures\u2014mm<br /><br />\nDo It, Jimmy!Scoop Me! Houp-lal<br />\nBy JIMMY OLSENBERG<br />\nMy closest brush with journalistic<br />\nglory came when I was luckily chosen to<br />\ndrive the radio car for the New York<br />\nDaily News photographers who were covering a peace demonstration. The News,<br />\nof course, tries to make every demonstration seem as small and violent as<br />\nPossible. For example, during the Chicago police riots in 1968, their photographers were specifically instructed to<br />\nget shots of vicious hippies provoking<br />\nChicago's Finest. Anyway, for this demonstration, the News chose, among<br />\nothers, ace photographer Mel Finkelstein, who had the misfortune of being<br />\njudoed into submission by the otherwise<br />\namiable Mrs. Onassis.<br />\nAs I was driving these old pros to the<br />\nrally at Central Park, one of the photographers turned to me, and earnestly<br />\nsaid, \"You know, maybe they do believe<br />\nwhat they're hollering about. But when<br />\nthey don't take a bath, for Chrissake,<br />\nhow the hell can you believe them?\"<br />\nGrabbing me by the shoulder, he continued, \"Just tell me this, buddy: Why<br />\ncan't they be clean like other people? Why<br />\ndon't they ever take a bath? I don't understand it!\" In the back seat, Mel said,<br />\n\"Yeah. But some of those hippie broads<br />\naren't so bad-looking, you know what I<br />\nmean? They don't wear any bras, and<br />\nso when they walk around you can see<br />\ntheir boobs shaking. Some of those<br />\nbroads got a good pair of knockers on<br />\nthem.\"<br /><br />\nMy Big Chance<br />\nAfter dropping them off at the park,<br />\nI had to wait outside in case they had to<br />\nradio in anything from their walkie-talkies. As I was waiting in the car, a pack<br />\nof demonstrators came hurtling out of the<br />\npark, and ran screaming down one of the<br />\nside streets. I realized; here was my big<br />\nchance!<br />\nA story was breaking before my very<br />\neyes, and by radioing in the information<br />\nI could give the News a dramatic scoop.<br />\nYes, I could see it now! I would return<br />\nto the city room fatigued, but happy.<br />\nEveryone would stop their work,and gaze<br />\nin, silent awe as I casually walked past the<br />\nrows of desks. Then, first one reporter,<br />\nthen another, and still another, would<br />\nrush up to me, pat me on the back, and<br />\nexclaim, \"Great job, Jimmy! You're<br />\none hell of a reporter!\" I, of course,<br />\nwould humbly accept all their compliments, and in my best Gary Cooper<br />\nfashion, I'd say, \"Shucks, fellas, it was<br /><br />\nOMAA FAVOR PAL.

Police Brutality! Another Chicago!<br />\nGrabbing the<br />\nradio mike, I pressed down the button<br />\non the mike, and began screamingfrantically,\"This is car 72 here, can you read<br />\nme? Car 72 here, can you read me?\"<br />\nBroderick Crawford would have been<br />\nproud. I continued, getting desparate because I was geeting no answer from the<br />\noffice. \"The cops...they're chasing the<br />\ndemonstrators down this street! They're<br />\nrunning down the street, and the cops...<br />\nthe cops...are trying to get them! It's<br />\nincredible! Wait a minute, there's some<br />\nmore demonstrators...and...and\u2014some<br />\nmore cops! Oh my God! I can't believe it!\"<br />\nBy now, I had completely lost control<br />\nof myself, my face was contorted with<br />\nrage. Actually, nobody was being brutalized, but it looked like it, so I kept shouting, \"Car 72 here. Can you read me? Can<br />\nyou read me?\" All the while I kept wondering why theywouldn't answer me. Was<br />\nit a fascist conspiracy to repress the<br />\ntruth? After raving for at least another<br />\nten minutes, I let the mike slip out of my<br />\nhand, and leaned back into the driver's<br />\nseat in limp exhaustion. I had done my<br />\nduty and I closed my eyes as images of<br />\nPulitzer Prizes filtered through my<br />\nmind.<br /><br />\nGood Night, Jimmy<br />\nSuddenly there came from the radio<br />\na harsh static sound. At last, my heroics were being recognized. Expectantly,<br />\nI leaned forward. \"Listen, Car 72, you<br />\nschmuck!\" Yes, I thought, the truth hurts<br />\nthem too much and so they take it out<br />\non me. The voice continued, \"We've<br />\nheard you for twenty minutes, you moron,<br />\nbut you forgot to take yout finger off the<br />\nbutton on the mike so we could answer<br />\nyou.\" With a queasy feeling in my stomach, I signed off. And then, allover the<br />\ncity, the other News radio cars said in<br />\nUnison, \"Good night, Chet!\" For days<br />\nafterward, I sheepishly had to endure remarks sarcastically saying, \"Great job,<br />\nJimmy! You're one hell of a reporter!\"<br />\nWhat the News is most famous for,<br />\nthough, is its lurid emphasis on sex and<br />\nviolence. While attacking pornography in<br />\nits editorials, it was not reluctant to show<br />\non page 3 some young starlet, newly arrived at Kennedy airport, sitting atop her<br />\nluggage, with her mini-skirt riding up to<br />\nher crotch.

The<br />\nKennedy accident over the summer is a<br />\ngood example of this. At the Times,when<br />\nthe story first came in over thewire,the<br />\ncopy editor must have said something<br />\nlike, \"Senator Kennedy will probably be<br />\nfaced with the necessity of reappraising<br />\nhis Presidential aspirations due to this<br />\nunfortunate accident. However, we must<br />\nnot be too hasty in our judgments.\" At<br />\nthe News, it was somewhat different.Sitting as the head copy editor, surrounded<br />\nby a horse-shoe copy desk, was a thin,<br />\nirritable old man, whose left hand was<br />\nhorribly palsied.

The grisly lead paragraph, in the usual sensationalist fashion,<br />\nwas in extra-large dark type, and of<br />\ncourse it went into intricate detail on the<br />\nexact nature of the burns. Filtered<br />\nthrough the rest of the issue were some<br />\nmore brutalities, including one childbeating, three rapes, and at least four<br />\nhit-and-run accidents.

The liberals, aligning themselves with the immediate integration position of the Supreme Court, may be on the verge of a<br />\npyrrhic victory.<br />\nLast week's White<br />\nHouse dismissal of<br />\nliberal<br />\ncivil rights<br />\nchief<br />\nLeon Panetta<br />\nNEWS<br />\nsignalled what Time<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\nmagazine had called<br />\nthe end of the Second<br />\nReconstruction.<br />\nBut there remains a glimmer of confused hope here in Maryland with the<br />\nfederal rejection of the state's plans<br />\nfor integrating public colleges.<br />\nThe sixty day deadline for submission<br />\nof a new plan was waived by HEW last<br />\nweek while Panetta was being wedged out<br /><br />\nMr. Leon Panetta, HEW civil rights chief,<br />\nwas forced out of office last week by the<br />\nWhite House for his pursuit of an immediateintegration policy.<br /><br />\nof a job. At the same time, it was learned from Maryland Secretary of State<br />\nBlaire Lee that HEW had not actually<br />\n\"rejected\" the state's integration proposals. It had merely found them \"not<br />\nacceptable.\"<br />\nLack of a Theme<br />\nThe confusion lies in the yaeueries of<br />\nHEW's \"non-acceptance\" order and the<br />\nlack oi a definable temporal theme behind it.<br />\nRegional civil rights chief Eloise Severinson rejected the state's plan because<br />\nit \"suffers from certain limitations.\"<br />\nMore specifically, the plan failed to meet<br />\nHEW guidelines (suggestions) in at least<br />\nfour areas. The lack of proposed programs for phasing out degenerating insitutions such as Coppin State, merging<br />\nothers, creating specific attendance<br />\nzones and instituting domains of academic specialization for each of<br />\nthe<br />\nstate's colleges.<br />\nHEW further ciriticized the state's<br /><br />\nplans contending that, although their implementation would brine. about greater<br />\nnumerical integration, they would not address the problem oi overcomii* the<br />\nstrong historic racial identification of<br />\neach of the state's colleges. The University of Maryland at College Park,<br />\nfor example is 99 per cent white,whereas its Princess Anne County branch is<br />\n92 per cent black.<br />\nThe original desegregation order was<br />\nhanded down from HEW last March,with<br />\na 90 day deadline for the submission of<br />\nan outline. Then came a 120 day deadline for submission of a formal plan,<br />\nwhich was submitted on time, October<br />\n1.<br />\nEach of the state's colleges workedon<br />\nits own plan, which it then submitted to<br />\nthe state college board of trustees for<br />\nconsolidation and approval.<br /><br />\nBlacks Hit Racism in High Schools<br />\nThe recent disturbances in the Baltimore public schools were the result of<br />\ngrievances that have been simmering for<br />\nmany months.<br />\nTo Baltimore's black high school students, one of the major sources of discontent is what they feel is the racism<br />\nof many of the older white teachers in<br />\nthe school system.<br />\nAt the all-girl Eastern High School,<br />\na group of predominantly middle-class<br />\nblacks, known as Black Voice, had been<br />\npetitioning the principal since October<br />\nover what they charged was the racism<br />\nof Dorothy Schepler, a 40-year veteran<br />\nof the school system. They had gotten<br />\nno response and on February 12 they<br />\ntried to confront Schepler with their<br />\ncharges.<br />\nA crowd gathered and eventually the<br />\npolice were called in. Eleven students<br />\nwere arrested and, according to some<br />\nstudents, the police were brutal in dispersing the crowd and at the police station. Some girls went over to the allboy City College High School and some<br />\nCity students tried to,cross Loch Raven<br />\nBoulevard to get to Eastern, but they<br />\nwere met by police. When students<br />\nstoned a bus, tear gas grenades were<br />\nshot off and both schools were dis-<br /><br />\nmissed.<br />\nDuring the following week (February<br />\n16-20), there were protests -- and<br />\narrests -- at Forest Park High School,<br />\nthe Department of Education, War Memorial Plaza, City Hall Plaza, and at<br />\nBaltimore Polytechnic Institute (Poly).<br />\nThere was also some boycotting of<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThe major protest was at Poly on<br />\nFebruary 18, where 150 students barricaded themselves in the cafeteria, and<br />\n95 students who refused to leave were<br />\narrested.<br />\nAlso, during that week, the President of the School Board, Francis D.<br />\nMurnaghan, resigned because a majority<br />\nof the School Board wanted to launch<br />\ntheir own investigation of the school<br />\ndisturbances.<br />\nSince then, the Board<br />\nhas appointed a four-man inquiry panel<br />\nchaired by Percy Williams of the Maryland Department of Education. And the<br />\nCity Council has approved D'Alessandro's appointment of Robert L. Karwacki as President of the School Board.<br />\nOn Wednesday, February 18, major<br />\ngovernment and education officials met<br />\nwith students and parents at Poly. At<br />\nthat meeting, the newly-formed Central<br />\nCommittee, representing mostly middle-<br /><br />\nSTEER N' BEER<br /><br />\nBesides ideological conflicts which are<br />\nnot easy to ignore, the main problems<br />\nfacing Maryland colleges trying to meet<br />\nHEW guidelines are financial. At a time<br />\nwhen public funds for higher education<br />\nare tight, Maryland colleges are being<br />\nasked to radically restructure their entire operations,- including revamping the<br />\nacademic offerings of each college to<br />\nmake each a specialist in one field.<br />\nWith the doubltful status of HEW aidto-education funds, and the revocation<br />\nof a compliance deadline for Maryland<br />\nthe problem of evaluating the effects of<br />\nNixon's ilelaying tactics becomes much<br />\nless of a problem.<br />\nIt appears that HEW Secretary Finch<br />\nand his liberal allies, among whom were<br />\nMr. Panetta, are on the losing end of a<br />\npower struggle that has resulted in the<br />\nsuccessful allignment of Administration<br />\nconservatives and Maryland officials<br />\nplagued by an old disease known to laymen as the integration-avoidance syndrome.<br /><br />\nWALES * ENGLAND * HAITI * AUSTRIA * COLOMBIA * MEXICO<br /><br />\nMENU<br /><br />\nIRELAND *<br /><br />\nGodfrey's<br /><br />\nclass black students from Eastern City,<br />\nForest Park, and Northwestern high<br />\nschools, presented their demands.<br />\nThere have been almost no protests<br />\nat the overwhelmingly lower-class black<br />\nschools of Dunbar, Carver and Douglass. The Central Committee demands<br />\nIncluded: amnesty for students, indicting the police involved in the Eastern<br />\nincident, getting rid of all racists in<br />\nthe schools, an investigative committee to examine racism in the schools,<br />\nand black studies courses.<br />\nSince then, the School Board has<br />\ngranted academic amnesty and D'Alessandro is putting pressure on State's<br />\nAttorney Charles Moylan to drop all<br />\ncharges. The black students have ended their boycott, but are formulating<br />\nnew demands. They are waiting for<br />\nthe report, 30 days from now, of the<br />\nInquiry panel.<br />\nIn addition, Superintendent Sheldon has set up grievance<br />\ncommittees in each one of the high<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe crisis in the Baltimore schools,<br />\nthough, is far from over. The basic<br />\ncauses of discontent still remain: a<br />\nlack of black studies courses, a lack<br />\nof real student power and teachers<br />\nthat many feel are racist.<br /><br />\nTowson State College President James<br />\nFisher was surprised by the HEW action<br />\nin rejecting the state college proposals.<br />\n\"We had every reason to believe this<br />\nmost recent proposal Was going to be<br />\naccepted,\" he said.<br /><br />\n;s2e slot ca/ne/46<br /><br />\n2.50<br /><br />\nSUBS<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nPIZZA<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nSPAGHETTI<br />\nHOME MADE<br />\nCHICKEN<br />\nWITH FRENCH<br />\nFRIES AND ENGLISH MUFFIN.<br />\n4<br /><br />\n444i.<br />\n2.75<br /><br />\n.7(<br />\na_<br />\nCl)<br /><br />\nCD<br /><br />\n&gt;-<br /><br />\nTh.
