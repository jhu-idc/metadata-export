He also stated that<br />\nthe IFC is contemplating changes<br />\nin -the rush system.<br />\nOther reasons, however, can<br />\naccount for the number of fraternity men on campus and the<br />\neclipse, if such is the case, of the<br />\nsystem. First, Hopkins is unique<br />\namong schools with fraternities in<br />\nthat Hopkins is all male, which<br />\ngives rise to certain social problems and the need for an outlet.<br />\nLack of a student union and the<br />\nfact that there is \"little for an<br />\nindependent to do\" are also cited<br />\nas reasons for the siie of the frats.<br />\nOf far more interest is the<br />\ncontention that, with the \"new<br />\nbreed\" of students i.e. the \"new<br />\nleft,\" the fraternities are becoming increasingly irrelevant, an anachronism of the raccoon coat<br />\nera. To this the fraternity would<br />\ncontend that activity oriented<br />\npeople are not excluded and it is<br />\ntrue that one sees a preponderence of frat men in such acceptable outlets at the student council<br />\nbut few in SDS.<br />\nFraternities are seen by the<br />\nSDS or activist type student as<br />\nanti-intellectual dens of beer<br />\ndrinking slobs interested only in<br />\nwenching and lacrosse. Whether or<br />\nnot this is the case, the fact<br />\nremains that the fraternities have<br />\ndone little (with no success) to<br />\n<br />\nattract this genre of student.<br />\nThe IFC president contends<br />\nthat it would be \"ludicrous for<br />\nthe fraternity system to have<br />\ntoken involvement\" and that he<br />\nquestions the \"place of middle\u2014<br />\nclass students\" in such involvement.

It is,<br />\nand for some time has been, argued that fraternities, because of<br />\ntheir voluntary exclusiveness,<br />\ntheir hedonism, and their constitutional disinterest in extra-fraternity social problems are almost by<br />\ndefinition inimical to the goals of<br />\nhigher education, whatever that<br />\nphrase may mean.<br />\nFraternities have thus become<br />\nidentified in the popular mind, if<br />\nthere is one, with the forces of<br />\nreaction, with what now seems<br />\nthe anachronistic practices of<br />\nwithdrawal from the world outside the fraternity and an emphasis instead upon such non-existent<br />\ninanities as Spirit and Brotherhood.<br />\nThe fraternity man, once again<br />\nin his popular image, has become<br />\nsomething dehumanized - - a portable (sometimes) flask, an ambulatory pin and chain, a talking<br />\nhandshake, a tin grin, a being<br />\napart from others who spends his<br />\nfew waking hours alternately plotting how to keep the riff-raff out<br />\nof his hermetically sealed world<br />\nand concocting barrels of booze in<br />\norder to innoculate himself<br />\nagainst the perils of involement<br />\nwith whatever it is that exists out<br />\nthere beyond the lacrosse field.<br />\nAlter Charters<br />\nI would not claim that this<br />\nimage, if it does in fact exist in<br />\nthe minds of some, is totally<br />\ninaccurate. Some of the membership policies of today's social fraternities, for example, are an outrage and a disgrace; here at Hopkins the administration has been<br />\nshockingly negligent in enforcing<br />\nfair membership practices on the<br />\npart of fraternities. Why, I wonder, doesn't the national S.D.S.<br />\nturn its attention to this aspect of<br />\ncampus inequity and away from<br />\nthe rather nebulous problem of<br />\nstudent involvement in administrative functions?<br />\nNo social organization whose<br />\nmembership qualifications might<br />\nhave been those of Pre-Cambrian<br />\nAlabama should be allowed to<br />\nexist on this or any other college<br />\n<br />\ncampus. In recent years many<br />\ncollege administrations have forced discrimination fraternities<br />\neither to alter their charters or to<br />\nget out, and the administration<br />\nhere should do the same, whether<br />\nor not it offends some medieval<br />\nalumnae.<br />\nVegetative Mediocrity<br />\nIt is also quite true that frater-nities, which are indeed social<br />\norganizations, put the pursuit of<br />\npleasure rather high among their<br />\npriorities. It therefore also follows<br />\nthat they breed a certain insensitivity in their members as far as<br />\ncommunity involvement is concerned. The problems of war and<br />\npeace are often obliterated by<br />\nintramural tennis. And in such a<br />\nway it is quite obviously true that<br />\nfraternities are sometimes inimical<br />\nto whatever goals higher education may have.<br />\nThey may prevent members<br />\nfrom getting to know many different sorts of people rather than the<br />\nreverse; they idolize pleasure and<br />\nnon-involvement, as I have said;<br />\nand so inevitably they will come<br />\ninto conflict with many an individual's intellectual curiosity or seriousness of purpose - - any purpose.<br />\nIt is not good fraternal form,<br />\nfor example, to be intense about<br />\nanything, to be committed to<br />\nanything, to stand out in any way<br />\nfrom the vegetative mediocrity of<br />\nthe middle. One puts on a tie to<br />\nattend a non-compulsory lecture<br />\nand is ridiculed; this is the essence<br />\nof what I am talking about. The<br />\nslow erosion of innocent enthusiasm is accelerated by the fraternity, and all it has to replace<br />\nwhat's gone is cynicism (which<br />\nhas no surpassed the clap as the<br />\nmost virulent undergraduate disease).<br />\nNot Apologist<br />\nWhat I have said so far is part<br />\npopular fancy and part truth; in<br />\nsome fraternities the atrocities I<br />\nhave dredged up are matters of<br />\nfact, while in others they are<br />\nnon-existent. The fraternities,<br />\nhere and elsewhere, are as different as their members. No two<br />\npeople are exactly the same, and<br />\nfraternities are after all only the<br />\nsums of their individual parts.<br />\nI would say in the defense of<br />\nfraternities that I do think they<br />\nare often kicked around unfairly - for even though many of the<br />\npopular criticisms of fraternities<br />\nare indeed valid and proper, they<br />\noverlook a great deal.

The discussion, concerning the governmental<br />\npolicies of South Africa, was conducted by Dr. P.G.J. Koornhof,<br />\nDeputy Minister of Education,<br />\nwho spoke on Human Relations,<br />\nMr. S.J.M. Steyn, deputy leader of<br />\nthe United (Opposition) Party,<br />\nwho spoke on the attitudes of the<br />\nminority party, and Dr. P.S. van<br />\nder Merwe of the Nationalist Party who spoke on South-West<br />\nAFrica and its future.<br />\nOver 200 people attended the<br />\nlecture, many of them decidly<br />\nunfriendly towards the South<br />\nAfrican government. Prior to the<br />\nspeech, nearly 50 people picketed<br />\nShriver Hall to protest the governme- policies. As one protestor<br />\nexp\u2014med,\"We do not deny them<br />\nthe right to speak, we are simply<br />\nprotesting their right to suppress<br />\nthe black of South Africa.\"<br />\nAfter the picketing, a rally was<br />\nheld on the steps of Shriver to<br />\ninform those present of \"the true<br />\nstate of affairs in South Africa.\"<br />\nDr. David Cohen, professor of<br />\nAfrican History at Hopkins, spoke<br />\non \"South African Atrocities\" at<br />\nthe rally. The rally was organized<br />\nby the SDS to demonstrate that<br />\n\"Americans do not approve of the<br />\nSouth African policies, despite the<br />\nU.S. government's support of the<br />\nregime.\"<br />\nAfter the rally, the protestors<br />\nmoved into the Clipper Room,<br />\nwhere the symposium was being<br />\nheld, in order to hear the South<br />\nAfricans speak. Many carried signs<br />\ninto the room protesting the ra-<br />\n<br />\ncism of South Africa.<br />\nThe speeches were frequently<br />\ninterrupted by jeers and differences of opinion, but the speeches,<br />\non the whole, were allowed to<br />\nproceed without major disruption.<br />\nAfter the speeches, however,<br />\nthe floor was thrown open to<br />\nquestions, and the verbal pyrotechnics started. A South African<br />\nblack, currently attending school<br />\nin the United States, presented hi<br />\nown view point on the racial<br />\nsituation and replied to \"many of<br />\nthe lies\" told by the South African visitors. He questioned Dr.<br />\nKoornhof's description of South<br />\nAfrica as \"a miracle in race relations, a Christian and a happy<br />\ncountry.\"<br />\nAt one point, Manuel Rodriguez, the moderator, attempted to<br />\nend the meeting, but was forced<br />\nto let it continue when those<br />\npresent angrily demanded to \"Let<br />\nus finish.\" He was eventually forced to end the meeting to allow<br />\nthe Africans to meet prior commitments. Enough questions and<br />\nanswers were fired back and forth,<br />\nbefore they were forced to leave,<br />\nto produce angry and enlightening<br />\nreplies on both sides.<br />\nDean Rudoy, the executive<br />\nsecretary, commented that he was<br />\npleased with the meeting, as a<br />\n\"very vital and dynamic dialogue<br />\ndeveloped, and the purpose of the<br />\nInternational Forum is to provide<br />\nand induce a dialogue within the<br />\nHopkins community.\" Rodriguez<br />\ncommented that \"I think we all<br />\nlearned something. Or if we didn't<br />\nlearn anything, at least some questions should have developed,<br />\nwhich will lead to knowledge.\"<br />\nMr. Stem of the South African Mission, speaking of the heckling and the animated arguments<br />\nthat were directed at him, maintained, \"We spoke the absolute<br />\ntruth to these people here tonight.<br />\nIt is for them to accept or reject<br />\nit.\"<br />\nTONIGHT<br />\n<br />\nvii\u2018ok<br />\n<br />\n14.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTHE TWO OF US<br />\nthcAndtli<br />\nThe Vlaphoust25th at Charles<br />\n<br />\nVI<br />\n<br />\nat 2.4,6,8.10 [Ms - 04301<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nFIR I CIAV oct.<br />\n4, 'In<br />\n<br />\ngrad<br />\n<br />\nclub<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nmust be sought by joining with<br />\n\"Through these and other meaothers in efforts of a broader sures, worked out in ample conscope.

Hopkins, through its<br />\nprograms of government research and through<br />\nthe status which it accords the ROTC program,<br />\nhas committed itself to the questionabe goals<br />\nof our national \"defense\" effort,(\"defense,\"it<br />\nis well to remember, being a very dubious, very<br />\nNewspeak term).<br />\nWe are not trying to inject a moral issue<br />\nhere, for admittedly, morality is an elusive and<br />\npossibly moot question. However, those who<br />\nare concerned about the University must confront the question of the ideals upon which a<br />\nuniversity is founded, and the role in society<br />\nwhich a university must play.<br />\nThe University is a unique institution which<br />\nholds the crucial position of being able to freely<br />\nand independently offer its critiques and innovations to society - - and its reputation as the<br />\n\"cutting edge\" of society is maintained by its<br />\nefforts to remain as an impartial observer. This<br />\nstatus allows the University to protect its<br />\nscholars from outside pressures by avoiding the<br />\nestablishment of inflexible commitments to any<br />\nfaction or any set of policies. The University's<br />\nnon-partisan nature, as an institution, is crucial<br />\nto its progress.<br />\nYet, the University's present commitment to<br />\nthe military objectives of our government<br />\nthreaten to undercut this stance. Though it<br />\nwould be unthinkable for Hopkins, as an<br />\ninstitution, to \"take sides\" on the issue of<br />\nVietnam, those who supported the continuance<br />\nof University military research grants in the<br />\nHouse Armed Services Committee (1968)<br />\nstated that such research is crucial to our war<br />\neffort in Vietnam.<br />\nMoreover, a substantial number of the officers now serving in the military services come<br />\nfrom college ROTC programs. The University<br />\nhas chosen to side with the armed services by<br />\nmaking ROTC enrollment particularly alluring - the Army supplies scholarships and draft<br />\ndeferments, while the University awards \"student-soldiers\" academic credit to be figured in<br />\ntheir grade-point average, (though such credit<br />\ndoes not count towards the B.A. requirements).<br />\nBy these actions, Hopkins has chosen to<br />\nalign itself with certain military objectives, and<br />\nit must be remembered that these military<br />\nobjectives have been an integral part of our<br />\nforeign policy objectives. The Institution of<br />\nHopkins has indeed chosen sides; and, by doing<br />\nso, has compromised the independence of the<br />\nUniversity and its scholars.<br />\nAn equally important question concerns<br />\nese decisions and commitments were<br />\nha<br />\nm what we have been able to learn,<br />\nma<br />\nthe majority of such commitments were made<br />\nby a handful of faculty and administration<br />\nmembers.<br />\n<br />\nBruce Drake<br />\n<br />\nDavid Cooper<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,OCT 18, 1968<br />\n<br />\nDennis Estis<br />\n<br />\nJames Franke<br />\n<br />\nthese committees). Considering the importance<br />\nof the University in society, we feel that such<br />\nmethods are gravely wanting. We wonder how<br />\nlong crucial issues which affect our University<br />\nwill be decided in this manner.<br />\nSpecifically, we question the status which<br />\nthe University has afforded the ROTC program,<br />\nand we question the policies which Hopkins<br />\npresently holds in relation to \"defense\" research.<br />\nWe don't dispute the right of ROTC to exist<br />\non campus. However, we do dispute the contention that it deserves higher status than any<br />\ncampus extra-curricular activity, and we dispute<br />\nthe argument that its present status at a private<br />\nuniversity is in the \"national interest.\" We<br />\nquestion the terms of the contract upon which<br />\nHopkins agreed to institute the ROTC program<br />\nat Homewood; namely, that its instructors<br />\nautomatically are elevated to a faculty rank,<br />\nthat its courses be placed on a near-equal basis<br />\nwith the \"civilian\" curriculum and that the<br />\nUniversity has little or no control over subject<br />\nmatter. We contend that the principle of \"free<br />\ninquiry\" is violated by the fact that students<br />\ncannot audit a military science course without<br />\nenrolling in ROTC. We oppose the awarding of<br />\nacademic credit in any form to ROTC students.<br />\nConcerning the question of \"defense\" research: we do not doubt that it has a place in<br />\nthe University. However, we do question certain aspects of our commitment to \"defense\"<br />\nprojects and we are concerned with the wider<br />\nimplications which they entail.<br />\nTherefore, we call on the Academic Council<br />\nand the Student Council, groups supposedly<br />\nrepresentative of the faculty and students, to<br />\nundertake the following steps independently of<br />\nthe University administration:<br />\n1. To establish a committee to operate<br />\nindependently from both groups to begin an<br />\nimmediate investigation and series of hearing<br />\nconcerning the status of ROTC at the University. This committee would present its findings<br />\nand recommendations to the Administration.<br />\n2. To establish another committee, also<br />\noperating independently, to assess the role of<br />\nHopkins in \"defense\" research and to hold<br />\nhearings to sound out viewpoints of Hopkins<br />\nstudents, faculty, administration and research<br />\npersonnel. This committee would also report its<br />\nfindings and recommendations to the University.<br />\nWe do not plan to let these issues die in the<br />\nusual Hopkins tradition. We also urge those<br />\nindividuals and groups who are concerned<br />\nabout the issues raised here to pressure the<br />\nStudent and Academic Councils to act in these<br />\nareas. For too long these groups have been the<br />\nlast to address the issues, when they should<br />\nhave been first.<br />\n<br />\nPostscript<br />\nIt is not irrelevant here to point out the ill<br />\neffects of \"defense\" work on the mental<br />\nprocesses. It seems that prolonged contact with<br />\nsuch research adversely affects one's memory.<br />\nCases in point are<br />\nofficials at Hopkins,<br />\nBruce Partridge, and<br />\nheads the Institute for<br />\n<br />\ncertain Administrative<br />\nnotably Vice-President<br />\nBenjamin Willis (who<br />\nCooperative Research).<br />\n<br />\nLast year there was reportedly a faculty<br />\ncommittee, including some students, who reviewed the ROTC program and effected the<br />\nsuggestion to discontinue the counting of<br />\nROTC credits towards the PA. degee. There<br />\nwas also a University committee which hammered out a statement of Hopkins policy<br />\ntowards government research.<br />\n<br />\nWhen questioned by the News-Letter for<br />\nthe story which appeared in last week's issue,<br />\nboth men denied that Hopkins did any research<br />\nin connection with Fort Detrick at the present<br />\ntime. Fort Detrick is one of the largest chemical<br />\nand biological warfare research centers in the<br />\nworld.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, we feel that neither of these<br />\ncommittees did a comprehensive, honest, or<br />\nthorough job. Moreover, they were conducted,<br />\nfor the most part, without the participation of<br />\nconcerned elements in the Hopkins community<br />\n(in fact, few people knew of the existence of<br />\n<br />\nHowever, when Mr. Willis was prompted<br />\nwith certain facts during the past week, his<br />\npartial amnesia was overcome, and he remembered that yes indeed, Hopkins is presently<br />\nlinked to the work at Fort Detrick.<br />\nStrange. Strange.<br />\n<br />\nLEAVE GEORGE ALONE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the<br />\nNews-Letter's definitive rebuttal<br />\nof George Corley Wallace should<br />\nbe such a squidlike ink of<br />\nundisciplined rhetoric and<br />\ndirectionless thought. The content<br />\nof the News-Letter is supposedly<br />\ndirected at an audience of better<br />\nthan average intellectual capacity,<br />\nand if such be the case, let us<br />\nforego such paralogistic spasms,<br />\neven in so noble a cause as<br />\nopposition to G.C. His intellectual<br />\ndefeat certainly does not require<br />\nit. His mini-thoughts are too easily<br />\ndestroyed by an application of<br />\ndetached reason. Rationality<br />\nvanquishes bomb-like bursts of<br />\ndirelict emotion. Responses<br />\ncontaining more of the same<br />\nsimply make losers of all<br />\nparticipants.<br />\nMost offensive, perhaps, is<br />\nLevine's unrelenting tone of<br />\nincrediable arrogance. He is the<br />\nself-appointed Interpreter and<br />\nGuardian of All Quintessential<br />\nTruths, with the derivative<br />\nfunction, Supreme Arbiter of<br />\nValue Judgements. But must he<br />\nbe so sloppy? Hatred, Nazism,<br />\npromiscuity, and (God save<br />\nAmerica) unsophistication \u2014all<br />\nfunneled into the Baltimore<br />\nlaborer via association with G'C..<br />\nPresumptuous elisions abound like<br />\nmetaphors in a Mailer novel.<br />\nSocial and intellectual histories<br />\nare revealed by the stringiness of a<br />\ngirl's hair. \"The average<br />\nAmerican\" is the drunken,<br />\ntable-pounding racist by<br />\ndefinition.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that Mr.<br />\nLevine seems to write for the<br />\npeople he has \"learned to fear and<br />\ndespise since he was a child\". But<br />\nthen his analyses are in perfect<br />\nharmony with his prose. One can<br />\nonly pity the \"commie-faggot<br />\nconspiracy\" which he has believed<br />\nin for the last five or six years.<br />\n<br />\nWhy does it matter that, in the<br />\nopinion of Mr. Levine, the Wallace<br />\nworkers were \"decidedly unattractive, with their cheap round-collared white shirts and blue<br />\nshirts?\" I dare say most of the<br />\nsupporters of Robert Kennedy,<br />\nEugene McCarthy, Richard Nixon<br />\nand Hubert Humphrey were decidedly unattractive, and some even<br />\nhad \"stringy blonde hair ,\" as horrible as that may seem!!! May I<br />\nalso ask Mr. Levine where he<br />\nobtained his information that the<br />\nWallace workers are \"the girls who<br />\nare the outsiders, the hangers-on<br />\nof school social life. They sit in<br />\nthe back of high school history<br />\nclasses unnoticed by the rest of<br />\nthe students. They struggle for C's<br />\nin school . . .\"I imagine that he<br />\nheld a poll of these people. Surely<br />\nhe would not make these emotional appeals to bias and self\u2014<br />\nesteem without some basis in<br />\nfact?!<br />\nIt would take an article twice<br />\nas long as the original to fully<br />\ncondemn by direct analysis the<br />\nabsurdity of the statements made<br />\nby Art Levine.

Our Freshman Orientation Week was a beginning in this<br />\ndirection and we hope this symposium and future ones will increase the intellectual involvement<br />\nhere. Right now there is very<br />\nlittle.\"<br />\nApathy Reigns<br />\nThis lack of intellectual stimulation is due, the two seniors<br />\nbelieve, to a sense of apathy on<br />\nthe part of many Hopkins students. The Orientation Committee<br />\nattempted to create an atmosphere earlier this year for creative<br />\nthinking through its orientation of<br />\nthe freshman class. But they see<br />\nthe need of intellectual expansion<br />\nin all the classes.<br />\nTherefore, the Committee discarded their original idea of holding symposia only for freshmen,<br />\nand have opened them to all<br />\nstudents. Aggression was picked<br />\nbecause, in Jacob's words, \"it is a<br />\nbroad topic of immediate importance to our present affairs.\"<br />\nJacobs and Treem hope to<br />\nplace the lectures on a permanent<br />\nbasis if there is enough student<br />\nparticipation. Treem stated, \"We<br />\nare not really interested in the<br />\nquantity of participation, but<br />\nmore the quality and enthusiasm<br />\nof a small group.\" The format of<br />\nthe 8 p.m. programs at Levering<br />\nconsists of a 45 minute lecture by<br />\nan expert in the topic for the<br />\nnight followed by audience questions and discussion.<br />\nSouthwick Speaks<br />\nDr. Charles H. Southwick, a<br />\nHopkins Professor of Pathobiology, began the lectures last Sunday.<br />\nHe spoke on the biological bases<br />\nin animals and humans for aggression. Before an audience of about<br />\n60, Southwick related the two<br />\ndominant theories on animal aggression.<br />\nThe instinction hypothesis was<br />\nforwarded by Conrad Lorenz in<br />\nhis well-known book On Aggression. Lorenz, Dr. Southwick explained, believes that in all animals, including man, lay innate<br />\naggressive drives. These drives express themselves when one animal<br />\n' attacks another of the same specie.<br />\nJ.P. Scott, author of Aggression, is the leader of the environmentalist school. These biologists contend that man and animals become aggressive due to<br />\nenvironmental conditions such as<br />\nisolation, education, competition,<br />\netc. Dr. Southwich favored this<br />\ntheory.<br />\nThe Hopkins pathobiologist<br />\nsaid that most animal aggression is<br />\nconstructive and rarely leads to<br />\ninjury or death. \"The fight to the<br />\ndeath\" among similar specie,<br />\nSouthwick stated, is uncommon<br />\nin the animal world.<br />\nThree Areas<br />\nDr. Southwick saw three areas<br />\nwhere fatal aggression occurs. Unusual enviornmental conditions<br />\nsuch as captivity or isolation will<br />\nlead to an aggressive animal behavior. Also, fighting will result<br />\nwhen two social groups of a specie<br />\ncome into direct contact.<br />\nIn most animals, he explained,<br />\nthere is a great feeling towards<br />\ncolony and territorial recognition.<br />\nWhen any other of the same genus<br />\nencroaches upon another group,<br />\nthe death of the first will normally result. Social disorganization is<br />\nthe third area in which aggressive<br />\nbehavior materializes, according<br />\nto Southwick. Many times, this<br />\ndisorganization is caused by a high<br />\npcipulation density.<br />\nSlides were shown of a number<br />\nof experiments with mice. The<br />\nevidence seemed contradictory at<br />\ntimes and inconclusive, and Dr.<br />\n<br />\nIn answer to a special plea<br />\nevitably cause an aggressive behaMayor D'Alesandro the Stufrom<br />\nvior.<br />\ndent Association is organizing students to hand out literature in<br />\nWhat A Strain<br />\nfavor of the city school bond<br />\nOne member of the audience issue.<br />\nThis is the largest proposed<br />\nasked why some strains of a specie<br />\nbond issue in the history of<br />\nschool<br />\nare more aggressive than other<br />\nand it would provide<br />\ncity<br />\nthe<br />\nstrains.<br />\n$80 million in the next<br />\nthan<br />\nmore<br />\nThe professor said that preliminary experiments show there is 2 years.

These<br />\ninformal \"bull sessions\" might be<br />\nexpanded into a regular, perhaps<br />\nmonthly, schedule, Jacobs and<br />\nTreem said, if enough support is<br />\ngenerated. The faculty teas are<br />\nalso under consideration for expansion. The Symposium On<br />\nAggression and the other plans<br />\nwere all initiated solely by the<br />\nstudents in the Orientation Committee. Although they met much<br />\nfaculty and administration approval and assistance in getting speakers, the students are the motivating force. \"This student participation is essential for our program's success,\" Jacobs stated.<br />\n<br />\nurban crisis is the absence of<br />\nconcerned individuals who are<br />\nwilling to inform the residents of<br />\nwhite suburbia about the people<br />\nin the inner city and their problems by \"telling it like it is.\"<br />\nThe members of the SA Cabinet received this message from<br />\ninner city leaders at a special<br />\nmeeting in mid-September, and<br />\nthey have decided that Hopkins<br />\nstudents can play a definite part<br />\nin breaking down this information<br />\ngap. The SA will begin an experimental program in counteracting<br />\nwhite racism with a meeting for<br />\nall interested students this afternoon at 4 p.m. in Levering Hall.<br />\nJim Archibald and John Guess,<br />\nSA cabinet members who are<br />\nheading the program, have already<br />\ndevised some possible tactics for<br />\nreaching white communities in the<br />\nBaltimore area.

After showing the<br />\nmovies, members of the committee will try to promote discussion within the local group they<br />\nare visiting.<br />\nTalk Freely<br />\nArchibald emphasized that the<br />\ncommittee would accept invitations to speak from any group, but<br />\nthey would particularly like to<br />\nwork with student organizations,<br />\n<br />\nents could talk more freely with<br />\npeople their own age than vwith<br />\nmore conservative adult groups.<br />\nHe also emphasized that the<br />\nprogram is experimental in everY<br />\naspect and will require numerous<br />\nrevisions and several years to<br />\nreally become effective. He hoped<br />\nthat interested students would<br />\njoin the committee and devise<br />\nprograms of their own so the SA<br />\ncould try several different app oaches at the same time.<br />\nDespite the many obstacles<br />\nwhich the program faces, Guess<br />\nand Archibald feel that Hopkins<br />\nand the SA have to take a chance<br />\nbecause Baltimore's problems are<br />\ncentered in the white community<br />\nas well as in the black ghetto, and<br />\nBaltimore's power is concentr ted<br />\nalmost exclusively in the hands of<br />\nits white citizens.<br />\nOver thirty freshmen have volunteered to work on the committee.<br />\nANCHORS AWEIGH<br />\nThe first meeting of the<br />\nacademic year for the Homewood Sailing Club will be held<br />\nin Classroom 1 at the Newton<br />\nWhite Athletic Center.

In the ensuing years the games have been<br />\ndebased to the lowest level of political propaganda, and a less than<br />\nscrupulous business.

Despite our<br />\nera of turmoil, I trust that Mexico City will produce its Jesse Owens<br />\nand Luz Long. But the greatness in sports and the potential of the<br />\nOlympics, is that it represents life the way it should be. All are judged<br />\nonly by their ability and all play by the rules. This is very easy to say<br />\nand as yet impossible to achieve. If this can be transferred to daily<br />\nlife, then the Olympics will have served as a superlative example to all<br />\nthe world.

Jones warned prospective auditors: \"We'd<br />\nprobably question your motives.\"<br />\nThe Army's position is not one<br />\nto complement a university atmosphere of free inquiry. According<br /><br />\nto Col.

First, Hopkins is unique<br />\namong schools with fraternities in<br />\nthat Hopkins is all male, which<br />\ngives rise to certain social problems and the need for an outlet.<br />\nLack of a student union and the<br />\nfact that there is \"little for an<br />\nindependent to do\" are also cited<br />\nas reasons for the siie of the frats.<br />\nOf far more interest is the<br />\ncontention that, with the \"new<br />\nbreed\" of students i.e. the \"new<br />\nleft,\" the fraternities are becoming increasingly irrelevant, an anachronism of the raccoon coat<br />\nera. To this the fraternity would<br />\ncontend that activity oriented<br />\npeople are not excluded and it is<br />\ntrue that one sees a preponderence of frat men in such acceptable outlets at the student council<br />\nbut few in SDS.<br />\nFraternities are seen by the<br />\nSDS or activist type student as<br />\nanti-intellectual dens of beer<br />\ndrinking slobs interested only in<br />\nwenching and lacrosse.

It is,<br />\nand for some time has been, argued that fraternities, because of<br />\ntheir voluntary exclusiveness,<br />\ntheir hedonism, and their constitutional disinterest in extra-fraternity social problems are almost by<br />\ndefinition inimical to the goals of<br />\nhigher education, whatever that<br />\nphrase may mean.<br />\nFraternities have thus become<br />\nidentified in the popular mind, if<br />\nthere is one, with the forces of<br />\nreaction, with what now seems<br />\nthe anachronistic practices of<br />\nwithdrawal from the world outside the fraternity and an emphasis instead upon such non-existent<br />\ninanities as Spirit and Brotherhood.<br />\nThe fraternity man, once again<br />\nin his popular image, has become<br />\nsomething dehumanized - - a portable (sometimes) flask, an ambulatory pin and chain, a talking<br />\nhandshake, a tin grin, a being<br />\napart from others who spends his<br />\nfew waking hours alternately plotting how to keep the riff-raff out<br />\nof his hermetically sealed world<br />\nand concocting barrels of booze in<br />\norder to innoculate himself<br />\nagainst the perils of involement<br />\nwith whatever it is that exists out<br />\nthere beyond the lacrosse field.<br />\nAlter Charters<br />\nI would not claim that this<br />\nimage, if it does in fact exist in<br />\nthe minds of some, is totally<br />\ninaccurate. Some of the membership policies of today's social fraternities, for example, are an outrage and a disgrace; here at Hopkins the administration has been<br />\nshockingly negligent in enforcing<br />\nfair membership practices on the<br />\npart of fraternities. Why, I wonder, doesn't the national S.D.S.<br />\nturn its attention to this aspect of<br />\ncampus inequity and away from<br />\nthe rather nebulous problem of<br />\nstudent involvement in administrative functions?<br />\nNo social organization whose<br />\nmembership qualifications might<br />\nhave been those of Pre-Cambrian<br />\nAlabama should be allowed to<br />\nexist on this or any other college<br /><br />\ncampus. In recent years many<br />\ncollege administrations have forced discrimination fraternities<br />\neither to alter their charters or to<br />\nget out, and the administration<br />\nhere should do the same, whether<br />\nor not it offends some medieval<br />\nalumnae.<br />\nVegetative Mediocrity<br />\nIt is also quite true that frater-nities, which are indeed social<br />\norganizations, put the pursuit of<br />\npleasure rather high among their<br />\npriorities. It therefore also follows<br />\nthat they breed a certain insensitivity in their members as far as<br />\ncommunity involvement is concerned. The problems of war and<br />\npeace are often obliterated by<br />\nintramural tennis. And in such a<br />\nway it is quite obviously true that<br />\nfraternities are sometimes inimical<br />\nto whatever goals higher education may have.<br />\nThey may prevent members<br />\nfrom getting to know many different sorts of people rather than the<br />\nreverse; they idolize pleasure and<br />\nnon-involvement, as I have said;<br />\nand so inevitably they will come<br />\ninto conflict with many an individual's intellectual curiosity or seriousness of purpose - - any purpose.<br />\nIt is not good fraternal form,<br />\nfor example, to be intense about<br />\nanything, to be committed to<br />\nanything, to stand out in any way<br />\nfrom the vegetative mediocrity of<br />\nthe middle. One puts on a tie to<br />\nattend a non-compulsory lecture<br />\nand is ridiculed; this is the essence<br />\nof what I am talking about. The<br />\nslow erosion of innocent enthusiasm is accelerated by the fraternity, and all it has to replace<br />\nwhat's gone is cynicism (which<br />\nhas no surpassed the clap as the<br />\nmost virulent undergraduate disease).<br />\nNot Apologist<br />\nWhat I have said so far is part<br />\npopular fancy and part truth; in<br />\nsome fraternities the atrocities I<br />\nhave dredged up are matters of<br />\nfact, while in others they are<br />\nnon-existent. The fraternities,<br />\nhere and elsewhere, are as different as their members. No two<br />\npeople are exactly the same, and<br />\nfraternities are after all only the<br />\nsums of their individual parts.<br />\nI would say in the defense of<br />\nfraternities that I do think they<br />\nare often kicked around unfairly - for even though many of the<br />\npopular criticisms of fraternities<br />\nare indeed valid and proper, they<br />\noverlook a great deal.

The discussion, concerning the governmental<br />\npolicies of South Africa, was conducted by Dr. P.G.J.

Prior to the<br />\nspeech, nearly 50 people picketed<br />\nShriver Hall to protest the governme- policies. As one protestor<br />\nexp\u2014med,\"We do not deny them<br />\nthe right to speak, we are simply<br />\nprotesting their right to suppress<br />\nthe black of South Africa.\"<br />\nAfter the picketing, a rally was<br />\nheld on the steps of Shriver to<br />\ninform those present of \"the true<br />\nstate of affairs in South Africa.\"<br />\nDr. David Cohen, professor of<br />\nAfrican History at Hopkins, spoke<br />\non \"South African Atrocities\" at<br />\nthe rally. The rally was organized<br />\nby the SDS to demonstrate that<br />\n\"Americans do not approve of the<br />\nSouth African policies, despite the<br />\nU.S. government's support of the<br />\nregime.\"<br />\nAfter the rally, the protestors<br />\nmoved into the Clipper Room,<br />\nwhere the symposium was being<br />\nheld, in order to hear the South<br />\nAfricans speak. Many carried signs<br />\ninto the room protesting the ra-<br /><br />\ncism of South Africa.<br />\nThe speeches were frequently<br />\ninterrupted by jeers and differences of opinion, but the speeches,<br />\non the whole, were allowed to<br />\nproceed without major disruption.<br />\nAfter the speeches, however,<br />\nthe floor was thrown open to<br />\nquestions, and the verbal pyrotechnics started. A South African<br />\nblack, currently attending school<br />\nin the United States, presented hi<br />\nown view point on the racial<br />\nsituation and replied to \"many of<br />\nthe lies\" told by the South African visitors. He questioned Dr.<br />\nKoornhof's description of South<br />\nAfrica as \"a miracle in race relations, a Christian and a happy<br />\ncountry.\"<br />\nAt one point, Manuel Rodriguez, the moderator, attempted to<br />\nend the meeting, but was forced<br />\nto let it continue when those<br />\npresent angrily demanded to \"Let<br />\nus finish.\" He was eventually forced to end the meeting to allow<br />\nthe Africans to meet prior commitments. Enough questions and<br />\nanswers were fired back and forth,<br />\nbefore they were forced to leave,<br />\nto produce angry and enlightening<br />\nreplies on both sides.<br />\nDean Rudoy, the executive<br />\nsecretary, commented that he was<br />\npleased with the meeting, as a<br />\n\"very vital and dynamic dialogue<br />\ndeveloped, and the purpose of the<br />\nInternational Forum is to provide<br />\nand induce a dialogue within the<br />\nHopkins community.\" Rodriguez<br />\ncommented that \"I think we all<br />\nlearned something.

Hopkins, through its<br />\nprograms of government research and through<br />\nthe status which it accords the ROTC program,<br />\nhas committed itself to the questionabe goals<br />\nof our national \"defense\" effort,(\"defense,\"it<br />\nis well to remember, being a very dubious, very<br />\nNewspeak term).<br />\nWe are not trying to inject a moral issue<br />\nhere, for admittedly, morality is an elusive and<br />\npossibly moot question. However, those who<br />\nare concerned about the University must confront the question of the ideals upon which a<br />\nuniversity is founded, and the role in society<br />\nwhich a university must play.<br />\nThe University is a unique institution which<br />\nholds the crucial position of being able to freely<br />\nand independently offer its critiques and innovations to society - - and its reputation as the<br />\n\"cutting edge\" of society is maintained by its<br />\nefforts to remain as an impartial observer. This<br />\nstatus allows the University to protect its<br />\nscholars from outside pressures by avoiding the<br />\nestablishment of inflexible commitments to any<br />\nfaction or any set of policies. The University's<br />\nnon-partisan nature, as an institution, is crucial<br />\nto its progress.<br />\nYet, the University's present commitment to<br />\nthe military objectives of our government<br />\nthreaten to undercut this stance. Though it<br />\nwould be unthinkable for Hopkins, as an<br />\ninstitution, to \"take sides\" on the issue of<br />\nVietnam, those who supported the continuance<br />\nof University military research grants in the<br />\nHouse Armed Services Committee (1968)<br />\nstated that such research is crucial to our war<br />\neffort in Vietnam.<br />\nMoreover, a substantial number of the officers now serving in the military services come<br />\nfrom college ROTC programs. The University<br />\nhas chosen to side with the armed services by<br />\nmaking ROTC enrollment particularly alluring - the Army supplies scholarships and draft<br />\ndeferments, while the University awards \"student-soldiers\" academic credit to be figured in<br />\ntheir grade-point average, (though such credit<br />\ndoes not count towards the B.A. requirements).<br />\nBy these actions, Hopkins has chosen to<br />\nalign itself with certain military objectives, and<br />\nit must be remembered that these military<br />\nobjectives have been an integral part of our<br />\nforeign policy objectives. The Institution of<br />\nHopkins has indeed chosen sides; and, by doing<br />\nso, has compromised the independence of the<br />\nUniversity and its scholars.<br />\nAn equally important question concerns<br />\nese decisions and commitments were<br />\nha<br />\nm what we have been able to learn,<br />\nma<br />\nthe majority of such commitments were made<br />\nby a handful of faculty and administration<br />\nmembers.<br /><br />\nBruce Drake<br /><br />\nDavid Cooper<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,OCT 18, 1968<br /><br />\nDennis Estis<br /><br />\nJames Franke<br /><br />\nthese committees). Considering the importance<br />\nof the University in society, we feel that such<br />\nmethods are gravely wanting. We wonder how<br />\nlong crucial issues which affect our University<br />\nwill be decided in this manner.<br />\nSpecifically, we question the status which<br />\nthe University has afforded the ROTC program,<br />\nand we question the policies which Hopkins<br />\npresently holds in relation to \"defense\" research.<br />\nWe don't dispute the right of ROTC to exist<br />\non campus. However, we do dispute the contention that it deserves higher status than any<br />\ncampus extra-curricular activity, and we dispute<br />\nthe argument that its present status at a private<br />\nuniversity is in the \"national interest.\" We<br />\nquestion the terms of the contract upon which<br />\nHopkins agreed to institute the ROTC program<br />\nat Homewood; namely, that its instructors<br />\nautomatically are elevated to a faculty rank,<br />\nthat its courses be placed on a near-equal basis<br />\nwith the \"civilian\" curriculum and that the<br />\nUniversity has little or no control over subject<br />\nmatter. We contend that the principle of \"free<br />\ninquiry\" is violated by the fact that students<br />\ncannot audit a military science course without<br />\nenrolling in ROTC. We oppose the awarding of<br />\nacademic credit in any form to ROTC students.<br />\nConcerning the question of \"defense\" research: we do not doubt that it has a place in<br />\nthe University. However, we do question certain aspects of our commitment to \"defense\"<br />\nprojects and we are concerned with the wider<br />\nimplications which they entail.<br />\nTherefore, we call on the Academic Council<br />\nand the Student Council, groups supposedly<br />\nrepresentative of the faculty and students, to<br />\nundertake the following steps independently of<br />\nthe University administration:<br />\n1. To establish a committee to operate<br />\nindependently from both groups to begin an<br />\nimmediate investigation and series of hearing<br />\nconcerning the status of ROTC at the University. This committee would present its findings<br />\nand recommendations to the Administration.<br />\n2. To establish another committee, also<br />\noperating independently, to assess the role of<br />\nHopkins in \"defense\" research and to hold<br />\nhearings to sound out viewpoints of Hopkins<br />\nstudents, faculty, administration and research<br />\npersonnel. This committee would also report its<br />\nfindings and recommendations to the University.<br />\nWe do not plan to let these issues die in the<br />\nusual Hopkins tradition. We also urge those<br />\nindividuals and groups who are concerned<br />\nabout the issues raised here to pressure the<br />\nStudent and Academic Councils to act in these<br />\nareas. For too long these groups have been the<br />\nlast to address the issues, when they should<br />\nhave been first.<br /><br />\nPostscript<br />\nIt is not irrelevant here to point out the ill<br />\neffects of \"defense\" work on the mental<br />\nprocesses. It seems that prolonged contact with<br />\nsuch research adversely affects one's memory.<br />\nCases in point are<br />\nofficials at Hopkins,<br />\nBruce Partridge, and<br />\nheads the Institute for<br /><br />\ncertain Administrative<br />\nnotably Vice-President<br />\nBenjamin Willis (who<br />\nCooperative Research).<br /><br />\nLast year there was reportedly a faculty<br />\ncommittee, including some students, who reviewed the ROTC program and effected the<br />\nsuggestion to discontinue the counting of<br />\nROTC credits towards the PA. degee. There<br />\nwas also a University committee which hammered out a statement of Hopkins policy<br />\ntowards government research.<br /><br />\nWhen questioned by the News-Letter for<br />\nthe story which appeared in last week's issue,<br />\nboth men denied that Hopkins did any research<br />\nin connection with Fort Detrick at the present<br />\ntime. Fort Detrick is one of the largest chemical<br />\nand biological warfare research centers in the<br />\nworld.<br /><br />\nHowever, we feel that neither of these<br />\ncommittees did a comprehensive, honest, or<br />\nthorough job. Moreover, they were conducted,<br />\nfor the most part, without the participation of<br />\nconcerned elements in the Hopkins community<br />\n(in fact, few people knew of the existence of<br /><br />\nHowever, when Mr. Willis was prompted<br />\nwith certain facts during the past week, his<br />\npartial amnesia was overcome, and he remembered that yes indeed, Hopkins is presently<br />\nlinked to the work at Fort Detrick.<br />\nStrange. Strange.<br /><br />\nLEAVE GEORGE ALONE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the<br />\nNews-Letter's definitive rebuttal<br />\nof George Corley Wallace should<br />\nbe such a squidlike ink of<br />\nundisciplined rhetoric and<br />\ndirectionless thought. The content<br />\nof the News-Letter is supposedly<br />\ndirected at an audience of better<br />\nthan average intellectual capacity,<br />\nand if such be the case, let us<br />\nforego such paralogistic spasms,<br />\neven in so noble a cause as<br />\nopposition to G.C. His intellectual<br />\ndefeat certainly does not require<br />\nit. His mini-thoughts are too easily<br />\ndestroyed by an application of<br />\ndetached reason. Rationality<br />\nvanquishes bomb-like bursts of<br />\ndirelict emotion. Responses<br />\ncontaining more of the same<br />\nsimply make losers of all<br />\nparticipants.<br />\nMost offensive, perhaps, is<br />\nLevine's unrelenting tone of<br />\nincrediable arrogance. He is the<br />\nself-appointed Interpreter and<br />\nGuardian of All Quintessential<br />\nTruths, with the derivative<br />\nfunction, Supreme Arbiter of<br />\nValue Judgements. But must he<br />\nbe so sloppy?

But<br />\nthen his analyses are in perfect<br />\nharmony with his prose. One can<br />\nonly pity the \"commie-faggot<br />\nconspiracy\" which he has believed<br />\nin for the last five or six years.<br /><br />\nWhy does it matter that, in the<br />\nopinion of Mr. Levine, the Wallace<br />\nworkers were \"decidedly unattractive, with their cheap round-collared white shirts and blue<br />\nshirts?\" I dare say most of the<br />\nsupporters of Robert Kennedy,<br />\nEugene McCarthy, Richard Nixon<br />\nand Hubert Humphrey were decidedly unattractive, and some even<br />\nhad \"stringy blonde hair ,\" as horrible as that may seem!!! May I<br />\nalso ask Mr. Levine where he<br />\nobtained his information that the<br />\nWallace workers are \"the girls who<br />\nare the outsiders, the hangers-on<br />\nof school social life. They sit in<br />\nthe back of high school history<br />\nclasses unnoticed by the rest of<br />\nthe students. They struggle for C's<br />\nin school . . .\"I imagine that he<br />\nheld a poll of these people. Surely<br />\nhe would not make these emotional appeals to bias and self\u2014<br />\nesteem without some basis in<br />\nfact?!<br />\nIt would take an article twice<br />\nas long as the original to fully<br />\ncondemn by direct analysis the<br />\nabsurdity of the statements made<br />\nby Art Levine. It would probably<br />\ntake even longer to correct his<br />\ngrammatical mistakes (\"the man<br />\nwas sitting ... drinking a bottle\"),<br />\nbut certain comments must be<br />\nmade. This is the election year in<br />\nthe history of the U.S. during<br />\nwhich the people need least an<br />\nappeal to emotionalism, egotism,<br />\nand bias. Any discussion of the<br />\ncandidates must be on a rational<br />\nlevel, a study of the ideas of each<br />\n(if indeed he has any), in a well\u2014<br />\nthought-out, well structured appraisal. The \"nobodiness\" that<br />\nMr. Levine talks of will be achieved by those who fail to follow<br />\nthese standards, by those who<br />\nreject thought in favor of blind<br />\ndevotion to bias.

(Part One)<br />\nBy BILL SAKOWICH<br />\nThe following is a true story<br />\nwritten from first hand experience. The author of this article<br />\ndoes not try to gain applause or<br />\nsympathy for himself, nor is he<br />\ntrying to satisfy an ego drive. He<br />\nis merely trying to tell a story in a<br />\nparticular style designed to best<br />\nobtain his ends. The story is told<br />\nas it happened. It makes no difference to the author if people agree<br />\nor disagree with him. He just feels<br />\nthat the story has to be told.<br />\nIN THE BEGINNING<br />\n\"Television, children fed .<br />\nIn a sunny corner of Southeast<br />\nVirginia,. Sakowich very excitedly<br />\nwatched a large Crusader jet fighter shaft the beach as part of<br />\nmock invasion under Navy control<br />\nprogressed. Already, his impressionable mind and character with<br />\nits African Genesis was stirred to<br />\nthe quick by events leading up to<br />\nthe strafing under the combined<br />\nforces of America's military<br />\nmight.<br />\nHe had been greeted by martial<br />\nmusic blaring out patriotic tunes,<br />\nwhich excited his instinct to kill<br />\nfor his country much in the way<br />\nthat the Turkish and the Vietnamese have been fed hashish to excite their instincts before a battle.<br />\nFirst came the pounding of<br />\noff shore artillery designed to soften up the enemy, while large<br />\norange bursts exploded across the<br />\nbeach simulating exploding shells.<br />\nThe people around Sakowich<br />\nwatched with awe as they saw the<br />\ninstruments of self-defense being<br />\nput to use, watchers from bleachers instead of armchairs.<br />\n\"Bullet strikes the helmet's<br />\nhead .. .\"<br />\nThe whole scene prompted<br />\nSakowich to ask himself jokingly<br />\nhow much money could have<br />\nbeen made had enough bleachers<br />\nbeen set up ,at Normandy.<br />\n\"hotdogs! sofdrinks! peenuts!<br />\nicecolebeeyar!!!\"<br />\nThe next attraction of the<br />\nthree ring circus was the paratroop scene with landings in the<br />\nocean, gray amphibians swimming<br />\nto the beach like killer frogs,<br />\nblowing up more obstructions.<br />\nThen came the planes and copters.<br />\nThen the soldiers.<br />\nScreaming like a father at the<br />\nprospect of his daughter's shotgun<br />\nwedding. The soldiers landed and<br />\ncharged the shore bent on destruction. After all the foreplay,<br />\nSakowich thought, it was about<br />\ntime they reached orgasm.<br />\nSome falling and dying in<br />\nmock agony, exultant in mock<br />\nvictory; planes strafing, ship firing, helicopters landing, the military man calling the play by play.<br />\nOne thousand tongues applauding as the zouaves went to bat.<br />\nAnd Sakowich could feel his<br />\ninstincts stirring, the desire to<br />\ndestroy, the feeling for his fatherland, the glory of his Army. And<br />\nhe smiled a frightening smile.<br />\n\u2022\"It's all over<br />\nFor the Unknown Soldier.<br />\nPART TWO<br />\nSakowich noticed in between<br />\nHerman's Hermits and Freddy and<br />\nthe Dreamers on the radio an<br />\ninteresting advertisement. It was<br />\ntime to think of college and how<br />\nto finance it, and how to fulfill<br />\none's military obligations. The<br />\nhigh school senior absorbed the<br />\ntelevision commercials which told<br />\ntold of the Army's desire for men.<br />\nWhich is just what he was. A man.<br /><br />\nJOHN P.

Sakowich would do it, and<br />\nlike it for awhile. It was his first<br />\nstep on the way to becoming a<br />\nresponsible citizen.<br />\nPART THREE \"Unborn living,<br />\nLiving dead.<br />\nIt was rather interesting for<br />\nSakowich to walk throuti that<br />\nline. Hurry up and wait, hurry up<br />\nand wait. He was receiving his<br />\nclothes to go in to the Army<br />\nROTC. As the Government manual told him, he was exercising his<br />\nfree will, displaying his individuality by doing his Army thing.<br />\nThe first witness, Bob<br />\nSo if the will goes<br />\nGreenblatt<br />\nin just a part<br />\n\"We don't have your size in<br />\nshirts and socks or shirts and<br />\npants.

On the wall<br />\nwas a graphic account of how the<br />\nuniforms had changed throughout<br />\nthe years. Sakowich noticed the<br />\nexquisite physical appearance of<br />\nthe models in uniform. The males<br />\nwere typical Adonises, all serving<br />\ntheir individual consciences by<br />\nserving in the Armed Forces of<br />\ntheir nation, good Christian God\u2014<br />\nfearing young men, with an apple-pie sex appeal.<br />\nAnd the Women's Army, 0<br />\nGod the women, in a uniform up<br />\nto date with all the current fashion trends, looking for all the<br />\nworld like the peaches and cream<br />\ndecency of American Femmes<br />\nFatales, these peace-loving Commie haters whose standard line is<br />\nsomething like--\"But my Mother<br />\nnever even let me date boys in the<br />\nService!\"<br />\nAnd Sakowich wondered what<br />\nkind of woman voluntarily participated in a supposedly masculine<br />\nendeavor.<br />\nAnd then, days later, smartly<br />\nWe need your head in our<br />\nbusiness<br /><br />\nSt. Paul Barber Shop<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br />\nAcross from Eddie's<br /><br />\nattired in his shinyuniform and<br />\nshiny black shoes and short haircut the young cosmopolitan killer<br />\nventured out to campus to show<br />\nthat he was proud to be an American. Later on, at Leadership laboratory (which is known usually<br />\nunder the pseudonym of close\u2014<br />\norder drill) there were flag salutes,<br />\nattention, present arms, fall out,<br />\nfall in, forward harch, lefrahlefrahlefrayelef, yes SIR no SIR, about<br />\nface, fun, guns, aim shoot,<br />\nsqueeze, hit, dead, gone-but-notforgotten,and then nothing, noth-<br /><br />\ning at all .<br />\nThen there was quick kill,relying on the instinct to kill quickly<br />\nwithout thinking, just to fire and<br />\ntrust your instincts.<br />\nAnd then Sakowich saw<br />\nmaneuvers, war games, K-rations,<br />\nPershing Rifles (the 16th fraternity); how to cross a mined path,<br />\ncrawl under wires, run, get wet,<br />\nscream , march, be with your<br />\nbuddies, about face, salute, take<br />\nthe hill and kill, kill.<br />\nFor you and the flag.

Roger Vadim<br />\ntakes full advantage of his wife's<br />\ndramatic abilities, and, observant<br />\ndirector that he is, does not fail to<br />\nrecord every little wiggle in her<br />\ndarling derriere. The photography<br />\nand visual effects are usually quite<br />\nadequate, though the swirling colors are not unusual in the era of<br />\nthe psychedelic light show.<br />\nVadim has succeeded in his<br />\npurpose and produced an entertaining movie, a color cartoon for<br />\nadults. It is satire on the genre<br />\nwhich spawned it, the comic<br />\nbooks and science fiction stories,<br />\nand to do so it must and does<br />\nretain the forms and methods of<br />\nthat esoteric branch of literature.<br />\nOne could look deep into the film<br /><br />\nand uncover moralistic ideas by<br />\ntranslating locations and time<br />\nperiods, if one is wont to do such<br />\nthings while Jane Fonda's body is<br />\nbeing projected onto the screen.<br />\nFellini's La Dolce Vita was meant<br />\nto be a moralistic film, when<br />\nsuperficially it did not appear so.<br />\nBut Vadim has no surprises for us,<br />\nnot possessing a reputation for<br />\ndidactic movies. Unfortunately,<br />\nthis reviewer has not yet discerned<br />\nthe meta-physical and theological<br />\nimplications of the ending, in<br />\nwhich Pygar the blind angel soars<br />\noff into a technicolor firmament<br />\nwith both Barbarella and the<br />\nBlack Queen, good and evil, grasped firmly under his wings, to a<br />\nplace which only God and Roger<br />\nVadim know of.

And<br />\nSakowich had to wince when he<br />\nlooked at it all.<br />\nVery conscientiously, Sakowich tried, in a determined waY,<br />\nto make the best of things, to be a<br />\npride of his nation and act accept'<br />\nably. But the cause was lost, it<br />\nwas like trying to hold the earth<br />\nof Vietnam in your figners. It was<br />\nimpossible. And he realized it<br />\neach time he put on that uniform,<br />\nand combed that hair back, and<br />\nevery time he was taught the<br />\nprinciple of _the command voice,<br />\nand had to take orders from 3<br />\nbroken piece of hand-me-down<br />\nhumanity.<br />\nSo if the will goes in just a part<br />\nof yourself, it goes everywhere,<br />\nand that bright, shiny, hopeful<br />\nyoung man who made it to the<br />\nplace on Charles Street left as a<br />\nrusty piece of pipe, cast aside by<br />\nthe military machine as an indi'<br />\nvidual with a conscience, as one<br />\nwho had finally realized what the<br />\nstory was, and would not let<br />\nhimself be compromised, and<br />\ntherefore was useless to the ArMY<br />\nand to his nation.<br />\nSakowich still walks Homewood Campus this year, 1-A with<br />\nthe draft. He is a bit different<br />\nthan he was last year, but wiser<br />\nfor his Army days. And his life<br />\nlast year left him a little bit<br />\nsadder.<br />\nBut then again a whole lot<br />\nhappier.<br />\nIN CONCLUSION<br />\nNor does the Sakowich storY<br />\nend here.

The trauma<br />\nof the violence that followed police intervention intensified emotions but broad support for the<br /><br />\ndemonstrators rested upon broad<br />\ndiscontent and .widespread sympathy for their position.\"<br />\nThe report's conclusion was a<br />\nhopeful one - - that if students<br />\nwere given a significant voice in<br />\nuniversity affairs, the need for<br />\nprotests like last spring's would<br />\ndisappear and the university might<br />\nbe come a, place to live and learn<br />\nin again.<br />\nThe commission thinks students who had a part in the<br />\ndecision-making of the university<br />\nwould \"acquire a more sophisticated understanding of the university's difficulties and complexities,\"<br />\nand become more sympathetic<br />\nwith \"the necessary functions\" of<br />\nthe administration and governing<br />\nbody.<br />\nBoth students and faculty<br />\nmembers, according to Harvard<br />\nUniversity law professor Archibald Cox, who wrote most of the<br />\nreport, have tried and failed to<br />\nfind a meaningful voice in the<br />\nuniversity because of the authoritarianism and indifference of administrators like President Grayson Kirk and those who worked<br />\nunder him.

Right now there is very<br />\nlittle.\"<br />\nApathy Reigns<br />\nThis lack of intellectual stimulation is due, the two seniors<br />\nbelieve, to a sense of apathy on<br />\nthe part of many Hopkins students. The Orientation Committee<br />\nattempted to create an atmosphere earlier this year for creative<br />\nthinking through its orientation of<br />\nthe freshman class. But they see<br />\nthe need of intellectual expansion<br />\nin all the classes.<br />\nTherefore, the Committee discarded their original idea of holding symposia only for freshmen,<br />\nand have opened them to all<br />\nstudents. Aggression was picked<br />\nbecause, in Jacob's words, \"it is a<br />\nbroad topic of immediate importance to our present affairs.\"<br />\nJacobs and Treem hope to<br />\nplace the lectures on a permanent<br />\nbasis if there is enough student<br />\nparticipation. Treem stated, \"We<br />\nare not really interested in the<br />\nquantity of participation, but<br />\nmore the quality and enthusiasm<br />\nof a small group.\" The format of<br />\nthe 8 p.m. programs at Levering<br />\nconsists of a 45 minute lecture by<br />\nan expert in the topic for the<br />\nnight followed by audience questions and discussion.<br />\nSouthwick Speaks<br />\nDr. Charles H. Southwick, a<br />\nHopkins Professor of Pathobiology, began the lectures last Sunday.<br />\nHe spoke on the biological bases<br />\nin animals and humans for aggression. Before an audience of about<br />\n60, Southwick related the two<br />\ndominant theories on animal aggression.<br />\nThe instinction hypothesis was<br />\nforwarded by Conrad Lorenz in<br />\nhis well-known book On Aggression. Lorenz, Dr. Southwick explained, believes that in all animals, including man, lay innate<br />\naggressive drives. These drives express themselves when one animal<br />\n' attacks another of the same specie.<br />\nJ.P. Scott, author of Aggression, is the leader of the environmentalist school. These biologists contend that man and animals become aggressive due to<br />\nenvironmental conditions such as<br />\nisolation, education, competition,<br />\netc. Dr. Southwich favored this<br />\ntheory.<br />\nThe Hopkins pathobiologist<br />\nsaid that most animal aggression is<br />\nconstructive and rarely leads to<br />\ninjury or death. \"The fight to the<br />\ndeath\" among similar specie,<br />\nSouthwick stated, is uncommon<br />\nin the animal world.<br />\nThree Areas<br />\nDr. Southwick saw three areas<br />\nwhere fatal aggression occurs. Unusual enviornmental conditions<br />\nsuch as captivity or isolation will<br />\nlead to an aggressive animal behavior. Also, fighting will result<br />\nwhen two social groups of a specie<br />\ncome into direct contact.<br />\nIn most animals, he explained,<br />\nthere is a great feeling towards<br />\ncolony and territorial recognition.<br />\nWhen any other of the same genus<br />\nencroaches upon another group,<br />\nthe death of the first will normally result. Social disorganization is<br />\nthe third area in which aggressive<br />\nbehavior materializes, according<br />\nto Southwick. Many times, this<br />\ndisorganization is caused by a high<br />\npcipulation density.<br />\nSlides were shown of a number<br />\nof experiments with mice. The<br />\nevidence seemed contradictory at<br />\ntimes and inconclusive, and Dr.<br /><br />\nIn answer to a special plea<br />\nevitably cause an aggressive behaMayor D'Alesandro the Stufrom<br />\nvior.<br />\ndent Association is organizing students to hand out literature in<br />\nWhat A Strain<br />\nfavor of the city school bond<br />\nOne member of the audience issue.<br />\nThis is the largest proposed<br />\nasked why some strains of a specie<br />\nbond issue in the history of<br />\nschool<br />\nare more aggressive than other<br />\nand it would provide<br />\ncity<br />\nthe<br />\nstrains.<br />\n$80 million in the next<br />\nthan<br />\nmore<br />\nThe professor said that preliminary experiments show there is 2 years.

These<br />\ninformal \"bull sessions\" might be<br />\nexpanded into a regular, perhaps<br />\nmonthly, schedule, Jacobs and<br />\nTreem said, if enough support is<br />\ngenerated. The faculty teas are<br />\nalso under consideration for expansion. The Symposium On<br />\nAggression and the other plans<br />\nwere all initiated solely by the<br />\nstudents in the Orientation Committee. Although they met much<br />\nfaculty and administration approval and assistance in getting speakers, the students are the motivating force. \"This student participation is essential for our program's success,\" Jacobs stated.<br /><br />\nurban crisis is the absence of<br />\nconcerned individuals who are<br />\nwilling to inform the residents of<br />\nwhite suburbia about the people<br />\nin the inner city and their problems by \"telling it like it is.\"<br />\nThe members of the SA Cabinet received this message from<br />\ninner city leaders at a special<br />\nmeeting in mid-September, and<br />\nthey have decided that Hopkins<br />\nstudents can play a definite part<br />\nin breaking down this information<br />\ngap.

From all sides the enemies of the \"Olympic Spirit\" seek<br />\nto snuff out one meager flame of Utopia still burning in the world.<br />\nSouth Africa's revolving-door acceptance into the Olympic<br />\nBrotherhood, the American Negro's almost paranoiac boycott, and<br />\nthe gore filled streets of the Aztec capital itself; all are sadly indicative<br />\nof humanity's sickness.<br />\nONCE UPON A DREAM<br />\nThe modern games were reincarnated in 1896 by the French<br />\nBaron Pierre de Coubertin as an ideal to rise above the hatreds of<br />\ninternational politics. In the ensuing years the games have been<br />\ndebased to the lowest level of political propaganda, and a less than<br />\nscrupulous business. In the appropriate mood of bitterness, it<br />\nbehooves us to retell the story of the Olympic's noblest moment.<br />\n* *****<br />\nJesse Owens was startled. The official had just called his practice<br />\nsprint down the broad jump runway, with his sweater on, a foul. The<br />\n\"world's fastest human\" wasnt't easily dismayed. He had already<br />\ncollected gold medals in the 100 meter sprint, 200 meter sprint, and<br />\nthe 400 meter relay races. Now he approached the sand pit for his<br />\n\"second jump.\" Misjudging the take off point, he fouled again. One<br />\nmore foul and he would lose the event to the muscular German, Luz<br />\nLong.<br />\nARYAN ASSISTANCE<br />\nThe bewildered American Black glanced at Adolf Hitler, who was<br />\nhoping to preside over a conquest of one of his Aryan supermen. This<br />\nwas the Berlin Olympics of 1936 and the world gritted its teeth as the<br />\nall time champion of genocide and demagoguery schemed a world<br />\nwar.<br />\nLong came over and gave Owens a hint so he would avoid fouling<br />\non his third and final attempt. The American took heed of the<br />\n4<br />\n/<br />\nGerman's message, and soared to a new world's record of 26 feet 51<br />\ninches and captured his fourth gold medal.<br />\nThe German boy threw his arms around the victorious Jesse<br />\nOwens, and the Fuhrer stomped out in disgust.<br />\n* * * ***<br />\nIN SEARCH OF CORTEZ<br />\nThe present Olympics are a hypocrisy to the world. Despite our<br />\nera of turmoil, I trust that Mexico City will produce its Jesse Owens<br />\nand Luz Long. But the greatness in sports and the potential of the<br />\nOlympics, is that it represents life the way it should be. All are judged<br />\nonly by their ability and all play by the rules. This is very easy to say<br />\nand as yet impossible to achieve. If this can be transferred to daily<br />\nlife, then the Olympics will have served as a superlative example to all<br />\nthe world. However, until we are ready to accept the \"Olympic<br />\nSpirit\", this week's games will remain but another vestige of dying<br />\nidealism.<br /><br />\nBy SKIP HUNT<br />\nThe most refreshing thing<br />\nabout the varsity eleven's 35 to 20<br />\nwin over Ursinus Saturday is that<br />\nit showed that Jim Feely can still<br />\nthrow a football and Joe Cowan<br />\ncan still catch one.<br />\nAfter the humiliating defeat to<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall at Homewood (and the dubious victory<br />\nthe week before), people were<br />\ncomparing Feely's arm to a rubber<br />\nband and Cowan's hands to the<br />\nrock formations of Stonehenge.<br />\nSaturday the voices were silent.<br /><br />\nCowan snared two Feely throws Weiss is the man who routineh'<br />\nand ran them in from 64 yrards lets Cowan and the rest of the<br />\nout.
