Citing a new study, \"Involvement in Learning: Realizing the Potential of American<br />\nHigher Education\", he says<br />\nthat a fifth year may be needed<br />\nin certain undergraduate programs to arrest the \"increasingly early encroachment of professionalism into liberal arts.\"<br />\nWhile such a move might mean<br />\nadditional burdens on student<br />\nfinances, he adds,\"We need to<br />\nhave broadly educated men and<br />\nwomen\" if the United States is<br />\nto maintain its standing in the<br />\nworld.<br />\nBut extra semesters offer no<br />\nassurances that they'll be wellspent. As Bell well knows, it's<br />\nquality \u2014 not quantity \u2014 that<br />\ncounts. Students are already<br />\nconfused about the value of<br />\nliberal arts; if the five-year plan<br />\nis to receive official sanction,<br />\neducators will need to clarify<br />\nthe ambiguities.<br />\nUndergraduate America's<br />\ngradual abandonment of the<br />\nhumanities is an open sore. As<br />\n\"Involvement in Learning\"<br />\npoints out, the share of<br />\nbachelor's degrees awarded in<br />\nprofessional or vocational programs rose from about half to<br />\nalmost two-thirds between 1971<br />\nand 1982. Freshmen aren't even<br />\ngoing for the life sciences as<br />\nthey used to; not coincidentally, degrees in business administration and engineering<br />\nenjoy a healthy demand.<br />\nComputer science and electrical engineering, for example,<br />\nare so hot at the Massachusetts<br />\n<br />\nInstitute of Technology that the<br />\nschool may have to trim enrollment in both programs. OneM.I.T.'s<br />\nof<br />\nfourth<br />\nundergraduate student body<br />\nhas signed on with the electrical<br />\nengineering department.<br />\nMeanwhile, a mastery of the<br />\nhistory,<br />\nhumanities<br />\n\u2014<br />\ngeography,<br />\nlanguages,<br />\nliterature, etc. \u2014 appears more<br />\nneeded than ever. According to<br />\n\"Involvement in Learning,\"<br />\nscores in 11 of 15 categories of<br />\nthe Graduate Record Examinations declined between 1964<br />\nand 1982.<br />\n<br />\nMaxwell<br />\n<br />\nlen<br />\nCody<br />\nhearer<br />\nEvery professor has his or<br />\nher own horror story. But one<br />\nof the more astounding comes<br />\nfrom a geography prof at<br />\nCalifornia State University at<br />\nFullerton, who recently found<br />\nthat three-fourths of his<br />\nfreshman class couldn't locate<br />\nEl Salvador. Fewer than half of<br />\nhis students even knew where<br />\nAtlanta was; many confused<br />\nJapan with New Zealand.<br />\nThe seven authors of \"Involvement in Learning\" suggest<br />\nthat two full years of liberal arts<br />\neducation would help to<br />\nalleviate such ignorance. One<br />\nmember of the panel, Zelda<br />\nGamson, of the University of<br />\nMichigan, adds another incentive: Since, on the average, people change jobs at least five<br />\ntimes before their 40th birthday, \"liberal arts provide<br />\n(them) with a range of skills<br />\n<br />\n1111<br />\n<br />\nand attitudes that help them in<br />\nall aspects of their lives.\"<br />\nSome students would hardly<br />\nnotice the shift. Several<br />\nschools, in fact (among them<br />\nWilliams College and M.I.T.),<br />\nhave jointly run professional<br />\nprograms of five or more years<br />\nsince the 1950's, according to<br />\nPresident Mark Curtis of the<br />\nAmerican Association of<br />\nColleges.<br />\nBut a five-year program in<br />\nadministration,<br />\nbusiness<br />\nengineering and other professions would, if initiated at most<br />\ncolleges and universities, invite<br />\npredictably skeptical<br />\na<br />\nresponse. How, for example,<br />\ndo you assume an aspiring<br />\nDavid Packard that an extra<br />\nyear of Kierkegaard and Hemingway will give him a<br />\nreasonable rate of return on the<br />\n$5,000 or more it will cost?<br />\nYou can't \u2014 with much ease,<br />\nat least \u2014 stretch the economic<br />\nbenefits too far. While it's said<br />\nthat good writing and literary<br />\nskills are at a premium these<br />\ndays, the writers and readers<br />\nstill appear to be waiting tables.<br />\nWith some exceptions, tips<br />\ndon't make for early loan<br />\nrepayments.<br />\nBut there is some economic<br />\nallure to what might seem<br />\nsuperfluous. A study of its<br />\nemployees by American<br />\nTelephone and Telegraph some<br />\ntime ago indicated that liberal<br />\narts graduates moved up the<br />\ncorporate hierarchy more<br />\nquickly than degree-holders in<br />\nboth business administration<br />\nand engineering.<br />\nAT&T's case, duplicated at<br />\nmany other companies, could<br />\nbecome part of an initial sales<br />\npitch for the five-year degree.<br />\nIts advocates still need to explain how the extra semesters<br />\nwon't simply be a windfall for<br />\ntreasuries.<br />\nuniversity<br />\nCopyright 1984<br />\nNews Group Chicago, Inc.<br />\nNews America Syndicate<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n,\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2014 ,.,,\u201e .<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n100 E. 33rd St. 1 BLOCK FROM CAMPl JS<br />\nFor Appointment Tues-Sat Call<br />\n235-7083<br />\n10.<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Student Rate with ID<br />\n<br />\n44<br />\n<br />\nOVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT<br />\nWORLD-SIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEN AND WOMEN!<br />\nJAPAN - EUROPE - AFRICA - AUSTRALIA - THE .;{.)LTTH<br />\nPACIFIC -SOUTH AMERICA - THE FAR EAST.<br />\nEXCELLENT BENEFITS.

It looks and<br />\nsounds like no other, and owes<br />\nvery little to the rock-film making formulas of the past. The<br />\nsound is crisp and clear, thanks<br />\nto the pioneering use of<br />\n24-track digital recording. The<br />\nvisual style of this live performance is as precise, yet as<br />\nanomalous, as the Talking<br />\nHeads themselves. From the<br />\nopening image\u2014the shadow of<br />\na guitar neck looming against a<br />\nwhite wall\u2014Mr. Demme<br />\ndemonstrates that he is very<br />\nwell attuned to the racially and<br />\nsexually integrated band's oddities, which make their performance unlike anything that one<br />\nwould find in the standard concert film.<br />\nThe focus of the performance is lead singer David<br />\nByrne, who is credited with the<br />\nshow's subtle and sophisticated<br />\nconception. With his holloweyed stares and strange<br />\ngestures, such as his repeated<br />\nthumping of his forehead during the song \"Once in a<br />\nLifetime,\" he is undoubtedly<br />\nrock's most eccentric yet<br />\nmesmerizing singer. He is first<br />\nseen, or at least his white<br />\nsneakers are, wandering onto<br />\nstage alone to perform a bleak<br />\nyet rousing version of \"Psychokiller.\" The other members<br />\ncome onto the stage, one at a<br />\n<br />\ntime, each to a new song, as the<br />\nroad crew wanders about the<br />\nstage setting up each instrument<br />\nwithout detracting attention<br />\nfrom the performance. It is in<br />\nthe second part of the film that<br />\nthe show builds into an<br />\nelaborate production, which includes special lighting, Byrne's<br />\nBig Suit, and three screens set<br />\nup behind the band flashing<br />\nwords (like \"Air-Conditioner\u2014<br />\nUnder the Bed\u2014Drugs\"), as<br />\nwell as pictures of the members'<br />\nhands, backs, navels, and<br />\nbottoms.<br />\nByrne's casualness is matched by his fierce energy. His<br />\nstrangest gestures, such as darting his head back and forth<br />\nlike a lizard, and dancing with<br />\nstiff motions with an immobile<br />\ntorso, have a disconcerting yet<br />\ngalvanizing effect. The<br />\nenergetic and romantic quality<br />\nof his vocals, a change from the<br />\nconfused and paranoid vocals<br />\nof the band's earlier years, effect fine renditions of such<br />\nclassics as \"Once in a<br />\nLifetime,\" \"Life during Wartime,\" and \"Take Me to the<br />\nRiver.\"<br />\nMr. Demme avoids visual<br />\nmonotony, although the<br />\nbeautiful cinematography by<br />\nCronenwerth<br />\nJonathan<br />\nemploys slow, long, graceful<br />\nmovements of the camera. He<br />\ncaptures the band members at<br />\nclose-range without losing the<br />\noverall visual effects. The<br />\nlighting is more than satisfying,<br />\nquite a departure from the<br />\n<br />\nIf You Still Haven't<br />\nSeen This Movie...<br />\nby Lisa Asta<br />\nFew people have the two and<br />\na half hours-plus right now to<br />\nspend at the movies. Over the<br />\nupcoming break, however,<br />\nAmadeus is a must-see. After<br />\nall, its major theme is near and<br />\ndear to JHU: genius versus<br />\nthroat.<br />\nThe story, from Peter Shaffer's broadway play, is an intriguing historical \"what if.<br />\nIt places the incomparable<br />\nMozart and the common court<br />\ncomposer Antonio Salieri in the<br />\nsame town of Vienna for a<br />\nmusical showdown. This<br />\ntrumped-up rivalry works well<br />\nas a plot for a movie, or a play<br />\nfor that matter. Who cares<br />\nabout its direct disregard for<br />\nthe truth, as long as it<br />\nentertains?<br />\nSalieri, historically a very<br />\nminor Italian composer, would<br />\nhave sent the Mafia (if it existed<br />\nthen and could have set up<br />\noperations in Austria) after<br />\nMozart. His jealousy was that<br />\nintense. He sees talent as Godgiven and can't understand the<br />\nultimate deity's choice upon<br />\nwhom such gifts are bestowed.<br />\nWe can sort of see Salieri's<br />\npoint. The Mozart(Tom Hulce)<br />\n<br />\ngraininess and awkward quality of shots of past concert<br />\nfilms.<br />\nThe only problem in the film<br />\nis due to the structure of the<br />\nshow: it builds in momentum to<br />\na frenzy during the first part,<br />\nand then the band members<br />\ntake a twenty minute break.<br />\nThe film goes right to the second half, and the break is<br />\nsorely missed as a need to<br />\ndissipate the energy.<br />\nI saw this film in New York<br />\njust after it had opened.

In turn<br />\nthey inspired \"smarter\" bands<br />\nlike the Sex Pistols and the<br />\nDead Kennedys who took the<br />\nmusical and lyrical ironies to<br />\ntheir extremes. At any rate, a<br />\nRamones album has always<br />\n,been good for a laugh (though<br />\nit's been widely debated just<br />\nhow intentional a lot of the<br />\nhumor has been.) With the<br />\nrelease of Too Tough to Die all<br />\nthis has changed; the Ramones<br />\nhave turned serious.<br />\nThis newly found seriousness<br />\nis evident in a number of ways.<br />\nFirst of all, the \"I wanna be<br />\nSedated\" joke songs have been<br />\nreplaced by songs about heroin<br />\naddicts (\"Wart Hog\") and<br />\nnuclear war (\"Planet Earth<br />\n1988\").

I'm convinced that any one of these four<br />\nsongs could do very well on<br />\ncommercial radio. In addition,<br />\nthe Ramones have been blessed with their best production<br />\never, courtesy of ex-drummer<br />\nTommy (Ramone) Erdelyi.<br />\nOne of the most remarkable<br />\ndevelopments, however, is the<br />\ngrowth of Joey Ramone into a<br />\nreal singer.

His voice varies from<br />\na deep bass reminiscent of Billy Idol or Iggy Pop to a genuinely maniacal voice on<br />\ntracks like \"Endless Vacation.\"<br />\nFurthermore, he is far more expressive than he's ever been;<br />\nthere is a real snarl to his voice<br />\non \"Howling at the Moon.\"<br />\nSo what does all this<br />\nseriousness get us?

The victory was the<br />\nJays' first of the season and<br />\nserved as a \"real confidence<br />\nbuilder\" according to head<br />\ncoach \"Nap\" Doherty.<br />\nThe Blue Jays' seasonal<br />\nrecord fell to 1-4 with a 72-64<br />\nloss to Washington University<br />\nin the championship game of<br />\nthe tournament last Saturday,<br />\nand a 107-97 defeat at the<br />\nhands of a tough Cabrini squad<br />\non Tuesday.<br />\nSteve Mitchell(36 points, 24<br />\nrebounds) and junior forward<br />\nMike Kowatch (21 points, 8 rebounds,8 steals) were named to<br />\nthe all-tournament team for the<br />\ntwo game series played at<br />\nWashington University. Their<br />\nstrong play has sparked optimism in Coach Doherty's<br />\noutlook for the rest of the<br />\nseason.<br />\n\"I've been extremely impressed with the play of<br />\nKowatch and Mitchell thus<br />\nfar,\" the Coach remarked.<br />\n\"We're beginning to get<br />\n<br />\nbalanced scoring on offense,<br />\nand with further improvements<br />\nin our ball handling skills and<br />\noffensive rebounding, we<br />\nshould be more successful over<br />\nthe course of the season.\"<br />\nPlaying four of its first five<br />\ncontests on the road, being<br />\nplagued by a rash of injuries,<br />\nand suffering from inexperience, the Blue Jays have<br />\nfound themselves at a distinct<br />\ndisadvantage in the early going<br />\nof the season. Coach Doherty<br />\nfeels that the experimental process of identifying the team's<br />\nstrengths and finding the best<br />\nplayer combinations has led to<br />\na squad that improves with successive games.<br />\n\"We haven't played as a unit<br />\nvery long, but the experience we<br />\nnow have should give us an extra dimension,\" he noted. \"The<br />\nplayers have really hustled and<br />\nscrapped in the last few games.<br />\nOur presses looked good<br />\nagainst Cabrini, and I think<br />\nwe'll be a contender in the<br />\nleague once we cut down on<br />\nthings like turnovers and poor<br />\nfree throw shooting.\"<br />\nDespite getting double figure<br />\nscoring from three players, the<br />\nJays were unable to keep up<br />\nwith a strong Cabrini team, as<br />\nthey bowed 107-97. Cabrini<br />\n(6-1) which played in the<br />\nNCAA tournament last year,<br />\n<br />\nwas helped by Jim Walden,<br />\nwho chipped in 30 points, and<br />\nan overwhelming total of 25<br />\nBlue Jay turnovers.<br />\nSteve Mitchell tallied a<br />\nseason high 25 points and 14 rebounds, while Mike Kowatch<br />\nand captain Ken Puhala each<br />\ncontributed 14 points. Hopkins' inability to box out their<br />\nopponent and poor ball handling proved to be the tell-tale<br />\nfactor in the contest.<br />\n\"They were much stronger<br />\noff the boards and quicker than<br />\nwe were,\" noted Doherty. \"We<br />\ndidn't move the ball well at all.<br />\nWe had chances to beat them,<br />\nbut sloppy ball handling and<br />\nturnovers kept us out of the<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays played<br />\nLebanon Valley last night, but<br />\nthe score was unavailable at<br />\npress time. The team has the<br />\nrest of the month off, and will<br />\nsuit up next for the Blue Jay<br />\nTournament on January 4 and<br />\n5<br />\nCoach Doherty expects that<br />\nhis team is over its transition<br />\nperiod and will begin to play up<br />\nto its potential over the next 17<br />\ngames. \"The Christmas break<br />\nshould give us the time to heal<br />\nour injuries, and get in top<br />\nform,\" Doherty remarked.<br />\n\"We've continually improved<br />\nand the season should turn out<br />\n<br />\nto be a successful one.\"<br />\nBlue Jay Dribblings: Steve Mitchell leads the Blue Jays in scoring and rebounding with 19.8<br />\npoints and 12.2 rebounds per<br />\ngame. Mike Kowatch is second<br />\nin scoring with an 11.2 average,<br />\n<br />\nand captain Ken Puhala is third<br />\nwith a 9.1 average. Sophomore<br />\nguard Mike Sohr leads the team<br />\nin assists with 15.

But by the end<br />\nof the first half, they were<br />\ndown by 22 points. Head<br />\nCoach Kay Fowler-Dressler attributed this to a \"first-half<br />\nlapse\" on the part of her team.<br />\nThe Hopkins women fought<br />\nhard in the second half, matching Dickinson point by point,<br />\nbut were unable to recover<br />\nfrom the first half.<br />\nFreshman Cindy Harper was<br />\nthe high scorer for the game,<br />\nbringing home 29 out of the 52<br />\nHopkins points. Freshman<br />\nLaura Porter also played well,<br />\nbut suffered too many turnovers. Senior co-captain<br />\nDawn Richards, usually a high<br />\nscorer, had a rough game, converting all 3 foul shots but only 2 of 16 baskets.<br />\nCoach Fowler-Dressler says<br />\nthat the team is looking forward to meeting Dickinson on<br />\nthe court again. She predicts<br />\nthat the team will remain strong<br />\non the offense, and with work,<br />\ncan improve their defense. \"I<br />\nthink we're going to have a<br />\nreally good year,\" commented<br />\n<br />\njunior co-captain Joan Sanford, \"thanks to the<br />\nnewcomers and the strength of<br />\nthe oldtimers, the team has<br />\ngrown in size and potential.\"<br />\nHopkins fared much better<br />\nlast Thursday night when they<br />\nscored a walloping victory over<br />\nGoucher at Homewood. The<br />\n-nly surprising feature of the<br />\n62-24 win was the enormity of<br />\nthe point spread. \"With conference games coming up we<br />\nreally needed a game like this to<br />\ngive us that winning feeling,\"<br />\nremarked Coach FowlerDressler.<br />\nGoucher led off by scoring<br />\nthe first basket of the game.<br />\nBut Hopkins starters freshman<br />\nJeanne Clark and Suzy Young,<br />\nsophomore Rachelle La Force,<br />\nHarper and Richards easily had<br />\nthe game under control. Good<br />\ndefense on the part of Hopkins<br />\noverwhelmed the Goucher<br />\nwomen and allowed only 10<br />\npoints in the first half. Other<br />\nfirst half highlights included accurate foul shooting by Harper<br />\nand Richards. Junior Joan<br />\nBartlett managed to foil many<br />\nGoucher passes with some nice<br />\ndefense.<br />\nCoach Fowler-Dressler was<br />\ngrateful for the 41-10 lead<br />\nHopkins had going into the second half. It meant that all of<br />\nher players would get time on<br />\nthe court. Not only did<br />\neveryone get to play, every<br />\nplayer scored at least once! She<br />\n<br />\nalso implemented an unusual<br />\npolicy during the second half.<br />\nIf a player made one mistake on<br />\nthe court, a sub was immediately sent in. When asked about<br />\nthis policy, the Coach responded that it \"certainly is not my<br />\nusual style, but this was an excellent opportunity for the<br />\nplayers to strive for good<br />\ndiscipline on the court.\"<br />\nFancy footwork by the<br />\nHopkins crew combined with<br />\nsome sloppy playing by<br />\nGoucher added 41 points to the<br />\nHopkins' score. Although<br />\nusually the stronger team,<br />\nHopkins has never had this<br />\nscoring power over Goucher in<br />\npast seasons. According to<br />\nCoach Fowler-Dressler, \"Our<br />\ndefense was really on.\" \"It was<br />\nan important game for us since<br />\neveryone got the chance to<br />\nscore,\" added Bartlett.<br />\nThe team is happy to<br />\naboard<br />\nwelcome<br />\nsome<br />\nassistants this year. Sandra<br />\nBond,considered a \"godsend\"<br />\nby Coach Fowler-Dressler, is<br />\nthe Assistant Manager. Sharon<br />\nLivingston joins the team as<br />\nManager. The Coach is glad to<br />\nhave such good help on the<br />\nbench, especially with tomorrow's home game against<br />\nFranklin and Marshall coming<br />\nup.

The<br />\nwinless Jays' slide has now hit<br />\nfive games.<br />\nThe Blue Jays travelled to<br />\nFrederick Community College<br />\nTuesday for a rematch of the<br />\nseason's lopsided opener, and<br />\nproved to be more difficult prey<br />\nfor the talented Cougars this<br />\ntime. In what may well have<br />\nbeen their best effort to date,<br />\nthe Jays gave Frederick quite a<br />\nbattle, as evidenced by the<br />\n26-18 halftime score. The Jays<br />\n, showed improved defense and<br />\nrebounding throughout both<br />\nhalves.<br />\nAnything positive gained<br />\nfrom the Frederick game disappeared when Hopkins faced<br />\nPenn State-York on Thursday.<br />\nPlagued by numerous fouls and<br />\nBill Wallace turnovers,<br />\nthe hoopsters turnBarry Shocket prepares to inbound the ball.<br />\ned in a dismal performance in<br />\n<br />\nwhat seemed to be an evenly<br />\nmatched contest.

Several players agreed<br />\nthat \"Dundalk is the best team<br />\nwe've ever faced.\"<br />\nSome consolation can be<br />\ntaken from the fact that<br />\nhighly talented Dundalk was<br />\nheld to double figures.

The Olympics will<br />\nstart in January and continue<br />\nthroughout next semester.<br />\nThe first event will be the<br />\nSulfanilamide 500. Contestants<br />\nwill be required to synthesize<br />\ntheir sulfanilamide in the<br />\nlaboratory, pour it into a teaspoon and run 500 meters<br />\nholding the spoon between their<br />\nteeth. The winner will be determined by multiplying place<br />\nfinished times the weight of<br />\nsulfanilamide remaining on the<br />\nspoon after the race times the<br />\npurity of the runner's sweat.<br />\nThe second event will be the<br />\nDiethyl Decathalon. Each team<br />\nwill be locked in Remsen 101<br />\nand asked to draw the<br />\nmechanism for the synthesis of<br />\ndiethyl adipate using as many<br />\nof the nine blackboards as<br />\npossible. The winning team will<br />\nbe the one which makes use of<br />\nthe most blackboards, while at<br />\nthe same time presents the least<br />\ncoherent mechanism.<br />\nThe third event will b,e the<br />\nDiene Dash. Participants will<br />\nbe given 1,1,6,6-Tetraphenyl1,6-hexanediol and must<br />\n<br />\ndehydrate it in order to produce<br />\n1 , 1 ,6,6-Tetraphenyl1,5-hexadiene. The event will<br />\nhave a time limit of two weeks.<br />\nThe winner will be the contestant producing the most crops.<br />\nBonus points will be awarded to anyone who breaks the<br />\nall-time Olympic record in this<br />\nprestigious event. The record<br />\nfor the most crops was set in<br />\n1982 by Phil Kwait, whose 57<br />\ncrops overturned the previous<br />\nrecord of 56, held by Joe<br />\nDiMaggio.<br />\nThe final event of the<br />\nOrganic Olympics will be the<br />\nPhotochemistry Finish. Each<br />\ncompetitor will be placed under<br />\nthe sun lamp along with his<br />\ncyclopentadiene benzoquinone<br />\nadduct. The object of the event<br />\nis for the contestant to remain<br />\nunder the sun lamp until all of<br />\nhis adduct has reacted.<br />\nIf the contestant steps out<br />\nfrom under the lamp before the<br />\nreaction is completed, he is disqualified. If the contestant catches fire, the TAs will cool him<br />\nimmediately in an ice bath. No<br />\none has ever made it through<br />\nthis grueling event, but all are<br />\nwelcome to try.<br />\nThe BIA, in conjunction<br />\nwith the Department of<br />\nChemistry, also announced the<br />\ncreation of a pilot project: BIA<br />\nCraps.<br />\n<br />\nEach participant in BIA<br />\nCraps will represent a freshman<br />\ntaking Introductory Chemistry<br />\nLaboratory 3.1-3.2. The results<br />\nof the craps competition will<br />\nthen be used to determine the<br />\nIntro Chem Lab students'<br />\ngrades.<br />\nThe BIA and Department of<br />\nChemistry expect over 90\u00b0Ai of<br />\nthe student body to participate<br />\nin the Craps Tournament. If<br />\nenrollment is insufficient, the<br />\nevent coordinators are planning<br />\nto pass a rule forcing all<br />\nstudents who do not participate<br />\nto become TAs for the Intro<br />\nChem Lab.<br />\nTwo men, Draino Coward<br />\namd Steve Yeager have been<br />\nnamed Co-chairmen of the<br />\nOrganic Olympics.<br />\nThe Olympics are slated to be<br />\nheld on ten consecutive Saturdays, beginning in January.<br />\n\"They're scheduled from 1:00<br />\nto 4:00 each day, but we'll<br />\nstretch them out to 8:00,\" said<br />\nMr. Coward. \"I'm sure the<br />\nhave<br />\nathletes<br />\nother<br />\nengagements, but we don't<br />\ncare.\"<br />\nThis article is among the last<br />\nworks of a deranged sports<br />\neditor, and it is meant to be<br />\ntaken in jest.

Of course you can<br />\n<br />\nalways run stairs or something<br />\ncrazy like that, but you're a<br />\nweightlifter now, not a runner.<br />\nThe calf press on the Universal<br />\nLeg Machine is the only real option. Five to ten sets (depending<br />\non how much time you have)of<br />\nten reps each to exhaustion,<br />\nshould add a few slabs of muscle anyway.<br />\n<br />\nspecified. One hundred situps<br />\nand leglifts should be included<br />\nevery other day to decrease<br />\nchances of abdominal pulls and<br />\nhernias. Move up in weight<br />\nwhen you can perform your<br />\nfirst set for one more rep than<br />\nI recommend. Rest periods are<br />\nbasically up to you, but I endorse a one to two minute interval for back exercises, three<br />\nto four minutes for legs, and<br />\nFinal Note:<br />\nIn all the programs discussed, two to three minutes for chest<br />\nexercises are to be performed to exercises.<br />\nexhaustion unless otherwise<br />\n<br />\ned it.\"<br />\nDespite the 0-5 record, team<br />\nmorale has not suffered.<br />\nRealizing the difficulty of its<br />\nschedule, the team and the<br />\ncoaching staff have been able to<br />\nkeep things in perspective.<br />\n\"All that we ask from<br />\nourselves is to play our best,\"<br />\nsaid Hamdan. \"We look forward to playing some teams of<br />\nequal ability.\"<br />\nThis week provided the first<br />\nglimpse of the inside of a prison<br />\nfor most of the Jays as they<br />\ntravelled to Camp Hill on<br />\nWednesday.

Citing a new study, \"Involvement in Learning: Realizing the Potential of American<br />\nHigher Education\", he says<br />\nthat a fifth year may be needed<br />\nin certain undergraduate programs to arrest the \"increasingly early encroachment of professionalism into liberal arts.\"<br />\nWhile such a move might mean<br />\nadditional burdens on student<br />\nfinances, he adds,\"We need to<br />\nhave broadly educated men and<br />\nwomen\" if the United States is<br />\nto maintain its standing in the<br />\nworld.<br />\nBut extra semesters offer no<br />\nassurances that they'll be wellspent. As Bell well knows, it's<br />\nquality \u2014 not quantity \u2014 that<br />\ncounts. Students are already<br />\nconfused about the value of<br />\nliberal arts; if the five-year plan<br />\nis to receive official sanction,<br />\neducators will need to clarify<br />\nthe ambiguities.<br />\nUndergraduate America's<br />\ngradual abandonment of the<br />\nhumanities is an open sore. As<br />\n\"Involvement in Learning\"<br />\npoints out, the share of<br />\nbachelor's degrees awarded in<br />\nprofessional or vocational programs rose from about half to<br />\nalmost two-thirds between 1971<br />\nand 1982. Freshmen aren't even<br />\ngoing for the life sciences as<br />\nthey used to; not coincidentally, degrees in business administration and engineering<br />\nenjoy a healthy demand.<br />\nComputer science and electrical engineering, for example,<br />\nare so hot at the Massachusetts<br /><br />\nInstitute of Technology that the<br />\nschool may have to trim enrollment in both programs. OneM.I.T.'s<br />\nof<br />\nfourth<br />\nundergraduate student body<br />\nhas signed on with the electrical<br />\nengineering department.<br />\nMeanwhile, a mastery of the<br />\nhistory,<br />\nhumanities<br />\n\u2014<br />\ngeography,<br />\nlanguages,<br />\nliterature, etc. \u2014 appears more<br />\nneeded than ever. According to<br />\n\"Involvement in Learning,\"<br />\nscores in 11 of 15 categories of<br />\nthe Graduate Record Examinations declined between 1964<br />\nand 1982.<br /><br />\nMaxwell<br /><br />\nlen<br />\nCody<br />\nhearer<br />\nEvery professor has his or<br />\nher own horror story. But one<br />\nof the more astounding comes<br />\nfrom a geography prof at<br />\nCalifornia State University at<br />\nFullerton, who recently found<br />\nthat three-fourths of his<br />\nfreshman class couldn't locate<br />\nEl Salvador. Fewer than half of<br />\nhis students even knew where<br />\nAtlanta was; many confused<br />\nJapan with New Zealand.<br />\nThe seven authors of \"Involvement in Learning\" suggest<br />\nthat two full years of liberal arts<br />\neducation would help to<br />\nalleviate such ignorance. One<br />\nmember of the panel, Zelda<br />\nGamson, of the University of<br />\nMichigan, adds another incentive: Since, on the average, people change jobs at least five<br />\ntimes before their 40th birthday, \"liberal arts provide<br />\n(them) with a range of skills<br /><br />\n1111<br /><br />\nand attitudes that help them in<br />\nall aspects of their lives.\"<br />\nSome students would hardly<br />\nnotice the shift. Several<br />\nschools, in fact (among them<br />\nWilliams College and M.I.T.),<br />\nhave jointly run professional<br />\nprograms of five or more years<br />\nsince the 1950's, according to<br />\nPresident Mark Curtis of the<br />\nAmerican Association of<br />\nColleges.<br />\nBut a five-year program in<br />\nadministration,<br />\nbusiness<br />\nengineering and other professions would, if initiated at most<br />\ncolleges and universities, invite<br />\npredictably skeptical<br />\na<br />\nresponse. How, for example,<br />\ndo you assume an aspiring<br />\nDavid Packard that an extra<br />\nyear of Kierkegaard and Hemingway will give him a<br />\nreasonable rate of return on the<br />\n$5,000 or more it will cost?<br />\nYou can't \u2014 with much ease,<br />\nat least \u2014 stretch the economic<br />\nbenefits too far.

It looks and<br />\nsounds like no other, and owes<br />\nvery little to the rock-film making formulas of the past. The<br />\nsound is crisp and clear, thanks<br />\nto the pioneering use of<br />\n24-track digital recording. The<br />\nvisual style of this live performance is as precise, yet as<br />\nanomalous, as the Talking<br />\nHeads themselves. From the<br />\nopening image\u2014the shadow of<br />\na guitar neck looming against a<br />\nwhite wall\u2014Mr. Demme<br />\ndemonstrates that he is very<br />\nwell attuned to the racially and<br />\nsexually integrated band's oddities, which make their performance unlike anything that one<br />\nwould find in the standard concert film.<br />\nThe focus of the performance is lead singer David<br />\nByrne, who is credited with the<br />\nshow's subtle and sophisticated<br />\nconception. With his holloweyed stares and strange<br />\ngestures, such as his repeated<br />\nthumping of his forehead during the song \"Once in a<br />\nLifetime,\" he is undoubtedly<br />\nrock's most eccentric yet<br />\nmesmerizing singer. He is first<br />\nseen, or at least his white<br />\nsneakers are, wandering onto<br />\nstage alone to perform a bleak<br />\nyet rousing version of \"Psychokiller.\" The other members<br />\ncome onto the stage, one at a<br /><br />\ntime, each to a new song, as the<br />\nroad crew wanders about the<br />\nstage setting up each instrument<br />\nwithout detracting attention<br />\nfrom the performance. It is in<br />\nthe second part of the film that<br />\nthe show builds into an<br />\nelaborate production, which includes special lighting, Byrne's<br />\nBig Suit, and three screens set<br />\nup behind the band flashing<br />\nwords (like \"Air-Conditioner\u2014<br />\nUnder the Bed\u2014Drugs\"), as<br />\nwell as pictures of the members'<br />\nhands, backs, navels, and<br />\nbottoms.<br />\nByrne's casualness is matched by his fierce energy. His<br />\nstrangest gestures, such as darting his head back and forth<br />\nlike a lizard, and dancing with<br />\nstiff motions with an immobile<br />\ntorso, have a disconcerting yet<br />\ngalvanizing effect. The<br />\nenergetic and romantic quality<br />\nof his vocals, a change from the<br />\nconfused and paranoid vocals<br />\nof the band's earlier years, effect fine renditions of such<br />\nclassics as \"Once in a<br />\nLifetime,\" \"Life during Wartime,\" and \"Take Me to the<br />\nRiver.\"<br />\nMr. Demme avoids visual<br />\nmonotony, although the<br />\nbeautiful cinematography by<br />\nCronenwerth<br />\nJonathan<br />\nemploys slow, long, graceful<br />\nmovements of the camera. He<br />\ncaptures the band members at<br />\nclose-range without losing the<br />\noverall visual effects. The<br />\nlighting is more than satisfying,<br />\nquite a departure from the<br /><br />\nIf You Still Haven't<br />\nSeen This Movie...<br />\nby Lisa Asta<br />\nFew people have the two and<br />\na half hours-plus right now to<br />\nspend at the movies.

In turn<br />\nthey inspired \"smarter\" bands<br />\nlike the Sex Pistols and the<br />\nDead Kennedys who took the<br />\nmusical and lyrical ironies to<br />\ntheir extremes. At any rate, a<br />\nRamones album has always<br />\n,been good for a laugh (though<br />\nit's been widely debated just<br />\nhow intentional a lot of the<br />\nhumor has been.)

I'm convinced that any one of these four<br />\nsongs could do very well on<br />\ncommercial radio. In addition,<br />\nthe Ramones have been blessed with their best production<br />\never, courtesy of ex-drummer<br />\nTommy (Ramone) Erdelyi.<br />\nOne of the most remarkable<br />\ndevelopments, however, is the<br />\ngrowth of Joey Ramone into a<br />\nreal singer.

The victory was the<br />\nJays' first of the season and<br />\nserved as a \"real confidence<br />\nbuilder\" according to head<br />\ncoach \"Nap\" Doherty.<br />\nThe Blue Jays' seasonal<br />\nrecord fell to 1-4 with a 72-64<br />\nloss to Washington University<br />\nin the championship game of<br />\nthe tournament last Saturday,<br />\nand a 107-97 defeat at the<br />\nhands of a tough Cabrini squad<br />\non Tuesday.<br />\nSteve Mitchell(36 points, 24<br />\nrebounds) and junior forward<br />\nMike Kowatch (21 points, 8 rebounds,8 steals) were named to<br />\nthe all-tournament team for the<br />\ntwo game series played at<br />\nWashington University. Their<br />\nstrong play has sparked optimism in Coach Doherty's<br />\noutlook for the rest of the<br />\nseason.<br />\n\"I've been extremely impressed with the play of<br />\nKowatch and Mitchell thus<br />\nfar,\" the Coach remarked.<br />\n\"We're beginning to get<br /><br />\nbalanced scoring on offense,<br />\nand with further improvements<br />\nin our ball handling skills and<br />\noffensive rebounding, we<br />\nshould be more successful over<br />\nthe course of the season.\"<br />\nPlaying four of its first five<br />\ncontests on the road, being<br />\nplagued by a rash of injuries,<br />\nand suffering from inexperience, the Blue Jays have<br />\nfound themselves at a distinct<br />\ndisadvantage in the early going<br />\nof the season. Coach Doherty<br />\nfeels that the experimental process of identifying the team's<br />\nstrengths and finding the best<br />\nplayer combinations has led to<br />\na squad that improves with successive games.<br />\n\"We haven't played as a unit<br />\nvery long, but the experience we<br />\nnow have should give us an extra dimension,\" he noted. \"The<br />\nplayers have really hustled and<br />\nscrapped in the last few games.<br />\nOur presses looked good<br />\nagainst Cabrini, and I think<br />\nwe'll be a contender in the<br />\nleague once we cut down on<br />\nthings like turnovers and poor<br />\nfree throw shooting.\"<br />\nDespite getting double figure<br />\nscoring from three players, the<br />\nJays were unable to keep up<br />\nwith a strong Cabrini team, as<br />\nthey bowed 107-97. Cabrini<br />\n(6-1) which played in the<br />\nNCAA tournament last year,<br /><br />\nwas helped by Jim Walden,<br />\nwho chipped in 30 points, and<br />\nan overwhelming total of 25<br />\nBlue Jay turnovers.<br />\nSteve Mitchell tallied a<br />\nseason high 25 points and 14 rebounds, while Mike Kowatch<br />\nand captain Ken Puhala each<br />\ncontributed 14 points. Hopkins' inability to box out their<br />\nopponent and poor ball handling proved to be the tell-tale<br />\nfactor in the contest.<br />\n\"They were much stronger<br />\noff the boards and quicker than<br />\nwe were,\" noted Doherty. \"We<br />\ndidn't move the ball well at all.<br />\nWe had chances to beat them,<br />\nbut sloppy ball handling and<br />\nturnovers kept us out of the<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays played<br />\nLebanon Valley last night, but<br />\nthe score was unavailable at<br />\npress time.

But by the end<br />\nof the first half, they were<br />\ndown by 22 points. Head<br />\nCoach Kay Fowler-Dressler attributed this to a \"first-half<br />\nlapse\" on the part of her team.<br />\nThe Hopkins women fought<br />\nhard in the second half, matching Dickinson point by point,<br />\nbut were unable to recover<br />\nfrom the first half.<br />\nFreshman Cindy Harper was<br />\nthe high scorer for the game,<br />\nbringing home 29 out of the 52<br />\nHopkins points. Freshman<br />\nLaura Porter also played well,<br />\nbut suffered too many turnovers. Senior co-captain<br />\nDawn Richards, usually a high<br />\nscorer, had a rough game, converting all 3 foul shots but only 2 of 16 baskets.<br />\nCoach Fowler-Dressler says<br />\nthat the team is looking forward to meeting Dickinson on<br />\nthe court again. She predicts<br />\nthat the team will remain strong<br />\non the offense, and with work,<br />\ncan improve their defense. \"I<br />\nthink we're going to have a<br />\nreally good year,\" commented<br /><br />\njunior co-captain Joan Sanford, \"thanks to the<br />\nnewcomers and the strength of<br />\nthe oldtimers, the team has<br />\ngrown in size and potential.\"<br />\nHopkins fared much better<br />\nlast Thursday night when they<br />\nscored a walloping victory over<br />\nGoucher at Homewood. The<br />\n-nly surprising feature of the<br />\n62-24 win was the enormity of<br />\nthe point spread. \"With conference games coming up we<br />\nreally needed a game like this to<br />\ngive us that winning feeling,\"<br />\nremarked Coach FowlerDressler.<br />\nGoucher led off by scoring<br />\nthe first basket of the game.<br />\nBut Hopkins starters freshman<br />\nJeanne Clark and Suzy Young,<br />\nsophomore Rachelle La Force,<br />\nHarper and Richards easily had<br />\nthe game under control. Good<br />\ndefense on the part of Hopkins<br />\noverwhelmed the Goucher<br />\nwomen and allowed only 10<br />\npoints in the first half. Other<br />\nfirst half highlights included accurate foul shooting by Harper<br />\nand Richards. Junior Joan<br />\nBartlett managed to foil many<br />\nGoucher passes with some nice<br />\ndefense.<br />\nCoach Fowler-Dressler was<br />\ngrateful for the 41-10 lead<br />\nHopkins had going into the second half. It meant that all of<br />\nher players would get time on<br />\nthe court. Not only did<br />\neveryone get to play, every<br />\nplayer scored at least once! She<br /><br />\nalso implemented an unusual<br />\npolicy during the second half.<br />\nIf a player made one mistake on<br />\nthe court, a sub was immediately sent in. When asked about<br />\nthis policy, the Coach responded that it \"certainly is not my<br />\nusual style, but this was an excellent opportunity for the<br />\nplayers to strive for good<br />\ndiscipline on the court.\"<br />\nFancy footwork by the<br />\nHopkins crew combined with<br />\nsome sloppy playing by<br />\nGoucher added 41 points to the<br />\nHopkins' score. Although<br />\nusually the stronger team,<br />\nHopkins has never had this<br />\nscoring power over Goucher in<br />\npast seasons. According to<br />\nCoach Fowler-Dressler, \"Our<br />\ndefense was really on.\" \"It was<br />\nan important game for us since<br />\neveryone got the chance to<br />\nscore,\" added Bartlett.<br />\nThe team is happy to<br />\naboard<br />\nwelcome<br />\nsome<br />\nassistants this year. Sandra<br />\nBond,considered a \"godsend\"<br />\nby Coach Fowler-Dressler, is<br />\nthe Assistant Manager. Sharon<br />\nLivingston joins the team as<br />\nManager. The Coach is glad to<br />\nhave such good help on the<br />\nbench, especially with tomorrow's home game against<br />\nFranklin and Marshall coming<br />\nup.

Eight to nine<br />\nrepetitions is the maximum.<br />\nWhen you reach nine reps on<br />\nyour first set, the time has come<br />\nto move up five more pounds<br />\non your next benching day.<br />\nFollowing your first set of eight<br />\nreps, increase the weight by five<br />\npounds and press at least five to<br />\nsix reps. Continue this process<br />\n(adding five pounds and dropping reps) until you can bench<br />\nonly one rep (hopefully you've<br />\ncompleted five to six sets). In<br />\nthe bench press, never bounce<br />\nthe bar off your chest (tap it<br />\noff) or arch your back.<br />\nAlthough incline bench press<br />\nshould follow flat bench press,<br />\nthe Universal Weight Room<br />\ndoes not provide such amenities<br />\nas an incline bench. If you have Day Two and Five: Pulling<br />\naccess to the Varsity Weight Muscles<br /><br />\nCirasp a dumbell, that you<br />\ncan comfortably curl for eight<br />\nreps, in each hand. Alternating<br />\nbetween hands, curl the<br />\ndumbells, without any back<br />\nassistance, for four sets.<br />\nDay Three and Six: Legs and<br />\nLower Back<br />\n1. Squats:<br />\nConsiderable stretching is<br />\nmandatory before the squat.<br />\nDeep knee bends, crotch stretches, and toe touches number<br />\namong the best. A warmup set<br />\nwith light weight is also a prerequisite. My squat program contrasts strongly with my other<br />\nexercises due to the potentially<br />\ndangerous nature of the exercise. However, if performed<br />\nproperly, the squat is perfectly<br />\nsafe and provides extraordinary<br />\npower to the thigh muscles.<br />\nAfter your warmup set,<br />\nsquat ten reps with a relatively<br />\ncomfortable weight (this set<br />\nshould be very close to exhaustion). Then move up ten<br />\nto twenty pounds, and squat at<br />\nleast eight reps to exhaustion.<br />\nThen add ten more pounds and<br />\nsquat five reps to exhaustion.<br />\nNow comes the fun part.<br />\nLighten the load by twenty<br />\npounds, and perform three sets<br />\nof five reps each. These last<br />\nthree sets should be particularly deep with impeccable form.<br /><br />\n5.

The<br />\nwinless Jays' slide has now hit<br />\nfive games.<br />\nThe Blue Jays travelled to<br />\nFrederick Community College<br />\nTuesday for a rematch of the<br />\nseason's lopsided opener, and<br />\nproved to be more difficult prey<br />\nfor the talented Cougars this<br />\ntime. In what may well have<br />\nbeen their best effort to date,<br />\nthe Jays gave Frederick quite a<br />\nbattle, as evidenced by the<br />\n26-18 halftime score.

Several players agreed<br />\nthat \"Dundalk is the best team<br />\nwe've ever faced.\"<br />\nSome consolation can be<br />\ntaken from the fact that<br />\nhighly talented Dundalk was<br />\nheld to double figures.

The Olympics will<br />\nstart in January and continue<br />\nthroughout next semester.<br />\nThe first event will be the<br />\nSulfanilamide 500. Contestants<br />\nwill be required to synthesize<br />\ntheir sulfanilamide in the<br />\nlaboratory, pour it into a teaspoon and run 500 meters<br />\nholding the spoon between their<br />\nteeth. The winner will be determined by multiplying place<br />\nfinished times the weight of<br />\nsulfanilamide remaining on the<br />\nspoon after the race times the<br />\npurity of the runner's sweat.<br />\nThe second event will be the<br />\nDiethyl Decathalon. Each team<br />\nwill be locked in Remsen 101<br />\nand asked to draw the<br />\nmechanism for the synthesis of<br />\ndiethyl adipate using as many<br />\nof the nine blackboards as<br />\npossible. The winning team will<br />\nbe the one which makes use of<br />\nthe most blackboards, while at<br />\nthe same time presents the least<br />\ncoherent mechanism.<br />\nThe third event will b,e the<br />\nDiene Dash. Participants will<br />\nbe given 1,1,6,6-Tetraphenyl1,6-hexanediol and must<br /><br />\ndehydrate it in order to produce<br />\n1 , 1 ,6,6-Tetraphenyl1,5-hexadiene. The event will<br />\nhave a time limit of two weeks.<br />\nThe winner will be the contestant producing the most crops.<br />\nBonus points will be awarded to anyone who breaks the<br />\nall-time Olympic record in this<br />\nprestigious event. The record<br />\nfor the most crops was set in<br />\n1982 by Phil Kwait, whose 57<br />\ncrops overturned the previous<br />\nrecord of 56, held by Joe<br />\nDiMaggio.<br />\nThe final event of the<br />\nOrganic Olympics will be the<br />\nPhotochemistry Finish. Each<br />\ncompetitor will be placed under<br />\nthe sun lamp along with his<br />\ncyclopentadiene benzoquinone<br />\nadduct. The object of the event<br />\nis for the contestant to remain<br />\nunder the sun lamp until all of<br />\nhis adduct has reacted.<br />\nIf the contestant steps out<br />\nfrom under the lamp before the<br />\nreaction is completed, he is disqualified. If the contestant catches fire, the TAs will cool him<br />\nimmediately in an ice bath. No<br />\none has ever made it through<br />\nthis grueling event, but all are<br />\nwelcome to try.<br />\nThe BIA, in conjunction<br />\nwith the Department of<br />\nChemistry, also announced the<br />\ncreation of a pilot project: BIA<br />\nCraps.<br /><br />\nEach participant in BIA<br />\nCraps will represent a freshman<br />\ntaking Introductory Chemistry<br />\nLaboratory 3.1-3.2. The results<br />\nof the craps competition will<br />\nthen be used to determine the<br />\nIntro Chem Lab students'<br />\ngrades.<br />\nThe BIA and Department of<br />\nChemistry expect over 90\u00b0Ai of<br />\nthe student body to participate<br />\nin the Craps Tournament. If<br />\nenrollment is insufficient, the<br />\nevent coordinators are planning<br />\nto pass a rule forcing all<br />\nstudents who do not participate<br />\nto become TAs for the Intro<br />\nChem Lab.<br />\nTwo men, Draino Coward<br />\namd Steve Yeager have been<br />\nnamed Co-chairmen of the<br />\nOrganic Olympics.<br />\nThe Olympics are slated to be<br />\nheld on ten consecutive Saturdays, beginning in January.<br />\n\"They're scheduled from 1:00<br />\nto 4:00 each day, but we'll<br />\nstretch them out to 8:00,\" said<br />\nMr. Coward. \"I'm sure the<br />\nhave<br />\nathletes<br />\nother<br />\nengagements, but we don't<br />\ncare.\"<br />\nThis article is among the last<br />\nworks of a deranged sports<br />\neditor, and it is meant to be<br />\ntaken in jest.

One hundred situps<br />\nand leglifts should be included<br />\nevery other day to decrease<br />\nchances of abdominal pulls and<br />\nhernias. Move up in weight<br />\nwhen you can perform your<br />\nfirst set for one more rep than<br />\nI recommend.
