Sutton accounted for the first goal of the second half when he came from behind<br />\nthe goal and shot. The Blue Jays protested that he had scored from the<br />\ninside of the crease but the officials<br />\ndenied it. Thereupon the losers secured two more points in quick order,<br />\none by Kaufman on a pass from Melvin, and one by Himes, also fed by<br />\nMelvin, while a Mt.

On Friday it lost by a 15-5<br />\nscore to the Drexel Institute diamonders, while on the following day it<br />\nwas nosed out by Swarthmore College in a free-hitting contest that<br />\nended with the Jays at the short end<br />\nof a 12-8 score.<br />\nDrexel Scores First<br />\nThe Drexel team wasted no time in<br />\nthe scoring of runs by piling up a<br />\n3-0 lead before the Blue team could<br />\nmuster enough power to score. It was<br />\nin the third inning that the Hopkins<br />\nboys came to life and pushed across<br />\nthree runs to tie up the count. In the<br />\nfourth inning the Jays took the lead<br />\nby scoring one run and then adding<br />\nto their lead with another tally in<br />\nthe fifth stanza.<br />\nBy scoring a run in the fifth inning,<br />\nthe Drexel nine started what proved<br />\nto be the downfall of the Hopkins lead<br />\nand victory. In the following frame<br />\nthey scored no less than seven runs<br />\nwhich was brought about mainly by<br />\nthe errors of the Blue Jay infield and<br />\nthe temporary let-up of Pitcher Mur-<br />\n<br />\nray Scheff. Again in the eight inning the Jays displayed the same<br />\nragged playing that brought about<br />\nthe disastrous result. Weinecke<br />\nproved to be the only bright Hopkins<br />\nstar by garnering three hits, one a<br />\ndouble, in five times at bat. Hartke,<br />\nMorgenroth, and Clisham acquired<br />\nthe remainder of the Jays' hits.<br />\nSwarthmore Game<br />\nThe Swarthmore contest proved to<br />\nbe an exact replica of the previously<br />\nplayed encounter. The stage was a<br />\ndifferent field but the Hopkins characters remained the same with the<br />\nexception of Leonard Rubinger on the<br />\nmound.<br />\nThe game progressed evenly, both<br />\nteams scoring a pair of counters in<br />\nthe early frames. But with the entrance of a new Swarthmore pitcher,<br />\nthe Hopkins attack was throttled.<br />\nThe relief twirler, who last week<br />\npitched his team to a victory over<br />\nPennsylvania, held Hopkins completely in check, while his teammates<br />\npushed across a few tallies.

It was the spectacular offensive playing of Fred<br />\nStieber, who managed to score four<br />\ngoals,- one of them while lying flat<br />\non the ground, that provided the margin of victory.<br />\nThere was no score until almost<br />\nthe end of the first quarter when<br />\nStieber, wide open in the circle, received a pass from Sothoron and tallied immediately.

With only a few minutes left<br />\nbefore the half, Stieber eluded Swindell who had slipped, and ran in to<br />\ndent the cords, making the score 4<br />\nto 1. The half'ended with this shot.<br />\nJays Threaten<br />\nImmediately at the outset of the<br />\nthird canto, the Jay stickmen began<br />\nto force their opponents all the way<br />\nand continued to do so during the remainder of the contest. Sutton accounted for the first goal of the second half when he came from behind<br />\nthe goal and shot. The Blue Jays protested that he had scored from the<br />\ninside of the crease but the officials<br />\ndenied it. Thereupon the losers secured two more points in quick order,<br />\none by Kaufman on a pass from Melvin, and one by Himes, also fed by<br />\nMelvin, while a Mt. Washington defense man roosted in the penalty box.<br />\nAt this point it looked as though the<br />\nJays might rally and tie the score,<br />\nbut once again Stieber managed to<br />\nscore after luring Kahl from the goal<br />\nin a feint.

It was<br />\nin the third inning that the Hopkins<br />\nboys came to life and pushed across<br />\nthree runs to tie up the count. In the<br />\nfourth inning the Jays took the lead<br />\nby scoring one run and then adding<br />\nto their lead with another tally in<br />\nthe fifth stanza.<br />\nBy scoring a run in the fifth inning,<br />\nthe Drexel nine started what proved<br />\nto be the downfall of the Hopkins lead<br />\nand victory. In the following frame<br />\nthey scored no less than seven runs<br />\nwhich was brought about mainly by<br />\nthe errors of the Blue Jay infield and<br />\nthe temporary let-up of Pitcher Mur-<br /><br />\nray Scheff. Again in the eight inning the Jays displayed the same<br />\nragged playing that brought about<br />\nthe disastrous result. Weinecke<br />\nproved to be the only bright Hopkins<br />\nstar by garnering three hits, one a<br />\ndouble, in five times at bat. Hartke,<br />\nMorgenroth, and Clisham acquired<br />\nthe remainder of the Jays' hits.<br />\nSwarthmore Game<br />\nThe Swarthmore contest proved to<br />\nbe an exact replica of the previously<br />\nplayed encounter.
