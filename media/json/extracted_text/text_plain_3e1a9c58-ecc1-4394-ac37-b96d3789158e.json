The volkslied comes from the<br />\npeople and lives in them. At first<br />\nit was sung to all classes. There is<br />\nalways a melody to the songs, and<br />\nsometimes when the songs themselves have disappeared the melodies still exist. The melody to the<br />\nEnglish song, \"There is a Tavern in<br />\nevery Town,\" comes from a yolkslied; and so also does that to PrinceDr.<br />\nton's song, \"Old Nassau.\"<br />\nthese<br />\nFriedlaender showed how<br />\nmelodies were derived from the<br />\nGerman. The second lecture was on<br />\nThis great German<br />\n\"Schubert.\"<br />\nwas the first to recognize the possibilities of German song. One of the<br />\nstriking features of his life was<br />\nthat he lived, from birth until<br />\ndeath, in the direst poverty, going<br />\nabout hungry and ragged most of<br />\nthe time. He was a born musical<br />\ngenius, having shown his talent for<br />\nwriting plays and songs when only<br />\nfour years old. The last lecture was<br />\non \"Goethe.\" More of Goethe's<br />\nsongs have been put to xnusic than<br />\nthose of any one else.
