It lacked half<br />\nan hour before lecture time, and neither the head of the department<br />\nnor his stenographer had arrived, (which facts accounted for the<br />\n4.%<br />\n*\u2022<br />\nhalf chewed cigar in Henkel's mouth.)<br />\n\"Shade of Ricardo,\" muttered Spalmer, taking his feet from<br />\nthe table, and glancing again at the article they had been discussing,<br />\n\"Women in this department, Gadzooks!<br />\nNoiV4 . .<br />\nV<br />\n4.0<br />\n\"You will make a pretty picture, Henk, \"he added, replacing<br />\nhis feet, 'rubbing elbows and discussing Malthus with a co-ed.\"<br />\n\"Or reading a paper on the division of occupation in the corset industry before a bunch<br />\nof psyche knots,\" added Moore.<br />\n\"Go to the devil!\" growled Henkel. \"It's bad enough to have one's breakfast spoiled<br />\nabout this new co-educational rot, without being inflicted with your elaborations<br />\nreading<br />\nby<br />\nupon it.\"<br />\n\"It might not be so bad, after all,\" sighed Moore. \"This woman who starts in today<br />\ncomes from Smith College, the paper says, and according to Dr. Hardwood there are some<br />\ngood lookers up there.\"<br />\n\"Like ice!\" snapped Henkel. \"If he ever saw any good looking college women, he<br />\ntook good pains to marry one out of college. I am willing to wager my degree, that this one<br />\nwho comes today is as tall and as shapely as a tree-box; wears No. 9 shoes; and looks like<br />\nMoore. I never saw a college woman in my life, who didn't wear glasses the size of biscuits,<br />\nand walk like a policeman. She will probably talk to us about Kuno Fisher and woman's<br />\nrights on the plains of Elah.\"<br />\n\"She is not likely to worry you with her conversation,\" mildly suggested Moore.<br />\n\"I shall not give her a chance,\" replied Henkel with a sniff of superiority, \"She will<br />\nfind me dignified but exclusive; which being the case, and since all women must talk, she may<br />\ngive a portion of time to even such an ossified type of imbecility as yourself\u2014Well I'll be\u2014!\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nIn the doorway stood a dainty vision of feminine loveliness, arrayed in a tight-fitting<br />\nwalking suit, an irrepressible gleam of laughter shining from her eyes as she surveyed the<br />\nopen-mouthered trio.<br />\n\"May I come in?\" she asked looking from one to the other of the men.<br />\n\"Henkel was the first of the three to recover. Thrusting the cigar into his pocket, he<br />\nstumbled to his feet. \"Certainly, delighted, have a chair,\" he blurted out,\u2014and then in a<br />\nhoarse whisper to the still dazed Spalmer: \"Take your feet off the table, you ass.\"<br />\n\"I came in to see Dr. Hardwood. Is be here?\"<br />\n\"He will be here shortly,\" Moore hastened to say, elbowing Henkel to the background,<br />\n\"Take off your things,\u2014that is\u2014make yourself at home. The other men will be in soon.<br />\nBetter sit down; take my chair; nice deep draw there to keep your notes in.\"<br />\nShe looked at him, puzzled.<br />\n\"The Old Man, that is Dr. Hardwood, lectures today,\" put in Spalmer, \"You started<br />\nin just at the right time. He's going to talk on the Theory of Crises as applied to the manufacture of bath towels\u2014\"<br />\n.\"Are they playing socker at Smith this year?\" interrupted Henkel, casting a side-long<br />\nglare at Spalmer.<br />\nShe could scarcely conceal her amusement, but answered gravely: \"I was not aware<br />\nthat they were playing that game up there.\"<br />\n\"Why\u2014er\u2014yes, of course they do not. How stupid of me. \u2014This is a great department here.

You have hardly had chance to arrange all those details yet,\" said Moore, \"I<br />\nsuppose you have used Marshall?\"<br />\nShe was clearly bewildered now. \"No\u2014you see\u2014I am not\u2014\"<br />\n\"Well for preliminary work there are other authorities almost as good\" said Spaliner,<br />\nseeking to come to her rescue, \"Some prefer, for example,\u2014\"<br />\n\"But\u2014\" began the woman,\u2014<br />\nJust then there was a noise at the door, and Dr. Hardwood entered the room.

And those who saw his<br />\ncheerful face and careless air, which no amount<br />\nof trouble displaced, were filled with envy.<br />\nA certain fatal cleverness was at his command<br />\nand coupled with it a large fund of general<br />\ninformation which usually got him through<br />\ntroublesome examinations. And yet a certain<br />\nsadness filled him this morning as he walked<br />\nto the club. Some one was playing Grieg's<br />\n\"Spring Song\" and it awakened memories of<br />\nthose days when filled with deep resolutions<br />\nhe had been sent to college. It may have<br />\nbeen remorse from one too many highballs\u2014<br />\nbut duBois was not given to feeling badly the<br />\nmorning after. The music sweetly insinuated<br />\nhim with yearning for home and a riddance<br />\nof a less complex life. He lit a cigarette.<br />\nCIGARETTE NUMBER ONE.<br />\n<br />\nA collie dog laid at his feet in a drawing<br />\nroom. The sunlight poured in through open<br />\nwindows.

He had fought three<br />\nduels and eloped with a charming lady, and<br />\nended up his career by a fall from a horse.<br />\nThe duelling pistols were above the fire place.<br />\nThere was another portrait, that of a fine<br />\nlady with a proud and haughty face, and yet<br />\na certain soft and kindly hospitality gleamed<br />\nfrom her cleverly painted eyes.

He<br />\nquickly dismounted, tied the horse and<br />\nstole into the garden full of old fashioned<br />\nflowers. Past the sundial.

It<br />\nwas Christmas night and the place was in full<br />\nswing. A woman smiled with insinuation.<br />\nShe had green eyes. He started over to her.<br />\nBut at this moment a fight started. The mirrors were smashed by flying bottles. The<br />\nplace was in a tumultous confusion. The<br />\nwoman beckoned. He went over. \"Save<br />\nme please,\" she said quietly. \"If I stay here<br />\na minute longer I shall be killed, they are<br />\nafter me.\" \"Follow me,\" she said. A man<br />\nbarred the door. He only stayed for an instant for duBois tackled him around the knees.<br />\nThey were out in the open. Calling a cab,<br />\nthey were soon far away. And now said he,<br />\n\"where.shall I set you down?\" \"Anywhere\"<br />\nshe said. \"Well good night,\" said he.<br />\nAt home in his lonely room he said, \"I<br />\nsuppose it was because she had green eyes.\"<br />\nCIGARETTE NUMBER POUR.<br />\n<br />\nHis exams were a week off. He studied.<br />\nHis eyes burned, the fever seemed to bake<br />\nhim. His room-mate came in and found him<br />\ndelirious. He was put to bed in what seemed<br />\na furnace. For many days and nights he lay<br />\nin pain. Weaker he got and weaker.<br />\n\"There she is\u2014there she is\u2014I knew<br />\nit?\" \"Well Dick I'm done for. She told<br />\nMe she would come. This is the third time.\"<br />\nAnd then men said he died.<br />\n\"Why .the devil,\" said duBois smiling,<br />\n\"do you play such stuff.\"<br />\n\"It is no good for this sort of day. Come<br />\non get your tennis clothes and go out to the<br />\nCountry Club and play tennis, and have tea,<br />\nand then by way of amusing ourselves we can<br />\ngo to the theatre.\"<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nAN EGOISTICAL PLAIGERISM.<br />\nThe Prince, Prince Florizel of Bohemia,<br />\nlooked over his captors\u2014they were twelve in<br />\nnumber, then in his Usual dignified and condescending manner he pulled out his cigarette<br />\ncase and offered it to the group.<br />\n\"Gentlemen, will you try a simple paper<br />\ncigarette\u2014I assure you that they are quite<br />\ninnocuous.\"<br />\nSeveral of the men awaited themselves of<br />\nthe opportunity\u2014for Prince Florizel as is well<br />\nknown is in cigarettes as in other things a<br />\nconnosieur.<br />\nPutting the cigarette between his lips he<br />\ngazed at them in quiet amusement and said,<br />\n\"Gentlemen, while I feel greatly the compliment which you bestow on me by my capture,<br />\nI can only assure you that you will spend a<br />\nsleepless night and I shall leave you in the<br />\nmorning. I myself awake at ten in the evening and remain awake until daylight. If you<br />\ncare to sleep tonight I assure you, you will<br />\nfind me here tomorrow at your service. Otherwise I have no further pleasure than playing<br />\na rubber or two of whist, if any of your number will give me that pleasure. But,\" said<br />\nhe, \"where is my friend Col. Geraldine.\"<br />\nThereupon a sullen ill-mannered red-headed<br />\nperson spoke up, saying, \"If we keep him<br />\nfrom the signing of the treaty tomorrow<br />\nnight we must hurry. The Prince has some<br />\ngame in delaying us. Come on.\"<br />\nThen gathering his great coat and his kit<br />\nbag together they ushered Prince Florizel to<br />\na four wheeler, three inside\u2014three on the box<br />\nand took him to the town house of the Russian<br />\ncharge d'affairs. They led him to a room where<br />\nin he beheld Col. Geraldine eutirely tied up.<br />\nThe dinner dishes were on the table. The<br />\nPrince however very cleverly palmed a dinner<br />\nknife as he lit a cigarette let it slip up his<br />\nsleeve. The Prince strolled over to Geraldine<br />\nand said \"I will call for you at noon tomorrow.\" (Here says my Arabian author, is<br />\nshown the charming ease and savoir faire of<br />\nthe Prince on all occasions.)<br />\nThe Prince was then tied and taken in the<br />\nfour wheeler to the town house of the Russian<br />\nAmbassador. The doors were locked, the<br />\nshutters barricaded and the Prince tied securely<br />\nin a chair, but so as to allow the use of his<br />\nhands in cards.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHere they played\u2014the Prince smoking innumerable cigarettes which he always offered<br />\nto each of his guardians in turn. The night<br />\nwore on; at four the Prince and his partner the<br />\nRussian Ambassador were much the winners.<br />\n\"And now\" said they,\"you must go to bed.\"<br />\nSo saying they tied the Prince head hands and<br />\nfeet to a couch and leaving one as a watch<br />\nthey took their station in a bed before the<br />\ndoor.<br />\nAfter being tied for some time in this uncomfortable way the Prince suggested that he<br />\nbe again tied upright, for as yet the Prince saw<br />\nno opportunity of escape. So tied in his chair<br />\nhe again made the goaler play cards with him<br />\nand they smoked more of the inexhaustible<br />\nsupply of cigarettes.<br />\nSo the night wore on, the Prince unannoyed and indefatigable but everlooking for<br />\na chance to escape. The Prince now decided<br />\nit was about time to go. But he was tied<br />\nwrists, arms, body, knees and feet to the<br />\nchair.<br />\n\"Will you have the goodness,\" said he \"to<br />\ncover me with a blanket; I am chilled from<br />\nmy cramped position.\" It was done.<br />\nAfter ten minutes pause.<br />\n\"Will you have the goodness,\" said he \"to<br />\ncover my knees with my great coat.\" It was<br />\ndone.<br />\nTime, ever undetainable, went on, breakfast<br />\ntime drew near. The Russian Ambassador<br />\nand the Charge 'd Affairs withdrew to partake<br />\nof breakfast.<br />\nAll the while the guardian played solitaire<br />\nby the Prince's side.<br />\n\"I wish that I were in my quarters at<br />\nhome\" said the Prince.<br />\n\"Why,\" said the man.<br />\n\"Because,\" said the Prince, \"I have some<br />\nchoice whisky there, and I am very cold.\"<br />\n\"As your highness is in no danger of seeing<br />\nhis quarters till after the treaty is signed, if<br />\nhe will allow me I will be glad to accomodate<br />\nyour highness.\" Thus speaking he walked<br />\nacross the room.<br />\n\"No thank you\" said the Prince, \"I seldom<br />\ndrink, but when I do I don't care for fusil<br />\noil. I think I will go and get my own.\"<br />\nThereupon the Prince arose, sprang for the<br />\n<br />\ndoor, unlocked it. The guardian was there<br />\nimmediately. They grappled, there was a<br />\nshort struggle.<br />\n\"And now\" said the Prince \"I think I will<br />\nsee after my own whisky.\"<br />\nSo saying he bade the attendant a courteous good-morning and walked to his quarters,<br />\ngathered his men and set out for Colonel<br />\nGeraldine.<br />\n\"For,\" said he \"it is only right that I<br />\nshould thank my host for the service of this<br />\nuseful table knife.\"<br />\nHere narrates my Arabian Author the<br />\nPrince put in his mouth one of his well-known<br />\nbrand of cigarettes.<br />\n<br />\nMAN AND SUPERWOMAN.<br />\nOn one of his rambles through the town<br />\nmy friend Jack Crawford came to a street that<br />\nhad an indefinable charm. Were the houses<br />\nmagnificent? They were not. They were<br />\ndingy structures leaning some into the street<br />\nand some sideways. Here and there was a<br />\nshutter creaking in its one good socket and<br />\ntarnished brass adorned the long unpainted<br />\ndoors in the form of knockers and doorknobs.<br />\nPeeps at decayed gardens and courtyards he<br />\nsometimes caught in which strange cats, none<br />\ntoo sleek, sunned or refurbished their habits.<br />\nJack wore flannels and looked well tubbed<br />\nand groomed, even to his straw hat with its<br />\nclub ribband flashing in the warm airs of the<br />\nmorning in latter sprit. So he was particularly annoyed when a breeze blew his hat<br />\nover a wall into one of the gardens. He entered the garden by means of a gate in the<br />\nwall, and was about to go out with his recovered headgear when he saw a sundial in<br />\nthe middle of the boxed garden plots.<br />\n\"Staye while ye can<br />\nTime stays for no man.\"<br />\nThus ran thelegend on the sundial.<br />\n\"Devilish good advice! This spring<br />\nweather has gotten into my walking apparatus.\" So saying he sat down on a stone<br />\nbench, for the house seemed deserted and he<br />\nhad little fear of being caught intruding.<br />\n\"I wish to heaven I had a mint julep\"<br />\nsaid he looking at the mint bed which was<br />\nplanted round the little fountain.\"<br />\n\"You may,\" said a woman's voice above<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhim on a balcony hidden in the vines.<br />\nIf Jack had not been used to surprises and<br />\nmint juleps he would have vanished, but his<br />\nlove of adventure held him.<br />\n\"Thank you very much,\" he said uncovered and bowing to his unseen hostess.<br />\n\"I'll be down in a minute.\"<br />\n\"Two minutes later a little negro boy in<br />\nwhite jacket came out with a small decanter,<br />\nice and all the other ingredients of that delightful drink, the mint julep.<br />\nThree minutes later a girl in white summer<br />\nthings strolled across the garden.<br />\n\"How do yo do,\" said she.<br />\n\"Very nicely, thank you.\"<br />\n\"Help me gather the mint,\" said the good<br />\nlooking girl.<br />\nThereupon Jack gathered the mint and said<br />\nto himself \"you are drunk,\" and then remembered the translation from Hafiz which<br />\nhe repeated to himself.<br />\n\"Ah! Hafiz, thou art drunk,<br />\nDrunk with the Infinite,drunk with the Divine,<br />\nDrunk with music\u2014drunk with love<br />\nAh! Hafiz thou art drunk with wine!\"<br />\n\"I like Hafiz\u2014but not as much as FitzGerald Omar,\" said the amazing young<br />\nlady.<br />\n\"How did you know what I was thinking<br />\nof?\"<br />\n\"Yon may think it strange,\" said she,<br />\n\"but I am endowed with what people call<br />\nthe second sight. Really there is no such<br />\nthing, I think. Telepathy, I suppose, it is<br />\nuseful in diplomacy.\"<br />\n\"If I could do it,\" said Jack, \"there would<br />\nbe no need for conversation.\"<br />\n\"0 yes there would, for the same reason<br />\nthat society finds pleasure in talking. After.<br />\none has been out two seasons one can tell<br />\nwhat people are going to say anyway. And<br />\nconversation becomes merely an exercise in<br />\npermitations and combinations\u2014or perhaps a<br />\ngame of checkers.\"<br />\n\"Yes there are a certain number of possible obvious moves, the point being to say<br />\nall yours first in an attempt to exhaust the<br />\nenemy's supply of ammunition and make him<br />\nfeel uncomfortable, or to get him up in a corner and<br />\n\"Make him propose,\" said she. \"You<br />\nare progressing.\"<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nHe\u2014\"Do you like playing with a full<br />\nhand.\"<br />\nShe\u2014''No, I prefer the long and lingering<br />\ngame in which there are but two men on one<br />\nside and<br />\nHe\u2014''A Queen in the<br />\nShe\u2014\"Corner?

It<br />\nis not often that we, at Hopkins, are favored<br />\nwith anything but \"shop\" work, and as one<br />\nof the students aptly remarked, it is certainly<br />\nmost delightful to hear really good music<br />\nagain. Yet besides the pleasure of an entertainment of this kind there is a real and permanent value in that it gives an opportunity<br />\nfor social development, and for the improvement and refinement of those qualities which,<br />\nthough not found on any curriculum are<br />\nalways expected in a college man. In behalf<br />\nof the student body the NEWS-LETTER takes<br />\nthis opportunity to thank President and Mrs.<br />\nRemsen, and would also say that it hopes the<br />\nPresident's reception will become a fixed custom at Hopkins. It is probable that another<br />\nwill be given soon.<br />\n<br />\n.0<br />\n<br />\nthey would be valuable for illustrating the<br />\ncourse which he intend to give next year, he<br />\nwrote asking for funds to make the purchase.<br />\nMr. Buckley and other generously responded,<br />\nsending some three thousand dollars. When<br />\nthe funds were at hand, however, the price<br />\nasked was so exorbitant that Dr. Wilson,<br />\nwith the consent of the donors of the money,<br />\nwisely decided to spend the money in purchases, as the opportunity presents itself.<br />\nIn conjunction with Dr. Wilson, Dr. Robinson will give two new courses next year<br />\nopen to undergraduates, one on Greek and<br />\nRoman antiquities, the other on Greek and<br />\nRoman private life. The first will be a three<br />\nhour course; the second has not yet been<br />\ndefinitely arranged. At any rate, they will<br />\noffer great help to the classical student in<br />\nhelping him to get into the spirit of the Greek<br />\nand Roman writers.<br />\n<br />\nLEVERING HALL.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS NIGHT.<br />\n<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE CONFERENCE.<br />\n<br />\nThe next Hopkins Night will be held on<br />\nTuesday, April 23, at the Academy of Music.<br />\nThe attraction is the musical comedy \"Noah's<br />\nArk.\" The show is entirely new, and will<br />\nhave its premiere the night before, with Harry<br />\nBulger, of \"Woodland\" fame, and Maida<br />\nSnyder, at the head of the caste. The comedy<br />\nis said to be one of the best of recent years,<br />\nand certainly ought to be attractive with<br />\nBulger at its head. This will be an excellent<br />\nopportunity for some of the former \"supes\"<br />\nto get a job, and doubtless they would be<br />\nwell repaid by their experiences behind the<br />\nscenes of such a show.<br />\nThe committee is waking every effort to<br />\nhave this night a record-breaker, and they<br />\nhope that that night will see present a goodly<br />\nnumber of Hopkins men as well as outsiders.<br />\nThe show is well worth the money, and there<br />\nis no reason why we won't have a good crowd,<br />\nprovided every man conies up at the proper<br />\ntime.<br />\n<br />\nThe conference, held on March 9, was attended by about sixty delegates from twelve<br />\ncolleges in Maryland and the District of<br />\nColumbia. The speakers were Messrs. Fennell P. Turner and J. A. Lovell Murray, Dr.<br />\nGriggs of Peking, China, now studying at the<br />\nHopkins Medical School, and Mrs. Hoskins<br />\nof Beirut, Syria. Out-of-town students were<br />\nentertained by Hopkins men. Supper was<br />\nserved in Levering Hall.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Wilson in his recent investigations at<br />\nRome came across a very interesting collection of Roman antiquities which had been<br />\nexcavated near the Via Salaria.

Of course, these lineups have<br />\njust been to teach them the elementary principles of the game, for only three of the<br />\nFreshmen have ever had a stick in their hand<br />\nbefore they came to Hopkins.<br />\nThe candidates are working hard and show<br />\ngood spirit, but as the team is mostly new in<br />\nevery respect, the men will not be assigned to<br />\ntheir positions for some time. The days for<br />\nthe class games have not yet been decided on.<br />\n0--.<br />\n<br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\n<br />\nThe baseball team was greatly crippled<br />\nduring the holidays by the fact that the first<br />\nand third base were not held by the men who<br />\n'VARSITY LACROSSE.<br />\nhad been practicing in those positions.

M. A. C. scored<br />\nfirst, making two runs in the first inning,<br />\nbut in the fourth Hopkins was two runs<br />\nahead. By the sixth the score was even, and<br />\nfrom that point until the eleventh neither side<br />\ncould score. In this inning the visitors made<br />\ntwo runs, and it looked as though they might<br />\nwill out after all. Our chances looked particularly bad when our first two men struck out,<br />\nbut the third got to first somehow, and then<br />\nturned. With a two-bagger from Maynard<br />\nwe tied the score, and a moment later on a<br />\nsingle from Watkins won tne game.<br />\nOur line up follows :<br />\nA. B. H. 0.<br />\nA.

As a baseball game the exhibition was<br />\nexceedingly poor, for it was merely a test of<br />\nwhich set of men could endure the most cold,<br />\n<br />\nTRACK.<br />\nThe out-door season is on hand for sports<br />\nand, already, the members of the Track team<br />\nhave enjoyed the rush of the wind in their<br />\nfaces, and have had the pleasure of taking<br />\nenjoyable trips on crowded trolley-cars,<br />\nthrough such pleasant quiet scenes as one<br />\nfind on Pratt street.<br />\nThe United Railway Company and the<br />\nweather man seem bound to keep the track<br />\nteam from training; the former by not furnishing a more convenient means of transportation<br />\nto Patterson Park, and the latter by furnishing a too-abundant supply of snow in the<br />\nsecond week in April.<br />\nIn spite of these difficulties, however, the<br />\nseason has fairly commenced, and either because it is the custom or because one naturally feels optimistic after the Easter examinations are over, we find it incumbent to predict<br />\na very successful season.<br />\nThe first event to come off is the Pennsylvania Relay Races, and needless to say every<br />\none is confident of success, even our opponents. The men are rounding into fine form<br />\n(all track men should have good forms, although, alas, many have not) and best of all,<br />\nthey are not new. Padgett, Stewart, Hunter<br />\nand Perce have all had experience on the<br />\nteam before, and Treading, Graves and the<br />\nother candidates for positions all know what<br />\nit is to have a track shoe on. The struggle<br />\nfor places on the team should be hard fought<br />\nthis year, and that always brings out the best<br />\nteam possible in the University.<br />\nThe squad now is quite large. Nearly<br />\nevery one, whoever pretended to run, is quite<br />\nenthusiastic at present, and you can see quite<br />\na few men daily running up and down the<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncage in the abbreviated track suit. The track<br />\npicture will be taken soon.<br />\nThe outlook for the Virginia dual meet<br />\nis not so favorable as it was last year. The<br />\nloss of Hill, Knight and several other good<br />\nmen, through graduation or otherwise, makes<br />\nit necessary to develop new men to take their<br />\nplaces and at present these new men are not<br />\nover-plentiful.<br />\nThe teams greatest weakness is in the field<br />\nevents. There is a lack of weight-men and<br />\njumpers, and it is the duty of every man who<br />\never did anything in these lines to come out<br />\nand help beat Virginia.<br />\nIf Hopkins is to beat Virginia and the<br />\nNaval Academy this year, it means hard<br />\nwork, not hard work by a few, but by a concentrated effort by the whole undergraduate<br />\nbody. As a united body, we may hope to accomplish much, so get together.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nCARL C.

MESNY<br />\nARTIST PHOTOGRAPHER<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nAs probably every one knows, the lacrosse<br />\nseason opened on Saturday, April sixth, with<br />\nthe game between the Alumni and the 'Varsity. The former team was composed of<br />\nformer players and scrubs from this year's<br />\nand, of course, had little or no team work.<br />\nNevertheless, they put up an excellent game<br />\nand were the first to score. That first goal<br />\nwas well earned by the Alumni, and the<br />\n'Varsity defense was certainly \"up in the air\"<br />\nwhen it was made. Coming as it did, after<br />\nabout three minutes of play, it caused some<br />\nof the Alumni to chortle in high glee, and<br />\nseveral of the wiseacres on the sidelines began<br />\nto shake their heads and make dire prophecies<br />\nas to what would be the outcome of the game,<br />\nand even the season. Their doubts and fears<br />\nwere quickly dispelled later, however, for<br />\nwhen the 'Varsity struck their pace, they did<br />\nnot let up until the last whistle blew, when<br />\nthere were 11 goals to the credit of the 1907<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe 'Varsity, in spite of their good showing, need not get puffed up. Nearly half of<br />\nthe opponents were scrubs, some of whom were<br />\nplaying for the first time in a regular game,<br />\nTherefore, because they shot 11 goals is no<br />\nsign that they will have an easy time with<br />\nMt.

The latter missed the services of<br />\nCaptain Tough, who thought it wiser to stay<br />\nout of the game, on account of a little soreness in his leg.

It lacked half<br />\nan hour before lecture time, and neither the head of the department<br />\nnor his stenographer had arrived, (which facts accounted for the<br />\n4.%<br />\n*\u2022<br />\nhalf chewed cigar in Henkel's mouth.)<br />\n\"Shade of Ricardo,\" muttered Spalmer, taking his feet from<br />\nthe table, and glancing again at the article they had been discussing,<br />\n\"Women in this department, Gadzooks!<br />\nNoiV4 . .<br />\nV<br />\n4.0<br />\n\"You will make a pretty picture, Henk, \"he added, replacing<br />\nhis feet, 'rubbing elbows and discussing Malthus with a co-ed.\"<br />\n\"Or reading a paper on the division of occupation in the corset industry before a bunch<br />\nof psyche knots,\" added Moore.<br />\n\"Go to the devil!\" growled Henkel. \"It's bad enough to have one's breakfast spoiled<br />\nabout this new co-educational rot, without being inflicted with your elaborations<br />\nreading<br />\nby<br />\nupon it.\"<br />\n\"It might not be so bad, after all,\" sighed Moore. \"This woman who starts in today<br />\ncomes from Smith College, the paper says, and according to Dr. Hardwood there are some<br />\ngood lookers up there.\"<br />\n\"Like ice!\" snapped Henkel. \"If he ever saw any good looking college women, he<br />\ntook good pains to marry one out of college. I am willing to wager my degree, that this one<br />\nwho comes today is as tall and as shapely as a tree-box; wears No. 9 shoes; and looks like<br />\nMoore. I never saw a college woman in my life, who didn't wear glasses the size of biscuits,<br />\nand walk like a policeman. She will probably talk to us about Kuno Fisher and woman's<br />\nrights on the plains of Elah.\"<br />\n\"She is not likely to worry you with her conversation,\" mildly suggested Moore.<br />\n\"I shall not give her a chance,\" replied Henkel with a sniff of superiority, \"She will<br />\nfind me dignified but exclusive; which being the case, and since all women must talk, she may<br />\ngive a portion of time to even such an ossified type of imbecility as yourself\u2014Well I'll be\u2014!\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nIn the doorway stood a dainty vision of feminine loveliness, arrayed in a tight-fitting<br />\nwalking suit, an irrepressible gleam of laughter shining from her eyes as she surveyed the<br />\nopen-mouthered trio.<br />\n\"May I come in?\" she asked looking from one to the other of the men.<br />\n\"Henkel was the first of the three to recover. Thrusting the cigar into his pocket, he<br />\nstumbled to his feet. \"Certainly, delighted, have a chair,\" he blurted out,\u2014and then in a<br />\nhoarse whisper to the still dazed Spalmer: \"Take your feet off the table, you ass.\"<br />\n\"I came in to see Dr. Hardwood. Is be here?\"<br />\n\"He will be here shortly,\" Moore hastened to say, elbowing Henkel to the background,<br />\n\"Take off your things,\u2014that is\u2014make yourself at home. The other men will be in soon.<br />\nBetter sit down; take my chair; nice deep draw there to keep your notes in.\"<br />\nShe looked at him, puzzled.<br />\n\"The Old Man, that is Dr. Hardwood, lectures today,\" put in Spalmer, \"You started<br />\nin just at the right time. He's going to talk on the Theory of Crises as applied to the manufacture of bath towels\u2014\"<br />\n.\"Are they playing socker at Smith this year?\" interrupted Henkel, casting a side-long<br />\nglare at Spalmer.<br />\nShe could scarcely conceal her amusement, but answered gravely: \"I was not aware<br />\nthat they were playing that game up there.\"<br />\n\"Why\u2014er\u2014yes, of course they do not. How stupid of me. \u2014This is a great department here. You won't find it so hard at first.\u2014 What is your minor course going to be?\"<br />\n\"Why, I don't understand,\" she said, \"You see, I just stopped in a moment to ask<br />\nDr. Hardwood\u2014\"<br />\n\"I see. You have hardly had chance to arrange all those details yet,\" said Moore, \"I<br />\nsuppose you have used Marshall?\"<br />\nShe was clearly bewildered now. \"No\u2014you see\u2014I am not\u2014\"<br />\n\"Well for preliminary work there are other authorities almost as good\" said Spaliner,<br />\nseeking to come to her rescue, \"Some prefer, for example,\u2014\"<br />\n\"But\u2014\" began the woman,\u2014<br />\nJust then there was a noise at the door, and Dr. Hardwood entered the room. His face<br />\nlighted up at seeing the woman, \"Well, well,\" he exclaimed, \"You here! Allow me, gentlemen, my wife!\"<br />\nTHE CO-ED.<br />\n\"The Co-ed she leads a jolly life, jolly life!\"\u2014Old Song.<br /><br />\nRejoice! rejoice! ye graduates all,<br />\nFor the ladies will soon be here;<br />\nSome thin and some fat; some short and some tall;<br />\nSome pretty (?) some homely,(we fear.)<br />\nRejoice! rejoice? ye undergrads, do!<br />\nNo co-ed at all need we fear\u2014<br />\nMe for the girl with eyes of blue<br />\n(And I bet there won't be any here!)<br />\nMe for the maid who hardly can tell<br />\nLatin from Sanskit or Greek,<br />\nBut whose language is one that we know full well,<br />\nThe one we all know how to speak.<br />\nMe for the girl whose knowledge of math.<br />\nConsists in keeping a score<br />\nOf the lovers she's going to have, or she hath,<br />\nHere's to HER!

And those who saw his<br />\ncheerful face and careless air, which no amount<br />\nof trouble displaced, were filled with envy.<br />\nA certain fatal cleverness was at his command<br />\nand coupled with it a large fund of general<br />\ninformation which usually got him through<br />\ntroublesome examinations. And yet a certain<br />\nsadness filled him this morning as he walked<br />\nto the club. Some one was playing Grieg's<br />\n\"Spring Song\" and it awakened memories of<br />\nthose days when filled with deep resolutions<br />\nhe had been sent to college. It may have<br />\nbeen remorse from one too many highballs\u2014<br />\nbut duBois was not given to feeling badly the<br />\nmorning after. The music sweetly insinuated<br />\nhim with yearning for home and a riddance<br />\nof a less complex life. He lit a cigarette.<br />\nCIGARETTE NUMBER ONE.<br /><br />\nA collie dog laid at his feet in a drawing<br />\nroom. The sunlight poured in through open<br />\nwindows. Family portraits in all stages of<br />\nage and size covered the walls. The man<br />\nwith the smiling face and well-groomed air<br />\nwas a grandfather. He had fought three<br />\nduels and eloped with a charming lady, and<br />\nended up his career by a fall from a horse.<br />\nThe duelling pistols were above the fire place.<br />\nThere was another portrait, that of a fine<br />\nlady with a proud and haughty face, and yet<br />\na certain soft and kindly hospitality gleamed<br />\nfrom her cleverly painted eyes.

Large<br />\nold houses spread themselves along the ridges.<br />\nThe horse under him galloped easily. They<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ndrew up besides a garden wall. He gazed<br />\ninto it where sat a girl looking down into the<br />\nbasin of a fountain filled with gold fish. He<br />\nquickly dismounted, tied the horse and<br />\nstole into the garden full of old fashioned<br />\nflowers. Past the sundial. On the sundial<br />\nhe knew the inscription, \"Time flies, but love<br />\nis long.\" And he stole over and kissed the<br />\ngirl\u2014the girl had green eyes.<br />\nCIGARETTE NUMBER THREE.<br /><br />\nIt was the Cafe Papillon, There were curtained booths and in the open floor many<br />\nlittle mahogany tables.

It<br />\nwas Christmas night and the place was in full<br />\nswing. A woman smiled with insinuation.<br />\nShe had green eyes. He started over to her.<br />\nBut at this moment a fight started. The mirrors were smashed by flying bottles. The<br />\nplace was in a tumultous confusion. The<br />\nwoman beckoned. He went over. \"Save<br />\nme please,\" she said quietly. \"If I stay here<br />\na minute longer I shall be killed, they are<br />\nafter me.\" \"Follow me,\" she said. A man<br />\nbarred the door. He only stayed for an instant for duBois tackled him around the knees.<br />\nThey were out in the open. Calling a cab,<br />\nthey were soon far away. And now said he,<br />\n\"where.shall I set you down?\" \"Anywhere\"<br />\nshe said. \"Well good night,\" said he.<br />\nAt home in his lonely room he said, \"I<br />\nsuppose it was because she had green eyes.\"<br />\nCIGARETTE NUMBER POUR.<br /><br />\nHis exams were a week off. He studied.<br />\nHis eyes burned, the fever seemed to bake<br />\nhim. His room-mate came in and found him<br />\ndelirious. He was put to bed in what seemed<br />\na furnace. For many days and nights he lay<br />\nin pain. Weaker he got and weaker.<br />\n\"There she is\u2014there she is\u2014I knew<br />\nit?\" \"Well Dick I'm done for. She told<br />\nMe she would come. This is the third time.\"<br />\nAnd then men said he died.<br />\n\"Why .the devil,\" said duBois smiling,<br />\n\"do you play such stuff.\"<br />\n\"It is no good for this sort of day. Come<br />\non get your tennis clothes and go out to the<br />\nCountry Club and play tennis, and have tea,<br />\nand then by way of amusing ourselves we can<br />\ngo to the theatre.\"<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nAN EGOISTICAL PLAIGERISM.<br />\nThe Prince, Prince Florizel of Bohemia,<br />\nlooked over his captors\u2014they were twelve in<br />\nnumber, then in his Usual dignified and condescending manner he pulled out his cigarette<br />\ncase and offered it to the group.<br />\n\"Gentlemen, will you try a simple paper<br />\ncigarette\u2014I assure you that they are quite<br />\ninnocuous.\"<br />\nSeveral of the men awaited themselves of<br />\nthe opportunity\u2014for Prince Florizel as is well<br />\nknown is in cigarettes as in other things a<br />\nconnosieur.<br />\nPutting the cigarette between his lips he<br />\ngazed at them in quiet amusement and said,<br />\n\"Gentlemen, while I feel greatly the compliment which you bestow on me by my capture,<br />\nI can only assure you that you will spend a<br />\nsleepless night and I shall leave you in the<br />\nmorning. I myself awake at ten in the evening and remain awake until daylight. If you<br />\ncare to sleep tonight I assure you, you will<br />\nfind me here tomorrow at your service. Otherwise I have no further pleasure than playing<br />\na rubber or two of whist, if any of your number will give me that pleasure. But,\" said<br />\nhe, \"where is my friend Col. Geraldine.\"<br />\nThereupon a sullen ill-mannered red-headed<br />\nperson spoke up, saying, \"If we keep him<br />\nfrom the signing of the treaty tomorrow<br />\nnight we must hurry. The Prince has some<br />\ngame in delaying us. Come on.\"<br />\nThen gathering his great coat and his kit<br />\nbag together they ushered Prince Florizel to<br />\na four wheeler, three inside\u2014three on the box<br />\nand took him to the town house of the Russian<br />\ncharge d'affairs. They led him to a room where<br />\nin he beheld Col. Geraldine eutirely tied up.<br />\nThe dinner dishes were on the table. The<br />\nPrince however very cleverly palmed a dinner<br />\nknife as he lit a cigarette let it slip up his<br />\nsleeve. The Prince strolled over to Geraldine<br />\nand said \"I will call for you at noon tomorrow.\" (Here says my Arabian author, is<br />\nshown the charming ease and savoir faire of<br />\nthe Prince on all occasions.)<br />\nThe Prince was then tied and taken in the<br />\nfour wheeler to the town house of the Russian<br />\nAmbassador. The doors were locked, the<br />\nshutters barricaded and the Prince tied securely<br />\nin a chair, but so as to allow the use of his<br />\nhands in cards.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nHere they played\u2014the Prince smoking innumerable cigarettes which he always offered<br />\nto each of his guardians in turn. The night<br />\nwore on; at four the Prince and his partner the<br />\nRussian Ambassador were much the winners.<br />\n\"And now\" said they,\"you must go to bed.\"<br />\nSo saying they tied the Prince head hands and<br />\nfeet to a couch and leaving one as a watch<br />\nthey took their station in a bed before the<br />\ndoor.<br />\nAfter being tied for some time in this uncomfortable way the Prince suggested that he<br />\nbe again tied upright, for as yet the Prince saw<br />\nno opportunity of escape. So tied in his chair<br />\nhe again made the goaler play cards with him<br />\nand they smoked more of the inexhaustible<br />\nsupply of cigarettes.<br />\nSo the night wore on, the Prince unannoyed and indefatigable but everlooking for<br />\na chance to escape. The Prince now decided<br />\nit was about time to go. But he was tied<br />\nwrists, arms, body, knees and feet to the<br />\nchair.<br />\n\"Will you have the goodness,\" said he \"to<br />\ncover me with a blanket; I am chilled from<br />\nmy cramped position.\" It was done.<br />\nAfter ten minutes pause.<br />\n\"Will you have the goodness,\" said he \"to<br />\ncover my knees with my great coat.\" It was<br />\ndone.<br />\nTime, ever undetainable, went on, breakfast<br />\ntime drew near. The Russian Ambassador<br />\nand the Charge 'd Affairs withdrew to partake<br />\nof breakfast.<br />\nAll the while the guardian played solitaire<br />\nby the Prince's side.<br />\n\"I wish that I were in my quarters at<br />\nhome\" said the Prince.<br />\n\"Why,\" said the man.<br />\n\"Because,\" said the Prince, \"I have some<br />\nchoice whisky there, and I am very cold.\"<br />\n\"As your highness is in no danger of seeing<br />\nhis quarters till after the treaty is signed, if<br />\nhe will allow me I will be glad to accomodate<br />\nyour highness.\" Thus speaking he walked<br />\nacross the room.<br />\n\"No thank you\" said the Prince, \"I seldom<br />\ndrink, but when I do I don't care for fusil<br />\noil. I think I will go and get my own.\"<br />\nThereupon the Prince arose, sprang for the<br /><br />\ndoor, unlocked it. The guardian was there<br />\nimmediately. They grappled, there was a<br />\nshort struggle.<br />\n\"And now\" said the Prince \"I think I will<br />\nsee after my own whisky.\"<br />\nSo saying he bade the attendant a courteous good-morning and walked to his quarters,<br />\ngathered his men and set out for Colonel<br />\nGeraldine.<br />\n\"For,\" said he \"it is only right that I<br />\nshould thank my host for the service of this<br />\nuseful table knife.\"<br />\nHere narrates my Arabian Author the<br />\nPrince put in his mouth one of his well-known<br />\nbrand of cigarettes.<br /><br />\nMAN AND SUPERWOMAN.<br />\nOn one of his rambles through the town<br />\nmy friend Jack Crawford came to a street that<br />\nhad an indefinable charm. Were the houses<br />\nmagnificent? They were not. They were<br />\ndingy structures leaning some into the street<br />\nand some sideways. Here and there was a<br />\nshutter creaking in its one good socket and<br />\ntarnished brass adorned the long unpainted<br />\ndoors in the form of knockers and doorknobs.<br />\nPeeps at decayed gardens and courtyards he<br />\nsometimes caught in which strange cats, none<br />\ntoo sleek, sunned or refurbished their habits.<br />\nJack wore flannels and looked well tubbed<br />\nand groomed, even to his straw hat with its<br />\nclub ribband flashing in the warm airs of the<br />\nmorning in latter sprit. So he was particularly annoyed when a breeze blew his hat<br />\nover a wall into one of the gardens. He entered the garden by means of a gate in the<br />\nwall, and was about to go out with his recovered headgear when he saw a sundial in<br />\nthe middle of the boxed garden plots.<br />\n\"Staye while ye can<br />\nTime stays for no man.\"<br />\nThus ran thelegend on the sundial.<br />\n\"Devilish good advice! This spring<br />\nweather has gotten into my walking apparatus.\" So saying he sat down on a stone<br />\nbench, for the house seemed deserted and he<br />\nhad little fear of being caught intruding.<br />\n\"I wish to heaven I had a mint julep\"<br />\nsaid he looking at the mint bed which was<br />\nplanted round the little fountain.\"<br />\n\"You may,\" said a woman's voice above<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nhim on a balcony hidden in the vines.<br />\nIf Jack had not been used to surprises and<br />\nmint juleps he would have vanished, but his<br />\nlove of adventure held him.<br />\n\"Thank you very much,\" he said uncovered and bowing to his unseen hostess.<br />\n\"I'll be down in a minute.\"<br />\n\"Two minutes later a little negro boy in<br />\nwhite jacket came out with a small decanter,<br />\nice and all the other ingredients of that delightful drink, the mint julep.<br />\nThree minutes later a girl in white summer<br />\nthings strolled across the garden.<br />\n\"How do yo do,\" said she.<br />\n\"Very nicely, thank you.\"<br />\n\"Help me gather the mint,\" said the good<br />\nlooking girl.<br />\nThereupon Jack gathered the mint and said<br />\nto himself \"you are drunk,\" and then remembered the translation from Hafiz which<br />\nhe repeated to himself.<br />\n\"Ah! Hafiz, thou art drunk,<br />\nDrunk with the Infinite,drunk with the Divine,<br />\nDrunk with music\u2014drunk with love<br />\nAh! Hafiz thou art drunk with wine!\"<br />\n\"I like Hafiz\u2014but not as much as FitzGerald Omar,\" said the amazing young<br />\nlady.<br />\n\"How did you know what I was thinking<br />\nof?\"<br />\n\"Yon may think it strange,\" said she,<br />\n\"but I am endowed with what people call<br />\nthe second sight. Really there is no such<br />\nthing, I think. Telepathy, I suppose, it is<br />\nuseful in diplomacy.\"<br />\n\"If I could do it,\" said Jack, \"there would<br />\nbe no need for conversation.\"<br />\n\"0 yes there would, for the same reason<br />\nthat society finds pleasure in talking. After.<br />\none has been out two seasons one can tell<br />\nwhat people are going to say anyway. And<br />\nconversation becomes merely an exercise in<br />\npermitations and combinations\u2014or perhaps a<br />\ngame of checkers.\"<br />\n\"Yes there are a certain number of possible obvious moves, the point being to say<br />\nall yours first in an attempt to exhaust the<br />\nenemy's supply of ammunition and make him<br />\nfeel uncomfortable, or to get him up in a corner and<br />\n\"Make him propose,\" said she. \"You<br />\nare progressing.\"<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nHe\u2014\"Do you like playing with a full<br />\nhand.\"<br />\nShe\u2014''No, I prefer the long and lingering<br />\ngame in which there are but two men on one<br />\nside and<br />\nHe\u2014''A Queen in the<br />\nShe\u2014\"Corner? No, because the Queen is<br />\nnever in the corner, nor does she enjoy a<br />\ngame unless there is a choice, besides she has<br />\nthe advantage.\"<br />\nHe\u2014\"Three alternatives as it were, to capture one, to capture both, or to be captured<br />\nby either.\"<br />\nShe\u2014\"Four! She can move back and forth<br />\nin the corner.\"<br />\nHe\u2014\"And in the case that there was only<br />\none man on the board.\"<br />\nShe\u2014\"She would tantalize him and pay no<br />\nattention to him in the next game.\"<br />\nHe\u2014''And what do you think of flirtation.\"<br />\nShe\u2014\"Precisely what you do\u2014I exercise<br />\nmy second sight.\"<br />\nHe\u2014''And what do I think.\"<br />\n\"You in you present state of mind will<br />\nthink anything I choose to make you think.\"<br />\n\"And that is that flirtation is a delightful<br />\ngame only to be likened to fox hunting and<br />\nmint juleps.\"<br />\n\"Oh, we forgot them!\"<br />\nAs they drank them she said, \"I will<br />\nanswer your question\u2014that you are going to<br />\nask yourself in ten minutes\u2014I came down<br />\nbecause I saw your hatband\u2014My father wears<br />\none. \"Good-bye,\" said she, stretching out<br />\nher hand, \"I will see you at luncheon next<br />\nMonday. We will continue our game of\u2014<br />\n\"Checkers.\"<br />\nShe was undoubtedly gone.<br />\nAnd Jack Crawford wandered home. He<br />\nfound a note from his great aunt.<br />\nDUAR JACK:<br />\n\"Come and lunch with me at three next<br />\nMonday.

Well, I will<br />\ngo and find out!\"<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE PRESIDENT'S RECEPTION.<br />\nOn Friday, March fifteenth a very pleasant<br />\nmusical was given to the student body by the<br />\nPresident and Mrs. Remsen in Coy Hall. It<br />\nis not often that we, at Hopkins, are favored<br />\nwith anything but \"shop\" work, and as one<br />\nof the students aptly remarked, it is certainly<br />\nmost delightful to hear really good music<br />\nagain. Yet besides the pleasure of an entertainment of this kind there is a real and permanent value in that it gives an opportunity<br />\nfor social development, and for the improvement and refinement of those qualities which,<br />\nthough not found on any curriculum are<br />\nalways expected in a college man. In behalf<br />\nof the student body the NEWS-LETTER takes<br />\nthis opportunity to thank President and Mrs.<br />\nRemsen, and would also say that it hopes the<br />\nPresident's reception will become a fixed custom at Hopkins. It is probable that another<br />\nwill be given soon.<br /><br />\n.0<br /><br />\nthey would be valuable for illustrating the<br />\ncourse which he intend to give next year, he<br />\nwrote asking for funds to make the purchase.<br />\nMr. Buckley and other generously responded,<br />\nsending some three thousand dollars. When<br />\nthe funds were at hand, however, the price<br />\nasked was so exorbitant that Dr. Wilson,<br />\nwith the consent of the donors of the money,<br />\nwisely decided to spend the money in purchases, as the opportunity presents itself.<br />\nIn conjunction with Dr. Wilson, Dr. Robinson will give two new courses next year<br />\nopen to undergraduates, one on Greek and<br />\nRoman antiquities, the other on Greek and<br />\nRoman private life. The first will be a three<br />\nhour course; the second has not yet been<br />\ndefinitely arranged. At any rate, they will<br />\noffer great help to the classical student in<br />\nhelping him to get into the spirit of the Greek<br />\nand Roman writers.<br /><br />\nLEVERING HALL.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS NIGHT.<br /><br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE CONFERENCE.<br /><br />\nThe next Hopkins Night will be held on<br />\nTuesday, April 23, at the Academy of Music.<br />\nThe attraction is the musical comedy \"Noah's<br />\nArk.\" The show is entirely new, and will<br />\nhave its premiere the night before, with Harry<br />\nBulger, of \"Woodland\" fame, and Maida<br />\nSnyder, at the head of the caste. The comedy<br />\nis said to be one of the best of recent years,<br />\nand certainly ought to be attractive with<br />\nBulger at its head. This will be an excellent<br />\nopportunity for some of the former \"supes\"<br />\nto get a job, and doubtless they would be<br />\nwell repaid by their experiences behind the<br />\nscenes of such a show.<br />\nThe committee is waking every effort to<br />\nhave this night a record-breaker, and they<br />\nhope that that night will see present a goodly<br />\nnumber of Hopkins men as well as outsiders.<br />\nThe show is well worth the money, and there<br />\nis no reason why we won't have a good crowd,<br />\nprovided every man conies up at the proper<br />\ntime.<br /><br />\nThe conference, held on March 9, was attended by about sixty delegates from twelve<br />\ncolleges in Maryland and the District of<br />\nColumbia. The speakers were Messrs. Fennell P. Turner and J. A. Lovell Murray, Dr.<br />\nGriggs of Peking, China, now studying at the<br />\nHopkins Medical School, and Mrs. Hoskins<br />\nof Beirut, Syria. Out-of-town students were<br />\nentertained by Hopkins men. Supper was<br />\nserved in Levering Hall.<br /><br />\nDr. Wilson in his recent investigations at<br />\nRome came across a very interesting collection of Roman antiquities which had been<br />\nexcavated near the Via Salaria. Seeing that<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nHOPKINS AT JAMESTOWN.<br />\nA space twenty-six by fifteen feet in a<br />\ndesirable part of the Educational Building has<br />\nbeen set aside for our exhibit at Jamestown.<br />\nOur display is limited practically to four lines<br />\nrepresenting mainly the scientific activities of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nFirst.

Of course, these lineups have<br />\njust been to teach them the elementary principles of the game, for only three of the<br />\nFreshmen have ever had a stick in their hand<br />\nbefore they came to Hopkins.<br />\nThe candidates are working hard and show<br />\ngood spirit, but as the team is mostly new in<br />\nevery respect, the men will not be assigned to<br />\ntheir positions for some time.

M. A. C. scored<br />\nfirst, making two runs in the first inning,<br />\nbut in the fourth Hopkins was two runs<br />\nahead. By the sixth the score was even, and<br />\nfrom that point until the eleventh neither side<br />\ncould score. In this inning the visitors made<br />\ntwo runs, and it looked as though they might<br />\nwill out after all. Our chances looked particularly bad when our first two men struck out,<br />\nbut the third got to first somehow, and then<br />\nturned. With a two-bagger from Maynard<br />\nwe tied the score, and a moment later on a<br />\nsingle from Watkins won tne game.<br />\nOur line up follows :<br />\nA. B. H. 0.<br />\nA.

As a baseball game the exhibition was<br />\nexceedingly poor, for it was merely a test of<br />\nwhich set of men could endure the most cold,<br /><br />\nTRACK.<br />\nThe out-door season is on hand for sports<br />\nand, already, the members of the Track team<br />\nhave enjoyed the rush of the wind in their<br />\nfaces, and have had the pleasure of taking<br />\nenjoyable trips on crowded trolley-cars,<br />\nthrough such pleasant quiet scenes as one<br />\nfind on Pratt street.<br />\nThe United Railway Company and the<br />\nweather man seem bound to keep the track<br />\nteam from training; the former by not furnishing a more convenient means of transportation<br />\nto Patterson Park, and the latter by furnishing a too-abundant supply of snow in the<br />\nsecond week in April.<br />\nIn spite of these difficulties, however, the<br />\nseason has fairly commenced, and either because it is the custom or because one naturally feels optimistic after the Easter examinations are over, we find it incumbent to predict<br />\na very successful season.<br />\nThe first event to come off is the Pennsylvania Relay Races, and needless to say every<br />\none is confident of success, even our opponents. The men are rounding into fine form<br />\n(all track men should have good forms, although, alas, many have not) and best of all,<br />\nthey are not new. Padgett, Stewart, Hunter<br />\nand Perce have all had experience on the<br />\nteam before, and Treading, Graves and the<br />\nother candidates for positions all know what<br />\nit is to have a track shoe on. The struggle<br />\nfor places on the team should be hard fought<br />\nthis year, and that always brings out the best<br />\nteam possible in the University.<br />\nThe squad now is quite large. Nearly<br />\nevery one, whoever pretended to run, is quite<br />\nenthusiastic at present, and you can see quite<br />\na few men daily running up and down the<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncage in the abbreviated track suit. The track<br />\npicture will be taken soon.<br />\nThe outlook for the Virginia dual meet<br />\nis not so favorable as it was last year. The<br />\nloss of Hill, Knight and several other good<br />\nmen, through graduation or otherwise, makes<br />\nit necessary to develop new men to take their<br />\nplaces and at present these new men are not<br />\nover-plentiful.<br />\nThe teams greatest weakness is in the field<br />\nevents. There is a lack of weight-men and<br />\njumpers, and it is the duty of every man who<br />\never did anything in these lines to come out<br />\nand help beat Virginia.<br />\nIf Hopkins is to beat Virginia and the<br />\nNaval Academy this year, it means hard<br />\nwork, not hard work by a few, but by a concentrated effort by the whole undergraduate<br />\nbody. As a united body, we may hope to accomplish much, so get together.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nCARL C.

MESNY<br />\nARTIST PHOTOGRAPHER<br /><br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nAs probably every one knows, the lacrosse<br />\nseason opened on Saturday, April sixth, with<br />\nthe game between the Alumni and the 'Varsity. The former team was composed of<br />\nformer players and scrubs from this year's<br />\nand, of course, had little or no team work.<br />\nNevertheless, they put up an excellent game<br />\nand were the first to score. That first goal<br />\nwas well earned by the Alumni, and the<br />\n'Varsity defense was certainly \"up in the air\"<br />\nwhen it was made. Coming as it did, after<br />\nabout three minutes of play, it caused some<br />\nof the Alumni to chortle in high glee, and<br />\nseveral of the wiseacres on the sidelines began<br />\nto shake their heads and make dire prophecies<br />\nas to what would be the outcome of the game,<br />\nand even the season. Their doubts and fears<br />\nwere quickly dispelled later, however, for<br />\nwhen the 'Varsity struck their pace, they did<br />\nnot let up until the last whistle blew, when<br />\nthere were 11 goals to the credit of the 1907<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe 'Varsity, in spite of their good showing, need not get puffed up. Nearly half of<br />\nthe opponents were scrubs, some of whom were<br />\nplaying for the first time in a regular game,<br />\nTherefore, because they shot 11 goals is no<br />\nsign that they will have an easy time with<br />\nMt. Washington or Swarthmore, later on.<br /><br />\n226 N. Charles Street<br /><br />\nBaltimore<br /><br />\nR. Q.

The latter missed the services of<br />\nCaptain Tough, who thought it wiser to stay<br />\nout of the game, on account of a little soreness in his leg. As a result the defense did<br />\nnot strike the proper gait until the second<br />\nhalf, when the goal was scarcely threatened.<br />\nIt was pleasing to see Dr. Abercrombie and<br />\nsome of the other \"old men\" come out and<br />\nshow flashes of their old-time form.
