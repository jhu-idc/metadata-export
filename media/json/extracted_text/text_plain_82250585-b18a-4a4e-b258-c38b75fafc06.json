Many of the lots<br />\nwere still vacant in 1941, when<br />\nacquired from the Polish American<br />\nSavings and Loan Association by a<br />\nMr. Welsh. Much of the construction<br />\nin this area dates from post World<br />\nWar II when easy mortgage loans<br />\nmade homeownership more accessible,<br />\nand automobiles made the commute to<br />\nwork much easier.<br />\n<br />\nToday, much of the area along<br />\nMillers Island Road displays its<br />\nheritage for all to see.

Many of the lots<br />\nwere still vacant in 1941, when<br />\nacquired from the Polish American<br />\nSavings and Loan Association by a<br />\nMr. Welsh.
