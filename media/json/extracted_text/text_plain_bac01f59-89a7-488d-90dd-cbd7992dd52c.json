They<br />\nall have the long counter covered<br />\nwith green formica and the<br />\nmatching green stools that you<br />\ncan spin around on while waiting<br />\nfor your order. They all have the<br />\nsame middle-aged ladies with<br />\nexpressionless faces working in<br />\nthe same pattern day in and out.<br />\nAnd they all offer the same<br />\nbacon, lettuce, and tomato<br />\nmenufood that is decent and<br />\nyou can get quickly.<br />\nOne has a variety of fountains<br />\nto choose from in the<br />\nHomewood area. Directly across<br />\nthe street from the Milton S.<br />\n<br />\nEisenhower Library is the<br />\nGreenway Pharmacy, the caterer<br />\nto all freshman needs. Hidden in<br />\nthe back of the store, past<br />\ngreeting cards and the multiple<br />\nvitamins is the small fountain,<br />\nThe people in Greenway are<br />\nfriendly and allow you to sit at .<br />\nthe counter and ponder the<br />\nworld's problems as long as you<br />\nlike. The prices are not<br />\nspectacularly low, but are not?<br />\noutragious either.

This<br />\ndrug store allows more space for<br />\nthe fountain and has tables in<br />\naddition to the stools. The<br />\nfountain is usually too busy<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\nduring the day for any serious<br />\nthinking or relaxing, and the<br />\nprices are just a little higher than<br />\nmost fountains. The service is<br />\nquicker though, and if you are in<br />\na rush and are willing to put up<br />\nwith the noise, the Blackstone<br />\nwill suffice.<br />\nFurther up St. Paul at the<br />\ncorner of 31st is the Hopkins,<br />\nappropriately named to attract<br />\nall potential JHU customers. The<br />\nHopkins sits in a well-lit<br />\nneighborhood and the wary coed<br />\ncan venture out of her<br />\ndormitory cubicle with relatively<br />\nlittle fear of getting in trouble.<br />\nThe Hopkins fountain is a bit<br />\nquieter than the Blackstone but<br />\nis somewhat grubbier. Even the<br />\nAmerican flag on the pie case is<br />\nchipped and has finger smudges<br />\non it. The food is fair, and the<br />\nprices are average.<br />\nThe store itself is interesting<br />\nand gives the alert person a<br />\nvariety of absurdities to look<br />\nover while he eats. The magazine<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nrack in the front of the store<br />\nalso offers some real gems to<br />\nread while eating. If you care,<br />\nyou can find out \"Why Jackie<br />\nKennedy Turned Into a<br />\nSwinger,\" or \"How Shirley<br />\nJones Helped Cassidy Kick the<br />\nHabit.\" It makes for an<br />\neducating lunch break.<br />\nFor those adventurous souls<br />\nlooking for a scene right out of<br />\nDragnet, the place to go is .<br />\nPeabodys, in the heart of the<br />\nstudent slums at the infamous<br />\ncorner of North Calvert and<br />\n30th. From the sleazy and noisy<br />\natmosphere, you would expect<br />\nJack Webb to run in at any<br />\n<br />\nmoment and arrest the nodding<br />\nguy sitting next to you. An<br />\namazing conglomeration of city<br />\ndwellers frequent the store and<br />\nyou can enjoy yourself observing<br />\nthem, providing that you are in<br />\nthe 'right mood. The police are<br />\nalways in the store drinking a<br />\ncup of coffee, among other<br />\nthings, or outside in their squad<br />\ncars.<br />\nThe variety of food is small<br />\nand the prices are moderately<br />\nhigh, but it is well worth the side<br />\nshow to sit down and buy<br />\nyourself a coke and a<br />\nhamburger.<br />\n<br />\nCINEMA<br />\n<br />\nHumanities Analysts<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\n<br />\nwhat he calls \"the best<br />\ndepartment of its size in the<br />\ncountry.\" Greene claims that the<br />\nplethora of 300-level courses in<br />\nhis department are<br />\nundergraduate oriented, but not<br />\nstructured to appeal to<br />\nnon-humanities majors.<br />\n\"All students want something<br />\nthat they can sink their teeth<br />\ninto,\" Greene said.<br />\nOne department that does not<br />\nconsider itself ignored by<br />\nundergraduates is Art History.<br />\nDr. Phoebe Stanton claims her<br />\nfive-member department is filled<br />\nwith undergraduate majors and<br />\nconcentrates.<br />\n\"If we had more students, we<br />\nwould have to have more<br />\nfaculty,\" Stanton stated.<br />\nThe department chairmen<br />\nagreed that the area major has<br />\nnot been an adequate<br />\nreplacement for the<br />\ndepartmental major.<br />\n\"The area majors are vaguely<br />\noriented.

Wilson Shaffer,<br />\nDirector of the Psychological<br />\nClinic, criticized governance<br />\nreform, the planned student<br />\nunion and the admittance of<br />\nfemale undergraduates.<br />\nA former Homewood Dean<br />\nfor many years, Shaffer also<br />\ncompared the Hopkins of<br />\nYesterday with the 1971 version.<br />\nSpeaking at the last Campus<br />\nConversation for this semester,<br />\nShaffer expressed his opposition<br />\nto the recent admission of<br />\nundergraduate women. Referring<br />\nto statistics which indicate that a<br />\nhigher percentage of male<br />\ngraduates go on to Ph.D.'s and<br />\ndistinguished careers than female<br />\ngraduates, Shaffer found the<br />\nnew policy inconsistent with the<br />\nUniversity's cornmittment to<br />\nexcellence.<br />\nHe added, \"I know Women's<br />\nLib is going to get me, but<br />\nHopkins should be for men only.<br />\nUp to now, I know of no male<br />\nstudent who has had to interrupt.<br />\nhis studies because of pregnancy,<br />\nmenstruation or menopause.\"<br />\nStudent Union<br />\nCommenting on the planned<br />\nstudent union, Dr. Shaffer said<br />\nthat the $1.3 million for the total<br />\nproject could be much better<br />\nSpent. \"If the Athletic Center<br />\n<br />\nand Levering Hall were properly<br />\nset up, we would already have all<br />\nthe necessary facilities. .<br />\nShaffer added that the<br />\nUniversity's shortcomings in<br />\nsocial life would profit more<br />\nfrom \"people than new buildings<br />\nor facilities.\" He said,\"We ought<br />\nto use the $1.3 million to hire<br />\npeople who can relate to<br />\nstudents in a humanizing way.\"<br />\nWhile discussing today's<br />\nUniversity, Shaffer criticized the<br />\namount of concern given to<br />\ngovernance. \"Students should<br />\nstop worrying about faculty<br />\nappointments, which the<br />\nAdministration is best qualified<br />\nto handle, and start working<br />\ninstead for increased course<br />\nofferings from those who are<br />\ncontinually seeking to push back<br />\nthe frontiers of knowledge.\"<br />\nEnough Time<br />\nShaffer asserted, \"There is<br />\nboth time for research and for<br />\nstudents. At one time, I was<br />\nrunning the Clinic, teaching<br />\nthree courses, acting as Dean and<br />\nstill found time to publish a few<br />\nbooks and articles.\"<br />\nRecalling an older Hopkins,<br />\nShaffer noted, \"In the 1920's<br />\nthe number of cars on campus<br />\ncould fit in the Gilman Hall<br />\ntunnel.

If less<br />\nthan 50 percent of the students respond, committee<br />\nchairman Chris Ohly says, efforts for governance reform<br />\nwill be dropped. The proposed poll is at once too<br />\ncumbersome and too narrow, making it unlikely that the<br />\nStudent Council will succeed either in organizing student<br />\nsupport or gauging student opinion. The two Governance<br />\nCommit tee proposals arc variations of a powerful<br />\nstudent-faculty committee with at least the power of<br />\nreview over all Homewood policy decisions; one proposal<br />\nwould limit the committee to just veto power, while the<br />\nother would also formulate policy power. The Governance<br />\nCommittee wants to submit just these two plans, possibly<br />\nalong with the governance report that was rejected in a<br />\nreferendum last November. The resulting poll would<br />\nrequire students to plow through reams of mind-numbing<br />\nmaterial, as well as deny them the opportunity to make<br />\nother choices, such as for a true University Senate.<br />\nA better tactic would be to submit a brief, simple<br />\nquestionnaire with a variety of governance proposals,<br />\ncoupled with an intensive organizing effort by the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\n<br />\nPass-Fail<br />\nThe Academic Council's agreement to changes in<br />\nthe<br />\npass-fail system is a welcome improvement in a progr<br />\nam<br />\nthat encourages students to broaden<br />\ntheir<br />\neducation \u2014without significantly lowering acade<br />\nmic<br />\nperformance.

He has his guitar plugged<br />\ninto a small black amp and he<br />\nJust picks a few notes and<br />\nchords, keeping the band<br />\nmoving. Pot-bellied and bearded,<br />\nhis face remains totally<br />\nimpassive as he plays.<br />\nOccasionally, he responds with a<br />\nslight smile when his singer nods<br />\ntowards him.

He is not cushioned<br />\nby electricity, no jumble of \u2022<br />\n<br />\nwires coil outward to roadies<br />\nscurrying desperately from amp<br />\nto amp. It is just Roy Buchanan<br />\nand his guitar.<br />\nThirty-one years old with a<br />\nwife and six kids, the music men<br />\nhave been after him for a few<br />\nyears now and they cannot<br />\nunderstand why he is content to<br />\nplay this small-time club five<br />\nnights a week. Hendrix,<br />\nTownshend, Clapton all wanted<br />\nto jam with him. The Rolling<br />\nStones asked him to join after<br />\nBrian Jones' death and he<br />\nrefused. Clapton played John<br />\nLennon some Buchanan tapes<br />\nand the rumor was that Lennon<br />\nasked him to join the Plastic<br />\nOno Band for next year's tour.<br />\nHe has no agent or manager,<br />\nand his only public efforts have<br />\nbeen a performance for NET and<br />\nan upcoming album. After the<br />\narticle in Rolling Stone a year<br />\nago, a wider audience knows<br />\nabout him, no longer just the<br />\nsecret darling of the very great,<br />\nbut he backs away from the<br />\nmass fame that awaits him.<br />\nHe becomes a curio, and the<br />\nrock afficiandos want both to<br />\nkeep him as an elite prize and<br />\npush him towards the high<br />\nwildness of superstardom. He<br />\nhas a family, he is too unstable,<br />\nhe just likes his music; there are<br />\nmany reasons given, but still no<br />\none really knows why he won't<br />\ntake what can be his.<br />\nPerhaps he is afraid of the<br />\npressure and senses what the<br />\nhungry public can do to him.<br />\nDevouring him with our greedy<br />\nencores and screams and lights<br />\nand money, we would love to<br />\nbring him into the death-watch<br />\n<br />\nthat gave us the corpses of<br />\nHendrix, Joplin and Morrison.

I came really close to<br />\nkilling myself, but I finally<br />\ndecided that I hadn't really given<br />\nmy music all that I had\u2014I<br />\nmean\u2014I really hadn't made my<br />\nmark.\"<br />\nDuring their nightly sets from<br />\n9 pm to 2 am, Buchanan rarely<br />\ntakes extended solos, and even<br />\nwithin his own band, he does<br />\nnot act like a star. It is hard to<br />\npicture his playing to thousands<br />\nin huge arenas.<br />\n\"Once you get in the<br />\nspotlight,\" Buchanan remarks,<br />\n\"the pressure starts building and<br />\nit can really bring you down.<br />\nBesides, I've already spent too<br />\nmuch time on the road.

After all, it's a major<br />\nShakespearean tragedy, and Paul<br />\nScofield was playing the title<br />\nrole. All in all, I was<br />\ndisappointed in the way it was<br />\ndone.<br />\nScofield, playing in his first<br />\nmovie since he did Sir Thomas<br />\nMore in A Man for All Seasons,<br />\nwas great, he creates an entirely<br />\ncredible Lear, and is particularly<br />\ngood early in the presentation<br />\n<br />\nand in the concluding scene.<br />\nHis portrayal of Lear's<br />\nmadness is somewhat spoiled (as<br />\nare several other scenes) by an<br />\noverabundance of cinematic<br />\ngimmicks. Director Peter Brook<br />\ntakes far too much liberty with<br />\ncamera technique and sound<br />\neffects, especially during the<br />\nscene where Lear rages against<br />\nthe storm. The camera flashes<br />\nfrom angle to angle with<br />\ndisconcerting abruptness, and<br />\nthe sound of storm and thunder<br />\ncompete too effectively with the<br />\nmonolouge. It seemed as if the<br />\ndirector was trying to embellish<br />\nwhat Shakespeare had already<br />\nmade one of the most powerful<br />\nscenes iti --the production. He<br />\nfailed.<br />\nScofield is butressed<br />\n<br />\nthroughout the production by<br />\nvery competent performances<br />\nfrom most of the supporting<br />\ncast. Jack MacGowan's<br />\nperformance as the Fool is<br />\neverything you might wish,as he<br />\nportrays that character with all<br />\nthe power the role deserves. His<br />\ninteraction with Scofield's Lear<br />\nprovides the strongest acting<br />\nfound in the movie, with the<br />\nexception of those times when<br />\nScofield has the screen to<br />\nhimself and is unegcumbered by<br />\nPeter Brook's antics.<br />\nSome of the sub-plots in the<br />\nplay are utpl -rdevekip, \"<br />\nmovie version, perhlps ,1,.. :0<br />\ntime limitations. Edmund's dual<br />\nseduction of the eldest sisters<br />\nwas accomplished in two passing<br />\nscenes which failed entirely to<br />\n<br />\nset the stage for the girls' mutual<br />\ndestruction later in the tale.<br />\nEdmund, in fact, is perhaps the<br />\nmost maligned character in the<br />\nplay. Although the actor does a<br />\ngood job of building Edmund's<br />\nevil image, director Brook leaves<br />\nhim virtually no latitude in<br />\nwhich to work. His performance<br />\nis relegated to a series of sneers<br />\nand double-crosses which don't<br />\nallow him to make the character<br />\nnearly as powerful as have<br />\nseveral stage versions.<br />\nThe film is shot in black and<br />\nwhite, which produces the<br />\ndc,irable -effect of simplicity.<br />\nThe picture opens with a slow<br />\npan of a crowd outside the<br />\nKing's chambers, with every<br />\nperson standing very still while<br />\nthe camera focuses slowly on<br />\n<br />\neach face. The initial impression<br />\nthe viewer gets is that Brook has<br />\ndecided to use the film simply as<br />\na medium to reproduce the<br />\nactor's performances;instead, he<br />\nprogresses through a variety of<br />\nzoom shots, angle distortions<br />\nand camera changes which serve<br />\nonly to distract the viewer's<br />\nattention and detract from the<br />\nactor's performances.<br />\nThe costuming and sets for<br />\nthe movie are very convincing,<br />\nand the camera work (when it's<br />\nplayed straight) is also good.<br />\nMany of the performances are<br />\ngood, and the film rdaches high<br />\npoints during which it promises<br />\nto create an excellent<br />\nproduction of Shakespear's tale.<br />\nI just wish they would have held<br />\nthe camera steady.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 0<br />\n<br />\nDec. 3, 1971<br />\n<br />\nAsian Arts on view at Towson<br />\nBy WARDE STRINGHAM<br />\nThe Towson State College<br />\nCenter for the Asian Arts is<br />\nproviding the opportunity for<br />\nBaltimore artists and students to<br />\nbecome familiar with the<br />\nEastern cultures.<br />\nThrough purchases and gifts<br />\nTowson has accumulated an<br />\nextensive collection of Chinese,<br />\nJapanese, and Korean art dating<br />\nfrom the fourteenth century.<br />\nThe collection is being exhibited<br />\non a rotating basis in the<br />\nCollege's Cook Library and is<br />\nopen to the public from 8:00<br />\nAM to 4:00 PM daily.<br />\nThe collection included<br />\ncarved jade, scroll paintings,<br />\nporcellin, and a large number of<br />\ncarved ivory pieces. Great ingenuity is displayed in the delicate<br />\nworkman ship of these ivory<br />\ncarvings.<br />\nA particulartly fascinating<br />\nexample is the \"devil's work<br />\nball,\" which is composed of<br />\nconcentric spherical shells,<br />\ncarved one within another and<br />\nexhibiting the most intricate of<br />\npierced work. Very high degrees<br />\nof technical achievement and<br />\npatience were required to<br />\nproduce such a work, hence the<br />\nconcentric balls came to<br />\nrepresent patience and the<br />\nfortune it will bring.<br />\nAesthetic as well as technical<br />\ntriumphs are also represented, as<br />\nin the carved religious and<br />\nphilosophic figures.

Fair enough. But the<br />\ncost-benefits of dropping Agnew<br />\nand a conservative voice from<br />\n<br />\nthe Veep slot may prove to leave<br />\nhim in the red, vote-wise.

First of all, last<br />\nyear's team compiled a record of<br />\n2 wins against 9 losses. But one<br />\nof the more probably causes is<br />\nthat wrestling is a sport which<br />\nrequires a great deal of<br />\ndiscipline, hard work and<br />\ndedication. A wrestler must<br />\ncombine tremendous physical<br />\nconditioning, strength, balance<br />\nand skill in an 8 minute,<br />\none-on-one battle against his<br />\nopponent.<br />\nContrary to popular belief,<br />\nwrestling is not a sport in which<br />\nonly the giant farm-boy<br />\nheavyweight can participate.<br />\nRather, it is a sport which offers<br />\nan equal opportunity for all<br />\nboys, regardless of size, to<br />\ndemonstrate their athletic ability<br />\nand emerge as winners. There are<br />\n1 0 different weight classes<br />\nranging from 118 pounds to<br />\nunlimited. A wrestling match<br />\nconsists of one bout from each<br />\nweight division.<br />\nSiiccess<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins wrestling<br />\nteam is headed by rookie coach<br />\n<br />\nHarry Gotwals Who did his<br />\nwrestling here at Hopkins<br />\nbetween 1965 and 1968. Coach<br />\nGotwals hopes to improve upon<br />\nlast year's record and has<br />\npredicted an 8 and 5 season.<br />\nThis would be considered a<br />\nsuccess because the team is made<br />\nup of mostly freshmen and<br />\nsophomores.<br />\nCoach Gotwals said that the<br />\nboys have been working hard<br />\nsince the first of November. So<br />\nfar they have had two<br />\nscrimmages, the first against<br />\nBaltimore University last<br />\nMonday, where the grapplers<br />\ndidn't fare too well, and the<br />\nsecond scrimmage last Tuesday,<br />\nin which the Jays won about<br />\n75% of the bouts..<br />\nThe official season opens up<br />\nthis coming Wednesday at<br />\nLoyola and Coach Gotwals<br />\nbelieves that we have a good<br />\nchance to take the opener.<br />\nSaturday the 11th is the home<br />\nopener as the Blue Jay grapplers<br />\nmeet Washington College'<br />\nTwo Seasons<br />\nCoach Gotwals feels that<br />\nthere are really two seasons. He<br />\nsaid that any boy who is<br />\ninterested in wrestling, but could<br />\nnot come out in the first<br />\nsemester, is still welcome in the<br />\nsecond semester. Practice will<br />\nresume during the intersession<br />\n<br />\non January 10 and the next<br />\nmatch will be January 15.<br />\nIncidentally, Gotwals also<br />\nneeds scorekeepers, managers<br />\nand timers (co-eds welcome).<br />\nAnyone interested in these<br />\npositions should contact Coach<br />\nGotwals any weekday during<br />\npractice.<br />\nThis year's lineup will be as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n<br />\n118-Ron Pucillo-Freshman<br />\n126-Roger Brooks-Freshman<br />\n134-Craig Harvey-Freshman<br />\n142-Jeff Turshen-Senior or Bob<br />\nFink-Sophomore<br />\n150-Rick Hill-Freshman or Clark<br />\nKingery-Freshman<br />\n158-Rod Hartman-Sophomore<br />\nor Vernon Myers-Senior<br />\n167-Mel Morse\u2014Freshman or<br />\nHarry Harper-Junior<br />\n177-Craig Stevens-Sophomore<br />\n190-Neil Hazzard-Sophomore<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fDec. 3,1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nSports Potpourri<br />\n<br />\npoes<br />\n<br />\nSports:When in Doubt,Lie<br />\nBy BRUCE BORTZ<br />\nLike a great many other<br />\nAmerican men, I too had a<br />\nbellyful of turkey and sports<br />\nover the Thanksgiving vacation.<br />\nThe turkey was good, the sports<br />\nwas exciting, but the quality of<br />\nthe sportscasting was regrettably<br />\npoor.<br />\nMy favorite sportscaster was<br />\nABC's Chris Schenkel, whose<br />\nnumerous faux pas became so<br />\nirritating that during the seesaw<br />\nNebraska-Oklahoma game, I<br />\nturned the sound off. To<br />\nconsiderably understate<br />\nSchenkel's foibles, he is among<br />\nmany things a \"very cautious\"<br />\nSportscaster.<br />\nIn one memorable instance,<br />\nhe inexplicably waited some<br />\nfour seconds after a point after<br />\ntouchdown kick was signalled<br />\ngood before intoning in his<br />\ninimitable style,<br />\n\"G0000000000000d.\"<br />\nABC also saw fit to broadcast<br />\npro basketball and pro tennis<br />\nover the weekend. In NBA<br />\nbasketball, former Celtic star,<br />\nBill Russell, joined bland but<br />\ncompetent Keith Jackson in<br />\nnetwork coverage of the<br />\nAtlanta-Baltimore debacle.<br />\nRussell knows a great deal about<br />\nbasketball and probably had<br />\nmuch to say about the game,<br />\nthough I couldn't be sure, since<br />\nhe mumbled all of his incisive<br />\nobservations.<br />\nImmediately after the game,<br />\nABC broadcast the final best of<br />\nfive sets match between<br />\nAustralians Rod Laver and<br />\n<br />\nKenny Rosewall for the World<br />\nChampionship Tennis (WCT)<br />\ntitle. At stake was $50,000 for<br />\nthe winner and $20,000 for the<br />\nloser.<br />\nComments<br />\nDoing the play-by-play, if you<br />\ncan call it that, was the Boston<br />\nGlobe's Bud Collins, whose style<br />\nfeatured one word comments<br />\nthat meant nothing to the tennis<br />\nnovice. \"Topspin!\"<br />\n\"Cross-court!\" he would often<br />\nshout. If either Laver or<br />\nRosewall had heard him, they<br />\nwould have fallen on the court<br />\nlaughing.<br />\nMeanwhile, Collins' color<br />\nman, former Davis Cup Captain<br />\nDonald Dell, did well enough.<br />\nHis explanation of certain points<br />\nreplayed on the screen in slow<br />\nmotion was instructional.<br />\nSomehow, though, these replays<br />\noften ran into the next point, so<br />\nthat the viewer could only see a<br />\nball bounding into the stands<br />\nand not the smash preceding it.<br />\nIf tennis ever becomes a popular<br />\nTV sport, as I think it should,it<br />\nwill have to do better than this.<br />\nTo do better, in fact, is what<br />\nprompted JHU's Mark Leifer to<br />\nenter the field of sportscasting,<br />\nalbeit on a non-professional<br />\nnon-playing basis.<br />\nThe sophomore from Oxon<br />\nHill, Maryland, has broadcast<br />\nfootball, basketball and lacrosse<br />\nfor radio station WJHU for two<br />\nyears now. Doubling as N-L<br />\nreporter last year and editor this<br />\nyear, Mark had no previous<br />\nexperience in broadcasting<br />\n<br />\nbefore coming to Hopkins in<br />\n1970.<br />\nDo Better<br />\n\"I had followed professional<br />\nsports for a number of years and<br />\nhad sometimes felt that I could<br />\ndo better than certain<br />\nprofessional broadcasters.\"<br />\nWhen Leifer came to Hopkins,<br />\nhe found station manager and<br />\nsometime broadcaster Baird<br />\nThompson waiting to groom a<br />\nsuccessor. Mark was the only<br />\nfreshman who showed up. \"My<br />\nfirst year, I did most of the<br />\nfootball games and half of<br />\nlacrosse, though I had never seen<br />\na lacrosse game played before<br />\nthe season opened.\"<br />\nThompson took Leifer under<br />\nhis wing. \"Baird listened to some.<br />\nof the broadcasts I did and made<br />\na number of helpful suggestions.<br />\nHe told me, that, when in<br />\ndoubt\u2014lie! If you can't say who<br />\nwas carrying the ball, give<br />\nsomebody's name, and correct<br />\nyourself later if need be.<br />\nThe basic aim of the<br />\nsportscaster, Leifer contends, is<br />\nto provide a smooth continuous<br />\nflow of verbage. To \"sound<br />\ngood\" and to \"sound like you<br />\nknow what's happening\" is the<br />\nway he put it.<br />\nDifficulties<br />\nLike other broadcasters,<br />\nLeifer has had his difficulties as<br />\n<br />\nIii1rmfuhhh1uK<br />\n<br />\n\u00b0PIPIS<br />\n1\". poi<br />\n, pv.

He was<br />\ntold quite early in his career that<br />\nhe tended to scream at<br />\ninopportune times; on one<br />\noccasion, he lost his voice in the<br />\nprocess. (It turns out that Baird<br />\nThompson took this under his<br />\nwing.)<br />\nHis greatest embarrassment<br />\ncame in a 1970 Hopkins-Ursinus<br />\nfootball game he did. Ursinus, it<br />\nseems, was on the Hopkins' five<br />\nyard line with second down. A<br />\nrun took the ball to, Leifer said,<br />\nthe two yard line, but he soon<br />\nnoticed that the official was<br />\nindicating touchdown. Leifer<br />\nquickly corrected himself.<br />\nThe next play seemed to<br />\nLeifer to be a two-point<br />\nconversion. It was good. Lo and<br />\nbehold, however, the next play<br />\nwas not a kickoff as it should<br />\nhave been but rather a point<br />\nafter touchdown kick. It seernis<br />\n<br />\nthat Leifer had misinterpreted<br />\nthe official's sign of the first<br />\nplay; he was showing how far<br />\nUrsinus had to go for a<br />\ntouchdown, not that it had<br />\nscored one. Mark became so<br />\noverwrought that he finally<br />\nhanded over the mike to his<br />\ncolor man,Ingram Roberts.<br />\nOne of his principal problems<br />\nis knowing the players and their<br />\nnumbers. Consequently, he<br />\nprepares for broadcasts by<br />\nmemorizing the numbers and<br />\nnames of the starting players.<br />\n\"This is necessary so that you<br />\ncan rattle the names off without<br />\nhesitation.\"<br />\nLeifer plans to attend med<br />\nschool where he hopes to<br />\nbroadcast an appendectomy.<br />\n\"I've given some thought to<br />\nbeing a career broadcaster, but<br />\nnot much thought.\" \"The main<br />\nthing is I enjoy broadcasting.\"<br />\n<br />\nfl',\"<br />\n<br />\nNavy Nektons Beat<br />\nHopkins Swimmers<br />\nBy TOM COLEY<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins swimmers<br />\nbegan their season last<br />\nWednesday afternoon with a<br />\ndual meet at Navy and were<br />\ndefeated by a score of 82-31.<br />\nThis meet marked the first time<br />\nthat the Blue Jay swimmers have<br />\ncompeted against the perennial<br />\nEast Coast swimming power.<br />\nNavy participates in NCAA<br />\nUniversity Division swimming<br />\nand is consistently one of the<br />\ntop five teams in the East.

They<br />\nall have the long counter covered<br />\nwith green formica and the<br />\nmatching green stools that you<br />\ncan spin around on while waiting<br />\nfor your order. They all have the<br />\nsame middle-aged ladies with<br />\nexpressionless faces working in<br />\nthe same pattern day in and out.<br />\nAnd they all offer the same<br />\nbacon, lettuce, and tomato<br />\nmenufood that is decent and<br />\nyou can get quickly.<br />\nOne has a variety of fountains<br />\nto choose from in the<br />\nHomewood area. Directly across<br />\nthe street from the Milton S.<br /><br />\nEisenhower Library is the<br />\nGreenway Pharmacy, the caterer<br />\nto all freshman needs. Hidden in<br />\nthe back of the store, past<br />\ngreeting cards and the multiple<br />\nvitamins is the small fountain,<br />\nThe people in Greenway are<br />\nfriendly and allow you to sit at .<br />\nthe counter and ponder the<br />\nworld's problems as long as you<br />\nlike. The prices are not<br />\nspectacularly low, but are not?<br />\noutragious either. A sign at the<br />\ndoor advertises, \"We Deliver,\"<br />\nbut it is dubious that the<br />\ngenerosity applies to the food,<br />\nand the offer is not good after<br />\ncurfew in sectors R or M.<br />\nDown the road a piece, at the<br />\ncorner of 33rd and St. Paul, is<br />\nthe famous Blackstone<br />\nPharmacy, not to be confused<br />\nwith the equally-famous<br />\nBlackstone Dining Room. This<br />\ndrug store allows more space for<br />\nthe fountain and has tables in<br />\naddition to the stools. The<br />\nfountain is usually too busy<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\nduring the day for any serious<br />\nthinking or relaxing, and the<br />\nprices are just a little higher than<br />\nmost fountains. The service is<br />\nquicker though, and if you are in<br />\na rush and are willing to put up<br />\nwith the noise, the Blackstone<br />\nwill suffice.<br />\nFurther up St. Paul at the<br />\ncorner of 31st is the Hopkins,<br />\nappropriately named to attract<br />\nall potential JHU customers. The<br />\nHopkins sits in a well-lit<br />\nneighborhood and the wary coed<br />\ncan venture out of her<br />\ndormitory cubicle with relatively<br />\nlittle fear of getting in trouble.<br />\nThe Hopkins fountain is a bit<br />\nquieter than the Blackstone but<br />\nis somewhat grubbier. Even the<br />\nAmerican flag on the pie case is<br />\nchipped and has finger smudges<br />\non it. The food is fair, and the<br />\nprices are average.<br />\nThe store itself is interesting<br />\nand gives the alert person a<br />\nvariety of absurdities to look<br />\nover while he eats. The magazine<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nrack in the front of the store<br />\nalso offers some real gems to<br />\nread while eating. If you care,<br />\nyou can find out \"Why Jackie<br />\nKennedy Turned Into a<br />\nSwinger,\" or \"How Shirley<br />\nJones Helped Cassidy Kick the<br />\nHabit.\" It makes for an<br />\neducating lunch break.<br />\nFor those adventurous souls<br />\nlooking for a scene right out of<br />\nDragnet, the place to go is .<br />\nPeabodys, in the heart of the<br />\nstudent slums at the infamous<br />\ncorner of North Calvert and<br />\n30th. From the sleazy and noisy<br />\natmosphere, you would expect<br />\nJack Webb to run in at any<br /><br />\nmoment and arrest the nodding<br />\nguy sitting next to you. An<br />\namazing conglomeration of city<br />\ndwellers frequent the store and<br />\nyou can enjoy yourself observing<br />\nthem, providing that you are in<br />\nthe 'right mood. The police are<br />\nalways in the store drinking a<br />\ncup of coffee, among other<br />\nthings, or outside in their squad<br />\ncars.<br />\nThe variety of food is small<br />\nand the prices are moderately<br />\nhigh, but it is well worth the side<br />\nshow to sit down and buy<br />\nyourself a coke and a<br />\nhamburger.<br /><br />\nCINEMA<br /><br />\nHumanities Analysts<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br /><br />\nwhat he calls \"the best<br />\ndepartment of its size in the<br />\ncountry.\" Greene claims that the<br />\nplethora of 300-level courses in<br />\nhis department are<br />\nundergraduate oriented, but not<br />\nstructured to appeal to<br />\nnon-humanities majors.<br />\n\"All students want something<br />\nthat they can sink their teeth<br />\ninto,\" Greene said.<br />\nOne department that does not<br />\nconsider itself ignored by<br />\nundergraduates is Art History.<br />\nDr. Phoebe Stanton claims her<br />\nfive-member department is filled<br />\nwith undergraduate majors and<br />\nconcentrates.<br />\n\"If we had more students, we<br />\nwould have to have more<br />\nfaculty,\" Stanton stated.<br />\nThe department chairmen<br />\nagreed that the area major has<br />\nnot been an adequate<br />\nreplacement for the<br />\ndepartmental major.<br />\n\"The area majors are vaguely<br />\noriented.

Wilson Shaffer,<br />\nDirector of the Psychological<br />\nClinic, criticized governance<br />\nreform, the planned student<br />\nunion and the admittance of<br />\nfemale undergraduates.<br />\nA former Homewood Dean<br />\nfor many years, Shaffer also<br />\ncompared the Hopkins of<br />\nYesterday with the 1971 version.<br />\nSpeaking at the last Campus<br />\nConversation for this semester,<br />\nShaffer expressed his opposition<br />\nto the recent admission of<br />\nundergraduate women. Referring<br />\nto statistics which indicate that a<br />\nhigher percentage of male<br />\ngraduates go on to Ph.D.'s and<br />\ndistinguished careers than female<br />\ngraduates, Shaffer found the<br />\nnew policy inconsistent with the<br />\nUniversity's cornmittment to<br />\nexcellence.<br />\nHe added, \"I know Women's<br />\nLib is going to get me, but<br />\nHopkins should be for men only.<br />\nUp to now, I know of no male<br />\nstudent who has had to interrupt.<br />\nhis studies because of pregnancy,<br />\nmenstruation or menopause.\"<br />\nStudent Union<br />\nCommenting on the planned<br />\nstudent union, Dr. Shaffer said<br />\nthat the $1.3 million for the total<br />\nproject could be much better<br />\nSpent. \"If the Athletic Center<br /><br />\nand Levering Hall were properly<br />\nset up, we would already have all<br />\nthe necessary facilities. .<br />\nShaffer added that the<br />\nUniversity's shortcomings in<br />\nsocial life would profit more<br />\nfrom \"people than new buildings<br />\nor facilities.\" He said,\"We ought<br />\nto use the $1.3 million to hire<br />\npeople who can relate to<br />\nstudents in a humanizing way.\"<br />\nWhile discussing today's<br />\nUniversity, Shaffer criticized the<br />\namount of concern given to<br />\ngovernance. \"Students should<br />\nstop worrying about faculty<br />\nappointments, which the<br />\nAdministration is best qualified<br />\nto handle, and start working<br />\ninstead for increased course<br />\nofferings from those who are<br />\ncontinually seeking to push back<br />\nthe frontiers of knowledge.\"<br />\nEnough Time<br />\nShaffer asserted, \"There is<br />\nboth time for research and for<br />\nstudents. At one time, I was<br />\nrunning the Clinic, teaching<br />\nthree courses, acting as Dean and<br />\nstill found time to publish a few<br />\nbooks and articles.\"<br />\nRecalling an older Hopkins,<br />\nShaffer noted, \"In the 1920's<br />\nthe number of cars on campus<br />\ncould fit in the Gilman Hall<br />\ntunnel. Goucher was only eleven<br />\nblocks away then.

Shaffer<br />\nattributed the recent rash of<br />\nsexual problems to the increased<br />\n\"permissivity\" and the<br />\n\"scorecard\" approach<br />\nexemplified by doubts like \"Was<br />\nI better today than I was<br />\nyesterday?\"<br /><br />\nG.

If less<br />\nthan 50 percent of the students respond, committee<br />\nchairman Chris Ohly says, efforts for governance reform<br />\nwill be dropped. The proposed poll is at once too<br />\ncumbersome and too narrow, making it unlikely that the<br />\nStudent Council will succeed either in organizing student<br />\nsupport or gauging student opinion. The two Governance<br />\nCommit tee proposals arc variations of a powerful<br />\nstudent-faculty committee with at least the power of<br />\nreview over all Homewood policy decisions; one proposal<br />\nwould limit the committee to just veto power, while the<br />\nother would also formulate policy power. The Governance<br />\nCommittee wants to submit just these two plans, possibly<br />\nalong with the governance report that was rejected in a<br />\nreferendum last November. The resulting poll would<br />\nrequire students to plow through reams of mind-numbing<br />\nmaterial, as well as deny them the opportunity to make<br />\nother choices, such as for a true University Senate.<br />\nA better tactic would be to submit a brief, simple<br />\nquestionnaire with a variety of governance proposals,<br />\ncoupled with an intensive organizing effort by the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br /><br />\nPass-Fail<br />\nThe Academic Council's agreement to changes in<br />\nthe<br />\npass-fail system is a welcome improvement in a progr<br />\nam<br />\nthat encourages students to broaden<br />\ntheir<br />\neducation \u2014without significantly lowering acade<br />\nmic<br />\nperformance.

After all, it's a major<br />\nShakespearean tragedy, and Paul<br />\nScofield was playing the title<br />\nrole. All in all, I was<br />\ndisappointed in the way it was<br />\ndone.<br />\nScofield, playing in his first<br />\nmovie since he did Sir Thomas<br />\nMore in A Man for All Seasons,<br />\nwas great, he creates an entirely<br />\ncredible Lear, and is particularly<br />\ngood early in the presentation<br /><br />\nand in the concluding scene.<br />\nHis portrayal of Lear's<br />\nmadness is somewhat spoiled (as<br />\nare several other scenes) by an<br />\noverabundance of cinematic<br />\ngimmicks. Director Peter Brook<br />\ntakes far too much liberty with<br />\ncamera technique and sound<br />\neffects, especially during the<br />\nscene where Lear rages against<br />\nthe storm. The camera flashes<br />\nfrom angle to angle with<br />\ndisconcerting abruptness, and<br />\nthe sound of storm and thunder<br />\ncompete too effectively with the<br />\nmonolouge. It seemed as if the<br />\ndirector was trying to embellish<br />\nwhat Shakespeare had already<br />\nmade one of the most powerful<br />\nscenes iti --the production. He<br />\nfailed.<br />\nScofield is butressed<br /><br />\nthroughout the production by<br />\nvery competent performances<br />\nfrom most of the supporting<br />\ncast. Jack MacGowan's<br />\nperformance as the Fool is<br />\neverything you might wish,as he<br />\nportrays that character with all<br />\nthe power the role deserves. His<br />\ninteraction with Scofield's Lear<br />\nprovides the strongest acting<br />\nfound in the movie, with the<br />\nexception of those times when<br />\nScofield has the screen to<br />\nhimself and is unegcumbered by<br />\nPeter Brook's antics.<br />\nSome of the sub-plots in the<br />\nplay are utpl -rdevekip, \"<br />\nmovie version, perhlps ,1,.. :0<br />\ntime limitations.

Although the actor does a<br />\ngood job of building Edmund's<br />\nevil image, director Brook leaves<br />\nhim virtually no latitude in<br />\nwhich to work. His performance<br />\nis relegated to a series of sneers<br />\nand double-crosses which don't<br />\nallow him to make the character<br />\nnearly as powerful as have<br />\nseveral stage versions.<br />\nThe film is shot in black and<br />\nwhite, which produces the<br />\ndc,irable -effect of simplicity.<br />\nThe picture opens with a slow<br />\npan of a crowd outside the<br />\nKing's chambers, with every<br />\nperson standing very still while<br />\nthe camera focuses slowly on<br /><br />\neach face. The initial impression<br />\nthe viewer gets is that Brook has<br />\ndecided to use the film simply as<br />\na medium to reproduce the<br />\nactor's performances;instead, he<br />\nprogresses through a variety of<br />\nzoom shots, angle distortions<br />\nand camera changes which serve<br />\nonly to distract the viewer's<br />\nattention and detract from the<br />\nactor's performances.<br />\nThe costuming and sets for<br />\nthe movie are very convincing,<br />\nand the camera work (when it's<br />\nplayed straight) is also good.<br />\nMany of the performances are<br />\ngood, and the film rdaches high<br />\npoints during which it promises<br />\nto create an excellent<br />\nproduction of Shakespear's tale.<br />\nI just wish they would have held<br />\nthe camera steady.<br /><br />\nPAGE 0<br /><br />\nDec. 3, 1971<br /><br />\nAsian Arts on view at Towson<br />\nBy WARDE STRINGHAM<br />\nThe Towson State College<br />\nCenter for the Asian Arts is<br />\nproviding the opportunity for<br />\nBaltimore artists and students to<br />\nbecome familiar with the<br />\nEastern cultures.<br />\nThrough purchases and gifts<br />\nTowson has accumulated an<br />\nextensive collection of Chinese,<br />\nJapanese, and Korean art dating<br />\nfrom the fourteenth century.<br />\nThe collection is being exhibited<br />\non a rotating basis in the<br />\nCollege's Cook Library and is<br />\nopen to the public from 8:00<br />\nAM to 4:00 PM daily.<br />\nThe collection included<br />\ncarved jade, scroll paintings,<br />\nporcellin, and a large number of<br />\ncarved ivory pieces.

The<br />\nTigers scored the first six points<br />\nof the evening and never trailed<br />\nas the Blue Jays started slowly<br />\nand encountered difficulty in<br />\ngetting untracked in this first<br />\ngame of the 1971-72 season for<br />\nboth teams.<br />\nLast night's Blue Jay loss<br />\nmarked the unveiling of the<br />\nsecond edition of Coach Gary<br />\nRupert's team, a squad that has<br />\nbeen acclaimed as vastly<br />\nimproved over last year's 10-13<br />\noutfit that finished second in the<br />\nsire'<br /><br />\nJohn Rutter<br />\nMAC playoffs. The big question<br />\nmark hovering over ,the team,<br />\naccording to Rupert, has been<br />\nthe comparative inexperience of<br />\na squad carrying nine<br /><br />\nsophomores, one freshman, and<br />\nonly one senior. This weakness<br />\nwas rather apparent on the court<br />\nlast night.<br />\n\"We're young; we sometimes<br />\ngave up on offense too soon,\"<br />\nthe Coach remarked after the<br />\ngame. \"We made a lot of<br />\nmistakes, but nothing that<br />\ncannot be corrected.\"<br />\nLeading the way offensively<br />\nfor Hopkins was highly touted<br />\nsophomore Bill Jews, who hit<br />\nfor a game-high 29 points.

Commenting on Jews'<br />\napparent difficulty in<br />\nrebounding (he pulled down<br />\nseven in all), he observed, \"It's<br />\njust an adjustment he'll have to<br />\nmake.\" Rupert in fact pointed<br />\nout that the entire team will<br />\nhave to make such adjustments<br />\nduring the balance of the season.<br />\n\"In freshman ball you don't<br />\nhave to block out, but in varsity<br />\nball you have to learn how to do<br />\nit.\"<br />\nThe Tigers shut out Hopkins<br />\nfor the first five minutes of the<br />\ngame while building up a 6-0<br />\nlead before guard Bob Freedman<br />\nbroke the scoring ice with a<br />\njumper from the top of the key.<br />\nThe Jays pulled within five at<br />\n10-5 with 12:36 to go in the<br />\nfirst half on a Doug Campbell<br />\nfree throw, but a run of four<br />\nTowson baskets broke the game<br />\nopen with . only ten minutes<br />\ngone.

First of all, last<br />\nyear's team compiled a record of<br />\n2 wins against 9 losses. But one<br />\nof the more probably causes is<br />\nthat wrestling is a sport which<br />\nrequires a great deal of<br />\ndiscipline, hard work and<br />\ndedication. A wrestler must<br />\ncombine tremendous physical<br />\nconditioning, strength, balance<br />\nand skill in an 8 minute,<br />\none-on-one battle against his<br />\nopponent.<br />\nContrary to popular belief,<br />\nwrestling is not a sport in which<br />\nonly the giant farm-boy<br />\nheavyweight can participate.<br />\nRather, it is a sport which offers<br />\nan equal opportunity for all<br />\nboys, regardless of size, to<br />\ndemonstrate their athletic ability<br />\nand emerge as winners. There are<br />\n1 0 different weight classes<br />\nranging from 118 pounds to<br />\nunlimited. A wrestling match<br />\nconsists of one bout from each<br />\nweight division.<br />\nSiiccess<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins wrestling<br />\nteam is headed by rookie coach<br /><br />\nHarry Gotwals Who did his<br />\nwrestling here at Hopkins<br />\nbetween 1965 and 1968. Coach<br />\nGotwals hopes to improve upon<br />\nlast year's record and has<br />\npredicted an 8 and 5 season.<br />\nThis would be considered a<br />\nsuccess because the team is made<br />\nup of mostly freshmen and<br />\nsophomores.<br />\nCoach Gotwals said that the<br />\nboys have been working hard<br />\nsince the first of November. So<br />\nfar they have had two<br />\nscrimmages, the first against<br />\nBaltimore University last<br />\nMonday, where the grapplers<br />\ndidn't fare too well, and the<br />\nsecond scrimmage last Tuesday,<br />\nin which the Jays won about<br />\n75% of the bouts..<br />\nThe official season opens up<br />\nthis coming Wednesday at<br />\nLoyola and Coach Gotwals<br />\nbelieves that we have a good<br />\nchance to take the opener.<br />\nSaturday the 11th is the home<br />\nopener as the Blue Jay grapplers<br />\nmeet Washington College'<br />\nTwo Seasons<br />\nCoach Gotwals feels that<br />\nthere are really two seasons. He<br />\nsaid that any boy who is<br />\ninterested in wrestling, but could<br />\nnot come out in the first<br />\nsemester, is still welcome in the<br />\nsecond semester. Practice will<br />\nresume during the intersession<br /><br />\non January 10 and the next<br />\nmatch will be January 15.<br />\nIncidentally, Gotwals also<br />\nneeds scorekeepers, managers<br />\nand timers (co-eds welcome).<br />\nAnyone interested in these<br />\npositions should contact Coach<br />\nGotwals any weekday during<br />\npractice.<br />\nThis year's lineup will be as<br />\nfollows:<br /><br />\n118-Ron Pucillo-Freshman<br />\n126-Roger Brooks-Freshman<br />\n134-Craig Harvey-Freshman<br />\n142-Jeff Turshen-Senior or Bob<br />\nFink-Sophomore<br />\n150-Rick Hill-Freshman or Clark<br />\nKingery-Freshman<br />\n158-Rod Hartman-Sophomore<br />\nor Vernon Myers-Senior<br />\n167-Mel Morse\u2014Freshman or<br />\nHarry Harper-Junior<br />\n177-Craig Stevens-Sophomore<br />\n190-Neil Hazzard-Sophomore<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nDec. 3,1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nSports Potpourri<br /><br />\npoes<br /><br />\nSports:When in Doubt,Lie<br />\nBy BRUCE BORTZ<br />\nLike a great many other<br />\nAmerican men, I too had a<br />\nbellyful of turkey and sports<br />\nover the Thanksgiving vacation.<br />\nThe turkey was good, the sports<br />\nwas exciting, but the quality of<br />\nthe sportscasting was regrettably<br />\npoor.<br />\nMy favorite sportscaster was<br />\nABC's Chris Schenkel, whose<br />\nnumerous faux pas became so<br />\nirritating that during the seesaw<br />\nNebraska-Oklahoma game, I<br />\nturned the sound off.

If either Laver or<br />\nRosewall had heard him, they<br />\nwould have fallen on the court<br />\nlaughing.<br />\nMeanwhile, Collins' color<br />\nman, former Davis Cup Captain<br />\nDonald Dell, did well enough.<br />\nHis explanation of certain points<br />\nreplayed on the screen in slow<br />\nmotion was instructional.<br />\nSomehow, though, these replays<br />\noften ran into the next point, so<br />\nthat the viewer could only see a<br />\nball bounding into the stands<br />\nand not the smash preceding it.<br />\nIf tennis ever becomes a popular<br />\nTV sport, as I think it should,it<br />\nwill have to do better than this.<br />\nTo do better, in fact, is what<br />\nprompted JHU's Mark Leifer to<br />\nenter the field of sportscasting,<br />\nalbeit on a non-professional<br />\nnon-playing basis.<br />\nThe sophomore from Oxon<br />\nHill, Maryland, has broadcast<br />\nfootball, basketball and lacrosse<br />\nfor radio station WJHU for two<br />\nyears now. Doubling as N-L<br />\nreporter last year and editor this<br />\nyear, Mark had no previous<br />\nexperience in broadcasting<br /><br />\nbefore coming to Hopkins in<br />\n1970.<br />\nDo Better<br />\n\"I had followed professional<br />\nsports for a number of years and<br />\nhad sometimes felt that I could<br />\ndo better than certain<br />\nprofessional broadcasters.\"<br />\nWhen Leifer came to Hopkins,<br />\nhe found station manager and<br />\nsometime broadcaster Baird<br />\nThompson waiting to groom a<br />\nsuccessor. Mark was the only<br />\nfreshman who showed up. \"My<br />\nfirst year, I did most of the<br />\nfootball games and half of<br />\nlacrosse, though I had never seen<br />\na lacrosse game played before<br />\nthe season opened.\"<br />\nThompson took Leifer under<br />\nhis wing. \"Baird listened to some.<br />\nof the broadcasts I did and made<br />\na number of helpful suggestions.<br />\nHe told me, that, when in<br />\ndoubt\u2014lie! If you can't say who<br />\nwas carrying the ball, give<br />\nsomebody's name, and correct<br />\nyourself later if need be.<br />\nThe basic aim of the<br />\nsportscaster, Leifer contends, is<br />\nto provide a smooth continuous<br />\nflow of verbage. To \"sound<br />\ngood\" and to \"sound like you<br />\nknow what's happening\" is the<br />\nway he put it.<br />\nDifficulties<br />\nLike other broadcasters,<br />\nLeifer has had his difficulties as<br /><br />\nIii1rmfuhhh1uK<br /><br />\n\u00b0PIPIS<br />\n1\". poi<br />\n, pv.

He was<br />\ntold quite early in his career that<br />\nhe tended to scream at<br />\ninopportune times; on one<br />\noccasion, he lost his voice in the<br />\nprocess. (It turns out that Baird<br />\nThompson took this under his<br />\nwing.)<br />\nHis greatest embarrassment<br />\ncame in a 1970 Hopkins-Ursinus<br />\nfootball game he did. Ursinus, it<br />\nseems, was on the Hopkins' five<br />\nyard line with second down. A<br />\nrun took the ball to, Leifer said,<br />\nthe two yard line, but he soon<br />\nnoticed that the official was<br />\nindicating touchdown. Leifer<br />\nquickly corrected himself.<br />\nThe next play seemed to<br />\nLeifer to be a two-point<br />\nconversion. It was good. Lo and<br />\nbehold, however, the next play<br />\nwas not a kickoff as it should<br />\nhave been but rather a point<br />\nafter touchdown kick. It seernis<br /><br />\nthat Leifer had misinterpreted<br />\nthe official's sign of the first<br />\nplay; he was showing how far<br />\nUrsinus had to go for a<br />\ntouchdown, not that it had<br />\nscored one. Mark became so<br />\noverwrought that he finally<br />\nhanded over the mike to his<br />\ncolor man,Ingram Roberts.<br />\nOne of his principal problems<br />\nis knowing the players and their<br />\nnumbers. Consequently, he<br />\nprepares for broadcasts by<br />\nmemorizing the numbers and<br />\nnames of the starting players.<br />\n\"This is necessary so that you<br />\ncan rattle the names off without<br />\nhesitation.\"<br />\nLeifer plans to attend med<br />\nschool where he hopes to<br />\nbroadcast an appendectomy.<br />\n\"I've given some thought to<br />\nbeing a career broadcaster, but<br />\nnot much thought.\" \"The main<br />\nthing is I enjoy broadcasting.\"<br /><br />\nfl',\"<br /><br />\nNavy Nektons Beat<br />\nHopkins Swimmers<br />\nBy TOM COLEY<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins swimmers<br />\nbegan their season last<br />\nWednesday afternoon with a<br />\ndual meet at Navy and were<br />\ndefeated by a score of 82-31.<br />\nThis meet marked the first time<br />\nthat the Blue Jay swimmers have<br />\ncompeted against the perennial<br />\nEast Coast swimming power.<br />\nNavy participates in NCAA<br />\nUniversity Division swimming<br />\nand is consistently one of the<br />\ntop five teams in the East.
