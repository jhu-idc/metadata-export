To facilitate<br />\nthis, Brown said, no staff<br />\nmembers are authorized \u2022 or<br />\ninterested - in publicizing of<br />\nreporting and operation or<br />\nconsultation to parents, friends,<br />\nor other officials.

The<br />\nROTC program however which<br />\nhad previously been in danger of<br />\narmy cancellation due to the<br />\ncontinuing decrease in<br />\nenrollment will benefit from the,<br />\ngeneral cutback in military<br />\npersonnel.<br />\nOne sophomore whose<br />\neligibility starts next January said<br />\nhe was joining ROTC strictly as a<br />\nsafety measure.<br />\nColonel Eleazor Parmly noted<br />\n\"Most of the people who joined<br />\nlast January have stayed in.\"<br />\nThey are still eligible for the<br />\ndraft until the end of this year.<br />\nParmly mentioned that whether<br />\nor not hey stay in the program<br />\nafter their year of eligibility is up<br />\nwill be indicative of trend under<br />\nthe lottery system.<br />\nThe decrease in ROTC<br />\nenrollment in the last few years<br />\nwill not have a destructive effect<br />\n<br />\nColonel Parmly<br />\non the Flopkins program,<br />\naccording to Parmly. \"The<br />\nmeasure of a viable program is<br />\nhow many commissions awarded,<br />\n\" said Parmly. The official army<br />\npolicy requires an average of 25<br />\nmen a year for five years. But<br />\naccording to Parmly they have<br />\nsaid they will accept 15 a year.<br />\nAlthough this year's senior class<br />\nhas only 10 cadets last year's<br />\nclass numbered 19 and the year<br />\nbefore was 28. \"We've been<br />\n<br />\ndoing more than necessary,\"<br />\nParmly declared.<br />\nParmly .observed the fact that<br />\nonly 30% of ROTC cadets had<br />\nbeen awarded commissions last<br />\nyear. The other 70% were<br />\nassigned to the reserves or to the<br />\nNational Guard. The general<br />\ndecrease in the number of<br />\nmilitary personnel was given as<br />\nthe reason for. the lack of<br />\npositions for the ROTC<br />\ngraduates. \"The army is getting'<br />\nsmaller,\" Parmly commented.<br />\nIf a volunteer army is initiated<br />\nthe ROTC program will probably<br />\ncontinue. Parmly presented the<br />\nscholarship program as a major<br />\nincentive for recruitment. In<br />\naddition he speculated there will<br />\nbe those who are interested in<br />\nentering military service through<br />\nthe ROTC program. \"From now<br />\non the guys in the ROTC<br />\nprogram will be in because they<br />\nwant to be in. The way it is now<br />\nwe can expect a 50% drop-uut<br />\nrate,\" said Parmly.<br />\n<br />\nLack of funds hinders Union<br />\nBy ALVIN STEIN<br />\nLack of funds from the<br />\nDepartment of Housing and<br />\nUrban Development . and the<br />\nabsence of-architectural plans are<br />\nhindering the construction of the<br />\nnew student union.<br />\nAccording to Director of the<br />\nHopkins Union, Jim Sydnor,<br />\n\"The construction of the union<br />\nwill be held up until we receive<br />\ncomplete drawings from the<br />\narchitect.\" The plans for the<br />\nunion were to be completed by<br />\nSeptember 11, but they have not<br />\nyet been submitted.

Current<br />\nestimates are that 50% of the<br />\nUndergraduate student body cheats<br />\nregularly on exams and papers. By<br />\ncheating, I am not referring to<br />\nconsultation on take home exams. I am<br />\nreferring to plagiarism in the form of<br />\ncopying answers during exams, passing<br />\ntests back and forth and coming into<br />\nexams with \"prepared\" exam booklets.<br />\nLast semester I was qi an exam when a<br />\ntorrectecl<br />\nLiaatit_<br />\nby<br />\nthe<br />\n,,tessor anu men<br />\nthc. rtNr\u2018t,<br />\n1s.<br />\n<br />\neference material for his not yet finished<br />\nfiends.<br />\nBet'ore I continue, a brief explanation<br />\n)f how the Honor Commission is<br />\n;upposed to work is in order. The<br />\n2ommission is a self .perpetuating group<br />\n.)1. twenty-two students. When an Honor<br />\nviolation is spotted by either a student or<br />\nFaculty member, the Commission is given<br />\nthat student's name (the cheater) and the<br />\ncircumstances involved. It' the<br />\nCommission decides that there is enough<br />\nevidence to suspect the strident of<br />\ncheating then he is brought to trial. If<br />\nfound guilty, the punishment varies but<br />\nthe Commission does have the power to<br />\nexpel( a student. It is interesting to note<br />\nthat throughout the entire trial the<br />\naccused student never sees or for that<br />\nmatter knows who he is being accused<br />\nby. Actually, the processes of the<br />\nHonor CoMmission are fairly simple, but<br />\nthe Commission is faced with year after<br />\nyear of inactivity and it isn't due to a lack<br />\n-of cheating.<br />\nThe Honor Code isn't working for<br />\nmany reason. The main reason is that the<br />\nstudents aren't responding to their duties<br />\nunder the Code. In order for the Honor<br />\nCode to work,students must be willing to<br />\nturn in their fellow students when they<br />\nfind them cheating.<br />\nAdmittedly this is not a pleasant or<br />\nany easy task. I myself have seen<br />\nhundreds of students cheating and have<br />\nyet to turn anybody in to the Honor<br />\n<br />\nCommission. It's pretty difficult to turn<br />\nsomeone in you don't know,and what do<br />\nyou do when a friend is seen cheating?<br />\nAs I see it, the students at Hopkins are<br />\nfaced with a dilemma. They must choose<br />\nbetween two unhealthy situations: Either<br />\nthey begin to turn their fellow students in<br />\nto the Honor Commission for violations,<br />\nor the Code will be terminated and we<br />\nreturn to the proctored exam system and<br />\nother atrocities.<br />\nIf the Honor Code is dissolved, then<br />\nthe following things will happen: The<br />\nfirst is that Professors will gradually<br />\nreturn to the proctored exam. For those<br />\nof you who have never been in a<br />\nproctored exam, let me assure you that it<br />\nis unpleasant. The next thing that will<br />\nhappen (and in my opinion this is much<br />\nmore important) is that if a professor<br />\naccuses a student of cheating, the student<br />\nhas no recourse whatsoever. He cannot<br />\nappeal the decision. If the Professor<br />\nwants to flunk him out of the course,<br />\nthen he flunks and thats that. In short,<br />\nthe Honor Code offers the student<br />\nprotection and prevents an arbitrary<br />\n<br />\nHonor at Hopkins. I would much rather<br />\ngo back to proctored exams then<br />\ncontinue fooling ourselves that we have<br />\nan Honor Code at Hopkins.<br />\nI don't like the idea of students<br />\nreporting their fellow students for Honor<br />\nCode violations but I feel it must be<br />\ndone. Unfortunately it may be too late<br />\nfor even this to occur.<br />\nThe issue is now in that hands of what<br />\nI consider to be a very responsible<br />\nStudent Council. If they decide to vote<br />\ndown the revised Honor Code<br />\nConstitution and then call the old one up<br />\nfor revision and decide against that one as<br />\nwell, then its all over. The Honor<br />\nCommission ceases to function as of that<br />\nvote.<br />\nMy advice to the Student Council is to<br />\ngive the Honor Code one more chance to<br />\nwork. If they accept the revisions, then<br />\nit's up to the Honor Commission to get<br />\nthe students and the faculty to make it<br />\nwork. Personally, I think that this is a<br />\npossibility. Honor codes are working at<br />\nother Universities, although most face the<br />\nsame problem as Hopkins.<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nV 1 IA<br />\n<br />\nla...<br />\n<br />\nII 1<br />\n<br />\nVSS<br />\n<br />\nN.VikA.N.<br />\n<br />\nthat the<br />\nstudents want to keep the Honor Code. I<br />\nknow the faculty wants to keep the<br />\nHonor Code, yet neither of these two<br />\ngroups are willing to make the Code<br />\nwork. I have yet to have a Professor<br />\nmention the existence of the Code.<br />\nStudents refuse to turn in other students;<br />\nand up until now, no one \u2022 even wants to<br />\ndiscuss the issue.<br />\nI feel that abolishing the Honor Code<br />\nwould be a giant step backwards at<br />\nHopkins. I also believe that we cannot<br />\ncontinue to operate under the sham of<br />\non the snot polls, I am convinced<br />\n<br />\n1 II<br />\n<br />\ns<br />\n<br />\nthen 1 can almost guarantee this will he<br />\nthe last year for the Honor Code at Johns<br />\nHopkins. Hopkins without an Honor<br />\nCode will be a much changed Hopkins,<br />\nand it will be a sad thing to see.<br />\nRight now it's up to the Student<br />\nCouncil, and it will be interesting to see<br />\nwhat they decide to do. I hope they<br />\naccept the new Constitution and give the<br />\nCode one more try.<br />\nOpinion is everybody's voice in the<br />\nNews-Letter. Send typewritten copy to<br />\nbox 1230.

The problem over the<br />\nyears has remained constant how to<br />\nencourage national, ethnic and racial<br />\npride through athletic competition<br />\nwithout permitting political nationalism<br />\nto reign in the name of sport.<br />\nThe glaring problem now appears<br />\nunsolvable. It always has. Political<br />\ntensions have always entered the Olympic<br />\nsports arena.

For on October 1st, he will become<br />\nresponsible for the direction of the hospital in addition<br />\nto the University he already heads. He will be unable<br />\nto duck controversies between the medical school and<br />\nthe hospital by saying, \"Talk to the hospital people,\"<br />\nbut will instead have to meditate the controversies<br />\nhimself.

With his new<br />\npower, Muller can do much to alleviate these problems<br />\nbecause he will be in charge of all of Hopkins, not just<br />\nthe University. It is true that both the medical schools<br />\nand the hospital are expanding, with the establishment<br />\nof an Allied Health School and the East Baltimore and<br />\nColumbia Medical Plans. His dual role will allow him<br />\nto lead the whole East Baltimore complex in the<br />\nimprovement of medical research and care.

Kelso Morrill, a man for all seasons<br />\nBy NILS BRUBAKER<br />\nTwo great traditions at<br />\nHopkins are lacrosse and<br />\nscholastics, and one man who<br />\nexemplified excellence in both:<br />\nwas W. Kelso Morrill, Sr. Morrill;<br />\ndevoted his entire adult life to<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nArriving at the university fresh<br />\nout of City College in 1921, he<br />\nnever left up until the day he<br />\ndied in 1968. He received his B.A.<br />\n('29), all at Hopkins. As a<br />\ngraduate student he acted as a<br />\nteaching assistant in<br />\nmathematics, as well as playing<br />\nfor two national champion<br />\nlacrosse teams. He became coach<br />\nfor the team in 1931 and served<br />\nuntil 1951, during which time<br />\nHopkins won or tied for five<br />\nnational championships. He was<br />\nnamed Associate Professor of<br />\nMathematics in 1950, Director of<br />\nStudent Activities in 1951, and<br />\nbecame the first Dean of<br />\nStudents at JHU in 1959.<br />\nFor Dr. Morrill these offices<br />\nwere more than just a list of<br />\ntitles. Dean Shaffer, probably his<br />\nclosest friend at Hopkins,<br />\nremembered him \" primarily for<br />\nhis interest in people. \" He<br />\ndisplayed this interest with every<br />\nstudent he dealt with. His office<br />\nin the White House was always<br />\nopen to any student, for any<br />\nreason. His former secretary, Mrs.<br />\nGerrie UPoint, recalls that at<br />\nlunchtime each day Dr. Morrill<br />\n<br />\nwould eat in his office, correcting<br />\nthe mistakes of three or four<br />\nstudents doing problems on the<br />\nchalkboards lining the walls of<br />\nthe room. His policy was never<br />\nflunk a student who came<br />\npersonally to him for help, and<br />\nhe always gave his students the<br />\nbenefit of the doubt on<br />\nborderline grades.<br />\nAdministrator<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAs an administrator he did his<br />\nbest to help the students. He<br />\ndevised a new freshman advising<br />\nprogram, and met frequently<br />\nwith faculty advisors to iron out<br />\nproblems. A member of Kappa<br />\nAlpha Order, he was strongly in<br />\nfavor of fraternities at Hopkins,<br />\nand as their administrative liaison<br />\nwith the school and community,<br />\nconstantly strove to upgrade<br />\nfraternity life. Sometimes such<br />\nduties took him to the Baltimore<br />\nCity Jail to bail out some poor<br />\nmisguided I loppie suffering from<br />\nthe after-effects of weekend<br />\nrevelry.<br />\nStudents readily appreciated<br />\nhis concern for their welfare.<br />\nLong-departed alumni always<br />\nremembered Morrill and many<br />\nwrote him letters. One Christmas<br />\nlate in his life, when he was laid<br />\nup in the hospital, the university<br />\nGlee Club dropped by his room<br />\nto sing carols. Ile was so moved<br />\nby their display of appreciation<br />\nand care for him, he later<br />\nadmitted to his secretary,<br />\n<br />\nsomewhat embarrassed, that he<br />\nhad cried.<br />\nPerfect<br />\nHis style of teaching also<br />\ndeserved his students'<br />\nappreciation. He taught calculus<br />\nwith fervor and energy. His tall<br />\nstature, booming voice, and feel<br />\nfor personal contact compelled<br />\nevery student to actively learn<br />\nthe material. When a confused<br />\nstudent was not sure how to do 'a<br />\nproblem, Dr. Morrill would<br />\ncarefully watch him diagram it<br />\non the board. If he made a<br />\nmistake, Morrill would bellow,<br />\n\"What are you doing?!\" After<br />\npointing out the mistake, and<br />\nafter the student had sone the<br />\nproblem correctly, Morrill would<br />\nlight up, lift his arms into the air<br />\nand respond, \"Perfect.<br />\nPERFECT! What's your<br />\nproblem? You've got it!\" Many<br />\nstudents perhaps were<br />\nintimidated by his energetic<br />\nmanner, though it always<br />\nsurprised Dr. Morrill when he<br />\nheard about it. Nonetheless, few<br />\nstudents ever left him with only a<br />\nvague understanding of what<br />\nthey were doing. Dr. Morrill<br />\nwould not let them.<br />\nJudas Priest<br />\nIf he was passionate in his<br />\nefforts at teaching, Kelso Morrill<br />\nwas even more passionate in his<br />\nefforts at coaching lacrosse.<br />\nPresent varsity coach Bob Scott,<br />\na former player under Morrill and<br />\n<br />\nLate Professor W. Kelso Morrill<br />\na great admirer of his, put it<br />\nsuccinctly: \"He lived for the<br />\ngame of lacrosse.\" And from his<br />\nathletes; as well as from his<br />\nstudents, he demanded<br />\nperfection.

All of<br />\nthem have done a real fine job<br />\nthus far in workouts and<br />\nscrimmages.\"<br />\nRutkowski, like Pedrazic and<br />\nGoldwine, is a local boy who<br />\nplayed fullback for two Maryland<br />\n<br />\nState Championship teams while<br />\nattending Dundalk High School,<br />\nand is probably the most talented<br />\nplayer on the team.<br />\nThough he originally decided<br />\nto come to Hopkins more for<br />\nacademic reasons than athletic,<br />\nJoe has., come to have a great<br />\nrespect for Coach Oliver and his<br />\nnew \"4-4-2 setup.\" As he told<br />\nthis reporter,<br />\n\"To be truthful. I thought his<br />\nplan would never work at first it's great for me, because it<br />\nstrengthens the defense, but the<br />\noffensive flow is greatly<br />\nweakened since there are only<br />\ntwo linemen.

After<br />\nthe first few minutes of the<br />\ngame, it was relatively obvious<br />\nthat Hopkins had lost their cool,<br />\nwith Claver Calvert Hall<br />\noutplaying the Blue Jays for the<br />\nremainder of the game.<br />\nThe Jays seemed to have it all<br />\ntogether until the Calvert Hall<br />\ngoalie blocked a head shot from<br />\nHopkins' Arguero.

As he<br />\ncommented,<br />\n\"I feel that Hopkins has even<br />\nmore talent this year than they<br />\nhad all of last season, and the<br />\nattitude is great. We're still not a<br />\nbig college power by any means,<br />\nbut we should do fairly well in<br />\nour conference.\"<br />\nSmart Passer<br />\nOther potential starters for the<br />\nJays this year are goalie Jack<br />\nButkowski and \"walk-ons'<br />\nlineman Bruce Cavenzas, who has<br />\nbeen a pleasant surprise to Coach<br />\nOliver, being both a good shooter<br />\nand a smart passer.<br />\nButkowski, expecting to play<br />\nonly junior varsity this year, has<br />\na very good chance of starting in<br />\nthe goal.

It was tough for him to<br />\nrelax when watching a game, he<br />\nwas so involved with the tension<br />\nof the moment.<br />\nMan of the Year<br />\nAfter he retired from<br />\ncoaching, he still could not keep<br />\naway from the game. His<br />\ntextbook and film on lacrosse<br />\nfundamentals earned him the<br />\n1953 U.S.I.L.A. Man-of-the-Year<br />\nAward. His own, son, W. Kelso,<br />\nJr., was one of his personal<br />\ncoaching projects, and he became<br />\none of Hopkins' greatest<br />\nattackman ever, a threethne<br />\nAll-American in 1957-58-59. And<br />\neven after he was no longer head<br />\ncoach, lie never hesitated to give<br />\npresent coach Scott a call after<br />\nevery game to offer comments<br />\nand advice on every aspect of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nThe climax of his lacrosse<br />\ncareer came in November 1962,<br />\nwhen he was elected into the<br />\nLacrosse Hall of Fame, where a<br />\nplaque in his name is now on<br />\ndisplay.<br />\nAll these anecdotes about Dr.<br />\nMorrill confirm over and over his<br />\nunflagging devotion to Hopkins,<br />\neven to his dying day. All who<br />\nknew him cited this as one pfs his<br />\noutstanding qualities. One<br />\nwell-known incident is worth<br />\nrepeating here. It was during his<br />\nlast years, when Morrill suffered<br />\nfrom ill health and was<br />\ncontinually told by his doctors to<br />\ncurtail his activities. One time in<br />\nlecturing and merely asked his<br />\nlisteners' pardon to rest for a<br />\nwhile. Whereupon he lay .down<br />\non the table for a few minutes,<br />\nthen got right back up and<br />\ncontinued teaching. Not so<br />\nsurprising, f;.-; it was what he did<br />\nthe best.<br />\n<br />\n\fseptember,15, 1972/news-letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nHopkins thinclad coach is<br />\nnative son made good<br />\nBy ROBERT FREUNDLICH<br />\nTrack and field is one of the<br />\nfew sports at Hopkins in which<br />\nthe average athlete can engage in<br />\nintercollegiate competition. This<br />\nis largely due to the dedicated<br />\nefforts of the track and cross<br />\ncountry coach, Don Masken.<br />\nCoach Masken is one of the<br />\npart-time coaches at Hopkins,<br />\ncoaching track and cross country<br />\nafter his regular job of teaching<br />\nmathematics at a Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nDon Masken<br />\njunior high school. Coach Masken<br />\nwas offered the job of coaching<br />\nat that junior high school but<br />\nsaid, \"I want to be where the<br />\ntalent is,\" so he took a job here.<br />\nHe arrived at Hopkins about six<br />\nyears ago after being chairman of<br />\nthe track and field divid ion of<br />\nthe Maryland A.A.U. He is also a<br />\nformer track star at Baltimore<br />\nCity College and Towson State.<br />\n<br />\nOn the personal side of Coach<br />\nMasken's life he likes \"to goof<br />\noff;\" for example, last week he<br />\nwatched the Olympics for<br />\nrelaxation. Besides track and<br />\nfield events his favorite was<br />\nswimming.<br />\nPhilosophy<br />\nIt is Coach Masken's track<br />\nphilosophy which really makes<br />\nthe team worthwhile. His main<br />\nobjective is to improve<br />\neveryone's ability, regardless of<br />\nwhether they win or not. To<br />\nquote coach Masken,\"If a person<br />\nruns a 4:29 mile while his best<br />\nprevious time is 4:30, I'm very<br />\nhappy even if he loses.\" Because<br />\nof this philosophy coach Masken<br />\nnever cuts anyone from his team,<br />\nand everyone competes in the<br />\ndual meets. However, because of<br />\nspace limitations in the tri-school<br />\nmeets, not everyone can compete<br />\nin these. Because everyone<br />\ncompetes whenever possible, the<br />\nsecond and third string track<br />\nteam members feel part of the<br />\nteam and not as outsiders. Even<br />\nthough coach Masken does not<br />\nask people to join the team, team<br />\nmorale is so high that team<br />\nmembers will seek out high<br />\nschool record holders and try to<br />\npersuade them to come out for<br />\nthe team. In fact, last year a team<br />\nmember sought and recruited a<br />\npersou who later acquired his<br />\nposition on the team. At<br />\nHopkins, where competition and<br />\n\"throating\" is the rule, it is rare<br />\nto see a person put the good of a<br />\n<br />\nteam above individual desire. A<br />\ncoach that can instill this in his<br />\nteam has done more for them<br />\nthen anyone else at Hopkins.<br />\nThat Masken coaches only for<br />\nenjoyment and not for a living<br />\nexplains why he is one of the few<br />\npeople at Hopkins who is<br />\ninterested in developing the<br />\nindividual.<br />\nHopkins athletic staff prepares fbr season.<br />\n<br />\nsports briefs, e C..<br />\nTRAINERS NEEDED<br />\nadvantages for students (male or<br />\nSo you aren't athletically female) to become managers.<br />\ninclined or just not good enough They travel with the teams to<br />\nto make the team!

Today they are<br />\n,<br />\n4070.) Although a decrease in<br />\nmuds may result, he expects the<br />\nEvening College to remain<br />\nsolvent.<br /><br />\ndesires assistance. To facilitate<br />\nthis, Brown said, no staff<br />\nmembers are authorized \u2022 or<br />\ninterested - in publicizing of<br />\nreporting and operation or<br />\nconsultation to parents, friends,<br />\nor other officials. This does not<br />\ninclude yielding general<br />\ninformation, upon request, such<br />\nas whether or not someone is in<br />\nfact in the hospital or infirmary,<br />\nthe person's condition, and any<br />\nother public information.<br />\nConsistently stressed<br />\nthroughout was the assured<br />\nprivacy of personal matters, the<br />\ncomplete availability of any or all<br />\nhealth services to students, as<br />\nwell as the desire on the part of<br />\nthe staff to help. Burnett,<br />\nspeaking for the entire Medical<br />\nServices, closed on a sincere<br />\nnote: \"We are really terribly<br />\nanxious to meet your needs.\"<br /><br />\nexpand programs have been<br />\nhampered by an inability to<br />\nattract qualified faculty. Even<br />\nthough the College's budget<br />\n_isstrained, the expansion of the<br />\nfaculty could be financed by<br />\ngrants from foundations and<br />\nvarious governmental agencies,<br />\nsaid Verhaalen.<br />\nNine for One<br />\nIn addition to its full time<br />\nfaculty, the night school has 334<br />\npart-time members. 40% come<br />\nfrom the Hopkins, 38% from<br />\ncommunity colleges and the rest<br />\nfrom other educational and<br />\nresearch institutions, principally<br />\nfrom the Baltimore-Wahington<br />\narea.<br />\nThe Dean also revealed plans<br />\nfor 8 or 9 minicourses to be<br />\noffered during the fall semester.<br />\nAccording to Verhaalen, these<br />\ncourses are for one credit only.<br />\nRest<br />\nOf faculty from the Hopkins,<br />\nless than 2% are junior<br />\ninstructors and graduate<br />\nstudents. The rest are assistant,<br />\nassociate, and full professors and<br />\nadministrative officials. These<br />\ninclude Vice-President Benton<br />\nand Dean Verhaalen.<br /><br />\non June 30 and there have been<br />\npromises made by both major<br />\npolitical party candidates<br />\nsupporting a volunteer army. The<br />\nROTC program however which<br />\nhad previously been in danger of<br />\narmy cancellation due to the<br />\ncontinuing decrease in<br />\nenrollment will benefit from the,<br />\ngeneral cutback in military<br />\npersonnel.<br />\nOne sophomore whose<br />\neligibility starts next January said<br />\nhe was joining ROTC strictly as a<br />\nsafety measure.<br />\nColonel Eleazor Parmly noted<br />\n\"Most of the people who joined<br />\nlast January have stayed in.\"<br />\nThey are still eligible for the<br />\ndraft until the end of this year.<br />\nParmly mentioned that whether<br />\nor not hey stay in the program<br />\nafter their year of eligibility is up<br />\nwill be indicative of trend under<br />\nthe lottery system.<br />\nThe decrease in ROTC<br />\nenrollment in the last few years<br />\nwill not have a destructive effect<br /><br />\nColonel Parmly<br />\non the Flopkins program,<br />\naccording to Parmly. \"The<br />\nmeasure of a viable program is<br />\nhow many commissions awarded,<br />\n\" said Parmly. The official army<br />\npolicy requires an average of 25<br />\nmen a year for five years. But<br />\naccording to Parmly they have<br />\nsaid they will accept 15 a year.<br />\nAlthough this year's senior class<br />\nhas only 10 cadets last year's<br />\nclass numbered 19 and the year<br />\nbefore was 28. \"We've been<br /><br />\ndoing more than necessary,\"<br />\nParmly declared.<br />\nParmly .observed the fact that<br />\nonly 30% of ROTC cadets had<br />\nbeen awarded commissions last<br />\nyear. The other 70% were<br />\nassigned to the reserves or to the<br />\nNational Guard. The general<br />\ndecrease in the number of<br />\nmilitary personnel was given as<br />\nthe reason for. the lack of<br />\npositions for the ROTC<br />\ngraduates. \"The army is getting'<br />\nsmaller,\" Parmly commented.<br />\nIf a volunteer army is initiated<br />\nthe ROTC program will probably<br />\ncontinue. Parmly presented the<br />\nscholarship program as a major<br />\nincentive for recruitment. In<br />\naddition he speculated there will<br />\nbe those who are interested in<br />\nentering military service through<br />\nthe ROTC program. \"From now<br />\non the guys in the ROTC<br />\nprogram will be in because they<br />\nwant to be in. The way it is now<br />\nwe can expect a 50% drop-uut<br />\nrate,\" said Parmly.<br /><br />\nLack of funds hinders Union<br />\nBy ALVIN STEIN<br />\nLack of funds from the<br />\nDepartment of Housing and<br />\nUrban Development . and the<br />\nabsence of-architectural plans are<br />\nhindering the construction of the<br />\nnew student union.<br />\nAccording to Director of the<br />\nHopkins Union, Jim Sydnor,<br />\n\"The construction of the union<br />\nwill be held up until we receive<br />\ncomplete drawings from the<br />\narchitect.\" The plans for the<br />\nunion were to be completed by<br />\nSeptember 11, but they have not<br />\nyet been submitted.

The very<br />\nfact that the Council is reviewing the<br />\nHonor Code Constitution has evoked a<br />\nreaction of surprise from most factions of<br />\nthe University. In the past, the Student<br />\nCouncil has provided a rubber stamp of<br />\napproval for the Honor Code,accepting it<br />\nas it was presented by the Commission.<br />\nThis year's presentation promises to be<br />\nslightly different.<br />\nThe problem is that the Honor Code is<br />\nnot working at Johns Hopkins. This is not<br />\nnews to anyone. Cheating has long been a<br />\nway of life at Johns Hopkins. Current<br />\nestimates are that 50% of the<br />\nUndergraduate student body cheats<br />\nregularly on exams and papers. By<br />\ncheating, I am not referring to<br />\nconsultation on take home exams. I am<br />\nreferring to plagiarism in the form of<br />\ncopying answers during exams, passing<br />\ntests back and forth and coming into<br />\nexams with \"prepared\" exam booklets.<br />\nLast semester I was qi an exam when a<br />\ntorrectecl<br />\nLiaatit_<br />\nby<br />\nthe<br />\n,,tessor anu men<br />\nthc. rtNr\u2018t,<br />\n1s.<br /><br />\neference material for his not yet finished<br />\nfiends.<br />\nBet'ore I continue, a brief explanation<br />\n)f how the Honor Commission is<br />\n;upposed to work is in order. The<br />\n2ommission is a self .perpetuating group<br />\n.)1. twenty-two students. When an Honor<br />\nviolation is spotted by either a student or<br />\nFaculty member, the Commission is given<br />\nthat student's name (the cheater) and the<br />\ncircumstances involved. It' the<br />\nCommission decides that there is enough<br />\nevidence to suspect the strident of<br />\ncheating then he is brought to trial. If<br />\nfound guilty, the punishment varies but<br />\nthe Commission does have the power to<br />\nexpel( a student. It is interesting to note<br />\nthat throughout the entire trial the<br />\naccused student never sees or for that<br />\nmatter knows who he is being accused<br />\nby. Actually, the processes of the<br />\nHonor CoMmission are fairly simple, but<br />\nthe Commission is faced with year after<br />\nyear of inactivity and it isn't due to a lack<br />\n-of cheating.<br />\nThe Honor Code isn't working for<br />\nmany reason. The main reason is that the<br />\nstudents aren't responding to their duties<br />\nunder the Code. In order for the Honor<br />\nCode to work,students must be willing to<br />\nturn in their fellow students when they<br />\nfind them cheating.<br />\nAdmittedly this is not a pleasant or<br />\nany easy task. I myself have seen<br />\nhundreds of students cheating and have<br />\nyet to turn anybody in to the Honor<br /><br />\nCommission. It's pretty difficult to turn<br />\nsomeone in you don't know,and what do<br />\nyou do when a friend is seen cheating?<br />\nAs I see it, the students at Hopkins are<br />\nfaced with a dilemma. They must choose<br />\nbetween two unhealthy situations: Either<br />\nthey begin to turn their fellow students in<br />\nto the Honor Commission for violations,<br />\nor the Code will be terminated and we<br />\nreturn to the proctored exam system and<br />\nother atrocities.<br />\nIf the Honor Code is dissolved, then<br />\nthe following things will happen: The<br />\nfirst is that Professors will gradually<br />\nreturn to the proctored exam. For those<br />\nof you who have never been in a<br />\nproctored exam, let me assure you that it<br />\nis unpleasant. The next thing that will<br />\nhappen (and in my opinion this is much<br />\nmore important) is that if a professor<br />\naccuses a student of cheating, the student<br />\nhas no recourse whatsoever. He cannot<br />\nappeal the decision. If the Professor<br />\nwants to flunk him out of the course,<br />\nthen he flunks and thats that. In short,<br />\nthe Honor Code offers the student<br />\nprotection and prevents an arbitrary<br /><br />\nHonor at Hopkins. I would much rather<br />\ngo back to proctored exams then<br />\ncontinue fooling ourselves that we have<br />\nan Honor Code at Hopkins.<br />\nI don't like the idea of students<br />\nreporting their fellow students for Honor<br />\nCode violations but I feel it must be<br />\ndone. Unfortunately it may be too late<br />\nfor even this to occur.<br />\nThe issue is now in that hands of what<br />\nI consider to be a very responsible<br />\nStudent Council. If they decide to vote<br />\ndown the revised Honor Code<br />\nConstitution and then call the old one up<br />\nfor revision and decide against that one as<br />\nwell, then its all over. The Honor<br />\nCommission ceases to function as of that<br />\nvote.<br />\nMy advice to the Student Council is to<br />\ngive the Honor Code one more chance to<br />\nwork. If they accept the revisions, then<br />\nit's up to the Honor Commission to get<br />\nthe students and the faculty to make it<br />\nwork. Personally, I think that this is a<br />\npossibility. Honor codes are working at<br />\nother Universities, although most face the<br />\nsame problem as Hopkins.<br />\nC<br /><br />\nV 1 IA<br /><br />\nla...<br /><br />\nII 1<br /><br />\nVSS<br /><br />\nN.VikA.N.<br /><br />\nthat the<br />\nstudents want to keep the Honor Code. I<br />\nknow the faculty wants to keep the<br />\nHonor Code, yet neither of these two<br />\ngroups are willing to make the Code<br />\nwork. I have yet to have a Professor<br />\nmention the existence of the Code.<br />\nStudents refuse to turn in other students;<br />\nand up until now, no one \u2022 even wants to<br />\ndiscuss the issue.<br />\nI feel that abolishing the Honor Code<br />\nwould be a giant step backwards at<br />\nHopkins. I also believe that we cannot<br />\ncontinue to operate under the sham of<br />\non the snot polls, I am convinced<br /><br />\n1 II<br /><br />\ns<br /><br />\nthen 1 can almost guarantee this will he<br />\nthe last year for the Honor Code at Johns<br />\nHopkins. Hopkins without an Honor<br />\nCode will be a much changed Hopkins,<br />\nand it will be a sad thing to see.<br />\nRight now it's up to the Student<br />\nCouncil, and it will be interesting to see<br />\nwhat they decide to do. I hope they<br />\naccept the new Constitution and give the<br />\nCode one more try.<br />\nOpinion is everybody's voice in the<br />\nNews-Letter. Send typewritten copy to<br />\nbox 1230.

In ancient Greece, athletes<br />\nwere guaranteed safe passage to and from<br />\nthe Games, but wars between competing<br />\nstates were not halted for the<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThis hypocrisy has, if anything, grown<br /><br />\nBy ROBERT RUBY<br />\nThe most important thing for me<br />\nabout the music of John McLaughlin is<br />\nthat I enjoy it. More knowledgeable<br />\npeople are able to talk about the<br />\ntechnical virtuosity and the<br />\ninnovativeness (two qualities which are<br />\nnot easy to separate)which is heard from<br />\nhis records, but I think this is the way<br />\nthat these people say that they, too,<br />\nenjoy his music.<br />\nMcLaughlin's most recent record,\"The<br />\nInner Mounting Flame,\" is his first that<br />\nhas been widely distributed. It features<br />\nthe Mahavishnu Orchestra, which is<br />\ncomposed of Billy Cobham on drums,<br />\nRick Laird on bass, pianist Jan Hammer,<br />\nJerry Goodman with what I think is<br />\nsometimes an electric violin, and John<br />\nMcLaughlin himself with acoustic and<br />\nelectric guitars. \"Mahavishnu\" is the<br />\nname that McLaughlin has now taken for<br />\nhimself, and this is a result of his<br />\nmeditational experiences with Sri<br />\nChinmoy.<br />\nAll the members of the orchestra live<br /><br />\nt\u2014<br /><br />\n4.1.1,11 b<br /><br />\nAs well he might, Steven Muller was grimacing<br />\nyesterday as he received congratulations on his<br />\nappointment as the next President of the Hopkins<br />\nHospital. For on October 1st, he will become<br />\nresponsible for the direction of the hospital in addition<br />\nto the University he already heads. He will be unable<br />\nto duck controversies between the medical school and<br />\nthe hospital by saying, \"Talk to the hospital people,\"<br />\nbut will instead have to meditate the controversies<br />\nhimself. If he can do the job successfully, his<br />\nappointment will bring new unity to the somewhat<br />\ndichotomous Hopkins Institutions.<br />\nThe new hospital president inherits a myriad of<br />\nproblems ranging from decaying buildings to hostility<br />\nin the East Baltimore neighborhood. With his new<br />\npower, Muller can do much to alleviate these problems<br />\nbecause he will be in charge of all of Hopkins, not just<br />\nthe University. It is true that both the medical schools<br />\nand the hospital are expanding, with the establishment<br />\nof an Allied Health School and the East Baltimore and<br />\nColumbia Medical Plans. His dual role will allow him<br />\nto lead the whole East Baltimore complex in the<br />\nimprovement of medical research and care. He will<br />\nhopefully now lead the University and the hospital in<br />\nthe direction of service not only to itself but also to<br />\nthe community at large.<br /><br />\nthoughts of calculus or chemistry or<br />\nphysics or whatever pre-med course one is<br />\ntaking at the moment.<br />\nAnd then there was the freshman who<br />\nshyly asked an upperclassman if it was<br />\npossible to take freshman chem, calculus<br />\nand physics in first semester freshman<br />\nyear. Naturally the upperclassman replied<br />\nthat that was impossible. But he couldn't<br />\ntell the kid he'd be crazy to try, because<br />\nthose absurd dreams are great as long as<br />\nthey last.<br />\nWatching a freshman class enter is<br />\ntouching in a way because they still<br />\nremember the elation of getting that<br />\nacceptance letter and they're still<br /><br />\nhopeful. They're smart enough to be<br />\nworried, but innocent enough to be<br />\nidealistic and far different than the<br />\ncynical, bitter upperclassmen they will<br />\nbecome.<br />\nBut they will become embittered soon<br />\nenough, which is too bad because the<br />\ndedication and promise they once had<br />\nwould have been useful had they lasted.<br />\nThe 341 natural science majors, who are<br />\nmostly pre-meds, will dwindle down to<br />\nmaybe 75 actual applicants to medical<br />\nschool, leaving a lot of very unhappy,<br />\ndisappointed graduates, who never even<br />\ngot to apply. Their absurd dreams will<br />\nhave faded and they will start to look for<br /><br />\na non-existent job teaching school or give<br />\nup and spend a year in Europe and try<br />\nagain later.<br />\nDreams are nice for a while, but they<br />\ndon't do everything a person needs done<br />\nfor him; they don't last forever and they<br />\ncan't alter what is essentially true.<br />\nEducation could be a little less grim<br />\nhere if the pre-med ambience were<br />\nreduced; that would leave far fewer<br />\npeople to become caustic and cynical.<br />\nabout what is supposed to be one of<br />\nAmerica's great universities. For years,<br />\nstudents here have had nothing but their<br />\ndreams and that is not enough.<br /><br />\n* * *<br /><br />\nthe problem appears insoluble<br /><br />\nmore visible in the modern Olympic<br />\nGaines.

The<br />\nOlympics have long provided second and<br />\nthird rate powers with the opportunity of<br />\nlashing out at the superpowers.<br />\nThe last Olympiad witnessed a<br />\nreformist Czechoslavakia scoring a moral<br />\nand political victory over its U.S.S.R.<br />\noppressors, through a hockey victory, and<br /><br />\nOlympic Games have always managed to<br />\nsurvive.

Kelso Morrill, a man for all seasons<br />\nBy NILS BRUBAKER<br />\nTwo great traditions at<br />\nHopkins are lacrosse and<br />\nscholastics, and one man who<br />\nexemplified excellence in both:<br />\nwas W. Kelso Morrill, Sr. Morrill;<br />\ndevoted his entire adult life to<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nArriving at the university fresh<br />\nout of City College in 1921, he<br />\nnever left up until the day he<br />\ndied in 1968. He received his B.A.<br />\n('29), all at Hopkins. As a<br />\ngraduate student he acted as a<br />\nteaching assistant in<br />\nmathematics, as well as playing<br />\nfor two national champion<br />\nlacrosse teams. He became coach<br />\nfor the team in 1931 and served<br />\nuntil 1951, during which time<br />\nHopkins won or tied for five<br />\nnational championships. He was<br />\nnamed Associate Professor of<br />\nMathematics in 1950, Director of<br />\nStudent Activities in 1951, and<br />\nbecame the first Dean of<br />\nStudents at JHU in 1959.<br />\nFor Dr. Morrill these offices<br />\nwere more than just a list of<br />\ntitles. Dean Shaffer, probably his<br />\nclosest friend at Hopkins,<br />\nremembered him \" primarily for<br />\nhis interest in people. \" He<br />\ndisplayed this interest with every<br />\nstudent he dealt with. His office<br />\nin the White House was always<br />\nopen to any student, for any<br />\nreason. His former secretary, Mrs.<br />\nGerrie UPoint, recalls that at<br />\nlunchtime each day Dr. Morrill<br /><br />\nwould eat in his office, correcting<br />\nthe mistakes of three or four<br />\nstudents doing problems on the<br />\nchalkboards lining the walls of<br />\nthe room. His policy was never<br />\nflunk a student who came<br />\npersonally to him for help, and<br />\nhe always gave his students the<br />\nbenefit of the doubt on<br />\nborderline grades.<br />\nAdministrator<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAs an administrator he did his<br />\nbest to help the students. He<br />\ndevised a new freshman advising<br />\nprogram, and met frequently<br />\nwith faculty advisors to iron out<br />\nproblems. A member of Kappa<br />\nAlpha Order, he was strongly in<br />\nfavor of fraternities at Hopkins,<br />\nand as their administrative liaison<br />\nwith the school and community,<br />\nconstantly strove to upgrade<br />\nfraternity life. Sometimes such<br />\nduties took him to the Baltimore<br />\nCity Jail to bail out some poor<br />\nmisguided I loppie suffering from<br />\nthe after-effects of weekend<br />\nrevelry.<br />\nStudents readily appreciated<br />\nhis concern for their welfare.<br />\nLong-departed alumni always<br />\nremembered Morrill and many<br />\nwrote him letters. One Christmas<br />\nlate in his life, when he was laid<br />\nup in the hospital, the university<br />\nGlee Club dropped by his room<br />\nto sing carols. Ile was so moved<br />\nby their display of appreciation<br />\nand care for him, he later<br />\nadmitted to his secretary,<br /><br />\nsomewhat embarrassed, that he<br />\nhad cried.<br />\nPerfect<br />\nHis style of teaching also<br />\ndeserved his students'<br />\nappreciation. He taught calculus<br />\nwith fervor and energy. His tall<br />\nstature, booming voice, and feel<br />\nfor personal contact compelled<br />\nevery student to actively learn<br />\nthe material. When a confused<br />\nstudent was not sure how to do 'a<br />\nproblem, Dr. Morrill would<br />\ncarefully watch him diagram it<br />\non the board. If he made a<br />\nmistake, Morrill would bellow,<br />\n\"What are you doing?!\" After<br />\npointing out the mistake, and<br />\nafter the student had sone the<br />\nproblem correctly, Morrill would<br />\nlight up, lift his arms into the air<br />\nand respond, \"Perfect.<br />\nPERFECT! What's your<br />\nproblem? You've got it!\" Many<br />\nstudents perhaps were<br />\nintimidated by his energetic<br />\nmanner, though it always<br />\nsurprised Dr. Morrill when he<br />\nheard about it. Nonetheless, few<br />\nstudents ever left him with only a<br />\nvague understanding of what<br />\nthey were doing. Dr. Morrill<br />\nwould not let them.<br />\nJudas Priest<br />\nIf he was passionate in his<br />\nefforts at teaching, Kelso Morrill<br />\nwas even more passionate in his<br />\nefforts at coaching lacrosse.<br />\nPresent varsity coach Bob Scott,<br />\na former player under Morrill and<br /><br />\nLate Professor W. Kelso Morrill<br />\na great admirer of his, put it<br />\nsuccinctly: \"He lived for the<br />\ngame of lacrosse.\" And from his<br />\nathletes; as well as from his<br />\nstudents, he demanded<br />\nperfection.

All of<br />\nthem have done a real fine job<br />\nthus far in workouts and<br />\nscrimmages.\"<br />\nRutkowski, like Pedrazic and<br />\nGoldwine, is a local boy who<br />\nplayed fullback for two Maryland<br /><br />\nState Championship teams while<br />\nattending Dundalk High School,<br />\nand is probably the most talented<br />\nplayer on the team.<br />\nThough he originally decided<br />\nto come to Hopkins more for<br />\nacademic reasons than athletic,<br />\nJoe has., come to have a great<br />\nrespect for Coach Oliver and his<br />\nnew \"4-4-2 setup.\" As he told<br />\nthis reporter,<br />\n\"To be truthful. I thought his<br />\nplan would never work at first it's great for me, because it<br />\nstrengthens the defense, but the<br />\noffensive flow is greatly<br />\nweakened since there are only<br />\ntwo linemen. But I think we can<br />\nimprove this situation as we<br />\nsciimmage more, though I'm not<br />\ngoing to make any predictions<br />\nabout the season.\"<br /><br />\nMwters struggle on Homewood field<br />\nLou Pedrazic comes from<br />\nOverlea High School, where he<br />\nplayed in the Maryland State<br />\nHigh School Championships his<br />\nsenior year, while John Goldwine<br /><br />\nJay booters lose scrimmage<br />\nLast Tuesday Calvert Hall High<br />\nSchool's soccer team came to<br />\nHomewood slightly uncertain as<br />\nto whether or not they would be<br />\nable to repeat their 1971 victory<br />\nover the Blue Jay varsity. After<br />\nthe first few minutes of the<br />\ngame, it was relatively obvious<br />\nthat Hopkins had lost their cool,<br />\nwith Claver Calvert Hall<br />\noutplaying the Blue Jays for the<br />\nremainder of the game.<br />\nThe Jays seemed to have it all<br />\ntogether until the Calvert Hall<br />\ngoalie blocked a head shot from<br />\nHopkins' Arguero.

As he<br />\ncommented,<br />\n\"I feel that Hopkins has even<br />\nmore talent this year than they<br />\nhad all of last season, and the<br />\nattitude is great. We're still not a<br />\nbig college power by any means,<br />\nbut we should do fairly well in<br />\nour conference.\"<br />\nSmart Passer<br />\nOther potential starters for the<br />\nJays this year are goalie Jack<br />\nButkowski and \"walk-ons'<br />\nlineman Bruce Cavenzas, who has<br />\nbeen a pleasant surprise to Coach<br />\nOliver, being both a good shooter<br />\nand a smart passer.<br />\nButkowski, expecting to play<br />\nonly junior varsity this year, has<br />\na very good chance of starting in<br />\nthe goal.

It was tough for him to<br />\nrelax when watching a game, he<br />\nwas so involved with the tension<br />\nof the moment.<br />\nMan of the Year<br />\nAfter he retired from<br />\ncoaching, he still could not keep<br />\naway from the game. His<br />\ntextbook and film on lacrosse<br />\nfundamentals earned him the<br />\n1953 U.S.I.L.A. Man-of-the-Year<br />\nAward. His own, son, W. Kelso,<br />\nJr., was one of his personal<br />\ncoaching projects, and he became<br />\none of Hopkins' greatest<br />\nattackman ever, a threethne<br />\nAll-American in 1957-58-59. And<br />\neven after he was no longer head<br />\ncoach, lie never hesitated to give<br />\npresent coach Scott a call after<br />\nevery game to offer comments<br />\nand advice on every aspect of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nThe climax of his lacrosse<br />\ncareer came in November 1962,<br />\nwhen he was elected into the<br />\nLacrosse Hall of Fame, where a<br />\nplaque in his name is now on<br />\ndisplay.<br />\nAll these anecdotes about Dr.<br />\nMorrill confirm over and over his<br />\nunflagging devotion to Hopkins,<br />\neven to his dying day. All who<br />\nknew him cited this as one pfs his<br />\noutstanding qualities. One<br />\nwell-known incident is worth<br />\nrepeating here. It was during his<br />\nlast years, when Morrill suffered<br />\nfrom ill health and was<br />\ncontinually told by his doctors to<br />\ncurtail his activities. One time in<br />\nlecturing and merely asked his<br />\nlisteners' pardon to rest for a<br />\nwhile. Whereupon he lay .down<br />\non the table for a few minutes,<br />\nthen got right back up and<br />\ncontinued teaching.

This<br />\nis largely due to the dedicated<br />\nefforts of the track and cross<br />\ncountry coach, Don Masken.<br />\nCoach Masken is one of the<br />\npart-time coaches at Hopkins,<br />\ncoaching track and cross country<br />\nafter his regular job of teaching<br />\nmathematics at a Baltimore<br /><br />\nDon Masken<br />\njunior high school. Coach Masken<br />\nwas offered the job of coaching<br />\nat that junior high school but<br />\nsaid, \"I want to be where the<br />\ntalent is,\" so he took a job here.<br />\nHe arrived at Hopkins about six<br />\nyears ago after being chairman of<br />\nthe track and field divid ion of<br />\nthe Maryland A.A.U. He is also a<br />\nformer track star at Baltimore<br />\nCity College and Towson State.<br /><br />\nOn the personal side of Coach<br />\nMasken's life he likes \"to goof<br />\noff;\" for example, last week he<br />\nwatched the Olympics for<br />\nrelaxation. Besides track and<br />\nfield events his favorite was<br />\nswimming.<br />\nPhilosophy<br />\nIt is Coach Masken's track<br />\nphilosophy which really makes<br />\nthe team worthwhile. His main<br />\nobjective is to improve<br />\neveryone's ability, regardless of<br />\nwhether they win or not. To<br />\nquote coach Masken,\"If a person<br />\nruns a 4:29 mile while his best<br />\nprevious time is 4:30, I'm very<br />\nhappy even if he loses.\" Because<br />\nof this philosophy coach Masken<br />\nnever cuts anyone from his team,<br />\nand everyone competes in the<br />\ndual meets. However, because of<br />\nspace limitations in the tri-school<br />\nmeets, not everyone can compete<br />\nin these. Because everyone<br />\ncompetes whenever possible, the<br />\nsecond and third string track<br />\nteam members feel part of the<br />\nteam and not as outsiders. Even<br />\nthough coach Masken does not<br />\nask people to join the team, team<br />\nmorale is so high that team<br />\nmembers will seek out high<br />\nschool record holders and try to<br />\npersuade them to come out for<br />\nthe team. In fact, last year a team<br />\nmember sought and recruited a<br />\npersou who later acquired his<br />\nposition on the team. At<br />\nHopkins, where competition and<br />\n\"throating\" is the rule, it is rare<br />\nto see a person put the good of a<br /><br />\nteam above individual desire. A<br />\ncoach that can instill this in his<br />\nteam has done more for them<br />\nthen anyone else at Hopkins.<br />\nThat Masken coaches only for<br />\nenjoyment and not for a living<br />\nexplains why he is one of the few<br />\npeople at Hopkins who is<br />\ninterested in developing the<br />\nindividual.<br />\nHopkins athletic staff prepares fbr season.<br /><br />\nsports briefs, e C..<br />\nTRAINERS NEEDED<br />\nadvantages for students (male or<br />\nSo you aren't athletically female) to become managers.<br />\ninclined or just not good enough They travel with the teams to<br />\nto make the team!
