At the same time, a number of travel<br />\nagencies on the west coast were fined a total of<br />\n14 million dollars by the Civil Aeronautics<br />\nBureau(CAB)for fraud.<br />\nEssentially, the problem stems from the<br />\nCAB restriction that group flight members must<br />\nbe dues-paying affiliates of a creditable \"affinity<br />\ngroup\" for at least 6 months. (An affinity group<br />\nis legally defined as an organization consisting<br />\nof fewer than 20,000 members with by-laws<br />\nand membership records and functioning not<br />\nsolely for the purpose of travel.) To circumvent<br />\nthis qualification, travel agencies have invested<br />\ninnocuous sounding organizations and post-dated<br />\nlate membership applications.<br />\nThe west coast is not alone, though.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Terry Easton, organizer of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Group flight plan(JHU is a legitimate \"affinity group\"), an organization called<br />\nthe National Vagabond- Sports Club, NVSC,<br />\noperating on numerous American university<br />\ncampuses, including Hopkins and Goucher, has<br />\nbeen involved in a number of illegal and unethical practices. The NVSC has no purpose outside<br />\nof travel and frequently post-dates membership<br />\napplications, Easton declared. It also assesses new<br />\nmembers a 10 dollar \"registration fee\", which is<br />\nstrictly forbidden by the International Association of Travel Agents(IATA)and which is pocked by the.NVSC agent. In addition it advertises<br />\nits flights to non-members (also contrary to<br />\nIATA rules) as well as withholding as much as<br />\n.25% of payments received when, for one reason<br />\nor another a scheduled flight is cancelled.<br />\nHarry Singleton, the NVSC representative<br />\nat Hopkins, denied all this completely, swearing<br />\nthat he could never \"be affiliated with any or-<br />\n<br />\nganization\" engaged in \"illegal practices\" contending that what Easton claims is \"bullshit\".<br />\nPursuing the matter a bit further, he accussed<br />\nEaston of pulling down his NVSC advertisemerits from bulletin boards.<br />\nActually, the problem is so widespread that<br />\nover \"one half of the international flights\" provided by the major airlines are illegal, according<br />\nto Easton. In addition to these regularly, scheduled flights, over 85% of overseas charter<br />\nflights are also illegitimate for the same violations. Over 500 of these were cancelled last<br />\nyear by the CAB and 125 have been stopped so<br />\nfar this year. So profuse is it that, Easton believes, group flights will not be offered at all next<br />\nyear.<br />\nInstead, it appears, the bulk fare, offered by<br />\nindividual airlines themselves, will replace \u2022the<br />\ngroup fare. Though more expensive, the bulk<br />\nfare plan will provide air and land transportation<br />\nand hotel accomodations all in one package deal.<br />\n<br />\nhe johns hopkins university<br />\nVo LXXIV, No. 24<br />\n<br />\ni441;\u2022:;tz<br />\n<br />\nTues say, March 3, 1970, Homewood, Baltimore<br />\n<br />\n74th Year<br />\n<br />\nSuspension Decision<br />\nDraws Protest From<br />\nAppeals Bd.

Mr. Bilgrave did not sit on<br />\nthe Appeals Board for the case.<br />\nCotter stated that the defendent's appeal of the suspension<br />\nwas based on \"personal and psychological reasons\". He said that<br />\nthe appeal was presented id a<br />\n\"very bad light\", and that the de-<br />\n<br />\nfendent's poor presentation could<br />\nbe attributed to nervousness or<br />\ndishonesty. Cotter said that it was<br />\nimpossible to know which was the<br />\ncase, and that the appeals board<br />\nshould have based its decision on<br />\nthe fact that only two books valued at $3.10 were taken.<br />\nCotter stated that \"there are<br />\nwell-worked<br />\nout sanctions betno<br />\nprobation<br />\nween<br />\nand suspension.\"<br />\nHe added that because this is so,<br />\n\"the most lenient sentence should<br />\nhave been given\".<br />\nNothing in Conflict<br />\nAccording to Dr. John White,<br />\nprofessor of Art History and Chairman of the Student Affairs Committee, there was nothing in the<br />\ncase which was in conflict with<br />\neither Dr. Gordon's proposed discipline code or the code proposed<br />\nby the SAC.<br />\nUnder the temporary, interim<br />\ndiscipline code, the SAC is serving<br />\nas the appeals board'as designated.<br />\nby Dean Kimball.<br />\nCotter noted that neither Dr.<br />\nGordon's proposed discipline code<br />\nnor the one advocated by the SAC<br />\ncontain intermediate sanctions between probation and suspension.<br />\nDr. White said that the defendent did not contest the facts<br />\nof the case but that he appealed<br />\nthe prescribed punishment.<br />\nThe decision of the appeals<br />\nboard, though not unanimous, was<br />\na clear-cut majority. Dr. White was<br />\ncareful to mention that there was<br />\nno student-faculty split on the<br />\nissue.<br />\nThe result of the two-hour<br />\nsession, which was closed at the<br />\ndiscretion of the defendent, was<br />\n<br />\nThe University Book Center has been plagued with financial difficulties not the<br />\nleast of which is theft.

My opposition to it is in the<br />\nminority,\" believes biology professor<br />\nPhilip Hartman.<br />\nBefore the passage, of the new law,<br />\ncollege men faced uncertainty about their<br />\ndraft eligibility. They did not know whether they would be drafted until after<br />\nthey completed their college education.<br />\nIf they were sure of being taken, many<br />\nwould have joined R.O.T.C. so they could<br />\nenter the army with a commission.<br />\nAs a result of the law, college men<br />\ngenerally know how they stand in relation to the draft before they must sign<br />\nan R.O.T.C. contract. According to Dr.<br />\nHartman, now \"students are forced into<br />\nR.O.T.C. not to be drafted.\" He notes<br />\nthat the number of applicants has risen,<br />\nmaking it impossible to phase out the<br />\nactivity.<br />\nEven so, he would like Hopkins to give<br />\nROTC . a lower priority than he believes<br />\nit now receives. He points out that while<br />\nofficially, this activity is extra-curricular, it continues to be listed as an<br />\nacademic department in the University<br />\n<br />\ncatalogue. He believes this listing gives<br />\nROTC undue importance, with respect<br />\nto its official University status.<br />\nHe bases his opposition to ROTC on<br />\nthe premise that \"it directly hinders the<br />\ntraining of scholars.\" Dr.Hartmanwants<br />\nthe scholarship money now offered by<br />\nthe army to be used for educational purposes. He believes \"it makes more sense<br />\nto support a sociology major,' who will<br />\ncontribute more to society than someone<br />\nwho goes into the army.<br />\nDr. Hartman contends that \"It's not<br />\nfair to oblige a high school senior to<br />\nsign a ROTC contract. At that age, other<br />\npossibilities may up. A significant percent may regret the decision. A Hopkins<br />\ngraduate who wants to serve can get a<br />\ncommission after graduation.\"<br />\n<br />\nTomorrow's Scholars<br />\nThe professor observes that following<br />\ngraduation, ROTC candidates are committed to six years in the army. He claims<br />\nthat it is \"unlikely that these men can<br />\ncompete with students uncommitted to<br />\nactive military service and become tomorrow's scholars.<br />\n<br />\n\"Universities are going to have to deckle whether they want to train people<br />\nfor the army or humanitarian purposes.\"<br />\nThe office of education could \"much better distribute the fellowships\" presently<br />\nallotted to R.O.T.C. scholarships.\"This<br />\nis all the taxpayer's money. It's not what<br />\nI want my tax money to go to.\"<br />\n- As a substitute for the current military<br />\nselection process, which creates a need<br />\nfor ROTC, Hartman said that he would<br />\nlike to see all deferments abolished<br />\n\"providing a man is susceptible to the<br />\ndraft for only one year between his senior<br />\nyear in high school and his first year is<br />\ncollege. To have a student continually<br />\nsusceptible is ridiculous.\" He adds that<br />\nan even better solution would be to cut<br />\nthe size of the military by four-fifths,<br />\nand make it a volunteer army.<br />\nHartman has long been involved in the<br />\ncontroversy surrounding the place of<br />\nROTC on campus. He was one of the<br />\nmost active of the propontents of the<br />\nremoval of academic credit from the<br />\nUniversity's ROTC courses.<br />\nHartman has also engaged in a running debate in the N-L Correspondence<br />\n<br />\ncolumn with Colonel Eleazaer Parmley<br />\nover the merits of ROTC on campus and<br />\nin general.

Of course,<br />\na student union will take years to build, and building cannot<br />\nstart without plans and funds to insure the success of the<br />\nconstruction project. In the interim, plans call for temporary facilities to be located in Shriver Hall.<br />\nThe idea to locate union facilities in Shriver until a<br />\ngenuine union can be built is a step in the right direction.<br />\nHowever, the plans, as they have been formulated, give cause.<br />\nfor concern. The Shriver Hall facility is being planned to<br />\naccommodate the needs of the Homewood campus as it<br />\n.presently exists. The ad hoc -committee is attempting to<br />\nplan for students with patterns of activity which fit the<br />\nHopkins campus now.<br />\nWhat they have not taken into account is the substantial change which the presence of a union will make on<br />\nthis campus. For example, the two bowling alleys which<br />\npresently serve the entire Hopkins community are often left<br />\nunused. As the campus presently functions, two bowling<br />\n-might be sufficient for all of the students. With a union,<br />\nhowever, students will expect and demand much more in<br />\nthe way of recreational facilities. The fact that there are<br />\nvirtually no facilities for this type of recreation and no room<br />\nin the athletic center for additional facilities has postponed<br />\nthis demand. One must not think, however, that the present<br />\nfacilities in another location, or only a slight increase in the<br />\npresent facilities,will suffice.<br />\nOnce there exists a place on campus where students<br />\nmay congregate, and know that they will find facilities for<br />\nrelaxation and recreation, there will be a tremendous increase in the number of students on campus.<br />\nAt many other schools, a new union soon becomes<br />\nobsolete because the planning did not take into account the<br />\nchange in expectations and behavior patterns which the<br />\nnew facilities caused. Hopkins can learn from the exper\u2022 iences of these other schools. A union for the Homewood<br />\ncampus cannot be built to accommodate its present needs.<br />\nThe needs of the campus, when it becomes a campus in the<br />\ntrue sense, will be qualitatively different from those of the<br />\npresent.<br />\n<br />\nHERE<br />\nFORMULA FoR<br />\nFAMOUS ORIENTAL-piSApPEARI N6.<br />\n<br />\nACT.<br />\n<br />\nField Enterprisea, 1ne., 1970<br />\n<br />\nBost,c1:<br />\n:<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n0n Grades<br />\nBy DAVID BOSTED<br />\nThe most important thing to Hopkins undergraduates, it sometimes seems, is \"grades.\"Infits of<br />\ndepression about the state of the University one is<br />\ninevitably struck by the conviction that the appearance of the result of the learning process--grading--takes precedence in the minds of most students here over the reality of the result--wisdom<br />\nor knowledge--or the learning process itself.<br />\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Hopkins grading system involves the socialization of<br />\nprofessors into the relatively \"easy\" grading system. Most professors seem highly self-conscious<br />\nabout the grades they give, and are easily convinced to grade on a B-curve. In some cases a<br />\nnoble motive underscores the general practice of<br />\neasy grading; professors who feel that education is<br />\nto be sought for its own sake often w ish to alleviate<br />\nthe grade-anxiety from which tier students suffer,<br />\nand seek to do so by giving A's and B's to one and<br />\nall.<br />\nThe median grade for freshmen has been rising<br />\nslowly for the past several years.It has risen from<br />\n2.48 (64/65) to 2.59 (65/66)to 2.57 (66/67)to 2.66<br />\n(67/68) to 2.71 (68/69). Some variation is no doubt<br />\ndue to variations in class size(classes have tended<br />\nto become ever larger, so that the total undergraduate population has grown nearly 30% in the past<br />\nfive years) and overall class intelligence. The<br />\nmedian grade for sophomoreshaS also risen slowly, from 2.49(64/65)to 2.52(65/66)to 2.56 (66/67)<br />\n2.58 (67/68) to 2.74 (68/69). The median grade<br />\nfor juniors has moved from 2.60(65/66) to 2.66<br />\n(66/67) to 2.83 (67/68) to 2.89(68/69). The median<br />\ngrade for seniors has advanced rapidly in recent<br />\nyears, from 2.74 (64/65) to 2.76 (65/66) to 2.80<br />\n(66/67) to 2.95 (67/68) to 3.07 (68/69). Thus,during the 68/69 school year, the median grade point<br />\nof the Class of '7Z was Z.71, of the Class of '73<br />\nwas 2.74, of the Class of '70 was 2.89, and of the<br />\nClass of '69 was 3.07.<br />\nThe B-/B school-wide average stands in sharp<br />\ncontrast to the actual level of intellectual thought<br />\nat Hopkins. It is my personal impression--N-L<br />\nreaders please verify or deny this--that the actual<br />\nlevel of undergraduate scholarship at Hopkins is<br />\nquite low. This impression is derived from rapping<br />\nwith several professors; a common complaint is<br />\nthat the buld of the workwhich passes before them<br />\nis at best \"mediocre.\" (This is not to say that<br />\nHopkins students are not conscientious about their<br />\nwork. In a mechanical way, most students seem<br />\nto be rather diligent.) My own impression is that<br />\nso little real \"thinking\" occurs on the undergraduate level at Hopkins that professors richly<br />\nreward any sign of perceptivity and intelligence<br />\nin an effort to encourage it.<br />\nIt should surprise no one that students who avail<br />\nthemselves of the pass-fail option have a higher<br />\nmedian grade-point, than those who do not. The<br />\npass-fail Option can be a powerful tool to enhance<br />\none's cumulative average by providing credit for a<br />\nminimum of work, thereby freeing time to pursue<br />\nhigher grades in other courses.<br />\nGrade fever infects everyone's life at Hopkins.<br />\nThe student who does not want his grades posted is<br />\na freak. More freakish still is the student who objects to the entire concept of posting grades. Receiving a \"C\" is an insult. Being given an \"F\"<br />\ninvolves a moral judgment.<br />\nThe vocabulary of grading at Hopkins is extensive, in proportion to the undergraduate interest<br />\nin the subject. There are \"aces\", \"bases,\"<br />\n\"hooks,\" \"dogs,\" and \"flags\"; students who study<br />\nare, among other things, \"throats\", \"ghouls\",<br />\nand \"grinds\". Everyone in competition with you<br />\n(and believe me, \"cooperative learning\" is a con-<br />\n<br />\ncept foreign to this University) is \"grade-grubbing.\"<br />\nThe mythology of grading at Hopkins includes<br />\na number of interesting types. The tragic figure<br />\nIs the student who is given an \"A\" in his passfail course; he receives sympathy and consolation. The men from D-level are said to be hybridtypes, acclimiated to hunching over their carreldesks is an atmosphere (this is.embarrassingly<br />\ninane) \"thick with study-juice.\" Comic relief is<br />\nprovided by the student who studies for an entire<br />\nsemester only to \"blow the final.\" In contrast<br />\nto the comic figure is the hero who gets a high<br />\ngrade with only minimum of effort, the student<br />\nwho \"lucks out\" in a course. The archetypal student who \"cheats his way through Hopkins\" is<br />\ngenuinely admired.<br />\nRelated to the subject of grading are the norms<br />\nwhich surround classroom behavior. Speaking out<br />\nin class is taboo. Also taboo is appearing to have<br />\na passionate interest in a subject; students are<br />\nexpected by the peers to maintain a \"cool\" and<br />\ndisinterested front. \"Cutting\"--a practice which<br />\nrecently seems to have become more prevalent-is all part of the game.<br />\nSeveral professors have commented on the fact<br />\nthat students rarely come to ask questions during<br />\noffice hours. Perhaps this is because the students<br />\nknow all the answers; more likely it is because<br />\nthe questions never occur to them. Also,students<br />\nare no doubt reluctant to risk becoming known as<br />\n\"brown-nosers\", \"ass-lickers\", and \"ass-wipers.\" Unenviable reputations!<br />\nHave you ever attended a lecture here? Everyone seems to write down everything (\"it might<br />\nbe on the exam\") and heads bob to the cadence of<br />\ntheindividual professor's sentence. If you ever<br />\n, want to blow your Goddamn mind, just go watch<br />\npeople desperately try to notes as Jackson Cope<br />\n,gives lectures on Shakespeare and James Joyce<br />\nthat are intellectual and theatrical experiences.<br />\nPerhaps paradoxically, despite the admiration<br />\ngranted students who \"pull out a course on the<br />\nfinal,\" a strong notion of \"justice\" operates among Hopkins undergraduates. Each student<br />\n\"ought to get what he deserves,\" and the empathy of the community extends to the student<br />\nwho gets \"screwed\" or \"flicked\" in a course.<br />\nDeserve? \"Use every man after his desert and<br />\nwho shall `scape whipping?\" Few here at Hopkins,<br />\nI should think.<br />\n<br />\nbefore the mast, aft the head<br />\n0, he's so ded<br />\nicated to that rag<br />\n(ragtag time lag)<br />\nthat several hundred<br />\ncouldn't match his,<br />\ndespike the lick<br />\nof infective<br />\ninvective<br />\nincentive.<br />\nhe was so spoke-softened<br />\n(riding on mirror rims)<br />\nhis bipsychs were andom-lee<br />\nrangular asquare the wills,<br />\nwho resoluted<br />\n(which revolved)<br />\nin a singular lack<br />\n(ah, the elixir)<br />\noffindable fact<br />\n(tractable<br />\nfictitious<br />\nfringes),<br />\nand whioch thus<br />\ncalumniated egregiopiately.<br />\nstephen tulloss<br />\n<br />\neTiN&..S!<br />\n)rou uus-rREEN DRAFTED.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMarch 3, 1970<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nfeatures\u2014.<br />\n'70 Novel: Beyond the'62 Chevy<br />\nBy ELLIOT KRIEGER<br />\nThere's this book that you have to read<br />\nand it's called Nog. It's by Rudolph Wurlitzer and it's a Pocket Books paperback--cheap and attractive. Whenever I<br />\nexplain it to someone, they are convinced not to read it. Grubby Al liked it, but<br />\nI didn't push it on him. So maybe I<br />\nShould stop right here. No, I'll take my<br />\nchances. Just remember; Nog is like the<br />\nmenthol cigar: it sounds terrible but it's<br />\nreally great.<br />\nThere's a blurb by Pynchononthe back<br />\nand that's a step in the right direction.<br />\n\"The Novel of Bullshit is dead...' he<br />\nwrites. I suppose by \"The Novel of Bullshit\" he means the novel which says<br />\nmore than it has to say to get you where<br />\nit's going. That's fair enough. It seems<br />\nthat all of the Major advances in fiction<br />\nsince, say, Dickens, have been in the<br />\nart of paring. Twentieth Century novels<br />\ntend more and more to eliminate fictional<br />\ndevices, explanations, interludes, background.<br />\nThe impact of modern psychology led<br />\ndirectly to a search for interior rather<br />\nthan<br />\nexterior motivation--stream of<br />\nconsciousness became an accepted technique. The influence of the film altered<br />\nour perception of time--the novel could<br />\nnot present jumps in locale without transitional paragraphs, filler. And then<br />\nthere's \"the pace of modern life\"--the<br />\nnovel must be FAST, to reflect the world<br />\naround it; and besides, who has time to<br />\nread a novel?<br />\n<br />\nUltimate Novel<br />\nEnough of these platitudes. Suffice it<br />\nto say that novels have been picking up<br />\nSpeed, with every advance, that which<br />\nhas been superseded becomes \"bullshit.\" The '62 Chevy looks fat, heavy,<br />\nslow; and they used to be proud of it!<br />\nIt's the same way with fiction.<br />\nWell, if this artichoke peeling is advancement and not just development,<br />\nNog is certainly the ultimate novel; and,<br />\nsince every novelist from now on will be<br />\nWurlitzer in one form or another, just<br />\nread Nog and then go to a lot of movies.<br />\nI can't imagine a novel more modern<br />\nthan Nog. (Of course, if I could I would<br />\nwrite it, and Wurlitzer would write the<br />\nblurb for my book etc.)<br />\nTo tell you a little about the book:<br />\n<br />\nSo. The narrator becomes an object,<br />\nand consequently objects come to life.<br />\nIn a supermarket; \"fields of waving coffee cans, rows of sweating lemons and<br />\nexpanding lettuce, shifting piles of bananas and candy bars and the food in my<br />\nown cart huddling together, as if for<br />\nwarmth, miniscule and afraid.\"<br />\n<br />\nIt's really a narator's novel, first person. The narrator (we can call him Nog<br />\nI guess) is the most debased narrator<br />\nyou've ever likely to find. He's entirely passive--does nothing save write this<br />\nbook. Past time is always catching up<br />\nwith present time--\"I am hungry and I<br />\nate\"--giving the impression of a near<br />\ncontinuous present tense, a tape-recorded outline of Nog's functions and acti-<br />\n<br />\nThe narrator's only feelings are fear,<br />\nhelplessness (\"I am helpless before a<br />\nplan\"), and gratefulness.(\"She made no<br />\nsound when she chewed. For that I am<br />\ngrateful.\"). Otherwise, he exists, he<br />\nwrites the book, he struggles to avoid<br />\nperspective.<br />\n<br />\nvities.<br />\n<br />\nUltimate Delineation<br />\nNog, however, does nothing. Everything is done to him. What makes the<br />\nbook so remarkable is the struggle<br />\nwhich Nog as human-being has to dehumanize himself. In that sense, Nog<br />\nis everything a novel should not be--it<br />\nis an attempt to place a fictional construction in absolute stasis. Nog speaks<br />\nto an immobilized hospital patient:<br />\nThere's nothing more to do. Everything has been built, everything said,<br />\neverything ruined. They even control the<br />\nweather. There's no place to go...You've<br />\ngot yourself a decent space. Seventyfive inches by thirty-five inches, give or<br />\ntake a few. You've got it made...\"<br />\nThat is Nog's goal, andNog's goal--ultimate delineation.<br />\nNog believes in a twisted Idealism -things exist only as perception, but imagined perception cannot be distinguished from sensory perception. He<br />\nlimits his memories to three things:<br />\n\"New York for adventure, beaches for<br />\nrelaxation, the octopus and Nog for speculation.\" You see, Nog is not the narrator's name. Nog is a remembered or<br />\nimagined person. Since the narrator has<br />\nno personality of his own, he adopts and<br />\nimprovises upon Nog when he must speak,<br />\nact, or ruminate. But when he does adopt<br />\nNog he is Nog, since he is nothing else.<br />\nMeanwhile, nothing happens. That's<br />\nnot quite true--lots of things happen.<br />\nThe events in Nog are of sufficient magnitude to make this a considerably longer<br />\nbook. But Nog is about the narrator's<br />\nperception, and there are times when he<br />\nsimply is not perceiving. Geographic.<br />\n<br />\nIt's altogether a horrifying book, but to<br />\nmy mind a most important one. It may<br />\noffer the final answer to the perplexities<br />\nand paradoxes of twentieth century life.<br />\nThere's no place left for romantic retreat; active involvement more often than<br />\nnot leads to catastrophe; and personal<br />\nintellectual elevation is meaningless in<br />\na world of pettiness and objects. Wurlitzer has had the courage to create a<br />\ncharacter who responds to his environment by mimicing it rather than ignoring it or fighting it. Nog is a genetic<br />\nmutant--destined to survive and, if Pynchon is right, reproduce. For that I am<br />\ngrateful.<br />\n<br />\nAttention All Stones Freaks:<br />\nLiver Than YOU'LL Ever Be<br />\nBy A. MICHAEL HILL<br />\nI'm sure that everyone has heard by<br />\nnow that there is an underground album<br />\nof the Stones' live concert out and that<br />\nit is recorded incredibly well considering its illegitimate origins, and that<br />\nif you didn't catch one of the concerts<br />\nyou could buy a copy of this album and<br />\nhave your own concert right in your room.<br />\nWell, \"That's not really true.\"<br />\nDon't get me wrong, this is a very good<br />\nalbum, but its the type of album you<br />\nshouldn't buy unless you know you're<br />\ngoing to like it before you hear it; in other<br />\nwords, for Stones Freaks only.<br />\nThere is a lot of energy released at<br />\nStones performances, witness Altamont,<br />\nbut only some of this goes into the music.<br />\nOne must remember that the entire arena<br />\nis packed with people who know that THE<br />\nROLLING STONES are about to be RIGHT<br />\nHERE, and as a result, they're about to<br />\nexplode. To give a good concert the Stones<br />\nhave to devote about half of their energy<br />\ninto being the Stones, playing their role<br />\nto the hilt, in order to release all this<br />\nenergy built up.<br />\n<br />\ntransitions are accomplished swiftly,<br />\nwithout description or presentation of<br />\nmotivation--\"I hitched to San Francisco.\" There are lists, and moments;<br />\nbut no connections.<br />\n<br />\nKeeping Up The Image<br />\nSo the Stones can't be expected to be as<br />\ntogether up on the stage as, say, Creedence Clearwater Revival; they have to<br />\n<br />\nplay their roles as well as their instruments, one must also keep in mind that<br />\nthis recording is of the Oakland Concert,<br />\none of the first. Reports have it that the<br />\nStones got better and better as the tour<br />\nwent on, thus this music is not as good<br />\nas that heard in Baltimore and New York.<br />\nSo, just because it's the Stones live and<br />\nyou've heard from a friend who went to a<br />\nconcert that it was great, don't expect<br />\nthis album to be great. A lot of ingredients go into a good Stones concert, and<br />\nthe music is only one.<br />\nJust to keep the image up, the album<br />\nopens with Jagger saying \"Shit,\" apparently over some equipment hassle. Then,<br />\nthey break into an old Chuck Berry song,<br />\n\"Carol.\" A friend of mine who is a dedicated Stones freak believes that if the<br />\nStones were completely free to play the<br />\nmusic they wanted, they would stick to<br />\nold rock 'n roll, and if the guitar playing<br />\nRichards does on this cut and on \"Little<br />\nQueenie\" on the other side is an indication, I'm inclined to agree with him. Very<br />\ntogether, though without the piano they<br />\nused in Baltimore.<br />\nJust to prove their fallibility, the<br />\nStones then proceed to blow \"Gimme<br />\nShelter.\" Rolling Stone's \"Best Cut of<br />\n1969\" just isn't the same without Nicky<br />\nHopkins and Mary Clayton. The Stones<br />\ndropped this song from the rest of their<br />\nconcerts.<br />\n<br />\nPotpourri Of Percussion<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nSHAME ON SOTI R<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn reading Alex Sotir's letter, I am<br />\nunable to believe that he himself considers what he wrote as factual. His<br />\naccusations and allegations to those at<br />\nwhom he personally directed his letter<br />\nare totally biased and flatly wrong.<br />\nOne can obviously see from the letter that it was directed to the Editor<br />\nof the sports section of the News-Letter, in response to the \"Jay's Nest\"<br />\narticle of Feb. 20th. His implication<br />\nseems to be that the Sports Editor, in<br />\nmaking a statement about a \"bush\" banquet, could only criticize and that the<br />\neditor was \"one who sits on the sidelines<br />\nof all the games of life criticizing and<br />\nunwilling to give of himself.\" This is the<br />\nmost irresponsible accusation toward<br />\nsomeone who has been so heavily involved in in so many activities that I have<br />\never come across. Mr. Sotir seems to<br />\ndirect his accusations at those people who<br />\nare the most involved. Perhaps his letter would have taken on at least some<br />\nrespectability if it had been directed at<br />\nour apathetic gtudent body rather than<br />\nat those who \"put out\" every day, in a<br />\n<br />\nnumber of areas.<br />\nIn \"thanking God\" for specific individuals on the campus, I fully agree that<br />\nthe Russ Passarellas and Paul Aliens<br />\nget involved and are willing to \"standup<br />\nand be counted.\" They are willing, as<br />\nis the News-Letter Sports Editor, George<br />\nKirschbaum, to get involved every day,in<br />\na number of areas, doing work which is<br />\nnot lauded or reported in the University<br />\n(such as the Student Council, the NewsLetter, Hullaballoo, BIA Secretary,<br />\nOrientation, etc. etc.) They break their<br />\nbacks behind the scenes and they work<br />\nIn thankless and unpublicized areas.<br />\nGranted, playing varsity athletics requires much time during a season and<br />\nthey, the athletes, must put out a great<br />\ndeal. However, far be it from me to believe that those athletes have put out,<br />\ngotten involved, and \"stood up and been<br />\ncounted in the arena of life,' as Mr.<br />\nSotir so eloquently puts it, to the extent<br />\nthat Mr. Kirschbaum has done so.<br />\nIn his \"Jay's Nest\" articles over the<br />\npast year, George Kirschbaum has consistently pushed to get more enthusiasm<br />\nfor Hopkins athletics, has \"stood up\"<br />\n<br />\nfor Hopkins athletics, and has taken initiative in trying to organize a tournament in Baltimore to complement our<br />\nathletic program. He has met with little<br />\nsupport from the Hopkins Athletic Center, that's for sure. Yet Mr. Sotir disregards all this and has the gall to accuse<br />\nthe Editor being of himself \"bush\" and<br />\ncriticizing without getting involved.<br />\nKirschbaum thought the athletics deserved a better deal at their banquet<br />\nthan they got, yet Sotir has successfully<br />\ntwisted that also. I think Alex Sotir has<br />\ndone a disservice to George Kirschbaum<br />\nin criticizing him when he has worked<br />\nso hard to try and develop some sembl`ance of spirit for Hopkins athletics.<br />\nAlthough a thank-you should bave been<br />\n\u2022the word coming out of the Athletic Office for all George Kirschbaum has done<br />\nIn pushing Hopkins athletics this past<br />\nschool year, Kirschbaum instead has<br />\nbeen criticized for doingsomethingworthwhile and beneficial to Hopkins.<br />\nI think an apology. by Sotir is definitely<br />\nIn order.<br />\n<br />\nN.<br />\n<br />\nGary St. Peter<br />\nClass of'72<br />\n<br />\nThe Stones admirably solved the problem of how to do \"Sympathy for the<br />\nDevil\" on stage by giving Taylor's guitar a large burden of the rhythm responsibilities. His hesitation beat riff, combined with Watts, Fat-back drum beat adequately take the place of the potpurri of<br />\npercussion on Beggar's Banquet. It was<br />\nmuch tighter in Baltimore, but here it<br />\nhas the togetherness of a good jam. This<br />\nis followed up by an oldie, \"I'm Free,\"<br />\nfeaturing a fine break by Mick Taylor, and<br />\na fine vocal by Jaggar. \"Live with Me\"<br />\ncloses out the side; it's fairly good,sticking pretty close to the record.<br />\nThe high point of the album is the<br />\nbeginning of side two; \"Love in Vain,\"<br />\nfeaturing Mick Taylor, is incredible,and<br />\nthat's all one can say. Almost as good is<br />\n\"Midnight Rambler\" which really gets<br />\ntogether after a slow beginning.

It featured<br />\na record breaking thirteen takedowns, in addition<br />\nto four pins and four decisions. The pins were<br />\nregistered by Captain Jack Hanemann (his third of<br />\nthe year), Bob Sanborn, Nick Pratt (his seventh<br />\nof the year), and Marshall Kapp (his first pin of<br />\nthe season).<br />\n<br />\nEfrrk6:,,,<br />\nHopkins fencers confer with judge before their latest match with<br />\nTemple U.

The<br />\nonly true loss was at 167, where Fred Ryland got<br />\nbeaten by C.U.'s Comereski.<br />\n<br />\nDespite the momentum of the team, the wrestlers lost to a very tough Swarthmore last Saturday by a score of 21-18. Actually, after the 190<br />\nlb. weight class, the score was tied 18-18,and it<br />\ntook a good match by their unlimited wrestler,<br />\nByers, to secure a victory. Highlights of the match<br />\nwere Turshen's fourth pin of the season, Hanemann's fourth also, Betta's decision at 142, Sanborn's draw with Lazzeri, and Jim McMenamin<br />\ndecision at 190 lbs.(wrestling for Pratt).<br />\nToday and tomorrow, the Mason-Dixon Championships are being held at Towson, followed by<br />\nthe MAC Championships the following week at<br />\nWilkes.

At the same time, a number of travel<br />\nagencies on the west coast were fined a total of<br />\n14 million dollars by the Civil Aeronautics<br />\nBureau(CAB)for fraud.<br />\nEssentially, the problem stems from the<br />\nCAB restriction that group flight members must<br />\nbe dues-paying affiliates of a creditable \"affinity<br />\ngroup\" for at least 6 months. (An affinity group<br />\nis legally defined as an organization consisting<br />\nof fewer than 20,000 members with by-laws<br />\nand membership records and functioning not<br />\nsolely for the purpose of travel.) To circumvent<br />\nthis qualification, travel agencies have invested<br />\ninnocuous sounding organizations and post-dated<br />\nlate membership applications.<br />\nThe west coast is not alone, though.<br /><br />\nAccording to Terry Easton, organizer of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Group flight plan(JHU is a legitimate \"affinity group\"), an organization called<br />\nthe National Vagabond- Sports Club, NVSC,<br />\noperating on numerous American university<br />\ncampuses, including Hopkins and Goucher, has<br />\nbeen involved in a number of illegal and unethical practices. The NVSC has no purpose outside<br />\nof travel and frequently post-dates membership<br />\napplications, Easton declared. It also assesses new<br />\nmembers a 10 dollar \"registration fee\", which is<br />\nstrictly forbidden by the International Association of Travel Agents(IATA)and which is pocked by the.NVSC agent. In addition it advertises<br />\nits flights to non-members (also contrary to<br />\nIATA rules) as well as withholding as much as<br />\n.25% of payments received when, for one reason<br />\nor another a scheduled flight is cancelled.<br />\nHarry Singleton, the NVSC representative<br />\nat Hopkins, denied all this completely, swearing<br />\nthat he could never \"be affiliated with any or-<br /><br />\nganization\" engaged in \"illegal practices\" contending that what Easton claims is \"bullshit\".<br />\nPursuing the matter a bit further, he accussed<br />\nEaston of pulling down his NVSC advertisemerits from bulletin boards.<br />\nActually, the problem is so widespread that<br />\nover \"one half of the international flights\" provided by the major airlines are illegal, according<br />\nto Easton. In addition to these regularly, scheduled flights, over 85% of overseas charter<br />\nflights are also illegitimate for the same violations. Over 500 of these were cancelled last<br />\nyear by the CAB and 125 have been stopped so<br />\nfar this year. So profuse is it that, Easton believes, group flights will not be offered at all next<br />\nyear.<br />\nInstead, it appears, the bulk fare, offered by<br />\nindividual airlines themselves, will replace \u2022the<br />\ngroup fare. Though more expensive, the bulk<br />\nfare plan will provide air and land transportation<br />\nand hotel accomodations all in one package deal.<br /><br />\nhe johns hopkins university<br />\nVo LXXIV, No. 24<br /><br />\ni441;\u2022:;tz<br /><br />\nTues say, March 3, 1970, Homewood, Baltimore<br /><br />\n74th Year<br /><br />\nSuspension Decision<br />\nDraws Protest From<br />\nAppeals Bd.

He said that<br />\nthe appeal was presented id a<br />\n\"very bad light\", and that the de-<br /><br />\nfendent's poor presentation could<br />\nbe attributed to nervousness or<br />\ndishonesty. Cotter said that it was<br />\nimpossible to know which was the<br />\ncase, and that the appeals board<br />\nshould have based its decision on<br />\nthe fact that only two books valued at $3.10 were taken.<br />\nCotter stated that \"there are<br />\nwell-worked<br />\nout sanctions betno<br />\nprobation<br />\nween<br />\nand suspension.\"<br />\nHe added that because this is so,<br />\n\"the most lenient sentence should<br />\nhave been given\".<br />\nNothing in Conflict<br />\nAccording to Dr. John White,<br />\nprofessor of Art History and Chairman of the Student Affairs Committee, there was nothing in the<br />\ncase which was in conflict with<br />\neither Dr. Gordon's proposed discipline code or the code proposed<br />\nby the SAC.<br />\nUnder the temporary, interim<br />\ndiscipline code, the SAC is serving<br />\nas the appeals board'as designated.<br />\nby Dean Kimball.<br />\nCotter noted that neither Dr.<br />\nGordon's proposed discipline code<br />\nnor the one advocated by the SAC<br />\ncontain intermediate sanctions between probation and suspension.<br />\nDr. White said that the defendent did not contest the facts<br />\nof the case but that he appealed<br />\nthe prescribed punishment.<br />\nThe decision of the appeals<br />\nboard, though not unanimous, was<br />\na clear-cut majority. Dr. White was<br />\ncareful to mention that there was<br />\nno student-faculty split on the<br />\nissue.<br />\nThe result of the two-hour<br />\nsession, which was closed at the<br />\ndiscretion of the defendent, was<br /><br />\nThe University Book Center has been plagued with financial difficulties not the<br />\nleast of which is theft. The Book Center is annually $20,000 to $25,000 in the red.<br />\ncalled \"a very wrong and bad decision\" by Cotter. \"The Committee worked in good faith,\" said<br />\nCotter, \"but they made a mistake.\"<br />\nCotter believed that \"the seriousness of the bookstore problem<br />\nobscured the seriousness of the individual's case.\" The book store<br />\nis losing money at the rate of<br />\n$20,000 to $25,000 a year due to<br />\nthievery.<br />\nJust Penalty<br />\nMr. Robert Bilgrave stated<br />\nthat he did not think that the penalty was too harsh. \"Had the student been tried under civil law,\"<br />\nsaid Bilgrave, \"he could have received a penalty of up to eighteen<br />\nmonths in jail and a fine of<br />\n$1,000.\" He mentioned that<br />\nothers caught removing books<br />\nfrom the bookstore had been less<br />\nharshly disciplined but that the<br />\nlevel of stealing did not decrease.<br />\nCotter also felt that another<br /><br />\nreason for the appeals board's decision was friction between the<br />\nadministration and the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee. \"Consciously<br />\nor unconsciously there may have<br />\nbeen a reluctance to overturn the<br />\nadministration a second time,\"<br />\nsaid Cotter. He was referring to<br />\nthe two-week extra-curricular activities suspension of three undergraduates for their Moratorium<br />\nDay activities on October 15.<br />\nName Withheld<br />\nDr. White has requested that<br />\nthe name of the suspended student<br />\nbe withheld since the student will<br />\nnow lose his 2-S draft deferrment<br />\nand so will now be eligible for the<br />\ndraft. Dr. White noted that the<br />\npossibility of the student's draft<br />\nboard learning of the suspension<br />\nwill be minimized in this way so<br />\nthe student will have less chance<br />\n\u2022 of being drafted in his semester<br />\nabsence from the University.<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nMarch 3;<br />\n) 1970<br /><br />\nHartman Says Draft Means ROTC Stays<br />\nBy PETER KATES<br />\nROTC is \"here to stay with the new<br />\ndraft law. My opposition to it is in the<br />\nminority,\" believes biology professor<br />\nPhilip Hartman.<br />\nBefore the passage, of the new law,<br />\ncollege men faced uncertainty about their<br />\ndraft eligibility. They did not know whether they would be drafted until after<br />\nthey completed their college education.<br />\nIf they were sure of being taken, many<br />\nwould have joined R.O.T.C. so they could<br />\nenter the army with a commission.<br />\nAs a result of the law, college men<br />\ngenerally know how they stand in relation to the draft before they must sign<br />\nan R.O.T.C. contract. According to Dr.<br />\nHartman, now \"students are forced into<br />\nR.O.T.C. not to be drafted.\" He notes<br />\nthat the number of applicants has risen,<br />\nmaking it impossible to phase out the<br />\nactivity.<br />\nEven so, he would like Hopkins to give<br />\nROTC . a lower priority than he believes<br />\nit now receives. He points out that while<br />\nofficially, this activity is extra-curricular, it continues to be listed as an<br />\nacademic department in the University<br /><br />\ncatalogue. He believes this listing gives<br />\nROTC undue importance, with respect<br />\nto its official University status.<br />\nHe bases his opposition to ROTC on<br />\nthe premise that \"it directly hinders the<br />\ntraining of scholars.\" Dr.Hartmanwants<br />\nthe scholarship money now offered by<br />\nthe army to be used for educational purposes. He believes \"it makes more sense<br />\nto support a sociology major,' who will<br />\ncontribute more to society than someone<br />\nwho goes into the army.<br />\nDr. Hartman contends that \"It's not<br />\nfair to oblige a high school senior to<br />\nsign a ROTC contract. At that age, other<br />\npossibilities may up. A significant percent may regret the decision. A Hopkins<br />\ngraduate who wants to serve can get a<br />\ncommission after graduation.\"<br /><br />\nTomorrow's Scholars<br />\nThe professor observes that following<br />\ngraduation, ROTC candidates are committed to six years in the army. He claims<br />\nthat it is \"unlikely that these men can<br />\ncompete with students uncommitted to<br />\nactive military service and become tomorrow's scholars.<br /><br />\n\"Universities are going to have to deckle whether they want to train people<br />\nfor the army or humanitarian purposes.\"<br />\nThe office of education could \"much better distribute the fellowships\" presently<br />\nallotted to R.O.T.C. scholarships.\"This<br />\nis all the taxpayer's money. It's not what<br />\nI want my tax money to go to.\"<br />\n- As a substitute for the current military<br />\nselection process, which creates a need<br />\nfor ROTC, Hartman said that he would<br />\nlike to see all deferments abolished<br />\n\"providing a man is susceptible to the<br />\ndraft for only one year between his senior<br />\nyear in high school and his first year is<br />\ncollege. To have a student continually<br />\nsusceptible is ridiculous.\" He adds that<br />\nan even better solution would be to cut<br />\nthe size of the military by four-fifths,<br />\nand make it a volunteer army.<br />\nHartman has long been involved in the<br />\ncontroversy surrounding the place of<br />\nROTC on campus. He was one of the<br />\nmost active of the propontents of the<br />\nremoval of academic credit from the<br />\nUniversity's ROTC courses.<br />\nHartman has also engaged in a running debate in the N-L Correspondence<br /><br />\ncolumn with Colonel Eleazaer Parmley<br />\nover the merits of ROTC on campus and<br />\nin general.

Cleary, who originally hoped<br />\nto get the signatures of fifty percent of<br />\nthe undergraduate student body, now has<br />\nlowered his sights. \"I'm not sure we'll<br />\nget twenty-five percent,\" he said.<br />\nCleary was amazed that despite two<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\ninserts, and consistent<br />\nNews-Letter coverage, many students<br />\nwere ignorant of the discipline controversy.

He indicated that he obtains<br />\nabout twenty signatures a night.<br /><br />\nMore Than Half<br />\nDr. John S.

However, Mann<br />\ndid not think that Gordon would reject<br />\nthe petition simply because it did not in- \u2022<br />\nelude supporting reasons. \"I feel that<br />\nthe petition states a good, clear opinion,\"<br />\nsaid Mann. \"I don't see how one can disregard this sentiment,\" he added.<br /><br />\nOpposing Petition<br />\nAnother faculty petition, supporting the<br />\nopposite position in the discipline code<br />\ncontroversy, is being circulated among<br />\nthe various departments. The petition,<br />\nwritten by Dr. Robert Gordon of the<br />\nSocial Relations department, supports<br />\nthe two most controversial points of<br />\nPresident Lincoln Gordon's proposed<br />\nconduct code, the composition of the Review Board and the retention of expulsion as a penalty.<br /><br />\nGordon<br />\nsaid that his petition was<br />\n\"slow -moving.\" He did not, however,<br />\nthink that apathy had hampered his campaign. \"I think apathy is an overworked explanation of non-response,\" he<br />\ncommented. He believed that many of<br />\nthe faculty members not signing either<br />\nhis or Dr. Mann's petition had very<br />\ngood reasons for not doing so.<br />\nAccording to Bob Cotter, President<br />\nof the Graduate Student Organization,<br />\nabout half of the GSO Council members<br />\nare personally circulating a petition<br />\nsupporting that SAC code.

However, delays in<br />\ngetting bids and awarding contracts forced a postponement of<br />\nsome of the work.<br />\nThe plans for improvements<br />\nwere drawn up at a meeting on<br />\nFebruary 19, 1969, attended by<br />\nRobert Bilgrave, Director of Student Affairs, and representatives<br />\nof the Student Council, the DSRC,<br />\nand the CISF.<br /><br />\nkins branch of Saga Food Service,<br />\nwhich operates the snack bar,said<br />\nthat new soda machines are<br />\nexpected within a week.

Of course,<br />\na student union will take years to build, and building cannot<br />\nstart without plans and funds to insure the success of the<br />\nconstruction project. In the interim, plans call for temporary facilities to be located in Shriver Hall.<br />\nThe idea to locate union facilities in Shriver until a<br />\ngenuine union can be built is a step in the right direction.<br />\nHowever, the plans, as they have been formulated, give cause.<br />\nfor concern. The Shriver Hall facility is being planned to<br />\naccommodate the needs of the Homewood campus as it<br />\n.presently exists. The ad hoc -committee is attempting to<br />\nplan for students with patterns of activity which fit the<br />\nHopkins campus now.<br />\nWhat they have not taken into account is the substantial change which the presence of a union will make on<br />\nthis campus. For example, the two bowling alleys which<br />\npresently serve the entire Hopkins community are often left<br />\nunused. As the campus presently functions, two bowling<br />\n-might be sufficient for all of the students. With a union,<br />\nhowever, students will expect and demand much more in<br />\nthe way of recreational facilities. The fact that there are<br />\nvirtually no facilities for this type of recreation and no room<br />\nin the athletic center for additional facilities has postponed<br />\nthis demand. One must not think, however, that the present<br />\nfacilities in another location, or only a slight increase in the<br />\npresent facilities,will suffice.<br />\nOnce there exists a place on campus where students<br />\nmay congregate, and know that they will find facilities for<br />\nrelaxation and recreation, there will be a tremendous increase in the number of students on campus.<br />\nAt many other schools, a new union soon becomes<br />\nobsolete because the planning did not take into account the<br />\nchange in expectations and behavior patterns which the<br />\nnew facilities caused. Hopkins can learn from the exper\u2022 iences of these other schools.

Most professors seem highly self-conscious<br />\nabout the grades they give, and are easily convinced to grade on a B-curve. In some cases a<br />\nnoble motive underscores the general practice of<br />\neasy grading; professors who feel that education is<br />\nto be sought for its own sake often w ish to alleviate<br />\nthe grade-anxiety from which tier students suffer,<br />\nand seek to do so by giving A's and B's to one and<br />\nall.<br />\nThe median grade for freshmen has been rising<br />\nslowly for the past several years.It has risen from<br />\n2.48 (64/65) to 2.59 (65/66)to 2.57 (66/67)to 2.66<br />\n(67/68) to 2.71 (68/69). Some variation is no doubt<br />\ndue to variations in class size(classes have tended<br />\nto become ever larger, so that the total undergraduate population has grown nearly 30% in the past<br />\nfive years) and overall class intelligence. The<br />\nmedian grade for sophomoreshaS also risen slowly, from 2.49(64/65)to 2.52(65/66)to 2.56 (66/67)<br />\n2.58 (67/68) to 2.74 (68/69). The median grade<br />\nfor juniors has moved from 2.60(65/66) to 2.66<br />\n(66/67) to 2.83 (67/68) to 2.89(68/69). The median<br />\ngrade for seniors has advanced rapidly in recent<br />\nyears, from 2.74 (64/65) to 2.76 (65/66) to 2.80<br />\n(66/67) to 2.95 (67/68) to 3.07 (68/69). Thus,during the 68/69 school year, the median grade point<br />\nof the Class of '7Z was Z.71, of the Class of '73<br />\nwas 2.74, of the Class of '70 was 2.89, and of the<br />\nClass of '69 was 3.07.<br />\nThe B-/B school-wide average stands in sharp<br />\ncontrast to the actual level of intellectual thought<br />\nat Hopkins. It is my personal impression--N-L<br />\nreaders please verify or deny this--that the actual<br />\nlevel of undergraduate scholarship at Hopkins is<br />\nquite low. This impression is derived from rapping<br />\nwith several professors; a common complaint is<br />\nthat the buld of the workwhich passes before them<br />\nis at best \"mediocre.\" (This is not to say that<br />\nHopkins students are not conscientious about their<br />\nwork. In a mechanical way, most students seem<br />\nto be rather diligent.) My own impression is that<br />\nso little real \"thinking\" occurs on the undergraduate level at Hopkins that professors richly<br />\nreward any sign of perceptivity and intelligence<br />\nin an effort to encourage it.<br />\nIt should surprise no one that students who avail<br />\nthemselves of the pass-fail option have a higher<br />\nmedian grade-point, than those who do not. The<br />\npass-fail Option can be a powerful tool to enhance<br />\none's cumulative average by providing credit for a<br />\nminimum of work, thereby freeing time to pursue<br />\nhigher grades in other courses.<br />\nGrade fever infects everyone's life at Hopkins.<br />\nThe student who does not want his grades posted is<br />\na freak. More freakish still is the student who objects to the entire concept of posting grades. Receiving a \"C\" is an insult. Being given an \"F\"<br />\ninvolves a moral judgment.<br />\nThe vocabulary of grading at Hopkins is extensive, in proportion to the undergraduate interest<br />\nin the subject. There are \"aces\", \"bases,\"<br />\n\"hooks,\" \"dogs,\" and \"flags\"; students who study<br />\nare, among other things, \"throats\", \"ghouls\",<br />\nand \"grinds\". Everyone in competition with you<br />\n(and believe me, \"cooperative learning\" is a con-<br /><br />\ncept foreign to this University) is \"grade-grubbing.\"<br />\nThe mythology of grading at Hopkins includes<br />\na number of interesting types. The tragic figure<br />\nIs the student who is given an \"A\" in his passfail course; he receives sympathy and consolation. The men from D-level are said to be hybridtypes, acclimiated to hunching over their carreldesks is an atmosphere (this is.embarrassingly<br />\ninane) \"thick with study-juice.\" Comic relief is<br />\nprovided by the student who studies for an entire<br />\nsemester only to \"blow the final.\" In contrast<br />\nto the comic figure is the hero who gets a high<br />\ngrade with only minimum of effort, the student<br />\nwho \"lucks out\" in a course. The archetypal student who \"cheats his way through Hopkins\" is<br />\ngenuinely admired.<br />\nRelated to the subject of grading are the norms<br />\nwhich surround classroom behavior. Speaking out<br />\nin class is taboo. Also taboo is appearing to have<br />\na passionate interest in a subject; students are<br />\nexpected by the peers to maintain a \"cool\" and<br />\ndisinterested front. \"Cutting\"--a practice which<br />\nrecently seems to have become more prevalent-is all part of the game.<br />\nSeveral professors have commented on the fact<br />\nthat students rarely come to ask questions during<br />\noffice hours. Perhaps this is because the students<br />\nknow all the answers; more likely it is because<br />\nthe questions never occur to them. Also,students<br />\nare no doubt reluctant to risk becoming known as<br />\n\"brown-nosers\", \"ass-lickers\", and \"ass-wipers.\" Unenviable reputations!<br />\nHave you ever attended a lecture here? Everyone seems to write down everything (\"it might<br />\nbe on the exam\") and heads bob to the cadence of<br />\ntheindividual professor's sentence. If you ever<br />\n, want to blow your Goddamn mind, just go watch<br />\npeople desperately try to notes as Jackson Cope<br />\n,gives lectures on Shakespeare and James Joyce<br />\nthat are intellectual and theatrical experiences.<br />\nPerhaps paradoxically, despite the admiration<br />\ngranted students who \"pull out a course on the<br />\nfinal,\" a strong notion of \"justice\" operates among Hopkins undergraduates. Each student<br />\n\"ought to get what he deserves,\" and the empathy of the community extends to the student<br />\nwho gets \"screwed\" or \"flicked\" in a course.<br />\nDeserve? \"Use every man after his desert and<br />\nwho shall `scape whipping?\" Few here at Hopkins,<br />\nI should think.<br /><br />\nbefore the mast, aft the head<br />\n0, he's so ded<br />\nicated to that rag<br />\n(ragtag time lag)<br />\nthat several hundred<br />\ncouldn't match his,<br />\ndespike the lick<br />\nof infective<br />\ninvective<br />\nincentive.<br />\nhe was so spoke-softened<br />\n(riding on mirror rims)<br />\nhis bipsychs were andom-lee<br />\nrangular asquare the wills,<br />\nwho resoluted<br />\n(which revolved)<br />\nin a singular lack<br />\n(ah, the elixir)<br />\noffindable fact<br />\n(tractable<br />\nfictitious<br />\nfringes),<br />\nand whioch thus<br />\ncalumniated egregiopiately.<br />\nstephen tulloss<br /><br />\neTiN&amp;..S!<br />\n)rou uus-rREEN DRAFTED.<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nMarch 3, 1970<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nfeatures\u2014.<br />\n'70 Novel: Beyond the'62 Chevy<br />\nBy ELLIOT KRIEGER<br />\nThere's this book that you have to read<br />\nand it's called Nog. It's by Rudolph Wurlitzer and it's a Pocket Books paperback--cheap and attractive. Whenever I<br />\nexplain it to someone, they are convinced not to read it. Grubby Al liked it, but<br />\nI didn't push it on him. So maybe I<br />\nShould stop right here. No, I'll take my<br />\nchances. Just remember; Nog is like the<br />\nmenthol cigar: it sounds terrible but it's<br />\nreally great.<br />\nThere's a blurb by Pynchononthe back<br />\nand that's a step in the right direction.<br />\n\"The Novel of Bullshit is dead...' he<br />\nwrites. I suppose by \"The Novel of Bullshit\" he means the novel which says<br />\nmore than it has to say to get you where<br />\nit's going. That's fair enough. It seems<br />\nthat all of the Major advances in fiction<br />\nsince, say, Dickens, have been in the<br />\nart of paring. Twentieth Century novels<br />\ntend more and more to eliminate fictional<br />\ndevices, explanations, interludes, background.<br />\nThe impact of modern psychology led<br />\ndirectly to a search for interior rather<br />\nthan<br />\nexterior motivation--stream of<br />\nconsciousness became an accepted technique. The influence of the film altered<br />\nour perception of time--the novel could<br />\nnot present jumps in locale without transitional paragraphs, filler. And then<br />\nthere's \"the pace of modern life\"--the<br />\nnovel must be FAST, to reflect the world<br />\naround it; and besides, who has time to<br />\nread a novel?<br /><br />\nUltimate Novel<br />\nEnough of these platitudes. Suffice it<br />\nto say that novels have been picking up<br />\nSpeed, with every advance, that which<br />\nhas been superseded becomes \"bullshit.\" The '62 Chevy looks fat, heavy,<br />\nslow; and they used to be proud of it!<br />\nIt's the same way with fiction.<br />\nWell, if this artichoke peeling is advancement and not just development,<br />\nNog is certainly the ultimate novel; and,<br />\nsince every novelist from now on will be<br />\nWurlitzer in one form or another, just<br />\nread Nog and then go to a lot of movies.<br />\nI can't imagine a novel more modern<br />\nthan Nog. (Of course, if I could I would<br />\nwrite it, and Wurlitzer would write the<br />\nblurb for my book etc.)<br />\nTo tell you a little about the book:<br /><br />\nSo. The narrator becomes an object,<br />\nand consequently objects come to life.<br />\nIn a supermarket; \"fields of waving coffee cans, rows of sweating lemons and<br />\nexpanding lettuce, shifting piles of bananas and candy bars and the food in my<br />\nown cart huddling together, as if for<br />\nwarmth, miniscule and afraid.\"<br /><br />\nIt's really a narator's novel, first person. The narrator (we can call him Nog<br />\nI guess) is the most debased narrator<br />\nyou've ever likely to find. He's entirely passive--does nothing save write this<br />\nbook. Past time is always catching up<br />\nwith present time--\"I am hungry and I<br />\nate\"--giving the impression of a near<br />\ncontinuous present tense, a tape-recorded outline of Nog's functions and acti-<br /><br />\nThe narrator's only feelings are fear,<br />\nhelplessness (\"I am helpless before a<br />\nplan\"), and gratefulness.(\"She made no<br />\nsound when she chewed. For that I am<br />\ngrateful.\"). Otherwise, he exists, he<br />\nwrites the book, he struggles to avoid<br />\nperspective.<br /><br />\nvities.<br /><br />\nUltimate Delineation<br />\nNog, however, does nothing. Everything is done to him. What makes the<br />\nbook so remarkable is the struggle<br />\nwhich Nog as human-being has to dehumanize himself. In that sense, Nog<br />\nis everything a novel should not be--it<br />\nis an attempt to place a fictional construction in absolute stasis. Nog speaks<br />\nto an immobilized hospital patient:<br />\nThere's nothing more to do. Everything has been built, everything said,<br />\neverything ruined. They even control the<br />\nweather. There's no place to go...You've<br />\ngot yourself a decent space. Seventyfive inches by thirty-five inches, give or<br />\ntake a few. You've got it made...\"<br />\nThat is Nog's goal, andNog's goal--ultimate delineation.<br />\nNog believes in a twisted Idealism -things exist only as perception, but imagined perception cannot be distinguished from sensory perception. He<br />\nlimits his memories to three things:<br />\n\"New York for adventure, beaches for<br />\nrelaxation, the octopus and Nog for speculation.\" You see, Nog is not the narrator's name. Nog is a remembered or<br />\nimagined person. Since the narrator has<br />\nno personality of his own, he adopts and<br />\nimprovises upon Nog when he must speak,<br />\nact, or ruminate. But when he does adopt<br />\nNog he is Nog, since he is nothing else.<br />\nMeanwhile, nothing happens. That's<br />\nnot quite true--lots of things happen.<br />\nThe events in Nog are of sufficient magnitude to make this a considerably longer<br />\nbook. But Nog is about the narrator's<br />\nperception, and there are times when he<br />\nsimply is not perceiving. Geographic.<br /><br />\nIt's altogether a horrifying book, but to<br />\nmy mind a most important one. It may<br />\noffer the final answer to the perplexities<br />\nand paradoxes of twentieth century life.<br />\nThere's no place left for romantic retreat; active involvement more often than<br />\nnot leads to catastrophe; and personal<br />\nintellectual elevation is meaningless in<br />\na world of pettiness and objects. Wurlitzer has had the courage to create a<br />\ncharacter who responds to his environment by mimicing it rather than ignoring it or fighting it. Nog is a genetic<br />\nmutant--destined to survive and, if Pynchon is right, reproduce. For that I am<br />\ngrateful.<br /><br />\nAttention All Stones Freaks:<br />\nLiver Than YOU'LL Ever Be<br />\nBy A. MICHAEL HILL<br />\nI'm sure that everyone has heard by<br />\nnow that there is an underground album<br />\nof the Stones' live concert out and that<br />\nit is recorded incredibly well considering its illegitimate origins, and that<br />\nif you didn't catch one of the concerts<br />\nyou could buy a copy of this album and<br />\nhave your own concert right in your room.<br />\nWell, \"That's not really true.\"<br />\nDon't get me wrong, this is a very good<br />\nalbum, but its the type of album you<br />\nshouldn't buy unless you know you're<br />\ngoing to like it before you hear it; in other<br />\nwords, for Stones Freaks only.<br />\nThere is a lot of energy released at<br />\nStones performances, witness Altamont,<br />\nbut only some of this goes into the music.<br />\nOne must remember that the entire arena<br />\nis packed with people who know that THE<br />\nROLLING STONES are about to be RIGHT<br />\nHERE, and as a result, they're about to<br />\nexplode. To give a good concert the Stones<br />\nhave to devote about half of their energy<br />\ninto being the Stones, playing their role<br />\nto the hilt, in order to release all this<br />\nenergy built up.<br /><br />\ntransitions are accomplished swiftly,<br />\nwithout description or presentation of<br />\nmotivation--\"I hitched to San Francisco.\" There are lists, and moments;<br />\nbut no connections.<br /><br />\nKeeping Up The Image<br />\nSo the Stones can't be expected to be as<br />\ntogether up on the stage as, say, Creedence Clearwater Revival; they have to<br /><br />\nplay their roles as well as their instruments, one must also keep in mind that<br />\nthis recording is of the Oakland Concert,<br />\none of the first. Reports have it that the<br />\nStones got better and better as the tour<br />\nwent on, thus this music is not as good<br />\nas that heard in Baltimore and New York.<br />\nSo, just because it's the Stones live and<br />\nyou've heard from a friend who went to a<br />\nconcert that it was great, don't expect<br />\nthis album to be great. A lot of ingredients go into a good Stones concert, and<br />\nthe music is only one.<br />\nJust to keep the image up, the album<br />\nopens with Jagger saying \"Shit,\" apparently over some equipment hassle. Then,<br />\nthey break into an old Chuck Berry song,<br />\n\"Carol.\" A friend of mine who is a dedicated Stones freak believes that if the<br />\nStones were completely free to play the<br />\nmusic they wanted, they would stick to<br />\nold rock 'n roll, and if the guitar playing<br />\nRichards does on this cut and on \"Little<br />\nQueenie\" on the other side is an indication, I'm inclined to agree with him. Very<br />\ntogether, though without the piano they<br />\nused in Baltimore.<br />\nJust to prove their fallibility, the<br />\nStones then proceed to blow \"Gimme<br />\nShelter.\" Rolling Stone's \"Best Cut of<br />\n1969\" just isn't the same without Nicky<br />\nHopkins and Mary Clayton. The Stones<br />\ndropped this song from the rest of their<br />\nconcerts.<br /><br />\nPotpourri Of Percussion<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nSHAME ON SOTI R<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn reading Alex Sotir's letter, I am<br />\nunable to believe that he himself considers what he wrote as factual. His<br />\naccusations and allegations to those at<br />\nwhom he personally directed his letter<br />\nare totally biased and flatly wrong.<br />\nOne can obviously see from the letter that it was directed to the Editor<br />\nof the sports section of the News-Letter, in response to the \"Jay's Nest\"<br />\narticle of Feb. 20th. His implication<br />\nseems to be that the Sports Editor, in<br />\nmaking a statement about a \"bush\" banquet, could only criticize and that the<br />\neditor was \"one who sits on the sidelines<br />\nof all the games of life criticizing and<br />\nunwilling to give of himself.\" This is the<br />\nmost irresponsible accusation toward<br />\nsomeone who has been so heavily involved in in so many activities that I have<br />\never come across. Mr. Sotir seems to<br />\ndirect his accusations at those people who<br />\nare the most involved. Perhaps his letter would have taken on at least some<br />\nrespectability if it had been directed at<br />\nour apathetic gtudent body rather than<br />\nat those who \"put out\" every day, in a<br /><br />\nnumber of areas.<br />\nIn \"thanking God\" for specific individuals on the campus, I fully agree that<br />\nthe Russ Passarellas and Paul Aliens<br />\nget involved and are willing to \"standup<br />\nand be counted.\" They are willing, as<br />\nis the News-Letter Sports Editor, George<br />\nKirschbaum, to get involved every day,in<br />\na number of areas, doing work which is<br />\nnot lauded or reported in the University<br />\n(such as the Student Council, the NewsLetter, Hullaballoo, BIA Secretary,<br />\nOrientation, etc. etc.) They break their<br />\nbacks behind the scenes and they work<br />\nIn thankless and unpublicized areas.<br />\nGranted, playing varsity athletics requires much time during a season and<br />\nthey, the athletes, must put out a great<br />\ndeal. However, far be it from me to believe that those athletes have put out,<br />\ngotten involved, and \"stood up and been<br />\ncounted in the arena of life,' as Mr.<br />\nSotir so eloquently puts it, to the extent<br />\nthat Mr. Kirschbaum has done so.<br />\nIn his \"Jay's Nest\" articles over the<br />\npast year, George Kirschbaum has consistently pushed to get more enthusiasm<br />\nfor Hopkins athletics, has \"stood up\"<br /><br />\nfor Hopkins athletics, and has taken initiative in trying to organize a tournament in Baltimore to complement our<br />\nathletic program. He has met with little<br />\nsupport from the Hopkins Athletic Center, that's for sure. Yet Mr. Sotir disregards all this and has the gall to accuse<br />\nthe Editor being of himself \"bush\" and<br />\ncriticizing without getting involved.<br />\nKirschbaum thought the athletics deserved a better deal at their banquet<br />\nthan they got, yet Sotir has successfully<br />\ntwisted that also. I think Alex Sotir has<br />\ndone a disservice to George Kirschbaum<br />\nin criticizing him when he has worked<br />\nso hard to try and develop some sembl`ance of spirit for Hopkins athletics.<br />\nAlthough a thank-you should bave been<br />\n\u2022the word coming out of the Athletic Office for all George Kirschbaum has done<br />\nIn pushing Hopkins athletics this past<br />\nschool year, Kirschbaum instead has<br />\nbeen criticized for doingsomethingworthwhile and beneficial to Hopkins.<br />\nI think an apology. by Sotir is definitely<br />\nIn order.<br /><br />\nN.<br /><br />\nGary St. Peter<br />\nClass of'72<br /><br />\nThe Stones admirably solved the problem of how to do \"Sympathy for the<br />\nDevil\" on stage by giving Taylor's guitar a large burden of the rhythm responsibilities. His hesitation beat riff, combined with Watts, Fat-back drum beat adequately take the place of the potpurri of<br />\npercussion on Beggar's Banquet. It was<br />\nmuch tighter in Baltimore, but here it<br />\nhas the togetherness of a good jam. This<br />\nis followed up by an oldie, \"I'm Free,\"<br />\nfeaturing a fine break by Mick Taylor, and<br />\na fine vocal by Jaggar. \"Live with Me\"<br />\ncloses out the side; it's fairly good,sticking pretty close to the record.<br />\nThe high point of the album is the<br />\nbeginning of side two; \"Love in Vain,\"<br />\nfeaturing Mick Taylor, is incredible,and<br />\nthat's all one can say. Almost as good is<br />\n\"Midnight Rambler\" which really gets<br />\ntogether after a slow beginning. This is<br />\nfollowed by \"Little Queenie.\" \"A song<br />\nfrom back when we were all fallin' out<br />\nof our cradles.\" A little crowd hype from<br />\nJagger, complete with some crowd-hype<br />\ndrum rolls from Watts, and right into a<br />\nvery powerful \"Honky Tonk Women.\"<br />\nClosing out the album,and the concert,is<br />\n\"Street Fighting Man,\" which sort of<br />\nmoves along on the edge of the wave of<br />\nenergy that's flowing from the crowd.<br />\nAll in all, not bad, but unless you're<br />\nthe type that'll get a kick out of hearing<br />\nJagger rap between songs, you'll probably be disappointed.<br /><br />\nMarch 3,1970<br /><br />\nLandlords Anti-Student Bias<br />\nCreates Housing Problems<br />\nBy HARVEY LUKSENBERG<br /><br />\nOut of the frying pan and into the fire.

It featured<br />\na record breaking thirteen takedowns, in addition<br />\nto four pins and four decisions. The pins were<br />\nregistered by Captain Jack Hanemann (his third of<br />\nthe year), Bob Sanborn, Nick Pratt (his seventh<br />\nof the year), and Marshall Kapp (his first pin of<br />\nthe season).<br /><br />\nEfrrk6:,,,<br />\nHopkins fencers confer with judge before their latest match with<br />\nTemple U. The varsity lost 20-7, while the freshmen capped<br />\na perfect season.<br /><br />\nEveryone else who wrestled below<br />\n158 got a decision over his opponent,except in the<br />\n118 class, which was forfeited by Hopkins. The<br />\nonly true loss was at 167, where Fred Ryland got<br />\nbeaten by C.U.'s Comereski.<br /><br />\nDespite the momentum of the team, the wrestlers lost to a very tough Swarthmore last Saturday by a score of 21-18. Actually, after the 190<br />\nlb. weight class, the score was tied 18-18,and it<br />\ntook a good match by their unlimited wrestler,<br />\nByers, to secure a victory. Highlights of the match<br />\nwere Turshen's fourth pin of the season, Hanemann's fourth also, Betta's decision at 142, Sanborn's draw with Lazzeri, and Jim McMenamin<br />\ndecision at 190 lbs.(wrestling for Pratt).<br />\nToday and tomorrow, the Mason-Dixon Championships are being held at Towson, followed by<br />\nthe MAC Championships the following week at<br />\nWilkes. Despite last week's loss, Hopkins has been<br />\ntough in the last three matches, and should continue to do well in the championships.
