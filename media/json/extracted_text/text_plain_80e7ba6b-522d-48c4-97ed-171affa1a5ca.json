Even<br />\nso many of his students from the<br />\n35 universities he has taught at,<br />\nfrom Heidelberg to Peking to<br />\nMcGill, to members of the British<br />\nParliament will testify that he<br />\nknows his way in the world of<br />\npolitics.<br />\nIn 1926 the white-haired<br />\nyrofessor came to the United<br />\nStates to head the Rockefeller<br />\nInvestigation on Prohibition. In<br />\nthat way he had an influence on<br />\nthe U.S. Constitution, Years later<br />\nhe met with Mahatma Ghandi in<br />\nIndia; once while the Mahatma<br />\nwas in the bathtub. In that way<br />\nhe was involved with India<br />\nindependence, a major change in<br />\nAsia.<br />\nHe has served as an advisor to<br />\nLabor Party leader Arthur<br />\nGreenwood, six American<br />\nPresidents, and one also-ran,<br />\nWendell Wilkie. Along with H.G.<br />\nWells he co-founded Realist<br />\nMagazine. But his career in<br />\npolitics is still going on.<br />\nPresidently Sir George is an<br />\nadvisor to Harold Wilson as an<br />\nexpert on International Affairs,<br />\nwhile his daughter serves as the<br />\n<br />\nSecretary of the Interior for<br />\nWilson's Shadow Labor<br />\nGovernment.<br />\nSo much a part of his life is<br />\ncommited to politics that he has<br />\nwritten his autobiography, which<br />\nwill appear soon, with the title<br />\nFor God's Sake Go!. It's aimed at<br />\nthe defeat of lhe- present Prime<br />\nMinister Edward Heath, which<br />\nCatlin expects in the next British<br />\nelection.<br />\nMuch of his dislike of Heath is<br />\nbased on his opposition to<br />\nBritain's entry in a Common<br />\nMarket dominated by the<br />\nFrench. \"I am not opposed to<br />\nthe Common Market as such, but<br />\nam opposed to French<br />\ndomination of the Common<br />\nMarket. French policy is<br />\nFrench-centered. It always has<br />\nbeen and it is now. We must<br />\nrecognize that this is so,\" Catlin<br />\nasserts.<br />\nTurning to another major<br />\ntopic in British political life Sir<br />\nGeorge Catlin says that Ireland<br />\nmust be regarded as a united<br />\ncountry. As a solution to the<br />\nfighting he suggests that a<br />\ncommittee of British jurors draft<br />\na bill of minority rights to<br />\nprotect both Catholics and<br />\nProtestants. He concludes that if<br />\nthe Irish do not accept<br />\nreasonable terms, the British<br />\nsoldiers should be withdrawn<br />\nbecause it is wrong to sacrifice<br />\nother British subjects for Irish<br />\nhard-headedness.<br />\n<br />\nCommenting on recent U.S.<br />\nforeign policy, he asserts, \"The<br />\nU.S. State Department has been<br />\ntoo concerned with Vietnam to<br />\nshape a European policy.\"<br />\nSir George says that he has<br />\nbeen delighted with Hopkins in<br />\nterms of students, faculty and<br />\nBaltimore, but he doesn't just<br />\nconfine himself to the<br />\nHomewood campus, even for the<br />\nterm of his visiting professorship.<br />\nThis semester he lectures at<br />\neight other campuses located in<br />\nMaryland, Washington,<br />\nMassachusetts and Texas.

Where the<br />\ndemonstrations weren't openly in support<br />\nof the liberal wing of the Democratic<br />\nparty, as at Hopkins, they were channeled<br />\ninto single issue, campus based \"actions.\"<br />\nAttempts were made to broaden the<br />\nprotests to opposition to Phase II-III<br />\npolicies or to seek ties with oppressed<br />\nworking class elements; unions, welfare<br />\nvictims, etc. These attempts were<br />\nsquelched by the anti-collectivist<br />\nattitudes of most student activists and the<br />\nconcerted actions of various left<br />\ntendencies: PCPJ, YSA,and PL.<br />\nThe tragicomedy of the peace<br />\nmovement beating their heads against the<br />\nwall again may be over for this spring.<br />\nHowever increased austerity will continue<br />\nto produce social dislocations. There is no<br />\nplace outside of med school to escape the<br />\nprocess of social decay. The apathy which<br />\nis cultivated at this campus will become<br />\neven more absurd than Muller's moral<br />\nindignation against the war as he slowly<br />\ndismantles the university. The student<br />\npopulation must confront the<br />\n;<br />\n<br />\nwomen<br />\n<br />\nCongressman Ron Dellums's speech Wednesday night<br />\nwill represent a viewpoint not often presented on the<br />\nHomewood campus. Not only is Dellums a radical from<br />\nBerkeley, he is also a black. And those two distinctions<br />\nmake the presentation of his speech, as this year's<br />\nspeaker for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Lecture series<br />\nespecially worthy of support by the Hopkins community.<br />\nBut the Student Council and the administration were<br />\nslow to offer the support that they should have. Weeks<br />\nago, there was a move by the Student Council to cancel<br />\nthe lecture in an effort to save money to pay off the<br />\ndebts incurred by the Council-sponsored Hopkins Fair,<br />\n3400 On Stage. This idea is not difficult to understand,<br />\nbut the elimination of any lecture, whether it be sponsored by the Black Student Union or by the Eisenhower Symposium, is detremental to campus life<br />\nbecause it limits the scope of student exposure.<br />\nThe administration did not take any definite stand<br />\nwhile the Council was still indecisive. Their goals<br />\nshould be closely tied to those of the Council. But even<br />\nthey had an excuse for not trying to take action'on the<br />\nspeech: the King series is a student-run proposition and<br />\nthe administration did not want to get involved making<br />\ndecisions. But still, they should not have let members<br />\nof the Council kill the series without offering some<br />\nadvice of their own.<br />\n<br />\nBy ROBERT RUBY<br />\n\"One news pa pc r man interviewing<br />\nanother is really absurd.

Wicker got radicalized (I<br />\nhate that word, radicalized) at the<br />\nChicago Convention.\"<br />\nBaker speaks quietly in the sense that<br />\nhe doesn't interrupt other people's<br />\ninterruptions or questions. His tone<br />\nremains the same whether he's talking<br />\nabout colleagues, enemies, or answering<br />\nquestions about himself. Regardless of<br />\nthe question, his answer comes very<br />\n<br />\nquickly.<br />\n\"Whatever you call it. I do it,\" is the<br />\nphrase he uses to draw or erase the line<br />\nbetween journalism and writing. \"I hate<br />\nthe writing game.

I agree with George<br />\nScott\u2014I'm not willing to accept the<br />\nprize.\"<br />\nBaker was reluctant to list his favorite<br />\nhumorists. He explained, \"If ,I start<br />\nmentioning people, I'll forget<br />\nsomebody.\" Woody Allen and S.J.<br />\nPerelman were two of the elect, but then<br />\nhe brought him own humor up for<br />\nscrutiny:<br />\n\"I'm not interested in shocking smug<br />\npeople.

The people voting in the<br />\nprimaries are the party regulars, the hacks<br />\nthe machines get out, and angry people<br />\nwho might not be angry by election day.<br />\nI think the press has distorted the<br />\npublic's understanding of what the<br />\nprimaries are.

Their almost<br />\ncommonplace brilliant showings<br />\nat times overshadowed the<br />\nenormous strides made by the<br />\nUniversity along the road to<br />\nrespectability in intercollegiate<br />\nathletics.<br />\nWith the spring sports schedule<br />\nwinding through its final weeks,<br />\neight of the school's twelve<br />\nvarsity sports have notched or<br />\n<br />\nhave assured themselves of<br />\nwinning seasons. This success is<br />\nin sharp contrast to only last year<br />\nwhen but four Blue Jay squads<br />\nwon more times than they lost.<br />\nMilne's credentials are, in a<br />\nword, overwhelming.

Milne and<br />\nThomas, however, weren't the<br />\nentire story; with rare<br />\nexceptions, 1971-72 saw Blue<br />\nJay varsity teams enjoy<br />\nunparalleled success. Football<br />\ncoach Dennis Cox finished his<br />\nfirst year at the helm with a 6-3<br />\nledger after seeing his charges \u2022<br />\ndrop their first two contests.

Leading the Blue Jay<br />\nscorers were sophomore stars<br />\nBilly Nolan and Jack Thomas.<br />\n<br />\nSophomore Bob Barbera, a swift<br />\naggressive defenseman, was an<br />\nimportant factor in making the<br />\nman down unit successful, and<br />\nhis clear breaking play, was<br />\neffective, as it has been all year.<br />\nThe first ten minutes of the<br />\ngame gave no hint of the eventual<br />\nrout as Ron Lanning won the<br />\nopening face off for Navy, who<br />\ncontrolled the ball for much of<br />\nthe early going. Luck was with<br />\nHopkins, though, as the<br />\nMidshipmen had some erratic<br />\npasses and missed some excellent<br />\nscoring opportunities. Three<br />\nHopkins penalties in the first half<br />\nof the period kept the Blue Jays<br />\non the extra man defense, but<br />\nNavy could not capitalize as<br />\nMatthews turned aside the few<br />\nshots the defenders allowed.<br />\nThe most blatant example of<br />\nthe Blue Jay good fortunes came<br />\nshortly after Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nbroke the ice with his hard rising<br />\nit;<br />\n<br />\nNolan scores twelfth Jay goal as he is hit.<br />\nNolan netted four goals in the<br />\ngame to match his Virginia feat<br />\nand Thomas continued his<br />\nscoring spree with two goals and<br />\nfour assists in spite of the<br />\ndefensive efforts of John<br />\nMcFarland and Chuck Voith.<br />\nCaptain Gary Handleman also<br />\nhad a fine day, adding two goals<br />\nwhile setting up two others for<br />\nhis high game of the season.<br />\nMatthews Brilliant!<br />\nIn spite of the superb offensive<br />\ncannonade, the performance that<br />\nstood out was Les Matthews'<br />\nbrilliant net tending. In three and<br />\na half periods, Les made 13 saves<br />\nwhile giving up only two goals.<br />\nNot only did Matthews save<br />\npoint-blank shots and hard<br />\noutside bouncers, he also<br />\nintercepted several feeds through<br />\nthe crease to snuff out Navy<br />\nthreats.<br />\nProviding Matthews with the<br />\nfine support that makes a good<br />\ngoalie look even better, the<br />\ndefense once again blanketed a<br />\nhigh scoring offense. Ferguson<br />\nwas an albatross for Navy star<br />\nDave Bayly, the sophomore<br />\nmanaging a few decent shots,<br />\nnetting only one in the game.<br />\nHead also played superbly,<br />\nespecially excelling on Blue Jay<br />\nclears. Also assigned to a potent<br />\nattackman in Bob Pell,<br />\nCieslowski was occassionally<br />\ndrawn from his usual crease<br />\nposition but did not compromise<br />\nhis coverage.<br />\nFurthermore, the extra-man<br />\ndefense harried the Navy power<br />\nplay, holding it scoreless.<br />\n<br />\nshot which gave Hopkins a 1-0<br />\nadvantage. Navy followed up<br />\nwith a three-on-one break but<br />\nbotched the opportunity when<br />\nthe first pass went astray.<br />\nTide Turns<br />\nThen the tide began to turn<br />\nfor Hopkins as Navy's<br />\ndomination of play subsided. The<br />\nMidshipmen were on the attack<br />\nagain, but Handleman made a<br />\nsparkling play when he stole the<br />\nball out of Dave Walla's stick,<br />\n<br />\nand found Thomas free for the<br />\nsecond tally of the game.<br />\nMoments later, a Navy penalty<br />\ngave Hopkins the man advantage.<br />\nIn typical power play style,<br />\nThomas saw Ken Winegrad make<br />\nhis move to the goal and fed him<br />\nat the crease for the third<br />\nHopkins goal.<br />\nTwo and a half minutes into<br />\nthe second quarter, with the<br />\nscore 3-1, Nolan netted his first<br />\ngoal of the game on the standard<br />\nHopkins fast break play that has<br />\nhim stationed off the left pipe.<br />\nHandleman drew the defender<br />\nout and passed to the Annapolis<br />\nstar, whose shot set off the<br />\ncannon.<br />\nMidway through the period,<br />\nThomas broke another Navy<br />\nclear at midfield and carried the<br />\nball straight to the goal. When<br />\nthe defender covering Don Krohn<br />\npicked up Thomas, Jack made an<br />\nunderhand forward flip pass to<br />\nKrohn, who slammed the ball<br />\ninto the net.<br />\nAfter Navy scored again on the<br />\nfast break, Coach Bob Scott sent<br />\nfreshman Ron Hall in for the face<br />\noff. Hall was successful against<br />\nLanning for much of the<br />\nafternoon, and this strategem<br />\ngave Hopkins the final edge that<br />\nproved so devastating.<br />\nIn a tangle for a loose ground<br />\nball at the Hopkins restraining<br />\nline moments later, Pat Sinram<br />\ncame up with the scoop. He<br />\nbrought the ball all the way to<br />\n'he Navy crease, evading five<br />\ndefenders along the way. His<br />\nbounce shot gave Hopkins a 6-2<br />\nlead with thiee minutes left in<br />\nthe half.<br />\nBefore the gun sounded,<br />\nThomas teamed up with<br />\nHandleman for a pair of tallies<br />\nwithin 35 seconds. On the first<br />\nscore, Gary cut behind a Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon pick to take the<br />\nfeed while open off the crease.<br />\nThen Thomas found Handleman<br />\nstanding alone at the crease as<br />\nthe Navy defense shifted away<br />\nand Gary netted his seventh goal<br />\nof the season.<br />\nThe opening barrage of the<br />\nsecond half ended all hopes of an<br />\ninspired comeback by the<br />\n<br />\nThomas scores to open second half<br />\noverwhelmed Navy squad.

Even<br />\nso many of his students from the<br />\n35 universities he has taught at,<br />\nfrom Heidelberg to Peking to<br />\nMcGill, to members of the British<br />\nParliament will testify that he<br />\nknows his way in the world of<br />\npolitics.<br />\nIn 1926 the white-haired<br />\nyrofessor came to the United<br />\nStates to head the Rockefeller<br />\nInvestigation on Prohibition. In<br />\nthat way he had an influence on<br />\nthe U.S. Constitution, Years later<br />\nhe met with Mahatma Ghandi in<br />\nIndia; once while the Mahatma<br />\nwas in the bathtub. In that way<br />\nhe was involved with India<br />\nindependence, a major change in<br />\nAsia.<br />\nHe has served as an advisor to<br />\nLabor Party leader Arthur<br />\nGreenwood, six American<br />\nPresidents, and one also-ran,<br />\nWendell Wilkie. Along with H.G.<br />\nWells he co-founded Realist<br />\nMagazine. But his career in<br />\npolitics is still going on.<br />\nPresidently Sir George is an<br />\nadvisor to Harold Wilson as an<br />\nexpert on International Affairs,<br />\nwhile his daughter serves as the<br /><br />\nSecretary of the Interior for<br />\nWilson's Shadow Labor<br />\nGovernment.<br />\nSo much a part of his life is<br />\ncommited to politics that he has<br />\nwritten his autobiography, which<br />\nwill appear soon, with the title<br />\nFor God's Sake Go!. It's aimed at<br />\nthe defeat of lhe- present Prime<br />\nMinister Edward Heath, which<br />\nCatlin expects in the next British<br />\nelection.<br />\nMuch of his dislike of Heath is<br />\nbased on his opposition to<br />\nBritain's entry in a Common<br />\nMarket dominated by the<br />\nFrench. \"I am not opposed to<br />\nthe Common Market as such, but<br />\nam opposed to French<br />\ndomination of the Common<br />\nMarket. French policy is<br />\nFrench-centered. It always has<br />\nbeen and it is now. We must<br />\nrecognize that this is so,\" Catlin<br />\nasserts.<br />\nTurning to another major<br />\ntopic in British political life Sir<br />\nGeorge Catlin says that Ireland<br />\nmust be regarded as a united<br />\ncountry.

Where the<br />\ndemonstrations weren't openly in support<br />\nof the liberal wing of the Democratic<br />\nparty, as at Hopkins, they were channeled<br />\ninto single issue, campus based \"actions.\"<br />\nAttempts were made to broaden the<br />\nprotests to opposition to Phase II-III<br />\npolicies or to seek ties with oppressed<br />\nworking class elements; unions, welfare<br />\nvictims, etc. These attempts were<br />\nsquelched by the anti-collectivist<br />\nattitudes of most student activists and the<br />\nconcerted actions of various left<br />\ntendencies: PCPJ, YSA,and PL.<br />\nThe tragicomedy of the peace<br />\nmovement beating their heads against the<br />\nwall again may be over for this spring.<br />\nHowever increased austerity will continue<br />\nto produce social dislocations. There is no<br />\nplace outside of med school to escape the<br />\nprocess of social decay.

The student<br />\npopulation must confront the<br />\n;<br /><br />\nwomen<br /><br />\nCongressman Ron Dellums's speech Wednesday night<br />\nwill represent a viewpoint not often presented on the<br />\nHomewood campus. Not only is Dellums a radical from<br />\nBerkeley, he is also a black. And those two distinctions<br />\nmake the presentation of his speech, as this year's<br />\nspeaker for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Lecture series<br />\nespecially worthy of support by the Hopkins community.<br />\nBut the Student Council and the administration were<br />\nslow to offer the support that they should have. Weeks<br />\nago, there was a move by the Student Council to cancel<br />\nthe lecture in an effort to save money to pay off the<br />\ndebts incurred by the Council-sponsored Hopkins Fair,<br />\n3400 On Stage. This idea is not difficult to understand,<br />\nbut the elimination of any lecture, whether it be sponsored by the Black Student Union or by the Eisenhower Symposium, is detremental to campus life<br />\nbecause it limits the scope of student exposure.<br />\nThe administration did not take any definite stand<br />\nwhile the Council was still indecisive. Their goals<br />\nshould be closely tied to those of the Council. But even<br />\nthey had an excuse for not trying to take action'on the<br />\nspeech: the King series is a student-run proposition and<br />\nthe administration did not want to get involved making<br />\ndecisions.

Wicker got radicalized (I<br />\nhate that word, radicalized) at the<br />\nChicago Convention.\"<br />\nBaker speaks quietly in the sense that<br />\nhe doesn't interrupt other people's<br />\ninterruptions or questions. His tone<br />\nremains the same whether he's talking<br />\nabout colleagues, enemies, or answering<br />\nquestions about himself. Regardless of<br />\nthe question, his answer comes very<br /><br />\nquickly.<br />\n\"Whatever you call it. I do it,\" is the<br />\nphrase he uses to draw or erase the line<br />\nbetween journalism and writing. \"I hate<br />\nthe writing game.

I agree with George<br />\nScott\u2014I'm not willing to accept the<br />\nprize.\"<br />\nBaker was reluctant to list his favorite<br />\nhumorists. He explained, \"If ,I start<br />\nmentioning people, I'll forget<br />\nsomebody.\" Woody Allen and S.J.<br />\nPerelman were two of the elect, but then<br />\nhe brought him own humor up for<br />\nscrutiny:<br />\n\"I'm not interested in shocking smug<br />\npeople.

The people voting in the<br />\nprimaries are the party regulars, the hacks<br />\nthe machines get out, and angry people<br />\nwho might not be angry by election day.<br />\nI think the press has distorted the<br />\npublic's understanding of what the<br />\nprimaries are. The Times labeled Muskie's<br />\nvictory in New Hampshire, with 48<br />\npercent of the vote, a poor showing; but<br />\nthe 42 percent Wallace got in Florida was<br />\ncalled a smashing victory.

Satisfied with the progress of his<br />\nargument, he continued, \"We have to<br />\nwork to overcome these handicaps and<br />\nturn them into benefits.\" He directed this<br />\ninsight towards the North Carolina<br />\nstudent, who he was trying to enlist in a<br />\ncounselling career.<br />\nThe girl sat perched on her seat in a<br />\ntiny pink outfit, saying little. She spoke<br />\nup finally, in a quiet, reserved, deferential<br />\nmanner. She bent her head down and<br />\nsaid,\"If you're not short, I don't see how<br />\nyou can counsel them. You don't know<br />\ntheir problems.\" She glanced at him and<br />\nthen averted her eyes.<br />\n\"I don't agree with you,\" he answered<br />\nwith a modest smile. He took a relaxed<br />\npuff and leaned forward with both hands<br />\non the table, the cigarette smoke curling<br />\nupwards in lazy circles. \"You don't have<br />\nto become an alcoholic to counsel one,<br />\nyou know.\" The girls made no answer.<br />\nI was directly across from him,staring<br />\ndown grimly at my food.

Leading the Blue Jay<br />\nscorers were sophomore stars<br />\nBilly Nolan and Jack Thomas.<br /><br />\nSophomore Bob Barbera, a swift<br />\naggressive defenseman, was an<br />\nimportant factor in making the<br />\nman down unit successful, and<br />\nhis clear breaking play, was<br />\neffective, as it has been all year.<br />\nThe first ten minutes of the<br />\ngame gave no hint of the eventual<br />\nrout as Ron Lanning won the<br />\nopening face off for Navy, who<br />\ncontrolled the ball for much of<br />\nthe early going. Luck was with<br />\nHopkins, though, as the<br />\nMidshipmen had some erratic<br />\npasses and missed some excellent<br />\nscoring opportunities. Three<br />\nHopkins penalties in the first half<br />\nof the period kept the Blue Jays<br />\non the extra man defense, but<br />\nNavy could not capitalize as<br />\nMatthews turned aside the few<br />\nshots the defenders allowed.<br />\nThe most blatant example of<br />\nthe Blue Jay good fortunes came<br />\nshortly after Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nbroke the ice with his hard rising<br />\nit;<br /><br />\nNolan scores twelfth Jay goal as he is hit.<br />\nNolan netted four goals in the<br />\ngame to match his Virginia feat<br />\nand Thomas continued his<br />\nscoring spree with two goals and<br />\nfour assists in spite of the<br />\ndefensive efforts of John<br />\nMcFarland and Chuck Voith.<br />\nCaptain Gary Handleman also<br />\nhad a fine day, adding two goals<br />\nwhile setting up two others for<br />\nhis high game of the season.<br />\nMatthews Brilliant!<br />\nIn spite of the superb offensive<br />\ncannonade, the performance that<br />\nstood out was Les Matthews'<br />\nbrilliant net tending. In three and<br />\na half periods, Les made 13 saves<br />\nwhile giving up only two goals.<br />\nNot only did Matthews save<br />\npoint-blank shots and hard<br />\noutside bouncers, he also<br />\nintercepted several feeds through<br />\nthe crease to snuff out Navy<br />\nthreats.<br />\nProviding Matthews with the<br />\nfine support that makes a good<br />\ngoalie look even better, the<br />\ndefense once again blanketed a<br />\nhigh scoring offense. Ferguson<br />\nwas an albatross for Navy star<br />\nDave Bayly, the sophomore<br />\nmanaging a few decent shots,<br />\nnetting only one in the game.<br />\nHead also played superbly,<br />\nespecially excelling on Blue Jay<br />\nclears. Also assigned to a potent<br />\nattackman in Bob Pell,<br />\nCieslowski was occassionally<br />\ndrawn from his usual crease<br />\nposition but did not compromise<br />\nhis coverage.<br />\nFurthermore, the extra-man<br />\ndefense harried the Navy power<br />\nplay, holding it scoreless.<br /><br />\nshot which gave Hopkins a 1-0<br />\nadvantage. Navy followed up<br />\nwith a three-on-one break but<br />\nbotched the opportunity when<br />\nthe first pass went astray.<br />\nTide Turns<br />\nThen the tide began to turn<br />\nfor Hopkins as Navy's<br />\ndomination of play subsided. The<br />\nMidshipmen were on the attack<br />\nagain, but Handleman made a<br />\nsparkling play when he stole the<br />\nball out of Dave Walla's stick,<br /><br />\nand found Thomas free for the<br />\nsecond tally of the game.<br />\nMoments later, a Navy penalty<br />\ngave Hopkins the man advantage.<br />\nIn typical power play style,<br />\nThomas saw Ken Winegrad make<br />\nhis move to the goal and fed him<br />\nat the crease for the third<br />\nHopkins goal.<br />\nTwo and a half minutes into<br />\nthe second quarter, with the<br />\nscore 3-1, Nolan netted his first<br />\ngoal of the game on the standard<br />\nHopkins fast break play that has<br />\nhim stationed off the left pipe.<br />\nHandleman drew the defender<br />\nout and passed to the Annapolis<br />\nstar, whose shot set off the<br />\ncannon.<br />\nMidway through the period,<br />\nThomas broke another Navy<br />\nclear at midfield and carried the<br />\nball straight to the goal. When<br />\nthe defender covering Don Krohn<br />\npicked up Thomas, Jack made an<br />\nunderhand forward flip pass to<br />\nKrohn, who slammed the ball<br />\ninto the net.<br />\nAfter Navy scored again on the<br />\nfast break, Coach Bob Scott sent<br />\nfreshman Ron Hall in for the face<br />\noff. Hall was successful against<br />\nLanning for much of the<br />\nafternoon, and this strategem<br />\ngave Hopkins the final edge that<br />\nproved so devastating.<br />\nIn a tangle for a loose ground<br />\nball at the Hopkins restraining<br />\nline moments later, Pat Sinram<br />\ncame up with the scoop. He<br />\nbrought the ball all the way to<br />\n'he Navy crease, evading five<br />\ndefenders along the way. His<br />\nbounce shot gave Hopkins a 6-2<br />\nlead with thiee minutes left in<br />\nthe half.<br />\nBefore the gun sounded,<br />\nThomas teamed up with<br />\nHandleman for a pair of tallies<br />\nwithin 35 seconds. On the first<br />\nscore, Gary cut behind a Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon pick to take the<br />\nfeed while open off the crease.<br />\nThen Thomas found Handleman<br />\nstanding alone at the crease as<br />\nthe Navy defense shifted away<br />\nand Gary netted his seventh goal<br />\nof the season.<br />\nThe opening barrage of the<br />\nsecond half ended all hopes of an<br />\ninspired comeback by the<br /><br />\nThomas scores to open second half<br />\noverwhelmed Navy squad. Jack<br />\nThomas scored one minute into<br />\nthe half, inspite of excellent<br />\ncoverage by McFarland, when he<br />\nshot under the defender's stick<br />\nand hit the smallest of openings<br />\nin the net.
