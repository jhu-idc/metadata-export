Lane, which was recently<br />\nissued, the facts of military training in colleges were presented,<br />\nand compulsory military training was opposed. A number of<br />\nwell known people signed the pamphlet, including Senator<br />\nBorah, the late Senator La Follette, Jane Addams, Oswald<br />\nGarrison IIllard, and others of equal prominence.<br />\nTo us the most striking part of the pamphlet was that<br />\npresenting the several views of the R. 0. T. C. to the parents,<br />\nthe army officers, and the students. We reproduce in toto:<br />\n\"To American Fathers and Mothers:<br />\n\"The purpose of this book is not to make soldiers out<br />\nof your boys, but to develop them physically, morally and<br />\nmentally into the best type of citizens, capable of defending<br />\nour flag should an emergency arise . . .

They are being trained to be soldiers, and<br />\nthe model should actually be before them.\"--T. D. R. for<br />\nuse with R. 0. T. C.<br />\n\"To Students:<br />\n\"Success in battle, whether attack or defense, is the<br />\naim of all military training.

C. Manual.<br />\nThe obvious insincerity of the military authorities cannot<br />\nbe enlarged upon,\u2014one only need read the italicized lines<br />\nabove. But, while this goes to create a distrust in the purpose of the R. 0. T. C. throughout the country, we are concerned with the 'Hopkins unit alone.<br />\nWe hold no brief for the abolition of the student military<br />\ntraining. Some enthusiasts enjoy it, get a great deal from<br />\nthe course, and undoubtedly have the right to study Military<br />\nScience and Tactics as much as we have to indulge our pen:<br />\nchant for Sanscrit or the Elements of Heat Engineering. But<br />\nwhy, we ask, does the student have to take R. 0. T. C., or<br />\nenter into a supposed course in Physical Training?<br />\nIt is well known. that the \"P. T.\" at this University has<br />\nbeen a farce for a number of years; the students themselves<br />\nrefer to_it as `Pitiful Training.\" A few arm wavings once a<br />\nweek, a few lectures on personal hygiene, a few ineffective<br />\nsoccer games under the supervision of a bored army non-commissioned officer,\u2014these have no effect whatsoever upon the<br />\nphysical well-being of the student. And yet he is offered a<br />\nchoice of It O. T. C. or this.<br />\nThe R. 0. T. C., on the other hand, is a bugbear to the<br />\naverage student. By the time he reaches his sophomore year<br />\nhe refers to it as \"the damn army.\" He swears at the drill,<br />\nat the stupid methods of the instructors, becomes generally<br />\ndisgruntled, and hastens to turn in his uniform when he is<br />\nfinally released. The few who do like the work go ahead for<br />\nfurther,training, and it is for these that the course should be<br />\nmaintained.<br />\n\"The R. 0. T. C. was established during the war, and is<br />\nstill continued. If we thought that it were not beneficial,<br />\nthe course would not now be on the university curriculum.\"<br />\nThus spoke President Goodnow in an interview in the Evening<br />\nSun. He further intimated that the physical benefit was great.<br />\nAsk the men who left the unit at the end of their second year<br />\nof forced drilling how much it improved their posture, their<br />\nphysical well-being. Rather the drilling on cold, dark afternoons, after a day of classroom work, tends \u2022to tire the man,<br />\nand prevent full application on his studies for the next day.<br />\nIn our opinion, certain changes should be made in the<br />\nR. p. T. C.-Physical Training at Hopkins. Either a real course<br />\nin physical ti aining should be offered, so the student would<br />\nhave a worthwhile alternative to select instead of Military<br />\nTraining, or \"P. T.\" should be abolished entirely, and let the<br />\nmen make a choice between R. 0. T. C. and nothing.<br />\nFurthermore, dragooning of bewildered freshmen by army<br />\nofficers should come to an end. Students should be allowed to<br />\nmake their choice freely, instead of having bribes of clothing,<br />\nmoney, and academic credits urged upon them when they go<br />\nto the Military Office to sign up for one of the two alternative<br />\ncourses. More than one freshman has been dragged into the<br />\nR. 0. T. C. against his will, by tactics more becoming to a<br />\nrecruiting sergeant than a commissioned officer.<br />\nFinally, no one should be illusioned about the object of\u2022<br />\nR. 0. 1. C. In spite of the bunk ladled out by the War Department on citizenship, physical training, and training of the<br />\nmind, the object of the student training is to build up a large<br />\nreserve force, to make soldiers, to teach men to win battles.<br />\nWe call for a remodeling of the system at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nWe feel that a large minority, if not a Majority, of the students agree with us in substance.

It may even be that it was the truth in the<br />\ncase of a few of them. But what about the score who never so<br />\nmuch as thought of the \"pressure of studies\"? Is it fair that<br />\nthey, too, should be held up to the scorn and ridicule of their<br />\nclassmates because of this libelous intimation that they have a<br />\nthirst for knowledge?

But is it the most<br />\nenlightening? Resignations are not frequent at a place like<br />\nHopkins, where activities honors are bitterly contested ;\u2014would<br />\nit not be interesting, perhaps valuable, to know the whys and<br />\nwherefores of the infrequent withdrawals?<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nOf course, this matter is itself a comparatively insignificant one.

Lane, which was recently<br />\nissued, the facts of military training in colleges were presented,<br />\nand compulsory military training was opposed. A number of<br />\nwell known people signed the pamphlet, including Senator<br />\nBorah, the late Senator La Follette, Jane Addams, Oswald<br />\nGarrison IIllard, and others of equal prominence.<br />\nTo us the most striking part of the pamphlet was that<br />\npresenting the several views of the R. 0. T. C. to the parents,<br />\nthe army officers, and the students. We reproduce in toto:<br />\n\"To American Fathers and Mothers:<br />\n\"The purpose of this book is not to make soldiers out<br />\nof your boys, but to develop them physically, morally and<br />\nmentally into the best type of citizens, capable of defending<br />\nour flag should an emergency arise . . .

They are being trained to be soldiers, and<br />\nthe model should actually be before them.\"--T. D. R. for<br />\nuse with R. 0. T. C.<br />\n\"To Students:<br />\n\"Success in battle, whether attack or defense, is the<br />\naim of all military training.

But, while this goes to create a distrust in the purpose of the R. 0. T. C. throughout the country, we are concerned with the 'Hopkins unit alone.<br />\nWe hold no brief for the abolition of the student military<br />\ntraining. Some enthusiasts enjoy it, get a great deal from<br />\nthe course, and undoubtedly have the right to study Military<br />\nScience and Tactics as much as we have to indulge our pen:<br />\nchant for Sanscrit or the Elements of Heat Engineering. But<br />\nwhy, we ask, does the student have to take R. 0. T. C., or<br />\nenter into a supposed course in Physical Training?<br />\nIt is well known. that the \"P. T.\" at this University has<br />\nbeen a farce for a number of years; the students themselves<br />\nrefer to_it as `Pitiful Training.\" A few arm wavings once a<br />\nweek, a few lectures on personal hygiene, a few ineffective<br />\nsoccer games under the supervision of a bored army non-commissioned officer,\u2014these have no effect whatsoever upon the<br />\nphysical well-being of the student. And yet he is offered a<br />\nchoice of It O. T. C. or this.<br />\nThe R. 0. T. C., on the other hand, is a bugbear to the<br />\naverage student. By the time he reaches his sophomore year<br />\nhe refers to it as \"the damn army.\" He swears at the drill,<br />\nat the stupid methods of the instructors, becomes generally<br />\ndisgruntled, and hastens to turn in his uniform when he is<br />\nfinally released. The few who do like the work go ahead for<br />\nfurther,training, and it is for these that the course should be<br />\nmaintained.<br />\n\"The R. 0. T. C. was established during the war, and is<br />\nstill continued. If we thought that it were not beneficial,<br />\nthe course would not now be on the university curriculum.\"<br />\nThus spoke President Goodnow in an interview in the Evening<br />\nSun. He further intimated that the physical benefit was great.<br />\nAsk the men who left the unit at the end of their second year<br />\nof forced drilling how much it improved their posture, their<br />\nphysical well-being. Rather the drilling on cold, dark afternoons, after a day of classroom work, tends \u2022to tire the man,<br />\nand prevent full application on his studies for the next day.<br />\nIn our opinion, certain changes should be made in the<br />\nR. p. T. C.-Physical Training at Hopkins. Either a real course<br />\nin physical ti aining should be offered, so the student would<br />\nhave a worthwhile alternative to select instead of Military<br />\nTraining, or \"P. T.\" should be abolished entirely, and let the<br />\nmen make a choice between R. 0. T. C. and nothing.<br />\nFurthermore, dragooning of bewildered freshmen by army<br />\nofficers should come to an end. Students should be allowed to<br />\nmake their choice freely, instead of having bribes of clothing,<br />\nmoney, and academic credits urged upon them when they go<br />\nto the Military Office to sign up for one of the two alternative<br />\ncourses. More than one freshman has been dragged into the<br />\nR. 0. T. C. against his will, by tactics more becoming to a<br />\nrecruiting sergeant than a commissioned officer.<br />\nFinally, no one should be illusioned about the object of\u2022<br />\nR. 0. 1. C. In spite of the bunk ladled out by the War Department on citizenship, physical training, and training of the<br />\nmind, the object of the student training is to build up a large<br />\nreserve force, to make soldiers, to teach men to win battles.<br />\nWe call for a remodeling of the system at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nWe feel that a large minority, if not a Majority, of the students agree with us in substance.

It may even be that it was the truth in the<br />\ncase of a few of them. But what about the score who never so<br />\nmuch as thought of the \"pressure of studies\"? Is it fair that<br />\nthey, too, should be held up to the scorn and ridicule of their<br />\nclassmates because of this libelous intimation that they have a<br />\nthirst for knowledge?

But is it the most<br />\nenlightening? Resignations are not frequent at a place like<br />\nHopkins, where activities honors are bitterly contested ;\u2014would<br />\nit not be interesting, perhaps valuable, to know the whys and<br />\nwherefores of the infrequent withdrawals?<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nOf course, this matter is itself a comparatively insignificant one.
