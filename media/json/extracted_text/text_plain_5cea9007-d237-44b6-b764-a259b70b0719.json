These areas<br />\nare: 1. Social Sciences 2. Humanities 3. Biological<br />\nSciences 4. Physical Sciences 5. Engineering Sciences<br />\n6. Earth Sciences 7. The Medical School.<br />\nThe problem that faces Hopkins is one of size. In<br />\nthe past we have been able to maintain excellent departments in spite of relatively small size. Today,<br />\nHopkins loses ground to other major universities, to a great extent, on account of inadequate resources<br />\nin both men and facilities. Much of the problem which<br />\nthe Committee describes stems from the necessity to<br />\nincrease size of the departments without injuring<br />\nthe school's academic excellence.<br />\nHUMANITIES, after long neglect, has been given<br />\ntop priority. Consequently much has already been<br />\naccomplished before the Committee's Report was<br />\never completed. Of a recommended 22 new positions,<br />\n21 have already been authorized by President Eisenhower. A new Humanities Center will offer opportunity for faculty to experiment in approaches to<br />\n<br />\nHumanities study, improve interdepartmental programs and attract new students and scholars. A<br />\nthree-year Ph.D. program in the English Department<br />\nis a bold experiment that, if successful, will be<br />\nadopted by other departments.<br />\nSeveral needs in the Humanities school remain to<br />\nbe settled. With increased faculty, the research facilities of the library will need improving. Secondly,<br />\nfinancial assistance for summer and sabbatical study<br />\nshould be provided by the University.<br />\nTHE SOCIAL SCIENCES will require new coordination between departments to offer stimulating<br />\nprograms and more extensive study.<br />\nIncreased staff will be required in all departments,<br />\nespecially Psychology and Social Relations. Eventually, with larger departments, an individual social<br />\nscience building will be required.<br />\nWith Hopkins situated so near to Washington, D.C.,<br />\nan excellent opportunity exists to initiate a \"National<br />\nPolicy Analysis Center\" in that city. This would be<br />\nmade available not only to Hopkins scholars but to<br />\nthe scholars of the nation as well. It would augment<br />\nHopkins' appeal to outstanding scholars.<br />\nThird, Hopkins must expand its areas of concentration. A crucial need is in the History Department<br />\nwhere there is little attention given to non-Western<br />\n<br />\ncivilizations. Oriental, Latin American and African<br />\nstudies are critically needed.<br />\nThe BIOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES have needs which are much in* common. New faculty must be added not only to existing<br />\nfields but in order to introduce new areas. Astrophysics, Particle physics and Geophysics must be included. New Laboratory facilities will consequently<br />\nbe needed.<br />\nTo compete with other leading universities Hopkins must place more emphasis on the theoretical<br />\nand experimental studies. To accomplish this, and because of an inordinate teaching load, thirty new positions must be added to the Physical Sciences faculty<br />\nalone.<br />\nAt the MEDICAL SCHOOL the training of Ph.D.'s<br />\nmust either be limited or better organized. If it is<br />\ndecided to adopt a sizable program then steps must<br />\nbe taken to heighten cooperation between Homewood and the Hospital, in schedules, facilities, and<br />\nadministration.<br />\nPOSTDOCTORAL studies should be given a much<br />\nclearer status within the Hopkins Community. Students doing research as associates, to gain recognition of their residence at Hopkins, should be organized into a society of Fellows, to perhaps do some<br />\nteaching yet lose none of their independence.<br />\n<br />\nitirttrr<br />\nVOL.

He never<br />\nlooks well on television and<br />\nwhatever the merits of his<br />\nspeech, his delivery could be<br />\ncounted on to butcher it. For<br />\nmonths discussion of a \"credibility gap\" had created a skeptical and critical audience. His<br />\nbeloved polls had been sliding for<br />\nsome time.<br />\nHowever, I believe that anyone that refused to endure<br />\nall these discomforts did not<br />\nonly himself but his President a disfavor. Regardless of<br />\nwhat emerges from all the rhetoric (if you will) the State of<br />\nthe Union Address presents a<br />\nvaluable look at the position of<br />\nour President.<br />\nIn our current readiness to<br />\ndebunk Lyndon Johnson, we may<br />\nhastily mistaken a well-intended<br />\ncandor for a lack of oratorical,<br />\nor even linguistic, talent. It<br />\nseems to me that Mr.'Johnson<br />\nspoke directly to each issue mentioned. The speech lacked much<br />\nof the \"apple pie and mother\"<br />\nappeals, that the President is<br />\nusually quick to disgorge when<br />\nacumen and honesty are demanded of him.<br />\nTo espouse a tax hike over national Prime Time, two years,<br />\nafter hailing his tax decrease as<br />\na sign of the good times ahead,<br />\nrequired political gut. More especially since the 6% sur-charge<br />\nwill be addressed specifically to<br />\na policy of his own that has<br />\naroused considerable debate and<br />\npolitical risk.<br />\nSecondly, in his discussion of<br />\nthe Vietnam War. Johnson refrained from depicting the rosy<br />\npicture that he so often invokes<br />\nfor his Great Society. As Eric<br />\nSevareid observed, the President<br />\nwas \"depressing\" on the issue<br />\nof the war. He made it clear<br />\nthat while he was President we<br />\nwould endure in Vietnam even<br />\nthough it could take decades.<br />\nFor Prime Time television this<br />\nis a very courageous statement.<br />\nA less obvious indication of<br />\n<br />\nthe President's candor are the<br />\nnumerous issues which he omitted altogether from the 1967<br />\nversion of the Great Society. To<br />\navoid civil rights, for instance,<br />\nfrom the usual panacea was not<br />\nonly politically dangerous but out<br />\nof character. Similarly, he restrained from promising an antimissile defense system that<br />\nwould of course be superior to<br />\nwhatever the Russians might<br />\nhave. This is the reverse of the<br />\nestablished tendency to offer<br />\nsomething for anybody and anything.<br />\nThe fact that Lyndon Johnson was candid for \"one brief<br />\nshining moment\" how eve r,<br />\nshould not cloud the content of<br />\nthe Address, which was the<br />\nState of the Union. If the man<br />\nwas honest with us he can still<br />\nbe in the'wrong. Three questions<br />\nwhich might arise from the talk<br />\nare basic.<br />\nThe first of these concerns<br />\nJohnson's persistent plea for<br />\npartnership in governmen t.<br />\nWhether this was a pipedream or<br />\na serious conviction, it runs<br />\ncounter to every principle on<br />\nwhich our government has persisted. The strength of federalism is the opposition of interdependent elements. While Congress has never recovered from<br />\nthe executive monolith of Frank-<br />\n<br />\nPAGE THREE<br />\n<br />\nlin Roosevelt's Administration, to<br />\nconceive of total cooperation and<br />\ncentralization in our government,<br />\nas Lyndon very well may, is dangerous.<br />\nConcerning Vietnam, Johnson<br />\nseems confused. The fight<br />\nagainst Communism in the hinterland will be an American responsibility. The erection of a<br />\nstable government in South Vietnam will remain a Vietnamese<br />\nconcern.

Schenck<br />\n<br />\nCoarse Offering<br />\nWith this week's release of the second semester<br />\ncourse schedule, the Hopkins student was once again<br />\nforced to find new, desirable and non-conflicting courses<br />\nin an offering consisting of little originality and poor<br />\nscheduling.<br />\nIt is difficult to blame any one sector of the university for this condition. The Registrar's Office, most<br />\noften the scapegoat, faces a monumental task every<br />\nsemester in scheduling classes of both diverse and correlative natures to the satisfaction of each department,<br />\neach faculty member and each student. The difficulty of<br />\nthe job is compounded when the registrar follows the<br />\ntraditional practice of scheduling low level courses in<br />\nthe morning, labs and electives in the afternoon. The<br />\nRegistrar's Office, responsible to both the faculty's and<br />\nthe students' needs and desires, has limited alternatives in determining the best schedule for each.<br />\nMany faculty members have other obligations than<br />\nteaching at Homewood and because of this can only<br />\nmeet classes one or two days a week. Also, the faculty,<br />\nwith demands and pressures for publishing, must be<br />\nable to choose when they most desire to have classes<br />\nBO their teaching obligations can be met without greatly<br />\ninterfering with their other commitments. Johns Hopkins, established along the lines of the nineteenth century German university, was imbued from the start<br />\nwith the concept of \"lehrfreiheit\"\u2014or academic freedom. Under this system, a professor ideally teaches<br />\nwhat and when he wants, with the assumption that he<br />\nwill be a more effective teacher because he is free to<br />\nsay or do what he pleases. Because this is an ingrained<br />\nbelief at Hopkins-e--and academic freedom has proved<br />\neffective here--there must he no governing power over<br />\nthe faculty dictating what and when it must teach.<br />\nThe students, however, have the explicit right to<br />\ndemand that any wrongs\u2014even if they only seem to<br />\nbe wrong to the students\u2014be examined and rectified if<br />\nthey actually are found to be wrong. This right, \"lehrenfreheit\"\u2014the other half of academic freedom\u2014must<br />\nbe guarded constantly and diligently by the student<br />\nbody, just as the rights of the faculty must be guarded.<br />\nWhere various academic departments at Hopkins<br />\ndeserve the greatest criticism is in their course offerings. The foreign languages, although not a common<br />\nmajor, consistently has a poor and repetitious selection<br />\nof courses beyond the elements. For example, German<br />\noffers one course in literature next semester, while<br />\nFrench has three, only one of which has not been taught<br />\nin the last two years. Political Science, one of the most<br />\npopular majors, offers a mere four courses, as compared to eleven courses offered in that department in<br />\nthe second semester last year. Of all the humanities departments only history has taken an initiative in expanding its program and in starting new courses, notably<br />\n\"The Negro in America\" and \"Germany since 1870.\"<br />\nThe problem of sparse course offerings is due<br />\nsimply to a shortage of professors; an overload of work<br />\nfor any one professor does mere ultimate harm than<br />\ngood for the student.<br />\nConflicts among desired courses are unavoidable to<br />\nsome degree in any large university, but a student<br />\nshould never have to be beset with as many conflicts as<br />\nhas been the case in recent years. It is difficult to find<br />\na solution; perhaps a computer could determine the<br />\nbest of all possible combinations, that which is most<br />\nserviceable to both students and faculty. Perhaps a<br />\nchange in the weekly schedule with more two-hour<br />\ncourses in the 300 level and one-hour-and-fifteen minute courses twice a week in the lower level. If rooms are<br />\navailable, some higher level courses could meet in the<br />\nevening.<br />\n<br />\nBefore any reforms in the system can he made,<br />\nit is up to the Registrar's Office to find out exactly how<br />\nmany students have been affected and to what extent<br />\nconflicts have arisen. The Registrar's Office, as the organizing body in the University, must take a more active<br />\npart in finding where the problems lie and then in<br />\nameliorating them.<br />\n<br />\nExtravagant Praise Dept.<br />\nHurray for the News-Letter that inspired the Reinsch<br />\nwho prodded the Council that frightened the Faculty who<br />\npushed the Administration to junk the house that Vayne<br />\nbuilt.<br />\nJust under a year ago the News-Letter inaugurated<br />\nthe campaign to reform the Bookstore. Its resolution is<br />\na fair one, the bookstore will now be faculty controled<br />\nand students will receive 10% discounts on all but<br />\nformal textbooks.<br />\nIncidental apologies are due Mr. Vayne who served<br />\nas everybody's whipping boy during the high days of<br />\nthe crisis.

Synagogues still exist,<br />\nbut the Jews are discpuraged<br />\nfrom going. No new prayer books<br />\ncan be published, as is permitted<br />\nto the Christian churches. But<br />\nnevertheless, there is life. In<br />\ntheir passports, they have to<br />\nhave a stamp indicating their<br />\nreligion; they cannot teach the<br />\nhistory of their faith in the<br />\nlanguage of their past; and they<br />\npersist.

He was there<br />\nat the time of the high holidays.<br />\nand, in opposition to the wishes<br />\nof the authorities, he found the<br />\nsynagogues packed. But the men<br />\nrefused to speak with him at<br />\nfirst. They were afraid of associating with the foreigner. It<br />\nwas only when he, too, started<br />\nto pray, aloud, with the devotion<br />\nand the abandonment to his<br />\n<br />\nspirit which he had learned as a<br />\nboy in Hungary, before the war,<br />\nthat they accepted him. ,They<br />\nfelt that this was not a mere<br />\nobserver.

What kind of man makes a<br />\nMan of the Year? To determine the answer to this<br />\ndifficult and highly complex question, the editors of<br />\nT*ME took many factors into account. The Man of<br />\nthe Year would, of course, have to be representative<br />\nof the new America, the vibrant young America of<br />\n1966. He would have to be a man much in the news,<br />\nmuch with the news\u2014a man who makes the news<br />\nwhile others sit around and wait for news to happen.<br />\nWe wanted, also, the man who has sold the most<br />\nnews, and it was a matter of simple statistics to see<br />\nwho that would be. But there's more to a Man of the<br />\nYear. He has to be the kind of man who has made<br />\n1966 what it was, distinct, different, exciting to be<br />\nalive in. Who could that be?<br />\n.0%1. t<br />\n<br />\n4C \u2022<br />\n<br />\n1;4\"<br />\n<br />\nWell, it wasn't long before the editors saw what<br />\nwas probably plain to all of you out there from the<br />\nbeginning\u2014that is, the Man of the Year for 1966 obviously has to be one of this year's famous mass murderers. It's easy to see why. 1966 was the year of the<br />\nmass murder; it was defined, in fact, by mass murder,<br />\nand its counterpart, the Mass Murder Article in T*ME.<br />\nYes, a mass murderer it had to be, but which one?<br />\nWe must admit, after long deliberation on the<br />\nmatter, that the editors cannot decide which of these<br />\nMen stands out above the rest, and we certainly do<br />\nnot wish to anger any of these men by not awarding<br />\nhim the title\u2014which is not hard to understand. Therefore, the editors have decided to place the decision<br />\nup to the judgment of the readers of T*ME Magazine,<br />\nwho, in the end, must make each and every man of<br />\nthe year, every year. So it's your ball game, our<br />\nfriend! Below we have printed a ballot for your use.<br />\nPlease fill in the name of the mass murderer you prefer and mail it in to us here at T*ME. We will tabulate<br />\nthe votes, and the winner will receive, the title of<br />\nMan of the Year. Please take into account, as you<br />\nvote, that mass murderer whose crime most interested you, either because of its peculiar flair, or possibly because of the large number of victims, or for<br />\nany aspect of his character. Naturally, a good gauge<br />\nof the mass murderer most interesting to you is the<br />\nnumber of times you read our article on him when<br />\nhe was most in the news, but just in case you've for-gotten one or more of this year's crimes, we include,<br />\nbelow, a short recap of each candidate's career.<br />\nPlease vote!

Lyndon Baines Johnson of Johnson City,<br />\nTexas graduated from his humble origins of torturing<br />\nhalf caste Indians (\"I reckon honey child the only<br />\ngood Injun is a dead one.\") to the American Presidency where he killed John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey<br />\nOswald, Jack Ruby and thirteen other people whose<br />\nnames have been withheld by request. Johnson, an<br />\neasy going ex-school teacher whose hobby is bombing defenseless people, culminated a remarkable five<br />\nyears when on December 25 he told Jack Ruby to<br />\nsuddenly die of cancer.<br />\n<br />\nRobert Benjamin Smith<br />\nCHARLES WHITMAN<br />\n<br />\nRICHARD SPECIE<br />\n<br />\nThe Cincinnati Strangler<br />\n<br />\nCHARLES WHITMAN<br />\nCharles Whitman, a brilliant scientist doing research at the University of Texas, in Texas, last<br />\nAugust (or September) terrorized the University<br />\ncampus with a rifle. He stationed himself atop a<br />\ntower overlooking the campus and shot, sniper-style,<br />\ndown on passers-by. Later, when University officials<br />\nand others realized what Whitman was doing, they<br />\nadvised anyone using that portion of the college<br />\ngrounds to \"watch his (or her) step.\" Nevertheless,<br />\nWhitman managed to kill almost twenty in his spree<br />\nof terror, keeping police ducking for cover with his<br />\nshots and running from one part of the tower to<br />\nanother repeatedly, in a manner described by one<br />\nobserver as, \"the way a crazy man would run around.<br />\nLike a crazy person.\" But crazy or not, there is little<br />\ndoubt that Whitman was as effective a marksman as<br />\nhas been seen in this country since the days of Buffalo<br />\nBill Cody and Kit Carson.

Nevertheless, Chicago is ably represented by<br />\nRichard Speck, alleged killer-rapist-botherer of eight<br />\nstudent nurses in a dormitory in Chicago. According<br />\nto the statements of a ninth girl, who escaped his<br />\nwrath (she denied the use of bribery when questioned<br />\nby T*ME), Speck burst in upon the reposing lovelies<br />\none evening \"out of nowhere, through the door,\" and<br />\nproceded to completely bother them,'after which he<br />\nmurdered them.<br />\nPolice arriving at the scene found the girls' room<br />\nFt shamble, the sheets bloody and dragging on the<br />\nfloor, blood covering the floor and walls and windows<br />\nand door and chairs and desk and ceiling. One of the<br />\ngirls was apparently in the middle of a novel when<br />\nthe attack occurred, and it was lying open on the<br />\nfloor, pages 218-219 completely soaked with blood.<br />\nThe lone survivor, said Chicago precinct Captain<br />\nChuck Whitman, \"was all covered with like a lot of<br />\nblood.\" He told T*ME reporters that the police were<br />\n<br />\nBobby Smith was always an impressionable boy,<br />\nand murder impressed him most. \"The only good<br />\ninjun is a dead one,\" said Bobby to a T*ME staff<br />\nreporter while sipping a black and white soda. This<br />\nquiet ambitious high school student had a plan, and<br />\none dry, dusty day in Mesa, Arizona last August he<br />\ncarried it out.<br />\nEarly one morning he set out from home carrying<br />\na small attache case filled with two dozen baggies, a<br />\nblue shower cap, three thousand feet of 50 lb.-test<br />\nnylon cord, and assorted firearms. He was heading<br />\nfor the Rose-Mar College of Beauty.<br />\nHe entered the shop and gained everyone's attention by firing a pistol. He then explained to the five<br />\nwomen and two children present that he was about<br />\nto smother them. Laying down his pistol on a formica<br />\ncounter that had been installed the previous day, he<br />\npulled from his attache case an unopened box of<br />\nbaggies. To his distress, he discovered that the baggies were too small to fit over the heads of the<br />\nwomen. Without delay, he replaced the baggies in the<br />\ncase and ordered the women and children to lie in a<br />\ncircle on the floor. \"Like the spokes of a wheel,\"<br />\nBobby later explained to disgusted policemen. When<br />\nthey had ararnged themselves properly on the floor,<br />\nBobby walked around the circle firing his gun. \"It<br />\nwas easier than shooting pipes in a carnival,\" he later<br />\nstated to interested reporters.<br />\n<br />\nROBERT BENJAMIN SMITH<br />\n<br />\nBALLOT<br />\nT*ME MAN OF THE YEAR<br />\nC/O THE NEWS-Lk:C.1'ER<br />\nBOX 1230 J.H.U.<br />\n<br />\nCHARLES WHITMAN<br />\nRICHARD SPECK<br />\nLYNDON BAINES JOHNSON<br />\n<br />\nEl<br />\n<br />\nROBERT BENJAMIN SMITH<br />\nTHE CINCINNATI STRANGLER 0<br />\nTHE CINCINNATI STRANGLER<br />\n<br />\nPLEASE VOTE!<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS -LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE SIX<br />\n<br />\nB.

Back to the history of Puerto Rico. The<br />\nIsland was discovered by that popular discoverer Christopher Columbus. Incidentally, considering Columbus'<br />\npopularity, it's odd we know so little about him. What do<br />\nwe really know? Only this:<br />\nHe was born in Genoa on August 25 1451, the son of<br />\nRalph T. Columbus, a knee-cymbal vendor, and Eleanor<br />\n(Swifty) Columbus, a low hurdler. He was an only child<br />\nexcept for his five brothers and eight sisters. From early<br />\nchildhood he was an avid reader and spent all his waking<br />\nhours immersed in a book. Unfortunately,there was only<br />\none book in Genoa at the time\u2014Care of the Horse by<br />\nAristotle\u2014and after 18 years of reading Care of the<br />\nHorse, Columbus grew restless. When rumor reached<br />\nhim there was another book in Madrid, off he ran as fast<br />\nas his little fat legs would carry him.<br />\nDisappointment,alas,awaited him there.The only book<br />\nIn Madrid was Guider un Cabello,which proved to be nothing more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.<br />\nThen one day Columbus heard from a traveller that<br />\nthere were millions of books in India, and he was instantly ablaze to set sail. Off he ran on his little fat legs<br />\nto the court of Ferdinand and Isabella (Columbus,though<br />\nmore than six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs<br />\nall his life) and, as we all know, he persuaded the Spanish rulers to outfit him with three stout ships,the Popsy,<br />\nthe Mopsy, and the Cottontail, and the rest is history!<br />\n<br />\nAN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER<br />\n<br />\nNEWMAN HOUSE<br />\nThe Catholic Center for Johns Hopkins<br />\nBE 5-9271<br />\n2941 N.

These areas<br />\nare: 1. Social Sciences 2. Humanities 3. Biological<br />\nSciences 4. Physical Sciences 5. Engineering Sciences<br />\n6. Earth Sciences 7. The Medical School.<br />\nThe problem that faces Hopkins is one of size. In<br />\nthe past we have been able to maintain excellent departments in spite of relatively small size. Today,<br />\nHopkins loses ground to other major universities, to a great extent, on account of inadequate resources<br />\nin both men and facilities. Much of the problem which<br />\nthe Committee describes stems from the necessity to<br />\nincrease size of the departments without injuring<br />\nthe school's academic excellence.<br />\nHUMANITIES, after long neglect, has been given<br />\ntop priority. Consequently much has already been<br />\naccomplished before the Committee's Report was<br />\never completed. Of a recommended 22 new positions,<br />\n21 have already been authorized by President Eisenhower. A new Humanities Center will offer opportunity for faculty to experiment in approaches to<br /><br />\nHumanities study, improve interdepartmental programs and attract new students and scholars. A<br />\nthree-year Ph.D. program in the English Department<br />\nis a bold experiment that, if successful, will be<br />\nadopted by other departments.<br />\nSeveral needs in the Humanities school remain to<br />\nbe settled. With increased faculty, the research facilities of the library will need improving. Secondly,<br />\nfinancial assistance for summer and sabbatical study<br />\nshould be provided by the University.<br />\nTHE SOCIAL SCIENCES will require new coordination between departments to offer stimulating<br />\nprograms and more extensive study.<br />\nIncreased staff will be required in all departments,<br />\nespecially Psychology and Social Relations. Eventually, with larger departments, an individual social<br />\nscience building will be required.<br />\nWith Hopkins situated so near to Washington, D.C.,<br />\nan excellent opportunity exists to initiate a \"National<br />\nPolicy Analysis Center\" in that city. This would be<br />\nmade available not only to Hopkins scholars but to<br />\nthe scholars of the nation as well. It would augment<br />\nHopkins' appeal to outstanding scholars.<br />\nThird, Hopkins must expand its areas of concentration. A crucial need is in the History Department<br />\nwhere there is little attention given to non-Western<br /><br />\ncivilizations. Oriental, Latin American and African<br />\nstudies are critically needed.<br />\nThe BIOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES have needs which are much in* common. New faculty must be added not only to existing<br />\nfields but in order to introduce new areas. Astrophysics, Particle physics and Geophysics must be included. New Laboratory facilities will consequently<br />\nbe needed.<br />\nTo compete with other leading universities Hopkins must place more emphasis on the theoretical<br />\nand experimental studies. To accomplish this, and because of an inordinate teaching load, thirty new positions must be added to the Physical Sciences faculty<br />\nalone.<br />\nAt the MEDICAL SCHOOL the training of Ph.D.'s<br />\nmust either be limited or better organized. If it is<br />\ndecided to adopt a sizable program then steps must<br />\nbe taken to heighten cooperation between Homewood and the Hospital, in schedules, facilities, and<br />\nadministration.<br />\nPOSTDOCTORAL studies should be given a much<br />\nclearer status within the Hopkins Community. Students doing research as associates, to gain recognition of their residence at Hopkins, should be organized into a society of Fellows, to perhaps do some<br />\nteaching yet lose none of their independence.<br /><br />\nitirttrr<br />\nVOL.

He never<br />\nlooks well on television and<br />\nwhatever the merits of his<br />\nspeech, his delivery could be<br />\ncounted on to butcher it. For<br />\nmonths discussion of a \"credibility gap\" had created a skeptical and critical audience. His<br />\nbeloved polls had been sliding for<br />\nsome time.<br />\nHowever, I believe that anyone that refused to endure<br />\nall these discomforts did not<br />\nonly himself but his President a disfavor. Regardless of<br />\nwhat emerges from all the rhetoric (if you will) the State of<br />\nthe Union Address presents a<br />\nvaluable look at the position of<br />\nour President.<br />\nIn our current readiness to<br />\ndebunk Lyndon Johnson, we may<br />\nhastily mistaken a well-intended<br />\ncandor for a lack of oratorical,<br />\nor even linguistic, talent. It<br />\nseems to me that Mr.'Johnson<br />\nspoke directly to each issue mentioned. The speech lacked much<br />\nof the \"apple pie and mother\"<br />\nappeals, that the President is<br />\nusually quick to disgorge when<br />\nacumen and honesty are demanded of him.<br />\nTo espouse a tax hike over national Prime Time, two years,<br />\nafter hailing his tax decrease as<br />\na sign of the good times ahead,<br />\nrequired political gut. More especially since the 6% sur-charge<br />\nwill be addressed specifically to<br />\na policy of his own that has<br />\naroused considerable debate and<br />\npolitical risk.<br />\nSecondly, in his discussion of<br />\nthe Vietnam War. Johnson refrained from depicting the rosy<br />\npicture that he so often invokes<br />\nfor his Great Society. As Eric<br />\nSevareid observed, the President<br />\nwas \"depressing\" on the issue<br />\nof the war. He made it clear<br />\nthat while he was President we<br />\nwould endure in Vietnam even<br />\nthough it could take decades.<br />\nFor Prime Time television this<br />\nis a very courageous statement.<br />\nA less obvious indication of<br /><br />\nthe President's candor are the<br />\nnumerous issues which he omitted altogether from the 1967<br />\nversion of the Great Society. To<br />\navoid civil rights, for instance,<br />\nfrom the usual panacea was not<br />\nonly politically dangerous but out<br />\nof character. Similarly, he restrained from promising an antimissile defense system that<br />\nwould of course be superior to<br />\nwhatever the Russians might<br />\nhave. This is the reverse of the<br />\nestablished tendency to offer<br />\nsomething for anybody and anything.<br />\nThe fact that Lyndon Johnson was candid for \"one brief<br />\nshining moment\" how eve r,<br />\nshould not cloud the content of<br />\nthe Address, which was the<br />\nState of the Union. If the man<br />\nwas honest with us he can still<br />\nbe in the'wrong. Three questions<br />\nwhich might arise from the talk<br />\nare basic.<br />\nThe first of these concerns<br />\nJohnson's persistent plea for<br />\npartnership in governmen t.<br />\nWhether this was a pipedream or<br />\na serious conviction, it runs<br />\ncounter to every principle on<br />\nwhich our government has persisted. The strength of federalism is the opposition of interdependent elements. While Congress has never recovered from<br />\nthe executive monolith of Frank-<br /><br />\nPAGE THREE<br /><br />\nlin Roosevelt's Administration, to<br />\nconceive of total cooperation and<br />\ncentralization in our government,<br />\nas Lyndon very well may, is dangerous.<br />\nConcerning Vietnam, Johnson<br />\nseems confused. The fight<br />\nagainst Communism in the hinterland will be an American responsibility. The erection of a<br />\nstable government in South Vietnam will remain a Vietnamese<br />\nconcern. Judging from our record<br />\nof success in either attempt and<br />\nfrom the original objectives with<br />\nwhich Mr. Dulles embroiled us in<br />\nthe war, the President might<br />\nhave confused not only the<br />\nAmerican role but the necessary<br />\npriorities.<br />\nDespite the Immediate issues<br />\nthat will be faced in the next<br />\ntwo years, President Johnson's<br />\naddress affords comfortable relief<br />\nwhen it is remembered that just<br />\nten years ago the President of<br />\nthe United States was espousing<br />\n\"massive retailiation\" against<br />\nCommunist aggression, \"tactical\"<br />\nnuclear bombing for the security<br />\nof Formosa and the \"encirclement\" of Soviet Russia. If Lyndon Johnson is at times befuddled by criticism and over-anxious to implement his sincere<br />\nconvictions, it is not necessarily<br />\nimplied that he is intentionally<br />\ndeceptive.<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\nis practicable, without either<br />\nhidden subsidies being paid by<br />\nthe University or hidden profits accruing to the University?'<br />\n\"This problem stems from the<br />\nCouncil's statement that the<br />\nUniversity was using bookstore<br />\nprofits to subsidize less profitable undertakings.

Schenck<br /><br />\nCoarse Offering<br />\nWith this week's release of the second semester<br />\ncourse schedule, the Hopkins student was once again<br />\nforced to find new, desirable and non-conflicting courses<br />\nin an offering consisting of little originality and poor<br />\nscheduling.<br />\nIt is difficult to blame any one sector of the university for this condition. The Registrar's Office, most<br />\noften the scapegoat, faces a monumental task every<br />\nsemester in scheduling classes of both diverse and correlative natures to the satisfaction of each department,<br />\neach faculty member and each student. The difficulty of<br />\nthe job is compounded when the registrar follows the<br />\ntraditional practice of scheduling low level courses in<br />\nthe morning, labs and electives in the afternoon. The<br />\nRegistrar's Office, responsible to both the faculty's and<br />\nthe students' needs and desires, has limited alternatives in determining the best schedule for each.<br />\nMany faculty members have other obligations than<br />\nteaching at Homewood and because of this can only<br />\nmeet classes one or two days a week. Also, the faculty,<br />\nwith demands and pressures for publishing, must be<br />\nable to choose when they most desire to have classes<br />\nBO their teaching obligations can be met without greatly<br />\ninterfering with their other commitments. Johns Hopkins, established along the lines of the nineteenth century German university, was imbued from the start<br />\nwith the concept of \"lehrfreiheit\"\u2014or academic freedom. Under this system, a professor ideally teaches<br />\nwhat and when he wants, with the assumption that he<br />\nwill be a more effective teacher because he is free to<br />\nsay or do what he pleases. Because this is an ingrained<br />\nbelief at Hopkins-e--and academic freedom has proved<br />\neffective here--there must he no governing power over<br />\nthe faculty dictating what and when it must teach.<br />\nThe students, however, have the explicit right to<br />\ndemand that any wrongs\u2014even if they only seem to<br />\nbe wrong to the students\u2014be examined and rectified if<br />\nthey actually are found to be wrong. This right, \"lehrenfreheit\"\u2014the other half of academic freedom\u2014must<br />\nbe guarded constantly and diligently by the student<br />\nbody, just as the rights of the faculty must be guarded.<br />\nWhere various academic departments at Hopkins<br />\ndeserve the greatest criticism is in their course offerings. The foreign languages, although not a common<br />\nmajor, consistently has a poor and repetitious selection<br />\nof courses beyond the elements. For example, German<br />\noffers one course in literature next semester, while<br />\nFrench has three, only one of which has not been taught<br />\nin the last two years. Political Science, one of the most<br />\npopular majors, offers a mere four courses, as compared to eleven courses offered in that department in<br />\nthe second semester last year. Of all the humanities departments only history has taken an initiative in expanding its program and in starting new courses, notably<br />\n\"The Negro in America\" and \"Germany since 1870.\"<br />\nThe problem of sparse course offerings is due<br />\nsimply to a shortage of professors; an overload of work<br />\nfor any one professor does mere ultimate harm than<br />\ngood for the student.<br />\nConflicts among desired courses are unavoidable to<br />\nsome degree in any large university, but a student<br />\nshould never have to be beset with as many conflicts as<br />\nhas been the case in recent years. It is difficult to find<br />\na solution; perhaps a computer could determine the<br />\nbest of all possible combinations, that which is most<br />\nserviceable to both students and faculty. Perhaps a<br />\nchange in the weekly schedule with more two-hour<br />\ncourses in the 300 level and one-hour-and-fifteen minute courses twice a week in the lower level. If rooms are<br />\navailable, some higher level courses could meet in the<br />\nevening.<br /><br />\nBefore any reforms in the system can he made,<br />\nit is up to the Registrar's Office to find out exactly how<br />\nmany students have been affected and to what extent<br />\nconflicts have arisen. The Registrar's Office, as the organizing body in the University, must take a more active<br />\npart in finding where the problems lie and then in<br />\nameliorating them.<br /><br />\nExtravagant Praise Dept.<br />\nHurray for the News-Letter that inspired the Reinsch<br />\nwho prodded the Council that frightened the Faculty who<br />\npushed the Administration to junk the house that Vayne<br />\nbuilt.<br />\nJust under a year ago the News-Letter inaugurated<br />\nthe campaign to reform the Bookstore.

Their eyes.

Mostly,<br />\nhe searched for them in the<br />\nplaces of worship. He was there<br />\nat the time of the high holidays.<br />\nand, in opposition to the wishes<br />\nof the authorities, he found the<br />\nsynagogues packed. But the men<br />\nrefused to speak with him at<br />\nfirst. They were afraid of associating with the foreigner. It<br />\nwas only when he, too, started<br />\nto pray, aloud, with the devotion<br />\nand the abandonment to his<br /><br />\nspirit which he had learned as a<br />\nboy in Hungary, before the war,<br />\nthat they accepted him. ,They<br />\nfelt that this was not a mere<br />\nobserver. Here, among them, sat<br />\none who could understand.<br />\nAnd they unburdened themselves to him. In a sukka, the<br />\nhut in which the Feast of Tabernacles is celebrated, he heard<br />\ntheir sobs, disguised as song;<br />\nabove all, they wanted him to<br />\ntell their brethren in the other<br />\nworld that they fulfilled the<br />\ncommandment of joy. A captain<br />\nof the Red Army showed him his<br />\nson as he pointed at a crowd<br />\nof young people who were singing Hebrew melodies on the<br />\nnight of Simchat Tora, the Rejoycing of the Tara, minutes<br />\naway from the Kremlin: \"He's<br />\nhere somewhere. Look closely,<br />\nthey are all my son.\"<br />\nThe time came when the author had to return. \"I believe<br />\nwith all my soul,\" he writes at<br />\nthe end of the magnificent volume, \"that despite the suffering,<br />\ndespite the hardship and the<br />\nfear, the Jews of Russia will<br />\nwithstand the pressure and remain victorious.

What kind of man makes a<br />\nMan of the Year? To determine the answer to this<br />\ndifficult and highly complex question, the editors of<br />\nT*ME took many factors into account. The Man of<br />\nthe Year would, of course, have to be representative<br />\nof the new America, the vibrant young America of<br />\n1966. He would have to be a man much in the news,<br />\nmuch with the news\u2014a man who makes the news<br />\nwhile others sit around and wait for news to happen.<br />\nWe wanted, also, the man who has sold the most<br />\nnews, and it was a matter of simple statistics to see<br />\nwho that would be. But there's more to a Man of the<br />\nYear. He has to be the kind of man who has made<br />\n1966 what it was, distinct, different, exciting to be<br />\nalive in. Who could that be?<br />\n.0%1. t<br /><br />\n4C \u2022<br /><br />\n1;4\"<br /><br />\nWell, it wasn't long before the editors saw what<br />\nwas probably plain to all of you out there from the<br />\nbeginning\u2014that is, the Man of the Year for 1966 obviously has to be one of this year's famous mass murderers. It's easy to see why. 1966 was the year of the<br />\nmass murder; it was defined, in fact, by mass murder,<br />\nand its counterpart, the Mass Murder Article in T*ME.<br />\nYes, a mass murderer it had to be, but which one?<br />\nWe must admit, after long deliberation on the<br />\nmatter, that the editors cannot decide which of these<br />\nMen stands out above the rest, and we certainly do<br />\nnot wish to anger any of these men by not awarding<br />\nhim the title\u2014which is not hard to understand. Therefore, the editors have decided to place the decision<br />\nup to the judgment of the readers of T*ME Magazine,<br />\nwho, in the end, must make each and every man of<br />\nthe year, every year. So it's your ball game, our<br />\nfriend! Below we have printed a ballot for your use.<br />\nPlease fill in the name of the mass murderer you prefer and mail it in to us here at T*ME. We will tabulate<br />\nthe votes, and the winner will receive, the title of<br />\nMan of the Year. Please take into account, as you<br />\nvote, that mass murderer whose crime most interested you, either because of its peculiar flair, or possibly because of the large number of victims, or for<br />\nany aspect of his character. Naturally, a good gauge<br />\nof the mass murderer most interesting to you is the<br />\nnumber of times you read our article on him when<br />\nhe was most in the news, but just in case you've for-gotten one or more of this year's crimes, we include,<br />\nbelow, a short recap of each candidate's career.<br />\nPlease vote!

Lyndon Baines Johnson of Johnson City,<br />\nTexas graduated from his humble origins of torturing<br />\nhalf caste Indians (\"I reckon honey child the only<br />\ngood Injun is a dead one.\") to the American Presidency where he killed John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey<br />\nOswald, Jack Ruby and thirteen other people whose<br />\nnames have been withheld by request. Johnson, an<br />\neasy going ex-school teacher whose hobby is bombing defenseless people, culminated a remarkable five<br />\nyears when on December 25 he told Jack Ruby to<br />\nsuddenly die of cancer.<br /><br />\nRobert Benjamin Smith<br />\nCHARLES WHITMAN<br /><br />\nRICHARD SPECIE<br /><br />\nThe Cincinnati Strangler<br /><br />\nCHARLES WHITMAN<br />\nCharles Whitman, a brilliant scientist doing research at the University of Texas, in Texas, last<br />\nAugust (or September) terrorized the University<br />\ncampus with a rifle. He stationed himself atop a<br />\ntower overlooking the campus and shot, sniper-style,<br />\ndown on passers-by. Later, when University officials<br />\nand others realized what Whitman was doing, they<br />\nadvised anyone using that portion of the college<br />\ngrounds to \"watch his (or her) step.\" Nevertheless,<br />\nWhitman managed to kill almost twenty in his spree<br />\nof terror, keeping police ducking for cover with his<br />\nshots and running from one part of the tower to<br />\nanother repeatedly, in a manner described by one<br />\nobserver as, \"the way a crazy man would run around.<br />\nLike a crazy person.\" But crazy or not, there is little<br />\ndoubt that Whitman was as effective a marksman as<br />\nhas been seen in this country since the days of Buffalo<br />\nBill Cody and Kit Carson. Experts agree that in this<br />\nage of soft, flabby Americans, riflery is fast becoming<br />\na lost art, and that there are few others in this nation<br />\nwho could have sustained the accuracy displayed by<br />\nWhitman on that day for more than a few shots.<br /><br />\nLYNDON BAINES JOHNSON<br /><br />\nDr. Hochhausler, famed surgeon and bereaved husband, stepped up to his blue Triumph sports car<br />\nlast October, only to discover his wife, Alice, who<br />\nhad spent much of her time nursing a flower garden in<br />\ntheir spacious backyard in the suburb of Clifton,<br />\nsprawled obscenely in the front seat. She was wearing a red robe. The cord of the robe has been cited<br />\nas the murder weapon.\"We found this red terrycloth<br />\ncord around her throat,\" related a Cincinnati police<br />\nofficer, \"and we suspect that it may be the belt to her<br />\nrobe, which is made of the same material and is the<br />\nsame color.\"<br />\nWhen Mrs. Hochhausler left her new, nine-seater<br />\nstation wagon, she was clubbed from behind, causing<br />\nher dental plates to fall from her mouth. The unfortunate woman was then dragged to the garage<br />\nwhere she was raped and placed in the blue Triumph<br />\nsports car.<br />\nMrs. Hochhausler is not alone. Three other middleage Cincinnati women were strangled during 1966,<br />\nand the Cincinnati Strangler is expected to best himself during 1967.<br /><br />\nPlease Vote<br />\nThere you have it!

Nevertheless, Chicago is ably represented by<br />\nRichard Speck, alleged killer-rapist-botherer of eight<br />\nstudent nurses in a dormitory in Chicago. According<br />\nto the statements of a ninth girl, who escaped his<br />\nwrath (she denied the use of bribery when questioned<br />\nby T*ME), Speck burst in upon the reposing lovelies<br />\none evening \"out of nowhere, through the door,\" and<br />\nproceded to completely bother them,'after which he<br />\nmurdered them.<br />\nPolice arriving at the scene found the girls' room<br />\nFt shamble, the sheets bloody and dragging on the<br />\nfloor, blood covering the floor and walls and windows<br />\nand door and chairs and desk and ceiling. One of the<br />\ngirls was apparently in the middle of a novel when<br />\nthe attack occurred, and it was lying open on the<br />\nfloor, pages 218-219 completely soaked with blood.<br />\nThe lone survivor, said Chicago precinct Captain<br />\nChuck Whitman, \"was all covered with like a lot of<br />\nblood.\" He told T*ME reporters that the police were<br /><br />\nBobby Smith was always an impressionable boy,<br />\nand murder impressed him most. \"The only good<br />\ninjun is a dead one,\" said Bobby to a T*ME staff<br />\nreporter while sipping a black and white soda. This<br />\nquiet ambitious high school student had a plan, and<br />\none dry, dusty day in Mesa, Arizona last August he<br />\ncarried it out.<br />\nEarly one morning he set out from home carrying<br />\na small attache case filled with two dozen baggies, a<br />\nblue shower cap, three thousand feet of 50 lb.-test<br />\nnylon cord, and assorted firearms. He was heading<br />\nfor the Rose-Mar College of Beauty.<br />\nHe entered the shop and gained everyone's attention by firing a pistol. He then explained to the five<br />\nwomen and two children present that he was about<br />\nto smother them. Laying down his pistol on a formica<br />\ncounter that had been installed the previous day, he<br />\npulled from his attache case an unopened box of<br />\nbaggies. To his distress, he discovered that the baggies were too small to fit over the heads of the<br />\nwomen. Without delay, he replaced the baggies in the<br />\ncase and ordered the women and children to lie in a<br />\ncircle on the floor. \"Like the spokes of a wheel,\"<br />\nBobby later explained to disgusted policemen. When<br />\nthey had ararnged themselves properly on the floor,<br />\nBobby walked around the circle firing his gun. \"It<br />\nwas easier than shooting pipes in a carnival,\" he later<br />\nstated to interested reporters.<br /><br />\nROBERT BENJAMIN SMITH<br /><br />\nBALLOT<br />\nT*ME MAN OF THE YEAR<br />\nC/O THE NEWS-Lk:C.1'ER<br />\nBOX 1230 J.H.U.<br /><br />\nCHARLES WHITMAN<br />\nRICHARD SPECK<br />\nLYNDON BAINES JOHNSON<br /><br />\nEl<br /><br />\nROBERT BENJAMIN SMITH<br />\nTHE CINCINNATI STRANGLER 0<br />\nTHE CINCINNATI STRANGLER<br /><br />\nPLEASE VOTE!<br />\n4<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE SIX<br /><br />\nB.

Back to the history of Puerto Rico. The<br />\nIsland was discovered by that popular discoverer Christopher Columbus. Incidentally, considering Columbus'<br />\npopularity, it's odd we know so little about him. What do<br />\nwe really know? Only this:<br />\nHe was born in Genoa on August 25 1451, the son of<br />\nRalph T. Columbus, a knee-cymbal vendor, and Eleanor<br />\n(Swifty) Columbus, a low hurdler. He was an only child<br />\nexcept for his five brothers and eight sisters. From early<br />\nchildhood he was an avid reader and spent all his waking<br />\nhours immersed in a book. Unfortunately,there was only<br />\none book in Genoa at the time\u2014Care of the Horse by<br />\nAristotle\u2014and after 18 years of reading Care of the<br />\nHorse, Columbus grew restless. When rumor reached<br />\nhim there was another book in Madrid, off he ran as fast<br />\nas his little fat legs would carry him.<br />\nDisappointment,alas,awaited him there.The only book<br />\nIn Madrid was Guider un Cabello,which proved to be nothing more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.<br />\nThen one day Columbus heard from a traveller that<br />\nthere were millions of books in India, and he was instantly ablaze to set sail. Off he ran on his little fat legs<br />\nto the court of Ferdinand and Isabella (Columbus,though<br />\nmore than six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs<br />\nall his life) and, as we all know, he persuaded the Spanish rulers to outfit him with three stout ships,the Popsy,<br />\nthe Mopsy, and the Cottontail, and the rest is history!<br /><br />\nAN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER<br /><br />\nNEWMAN HOUSE<br />\nThe Catholic Center for Johns Hopkins<br />\nBE 5-9271<br />\n2941 N.
