Though events of'nonathletic importance spot the campus calendar, there is only one athletic contests to arouse the interest of the students. As a result, athletic enthusiasm has died down and perforce our sporting blood has<br />\ncooled to a degree of abnormality.<br />\nTrue, the lull during the \"non-athletic\" season is not of our own<br />\nchoosing. If conditions, financial and otherwise, are such that minor<br />\nmid-winter sports must be dispensed with, we can only suffer the consequences. Still the fact remains, our athletic interests at the present<br />\ntime are dormant.<br />\nThe annual Hopkins-Fifth Regiment Indoor Games, the highwater mark of the Hopkins mid-winter season, are scheduled for<br />\nFebruary 23. Never before in the history of indoor track has the<br />\nBaltimore public or Johns Hopkins had the opportunity of seeing<br />\nsuch a collection of world-famed stars, runners such as Nurmi, Ritola, Ray, Booth, Clark, Murchison and others. Other colleges and<br />\nsport fans are looking forward with interest to this athletic feature.<br />\nMany students elsewhere are known to be \"hocking\" their watches in<br />\norder to procure the necessary means to attend such a stellar meet.<br />\nStill the Hopkins campus continues to go on in the same smooth<br />\neasy going trend, with an air of indifference toward the indoor meet.<br />\nThe question, are our sporting interests asleep, answers itself in the<br />\naffirmative.<br />\nWhatever the cause of this apparent lack of interest, whether or<br />\nnot it is a result of the absence of minor sports, it is a condition which<br />\nshould be curbed, lest the students sleep through the meet on February 23. Obviously, the solution of the problem should be left in<br />\nthe hands of the Athletic Association. Perhaps that group could<br />\nawaken interest by bringing the importance of the meet to the students' attention at the weekly Assemblies. Perhaps a student section at the Armory might be reserved with tickets at a slightly reduced price. Any method of arousing interest will insure greater attendance and add to the success of the meet.<br />\n<br />\n, member of the Class of 1926, was dismissed from<br />\nMr.<br />\nthe School of Engineering upon recommendation of the Student<br />\n's conduct was of a nature unbecoming to a<br />\nCouncil that Mr.<br />\ngentleman.<br />\n<br />\nFollowing one of the longest<br />\nsieges of wintry weather that has<br />\never transformed this \"Dixieland\"<br />\ncampus into that of a more northern clime, spring-like warmth,<br />\nborne on the crest of a gentle south<br />\nwind, served Thursday and Friday<br />\nto dissipate wintry omens and lend<br />\na faint verdure to the ground so<br />\nlong snow covered. It did more<br />\nthan that, however. It permeated<br />\nthe campus with an air of awakening, which was manifested in the<br />\nundergraduates, just emerging from<br />\nthe inevitable stupor caused by unaccustomed concentration.<br />\nOut behind the engineering buildings a group of students engaged in<br />\na baseball match, and down in front<br />\nof the Barn Store, such a display<br />\nof ties were arrayed that smoked<br />\nglasses, many of them bought for<br />\nthe recent eclipse,, were suggested<br />\nas the only remedy from the dazzling colors exaggerated by the sunlight.

This influence, which Shakespeare so loved<br />\nto dwell upon, is just as evident today as it ever was, and it is on a<br />\ncollege campus that this influence<br />\nis best perceived and appreciated.<br />\nMembers of the faculty sitting<br />\nby open windows turn their attentions to poems and writings of the<br />\nazure skies and breezes gentle<br />\nozones, written of every land in<br />\nthe native tongue of each. Some<br />\ndevote themselves to leisurely<br />\nthoughtful strolls along the boarded walks of the upper quadrangle<br />\nand the graveled paths of the botanical garden. Botanists reflect<br />\non plant life and the coming<br />\nspring, Historians are thoughtful<br />\nover international problems, and<br />\neconomists cogitate on new farm<br />\nproblems.

Though events of'nonathletic importance spot the campus calendar, there is only one athletic contests to arouse the interest of the students. As a result, athletic enthusiasm has died down and perforce our sporting blood has<br />\ncooled to a degree of abnormality.<br />\nTrue, the lull during the \"non-athletic\" season is not of our own<br />\nchoosing. If conditions, financial and otherwise, are such that minor<br />\nmid-winter sports must be dispensed with, we can only suffer the consequences. Still the fact remains, our athletic interests at the present<br />\ntime are dormant.<br />\nThe annual Hopkins-Fifth Regiment Indoor Games, the highwater mark of the Hopkins mid-winter season, are scheduled for<br />\nFebruary 23. Never before in the history of indoor track has the<br />\nBaltimore public or Johns Hopkins had the opportunity of seeing<br />\nsuch a collection of world-famed stars, runners such as Nurmi, Ritola, Ray, Booth, Clark, Murchison and others. Other colleges and<br />\nsport fans are looking forward with interest to this athletic feature.<br />\nMany students elsewhere are known to be \"hocking\" their watches in<br />\norder to procure the necessary means to attend such a stellar meet.<br />\nStill the Hopkins campus continues to go on in the same smooth<br />\neasy going trend, with an air of indifference toward the indoor meet.<br />\nThe question, are our sporting interests asleep, answers itself in the<br />\naffirmative.<br />\nWhatever the cause of this apparent lack of interest, whether or<br />\nnot it is a result of the absence of minor sports, it is a condition which<br />\nshould be curbed, lest the students sleep through the meet on February 23. Obviously, the solution of the problem should be left in<br />\nthe hands of the Athletic Association. Perhaps that group could<br />\nawaken interest by bringing the importance of the meet to the students' attention at the weekly Assemblies. Perhaps a student section at the Armory might be reserved with tickets at a slightly reduced price. Any method of arousing interest will insure greater attendance and add to the success of the meet.<br /><br />\n, member of the Class of 1926, was dismissed from<br />\nMr.<br />\nthe School of Engineering upon recommendation of the Student<br />\n's conduct was of a nature unbecoming to a<br />\nCouncil that Mr.<br />\ngentleman.<br /><br />\nFollowing one of the longest<br />\nsieges of wintry weather that has<br />\never transformed this \"Dixieland\"<br />\ncampus into that of a more northern clime, spring-like warmth,<br />\nborne on the crest of a gentle south<br />\nwind, served Thursday and Friday<br />\nto dissipate wintry omens and lend<br />\na faint verdure to the ground so<br />\nlong snow covered. It did more<br />\nthan that, however. It permeated<br />\nthe campus with an air of awakening, which was manifested in the<br />\nundergraduates, just emerging from<br />\nthe inevitable stupor caused by unaccustomed concentration.<br />\nOut behind the engineering buildings a group of students engaged in<br />\na baseball match, and down in front<br />\nof the Barn Store, such a display<br />\nof ties were arrayed that smoked<br />\nglasses, many of them bought for<br />\nthe recent eclipse,, were suggested<br />\nas the only remedy from the dazzling colors exaggerated by the sunlight.
