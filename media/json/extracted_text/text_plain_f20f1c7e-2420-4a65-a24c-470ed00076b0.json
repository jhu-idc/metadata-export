There are two<br />\nchairs in his office; the one behind the desk is a<br />\nstraight-backed secretary's chair. The one in front<br />\nOf the desk, the visitor's chair, is high-backed, deep,<br />\nand covered in black leather.<br />\nHollingsworth and Huggins went to school<br />\ntogether. Hollingsworth was an amateur radio<br />\nOperator; when he talked, Huggins listened and<br />\nlearned enough to earn his baccalaureate degree in<br />\nelectrical engineering from Oregon State College in<br />\n1941.<br />\nHollingsworth is now a vice-president of the<br />\nBoeing Aircraft Corporation; Dr. Huggins chairs<br />\nthe Electrical Engineering Department at Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"I like to teach.\" Huggins has a broad, kind smile<br />\nand soft eyes underneath thinning, curly gray hair.<br />\n\"There is a tremendous emotional satisfaction in<br />\nmaking meaningful and important and useful<br />\nideas.\"<br />\nHis voice is soft and resonant, and he leans forward to emphasize his point. \"I have always enjoyed my work with undergraduates more than my<br />\nwork with graduate students.\"<br />\nBut he thinks he is bragging about his skills.<br />\nLowering his eyes and leaning back, he says, \"I'm<br />\nbeing too generous with myself.\" He explains that<br />\nbecause he was invited here as a full professor, he<br />\nescaped the \"publish or perish\" problems of junior<br />\nfaculty members who must concentrate on their<br />\nresearch to the detriment of their students.<br />\nDr. Huggins was born in Rupert, Idaho, a small<br />\n<br />\n'town in the southern part of the state on the edge of<br />\nthe desert. When his father died at the beginning of<br />\nthe Depression, the family moved to Eugene,<br />\nOregon.<br />\n\"Work has been a pretty large hunk of my life. I<br />\nused to play the piano, but that has gone by the way.<br />\nBut work for me has never really been work. I've<br />\nalways enjoyed it.<br />\n<br />\nthrough - - he always has a remarkable ability to<br />\nsee to the core of a problem. His work has always<br />\nset him apart\"<br />\nHuggins'eyes drop to the desk top in front of him,<br />\nand his voice is a little tired.<br />\n\"As you get older, you see more and more things<br />\nthat need being done. But you accrete obligations,<br />\nand you don't have the energy to do all the things<br />\nyou want to do.<br />\n\"It's always pleasant when summer comes<br />\naround. I can roll up my sleeves and work on one<br />\nthing for a while.\"<br />\nDr. Huggins finds that the duties of a department<br />\nchairman fill his day. \"Don't ask me what sort of<br />\n,research I'm getting done. I'm too busy with other<br />\nthings.\" Does he regret the loss? \"No, no, it has to<br />\nbe done.<br />\n\"But I have a theory,\" he says, and shakes his<br />\nhead in a gesture of regret. \"Each of us has only a<br />\ncertain number of starts in him. Switching from<br />\nproject to project the way I do, I see this pile of blue<br />\nchips dwindling away. The energy wasted is<br />\n'tremendous.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"One of the important things you have to learn is<br />\nwhat not to do. The tragedy is, the more innovative a<br />\nperson is, the harder it is to get anything done.\"<br />\nIt is hard to say whether Dr. Huggins considers<br />\nhimself innovative. But the opinion of his peers is<br />\nunanimous. For example, Dr. Robert Rich of APL:<br />\n\"This is a man who does so many things so well, I<br />\ndon't know where to begin. It doesn't matter which<br />\nof the many intellectual doors you approach him<br />\n<br />\nTen years ago, Dr. Huggins became part owner of<br />\na farm on the Lost River about forty miles from Sun<br />\nValley, Idaho. The farm's 230 acres graze 140 head<br />\nof beef cattle and produce 4000 sacks of seed potatos<br />\neach year. His manner becomes lighter when he<br />\ntalks of the farm. He thumbs through envelopes of<br />\nphotographs, looking for one of the farm, and is<br />\nannoyed when he can't find it. \"More and more<br />\nthese days,\" he says, \"my interests are turning<br />\nfrom signal analysis to farming . . .\"<br />\n<br />\nRussian Shifts to Goucher Philosophy Grads<br />\nworked out between Goucher<br />\nand Hopkins.<br />\nReading Knowledge<br />\nAccording to Dr. Henley,<br />\nHopkins<br />\nand<br />\nGoucher<br />\nRussian courses are not<br />\ntaught in the same way. At<br />\nGoucher, the emphasis is on<br />\nthe oral approach while<br />\nHopkins emphasizes reading<br />\nknowledge of the language.<br />\n<br />\nStudents here will still be<br />\nable to take Russian following<br />\nthe phase-out of the Hopkins<br />\nprogram expected by 1972.<br />\nCourses in the language will<br />\nbe offered in conjunction with<br />\nGoucher.<br />\n\"We're in the process of<br />\nnegotiating with Goucher<br />\nover how the Russian<br />\nprogram will work,\" said<br />\nDean Carl Swanson.<br />\nThe financial arrangement<br />\nis the major issue yet to be<br />\ndecided.<br />\nLentuley,<br />\nRudy<br />\nDr.<br />\nat<br />\nprofessor<br />\nRussian<br />\nGoucher, suggested, \"The<br />\npractical thing would be to<br />\nhave a Goucher professor<br />\ncome to Hopkins to teach, if<br />\nthere are a lot of Russian<br />\nstudents there.\"<br />\nHe added, \"We have to<br />\nknow what decision is<br />\nreached soon, so we can<br />\nreview our courses.\"<br />\nMay Pay<br />\nDean<br />\nto<br />\nAccording<br />\nSwanson, financial<br />\narrangements depend on the<br />\nnumber of Hopkins students<br />\nin Russian. Hopkins may pay<br />\nGoucher the costs of hiring<br />\nadditional Russian faculty if<br />\nenough Hopkins students sign<br />\nup for Russian courses.<br />\nRussian at Hopkins was<br />\nbudgeted between $14,000 and<br />\n$15,000 last year.<br />\n<br />\n\"If Goucher teachers want<br />\nto make the adjustment to a<br />\nnew teaching method, they<br />\ncan,\" said Henley.<br />\n<br />\nCarl Swanson<br />\n<br />\nSwanson said the Russian<br />\nprogram has been financed<br />\noffice.<br />\nhis<br />\nthrough<br />\n\"Academic programs should<br />\nnot be run from the Dean's<br />\noffice,\" Swanson observed.<br />\n<br />\nViolence Symposium<br />\nSchedule through November 18<br />\nDR.

Boys<br />\n<br />\nrte.)<br />\n<br />\nHow to Prevent Students<br />\nThe chief reason why today's college students are so restless is of<br />\ncourse tight pants.<br />\nBut other factors also contribute, and one of them, I fear, is boredom. All too often, I fear, students find their classes dull beyond endurance. Let's face it: the modern undergraduate, caught in the grip<br />\nof history and his zipper, is far too impatient to sit through old-fashioned lectures delivered in the old-fashioned way.<br />\nNovelty, excitement, stimulation\u2014that's what it takes to grab a<br />\nstudent's attention these days. And wise teachers know it. On campuses everywhere they are trying bold new techniques to pique and<br />\nengross their classes. Take, for example, Ralph Waldo Sigafoos, the<br />\ndistinguished professor of economics at the University of Florida, who<br />\nnow delivers his lectures nude.<br />\nOr let's take E. Pluribus Ewbank, the distinguished professor of<br />\nEnglish literature at the University of Minnesota where it's too cold<br />\nto lecture in your buff. Ilere's what Professor Ewbank does: when he's<br />\nteaching, for instance, Shelley's immortal To a Skylark, he pauses<br />\nafter each stanza and does 2,1 ., minutes of bird calls. Believe me, he<br />\ngets a terrific hand every time, but of course the biggest hand comes<br />\nat the end of the poem when he eats a worm. The kids sometimes applaud till nightfall.<br />\nAnother innovation by the same resourceful Professor Ewbank is<br />\nto make poetry more relevant to his students by taking them to the<br />\nactual locale of each poem. Last month, for example, while lecturing<br />\non Wordsworth's immortal Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tinter?'<br />\nAbbey, he rented a Zeppelin, flew his entire class to England, and<br />\nmoored on the same moor where Wordsworth wrote his immortal<br />\nlines. Then everyone deblimped and had a jolly good picnic, complete<br />\nwith Morris dancing, three-legged races, pie-eating contests, and of<br />\ncourse that without which you'd never call a picnic complete. I refer<br />\nof course to Miller High Life Beer.<br />\nIf there are still some of you haven't tried Miller High Life\u2014<br />\nyou're laughing, but it's possible\u2014let me tell you what you're missing.<br />\nYou're missing flavor, pleasure, refreshment, comfort, satisfaction,<br />\nfelicity, truth, beauty, malt and hops. There is no other beer like Miller.<br />\nHow can there be? Miller's marvelous brewing formula has been a<br />\nclosely guarded secret for generations. In fact, it's known today to<br />\nonly one man in the whole world \u2014Miller's chief brewmaster\u2014 and he<br />\nhas been trained to eat himself if ever taken alive.<br />\nSo if you haven't tried Miller yet\u2014you're laughing, but it's possible\u2014get a bottle or can right away. The bottles are beautifully made<br />\nof transparent glass. The cans aren't bad-looking either; they are,<br />\nhowever, opaque.<br />\nBut I digress. We were talking about the new breed of teacher<br />\nwho doesn't just stand in front of his class and drone. No, sir! He demonstrates. He illustrates. He dramatizes. Take, for example, Glebe of<br />\nU.C.L.A., professor of marine biology. He doesn't just tell the kids<br />\nabout the strange life-forms beneath the sea. Instead he brings a live<br />\nsponge to class so they can see it. Similarly, Gransmire of North Carolina State, professor of textile engineering, brings a live washcloth.<br />\nThen there's Williams of Amherst, professor of library science,<br />\nwho brings a live Dewey Decimal. And of course there's SchumannHeink of Hardin-Simmons, professor of Indo-European, who brings a<br />\nlive hyphen. And Champert of Utah A & M, professor of Hebrew<br />\nphilology, who brings a nice Jewish girl.<br />\nAnd so to those who despair of ever winning back our alienated<br />\nstudents, I have only this to say: remember that America did not become the world's greatest producer of butterfat and milk solids by<br />\nrunning away from a fight! Right on!<br />\n<br />\nWe,the brewers of Miller High Life Beer and sponsors of this column,<br />\nhave made what seems to us a very sensible arrangement with Max Shulman. We don't tell him how to write and he doesn't tell us how to brew.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 6<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nNovember 6, 1970<br />\n<br />\nStudent Rights Undefined at Private Schools<br />\n(contie,ued from page 12),<br />\noral or written report on the<br />\nfacts of the testimony of each.<br />\nIt also guaranteed the<br />\nstudent an opportunity to<br />\npresent his own defense<br />\nagainst the charges and a<br />\nchance to produce either oral<br />\ntestimony or written affidavits of witnesses in his<br />\nbehalf.<br />\n*Respect<br />\nfor<br />\nthe<br />\npresumption of innocence<br />\nrequires that the university<br />\nnot impose academic sanctions for the sole reason that a<br />\nstudent is or has been involved<br />\ncriminal<br />\nin<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nA student charged with or<br />\nconvicted of a crime must not<br />\nbe subjected to academic<br />\nsanctions by the university<br />\nfor the same offense.<br />\nThe results and findings of<br />\nhearing<br />\nthe<br />\nmust be<br />\npresented in a report open to<br />\nthe student's inspection.<br />\n*When a student commits a<br />\nminor infraction of college<br />\nregulations, penalized by<br />\n<br />\nsmall fines or reprimands<br />\nwhich do not become part of<br />\nhis permanent record, the<br />\npenalty may be handled by<br />\nthe<br />\nappropriate<br />\na dm ini stra tive, faculty, or<br />\nstudent officer.

You might join them.<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduate Notes<br />\nA few thought slivers. . .<br />\nThis week President Gordon termed undergraduate<br />\neducation a \"conundrum,\" while Dean Benton was<br />\ncontent to use the verbiage \"a great problem.\" To<br />\nGordon, the undergraduate program is \"not a good fit,\"<br />\nbut a collegiate division is no solution, he injected. It has<br />\nbeen tried at Columbia and Chicago, causing an \"unsatisfactory\" situation. Maybe Professor Lynn should<br />\nstudy his history better.<br />\nBenton was more explicit: undergraduate enrollment<br />\nshould probably be cut in the future making way for a<br />\n\"small, but highly-selective undergraduate body.\" For<br />\nmore teaching, the dean offered a courageous plan. \"By<br />\nmy persuasion,\" he intoned, the faculty will teach more<br />\nundergraduate courses. \"But it has to be done by<br />\nevolution,\" he quickly added.<br />\nThe decision whether to retain an undergraduate dean<br />\nmight be decided.over the weekend, Benton reported.<br />\nEarlier, he said that administrative efficiency would be<br />\nimproved without a dean devoting his entire time to<br />\nundergrads.<br />\nBenton said there are no plans to reshuffle departments to accommodate the masses of liberal arts undergraduates. \"If adjustments are made in some<br />\nareas,\" he noted,\"there will be a net increase in costs.\"<br />\nAnd the tuition increases year after year after year.<br />\nUndergraduates, discounting scholarships, contribute<br />\n14 per cent towards Homewood's budget ($3.9 million a<br />\nyear). For such services they receive...oh, of course...<br />\nthe \"prestige\" of being here.<br />\n<br />\nBy MARTIN VOGEL<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 You are dissatisfied with your education.<br />\n<br />\nYou aren't an unusual individual. There is an<br />\nundercurrent of dissatisfaction with undergraduate education.<br />\nHere are some facts that bring that undercurrent to the surface: In my freshman<br />\nyear, less than 1% of my class enrollment<br />\nwas in courses of 20 people or less. That<br />\nyear, 76% of freshman enrollment was in<br />\ncourses of 150 people or more. But I was<br />\npromised that in time my courses would get<br />\nsmaller. Indeed, in time enrollment in small<br />\ncourses increases. The figures are as follows<br />\nfor enrollment in seminar-sized classed of 20<br />\npeople or less:<br />\nFreshmen<br />\n0.8%<br />\nSophomores<br />\n4.3%<br />\nJuniors<br />\n10.3%<br />\nThis means that the greatest amount of<br />\nour time is spent in big lectures with lots of<br />\npeople and no time for questions. Even<br />\nseniors spend the majority of time in classes<br />\nthat are too large for meaningful, discussion<br />\nand questioning. The figures of classes with<br />\nenrollment greater than 40 students are as<br />\nfollows:<br />\nFreshmen<br />\n96.9%<br />\nSophomores<br />\n79.3%<br />\nJuniors<br />\n65.0%<br />\nSeniors<br />\n55.8%<br />\nIf you dispute the veracity of these figures,<br />\ncheck the Dean's Office. If you can't figure<br />\nout what those figures mean, look at the sea<br />\nof bored faces surrounding you in class.<br />\nBut not only are our classes very large,<br />\ncourse choice is very limited. There is no<br />\ndiversity. Smaller schools offer more. Use<br />\nthe English Department as an example:<br />\nHopkins offers 12 courses. Swarthmore with<br />\n1100 students, offers 23; Amherst offers 14;<br />\nColgate offers 20; so does Williams. None of<br />\nthese schools are larger than Hopkins and<br />\nyet they offer much more.<br />\nThe schools used for comparison are, of<br />\ncourse, colleges and not universities. But the<br />\nincongruity of the comparison points out that<br />\nat Hopkins the needs of the undergraduate<br />\n<br />\nare being sacrificed for other priorities:<br />\ninstead of teaching, Hopkins emphasizes<br />\nresearch, publishing and graduate<br />\neducation. Blatant examples of this have<br />\nsurfaced recently: The position of Undergraduate Dean is being eliminated;<br />\nEducation and Russian will no longer be with<br />\nus; the Writing Seminars are in<br />\njeopardy: English no longer has independent study; and Social Relations is a<br />\none-man department.<br />\nOnly a basic readjustment will eliminate<br />\nthe crux of the problem: competing<br />\ndemands. To create an undergraduate<br />\ncollege with its own professors and Dean,<br />\nand with first priority to teaching, will solve<br />\nmost undergraduate problems. The most<br />\ncompelling reasons for creating a college<br />\nare increased access to professors,<br />\navailability of more courses and the<br />\nelimination of graduate and research<br />\ndemands on undergraduate professors.<br />\n\u2022 Present financial restrictions can be<br />\nignored by increasing total enrollment and<br />\nusing increased revenues to create new, and<br />\nto bolster existing, departments.<br />\nSome professors may leave. Presumably,<br />\nthese would be the ones who do not wish to<br />\nteach. But if this is their attitude, are we not<br />\nbetter off to see them depart and be replaced<br />\nby professors who enjoy teaching. Now is an<br />\nopportune time to select good, new<br />\nprofessors in the abundant labor market.<br />\nIs asking for an undergraduate college<br />\nasking for a dream? Certainly Hopkins is not<br />\nliving up to its potential for undergraduate<br />\neducation. For ninety years, suggestions for<br />\nreform have met no result and evaded the<br />\ndilemma of this university. The proposal for<br />\nan undergraduate college, different though it<br />\nmay be, offers a much better opportunity to<br />\nconfront and overcome our problem. It may<br />\nforce major change, but because it promises<br />\ngreat improvement in our education, it<br />\ndeserves support.<br />\nMartin Vogel, a junior, is Secretary of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nFencing Mask<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nI wish to congratulate you<br />\non your incredible display of<br />\neditorial fairness when you<br />\npublished that jaundiced letter<br />\nof the Fencing \"Coach, Mr.<br />\nDick Oles.<br />\nWhat rhetorical compost<br />\nheap this man has been<br />\ngleaning his political and<br />\nsocial ideas from is beyond<br />\ncomprehension. The fact that<br />\nhe can't even see the<br />\ndiscrepancies of his own<br />\narguments on his own<br />\ncampus is unbelievable.<br />\nMr. Oles neglects to<br />\nmention<br />\nthe<br />\ndistinct<br />\nprobability that one month<br />\nbefore the \"Cambodian Invasion,\" Nixon's shock<br />\ntroops, the CIA, placed the<br />\nfriendly Asian fascist general<br />\n(pro-American), Lon Nol, in<br />\npower. If Mr. Oles is so<br />\nanxious to protect the<br />\nCambodians, why didn't he<br />\nsay anything then?<br />\nNot to be content to slur<br />\nanyone who might suggest<br />\nthat our foreign policy closely<br />\nresembles genocide, he intimates that protesters are<br />\neither gutless, or else a \"mob<br />\nof animals\". Mob<br />\nof<br />\nAnimals?! Perhaps Mr.<br />\nOles has heard of My Lai,<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps not.<br />\nHis observations become<br />\neven more unbelievable as he<br />\ntries to lump together active<br />\nrevolutionaries and pacifists<br />\nin the same bag. With long<br />\nhair, I suppose they do look<br />\nalike. However, this is just an<br />\necho of \"Well, they're black<br />\nand have kinky hair, can't tell<br />\n'em apart\" routine. We've<br />\nbeen through this before.<br />\nFinally, Mr. Oles has<br />\nignored the fact that of the<br />\nfour \"animals\" killed at Kent<br />\nState, three were innocent<br />\nbystanders. One was an<br />\nactive participant in ROTC.<br />\nOne girl was shot in the head<br />\nfive times as she was walking<br />\nto class with a friend.<br />\nMr. Oles was right. There<br />\nwere animals at Kent State.<br />\nThey weren't students,<br />\nthough. However, these<br />\nstudents dared question the<br />\nGod-given authority of the<br />\nU.S. Government.

It<br />\nis his feeling tha the clause .is<br />\nnot only illegal but the fact<br />\nthat it makes a player an<br />\nobject liable to cash sale is<br />\nimmoral.<br />\nThe Flood case is now going<br />\nthrough the judicial process<br />\n<br />\nin the usual manner. The<br />\nincident that sparked the suit<br />\nwas Flood's trade from the<br />\nCardinals to the Phillies.<br />\nFlood was a fine center<br />\nfielder for the Cards for many<br />\nyears and was earning a<br />\nsalary of $100,000. One of the<br />\nsore points was that Flood<br />\nwas never notified of the<br />\ntrade until he found out in the<br />\nnewspaper.<br />\nFlood never reported to the<br />\nPhiladelphia club, preferring<br />\ninstead to fight the legality of<br />\nthe reserve clause.<br />\n<br />\nThe suit claims $4.1 million<br />\nin damages and claims that<br />\nthe National and American<br />\nBaseball Leagues present a<br />\nsituation of \"restraint of<br />\ntrade\" against the players<br />\nwho are not allowed to<br />\nbargain fairly:<br />\nThe Reserve Clause states<br />\nthat a player is bound to the<br />\nteam that contracts him until<br />\nhe is traded, released, or<br />\nquits. Flood calls this a form<br />\nof \"slavery.\"<br />\nThere is no reserve clause<br />\nin football, and a player can<br />\nplay out his contract by<br />\nplaying for a year without a<br />\ncontract at a maximum 10%<br />\ncut in salary. There has been<br />\nno real problem and football<br />\nhas survived this lack.<br />\n<br />\nFlood has already lost his<br />\ninitial court case, a Federal<br />\nCourt Judge in New York<br />\nruling against him recently.<br />\nThe case is being appealed to<br />\na higher tribunal and may<br />\neventually be heard in the<br />\nSupreme Court.<br />\n<br />\nWhen a player plays out his<br />\noption he is designated a free<br />\nagent. In this category he can<br />\nsign with which ever club he<br />\nwishes but his loss will mean<br />\nthe club who signs him must<br />\ngive up a player of \"equal<br />\nability.\" This ambiguity is<br />\ndecided by the commissioner.<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nBIA Football<br />\nFinal Standings<br />\nFraternity League<br />\nATO<br />\nDU<br />\nTau Ep<br />\nPhi Ep<br />\nPhi Gam<br />\nSig Ep<br />\nSig Nu<br />\nKA<br />\nBeta<br />\nPhi Sig<br />\n<br />\n9-0<br />\n7-2<br />\n7-2<br />\n5-3-1<br />\n4-4-1<br />\n3-6<br />\n2-6-1<br />\n2-7<br />\nforfeited out<br />\nforfeited out<br />\n<br />\nDormitory League<br />\nBaker<br />\nAdams<br />\nHollander<br />\n<br />\n7-1<br />\n6-1-1<br />\n5-3<br />\n<br />\nIndependent League<br />\nWelborn<br />\nRoan<br />\n<br />\n4-0<br />\n2-2<br />\n<br />\nFloods latest surprise was<br />\nthe<br />\nwith<br />\nsigning<br />\nhis<br />\nWashington Senators.

There are two<br />\nchairs in his office; the one behind the desk is a<br />\nstraight-backed secretary's chair. The one in front<br />\nOf the desk, the visitor's chair, is high-backed, deep,<br />\nand covered in black leather.<br />\nHollingsworth and Huggins went to school<br />\ntogether. Hollingsworth was an amateur radio<br />\nOperator; when he talked, Huggins listened and<br />\nlearned enough to earn his baccalaureate degree in<br />\nelectrical engineering from Oregon State College in<br />\n1941.<br />\nHollingsworth is now a vice-president of the<br />\nBoeing Aircraft Corporation; Dr. Huggins chairs<br />\nthe Electrical Engineering Department at Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"I like to teach.\" Huggins has a broad, kind smile<br />\nand soft eyes underneath thinning, curly gray hair.<br />\n\"There is a tremendous emotional satisfaction in<br />\nmaking meaningful and important and useful<br />\nideas.\"<br />\nHis voice is soft and resonant, and he leans forward to emphasize his point. \"I have always enjoyed my work with undergraduates more than my<br />\nwork with graduate students.\"<br />\nBut he thinks he is bragging about his skills.<br />\nLowering his eyes and leaning back, he says, \"I'm<br />\nbeing too generous with myself.\" He explains that<br />\nbecause he was invited here as a full professor, he<br />\nescaped the \"publish or perish\" problems of junior<br />\nfaculty members who must concentrate on their<br />\nresearch to the detriment of their students.<br />\nDr. Huggins was born in Rupert, Idaho, a small<br /><br />\n'town in the southern part of the state on the edge of<br />\nthe desert. When his father died at the beginning of<br />\nthe Depression, the family moved to Eugene,<br />\nOregon.<br />\n\"Work has been a pretty large hunk of my life. I<br />\nused to play the piano, but that has gone by the way.<br />\nBut work for me has never really been work. I've<br />\nalways enjoyed it.<br /><br />\nthrough - - he always has a remarkable ability to<br />\nsee to the core of a problem. His work has always<br />\nset him apart\"<br />\nHuggins'eyes drop to the desk top in front of him,<br />\nand his voice is a little tired.<br />\n\"As you get older, you see more and more things<br />\nthat need being done. But you accrete obligations,<br />\nand you don't have the energy to do all the things<br />\nyou want to do.<br />\n\"It's always pleasant when summer comes<br />\naround. I can roll up my sleeves and work on one<br />\nthing for a while.\"<br />\nDr. Huggins finds that the duties of a department<br />\nchairman fill his day. \"Don't ask me what sort of<br />\n,research I'm getting done. I'm too busy with other<br />\nthings.\" Does he regret the loss? \"No, no, it has to<br />\nbe done.<br />\n\"But I have a theory,\" he says, and shakes his<br />\nhead in a gesture of regret. \"Each of us has only a<br />\ncertain number of starts in him. Switching from<br />\nproject to project the way I do, I see this pile of blue<br />\nchips dwindling away. The energy wasted is<br />\n'tremendous.\"<br /><br />\n\"One of the important things you have to learn is<br />\nwhat not to do. The tragedy is, the more innovative a<br />\nperson is, the harder it is to get anything done.\"<br />\nIt is hard to say whether Dr. Huggins considers<br />\nhimself innovative. But the opinion of his peers is<br />\nunanimous. For example, Dr. Robert Rich of APL:<br />\n\"This is a man who does so many things so well, I<br />\ndon't know where to begin. It doesn't matter which<br />\nof the many intellectual doors you approach him<br /><br />\nTen years ago, Dr. Huggins became part owner of<br />\na farm on the Lost River about forty miles from Sun<br />\nValley, Idaho. The farm's 230 acres graze 140 head<br />\nof beef cattle and produce 4000 sacks of seed potatos<br />\neach year. His manner becomes lighter when he<br />\ntalks of the farm. He thumbs through envelopes of<br />\nphotographs, looking for one of the farm, and is<br />\nannoyed when he can't find it. \"More and more<br />\nthese days,\" he says, \"my interests are turning<br />\nfrom signal analysis to farming . . .\"<br /><br />\nRussian Shifts to Goucher Philosophy Grads<br />\nworked out between Goucher<br />\nand Hopkins.<br />\nReading Knowledge<br />\nAccording to Dr. Henley,<br />\nHopkins<br />\nand<br />\nGoucher<br />\nRussian courses are not<br />\ntaught in the same way. At<br />\nGoucher, the emphasis is on<br />\nthe oral approach while<br />\nHopkins emphasizes reading<br />\nknowledge of the language.<br /><br />\nStudents here will still be<br />\nable to take Russian following<br />\nthe phase-out of the Hopkins<br />\nprogram expected by 1972.<br />\nCourses in the language will<br />\nbe offered in conjunction with<br />\nGoucher.<br />\n\"We're in the process of<br />\nnegotiating with Goucher<br />\nover how the Russian<br />\nprogram will work,\" said<br />\nDean Carl Swanson.<br />\nThe financial arrangement<br />\nis the major issue yet to be<br />\ndecided.<br />\nLentuley,<br />\nRudy<br />\nDr.<br />\nat<br />\nprofessor<br />\nRussian<br />\nGoucher, suggested, \"The<br />\npractical thing would be to<br />\nhave a Goucher professor<br />\ncome to Hopkins to teach, if<br />\nthere are a lot of Russian<br />\nstudents there.\"<br />\nHe added, \"We have to<br />\nknow what decision is<br />\nreached soon, so we can<br />\nreview our courses.\"<br />\nMay Pay<br />\nDean<br />\nto<br />\nAccording<br />\nSwanson, financial<br />\narrangements depend on the<br />\nnumber of Hopkins students<br />\nin Russian. Hopkins may pay<br />\nGoucher the costs of hiring<br />\nadditional Russian faculty if<br />\nenough Hopkins students sign<br />\nup for Russian courses.<br />\nRussian at Hopkins was<br />\nbudgeted between $14,000 and<br />\n$15,000 last year.<br /><br />\n\"If Goucher teachers want<br />\nto make the adjustment to a<br />\nnew teaching method, they<br />\ncan,\" said Henley.<br /><br />\nCarl Swanson<br /><br />\nSwanson said the Russian<br />\nprogram has been financed<br />\noffice.<br />\nhis<br />\nthrough<br />\n\"Academic programs should<br />\nnot be run from the Dean's<br />\noffice,\" Swanson observed.<br /><br />\nViolence Symposium<br />\nSchedule through November 18<br />\nDR.

Boys<br /><br />\nrte.)<br /><br />\nHow to Prevent Students<br />\nThe chief reason why today's college students are so restless is of<br />\ncourse tight pants.<br />\nBut other factors also contribute, and one of them, I fear, is boredom. All too often, I fear, students find their classes dull beyond endurance. Let's face it: the modern undergraduate, caught in the grip<br />\nof history and his zipper, is far too impatient to sit through old-fashioned lectures delivered in the old-fashioned way.<br />\nNovelty, excitement, stimulation\u2014that's what it takes to grab a<br />\nstudent's attention these days. And wise teachers know it. On campuses everywhere they are trying bold new techniques to pique and<br />\nengross their classes. Take, for example, Ralph Waldo Sigafoos, the<br />\ndistinguished professor of economics at the University of Florida, who<br />\nnow delivers his lectures nude.<br />\nOr let's take E. Pluribus Ewbank, the distinguished professor of<br />\nEnglish literature at the University of Minnesota where it's too cold<br />\nto lecture in your buff. Ilere's what Professor Ewbank does: when he's<br />\nteaching, for instance, Shelley's immortal To a Skylark, he pauses<br />\nafter each stanza and does 2,1 ., minutes of bird calls. Believe me, he<br />\ngets a terrific hand every time, but of course the biggest hand comes<br />\nat the end of the poem when he eats a worm. The kids sometimes applaud till nightfall.<br />\nAnother innovation by the same resourceful Professor Ewbank is<br />\nto make poetry more relevant to his students by taking them to the<br />\nactual locale of each poem. Last month, for example, while lecturing<br />\non Wordsworth's immortal Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tinter?'<br />\nAbbey, he rented a Zeppelin, flew his entire class to England, and<br />\nmoored on the same moor where Wordsworth wrote his immortal<br />\nlines. Then everyone deblimped and had a jolly good picnic, complete<br />\nwith Morris dancing, three-legged races, pie-eating contests, and of<br />\ncourse that without which you'd never call a picnic complete. I refer<br />\nof course to Miller High Life Beer.<br />\nIf there are still some of you haven't tried Miller High Life\u2014<br />\nyou're laughing, but it's possible\u2014let me tell you what you're missing.<br />\nYou're missing flavor, pleasure, refreshment, comfort, satisfaction,<br />\nfelicity, truth, beauty, malt and hops. There is no other beer like Miller.<br />\nHow can there be? Miller's marvelous brewing formula has been a<br />\nclosely guarded secret for generations. In fact, it's known today to<br />\nonly one man in the whole world \u2014Miller's chief brewmaster\u2014 and he<br />\nhas been trained to eat himself if ever taken alive.<br />\nSo if you haven't tried Miller yet\u2014you're laughing, but it's possible\u2014get a bottle or can right away. The bottles are beautifully made<br />\nof transparent glass. The cans aren't bad-looking either; they are,<br />\nhowever, opaque.<br />\nBut I digress. We were talking about the new breed of teacher<br />\nwho doesn't just stand in front of his class and drone. No, sir! He demonstrates. He illustrates. He dramatizes. Take, for example, Glebe of<br />\nU.C.L.A., professor of marine biology. He doesn't just tell the kids<br />\nabout the strange life-forms beneath the sea. Instead he brings a live<br />\nsponge to class so they can see it. Similarly, Gransmire of North Carolina State, professor of textile engineering, brings a live washcloth.<br />\nThen there's Williams of Amherst, professor of library science,<br />\nwho brings a live Dewey Decimal. And of course there's SchumannHeink of Hardin-Simmons, professor of Indo-European, who brings a<br />\nlive hyphen. And Champert of Utah A &amp; M, professor of Hebrew<br />\nphilology, who brings a nice Jewish girl.<br />\nAnd so to those who despair of ever winning back our alienated<br />\nstudents, I have only this to say: remember that America did not become the world's greatest producer of butterfat and milk solids by<br />\nrunning away from a fight! Right on!<br /><br />\nWe,the brewers of Miller High Life Beer and sponsors of this column,<br />\nhave made what seems to us a very sensible arrangement with Max Shulman.

You might join them.<br /><br />\nUndergraduate Notes<br />\nA few thought slivers. . .<br />\nThis week President Gordon termed undergraduate<br />\neducation a \"conundrum,\" while Dean Benton was<br />\ncontent to use the verbiage \"a great problem.\" To<br />\nGordon, the undergraduate program is \"not a good fit,\"<br />\nbut a collegiate division is no solution, he injected. It has<br />\nbeen tried at Columbia and Chicago, causing an \"unsatisfactory\" situation. Maybe Professor Lynn should<br />\nstudy his history better.<br />\nBenton was more explicit: undergraduate enrollment<br />\nshould probably be cut in the future making way for a<br />\n\"small, but highly-selective undergraduate body.\" For<br />\nmore teaching, the dean offered a courageous plan. \"By<br />\nmy persuasion,\" he intoned, the faculty will teach more<br />\nundergraduate courses. \"But it has to be done by<br />\nevolution,\" he quickly added.<br />\nThe decision whether to retain an undergraduate dean<br />\nmight be decided.over the weekend, Benton reported.<br />\nEarlier, he said that administrative efficiency would be<br />\nimproved without a dean devoting his entire time to<br />\nundergrads.<br />\nBenton said there are no plans to reshuffle departments to accommodate the masses of liberal arts undergraduates. \"If adjustments are made in some<br />\nareas,\" he noted,\"there will be a net increase in costs.\"<br />\nAnd the tuition increases year after year after year.<br />\nUndergraduates, discounting scholarships, contribute<br />\n14 per cent towards Homewood's budget ($3.9 million a<br />\nyear). For such services they receive...oh, of course...<br />\nthe \"prestige\" of being here.<br /><br />\nBy MARTIN VOGEL<br /><br />\n\u2022 You are dissatisfied with your education.<br /><br />\nYou aren't an unusual individual. There is an<br />\nundercurrent of dissatisfaction with undergraduate education.<br />\nHere are some facts that bring that undercurrent to the surface: In my freshman<br />\nyear, less than 1% of my class enrollment<br />\nwas in courses of 20 people or less. That<br />\nyear, 76% of freshman enrollment was in<br />\ncourses of 150 people or more. But I was<br />\npromised that in time my courses would get<br />\nsmaller. Indeed, in time enrollment in small<br />\ncourses increases. The figures are as follows<br />\nfor enrollment in seminar-sized classed of 20<br />\npeople or less:<br />\nFreshmen<br />\n0.8%<br />\nSophomores<br />\n4.3%<br />\nJuniors<br />\n10.3%<br />\nThis means that the greatest amount of<br />\nour time is spent in big lectures with lots of<br />\npeople and no time for questions. Even<br />\nseniors spend the majority of time in classes<br />\nthat are too large for meaningful, discussion<br />\nand questioning. The figures of classes with<br />\nenrollment greater than 40 students are as<br />\nfollows:<br />\nFreshmen<br />\n96.9%<br />\nSophomores<br />\n79.3%<br />\nJuniors<br />\n65.0%<br />\nSeniors<br />\n55.8%<br />\nIf you dispute the veracity of these figures,<br />\ncheck the Dean's Office. If you can't figure<br />\nout what those figures mean, look at the sea<br />\nof bored faces surrounding you in class.<br />\nBut not only are our classes very large,<br />\ncourse choice is very limited. There is no<br />\ndiversity. Smaller schools offer more. Use<br />\nthe English Department as an example:<br />\nHopkins offers 12 courses. Swarthmore with<br />\n1100 students, offers 23; Amherst offers 14;<br />\nColgate offers 20; so does Williams. None of<br />\nthese schools are larger than Hopkins and<br />\nyet they offer much more.<br />\nThe schools used for comparison are, of<br />\ncourse, colleges and not universities. But the<br />\nincongruity of the comparison points out that<br />\nat Hopkins the needs of the undergraduate<br /><br />\nare being sacrificed for other priorities:<br />\ninstead of teaching, Hopkins emphasizes<br />\nresearch, publishing and graduate<br />\neducation. Blatant examples of this have<br />\nsurfaced recently: The position of Undergraduate Dean is being eliminated;<br />\nEducation and Russian will no longer be with<br />\nus; the Writing Seminars are in<br />\njeopardy: English no longer has independent study; and Social Relations is a<br />\none-man department.<br />\nOnly a basic readjustment will eliminate<br />\nthe crux of the problem: competing<br />\ndemands. To create an undergraduate<br />\ncollege with its own professors and Dean,<br />\nand with first priority to teaching, will solve<br />\nmost undergraduate problems. The most<br />\ncompelling reasons for creating a college<br />\nare increased access to professors,<br />\navailability of more courses and the<br />\nelimination of graduate and research<br />\ndemands on undergraduate professors.<br />\n\u2022 Present financial restrictions can be<br />\nignored by increasing total enrollment and<br />\nusing increased revenues to create new, and<br />\nto bolster existing, departments.<br />\nSome professors may leave. Presumably,<br />\nthese would be the ones who do not wish to<br />\nteach. But if this is their attitude, are we not<br />\nbetter off to see them depart and be replaced<br />\nby professors who enjoy teaching. Now is an<br />\nopportune time to select good, new<br />\nprofessors in the abundant labor market.<br />\nIs asking for an undergraduate college<br />\nasking for a dream? Certainly Hopkins is not<br />\nliving up to its potential for undergraduate<br />\neducation. For ninety years, suggestions for<br />\nreform have met no result and evaded the<br />\ndilemma of this university. The proposal for<br />\nan undergraduate college, different though it<br />\nmay be, offers a much better opportunity to<br />\nconfront and overcome our problem. It may<br />\nforce major change, but because it promises<br />\ngreat improvement in our education, it<br />\ndeserves support.<br />\nMartin Vogel, a junior, is Secretary of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nFencing Mask<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nI wish to congratulate you<br />\non your incredible display of<br />\neditorial fairness when you<br />\npublished that jaundiced letter<br />\nof the Fencing \"Coach, Mr.<br />\nDick Oles.<br />\nWhat rhetorical compost<br />\nheap this man has been<br />\ngleaning his political and<br />\nsocial ideas from is beyond<br />\ncomprehension. The fact that<br />\nhe can't even see the<br />\ndiscrepancies of his own<br />\narguments on his own<br />\ncampus is unbelievable.<br />\nMr. Oles neglects to<br />\nmention<br />\nthe<br />\ndistinct<br />\nprobability that one month<br />\nbefore the \"Cambodian Invasion,\" Nixon's shock<br />\ntroops, the CIA, placed the<br />\nfriendly Asian fascist general<br />\n(pro-American), Lon Nol, in<br />\npower. If Mr. Oles is so<br />\nanxious to protect the<br />\nCambodians, why didn't he<br />\nsay anything then?<br />\nNot to be content to slur<br />\nanyone who might suggest<br />\nthat our foreign policy closely<br />\nresembles genocide, he intimates that protesters are<br />\neither gutless, or else a \"mob<br />\nof animals\". Mob<br />\nof<br />\nAnimals?! Perhaps Mr.<br />\nOles has heard of My Lai,<br /><br />\nPerhaps not.<br />\nHis observations become<br />\neven more unbelievable as he<br />\ntries to lump together active<br />\nrevolutionaries and pacifists<br />\nin the same bag. With long<br />\nhair, I suppose they do look<br />\nalike. However, this is just an<br />\necho of \"Well, they're black<br />\nand have kinky hair, can't tell<br />\n'em apart\" routine. We've<br />\nbeen through this before.<br />\nFinally, Mr. Oles has<br />\nignored the fact that of the<br />\nfour \"animals\" killed at Kent<br />\nState, three were innocent<br />\nbystanders. One was an<br />\nactive participant in ROTC.<br />\nOne girl was shot in the head<br />\nfive times as she was walking<br />\nto class with a friend.<br />\nMr. Oles was right. There<br />\nwere animals at Kent State.<br />\nThey weren't students,<br />\nthough. However, these<br />\nstudents dared question the<br />\nGod-given authority of the<br />\nU.S. Government. String 'em<br />\nup!<br />\nPerhaps if Mr. Oles took off<br />\nhis fencing mask, or walked<br />\noutside of the gym once or<br />\ntwice, and talked to some real<br />\npeople, he might be able to<br />\nsee the situation more<br />\nclearly.<br />\nBut I doubt it.<br />\nW.

One of the<br />\nsore points was that Flood<br />\nwas never notified of the<br />\ntrade until he found out in the<br />\nnewspaper.<br />\nFlood never reported to the<br />\nPhiladelphia club, preferring<br />\ninstead to fight the legality of<br />\nthe reserve clause.<br /><br />\nThe suit claims $4.1 million<br />\nin damages and claims that<br />\nthe National and American<br />\nBaseball Leagues present a<br />\nsituation of \"restraint of<br />\ntrade\" against the players<br />\nwho are not allowed to<br />\nbargain fairly:<br />\nThe Reserve Clause states<br />\nthat a player is bound to the<br />\nteam that contracts him until<br />\nhe is traded, released, or<br />\nquits. Flood calls this a form<br />\nof \"slavery.\"<br />\nThere is no reserve clause<br />\nin football, and a player can<br />\nplay out his contract by<br />\nplaying for a year without a<br />\ncontract at a maximum 10%<br />\ncut in salary.
