Jeffrey responded that<br />\ncont. on P. 22<br />\n<br />\nexisting dining facilities will be<br />\nconverted into common space.<br />\nThere are no specific plans on<br />\nhow that will proceed.<br />\nPeifer complained about the<br />\nlack of student involvement with<br />\nthe plans. \"This is student<br />\nhousing, and we [the Student<br />\nCouncil] represent students,\"<br />\nhe said. \"The University did a<br />\ndamn poor job in getting students involved in this project.\"<br />\nPeifer said that the plan \"is<br />\nnot the best,\" but felt that<br />\n\"anything is a relief\" considering<br />\nthe existing dormitories. He is<br />\ndisappointed that ihe plan does<br />\nnot concentrate student life in<br />\nthe northern part of campus by<br />\nproviding a greater amount of<br />\nnew housing. He also feels that<br />\nthe plan does not vastly increase<br />\nthe quality of housing. Referring to the Student Council's<br />\nprotest of the increase of double<br />\nbedrooms in off-campus apartments, Peifer complained that<br />\ncont. on p.<br />\n<br />\n\"a defeat and a victory.\" He<br />\nbelieves that the action is a<br />\npositive step in that it gets the<br />\nAcademic Council to consider<br />\nthe question of tenure, but<br />\ncautions that \"whenever you<br />\nwant to slow a movement's<br />\nmomentum you send it to a<br />\ncommittee.\"<br />\nBoth Fellman and Peifer<br />\nclaim that the Academic Council<br />\nis \"nervous\" about the attempts<br />\nto change the tenure policy<br />\nwhich Fellman once called the<br />\ncow.\"<br />\n\"sacred<br />\nUniversity's<br />\nPeifer says that Gryder's proposal represents an attempt to<br />\ndiffuse the issue, claiming that<br />\nAcademic Council wants no part<br />\nin a revision of tenure that was<br />\nproposed by students.<br />\nGryder denied that his proposal was made as an attempt to<br />\ndiffuse the issue.

HOOK<br />\nThis Saturday, the Kenan Award<br />\nwinning plays will be presented from 1 to<br />\n3 p.m. and 8 to 11 p.m. in the L/V<br />\nRoom. Below is a brief preview.<br />\n.4 Final Discipline (First Prize<br />\nwinner) was written be James O'Grady.<br />\nand will be performed in the evening. The<br />\nstory is about a troubled family still<br />\nsmarting from the loss of their eldest son<br />\nin Viet Nam. The bitterness of the family<br />\nover his death is expressed through the<br />\nmother's neurosis, the father's frenzied<br />\ncursing. and the remaining son Alan's<br />\nwarped character. While Alan and the<br />\nmother feel that the dead boy died in the<br />\narms of a Vietnamese prostitute, the<br />\nfather insists that he died honorably in<br />\nbattle. The audience doesn't particularly<br />\ncare which is true. Director Harris<br />\nGruman elicits a wonderfully 'eerie<br />\npert orinance from Marc Roudebush<br />\n(Alan) and a sensitive portrayal of an<br />\ninsensitive character from Don Gordon<br />\n(the father). The play is powerful, but the<br />\nending smarts.<br />\nChestbeating (Second Prize winner) by Joe Levine (also shown in the<br />\nevening) tells of two teenage boys. an<br />\nolder sister, and her friend. The boys have<br />\nsexual fantasies about the older girls, who<br />\nhave just left on a double-date with two<br />\npimple-faced bank clerks. While the girls<br />\nare gone. the boys search for creative<br />\nways,to sublimate their sexuality. Granville Greene and Dan Vitale have been<br />\npaired off as the boys, and Janet Goldstein<br />\nand Cindy Stagoff play the hep older gals.<br />\nDirected by Maxine Wasserstein.<br />\nThe Only Play I Ever Did (Tied<br />\nfor the Stephen Don Award) by Toni<br />\nTuzynski (evening), is the story of a<br />\ncouple in the French Provinces. The<br />\nMuradaz and Jessica<br />\ncouple (Rey<br />\nKubzansky) jockey for control over each<br />\nother's minds. Their identities at times<br />\nmystically meld together, and at times<br />\na British backpacker<br />\nswitch. When<br />\n(Bruce McKenzie) stumbles onto the<br />\ncouple's home, he becomes involved in<br />\nthe couple's bizarre sexual power<br />\nstruggle.<br />\nSomething More (Steven Don<br />\n<br />\nAward Winner) by Mike Bruno. The<br />\nrather trite story of a college undergraduate (John Lana) who yearns for<br />\n\"something more\" than the transient<br />\npleasures of drugs and Who concerts<br />\n(more specifically, mountains and<br />\ncountry air) to the annoyance of his<br />\ndepraved girlfriend (Ayala Hecht). The<br />\nplay's two characters are quite twodimensional;: the male college student,<br />\nAndy, is resolute (in a wishy-washy sort<br />\nof way) in his desire to get away from it<br />\nall (\"I'll have to get a leave of absence<br />\nfrom school. . .\" etc.), and persecuted by<br />\nhis girlfriend, Sue, who is very fond oft.,<br />\nthe<br />\ndrugs and Who concerts.

Its<br />\ncult following, while without the momentum of the Rocky Horror Picture Show,<br />\nis certainly established. In part, this may<br />\ncorrespond to the timing of the film's<br />\nrelease in 1972;judging by its themes of<br />\nwar and competition, and the Vietnam<br />\nWar. This, however, does not explain the<br />\n<br />\nNow There's A WoolfOfAnother Color!<br />\nWhat do you do with a classic of<br />\nthe modern theater? How do you stage<br />\nit? How do you revivify it with a new<br />\ninterpretation when your audience is<br />\nlikely to be familiar not only with the<br />\nplay itself (as they would be with Shakespeare), but also with the contemporary<br />\nsetting?<br />\nThese thoughts crossed the reviewer's mind as the lights dimmed for<br />\nthe first act of Who's Afraid of Virginia<br />\nWoolf?, a new production which has its<br />\nfinal three performances this weekend at<br />\nthe Arena Playhouse.<br />\nIn fact, the only novel touch to<br />\nthis staging of Edward Albee's most<br />\nfamous play is instantly clear: his protagonists. George and Martha, are black.<br />\nthe fact of their race, however, ultimately<br />\nlends little either to their own characterizations or to the deeper implications<br />\nof their interaction with the Younger<br />\nCouple. Nick and Honey. Suffice to say<br />\nthat George (John Hargrove) is the same<br />\ndeeply scarred man that he has always<br />\nbeen, and Martha (Penny Demps) is the<br />\n<br />\nsassy self-described Earth Mother we've<br />\nalways known her as. Both take a good<br />\npart of the first act to get in gear, and<br />\nsome of Albee's wittier dialogue in<br />\nlose<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe process, but their performances<br />\nrapidly catch fire and each is in the<br />\nend memorable: the third act is a gem<br />\nof climactic theater, riding on the<br />\nstrengths of these two actors. Martha's<br />\nrevelations to Nick\u2014and to herself\u2014of her<br />\nfeelings for George are beautifully poignant and eminently believable: and<br />\nGeorge's wresting for control of their<br />\ngames (and of the. play) is. breathtaking.<br />\nNick and Honey, the new couple<br />\nwho stop by George and Martha's house<br />\nfor a nightcap and end up staying till<br />\ndawn, are portrayed with suitably fragile<br />\nKansas bravado and prissiness by Scott<br />\nElliott and April Inloes. Inloes' Honey is<br />\nin fact so uncanny in her prim vulnerability as to be definitive, and one ends<br />\nup wishing she didn't have to spend so<br />\nmuch time offstage vomiting up the<br />\ninnumerable brandies we see her imbibe.<br />\nNick is less convincing, at least in his<br />\nearly conversational tangles with George.<br />\nAs_ with George and Martha, his character-<br />\n<br />\n;444<br />\n<br />\nfilm's popularity in recent years, that can<br />\nbest be attributed to its notoriety more<br />\nthan anything else.<br />\nFace it: Pink Flamingos is not<br />\nPolyester.

All of the<br />\ncharacters are somewhat weak in their<br />\npredictability, most notably the aggressive characters of Molly and, to an even<br />\ngreater extent, Adam .The direction of<br />\nKim Penner is adequate, though not<br />\nphenomenal (1001 Fun Things to Do<br />\n;<br />\nWith Balloons)<br />\n<br />\nization grows stronger as the character's<br />\nfacade grows weaker and eventually falls.<br />\nThis is a play to leave one drained<br />\nand panting when it is done right, and so<br />\nit was for this reviewer at the Arena. The<br />\ndirector, Diana Nichols, clearly has<br />\nconfidence in the script as it stands and as<br />\nit has frequently been staged since it was<br />\nwritten some twenty years ago. That<br />\nconfidence is reflected in the individual<br />\nmembers of the cast, and it is warranted.<br />\nThe secret of Who's Afraid of Virginia<br />\nWoolf? is that it still works.

Crackers (Danny Mills), her<br />\ndemented hillbilly-hippie son; Cotton<br />\n(Mary Vivian Pearce), her bleached-blond,<br />\nglamorous, and voyeuristic traveling<br />\ncompanion; and Mama Edie (Edith<br />\nMassey), a 250-pound senior citizen<br />\nwho sits in a playpen dressed in a girdle<br />\nand bra and worships eggs.<br />\n\"The challengers to the title are<br />\nConnie and Raymond Marble (Mink Stole<br />\nand the late David Lochary), a jealous,<br />\npublicity-hungry couple with prepunk red<br />\nand blue hair who sell heroin to inner-city<br />\nelementary school students and kidnap<br />\nhitchhiking girls, impregnate them with<br />\ntheir servant's (Channing Wilroy)semen,<br />\nand sell the babies to lesbian couples.\"<br />\nThe ultimate in sleaze, Pink<br />\nFlamingos captures the essence of trailer<br />\npark life (according to John Waters'<br />\nimagination). The cramped quarters are<br />\nemphasized by the bulk of Mama Edie<br />\nand Divine. The trailer scenes were shot<br />\nin rural Maryland during the winter (note<br />\nthe frozen breaths of air throughout these<br />\nshots), and the Marbles residence was<br />\nactually shot in Waters' home\u2014which I<br />\nplace somewhere on or near Greenmount<br />\nAvenue.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nf4nrowsfofo<br />\nAroWA, 4.14fm<br />\n<br />\nye<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nfftVliftwil'ff01,ft<br />\n<br />\nby Steve Eisenberg<br />\nand<br />\nMichael Fingerhood<br />\nHopkins fans and players stood in disbelief. The<br />\nscoreboard read North Carolina 14\u2014Johns Hopkins 13.<br />\nThe seemingly invincible Blue Jays had lost. For the Tar<br />\nHeel fans in Princeton's Palmer Stadium jubilation<br />\nabounded. The record crowd at 22.100 had just witnessed a thrilling lacrosse match. Fittingly, it had been<br />\nfor the national championship.<br />\nThat was May 30, 1981. Over nine months later,<br />\nthe Jays are ready to renew their drive for five. They'll<br />\nalso have a chance for revenge on April 10, when, for the<br />\nfirst time. they play North Carolina at Homewood Field.<br />\nThe Tar Heels replace Cornell on the schedule.<br />\nSince the inception of the playoffs to determine<br />\nthe national champion. Hopkins has won the championship four times: 1974. 1978, 1979 and 1980. In the<br />\npast seven years, under Coach Henry Ciccarone, the Jays<br />\nsport an 84-11 record. Last year. they were 13-1 overall.<br />\noutscoring opponents 239-114. I lopkins has not lost at<br />\nhome since 1978, when the Jays dropped a 16-11<br />\ndecision to Cornell. They avenged the loss later in that<br />\nseason, beating Conic II 13-8 in the championship game.<br />\nHopkins' last regular season loss was two years ago.<br />\nwhen they were defeated by the Virginia Wahoos 12-8.<br />\nOnce again, they avenged the loss in the championship<br />\ngame, beating Virginia 9-8 in double overtime.<br />\nDespite not winning the championship, last<br />\nyear's Blue Jay squad was probably one of the best<br />\nteams Hopkins has ever had. The North Carolina defeat<br />\nbroke a twenty-two game winning streak that stretched<br />\nover two seasons. The Jav offensive machine, operated<br />\nmainly by Jeff Cook and Brendan Schneck. who graduated, scored over twenty goals three times, shell-shocking the goalies of Yale. Washington and Towson with 25.<br />\n14 and 24 goals. respectively. Meanwhile, the steadfast<br />\nHopkins defense allowed opponems to reach double<br />\nilgures only two times during the regular season. One of<br />\nthose games was a 24-11 victory over Washington and<br />\nthe other Was a 15-13 win over Virginia.<br />\nThis season, for the first time, the Jays will be<br />\nplaying their home games on Astro-Turf. According to<br />\nCoach Ciccarone. the artificial surface will make it easier<br />\nto pick up ground balls. In addition, goalies will face<br />\nless uncertainty on bounce shots. On defense, clears<br />\ncan be facilitated using bounce passes. Unfortunately,<br />\nplayers will have to worry constantly about skin abrasions from the artifical surface.<br />\nThis year's lacrosse team is not as deep as it has<br />\nbeen in the past. Coach Ciccarone will have to rely a<br />\ngreat deal on younger, less experienced players. Nevertheless.- the Jays still have a powerful attack and two<br />\nexcellent midfield units. Their front line defense should<br />\nalso be solid.<br />\nOn attack. the Jays will be led by senior Jeff<br />\nCook. from Baltimore. The list of accolades won by<br />\nCook last year includes the Jack Turnbull Memorial<br />\nAward for the best attackman, most valuable player in<br />\nthe championship game, first team All-American, and<br />\nthe Lt. Ray 111011 Linters Memorial Award for the outstanding player in Division L It was the third straight<br />\nyear a Hopkins player was voted the outstanding player<br />\nin Division I. Mark Greenberg won the award in 1979<br />\nand Brendan Schneck won in 1980.<br />\nLast season. Cook led the Jays in scoring with 52<br />\ngoals and 28 assists. Ile was second in tlie nation in<br />\ngoals, behind Massachusetts at ackman Jim Weller, who<br />\nhad 62 goals, and sixth in the nation in assists. He<br />\nscored on fifty percent of his shots. In an amazing<br />\ndisplay. Cook scored an incredible six goals in the<br />\nchampionship game against North Carolina. Coach<br />\nCiccarone commented. \"He's as good as anybody has<br />\never been in going to the goal.\" He added.\"Teams will<br />\nbe trying to deny him the ball.\"<br />\nIt opposing defenders start keying on Cook,look<br />\nfor Peter Scott to score a lot of goals. Scott, a sophomore, was the Jays sixth leading scorer last season, with<br />\n14 goals and 6 assists. He had an outstanding fall season,<br />\nscoring 7 goals in the Hopkins 14-13 loss to Team<br />\n<br />\nCanada. Don't be surprised if he explodes with a similar<br />\nfeat during the season.<br />\nGary Benninghoff, Mike Donnelly and Rob Lord<br />\nshould also provide scoring punch at the attack spot.<br />\nBenninghoff, a junior, spent the winter playing varsity<br />\nbasketball. He had 9 goals and 1 assist last season,<br />\ntaking only 18 shots. Benninghoff is excellent on the<br />\ncrease.Donnelly. fourth on the team in scoring last year,<br />\ntallied 19 goals and 10 assists. He will be playing for<br />\nTeam Canada in the World Games. In a fall exhibition<br />\ngame. Donnelly, playing for Team Canada, scored one<br />\ngoal against his present teammates. Rob Lord, a junior<br />\nfrom Westminster. Maryland, sat out last season with a<br />\nknee injury.<br />\nDespite the loss of Brendan Schneck, the Blue<br />\nJays still have a strong and potentially explosive midfield. Leadership and scoring will be provided by Henry<br />\nCiccarone, Jr., who had 16 goals and 12 assists in 1981.<br />\nCiccarone, a junior, was a third team All-American. On<br />\nthe same midfield corps as Ciccarone will be Bill Cantelli<br />\nand John Krumenacker. Cantelli, a junior from Valley<br />\nStream, New York, blossomed toward the end of last<br />\nseason. He finished with 8 goals and 2 assists. In the<br />\nchampionship game against North Carolina, Cantelli<br />\nscored 1 goal. Krumenacker. a freshman from Farmingdale, New York, had an excellent fall season. He is the<br />\nonly freshman to crack the starting lineup.<br />\nThe second midfield corps, to be used especially<br />\nin the man-up situations, will consist of Joe Ciletti, Jeff<br />\nKendall and either Rich Glancy, Willy Odenthal or Mike<br />\nLynch. Ciletti and Kendall, according :o Coach Ciccarone, \"will take more offensive initiative this season.\"<br />\nCiletti, a senior from Baltimore, had 4 goals and 4<br />\nasssists a year ago, while Kendall, a junior from Severna<br />\nPark. Maryland. had 5 goals and 8 assists. Lynch, a<br />\njunior, who had 1 assist last season, appears to have the<br />\nnod for the third position. However. Coach Ciccarone<br />\nhas high regard for Glancy and Odenthal, both sophomores. Last year, Odenthal posted 2 goals and 2 assists,<br />\nwhile Glancy tallied 3 goals and 2 assists. Glancy will<br />\nalso be a key face-off man for the Jays, along with<br />\nfreshmen Greg Matthews, Franklin Square,N.Y. and Lee<br />\nDavidson. Annapolis, Maryland.<br />\nDavidson played<br />\nimpressively in a scrimmage against Penn two weeks ago.<br />\nLast year, the Jays were anything but dominating in<br />\nface-offs. winning 206 and losing 198. Last. season<br />\nmarked the return of the face-off after each goal. The<br />\nyear before, the team scored upon automatically received possession of the ball.<br />\nDefenders Jim Esposito. Steve Dubin, Guy<br />\nMattriciani and Brian Baumgardner will be utilized<br />\nby Coach Ciccarone as midfielders in man-down situations. Last season, the Jays man-down defense allowed<br />\nonly 27 goals, killing a penalty seventy percent of the<br />\ntime. Esposito, a junior from Uniondale. New York has<br />\nlooked very good this spring and should see a great deal<br />\nof action. He is a strong defender along the crease.<br />\nBaumgardner, who had 1 goal last year, was cited by<br />\nCoach i Ciccarone as \"one of the most improved players.\"<br />\nMattriciani is an impressive freshman from Boys Latin in<br />\nBaltimore<br />\nFn.ling<br />\nout the midfield are John Stahl and John<br />\nPalazzo. Stahl, a freshman from Calvert Hall, is an<br />\nexcellent shooter, but he needs more experience. Palazzo, a junior, who tallied 3 goals and 1 assist in 1981, is<br />\npresently nursing an injury.<br />\nIn addition to Esposito, the Jays solid front line<br />\ndefense will consist of Dave Black, Marty Bergin and Has<br />\nFranklin. Black, a four year starter, is the captain of the<br />\nteam. The leader on defense. Black was an honorable<br />\nmention All-American last year. Bergin is a junior<br />\nfrom Port Washington. New York. Coach Ciccarone,<br />\nthinks highly of Bergin and feels \"he has the ability to<br />\nbe an outstanding defenseman.\" Franklin. a talented<br />\njunior. has also played varsity football and wrestled. He<br />\nis tough along the crease.<br />\nOnce again, the nets will be protected by goalie<br />\nBrian Holman. Holman. a junior from Annapolis.<br />\nMaryland, took over the goal position last season,<br />\nreplacing All-American Mike Federico. Holman gave up<br />\nonly 93 goals in 1981, coming up with 139 saves. He<br />\nwas an honorable mention All-American. Backing up<br />\nHolman will be Larry Quinn, a freshman from Levittown, New York. Quinn had an excellent fall season and<br />\naccording to Coach Ciccarone, is not far behind Holman<br />\nin development.<br />\n<br />\nThe drive for five NCAA championships continues:<br />\nYALE: Sat., March 13 at 2:00 p.m. at Homewood Field.<br />\nThe Blue Jays scored nine goals during last year's<br />\ngame (25-6) before the Elis touched the ball. So it's no<br />\nsurprise that all Coach Waldvogel wants to do is \"survive\" when lie brings his team to Hopkins. \"The main<br />\nthing that I want to control this year is the awesome<br />\ntransition game. If we can get control of a situation<br />\nthen we could possibly capitalize on something. But<br />\nwith Hopkins always being known for its midfield, it<br />\nwon't be easy.\"<br />\n<br />\nPeter Scott \"may be the sleeper of the season \".<br />\nThe second year coach has a young team which<br />\nisn't of the same caliber as last year's squad. A greater<br />\noutput of goals from the midfield and more consistent<br />\ndefense will be needed to improve their 1981 record of<br />\n6-8. The top returning player is honorable mention<br />\nAll-American Mike Devlon (20 goals, 29 assists, 49<br />\npoints). Attacker Dave Ohl (19-9-28) and midfielder<br />\nBrian Mongillo (15-6-21) are the other offensive threats.<br />\nTom Conroy, Rob Anderson, and goalie Jon Bulkeley<br />\nwill anchor the defense.<br />\nThe rebuilding Flies, who played Duke Tuesday<br />\nin their season opener, will challenge Cornell and Princeton for the Ivy title.<br />\nPrediction: 21-5.<br />\nHA RV A RD: Sat., March 20 at 2:00 p.m. at Homewood<br />\n<br />\nTwo years ago Hopkins met Harvard in the<br />\nplayoffs with the Blue Jays winning 16-12. Last year<br />\nthe Jays rolled over the Crimson \u2022<br />\n17-4, at Manhasset (L.I.) High School. \"This year we'll be playing<br />\nour season opener at Homewood,\" says Coach Scalese.<br />\n\"It's like playing at Notre Dame for football and playing<br />\nill Pauli Pavilion for basketball. The Lacrosse Hall of<br />\nFame is only a hundred yards away.\"<br />\nSeven freshmen will be joining 21 returning<br />\nlettermen in hopes of improving their sixth place finish<br />\n(4-8) in the Ivy League. Norm Forbush (19-4-23) and J.<br />\nJ. Nullet (15-2-17) will be leading the attack. The return<br />\nof 1980 All-American attackman Brendan Meagher<br />\n(injured last year) will also help the scoring punch. With<br />\nreturning starters Rich Doyle and Mike Davis, the<br />\nmidfield appears solid.<br />\nWhen playing Hopkins, \"We do things we like to<br />\ndo and take away the things that they like to do,\" says<br />\nScalese. \"We'll slow things down or we'll play faster. It<br />\nall depends.<br />\n\"The guys we'll be paying close attention to are<br />\nJeff Cook, Krumenacker and Dressell. But at least we<br />\nwon't have to worry about Dressell until next year.\"<br />\nDressell, the high school player of the year in Maryland<br />\nlast year, came to Hopkins from Harvard as a second<br />\nsemester freshman and is ineligible for the present season<br />\nalthough he will practice with the team apd will play for<br />\n<br />\n\fforFl<br />\nthe Mt.

Five key starters have graduated although last year's leading scorer, junior Paul<br />\nHollis (15-18-33) and the midfield trio of Steve Delligatti (13-8-21), Rip Wilson and Mike Neary are returning.

Once again it will<br />\nbe a young team: 7 of the 9<br />\nstarters, including the designated<br />\nhitter, are non-seniors.<br />\nThe<br />\ngreatest strength of the team<br />\nshould be in its double play<br />\ncombination. Senior Bill Stromberg, the team's captain, returns<br />\nat shortstop. Stromberg batted<br />\n.333 last year. He has stolen 56<br />\nbases in 57 attempts over the<br />\npast 2 years.

The return of Steve<br />\nHand, a senior who did not play<br />\nlast year, should be a very<br />\nimportant addition to the team.<br />\nHe is the Jays only true \"power<br />\npitcher.\" Three freshman pitchers, righties Jack Flynn and Mike<br />\nRosen, along with southpaw<br />\nTodd Lancaster, should hopefully give the team better<br />\npitching depth this year.<br />\nThere is great depth at first<br />\nbase, with the three players used<br />\nlast year, Bob Martino, Rusty<br />\nRay, and Doug Gneiser all<br />\nreturning.<br />\nBut the loss of<br />\ncatcher Bruce Kane, a four year<br />\nstarter and last season's MAC<br />\nmost valuable player, should<br />\nhurt the team. Sophomore Bill<br />\nMiller, last year's back-up to<br />\nKane, and Bobby Rodriquez will<br />\nbe the two catchers on this<br />\nyear's squad. Coach Bob Babb is<br />\nhoping someone can \"take<br />\ncharge of the field\" and fill<br />\nthe hole left by Kane.

For the others it was just a<br />\nside job.\" \"We had never had a<br />\nfull-tune tennis or basketball<br />\ncoach before,\" said Fowler,<br />\n\"and that makes all the difference in the world.\"<br />\nConsider the results. The<br />\ntennis team, winless only three<br />\nyears ago, captured the MAC<br />\nSouthern Division with a 10-2<br />\nrecord and went on to win a<br />\nplay(iff against the Northern<br />\nDivision champion. the first five<br />\nwomen all posted very impressive win-loss ratios. The results<br />\nof the basketball team were not<br />\nas spectacular, but the team did<br />\nimporve from 4-13 last year to<br />\n8-11, losing one in overtime and<br />\ntwo by a field goal or less.<br />\n\"I think one thing I've given<br />\nto teams this year is a desire to<br />\nwin,\" said Fowler. \"If you have<br />\na team that has a history of<br />\nlosing, it's good to have a change<br />\nin coach, a change in lots of<br />\nthings.

Dzura.<br />\nI have no trouble with the<br />\nidea<br />\ndual-existence-of-man<br />\n(\"Although a creature of nature.<br />\nHaiti also has ,an existence<br />\noutside' nature.'.). It is:after all,<br />\n<br />\nsubjective, as is the concept of<br />\ngod. But when Mr. Dzura starts<br />\nin with the \"doctrine of evolution.\" he's distorting facts. Evolution is not a doctrine but a<br />\ncomplex yet coordinated set of<br />\nobservations from<br />\nscientific<br />\nwhich are drawn various scientific (i.e.. subject to revision on<br />\nthe basis of empirical evidence)<br />\ntheories. Dispute among evolutionists concerns interpretation<br />\nof facts. not application of<br />\ndogma.<br />\nMr. Dzura goes on to discuss<br />\nthe science/spirit dichotomy<br />\n,(the conflict between scientific<br />\nmethod and gut feelings). That's<br />\nokay. hut why need there be<br />\nsuch a dichotomy'? I submit<br />\nthat our concept of the soul,<br />\nspirit or whatever as separate<br />\nfrom \"petty\" material existence<br />\nis hogwash, and is one symptom<br />\nof a prevalent misconception of<br />\nthe universe and our place in it<br />\n(heavy stuff, ain't it?): viz., that<br />\nwe are all separate things enclosed neatly (or perhaps not<br />\nso neatly) in bags of skin. This<br />\ncor.cept requires definition of us<br />\nas distinct from our environment. and as any science major<br />\nknows (and any humanities<br />\nmajor is intelligent enough to<br />\nfigure out). a thing cannot he<br />\nadequately defined without reference to its environment. An<br />\norganism is incapable of survivMg in an environment substantially different from its native<br />\none.

Well. Mr. Dzura<br />\nclaims in his last paragraph<br />\nthat \"evolution in the biosphere<br />\nhas stopped.\" You can try to<br />\nreconcile evolution with your<br />\nreligious beliefs if you want to,<br />\nMr. Dzura-hut . where's .vour<br />\nevidence that evolution has<br />\nstopped'?

The<br />\nbuildings will be to the west and<br />\nnorth of Clark Dormitory. The<br />\nnew buildings will be connected<br />\nat ground level by a dining<br />\nfacility which would seat 400<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe new buildings will have<br /><br />\nsingle and double bedrooms.<br />\nEvery two bedrooms would<br />\nshare a toilet and shower facility<br />\nso that there will effectively be<br />\nthree and four person suites.<br />\nIn addition, eight other double<br />\nbedrooms will have private bathrooms.<br />\nEach building will have<br />\nsome lounge space and the<br />\nnorthern building will have an<br />\nadditional 1500 square feet of<br />\ncommon space.

Jeffrey<br />\ncomplied with the request.<br />\nPersuant to the SAC constitution which gives the treasurer.<br />\npower to \"freeze the funds and<br />\nassets of any organization acting<br />\nirresponsibly, pending review by<br />\nthe Executive Board,\" the Executive Board reviewed Jeffrey's<br />\naction at its regular Tuesday<br /><br />\nmorning meeting.<br />\nAt that meeting Student<br />\nCouncil president Chuck Peifer<br />\nasked how freezing News-Lettcr<br />\nfunds would ensure a fair election. Jeffrey responded that<br />\ncont. on P. 22<br /><br />\nexisting dining facilities will be<br />\nconverted into common space.<br />\nThere are no specific plans on<br />\nhow that will proceed.<br />\nPeifer complained about the<br />\nlack of student involvement with<br />\nthe plans. \"This is student<br />\nhousing, and we [the Student<br />\nCouncil] represent students,\"<br />\nhe said. \"The University did a<br />\ndamn poor job in getting students involved in this project.\"<br />\nPeifer said that the plan \"is<br />\nnot the best,\" but felt that<br />\n\"anything is a relief\" considering<br />\nthe existing dormitories. He is<br />\ndisappointed that ihe plan does<br />\nnot concentrate student life in<br />\nthe northern part of campus by<br />\nproviding a greater amount of<br />\nnew housing. He also feels that<br />\nthe plan does not vastly increase<br />\nthe quality of housing.

Mom<br />\nisn't here and we don't have a<br />\nfamily physician, so it usually<br />\nboils down to a choice between<br />\nthe University Health Services<br />\nand the emergency room at the<br />\nnearest hospital.

However, many<br />\npeople choose to err on the side<br />\nof safety, and go to the hospital,<br />\nwhen they are unsure of what<br />\nails them. Often this is an<br />\nunnecessary choice.<br />\n\"About 85 percent of the<br />\npeople waiting in emergency<br />\nrooms shouldn't be there,\" says<br />\nJoan Rehner, clinic/nursing administrator for University Health<br />\nServices at JHU. \"A lot of<br />\nstudents feel they won't be able<br />\nto get enough help with our<br />\non-call service so they take it<br />\nupon themselves to go to an<br />\nemergency room without seeing<br />\nus.\"<br />\nRehner says that the student's attitude is often \"I don't<br />\nhave time to be sick,\" and that<br />\nstudents often opt for the<br />\nemergency room for that reason.<br />\n\"What a student considers<br />\nsevere, and what might actually<br />\nhe severe,are often two different<br />\nthings.

HOOK<br />\nThis Saturday, the Kenan Award<br />\nwinning plays will be presented from 1 to<br />\n3 p.m. and 8 to 11 p.m. in the L/V<br />\nRoom. Below is a brief preview.<br />\n.4 Final Discipline (First Prize<br />\nwinner) was written be James O'Grady.<br />\nand will be performed in the evening. The<br />\nstory is about a troubled family still<br />\nsmarting from the loss of their eldest son<br />\nin Viet Nam. The bitterness of the family<br />\nover his death is expressed through the<br />\nmother's neurosis, the father's frenzied<br />\ncursing. and the remaining son Alan's<br />\nwarped character. While Alan and the<br />\nmother feel that the dead boy died in the<br />\narms of a Vietnamese prostitute, the<br />\nfather insists that he died honorably in<br />\nbattle. The audience doesn't particularly<br />\ncare which is true. Director Harris<br />\nGruman elicits a wonderfully 'eerie<br />\npert orinance from Marc Roudebush<br />\n(Alan) and a sensitive portrayal of an<br />\ninsensitive character from Don Gordon<br />\n(the father). The play is powerful, but the<br />\nending smarts.<br />\nChestbeating (Second Prize winner) by Joe Levine (also shown in the<br />\nevening) tells of two teenage boys. an<br />\nolder sister, and her friend. The boys have<br />\nsexual fantasies about the older girls, who<br />\nhave just left on a double-date with two<br />\npimple-faced bank clerks. While the girls<br />\nare gone. the boys search for creative<br />\nways,to sublimate their sexuality. Granville Greene and Dan Vitale have been<br />\npaired off as the boys, and Janet Goldstein<br />\nand Cindy Stagoff play the hep older gals.<br />\nDirected by Maxine Wasserstein.<br />\nThe Only Play I Ever Did (Tied<br />\nfor the Stephen Don Award) by Toni<br />\nTuzynski (evening), is the story of a<br />\ncouple in the French Provinces. The<br />\nMuradaz and Jessica<br />\ncouple (Rey<br />\nKubzansky) jockey for control over each<br />\nother's minds. Their identities at times<br />\nmystically meld together, and at times<br />\na British backpacker<br />\nswitch. When<br />\n(Bruce McKenzie) stumbles onto the<br />\ncouple's home, he becomes involved in<br />\nthe couple's bizarre sexual power<br />\nstruggle.<br />\nSomething More (Steven Don<br /><br />\nAward Winner) by Mike Bruno. The<br />\nrather trite story of a college undergraduate (John Lana) who yearns for<br />\n\"something more\" than the transient<br />\npleasures of drugs and Who concerts<br />\n(more specifically, mountains and<br />\ncountry air) to the annoyance of his<br />\ndepraved girlfriend (Ayala Hecht). The<br />\nplay's two characters are quite twodimensional;: the male college student,<br />\nAndy, is resolute (in a wishy-washy sort<br />\nof way) in his desire to get away from it<br />\nall (\"I'll have to get a leave of absence<br />\nfrom school. . .\" etc.), and persecuted by<br />\nhis girlfriend, Sue, who is very fond oft.,<br />\nthe<br />\ndrugs and Who concerts.

Rob Sparky. played by Malcolm<br /><br />\n[,/,\u2018IR ir<br />\nTroubled Flamingos<br />\nBY BOSCOE THE CINEASTE<br /><br />\nPink Flamingos is probably the<br />\nbest known of John Waters' films. Its<br />\ncult following, while without the momentum of the Rocky Horror Picture Show,<br />\nis certainly established. In part, this may<br />\ncorrespond to the timing of the film's<br />\nrelease in 1972;judging by its themes of<br />\nwar and competition, and the Vietnam<br />\nWar. This, however, does not explain the<br /><br />\nNow There's A WoolfOfAnother Color!<br />\nWhat do you do with a classic of<br />\nthe modern theater? How do you stage<br />\nit? How do you revivify it with a new<br />\ninterpretation when your audience is<br />\nlikely to be familiar not only with the<br />\nplay itself (as they would be with Shakespeare), but also with the contemporary<br />\nsetting?<br />\nThese thoughts crossed the reviewer's mind as the lights dimmed for<br />\nthe first act of Who's Afraid of Virginia<br />\nWoolf?, a new production which has its<br />\nfinal three performances this weekend at<br />\nthe Arena Playhouse.<br />\nIn fact, the only novel touch to<br />\nthis staging of Edward Albee's most<br />\nfamous play is instantly clear: his protagonists. George and Martha, are black.<br />\nthe fact of their race, however, ultimately<br />\nlends little either to their own characterizations or to the deeper implications<br />\nof their interaction with the Younger<br />\nCouple. Nick and Honey. Suffice to say<br />\nthat George (John Hargrove) is the same<br />\ndeeply scarred man that he has always<br />\nbeen, and Martha (Penny Demps) is the<br /><br />\nsassy self-described Earth Mother we've<br />\nalways known her as. Both take a good<br />\npart of the first act to get in gear, and<br />\nsome of Albee's wittier dialogue in<br />\nlose<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe process, but their performances<br />\nrapidly catch fire and each is in the<br />\nend memorable: the third act is a gem<br />\nof climactic theater, riding on the<br />\nstrengths of these two actors. Martha's<br />\nrevelations to Nick\u2014and to herself\u2014of her<br />\nfeelings for George are beautifully poignant and eminently believable: and<br />\nGeorge's wresting for control of their<br />\ngames (and of the. play) is. breathtaking.<br />\nNick and Honey, the new couple<br />\nwho stop by George and Martha's house<br />\nfor a nightcap and end up staying till<br />\ndawn, are portrayed with suitably fragile<br />\nKansas bravado and prissiness by Scott<br />\nElliott and April Inloes. Inloes' Honey is<br />\nin fact so uncanny in her prim vulnerability as to be definitive, and one ends<br />\nup wishing she didn't have to spend so<br />\nmuch time offstage vomiting up the<br />\ninnumerable brandies we see her imbibe.<br />\nNick is less convincing, at least in his<br />\nearly conversational tangles with George.<br />\nAs_ with George and Martha, his character-<br /><br />\n;444<br /><br />\nfilm's popularity in recent years, that can<br />\nbest be attributed to its notoriety more<br />\nthan anything else.<br />\nFace it: Pink Flamingos is not<br />\nPolyester. The latter had an astronomically larger budget and eight more years<br />\nworth of technical experience behind it.<br />\nPink Flamingos instead of a more recent<br />\nproduction like Reds? Shit. Not an<br />\nexpletitive, just shit. The answer is the<br />\nshit-eating scene. On a lesser note, the<br />\nsinging asshole.

Crackers (Danny Mills), her<br />\ndemented hillbilly-hippie son; Cotton<br />\n(Mary Vivian Pearce), her bleached-blond,<br />\nglamorous, and voyeuristic traveling<br />\ncompanion; and Mama Edie (Edith<br />\nMassey), a 250-pound senior citizen<br />\nwho sits in a playpen dressed in a girdle<br />\nand bra and worships eggs.<br />\n\"The challengers to the title are<br />\nConnie and Raymond Marble (Mink Stole<br />\nand the late David Lochary), a jealous,<br />\npublicity-hungry couple with prepunk red<br />\nand blue hair who sell heroin to inner-city<br />\nelementary school students and kidnap<br />\nhitchhiking girls, impregnate them with<br />\ntheir servant's (Channing Wilroy)semen,<br />\nand sell the babies to lesbian couples.\"<br />\nThe ultimate in sleaze, Pink<br />\nFlamingos captures the essence of trailer<br />\npark life (according to John Waters'<br />\nimagination). The cramped quarters are<br />\nemphasized by the bulk of Mama Edie<br />\nand Divine.

The<br />\nscoreboard read North Carolina 14\u2014Johns Hopkins 13.<br />\nThe seemingly invincible Blue Jays had lost. For the Tar<br />\nHeel fans in Princeton's Palmer Stadium jubilation<br />\nabounded. The record crowd at 22.100 had just witnessed a thrilling lacrosse match. Fittingly, it had been<br />\nfor the national championship.<br />\nThat was May 30, 1981. Over nine months later,<br />\nthe Jays are ready to renew their drive for five. They'll<br />\nalso have a chance for revenge on April 10, when, for the<br />\nfirst time. they play North Carolina at Homewood Field.<br />\nThe Tar Heels replace Cornell on the schedule.<br />\nSince the inception of the playoffs to determine<br />\nthe national champion. Hopkins has won the championship four times: 1974. 1978, 1979 and 1980. In the<br />\npast seven years, under Coach Henry Ciccarone, the Jays<br />\nsport an 84-11 record. Last year. they were 13-1 overall.<br />\noutscoring opponents 239-114. I lopkins has not lost at<br />\nhome since 1978, when the Jays dropped a 16-11<br />\ndecision to Cornell. They avenged the loss later in that<br />\nseason, beating Conic II 13-8 in the championship game.<br />\nHopkins' last regular season loss was two years ago.<br />\nwhen they were defeated by the Virginia Wahoos 12-8.<br />\nOnce again, they avenged the loss in the championship<br />\ngame, beating Virginia 9-8 in double overtime.<br />\nDespite not winning the championship, last<br />\nyear's Blue Jay squad was probably one of the best<br />\nteams Hopkins has ever had. The North Carolina defeat<br />\nbroke a twenty-two game winning streak that stretched<br />\nover two seasons. The Jav offensive machine, operated<br />\nmainly by Jeff Cook and Brendan Schneck. who graduated, scored over twenty goals three times, shell-shocking the goalies of Yale. Washington and Towson with 25.<br />\n14 and 24 goals. respectively. Meanwhile, the steadfast<br />\nHopkins defense allowed opponems to reach double<br />\nilgures only two times during the regular season. One of<br />\nthose games was a 24-11 victory over Washington and<br />\nthe other Was a 15-13 win over Virginia.<br />\nThis season, for the first time, the Jays will be<br />\nplaying their home games on Astro-Turf. According to<br />\nCoach Ciccarone. the artificial surface will make it easier<br />\nto pick up ground balls. In addition, goalies will face<br />\nless uncertainty on bounce shots. On defense, clears<br />\ncan be facilitated using bounce passes. Unfortunately,<br />\nplayers will have to worry constantly about skin abrasions from the artifical surface.<br />\nThis year's lacrosse team is not as deep as it has<br />\nbeen in the past. Coach Ciccarone will have to rely a<br />\ngreat deal on younger, less experienced players. Nevertheless.- the Jays still have a powerful attack and two<br />\nexcellent midfield units. Their front line defense should<br />\nalso be solid.<br />\nOn attack. the Jays will be led by senior Jeff<br />\nCook. from Baltimore. The list of accolades won by<br />\nCook last year includes the Jack Turnbull Memorial<br />\nAward for the best attackman, most valuable player in<br />\nthe championship game, first team All-American, and<br />\nthe Lt. Ray 111011 Linters Memorial Award for the outstanding player in Division L It was the third straight<br />\nyear a Hopkins player was voted the outstanding player<br />\nin Division I. Mark Greenberg won the award in 1979<br />\nand Brendan Schneck won in 1980.<br />\nLast season. Cook led the Jays in scoring with 52<br />\ngoals and 28 assists. Ile was second in tlie nation in<br />\ngoals, behind Massachusetts at ackman Jim Weller, who<br />\nhad 62 goals, and sixth in the nation in assists. He<br />\nscored on fifty percent of his shots. In an amazing<br />\ndisplay. Cook scored an incredible six goals in the<br />\nchampionship game against North Carolina. Coach<br />\nCiccarone commented. \"He's as good as anybody has<br />\never been in going to the goal.\" He added.\"Teams will<br />\nbe trying to deny him the ball.\"<br />\nIt opposing defenders start keying on Cook,look<br />\nfor Peter Scott to score a lot of goals. Scott, a sophomore, was the Jays sixth leading scorer last season, with<br />\n14 goals and 6 assists. He had an outstanding fall season,<br />\nscoring 7 goals in the Hopkins 14-13 loss to Team<br /><br />\nCanada. Don't be surprised if he explodes with a similar<br />\nfeat during the season.<br />\nGary Benninghoff, Mike Donnelly and Rob Lord<br />\nshould also provide scoring punch at the attack spot.<br />\nBenninghoff, a junior, spent the winter playing varsity<br />\nbasketball. He had 9 goals and 1 assist last season,<br />\ntaking only 18 shots. Benninghoff is excellent on the<br />\ncrease.Donnelly. fourth on the team in scoring last year,<br />\ntallied 19 goals and 10 assists. He will be playing for<br />\nTeam Canada in the World Games. In a fall exhibition<br />\ngame. Donnelly, playing for Team Canada, scored one<br />\ngoal against his present teammates. Rob Lord, a junior<br />\nfrom Westminster. Maryland, sat out last season with a<br />\nknee injury.<br />\nDespite the loss of Brendan Schneck, the Blue<br />\nJays still have a strong and potentially explosive midfield. Leadership and scoring will be provided by Henry<br />\nCiccarone, Jr., who had 16 goals and 12 assists in 1981.<br />\nCiccarone, a junior, was a third team All-American. On<br />\nthe same midfield corps as Ciccarone will be Bill Cantelli<br />\nand John Krumenacker. Cantelli, a junior from Valley<br />\nStream, New York, blossomed toward the end of last<br />\nseason. He finished with 8 goals and 2 assists. In the<br />\nchampionship game against North Carolina, Cantelli<br />\nscored 1 goal. Krumenacker. a freshman from Farmingdale, New York, had an excellent fall season. He is the<br />\nonly freshman to crack the starting lineup.<br />\nThe second midfield corps, to be used especially<br />\nin the man-up situations, will consist of Joe Ciletti, Jeff<br />\nKendall and either Rich Glancy, Willy Odenthal or Mike<br />\nLynch. Ciletti and Kendall, according :o Coach Ciccarone, \"will take more offensive initiative this season.\"<br />\nCiletti, a senior from Baltimore, had 4 goals and 4<br />\nasssists a year ago, while Kendall, a junior from Severna<br />\nPark. Maryland. had 5 goals and 8 assists. Lynch, a<br />\njunior, who had 1 assist last season, appears to have the<br />\nnod for the third position. However. Coach Ciccarone<br />\nhas high regard for Glancy and Odenthal, both sophomores. Last year, Odenthal posted 2 goals and 2 assists,<br />\nwhile Glancy tallied 3 goals and 2 assists. Glancy will<br />\nalso be a key face-off man for the Jays, along with<br />\nfreshmen Greg Matthews, Franklin Square,N.Y. and Lee<br />\nDavidson. Annapolis, Maryland.<br />\nDavidson played<br />\nimpressively in a scrimmage against Penn two weeks ago.<br />\nLast year, the Jays were anything but dominating in<br />\nface-offs. winning 206 and losing 198. Last. season<br />\nmarked the return of the face-off after each goal. The<br />\nyear before, the team scored upon automatically received possession of the ball.<br />\nDefenders Jim Esposito. Steve Dubin, Guy<br />\nMattriciani and Brian Baumgardner will be utilized<br />\nby Coach Ciccarone as midfielders in man-down situations. Last season, the Jays man-down defense allowed<br />\nonly 27 goals, killing a penalty seventy percent of the<br />\ntime. Esposito, a junior from Uniondale. New York has<br />\nlooked very good this spring and should see a great deal<br />\nof action. He is a strong defender along the crease.<br />\nBaumgardner, who had 1 goal last year, was cited by<br />\nCoach i Ciccarone as \"one of the most improved players.\"<br />\nMattriciani is an impressive freshman from Boys Latin in<br />\nBaltimore<br />\nFn.ling<br />\nout the midfield are John Stahl and John<br />\nPalazzo. Stahl, a freshman from Calvert Hall, is an<br />\nexcellent shooter, but he needs more experience. Palazzo, a junior, who tallied 3 goals and 1 assist in 1981, is<br />\npresently nursing an injury.<br />\nIn addition to Esposito, the Jays solid front line<br />\ndefense will consist of Dave Black, Marty Bergin and Has<br />\nFranklin. Black, a four year starter, is the captain of the<br />\nteam. The leader on defense. Black was an honorable<br />\nmention All-American last year. Bergin is a junior<br />\nfrom Port Washington. New York. Coach Ciccarone,<br />\nthinks highly of Bergin and feels \"he has the ability to<br />\nbe an outstanding defenseman.\" Franklin. a talented<br />\njunior. has also played varsity football and wrestled. He<br />\nis tough along the crease.<br />\nOnce again, the nets will be protected by goalie<br />\nBrian Holman. Holman. a junior from Annapolis.<br />\nMaryland, took over the goal position last season,<br />\nreplacing All-American Mike Federico. Holman gave up<br />\nonly 93 goals in 1981, coming up with 139 saves. He<br />\nwas an honorable mention All-American. Backing up<br />\nHolman will be Larry Quinn, a freshman from Levittown, New York. Quinn had an excellent fall season and<br />\naccording to Coach Ciccarone, is not far behind Holman<br />\nin development.<br /><br />\nThe drive for five NCAA championships continues:<br />\nYALE: Sat., March 13 at 2:00 p.m. at Homewood Field.<br />\nThe Blue Jays scored nine goals during last year's<br />\ngame (25-6) before the Elis touched the ball. So it's no<br />\nsurprise that all Coach Waldvogel wants to do is \"survive\" when lie brings his team to Hopkins. \"The main<br />\nthing that I want to control this year is the awesome<br />\ntransition game. If we can get control of a situation<br />\nthen we could possibly capitalize on something. But<br />\nwith Hopkins always being known for its midfield, it<br />\nwon't be easy.\"<br /><br />\nPeter Scott \"may be the sleeper of the season \".<br />\nThe second year coach has a young team which<br />\nisn't of the same caliber as last year's squad. A greater<br />\noutput of goals from the midfield and more consistent<br />\ndefense will be needed to improve their 1981 record of<br />\n6-8. The top returning player is honorable mention<br />\nAll-American Mike Devlon (20 goals, 29 assists, 49<br />\npoints). Attacker Dave Ohl (19-9-28) and midfielder<br />\nBrian Mongillo (15-6-21) are the other offensive threats.<br />\nTom Conroy, Rob Anderson, and goalie Jon Bulkeley<br />\nwill anchor the defense.<br />\nThe rebuilding Flies, who played Duke Tuesday<br />\nin their season opener, will challenge Cornell and Princeton for the Ivy title.<br />\nPrediction: 21-5.<br />\nHA RV A RD: Sat., March 20 at 2:00 p.m. at Homewood<br /><br />\nTwo years ago Hopkins met Harvard in the<br />\nplayoffs with the Blue Jays winning 16-12.

High School. \"This year we'll be playing<br />\nour season opener at Homewood,\" says Coach Scalese.<br />\n\"It's like playing at Notre Dame for football and playing<br />\nill Pauli Pavilion for basketball. The Lacrosse Hall of<br />\nFame is only a hundred yards away.\"<br />\nSeven freshmen will be joining 21 returning<br />\nlettermen in hopes of improving their sixth place finish<br />\n(4-8) in the Ivy League. Norm Forbush (19-4-23) and J.<br />\nJ. Nullet (15-2-17) will be leading the attack. The return<br />\nof 1980 All-American attackman Brendan Meagher<br />\n(injured last year) will also help the scoring punch. With<br />\nreturning starters Rich Doyle and Mike Davis, the<br />\nmidfield appears solid.<br />\nWhen playing Hopkins, \"We do things we like to<br />\ndo and take away the things that they like to do,\" says<br />\nScalese. \"We'll slow things down or we'll play faster. It<br />\nall depends.<br />\n\"The guys we'll be paying close attention to are<br />\nJeff Cook, Krumenacker and Dressell.

What gives<br />\nadmittedly immoral people like<br /><br />\nlol:s Hogwash<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSorry to bother you again.<br />\nbut I find once more that an<br />\nideological indignity has marred<br />\nthe sacred pages of the NewsLetter. I refer of course to the<br />\n26 Feb. letter entitled \"From<br />\neloquently penned<br />\nAnt kWh<br />\nby one Arthur J. Dzura.<br />\nI have no trouble with the<br />\nidea<br />\ndual-existence-of-man<br />\n(\"Although a creature of nature.<br />\nHaiti also has ,an existence<br />\noutside' nature.'.). It is:after all,<br /><br />\nsubjective, as is the concept of<br />\ngod. But when Mr. Dzura starts<br />\nin with the \"doctrine of evolution.\" he's distorting facts. Evolution is not a doctrine but a<br />\ncomplex yet coordinated set of<br />\nobservations from<br />\nscientific<br />\nwhich are drawn various scientific (i.e.. subject to revision on<br />\nthe basis of empirical evidence)<br />\ntheories. Dispute among evolutionists concerns interpretation<br />\nof facts. not application of<br />\ndogma.<br />\nMr. Dzura goes on to discuss<br />\nthe science/spirit dichotomy<br />\n,(the conflict between scientific<br />\nmethod and gut feelings). That's<br />\nokay. hut why need there be<br />\nsuch a dichotomy'? I submit<br />\nthat our concept of the soul,<br />\nspirit or whatever as separate<br />\nfrom \"petty\" material existence<br />\nis hogwash, and is one symptom<br />\nof a prevalent misconception of<br />\nthe universe and our place in it<br />\n(heavy stuff, ain't it?): viz., that<br />\nwe are all separate things enclosed neatly (or perhaps not<br />\nso neatly) in bags of skin. This<br />\ncor.cept requires definition of us<br />\nas distinct from our environment. and as any science major<br />\nknows (and any humanities<br />\nmajor is intelligent enough to<br />\nfigure out). a thing cannot he<br />\nadequately defined without reference to its environment. An<br />\norganism is incapable of survivMg in an environment substantially different from its native<br />\none. Who is to say where the<br />\norganism ends and where the<br />\nenvironment begins?<br />\nI don't<br /><br />\nwant to get bogged down in an<br />\nintense philosophical discuss;on<br />\nhere, so I'll state my main point:<br />\nthe universe is one thing and we<br />\nand everything else in the<br />\nuniverse are intricately differentiated parts of it-all, in other<br />\nwords, merely different aspects<br />\nof the same thing.<br />\nWhat's all this got to do<br />\nwith evolution? Well. Mr. Dzura<br />\nclaims in his last paragraph<br />\nthat \"evolution in the biosphere<br />\nhas stopped.\" You can try to<br />\nreconcile evolution with your<br />\nreligious beliefs if you want to,<br />\nMr. Dzura-hut . where's .vour<br />\nevidence that evolution has<br />\nstopped'? The evidence, indeed.<br />\nAny<br />\nindicates the opposite.<br />\npublic health official will lell<br />\nyou that evolution is _alive and<br />\nwell: harmful microorganisms<br />\ntenaciously evolve by mutation<br />\nand natural selection into drug.<br />\nresistant strains. (Or is it your<br />\n\"god\" punishing us for our<br />\naudacity in trying to interfere<br />\nwith his Plan by putting these<br />\never-more-virulent organisms on<br />\nthe earth to thwart our efforts?)<br />\nThere are numerous examples of<br />\nevolution around us. As for<br />\nevolution in the \"mental and<br />\nmoral sphere,\" that depends<br />\ncompletely on one's definition<br />\nof mental and moral evoluiion.<br />\nI mean, how do you know<br />\nyou've attained a higher state of<br />\nconsciousness?<br /><br />\nJanet Goldstein<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 21<br />\n*************************************<br /><br />\nPRE MEDS!<br /><br />\nI NEW YORK<br /><br />\nSophomores,Juniors:<br /><br />\nFOR $14<br /><br />\nAlpha Epsilon Delta,<br />\nthe Premedical Honor Society, 4is now accepting applications in<br />\nHomewood House<br />\nfor membership<br /><br />\n$14 Each way<br />\non the Spring Break Special<br />\n$28 Roundtrip<br />\n* Leaving:<br /><br />\nEveryone(Esp.Juniors):<br />\nOffice hours in<br />\nHomewood House<br />\n12-2<br />\nMondays<br />\nWednesdays 12-1<br /><br />\nGoing to:<br /><br />\n* Returning:<br /><br />\nSaturday, March 20,at 10:30 AM<br />\nGarland Hall, NU Campus<br />\nPenn Station, Port Authority,<br />\nNew York City<br />\nSunday, March 28 at 2:00 PM<br />\nFrom Penn Station to Hopkins Campus<br /><br />\nIF INTERESTED:<br />\nCall 243-3017 or write Box 2025<br />\nPatrick McGuinness<br /><br />\nLet us help you<br />\nwith your questions.<br /><br />\nTravelling on comfortable coaches *<br />\nseats are very limited<br />\n*************************************<br /><br />\nCareer Advising Seminar on<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nt<br />\nPresident<br />\nVice-President<br />\nSecretary<br />\nTreasurer<br />\n3Representatives<br /><br />\nCLASS<br /><br />\nHEALTH PROFESSIONS<br /><br />\nOFFICES<br /><br />\nThursday, March 18<br />\nConf.
