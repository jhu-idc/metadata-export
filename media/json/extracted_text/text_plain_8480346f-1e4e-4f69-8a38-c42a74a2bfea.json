Our Team Plays a Whirlwind Game that Rushes<br />\nTheir Annapolis Opponents off Their Feet. A<br />\nRecord Crowd of 1000 Sees the Game.<br />\nStollenwerck Captain for 1910.<br />\n\"Oh where, oh where are the soldier boys,<br />\nOh where, oh where can they be?\"<br />\n-0-<br />\n<br />\nt.<br />\n<br />\nn-<br />\n<br />\n12.<br />\n<br />\n12.<br />\n<br />\nTheir widely touted team\u2014that was<br />\nrunning up forty and sixty-odd to<br />\nnothing scores and held Navy and<br />\nVirginia down to the narrowest of<br />\nmargins\u2014that very self same wonderful team is buried eighteen feet<br />\ndeep \"in the cold, cold ground.\" The<br />\nwildest dreams of the most enthusiastic Hopkins rooter were as nothing compared to the result, for the<br />\nmost sanguine optimist dared not<br />\nhope that we would send the orange<br />\nand black team back to Annapolis<br />\nwithout its having scored. On parer the best judges figured out that<br />\nSt. John's would probably score with<br />\nat least one goal from the field and<br />\nvery possibly a touchdown within the<br />\nfirst twenty minutes of play and in<br />\nthe second half they gave Hopkins<br />\ntwo touchdowns and possibly a drop<br />\nfrom Stollenwerck. All of which<br />\nmerely goes to show the futility of<br />\n\"dope,\" for Hopkins got their two<br />\ntouchdowns, one in each half, and<br />\n.<br />\ntwo field goals, while the St. John's<br />\nteam only got within striking distance once during the entire seventy<br />\nminutes, and then failed miserably<br />\nin their attempt to score.<br />\nSt. John's was outplayed at every<br />\npoint of the game with the possible<br />\nexception of punting. In fact, it was<br />\ndue largely to the clever booting of<br />\nBrown, who was called upon time<br />\nand time again, that the score did<br />\nriot soar higher in our favor. But<br />\nas for all other things which go to<br />\nmake up a football team's play they<br />\nwere simply out-classed. The critics<br />\nhave gotten their hooks into our<br />\nteam this year for three things: -poor<br />\ntackling, slowness, and inability to<br />\nrecover a loose ball. Saturday the<br />\nteam without exception tackled low,<br />\nsure, and so hard that more than<br />\nonce time had to be taken out for the<br />\ntackled one. St. John's has a reputation for the rapidty with which<br />\nthey run off their plays, but one<br />\ncould not say that they showed more<br />\n<br />\nspeed than our team. They used to<br />\nboast that Hopkins never recovered<br />\na fumble, but Saturday it was quite<br />\nthe other way around, and a pair of<br />\nblack and blue arms encircled three<br />\nfumbled balls to every one held by<br />\na soldier boy.<br />\nThe forward pass was supposed to<br />\nbe a feature of the game that St.<br />\nJohn's had developed to great perfection, and it was thanks to this<br />\nstyle of play that they have made<br />\nthe grand showing that they have<br />\nthis season. So surely, however, did<br />\nour end and secondary defence break<br />\nup these plays that not once did they<br />\ncomplete a successful pass. On-side<br />\nkicks were much the same sort of<br />\na story. Their double passes, delay<br />\npasses and other tricks fooled nobody<br />\nbut themselves, and often proved<br />\nvaluable gainers of ground for Hopkins.<br />\nWe had pinned our faith in the<br />\nline smashing ability of our backs.<br />\nbut we did not expect that they<br />\nwould walk through for five, eight,<br />\nten and twelve yards at a clip. It<br />\nwas considered a pretty hopless task<br />\nto try and gain around their ends,<br />\nbut Fulton, who was largely used at<br />\nthis play, found little trouble in<br />\nskirting the wing. Running back<br />\nkicks did not prove difficult, for the<br />\ninterference was quick forming, fast,<br />\nand very much to the point. The<br />\nhelp-the-ball-along spirit which has<br />\nbeen so conspicuous this season, added many a good yard to our string.<br />\nOn several different occassions Mills<br />\nwas kept on his feet and gaining<br />\nground after two or three leech-like<br />\nJohnies had fastened to his legs.<br />\nThe defence was not far behind the<br />\nattack in effectiveness. It did not,<br />\nhowever, have the opportunity for<br />\ndemonstration, for three quarters of<br />\nthe time the pig skin was in our<br />\npossession, and even when St John's<br />\nwould get it into their hands they<br />\nwould kick on the first down. It was<br />\ncertainly a sight to gladden Hopkins'<br />\neyes to see how our ends got down<br />\nunder kicks and literally downed the<br />\nrunner before he had started, while<br />\n<br />\n22<br />\n<br />\nr:TER<br />\n<br />\n1909.<br />\n<br />\nwe were brought to our feet twenty<br />\ntimes by the breaking up of some<br />\ntrick or forward pass. Just how much<br />\nclass there was to the defence is<br />\nshown by the fact that during the<br />\nseventy minutes of play St. John's<br />\nonly made first down seven times.<br />\nThe only feature that could have<br />\nlooked good to one in gray uniform<br />\nwith black facings were the two<br />\n\u2022 times that the Annapolis team braced and held for downs within the five<br />\nyard line and the fine punting of their<br />\nfreshman end, Brown. Most of the<br />\ntime the orange and black team<br />\nseemed to be way up in the air;<br />\nrushed off their feet by our whirlwind play, and surprised into frightened and ineffective desperation.<br />\nThey were cleanly outplayed and but<br />\nslightly outweighted, for the yarns<br />\nthat we should have an advantage of<br />\nfifteen or twenty pounds to the man<br />\nwas but newspaper chatter. As the<br />\neleven lined up we had the better of<br />\nthe weight question by about five<br />\npounds, an average that was lowered in the second half when such light<br />\nmen as Gillet, Waters, and Tappen<br />\nwere sent in.<br />\nEvery mother's son who wore the<br />\nblack and blue on the field played the<br />\nof his life and each won for himself<br />\ngame of his life and won for himself<br />\nHall of Fame (Athletic Division).<br />\nOver and above and beyond the victory we can have a extra slice of the<br />\nthankful bird next Thursday because<br />\nthough a couple of the squad, Bridgman, Fulton and Peiper particularly,<br />\nwere in battered condition, still there<br />\nis not a scratch or a bruise to show<br />\nthat anyone played in Saturday's<br />\nwonderful game. In fact, if we do<br />\nnot count Stevenson's new jersey,<br />\ntime was only taken out once for a<br />\nHopkins man. From such a collection of players it is indeed difficult<br />\nto pick stars and it is a foolish custom that makes a football report incomplete without a list of those who<br />\n\"featured for Hopkins,\" as the papers<br />\nsay. Every man played well, but<br />\nthose who played \"wellest\" were Stollenwerck, Fulton, Morton, Bridgman,<br />\nMills, and McCabe.<br />\nStollenwerck ran his team like<br />\nclock work and he certainly had his<br />\nhead on his shoulders the right way.<br />\nHe carried the ball back from kicks<br />\nin a style that made the stand fairly<br />\nhowl, while catching punts seemed to<br />\nhim like holding four aces pat, and<br />\nhis drop kicking netted us six points.<br />\nHis generalship, drop kicking, and<br />\nrunning in a broken field made him<br />\njust about our \"one best\" and his<br />\nelection as captain for next year is<br />\na well deserved honor.<br />\nPillion was another star. His fifty-five yard run round end was one<br />\n<br />\nPrice, 5 cents per copy.<br />\nof the most sensational plays of the<br />\ngame, and it placed the ball where<br />\nMills could carry it over the line in<br />\n*the next play. Jack repeatedly made<br />\nbig gains round end, in fact he probably carried the ball a greater distance than any other man on the<br />\nteam. Morton at end proved himself<br />\na real hero. He was swift as a greyhound and keen as a hawk, while his<br />\ntackling was sure and hard. Bridgman, \"the old reliable Ev,\" did his<br />\nusual stunts when given the ball. The<br />\ninterference he gave Stony was wonderful and the way he put the curse<br />\non forward passes was in itself<br />\nenough to make him everlastingly famous. Musser was another who was<br />\nstrictly on the sketch all the time.<br />\nAgain and again he got through the<br />\nline and his tackling was decidedly a<br />\nfeature. Mills ploughed through the<br />\nSt. John's linemen ss if they had been<br />\na big box of lead soldiers, and the<br />\nway he backed up the line was<br />\n\"something scrumptious.\" Captain<br />\nDick at the pivotal position was a<br />\ntower of strength to the line and his<br />\naccurate passing of the ball to Fulton prevented a recurrance of the<br />\ncostly fumble of last year.<br />\n\"Revenge is sweet\" and the Hopkins cohorts went wild with joy when<br />\nthe blowing of the whistle announced<br />\nthat the game was over, while over<br />\non the score board big black letters<br />\ntold the result of Hopkins 18, St.<br />\nJohn's o. The best team that St.<br />\nJohn's has had in years was downed<br />\nby two touchdowns, two goals and<br />\ntwo field goals, and wers not even<br />\ngiven a word to say in the final score.<br />\nThe contest attracted the biggest<br />\ncrowd ever gathered together at a<br />\nfootball game in Baltimore, and many<br />\nof the former classes came out in a<br />\nbody. Probably there was never<br />\nsuch an outpouring of grads and never was there such enthusiasm among<br />\nthe undergraduates. Every one turned out and th,, singing and cheering<br />\nwas the best in years.<br />\nSaturday night was Hopkins night<br />\nnot only at Ford's, but also all over<br />\nthe city. The whole town was black<br />\nand blue and at every place where<br />\none buys eats and drinks a party of<br />\nHopkins men could be found celebrating the great victory.<br />\nAt Ford's Hattie Williams played<br />\n\"Detective Sparks\"to a house trimmed<br />\nwith Hopkins banners and filled with<br />\nHopkins rooters.<br />\nThe team sat in the boxes and their<br />\nenthusiastic supporters amused themselves and the others in the house by<br />\ncheering the eleven, the leading lady,<br />\nthemselves and T. H. U.

On parer the best judges figured out that<br />\nSt. John's would probably score with<br />\nat least one goal from the field and<br />\nvery possibly a touchdown within the<br />\nfirst twenty minutes of play and in<br />\nthe second half they gave Hopkins<br />\ntwo touchdowns and possibly a drop<br />\nfrom Stollenwerck. All of which<br />\nmerely goes to show the futility of<br />\n\"dope,\" for Hopkins got their two<br />\ntouchdowns, one in each half, and<br />\n.<br />\ntwo field goals, while the St. John's<br />\nteam only got within striking distance once during the entire seventy<br />\nminutes, and then failed miserably<br />\nin their attempt to score.<br />\nSt. John's was outplayed at every<br />\npoint of the game with the possible<br />\nexception of punting. In fact, it was<br />\ndue largely to the clever booting of<br />\nBrown, who was called upon time<br />\nand time again, that the score did<br />\nriot soar higher in our favor. But<br />\nas for all other things which go to<br />\nmake up a football team's play they<br />\nwere simply out-classed. The critics<br />\nhave gotten their hooks into our<br />\nteam this year for three things: -poor<br />\ntackling, slowness, and inability to<br />\nrecover a loose ball. Saturday the<br />\nteam without exception tackled low,<br />\nsure, and so hard that more than<br />\nonce time had to be taken out for the<br />\ntackled one. St. John's has a reputation for the rapidty with which<br />\nthey run off their plays, but one<br />\ncould not say that they showed more<br /><br />\nspeed than our team. They used to<br />\nboast that Hopkins never recovered<br />\na fumble, but Saturday it was quite<br />\nthe other way around, and a pair of<br />\nblack and blue arms encircled three<br />\nfumbled balls to every one held by<br />\na soldier boy.<br />\nThe forward pass was supposed to<br />\nbe a feature of the game that St.<br />\nJohn's had developed to great perfection, and it was thanks to this<br />\nstyle of play that they have made<br />\nthe grand showing that they have<br />\nthis season. So surely, however, did<br />\nour end and secondary defence break<br />\nup these plays that not once did they<br />\ncomplete a successful pass. On-side<br />\nkicks were much the same sort of<br />\na story. Their double passes, delay<br />\npasses and other tricks fooled nobody<br />\nbut themselves, and often proved<br />\nvaluable gainers of ground for Hopkins.<br />\nWe had pinned our faith in the<br />\nline smashing ability of our backs.<br />\nbut we did not expect that they<br />\nwould walk through for five, eight,<br />\nten and twelve yards at a clip. It<br />\nwas considered a pretty hopless task<br />\nto try and gain around their ends,<br />\nbut Fulton, who was largely used at<br />\nthis play, found little trouble in<br />\nskirting the wing. Running back<br />\nkicks did not prove difficult, for the<br />\ninterference was quick forming, fast,<br />\nand very much to the point. The<br />\nhelp-the-ball-along spirit which has<br />\nbeen so conspicuous this season, added many a good yard to our string.<br />\nOn several different occassions Mills<br />\nwas kept on his feet and gaining<br />\nground after two or three leech-like<br />\nJohnies had fastened to his legs.<br />\nThe defence was not far behind the<br />\nattack in effectiveness. It did not,<br />\nhowever, have the opportunity for<br />\ndemonstration, for three quarters of<br />\nthe time the pig skin was in our<br />\npossession, and even when St John's<br />\nwould get it into their hands they<br />\nwould kick on the first down. It was<br />\ncertainly a sight to gladden Hopkins'<br />\neyes to see how our ends got down<br />\nunder kicks and literally downed the<br />\nrunner before he had started, while<br /><br />\n22<br /><br />\nr:TER<br /><br />\n1909.<br /><br />\nwe were brought to our feet twenty<br />\ntimes by the breaking up of some<br />\ntrick or forward pass. Just how much<br />\nclass there was to the defence is<br />\nshown by the fact that during the<br />\nseventy minutes of play St. John's<br />\nonly made first down seven times.<br />\nThe only feature that could have<br />\nlooked good to one in gray uniform<br />\nwith black facings were the two<br />\n\u2022 times that the Annapolis team braced and held for downs within the five<br />\nyard line and the fine punting of their<br />\nfreshman end, Brown. Most of the<br />\ntime the orange and black team<br />\nseemed to be way up in the air;<br />\nrushed off their feet by our whirlwind play, and surprised into frightened and ineffective desperation.<br />\nThey were cleanly outplayed and but<br />\nslightly outweighted, for the yarns<br />\nthat we should have an advantage of<br />\nfifteen or twenty pounds to the man<br />\nwas but newspaper chatter. As the<br />\neleven lined up we had the better of<br />\nthe weight question by about five<br />\npounds, an average that was lowered in the second half when such light<br />\nmen as Gillet, Waters, and Tappen<br />\nwere sent in.<br />\nEvery mother's son who wore the<br />\nblack and blue on the field played the<br />\nof his life and each won for himself<br />\ngame of his life and won for himself<br />\nHall of Fame (Athletic Division).<br />\nOver and above and beyond the victory we can have a extra slice of the<br />\nthankful bird next Thursday because<br />\nthough a couple of the squad, Bridgman, Fulton and Peiper particularly,<br />\nwere in battered condition, still there<br />\nis not a scratch or a bruise to show<br />\nthat anyone played in Saturday's<br />\nwonderful game. In fact, if we do<br />\nnot count Stevenson's new jersey,<br />\ntime was only taken out once for a<br />\nHopkins man. From such a collection of players it is indeed difficult<br />\nto pick stars and it is a foolish custom that makes a football report incomplete without a list of those who<br />\n\"featured for Hopkins,\" as the papers<br />\nsay. Every man played well, but<br />\nthose who played \"wellest\" were Stollenwerck, Fulton, Morton, Bridgman,<br />\nMills, and McCabe.<br />\nStollenwerck ran his team like<br />\nclock work and he certainly had his<br />\nhead on his shoulders the right way.<br />\nHe carried the ball back from kicks<br />\nin a style that made the stand fairly<br />\nhowl, while catching punts seemed to<br />\nhim like holding four aces pat, and<br />\nhis drop kicking netted us six points.<br />\nHis generalship, drop kicking, and<br />\nrunning in a broken field made him<br />\njust about our \"one best\" and his<br />\nelection as captain for next year is<br />\na well deserved honor.<br />\nPillion was another star. His fifty-five yard run round end was one<br /><br />\nPrice, 5 cents per copy.<br />\nof the most sensational plays of the<br />\ngame, and it placed the ball where<br />\nMills could carry it over the line in<br />\n*the next play. Jack repeatedly made<br />\nbig gains round end, in fact he probably carried the ball a greater distance than any other man on the<br />\nteam. Morton at end proved himself<br />\na real hero. He was swift as a greyhound and keen as a hawk, while his<br />\ntackling was sure and hard. Bridgman, \"the old reliable Ev,\" did his<br />\nusual stunts when given the ball. The<br />\ninterference he gave Stony was wonderful and the way he put the curse<br />\non forward passes was in itself<br />\nenough to make him everlastingly famous. Musser was another who was<br />\nstrictly on the sketch all the time.<br />\nAgain and again he got through the<br />\nline and his tackling was decidedly a<br />\nfeature. Mills ploughed through the<br />\nSt. John's linemen ss if they had been<br />\na big box of lead soldiers, and the<br />\nway he backed up the line was<br />\n\"something scrumptious.\" Captain<br />\nDick at the pivotal position was a<br />\ntower of strength to the line and his<br />\naccurate passing of the ball to Fulton prevented a recurrance of the<br />\ncostly fumble of last year.<br />\n\"Revenge is sweet\" and the Hopkins cohorts went wild with joy when<br />\nthe blowing of the whistle announced<br />\nthat the game was over, while over<br />\non the score board big black letters<br />\ntold the result of Hopkins 18, St.<br />\nJohn's o. The best team that St.<br />\nJohn's has had in years was downed<br />\nby two touchdowns, two goals and<br />\ntwo field goals, and wers not even<br />\ngiven a word to say in the final score.<br />\nThe contest attracted the biggest<br />\ncrowd ever gathered together at a<br />\nfootball game in Baltimore, and many<br />\nof the former classes came out in a<br />\nbody. Probably there was never<br />\nsuch an outpouring of grads and never was there such enthusiasm among<br />\nthe undergraduates. Every one turned out and th,, singing and cheering<br />\nwas the best in years.<br />\nSaturday night was Hopkins night<br />\nnot only at Ford's, but also all over<br />\nthe city.
