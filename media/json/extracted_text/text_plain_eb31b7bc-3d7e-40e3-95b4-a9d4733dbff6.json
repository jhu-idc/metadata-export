Chris Colombo,<br />\nDirector of Student Activities, said the proposal was<br />\nstarted in the summer of 1975 at the request of Jakie<br />\nHall, Dean of Students, because \"when I first came here,<br />\nthe problem people complained about was room<br />\nreservations,\" Colombo said.<br />\nThe fifteen member JHU Union Board, comprised of<br />\nundergraduates, graduate students, faculty members,staff<br />\nmembers, and the Union Director, was assigned to discuss,<br />\namend and finally endorse the proposal. The \"room use\"<br />\nPolicy defines regulations for sponsoring organizations,<br />\nkinds of sponsorship, and fees for sponsorship. \"This<br />\nPolicy was developed to give more space to University<br />\norganizations. We can't be in the business of giving free<br />\nSpace,\" Colombo said.<br />\nUniversity organizations can book such facilities as<br />\nShriver Hall, the Glass Pavilion, the Great Hall, the<br />\nListening and Viewing Room, free of charge \"if it is a<br />\nregular program on the lecture schedule,\" according to<br />\nColombo. If a non-University group expresses interest in<br />\nholding an event of general interest n campus, and a<br />\nUniversity group wishes to co-sponsor, oom fees will be<br />\nSplit. The university organization's half of the fee will be<br />\nwaived, while the co-sponsor must pay their half of the<br />\nrental fee. Sponsorship by a non-University organization<br />\nmust be payed in full, booked six months prior to the<br />\ndate of the event, and approved by the Director of<br />\nStudent Activities. Space is granted on a first come first<br />\nserve basis, regardless of the political affiliation of the<br />\norganization, Colombo said. Asked whether any<br />\nnon-University organizations had yet been denied room<br />\nuse privileges, Colombo said he was not aware of any such<br />\ncases.<br />\nBut Ralph Moore, a member of the Chaplain's Office,<br />\nObjects that the proposal to charge non-university<br />\norganizations one half the rental rate for co-sponsored<br />\nevents could price economically deficient organizations<br />\nfrom the market. He says it's a form of \"economic,<br />\ndiscrimination\" for private groups like the People's Free<br />\nMedical Clinic, Committee for the Conversion of the<br />\nApplied Physics Lab, the food co-op, and the Baltimore<br />\nExperimental High School.

Colombo responds that local<br />\nresidents are already urged to participate in the Spring<br />\nFair, Sunday Experience lecture series, guest lectures,<br />\nand films.<br />\nFlo Leibowitz, a graduate student member of the<br />\nUnion Board, makes stronger allegations. \"They claim<br />\nthere's no room, that they.re already booked solid for<br />\ncharitable events. But I've passed empty rooms many<br />\ntimes in the week. The whole policy seems to be directed<br />\nagainst politically controversial groups. It seems to say if<br />\nyou can pay, you can use whatever you want, but I think<br />\nthe university is trying to avoid any connection with<br />\nunpopular organizations. It's circumstantial evidence, but<br />\nit's very strong.\"<br />\n<br />\n113**111<br />\n<br />\nLeibowitz proposed an amendment on the following<br />\nportion (so-called A-3) of the room reservation policy<br />\nwhich she said was too \"broad and vague\" and could be<br />\narbitrarily applied by university officials: \"When it<br />\nbecomes apparent that certain activities, because of their<br />\nvery nature, place the university in a position where it<br />\ncannot exercise its proprietal responsibility in insuring<br />\ncompliance with civil Jaw, then said activity cannot<br />\nlegitimately function on campus.\" Her amendment drawn<br />\nup by a lawyer reads as follows: \"Nothing in these<br />\nregulations shall be construed as limiting the university<br />\nfrom exercising its inherent right and respnsibility to<br />\ninsure compliance with the laws of the United States, the<br />\nState of Maryland and the City of Baltimore.\"No vote<br />\nhas been taken by the Union Board on this amendment to<br />\ndate.<br />\nThe graduate student further alleges the broad wording<br />\nof A-3 allows the administration to harrass the Hopkins<br />\nGay Caucus Alliance. University officials singled out the<br />\nGay Caucus by forcing them to register their guests at<br />\ntheir autumn dance, she said. Colombo, however, said<br />\n\"the university never questioned the existence of that<br />\ngroup. Hopkins requires registration at all dances and at<br />\nthe Rathskellar, he added. \"We're not trying to ruin<br />\npeople's lives.\" But if the organization breaks the<br />\nproprietal responsibility of Hopkins to uphold the law,<br />\nthe group, any group, will not be allowed to use the<br />\nroom again.\"<br />\nMichael Liss, Chairman of the Union Board said the<br />\nproblem with Gay Caucus dances is that \"90% of the<br />\npeople\" are from the outside. \"The first couple were well.<br />\nbehaved. The Union managers did complain that the last<br />\ndance got a little. rowdy.\" No evidence of illegality is<br />\nknown. But Leibowitz said \"it's a question of making so<br />\nmany requirements. It's asking alot for those people to<br />\nput their name on paper.\"<br />\nThe Union Board will reconsider the \"room use\"<br />\nproposal during their next session before the end of the<br />\nsemester.

It's not because we're<br />\nselective, but we have only one<br />\nbrewery, in Golden, Colorado. And<br />\neven though it's the largest single<br />\nbrewery in the country, we simply<br />\ncan't make enough beer to supply<br />\nthe rest of the country.<br />\nStill, a goodly amount of Coors<br />\nfinds its way to stores and markets in<br />\nthe East, especially in college towns.<br />\nWhich leads us to our problem. Too<br />\noften, an Eastern college man, with<br />\nhigh hopes and great expectations,<br />\nwill quaff our beer and suffer instant<br />\ndisillusionment. \"Flat:' he might say.<br />\nOr even \"watery:'<br />\nAnd truth be known, it often is.<br />\nBut since we don't make Coors that<br />\nway, there must be an explanation.<br />\n<br />\nnatural taste. (In the West, we encourage the selling of Coors within<br />\n60 days after packaging.)<br />\n<br />\nThroughout the West, Coors Beer is<br />\nshipped, and stored, under refrigeration to preserve its fresh, natural taste.<br />\nAbout price.<br />\nBut when Coors comes to the East, In the West, Coors is priced right<br />\nwe don't know how it got here. May- with the other good beers. In the East,<br />\nbe it was refrigerated, maybe it wasn't. you are usually asked to pay more.<br />\nSo maybe the beer you buy isn't (Not by us, incidentally. We sell only<br />\nas good as the beer we made. Re- to our regular distributors, and at one<br />\nmember \u2014just because Coors is cold price. We are not involved in shipping<br />\nin the store doesn't mean it was Coors to the East.)<br />\nshipped cold.<br />\nStill, it concerns us. If you pay<br />\nIncidentally, to dispel a rumor the extra pricedou should at least get<br />\n\u201e<br />\nwe've heard, Coors will not \"go bad<br />\nCoors the way we make it, fresh<br />\nif shipped unrefrigerated. It simply and full of flavor.<br />\nloses some of the lively, fresh taste<br />\nwe work so hard to put in.<br />\nFor now, we can only think of one:<br />\nTransfer. If that's a bit too radical,<br />\nTurn the can over. On the bottom is come visit us in the West, where<br />\na date, the day it was packaged at Coors is Coors.<br />\nour brewery. If your Coors is more<br />\nthan 60 days old, there's a good<br />\nchance that it's lost some of its fresh,<br />\n<br />\n\fBasemen<br />\nbid for<br />\nNCAA berth<br />\nBy AL DANIELS<br />\nWith highly touted Widener losing to Ursinus this past<br />\nSaturday, the Jays have but to beat Swarthmore in a<br />\ntwinbill, postponed by rain until May, to win an NCAA<br />\nplayoff berth.<br />\nWith everyone on the team taking the spotlight at one<br />\ntime or another, their charge towards their present 13-4<br />\nrecord (7-1 in the MAC) went as follows this past week.<br />\nThe Orioles were fighting the rain in Detroit rock city;<br />\nthere were no birds as we passed through Graceham but<br />\nfor sure the baseball Blue Jays were in Chestertown last<br />\nSaturday to take two from the Shoremen of Washington<br />\nCollege, 3-2 and 7-4.<br />\nFirst though let's get them on the bus. They weren't<br />\nquite ready to board last Tuesday as they swept their 4th<br />\nand 5th of 8 straight with the victim being the U. of Md.<br />\nEastern Shore Hawks,6-5 and 2-0.<br />\nBob Babb, who stole four bases on the day, knocked in<br />\nSteve Galloway, of bench jockeying fame, with the<br />\nwinning run.<br />\nFrank Parreira ended his complete game win by striking<br />\nout a guy who got a triple off him two innings earlier on a<br />\ntough curve ball. Frank, however, was the victim three<br />\nnights later when he was on the the receiving end of a<br />\nswitchblade attack during Spring Fair. Despite 30 stitches,<br />\nParreira was able to play at Washington College and<br />\nperformed well.<br />\nAfter four consecutive one-run victories, the Jays gave<br />\nJason Sussman a bit more leeway in the second game, but<br />\njust barely so. For the JH kids, 3rd batter Emala was<br />\nclutch in knocking in the winning run of the 2nd UMES<br />\ngame. Em plated Babb and rightfielder John Santo was<br />\nsent across with an insurance run as Lewing slugged a<br />\ndouble that was almost out of the park. Dave earned<br />\nnational distinction by placing 3rd among all power<br />\nhitters with three home runs in the team's 1st S games, all<br />\nhit on the road. Commenting on the spaciousness of the<br />\n<br />\nJays' home field leftfielder Lewing said \"it would take a<br />\ncannon to get one out of here.\" There's always plenty of<br />\nroom for hits to fall in though.<br />\nOn the mound for the Hop, Jason Sussman twirled a<br />\n5-hitter whiffing nine and walking none. The team played<br />\ncrucial errorless ball behind him, as they have for all their<br />\nshutouts, and was almost ready to roll.<br />\nThursday JHU beat rival Loyola by a score of 7-4, the<br />\nfirst Hopkins sports team to beat our Charles St. rivals<br />\nthis year.<br />\nHurlers Charlie Lachenbruch, who only hielded 3 hits<br />\nand 1 earned run in 6 innings, and winning reliever<br />\nSteffan \"Junk-Balling\" Burns starred.<br />\nThe hero, however, was Mike April who knocked the<br />\nwinning run in with two outs in the 8th on a clutch<br />\ndouble. \"Little Wootten\" has been a consistent star in<br />\ncenterfield as well, as at the plate.<br />\nBesides keeping the winning streak intact, the<br />\ndoubleheader win at Washington catapulted the Jays into<br />\n<br />\nfirst place in their division of the MAC.<br />\nThe Santo brothers Michael John and John Michael<br />\n\u2022found a good number of fans in the bleachers: a little of<br />\nthe family, a little of Lazear. Mike pitched excellently and<br />\nthe team won 3-2 in the first game on his 3-hitter.<br />\nJohn broke a 4-4 tie late in the 2nd game with a 3-run<br />\ndouble and the team goes on to score 7 runs in the inning.<br />\nBabb and Emala consistently smack the ball around all<br />\nday and collect extra base hits. Lewing smacks one<br />\ncompletely out of the ball park.<br />\nJason Sussman wins his 3rd without a loss by the score<br />\nof 14-5, pitching with a dose of velocity and a maximum<br />\nof smarts.<br />\nEight in a row.- Longest winning streak by any JHU<br />\nteam, except for the classy fencing squad. Parreira is<br />\nforced out of the twinbill late in the 2nd game with a bee<br />\nsting;it wasn't his greatest weekend.<br />\nJHU baseball Blue Jays are playing an interdivisional<br />\nconference game at home tomorrow at 3 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nBig Blue steamrolls Brown as Huntley stars<br />\nBy ANDREW COHEN<br />\nWhile many of us '.ere sampling the ethnic foods,<br />\nlounging in the quad plistening to the super sounds, trying<br />\nour own luck at the wheel of fortune, or just plain<br />\nenjoying the insurgance of new life that had been brought<br />\nto the Hopkins campus by the Spring Fair, the Blue Jay<br />\nVarsity Lacrosse team was finding new life of its own<br />\nafter last week's disappointing loss by whipping the<br />\nBruins of Brown University, 17-8, on Homewood Field<br />\nSaturday afternoon.<br />\nOver 4200 spectators sitting under heavily overcast<br />\nskies witnessed the Jays combine a well balanced scoring<br />\nattack, led by sophomore midfielder Dave Huntley with<br />\nfour goals and one assist, with a strong defense, led by<br />\nfreshman defender Mark Greenberg and a sparkling Kevin<br />\nMahon, senior tri-captain, in goal. There had been a<br />\nquestion as to how well)the team would perform in those<br />\nareas due to the injunesIsuffered by middle Tom Myrick<br />\n(twisted knee, out until Maryland game) last week at<br />\nCornell and lettering defenseman Mike Sheedy (twisted<br />\nankle, out until Navy game) before Saturday's contest in<br />\nthe warm-up, but these fears were!quickly laid to rest.<br />\nThe Hopkins' lax men answered all questions, though,<br />\nwithin the first few minutes of the game. Off the face off,<br />\nthe Bruins took control and paraded through Jay territory<br />\nfor a full two minutes. Fine checking by Greenberg and<br />\nfrosh starter Leroy Katz kept the opponents from getting<br />\noff any appreciable shot. Instead, Greenberg stole the ball<br />\nand spearheaded a drive that led to a goal by sophomore<br />\nFrank Cutrone, aided by one of Rich Hirsch's three assists<br />\nfor the game. Seconds later at 3:17 of the first quarter,<br />\nmidfielder Phil Frederico, off a feed from sophomore Bob<br />\nTeasdall, fired a shot that Bruin goalie Rich Gittleman<br />\ninitially stopped, but allowed to tricklein off his stick for<br />\nthe Blue Jay 2-0 lead:<br />\nThe third ranked Jays increased their first quarter lead<br />\nto 4 and 0 when with 3:59 left senior George Johnson<br />\nrifled home a goal of a nifty pass from leading scorer Mike<br />\nO'Neill (2 goals, 2 assists in this game) and minutes later<br />\nmiddle Bob Desimone picked off an errant Bruin pass in<br />\nhis own end and took the ball all the way downfield<br />\nbefore passing off to Huntley who slammed it in.<br />\nThe Bruin's somewhat sloppy offense finally got in gear<br />\nin the second quarter when their star attaclunan freshman<br />\n<br />\nRich Handelman fed middie Jack Lawrence who pumped<br />\nit in, ten feet out on the left side of the net.<br />\nHopkins answered back with two more goals, a Huntley<br />\nto Hirsch combo at 4:54 and an O'Neill unassisted break<br />\naway with 8:19 left. Bruin attackman Rich Care11 added<br />\nthe final tally of the first half when he slapped a loose ball<br />\nin from in front of the Jay net. It seemed that the potent<br />\nBlue Jay offense was too much for Gittleman and<br />\ncompany as they took 28 Jay shots while mustering only<br />\n15 of their own.<br />\nOff the second half face, DeSimone took the ball right<br />\non goal. His shot was kicked out by the Brown net<br />\nminder, but O'Neill scooped up the rebound and crossfed<br />\nHuntley for the score.<br />\nBrown continued to struggle back as Handelman gave a<br />\nstrong individual effort in circling the Jay net before<br />\nfiring an off balanced shot past Mahon. The goal didn't<br />\ndisturb Chic's boys as they flew right back in scoring<br />\nthree consecutive goals, one by Teasdall at 5:09 of the<br />\nthird quarter, one by O'Neill at 7:40, and one by<br />\nsophomore midfielder Joe Garavente at 8:33. At this<br />\npoint coach Henry Ciccarone replaced Mahon with junior<br />\n<br />\ngoalie Jay Trainor.<br />\nClosing the third quarter and beginning the fourth, the<br />\nJays began to relive shades of Cornell a week ago, as the<br />\nBruins piled in three unanswered goals by midfielders<br />\nJohn Grill and Dennis Longpre, and Handelman. With<br />\nabout 12 minutes left in the contest, the Jays held a 10-6<br />\nlead.<br />\nThey were not about to go through last week's<br />\n3xperience again, though, and the Jays began to pour it<br />\non. By game's end the Blue Jays had outscored the Bruins<br />\n7-2 with goals; two a piece from Huntley and frosh Jon<br />\nSwerdloff, and one a piece from Garavente,junior Doober<br />\nAuburn, and sophomore Scott Baugher. Handelman and<br />\nCare11 dumped in the final goals for the Bruins and the<br />\nJays won 17-8.. Overall, the Jays had outshot the Bruins<br />\nof Brown 55-32.<br />\n\"We were a bit disheartened over last week's loss,\" said<br />\nthe coach, \"but we played well against a somewhat flat<br />\nBrown who did hang in well.\"<br />\nThe Jays now travel to West Point to play Army,<br />\nbefore facing off with Navy in two weeks at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nLady lacrossers hit skids<br />\nBy RON BIALEK<br />\nSuffering from a lack of good team play, the Blue Jay<br />\nWomen's Lacrosse team has fallen into a slump, losing<br />\ntwo consecutive league games and having a relatively poor<br />\nshowing this past weekend in the Essex College<br />\nTournament.<br />\nComing off their best played of the season, with some<br />\nspectacular passing plays, resulting in a crushing 9-4 win<br />\nover Gerogetown, the Blue Jays were sent out on the road<br />\nto meet Western Maryland. The same fine play was<br />\nnowhere to be found, losing 12 to 6. Our women in blue<br />\nwere unable to keep their momentum going or their<br />\npasses connecting.<br />\nThursday, the Blue Jays returned to Garland field to<br />\ntake on their old rival, undefeated Goucher College.<br />\nTwelve individuals gathered for Hopkins to compete<br />\nagainst one solid Goucher team. The fine teamtvork<br />\nexhibited by the home team in the past, was absent once<br />\nagain.<br />\n<br />\nThe tough loss to Goucher could have easily been<br />\nforgotten this past weekend at the Essex College<br />\ntournament. Friday after,ioon was no time to forget, as<br />\nUMBC went on to shut out our women in blue with 1-7<br />\ngoals.

Chris Colombo,<br />\nDirector of Student Activities, said the proposal was<br />\nstarted in the summer of 1975 at the request of Jakie<br />\nHall, Dean of Students, because \"when I first came here,<br />\nthe problem people complained about was room<br />\nreservations,\" Colombo said.<br />\nThe fifteen member JHU Union Board, comprised of<br />\nundergraduates, graduate students, faculty members,staff<br />\nmembers, and the Union Director, was assigned to discuss,<br />\namend and finally endorse the proposal. The \"room use\"<br />\nPolicy defines regulations for sponsoring organizations,<br />\nkinds of sponsorship, and fees for sponsorship. \"This<br />\nPolicy was developed to give more space to University<br />\norganizations. We can't be in the business of giving free<br />\nSpace,\" Colombo said.<br />\nUniversity organizations can book such facilities as<br />\nShriver Hall, the Glass Pavilion, the Great Hall, the<br />\nListening and Viewing Room, free of charge \"if it is a<br />\nregular program on the lecture schedule,\" according to<br />\nColombo. If a non-University group expresses interest in<br />\nholding an event of general interest n campus, and a<br />\nUniversity group wishes to co-sponsor, oom fees will be<br />\nSplit. The university organization's half of the fee will be<br />\nwaived, while the co-sponsor must pay their half of the<br />\nrental fee. Sponsorship by a non-University organization<br />\nmust be payed in full, booked six months prior to the<br />\ndate of the event, and approved by the Director of<br />\nStudent Activities. Space is granted on a first come first<br />\nserve basis, regardless of the political affiliation of the<br />\norganization, Colombo said. Asked whether any<br />\nnon-University organizations had yet been denied room<br />\nuse privileges, Colombo said he was not aware of any such<br />\ncases.<br />\nBut Ralph Moore, a member of the Chaplain's Office,<br />\nObjects that the proposal to charge non-university<br />\norganizations one half the rental rate for co-sponsored<br />\nevents could price economically deficient organizations<br />\nfrom the market. He says it's a form of \"economic,<br />\ndiscrimination\" for private groups like the People's Free<br />\nMedical Clinic, Committee for the Conversion of the<br />\nApplied Physics Lab, the food co-op, and the Baltimore<br />\nExperimental High School.

Colombo responds that local<br />\nresidents are already urged to participate in the Spring<br />\nFair, Sunday Experience lecture series, guest lectures,<br />\nand films.<br />\nFlo Leibowitz, a graduate student member of the<br />\nUnion Board, makes stronger allegations. \"They claim<br />\nthere's no room, that they.re already booked solid for<br />\ncharitable events. But I've passed empty rooms many<br />\ntimes in the week. The whole policy seems to be directed<br />\nagainst politically controversial groups. It seems to say if<br />\nyou can pay, you can use whatever you want, but I think<br />\nthe university is trying to avoid any connection with<br />\nunpopular organizations. It's circumstantial evidence, but<br />\nit's very strong.\"<br /><br />\n113**111<br /><br />\nLeibowitz proposed an amendment on the following<br />\nportion (so-called A-3) of the room reservation policy<br />\nwhich she said was too \"broad and vague\" and could be<br />\narbitrarily applied by university officials: \"When it<br />\nbecomes apparent that certain activities, because of their<br />\nvery nature, place the university in a position where it<br />\ncannot exercise its proprietal responsibility in insuring<br />\ncompliance with civil Jaw, then said activity cannot<br />\nlegitimately function on campus.\" Her amendment drawn<br />\nup by a lawyer reads as follows: \"Nothing in these<br />\nregulations shall be construed as limiting the university<br />\nfrom exercising its inherent right and respnsibility to<br />\ninsure compliance with the laws of the United States, the<br />\nState of Maryland and the City of Baltimore.\"No vote<br />\nhas been taken by the Union Board on this amendment to<br />\ndate.<br />\nThe graduate student further alleges the broad wording<br />\nof A-3 allows the administration to harrass the Hopkins<br />\nGay Caucus Alliance. University officials singled out the<br />\nGay Caucus by forcing them to register their guests at<br />\ntheir autumn dance, she said. Colombo, however, said<br />\n\"the university never questioned the existence of that<br />\ngroup. Hopkins requires registration at all dances and at<br />\nthe Rathskellar, he added. \"We're not trying to ruin<br />\npeople's lives.\" But if the organization breaks the<br />\nproprietal responsibility of Hopkins to uphold the law,<br />\nthe group, any group, will not be allowed to use the<br />\nroom again.\"<br />\nMichael Liss, Chairman of the Union Board said the<br />\nproblem with Gay Caucus dances is that \"90% of the<br />\npeople\" are from the outside. \"The first couple were well.<br />\nbehaved. The Union managers did complain that the last<br />\ndance got a little. rowdy.\" No evidence of illegality is<br />\nknown. But Leibowitz said \"it's a question of making so<br />\nmany requirements. It's asking alot for those people to<br />\nput their name on paper.\"<br />\nThe Union Board will reconsider the \"room use\"<br />\nproposal during their next session before the end of the<br />\nsemester.

It's not because we're<br />\nselective, but we have only one<br />\nbrewery, in Golden, Colorado. And<br />\neven though it's the largest single<br />\nbrewery in the country, we simply<br />\ncan't make enough beer to supply<br />\nthe rest of the country.<br />\nStill, a goodly amount of Coors<br />\nfinds its way to stores and markets in<br />\nthe East, especially in college towns.<br />\nWhich leads us to our problem. Too<br />\noften, an Eastern college man, with<br />\nhigh hopes and great expectations,<br />\nwill quaff our beer and suffer instant<br />\ndisillusionment. \"Flat:' he might say.<br />\nOr even \"watery:'<br />\nAnd truth be known, it often is.<br />\nBut since we don't make Coors that<br />\nway, there must be an explanation.<br /><br />\nnatural taste. (In the West, we encourage the selling of Coors within<br />\n60 days after packaging.)<br /><br />\nThroughout the West, Coors Beer is<br />\nshipped, and stored, under refrigeration to preserve its fresh, natural taste.<br />\nAbout price.<br />\nBut when Coors comes to the East, In the West, Coors is priced right<br />\nwe don't know how it got here. May- with the other good beers. In the East,<br />\nbe it was refrigerated, maybe it wasn't. you are usually asked to pay more.<br />\nSo maybe the beer you buy isn't (Not by us, incidentally. We sell only<br />\nas good as the beer we made. Re- to our regular distributors, and at one<br />\nmember \u2014just because Coors is cold price. We are not involved in shipping<br />\nin the store doesn't mean it was Coors to the East.)<br />\nshipped cold.<br />\nStill, it concerns us. If you pay<br />\nIncidentally, to dispel a rumor the extra pricedou should at least get<br />\n\u201e<br />\nwe've heard, Coors will not \"go bad<br />\nCoors the way we make it, fresh<br />\nif shipped unrefrigerated. It simply and full of flavor.<br />\nloses some of the lively, fresh taste<br />\nwe work so hard to put in.<br />\nFor now, we can only think of one:<br />\nTransfer. If that's a bit too radical,<br />\nTurn the can over. On the bottom is come visit us in the West, where<br />\na date, the day it was packaged at Coors is Coors.<br />\nour brewery. If your Coors is more<br />\nthan 60 days old, there's a good<br />\nchance that it's lost some of its fresh,<br /><br />\nBasemen<br />\nbid for<br />\nNCAA berth<br />\nBy AL DANIELS<br />\nWith highly touted Widener losing to Ursinus this past<br />\nSaturday, the Jays have but to beat Swarthmore in a<br />\ntwinbill, postponed by rain until May, to win an NCAA<br />\nplayoff berth.<br />\nWith everyone on the team taking the spotlight at one<br />\ntime or another, their charge towards their present 13-4<br />\nrecord (7-1 in the MAC) went as follows this past week.<br />\nThe Orioles were fighting the rain in Detroit rock city;<br />\nthere were no birds as we passed through Graceham but<br />\nfor sure the baseball Blue Jays were in Chestertown last<br />\nSaturday to take two from the Shoremen of Washington<br />\nCollege, 3-2 and 7-4.<br />\nFirst though let's get them on the bus. They weren't<br />\nquite ready to board last Tuesday as they swept their 4th<br />\nand 5th of 8 straight with the victim being the U. of Md.<br />\nEastern Shore Hawks,6-5 and 2-0.<br />\nBob Babb, who stole four bases on the day, knocked in<br />\nSteve Galloway, of bench jockeying fame, with the<br />\nwinning run.<br />\nFrank Parreira ended his complete game win by striking<br />\nout a guy who got a triple off him two innings earlier on a<br />\ntough curve ball. Frank, however, was the victim three<br />\nnights later when he was on the the receiving end of a<br />\nswitchblade attack during Spring Fair. Despite 30 stitches,<br />\nParreira was able to play at Washington College and<br />\nperformed well.<br />\nAfter four consecutive one-run victories, the Jays gave<br />\nJason Sussman a bit more leeway in the second game, but<br />\njust barely so. For the JH kids, 3rd batter Emala was<br />\nclutch in knocking in the winning run of the 2nd UMES<br />\ngame. Em plated Babb and rightfielder John Santo was<br />\nsent across with an insurance run as Lewing slugged a<br />\ndouble that was almost out of the park. Dave earned<br />\nnational distinction by placing 3rd among all power<br />\nhitters with three home runs in the team's 1st S games, all<br />\nhit on the road. Commenting on the spaciousness of the<br /><br />\nJays' home field leftfielder Lewing said \"it would take a<br />\ncannon to get one out of here.\" There's always plenty of<br />\nroom for hits to fall in though.<br />\nOn the mound for the Hop, Jason Sussman twirled a<br />\n5-hitter whiffing nine and walking none. The team played<br />\ncrucial errorless ball behind him, as they have for all their<br />\nshutouts, and was almost ready to roll.<br />\nThursday JHU beat rival Loyola by a score of 7-4, the<br />\nfirst Hopkins sports team to beat our Charles St. rivals<br />\nthis year.<br />\nHurlers Charlie Lachenbruch, who only hielded 3 hits<br />\nand 1 earned run in 6 innings, and winning reliever<br />\nSteffan \"Junk-Balling\" Burns starred.<br />\nThe hero, however, was Mike April who knocked the<br />\nwinning run in with two outs in the 8th on a clutch<br />\ndouble. \"Little Wootten\" has been a consistent star in<br />\ncenterfield as well, as at the plate.<br />\nBesides keeping the winning streak intact, the<br />\ndoubleheader win at Washington catapulted the Jays into<br /><br />\nfirst place in their division of the MAC.<br />\nThe Santo brothers Michael John and John Michael<br />\n\u2022found a good number of fans in the bleachers: a little of<br />\nthe family, a little of Lazear. Mike pitched excellently and<br />\nthe team won 3-2 in the first game on his 3-hitter.<br />\nJohn broke a 4-4 tie late in the 2nd game with a 3-run<br />\ndouble and the team goes on to score 7 runs in the inning.<br />\nBabb and Emala consistently smack the ball around all<br />\nday and collect extra base hits. Lewing smacks one<br />\ncompletely out of the ball park.<br />\nJason Sussman wins his 3rd without a loss by the score<br />\nof 14-5, pitching with a dose of velocity and a maximum<br />\nof smarts.<br />\nEight in a row.- Longest winning streak by any JHU<br />\nteam, except for the classy fencing squad. Parreira is<br />\nforced out of the twinbill late in the 2nd game with a bee<br />\nsting;it wasn't his greatest weekend.<br />\nJHU baseball Blue Jays are playing an interdivisional<br />\nconference game at home tomorrow at 3 p.m.<br /><br />\nBig Blue steamrolls Brown as Huntley stars<br />\nBy ANDREW COHEN<br />\nWhile many of us '.ere sampling the ethnic foods,<br />\nlounging in the quad plistening to the super sounds, trying<br />\nour own luck at the wheel of fortune, or just plain<br />\nenjoying the insurgance of new life that had been brought<br />\nto the Hopkins campus by the Spring Fair, the Blue Jay<br />\nVarsity Lacrosse team was finding new life of its own<br />\nafter last week's disappointing loss by whipping the<br />\nBruins of Brown University, 17-8, on Homewood Field<br />\nSaturday afternoon.<br />\nOver 4200 spectators sitting under heavily overcast<br />\nskies witnessed the Jays combine a well balanced scoring<br />\nattack, led by sophomore midfielder Dave Huntley with<br />\nfour goals and one assist, with a strong defense, led by<br />\nfreshman defender Mark Greenberg and a sparkling Kevin<br />\nMahon, senior tri-captain, in goal. There had been a<br />\nquestion as to how well)the team would perform in those<br />\nareas due to the injunesIsuffered by middle Tom Myrick<br />\n(twisted knee, out until Maryland game) last week at<br />\nCornell and lettering defenseman Mike Sheedy (twisted<br />\nankle, out until Navy game) before Saturday's contest in<br />\nthe warm-up, but these fears were!quickly laid to rest.<br />\nThe Hopkins' lax men answered all questions, though,<br />\nwithin the first few minutes of the game. Off the face off,<br />\nthe Bruins took control and paraded through Jay territory<br />\nfor a full two minutes. Fine checking by Greenberg and<br />\nfrosh starter Leroy Katz kept the opponents from getting<br />\noff any appreciable shot. Instead, Greenberg stole the ball<br />\nand spearheaded a drive that led to a goal by sophomore<br />\nFrank Cutrone, aided by one of Rich Hirsch's three assists<br />\nfor the game. Seconds later at 3:17 of the first quarter,<br />\nmidfielder Phil Frederico, off a feed from sophomore Bob<br />\nTeasdall, fired a shot that Bruin goalie Rich Gittleman<br />\ninitially stopped, but allowed to tricklein off his stick for<br />\nthe Blue Jay 2-0 lead:<br />\nThe third ranked Jays increased their first quarter lead<br />\nto 4 and 0 when with 3:59 left senior George Johnson<br />\nrifled home a goal of a nifty pass from leading scorer Mike<br />\nO'Neill (2 goals, 2 assists in this game) and minutes later<br />\nmiddle Bob Desimone picked off an errant Bruin pass in<br />\nhis own end and took the ball all the way downfield<br />\nbefore passing off to Huntley who slammed it in.<br />\nThe Bruin's somewhat sloppy offense finally got in gear<br />\nin the second quarter when their star attaclunan freshman<br /><br />\nRich Handelman fed middie Jack Lawrence who pumped<br />\nit in, ten feet out on the left side of the net.<br />\nHopkins answered back with two more goals, a Huntley<br />\nto Hirsch combo at 4:54 and an O'Neill unassisted break<br />\naway with 8:19 left. Bruin attackman Rich Care11 added<br />\nthe final tally of the first half when he slapped a loose ball<br />\nin from in front of the Jay net. It seemed that the potent<br />\nBlue Jay offense was too much for Gittleman and<br />\ncompany as they took 28 Jay shots while mustering only<br />\n15 of their own.<br />\nOff the second half face, DeSimone took the ball right<br />\non goal. His shot was kicked out by the Brown net<br />\nminder, but O'Neill scooped up the rebound and crossfed<br />\nHuntley for the score.<br />\nBrown continued to struggle back as Handelman gave a<br />\nstrong individual effort in circling the Jay net before<br />\nfiring an off balanced shot past Mahon. The goal didn't<br />\ndisturb Chic's boys as they flew right back in scoring<br />\nthree consecutive goals, one by Teasdall at 5:09 of the<br />\nthird quarter, one by O'Neill at 7:40, and one by<br />\nsophomore midfielder Joe Garavente at 8:33. At this<br />\npoint coach Henry Ciccarone replaced Mahon with junior<br /><br />\ngoalie Jay Trainor.<br />\nClosing the third quarter and beginning the fourth, the<br />\nJays began to relive shades of Cornell a week ago, as the<br />\nBruins piled in three unanswered goals by midfielders<br />\nJohn Grill and Dennis Longpre, and Handelman. With<br />\nabout 12 minutes left in the contest, the Jays held a 10-6<br />\nlead.<br />\nThey were not about to go through last week's<br />\n3xperience again, though, and the Jays began to pour it<br />\non. By game's end the Blue Jays had outscored the Bruins<br />\n7-2 with goals; two a piece from Huntley and frosh Jon<br />\nSwerdloff, and one a piece from Garavente,junior Doober<br />\nAuburn, and sophomore Scott Baugher. Handelman and<br />\nCare11 dumped in the final goals for the Bruins and the<br />\nJays won 17-8.. Overall, the Jays had outshot the Bruins<br />\nof Brown 55-32.<br />\n\"We were a bit disheartened over last week's loss,\" said<br />\nthe coach, \"but we played well against a somewhat flat<br />\nBrown who did hang in well.\"<br />\nThe Jays now travel to West Point to play Army,<br />\nbefore facing off with Navy in two weeks at Homewood.<br /><br />\nLady lacrossers hit skids<br />\nBy RON BIALEK<br />\nSuffering from a lack of good team play, the Blue Jay<br />\nWomen's Lacrosse team has fallen into a slump, losing<br />\ntwo consecutive league games and having a relatively poor<br />\nshowing this past weekend in the Essex College<br />\nTournament.<br />\nComing off their best played of the season, with some<br />\nspectacular passing plays, resulting in a crushing 9-4 win<br />\nover Gerogetown, the Blue Jays were sent out on the road<br />\nto meet Western Maryland. The same fine play was<br />\nnowhere to be found, losing 12 to 6.

Friday after,ioon was no time to forget, as<br />\nUMBC went on to shut out our women in blue with 1-7<br />\ngoals. There is no doubt that UMBC is a better team than<br />\nHopkins, but there is no doubt that we're a better team<br />\nthan we showed.<br />\nthe Jays' second game in the tournament came!<br />\nSaturday against the tough Salisbury State.
