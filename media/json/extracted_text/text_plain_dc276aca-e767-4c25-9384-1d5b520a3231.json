Ludden arrives carrying a large cup<br />\nof hot tea with lemon to correct a 'very bad throat which<br />\nmakes him sound like a frog.<br />\nHe explains the basic ground<br />\nrules of the game and then begins throwing questions. Hopkins answers two-thirds or better of the toss-ups and the<br />\ngirls' composure (unshaken up<br />\nto now) begins to slip.<br />\n12:00\u2014Teams, coaches, and<br />\nalternates go to the Sheraton<br />\nfor lunch with the producer of<br />\nthe show.

Hopkins takes<br />\nseveral very obscure toss-ups<br />\nand bonuses, gassing the girls<br />\neven worse. The girls begin to<br />\nbe a little alarmed not only because the Hopkins team knows<br />\nthe answers, but because they<br />\nalso know the questions. (At<br />\nleast half of the questions used<br />\nat rehearsals came from old<br />\nshows or from the book now on<br />\nnewsstands.) At the end of the<br />\nfirst half, the score stands Hopkins 150, Sweetbriar-5. Final<br />\nscore, Hopkins 250, Sweetbriar,<br />\n70.<br />\n<br />\n2:30\u2014Second rehearsal. Hopkins continues in usual style.<br />\nFinal score, Hopkins 325, Sweetbriar 25. As the final whistle<br />\nblows, one of the Sweetbriar<br />\ngirls faints. She is revived quickly and carried upstairs to their<br />\ndressing room. Hopkins team<br />\nfaintly amused.<br />\nBut I. digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.<br />\nA doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears<br />\ngreen,a master of arts wears white,a doctor of humanities wears<br />\ncrimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?<br />\nWhy,for example,should a master of library science wear lemon<br />\nyellow?<br />\nWell sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to<br />\nMarch 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the<br />\nUnited States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.<br />\nSigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful\u2014all, that<br />\nis, except Wrex Todhunter.<br />\nMr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both<br />\nmen had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had<br />\nchosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.<br />\nSigafoos knew all the latest steps,like the Missouri Compromise<br />\nMambo the Shay's Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.<br />\nPolk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all<br />\nowing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.<br />\n(He was struck by a falling praline.)<br />\nConsumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos's<br />\nlibrary, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.<br />\nThis he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.<br />\nSigafoos.\"What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven't got?\" Mr.<br />\nTodhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to<br />\nhim: books.<br />\nSo Mr.Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books<br />\nand soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.<br />\nBut Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began<br />\nserving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea.<br />\nwith sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with<br />\nsugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving<br />\ntea with sugar and cream and lemon.<br />\nThis, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter because he had the only lemon tree in town\u2014in fact, in the entire<br />\nstate of North Dakota\u2014and since that day lemon yellow has of<br />\ncourse been the color on the academic robes of library science.<br />\n(Incidentally, the defeated Mr.Sigafoos packed up his library<br />\nand moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There<br />\nwere, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,<br />\nalas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced<br />\nto California until 1931 by John Wayne.)<br />\ne 1961 Max Shulman<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nAnd today Californians, happy among their Guernseys and<br />\nHolsteins, are discovering a great new cigarette\u2014the unfiltered, king-size Philip Morris Commander\u2014and so are<br />\n<br />\nAmericans in all fifty states.

To an appreciative audience of moderate size, Dr.<br />\nBryllion Fagin, Associate Professor of English and Drama<br />\n(Ret.), delivered a talk on \"The<br />\nNew Drama in the United States<br />\nand Europe\".<br />\n<br />\nrevivals of Ibsen and O'Casey.<br />\nDespite this, Dr. Fagin felt that<br />\n\"We have created a generation<br />\nof people who are competent,<br />\nand that is'a curse because more<br />\nemphasis is placed on the slick<br />\nand the good, or rather on the<br />\nhow, and not the what.\" In short<br />\nwe have tension or suspense engendered into our plays, but we<br />\nhave nothing to say.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral basic points were<br />\nbrought out by Dr. Fagin. In<br />\nhis opinion, the majority of<br />\ncontemporary drama is typified<br />\nby a lack of substance, a lack<br />\nof strong characterization, and<br />\nthe use of technique to cover up<br />\nmissing imagination. Also Dr.<br />\nFagin felt that only three countries were worth discussing:<br />\nFrance, England, and the United<br />\nStates.<br />\n<br />\nOn turning to France, Dr.<br />\nFagin had only praise for the<br />\nworks of Camus, Sartre, Becket,<br />\nGenet, and Ionesco. However,<br />\nhe found that here there was<br />\ntoo much of an attempt to graft<br />\nlines that will go well on stage<br />\ninto the plays. Another fault<br />\nfound by Dr. Fagin is that a<br />\nman like Ione,sco works. the<br />\nthemes of his play to death, or<br />\nthat Beckett keeps stressing the<br />\ntheme of pessimism without<br />\nreaching any climax. Despite<br />\nthese drawbacks, plays like<br />\nGenet's The Blacks, and Alpuna's The Condemned have a<br />\ngreat deal to say.<br />\n<br />\nAmerican drama has disappointed Dr. Fagin with a<br />\nPaucity of creativeness shown<br />\nby modern playwrights, as well<br />\nas the reliance of producers on<br />\neither biographies or on the<br />\ndramatization of novels or television scripts. Dr. Fagin complained that today's plays do<br />\nnot deal with the basic problems<br />\nthat concern us; in short, one<br />\ndoes not come away with any<br />\ntype of message.<br />\nThe Present Hope<br />\nOff Broadway, however, provides some hope for the American Theatre\u2014contributing playwrights like Jack Richardson and<br />\nEdward Albee, and many fine<br />\n<br />\nEnglish Social Drama<br />\nIn<br />\nEnglish' drama<br />\nthere<br />\nemerges a new wave of playwrights who have something to<br />\nsay, and who are not interested<br />\nin technique.

Ludden arrives carrying a large cup<br />\nof hot tea with lemon to correct a 'very bad throat which<br />\nmakes him sound like a frog.<br />\nHe explains the basic ground<br />\nrules of the game and then begins throwing questions. Hopkins answers two-thirds or better of the toss-ups and the<br />\ngirls' composure (unshaken up<br />\nto now) begins to slip.<br />\n12:00\u2014Teams, coaches, and<br />\nalternates go to the Sheraton<br />\nfor lunch with the producer of<br />\nthe show. The team members<br />\nare at their most charming and<br />\ngracious levels of conscientious<br />\nattention.<br />\n1:00 P.M.\u2014Rehearsal with<br />\nprops begins, conducted under<br />\nshow conditions. Hopkins takes<br />\nseveral very obscure toss-ups<br />\nand bonuses, gassing the girls<br />\neven worse. The girls begin to<br />\nbe a little alarmed not only because the Hopkins team knows<br />\nthe answers, but because they<br />\nalso know the questions. (At<br />\nleast half of the questions used<br />\nat rehearsals came from old<br />\nshows or from the book now on<br />\nnewsstands.) At the end of the<br />\nfirst half, the score stands Hopkins 150, Sweetbriar-5. Final<br />\nscore, Hopkins 250, Sweetbriar,<br />\n70.<br /><br />\n2:30\u2014Second rehearsal. Hopkins continues in usual style.<br />\nFinal score, Hopkins 325, Sweetbriar 25. As the final whistle<br />\nblows, one of the Sweetbriar<br />\ngirls faints. She is revived quickly and carried upstairs to their<br />\ndressing room. Hopkins team<br />\nfaintly amused.<br />\nBut I. digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.<br />\nA doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears<br />\ngreen,a master of arts wears white,a doctor of humanities wears<br />\ncrimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?<br />\nWhy,for example,should a master of library science wear lemon<br />\nyellow?<br />\nWell sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to<br />\nMarch 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the<br />\nUnited States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.<br />\nSigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful\u2014all, that<br />\nis, except Wrex Todhunter.<br />\nMr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both<br />\nmen had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had<br />\nchosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.<br />\nSigafoos knew all the latest steps,like the Missouri Compromise<br />\nMambo the Shay's Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.<br />\nPolk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all<br />\nowing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.<br />\n(He was struck by a falling praline.)<br />\nConsumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos's<br />\nlibrary, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.<br />\nThis he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.<br />\nSigafoos.\"What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven't got?\" Mr.<br />\nTodhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to<br />\nhim: books.<br />\nSo Mr.Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books<br />\nand soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.<br />\nBut Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began<br />\nserving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea.<br />\nwith sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with<br />\nsugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving<br />\ntea with sugar and cream and lemon.<br />\nThis, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter because he had the only lemon tree in town\u2014in fact, in the entire<br />\nstate of North Dakota\u2014and since that day lemon yellow has of<br />\ncourse been the color on the academic robes of library science.<br />\n(Incidentally, the defeated Mr.Sigafoos packed up his library<br />\nand moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There<br />\nwere, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,<br />\nalas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced<br />\nto California until 1931 by John Wayne.)<br />\ne 1961 Max Shulman<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nAnd today Californians, happy among their Guernseys and<br />\nHolsteins, are discovering a great new cigarette\u2014the unfiltered, king-size Philip Morris Commander\u2014and so are<br /><br />\nAmericans in all fifty states.

To an appreciative audience of moderate size, Dr.<br />\nBryllion Fagin, Associate Professor of English and Drama<br />\n(Ret.), delivered a talk on \"The<br />\nNew Drama in the United States<br />\nand Europe\".<br /><br />\nrevivals of Ibsen and O'Casey.<br />\nDespite this, Dr. Fagin felt that<br />\n\"We have created a generation<br />\nof people who are competent,<br />\nand that is'a curse because more<br />\nemphasis is placed on the slick<br />\nand the good, or rather on the<br />\nhow, and not the what.\" In short<br />\nwe have tension or suspense engendered into our plays, but we<br />\nhave nothing to say.<br /><br />\nSeveral basic points were<br />\nbrought out by Dr. Fagin. In<br />\nhis opinion, the majority of<br />\ncontemporary drama is typified<br />\nby a lack of substance, a lack<br />\nof strong characterization, and<br />\nthe use of technique to cover up<br />\nmissing imagination. Also Dr.<br />\nFagin felt that only three countries were worth discussing:<br />\nFrance, England, and the United<br />\nStates.<br /><br />\nOn turning to France, Dr.<br />\nFagin had only praise for the<br />\nworks of Camus, Sartre, Becket,<br />\nGenet, and Ionesco. However,<br />\nhe found that here there was<br />\ntoo much of an attempt to graft<br />\nlines that will go well on stage<br />\ninto the plays. Another fault<br />\nfound by Dr. Fagin is that a<br />\nman like Ione,sco works. the<br />\nthemes of his play to death, or<br />\nthat Beckett keeps stressing the<br />\ntheme of pessimism without<br />\nreaching any climax. Despite<br />\nthese drawbacks, plays like<br />\nGenet's The Blacks, and Alpuna's The Condemned have a<br />\ngreat deal to say.<br /><br />\nAmerican drama has disappointed Dr. Fagin with a<br />\nPaucity of creativeness shown<br />\nby modern playwrights, as well<br />\nas the reliance of producers on<br />\neither biographies or on the<br />\ndramatization of novels or television scripts. Dr. Fagin complained that today's plays do<br />\nnot deal with the basic problems<br />\nthat concern us; in short, one<br />\ndoes not come away with any<br />\ntype of message.<br />\nThe Present Hope<br />\nOff Broadway, however, provides some hope for the American Theatre\u2014contributing playwrights like Jack Richardson and<br />\nEdward Albee, and many fine<br /><br />\nEnglish Social Drama<br />\nIn<br />\nEnglish' drama<br />\nthere<br />\nemerges a new wave of playwrights who have something to<br />\nsay, and who are not interested<br />\nin technique.
