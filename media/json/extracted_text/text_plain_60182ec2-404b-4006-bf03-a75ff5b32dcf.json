Before this<br />\nproblem can be attacked,<br />\nit<br />\nmust be ascertained exactly what<br />\nare the functions of the Student<br />\nCouncil. And before even this<br />\ncan be approached, there must<br />\nbe serious and lengthy debate<br />\nupon the real purpose of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nRe-Evaluation Called For<br />\nTherefore I proPose the following as my platform:<br />\n(1) That the new Student<br />\nCouncil should re-evaluate its<br />\nentire program..That the committee system which has existed<br />\nfor years be changed to eliminate such obvious anachronisms<br />\nas the \"Traffic Committee.\"<br />\nThat the Student Council police<br />\nits own ranks so that whatever<br />\ncourse of action is decided as<br />\nnecessary, enough members are<br />\npresent to carry it to fruition.<br />\n(2) That the Council get down<br />\nto the business of really representing the student body to off<br />\ncampus groups. That it poll the<br />\nstudent body when an issue<br />\narises. I can cite two examples<br />\nof instances where the Council<br />\nfailed to do this. One was when<br />\nwe were asked by the Brandeis<br />\nStudent Council to take a stand<br />\non the movie \"Operation Abolition.\" Another was when- students of the undergraduate body<br />\nstarted a sit-in movement and it<br />\nwas impossible<br />\nto<br />\nestimate<br />\nwhether this really represented<br />\nthe opinion of the Student Body.<br />\nIt is in situations like this that<br />\nthe Council must act on the behalf of the entire student body<br />\nand to do so it must measure<br />\nstudent opinion.<br />\nRevise Student Government<br />\n(3) That the Student Council<br />\nreview the relations of the Student Government with the Administration. To be rather blunt,<br />\nwe are not really certain now<br />\nwhere we stand and where the<br />\n(Cor.tinued on Page 4)<br />\n<br />\nThis year the Student Council<br />\nhas been faced with a number of<br />\nserious problems that councils<br />\nin the past several years didn't<br />\nhave to face. Many meetings<br />\nhave been called off due to failure to obtain a quorum; activities have been planned and then<br />\ncancelled; true student opinion<br />\nhas not been reflected; and<br />\nmany meetings were wasted by<br />\nquibbling over the role of the<br />\ncouncil with respect to other<br />\norganizations.<br />\nThis was a unique year, for<br />\nthis is the first time that the<br />\nCouncil has been needlessly plagued with being unable to plan<br />\nand execute a program of activities that truly have served the<br />\nentire student body and one that<br />\nhas tried to boost school pride<br />\nand spirit.<br />\nBoost Needed<br />\nThe most effective way to give<br />\nthe student body a shot in the<br />\narm for spirit boosting is to<br />\ngive the council a shot in the<br />\narm by solving the quorum problem. Poor attendance was caused<br />\nby several, members' beliefs that<br />\nthe council was accomplishing<br />\nnothing and that there was no<br />\nopportunity for them to contribute to school projects.<br />\nIf a good solid grasp of activities could be planned for this<br />\nspring by the new council, then<br />\nI believe the members would feel<br />\nthat they had an opportunity<br />\nto contribute to the well-being<br />\nof the Homewood community,<br />\nand thus the quorum problem<br />\nwould disappear.<br />\nSuggested Plans<br />\nSuch activities should include<br />\nplans for HOmecoming, spring<br />\ndances, parents day, interesting<br />\nassembly programs, and the<br />\npublication of a freshman handbook.<br />\nThe council should serve as a<br />\nforum where the opinions of the<br />\nentire student body can be represented and not just the opinions of its members.

What Mr, Sigafoos deplores\u2014indeed, what we all deplore<br />\n\u2014is the lopsided result of today's science courses: graduates<br />\nWho can build a bridge but can't compose a concerto, who know<br />\nPlanck's Constant but not Botticelli's Venus, who are familiar<br />\nwith Fraunhofer's lines but not with Schiller's.<br />\nMr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this hideous imbalance.<br />\nI, however, believe there is one\u2014and a very simple one. It is<br />\nthis: if students of s'cience don't have time. to come to the arts,<br />\nthen we ihust fet the arts come to students of science.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry<br />\nand music right along with physics. Students, instead of merely<br />\nbeing called upon to recite in physics class, would instead be<br />\nrequired to rhyme their answers and set them to familial tunes<br />\n\u2014like, foll instance, The Colonel Bogey March. Thus recitations<br />\nWould not only be chock-full of important facts but would, at<br />\nthe same time, expose the student to the aesthetic delights of<br />\ngreat music. Here, try it yourself.

The Oxford-Cambridge team is playing a sixteen<br />\ngame schedule against many of<br />\nthe Eastern Seaboard collegiate<br />\nteams.<br />\n<br />\nBy JOEL GORDON<br />\nThis spring, as every other spring, each Hopkins<br />\nteam will not reach its peak performance till half the<br />\nseason is over, giving each of its opponents an advantage.<br />\nThe blame can't be put on player or coach but rather<br />\non the Baltimore weather and the complete absence of<br />\nindoor practice facilities at Hopkins. Only because of its<br />\nwealth of talent' have the lacrosse and tennis teams been<br />\nable to post their good reeords.<br />\nEach spring the story is the same; only a few details<br />\nchange. Last year it snowed and this year it rained.<br />\nBoth years every team was forced to use the gym for<br />\npractices. With only enough room to hold three basketball<br />\ngames on undersized courts, Homewood Gym doesn't provide the facilities needed for the more expansive sports<br />\nlike lacrosse and baseball. With five teams, ten including<br />\nthe freshman squads, clamoring for the much needed practice in the undersized gym with only two hours open, a<br />\nrainy day' can be considered a wasted day.<br />\nThis year in order to prepare for its competition the<br />\nlacrosse team was forced to risk injury by practicing in<br />\nthe iquagmire that was the lower field. The baseball team<br />\nwas forced to retreat indoors to escape the cold that reeks<br />\nhavoc on arms and legs that are seeking to get into shape.<br />\nIn \u2022order to get into shape in their closed quarters they<br />\nplayed volleyball, which is not too much like baseball.<br />\nAs the first half of the spring sports season gets under<br />\nway, the Jays in all departments will be forced to compete against teams who gradually reached their top form<br />\nunder the optimum conditions. What do they have that<br />\nwe don't have? A field house where the track team can<br />\nrun, the baseball team can have infield and pitching drills,<br />\nthe lacrosse squad can have practice space and still leave<br />\nroom to set up a tennis net. Many a fieldhouse raises<br />\nspectator sports emphasis.<br />\nIt is about time that those who are concern'ed with<br />\nthe future of Hopkins athletics think of providing better<br />\nfacilities so that Jay teams can do battle at full strength.<br />\n<br />\n111...fk.<br />\n4.<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "\u2022iirttrr<br /><br />\nVOL.

Before this<br />\nproblem can be attacked,<br />\nit<br />\nmust be ascertained exactly what<br />\nare the functions of the Student<br />\nCouncil. And before even this<br />\ncan be approached, there must<br />\nbe serious and lengthy debate<br />\nupon the real purpose of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nRe-Evaluation Called For<br />\nTherefore I proPose the following as my platform:<br />\n(1) That the new Student<br />\nCouncil should re-evaluate its<br />\nentire program..That the committee system which has existed<br />\nfor years be changed to eliminate such obvious anachronisms<br />\nas the \"Traffic Committee.\"<br />\nThat the Student Council police<br />\nits own ranks so that whatever<br />\ncourse of action is decided as<br />\nnecessary, enough members are<br />\npresent to carry it to fruition.<br />\n(2) That the Council get down<br />\nto the business of really representing the student body to off<br />\ncampus groups. That it poll the<br />\nstudent body when an issue<br />\narises. I can cite two examples<br />\nof instances where the Council<br />\nfailed to do this. One was when<br />\nwe were asked by the Brandeis<br />\nStudent Council to take a stand<br />\non the movie \"Operation Abolition.\" Another was when- students of the undergraduate body<br />\nstarted a sit-in movement and it<br />\nwas impossible<br />\nto<br />\nestimate<br />\nwhether this really represented<br />\nthe opinion of the Student Body.<br />\nIt is in situations like this that<br />\nthe Council must act on the behalf of the entire student body<br />\nand to do so it must measure<br />\nstudent opinion.<br />\nRevise Student Government<br />\n(3) That the Student Council<br />\nreview the relations of the Student Government with the Administration.

Many meetings<br />\nhave been called off due to failure to obtain a quorum; activities have been planned and then<br />\ncancelled; true student opinion<br />\nhas not been reflected; and<br />\nmany meetings were wasted by<br />\nquibbling over the role of the<br />\ncouncil with respect to other<br />\norganizations.<br />\nThis was a unique year, for<br />\nthis is the first time that the<br />\nCouncil has been needlessly plagued with being unable to plan<br />\nand execute a program of activities that truly have served the<br />\nentire student body and one that<br />\nhas tried to boost school pride<br />\nand spirit.<br />\nBoost Needed<br />\nThe most effective way to give<br />\nthe student body a shot in the<br />\narm for spirit boosting is to<br />\ngive the council a shot in the<br />\narm by solving the quorum problem. Poor attendance was caused<br />\nby several, members' beliefs that<br />\nthe council was accomplishing<br />\nnothing and that there was no<br />\nopportunity for them to contribute to school projects.<br />\nIf a good solid grasp of activities could be planned for this<br />\nspring by the new council, then<br />\nI believe the members would feel<br />\nthat they had an opportunity<br />\nto contribute to the well-being<br />\nof the Homewood community,<br />\nand thus the quorum problem<br />\nwould disappear.<br />\nSuggested Plans<br />\nSuch activities should include<br />\nplans for HOmecoming, spring<br />\ndances, parents day, interesting<br />\nassembly programs, and the<br />\npublication of a freshman handbook.<br />\nThe council should serve as a<br />\nforum where the opinions of the<br />\nentire student body can be represented and not just the opinions of its members.

What Mr, Sigafoos deplores\u2014indeed, what we all deplore<br />\n\u2014is the lopsided result of today's science courses: graduates<br />\nWho can build a bridge but can't compose a concerto, who know<br />\nPlanck's Constant but not Botticelli's Venus, who are familiar<br />\nwith Fraunhofer's lines but not with Schiller's.<br />\nMr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this hideous imbalance.<br />\nI, however, believe there is one\u2014and a very simple one. It is<br />\nthis: if students of s'cience don't have time. to come to the arts,<br />\nthen we ihust fet the arts come to students of science.<br /><br />\nFor example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry<br />\nand music right along with physics. Students, instead of merely<br />\nbeing called upon to recite in physics class, would instead be<br />\nrequired to rhyme their answers and set them to familial tunes<br />\n\u2014like, foll instance, The Colonel Bogey March. Thus recitations<br />\nWould not only be chock-full of important facts but would, at<br />\nthe same time, expose the student to the aesthetic delights of<br />\ngreat music. Here, try it yourself.

All together, this interconnecting equipment makes up the heart of what<br />\nis, in effect, the world's largest machine.<br />\nThat's where Western Electric and you<br />\ncome in. The switching equipment for this<br />\ninvolves an enormous manufacturing job carried on by our plants throughout<br />\nthe country. Because of the size and service<br />\nrequirements involved, we require quality<br />\nstandards far exceeding those of ordinary<br />\nmanufacturing. The size of this job presents<br />\nan unusual challenge to the engineer who may<br />\nsave the Bell System many thousands of dollars<br />\nby even a small cost-reduction step.<br />\nWhile today's switching calls for a priority<br />\non engineering, tomorrow's will be even more<br />\nexciting. For even now the revolutionary Electronic Central Office is under field trial and<br />\npromises to remake the world of telephony.<br />\nFuture Western Electric engineers, working<br />\nclosely with their counterparts at Bell Tele-<br /><br />\n\"<br />\nmachine<br />\n\"<br /><br />\nphone Laboratories, will concentrate heavily<br />\non developing manufacturing methods for this<br />\nECO equipment.<br />\nYour Western Electric assignments may<br />\ncover many of our other responsibilities as<br />\nthe world's leading communications manufacturer.

Only because of its<br />\nwealth of talent' have the lacrosse and tennis teams been<br />\nable to post their good reeords.<br />\nEach spring the story is the same; only a few details<br />\nchange. Last year it snowed and this year it rained.<br />\nBoth years every team was forced to use the gym for<br />\npractices. With only enough room to hold three basketball<br />\ngames on undersized courts, Homewood Gym doesn't provide the facilities needed for the more expansive sports<br />\nlike lacrosse and baseball. With five teams, ten including<br />\nthe freshman squads, clamoring for the much needed practice in the undersized gym with only two hours open, a<br />\nrainy day' can be considered a wasted day.<br />\nThis year in order to prepare for its competition the<br />\nlacrosse team was forced to risk injury by practicing in<br />\nthe iquagmire that was the lower field.

What do they have that<br />\nwe don't have? A field house where the track team can<br />\nrun, the baseball team can have infield and pitching drills,<br />\nthe lacrosse squad can have practice space and still leave<br />\nroom to set up a tennis net.
