Also, that country has long played a part in<br />\nthe political development of the<br />\nFar East.<br />\nLodge cited the war in Vietnam as one more event in a long<br />\nseries of Communist aggressions<br />\nand as an open encounter with<br />\nthe \"wars of revolution\" which<br />\nare fundamental to Communist<br />\ndoctrine. He stated that North<br />\nVietnam is backed by the Chinese, and that American efforts<br />\nin the South will probably answer the question of whether<br />\nthe Chinese Communists can be<br />\ncontained on the Asian mainland. He said that a Communist<br />\nsuccess in Vietnam would lead<br />\nthe Soviet Union to take a more<br />\n\"bellicose\" view toward the West.<br />\nLodge said that our efforts in<br />\nVietnam have not been in vain.<br />\nThey have resulted in an able<br />\norganization and a trained military. American social aid has<br />\nprovided hospitals, schools, and<br />\n<br />\ninformation to the people.<br />\nMr. Lodge advocated continuation of the civil and military<br />\nplans already laid down by the<br />\nAdministration. He maintained<br />\nthat Vietnam is not a local war,<br />\nand that weapons, supplies, and<br />\ndirections come to the Viet Cong<br />\nfrom the North.<br />\nHe stated that the question as<br />\nto ways in which a settlement<br />\ncan be reached has not seemed<br />\nto have been considered in Communist countries. Lodge said<br />\nthat. \"Peaceful words without<br />\npeaceful behavior are misleading and dangerous.\"<br />\nIn explaining the nature of<br />\nthe war, Lodge related that Vietnam has seen the advent of a<br />\nnew fighting man\u2014the terrorist.<br />\nHe is supposedly part of a highly<br />\norganized, efficiently trained, and<br />\nwell directed association. The<br />\n<br />\nHENRY CABOT LODGE<br />\n<br />\nformer ambassador said that<br />\nterrorism is the life supply of<br />\nthe Viet Cong.<br />\nMr. Lodge said that, although<br />\nour help opposes the traditions<br />\nof the Vietnamese, we must be<br />\npatient. He quoted Mao Tse<br />\nTung's statement, \"Politics is<br />\nwar without bloodshed, and thus<br />\nwar is politics with bloodshed.\"<br />\nLodge stated that there is no<br />\nquick or simple or strictly military solution to the Vietnam<br />\ncrisis, and that the greatest<br />\nsingle danger to free society is<br />\nterrorism and subversion. He<br />\nsaid, \"Stalemate is much better<br />\nthan a defeat.\"<br />\nIn answering a question on<br />\nwhether \"calm\" can be restored<br />\nto the area by our present methods, Lodge replied that \"punitive actions\" will make North<br />\nVietnam see that their aggression is impractical and that<br />\neconomic aid and anti-terrorist<br />\nmeasures in the South will better<br />\nthe American position.<br />\nFollowing his speech. Mr.<br />\nLodge was the guest of the<br />\nYoung Republicans at a buffet<br />\nheld in the Great Hall in Levering.

Ho! The Hoppies really mocked themselves<br />\non Wednesday night. Though the Intermok rally proved<br />\nabortive, the audience comprised mainly of infantile<br />\nfreshman dorm inhabitants, made a real show of themselves. Loud childishness and threats of violence were<br />\nfeatured, with a supporting cast long on idiocy as it<br />\nwas short on humor'. We were surprised that INTERMOK<br />\nfell, but it did not fail. In lieu of the expected speakers,<br />\nthe HAPPENING of that evening was spontaneous an,<br />\nand its message had to do with the idiocy of those who<br />\ntold a story they did not understand. 1NTERMOK was<br />\nrevived on its potential death bed who intended to insure<br />\nits fall.<br />\n<br />\nPrincess In The Making<br />\nWe are given to wonder at the abundance of cultural and political presentations at the Homewood this<br />\nspring.

The \"Big<br />\nWeekend\" dance, or so it was<br />\ncalled, resembled the poorest of<br />\nthe movie-mixers. Hank Ballard<br />\nnever showed his face; the backup group was missing its seventh<br />\nmember, and took break so long<br />\nthat it appeared to have two engagements that evening. There<br />\nwas no slow dance music to be<br />\nhad, even at 1230 A.M.<br />\n<br />\nfruleace<br />\n<br />\nFor five dollars we received<br />\ntwo hours of -music\", exorbitant<br />\nfood and parking prices, and an<br />\nextremely poor band. I call for<br />\nthe 1PC to give a 50% rebate to<br />\nticket-buyers, and to turn organization of the dance over to a<br />\ngroup of more efficient, responsible individuals; an ad hoc committee would be a suggestion.<br />\n<br />\nLastly, I would suggest that<br />\neven should the dance be a financial failure, ticket purchasers<br />\nare entitled to what they have<br />\npaid for.

Also, that country has long played a part in<br />\nthe political development of the<br />\nFar East.<br />\nLodge cited the war in Vietnam as one more event in a long<br />\nseries of Communist aggressions<br />\nand as an open encounter with<br />\nthe \"wars of revolution\" which<br />\nare fundamental to Communist<br />\ndoctrine. He stated that North<br />\nVietnam is backed by the Chinese, and that American efforts<br />\nin the South will probably answer the question of whether<br />\nthe Chinese Communists can be<br />\ncontained on the Asian mainland. He said that a Communist<br />\nsuccess in Vietnam would lead<br />\nthe Soviet Union to take a more<br />\n\"bellicose\" view toward the West.<br />\nLodge said that our efforts in<br />\nVietnam have not been in vain.<br />\nThey have resulted in an able<br />\norganization and a trained military. American social aid has<br />\nprovided hospitals, schools, and<br /><br />\ninformation to the people.<br />\nMr. Lodge advocated continuation of the civil and military<br />\nplans already laid down by the<br />\nAdministration. He maintained<br />\nthat Vietnam is not a local war,<br />\nand that weapons, supplies, and<br />\ndirections come to the Viet Cong<br />\nfrom the North.<br />\nHe stated that the question as<br />\nto ways in which a settlement<br />\ncan be reached has not seemed<br />\nto have been considered in Communist countries.

The<br /><br />\nHENRY CABOT LODGE<br /><br />\nformer ambassador said that<br />\nterrorism is the life supply of<br />\nthe Viet Cong.<br />\nMr. Lodge said that, although<br />\nour help opposes the traditions<br />\nof the Vietnamese, we must be<br />\npatient. He quoted Mao Tse<br />\nTung's statement, \"Politics is<br />\nwar without bloodshed, and thus<br />\nwar is politics with bloodshed.\"<br />\nLodge stated that there is no<br />\nquick or simple or strictly military solution to the Vietnam<br />\ncrisis, and that the greatest<br />\nsingle danger to free society is<br />\nterrorism and subversion. He<br />\nsaid, \"Stalemate is much better<br />\nthan a defeat.\"<br />\nIn answering a question on<br />\nwhether \"calm\" can be restored<br />\nto the area by our present methods, Lodge replied that \"punitive actions\" will make North<br />\nVietnam see that their aggression is impractical and that<br />\neconomic aid and anti-terrorist<br />\nmeasures in the South will better<br />\nthe American position.<br />\nFollowing his speech.

Ho! The Hoppies really mocked themselves<br />\non Wednesday night. Though the Intermok rally proved<br />\nabortive, the audience comprised mainly of infantile<br />\nfreshman dorm inhabitants, made a real show of themselves. Loud childishness and threats of violence were<br />\nfeatured, with a supporting cast long on idiocy as it<br />\nwas short on humor'. We were surprised that INTERMOK<br />\nfell, but it did not fail. In lieu of the expected speakers,<br />\nthe HAPPENING of that evening was spontaneous an,<br />\nand its message had to do with the idiocy of those who<br />\ntold a story they did not understand. 1NTERMOK was<br />\nrevived on its potential death bed who intended to insure<br />\nits fall.<br /><br />\nPrincess In The Making<br />\nWe are given to wonder at the abundance of cultural and political presentations at the Homewood this<br />\nspring. We wonder whether the occasions are just petals<br />\nof a premature and temporary flower, and whether<br />\nwe've not delighted in glamour beyond our means.<br />\nThe importation of Francis Hinsley from Cambridge, the weekly and hi-weekly consultation and verbal<br />\nplay with the boys from Washington, rubbing shoulders<br />\nwith Presidents, sheiks and fezzes, climaxing in the<br />\nfruition of Intermok, bespeak a wondrous new activity<br />\nof Hopkins.<br />\nLeaving no piece unturned, The YMCA has invited<br />\nHugh Hefner to tell his story; no doubt to clue us in<br />\non how to handle a moral situation in the makings of a<br />\nprince and, who knows, maybe a princess or two.<br />\nIt's now \"the thing\" to be a Hoppie. 1500 fellows<br />\nbecome einderelias of a cultured world if only by association.

The \"Big<br />\nWeekend\" dance, or so it was<br />\ncalled, resembled the poorest of<br />\nthe movie-mixers. Hank Ballard<br />\nnever showed his face; the backup group was missing its seventh<br />\nmember, and took break so long<br />\nthat it appeared to have two engagements that evening. There<br />\nwas no slow dance music to be<br />\nhad, even at 1230 A.M.<br /><br />\nfruleace<br /><br />\nFor five dollars we received<br />\ntwo hours of -music\", exorbitant<br />\nfood and parking prices, and an<br />\nextremely poor band. I call for<br />\nthe 1PC to give a 50% rebate to<br />\nticket-buyers, and to turn organization of the dance over to a<br />\ngroup of more efficient, responsible individuals; an ad hoc committee would be a suggestion.<br /><br />\nLastly, I would suggest that<br />\neven should the dance be a financial failure, ticket purchasers<br />\nare entitled to what they have<br />\npaid for. Certainly we won't want<br />\nto go to the dances next year<br />\nFor students bringing their with this sort of a track record.<br />\ngirls down for a big college weekRobert R.

It seems to me<br />\nthat any efficient organizing body<br />\nwould take out insurance on the<br />\nfact that the bands will show up,<br />\nin order to provide for a rebate<br />\nto students.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSome four weeks ago I sent<br />\na letter to the office of Mr. Robert P. Bilgrave, Director of Admissions for Johns Hopkins, in<br />\nwhich I suggested that the University should no longer require<br />\napplicants to the undergraduate<br />\nschool to affix photographs to<br />\ntheir applications, in order to give<br />\ngreater assurance that no racial<br /><br />\ndiscrimination is practiced in the<br />\nUniversity's admissions policy. I<br />\ngave what seemed to me a workable alternative plan by which<br />\nthe purpose served by the photographs would be otherwise provided for, and made one or two<br />\nother proposals as well. I requested a reply from Mr. Bilgraves' office.<br />\nTwo weeks later I went to the<br />\nAdmissions Office to find out<br />\nwhy I had got no answer. A<br />\ngentleman there informed me<br />\nthat my letter was \"on his desk\",<br />\nand that he would answer it as<br />\nsoon as he was through with<br />\nthe business of selecting the new<br />\nfreshman class.<br />\nIt is now two weeks after that.<br />\nMaybe Mr. Bilgrave'c colleagues<br />\nhave in fact been so busy for<br />\nfour solid weeks that they have<br />\nfound no time to answer my<br />\nletter: but I think that their<br />\nattitude is clear, and is not theirs<br />\nalone: be the occasion student<br />\noutrage at the evil lies of McGeorge Bundy, or student protest<br />\nat racial discrimination, students<br />\nare disruptive, out of order, and<br />\nnot to be heard.<br /><br />\nUgly, Kan!
