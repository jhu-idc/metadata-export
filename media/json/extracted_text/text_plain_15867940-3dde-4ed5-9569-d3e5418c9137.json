Annapolis and attempted to incinerate<br />\nthe huge pile of boxwood that had<br />\nbeen piled high by the St. John's<br />\nstudents. On this pile \"Dear Old<br />\nJohnny Hopkins\" was later burned<br />\nin effigy. The attempts of the<br />\nHopkins students to burn the wood<br />\nwere unsuccessful and a tussle between the students and Annapolis<br />\npolice ensued and a couple men<br />\nwere taken to the lock-up for the<br />\nnight, but were later released.<br />\nThe situation this year was on a<br />\nmuch larger scale and involved a<br />\ngreater number of students. A<br />\nlarge group of the Hopkins men<br />\nwere thrown into the jail while<br />\nonly a couple St. John's men were<br />\nput in the lock-up. Why this should<br />\nhave happened we cannot understand. We feel that if the police<br />\nand firem1m had allowed the students of the two institutions to have<br />\ntheir tussles and had not interfered,<br />\nthat a great amount of the extra<br />\nrumpus would not have occurred<br />\nand none of the students would<br />\nhave been jailed or fined. The law<br />\nand the fire department have their<br />\nplace in society, are a necessity and<br />\ndo an untold amount of good to the<br />\nfurthering of civilization and the<br />\nprotection of property, but we feel<br />\nthat they should haYe adopted a<br />\npolicy of \"hands off\" and allowed<br />\nthe fracas to reach its natural end<br />\nwithout their assistance.<br />\n<br />\n---o--GOOD WORK<br />\nThe jinx which had o'ershadowed<br />\nthe John Hopkins football team for<br />\nthe past three years was on a vacation last Saturday, and the Jays<br />\ngave the Crabtown eleven a decided trouncing when they met for<br />\ntheir annual tussel on the gridiron.<br />\nThe score of 20 to 13 does not denote a victory with a agreat margin,<br />\nbut the Johnnies took an awful<br />\nbeating from the hands of the Jays<br />\nwhich they will not soon forget.<br />\nIn 1928 and 1929 they defeated<br />\nus by large scores and last year, on<br />\na very sloppy field, the Johnnies<br />\nwere able to register four touch-\u00b7<br />\ndowns to our one.

Right and<br />\nwrong are relative, and the moral<br />\ncode is set by existing and changing conditions.<br />\nTraces Illiberality<br />\n<br />\nHe traced much of the extreme<br />\nilliberality that exists today to the<br />\nneed that people feel for some<br />\nstraw of dogma to cling to, \"as a<br />\ndrowning per.son clings to wreck-\u00b7<br />\nage.\" They find themselves casi<br />\nsuddenly upon a world of startling<br />\nbreadth of opinions, and seize desperately at any anchor of morai<br />\nprinciple, be that principle suited<br />\nto modern conditions, or not.<br />\nThe shortness and basic unimportance of the average life is, according to Dr. Mitchell, a potent<br />\nfactor in the development of liberal~<br />\nism. The proper course is for<br />\npeople to recognise the presence<br />\nand necessity of change and to aid<br />\nin turning the course of that change<br />\nin the right direction.

The<br />\nhappenings of last Thursday night,<br />\nalthoug\u00b7h not entirely unheard of<br />\nbefore, were on a larger scale than<br />\nthe tussles of previous years.<br />\nLast year a small body of Hopkins' students drove down to. Annapolis and attempted to incinerate<br />\nthe huge pile of boxwood that had<br />\nbeen piled high by the St. John's<br />\nstudents. On this pile \"Dear Old<br />\nJohnny Hopkins\" was later burned<br />\nin effigy. The attempts of the<br />\nHopkins students to burn the wood<br />\nwere unsuccessful and a tussle between the students and Annapolis<br />\npolice ensued and a couple men<br />\nwere taken to the lock-up for the<br />\nnight, but were later released.<br />\nThe situation this year was on a<br />\nmuch larger scale and involved a<br />\ngreater number of students. A<br />\nlarge group of the Hopkins men<br />\nwere thrown into the jail while<br />\nonly a couple St. John's men were<br />\nput in the lock-up. Why this should<br />\nhave happened we cannot understand. We feel that if the police<br />\nand firem1m had allowed the students of the two institutions to have<br />\ntheir tussles and had not interfered,<br />\nthat a great amount of the extra<br />\nrumpus would not have occurred<br />\nand none of the students would<br />\nhave been jailed or fined.
