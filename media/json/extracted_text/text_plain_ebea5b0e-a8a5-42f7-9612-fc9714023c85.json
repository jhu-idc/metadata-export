She was accompanied by Mrs. Davis at the piano.<br />\nMrs. Stethens' first number was<br />\n\"Down in the Desert\" by Ross, followed by \"My Dear Soul,\" a<br />\nWessex love song, by Sanderson.<br />\nThe program was climaxed by<br />\n\"Che Faro Senza Eurydice\" from<br />\nGluck's opera \"Orfeo.\" The story<br />\nrelated to this selection concerns the<br />\nattempt of Orfeo to have his dead<br />\nsweetheart Eurydice restored to him.<br />\nThe gods consent to his pleadings<br />\non one condition\u2014that he go to the<br />\nunderworld and play for the girl he<br />\nloved. She would follow him, but<br />\nhe was admonished not to look back<br />\nat her until both had passed out of<br />\nHades. Orfeo could not resist the<br />\ntemptation, and Eurydice was lost<br />\nto him forever. The theme running<br />\nthrough the piece expresses Orfeo's<br />\nfeeling of complete helplessness.<br />\nS.

It is an unfailing guide<br />\nto cigarette selection and enjoyment.<br />\nAs you can quickly see by the three upper curves on<br />\nthis interesting chart, cigarettes that lack the protection of the Humidor Pack lose their moisture rapidly<br />\nfrom the day they are manufactured.<br />\nAnd day by day as this moisture disappears, the<br />\nsmoke from these cigarettes becomes harsher, hotter,<br />\nmore unkind to the smoker's throat.<br />\nNot so with Camels!<br />\nThe Humidor Pack is moisture proof and sealed airtight at every point. It protects the rich, flavorful<br /><br />\naroma of the choice Turkish and Domestic tobaccos<br />\nof which Camels are blended.<br />\nMake these tests yourself<br />\nIt is so easy to tell the difference between parched dry<br />\ncigarettes and fresh prime Camels that it is no wonder<br />\neverybody is reaching for afresh cigarette today.<br />\nYour fingers identify stale,dried-out tobaccos at once.<br />\nWhile a Camel is flexible and pliant.<br />\nYour ears can tell the difference too. For a dust-dry<br />\ncigarette crackles under pressure.<br />\nBut the real test is taste and there is simply no comparison between the rich mildness of a Camel and the<br />\nhot, brackish smoke from a stale, dry cigarette.<br />\nSwitch to Camels just for today then leave them<br />\ntomorrow if you can.<br />\nWinston-Salem, N.
