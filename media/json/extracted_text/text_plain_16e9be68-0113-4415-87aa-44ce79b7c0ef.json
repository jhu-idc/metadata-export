The number of students<br />\nin each course will be about<br />\nequal.<br />\n\"Since there is a natural division, the numbers are pretty<br />\nsimilar,\" said Wilson.<br />\nBoth Meyer and Wilson agreed<br />\nthat they would like to do the<br />\nsame with other large courses;<br />\nhowever, due to the unusually<br />\nsmall faculty in the Math Department, each professor has at least<br />\none large lecture class.<br />\nCurrently, the Math Department has 17 tenure track professors. Since one more instructor was hired this year, the<br />\ndepartment was able to split the<br />\ncourse.<br />\nWilson added that this is the<br />\nfirst time in thirty years that the<br />\nMath Department has increased<br />\nits staff.<br />\nHe believes that students will<br />\nbe happier as a result of the division. \"It is a more homogeneous<br />\npopulation from the student's<br />\npoint of view.

In the past<br />\n<br />\nyear, to enroll approximately 100<br />\nmore students, about 300 more<br />\nwere accepted than had been in<br />\npast years.<br />\nThe incoming freshmen have<br />\nselected a variety of majors.

As<br />\n840-odd freshmen sat rapt with attention, they heard how<br />\n40 percent of the class were humanities majors, 26 percent natural science, and 25 percent engineering. They also<br />\nheard, like many classes before them, that theirs was the<br />\nlargest class yet to pass through Hopkins' gates.<br />\nSuch a huge class has its advantages, such as loads of<br />\npeople in the dorms with whom to make friends. But the<br />\nsevere financial crunch affecting the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences has created increases in class size and tuition,<br />\nand reductions in the number of classes offered.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins is esteemed as one of the world's<br />\nleading research institutions, it is also identified with one<br />\nof the nation's most grievous liberal arts fiascos. The financial crisis that led in part to President Muller's resignation consists primarily of a $4 million deficit in the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences\u2014the University's center for<br />\nhumanities, liberal arts, and natural sciences.<br />\nTo solve the budget problems, a five-year plan was<br />\ncreated that sought to raise tuition, eliminate academic programs, and cut faculty costs via attrition. What this means,<br />\nfreshmen, is that your 14 grand, which does not cover<br />\nroom and board, books, a meal plan, or the cost of an oncampus movie, may be giving you less for your money<br />\nthan it gave previous incoming classes.<br />\nPerhaps the best example of Arts and Sciences' plight<br />\nis the Classics Department. With only one tenured faculty member, Professor Georg Luck, students who want to<br />\nstudy the works of Plato and Homer must look to instructors from other institutions to fill their heads with classical<br />\nphilosophy. If this trend continues, it won't be long until<br />\nother programs, such as the Near Eastern Studies Department, begin to feel the effects.<br />\nThe financial woes converging on Arts and Sciences are<br />\ndoubly discomforting when one considers that:<br />\n. Hopkins received more federal research and development<br />\ngrants in recent years than any university in the U.S.<br />\n($476.3 million in 1987; less than 4 percent went to Arts<br />\nand Sciences).<br />\n. In a recent campaign to raise money from private dona-<br />\n<br />\ntions, Hopkins raised over $500 million in the course of<br />\n5 years (8 percent went to Arts and Sciences).<br />\nSince the day Hopkins' doors opened in 1876, it has been<br />\nan institution geared towards research and graduate study.<br />\nHopkins was not intended as a springboard from which<br />\nadolescents could make their respective leaps into the<br />\nworld. The international pre-eminence of our medical insititutions and The Hubble Space Telescope Institute here<br />\nat Homewood are just two testaments to Hopkins' commitment to its research creed. Miracles happen every day<br />\nat Johns Hopkins Hospital, testament, too to the fruits of<br />\nthat commitment. Yet the doctors, researchers, and scientists who work these wonders weren't born with minds<br />\nsteeped in organic chemistry\u2014or with a pleasant bedside<br />\nmanner. The importance of an undergraduate education<br />\ncannot be overstated when social and academic development are at stake.<br />\nYet the University continues to play with fire. A pattern in the Arts and Sciences\u2014tuition and class size increases paired with reductions in faculty and programs\u2014<br />\ncan only hurt the students and ultimately Johns Hopkins<br />\nitself.

Like last<br />\nyear, I am camped in a remote<br />\narea where I am removed from<br />\nfireworks, cheesy small town<br />\nparades, and the excess of narrow<br />\nminded \"America is the best and<br />\ndon't you forget it\" hoopla. I<br />\nprefer isolation for this particular<br />\nholiday. Here in Fisher Caldera<br />\non Unimak Island in the Aleutian<br />\nchain, it is about 48 degrees this<br />\nafternoon. This is combined with<br />\n20 mph wind and light rain; sort<br />\nof like living inside a cloud. Certainly less than ideal camping<br />\nconditions. This is the worst<br />\nweather John and I have seen in<br />\nour 11 days here. Amazing how<br />\nwhat was paradise 24 hours ago,<br />\nnow feels like prison. If today<br />\nwere nice weather, the plane<br />\nwould be able to get in here and<br />\npick us up. We could get out of<br />\nhere and back to the thriving<br />\nmetropolis of Dutch Harbor. I<br />\ncould really go for a good mea!<br />\nand a shower right now.<br />\nYesterday was indeed paradise.<br />\nI normally enjoy sunny days and<br />\nreally rainy days, but not overcast days. Yesterday was one of<br />\nthose in between days. I never<br />\nthought an overcast day could be<br />\nso beautiful. It was a pleasant<br />\n55-60 degrees with virtually no<br />\nwind. Looking out over the<br />\nlargest lake in the caldera and taking in the unspoiled landscape<br />\nwas almost like a religious experience. No, not almost...it was.<br />\nFunny-looking ground squirrels<br />\nmaking obscure chirping noises<br />\nfrom their holes in the tundra, a<br />\npair of ducks diving for food in<br />\nthe lake...but best of all was the<br />\nnatural landscape. A landscape of<br />\nmagical beauty. The steep, lightly<br />\nvegetated slopes forming the<br />\nnorth rim of the caldera reminded me of the Pali cliffs on the<br />\n<br />\nwindward side of the Oahu.<br />\nThat's it, the Aleutians are like<br />\nHawaii...only colder. There are<br />\nof course some differences in the<br />\nvegetation and animal life; green<br />\ntundra with no trees versus palm<br />\ntrees and rain forest vegetation;<br />\ncaribou and wolves versus<br />\ntropical birds, but the landscape<br />\nof volcanoes and black sand<br />\nbeaches is identical. Put a couple<br />\ndozen hotels filled with Japanese<br />\ntourists on the south side of<br />\nUnimak and you have Waikiki.<br />\nAh, there's the difference. The<br />\nAleutians, Unimak in particular,<br />\nare undeveloped. There are of<br />\ncourse some fishing ports like<br />\nDutch Harbor, but most of the<br />\nlandscape has not been scarred by<br />\ncivilization. The native Aleut<br />\npeople, much like American Indians, lived off the land and the<br />\nsea. Evidence of their former<br />\npresence on these islands is fairly scarce.<br />\nAfter camping in this peaceful<br />\nsetting, I'm afraid every future<br />\ncamping experience will seem inferior. There is simply zero<br />\nevidence of man's presence in<br />\nthis area. Walking miles of lake<br />\nshore and seeing not a single soda<br />\ncan, cigarette butt or tangled<br />\nfishing line is pretty cool. The only sign of any animal life are<br />\nground squirrel and bird nests and<br />\nthe trails worn in the tundra by<br />\nbears crossing through the<br />\ncaldera. Our footprints spoil<br />\nsome muddy areas, but after the<br />\nwinter there will be no trace of<br />\nour presence here. No one will<br />\nnotice the smashed rocks we are<br />\nleaving behind, so next summer<br />\nsomeone else could visit the<br />\ncaldera and see it in its pristine<br />\nstate.<br />\nAll this clean air really does<br />\nsomething to my brain. When out<br />\nin the wilderness, be it the Aleutians, New Mexico, Nevada, or<br />\nwherever, I always get very<br />\nanalytical. This trip I've been<br />\n<br />\nthinking mostly about politics,<br />\nbut maybe that's because we have<br />\na radio and lots has been going<br />\non lately (flag burning, restricting<br />\nabortion rights). My mind seems<br />\nto be more sharp and active than<br />\nwhen in Baltimore. But this could<br />\nbe due to the absence of beer out<br />\nhere rather than the excess of<br />\nclean air. After our second day<br />\nof work, John and I were seriously regretting our not bringing a<br />\ncouple cases along. It's not like<br />\nwe couldn't keep it cold. The<br />\nstream we are camped next to<br />\nchecks in at 34 degrees F. If we<br />\nget out tomorrow and I can get<br />\na beer at the Ballyhoo lounge (the<br />\nbar in the Dutch Harbor airport),<br />\nit will end my beerless spell at 14<br />\ndays. For some, this is a long<br />\ntime to go without a beer. At this<br />\npoint, the only forces drawing me<br />\nback to Baltimore are 1) The<br />\ndesire to see and talk to more than<br />\none person all day every day, and<br />\n2) The desire to spend time at<br />\nPJ's.<br />\nUnimak is still fresh in my<br />\nmind as I sit in this air conditioned room back at Hopkins. Things<br />\nhave changed very little over the<br />\nsummer,though they did raise the<br />\nprice for Sunday pizza at Pis.<br />\nI'm actually glad to be in<br />\nBaltimore, however I probably<br />\nwon't feel this way a month from<br />\nnow. It's easy to laugh at big city life when one is removed from<br />\nit for a short time.

A parade of sordid New York .City imagery<br />\npasses before the camera: adult<br />\nmovie theaters, prostitutes haggling with clients. The audience<br />\nrecoils; it's as if they want to roll<br />\nup the car windows, lock the<br />\ndoors, and speed away.<br />\nThese beginning minutes are as<br />\npowerful and disturbing as<br />\nanything in \"Sea of Love,\"<br />\nwhich, perhaps, is not saying<br />\nmuch. Al Pacino is Homicide<br />\nDetective Frank Keller, a 20-year<br />\npolice veteran who drinks,<br />\n'brawls, and generally slmighs<br />\naround. His life doesn't seem to<br />\nhave much direction, perhaps<br />\nbecause his wife recently left him<br />\nfor another detective. And Keller,<br />\nnot surprisingly, has just been<br />\nassigned to a new case: A man<br />\nwas shot through the head, face<br />\ndown, lying on his bed while the<br />\n1959 ballad \"<br />\n.Sea of Love\"<br />\n<br />\nplayed endlessly on his turntable.<br />\nKeller has to find the murderer.<br />\nBut a second victim is soon<br />\ndiscovered, and Keller teams up<br />\nwith a fellow detective (John<br />\nGoodman). The two devise a plan<br />\nto trap the killer, who selects victims from the personal ads (and<br />\nwho also, apparently, has a flair<br />\nfor poetry). With the help of<br />\nKeller's father, the two detectives<br />\nwrite some verse of their own,<br />\nplace an ad, and wait for<br />\nresponses to pile up.<br />\nIt doesn't take long. As Keller<br />\n'interviews the respondents to the<br />\nad, who are all women, he has<br />\ntrouble separating his job as investigator from his urges as lonely guy. This is the conflict that<br />\nprovides the center for \"Sea of<br />\nLove,\" as Keller becomes sexually involved with Helen Cruger<br />\n(Ellen Barkin), who is, of course,<br />\nhis main suspect.<br />\nBarkin endows Cruger with a<br />\nsexuality that is strong but not<br />\noverbearing. She offsets moments<br />\nof murky eroticisfb with an occasional childlike grin; it leaves us<br />\n<br />\nguessing. And though we want<br />\nproof of Cruger's psychopathic<br />\nand sexually deviant side (we<br />\nhear about it often), she teases<br />\nmore than she titillates.<br />\nIt eventually becomes obvious<br />\nthat Keller is to be Cruger's next<br />\nvictim. Meanwhile, the part of<br />\nthe movie we haven't figured<br />\nout\u2014their \"torrid\" love affair\u2014<br />\nhas lost our interest. Pacino and<br />\nBarkin look uncomfortable and<br />\ntentative: there's nothing definite<br />\nin their scenes together, and they<br />\ntend to lapse into idiocy when<br />\nthey talk to each other (\"I feel<br />\nlike a big cat in a small cage\" and<br />\n\"you know what you know and<br />\nyou go with ii.\") What starts as<br />\nmere awkwardness balloons into<br />\nimplausibility.<br />\nPacino hasn't aged well. \"Sea<br />\nof Love\" is his firs film since<br />\n1985's \"Revolution\"(somewhat<br />\nless succesful than the original,<br />\n200 years earlier) and there's a<br />\ngood deal missing in his performance. \"Sea of Love,\" like<br />\n\"Fatal Attraction\" or \"Jagged<br />\nEdge,\" requires that its actors<br />\n<br />\n467-7188<br />\n<br />\n27th St. & Howard<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nMon Nile<br />\nFootball on<br />\nTwo 40\" TVs<br />\nFree Pizza and<br />\nWings at Half<br />\nTime<br />\n.50 Draft<br />\n$2.00 Meatball Sub<br />\n<br />\nTues Nite<br />\n<br />\nWed Nite<br />\n<br />\nPersonal Pizza<br />\n$1.95<br />\n1 Free Topping<br />\nCharl-Broiled<br />\nHamburger Build<br />\nYour Own Burger<br />\nWith Free<br />\nToppings....<br />\n$3.95<br />\n<br />\n.50 Pizza Slice<br />\n.75 Mug Nite<br />\n\"Buck a Bud\"<br />\n<br />\nThurs Nite<br />\nCollege Nite<br />\nSpecials on Pitchers, Drafts,<br />\nShooters...<br />\n16\" Pizza With<br />\nCheese... $5.00<br />\nPopular D.J.<br />\n9-10 All the Draft<br />\nyou Can Drink<br />\n$1.00<br />\n<br />\nFri Nite<br />\n<br />\nSat Nite<br />\n<br />\nSun Day<br />\n<br />\nSpaghetti and Meat<br />\nBall<br />\nGarlic Bread....<br />\n$4.95<br />\nSalad<br />\nCrab Special..$9.95<br />\nAll You Can EatBowl of Crab Soup<br />\nand Corn....7 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nOpen at Noon...<br />\nCollege Football on<br />\nBoth T.V.'s....<br />\nSub Specials All<br />\nDay<br />\nCrab ,Special..$9.95<br />\nAll you Can Eat<br />\nBowl of Crab Soup<br />\nand Corn...7 P.M.<br />\ntill...<br />\nPurchase any 16\"<br />\nPizza..get Pitcher<br />\nfor 1 cent (Beer or<br />\nCoke)<br />\n<br />\nComplete<br />\nBreakfast... $1.99<br />\nSunday Brunch...<br />\n11 till 2<br />\nN.F.L Football on<br />\nBoth T.V.'s<br />\nPizza Slices...$.50<br />\nTaco....$.50<br />\nDraft...$.50<br />\nHot Turkey or Ho<br />\nBeef with French<br />\nFries and Cole<br />\nSlaw...$4.95<br />\nStudent Special<br />\nDinners....

One of Pullen's<br />\ngreatest virtues as a player is his<br />\nsense of space and proportion.<br />\nFor every feverish right-hand<br />\nworkout, for each jangling cluster<br />\nof notes, he offers an opposing<br />\nchord or silence that seems to<br />\ncome from nowhere\u2014one might<br />\nbe hearing two different pianists.<br />\nThat contrast elegantly sup-<br />\n<br />\nports the six pieces on \"New<br />\nBeginnings\" (seven on CD),<br />\nwhich offer an emotional<br />\nvocabulary as sophisticated as<br />\nany in contemporary jazz.<br />\nPullen's trio takes a sentiment\u2014<br />\nor half a dozen of them\u2014and<br />\nmines them for everything they're<br />\nworth, taking banal ideas and<br />\nrecasting them with bold, unsparing virtuosity.<br />\nIn \"Once Upon A Time,\" for<br />\nexample, a joyful, bounding<br />\nbackbeat shoots forward from<br />\nmeasure to measure, as if<br />\nswallowing the song piecemeal.<br />\nIn the following tune, \"Warriors,\" this energy is replaced by<br />\nstreaks of guttural, pounding<br />\nanger. The transition, though<br />\nharsh, is effective: in the context<br />\nof the music, it seems natural.<br />\nThough Pullen is often at the<br />\ncenter of the storm on \"New<br />\nBeginnings,\" his economy as a<br />\nplayer is remarkable. Every note<br />\nhe plays is part of a larger<br />\nrhythmic fabric.

The decision to split the<br />\nclass was make by the Math<br />\nDepartment earlier this year after<br />\nthe addition of a new faculty<br />\nmember.<br />\n\"We had two populations with<br />\nslightly different needs,\" said<br />\nProfessor Jean-Pierre Meyer,<br />\nchairman of the Math Department. Meyer said that most<br />\nphysical science majors and<br />\nengineers will go on to take more<br />\nadvanced math courses, while<br />\nmost social science and biology<br />\nmajors will not.<br />\n\u2022 A second reason for splitting<br />\n(he course was to reduce the size<br />\nof large lectures..<br />\n\"The lectures were too large.<br />\nWe tried to find two populations<br />\nwithin the group, and this seemed to be a reasonable way to do<br />\nit,\" he said.<br />\n\u2022 \"Because a lot of people want<br />\nto take more math courses, they<br />\nwon't be taught on separate<br />\nlevels.

As<br />\n840-odd freshmen sat rapt with attention, they heard how<br />\n40 percent of the class were humanities majors, 26 percent natural science, and 25 percent engineering. They also<br />\nheard, like many classes before them, that theirs was the<br />\nlargest class yet to pass through Hopkins' gates.<br />\nSuch a huge class has its advantages, such as loads of<br />\npeople in the dorms with whom to make friends. But the<br />\nsevere financial crunch affecting the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences has created increases in class size and tuition,<br />\nand reductions in the number of classes offered.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins is esteemed as one of the world's<br />\nleading research institutions, it is also identified with one<br />\nof the nation's most grievous liberal arts fiascos. The financial crisis that led in part to President Muller's resignation consists primarily of a $4 million deficit in the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences\u2014the University's center for<br />\nhumanities, liberal arts, and natural sciences.<br />\nTo solve the budget problems, a five-year plan was<br />\ncreated that sought to raise tuition, eliminate academic programs, and cut faculty costs via attrition. What this means,<br />\nfreshmen, is that your 14 grand, which does not cover<br />\nroom and board, books, a meal plan, or the cost of an oncampus movie, may be giving you less for your money<br />\nthan it gave previous incoming classes.<br />\nPerhaps the best example of Arts and Sciences' plight<br />\nis the Classics Department. With only one tenured faculty member, Professor Georg Luck, students who want to<br />\nstudy the works of Plato and Homer must look to instructors from other institutions to fill their heads with classical<br />\nphilosophy. If this trend continues, it won't be long until<br />\nother programs, such as the Near Eastern Studies Department, begin to feel the effects.<br />\nThe financial woes converging on Arts and Sciences are<br />\ndoubly discomforting when one considers that:<br />\n. Hopkins received more federal research and development<br />\ngrants in recent years than any university in the U.S.<br />\n($476.3 million in 1987; less than 4 percent went to Arts<br />\nand Sciences).<br />\n. In a recent campaign to raise money from private dona-<br /><br />\ntions, Hopkins raised over $500 million in the course of<br />\n5 years (8 percent went to Arts and Sciences).<br />\nSince the day Hopkins' doors opened in 1876, it has been<br />\nan institution geared towards research and graduate study.<br />\nHopkins was not intended as a springboard from which<br />\nadolescents could make their respective leaps into the<br />\nworld. The international pre-eminence of our medical insititutions and The Hubble Space Telescope Institute here<br />\nat Homewood are just two testaments to Hopkins' commitment to its research creed. Miracles happen every day<br />\nat Johns Hopkins Hospital, testament, too to the fruits of<br />\nthat commitment. Yet the doctors, researchers, and scientists who work these wonders weren't born with minds<br />\nsteeped in organic chemistry\u2014or with a pleasant bedside<br />\nmanner. The importance of an undergraduate education<br />\ncannot be overstated when social and academic development are at stake.<br />\nYet the University continues to play with fire. A pattern in the Arts and Sciences\u2014tuition and class size increases paired with reductions in faculty and programs\u2014<br />\ncan only hurt the students and ultimately Johns Hopkins<br />\nitself. While we haven't sunk so far that swift recovery<br />\nis impossible, now is the time to arrest any overall trends<br />\ntoward mediocrity\u2014before Johns Hopkins' Arts and<br />\nSciences, its student body, and its future as an elite center<br />\nof learning are jeopardized.<br /><br />\nThe New<br />\nNews-Letter<br /><br />\nAs we move into our 92nd year, the editorial board of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins News-Letter has made a number of<br />\nchanges which we hope will help us to better serve the<br />\nHopkins community, as well as provide us with more room<br />\nto grow and prepare for the coming years.<br />\nProbably our most noticeable transformation is the<br />\nswitch from a tabloid to a full-size newspaper.

Like last<br />\nyear, I am camped in a remote<br />\narea where I am removed from<br />\nfireworks, cheesy small town<br />\nparades, and the excess of narrow<br />\nminded \"America is the best and<br />\ndon't you forget it\" hoopla. I<br />\nprefer isolation for this particular<br />\nholiday. Here in Fisher Caldera<br />\non Unimak Island in the Aleutian<br />\nchain, it is about 48 degrees this<br />\nafternoon. This is combined with<br />\n20 mph wind and light rain; sort<br />\nof like living inside a cloud. Certainly less than ideal camping<br />\nconditions. This is the worst<br />\nweather John and I have seen in<br />\nour 11 days here. Amazing how<br />\nwhat was paradise 24 hours ago,<br />\nnow feels like prison. If today<br />\nwere nice weather, the plane<br />\nwould be able to get in here and<br />\npick us up. We could get out of<br />\nhere and back to the thriving<br />\nmetropolis of Dutch Harbor. I<br />\ncould really go for a good mea!<br />\nand a shower right now.<br />\nYesterday was indeed paradise.<br />\nI normally enjoy sunny days and<br />\nreally rainy days, but not overcast days. Yesterday was one of<br />\nthose in between days. I never<br />\nthought an overcast day could be<br />\nso beautiful. It was a pleasant<br />\n55-60 degrees with virtually no<br />\nwind. Looking out over the<br />\nlargest lake in the caldera and taking in the unspoiled landscape<br />\nwas almost like a religious experience. No, not almost...it was.<br />\nFunny-looking ground squirrels<br />\nmaking obscure chirping noises<br />\nfrom their holes in the tundra, a<br />\npair of ducks diving for food in<br />\nthe lake...but best of all was the<br />\nnatural landscape. A landscape of<br />\nmagical beauty. The steep, lightly<br />\nvegetated slopes forming the<br />\nnorth rim of the caldera reminded me of the Pali cliffs on the<br /><br />\nwindward side of the Oahu.<br />\nThat's it, the Aleutians are like<br />\nHawaii...only colder. There are<br />\nof course some differences in the<br />\nvegetation and animal life; green<br />\ntundra with no trees versus palm<br />\ntrees and rain forest vegetation;<br />\ncaribou and wolves versus<br />\ntropical birds, but the landscape<br />\nof volcanoes and black sand<br />\nbeaches is identical. Put a couple<br />\ndozen hotels filled with Japanese<br />\ntourists on the south side of<br />\nUnimak and you have Waikiki.<br />\nAh, there's the difference. The<br />\nAleutians, Unimak in particular,<br />\nare undeveloped. There are of<br />\ncourse some fishing ports like<br />\nDutch Harbor, but most of the<br />\nlandscape has not been scarred by<br />\ncivilization. The native Aleut<br />\npeople, much like American Indians, lived off the land and the<br />\nsea. Evidence of their former<br />\npresence on these islands is fairly scarce.<br />\nAfter camping in this peaceful<br />\nsetting, I'm afraid every future<br />\ncamping experience will seem inferior. There is simply zero<br />\nevidence of man's presence in<br />\nthis area. Walking miles of lake<br />\nshore and seeing not a single soda<br />\ncan, cigarette butt or tangled<br />\nfishing line is pretty cool. The only sign of any animal life are<br />\nground squirrel and bird nests and<br />\nthe trails worn in the tundra by<br />\nbears crossing through the<br />\ncaldera. Our footprints spoil<br />\nsome muddy areas, but after the<br />\nwinter there will be no trace of<br />\nour presence here. No one will<br />\nnotice the smashed rocks we are<br />\nleaving behind, so next summer<br />\nsomeone else could visit the<br />\ncaldera and see it in its pristine<br />\nstate.<br />\nAll this clean air really does<br />\nsomething to my brain. When out<br />\nin the wilderness, be it the Aleutians, New Mexico, Nevada, or<br />\nwherever, I always get very<br />\nanalytical. This trip I've been<br /><br />\nthinking mostly about politics,<br />\nbut maybe that's because we have<br />\na radio and lots has been going<br />\non lately (flag burning, restricting<br />\nabortion rights). My mind seems<br />\nto be more sharp and active than<br />\nwhen in Baltimore. But this could<br />\nbe due to the absence of beer out<br />\nhere rather than the excess of<br />\nclean air. After our second day<br />\nof work, John and I were seriously regretting our not bringing a<br />\ncouple cases along. It's not like<br />\nwe couldn't keep it cold. The<br />\nstream we are camped next to<br />\nchecks in at 34 degrees F. If we<br />\nget out tomorrow and I can get<br />\na beer at the Ballyhoo lounge (the<br />\nbar in the Dutch Harbor airport),<br />\nit will end my beerless spell at 14<br />\ndays. For some, this is a long<br />\ntime to go without a beer. At this<br />\npoint, the only forces drawing me<br />\nback to Baltimore are 1) The<br />\ndesire to see and talk to more than<br />\none person all day every day, and<br />\n2) The desire to spend time at<br />\nPJ's.<br />\nUnimak is still fresh in my<br />\nmind as I sit in this air conditioned room back at Hopkins. Things<br />\nhave changed very little over the<br />\nsummer,though they did raise the<br />\nprice for Sunday pizza at Pis.<br />\nI'm actually glad to be in<br />\nBaltimore, however I probably<br />\nwon't feel this way a month from<br />\nnow.

A parade of sordid New York .City imagery<br />\npasses before the camera: adult<br />\nmovie theaters, prostitutes haggling with clients. The audience<br />\nrecoils; it's as if they want to roll<br />\nup the car windows, lock the<br />\ndoors, and speed away.<br />\nThese beginning minutes are as<br />\npowerful and disturbing as<br />\nanything in \"Sea of Love,\"<br />\nwhich, perhaps, is not saying<br />\nmuch. Al Pacino is Homicide<br />\nDetective Frank Keller, a 20-year<br />\npolice veteran who drinks,<br />\n'brawls, and generally slmighs<br />\naround. His life doesn't seem to<br />\nhave much direction, perhaps<br />\nbecause his wife recently left him<br />\nfor another detective. And Keller,<br />\nnot surprisingly, has just been<br />\nassigned to a new case: A man<br />\nwas shot through the head, face<br />\ndown, lying on his bed while the<br />\n1959 ballad \"<br />\n.Sea of Love\"<br /><br />\nplayed endlessly on his turntable.<br />\nKeller has to find the murderer.<br />\nBut a second victim is soon<br />\ndiscovered, and Keller teams up<br />\nwith a fellow detective (John<br />\nGoodman). The two devise a plan<br />\nto trap the killer, who selects victims from the personal ads (and<br />\nwho also, apparently, has a flair<br />\nfor poetry). With the help of<br />\nKeller's father, the two detectives<br />\nwrite some verse of their own,<br />\nplace an ad, and wait for<br />\nresponses to pile up.<br />\nIt doesn't take long. As Keller<br />\n'interviews the respondents to the<br />\nad, who are all women, he has<br />\ntrouble separating his job as investigator from his urges as lonely guy. This is the conflict that<br />\nprovides the center for \"Sea of<br />\nLove,\" as Keller becomes sexually involved with Helen Cruger<br />\n(Ellen Barkin), who is, of course,<br />\nhis main suspect.<br />\nBarkin endows Cruger with a<br />\nsexuality that is strong but not<br />\noverbearing. She offsets moments<br />\nof murky eroticisfb with an occasional childlike grin; it leaves us<br /><br />\nguessing. And though we want<br />\nproof of Cruger's psychopathic<br />\nand sexually deviant side (we<br />\nhear about it often), she teases<br />\nmore than she titillates.<br />\nIt eventually becomes obvious<br />\nthat Keller is to be Cruger's next<br />\nvictim. Meanwhile, the part of<br />\nthe movie we haven't figured<br />\nout\u2014their \"torrid\" love affair\u2014<br />\nhas lost our interest. Pacino and<br />\nBarkin look uncomfortable and<br />\ntentative: there's nothing definite<br />\nin their scenes together, and they<br />\ntend to lapse into idiocy when<br />\nthey talk to each other (\"I feel<br />\nlike a big cat in a small cage\" and<br />\n\"you know what you know and<br />\nyou go with ii.\") What starts as<br />\nmere awkwardness balloons into<br />\nimplausibility.<br />\nPacino hasn't aged well. \"Sea<br />\nof Love\" is his firs film since<br />\n1985's \"Revolution\"(somewhat<br />\nless succesful than the original,<br />\n200 years earlier) and there's a<br />\ngood deal missing in his performance. \"Sea of Love,\" like<br />\n\"Fatal Attraction\" or \"Jagged<br />\nEdge,\" requires that its actors<br /><br />\n467-7188<br /><br />\n27th St. &amp; Howard<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nMon Nile<br />\nFootball on<br />\nTwo 40\" TVs<br />\nFree Pizza and<br />\nWings at Half<br />\nTime<br />\n.50 Draft<br />\n$2.00 Meatball Sub<br /><br />\nTues Nite<br /><br />\nWed Nite<br /><br />\nPersonal Pizza<br />\n$1.95<br />\n1 Free Topping<br />\nCharl-Broiled<br />\nHamburger Build<br />\nYour Own Burger<br />\nWith Free<br />\nToppings....<br />\n$3.95<br /><br />\n.50 Pizza Slice<br />\n.75 Mug Nite<br />\n\"Buck a Bud\"<br /><br />\nThurs Nite<br />\nCollege Nite<br />\nSpecials on Pitchers, Drafts,<br />\nShooters...<br />\n16\" Pizza With<br />\nCheese... $5.00<br />\nPopular D.J.<br />\n9-10 All the Draft<br />\nyou Can Drink<br />\n$1.00<br /><br />\nFri Nite<br /><br />\nSat Nite<br /><br />\nSun Day<br /><br />\nSpaghetti and Meat<br />\nBall<br />\nGarlic Bread....<br />\n$4.95<br />\nSalad<br />\nCrab Special..$9.95<br />\nAll You Can EatBowl of Crab Soup<br />\nand Corn....7 P.M.<br /><br />\nOpen at Noon...<br />\nCollege Football on<br />\nBoth T.V.'s....<br />\nSub Specials All<br />\nDay<br />\nCrab ,Special..$9.95<br />\nAll you Can Eat<br />\nBowl of Crab Soup<br />\nand Corn...7 P.M.<br />\ntill...<br />\nPurchase any 16\"<br />\nPizza..get Pitcher<br />\nfor 1 cent (Beer or<br />\nCoke)<br /><br />\nComplete<br />\nBreakfast... $1.99<br />\nSunday Brunch...<br />\n11 till 2<br />\nN.F.L Football on<br />\nBoth T.V.'s<br />\nPizza Slices...$.50<br />\nTaco....$.50<br />\nDraft...$.50<br />\nHot Turkey or Ho<br />\nBeef with French<br />\nFries and Cole<br />\nSlaw...$4.95<br />\nStudent Special<br />\nDinners....
