The<br />\nstation's signal has been received<br />\nup to 40 miles away during<br />\ntesting and reportedly has the<br />\nbest fidelity of any Baltimore<br />\nradio station.<br />\nOne hundred fifty volunteers currently constitute the<br />\nstation staff, including 50 D.J.s<br />\nand 30 news staffers. The station<br />\nmanager for the next 12 months<br />\nis Jud French, who occupied<br />\nthat post last year. The assistant<br />\nstation manager is Greg Cherim,<br />\nnewly electe to that position.<br />\nRounding out the station management are Bob Spires, chief<br />\nengineer, Tony Dahbura, program director, and Audrey Zettick, business manager.<br />\nThe station was formerly a<br />\nStudent Activities Commission<br />\ngroup but FCC rules mandated<br />\ndirect control on the part of the<br />\nGoverning Board.<br />\n<br />\nincreased tremendously,\" the<br />\nhealth department stated. \"This<br />\nsegment of the population has<br />\nreached adolescence without the<br />\nfull benefit of rubella innoculation and without the usual<br />\nopportunity of exposure to<br />\nrubella as a young person.<br />\nSeventy per cent of the 1977<br />\nrubella cases occurred in this<br />\ngroup.\"<br />\nThe immunization program<br />\nnext week will be conducted<br />\nusing the Infirmary facilities<br />\nby personnel from the state<br />\nhealth department.<br />\nReiner<br />\nurged all students, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate, faculty members<br />\nand staff, including employees,<br />\nto be innoculated.<br />\nShe said people who have<br />\nalready had the disease or have<br />\nalready been vaccinated need<br />\nnot take part, but noted that the<br />\nstate health department considers a serum blood test necessary to establish a person's<br />\nimmunity. She said such tests<br />\nwill be offered Monday and<br />\nTuesday in addition to the<br />\ninnoculations.<br />\nThe vaccine itself will be a<br />\ncombination<br />\nrubella-measles<br />\nimmunization, Reiner said. According to the health department, \"in about 90% of people,<br />\none shot will give protection,<br />\nprobably for life.\" Reiner added<br />\nthat while children sometimes<br />\nneed to be re-immunized, college-age students will never need<br />\nto worry about the disease<br />\nagain.<br />\nThe chief potential side<br />\neffect of the vaccine in adults is<br />\n\"aching or swelling of the<br />\njoints\" according to the health<br />\ndepartment literature. As many<br />\nas one in four adults may<br />\nexperience these problems within two to 10 weeks of receiving<br />\nthe inoculation.<br />\nHowever, Reiner noted that<br />\nthe first doses administered at<br />\nHopkins produced no such ill<br />\neffects. \"We already vaccinated<br />\nthe entire lacrosse team--one<br />\nplayer had a suspected case--and<br />\nthe team still won their game the<br />\nnext day, so they're a good<br />\nmodel,\" she said.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4 1 APRIL 6, 1979<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews Letter<br />\nThe News-Letter is published weekly during the school<br />\nyear by the students of the Johns Hopkins University.

Ono<br />\n<br />\nNuke Necessity letters to the<br />\neditor'<br />\n<br />\nLast week's mishap in the nuclear generating plant at<br />\nThree Mile Island, Pennsylvania, has suddenly raised<br />\nserious questions regarding the role which nuclear power<br />\nwill play in this country's future.<br />\nUnfortunately, the reactions of most Americans, even<br />\nthose who call themselves educated, has been to fly into a<br />\nblind, unthinking panic. Witness for example this statement made by Biophysics professor Richard Cone: \"I<br />\nwonder why it is that our political leadership, economic<br />\nleaders, and business leaders are all in concert saying that<br />\nwe need to produce energy at an ever-increasing rate.\"<br />\nThe reason is all too obvious. There is a direct correlation between horsepower applied per manhour of labor<br />\nand gross national product per capita for every nation in<br />\nthe world. And horsepower applied translates directly into<br />\nenergy.<br />\nLook at it another way. The world's population has<br />\ndoubled within the last 50 years. Think about that for a<br />\nsecond--it's staggering. The only way 3 billion people can<br />\nbe fed, much less clothed, housed, or given what we like to<br />\ncall in the U.S. a \"minimum\" standard of living, is through<br />\nthe application of energy.<br />\nThe energy sources which have sustained us over the<br />\npast two centuries since the Industrial Revolution are<br />\nlimited. Fossil fuels will run out. So far, nuclear power<br />\nis the most reliable means devised to replace them. It too is<br />\nultimately limited, but it is essential that it be exploited as<br />\nmuch as possible in the meantime. To turn our backs on<br />\nthe situation and deny the necessity of obtaining new<br />\nenergy supplies is to call forth disaster, a holocaust the<br />\nproportions of which we can scarcely conceive.<br />\nFurther, it has not been demonstrated that nuclear<br />\npower poses excessively serious public health hazards,<br />\nsensational motion pictures to the contrary notwithstanding. For all the intense publicity it received, not one<br />\nfatality resulted from the Three Mile Island accident,<br />\nnor was significant environmental damage caused. And-a<br />\nrecent computer study based on the Three Mile Island<br />\naccident predicted that even a worst-case meltdown would<br />\nhave been non-lethal.<br />\nAdmittedly, the continued use of nuclear power<br />\ngenerators does involve some safety_ risks. But many<br />\ndecisions we make every day, such as the decision to drive<br />\nan automobile on a public thoroughfare,involve such risks.<br />\nThe price for giving up nuclear power is just way too much<br />\nto pay.<br />\n<br />\nWelcome, WellERJ<br />\nThis week witnessed the first broadcasts of a fledgling<br />\nvoice at Johns Hopkins, WJHU-FM. The station has<br />\ntremendous potential to become an important part of the<br />\nmedia not only on the Hopkins campus but in the whole<br />\ncity. Station personnel, including especially Jud French,<br />\nhave done a great job of upgrading the facilities to achieve<br />\none of the best FM signals anywhere.<br />\nIf there is one area where the station's format must be<br />\nquestioned, it is the \"block programnyine concept it is<br />\nfollowing. With classical music during the day, jazz in the<br />\nmorning, and rock in the evenings, the station has no<br />\nconsistent personality which would enable it to develop a<br />\nconsistent listenership. But it will take several months<br />\nbefore the station's preference can be effectively evaluated.<br />\nIn any ease, we wish our baby media brother the best<br />\nof luck as it takes the air. If they find things a bit aggravating from time to time, they' will easily be able to understand how we must feel after 83 years.<br />\n<br />\nBye-Bye<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOver the past few years, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins News-Letter has<br />\nbeen a paradigm of irresponsible<br />\nand sophomoric journalism. Nevertheless, I consented to write<br />\nfor your publication feeling that<br />\nI could make some sort of<br />\npositive contribution towards<br />\nthe quality of the paper and my<br />\nown career. I even suffered<br />\nhaving my name printed on your<br />\neditorial page as a \"staff writer.\"<br />\nIn light of many abhorrent deeds<br />\nof yours which have recently<br />\ncome to my attention, in addition to various slanders, untruths, and injustices, which I<br />\nhave been forced to endure,<br />\nit is now my opinion that I have<br />\nmade a mistake.<br />\nI am unwilling and unable<br />\nto be a part of an organization<br />\nthat can blithely misquote people, distort facts, and fabricate<br />\nlies without the slightest regard<br />\nfor the grief and damage it<br />\ncauses. I refer here, to name a<br />\nfew, to the injustices recently<br />\nsuffered by WJHU and Jeff<br />\nMarks. I also refer to the outrageous and fantastic fabrications<br />\nwhich have appeared about me<br />\nin your last two (March 16<br />\nand 9)issues.<br />\nI an unwilling and unable to<br />\nbe associated with a publication<br />\nthat is incapable of accepting<br />\nblame or admitting a mistake, no<br />\nmatter how culpable the misdeed or damaging the mistake.<br />\nI am unwilling and unable<br />\nto sanction an organization<br />\nwhich routinely and recklessly<br />\nbreaks promises and ignores<br />\npreviously made commitments.<br />\nYou will please remove my<br />\nname from your membezship<br />\nlists, editorial headers, and any<br />\nother written materials and<br />\ncorrespondence, present and<br />\nfuture.<br />\n<br />\nlater we cannot share the same<br />\nkind of enthusiasm for the<br />\npre-medical program at Hopkins.<br />\nMany would assume that<br />\nthe quality of the program<br />\nwould be reflected in the rate of<br />\nacceptances to medical school.<br />\nOn the surface the evidence<br />\nseems very complimentary. Nationally, approximately one<br />\nthird of those who apply to<br />\nmedical school are accepted.<br />\nLast year, between sixty and<br />\nseventy per cent of those who<br />\napplied from Hopkins were<br />\naccepted into at least one<br />\nmedical school. This is a quite<br />\nimpressive statistic. However, an<br />\nextremely important fact has<br />\nbeen omitted. This academic<br />\nyear, the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool has accepted only three<br />\nstudents from our undergraduate<br />\nprogram. It appears that the<br />\nMedical Institution shows little<br />\nregard for its own undergrads.<br />\nThis raises several questions.<br />\nHow can other medical schools<br />\nthink highly of our pre-medical<br />\nprogram when our medical<br />\nschool, most familiar with the<br />\ncurriculum, does nothing to<br />\npromote us? How long will the<br />\nreputation of this school maintain its present level? Lastly, if<br />\nHopkins does see flaws in our<br />\nprogram, what is being done to<br />\nrectify them?<br />\nIt is worthwhile to look at<br />\nother highly ranked medical<br />\nschools and their attitudes towards their undergrads. Cornell<br />\nMedical College grants every<br />\nCornell undergrad an interview.<br />\nThe University of Pennsylvania<br />\nMedical School fills approximately one quarter of its class with<br />\nPenn applicants. The figures for<br />\nHarvard are similar. Why is<br />\nHopkins ignoring its undergrads?<br />\nSomething must be done and the<br />\nfirst step should be an explanation from Dr. Muller and the<br />\nadmissions committee at the<br />\nMedical School.<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nGeorge Petrossian<br />\nChuck McGlade<br />\n<br />\nWith regret,<br />\n<br />\nPre-Meds Erroneous<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nUpon graduation from High<br />\nSchool both of us were fairly<br />\ncertain that we would choose<br />\nmedicine as our career. With this<br />\nin mind, we decided to attend<br />\nJohns Hopkins because of its<br />\nreputation of having one of the<br />\nfinest pre-medical programs in<br />\nthe country. When close to one<br />\nhalf of our freshman class chose<br />\nto follow a pre-med program it<br />\nwas obvious that we were not<br />\nalone. Unfortunately, four years<br />\n<br />\ning of March 6th at which<br />\nPeabody students performed was<br />\nscheduled in September, 1978-several months before the<br />\nGoucher concert was arranged.<br />\n3. The resultant conflict<br />\nwhich deprived students of \"the<br />\nrare educational opportunity to<br />\nhear their teachers perform\" was<br />\nin no way caused by the Conservatory's scheduling.<br />\n4. The Conservatory did<br />\nnot profit in any way from the<br />\nGoucher concert.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nIrving Lowens<br />\nDean,Peabody Institute<br />\n<br />\nContrived<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs an ex-Peabody student--a<br />\nmusician who has gone into<br />\nanother profession--I would like<br />\nto comment on the recent article<br />\nby Harry Lerner about the<br />\nConservatory students' dissatisfaction with the orchestral curriculum and its conductor, because the facts are debatable,<br />\nand the implications fallacious.<br />\nIf the curriculum of a<br />\nconservatory is to be a sophisti- _<br />\ncated one, it should not rely<br />\nupon box-office popularity, or<br />\non the war-horses of the past. It<br />\nseems that Dr. Galkin is trying<br />\nto bring the Peabody curriculum<br />\ninto the 20th century. I wonder<br />\nwhat students in medicine or<br />\ndentistry, for example, would<br />\nthink if their curriculum did not<br />\nreflect the most contemporary<br />\ninformation about the field.<br />\nIt is naive to state that the<br />\neducation of Peabody students is<br />\nbeing \"eroded\" by the inclusion<br />\nof modern works and American<br />\nmusic. On the contrary; it can<br />\nonly be enhanced by them.<br />\nAnd, shouldn't the programs of the Conservatory set an<br />\nexample? If they are not more<br />\nadventurous than any others, at<br />\nthe vanguard of music, whose<br />\nwill be?<br />\nFinally, for a student to<br />\nstate that a conductor like<br />\nFrederik Prausnitz, who has an<br />\nextensive recording reputation,<br />\nwho has conducted throughout<br />\nEurope and the United States,<br />\nwhose BBC programs introduced<br />\nsome of the most difficult<br />\nnew music to the world, is<br />\n\"incompetent,\" is simply absurd. Just wait until that student<br />\nand his friends get out into the<br />\nfield; they'll find out what<br />\nincompetence is.<br />\nThe whole article, and the<br />\nfacts upon which it was based,<br />\nseem superficial and contrived.<br />\n<br />\nThe letter to the editor<br />\nsigned Edward H.

If you can<br />\ntake the initiative and keep him<br />\nconfused and frightened, you<br />\nmay be able to discourage him.<br />\nTake advantage of a time<br />\nwhen he is close to you and bent<br />\nforward for some reason (say, to<br />\nblock a kick). Grab the hair on<br />\ntop of his head, and bring your<br />\nweight down on him, as if you<br />\nwere slamming a trunk. Double<br />\nhim up, and if you can, knee<br />\nhim in the face. Once you have<br />\nhim doubled up, keep him that<br />\nway.<br />\nOne of the hardest facts to<br />\naccept about rape is that no<br />\nmatter how well-protected or<br />\nprepared you are, it can happen<br />\nto you.

There<br />\nare possibilities for bringing the<br />\nmedia in or for people at the<br />\nschool to go out and talk on<br />\nissues more than they have been<br />\ndoing. There are opportunities<br />\nunparalleled anywhere in this<br />\nCongresscountry to bring<br />\nmen, senior Executive branch<br />\nofficials, foreign diplomats, and<br />\njournalists into the school to<br />\ninteract with students and faculty, which perhaps, could be<br />\nimproved.\"<br />\nPackard said that it was too<br />\nearly to propose any specific<br />\ninternal policy changes concerning such issues as the supposed<br />\nfactionalism among the junior<br />\nand senior faculty, enrollment,<br />\nand problems created by the<br />\nlarge percentage of part-time<br />\nfaculty employed by SAIS.<br />\nHe does favor the general<br />\nprinciple of a core international<br />\nrelations curriculum, which is<br />\nbeing discussed by a SAIS<br />\ncurriculum review committee.<br />\n\"There are certain parts of<br />\nInternational Relations which<br />\nshould be known by every SAIS<br />\ngraduate, that should define<br />\nwhat a SAIS graduate is,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nBefore he assumes his post,<br />\nDr. Packard plans to consult<br />\npeople both inside and outside<br />\nthe University in order to learn<br />\nwhat programs SAIS might wish<br />\nto adopt. With the aim of<br />\nassessing the strengths and<br />\nweaknesses of the major institutions similar to SAIS, Packard<br />\nplans to visit such schools as the<br />\nFletcher School of Law and<br />\nDiplomacy, where he received<br />\nhis Ph.d. He will meet with its<br />\ndeal, a friend of his at Princeton, and Edmund Gulion, the<br />\nformer Dean.

In his capacity as<br />\nDeputy Director of the Wilson<br />\nCenter, he conceived of and has<br />\nbeen working with a planning<br />\ncommittee that has so far<br />\nraised a budget of $700,000 to<br />\n$800,000 per year, he raised<br />\nmoney for his 1976 Senate race,<br />\nand he has worked with several<br />\nfoundations and private schools<br />\non fundraising. He was cautiously optimistic about the future.<br />\n\"Fundraising is getting<br />\nrougher everywhere, particularly<br />\nin the foreign affairs field. I've<br />\nlearned here that the trend is<br />\naway from purely international<br />\ntype programs. If you look at<br />\nthe Ford Foundation, you'll<br />\nnotice that many of their<br />\nprograms are heading toward<br />\ndomestic problems. The new<br />\nhead of the Ford Foundation<br />\nseems to have his main interest<br />\nin domestic and urban problems.<br />\nSo it goes across the board.<br />\n<br />\n\"On the other hand, it is my<br />\nview that the United States has<br />\nnever been more dependent on<br />\nthe rest of the world for its<br />\neconomic well-being and its<br />\nsecurity than it is today. Therefore, I think a very strong case<br />\ncan be made for schools like<br />\nSAIS, and I intend to make that<br />\ncase. I think that the other<br />\nproblem, of course, is that<br />\nwhether it's domestic or foreign,<br />\nall sources of funding are being<br />\nbesieged with worthy applicants.<br />\nThere are more and more<br />\ngroups, there are interest groups,<br />\nthere are education groups, there<br />\nare lobbying and pressure<br />\ngroups. It's a time for a vast<br />\nattack on all problems of society, all of which are important<br />\nto solve, so SAIS must take its<br />\nplace as one claimant among<br />\nmany more institutions. Nevertheless, SAIS has a unique<br />\nquality. It is really the only<br />\n<br />\nschool quite like it in this particularly the ones in the<br />\narea, and there are only three or Washington area, I think that<br />\nfour or five which you can think huge rewards can be reaped<br />\nof in the whole country.

This \"Academic Curtain\" is most noticeable when a puff<br />\nof fresh air somehow manages to sneak through,<br />\nbringing with it a seldom-felt realization that<br />\nthere are indeed events and machinations<br />\noutside our tightly guarded perimeter which are<br />\nnot divided into semesters, credit hours or exam<br />\nperiods. This wind sends many darting to the<br />\nsafety of C-Level, where their sweaty palms<br />\nmay be dried on the pages of countless reassuringly silent tomes, but I, for one, always enjoy<br />\nthose rare Zephyrs for the sudden sense of<br />\nperspective they provide. It's for this reason<br />\nthat I always look forward to Spring Break as<br />\nwell--it's a chance to crash the gate and go<br />\nstrolling in the spring air--both physically and<br />\nfiguratively.

It's protected<br />\nfrom the roar and diesel fumes of Interstate 81<br />\nby a sleepy hamlet with the sleepy name of<br />\nChristiansburg--a town which sports a Baptist<br />\nchurch every three blocks and a wild night<br />\nmaybe once a year. I'm told that folks from<br />\nChristiansburg don't often find an excuse<br />\nto go the four miles down the pike to Tech,and<br />\nthat such an arrangement suits the inhabitants of<br />\nboth places just dandy, thank you. It appears<br />\nthe good Citizens are skeptical of the Techies'<br />\nmoral fiber. You see, the students, by-in-large,<br />\nare not natives of the area, but rather hail from<br />\nNorthern Virginia, Southern Maryland, and<br />\nother localities too close to Babylon-on-the-Potomac and the gilded throne of Big Brother<br />\nfor comfort.

Wrapping around on three<br />\nsides, like protoplasm to a nucleus, is Blacksburg, Va.--an oasis of popular culture in the<br />\n<br />\nbleakest of the boonies. Finally, stretching over<br />\nthe valley floor toward a hazy range of hills, is<br />\nthe vast agricultural complex with its solar<br />\ncollectors and sleek windmills which beat the air<br />\nsilently in a lazy rhythm.

Which brings us to the second big<br />\ndifference--it's a damn sight prettier than uptown Mobtown.<br />\nThe most 'noticeable edifice by far on the<br />\ncampus is mammoth Lane Stadium,60,000 seats<br />\nand still growing.

The press--box is three stories tall, air-conditioned, and in<br />\nconstant contact with the major capitols of the<br />\nworld. Dixie Dick was much affected.<br />\nThe name of Virginia Tech's team is the<br />\n\"Hokies.\" A hokie is--I kid you not--a castrated<br />\nturkey. You can imagine how- many times<br />\nduring the course of my brief stay the opportunity arose for a truly top-notch joke or comment<br />\nconcerning that ridiculous name, and I can't<br />\nremember how many times I bit my tongue and<br />\nheld my piece in order to avoid winding up<br />\nmuch like that unfortunate bird at the hands of<br />\nsome barrel-chested Techie. Actually, I can see a<br />\nglimmer of sense to the whole thing, for there<br />\nmust be great incentive forathletes not to screw<br />\nup when they know their team is named after<br />\nsome scrotumless fowl. With a name like that<br />\n<br />\nnot on particularly bad terms with their residential neighbors. Is this due, perhaps, to the<br />\nfact that Hokies don't .party as hard as our<br />\nGreek-letter laureates? I hardly think so, for one<br />\nnight Dixie Dick and I stumbled onto a frat<br />\nparty that was making enough noise to raise<br />\nRick Pfeffer's tenure chances, though we received repeated assurances that not half the<br />\nmembers had as yet returned from Spring<br />\nvacation. On the order of every twenty seconds<br />\nor so, a crouching figure would darken the<br />\nsecond-story ledge, swallow a shot-glass of liquid<br />\ncourage, and launch itself bravely into sublunar<br />\nspace, all the while emitting a piercing screech<br />\nknown in the vicinity as the Hokie Howl.<br />\n(Allegedly, the very noise an actual turkey<br />\nmakes in the short but painful process of becoming a Hokie). Determined to find out how the<br />\nbrothers got away with such obvious hooliganism, I marched over to a pair of twins, who<br />\nturned out after all to be only one person, and<br />\nasked him how he got the neighbors to put up<br />\nwith it.<br />\n\"Well,\" he reflected, \"they're not a bad<br />\nbunch, really. You just have to know how to<br />\nhandle 'em the right way. Like Mr. Fogbottorn,<br />\nnext door, he's a real ornery coot.\"<br />\nI looked across the hedge and beheld a<br />\ndarkened home that seemed to slumber peace-<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nSpring Break: Hopkins lies brooding under another Baltimore mist...<br />\nthey're playing catch-up before they ever take<br />\nthe field.<br />\nIt's no exaggeration to say that Baltimore is<br />\nindifferent to Hopkins. We are reminded daily,<br />\nespecially by those vociferous, letter-writing<br />\nHoppies who have matriculated and then settled<br />\ndown locally, that we are guests here who at<br />\nbest are to be grudgingly tolerated until such<br />\ntime as we can graduate and move back where<br />\nwe came from with all deliberate speed. Why<br />\nthese people see the need to turn on their<br />\nalma-mater with such vehemence is doubtless<br />\ndue to either insecurity at their first step in the<br />\nabove-mentioned \"Real World,\" or a generous<br />\nserving of sour grapes--but whatever the childish<br />\nphenomenon's cause, it does not exist at Tech.<br />\nBlacksburg and the Campus are, for the most<br />\npart, partners and not adversaries:. the plastic<br />\nseats at McDonalds are a Hokie maroon and<br />\norange; the lights at Burger King are tiny replicas<br />\nof Tech football helmets; and Wendy's offers<br />\nfree soft drinks during Homecoming. Tacky, but<br />\ntouching. Blacksburg is without a doubt a<br />\ncollege town, but it goes farther than local<br />\nmerchants knowing which side their bread is<br />\nbuttered on, for the whole atmosphere is more<br />\ncongenial whenever townie and student meet.<br />\nThe former actually seem glad to have a university in the vicinity, and are more amused than<br />\nscandalized over the occasional public excesses<br />\nof youth.<br />\nThere are over twenty fraternities at Tech,<br />\nbut unlike their Hopkins counterparts, they are<br />\n<br />\nfully in spite of the godawful racket. Indeed, not<br />\na light was burning from attic to cellar. \"Oh, I<br />\nsee. You have your parties while he's out.<br />\n\"You might say that,\" said my new friend, a<br />\nsmile of amusement spreading across his face:<br />\n\"As a matter of fact, here he comes nowFollowing the direction of his raised arm, I<br />\nsaw a visibly older figure weaving about on the<br />\nlanding, a half-empty bottle of Southern<br />\nComfort waving banner-like in his hand.<br />\n\"Look out below, you punks!\" he screamed,<br />\nstepping proudly off the ledge. \"Aaaiiiieeeee!\"<br />\n\"You ought to see him in a lampshade,\" said<br />\nmy pal, turning into the house. \"It's a real<br />\nscream.\"<br />\nAll in all, an ingenious solution.<br />\nThe townies by no means have a monopoly<br />\non the area's good nature. The students too<br />\nseem much more easygoing and friendly than<br />\nthey do here. Actually, easygoing is too mild a<br />\nword-there is a languor pervading the place<br />\nwhich made me feel like I was speeding all week<br />\nby comparison. They linger over coffee, pause<br />\nover pastry, and positively vegetate over burgers<br />\n'n beer. They think nothing of stopping half a<br />\ndozen times between the door and men's room<br />\nto talk with friends, casual acquaintances,<br />\nperfect strangers, and various janitorial personnel. Come to think of it, people just talked one<br />\nhell of a lot down there (by in large, people \"P<br />\nhere don't talk--they discuss).<br />\n. ld he<br />\nThe resurgence of this genteel art cou<br />\ndue in large measure to the fact that there iS<br />\n<br />\n\fresiD the<br />\n<br />\n5 our<br />\n<br />\nr one<br />\nfrat<br />\nraise<br />\n-e reI the<br />\npring<br />\nonds<br />\nPi the<br />\niquid<br />\nlunar<br />\nreech<br />\n-low!.<br />\nirkey<br />\n,comthe<br />\nliganwho<br />\n, and<br />\nIt up<br />\n<br />\nbad<br />\nw to<br />\ntom,<br />\nld a<br />\neace-<br />\n<br />\nlittle else to do in Blacksburg once the Alcoholic<br />\nBeverage Control store shuts down at sunset. No<br />\ntheatres, no museums, one moviehouse, and<br />\nintermittent T.V. call for desperate measures-like conversation. Considering our clientele,<br />\nHopkins was just built in the wrong place...distractionless Blacksburg is the nerd's paradise.<br />\n\"When we were your age, Roscoe, we didn't<br />\nhave a lot of fancy diversions...we had to make<br />\nour own fun.\" I always thought it was just another parental saying handed down from time<br />\nimmemorial, but the Hokies I met do just that,<br />\nand their production exceeds our paltry quotas<br />\nby a humiliating margin. They were continually<br />\npuzzled by my ceaseless urgings that we go<br />\nsomewhere and do something, and the visit was<br />\nnearly over before I realized that a little relaxation on my part would make such exertions<br />\nwholly unnecessary. Dixie Dick was quick to<br />\nassure me that such a tension-free atmosphere<br />\nwas due soley to the fact that we were now<br />\ndeep in the sunshine of \"God's Country,\" and<br />\nsafe from the fetters of Megalopolis, but I can't<br />\nhelp thinking that it was more than just a<br />\nquestion of geography.<br />\nOf course the Hokies do have some diversions that are denied to we quasi-Yankees. A few<br />\nminutes from campus, for instance, is the<br />\nCascade--a many-leveled waterfall which ends<br />\n<br />\nby party directives or papal bulls. They seem to<br />\nhave an art,(for an art it must be)for transforming extra pounds into extra charms. Don't<br />\nget me wrong, there are no more chubby women<br />\nper capita at Tech than anywhere else, but<br />\nthose who happen to be so are not autmatically<br />\ndumped into the sexual cut-out rack. I still don't<br />\nknow how they do it, (oh, subtle art!) but a<br />\nwoman who would be \"a real porker\" up here<br />\ncan only be described down there as \"having<br />\nclassical features.\"<br />\nWhen asked to sum up the Hokie Honeys,<br />\nDixie Dick, with his usual flair, stated: \"They're<br />\nprettier than Hopkins women, poorer than<br />\nGoucherettes, and friendlier than Damies.\" Well<br />\nsaid!<br />\nFriendlier they are indeed, and I don't mean<br />\nthat in a locker room, elbow-jabbing way either.<br />\nI mean they will actually talk to you without<br />\nnervously fingering their mace canisters. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, contact between the sexes seems<br />\nto proceed in an entirely different manner than<br />\nit does (or, more often, does not) at The John.<br />\nTech has no on-campus swillery (thank God)--collegiate meeting places, like all essential<br />\nservices, being provided by Blacksburg. At the<br />\ntown's half-dozen favorite rendevous, ranging<br />\nfrom Disco to coffee-house, you will not see the<br />\nfrustrating ritual which is performed nightly at<br />\nthe Rat. The various tables are not segregated by<br />\nsex, with lonely headhunters walking aimlessly<br />\nabout the aisles in search of a fortunate collision.

No. Why bother when<br />\nyou can walk across it.<br />\nAnd now, let us turn to the women. Where<br />\nshould I begin? I suppose there is something to<br />\nbe said for the neo-fascist look which is currently the vogue in female fashion hereabouts. The<br />\nleather boots, rolled-up jeans, three-pound belt<br />\nbuckles, brass-studded blouses, and optional<br />\nriding crop that of late adorn our Towson<br />\ntootsies could conceivably cause a general<br />\ntumescence, provided of course that Hopkins<br />\nexclusively admitted S&M bondage freaks or did<br />\nits recruiting only at White Power rallies. As for<br />\nthis reporter, the history textbooks are as close<br />\nas he cares to get to the Third Reich, and the<br />\nnightly display of blitzkrefig beauties is a bit<br />\nmore depressing than uplifting. On top of this,<br />\nsuch master-sex regalia depends upon the wearer<br />\npossessing immaculate, emaciated measurements<br />\n(a rare occurrence)--even the barest hint of a<br />\nmidriff bulge makes the costume laughable as<br />\nwell as frightening.<br />\nNot so with the beauties of Virginia's gentler<br />\n'clime. Their clothing is eclectic, unconstrained<br />\n<br />\nmaking it impossible to separate the friends<br />\nfrom the lovers. The expressions and antics of<br />\nthe assembled Hokies, however, made the Rat's<br />\nDisco Night look like a wake. There was no<br />\ntension, no \"dance 'n chance\" line ringing the<br />\ndisco floor, no disappointed drunks under the<br />\ntables. I guess what's so alien about the whole<br />\naffair is that the sexes at Tech seem much more<br />\nwilling to be friends. They don't seem to have<br />\nheard that males and females must necessarily be<br />\nsoldiers in separate, armed camps. Feature that.<br />\nBut then again, they can't be expected...after all.<br />\nwe're so advanced here at Hopkins.<br />\nI'm aware that this article is beginning to<br />\nsound like a press release from the Blacksburg<br />\nChamber of Commerce, so it's high time to<br />\nthrow all due light on the drawbacks of Hokieland. One which comes immediately to mind is<br />\nthe profusion of curfew regulations. it is hard,<br />\nwith memories of wide-open freshman dorms<br />\nstill vivid, to imagine other people's living<br />\nquarters being off-limits--especially to souls of<br />\nhigh moral character like Dixie Dick and myself.<br />\nSuch, however, is the sad case. Every dorm<br />\nseems to have its own peculiar set of restrictions,<br />\nbut in general, all males have to clear out of the<br />\nfemale dorms by the stroke of midnight. Failure<br />\nto comply results in a dreaded \"pink slip,\" two<br />\nresult in suspension, and three result in the<br />\nforfeiture of your first born. This is all medieval<br />\nenough,to be sure, but the worst is yet to come:<br />\nall females must be out of the male dorms by no<br />\nlater than two o'clock! How this holdover of<br />\n<br />\nante-helium barbarity has survived the sexual<br />\nrevolution, I am not prepared to guess, but I<br />\nassure you, the hardiest of Hokies get sweaty in<br />\nmixed company when the witching hour draws<br />\nnear. Imagine actually having to order a voluptuous female out of your room! What unthinkable perversity! But there is something eve<br />\nmore macabre, for on the top five floors of one<br />\ninfamous residence hall, no male is allowed at<br />\nany time for any reason. At Goucher, at least,<br />\nthey consider an escort to be a sufficient guardian of the general piece...1 mean peace. But<br />\nimagine, if you will, entire floors where the<br />\ntread of males is ne'er heard! And they call<br />\nthemselves a university! Still, rules are made to<br />\nbe broken, and that sucker is just asking for it--I<br />\nimagine it's a natural for Hell Week pledge<br />\nstunts.<br />\nThe other disappointment, as you might<br />\nimagine, is the quality of the academics. It'<br />\nrather difficult to refrain from a little intellectual snobbery, while visiting down there, but I<br />\nthink Dixie and I kept our noses out of the air<br />\nmost of the time. A short walk around the<br />\nbookstore or a longer chat with some of the<br />\nstudents makes it painfully clear that Tech is<br />\nnot in the same league with our expensive and<br />\nprestigious institution. Of course, you have to<br />\nrealize that Tech serves a different purpose<br />\naltogether from Hopkins,training people for the<br />\nno-nonsense world of business, insurance and<br />\nengineering. I've been told, and I have no doubt,<br />\nthat Virginia Tech turns out excellent accountants, businessmen, contractors, and the like-but<br />\nI doubt if they produce too many truly educa,<br />\n-ted people. Like I said, though, snobbery<br />\ndoesn't pay, because those same Hokies will<br />\nprobably have nice, steady jobs by the time I try<br />\nto hock my English diploma for one last, hot<br />\nmeal.<br />\nYou see,I was counting on academics to pull<br />\nme through-to enable me to look back at<br />\nsombre, sobe'r Hopkins. and sigh, \"Well, that':<br />\nthe price you have to pay for an education.'<br />\nUnfortunately, it hasn't proved enough, and my<br />\nstoicism has derailed. I like the way Hokies do<br />\nthings, and I don't see why we can't follow suit.<br />\nIt's funny...in the past, I'd always been skeptical<br />\nof those who said they were \"fed up\" with<br />\nHopkins' social life. I figured it was just an<br />\nexcuse for not being able to cope with the<br />\nacademics. After all, wasn't collegiate social life<br />\nthe same, hard grind everywhere? I thought<br />\nso-but now I've seen the other side of the<br />\nmountain--the streets, unlike ours, aren't paved<br />\nwith greeenbacks and prestige, but the natives<br />\nover there seem a damn sight happier all the<br />\n<br />\nsame.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 I APRIL 6, 1979<br />\n<br />\nOur Man In Bologna<br />\n<br />\nPiazza<br />\nPeyton<br />\nBY TOM SCHILLER<br />\nWell, since it is Friday night and it is pouring<br />\npitchforks outside, I guess that I can write an article for'<br />\nthe good ole Hopkins News-Letter)! hope that this one<br />\nwill at least be grammatically correct.<br />\nIt is semester.break now, and .some of the richer,<br />\ncareer conscious, adventurous, patriotic, or possibly<br />\nstupid students have gone off to Brussels on a mostexpenses paid trip that will probably consist of lectures<br />\non: \"Despite its problems the United States is still the<br />\ncenter of the universe. \"and :\" If the Russkies piss on<br />\nthe wrong side of the German border we will race over<br />\nthere and blow'em back to Siberia before they can zip<br />\ngoing up there<br />\nup their flys. I see no sense in<br />\nwhen I can stay in Bologna, doing things like: watering<br />\nplants, not spending money, teaching, and most importantly, making up an incomplete. Besides, Pink Floyd is<br />\non the radio.<br />\nToday there was a student demonstration: a monthly occurence here, and I was determined not to miss it. I<br />\nhad missed some of the earlier ones; which was too bad<br />\nbecause they had been rather lively (cars burned, cops<br />\ntear-gassing each other, and the sight of our director<br />\nwalking into a huge gas cloud and slowly disappearing.)<br />\nI selected a discreet but well located cafe, bought a<br />\nnewspaper and au expresso; and sat, looking out into<br />\ngloomy, rain soaked square with less than a hundred<br />\nvery wet and bedraggled demonstratos huddling under<br />\nthe surrounding porticos. After about forty-five minutes,<br />\nthere was a sudden stirring among them. I put down<br />\nthe crossword puzzle and went outside. Some of them<br />\nhad lined up behind a banner. I also noticed a great<br />\nmany carabinieri, some in full riot costume with truncheons and gas grenades, others in their picturesque<br />\nuniforms holding carbines and automatic rifles. The<br />\ndemonstrators shouted some slogans and the carabinieri<br />\nrustled ominously. I found that my hands, feet and<br />\nstomach were tingling, and it suddenly dawned on me<br />\nthat I was scared shitless. After all, before coming here,<br />\nthe most armed men I had ever seen at one time were<br />\nmarching down Fifth Avenue on Veterans day, 1964.<br />\nAnyway, the students marched off down a side street,<br />\nescorted by the carabinieri, who outnumbered them by<br />\nabout two to one. That was it. Although the journalist<br />\ninside me bemoaned the lack of violence, the chicken<br />\nwithin was quite relieved.<br />\nNow for some semi-facetious information. The<br />\nSAIS Bolgna center contains a small group of strangers,<br />\nall lumped together in a strange land. At best, a reasonably convivial bunch of people, at worst, a collection of<br />\ngossip mongering, cliquey, cutthroats. All this is exacerbated by the fact that there are only 110 of them. Be<br />\ncareful. The person sitting next to you could be sticking<br />\nthe dagger of innuendo in your back. Actually, it is<br />\nquite humorous when one considers the possibilities for<br />\na TV sitcom (Piazza Peyton?) and besides, it's fun to<br />\nstart scandalous rumours about people, and to hear<br />\nequally scandalous ones about yourself. The group is also<br />\npretty straight. Some of the second year European<br />\nstudents bemoan this.<br />\nThe classes are not small, except when it's an<br />\nadvanced seminar, or when the professor is awful(of<br />\ncourse, if the professor has a good rep, his classes are<br />\njammed.) The professors themselves vary. The center<br />\nseems to be a farm team for budding young SAIS<br />\nhotshots (Don't worry, kid, get a few years of experience under your belt, write a few things, and we'll call<br />\nyou up to the big time.), and a grab bag of European<br />\nprofessors with varying degrees of eminence, ability, and<br />\ncomprehension of English. The upshot? You can select<br />\na good group of courses with stimulating professors or<br />\nyou can end up with some real dogs. Most end up halt<br />\nand half.<br />\nI have no complaints about the Bologna center<br />\nadministration, but then, my philosophy is: The less<br />\none deals with an administrator, the better for both<br />\nparties. The director said the same thing in his opening<br />\naddress. And from what I have heard about last year's<br />\ngroup (The students, enlightened by some professors as<br />\nto some inequities existing at the center, made things a<br />\nbit hot. . .) he must be reasonably pleased by the quiesence which currently prevails. This change means one of<br />\ntwo things: either the center has improved, or we're<br />\ndon't<br />\nand<br />\nshafted<br />\ngetting<br />\n<br />\nrealize it. I don't know and frankly don't care. I'm<br />\nonly,here as an undergrad, not for a degree.<br />\nThe social scene at the center revolves around Ivo's<br />\nsnack bar; \"handily situated in the Hopkins center, a<br />\nplace where the elite meet to eat, drink and be merry.\"<br />\nIvo whips up and serves burgers, sandwiches, and hot<br />\ndogs (my faves)with a certain flair and occasional<br />\n3urliness. He also brews a mean,sometimes vitriolic cup<br />\n)f caffe that has No-Doze beat.Three little cups and yer<br />\nshakin' all over.<br />\nThe clientele is distinctly mixed. At luchtime there<br />\nis a long line of Italian students who desire, and can pay<br />\nfor American cooking. The tables are filled with an<br />\nincredible selection of people. At one table one might<br />\nfind some American med students discussing exams,<br />\nintestines, and football; at another some Germanophones reading the Frankfurter Zeitung and ignoring<br />\neveryone else; some nerds divying up a heavy assignment; some patriots declaiming loudly on the slovenliness of the Italians, the instability of the lira, the latest<br />\nshooting, and possibly nuking Iran; a professor looking<br />\nvery lost; twits drinking coffee with their pinkies out;<br />\ncool dudes chatting about drugs, punk rock and the<br />\nfutility of it all; and some Italian girls out to meet some<br />\n\"nice American boys,\" chattering and giggling like crazy.<br />\n(One might say they are birdbrained, but not me;<br />\nI'm going to their parties.) Personally, I go from table to<br />\ntable, sitting wherever I'm tolerated, but lately, as hinted<br />\nabove, I've settled down at the lattermost table. Why?<br />\nWell, like any nice (?)

Madison<br />\nAve. is about the best you'll be able to find in Baltimore.<br />\nLocated only a few blocks north of Peabody, Uncle<br />\nCharlie's might be a good place to go if you're up for a<br />\nlittle disco after your meal, for it's just around the<br />\ncorner from the Casablanca. It is easily accessible by bus<br />\nfrom Hopkins;the no. 3 or no. 11 will let you off within<br />\na block.<br />\nSince reservations are not accepted, you can head<br />\nfor Uncle Charlie's whenever a spur of the moment<br />\nimpulse to drop $30 on a dinner for two hits you. If the<br />\nplace happens to be full when you get there, don't<br />\nbe surprised if you are shanghaied and politely pushed<br />\n<br />\nWide Ch\u201crhe<br />\n<br />\nUncle Charlie's Bistro is a favorite haunt<br />\nof Hoppies and other eating fans.<br />\nupstairs to a lounge area to wait. But don't resist too<br />\nhard, you might miss a worthwhile part of the \u2022charm<br />\nassociated with going to Uncle Charlie's. There, in the<br />\nupper portion of the Chambord which opens onto<br />\nCharles St. ,you and your companion can chat and sip<br />\n<br />\nyour drinks while relaxing on plush velvet sofas amidst<br />\nornate tables and gilded mirrors. The layout is spacious.<br />\nA whole floor of the building is divided into enough<br />\nsalon-style rooms that you can have one all to yourself if<br />\nthe place is not too crowded.<br />\nMoving downstairs to begin your meal is like emerging from the 1890's into the 1970's . The general tone is<br />\nmuch lighter, with simple wood tables adorned by the<br />\ncandle light from small kerosene lamps. Still, the<br />\nrestaurant exudes a romantic kind of class, with fresh<br />\nred carnations at every table. The whole restaurant has<br />\nonly about fifteen tables, er )ugh to prevent any isolation anxiety. But the din is not so overpowering that<br />\nit prevents a dinner conversation. Although most<br />\ncustomers wear a coat and tie, the general pattern of<br />\ndress is not overly formal.<br />\nIn most restaurants in France, la carte is invariably<br />\nposted in the front window. At Uncle Charlie's the<br />\nmenu is an integral part of the decor, handwritten on<br />\ntwo large wall panels. Small enough to fit this format,<br />\nthe menu does not offer a tremendous range of choices,<br />\nbut still enough variety to please almost any palate. The<br />\nlist of entrees is evenly divided into meat and fish dishes,<br />\nwith a few not so French offerings thrown in for seasoning. There is also a choice of two soups and three<br />\nsalads.<br />\nThe house salad would have been a perfect combination of crisp escarole lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and<br />\ncucumbers had it not been topped with a bland dressing.<br />\nThe onion soup was piping hot with lots of cheese,<br />\nwhich made it especially good.<br />\nThe pork entree, called Cote de porc madere, was<br />\nalso done well, although the taste of Madeira wine after<br />\nwhich the dish is named was difficult to detect. The two<br />\nrather thick chops, cooked crisp around the edges, were<br />\naccompanied by some rather tasteless rice. However, the<br />\ncauliflower which also came, with the meal was excellent, tender but not overcooked. A shad, broiled to<br />\nperfection, was delicious. The dinner was set off nicely<br />\nby fresh, crusty French rolls, served warm with creamy<br />\nsweet butter in little ceramic bowls, a la francaise.<br />\nAlthough the portions are generous, save room for<br />\nthe desserts-they are excellent.

The first<br />\nmeeting for those interested in working<br />\non Downtown will be held Monday at 10<br />\np.m. in the Listening Viewing Room.<br />\nDowntown is an adaptation of a<br />\nshort story of the same name by Stuart<br />\nCohen. In early March, Cohen read the<br />\nstory to friends, including Kurt Kimmel<br />\nand Susan Anderson, who agreed that he<br />\nshould rework the piece for the stage.<br />\nAfter further discussions with Edmund<br />\nWhite, Charles Newman and Dr. Jerome<br />\nMcGann, Cohen approached George<br />\nOwen, Dean of the Homewood Faculties,<br />\nwith his idea. Owen liked the story and<br />\nencouraged Cohen to seek funds frorri the<br />\nUniversity for the project. Cohen then<br />\npresented his proposal to Chris Colombo<br />\nand the Union Programming Board. Just<br />\nbefore spring break, the Board agreed to<br />\nprovide a $350.00 grant to help meet the<br />\nexpenses involved in Downtown's production. The Student Council is also<br />\ninvestigating the possibility of supporting<br />\nthe project.<br />\nA group of students, including<br />\nCohen, Anderson and Kimmel, had been<br />\nworking on the project while efforts were<br />\nunderway to raise m oney. When the<br />\nUnion Board announced the making<br />\nof the grant, the plans the group had were<br />\nput in motion.<br />\nThe successful organization of the<br />\nDowntown project can be attributed<br />\nlargely to Cohen's energy and initiative.<br />\n\"I think my great contribution was<br />\nappreciation,. \" said Owen. \"He had to<br />\ngo out and beat the bushes for support.\"<br />\nEdmund White was impressed by<br />\nCohen's willingness to go out on a limb.<br />\n\"He shows unusual desire to be innovative in taking a story and translating it<br />\ninto stage terms\"<br />\nCohen never intended Downtown to<br />\nbe a conventional play. \"Things will be<br />\nhappening all over the theater, not just on<br />\nthe stage. Instead of having people come<br />\nand fix their gazes on something \u2014 like a<br />\nt.v. set -- we're going to put the audience<br />\ninside the t.v.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe actors will have a great deal of<br />\nfreedom in interpreting their roles, Cohen<br />\nstressed. \"We will be open to suggestions,\" he said. \"The stylization of the<br />\nroles will allow a lot of room for individual interpretation.\"<br />\nWhat the group needs now is student<br />\nparticipation, according to Cohen. \"We<br />\nneed a lot of technical people for special<br />\neffects, as well as actors,\" he said. Special<br />\neffects include ultraviolet and neon lights,<br />\na traffic signal, a soundtrack made up of<br />\n<br />\nsnatches of music, conversation and<br />\nurban noise, , and various \"totems of<br />\ndowntown.\"<br />\nAn innovative advertising campaign is<br />\nalso being planned to drum up student<br />\ninterest in Downtown; people with<br />\ninterests in creative advertising are<br />\nencouraged to become involved.<br />\nDowntown is one of several projects<br />\norganized by students on their own<br />\nduring the past year.

Zeniada will go on sale<br />\nthe week of April 16.<br />\nThe Fine Arts Committee has also<br />\ntaken a daring new turn. Acting on the<br />\nassumption that their role is to provide<br />\naccess to music not otherwise available to<br />\nstudents, the Committee has concentrated on bringing in American and European avant-garde jazz artists. As a result<br />\nof its activities, the Committee is gaining<br />\na strong reputation for its willingness to<br />\nexplore alternative musical forms. The<br />\nGong music festival scheduled for Saturday night in Shriver Hall is the latest of<br />\nthe Committee's offerings. The performers will include Daevid Allen and Gong,<br />\nGilli Smyth's Mother Gong, Yochk'<br />\nSeffer'Neffesh Music from France, a jazz<br />\ngroup from Indianapolis named Maelstrom and Mars Everywhere of Washington D.C.

This year, the group,<br />\nNo Mercy, is billed as Baltimore's hottest<br />\nnew rock group. They have received<br />\nfavorable reviews from The City Paper<br />\nand The Unicorn Times. The band's<br />\nsuccess has led its members\u2014Ned Solomon, lead vocal and guitar, Matt Whealton, vocal and bass, John (Such) Suchi,<br />\nvocal and guitar, and Ira Katz, vocal and<br />\ndrums--to commit themselves to being<br />\nfull-time musicians and even to entertain<br />\nhopes of marketing their music nationwide.<br />\nNo Mercy's repretoire includes Funk,<br />\nCountry Rock, Rock & Roll, and Jazz.<br />\nThe group avoids radio-tired or mainstream songs.

Solomon suggests<br />\nthat some influences on his music have<br />\nbeen the work of Bruce Springstein, Elvis<br />\nCostello and Steely Dan. A jazz chord<br />\nstructure and the music of his parents'<br />\ngeneration underlie songs like \"From<br />\nWhere I Stand,\" among others.<br />\nWhealton, an anthropology major<br />\nfrom Virginia Beach, has had classical<br />\ntraining.

Previously he<br />\nplayed in a group called Heading West.<br />\n<br />\nthe clearly captivated audience sat around<br />\nthe dancefloor watching the band perform for the first set and a half without<br />\ndancing. Though Solomon's performance<br />\nseemed something to be watched rather<br />\nthan danced to at first, another reason for<br />\nthe hesitancy might be the difficulty of<br />\ndancing to music that doesn't have a<br />\n\"disco\" beat. Solomon feels there is a<br />\nneed for dance bands like No Mercy as an<br />\nalternative to disco, saying,\"people must<br />\nreadjust.\" The people at the Rat did<br />\nreadjust, crowding the dance floor and<br />\nadapting themselves in different ways to<br />\nNo Mercy expects their audiences to<br />\nrespond actively to their music.

Whealton and<br />\nSolomon are the only two band members<br />\nwho had worked together before becoming involved in No Mercy.<br />\nSolomon emphasizes that the character of No Mercy's performance is a key to<br />\nits popularity. The band usually dresses<br />\nin purple embroidered silk Karate jackets.<br />\nSolomon occasionally dons a white<br />\nsurgeon's suit and red plastic sun-glasses<br />\nout of whose Harlequin frames two little<br />\nMickey Mouse faces grin. Constantly<br />\nmoving with the music, Solomon will<br />\noften walk out onto the dance floor. For<br />\nfun, he will give the audience a long<br />\nround-about look with a dropped jaw or<br />\nsimilar expression.<br />\nWhen No Mercy appeared at the Rat,<br />\n<br />\nregulars already do this. According to<br />\nSolomon, No Mercy's music is \"slightly<br />\nHe says, \"We aren't<br />\ncontroversial.\"<br />\nwatered down to a common denominator.\" Hp also claims the group appeals to<br />\nan urban rather than a rural audience.<br />\nNo Mercy's game plan is to widen its<br />\ncircle of engagements to include Washington and, eventually, New York. The<br />\nband would like to do some bar work in<br />\nParis and London and record some demo<br />\ntapes for record companies in order to get<br />\nlimited air play on local stations; WRMW<br />\nin New York has already aired them. I<br />\nasked Solomon about the risks involved<br />\nin making a serious committment to the<br />\nband as a career. He felt it was a big risk,<br />\nbut added, \"We have confidence in our<br />\neffort.

Ono<br /><br />\nNuke Necessity letters to the<br />\neditor'<br /><br />\nLast week's mishap in the nuclear generating plant at<br />\nThree Mile Island, Pennsylvania, has suddenly raised<br />\nserious questions regarding the role which nuclear power<br />\nwill play in this country's future.<br />\nUnfortunately, the reactions of most Americans, even<br />\nthose who call themselves educated, has been to fly into a<br />\nblind, unthinking panic. Witness for example this statement made by Biophysics professor Richard Cone: \"I<br />\nwonder why it is that our political leadership, economic<br />\nleaders, and business leaders are all in concert saying that<br />\nwe need to produce energy at an ever-increasing rate.\"<br />\nThe reason is all too obvious. There is a direct correlation between horsepower applied per manhour of labor<br />\nand gross national product per capita for every nation in<br />\nthe world. And horsepower applied translates directly into<br />\nenergy.<br />\nLook at it another way. The world's population has<br />\ndoubled within the last 50 years. Think about that for a<br />\nsecond--it's staggering. The only way 3 billion people can<br />\nbe fed, much less clothed, housed, or given what we like to<br />\ncall in the U.S. a \"minimum\" standard of living, is through<br />\nthe application of energy.<br />\nThe energy sources which have sustained us over the<br />\npast two centuries since the Industrial Revolution are<br />\nlimited. Fossil fuels will run out. So far, nuclear power<br />\nis the most reliable means devised to replace them. It too is<br />\nultimately limited, but it is essential that it be exploited as<br />\nmuch as possible in the meantime. To turn our backs on<br />\nthe situation and deny the necessity of obtaining new<br />\nenergy supplies is to call forth disaster, a holocaust the<br />\nproportions of which we can scarcely conceive.<br />\nFurther, it has not been demonstrated that nuclear<br />\npower poses excessively serious public health hazards,<br />\nsensational motion pictures to the contrary notwithstanding. For all the intense publicity it received, not one<br />\nfatality resulted from the Three Mile Island accident,<br />\nnor was significant environmental damage caused. And-a<br />\nrecent computer study based on the Three Mile Island<br />\naccident predicted that even a worst-case meltdown would<br />\nhave been non-lethal.<br />\nAdmittedly, the continued use of nuclear power<br />\ngenerators does involve some safety_ risks. But many<br />\ndecisions we make every day, such as the decision to drive<br />\nan automobile on a public thoroughfare,involve such risks.<br />\nThe price for giving up nuclear power is just way too much<br />\nto pay.<br /><br />\nWelcome, WellERJ<br />\nThis week witnessed the first broadcasts of a fledgling<br />\nvoice at Johns Hopkins, WJHU-FM. The station has<br />\ntremendous potential to become an important part of the<br />\nmedia not only on the Hopkins campus but in the whole<br />\ncity. Station personnel, including especially Jud French,<br />\nhave done a great job of upgrading the facilities to achieve<br />\none of the best FM signals anywhere.<br />\nIf there is one area where the station's format must be<br />\nquestioned, it is the \"block programnyine concept it is<br />\nfollowing. With classical music during the day, jazz in the<br />\nmorning, and rock in the evenings, the station has no<br />\nconsistent personality which would enable it to develop a<br />\nconsistent listenership. But it will take several months<br />\nbefore the station's preference can be effectively evaluated.<br />\nIn any ease, we wish our baby media brother the best<br />\nof luck as it takes the air. If they find things a bit aggravating from time to time, they' will easily be able to understand how we must feel after 83 years.<br /><br />\nBye-Bye<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOver the past few years, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins News-Letter has<br />\nbeen a paradigm of irresponsible<br />\nand sophomoric journalism. Nevertheless, I consented to write<br />\nfor your publication feeling that<br />\nI could make some sort of<br />\npositive contribution towards<br />\nthe quality of the paper and my<br />\nown career. I even suffered<br />\nhaving my name printed on your<br />\neditorial page as a \"staff writer.\"<br />\nIn light of many abhorrent deeds<br />\nof yours which have recently<br />\ncome to my attention, in addition to various slanders, untruths, and injustices, which I<br />\nhave been forced to endure,<br />\nit is now my opinion that I have<br />\nmade a mistake.<br />\nI am unwilling and unable<br />\nto be a part of an organization<br />\nthat can blithely misquote people, distort facts, and fabricate<br />\nlies without the slightest regard<br />\nfor the grief and damage it<br />\ncauses. I refer here, to name a<br />\nfew, to the injustices recently<br />\nsuffered by WJHU and Jeff<br />\nMarks. I also refer to the outrageous and fantastic fabrications<br />\nwhich have appeared about me<br />\nin your last two (March 16<br />\nand 9)issues.<br />\nI an unwilling and unable to<br />\nbe associated with a publication<br />\nthat is incapable of accepting<br />\nblame or admitting a mistake, no<br />\nmatter how culpable the misdeed or damaging the mistake.<br />\nI am unwilling and unable<br />\nto sanction an organization<br />\nwhich routinely and recklessly<br />\nbreaks promises and ignores<br />\npreviously made commitments.<br />\nYou will please remove my<br />\nname from your membezship<br />\nlists, editorial headers, and any<br />\nother written materials and<br />\ncorrespondence, present and<br />\nfuture.<br /><br />\nlater we cannot share the same<br />\nkind of enthusiasm for the<br />\npre-medical program at Hopkins.<br />\nMany would assume that<br />\nthe quality of the program<br />\nwould be reflected in the rate of<br />\nacceptances to medical school.<br />\nOn the surface the evidence<br />\nseems very complimentary. Nationally, approximately one<br />\nthird of those who apply to<br />\nmedical school are accepted.<br />\nLast year, between sixty and<br />\nseventy per cent of those who<br />\napplied from Hopkins were<br />\naccepted into at least one<br />\nmedical school. This is a quite<br />\nimpressive statistic. However, an<br />\nextremely important fact has<br />\nbeen omitted. This academic<br />\nyear, the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool has accepted only three<br />\nstudents from our undergraduate<br />\nprogram. It appears that the<br />\nMedical Institution shows little<br />\nregard for its own undergrads.<br />\nThis raises several questions.<br />\nHow can other medical schools<br />\nthink highly of our pre-medical<br />\nprogram when our medical<br />\nschool, most familiar with the<br />\ncurriculum, does nothing to<br />\npromote us? How long will the<br />\nreputation of this school maintain its present level? Lastly, if<br />\nHopkins does see flaws in our<br />\nprogram, what is being done to<br />\nrectify them?<br />\nIt is worthwhile to look at<br />\nother highly ranked medical<br />\nschools and their attitudes towards their undergrads. Cornell<br />\nMedical College grants every<br />\nCornell undergrad an interview.<br />\nThe University of Pennsylvania<br />\nMedical School fills approximately one quarter of its class with<br />\nPenn applicants. The figures for<br />\nHarvard are similar. Why is<br />\nHopkins ignoring its undergrads?<br />\nSomething must be done and the<br />\nfirst step should be an explanation from Dr. Muller and the<br />\nadmissions committee at the<br />\nMedical School.<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nGeorge Petrossian<br />\nChuck McGlade<br /><br />\nWith regret,<br /><br />\nPre-Meds Erroneous<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nUpon graduation from High<br />\nSchool both of us were fairly<br />\ncertain that we would choose<br />\nmedicine as our career. With this<br />\nin mind, we decided to attend<br />\nJohns Hopkins because of its<br />\nreputation of having one of the<br />\nfinest pre-medical programs in<br />\nthe country. When close to one<br />\nhalf of our freshman class chose<br />\nto follow a pre-med program it<br />\nwas obvious that we were not<br />\nalone. Unfortunately, four years<br /><br />\ning of March 6th at which<br />\nPeabody students performed was<br />\nscheduled in September, 1978-several months before the<br />\nGoucher concert was arranged.<br />\n3. The resultant conflict<br />\nwhich deprived students of \"the<br />\nrare educational opportunity to<br />\nhear their teachers perform\" was<br />\nin no way caused by the Conservatory's scheduling.<br />\n4. The Conservatory did<br />\nnot profit in any way from the<br />\nGoucher concert.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nIrving Lowens<br />\nDean,Peabody Institute<br /><br />\nContrived<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs an ex-Peabody student--a<br />\nmusician who has gone into<br />\nanother profession--I would like<br />\nto comment on the recent article<br />\nby Harry Lerner about the<br />\nConservatory students' dissatisfaction with the orchestral curriculum and its conductor, because the facts are debatable,<br />\nand the implications fallacious.<br />\nIf the curriculum of a<br />\nconservatory is to be a sophisti- _<br />\ncated one, it should not rely<br />\nupon box-office popularity, or<br />\non the war-horses of the past. It<br />\nseems that Dr. Galkin is trying<br />\nto bring the Peabody curriculum<br />\ninto the 20th century. I wonder<br />\nwhat students in medicine or<br />\ndentistry, for example, would<br />\nthink if their curriculum did not<br />\nreflect the most contemporary<br />\ninformation about the field.<br />\nIt is naive to state that the<br />\neducation of Peabody students is<br />\nbeing \"eroded\" by the inclusion<br />\nof modern works and American<br />\nmusic. On the contrary; it can<br />\nonly be enhanced by them.<br />\nAnd, shouldn't the programs of the Conservatory set an<br />\nexample? If they are not more<br />\nadventurous than any others, at<br />\nthe vanguard of music, whose<br />\nwill be?<br />\nFinally, for a student to<br />\nstate that a conductor like<br />\nFrederik Prausnitz, who has an<br />\nextensive recording reputation,<br />\nwho has conducted throughout<br />\nEurope and the United States,<br />\nwhose BBC programs introduced<br />\nsome of the most difficult<br />\nnew music to the world, is<br />\n\"incompetent,\" is simply absurd. Just wait until that student<br />\nand his friends get out into the<br />\nfield; they'll find out what<br />\nincompetence is.<br />\nThe whole article, and the<br />\nfacts upon which it was based,<br />\nseem superficial and contrived.<br /><br />\nThe letter to the editor<br />\nsigned Edward H.

There<br />\nare possibilities for bringing the<br />\nmedia in or for people at the<br />\nschool to go out and talk on<br />\nissues more than they have been<br />\ndoing. There are opportunities<br />\nunparalleled anywhere in this<br />\nCongresscountry to bring<br />\nmen, senior Executive branch<br />\nofficials, foreign diplomats, and<br />\njournalists into the school to<br />\ninteract with students and faculty, which perhaps, could be<br />\nimproved.\"<br />\nPackard said that it was too<br />\nearly to propose any specific<br />\ninternal policy changes concerning such issues as the supposed<br />\nfactionalism among the junior<br />\nand senior faculty, enrollment,<br />\nand problems created by the<br />\nlarge percentage of part-time<br />\nfaculty employed by SAIS.<br />\nHe does favor the general<br />\nprinciple of a core international<br />\nrelations curriculum, which is<br />\nbeing discussed by a SAIS<br />\ncurriculum review committee.<br />\n\"There are certain parts of<br />\nInternational Relations which<br />\nshould be known by every SAIS<br />\ngraduate, that should define<br />\nwhat a SAIS graduate is,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nBefore he assumes his post,<br />\nDr. Packard plans to consult<br />\npeople both inside and outside<br />\nthe University in order to learn<br />\nwhat programs SAIS might wish<br />\nto adopt.

He will meet with its<br />\ndeal, a friend of his at Princeton, and Edmund Gulion, the<br />\nformer Dean.

He was cautiously optimistic about the future.<br />\n\"Fundraising is getting<br />\nrougher everywhere, particularly<br />\nin the foreign affairs field. I've<br />\nlearned here that the trend is<br />\naway from purely international<br />\ntype programs.

This \"Academic Curtain\" is most noticeable when a puff<br />\nof fresh air somehow manages to sneak through,<br />\nbringing with it a seldom-felt realization that<br />\nthere are indeed events and machinations<br />\noutside our tightly guarded perimeter which are<br />\nnot divided into semesters, credit hours or exam<br />\nperiods. This wind sends many darting to the<br />\nsafety of C-Level, where their sweaty palms<br />\nmay be dried on the pages of countless reassuringly silent tomes, but I, for one, always enjoy<br />\nthose rare Zephyrs for the sudden sense of<br />\nperspective they provide. It's for this reason<br />\nthat I always look forward to Spring Break as<br />\nwell--it's a chance to crash the gate and go<br />\nstrolling in the spring air--both physically and<br />\nfiguratively. If you play things the right way,<br />\nSpring Break can be the most essential course of<br />\nthe year, and the only one in which you can get<br />\na tan. This time around, Dixie Dick and I fled as<br />\nfar from Charm City as a Visa card would get us,<br />\nand ironically, I wound up learning more about<br />\nHopkins than anyplace else.<br />\nVirginia Tech is nestled, no...deposited, in a<br />\nbroad valley between the Blue Ridge and the<br />\nWest Virginia border, half a day from Baltimore<br />\nand a world away from Hopkins. It's protected<br />\nfrom the roar and diesel fumes of Interstate 81<br />\nby a sleepy hamlet with the sleepy name of<br />\nChristiansburg--a town which sports a Baptist<br />\nchurch every three blocks and a wild night<br />\nmaybe once a year. I'm told that folks from<br />\nChristiansburg don't often find an excuse<br />\nto go the four miles down the pike to Tech,and<br />\nthat such an arrangement suits the inhabitants of<br />\nboth places just dandy, thank you. It appears<br />\nthe good Citizens are skeptical of the Techies'<br />\nmoral fiber. You see, the students, by-in-large,<br />\nare not natives of the area, but rather hail from<br />\nNorthern Virginia, Southern Maryland, and<br />\nother localities too close to Babylon-on-the-Potomac and the gilded throne of Big Brother<br />\nfor comfort. The Christiansburgers don't like Big<br />\nGovernment, and anyone attending school on a<br />\nBig Government Quasi-Welfare Giveaway Grant<br />\nhas two strikes agin\"em,son.<br />\nBrave those extra four miles, however, and<br />\nthe stern, white steeples vanish from sight and<br />\nmind. Tech is before you--and, if you've become<br />\nas Hopkinized as I, an education concerning<br />\neducation will shortly ensue.<br />\nThe first thing which sets it apart from The<br />\nJohn is size--I mean,this joint is big. The campus<br />\nproper is over a mile on each side, presenting<br />\non first glance a jumble of high-rise dorms,<br />\nmammoth classroom buildings, broad streets,<br />\nand a central drill-field that mad swallow<br />\nHomewood whole. Wrapping around on three<br />\nsides, like protoplasm to a nucleus, is Blacksburg, Va.--an oasis of popular culture in the<br /><br />\nbleakest of the boonies. Finally, stretching over<br />\nthe valley floor toward a hazy range of hills, is<br />\nthe vast agricultural complex with its solar<br />\ncollectors and sleek windmills which beat the air<br />\nsilently in a lazy rhythm. On one of Spring's<br />\nfirst balmy days, with no classes in session,<br />\nit looked more like a languid resort than a<br />\nuniversity. Which brings us to the second big<br />\ndifference--it's a damn sight prettier than uptown Mobtown.<br />\nThe most 'noticeable edifice by far on the<br />\ncampus is mammoth Lane Stadium,60,000 seats<br />\nand still growing. Off-season Blue Jay jocks, who<br />\ncurrently amuse themselves by spitting across<br />\nthe width of Homewood Field, would drool<br />\nwith envy were they to get a chance to go for a<br />\nbomb in that Hillbilly Hippodrome. The press--box is three stories tall, air-conditioned, and in<br />\nconstant contact with the major capitols of the<br />\nworld. Dixie Dick was much affected.<br />\nThe name of Virginia Tech's team is the<br />\n\"Hokies.\" A hokie is--I kid you not--a castrated<br />\nturkey. You can imagine how- many times<br />\nduring the course of my brief stay the opportunity arose for a truly top-notch joke or comment<br />\nconcerning that ridiculous name, and I can't<br />\nremember how many times I bit my tongue and<br />\nheld my piece in order to avoid winding up<br />\nmuch like that unfortunate bird at the hands of<br />\nsome barrel-chested Techie. Actually, I can see a<br />\nglimmer of sense to the whole thing, for there<br />\nmust be great incentive forathletes not to screw<br />\nup when they know their team is named after<br />\nsome scrotumless fowl. With a name like that<br /><br />\nnot on particularly bad terms with their residential neighbors. Is this due, perhaps, to the<br />\nfact that Hokies don't .party as hard as our<br />\nGreek-letter laureates? I hardly think so, for one<br />\nnight Dixie Dick and I stumbled onto a frat<br />\nparty that was making enough noise to raise<br />\nRick Pfeffer's tenure chances, though we received repeated assurances that not half the<br />\nmembers had as yet returned from Spring<br />\nvacation. On the order of every twenty seconds<br />\nor so, a crouching figure would darken the<br />\nsecond-story ledge, swallow a shot-glass of liquid<br />\ncourage, and launch itself bravely into sublunar<br />\nspace, all the while emitting a piercing screech<br />\nknown in the vicinity as the Hokie Howl.<br />\n(Allegedly, the very noise an actual turkey<br />\nmakes in the short but painful process of becoming a Hokie). Determined to find out how the<br />\nbrothers got away with such obvious hooliganism, I marched over to a pair of twins, who<br />\nturned out after all to be only one person, and<br />\nasked him how he got the neighbors to put up<br />\nwith it.<br />\n\"Well,\" he reflected, \"they're not a bad<br />\nbunch, really. You just have to know how to<br />\nhandle 'em the right way. Like Mr. Fogbottorn,<br />\nnext door, he's a real ornery coot.\"<br />\nI looked across the hedge and beheld a<br />\ndarkened home that seemed to slumber peace-<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nSpring Break: Hopkins lies brooding under another Baltimore mist...<br />\nthey're playing catch-up before they ever take<br />\nthe field.<br />\nIt's no exaggeration to say that Baltimore is<br />\nindifferent to Hopkins. We are reminded daily,<br />\nespecially by those vociferous, letter-writing<br />\nHoppies who have matriculated and then settled<br />\ndown locally, that we are guests here who at<br />\nbest are to be grudgingly tolerated until such<br />\ntime as we can graduate and move back where<br />\nwe came from with all deliberate speed. Why<br />\nthese people see the need to turn on their<br />\nalma-mater with such vehemence is doubtless<br />\ndue to either insecurity at their first step in the<br />\nabove-mentioned \"Real World,\" or a generous<br />\nserving of sour grapes--but whatever the childish<br />\nphenomenon's cause, it does not exist at Tech.<br />\nBlacksburg and the Campus are, for the most<br />\npart, partners and not adversaries:. the plastic<br />\nseats at McDonalds are a Hokie maroon and<br />\norange; the lights at Burger King are tiny replicas<br />\nof Tech football helmets; and Wendy's offers<br />\nfree soft drinks during Homecoming. Tacky, but<br />\ntouching. Blacksburg is without a doubt a<br />\ncollege town, but it goes farther than local<br />\nmerchants knowing which side their bread is<br />\nbuttered on, for the whole atmosphere is more<br />\ncongenial whenever townie and student meet.<br />\nThe former actually seem glad to have a university in the vicinity, and are more amused than<br />\nscandalized over the occasional public excesses<br />\nof youth.<br />\nThere are over twenty fraternities at Tech,<br />\nbut unlike their Hopkins counterparts, they are<br /><br />\nfully in spite of the godawful racket. Indeed, not<br />\na light was burning from attic to cellar. \"Oh, I<br />\nsee. You have your parties while he's out.<br />\n\"You might say that,\" said my new friend, a<br />\nsmile of amusement spreading across his face:<br />\n\"As a matter of fact, here he comes nowFollowing the direction of his raised arm, I<br />\nsaw a visibly older figure weaving about on the<br />\nlanding, a half-empty bottle of Southern<br />\nComfort waving banner-like in his hand.<br />\n\"Look out below, you punks!\" he screamed,<br />\nstepping proudly off the ledge. \"Aaaiiiieeeee!\"<br />\n\"You ought to see him in a lampshade,\" said<br />\nmy pal, turning into the house. \"It's a real<br />\nscream.\"<br />\nAll in all, an ingenious solution.<br />\nThe townies by no means have a monopoly<br />\non the area's good nature. The students too<br />\nseem much more easygoing and friendly than<br />\nthey do here. Actually, easygoing is too mild a<br />\nword-there is a languor pervading the place<br />\nwhich made me feel like I was speeding all week<br />\nby comparison. They linger over coffee, pause<br />\nover pastry, and positively vegetate over burgers<br />\n'n beer. They think nothing of stopping half a<br />\ndozen times between the door and men's room<br />\nto talk with friends, casual acquaintances,<br />\nperfect strangers, and various janitorial personnel. Come to think of it, people just talked one<br />\nhell of a lot down there (by in large, people \"P<br />\nhere don't talk--they discuss).<br />\n. ld he<br />\nThe resurgence of this genteel art cou<br />\ndue in large measure to the fact that there iS<br /><br />\nresiD the<br /><br />\n5 our<br /><br />\nr one<br />\nfrat<br />\nraise<br />\n-e reI the<br />\npring<br />\nonds<br />\nPi the<br />\niquid<br />\nlunar<br />\nreech<br />\n-low!.<br />\nirkey<br />\n,comthe<br />\nliganwho<br />\n, and<br />\nIt up<br /><br />\nbad<br />\nw to<br />\ntom,<br />\nld a<br />\neace-<br /><br />\nlittle else to do in Blacksburg once the Alcoholic<br />\nBeverage Control store shuts down at sunset. No<br />\ntheatres, no museums, one moviehouse, and<br />\nintermittent T.V. call for desperate measures-like conversation. Considering our clientele,<br />\nHopkins was just built in the wrong place...distractionless Blacksburg is the nerd's paradise.<br />\n\"When we were your age, Roscoe, we didn't<br />\nhave a lot of fancy diversions...we had to make<br />\nour own fun.\" I always thought it was just another parental saying handed down from time<br />\nimmemorial, but the Hokies I met do just that,<br />\nand their production exceeds our paltry quotas<br />\nby a humiliating margin. They were continually<br />\npuzzled by my ceaseless urgings that we go<br />\nsomewhere and do something, and the visit was<br />\nnearly over before I realized that a little relaxation on my part would make such exertions<br />\nwholly unnecessary. Dixie Dick was quick to<br />\nassure me that such a tension-free atmosphere<br />\nwas due soley to the fact that we were now<br />\ndeep in the sunshine of \"God's Country,\" and<br />\nsafe from the fetters of Megalopolis, but I can't<br />\nhelp thinking that it was more than just a<br />\nquestion of geography.<br />\nOf course the Hokies do have some diversions that are denied to we quasi-Yankees. A few<br />\nminutes from campus, for instance, is the<br />\nCascade--a many-leveled waterfall which ends<br /><br />\nby party directives or papal bulls. They seem to<br />\nhave an art,(for an art it must be)for transforming extra pounds into extra charms. Don't<br />\nget me wrong, there are no more chubby women<br />\nper capita at Tech than anywhere else, but<br />\nthose who happen to be so are not autmatically<br />\ndumped into the sexual cut-out rack. I still don't<br />\nknow how they do it, (oh, subtle art!) but a<br />\nwoman who would be \"a real porker\" up here<br />\ncan only be described down there as \"having<br />\nclassical features.\"<br />\nWhen asked to sum up the Hokie Honeys,<br />\nDixie Dick, with his usual flair, stated: \"They're<br />\nprettier than Hopkins women, poorer than<br />\nGoucherettes, and friendlier than Damies.\" Well<br />\nsaid!<br />\nFriendlier they are indeed, and I don't mean<br />\nthat in a locker room, elbow-jabbing way either.<br />\nI mean they will actually talk to you without<br />\nnervously fingering their mace canisters. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, contact between the sexes seems<br />\nto proceed in an entirely different manner than<br />\nit does (or, more often, does not) at The John.<br />\nTech has no on-campus swillery (thank God)--collegiate meeting places, like all essential<br />\nservices, being provided by Blacksburg. At the<br />\ntown's half-dozen favorite rendevous, ranging<br />\nfrom Disco to coffee-house, you will not see the<br />\nfrustrating ritual which is performed nightly at<br />\nthe Rat. The various tables are not segregated by<br />\nsex, with lonely headhunters walking aimlessly<br />\nabout the aisles in search of a fortunate collision. On the contrary, almost all of the groups I<br />\nsaw were mixed before they came in the door,<br /><br />\nIs Apart<br />\nU,40<br />\n4Pp<br />\n4/<br /><br />\nU.<br /><br />\n1k1 t\u201e`<br /><br />\nnot<br />\nh,<br />\nLit.\"<br />\n1, a<br />\nace.<br />\nw.<br /><br />\nTi, I<br /><br />\nthe<br />\niern<br /><br />\nsaid<br />\nreal<br /><br />\n)oly<br />\ntoo<br /><br />\nha\"<br />\nId 3<br /><br />\nlace<br /><br />\n'eek<br />\ntuse<br />\nvers<br />\nif 3<br /><br />\n)001<br />\nCeS,<br /><br />\niOn-<br /><br />\nOne<br /><br />\nup<br /><br />\nI be<br />\ne is<br /><br />\n...while<br /><br />\nsprawls lazily in the sun,frosty brew in hand.<br /><br />\nabruptly in clear, shady pools.

It's made for geriatrics and union fishermen, and smells like my<br />\ndachschund's armpit to boot. Would you go<br />\ntubing on the Patapsco? No. Why bother when<br />\nyou can walk across it.<br />\nAnd now, let us turn to the women. Where<br />\nshould I begin? I suppose there is something to<br />\nbe said for the neo-fascist look which is currently the vogue in female fashion hereabouts. The<br />\nleather boots, rolled-up jeans, three-pound belt<br />\nbuckles, brass-studded blouses, and optional<br />\nriding crop that of late adorn our Towson<br />\ntootsies could conceivably cause a general<br />\ntumescence, provided of course that Hopkins<br />\nexclusively admitted S&amp;M bondage freaks or did<br />\nits recruiting only at White Power rallies. As for<br />\nthis reporter, the history textbooks are as close<br />\nas he cares to get to the Third Reich, and the<br />\nnightly display of blitzkrefig beauties is a bit<br />\nmore depressing than uplifting. On top of this,<br />\nsuch master-sex regalia depends upon the wearer<br />\npossessing immaculate, emaciated measurements<br />\n(a rare occurrence)--even the barest hint of a<br />\nmidriff bulge makes the costume laughable as<br />\nwell as frightening.<br />\nNot so with the beauties of Virginia's gentler<br />\n'clime. Their clothing is eclectic, unconstrained<br /><br />\nmaking it impossible to separate the friends<br />\nfrom the lovers. The expressions and antics of<br />\nthe assembled Hokies, however, made the Rat's<br />\nDisco Night look like a wake. There was no<br />\ntension, no \"dance 'n chance\" line ringing the<br />\ndisco floor, no disappointed drunks under the<br />\ntables. I guess what's so alien about the whole<br />\naffair is that the sexes at Tech seem much more<br />\nwilling to be friends. They don't seem to have<br />\nheard that males and females must necessarily be<br />\nsoldiers in separate, armed camps. Feature that.<br />\nBut then again, they can't be expected...after all.<br />\nwe're so advanced here at Hopkins.<br />\nI'm aware that this article is beginning to<br />\nsound like a press release from the Blacksburg<br />\nChamber of Commerce, so it's high time to<br />\nthrow all due light on the drawbacks of Hokieland. One which comes immediately to mind is<br />\nthe profusion of curfew regulations. it is hard,<br />\nwith memories of wide-open freshman dorms<br />\nstill vivid, to imagine other people's living<br />\nquarters being off-limits--especially to souls of<br />\nhigh moral character like Dixie Dick and myself.<br />\nSuch, however, is the sad case. Every dorm<br />\nseems to have its own peculiar set of restrictions,<br />\nbut in general, all males have to clear out of the<br />\nfemale dorms by the stroke of midnight. Failure<br />\nto comply results in a dreaded \"pink slip,\" two<br />\nresult in suspension, and three result in the<br />\nforfeiture of your first born. This is all medieval<br />\nenough,to be sure, but the worst is yet to come:<br />\nall females must be out of the male dorms by no<br />\nlater than two o'clock! How this holdover of<br /><br />\nante-helium barbarity has survived the sexual<br />\nrevolution, I am not prepared to guess, but I<br />\nassure you, the hardiest of Hokies get sweaty in<br />\nmixed company when the witching hour draws<br />\nnear. Imagine actually having to order a voluptuous female out of your room! What unthinkable perversity! But there is something eve<br />\nmore macabre, for on the top five floors of one<br />\ninfamous residence hall, no male is allowed at<br />\nany time for any reason. At Goucher, at least,<br />\nthey consider an escort to be a sufficient guardian of the general piece...1 mean peace. But<br />\nimagine, if you will, entire floors where the<br />\ntread of males is ne'er heard! And they call<br />\nthemselves a university! Still, rules are made to<br />\nbe broken, and that sucker is just asking for it--I<br />\nimagine it's a natural for Hell Week pledge<br />\nstunts.<br />\nThe other disappointment, as you might<br />\nimagine, is the quality of the academics. It'<br />\nrather difficult to refrain from a little intellectual snobbery, while visiting down there, but I<br />\nthink Dixie and I kept our noses out of the air<br />\nmost of the time. A short walk around the<br />\nbookstore or a longer chat with some of the<br />\nstudents makes it painfully clear that Tech is<br />\nnot in the same league with our expensive and<br />\nprestigious institution. Of course, you have to<br />\nrealize that Tech serves a different purpose<br />\naltogether from Hopkins,training people for the<br />\nno-nonsense world of business, insurance and<br />\nengineering. I've been told, and I have no doubt,<br />\nthat Virginia Tech turns out excellent accountants, businessmen, contractors, and the like-but<br />\nI doubt if they produce too many truly educa,<br />\n-ted people. Like I said, though, snobbery<br />\ndoesn't pay, because those same Hokies will<br />\nprobably have nice, steady jobs by the time I try<br />\nto hock my English diploma for one last, hot<br />\nmeal.<br />\nYou see,I was counting on academics to pull<br />\nme through-to enable me to look back at<br />\nsombre, sobe'r Hopkins. and sigh, \"Well, that':<br />\nthe price you have to pay for an education.'<br />\nUnfortunately, it hasn't proved enough, and my<br />\nstoicism has derailed. I like the way Hokies do<br />\nthings, and I don't see why we can't follow suit.<br />\nIt's funny...in the past, I'd always been skeptical<br />\nof those who said they were \"fed up\" with<br />\nHopkins' social life. I figured it was just an<br />\nexcuse for not being able to cope with the<br />\nacademics. After all, wasn't collegiate social life<br />\nthe same, hard grind everywhere? I thought<br />\nso-but now I've seen the other side of the<br />\nmountain--the streets, unlike ours, aren't paved<br />\nwith greeenbacks and prestige, but the natives<br />\nover there seem a damn sight happier all the<br /><br />\nsame.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 I APRIL 6, 1979<br /><br />\nOur Man In Bologna<br /><br />\nPiazza<br />\nPeyton<br />\nBY TOM SCHILLER<br />\nWell, since it is Friday night and it is pouring<br />\npitchforks outside, I guess that I can write an article for'<br />\nthe good ole Hopkins News-Letter)! hope that this one<br />\nwill at least be grammatically correct.<br />\nIt is semester.break now, and .some of the richer,<br />\ncareer conscious, adventurous, patriotic, or possibly<br />\nstupid students have gone off to Brussels on a mostexpenses paid trip that will probably consist of lectures<br />\non: \"Despite its problems the United States is still the<br />\ncenter of the universe. \"and :\" If the Russkies piss on<br />\nthe wrong side of the German border we will race over<br />\nthere and blow'em back to Siberia before they can zip<br />\ngoing up there<br />\nup their flys. I see no sense in<br />\nwhen I can stay in Bologna, doing things like: watering<br />\nplants, not spending money, teaching, and most importantly, making up an incomplete. Besides, Pink Floyd is<br />\non the radio.<br />\nToday there was a student demonstration: a monthly occurence here, and I was determined not to miss it. I<br />\nhad missed some of the earlier ones; which was too bad<br />\nbecause they had been rather lively (cars burned, cops<br />\ntear-gassing each other, and the sight of our director<br />\nwalking into a huge gas cloud and slowly disappearing.)<br />\nI selected a discreet but well located cafe, bought a<br />\nnewspaper and au expresso; and sat, looking out into<br />\ngloomy, rain soaked square with less than a hundred<br />\nvery wet and bedraggled demonstratos huddling under<br />\nthe surrounding porticos. After about forty-five minutes,<br />\nthere was a sudden stirring among them. I put down<br />\nthe crossword puzzle and went outside. Some of them<br />\nhad lined up behind a banner. I also noticed a great<br />\nmany carabinieri, some in full riot costume with truncheons and gas grenades, others in their picturesque<br />\nuniforms holding carbines and automatic rifles. The<br />\ndemonstrators shouted some slogans and the carabinieri<br />\nrustled ominously. I found that my hands, feet and<br />\nstomach were tingling, and it suddenly dawned on me<br />\nthat I was scared shitless. After all, before coming here,<br />\nthe most armed men I had ever seen at one time were<br />\nmarching down Fifth Avenue on Veterans day, 1964.<br />\nAnyway, the students marched off down a side street,<br />\nescorted by the carabinieri, who outnumbered them by<br />\nabout two to one. That was it. Although the journalist<br />\ninside me bemoaned the lack of violence, the chicken<br />\nwithin was quite relieved.<br />\nNow for some semi-facetious information. The<br />\nSAIS Bolgna center contains a small group of strangers,<br />\nall lumped together in a strange land. At best, a reasonably convivial bunch of people, at worst, a collection of<br />\ngossip mongering, cliquey, cutthroats. All this is exacerbated by the fact that there are only 110 of them. Be<br />\ncareful. The person sitting next to you could be sticking<br />\nthe dagger of innuendo in your back. Actually, it is<br />\nquite humorous when one considers the possibilities for<br />\na TV sitcom (Piazza Peyton?) and besides, it's fun to<br />\nstart scandalous rumours about people, and to hear<br />\nequally scandalous ones about yourself. The group is also<br />\npretty straight. Some of the second year European<br />\nstudents bemoan this.<br />\nThe classes are not small, except when it's an<br />\nadvanced seminar, or when the professor is awful(of<br />\ncourse, if the professor has a good rep, his classes are<br />\njammed.) The professors themselves vary. The center<br />\nseems to be a farm team for budding young SAIS<br />\nhotshots (Don't worry, kid, get a few years of experience under your belt, write a few things, and we'll call<br />\nyou up to the big time.), and a grab bag of European<br />\nprofessors with varying degrees of eminence, ability, and<br />\ncomprehension of English. The upshot? You can select<br />\na good group of courses with stimulating professors or<br />\nyou can end up with some real dogs. Most end up halt<br />\nand half.<br />\nI have no complaints about the Bologna center<br />\nadministration, but then, my philosophy is: The less<br />\none deals with an administrator, the better for both<br />\nparties. The director said the same thing in his opening<br />\naddress. And from what I have heard about last year's<br />\ngroup (The students, enlightened by some professors as<br />\nto some inequities existing at the center, made things a<br />\nbit hot. . .) he must be reasonably pleased by the quiesence which currently prevails. This change means one of<br />\ntwo things: either the center has improved, or we're<br />\ndon't<br />\nand<br />\nshafted<br />\ngetting<br /><br />\nrealize it. I don't know and frankly don't care. I'm<br />\nonly,here as an undergrad, not for a degree.<br />\nThe social scene at the center revolves around Ivo's<br />\nsnack bar; \"handily situated in the Hopkins center, a<br />\nplace where the elite meet to eat, drink and be merry.\"<br />\nIvo whips up and serves burgers, sandwiches, and hot<br />\ndogs (my faves)with a certain flair and occasional<br />\n3urliness. He also brews a mean,sometimes vitriolic cup<br />\n)f caffe that has No-Doze beat.Three little cups and yer<br />\nshakin' all over.<br />\nThe clientele is distinctly mixed. At luchtime there<br />\nis a long line of Italian students who desire, and can pay<br />\nfor American cooking. The tables are filled with an<br />\nincredible selection of people. At one table one might<br />\nfind some American med students discussing exams,<br />\nintestines, and football; at another some Germanophones reading the Frankfurter Zeitung and ignoring<br />\neveryone else; some nerds divying up a heavy assignment; some patriots declaiming loudly on the slovenliness of the Italians, the instability of the lira, the latest<br />\nshooting, and possibly nuking Iran; a professor looking<br />\nvery lost; twits drinking coffee with their pinkies out;<br />\ncool dudes chatting about drugs, punk rock and the<br />\nfutility of it all; and some Italian girls out to meet some<br />\n\"nice American boys,\" chattering and giggling like crazy.<br />\n(One might say they are birdbrained, but not me;<br />\nI'm going to their parties.) Personally, I go from table to<br />\ntable, sitting wherever I'm tolerated, but lately, as hinted<br />\nabove, I've settled down at the lattermost table. Why?<br />\nWell, like any nice (?) American boy, I have certain<br />\ndesires, and shit, it's been awhile.

Madison<br />\nAve. is about the best you'll be able to find in Baltimore.<br />\nLocated only a few blocks north of Peabody, Uncle<br />\nCharlie's might be a good place to go if you're up for a<br />\nlittle disco after your meal, for it's just around the<br />\ncorner from the Casablanca. It is easily accessible by bus<br />\nfrom Hopkins;the no. 3 or no. 11 will let you off within<br />\na block.<br />\nSince reservations are not accepted, you can head<br />\nfor Uncle Charlie's whenever a spur of the moment<br />\nimpulse to drop $30 on a dinner for two hits you. If the<br />\nplace happens to be full when you get there, don't<br />\nbe surprised if you are shanghaied and politely pushed<br /><br />\nWide Ch\u201crhe<br /><br />\nUncle Charlie's Bistro is a favorite haunt<br />\nof Hoppies and other eating fans.<br />\nupstairs to a lounge area to wait. But don't resist too<br />\nhard, you might miss a worthwhile part of the \u2022charm<br />\nassociated with going to Uncle Charlie's. There, in the<br />\nupper portion of the Chambord which opens onto<br />\nCharles St. ,you and your companion can chat and sip<br /><br />\nyour drinks while relaxing on plush velvet sofas amidst<br />\nornate tables and gilded mirrors. The layout is spacious.<br />\nA whole floor of the building is divided into enough<br />\nsalon-style rooms that you can have one all to yourself if<br />\nthe place is not too crowded.<br />\nMoving downstairs to begin your meal is like emerging from the 1890's into the 1970's . The general tone is<br />\nmuch lighter, with simple wood tables adorned by the<br />\ncandle light from small kerosene lamps. Still, the<br />\nrestaurant exudes a romantic kind of class, with fresh<br />\nred carnations at every table. The whole restaurant has<br />\nonly about fifteen tables, er )ugh to prevent any isolation anxiety. But the din is not so overpowering that<br />\nit prevents a dinner conversation. Although most<br />\ncustomers wear a coat and tie, the general pattern of<br />\ndress is not overly formal.<br />\nIn most restaurants in France, la carte is invariably<br />\nposted in the front window. At Uncle Charlie's the<br />\nmenu is an integral part of the decor, handwritten on<br />\ntwo large wall panels. Small enough to fit this format,<br />\nthe menu does not offer a tremendous range of choices,<br />\nbut still enough variety to please almost any palate. The<br />\nlist of entrees is evenly divided into meat and fish dishes,<br />\nwith a few not so French offerings thrown in for seasoning. There is also a choice of two soups and three<br />\nsalads.<br />\nThe house salad would have been a perfect combination of crisp escarole lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and<br />\ncucumbers had it not been topped with a bland dressing.<br />\nThe onion soup was piping hot with lots of cheese,<br />\nwhich made it especially good.<br />\nThe pork entree, called Cote de porc madere, was<br />\nalso done well, although the taste of Madeira wine after<br />\nwhich the dish is named was difficult to detect. The two<br />\nrather thick chops, cooked crisp around the edges, were<br />\naccompanied by some rather tasteless rice. However, the<br />\ncauliflower which also came, with the meal was excellent, tender but not overcooked. A shad, broiled to<br />\nperfection, was delicious. The dinner was set off nicely<br />\nby fresh, crusty French rolls, served warm with creamy<br />\nsweet butter in little ceramic bowls, a la francaise.<br />\nAlthough the portions are generous, save room for<br />\nthe desserts-they are excellent. To help you decide<br />\nwhich one to take, the waitress will bring a selection of<br />\npastries to your table, which might end up making<br />\nchoosing even more difficult. Two we tried were delicious; a light apple tart with a touch of marzipan and an<br />\napricot cream cake with walnut topping. Caffeine heads<br />\ncan top off their meal with a cup of good expresso.<br />\nOver all prices are neither cheap nor exhorbitant.<br />\nEntrees vary from $5.00 to $8.00, soups and salad were<br />\neach $1.75, while desserts were $1.75 and coffee was<br />\n$1.50 The wine list, however, was good but overpriced.<br />\nOne, La Vieille Ferme, which can be bought at Eddie's<br />\nfor $2.98, was $8.00. A Daquiri and Vodka Gimlet<br />\nwere each $1.75 upstairs. Altogether, dinner for two with<br />\ndrinks but no wine, came to about $30.00, tip included.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 15<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022e,<br />\nat S 11 4110\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series presents....<br /><br />\nMAN vs.NACHDLII<br />\nDOUBLE MAW=<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022.........<br /><br />\nADAM'S RIB<br />\nwith Spencer Tracy<br />\nand Katherine Hepburn<br /><br />\nApril 6/1sressee 14:00<br />\nApril 7/11eistssre 11734,0 11:30<br /><br />\nTHE PERFORMANCES ARE<br />\nALL EXCELLENT.

The first<br />\nmeeting for those interested in working<br />\non Downtown will be held Monday at 10<br />\np.m. in the Listening Viewing Room.<br />\nDowntown is an adaptation of a<br />\nshort story of the same name by Stuart<br />\nCohen. In early March, Cohen read the<br />\nstory to friends, including Kurt Kimmel<br />\nand Susan Anderson, who agreed that he<br />\nshould rework the piece for the stage.<br />\nAfter further discussions with Edmund<br />\nWhite, Charles Newman and Dr. Jerome<br />\nMcGann, Cohen approached George<br />\nOwen, Dean of the Homewood Faculties,<br />\nwith his idea. Owen liked the story and<br />\nencouraged Cohen to seek funds frorri the<br />\nUniversity for the project. Cohen then<br />\npresented his proposal to Chris Colombo<br />\nand the Union Programming Board. Just<br />\nbefore spring break, the Board agreed to<br />\nprovide a $350.00 grant to help meet the<br />\nexpenses involved in Downtown's production. The Student Council is also<br />\ninvestigating the possibility of supporting<br />\nthe project.<br />\nA group of students, including<br />\nCohen, Anderson and Kimmel, had been<br />\nworking on the project while efforts were<br />\nunderway to raise m oney. When the<br />\nUnion Board announced the making<br />\nof the grant, the plans the group had were<br />\nput in motion.<br />\nThe successful organization of the<br />\nDowntown project can be attributed<br />\nlargely to Cohen's energy and initiative.<br />\n\"I think my great contribution was<br />\nappreciation,. \" said Owen. \"He had to<br />\ngo out and beat the bushes for support.\"<br />\nEdmund White was impressed by<br />\nCohen's willingness to go out on a limb.<br />\n\"He shows unusual desire to be innovative in taking a story and translating it<br />\ninto stage terms\"<br />\nCohen never intended Downtown to<br />\nbe a conventional play. \"Things will be<br />\nhappening all over the theater, not just on<br />\nthe stage. Instead of having people come<br />\nand fix their gazes on something \u2014 like a<br />\nt.v. set -- we're going to put the audience<br />\ninside the t.v.\"<br /><br />\nThe actors will have a great deal of<br />\nfreedom in interpreting their roles, Cohen<br />\nstressed. \"We will be open to suggestions,\" he said. \"The stylization of the<br />\nroles will allow a lot of room for individual interpretation.\"<br />\nWhat the group needs now is student<br />\nparticipation, according to Cohen. \"We<br />\nneed a lot of technical people for special<br />\neffects, as well as actors,\" he said. Special<br />\neffects include ultraviolet and neon lights,<br />\na traffic signal, a soundtrack made up of<br /><br />\nsnatches of music, conversation and<br />\nurban noise, , and various \"totems of<br />\ndowntown.\"<br />\nAn innovative advertising campaign is<br />\nalso being planned to drum up student<br />\ninterest in Downtown; people with<br />\ninterests in creative advertising are<br />\nencouraged to become involved.<br />\nDowntown is one of several projects<br />\norganized by students on their own<br />\nduring the past year.

Solomon has also co-authored a<br /><br />\nfew songs with Whealton.<br />\nSome of Solomon's work such as,<br />\n\"Face Walks\", \"No One's Watching\",<br />\n\"Spy\", or \"Fixtures\" might be characterized as \"new wave rock.\" They all have a<br />\nmore mellow sound when played with<br />\nacoustic guitar, while the band gives them<br />\na driving and more aggressive quality; all<br />\nhave intricate lyrics. Solomon suggests<br />\nthat some influences on his music have<br />\nbeen the work of Bruce Springstein, Elvis<br />\nCostello and Steely Dan. A jazz chord<br />\nstructure and the music of his parents'<br />\ngeneration underlie songs like \"From<br />\nWhere I Stand,\" among others.<br />\nWhealton, an anthropology major<br />\nfrom Virginia Beach, has had classical<br />\ntraining.

Though Solomon's performance<br />\nseemed something to be watched rather<br />\nthan danced to at first, another reason for<br />\nthe hesitancy might be the difficulty of<br />\ndancing to music that doesn't have a<br />\n\"disco\" beat. Solomon feels there is a<br />\nneed for dance bands like No Mercy as an<br />\nalternative to disco, saying,\"people must<br />\nreadjust.\" The people at the Rat did<br />\nreadjust, crowding the dance floor and<br />\nadapting themselves in different ways to<br />\nNo Mercy expects their audiences to<br />\nrespond actively to their music.

For<br />\nfun, he will give the audience a long<br />\nround-about look with a dropped jaw or<br />\nsimilar expression.<br />\nWhen No Mercy appeared at the Rat,<br /><br />\nregulars already do this. According to<br />\nSolomon, No Mercy's music is \"slightly<br />\nHe says, \"We aren't<br />\ncontroversial.\"<br />\nwatered down to a common denominator.\" Hp also claims the group appeals to<br />\nan urban rather than a rural audience.<br />\nNo Mercy's game plan is to widen its<br />\ncircle of engagements to include Washington and, eventually, New York.
