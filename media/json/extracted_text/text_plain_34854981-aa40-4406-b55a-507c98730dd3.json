The game was<br />\nstarted at 8 P. B., and the field,<br />\nwhich was lighted by the strong<br />\nrays of forty-four 1,000-watt bulbs,<br />\nwas as light as day. The previous<br />\nSaturday, Syracuse had fought the<br />\nstrong western eleven from the University of Nebraska, the game being very close and both elevens<br />\nfighting like tigers. It was only<br />\nthrough sheer brute strength and<br />\nvery hard fighting, that Nebraska<br />\nwa sable to triumph over their opponents, winning by the score of 13<br />\nto 6. This year Syracuse is playing<br />\nthe majority of her games at night<br />\nunder the powerful arc lights and<br />\non her own gridiron.<br />\nNew Practice<br />\n<br />\nThe practice of playing football<br />\ngames at night is a new and experimental one. It is thought that<br />\nlarger crowds can be drawn to the<br />\nstadiums for these games by having<br />\nthem in the evenings. It is also<br />\nfelt that many of those people who<br />\nhave to work Saturday afternoons<br />\nand are necessairily kept from attending afternoon contests, would<br />\nbe interested in night games and<br />\nwould attend them.<br />\nNew Experience<br />\n<br />\nThis game was the first one that<br />\nHopkins had ever played at night<br />\nand naturally it was a novel experience for them. At first they were<br />\nnot used to the glaring lights, but<br />\nthey were soon able to acclimate<br />\nthemselves to this new situation and<br />\nto eliminate the confusion into<br />\nwhich they had been thrown at the<br />\nbeginning of the game.<br />\nHopkins Outclassed<br />\n<br />\nFrom the very start, it was easy<br />\nto see that Hopkins was outclassed<br />\nin every shape and form by the<br />\nstrong, well-experienced Syracuse<br />\neleven. Last year Syracuse had a<br />\nvery powerful team and defeated<br />\nHopkins by a large margin and the<br />\nteam this year is made up of most<br />\nof the old regulars from last season. Naturally these husky men,<br />\nwho had seen battle in more than<br />\none season, were more than a match<br />\nfor the crippled Jay team.<br />\nHopkins Alert<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the Jays were thoroughly outclassed, they nevertheless<br />\nshowed the old Hopkins fighting<br />\nspirit and were alert and always on<br />\nthe look-out for any breaks that<br />\nmight come their way. They were<br />\nrewarded, in the first part of the<br />\nlast quarter by a little streak of<br />\nluck, which netted them a touchdown.<br />\nJays Score<br />\n<br />\nThe Orange team had started<br />\nanother march down the field and<br />\nwere sure of scoring. A long forward pass was attempted and Merriken, Hopkins' right halfback intercepted it and made a beautiful<br />\nrun of 47 yards to place the ball<br />\non Syracuse's 10-yard line. After<br />\na forward pass had been grounded,<br />\nthe ball was given to Bledsoe, who<br />\ncarried it over for Hopkins' only<br />\ntally. The try for the extra point<br />\nfailed and the Jays were forced to<br />\ncontent themselves with the one<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 22, 1929<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nTHEJOHNSMILSIIEWSIETTER<br />\nFOUNDED 1897<br />\n<br />\n$2.00<br />\n<br />\nSubscription<br />\n<br />\nEntered as second-class matter Oecember 3, 1909, at the Postoffice in Baltimore,<br />\nMd., under the Act of Congress November 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished semi-weekly from October to June by the Students of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBusiness communications should be addressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.

This seemed to be expected by many who have been<br />\nheard to say, \"It did last pretty long, though.\" When the defect has<br />\nbeen repaired let us be content to enjoy it as an instrument and not<br />\na toy.<br />\nThe broken radio is not the only indication of the attitude we have<br />\nmentioned. Coats, hats, and books are to be seen nearly any hour of<br />\nthe day, strewn over chair backs, tables, or windowsills. Lockers have<br />\nbeen distributed for the disposition of our garments and texts during<br />\nthe hours of classes. During functions, we may check our coats at the<br />\nroom set aside for that purpose. Thoughtlessly tossed articles do not<br />\nadd to the appearance of the large lobby in Levering Hall.<br />\nAshes are flicked to the floor, although ash trays have been furnished<br />\nin abundance throughout the several rooms. Even if a tray is not<br />\nwithin reach, a few steps would bring it so. Cigarette ashes are not<br />\nallowed to remain on the floor, due to excellent janitor service; but<br />\ncertainly the sight of a student carelessly dropping ashes or the remnants of his \"smoke\" on the floor is not conducive to an appreciative<br />\nattitude in others.<br />\nLoud talk is becoming increasingly noticeable. One of the conditions<br />\nmost deplored by authorities was the speech and loudness of those who<br />\nfrequented the second floor of the Barn. Levering Hall is as much at<br />\nthe disposal of the young ladies of the University as at the disposal<br />\n. of the male students.

According to authorities, by authorities meaning<br />\nwitnesses, there is really a strong<br />\nfeeling that some day the R. 0. T.<br />\nC. will be able to obey commands<br />\nto a man. Not that they don't obey<br />\ncommands to a man right now, for<br />\nthey do, each man in his own way;<br />\nand really the individuality represented in the corps is worth noticing, and easily noticed.<br />\nBefore the first drill a notice<br />\nwas posted on the R. 0.

The<br />\nOpening of this building caps the end<br />\nof one of the most prosperous<br />\nyears of Hopkins' existence.<br />\nOther Hopkins Improvements<br /><br />\nDuring the past year Hopkins<br />\nhas taken such gigantic strides forward, that it now is one of the best<br />\nbalanced scientific schools in the<br />\nworld. 1929 has seen the formal<br />\ndedication of the new Fellowship<br />\nPlan, and the dedication of the<br />\nChair of Chemical Education. Hopkins has acquired one of the best<br />\nmedical libraries in the world, in<br />\nher new Welch Memorial Medical<br />\nLibrary. The Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute has been formally<br />\ndedicated. A new student-activities<br />\ncenter in Levering Hall has been<br />\nestablished. Few universities of our<br />\nsize in this country can boast of as<br />\nbeautiful a student-activities center<br />\nas Levering Hall. The Carroll<br />\nMansion is being remodeled into a<br />\nMuseum of Colonial Activities.<br />\nPlans have been formulated for a<br />\nbuilding opposite Carroll Mansion<br />\nto house this country's FIRST Institute of Laws. Even at the present time students are devoying much<br />\neffort for the erection of a new<br />\nCage or gymnasium at Homewood Field.

It contains four<br />\nlecture rooms, and twelve classrooms, as well as several laboratories, research rooms and offices.<br />\nThe building will be immediately occupied by the Mathematics and the<br />\nPhysics departments. In a statement<br />\nto the NEWS-LETTER reporter, Dr.<br />\nHubbard, Professor of Physics<br />\nStated:\"At the present time the new<br />\nPhysics Building is the MOST<br />\nmodern and best-designed physics<br />\nbuilding in this country, however,<br />\nI. do not expect it to hold that position for many years, for colleges<br />\nare jealous of honors, and some<br />\nOther university may soon erect a<br />\nstructure to rival ours in modernity.\"<br />\nTo Be Named By Trustees<br /><br />\nThe name for the building will<br />\nProbably be chosen on October 28<br />\nat the next meeting of the Board<br />\nof Trustee's of the University.

The game was<br />\nstarted at 8 P. B., and the field,<br />\nwhich was lighted by the strong<br />\nrays of forty-four 1,000-watt bulbs,<br />\nwas as light as day. The previous<br />\nSaturday, Syracuse had fought the<br />\nstrong western eleven from the University of Nebraska, the game being very close and both elevens<br />\nfighting like tigers. It was only<br />\nthrough sheer brute strength and<br />\nvery hard fighting, that Nebraska<br />\nwa sable to triumph over their opponents, winning by the score of 13<br />\nto 6. This year Syracuse is playing<br />\nthe majority of her games at night<br />\nunder the powerful arc lights and<br />\non her own gridiron.<br />\nNew Practice<br /><br />\nThe practice of playing football<br />\ngames at night is a new and experimental one. It is thought that<br />\nlarger crowds can be drawn to the<br />\nstadiums for these games by having<br />\nthem in the evenings. It is also<br />\nfelt that many of those people who<br />\nhave to work Saturday afternoons<br />\nand are necessairily kept from attending afternoon contests, would<br />\nbe interested in night games and<br />\nwould attend them.<br />\nNew Experience<br /><br />\nThis game was the first one that<br />\nHopkins had ever played at night<br />\nand naturally it was a novel experience for them. At first they were<br />\nnot used to the glaring lights, but<br />\nthey were soon able to acclimate<br />\nthemselves to this new situation and<br />\nto eliminate the confusion into<br />\nwhich they had been thrown at the<br />\nbeginning of the game.<br />\nHopkins Outclassed<br /><br />\nFrom the very start, it was easy<br />\nto see that Hopkins was outclassed<br />\nin every shape and form by the<br />\nstrong, well-experienced Syracuse<br />\neleven. Last year Syracuse had a<br />\nvery powerful team and defeated<br />\nHopkins by a large margin and the<br />\nteam this year is made up of most<br />\nof the old regulars from last season. Naturally these husky men,<br />\nwho had seen battle in more than<br />\none season, were more than a match<br />\nfor the crippled Jay team.<br />\nHopkins Alert<br /><br />\nAlthough the Jays were thoroughly outclassed, they nevertheless<br />\nshowed the old Hopkins fighting<br />\nspirit and were alert and always on<br />\nthe look-out for any breaks that<br />\nmight come their way. They were<br />\nrewarded, in the first part of the<br />\nlast quarter by a little streak of<br />\nluck, which netted them a touchdown.<br />\nJays Score<br /><br />\nThe Orange team had started<br />\nanother march down the field and<br />\nwere sure of scoring. A long forward pass was attempted and Merriken, Hopkins' right halfback intercepted it and made a beautiful<br />\nrun of 47 yards to place the ball<br />\non Syracuse's 10-yard line. After<br />\na forward pass had been grounded,<br />\nthe ball was given to Bledsoe, who<br />\ncarried it over for Hopkins' only<br />\ntally. The try for the extra point<br />\nfailed and the Jays were forced to<br />\ncontent themselves with the one<br />\ntouchdown.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 22, 1929<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHEJOHNSMILSIIEWSIETTER<br />\nFOUNDED 1897<br /><br />\n$2.00<br /><br />\nSubscription<br /><br />\nEntered as second-class matter Oecember 3, 1909, at the Postoffice in Baltimore,<br />\nMd., under the Act of Congress November 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished semi-weekly from October to June by the Students of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBusiness communications should be addressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.

Don't grin like<br />\nthat, we mean it; in fact it is the<br />\nactual truth. Only notice, please,<br />\nthat we did not say has developed,<br />\nbut is developing. According to authorities, by authorities meaning<br />\nwitnesses, there is really a strong<br />\nfeeling that some day the R. 0. T.<br />\nC. will be able to obey commands<br />\nto a man. Not that they don't obey<br />\ncommands to a man right now, for<br />\nthey do, each man in his own way;<br />\nand really the individuality represented in the corps is worth noticing, and easily noticed.<br />\nBefore the first drill a notice<br />\nwas posted on the R. 0. T. C. bulletin board giving the following orders: \"As the student officers will<br />\nconduct this drill, it is strongly advised that all privates study the lesson will, and know what to do without being told.\" Now from reliable<br />\nsources we have learned that these<br />\norders were carried out, that the<br />\nfellows in the ranks actually knew<br />\nwhat to do without being told, so<br />\nthe question is: \"What could have<br />\ncaused the conditions in the drill<br /><br />\nmentioned above?\" We will not try<br />\nto decide this very debatable question, but will leave it to your own<br />\ncapable reasoning powers.<br />\nLast Thursday such progress had<br />\nbeen made, that it was really possible and within the power of the officers to have their squads march<br />\nwherever, they (the officers) willed.<br />\nIncidentally there was a small<br />\ngroup of the admiring, and admired,<br />\nfair sex, walking down one side of<br />\nthe quadrangle.

The officers<br />\nof another squad catching on to the<br />\nplot also used the aforementioned<br />\nmaneuvers to bring his men directly in the path of any retreat which<br />\nthese members of the weaker sex<br />\nmight be contemplating. Now this<br />\ncomplicated matters, for not only<br />\nwere the girls hemmed in on all<br />\nsides, but also the squad were in<br />\nsuch a position as not to be able to<br />\nextricate themselves with facility or<br />\nmilitary dignity.
