The Social Science Group<br />\nincudes the subjects of History,<br />\n_)olitical Economy, Political Science,<br />\nHistory of Philosophy, Ethics, and<br />\nEducation; the Natural Sciences<br />\ncomprise Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, and Logic; and the Literature and Language Group is made<br />\nup of the subjects of English,<br />\nFren_ch, German, Italian, Spanish,<br />\nLatin, Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit, and<br />\nArchaeology.<br />\nThe purpose of<br />\ngrouping related subjects into the<br />\none unit, it was stated by Dr. W. S.<br />\nHolt, associate in American History, and Chairman of the Social<br />\nScience Group, is that the student's<br />\nknowledge may not be limited to the<br />\nspecific subject in which he is interested, but that he may have a<br />\ngeneral acquaintance with related\u00b7<br />\nfields of knowledge. In the Social<br />\nScience Group, one must prove his<br />\nfamiliarity with all the subjects in<br />\nthe Group, at least generally, besides fulfilling his obligations to his<br />\nparticular subject.<br />\nBefore a student in the Social<br />\nScience Group may graduate, he<br />\nmust take a comprehensive examination on the following points, which<br />\nare given as they will apear in the<br />\n1932-33 University Catalogue:<br />\nGroup Requirements<br />\n<br />\nA knowledge of economic<br />\ngeography.<br />\nA knowledge of international<br />\nproblems and organization in<br />\nmodern times.<br />\nA knowledge of the principal<br />\ngovernments of the world, and<br />\nhow they function.<br />\nAn acquaintance with the more<br />\nimportant political and economic<br />\ntheories of the past and present,<br />\nand of their historical setting.<br />\nA knowledge of modern European history.<br />\nA knowledge of the history of<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nAn appreciation of the methods of the social sciences.<br />\n<br />\nA knowledge of the characteristics forms of the economic systems of the past ad present, of<br />\nthe causes and consequences of<br />\nthe economic development of the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nThe nature of this comprehensive<br />\nexamination is \u00b7an outline specifically indicating the points which the<br />\nstudent is to find out by research,<br />\nand he will be allowed four weeks<br />\nin which to complete the problem.<br />\nThe first comprehensive will be<br />\ngiven in May, 1933.<br />\nIt was<br />\nemphasised by Dr. Holt that these<br />\nreqttirements are those of the<br />\nGroup alone. Each Department in<br />\nthe Group may make its own specifications as to the knowledge of the<br />\nstudent, and may require that he<br />\n\u00b7 ~.kt:i.mvf~dg~ ;<br />\n\u00b7<br />\ncourses, research, reading, or by<br />\nany other method which it desires.<br />\nAs far as the Group is concerned, it<br />\nmakes no difference how the student<br />\nprepares for his comprehensive<br />\nexam, Dr. Holt declared. Furthermore, the exam, which is given each<br />\nyear, may be taken regardless of<br />\nthe number of years the student has<br />\nbeen in the college. Thus, especially industrious ones may graduate<br />\nafter their Junior year.<br />\nPersonal Research<br />\n<br />\nThis conception of the comprehensive examination is identical<br />\nwith the idea of the term paper,<br />\nrecently set forth by a local college,<br />\ninsofar as it permits the student to<br />\ncarry on a research of his subject on<br />\nhis own account. The department<br />\nmay require him to satisfy its<br />\nspecifications either by examination<br />\nor any other means it may determine upon. He will be assigned to<br />\na faculty adviser who will be able<br />\nto direct his method of approach to<br />\nthe completion of his work.<br />\nA plan whereby classes would be<br />\nsuspended for given periods of<br />\npossibly a month in duration, dur\u00b7<br />\n\u00b7<br />\nmg<br />\nwh.1c h time<br />\nt h e stu d ent wou ld<br />\ncarry out a program of reading on<br />\na subject assigned him and turn in<br />\na report on his work, is under consideration by the Social Science<br />\nGroup, Dr. Holt stated. He regards as a possible impediment to<br />\nthe smoothness of this plan, however, the fact that instructors in all<br />\nthe Groups may not be willing to<br />\nsuspend their classes at the same<br />\ntime, if at all. Having to attend any<br />\nclasses would disturb an uninterrupted reading period and cause it<br />\nto lose its effectiveness, it is believed. It is hoped, however, that an<br />\narrangement may be made for the<br />\neffecting of the idea.<br />\nThe Natural Science Group, of<br />\nwhich Dr. Gordon F.

However, this applies ol.'ily to candidates<br />\nfor the A.B. who have completed<br />\nthe regular collegiate requirements<br />\nfor tllillfllt and second years of<br />\n~~ - --~ --- ___<br />\nGroups Of Related Subjects<br /><br />\nEach of the three groups is made<br />\nup of departments of related subjects. The Social Science Group<br />\nincudes the subjects of History,<br />\n_)olitical Economy, Political Science,<br />\nHistory of Philosophy, Ethics, and<br />\nEducation; the Natural Sciences<br />\ncomprise Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, and Logic; and the Literature and Language Group is made<br />\nup of the subjects of English,<br />\nFren_ch, German, Italian, Spanish,<br />\nLatin, Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit, and<br />\nArchaeology.<br />\nThe purpose of<br />\ngrouping related subjects into the<br />\none unit, it was stated by Dr. W. S.<br />\nHolt, associate in American History, and Chairman of the Social<br />\nScience Group, is that the student's<br />\nknowledge may not be limited to the<br />\nspecific subject in which he is interested, but that he may have a<br />\ngeneral acquaintance with related\u00b7<br />\nfields of knowledge. In the Social<br />\nScience Group, one must prove his<br />\nfamiliarity with all the subjects in<br />\nthe Group, at least generally, besides fulfilling his obligations to his<br />\nparticular subject.<br />\nBefore a student in the Social<br />\nScience Group may graduate, he<br />\nmust take a comprehensive examination on the following points, which<br />\nare given as they will apear in the<br />\n1932-33 University Catalogue:<br />\nGroup Requirements<br /><br />\nA knowledge of economic<br />\ngeography.<br />\nA knowledge of international<br />\nproblems and organization in<br />\nmodern times.<br />\nA knowledge of the principal<br />\ngovernments of the world, and<br />\nhow they function.<br />\nAn acquaintance with the more<br />\nimportant political and economic<br />\ntheories of the past and present,<br />\nand of their historical setting.<br />\nA knowledge of modern European history.<br />\nA knowledge of the history of<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nAn appreciation of the methods of the social sciences.<br /><br />\nA knowledge of the characteristics forms of the economic systems of the past ad present, of<br />\nthe causes and consequences of<br />\nthe economic development of the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nThe nature of this comprehensive<br />\nexamination is \u00b7an outline specifically indicating the points which the<br />\nstudent is to find out by research,<br />\nand he will be allowed four weeks<br />\nin which to complete the problem.<br />\nThe first comprehensive will be<br />\ngiven in May, 1933.<br />\nIt was<br />\nemphasised by Dr. Holt that these<br />\nreqttirements are those of the<br />\nGroup alone. Each Department in<br />\nthe Group may make its own specifications as to the knowledge of the<br />\nstudent, and may require that he<br />\n\u00b7 ~.kt:i.mvf~dg~ ;<br />\n\u00b7<br />\ncourses, research, reading, or by<br />\nany other method which it desires.<br />\nAs far as the Group is concerned, it<br />\nmakes no difference how the student<br />\nprepares for his comprehensive<br />\nexam, Dr. Holt declared. Furthermore, the exam, which is given each<br />\nyear, may be taken regardless of<br />\nthe number of years the student has<br />\nbeen in the college. Thus, especially industrious ones may graduate<br />\nafter their Junior year.<br />\nPersonal Research<br /><br />\nThis conception of the comprehensive examination is identical<br />\nwith the idea of the term paper,<br />\nrecently set forth by a local college,<br />\ninsofar as it permits the student to<br />\ncarry on a research of his subject on<br />\nhis own account. The department<br />\nmay require him to satisfy its<br />\nspecifications either by examination<br />\nor any other means it may determine upon. He will be assigned to<br />\na faculty adviser who will be able<br />\nto direct his method of approach to<br />\nthe completion of his work.<br />\nA plan whereby classes would be<br />\nsuspended for given periods of<br />\npossibly a month in duration, dur\u00b7<br />\n\u00b7<br />\nmg<br />\nwh.1c h time<br />\nt h e stu d ent wou ld<br />\ncarry out a program of reading on<br />\na subject assigned him and turn in<br />\na report on his work, is under consideration by the Social Science<br />\nGroup, Dr. Holt stated. He regards as a possible impediment to<br />\nthe smoothness of this plan, however, the fact that instructors in all<br />\nthe Groups may not be willing to<br />\nsuspend their classes at the same<br />\ntime, if at all. Having to attend any<br />\nclasses would disturb an uninterrupted reading period and cause it<br />\nto lose its effectiveness, it is believed. It is hoped, however, that an<br />\narrangement may be made for the<br />\neffecting of the idea.<br />\nThe Natural Science Group, of<br />\nwhich Dr. Gordon F.
