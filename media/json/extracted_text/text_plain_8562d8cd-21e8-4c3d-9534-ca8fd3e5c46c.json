BuCh, M.S., Ch.E., came<br />\n<br />\nto the Engineering Development Section of Du Pont's Grasselli Research Division from<br />\nthe University of Louisville four years ago. Since then, he has<br />\nengaged in many kinds of chemical engineering work,from pilotplant operation to evaluation of the potential of proposed research programs. Within the last year, Bob has taken the responsibility of procuring B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. technical graduates in all phases of chemistry and chemical engineering for the<br />\nGrasselli Research Division.<br />\n<br />\nAN advanced degree would undoubtedly have a favorable<br />\nM effect in technical work, John, but let me enlarge on<br />\nthat just a little. In your own field (and mine, too) a<br />\nhigher degree is considered to be evidence of ability in<br />\ncarrying out original research. It is therefore helpful in<br />\nobtaining work in research and development, where that<br />\nskill is definitely important. You might say that it gives a<br />\nman a head start in proving his ability in those areas.<br />\nIt's less important in some other areas, though. For<br />\nexample, in production or sales work ability for handling<br />\nhuman relationships is just as important for advancement<br />\nas technical competence. If an engineer is sold on production\" work or sales, a graduate degree in marketing<br />\nor business administration might be more helpful to him<br />\nthan advanced technical training in getting started.<br />\n<br />\nBut I've noticed this at Du Pont. Once-a man lands a<br />\njob in his chosen field and actually begins to work, his<br />\nsubsequent advancement depends more on demonstrated<br />\nability than on college degrees. That's true throughout<br />\nthe entire company\u2014in scientific work, administration,<br />\nor what not.<br />\nSo an advanced degree is not a royal road to anything<br />\nat Du Pont, John. But when coupled with proven abilities, it is unquestionably helpful to a man in research and<br />\ndevelopment work. It often gets him off to a faster start.<br />\nAre you Interested In research work?<br />\n<br />\nAbout 2,000 Du Pont scientists are currently engaged in<br />\nresearch, aided by some 3,500 other employees.

BuCh, M.S., Ch.E., came<br /><br />\nto the Engineering Development Section of Du Pont's Grasselli Research Division from<br />\nthe University of Louisville four years ago. Since then, he has<br />\nengaged in many kinds of chemical engineering work,from pilotplant operation to evaluation of the potential of proposed research programs. Within the last year, Bob has taken the responsibility of procuring B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. technical graduates in all phases of chemistry and chemical engineering for the<br />\nGrasselli Research Division.<br /><br />\nAN advanced degree would undoubtedly have a favorable<br />\nM effect in technical work, John, but let me enlarge on<br />\nthat just a little. In your own field (and mine, too) a<br />\nhigher degree is considered to be evidence of ability in<br />\ncarrying out original research. It is therefore helpful in<br />\nobtaining work in research and development, where that<br />\nskill is definitely important. You might say that it gives a<br />\nman a head start in proving his ability in those areas.<br />\nIt's less important in some other areas, though. For<br />\nexample, in production or sales work ability for handling<br />\nhuman relationships is just as important for advancement<br />\nas technical competence. If an engineer is sold on production\" work or sales, a graduate degree in marketing<br />\nor business administration might be more helpful to him<br />\nthan advanced technical training in getting started.<br /><br />\nBut I've noticed this at Du Pont. Once-a man lands a<br />\njob in his chosen field and actually begins to work, his<br />\nsubsequent advancement depends more on demonstrated<br />\nability than on college degrees. That's true throughout<br />\nthe entire company\u2014in scientific work, administration,<br />\nor what not.<br />\nSo an advanced degree is not a royal road to anything<br />\nat Du Pont, John. But when coupled with proven abilities, it is unquestionably helpful to a man in research and<br />\ndevelopment work. It often gets him off to a faster start.<br />\nAre you Interested In research work?<br /><br />\nAbout 2,000 Du Pont scientists are currently engaged in<br />\nresearch, aided by some 3,500 other employees.
