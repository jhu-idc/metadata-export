which occurs in three different ways:<br />\n1. Approximately 30% of the students polled admit to some form of cheating.<br />\n2. The students polled estimated that about 30% of Hopkins\u2022students cheat.<br />\n3. More than half of the students polled have seen some form of cheating. It is important to note that there is a good correlation<br />\nbetween these three indications of the amount of cheating which occurs.<br />\nThe most important question indicated about how many students would follow the Honor Code by turning in cheating. Two-thirds of<br />\nthose polled say they would not turn in cheating, while about 50% pf those who have seen cheating say they would not turn it in.<br />\nThe actual figures are not important but rather only serve to give general indications.

Moreover, the extension<br />\nfor certain classes, such as freshman Chem last year, so that<br />\nstudents can see their midterms before deciding whtther or<br />\nnot to drop a course, indicates that the administration has<br />\nfound a later drop date to be beneficial to students, at least<br />\nin some respects.<br />\nDierman's argument for moving back the add-drop date is<br />\na woefully unconvincing one, motivated by a concern for<br />\nclerical convenience rather than what students have felt and<br />\ncontinue to .feel is in their best interest.

If<br />\nso, it's a shame, for no other<br />\nreason than that few Hoppiekely<br />\nto have encountered Stone Soup.<br />\nStone Soup is a natural food<br />\nrestaurant at 3713 Greenmount,<br />\none of the ndtural food operations<br />\nto have in the neighborhood since<br />\nthe fall.<br />\nFrom the front, Stone Soup is<br />\nstrikingly attractive. A small<br />\nwooden table, chairs, and pots.<br />\nFoliage on the floor and hanging<br />\nfrom the ceiling adorns the<br />\nwindow. Peering through the<br />\ngreens, one sees a scene totally<br />\nlacking in pretension. Tables and<br />\nchairs for eating, and the kitchen<br />\nin the back where food is being<br />\nprepared in plain view. Upon my<br />\narrival a young man named Kevin<br />\noffered to show me around. Above<br />\naverage height, comfortably<br />\ndressed, with red hair and a beard<br />\nwhich made hntly reminiscent of<br />\nBill Walton, Kevin proved a<br />\nfriendly and interesting host. He<br />\nsuggested that I tag along for a<br />\nwhile and watch the way things<br />\nwere done.<br />\nKevin quickly became involved<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\n,To the Editor:<br />\nThere's something in a name or<br />\nso I thought. When I first came to<br />\nthis University, I didn't expect to<br />\nfind too much attached to the<br />\nstigma of being a Johns Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate and I was right. The<br />\ncafeteria was typical, student<br />\nfacilities adaquate, courses-well, as<br />\nwith anything else, you learn to<br />\ntake the good with the bad. But<br />\none thing I did expect to be of<br />\nperhaps higher caliber was the<br />\ninfirmary service. Subsequent<br />\nexperiences, however, have proved<br />\nmy expectations were a bit too<br />\nhigh.<br />\nThe first time I had the<br />\nopportunity to take advantage of<br />\nthe infirmary's service was in<br />\nSeptember. I remember walking<br />\n'Axe.<br />\n<br />\nare concerned. I suggest a thorough<br />\nevaluation of these. Not only is it<br />\nhypocritical, but also embarassing<br />\nthat at a university which owes so<br />\nmuch to the extensive reputation it<br />\nhas retained in the field of<br />\nmedicine, its undergraduates<br />\nshould be rediced to wandering<br />\naround campus querying \"Is there<br />\na doctor in this house?\"<br />\nMichele Davis<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would just like to thank the<br />\nNews-Utter for giving credit where<br />\ncredit is due and besides I wrote a<br />\ngreat housing report.<br />\nMike Lenardo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI wish to congratulate The<br />\nCc,<br />\n<br />\nQ.CNC<br />\n<br />\n$<br />\n<br />\ndesk and was told to be seated.<br />\nFive minutes later I was called in<br />\nto be examined. The nurse was<br />\nkindly--took my temperature-even<br />\nchecked my pulse. She gave me a<br />\nvariety of medicines and told me<br />\nto check back in a few weeks if I<br />\nwasn't feeling any better. In a<br />\nhoarse whisper I gave my thanks<br />\nand left. Two weeks later, I was<br />\nback. This time I received a new<br />\nvariety of pills and a large can of<br />\napple juice, A & P Brand, which I<br />\nwas told to drink as soon as<br />\npossible. I complied.<br />\nThat weekend will no be quickly<br />\nforgotten. Sure that I would never<br />\nlive to see another Monday, I<br />\ndirected my roommate to call the<br />\nnurse on duty. She did so and told<br />\nher of my dire condition. The<br />\nnurse laughed, told me not to eat<br />\nfor a few days and I would feel<br />\nbetter.<br />\nWell, luckily, someone took<br />\npity. In the months that followed,<br />\nI had my bouts with various things<br />\nbut none -that took me to those<br />\ndreaded infirmary steps.<br />\nUnfortunately, though, I was not<br />\nto escape entirely. Late in March,<br />\n\"Hopkins Creeping Crud\"<br />\n, overtook the school and .1 found<br />\nmyself stretched out again. I went<br />\nto the nurse and as she shoved a<br />\nthermometer in my mouth, she<br />\ntold me of the history of viruses<br />\nand of the value of drinking eight<br />\nglasses of water a day. Five days in<br />\nbed convinced me that eight glasses<br />\nof water were just not enough but<br />\nI seemed to be doing better and<br />\nluckily in a few days I would be<br />\ngoing home.<br />\nAt home I ckecked with my<br />\ndoctor who told me that I had<br />\nbeen very ill and asked me why I<br />\nhadn't had a throat culture or a<br />\nblood test taken. I shrugged<br />\nignorantly-afterall I wasn't even a<br />\npre-med. When I told him that I<br />\nwent to Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nhe guffawed and commented that<br />\nit seemed odd to him that with all<br />\nthe great practitioners there, they<br />\ncouldn't even diagnose a simple flu<br />\nor virus correctly. When asked if I<br />\nhad been to see a doctor, I<br />\nshrugged again and told him that<br />\nonly if you were dying of infection<br />\nwould a doctor examine<br />\nyou-otherwise you were at the<br />\nmercy of the nurses.<br />\nThe moral or conclusion of this<br />\nstory is that, based on personal<br />\nexperience and those recounted to<br />\nme, it would seem that this<br />\nuniversity has been negligent as far<br />\nas undergraduate health facilities<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\nII7<br />\n<br />\n2,As1c<br />\n<br />\nav\u2018.<br />\n<br />\nore's two ''major\"<br />\nnewspapers. Franz Wittelsberger's<br />\nassault of Rodney Rullman was the<br />\nmost brutal, deliberate, and<br />\nmalicious attempt to injure a<br />\nplayer that I have ever witnessed in<br />\na nonprofessional sport.<br />\nWit telsberger was fifteen yards<br />\naway from Rullman, and,contrary<br />\nto Coach Ciccarone's account, did<br />\nnot start his movement until after.<br />\nRullman had cleared the ball. As if<br />\nthis were not enough, the behavior<br />\nof the Hopkins fans was so<br />\nboorish, mindless, and disgusting<br />\nthat had I closed my eyes I would<br />\nhave sworn that I was at Byrd<br />\nStadium in College Park among a<br />\ngroup of rabid Maryland<br />\nsupporters. On the whole,it was a<br />\nsad and dismal, day for Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nJoseph J. Jaffa<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in reference to the<br />\nabundance of idiotic comments<br />\nand personal opinions about Franz<br />\nWittelsberger and his LaCrosse<br />\ntactics. I specifically write to Blaise<br />\nChromiak who found it necessary<br />\nto conjecture that \"Wittelsberger's<br />\nbrutal attack on the Virginia goalie<br />\nwas seemingly intentional\" and<br />\nthat \"he [Franz] had seen the ball<br />\nbeing passed off.\" How is it that<br />\nanyone is able to suggest another<br />\nperson's intentions?<br />\nI've been told that a fool is a<br />\nperson who feels he must preach,<br />\n'even when he knows nothing of<br />\nthe subject. How much could Mr.<br />\nChromiak, know about LaCrosse<br />\nor any other contact sport when he<br />\nwrites that an athlete should not<br />\nplay in a game if he is planning on<br />\npurposely hurting another. He<br />\nwent on to say that hurting<br />\nanother player is in \"flagrant<br />\nviolation of the idea of sports.\"<br />\nWhat is it that he would suggest<br />\nMuhammad Ali do in the<br />\nring-dance the night away? Or<br />\nthat the ,Black Hawks perfect their<br />\nfigure skating techniques?<br />\nIt so happens that in LaCrosse<br />\nand many other contact sports the<br />\nplayers are trained in hitting skills.<br />\nAt the risk of sounding<br />\nhypocritical I would venture to say<br />\nthat these players are aware of the<br />\nfact that they may be injured at<br />\nany time during a game. The<br />\nofficials have not defined \"brutal,\"<br />\nthey have defined legal and illegal<br />\nhits however. I cannot say whether<br />\nFranz' hit was legal or not but to<br />\nme it was a hit as any other and<br />\nwell executed.<br />\nIt was unfortunate that<br />\nHa I t<br />\n<br />\nRullman, Virginia's goalie, was<br />\npetite, but the Evening Sun of<br />\nMarch 25, 1975 reports that<br />\nRullman was treated for minor<br />\ncuts at Union Memorial Hospital<br />\nand released.<br />\nIf you can't stomach the<br />\nHopkins weekly violence, don't.<br />\nNikki Zollar<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nPerhaps this is neither the<br />\nproper issue nor the proper forum<br />\nto raise this argument but I feel a<br />\nneed to anyway, in light of the<br />\naspersions that have been cast at<br />\nthe hoary old game of lacrosse as<br />\nwe play it here at the top.<br />\nMight I suggest to Mssrs.<br />\nChromiak et. al. that all team<br />\nsports are simulated warfare.

Markups were still<br />\non his mind. He mentioned the<br />\nphilosophy meetings that are held<br />\nweekend the staff would be got at<br />\na friend's house for a further<br />\ndiscussion of the collective's<br />\nphilosophy (How much do we<br />\ncharge?). Stone Soup is non-profit.<br />\nNobody figures to earn more than<br />\nfifty cents an hour, a hundred<br />\ndollars a month, and that's only<br />\nfor those few who wofor those few<br />\nwho work full time. That was fine<br />\nby Kevin. But some people have<br />\nkids to worry about. As we walked<br />\nout the back of Stone Soup<br />\ntowards Old York Road, Kevin<br />\nexpressed a concern over this<br />\ndifference in personal needs, and<br />\nthe necessity of reconciling those<br />\ndifferences in a common<br />\nphilosophy. \"Operating a collective<br />\nis difficult,\" he explained, \"but<br />\nwe've been at it since<br />\nmin-November, and things are<br />\ngoing smoother every day.\"<br />\nThe garden used by Stone Soup<br />\nis on a neighbor's property.

Opening<br />\ntheir season at home, the Jays<br />\ndefeated visiting Gettysburg<br />\nCollege 8-6.<br />\nPhil Burlington started for<br />\nHopkins hurling the first six<br />\ninnings allowing three Of<br />\nGettysburg's six runs, only two<br />\nof which were earned in picking<br />\nup the victory.<br />\nHopkins jumped on top early<br />\npicking up two runs in the first<br />\ninning. The Jays added four more<br />\ntallies in the firth. Larry<br />\nSantoro's bases loaded single in<br />\nthe sixth proved to be the<br />\nwinning hit as he drowe in two<br />\nruns. Dave Emala had a fine<br />\nopening day showing driving in 3<br />\nComing on to relieve<br />\nBurlington in the seventh, Ed<br />\nChory breezed through the<br />\nseventh and eighth before<br />\nYielding three runs on four<br />\nsingles. Bill Jones was called on<br />\nto strike out the final. man with<br />\ntying run at the plate.<br />\nMAC<br />\nThe next Hopkins opponent<br />\nwas Haverford College in their<br />\nfirst MAC game of the year.<br />\nHopkins blew Haverford off to<br />\na 9-1 win. Bill Jones started and<br />\npitched a complete game giving<br />\nup a lone run on six hits, striking<br />\nout ten and walking five. Jones'<br />\nexcellent pitching was matched<br />\nby a balanced hitting attack by<br />\nthe Jays with Lou Podrazik and<br />\nJim Duffy highlighting with one<br />\nhome un apiece.<br />\nHopkins then embarked on a<br />\n<br />\nSouthern roadtrip over Easter<br />\nvacation facing four opponents in<br />\na single week. The Jays dropped<br />\nall four games.<br />\nFirst they faced Guilford<br />\nCollege in their first of two<br />\ngames against them. Hopkins lost<br />\nboth by the scores of 7-4 and<br />\n6-0. In the first game, Hopkins<br />\nblew a 4-0 lead. After starter<br />\nBurlington pitched shut out ball<br />\nhis first six innings, he gave up<br />\ntwo in the seventh and was<br />\nyanked by Cox in the ninth after<br />\nputting two men on base. Jason<br />\nSussman came on to get the first<br />\nout but yielded a walk to load<br />\nthe bases. Cox pulled Sussman<br />\nfor Chory to face a lefty batter.<br />\nThe strategy failed as Chory gave<br />\nup a two run single and a three<br />\nrun homer, Hopkins threatened<br />\nin the ninth but couldn't score.<br />\nHamstring<br />\nIn the second game, the Jays<br />\nwere without the services of Bob<br />\nBabb, their leading hitter, who<br />\npulled a hamstring. This forced<br />\nthe Jays to reshuffle their infield<br />\nwhich was to yield five big errors<br />\naccounting for five of Guilford's<br />\nsix runs. Bill Jones was the loser<br />\nin the 6-0 defeat.<br />\nThe infield miscues continued<br />\nfor Hopkins easy dropped an 8-2<br />\ndecision to Hamilton College of<br />\nNew York. Five errors helped<br />\nHamilton score seven unearned<br />\nruns.<br />\nIn their final roadtrip contest,<br />\nthe Jays were defeated by<br />\nCatawba College 11-3. Ed Chory<br />\nstarted the game but did not have<br />\nhis good control giving up ten<br />\nruns, eight earned on eleven hits<br />\nand five walks in his four inning<br />\n<br />\nstint.<br />\nAfter the Southern drought,<br />\nHopkins came home to face<br />\nSwarthmore College in their<br />\nsecond conference game. In<br />\nfreezing cold weather, the Jays<br />\npicked up their second<br />\nconference victory in a successful<br />\n5-2 effort.<br />\n<br />\nnewcomers to the team,<br />\naugmenting the presence of Joe<br />\n\"Flying Stick\" Devlin and<br />\nDoober Aburn who had already<br />\nplayed several games with the JV.<br />\nAll are freshmen and will<br />\ncontinue to play games with the<br />\nteam to gain experience.<br />\nAll five were a true asset to the<br />\nteam, especially Aburn, Devlin<br />\nand DeDomenico. Devlin lead the<br />\nteam in scoring with three goals,<br />\nwhile Aburn and DeDomenico<br />\neach had two. Aburn proved the<br />\noffensive leader of the game with<br />\nfour assists.<br />\nAt best, however, the varsity<br />\naddition is only a partial<br />\nexplanation. The JV regulars all<br />\nshowed fine efforts. Middie Dean<br />\n\"the dream\" Willis looked<br />\nparticularly good as he uncorked<br />\na 'powerful crankshot for two<br />\ngoals and won six faceoffs.<br />\nJunior Tom Cirillo made his JV<br />\ndebut playing attack and scored<br />\ntwo goals.

Goalie Jay \"Bird\"<br />\nTrainor stood out with ten saves<br />\nwhile defensemen Pete England,<br />\n<br />\nhome on a pass ball for the<br />\nwinning run. The Jays added two<br />\ninsurance runs in the seventh. In their most recent outing,<br />\nHopkins lost a squeaker to<br />\nMoravia College 6-5. Billy Jones<br />\nwas the loser. Bob.

In fact,<br />\naside from one series in which<br />\nDelaware was able to score, the<br />\nwhole first quarter was spent in<br />\nthe Delaware goal area.

However, as<br />\ntuition and other fees steadily<br />\nincrease, the middle income<br />\nstudent must be included in<br />\nfinancial aid eligibility, though<br />\nexisting assistance programs<br />\ncannot provide adequate aid' .to<br />\nthe middle income sector.<br />\n\"The middle income is the one<br />\nbracket that is squeezed out.\"<br />\nobserved Larry Denton, Director<br />\nof Academic Services. This<br />\nproblem is a serious one, since<br />\nmiddle income students comprise<br />\na sizeable portion of private<br />\nuniversity enrollments. At<br />\nIlopkins, roughly 70 per cent of<br />\nthe undergraduate student body<br />\nfalls into this category, by<br />\nDenton's estimate.<br />\n\"In the sixties,\" explained<br />\nDenton, \"the price of a college<br />\neducation was ..it too much for<br />\nthose in the middle income<br />\nbracket.\" The increasing costs\" of<br />\nprivate education, though, have<br />\nimposed a strain on the middle<br />\nincome family which must be<br />\nacknowledged in the needs<br />\nanalysis process.<br />\nThough standards for financial<br />\naid eligibility have been<br />\nexpanded in an effort to include<br />\nthe middle income group, funds<br />\n<br />\nfrom the federal government and<br />\nother sources have not been<br />\nincreased enough to provide<br />\nadequate-aid to this group:<br />\nWhat is needed to make the<br />\nallocation of aid more complete<br />\nis \"a massive infusion of money,\"<br />\nobserved Erik Molander,<br />\nchairman of the Student<br />\nCouncil's Financial Aid<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n\"Needs analysis has been<br />\nredone and made more sensitive<br />\nto the middle income needs,\" he<br />\nstated, \"but there still isn't<br />\nenough funding to allocate aid to<br />\nmeet this need.\"<br />\nSince the middle income<br />\nstudent is Hopkins' \"bread and<br />\nbutter student\" in Denton's<br />\nwords, Hopkins administrators<br />\nhave begun to investigate<br />\nmethods of increasing aid to the<br />\nmiddle income sector.<br />\nDenton contends that a merit<br />\nscholarship program, presently<br />\nunder' consideration by ' the<br />\nCommittee on Admissions and<br />\nAcademic Services, would help.<br />\n\"We have programs for lower<br />\nincome students, but nothing of<br />\nreal value to the middle income<br />\ngroup. I think that a merit<br />\nscholarships program could fill<br />\nthis need.\"<br />\nMolander contends, though,<br />\nthat merit scholarships would not<br />\nbe a viable solution to the<br />\nproblem. \"Today, that just isn't a<br />\nrational solution. People won't<br />\nbe receptive to the 'idea of just<br />\nhanding out money.\"<br />\nDenton and Molander agree<br />\n<br />\nthat the largest problem is a<br />\nsimple lack of funds to be<br />\nallocated in accordance with the<br />\nneeds analysis. The new, more<br />\nliberal needs analysis, though<br />\nmore equitable and more<br />\nsensitive to the middle income<br />\ngroup, has increased the total<br />\namount of need far beyond that<br />\nwhich can be met in the current<br />\nfinancial aid structure.<br />\n\"The new analysis is better,\"<br />\nstated Molander, \"but it just<br />\nincreased the amount of need.\"<br />\nHe said that, as a result, the<br />\nallocation of need becomes<br />\n\"relative deprivation,\" since<br />\nstudent in both the lower and<br />\nmiddle income groups cannot<br />\nreceive allocations equal to their<br />\nanalyzed need. \"There just isn't<br />\nenough money,\" observed<br />\nMolander.<br />\nUnless the financial aid<br />\nstructure is made more sensitive,<br />\nespecially with regard to federal<br />\nfunding, Molander predicts that<br />\nprivate education \"may cease to<br />\nbe a viable idea\u2014people are<br />\nalready having to go to sta.te<br />\nschools.\"<br />\nMolander said he feels Hopkins<br />\nshould increase its loan program,<br />\npetition for better federal<br />\nfunding, and consider emergency<br />\nmeasures which have been taken<br />\nat other schools.<br />\nYale University has enacted a<br />\ntuition payment option, whereby<br />\nstudents may elect either to pay<br />\ntuition with financial aid or pay<br />\nno tuition and agree to forward<br />\n.025 per cent of their income to<br />\n<br />\nLarry<br />\nYale for the rest of their lives.<br />\nAlso, at Beloit College a<br />\nsliding tuition program has been<br />\ninstituted which requires<br />\nstudents to pay as much tuition<br />\nas they can afford according to<br />\ntheir needs analysis. Molander<br />\nasserted that Beloit is dissatisfied<br />\nwith the program though, and<br />\nmay discontinue it.<br />\nHopkins may be forced to<br />\nconsider taking its own measures<br />\nto help out the middle income<br />\nbracket. Statistics compiled by<br />\nthe Admissions Council show<br />\nthat 21 per cent of those<br />\nstudents who turned down<br />\nHopkins' offer of acceptance did<br />\nso for financial reason . \"Most<br />\nof them end up going to state<br />\nschools,\" stated Molander.<br />\nC.

Approximately 30% of the students polled admit to some form of cheating.<br />\n2. The students polled estimated that about 30% of Hopkins\u2022students cheat.<br />\n3.

Moreover, the extension<br />\nfor certain classes, such as freshman Chem last year, so that<br />\nstudents can see their midterms before deciding whtther or<br />\nnot to drop a course, indicates that the administration has<br />\nfound a later drop date to be beneficial to students, at least<br />\nin some respects.<br />\nDierman's argument for moving back the add-drop date is<br />\na woefully unconvincing one, motivated by a concern for<br />\nclerical convenience rather than what students have felt and<br />\ncontinue to .feel is in their best interest.

When I first came to<br />\nthis University, I didn't expect to<br />\nfind too much attached to the<br />\nstigma of being a Johns Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate and I was right. The<br />\ncafeteria was typical, student<br />\nfacilities adaquate, courses-well, as<br />\nwith anything else, you learn to<br />\ntake the good with the bad. But<br />\none thing I did expect to be of<br />\nperhaps higher caliber was the<br />\ninfirmary service. Subsequent<br />\nexperiences, however, have proved<br />\nmy expectations were a bit too<br />\nhigh.<br />\nThe first time I had the<br />\nopportunity to take advantage of<br />\nthe infirmary's service was in<br />\nSeptember. I remember walking<br />\n'Axe.<br /><br />\nare concerned. I suggest a thorough<br />\nevaluation of these. Not only is it<br />\nhypocritical, but also embarassing<br />\nthat at a university which owes so<br />\nmuch to the extensive reputation it<br />\nhas retained in the field of<br />\nmedicine, its undergraduates<br />\nshould be rediced to wandering<br />\naround campus querying \"Is there<br />\na doctor in this house?\"<br />\nMichele Davis<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would just like to thank the<br />\nNews-Utter for giving credit where<br />\ncredit is due and besides I wrote a<br />\ngreat housing report.<br />\nMike Lenardo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI wish to congratulate The<br />\nCc,<br /><br />\nQ.CNC<br /><br />\n$<br /><br />\ndesk and was told to be seated.<br />\nFive minutes later I was called in<br />\nto be examined. The nurse was<br />\nkindly--took my temperature-even<br />\nchecked my pulse. She gave me a<br />\nvariety of medicines and told me<br />\nto check back in a few weeks if I<br />\nwasn't feeling any better. In a<br />\nhoarse whisper I gave my thanks<br />\nand left. Two weeks later, I was<br />\nback. This time I received a new<br />\nvariety of pills and a large can of<br />\napple juice, A &amp; P Brand, which I<br />\nwas told to drink as soon as<br />\npossible. I complied.<br />\nThat weekend will no be quickly<br />\nforgotten. Sure that I would never<br />\nlive to see another Monday, I<br />\ndirected my roommate to call the<br />\nnurse on duty. She did so and told<br />\nher of my dire condition. The<br />\nnurse laughed, told me not to eat<br />\nfor a few days and I would feel<br />\nbetter.<br />\nWell, luckily, someone took<br />\npity. In the months that followed,<br />\nI had my bouts with various things<br />\nbut none -that took me to those<br />\ndreaded infirmary steps.<br />\nUnfortunately, though, I was not<br />\nto escape entirely.

I went<br />\nto the nurse and as she shoved a<br />\nthermometer in my mouth, she<br />\ntold me of the history of viruses<br />\nand of the value of drinking eight<br />\nglasses of water a day. Five days in<br />\nbed convinced me that eight glasses<br />\nof water were just not enough but<br />\nI seemed to be doing better and<br />\nluckily in a few days I would be<br />\ngoing home.<br />\nAt home I ckecked with my<br />\ndoctor who told me that I had<br />\nbeen very ill and asked me why I<br />\nhadn't had a throat culture or a<br />\nblood test taken. I shrugged<br />\nignorantly-afterall I wasn't even a<br />\npre-med. When I told him that I<br />\nwent to Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nhe guffawed and commented that<br />\nit seemed odd to him that with all<br />\nthe great practitioners there, they<br />\ncouldn't even diagnose a simple flu<br />\nor virus correctly. When asked if I<br />\nhad been to see a doctor, I<br />\nshrugged again and told him that<br />\nonly if you were dying of infection<br />\nwould a doctor examine<br />\nyou-otherwise you were at the<br />\nmercy of the nurses.<br />\nThe moral or conclusion of this<br />\nstory is that, based on personal<br />\nexperience and those recounted to<br />\nme, it would seem that this<br />\nuniversity has been negligent as far<br />\nas undergraduate health facilities<br /><br />\ne<br />\nII7<br /><br />\n2,As1c<br /><br />\nav\u2018.<br /><br />\nore's two ''major\"<br />\nnewspapers.

How much could Mr.<br />\nChromiak, know about LaCrosse<br />\nor any other contact sport when he<br />\nwrites that an athlete should not<br />\nplay in a game if he is planning on<br />\npurposely hurting another. He<br />\nwent on to say that hurting<br />\nanother player is in \"flagrant<br />\nviolation of the idea of sports.\"<br />\nWhat is it that he would suggest<br />\nMuhammad Ali do in the<br />\nring-dance the night away? Or<br />\nthat the ,Black Hawks perfect their<br />\nfigure skating techniques?<br />\nIt so happens that in LaCrosse<br />\nand many other contact sports the<br />\nplayers are trained in hitting skills.<br />\nAt the risk of sounding<br />\nhypocritical I would venture to say<br />\nthat these players are aware of the<br />\nfact that they may be injured at<br />\nany time during a game. The<br />\nofficials have not defined \"brutal,\"<br />\nthey have defined legal and illegal<br />\nhits however.

That was fine<br />\nby Kevin. But some people have<br />\nkids to worry about. As we walked<br />\nout the back of Stone Soup<br />\ntowards Old York Road, Kevin<br />\nexpressed a concern over this<br />\ndifference in personal needs, and<br />\nthe necessity of reconciling those<br />\ndifferences in a common<br />\nphilosophy. \"Operating a collective<br />\nis difficult,\" he explained, \"but<br />\nwe've been at it since<br />\nmin-November, and things are<br />\ngoing smoother every day.\"<br />\nThe garden used by Stone Soup<br />\nis on a neighbor's property.

The Jays added four more<br />\ntallies in the firth. Larry<br />\nSantoro's bases loaded single in<br />\nthe sixth proved to be the<br />\nwinning hit as he drowe in two<br />\nruns. Dave Emala had a fine<br />\nopening day showing driving in 3<br />\nComing on to relieve<br />\nBurlington in the seventh, Ed<br />\nChory breezed through the<br />\nseventh and eighth before<br />\nYielding three runs on four<br />\nsingles.

Bill Jones started and<br />\npitched a complete game giving<br />\nup a lone run on six hits, striking<br />\nout ten and walking five. Jones'<br />\nexcellent pitching was matched<br />\nby a balanced hitting attack by<br />\nthe Jays with Lou Podrazik and<br />\nJim Duffy highlighting with one<br />\nhome un apiece.<br />\nHopkins then embarked on a<br /><br />\nSouthern roadtrip over Easter<br />\nvacation facing four opponents in<br />\na single week. The Jays dropped<br />\nall four games.<br />\nFirst they faced Guilford<br />\nCollege in their first of two<br />\ngames against them. Hopkins lost<br />\nboth by the scores of 7-4 and<br />\n6-0. In the first game, Hopkins<br />\nblew a 4-0 lead. After starter<br />\nBurlington pitched shut out ball<br />\nhis first six innings, he gave up<br />\ntwo in the seventh and was<br />\nyanked by Cox in the ninth after<br />\nputting two men on base. Jason<br />\nSussman came on to get the first<br />\nout but yielded a walk to load<br />\nthe bases. Cox pulled Sussman<br />\nfor Chory to face a lefty batter.<br />\nThe strategy failed as Chory gave<br />\nup a two run single and a three<br />\nrun homer, Hopkins threatened<br />\nin the ninth but couldn't score.<br />\nHamstring<br />\nIn the second game, the Jays<br />\nwere without the services of Bob<br />\nBabb, their leading hitter, who<br />\npulled a hamstring. This forced<br />\nthe Jays to reshuffle their infield<br />\nwhich was to yield five big errors<br />\naccounting for five of Guilford's<br />\nsix runs.

However, as<br />\ntuition and other fees steadily<br />\nincrease, the middle income<br />\nstudent must be included in<br />\nfinancial aid eligibility, though<br />\nexisting assistance programs<br />\ncannot provide adequate aid' .to<br />\nthe middle income sector.<br />\n\"The middle income is the one<br />\nbracket that is squeezed out.\"<br />\nobserved Larry Denton, Director<br />\nof Academic Services. This<br />\nproblem is a serious one, since<br />\nmiddle income students comprise<br />\na sizeable portion of private<br />\nuniversity enrollments. At<br />\nIlopkins, roughly 70 per cent of<br />\nthe undergraduate student body<br />\nfalls into this category, by<br />\nDenton's estimate.<br />\n\"In the sixties,\" explained<br />\nDenton, \"the price of a college<br />\neducation was ..it too much for<br />\nthose in the middle income<br />\nbracket.\" The increasing costs\" of<br />\nprivate education, though, have<br />\nimposed a strain on the middle<br />\nincome family which must be<br />\nacknowledged in the needs<br />\nanalysis process.<br />\nThough standards for financial<br />\naid eligibility have been<br />\nexpanded in an effort to include<br />\nthe middle income group, funds<br /><br />\nfrom the federal government and<br />\nother sources have not been<br />\nincreased enough to provide<br />\nadequate-aid to this group:<br />\nWhat is needed to make the<br />\nallocation of aid more complete<br />\nis \"a massive infusion of money,\"<br />\nobserved Erik Molander,<br />\nchairman of the Student<br />\nCouncil's Financial Aid<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n\"Needs analysis has been<br />\nredone and made more sensitive<br />\nto the middle income needs,\" he<br />\nstated, \"but there still isn't<br />\nenough funding to allocate aid to<br />\nmeet this need.\"<br />\nSince the middle income<br />\nstudent is Hopkins' \"bread and<br />\nbutter student\" in Denton's<br />\nwords, Hopkins administrators<br />\nhave begun to investigate<br />\nmethods of increasing aid to the<br />\nmiddle income sector.<br />\nDenton contends that a merit<br />\nscholarship program, presently<br />\nunder' consideration by ' the<br />\nCommittee on Admissions and<br />\nAcademic Services, would help.<br />\n\"We have programs for lower<br />\nincome students, but nothing of<br />\nreal value to the middle income<br />\ngroup. I think that a merit<br />\nscholarships program could fill<br />\nthis need.\"<br />\nMolander contends, though,<br />\nthat merit scholarships would not<br />\nbe a viable solution to the<br />\nproblem. \"Today, that just isn't a<br />\nrational solution. People won't<br />\nbe receptive to the 'idea of just<br />\nhanding out money.\"<br />\nDenton and Molander agree<br /><br />\nthat the largest problem is a<br />\nsimple lack of funds to be<br />\nallocated in accordance with the<br />\nneeds analysis. The new, more<br />\nliberal needs analysis, though<br />\nmore equitable and more<br />\nsensitive to the middle income<br />\ngroup, has increased the total<br />\namount of need far beyond that<br />\nwhich can be met in the current<br />\nfinancial aid structure.<br />\n\"The new analysis is better,\"<br />\nstated Molander, \"but it just<br />\nincreased the amount of need.\"<br />\nHe said that, as a result, the<br />\nallocation of need becomes<br />\n\"relative deprivation,\" since<br />\nstudent in both the lower and<br />\nmiddle income groups cannot<br />\nreceive allocations equal to their<br />\nanalyzed need. \"There just isn't<br />\nenough money,\" observed<br />\nMolander.<br />\nUnless the financial aid<br />\nstructure is made more sensitive,<br />\nespecially with regard to federal<br />\nfunding, Molander predicts that<br />\nprivate education \"may cease to<br />\nbe a viable idea\u2014people are<br />\nalready having to go to sta.te<br />\nschools.\"<br />\nMolander said he feels Hopkins<br />\nshould increase its loan program,<br />\npetition for better federal<br />\nfunding, and consider emergency<br />\nmeasures which have been taken<br />\nat other schools.<br />\nYale University has enacted a<br />\ntuition payment option, whereby<br />\nstudents may elect either to pay<br />\ntuition with financial aid or pay<br />\nno tuition and agree to forward<br />\n.025 per cent of their income to<br /><br />\nLarry<br />\nYale for the rest of their lives.<br />\nAlso, at Beloit College a<br />\nsliding tuition program has been<br />\ninstituted which requires<br />\nstudents to pay as much tuition<br />\nas they can afford according to<br />\ntheir needs analysis. Molander<br />\nasserted that Beloit is dissatisfied<br />\nwith the program though, and<br />\nmay discontinue it.<br />\nHopkins may be forced to<br />\nconsider taking its own measures<br />\nto help out the middle income<br />\nbracket. Statistics compiled by<br />\nthe Admissions Council show<br />\nthat 21 per cent of those<br />\nstudents who turned down<br />\nHopkins' offer of acceptance did<br />\nso for financial reason . \"Most<br />\nof them end up going to state<br />\nschools,\" stated Molander.<br />\nC.
