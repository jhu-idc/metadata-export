Despite<br />\nthese bad omens, however, the outlook for the new year is<br />\nfairly bright.<br />\nPerhaps the best prospect for '53 is the soccer team, which<br />\nat the present time is receiving the accolades of a majority of<br />\ncoaches and soccer officials in the east. In his first year as soccer<br />\ncoach at Hopkins Wilson Fewster gave the Jay hooters their first<br />\nwinning season in five _years, and but for an injury to Jerry<br />\nStrauss the team might have gone undefeated.<br />\nHis job next fall promises to be a rough one, since he will lose<br />\nfour starters through graduation. The greatest of these losses will<br />\nbe Buzzie Budnitz, who was recently selected to the southern<br />\ndivision All Star team. Training a man to fill his shoes will be<br />\nquite a task, but Fewster who filled the biggest hole on the '52<br />\nlineup, the goal, will probably come up with some solution.<br />\nThe job which Fewster did with Dave Rack is really a most<br />\namazing one.

Despite<br />\nthese bad omens, however, the outlook for the new year is<br />\nfairly bright.<br />\nPerhaps the best prospect for '53 is the soccer team, which<br />\nat the present time is receiving the accolades of a majority of<br />\ncoaches and soccer officials in the east. In his first year as soccer<br />\ncoach at Hopkins Wilson Fewster gave the Jay hooters their first<br />\nwinning season in five _years, and but for an injury to Jerry<br />\nStrauss the team might have gone undefeated.<br />\nHis job next fall promises to be a rough one, since he will lose<br />\nfour starters through graduation. The greatest of these losses will<br />\nbe Buzzie Budnitz, who was recently selected to the southern<br />\ndivision All Star team. Training a man to fill his shoes will be<br />\nquite a task, but Fewster who filled the biggest hole on the '52<br />\nlineup, the goal, will probably come up with some solution.<br />\nThe job which Fewster did with Dave Rack is really a most<br />\namazing one.
