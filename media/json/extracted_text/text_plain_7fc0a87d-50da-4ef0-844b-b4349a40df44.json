Christie and<br />\nKowenhoven, and including the<br />\nSenior Mechanical and Electrical<br />\nand the Junior Civil Engineering<br />\nstudents, made an inspection tour<br />\nto the Locke Insulator Works in<br />\nSouth Baltimore.<br />\nAbout forty men made up the<br />\nparty. The visit was very interesting and also very instructive from<br />\nan engineering viewpoint. Some of<br />\nthe engineers at the plant acted as<br />\nguides and explained in an interesting manner different processes<br />\ninvolved in making insulator<br />\npieces, from the preliminary grinding and mixing of the clays to the<br />\nfinal glazing and testing of the finished product. They explained the<br />\nproportioning of the different clays,<br />\nfelspar and flint; the mixing, grinding and watering; the removal of<br />\norganic matter by means of sieves<br />\ncalled \"lawns\"; the removal of water by filter presses; the pug mill<br />\nprocess to make the clay homogeneous and to get rid of laminations; the molding in plaster of<br />\nparis molds; the threading of the<br />\ninsulators while still plastic; the air<br />\ndrying process; the humidity drier<br />\nwhich takes about three days; the<br />\nburning of the product in the kilns;<br />\nthe glazing of the insulators; the<br />\ntesting process, in which the insulators are subjected to 90,000<br />\nvolts, the cracking of which would<br />\nremind a soldier of rapid fire on<br />\nthe rifle range; and lastly, the packing and shipping of the final product. A similar inspection tour will<br />\nbe made to the Sparrows Point<br />\nSteel Works some time after the<br />\nmid-year examinations.<br />\n<br />\nTWENTY-NINE MEDS<br />\nHONORED<br />\nTwenty-nine of the ninety-four<br />\nmembers of this year's graduating<br />\nclass of the Medical School have<br />\nbeen awarded the highest honor<br />\nwhich can fall to the lot of a graduate.

The visit was very interesting and also very instructive from<br />\nan engineering viewpoint. Some of<br />\nthe engineers at the plant acted as<br />\nguides and explained in an interesting manner different processes<br />\ninvolved in making insulator<br />\npieces, from the preliminary grinding and mixing of the clays to the<br />\nfinal glazing and testing of the finished product. They explained the<br />\nproportioning of the different clays,<br />\nfelspar and flint; the mixing, grinding and watering; the removal of<br />\norganic matter by means of sieves<br />\ncalled \"lawns\"; the removal of water by filter presses; the pug mill<br />\nprocess to make the clay homogeneous and to get rid of laminations; the molding in plaster of<br />\nparis molds; the threading of the<br />\ninsulators while still plastic; the air<br />\ndrying process; the humidity drier<br />\nwhich takes about three days; the<br />\nburning of the product in the kilns;<br />\nthe glazing of the insulators; the<br />\ntesting process, in which the insulators are subjected to 90,000<br />\nvolts, the cracking of which would<br />\nremind a soldier of rapid fire on<br />\nthe rifle range; and lastly, the packing and shipping of the final product. A similar inspection tour will<br />\nbe made to the Sparrows Point<br />\nSteel Works some time after the<br />\nmid-year examinations.<br /><br />\nTWENTY-NINE MEDS<br />\nHONORED<br />\nTwenty-nine of the ninety-four<br />\nmembers of this year's graduating<br />\nclass of the Medical School have<br />\nbeen awarded the highest honor<br />\nwhich can fall to the lot of a graduate.
