The<br />\nlocal musical season is thus underway.<br />\nBut this is more than just the beginning of a<br />\nnew season for the orcheitra.

At that time it was merely a<br />\nsrnall civic group, playing about six concerts a<br />\nyear.

The program was highlighted<br />\nwith a richly-interpreted performance of the<br />\nBrahms' First Symphony and, with Rudolf<br />\nSerkin as guest piano soloist, the romantic Concerto in A-minor by Robert Schumann. The<br />\nlocal musical season is thus underway.<br />\nBut this is more than just the beginning of a<br />\nnew season for the orcheitra. This -is, in the<br />\nwords of Conductor Reginald Stewart, the<br />\n\"beginning of a new era, which will see music in<br />\nBaltimore going on -to greater and greater triumphs.\" Mr. Stewart was referring to the new organization of the orchestra's Board of Directors,<br />\ncompletely revised since last year, and starting<br />\noff (for the first time in many years) in a completely sound financial condition.<br />\nMUSICIANS<br />\nThe musicians who last year had to play only<br />\nfrom concert-to concert as funds came in for the<br />\nseason to continue, are thus assured of being able<br />\nto complete the full program outlined for this<br />\nwinter. This program is exttnsive, consisting of<br />\ntwelve mid-week concerts, featuring many important S-oloists; ten Sunday night concerts,Popularly priced (tickets sell for as-low as twenty-five<br />\ncents);two extensive out-of-town tours, including<br />\na performance in New York's Carnegie Hall; a<br />\nseries of radio presentations; and Young People's<br />\nconcerts, performed in the various public highschools of Baltimore.<br />\nThis schedule is'an ambitious one, and represents huge strides forward since the\u2022time, seven<br />\nYears ago, when Mr. Stewart took over direction<br />\nof the orchestra. At that time it was merely a<br />\nsrnall civic group, playing about six concerts a<br />\nyear. The new conductor, who also is Director of<br />\nthe 'Peabody Conservatory of Music, has been<br />\nable to attract outstanding musicians to Baltimore both as members.of the permanent group<br />\nand as guest soloists; and the orchestra is now<br />\nrecognized as being on a par with those of Cleveland, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.<br />\nOf course, in common with those others, it can' 1t\u2022 t\u2022<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\nit<br /><br />\nOrchestras, both of which have yearly budgets of<br />\nover a million dollars, several times the budget<br />\nof the entire musical program for Baltimore City.<br />\nMr. Stewart feels very deeply the value of<br />\nmusic as an enriching element in modern life.<br />\nXilvw Shorrs ate aid\";neeeike<br /><br />\neajet-some!'shepixie,<br />\nYour favorite<br />\noxford#1,aton-down<br /><br />\n,o7 hic #i<br />\nXimsmee,<br /><br />\n.s/de/' No chafing<br />\ncenter sewn<br /><br />\nif you have a deep seated conviction that something is<br />\ncreeping up on you, your trouble is ill-fitting shorts,.<br />\nFor real comfort below decks, see your Arrow dealer for<br />\nArrow shorts and you'll have the best seat in the house!<br /><br />\n$1.23 up<br /><br />\n\u201eARROW SHIRTS<br />\nTIES \u2022 UNDERWEAR \u2022 HANDKERCHIEFS \u2022 SPORTS SHIRTS<br /><br />\nARROW<br />\nSHIRTS<br />\nSome like /'em white,<br />\nSome like 'em blue\u2014<br />\nK.

This space<br />\nwas called the \"orchestra,\" and would correspond to the orchestra pit in the modern theater.<br />\nEarly in the 19th century it became customary<br />\nto refer to the group of musicians who occupied<br />\nthis space, rather than to the space itself, as<br />\n\"the orchestra.\"<br />\nGroup music was first used almost exclusively<br />\nas support for vocal music, and it was not until<br />\nthe time of Bach arid Haydn (17th century) that<br />\ncomposers began writing for instruments alone.<br /><br />\nREGINALD STEWART<br />\nWell qualified as the orehestral conductor and<br />\ninterpreter.
