Williams, Ogden and<br />\nAbercrombie, are L oncerned, and<br />\nmany were the expressions of appreciation and pleasure heard from<br />\nthe nearly two hundred alumni and<br />\ntheir guests assembled together on<br />\nthat delightful occasion.<br />\nBut in the spirit of fellowship<br />\nmanifested and engendered and in<br />\nthe feeling of enthusiasm created by<br />\nthe eloquent addresses, the banquet<br />\nof 1910 will always live among those<br />\nfortunate enough to be present. How<br />\none feels the inspiration of association, at a gattiering like this! How<br />\nforcibly .do such reunions impress up'On one the inestimable value of daily<br />\nintercourse among the students, the<br />\nliving together within the same<br />\nWalls, the sleeping under the same<br />\nroofs! Only under such conditions<br />\nWith such relations of daily life can<br />\nthe influence of our Alma Mater be<br />\nforcibly realized; and for the accomplishment of this end we have<br />\nThat<br />\nbut one goal\u2014Homewood.<br />\nUniversity<br />\nthe<br />\nthe establishment of<br />\nUpon this beautiful site is essential<br />\nznd vital to its welfare is undisputed. Some additional funds will be<br />\nnecessary actually to move, but this<br />\ntask accomplished and the University once there, Johns Hopkins will<br />\nbe the recipient of ample endowments, ever increasing in number,<br />\nWith which to pursue her splendid<br />\nWork in the field of education.<br />\nMany distinguished guests honored the alumni by their presence.<br />\nAmong them were, his Excellency,<br />\nthe German Ambassador, Count<br />\nBernstoff, and Dr. Robert Falconer,<br />\nPresident of Toronto University,the<br />\nnrasor of the day at the morning exercises in McCoy Hall. His Excellency in his admirable address dwelt<br />\nO n the feeling of good fellowship and<br />\nfriendly relations existing between<br />\nthe German Empire aryl this country,<br />\nexpressed the belief that the intercourse between the scientists and the<br />\nscholars of the Universities of the<br />\ntwo countries, Germany and the<br />\nPnited States, were potent factors<br />\nIn arousing and cementing such<br />\nfeelings of good will. He spoke<br />\nthe value<br />\nemphasis of<br />\nWith<br />\ncountry<br />\na<br />\nto<br />\nuniversity<br />\na<br />\nof<br />\nand pointed out how his government<br />\nturned to the different professors in<br />\nthe various German universities for<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, Md., March 7, 1910.<br />\nthe solution of many problems and<br />\nfor settlement of the disturbing<br />\nquestions of the day. The address<br />\nof Count Bernstoff was eloquently<br />\nexpressed and was greeted with<br />\nhearty applause.<br />\nFew speakers have made a more<br />\nfavorable impression at any of the<br />\nCommemoration exercises than did<br />\nPresident Falconer. Manly and dignified in bearing, clear cut and forcible in speech, and fluent in diction,<br />\nhe went straight to the hearts of his<br />\nlisteners. As by its fruit shall you<br />\nknow the tree, so by its alumni shall<br />\nyou guage the true calibre of a<br />\nuniversity. Truth, great abiding<br />\ntruth is the aim, and to it, absolute<br />\nfidelity is due. Sincerity of mind,<br />\nand simplicity of mind must characterize the student. Attention to detail must be jealously guarded, care<br />\nmust be taken not to twist facts to<br />\nconform to theories, but to deduce<br />\ntheories from facts. Man can be of<br />\nservice when he has grasped some<br />\nThe Univerguiding principle.<br />\nisty offers fellowship with great<br />\nmen. True learning, with the conceptions of truth dominant will<br />\ngive a moral conception which will<br />\ngovern the world and the life and<br />\nspirit, so imbibed, will illumine and<br />\nenliven the civilization of the world.<br />\nSuch were some of the splendid<br />\nthoughts expressed by Dr. Falconer.<br />\nAmidst college yells, Dr. Remsen was then introduced. He spoke<br />\nof the value of academic freedom<br />\nand showed the tendency toward the<br />\napplication of the policy of protection, protection to \"infant industries,\" in the heavy endowment of<br />\ninstitutions of learning. He voiced<br />\na note of warning against the abuses<br />\nof endowment \u2014 the pauperizing of<br />\nthe student by excessive distribution<br />\nof fellowships and scholarships, the<br />\ndanger to the young investigator<br />\nfrom the foundation of institutes of<br />\nspecial research and investigation<br />\nwhich made no demands upon him<br />\nas a teacher and so deprived him of<br />\none of the most potent guides to<br />\nclarity of thought and largeness of<br />\nview, and an even greater danger in<br />\nthe demand of the community or the<br />\ngovernment for his services in connection with undertakings, official<br />\nand semi-official, that absorbed his<br />\ntime and his energies to the disadvantage of the institution where his<br />\nvocation lay.<br />\nCalls for (the) \"Keyser\" accompanied by an occasioned \"Hoch der<br />\nKaiser,\" were confusing to his Excellency, Count Bernstoff, until the<br />\npresident of the Board of Trustees<br />\nrose to make a few impromptu re-<br />\n<br />\nmarks. Mr. Keyser informed the<br />\nalumni that he greeted with earnest<br />\napproval the evidence shown by them<br />\nin their Alma Mater and in the efforts being made at the present time<br />\nby the Trustees to fulfill the conditions<br />\nimposed by the General Education<br />\nBoard upon their offer of $250,000<br />\nto the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThey looked to the Alumni to assist them in this undertaking and be<br />\nconsidered it their duty to do all in<br />\ntheir power to aid and benefit their<br />\nAlma Mater. To this end he extended a warm and cordial welcome<br />\nto the Alumni Council to co-operate<br />\nand to rouse others to co-operate in<br />\nthe great task.<br />\nDr. Elgin R. L. Gould, chairman<br />\nof the Committee on Endowment of<br />\nthe Alumni Council, and so representing that body on this occasion,<br />\nwas the next speaker, and he spoke<br />\nwith enthusiasm and effect from the<br />\nstandpoint of the alumni. He said<br />\nthat academic discussion of the best<br />\nmethods of raising funds was a futile waste of time, and that abstract<br />\npreparations for an endowment campaign should cease. Men are not<br />\npersuaded to give money by logical<br />\narguments carefully drawn up and<br />\nnicely expressed. They respond only to enthusiasm, to a spirit of emulation, and of friendly rivalry. Once<br />\nget men giving and others will give.<br />\nGet the ball started and it will continue to roll. For his part he stood<br />\nready to co-operate and to do his<br />\nbest to pay a share of the debt he<br />\nowed the University for what he had<br />\nreceived here as a graduate student<br />\nand as a holder of a fellowship. To<br />\ndo the work effectively, in his opinion, it was necessary to divide up<br />\nthe attacking forces, to \"differentiate\" the objects sought for, to separate into committees with some specific purpose before each of a nature to appeal to the individual approached. Let there be a \"Rowland<br />\nFund\" for the advancement of the<br />\nstudy of physics, a Gilman memorial<br />\nhousing those interests that Dr. Gilman had especially at heart, and other similar definite purposes for which<br />\nmoney is to be collected. As far as<br />\nhe was concerned a Gilman Fund<br />\nwould be that which he would specially like to raise. His advocacy<br />\nof this program aroused the interest<br />\nand approval of the Alumni who<br />\nshared his belief that with its adoption the work could be speedily and<br />\nsuccessfully accomplished.<br />\nLast came the representative of the<br />\nBachelors of Arts, Mr. Newton D.<br />\nBaker, City Solicitor of Cleveland,<br />\none of the earnest co-operators with<br />\n<br />\nPrice, 5 cents per copy.<br />\nMayor Tom Johnson and one of his<br />\nmost effective lieutenants. Mr. Baker spoke with all the zeal of a<br />\nspecial pleader, with great clearness<br />\nof voice and a ringing tone of conviction. He was puzzled, he said, to<br />\nnote how perplexing was the question of how to raise money for the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. In the<br />\nMiddle West financial support was<br />\nalways so spontaneously given, that<br />\nhe found it hard to appreciate the<br />\ndifficulties with which we seemed to<br />\nfind ourselves confronted. However,<br />\nin one instance he did recall that<br />\nthe bounty of a benefactor had a<br />\nstring attached to it\u2014$150,000 was<br />\noffered, provided $35o,000 was raised<br />\nby a certain time. The trustees<br />\nworked and worked, until on the afternoon of the fateful day, when the<br />\ntime expired for complying with the<br />\nconditions, they found themselves<br />\ntill short by $20,000 of the necessary amount. The institution to be<br />\nbenefited being theological in character, the trustees determined to have<br />\nrecourse to prayer. 'Twas 7 p.m.<br />\nThey prayed and prayed, until finally,<br />\nfive minutes before midnight, one<br />\nfrom their midst arose and said,<br />\n\"Brethren, our prayer is answered;<br />\nI will give it myself.\" Mr. Baker<br />\nspoke at length upon the social conditions existing in the Middle West,<br />\nwith an eloquence and understanding that held the attention of all<br />\npresent. He declared that that section of the country, freed somewhat<br />\ntoday from the thraldom of corrupt<br />\npolitical despotism, was now seething<br />\nwith socialistic doctrines and tendencies and that although much good<br />\nhad been accomplished in the placing of healthful restrictions around<br />\nthe employment of child labor, restrictions fundamental to the maintenance of a high standard of manhood in the country, and in the passing of other laws\u2014still, mere law<br />\nwas only a partial remedy, and the<br />\nonly salvation lay in raising the<br />\nstandard of men. Here was the opportunity and duty of the University. Turn out men that cannot<br />\nsteal and lie, men whose prejudices<br />\nare softened in the presence of higher knowledge and broader experience, men to whom the search for<br />\ntruth and belief in the truth are<br />\nhigher than the business of feathering the nest and lining the pocket.<br />\nLet the University, in the words of<br />\nCalvin, receive us as wood and return us to the world fashioned as<br />\narrows to pierce the fallacies that<br />\nare constantly menacing our personal and national welfare.<br />\nIt was a splendid reunion.

March 7, 1910.<br />\nSECOND<br />\n<br />\nMEDICAL REUNION<br />\n<br />\nLetters From Drs. Welch and<br />\nOsler.<br />\nThe following letter from Dr.<br />\nWelch has been received:<br />\n\"Our faculty and all interested in<br />\nthe future of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School must welcome cordially the proposal to form an association of our medical alumni. Such<br />\nan organization will be of great service to the school and think also of<br />\nbenefit to our graduates. It will enable us here to maintain closer relations with our graduates, it will<br />\ncultivate a spirit of loyalty, it will<br />\nafford opportunity for agreeable and<br />\nprofitable reunion here and elsewhere<br />\nin the country, and will strengthen<br />\nties of friendship and helpful relations. The Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool has been enabled to advance<br />\nthe cause of higher medical education and to establish standards which<br />\nare distinctive, and the reasons for<br />\nsuch an organization as that contemplated are perhaps even stronger<br />\nthan in the case of other medical<br />\nschools, which have profited so much<br />\nby similar alumni associations.<br />\nWith best wishes for the success<br />\nof the efforts of those engaged in<br />\nforming the organization and assurance of the heartiest co-operation on<br />\nthe part of all connected with the<br />\nschool, I am<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\nWilliam H. Welch.\"<br />\nDr. Osler says in lis letter to one<br />\nof the Council, \"It would help the<br />\nschool immensely to feel that the<br />\ngraduates were in close touch and<br />\ntheir advice should be sought in certain matters. A great many of them<br />\nare now in positions from which<br />\nthey recognize the lines of development along which a school like the<br />\nJohns Hopkins should take. A large<br />\ninfluental body of graduate opinion<br />\nkeeps faculty and trustees up to the<br />\nmark. Recent appointments indicate<br />\nthat the proper spirit is maintained,<br />\nbut institutions, like individuals, have<br />\ntheir periods of ill-health,when things<br />\ndo not go well and it is at just this<br />\nemergency that the graduate body is<br />\nmost helpful.\"<br />\nWe feel that all graduates of the<br />\nmedical school will follow the counsel of our distinguished teachers and<br />\ndo their utmost to make the organization of our alumni worthy of the<br />\nundergraduate school we represent.<br />\nPlans for the reunion are well under way. Whether or not it is desirable for the graduates of the<br />\nMedical School to form a permanent alumni organization is a question that ought to be considered<br />\ncarefully from the point of view of<br />\nthe Alumni Association as a whole.<br />\nCertainly no step will be taken that<br />\nis likely to prevent the Alumni Association from receiving the full<br />\nsupport of the Medical Alumni.<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS CLUB<br />\nFi on, the beginning of the University, there was felt the need of a social center which found expression<br />\nin various ways. The Club that used<br />\nto meet in Little Garden St., filled<br />\nthis want and, begun and continued<br />\nafter \u2022 a German model, satisfied the<br />\ncraving for companionship and intercourse which finally materialized<br />\nin the present University Club. As<br />\nthis enlarged its scope, however, it<br />\nlost its character as a Hopkins Institution, and the call for such an organization became more and more urgent. This was recognized in 1899,<br />\nwhen a circular letter was sent to<br />\n!hose interested in such a project<br />\nsuggesting the formation of an exclusively Hopkins Institution. This<br />\nappeal was signed by the following<br />\ngentlemen: J. S. Ames, R. Garret,<br />\nA. J. Shriver, W. Newcomer, J. H.<br />\nHollander, G. G. Morrison, V. A.<br />\nRenouf, and H. B. Adams. The response was immediate, and the present Johns<br />\nHopkins Club<br />\nwas<br />\nsuccessfully inaugurated. After some<br />\nyears of useful existence, there<br />\nwas a lapse of vitality and efficiency, which seemed to some<br />\nof the gentlemen interested to<br />\nbe caused by the lack of adequate<br />\naccommodation, and largely through<br />\nthe efforts of Mr. W. H. Buckler, one<br />\nof the trustees of the University, the<br />\nhouse at 227 W. Monument St., was<br />\npurchased, a home that was admirably fitted for the purpose in mind.<br />\nThis was in 1905, and since then,<br />\nthe Club has enjoyed a new era of<br />\nprosperity. Under the present direction it has broadened its outlook,<br />\nand enlarged its usefulness in many<br />\ndirections, keeping strictly, however,<br />\nwithin its lines as an exclusively University movement. In its present<br />\nform it responds to a distinct demand, and has taken a place in the<br />\nUniversity life held by no other of<br />\nthe University Clubs or Associations.<br />\nIt was felt that Hopkins men<br />\nshould have a rallying point after<br />\nimmediate<br />\nwith<br />\nconnection<br />\nthe University had ceased, that<br />\nthere should be a centre for the<br />\nalumni, where committees on business connected with the University<br />\ncould meet, where dinners and reunions could be given, where gradu-ite-students could find pleasant quarters, where alumni living at a distance could find pleasant accommoda'ions and friends when called to the<br />\ncity, rand this the Johns Hopkins<br />\nClub aims to furnish to its members.<br />\nAt present the Alumni Association<br />\nhas no quarters, and all records<br />\nchange hands .and home with the<br />\nchange of officers. It has been strongly recommended that it would be much<br />\nmore satisfactory for the Association<br />\nto take a suitable room at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club-house where all the<br />\nrecords should be kept permanently,<br />\nsuch as a card catalogue of the members of the Association at large, and<br />\nof all branch associations, the Hop1,7:ns publications, and other Univervi'y matter, of interest to the Alumni.<br />\nMoreover, as it does not seem possi-<br />\n<br />\nble at present for the Alumni Council to be provided with proper quarters in the University buildings, they<br />\ncould find a permanent Committeeroom in the Club-house which would<br />\nbe assured to them for their exclusive use, where meetings could be<br />\nheld and material kept safely, undisturbed by other possible occupants.<br />\nWith the conviction that the 'traditional inertia of Hopkins graduates<br />\nwas rather a habit than a chronic<br />\ncondition, the Club has always been<br />\ndesirious of initiating or endorsing<br />\nany suggestion that will create or<br />\npromote an interest in the University movement.<br />\nBy special arrangement,the members<br />\nof the Club are enabled to use the<br />\nHomewood Field and Tennis Courts<br />\nduring the summer months when the<br />\nUniversity is closed, and the House is<br />\nkept open at the same time for the<br />\nconvenience of members. To take<br />\nthe place of the open air exercise<br />\nduring the winter, a special gymnasium class is formed and trained in<br />\nthe University building. In time it<br />\nis the ambition of the Governors to<br />\nput up a house at Homewood containing a large common-room, bath<br />\nrooms, and all the conveniences and<br />\ncomforts that members could demand, in such a building.<br />\nThe increasing use of the house<br />\nat 227 Monument St. is a gratifying<br />\ncomment on the necessity of such a<br />\nClub. At the smokers, held every<br />\nSaturday evening, there is an attendance of from twenty-five to fifty men, and at the Field-Nights,<br />\nonce a month, the number swells to a<br />\nhundred or more. The point which<br />\nthe present administration of the<br />\nClub has been careful to insist on in<br />\nevery way, and on every possible<br />\noccasion, is that the Club is working<br />\nhand and glove with the other University organizations, with the Alumni Council, with the Alumni Association, and with the various Department Clubs in order to show that<br />\nthe aim for which all are striving is<br />\nthe best welfare of the University,<br />\nand that the only question is what<br />\nmeans should he ' adopted to gain<br />\nthis end most successfully.<br />\nAfter the Commemoration exercises, President Remsen announced the<br />\nnames of the successful candidates<br />\nfor the Alumni Council; these were<br />\nas follows:<br />\nDr. Thomas S. Baker, from the<br />\nPh.D. Group;<br />\nDr. Thomas R. Brown, from the<br />\nM.D. Group.;<br />\nMr. B. Howell Griswold, Jr., from<br />\nthe A.B. Group.<br />\nDr. St. George L. Sioussat, from<br />\nthe At-Large Group.<br />\nInterest in the election has been<br />\nwidespread, as ballots have come<br />\nfrom all parts of the country.. All<br />\nof the successful candidates, except<br />\nDr. Sioussat, are at present members<br />\nof the Council. Dr. Sioussat, A.B.<br />\n1896, Ph.D. 1909, one of the most<br />\nprominent of our younger graduates,<br />\nis Professor of History and Dean<br />\nof the University of the South.<br />\n<br />\n3.<br />\nALUMNI<br />\n<br />\nASSOCIATION<br />\n<br />\nThe annual meeting of tile Alumni Association, held February 22, in<br />\nthe Donovan Room, McCoy Hall, immediately after the close of the commemoration exercises, was well attended. The President of the Association, Dr. J. Whitridge Williams,<br />\npresided.<br />\nAfter considerable discussion, the<br />\nterm of the president was extended<br />\nfrom one to two years. Since the<br />\npresident of the Association is ex<br />\nofficio a member of the Alumni Council, the other members of whicn<br />\nserve four years, it was thought advisable to lengthen the term of the<br />\npresident of the Association so that<br />\nhe would have time to become familiar with the workings of the<br />\nCouncil and be able to accomplisn<br />\nconsiderable work before his term on<br />\nthe Council Board should expire.<br />\nThe balloting for officers of the<br />\nAssociation, which had been begun<br />\nby mail, was concluded, with the result that the following were elected:<br />\nPresident, J. Whitridge Williams;<br />\nsecretary, Wm. Sherman Bansemer ;<br />\ntreasurer, Horace E. Flack; members<br />\nof Executive Committee to serve for<br />\ntwo years\u2014Edward C. Armstrong,<br />\nRandolph Barton, Jr., George Stewart Brown, Alfred R. L. Dohme, Reid<br />\nHunt.<br />\nOf these, only Dr. Williams and<br />\nDr. Flack succeeded themselves. Mr.<br />\nWilliams S. Bansemer, A.B. 1894.,<br />\nthe newly elected secretary, is an attorney at law in Baltimore city, with<br />\noffices at 601 Maryland Telephone<br />\nBuilding, Baltimore, The ten members of the Executive Committee<br />\nhold office for two years, five being<br />\nelected every year. Of the five successful candidates, Dr. Armstrong'<br />\nand Dr. Hunt are professors in the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, Dr.Dohme<br />\nis a wholesale druggist, and Mr. Barton and Mr. Brown are lawyers.<br />\nThe Alumni Association is growing.<br />\nDuring the past ten years,<br />\nwhile Mr. Alfred J. Shriver was<br />\nsecretary of the ,Association, the<br />\nmembership increased from less than<br />\nfifty to nearly six hundred. This increase was due mainly to his efforts.<br />\nThe report of the acting secretary,<br />\nDr. Flack, showed good results coming from the campaign for increased<br />\nmembership of the Association. During the past month nearly two hundred members have been secured.<br />\nThere is every reason to believe that<br />\nthe members of the Association,<br />\nas the result of the interest now<br />\nbeing displayed, and of the efforts<br />\nbeing made,will increase until it shall<br />\nbecome substantially co-extensive<br />\nwith the list of the former students<br />\nof the University.

At certain other colleges<br />\nthere exists a senior society whose<br />\nfunction is: (I) To assist in shaping the policy of undergraduate<br />\nopinion. (2) To represent the unwhich<br />\ndergraduates in questions<br />\nshould be brought to the attention of<br />\nthe faculty.<br />\nTo have this society composed<br />\nsolely of seniors appears to us to too<br />\ngreatly restrict the membership; it is<br />\ndoubtful if such a body can be truly representative of the undergraduates. It is to be remembered, however, that sophomores and freshmen<br />\nare scarcely sufficiently familiar<br />\nwith University traditions to serve<br />\non such a board. The Senior-Junior Society therefore seems a suitable<br />\ncompromise. The introduction of<br />\nthe Honor System, the advisability of<br />\nrestricting athletics to strictly University affairs, the danger of cliques<br />\narising through too hearty support<br />\nof the different teams in inter-fraternity activities, the advisability of<br />\ninstituting a regulated system of<br />\ncuts\u2014such questions as these could<br />\nreceive proper and sensible consideration through the active existence<br />\nof such a society.

How<br />\none feels the inspiration of association, at a gattiering like this! How<br />\nforcibly .do such reunions impress up'On one the inestimable value of daily<br />\nintercourse among the students, the<br />\nliving together within the same<br />\nWalls, the sleeping under the same<br />\nroofs! Only under such conditions<br />\nWith such relations of daily life can<br />\nthe influence of our Alma Mater be<br />\nforcibly realized; and for the accomplishment of this end we have<br />\nThat<br />\nbut one goal\u2014Homewood.<br />\nUniversity<br />\nthe<br />\nthe establishment of<br />\nUpon this beautiful site is essential<br />\nznd vital to its welfare is undisputed. Some additional funds will be<br />\nnecessary actually to move, but this<br />\ntask accomplished and the University once there, Johns Hopkins will<br />\nbe the recipient of ample endowments, ever increasing in number,<br />\nWith which to pursue her splendid<br />\nWork in the field of education.<br />\nMany distinguished guests honored the alumni by their presence.<br />\nAmong them were, his Excellency,<br />\nthe German Ambassador, Count<br />\nBernstoff, and Dr. Robert Falconer,<br />\nPresident of Toronto University,the<br />\nnrasor of the day at the morning exercises in McCoy Hall. His Excellency in his admirable address dwelt<br />\nO n the feeling of good fellowship and<br />\nfriendly relations existing between<br />\nthe German Empire aryl this country,<br />\nexpressed the belief that the intercourse between the scientists and the<br />\nscholars of the Universities of the<br />\ntwo countries, Germany and the<br />\nPnited States, were potent factors<br />\nIn arousing and cementing such<br />\nfeelings of good will. He spoke<br />\nthe value<br />\nemphasis of<br />\nWith<br />\ncountry<br />\na<br />\nto<br />\nuniversity<br />\na<br />\nof<br />\nand pointed out how his government<br />\nturned to the different professors in<br />\nthe various German universities for<br /><br />\nBaltimore, Md., March 7, 1910.<br />\nthe solution of many problems and<br />\nfor settlement of the disturbing<br />\nquestions of the day. The address<br />\nof Count Bernstoff was eloquently<br />\nexpressed and was greeted with<br />\nhearty applause.<br />\nFew speakers have made a more<br />\nfavorable impression at any of the<br />\nCommemoration exercises than did<br />\nPresident Falconer. Manly and dignified in bearing, clear cut and forcible in speech, and fluent in diction,<br />\nhe went straight to the hearts of his<br />\nlisteners. As by its fruit shall you<br />\nknow the tree, so by its alumni shall<br />\nyou guage the true calibre of a<br />\nuniversity. Truth, great abiding<br />\ntruth is the aim, and to it, absolute<br />\nfidelity is due. Sincerity of mind,<br />\nand simplicity of mind must characterize the student. Attention to detail must be jealously guarded, care<br />\nmust be taken not to twist facts to<br />\nconform to theories, but to deduce<br />\ntheories from facts. Man can be of<br />\nservice when he has grasped some<br />\nThe Univerguiding principle.<br />\nisty offers fellowship with great<br />\nmen. True learning, with the conceptions of truth dominant will<br />\ngive a moral conception which will<br />\ngovern the world and the life and<br />\nspirit, so imbibed, will illumine and<br />\nenliven the civilization of the world.<br />\nSuch were some of the splendid<br />\nthoughts expressed by Dr. Falconer.<br />\nAmidst college yells, Dr. Remsen was then introduced. He spoke<br />\nof the value of academic freedom<br />\nand showed the tendency toward the<br />\napplication of the policy of protection, protection to \"infant industries,\" in the heavy endowment of<br />\ninstitutions of learning. He voiced<br />\na note of warning against the abuses<br />\nof endowment \u2014 the pauperizing of<br />\nthe student by excessive distribution<br />\nof fellowships and scholarships, the<br />\ndanger to the young investigator<br />\nfrom the foundation of institutes of<br />\nspecial research and investigation<br />\nwhich made no demands upon him<br />\nas a teacher and so deprived him of<br />\none of the most potent guides to<br />\nclarity of thought and largeness of<br />\nview, and an even greater danger in<br />\nthe demand of the community or the<br />\ngovernment for his services in connection with undertakings, official<br />\nand semi-official, that absorbed his<br />\ntime and his energies to the disadvantage of the institution where his<br />\nvocation lay.<br />\nCalls for (the) \"Keyser\" accompanied by an occasioned \"Hoch der<br />\nKaiser,\" were confusing to his Excellency, Count Bernstoff, until the<br />\npresident of the Board of Trustees<br />\nrose to make a few impromptu re-<br /><br />\nmarks. Mr. Keyser informed the<br />\nalumni that he greeted with earnest<br />\napproval the evidence shown by them<br />\nin their Alma Mater and in the efforts being made at the present time<br />\nby the Trustees to fulfill the conditions<br />\nimposed by the General Education<br />\nBoard upon their offer of $250,000<br />\nto the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThey looked to the Alumni to assist them in this undertaking and be<br />\nconsidered it their duty to do all in<br />\ntheir power to aid and benefit their<br />\nAlma Mater. To this end he extended a warm and cordial welcome<br />\nto the Alumni Council to co-operate<br />\nand to rouse others to co-operate in<br />\nthe great task.<br />\nDr. Elgin R. L. Gould, chairman<br />\nof the Committee on Endowment of<br />\nthe Alumni Council, and so representing that body on this occasion,<br />\nwas the next speaker, and he spoke<br />\nwith enthusiasm and effect from the<br />\nstandpoint of the alumni. He said<br />\nthat academic discussion of the best<br />\nmethods of raising funds was a futile waste of time, and that abstract<br />\npreparations for an endowment campaign should cease. Men are not<br />\npersuaded to give money by logical<br />\narguments carefully drawn up and<br />\nnicely expressed. They respond only to enthusiasm, to a spirit of emulation, and of friendly rivalry. Once<br />\nget men giving and others will give.<br />\nGet the ball started and it will continue to roll. For his part he stood<br />\nready to co-operate and to do his<br />\nbest to pay a share of the debt he<br />\nowed the University for what he had<br />\nreceived here as a graduate student<br />\nand as a holder of a fellowship. To<br />\ndo the work effectively, in his opinion, it was necessary to divide up<br />\nthe attacking forces, to \"differentiate\" the objects sought for, to separate into committees with some specific purpose before each of a nature to appeal to the individual approached. Let there be a \"Rowland<br />\nFund\" for the advancement of the<br />\nstudy of physics, a Gilman memorial<br />\nhousing those interests that Dr. Gilman had especially at heart, and other similar definite purposes for which<br />\nmoney is to be collected. As far as<br />\nhe was concerned a Gilman Fund<br />\nwould be that which he would specially like to raise. His advocacy<br />\nof this program aroused the interest<br />\nand approval of the Alumni who<br />\nshared his belief that with its adoption the work could be speedily and<br />\nsuccessfully accomplished.<br />\nLast came the representative of the<br />\nBachelors of Arts, Mr. Newton D.<br />\nBaker, City Solicitor of Cleveland,<br />\none of the earnest co-operators with<br /><br />\nPrice, 5 cents per copy.<br />\nMayor Tom Johnson and one of his<br />\nmost effective lieutenants. Mr. Baker spoke with all the zeal of a<br />\nspecial pleader, with great clearness<br />\nof voice and a ringing tone of conviction. He was puzzled, he said, to<br />\nnote how perplexing was the question of how to raise money for the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. In the<br />\nMiddle West financial support was<br />\nalways so spontaneously given, that<br />\nhe found it hard to appreciate the<br />\ndifficulties with which we seemed to<br />\nfind ourselves confronted. However,<br />\nin one instance he did recall that<br />\nthe bounty of a benefactor had a<br />\nstring attached to it\u2014$150,000 was<br />\noffered, provided $35o,000 was raised<br />\nby a certain time. The trustees<br />\nworked and worked, until on the afternoon of the fateful day, when the<br />\ntime expired for complying with the<br />\nconditions, they found themselves<br />\ntill short by $20,000 of the necessary amount. The institution to be<br />\nbenefited being theological in character, the trustees determined to have<br />\nrecourse to prayer. 'Twas 7 p.m.<br />\nThey prayed and prayed, until finally,<br />\nfive minutes before midnight, one<br />\nfrom their midst arose and said,<br />\n\"Brethren, our prayer is answered;<br />\nI will give it myself.\" Mr. Baker<br />\nspoke at length upon the social conditions existing in the Middle West,<br />\nwith an eloquence and understanding that held the attention of all<br />\npresent. He declared that that section of the country, freed somewhat<br />\ntoday from the thraldom of corrupt<br />\npolitical despotism, was now seething<br />\nwith socialistic doctrines and tendencies and that although much good<br />\nhad been accomplished in the placing of healthful restrictions around<br />\nthe employment of child labor, restrictions fundamental to the maintenance of a high standard of manhood in the country, and in the passing of other laws\u2014still, mere law<br />\nwas only a partial remedy, and the<br />\nonly salvation lay in raising the<br />\nstandard of men. Here was the opportunity and duty of the University. Turn out men that cannot<br />\nsteal and lie, men whose prejudices<br />\nare softened in the presence of higher knowledge and broader experience, men to whom the search for<br />\ntruth and belief in the truth are<br />\nhigher than the business of feathering the nest and lining the pocket.<br />\nLet the University, in the words of<br />\nCalvin, receive us as wood and return us to the world fashioned as<br />\narrows to pierce the fallacies that<br />\nare constantly menacing our personal and national welfare.<br />\nIt was a splendid reunion.

The Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool has been enabled to advance<br />\nthe cause of higher medical education and to establish standards which<br />\nare distinctive, and the reasons for<br />\nsuch an organization as that contemplated are perhaps even stronger<br />\nthan in the case of other medical<br />\nschools, which have profited so much<br />\nby similar alumni associations.<br />\nWith best wishes for the success<br />\nof the efforts of those engaged in<br />\nforming the organization and assurance of the heartiest co-operation on<br />\nthe part of all connected with the<br />\nschool, I am<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\nWilliam H. Welch.\"<br />\nDr. Osler says in lis letter to one<br />\nof the Council, \"It would help the<br />\nschool immensely to feel that the<br />\ngraduates were in close touch and<br />\ntheir advice should be sought in certain matters. A great many of them<br />\nare now in positions from which<br />\nthey recognize the lines of development along which a school like the<br />\nJohns Hopkins should take. A large<br />\ninfluental body of graduate opinion<br />\nkeeps faculty and trustees up to the<br />\nmark. Recent appointments indicate<br />\nthat the proper spirit is maintained,<br />\nbut institutions, like individuals, have<br />\ntheir periods of ill-health,when things<br />\ndo not go well and it is at just this<br />\nemergency that the graduate body is<br />\nmost helpful.\"<br />\nWe feel that all graduates of the<br />\nmedical school will follow the counsel of our distinguished teachers and<br />\ndo their utmost to make the organization of our alumni worthy of the<br />\nundergraduate school we represent.<br />\nPlans for the reunion are well under way. Whether or not it is desirable for the graduates of the<br />\nMedical School to form a permanent alumni organization is a question that ought to be considered<br />\ncarefully from the point of view of<br />\nthe Alumni Association as a whole.<br />\nCertainly no step will be taken that<br />\nis likely to prevent the Alumni Association from receiving the full<br />\nsupport of the Medical Alumni.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS CLUB<br />\nFi on, the beginning of the University, there was felt the need of a social center which found expression<br />\nin various ways. The Club that used<br />\nto meet in Little Garden St., filled<br />\nthis want and, begun and continued<br />\nafter \u2022 a German model, satisfied the<br />\ncraving for companionship and intercourse which finally materialized<br />\nin the present University Club. As<br />\nthis enlarged its scope, however, it<br />\nlost its character as a Hopkins Institution, and the call for such an organization became more and more urgent. This was recognized in 1899,<br />\nwhen a circular letter was sent to<br />\n!hose interested in such a project<br />\nsuggesting the formation of an exclusively Hopkins Institution. This<br />\nappeal was signed by the following<br />\ngentlemen: J. S. Ames, R. Garret,<br />\nA. J. Shriver, W. Newcomer, J. H.<br />\nHollander, G. G. Morrison, V. A.<br />\nRenouf, and H. B. Adams. The response was immediate, and the present Johns<br />\nHopkins Club<br />\nwas<br />\nsuccessfully inaugurated. After some<br />\nyears of useful existence, there<br />\nwas a lapse of vitality and efficiency, which seemed to some<br />\nof the gentlemen interested to<br />\nbe caused by the lack of adequate<br />\naccommodation, and largely through<br />\nthe efforts of Mr. W. H. Buckler, one<br />\nof the trustees of the University, the<br />\nhouse at 227 W. Monument St., was<br />\npurchased, a home that was admirably fitted for the purpose in mind.<br />\nThis was in 1905, and since then,<br />\nthe Club has enjoyed a new era of<br />\nprosperity. Under the present direction it has broadened its outlook,<br />\nand enlarged its usefulness in many<br />\ndirections, keeping strictly, however,<br />\nwithin its lines as an exclusively University movement. In its present<br />\nform it responds to a distinct demand, and has taken a place in the<br />\nUniversity life held by no other of<br />\nthe University Clubs or Associations.<br />\nIt was felt that Hopkins men<br />\nshould have a rallying point after<br />\nimmediate<br />\nwith<br />\nconnection<br />\nthe University had ceased, that<br />\nthere should be a centre for the<br />\nalumni, where committees on business connected with the University<br />\ncould meet, where dinners and reunions could be given, where gradu-ite-students could find pleasant quarters, where alumni living at a distance could find pleasant accommoda'ions and friends when called to the<br />\ncity, rand this the Johns Hopkins<br />\nClub aims to furnish to its members.<br />\nAt present the Alumni Association<br />\nhas no quarters, and all records<br />\nchange hands .and home with the<br />\nchange of officers. It has been strongly recommended that it would be much<br />\nmore satisfactory for the Association<br />\nto take a suitable room at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club-house where all the<br />\nrecords should be kept permanently,<br />\nsuch as a card catalogue of the members of the Association at large, and<br />\nof all branch associations, the Hop1,7:ns publications, and other Univervi'y matter, of interest to the Alumni.<br />\nMoreover, as it does not seem possi-<br /><br />\nble at present for the Alumni Council to be provided with proper quarters in the University buildings, they<br />\ncould find a permanent Committeeroom in the Club-house which would<br />\nbe assured to them for their exclusive use, where meetings could be<br />\nheld and material kept safely, undisturbed by other possible occupants.<br />\nWith the conviction that the 'traditional inertia of Hopkins graduates<br />\nwas rather a habit than a chronic<br />\ncondition, the Club has always been<br />\ndesirious of initiating or endorsing<br />\nany suggestion that will create or<br />\npromote an interest in the University movement.<br />\nBy special arrangement,the members<br />\nof the Club are enabled to use the<br />\nHomewood Field and Tennis Courts<br />\nduring the summer months when the<br />\nUniversity is closed, and the House is<br />\nkept open at the same time for the<br />\nconvenience of members. To take<br />\nthe place of the open air exercise<br />\nduring the winter, a special gymnasium class is formed and trained in<br />\nthe University building. In time it<br />\nis the ambition of the Governors to<br />\nput up a house at Homewood containing a large common-room, bath<br />\nrooms, and all the conveniences and<br />\ncomforts that members could demand, in such a building.<br />\nThe increasing use of the house<br />\nat 227 Monument St. is a gratifying<br />\ncomment on the necessity of such a<br />\nClub. At the smokers, held every<br />\nSaturday evening, there is an attendance of from twenty-five to fifty men, and at the Field-Nights,<br />\nonce a month, the number swells to a<br />\nhundred or more. The point which<br />\nthe present administration of the<br />\nClub has been careful to insist on in<br />\nevery way, and on every possible<br />\noccasion, is that the Club is working<br />\nhand and glove with the other University organizations, with the Alumni Council, with the Alumni Association, and with the various Department Clubs in order to show that<br />\nthe aim for which all are striving is<br />\nthe best welfare of the University,<br />\nand that the only question is what<br />\nmeans should he ' adopted to gain<br />\nthis end most successfully.<br />\nAfter the Commemoration exercises, President Remsen announced the<br />\nnames of the successful candidates<br />\nfor the Alumni Council; these were<br />\nas follows:<br />\nDr. Thomas S. Baker, from the<br />\nPh.D. Group;<br />\nDr. Thomas R. Brown, from the<br />\nM.D. Group.;<br />\nMr. B. Howell Griswold, Jr., from<br />\nthe A.B. Group.<br />\nDr. St. George L. Sioussat, from<br />\nthe At-Large Group.<br />\nInterest in the election has been<br />\nwidespread, as ballots have come<br />\nfrom all parts of the country.. All<br />\nof the successful candidates, except<br />\nDr. Sioussat, are at present members<br />\nof the Council. Dr. Sioussat, A.B.<br />\n1896, Ph.D. 1909, one of the most<br />\nprominent of our younger graduates,<br />\nis Professor of History and Dean<br />\nof the University of the South.<br /><br />\n3.<br />\nALUMNI<br /><br />\nASSOCIATION<br /><br />\nThe annual meeting of tile Alumni Association, held February 22, in<br />\nthe Donovan Room, McCoy Hall, immediately after the close of the commemoration exercises, was well attended. The President of the Association, Dr. J. Whitridge Williams,<br />\npresided.<br />\nAfter considerable discussion, the<br />\nterm of the president was extended<br />\nfrom one to two years. Since the<br />\npresident of the Association is ex<br />\nofficio a member of the Alumni Council, the other members of whicn<br />\nserve four years, it was thought advisable to lengthen the term of the<br />\npresident of the Association so that<br />\nhe would have time to become familiar with the workings of the<br />\nCouncil and be able to accomplisn<br />\nconsiderable work before his term on<br />\nthe Council Board should expire.<br />\nThe balloting for officers of the<br />\nAssociation, which had been begun<br />\nby mail, was concluded, with the result that the following were elected:<br />\nPresident, J. Whitridge Williams;<br />\nsecretary, Wm. Sherman Bansemer ;<br />\ntreasurer, Horace E. Flack; members<br />\nof Executive Committee to serve for<br />\ntwo years\u2014Edward C. Armstrong,<br />\nRandolph Barton, Jr., George Stewart Brown, Alfred R. L. Dohme, Reid<br />\nHunt.<br />\nOf these, only Dr. Williams and<br />\nDr. Flack succeeded themselves. Mr.<br />\nWilliams S. Bansemer, A.B. 1894.,<br />\nthe newly elected secretary, is an attorney at law in Baltimore city, with<br />\noffices at 601 Maryland Telephone<br />\nBuilding, Baltimore, The ten members of the Executive Committee<br />\nhold office for two years, five being<br />\nelected every year. Of the five successful candidates, Dr. Armstrong'<br />\nand Dr. Hunt are professors in the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, Dr.Dohme<br />\nis a wholesale druggist, and Mr. Barton and Mr. Brown are lawyers.<br />\nThe Alumni Association is growing.<br />\nDuring the past ten years,<br />\nwhile Mr. Alfred J. Shriver was<br />\nsecretary of the ,Association, the<br />\nmembership increased from less than<br />\nfifty to nearly six hundred. This increase was due mainly to his efforts.<br />\nThe report of the acting secretary,<br />\nDr. Flack, showed good results coming from the campaign for increased<br />\nmembership of the Association. During the past month nearly two hundred members have been secured.<br />\nThere is every reason to believe that<br />\nthe members of the Association,<br />\nas the result of the interest now<br />\nbeing displayed, and of the efforts<br />\nbeing made,will increase until it shall<br />\nbecome substantially co-extensive<br />\nwith the list of the former students<br />\nof the University.
