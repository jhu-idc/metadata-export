DAVID LEEDER<br />\n<br />\nBy CHARLES CROWELL<br />\n<br />\nThe recent Civil Rights Act is<br />\nneither a cure-all nor a mere<br />\npolitical gimmick; rather it is a<br />\nsmall step toward the emancipation of the American soul. I<br />\nhave no doubt as to its necessity<br />\nor constitutionality; it merely<br />\nguarantees certain basic human<br />\nrights too long denied to too<br />\nmany Americans.<br />\n<br />\nIn recent years, the need for<br />\nsome sort of government action<br />\non the Negro question has become<br />\napparent. The problem arises for<br />\nthe conservative of finding a<br />\nsolution which would work within the governmental limitations<br />\nimposed by the Constitution and<br />\nwhich would in no large way endanger the traditional liberties<br />\nthen shared by all Americans.<br />\nThe first question arising in<br />\nthis connection is concerned<br />\nwith the nature of the problem,<br />\nthat is its sources and causes.<br />\nIt is also important, lest the risk<br />\nbe run of condemning a sizable<br />\nportion of the American population as hopeless, immoral bigots,<br />\nto understand the feelings of the<br />\npeople involved\u2014both black and<br />\nwhite. The conservative approach<br />\nwould from the beginning assume that the problem in different areas is different by nature and tradition and would<br />\ntreat the problem accordingly.<br />\nThe answer to the first question can be answered simply that<br />\nthe Negro has been denied broad<br />\naccess to the cultural and economic opportunities in this country. The problem is centered in<br />\nthe South, since those Negroes<br />\nwho are not in the South have<br />\nprobably come from the South<br />\nduring this century. The problem is broader than the Negro<br />\nand must include the poor whites.<br />\nThe people are victims of misunderstandings and have reached<br />\nseemingly logical conclusions<br />\nconcerning the Negro. With this<br />\ncomes the first apparent means<br />\nof attackng the problem. This attack should be centered in the<br />\nrealm of public information and<br />\npublic opinion. The President is<br />\nin a position to influence public<br />\nopinion in a large way, and if<br />\nthis is not sufficient, it may become necessary to provide a public information service to deal<br />\nwith the problem.<br />\nFurther, since the problem is<br />\ncentered in the South, the problem in the South must be considered apart from the problem<br />\nin the rest of the country. On<br />\nexamination, it will be found<br />\nthat the South is suffering under<br />\nthe burden of many more problems. The majority of all<br />\nSoutherners are unable to take<br />\npart in the educational, cultural,<br />\nand economic abundance of the<br />\nnation. The average Southern<br />\nincome is less than half that<br />\n(Continued on Page 7).<br />\n<br />\nWhile it does not pretend to<br />\nsolve all the racial probems of<br />\nmid-century America, it does<br />\nplace the government firmly on<br />\nthe side of freedom. Far from<br />\nusurping the role of the states,<br />\nit provides a most reasonable<br />\ntime for the local governments to<br />\naccept their responsibility.<br />\nTo suggest that the Civil<br />\nRights Act is a failure because it<br />\ndid not forestall the rioting in<br />\ncertain northern cities this summer is to impute a greater scope<br />\nto the law than its originators<br />\nhad intended. The Act corrects<br />\ncertain ills suffered mainly by<br />\nSouthern Negroes. It would be<br />\nunreasonable and unrealistic to<br />\nexpect that such a long overdue<br />\nredress to a few glaring inequities in American life would be<br />\nenough to satisfy all the needs<br />\nof a captive and deprived people.<br />\nA Beginning<br />\nEqual accommodations, no matter how basic, is essentially<br />\nmeaningless when you live in a<br />\nrat-infested ghetto isolated from<br />\nthe mainstream of American society, and when you are unemployed and unemployable. Our<br />\nsociety has attempted, almost<br />\nsuccessfully, to make the poor<br />\nand the racial minorities invisible. But you can not hide human beings by ignoring their<br />\nexistence.<br />\nWhat is needed is a massive<br />\nassault on the roots of the problems that are gnawing at the<br />\nsoul of our society. The government has at last recognized that<br />\nthere is a problem and it is to<br />\nthe credit of President Johnson<br />\nthat he has committed the nation to wage a war on poverty.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the weapons are so meager, but it is a<br />\nbeginning, and hopefully it will<br />\nnot be abandoned, but rather<br />\nescalated into a total involvement of American intellectual<br />\nand economic resources.<br />\n<br />\nOnce in their respective countries, Stearns and Rubin will be<br />\nattached to groups operated by<br />\nthe local government.

As the Republican Presidential Candidate's<br />\nchances of winning in November<br />\ndiminish, the inanity of his<br />\ncharges is amplified. This is well<br />\ndemonstrated by Goldwater's recent charge that President Johnson is \"soft on Communism.\"<br />\nThis very old smear is among the<br />\nmost unoriginal charges which<br />\nGoldwater has used in attacking<br />\nthe President; in fact, it (this<br />\ncharge) is notable as a crutch<br />\nupon which many a McCarthyite<br />\neither running for public office<br />\nor else attempting to affect<br />\nAmerican political currents has<br />\nfallen in the past when another<br />\nissue of really major importance<br />\nhas not been in evidence.<br />\nSuch vituperative tactics as<br />\nhave been utilized by Goldwater<br />\nand even more by his running<br />\nmate, William Miller, merely<br />\nserve to obliterate aspects of<br />\nfair play in American politics.<br />\nLegitimate charges and constructive criticism are always<br />\nnecessary and useful.

The<br />\nfact that all the windows facing onto Keyser<br />\nQuadrangle were closed only increased this interest.<br />\nOne individual thought he saw a stranger peering<br />\nout of one of the Gilman windows, but it was merely<br />\na uniformed policeman. Another student commented<br />\nthat the police patrolling the roofs of the buildings<br />\ngave him the feeling he was being herded into a<br />\nprison exercise yard.<br />\nAs the time of arrival neared, many spectators<br />\nbegan to grow restless. A group of four or five Notre<br />\nDame girls thought it would be great fun to annoy<br />\none of the less suave Hop undergraduates. The latter,<br />\nwho was contentedly standing on a brown attache<br />\ncase \"which elevates me at least five inches above<br />\nthe ground and enables me to see better,\" was asked<br />\nto give up his perch in the \"name of chivalry.\" Initially caught offguard, he told the girls that they were<br />\nso short that the..platform wouldn't help them. The<br />\ngirls countered by saying that he was so heavy that<br />\nhe would probably damage the case by standing on<br />\nit. Happily, our boy ended the exchange in the true<br />\nHop spirit by saying that \"at least, if this here case<br />\ncollapses, it'll be while I'M on it, not you!\" \u2022<br />\nAs at all large gatherings, there were a few people<br />\nwho, try as they might, could not satisfy themselves<br />\nwith their view of the speaker's platform. The most<br />\n<br />\npopular method for Hopkins men to move ahead in<br />\nthe mob was to feign a sophisticated involvement in<br />\nthe event. Most students in this category were those<br />\nwho used unloaded cameras and very collegiate pipes<br />\nas their pa-ssports to the front of the plus 7,000 crowd.<br />\nAlso fairly popular was the use of the pretense of<br />\nhaving to meet one's companions, preferably female.<br />\nThe worst personal predicament resulting from<br />\nthe President's visit befell a never-say-die freshman.<br />\nThis frosh was trying in vain to get a clear view<br />\nof Johnson (just before his helicopter departure) in<br />\norder to take a snapshot. After all other measures<br />\nfailed, he tapped a big brute in front of him to ask<br />\nto exchange positions. Said brute, who was in the<br />\nprocess of embracing his girl friend and probably<br />\nalready ill-tempered from the pushing of the mob,<br />\nturned around in a fury. He warned the freshman<br />\nthat if he were bothered again, he would knock our<br />\nhero's teeth out. Still not to be defeated, our man<br />\nhad two friends lift him up on their shoulders. Just<br />\nas he was about to snap the alaSsit picture Of Johnson kissing a baby (yes, even President's do that),<br />\n\u2022his chums collapsed under his excessive weight, and<br />\nhe fell hard againit the bruiser.

DAVID LEEDER<br /><br />\nBy CHARLES CROWELL<br /><br />\nThe recent Civil Rights Act is<br />\nneither a cure-all nor a mere<br />\npolitical gimmick; rather it is a<br />\nsmall step toward the emancipation of the American soul. I<br />\nhave no doubt as to its necessity<br />\nor constitutionality; it merely<br />\nguarantees certain basic human<br />\nrights too long denied to too<br />\nmany Americans.<br /><br />\nIn recent years, the need for<br />\nsome sort of government action<br />\non the Negro question has become<br />\napparent. The problem arises for<br />\nthe conservative of finding a<br />\nsolution which would work within the governmental limitations<br />\nimposed by the Constitution and<br />\nwhich would in no large way endanger the traditional liberties<br />\nthen shared by all Americans.<br />\nThe first question arising in<br />\nthis connection is concerned<br />\nwith the nature of the problem,<br />\nthat is its sources and causes.<br />\nIt is also important, lest the risk<br />\nbe run of condemning a sizable<br />\nportion of the American population as hopeless, immoral bigots,<br />\nto understand the feelings of the<br />\npeople involved\u2014both black and<br />\nwhite. The conservative approach<br />\nwould from the beginning assume that the problem in different areas is different by nature and tradition and would<br />\ntreat the problem accordingly.<br />\nThe answer to the first question can be answered simply that<br />\nthe Negro has been denied broad<br />\naccess to the cultural and economic opportunities in this country. The problem is centered in<br />\nthe South, since those Negroes<br />\nwho are not in the South have<br />\nprobably come from the South<br />\nduring this century. The problem is broader than the Negro<br />\nand must include the poor whites.<br />\nThe people are victims of misunderstandings and have reached<br />\nseemingly logical conclusions<br />\nconcerning the Negro. With this<br />\ncomes the first apparent means<br />\nof attackng the problem. This attack should be centered in the<br />\nrealm of public information and<br />\npublic opinion. The President is<br />\nin a position to influence public<br />\nopinion in a large way, and if<br />\nthis is not sufficient, it may become necessary to provide a public information service to deal<br />\nwith the problem.<br />\nFurther, since the problem is<br />\ncentered in the South, the problem in the South must be considered apart from the problem<br />\nin the rest of the country. On<br />\nexamination, it will be found<br />\nthat the South is suffering under<br />\nthe burden of many more problems. The majority of all<br />\nSoutherners are unable to take<br />\npart in the educational, cultural,<br />\nand economic abundance of the<br />\nnation. The average Southern<br />\nincome is less than half that<br />\n(Continued on Page 7).<br /><br />\nWhile it does not pretend to<br />\nsolve all the racial probems of<br />\nmid-century America, it does<br />\nplace the government firmly on<br />\nthe side of freedom.

The Act corrects<br />\ncertain ills suffered mainly by<br />\nSouthern Negroes. It would be<br />\nunreasonable and unrealistic to<br />\nexpect that such a long overdue<br />\nredress to a few glaring inequities in American life would be<br />\nenough to satisfy all the needs<br />\nof a captive and deprived people.<br />\nA Beginning<br />\nEqual accommodations, no matter how basic, is essentially<br />\nmeaningless when you live in a<br />\nrat-infested ghetto isolated from<br />\nthe mainstream of American society, and when you are unemployed and unemployable.

However,<br />\nsince they are minus the services<br />\nof one returnee because of an<br />\nautomobile accident, the fray is<br />\nrated a toss-up.<br />\n\"One spot is going to make the<br />\ndifference just as it did last year<br />\nwhen we lost by five points,\" declared Jay crosscountry coach,<br />\nEd Polanowski,\" . . . it's going<br />\nto be a very tight meet.\"<br />\nFour Spearhead Squad<br />\nPolanowski cited that Kevin<br />\nMurphy, Van Clark, Jack Loomis, and John Sopka should spearhead his squad.

Jim<br />\nZevely, Bob Knauff, Ogden<br />\nHamilton, and goalies Rick<br />\nJelousek and Mary Otell turned<br />\nin steady defensive work, with<br />\nZevely performing well both<br />\nways from right halfback; but,<br />\nfor the most part, it was a good<br />\nthing that we were able to score<br />\nand take pressure off the defense, as it was not too steady<br />\nat times.\"<br />\nBreaks Records<br />\nDrobny's five goals break the<br />\nexisting school record set by AllAmerican co-captain Lucky Mallonnee who tallied his four in<br />\none quarter last year.

Last<br />\nyear's contest against the Pennsylvania school provided Jay grid<br />\nfans with their most exciting<br />\nmoments, as Hopkins came from<br />\nbehind to gain a 15-15 tie.<br /><br />\ntempting to thwart the fine play<br />\nof this veteran team which is led<br />\nby All-American Bob Nix and<br />\nlast year's top scorer, Bill Schinninger.

The Red Devils faded<br />\nclared the Middle Atlantic Conin the second half, however, in<br />\nference to be as strong, if not<br />\ncoach Barrette's opinion, as they<br />\nstronger, than last year.

In the first quarter,<br />\nafter a Jerry Pfeifer pass was<br />\nintercepted on the Jay 27, Murono hit his favorite receiver,<br />\nfullback Rick Johnson, on a<br />\ndown and out pattern for a 25<br />\nyard touchdown pass. Bill Glasser added his first of three con-versions.<br />\nJays Score<br />\nIn the second period Murono<br />\nagain connected with Johnson to<br />\ngive the Diplomats a 14-0 lead<br />\nat halftime. After another tally<br />\nplaced the Diplomats out in<br />\nfront 21-0, Hopkins broke into<br />\nthe scoring column with less<br />\nthan four minutes to play.<br />\nPfeifer<br />\nQuarterback<br />\nengineered a 72 yard march for paydirt after having fumbled on the<br />\nF&amp;M 16 on the last series of<br />\ndowns. The senior co-captain<br />\ncompleted passes to Jim MacNaughton for 12 yards, Ron Del<br />\nCotto for 18 and Frank Szoka<br />\nfor 11 to set up the touchdown<br />\naerial. Pfeifer hit Del Cotto with<br />\na 21 yard pass over the middle.<br />\nCoach Comments<br />\nFewster, when analyzing the<br />\ngame, stated that \"our running<br />\ngame has made tremendous improvement over last year. We<br />\nplayed a fairly decent game, better than last year, but we were<br />\ngeared toward stopping the running game of F&amp;M.\"<br />\n\"We knew that Murono could<br />\nthrow the ball, but we didn't figure him to throw it that well.<br />\nAlso a poor rush added to our<br />\ndefense problems.\"<br />\nA Favorite Rendez Wu<br />\nfor Hopkins Men<br /><br />\nJIMMY WU'S<br />\nNEW<br />\nCHINA INN<br />\nCharles Street below 25th<br />\nJIMMY WU'S<br />\nCARRY OUT SHOP<br />\n1411 E.
