The first waiver occurred when<br />\nChinese graduate students presented us with a letter in<br />\nreference to a planned protest in Washington. Fearful of<br />\npossible retribution against themselves or their families,<br />\nthese students requested anonymity. There could be little<br />\nquestion that they were indeed in danger so, under what<br />\nwe considered to be exceptional circumstances, the NewsLetter agreed to withold names.<br />\nIt is to our great embarrassment that we feel compelled<br />\na second time to withhold the name of a letter writer in order<br />\nto protect them from retribution.

When legitimate fear of physical or emotional harrassment is pervasive enough to restrict the free exchange<br />\nof ideas, we are no longer fulfilling our role as either an<br />\ninstitution of higher learning, or as a democratic community. The fear in question is real, and should not be dismissed<br />\nby those who, consciously or not, perceive themselves in<br />\na position of strength.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the situaton at hand concerns the fraternity<br />\nsystem, we believe the problem of intolerance to be too<br />\nimportant to blame on any one segment of Homewood;<br />\nthe responsibility for its resolution lies with us all. It is<br />\ntime for all of us to reevaluate our behavior and feelings<br />\ntowards those who may not belong to our own private corner of Hopkins and the world in general.<br />\nUntil then, we deplore a \"human climate\" in which a<br />\nwriter need fear for their peace within the Hopkins community for having perceived flaws in the fraternity system,<br />\nand suggested what they consider to be an appropriate<br />\nresolution.

It is<br />\nwhen these \"newly emancipated\" students are completely in control of their life's decisions that his or her environment<br />\nand peer pressure from fellow<br />\nstudents play into abuse.

Aside from<br />\nsocializing, the main focus of<br />\ntheir \"parties\" (at which the new<br />\nstudent is supposed to \"open new<br />\ndoors\") is alcohol and drugs.

Since the area is fortunate<br />\nenough to be free of national<br />\nparks, it does not draw a<br />\ndisproportionate number of<br />\ntourists like western Wyoming<br />\n(Yellowstone/Grand Teton). Like<br />\nYellowstone, some areas of the<br />\nCarson National Forest near the<br />\nColorado/New Mexico border<br />\nhave large elk herds. This is supposedly one of the best elk hunting grounds in the nation. I've<br />\nbeen told that an organization<br />\nwhich owns a large tract of land<br />\nadjacent to the national forest<br />\ncharges people $5000 a day to<br />\nhunt elk on their land. And people must pay it if they charge that<br />\nmuch. It's a playground of the<br />\nsuper-wealthy.

For most people,<br />\nmyself included, the state of New<br />\nMexico is associated with visions<br />\nof a flat, searing, cactus and<br />\nsagebrush-filled landscape. At<br />\nleast until one pays a visit. There<br />\nis a good portion of the landscape<br />\nwhich closely matches the frequently imagined view of the<br />\nestate, much of it over near the<br />\nTexas border. But many fail to<br />\nrealize that the Rocky Mountains<br />\nextend down from Colorado into<br />\nnorth central New Mexico. High<br />\nelevations (up to 13,000 feet)<br />\ncombined with more southern<br />\nlatitude make for some tremendous forests of pine, fir, and<br />\naspen trees, along with plenty of<br />\nlush green meadows. Precipitation levels are fairly high, so<br />\nmountain streams are plentiful.<br />\nBecause there are no large<br />\npopulation centers nearby, the<br />\nforests and meadows see fewer<br />\npeople, thus less damage, than the<br />\nlegendary forests of the Cascade<br />\n<br />\na581/11V AUJANCe's-TRATEGY 5555/04;<br />\nWeruc<br />\nweo/VG curr-H Val?<br />\nRESAVID<br />\nro 5-ruces- OF Al4A9kE77NG- TEcfAliQuEr.

It was but one<br />\nunit in a set of new building block<br />\ninstitutions on our campus.

This revitalized social<br />\norganization is a community, and<br />\ncommunitities are what maintain<br />\nsociety's future. Hopefully, this<br />\ncommunity will continue to build<br />\nitself, and its example may inspire other social entrepreneurs to<br />\nattempt similar feats.<br />\nTo this year's freshmen, I will<br />\n<br />\nrepeat what our student council<br />\npresident used to say to anyone<br />\nwho preferred complaints over<br />\nactions: \"It's your school.\" Take<br />\nresponsibility for your school. Do<br />\nwhat you can do; you owe<br />\nyourself no less. Your faculty and<br />\nadministration may foster a cutthroat atmosphere that makes talk<br />\nof the reestablishment of an honor<br />\ncode laughable; they may not require that foreign teaching<br />\nassistants learn English; they may<br />\nregard student housing for<br />\nupperclassmen a strategic<br />\nposteriority; they may not even<br />\nbother to show up for their own<br />\nmeetings to address student concerns; but it is still your school<br />\nand your community. It is your<br />\nprivilege, and yes, your duty to<br />\ncontribute to one of the last of<br />\nAmerica's great social institutions. In the end it is you, the student, who is at fault if you do not<br />\nconstructively change the university.

He answered some<br />\nimportant questions, such as what<br />\nto do if a condom breaks; Women<br />\nshould apply extra nonoxynolcontaining spermicide and douche<br />\nrepeatedly with warm water. If<br />\ntheir partner complains that their<br />\n\"organ\" is too small, men should<br />\nreply, \"I'm sorry that my organ<br />\nis too small for your<br />\nauditorium.\" If your partner has<br />\n<br />\nsigns of venereal disease,<br />\n\"vomit, faint, do whatever you<br />\nhave to do to avoid having sex.\"<br />\nGoettel offered a test to find out<br />\nif you're really in love.

This week it's time for<br />\nsome main dish ideas with that<br />\nall-American favorite: hamburger<br />\nhamburger.<br />\nContrary to its bad reputation<br />\nin these cholesterol and red-meat<br />\nwary days, hamburger is not bad<br />\nfor you, as long as you cook it<br />\nproperly and don't eat it every<br />\nday.<br />\nLike most meats, there are different kinds of hamburger. Plain<br />\nground beef contains the most fat;<br />\nground chuck and ground round<br />\ncontain less. Giant carries lean<br />\nand extra lean ground beef as<br />\nwell.<br />\nExtra lean ground beef or<br />\nground round is the best to buy.<br />\nExtra lean costs the same per<br />\npound as regular ground beef;<br />\nground round is a little more expensive, so watch for sale prices.<br />\nA good price for ground round is<br />\n$1.99/1b. or less.<br />\nWith these leaner ground meats<br />\nyou get more for your money<br />\nbecause less of the weight cooks<br />\n<br />\noff as fat. Their lower fat content<br />\nalso makes them more nutritious.<br />\nYou can safely refrigerate hamburger for 1-2 days. Store it in the<br />\ncoldest part of your refrigerator.<br />\nFreezing it will allow you to store<br />\nit for a month or two. Put the<br />\nunopened package into a plastic<br />\nbag and freeze it.<br />\nThawing should be done in<br />\nyour microwave or refrigerator.<br />\nLeaving it out on the counter to<br />\nthaw increases the chances of<br />\nfood poisoning. Follow your<br />\nmicrowave thawing directions.<br />\nFor refrigerator thawing, put the<br />\nfrozen meat in the refrigerator the<br />\nnight before you plan to use it,<br />\nbut DO NOT refreeze the thawed, uncooked meat. You can also<br />\ncook the frozen meat straight, but<br />\nit will take a little longer.<br />\nYou can microwave ground<br />\nbeef. Follow the instructions in<br />\nyour microwave book.<br />\nFor cooking it on the stove use<br />\na large skillet, a sauce pan. Cook<br />\nthe meat until the surface is completely brown. This is called<br />\nbrowning. Stir the meat often<br />\nwhile you are cooking to keep it<br />\n<br />\nfrom burning.<br />\nTo drain the grease, follow<br />\nthese steps.<br />\nI. Brown the meat thoroughly.<br />\n2. Turn off the burner.<br />\n3. Scrape the meat over to one<br />\nside and tilt the pan or skillet so<br />\nfat drains to the other side.<br />\n4. Spoon the hot fat into an<br />\nempty metal can. NEVER,<br />\nNEVER, NEVER pour grease<br />\ndown the drain, because you will<br />\nget a clogged drain and your<br />\nlandlord will not be happy.<br />\n5. If your pan is small, you can<br />\nput a triple layer of paper towels<br />\non a plate and dump the cooked<br />\nmeat onto the plate. The towels<br />\nwill absorb a lot of the grease.<br />\nNow that you've cooked and<br />\ndrained your ground beef, it's<br />\ntime to make it into a meal. An<br />\neasy choice is to simply add<br />\nspaghetti sauce and perhaps some<br />\nchopped onion and/or green pepper. A good amount is one<br />\nmedium onion and one medium<br />\ngreen pepper.<br />\nHowever, there is life beyond<br />\nspaghetti.<br />\nAn easy, but not really cheap,<br />\n<br />\nSt.Paul Cleaners<br />\n3120 St.<br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAY CLEANING AND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRING<br />\n<br />\n10% discount on all dry cleaning<br />\nexpires 10/27/89<br />\n<br />\nCAREER<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 1 R&D ENGINEER<br />\n2 TECHNICAL SUPPORT ENGINEER<br />\n<br />\n788-4400<br />\n<br />\n[4:0<br />\n<br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n8 30-5 00p Ill<br />\n<br />\nVISA<br />\n) MEM<br />\n<br />\n5602 Baltimore National Pike *600<br />\n<br />\n<A4z3M\u2022*61)3:170<br />\n<br />\nOPPORTUNITIES<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nMY'f4CDSUN<br />\n<br />\nIN<br />\n<br />\nJAPAN<br />\n<br />\nSUNIg5911VcOWS( \u2014---- -'3 %)?< ---JJ \u2014 Z'10<br />\n<br />\nS'YO1Wilia'gtcL4AtLitZ._1.<br />\n<br />\n;%51LC,<br />\n'itttt%6<br />\n1 01*<br />\nL''tMODSCIVAI)c13E41,7_5ttLI%-liME13-C2l- \u2014<br />\nEi*meru<br />\n4-0<br />\n7730%1-,L.L667') r\u2014y,fkor21s,, SUNIg-f-ODEIZ's<br />\n)c<br />\nLANIOD5-01MfTI:Lok<br />\n<br />\n7r<br />\n<br />\n3.,)04ifibri i'2f tcettolkilianteir A-)zIA i,.<br />\n<br />\nSTAFF<br />\n\u2022 13 7MARKETING<br />\n4 i ISFI alitlisI,<br />\n,R1 r1,-,10<br />\nkA 771)1T-2.,3 ><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 7 ADMINISTRATION<br />\n\u2022<br />\niltMeri kelt, WI.

For \"Old Wives' Tales\"(Rhino 70913; CD,<br />\nLP, and cassette), if anything, tells real wives'<br />\ntales, stories that resonate with the concerns and<br />\neccentricities of genuine lives. From one woman<br />\nand the man who \"carved his initials in her<br />\nuterus\" to the dreaming barmaid with a mind<br />\n\"built for extended thought,\" Cervenka draws<br />\nblack comedy from deep within the well of modern<br />\nblue-collar living.<br />\nBut unlike the working-class protagonists of<br />\nBruce Springsteen, whose tales of working class<br />\nangst have attracted an enormous following, the<br />\npeople in \"Old Wives' Tales\" aren't selfconscious. They have stories to tell, certainly. But<br />\nrather than sit on a porch and recount their lives<br />\nwith stock poignant images, Cervenka's characters<br />\nsay whatever strikes their fancy; their lives practically seep through the lyrics. These fractured,<br />\noddly beautiful people continually rediscover an<br />\nAmerica ridden with problems\u2014their problems\u2014<br />\nthat they cannot escape.<br />\nNot that some of them don't try. At least half<br />\nof the music on \"Old Wives' Tales\" sound designed for the open road\u2014songs made for streaking down the highway with the radio on. When<br />\ncoupled with the barroom jukebox sound of the<br />\nrhythm sections here\u2014where propulsive snare<br />\ndrum whacks float atop easygoing lines\u2014they give<br />\nthe impression of a perpetual road trip, one<br />\nwithout any particular destination.<br />\nThe rest of the songs on \"Old Wives' Tales,\"<br />\nhowever, come through like distress signals from<br />\nthe thoughts of marooned housewives. For these<br />\nwomen, potent daydreams braid through the<br />\ndetails of everyday life until the two are no longer<br />\ndistinct. The narrator in \"Here Come the<br />\nCrucifiers,\" perhaps the record's most polemical<br />\nsong, has reached this point. She speculates on<br />\n<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\n<br />\nExene Cervenka\u2014the lives of her characters practically seep through her lyrics<br />\nwhen the righteous folks of the title\u2014government<br />\nmen, it seems\u2014are coming, and why. \"They'd<br />\nlike to make you worship the State,\" Cervenka<br />\nintones. \"Worship a government God that hates<br />\nus all / A government God made of drugs and<br />\ngold.\" Despite the weight of her words, Cervenka<br />\nsings innocuously against a hollow-sounding<br />\nacoustic guitar, as high-pitched tom-toms rattle<br />\naway like hints of distant thunder.<br />\nMelodramatic as that seems, \"Old Wives'<br />\nTales\" is as occupied with humor as it is with bitterness. Cervenka endows most of her narrators<br />\nwith a streak of honesty at once painful and funny. So adroit is her voice that she seems to cut<br />\nthrough the lyrics\u2014slashing here, snipping along<br />\nthe dotted line there\u2014to the sentiments behind<br />\nthem. In \"She Wanted,\" sung to a bluesy guitar<br />\naccompaniment, Cervenka's narrator surveys the<br />\nstate of the world and concludes that \"the meek<br />\nshall inherit the earth / but by then it won't be<br />\nworth much.\"<br />\nAll this candor would be hard to take were it<br />\nnot for Tony Gilkyson, whose able production<br />\n<br />\nFrank Gargani<br />\n<br />\nframes the songs so attractively that even<br />\nCervenka's ugliest invective is digestible. When<br />\nremoved from the sound of thumping road song,<br />\n\"Old Wives' Tales\" settles for refreshingly spare<br />\ndoses of acoustic and electric guitar, and minimal<br />\nuse of drums. The clever arrangement on<br />\n\"Famous Barmaid,\" a tribute of sorts to the<br />\ncocktail lounge jazz trio, enhances the lyrics in<br />\nan unexpected way. As the narrator rattles off the<br />\ndetails of a barmaid friend's life and ideas, a walking bass line somehow tugs the listener into the<br />\nsong\u2014it's as if one is walking with Cervenka as<br />\nshe speaks\u2014while the wobbly-sounding piano trio<br />\nplays solemnly away.<br />\nInevitably, it is the lyrics that give \"Old Wives'<br />\nTales\" its shape. These songs clearly were built<br />\nfrom the syllables up. Sexual and social politics<br />\nfigure everywhere in Cervenka's writing, from the<br />\nnot-so-romantic series of images in \"White Trash<br />\nWife\" to the undisguised revulsion of \"Gravel,\"<br />\na brief, spoken poem about a Native American<br />\ncouple plotting sabotage on top of Mount<br />\nSee RECORDS, 10<br />\n<br />\nAnd you thought the Billy Joel song was bad.<br />\nThe best thing that can be said about \"An Inocent Man,\" a stale new action-drama starring Tom<br />\nSelleck, is that it has the complexity and intelligence of a made-for-television movie. That's<br />\nnot saying a lot.<br />\nSelleck is triumphant airline mechanic Jimmie<br />\nRainwood, a self-dubbed \"citizen of the universe\"<br />\nwho has the whole airline in his hands, or so it<br />\nseems. He motions jumbo jets into hangars and<br />\ngood-naturedly chides his fellow employees on<br />\ntheir sloppy work habits. As Howard Shore's score<br />\nlilts obnoxiously in the background, \"An Innocent Man\" begins like a commercial for American<br />\nAirlines.<br />\nAfter another long day of making our air<br />\ntransportation system safe, Rainwood is accidentally shot by two crooked DEA agents (David<br />\nRasche and Richard Young) making a bust. The<br />\nagents realize they were given the wrong address<br />\nby a drugged-out informant, so they plant their<br />\nown drugs on Rainwood and arrest him instead.<br />\nRainwood is quickly convicted and sentenced to<br />\nsix years in jail.<br />\nBut these mediocre opening moments look like<br />\nAcademy-Award material compared to the remainder of the film. It's no more than a mixture<br />\nof predictable plot development, poorly writtenr,<br />\ndialogue, and excessive violence.<br />\nDuring the trial, Rainwood commiserates with<br />\nhis wife Kate (Leila Robins) about the frustrations<br />\nof the justice system about to put him in prison.<br />\n\"What the hell is going on,\" he whines, \"when<br />\nthe police can do whatever they like and get away<br />\nwith it?\" It's just desserts for Selleck, considering the share of lawless ruckus-causing he managed for eight years on \"Magnum, P.I.\"<br />\nSee MOVIES, 11<br />\n<br />\nPARENTS' WEEKEND 1989<br />\nMark your calendar and plan to take in some of the festivities<br />\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 20<br />\n8 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nBarnstormer's Production<br />\n\"California Suite\"<br />\n<br />\nShriver Auditorium<br />\n<br />\n8 p.m.&<br />\n10:15 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nMovies: \"Heathers'&<br />\n'Time Bandits'<br />\n<br />\nArellano Theater<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\n<br />\n9:30 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nOpening Night.Reception<br />\n<br />\nClipper Room<br />\n<br />\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 21<br />\n11 a.m. 3p.m.<br />\n<br />\nPhi Psi 500<br />\n<br />\nGilman Quad<br />\n<br />\n4-5 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nChoral Society Concert (Free)<br />\n<br />\nGreat Hall<br />\n<br />\n7:30 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nBarnstormers'Production<br />\n\"California Suite\"<br />\n<br />\nShriver Auditorium<br />\n<br />\n8 p.m.&<br />\n10:15 p.m.<br />\n9 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nMovies: \"Heathers\"<br />\n'Time Bandits\"<br />\nStudent Talent Night<br />\n<br />\nArellano Theater<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nGreat Hall<br />\n<br />\nParents' Weekend is sponsored by the Student Activities Office<br />\n<br />\n\f10/OCTOBER 13, 1989<br />\n<br />\nR EC OR DS<br />\nAttention!

Where most alternative<br />\nbands in the Eighties have turned to synthesizer-based new wave<br />\nor hardcore for an up-to-date image, The Fall has retained its<br />\ntrademark sound and continued to<br />\nexperiment. \"Seminal Live\"<br />\ncomprises one side of new<br />\nmaterial and another of live cuts<br />\nfrom previous albums.<br />\n\"Dead Beat Descendant,\" the<br />\nband's new U.K. single begins<br />\nthe record. It's a fun punk song,<br />\nladen with noisy guitars and the<br />\nslight folk influence that is typical<br />\nof The Fall. The second song carries this folk influence even further. A slow, catchy number, it<br />\nsounds like a British version of<br />\nthe Violent Femmes' \"Blind<br />\nLeading the Naked.\"<br />\nThe third track, \"H.O.W.,\"<br />\nmoves in a different direction: its<br />\ntuneless repetition represents the<br />\npunk influence at its worst.<br />\n\"Mollusc In Tyrol,\" by contrast,<br />\nis boldly experimental; it sounds<br />\nvaguely like industrial music. The<br />\n<br />\nlive B-side is less interesting than<br />\nthe studio tracks, but it is<br />\nnonetheless enjoyable and<br />\ndanceable.<br />\n\u2014Laura Pearl<br />\n<br />\nMarshall Crenshaw\u2014Good<br />\nEvening (Warner Bros.)<br />\nMarshall Crenshaw's music<br />\nhas always skittered along the<br />\nlines that separate clever and<br />\ncutesy. Yet \"Good Evening,\"<br />\nCrenshaw's fifth album in eight<br />\nyears, is a decided step forward:<br />\nit rejects cuteness for lean<br />\nmusicality. The record boasts a<br />\nmixture of cover songs (by<br />\nRichard Thompson, John Hiatt,<br />\nBobby Fuller) and originals<br />\nwhose \"silly love song\" surfaces<br />\nyield deeper, more cynical layers<br />\nof meaning. The rotating cast of<br />\nplayers, despite its imposing wall<br />\nof sound, wastes few notes: the<br />\nbackbeat is firm but subtle, and<br />\nthe guitar solos refreshingly terse.<br />\nOther aspects of\"Good Evening\" are less successful. For one,<br />\nCrenshaw has an inescapably frail<br />\nvoice; the smooth phrasing that<br />\nbolsters his love songs makes his<br />\nfailed-relationship diatribes sound<br />\nlike comedy routines. Occasional<br />\nbubblegum lyrics, too, spoil what<br />\nare otherwise solid songs. But<br />\nwhen this accomplished guitarist<br />\nand his band simply leap into the<br />\npocket and play\u2014no pretensions,<br />\nno fake insights\u2014they reach<br />\nhighs that Crenshaw's earlier<br />\ndisks can't equal.<br />\n\u2014T.H.

There are<br />\nmore important things to do and<br />\nsee when Raintree gets to jail\u2014<br />\nlike gang rapes and human incineration, just for starters.<br />\nStill, one can learn new things<br />\nabout prison life from \"An Innocent Man,\" thanks to experienced screenwriter Larry<br />\nBrothers.<br />\nto<br />\nAccording<br />\nTouchstone Pictures, Brothers<br />\ndropped out of Amherst College<br />\n\"in order to pursue his main interests: drugs and crime. Eventually, he wound up in Los<br />\nAngeles and began working in the<br />\nfilm industry.\"<br />\nIsn't it usually the other way<br />\naround? Doesn't the Writers'<br />\nGuild have a bylaw prohibiting<br />\nhardened criminals from writing<br />\nlousy movies? Jail, it seems, is<br />\nwhere Brothers learned to write.<br />\nBut he should be sent back, never<br />\nallowed to write again, and forced to watch \"An Innocent Man\"<br />\nfor ten to twenty.<br />\nThanks to Brothers, one learns<br />\nthat a warden's first words to new<br />\ninmates are \"let's get naked.\"<br />\nAnd that if you give the warden<br />\nany trouble, he'll \"guarantee you<br />\none long stay in hell.\" Writer<br />\nBrothers may have done time, but<br />\nhis prison dialogue is about as<br />\nrealistic as Wendy 0. Williams'<br />\n\"Reform School for Girls,\"<br />\nwithout the pillowfights.<br />\nIn fact, Brothers sinks any<br />\nchance of credibilty for \"An Innocent Man.\" F. Murray<br />\nAbraham, who won an Academy<br />\nAward for his work in<br />\n\"Amadeus,\" at first appears to<br />\nbe horribly miscast here as Virgil<br />\n<br />\nCane, a lifer who befriends Rainwood and teaches him how to survive behind bars. But Abraham<br />\nis a brilliant actor, which only<br />\nmakes the banalities in-Brothers'<br />\nscript all the more egregious. We<br />\nnever find out why Cane is in<br />\nprison, nor why no one in jail<br />\nbothers him, Considering his<br />\nminimal physique. And when<br />\nan actor like Abraham is forced to utter lines like, \"insane<br />\nrules in an insane place, so it all<br />\nends up kind of logical,\" you<br />\nmight feel like killing someone<br />\nyourself.<br />\nAs Rainwood, Selleck is<br />\nstudied, but far from convincing.<br />\nIf he seems at all bewildered, it's<br />\nbecause Brothers gives him no<br />\nroom in which to operate. As annoying as he is, Rainwood is appropriately wimpy in jail, since<br />\nhe must learn survival skills from<br />\nother inmates in the new environment. Yet after being paroled, he<br />\nis continually hassled by the DEA<br />\nagents and his pushy wife; Rainwood doesn't have an original<br />\nthought. And, as we know from Tom Selleck and Laila Robins in \"An Innocent Man\" Gene Trindl<br />\nhis work as an airplane repairman, he's not only an innocent<br />\nman, he's a brilliant man. The transformed while in jail, to lose inevitable and violent finale.<br />\ncharacter goes nowhere.<br />\nhis humanity. But the limitations What was laughable becvome<br />\n\"An Innocent Man\" is a film of the screenplay cramp our in- simply boring, and the film seems<br />\nwith little sense of time.

Later installments will fund investigations<br />\nof glaucoma, cataracts, and other<br />\neye diseases.<br />\nDiabetic retinopathy is one of<br />\nthe most common problems caused by juvenile and adult-onset<br />\ndiabetes. Twenty years ago, Dr.<br />\nAntall Patz, Director Emeritus of<br />\nWilmer, developed an argon laser<br />\nto treat retinopathy. His revolu-<br />\n<br />\ntionary therapy has cut the rate ot<br />\nblindness in diabetes patients in<br />\nhalf.<br />\nPatz's and other newer<br />\ntreatments can only arrest or slow<br />\nthe loss of sight however, not<br />\nrestore what is already gone. And<br />\nwhile the laser treatment<br />\npreserves reading vision, it often<br />\ndestroys peripheral vision and<br />\ncauses night blindness. Ms. Barbara B. Doegen, a diabetic whose<br />\nreading vision was saved by<br />\nPatz's treatment but was left with<br />\nnight blindness and limited<br />\nperipheral vision, summarized<br />\nthe importance of these faculties:<br />\n\"People don't realize what it's<br />\nlike to go down stairs when you<br />\ncan't see them.\" Finally, five<br />\npercent of diabetic retinopathy<br />\npatients have complications that<br />\npreclude laser treatment. Consequently, more research is needed, which the Lions Vision<br />\nResearch Foundation will<br />\n<br />\nsupport.<br />\nThe<br />\nDiabetic<br />\nVision<br />\nRehabilitation Program, the first<br />\nuse of Lions Club funds, will be<br />\na unique facility. It will help<br />\ndiabetes patients deal with everyday problems of low vision and<br />\ndiabetes. A social worker, Ms.<br />\nMarie Leinhaas, will coordinate<br />\npatient's numerous doctor's appointments. Doegen complained,<br />\n\"Your life is spent around office<br />\nvisits.\"<br />\nDr. Roanne Flom discussed<br />\nsome of the technology diabetic<br />\nretinopathy patients will learn to<br />\nuse. Most blood glucose meters<br />\nfor patient use are based on color, and are thus ineffective for patients with low vision. Electronic<br />\nmonitors with large liquid crystal<br />\ndisplays are available, and patients in the program will learn to<br />\nuse them. Low vision patients<br />\nhave trouble measuring their own<br />\ninsulin because the small marks<br />\n<br />\non syringes are difficult to see.<br />\nFlom demonstrated the \"CountA-Dose,\" which clicks every<br />\ntime two units of insulin are<br />\ndrawn into the syringe.<br />\nLions Clubs International has<br />\nhad a special dedication to helping those with vision problems<br />\nsince 1925, when Helen Keller<br />\nasked the group to be \"knights of<br />\nthe blind in the crusade against<br />\ndarkness.\" Individual clubs in<br />\nMultiple District 22 have been<br />\nhelping to support Wilmer Eye<br />\nInstitute for the past decade. Last<br />\nyear, Patz approached the group<br />\nwith a proposal: the entire<br />\ndistrict, united, could greatly advance the cause of the blind by<br />\nfunding a Vision Research Center<br />\nat Wilmer, which has the number<br />\none ranked opthalmology program in the country.

A second<br />\nmodel was made of vitalium, a<br />\nstronger alloy of chrome and<br />\ncobalt. But friction between the<br />\nmetal components shortened their<br />\nlifespan. Surgeons also had no<br />\nsuitable fixative to bond the<br />\ndevice to bone, and consequently both metal prototypes failed<br />\nwithin 3 months.<br />\nFor a fixative, surgeons turn-<br />\n<br />\ned to methymethacryline<br />\n(MMA), long used to repair teeth<br />\nand to patch bone. But, patients<br />\nwho received severe blows to the<br />\njoint suffered inflamed hip joints.<br />\nThe MMA,surgeons found, had<br />\ncrumbled and the tiny particles<br />\nwere irritating the tissues. The<br />\npatients'immune responses were<br />\ncausing swelling and destroying<br />\nhealthy bone.<br />\nMMA was replaced by making.<br />\nthe surface of the prosthesis<br />\nrougher, so that the patient's own<br />\ntissue would grow into the surface, forming a physiological<br />\nbond.<br />\nAdditional innovation replaced<br />\nthe stainless steel socket with a<br />\npolyethylene<br />\ncomponent.<br />\nElimination of the high metalmetal friction coefficient increased patient comfort and lengthed<br />\nthe life of the prosthesis.

Scientists are unsure of<br />\nhow caffeine works, but think it may compete with<br />\nthe neuromodulator adenosine. Adenosine causes<br />\nsedation. Caffeine holes up in the adenosine receptor to prevent relaxation by adenosine, and exerts<br />\nsome invigorating effects of its own.<br />\nAdenosine is one of the components of DNA. The<br />\nreason that caffeine fits in adenosine's receptor is<br />\nthat the two have similar structures. Just as the<br />\nreceptor can make a mistake, so can DNAsynthesizing proteins. Caffeine may get worked<br />\ninto DNA which.may cause mutations which may<br />\ncause cancer.<br />\nCaffeine is both psychologically and physiologically addictive. Since it is in the same family as cocaine and amphetamines, the addiction mechanism<br />\nfor all three is probably the same or nearly so,<br />\nbut no one knows what it is.<br />\n<br />\nHiesenburger's<br />\nby Joseph Hams<br />\nPLEASE MEET- PRor:<br />\n<br />\nCARL<br />\n<br />\n/6 -fief sruDy of<br />\n<br />\nFRE<br />\n<br />\nAc<br />\n<br />\nVOA/<br />\n<br />\nHI5 INON&OL 114Nn._3.118Arn/j<br />\n<br />\n77AIE<br />\n<br />\nHON,/ ii../kc<br />\nDIfFERElvrt9LEGoAroDA,5, celvik,4;,<br />\nASoAlv LAND<br />\n<br />\n10.4403\u00a3 LW, IS DEDirogrED<br />\n<br />\nli/ESEAlt,URGER<br />\n<br />\nSPACE, klATT-Ef? po\\of<br />\n<br />\nCRoss couovrey<br />\nPILLAC-/Ad(,, AN')<br />\npRe r ry &iktS ,<br />\n<br />\nENV?<br />\n<br />\nr roR6 r<br />\n<br />\nPRETTY<br />\n<br />\nGIRts<br />\n<br />\nPi_ERsE<br />\n<br />\nAND .UM...<br />\nPR ETTY GIRL S<br />\n<br />\n4'j&(<br />\n<br />\nH15 Loats is AT A FAMov,5 EASTERN UNIVEWSITY.<br />\nIT'S NOT \"5t,61<br />\nBY THE WAY,<br />\nwviIN T.5 THE<br />\n<br />\nSPFicf PONE foR ?<br />\n<br />\nSPAcC<br />\n<br />\nsa-P.<br />\n<br />\n4:y<br />\n<br />\n11 Hfi5 Huai Ti-ANER TRANS<br />\nWARP<br />\n<br />\nDi:qv(<br />\n7\u2022C-<br />\n<br />\nGETS 50,000<br />\nLIGHT- YEARS ro A<br />\nGALLON ./<br />\n<br />\nNEXT --rofsDA1<br />\nWE \u2022 RE 'TAKING 'ER<br />\n<br />\nor FoR<br />\n<br />\nDRY OUT-0BiI<br />\n- 7- -1- TY 0 SEVEN P<br />\nHI- ,---RES-MP\\N QUAD<br />\nID BC-EkV4/2<br />\nI E HOP<br />\nAND fl-IE IFC<br />\n<br />\nAJt<br />\n<br />\nSPIN . \u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\ncALL. oc-R Sfimmtm<br />\nTEPoNY<br />\n<br />\n1\\E XT SIR1P ,<br />\nNEoLiTH\u2018C TAM 5,<br />\nMAYHEM in Tifrit pAc...E, CoNNTit..\u2018thANI ,<br />\nFiND MU(/ Mot(<br />\n<br />\n\f,<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nThe Grad Cilut<br />\npresetrts<br />\n<br />\n\"Relatively speaking,<br />\nArtCarved has<br />\ngold.\"<br />\nthe best deal on<br />\n<br />\nFriday the I 31-h<br />\n<br />\nJohnny Monet<br />\nImpressionists<br />\n<br />\n& -the<br />\n<br />\nboth men and women.<br />\nWhat's more, your<br />\nArtCarved gold ring<br />\nIt doesn't take an<br />\n.<br />\n,.-.....___ -.- .-f\u2022 - %<br />\nis so superbly<br />\n\u2022<br />\n- ...\u2022<br />\n--\"<br />\nEinstein to figure<br />\nprotected<br />\ncrafted<br />\nit's<br />\n`:-.\u2022 1.<br />\n' '<br />\nout now's the time<br />\n.- '<br />\n-14,<br />\nn\u2018<br />\ni<br />\n:<br />\n.,7*.\u2022 \u2022 '''<br />\nby a Full Lifetime<br />\nto buy your collegeutr ..<br />\n,<br />\nWarranty Now's the<br />\n-T0<br />\n4<br />\nring.

The first waiver occurred when<br />\nChinese graduate students presented us with a letter in<br />\nreference to a planned protest in Washington. Fearful of<br />\npossible retribution against themselves or their families,<br />\nthese students requested anonymity. There could be little<br />\nquestion that they were indeed in danger so, under what<br />\nwe considered to be exceptional circumstances, the NewsLetter agreed to withold names.<br />\nIt is to our great embarrassment that we feel compelled<br />\na second time to withhold the name of a letter writer in order<br />\nto protect them from retribution. Our feelings of regret<br />\nstem not from our action but from its cause; this member<br />\nof the Hopkins community does not fear retaliation from<br />\na foreign government, but from the Hopkins community,<br />\nspecifically those involved with the fraternity system.<br />\nThe relevant letter, which appears on this page, addresses the role played by fraternities in fostering substance<br />\nabuse through institutionalized peer pressure in that most<br />\npervasive of Hopkins social institutions, the Greeks. While<br />\nthe majority of fraternity members are undoubtedly sufficiently mature and confident in the value of their institutions to allow such a letter to stand, without feeling compelled to respond with intimidation, individual precedent<br />\nhas not been encouraging.<br />\nOver the past five years, there have been numerous examples of deplorable behavior on the part of individual<br />\nfraternity members, acting presumably out of a perverted<br />\nsense of loyalty to their chapters, to leave us concerned.<br />\nThe burning down, in 1986, of shanties constructed by the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa by members of Delta<br />\nUpsilon\u2014an incident which resulted in criminal<br />\nprosecution \u2014and the assault, in 1988, of a visiting female<br />\nstudent by a Tau Epsilon Phi freshman pledge (apparently acting out a misunderstood pledge task) come to mind.<br />\nA writer overtly critical of the Greek system can hardly<br />\nbe blamed for feeling afraid.<br />\nWhat this amounts to is that any aspirations for a<br />\ntolerant, intellectually vibrant campus are threatened at the<br />\nroots. When legitimate fear of physical or emotional harrassment is pervasive enough to restrict the free exchange<br />\nof ideas, we are no longer fulfilling our role as either an<br />\ninstitution of higher learning, or as a democratic community. The fear in question is real, and should not be dismissed<br />\nby those who, consciously or not, perceive themselves in<br />\na position of strength.<br /><br />\nAlthough the situaton at hand concerns the fraternity<br />\nsystem, we believe the problem of intolerance to be too<br />\nimportant to blame on any one segment of Homewood;<br />\nthe responsibility for its resolution lies with us all. It is<br />\ntime for all of us to reevaluate our behavior and feelings<br />\ntowards those who may not belong to our own private corner of Hopkins and the world in general.<br />\nUntil then, we deplore a \"human climate\" in which a<br />\nwriter need fear for their peace within the Hopkins community for having perceived flaws in the fraternity system,<br />\nand suggested what they consider to be an appropriate<br />\nresolution. The News-Letter, as a member of the<br />\nHomewood community, is embarrassed and ashamed to<br />\nconcur that such a fear is justifiable.<br /><br />\nPoor judgement<br /><br />\nThe Office of Residential life announced last week that<br />\nSenior Tom Brennan had been selected to assume the<br />\nhousemaster position in Building B left vacant by the departure of Jenifer Willmann.

It is<br />\nwhen these \"newly emancipated\" students are completely in control of their life's decisions that his or her environment<br />\nand peer pressure from fellow<br />\nstudents play into abuse.

I need go<br />\nno further into this, since June<br />\n1988's Physics Today has a pretty good article about it.<br />\nMy proposal ;s that maybe<br />\nscientists should actually go about<br />\ntaking over the plane; The public<br />\nperception already bting One of<br />\npower-hungry antisocia lunatics,<br />\nwe've got nothing to lo:e there.<br />\nJust make the perceptior, true.<br />\nIn fact, in a human environment getting more irratioral by<br />\nthe minute, rationality woulo give<br />\nus a definite advantage. So we<br />\ncan have a reasonable expectation<br />\nof being able to pull this off, plus<br />\nof being able to stay in power<br />\npretty much forever if we do<br />\nthings right. There should be absolutely no doubt in any reader's<br />\nmind that we could do a better job<br />\nof running things than our<br /><br />\nrange in Oregon and Washington,<br />\nthe Sierras in California, and the<br />\nRockies farther north in Colorado. Since the area is fortunate<br />\nenough to be free of national<br />\nparks, it does not draw a<br />\ndisproportionate number of<br />\ntourists like western Wyoming<br />\n(Yellowstone/Grand Teton). Like<br />\nYellowstone, some areas of the<br />\nCarson National Forest near the<br />\nColorado/New Mexico border<br />\nhave large elk herds. This is supposedly one of the best elk hunting grounds in the nation. I've<br />\nbeen told that an organization<br />\nwhich owns a large tract of land<br />\nadjacent to the national forest<br />\ncharges people $5000 a day to<br />\nhunt elk on their land. And people must pay it if they charge that<br />\nmuch. It's a playground of the<br />\nsuper-wealthy. Along with elk,<br />\nthis region is home to numerous<br />\ncoyotes, bears, deer, and even a<br />\nfew mountain lions. Combine all<br />\nthese features of the landscape<br />\nwith the fact that there are few if<br />\nany mosquitos, the August high<br />\ntemperatures are around 75<br />\ndegrees with low humidity, and<br />\nyou have a perfect place to do<br />\ngeology research. I guess one<br />\ncould ask for a greater exposure<br /><br />\nof rocks, buf this would mean<br />\nfewer trees and meadows. I can't<br />\nthink of many better places to<br />\nspend three weeks in late July and<br />\nearly August, as I did this year.<br />\nTo anyone who is in search of a<br />\nwonderful vacation next summer,<br />\nmy advice is to explore Santa Fe<br />\nand the surrounding areas of NM.<br />\nMy time there was spent<br />\nwandering through woods looking for rock exposures and collecting samples, which was not<br />\nalways a pleasure.

But it's not too hard<br />\nto understand why he wanted to<br />\ndo this; it wasn't just camping in<br />\nthe woods.

It happened in New<br />\nMexico, also known as the Land<br />\nof Enchantment. Somebody knew<br />\nwhat he was doing when he gave<br />\nit this name. For most people,<br />\nmyself included, the state of New<br />\nMexico is associated with visions<br />\nof a flat, searing, cactus and<br />\nsagebrush-filled landscape. At<br />\nleast until one pays a visit. There<br />\nis a good portion of the landscape<br />\nwhich closely matches the frequently imagined view of the<br />\nestate, much of it over near the<br />\nTexas border. But many fail to<br />\nrealize that the Rocky Mountains<br />\nextend down from Colorado into<br />\nnorth central New Mexico. High<br />\nelevations (up to 13,000 feet)<br />\ncombined with more southern<br />\nlatitude make for some tremendous forests of pine, fir, and<br />\naspen trees, along with plenty of<br />\nlush green meadows. Precipitation levels are fairly high, so<br />\nmountain streams are plentiful.<br />\nBecause there are no large<br />\npopulation centers nearby, the<br />\nforests and meadows see fewer<br />\npeople, thus less damage, than the<br />\nlegendary forests of the Cascade<br /><br />\na581/11V AUJANCe's-TRATEGY 5555/04;<br />\nWeruc<br />\nweo/VG curr-H Val?<br />\nRESAVID<br />\nro 5-ruces- OF Al4A9kE77NG- TEcfAliQuEr.

One afternoon<br />\nwe drove down what appeared to<br />\nbe an old logging road, found a<br />\nnice shady area along a small<br />\nstream, and sat for a couple hours<br />\neating lunch and making a dent<br />\nin the beer supply. We talked<br />\nabout life on the east and west<br />\ncoasts and tried to quantify the<br />\ndifferences, but to no avail.

Do<br />\nwhat you can do; you owe<br />\nyourself no less. Your faculty and<br />\nadministration may foster a cutthroat atmosphere that makes talk<br />\nof the reestablishment of an honor<br />\ncode laughable; they may not require that foreign teaching<br />\nassistants learn English; they may<br />\nregard student housing for<br />\nupperclassmen a strategic<br />\nposteriority; they may not even<br />\nbother to show up for their own<br />\nmeetings to address student concerns; but it is still your school<br />\nand your community.

The welltrained housemaster of Clark instinctively presented a pair of<br />\nerect fingers.

He answered some<br />\nimportant questions, such as what<br />\nto do if a condom breaks; Women<br />\nshould apply extra nonoxynolcontaining spermicide and douche<br />\nrepeatedly with warm water. If<br />\ntheir partner complains that their<br />\n\"organ\" is too small, men should<br />\nreply, \"I'm sorry that my organ<br />\nis too small for your<br />\nauditorium.\" If your partner has<br /><br />\nsigns of venereal disease,<br />\n\"vomit, faint, do whatever you<br />\nhave to do to avoid having sex.\"<br />\nGoettel offered a test to find out<br />\nif you're really in love.

This week it's time for<br />\nsome main dish ideas with that<br />\nall-American favorite: hamburger<br />\nhamburger.<br />\nContrary to its bad reputation<br />\nin these cholesterol and red-meat<br />\nwary days, hamburger is not bad<br />\nfor you, as long as you cook it<br />\nproperly and don't eat it every<br />\nday.<br />\nLike most meats, there are different kinds of hamburger. Plain<br />\nground beef contains the most fat;<br />\nground chuck and ground round<br />\ncontain less. Giant carries lean<br />\nand extra lean ground beef as<br />\nwell.<br />\nExtra lean ground beef or<br />\nground round is the best to buy.<br />\nExtra lean costs the same per<br />\npound as regular ground beef;<br />\nground round is a little more expensive, so watch for sale prices.<br />\nA good price for ground round is<br />\n$1.99/1b. or less.<br />\nWith these leaner ground meats<br />\nyou get more for your money<br />\nbecause less of the weight cooks<br /><br />\noff as fat. Their lower fat content<br />\nalso makes them more nutritious.<br />\nYou can safely refrigerate hamburger for 1-2 days. Store it in the<br />\ncoldest part of your refrigerator.<br />\nFreezing it will allow you to store<br />\nit for a month or two. Put the<br />\nunopened package into a plastic<br />\nbag and freeze it.<br />\nThawing should be done in<br />\nyour microwave or refrigerator.<br />\nLeaving it out on the counter to<br />\nthaw increases the chances of<br />\nfood poisoning. Follow your<br />\nmicrowave thawing directions.<br />\nFor refrigerator thawing, put the<br />\nfrozen meat in the refrigerator the<br />\nnight before you plan to use it,<br />\nbut DO NOT refreeze the thawed, uncooked meat. You can also<br />\ncook the frozen meat straight, but<br />\nit will take a little longer.<br />\nYou can microwave ground<br />\nbeef. Follow the instructions in<br />\nyour microwave book.<br />\nFor cooking it on the stove use<br />\na large skillet, a sauce pan. Cook<br />\nthe meat until the surface is completely brown. This is called<br />\nbrowning. Stir the meat often<br />\nwhile you are cooking to keep it<br /><br />\nfrom burning.<br />\nTo drain the grease, follow<br />\nthese steps.<br />\nI. Brown the meat thoroughly.<br />\n2. Turn off the burner.<br />\n3. Scrape the meat over to one<br />\nside and tilt the pan or skillet so<br />\nfat drains to the other side.<br />\n4. Spoon the hot fat into an<br />\nempty metal can. NEVER,<br />\nNEVER, NEVER pour grease<br />\ndown the drain, because you will<br />\nget a clogged drain and your<br />\nlandlord will not be happy.<br />\n5. If your pan is small, you can<br />\nput a triple layer of paper towels<br />\non a plate and dump the cooked<br />\nmeat onto the plate. The towels<br />\nwill absorb a lot of the grease.<br />\nNow that you've cooked and<br />\ndrained your ground beef, it's<br />\ntime to make it into a meal. An<br />\neasy choice is to simply add<br />\nspaghetti sauce and perhaps some<br />\nchopped onion and/or green pepper. A good amount is one<br />\nmedium onion and one medium<br />\ngreen pepper.<br />\nHowever, there is life beyond<br />\nspaghetti.<br />\nAn easy, but not really cheap,<br /><br />\nSt.Paul Cleaners<br />\n3120 St.<br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAY CLEANING AND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRING<br /><br />\n10% discount on all dry cleaning<br />\nexpires 10/27/89<br /><br />\nCAREER<br /><br />\n\u2022 1 R&amp;D ENGINEER<br />\n2 TECHNICAL SUPPORT ENGINEER<br /><br />\n788-4400<br /><br />\n[4:0<br /><br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n8 30-5 00p Ill<br /><br />\nVISA<br />\n) MEM<br /><br />\n5602 Baltimore National Pike *600<br /><br /><br />\nOPPORTUNITIES<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nMY'f4CDSUN<br /><br />\nIN<br /><br />\nJAPAN<br /><br />\nSUNIg5911VcOWS( \u2014---- -'3 %)?&lt; ---JJ \u2014 Z'10<br /><br />\nS'YO1Wilia'gtcL4AtLitZ._1.<br /><br />\n;%51LC,<br />\n'itttt%6<br />\n1 01*<br />\nL''tMODSCIVAI)c13E41,7_5ttLI%-liME13-C2l- \u2014<br />\nEi*meru<br />\n4-0<br />\n7730%1-,L.L667') r\u2014y,fkor21s,, SUNIg-f-ODEIZ's<br />\n)c<br />\nLANIOD5-01MfTI:Lok<br /><br />\n7r<br /><br />\n3.,)04ifibri i'2f tcettolkilianteir A-)zIA i,.<br /><br />\nSTAFF<br />\n\u2022 13 7MARKETING<br />\n4 i ISFI alitlisI,<br />\n,R1 r1,-,10<br />\nkA 771)1T-2.,3 &gt;<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 7 ADMINISTRATION<br />\n\u2022<br />\niltMeri kelt, WI.

For \"Old Wives' Tales\"(Rhino 70913; CD,<br />\nLP, and cassette), if anything, tells real wives'<br />\ntales, stories that resonate with the concerns and<br />\neccentricities of genuine lives. From one woman<br />\nand the man who \"carved his initials in her<br />\nuterus\" to the dreaming barmaid with a mind<br />\n\"built for extended thought,\" Cervenka draws<br />\nblack comedy from deep within the well of modern<br />\nblue-collar living.<br />\nBut unlike the working-class protagonists of<br />\nBruce Springsteen, whose tales of working class<br />\nangst have attracted an enormous following, the<br />\npeople in \"Old Wives' Tales\" aren't selfconscious. They have stories to tell, certainly. But<br />\nrather than sit on a porch and recount their lives<br />\nwith stock poignant images, Cervenka's characters<br />\nsay whatever strikes their fancy; their lives practically seep through the lyrics. These fractured,<br />\noddly beautiful people continually rediscover an<br />\nAmerica ridden with problems\u2014their problems\u2014<br />\nthat they cannot escape.<br />\nNot that some of them don't try. At least half<br />\nof the music on \"Old Wives' Tales\" sound designed for the open road\u2014songs made for streaking down the highway with the radio on. When<br />\ncoupled with the barroom jukebox sound of the<br />\nrhythm sections here\u2014where propulsive snare<br />\ndrum whacks float atop easygoing lines\u2014they give<br />\nthe impression of a perpetual road trip, one<br />\nwithout any particular destination.<br />\nThe rest of the songs on \"Old Wives' Tales,\"<br />\nhowever, come through like distress signals from<br />\nthe thoughts of marooned housewives. For these<br />\nwomen, potent daydreams braid through the<br />\ndetails of everyday life until the two are no longer<br />\ndistinct. The narrator in \"Here Come the<br />\nCrucifiers,\" perhaps the record's most polemical<br />\nsong, has reached this point. She speculates on<br /><br />\nby Mark Friedman<br /><br />\nExene Cervenka\u2014the lives of her characters practically seep through her lyrics<br />\nwhen the righteous folks of the title\u2014government<br />\nmen, it seems\u2014are coming, and why. \"They'd<br />\nlike to make you worship the State,\" Cervenka<br />\nintones. \"Worship a government God that hates<br />\nus all / A government God made of drugs and<br />\ngold.\" Despite the weight of her words, Cervenka<br />\nsings innocuously against a hollow-sounding<br />\nacoustic guitar, as high-pitched tom-toms rattle<br />\naway like hints of distant thunder.<br />\nMelodramatic as that seems, \"Old Wives'<br />\nTales\" is as occupied with humor as it is with bitterness. Cervenka endows most of her narrators<br />\nwith a streak of honesty at once painful and funny. So adroit is her voice that she seems to cut<br />\nthrough the lyrics\u2014slashing here, snipping along<br />\nthe dotted line there\u2014to the sentiments behind<br />\nthem. In \"She Wanted,\" sung to a bluesy guitar<br />\naccompaniment, Cervenka's narrator surveys the<br />\nstate of the world and concludes that \"the meek<br />\nshall inherit the earth / but by then it won't be<br />\nworth much.\"<br />\nAll this candor would be hard to take were it<br />\nnot for Tony Gilkyson, whose able production<br /><br />\nFrank Gargani<br /><br />\nframes the songs so attractively that even<br />\nCervenka's ugliest invective is digestible. When<br />\nremoved from the sound of thumping road song,<br />\n\"Old Wives' Tales\" settles for refreshingly spare<br />\ndoses of acoustic and electric guitar, and minimal<br />\nuse of drums. The clever arrangement on<br />\n\"Famous Barmaid,\" a tribute of sorts to the<br />\ncocktail lounge jazz trio, enhances the lyrics in<br />\nan unexpected way. As the narrator rattles off the<br />\ndetails of a barmaid friend's life and ideas, a walking bass line somehow tugs the listener into the<br />\nsong\u2014it's as if one is walking with Cervenka as<br />\nshe speaks\u2014while the wobbly-sounding piano trio<br />\nplays solemnly away.<br />\nInevitably, it is the lyrics that give \"Old Wives'<br />\nTales\" its shape. These songs clearly were built<br />\nfrom the syllables up. Sexual and social politics<br />\nfigure everywhere in Cervenka's writing, from the<br />\nnot-so-romantic series of images in \"White Trash<br />\nWife\" to the undisguised revulsion of \"Gravel,\"<br />\na brief, spoken poem about a Native American<br />\ncouple plotting sabotage on top of Mount<br />\nSee RECORDS, 10<br /><br />\nAnd you thought the Billy Joel song was bad.<br />\nThe best thing that can be said about \"An Inocent Man,\" a stale new action-drama starring Tom<br />\nSelleck, is that it has the complexity and intelligence of a made-for-television movie. That's<br />\nnot saying a lot.<br />\nSelleck is triumphant airline mechanic Jimmie<br />\nRainwood, a self-dubbed \"citizen of the universe\"<br />\nwho has the whole airline in his hands, or so it<br />\nseems. He motions jumbo jets into hangars and<br />\ngood-naturedly chides his fellow employees on<br />\ntheir sloppy work habits. As Howard Shore's score<br />\nlilts obnoxiously in the background, \"An Innocent Man\" begins like a commercial for American<br />\nAirlines.<br />\nAfter another long day of making our air<br />\ntransportation system safe, Rainwood is accidentally shot by two crooked DEA agents (David<br />\nRasche and Richard Young) making a bust. The<br />\nagents realize they were given the wrong address<br />\nby a drugged-out informant, so they plant their<br />\nown drugs on Rainwood and arrest him instead.<br />\nRainwood is quickly convicted and sentenced to<br />\nsix years in jail.<br />\nBut these mediocre opening moments look like<br />\nAcademy-Award material compared to the remainder of the film.

Both suggest hints<br />\nof modern pop. But Exene of Stevie Wonder and the Beatles,<br />\nCervenka seems to know that her fused with a seductive electronic<br />\nmaterial needs bold, colorful tinge.<br />\nBut the dominant force on this<br />\npackaging.

Where most alternative<br />\nbands in the Eighties have turned to synthesizer-based new wave<br />\nor hardcore for an up-to-date image, The Fall has retained its<br />\ntrademark sound and continued to<br />\nexperiment. \"Seminal Live\"<br />\ncomprises one side of new<br />\nmaterial and another of live cuts<br />\nfrom previous albums.<br />\n\"Dead Beat Descendant,\" the<br />\nband's new U.K. single begins<br />\nthe record. It's a fun punk song,<br />\nladen with noisy guitars and the<br />\nslight folk influence that is typical<br />\nof The Fall. The second song carries this folk influence even further. A slow, catchy number, it<br />\nsounds like a British version of<br />\nthe Violent Femmes' \"Blind<br />\nLeading the Naked.\"<br />\nThe third track, \"H.O.W.,\"<br />\nmoves in a different direction: its<br />\ntuneless repetition represents the<br />\npunk influence at its worst.<br />\n\"Mollusc In Tyrol,\" by contrast,<br />\nis boldly experimental; it sounds<br />\nvaguely like industrial music.

Yet \"Good Evening,\"<br />\nCrenshaw's fifth album in eight<br />\nyears, is a decided step forward:<br />\nit rejects cuteness for lean<br />\nmusicality. The record boasts a<br />\nmixture of cover songs (by<br />\nRichard Thompson, John Hiatt,<br />\nBobby Fuller) and originals<br />\nwhose \"silly love song\" surfaces<br />\nyield deeper, more cynical layers<br />\nof meaning. The rotating cast of<br />\nplayers, despite its imposing wall<br />\nof sound, wastes few notes: the<br />\nbackbeat is firm but subtle, and<br />\nthe guitar solos refreshingly terse.<br />\nOther aspects of\"Good Evening\" are less successful. For one,<br />\nCrenshaw has an inescapably frail<br />\nvoice; the smooth phrasing that<br />\nbolsters his love songs makes his<br />\nfailed-relationship diatribes sound<br />\nlike comedy routines. Occasional<br />\nbubblegum lyrics, too, spoil what<br />\nare otherwise solid songs.

Eventually, he wound up in Los<br />\nAngeles and began working in the<br />\nfilm industry.\"<br />\nIsn't it usually the other way<br />\naround? Doesn't the Writers'<br />\nGuild have a bylaw prohibiting<br />\nhardened criminals from writing<br />\nlousy movies? Jail, it seems, is<br />\nwhere Brothers learned to write.<br />\nBut he should be sent back, never<br />\nallowed to write again, and forced to watch \"An Innocent Man\"<br />\nfor ten to twenty.<br />\nThanks to Brothers, one learns<br />\nthat a warden's first words to new<br />\ninmates are \"let's get naked.\"<br />\nAnd that if you give the warden<br />\nany trouble, he'll \"guarantee you<br />\none long stay in hell.\" Writer<br />\nBrothers may have done time, but<br />\nhis prison dialogue is about as<br />\nrealistic as Wendy 0. Williams'<br />\n\"Reform School for Girls,\"<br />\nwithout the pillowfights.<br />\nIn fact, Brothers sinks any<br />\nchance of credibilty for \"An Innocent Man.\" F. Murray<br />\nAbraham, who won an Academy<br />\nAward for his work in<br />\n\"Amadeus,\" at first appears to<br />\nbe horribly miscast here as Virgil<br /><br />\nCane, a lifer who befriends Rainwood and teaches him how to survive behind bars. But Abraham<br />\nis a brilliant actor, which only<br />\nmakes the banalities in-Brothers'<br />\nscript all the more egregious. We<br />\nnever find out why Cane is in<br />\nprison, nor why no one in jail<br />\nbothers him, Considering his<br />\nminimal physique. And when<br />\nan actor like Abraham is forced to utter lines like, \"insane<br />\nrules in an insane place, so it all<br />\nends up kind of logical,\" you<br />\nmight feel like killing someone<br />\nyourself.<br />\nAs Rainwood, Selleck is<br />\nstudied, but far from convincing.<br />\nIf he seems at all bewildered, it's<br />\nbecause Brothers gives him no<br />\nroom in which to operate. As annoying as he is, Rainwood is appropriately wimpy in jail, since<br />\nhe must learn survival skills from<br />\nother inmates in the new environment. Yet after being paroled, he<br />\nis continually hassled by the DEA<br />\nagents and his pushy wife; Rainwood doesn't have an original<br />\nthought. And, as we know from Tom Selleck and Laila Robins in \"An Innocent Man\" Gene Trindl<br />\nhis work as an airplane repairman, he's not only an innocent<br />\nman, he's a brilliant man.

Later installments will fund investigations<br />\nof glaucoma, cataracts, and other<br />\neye diseases.<br />\nDiabetic retinopathy is one of<br />\nthe most common problems caused by juvenile and adult-onset<br />\ndiabetes. Twenty years ago, Dr.<br />\nAntall Patz, Director Emeritus of<br />\nWilmer, developed an argon laser<br />\nto treat retinopathy. His revolu-<br /><br />\ntionary therapy has cut the rate ot<br />\nblindness in diabetes patients in<br />\nhalf.<br />\nPatz's and other newer<br />\ntreatments can only arrest or slow<br />\nthe loss of sight however, not<br />\nrestore what is already gone. And<br />\nwhile the laser treatment<br />\npreserves reading vision, it often<br />\ndestroys peripheral vision and<br />\ncauses night blindness. Ms. Barbara B. Doegen, a diabetic whose<br />\nreading vision was saved by<br />\nPatz's treatment but was left with<br />\nnight blindness and limited<br />\nperipheral vision, summarized<br />\nthe importance of these faculties:<br />\n\"People don't realize what it's<br />\nlike to go down stairs when you<br />\ncan't see them.\" Finally, five<br />\npercent of diabetic retinopathy<br />\npatients have complications that<br />\npreclude laser treatment. Consequently, more research is needed, which the Lions Vision<br />\nResearch Foundation will<br /><br />\nsupport.<br />\nThe<br />\nDiabetic<br />\nVision<br />\nRehabilitation Program, the first<br />\nuse of Lions Club funds, will be<br />\na unique facility.

Doegen complained,<br />\n\"Your life is spent around office<br />\nvisits.\"<br />\nDr. Roanne Flom discussed<br />\nsome of the technology diabetic<br />\nretinopathy patients will learn to<br />\nuse. Most blood glucose meters<br />\nfor patient use are based on color, and are thus ineffective for patients with low vision. Electronic<br />\nmonitors with large liquid crystal<br />\ndisplays are available, and patients in the program will learn to<br />\nuse them. Low vision patients<br />\nhave trouble measuring their own<br />\ninsulin because the small marks<br /><br />\non syringes are difficult to see.<br />\nFlom demonstrated the \"CountA-Dose,\" which clicks every<br />\ntime two units of insulin are<br />\ndrawn into the syringe.<br />\nLions Clubs International has<br />\nhad a special dedication to helping those with vision problems<br />\nsince 1925, when Helen Keller<br />\nasked the group to be \"knights of<br />\nthe blind in the crusade against<br />\ndarkness.\" Individual clubs in<br />\nMultiple District 22 have been<br />\nhelping to support Wilmer Eye<br />\nInstitute for the past decade. Last<br />\nyear, Patz approached the group<br />\nwith a proposal: the entire<br />\ndistrict, united, could greatly advance the cause of the blind by<br />\nfunding a Vision Research Center<br />\nat Wilmer, which has the number<br />\none ranked opthalmology program in the country.

A second<br />\nmodel was made of vitalium, a<br />\nstronger alloy of chrome and<br />\ncobalt. But friction between the<br />\nmetal components shortened their<br />\nlifespan. Surgeons also had no<br />\nsuitable fixative to bond the<br />\ndevice to bone, and consequently both metal prototypes failed<br />\nwithin 3 months.<br />\nFor a fixative, surgeons turn-<br /><br />\ned to methymethacryline<br />\n(MMA), long used to repair teeth<br />\nand to patch bone. But, patients<br />\nwho received severe blows to the<br />\njoint suffered inflamed hip joints.<br />\nThe MMA,surgeons found, had<br />\ncrumbled and the tiny particles<br />\nwere irritating the tissues.

Scientists are unsure of<br />\nhow caffeine works, but think it may compete with<br />\nthe neuromodulator adenosine. Adenosine causes<br />\nsedation. Caffeine holes up in the adenosine receptor to prevent relaxation by adenosine, and exerts<br />\nsome invigorating effects of its own.<br />\nAdenosine is one of the components of DNA. The<br />\nreason that caffeine fits in adenosine's receptor is<br />\nthat the two have similar structures. Just as the<br />\nreceptor can make a mistake, so can DNAsynthesizing proteins. Caffeine may get worked<br />\ninto DNA which.may cause mutations which may<br />\ncause cancer.<br />\nCaffeine is both psychologically and physiologically addictive. Since it is in the same family as cocaine and amphetamines, the addiction mechanism<br />\nfor all three is probably the same or nearly so,<br />\nbut no one knows what it is.<br /><br />\nHiesenburger's<br />\nby Joseph Hams<br />\nPLEASE MEET- PRor:<br /><br />\nCARL<br /><br />\n/6 -fief sruDy of<br /><br />\nFRE<br /><br />\nAc<br /><br />\nVOA/<br /><br />\nHI5 INON&amp;OL 114Nn._3.118Arn/j<br /><br />\n77AIE<br /><br />\nHON,/ ii../kc<br />\nDIfFERElvrt9LEGoAroDA,5, celvik,4;,<br />\nASoAlv LAND<br /><br />\n10.4403\u00a3 LW, IS DEDirogrED<br /><br />\nli/ESEAlt,URGER<br /><br />\nSPACE, klATT-Ef? po\\of<br /><br />\nCRoss couovrey<br />\nPILLAC-/Ad(,, AN')<br />\npRe r ry &amp;iktS ,<br /><br />\nENV?<br /><br />\nr roR6 r<br /><br />\nPRETTY<br /><br />\nGIRts<br /><br />\nPi_ERsE<br /><br />\nAND .UM...<br />\nPR ETTY GIRL S<br /><br />\n4'j&amp;(<br /><br />\nH15 Loats is AT A FAMov,5 EASTERN UNIVEWSITY.<br />\nIT'S NOT \"5t,61<br />\nBY THE WAY,<br />\nwviIN T.5 THE<br /><br />\nSPFicf PONE foR ?<br /><br />\nSPAcC<br /><br />\nsa-P.<br /><br />\n4:y<br /><br />\n11 Hfi5 Huai Ti-ANER TRANS<br />\nWARP<br /><br />\nDi:qv(<br />\n7\u2022C-<br /><br />\nGETS 50,000<br />\nLIGHT- YEARS ro A<br />\nGALLON ./<br /><br />\nNEXT --rofsDA1<br />\nWE \u2022 RE 'TAKING 'ER<br /><br />\nor FoR<br /><br />\nDRY OUT-0BiI<br />\n- 7- -1- TY 0 SEVEN P<br />\nHI- ,---RES-MP\\N QUAD<br />\nID BC-EkV4/2<br />\nI E HOP<br />\nAND fl-IE IFC<br /><br />\nAJt<br /><br />\nSPIN . \u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\ncALL. oc-R Sfimmtm<br />\nTEPoNY<br /><br />\n1\\E XT SIR1P ,<br />\nNEoLiTH\u2018C TAM 5,<br />\nMAYHEM in Tifrit pAc...E, CoNNTit..\u2018thANI ,<br />\nFiND MU(/ Mot(<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nThe Grad Cilut<br />\npresetrts<br /><br />\n\"Relatively speaking,<br />\nArtCarved has<br />\ngold.\"<br />\nthe best deal on<br /><br />\nFriday the I 31-h<br /><br />\nJohnny Monet<br />\nImpressionists<br /><br />\n&amp; -the<br /><br />\nboth men and women.<br />\nWhat's more, your<br />\nArtCarved gold ring<br />\nIt doesn't take an<br />\n.<br />\n,.-.....___ -.- .-f\u2022 - %<br />\nis so superbly<br />\n\u2022<br />\n- ...\u2022<br />\n--\"<br />\nEinstein to figure<br />\nprotected<br />\ncrafted<br />\nit's<br />\n`:-.\u2022 1.<br />\n' '<br />\nout now's the time<br />\n.- '<br />\n-14,<br />\nn\u2018<br />\ni<br />\n:<br />\n.,7*.\u2022 \u2022 '''<br />\nby a Full Lifetime<br />\nto buy your collegeutr ..<br />\n,<br />\nWarranty Now's the<br />\n-T0<br />\n4<br />\nring.
