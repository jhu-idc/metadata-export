Hammond.<br />\n<br />\nI never thought much of undergraduates until I came more into<br />\ncontact with graduates. To be<br />\nsure, even as undergraduate, I put<br />\nourselves ahead of the forces of<br />\nouter darkness, so that now of all<br />\nspecial classes\u2014and anathema be<br />\nall special classes\u2014the undergraduate becomes the supreme, the capstone of ,an organized civilization.<br />\nAnd this is according to the rights<br />\nof the theory. The business of the<br />\ncollege is education. The schools<br />\nbefore are a preparation for college, and, as someone has said, a,<br />\nsubterfuge for freeing busy parents<br />\nfrom the educating influences of<br />\ntheir juniors. After college, people, as classes, plunge into special<br />\noccupations, or into graduate<br />\nschools which are vocational. They<br />\nmake the great admission,-they are<br />\nreduced to the ranks, the glory of<br />\nthe undergraduate passes from<br />\nthem, and they go to work to enable<br />\ntheir sons to go to college. Education itself a preparation for the<br />\nworld, \"training for efficiency\"\u2014<br />\nweary, stale, flat, and unprofitable<br />\nnonsense, the utter damnableness<br />\nof which is yet to be seen. The<br />\nworld is a preparation for education. Only ultimately is education,<br />\nwith all other things, preparation,<br />\nsince \"he that would scale the<br />\nheights of Heaven must face God.\"<br />\nEducation is the appropriation of<br />\nan atmosphere, the conquest of a<br />\npoint of view, the achievement of<br />\nliberty. Of course, it is not confined within college walls\u2014often<br />\ncannot be found there, class or<br />\ncampus\u2014and one does not have to<br />\nleave his point of view, his atmosphere, his freedom behind when<br />\nhe gets his diploma; but the college<br />\nis the only class explicitly alive with<br />\neducation as aim, and as such is<br />\nsupreme as much within the university as beyond. For graduate<br />\nwork\u2014although in this world of<br />\nthe impossible, education may persist even through seminaries as<br />\nthrough counting-room and church<br />\n\u2014is if anything even more potent<br />\nthan business in annihilating education. Wherefore, lift up your<br />\nheads, 0 ye gates; and be ye lifted<br />\nup, ye everlasting doors; and\u2014enter the football hero.<br />\nIf the college is rightfully to<br />\nwrap itself in its toga of glory, it<br />\nmust be conscious of its senatorial<br />\nrank, and bethink itself of its senatorial duties. In the present college athletics alone are pursued as<br />\nself-justifying, intellectual interests<br />\nare relegated to the possession of<br />\nthe \"nut,\" and courses to the limbo<br />\nof the grind. .The gospel of preparedness, which the undergraduate<br />\nconsciously at least accepts, dis7<br />\ngusts him at least unconsciously<br />\nwith effort which obviously does<br />\nnot prepare; leaves him with a very<br />\nproper lofty superiority to the poor<br />\ngrind who buries himself in such<br />\neffort under the delusion that it<br />\ndoes prepare, or because the in(Continued on page S, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nJohns<br />\nHopkins<br />\nSummer<br />\nCourses<br />\nSixth Session<br />\nJuly 5-Augusi15<br />\n<br />\n1916<br />\n<br />\nGreatly Increased Faculty<br />\n<br />\nGraduate Courses Leading to M.

Dr.<br />\nLatane was the speaker at the first<br />\n\u2022meeting of the Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa at Washington and Lee.<br />\nWith the-forming of the Hopkins<br />\ncircle, his associate membership has<br />\nbeen transferred fiorn Washington<br />\nand Lee to' this University.<br />\n\u00b0thee ',informal talks followed<br />\nDr.. Latane's. Dean Brush spoke<br />\nof the need Which the society filled<br />\nin University life, and asked for its<br />\nco-operation in all matters of Hopkins concern. President Knipp also<br />\nspoke of the part which the society<br />\nshould play in the development of<br />\nUniversity spirit-and in the furtherance of all University undertakings.<br />\nPresent at the initiation ceremonies and the banquet, in addition<br />\nto the new members, were Drs.<br />\nMurray P. Brush, John C. French,<br />\nRalph V. D. Magoffin and Charles<br />\nJ. Tilden as faculty members; Dr.<br />\nJohn H. Latane as associate<br />\nmember, and Myron E. Bagley,<br />\nHiram W. Woodward, Edmund E.<br />\nSpieker, John C. Knipp, Vincent J.<br />\nBrooks and Paul W. Sutton, as<br />\ncharter student members.<br />\n<br />\nWith the informal approval of<br />\nthe Faculty Commit ee on Student<br />\nAffairs, it is now practically certain<br />\nthat, with the exception of the first<br />\nprovision, the new Freshman Regulations proposed by the Junior<br />\nCommittee and passed unanimously<br />\nby the Student Council, will he<br />\nadopted in full.<br />\nThe censored regulation reads as<br />\nfollows: -The Monday following<br />\nthe official opening of the University shall be known as 'ducking<br />\nday,' on which day all freshmen<br />\nshall voluntarily 'duck' or be compelled to 'duck' in the cooling pool<br />\nin the south court at Homewood.\"<br />\nThe chief objection brought up<br />\nby members of the faculty to this<br />\nplan is that it would be beyond all<br />\nhuman nature to expect the freshmen to agree to such a proposal<br />\npeacefully, and that the class conflicts which would inevitably follow any attempts to compel obediance to the rule would invalidate<br />\nthe force of the entire regulations.<br />\nWith this one exception, the concensus of faculty opinion seems to<br />\nbe strongly in favor of the regulations, and while no official action<br />\nhas been taken by the Academic<br />\nCouncil, there exists scarcely any<br />\ndoubt that, when the Class of 1920<br />\nconies to Homewood next fall, it<br />\nwill be forced to obey regulations<br />\nmore stringent than those of any<br />\npreceding year.<br />\nThe regulations will provide,<br />\nfirst, that all freshmen shall wear<br />\nthe official freshmen cap while on<br />\nUniversity property\u2014the cap to be<br />\nhalf black and half blue; second,<br />\nthat freshmen shall wear black<br />\nsocks and neckties until they have<br />\nwon two athletic contests from the<br />\nsophomores; third, that freshmen<br />\nshall not walk on the grass at<br />\nHomewood nor use the steps from<br />\nthe upper quadrangle to the south<br />\ncourt; fourth, that freshmen shall<br />\nbe made to occupy seats in the rooters' section at all games at Homewood Field; fifth, that no freshman shall smoke or wear his hat<br />\nin any University building; sixth,<br />\nthat no freshman shall ride in the<br />\nelevators in any University building: and seventh, that no freshman<br />\nshall wear a letter or any insignia<br />\nof athletic ability won at a preparatory school.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins men will hay,\u2018 special<br />\ninducements to join the various<br />\nmilitary and naval civilian activities<br />\nthis summer. Nearly fifty men<br />\nhave already promised to attend<br />\nthe Plattsburg and Og-lethorpe<br />\ntraining camps, and many others<br />\nare contemplating making the battle-ship cruise offered by the Navy<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nIt has recently been announced<br />\nby the heads of the Engineering<br />\nSchool that a month spent at one<br />\nof the military or naval training<br />\ncamps will be accepted in the place<br />\nof the summer work which has been<br />\nrequired in previous years. This<br />\nwork is not the surveying which is<br />\nnow going on\u2014that still is compulsory. Even the surveying, however, will .be cut short two or three<br />\ndays for the men who wish to attend the student camps at Plattsburg and Oglethorpe. Professor<br />\nTilden, who has taken an active<br />\npart in the military training at Hopkins this spring, is the originator<br />\nof both these plans.<br />\nThe naval training cruise begins<br />\non August 15 and lasts until September 12. The course of training<br />\nis to be given on reserve battleships. The qualifications for enrollment which Hopkins men will<br />\nhave to possess are as follows:<br />\nMust be a citizen of the United<br />\nStates, in good standing and vouched for by at least two reputable<br />\ncitizens whose standings are known<br />\nto the recruiting officer.<br />\nAge 19 to 45, inclusive. Minors<br />\nmust have the consent of parent<br />\nor guardian.<br />\nMust pass a prescribed physical<br />\nexamination.<br />\nPrevious service in the Army,<br />\nNavy or Marine Corps, if any,<br />\nmust have been honorable.<br />\nOn the cruise a portion of the<br />\nday will be given up to the study<br />\nof special subjects, which will 13-e<br />\nlargely optional, so that recruits<br />\nwho have aptitude for or knowledge of such subjects as navigation, signalling, radio work, steam<br />\nor electrical engineering, etc., may<br />\nhave an opportunity to specialize.<br />\nBoat drills will be given 'and landings made, and recruits will be<br />\ntaught the manual of arms and<br />\nmilitary formations. During the<br />\nfinal week of the cruise the ships<br />\nwill return to- the naval districts<br />\nwhence they came, and, in addition<br />\nto the courses of instruction, recruits will be given a general idea<br />\nof their own naval district and its<br />\ndefensive problems.<br />\nAt the expiration of the cruise,<br />\neach recruit will announce his intention as to whether or not he will<br />\nvolunteer for service in the Navy<br />\nin case of war occurring within the<br />\nnext four years.

Yet<br />\nthe difference will, must be, only<br />\nsuperficial. Hopkins can never<br />\nalter or modify the ideals for which<br />\nit has stood since its foundation\u2014<br />\nthat way lies smugness and mediocrity. The cultural endeavor, the<br />\nintellectual contact with the best<br />\nthere is in the University, culminating in the high dreams and firm<br />\nresolves without which a degree<br />\ndegenerates into a title, for which<br />\nall the Hopkins classes of the past<br />\nhave stood, can neither end nor<br />\nvary with a mere change in place.<br />\nThe seniors do indeed represent the<br />\nend of an era, but it is only an era<br />\nof physical restriction; between the<br />\naims of the past and the future<br />\nthere can be no break.<br />\n'Eulogies of graduation are commonplace and meaningless. The<br />\nclass which will graduate tomorrow<br />\nwill not shake the nation with .the<br />\nthunder of its release\u2014it is not<br />\nmeant to. The men whom it will<br />\nsend out into the world do not hold<br />\namong their ranks the learning of<br />\nthe ages, nor the intensified and<br />\n<br />\nsifted ability of a carefully labelled<br />\nintelleCtual aristocracy. Yet the<br />\nseniors whom. Hopkins has produced this year do stand, as Hopkins classes must always stand, for<br />\ntwo all important and all comprehensive things\u2014breadth of appreciation and breadth of purpose.<br />\nA Building for Student Activities.<br />\n<br />\nIn every university there must<br />\nbe one definite locality where student interest in student organizations may come to a head. In the<br />\nhistories of many colleges, such<br />\nlocalities have first been the campus in general, with separate buildings for each organization coming<br />\nas a late and luxurious development. The plan recently proposed<br />\nto convert the present Carroll<br />\nstable at Homewood into a building<br />\nto house all student offices and<br />\nmeeting places steers a middle path<br />\nbetween the two extremes. It seeks<br />\nto furnish means f,or each student<br />\ninterest to follow its own particular line of development with some<br />\nmodicum of centralization rather<br />\nthan for each headquarter to flit<br />\npromiscuously about the college<br />\ngreen; and it comes at a time when<br />\nthe condition of growth into which<br />\nthe University is about to embark<br />\nmakes the provision of such a building, far from a luxury, a necessity.<br />\nThat such a building as the one<br />\nproposed would tend towards the<br />\ndevelopment of Hopkins spirit<br />\namong undergraduates, there can<br />\nhardly be any question. The very<br />\nlife of the University centers about<br />\nits student activities ; the stronger<br />\nthe development of those activities,<br />\nthe greater the cohesion and the<br />\nunity of aim among the student body<br />\nas a whole. Hopkins has no desire<br />\nto so violate its ideals and its tradi-,<br />\ntions as to become an institution<br />\nadvertised with its student life in<br />\ndoub!e headlines and its university<br />\ncurriculum in footnotes ; nor does<br />\nthe proposed plan tend to any such<br />\nresult. It only provides sane and<br />\nnormal opportunities for that college life which makes an institution<br />\nof learning a separate community.<br />\nIt is seldom in the history of<br />\nHopkins that its alumni have been<br />\ncalled upon as a body to contribute<br />\na sum unobtainable in any other<br />\nway; there has not been nor is it<br />\nlikely that there will ever again be<br />\nanother building planned and accomplished by contributions from<br />\nthe entire body of our graduates.<br />\nWe are not a large university, with<br />\na hundred thousand men hanging<br />\nour diploma upon their walls ; in<br />\nnumbers, we are small. Yet there is<br />\na closeness among our students and<br />\nour graduates whichi many another<br />\ninstitution loses because of its very<br />\nsize ; the future of the student activity building could in no way be<br />\nbetter guaranteed than by entrusting its accomplishment entirely to<br />\nthe generosity of the men. who have<br />\nonce felt themselves the need which<br />\nwe are facing today.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nThe Removal to Homewood.<br />\nBy President Frank J. Goodnow.<br />\n<br />\nThe removal of the Philosophical Department of the University<br />\nto the new site at Homewood marks<br />\nthe beginning of the end of the<br />\nmovement which started more than<br />\nten years ago to provide this branch<br />\nof the University with more commodius and attractive quarters.<br />\nWe shall, unfortunately, as probably all interested in the University<br />\nknow, not be able, at present, to<br />\nmake provision at Homewood for<br />\nthe laboratory work in chemistry.<br />\nThe undergraduate lectures in that<br />\nsubject will be given, it is true, at<br />\nthe new site; but the undergraduate laboratory, as well as all the<br />\ngraduate work in chemistry, will be<br />\ncarried on in the present quarters<br />\nof the department.<br />\nMuch of \u2022the work of the University after the move to Homewood- will therefore be carried on<br />\nunder conditions which cannot be<br />\nregarded as ideal. Many of the<br />\nstudents, both graduate and undergraduate, will undoubtedly be put<br />\nto serious inconvenience because of<br />\nthe separation of the Chemical<br />\nLaboratory from the rest of the<br />\nwork of the Philosophical Department. At the same time it is believed that on the whole less inconvenience will be felt by the student body after the removal than<br />\nis experienced now. For it is to<br />\nbe remembered that most of the<br />\nengineering students have, during<br />\nthe past two years, been obliged to<br />\ndo part of their work at the old<br />\nsite and part in the new Engineering Building.<br />\nFurthermore, we shall, until we<br />\nare able to construct one or more<br />\nadditional buildings at the new site,<br />\nbe somewhat crowded in our new<br />\nquarters. The Academic Building, which was intended to house<br />\nmerely the non-scientific departments and the general library, will<br />\nfor the time being have to care as<br />\nwell for zoology and botany, part of<br />\nthe work in psychology and most of<br />\nthe administrative work of the entire University. Physics will share<br />\nwith mechanical and electrical engineering one of the engineering<br />\nbuildings, and geology and civil engineering will both find shelter in<br />\nthe new Civil Engineering Building.<br />\nThe move to Homewood will,<br />\ntherefore, unquestionably present<br />\ndifficult problems. The solution<br />\nreached will undoubtedly in a number of instances not be entirely<br />\nsatisfactory to all those interested.<br />\nThe wisest solution possible cannot<br />\n<br />\nbe made without the exhibition of a<br />\ngreat deal of patience by those concerned. There is, however, no<br />\nreason why, if we all try our best<br />\nto accommodate ourselves to the<br />\nnew conditions, 'we should not be<br />\nable to carry on the work of both<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate departments harmoniously and effectively.<br />\nIndeed, there will unquestionably<br />\nbe many advantages attaching to<br />\nthe work of the University at<br />\nHomewood even under the rather<br />\nunfavorable conditions under which<br />\nit will be inaugurated the coming<br />\nyear\u2014advantages which will become more and more apparent<br />\nafter we have become shaken down<br />\ninto our surroundings.<br />\nWe shall, in the first place;have a<br />\nsense of'permanence which has<br />\nbeen impossible so long as we knew<br />\nthat in all probability we should<br />\nmove in the near future. We shall<br />\ncome very soon to realize that we<br />\nare in what in all probability will<br />\nbe the permanent home of the<br />\nPhilosophical Department of the<br />\nUniversity. We shall surround<br />\nourselves gradually with those incidentals which give an academic atmosphere, but which are impossible<br />\nin a merely temporary home. We<br />\nall, I think, have felt the absence of<br />\nsuch an atmosphere at the old site.<br />\nSituated as we have been in the<br />\nmidst of city life, it was difficult,<br />\nif not impossible, for us to be subjected to many of those influences<br />\nwhich do so much to give the University man the poise, the outlook,<br />\nthe proper sense of values, so necessary for the'really educated man.<br />\nWe shall, in the second place, have<br />\na home of remarkable beauty. The<br />\ngreat natural charm of the Homewood site, with its views, its woods,<br />\nits flowers and its shrubbery, and<br />\nthe artistic buildings, which will<br />\never increase in their attractiveness<br />\nas the architectural plan approaches<br />\nrealization, cannot fail to exert a<br />\ncontinuous if silent and impalpable<br />\ninfluence of the greatest educational<br />\nvalue on us all\u2014teachers as well as<br />\nstudents. If we are able in the<br />\ncoming year to carry through our<br />\nplan .of building at least one dormitory, we shall not only have<br />\nadded .to the attractiveness of the<br />\nHomewood site, but we shall also<br />\nhave strengthened greatly its intangible influence. We hope, if<br />\nthis plan is realized, that the advantages of the Homewood site will<br />\nbe availed of by the students of the<br />\nMedical School. At present about<br />\nall that they know of Homewood is<br />\nthat there is an athletic field there<br />\nwhich only a few of them use.<br />\nWe hope, however, soon to have in<br />\naddition to the field a number of<br />\ntennis courts which will be al:railable to all members of th?, Uni-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, JUNE 12,<br />\n<br />\nCLASS OF 1916<br />\n<br />\n191b.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nBy Courtesy of \"The Hullabaloo.\"<br />\n<br />\nversity.

Yet the very.<br />\nthings which to the outside world<br />\nmight be called handicaps have endeared themselves to a long line of<br />\nHopkins men, and parting from the<br />\nMonument street site comes with a<br />\ndistinct pang to the entire University.<br />\n<br />\nContrary to all forebodings and<br />\nin full accord with the University's'<br />\nfondest hopes, there will be a barber-shop at Homewood, and, what<br />\nis infinitely more important, it wiil<br />\nbe presided over, as it has been<br />\npresided over in the past, by our<br />\nown irreplaceable Walter.<br />\nIt is Walter himself who is the<br />\nmaker of this announcement. The interview was to have been one of condolences and memories; instead, it<br />\nturned on the tonsorial possibilities<br />\nof the new -Academic Building attic.<br />\nHe was not sure, Walter sated<br />\ncautiously\u2014the guarantee of his<br />\nfuture residence had not as yet<br />\nbeen made definite enough for him<br />\nto go the length of moving the<br />\ntreasures of the barber-shop from<br />\ntheir old abode; but he had received<br />\nassurances, he. acknowledged\u2014in<br />\nhis own mind even now there was<br />\nno doubt\u2014and all that really<br />\ntroubled him was the best location<br />\nfor him in the new Homewood<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nThe choice ranges from the basement of the Carroll Mansion to the<br />\npresent corn-crib of the old Carroll<br />\nstable. Walter confided, however,<br />\nthat, at present, the most available site seems to be the aforementioned attic of the Academic<br />\nBuilding. Whatever be his new<br />\nlocation, he stated, every picture<br />\nand souvenir of the present shop<br />\nwill go to Homewood with him.<br />\n<br />\nNext year the Monument street<br />\nbuildings will be vacant. No plans<br />\nhave been made for their disposal,<br />\nthey are merely on sale to the highest bidder. The Geological Building is already partly in the hands<br />\nof the Baltimore City College; that<br />\ninstitution may take over the remainder of the structure once that<br />\nHopkins has finally evacuated. The<br />\npossibilities for the disposal of<br />\nMcCoy Hall are numerous and<br />\nvaried. It may be used as a lecture<br />\nhall, it may be rented as a dancing<br />\nauditorium, or it may be converted<br />\ninto a garage. Yet these are only<br />\n<br />\npossibilities; meanwhile, the corridors will remain bleak and deserted,<br />\nthe bulletin board will present but<br />\na blank stretch of wall, the double<br />\ndoors of the basement will be firmly<br />\nlocked, and the elevator will slowly<br />\nrot upon its moorings.<br />\nAt Homewood, all will be new<br />\nand efficient. There will be no<br />\ntrace or reminder of the present<br />\npostoffice, with its- easy access into<br />\nthe cloak-room and its inevitable<br />\n9 o'clock crowd surging in front<br />\nof the window; instead, in the new<br />\nbasement, there will be a system<br />\nof individual boxes, open at all<br />\ntimes to the holders of the combinations. There will be no more<br />\n<br />\ncrawling journeys from first floor<br />\nto fourth, with the whole rusty lift<br />\nshaking menacingly as each successive foot is gained; at Homewood the elevators will be sure and<br />\nfast and shiny. There will be no<br />\nmore wooden steps worn into hollows on the inside curve by the<br />\nfootsteps of thousands of Hopkins<br />\nmen gone by; it will take long generations to wear hollows in the iron<br />\nstairs of the new Academic Building.<br />\nThe campus of the Hopkins of<br />\nold will soon be gone forever. The<br />\nclasses of the future will learn the<br />\nlore of university ways beneath<br />\ngenerous trees and on velvet lawns,<br />\nnot on curb stones and flags, to<br />\nthe accompaniment of rumbling<br />\nwagons and trolley cars.

Hammond.<br /><br />\nI never thought much of undergraduates until I came more into<br />\ncontact with graduates. To be<br />\nsure, even as undergraduate, I put<br />\nourselves ahead of the forces of<br />\nouter darkness, so that now of all<br />\nspecial classes\u2014and anathema be<br />\nall special classes\u2014the undergraduate becomes the supreme, the capstone of ,an organized civilization.<br />\nAnd this is according to the rights<br />\nof the theory. The business of the<br />\ncollege is education. The schools<br />\nbefore are a preparation for college, and, as someone has said, a,<br />\nsubterfuge for freeing busy parents<br />\nfrom the educating influences of<br />\ntheir juniors. After college, people, as classes, plunge into special<br />\noccupations, or into graduate<br />\nschools which are vocational. They<br />\nmake the great admission,-they are<br />\nreduced to the ranks, the glory of<br />\nthe undergraduate passes from<br />\nthem, and they go to work to enable<br />\ntheir sons to go to college. Education itself a preparation for the<br />\nworld, \"training for efficiency\"\u2014<br />\nweary, stale, flat, and unprofitable<br />\nnonsense, the utter damnableness<br />\nof which is yet to be seen. The<br />\nworld is a preparation for education. Only ultimately is education,<br />\nwith all other things, preparation,<br />\nsince \"he that would scale the<br />\nheights of Heaven must face God.\"<br />\nEducation is the appropriation of<br />\nan atmosphere, the conquest of a<br />\npoint of view, the achievement of<br />\nliberty. Of course, it is not confined within college walls\u2014often<br />\ncannot be found there, class or<br />\ncampus\u2014and one does not have to<br />\nleave his point of view, his atmosphere, his freedom behind when<br />\nhe gets his diploma; but the college<br />\nis the only class explicitly alive with<br />\neducation as aim, and as such is<br />\nsupreme as much within the university as beyond. For graduate<br />\nwork\u2014although in this world of<br />\nthe impossible, education may persist even through seminaries as<br />\nthrough counting-room and church<br />\n\u2014is if anything even more potent<br />\nthan business in annihilating education. Wherefore, lift up your<br />\nheads, 0 ye gates; and be ye lifted<br />\nup, ye everlasting doors; and\u2014enter the football hero.<br />\nIf the college is rightfully to<br />\nwrap itself in its toga of glory, it<br />\nmust be conscious of its senatorial<br />\nrank, and bethink itself of its senatorial duties. In the present college athletics alone are pursued as<br />\nself-justifying, intellectual interests<br />\nare relegated to the possession of<br />\nthe \"nut,\" and courses to the limbo<br />\nof the grind. .The gospel of preparedness, which the undergraduate<br />\nconsciously at least accepts, dis7<br />\ngusts him at least unconsciously<br />\nwith effort which obviously does<br />\nnot prepare; leaves him with a very<br />\nproper lofty superiority to the poor<br />\ngrind who buries himself in such<br />\neffort under the delusion that it<br />\ndoes prepare, or because the in(Continued on page S, col. 3)<br /><br />\nJohns<br />\nHopkins<br />\nSummer<br />\nCourses<br />\nSixth Session<br />\nJuly 5-Augusi15<br /><br />\n1916<br /><br />\nGreatly Increased Faculty<br /><br />\nGraduate Courses Leading to M.

Dr.<br />\nLatane was the speaker at the first<br />\n\u2022meeting of the Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa at Washington and Lee.<br />\nWith the-forming of the Hopkins<br />\ncircle, his associate membership has<br />\nbeen transferred fiorn Washington<br />\nand Lee to' this University.<br />\n\u00b0thee ',informal talks followed<br />\nDr.. Latane's. Dean Brush spoke<br />\nof the need Which the society filled<br />\nin University life, and asked for its<br />\nco-operation in all matters of Hopkins concern. President Knipp also<br />\nspoke of the part which the society<br />\nshould play in the development of<br />\nUniversity spirit-and in the furtherance of all University undertakings.<br />\nPresent at the initiation ceremonies and the banquet, in addition<br />\nto the new members, were Drs.<br />\nMurray P. Brush, John C. French,<br />\nRalph V. D. Magoffin and Charles<br />\nJ. Tilden as faculty members; Dr.<br />\nJohn H. Latane as associate<br />\nmember, and Myron E. Bagley,<br />\nHiram W. Woodward, Edmund E.<br />\nSpieker, John C. Knipp, Vincent J.<br />\nBrooks and Paul W. Sutton, as<br />\ncharter student members.<br /><br />\nWith the informal approval of<br />\nthe Faculty Commit ee on Student<br />\nAffairs, it is now practically certain<br />\nthat, with the exception of the first<br />\nprovision, the new Freshman Regulations proposed by the Junior<br />\nCommittee and passed unanimously<br />\nby the Student Council, will he<br />\nadopted in full.<br />\nThe censored regulation reads as<br />\nfollows: -The Monday following<br />\nthe official opening of the University shall be known as 'ducking<br />\nday,' on which day all freshmen<br />\nshall voluntarily 'duck' or be compelled to 'duck' in the cooling pool<br />\nin the south court at Homewood.\"<br />\nThe chief objection brought up<br />\nby members of the faculty to this<br />\nplan is that it would be beyond all<br />\nhuman nature to expect the freshmen to agree to such a proposal<br />\npeacefully, and that the class conflicts which would inevitably follow any attempts to compel obediance to the rule would invalidate<br />\nthe force of the entire regulations.<br />\nWith this one exception, the concensus of faculty opinion seems to<br />\nbe strongly in favor of the regulations, and while no official action<br />\nhas been taken by the Academic<br />\nCouncil, there exists scarcely any<br />\ndoubt that, when the Class of 1920<br />\nconies to Homewood next fall, it<br />\nwill be forced to obey regulations<br />\nmore stringent than those of any<br />\npreceding year.<br />\nThe regulations will provide,<br />\nfirst, that all freshmen shall wear<br />\nthe official freshmen cap while on<br />\nUniversity property\u2014the cap to be<br />\nhalf black and half blue; second,<br />\nthat freshmen shall wear black<br />\nsocks and neckties until they have<br />\nwon two athletic contests from the<br />\nsophomores; third, that freshmen<br />\nshall not walk on the grass at<br />\nHomewood nor use the steps from<br />\nthe upper quadrangle to the south<br />\ncourt; fourth, that freshmen shall<br />\nbe made to occupy seats in the rooters' section at all games at Homewood Field; fifth, that no freshman shall smoke or wear his hat<br />\nin any University building; sixth,<br />\nthat no freshman shall ride in the<br />\nelevators in any University building: and seventh, that no freshman<br />\nshall wear a letter or any insignia<br />\nof athletic ability won at a preparatory school.<br /><br />\nHopkins men will hay,\u2018 special<br />\ninducements to join the various<br />\nmilitary and naval civilian activities<br />\nthis summer. Nearly fifty men<br />\nhave already promised to attend<br />\nthe Plattsburg and Og-lethorpe<br />\ntraining camps, and many others<br />\nare contemplating making the battle-ship cruise offered by the Navy<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nIt has recently been announced<br />\nby the heads of the Engineering<br />\nSchool that a month spent at one<br />\nof the military or naval training<br />\ncamps will be accepted in the place<br />\nof the summer work which has been<br />\nrequired in previous years. This<br />\nwork is not the surveying which is<br />\nnow going on\u2014that still is compulsory. Even the surveying, however, will .be cut short two or three<br />\ndays for the men who wish to attend the student camps at Plattsburg and Oglethorpe. Professor<br />\nTilden, who has taken an active<br />\npart in the military training at Hopkins this spring, is the originator<br />\nof both these plans.<br />\nThe naval training cruise begins<br />\non August 15 and lasts until September 12. The course of training<br />\nis to be given on reserve battleships. The qualifications for enrollment which Hopkins men will<br />\nhave to possess are as follows:<br />\nMust be a citizen of the United<br />\nStates, in good standing and vouched for by at least two reputable<br />\ncitizens whose standings are known<br />\nto the recruiting officer.<br />\nAge 19 to 45, inclusive. Minors<br />\nmust have the consent of parent<br />\nor guardian.<br />\nMust pass a prescribed physical<br />\nexamination.<br />\nPrevious service in the Army,<br />\nNavy or Marine Corps, if any,<br />\nmust have been honorable.<br />\nOn the cruise a portion of the<br />\nday will be given up to the study<br />\nof special subjects, which will 13-e<br />\nlargely optional, so that recruits<br />\nwho have aptitude for or knowledge of such subjects as navigation, signalling, radio work, steam<br />\nor electrical engineering, etc., may<br />\nhave an opportunity to specialize.<br />\nBoat drills will be given 'and landings made, and recruits will be<br />\ntaught the manual of arms and<br />\nmilitary formations.

Yet<br />\nthe difference will, must be, only<br />\nsuperficial. Hopkins can never<br />\nalter or modify the ideals for which<br />\nit has stood since its foundation\u2014<br />\nthat way lies smugness and mediocrity. The cultural endeavor, the<br />\nintellectual contact with the best<br />\nthere is in the University, culminating in the high dreams and firm<br />\nresolves without which a degree<br />\ndegenerates into a title, for which<br />\nall the Hopkins classes of the past<br />\nhave stood, can neither end nor<br />\nvary with a mere change in place.<br />\nThe seniors do indeed represent the<br />\nend of an era, but it is only an era<br />\nof physical restriction; between the<br />\naims of the past and the future<br />\nthere can be no break.<br />\n'Eulogies of graduation are commonplace and meaningless. The<br />\nclass which will graduate tomorrow<br />\nwill not shake the nation with .the<br />\nthunder of its release\u2014it is not<br />\nmeant to. The men whom it will<br />\nsend out into the world do not hold<br />\namong their ranks the learning of<br />\nthe ages, nor the intensified and<br /><br />\nsifted ability of a carefully labelled<br />\nintelleCtual aristocracy. Yet the<br />\nseniors whom. Hopkins has produced this year do stand, as Hopkins classes must always stand, for<br />\ntwo all important and all comprehensive things\u2014breadth of appreciation and breadth of purpose.<br />\nA Building for Student Activities.<br /><br />\nIn every university there must<br />\nbe one definite locality where student interest in student organizations may come to a head. In the<br />\nhistories of many colleges, such<br />\nlocalities have first been the campus in general, with separate buildings for each organization coming<br />\nas a late and luxurious development. The plan recently proposed<br />\nto convert the present Carroll<br />\nstable at Homewood into a building<br />\nto house all student offices and<br />\nmeeting places steers a middle path<br />\nbetween the two extremes. It seeks<br />\nto furnish means f,or each student<br />\ninterest to follow its own particular line of development with some<br />\nmodicum of centralization rather<br />\nthan for each headquarter to flit<br />\npromiscuously about the college<br />\ngreen; and it comes at a time when<br />\nthe condition of growth into which<br />\nthe University is about to embark<br />\nmakes the provision of such a building, far from a luxury, a necessity.<br />\nThat such a building as the one<br />\nproposed would tend towards the<br />\ndevelopment of Hopkins spirit<br />\namong undergraduates, there can<br />\nhardly be any question. The very<br />\nlife of the University centers about<br />\nits student activities ; the stronger<br />\nthe development of those activities,<br />\nthe greater the cohesion and the<br />\nunity of aim among the student body<br />\nas a whole. Hopkins has no desire<br />\nto so violate its ideals and its tradi-,<br />\ntions as to become an institution<br />\nadvertised with its student life in<br />\ndoub!e headlines and its university<br />\ncurriculum in footnotes ; nor does<br />\nthe proposed plan tend to any such<br />\nresult. It only provides sane and<br />\nnormal opportunities for that college life which makes an institution<br />\nof learning a separate community.<br />\nIt is seldom in the history of<br />\nHopkins that its alumni have been<br />\ncalled upon as a body to contribute<br />\na sum unobtainable in any other<br />\nway; there has not been nor is it<br />\nlikely that there will ever again be<br />\nanother building planned and accomplished by contributions from<br />\nthe entire body of our graduates.<br />\nWe are not a large university, with<br />\na hundred thousand men hanging<br />\nour diploma upon their walls ; in<br />\nnumbers, we are small. Yet there is<br />\na closeness among our students and<br />\nour graduates whichi many another<br />\ninstitution loses because of its very<br />\nsize ; the future of the student activity building could in no way be<br />\nbetter guaranteed than by entrusting its accomplishment entirely to<br />\nthe generosity of the men. who have<br />\nonce felt themselves the need which<br />\nwe are facing today.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nThe Removal to Homewood.<br />\nBy President Frank J. Goodnow.<br /><br />\nThe removal of the Philosophical Department of the University<br />\nto the new site at Homewood marks<br />\nthe beginning of the end of the<br />\nmovement which started more than<br />\nten years ago to provide this branch<br />\nof the University with more commodius and attractive quarters.<br />\nWe shall, unfortunately, as probably all interested in the University<br />\nknow, not be able, at present, to<br />\nmake provision at Homewood for<br />\nthe laboratory work in chemistry.<br />\nThe undergraduate lectures in that<br />\nsubject will be given, it is true, at<br />\nthe new site; but the undergraduate laboratory, as well as all the<br />\ngraduate work in chemistry, will be<br />\ncarried on in the present quarters<br />\nof the department.<br />\nMuch of \u2022the work of the University after the move to Homewood- will therefore be carried on<br />\nunder conditions which cannot be<br />\nregarded as ideal. Many of the<br />\nstudents, both graduate and undergraduate, will undoubtedly be put<br />\nto serious inconvenience because of<br />\nthe separation of the Chemical<br />\nLaboratory from the rest of the<br />\nwork of the Philosophical Department. At the same time it is believed that on the whole less inconvenience will be felt by the student body after the removal than<br />\nis experienced now. For it is to<br />\nbe remembered that most of the<br />\nengineering students have, during<br />\nthe past two years, been obliged to<br />\ndo part of their work at the old<br />\nsite and part in the new Engineering Building.<br />\nFurthermore, we shall, until we<br />\nare able to construct one or more<br />\nadditional buildings at the new site,<br />\nbe somewhat crowded in our new<br />\nquarters. The Academic Building, which was intended to house<br />\nmerely the non-scientific departments and the general library, will<br />\nfor the time being have to care as<br />\nwell for zoology and botany, part of<br />\nthe work in psychology and most of<br />\nthe administrative work of the entire University. Physics will share<br />\nwith mechanical and electrical engineering one of the engineering<br />\nbuildings, and geology and civil engineering will both find shelter in<br />\nthe new Civil Engineering Building.<br />\nThe move to Homewood will,<br />\ntherefore, unquestionably present<br />\ndifficult problems. The solution<br />\nreached will undoubtedly in a number of instances not be entirely<br />\nsatisfactory to all those interested.<br />\nThe wisest solution possible cannot<br /><br />\nbe made without the exhibition of a<br />\ngreat deal of patience by those concerned. There is, however, no<br />\nreason why, if we all try our best<br />\nto accommodate ourselves to the<br />\nnew conditions, 'we should not be<br />\nable to carry on the work of both<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate departments harmoniously and effectively.<br />\nIndeed, there will unquestionably<br />\nbe many advantages attaching to<br />\nthe work of the University at<br />\nHomewood even under the rather<br />\nunfavorable conditions under which<br />\nit will be inaugurated the coming<br />\nyear\u2014advantages which will become more and more apparent<br />\nafter we have become shaken down<br />\ninto our surroundings.<br />\nWe shall, in the first place;have a<br />\nsense of'permanence which has<br />\nbeen impossible so long as we knew<br />\nthat in all probability we should<br />\nmove in the near future. We shall<br />\ncome very soon to realize that we<br />\nare in what in all probability will<br />\nbe the permanent home of the<br />\nPhilosophical Department of the<br />\nUniversity. We shall surround<br />\nourselves gradually with those incidentals which give an academic atmosphere, but which are impossible<br />\nin a merely temporary home. We<br />\nall, I think, have felt the absence of<br />\nsuch an atmosphere at the old site.<br />\nSituated as we have been in the<br />\nmidst of city life, it was difficult,<br />\nif not impossible, for us to be subjected to many of those influences<br />\nwhich do so much to give the University man the poise, the outlook,<br />\nthe proper sense of values, so necessary for the'really educated man.<br />\nWe shall, in the second place, have<br />\na home of remarkable beauty. The<br />\ngreat natural charm of the Homewood site, with its views, its woods,<br />\nits flowers and its shrubbery, and<br />\nthe artistic buildings, which will<br />\never increase in their attractiveness<br />\nas the architectural plan approaches<br />\nrealization, cannot fail to exert a<br />\ncontinuous if silent and impalpable<br />\ninfluence of the greatest educational<br />\nvalue on us all\u2014teachers as well as<br />\nstudents. If we are able in the<br />\ncoming year to carry through our<br />\nplan .of building at least one dormitory, we shall not only have<br />\nadded .to the attractiveness of the<br />\nHomewood site, but we shall also<br />\nhave strengthened greatly its intangible influence. We hope, if<br />\nthis plan is realized, that the advantages of the Homewood site will<br />\nbe availed of by the students of the<br />\nMedical School. At present about<br />\nall that they know of Homewood is<br />\nthat there is an athletic field there<br />\nwhich only a few of them use.<br />\nWe hope, however, soon to have in<br />\naddition to the field a number of<br />\ntennis courts which will be al:railable to all members of th?, Uni-<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, JUNE 12,<br /><br />\nCLASS OF 1916<br /><br />\n191b.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nBy Courtesy of \"The Hullabaloo.\"<br /><br />\nversity.

Located in the heart<br />\nof a large city, its student meeting<br />\nplace a darkened basement and its<br />\ncampus a narrow alley of brick,<br />\nfor half a century Hopkins has carried on its work and developed<br />\nits traditions amid circumstances<br />\nwhich would have disheartened,<br />\nmany a larger and financially<br />\nstronger institution. Yet the very.<br />\nthings which to the outside world<br />\nmight be called handicaps have endeared themselves to a long line of<br />\nHopkins men, and parting from the<br />\nMonument street site comes with a<br />\ndistinct pang to the entire University.<br /><br />\nContrary to all forebodings and<br />\nin full accord with the University's'<br />\nfondest hopes, there will be a barber-shop at Homewood, and, what<br />\nis infinitely more important, it wiil<br />\nbe presided over, as it has been<br />\npresided over in the past, by our<br />\nown irreplaceable Walter.<br />\nIt is Walter himself who is the<br />\nmaker of this announcement. The interview was to have been one of condolences and memories; instead, it<br />\nturned on the tonsorial possibilities<br />\nof the new -Academic Building attic.<br />\nHe was not sure, Walter sated<br />\ncautiously\u2014the guarantee of his<br />\nfuture residence had not as yet<br />\nbeen made definite enough for him<br />\nto go the length of moving the<br />\ntreasures of the barber-shop from<br />\ntheir old abode; but he had received<br />\nassurances, he. acknowledged\u2014in<br />\nhis own mind even now there was<br />\nno doubt\u2014and all that really<br />\ntroubled him was the best location<br />\nfor him in the new Homewood<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nThe choice ranges from the basement of the Carroll Mansion to the<br />\npresent corn-crib of the old Carroll<br />\nstable. Walter confided, however,<br />\nthat, at present, the most available site seems to be the aforementioned attic of the Academic<br />\nBuilding. Whatever be his new<br />\nlocation, he stated, every picture<br />\nand souvenir of the present shop<br />\nwill go to Homewood with him.<br /><br />\nNext year the Monument street<br />\nbuildings will be vacant. No plans<br />\nhave been made for their disposal,<br />\nthey are merely on sale to the highest bidder. The Geological Building is already partly in the hands<br />\nof the Baltimore City College; that<br />\ninstitution may take over the remainder of the structure once that<br />\nHopkins has finally evacuated. The<br />\npossibilities for the disposal of<br />\nMcCoy Hall are numerous and<br />\nvaried. It may be used as a lecture<br />\nhall, it may be rented as a dancing<br />\nauditorium, or it may be converted<br />\ninto a garage. Yet these are only<br /><br />\npossibilities; meanwhile, the corridors will remain bleak and deserted,<br />\nthe bulletin board will present but<br />\na blank stretch of wall, the double<br />\ndoors of the basement will be firmly<br />\nlocked, and the elevator will slowly<br />\nrot upon its moorings.<br />\nAt Homewood, all will be new<br />\nand efficient. There will be no<br />\ntrace or reminder of the present<br />\npostoffice, with its- easy access into<br />\nthe cloak-room and its inevitable<br />\n9 o'clock crowd surging in front<br />\nof the window; instead, in the new<br />\nbasement, there will be a system<br />\nof individual boxes, open at all<br />\ntimes to the holders of the combinations. There will be no more<br /><br />\ncrawling journeys from first floor<br />\nto fourth, with the whole rusty lift<br />\nshaking menacingly as each successive foot is gained; at Homewood the elevators will be sure and<br />\nfast and shiny. There will be no<br />\nmore wooden steps worn into hollows on the inside curve by the<br />\nfootsteps of thousands of Hopkins<br />\nmen gone by; it will take long generations to wear hollows in the iron<br />\nstairs of the new Academic Building.<br />\nThe campus of the Hopkins of<br />\nold will soon be gone forever. The<br />\nclasses of the future will learn the<br />\nlore of university ways beneath<br />\ngenerous trees and on velvet lawns,<br />\nnot on curb stones and flags, to<br />\nthe accompaniment of rumbling<br />\nwagons and trolley cars.

Let us have a<br />\nreal college. Away with all Philistines, whether athlete, grind or<br />\nundifferentiated. A real undergraduate body has the unquestionable right and power to get rid of<br />\nanyone it does not want, employee,<br />\nstudent, or professor. Overboard<br />\nwith all Philistines\u2014but don't<br />\nimagine I preach any community of<br />\nwild romanticists presided over by<br />\nGautier in green trousers and Oscar<br />\nWilde in lemon-colored gloves. The<br />\ncollege is to be the achievement of<br />\nliberty from all intellectual shackles<br />\nof time, place and convention;<br />\nromanticism is a glamour that is<br />\npast, and doctrinairism of any sort<br />\nis, of course, the straitest of jackets.<br />\nEven sincerity must be of the spirit,<br />\nnot of the letter, explicit doctrine.<br />\n\"I am always insincere as knowing<br />\nthere are many moods.\"<br />\nWe have had a historic existence<br />\nin our few brief years and our<br />\nfew dingy buildings here at<br />\nHoward street and Druid Hill avenue. The University revolutionized<br />\nAmerican graduate Study by envisaging an ideal and realizing it.<br />\nThe college has at least reflected<br />\nthe truth of their atmosphere, and<br />\nis the place of all places for the<br />\nachievement of a college ideal. Let<br />\nus not write Ichabod over these<br />\ndoors and retire to a middle class<br />\ncomplacency -at Homewood. The<br />\ngraduate schools face a crisis of<br />\ntheir own in the preservation of<br />\ntheir heritage. Shall the college be<br />\ncontent with the hope of becoming<br />\n\"a regular college,\" and set off on<br />\na long stern chase, by the imitation<br />\nof externals and particulars, of institutions whose fruitage is far<br />\nfrom unquestioned, and whose age<br />\nand size are a vast advantage in<br />\ntheir own course, though a handicap which we do not have to overcome in the working out of our<br />\nown salvation ?<br /><br />\nMen Want<br />\nStylish Shoes<br />\nbut will not sacrifice comfort for style.<br />\nSlesinger combines comfort with style, and the<br />\nhigh quality gives long<br />\nwear.<br />\nThe entire second floor is<br />\ngiven over to the men's<br />\ndepartment.
