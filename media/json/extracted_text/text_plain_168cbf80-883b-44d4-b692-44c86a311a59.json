The crew of<br />\nthe spaceship<br />\nwere to be<br />\nSpaniards, since in those<br />\ndays<br />\nS paniards were generally<br />\nconsidered to<br />\nbe the most stoic,<br />\nhardY, and reliable of peoples.<br />\nLiving in Germany until he<br />\nWas 17,<br />\nDr. Friesen experienced<br />\n<br />\n\"a rigorous exposure to sports,\"<br />\nespecially soccer.

The phone<br />\ndressed according to their expectation of<br />\nnumber is 467-6040.<br />\nVV<br />\n<br />\nOur local man makes good: H. L. Mencken<br />\nA famous English author and critic was<br />\nfinally persuaded to journey to America.<br />\nWhen he arrived in New York, he was<br />\nreceived by a committee of our leading<br />\nacademicians. After an exchange of<br />\ngreetings, these distinguished educators<br />\nasked their honored guest if he wished to<br />\nsee anyone in particular while visiting.<br />\nAfter some thought, he replied that he<br />\nshould like very much to meet Mr.<br />\nMencken. The shocked scholars looked,<br />\naccording to one onlooker, as if he had<br />\nsaid, \"I am badly in need ofa whore.\"<br />\n<br />\nHuntington Cairns<br />\nauthor and critic<br />\nspeaking on<br />\nMencken's Baltimore and the Critics<br />\n<br />\n\u20acb'%<br />\n<br />\nHuntington Cairns delivered the annual<br />\nMencken Memorial Lecture last Saturday<br />\nin the Wheeler Auditorium of the Enoch<br />\nPratt Library to a standing room only<br />\naudience. His lecture, of which the above<br />\nanecdote was but a small part, was<br />\naccompanied by the public opening of<br />\nlibrary's Mencken Room. Only once each<br />\nyear are Mencken's private papers and<br />\nbooks made accessible to a public whose<br />\nappreciation of Mencken's achievements<br />\ncontinues to grow.<br />\nThe lecture's intent was dual in nature.<br />\nMr. Cairns, who like Mencken was born<br />\nand educated in Baltimore, wished to<br />\nexamine Mencken's relationship to<br />\nBaltimore and to the critics. The<br />\nimplication of Mr. Cairns' opening<br />\ncomments was that Mencken was<br />\ninfluenced by a miniature \"renaissance\"<br />\n<br />\n-11 -UM<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\na polar freeze. The misery which came<br />\nfrom such innocent but yet false<br />\nexpectations was cruel.<br />\nAn amazing, and often disappointing,<br />\nfeature of recent winter seasons is the<br />\nadamant refusal of this city to have a real,<br />\nno-nonsense snow storm. There is<br />\nsomething aesthetically offensive about<br />\nseeing slush fall from the sky. It insults<br />\none's idealistic belief in the heavenly<br />\nvirtues and corrupts the mythical notion<br />\nthat above us there exists a purity beyond<br />\nthe reach of earthly man. Critics of<br />\nBaltimore weather know better than that;<br />\nthey have been hardened by the realities<br />\nof a Baltimore slush storm.<br />\nAmidst these paradoxes of Baltimore<br />\nwinters, some consistent patterns of<br />\nbehavior in other phases of local weather<br />\nshould be noted. One is the regularity<br />\nwith which rain strikes Baltimore. It is<br />\nnow common knowledge that one need<br />\nonly check the baseball schedule of the<br />\nBaltimore Orioles to discover in advance<br />\n<br />\nle%<br />\n<br />\n1\u20221<br />\n31<br />\n<br />\nAirlbillos<br />\n<br />\nthe wisdom of carrying one's umbrella to<br />\nschool. When the Orioles are at home, the<br />\nchances for rain are excellent. This is not<br />\nsimply an intuition based on experience,<br />\nfor statistics indicate that last year the<br />\nOrioles led the major leagues in<br />\nrained-out home games.<br />\nA similar situation exists regarding a<br />\nlocal Johns Hopkins event, the Sunday<br />\nEvening Concerts held in Shriver Hall.<br />\nThough records are not kept, it is now<br />\npart of Hopkins folklore that such<br />\nentertainment has never failed to produce<br />\na downpour, much to the delight of the<br />\nassembled devotees of chamber music.<br />\nSomehow, the music just wouldn't be the<br />\nsame without it.<br />\nWe can no longer have any sympathy<br />\nfor the average Hopkins cynic who makes<br />\na tradition of lambasting Baltimore<br />\nweather. He has only himself to blame for<br />\nfailing to appreciate the finer intricacies<br />\nof the climate which manage to amuse<br />\nthe true natives.<br />\n<br />\nof the arts which occurred in Baltimore in<br />\nthe 1920's. Mencken, in turn, influenced<br />\nthe thinking of many local artists and<br />\nwriters. While this seems like a plausible<br />\nargument, one feels that it was not<br />\npursued in the remainder of the address<br />\nand thus remains unproven.<br />\n<br />\nYet many did choose to quarrel, and<br />\noften vehemently. with Mencken's<br />\nliterary and social views. Ernest<br />\nHemingway became enraged at a<br />\nMencken volley aimed in his direction<br />\nand . threatened to pummel him. Though.<br />\nMencken abhorred all physical activity<br />\n<br />\nWho could quarrel<br />\nwith a mind so intensely alive?<br />\nWhile the nature of Mencken's<br />\nrelationship with Baltimore.s other artists<br />\nremains unclear, there can be no doubt<br />\nthat a deep affinity existed between<br />\nMencken and this city. Unlike some<br />\npersonalities of recent vintage who have<br />\nrushed to New York to claim fame and<br />\nfortune, Mencken remained oblivious to<br />\na loyal Baltimorean, working on and off<br />\nfor the Baltimore Sunpapers until his<br />\ndeath.<br />\nThough Mencken found Baltimore a<br />\ncharming city in many respects,<br />\nappreciating especially its culinary<br />\ndelights, the city establishment was often<br />\nscornful of Mencken's critical opinions.<br />\nMore important, this abuse was aimed at<br />\nMencken on a national as well as a local<br />\nscale. Cairns was strongest in showing<br />\nhow Mencken traded blows with the<br />\nWerary and critical establishments.<br />\nHe pointed out that prominent<br />\nacademic critics such as Irving Babbitt<br />\nand Paul Elmore More ignored Mencken,<br />\nwhile - others (including T.S. Eliot)<br />\nattacked him. On the other hand, writers<br />\nsuch as Aldous Huxley and Edmund<br />\nWilson found Mencken \"inspiring.\" In the<br />\nintroduction to his Mencken reader,<br />\nCairns notes that Joseph Conrad found<br />\nMencken's vigor \"like an electric<br />\ncurrent.\" Conrad asks, \"...Who could<br />\nquarrel...with a mind so intensely alive?\"<br />\nand was convinced that the athletically<br />\n<br />\ninclined were \"simians of the genus<br />\nHy lob a tes,\" lie refused to flee the<br />\nramparts of literary criticism upon this<br />\nthreat of fisticuffs and returned<br />\nHemingway's tire.<br />\nCairns' address did not consider<br />\nMencken in his role as social critic.<br />\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that it<br />\npromi nence in the late 1920's. His<br />\nreporting of the Scopes trial is<br />\nparticularly memorable. Of William<br />\nJennings Bryan's last days at Dayton he<br />\nwrote: \"...he was simply a walking fever.<br />\nHour by hour he grew more bitter. What<br />\nthe Christian Scentists call malicious<br />\nanimal magnetism seemed to radiate from<br />\nhim like hear from a stove.... The artful<br />\nDarrow led him on; he repeated it (the<br />\nnotion that man is not a mammal), ranted<br />\nfor it, bellowed it in his cracked voice. So<br />\nhe was prepared for the final slaughter.<br />\nHe came into life a hero, a Galahad, in<br />\nbright and shining armor. He was passing<br />\nout a poor mountebank.\"<br />\nThe memorial address concluded with<br />\na comparison of Poe and Mencken at the<br />\nend of their lives. Both were largely<br />\nignored at the time of their deaths.<br />\nMencken's brief funeral was attended by<br />\nhis brothers and a few friends who<br />\nafterwards drifted gently away into the<br />\nbleak winter's day, according to Cairns,<br />\n\"much as Mencken would have wanted<br />\nit.<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nThe inner city and art at Charles Center<br />\nBy MICHAEL SIEGEL<br />\nIf you think you already know the<br />\ncontents of all the regular Baltimore<br />\nmuseums by heart, you might want to<br />\nvisit the new downtown branch of the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art. It's located at<br />\nOne Charles Center on the plaza level,<br />\nand it's a nice change from the usual<br />\nset-up. since there aren't even any formal<br />\ngalleries. Right now, the products of this<br />\nsummer's Model Cities Cultural Arts<br />\nProject are on display. and the paintings<br />\nand photographs on display are of good<br />\ncalibre. You can't mistake the items for<br />\nprofessional efforts, but they're<br />\ninteresting in their own amateurish way.<br />\nAs is common with most general<br />\nexhibits. the paintings on display at<br />\nCharles Center range in form from still<br />\nlife, to the pastoral and portraits. through<br />\ncubist and dadaist. What they all have in<br />\ncommon is a suggestion of enthusiasm -you can see that the artists enjoyed their<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe still lifes are probably the most<br />\ndisappointing, even though they involve<br />\nthe least complex style of painting in<br />\nterms of arrangement and perspective.<br />\nThe student artists used very bright and<br />\nloud colors, most of which are the<br />\nprimary colors. Thus some paintings are<br />\nharsh to the eye. In addition, there are<br />\nembarrassing signs that some of the artists<br />\nhad real difficulty dealing with<br />\nperspective. Another disappointment is<br />\n<br />\nthe procession of vases and bowls of fruit<br />\nwhich become interchangeable. Some of<br />\nthe paintings are failures, but still, this is<br />\nno ordinary museum.<br />\nThe specific scenes of the pastorals are<br />\nalso less than inspirational, but they<br />\nremain remarkable if you take into \u2022<br />\ndifferent techniques of the medium are<br />\nused to great advantage in these paintings,<br />\nand they add to the grotesque quality of<br />\n<br />\nthese works. Disjionted eyeballs, gigantic<br />\nturbines, and trees floating in the air<br />\nprovide aggressive scenes. One series of<br />\nfour pictures by an eighteen-year-old can<br />\nonly be described as \"abstract rainbows.\"<br />\nTogether they display a brilliant,<br />\nbeautiful merging and dissolving of color.<br />\nThe paintings in the series blend together;<br />\nthe frames might as well not be there.<br />\nThe most successful paintings on<br />\n<br />\naccount the fact that most of the Model<br />\nCities neighborhoods are the hard-core<br />\ninner city areas. The environment<br />\ndepicted in the pastorals is almost<br />\ndiametrically opposite to that of the<br />\nhomes of the artists.<br />\nSome of thc paintings are<br />\nhonest-to-goodness crazy (surrealistic is<br />\nthe conventional word). Odd, harsh<br />\nshapes and gross, evil distortions exist in<br />\nthe artists' visual presentation. The<br />\ndisplay are the portraits. Many are quite<br />\ngood, a few are excellent, and one or two<br />\ncan only be called remarkable,<br />\nparticularly when the minimum of formal<br />\ntraining that these artists have had is<br />\ntaken into account. One of these,<br />\nstrategically located by the entrance, is<br />\ndefinitely the show stopper. It's a simple<br />\nblack and white study in silhouette of a<br />\nstrikingly beautiful Black girl with an<br />\nafro. It's hard to imagine anyone simply<br />\nwalking by it.<br />\nAs a whole the exhibit makes a<br />\nbrilliant display of what urban aid<br />\nprograms (such as the Model Cities<br />\nprogram) can achieve. The next time that<br />\na legislator suggests that such programs<br />\nshould be curtailed, take him down to<br />\nOne Charles Center. And if you have<br />\nsome free time this weekend, you can't<br />\ncomplain of not knowing about<br />\nsomething interesting to do.

While 101<br />\nlegislators voted for the passage,<br />\nthere was enough public reaction<br />\nto bring the matter before the<br />\nvoters in a referendum in this<br />\nyear's general election.<br />\nThe vote on Referendum<br />\nQuestion 18 will determine<br />\nwhether or not aid to non-public<br />\nschools is to be continued.<br />\nAt present, the bill is designed<br />\nto aid lower and middle income<br />\nfamilies by granting sums of $75<br />\nto $200 depending on their<br />\nincome.

Under<br />\nhis leadership, the offense was<br />\nthe highest scoring in the division<br />\nlast season, and there is no reason<br />\nwhy the Jays cannot repeat this<br />\nyear.<br />\nTo throw to, Thomas will have<br />\nveteran wide receiver Grant<br />\nShevchik and last year's leading<br />\nreceiver, tight end Rick<br />\nKowalchuk, whom Cox sees as<br />\nplaying another important role<br />\nthis year.<br />\nTo replace graduated ground<br />\nleader Butch Robey at halfback,<br />\nHopkins has come up with senior<br />\nTim Doyle, a transfer student<br />\nfrom Clemson, who appears<br />\nperfectly, capable of filling<br />\nRobey's shoes. Rounding out the<br />\noffensive backfield for this<br />\nSaturday will be co-captain Jim<br />\nFerguson at fullback and Hal<br />\nAltman at right halfback, with<br />\ncapable Pat Neary in reserve.<br />\nThe offensive line was<br />\ndescribed by Cox as \"strong<br />\ndown the middle.\" High praise<br />\nwas awarded to center Sam<br />\nPalmisano, whom Cox has called<br />\nthe best .center he has coached<br />\nsince Wayne Mulligan, presently<br />\nof the St. Louis Cardinals.<br />\n<br />\nPlaudits also went to left guard<br />\nJoe Ouslander, who has \"worked<br />\nso hard, and looked so good.\"<br />\nCoach Cox thinks Joe could be a<br />\ndefinite All-Conference selection<br />\nby the end of the season.<br />\nThe other offensive linemen<br />\nare guard Jim Adams,and tackles<br />\nBarry Van Orman and Mike<br />\nRiley. The Blue Jay defense<br />\nfeatures an excellent secondary<br />\nof Harry Stringer, Les Mathews<br />\n(\"improved 200% last year\"),<br />\nand Billy Nolan, all returning as a<br />\nunit from last year.<br />\nLeading the linebacking squad<br />\nare Gunter Glocker and Jim<br />\nMoran, who watch the middle,<br />\nwhile Craig Stevens and Richard<br />\nHagerty watch the outside, but<br />\nplay on the line, inside the ends,<br />\nin Coach Cox's 6-2-3 alignment.<br />\nIn the front four, the Jays will<br />\nfield steady Bruce Jackson and<br />\nwuick Rick Kuehn at ends. Mike<br />\nO'Brien and Keith Krantz at<br />\ntackles will be bearing the brunt<br />\nof opposition running attacks.<br />\nWhile the Jays will be fielding<br />\nbasically the same personnel as<br />\nlast year, with more experience,<br />\nMuhlenberg will be showing<br />\nHopkins a different face.<br />\nThey still have wide receiver<br />\nGeorge Wheeler, who hauled<br />\ndown a last-second 61 -yard pass<br />\nin last year's game to set up the<br />\nwinning touchdown. But gone is<br />\nthe man who threw that pass,<br />\nquarterback Ed DiYanni, last<br />\nyear's MAC total offense leader.<br />\nWith his passing arm missing,<br />\nMuhlenberg will be expected to<br />\nrun more often this year.<br />\nThe Allentown team's<br />\nstrength, though, is in its defense.<br />\nLike Hopkins, their defensive<br />\nsecondary is returning intact and<br />\nin good shape. They also feature<br />\ntwo excellent linebackers, Easen<br />\nand Schneider.<br />\nNevertheless, for Coach Cox,<br />\nthe key to tomorrow afternoon's<br />\ngame lies in Hopkins offensive<br />\npower. He hopes to establish at<br />\nleast one good running play early<br />\n<br />\nin the game which Muhlenberg<br />\nhas to stop, and then exploit<br />\nwhat weaknesses they leave open<br />\nwhen they try to compensate.<br />\nHere, the positions to watch are<br />\nthe Jays' offensive tackles, to see<br />\nhow well they can immobilize<br />\ntheir opponents and make<br />\noff-tackle and outside plays<br />\nwork.<br />\nDefensively, the Blue Jays will<br />\nhave to stop Muhlenberg's<br />\nrunning game. Cox sees the left<br />\nside of the defensive line (Kuehn,<br />\nStevens, O'Brien) as playing the<br />\nkey role.<br />\nIn summing up the team's<br />\nchances, the coach, not wanting<br />\nto appear over-confident, was<br />\nhesitant to predict victory. And<br />\nrightfully so. Muhlenberg has<br />\nonly played once in scrimmage<br />\nand it is too difficult to evaluate<br />\nthem just yet. Hopkins has good<br />\npersonnel, but by no means do<br />\nthe Jays have a big edge in that<br />\ndepartment.<br />\n<br />\nBig Jay Gridman Sam Palmasano<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nspoRTs<br />\n<br />\nSix thinclads return for season<br />\nbecause they enjoy the running<br />\nBy GERRY GREENFIELD<br />\nOn every team there is a group<br />\nwho, through their dedication,<br />\nperserverence and potential, form<br />\na nucleus of talent: the Hopkins<br />\ncross country is no exception.<br />\nTheir nucleus is composed of six<br />\nsophomores, all of whom were<br />\non the team last year. They all<br />\nhave one thing in common , they<br />\nrun cross country because they<br />\nenjoy running.<br />\nJeff Greve was the top<br />\n<br />\nfreshman last year and is high on<br />\nthe team's list of runners this<br />\nyear. Although he runs track in<br />\nthe spring, Jeff maintains that his<br />\nmain sport is cross country<br />\nbecause it is less boring than<br />\ntrack. Last spring (after he had<br />\nrepresented Hopkins in the IC4A<br />\nIndoor championships as a<br />\nwalker) Jeff ran in the Boston<br />\nMarathon.<br />\nCharlie Mick is a tall man in a<br />\nsport of short men. He is the<br />\n<br />\nBluejay booters to face Haverford<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nTwo years ago Haverford<br />\nCollege was placed on the Johns<br />\nHopkins soccer schedule. After<br />\ntheir first meeting, each team put<br />\n'a \"one\" under the \"tie\" column<br />\nof their season records. Last year<br />\nwas a bit different, however, with<br />\nthe Blue Jays walking away with<br />\na four to one victory.<br />\nHaverford has always been a<br />\nstrong finishing team, starting<br />\n<br />\ntheir season slowly and gradually<br />\nimproving, then coming on<br />\nstrong in the end. At the end of<br />\nlast year's season, they beat<br />\nsecond place Swarthmore by a<br />\nscore of six to one. This allowed<br />\nthem to share the fourth place<br />\nslot in the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference with the Blue Jay<br />\nteam.<br />\nNine of the eleven starters of<br />\ntheir 1971 team will be retumin<br />\n<br />\nas opposed to eight of Hopkins.<br />\nHaverford did, however, make a<br />\nchange of coaches. Their new<br />\ncoach will have worked with<br />\ntheir team for a little less than a<br />\nmonth and whether a smooth<br />\nadjustment has been made<br />\nbetween players' and the coach<br />\nwill be seen Saturday afternoon.<br />\nHaverford actually plays<br />\nHopkins' style of ballgame, and<br />\n<br />\ndemonstrates the same general<br />\nlevel of skills and talent. This<br />\nyear, of course, the Jays have<br />\nadded more talent and appear to<br />\nhave better team work. On the<br />\noffense, Hopkins moves the ball<br />\nwith more finesse than some of<br />\nits more recent teams, but the<br />\nfinal touch of putting the ball<br />\ninto the net is still missing.<br />\nThe top two \"finishers\" on the<br />\nBlue Jay team are senior Marc<br />\nManzione and junior Robert<br />\nArguero who have both improved<br />\nconsiderably over the last few<br />\nscrimmages. The offense has<br />\nshown its ability to move the ball<br />\nup to the opponent's net, and<br />\nnow mast prove that it does<br />\nindeed have the ability to put the<br />\nball into the goal.<br />\nAdvantage<br />\nThe game should undoubtedly<br />\nbe close with the home field<br />\nadvantage going to Haverford.<br />\nHopkins, however, has a great<br />\nteam spirit which, in their type<br />\nof ball game, can make the<br />\ndifference between a win and a<br />\nloss.<br />\n<br />\ntallest man on the team at 6'4\"<br />\nand in spite of the fact that tall<br />\nmen are few in cross country has<br />\nreturned for a second year. The<br />\nmain reason for his fall running is<br />\npreparation for the winter and<br />\nspring track seasons. Last year he<br />\nwas the team's top half miler and<br />\nran on the record holding mile<br />\nrelay team.<br />\nDave Piccoli runs cross<br />\ncountry as a serious sport. He has<br />\nbeen running for five years, and<br />\nhopes to compete in some big<br />\nmeets this fall. In the off season<br />\nDave plays and teaches tennis.<br />\nSteve Rothwell is a two miler<br />\non the track team, but says he<br />\nonly runs track to fill in the time<br />\nbetween cross country seasons.<br />\nThis is his second year on the<br />\nteam and he says he just enjoys<br />\nplain running (a good attitude for<br />\na distance man).<br />\nBill Schickler had not planned<br />\nto run cross country when he<br />\ncame here, but one day he and<br />\nhis roommate (Dave Piccoli)<br />\nwent to the track and were<br />\ntalked into coming out for the<br />\nteam in every team in every meet<br />\nin addition to running the mile<br />\non the track team in the<br />\nspring. John Tetslaff is in his<br />\nsecond season of competitive<br />\nrunning, but still loves the sport.<br />\nIn addition to a great deal of<br />\nbicycle riding he also trains by<br />\nrunning overdistance (ten to<br />\nfifteen miles) in the off season.<br />\nHis main dislike is interval work,<br />\nwhich is usually done on the<br />\ntrack.<br />\nAs with any sport there are<br />\nthose who receive little publicity<br />\nand few awards, but cross<br />\ncountry is probably the only<br />\nsport in which this is true for an<br />\nentire team.<br />\n<br />\n\fseptember 22, 1972/news-letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nsports briefs<br />\nWillie Scroggs Appointed Coach<br />\n<br />\nFor those who have not yet<br />\nheard the news, it has been<br />\nannounced that Coach Mike<br />\nHanna has resigned from the<br />\nHopkins' staff to fill the position<br />\nof assistant lacrosse coach at the<br />\nU.S. Naval Academy.<br />\nReplacing him on a full time<br />\nbasis will be Willie Scroggs, a '68<br />\nHopkins' graduate, who was<br />\nAll-Maryland three years straight<br />\nas a defensive back on the<br />\nfootball team, and<br />\nAll-Mason\u2014Dixon his senior year.<br />\nScroggs also played for three<br />\nchampionship lacrosse teams<br />\nduring his time here at Hopkins.<br />\nScroggs will be serving as<br />\nassistant coach on the football,<br />\nwrestling and lacrosse teams.<br />\nHaverford Game Cancelled<br />\n<br />\nDue to several serious injuries,<br />\nloss of players with experience<br />\n<br />\nand a general lack of enthusiasm,<br />\nHaverford College has announced<br />\nthat it will not be represented by<br />\na football team this season.<br />\nAs a result, the Haverford<br />\ngame, scheduled to be played<br />\nOctober 14, at home, will be<br />\ncancelled without any<br />\nreplacement.<br />\nIt is hoped that the<br />\nHopkins-Haverford rivalry can<br />\nagain be continued next season,<br />\ndespite the troubles this year.<br />\nThe opening soccer game, scheduled for this Saturday at<br />\nHaverford, will still be played at<br />\nthis time.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Admission<br />\n<br />\nThis year, all that will be<br />\nrequired for students to attend<br />\nhome sports contests is one's ID<br />\ncard (which will allow the<br />\nstudent and one guest to enter<br />\nfree of charge).<br />\nFaculty members will still use<br />\nticket books, which are available<br />\nnow at the Athletic Center<br />\nOffice.

He is expected to give<br />\na brief description of the PIRG<br />\nconcept as practiced in<br />\npreviously established student<br />\ngroups in ten other states.<br />\nAccording to Jim Cubie,<br />\nUniversity of Maryland Law<br />\nSchool student and a member of<br />\nMaryPIRG's organizing<br />\ncommittee, the purpose of<br />\nNader's PIRG program is to<br />\nestablish localized, student<br />\nfunded and controlled<br />\norganizations to investigate a<br />\nwide range of social issues. The<br />\nMaryPIRG will also act in an<br />\nadvisory capacity in cases of<br />\nconsumer, and in general, public<br />\ngrievences.<br />\nFunding<br />\nFunding of the group is to be<br />\naccomplished by a voluntary<br />\nthree-dollar increase to student<br />\nactivity fees at area schools. The<br />\ncollected funds are to be used to<br />\npay the salaries of various<br />\nprofessionals, including attorneys<br />\nand researchers; whose activities<br />\nwill be co-ordinated with those<br />\nof MaryPIRG.<br />\nThe formal establishment of<br />\nthe group is contingent upon a<br />\nsuccessful petition drive at each<br />\ncampus, showing the student<br />\nbody's desire to belong to the<br />\ngroup, and afterwards, an<br />\nagreement with the school's<br />\nBoard of Trustees or Tegents<br />\ngiving permission to institute the<br />\n<br />\nAlthough there was no formal<br />\ntestimony against any of the bills<br />\npresented in the various<br />\ncommittees last year, opposition<br />\ncame in the form of letters and<br />\nphone calls from a variety of<br />\nsources. Differences of opinion<br />\narose among restaurant owners<br />\nand wholesale liquor dealers<br />\nconcerned with lowering drinking<br />\nages on all alcoholic beverages or<br />\njust on beer and wine.<br />\nObservors in Annapolis felt<br />\nthat the bills were defeated<br />\nprimarily because the case for<br />\npassage was not convincing<br />\nenough to carry agaginst<br />\nopposition voiced privately to<br />\nlegislators from constituents and<br />\nother private interests. In<br />\naddition, it was felt that the<br />\nconfusion raised by the variety<br />\nand scope of the different bills<br />\nhindered any attempts at passage.<br />\nWhile drinking age proposals<br />\nnaturally gained support from<br />\nyoung people across the state, no<br />\ncommittee testimony was given<br />\nby any University. Ellery<br />\nWoodworth, Special Legislative<br />\n<br />\nfunding increase. The funding<br />\ncharge, once added to the<br />\nschool's activity fee, would be<br />\ncompletely voluntary. Students<br />\nnot wishing to join MaryPIRG<br />\nwould be able to indicate their<br />\ndecision at registration, thus<br />\navoiding the fee. According to<br />\nCubie, MaryPIRG's budget for its<br />\nfirst year of operation will be<br />\nclose to $50,000.<br />\nOrganization<br />\nThe internal structure of<br />\nMaryPIRG will consist of a Board<br />\nof Directors, composed of<br />\nelected representatives from each<br />\nmember school. The number of<br />\ndirectorships permitted each<br />\nschool will be proportionate to<br />\nthe percentage of the total<br />\nMaryPIRG membership attending<br />\nthe school.<br />\n\"The Board of Directors will<br />\nbe responsible for establishing<br />\nproject priorities,\" Cubie said,<br />\nadding that rent escrow cases,<br />\nrace and sex discrimination,<br />\nconsumer fraud, and<br />\nenvironmental concerns will most<br />\nlikely be stressed.<br />\n<br />\nRalph Nader speaking at Goucher last spring.<br />\nAssistant to President Muller, the 54 \"age of majorityy\" bills<br />\ncurrently under consideration.<br />\ncommented: \"Last year, this (the<br />\n54 Bills<br />\ndrinking age bill) was not a<br />\nmany different<br />\nthe<br />\nAfter<br />\nhe<br />\nHopkins project.\" Although<br />\nworked very closely with proposals were contested in last<br />\nDelegate Glaser on the problems year's legislative session, it was<br />\nrelated with this legislation, decided that all facets of the<br />\nWoodworth did not testify on current \"age of majority\" laws in<br />\nany of the age of majority bills. the state Charter would be<br />\nWoodworth and President studied in Committee, during the<br />\nMuller have not yet discussed summer.

Three drinking<br />\nage bills, similar to the current<br />\nproposal were defeated in the last<br />\nlegislative session.<br />\nThe Curran-Conroy beer and<br />\nwine bill passed the Senate last<br />\nMarch but was killed in the<br />\nHouse Committee on Economic<br />\nMatters. A House bill sponsored<br />\nby Delegate Glaser was defeated<br />\nby 17 votes on the House of<br />\nDelegates floor. Likewise, the<br />\ndrinking age portion of the<br />\nEmanual-Crawford bill which<br />\nalso included provisions for 18<br />\nyear old voting and car<br />\nownership was defeated in the<br />\nHouse last spring.<br />\nWork\u2014study<br />\nAfter a member school's<br />\ngoverning body has approved the<br />\ngroup's establishment, MaryPIRG<br />\n<br />\nBy ROBERT PAULUS<br />\nA bill which would lower the<br />\ndrinking age for beer and wine to<br />\n18 is now pending vefore the<br />\nMaryland Senate and House<br />\nJudicial Proceedings Committees.<br />\nAccording to Timothy Clark,<br />\nLegislative Assistant to State<br />\nSenator J. Joseph Curran Jr., the<br />\nbill has a good chance of passing<br />\nits crucial October 21st<br />\nCommittee vote.<br />\nThe drinking age bill<br />\nintroduced by Senator Steers is<br />\none of 54 pieces of proposed<br />\nlegislation that would change<br />\nMaryland's \"age of majority\"<br />\nincluding the legal age of liability<br />\nfrom 21 to 18. If it passes the<br />\nJudicial Proceedings Committees'<br />\nqtote, the bill will be introduced<br />\ninto the General Assembly when<br />\nit reconvenes in January.<br />\nLast year up to ten different<br />\n<br />\nwill offer, in conjunction with<br />\nthe school's faculty, a program of<br />\nwork-study and seminar courses<br />\nin public interest research and<br />\nadvocacy.<br />\nWhen asked if undergraduate<br />\ncould effectively contribute to<br />\nresearch groups which usually<br />\nconsist of law and other graduate<br />\nstudents, Cubie replied that<br />\nundergrads can be especially<br />\neffective in their areas of study.<br />\nReview Gas<br />\n\"For example,\" he said,<br />\n\"Biology students can sample<br />\npollution in the area's waters. In<br />\norder to help minimize the retail<br />\ncosts of drugs, chemistry<br />\nstudents might conduct a study<br />\non the use of generic rather than<br />\nbrand names in prescription<br />\nmedications.

Critics of<br />\nBaltimore weather know better than that;<br />\nthey have been hardened by the realities<br />\nof a Baltimore slush storm.<br />\nAmidst these paradoxes of Baltimore<br />\nwinters, some consistent patterns of<br />\nbehavior in other phases of local weather<br />\nshould be noted.

When the Orioles are at home, the<br />\nchances for rain are excellent. This is not<br />\nsimply an intuition based on experience,<br />\nfor statistics indicate that last year the<br />\nOrioles led the major leagues in<br />\nrained-out home games.<br />\nA similar situation exists regarding a<br />\nlocal Johns Hopkins event, the Sunday<br />\nEvening Concerts held in Shriver Hall.<br />\nThough records are not kept, it is now<br />\npart of Hopkins folklore that such<br />\nentertainment has never failed to produce<br />\na downpour, much to the delight of the<br />\nassembled devotees of chamber music.<br />\nSomehow, the music just wouldn't be the<br />\nsame without it.<br />\nWe can no longer have any sympathy<br />\nfor the average Hopkins cynic who makes<br />\na tradition of lambasting Baltimore<br />\nweather. He has only himself to blame for<br />\nfailing to appreciate the finer intricacies<br />\nof the climate which manage to amuse<br />\nthe true natives.<br /><br />\nof the arts which occurred in Baltimore in<br />\nthe 1920's. Mencken, in turn, influenced<br />\nthe thinking of many local artists and<br />\nwriters. While this seems like a plausible<br />\nargument, one feels that it was not<br />\npursued in the remainder of the address<br />\nand thus remains unproven.<br /><br />\nYet many did choose to quarrel, and<br />\noften vehemently. with Mencken's<br />\nliterary and social views. Ernest<br />\nHemingway became enraged at a<br />\nMencken volley aimed in his direction<br />\nand . threatened to pummel him. Though.<br />\nMencken abhorred all physical activity<br /><br />\nWho could quarrel<br />\nwith a mind so intensely alive?<br />\nWhile the nature of Mencken's<br />\nrelationship with Baltimore.s other artists<br />\nremains unclear, there can be no doubt<br />\nthat a deep affinity existed between<br />\nMencken and this city. Unlike some<br />\npersonalities of recent vintage who have<br />\nrushed to New York to claim fame and<br />\nfortune, Mencken remained oblivious to<br />\na loyal Baltimorean, working on and off<br />\nfor the Baltimore Sunpapers until his<br />\ndeath.<br />\nThough Mencken found Baltimore a<br />\ncharming city in many respects,<br />\nappreciating especially its culinary<br />\ndelights, the city establishment was often<br />\nscornful of Mencken's critical opinions.<br />\nMore important, this abuse was aimed at<br />\nMencken on a national as well as a local<br />\nscale. Cairns was strongest in showing<br />\nhow Mencken traded blows with the<br />\nWerary and critical establishments.<br />\nHe pointed out that prominent<br />\nacademic critics such as Irving Babbitt<br />\nand Paul Elmore More ignored Mencken,<br />\nwhile - others (including T.S. Eliot)<br />\nattacked him. On the other hand, writers<br />\nsuch as Aldous Huxley and Edmund<br />\nWilson found Mencken \"inspiring.\" In the<br />\nintroduction to his Mencken reader,<br />\nCairns notes that Joseph Conrad found<br />\nMencken's vigor \"like an electric<br />\ncurrent.\" Conrad asks, \"...Who could<br />\nquarrel...with a mind so intensely alive?\"<br />\nand was convinced that the athletically<br /><br />\ninclined were \"simians of the genus<br />\nHy lob a tes,\" lie refused to flee the<br />\nramparts of literary criticism upon this<br />\nthreat of fisticuffs and returned<br />\nHemingway's tire.<br />\nCairns' address did not consider<br />\nMencken in his role as social critic.<br />\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that it<br />\npromi nence in the late 1920's. His<br />\nreporting of the Scopes trial is<br />\nparticularly memorable. Of William<br />\nJennings Bryan's last days at Dayton he<br />\nwrote: \"...he was simply a walking fever.<br />\nHour by hour he grew more bitter.

It's located at<br />\nOne Charles Center on the plaza level,<br />\nand it's a nice change from the usual<br />\nset-up. since there aren't even any formal<br />\ngalleries. Right now, the products of this<br />\nsummer's Model Cities Cultural Arts<br />\nProject are on display. and the paintings<br />\nand photographs on display are of good<br />\ncalibre. You can't mistake the items for<br />\nprofessional efforts, but they're<br />\ninteresting in their own amateurish way.<br />\nAs is common with most general<br />\nexhibits. the paintings on display at<br />\nCharles Center range in form from still<br />\nlife, to the pastoral and portraits. through<br />\ncubist and dadaist. What they all have in<br />\ncommon is a suggestion of enthusiasm -you can see that the artists enjoyed their<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe still lifes are probably the most<br />\ndisappointing, even though they involve<br />\nthe least complex style of painting in<br />\nterms of arrangement and perspective.<br />\nThe student artists used very bright and<br />\nloud colors, most of which are the<br />\nprimary colors. Thus some paintings are<br />\nharsh to the eye. In addition, there are<br />\nembarrassing signs that some of the artists<br />\nhad real difficulty dealing with<br />\nperspective. Another disappointment is<br /><br />\nthe procession of vases and bowls of fruit<br />\nwhich become interchangeable. Some of<br />\nthe paintings are failures, but still, this is<br />\nno ordinary museum.<br />\nThe specific scenes of the pastorals are<br />\nalso less than inspirational, but they<br />\nremain remarkable if you take into \u2022<br />\ndifferent techniques of the medium are<br />\nused to great advantage in these paintings,<br />\nand they add to the grotesque quality of<br /><br />\nthese works. Disjionted eyeballs, gigantic<br />\nturbines, and trees floating in the air<br />\nprovide aggressive scenes. One series of<br />\nfour pictures by an eighteen-year-old can<br />\nonly be described as \"abstract rainbows.\"<br />\nTogether they display a brilliant,<br />\nbeautiful merging and dissolving of color.<br />\nThe paintings in the series blend together;<br />\nthe frames might as well not be there.<br />\nThe most successful paintings on<br /><br />\naccount the fact that most of the Model<br />\nCities neighborhoods are the hard-core<br />\ninner city areas. The environment<br />\ndepicted in the pastorals is almost<br />\ndiametrically opposite to that of the<br />\nhomes of the artists.<br />\nSome of thc paintings are<br />\nhonest-to-goodness crazy (surrealistic is<br />\nthe conventional word). Odd, harsh<br />\nshapes and gross, evil distortions exist in<br />\nthe artists' visual presentation. The<br />\ndisplay are the portraits. Many are quite<br />\ngood, a few are excellent, and one or two<br />\ncan only be called remarkable,<br />\nparticularly when the minimum of formal<br />\ntraining that these artists have had is<br />\ntaken into account. One of these,<br />\nstrategically located by the entrance, is<br />\ndefinitely the show stopper. It's a simple<br />\nblack and white study in silhouette of a<br />\nstrikingly beautiful Black girl with an<br />\nafro. It's hard to imagine anyone simply<br />\nwalking by it.<br />\nAs a whole the exhibit makes a<br />\nbrilliant display of what urban aid<br />\nprograms (such as the Model Cities<br />\nprogram) can achieve. The next time that<br />\na legislator suggests that such programs<br />\nshould be curtailed, take him down to<br />\nOne Charles Center.

Maryland<br />\nvoters will decide whether or not<br />\nthey will allow private and<br />\ndenominational schools to<br />\ncontinue receiving state aid.<br />\nLast year the Maryland State<br />\nLegislature passed a bill providing<br />\nS12.1 million annually to<br />\nnon-public schools. While 101<br />\nlegislators voted for the passage,<br />\nthere was enough public reaction<br />\nto bring the matter before the<br />\nvoters in a referendum in this<br />\nyear's general election.<br />\nThe vote on Referendum<br />\nQuestion 18 will determine<br />\nwhether or not aid to non-public<br />\nschools is to be continued.<br />\nAt present, the bill is designed<br />\nto aid lower and middle income<br />\nfamilies by granting sums of $75<br />\nto $200 depending on their<br />\nincome. Only families with<br />\nadjusted incomes under $12,000<br />\nare eligible for aid. The adjusted<br />\nincome is derived from the gross<br />\nincome minus $800 for each<br />\ndependent.<br />\nLeading the drive to cut off<br />\nthe aid is The Maryland<br />\nCommittee for Public Education<br />\nand Religious Liberty,(PEARL).<br /><br />\nAndrew D'Elia, treasurer of<br />\nPEARL, was unavailable for<br />\nconunent.<br />\nThe American Civil Liberties<br />\nUnion (ACLU) of Maryland and<br />\nAmericans United for Separation<br />\nof Church and State are among<br />\nseveral organizations sponsoring<br />\nthis effort.<br />\nJohn Roemer of the ACLU<br />\nstated that the basic issue is the<br />\nConstitutional provision of the<br />\nseparation of church and state.<br />\nThe contention is that the \u2022<br />\nMaryland bill violates this<br />\nprovision and that the state<br />\ncannot provide funds to church<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe criticism of aid to<br />\nnon-public schools is essentially<br />\ndirected at Catholic schools<br />\nwhich present a religiously<br />\noriented education.<br />\nRegarding aid to private,<br />\nnon-denominational schools,<br />\nRoemer said that they could<br />\nreceive aid, but only if certain<br />\ncriteria are met.

The ACLU was<br />\nquite active in lobbying against<br />\n\"initially the amount is less if aid<br />\nthe measure while it was under<br />\nis granted to the non-public<br />\nschools.\" But he suggested that<br />\nconsideration.

The Blue Jay defense<br />\nfeatures an excellent secondary<br />\nof Harry Stringer, Les Mathews<br />\n(\"improved 200% last year\"),<br />\nand Billy Nolan, all returning as a<br />\nunit from last year.<br />\nLeading the linebacking squad<br />\nare Gunter Glocker and Jim<br />\nMoran, who watch the middle,<br />\nwhile Craig Stevens and Richard<br />\nHagerty watch the outside, but<br />\nplay on the line, inside the ends,<br />\nin Coach Cox's 6-2-3 alignment.<br />\nIn the front four, the Jays will<br />\nfield steady Bruce Jackson and<br />\nwuick Rick Kuehn at ends. Mike<br />\nO'Brien and Keith Krantz at<br />\ntackles will be bearing the brunt<br />\nof opposition running attacks.<br />\nWhile the Jays will be fielding<br />\nbasically the same personnel as<br />\nlast year, with more experience,<br />\nMuhlenberg will be showing<br />\nHopkins a different face.<br />\nThey still have wide receiver<br />\nGeorge Wheeler, who hauled<br />\ndown a last-second 61 -yard pass<br />\nin last year's game to set up the<br />\nwinning touchdown. But gone is<br />\nthe man who threw that pass,<br />\nquarterback Ed DiYanni, last<br />\nyear's MAC total offense leader.<br />\nWith his passing arm missing,<br />\nMuhlenberg will be expected to<br />\nrun more often this year.<br />\nThe Allentown team's<br />\nstrength, though, is in its defense.<br />\nLike Hopkins, their defensive<br />\nsecondary is returning intact and<br />\nin good shape. They also feature<br />\ntwo excellent linebackers, Easen<br />\nand Schneider.<br />\nNevertheless, for Coach Cox,<br />\nthe key to tomorrow afternoon's<br />\ngame lies in Hopkins offensive<br />\npower. He hopes to establish at<br />\nleast one good running play early<br /><br />\nin the game which Muhlenberg<br />\nhas to stop, and then exploit<br />\nwhat weaknesses they leave open<br />\nwhen they try to compensate.<br />\nHere, the positions to watch are<br />\nthe Jays' offensive tackles, to see<br />\nhow well they can immobilize<br />\ntheir opponents and make<br />\noff-tackle and outside plays<br />\nwork.<br />\nDefensively, the Blue Jays will<br />\nhave to stop Muhlenberg's<br />\nrunning game. Cox sees the left<br />\nside of the defensive line (Kuehn,<br />\nStevens, O'Brien) as playing the<br />\nkey role.<br />\nIn summing up the team's<br />\nchances, the coach, not wanting<br />\nto appear over-confident, was<br />\nhesitant to predict victory. And<br />\nrightfully so. Muhlenberg has<br />\nonly played once in scrimmage<br />\nand it is too difficult to evaluate<br />\nthem just yet. Hopkins has good<br />\npersonnel, but by no means do<br />\nthe Jays have a big edge in that<br />\ndepartment.<br /><br />\nBig Jay Gridman Sam Palmasano<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nspoRTs<br /><br />\nSix thinclads return for season<br />\nbecause they enjoy the running<br />\nBy GERRY GREENFIELD<br />\nOn every team there is a group<br />\nwho, through their dedication,<br />\nperserverence and potential, form<br />\na nucleus of talent: the Hopkins<br />\ncross country is no exception.<br />\nTheir nucleus is composed of six<br />\nsophomores, all of whom were<br />\non the team last year.

Although he runs track in<br />\nthe spring, Jeff maintains that his<br />\nmain sport is cross country<br />\nbecause it is less boring than<br />\ntrack.

After<br />\ntheir first meeting, each team put<br />\n'a \"one\" under the \"tie\" column<br />\nof their season records. Last year<br />\nwas a bit different, however, with<br />\nthe Blue Jays walking away with<br />\na four to one victory.<br />\nHaverford has always been a<br />\nstrong finishing team, starting<br /><br />\ntheir season slowly and gradually<br />\nimproving, then coming on<br />\nstrong in the end. At the end of<br />\nlast year's season, they beat<br />\nsecond place Swarthmore by a<br />\nscore of six to one. This allowed<br />\nthem to share the fourth place<br />\nslot in the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference with the Blue Jay<br />\nteam.<br />\nNine of the eleven starters of<br />\ntheir 1971 team will be retumin<br /><br />\nas opposed to eight of Hopkins.<br />\nHaverford did, however, make a<br />\nchange of coaches.

This<br />\nyear, of course, the Jays have<br />\nadded more talent and appear to<br />\nhave better team work. On the<br />\noffense, Hopkins moves the ball<br />\nwith more finesse than some of<br />\nits more recent teams, but the<br />\nfinal touch of putting the ball<br />\ninto the net is still missing.<br />\nThe top two \"finishers\" on the<br />\nBlue Jay team are senior Marc<br />\nManzione and junior Robert<br />\nArguero who have both improved<br />\nconsiderably over the last few<br />\nscrimmages. The offense has<br />\nshown its ability to move the ball<br />\nup to the opponent's net, and<br />\nnow mast prove that it does<br />\nindeed have the ability to put the<br />\nball into the goal.<br />\nAdvantage<br />\nThe game should undoubtedly<br />\nbe close with the home field<br />\nadvantage going to Haverford.<br />\nHopkins, however, has a great<br />\nteam spirit which, in their type<br />\nof ball game, can make the<br />\ndifference between a win and a<br />\nloss.<br /><br />\ntallest man on the team at 6'4\"<br />\nand in spite of the fact that tall<br />\nmen are few in cross country has<br />\nreturned for a second year.

In<br />\naddition, it was felt that the<br />\nconfusion raised by the variety<br />\nand scope of the different bills<br />\nhindered any attempts at passage.<br />\nWhile drinking age proposals<br />\nnaturally gained support from<br />\nyoung people across the state, no<br />\ncommittee testimony was given<br />\nby any University.
