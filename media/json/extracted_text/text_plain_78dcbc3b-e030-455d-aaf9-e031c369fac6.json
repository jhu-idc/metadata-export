LXX, NO. 7<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, NOVEMBER 12, 1965<br />\n<br />\nL. R.P. C. Continued<br />\nBy MEL SHUSTER<br />\nThe present status of undergraduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins is not as tenuous<br />\nas some would have us believe; on the<br />\ncontrary, it is comparable to that of a<br />\nvery real institution whose purpose and<br />\nmechanisms are currently under extensive re-evaluation.<br />\nTwo men who play major roles in determining the future of the undergraduate body are Dean Robert Strider,<br />\nAssociate Dean of the faculty of philosophy, and Dr. M. Gordon Wolman, professor of geography and head of the undergraduate Long Range Planning Committee.<br />\nAsked what part the students themselves will play in the examination of<br />\nthe undergraduate community, Dean<br />\nStrider pointed out that this year there<br />\nwill be no established subcommittee as<br />\nthere was last year, when a selected<br />\nnumber of students were able to present<br />\ntheir views to the undergraduate LRPC.<br />\nHowever, he is presently considering the<br />\ncreation of a mechanism whereby any<br />\ngroup of students with concrete ideas<br />\nmay meet with him to discuss their proposals, in effect constituting a temporary student advisory committee.<br />\nThe idea was originated when five<br />\nmembers of the new defunct student<br />\nLRPC subcommittee, led by Boyce Kendrick and Barry Gould, met with the<br />\nDean during orientation. \"Two concrete<br />\nproposals came out of this discussion,\" said Dean Strider.<br />\n\"First, it was agreed that some<br />\nmethod should be provided to<br />\nsatisfy intense student interest in<br />\nsurvey courses, either through<br />\nor<br />\nsections<br />\nof<br />\nsegregation<br />\nthrough the option of additional<br />\nwork. Second, we are seriously<br />\nconsidering the formation of an<br />\nhumanities program leading to<br />\nan A.B. degree.\" This matter is<br />\nnow being considered by the executive committee on the A.B.<br />\ndegree,, of which Dean Strider is<br />\nchairman.<br />\nAdmissions Policy<br />\nOne critical area that Dean Strider<br />\npointed to was that of admissions. He<br />\nadmitted that the University has been<br />\nmore occupied with attrition of students<br />\nalready here, emphasizing the \"throughput over the input.\" With the increase<br />\nIn applications and acceptances, and<br />\nthe apparent desire to place greater emphasis on the humanities, he stated that<br />\ngreater attention will be given admissions. Any change, he 'predicted, would<br />\noccur through a change in the relative<br />\ndistribution of students admitted, rather<br />\nthan a flat increase in the number of<br />\nnon-science oriented students.<br />\nThe Dean placed special emphasis<br />\nupon the distinction between the functions of the LRPC and the administration, stating that while both are naturally concerned with the future of the<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins, the former<br />\ncan only make recommendations, while<br />\nIt is the administration which implements such suggestions and thus has the<br />\nfinal word. He said that the administration currently has a few plans which<br />\nIt plans to put into effect within the<br />\nnext month. but he declined to specify<br />\nwhat they are.<br />\nProblems Apparent<br />\nDr. Wolman, who heads the undergraduate Long Range Planning ComMittee, believes that \"current educational problems have made it clear that<br />\nwe had better find out what the undergraduates are interested in.\" Last<br />\nyear, he says, served to lay the groundwork for the forthcoming deliberations<br />\n<br />\nof the committee. Most of the time, he<br />\nexplains, was occupied In discussing the<br />\nmerits of undergraduate education, and<br />\nonly after \"protracted discussion was a<br />\ndecision reached that undergraduates<br />\nare important. I emphasize that it was<br />\na decision, not fiat.\" According to Dr.<br />\nWolman, some felt that the University's<br />\nprimary interests lie in the graduate<br />\nschools, although the majority finally<br />\nagreed on the Hopkins commitment to<br />\nthe undergraduate body.<br />\nA former Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nhimself, Dr. Wolman sees general education as the most challenging and<br />\ncomplicated problem facing the committee. Although he is not \"one hundred<br />\nper cent convinced,\" he feels that \"requirements should be made more flexible,\" allowing students greater freedom<br />\nto specialize, if they so desire. Such was<br />\nthe case under the Bronk Plan, instituted by the Hopkins president who<br />\nserved from 1952 to the advent of the<br />\npresent administration, when the program was scrapped. The problem, Dr.<br />\nWolman admits, is that \"students become dissatisfied if they don't know<br />\nwhat is required.\" The answer, he feels,<br />\nstill lies in changing requirements<br />\nrather than simply adding courses.<br />\nAlternatives<br />\nDr. Wolman pointed out that other<br />\nalternatives also exist.

The<br />\nconference centers around the work<br />\nthat is being done to promote better<br />\nconditions in the slum areas. Students<br />\nfrom college campuses in the Central<br />\nAtlantic region have been invited to<br />\nparticipate in the conference.<br />\nHighlighting the conference will be<br />\na major address by Mr. Saul Alinsky,<br />\nhead of Chicago's Industrial Areas<br />\nFoundation, Sunday at 2:00 P.M. in<br />\nthe Levering Great Hall. Mr. Alinsky<br />\nwill speak on \"Organizing the Community for the War on Poverty\" as<br />\npart of the Elmore B. Jeffery Lecture<br />\nSeries.<br />\nThe conference is part of the \"Y\"'s<br />\nIncreased involvement in this area. This<br />\nfall, more than ever before, the \"Y\"<br />\nhas become deeply involved in social<br />\naction programs in Metropolitan Baltimore. One of the chief reasons for<br />\nthis increased role in city-wide community projects is the newly organized<br />\nVolunteer Tutorial Agency Council of<br />\nMetropolitan Baltimore, of which Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire, the \"Y's\" Executive<br />\nSecretary, is the acting chairman. The<br />\nCouncil held a successful Tutor Orientation Workshop at Levering Hall on<br />\nOctober 23, which brought together over<br />\n300 tutors from all over Baltimore.<br />\nThis response to the \"Y's\" programs<br />\nfrom the city has been tremendous. Indicative of this widespread support for<br />\nthe program is the participation in this<br />\nweekend's conference. Leadership for<br />\nthe conference will include officials<br />\nfrom Baltimore's Community Action<br />\nProgram and the Vista Program, both<br />\n<br />\nplacement examinations could be given,<br />\nemphasizing the absolving of requirements rather than acquiring a certain<br />\nnumber of'credits. He gave theexample<br />\nof a plan currently employed at Princeton, where a student may opt one course<br />\nwithout being graded for it, while receiving grades in his major area of<br />\nstudy.<br />\nThe overcrowding of 300 level courses<br />\nand the unappealing dormitory conditions are perhaps the only detrimental<br />\naspects upon which most people will<br />\nagree, according to Dr. Wolman. \"Granting these points, where do you go from<br />\nhere?\" One common dissatisfaction<br />\nvoiced is that of poor faculty-student<br />\nrelations. Observes Dr. Wolman, \"I<br />\ndon't think it has dawned on some students that they wouldn't really want<br />\ncontact with professors to the degree<br />\nthey have said. Professors are not Rotarians, and the best way to get to know<br />\na professor is not at a faculty-student<br />\ntea, assuming he bothers to come at. all.\"<br />\nObtaining student opinion on these<br />\ntopics may prove to be a major difficulty, he feels. Even with a committee of<br />\ncampus leaders or interested undergraduates, the majority still will remain<br />\nunheard. Dr. Wolman believes that<br />\nmany students who undoubtedly have<br />\nvalid criticisms and suggestions have<br />\nalienated themselves from the campus<br />\ncommunity and would be hard to reach.<br />\nAt this point, Dr. Wolman registers his<br />\njustified uncertainty as to how this<br />\nproblem will be overcome.<br />\n<br />\n70TH YEAR<br />\n<br />\nof which are parts of the federal government's Economic Opportunity Act,<br />\nbetter known as the War on Poverty.<br />\nThe keynote address will be shared<br />\nby three men: Dr. Harris Chaiklin and<br />\nDr. Ray Berham of the University of<br />\nMaryland School of Social Work, and<br />\nMr. Edward Holmgreen, Executive Director of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc.<br />\nAppeals To Students<br />\nCorresponding to this increased interest in these projects has been a sharp<br />\ndemand for students to do the necessary<br />\nwork. Every day the \"Y\" receives appeals for students to work as volunteers,<br />\nespecially as tutors, in a variety of<br />\ncommunity service programs all over<br />\nthe city. At present there are twenty<br />\nvolunteer tutors who axe working an<br />\naverage of four hours pei week in this<br />\nprogram. Since the October 23 con-<br />\n<br />\nference Levering Hall has become the<br />\noperating headquarters for the Tutorial<br />\nCouncil, which has resulted in the large<br />\nnumber of requests for tutors to serve<br />\nin a variety of capacities. The need is<br />\nsuch, that another fifty students could<br />\nbe used to implement tutoring and<br />\ncommunity service programs, which<br />\nLevering Hall has been asked to sponsor.<br />\nAt the present time, these are the<br />\nrequests requiring immediate action:<br />\nAn urban project in West Baltimore<br />\nneeds seven tutors to work with junior<br />\nand senior high school students. The<br />\ntutors for this project are needed espe.<br />\ndaily for mathematics subjects.<br />\nA center, which provides social re..<br />\nhabilitation for persons returning from<br />\nmental hospitals, needs student volun.<br />\nteers to work with the out-patients---.<br />\nto help them make a positive adjust.<br />\nment to the workaday world.<br />\nAlso, a Community Chest home for<br />\nemotionally disturbed boys needs about<br />\nfifteen volunteers. The home would like<br />\nto recruit students who could help set<br />\nup and run a workshop in electronics<br />\nand woodworking.<br />\nThese are the kinds of appeals which<br />\nLevering Hall receives each week. What<br />\nIs urgently needed, according to Dr.<br />\nWickwire, are responsible, mature stu.<br />\ndents, who are willing to volunteer a<br />\nportion of their time and skills to work<br />\nin these programs.<br />\nAlInsky Speaks<br />\nSaul Alinsky, who will speak Sunda?<br />\nin Levering Hall on \"Organizing the<br />\nCommunity for the War on Poverty,'<br />\nsees grave faults in the implementing<br />\nof the Economic Opportunity Act of<br />\n1964.<br />\nAccording to Alinsky, money that<br />\nshould, in his opinion, be appropriated<br />\nto organize the poor behind militant<br />\nleaders in order to fight City Hall is<br />\nbeing used to buy off these leaders<br />\nand line the pockets of city officials as<br />\nwell.

In 1939, after an<br />\nabortive career in criminology,<br />\nhe entered the field of community<br />\norganization, exhorting,<br />\n\"people don't get opportunity or freedom or equality or dignity as a gift or<br />\nan act of charity<br />\nYou need organization \u2014 first to compel concessions, and<br />\nsecond, to make the other side deliver.\"<br />\nFollowing this principle, and with<br />\nthe financial aid of Chicago business<br />\nmagnate Marshall Field, Minsky found.<br />\ned the Industrial Areas Foundation<br />\n,(IAF).

A rid rew Wallach, Richard Friedman.<br />\n<br />\nTruth, Justice and The<br />\nAmerican Way<br />\nAfter four years at Hopkins the structure of American education has finally become apparent. The basic<br />\nelement in the American Educational System is intimidation. Professors present students with much more<br />\nwork than they are capable of handling in any sort of<br />\nadequate capacity. In this way, regardless of the amount<br />\nof work the student does, there is always more that<br />\ncan be done, in this way the professor has raised the<br />\nsceptor of guilt over the student's head so that regardless of his contentiousness the student is obliged to work<br />\neven harder. This of course creates among the students<br />\nwho are susceptible to intimidation the old demeanor<br />\nof the Engine That Could. It was not often that one could<br />\nenter the corrals during exams freshman year without<br />\nsensing the intense academics chugging away at their<br />\nstudies. After several days many of the conscientious<br />\nstudiers were faced with the realization that they had<br />\nbeen given too much work. Occasionally students reacted<br />\nIn fits of mental aberration\u2014sobbing, crying, oral fixating etc. All this of course was to no avail, but it did<br />\nhappen. The other less intensely intimidated, or the<br />\noriented students managed to escape this consumation. They were able to study right up to the exam.<br />\nGood.<br />\nRightfully, the intended result of this scholastic intimidhtion is an inducement to study, but in some cases<br />\nthese well laid reading lists have gone astray, and the<br />\nreaction of the students luis been somewhat less than<br />\nacademic.<br />\nEach semester the Honor Commission publishes<br />\nIts quota of students who have reacted to the intimidation<br />\nby cheating. While this practice goes highly unrecommended we are sure that it is practiced with great<br />\nalacrity by more students than are intimated by the honor<br />\ncommissioner's roster.<br />\nThe fact that cheating can he (at times) a successful solution to the academic pressure in American Universities leads to another basic concept regarding the<br />\nsystem. Grades indicate the success or failure of the<br />\nstudent in the various courses. Therefore, it seems plausible that if a student can successfully attain good grades<br />\nhe succeeds within the system. This may occur with or<br />\nwithout studying, with or without cheating.<br />\nSince professors are old by profession, they have<br />\nalready established set patterns of requirements. The<br />\nstudy of a professor's past is inordinately helpful to the<br />\nstudent who wishes to succeed in his course (we are told).<br />\nEssentially the system is reduced to a conflict between<br />\nthe student and the professor, but in many eases the<br />\nstudent has ascended to the prominent role. The student has come to recognize patterns in the professor's<br />\nwork and thus phyche out the profs exams.<br />\nWe are pessimistic toward the possibility of any<br />\nimprovements in the system. But if we should be caught<br />\nsaying that there was any real solution to this sad<br />\n\"state of game\" between students and faculty, we would<br />\nbe harboring an unrealistic hope.<br />\nWe wish it to be enough to state that such a futile<br />\ngame exists, that a student should not have to huff anti<br />\npuff to blow the door of knowledge down. We hoe<br />\nthat this statement of opinion will bring on some mitigttion of our grievance; anti that students will someday<br />\nbe given a due to the key to knowledge, 40 they can<br />\nF\u00b0 in the front door.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 12, 1966<br />\n<br />\nBy HENRY J. KORN<br />\nWhen faced with the prospect<br />\nof announcing the date of a<br />\nmid-term examination the Johns<br />\nHopkins professor, a reasonably<br />\neloquent fellow (Woodrow Wilson), hitches his trousers, fumbles with the water faucet, fondles a stub of chalk, then launches an incoherent apology for the<br />\nmethods and practices of the<br />\nconstipated American academic<br />\ncommunity.<br />\n\"I wish we didn't have to give<br />\nexaminations\" muses Dr. Jecklye with the Ph.D. \"If it were UP<br />\nto me, I wouldn't give examinations.\" \"But\", (it's only a matter of time before he reverses<br />\nhis field), \"the registrar asks for<br />\ngrades.\" Thus our pipe-sucking<br />\nfriend martyrs himself before<br />\nthe omniscient will of Miss Davis,<br />\nand finishes his lecture with an<br />\nair of discomfort, restless in his<br />\ntweed lined hair shirt.<br />\nThe most reasonable rationale<br />\nfor the impositon of an examination is that it is the only practical way to rank large numbers<br />\nof students. Since, however, most<br />\nof the questions that appear on<br />\nthe average exam, seem to have<br />\nbeen chosen in a random lottery it might be also logical to<br />\ninclude in a new system of<br />\ngrading the other rules that are<br />\nset forth in the standard Shred-<br />\n<br />\nded Wheat Box contest.<br />\nUpon presentation of the official University box-top (the<br />\nclass card) together with nine<br />\nhundred dollars in coin (or check<br />\nor money order \u2014 no stamps<br />\nplease!), the entrant shall be<br />\nrequired to complete the sentence \"Why I know the material<br />\npresented in the course thus far\"<br />\nor improvise a jingle of un-<br />\n<br />\nWho<br />\n<br />\nNose?<br />\n<br />\nBy HocK<br />\nThe latest number of Esquire,<br />\nthat great magazine which was<br />\ngrand-dad's Playboy, contains a<br />\nvery provocative article about<br />\nwhat is described as cosmetic<br />\nsurgery, but what is more commonly thought of as \"having a<br />\nnose job\". It seems that the state<br />\nof the art is being advanced in<br />\nleaps and bounds, and that now,<br />\nrather than having your nose<br />\nredone to fit your body, you can<br />\nhave your entire body redone<br />\nto fit your nose. To be sure, this<br />\nreporter viewed these reports<br />\nwith great joy, but one.can only<br />\nimagine the Heights of ecstacy<br />\nto which we rose when we discovered that much of this important work is being done almost in our, very midst, at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital.

The flute, an instrument infrequently featured for<br />\nover a century, was given a<br />\nsound bid fbr popularity last<br />\nSunday.<br />\nMost of us have either never<br />\nheard a flute seriously played, or<br />\nhave heard it only with piano<br />\naccompaniment, an unfortunate<br />\ncombination. The harpsichord<br />\nhas the lightness and precision<br />\nto most effectively set off the<br />\nrather unique problems the flute<br />\npresents. For this reason the<br />\nShriver Hall concert was a very<br />\npleasant surprise to the many<br />\nwho had looked on the flute as<br />\nonly a lateral whistle or an ad-<br />\n<br />\nlimited length to whatever tune<br />\nhe thinks he can get away with.<br />\nThe professor shall then be required to average the results<br />\nwith certain other appropriate<br />\ncriteria. \"Aptness of thought\"<br />\nshall be measured by how well a<br />\nstudent performs against the<br />\nothers sitting in his row of seats.<br />\nHow well does a first row person<br />\nmaintain an expression of all<br />\nconsuming interest and sympathy<br />\nof intellect? How does the skill<br />\nof the second row people compare in the phrasing of questions<br />\nto which they already know the<br />\nanswers? How well do the fifth<br />\nrow members resist the temptation to look back at the clock?<br />\n\"Neatness\" might be credited<br />\nto the students who manage to<br />\nshave consistently before an<br />\neight o'clock class (actually,<br />\ncredit should be -given to anyone<br />\nwho manages to show up consistently for an eight o'clock<br />\nClass). \"Originality\" might be<br />\ncredited to those who roll up<br />\ntheir pajama bottoms to make<br />\nit look like they have Bermuda<br />\nshorts on under their raincoats.<br />\nNo entries, shall of course, be<br />\nreceived after the drop date. The<br />\ndecision of the judges is presupposed as being final, unless<br />\nyou happen to have a useful<br />\nacquaintance with the omnipotent Miss Davis.<br />\n<br />\njunct of the Brandenberg Concertos.<br />\nLecroix demonstrated the great<br />\nflexibility of the harpsichord as<br />\nIs rarely understood. Though recently gaining in popularity, the<br />\nharpsichord is still largely known<br />\nonly through recordings, which<br />\noften steal much of its subtlety.<br />\nThe program was composed<br />\nentirely of intellectually oriented<br />\nBaroque works. In this abstract<br />\nand complex setting the duo<br />\nfascinated the entire audience<br />\nfrom their first note. The intimacy of this time honored combination could not have been<br />\nmore effectively demonstrated.<br />\nIts vitality and charm were explored with imagination and<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nRampal and Lacroix reached<br />\nan expressive high in Telemann's<br />\nSonata in F minor at the end<br />\n(Continued on Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nenforced, realigned, and rejuvinated.

Perhaps the day will<br />\ncome when ' everybody will roll<br />\nin to his local hospital every two<br />\nthousand hours to have a lube<br />\njob, and to check his plugs and<br />\npoints.<br />\nNeedless to say, we found this<br />\nintriguing, and decided to do<br />\nsome independent motivational<br />\nresearch, to find why the Hopkins is involved in this work. The<br />\nanswer is plain; it is a scientific<br />\neffort whch most Hoppies will<br />\nhail with great rejoicing. It is a<br />\nproject to create a better girl.<br />\nThe thesis under which the<br />\nHoppie Pygmalions are working<br />\nhas been called the M and M<br />\nthesis. Briefly, it is this: If<br />\nMohammed wouldn't go to the<br />\nmountain, the mountain must<br />\ncome to Mohammed.<br />\nTwo things have become painfully clear of late, first that<br />\nGoucher is here to stay, and<br />\nsecond that it corners a substancial part of the girl market.<br />\nWith this thought in mind, the<br />\nHoppie Scientists decided that<br />\nthey must improve the typical<br />\nGoucher girl, if life at the Hop<br />\nis to be blissful, as advertised in<br />\nthe catalogue. It seems that<br />\nthere is a need for better women<br />\nto be made, and Hopkins men<br />\nwill make them.<br />\nThe future implications of this<br />\nwork are staggering, and could<br />\ncause many problems. Imagine<br />\ngoing to a mixer and not feeling<br />\nlike you are in a kennel. Imagine<br />\nseeing the library filled with<br />\nshining new faces, freshly sanded, even SDS demonstrations<br />\nwould take on a new air of<br />\nbeauty. It would however, make<br />\nit hard to choose, and would<br />\neliminate from life the challenge<br />\nof seeking pretty girls.<br />\nViewing this over a future long<br />\nrun, it seems that the losses<br />\nmight over-ride the gains.

(The first gravest problem is,<br />\nof course, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority<br />\nhouse canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority feelings and their possible cures.<br />\nPsychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal categories:<br />\nI. Physical inferiority.<br />\n2. Mental inferiority.<br />\n3. Financial inferiority.<br />\n(A few say there is also a fourth category:ichthyological<br />\ninferiority\u2014a feeling that other people have prettier fish\u2014<br />\nbut I believe this is common only along the coasts and in<br />\nthe Great Lakes area.)<br />\nLet us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined<br />\nto feel inferior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful homecoming queen. But we should not. Look at all the<br />\npeople, neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their<br />\nmarks in the world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates.<br />\nLook at Caesar. Look at Lassie.<br />\nWhat I mean is you can't always tell what's inside a<br />\npackage by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course,<br />\nyou can. Take Personna Stainless Steel Blades, for example. Just one glance at that jolly blue and white package\u2014<br />\nso bright and pert, so neat but not gaudy\u2014and you know it<br />\nhas to contain blades of absolute perfection.

Visit your friendly<br />\nPersonna dealer today to get details and an entry blank.)<br />\nBut I digress. Let us turn now to the second category\u2014<br />\nmental inferiority. A lot of people think they are,dumber<br />\nthan other people. This is not so. It must be remembered<br />\nthat there are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothersi Claude and<br />\nSturbridge, students at a prominent Western university<br />\n(Dartmouth). It was always assumed that Claude was the<br />\nmore intelligent just because he knew more than Sturbridge<br />\nabout the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the humanities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten<br />\ntimes smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny<br />\nknots. But no matter; everybody looked down on \"Stupid<br />\nSturbridge,\" as they called him, and looked up to \"Clever<br />\nClaude,\" as they called him. But who do you think turned<br />\nout to be the smart one when their granny almost got loose<br />\nand ran away? You guessed it\u2014good old Stupid Sturbridge.<br />\nWe arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.<br />\nOne way to deal with this condition is to increase your income. You can, for example, become a fence. Or you can<br />\npose for a life class, if your college is well heated.<br />\nBut a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept it philosophically. Look on the bright side of pOverty.<br />\nTrue, others may have more money than you have, but<br />\nlook at all the things you have that they don't\u2014debts, for<br />\ninstance, and hunger cramps.<br />\nAlways remember, dear friends, that poverty is no disgrace.

No<br />\ndoubt these claims are valid, because if all the candidates of the<br />\nfootball team were healthy now,<br />\nthe squad's record would be considerably improved.<br />\nOf the forty-four men out for<br />\nthe squad, scarcely half are now<br />\nhealthy. Looking over the past<br />\nfew years I find that this situation is not the exception but<br />\nthe rule. Two years ago the football team was plagued by injuries. Jerry Pfeifer broke his<br />\nLauren<br />\nScheffenacker<br />\narm,<br />\nsprained an ankle, and Joe Viglotti broke an ankle just to start.<br />\nNeedless to say the poor showing that year was blamed on<br />\ninjuries.<br />\nLast year and again this year<br />\nsimilar situations have developed.<br />\n<br />\nA quick check with other schools<br />\nin this area discloses that injuries are common throughout,<br />\nbut no school has been plagued<br />\nwith the consistent bad luck that<br />\nHopkins has. I realize that football is rough, but is the consistently high injury rate at Hopkins<br />\npurely bad luck?<br />\nIn lacrosse the problem is the<br />\nsame. In 1963 Mike Oidick had<br />\nan annoying muscle pull and defenseman Dave MacCool was out<br />\nwith a broken leg. The '63 track<br />\nteam too had numerous sprains<br />\nand injuries.<br />\nEveryone wants a winner. And<br />\ninjuries are a valid excuse and<br />\ncan cripple a team at any time.<br />\nBut why is Hopkins continually<br />\nbothered by devastating injuries<br />\nthat substantially hurt the quality of its teams?

LXX, NO. 7<br /><br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, NOVEMBER 12, 1965<br /><br />\nL. R.P. C. Continued<br />\nBy MEL SHUSTER<br />\nThe present status of undergraduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins is not as tenuous<br />\nas some would have us believe; on the<br />\ncontrary, it is comparable to that of a<br />\nvery real institution whose purpose and<br />\nmechanisms are currently under extensive re-evaluation.<br />\nTwo men who play major roles in determining the future of the undergraduate body are Dean Robert Strider,<br />\nAssociate Dean of the faculty of philosophy, and Dr. M. Gordon Wolman, professor of geography and head of the undergraduate Long Range Planning Committee.<br />\nAsked what part the students themselves will play in the examination of<br />\nthe undergraduate community, Dean<br />\nStrider pointed out that this year there<br />\nwill be no established subcommittee as<br />\nthere was last year, when a selected<br />\nnumber of students were able to present<br />\ntheir views to the undergraduate LRPC.<br />\nHowever, he is presently considering the<br />\ncreation of a mechanism whereby any<br />\ngroup of students with concrete ideas<br />\nmay meet with him to discuss their proposals, in effect constituting a temporary student advisory committee.<br />\nThe idea was originated when five<br />\nmembers of the new defunct student<br />\nLRPC subcommittee, led by Boyce Kendrick and Barry Gould, met with the<br />\nDean during orientation. \"Two concrete<br />\nproposals came out of this discussion,\" said Dean Strider.<br />\n\"First, it was agreed that some<br />\nmethod should be provided to<br />\nsatisfy intense student interest in<br />\nsurvey courses, either through<br />\nor<br />\nsections<br />\nof<br />\nsegregation<br />\nthrough the option of additional<br />\nwork. Second, we are seriously<br />\nconsidering the formation of an<br />\nhumanities program leading to<br />\nan A.B. degree.\" This matter is<br />\nnow being considered by the executive committee on the A.B.<br />\ndegree,, of which Dean Strider is<br />\nchairman.<br />\nAdmissions Policy<br />\nOne critical area that Dean Strider<br />\npointed to was that of admissions. He<br />\nadmitted that the University has been<br />\nmore occupied with attrition of students<br />\nalready here, emphasizing the \"throughput over the input.\" With the increase<br />\nIn applications and acceptances, and<br />\nthe apparent desire to place greater emphasis on the humanities, he stated that<br />\ngreater attention will be given admissions. Any change, he 'predicted, would<br />\noccur through a change in the relative<br />\ndistribution of students admitted, rather<br />\nthan a flat increase in the number of<br />\nnon-science oriented students.<br />\nThe Dean placed special emphasis<br />\nupon the distinction between the functions of the LRPC and the administration, stating that while both are naturally concerned with the future of the<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins, the former<br />\ncan only make recommendations, while<br />\nIt is the administration which implements such suggestions and thus has the<br />\nfinal word. He said that the administration currently has a few plans which<br />\nIt plans to put into effect within the<br />\nnext month. but he declined to specify<br />\nwhat they are.<br />\nProblems Apparent<br />\nDr. Wolman, who heads the undergraduate Long Range Planning ComMittee, believes that \"current educational problems have made it clear that<br />\nwe had better find out what the undergraduates are interested in.\" Last<br />\nyear, he says, served to lay the groundwork for the forthcoming deliberations<br /><br />\nof the committee. Most of the time, he<br />\nexplains, was occupied In discussing the<br />\nmerits of undergraduate education, and<br />\nonly after \"protracted discussion was a<br />\ndecision reached that undergraduates<br />\nare important. I emphasize that it was<br />\na decision, not fiat.\" According to Dr.<br />\nWolman, some felt that the University's<br />\nprimary interests lie in the graduate<br />\nschools, although the majority finally<br />\nagreed on the Hopkins commitment to<br />\nthe undergraduate body.<br />\nA former Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nhimself, Dr. Wolman sees general education as the most challenging and<br />\ncomplicated problem facing the committee. Although he is not \"one hundred<br />\nper cent convinced,\" he feels that \"requirements should be made more flexible,\" allowing students greater freedom<br />\nto specialize, if they so desire. Such was<br />\nthe case under the Bronk Plan, instituted by the Hopkins president who<br />\nserved from 1952 to the advent of the<br />\npresent administration, when the program was scrapped. The problem, Dr.<br />\nWolman admits, is that \"students become dissatisfied if they don't know<br />\nwhat is required.\" The answer, he feels,<br />\nstill lies in changing requirements<br />\nrather than simply adding courses.<br />\nAlternatives<br />\nDr. Wolman pointed out that other<br />\nalternatives also exist.

The<br />\nconference centers around the work<br />\nthat is being done to promote better<br />\nconditions in the slum areas. Students<br />\nfrom college campuses in the Central<br />\nAtlantic region have been invited to<br />\nparticipate in the conference.<br />\nHighlighting the conference will be<br />\na major address by Mr. Saul Alinsky,<br />\nhead of Chicago's Industrial Areas<br />\nFoundation, Sunday at 2:00 P.M. in<br />\nthe Levering Great Hall. Mr. Alinsky<br />\nwill speak on \"Organizing the Community for the War on Poverty\" as<br />\npart of the Elmore B. Jeffery Lecture<br />\nSeries.<br />\nThe conference is part of the \"Y\"'s<br />\nIncreased involvement in this area. This<br />\nfall, more than ever before, the \"Y\"<br />\nhas become deeply involved in social<br />\naction programs in Metropolitan Baltimore. One of the chief reasons for<br />\nthis increased role in city-wide community projects is the newly organized<br />\nVolunteer Tutorial Agency Council of<br />\nMetropolitan Baltimore, of which Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire, the \"Y's\" Executive<br />\nSecretary, is the acting chairman. The<br />\nCouncil held a successful Tutor Orientation Workshop at Levering Hall on<br />\nOctober 23, which brought together over<br />\n300 tutors from all over Baltimore.<br />\nThis response to the \"Y's\" programs<br />\nfrom the city has been tremendous. Indicative of this widespread support for<br />\nthe program is the participation in this<br />\nweekend's conference.

A rid rew Wallach, Richard Friedman.<br /><br />\nTruth, Justice and The<br />\nAmerican Way<br />\nAfter four years at Hopkins the structure of American education has finally become apparent. The basic<br />\nelement in the American Educational System is intimidation. Professors present students with much more<br />\nwork than they are capable of handling in any sort of<br />\nadequate capacity. In this way, regardless of the amount<br />\nof work the student does, there is always more that<br />\ncan be done, in this way the professor has raised the<br />\nsceptor of guilt over the student's head so that regardless of his contentiousness the student is obliged to work<br />\neven harder. This of course creates among the students<br />\nwho are susceptible to intimidation the old demeanor<br />\nof the Engine That Could. It was not often that one could<br />\nenter the corrals during exams freshman year without<br />\nsensing the intense academics chugging away at their<br />\nstudies. After several days many of the conscientious<br />\nstudiers were faced with the realization that they had<br />\nbeen given too much work. Occasionally students reacted<br />\nIn fits of mental aberration\u2014sobbing, crying, oral fixating etc. All this of course was to no avail, but it did<br />\nhappen. The other less intensely intimidated, or the<br />\noriented students managed to escape this consumation. They were able to study right up to the exam.<br />\nGood.<br />\nRightfully, the intended result of this scholastic intimidhtion is an inducement to study, but in some cases<br />\nthese well laid reading lists have gone astray, and the<br />\nreaction of the students luis been somewhat less than<br />\nacademic.<br />\nEach semester the Honor Commission publishes<br />\nIts quota of students who have reacted to the intimidation<br />\nby cheating. While this practice goes highly unrecommended we are sure that it is practiced with great<br />\nalacrity by more students than are intimated by the honor<br />\ncommissioner's roster.<br />\nThe fact that cheating can he (at times) a successful solution to the academic pressure in American Universities leads to another basic concept regarding the<br />\nsystem. Grades indicate the success or failure of the<br />\nstudent in the various courses. Therefore, it seems plausible that if a student can successfully attain good grades<br />\nhe succeeds within the system. This may occur with or<br />\nwithout studying, with or without cheating.<br />\nSince professors are old by profession, they have<br />\nalready established set patterns of requirements. The<br />\nstudy of a professor's past is inordinately helpful to the<br />\nstudent who wishes to succeed in his course (we are told).<br />\nEssentially the system is reduced to a conflict between<br />\nthe student and the professor, but in many eases the<br />\nstudent has ascended to the prominent role. The student has come to recognize patterns in the professor's<br />\nwork and thus phyche out the profs exams.<br />\nWe are pessimistic toward the possibility of any<br />\nimprovements in the system. But if we should be caught<br />\nsaying that there was any real solution to this sad<br />\n\"state of game\" between students and faculty, we would<br />\nbe harboring an unrealistic hope.<br />\nWe wish it to be enough to state that such a futile<br />\ngame exists, that a student should not have to huff anti<br />\npuff to blow the door of knowledge down. We hoe<br />\nthat this statement of opinion will bring on some mitigttion of our grievance; anti that students will someday<br />\nbe given a due to the key to knowledge, 40 they can<br />\nF\u00b0 in the front door.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 12, 1966<br /><br />\nBy HENRY J. KORN<br />\nWhen faced with the prospect<br />\nof announcing the date of a<br />\nmid-term examination the Johns<br />\nHopkins professor, a reasonably<br />\neloquent fellow (Woodrow Wilson), hitches his trousers, fumbles with the water faucet, fondles a stub of chalk, then launches an incoherent apology for the<br />\nmethods and practices of the<br />\nconstipated American academic<br />\ncommunity.<br />\n\"I wish we didn't have to give<br />\nexaminations\" muses Dr. Jecklye with the Ph.D. \"If it were UP<br />\nto me, I wouldn't give examinations.\" \"But\", (it's only a matter of time before he reverses<br />\nhis field), \"the registrar asks for<br />\ngrades.\" Thus our pipe-sucking<br />\nfriend martyrs himself before<br />\nthe omniscient will of Miss Davis,<br />\nand finishes his lecture with an<br />\nair of discomfort, restless in his<br />\ntweed lined hair shirt.<br />\nThe most reasonable rationale<br />\nfor the impositon of an examination is that it is the only practical way to rank large numbers<br />\nof students.

(The first gravest problem is,<br />\nof course, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority<br />\nhouse canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority feelings and their possible cures.<br />\nPsychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal categories:<br />\nI. Physical inferiority.<br />\n2. Mental inferiority.<br />\n3. Financial inferiority.<br />\n(A few say there is also a fourth category:ichthyological<br />\ninferiority\u2014a feeling that other people have prettier fish\u2014<br />\nbut I believe this is common only along the coasts and in<br />\nthe Great Lakes area.)<br />\nLet us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined<br />\nto feel inferior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful homecoming queen. But we should not. Look at all the<br />\npeople, neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their<br />\nmarks in the world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates.<br />\nLook at Caesar. Look at Lassie.<br />\nWhat I mean is you can't always tell what's inside a<br />\npackage by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course,<br />\nyou can. Take Personna Stainless Steel Blades, for example. Just one glance at that jolly blue and white package\u2014<br />\nso bright and pert, so neat but not gaudy\u2014and you know it<br />\nhas to contain blades of absolute perfection.

Visit your friendly<br />\nPersonna dealer today to get details and an entry blank.)<br />\nBut I digress. Let us turn now to the second category\u2014<br />\nmental inferiority. A lot of people think they are,dumber<br />\nthan other people. This is not so. It must be remembered<br />\nthat there are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothersi Claude and<br />\nSturbridge, students at a prominent Western university<br />\n(Dartmouth). It was always assumed that Claude was the<br />\nmore intelligent just because he knew more than Sturbridge<br />\nabout the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the humanities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten<br />\ntimes smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny<br />\nknots. But no matter; everybody looked down on \"Stupid<br />\nSturbridge,\" as they called him, and looked up to \"Clever<br />\nClaude,\" as they called him. But who do you think turned<br />\nout to be the smart one when their granny almost got loose<br />\nand ran away? You guessed it\u2014good old Stupid Sturbridge.<br />\nWe arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.<br />\nOne way to deal with this condition is to increase your income. You can, for example, become a fence. Or you can<br />\npose for a life class, if your college is well heated.<br />\nBut a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept it philosophically. Look on the bright side of pOverty.<br />\nTrue, others may have more money than you have, but<br />\nlook at all the things you have that they don't\u2014debts, for<br />\ninstance, and hunger cramps.<br />\nAlways remember, dear friends, that poverty is no disgrace.
