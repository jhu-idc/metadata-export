Their<br />\nideas will not remain in control very<br />\nlong if they allow the forces of destruction to work upon them while<br />\nthey sit idly by. It took a long battle<br />\nto establish these ideals, and it will<br />\ntake at least a bit of defense to maintain them. If they fail, the road leads<br />\nstraight to fascism and war, as has<br />\nbeen amply shown by the World War<br />\nand the recent developments in Europe.

I hope<br />\nwe'll have something next year.\"<br />\nWhile he was concluding this address, B. A. C. was doubling the score<br />\non \"the best St. John's team since<br />\n1931.\" Since the Jays have scrimmaged B. A. C. twice already with<br />\nneither team showing superiority over<br />\nthe other one, even Kels should not<br />\nbe too surprised if his protegees anannex the collegiate title for the<br />\nfourth straight year.<br />\nNo one man stood out for Hopkins.<br />\nThe 19 points were distributed among<br />\nten different men, exemplifying the<br />\nfact that the '35 Blue team will depend on teamwork to carry it through<br />\na triumphal campaign.<br />\nGame Starts Slowly<br />\nThe game started slowly with the<br />\nfield slippery, the skies overcast, and<br />\nthe wind biting. For three minutes<br />\nthere was no scoring, Hopkins having<br />\nthe ball most of the time. Then Henny Houck was sent to the penalty box<br />\nfor a minute during which time his<br />\nconfreres froie the ball. At the end of<br />\nhis minute, Henny scooted towards<br />\nthe goal, received a pass from Dorsey<br />\nYearley, and dented the enemy webbing for the first tally of the afternoon.<br />\nLess than a minute later, the elite<br />\nof the lacrosse world were horrified<br />\nwhen Dick Halvorsen dodged Pete<br />\nSwindell and passed to Lansbergh<br />\nwho promptly knotted the count.<br />\nThe national champions quickly recovered. Johnny Himes, Captain<br />\nCharley Orth, and Bob Levi \u2014 who<br />\nscored twice\u2014registered in that order<br />\nto put the home team in the lead, 5<br />\nto 1, at the end of the first quarter.<br />\nLevi's second goal was the result of<br />\na running dodge in which he sidestepped his man like a broken-field<br />\nrunner.<br />\nThis occurred with only 45 seconds<br />\nto go in the period. At this point,<br />\nCoach Morrill took out five men and<br />\nsubstituted four men. The centres<br />\nfaced-off and play had been going on<br />\nfor about 10 seconds before somebody<br />\ndiscovered that 10 minus 5 plus 4<br />\nequals 9 and not 10.<br />\nTaylor, Halvorsen Score Twice<br />\nTo start the second quarter, Duck<br />\nTaylor scored the first of four goals,<br />\nthis one on a pass from Bucky White.<br />\nHalvorsen, who was never stopped,<br />\ncounted on a long one which was unfortunately screened by Arno Haberkorn.<br />\nPete Bernheim fed Taylor, and in<br />\nwent number two. Once more Halvorsen matched Taylor's goal on another<br />\nsolo attempt.<br />\nYearley and Haberkorn were given<br />\npenalties and Dartmouth was left with<br />\ntwo extra men and only four goals<br />\nbehind, but the Green couldn't take<br />\nadvantage of this opportunity. A few<br />\nminutes later, Tommy Dukehart went<br />\ninto the game, and 10 seconds later<br />\nTommy was in the penalty box, leaving the Indians with an extra man_<br />\nfor two minutes. Still Dartmouth<br />\ncouldn't score.<br />\nThen, with only two minutes to go<br />\nin the initial half, Elm Powell dropped one down on Goalie Clark to end<br />\nthe canto's scoring with Hopkins<br />\nleading, 8 to 3.<br />\nReuling Starts Second Half<br />\nBoth coaches started the second<br />\nhalf with their original teams, except<br />\nthat Lou Reuling was in Hopkins'<br />\ngoal in place of Cliff Gilbert. This half<br />\nbegan with more action than the<br />\nfirst, Captain Orth placing the pill in<br />\nDartmouth's net inside half a minute.<br />\nThen Henny Houck began what he<br />\nhas been doing in practically every<br />\npractice scrimmage: scoring three<br />\ngoals in the first five minutes of play.<br />\nThree Straight For Houck<br />\nFirst it was Levi to Houck.

Dean<br />\nBerry, to whom the letter was addressed, expressed his complete satisfaction with the strike plans as they<br />\nnow stand and regarded the Oath Bill<br />\nprotest as a valuable addition to the<br />\nagenda.<br /><br />\nto illustrate this point, and his personality and character were shown<br />\nto represent the ideal physician in<br />\nthe early part of the twentieth century, as he fulfilled all the essentials<br />\nfor greatness that this period made<br />\nrequisite for the outstanding physician.

At the opening of the<br />\nscene, the lights were out, and Mr.<br />\nKirkpatrick appeared in the wavering<br />\nlight of a meagre candle and in chanting tones proclaimed the doctrine of<br />\nalchemy.

What these things may lead to<br />\nis shown by recent developments in<br />\npolitical realms, from Hitler Germany to \"Hooey\" Louisiana. If the<br />\nliberal thinkers really believe in their<br />\nideals, now is the time to act. Their<br />\nideas will not remain in control very<br />\nlong if they allow the forces of destruction to work upon them while<br />\nthey sit idly by. It took a long battle<br />\nto establish these ideals, and it will<br />\ntake at least a bit of defense to maintain them. If they fail, the road leads<br />\nstraight to fascism and war, as has<br />\nbeen amply shown by the World War<br />\nand the recent developments in Europe. Not a rabid nationalism, but an<br />\nopen-minded attitude, is the means to<br />\npeace.<br />\nThe meeting on Friday, then, should<br />\nnot only be a demonstration against<br />\nthe bill, but should bring us face to<br />\nface with some of the more serious<br />\nproblems of today in respect to both<br />\nscholarship and the threat of war.

For three minutes<br />\nthere was no scoring, Hopkins having<br />\nthe ball most of the time. Then Henny Houck was sent to the penalty box<br />\nfor a minute during which time his<br />\nconfreres froie the ball. At the end of<br />\nhis minute, Henny scooted towards<br />\nthe goal, received a pass from Dorsey<br />\nYearley, and dented the enemy webbing for the first tally of the afternoon.<br />\nLess than a minute later, the elite<br />\nof the lacrosse world were horrified<br />\nwhen Dick Halvorsen dodged Pete<br />\nSwindell and passed to Lansbergh<br />\nwho promptly knotted the count.<br />\nThe national champions quickly recovered.

At this point,<br />\nCoach Morrill took out five men and<br />\nsubstituted four men. The centres<br />\nfaced-off and play had been going on<br />\nfor about 10 seconds before somebody<br />\ndiscovered that 10 minus 5 plus 4<br />\nequals 9 and not 10.<br />\nTaylor, Halvorsen Score Twice<br />\nTo start the second quarter, Duck<br />\nTaylor scored the first of four goals,<br />\nthis one on a pass from Bucky White.<br />\nHalvorsen, who was never stopped,<br />\ncounted on a long one which was unfortunately screened by Arno Haberkorn.<br />\nPete Bernheim fed Taylor, and in<br />\nwent number two. Once more Halvorsen matched Taylor's goal on another<br />\nsolo attempt.<br />\nYearley and Haberkorn were given<br />\npenalties and Dartmouth was left with<br />\ntwo extra men and only four goals<br />\nbehind, but the Green couldn't take<br />\nadvantage of this opportunity. A few<br />\nminutes later, Tommy Dukehart went<br />\ninto the game, and 10 seconds later<br />\nTommy was in the penalty box, leaving the Indians with an extra man_<br />\nfor two minutes. Still Dartmouth<br />\ncouldn't score.<br />\nThen, with only two minutes to go<br />\nin the initial half, Elm Powell dropped one down on Goalie Clark to end<br />\nthe canto's scoring with Hopkins<br />\nleading, 8 to 3.<br />\nReuling Starts Second Half<br />\nBoth coaches started the second<br />\nhalf with their original teams, except<br />\nthat Lou Reuling was in Hopkins'<br />\ngoal in place of Cliff Gilbert.
