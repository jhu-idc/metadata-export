'Fheir avid interest in national and international affairs has gained for those students and universities a wide respect and admiration from their countrymen. The striking difference in attitude toward the<br />\nEuropean student Ps enviously clear to an American<br />\nstudent travelling briefly in Europe. American students,<br />\nby contrast, enjoy little but contempt from informed<br />\nopinion in the United States and abroad. The American<br />\nstudent population, we contend, derives this contempt<br />\nfrom its own apathetic attitude toward issues of real<br />\nimportance.<br />\nIt's sheer nonsense to contend that a university<br />\nstudent council is not competent to give opinions on<br />\nnational and international issues. It's simply an evasion<br />\nof the rather difficult responsibility of keeping one's self<br />\ninformed adequately. It is frightening to think that a<br />\nstudent, living in today's world of dynamic change, could<br />\npossibly abstain from voting on the discrimination issue<br />\non the grounds that he doesn't know enough about racial<br />\nproblems. But that's just what Sophomore representative<br />\nGeorge Elder did.<br />\nThe discrimination issue itself is not of major importance here. What is important is a belated realization<br />\nthat students can and should have opinions and attitudes<br />\nthat deserve recognition by government authorities and<br />\npublic opinion. The Student Council's voice is, admittedly, small and insignificant and the tangible results will<br />\nbe difficult to discern. But, it is a major step in the right<br />\ndirection.<br />\nIronically, the Council's motion, proposed by Fred<br />\nBergerson, vi as apparently more or less a result of<br />\nthe internationally embarassing incidents on U.S. Route<br />\n40 toward New York. However, the racial conditions surrounding the Homewood campus have been quite evident<br />\nto the Council for more than two years now and no<br />\nsimilar action was forthcoming.<br />\n<br />\nWafer, Wafer Everywh'ere<br />\nAt least once every year the annual cry of a \"cultural<br />\ndesert at Ilopk:us\" echoes through the hallowed halls of<br />\nHomewood.

The Second Johns Hopkins poetry festival<br />\nMill he held. Nine major modern poets will be in attendance, and the program will include both lectures and<br />\nreadings.<br />\nThe facts of the matter are that Hopkins is not a<br />\ntotally deprived campus. Last week Ravi Shankar appeared at Shriver Hall. In the near future Paul Tillich<br />\nwill be sponsored in a lecture by the Levering Hall<br />\nMCA, and Ayn Rand will be sponsored by Challenge.<br />\nThat vague entity known as the UniversitY is .not<br />\nresponsible for any cultural desert here at Homewood.<br />\nDuring the past few years consistent efforts have been<br />\nmade to better the intellectual climate on campus.<br />\nIf anyone is at fault it is the average student. Any<br />\nprogram, especially one as extensive as the Poetry festiv al, can not be a success without complete student support. There will be as much cultural activity on this<br />\ncampus as the Hopkins students deserve. If they support<br />\nthe Poetry Festival, the Foreign Film Festival sponsored<br />\nby the YMCA, the SC Assembly program, arta the other<br />\ntalks and meetings held during the year these activities<br />\nwill expand and grow. If they sit in their rooms and<br />\ncomplain, Hopkins will turn into a desert.<br />\n<br />\nBy ROBERT ARELLANO<br />\nTwo ambitions I've had in life<br />\nso far, to study at Hopkins and<br />\nto own a car. The first wasn't<br />\nvery difficult, all I had to do was<br />\nto study hard and get Dad to<br />\nfork over the money.<br />\nThe second one was much<br />\nharder, because the old man<br />\nbought his first car with money<br />\nhe earned while he was in school,<br />\nso he thought I should do the<br />\nsame. Builds up character, boosts<br />\nmorale, gives you a feeling of<br />\naccomplishment, and countless<br />\nother rationalizations which Dad<br />\ncan think of. Of course I could<br />\nhave tried to change his mind,<br />\nbut it's easier to reason with<br />\nFidel Castro, so I decided to earn<br />\nthe money.<br />\nMy first job was washing<br />\npipettes and beakers in the<br />\nChemistry department, but I was<br />\nsoon promoted to feeding guinea<br />\npigs, and ended by being one<br />\nmyself\u2014for their allergy tests.<br />\nBy then I also had a job in the<br />\nPsychology department where<br />\nthey needed subjects for their<br />\nmental tests.<br />\nGreen Slips<br />\nAfter a year of this I had<br />\nenough money for a down payment on a brand new car. That<br />\nfirst day, I proudly drove it<br />\naround the Campus and had no<br />\n<br />\ndifficulty finding a parking space<br />\nalthough some of my friends had<br />\ntold me it was not very easy. By<br />\nfive o'clock when I went to pick<br />\nit up I knew differently. The<br />\ngreen slip on the windshield said<br />\nI was parked in a Faculty lot,<br />\nand that the three dollars were<br />\npayable in Whitehead Hall.<br />\nThe second day I avoided this<br />\nlot and got the green slip for<br />\nparking in an employee lot. The<br />\nthird day was for parking on<br />\nthe grass. There was no slip the<br />\nfourth day, they towed it to<br />\nGreenwood's garage.<br />\nExtra Labor<br />\nThis was proving more expensive than the car payments, so<br />\non the fifth day I started cruising around waiting for someone<br />\nto leave, and sure enough someone did, promptly at eleven. The<br />\nonly problem was that by then<br />\nI had already missed my 9 and<br />\n10 o'clock classes. Obviously<br />\nthis wasn't the answer either,<br />\nfor I couldn't afford to cut two<br />\nclasses a day, so I started arriving at 6:00 A.M.<br />\nBoy, what a difference that<br />\nmade. At least two or three<br />\nchoice spaces were always avails ble\u2022 even at this late hour. But<br />\nthen I started falling asleep in<br />\nall my classes and it wasn't just<br />\nthe early risings but the extra<br />\n<br />\nwork also. In order to keep up<br />\ncar payments, fines and towing<br />\ncharges, I was spending a good<br />\npart of the nights in either the<br />\nChemistry or the Psychology<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nDesperation<br />\nUndoubtedly the situation was<br />\ndesperate and it called for des(Continited on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\nCultural Events<br />\nTheatre<br />\nA Thurber Carnival, Fri., Sat.,<br />\n8:30 P.M., Sat., 2:30 P.M.

If one<br />\ngoes to school for eight semesters, one spends the same<br />\namount, be it in four years or<br />\ntwo and two thirds years. However, if one goes to school three<br />\nsemestprs per year, Daddy is<br />\npaying 10' more than he would<br />\nper year otherwise\u2014at least 504<br />\nmore since the student loses his<br />\nopportunity for summer employment. Let us be reasonable; few<br />\nfathers are gold bricks, and fewer enjoy paying what they are<br />\nnow for a year's education.<br />\nI wonder how many proponents of the tri-semester system have looked at the Summer<br />\nSession catalog. If they did, they<br />\nwould notice that Hopkins at<br />\npresent imports teachers from<br />\nother schools to cover'the courses<br />\noffered.

Perhaps an off-campus organization such as the YSA does<br />\nindeed need a permit to propagandize on'campus, but this rule<br />\nshould be more widely known,<br />\nand not applied in an apparent<br />\nipso facto manner. Mr. Abernathy allegedly also prevented<br />\nthe Committee for Basic Freedoms from appearing at the<br />\nfreshman activities campaign in<br />\nLevering because its members<br />\nwere too emotional to suit his own<br />\npersonal taste. Certainly we are<br />\nmature enough to use our own<br />\njudgement on political matters.<br />\nIf not, then by inference the<br />\nDemocrats and Republicans\u2014<br />\nwhich seem to have Mr. Aber-<br />\n<br />\nnathy's approval\u2014must be the<br />\nonly political philosophies immature enough to serve the level<br />\nof thought at Homewood. Where<br />\ndoes censorshop stop?<br />\nTo speak in absolutes, either<br />\nwe extend our democratic philosophy to everyone, or else we<br />\nrevoke the Constitution and<br />\nliquidate all dissenters from the<br />\nacceptable line of thought. This<br />\nwould leave us with a statistical<br />\npopulation, one that might exist<br />\nonly on paper, but one that would<br />\nconform to our sense of patriotism. Who is to define these<br />\nlimits of conformity? Are our<br />\nelected representatives to have<br />\nthis power?

(My<br />\nMorris chair, incidentally, was given to me by the Philip Morris<br />\nCompany, makers of Marlboro Cigarettes. They are greathearted folk, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, as millions of<br />\nyou know who have enjoyed their excellent cigarettes.

I was saying that in order to know the true<br />\nfacts about sorority rushing, one must go into the field and<br />\ninvestigate. Consequently, I went last week to the Indiana<br />\nCollege of Spot Welding and Belles Lettres and interviewed<br />\nseveral million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund<br />\nMcKeever. (It is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story<br />\nabout how she came to be named Gerund. It seems that her<br />\nfather, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than anything in the world, and so he named all his children after parts<br />\nof speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named<br />\nPreposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative<br />\nCase. The girls seemed not,to be unduly depressed by their<br />\nnames, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and<br />\nwas finally found one night dangling from a participle. After<br />\nthis tragic event, the father abandoned his practice of grammatical nomenclature,and whatever children were subsequently<br />\nborn to him\u2014eight in all\u2014were named Everett.)<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nUnitas llos Kihrrabit<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\nperate measures.

The question remains,<br />\n\"Should the student body as a<br />\nwhole select from among its own<br />\nto serve on the Honor Commission?\" Judging from the usual<br />\ncourse of popular elections and<br />\nfrom the unique purpose of the<br />\n<br />\nItad a<br />\n<br />\none-mall<br />\nconference<br />\naboutyour<br />\n<br />\nHonor Commission among University organizations, I would reply \"no.\"<br />\nLike it or not, the mechanism<br />\nof popular choice inevitably is<br />\naccompanied by real disadvantages. First, the several candidates must receive some sort of<br />\norganized support; for the Honor<br />\nCommission, in its judicial functions, a membership even slightly in debt to outside forces would<br />\nbe pernicious. Next, the criteria<br />\nfor selection is necesarily altered<br />\nin popular election\u2014generally<br />\naway from more essential qualities for leadership. The members<br />\nof the Commission should know<br />\nintimately<br />\nthe<br />\nrequirements<br />\nneeded for an adroit and useful<br />\nmember, and can examine the<br />\nqualifications of each candidate.<br />\nThe student body could hardly<br />\npossess a similar discernment.<br />\nFinally, constitutional demands<br />\nfor divisions of the membership<br />\namong classes and schools would<br />\nrender popular voting hopelessly cumbersome.<br />\nMr. Knadler did not challenge<br />\n\u2022 the integrity of present Commission members or those of previous years, but rather suggested<br />\nthe possibility of injustice in the<br />\nfuture. That possibility is recognized.

The new manager<br />\nat first finds this fact disconcerning but he will soon learn to<br />\nsmile indulgently at people who<br />\nask him how he manages to run<br />\nall the way across the country<br />\nand make it back in time for<br />\nclass.<br />\nAfter the new manager has<br />\nlearned how to handle the enthusiastic fan, he must next learn<br />\nthe actual mechanics of \"managing\" the team. By and large<br />\nhe will find his most important<br />\n<br />\nlearn how to scrape the mud<br />\noff the gear. In this situation<br />\nexperience has shown that it<br />\nis well to wait until the mud has<br />\ndried. The coach will probably<br />\nalso expect the manager to learn<br />\nto use a stop-watch. This is very<br />\ndifficult; especially if you have<br />\nnever learned to tell time. Above<br />\nall the manager should avoid being locked in the cross-country<br />\nroom by the team. However, if<br />\nNext in importance to learn- this should occur the wisest<br />\ning how to deal with the \"gear\" course is to \"keep smiling.\"<br />\nis learning how to deal with the<br />\n\"coach\". If the \"coach\" is the<br />\nfussy type who insists on such<br />\ntrivialities as sending the laundry out to be washed it will be<br />\nnecessary for the manager to<br />\n<br />\nduty is caring for the team's<br />\n\"gear\". In this connection the<br />\nimmediately<br />\nmanager should<br />\nissue himself a set of sweat<br />\nclothes with the Hopkins cross<br />\ncountry emblem emblazened on<br />\nthe front.

Such was<br />\nthe case at last Sunday's concert sppnsored by the YMCA<br />\nand the Cosmopolitan Club featuring Ravi Shankar and his<br />\namazing sitar. However, I wish<br />\nto caution the reader that this<br />\narticle is not meant as a review<br />\nor a critique. After all, it is impossible to criticize that which<br />\nis imperfectly understood, and<br />\nthis party definitely does not understand Indian Music.<br />\nNonetheless, lack of understanding did not prevent the audience from being wholeheartedly enthusiastic, so obvious was<br />\nMr. Shankar's interpretive genius, and refined virtuosity. Little<br />\nmore can be said about India's<br />\nRenaissance man, because words<br />\nWill never give him his proper<br />\ndue.<br />\n<br />\nNor can much be said about<br />\nthe music he and his company<br />\nplayed, except 'that it was<br />\nstrange, exotic and interesting.<br />\nBut \"interesting\" is not the right<br />\nword; anyone in the Shriver audience would have willingly substituted the word \"fascinating\"<br />\nin contrast to such a compromise<br />\nas \"interesting\". It was fascinating as played by Shankar. Anyone who has the pleasure to be<br />\nintroduced to Indian music by<br />\nsuch an artist can hardly<br />\nignore it.<br />\nAfter a year of applied study<br />\nand constant exposure to the<br />\nsame, perhaps we can venture to<br />\ncriticize Mr. Shankar's performance. Now we can only sit back<br />\nand marvel at the sitarist's<br />\nhauntingly intense style, ably<br />\nsupplemented by his two assistants: Kanai Dutta on the tabla,<br />\nand N. C.

'Fheir avid interest in national and international affairs has gained for those students and universities a wide respect and admiration from their countrymen. The striking difference in attitude toward the<br />\nEuropean student Ps enviously clear to an American<br />\nstudent travelling briefly in Europe. American students,<br />\nby contrast, enjoy little but contempt from informed<br />\nopinion in the United States and abroad. The American<br />\nstudent population, we contend, derives this contempt<br />\nfrom its own apathetic attitude toward issues of real<br />\nimportance.<br />\nIt's sheer nonsense to contend that a university<br />\nstudent council is not competent to give opinions on<br />\nnational and international issues. It's simply an evasion<br />\nof the rather difficult responsibility of keeping one's self<br />\ninformed adequately. It is frightening to think that a<br />\nstudent, living in today's world of dynamic change, could<br />\npossibly abstain from voting on the discrimination issue<br />\non the grounds that he doesn't know enough about racial<br />\nproblems. But that's just what Sophomore representative<br />\nGeorge Elder did.<br />\nThe discrimination issue itself is not of major importance here. What is important is a belated realization<br />\nthat students can and should have opinions and attitudes<br />\nthat deserve recognition by government authorities and<br />\npublic opinion. The Student Council's voice is, admittedly, small and insignificant and the tangible results will<br />\nbe difficult to discern. But, it is a major step in the right<br />\ndirection.<br />\nIronically, the Council's motion, proposed by Fred<br />\nBergerson, vi as apparently more or less a result of<br />\nthe internationally embarassing incidents on U.S. Route<br />\n40 toward New York. However, the racial conditions surrounding the Homewood campus have been quite evident<br />\nto the Council for more than two years now and no<br />\nsimilar action was forthcoming.<br /><br />\nWafer, Wafer Everywh'ere<br />\nAt least once every year the annual cry of a \"cultural<br />\ndesert at Ilopk:us\" echoes through the hallowed halls of<br />\nHomewood.

The Second Johns Hopkins poetry festival<br />\nMill he held. Nine major modern poets will be in attendance, and the program will include both lectures and<br />\nreadings.<br />\nThe facts of the matter are that Hopkins is not a<br />\ntotally deprived campus. Last week Ravi Shankar appeared at Shriver Hall. In the near future Paul Tillich<br />\nwill be sponsored in a lecture by the Levering Hall<br />\nMCA, and Ayn Rand will be sponsored by Challenge.<br />\nThat vague entity known as the UniversitY is .not<br />\nresponsible for any cultural desert here at Homewood.<br />\nDuring the past few years consistent efforts have been<br />\nmade to better the intellectual climate on campus.<br />\nIf anyone is at fault it is the average student. Any<br />\nprogram, especially one as extensive as the Poetry festiv al, can not be a success without complete student support. There will be as much cultural activity on this<br />\ncampus as the Hopkins students deserve. If they support<br />\nthe Poetry Festival, the Foreign Film Festival sponsored<br />\nby the YMCA, the SC Assembly program, arta the other<br />\ntalks and meetings held during the year these activities<br />\nwill expand and grow. If they sit in their rooms and<br />\ncomplain, Hopkins will turn into a desert.<br /><br />\nBy ROBERT ARELLANO<br />\nTwo ambitions I've had in life<br />\nso far, to study at Hopkins and<br />\nto own a car. The first wasn't<br />\nvery difficult, all I had to do was<br />\nto study hard and get Dad to<br />\nfork over the money.<br />\nThe second one was much<br />\nharder, because the old man<br />\nbought his first car with money<br />\nhe earned while he was in school,<br />\nso he thought I should do the<br />\nsame. Builds up character, boosts<br />\nmorale, gives you a feeling of<br />\naccomplishment, and countless<br />\nother rationalizations which Dad<br />\ncan think of. Of course I could<br />\nhave tried to change his mind,<br />\nbut it's easier to reason with<br />\nFidel Castro, so I decided to earn<br />\nthe money.<br />\nMy first job was washing<br />\npipettes and beakers in the<br />\nChemistry department, but I was<br />\nsoon promoted to feeding guinea<br />\npigs, and ended by being one<br />\nmyself\u2014for their allergy tests.<br />\nBy then I also had a job in the<br />\nPsychology department where<br />\nthey needed subjects for their<br />\nmental tests.<br />\nGreen Slips<br />\nAfter a year of this I had<br />\nenough money for a down payment on a brand new car. That<br />\nfirst day, I proudly drove it<br />\naround the Campus and had no<br /><br />\ndifficulty finding a parking space<br />\nalthough some of my friends had<br />\ntold me it was not very easy. By<br />\nfive o'clock when I went to pick<br />\nit up I knew differently. The<br />\ngreen slip on the windshield said<br />\nI was parked in a Faculty lot,<br />\nand that the three dollars were<br />\npayable in Whitehead Hall.<br />\nThe second day I avoided this<br />\nlot and got the green slip for<br />\nparking in an employee lot. The<br />\nthird day was for parking on<br />\nthe grass. There was no slip the<br />\nfourth day, they towed it to<br />\nGreenwood's garage.<br />\nExtra Labor<br />\nThis was proving more expensive than the car payments, so<br />\non the fifth day I started cruising around waiting for someone<br />\nto leave, and sure enough someone did, promptly at eleven. The<br />\nonly problem was that by then<br />\nI had already missed my 9 and<br />\n10 o'clock classes. Obviously<br />\nthis wasn't the answer either,<br />\nfor I couldn't afford to cut two<br />\nclasses a day, so I started arriving at 6:00 A.M.<br />\nBoy, what a difference that<br />\nmade. At least two or three<br />\nchoice spaces were always avails ble\u2022 even at this late hour. But<br />\nthen I started falling asleep in<br />\nall my classes and it wasn't just<br />\nthe early risings but the extra<br /><br />\nwork also.

If one<br />\ngoes to school for eight semesters, one spends the same<br />\namount, be it in four years or<br />\ntwo and two thirds years. However, if one goes to school three<br />\nsemestprs per year, Daddy is<br />\npaying 10' more than he would<br />\nper year otherwise\u2014at least 504<br />\nmore since the student loses his<br />\nopportunity for summer employment. Let us be reasonable; few<br />\nfathers are gold bricks, and fewer enjoy paying what they are<br />\nnow for a year's education.<br />\nI wonder how many proponents of the tri-semester system have looked at the Summer<br />\nSession catalog. If they did, they<br />\nwould notice that Hopkins at<br />\npresent imports teachers from<br />\nother schools to cover'the courses<br />\noffered. Would the research<br />\nwhich Hopkins cultivates suffer<br />\nif a third regular semester were<br />\nadded without substantial additions to the staff? It might.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that Mr.<br />\nScher cannot find the means to<br />\nmake his summer time educationally stimulating, and useful<br />\nto his overall education. If this<br />\nis the case, then perhaps Mr.<br />\nScher does not really have the<br />\nambition and drive to work well<br />\nin any sort of educational<br />\nsystem.<br /><br />\nthe Socialists' policies. Yet if<br />\ntheir ideas are anathema to me,<br />\ntheir right to express them\u2014nonviolently\u2014is a right I must defend.<br />\nI am very much disturbed over<br />\nthe censorship powers wielded by<br />\nMr. Abernathy and Dean Shaffer. Perhaps an off-campus organization such as the YSA does<br />\nindeed need a permit to propagandize on'campus, but this rule<br />\nshould be more widely known,<br />\nand not applied in an apparent<br />\nipso facto manner. Mr. Abernathy allegedly also prevented<br />\nthe Committee for Basic Freedoms from appearing at the<br />\nfreshman activities campaign in<br />\nLevering because its members<br />\nwere too emotional to suit his own<br />\npersonal taste. Certainly we are<br />\nmature enough to use our own<br />\njudgement on political matters.<br />\nIf not, then by inference the<br />\nDemocrats and Republicans\u2014<br />\nwhich seem to have Mr. Aber-<br /><br />\nnathy's approval\u2014must be the<br />\nonly political philosophies immature enough to serve the level<br />\nof thought at Homewood. Where<br />\ndoes censorshop stop?<br />\nTo speak in absolutes, either<br />\nwe extend our democratic philosophy to everyone, or else we<br />\nrevoke the Constitution and<br />\nliquidate all dissenters from the<br />\nacceptable line of thought. This<br />\nwould leave us with a statistical<br />\npopulation, one that might exist<br />\nonly on paper, but one that would<br />\nconform to our sense of patriotism. Who is to define these<br />\nlimits of conformity? Are our<br />\nelected representatives to have<br />\nthis power? It does not seem fair<br />\nthat they use their own judgement as the sole determination<br />\nof who is to be granted tolerance and who is not.<br />\n.

Consequently, I went last week to the Indiana<br />\nCollege of Spot Welding and Belles Lettres and interviewed<br />\nseveral million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund<br />\nMcKeever. (It is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story<br />\nabout how she came to be named Gerund. It seems that her<br />\nfather, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than anything in the world, and so he named all his children after parts<br />\nof speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named<br />\nPreposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative<br />\nCase. The girls seemed not,to be unduly depressed by their<br />\nnames, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and<br />\nwas finally found one night dangling from a participle. After<br />\nthis tragic event, the father abandoned his practice of grammatical nomenclature,and whatever children were subsequently<br />\nborn to him\u2014eight in all\u2014were named Everett.)<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nUnitas llos Kihrrabit<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\nperate measures.

You swing around<br />\ncurves flat as you please, in complete control. You whip through the sticky spots other cars<br />\nshould keep out of in the first place. (Especially this year, now that you can get Positraction<br />\nas an extra-cost option.) You stop smoothly, levelly with Corvair's beautifully balanced,<br />\nbigger brakes.<br />\nAnd Corvair's found other new ways to please you this year. A forced-air heater and<br />\ndefroster are standard equipment on all coupes, sedans and both Monza and 700 Station<br />\nWagons. So are dual sunshades and front-door armrests and some other goodies. You'll note<br />\nsome new styling, inside and out. Nice. And safety-belt installation is easier, too, and cheaper.<br />\nAnother extra-cost option well worth considering is the heavy-duty front and rear suspension;<br />\nIt turns a Corvair into a real tiger.<br />\nSo you can see we haven't really done much to Corvair this year.

First, the several candidates must receive some sort of<br />\norganized support; for the Honor<br />\nCommission, in its judicial functions, a membership even slightly in debt to outside forces would<br />\nbe pernicious.

The new manager<br />\nat first finds this fact disconcerning but he will soon learn to<br />\nsmile indulgently at people who<br />\nask him how he manages to run<br />\nall the way across the country<br />\nand make it back in time for<br />\nclass.<br />\nAfter the new manager has<br />\nlearned how to handle the enthusiastic fan, he must next learn<br />\nthe actual mechanics of \"managing\" the team. By and large<br />\nhe will find his most important<br /><br />\nlearn how to scrape the mud<br />\noff the gear. In this situation<br />\nexperience has shown that it<br />\nis well to wait until the mud has<br />\ndried. The coach will probably<br />\nalso expect the manager to learn<br />\nto use a stop-watch. This is very<br />\ndifficult; especially if you have<br />\nnever learned to tell time. Above<br />\nall the manager should avoid being locked in the cross-country<br />\nroom by the team. However, if<br />\nNext in importance to learn- this should occur the wisest<br />\ning how to deal with the \"gear\" course is to \"keep smiling.\"<br />\nis learning how to deal with the<br />\n\"coach\".

Such was<br />\nthe case at last Sunday's concert sppnsored by the YMCA<br />\nand the Cosmopolitan Club featuring Ravi Shankar and his<br />\namazing sitar. However, I wish<br />\nto caution the reader that this<br />\narticle is not meant as a review<br />\nor a critique. After all, it is impossible to criticize that which<br />\nis imperfectly understood, and<br />\nthis party definitely does not understand Indian Music.<br />\nNonetheless, lack of understanding did not prevent the audience from being wholeheartedly enthusiastic, so obvious was<br />\nMr. Shankar's interpretive genius, and refined virtuosity. Little<br />\nmore can be said about India's<br />\nRenaissance man, because words<br />\nWill never give him his proper<br />\ndue.<br /><br />\nNor can much be said about<br />\nthe music he and his company<br />\nplayed, except 'that it was<br />\nstrange, exotic and interesting.<br />\nBut \"interesting\" is not the right<br />\nword; anyone in the Shriver audience would have willingly substituted the word \"fascinating\"<br />\nin contrast to such a compromise<br />\nas \"interesting\". It was fascinating as played by Shankar. Anyone who has the pleasure to be<br />\nintroduced to Indian music by<br />\nsuch an artist can hardly<br />\nignore it.<br />\nAfter a year of applied study<br />\nand constant exposure to the<br />\nsame, perhaps we can venture to<br />\ncriticize Mr. Shankar's performance. Now we can only sit back<br />\nand marvel at the sitarist's<br />\nhauntingly intense style, ably<br />\nsupplemented by his two assistants: Kanai Dutta on the tabla,<br />\nand N. C.
