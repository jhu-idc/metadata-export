This one is more<br />\nnearly related in character to that of Europe and<br />\nNorth Asia (Palwarctic) than any other, though it<br />\npossesses an admixture of South American (Neotrop-<br />\nical) life. The most remote from it in character is<br />\nthe Australian fauna, then the Palwotropical (Indian),<br />\nand the African is a little nearer.

In the broad sense, the<br />\nlife of the district is characterized by the presence<br />\nof some ancient forms of life, which have passed<br />\naway in prior geologic epochs, though the Neotrop-<br />\nical and Australian fauna possess a still larger portion<br />\nof such. Thus, the snapping-tortoise and the Profo-<br />\nnopsis have fossil representatives in some strata of<br />\nEurope, and the extinct relatives of the bony gar<br />\nabound in still older rocks.<br />\n<br />\nAnother proportion of types may be considered<br />\nNeotropical (South American) in character. Such are<br />\namong Mammals, the opossum and the wood-mice<br />\n(Hesperomys); among Birds, the Tyrannide (king-<br />\nbird, pewees, etc.), the humming-birds (Zrochilus),<br />\nand the tanagers (Pyranga); among the Fishes, the<br />\nNematognathi may be mentioned.  Of especial North<br />\nAmerican character may be enumerated the raccoon<br />\n(Procyon), the skunks (Mephitis), and the lesser deer<br />\n(Cariacus); also the American porcupine (Lirethizon).<br />\nAmong birds, the turkey and the wood-warblers<br />\n(Dendreeca) belong especially to the Nearctic fuuna.<br />\nAmong reptiles, the rattlesnakes and copperheads,<br />\nthe whole of the salamanders except two species, and<br />\nespecially the Protonopsis and Necturus, are especially<br />\nNorth American.  Of this character, among the<br />\n<br />\n. fishes, are the gar, dog-fish, pike, and Etheostomine<br />\n<br />\nperch, an extensive group of small fishes without<br />\nswim-bladders, found in all streams.<br />\n<br />\nThere are certain climatal divisions of the fauna<br />\nof the Eastern district of North America, regulated<br />\nby the elevation of the surface, the latitude, temper-<br />\nature, ete.

These have been named the Floridian,<br />\nthe Louisianian, the Carolinian, the Alleghanion, the<br />\nCanadian, the Hudsonian, ete. Maryland is traversed<br />\nby the Carolinian, the Alleghanian, and the Cana-<br />\ndian, and their boundaries separate the breeding-<br />\nplaces of various species of birds, and range of others,<br />\nof mammals, ete.<br /><br />\nThe greater part of the area of the State, that s,<br />\nthe low countries from the ocean to the Potomac and<br />\nto the line extending from Wilmington to Baltimoroe<br />\nand to Washington, D.
