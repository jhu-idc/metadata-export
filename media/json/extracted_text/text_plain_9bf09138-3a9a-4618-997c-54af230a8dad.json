The fair was designed to<br />\nprovide undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate students with the opportunity to speak with<br />\nrepresentatives from various<br />\nfields.<br />\nThe professionals who participated in the fair were alumni who had expressed an interest in helping provide<br />\nguidance to students making<br />\ncareer choices.

Because science is<br />\nviewed as a self-correcting<br />\nsystem, anyone who would<br />\nknowingly cheat would be a<br />\nmadman, because he is bound<br />\nto get caught sooner or later.<br />\nIncidences of cheating in<br />\nscience are viewed by the scientific community as \"a problem<br />\nof individual psychopathology,<br />\nand as such, do not really<br />\nreflect on science itself\" The<br />\ntruth of the matter, Wade<br />\nargued, is a far different story.<br />\n\"Science doesn't work in<br />\nanything like the way scientists<br />\nare taught to think it works,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nTo understand how science<br />\ncan be deceived, Wade claimed<br />\nthat one must first understand<br />\nhow scientific research results<br />\nbecome science. The circulati9n<br />\nto the scientific community of<br />\n<br />\nsignificant research results is<br />\nachieved primarily in scientific<br />\njournals; consequently, it is in<br />\nthe publication process that the<br />\nchecking mechanisms of science<br />\nexist.<br />\nWhenever an article is submitted to a journal, it is circulated among a panel of<br />\nreferees who judge the experimental methods and results<br />\nto determine whether or not the<br />\narticle should be published. A<br />\nsecond checking mechanism of<br />\nscience is the process of peer<br />\nreview which occurs during<br />\nresearch grant applications to<br />\ninsure the just distribution of<br />\nfunds.<br />\nThe last, and theoretically<br />\nstrictest, test of a research<br />\nreport is replication of the<br />\nstudy. Reproducability of study<br />\nresults lies at the foundation of<br />\nthe scientific method, through<br />\nwhich it is assumed science is<br />\npracticed.<br />\nIn practice, however, the<br />\nchecking mechanisms of science<br />\ndo not always work. In all the<br />\ncases of scientific fraud which<br />\nWade and Broad uncover in<br />\ntheir book, none were uncovered by science's alleged<br />\nprocess of self-correction. The<br />\nbuilt-in quality control which<br />\nscience is supposed to have is<br />\none of the basic reasons why<br />\nscientists are treated as experts<br />\nby the general public: we feel<br />\nthey cannot lie, for their<br />\ndiscipline itself won't allow<br />\nthem to lie.<br />\nMost of the cases of fraud in<br />\nscience which Wade studied<br />\narose because science is both a<br />\ndiscipline and a career. Under<br />\npressure for research positions,<br />\nrefunding, professional advancement, and prestige, it<br />\noften becomes necessary for a<br />\n<br />\nscientist to produce results<br />\nwhich he does not really have,<br />\nor to report experiments which<br />\nhe has neither finished nor even<br />\nstarted. Although one would<br />\nlike to trust the processes of<br />\nreview mentioned above,<br />\nhistory shows them as fallible.<br />\nFor example, in the case of<br />\nmicrobiologist John Long,<br />\n\"there was a failure of all three<br />\nmechanisms to detect gross<br />\nfraud.\" Long worked at the<br />\nprestigious Massachusetts<br />\nGeneral Hospital as a cancer<br />\nresearcher<br />\ninvestigating<br />\nHodgkins disease. He succeeded where all other researchers<br />\nhad failed; he established<br />\nseveral cell lines of Hodgkins<br />\ndisease in the test tube, where<br />\nthey usually die after a short<br />\nperiod. The cells led Long to a<br />\nlong and respected research<br />\ncareer, during which his results<br />\nwere frequently published, including the Proceedings of the<br />\nNational Academy ofSciences.<br />\nHe was also awarded $759,000<br />\nfrom the National Institutes of<br />\nHealth to continue this<br />\nresearch.<br />\nLong became so productive<br />\nthat it led to his downfall. A<br />\njunior researcher was astonished at how fast Long completed<br />\nan experiment. After researching the matter, he proved<br />\nthat the experiment could not<br />\nhave taken place. \"It was later<br />\ndiscovered,\" said Wade,\"that<br />\nLong's cells were not even those<br />\nof a human. They were found<br />\nto belong to a northern Colombian brown-footed owl<br />\nmonkey.\" The chromosonial<br />\npatterns of the cells, clearly not<br />\nthose of a human being, occupied a half page in the Proceedings of the National<br />\nAcademy of Sciences. \"The<br />\n<br />\nmonkey cells,\" said Wade,<br />\n\"made monkeys out of just<br />\nabout everyone.\"<br />\nIn Long's case, the failure to<br />\ndetect such wrong-doing arose<br />\nfrom the respect for his position<br />\nas a distinguished researcher.<br />\nFurthermore, because science<br />\nand recognition in science are<br />\nbased on originality, no one<br />\nwould try to replicate results<br />\nwhich already appeared<br />\nestablished. Researchers' use of<br />\nraw data is also assumed to be<br />\nsacrosanct. \"Merely asking to<br />\nlook at raw data is tantamount<br />\nto an accusation.\"<br />\nTo illustrate this, Wade<br />\nrelated the experiment of<br />\npsychologist Robert Rawlins.<br />\nRawlins wrote to professors<br />\nwho had their experimental<br />\nresults published. In what is<br />\nprimarily the only way of verifying the truth of an experiment, researchers appeared to<br />\nbe quite inept. \"More than half<br />\nof the professors reported their<br />\ndata lost or destroyed. Of the<br />\nseven returned, three contained<br />\ngross errors.\"<br />\nBecause there are no clearcut rules for the attribution of<br />\ncredit in journal articles, many<br />\nprofessors can claim work that<br />\nis not really their own. The entire lab-chief-graduate student<br />\nrelationship is capable of being<br />\nexploited.<br />\nThe most shocking example<br />\nof this actually came to decide<br />\nthe 1974 Nobel Prize for<br />\nPhysics. Jocelyn Bell, a<br />\ngraduate student in astronomy<br />\nat Cambridge, was operating a<br />\nradio-dish antenna which she<br />\nhad built in her spare time.<br />\nWhile working on something<br />\nnot related to her project for<br />\nher advisor, she detected an extremely regular pulse of radio<br />\n<br />\nwaves. After notifying the<br />\ndirectors of the lab, \"the<br />\nBritish Parliament was informed that Cambridge was in contact with an extraterrestrial<br />\ncivilization.\"<br />\nAfter Bell detected a similar<br />\nradio source, the theory was<br />\nthrown out. What Bell actually discovered were pulsars. In<br />\n1974, the discovery was rewarded with the Nobel Prize.<br />\nHowever, because the published results appeared with Anthony Hewish, her lab-chief, as<br />\nfirst author, the prize committee decided to award him the<br />\nprize.<br />\nAnother enormously important factor in getting scientific<br />\nwork published is the rhetorical<br />\neffectiveness of the research<br />\nreport. Because results which<br />\nare either too far from or too<br />\nclose to ideal results are difficult to publish, it becomes<br />\ntempting to \"doctor\" research<br />\nresults.<br />\nWade ended his presentation<br />\nwith an explanation of how to<br />\ncheat in science and not get<br />\ncaught:<br />\n(1)Publish many plausible findings, but none so original as to<br />\nstir controversy;(2)list as many<br />\ncolleagues as possible as coauthors;(3) destroy all of your<br />\noriginal research data as soon<br />\nas you invent them; (4) praise<br />\npeer review members and journal reviewers and cite their<br />\nwork prominently in all you put<br />\nbefore them;(5) use your grant<br />\nmoney to get bright young grad<br />\nstudents and then co-author all<br />\nof their work; (6) cultivate<br />\nfriendships with anyone with a<br />\nSwedish name. \"If you follow<br />\nall of these steps, who knows,<br />\nyou just might win the Nobel<br />\nPrize.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f8/APRIL 19, 1985<br />\n<br />\njippkin5<br />\n<br />\nI would recommend that Tyrus<br />\nfootnote and give credit to<br />\nPravda, after all, it is illegal to<br />\nparaphrase somebody without<br />\ngiving them credit.<br />\nLloyd Melnick<br />\n<br />\nReview Defense<br />\n<br />\n1/e1130-tetter<br />\nA Touch of the Tropics<br />\n\"Every Spring, the entire University<br />\nplunges into a three day celebration of arts,<br />\ncrafts, music, and food.

Planned and run entirely by<br />\nstudents, the Spring Fair is the highlight of<br />\nthe social year and attracts Baltimoreans<br />\nfrom every corner of the city.\"<br />\nSo says a recent prospectus about the annual Hopkins weekend devoted to fun,<br />\nrevelry, and just a little bit of craziness. \"A<br />\nTouch of the Tropics\", which officially<br />\nbegins today at noon, promises to liye up to<br />\nthese expectations and more. A greater<br />\nnumber of students became involved in the<br />\nplanning of the extravaganza this year and<br />\nseveral new activities, such as Fair Games,<br />\nhave been introduced to the agenda.<br />\nIn other words, Hopkins students should<br />\nnot only be prepared to tolerate this<br />\nmadness, bEtt also to enjoy and take advantage of this peculiar exception to the school's<br />\ngenerally non-existent social life.

Tyrus<br />\nimplied, in none too eloquent<br />\nterms, that I was racist, which<br />\nis totally unfounded. First of<br />\nall, a brief look at my personal<br />\nhistory will convince even the<br />\nmost wary skeptic (Tyrus included)that I am far from prejudiced; as a matter of fact I am<br />\non the other side of the spectrum. Also, analysis like Tyrus<br />\nmade of the entire Goetz situation is what makes it a racial attitude, not what really happened. If the four hoodlums were<br />\nblack, white, hispanic, or even<br />\npre-med, I still would have used Goetz's likeness and my<br />\nslogan on my posters. It did not<br />\nmatter to me that Mr. Goetz<br />\nwas white and the hoodlums<br />\nwere black, what mattered was<br />\nthat Mr. Goetz was standing up<br />\nfor his right to ride the subway<br />\nunmolested, and I wanted to<br />\nshow I would stand up for the<br />\nstudent's rights.<br />\nThis is the time when people<br />\nlike Tyrus spit out garbage like<br />\n\"but those four poor,<br />\nunemployed, unarmed, nice<br />\n<br />\nboys only asked for five dollars way he blamed the \"problems<br />\nso they could play video of unemployment and poverty\"<br />\ngames.\" Anyone who lives in for the way the hoodlums<br />\nthe real world knows what kind acted.

Two<br />\nstars.\" but I find them appallingly boring, as do many<br />\nothers.<br />\nJohn E. Burke<br />\n<br />\nStudent Apathy<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to discuss an<br />\nissue which has concerned me<br />\nsince my arrival at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University this<br />\nSeptember. The issue is \"student apathy.\" I hesitate to use<br />\nthe term \"student apathy,\" as<br />\nit has become somewhat colloquial here and lost some of its<br />\nimpact. Perhaps I should refer<br />\nto this phenomenon as \"mass<br />\ndisinterest,\" \"isolationism,\" or<br />\neven \"anti-socialism.\" In any<br />\ncase, it's frightening that<br />\n<br />\nstudents attending such a small<br />\nschool as this can be so indifferent to the events surrounding<br />\nthem.<br />\nI frequently hear students lament that Hopkins is devoid of<br />\nsocial life. People claim that<br />\nthere is simply nothing to do<br />\nhere. I think this is an utterly<br />\nridiculous attitude. As a<br />\nmember of many campus<br />\ngroups, I find my time very well<br />\noccupied by non-academic activities. Groups like the Dorm<br />\nCouncil Social Programming<br />\nCommittee and the Office of<br />\nResidential Life sponsor<br />\nnumerous activities. It takes<br />\ntwo things to make a social life:<br />\na medium and motivation. It is<br />\nnot the medium which is lacking here, but rather the participation on the part of the<br />\nstudents. A line from the<br />\n1984-85 Circular illustrates this<br />\npoint: \"Entertainment, concerts, plays, lectures, other<br />\ncultural events, and student activities are always available at<br />\nJohns Hopkins; it is up to you<br />\nto decide if you want to participate.\" If you decide that<br />\nyou will not participate, then<br />\nyou lose the right to complain<br />\nabout a meagre social life.<br />\nThere is no such thing as a prepackaged social life.

As I watched, I wondered why only<br />\nabout thirty people were protesting. This campus has over<br />\ntwo thousand undergraduates.<br />\nIs only one percent of the<br />\npopulation here concerned<br />\nabout the injustice of apartheid? Do supporters of antiapartheid legislation have to<br />\nresort to soliciting student<br />\nsignatures in the Terrace<br />\nRoom? Apparently so.<br />\nParticularly disheartening are<br />\nthe results of the recent class<br />\ncouncil elections. In each class,<br />\nunder forty-one percent of the<br />\neligible students voted. The<br />\nselection of class officers strikes<br />\nme as one of the issues which<br />\naffects the students most directly. Why is the voter turnout so<br />\npoor? We are content to complain about the negligible accomplishments of our class officers, but we are unwilling to<br />\nshow up at the polls to elect<br />\nmore competent people. Not<br />\nonly are the majority of<br />\nstudents unwilling to take part<br />\nin class elections, but there also,<br />\nappears to be a lack of interest<br />\non the part of potential candidates. Of the fifteen offices<br />\navailable in the three classes,<br />\n<br />\nfive candidates ran unopposed.<br />\nThese figures are disgraceful.<br />\nThe whole point of the voting<br />\nsystem is defeated.<br />\nWhat has happened here is<br />\nthat students are no longer<br />\nmotivated to participate in<br />\ncampus events. In times past,<br />\nstudents were motivated by a<br />\ndesire to learn, a desire to succeed, and a desire to develop<br />\nmore fully as individuals. These<br />\ndesires seem to have vanished<br />\ncompletely. What motivates<br />\nstudents nowadays? I fear that<br />\nit is pursuit of grades, fulfillment of degree requirements,<br />\nand enhancement of resumes. I<br />\nwould hate to think that we are<br />\ncultivating a race of individuals<br />\nwho are motivated by nothing<br />\nother than greed and selfinterest, or worse, by nothing at<br />\nall.<br />\nThere is no excuse for<br />\napathy. The amount of effort<br />\nit takes to become involved is<br />\njustified by the rewards. The<br />\ntime has come for us to take a<br />\ngood look at ourselves. If we<br />\ncontinue on the course of nonparticipation, our sheltered<br />\nwill<br />\ngradually<br />\nsociety<br />\ndeteriorate and eventually cease<br />\nto function.

Because the officers<br />\nof my class neglected to show<br />\nup at the meeting at which the<br />\nSAC budgets were assigned.<br />\nMy question is this: How can<br />\n<br />\nwe elect to public office people students place in them?<br />\nwho can't be bothered to fulfill<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nthe minimal responsibilities of<br />\nMike Kupritz<br />\ntheir offices? I am outraged,<br />\nClass of 1988<br />\noffended, and embarrassed by<br />\nthe blatant disregard for<br />\nresponsibilities which my class<br />\nofficers have shown.

M.<br />\nDouglas Jones, M.D., the<br />\nClinical Director of the<br />\nNeonatal Intensive Care Unit<br />\n(NICU) at Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, recently spoke at the<br />\nSchool of Continuing Studies<br />\nof the NICU.<br />\nThe ventilator that is used today in neonatal nurseries is a<br />\nstraightforward device much<br />\nsimpler than those which<br />\npreceded it. Oxygen gas flows<br />\nin one side of a tube that has a<br />\nbranch, which is called an en-<br />\n<br />\ndotracheal tube, that goes into<br />\nthe baby's lungs. The baby can<br />\nactually breath in and out at<br />\nwill from this moving stream of<br />\nair. At the end of the stream is<br />\na valve that can be controlled in<br />\nseveral ways according to time.<br />\nThere is an electrical timer that<br />\ncloses the valve at designated<br />\nintervals. The air pressure controlled by the valve builds up in<br />\nthe tube to a predetermined<br />\namount, forcing air into the<br />\nbaby's lungs. Resistance to this<br />\npressure indicates diseased<br />\ntissue. The more lung disease<br />\nthe baby has, the less volume<br />\nthat will enter for any given<br />\npressure. Lungs can consequently become thick and<br />\nswollen.<br />\nThe design of this ventilator<br />\nkeeps a \"constant positive airway pressure\" at all times,<br />\nwhich stabilizes the baby's<br />\nlungs so they won't collapse<br />\ncompletely between breaths.<br />\n<br />\nThe main advantage to this ventilator is that when the baby<br />\nstarts to improve, it can do a lot<br />\nof breathing on its own, thus<br />\ndecreasing<br />\nsignificantly<br />\nneonatal mortality. The timer is<br />\noriginally set at 150 breaths per<br />\nminute. As the baby improves,<br />\nthis rate is gradually lowered<br />\nuntil the infant can breath by<br />\nitself. With the old ventilator<br />\ndesigns, babies were either on'<br />\nor off the ventilator, since most<br />\nbabies couldn't tolerate this<br />\ndrastic change, the mortality<br />\nrates were high. The ability to<br />\nwean the baby off the ventilator<br />\nin the last 10-15 years is responsible for the doubling of the<br />\nsurvival rate for babies suffering from respiratory distress<br />\nsyndrome, which is due to<br />\npremature lungs.<br />\nA routine procedure as simple as taking a blood pressure<br />\ncannot be done the same way in<br />\ninfants as in adults.

A machine called a<br />\nDoppler Device was recently<br />\ndeveloped. This machine,<br />\nwhich costs $400, is cheap in<br />\nterms of medical care. It works<br />\non the same principle as that of<br />\na sound heard from a train<br />\npassing by. As the train travels,<br />\nthe diesel horn emits a highpitched sound as it approaches<br />\nand a low-pitched sound as it<br />\ndeparts. When sound waves see<br />\nsomething that is moving, they<br />\nbounce back at a rate that is<br />\ndetermined by that body's<br />\nspeed and direction.<br />\nThe instrument, which consists of a small crystal that<br />\nsends out signal at various frequencies, can detect movements<br />\nof the red blood cells in the<br />\nvessels. It emits a sound that<br />\n<br />\ncan be heard each time blood<br />\npulses through the vessel. This<br />\ndevice is very accurate when<br />\ncompared to pressures detected<br />\ndirectly with an umbilical artery<br />\ncathez.r.

A number of<br />\natoms in the body have<br />\nmagnetic properties so that<br />\nwhen placed in a magnetic<br />\nfield, the atoms will all line up<br />\nin a certain way.

In August<br />\n1984, Seliger and his colleagues predicted severe mortality among oysters and other<br />\nspecies, based on a model incorporating these climatic factors. Independent surveys in<br />\nSeptember 1984 confirmed the<br />\nprediction, although a precipitous drop in temperature<br />\nlimited the damage, saving the<br />\nremaining oyster seed beds.<br />\nAccording to Seliger, the<br />\nmodel means that scientists<br />\ncan now correlate climatic<br />\nevents with water circulation<br />\n<br />\nand oyster populations in the<br />\nBay.

Go to the lower quad<br />\nand indulge in a little Elvis or<br />\nmaybe a technicolor landscape.<br />\nOther good bets are wood-andstraw plaques, bread dough art,<br />\nor self-portraits. The wealth of<br />\ntalent displayed by unpretentious artists on the brink of<br />\nfame puts the Baltimore<br />\nmuseum of Art's collection to<br />\nshame.

It<br />\nis here in New Jersey that the<br />\ncat wanders into its second<br />\nstory. Actually, this is not so<br />\nmuch a story as it is an idea: a<br />\nguy crawls around the ledge of<br />\na skyscraper. That's it. Oh,<br />\nthere's a smattering of<br />\ncharacterization, as well as a little bit of set-up thrown in for<br />\ngood measure; for the most<br />\npart, though, such elements are<br />\nnonexistent here.<br />\nRobert Hays(Airplane) is the<br />\nledge walker, doing so as part<br />\nof a wager where the stakes are<br />\nwhether or not he can have his<br />\ngirlfriend (the wife of the man<br />\nwho makes Hays the offer he<br />\ncan't refuse) and whether or<br />\nnot he wIl be set up with heroin<br />\nfor the police. Hays's tour of<br />\nthe ledge takes up an inordinate<br />\namount of the story, and by the<br />\ntime the conclusion arrives, the<br />\nviewer has had ample time to<br />\ncalculate what the surprise of<br />\nthe surprise ending will be. The<br />\nstory is so short on plot that the<br />\n<br />\nonly surprise at all lies in the<br />\nfact that King and Teague<br />\nchose to put it on celluloid instead of a more worthy story,<br />\nwhere the ledge walking could<br />\nbe the climax.<br />\nAt long last, the cat arrives at<br />\nits Wilmington, North Carolina<br />\ndestination to help Ms. Barrymore combat the evil troll<br />\nwhich resides in her bedroom<br />\nwall. This six-inch tall<br />\nGremlins-inspired creature<br />\n(created by Carlo Rambaldi)<br />\nrears its ugly little head at night,<br />\ncausing Barrymore to have<br />\nnightmares as the creature attempts to steal her breath. The<br />\ncat, who is being called<br />\n\"General\" by Drew, knows his<br />\nresponsibility and sets out to<br />\ndestroy this dagger-wielding<br />\nmonster in the court jester's<br />\ncap. Unfortunately, complications occur in the form of a cathating mother who tries to have<br />\nGeneral put to sleep.<br />\nThis episode may rank above<br />\nthe others in terms of clever<br />\nspecial effects, but it is<br />\nsomewhere between the other<br />\n<br />\ntwo in terms of a quality<br />\nstoryline. Surprisingly, none of<br />\nthe three stories really contains<br />\nthe horror with which the<br />\nauthor's name has become<br />\nsynonymous. Rather, it seems<br />\nas if Mr. King was more inspired by 0. Henry than his<br />\nown past works. Granted, the<br />\nstories may be a touch more<br />\ngruesome than those Henry<br />\nmight have committed to<br />\npaper, but those endings with<br />\nthe surprise twists are everpresent in the Cat's Eye tales.<br />\nNone of Cat's Eye can be<br />\ncalled truly bad. The second<br />\nepisode may be plotless, but it<br />\ndoes what it does well. Similarly, the third episode's lackluster<br />\nstory is complemented by a host<br />\nof interesting and entertaining<br />\nspecial effects. But it is only the<br />\nfirst episode which can merit<br />\nanything more than a halfhearted recommendation. Since<br />\nonly a third of Cat's Eye is worthy of full praise, perhaps you<br />\ncan convince the local theater to<br />\nadmit you for only a third of<br />\nthe full price.<br />\n<br />\n\fWJHU: The Real Spirit of Rock and<br />\nContinued from Page 22<br />\n\"ALL-THRASH nights\"; occasionally will have \"ALLPOP<br />\nUsually<br />\nnights.\"<br />\nsomewhere in between.<br />\nFavorite albums: Husker Du:<br />\nZen Arcade, Minutemen: Double Nickels on the Dime, Lyres:<br />\nOn Fyre.<br />\nWednesday Morning 1-3<br />\na.m.<br />\n<br />\nSteve Palmieri<br />\n\"Dark Parades\"<br />\nCurrent<br />\nDescription:<br />\nEnglish, German, and Japanese<br />\nmusic.

The Johns<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team benefitted from a change of midfield<br />\nlines, playing fields, and opponents, however, as the Jays<br />\nrebounded from an April 6 loss<br />\nto North Carolina to down the<br />\nBlack Knights of Army, 12-8,<br />\nSaturday on Homewood Field.<br />\nWith the victory, the Blue<br />\nJays have reclaimed the number<br />\none position in this week's<br />\nUSILA coaches' poll; Syracuse<br />\nnow holds the number two<br />\nspot.<br />\nFreshman attackman Mike<br />\nMorrill also rebounded after<br />\nbeing shut out against the Tar<br />\nHeels to post his second fourgoal performance of the year in<br />\nleading the Blue Jays to victory.<br />\nSophomore attackman Brian<br />\nWood had two goals and junior<br />\nmidfielders Del Dressel and<br />\nSteve Mutscheller each added<br />\ntwo goals and two assists.<br />\nZim forced to juggle<br />\n<br />\nHead coach Don Zimmerman was forced to juggle midfield lines when junior Chris<br />\nSchreiber fractured bones in his<br />\nhand during a weekly practice.<br />\nThe second-line middie is expected to miss at least 3-4 weeks<br />\nof action.<br />\nAs a result, Zimmerman<br />\nteamed Mutscheller and Del<br />\nDressel on the first line and<br />\nstarted freshman John Dressel<br />\nfor the first time. Moving to the<br />\nsecond line were senior tricaptain John Krumenacker and<br />\nsophomore Bruce Chanenchuk.<br />\nAt the third position, Zimmerman alternated freshman Joe<br />\nRzempoluch and senior Glenn<br />\n<br />\nFidje.<br />\n\"I wanted to shake things up<br />\na lot,\" said the coach afterwards. \"I was very pleased with<br />\nJohn Dressel's performance\u2014<br />\nit's hard for a freshman to do<br />\nwell against Army. Joe Rzempoluch also played very well.\"<br />\nFrom the outset of the game<br />\nit was obvious that the Blue<br />\nJays had learned from their<br />\nmistakes the week before.<br />\nThough they lost the opening<br />\nfaceoff, the Jays quickly gained possession on a Black Knight<br />\nturnover. They then settled<br />\ndown into a deliberate offense,<br />\n<br />\ntrying to crack Army's tough<br />\nzone defense. \"You've got to<br />\nbe patient against the zone,\"<br />\nremarked Zimmerman.\"We've<br />\nworked for the good shots.\"<br />\nEven so, the Blue Jays could<br />\nnot dent the net, as Army goalie<br />\nRob Koehler made some good<br />\nsaves. The Black Knights were<br />\neven less fortunate against the<br />\nJay defense, however, and the<br />\ngame remained scoreless<br />\nhalfway through the period.<br />\nAn offensive capitalization<br />\n<br />\nIt was at this point that the<br />\nJays were finally able to<br />\ncapitalize on Army's aggressive<br />\nstyle of play. Breaking off a<br />\ntough four-man ride, Del<br />\nDressel raced all the way upfield, and just as the defense<br />\nmade its adjustment, he found<br />\nMorrill cutting in front of the<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshait<br />\n<br />\nJunior Steve Mutscheller<br />\n<br />\ncrease. Hopkins was on top to<br />\nstay.<br />\nThe Blue Jays kept up the<br />\npressure as they dominated on<br />\nthe ground balls, and the offense controlled the tempo of<br />\nthe game. \"Last week the ball<br />\nbounced their [Carolina's]<br />\nway,\" explained Mutscheller.<br />\n\"We didn't want to get beat<br />\nagain on the ground balls.\"<br />\nEven a missed one-on-one<br />\nopportunity by junior attackman Geoff Nordberg did<br />\nnot slow the Jay attack.<br />\nAgain it was a fast break<br />\nwhich led to a Hopkins tally.<br />\nThis time, however, it was the<br />\n<br />\nwas<br />\n<br />\nmoved to the first midfield line last week.<br />\n<br />\naggressive, double-teaming style as Morrill tallied once<br />\ndefense of Mutscheller and again and Del Dressel and<br />\nDressel which gave them the Mutscheller teamed up on a<br />\nopportunity.

The fair was designed to<br />\nprovide undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate students with the opportunity to speak with<br />\nrepresentatives from various<br />\nfields.<br />\nThe professionals who participated in the fair were alumni who had expressed an interest in helping provide<br />\nguidance to students making<br />\ncareer choices. Also present<br />\nwere representatives from<br />\nvarious university divisions, including SAIS, pre-law and premedical advising, the Metro<br />\nCenter, the Placement Bureau,<br />\nand the Internships Advising<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nAmong the alumni present<br />\nwere Dr. Alexander M.

Because science is<br />\nviewed as a self-correcting<br />\nsystem, anyone who would<br />\nknowingly cheat would be a<br />\nmadman, because he is bound<br />\nto get caught sooner or later.<br />\nIncidences of cheating in<br />\nscience are viewed by the scientific community as \"a problem<br />\nof individual psychopathology,<br />\nand as such, do not really<br />\nreflect on science itself\" The<br />\ntruth of the matter, Wade<br />\nargued, is a far different story.<br />\n\"Science doesn't work in<br />\nanything like the way scientists<br />\nare taught to think it works,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nTo understand how science<br />\ncan be deceived, Wade claimed<br />\nthat one must first understand<br />\nhow scientific research results<br />\nbecome science. The circulati9n<br />\nto the scientific community of<br /><br />\nsignificant research results is<br />\nachieved primarily in scientific<br />\njournals; consequently, it is in<br />\nthe publication process that the<br />\nchecking mechanisms of science<br />\nexist.<br />\nWhenever an article is submitted to a journal, it is circulated among a panel of<br />\nreferees who judge the experimental methods and results<br />\nto determine whether or not the<br />\narticle should be published. A<br />\nsecond checking mechanism of<br />\nscience is the process of peer<br />\nreview which occurs during<br />\nresearch grant applications to<br />\ninsure the just distribution of<br />\nfunds.<br />\nThe last, and theoretically<br />\nstrictest, test of a research<br />\nreport is replication of the<br />\nstudy. Reproducability of study<br />\nresults lies at the foundation of<br />\nthe scientific method, through<br />\nwhich it is assumed science is<br />\npracticed.<br />\nIn practice, however, the<br />\nchecking mechanisms of science<br />\ndo not always work. In all the<br />\ncases of scientific fraud which<br />\nWade and Broad uncover in<br />\ntheir book, none were uncovered by science's alleged<br />\nprocess of self-correction. The<br />\nbuilt-in quality control which<br />\nscience is supposed to have is<br />\none of the basic reasons why<br />\nscientists are treated as experts<br />\nby the general public: we feel<br />\nthey cannot lie, for their<br />\ndiscipline itself won't allow<br />\nthem to lie.<br />\nMost of the cases of fraud in<br />\nscience which Wade studied<br />\narose because science is both a<br />\ndiscipline and a career. Under<br />\npressure for research positions,<br />\nrefunding, professional advancement, and prestige, it<br />\noften becomes necessary for a<br /><br />\nscientist to produce results<br />\nwhich he does not really have,<br />\nor to report experiments which<br />\nhe has neither finished nor even<br />\nstarted. Although one would<br />\nlike to trust the processes of<br />\nreview mentioned above,<br />\nhistory shows them as fallible.<br />\nFor example, in the case of<br />\nmicrobiologist John Long,<br />\n\"there was a failure of all three<br />\nmechanisms to detect gross<br />\nfraud.\" Long worked at the<br />\nprestigious Massachusetts<br />\nGeneral Hospital as a cancer<br />\nresearcher<br />\ninvestigating<br />\nHodgkins disease. He succeeded where all other researchers<br />\nhad failed; he established<br />\nseveral cell lines of Hodgkins<br />\ndisease in the test tube, where<br />\nthey usually die after a short<br />\nperiod. The cells led Long to a<br />\nlong and respected research<br />\ncareer, during which his results<br />\nwere frequently published, including the Proceedings of the<br />\nNational Academy ofSciences.<br />\nHe was also awarded $759,000<br />\nfrom the National Institutes of<br />\nHealth to continue this<br />\nresearch.<br />\nLong became so productive<br />\nthat it led to his downfall. A<br />\njunior researcher was astonished at how fast Long completed<br />\nan experiment. After researching the matter, he proved<br />\nthat the experiment could not<br />\nhave taken place. \"It was later<br />\ndiscovered,\" said Wade,\"that<br />\nLong's cells were not even those<br />\nof a human. They were found<br />\nto belong to a northern Colombian brown-footed owl<br />\nmonkey.\" The chromosonial<br />\npatterns of the cells, clearly not<br />\nthose of a human being, occupied a half page in the Proceedings of the National<br />\nAcademy of Sciences. \"The<br /><br />\nmonkey cells,\" said Wade,<br />\n\"made monkeys out of just<br />\nabout everyone.\"<br />\nIn Long's case, the failure to<br />\ndetect such wrong-doing arose<br />\nfrom the respect for his position<br />\nas a distinguished researcher.<br />\nFurthermore, because science<br />\nand recognition in science are<br />\nbased on originality, no one<br />\nwould try to replicate results<br />\nwhich already appeared<br />\nestablished. Researchers' use of<br />\nraw data is also assumed to be<br />\nsacrosanct. \"Merely asking to<br />\nlook at raw data is tantamount<br />\nto an accusation.\"<br />\nTo illustrate this, Wade<br />\nrelated the experiment of<br />\npsychologist Robert Rawlins.<br />\nRawlins wrote to professors<br />\nwho had their experimental<br />\nresults published. In what is<br />\nprimarily the only way of verifying the truth of an experiment, researchers appeared to<br />\nbe quite inept. \"More than half<br />\nof the professors reported their<br />\ndata lost or destroyed. Of the<br />\nseven returned, three contained<br />\ngross errors.\"<br />\nBecause there are no clearcut rules for the attribution of<br />\ncredit in journal articles, many<br />\nprofessors can claim work that<br />\nis not really their own. The entire lab-chief-graduate student<br />\nrelationship is capable of being<br />\nexploited.<br />\nThe most shocking example<br />\nof this actually came to decide<br />\nthe 1974 Nobel Prize for<br />\nPhysics. Jocelyn Bell, a<br />\ngraduate student in astronomy<br />\nat Cambridge, was operating a<br />\nradio-dish antenna which she<br />\nhad built in her spare time.<br />\nWhile working on something<br />\nnot related to her project for<br />\nher advisor, she detected an extremely regular pulse of radio<br /><br />\nwaves. After notifying the<br />\ndirectors of the lab, \"the<br />\nBritish Parliament was informed that Cambridge was in contact with an extraterrestrial<br />\ncivilization.\"<br />\nAfter Bell detected a similar<br />\nradio source, the theory was<br />\nthrown out. What Bell actually discovered were pulsars. In<br />\n1974, the discovery was rewarded with the Nobel Prize.<br />\nHowever, because the published results appeared with Anthony Hewish, her lab-chief, as<br />\nfirst author, the prize committee decided to award him the<br />\nprize.<br />\nAnother enormously important factor in getting scientific<br />\nwork published is the rhetorical<br />\neffectiveness of the research<br />\nreport.

A greater<br />\nnumber of students became involved in the<br />\nplanning of the extravaganza this year and<br />\nseveral new activities, such as Fair Games,<br />\nhave been introduced to the agenda.<br />\nIn other words, Hopkins students should<br />\nnot only be prepared to tolerate this<br />\nmadness, bEtt also to enjoy and take advantage of this peculiar exception to the school's<br />\ngenerally non-existent social life.

Tyrus<br />\nimplied, in none too eloquent<br />\nterms, that I was racist, which<br />\nis totally unfounded. First of<br />\nall, a brief look at my personal<br />\nhistory will convince even the<br />\nmost wary skeptic (Tyrus included)that I am far from prejudiced; as a matter of fact I am<br />\non the other side of the spectrum. Also, analysis like Tyrus<br />\nmade of the entire Goetz situation is what makes it a racial attitude, not what really happened. If the four hoodlums were<br />\nblack, white, hispanic, or even<br />\npre-med, I still would have used Goetz's likeness and my<br />\nslogan on my posters. It did not<br />\nmatter to me that Mr. Goetz<br />\nwas white and the hoodlums<br />\nwere black, what mattered was<br />\nthat Mr. Goetz was standing up<br />\nfor his right to ride the subway<br />\nunmolested, and I wanted to<br />\nshow I would stand up for the<br />\nstudent's rights.<br />\nThis is the time when people<br />\nlike Tyrus spit out garbage like<br />\n\"but those four poor,<br />\nunemployed, unarmed, nice<br /><br />\nboys only asked for five dollars way he blamed the \"problems<br />\nso they could play video of unemployment and poverty\"<br />\ngames.\" Anyone who lives in for the way the hoodlums<br />\nthe real world knows what kind acted.

Two<br />\nstars.\" but I find them appallingly boring, as do many<br />\nothers.<br />\nJohn E. Burke<br /><br />\nStudent Apathy<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to discuss an<br />\nissue which has concerned me<br />\nsince my arrival at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University this<br />\nSeptember. The issue is \"student apathy.\" I hesitate to use<br />\nthe term \"student apathy,\" as<br />\nit has become somewhat colloquial here and lost some of its<br />\nimpact. Perhaps I should refer<br />\nto this phenomenon as \"mass<br />\ndisinterest,\" \"isolationism,\" or<br />\neven \"anti-socialism.\" In any<br />\ncase, it's frightening that<br /><br />\nstudents attending such a small<br />\nschool as this can be so indifferent to the events surrounding<br />\nthem.<br />\nI frequently hear students lament that Hopkins is devoid of<br />\nsocial life. People claim that<br />\nthere is simply nothing to do<br />\nhere. I think this is an utterly<br />\nridiculous attitude. As a<br />\nmember of many campus<br />\ngroups, I find my time very well<br />\noccupied by non-academic activities. Groups like the Dorm<br />\nCouncil Social Programming<br />\nCommittee and the Office of<br />\nResidential Life sponsor<br />\nnumerous activities. It takes<br />\ntwo things to make a social life:<br />\na medium and motivation. It is<br />\nnot the medium which is lacking here, but rather the participation on the part of the<br />\nstudents. A line from the<br />\n1984-85 Circular illustrates this<br />\npoint: \"Entertainment, concerts, plays, lectures, other<br />\ncultural events, and student activities are always available at<br />\nJohns Hopkins; it is up to you<br />\nto decide if you want to participate.\" If you decide that<br />\nyou will not participate, then<br />\nyou lose the right to complain<br />\nabout a meagre social life.<br />\nThere is no such thing as a prepackaged social life.

As I watched, I wondered why only<br />\nabout thirty people were protesting. This campus has over<br />\ntwo thousand undergraduates.<br />\nIs only one percent of the<br />\npopulation here concerned<br />\nabout the injustice of apartheid? Do supporters of antiapartheid legislation have to<br />\nresort to soliciting student<br />\nsignatures in the Terrace<br />\nRoom? Apparently so.<br />\nParticularly disheartening are<br />\nthe results of the recent class<br />\ncouncil elections. In each class,<br />\nunder forty-one percent of the<br />\neligible students voted. The<br />\nselection of class officers strikes<br />\nme as one of the issues which<br />\naffects the students most directly. Why is the voter turnout so<br />\npoor? We are content to complain about the negligible accomplishments of our class officers, but we are unwilling to<br />\nshow up at the polls to elect<br />\nmore competent people. Not<br />\nonly are the majority of<br />\nstudents unwilling to take part<br />\nin class elections, but there also,<br />\nappears to be a lack of interest<br />\non the part of potential candidates. Of the fifteen offices<br />\navailable in the three classes,<br /><br />\nfive candidates ran unopposed.<br />\nThese figures are disgraceful.<br />\nThe whole point of the voting<br />\nsystem is defeated.<br />\nWhat has happened here is<br />\nthat students are no longer<br />\nmotivated to participate in<br />\ncampus events. In times past,<br />\nstudents were motivated by a<br />\ndesire to learn, a desire to succeed, and a desire to develop<br />\nmore fully as individuals. These<br />\ndesires seem to have vanished<br />\ncompletely. What motivates<br />\nstudents nowadays? I fear that<br />\nit is pursuit of grades, fulfillment of degree requirements,<br />\nand enhancement of resumes. I<br />\nwould hate to think that we are<br />\ncultivating a race of individuals<br />\nwho are motivated by nothing<br />\nother than greed and selfinterest, or worse, by nothing at<br />\nall.<br />\nThere is no excuse for<br />\napathy. The amount of effort<br />\nit takes to become involved is<br />\njustified by the rewards. The<br />\ntime has come for us to take a<br />\ngood look at ourselves. If we<br />\ncontinue on the course of nonparticipation, our sheltered<br />\nwill<br />\ngradually<br />\nsociety<br />\ndeteriorate and eventually cease<br />\nto function.

Because the officers<br />\nof my class neglected to show<br />\nup at the meeting at which the<br />\nSAC budgets were assigned.<br />\nMy question is this: How can<br /><br />\nwe elect to public office people students place in them?<br />\nwho can't be bothered to fulfill<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nthe minimal responsibilities of<br />\nMike Kupritz<br />\ntheir offices? I am outraged,<br />\nClass of 1988<br />\noffended, and embarrassed by<br />\nthe blatant disregard for<br />\nresponsibilities which my class<br />\nofficers have shown. I realize<br />\nthat expecting class officers to<br />\nkeep their campaign promises is<br />\nit<br />\nis<br />\nbut<br />\nridiculous,<br />\nunreasonable for me to expect<br />\nelected officials to behave with<br />\na minimum of consideration<br />\nfor the trust that their fellow<br /><br />\nNext Week...<br />\nThe Final Issue<br /><br />\nLet's Talk About the Why of National Service<br />\none of the American military<br />\nbases in Honduras.

M.<br />\nDouglas Jones, M.D., the<br />\nClinical Director of the<br />\nNeonatal Intensive Care Unit<br />\n(NICU) at Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, recently spoke at the<br />\nSchool of Continuing Studies<br />\nof the NICU.<br />\nThe ventilator that is used today in neonatal nurseries is a<br />\nstraightforward device much<br />\nsimpler than those which<br />\npreceded it. Oxygen gas flows<br />\nin one side of a tube that has a<br />\nbranch, which is called an en-<br /><br />\ndotracheal tube, that goes into<br />\nthe baby's lungs. The baby can<br />\nactually breath in and out at<br />\nwill from this moving stream of<br />\nair. At the end of the stream is<br />\na valve that can be controlled in<br />\nseveral ways according to time.<br />\nThere is an electrical timer that<br />\ncloses the valve at designated<br />\nintervals. The air pressure controlled by the valve builds up in<br />\nthe tube to a predetermined<br />\namount, forcing air into the<br />\nbaby's lungs. Resistance to this<br />\npressure indicates diseased<br />\ntissue. The more lung disease<br />\nthe baby has, the less volume<br />\nthat will enter for any given<br />\npressure. Lungs can consequently become thick and<br />\nswollen.<br />\nThe design of this ventilator<br />\nkeeps a \"constant positive airway pressure\" at all times,<br />\nwhich stabilizes the baby's<br />\nlungs so they won't collapse<br />\ncompletely between breaths.<br /><br />\nThe main advantage to this ventilator is that when the baby<br />\nstarts to improve, it can do a lot<br />\nof breathing on its own, thus<br />\ndecreasing<br />\nsignificantly<br />\nneonatal mortality. The timer is<br />\noriginally set at 150 breaths per<br />\nminute. As the baby improves,<br />\nthis rate is gradually lowered<br />\nuntil the infant can breath by<br />\nitself. With the old ventilator<br />\ndesigns, babies were either on'<br />\nor off the ventilator, since most<br />\nbabies couldn't tolerate this<br />\ndrastic change, the mortality<br />\nrates were high. The ability to<br />\nwean the baby off the ventilator<br />\nin the last 10-15 years is responsible for the doubling of the<br />\nsurvival rate for babies suffering from respiratory distress<br />\nsyndrome, which is due to<br />\npremature lungs.<br />\nA routine procedure as simple as taking a blood pressure<br />\ncannot be done the same way in<br />\ninfants as in adults.

A machine called a<br />\nDoppler Device was recently<br />\ndeveloped. This machine,<br />\nwhich costs $400, is cheap in<br />\nterms of medical care. It works<br />\non the same principle as that of<br />\na sound heard from a train<br />\npassing by. As the train travels,<br />\nthe diesel horn emits a highpitched sound as it approaches<br />\nand a low-pitched sound as it<br />\ndeparts.

Well, whether you choose to<br />\nnotice it or not, a hundred<br />\nthousand strangers will descend<br />\nupon Homewood today in an<br />\nattempt to rescue you from<br />\nboredom. The paths to the Hut<br />\nwill be strewn with garbage, lost<br />\nchildren, and passed-out<br />\npedestrians.

Go to the lower quad<br />\nand indulge in a little Elvis or<br />\nmaybe a technicolor landscape.<br />\nOther good bets are wood-andstraw plaques, bread dough art,<br />\nor self-portraits. The wealth of<br />\ntalent displayed by unpretentious artists on the brink of<br />\nfame puts the Baltimore<br />\nmuseum of Art's collection to<br />\nshame.

It<br />\nis here in New Jersey that the<br />\ncat wanders into its second<br />\nstory. Actually, this is not so<br />\nmuch a story as it is an idea: a<br />\nguy crawls around the ledge of<br />\na skyscraper. That's it. Oh,<br />\nthere's a smattering of<br />\ncharacterization, as well as a little bit of set-up thrown in for<br />\ngood measure; for the most<br />\npart, though, such elements are<br />\nnonexistent here.<br />\nRobert Hays(Airplane) is the<br />\nledge walker, doing so as part<br />\nof a wager where the stakes are<br />\nwhether or not he can have his<br />\ngirlfriend (the wife of the man<br />\nwho makes Hays the offer he<br />\ncan't refuse) and whether or<br />\nnot he wIl be set up with heroin<br />\nfor the police. Hays's tour of<br />\nthe ledge takes up an inordinate<br />\namount of the story, and by the<br />\ntime the conclusion arrives, the<br />\nviewer has had ample time to<br />\ncalculate what the surprise of<br />\nthe surprise ending will be. The<br />\nstory is so short on plot that the<br /><br />\nonly surprise at all lies in the<br />\nfact that King and Teague<br />\nchose to put it on celluloid instead of a more worthy story,<br />\nwhere the ledge walking could<br />\nbe the climax.<br />\nAt long last, the cat arrives at<br />\nits Wilmington, North Carolina<br />\ndestination to help Ms. Barrymore combat the evil troll<br />\nwhich resides in her bedroom<br />\nwall. This six-inch tall<br />\nGremlins-inspired creature<br />\n(created by Carlo Rambaldi)<br />\nrears its ugly little head at night,<br />\ncausing Barrymore to have<br />\nnightmares as the creature attempts to steal her breath. The<br />\ncat, who is being called<br />\n\"General\" by Drew, knows his<br />\nresponsibility and sets out to<br />\ndestroy this dagger-wielding<br />\nmonster in the court jester's<br />\ncap. Unfortunately, complications occur in the form of a cathating mother who tries to have<br />\nGeneral put to sleep.<br />\nThis episode may rank above<br />\nthe others in terms of clever<br />\nspecial effects, but it is<br />\nsomewhere between the other<br /><br />\ntwo in terms of a quality<br />\nstoryline. Surprisingly, none of<br />\nthe three stories really contains<br />\nthe horror with which the<br />\nauthor's name has become<br />\nsynonymous. Rather, it seems<br />\nas if Mr. King was more inspired by 0. Henry than his<br />\nown past works. Granted, the<br />\nstories may be a touch more<br />\ngruesome than those Henry<br />\nmight have committed to<br />\npaper, but those endings with<br />\nthe surprise twists are everpresent in the Cat's Eye tales.<br />\nNone of Cat's Eye can be<br />\ncalled truly bad. The second<br />\nepisode may be plotless, but it<br />\ndoes what it does well.

Moving to the<br />\nsecond line were senior tricaptain John Krumenacker and<br />\nsophomore Bruce Chanenchuk.<br />\nAt the third position, Zimmerman alternated freshman Joe<br />\nRzempoluch and senior Glenn<br /><br />\nFidje.<br />\n\"I wanted to shake things up<br />\na lot,\" said the coach afterwards. \"I was very pleased with<br />\nJohn Dressel's performance\u2014<br />\nit's hard for a freshman to do<br />\nwell against Army.

Hopkins was on top to<br />\nstay.<br />\nThe Blue Jays kept up the<br />\npressure as they dominated on<br />\nthe ground balls, and the offense controlled the tempo of<br />\nthe game. \"Last week the ball<br />\nbounced their [Carolina's]<br />\nway,\" explained Mutscheller.<br />\n\"We didn't want to get beat<br />\nagain on the ground balls.\"<br />\nEven a missed one-on-one<br />\nopportunity by junior attackman Geoff Nordberg did<br />\nnot slow the Jay attack.<br />\nAgain it was a fast break<br />\nwhich led to a Hopkins tally.<br />\nThis time, however, it was the<br /><br />\nwas<br /><br />\nmoved to the first midfield line last week.<br /><br />\naggressive, double-teaming style as Morrill tallied once<br />\ndefense of Mutscheller and again and Del Dressel and<br />\nDressel which gave them the Mutscheller teamed up on a<br />\nopportunity.

As soon as the sprint<br />\nstarted, though, Hopkins passed Washington with ease, and<br />\nbegan an amazing move on the<br /><br />\nfront runners, Washington's A<br />\nboat in first and George Mason<br />\nin second, to the expressed<br />\nastonishment of spectators, officials, and announcers. Gaining with each stroke, the<br />\nwomen almost passed George<br />\nMason, in the end losing by less<br />\nthan a fifth of a length (about<br />\n10 feet) and thereby finishing<br />\nthird.<br />\nHaving once again been<br /><br />\nHapless Linksters Drop to 0-7<br />\nand cross-town rival Loyola.<br />\nStill playing below potential,<br />\nThe Hopkins linksters will the Blue Jays posted a season<br />\nface.yet another losing season low of 450 at Newark Country<br />\nthis year, and they have only Club against an undefeated<br />\nthemselves to blame.

Todd Stefan and Ed<br />\nMizumoto carded 89's, but the<br />\ndisappointment of the day<br />\ncame from sophomore Paul<br />\nKadri. Kadri bloated to a 98,<br />\nand later said, \"I had matters<br />\nof state on my mind.\"<br />\nOn Monday against York at<br />\nhome, it appeared the Blue Jays<br />\nwere about to snatch their first<br />\nvictory; but alas, numbers one<br />\nand three players Ashu Handa<br />\nand Steve Schiller could not<br />\nmake tee-off time due to heavy<br />\nacademic pressures.

Ed<br />\nMizumoto tried his level best to<br />\nkeep Hopkins in the game by<br />\nmaking several birdies on the<br />\nback nine, but still scored only<br />\n93. Jack Savitz had 4 \"quints\"<br />\non his own, falling back into<br />\ntriple digits with 105.<br />\nSteve Schiller, sporting a<br />\nbrand new \"tiger shark\" putter, 3-putted nine greens, until<br />\nhe finally went back to his 3<br />\niron.
