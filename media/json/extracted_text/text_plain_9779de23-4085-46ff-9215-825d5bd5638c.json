Rowland,<br />\nAmerica's greatest physicist.<br /><br />\nJust forty seven years ago, he<br />\nbegan his first experiments to redetermine this most important<br />\nphysical constant. The problem<br />\nof determining its value had interested scientists for a century.<br />\nIn , 1798.a rough.value -was obtained by Count Rumford. The most<br />\nextended work was done by<br />\nJoule, the English physicist, who<br />\nexperimented from 1845 to 1878.<br />\nOthers tried the problem with<br />\nthe result that thirty seven values of the constant had been published when Rowland resolved to<br />\nsettle the discrepancy once for all.<br />\nHe began his elaborate research<br />\nin January, 1878, two years after<br />\nhe accepted the chair of physics<br />\nat the newly-formed University.<br />\nHe used the paddle-wheel method<br />\nof Joule, but he improved the apparatus to a degree never before<br />\nattained. Rowland's love for accuracy led him to take. the most<br />\npainstaking measu-res to eliminate<br />\nevery error which might affect his<br />\nresults. Studies in thermometry<br />\nand the specific heat of water<br />\nwere simultaneously conducted<br />\nwith the investigation of the mechanical equivalent of heat.
