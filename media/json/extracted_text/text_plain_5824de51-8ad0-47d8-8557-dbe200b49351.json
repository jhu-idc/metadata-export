BOND<br />\nRepublican National Chairman<br />\nRay.Bliss was dead wrong when he<br />\nsaid the November 7 election results indicate \"that the upsurge in<br />\nRepublican strength which began<br />\nin 1966 is continuing.\" In reality,<br />\nit was a poor night for the GOP.<br />\nRepublican gains in New Jersey,<br />\nKentucky, and Hartford, Conn.<br />\nmust be deemed truly insignificant when considering the Democrats swept control of nine major<br />\nU.S. cities: San Francisco, San Diego, Gary,Cleveland, Toledo, New<br />\nHaven, Boston, Philadelphia, and<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nHere at home, the humiliation<br />\nstemming from the mayorality<br />\nrace was not due to Arthur Sherwood's defeat, but because he was<br />\nliterally creamed. It was a foregone conclusion to everyone that<br />\nSherwood would lose; his campaign was admittedly an \"exercise in futility.\" But to think that<br />\nhe received less than 20 per cent<br />\nof the popular vote, coupled with<br />\nthe fact that Democrats uniformly<br />\ndefeated Republican (with one exception) in all six City Council<br />\ndistricts by overwhelming margins from 3-1 to 10-1, leads one to<br />\nask the question: \"What ever happened to the two-party system in<br />\nBaltimore?\" If it ever was, it surely is dead now.<br />\nThe factors which explain Baltimore's one party inanopoly begin<br />\nwith the Democrats' commanding,<br />\nfive to one voter registration margin. Baltimoreans are known to<br />\nhappily cross lines if the other<br />\n<br />\nparty presents a better man. Thus,<br />\nTheodore McKeldin and Spiro<br />\nAgnew have carried the day in recent elections. A more significant<br />\nfactor is evidenced by the continuous emmigration of the usually<br />\nRepublican middle and high income families, leaving the city<br />\nlimits inhabited by low-income<br />\npersons and minority groups - who<br />\nremain hypnotized by the New<br />\nDeal era and are, therefore, loyally<br />\nDemocratic.<br />\nMost important, one must consider the campaign itself. Political<br />\ntheory has it that the best way to<br />\nupset a one-party monopoly is for<br />\nthe out-party to sponsor extremely<br />\nattractive candidates. Again, McKeldin and Agnew are prime examples. In many ways Sherwood<br />\ncould have been attractive to the<br />\nvoters, but in fact he was not.<br />\nFirst,Sherwood received negligible<br />\nsupport from his own party. No<br />\none wants to back a loser; thus,<br />\nthere were no finances for a dynamic publicity campaign. In addition, there was no campaign organization, no volunteer corp ringing doorbells, no active \"youth<br />\nfor Sherwood.\"<br />\nSecond, there was Sherwood<br />\nhimself: a nice guy, and all that,<br />\nbut hardly the \"John Lindsay of<br />\nBaltimore\". He failed to motivate<br />\nand inspire his partisans the way<br />\nAgnew did in 1966. His public<br />\nimpression was many times that of<br />\nfrustrated and confused man not<br />\nsure at all of what he was supposed<br />\nto be doing. Thus, as the results<br />\nshow, he didn't instill much coot -<br />\n<br />\ndence in the voters.Yet, in priyate.<br />\nSherwood was no coward He<br />\nstood up against the war, accosted<br />\nthe Great Society for lack of federal revenues to rebuild his city,<br />\nand deplored the corruption embedded in his opposition.<br />\nFinally, there was Tommy<br />\nD'Alesandro III - - Baltimore's<br />\nMayor-elect. He pocketed the<br />\nmonopoly on everything: the magnetic name, billboards, bus signs,<br />\nT.V. - radio advertisement (\"The<br />\nAnswer is D'Alesandro<br />\n\"), and<br />\nthe votes: five of his to every one<br />\nof Sherwood's. He couldn't lose<br />\nshort of a national catastrophy.<br />\nThus, he aired no issues, presented<br />\nno alternatives, and made no rational appeals. He didn't have to;<br />\nhe won the mayorship in the Democratic primary.<br />\nThe tragedy of this election is<br />\nnot that the Republicans ought to<br />\nhave won. D'Alesandro probably<br />\nwon't do anything so terrible as<br />\nmight have required Sherwood to<br />\nsave Baltimoreans from it. The<br />\ntragedy is that there is no longer a<br />\nhealthy two-party system. D'Alesandro is accountable only to his<br />\nparty, not to Baltimore citizens.<br />\nSince there is no loyal opposition<br />\nto check his administration,<br />\nD'Alesandro is free to govern as he<br />\npleases.

I refer, of course, to Champert<br />\nSigafoos.<br />\nChampert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on<br />\na farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both<br />\nnamed Walter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became<br />\na bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to<br />\nMontana where he got a job with a logging firm. Here the<br />\nerstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After<br />\na month he went to North Dakota where he tended the<br />\nfurnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to<br />\nTexas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to<br />\nArLona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then<br />\nto Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oattoter). Then to Long Island where he dressed poultry<br />\n(duck-plucker). Then to Alaska where he drove a delivery<br />\nvan for a bakery (bread-sledder). Then to Minnesota<br />\nwhere he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada<br />\nwhere he determined the odds in a gambling house (dicepricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera<br />\nlenses together (Zeiss-splicer).<br />\nFinally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tannery, beating pig hides until they were soft and supple<br />\n(hog-flogger). Here occurred the event that changed not<br />\nonly Champert's life, but all of ours.<br />\nNext door to Champert's hog-floggery was a mooring<br />\nmast for dirigibles. In flew a dirigible one day, piloted by<br />\na girl named Graffa von Zeppelin. Champert watched<br />\nGraffa descend from the dirigible, and his heart turned<br />\nover, and he knew love. Though Graffa's beauty was not<br />\nquite perfect\u2014one of her legs was shorter than the other<br />\n(blimp-gimper)\u2014she was nonetheless ravishing, what<br />\nwith her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and<br />\nher marvelously articulated haunches. Champert,smitten,<br />\nran quickly back to the hog-fioggery to plan the wooing.<br />\nTo begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a present. This presented problems, for hog-flogging, as we all<br />\nknow, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought<br />\nChampert, if he had no money, there were two things he<br />\ndid have: ingenuity and pigskin.<br />\nSo he selected several high grade pelts and stitched<br />\nthem together and blew air into them and made for Graffa<br />\na perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. \"She will<br />\nlove this,\" said he confidently to himself and proceeded to<br />\nmake ready to call on Graffa.<br />\nFirst, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades. And wouldn't you? If you were looking<br />\nto impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory,<br />\ndewlaps like damask,a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome,<br />\nupper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that<br />\nwhisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and<br />\nnicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not,<br />\nin short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style<br />\nand double-edge style? Of course you would.<br />\n<br />\nSo Champert, his face a study in epidermal elegance,<br />\nrushed next door with his little pigskin dirigible. But<br />\nGraffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who specialized in dropping limes to scurvy-ridden Eskimo villages (fruit-chuter).<br />\nChampert, enraged, started kicking his little pigskin<br />\nblimp all over the place. And who should walk by just<br />\nthen but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and<br />\nPete Rozelle!<br />\nThey walked silently, heads down, four discouraged<br />\nmen. For weeks they had been trying to invent football,<br />\nbut they couldn't seem to find the right kind of ball. They<br />\ntried everything\u2014hockey pucks, badminton birds, bowling<br />\nballs, quoits\u2014but nothing worked. Now seeing Champert<br />\nkicking his pigskin spheroid, their faces lit up and as one<br />\nman they hollered \"Eureka!\" The rest is history.<br />\n* * *<br />\n\u00a91967, Max Shulman<br />\nSpeaking of kicks, if you've got any about your present shave cream, try Burma-Shave, regular or menthol.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, DECEMBER 1, 1967<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE EIGHT<br />\n<br />\nMacksey<br />\n(Continued from Page 7)<br />\n<br />\nginative experimental program.<br />\nThey received substantial advice<br />\nand encouragement from men in<br />\nthe profession as well as from Dr.<br />\nEisenhower and Mr. Walters of the<br />\nHopkins Fund.

Peabody of the Political<br />\nScience Department,entitled \"Party Leadership Changes in the<br />\nHouse of Representatives\", caused<br />\na stir in Washington last week.<br />\nDr. Peabody's article, which<br />\nappeared in the American Political<br />\nScience Review, presented nonpartisan survey of Democratic and<br />\nDr. Richard Macksey Republican leadership in the House<br />\nsince.1955. According to Peabody,<br />\nFROSH B-BALL<br />\nthe Washington Post, in an editorial on Nov. 20, misused this article<br />\nThere will be a freshman<br />\nas the basis for an attack on Debasketball scrimmage against<br />\nmocratic leadership in general, and<br />\nthe University of Maryland,<br />\nHouse Speaker John McCormack<br />\nBaltimore County campus on<br />\nin particular.<br />\nMonday, Dec. 4, at 4:00 p.m.<br />\nThe Post editorial said that<br />\nthe Speaker McCormack \"is no<br />\nFRESHMAN LACROSSE<br />\nlonger in touch with the dynamic<br />\nThere will be an organiza- elements in his party in the House\"<br />\ntional meeting today at 4:30 and that his \"continuation in the<br />\np.m. in the Athletic Center Speakership is a symbol of the<br />\nacute hardening of the arteries<br />\nClassroom for all potential<br />\nfrom which the Congress in genfreshman lacrosse candidates.<br />\n4 eral is suffering\". According to the<br />\n<br />\nGridders Gain Championship;<br />\nReverse Long Losing Streak<br />\n<br />\nPost, Dr. Peabody explains Speaker McCormack's long tenure by<br />\nstating that it is due to the majority status of the Democrats.<br />\nHowever, Dr. Peabody states<br />\nthat he did not infer that Speaker<br />\nMcCormack's position was merely<br />\nan effect of Democratic majority,<br />\nbut also because of the method by<br />\nwhich the Democrats select their<br />\nleaders. While Dr. Peabody said<br />\nthat \"the longer the period of<br />\nmajority status, the more likely<br />\nthe majority party is to develop<br />\nestablished patterns ofsuccession,\"<br />\nhe did not say that this is peculiar<br />\nto the Democrats as the editorial<br />\nimplies.<br />\nThe Post editorial states that<br />\n\"the Republican changes were<br />\nbrought about, not by routine advancement up the leadership ladder, but by means of revolts within the party which led to vigorous<br />\ncontests,\" and advocates these \"revolts within the party\" as the best<br />\nway to solve leadership problems<br />\nin Congress.<br />\nDr. Peabody stated that this<br />\ncharacteristic stems from the fact<br />\nthat the GOP is \"more prone to<br />\nintra-party leadership changes<br />\nthrough contested means\", whereas the Democrats more often<br />\nchoose their leaders on the basis<br />\nof seniority. Dr. Peabody does not<br />\nsay that either method is good or<br />\nbad per se.<br />\nDr. Peabody did say that<br />\n\"House Republicans can take some<br />\nconsolation from one by-product<br />\nof overwhelming election defeats<br />\n- - it moves able younger members into position of high rank far<br />\nquick than any other means.\"<br />\n<br />\n10)<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nyear's<br />\nthis<br />\nin<br />\ntant factors<br />\nThe boys - especially the captains,<br />\nMark Perlmutter and Denny Ferrazzano seemed ready to shake off<br />\nthe tradition of losing and apathy<br />\naround here, and they did.\"<br />\nThe copious pre-game press<br />\ncoverage for the Hopkins-Western<br />\nMaryland clash of November 18, a<br />\ncontest of little practical concern<br />\nbut much symbolic importance,<br />\nseemed to center on a purported<br />\nduel between Joe Cowan and the<br />\nTerrors' ostensibly \u2014 rough defense; but, it was unsung soph<br />\nhalfback Weiss, who had been doing the team's heavy running all<br />\nyear, who finally moved into the<br />\nlimelight. Moving for 195 yeards on<br />\n30 carries including a 34 yard T.D.<br />\nrun, a performance that made him<br />\nthe Southern Division M.A.C.'s<br />\ntop rusher for the year, the 5-11,<br />\n190 pound setback was the key<br />\nfigure in Hopkins' hard-fought<br />\n13-6 win.<br />\nAfter somewhat dominating a<br />\nscoreless first half, the Jays went<br />\nahead 7-0 on Weiss's jaunt following a fumble recovery. After another Hopkins thrust was stopped inside the Terror ten yard line, the<br />\nWestminster club took off on a<br />\n96 yard T.D. drive, but its twopoint conversion try failed. The<br />\nHomewood squad then iced the<br />\nwin via a late scoring march capped by Mark Croft's short plunge.<br />\nThe triumph left Hopkins atop the<br />\nSouthern Division at 6-0; Western<br />\nMaryland and F&M were next at<br />\n3-2.<br />\nThe Western Maryland clash also marked the final Hopkins foot(Continued from Page<br />\n<br />\nOPEI<br />\n<br />\nEle l= =If I= =111 =M 11111 I= =I<br />\n<br />\n\" College Relations Director<br />\nI c/o Sheraton-Park Hotel, Washington, D.C. 20008<br />\n<br />\n\"Idon't have<br />\ntwo years'experience.<br />\nIhave oneyeartwice<br />\nSome people get experience<br />\nin a job.<br />\nOther people get older.<br />\nThere's a big difference.

It was a foregone conclusion to everyone that<br />\nSherwood would lose; his campaign was admittedly an \"exercise in futility.\" But to think that<br />\nhe received less than 20 per cent<br />\nof the popular vote, coupled with<br />\nthe fact that Democrats uniformly<br />\ndefeated Republican (with one exception) in all six City Council<br />\ndistricts by overwhelming margins from 3-1 to 10-1, leads one to<br />\nask the question: \"What ever happened to the two-party system in<br />\nBaltimore?\" If it ever was, it surely is dead now.<br />\nThe factors which explain Baltimore's one party inanopoly begin<br />\nwith the Democrats' commanding,<br />\nfive to one voter registration margin. Baltimoreans are known to<br />\nhappily cross lines if the other<br /><br />\nparty presents a better man. Thus,<br />\nTheodore McKeldin and Spiro<br />\nAgnew have carried the day in recent elections. A more significant<br />\nfactor is evidenced by the continuous emmigration of the usually<br />\nRepublican middle and high income families, leaving the city<br />\nlimits inhabited by low-income<br />\npersons and minority groups - who<br />\nremain hypnotized by the New<br />\nDeal era and are, therefore, loyally<br />\nDemocratic.<br />\nMost important, one must consider the campaign itself. Political<br />\ntheory has it that the best way to<br />\nupset a one-party monopoly is for<br />\nthe out-party to sponsor extremely<br />\nattractive candidates. Again, McKeldin and Agnew are prime examples. In many ways Sherwood<br />\ncould have been attractive to the<br />\nvoters, but in fact he was not.<br />\nFirst,Sherwood received negligible<br />\nsupport from his own party. No<br />\none wants to back a loser; thus,<br />\nthere were no finances for a dynamic publicity campaign. In addition, there was no campaign organization, no volunteer corp ringing doorbells, no active \"youth<br />\nfor Sherwood.\"<br />\nSecond, there was Sherwood<br />\nhimself: a nice guy, and all that,<br />\nbut hardly the \"John Lindsay of<br />\nBaltimore\". He failed to motivate<br />\nand inspire his partisans the way<br />\nAgnew did in 1966. His public<br />\nimpression was many times that of<br />\nfrustrated and confused man not<br />\nsure at all of what he was supposed<br />\nto be doing. Thus, as the results<br />\nshow, he didn't instill much coot -<br /><br />\ndence in the voters.Yet, in priyate.<br />\nSherwood was no coward He<br />\nstood up against the war, accosted<br />\nthe Great Society for lack of federal revenues to rebuild his city,<br />\nand deplored the corruption embedded in his opposition.<br />\nFinally, there was Tommy<br />\nD'Alesandro III - - Baltimore's<br />\nMayor-elect. He pocketed the<br />\nmonopoly on everything: the magnetic name, billboards, bus signs,<br />\nT.V. - radio advertisement (\"The<br />\nAnswer is D'Alesandro<br />\n\"), and<br />\nthe votes: five of his to every one<br />\nof Sherwood's.

D'Alesandro probably<br />\nwon't do anything so terrible as<br />\nmight have required Sherwood to<br />\nsave Baltimoreans from it. The<br />\ntragedy is that there is no longer a<br />\nhealthy two-party system.

For instance, two years ago Dean Shaffer<br />\nmanaged to find $400 somewhere<br />\nin the machinery so that a group<br />\nof students could complete a narrative film based on Kafka's \"Ein<br />\nBrudermord.\" The recent purchase<br />\nof a print of this film by the Enoch<br /><br />\nsupport current fihn projects<br />\n(which are also aided by a grant<br />\nfrom the SAC).

I refer, of course, to Champert<br />\nSigafoos.<br />\nChampert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on<br />\na farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both<br />\nnamed Walter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became<br />\na bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to<br />\nMontana where he got a job with a logging firm. Here the<br />\nerstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After<br />\na month he went to North Dakota where he tended the<br />\nfurnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to<br />\nTexas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to<br />\nArLona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then<br />\nto Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oattoter). Then to Long Island where he dressed poultry<br />\n(duck-plucker). Then to Alaska where he drove a delivery<br />\nvan for a bakery (bread-sledder). Then to Minnesota<br />\nwhere he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada<br />\nwhere he determined the odds in a gambling house (dicepricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera<br />\nlenses together (Zeiss-splicer).<br />\nFinally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tannery, beating pig hides until they were soft and supple<br />\n(hog-flogger). Here occurred the event that changed not<br />\nonly Champert's life, but all of ours.<br />\nNext door to Champert's hog-floggery was a mooring<br />\nmast for dirigibles. In flew a dirigible one day, piloted by<br />\na girl named Graffa von Zeppelin. Champert watched<br />\nGraffa descend from the dirigible, and his heart turned<br />\nover, and he knew love. Though Graffa's beauty was not<br />\nquite perfect\u2014one of her legs was shorter than the other<br />\n(blimp-gimper)\u2014she was nonetheless ravishing, what<br />\nwith her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and<br />\nher marvelously articulated haunches. Champert,smitten,<br />\nran quickly back to the hog-fioggery to plan the wooing.<br />\nTo begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a present. This presented problems, for hog-flogging, as we all<br />\nknow, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought<br />\nChampert, if he had no money, there were two things he<br />\ndid have: ingenuity and pigskin.<br />\nSo he selected several high grade pelts and stitched<br />\nthem together and blew air into them and made for Graffa<br />\na perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. \"She will<br />\nlove this,\" said he confidently to himself and proceeded to<br />\nmake ready to call on Graffa.<br />\nFirst, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades. And wouldn't you? If you were looking<br />\nto impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory,<br />\ndewlaps like damask,a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome,<br />\nupper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that<br />\nwhisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and<br />\nnicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not,<br />\nin short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style<br />\nand double-edge style? Of course you would.<br /><br />\nSo Champert, his face a study in epidermal elegance,<br />\nrushed next door with his little pigskin dirigible. But<br />\nGraffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who specialized in dropping limes to scurvy-ridden Eskimo villages (fruit-chuter).<br />\nChampert, enraged, started kicking his little pigskin<br />\nblimp all over the place. And who should walk by just<br />\nthen but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and<br />\nPete Rozelle!<br />\nThey walked silently, heads down, four discouraged<br />\nmen. For weeks they had been trying to invent football,<br />\nbut they couldn't seem to find the right kind of ball. They<br />\ntried everything\u2014hockey pucks, badminton birds, bowling<br />\nballs, quoits\u2014but nothing worked. Now seeing Champert<br />\nkicking his pigskin spheroid, their faces lit up and as one<br />\nman they hollered \"Eureka!\" The rest is history.<br />\n* * *<br />\n\u00a91967, Max Shulman<br />\nSpeaking of kicks, if you've got any about your present shave cream, try Burma-Shave, regular or menthol.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, DECEMBER 1, 1967<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE EIGHT<br /><br />\nMacksey<br />\n(Continued from Page 7)<br /><br />\nginative experimental program.<br />\nThey received substantial advice<br />\nand encouragement from men in<br />\nthe profession as well as from Dr.<br />\nEisenhower and Mr. Walters of the<br />\nHopkins Fund.

Peabody of the Political<br />\nScience Department,entitled \"Party Leadership Changes in the<br />\nHouse of Representatives\", caused<br />\na stir in Washington last week.<br />\nDr. Peabody's article, which<br />\nappeared in the American Political<br />\nScience Review, presented nonpartisan survey of Democratic and<br />\nDr. Richard Macksey Republican leadership in the House<br />\nsince.1955. According to Peabody,<br />\nFROSH B-BALL<br />\nthe Washington Post, in an editorial on Nov. 20, misused this article<br />\nThere will be a freshman<br />\nas the basis for an attack on Debasketball scrimmage against<br />\nmocratic leadership in general, and<br />\nthe University of Maryland,<br />\nHouse Speaker John McCormack<br />\nBaltimore County campus on<br />\nin particular.<br />\nMonday, Dec. 4, at 4:00 p.m.<br />\nThe Post editorial said that<br />\nthe Speaker McCormack \"is no<br />\nFRESHMAN LACROSSE<br />\nlonger in touch with the dynamic<br />\nThere will be an organiza- elements in his party in the House\"<br />\ntional meeting today at 4:30 and that his \"continuation in the<br />\np.m. in the Athletic Center Speakership is a symbol of the<br />\nacute hardening of the arteries<br />\nClassroom for all potential<br />\nfrom which the Congress in genfreshman lacrosse candidates.<br />\n4 eral is suffering\". According to the<br /><br />\nGridders Gain Championship;<br />\nReverse Long Losing Streak<br /><br />\nPost, Dr. Peabody explains Speaker McCormack's long tenure by<br />\nstating that it is due to the majority status of the Democrats.<br />\nHowever, Dr. Peabody states<br />\nthat he did not infer that Speaker<br />\nMcCormack's position was merely<br />\nan effect of Democratic majority,<br />\nbut also because of the method by<br />\nwhich the Democrats select their<br />\nleaders. While Dr. Peabody said<br />\nthat \"the longer the period of<br />\nmajority status, the more likely<br />\nthe majority party is to develop<br />\nestablished patterns ofsuccession,\"<br />\nhe did not say that this is peculiar<br />\nto the Democrats as the editorial<br />\nimplies.<br />\nThe Post editorial states that<br />\n\"the Republican changes were<br />\nbrought about, not by routine advancement up the leadership ladder, but by means of revolts within the party which led to vigorous<br />\ncontests,\" and advocates these \"revolts within the party\" as the best<br />\nway to solve leadership problems<br />\nin Congress.<br />\nDr. Peabody stated that this<br />\ncharacteristic stems from the fact<br />\nthat the GOP is \"more prone to<br />\nintra-party leadership changes<br />\nthrough contested means\", whereas the Democrats more often<br />\nchoose their leaders on the basis<br />\nof seniority. Dr. Peabody does not<br />\nsay that either method is good or<br />\nbad per se.<br />\nDr. Peabody did say that<br />\n\"House Republicans can take some<br />\nconsolation from one by-product<br />\nof overwhelming election defeats<br />\n- - it moves able younger members into position of high rank far<br />\nquick than any other means.\"<br /><br />\n10)<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nyear's<br />\nthis<br />\nin<br />\ntant factors<br />\nThe boys - especially the captains,<br />\nMark Perlmutter and Denny Ferrazzano seemed ready to shake off<br />\nthe tradition of losing and apathy<br />\naround here, and they did.\"<br />\nThe copious pre-game press<br />\ncoverage for the Hopkins-Western<br />\nMaryland clash of November 18, a<br />\ncontest of little practical concern<br />\nbut much symbolic importance,<br />\nseemed to center on a purported<br />\nduel between Joe Cowan and the<br />\nTerrors' ostensibly \u2014 rough defense; but, it was unsung soph<br />\nhalfback Weiss, who had been doing the team's heavy running all<br />\nyear, who finally moved into the<br />\nlimelight. Moving for 195 yeards on<br />\n30 carries including a 34 yard T.D.<br />\nrun, a performance that made him<br />\nthe Southern Division M.A.C.'s<br />\ntop rusher for the year, the 5-11,<br />\n190 pound setback was the key<br />\nfigure in Hopkins' hard-fought<br />\n13-6 win.<br />\nAfter somewhat dominating a<br />\nscoreless first half, the Jays went<br />\nahead 7-0 on Weiss's jaunt following a fumble recovery.

Of further<br />\nimportance was the equally-sized<br />\nupcoming sophomore group - most<br />\nimportantly, defensive tackles Jim<br />\nLotto and Ken Brown, halfback<br />\nPaul Weiss, offensive linemen Bill<br />\nNcrsesian and Mike Wilbanks, and<br />\nlinebacker-end Wil Rholfing \u2014<br />\nfrom 1966's undefeated freshman<br />\ngroup.<br />\nNewcomers Shine<br />\nMore surprising -- and certainly<br />\nvital to Coach Alex Sotir's planned<br />\ntwo-platoon system \u2014 were the<br />\nperformances of a group of playrs absent for varying lengths of<br />\ntime from the grid wars.
