The authorities of the various institutions were aware of the great change in methods and customs of college life from that of the preparatory school, and hence they conceived the idea of a course in \"orientation\".

First, it is proposed to establish the school as a<br />\nmemorial to Walter Hines Page,<br />\nworld famous diplomat and author, former ambassador to England.
