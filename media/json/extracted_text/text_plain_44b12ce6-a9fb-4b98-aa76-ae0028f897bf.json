However, CAAS<br />\nmembers decided to \"table\" the<br />\nproposal for the present.<br />\nThe consensus of the members<br />\nwas that major problems with the<br />\nproposal in its present state could<br />\nbest be ironed out if decisive<br />\naction was delayed.<br />\nDifferences in opinion<br />\nconcerning the program centered<br />\nalong facul ty-student lines, with<br />\nmost of the !acuity members on<br />\nCAAS feeling that the program<br />\nshould be based on merit alone<br />\nwith equal sums of money<br />\ndispensed to each recipient.<br />\nStudent representatives, on the<br />\nother hand, wanted the proposed<br />\nprogram based on merit, but with<br />\nthe resulting stipend- awarded<br />\naccording to financial need.<br />\nGlen Thomas, Director of<br />\n<br />\nAdmission and a member of<br />\nCAAS, felt that \"Hopkins<br />\ndoesn't need to have the program<br />\nat this point.\" He stated though<br />\nthat there is \"some value in<br />\nhaving a merit scholarship<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\nHe based his argument on a<br />\nrecent speech by Tom<br />\nGoodwood, Headmaster of<br />\nHaverford School, which singles<br />\n<br />\nthan 200 student tickets for the<br />\nSunday concert have been sold.<br />\nHe stated that spectators at<br />\nthis semester's other concerts \u2014<br />\nmost notably those at the Robin<br />\nTrower concert \u2014 have done<br />\ncostly damage to the gym.

Since that<br />\ntime, however, the proposal has<br />\nnot been taken seriously here.<br />\nOwen believes that such a plan<br />\nis especially well suited to a<br />\nuniversity like Hopkins which is<br />\n<br />\nreleased, since he stated his office<br />\ndoes not have the time or the<br />\nmanpower to explain analysis<br />\nprocedure.<br />\n_<br />\nEric Rasmussen, student<br />\nassistant to the Homewood Vice<br />\nPresident and Larry Denton,<br />\nDirector of Academic Services,<br />\nwere more concerned with the<br />\ntwo other issues\u2014confidential<br />\nrecommendations and<br />\npsychologists' reports.<br />\n\"I think it is questionable<br />\nwhether these two categories<br />\nshould have been restricted by<br />\nthe guidelines.

Multiply us by ten.<br />\nCan you imagine what we would<br />\nbe like?\"<br />\nOwen considers the greatest<br />\nadvantage of a tuition-free<br />\nprogram to be the intellectual<br />\nfreedom which would result in<br />\nthe - .absence \u2022 of immediate<br />\nfinancial consideration's.<br />\nIn creating a tuition-free<br />\nuniversity of high academic<br />\nstandards, Owen would hope to<br />\nemphasize the creative aspects of<br />\nundergraduate education rather<br />\nthan professional considerations.<br />\nHe believes that such an<br />\norientation would not hamper<br />\nthe program's appeal. .<br />\n\"I have a feeling that there are<br />\nenough people attracted to the<br />\nidea.

Mondale stated that<br />\nVehicles (MIRV's) of 1300 per<br />\nprior to the Vladivostok<br />\nnation. (The U.S. now has 750,<br />\nagreement, \"neither side could<br />\nwhile the Soviet Union has<br />\nsanely contemplate a first strike<br />\nnone.)<br />\nbecause to do so would certainly<br />\nHowever, Mondale pointed out<br />\nbring about a retaliation which<br />\nthat certain technicalities of the<br />\nagreement allow \"both sides to<br />\n<br />\nwould destroy the attacker.<br />\nNow, however, \"Soviet MIRV<br />\ndeployment will make our fixed<br />\nland base ICBM force extremely<br />\nvulnerable to a first strike, thus<br />\nundermining strategic ability.\"<br />\nBesides the \"increased risks<br />\nand tensions\" which Mondale<br />\nfears will result from the<br />\nvulnerability of our missiles, he<br />\nforesees economic burdens. He<br />\nasserted that it \"will also provide<br />\nfurther justification for a wide<br />\nvariety of new strategic programs<br />\ncompensation,\" running in the<br />\ntens of billions.<br />\nAnother important point<br />\nwhich Mondale made was that<br />\nwhile the Vladivostok accord<br />\ndoes place certain numerical<br />\nlimits on arms, there is no<br />\nprovision made for the<br />\n\"qualitative arms race.\" \"The<br />\nonly limit is man's integrity,\"<br />\nMondale commented.<br />\nMondale set forth several<br />\nproposals which he felt could<br />\nserve to improve the arms<br />\nagreements, which he<br />\nsummarized as \"controls on<br />\ndeployment and testing,\" which<br />\n<br />\nIlitiqur (Taurrn<br />\nwith a bookshop in the front<br />\n<br />\nIT'S STILL NOT TOO LATE!<br />\n<br />\nSPEND THE SPRING IN<br />\n<br />\ntfratuibll<br />\n<br />\nPARIS or MADRID<br />\n<br />\n,A7S<br />\n<br />\nACADEMIC YEAR ABROAD<br />\n221 East 50th Street,<br />\nNew York, N.Y. 10022<br />\n212-752-2734<br />\nSemester \u2022 Year<br />\n\u2022Summer Programs<br />\n<br />\nwould \"put real teeth into the<br />\nlimitation on strategic arms<br />\nwithin the overall numbers<br />\nagreement reached pt<br />\nVladivostok.\"<br />\nIn concluding his talk.<br />\nMondale was rather assertive in<br />\nadvising a:at the President should<br />\n\"stay home\" and concentrate on<br />\ndomestic problems, stating the<br />\n\"weapons are important, but<br />\neven more crucial is the strength<br />\nof our economy,...our<br />\nrelationship with our allies, the<br />\nstrength of the international<br />\neconomy,...political institutions,<br />\nand our society.\"<br />\nA question and answer period<br />\nfollowed the Senator's lecture,<br />\nduring which the Mid-East, the<br />\nenergy crisis, and our present<br />\neconomic policy were a few of<br />\nthe topics discussed.

The wind is in from Africa...<br />\n<br />\nfor free<br />\nDean George Owen's notion of a tuition-free<br />\nundergtaduate program for Hopkins, officially proposed in<br />\n1972 and probably brewing in his intellect long before then,<br />\nhas never been accorded its share of serious consideration<br />\nhere. His reiteration of the idea seems especially appropriate<br />\nnow, as Academic Services administrators are caught in the<br />\nbind of desiring to enhance the appeal of a Hopkins<br />\neducation in the face of rising costs and diminished federal<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n,WOW<br />\n<br />\nassistance.<br />\nA tuition-free program would make Hopkins the only<br />\n<br />\nprivate university of its kind in the country, enhancing its<br />\nappeal more greatly than beefed up recruiting efforts merit<br />\nscholarships. The recent tuition hike here demonstrates how,<br />\nas Owen posits the situation, higher education is in the<br />\nprocess of \"pricing itself out\" of its own market. A novel<br />\napproach is called for, and Owen has proffered it.<br />\nOwen's hypothesis would call for the establishment of a<br />\nspecial $100 million endowment earmarked for the financing<br />\nof undergraduate education. The program thus produced<br />\nwould afford students an intellectual environment devoid of<br />\nmonetary concerns. It would, in addition, be a very appealing<br />\nprogram.<br />\nOwen dilated at length on the specifics of his idea in an<br />\narticle published in the Hopkins Magazine nearly two years<br />\nago. The tenets behind the idea of tuitionless education are<br />\nunusual and daring \u2014 to wit, that $100 million or an amount<br />\nclose to it could be raised, and that a University can maintain<br />\nits reputation without expansion of some form.<br />\nThe remarkable proposal has been granted little<br />\nconsideration, we suspect, because many have been dismayed<br />\nby its polemical structure. Though the idea of a $100 million<br />\nendowment may seem inconceivable at first glance, cogitate<br />\nfor a moment, ye skeptics \u2014 supposed we only managed to<br />\nraise $50 million?

Formal labor<br />\nnegotiations began on October 29<br />\nto arrive at a mutually agreeable<br />\ncontract by December 1, 1974, the<br />\nexpiration date of the current<br />\ncontract. There is some<br />\ninformation which I would like to<br />\noutline.<br />\nThe basic problem plaguing<br />\nthese negotiations is the impact of<br />\nthe union's wage and fringe benefit<br />\ndemands upon the operating costs<br />\nof the Hospital. Employee base<br />\npay and fringe benefit costs<br />\nrepresent about 70% of all Hospital<br />\ncosts. Consequently, any<br />\nadditional increases must be<br />\nquickly reflected in higher charges<br />\nto users of the Hospital's services<br />\nso that the financial stability of the<br />\nHospital can be guaranteed. In<br />\nfact, agreement with the union's<br />\nproposals could result in increases<br />\nof $50.00 a day in the daily rates<br />\nover the next two years.<br />\nIn addition to these formidable<br />\nunion pressures and their resulting<br />\npotential increase in operating<br />\ncosts of the Hospital, there are<br />\nequally strong pressures being<br />\nexerted in operating costs of the<br />\nHospital, there are equally strong<br />\npressures being exerted by<br />\ngovernment agencies to keep costs<br />\ndown. In 1971, the Maryland<br />\nlegislature created the Health<br />\nServices Cost Review Commission<br />\nwhich is responsible for monitoring<br />\nand approving increases in hospital<br />\nrates. The Medicare and Medicaid<br />\nprograms are placing further<br />\npressures on hospitals to keep rates<br />\nstable.<br />\nFrankly, these factors add up to<br />\nvery difficult negotiation. The<br />\nHospital's negotiating team has had<br />\nthree meetings with members of<br />\nthe union's negotiating team. All<br />\nhave been inconclusive. Our major<br />\nrole continues to be the care of the<br />\nsick. While fulfilling this<br />\nresponsibility, we cannot allow<br />\nanything to interfere with or<br />\nendanger the health of those<br />\nentrusted to us. On the one hand,<br />\nthere are union proposals which<br />\nindicate a significant impact on<br />\nHospital costs. On the other hand,<br />\nthere are government agencies such<br />\nas the Health Services Cost Review<br />\nCommission with the power to<br />\napprove or deny the Hospital rate<br />\nincreases that would be necessary<br />\nto pay for these added costs.<br />\nIn light of the union's economic<br />\nand management proposals,. the<br />\nrestrictive pressures of<br />\n<br />\nwillingness to serve as a member of<br />\nour manpower pool.<br />\nMay I urge you to take the<br />\nseveral minutes necessary to review<br />\nthe enclosed card, to complete the<br />\nrequested information, and to<br />\nreturn it to me through the<br />\ninteroffice mail system (no postage<br />\nnecessary)? -After I have received<br />\nyour completed card, a member of<br />\nmy staff will be in communication<br />\nwith you to confirm your<br />\nwillingness to help.

(You might ask.) Well, it's<br />\npretty much like in America: they<br />\nhave one. As we know, there is the<br />\ngovernment and the people, and<br />\nwhile all governments claim to act<br />\nin the interest of the people, few<br />\nreally do. I would have to say that<br />\nthe Ghanaian government is no<br />\nexception. The head of state is<br />\nColonel Kutu Acheampong, a<br />\nbenign (not a CIA run) military<br />\ndictator who is seldom<br />\nphotographed without his shades.<br />\nAnyway, his government is known<br />\nas the NRC (National Redemption<br />\nCouncil)\u2014(not to be confused with<br />\nthe NCR, National Cash Register<br />\nCo.). Col. Acheampong and his<br />\ngovernment claim bpisterously to<br />\nbe the people's savior. Basically<br />\nmost Ghanaians couldn't care less<br />\nwho's in power, because it just<br />\ndoesn't affect their daily lives. It's<br />\nalmost comical how the<br />\nstate-owned papers and radio<br />\nstations trump up patriotic support<br />\nfor the NRC. Every morning in<br />\nthree inch headlines Acheampong<br />\nis quoted as saying such prophetic<br />\nthings as \"ONLY HARD WORK<br />\nCAN SAVE US\" or \"WORKERS<br />\nWON'T BE CHEATED.\u201e Perhaps<br />\n<br />\ndifficult (=me'<br />\n.\"<br />\neverying that happens here is<br />\nweird. But consider the following<br />\n<br />\nitems as a small sampling of the<br />\nweird and wonderful magic of<br />\n<br />\nGhana. At 4 am on October 30th I<br />\nwas awakened by a thousand<br />\nAfricans chanting and singing<br />\n\"Ahhlee, Ahhlee, Ahhlee.\" It was<br />\nbeautiful. Or how about breast<br />\nfeeding on public transportation.<br />\nThat's beautiful, too.

(Ghanaianslike<br />\nmost third-world peoples get more<br />\nexcited about soccer than anything<br />\nelse.) And so it goes here, business<br />\nas usual.

This agreement<br />\nestablished a four year period during<br />\nwhich each group would execute certain<br />\nmeasures leading to Kurdish autonomy in<br />\n1974.

Bryan, a twisted and tormented<br />\nnative of Long Island, planned to show<br />\nhis deprived southern friend the wonders<br />\nof New York, the reality of \"the city.\"<br />\nGerry accepted the propaganda shot at<br />\nhim partly because he had never been<br />\nnorth of Baltimore, but more<br />\nimportantly, he wanted to believe those<br />\ntales he had heard of wandering<br />\ntroubadours and street poets, who<br />\nembraced strangers with their creativity.<br />\nHe wanted to walk down Fourth St. and<br />\nabsorb the sixties. Therefore, never<br />\nlooking back at the city which had<br />\nhoused them since September, they<br />\nhappily boarded a train to New York.<br />\nBryan couldn't be contained on the<br />\ntrip north. His eagerness to enlighten<br />\nGerry and sweep aside ugly rumors of<br />\nNew York was not to be dissipated.<br />\nBryan was fond of Baltimore in fact, it<br />\nwas fast becoming home to him, yet the<br />\nprospect of spending a few days in New<br />\nYork was refreshing, the relative<br />\nfamiliarity .with the city had not come<br />\neasily even after living in the<br />\nmetropolitan area his whole life. New<br />\nYork was his showcase, the most<br />\nimpressive piece of living he could show<br />\nhis slow-paced, but not easily impressed<br />\nfriend, who was unfortunate indeed to<br />\n,hail from what sociologists call a<br />\nperipheral/part of the union.\"<br />\n<br />\nHaving made plans to visit friends at<br />\nColumbia University, Bryan and Gerry<br />\nwere assured of a packed schedule, for at<br />\nColumbia, Gerry was told, one always has<br />\nsomething to do whether on or off<br />\ncampus. With these expectations evident<br />\nin their carefree dispositions, they arrived<br />\nat Penn Station, leaving Hopkins and<br />\nBaltimore in the past and future, ready to<br />\ntake an express subway uptown. But New<br />\nYork is not kind to those conditioned by<br />\nthe comparative emptiness and amiability<br />\nof Baltimore.<br />\nSomewhere. in the Lonely Crowd<br />\nLeaving Vile train, they were absorbed<br />\nin a rush hour panic, a solid mass of<br />\ncommuters and shoppers who were in to<br />\nmood to abort their frenzy in order to<br />\ngive directions to a couple of kids who<br />\nthey would never see again. Brushing<br />\nGerry's complaints aside, Bryan pushed<br />\nhis way downstairs to the subway, hopes<br />\nstill high. The novelty of Gerry's first<br />\nsubway ride evaporated quickly, as they<br />\nwere elbowed and shoved, drawn into the<br />\ntrain with mob momentum. He stopped<br />\nsaying \"excuse me\" after the first few<br />\nminutes, realizing that no one hears<br />\nanything in New York.<br />\nThey walked through the gates of<br />\ngrandiose Columbia University in the late<br />\nafternoon, it had been dark, it seemed,<br />\nfor hours. The frantic pace of these New<br />\nYorkers never stopped, students were<br />\nhustling their way to dinner, yelling<br />\nacross campus with no inhibition. It is the<br />\nway to live in New York. Meeting their<br />\nfriends, Bryan and Gerry were shown the<br />\n<br />\nsights of Columbia; a bar where beer was<br />\nstill only 5.75, roaches fit for boot<br />\nstamping, and Barnard College, object of<br />\npatronizing concern for those so highly<br />\nstationed at Columbia. After a night of<br />\nbeing asked about their major, GPA,a nd<br />\nhow many famous professors there are at<br />\n,Hopkins, Bryan and Gerry decided to<br />\nspend the next day downtown. Columbia<br />\nseemed a cold and ambitious university,<br />\nsurpassing Hopkins with ease.<br />\nOnly Sighin', Ma<br />\nBy this time, Bryan was at least<br />\nunsettled, while Gerry was too confused<br />\nto assess the city that he thought he<br />\nknew. But Gerry was still looking forward<br />\nto seeing the village, an area he had read<br />\nabout in books and folkie magazines. He<br />\nwas quickly disillusioned, walking down<br />\nMacDougal St., amidst garbage and bums,<br />\nasking for train fare. Gone were even the<br />\nsmall book stores and record shops that<br />\nBryan had been so enamored with just<br />\ntwo years ago. And of course there were<br />\nfew remnants of the middle sixties that<br />\nwere featured in Newsweek and<br />\nCrawdaddy.<br />\nQuickly, they decided to go to Wall<br />\nSt., an interesting diversity, part of New<br />\nYork that everyone should see. Walking<br />\nup from the subway to Chambers St.,<br />\nthey saw a huge crowd, yelling and<br />\nlaughing, a mob of people who were<br />\nprobably walking stone faced five<br />\nminutes earlier. An elderly man, swearing<br />\nin Spanish, was threatening to jump from<br />\nhis tenth story room. The crowd grew as<br />\nthe poke and firemen engineered a,<br />\n<br />\nrescue. Had Thomas Carlyle been present,<br />\nhe may have thought that he was witness<br />\nto a scene similar to the siege of the<br />\nBastille, in 1789. For this was surely a<br />\nmob, out for a stroll at noon. Gerry was<br />\nappalled at the crowd's levity, these were<br />\nthe first excited and smiling faces he had<br />\nseen in New York. After the man was<br />\napprehended by a policeman, the crowd<br />\ngave a final hurrah and hurried to their<br />\nnext appointment, faceless and speechless<br />\nas before.<br />\nBy now disgusted, Bryan and Gerry<br />\ntook the next train to tranquil Princeton,<br />\nwhere they would spend the remainder of<br />\nthe holiday with Bryan's family. Bryan's<br />\nopinion of New York had changed in the<br />\nfast few days they were there. Living in<br />\nBaltimore does that to people.<br />\nDown here in the Mounttins<br />\nHe realized that Baltimore, though one<br />\nof the nation's largest cities, is small<br />\nenough for a person to retain control,<br />\nsmall enough not to get lost. It had taken<br />\njust three months of living in Baltimore<br />\nto dispel] his glorificaiton of New York as<br />\nthe ideal city. Gerry was more disgusted<br />\nthan disheartened, he appreciated the<br />\nworld significance of New York, but was<br />\nnot anxious to return.<br />\nBryan and Gerry returned to Baltimore<br />\nin a happy frame of mind, not pleased<br />\nwith the prospect of term papers and<br />\nfinals crammed into two weeks, but glad<br />\nto be home. Coming back from New<br />\nYork City, they had enough. And enough<br />\nis enough.<br />\n<br />\nOpen a lemonade stand.<br />\nSell rice at weddings. Start a room cleaning service.

'University<br />\nexpansion..\"There,should be no<br />\ngrowth or expansion, and the<br />\nmoney raised in lieu of tuition<br />\ncosts should be put in banks and<br />\nallowed to earn capital.\"<br />\n\"I feel that universities such as<br />\nYale and Harvard that have<br />\nexorbitant tuition costs are<br />\npricing themselves out of the<br />\nmarket.

Multiply us by ten.<br />\nCan you imagine what we would<br />\nbe like?\"<br />\nOwen considers the greatest<br />\nadvantage of a tuition-free<br />\nprogram to be the intellectual<br />\nfreedom which would result in<br />\nthe - .absence \u2022 of immediate<br />\nfinancial consideration's.<br />\nIn creating a tuition-free<br />\nuniversity of high academic<br />\nstandards, Owen would hope to<br />\nemphasize the creative aspects of<br />\nundergraduate education rather<br />\nthan professional considerations.<br />\nHe believes that such an<br />\norientation would not hamper<br />\nthe program's appeal. .<br />\n\"I have a feeling that there are<br />\nenough people attracted to the<br />\nidea.

He<br />\nasserted that it \"will also provide<br />\nfurther justification for a wide<br />\nvariety of new strategic programs<br />\ncompensation,\" running in the<br />\ntens of billions.<br />\nAnother important point<br />\nwhich Mondale made was that<br />\nwhile the Vladivostok accord<br />\ndoes place certain numerical<br />\nlimits on arms, there is no<br />\nprovision made for the<br />\n\"qualitative arms race.\" \"The<br />\nonly limit is man's integrity,\"<br />\nMondale commented.<br />\nMondale set forth several<br />\nproposals which he felt could<br />\nserve to improve the arms<br />\nagreements, which he<br />\nsummarized as \"controls on<br />\ndeployment and testing,\" which<br /><br />\nIlitiqur (Taurrn<br />\nwith a bookshop in the front<br /><br />\nIT'S STILL NOT TOO LATE!<br /><br />\nSPEND THE SPRING IN<br /><br />\ntfratuibll<br /><br />\nPARIS or MADRID<br /><br />\n,A7S<br /><br />\nACADEMIC YEAR ABROAD<br />\n221 East 50th Street,<br />\nNew York, N.Y. 10022<br />\n212-752-2734<br />\nSemester \u2022 Year<br />\n\u2022Summer Programs<br /><br />\nwould \"put real teeth into the<br />\nlimitation on strategic arms<br />\nwithin the overall numbers<br />\nagreement reached pt<br />\nVladivostok.\"<br />\nIn concluding his talk.<br />\nMondale was rather assertive in<br />\nadvising a:at the President should<br />\n\"stay home\" and concentrate on<br />\ndomestic problems, stating the<br />\n\"weapons are important, but<br />\neven more crucial is the strength<br />\nof our economy,...our<br />\nrelationship with our allies, the<br />\nstrength of the international<br />\neconomy,...political institutions,<br />\nand our society.\"<br />\nA question and answer period<br />\nfollowed the Senator's lecture,<br />\nduring which the Mid-East, the<br />\nenergy crisis, and our present<br />\neconomic policy were a few of<br />\nthe topics discussed.

The wind is in from Africa...<br /><br />\nfor free<br />\nDean George Owen's notion of a tuition-free<br />\nundergtaduate program for Hopkins, officially proposed in<br />\n1972 and probably brewing in his intellect long before then,<br />\nhas never been accorded its share of serious consideration<br />\nhere. His reiteration of the idea seems especially appropriate<br />\nnow, as Academic Services administrators are caught in the<br />\nbind of desiring to enhance the appeal of a Hopkins<br />\neducation in the face of rising costs and diminished federal<br /><br />\n'<br />\n,WOW<br /><br />\nassistance.<br />\nA tuition-free program would make Hopkins the only<br /><br />\nprivate university of its kind in the country, enhancing its<br />\nappeal more greatly than beefed up recruiting efforts merit<br />\nscholarships. The recent tuition hike here demonstrates how,<br />\nas Owen posits the situation, higher education is in the<br />\nprocess of \"pricing itself out\" of its own market. A novel<br />\napproach is called for, and Owen has proffered it.<br />\nOwen's hypothesis would call for the establishment of a<br />\nspecial $100 million endowment earmarked for the financing<br />\nof undergraduate education. The program thus produced<br />\nwould afford students an intellectual environment devoid of<br />\nmonetary concerns. It would, in addition, be a very appealing<br />\nprogram.<br />\nOwen dilated at length on the specifics of his idea in an<br />\narticle published in the Hopkins Magazine nearly two years<br />\nago. The tenets behind the idea of tuitionless education are<br />\nunusual and daring \u2014 to wit, that $100 million or an amount<br />\nclose to it could be raised, and that a University can maintain<br />\nits reputation without expansion of some form.<br />\nThe remarkable proposal has been granted little<br />\nconsideration, we suspect, because many have been dismayed<br />\nby its polemical structure. Though the idea of a $100 million<br />\nendowment may seem inconceivable at first glance, cogitate<br />\nfor a moment, ye skeptics \u2014 supposed we only managed to<br />\nraise $50 million?

Formal labor<br />\nnegotiations began on October 29<br />\nto arrive at a mutually agreeable<br />\ncontract by December 1, 1974, the<br />\nexpiration date of the current<br />\ncontract. There is some<br />\ninformation which I would like to<br />\noutline.<br />\nThe basic problem plaguing<br />\nthese negotiations is the impact of<br />\nthe union's wage and fringe benefit<br />\ndemands upon the operating costs<br />\nof the Hospital. Employee base<br />\npay and fringe benefit costs<br />\nrepresent about 70% of all Hospital<br />\ncosts. Consequently, any<br />\nadditional increases must be<br />\nquickly reflected in higher charges<br />\nto users of the Hospital's services<br />\nso that the financial stability of the<br />\nHospital can be guaranteed. In<br />\nfact, agreement with the union's<br />\nproposals could result in increases<br />\nof $50.00 a day in the daily rates<br />\nover the next two years.<br />\nIn addition to these formidable<br />\nunion pressures and their resulting<br />\npotential increase in operating<br />\ncosts of the Hospital, there are<br />\nequally strong pressures being<br />\nexerted in operating costs of the<br />\nHospital, there are equally strong<br />\npressures being exerted by<br />\ngovernment agencies to keep costs<br />\ndown. In 1971, the Maryland<br />\nlegislature created the Health<br />\nServices Cost Review Commission<br />\nwhich is responsible for monitoring<br />\nand approving increases in hospital<br />\nrates. The Medicare and Medicaid<br />\nprograms are placing further<br />\npressures on hospitals to keep rates<br />\nstable.<br />\nFrankly, these factors add up to<br />\nvery difficult negotiation. The<br />\nHospital's negotiating team has had<br />\nthree meetings with members of<br />\nthe union's negotiating team. All<br />\nhave been inconclusive. Our major<br />\nrole continues to be the care of the<br />\nsick. While fulfilling this<br />\nresponsibility, we cannot allow<br />\nanything to interfere with or<br />\nendanger the health of those<br />\nentrusted to us. On the one hand,<br />\nthere are union proposals which<br />\nindicate a significant impact on<br />\nHospital costs. On the other hand,<br />\nthere are government agencies such<br />\nas the Health Services Cost Review<br />\nCommission with the power to<br />\napprove or deny the Hospital rate<br />\nincreases that would be necessary<br />\nto pay for these added costs.<br />\nIn light of the union's economic<br />\nand management proposals,. the<br />\nrestrictive pressures of<br /><br />\nwillingness to serve as a member of<br />\nour manpower pool.<br />\nMay I urge you to take the<br />\nseveral minutes necessary to review<br />\nthe enclosed card, to complete the<br />\nrequested information, and to<br />\nreturn it to me through the<br />\ninteroffice mail system (no postage<br />\nnecessary)? -After I have received<br />\nyour completed card, a member of<br />\nmy staff will be in communication<br />\nwith you to confirm your<br />\nwillingness to help.

Consequently,<br />\nthere will be flexible time<br />\nopportunities to offer assistance.<br />\nNo specific skills are necessary,just<br />\na willingness to help.<br />\nClearly, in the face of a strike,<br />\nthe Hospital is taking every<br />\nprecaution to prepare itself so that<br />\nit will have the capacity to<br />\ncontinue its operation.

(You might ask.) Well, it's<br />\npretty much like in America: they<br />\nhave one. As we know, there is the<br />\ngovernment and the people, and<br />\nwhile all governments claim to act<br />\nin the interest of the people, few<br />\nreally do. I would have to say that<br />\nthe Ghanaian government is no<br />\nexception. The head of state is<br />\nColonel Kutu Acheampong, a<br />\nbenign (not a CIA run) military<br />\ndictator who is seldom<br />\nphotographed without his shades.<br />\nAnyway, his government is known<br />\nas the NRC (National Redemption<br />\nCouncil)\u2014(not to be confused with<br />\nthe NCR, National Cash Register<br />\nCo.). Col. Acheampong and his<br />\ngovernment claim bpisterously to<br />\nbe the people's savior. Basically<br />\nmost Ghanaians couldn't care less<br />\nwho's in power, because it just<br />\ndoesn't affect their daily lives. It's<br />\nalmost comical how the<br />\nstate-owned papers and radio<br />\nstations trump up patriotic support<br />\nfor the NRC. Every morning in<br />\nthree inch headlines Acheampong<br />\nis quoted as saying such prophetic<br />\nthings as \"ONLY HARD WORK<br />\nCAN SAVE US\" or \"WORKERS<br />\nWON'T BE CHEATED.\u201e Perhaps<br /><br />\ndifficult (=me'<br />\n.\"<br />\neverying that happens here is<br />\nweird. But consider the following<br /><br />\nitems as a small sampling of the<br />\nweird and wonderful magic of<br /><br />\nGhana. At 4 am on October 30th I<br />\nwas awakened by a thousand<br />\nAfricans chanting and singing<br />\n\"Ahhlee, Ahhlee, Ahhlee.\" It was<br />\nbeautiful.

Lazzaro<br />\nOpened quickly with a takedown<br />\nand had Collins on this back<br />\nbefore the end of the period.<br />\nWith a 5-0 lead after the first<br />\nperiod, Lazzaro put his man on<br />\nhis back at the beginning of<br />\nPeriod number 2 finishing him<br />\noff with a pin at the 2:20 mark.<br />\nThis is what Gotwals hopes<br />\nLazzaro will do for the Jays, start<br />\nthe team scoring off with a fall.<br />\nAt 126 pounds, Ron Pucillo<br />\nbattled scoreless with Paco<br />\nMarshall in the first period but<br />\nput Marshall in jeopardy twice<br />\nwith near falls in the second<br />\nperiod. Pucillo held on the his<br />\n4-0 lead in the final period and<br />\ngained a decision for the Jays.<br />\nThe next victor for the Jays<br />\nwas Mike Privitera at 134<br />\nPounds. Although Privitera was<br />\ntaken down by his challenger<br />\nDave Newby. Privitera quickly<br /><br />\nreversed Newby and went on to<br />\nturn him over for 3 more points.<br />\nAfter a scoreless second period,<br />\nPrivitera pinned his man after 5<br />\nminutes and six seconds.<br />\nClark Kingery settled down<br />\nafter a loose opening period to<br />\nsend Rich Burke to the showers<br />\nwith a pin in 3:45 in the 142<br />\npound bout.<br />\nNewcomer Andy Rindow had<br />\nhis hands full with captain K.C.<br />\nDine and was set back by the<br />\nscore of 8-2, the first of only two,<br />\nBluejay defeats. Rindow wrestled<br />\nat 150 pounds.<br />\nComing off a lung injury,<br />\nsenior Robert Fink showed he<br />\nwas back in shape with a quick<br />\n1:59 pin over Steve Dodd at 158<br />\npounds.<br />\nThe only other Hopkins defeat<br />\ncame at 167 pounds as Bill<br />\nBirmingham could not overcome<br />\nPete Takach of Washington<br />\nCollege. Birmingham was<br />\ndefeated 6-1.<br />\nAnother newcomer to the<br />\nwresting scheme for the Bluejays,<br />\nRobin Hiscock, in this first<br />\nintercollegiate match, tore up<br />\nTom Layton by the score of<br />\n12-1.<br />\nGary Murza won his match by<br />\nforfeit but wrestled an exhibition<br />\nmatch in which he pinned his<br />\nman.<br />\nFinishing off the scoring for<br />\nHopkins was Lou Wolfin at HWT'<br />\nWolfin, also in his first<br />\nintercollegiate bout, started off<br />\nhis career on a solid note pinning<br />\nRay Whitaker in 2:13.<br />\nLa zzaro started of the<br />\nGalludet match as he had begun<br />\nthe first. Lazzaro pinned Bill<br />\nThompson in 2:21. Ron Pucillo<br />\nwon his match by forfeit.<br />\nInstead of leaving Privitera in<br />\nthe lineup, Gotwals allowed<br />\nanother man to get some<br />\nexperience and substituted Tom<br /><br />\nLocraft for \u2014rivitera. Locraft did<br />\nan excellent job pinning Danny<br />\nGardner in 5:54. Locraft is<br />\nanother of Gotwal's newcomers<br />\nto the wrestling scene this<br />\nyear. Clark Kingery grabbed his<br />\nsecond pin of the day over Frank<br />\nPlummer. This time the fall came<br />\nin 3:22.<br />\nAt 150 .pounds, Andy Rindos<br />\nmet the same fate he had in his<br />\nopening match losing a decision<br />\nto Dave Sanderson by the- score<br />\nof 10-4. Despite his two losses<br />\nfor the day, Gotwals feels that<br />\nRindos will improve this season<br /><br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nA boon to Washington and a<br />\nplague to Baltimore<br />\nThat seems to be the effect of<br />\nthe recently constructed Capital<br />\nCentre arena. The constant<br />\ncomplaints around Baltimore<br />\nconcerning the dearth of such<br />\nactivities as big-name concerts<br />\nand professional sporting events<br />\ncan be traced to the<br />\nestablishment of the Largo arena.<br />\nThough ultimately, of course,<br />\nthe evacuation of our heavenly<br />\ncity by the Bullets and big-name<br />\nrock groups, can be traced to the<br />\napathetic nature of the native<br />\nBaltimorean, a characterisitc<br />\nwhich has proven to be<br />\ncontagious, spreading to the<br />\ncity's few remaining attractions,<br />\nnamely the Orioles, the Colts,<br />\nand the Clippers!

The drawback<br />\nhere is that there is no mode of<br />\npublic transportation travelling<br />\nfrom Baltimore to the arena in<br />\nLargo, Maryland. It seems that<br />\nMr. Pollin was intent on not<br />\nsimply separating his marriage<br />\nwith the city of Baltimore but<br />\ngetting a complete divorce,<br />\ndepending entirely on<br />\nWashington and it's suburbs for<br />\n.support. This plan has been<br />\nsuccessful and the annullment<br />\nwas made final with the changing<br />\nof the Bullets' surname from<br />\nCapital (which was originally<br />\ndesigned to envelope the<br />\nBaltimore-Washington and not<br />\nalienate either area) to the<br />\nWashington Bullets, severing all<br />\nties with Bawlamer. \u2022<br />\nIf one can ignore the feeling<br />\nthat Pain has turned his back on<br />\n\"the city that made him\", one<br />\ncan objectively realize that the<br />\nCapital Centre is one of the most<br />\nsuccessful arenas of its type in<br />\nthe country.<br />\nThe Capital Centre opened on<br />\nSunday, December2, 1973,<br />\nfifteen months after<br />\ngroundbreaking.

CARTER<br />\nOn Thursday, November 14, The<br />\nYouth Institute for Peace in the Middle<br />\nEast hosted Mr. Mohammed Said Dosky,<br />\nU.S. Representative of the Kurdistan<br />\nDemocratic Party, at what became an<br />\nexplosive and emotional session. The<br />\ndiscussion topic was, \"The Other War in<br />\nthe Middle East: The Kurds and Iraq.\"<br />\nThe audience reaction varied. Questions<br />\nof, \"Who is Iraqi? Who is Kurdish? Is<br />\nthere civil war and why?\" led one person<br />\nto say that she was,\" appalled by the<br />\nracism around her.\" One Iraqi accused<br />\nthe discussion of being repressive. He felt<br />\nthat questions had been assigned and that<br />\nhe was, not being given enough<br />\nopportunity for expression.<br />\nAt this point one may ask what is<br />\ngoing on. Who are the Kurds and why are<br />\nso ilany feathers ruffled?The Kurds are<br /><br />\nthe fourth largest minority in the Middle<br />\nEast and have traditionally inhabited the<br />\narea which is now North Iraq North West<br />\nIran, South East Turkey, North East<br />\nSyria, and South West U.S.S.R. In the<br />\nearly twentieth century a Kurdish state<br />\nwas to have been established in this area<br />\nunder the League of Nation's article of<br />\nnational self determination, but it was<br />\nnot put into effect to the \"international<br />\ncomplications and foreign self interest.According to Mr. Dosky, the hostilities<br />\ntoday are rooted in the Iraqi<br />\ngovernment's refusal to honor an<br />\nagreement made between themselves and<br />\nthe Kurds in 1970. This agreement<br />\nestablished a four year period during<br />\nwhich each group would execute certain<br />\nmeasures leading to Kurdish autonomy in<br />\n1974.

Finally, Kurds would be<br />\nguaranteed public office on all levels of<br />\nIraqi government in proportion to their<br />\npopulation.<br />\nThese plans did not materialize<br />\nthrough the joint effort of the Iraqi and<br />\nSoviet governments. There is official<br />\ndiscrimination against Kurds in all areas<br />\nas well as efforts to replace indegenous<br />\nKurds and Arabs in the oil rich districts.<br />\nThe National Assembly never convened<br />\nand Kurds are denied executive powers in<br />\ntheir own areas. The Soviet role in the<br />\nstruggle is to provide arms and technical<br />\nassistance to the Iraqi government in<br /><br />\nexchange for use of a naval base,<br />\nCommunisty Party participation in the<br />\ncentral government, a consistent oils<br />\nsupply at three dollars a barrel, and<br />\ntwenty years friendship.<br />\nMr. Dosky ended his speech by<br />\nreiterating the plea that all national<br />\nliberation groups be heard in the U.N.<br />\nand that the U.N. extend the same<br />\ncensure given South Africa to all nations<br />\nthat discriminate against a portion of<br />\ntheir population.<br />\nOne can only expect a speaker to<br />\npresent the facts as he or she sees them;<br />\nto expect more is to be continuously<br />\ndisappointed; to expect less is to ask for<br />\ninsincerity.

Bryan, a twisted and tormented<br />\nnative of Long Island, planned to show<br />\nhis deprived southern friend the wonders<br />\nof New York, the reality of \"the city.\"<br />\nGerry accepted the propaganda shot at<br />\nhim partly because he had never been<br />\nnorth of Baltimore, but more<br />\nimportantly, he wanted to believe those<br />\ntales he had heard of wandering<br />\ntroubadours and street poets, who<br />\nembraced strangers with their creativity.<br />\nHe wanted to walk down Fourth St. and<br />\nabsorb the sixties. Therefore, never<br />\nlooking back at the city which had<br />\nhoused them since September, they<br />\nhappily boarded a train to New York.<br />\nBryan couldn't be contained on the<br />\ntrip north. His eagerness to enlighten<br />\nGerry and sweep aside ugly rumors of<br />\nNew York was not to be dissipated.<br />\nBryan was fond of Baltimore in fact, it<br />\nwas fast becoming home to him, yet the<br />\nprospect of spending a few days in New<br />\nYork was refreshing, the relative<br />\nfamiliarity .with the city had not come<br />\neasily even after living in the<br />\nmetropolitan area his whole life. New<br />\nYork was his showcase, the most<br />\nimpressive piece of living he could show<br />\nhis slow-paced, but not easily impressed<br />\nfriend, who was unfortunate indeed to<br />\n,hail from what sociologists call a<br />\nperipheral/part of the union.\"<br /><br />\nHaving made plans to visit friends at<br />\nColumbia University, Bryan and Gerry<br />\nwere assured of a packed schedule, for at<br />\nColumbia, Gerry was told, one always has<br />\nsomething to do whether on or off<br />\ncampus. With these expectations evident<br />\nin their carefree dispositions, they arrived<br />\nat Penn Station, leaving Hopkins and<br />\nBaltimore in the past and future, ready to<br />\ntake an express subway uptown. But New<br />\nYork is not kind to those conditioned by<br />\nthe comparative emptiness and amiability<br />\nof Baltimore.<br />\nSomewhere. in the Lonely Crowd<br />\nLeaving Vile train, they were absorbed<br />\nin a rush hour panic, a solid mass of<br />\ncommuters and shoppers who were in to<br />\nmood to abort their frenzy in order to<br />\ngive directions to a couple of kids who<br />\nthey would never see again. Brushing<br />\nGerry's complaints aside, Bryan pushed<br />\nhis way downstairs to the subway, hopes<br />\nstill high. The novelty of Gerry's first<br />\nsubway ride evaporated quickly, as they<br />\nwere elbowed and shoved, drawn into the<br />\ntrain with mob momentum. He stopped<br />\nsaying \"excuse me\" after the first few<br />\nminutes, realizing that no one hears<br />\nanything in New York.<br />\nThey walked through the gates of<br />\ngrandiose Columbia University in the late<br />\nafternoon, it had been dark, it seemed,<br />\nfor hours. The frantic pace of these New<br />\nYorkers never stopped, students were<br />\nhustling their way to dinner, yelling<br />\nacross campus with no inhibition. It is the<br />\nway to live in New York. Meeting their<br />\nfriends, Bryan and Gerry were shown the<br /><br />\nsights of Columbia; a bar where beer was<br />\nstill only 5.75, roaches fit for boot<br />\nstamping, and Barnard College, object of<br />\npatronizing concern for those so highly<br />\nstationed at Columbia. After a night of<br />\nbeing asked about their major, GPA,a nd<br />\nhow many famous professors there are at<br />\n,Hopkins, Bryan and Gerry decided to<br />\nspend the next day downtown. Columbia<br />\nseemed a cold and ambitious university,<br />\nsurpassing Hopkins with ease.<br />\nOnly Sighin', Ma<br />\nBy this time, Bryan was at least<br />\nunsettled, while Gerry was too confused<br />\nto assess the city that he thought he<br />\nknew. But Gerry was still looking forward<br />\nto seeing the village, an area he had read<br />\nabout in books and folkie magazines. He<br />\nwas quickly disillusioned, walking down<br />\nMacDougal St., amidst garbage and bums,<br />\nasking for train fare. Gone were even the<br />\nsmall book stores and record shops that<br />\nBryan had been so enamored with just<br />\ntwo years ago. And of course there were<br />\nfew remnants of the middle sixties that<br />\nwere featured in Newsweek and<br />\nCrawdaddy.<br />\nQuickly, they decided to go to Wall<br />\nSt., an interesting diversity, part of New<br />\nYork that everyone should see. Walking<br />\nup from the subway to Chambers St.,<br />\nthey saw a huge crowd, yelling and<br />\nlaughing, a mob of people who were<br />\nprobably walking stone faced five<br />\nminutes earlier. An elderly man, swearing<br />\nin Spanish, was threatening to jump from<br />\nhis tenth story room. The crowd grew as<br />\nthe poke and firemen engineered a,<br /><br />\nrescue. Had Thomas Carlyle been present,<br />\nhe may have thought that he was witness<br />\nto a scene similar to the siege of the<br />\nBastille, in 1789. For this was surely a<br />\nmob, out for a stroll at noon. Gerry was<br />\nappalled at the crowd's levity, these were<br />\nthe first excited and smiling faces he had<br />\nseen in New York. After the man was<br />\napprehended by a policeman, the crowd<br />\ngave a final hurrah and hurried to their<br />\nnext appointment, faceless and speechless<br />\nas before.<br />\nBy now disgusted, Bryan and Gerry<br />\ntook the next train to tranquil Princeton,<br />\nwhere they would spend the remainder of<br />\nthe holiday with Bryan's family. Bryan's<br />\nopinion of New York had changed in the<br />\nfast few days they were there. Living in<br />\nBaltimore does that to people.<br />\nDown here in the Mounttins<br />\nHe realized that Baltimore, though one<br />\nof the nation's largest cities, is small<br />\nenough for a person to retain control,<br />\nsmall enough not to get lost. It had taken<br />\njust three months of living in Baltimore<br />\nto dispel] his glorificaiton of New York as<br />\nthe ideal city. Gerry was more disgusted<br />\nthan disheartened, he appreciated the<br />\nworld significance of New York, but was<br />\nnot anxious to return.<br />\nBryan and Gerry returned to Baltimore<br />\nin a happy frame of mind, not pleased<br />\nwith the prospect of term papers and<br />\nfinals crammed into two weeks, but glad<br />\nto be home. Coming back from New<br />\nYork City, they had enough. And enough<br />\nis enough.<br /><br />\nOpen a lemonade stand.<br />\nSell rice at weddings. Start a room cleaning service.
