As he recently explained,\"The eye has millions<br />\nof nerve fibers all doing different things<br />\nat the same time.

Toll<br />\n<br />\nFink You<br />\nBackscratchers, hacks, and finks infest the Student Council - a<br />\nself proclaimed liaison\" between the students and the administration. We submit that the Student Council is neither \"laison\" nor<br />\nvoice for the students, but an able and willing tool of the administration.<br />\nThe duly elected members of this apolitical body wish only that<br />\nthe boat be not rocked for fear that their graduate recommendations would be marred. At meetings they table a controversial resolution on dormitory conditions without discussion and go on to<br />\nspend 45 minutes hearing a report from a now defunct vandalism<br />\ncommittee. They spend three weeks on the question of a dress code<br />\nin the library while several score of their fellow students are being<br />\nrobbed blind by the Plant Manager's Office.<br />\nThe first great myth that they subscribe to is that they represent<br />\nthe students. They do not represent graduate students, they do not<br />\nrepresent a majority of the undergraduates who study here. They represent a few of their immediate friends who are often the only ones<br />\naware of their existence. It is not a political structure, but a social<br />\nclub. Not a viable organization,but a Mickey Mouse debating society.<br />\nThe second great myth that the Student Council members delude<br />\nthemselves with is that they do something. This year they sent off<br />\na self-righteious letter protesting the health insurance fraud, and have<br />\nsince then spent several weeks arguing over choice of lecture speakers. This is certainly quite an admirable record of achievement.<br />\nThe Council has potential to be an active source of innovation, a<br />\nprotector of student rights, and an enrichment to the college career.<br />\nIt has chosen to be the last haven for selfish, Ivory Tower administration servants. A great part of the game rests with the leader and<br />\nhis spineless, and often mindless, underlings. And part of the blame<br />\nlies with the students who allow such a demeaning charade to go on.<br />\nThere are several alternatives. One can change the Council's outlook immediately, or one can set up a separate student government<br />\nthat will be responsible only to students, that will act with vigor, and<br />\nthat will eventually create changes to further student interests.<br />\nThe Council's interests at the moment do not coincide with the<br />\nstudents' interest. Unless this situation is remedied, the Student<br />\nCouncil may find itself without a mandate.<br />\nStudent Power is a reality, and until these junior establishment<br />\ntypes realize this and move to eradicate infringements on students'<br />\nrights, we will suffer.<br />\nAt this time the Student Council is without support, without<br />\nbrains, without leadership, and is representative in myth only. The<br />\nStudent Council is nothing, and it should be treated as such.<br />\n<br />\nIn Retrospect<br />\nThere are many lingering emotions which we who went on Saturday's march now feel, but most pressing of any are the feelings of<br />\ndespair and frustration.<br />\nMany despaired that violence had occured in what was hoped to<br />\nhave been a peaceful demonstration, others that not enough violence<br />\nhad occured and that the violence which did erupt was spurred more<br />\nby the U.S. marshals than by the demonstrators. But whatever the<br />\nfeelings, everyone who is concerned over our involvement in the<br />\nVietnam war had to be frustrated as the weekend closed. Not only<br />\ndid the press corps report the rally, march and demonstration in a<br />\nbiased, if not untrue, manner (as everyone there will agree); but it is<br />\nnow evident that despite the presence of well over 100,000 dissenters<br />\nin the nation's capitol, nothing will change.<br />\nSaturday was a beautiful day, and the rally at the Lincoln Memorial was even more beautiful. But as the day progressed, as the<br />\nspeeches became more obtuse, and as more busses arrived, no one<br />\ncould escape the thought of how much his presence was in vain.<br />\nThis is why violence erupted; this is why people opposed to and<br />\nafraid of violence stayed at the Pentagon all night. This is also why<br />\nRussia was soaked in bloodbath in 1917 and Algeria in 1960. Frustration is a dangerous thing, the enemy of an insensitive government.<br />\n<br />\nGerms Revisited<br />\nWe are pleased to note that the Academic Council is about to review the secret research contract policy at Hopkins.<br />\nWe hope the Council will recognize the contradiction involved in<br />\nsecret research conducted at a free private university - and the campus unrest that follow.Perhaps the solution can be something along<br />\nthe lines of the current University of Pennsylvania policy to accept<br />\nonly research that can be freely published.<br />\nThe Academic Council is now in a position whereby it can further<br />\nfree thought at Hopkins and open new paths of innovation and progress previously lacking. We hope they will not ignore the opportunity.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,OCTOBER 27,1967<br />\n<br />\nI don't know how to tell you this<br />\nwithout sounding like a crazy man or a<br />\nliar, and I don't want to frighten, or<br />\ndissillusion, or even titillate you but<br />\nthere was a massacre at the Pentagon<br />\nSaturday night. And I don't want to be<br />\nthe one to break what must be the<br />\nbest-kept secret in the world, but at the<br />\nPentagon Saturday night, a group of<br />\npeaceful, sitting-down demonstrators<br />\nwas beaten and beaten by United States Marshalls MP's and an outfit called<br />\nthe 82nd Airborne, (called by the papers, \"Detroit-hardened vets.\") I saw<br />\nthem use tear-gas and I saw them needlessly brutalize everyone they got their<br />\nhands on, but I hesitate even to bring<br />\nup such distasteful matters as the warm<br />\nand jovial dinner table that is America.<br />\nHow are you going to believe me, when<br />\nnot a single newspaper, and not a single<br />\ntelevision station, has even approximated accuracy in reporting what went on<br />\nat the Pentagon?<br />\nI was going to write an article on the<br />\nreasons for the Federal brutality. I was<br />\ngoing to consider for you the political<br />\nstrategy behind the Federal brutality,<br />\nand what it portends for the future, but<br />\nwhen I got back to Baltimore, Sunday<br />\nnight, I found out nobody even knows<br />\nthere was brutality. I've read the papapers -the Baltimore Sun, the Washington Post and Star, and the New York<br />\nTimes - - and they are lying, are bulling<br />\nit up. For what it's worth then, against<br />\nthe superstructure of falsehood in the<br />\npublic press, I'd like to tell you what<br />\nhappened at the Pentagon, on the tail<br />\nend of that foolish Peach March, from<br />\nearly evening until 4:30 Sunday morning, when I had to leave because I<br />\ncouldn't take any more. I'm sorry that<br />\nI degenerate into abrasive screeching<br />\nnow and then, but I have to be believable in the face of that glazed and<br />\nglassy reportage in the Times and its<br />\ncronies, of those absolute lies that seem<br />\nabsolutely true only because they are<br />\nwritten so calmly, with the self-assurance of the tablets of the law.<br />\nFirst of all, the Peace March reached<br />\nthe Pentagon lawn and flowed right up<br />\nonto the Pentagon steps. At about 5<br />\no'clock, kids wearing the blue arm<br />\nbands of the Mobilization, told everyone on the steps that there was every<br />\npossibility of arrest. They said if you<br />\ndon't Want to get arrested, go away.<br />\nThey said, explicitly, directly, if you<br />\ndon't go away, you'll be sorry. All but<br />\nabout 2,000 went away. I stayed because the march itself had been so unsatisfactory. It was a group therapy<br />\nsession for people who wished to \"register the protest\" with themselves and<br />\ntheir pals. It was an easy method for us<br />\nall to categorize ourselves to ourselves<br />\nas the Good People. In gaudiness and<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\ninessentiality it was rivaled only by occasional Easter Parades and cattle drives. I was, frankly, ashamed to have<br />\nstepped so lively in a thing like that.<br />\nWhat was planned for the Pentagon was<br />\na vigil, to last until Sunday midnight.<br />\nThose who stayed for the vigil felt it<br />\nwould purge them ofthe march. An arguabh point. I stayed. We were told<br />\nthat the Nip's could decide to push<br />\nthrough the crowd and arrest us all if<br />\nsomeone at the front of the crowd did<br />\nsomething illegal- - try to break through<br />\nthe wall of soldiers and punch the Pentagon or something. This, for those who<br />\nare interested, is known as the Domino<br />\nTheory of Arrest.<br />\nNext was a small action on the steps<br />\nin which a group of MPs and Marshalls<br />\nattempting to chase us back onto the<br />\nlawn was itself chased into a small corner near a wall. We giggled at the foollishness of their situation and two Marshalls beat a young man to insensibility<br />\nin reply. Later I was told that two MPs<br />\nwere trapped and beaten by the crowd,<br />\nbut I didn't see any of that. The only<br />\nother major incident of the afternoon<br />\nwas when 50-100 radical clowns made a<br />\nrush through the soldiers toward the<br />\nPentagon building. I understand four<br />\ngot inside, but I can't see how. It seems<br />\nreasonable that if the Government<br />\nwould transport 60,000 troops to the<br />\nbuilding they would also close the<br />\ndoor. In any case, they were all arrested and taken away in a van. The press,<br />\nin reporting the entire vigil, seems to<br />\nimply that the only civilians hurt were<br />\nthose who rushed for the Pentagon.<br />\nNot true. They were not hurt at all- because it was still daylight - - only arrested (except for a couple of guys who<br />\nwere tripped up) and carted away. The<br />\nreal hurting started after most of the<br />\npress was gone, and the middle-age<br />\npeople, and doctors, and professors,<br />\nand Norman Mailer. The real hurting<br />\nenjoyed both the hours and the privacy<br />\nof a bedroom perversion.<br />\nWhat formed in the afternoon was a<br />\nstraight line of demarcation with MPs<br />\non one side and demonstrators on the<br />\nother, with an inch or two between the<br />\ntwo groups. The demonstrators sang<br />\nvarious rouser songs, patriotic songs,<br />\ncivil rights songs, and a couple of hundred burned their draft cards, each one<br />\nholding it up for the crowd to see and<br />\napplaud. Sonic put flowers in the soldiers' guns. Some told the soldiers they<br />\nwere people, too, and should put down<br />\ntheir guns and join us. (As a matter of<br />\nfact, two of them did join us. This is<br />\nnot a rumor, It happened, and one was<br />\narrested immediately by the Marshal's<br />\nwhile the other made it into our crowd.<br />\nbelieve he was arrested later. This<br />\nsmall victory was announced over the<br />\n<br />\nmegaphones and caused us all to plead<br />\nin ernest with the soldiers. We sang the<br />\nStar Spangled Banner and This Land is<br />\nYour Land, to them, and gave them<br />\nprune juice and Ethos. I, too, tried desperately to convince some MPs of their<br />\nhumanity and good nature, but as it got<br />\ndarker and their rifle butt hammerings<br />\non our front line became more and<br />\nmore frequent, they began looking<br />\nmore and more like a line of new General Motors cars.) After the initial rush,<br />\nno demonstrators did anything at all to<br />\ncross the established line of demarcation. What we wanted - - all we wanted<br />\nwas to be there all night.<br />\nBut soon after dark, the troops advanced. It's my feeling that they decided it would be a loss of face for the<br />\nmilitary if all 2,000 of us maintained<br />\nour vigil until morning. There was no<br />\nannouncement from the troops to this<br />\neffect, but then there were at no point<br />\ncommunications from them to us. After dark they started to pick people<br />\noff the front line. They chose one, hit<br />\nhim in the back with a billy club - - not<br />\ntoo hard, just enough to bruise - - and<br />\nthen, if he turned around or tried to<br />\ngrab at the club, they lammed into him<br />\nin earnest. Then dragged him off to the<br />\npaddy wagon. The rest of the crowd<br />\nstayed seated, arms linked, with their<br />\nheads down to protect them from clubs.<br />\nAt first the points of conflict seemed<br />\nrandom. They seemed to be the results of either disorderly conduct on the<br />\npart of the individual demonstrator or<br />\noverzealousness on the part of the Marshall. Our leaders at the megaphones<br />\nkept telling us not to taunt the MPsand<br />\nthey will leave you alone. They are people, too, man! But that was a mistake,<br />\nstrategically if not generically, because<br />\naround 10:30 it became obvious the<br />\narrests occurred at precise intervals of,<br />\nsay, twenty feet, all up and down the<br />\nline. With each arrest. an MP would<br />\nmove into the vacancy, so the line went<br />\nfrom straight to scalloped. The idea was<br />\nto force wedges into our tight crowd<br />\nand then to isolate and surround small<br />\nparcels of us.<br />\nBy 11:30 their advance was well<br />\nunderway. I must tell you again that we<br />\noffered none but the most passive of<br />\nresistance, on account of there were<br />\ntwenty rows of troops, each row fifty<br />\nmen or so in length, stretching from<br />\nour lines right up the the Pentagon door<br />\nIt was obvious that in a violent action,<br />\nthey held the edge. We sat. That's all.<br />\nAnd screamed to the television cameras<br />\nto turn on their floodlights, because<br />\nwhen the floodlights were on, and the<br />\ncameras taking it all in the Marshalls<br />\nceased the more cavalier aspects of<br />\n(Continued to page 9)<br />\n<br />\nRepublican Bias<br />\n<br />\nPercy:Pushing His Luck?<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nBY KENNETH W. BOND<br />\nEditors' note: This week our tale<br />\nunfolds to find the errant knight Percy<br />\nonce again chasing the fire-breathing<br />\ndonkey.Part four of a series.<br />\nThe 1968 Republican Stage Review<br />\ncurrently features George Romney,<br />\nDick Nixon, and Ronald Reagan in the<br />\nspotlight. But if these three should receive too many eggs and rotten tomatoes from the audience, then what? Is<br />\nthere another act available?'Yes: Senator Charles Percy from Illinois.<br />\nThe recent speculation in Percy as a<br />\nGOP presidential candidate has come<br />\nmainly from those party moderates and<br />\nliberals who arc becoming panicky<br />\nabout the swift rise of Ronpld Reagan.<br />\nAs Big George rides brainwashed into<br />\nthe sunset, the only man who could prevent another conservative takeover in<br />\nMiami Beach is Percy, that is, assuming<br />\nNelson Rockefeller has outed out completely. Hence, Charles Percy is the<br />\nfallback man: Mr. Available.<br />\nPercy<br />\nhas numerous qualities<br />\nwhich make him a supurb man for the<br />\nGOP nomination. At forty-eight, Percy<br />\nis the American dream come true. Born<br />\nin Chicago slums, Percy worked his way<br />\nup as bus-boy to become president of<br />\nBell and Howell at age twenty-nine, and<br />\na millionaire at thirty-five. When he got<br />\na little bored with business, he tried<br />\nhis hand at politics losing the Illinois<br />\n<br />\ngovernorship in 1964 due to his public<br />\nendorsement of Barry Goldwater. But<br />\nglamour and youth aren't all that Percy<br />\nhas to offer. Unlike Reagan who is often charged with hiding a glittering facade behind his glittering facade, Percy<br />\nis respected for his brains and innovative abilities. His home-ownership for<br />\nslum clearance bill, and his All-Asian<br />\nPeace Conference proposal have wide<br />\nappeal to GOP progressives. To many<br />\nRepublicans, Percy is the party's Jack<br />\nKennedy, finally Percy's rapport with<br />\nGoldwater in 1964, plus his pragmatic<br />\napproach to issues make him the foremost compromise candidate after Nixon. Both the liberal Eastern establishment and western neo-conscrvatives<br />\ncould pallatc him.<br />\nHowever, Percy has some almost insurmountable obstacles to conquer if he<br />\nis really ambitious for the 1968 nomination. First, to be the fallback candidate, Romney would have to relinquish the ground he now holds. But<br />\nchances are he won't. even if the roof<br />\ncaves in.

It has failed to move<br />\nsignificantly into the areas of student<br />\nrights, participation in major decisions<br />\nand social involvement. It has also failed<br />\nto challenge Administration policy in<br />\ncrucial areas.<br />\nLast November, a controversy arose<br />\non campus when a local barber refused<br />\nto serve a Negro Hopkins student. The<br />\ncontroversy was first publicly aired by<br />\nsmall activist groups on campus. Subsequently, the Newsletter publicized the<br />\n<br />\nThe City-State of Homewood<br />\nby JAMES WULACH<br />\nThe characteristic Hopkins apathy<br />\nand non-involvement is so ingrained, it<br />\nhas become a cliche. The fault partially<br />\nrests within human nature, but the fact<br />\nthat other campuses are much more<br />\nalive, aware and involved suggests that<br />\nour system, particularly epitomized by<br />\nour Student Council, is to blame. This<br />\nis what the idea of an Athenian Democracy at the Hopkins hopes to change.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is deliberately small<br />\nin enrollment - because, as University<br />\npropaganda proclaims, it combines the<br />\nscholarly advantages of a university with<br />\nthe closeness of a community. From experience, the Hopkins student knows<br />\nthat this is merely propaganda. However, Hopkins smallness l'acilitates the<br />\nidea of Athenian Democracy as a replacement for Student Council.<br />\n\"Direct Participation\"<br />\nLike the Athenian system, or the<br />\nfamed town-hall meetings of early New<br />\nEngland, the smallness of our student<br />\nbody easily can allow every person direct participation and voting in student<br />\ngovernment decisions. At first, such a<br />\nsimple plan may be shrugged off as<br />\nUtopian nonsense, but here is what it<br />\nwill do:<br />\nIt will force the student government<br />\nto deal with much more relevant issues<br />\nthan it does now, and will insure wider<br />\nparticipation and involvement in Hop-<br />\n<br />\nkins political lifi. For instance, suppose<br />\nthe Young Democrats urge all its members to attend the next council meeting to vote for diverting gunds for the<br />\nnext dance to Vietnamese war victims,<br />\nFraternity members might then be forced to attend so that the money may be<br />\nspent on the dance. The Young Republicans would urge its members to vote<br />\nto have the money be sent to disabled<br />\nveterans. The SDS would instead urge<br />\nan alternative proposal to aid the NLF.<br />\n<br />\nThirdly, the proposal would increase<br />\nstudent power by the mere fact of<br />\nthere being more. participation. Although Dr. Gordon may be queasy over<br />\nthe idea, the goal of every community<br />\nleader \"should be an active, informed,<br />\nand willful citizenry. The example of<br />\nHopkins becoming the first major university with such a student stystem would,<br />\nof course, bring deserved honor to the<br />\nschool.<br />\n<br />\nIt would be easy to put the plan into effect.

If nothing else, the plan<br />\nwill force an awareness of issues, rather<br />\nstudent government.<br />\nthan mere glad-handing.<br />\nAthenian democracy would also result in taking student government out<br />\nof the hand of a fifteen-man committee<br />\n- - which because if its smallness is<br />\nnecessarily isolated from student interests and ideas - - and give the government to all who are ineerested and who<br />\ncare. This does not mean that various<br />\nCouncil<br />\nadministrative committees<br />\nwould not function. It does mean that<br />\nthe policies of such ,groups, such as the<br />\nhonor commission and parking committee, will be under much more scrutiny, if desired by the students.<br />\n<br />\nThe problem of the person who<br />\nfeels powerless to influence his government, and feels that its problems are<br />\nmeaningless to him, has become increasingly serious in today's mass society. Part of the reason he feels as he<br />\ndoes stems from the completely useless<br />\nnature of the governments he found<br />\naround him,from grammar school council and beyond.

They spend three weeks on the question of a dress code<br />\nin the library while several score of their fellow students are being<br />\nrobbed blind by the Plant Manager's Office.<br />\nThe first great myth that they subscribe to is that they represent<br />\nthe students. They do not represent graduate students, they do not<br />\nrepresent a majority of the undergraduates who study here. They represent a few of their immediate friends who are often the only ones<br />\naware of their existence. It is not a political structure, but a social<br />\nclub. Not a viable organization,but a Mickey Mouse debating society.<br />\nThe second great myth that the Student Council members delude<br />\nthemselves with is that they do something. This year they sent off<br />\na self-righteious letter protesting the health insurance fraud, and have<br />\nsince then spent several weeks arguing over choice of lecture speakers. This is certainly quite an admirable record of achievement.<br />\nThe Council has potential to be an active source of innovation, a<br />\nprotector of student rights, and an enrichment to the college career.<br />\nIt has chosen to be the last haven for selfish, Ivory Tower administration servants. A great part of the game rests with the leader and<br />\nhis spineless, and often mindless, underlings. And part of the blame<br />\nlies with the students who allow such a demeaning charade to go on.<br />\nThere are several alternatives. One can change the Council's outlook immediately, or one can set up a separate student government<br />\nthat will be responsible only to students, that will act with vigor, and<br />\nthat will eventually create changes to further student interests.<br />\nThe Council's interests at the moment do not coincide with the<br />\nstudents' interest. Unless this situation is remedied, the Student<br />\nCouncil may find itself without a mandate.<br />\nStudent Power is a reality, and until these junior establishment<br />\ntypes realize this and move to eradicate infringements on students'<br />\nrights, we will suffer.<br />\nAt this time the Student Council is without support, without<br />\nbrains, without leadership, and is representative in myth only. The<br />\nStudent Council is nothing, and it should be treated as such.<br /><br />\nIn Retrospect<br />\nThere are many lingering emotions which we who went on Saturday's march now feel, but most pressing of any are the feelings of<br />\ndespair and frustration.<br />\nMany despaired that violence had occured in what was hoped to<br />\nhave been a peaceful demonstration, others that not enough violence<br />\nhad occured and that the violence which did erupt was spurred more<br />\nby the U.S. marshals than by the demonstrators. But whatever the<br />\nfeelings, everyone who is concerned over our involvement in the<br />\nVietnam war had to be frustrated as the weekend closed. Not only<br />\ndid the press corps report the rally, march and demonstration in a<br />\nbiased, if not untrue, manner (as everyone there will agree); but it is<br />\nnow evident that despite the presence of well over 100,000 dissenters<br />\nin the nation's capitol, nothing will change.<br />\nSaturday was a beautiful day, and the rally at the Lincoln Memorial was even more beautiful. But as the day progressed, as the<br />\nspeeches became more obtuse, and as more busses arrived, no one<br />\ncould escape the thought of how much his presence was in vain.<br />\nThis is why violence erupted; this is why people opposed to and<br />\nafraid of violence stayed at the Pentagon all night. This is also why<br />\nRussia was soaked in bloodbath in 1917 and Algeria in 1960.

And I don't want to be<br />\nthe one to break what must be the<br />\nbest-kept secret in the world, but at the<br />\nPentagon Saturday night, a group of<br />\npeaceful, sitting-down demonstrators<br />\nwas beaten and beaten by United States Marshalls MP's and an outfit called<br />\nthe 82nd Airborne, (called by the papers, \"Detroit-hardened vets.\") I saw<br />\nthem use tear-gas and I saw them needlessly brutalize everyone they got their<br />\nhands on, but I hesitate even to bring<br />\nup such distasteful matters as the warm<br />\nand jovial dinner table that is America.<br />\nHow are you going to believe me, when<br />\nnot a single newspaper, and not a single<br />\ntelevision station, has even approximated accuracy in reporting what went on<br />\nat the Pentagon?<br />\nI was going to write an article on the<br />\nreasons for the Federal brutality. I was<br />\ngoing to consider for you the political<br />\nstrategy behind the Federal brutality,<br />\nand what it portends for the future, but<br />\nwhen I got back to Baltimore, Sunday<br />\nnight, I found out nobody even knows<br />\nthere was brutality. I've read the papapers -the Baltimore Sun, the Washington Post and Star, and the New York<br />\nTimes - - and they are lying, are bulling<br />\nit up. For what it's worth then, against<br />\nthe superstructure of falsehood in the<br />\npublic press, I'd like to tell you what<br />\nhappened at the Pentagon, on the tail<br />\nend of that foolish Peach March, from<br />\nearly evening until 4:30 Sunday morning, when I had to leave because I<br />\ncouldn't take any more. I'm sorry that<br />\nI degenerate into abrasive screeching<br />\nnow and then, but I have to be believable in the face of that glazed and<br />\nglassy reportage in the Times and its<br />\ncronies, of those absolute lies that seem<br />\nabsolutely true only because they are<br />\nwritten so calmly, with the self-assurance of the tablets of the law.<br />\nFirst of all, the Peace March reached<br />\nthe Pentagon lawn and flowed right up<br />\nonto the Pentagon steps. At about 5<br />\no'clock, kids wearing the blue arm<br />\nbands of the Mobilization, told everyone on the steps that there was every<br />\npossibility of arrest. They said if you<br />\ndon't Want to get arrested, go away.<br />\nThey said, explicitly, directly, if you<br />\ndon't go away, you'll be sorry. All but<br />\nabout 2,000 went away. I stayed because the march itself had been so unsatisfactory. It was a group therapy<br />\nsession for people who wished to \"register the protest\" with themselves and<br />\ntheir pals. It was an easy method for us<br />\nall to categorize ourselves to ourselves<br />\nas the Good People. In gaudiness and<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\ninessentiality it was rivaled only by occasional Easter Parades and cattle drives. I was, frankly, ashamed to have<br />\nstepped so lively in a thing like that.<br />\nWhat was planned for the Pentagon was<br />\na vigil, to last until Sunday midnight.<br />\nThose who stayed for the vigil felt it<br />\nwould purge them ofthe march. An arguabh point. I stayed. We were told<br />\nthat the Nip's could decide to push<br />\nthrough the crowd and arrest us all if<br />\nsomeone at the front of the crowd did<br />\nsomething illegal- - try to break through<br />\nthe wall of soldiers and punch the Pentagon or something. This, for those who<br />\nare interested, is known as the Domino<br />\nTheory of Arrest.<br />\nNext was a small action on the steps<br />\nin which a group of MPs and Marshalls<br />\nattempting to chase us back onto the<br />\nlawn was itself chased into a small corner near a wall. We giggled at the foollishness of their situation and two Marshalls beat a young man to insensibility<br />\nin reply. Later I was told that two MPs<br />\nwere trapped and beaten by the crowd,<br />\nbut I didn't see any of that. The only<br />\nother major incident of the afternoon<br />\nwas when 50-100 radical clowns made a<br />\nrush through the soldiers toward the<br />\nPentagon building. I understand four<br />\ngot inside, but I can't see how. It seems<br />\nreasonable that if the Government<br />\nwould transport 60,000 troops to the<br />\nbuilding they would also close the<br />\ndoor. In any case, they were all arrested and taken away in a van. The press,<br />\nin reporting the entire vigil, seems to<br />\nimply that the only civilians hurt were<br />\nthose who rushed for the Pentagon.<br />\nNot true. They were not hurt at all- because it was still daylight - - only arrested (except for a couple of guys who<br />\nwere tripped up) and carted away. The<br />\nreal hurting started after most of the<br />\npress was gone, and the middle-age<br />\npeople, and doctors, and professors,<br />\nand Norman Mailer. The real hurting<br />\nenjoyed both the hours and the privacy<br />\nof a bedroom perversion.<br />\nWhat formed in the afternoon was a<br />\nstraight line of demarcation with MPs<br />\non one side and demonstrators on the<br />\nother, with an inch or two between the<br />\ntwo groups. The demonstrators sang<br />\nvarious rouser songs, patriotic songs,<br />\ncivil rights songs, and a couple of hundred burned their draft cards, each one<br />\nholding it up for the crowd to see and<br />\napplaud. Sonic put flowers in the soldiers' guns. Some told the soldiers they<br />\nwere people, too, and should put down<br />\ntheir guns and join us. (As a matter of<br />\nfact, two of them did join us. This is<br />\nnot a rumor, It happened, and one was<br />\narrested immediately by the Marshal's<br />\nwhile the other made it into our crowd.<br />\nbelieve he was arrested later. This<br />\nsmall victory was announced over the<br /><br />\nmegaphones and caused us all to plead<br />\nin ernest with the soldiers. We sang the<br />\nStar Spangled Banner and This Land is<br />\nYour Land, to them, and gave them<br />\nprune juice and Ethos. I, too, tried desperately to convince some MPs of their<br />\nhumanity and good nature, but as it got<br />\ndarker and their rifle butt hammerings<br />\non our front line became more and<br />\nmore frequent, they began looking<br />\nmore and more like a line of new General Motors cars.) After the initial rush,<br />\nno demonstrators did anything at all to<br />\ncross the established line of demarcation. What we wanted - - all we wanted<br />\nwas to be there all night.<br />\nBut soon after dark, the troops advanced. It's my feeling that they decided it would be a loss of face for the<br />\nmilitary if all 2,000 of us maintained<br />\nour vigil until morning. There was no<br />\nannouncement from the troops to this<br />\neffect, but then there were at no point<br />\ncommunications from them to us. After dark they started to pick people<br />\noff the front line. They chose one, hit<br />\nhim in the back with a billy club - - not<br />\ntoo hard, just enough to bruise - - and<br />\nthen, if he turned around or tried to<br />\ngrab at the club, they lammed into him<br />\nin earnest. Then dragged him off to the<br />\npaddy wagon. The rest of the crowd<br />\nstayed seated, arms linked, with their<br />\nheads down to protect them from clubs.<br />\nAt first the points of conflict seemed<br />\nrandom. They seemed to be the results of either disorderly conduct on the<br />\npart of the individual demonstrator or<br />\noverzealousness on the part of the Marshall. Our leaders at the megaphones<br />\nkept telling us not to taunt the MPsand<br />\nthey will leave you alone. They are people, too, man! But that was a mistake,<br />\nstrategically if not generically, because<br />\naround 10:30 it became obvious the<br />\narrests occurred at precise intervals of,<br />\nsay, twenty feet, all up and down the<br />\nline. With each arrest. an MP would<br />\nmove into the vacancy, so the line went<br />\nfrom straight to scalloped. The idea was<br />\nto force wedges into our tight crowd<br />\nand then to isolate and surround small<br />\nparcels of us.<br />\nBy 11:30 their advance was well<br />\nunderway. I must tell you again that we<br />\noffered none but the most passive of<br />\nresistance, on account of there were<br />\ntwenty rows of troops, each row fifty<br />\nmen or so in length, stretching from<br />\nour lines right up the the Pentagon door<br />\nIt was obvious that in a violent action,<br />\nthey held the edge. We sat.

But if these three should receive too many eggs and rotten tomatoes from the audience, then what? Is<br />\nthere another act available?'Yes: Senator Charles Percy from Illinois.<br />\nThe recent speculation in Percy as a<br />\nGOP presidential candidate has come<br />\nmainly from those party moderates and<br />\nliberals who arc becoming panicky<br />\nabout the swift rise of Ronpld Reagan.<br />\nAs Big George rides brainwashed into<br />\nthe sunset, the only man who could prevent another conservative takeover in<br />\nMiami Beach is Percy, that is, assuming<br />\nNelson Rockefeller has outed out completely. Hence, Charles Percy is the<br />\nfallback man: Mr. Available.<br />\nPercy<br />\nhas numerous qualities<br />\nwhich make him a supurb man for the<br />\nGOP nomination. At forty-eight, Percy<br />\nis the American dream come true. Born<br />\nin Chicago slums, Percy worked his way<br />\nup as bus-boy to become president of<br />\nBell and Howell at age twenty-nine, and<br />\na millionaire at thirty-five. When he got<br />\na little bored with business, he tried<br />\nhis hand at politics losing the Illinois<br /><br />\ngovernorship in 1964 due to his public<br />\nendorsement of Barry Goldwater. But<br />\nglamour and youth aren't all that Percy<br />\nhas to offer. Unlike Reagan who is often charged with hiding a glittering facade behind his glittering facade, Percy<br />\nis respected for his brains and innovative abilities. His home-ownership for<br />\nslum clearance bill, and his All-Asian<br />\nPeace Conference proposal have wide<br />\nappeal to GOP progressives. To many<br />\nRepublicans, Percy is the party's Jack<br />\nKennedy, finally Percy's rapport with<br />\nGoldwater in 1964, plus his pragmatic<br />\napproach to issues make him the foremost compromise candidate after Nixon. Both the liberal Eastern establishment and western neo-conscrvatives<br />\ncould pallatc him.<br />\nHowever, Percy has some almost insurmountable obstacles to conquer if he<br />\nis really ambitious for the 1968 nomination. First, to be the fallback candidate, Romney would have to relinquish the ground he now holds. But<br />\nchances are he won't. even if the roof<br />\ncaves in. Also, William Scranton and<br />\nNelson Rockefeller who could ignite<br />\na mass migration from Romney to Percy, have kept silent. Second, Percy<br />\nmust put together some sort of organization to be noticed by party bosses<br />\nand convention delegates. However, if<br />\nhe attracts too much public attention,<br />\nhe risks falling into the overexposure<br /><br />\ntrap which caught Romney.<br />\nThe probability of Percy receiving<br />\nthe nomination is regretably low; of the<br />\nfive top contenders Percy is a poor<br />\nfifth. Unfortunately, Republican conventions are ideological - - not rational,<br />\nand this makes either Reagan or Nixon<br />\ntoo far ahead for Percy to catch up. If<br />\nthese men bite the dust, however, Percy will no doubt be available. But under<br />\npresent political conditions, that \"if\"'<br />\nis incredibly remote.<br />\nPercy is perhaps best characterized<br />\nas the man of the future. Six year<br />\nyounger than Nixon, eight years youngger than Reagan, and twelve years<br />\nyounger than Romney, he could bypass<br />\n1968, if the party is still intact afterwards. Or, he could try for vice-president now, as Kennedy did on the Decratic side in 1956, and come up again<br />\n(and much stronger) in 1972. But either<br />\nway, the name of Charles Percy on the<br />\nGOP ticket would enhance the party's<br />\nchance to rent the White House. To be<br />\nsure, Percy is one man who would appeal to the masses of American voters<br />\nagainst Johnson. If by some divine act,<br />\nthe 1968 Republican convention should<br />\nbecome rational (rather than ideologic.a1), Chuck Percy would raft', top billing. Until then, he will remain Mr.<br />\nAvailable.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE,OCTOBER 27, 1967<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nlim<br />\n(11111111,T<br />\nirti %!11<br />\nivaite<br />\nMIN1111\u2022111.<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\n\u2022 ..-\u20224* \u2022<br /><br />\nncti\u2022VI<br /><br />\nArt by Barber &amp; Ziskin<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,OCTOBER 27, 1967<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE SIX<br /><br />\nThe Sounds of Silence<br />\nCouncil Queasy<br />\nTo Assert Self<br /><br />\nLapdog Councils<br />\nIn Open Revolt<br />\nSpurred by the wave of student involvement in recent years, the traditionally non-controversial and powerless Student Councils have recently asserted their positions as legitimate members of the academic community, who<br />\nare entitled to participate in the decision-making of the University.<br />\nCouncils, at many colleges, are drawing up bills of student rights, demanding a voice in the matter of curriculum<br />\nand openly challengin injustices in the<br />\nUniversity structure.<br />\nStudent \"Magna Carta\"<br />\nAt BErkeley, the student govern<br />\nment hammered out a Staterhent on<br />\nRights and Freedoms of Students,<br />\nwhich was popularly referred to as a<br />\n\"Magna Carta.\"<br />\nThe statement's provisions rectify<br />\nthe excesses of misadministration.

It has failed to move<br />\nsignificantly into the areas of student<br />\nrights, participation in major decisions<br />\nand social involvement. It has also failed<br />\nto challenge Administration policy in<br />\ncrucial areas.<br />\nLast November, a controversy arose<br />\non campus when a local barber refused<br />\nto serve a Negro Hopkins student. The<br />\ncontroversy was first publicly aired by<br />\nsmall activist groups on campus. Subsequently, the Newsletter publicized the<br /><br />\nThe City-State of Homewood<br />\nby JAMES WULACH<br />\nThe characteristic Hopkins apathy<br />\nand non-involvement is so ingrained, it<br />\nhas become a cliche. The fault partially<br />\nrests within human nature, but the fact<br />\nthat other campuses are much more<br />\nalive, aware and involved suggests that<br />\nour system, particularly epitomized by<br />\nour Student Council, is to blame. This<br />\nis what the idea of an Athenian Democracy at the Hopkins hopes to change.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is deliberately small<br />\nin enrollment - because, as University<br />\npropaganda proclaims, it combines the<br />\nscholarly advantages of a university with<br />\nthe closeness of a community. From experience, the Hopkins student knows<br />\nthat this is merely propaganda. However, Hopkins smallness l'acilitates the<br />\nidea of Athenian Democracy as a replacement for Student Council.<br />\n\"Direct Participation\"<br />\nLike the Athenian system, or the<br />\nfamed town-hall meetings of early New<br />\nEngland, the smallness of our student<br />\nbody easily can allow every person direct participation and voting in student<br />\ngovernment decisions. At first, such a<br />\nsimple plan may be shrugged off as<br />\nUtopian nonsense, but here is what it<br />\nwill do:<br />\nIt will force the student government<br />\nto deal with much more relevant issues<br />\nthan it does now, and will insure wider<br />\nparticipation and involvement in Hop-<br /><br />\nkins political lifi. For instance, suppose<br />\nthe Young Democrats urge all its members to attend the next council meeting to vote for diverting gunds for the<br />\nnext dance to Vietnamese war victims,<br />\nFraternity members might then be forced to attend so that the money may be<br />\nspent on the dance. The Young Republicans would urge its members to vote<br />\nto have the money be sent to disabled<br />\nveterans. The SDS would instead urge<br />\nan alternative proposal to aid the NLF.<br /><br />\nThirdly, the proposal would increase<br />\nstudent power by the mere fact of<br />\nthere being more. participation. Although Dr. Gordon may be queasy over<br />\nthe idea, the goal of every community<br />\nleader \"should be an active, informed,<br />\nand willful citizenry. The example of<br />\nHopkins becoming the first major university with such a student stystem would,<br />\nof course, bring deserved honor to the<br />\nschool.<br /><br />\nIt would be easy to put the plan into effect. Student petition could force<br />\nInterest Groups<br />\nGradually, more :Ind more people a constitutional amendment; the prewould become invo'Ned with protec- sent student council could voluntarily<br />\nting and furthering their interests disband itself; or, candidates could run<br />\nthrough the student government. Im- for council office on this platform,<br />\nportant issues would be centralized and with the backing of a Community<br />\nfocused for every student around the Council Party. If nothing else, the plan<br />\nwill force an awareness of issues, rather<br />\nstudent government.<br />\nthan mere glad-handing.<br />\nAthenian democracy would also result in taking student government out<br />\nof the hand of a fifteen-man committee<br />\n- - which because if its smallness is<br />\nnecessarily isolated from student interests and ideas - - and give the government to all who are ineerested and who<br />\ncare. This does not mean that various<br />\nCouncil<br />\nadministrative committees<br />\nwould not function. It does mean that<br />\nthe policies of such ,groups, such as the<br />\nhonor commission and parking committee, will be under much more scrutiny, if desired by the students.<br /><br />\nThe problem of the person who<br />\nfeels powerless to influence his government, and feels that its problems are<br />\nmeaningless to him, has become increasingly serious in today's mass society. Part of the reason he feels as he<br />\ndoes stems from the completely useless<br />\nnature of the governments he found<br />\naround him,from grammar school council and beyond.

Hopkins, which had rallied to<br />\n28-14 on Joe Cowan's 43-yard run after<br />\na reverse and a 34-yard pass from Jim<br />\nFeely (15 of 27 for 257 yards on the<br />\nday) to Paul Weiss, had what would<br />\nhave been a first down on the Randolph-Macon twenty yard line nullified<br />\nby a penalty. Shortly thereafter came<br />\nthe interception, which set up the<br />\ntouchdown which made the score 34-14<br />\nand put the contest out of reach.<br />\nUnoffical statistics give Cowan team<br />\nleadership in rushing (339 yards on 26<br />\ntrips for a 13.0 average per carry), receiving (18 catches for 399 yards and a<br />\n22.2 mean), and scoring (71 points on<br />\neleven T.D.'s and five coverstions.)<br />\nOther rushing contributors include<br />\nWeiss (57-315-5.5), Feely (36-66-1.8),<br />\nincluding several losses attempting to<br />\npass), Jeff Sienkiewicz, (15-59-3.9),<br />\nWill Scroggs (8-46-5.8), and Mark Croft<br />\n(12-45-3.8).<br />\nFeely has completed 39 of 63 passes<br />\n(62%) for 740 yards and seven scores<br />\nwith three interceptions and an average<br />\ngain per attempt of 11.74. Cowan and<br />\nSteve Latson (13 receptions for 196<br />\nyards) have been his main targets.<br />\nPrior to the Randolph-Macon game,<br />\nHopkins had ranked third in the nation<br />\nin small college total offense (averaging<br />\n448.7 yards per game), seventh in scoring (38.3 points per game), and eighth<br />\nin rushing offense (279.3 yards a contest). If the other listed schools were to<br />\nmaintain their previous paces, the Jays<br />\nwould - after last Saturday - be likely to<br />\nremain in the top ten only in total offense (new average: 417.3). The revised<br />\nrushing mean is 226.0 and the team's<br />\nscoring average is down to 31.8 points<br />\nper game.<br /><br />\nNEXT WEEK'S SCHEDULE<br />\nSOCCER<br />\nHopkins vs. Lynchburg Saturday, October 28 - 2:00p.m.<br />\nHopkins vs. Towson State Wednesday, November 1 - Away<br />\nCROSS-COUNTRY<br />\nHopkins vs. Towson State -<br /><br />\nHome<br /><br />\nFrosh Flatten First Foe<br />\nWith the ball fifty-three yards from<br />\nthe goal, Pfeifer unleashed a bomb,<br />\nwhich was in the air for 35 yards, to a<br />\nspeedy Pete Zangara who had gone on<br />\nthe fly over the middle and took the<br />\npass to the twelve. Pfeifer flipped a six<br />\nyard arcial to Zangara for his second<br />\ntouchdown pass. He finished the day<br />\nfive for fifteen and 81 yards. Ed Dunbar plunged off left tackle for the two<br />\npoint conversion.<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall finally blemished a perfect defense as they ran the<br />\nkickoff back 85 yards leaving every<br />\nHopkins player prostrate in their wake.<br />\nThe frosh obviously outclassed their<br />\nPennsylvanian opponents on this sundrenched field before an unusually good<br />\ncrowd for their home opener. They<br />\nchalked up eleven first downs to six bY<br />\nF&amp;M. Although they dominated the<br />\ngame statistically, the freshmen will<br />\nhave to add polish to an offense which<br />\nmade eight penalties and three fumbles,<br />\nbefore they engage the Susquehanna<br />\nJ.V. at home on Monday, October 30.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40246, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "8a166b49-2497-4e29-92a6-79e707035562", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13937-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13937, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "c6420ff0-a125-4954-8c7c-7425b3e52723", "url": "/node/13937"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "a92bd9cd-1f70-4d9b-8ffb-64f3097ea688"}]}
