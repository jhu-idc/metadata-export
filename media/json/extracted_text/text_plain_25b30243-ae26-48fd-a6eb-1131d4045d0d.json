M. C. A. usuallly<br />\nsucceeds in accomplishing whatever it sets out to do. We hope this<br />\nwill be the case in the recently organized drive for funds. Two years<br />\nago, Hopkins needed a student activities building badly, but the<br />\nUniversity was not in a position to erect one. The Y. M. C. A. undertook the task, and with the handicap of a skeptical student body,<br />\nconducted a drive for funds. Many of the contributions were made<br />\nbecause the Y. M. C. A. was backing the drive, and not solely for<br />\nthe benefit of activities at Johns Hopkins University. We can hardly<br />\nsee how any fairminded person can take any attitude but that of<br />\nthanking the Y. M. C. A. for its philanthropy.<br />\nLast year numerous experiments had to be made in Levering<br />\nHall. A considerable deficit resulted. We can hardly say that this<br />\nwas due to mismanagement. If at the end of this year the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nagain has a deficit, charges of mismanagement might be expected.<br />\nWe are of the opinion that prices in the cafeteria should be reduced,<br />\nbut otherwise Levering Hall seems to be efficiently managed.<br />\nThe Y. M. C. A. goes to a great expense in furnishing things<br />\nneeded by the student. The money contributed by the Student Activities Council by no means pays for these various services. Outside<br />\ncontribution by friends of the \"Y\" pay for all purely Y. M. C. A.<br />\nactivities, and for the major part of the services rendered the campus<br />\nas a whole. Levering Hall is open to all students for purposes of<br />\nrecreation and study, or for business and social meetings. The library<br />\ncontains magazines, newspapers, and some current fiction. Cards and<br />\ncheckers are furnished for all who desire them. Rooms for meetings<br />\nor dances may be procured upon notice gratuitously. For these services<br />\nalone the Y. M. C. A. deserves liberal contributions frbm the students.<br />\nFor those interested in activities, the \"Y\" has done even more.<br />\nThe offices have been built and furnished by the Y. M. C. A. and are<br />\nnow kept in repair by that organization. Other special groups are<br />\nalso benefited. The Rooming Bureau gives free service to out-of-town<br />\nstudents. Foreign students are entertained by the \"Y\". Although the<br />\nhandbook is made to pay for itself, were it not for the activity of<br />\nthe Y, no such volume would be published.<br />\nWe have endeavored to previously point out that the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nis not financially compensated by the student for these various activities, and we are of the firm conviction that the \"Y\" has the right to put<br />\non such a drive and to expect that it will meet with the utmost<br />\nsuccess.<br />\n<br />\nDEBATING<br />\nOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY has always stood among the<br />\nleading institutions of the country in scholarship. It seems quite<br />\nunusual and indeed regretable that so little interest is manifested in<br />\ndebating, an activity obviously of great intellectual stimulation. In the<br />\npast, debating was one of the leading activities on the campus, and<br />\nthere is no plausible reason why it should not still be. The lack of<br />\ninterest has been so apparent that the officials of the University will<br />\nno longer sponsor inter-college debates.<br />\nWith an increased undergraduate enrollment, an increased interest<br />\nwas expected this year. On the contrary, less interest has been shown<br />\nthan ever before. Can it be that students do not care to be intellectually stimulated, and prefer to use their minds as little as necessary?<br />\n<br />\nIS the integrated expression of<br />\nmany exceptional qualities.\"<br />\nIs Endogenous Growth<br />\n\"The quality of leadership is an<br />\nendogenous growth,\" said the lecturer. \"There must be confidence<br />\nin yourself and in the children of<br />\nyour brain; the courage to accept<br />\nresponsibility and to act upon matured conclusions; the willingness<br />\nto pay the price of leadership, and<br />\nhard continuous work.\"<br />\nThere should always be a definite<br />\ngoal toward which all effort is directed, he further said. \"We may<br />\nnever reach the goal, but we shall<br />\ncertainly go further than he who is<br />\nsauntering without one.\"<br />\nLeaders do not wait for the arrival of opportunity, said Dr. Little,<br />\neven though alert to seize it when<br />\nit presents itself, but go out to meet<br />\nit, and create it if it's not present.<br />\nHeavy Prices Paid<br />\n<br />\nYears of poverty, and physical<br />\nlimitations and disabilities are two<br />\nof the outstanding prices paid by<br />\nboth men and women in the quest<br />\nfor leadership in varied fields.<br />\n\"The great laboratory leaders<br />\nhave always been distinguished for<br />\ntheir power of stimulating originality ill others.

M. C. A. usuallly<br />\nsucceeds in accomplishing whatever it sets out to do. We hope this<br />\nwill be the case in the recently organized drive for funds. Two years<br />\nago, Hopkins needed a student activities building badly, but the<br />\nUniversity was not in a position to erect one. The Y. M. C. A. undertook the task, and with the handicap of a skeptical student body,<br />\nconducted a drive for funds. Many of the contributions were made<br />\nbecause the Y. M. C. A. was backing the drive, and not solely for<br />\nthe benefit of activities at Johns Hopkins University. We can hardly<br />\nsee how any fairminded person can take any attitude but that of<br />\nthanking the Y. M. C. A. for its philanthropy.<br />\nLast year numerous experiments had to be made in Levering<br />\nHall. A considerable deficit resulted. We can hardly say that this<br />\nwas due to mismanagement. If at the end of this year the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nagain has a deficit, charges of mismanagement might be expected.<br />\nWe are of the opinion that prices in the cafeteria should be reduced,<br />\nbut otherwise Levering Hall seems to be efficiently managed.<br />\nThe Y. M. C. A. goes to a great expense in furnishing things<br />\nneeded by the student. The money contributed by the Student Activities Council by no means pays for these various services. Outside<br />\ncontribution by friends of the \"Y\" pay for all purely Y. M. C. A.<br />\nactivities, and for the major part of the services rendered the campus<br />\nas a whole. Levering Hall is open to all students for purposes of<br />\nrecreation and study, or for business and social meetings. The library<br />\ncontains magazines, newspapers, and some current fiction. Cards and<br />\ncheckers are furnished for all who desire them. Rooms for meetings<br />\nor dances may be procured upon notice gratuitously. For these services<br />\nalone the Y. M. C. A. deserves liberal contributions frbm the students.<br />\nFor those interested in activities, the \"Y\" has done even more.<br />\nThe offices have been built and furnished by the Y. M. C. A. and are<br />\nnow kept in repair by that organization. Other special groups are<br />\nalso benefited. The Rooming Bureau gives free service to out-of-town<br />\nstudents. Foreign students are entertained by the \"Y\". Although the<br />\nhandbook is made to pay for itself, were it not for the activity of<br />\nthe Y, no such volume would be published.<br />\nWe have endeavored to previously point out that the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nis not financially compensated by the student for these various activities, and we are of the firm conviction that the \"Y\" has the right to put<br />\non such a drive and to expect that it will meet with the utmost<br />\nsuccess.<br /><br />\nDEBATING<br />\nOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY has always stood among the<br />\nleading institutions of the country in scholarship. It seems quite<br />\nunusual and indeed regretable that so little interest is manifested in<br />\ndebating, an activity obviously of great intellectual stimulation. In the<br />\npast, debating was one of the leading activities on the campus, and<br />\nthere is no plausible reason why it should not still be. The lack of<br />\ninterest has been so apparent that the officials of the University will<br />\nno longer sponsor inter-college debates.<br />\nWith an increased undergraduate enrollment, an increased interest<br />\nwas expected this year. On the contrary, less interest has been shown<br />\nthan ever before. Can it be that students do not care to be intellectually stimulated, and prefer to use their minds as little as necessary?<br /><br />\nIS the integrated expression of<br />\nmany exceptional qualities.\"<br />\nIs Endogenous Growth<br />\n\"The quality of leadership is an<br />\nendogenous growth,\" said the lecturer. \"There must be confidence<br />\nin yourself and in the children of<br />\nyour brain; the courage to accept<br />\nresponsibility and to act upon matured conclusions; the willingness<br />\nto pay the price of leadership, and<br />\nhard continuous work.\"<br />\nThere should always be a definite<br />\ngoal toward which all effort is directed, he further said. \"We may<br />\nnever reach the goal, but we shall<br />\ncertainly go further than he who is<br />\nsauntering without one.\"<br />\nLeaders do not wait for the arrival of opportunity, said Dr. Little,<br />\neven though alert to seize it when<br />\nit presents itself, but go out to meet<br />\nit, and create it if it's not present.<br />\nHeavy Prices Paid<br /><br />\nYears of poverty, and physical<br />\nlimitations and disabilities are two<br />\nof the outstanding prices paid by<br />\nboth men and women in the quest<br />\nfor leadership in varied fields.<br />\n\"The great laboratory leaders<br />\nhave always been distinguished for<br />\ntheir power of stimulating originality ill others.
