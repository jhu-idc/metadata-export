All matters regarding activities are given over to the Student Activities Council. These two bodies are not figureheads, but have complete control over their respective fields. The S. A.

Not since the St. John's lacrosse game last spring<br />\nhave the Jays pulled a real upset. In former years, Hopkins teams<br />\nseemed to have the habit of giving little surprise parties at rather regular intervals. Of late, however, these occasions have been conspicuous<br />\nby their absence. Let us pray for more and better surprise parties.<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\nDEBATING AGAIN<br />\nN a rcent issue of the NEWS-LETTER we made a misstatement to<br />\nthe effect that the Dean objected to the manner in which trials were<br />\nconducted for the debating council. We were misinformed on this<br />\nquestion. We also stated the senior tryouts were unjust. Perhaps we<br />\nwere wrong as only three men appeared at the tryouts for the three<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\npositions on the team.<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\nT F THE Hopkins undergraduate<br />\n1 school is ever to attain intellectual independence, it must depart from the standards established<br />\nby other American colleges. I<br />\nshould like to see the College evolve<br />\nto the point where students would<br />\nbe allowed perfect freedom after<br />\ntwo years' initial preparation\u2014freedom to pursue their intellectual interests in unconventional style. I<br />\nwould have formal lecturing abolished and in its place informal discussion between professor and student in the intimacy of small friendly groups.<br />\nThe student should be allowed to<br />\nspend much of his time reading the<br />\nliterature in his chosen field, absorbing culture and knowledge by<br />\ninfiltration rather than hot-house<br />\nforcing. Formal examinations<br />\nwould no longer harass the undergraduate although before he received a degree, he should certainly<br />\nbe required to present convincing<br />\nevidence in the form of essay or<br />\ndissertation and oral examination of<br />\nhis ability to correlate intelligently<br />\nthe information and culture he has<br />\namassed. St. Johns has done some-<br />\n<br />\nIV<br />\nS FOR the recreational activities in this new College, Hopkins could again contribute something of worth by swinging American colleges away from the overemphasis which has been placed on<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. Personally,<br />\nI should like to see intercollegiate<br />\nathletic competition dropped by the<br />\nJohns Hopkins, I should like to see<br />\na return to the English idea of sport<br />\nfor sport's sake rather than for the<br />\nsake of winning. And, above all, I<br />\nshould like to see athletics made<br />\navailable for each and every undergraduate no matter what his talents.<br />\n`.`flank\" Iddins could be relegated<br />\nto the bond business or perhaps he<br />\nwould do well raising an endowment<br />\nfor the University.<br />\nPerhaps I am over-optimistic in<br />\nexpecting Hopkins to emerge from<br />\nthe period of lethargy which has<br />\nlong enveloped it. But if the Y. M.<br />\nC.

Not since the St. John's lacrosse game last spring<br />\nhave the Jays pulled a real upset.

I<br />\nshould like to see the College evolve<br />\nto the point where students would<br />\nbe allowed perfect freedom after<br />\ntwo years' initial preparation\u2014freedom to pursue their intellectual interests in unconventional style. I<br />\nwould have formal lecturing abolished and in its place informal discussion between professor and student in the intimacy of small friendly groups.<br />\nThe student should be allowed to<br />\nspend much of his time reading the<br />\nliterature in his chosen field, absorbing culture and knowledge by<br />\ninfiltration rather than hot-house<br />\nforcing. Formal examinations<br />\nwould no longer harass the undergraduate although before he received a degree, he should certainly<br />\nbe required to present convincing<br />\nevidence in the form of essay or<br />\ndissertation and oral examination of<br />\nhis ability to correlate intelligently<br />\nthe information and culture he has<br />\namassed. St. Johns has done some-<br /><br />\nIV<br />\nS FOR the recreational activities in this new College, Hopkins could again contribute something of worth by swinging American colleges away from the overemphasis which has been placed on<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. Personally,<br />\nI should like to see intercollegiate<br />\nathletic competition dropped by the<br />\nJohns Hopkins, I should like to see<br />\na return to the English idea of sport<br />\nfor sport's sake rather than for the<br />\nsake of winning. And, above all, I<br />\nshould like to see athletics made<br />\navailable for each and every undergraduate no matter what his talents.<br />\n`.`flank\" Iddins could be relegated<br />\nto the bond business or perhaps he<br />\nwould do well raising an endowment<br />\nfor the University.<br />\nPerhaps I am over-optimistic in<br />\nexpecting Hopkins to emerge from<br />\nthe period of lethargy which has<br />\nlong enveloped it.
