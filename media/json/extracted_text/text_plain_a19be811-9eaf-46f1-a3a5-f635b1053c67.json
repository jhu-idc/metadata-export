We had spent the<br />\nearlier hours of the August afternoon loitering<br />\nabout the old abbey ruin of Glastonbury, which<br />\nlay dreaming in summer quiet so perfect that one<br />\ncould easily believe this was indeed the\"island<br />\nvalley of Avilion,\"<br />\n\"Where falls not rain or hail, or any snow,<br />\nNor ever wind blows loudly.\"<br />\nThence we had wheeled over the high road that<br />\nskirts the field of Sedgemoor, and on through<br />\nthe sleepy town of Bridgewater, so that it was<br />\nnow past sundown when we coasted down a<br />\ngentle hill, under over-archin trees, and entered<br />\nNether Stowev.<br />\nThe group of stone cottages that make up the<br />\nk and d reary;<br />\ntiny village looked somew hat blan<br />\nbut they are nestled cosilY into a hollow, and a<br />\nbright stream of water runs leisurely down<br />\nthrough the main street. The whole country<br />\nthereabout is soft and green, with groves and<br />\nlazy brooks, the ground falling now into little<br />\nvalleys and then rising again int() easy sloping<br />\nhills, that a mile or so eastward run up to a<br />\nhigher elevation,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"Smooth Quantock's airy ridge,\"<br />\nof<br />\nscreech<br />\nThe<br />\nsea.<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nsight<br />\nwhence you get<br />\nthis<br />\nthe locomotive has never yet been heard in<br />\nd<br />\nunchange<br />\nstand<br />\nthings<br />\nall<br />\nand<br />\npastoral region,<br />\nago.<br />\nyears<br />\nhundred<br />\na<br />\nas they were<br />\nof<br />\nWe were taking our wheels into the yard<br />\nwith<br />\nus<br />\ninformed<br />\nhost<br />\nthe<br />\nwhen<br />\ninn,<br />\nthe village<br />\nassurances of regret that he was \"full up,\" and<br />\ncould not possibly lodge us.

His wife, moreover, be said had gone<br />\n<br />\nNo. 1.<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nto a flower show some miles away, and in the<br />\nabsence of \"The Missus,\" supper was an uncertain quantity ; but some one might be found to<br />\nget us a bit of baeon. Meantime, we started<br />\nout at once to find the object of our visit before<br />\nthe long twilight should darken into night.<br />\nAt the end of the street we found it\u2014the last<br />\ncottage but one before the street runs out into<br />\nthe open fields. A small square cottage, with a<br />\nneglected and lonesome look, its door opening<br />\ndirectly upon the roadside. But cheerless as it<br />\nlooks now, and cheerless as it must have been to<br />\noutward looks a hundred years ago, there is<br />\nperhaps hardly a roof in England under which<br />\nthere has been truer cheer or nobler thinking.<br />\nFor this is the humble cottage of Toni Poole to<br />\nwhich came in the last days of 1797 Samuel<br />\nTaylor Coleridge, to -take up his abode, determined to live thriftily and to devote himself to<br />\nagriculture and literature. \"We want but<br />\nthree rooms,\" he wrote Poole;and by dismissing<br />\nhis servant, practicing rigid economy, and<br />\nabstaining from animal food, he is confident that<br />\nhe can sustain himself, his wife and child, on sixteen shillings a week. In the day-time he will<br />\ngive himself, body and soul, to the garden ; in<br />\nthe evenings, to literature. The agriculture, of<br />\ncourse, did not thrive; but the literature did.<br />\nIt was in this little cottage that most of \"The<br />\nRime of the Ancient Mariner,\" and of the first<br />\npart of \"Christabel\" were written. It was sitting by the fireside in this tiny room that he<br />\nwrote those exquisite lines, Frost at Midnight,<br />\nwhile at his side his \"cradled infant slumbered<br />\npeacefully.\" It was in the little parlor that<br />\nWilliam and Dorothy Wordsworth paid their<br />\nfirst visit to him, and afterward talked many a<br />\ntime far into the night. It was here, during this<br />\nvisit of the Wordsworths, that Charles Lamb,<br />\ntoo, came to visit his earliest and best friend;<br />\nand in the room upstairs, Coleridge, detained at<br />\nhome by illness while his friends were roaming<br />\nover the Quantock hills, wrote that touching<br />\ntribute to his friend, \"The Lime Tree Bower My<br />\nPrison \"\u2014verses which he recalled with mourn<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nful longings only a few weeks before he died.<br />\nThis little cottage was the shrine of William<br />\nHazlitt's pilgrimage, and here he passed three<br />\nhappy weeks, sitting through the long summer<br />\nafternoons in the arbor in the back garden or<br />\nunder the elm trees, \"listening to the bees bumming around us while we quaffed our flip.\" It<br />\nwas here that the fussy little Bristol bookseller<br />\ncame to see the young poet, and in the arbor<br />\nstruck the bargain for publishing that volume<br />\nwhich began the new poetry in England\u2014Lyrcal Ballads.<br />\nA plain tablet has been affixed to the front wall<br />\nof the cottage, informing the passer-by that the<br />\npoet-philosoper once dwelt here; and the weary<br />\nlooking little woman who now tenants it had<br />\nheard of the great Mr. Coleridge, and showed us<br />\nthe room\u2014the left-hand one,up the stair\u2014where<br />\n\"they say he used to sit and write.\" Sometimes<br />\nshe had one or two lodgers, she said, mostly<br />\ncity folk who wanted a bit of outing at little<br />\ncost; but very few people ever came to ask anything about Mr. Coleridge. She supposed he<br />\nwas there a great while ago, and most people<br />\nhad forgotten about it. The four rooms that<br />\nColeridge and his family occupied can have<br />\nchanged but little since he was here; but they<br />\nwere frowsy and uninviting. The garden behind the cottage has been divided and most of it<br />\nsold; the arbor and the trees are gone. The<br />\nwhole place had a rueful look, and it was bard<br />\nfor us to people it with the forms that once held<br />\nconverse there. As we left the garden in the<br />\ndusk and passed through the cottage again to<br />\nthe street, the bare rooms reminded me most,not<br />\nof that glad summer of 1798, but of that next<br />\nwinter, when Coleridge was in Germany, and<br />\npoor Sara Coleridge watched here through<br />\nmournful days and nights alone by the cradle of<br />\nher dying baby, and cried out, at last, that she<br />\ncould stay in this place no longer.<br />\nNext morning we visited a fairer shrine. After<br />\na night's sound sleep in the tidy attic of the<br />\ncarter's house and an excellent breakfast which<br />\n\"the Missus\" insisted on serving with her own<br />\nhands, we rode over to Alfoxden House, where<br />\nWordsworth lived in that annus mirabllis,179798. The poets used to say it was a walk of only<br />\nthree miles; our prosaic cyclometers made it<br />\n<br />\nnearly five. But the last mile and a-half of the<br />\nway lay through that park and wood which is<br />\nconsecrated by such frequent poetic mention.<br />\nThis is the walk that young Hazlitt took<br />\n\"through echoing grove, by fairy stream and<br />\nwaterfall, glimmering in the summer moonlight,\" while all the while the orphic voice of<br />\nColeridge by his side sounded high<br />\n\"Of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate.\"<br />\n<br />\nIt was along this path that Coleridge and<br />\nWordsworth walked a hundred times together;<br />\nit was in a glade by the brook here that Coleridge exclaimed one morning, \"This is a place to<br />\nreconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of<br />\nthe world \"; it was in these trees that the nightingales sang all that spring, and sing forever in<br />\nColeridge's verse. In this park lived the old<br />\nhuntsman, Simon Lee, and it was here that<br />\nwordsworth wrote the Night Piece, and the<br />\nLines in Early Spring, and Expostulation and<br />\nReply. The walk can have changed little since<br />\nthen, for the forest is old and has been carefully<br />\npreserved; the stream still skips and sings, and<br />\n\"'Twill murmur on a thousand years,<br />\nAnd flow as now it flows.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe house, too, though slightly enlarged, can<br />\nhardly have been altered much since Wordsworth<br />\nand Dorothywere here; Dorothy's description ofit<br />\nin her delightful journal might have been written<br />\nyesterday. It stands solid,almost stately,fronting the south,at thefoot ofa smooth hill that rises<br />\nalmost from the very door, still \"topped with<br />\nfern and sprinkled with trees,\" as when Dorothy looked out upon it. To the west a growth<br />\nof young wood has shut out the view of the sea<br />\nshe says she had; but otherwise we see to-day<br />\nwhat Dorothy saw.<br />\nWe were fortunate in the time of our visit, as<br />\nthe house was occupied only by a care-taker,and<br />\na note to him from our host of the Stowey Inn<br />\ngained us permission to look about it as we<br />\nchose. Here was the chamber in which Hazlitt<br />\nslept on the night of his stay at Alfoxden,and in<br />\nthe morning from his window that looked upon<br />\nthe hill, \"heard the loud stag speak.\" Here in<br />\nDorothy's sitting-room a climbing rose had<br />\nthrust a spray of blossoms in at the open window where she used to sit. But after all it was<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nmost pleasant to lie upon the turf outside, under<br />\nthe same great elms that shadowed the poet in<br />\ntheir youth a century ago, repeat his verses,and<br />\nread once more Dorothy's charming Journal.<br />\nWe lingered here till noon, letting the scene photograph itself in our memory, and then we rode<br />\non, over the Quantocks, past Kilve church\u2014<br />\nwhere \"there is no weather-cock \"\u2014to Porlock.<br />\nIn this most picturesque of all English villages,<br />\nhidden in one of the bowery clefts that break the<br />\nhigh line of the Devon coast, we saw the very<br />\n\"man from Porlock\" that disturbed the vision<br />\nof Kubla Khan; we\u2014but that is another story.<br />\nC.

Our correspondent is all right ; THE NEws-LETTER ought<br />\nto be improved. We have two or three ideas<br />\nalong that line ourselves. His motto, however,<br />\nis now nailed to the top of oureditorial desk and<br />\nis a source of considerable inspiration to us.<br />\nJuniors and Seniors will read this letter with a<br />\ngood deal of satisfaction. We hope they will<br />\nfall in with its\"spirits.\" There is also a modest<br />\nsuggestion to the faculty.<br />\nDear Mr. Editor: I have not been at Hopkins<br />\nvery long, but I am very full of Hopkins spirits,<br />\nand I want to write something for THE NEWSLETTER right off. I think everybody ought to<br />\nwrite for THE NEWS LETTER and help to make<br />\n<br />\ntoalltet:<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nit better. I read once that \"Improvement is<br />\nthe order of the age.\" I am a firm believer in<br />\ncollege spirits. We ought to have more at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nNow, to make a practical suggestion, I think<br />\nif the junior class, since we do not have any<br />\nmore hazing, if they would give some kind of a<br />\nreception or \"feed\" to the freshmen and tell<br />\nthem all about things and how to yell and<br />\nwhat to do at the games it would be a good<br />\nthing. The seniors might also do this. And<br />\nthen the professors ought to buy tickets for the<br />\ngames.<br />\nAnother good thing for college spirits is to<br />\nwear a Hopkins pin. I have one I wear every<br />\nday and it attracts a great deal of attention.<br />\nYou see the better your college is known the<br />\nmore men come to it and you can have bigger<br />\nteams. In this way we could get into the class<br />\nwith Yale and Harvard and other big schools.<br />\nI am a firm believer in pins.<br />\nLastly I think every fellow ought to work<br />\nhard at his studies and to raise the standard of<br />\nhis institution. This has more to do with college spirits than you would at first think for it<br />\nwould bring a better class of men to your college and there would be more spirits. I do not<br />\nthink it is good to drink or smoke cigarettes<br />\nwhile you are studying, though I once knew a<br />\nfellow who got a scholarship and drank a good<br />\ndeal of beer. (It was at another college). It is<br />\nalso very bad for the teams,for you cannot play<br />\nfoot-ball and drink beer at the same time. Every<br />\nphysical director ought to make very strict<br />\nrules about this and set his men a good example,<br />\nthough I suppose nothing of this kind is called<br />\nfor in our university with its high standing.<br />\nBut humanum est errare.<br />\nA FRESHMAN.<br />\nP.

There<br />\nwere many serious predictions for the future of<br />\nthe clubs At the close of last year, for a large<br />\nnumber of the members would not be here this<br />\nyear to aid in making things joyful or otherwise.<br />\nBut as most other storm clouds, these rumors<br />\npassed off after a little noise as quietly as they<br />\nhad come and now everything points to a most<br />\npromising year with as good if not better clubs<br />\nthan formerly. Of course there have been serious<br />\nlosses both in men and leaders, but even now<br />\nwith the loss of I. A.Thorson, leader of the Mandolin Club, and Girvin Peters, leader of the Glee<br />\nClub, the musical clubs are not as badly off as<br />\nthey were at the beginning of last year. For<br />\nthen there was no one who would undertake to<br />\nlead the Banjo Club. Peters was not sure<br />\nwhether he would have time for the Glee Club,<br />\nand Vogeler was compelled to resign his leadership of the Mandolin Club immediately after it<br />\nhad gotten into good shape. But now all three<br />\nclubs have leaders and every member takes a<br />\nlively interest in the welfare of the clubs. One<br />\nother thing that points to success is that Manager Bird has made the very best contract that<br />\nthe clubs have ever made with Mr. Fisher, by<br />\nwhich he will give the Glee Club a larger proportion of his time than usual.<br />\nThe men who have been received as candidates<br />\nfor the clubs up to date include: Wolf, Nelson,<br />\nHendry, Humrichouse, Corner, Hill, E.

The whole<br />\nbuilding has been fitted with electric lights,<br />\nwhich should do away with two of the most<br />\nobjectionable features of last year. The daily<br />\nescape of gas in the gymnasium proper was<br />\nexceedingly annoying both to the instructors<br />\nand students, who were compelled to forego the<br />\npleasure of breathing exercises for fear of being<br />\nasphixiated. With electric lights there is no<br />\n<br />\nlonger any danger. Gas constantly lit in the<br />\nlocker room caused an unnecessary closeness of<br />\nthe atmosphere; even in cold weather the lockerroom air was not pure. In addition to the electric lights, a large new closet for foot-ball suits<br />\nand lacrosse sticks has been placed in the wrestling room, and a new entrance to the cage has<br />\nbeen made. The cage itself has been plowed,and<br />\nthe excess of brick and rocks removed. The gym.<br />\nhas been repainted and varnished for the especial use of the Freshmen.

We had spent the<br />\nearlier hours of the August afternoon loitering<br />\nabout the old abbey ruin of Glastonbury, which<br />\nlay dreaming in summer quiet so perfect that one<br />\ncould easily believe this was indeed the\"island<br />\nvalley of Avilion,\"<br />\n\"Where falls not rain or hail, or any snow,<br />\nNor ever wind blows loudly.\"<br />\nThence we had wheeled over the high road that<br />\nskirts the field of Sedgemoor, and on through<br />\nthe sleepy town of Bridgewater, so that it was<br />\nnow past sundown when we coasted down a<br />\ngentle hill, under over-archin trees, and entered<br />\nNether Stowev.<br />\nThe group of stone cottages that make up the<br />\nk and d reary;<br />\ntiny village looked somew hat blan<br />\nbut they are nestled cosilY into a hollow, and a<br />\nbright stream of water runs leisurely down<br />\nthrough the main street. The whole country<br />\nthereabout is soft and green, with groves and<br />\nlazy brooks, the ground falling now into little<br />\nvalleys and then rising again int() easy sloping<br />\nhills, that a mile or so eastward run up to a<br />\nhigher elevation,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"Smooth Quantock's airy ridge,\"<br />\nof<br />\nscreech<br />\nThe<br />\nsea.<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nsight<br />\nwhence you get<br />\nthis<br />\nthe locomotive has never yet been heard in<br />\nd<br />\nunchange<br />\nstand<br />\nthings<br />\nall<br />\nand<br />\npastoral region,<br />\nago.<br />\nyears<br />\nhundred<br />\na<br />\nas they were<br />\nof<br />\nWe were taking our wheels into the yard<br />\nwith<br />\nus<br />\ninformed<br />\nhost<br />\nthe<br />\nwhen<br />\ninn,<br />\nthe village<br />\nassurances of regret that he was \"full up,\" and<br />\ncould not possibly lodge us.

His wife, moreover, be said had gone<br /><br />\nNo. 1.<br /><br />\n_<br />\nto a flower show some miles away, and in the<br />\nabsence of \"The Missus,\" supper was an uncertain quantity ; but some one might be found to<br />\nget us a bit of baeon. Meantime, we started<br />\nout at once to find the object of our visit before<br />\nthe long twilight should darken into night.<br />\nAt the end of the street we found it\u2014the last<br />\ncottage but one before the street runs out into<br />\nthe open fields. A small square cottage, with a<br />\nneglected and lonesome look, its door opening<br />\ndirectly upon the roadside. But cheerless as it<br />\nlooks now, and cheerless as it must have been to<br />\noutward looks a hundred years ago, there is<br />\nperhaps hardly a roof in England under which<br />\nthere has been truer cheer or nobler thinking.<br />\nFor this is the humble cottage of Toni Poole to<br />\nwhich came in the last days of 1797 Samuel<br />\nTaylor Coleridge, to -take up his abode, determined to live thriftily and to devote himself to<br />\nagriculture and literature. \"We want but<br />\nthree rooms,\" he wrote Poole;and by dismissing<br />\nhis servant, practicing rigid economy, and<br />\nabstaining from animal food, he is confident that<br />\nhe can sustain himself, his wife and child, on sixteen shillings a week. In the day-time he will<br />\ngive himself, body and soul, to the garden ; in<br />\nthe evenings, to literature. The agriculture, of<br />\ncourse, did not thrive; but the literature did.<br />\nIt was in this little cottage that most of \"The<br />\nRime of the Ancient Mariner,\" and of the first<br />\npart of \"Christabel\" were written. It was sitting by the fireside in this tiny room that he<br />\nwrote those exquisite lines, Frost at Midnight,<br />\nwhile at his side his \"cradled infant slumbered<br />\npeacefully.\" It was in the little parlor that<br />\nWilliam and Dorothy Wordsworth paid their<br />\nfirst visit to him, and afterward talked many a<br />\ntime far into the night. It was here, during this<br />\nvisit of the Wordsworths, that Charles Lamb,<br />\ntoo, came to visit his earliest and best friend;<br />\nand in the room upstairs, Coleridge, detained at<br />\nhome by illness while his friends were roaming<br />\nover the Quantock hills, wrote that touching<br />\ntribute to his friend, \"The Lime Tree Bower My<br />\nPrison \"\u2014verses which he recalled with mourn<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n_<br /><br />\nful longings only a few weeks before he died.<br />\nThis little cottage was the shrine of William<br />\nHazlitt's pilgrimage, and here he passed three<br />\nhappy weeks, sitting through the long summer<br />\nafternoons in the arbor in the back garden or<br />\nunder the elm trees, \"listening to the bees bumming around us while we quaffed our flip.\" It<br />\nwas here that the fussy little Bristol bookseller<br />\ncame to see the young poet, and in the arbor<br />\nstruck the bargain for publishing that volume<br />\nwhich began the new poetry in England\u2014Lyrcal Ballads.<br />\nA plain tablet has been affixed to the front wall<br />\nof the cottage, informing the passer-by that the<br />\npoet-philosoper once dwelt here; and the weary<br />\nlooking little woman who now tenants it had<br />\nheard of the great Mr. Coleridge, and showed us<br />\nthe room\u2014the left-hand one,up the stair\u2014where<br />\n\"they say he used to sit and write.\" Sometimes<br />\nshe had one or two lodgers, she said, mostly<br />\ncity folk who wanted a bit of outing at little<br />\ncost; but very few people ever came to ask anything about Mr. Coleridge. She supposed he<br />\nwas there a great while ago, and most people<br />\nhad forgotten about it. The four rooms that<br />\nColeridge and his family occupied can have<br />\nchanged but little since he was here; but they<br />\nwere frowsy and uninviting. The garden behind the cottage has been divided and most of it<br />\nsold; the arbor and the trees are gone. The<br />\nwhole place had a rueful look, and it was bard<br />\nfor us to people it with the forms that once held<br />\nconverse there. As we left the garden in the<br />\ndusk and passed through the cottage again to<br />\nthe street, the bare rooms reminded me most,not<br />\nof that glad summer of 1798, but of that next<br />\nwinter, when Coleridge was in Germany, and<br />\npoor Sara Coleridge watched here through<br />\nmournful days and nights alone by the cradle of<br />\nher dying baby, and cried out, at last, that she<br />\ncould stay in this place no longer.<br />\nNext morning we visited a fairer shrine. After<br />\na night's sound sleep in the tidy attic of the<br />\ncarter's house and an excellent breakfast which<br />\n\"the Missus\" insisted on serving with her own<br />\nhands, we rode over to Alfoxden House, where<br />\nWordsworth lived in that annus mirabllis,179798. The poets used to say it was a walk of only<br />\nthree miles; our prosaic cyclometers made it<br /><br />\nnearly five. But the last mile and a-half of the<br />\nway lay through that park and wood which is<br />\nconsecrated by such frequent poetic mention.<br />\nThis is the walk that young Hazlitt took<br />\n\"through echoing grove, by fairy stream and<br />\nwaterfall, glimmering in the summer moonlight,\" while all the while the orphic voice of<br />\nColeridge by his side sounded high<br />\n\"Of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate.\"<br /><br />\nIt was along this path that Coleridge and<br />\nWordsworth walked a hundred times together;<br />\nit was in a glade by the brook here that Coleridge exclaimed one morning, \"This is a place to<br />\nreconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of<br />\nthe world \"; it was in these trees that the nightingales sang all that spring, and sing forever in<br />\nColeridge's verse. In this park lived the old<br />\nhuntsman, Simon Lee, and it was here that<br />\nwordsworth wrote the Night Piece, and the<br />\nLines in Early Spring, and Expostulation and<br />\nReply. The walk can have changed little since<br />\nthen, for the forest is old and has been carefully<br />\npreserved; the stream still skips and sings, and<br />\n\"'Twill murmur on a thousand years,<br />\nAnd flow as now it flows.\"<br /><br />\nThe house, too, though slightly enlarged, can<br />\nhardly have been altered much since Wordsworth<br />\nand Dorothywere here; Dorothy's description ofit<br />\nin her delightful journal might have been written<br />\nyesterday. It stands solid,almost stately,fronting the south,at thefoot ofa smooth hill that rises<br />\nalmost from the very door, still \"topped with<br />\nfern and sprinkled with trees,\" as when Dorothy looked out upon it. To the west a growth<br />\nof young wood has shut out the view of the sea<br />\nshe says she had; but otherwise we see to-day<br />\nwhat Dorothy saw.<br />\nWe were fortunate in the time of our visit, as<br />\nthe house was occupied only by a care-taker,and<br />\na note to him from our host of the Stowey Inn<br />\ngained us permission to look about it as we<br />\nchose. Here was the chamber in which Hazlitt<br />\nslept on the night of his stay at Alfoxden,and in<br />\nthe morning from his window that looked upon<br />\nthe hill, \"heard the loud stag speak.\" Here in<br />\nDorothy's sitting-room a climbing rose had<br />\nthrust a spray of blossoms in at the open window where she used to sit. But after all it was<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nmost pleasant to lie upon the turf outside, under<br />\nthe same great elms that shadowed the poet in<br />\ntheir youth a century ago, repeat his verses,and<br />\nread once more Dorothy's charming Journal.<br />\nWe lingered here till noon, letting the scene photograph itself in our memory, and then we rode<br />\non, over the Quantocks, past Kilve church\u2014<br />\nwhere \"there is no weather-cock \"\u2014to Porlock.<br />\nIn this most picturesque of all English villages,<br />\nhidden in one of the bowery clefts that break the<br />\nhigh line of the Devon coast, we saw the very<br />\n\"man from Porlock\" that disturbed the vision<br />\nof Kubla Khan; we\u2014but that is another story.<br />\nC.

I decided at first to clip and<br />\ninsert the many and interesting articles written<br />\nby earlier editors upon these two absorbing<br />\ntopics. As however the amount of such matter<br />\nwould probably fill several folio volumes, I shall<br />\nendeavor to give merely the barest gist of the<br />\nthing.<br />\nThe NEws-LETTHR should be subscribed and<br />\ncontributed to by the student body for the following cogent reasons: It is a college institution of undoubted worth and long standing,<br />\ncountenanced by the fitculty and the dean. It<br />\nis the only official organ through which the<br />\nstudents may vent their opinions, cry their<br />\nwrongs, glory in their victories, and efferverse<br />\nin verse by the aid of its masterly and powerful<br />\ncolumns, they can do all these things in plain<br />\nprint and receive that respectful attention which<br />\ncan be assured only by the weight (the moral<br />\nweight) of a free, conservative, and carefully<br />\nedited paper, which has during years of right<br />\nliving gained the respect and confidence of successive generations of subscribers. There, now.<br />\nThe importance of an effective foot-ball scrub<br />\nis too obvious to be dwelt upon at length. The<br />\nScrub gives the Varsity Eleven practice which<br /><br />\nThe band of Hopkins \"rooters\" that assembled at Union Park to witness the J. H.

Our correspondent is all right ; THE NEws-LETTER ought<br />\nto be improved. We have two or three ideas<br />\nalong that line ourselves. His motto, however,<br />\nis now nailed to the top of oureditorial desk and<br />\nis a source of considerable inspiration to us.<br />\nJuniors and Seniors will read this letter with a<br />\ngood deal of satisfaction. We hope they will<br />\nfall in with its\"spirits.\" There is also a modest<br />\nsuggestion to the faculty.<br />\nDear Mr. Editor: I have not been at Hopkins<br />\nvery long, but I am very full of Hopkins spirits,<br />\nand I want to write something for THE NEWSLETTER right off. I think everybody ought to<br />\nwrite for THE NEWS LETTER and help to make<br /><br />\ntoalltet:<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nit better. I read once that \"Improvement is<br />\nthe order of the age.\" I am a firm believer in<br />\ncollege spirits. We ought to have more at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nNow, to make a practical suggestion, I think<br />\nif the junior class, since we do not have any<br />\nmore hazing, if they would give some kind of a<br />\nreception or \"feed\" to the freshmen and tell<br />\nthem all about things and how to yell and<br />\nwhat to do at the games it would be a good<br />\nthing. The seniors might also do this. And<br />\nthen the professors ought to buy tickets for the<br />\ngames.<br />\nAnother good thing for college spirits is to<br />\nwear a Hopkins pin. I have one I wear every<br />\nday and it attracts a great deal of attention.<br />\nYou see the better your college is known the<br />\nmore men come to it and you can have bigger<br />\nteams. In this way we could get into the class<br />\nwith Yale and Harvard and other big schools.<br />\nI am a firm believer in pins.<br />\nLastly I think every fellow ought to work<br />\nhard at his studies and to raise the standard of<br />\nhis institution. This has more to do with college spirits than you would at first think for it<br />\nwould bring a better class of men to your college and there would be more spirits. I do not<br />\nthink it is good to drink or smoke cigarettes<br />\nwhile you are studying, though I once knew a<br />\nfellow who got a scholarship and drank a good<br />\ndeal of beer. (It was at another college). It is<br />\nalso very bad for the teams,for you cannot play<br />\nfoot-ball and drink beer at the same time.

There<br />\nwere many serious predictions for the future of<br />\nthe clubs At the close of last year, for a large<br />\nnumber of the members would not be here this<br />\nyear to aid in making things joyful or otherwise.<br />\nBut as most other storm clouds, these rumors<br />\npassed off after a little noise as quietly as they<br />\nhad come and now everything points to a most<br />\npromising year with as good if not better clubs<br />\nthan formerly. Of course there have been serious<br />\nlosses both in men and leaders, but even now<br />\nwith the loss of I. A.Thorson, leader of the Mandolin Club, and Girvin Peters, leader of the Glee<br />\nClub, the musical clubs are not as badly off as<br />\nthey were at the beginning of last year. For<br />\nthen there was no one who would undertake to<br />\nlead the Banjo Club. Peters was not sure<br />\nwhether he would have time for the Glee Club,<br />\nand Vogeler was compelled to resign his leadership of the Mandolin Club immediately after it<br />\nhad gotten into good shape. But now all three<br />\nclubs have leaders and every member takes a<br />\nlively interest in the welfare of the clubs. One<br />\nother thing that points to success is that Manager Bird has made the very best contract that<br />\nthe clubs have ever made with Mr. Fisher, by<br />\nwhich he will give the Glee Club a larger proportion of his time than usual.<br />\nThe men who have been received as candidates<br />\nfor the clubs up to date include: Wolf, Nelson,<br />\nHendry, Humrichouse, Corner, Hill, E.

The whole<br />\nbuilding has been fitted with electric lights,<br />\nwhich should do away with two of the most<br />\nobjectionable features of last year. The daily<br />\nescape of gas in the gymnasium proper was<br />\nexceedingly annoying both to the instructors<br />\nand students, who were compelled to forego the<br />\npleasure of breathing exercises for fear of being<br />\nasphixiated. With electric lights there is no<br /><br />\nlonger any danger. Gas constantly lit in the<br />\nlocker room caused an unnecessary closeness of<br />\nthe atmosphere; even in cold weather the lockerroom air was not pure. In addition to the electric lights, a large new closet for foot-ball suits<br />\nand lacrosse sticks has been placed in the wrestling room, and a new entrance to the cage has<br />\nbeen made. The cage itself has been plowed,and<br />\nthe excess of brick and rocks removed. The gym.<br />\nhas been repainted and varnished for the especial use of the Freshmen.
