XIX, NO. 29.<br />\n\"MODERN EDUCATIONAL IDEALS\"<br />\nThe Inaugural Address of Frank Johnson<br />\nGoodnow, the Third President of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\n<br />\nThe complaint is often made that<br />\nmodern education is too practical in<br />\nits aims, and that as a consequence<br />\nthe coming generation will lose<br />\nmuch of the beauty and richness of<br />\nlife which those of the present owe<br />\nto their pursuit in past years of<br />\nwhat are usually called cultural as<br />\nopposed to vocational studies. I am<br />\ntoday going to discuss the question whether this complaint is justified. '<br />\nIn attempting such a discussion it<br />\nis necessary to distinguish between<br />\nthe aims of those seeking an education and the character of the education which is offered.<br />\nIf we make this distinction, do<br />\nwe as a matter of fact find that the<br />\naims of those seeking a modern<br />\neducation are in any way more<br />\npractical than were the aims of<br />\nthose who in the good old days<br />\nsought to acquire the knowledge<br />\nthen available?<br />\nAn examination of the history of<br />\nuniversities and of such institutions<br />\nof learning as antedated them would<br />\nseem to show that almost everywhere and at almost every period<br />\nthe primary purpose of those seeking an education has been in very<br />\nlarge measure a distinctly practical<br />\none. This purpose has been to acquire proficiency in the profession<br />\nwhich they intended to follow. European education has always been<br />\ndevoted to the study of those things<br />\nwhich were believed from age to<br />\nage to be of definite use to the student at the close of his period of<br />\nstudy. It has lost this vocational<br />\ncharacter at any particular time<br />\nonly in so far as there have been<br />\nretained by tradition among the<br />\nsubjects in which systematic instruction has been given those subjects which have ceased to be of<br />\npractical value, or as attention has<br />\nnot been devoted to new subjects<br />\nwhich because of changed conditions have come to have practical<br />\nvalue.<br />\nIn the early history of education<br />\nin Europe the only learned profession, that is an occupation for which<br />\na serious and systematic education<br />\nwas universally offered, was the<br />\nclerical profession. In the church<br />\nschools appearing in the days of<br />\nCharlemagne, which were almost<br />\nthe only educational institutions existing in Europe prior to the establishment of the University, was<br />\ngiven that instruction in somewhat<br />\ntheological and philosophical subjects which was supposed to fit men<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 1)<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAY<br />\n<br />\n21, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nDR.

Not only<br />\nwere the undergraduates well represented as ushers, or in other<br />\nminor capacities, but the circumstantial white trousers and windsor<br />\ntie were worn by many who were<br />\nseated with the general public, but<br />\ntook this means of showing their<br />\nloyalty and their interest in the exercises.

Presi-<br />\n<br />\ndent-Emeritus Remsen then presented President-elect Goodnow to<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, represented<br />\nin the person of its chairman, Mr.<br />\nR. Brent Keyser.

In a<br />\ncollege no serious harm results if<br />\nthe great percentage of the books<br />\nare housed in a closed stack, if<br />\nthere is a good selection from all<br />\nfields of knowledge placed in a<br />\nlarge reading-room; but when work<br />\nof investigation is to be carried on,<br />\nit is most important that student<br />\nand professor have ready access to<br />\nall the materials of the subject<br />\nwhich the University possesses. To<br />\naccomplish this and yet maintain<br />\neffective and economical administrative control presents a very difficult problem. It is the solution of<br />\nthis problem, worked out by Librarian M. L. Raney, which is winning laurels for the new Hopkins<br />\nsystem.<br />\nThese plans, with descriptive exposition in English and German,<br />\nwere shown as a part of the University library exhibit at the Internationale Ausstellung fur Buchgewerbe und Graphik, held at Leipzig<br />\nlast year. The curators of the<br />\nAmerican exhibit report that our<br />\nplans were received enthusiastically<br />\nin Germany, and detailed explanation of them repeatedly asked. This<br />\nexhibit has been shipped to San<br />\nFrancisco, and will be seen there<br />\nduring the exposition.<br />\nThe references to this building<br />\nin library literature are frequent<br />\nand complimentary. In the current<br />\nissue of the Library Journal, which<br />\nis given up to university libraries,<br />\nthere is the following editorial immediately after a reference to the<br />\nnew Harvard memorial library:<br />\n\"The new library of Johns Hopkins University, at Homewood, in<br />\nBaltimore, even more strikingly illustrates the central position of the<br />\nmodern university library. Gilman<br />\nHall, which is the library building,<br />\nthe name being in memoriam of the<br />\nfirst president of the University, is<br />\nthe dominant architectural feature<br />\nof the whole University plan, occupying the most conspicuous place in<br />\nthe perspective and communicating<br />\nwith the other buildings of the main<br />\nquadrangle, when they come to be<br />\nbuilt, through corridor wings. This<br />\nbuilding, illustrated in the Library<br />\nJournal, November, 1913, was<br />\nplanned with the administrative<br />\nneeds of a University library as the<br />\nguiding thought; and thus both<br />\narchitecturally and administratively<br />\nexemplifies the modern University<br />\nas a collection of special schools,<br />\neach with its departmental library,<br />\nbut all the libraries co-ordinated<br />\nwithin a central building. As new<br />\nUniversity libraries are planned in<br />\nthe future they will probably follow<br />\nsome such type as that so splendidly<br />\nworked out at Johns Hopkins.\"<br />\nOur advertisers make possible<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE BATTLE TOMORROW<br />\nWILL WIND UP GREAT SEASON<br />\n<br />\nThe game with the University of<br />\nToronto at Homewood tomorrow,<br />\nwill bring to a close a most successful lacrosse season. Whether<br />\nHopkins wins or loses, the 1915<br />\nteam will have made a record that<br />\nwill go down in history.<br />\nThis particular lacrosse season<br />\nwill be remembered for various<br />\nreasons. In the first place, under<br />\nthe leadership of Captain Troxell,<br />\nthe 'Varsity twelve has brought<br />\nback to Hopkins the championship<br />\nof the Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nLeague of America. The contest<br />\ntomorrow will give followers of the<br />\ngame an idea of what the Black<br />\nand Blue can do against the Canadians, the chief exponents of this<br />\nform of pastime; and will involve<br />\ninternational honors, inasmuch as<br />\nthe University of Toronto is considered to have the best lacrosse<br />\ntwelve in Canada.<br />\nBut what is more, the 'Varsity<br />\nhas gone through the entire season<br />\nwithout suffering a defeat, although<br />\nCarlisle was played to a tie.<br />\nPaul Sutton will captain the<br />\n'Varsity twelve next year. He will<br />\nbe supported by the same team that<br />\nrepresents Hopkins this year, except for Troxell and Huck. Although the loss of these two stars<br />\nis much to be regretted, it is thought<br />\nthat FIopkins will be able to make<br />\nan unusually strong bid toward the<br />\n1916 banner.<br />\nThe contest tomorrow probably<br />\nwill give the Hopkins twelve the<br />\nhardest battle of the season. The<br />\nBlack and Blue, however, vill put<br />\nup a strong fight and is considered<br />\nto have a good chance of winning.<br />\nThe regular 'Varsity team will<br />\nstart the contest, but if occasion requires several alumni may be substituted.<br />\n<br />\nSIGNS<br />\n<br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br />\n<br />\nJAS.

He has taken his place in the<br />\nranks of University presidents; the<br />\ntraditions of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity are his to uphold and to<br />\nmake greater.<br />\nNo executive was ever more<br />\nneeded than is Dr. Goodnow. Few<br />\nweightier tasks have faced a University president than those which<br />\nare now given to Hopkins' new<br />\nchief to accomplish. He was called<br />\nto his present place because of his<br />\nknown ability and energy. But all<br />\nhis former achievements will lose<br />\ntheir significance and be overshadowed if he does the seemingly impossible\u2014moves the University to a<br />\ncompleted Homewood.<br />\nMoney is needed\u2014millions of dollar. State sources and private<br />\nsources have been exhausted in recent years. The great educational<br />\nfoundations willingly lavish money<br />\non the Medical School\u2014but studiously avoid the other departments.<br />\nOur alumni are not rich men. Most<br />\nof them are scholars, or engaged in<br />\nsome educational field. The procuring of funds has baffled the University for years. Thus, it will require every ounce of vigor, determination and ability on the part of<br />\nthe president to raise a great new<br />\nendowment. That he will be able<br />\nto carry through a successful financial campaign is the earnest wish of<br />\nevery friend of the University. If<br />\nhe is able to do this, to him will<br />\nbelong the credit. As truly as<br />\nDaniel C.

Several classes of alumni will march<br />\nto the grounds with bands, and four<br />\nflags\u2014the flag of Maryland, the flag<br />\nof Baltimore, the flag of Hopkins,<br />\nand the flag of the United States\u2014<br />\nwill be raised, one at each corner<br />\nof the field.

Roach,<br />\nJacobsen, Taylor and Strobel, all of<br />\nthem freshmen, have shown remarkably good form, and played<br />\nconsistent tennis all season. Perhaps the steadiest and most skillful<br />\nof these men is Roach, who can be<br />\nthoroughly relied upon by his teammates. Morgan played his usual<br />\ngood game this spring, but was<br />\nslightly out of condition.<br />\nHammond also lived up to his<br />\nreputation, and played a fast, aggressive game. Taylor should be<br />\nranked among the best players next<br />\nyear, if he continues to improve.<br />\nHe is a left-hander, and his swift<br />\nvolleys always make his opponents<br />\nhustle.<br />\nJacobsen is another coming champion, whose lack of experience<br />\nslightly handicapped him this year.<br />\nHe has a good tennis head, and<br />\nplays a steady, tireless game. McLean plays a conservative defensive<br />\ngame, which is nerve-racking to an<br />\nopponent. This player has had a<br />\nlot of experience and proved himself a bulwark to the team.<br />\nLehigh, Swarthmore, Georgetown and St. John's have all been<br />\ntaken into camp by the tennis team,<br />\nwhile Princeton, Pennsylvania and<br />\nHaverford have won only after<br />\nhard fighting.

The higher<br />\nclergy were for many years for all<br />\npractical purposes the only educated<br />\nclass in the community. it was<br />\nlargely on that account that the<br />\nposition of the clergy, as a whole<br />\nwas so important. Members of tins<br />\nclass were, because of the intellectual and moral influence of the<br />\nChristian church, the molders of<br />\nsuch public opinion as then existed.<br />\nlhey were, also, practically the only<br />\nliterary men of the day. litom their<br />\nranks, finally, emerged many if not<br />\nmost of the politicians and statesmen who influenced and assisted<br />\nkings and princes and guided the<br />\ndestinies of states.<br />\nThe other occupations, some .of<br />\nwhich have since attained the dignity of learned professions, were in<br />\nformer days days trades rather than<br />\nprofessions. Entrance to them was<br />\nthe result of practical training<br />\nrather than of systematic instruction. Indeed in many lines of work<br />\nthe system of apprenticeship was<br />\ntile only form of education available. Sometimes those engaged in<br />\nthese occupations formed themselves<br />\ninto societies organized after the<br />\nmanner of the merchant and craft<br />\nguilds which had so much influence<br />\non commerce and industry. As a<br />\nresult both of association with their<br />\nfellows and of instruction received<br />\nfrom their superiors the younger<br />\nmembers of these societies acquired<br />\na knowledge, usually empirical in<br />\ncharacter, of the secrets of the<br />\ncraft or mystery of which they intended to devote their lives. Such,<br />\nfor example, in England; were the<br />\nInns of Court organized by the lawyers, and the College of Physicians<br />\nand Surgeons which looked after<br />\nthe interests of those engaged in<br />\nthe practice of medicine.<br />\nDuring the second half of what<br />\nare called the Middle Ages universities were established. In them<br />\nmore or less systematic instruction<br />\nwas given in subjects which had<br />\nnot before the establishment of the<br />\nuniversities been regarded as<br />\nworthy of the attention of the<br />\nlearned, i. e. the \"educated,\" man.<br />\nTo theology and philosophy, which<br />\nhad constituted about all the learning of the day, was added very<br />\ngenerally the study of law and<br />\nmedicine. The study of law first<br />\nappears at Bologna, that of medicine at Salerno, in both cases before the establishment of the universities; but these subjects from a<br />\nvery early time found a place in the<br />\nuniversity. In England, however,<br />\nlaw and medicine did not succeed<br />\nin obtaining an important position<br />\nin the educational system. The<br />\nInns of Court and the College of<br />\nPhysicians and Surgeons gave most<br />\nof the legal and medical instruction<br />\nwhich was given. The universities,<br />\nnevertheless, exerted an influence<br />\non the development of both legal<br />\nand medical study. For instruction<br />\nin. theology and philosophy, which<br />\nmight have a bearing on the solu-<br />\n<br />\ntion of legal problems, was often<br />\ngiven in the university to individuals who subsequently studied law<br />\nas a trade in the Inns of Court;<br />\nand although the study of medicine<br />\nwas in England carried on for the<br />\nmost part in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, there was still<br />\nin Oxford at any rate from a very<br />\n:.tarly time a professorship of medicine. Students of medicine who<br />\nwere not satisfied with the facilities<br />\noffered in England went, however\u2014<br />\nand in considerable numbers\u2014to the<br />\nContinent for instruction.<br />\nThe function of the early English university was, therefore, in<br />\nlarge measure, to prepare merely<br />\nfor the clerical profession, and it<br />\nmay be said that the English university has not even at the present<br />\ntime entirely emancipated itself<br />\nfrom the clerical and monastic influences to which it was for so long<br />\na time subject.<br />\nThe revival of learning had the<br />\neffect of changing and broadening<br />\nthe work of universities. Systematic instruction was given in a<br />\ngreater number of subjects than before had been the case, particularly<br />\nin the Greek and Latin classics.<br />\nThe aims of those who sought this<br />\ninstruction were, however, almost if<br />\nnot every bit as practical as in the<br />\npast. Most men went to the university in order to fit themselves<br />\nfor their chosen career. There<br />\nwere, however, more learned professions than formerly. One could<br />\nthus be a literary man without being a clergyman. The development<br />\nof the secular statesman, which was<br />\nlargely incidental to the systematic<br />\nstudy of law, also lessened the influence of the clergy in political<br />\naffairs. But for a long time after<br />\nthe first appearance of a secular<br />\nstatesman it was almost necessary<br />\nthat a candidate for political honors<br />\nshould be well versed in what was<br />\nconsidered to be the learning of the<br />\nday. In England, for example, until a comparatively late date a successful and persuasive speech in<br />\nParliament must be replete with<br />\nclassical references and abound in<br />\nquotations from Latin authors who<br />\nwere considered almost to monopolize polite literature.<br />\nThe result was then both in England and on the Continent that,<br />\neven during the period when classical learning cast its most potent<br />\nspell on the European mind, those<br />\nwho studied in the universities were<br />\nactuated by the desire to fit themselves for some specified career.<br />\nThe candidates for the clerical profession, for the legal and medical<br />\nprofessions, and for political honors,<br />\nwent to the university to pursue<br />\nwhat were often regarded as and<br />\nusually were vocational studies.<br />\nThey did not flock to the spring of<br />\nknowledge to quench a thirst for<br />\nlearning. They drank of the waters<br />\nrather to strengthen themselves for<br />\nthe race of life in Nvhich they had<br />\nentered.<br />\nA distinct development of the<br />\nstudy of theology and philosophy in<br />\nthe early days of European education was that phase of European in-<br />\n<br />\ntellectual life which is known as<br />\nScholasticism. Scholasticism is of<br />\ncourse associated at the present<br />\ntime with almost anything but the<br />\npractical and the useful. The determination of the number of angels that can dance on the point of<br />\na needle, or of the action of the<br />\nhistoric ass placed between two<br />\nbundles of hay, does not seem now<br />\nto be of great practical value; but<br />\nit may not be denied that the answer to these questions was considered in former days to be of fundamental importance. The later study<br />\nof the Greco-Latin classics had<br />\nsomewhat the same influence on<br />\nEuropean intellectual development<br />\nwhich the study of the Chinese<br />\nclassics has apparently had on<br />\nChinese life. It aroused a great admiration for the past and somewhat<br />\nof a contempt for the present. At<br />\nthe same time a knowledge of the<br />\nGreek and Latin classics had, at<br />\none time, great practical value.<br />\nEven now'it has such a value. Almost all modern European languages owe much to Greek and<br />\nLatin, and books of even the present<br />\nday are replete with classical allusions which can with difficulty be<br />\nunderstood by those who have not<br />\nhad a classical training.<br />\nWhat was true of the mediaeval<br />\nschools and of the early universities was nearly as true of the later<br />\nuniversity development. Most students who have entered the portals<br />\nof the university have done so in<br />\norder to carry on vocational studies,<br />\nthat is, in order to make themselves<br />\nmore effective in their subsequent<br />\ncareers. The sphere of activity of<br />\nthe universities has continued, however, to enlarge through bringing<br />\nwithin the reach of their influence<br />\nother occupations which had been<br />\nregarded at one time in the nature<br />\nof trades, but which began to take<br />\non the character of learned professions, and preparations for those<br />\nprofessions has always been one of<br />\nthe most important functions of the<br />\nuniversity. The existing organization of the normal continental university shows clearly its practical<br />\nor vocational character at the present time. That organization is<br />\nbased upon four rather separate and<br />\ndistinct faculties. These are the<br />\nfaculties of theology, philosophy,<br />\nlaw and medicine. Of these all but<br />\nthe faculty of philosophy fit the student for a recognized learned profession. The only one that may not<br />\nbe said to be clearly practical in its<br />\naims is the faculty of philosophy.<br />\nTo this faculty are assigned all the<br />\nsubjects which do not find a place<br />\nin one of the others. But because<br />\nit is not the place of preparation<br />\nfor a recognized learned profession<br />\nwe must not suppose that the aims<br />\nof the faculty of philosophy are<br />\naltogether unpractical. For within<br />\nits jurisdiction are philosophy, history, literature and the 'natural and<br />\npolitical sciences, which usually occupy such an important place in the<br />\nsystem of education adopted in the<br />\nlower schools. It is to the faculty<br />\nof philosophy to which is entrusted<br />\nthe training of teachers in those<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\nsubjects. Most of the students even<br />\nof the faculty of philosophy are<br />\nthus practical in their aims. For<br />\nthey are endeavoring to fit themselves for their life work of teaching.<br />\nOne of the first if not the first of<br />\nthe new professions which was<br />\nrecognized by the early university<br />\nwas medicine. The advance of<br />\nmedicine to its new dignity was in<br />\nlarge measure due to a change of<br />\nEuropean thought. it may be said<br />\nthat for a considerable period prior<br />\nto the revival of learning European<br />\nthought was in the main like the<br />\nthought of most other parts of the<br />\nworld, theoretical and speculative.<br />\nIt laid great stress on supernatural<br />\ncauses for the ordinary phenomena<br />\nof life and emphasized dialectic and<br />\na priori deductions from assumed<br />\npremises.<br />\nintellectual curiosity<br />\nwith regard to life was satisfied by<br />\nmeditation and speculation rather<br />\nthan by investigation and experimentation. Men , thought rather<br />\nthan observed; reasoned rather than<br />\ngeneralized.<br />\nThis attitude was not always,<br />\nhowever, the attitude of the European mind. Early in the history of<br />\nEuropean thought there had been<br />\nattempts made to observe, to gather<br />\ndata, to generalize inductively from<br />\nthese data and by the process of experimentation to limit the effects of<br />\nthe generalizations made. Aristotle<br />\nand Archimedes, Hippocrates and<br />\nGalen were among the men to<br />\nwhom observation seemed important, who sought by induction to<br />\nreach conclusions and by experiment to test the tentative conclusions reached.<br />\nThis early attempt to elaborate a<br />\nscientific rather than a speculative<br />\nmethod of treating the phenomena<br />\nof life was, however, abandoned.<br />\nThe cause of its abandonment is not<br />\nknown. Changes in general social<br />\nand economic conditions must probably be held in large measure responsible. But it is also just as<br />\ntrue that Europe was being increasingly subjected to Asiatic political<br />\nand intellectual influences. The<br />\nconquests of Alexander the Great,<br />\nalthough usually regarded as the<br />\ntriumph of Europe over Asia, also<br />\nresulted in the subjection of Europe, or at any rate of that part of<br />\nEurope which counted intellectually, to certain Asiatic influences.<br />\nIn the same way the expansion of<br />\nRome somewhat later had perhaps<br />\nas much influence in bringing Asia<br />\nto Europe as in causing the spread<br />\nin Asia of European methods of<br />\nthought. The jus gentium brought<br />\nin by the Roman Prxtor originated<br />\nin large measure in Asia. The<br />\nAsiatic principle of autocratic rule<br />\nreplaced the first feeble attempts at<br />\npopular government made in Greece<br />\nand Rome.<br />\nAt about the same time that these<br />\nlegal and political principles originating in Asia became predominant<br />\nin Europe, other important intellectual and moral ideas also of Asiatic origin made their influence felt<br />\nthere as well. These were the two<br />\ngreat Asiatic religions, that of<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, MAY 21, 1914.<br />\n<br />\nMythra and Christianity.

XIX, NO. 29.<br />\n\"MODERN EDUCATIONAL IDEALS\"<br />\nThe Inaugural Address of Frank Johnson<br />\nGoodnow, the Third President of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br /><br />\nThe complaint is often made that<br />\nmodern education is too practical in<br />\nits aims, and that as a consequence<br />\nthe coming generation will lose<br />\nmuch of the beauty and richness of<br />\nlife which those of the present owe<br />\nto their pursuit in past years of<br />\nwhat are usually called cultural as<br />\nopposed to vocational studies. I am<br />\ntoday going to discuss the question whether this complaint is justified. '<br />\nIn attempting such a discussion it<br />\nis necessary to distinguish between<br />\nthe aims of those seeking an education and the character of the education which is offered.<br />\nIf we make this distinction, do<br />\nwe as a matter of fact find that the<br />\naims of those seeking a modern<br />\neducation are in any way more<br />\npractical than were the aims of<br />\nthose who in the good old days<br />\nsought to acquire the knowledge<br />\nthen available?<br />\nAn examination of the history of<br />\nuniversities and of such institutions<br />\nof learning as antedated them would<br />\nseem to show that almost everywhere and at almost every period<br />\nthe primary purpose of those seeking an education has been in very<br />\nlarge measure a distinctly practical<br />\none. This purpose has been to acquire proficiency in the profession<br />\nwhich they intended to follow. European education has always been<br />\ndevoted to the study of those things<br />\nwhich were believed from age to<br />\nage to be of definite use to the student at the close of his period of<br />\nstudy. It has lost this vocational<br />\ncharacter at any particular time<br />\nonly in so far as there have been<br />\nretained by tradition among the<br />\nsubjects in which systematic instruction has been given those subjects which have ceased to be of<br />\npractical value, or as attention has<br />\nnot been devoted to new subjects<br />\nwhich because of changed conditions have come to have practical<br />\nvalue.<br />\nIn the early history of education<br />\nin Europe the only learned profession, that is an occupation for which<br />\na serious and systematic education<br />\nwas universally offered, was the<br />\nclerical profession. In the church<br />\nschools appearing in the days of<br />\nCharlemagne, which were almost<br />\nthe only educational institutions existing in Europe prior to the establishment of the University, was<br />\ngiven that instruction in somewhat<br />\ntheological and philosophical subjects which was supposed to fit men<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 1)<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAY<br /><br />\n21, 1915.<br /><br />\nDR.

GOODNOW INSTALLED<br />\nAS UNIVERSITY'S THIRD PRESIDENT<br />\nBrilliant Assembly of the Country's Greatest Educators and Citizens Gather to Celebrate With Johns Hopkins the<br />\nInauguration of Its New Executive.<br /><br />\nDr. Frank Johnson Goodnow was formally inaugurated as President<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University as half-past four o'clock yesterday<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe inauguration was preceded by a procession of the delegates<br />\nattending the exercises, faculties, trustees, alumni, and graduate and<br />\nmedical students.'<br />\nAfter an invocation by Bishop John Gardner Murray,of Maryland,<br />\nPresident-elect Goodnow was presented to the Board of Trustees by<br />\nPresident-emeritus Remsen and was given the charter of the University<br />\nand the key of the Carroll Mansion. President Goodnow then delivered<br />\nhis inaugural address, which is printed in another column.<br />\nThe occasion was in every way a<br />\nbrilliant one, and offered the best of<br />\ntestimony to the care and foresight<br />\nexercised by the Committee. on Arrangements. All who are connected with, or interested in, the<br />\nUniversity seem to have co-operated<br />\nto insure the proper carrying out of<br />\nthe official program. Not only<br />\nwere the undergraduates well represented as ushers, or in other<br />\nminor capacities, but the circumstantial white trousers and windsor<br />\ntie were worn by many who were<br />\nseated with the general public, but<br />\ntook this means of showing their<br />\nloyalty and their interest in the exercises. The alumni were admirably represented, as was the public<br />\nof Baltimore at large.<br />\nThe exercises were formally<br />\nopened at 4.30 o'clock with an<br />\nAcademic procession, immediately<br />\npreceded by a procession of the<br />\nalumni and gradute and medical<br />\nstudents of the University.<br />\nDr. Murray Peabody Brush was<br />\nchief marshal of the procession.<br />\nThe procession began at the Engineering Building and proceeded<br />\nto the steps of the Academic Building, where the exercises proper<br />\nwere held.<br />\nThe ceremonies were opened with<br />\nan invocation by Bishop John Gardner Murray, of Maryland.. Presi-<br /><br />\ndent-Emeritus Remsen then presented President-elect Goodnow to<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, represented<br />\nin the person of its chairman, Mr.<br />\nR. Brent Keyser. The new official<br />\nwas presented with the Hopkins<br />\nCharter and the bastile key of the<br />\nCarroll Mansion, in token of his<br />\nposition of guardian of the spirit<br />\nand the material wealth of the University. President Goodnow then<br />\ndelivered his inaugural address, the<br />\nonly speech to mark the course of<br />\nthe exercises.<br />\nFollowing the inaugural address<br />\ncame the presentation of honorary<br />\ndegrees, which closed the ceremonies.<br />\nAt 9 o'clock on Thursday evening a reception was held in the<br />\nAcademic Building. The music for<br />\nthis occasion was furnished by<br />\nFisher's Orchestra\u2014for the inaugural exercises, by Feldmann's<br />\nBand.<br />\nBeginning with this autumn, all<br />\nfreshmen at Brown University will<br />\nbe required to take a one-hour<br />\ncourse dealing with \"the aim, scope<br />\nand value\" of a college education.<br />\nAbout one-fourth of the lectures<br />\nwill deal with the general relation<br />\nof the student to the University;<br />\nthe others with the academic curriculum.

In a<br />\ncollege no serious harm results if<br />\nthe great percentage of the books<br />\nare housed in a closed stack, if<br />\nthere is a good selection from all<br />\nfields of knowledge placed in a<br />\nlarge reading-room; but when work<br />\nof investigation is to be carried on,<br />\nit is most important that student<br />\nand professor have ready access to<br />\nall the materials of the subject<br />\nwhich the University possesses. To<br />\naccomplish this and yet maintain<br />\neffective and economical administrative control presents a very difficult problem. It is the solution of<br />\nthis problem, worked out by Librarian M. L. Raney, which is winning laurels for the new Hopkins<br />\nsystem.<br />\nThese plans, with descriptive exposition in English and German,<br />\nwere shown as a part of the University library exhibit at the Internationale Ausstellung fur Buchgewerbe und Graphik, held at Leipzig<br />\nlast year. The curators of the<br />\nAmerican exhibit report that our<br />\nplans were received enthusiastically<br />\nin Germany, and detailed explanation of them repeatedly asked. This<br />\nexhibit has been shipped to San<br />\nFrancisco, and will be seen there<br />\nduring the exposition.<br />\nThe references to this building<br />\nin library literature are frequent<br />\nand complimentary. In the current<br />\nissue of the Library Journal, which<br />\nis given up to university libraries,<br />\nthere is the following editorial immediately after a reference to the<br />\nnew Harvard memorial library:<br />\n\"The new library of Johns Hopkins University, at Homewood, in<br />\nBaltimore, even more strikingly illustrates the central position of the<br />\nmodern university library. Gilman<br />\nHall, which is the library building,<br />\nthe name being in memoriam of the<br />\nfirst president of the University, is<br />\nthe dominant architectural feature<br />\nof the whole University plan, occupying the most conspicuous place in<br />\nthe perspective and communicating<br />\nwith the other buildings of the main<br />\nquadrangle, when they come to be<br />\nbuilt, through corridor wings. This<br />\nbuilding, illustrated in the Library<br />\nJournal, November, 1913, was<br />\nplanned with the administrative<br />\nneeds of a University library as the<br />\nguiding thought; and thus both<br />\narchitecturally and administratively<br />\nexemplifies the modern University<br />\nas a collection of special schools,<br />\neach with its departmental library,<br />\nbut all the libraries co-ordinated<br />\nwithin a central building. As new<br />\nUniversity libraries are planned in<br />\nthe future they will probably follow<br />\nsome such type as that so splendidly<br />\nworked out at Johns Hopkins.\"<br />\nOur advertisers make possible<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nLACROSSE BATTLE TOMORROW<br />\nWILL WIND UP GREAT SEASON<br /><br />\nThe game with the University of<br />\nToronto at Homewood tomorrow,<br />\nwill bring to a close a most successful lacrosse season. Whether<br />\nHopkins wins or loses, the 1915<br />\nteam will have made a record that<br />\nwill go down in history.<br />\nThis particular lacrosse season<br />\nwill be remembered for various<br />\nreasons. In the first place, under<br />\nthe leadership of Captain Troxell,<br />\nthe 'Varsity twelve has brought<br />\nback to Hopkins the championship<br />\nof the Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nLeague of America. The contest<br />\ntomorrow will give followers of the<br />\ngame an idea of what the Black<br />\nand Blue can do against the Canadians, the chief exponents of this<br />\nform of pastime; and will involve<br />\ninternational honors, inasmuch as<br />\nthe University of Toronto is considered to have the best lacrosse<br />\ntwelve in Canada.<br />\nBut what is more, the 'Varsity<br />\nhas gone through the entire season<br />\nwithout suffering a defeat, although<br />\nCarlisle was played to a tie.<br />\nPaul Sutton will captain the<br />\n'Varsity twelve next year. He will<br />\nbe supported by the same team that<br />\nrepresents Hopkins this year, except for Troxell and Huck. Although the loss of these two stars<br />\nis much to be regretted, it is thought<br />\nthat FIopkins will be able to make<br />\nan unusually strong bid toward the<br />\n1916 banner.<br />\nThe contest tomorrow probably<br />\nwill give the Hopkins twelve the<br />\nhardest battle of the season. The<br />\nBlack and Blue, however, vill put<br />\nup a strong fight and is considered<br />\nto have a good chance of winning.<br />\nThe regular 'Varsity team will<br />\nstart the contest, but if occasion requires several alumni may be substituted.<br /><br />\nSIGNS<br /><br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br /><br />\nJAS.

He has taken his place in the<br />\nranks of University presidents; the<br />\ntraditions of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity are his to uphold and to<br />\nmake greater.<br />\nNo executive was ever more<br />\nneeded than is Dr. Goodnow. Few<br />\nweightier tasks have faced a University president than those which<br />\nare now given to Hopkins' new<br />\nchief to accomplish. He was called<br />\nto his present place because of his<br />\nknown ability and energy. But all<br />\nhis former achievements will lose<br />\ntheir significance and be overshadowed if he does the seemingly impossible\u2014moves the University to a<br />\ncompleted Homewood.<br />\nMoney is needed\u2014millions of dollar. State sources and private<br />\nsources have been exhausted in recent years. The great educational<br />\nfoundations willingly lavish money<br />\non the Medical School\u2014but studiously avoid the other departments.<br />\nOur alumni are not rich men. Most<br />\nof them are scholars, or engaged in<br />\nsome educational field. The procuring of funds has baffled the University for years. Thus, it will require every ounce of vigor, determination and ability on the part of<br />\nthe president to raise a great new<br />\nendowment. That he will be able<br />\nto carry through a successful financial campaign is the earnest wish of<br />\nevery friend of the University. If<br />\nhe is able to do this, to him will<br />\nbelong the credit. As truly as<br />\nDaniel C. Gilman was the father of<br />\nthe great old Johns Hopkins Uni-<br /><br />\nversity, President Goodnow will be<br />\nthe father of the greater new one.<br />\nThe man who has won the lasting esteem of the student body in<br />\nthe short space of a college year,<br />\nby his unaffected personal interest<br />\nin student activities; the man who<br />\nhas appreciated the needs of undergraduate life more sympathetically<br />\nin so brief a time than many others<br />\nwho have been here a decade\u2014he is<br />\nin a fair way to make May 20, 1915,<br />\na great date in Hopkins history.<br />\nHullabaloo to Be Out on Twenty-fifth.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSIR\u2014The attention of the public<br /><br />\nshould be called to the fact that<br />\nthe 1915 Hullabaloo will be put<br />\non sale on Tuesday, May 25; alsq,<br />\nthat the sale is to be limited to those<br />\nwho have subscribed efore the date<br />\nof publication.

From<br />\nthe manner of arranging views and<br />\nplans of the new Hopkins buildings<br />\nand inasmuch as this is the inaugural year of the University aft<br />\nHomewood, it seems to us to be<br />\nas attractive as any college annual<br />\ncould possibly be.

The higher<br />\nclergy were for many years for all<br />\npractical purposes the only educated<br />\nclass in the community. it was<br />\nlargely on that account that the<br />\nposition of the clergy, as a whole<br />\nwas so important. Members of tins<br />\nclass were, because of the intellectual and moral influence of the<br />\nChristian church, the molders of<br />\nsuch public opinion as then existed.<br />\nlhey were, also, practically the only<br />\nliterary men of the day. litom their<br />\nranks, finally, emerged many if not<br />\nmost of the politicians and statesmen who influenced and assisted<br />\nkings and princes and guided the<br />\ndestinies of states.<br />\nThe other occupations, some .of<br />\nwhich have since attained the dignity of learned professions, were in<br />\nformer days days trades rather than<br />\nprofessions. Entrance to them was<br />\nthe result of practical training<br />\nrather than of systematic instruction. Indeed in many lines of work<br />\nthe system of apprenticeship was<br />\ntile only form of education available. Sometimes those engaged in<br />\nthese occupations formed themselves<br />\ninto societies organized after the<br />\nmanner of the merchant and craft<br />\nguilds which had so much influence<br />\non commerce and industry. As a<br />\nresult both of association with their<br />\nfellows and of instruction received<br />\nfrom their superiors the younger<br />\nmembers of these societies acquired<br />\na knowledge, usually empirical in<br />\ncharacter, of the secrets of the<br />\ncraft or mystery of which they intended to devote their lives. Such,<br />\nfor example, in England; were the<br />\nInns of Court organized by the lawyers, and the College of Physicians<br />\nand Surgeons which looked after<br />\nthe interests of those engaged in<br />\nthe practice of medicine.<br />\nDuring the second half of what<br />\nare called the Middle Ages universities were established. In them<br />\nmore or less systematic instruction<br />\nwas given in subjects which had<br />\nnot before the establishment of the<br />\nuniversities been regarded as<br />\nworthy of the attention of the<br />\nlearned, i. e. the \"educated,\" man.<br />\nTo theology and philosophy, which<br />\nhad constituted about all the learning of the day, was added very<br />\ngenerally the study of law and<br />\nmedicine. The study of law first<br />\nappears at Bologna, that of medicine at Salerno, in both cases before the establishment of the universities; but these subjects from a<br />\nvery early time found a place in the<br />\nuniversity. In England, however,<br />\nlaw and medicine did not succeed<br />\nin obtaining an important position<br />\nin the educational system. The<br />\nInns of Court and the College of<br />\nPhysicians and Surgeons gave most<br />\nof the legal and medical instruction<br />\nwhich was given. The universities,<br />\nnevertheless, exerted an influence<br />\non the development of both legal<br />\nand medical study. For instruction<br />\nin. theology and philosophy, which<br />\nmight have a bearing on the solu-<br /><br />\ntion of legal problems, was often<br />\ngiven in the university to individuals who subsequently studied law<br />\nas a trade in the Inns of Court;<br />\nand although the study of medicine<br />\nwas in England carried on for the<br />\nmost part in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, there was still<br />\nin Oxford at any rate from a very<br />\n:.tarly time a professorship of medicine. Students of medicine who<br />\nwere not satisfied with the facilities<br />\noffered in England went, however\u2014<br />\nand in considerable numbers\u2014to the<br />\nContinent for instruction.<br />\nThe function of the early English university was, therefore, in<br />\nlarge measure, to prepare merely<br />\nfor the clerical profession, and it<br />\nmay be said that the English university has not even at the present<br />\ntime entirely emancipated itself<br />\nfrom the clerical and monastic influences to which it was for so long<br />\na time subject.<br />\nThe revival of learning had the<br />\neffect of changing and broadening<br />\nthe work of universities. Systematic instruction was given in a<br />\ngreater number of subjects than before had been the case, particularly<br />\nin the Greek and Latin classics.<br />\nThe aims of those who sought this<br />\ninstruction were, however, almost if<br />\nnot every bit as practical as in the<br />\npast. Most men went to the university in order to fit themselves<br />\nfor their chosen career. There<br />\nwere, however, more learned professions than formerly. One could<br />\nthus be a literary man without being a clergyman. The development<br />\nof the secular statesman, which was<br />\nlargely incidental to the systematic<br />\nstudy of law, also lessened the influence of the clergy in political<br />\naffairs. But for a long time after<br />\nthe first appearance of a secular<br />\nstatesman it was almost necessary<br />\nthat a candidate for political honors<br />\nshould be well versed in what was<br />\nconsidered to be the learning of the<br />\nday. In England, for example, until a comparatively late date a successful and persuasive speech in<br />\nParliament must be replete with<br />\nclassical references and abound in<br />\nquotations from Latin authors who<br />\nwere considered almost to monopolize polite literature.<br />\nThe result was then both in England and on the Continent that,<br />\neven during the period when classical learning cast its most potent<br />\nspell on the European mind, those<br />\nwho studied in the universities were<br />\nactuated by the desire to fit themselves for some specified career.<br />\nThe candidates for the clerical profession, for the legal and medical<br />\nprofessions, and for political honors,<br />\nwent to the university to pursue<br />\nwhat were often regarded as and<br />\nusually were vocational studies.<br />\nThey did not flock to the spring of<br />\nknowledge to quench a thirst for<br />\nlearning. They drank of the waters<br />\nrather to strengthen themselves for<br />\nthe race of life in Nvhich they had<br />\nentered.<br />\nA distinct development of the<br />\nstudy of theology and philosophy in<br />\nthe early days of European education was that phase of European in-<br /><br />\ntellectual life which is known as<br />\nScholasticism. Scholasticism is of<br />\ncourse associated at the present<br />\ntime with almost anything but the<br />\npractical and the useful. The determination of the number of angels that can dance on the point of<br />\na needle, or of the action of the<br />\nhistoric ass placed between two<br />\nbundles of hay, does not seem now<br />\nto be of great practical value; but<br />\nit may not be denied that the answer to these questions was considered in former days to be of fundamental importance. The later study<br />\nof the Greco-Latin classics had<br />\nsomewhat the same influence on<br />\nEuropean intellectual development<br />\nwhich the study of the Chinese<br />\nclassics has apparently had on<br />\nChinese life. It aroused a great admiration for the past and somewhat<br />\nof a contempt for the present. At<br />\nthe same time a knowledge of the<br />\nGreek and Latin classics had, at<br />\none time, great practical value.<br />\nEven now'it has such a value. Almost all modern European languages owe much to Greek and<br />\nLatin, and books of even the present<br />\nday are replete with classical allusions which can with difficulty be<br />\nunderstood by those who have not<br />\nhad a classical training.<br />\nWhat was true of the mediaeval<br />\nschools and of the early universities was nearly as true of the later<br />\nuniversity development. Most students who have entered the portals<br />\nof the university have done so in<br />\norder to carry on vocational studies,<br />\nthat is, in order to make themselves<br />\nmore effective in their subsequent<br />\ncareers. The sphere of activity of<br />\nthe universities has continued, however, to enlarge through bringing<br />\nwithin the reach of their influence<br />\nother occupations which had been<br />\nregarded at one time in the nature<br />\nof trades, but which began to take<br />\non the character of learned professions, and preparations for those<br />\nprofessions has always been one of<br />\nthe most important functions of the<br />\nuniversity. The existing organization of the normal continental university shows clearly its practical<br />\nor vocational character at the present time. That organization is<br />\nbased upon four rather separate and<br />\ndistinct faculties. These are the<br />\nfaculties of theology, philosophy,<br />\nlaw and medicine. Of these all but<br />\nthe faculty of philosophy fit the student for a recognized learned profession. The only one that may not<br />\nbe said to be clearly practical in its<br />\naims is the faculty of philosophy.<br />\nTo this faculty are assigned all the<br />\nsubjects which do not find a place<br />\nin one of the others. But because<br />\nit is not the place of preparation<br />\nfor a recognized learned profession<br />\nwe must not suppose that the aims<br />\nof the faculty of philosophy are<br />\naltogether unpractical. For within<br />\nits jurisdiction are philosophy, history, literature and the 'natural and<br />\npolitical sciences, which usually occupy such an important place in the<br />\nsystem of education adopted in the<br />\nlower schools. It is to the faculty<br />\nof philosophy to which is entrusted<br />\nthe training of teachers in those<br /><br />\n5<br />\nsubjects. Most of the students even<br />\nof the faculty of philosophy are<br />\nthus practical in their aims. For<br />\nthey are endeavoring to fit themselves for their life work of teaching.<br />\nOne of the first if not the first of<br />\nthe new professions which was<br />\nrecognized by the early university<br />\nwas medicine. The advance of<br />\nmedicine to its new dignity was in<br />\nlarge measure due to a change of<br />\nEuropean thought. it may be said<br />\nthat for a considerable period prior<br />\nto the revival of learning European<br />\nthought was in the main like the<br />\nthought of most other parts of the<br />\nworld, theoretical and speculative.<br />\nIt laid great stress on supernatural<br />\ncauses for the ordinary phenomena<br />\nof life and emphasized dialectic and<br />\na priori deductions from assumed<br />\npremises.<br />\nintellectual curiosity<br />\nwith regard to life was satisfied by<br />\nmeditation and speculation rather<br />\nthan by investigation and experimentation. Men , thought rather<br />\nthan observed; reasoned rather than<br />\ngeneralized.<br />\nThis attitude was not always,<br />\nhowever, the attitude of the European mind. Early in the history of<br />\nEuropean thought there had been<br />\nattempts made to observe, to gather<br />\ndata, to generalize inductively from<br />\nthese data and by the process of experimentation to limit the effects of<br />\nthe generalizations made. Aristotle<br />\nand Archimedes, Hippocrates and<br />\nGalen were among the men to<br />\nwhom observation seemed important, who sought by induction to<br />\nreach conclusions and by experiment to test the tentative conclusions reached.<br />\nThis early attempt to elaborate a<br />\nscientific rather than a speculative<br />\nmethod of treating the phenomena<br />\nof life was, however, abandoned.<br />\nThe cause of its abandonment is not<br />\nknown. Changes in general social<br />\nand economic conditions must probably be held in large measure responsible. But it is also just as<br />\ntrue that Europe was being increasingly subjected to Asiatic political<br />\nand intellectual influences. The<br />\nconquests of Alexander the Great,<br />\nalthough usually regarded as the<br />\ntriumph of Europe over Asia, also<br />\nresulted in the subjection of Europe, or at any rate of that part of<br />\nEurope which counted intellectually, to certain Asiatic influences.<br />\nIn the same way the expansion of<br />\nRome somewhat later had perhaps<br />\nas much influence in bringing Asia<br />\nto Europe as in causing the spread<br />\nin Asia of European methods of<br />\nthought. The jus gentium brought<br />\nin by the Roman Prxtor originated<br />\nin large measure in Asia. The<br />\nAsiatic principle of autocratic rule<br />\nreplaced the first feeble attempts at<br />\npopular government made in Greece<br />\nand Rome.<br />\nAt about the same time that these<br />\nlegal and political principles originating in Asia became predominant<br />\nin Europe, other important intellectual and moral ideas also of Asiatic origin made their influence felt<br />\nthere as well. These were the two<br />\ngreat Asiatic religions, that of<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, MAY 21, 1914.<br /><br />\nMythra and Christianity.

The study of literature<br />\nnow consists in large measure of<br />\nthe intensive examination of original texts. History, which formerly was perhaps based more on fiction than on fact, has been rewritten with the desire to attain in some<br />\ndegree the accuracy and precision<br />\ncharacteristic of the pursuit of scientific truth. Economics and political science have become much<br />\nless speculative and theoretical than<br />\nthey once were. While they have<br />\nnot as yet attained unto the dignity<br />\nof exact sciences, probably because<br />\nof the extreme complexity of economic and political problems, as yet<br />\nonly imperfectly understood, they<br />\nare adopting more and more the<br />\nmethods of observation and inductive generalization and are fast losing the deductive character which<br />\nat one time was incident to them and<br />\nto which the general lack of confidence once expressed as to their<br />\nconclusions may in large measure<br />\nhave been due.<br />\nThis vast widening of the field of<br />\neducation and the notable change<br />\nin the point of view to which attention has been called have had<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br /><br />\nPHOTO PLAYS<br />\nNEW THEATRE<br /><br />\nADVANCED VAUDEVILLE<br /><br />\nthe effect of rendering somewhat<br />\nless rather than more practical the<br />\npurposes and aims of those who are<br />\nattending our educational institutions.

A larger<br />\npercentage of students are at the<br />\npresent time than formerly seeking<br />\nan education which is not intended<br />\nto fit them for a well-defined career<br />\nor profession.<br />\nOn the other hand, it cannot be<br />\ndoubted that the character of the<br />\neducation, opportunities for which<br />\nare now open to the student, is<br />\nmore practical than it once was.<br />\nIn the first place, the subjects in<br />\nwhich instruction is given are in<br />\nmany cases much more closely related to the facts of everyday life<br />\nthan were those to which the scholasticism of the Middle Ages devoted so much attention or than<br />\nthose embraced in the almost exclusively philosophical and literary<br />\neducation which was due to the influences of the Renaissance.<br />\nThe Home of Style<br />\nIn the second place, there is a<br />\nalin<br />\ntendency<br />\nevident<br />\nus<br />\ncontinuo<br />\nmost all parts of the European<br />\nworld and particularly in those<br />\nparts of it in which the attainment<br />\nof economy and efficiency is receiving the most attention, towards<br />\ngranting some of the dignity of<br />\nlearned professions to what were<br />\nBaltimore and Hanover Streets<br />\nformerly regarded as mere occupations or trades.<br />\nIs this a tendency to be deprecated?

We must in our<br />\neducational institutions, as has been<br />\nwell said, learn how to live as well<br />\nas how to make a living.<br />\nAt the same time the solution of<br />\nthe problem how to live and how to<br />\nlive rightly and efficiently is not inconsistent with the endeavors on<br />\nthe one hand to enlarge the field of<br />\nhuman knowledge and thus to encroach upon the boundaries of the<br />\nunknown, and on the other hand<br />\nby the application of the scientific<br />\nmethod to even what may be regarded by many as the trivial<br />\nthings of life, to envelop what may<br />\nbe looked upon as mere occupations<br />\nwith the dignity which results from<br />\naccurate knowledge and the sense<br />\nof doing things well.<br />\nMay it not then truthfully be said<br />\nthat educational ideals while perhaps more practical now than formerly are really to be distinguished<br />\nfrom former ideals by reason of the<br />\nfact that they are broader and more<br />\ncomprehensive. We no longer consider education as purely vocational<br />\nor purely cultural. We no longer<br />\nconfine our study to theology and<br />\nphilosophy or to literature and<br />\nmathematics.<br />\nThe functions of modern education indeed are manifold:<br />\nIn the first place it endeavors to<br />\ntransmit to the present generation<br />\na knowledge of our past.

Unless we<br />\ncan discover new principles we may<br />\nreach a time when further progress<br />\nwill cease.<br />\nOur educational system may of<br />\ncourse provide for the study of applied science in institutions not connected with the universities which<br />\nafter the European example may be<br />\nconfined to instruction in the lore<br />\nof the past and to research and investigation. There are, however,<br />\ngreat advantages to be derived from<br />\nthe association of technical schools<br />\nwith universities, particularly where<br />\nresearch and investigation with the<br />\nidea of enlarging the sum of human<br />\nknowledge are recognized as a part<br />\nof the university's work.
