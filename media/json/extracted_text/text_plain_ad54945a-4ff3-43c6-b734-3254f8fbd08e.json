Here, instead of bands<br />\nof disgruntled youths, passing<br />\nthree hours every week to the<br />\ncount of one, two, three, four, we<br />\nfind squads of young, coming athletes engaged in practicing every<br />\nform of athletics. Football, lacrosse, basket-ball and soccer all<br />\nhave their devotees.<br />\nThe \"pep\" and enthusiasm of<br />\nthese junior athletes cannot be emphasized enough. Seldom have<br />\nthere been more closely or more<br />\nhotly contested games than the<br />\ntwo which have already been<br />\nplayed between the two Notball<br />\nsqnads. Iu'these games teamwork<br />\nand headwork was displayed on<br />\nboth sides to such an extent that<br />\nthe victorious team won by the<br />\nslender margin of 'six points in<br />\nboth games. This is only one example of the interest shown by<br />\nthese men. Basket-ball has a great<br />\nnumber of followers, in fact so<br />\nmany that a league of eight teams<br />\nhas been organized. Soccer, although started only Thursday,<br />\npromises, from the number of candidates, to be a great success, and<br />\na huge *squad has already been<br />\npracticing lacrosse for some<br />\nweeks.<br />\nThe greatest drawback to the<br />\nathletic success of Johns Hopkins has been the scarcity of ma-<br />\n<br />\nterial.

By thus<br />\nstimulating an interest in *athletics a far larger number of men<br />\nto pick from can be obtained and<br />\nmany stars who were otherwise<br />\n\"born to blush unseen\" , will be<br />\nbrought to light. Here is where<br />\nthe future quarterback and ends,<br />\nlacrosse and basket-ball players<br />\nwill be procured.

Here, instead of bands<br />\nof disgruntled youths, passing<br />\nthree hours every week to the<br />\ncount of one, two, three, four, we<br />\nfind squads of young, coming athletes engaged in practicing every<br />\nform of athletics.
