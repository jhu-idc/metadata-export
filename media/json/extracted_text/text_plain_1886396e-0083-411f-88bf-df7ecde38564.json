With<br />\nthis year,. however, the question<br />\narose once more: Are those difficulties inherent? Is there not<br />\nsome way in which Hopkins teams<br />\ncan compete under conditions at<br />\nleast approximately equal to those<br />\nQf their rivals'?<br />\nThe cry for undergraduate footha 11 which has been echoing about<br />\nthe University this fall was' not<br />\ndue to the fact that a large number of people believed that graduates had no right to play upon<br />\nHopkins elevens; it was due only<br />\nto. the fact that the present system, under which graduates<br />\nplayed, was believed unsuccessful.<br />\nThat the dissatisfaction with<br />\npresent conditions has been rather<br />\n<br />\ngeneral may be seen by a cursory<br />\nglance through this season's Mail<br />\nBag\u2014and such 'a glance will<br />\nshow, with equal clearness, that<br />\nthe number of remedies offered<br />\nhas been'almost equal to the number of writers.<br />\nThat, frankly, is the present<br />\nstatus; general dissatisfaction<br />\nwith existing conditions, somewhat vague understanding among<br />\nthe majority of undergraduates of<br />\nthe causes which bring those conditions about, and, withal, a<br />\ninvestigation and<br />\npatent need<br />\nsane, logical, considered action\u2014<br />\naction which shall represent a<br />\ndefinite and permanent policy.<br />\nIn voting last Thursday night<br />\nthat President Goodnow be requestea to appoint a committee,<br />\nwith representatives from the undergraduates, the Medical School,<br />\nthe faculty, and the alumni, to<br />\nmake such investigation and to<br />\ntake such action, the OmicrOn<br />\nDelta Kappa took a step which,<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER believes, will<br />\nmeet with the hearty commendation and support of the entire<br />\nUniversity. That President Good110W will grant the petition of the<br />\nsociety, to those 'Who know of the<br />\nkeen and' active interest which he<br />\ntakes in every Hopkins problem,<br />\nis beyond all question,. ,it is<br />\nequally undoubted that' the comni III0V will be composed of men<br />\nW Ito know, the athletic situation<br />\nat. Hopkins with the intimacy,<br />\nthat -.comes of personal association, and who .at the same time<br />\nwill be truly representative of<br />\nevery Hopkins interest.<br />\nThe work of the committee will<br />\nnot be con fined to the question'of<br />\nundergraduate football alone. In<br />\nfact, as TnE NEWS-LETTER sees it,<br />\nthe football' situation, can be<br />\nsolved, not by laying the emphasis<br />\nof the discussion upon the merit<br />\nof eligibility rules, but by laying<br />\nit upon the consideration of just<br />\nhow daylight practice for, the<br />\neleyelf can be assured--whatever<br />\nbe the constituency or the eleven<br />\noloing the practicing. The committee, however, will go far beyond that point-Lit will ,study ;the<br />\nathletic situation at Hopkins in<br />\ngeneral, will consider all possible<br />\npolicies that can b pursued, will<br />\ndecide upon one, .and, with 'all<br />\nlime force of its personnel, will<br />\nwork to See that ,policy made the<br />\npolicy of the University.,<br />\nSuch a course is not only the<br />\nbest possible course\u2014it is the only<br />\npossible course.' Had it not' been<br />\nfor such a committee (for its ap-<br />\n<br />\npointiuent can be taken as a matter of granted), any steps that<br />\nmight have been taken would<br />\nhave been sporadic, temporary,<br />\nand sectional.<br />\nThere is another aspect connected with the idea of this investigation connnittee, however,<br />\nother than that of its momentous<br />\nbearing upon the future of athletics at Hopkins. In standing as<br />\nsponsor for the idea, the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa justifies its existence as a Hopkins institution\u2014<br />\nproves, once for all, that it is not<br />\nmerely an honorary society, designed as the end of a process<br />\nrather than the beginning. That<br />\nsociety is destined to play a large<br />\npart in the development of the<br />\nUniversity for one single reason:<br />\nIt is a focus. It brings representatives of Hopkins activities<br />\ninto a common bond, and, in so<br />\ndoing, it enables them, as a body,<br />\nto take the initiative in action,<br />\nwhich, without that initiative,<br />\nmight never materialize. Some<br />\nsuch step as this was necessary<br />\nto bring the purpose of the Omicron Delta Kappa home to the<br />\nII ndergraduate body; the chief<br />\nvalue of the step, both from the<br />\nstandpoint of the athletic situation which it is intended to<br />\nremedy, and from the standpoint<br />\nof the society itself, is that it is<br />\nmerely the performance of the<br />\nblindingly obvious.<br />\n<br />\nTo Real Hopkins Men.<br />\n<br />\nChristmas time is here, and<br />\nyou're buying presents.<br />\nRemember, that a Sales-Check<br />\nand Pink-Slip Contest is being<br />\nrun by THE NEWS-LETTER, and<br />\nthat many good prize,s will , be<br />\ngiven to the winners. ,<br />\nThe first prize -in the SalesCheck Contest will be a Ilopkins<br />\nroll-collar coat sweater, like the<br />\nones presented to the football<br />\nmen for winning their \"H's.\"<br />\nTickets to the best shows in town,<br />\norders on haberdashery stores,<br />\nand many other desirable things,<br />\nare includ0d in the list of prizes.<br />\nNo blanks.

The story<br />\nOf how that selection was made is<br />\ntold by the late President Gilman,<br />\nIII his \"The Launching of a University.\" Rowland had been teaching in the Rensselaer Polytechnic<br />\nInstitute at Troy, N. Y., and had<br />\nrecently written an article for<br />\nThe Philosophical Magazine<br />\nWhich had attracted wide attention throughout the scientific<br />\nworld. President Gilman had telegraphed Rowland to meet him at<br />\nWest Point. He describes the interview as follows: \"He came at<br />\nonce, and we walked up and down<br />\nliosciusko's garden, talking over<br />\nhis plans and ours. It was obvious<br />\nthat I was in confidential relations with a young man of rare<br />\nintellectual powers and of uncommon aptitude for experimental science. When I reported<br />\nthe facts to the trustees in Baltimore, they said at once, 'Engage<br />\nthat young man and take him<br />\nwith you to Europe, where he may<br />\nfollow the leaders in his science<br />\nand be ready for a professorship.'<br />\nAnd so we did.\"<br />\nAt the end of.the year spent in<br />\nEurope, at Berlin, under the guidance of the great physicist Helmholtz, Rowland came to Baltimore<br />\nto Make preparations for the opening of the University in 1876. Of<br />\nthese preparations, Dr. Ira Remsen, who had been appointed professor of chemistry on the same<br />\nday that Rowland had been appointed professor of physics,<br />\nspeaks in the following terms:<br />\n\"We spent a few days in talking<br />\nover plans with President Gilman.<br />\nIt was arranged that Rowland<br />\nwas to have for his laboratory<br />\nsonic back rooms of the two dwelling-houses which were to serve as<br />\nthe temporary seat of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. He said,'All<br />\nI want is the back kitchen, and a<br />\nsolid pier built up from the<br />\nground.' He got in fact a number<br />\nof small rooms, but they were a<br />\nsorry lot. Such :changes as he<br />\nasked for were made. While in<br />\nEurope, he had ordered apparatus<br />\nfreely\u2014the best that could be had<br />\n\u2014not for lecture experiments, but<br />\nfor scientific work of the greatest<br />\nrefinement and importance. The<br />\nequipment of the `laboratory' was<br />\nall that could be desired.<br />\n\"The little faculty of the University at that time felt that the<br />\nbest thing they could do was to<br />\nlay emphasis on graduate work<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 4)<br />\n<br />\nWAS DESTINED FOR MINISTRY<br />\nAmong the small group who, by their work, succeeded in<br />\nmaking the ideal which underlay the founding of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University a reality, none is more interesting, both<br />\nfor the contributions which he made to his science, and for his<br />\nown personality, than Henry Augustus Rowland. It is almost<br />\nimpossible for the present generation at Hopkins, housed in<br />\nmagnificent buildings, seeing the University grow steadily before their eyes, to realize the boldness of purpose, the steadiness of vision, of those men who, like Rowland, devoted their<br />\nlives to making the few small buildings on Howard street the<br />\nhome of a university which set a new mark among American<br />\ninstitutions. Today, no list of the leaders of science stands<br />\ncomplete without Rowland's name; the knowledge of how that<br />\nname rose into eminence, of the character of the man who<br />\nbore it, should be a thing intimate to every Hopkins man.<br />\nWithin the limit of these two pages, The News-Letter is<br />\npublishing articles upon the life and work of Rowland, together<br />\nwith a quotation from one of his addresses, which mirrors the<br />\nbreadth, the intellectual force of the man,far better than could<br />\nany words of ours. These pages are not intended to render<br />\nhomage to a great scholar\u2014that homage has been paid too<br />\nillustriously by his fellow-scholars throughout the world; they<br />\nare intended only as a partial aid in bringing the Hopkins of<br />\nthe present to a deeper understanding, a deeper reverence,for<br />\nthe Hopkins of the past.<br />\n<br />\nHENRY AUGUSTUS ROWLAND<br />\n<br />\nPursued Classical Studies Before Tui ning<br />\nto His Natural Field\u2014Always an<br />\nArdent Lover of Out-ofDoor Sports.<br />\n<br />\nHenry Augustus Rowland, professor of physics at Hopkins from<br />\n1876 to 1901, and one of the<br />\nworld's most eminent physicists,<br />\nwas born at Honesdale, Pa., in<br />\n1848. His father, his grandfather,<br />\nand his great-grandfather were all<br />\nThey were college<br />\nministers.<br />\ngraduates and well-educated men.<br />\nWhen Rowland was quite young,<br />\nthe family moved to Newark, N.<br />\nJ., where his education was begun. He attended Newark Academy, and although giving evidence<br />\nof brilliance in some studies, his<br />\ntastes did not follow in the line of<br />\nhis ancestors. He was deficient in<br />\nLatin, but showed great interest<br />\nin mathematics and science. Mr.<br />\nb. A. Earrand, of Newark Acauemy, uuuer wuose teacutug lie<br />\ncame, writes:<br />\n-I advised his mother to let<br />\nHenry drop the distasteiul study<br />\nand to direct his education along<br />\nthose lines so distinctly marked<br />\nin his nature. But classical trauitions were strong in tue tawny,<br />\nills iatner, granutatuer, and great.granatatner having been grauu. ates of Yale, and clergymen. His<br />\nmother had no other tuouglit than<br />\nthat Henry would follow in tile<br />\nsuccession and keep up the traditions of the family. He did continue his classical studies for a<br />\nyear or two more, during which<br />\ntime Mrs. Rowland and I had several conferences concerniqg the<br />\nmatter. Henry's dislike increased<br />\nand was intensified by the addition of Greek to his studies. I<br />\nhad a deep sympathy with him,<br />\nfor he was struggling manfully to<br />\ndo that which to him was impossible. Finally, I said to his<br />\nmother that my convictions were<br />\nso strong that his educational development should proceed in different lines, that if he must continue his classical studies I preferred that he should do so in<br />\nsome other school.<br />\n\"Mrs. Rowland decided to make<br />\none more effort, failing in which<br />\nshe would follow my advice.<br />\nHenry was accordingly sent to<br />\nPhillips Academy, Andover, Mass.,<br />\nwhere, after, a brief period of<br />\ntorture with Latin and Greek, he<br />\nwas permitted to drop them,<br />\ngreatly to his delight and my own.\"<br />\nHe next entered the Rensselaer<br />\nPolytechnic Institute at Troy, N.<br />\nY., where he could continue his<br />\nchosen subjects away from all<br />\nthoughts of ancient languages.<br />\nHe stayed at Troy three years,<br />\nduring which time he showed himself to be an earnest and able student in the sciences.<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, DECEMBER 18, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nRowland on the Educatcd Man.<br />\n[F'ro.n his address, \"The Phrical<br />\nLab ,ratory in Modern Edueati, n,\"<br />\ndelivered at the tenth commen.oradon exercises of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, April 26, 1886.]<br />\n<br />\nFrom the moment we are born<br />\ninto this world down to the day<br />\nwhen we leave it, we are called<br />\nupon every moment to exercise<br />\nour judgment with respect to matters pertaining to our welfare.<br />\nWhile nature has supplied us<br />\nwith instincts which take the<br />\nplace of reason in our infancy,<br />\nand which form the basis of<br />\naction in very many person:,<br />\nthrough life, yet, more and more<br />\nas the world progresses and as we<br />\ndepart from the age of childhood,<br />\nwe are force.1 to discriminate be<br />\ntween right and wrong, between<br />\ntruth and falsehood. No longer<br />\ncan we shelter ourselves behind<br />\nthose in authority over us, but we<br />\nmust come to the front and each<br />\none decide for himself what to believe and how to act in the daily<br />\nroutine and the emergencies of<br />\nlife. This is not given to us as<br />\na duty which we can neglect, if<br />\nwe please, but it is that which<br />\nevery man or woman consciously<br />\nor unconsciously, must go through<br />\nwith.<br />\nMost persons cut this gordian<br />\nknot, which they cannot untangle,<br />\nby accepting the opinions which<br />\nhave been taught them and which<br />\nappear correct to their particular<br />\ncircle of friends and associates;<br />\nothers take the opposite extreme,<br />\nand, with intellectual arrogance,<br />\nseek to build up their opinions<br />\nand beliefs from the very foundation, individually and alone, with-<br />\n<br />\nout help from others. Intermediate between these two extremes<br />\nconies the man with full respect<br />\nfor the opinions of those around<br />\nhim, and yet with such discrimination_ that he sees a chance of error<br />\nin all and most of all in himself.<br />\nHe has a longing for the truth,<br />\nand is willing to test himself, to<br />\ntest others and to test nature<br />\nuntil he finds it. He has the courage of his opinions when taus<br />\ncarefully formed and is then, but<br />\nnot tin then, willing to stand betore tile woriu and proclaim what<br />\nue considers the truth. Like<br />\nualileo and 'Copernicus he inaugurates a new era in science, or<br />\nlike Luther, in the religious benet of mankind. He neither<br />\nshrinks within himself at tue<br />\nthought of having an opinion of<br />\nIns own, or yet believes it is. to<br />\nbe the only one worth considering<br />\nin the world; he is neither crushed<br />\nwith intellectual humility, nor yet<br />\nexalted with intellectual pride;<br />\nhe sees that the problems of nature and society can be solved,<br />\nand yet he knows that this can<br />\nonly come about by the combined<br />\nintellect of the world acting<br />\nthrough ages of time and that<br />\nhe, though his intellect were that<br />\nof Newton, can, at best, do very<br />\nlittle toward it. Knowing this he<br />\nseeks all the aids in his power to<br />\nascertain the truth and if he,<br />\nthrough either ambition or love of<br />\ntruth, wishes to impress his opinions on the world, he first takes<br />\ncare to have them correct. Above<br />\nall he is willing to abstain from<br />\nhaving opinions on subjects of<br />\nwhich he knows nothing.<br />\nIt is the province of education<br />\nto form such a mind while at the<br />\nsame time giving to it enough<br />\nknowledge to have a broad ,outlook over the world of science, art<br />\nand letters.<br />\n<br />\nWAS DESTINED FOR MINISTRY<br />\n<br />\nMADE EXPERIMENTS IN GROCERY<br />\n<br />\n(Continuedfrom page 5)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued Irom page 5)<br />\n<br />\nAfter Troy he entered the Sheffield scientific School, where he<br />\nstudied chemistry for a year.

He was very fond of trout<br />\nfishing. Many of his summers<br />\nwere spent in the open, along the<br />\nstreams where trout were to be<br />\nfound.<br />\nIn 1890 he married Miss Henrietta Harrison, of Baltimore. He<br />\nhad three children\u2014two boys,<br />\nboth now attending Johns Hopkins, and a girl. Professor Rowland received practically every<br />\nhonor that a scientist could obtain, being elected to membership<br />\ninto all the prominent scientific<br />\nsocieties of this country and Europe. He won the Grand Prix<br />\nprize at a Paris exhibition, the<br />\nRumford Medal, the Matteucci<br />\nMedal, besides receiving degrees<br />\nfrom several universities and being made an officer of the Legion<br />\nof Honor.<br />\n<br />\nand especially on research.

Professor Remsen, in his article on Rowland, describes the conditions under which this experiment was<br />\nconducted:<br />\n\"The original back kitchen was<br />\nnot adequate,\" he says. \"It happened tnat the University had<br />\ncome into possession of a small<br />\nold building on a near street.<br />\nThis had been used as a grocery<br />\nstore. In the rear was a most<br />\ndisreputable-looking room\u2014dirty<br />\nsmall, dilapidated. Here the delicate apparatus was set up and<br />\nhere the experiments were carried<br />\non day by day, and it is certain<br />\nthat the work could not have been<br />\ndone better if it had been done in<br />\na palatial laboratory.\"<br />\nRowland's contributions to . experimental physics are divided by<br />\nt'rof. Joseph S. Ames into three<br />\ngroups: First, those involving,<br />\ndistinctly original concepts; second, those whose purpose it was<br />\nto measure with accuracy certain<br />\nphysical constants; third, those in<br />\nwhich his engineering talents were<br />\nmost conspicuous. Professor Ames<br />\ndescribes some of these contributions in the following language:<br />\n\"During his years at Troy he<br />\n(Rowland) was a faithful reader<br />\nof Faraday's great researches and<br />\nwas specially struck with his concept of magnetic lines of force.<br />\nRowland formed a clear, physical<br />\npicture of this, put it into mathematical language, deduced the<br />\nconsequences of his own theory<br />\nand tested them by actual experiment. (In doing this, part of his<br />\napparatus was on his washstand,<br />\nanother part on his window sill<br />\nand still another had to repose<br />\nupon his bed, because the Polytechnic Institute did not offer him<br />\nany facilities.)

With<br />\nthis year,. however, the question<br />\narose once more: Are those difficulties inherent? Is there not<br />\nsome way in which Hopkins teams<br />\ncan compete under conditions at<br />\nleast approximately equal to those<br />\nQf their rivals'?<br />\nThe cry for undergraduate footha 11 which has been echoing about<br />\nthe University this fall was' not<br />\ndue to the fact that a large number of people believed that graduates had no right to play upon<br />\nHopkins elevens; it was due only<br />\nto. the fact that the present system, under which graduates<br />\nplayed, was believed unsuccessful.<br />\nThat the dissatisfaction with<br />\npresent conditions has been rather<br /><br />\ngeneral may be seen by a cursory<br />\nglance through this season's Mail<br />\nBag\u2014and such 'a glance will<br />\nshow, with equal clearness, that<br />\nthe number of remedies offered<br />\nhas been'almost equal to the number of writers.<br />\nThat, frankly, is the present<br />\nstatus; general dissatisfaction<br />\nwith existing conditions, somewhat vague understanding among<br />\nthe majority of undergraduates of<br />\nthe causes which bring those conditions about, and, withal, a<br />\ninvestigation and<br />\npatent need<br />\nsane, logical, considered action\u2014<br />\naction which shall represent a<br />\ndefinite and permanent policy.<br />\nIn voting last Thursday night<br />\nthat President Goodnow be requestea to appoint a committee,<br />\nwith representatives from the undergraduates, the Medical School,<br />\nthe faculty, and the alumni, to<br />\nmake such investigation and to<br />\ntake such action, the OmicrOn<br />\nDelta Kappa took a step which,<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER believes, will<br />\nmeet with the hearty commendation and support of the entire<br />\nUniversity. That President Good110W will grant the petition of the<br />\nsociety, to those 'Who know of the<br />\nkeen and' active interest which he<br />\ntakes in every Hopkins problem,<br />\nis beyond all question,. ,it is<br />\nequally undoubted that' the comni III0V will be composed of men<br />\nW Ito know, the athletic situation<br />\nat. Hopkins with the intimacy,<br />\nthat -.comes of personal association, and who .at the same time<br />\nwill be truly representative of<br />\nevery Hopkins interest.<br />\nThe work of the committee will<br />\nnot be con fined to the question'of<br />\nundergraduate football alone. In<br />\nfact, as TnE NEWS-LETTER sees it,<br />\nthe football' situation, can be<br />\nsolved, not by laying the emphasis<br />\nof the discussion upon the merit<br />\nof eligibility rules, but by laying<br />\nit upon the consideration of just<br />\nhow daylight practice for, the<br />\neleyelf can be assured--whatever<br />\nbe the constituency or the eleven<br />\noloing the practicing. The committee, however, will go far beyond that point-Lit will ,study ;the<br />\nathletic situation at Hopkins in<br />\ngeneral, will consider all possible<br />\npolicies that can b pursued, will<br />\ndecide upon one, .and, with 'all<br />\nlime force of its personnel, will<br />\nwork to See that ,policy made the<br />\npolicy of the University.,<br />\nSuch a course is not only the<br />\nbest possible course\u2014it is the only<br />\npossible course.' Had it not' been<br />\nfor such a committee (for its ap-<br /><br />\npointiuent can be taken as a matter of granted), any steps that<br />\nmight have been taken would<br />\nhave been sporadic, temporary,<br />\nand sectional.<br />\nThere is another aspect connected with the idea of this investigation connnittee, however,<br />\nother than that of its momentous<br />\nbearing upon the future of athletics at Hopkins. In standing as<br />\nsponsor for the idea, the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa justifies its existence as a Hopkins institution\u2014<br />\nproves, once for all, that it is not<br />\nmerely an honorary society, designed as the end of a process<br />\nrather than the beginning. That<br />\nsociety is destined to play a large<br />\npart in the development of the<br />\nUniversity for one single reason:<br />\nIt is a focus. It brings representatives of Hopkins activities<br />\ninto a common bond, and, in so<br />\ndoing, it enables them, as a body,<br />\nto take the initiative in action,<br />\nwhich, without that initiative,<br />\nmight never materialize. Some<br />\nsuch step as this was necessary<br />\nto bring the purpose of the Omicron Delta Kappa home to the<br />\nII ndergraduate body; the chief<br />\nvalue of the step, both from the<br />\nstandpoint of the athletic situation which it is intended to<br />\nremedy, and from the standpoint<br />\nof the society itself, is that it is<br />\nmerely the performance of the<br />\nblindingly obvious.<br /><br />\nTo Real Hopkins Men.<br /><br />\nChristmas time is here, and<br />\nyou're buying presents.<br />\nRemember, that a Sales-Check<br />\nand Pink-Slip Contest is being<br />\nrun by THE NEWS-LETTER, and<br />\nthat many good prize,s will , be<br />\ngiven to the winners. ,<br />\nThe first prize -in the SalesCheck Contest will be a Ilopkins<br />\nroll-collar coat sweater, like the<br />\nones presented to the football<br />\nmen for winning their \"H's.\"<br />\nTickets to the best shows in town,<br />\norders on haberdashery stores,<br />\nand many other desirable things,<br />\nare includ0d in the list of prizes.<br />\nNo blanks.

The story<br />\nOf how that selection was made is<br />\ntold by the late President Gilman,<br />\nIII his \"The Launching of a University.\" Rowland had been teaching in the Rensselaer Polytechnic<br />\nInstitute at Troy, N. Y., and had<br />\nrecently written an article for<br />\nThe Philosophical Magazine<br />\nWhich had attracted wide attention throughout the scientific<br />\nworld. President Gilman had telegraphed Rowland to meet him at<br />\nWest Point. He describes the interview as follows: \"He came at<br />\nonce, and we walked up and down<br />\nliosciusko's garden, talking over<br />\nhis plans and ours. It was obvious<br />\nthat I was in confidential relations with a young man of rare<br />\nintellectual powers and of uncommon aptitude for experimental science. When I reported<br />\nthe facts to the trustees in Baltimore, they said at once, 'Engage<br />\nthat young man and take him<br />\nwith you to Europe, where he may<br />\nfollow the leaders in his science<br />\nand be ready for a professorship.'<br />\nAnd so we did.\"<br />\nAt the end of.the year spent in<br />\nEurope, at Berlin, under the guidance of the great physicist Helmholtz, Rowland came to Baltimore<br />\nto Make preparations for the opening of the University in 1876. Of<br />\nthese preparations, Dr. Ira Remsen, who had been appointed professor of chemistry on the same<br />\nday that Rowland had been appointed professor of physics,<br />\nspeaks in the following terms:<br />\n\"We spent a few days in talking<br />\nover plans with President Gilman.<br />\nIt was arranged that Rowland<br />\nwas to have for his laboratory<br />\nsonic back rooms of the two dwelling-houses which were to serve as<br />\nthe temporary seat of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. He said,'All<br />\nI want is the back kitchen, and a<br />\nsolid pier built up from the<br />\nground.' He got in fact a number<br />\nof small rooms, but they were a<br />\nsorry lot. Such :changes as he<br />\nasked for were made. While in<br />\nEurope, he had ordered apparatus<br />\nfreely\u2014the best that could be had<br />\n\u2014not for lecture experiments, but<br />\nfor scientific work of the greatest<br />\nrefinement and importance. The<br />\nequipment of the `laboratory' was<br />\nall that could be desired.<br />\n\"The little faculty of the University at that time felt that the<br />\nbest thing they could do was to<br />\nlay emphasis on graduate work<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 4)<br /><br />\nWAS DESTINED FOR MINISTRY<br />\nAmong the small group who, by their work, succeeded in<br />\nmaking the ideal which underlay the founding of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University a reality, none is more interesting, both<br />\nfor the contributions which he made to his science, and for his<br />\nown personality, than Henry Augustus Rowland. It is almost<br />\nimpossible for the present generation at Hopkins, housed in<br />\nmagnificent buildings, seeing the University grow steadily before their eyes, to realize the boldness of purpose, the steadiness of vision, of those men who, like Rowland, devoted their<br />\nlives to making the few small buildings on Howard street the<br />\nhome of a university which set a new mark among American<br />\ninstitutions. Today, no list of the leaders of science stands<br />\ncomplete without Rowland's name; the knowledge of how that<br />\nname rose into eminence, of the character of the man who<br />\nbore it, should be a thing intimate to every Hopkins man.<br />\nWithin the limit of these two pages, The News-Letter is<br />\npublishing articles upon the life and work of Rowland, together<br />\nwith a quotation from one of his addresses, which mirrors the<br />\nbreadth, the intellectual force of the man,far better than could<br />\nany words of ours. These pages are not intended to render<br />\nhomage to a great scholar\u2014that homage has been paid too<br />\nillustriously by his fellow-scholars throughout the world; they<br />\nare intended only as a partial aid in bringing the Hopkins of<br />\nthe present to a deeper understanding, a deeper reverence,for<br />\nthe Hopkins of the past.<br /><br />\nHENRY AUGUSTUS ROWLAND<br /><br />\nPursued Classical Studies Before Tui ning<br />\nto His Natural Field\u2014Always an<br />\nArdent Lover of Out-ofDoor Sports.<br /><br />\nHenry Augustus Rowland, professor of physics at Hopkins from<br />\n1876 to 1901, and one of the<br />\nworld's most eminent physicists,<br />\nwas born at Honesdale, Pa., in<br />\n1848. His father, his grandfather,<br />\nand his great-grandfather were all<br />\nThey were college<br />\nministers.<br />\ngraduates and well-educated men.<br />\nWhen Rowland was quite young,<br />\nthe family moved to Newark, N.<br />\nJ., where his education was begun. He attended Newark Academy, and although giving evidence<br />\nof brilliance in some studies, his<br />\ntastes did not follow in the line of<br />\nhis ancestors. He was deficient in<br />\nLatin, but showed great interest<br />\nin mathematics and science. Mr.<br />\nb. A. Earrand, of Newark Acauemy, uuuer wuose teacutug lie<br />\ncame, writes:<br />\n-I advised his mother to let<br />\nHenry drop the distasteiul study<br />\nand to direct his education along<br />\nthose lines so distinctly marked<br />\nin his nature. But classical trauitions were strong in tue tawny,<br />\nills iatner, granutatuer, and great.granatatner having been grauu. ates of Yale, and clergymen. His<br />\nmother had no other tuouglit than<br />\nthat Henry would follow in tile<br />\nsuccession and keep up the traditions of the family. He did continue his classical studies for a<br />\nyear or two more, during which<br />\ntime Mrs. Rowland and I had several conferences concerniqg the<br />\nmatter. Henry's dislike increased<br />\nand was intensified by the addition of Greek to his studies. I<br />\nhad a deep sympathy with him,<br />\nfor he was struggling manfully to<br />\ndo that which to him was impossible. Finally, I said to his<br />\nmother that my convictions were<br />\nso strong that his educational development should proceed in different lines, that if he must continue his classical studies I preferred that he should do so in<br />\nsome other school.<br />\n\"Mrs. Rowland decided to make<br />\none more effort, failing in which<br />\nshe would follow my advice.<br />\nHenry was accordingly sent to<br />\nPhillips Academy, Andover, Mass.,<br />\nwhere, after, a brief period of<br />\ntorture with Latin and Greek, he<br />\nwas permitted to drop them,<br />\ngreatly to his delight and my own.\"<br />\nHe next entered the Rensselaer<br />\nPolytechnic Institute at Troy, N.<br />\nY., where he could continue his<br />\nchosen subjects away from all<br />\nthoughts of ancient languages.<br />\nHe stayed at Troy three years,<br />\nduring which time he showed himself to be an earnest and able student in the sciences.<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3)<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, DECEMBER 18, 1916.<br /><br />\nRowland on the Educatcd Man.<br />\n[F'ro.n his address, \"The Phrical<br />\nLab ,ratory in Modern Edueati, n,\"<br />\ndelivered at the tenth commen.oradon exercises of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, April 26, 1886.]<br /><br />\nFrom the moment we are born<br />\ninto this world down to the day<br />\nwhen we leave it, we are called<br />\nupon every moment to exercise<br />\nour judgment with respect to matters pertaining to our welfare.<br />\nWhile nature has supplied us<br />\nwith instincts which take the<br />\nplace of reason in our infancy,<br />\nand which form the basis of<br />\naction in very many person:,<br />\nthrough life, yet, more and more<br />\nas the world progresses and as we<br />\ndepart from the age of childhood,<br />\nwe are force.1 to discriminate be<br />\ntween right and wrong, between<br />\ntruth and falsehood. No longer<br />\ncan we shelter ourselves behind<br />\nthose in authority over us, but we<br />\nmust come to the front and each<br />\none decide for himself what to believe and how to act in the daily<br />\nroutine and the emergencies of<br />\nlife. This is not given to us as<br />\na duty which we can neglect, if<br />\nwe please, but it is that which<br />\nevery man or woman consciously<br />\nor unconsciously, must go through<br />\nwith.<br />\nMost persons cut this gordian<br />\nknot, which they cannot untangle,<br />\nby accepting the opinions which<br />\nhave been taught them and which<br />\nappear correct to their particular<br />\ncircle of friends and associates;<br />\nothers take the opposite extreme,<br />\nand, with intellectual arrogance,<br />\nseek to build up their opinions<br />\nand beliefs from the very foundation, individually and alone, with-<br /><br />\nout help from others. Intermediate between these two extremes<br />\nconies the man with full respect<br />\nfor the opinions of those around<br />\nhim, and yet with such discrimination_ that he sees a chance of error<br />\nin all and most of all in himself.<br />\nHe has a longing for the truth,<br />\nand is willing to test himself, to<br />\ntest others and to test nature<br />\nuntil he finds it. He has the courage of his opinions when taus<br />\ncarefully formed and is then, but<br />\nnot tin then, willing to stand betore tile woriu and proclaim what<br />\nue considers the truth. Like<br />\nualileo and 'Copernicus he inaugurates a new era in science, or<br />\nlike Luther, in the religious benet of mankind. He neither<br />\nshrinks within himself at tue<br />\nthought of having an opinion of<br />\nIns own, or yet believes it is. to<br />\nbe the only one worth considering<br />\nin the world; he is neither crushed<br />\nwith intellectual humility, nor yet<br />\nexalted with intellectual pride;<br />\nhe sees that the problems of nature and society can be solved,<br />\nand yet he knows that this can<br />\nonly come about by the combined<br />\nintellect of the world acting<br />\nthrough ages of time and that<br />\nhe, though his intellect were that<br />\nof Newton, can, at best, do very<br />\nlittle toward it. Knowing this he<br />\nseeks all the aids in his power to<br />\nascertain the truth and if he,<br />\nthrough either ambition or love of<br />\ntruth, wishes to impress his opinions on the world, he first takes<br />\ncare to have them correct. Above<br />\nall he is willing to abstain from<br />\nhaving opinions on subjects of<br />\nwhich he knows nothing.<br />\nIt is the province of education<br />\nto form such a mind while at the<br />\nsame time giving to it enough<br />\nknowledge to have a broad ,outlook over the world of science, art<br />\nand letters.<br /><br />\nWAS DESTINED FOR MINISTRY<br /><br />\nMADE EXPERIMENTS IN GROCERY<br /><br />\n(Continuedfrom page 5)<br /><br />\n(Continued Irom page 5)<br /><br />\nAfter Troy he entered the Sheffield scientific School, where he<br />\nstudied chemistry for a year. On<br />\ncompleting this session at New<br />\nHaven he returned to Rensselaer<br />\nand there received his civil engineer's degree in 1870.<br />\nDuring the winter of 1871-72<br />\nRowland taught at Wooster, Ohio,<br />\nafter which ue again returned to<br />\nTroy, this time as an instructor<br />\nin physics.

He was very fond of trout<br />\nfishing. Many of his summers<br />\nwere spent in the open, along the<br />\nstreams where trout were to be<br />\nfound.<br />\nIn 1890 he married Miss Henrietta Harrison, of Baltimore. He<br />\nhad three children\u2014two boys,<br />\nboth now attending Johns Hopkins, and a girl. Professor Rowland received practically every<br />\nhonor that a scientist could obtain, being elected to membership<br />\ninto all the prominent scientific<br />\nsocieties of this country and Europe. He won the Grand Prix<br />\nprize at a Paris exhibition, the<br />\nRumford Medal, the Matteucci<br />\nMedal, besides receiving degrees<br />\nfrom several universities and being made an officer of the Legion<br />\nof Honor.<br /><br />\nand especially on research. Rowland had this in mind in ordering<br />\napparatus in Euiope, and in a<br />\nshort time he had probably the<br />\nbest collection of apparatus for<br />\nresearcn in America. * * * To<br />\n.<br />\nsome of us, probably to all tue<br />\nyounger members, tile president<br />\nsaiu repeateuly, 'Do your best<br />\nwork, wuatever it may be,' anu no<br />\nbody of workers could have been<br />\nmore tree to work out tueir o wu<br />\nsan ation.

He<br />\nnau to uo things in nis own flay.<br />\nHe was an investigator, and to<br />\ncue work of investigation he<br />\nturned at once.\"<br />\nOne of the most important of<br />\nRowland's worKs was tue devising<br />\nof a method for tue redetermination of the mechanical equivalent<br />\nof heat, for which he obtained a<br />\nfigure that, differing somewhat<br />\nfrom those obtained by his predecessors, to this day, has stood<br />\nthe test of all criticism. Professor Remsen, in his article on Rowland, describes the conditions under which this experiment was<br />\nconducted:<br />\n\"The original back kitchen was<br />\nnot adequate,\" he says. \"It happened tnat the University had<br />\ncome into possession of a small<br />\nold building on a near street.<br />\nThis had been used as a grocery<br />\nstore. In the rear was a most<br />\ndisreputable-looking room\u2014dirty<br />\nsmall, dilapidated. Here the delicate apparatus was set up and<br />\nhere the experiments were carried<br />\non day by day, and it is certain<br />\nthat the work could not have been<br />\ndone better if it had been done in<br />\na palatial laboratory.\"<br />\nRowland's contributions to . experimental physics are divided by<br />\nt'rof. Joseph S. Ames into three<br />\ngroups: First, those involving,<br />\ndistinctly original concepts; second, those whose purpose it was<br />\nto measure with accuracy certain<br />\nphysical constants; third, those in<br />\nwhich his engineering talents were<br />\nmost conspicuous.
