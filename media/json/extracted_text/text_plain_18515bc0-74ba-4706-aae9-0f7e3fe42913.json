All during the second half, it<br />\nwas very evident that the Maryland<br />\nfive had lost the wonderful co-ordination and smooth playing that<br />\nthey had shown in the first stages of<br />\nplay, and that the Jay five had<br />\nacquired, to some extent, the firey<br />\nplaying of the Terps and an ability<br />\nto score goals, which had been lacking among the Hopkins quintet previously. The Jay defense, in the<br />\nsecond period, held the Maryland<br />\nfive to a score just half as large as<br />\nthe had rolled up in the first half,<br />\nwhile they themselves put on steam<br />\nand more than doubled their first<br />\nperiod score.

Matters concerning the fundamental policies of Johns<br />\nHopkins were discussed by Dr. Ames and Mr. MacMurray at the Commemoration Day Exercises, two Hopkins men, Dr. Goodnow and<br />\nSidney Lanier, were singularly honored, and the new library decorations were formally completed.<br />\nDr. Ames again stressed the spirit of freedom at Johns Hopkins in<br />\nhis speech at the Lyric Saturday. It has always been the policy of the<br />\nadministrative officials to allow the members of the faculty to give<br />\ntheir courses in their own manner. Contrast this policy with that of<br />\nother universities, which do their best to attract brilliant professors<br />\nonly to destroy this value by forcing them to conform strictly to<br />\npedagogical principles. Hopkins allows its professors to retain their<br />\nindividuality, to make decisions on matters which they alone are<br />\nqualified to judge, and endeavours to keep the members of the faculty<br />\nfrom becoming mere audible text-books. The restrictive principles<br />\nemployed by most colleges tends to the treatment of ideas as though<br />\nthey were parts of a Ford car; all thoughts are carefully examined<br />\nby the college officials and, if they conform to pre-conceived judgments, they are stamped \"Approved\" and allowed to be given to a<br />\nbored world. But if, Heaven forbid, some spark of originality should<br />\nenter into the minds of a member of the faculty it is promptly and<br />\nforcibly extinguished. We should rejoice that Hopkins allows men to<br />\nthink for themselves and to impart their ideas to others without undergoing the fear of starving their wives and families by so doing.<br />\nJohn Van Antwerp MacMurray, the chairman of the Page School,<br />\noutlined the method of study which the school will pursue. Following<br />\nthe Hopkins tradition, the research plan will be employed. Mr. MacMurray stressed the point that the study of national psychologies will<br />\nplay a prominent part in the work of the school. The amalgamation<br />\nof two social sciences, political science and psychology, studied along<br />\nthe lines usually reserved for the more exact sciences should prove an<br />\n\u2022 interesting experiment. The Page School undoubtedly will throw light<br />\nupon many of the problems of international relations; its practical<br />\nvalue will depend on to what extent the men who conduct diplomatic<br />\nand commercial intercourse between nations will allow themselves to<br />\nbe influenced by the conclusions reached by the School.<br />\nThe awarding of the degree of Doctor of Laws to President-Emeritus<br />\nGoodnow came as a fitting climax to his career at Johns Hopkins. No<br />\nman living has done more for the University; no man has carried out<br />\nfiner projects at Hopkins; no man could more fittingly be honored by<br />\nHopkins than Dr. Goodnow.<br />\n<br />\n\"Merion will challenge other<br />\ndormitory teams as soon as the athletic committee decides the status of<br />\nof the team's members, the captain<br />\nannounced yesterday.<br />\n\"The line-up:<br />\n<br />\nHii<br />\n<br />\nIIIIjI<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\nMerion\u2014Dempsey (c) left tiddle; Saint, center tiddle; Abbl, right<br />\ntiddle.<br />\nFounders\u2014Logan, left tiddle; De<br />\nMott, center tiddle; Chadwick (c)<br />\nright tiddle.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nRev.

So<br />\nnow, he has declared that he is determined to prosecute future offenders. \"To jail with collegiate sign<br />\nstealers!\" is the battle cry to be<br />\nheard in the highways and byways<br />\nof the little town of Bethlehem. The<br />\nmatter has been referred to the Interfraternity Council and immediate action is demanded. Warrants<br />\nfor individual students will be<br />\nsworn in if necessary, and several<br />\nof the more active frats fear a<br />\nveritable reign of terror if the Police Superintendent makes good his<br />\nthreat of issuing search warrants<br />\nfor every Lehigh frat house.

All during the second half, it<br />\nwas very evident that the Maryland<br />\nfive had lost the wonderful co-ordination and smooth playing that<br />\nthey had shown in the first stages of<br />\nplay, and that the Jay five had<br />\nacquired, to some extent, the firey<br />\nplaying of the Terps and an ability<br />\nto score goals, which had been lacking among the Hopkins quintet previously. The Jay defense, in the<br />\nsecond period, held the Maryland<br />\nfive to a score just half as large as<br />\nthe had rolled up in the first half,<br />\nwhile they themselves put on steam<br />\nand more than doubled their first<br />\nperiod score.

Matters concerning the fundamental policies of Johns<br />\nHopkins were discussed by Dr. Ames and Mr. MacMurray at the Commemoration Day Exercises, two Hopkins men, Dr. Goodnow and<br />\nSidney Lanier, were singularly honored, and the new library decorations were formally completed.<br />\nDr. Ames again stressed the spirit of freedom at Johns Hopkins in<br />\nhis speech at the Lyric Saturday. It has always been the policy of the<br />\nadministrative officials to allow the members of the faculty to give<br />\ntheir courses in their own manner. Contrast this policy with that of<br />\nother universities, which do their best to attract brilliant professors<br />\nonly to destroy this value by forcing them to conform strictly to<br />\npedagogical principles. Hopkins allows its professors to retain their<br />\nindividuality, to make decisions on matters which they alone are<br />\nqualified to judge, and endeavours to keep the members of the faculty<br />\nfrom becoming mere audible text-books. The restrictive principles<br />\nemployed by most colleges tends to the treatment of ideas as though<br />\nthey were parts of a Ford car; all thoughts are carefully examined<br />\nby the college officials and, if they conform to pre-conceived judgments, they are stamped \"Approved\" and allowed to be given to a<br />\nbored world. But if, Heaven forbid, some spark of originality should<br />\nenter into the minds of a member of the faculty it is promptly and<br />\nforcibly extinguished. We should rejoice that Hopkins allows men to<br />\nthink for themselves and to impart their ideas to others without undergoing the fear of starving their wives and families by so doing.<br />\nJohn Van Antwerp MacMurray, the chairman of the Page School,<br />\noutlined the method of study which the school will pursue. Following<br />\nthe Hopkins tradition, the research plan will be employed. Mr. MacMurray stressed the point that the study of national psychologies will<br />\nplay a prominent part in the work of the school. The amalgamation<br />\nof two social sciences, political science and psychology, studied along<br />\nthe lines usually reserved for the more exact sciences should prove an<br />\n\u2022 interesting experiment. The Page School undoubtedly will throw light<br />\nupon many of the problems of international relations; its practical<br />\nvalue will depend on to what extent the men who conduct diplomatic<br />\nand commercial intercourse between nations will allow themselves to<br />\nbe influenced by the conclusions reached by the School.<br />\nThe awarding of the degree of Doctor of Laws to President-Emeritus<br />\nGoodnow came as a fitting climax to his career at Johns Hopkins. No<br />\nman living has done more for the University; no man has carried out<br />\nfiner projects at Hopkins; no man could more fittingly be honored by<br />\nHopkins than Dr. Goodnow.<br /><br />\n\"Merion will challenge other<br />\ndormitory teams as soon as the athletic committee decides the status of<br />\nof the team's members, the captain<br />\nannounced yesterday.<br />\n\"The line-up:<br /><br />\nHii<br /><br />\nIIIIjI<br />\nf<br /><br />\nMerion\u2014Dempsey (c) left tiddle; Saint, center tiddle; Abbl, right<br />\ntiddle.<br />\nFounders\u2014Logan, left tiddle; De<br />\nMott, center tiddle; Chadwick (c)<br />\nright tiddle.<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nRev.

The<br />\nmatter has been referred to the Interfraternity Council and immediate action is demanded. Warrants<br />\nfor individual students will be<br />\nsworn in if necessary, and several<br />\nof the more active frats fear a<br />\nveritable reign of terror if the Police Superintendent makes good his<br />\nthreat of issuing search warrants<br />\nfor every Lehigh frat house.
