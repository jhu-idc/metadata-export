Yet, \"cartoonists<br />\nare not taken seriously,\" said<br />\nLane, though adding that there<br />\nis a doctoral thesis on editorial<br />\ncartooning in the MSE Library.<br />\n\"We [editorial cartoonists]<br />\nare not a serious bunch,\" Lane<br />\nsaid. \"We do have a convention every year,\" Lane added,<br />\n<br />\nbut the 150 cartoonists meet in<br />\nplaces like Disneyworld in<br />\nOrlando, or in the Del Coronado Hotel in San Diego<br />\n(where the film Some Like It<br />\nHot was filmed). \"You won't<br />\nfind us having a convention in<br />\nToledo,\" he said.<br />\nOne reason why Lane might<br />\nnot be taken seriously is<br />\nbecause of his typical day:<br />\nFrom 7:15 a.m. to 12 p.m. he<br />\nreads the Washington Times,<br />\nPost and the Baltimore Sun,<br />\nsketches, and fools around.<br />\nLane said, \"I do for a living<br />\nwhat most people dream of doing, but I was training in school<br />\nfor years,\" he joked.

An editorial<br />\ncartoon must be specific<br />\nenough to make its point, yet<br />\n<br />\ngeneral enough to be<br />\nunderstood, and topical enough<br />\nto be relevant. \"I had this<br />\nknack of predicting the news<br />\nwhen I was younger, and my<br />\neditor had this knack of tearing<br />\nup my cartoons,\" said Lane.<br />\nRegarding the self-styled role<br />\nof the editorial cartoonist, Lane<br />\nsaid, \"There isn't one.\" It's<br />\nsimply \"to draw cartoons and<br />\nbe a part of the paper.\" The<br />\ncartoon is the \"quick fix\" and<br />\ndoesn't say \"here, read this,\"<br />\nbut \"look here for a minute,\"<br />\nLane added.<br />\nWhen asked if changes in<br />\npolitics and politicians had any<br />\neffect on his work, Lane said,<br />\n\"Dull politicians make dull cartoons.

But like most of<br />\nDixon's protagonists, he is<br />\ndoomed to failure, and instead<br />\nonly finds a woman who likes<br />\nher independence, and has<br />\ngiven up her children to her exhusband.<br />\nIn most of Dixon's works,<br />\nsexual and occasionally violent<br />\ndescriptions are important if<br />\nnot key in setting the tone of<br />\nthe stories, being dealt with<br />\ncasually and explicitly without<br />\neuphemisms.<br />\nDixon then introduced his<br />\nnext selection, \"Tastes,\" which<br />\nwas written last June and was<br />\ninspired by, \"an event that actually happened in New York.\"<br />\nThe story is one of a rape and<br />\nmurder of a student studying in<br />\nNew York, and is told<br />\nsimultaneously through the five<br />\nmain characters.<br />\nThe third selection,\"A Parting,\" Dixon introduced by saying, \"This one's a little<br />\nlivelier.\" It compared to<br />\n\"Taste\" in that sex and<br />\nviolence, although as widely used in both stories, did not appall the listeners, but instead<br />\nhumored them.<br />\n<br />\nIMMI RATION<br />\nATTORNEYS<br />\nImmigrant Visas\u2014<br />\n\"Green Cards\"<br />\n<br />\nThe final reading, \"Grace<br />\nCalls,\" displayed almost Steinian characteristics, with its two<br />\nto five word sentences, some of<br />\nwhich were often repeated<br />\nthroughout the work.<br />\nA typical passage from the<br />\nstory, \"I read.

When asked<br />\nabout his start in writing, Dixon explained, \"I was a journalist, a newsman, with nothing<br />\n<br />\nto do at night but drink and<br />\nread.\"<br />\nAfter writing both poetry<br />\nand fiction, Dixon explained<br />\nthat \"I had to make a decision\"<br />\nbetween the two. Since, as he<br />\nsaw it, his poetry was too prosaic, \"too much like my fiction\" he decided to \"put my<br />\npoems in a plastic garbage bag<br />\nand put them on the curb for<br />\nthe sanitation department to<br />\npick up.\"<br />\nDixon, a prolific writer with<br />\neight books published in ten<br />\nyears and another to come out<br />\nsoon, was a meticulous reader<br />\npaying careful attention to the<br />\ntone of his reading, and<br />\ndisplaying a perfectionist<br />\ntendency when he repeated a<br />\nsingle line from a story three<br />\ntimes to make sure the inflection was correct.<br />\n<br />\nDamien Doute<br />\n<br />\nStephen Dixon, novelist and short story writer, who read from his collected works before a packed audience on Wednesday night.<br />\n<br />\nEVEN BEFORE COMMENCEMENT,<br />\nYOU COULD BEGIN USING<br />\nME AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD.<br />\n<br />\nLabor Certifications<br />\nNonimmigrant Visas fo<br />\nstudents, tourists and tent<br />\nporary wprkers<br />\nDefense against deportatio<br />\nU.S. Citizenship<br />\n<br />\nGershberg<br />\n<br />\nHoneyman &Pearl<br />\nSuite 702\u2014Title Building<br />\n110 St. Paul Street,<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland 2120<br />\n(301) 837-2$50<br />\n<br />\ns soon as you get a job, ou could<br />\nget the American Express' ard.<br />\nIf you're a senior, all you need is<br />\nto accept a $10,000 career-oriented job.<br />\nThat's it.

But when we sent a<br />\nreporter, they threw him out. Part of the<br />\nmeeting was going to be secret, they said,<br />\nso the News-Letter would have to leave.<br />\nWe objected to that, and the GRO has<br />\nsince reversed itself and passed a resolution stating that all their meetings will be<br />\nopen in the future. That was clearly the<br />\nright thing to do, but this whole matter<br />\nhas reminded us that a dual injustice remains: 1) while student groups that are<br />\nmembers of the Student Activities Commission are forbidden from having closed meetings, so-called student government groups can constantly hide from<br />\nview if they wish to, and 2) the administration constantly closes all of the<br />\nmeetings of its important bodies.<br />\nNot counting the GRO, there are two<br />\nkey student groups not covered by the<br />\nSAC regulations: the Student Council<br />\nand the Inter-Fraternity Council.<br />\nAlthough the Council, to its credit, does<br />\nnot currently hold closed meetings, it was<br />\nless than a decade ago that this<br />\nnewspaper's reporters were being<br />\nphysically thrown out of Council<br />\nmeetings. Furthermore, there is no provision in the SC's constitution prohibiting closed meetings. The IFC is far<br />\nworse: it does in fact regularly close its<br />\nmeetings.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no defense for the IFC's closed meetings, and there would be none if<br />\nthe Council were to try such a thing.<br />\nBoth groups claim to represent students<br />\nin one form or another, and surely those<br />\nstudents have a right to know what their<br />\nrepresentatives do.<br />\nThe administration is guiltier still.<br />\nThere is no reason, for example, the<br />\nmeetings of the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies or the Academic<br />\nCouncil should be closed, as they have<br />\nbeen for years. Both these organizations<br />\ndeal largely with academic matters such<br />\nas curriculum changes. Surely those sorts<br />\nof things aren't so important that they<br />\nmust be kept secret.<br />\nWe don't anticipate that the council<br />\nwill try to close any of its meetings, and<br />\nwe don't mean to lump it with the administration and the IFC (Even the<br />\ncouncil doesn't deserve that company.)<br />\nBut to insure that closed meetings don't<br />\npop up in the future, the council ought<br />\nto follow the SAC's lead and amend its<br />\nown constitution to forbid closed<br />\nmeetings. And what of the IFC and the<br />\nadministrative committees such as the<br />\nCUS? Well, they should, but won't,<br />\nopen their meetings. We doubt there is<br />\nanything we can say to convince them,<br />\nbut that doesn't make them any less<br />\nwrong.<br />\nOf all places, a university ought to be<br />\na forum for an open exchange of ideas,<br />\nnot smoke-filled rooms.

Since, to be<br />\nboth honest and immodest,\u2022 the News-<br />\n<br />\nLetter is the main forum for publicizing<br />\ncampus issues and events, many students<br />\nhear little or nothing about the elections<br />\nuntil that Friday's paper.

In spite<br />\nof this, international studies remains a sub-department of the<br />\npolitical science department it<br />\nnow dwarfs.

The report of the<br />\nEducation committee has<br />\nalready had an impact, and<br />\nsince then other student concerns have been communicated<br />\nto faculty and administration.<br />\nIn early December, Pi Sigma<br />\nAlpha, the political science<br />\nhonor society, sponsored a<br />\nmeeting with Associate Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences Matthew<br />\nCrenson, and Political Science<br />\nprofessors Rourke, David and<br />\nDoyle.

More than fifty<br />\nstudents from Goucher, Johns<br />\nHopkins and Towson State<br />\ndecided to shell out the money<br />\nto do something completely<br />\nnew after New Year's.

It was a<br />\ngreat trip, but it wasn't great<br />\nthe way a trip to Bermuda is.<br />\nOf course, as the people on<br />\nthe trip can well attest, any wild<br />\n<br />\nexperience has its share of problems. If countries were colors,<br />\nthe Soviet Union would be the<br />\ncolor grey, not red. The sun<br />\nwas seen only about twice the<br />\nwhole time we were in Russia<br />\nand it snowed often. Also, we<br />\nfound out quickly that the<br />\nthings people might want are<br />\nalmost completely unavailable<br />\nin the USSR. A walk down<br />\nNevsky Prospect, the Russian<br />\nequivalent to Fifth Avenue<br />\nrevealed only bread stores, bad<br />\nshoe stores, clothes stores with<br />\nshoddy merchandise and book<br />\nstores with no classic books.

That's part of the<br />\nreason that Patricia Brooks, a<br />\njunior psychology major at<br />\nHopkins, seized an opportunity to visit much-mentioned<br />\nNicaragua and see what was<br />\nhappening there for herself.<br />\n<br />\n\"I was overcome<br />\nby guilt at the embassy...1 felt<br />\nashamed to be an<br />\nAmerican at<br />\ntimes.\"<br />\n\u2014Patti Brooks<br />\nThe opportunity was provided<br />\nby St. James Methodist Church<br />\nin Baltimore which sponsors<br />\ngroup trips to Nicaragua for<br />\neducational purposes and to<br />\nvisit the newly founded Casa<br />\nBaltimore, an independent<br />\ngoodwill organization. It serves<br />\nas a communications link between Baltimore and her sister<br />\ncity in Nicaragua, San Juan de<br />\nLimay.<br />\n\"As soon as I heard about<br />\n<br />\n[the trip], I felt I would really<br />\nenjoy going there,\" Brooks<br />\nsaid. \"I'm not normally a very<br />\npolitical person, but I felt that<br />\nas an interested citizen it was a<br />\ngood chance to learn more.\"<br />\nThere were ten people on the<br />\ntrip of all different types\u2014a<br />\nminister and his wife, a priest,<br />\nsome social workers, a lawyer,<br />\nand a machinist.

The head of Brooks'<br />\nhost family was a \"vigilante\",<br />\na person employed by the Sandinistas to watch out for the<br />\ncontras and any anti-goverment<br />\nactivities.<br />\nBrooks said that San Juan<br />\nwasn't one of the war-strifed<br />\ncities seen in the media so many<br />\ntimes: \"You never see the contras.\" She said that the<br />\nvigilante who sponsored her<br />\n\"probably spends most of his<br />\nday at the government building<br />\n<br />\nmeeting with an economic adsmoking cigarettes.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the most visor at the embassy.

Students<br />\nspeak guardedly about romance,<br />\nand while they say it is there for<br />\n, people who really try, it's not<br />\na priority in their lives.<br />\n\"It's not that love is dead,<br />\nbut it takes a back seat to studying,\" said senior John Burke.<br />\n\"People don't have to use<br />\nheadaches as an excuse. They<br />\nhave exams.\"<br />\nAn anonymous senior woman<br />\nsaid relationships were shaped<br />\nby study habits.<br />\n\"It's better not to be in the<br />\nsame major\u2014there is the competitiveness factor, and you<br />\nhave to take all your classes<br />\ntogether,\" she said. She and her<br />\nboyfriend have study dates in<br />\norder to find time for each<br />\nother. Yet she has noticed people tend not to be \"super<br />\nserious\" since they will part<br />\nafter senior year for graduate<br />\nschool.<br />\nIf people choose not to study<br />\n<br />\nwith their romantic partners<br />\nthey tend to pick them just for<br />\nfun. Rumours of one-night<br />\nstands in the stacks of the MSE<br />\nabound. Senior women are<br />\nbeginning to go out with<br />\nfreshmen for \"flings,\" according to the anonymous female.<br />\n\"Freshmen are so wonderful<br />\nand unjaded,\" she said.<br />\nToby Mordkoff, who graduated in December, says<br />\nHopkins encourages shallow<br />\nrelationships.<br />\n\"It's easier to have a onenight stand than a relationship,\" he said. \"The social<br />\nmood is horrendous. Hopkins<br />\nhas gotten colder.\"<br />\nMordkoff has undergone a<br />\nromantic evolution of sorts.<br />\nFirst he was interested in a<br />\ntraditional boyfriend-girlfriend<br />\nideal. Now he wants a \"lover<br />\nwith a capital L\u2014you admit to<br />\nyour sex drive, but are in a relationship where personal aspects<br />\nare not as important as sleeping<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nHe says lovers may rendezvous up to three nights a week,<br />\n<br />\nbut do not seek each other out<br />\nat other times for friendly<br />\nactivities.<br />\n\"Relationships aren't safe at<br />\nHopkins,\" he said. \"There's an<br />\natmosphere of head games and<br />\npower trips.\"<br />\nBurke agrees there is competitiveness, especially among<br />\nmen for women.<br />\n\"Guys give up when one of<br />\nthem makes progress with<br />\nanother girl,\" he said. He<br />\nthinks people who aren't in<br />\nrelationships are either scared<br />\nto get involved, or are busy<br />\nstudying.<br />\nAlthough students may<br />\nsound negative about love at<br />\nHopkins, futures do not depend on the slim pickings on<br />\ncampus.<br />\n\"Out of a few million guys,<br />\nthere are many Mr. AlmostRights,\" the female said. And<br />\nshe carries a copy of the Kama<br />\nSutra in her backpack as a jest.<br />\n\"At this school, I found it on<br />\nsale for 99 cents,\" she said.<br />\n<br />\nBlowing It Off in Bologna<br />\nby Carrie Mook<br />\nMost Hopkins students know<br />\nabout the graduate School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies<br />\n(SAIS), and about its Italian<br />\ncampus in Bologna. What you<br />\nmay not know is that each year<br />\nsix to twelve Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates have the opportunity to participate in this<br />\nprogram.<br />\nBecause the Bologna Center<br />\nis a graduate institution,<br />\neligibility is limited to upperlevel students, particularly<br />\njuniors, majoring in history, international relations, or<br />\npolitical economy. Classes are<br />\nconducted in English, but an intensive class in Italian in<br />\nSeptember gives students a<br />\nworking knowledge of the<br />\nlanguage. All students pay ,<br />\nregular Hopkins tuition plus<br />\ntravel and living expenses, but<br />\nfinancial aid is available.<br />\nTerry Cook, one of the eight<br />\nHopkins seniors who went on<br />\nthe program last year, was enthusiastic: \"All our group<br />\nadapted really well and had a<br />\ngreat time.\" She called the trip<br />\n\"educational\" in more ways<br />\nthan one. Besides doing<br />\ngraduate-level course work,<br />\nparticipants had a chance to<br />\ntravel, to meet people from all<br />\nacross America and Europe,<br />\nand to become part of the<br />\nItalian community.<br />\nThe eight Homewood<br />\nstudents were the only<br />\nundergraduates at SAIS. They<br />\nfound the classes difficult but<br />\ninteresting. Most of the professors were European, and<br />\n<br />\ntheir style of teaching took<br />\nsome getting used to for the<br />\nAmerican students. For example, they liked oral exams. But<br />\nthe professors were mostly<br />\ngood, and as Cook said, \"If<br />\nyou didn't mind working, you<br />\nhad plenty of time for other<br />\nthings, like travelling.\"<br />\nIf you want to travel in Italy, Bologna is a good place to<br />\nbe. Centrally located, it is an<br />\nhour and a half from Florence<br />\nand a few hours from Vienna.<br />\nIt is fairly easy, and surprisingly<br />\ninexpensive for students to<br />\ntake off for a long weekend and<br />\nexplore. Ned Neuberger and his<br />\nfriends arranged their schedules<br />\nso that alternate Thursdays and<br />\nFridays were free, and went on<br />\ntrips through Germany, Italy,<br />\nand the rest of Europe: \"We<br />\nlived in the most abominable<br />\nconditions possible, and slept<br />\non trains a couple of times to<br />\nsave money, but we could do<br />\nfive days for $100. It was<br />\ngreat!\" There were schoolsponsored trips as well, including one to Poland. Apparently SAIS pays for a couple of Polish graduate students<br />\neach year in return for being<br />\nallowed a group trip.<br />\nBeing in Bologna is an education in itself. SAIS can be a<br />\nworld in itself, and some student made close friends in the<br />\nschool community. Others went<br />\ninto the city and became part of<br />\nit. Cook spent most of her free<br />\ntime with Italians. She said, \"I<br />\nwas their American friend, and<br />\nthat made me special. They got<br />\nclose to me quickly.\"<br />\nThe best part of the program<br />\n<br />\nwas living there. She said, \"Our<br />\napartment was beautiful. Marble floors, three bedrooms, two<br />\nterraces, half an hour's walk<br />\nfrom campus(there was a shuttle), and $150 a month. And the<br />\nelevator always worked!\"<br />\nThere were a few adventures involved in setting up housekeeping, like trying to buy a washing<br />\nmachine before they learned<br />\nmuch Italian.<br />\nAfter classes,\"We hung out,<br />\nsaid Neuberger, \"Italy is a<br />\nhang-out sort of country. I<br />\nplayed soccer some with my<br />\nItalian friends, and we went to<br />\nthe beer hall.\"<br />\nCook agreed, \"The osteria<br />\nwas a big thing. It's sort of a<br />\nclub, and people drink beer,<br />\nand someone will bring a deck<br />\nof cards, or someone will bring<br />\na guitar and everyone sings.<br />\nNed sang a lot. If he hadn't<br />\nbrought his guitar, someone<br />\nwould find one for him.\"<br />\nWalking and shopping were<br />\nother ways of passing time.<br />\nWindow-shopping was fun, but<br />\n\"don't walk into a store unless<br />\nyou know more or less what<br />\nyou want and plan to buy<br />\nsomething. If you walk around<br />\nand touch things and ask about<br />\nprices and try them on, you'd<br />\nbetter buy something or they'll<br />\nget irritated,\" Cook said.<br />\nNeuberger and Cook both<br />\nliked the program and recommend it.

In the subway in particular, Russians take<br />\npart in a mass slam dance, barrelling into each other and<br />\npushing against each other until there is absolutely no more<br />\nroom on a train. There are no<br />\npleasantries exchanged to<br />\nrelieve the tension either. As we<br />\ngregarious Americans learned,<br />\na smile is greeted with a cold<br />\nlook of hostility. And forget<br />\nservice with a smile; Russian<br />\npeople behind the counter freely engage in lone tirads (which<br />\nwere pretty ineffective since<br />\nnone of us ever knew what they<br />\nwere saying), and angry<br />\ngesticulations at the slightest<br />\nconfusion or problem.<br />\nThose of us who got to know<br />\nsome Russians privately learned<br />\nthat they can be very nice and<br />\nvery fun but that their idea of<br />\nfun centers around a bottle of<br />\nvodka to an alarming degree.<br />\nThe Russians I met got drunk<br />\nevery day. I don't think this is<br />\na symptom of general bliss.<br />\nWe didn't have to worry<br />\nabout spending money on food<br />\nfor three weeks. There are<br />\nalmost no restaurants in<br />\nMoscow or Leningrad so we ate<br />\nregular Russian meals in the<br />\nhotels. These consisted of beets,<br />\ncabbage, greasy potatoes and<br />\nsome kind of fatty, tough meat<br />\nwe affectionately called yak.<br />\nWe experienced this fare<br />\nroughly every day for lunch and<br />\ndinner.<br />\nThese were not pleasant<br />\naspects of the trip, but they<br />\nwere important experiences if<br />\none wants to understand the<br />\nparadox that is Russia. The trip<br />\nwas not just a difficult learning<br />\nexperience however. We were<br />\nspared the harsh reality of the<br />\nSoviet Union to go to several<br />\nshows. There were two trips to<br />\nthe Bolshoi, one to the Kremlin<br />\nDance Theatre, one to the<br />\nKirov Opera and a small one to<br />\nthe Leningrad Philharmonic.<br />\nI'm not an opera or a ballet fan<br />\nand the Kirov didn't change my<br />\nmind about opera, but the<br />\nBolshoi proved to me that if<br />\nyou watch the best in the world<br />\n<br />\ndo something, it's hard not to<br />\nenjoy it.<br />\nOn the lighter side, there was<br />\nthe Moscow Circus. Most<br />\neverybody on the trip had a<br />\nblast watching trick horseriding, bears playing hockey,<br />\nand two clowns jabbering their<br />\nroutines in a foreign language.<br />\nWe went to see many museums,<br />\nthe Hermitage and Russian<br />\nMuseum in Leningrad in particular, which were very good.<br />\nIt's hard to say what the best<br />\npart of the trip was. I think that<br />\nfor a lot of people spending<br />\ntime with a fun group in a completely alien place was the most<br />\nfun. For me, getting drunk with<br />\nthe Russian guys with whom we<br />\nmade friends was special. It was<br />\na matter of acting completely<br />\ncrazy in a crazy place with some<br />\ncrazy people from the most<br />\nforeign of foreign countries.<br />\nThough I think we all had a<br />\ngood time in the Soviet Union,<br />\neverybody on the trip was happy to come home to pizza,<br />\nLevis, attractive and polite people, and friends.

For some time, there<br />\nwas a question as to whether it<br />\nwould ever get to see the light<br />\nof day in this country, at least<br />\nin its current form.<br />\nBrazil was financed by Arnon Milchan, and set to be<br />\ndistributed in the United States<br />\nby Universal Pictures; but when<br />\nGilliam presented Universal<br />\nwith his finished product, they<br />\ndid not like what they saw. Sid<br />\nSheinberg of Universal insisted<br />\nthat the film should be reedited,<br />\nbut Gilliam held firm to his<br />\nown vision of the movie. When<br />\na stalemate was reached, Universal put Brazil on the shelf.<br />\nGilliam, annoyed with the idea<br />\nof his film not being released in<br />\nthe U.S., actually contemplated<br />\nsponsoring viewings of Brazil in<br />\nMexico to be attended by audiences bussed in from<br />\nCalifornia.<br />\nSuch drastic measures would<br />\nnot be needed. A special screening of Brazil was arranged in<br />\nthis country for Los Angeles<br />\ncritics, who left so enthusiastic<br />\nabout the work that they voted<br />\nit the best film of 1985. Universal's desire to reedit was obviously eclipsed by their visions<br />\nof dollar signs and added<br />\n<br />\nprestige, so they scrambled to<br />\nhave the film released in New<br />\nYork and around the country in<br />\ntime to have it qualify for the<br />\nAcademy Awards. It is now up<br />\nfor the Best Original Screenplay<br />\nand Best Art Direction Oscars;<br />\nsuch awards would be welldeserved indeed.<br />\nFor those who are familiar<br />\nwith Terry Gilliam's name but<br />\nare unable to place it, he is<br />\nprimarily known for being one<br />\nsixth of Monty Python,<br />\nalthough he is certainly a filmmaker in his own right, with<br />\nsuch films as Monty Python<br />\nand the Holy Grail(co-directed<br />\nwith Terry Jones), Jabberwocky, and Time Bandits to his<br />\ncredit. The only Python of<br />\nAmerican origin, Gilliam does<br />\nnot appear in many of the<br />\ngroup's sketches but he does<br />\nkeep his on-screen presence felt<br />\nby being the man behind the<br />\nMonty Python animation (see<br />\nthe opening credit sequence of<br />\n\"Life of Brian\" for what may<br />\nbe his most notable exercise in<br />\nanimation to date).<br />\nAs could be expected from<br />\nsuch a clever, colorful<br />\nanimator, Gilliam presents us<br />\nwith some terrifically stunning<br />\nvisuals in what can be termed<br />\nhis personal version of \"1984.\"<br />\nThe film<br />\ntakes<br />\nplace<br />\n\"Sometime in the 20th century;\" the scene is a<br />\nnightmarish \"future world\" of<br />\n<br />\nsorts, but it is a future where<br />\nstyles and technology were not<br />\nallowed to progress past the<br />\nforties and fifties. Mind control<br />\nis the way of life, and posters<br />\nseen throughout the film<br />\ndisplay the philosophy of the<br />\nall-dominating Ministry of Information: \"Suspicion Breeds<br />\nConfidence,\" \"Don't Suspect a<br />\nFriend\u2014Report Him,\"_ and the<br />\nlike. Computers, old-time<br />\ntelevision, and endless paperwork characterize life in this<br />\nunnamed metropolis where<br />\never-present and unsightly<br />\nducts must have some greater<br />\npurpose than the mere transfer<br />\nof hot air.<br />\nThe screenplay, written by<br />\nGilliam, Charles McKeown,<br />\nand playwright Tom Stoppard<br />\n(Rosencrantz and Gildenstern<br />\nare Dead, and more recently,<br />\nThe Real Thing) details the life<br />\nof Sam Lowrie (Jonathan<br />\nPryce), a worker in the<br />\nMinistry's<br />\nInformation<br />\nRetrieval department who is<br />\nsatisfied with being no more<br />\nthan a number in society. The<br />\nfreedom he lacks he makes up<br />\nfor in his dreams, where he envisions himself a winged warior continually coming to the<br />\nfescue of a most heavenly fair<br />\nmaiden.<br />\nRobert DeNiro has the<br />\nsmaller role of Archibald Tuttle, a heating engineer sick of<br />\nthe system. No longer willing to<br />\n<br />\ndeal with the limitless Central<br />\nServices paperwork, Tuttle<br />\nbecomes a renegade repairman,<br />\nproviding much-needed work<br />\non people's broken air conditioning without first receiving<br />\nproper clearance from the<br />\nauthorities. As a result, Tuttle<br />\nis seen as a subversive who must<br />\nbe eliminated, but he always<br />\nmanages to stay one step ahead<br />\nof the law. When the computer<br />\nprints out the instructions for<br />\nTuttle's arrest, a bug in the<br />\nprinter (literally) causes his<br />\nname to be printed as \"Buttle\"<br />\ninstead, resulting in the termination of Archibald Buttle,<br />\na poor but devoted husband<br />\nand family man.<br />\nJill Leyton (Kim Greist), a<br />\npolitically radical truck-driving<br />\nneighbor of the Buttles, wants<br />\nto correct this obvious miscarriage of \"justice\" before it is<br />\ntoo late. Her efforts bring her<br />\nto the Ministry of Information,<br />\nwhere she is spotted by Sam<br />\nLowrie, who realizes that<br />\nLeyton just so happens to be a<br />\nshort-haired version of the<br />\nwoman of his dreams. The normally unambitious Lowrie accepts a promotion arranged by<br />\nhis affluent mother (Katherine<br />\nHelmond, and, yes, those are<br />\nshoes that she wears on her<br />\nhead) only so that he can gain<br />\naccess to classified information<br />\nabout his mystery woman. But<br />\nwhen Lowrie becomes obsessed<br />\n<br />\nin his search for the woman he<br />\nloves, he is pegged as being a<br />\nradical himself.<br />\nGilliam has done some<br />\nfascinating, even stunning<br />\nthings with the visuals<br />\nthroughout the film. I,owrie's<br />\ndream sequences are highlights,<br />\nand things reach a stunning<br />\npeak at the film's end, in an<br />\nodd sequence that flows<br />\nsmoothly and beautifully from<br />\none scene to the next. The sheer<br />\nbizarreness of much of the film,<br />\nboth in storyline and imagery,<br />\nbetrays the existence of a<br />\nPython in the director's chair.<br />\nBut while the film is hardly<br />\nwithout humor, it is also not<br />\ncomedy through and through,<br />\nand, without spoiling anything,<br />\nit does not end in the way you<br />\nmight hope it would.<br />\nBrazil is a fine film on many<br />\nlevels, and is far from being for<br />\nMonty Python fans alone. In<br />\nfact, expecting a Monty Python<br />\ncomedy will only leave you<br />\ndisappointed. Says Gilliam,<br />\nBrazil is \"About the impossibility of escaping from<br />\nreality,\" and that's not exactly<br />\na knee-slapper of a topic. But<br />\nBrazil is worth seeing, and<br />\ndeserves to be seen all the same.<br />\nAfter all, it must be a highquality, intelligent feature; if it<br />\nwasn't, why would Universal<br />\ntry to stop its release?<br />\n<br />\nDazzling 42nd Street in 4-week run at Mechanic<br />\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\nDepending on your point of<br />\nview, spectacle is hard to come<br />\nby these days or it is overwhelming in its abundance. TV,<br />\nwith its constantly growing<br />\nvolume, beat, and flourescent<br />\ncolor provides an endless supply of spectacle; on the other<br />\nhand, there seems to be a lot<br />\nless around to be truly awed<br />\nby\u2014less that makes you sit<br />\nback and go, \"wow . ..\"42nd<br />\nStreet is pure spectacle, of the<br />\nsort that's been missing lately.<br />\nApparently, this show (and<br />\nthis is definitely a show, not a<br />\nplay) has broken all kinds of<br />\nrecords at the Mechanic<br />\nTheatre Box Office and it's<br />\neasy to see why\u2014it's really a<br />\nwonderful thing to watch and<br />\nlisten to. Those who came<br />\nopening night expecting dazzling original dance numbers<br />\ncould not have been disappointed; those who expected<br />\neven a semblance of an intelligent plot had to have<br />\nbeen\u2014but that's not the point.<br />\nTo this kind of show, a plot is<br />\nsimply supplementary.<br />\nWhat plot does exist concerns producer Julian Marsh<br />\n(played by showbiz veteran<br />\nBarry Nelson\u2014a ringer for a<br />\ntall Earl Weaver)and his efforts<br />\nto put on a show during the<br />\nDepression. Gail Benedict plays<br />\nPeggy Sawyer, the inevitable<br />\nsmall town girl who comes<br />\nfrom nowhere to save the show<br />\n<br />\nand Tony award-winner<br />\nDolores Gray plays Dorothy<br />\nBrock, a spoiled showbiz<br />\nlegend. The show's weakest<br />\nlinks probably lie in its casting<br />\nas both Nelson and Gray seem<br />\nfar too old for their roles. For<br />\nexample, there is a hint of a<br />\nromantic relationship between<br />\nJulian and Peggy which tends<br />\nto make one cringe as Nelson is<br />\ntwice as old as Gail Benedict.<br />\nAlso, when Peggy takes over<br />\nthe leading role from Dorothy,<br />\nshe fits perfectly into her<br />\ncostumes\u2014even<br />\nthough<br />\nDolores Gray is shaped like<br />\nEthel Merman and Benedict<br />\ncertainly isn't. But then again,<br />\nas Broadway continues to<br />\ndecline, I imagine it is inevitable<br />\nthat the real \"name\" stars are<br />\ngoing to come from farther and<br />\nfarther in the past. In reality,<br />\nhowever, Gail Benedict makes<br />\na far greater impression than<br />\neither Nelson or Gray, the two<br />\n\"names\", playing Peggy with<br />\nthe exact amount of exaggerated spunk required of the<br />\nrole\u2014and there is certainly no<br />\ndoubt that she can sing and<br />\ndance, and sing and dance well.<br />\nNevertheless, 42nd Street is<br />\nmost impressive for its ensemble dancing than for its individual performances. In a<br />\nway, the set pieces and musical<br />\nnumbers are the real stars of the<br />\nshow. The dance numbers start<br />\nout with a bang\u2014the colorful<br />\n\"Audition\"\u2014and build in<br />\nspectacularity until the<br />\nfinale\u2014\"42nd Street,\" a<br />\n<br />\nmassive number with the lights<br />\nof Braodway as a backdrop. In<br />\nbetween these two numbers, the<br />\nmusical pieces range from the<br />\nclever \"Shadow Waltz,\"<br />\nfeaturing dancing silhouettes;<br />\nto the flashy \"Dames,\" featuring mirrors and sequins; to the<br />\nracy \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo,\"<br />\nfeaturing a newly-wed couple<br />\nand a host of lingerie-clad<br />\n\"dancers.\" Much of the music<br />\n(written by the team of Warren<br />\nand Dubin) is familiar\u2014<br />\n\"We're in the Money,\"<br />\n\"Lullaby of Broadway,\" and<br />\nof course \"42nd Street,\" but<br />\nmost of it isn't familiar, which<br />\nis nice in many respects.<br />\nIf there is a problem with this<br />\nproduction, it lies in the way the<br />\nobviously inferior plot interferes with the musical<br />\nqualities. Unlike .the standard<br />\nmusical, the first act doesn't<br />\nend with a bang but on a down<br />\nnote. In the same way, the show<br />\ndoesn't really end with the<br />\nfinale but on a melancholy, sentimental reprise of \"42nd<br />\nStreet\" sung by Julian Marsh.<br />\nThe writers evidentally were<br />\ntrying to avoid the show<br />\nbusiness cliches but let's face it,<br />\na musical is hardly fine art and<br />\npure crowd pleasing is certainly no sin.<br />\nBut on the whole, the show<br />\nis great. Besides the good performances of Barry Nelson and<br />\nDolores Gray, and especially<br />\nGail Benedict, one is treated to<br />\nthe comic talents of Denise Lor<br />\nand Don Potter. as the in-<br />\n<br />\nPress Photo<br />\n<br />\nBarry Nelson as producer 'Julian Marsh.' All you trivia buffs know him<br />\nas the first James Bond. No kidding.<br />\n<br />\nevitable male-female songwriting team, and Kevin Daly<br />\nas the egotistical leading man.<br />\nOpening night was not without<br />\nits glitches; for example, during<br />\na sentimental moment between<br />\nJulian and Peggy near the end<br />\nof the play, out of nowhere<br />\ncame a voice asking \"Will someone get to the house lights<br />\nright now?\"\u2014exposing the<br />\ndangers of miking a stage.<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, the show is a success and is definitely worth seeing. Whether half-price rush<br />\ntickets are ever going to be<br />\navailable for this show remains<br />\nto be seen, due to its Advance<br />\npopularity, but it is worth trying to get them. The show will<br />\nbe in Baltimore until March 8.<br />\nCall 625-1400 for ticket<br />\ninformation.<br />\n<br />\n\f*****************************************<br />\nld<br />\nln<br />\n<br />\n14/FEBRUARY 14, 1986<br />\n<br />\nSign up now for Jazzyersize<br />\n<br />\nDance Class!!<br />\nSpring Semester<br />\n21 1 hr. sessions for $38.00 (plus $2.00<br />\nnon-refundable registration fee)<br />\nTuesdays (7pm-8pm) and Thursdays<br />\n(6pm-7pm) Classes begin February 18,<br />\nAthletic Center Dance Room.

Wu<br />\n<br />\nAutobiography seems to get<br />\naway with much more than<br />\nmost literary forms. Few people are not amenable to a little<br />\nphilosophizing and only impatient readers insist on fast action and stylish wordplay. But<br />\nat the same time, life stories of<br />\nthe rich and famous are hardly<br />\nboring. So in our time, we have<br />\nslick, heavily-marketed accounts of successes by<br />\nhousehold names like Ferraro<br />\nand Iacocca topping the bestseller lists. Then, without any<br />\nghost author credit in small<br />\nprint, along comes Entrances,<br />\nAn American Director's<br />\nJourney by the late Alan<br />\nSchneider. Mr. Schneider was<br />\none of America's formeost<br />\ntheatre directors, having done<br />\nWho's Afraid of Virginia<br />\nWoolf? among other major<br />\nplays. Entrances was to be only the first volume of his<br />\nautobiography, delivered to<br />\nViking Penguin a scant nine<br />\ndays before his death.<br />\nThis book narrates an entirely different sort of success, with<br />\nvivid little scenes. The language<br />\nisn't fussy, but neither does it<br />\nread as an oral history might.<br />\nIt has a quality of being<br />\nmoderate, balanced between a<br />\nrich ornate style and a lean<br />\nsparse style. This complements<br />\nthe content well. Mr. Schneider<br />\nis aware he is telling us a story,<br />\nin his case a true personal story,<br />\nand he is unhampered by the<br />\n<br />\nwriting itself.<br />\nMr. Schneider's childhood<br />\nwas filled with unhappy incidents, presented here without<br />\nmelodrama, almost too easy to<br />\nread. There is a natural quality<br />\nof having gotten over trauma.<br />\nA recurring early memory is of<br />\nhis mother struggling to get<br />\ncod-liver oil for the young<br />\nAlan,<br />\nthen<br />\nAbram<br />\nLeopoldovitch Schneider, son<br />\nof two young doctors struggling in Revolutionary Russia.<br />\nBut the child was not appreciative of this important part<br />\nof his diet...After a perilous<br />\njourney through paperwork,<br />\nhis family emigrated to<br />\nAmerica. When the other<br />\nchildren were evil in the way<br />\nchildren are, making fun of his<br />\nbeing Jewish and actually attacking him, he recounts that<br />\nhe learned to run fast, \"a skill<br />\nthat later helped me as a track<br />\nman in high school and college.<br />\nNothing is without its compensations.\" This exemplifies the<br />\nrelative absence of emotion<br />\nthroughout the book.<br />\nLater, he lived in Baltimore<br />\nand spent a great deal of time<br />\nsurreptitiously reading science<br />\nfiction (then less respectable<br />\nthan pornography) and watching movies. He writes that he<br />\nmight have read a play or two,<br />\nbut at the time his \"contemporary theatre was on film.\"<br />\nThen he happened to be invited<br />\nto see a play. Immediately,<br />\nthere began an obsession.<br />\nMr. Schneider first attended<br />\nJohns Hopkins; his parents<br />\nbelieved he would follow them<br />\ninto medicine. Instead, he<br />\nstruggled with physics, decided<br />\nto become a journalist and then<br />\nthought to transfer to University of Michigan. He ended up<br />\n<br />\nat Wisconsin, where he tried<br />\nout for many plays and was<br />\nnever cast in a leading role. So<br />\nhe wound up directing and<br />\ndistinguishing himself for producing a dramatic adaptation<br />\nof a story without having the<br />\nlegal rights to do so.<br />\nAfter \"First Acts,\" Alan<br />\nenters the real world and the<br />\nbook becomes a detailed<br />\nmemoir of his struggling career.<br />\nHe writes about his not having<br />\nheld a regular job and then<br />\nusually receiving two offers at<br />\nonce. He seemed to always get<br />\ntwo proposals and of course,<br />\nthe job he did choose never<br />\nlasted long. The book describes<br />\nmany events, without being too<br />\nconcerned with a life<br />\nphilosophy or even a<br />\nphilosophy of directing.<br />\nUnfortunately, the later sections are also considerably less<br />\ninteresting to read then the<br />\nglimpses of childhood. There is<br />\nless humor, less personality and<br />\nonly the theatre. A few episodes<br />\nof life break up the lone introduction to the crazy world of<br />\nAmerican drama. He loses his<br />\nvirginity, gets married, has<br />\nchildren, suffers a few personal<br />\nlosses and the show goes on.<br />\nPerhaps because there are a<br />\nmultitude of characters, none<br />\nof the players in \"Second Acts\"<br />\nbecomes three-dimensional.<br />\nNot even his wife Eugenie<br />\nMuckle takes on any<br />\ndistinguishable persona. Action<br />\ntakes place, but little character<br />\ndevelopment does. For an<br />\nautobiography, this is acceptable if the author reveals some<br />\nof his thoughts. Alan Schneider<br />\ndoes only a fair job of depicting<br />\nhis inner thoughts. Odd, given<br />\nthat he favored acting<br />\nmotivated by internal action,<br />\n<br />\nrather than acting based upon<br />\nexternals.<br />\nHe reveals very little about<br />\nhis private life, only slightly<br />\nmore about the task of directing and a word or two about<br />\neach of the dozens of notable<br />\nactors and actresses he has<br />\nworked with. As this goes on,<br />\nthe parade of actors go by. Mr.<br />\nScneider takes care to always<br />\nmention that a particular<br />\nfavorite has previously worked<br />\nwith him in this play or that. If<br />\nhe did not append these notices<br />\nto the actors, even an attentive<br />\nreader would probably fail to<br />\ntake note of these facts, each<br />\nactor being reduced to two<br />\nthings, a real name and a stage<br />\nname.<br />\n\"Third Acts\" continues with<br />\nWaiting For Godot, a valiant<br />\neffort which was an immediate<br />\nfailure in a posh Miami<br />\nplayhouse not known for plays,<br />\nbut for its fancy restaurant.<br />\nThis production began Alan<br />\nSchneider's association with<br />\nserious drama in America. He<br />\nbecame the first choice as director for Beckett, Pinter and Edward Albee's work. The discussion of \"meaning\" in the work<br />\nof this trio is limited, with notes<br />\nhere and there and references to<br />\nthe immense quantity of communications between both<br />\ndirector and playwright used in<br />\nproducing the play. Perhaps<br />\nthose scraps of ideas would<br />\nhave made for a more revealing<br />\nanalysis of theatre.<br />\nNow and then there appears<br />\nan allusion to Mr. Schneider's<br />\nreputation for a quick and nasty<br />\ntemper,<br />\nbut<br />\nthe<br />\nautobiography is by this time<br />\nstriking for its lack of emotion.<br />\nEven the death of Mr.<br />\nSchneider's father does not carry<br />\n<br />\nthe full impact it should. This<br />\nis not a fault of the writing<br />\nstyle, but rather a result of the<br />\nbook's focus. This is a book<br />\nabout the theatre life of Alan<br />\nSchneider, not about the personal life of Alan Schneider.<br />\nEven so, his ideal of an<br />\nAmerican theatre is not explored, there is only a cursory<br />\ndiscussion of theatre criticism<br />\nand the book is limited to the<br />\nimmediate vicinity of the stag:.<br />\nThis constraint is brokea,<br />\nthough only occasionally.<br />\nSamuel Beckett comes alive and<br />\nthere is a Buster Keaton, still<br />\nliving in 1927. Despite the<br />\nlimited range of what Alan<br />\nSchneider is willing to reveal,<br />\nthe writing always sustains the<br />\nmaterial, so the book is not dry<br />\nreading. This volume ends in<br />\nthe late 1960s, with Alan finally established at the age of<br />\nforty-nine, directing his greatest<br />\ncommercial success, a set of one<br />\nacts by Robert Anderson.<br />\nWhen the American public<br />\nbothers to read, light reading is<br />\nthe<br />\nfirst<br />\nchoice.<br />\nAn<br />\nautobiography of this sort<br />\nwould need to be superlative to<br />\nattract attention. For the reader<br />\nwith catholic tastes, there are<br />\nfar too many good books for<br />\neven a book reviewer to finish<br />\nin a lifetime. There are even a<br />\nfair number of well-written<br />\nbiographies brought out every<br />\nyear. Entrances is a welcome<br />\nbreak from the glossy celebrity<br />\ndiary, starting off with an interesting childhood but managing only a partially satisfactory<br />\n388 pages. For almost the cost<br />\nof a show, this genuine<br />\nautobiography is recommended<br />\nto those who are attracted to its<br />\nsubtitle, An American Director's Journey.<br />\n<br />\nGreeley's Religion That Turns The Pages<br />\nAngels of September.<br />\nby Andrew M. Greeley<br />\na Bernard Geis Associates book<br />\n$17.95, 451 pages<br />\nby Howell Sasser<br />\nWhatever happened to the<br />\ngood old days? Time was when<br />\nthere were demons on every<br />\nside, just waiting for the good<br />\nChristian to make a false move,<br />\nand then...POW! He was<br />\ndragged away kicking and<br />\nscreaming to the fiery pits of<br />\nHell never to be heard from<br />\nagain. One can only imagine<br />\nthat Church attendance was<br />\npretty good.<br />\nOf course, today we know<br />\nbetter. It can be scientifically<br />\nproven that: God is dead, the<br />\ndevil was a hoax played on<br />\nstupid peasants, and that Sunday morning is the best time to<br />\nget space on the tennis courts.<br />\nThe vacuum left in our ability<br />\nto deal with everyday traumas<br />\nby the absence of the Church<br />\ncan be adequately filled with a<br />\npsychiatrist (worshipping at the<br />\naltar of psychoanalysis).<br />\n<br />\nBut what of those who live in<br />\nboth worlds? That is, those<br />\nwho continue to accept the<br />\nRoman Catholic teaching on<br />\nthe existence of God and of sin;<br />\nand at the same time function<br />\nin the real world, complete with<br />\nanalyst and a \"modern\" and<br />\ntherefore in the Church's eyes,<br />\nsometimes \"sinful\" lifestyle.<br />\nWhat might happen if a<br />\nmodern person chose (unconsciously) to interpret the<br />\nevents of what by modern standards would be a normal life<br />\nthrough the eyes of her not<br />\nwholly modern Church? Could<br />\nthere be demons in the world of<br />\nhigh technology? These are the<br />\nquestions addressed in Father<br />\nAndrew Greeley's latest novel,<br />\nThe Angels of September.<br />\nThe modern person already<br />\nmentioned is a woman in early<br />\nmiddle age named Anne Reilly;<br />\nbut perhaps it was stretching<br />\nthe truth a little to call her life<br />\nnormal. She has been married<br />\nand divorced twice and has had<br />\nan affair which would have led<br />\nto a third marriage, had the<br />\nChurch not forbidden it, and<br />\n<br />\nhad she not obeyed. Indeed, the<br />\nChurch has appeared at some<br />\ncrucial point in each of her relationships, and has each time<br />\nacted against her in a way<br />\nwhich would have left others<br />\nwithout faith. She is made to<br />\nfeel personally guilty and<br />\nresponsible for each failure, a<br />\ntrait which she already displays<br />\nin her feelings toward her<br />\nchildren.<br />\nHer greatest manifestation of<br />\nguilt feelings is, however, not<br />\nrelated to any experience in her<br />\nadult life. It is, rather, her fear<br />\nthat she was responsible for a<br />\nfire in her elementary school<br />\nwhich killed seventy of her<br />\nclassmates. Wrapped up in her<br />\nrecollections of this event is the<br />\nparish priest, Desmond Kenny.<br />\nHe continues to reappear<br />\nthroughout the novel, and is in<br />\nfact the impetus for all the action of the book. Everything<br />\ncenters around an exhibition of<br />\nartworks by Kenny being put<br />\non in Anne Reilly's gallery.<br />\nGreeley lets on that Father Kenny went insane at some point in<br />\nhis career, and this is said to ex-<br />\n<br />\nplain any oddities in his art.<br />\nHowever, strange events begin<br />\nto take place. Fires break out \"...she was responsithat only Anne can see. The<br />\nble for a fire in her<br />\ntelephone rings and only Anne<br />\ncan hear it. Worst of all, the elementary school<br />\nscene in one of the more which killed seventy<br />\ngraphically violent paintings,<br />\ncalled \"Divine Justice,\" seems of her classmates.\"<br />\nto be moving to Anne. As if this<br />\nweren't enough, an explosion in<br />\nthe gallery brings police inspec- mouthpiece of Andrew<br />\ntor Michael Casey into Anne's Greeley, preacher, the message<br />\nlife, or more exactly back into usually doesn't stomp off the<br />\nit. Anne and Mike have had page and slap the reader silly (a<br />\nwhat Greeley calls a \"psychic familiar event with some of the<br />\nromance\" ever since they fell other \"theme novelists\").<br />\nAs in past novels, he occainto a snow bank together in<br />\nsionally goes out on a<br />\nthe seventh grade.<br />\nIf all this seems hard to theological limb, such as when<br />\nfollow, it is only because lack he takes his customary jabs at<br />\nof space and a respect of John Cardinal Cody. But, in<br />\nsuspense prevent me putting in the end, orthodox Catholic<br />\nall the salient story lines, thought wins out. All the<br />\nGreeley has no such restric- \"good\" characters remain in<br />\ntions, and uses ample space to the Church, faith intact.<br />\nrecord every minute detail. He Religion nonwithstanding,<br />\nuses various narrative devices Angels is still a good book of<br />\nwith great success, and the sort that make you stay up<br />\nmanages to make his chracters until odd hours to read just one<br />\nthree dimensional enough that more chapter.

Ironically,<br />\nDr. Henderson did an experiment there that verified that it<br />\nonly takes about 15 seconds to<br />\nvaccinate someone.<br />\nPart of the problem was<br />\ncaused by the fact that the industrialized countries had forced<br />\ntheir pattern of health care on<br />\nan area where it was totally inappropriate. Dr. Henderson<br />\ncited a beautiful hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia that has<br />\nover 500 beds and all the latest<br />\nmedical equipment, but lacks<br />\nsufficient staff and is within<br />\nthree days travel for only 3 percent of the country's population. The same problem occurred in Monrovia, Liberia.<br />\nThere, the Swiss ended up staffing the hospital..<br />\nThis was the situation that<br />\nfaced Dr. Henderson in 1967<br />\nwhen, as a member of WHO,<br />\nhe decided to eliminate the<br />\nsmallpox virus once and for all.<br />\nHis attack was two-pronged: to<br />\nvaccinate 80 percent of the<br />\npopulation with lab-tested vaccine, and to contain any outbreaks of the disease.<br />\nThe main stumbling block<br />\nfor the immunization program<br />\n<br />\nwas the general lack of interest<br />\nand motivation. As Dr.<br />\nHenderson said, \"If a child has<br />\na broken leg, it is not unusual<br />\nfor his mother to carry him 10<br />\nor 20 miles to a doctor, but we<br />\nwere lucky to get 50 percent of<br />\nthe people within a mile [come<br />\nto be vaccinated].\" Also, as in<br />\nthe case of the hospital in Iran,<br />\ncaring for the sick people left<br />\nno time for the seemingly less<br />\nurgent task of immunization.<br />\nTo get around this problem,<br />\nteams were sent out to each<br />\nvillage in the afflicted countries<br />\nand told to go door-to-door if<br />\nnecessary to achieve their<br />\nquota. Then, an investigative<br />\nteam was sent to do a random<br />\nsampling of 10 percent solely to<br />\ndetermine if 80 percent of the<br />\nvillagers had received their vaccinations. Almost immediately,<br />\nareas which had been sending<br />\nback very low results because<br />\n\"the women are in purdah and<br />\nwill not allow male vaccinators<br />\nto touch them or their<br />\nchildren\" suddenly began<br />\nreporting results of nearly 90<br />\npercent.<br />\nSurprisingly enough, the<br />\ncampaign actually required very<br />\nlittle money and manpower.<br />\nThe total operating cost was 8<br />\nmillion dollars a year, corn-<br />\n<br />\nNew AIDS Unit Opens at Hopkins<br />\nThe inpatient staff consists<br />\nof, for the most part, those who<br />\nOn February 4th of this year, volunteer to help these patients<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Medical In- and of those whose research institutions opened its inpatient terests are related to this<br />\nAIDS program.

In<br />\nMaryland, the number of cases<br />\nthus far was 276, of which 171<br />\nhave already died.<br />\n<br />\npared to the 1 to 2 billion that<br />\nare saved each year on hospital<br />\nbills and childhood immunizations. Afghanistan, with a<br />\npopulation of 18 million people, required a staff of only 100<br />\npeople, and Kenya only required 45. In the whole campaign, only one employee was<br />\nlost, and that was due to a car<br />\naccident. In response to a question, Dr. Henderson said that<br />\nhis staff was able to be so effective because, although they<br />\nwere given strong support, they<br />\nwere given a flexible set of<br />\nguidelines rather than a<br />\n\"recipe.\" Each group had to<br />\ndevelop a strategy that was<br />\nspecifically tailored for the<br />\ncountry they were in.<br />\nIn commemoration of its fortieth anniversary, the UN has<br />\nagain made a commitment to<br />\n\"the world and all its peoples.\"<br />\nIn a little-noted declaration in<br />\n1985, the UN stated that<br />\n[through WHO]it will provide<br />\nfor universal child immunization and the elimination of<br />\nthe Western'<br />\npolio in<br />\nHemisphere by 1990.<br />\nJoining the general trend<br />\ntoward more preventive<br />\nmedicine, in January of '85,<br />\nJohns Hopkins expanded its<br />\nresearch faculty in this area to<br />\nover 65 scientists, two to three<br />\ntimes that of any other institution in the world.

As Dr. Henderson<br />\nconcluded, \"the goal of the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth is to put the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital out of<br />\nbusiness.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/19<br />\n<br />\nSports,<br />\nBlackened Blue Jays Absorb Tough Defeat<br />\nNapping Boys Of Winter Look To Come Out Of Hibernation Tomorrow<br />\nby Craig Brooks<br />\n<br />\nhas never happened before so<br />\nthe Blue Jays 50-48 loss to<br />\nWidener this past Saturday is<br />\nindeed a precedent.<br />\nFor the Guiness people, here<br />\nare the facts on the Hopkins<br />\ndefense:<br />\n*The Jays held Widener's<br />\nlethal scorer Lou Stevens to 16<br />\npoints, six of which were from<br />\nthe free throw line.<br />\n*The Jays had 64 shots<br />\nwhile the Pioneers got off only<br />\n<br />\n43.<br />\n*Widener hit only five shots<br />\nfrom the floor in the second<br />\nhalf, shooting only 25 percent.<br />\n\"Great scorers put people in<br />\nthe seats and fast break slams<br />\n*Hopkins collected 10 steals<br />\nbring them to their feets but<br />\nas a team and Ralph Horne had<br />\ndefense wins games.\"<br />\n5 blocked shots.<br />\nYes, ladies and gentlemen,<br />\n*The Jays still lost the game<br />\nthe Hopkins Men's Hoops<br />\n50-48!<br />\nteam has once again set a preceTeam defense was executed,<br />\ndent.

They were,<br />\nyou recall, our last three Olympic basketball coaches, though<br />\nGavitt had to take a rain check<br />\nbecause President Carter<br />\nthought by not going to<br />\nMoscow for the 1980 Games<br />\nthat the Russian bear would<br />\nrelease his hug on Afghanistan.<br />\nFrom the top, let's realize<br />\nthat if the Eastern Bloc nations<br />\nhad been present at LaLa Land<br />\nlast year, we would have only<br />\nreceived about 65 percent of the<br />\ngold that we did. Look to South<br />\nKorea to be the first true Olympics in 12 years since Dean<br />\nSmith brought back the basketball trophy from Montreal in<br />\n'76.<br />\nNow, as to the selection of<br />\nthe coach.<br />\nThe selection process is a<br />\nsimple one. The Olympic<br />\nBasketball Committee, which is<br />\nmade up of 16 people, recommends seven or eight candidates<br />\nto the United States Olympic<br />\nCommittee, which makes the<br />\nfinal selection.<br />\nHere are things the Committee must keep in mind, when it<br />\nmakes up its list:<br />\nFirst, the coach obviously<br />\nhas to be a Division I coach<br />\nbecause he has to be visible, to<br />\ncommand the respect of the<br />\nfuture NBA millionaires temporarily under his command.<br />\nAnd, he has to be Caesar's<br />\nwife, above suspicion. There<br />\ncan be no investigation and no<br />\npossible probation lurking over<br />\nhis shoulder from the NCAA.<br />\nFinally, the committee<br />\nshould remember that one of<br />\nthe biggest assets American<br />\nplayers have over players from<br />\nthe rest of the world is defense.<br />\nSo their choice should be a<br />\ncoach who is defensiveoriented, who is known for his<br />\nability to teach good team<br />\ndefense.<br />\nThe point is: No matter who<br />\n<br />\nIcemen Fight Tooth And Nils<br />\nby Andy Gray<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS TANNING<br />\nSALE: ONE YEAR UNLIMITED'<br />\nMEMBERSHIP<br />\nONLY $200.00<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nTAN NOW<br />\nLocated at the Hopkins House<br />\n110W. 39th Si.<br />\n10 Sessions $30.00<br />\n1 month unlimited $40.00<br />\nCal for detath 089-4163<br />\nOn, Free Session with Purchase<br />\n<br />\narea's finest<br />\n<br />\nHaircutting<br />\n3333n. charles<br />\n<br />\nniffierro.

Because whoever the<br />\ncoach is, he must have this twoyear period to go through the<br />\nprocedure of selecting the team,<br />\nand picking his assistants for<br />\ntheir ability, not from the good<br />\nol' boy system.<br />\nMost importantly, our Olympic coach must have time to<br />\nfamiliarize the players with international play during the next<br />\ntwo summers. He must be able<br />\nto pick a couple of trial teams<br />\nto be sent out in the summer of<br />\n'87, so the players can learn the<br />\nins and outs of international<br />\nplay, and become aware of<br />\nwhat happens when you're not<br />\nplaying on your own block, like<br />\nwe did in '84.<br />\nOne major problem that the<br />\nround ball fan is not aware of<br />\nis that the 1988 Games are being played from Sept. 17 to<br />\nOct. 2. How are we going to get<br />\nthe NBA to allow first round<br />\ndraft choices, a la Danny Manning, to play on the Olympic<br />\nteam when their NBA schedule<br />\nis starting up? And how are the<br />\nuniversities going to allow<br />\nballplayers to go into training<br />\nand miss the first 11<br />\n/<br />\n2 months of<br />\nschooling?<br />\nDon't get me wrong. These<br />\nproblems can be solved. But it's<br />\ntime to get the machinery in<br />\nprocess. Picking the coach is<br />\nthe first step. He's the fountainhead, the ramrod, to pull<br />\nthings together, get things<br />\n<br />\norganized through the NBA,<br />\nthe NCAA, the college<br />\npresidents, and the players.<br />\nThere are some prerequisites:<br />\nThe college presidents must set<br />\nup a tutoring system for the<br />\nplayers. The NBA must allow<br />\na grace period for all seniors<br />\nthat year. The players have to<br />\nmake a firm commitment by<br />\nthe end of their junior year.<br />\nAnd the NCAA and the Olympic Committee must get<br />\ntogether, as governing bodies,<br />\nto iron out any problems that<br />\nmay arise.<br />\nAs far as the Games go, I still<br />\nbelieve the basketball competition will be a two-horse race<br />\nbetween the USSR and the<br />\nUSA, but only if we can put the<br />\ncaliber of players and coaches<br />\non the floor, like we did in '84.<br />\nHere's my list of eight candidates for the job, in<br />\nalphabetical order, I think the<br />\nCommittee should recommend:<br />\nLarry Brown, Kansas; Denny<br />\nCrum, Louisville; Charles<br />\nDreisell (who doesn't want to<br />\nbe called Lefty), Maryland;<br />\nGuy Lewis, Houston; Lute<br />\nOlson, Arizona; Digger Phelps,<br />\nNotre Dame; Eddie Sutton,<br />\nKentucky; and John Thompson, Georgetown.<br />\nThe above-named coaches<br />\nhave all the necessary ingredients: The long contracts with<br />\nthe universities, the TV exposure, the credibility with the<br />\nplayers, the knowledge, and all<br />\nhave had some experience with<br />\ninternational coaching. Also,<br />\nthey all have one of the most<br />\nimportant things, the staff inside<br />\ntheir<br />\nbasketball<br />\ndepartments\u2014the office inside<br />\nan office, if you will\u2014that<br />\nallows them the tremendous<br />\namount of time required to get<br />\neverything in place.

Well, here's<br />\na new kind of puzzle for you. Each of the sentences or phrases is<br />\na clue to one word. The clues often, though net always, involve<br />\nanagrams or puns. The two words for row one have 15 letters between them (i.e., they go all the way across the puzzle), but you don't<br />\nknow where la stops and lb starts(word a always preceeds word b).<br />\nSo all you have to do is fill in all 20 worth (two in each row)correctly. As an added hint, the first letter of all the words, taken in order<br />\n(la through 10b), spells out a phrase. Whether you get the phrase<br />\nor not won't count\u2014it will merely help you to get the first letter of<br />\neach word. One more thing\u2014iii of the words have something to do<br />\nwith good 'ol JHU,so this will test not only your word-game ability,<br />\nbut also your knowledge of Hopkins trivia. Got all that?

But when we sent a<br />\nreporter, they threw him out. Part of the<br />\nmeeting was going to be secret, they said,<br />\nso the News-Letter would have to leave.<br />\nWe objected to that, and the GRO has<br />\nsince reversed itself and passed a resolution stating that all their meetings will be<br />\nopen in the future. That was clearly the<br />\nright thing to do, but this whole matter<br />\nhas reminded us that a dual injustice remains: 1) while student groups that are<br />\nmembers of the Student Activities Commission are forbidden from having closed meetings, so-called student government groups can constantly hide from<br />\nview if they wish to, and 2) the administration constantly closes all of the<br />\nmeetings of its important bodies.<br />\nNot counting the GRO, there are two<br />\nkey student groups not covered by the<br />\nSAC regulations: the Student Council<br />\nand the Inter-Fraternity Council.<br />\nAlthough the Council, to its credit, does<br />\nnot currently hold closed meetings, it was<br />\nless than a decade ago that this<br />\nnewspaper's reporters were being<br />\nphysically thrown out of Council<br />\nmeetings. Furthermore, there is no provision in the SC's constitution prohibiting closed meetings. The IFC is far<br />\nworse: it does in fact regularly close its<br />\nmeetings.<br /><br />\nThere is no defense for the IFC's closed meetings, and there would be none if<br />\nthe Council were to try such a thing.<br />\nBoth groups claim to represent students<br />\nin one form or another, and surely those<br />\nstudents have a right to know what their<br />\nrepresentatives do.<br />\nThe administration is guiltier still.<br />\nThere is no reason, for example, the<br />\nmeetings of the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies or the Academic<br />\nCouncil should be closed, as they have<br />\nbeen for years. Both these organizations<br />\ndeal largely with academic matters such<br />\nas curriculum changes. Surely those sorts<br />\nof things aren't so important that they<br />\nmust be kept secret.<br />\nWe don't anticipate that the council<br />\nwill try to close any of its meetings, and<br />\nwe don't mean to lump it with the administration and the IFC (Even the<br />\ncouncil doesn't deserve that company.)<br />\nBut to insure that closed meetings don't<br />\npop up in the future, the council ought<br />\nto follow the SAC's lead and amend its<br />\nown constitution to forbid closed<br />\nmeetings. And what of the IFC and the<br />\nadministrative committees such as the<br />\nCUS? Well, they should, but won't,<br />\nopen their meetings. We doubt there is<br />\nanything we can say to convince them,<br />\nbut that doesn't make them any less<br />\nwrong.<br />\nOf all places, a university ought to be<br />\na forum for an open exchange of ideas,<br />\nnot smoke-filled rooms. Hopkins' motto says that \"The Truth Will Set You<br />\nFree.\" It surely can't do so if it is being<br />\nconcealed.<br /><br />\nSome Election Reforms<br />\nLike the swallows returning to<br />\nCapistrano, there are some things that<br />\nhappen every year. Around Homewood,<br />\none of those is some complaining that<br />\nnobody paid attention to the Student<br />\nCouncil elections.<br />\nFor as long as we can remember,<br />\npeople\u2014most noticeably the Elections<br />\nCommission and the candidates\u2014have<br />\ngriped that the elections go largely unnoticed. This newspaper covers the<br />\nthings insufficiently. Nobody (literally)<br />\ncomes to the Candidates' Forum. Except<br />\nfor the freshmen, far too few people<br />\nvote.<br />\nSome of that seemed to change last<br />\nyear, when expanded coverage in these<br />\npages and a tight, unpredictable threeway race for the council Presidency<br />\nlivened things up.<br />\nStill, the main problem with the election process persists. There simply is not<br />\nenough time for people to become really interested in the races. Traditionally,<br />\ncandidates' petitions are due on a given<br />\nTuesday at 5 p.m. The Elections Commission then verifies the petitions, and<br />\nthe official list of candidates is available<br />\nsometime Tuesday evening. Since, to be<br />\nboth honest and immodest,\u2022 the News-<br /><br />\nLetter is the main forum for publicizing<br />\ncampus issues and events, many students<br />\nhear little or nothing about the elections<br />\nuntil that Friday's paper. And since Friday's paper is put together Wednesday<br />\nand Thursday, there is frequently too little time to cover the elections to the extent we would like.<br />\nAfter people read about the elections<br />\nin Friday's paper, they have only four<br />\ndays until the vote\u2014hardly enough time<br />\nfor an interesting campaign to develop.<br />\nSo how about a little electoral reform?<br />\nWe suggest the Elections Commission<br />\nmove the date petitions are due up a<br />\nweek this year. Students would then have<br />\na week-and-a-half to decide who they<br />\nwant to vote for, and a true campaign<br />\nmight develop. Furthermore, this<br />\nnewspaper would publish twice between<br />\nthe time the petitions are due and the<br />\nvoting, allowing for more extensive<br />\ncoverage.<br />\nWe haven't suggested our proposal to<br />\nElections Commission Chairman Scott<br />\nTurner; we merely offer it as something<br />\nto think about.

Unfortunately, it does<br />\nnot look like this situation is going to change in the near<br />\nfuture\u2014unless demands for<br />\nprovement are made.<br />\nIn the last two years the<br />\nenrollment in the international<br /><br />\nstudies were introduced\u2014in<br />\ndepartments ranging from<br />\nhistory to sociology. These<br />\ncourse are excellent additions,<br />\nbut they can only be viewed as<br />\na beginning, and not a<br />\ndefinitive cure.

In spite<br />\nof this, international studies remains a sub-department of the<br />\npolitical science department it<br />\nnow dwarfs. The root of the<br />\nproblem is that not enough<br />\nmoney has been allocated to<br />\nimproving and expanding<br />\nprogram.<br />\nFortunately, there are many<br />\nintermediate steps to be taken<br />\nuntil new sources of money can<br />\nbe found. Last year the Student<br />\nCouncil Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Education<br />\nwrote a report summarizing the<br />\nproblems with the major\u2014its<br />\nlack of departmental identity,<br />\nthe lack of tenured professors,<br />\nand the need for a simple explanation of requirements and<br />\ngoals, to name a few. As a<br />\nresult, Steven David was named<br />\ncoordinator of the international studies program, and<br />\nMichael Doyle wrote a booklet<br />\nexplaining the program.<br />\nWhile those improvements<br />\nare important and essential,<br />\nmany more short-term improvements can be made.

The report of the<br />\nEducation committee has<br />\nalready had an impact, and<br />\nsince then other student concerns have been communicated<br />\nto faculty and administration.<br />\nIn early December, Pi Sigma<br />\nAlpha, the political science<br />\nhonor society, sponsored a<br />\nmeeting with Associate Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences Matthew<br />\nCrenson, and Political Science<br />\nprofessors Rourke, David and<br />\nDoyle. At that meeting students<br />\nasked questions, and made suggestions on solving problems<br />\nranging from course needs to<br />\nadvising. What is needed now<br />\nis a renewed student drive to<br />\nimprove the international<br />\nstudies program.<br />\nIn the coming weeks Pi<br />\nSigma Alpha will sponsor<br />\nmeetings and petition drives to<br />\nfurther the cause of improving<br />\nthe international studies program.

A threeweek trip to the Soviet Union is<br />\na walk on the wild side I'm glad<br />\nI took.<br />\nThis past intersession the<br />\nRussian department at Goucher<br />\nCollege sponsored a trip to the<br />\nSoviet Union. More than fifty<br />\nstudents from Goucher, Johns<br />\nHopkins and Towson State<br />\ndecided to shell out the money<br />\nto do something completely<br />\nnew after New Year's. I was<br />\ncrazy enough to be one of those<br />\n50-plus adventurers.<br />\nGuided by an ebulliant Russian woman named Zina who<br />\ncould reel off facts and anecdotes about Russian in a funny<br />\npigeon English until they have<br />\nanother revolution, we spent<br />\ntwo weeks in Moscow and one<br />\nweek in Leningrad. It was a<br />\ngreat trip, but it wasn't great<br />\nthe way a trip to Bermuda is.<br />\nOf course, as the people on<br />\nthe trip can well attest, any wild<br /><br />\nexperience has its share of problems. If countries were colors,<br />\nthe Soviet Union would be the<br />\ncolor grey, not red. The sun<br />\nwas seen only about twice the<br />\nwhole time we were in Russia<br />\nand it snowed often. Also, we<br />\nfound out quickly that the<br />\nthings people might want are<br />\nalmost completely unavailable<br />\nin the USSR. A walk down<br />\nNevsky Prospect, the Russian<br />\nequivalent to Fifth Avenue<br />\nrevealed only bread stores, bad<br />\nshoe stores, clothes stores with<br />\nshoddy merchandise and book<br />\nstores with no classic books. In<br />\naddition, Russian bars close by<br />\nabout nine o'clock. The best<br />\nthings are available only in<br />\nhard-currency stores which are<br />\nopen only to foreigners.

That's part of the<br />\nreason that Patricia Brooks, a<br />\njunior psychology major at<br />\nHopkins, seized an opportunity to visit much-mentioned<br />\nNicaragua and see what was<br />\nhappening there for herself.<br /><br />\n\"I was overcome<br />\nby guilt at the embassy...1 felt<br />\nashamed to be an<br />\nAmerican at<br />\ntimes.\"<br />\n\u2014Patti Brooks<br />\nThe opportunity was provided<br />\nby St. James Methodist Church<br />\nin Baltimore which sponsors<br />\ngroup trips to Nicaragua for<br />\neducational purposes and to<br />\nvisit the newly founded Casa<br />\nBaltimore, an independent<br />\ngoodwill organization. It serves<br />\nas a communications link between Baltimore and her sister<br />\ncity in Nicaragua, San Juan de<br />\nLimay.<br />\n\"As soon as I heard about<br /><br />\n[the trip], I felt I would really<br />\nenjoy going there,\" Brooks<br />\nsaid. \"I'm not normally a very<br />\npolitical person, but I felt that<br />\nas an interested citizen it was a<br />\ngood chance to learn more.\"<br />\nThere were ten people on the<br />\ntrip of all different types\u2014a<br />\nminister and his wife, a priest,<br />\nsome social workers, a lawyer,<br />\nand a machinist.

The head of Brooks'<br />\nhost family was a \"vigilante\",<br />\na person employed by the Sandinistas to watch out for the<br />\ncontras and any anti-goverment<br />\nactivities.<br />\nBrooks said that San Juan<br />\nwasn't one of the war-strifed<br />\ncities seen in the media so many<br />\ntimes: \"You never see the contras.\" She said that the<br />\nvigilante who sponsored her<br />\n\"probably spends most of his<br />\nday at the government building<br /><br />\nmeeting with an economic adsmoking cigarettes.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the most visor at the embassy.

Students<br />\nspeak guardedly about romance,<br />\nand while they say it is there for<br />\n, people who really try, it's not<br />\na priority in their lives.<br />\n\"It's not that love is dead,<br />\nbut it takes a back seat to studying,\" said senior John Burke.<br />\n\"People don't have to use<br />\nheadaches as an excuse. They<br />\nhave exams.\"<br />\nAn anonymous senior woman<br />\nsaid relationships were shaped<br />\nby study habits.<br />\n\"It's better not to be in the<br />\nsame major\u2014there is the competitiveness factor, and you<br />\nhave to take all your classes<br />\ntogether,\" she said. She and her<br />\nboyfriend have study dates in<br />\norder to find time for each<br />\nother. Yet she has noticed people tend not to be \"super<br />\nserious\" since they will part<br />\nafter senior year for graduate<br />\nschool.<br />\nIf people choose not to study<br /><br />\nwith their romantic partners<br />\nthey tend to pick them just for<br />\nfun.

He<br />\nthinks people who aren't in<br />\nrelationships are either scared<br />\nto get involved, or are busy<br />\nstudying.<br />\nAlthough students may<br />\nsound negative about love at<br />\nHopkins, futures do not depend on the slim pickings on<br />\ncampus.<br />\n\"Out of a few million guys,<br />\nthere are many Mr. AlmostRights,\" the female said.

What you<br />\nmay not know is that each year<br />\nsix to twelve Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates have the opportunity to participate in this<br />\nprogram.<br />\nBecause the Bologna Center<br />\nis a graduate institution,<br />\neligibility is limited to upperlevel students, particularly<br />\njuniors, majoring in history, international relations, or<br />\npolitical economy. Classes are<br />\nconducted in English, but an intensive class in Italian in<br />\nSeptember gives students a<br />\nworking knowledge of the<br />\nlanguage. All students pay ,<br />\nregular Hopkins tuition plus<br />\ntravel and living expenses, but<br />\nfinancial aid is available.<br />\nTerry Cook, one of the eight<br />\nHopkins seniors who went on<br />\nthe program last year, was enthusiastic: \"All our group<br />\nadapted really well and had a<br />\ngreat time.\" She called the trip<br />\n\"educational\" in more ways<br />\nthan one. Besides doing<br />\ngraduate-level course work,<br />\nparticipants had a chance to<br />\ntravel, to meet people from all<br />\nacross America and Europe,<br />\nand to become part of the<br />\nItalian community.<br />\nThe eight Homewood<br />\nstudents were the only<br />\nundergraduates at SAIS. They<br />\nfound the classes difficult but<br />\ninteresting. Most of the professors were European, and<br /><br />\ntheir style of teaching took<br />\nsome getting used to for the<br />\nAmerican students. For example, they liked oral exams. But<br />\nthe professors were mostly<br />\ngood, and as Cook said, \"If<br />\nyou didn't mind working, you<br />\nhad plenty of time for other<br />\nthings, like travelling.\"<br />\nIf you want to travel in Italy, Bologna is a good place to<br />\nbe. Centrally located, it is an<br />\nhour and a half from Florence<br />\nand a few hours from Vienna.<br />\nIt is fairly easy, and surprisingly<br />\ninexpensive for students to<br />\ntake off for a long weekend and<br />\nexplore. Ned Neuberger and his<br />\nfriends arranged their schedules<br />\nso that alternate Thursdays and<br />\nFridays were free, and went on<br />\ntrips through Germany, Italy,<br />\nand the rest of Europe: \"We<br />\nlived in the most abominable<br />\nconditions possible, and slept<br />\non trains a couple of times to<br />\nsave money, but we could do<br />\nfive days for $100. It was<br />\ngreat!\" There were schoolsponsored trips as well, including one to Poland. Apparently SAIS pays for a couple of Polish graduate students<br />\neach year in return for being<br />\nallowed a group trip.<br />\nBeing in Bologna is an education in itself. SAIS can be a<br />\nworld in itself, and some student made close friends in the<br />\nschool community. Others went<br />\ninto the city and became part of<br />\nit. Cook spent most of her free<br />\ntime with Italians. She said, \"I<br />\nwas their American friend, and<br />\nthat made me special. They got<br />\nclose to me quickly.\"<br />\nThe best part of the program<br /><br />\nwas living there. She said, \"Our<br />\napartment was beautiful. Marble floors, three bedrooms, two<br />\nterraces, half an hour's walk<br />\nfrom campus(there was a shuttle), and $150 a month. And the<br />\nelevator always worked!\"<br />\nThere were a few adventures involved in setting up housekeeping, like trying to buy a washing<br />\nmachine before they learned<br />\nmuch Italian.<br />\nAfter classes,\"We hung out,<br />\nsaid Neuberger, \"Italy is a<br />\nhang-out sort of country. I<br />\nplayed soccer some with my<br />\nItalian friends, and we went to<br />\nthe beer hall.\"<br />\nCook agreed, \"The osteria<br />\nwas a big thing. It's sort of a<br />\nclub, and people drink beer,<br />\nand someone will bring a deck<br />\nof cards, or someone will bring<br />\na guitar and everyone sings.<br />\nNed sang a lot. If he hadn't<br />\nbrought his guitar, someone<br />\nwould find one for him.\"<br />\nWalking and shopping were<br />\nother ways of passing time.<br />\nWindow-shopping was fun, but<br />\n\"don't walk into a store unless<br />\nyou know more or less what<br />\nyou want and plan to buy<br />\nsomething. If you walk around<br />\nand touch things and ask about<br />\nprices and try them on, you'd<br />\nbetter buy something or they'll<br />\nget irritated,\" Cook said.<br />\nNeuberger and Cook both<br />\nliked the program and recommend it.

In the subway in particular, Russians take<br />\npart in a mass slam dance, barrelling into each other and<br />\npushing against each other until there is absolutely no more<br />\nroom on a train. There are no<br />\npleasantries exchanged to<br />\nrelieve the tension either. As we<br />\ngregarious Americans learned,<br />\na smile is greeted with a cold<br />\nlook of hostility. And forget<br />\nservice with a smile; Russian<br />\npeople behind the counter freely engage in lone tirads (which<br />\nwere pretty ineffective since<br />\nnone of us ever knew what they<br />\nwere saying), and angry<br />\ngesticulations at the slightest<br />\nconfusion or problem.<br />\nThose of us who got to know<br />\nsome Russians privately learned<br />\nthat they can be very nice and<br />\nvery fun but that their idea of<br />\nfun centers around a bottle of<br />\nvodka to an alarming degree.<br />\nThe Russians I met got drunk<br />\nevery day. I don't think this is<br />\na symptom of general bliss.<br />\nWe didn't have to worry<br />\nabout spending money on food<br />\nfor three weeks. There are<br />\nalmost no restaurants in<br />\nMoscow or Leningrad so we ate<br />\nregular Russian meals in the<br />\nhotels. These consisted of beets,<br />\ncabbage, greasy potatoes and<br />\nsome kind of fatty, tough meat<br />\nwe affectionately called yak.<br />\nWe experienced this fare<br />\nroughly every day for lunch and<br />\ndinner.<br />\nThese were not pleasant<br />\naspects of the trip, but they<br />\nwere important experiences if<br />\none wants to understand the<br />\nparadox that is Russia. The trip<br />\nwas not just a difficult learning<br />\nexperience however. We were<br />\nspared the harsh reality of the<br />\nSoviet Union to go to several<br />\nshows. There were two trips to<br />\nthe Bolshoi, one to the Kremlin<br />\nDance Theatre, one to the<br />\nKirov Opera and a small one to<br />\nthe Leningrad Philharmonic.<br />\nI'm not an opera or a ballet fan<br />\nand the Kirov didn't change my<br />\nmind about opera, but the<br />\nBolshoi proved to me that if<br />\nyou watch the best in the world<br /><br />\ndo something, it's hard not to<br />\nenjoy it.<br />\nOn the lighter side, there was<br />\nthe Moscow Circus. Most<br />\neverybody on the trip had a<br />\nblast watching trick horseriding, bears playing hockey,<br />\nand two clowns jabbering their<br />\nroutines in a foreign language.<br />\nWe went to see many museums,<br />\nthe Hermitage and Russian<br />\nMuseum in Leningrad in particular, which were very good.<br />\nIt's hard to say what the best<br />\npart of the trip was. I think that<br />\nfor a lot of people spending<br />\ntime with a fun group in a completely alien place was the most<br />\nfun.

For some time, there<br />\nwas a question as to whether it<br />\nwould ever get to see the light<br />\nof day in this country, at least<br />\nin its current form.<br />\nBrazil was financed by Arnon Milchan, and set to be<br />\ndistributed in the United States<br />\nby Universal Pictures; but when<br />\nGilliam presented Universal<br />\nwith his finished product, they<br />\ndid not like what they saw. Sid<br />\nSheinberg of Universal insisted<br />\nthat the film should be reedited,<br />\nbut Gilliam held firm to his<br />\nown vision of the movie. When<br />\na stalemate was reached, Universal put Brazil on the shelf.<br />\nGilliam, annoyed with the idea<br />\nof his film not being released in<br />\nthe U.S., actually contemplated<br />\nsponsoring viewings of Brazil in<br />\nMexico to be attended by audiences bussed in from<br />\nCalifornia.<br />\nSuch drastic measures would<br />\nnot be needed. A special screening of Brazil was arranged in<br />\nthis country for Los Angeles<br />\ncritics, who left so enthusiastic<br />\nabout the work that they voted<br />\nit the best film of 1985. Universal's desire to reedit was obviously eclipsed by their visions<br />\nof dollar signs and added<br /><br />\nprestige, so they scrambled to<br />\nhave the film released in New<br />\nYork and around the country in<br />\ntime to have it qualify for the<br />\nAcademy Awards. It is now up<br />\nfor the Best Original Screenplay<br />\nand Best Art Direction Oscars;<br />\nsuch awards would be welldeserved indeed.<br />\nFor those who are familiar<br />\nwith Terry Gilliam's name but<br />\nare unable to place it, he is<br />\nprimarily known for being one<br />\nsixth of Monty Python,<br />\nalthough he is certainly a filmmaker in his own right, with<br />\nsuch films as Monty Python<br />\nand the Holy Grail(co-directed<br />\nwith Terry Jones), Jabberwocky, and Time Bandits to his<br />\ncredit. The only Python of<br />\nAmerican origin, Gilliam does<br />\nnot appear in many of the<br />\ngroup's sketches but he does<br />\nkeep his on-screen presence felt<br />\nby being the man behind the<br />\nMonty Python animation (see<br />\nthe opening credit sequence of<br />\n\"Life of Brian\" for what may<br />\nbe his most notable exercise in<br />\nanimation to date).<br />\nAs could be expected from<br />\nsuch a clever, colorful<br />\nanimator, Gilliam presents us<br />\nwith some terrifically stunning<br />\nvisuals in what can be termed<br />\nhis personal version of \"1984.\"<br />\nThe film<br />\ntakes<br />\nplace<br />\n\"Sometime in the 20th century;\" the scene is a<br />\nnightmarish \"future world\" of<br /><br />\nsorts, but it is a future where<br />\nstyles and technology were not<br />\nallowed to progress past the<br />\nforties and fifties. Mind control<br />\nis the way of life, and posters<br />\nseen throughout the film<br />\ndisplay the philosophy of the<br />\nall-dominating Ministry of Information: \"Suspicion Breeds<br />\nConfidence,\" \"Don't Suspect a<br />\nFriend\u2014Report Him,\"_ and the<br />\nlike. Computers, old-time<br />\ntelevision, and endless paperwork characterize life in this<br />\nunnamed metropolis where<br />\never-present and unsightly<br />\nducts must have some greater<br />\npurpose than the mere transfer<br />\nof hot air.<br />\nThe screenplay, written by<br />\nGilliam, Charles McKeown,<br />\nand playwright Tom Stoppard<br />\n(Rosencrantz and Gildenstern<br />\nare Dead, and more recently,<br />\nThe Real Thing) details the life<br />\nof Sam Lowrie (Jonathan<br />\nPryce), a worker in the<br />\nMinistry's<br />\nInformation<br />\nRetrieval department who is<br />\nsatisfied with being no more<br />\nthan a number in society. The<br />\nfreedom he lacks he makes up<br />\nfor in his dreams, where he envisions himself a winged warior continually coming to the<br />\nfescue of a most heavenly fair<br />\nmaiden.<br />\nRobert DeNiro has the<br />\nsmaller role of Archibald Tuttle, a heating engineer sick of<br />\nthe system. No longer willing to<br /><br />\ndeal with the limitless Central<br />\nServices paperwork, Tuttle<br />\nbecomes a renegade repairman,<br />\nproviding much-needed work<br />\non people's broken air conditioning without first receiving<br />\nproper clearance from the<br />\nauthorities. As a result, Tuttle<br />\nis seen as a subversive who must<br />\nbe eliminated, but he always<br />\nmanages to stay one step ahead<br />\nof the law. When the computer<br />\nprints out the instructions for<br />\nTuttle's arrest, a bug in the<br />\nprinter (literally) causes his<br />\nname to be printed as \"Buttle\"<br />\ninstead, resulting in the termination of Archibald Buttle,<br />\na poor but devoted husband<br />\nand family man.<br />\nJill Leyton (Kim Greist), a<br />\npolitically radical truck-driving<br />\nneighbor of the Buttles, wants<br />\nto correct this obvious miscarriage of \"justice\" before it is<br />\ntoo late. Her efforts bring her<br />\nto the Ministry of Information,<br />\nwhere she is spotted by Sam<br />\nLowrie, who realizes that<br />\nLeyton just so happens to be a<br />\nshort-haired version of the<br />\nwoman of his dreams. The normally unambitious Lowrie accepts a promotion arranged by<br />\nhis affluent mother (Katherine<br />\nHelmond, and, yes, those are<br />\nshoes that she wears on her<br />\nhead) only so that he can gain<br />\naccess to classified information<br />\nabout his mystery woman. But<br />\nwhen Lowrie becomes obsessed<br /><br />\nin his search for the woman he<br />\nloves, he is pegged as being a<br />\nradical himself.<br />\nGilliam has done some<br />\nfascinating, even stunning<br />\nthings with the visuals<br />\nthroughout the film. I,owrie's<br />\ndream sequences are highlights,<br />\nand things reach a stunning<br />\npeak at the film's end, in an<br />\nodd sequence that flows<br />\nsmoothly and beautifully from<br />\none scene to the next. The sheer<br />\nbizarreness of much of the film,<br />\nboth in storyline and imagery,<br />\nbetrays the existence of a<br />\nPython in the director's chair.<br />\nBut while the film is hardly<br />\nwithout humor, it is also not<br />\ncomedy through and through,<br />\nand, without spoiling anything,<br />\nit does not end in the way you<br />\nmight hope it would.<br />\nBrazil is a fine film on many<br />\nlevels, and is far from being for<br />\nMonty Python fans alone. In<br />\nfact, expecting a Monty Python<br />\ncomedy will only leave you<br />\ndisappointed. Says Gilliam,<br />\nBrazil is \"About the impossibility of escaping from<br />\nreality,\" and that's not exactly<br />\na knee-slapper of a topic. But<br />\nBrazil is worth seeing, and<br />\ndeserves to be seen all the same.<br />\nAfter all, it must be a highquality, intelligent feature; if it<br />\nwasn't, why would Universal<br />\ntry to stop its release?<br /><br />\nDazzling 42nd Street in 4-week run at Mechanic<br />\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\nDepending on your point of<br />\nview, spectacle is hard to come<br />\nby these days or it is overwhelming in its abundance. TV,<br />\nwith its constantly growing<br />\nvolume, beat, and flourescent<br />\ncolor provides an endless supply of spectacle; on the other<br />\nhand, there seems to be a lot<br />\nless around to be truly awed<br />\nby\u2014less that makes you sit<br />\nback and go, \"wow . ..\"42nd<br />\nStreet is pure spectacle, of the<br />\nsort that's been missing lately.<br />\nApparently, this show (and<br />\nthis is definitely a show, not a<br />\nplay) has broken all kinds of<br />\nrecords at the Mechanic<br />\nTheatre Box Office and it's<br />\neasy to see why\u2014it's really a<br />\nwonderful thing to watch and<br />\nlisten to. Those who came<br />\nopening night expecting dazzling original dance numbers<br />\ncould not have been disappointed; those who expected<br />\neven a semblance of an intelligent plot had to have<br />\nbeen\u2014but that's not the point.<br />\nTo this kind of show, a plot is<br />\nsimply supplementary.<br />\nWhat plot does exist concerns producer Julian Marsh<br />\n(played by showbiz veteran<br />\nBarry Nelson\u2014a ringer for a<br />\ntall Earl Weaver)and his efforts<br />\nto put on a show during the<br />\nDepression. Gail Benedict plays<br />\nPeggy Sawyer, the inevitable<br />\nsmall town girl who comes<br />\nfrom nowhere to save the show<br /><br />\nand Tony award-winner<br />\nDolores Gray plays Dorothy<br />\nBrock, a spoiled showbiz<br />\nlegend. The show's weakest<br />\nlinks probably lie in its casting<br />\nas both Nelson and Gray seem<br />\nfar too old for their roles. For<br />\nexample, there is a hint of a<br />\nromantic relationship between<br />\nJulian and Peggy which tends<br />\nto make one cringe as Nelson is<br />\ntwice as old as Gail Benedict.<br />\nAlso, when Peggy takes over<br />\nthe leading role from Dorothy,<br />\nshe fits perfectly into her<br />\ncostumes\u2014even<br />\nthough<br />\nDolores Gray is shaped like<br />\nEthel Merman and Benedict<br />\ncertainly isn't. But then again,<br />\nas Broadway continues to<br />\ndecline, I imagine it is inevitable<br />\nthat the real \"name\" stars are<br />\ngoing to come from farther and<br />\nfarther in the past. In reality,<br />\nhowever, Gail Benedict makes<br />\na far greater impression than<br />\neither Nelson or Gray, the two<br />\n\"names\", playing Peggy with<br />\nthe exact amount of exaggerated spunk required of the<br />\nrole\u2014and there is certainly no<br />\ndoubt that she can sing and<br />\ndance, and sing and dance well.<br />\nNevertheless, 42nd Street is<br />\nmost impressive for its ensemble dancing than for its individual performances. In a<br />\nway, the set pieces and musical<br />\nnumbers are the real stars of the<br />\nshow. The dance numbers start<br />\nout with a bang\u2014the colorful<br />\n\"Audition\"\u2014and build in<br />\nspectacularity until the<br />\nfinale\u2014\"42nd Street,\" a<br /><br />\nmassive number with the lights<br />\nof Braodway as a backdrop. In<br />\nbetween these two numbers, the<br />\nmusical pieces range from the<br />\nclever \"Shadow Waltz,\"<br />\nfeaturing dancing silhouettes;<br />\nto the flashy \"Dames,\" featuring mirrors and sequins; to the<br />\nracy \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo,\"<br />\nfeaturing a newly-wed couple<br />\nand a host of lingerie-clad<br />\n\"dancers.\" Much of the music<br />\n(written by the team of Warren<br />\nand Dubin) is familiar\u2014<br />\n\"We're in the Money,\"<br />\n\"Lullaby of Broadway,\" and<br />\nof course \"42nd Street,\" but<br />\nmost of it isn't familiar, which<br />\nis nice in many respects.<br />\nIf there is a problem with this<br />\nproduction, it lies in the way the<br />\nobviously inferior plot interferes with the musical<br />\nqualities. Unlike .the standard<br />\nmusical, the first act doesn't<br />\nend with a bang but on a down<br />\nnote. In the same way, the show<br />\ndoesn't really end with the<br />\nfinale but on a melancholy, sentimental reprise of \"42nd<br />\nStreet\" sung by Julian Marsh.<br />\nThe writers evidentally were<br />\ntrying to avoid the show<br />\nbusiness cliches but let's face it,<br />\na musical is hardly fine art and<br />\npure crowd pleasing is certainly no sin.<br />\nBut on the whole, the show<br />\nis great. Besides the good performances of Barry Nelson and<br />\nDolores Gray, and especially<br />\nGail Benedict, one is treated to<br />\nthe comic talents of Denise Lor<br />\nand Don Potter. as the in-<br /><br />\nPress Photo<br /><br />\nBarry Nelson as producer 'Julian Marsh.' All you trivia buffs know him<br />\nas the first James Bond.

Wu<br /><br />\nAutobiography seems to get<br />\naway with much more than<br />\nmost literary forms. Few people are not amenable to a little<br />\nphilosophizing and only impatient readers insist on fast action and stylish wordplay. But<br />\nat the same time, life stories of<br />\nthe rich and famous are hardly<br />\nboring. So in our time, we have<br />\nslick, heavily-marketed accounts of successes by<br />\nhousehold names like Ferraro<br />\nand Iacocca topping the bestseller lists. Then, without any<br />\nghost author credit in small<br />\nprint, along comes Entrances,<br />\nAn American Director's<br />\nJourney by the late Alan<br />\nSchneider. Mr. Schneider was<br />\none of America's formeost<br />\ntheatre directors, having done<br />\nWho's Afraid of Virginia<br />\nWoolf? among other major<br />\nplays. Entrances was to be only the first volume of his<br />\nautobiography, delivered to<br />\nViking Penguin a scant nine<br />\ndays before his death.<br />\nThis book narrates an entirely different sort of success, with<br />\nvivid little scenes. The language<br />\nisn't fussy, but neither does it<br />\nread as an oral history might.<br />\nIt has a quality of being<br />\nmoderate, balanced between a<br />\nrich ornate style and a lean<br />\nsparse style. This complements<br />\nthe content well. Mr. Schneider<br />\nis aware he is telling us a story,<br />\nin his case a true personal story,<br />\nand he is unhampered by the<br /><br />\nwriting itself.<br />\nMr. Schneider's childhood<br />\nwas filled with unhappy incidents, presented here without<br />\nmelodrama, almost too easy to<br />\nread. There is a natural quality<br />\nof having gotten over trauma.<br />\nA recurring early memory is of<br />\nhis mother struggling to get<br />\ncod-liver oil for the young<br />\nAlan,<br />\nthen<br />\nAbram<br />\nLeopoldovitch Schneider, son<br />\nof two young doctors struggling in Revolutionary Russia.<br />\nBut the child was not appreciative of this important part<br />\nof his diet...After a perilous<br />\njourney through paperwork,<br />\nhis family emigrated to<br />\nAmerica. When the other<br />\nchildren were evil in the way<br />\nchildren are, making fun of his<br />\nbeing Jewish and actually attacking him, he recounts that<br />\nhe learned to run fast, \"a skill<br />\nthat later helped me as a track<br />\nman in high school and college.<br />\nNothing is without its compensations.\" This exemplifies the<br />\nrelative absence of emotion<br />\nthroughout the book.<br />\nLater, he lived in Baltimore<br />\nand spent a great deal of time<br />\nsurreptitiously reading science<br />\nfiction (then less respectable<br />\nthan pornography) and watching movies. He writes that he<br />\nmight have read a play or two,<br />\nbut at the time his \"contemporary theatre was on film.\"<br />\nThen he happened to be invited<br />\nto see a play. Immediately,<br />\nthere began an obsession.<br />\nMr. Schneider first attended<br />\nJohns Hopkins; his parents<br />\nbelieved he would follow them<br />\ninto medicine. Instead, he<br />\nstruggled with physics, decided<br />\nto become a journalist and then<br />\nthought to transfer to University of Michigan. He ended up<br /><br />\nat Wisconsin, where he tried<br />\nout for many plays and was<br />\nnever cast in a leading role. So<br />\nhe wound up directing and<br />\ndistinguishing himself for producing a dramatic adaptation<br />\nof a story without having the<br />\nlegal rights to do so.<br />\nAfter \"First Acts,\" Alan<br />\nenters the real world and the<br />\nbook becomes a detailed<br />\nmemoir of his struggling career.<br />\nHe writes about his not having<br />\nheld a regular job and then<br />\nusually receiving two offers at<br />\nonce. He seemed to always get<br />\ntwo proposals and of course,<br />\nthe job he did choose never<br />\nlasted long. The book describes<br />\nmany events, without being too<br />\nconcerned with a life<br />\nphilosophy or even a<br />\nphilosophy of directing.<br />\nUnfortunately, the later sections are also considerably less<br />\ninteresting to read then the<br />\nglimpses of childhood. There is<br />\nless humor, less personality and<br />\nonly the theatre. A few episodes<br />\nof life break up the lone introduction to the crazy world of<br />\nAmerican drama. He loses his<br />\nvirginity, gets married, has<br />\nchildren, suffers a few personal<br />\nlosses and the show goes on.<br />\nPerhaps because there are a<br />\nmultitude of characters, none<br />\nof the players in \"Second Acts\"<br />\nbecomes three-dimensional.<br />\nNot even his wife Eugenie<br />\nMuckle takes on any<br />\ndistinguishable persona. Action<br />\ntakes place, but little character<br />\ndevelopment does. For an<br />\nautobiography, this is acceptable if the author reveals some<br />\nof his thoughts. Alan Schneider<br />\ndoes only a fair job of depicting<br />\nhis inner thoughts. Odd, given<br />\nthat he favored acting<br />\nmotivated by internal action,<br /><br />\nrather than acting based upon<br />\nexternals.<br />\nHe reveals very little about<br />\nhis private life, only slightly<br />\nmore about the task of directing and a word or two about<br />\neach of the dozens of notable<br />\nactors and actresses he has<br />\nworked with. As this goes on,<br />\nthe parade of actors go by. Mr.<br />\nScneider takes care to always<br />\nmention that a particular<br />\nfavorite has previously worked<br />\nwith him in this play or that. If<br />\nhe did not append these notices<br />\nto the actors, even an attentive<br />\nreader would probably fail to<br />\ntake note of these facts, each<br />\nactor being reduced to two<br />\nthings, a real name and a stage<br />\nname.<br />\n\"Third Acts\" continues with<br />\nWaiting For Godot, a valiant<br />\neffort which was an immediate<br />\nfailure in a posh Miami<br />\nplayhouse not known for plays,<br />\nbut for its fancy restaurant.<br />\nThis production began Alan<br />\nSchneider's association with<br />\nserious drama in America. He<br />\nbecame the first choice as director for Beckett, Pinter and Edward Albee's work. The discussion of \"meaning\" in the work<br />\nof this trio is limited, with notes<br />\nhere and there and references to<br />\nthe immense quantity of communications between both<br />\ndirector and playwright used in<br />\nproducing the play. Perhaps<br />\nthose scraps of ideas would<br />\nhave made for a more revealing<br />\nanalysis of theatre.<br />\nNow and then there appears<br />\nan allusion to Mr. Schneider's<br />\nreputation for a quick and nasty<br />\ntemper,<br />\nbut<br />\nthe<br />\nautobiography is by this time<br />\nstriking for its lack of emotion.<br />\nEven the death of Mr.<br />\nSchneider's father does not carry<br /><br />\nthe full impact it should. This<br />\nis not a fault of the writing<br />\nstyle, but rather a result of the<br />\nbook's focus. This is a book<br />\nabout the theatre life of Alan<br />\nSchneider, not about the personal life of Alan Schneider.<br />\nEven so, his ideal of an<br />\nAmerican theatre is not explored, there is only a cursory<br />\ndiscussion of theatre criticism<br />\nand the book is limited to the<br />\nimmediate vicinity of the stag:.<br />\nThis constraint is brokea,<br />\nthough only occasionally.<br />\nSamuel Beckett comes alive and<br />\nthere is a Buster Keaton, still<br />\nliving in 1927. Despite the<br />\nlimited range of what Alan<br />\nSchneider is willing to reveal,<br />\nthe writing always sustains the<br />\nmaterial, so the book is not dry<br />\nreading. This volume ends in<br />\nthe late 1960s, with Alan finally established at the age of<br />\nforty-nine, directing his greatest<br />\ncommercial success, a set of one<br />\nacts by Robert Anderson.<br />\nWhen the American public<br />\nbothers to read, light reading is<br />\nthe<br />\nfirst<br />\nchoice.<br />\nAn<br />\nautobiography of this sort<br />\nwould need to be superlative to<br />\nattract attention. For the reader<br />\nwith catholic tastes, there are<br />\nfar too many good books for<br />\neven a book reviewer to finish<br />\nin a lifetime. There are even a<br />\nfair number of well-written<br />\nbiographies brought out every<br />\nyear. Entrances is a welcome<br />\nbreak from the glossy celebrity<br />\ndiary, starting off with an interesting childhood but managing only a partially satisfactory<br />\n388 pages. For almost the cost<br />\nof a show, this genuine<br />\nautobiography is recommended<br />\nto those who are attracted to its<br />\nsubtitle, An American Director's Journey.<br /><br />\nGreeley's Religion That Turns The Pages<br />\nAngels of September.<br />\nby Andrew M. Greeley<br />\na Bernard Geis Associates book<br />\n$17.95, 451 pages<br />\nby Howell Sasser<br />\nWhatever happened to the<br />\ngood old days?

One can only imagine<br />\nthat Church attendance was<br />\npretty good.<br />\nOf course, today we know<br />\nbetter. It can be scientifically<br />\nproven that: God is dead, the<br />\ndevil was a hoax played on<br />\nstupid peasants, and that Sunday morning is the best time to<br />\nget space on the tennis courts.<br />\nThe vacuum left in our ability<br />\nto deal with everyday traumas<br />\nby the absence of the Church<br />\ncan be adequately filled with a<br />\npsychiatrist (worshipping at the<br />\naltar of psychoanalysis).<br /><br />\nBut what of those who live in<br />\nboth worlds? That is, those<br />\nwho continue to accept the<br />\nRoman Catholic teaching on<br />\nthe existence of God and of sin;<br />\nand at the same time function<br />\nin the real world, complete with<br />\nanalyst and a \"modern\" and<br />\ntherefore in the Church's eyes,<br />\nsometimes \"sinful\" lifestyle.<br />\nWhat might happen if a<br />\nmodern person chose (unconsciously) to interpret the<br />\nevents of what by modern standards would be a normal life<br />\nthrough the eyes of her not<br />\nwholly modern Church? Could<br />\nthere be demons in the world of<br />\nhigh technology? These are the<br />\nquestions addressed in Father<br />\nAndrew Greeley's latest novel,<br />\nThe Angels of September.<br />\nThe modern person already<br />\nmentioned is a woman in early<br />\nmiddle age named Anne Reilly;<br />\nbut perhaps it was stretching<br />\nthe truth a little to call her life<br />\nnormal. She has been married<br />\nand divorced twice and has had<br />\nan affair which would have led<br />\nto a third marriage, had the<br />\nChurch not forbidden it, and<br /><br />\nhad she not obeyed. Indeed, the<br />\nChurch has appeared at some<br />\ncrucial point in each of her relationships, and has each time<br />\nacted against her in a way<br />\nwhich would have left others<br />\nwithout faith. She is made to<br />\nfeel personally guilty and<br />\nresponsible for each failure, a<br />\ntrait which she already displays<br />\nin her feelings toward her<br />\nchildren.<br />\nHer greatest manifestation of<br />\nguilt feelings is, however, not<br />\nrelated to any experience in her<br />\nadult life. It is, rather, her fear<br />\nthat she was responsible for a<br />\nfire in her elementary school<br />\nwhich killed seventy of her<br />\nclassmates. Wrapped up in her<br />\nrecollections of this event is the<br />\nparish priest, Desmond Kenny.<br />\nHe continues to reappear<br />\nthroughout the novel, and is in<br />\nfact the impetus for all the action of the book. Everything<br />\ncenters around an exhibition of<br />\nartworks by Kenny being put<br />\non in Anne Reilly's gallery.<br />\nGreeley lets on that Father Kenny went insane at some point in<br />\nhis career, and this is said to ex-<br /><br />\nplain any oddities in his art.<br />\nHowever, strange events begin<br />\nto take place. Fires break out \"...she was responsithat only Anne can see. The<br />\nble for a fire in her<br />\ntelephone rings and only Anne<br />\ncan hear it. Worst of all, the elementary school<br />\nscene in one of the more which killed seventy<br />\ngraphically violent paintings,<br />\ncalled \"Divine Justice,\" seems of her classmates.\"<br />\nto be moving to Anne. As if this<br />\nweren't enough, an explosion in<br />\nthe gallery brings police inspec- mouthpiece of Andrew<br />\ntor Michael Casey into Anne's Greeley, preacher, the message<br />\nlife, or more exactly back into usually doesn't stomp off the<br />\nit. Anne and Mike have had page and slap the reader silly (a<br />\nwhat Greeley calls a \"psychic familiar event with some of the<br />\nromance\" ever since they fell other \"theme novelists\").<br />\nAs in past novels, he occainto a snow bank together in<br />\nsionally goes out on a<br />\nthe seventh grade.<br />\nIf all this seems hard to theological limb, such as when<br />\nfollow, it is only because lack he takes his customary jabs at<br />\nof space and a respect of John Cardinal Cody. But, in<br />\nsuspense prevent me putting in the end, orthodox Catholic<br />\nall the salient story lines, thought wins out. All the<br />\nGreeley has no such restric- \"good\" characters remain in<br />\ntions, and uses ample space to the Church, faith intact.<br />\nrecord every minute detail. He Religion nonwithstanding,<br />\nuses various narrative devices Angels is still a good book of<br />\nwith great success, and the sort that make you stay up<br />\nmanages to make his chracters until odd hours to read just one<br />\nthree dimensional enough that more chapter.

Maalin's rash began on October 26,<br />\n1977 in Merka Town, Somalia.<br /><br />\nthe doctors at a hospital Dr.<br />\nHenderson visited said that they<br />\nhad too many patients to have<br />\ntime to vaccinate. Ironically,<br />\nDr. Henderson did an experiment there that verified that it<br />\nonly takes about 15 seconds to<br />\nvaccinate someone.<br />\nPart of the problem was<br />\ncaused by the fact that the industrialized countries had forced<br />\ntheir pattern of health care on<br />\nan area where it was totally inappropriate. Dr. Henderson<br />\ncited a beautiful hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia that has<br />\nover 500 beds and all the latest<br />\nmedical equipment, but lacks<br />\nsufficient staff and is within<br />\nthree days travel for only 3 percent of the country's population. The same problem occurred in Monrovia, Liberia.<br />\nThere, the Swiss ended up staffing the hospital..<br />\nThis was the situation that<br />\nfaced Dr. Henderson in 1967<br />\nwhen, as a member of WHO,<br />\nhe decided to eliminate the<br />\nsmallpox virus once and for all.<br />\nHis attack was two-pronged: to<br />\nvaccinate 80 percent of the<br />\npopulation with lab-tested vaccine, and to contain any outbreaks of the disease.<br />\nThe main stumbling block<br />\nfor the immunization program<br /><br />\nwas the general lack of interest<br />\nand motivation. As Dr.<br />\nHenderson said, \"If a child has<br />\na broken leg, it is not unusual<br />\nfor his mother to carry him 10<br />\nor 20 miles to a doctor, but we<br />\nwere lucky to get 50 percent of<br />\nthe people within a mile [come<br />\nto be vaccinated].\" Also, as in<br />\nthe case of the hospital in Iran,<br />\ncaring for the sick people left<br />\nno time for the seemingly less<br />\nurgent task of immunization.<br />\nTo get around this problem,<br />\nteams were sent out to each<br />\nvillage in the afflicted countries<br />\nand told to go door-to-door if<br />\nnecessary to achieve their<br />\nquota. Then, an investigative<br />\nteam was sent to do a random<br />\nsampling of 10 percent solely to<br />\ndetermine if 80 percent of the<br />\nvillagers had received their vaccinations. Almost immediately,<br />\nareas which had been sending<br />\nback very low results because<br />\n\"the women are in purdah and<br />\nwill not allow male vaccinators<br />\nto touch them or their<br />\nchildren\" suddenly began<br />\nreporting results of nearly 90<br />\npercent.<br />\nSurprisingly enough, the<br />\ncampaign actually required very<br />\nlittle money and manpower.<br />\nThe total operating cost was 8<br />\nmillion dollars a year, corn-<br /><br />\nNew AIDS Unit Opens at Hopkins<br />\nThe inpatient staff consists<br />\nof, for the most part, those who<br />\nOn February 4th of this year, volunteer to help these patients<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Medical In- and of those whose research institutions opened its inpatient terests are related to this<br />\nAIDS program.

In the whole campaign, only one employee was<br />\nlost, and that was due to a car<br />\naccident. In response to a question, Dr. Henderson said that<br />\nhis staff was able to be so effective because, although they<br />\nwere given strong support, they<br />\nwere given a flexible set of<br />\nguidelines rather than a<br />\n\"recipe.\" Each group had to<br />\ndevelop a strategy that was<br />\nspecifically tailored for the<br />\ncountry they were in.<br />\nIn commemoration of its fortieth anniversary, the UN has<br />\nagain made a commitment to<br />\n\"the world and all its peoples.\"<br />\nIn a little-noted declaration in<br />\n1985, the UN stated that<br />\n[through WHO]it will provide<br />\nfor universal child immunization and the elimination of<br />\nthe Western'<br />\npolio in<br />\nHemisphere by 1990.<br />\nJoining the general trend<br />\ntoward more preventive<br />\nmedicine, in January of '85,<br />\nJohns Hopkins expanded its<br />\nresearch faculty in this area to<br />\nover 65 scientists, two to three<br />\ntimes that of any other institution in the world.

They were,<br />\nyou recall, our last three Olympic basketball coaches, though<br />\nGavitt had to take a rain check<br />\nbecause President Carter<br />\nthought by not going to<br />\nMoscow for the 1980 Games<br />\nthat the Russian bear would<br />\nrelease his hug on Afghanistan.<br />\nFrom the top, let's realize<br />\nthat if the Eastern Bloc nations<br />\nhad been present at LaLa Land<br />\nlast year, we would have only<br />\nreceived about 65 percent of the<br />\ngold that we did. Look to South<br />\nKorea to be the first true Olympics in 12 years since Dean<br />\nSmith brought back the basketball trophy from Montreal in<br />\n'76.<br />\nNow, as to the selection of<br />\nthe coach.<br />\nThe selection process is a<br />\nsimple one. The Olympic<br />\nBasketball Committee, which is<br />\nmade up of 16 people, recommends seven or eight candidates<br />\nto the United States Olympic<br />\nCommittee, which makes the<br />\nfinal selection.<br />\nHere are things the Committee must keep in mind, when it<br />\nmakes up its list:<br />\nFirst, the coach obviously<br />\nhas to be a Division I coach<br />\nbecause he has to be visible, to<br />\ncommand the respect of the<br />\nfuture NBA millionaires temporarily under his command.<br />\nAnd, he has to be Caesar's<br />\nwife, above suspicion. There<br />\ncan be no investigation and no<br />\npossible probation lurking over<br />\nhis shoulder from the NCAA.<br />\nFinally, the committee<br />\nshould remember that one of<br />\nthe biggest assets American<br />\nplayers have over players from<br />\nthe rest of the world is defense.<br />\nSo their choice should be a<br />\ncoach who is defensiveoriented, who is known for his<br />\nability to teach good team<br />\ndefense.<br />\nThe point is: No matter who<br /><br />\nIcemen Fight Tooth And Nils<br />\nby Andy Gray<br /><br />\nHOPKINS TANNING<br />\nSALE: ONE YEAR UNLIMITED'<br />\nMEMBERSHIP<br />\nONLY $200.00<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\nTAN NOW<br />\nLocated at the Hopkins House<br />\n110W. 39th Si.<br />\n10 Sessions $30.00<br />\n1 month unlimited $40.00<br />\nCal for detath 089-4163<br />\nOn, Free Session with Purchase<br /><br />\narea's finest<br /><br />\nHaircutting<br />\n3333n. charles<br /><br />\nniffierro.

Because whoever the<br />\ncoach is, he must have this twoyear period to go through the<br />\nprocedure of selecting the team,<br />\nand picking his assistants for<br />\ntheir ability, not from the good<br />\nol' boy system.<br />\nMost importantly, our Olympic coach must have time to<br />\nfamiliarize the players with international play during the next<br />\ntwo summers. He must be able<br />\nto pick a couple of trial teams<br />\nto be sent out in the summer of<br />\n'87, so the players can learn the<br />\nins and outs of international<br />\nplay, and become aware of<br />\nwhat happens when you're not<br />\nplaying on your own block, like<br />\nwe did in '84.<br />\nOne major problem that the<br />\nround ball fan is not aware of<br />\nis that the 1988 Games are being played from Sept. 17 to<br />\nOct. 2. How are we going to get<br />\nthe NBA to allow first round<br />\ndraft choices, a la Danny Manning, to play on the Olympic<br />\nteam when their NBA schedule<br />\nis starting up? And how are the<br />\nuniversities going to allow<br />\nballplayers to go into training<br />\nand miss the first 11<br />\n/<br />\n2 months of<br />\nschooling?<br />\nDon't get me wrong. These<br />\nproblems can be solved. But it's<br />\ntime to get the machinery in<br />\nprocess. Picking the coach is<br />\nthe first step.

Well, here's<br />\na new kind of puzzle for you. Each of the sentences or phrases is<br />\na clue to one word. The clues often, though net always, involve<br />\nanagrams or puns. The two words for row one have 15 letters between them (i.e., they go all the way across the puzzle), but you don't<br />\nknow where la stops and lb starts(word a always preceeds word b).<br />\nSo all you have to do is fill in all 20 worth (two in each row)correctly. As an added hint, the first letter of all the words, taken in order<br />\n(la through 10b), spells out a phrase. Whether you get the phrase<br />\nor not won't count\u2014it will merely help you to get the first letter of<br />\neach word. One more thing\u2014iii of the words have something to do<br />\nwith good 'ol JHU,so this will test not only your word-game ability,<br />\nbut also your knowledge of Hopkins trivia. Got all that? Good. Now<br />\njust get your answers to the Gatehouse by 5 p.m. Wednesday, and<br />\nyou could walk away with the beet<br /><br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br /><br />\nCongrats to Ron DeMatteo, winner of last week's Gala Word Quiz.<br />\nBelieve it or not, Ron tallied 789 words.(His letters: L, 1, 0, D, A,<br />\nR, N, T, S, E.)
