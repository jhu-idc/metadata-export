But<br />\nthe stars on a team are necessarily<br />\nlimited and it is in this regard that<br />\nthe sport, track, may function as a<br />\nteam.

It is precisely this notion which this letter proposes to<br />\nclarify.<br />\nTo the knowledge of the author,<br />\ntrack is a sport which stands apart<br />\nfrom most sports, not so much as an<br />\noutstanding sport but rather for its<br />\nexception in function. It is not a<br />\nsport where each member of the team<br />\nis dependent upon one another as a<br />\ngroup\u2014the dependence is upon the<br />\ntrack man as an individual performer. He cannot have an off-day as easily as a member of a cooperative<br />\nteam and let his teammates carry<br />\nthe brunt of the burden.<br />\nThis, no doubt, is the reason for<br />\nfindging so many stars in track. But<br />\nthe stars on a team are necessarily<br />\nlimited and it is in this regard that<br />\nthe sport, track, may function as a<br />\nteam. Usually it takes more than just<br />\nthe stars to win a meet. It takes the<br />\nsecond and third place men to add<br />\ntheir bit to the score.<br />\nTime and again it has been emphasized by coaches that in track there<br />\nis always room for the fellow with the<br />\n\"guts\" to stick.
