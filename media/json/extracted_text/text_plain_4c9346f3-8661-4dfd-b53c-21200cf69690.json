Bryllion<br />\nFagin, retired professor of drama<br />\nand English at this university.<br />\nchose for his topic, \"Eugene<br />\nO'Neill and his Critics.\" As with<br />\nhis forthcoming book on this<br />\ntopic, Dr. Fagin's lecture concerned itself with the career of<br />\nNew London, Connecticut born<br />\nplaywright Eugene O'Neill, and<br />\nhis critics.<br />\nIn his opening remarks, Dr.<br />\nFagin acknowledged the fact<br />\nthat he was dealing with a very<br />\ncontroversial figure in the person of O'Neill. Eugene O'Neill's<br />\nplays have been reviewed and<br />\ncriticized in many parts of the<br />\nworld. They have been performed<br />\nin Germany, Japan and Sweden.<br />\nPlaygoers in the latter country<br />\nhave been particularly receptive<br />\nto the works of O'Neill.

Although O'Neill<br />\nhad attended the best schools<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting last Monday night in the dormitory<br />\nrecreation room, the scene may have been 'set for a great<br />\nrevelation in dormitory living. The newly selected faculty<br />\nadvisors met with the Dean and the DSRC to discuss<br />\ndormitory problems. And there were many. However,<br />\nsomething may be done this time. With progressive<br />\nleadership from the new DSRC,constructive guidance from<br />\nthe new advisors, and cooperation from the Dean, the<br />\nAlumni Memorial Residences may just come close tv<br />\nbecoming that \"home away from home\" that we read<br />\nabout so much in the collegiate catalogs.<br />\nPlans have been proposed to renovate the lounges, dim<br />\nthe noise, help the freshman adjust to the difficult problem of dormitory living. But, the most important aim of<br />\nthe men present, and the one* most discussed, and the one<br />\nmost paramount, is the development of house unity and<br />\nspirit, the development of autonomous houses which can<br />\nfunction alone, replete with self-government.<br />\nThe fact is that the dormitories have grown too large<br />\nto be governed effectively by just one body of sixteen men.<br />\nAn attempt was made to extend this government with the<br />\naddition of floor representatives. However, this plan can<br />\nnever accomplish so great a task as that set before it.<br />\nEach house must organize within itself.

While<br />\nin a New London, Connecticut,<br />\nsaniforium, he had plenty of<br />\ntime to think. He translated his<br />\nthoughts into several small oneact playlets about the sea. Upon<br />\nhis release, O'Neill took several<br />\nof his manuscripts to a little<br />\ntheatre group, \"The Provincetown Players.\" This group produced these playlets with great<br />\nsuccess. Eventually, \"Provincetown Players\" presented O'Neill's<br />\nfirst full-length play, Beyond<br />\nthe Horizon, on Broadway in<br />\n1921. This play received rave reviews and was followed in succeeding years by The Emperor<br />\nJones and The Hairy Ape.<br />\nO'Neill discarded proven playwrighting formulae and adopted<br />\nnew styles over the years (including one, two, and even nineact plays.)<br />\nVarious Criticism<br />\nModern critics of O'Neill range<br />\nfrom those who .proclaim, \"He<br />\ncan't write!\", to those who accuse him of having \". . . no<br />\nmind!\" Dr. Fagin takes issue<br />\nwith these criticisms and finds<br />\nthem to be invalid.

It has<br />\nturned a deaf ear upon our written and verbal arguments<br />\nagainst membership, and thus, we feel, committed an open<br />\nflagrancy known in law circles as 'prior restraint': knowing that this column has often criticized the actions of<br />\nthe Council, and realizing that this column might be<br />\nhesitant to do so if it is included in Council membership,<br />\nthe Council enacted legislation countering our action prior<br />\nto the enactment of any such action.<br />\nA referendum is in the offing. Our arguments are<br />\nin the news story on page 1. We ask that the undergraduates vote wisely on that referendum.<br />\nWe trust that if we become a Student Council member<br />\nour successors, regardless of popular sentiment regarding<br />\nthe reasoning behind a blast, will continue to criticize the<br />\nCouncil if they feel justified to do so. However, we editors<br />\nwould not like to put them on the spot, and therefore ask<br />\nthat the referendum not be passed.<br />\nWhat will happen if our successors refuse to attend<br />\nmeetings?

These characters are first<br />\nseen by the audience at the time<br />\nin their lives when, as a result<br />\nof having encountered inscrutable forces, they have each<br />\nlearned something about themselves and their character.

The letters and my<br />\nreplies follow:<br />\nSIR:<br />\nMaybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years<br />\nago. On my very first day I got into a bridge game in the<br />\nstudent union. I am still in the same bridge game. I have never<br />\ngone to class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All I do<br />\nis play bridge.<br />\nTo explain my long absence and keep the money coining<br />\nfrom home, I told a harmless little lie; I said I was in medical<br />\nschool. This made Dad (my father) terribly proud. It also<br />\nenabled me to keep playing bridge. We were both very happy.<br />\nBut all good things must come to an end. Mine ended when<br />\nI came home for Christmas vacation. I arrived to find that<br />\nSister (my sister) was in the hospital with an ingrown spleen.<br />\nDr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was<br />\nscheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by<br />\na hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from Page 6)<br />\nthe life of the students in the<br />\ndormitories.<br />\nIn this time and in this country, in a city that has received<br />\npraise for its courage in simply<br />\nallowing children with two types<br />\nof skin pigmentation to attend<br />\nschool together, the fact remains<br />\nthat Hopkins is truly an island<br />\nof freedom and, equality in a<br />\nwide, tragic sea; and that we are<br />\nstill isolated, still sealed off from<br />\nthe people of this city.<br />\nJohn M. Brewer<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhen I first came to Hopkins<br />\nover three years ago I was'forced<br />\nby social pressure to learn an<br />\ninterminable card game called<br />\nPinochle. As if this weren't<br />\nenough, I now have been forced<br />\nto learn a new, equally interminable and even more frustrating game called bridge. I have<br />\nbeen forced to sit through hours<br />\nof .pure misery, enduring the<br />\nsilent scorn that only superior<br />\nbridge-players can bestow upon<br />\nthe neophyte.<br />\nHowever, the purpose behind<br />\nthis letter is not to complain of<br />\nthe lack of sympathy accorded<br />\nmy mistakes. I have noticed<br />\nthe sudden superabundance of<br />\nbridge games extending until<br />\nvery late in the evening or early<br />\nin the morning. When these<br />\ntake place in the Snack Bar,<br />\n<br />\nI have noticed that Mary is often<br />\nprevented from being able to<br />\nclose up as early as she would<br />\nlike. Then too, the noise and<br />\nrather foul language must greatly try her patience.<br />\nWhile it is too much to be<br />\nexpected that the bridge games<br />\nwill cease or at least be confined<br />\nto more reasonable hours of the<br />\nevening, I would like to suggest<br />\nthat the DSRC use some of the<br />\nvast amount of space available<br />\nin the basement to set up a card<br />\nroom. A few tables and solidlyconstructed chairs could be provided, good lighting installed,<br />\nand a deep pit sunk in the floor<br />\nfor cigarette butts, candy wrappers, and unsuccessful players<br />\nwho go down, doubled and vulnerable, on one bids.<br />\nI suggest this instead of the<br />\ndormitory lounges, which are<br />\npoorly lighted and cannot generally furnish a sufficiency of<br />\nchairs for the players.<br />\nI might add, also, that the<br />\nlate, late shift of cardsmen invariably manages to completely<br />\nlitter the area which they<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Barber Shop<br />\n\"for Hopkins Men\"<br />\n3233 St. Paul St., cor. 33rd St.<br />\nWhere all Blue Jays gather<br />\nMax flick, Owner<br />\n<br />\noccupy, to a radius of many feet,<br />\nand consequently force Mary to<br />\nstay later still in order to clean<br />\noff the tables again. This is<br />\nunkind to her and not at all<br />\nworthy of our so-called \"Hopkins<br />\nGentlemen.\"<br />\nEven in the absence of any<br />\nDSRC action, surely the players<br />\ncould have enough consideration<br />\nto continue their play elsewhere. If the situation does not<br />\nclear up soon, the custodians or<br />\nMary may have to institute a<br />\ncurfew in the Snack Bar. Probably what will transpire is that<br />\nthe bridge frenzy will gradually<br />\nsink back into tis primeval source<br />\nin the Hopkins' character, the<br />\n\"Goof-Off\" lobe, and peace will<br />\nonce again reign in Mary's soul<br />\nand the Snack Bar.<br />\nJos.

Bryllion<br />\nFagin, retired professor of drama<br />\nand English at this university.<br />\nchose for his topic, \"Eugene<br />\nO'Neill and his Critics.\" As with<br />\nhis forthcoming book on this<br />\ntopic, Dr. Fagin's lecture concerned itself with the career of<br />\nNew London, Connecticut born<br />\nplaywright Eugene O'Neill, and<br />\nhis critics.<br />\nIn his opening remarks, Dr.<br />\nFagin acknowledged the fact<br />\nthat he was dealing with a very<br />\ncontroversial figure in the person of O'Neill. Eugene O'Neill's<br />\nplays have been reviewed and<br />\ncriticized in many parts of the<br />\nworld. They have been performed<br />\nin Germany, Japan and Sweden.<br />\nPlaygoers in the latter country<br />\nhave been particularly receptive<br />\nto the works of O'Neill.

Although O'Neill<br />\nhad attended the best schools<br /><br />\nAt a meeting last Monday night in the dormitory<br />\nrecreation room, the scene may have been 'set for a great<br />\nrevelation in dormitory living. The newly selected faculty<br />\nadvisors met with the Dean and the DSRC to discuss<br />\ndormitory problems. And there were many. However,<br />\nsomething may be done this time. With progressive<br />\nleadership from the new DSRC,constructive guidance from<br />\nthe new advisors, and cooperation from the Dean, the<br />\nAlumni Memorial Residences may just come close tv<br />\nbecoming that \"home away from home\" that we read<br />\nabout so much in the collegiate catalogs.<br />\nPlans have been proposed to renovate the lounges, dim<br />\nthe noise, help the freshman adjust to the difficult problem of dormitory living. But, the most important aim of<br />\nthe men present, and the one* most discussed, and the one<br />\nmost paramount, is the development of house unity and<br />\nspirit, the development of autonomous houses which can<br />\nfunction alone, replete with self-government.<br />\nThe fact is that the dormitories have grown too large<br />\nto be governed effectively by just one body of sixteen men.<br />\nAn attempt was made to extend this government with the<br />\naddition of floor representatives. However, this plan can<br />\nnever accomplish so great a task as that set before it.<br />\nEach house must organize within itself. Each must<br />\nhave its own officers, its own athletic teams, its own individuality if one is expected to find a place where he can<br />\nidentify himself.<br />\nSeveral programs have already been enacted to conTo the Editors:<br />\ntribute to this house unity and identification or spirit of Two weeks ago, an undergradbelonging that most of us are looking for.

While<br />\nin a New London, Connecticut,<br />\nsaniforium, he had plenty of<br />\ntime to think. He translated his<br />\nthoughts into several small oneact playlets about the sea. Upon<br />\nhis release, O'Neill took several<br />\nof his manuscripts to a little<br />\ntheatre group, \"The Provincetown Players.\" This group produced these playlets with great<br />\nsuccess. Eventually, \"Provincetown Players\" presented O'Neill's<br />\nfirst full-length play, Beyond<br />\nthe Horizon, on Broadway in<br />\n1921. This play received rave reviews and was followed in succeeding years by The Emperor<br />\nJones and The Hairy Ape.<br />\nO'Neill discarded proven playwrighting formulae and adopted<br />\nnew styles over the years (including one, two, and even nineact plays.)<br />\nVarious Criticism<br />\nModern critics of O'Neill range<br />\nfrom those who .proclaim, \"He<br />\ncan't write!\", to those who accuse him of having \". . . no<br />\nmind!\" Dr. Fagin takes issue<br />\nwith these criticisms and finds<br />\nthem to be invalid.

It has<br />\nturned a deaf ear upon our written and verbal arguments<br />\nagainst membership, and thus, we feel, committed an open<br />\nflagrancy known in law circles as 'prior restraint': knowing that this column has often criticized the actions of<br />\nthe Council, and realizing that this column might be<br />\nhesitant to do so if it is included in Council membership,<br />\nthe Council enacted legislation countering our action prior<br />\nto the enactment of any such action.<br />\nA referendum is in the offing. Our arguments are<br />\nin the news story on page 1. We ask that the undergraduates vote wisely on that referendum.<br />\nWe trust that if we become a Student Council member<br />\nour successors, regardless of popular sentiment regarding<br />\nthe reasoning behind a blast, will continue to criticize the<br />\nCouncil if they feel justified to do so. However, we editors<br />\nwould not like to put them on the spot, and therefore ask<br />\nthat the referendum not be passed.<br />\nWhat will happen if our successors refuse to attend<br />\nmeetings?

Dr. Fagin also<br />\nfeels that many of O'Neill's<br />\ncritics resented the non-committal aspects of his nature. He was<br />\nneither a political nor a social<br />\nwriter. He was not a \"joiner.\"<br />\nHe gave no lectures and wrote<br />\nno reviews. Because he didn't<br />\nleave his critics anything to pindown or interpret, he only frustrated them and aroused their<br />\nire against him.<br />\nO'Neill's plays contain intensely sincere characters, people who<br />\nare vital and alive, people who<br />\ncan become a part of our own<br />\nlives. These characters are first<br />\nseen by the audience at the time<br />\nin their lives when, as a result<br />\nof having encountered inscrutable forces, they have each<br />\nlearned something about themselves and their character. Every<br />\ncharacter in an O'Neill play is<br />\ndestined to achieve self-enlightenment.<br />\nIt was with a touch of sadness that the overflow lecture<br />\ncrowd learned that Dr. Fagin<br />\nwould be leaving the Hopkins<br />\nfor a while at the end of this<br />\ncurrent academic year, to lecture<br />\nelsewhere in this country and<br />\nabroad.

On my very first day I got into a bridge game in the<br />\nstudent union. I am still in the same bridge game. I have never<br />\ngone to class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All I do<br />\nis play bridge.<br />\nTo explain my long absence and keep the money coining<br />\nfrom home, I told a harmless little lie; I said I was in medical<br />\nschool. This made Dad (my father) terribly proud. It also<br />\nenabled me to keep playing bridge. We were both very happy.<br />\nBut all good things must come to an end.

Brewer<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhen I first came to Hopkins<br />\nover three years ago I was'forced<br />\nby social pressure to learn an<br />\ninterminable card game called<br />\nPinochle. As if this weren't<br />\nenough, I now have been forced<br />\nto learn a new, equally interminable and even more frustrating game called bridge. I have<br />\nbeen forced to sit through hours<br />\nof .pure misery, enduring the<br />\nsilent scorn that only superior<br />\nbridge-players can bestow upon<br />\nthe neophyte.<br />\nHowever, the purpose behind<br />\nthis letter is not to complain of<br />\nthe lack of sympathy accorded<br />\nmy mistakes. I have noticed<br />\nthe sudden superabundance of<br />\nbridge games extending until<br />\nvery late in the evening or early<br />\nin the morning. When these<br />\ntake place in the Snack Bar,<br /><br />\nI have noticed that Mary is often<br />\nprevented from being able to<br />\nclose up as early as she would<br />\nlike. Then too, the noise and<br />\nrather foul language must greatly try her patience.<br />\nWhile it is too much to be<br />\nexpected that the bridge games<br />\nwill cease or at least be confined<br />\nto more reasonable hours of the<br />\nevening, I would like to suggest<br />\nthat the DSRC use some of the<br />\nvast amount of space available<br />\nin the basement to set up a card<br />\nroom. A few tables and solidlyconstructed chairs could be provided, good lighting installed,<br />\nand a deep pit sunk in the floor<br />\nfor cigarette butts, candy wrappers, and unsuccessful players<br />\nwho go down, doubled and vulnerable, on one bids.<br />\nI suggest this instead of the<br />\ndormitory lounges, which are<br />\npoorly lighted and cannot generally furnish a sufficiency of<br />\nchairs for the players.<br />\nI might add, also, that the<br />\nlate, late shift of cardsmen invariably manages to completely<br />\nlitter the area which they<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Barber Shop<br />\n\"for Hopkins Men\"<br />\n3233 St. Paul St., cor. 33rd St.<br />\nWhere all Blue Jays gather<br />\nMax flick, Owner<br /><br />\noccupy, to a radius of many feet,<br />\nand consequently force Mary to<br />\nstay later still in order to clean<br />\noff the tables again. This is<br />\nunkind to her and not at all<br />\nworthy of our so-called \"Hopkins<br />\nGentlemen.\"<br />\nEven in the absence of any<br />\nDSRC action, surely the players<br />\ncould have enough consideration<br />\nto continue their play elsewhere. If the situation does not<br />\nclear up soon, the custodians or<br />\nMary may have to institute a<br />\ncurfew in the Snack Bar.
