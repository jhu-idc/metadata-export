Quite the contrary! He has\u2014<br />\nprobably all his life, certainly through the<br />\nterm of his college and university existence\u2014<br />\nworked harder and revelled less than the most<br />\nof his companions. Even now he is mortifying his flesh for the good of his higher nature<br />\nby incessant studying, both night and day.<br />\nHow absurd, then, that anyone should project<br />\nthe leavening of his stern rectitude with a little more of human frailty, and call that\u2014his<br />\nsalvation. And yet he needs just this. He<br />\nmay have withstood the temptations of drinking, gambling, loafing, and all the rest. He<br />\nmust still be saved from himself; that is, from<br />\nthe conditions which at present surround him.<br />\nThe truth of this will become evident on a<br />\nlittle reflection. When a man enters upon<br />\nsome special graduate work, he finds that his<br />\ndepartment gives him much more of advantages than of time in which to avail himself<br />\nof them. These advantages have, perhaps,<br />\ncost him some sacrifice to obtain, while to enjoy them he has only this one opportunity.<br />\nSo he feels\u2014and justly\u2014the need of compressing all outside demands on his time into<br />\nthe smallest bounds possible, that he may<br />\ngive the utmost of it to his specialty.<br />\nBut though this cramming of his time is<br />\nnecessary, there is yet attendant on it a twofold danger. In the first place, his nervous<br />\nsystem is bound to suffer from the unremitting tax upon it; the importance of this point,<br />\nanyone who reads the article in Outing of Oc-<br />\n<br />\nNo<br />\n<br />\ntober 1st on Relaxation is sure to recognize.<br />\nAnd, in the second place, he is liable to undergo that of the sympathies, involved in pure<br />\nspecialization, and fatal to him if he intends<br />\nto take a place, and a worthy one, in life. For<br />\nhow can a teacher, for instance, get the best<br />\nresults from the men under him, unless he is<br />\nin actual comprehending sympathy with the<br />\nnature of each of them? And how can he be<br />\nin such sympathy, when he has renounced the<br />\nworld about him for a narrow double ego\u2014<br />\nhimself and his special line of study? I do<br />\nnot say that this has actually happened to<br />\nmany, or even any, of our graduates; but I<br />\nbelieve it to be a danger which threatens all.<br />\nTo counteract this dangerous tendency,<br />\nthere are at present no means at his hand.<br />\nNone, at least, within the University. He<br />\nmay go into society, should he possess or be<br />\nable to form an outside circle of friends.<br />\nShould he do so, it is bound to prove a serious<br />\ndistraction and handicap to his work. But<br />\nof the companionship most likely to be of<br />\nvalue to himself\u2014the men of other departments of his own University, whose life and<br />\npurposes lie along the same lines as his<br />\nown, yet who have, from the difference of<br />\ntheir work, a certain refreshing difference<br />\nof ideas\u2014of this he has none. He may<br />\nmeet them at boarding-house or fraternity;<br />\nhe may have known them before he came<br />\nhere. But as far as his university existence<br />\ngoes, there is no reason whatever why he<br />\nshould ever come to know them. There is,<br />\nindeed, a -Graduate Students' Association\"<br />\nwhose name would imply some commingling<br />\nof its members. But in the first place, only<br />\na small proportion of the graduates belong to<br />\nthe Association. And those who do need<br />\nnever see each other, except at the semi-occasional cake and lemonade functions\u2014mournful affairs, whose stiff conversation is not at<br />\nall calculated to compensate a man for giving<br />\n<br />\n\f'7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nup an evening's work, fighting his way into \"'howdy!\" \"how's the boy?\" \"come over here<br />\na dress suit and high collar, and then spend- and sit down by me; I want to talk to you;\"<br />\n\"oh, do you know so and so?

That a majority of the<br />\ngraduate students; when a man numbered men desire it to come to pass I know. Otheramong his best friends students and profes- wise I would have hardly ventured the exsors of other departments. These were the pression of such radical opinions. But whatdays when the old University Club\u2014a univer- ever may be done in the matter, let one effort<br />\nsity club in fact as well as name\u2014held its be made\u2014to break up this constant classifyweekly social meetings in rooms near the Uni- ing of men into the departments to which they<br />\nversity; where, moreover, a man could at all belong.

The general acceptance of<br />\nthe work done last year, the favorable appearance of the contestants in public debate, and<br />\nevident appreciation on the part of the men,<br />\nhas Sled to an increase of hours for the course<br />\nand a broadening of its scope. The instruction will be given, as last year, by Dr. Guy<br />\nCarleton Lee.<br />\nThe Senior and Junior classes will meet an<br />\nhour weekly, with the exception of the winter<br />\nterm, when the Seniors will meet every other<br />\nweek only. The Senior class, as formerly,<br />\nwill be organized as a Senate; the Juniors as<br />\na House of Representatives. This College<br />\nCongress, however, will convene only on alternate weeks; every second week will'be devoted to class instruction in Parliamentary<br />\nLaw and Practice, extemporaneous speaking<br />\nand debate. In the Senior class no text book<br />\nwill be employed other than a syllabus prepared by Dr. Lee. As a work of reference, \"Roberts's Parliamentary Syllabus\" and<br />\n\"Rules of Order\" will be used by the Junior<br />\nclass.<br />\nIn addition to the regular weekly meetings,<br />\nconferences will be arranged for the upper<br />\nclassmen, for the study of methods of collecting and sifting evidence, drawing briefs and<br />\npreparation for debate.<br />\nA happy innovation in the College Congress will be the arrangement in a related series of the subjects for debate. Each topic will<br />\nbe some phase of the great question of Territorial Expansion now so widely agitated. The<br />\nsubjects will be so planned that there will be<br />\nno interlocking of arguments, and the entire<br />\nseries will furnish a practical survey of Politics in the Nineteenth Century. The public<br />\nand inter-class debate in the spring will be<br />\nbased on the subject matter of the winter's<br />\nstudies. i. his thorough preparation will forcefully and brilliantly arm the contestants.<br />\nMore time this year will be given to open<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ndebate, as but two speakers on each side will<br />\nregularly be assigned.<br />\nThe Freshmen class is divided into sections<br />\nfor the study of Description, Narration, Exposition and Argument, as used in speaking.<br />\nNo text is available for the course, because of<br />\nits practical nature, so a syllabus prepared<br />\nby Dr. Lee, issued week by week, will be used.<br />\nThe class will participate in the contest in<br />\npublic speaking next spring.<br />\n<br />\nsunriAri.<br />\nDere ez a soun' ob Summah in de air;<br />\nSweet music am wafted on de breeze:<br />\nHyeah de crickets chirpin' in de low grass,<br />\nWhile de frogs air trillin' in de trees.<br />\nHan' en han' we wu walkin' thoo de meddah,<br />\nWif de moonbeams spawklin' on huh ha'ar,<br />\n'Twell my hea't wu' a'trippin' lak a hammah,<br />\nEz I gaze on my 'Liza Ann so fair.<br />\nIt seem lak de Heabens gone done open,<br />\nWif de angels ahoy' rin all aroun';<br />\n0 true-love, de Glory-Lan' wu' breakin'I<br />\nGold an' silba lay scattud o' de groun'.<br />\nWe ling'ud by de gate neah de yellums;<br />\nI drew clos'a, stan'in' by huh side,<br />\nHuh haid res'in' sof'ly on my should'a\u2014<br />\nI pine den to tek huh fo' my bride.<br />\nPorn my hea't came de words dat I whisp'ud,<br />\nSof' en low, whisp'ud only fo' huh ears;<br />\nOn huh cheek a di'mun' seem to glis'en;\u2014<br />\nWif huh han' she breshed away de tears.<br />\nDen I know dat 'Liza Ann, my true-love,<br />\nHuh hea't en han' hed given unt'a me;<br />\nCould I ask fo' any futh'a promise?\u2014<br />\nMy bride, flex' come Chrismus, huh will be.<br />\nHi!

For the new students it has a word<br />\nof greeting. We would call their attention to<br />\nthe fact that this is the only publication of its<br />\nkind at the University. It is not a literary<br />\nmagazine, nor a comic journal, but primarily<br />\na newspaper. It is distinctly an amateur effort, and the editors gain nothing but experience. The fact that we try to represent so<br />\nmany diverse elements makes the problem difficult. It also makes it right for us to expect<br />\nthe undivided allegiance of the students. We<br />\nhope to have as subscribers this year, practically all the undergraduates and very many<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\nLast spring at Maryland Oval, Hopkins<br />\nwon with the greatest case the championship<br />\nof the Maryland Intercollegiate Association.<br />\nA few weeks ago, with scarcely greater difficulty, we carried off the championship in the<br />\ngatnes of the Maryland Athletic Union. These<br />\nassociations include practically all the track<br />\nand field teams in the State, and these victories give Hopkins a clear title to athletic supremacy in her own neighborhood. This supremacy we can easily maintain, and it be-<br />\n<br />\nhooves us, while keeping up our present standard, to look beyond our borders for more<br />\nworthy opponents. Our athletes should begin<br />\nat once to think about the American Intercollegiate games for next year. In this connection, the most encouraging sign of the times is<br />\nthe appointment of Mr. Mackdermott to have<br />\nfull charge of the outdoor sports of the University. Mr. Mackdermott's efficiency as a<br />\ncoach,and his interest in Hopkins affairs, have<br />\nbeen abundantly proved, and the agreement<br />\nbetween the Athletic Association and the trustees which resulted in his appointment was a<br />\nmost happy one.<br />\nAlthough our representatives in the volunteer army in the late war with Spain did not<br />\nreach the scene of actual conflict, and we have<br />\nno wounded heroes to idolize, nevertheless the<br />\nwar has touched us on many sides, and we may<br />\nclaim some share at least in its glory. Besides<br />\nthose who were actually mustered into the service of the government with the Maryland National Guard, we must remember the others<br />\nin the cavalry and artillery who were ready<br />\nand anxious to go. Nurses from the Medical<br />\nSchool were active in the work of the Red<br />\nCross. Some of our electricians were engaged<br />\nin harbor defense at Baltimore. A member<br />\nof the University faculty is now absent on<br />\nduty, and our president was offered a place on<br />\nthe commission to inquire into the affairs of<br />\nthe war department.<br />\nEvents since the mass-meeting last term<br />\nhave proved the truth of President Gilman's<br />\nassertion that the government did not need us,<br />\nand have fully justified Prof. Adams' advice<br />\nabout going off at half cock. Our military<br />\ncompany began bravely, and diminished in<br />\nrapid progression until there were few left to<br />\ndisband. Fortunately the suggestion of some<br />\nover-zealous ones, that military training be<br />\nmade a prominent feature here, died with<br />\nthe company. Such things are all right in<br />\ntime of war, but at other times we can wisely<br />\nleave them to \"prep\" schools, to whom they<br />\nbelong.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nBOOK NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no rest for the weary librarian.<br />\nHe has steadfastly to stick to his books.

The Abbe Library<br />\nnumbers about fifteen hundred volumes, and<br />\nwill be in the charge of Mr. Fassig, late of the<br />\nWashington Bureau Library, now connected<br />\nwith the Weather Service here and aS a lecturer in the University.<br />\nA glance over the exhibit of the New Book<br />\nDepartment brings to light de Tocqueville's<br />\n\"Democracy in America,\" with an introduction by President Gilman; \"The State,\" by<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, in a revised edition; and<br />\nthe second volume of \"The Historical Development of Modern Europe,\" by 'Charles M.<br />\nAndrews (Ph.

The most important<br />\nprize was \"The News Cup,\" which was offered<br />\nto the club scoring the highest number of<br />\npoints, and which will become the permanent<br />\nproperty of the club first winning three championships (not necessarily in succession).<br />\nThis cup is now on exhibition with other Hopkins prizes in the Trophy Room.<br />\nThe men composing our team deserve the<br />\nmore credit in view of the fact that the games<br />\nwere held before the beginning of our school<br />\nyear, when a number of our men were out of<br />\ntown.<br />\nNevertheless enough men were collected to<br />\nrepresent us in most events, and to score for<br />\nus twice as many points as our nearest competitor.<br />\nThe day was perfect, except that a strong<br />\nwind was blowing up the finish. In consequence of a hard rain on the previous day the<br />\ntrack was in poor condition. However, records went smashing, and new State championships were established. In the first event, the<br />\nmo-yard dash, Hopkins won first and second.<br />\nKnapp ran in his usual form, and won first in<br />\nJo 3-5 seconds, breaking the previous State<br />\nrecord of 10 4-5. Talty was a close second.<br />\nIn the 220 Knapp continued his good work,<br />\nwinning first in 24 seconds, and establishing<br />\nanother State record. The former record was<br />\n24 3-5. C. T. Clark made second place in the<br />\n88o-yard run, crossing the tape close behind<br />\nC. W. Hammill, of the Y. M. C. A. In the<br />\nmile run, unfortunately Hopkins did not get<br />\na place. We have, however, every reason to<br />\nbe proud of the work of R. T. Abercrombie,<br />\nwho ran until he dropped. Had he been in his<br />\nusual condition he would doubtless have won<br />\na place. While nearly everything was going<br />\n<br />\nour way on the track, it was much the same<br />\nin the field. In the running high jump Garrett won third and Weedon fourth. In the<br />\nother events in which Garrett was entered he<br />\nwon first, making new State records for the<br />\nrunning hop, step and jump and 16-111 hammer throw. In the former his distance was 42<br />\nfeet 10 inches, and he threw the hammer 107<br />\nfeet 8 1-2 inches. In putting the 16-lb. shot<br />\nhe covered 37 feet 7 1-2 inches. H. S. Whitman won third, with 32 feet 4 1-2 inches, and<br />\nT. Fitzgerald fourth, 27 feet 5 1-2 inches. Garrett's running broad jump was 21 feet 2 inches,<br />\nand he threw the discus 95 feet 9 inches. In<br />\nthe latter event Fitzgerald was second, with<br />\n89 feet 2 inches, and Whitman third, 86 feet<br />\n2 inches.<br />\nW. Weedon won second place in the running hop, step and jump, with 41 feet 10 1-4<br />\ninches.<br />\nThomas Fitzgerald ran a beautiful race in<br />\nthe 440-yard run, winning first in 56 3-5 seconds. Morfit Mullen finished close up, winning third. In the bicycle races, which were<br />\nconsiderably mixed up and run on a track ill<br />\nsuited to the purpose, we had no representatives.<br />\nThe last and most interesting event was the<br />\none-mile relay, which Hopkins won hands<br />\ndown, in 3 minutes 46 3-5 seconds.<br />\nThe team was composed of S. P. Smith, Geo.<br />\nW. Knapp, Jr., J. M. Mullen and T. Fitzgerald, Jr. Smith, the new man on the team, ran<br />\nwell, leading from the start. The other men<br />\neasily increased the lead. Much of the credit<br />\nof our easy victory is due to the coaching of<br />\nMr. Wm. M.

Quite the contrary! He has\u2014<br />\nprobably all his life, certainly through the<br />\nterm of his college and university existence\u2014<br />\nworked harder and revelled less than the most<br />\nof his companions. Even now he is mortifying his flesh for the good of his higher nature<br />\nby incessant studying, both night and day.<br />\nHow absurd, then, that anyone should project<br />\nthe leavening of his stern rectitude with a little more of human frailty, and call that\u2014his<br />\nsalvation. And yet he needs just this. He<br />\nmay have withstood the temptations of drinking, gambling, loafing, and all the rest. He<br />\nmust still be saved from himself; that is, from<br />\nthe conditions which at present surround him.<br />\nThe truth of this will become evident on a<br />\nlittle reflection. When a man enters upon<br />\nsome special graduate work, he finds that his<br />\ndepartment gives him much more of advantages than of time in which to avail himself<br />\nof them. These advantages have, perhaps,<br />\ncost him some sacrifice to obtain, while to enjoy them he has only this one opportunity.<br />\nSo he feels\u2014and justly\u2014the need of compressing all outside demands on his time into<br />\nthe smallest bounds possible, that he may<br />\ngive the utmost of it to his specialty.<br />\nBut though this cramming of his time is<br />\nnecessary, there is yet attendant on it a twofold danger. In the first place, his nervous<br />\nsystem is bound to suffer from the unremitting tax upon it; the importance of this point,<br />\nanyone who reads the article in Outing of Oc-<br /><br />\nNo<br /><br />\ntober 1st on Relaxation is sure to recognize.<br />\nAnd, in the second place, he is liable to undergo that of the sympathies, involved in pure<br />\nspecialization, and fatal to him if he intends<br />\nto take a place, and a worthy one, in life. For<br />\nhow can a teacher, for instance, get the best<br />\nresults from the men under him, unless he is<br />\nin actual comprehending sympathy with the<br />\nnature of each of them? And how can he be<br />\nin such sympathy, when he has renounced the<br />\nworld about him for a narrow double ego\u2014<br />\nhimself and his special line of study? I do<br />\nnot say that this has actually happened to<br />\nmany, or even any, of our graduates; but I<br />\nbelieve it to be a danger which threatens all.<br />\nTo counteract this dangerous tendency,<br />\nthere are at present no means at his hand.<br />\nNone, at least, within the University. He<br />\nmay go into society, should he possess or be<br />\nable to form an outside circle of friends.<br />\nShould he do so, it is bound to prove a serious<br />\ndistraction and handicap to his work. But<br />\nof the companionship most likely to be of<br />\nvalue to himself\u2014the men of other departments of his own University, whose life and<br />\npurposes lie along the same lines as his<br />\nown, yet who have, from the difference of<br />\ntheir work, a certain refreshing difference<br />\nof ideas\u2014of this he has none. He may<br />\nmeet them at boarding-house or fraternity;<br />\nhe may have known them before he came<br />\nhere. But as far as his university existence<br />\ngoes, there is no reason whatever why he<br />\nshould ever come to know them. There is,<br />\nindeed, a -Graduate Students' Association\"<br />\nwhose name would imply some commingling<br />\nof its members.

The general acceptance of<br />\nthe work done last year, the favorable appearance of the contestants in public debate, and<br />\nevident appreciation on the part of the men,<br />\nhas Sled to an increase of hours for the course<br />\nand a broadening of its scope. The instruction will be given, as last year, by Dr. Guy<br />\nCarleton Lee.<br />\nThe Senior and Junior classes will meet an<br />\nhour weekly, with the exception of the winter<br />\nterm, when the Seniors will meet every other<br />\nweek only. The Senior class, as formerly,<br />\nwill be organized as a Senate; the Juniors as<br />\na House of Representatives. This College<br />\nCongress, however, will convene only on alternate weeks; every second week will'be devoted to class instruction in Parliamentary<br />\nLaw and Practice, extemporaneous speaking<br />\nand debate. In the Senior class no text book<br />\nwill be employed other than a syllabus prepared by Dr. Lee. As a work of reference, \"Roberts's Parliamentary Syllabus\" and<br />\n\"Rules of Order\" will be used by the Junior<br />\nclass.<br />\nIn addition to the regular weekly meetings,<br />\nconferences will be arranged for the upper<br />\nclassmen, for the study of methods of collecting and sifting evidence, drawing briefs and<br />\npreparation for debate.<br />\nA happy innovation in the College Congress will be the arrangement in a related series of the subjects for debate. Each topic will<br />\nbe some phase of the great question of Territorial Expansion now so widely agitated. The<br />\nsubjects will be so planned that there will be<br />\nno interlocking of arguments, and the entire<br />\nseries will furnish a practical survey of Politics in the Nineteenth Century.

For the new students it has a word<br />\nof greeting. We would call their attention to<br />\nthe fact that this is the only publication of its<br />\nkind at the University. It is not a literary<br />\nmagazine, nor a comic journal, but primarily<br />\na newspaper. It is distinctly an amateur effort, and the editors gain nothing but experience. The fact that we try to represent so<br />\nmany diverse elements makes the problem difficult. It also makes it right for us to expect<br />\nthe undivided allegiance of the students. We<br />\nhope to have as subscribers this year, practically all the undergraduates and very many<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\nLast spring at Maryland Oval, Hopkins<br />\nwon with the greatest case the championship<br />\nof the Maryland Intercollegiate Association.<br />\nA few weeks ago, with scarcely greater difficulty, we carried off the championship in the<br />\ngatnes of the Maryland Athletic Union. These<br />\nassociations include practically all the track<br />\nand field teams in the State, and these victories give Hopkins a clear title to athletic supremacy in her own neighborhood. This supremacy we can easily maintain, and it be-<br /><br />\nhooves us, while keeping up our present standard, to look beyond our borders for more<br />\nworthy opponents. Our athletes should begin<br />\nat once to think about the American Intercollegiate games for next year. In this connection, the most encouraging sign of the times is<br />\nthe appointment of Mr. Mackdermott to have<br />\nfull charge of the outdoor sports of the University. Mr. Mackdermott's efficiency as a<br />\ncoach,and his interest in Hopkins affairs, have<br />\nbeen abundantly proved, and the agreement<br />\nbetween the Athletic Association and the trustees which resulted in his appointment was a<br />\nmost happy one.<br />\nAlthough our representatives in the volunteer army in the late war with Spain did not<br />\nreach the scene of actual conflict, and we have<br />\nno wounded heroes to idolize, nevertheless the<br />\nwar has touched us on many sides, and we may<br />\nclaim some share at least in its glory. Besides<br />\nthose who were actually mustered into the service of the government with the Maryland National Guard, we must remember the others<br />\nin the cavalry and artillery who were ready<br />\nand anxious to go. Nurses from the Medical<br />\nSchool were active in the work of the Red<br />\nCross. Some of our electricians were engaged<br />\nin harbor defense at Baltimore. A member<br />\nof the University faculty is now absent on<br />\nduty, and our president was offered a place on<br />\nthe commission to inquire into the affairs of<br />\nthe war department.<br />\nEvents since the mass-meeting last term<br />\nhave proved the truth of President Gilman's<br />\nassertion that the government did not need us,<br />\nand have fully justified Prof. Adams' advice<br />\nabout going off at half cock. Our military<br />\ncompany began bravely, and diminished in<br />\nrapid progression until there were few left to<br />\ndisband. Fortunately the suggestion of some<br />\nover-zealous ones, that military training be<br />\nmade a prominent feature here, died with<br />\nthe company. Such things are all right in<br />\ntime of war, but at other times we can wisely<br />\nleave them to \"prep\" schools, to whom they<br />\nbelong.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nBOOK NOTES.<br /><br />\nThere is no rest for the weary librarian.<br />\nHe has steadfastly to stick to his books. All<br />\nthe libraries have been thoroughly overhauled<br />\nduring the summer, and there were many valuable accessions to the Hopkins' collections.<br />\nDr. Keidel devoted the greater part of the<br />\nsummer to cataloguing and rearranging the<br />\nbooks of the department of Romance Languages.<br />\nProfessor Cleveland Abbe's rich library on<br />\nMeteorology has come to Hopkins. The collection is regarded as one of the most complete on the subject in this country, with the<br />\nexception, perhaps, of that at the Weather<br />\nBureau in Washington. The Abbe Library<br />\nnumbers about fifteen hundred volumes, and<br />\nwill be in the charge of Mr. Fassig, late of the<br />\nWashington Bureau Library, now connected<br />\nwith the Weather Service here and aS a lecturer in the University.<br />\nA glance over the exhibit of the New Book<br />\nDepartment brings to light de Tocqueville's<br />\n\"Democracy in America,\" with an introduction by President Gilman; \"The State,\" by<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, in a revised edition; and<br />\nthe second volume of \"The Historical Development of Modern Europe,\" by 'Charles M.<br />\nAndrews (Ph.

The most important<br />\nprize was \"The News Cup,\" which was offered<br />\nto the club scoring the highest number of<br />\npoints, and which will become the permanent<br />\nproperty of the club first winning three championships (not necessarily in succession).<br />\nThis cup is now on exhibition with other Hopkins prizes in the Trophy Room.<br />\nThe men composing our team deserve the<br />\nmore credit in view of the fact that the games<br />\nwere held before the beginning of our school<br />\nyear, when a number of our men were out of<br />\ntown.<br />\nNevertheless enough men were collected to<br />\nrepresent us in most events, and to score for<br />\nus twice as many points as our nearest competitor.<br />\nThe day was perfect, except that a strong<br />\nwind was blowing up the finish. In consequence of a hard rain on the previous day the<br />\ntrack was in poor condition. However, records went smashing, and new State championships were established. In the first event, the<br />\nmo-yard dash, Hopkins won first and second.<br />\nKnapp ran in his usual form, and won first in<br />\nJo 3-5 seconds, breaking the previous State<br />\nrecord of 10 4-5. Talty was a close second.<br />\nIn the 220 Knapp continued his good work,<br />\nwinning first in 24 seconds, and establishing<br />\nanother State record. The former record was<br />\n24 3-5. C. T. Clark made second place in the<br />\n88o-yard run, crossing the tape close behind<br />\nC. W. Hammill, of the Y. M. C. A. In the<br />\nmile run, unfortunately Hopkins did not get<br />\na place. We have, however, every reason to<br />\nbe proud of the work of R. T. Abercrombie,<br />\nwho ran until he dropped. Had he been in his<br />\nusual condition he would doubtless have won<br />\na place. While nearly everything was going<br /><br />\nour way on the track, it was much the same<br />\nin the field. In the running high jump Garrett won third and Weedon fourth. In the<br />\nother events in which Garrett was entered he<br />\nwon first, making new State records for the<br />\nrunning hop, step and jump and 16-111 hammer throw. In the former his distance was 42<br />\nfeet 10 inches, and he threw the hammer 107<br />\nfeet 8 1-2 inches. In putting the 16-lb. shot<br />\nhe covered 37 feet 7 1-2 inches. H. S. Whitman won third, with 32 feet 4 1-2 inches, and<br />\nT. Fitzgerald fourth, 27 feet 5 1-2 inches. Garrett's running broad jump was 21 feet 2 inches,<br />\nand he threw the discus 95 feet 9 inches. In<br />\nthe latter event Fitzgerald was second, with<br />\n89 feet 2 inches, and Whitman third, 86 feet<br />\n2 inches.<br />\nW. Weedon won second place in the running hop, step and jump, with 41 feet 10 1-4<br />\ninches.<br />\nThomas Fitzgerald ran a beautiful race in<br />\nthe 440-yard run, winning first in 56 3-5 seconds. Morfit Mullen finished close up, winning third. In the bicycle races, which were<br />\nconsiderably mixed up and run on a track ill<br />\nsuited to the purpose, we had no representatives.<br />\nThe last and most interesting event was the<br />\none-mile relay, which Hopkins won hands<br />\ndown, in 3 minutes 46 3-5 seconds.<br />\nThe team was composed of S. P. Smith, Geo.<br />\nW. Knapp, Jr., J. M. Mullen and T. Fitzgerald, Jr. Smith, the new man on the team, ran<br />\nwell, leading from the start. The other men<br />\neasily increased the lead.
