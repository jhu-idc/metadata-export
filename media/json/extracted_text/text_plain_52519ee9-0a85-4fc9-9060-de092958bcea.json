The former, finding this enticing<br />\nweapon so readily within his grasp, is often carried away by his more<br />\nor less venomous attitude and rather than being coldly critical and<br />\nconstructive be becomqs vulgarly insulting\u2014a condition vividly illustrated in this university in several notorious cases. This unfortunate<br />\ntendency, with some exceptions, seems due to a fervent desire to rise<br />\nbeyond the bounds of the conventional and commonplace to the plane<br />\nof originality. It is a laudable craving, no one is more uninteresting<br />\nor exasperating than the confirmed, self-satisfied Victorian. Yet<br />\noriginal criticism must also be intelligent and not have to include disparagement and insult to command the attention. It must be in good<br />\ntaste and good taste does not look to conventionalism for its limits.<br />\nIt is only to the conventional and narrowminded themselves that it<br />\never does o. However, good taste and intelligence to a great extent<br />\ndo walk hand in hand and if the critic would desire to cater to the<br />\nintelligensia he should also cater to this sense of good taste.<br />\nThe criticised we find are affected by criticisms in two ways. On<br />\nthe one hand we find smug indifference and on the other garrulous<br />\nsavageness. In truth, both are but different attitudes occasioned by<br />\nthe same fundamental fault; that is, utter disregard of any intelligent<br />\nopinions which the critic may, with a serious desire at improvement,<br />\nhave advanced. This fault may not be so clear in the overferocious<br />\nas in the indifferent. The former seldom considers the critic's arguments as an attempt at helpfulness, which sometimes it is, but rather<br />\nas a vengeful assault upon his personal honor. He enters the fray<br />\nmuch in the same attitude as the aforementioned critic and childish<br />\nepistles fly back and forth in puerile enmity. It is a question which is<br />\nthe worse evil. In neither case is the critic given the answer which<br />\nthe merits of his observations deserve.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is the only organ of University opinion and,<br />\nas such, it is its policy to print whatever matter it can of this kind that<br />\nis responsibly submitted to it. It seems that in an intellectual institution like the Johns Hopkins University intelligent criticisms should<br />\nappear, be accepted and answered as such, no matter to what member<br />\nor department of the institution, student, faculty, or administrative it<br />\nmay be addressed. We hope that in the future we will receive just<br />\ncriticisms and that these criticisms be given the importance they<br />\ndeserve.<br />\n<br />\nBIOLOGY I<br />\non the subject of criticisms we are reminded of one that<br />\nWHILE<br />\nhas oftentimes been brought, usually humorously, however, to<br />\nour attention. That is, the untrustworthiness of the college catalogues.<br />\nWe would like to point to a specific case.<br />\nThree lecture classes and two laboratory periods have been prescribed as the required hours for Biology I. However, upon enquiring<br />\nfrom several students we find that the biology department assigns so<br />\nmuch laboratory work that it is impossible for the students to complete<br />\nthe material unless the equivalent of at least three afternoons are spent<br />\nin the laboratory each week. This procedure is not only unfair to the<br />\nstudents, who receive no credit for the compulsory time spent, but<br />\nalso to the other departments of the University, who must suffer when<br />\nthe students discover this unforeseen drain on their time. If the biology<br />\ndepartment requires more than two afternoons a week in which to<br />\npresent its course, then official recognition should be made of the fact<br />\nand due credit given.<br />\nN.

The former, finding this enticing<br />\nweapon so readily within his grasp, is often carried away by his more<br />\nor less venomous attitude and rather than being coldly critical and<br />\nconstructive be becomqs vulgarly insulting\u2014a condition vividly illustrated in this university in several notorious cases. This unfortunate<br />\ntendency, with some exceptions, seems due to a fervent desire to rise<br />\nbeyond the bounds of the conventional and commonplace to the plane<br />\nof originality. It is a laudable craving, no one is more uninteresting<br />\nor exasperating than the confirmed, self-satisfied Victorian. Yet<br />\noriginal criticism must also be intelligent and not have to include disparagement and insult to command the attention. It must be in good<br />\ntaste and good taste does not look to conventionalism for its limits.<br />\nIt is only to the conventional and narrowminded themselves that it<br />\never does o. However, good taste and intelligence to a great extent<br />\ndo walk hand in hand and if the critic would desire to cater to the<br />\nintelligensia he should also cater to this sense of good taste.<br />\nThe criticised we find are affected by criticisms in two ways. On<br />\nthe one hand we find smug indifference and on the other garrulous<br />\nsavageness. In truth, both are but different attitudes occasioned by<br />\nthe same fundamental fault; that is, utter disregard of any intelligent<br />\nopinions which the critic may, with a serious desire at improvement,<br />\nhave advanced. This fault may not be so clear in the overferocious<br />\nas in the indifferent. The former seldom considers the critic's arguments as an attempt at helpfulness, which sometimes it is, but rather<br />\nas a vengeful assault upon his personal honor. He enters the fray<br />\nmuch in the same attitude as the aforementioned critic and childish<br />\nepistles fly back and forth in puerile enmity. It is a question which is<br />\nthe worse evil. In neither case is the critic given the answer which<br />\nthe merits of his observations deserve.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is the only organ of University opinion and,<br />\nas such, it is its policy to print whatever matter it can of this kind that<br />\nis responsibly submitted to it. It seems that in an intellectual institution like the Johns Hopkins University intelligent criticisms should<br />\nappear, be accepted and answered as such, no matter to what member<br />\nor department of the institution, student, faculty, or administrative it<br />\nmay be addressed. We hope that in the future we will receive just<br />\ncriticisms and that these criticisms be given the importance they<br />\ndeserve.<br /><br />\nBIOLOGY I<br />\non the subject of criticisms we are reminded of one that<br />\nWHILE<br />\nhas oftentimes been brought, usually humorously, however, to<br />\nour attention. That is, the untrustworthiness of the college catalogues.<br />\nWe would like to point to a specific case.<br />\nThree lecture classes and two laboratory periods have been prescribed as the required hours for Biology I. However, upon enquiring<br />\nfrom several students we find that the biology department assigns so<br />\nmuch laboratory work that it is impossible for the students to complete<br />\nthe material unless the equivalent of at least three afternoons are spent<br />\nin the laboratory each week. This procedure is not only unfair to the<br />\nstudents, who receive no credit for the compulsory time spent, but<br />\nalso to the other departments of the University, who must suffer when<br />\nthe students discover this unforeseen drain on their time. If the biology<br />\ndepartment requires more than two afternoons a week in which to<br />\npresent its course, then official recognition should be made of the fact<br />\nand due credit given.<br />\nN.
