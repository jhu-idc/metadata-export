Mahoney, president of<br />\nthe A. A. U., who repeats again and again that \"Germany is governed by discriminations\" in spite of the<br />\npromises that Mr. Hitler made, evidently with his<br />\ntongue in his cheek, to give all an equal opportunity to<br />\nmake the German Olympic team.

Vassos deplores the<br />\nfact that artists are not able to fit<br />\ninto the present scheme Of things and<br />\nroundly condemns those who make<br />\npersonal adjustments by wandering<br />\ninto such \"experimental and disassociated expressions\" and cubism and<br />\nsurrealism. Holding that art is necessary in bringing order and clarity<br />\nto that confused mass of outworn<br />\ntradition, accumulated cruelties, irrationalism, and creeds of false prophets which make up our presentday systems, Vassos praises the work<br />\nof Rivera, Thomas Benton and<br />\nBoardman Robinson as pointing the<br />\nway to a useful conception of art.<br />\nArtists must, he holds, participate in<br />\nthe scene in which they live.<br />\nAnd so John Vassos surveys contemporary life, and the result is a<br />\nmedley of emotional reactions to \"the<br />\ndead ends and blind alleys from<br />\nwhich there seems to be no escape.\"<br />\nHis reactions are those of the average intelligent man. Why is it, he<br />\nwonders, that starvation exists in the<br />\nmidst of plenty? He pictures it by<br />\nshowing a breadline patiently waiting against the wall of a building in<br />\nwhich are stored bags of grain. But<br />\nthis is a paradox which has worried<br />\nsome people centuries before John<br />\nVassos developed a social conscience.<br />\nIn another case he pictures a philanthropist building bird baths, singing<br />\ntowers, stone drinking fountains for<br />\nhorses, and libraries in tenement district, while Cossacks, dressed in<br />\ntheir traditional blue uniforms, drive<br />\nstarving people away from his door.<br />\nHe wonders at the justice in the fact<br />\nthat in many professions able and<br />\neager men are turned away simply<br />\nbecause they are black.

But<br />\nthis is a paradox which has worried<br />\nsome people centuries before John<br />\nVassos developed a social conscience.<br />\nIn another case he pictures a philanthropist building bird baths, singing<br />\ntowers, stone drinking fountains for<br />\nhorses, and libraries in tenement district, while Cossacks, dressed in<br />\ntheir traditional blue uniforms, drive<br />\nstarving people away from his door.<br />\nHe wonders at the justice in the fact<br />\nthat in many professions able and<br />\neager men are turned away simply<br />\nbecause they are black.

In defeating<br />\nthe array from Salisbury State Teachers' College, which previous to this<br />\nencounter had defeated our boys by<br />\na 4-1 score, the Dotterweich Demons<br />\nably demonstrated their superiority.<br />\nThe Hopkins horde triumphed, 1-0.<br />\nThe score, though an indication of<br />\nthe final result, in no way typifies<br />\nthe spirit and ability displayed by<br />\nthe victors. Held scoreless until the<br />\nfinal two minutes of the last quarter, they finally broke through to<br />\nput a well-placed shot by the Teachers' net tender.<br />\nFirst Half Tight<br />\nThe game see-sawed throughout<br />\nthe first half, with neither team<br />\nshowing any distinct superiority. No<br />\ndoubt the ,Blue and Black aggregation could have used the assistance<br />\nof their star halfback, Billy McClean,<br />\nwho was not present. However, with<br />\nthe return of the booters for the<br />\nsecond half of the fray, the soccerites representing Hopkins led off<br />\nwith a determined attack. Repelled<br />\nby some fine defensive work on the<br />\npart of Long and Gibbons of Salisbury, the Blue attack finally broke<br />\nthrough in the form of McKinney,<br />\nwho scored what proved to be the<br />\nwinning shot. The score resulted<br />\nfrom a scrimmage in the front of<br />\nthe goal with McKinney, who was<br />\nhurt earlier in the encounter, finally<br />\nkicking the ball outside the reach<br />\nof the goalie with a low corner shot.<br />\nThroughout, the game was marked<br />\nby the outstanding playing of such<br />\nJays as Hartke, Clisham, Bernheim,<br />\nand Captain Randall. By his excellent showing in the affair on Saturday, Randall bids fair to become a<br />\nmember of that mythical organization, the All-State Soccer Team.<br />\nCoach Dotterweich showed excellent ability as a mentor in the manner in which he conducted the affair<br />\nfrom the sidelines.
