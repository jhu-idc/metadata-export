With the imposing,<br />\nAcademic Building as a background, the lofty flagpoles aspiring skyward and flying their precious emblems, the group of relatives and intimate friends assembled beneath the stately portico and the Hopkins battalion in<br />\nline facing all these\u2014what setting<br />\ncould be more magnificent or more<br />\nsignificant for a dedication! All<br />\nwere assembled to commenorate<br />\nthe sacrifice of Robert Layfield<br />\nfor Hopkins. The dean sounded the fundamental note of the ocpasion\u2014the symbolisms and meaning of the monument to Layfield. . Through him<br />\nthe University paid tribute to Layfield; through their representative, the students spoke their sincere appreciation of .hirti; and<br />\n\u201e through the doctor who was Layfield's constant companion in his<br />\nlast battle, his relatives and<br />\nfriends expressed their love for<br />\nhim.<br />\nLayfield is remembered for his<br />\nindomitable spirit, his pluck, his<br />\nclean and honorable manhood, for<br />\nhis many other virtues\u2014all worthy of emulation. Those who<br />\nknew him in his dreary months of<br />\nconfinement recall with admiration his radiant and hopeful smile,<br />\nhis confidence of recovery and his<br />\ncourageous fight to his last breath.<br />\nThose flagpoles symbolize the<br />\nfirmness and loftiness of his prin-<br />\n<br />\nciples, the principles of the University, the principles of these<br />\nUnited States. The one bears the<br />\nflag of the University, the institution for which Layfield gave his<br />\nlife; the other displays the flag of<br />\nour country, the land for which<br />\nwe are prepared to sacrifice our<br />\nlives. The one signifies the inspiring motto of Johns Hopkins University, \"Veritas Vos Liberabit\";<br />\nthe other represents the transcendent principles of the American democracy\u2014liberty and justice.<br />\nThe pole bearing this flag was<br />\nerected by the students, who,<br />\ngarbed in the uniform of its defenders and imbued with the spirit<br />\nof his sacrifice, dedicated it as a<br />\nmonument to Layfield and the<br />\nprinciples he embodied. But in a<br />\nlarger sense they were dedicating<br />\nthemselves to the service of their<br />\ncountry, pledging themselves to<br />\nsupreme sacrifice for the emblem<br />\nwhich the memorial to Layfield<br />\nbears\u2014the American flag.<br />\nWells the Patriot.<br />\n<br />\nThe news of the death of Clifford Almon Wells, '14, first lieutenant in the Canadian Army,<br />\ncame as a severe shock to his fellow-students at Hopkins. Though<br />\na Canadian by birth, he was so<br />\nlong a resident of Baltimore and<br />\nother places in the United States<br />\nthat it might have been supposed<br />\nthat his allegiance to his old home<br />\nwas eclipsed by his devotion to<br />\nthis country. Yet when Canada<br />\nwas called upon by England to<br />\nsacrifice the best of its splendid<br />\nmanhood, Wells, for no other reason than a high-minded sense , of<br />\nduty, gave himself to the service<br />\nof his home country. He did not<br />\nhave to go. No legal obligation<br />\ncompelled his return to Canada.<br />\nBut his inborn love of his native<br />\nland,his lofty appreciation of duty,<br />\nbore him to the colors and won<br />\nfor him in his many engagements<br />\na commission and the high esteem<br />\nof all who had intercourse with<br />\nhim. May the exalted idea of duty<br />\nwhich stirred him to action inspire all other Hopkins men.<br />\nA Hopkins Ambulance Unit.<br />\n<br />\nIf Hopkins is to have an ambulance unit no time should be lost<br />\nin mobilizing its members. The<br />\nopportunity to go to France in<br />\nthis service should be ardently<br />\nwelcomed by those men who are<br />\nplanning to make medicine their<br />\nlife-work, and who have likewise<br />\nattained the age of decision. If<br />\nthere are those of conscription<br />\nage, possessing conscientious scruples, who would rather fight for<br />\nthe United States by conserving<br />\nthe lives of its soldiers, rather<br />\nthan by destroying those of its<br />\nenemies, let them band together<br />\nand serve their country in the<br />\nsame noble way that Layfield<br />\nserved Hopkins and Wells served<br />\nCanada, thought let us hope that<br />\ntheir rewards will not be the same.<br />\n<br />\nPROF.

At the close of his<br />\nspeech, A. C. Primrose removed<br />\nthe small American flag which<br />\nveiled the bronzed tablet on the<br />\npole given by the students, and J.<br />\nV.

Meigel,'19, and Eugene A. Edgett, '17, qualified to take part in<br />\nthe final contest. All of the<br />\nspeeches represented different<br />\nviewpoints of \"The Second French<br />\nRepublic.\"<br />\nMiegel, who was the first speaker, called the French revolution of<br />\n1848 an absolute failure and proceeded to give reasons in support<br />\nof his view.

He pictured<br />\nconditions in France before the<br />\nrevolution of 1848 and traced the<br />\ncourse of events through the revolutionary period to show that it<br />\nwas a \"step forward in the growth<br />\nof France for liberty and democracy.\"<br />\nKrieger spoke last and took a<br />\nbroader and less extreme course<br />\nthan either of the preceding<br />\nspeakers. The tone of his speech<br />\nwas expository rather than argumentative. He attributed the<br />\nrevolution of 1848 to the efforts of<br />\nLouis Lamartine. He maintained<br />\nthat \"the purpose of the revolution was to gain a more complete<br />\ndevelopment of the sovereignty of<br />\nthe people; that Lamartinewanted<br />\nto inject the republican spirit into<br />\nthe monarchy without disrupting<br />\nit; and that he hoped to accomplish his purpose through public<br />\nopinion, not through revolution.\"<br />\nHe gave a vivid description of<br />\nthe revolution and attributed its<br />\nfailure to the limitations of its<br />\nauthor\u2014Lamartine.<br />\nWhile the judges were conferring, Dr. French awarded (in<br />\nspite of the fact that the debates<br />\ndid not take place this spring)<br />\nthe University \"H\" for intercollegiate debating to the members of<br />\nthis year's team: Alexander A.<br />\nSteinbach, Eugene A.

With the imposing,<br />\nAcademic Building as a background, the lofty flagpoles aspiring skyward and flying their precious emblems, the group of relatives and intimate friends assembled beneath the stately portico and the Hopkins battalion in<br />\nline facing all these\u2014what setting<br />\ncould be more magnificent or more<br />\nsignificant for a dedication! All<br />\nwere assembled to commenorate<br />\nthe sacrifice of Robert Layfield<br />\nfor Hopkins. The dean sounded the fundamental note of the ocpasion\u2014the symbolisms and meaning of the monument to Layfield. . Through him<br />\nthe University paid tribute to Layfield; through their representative, the students spoke their sincere appreciation of .hirti; and<br />\n\u201e through the doctor who was Layfield's constant companion in his<br />\nlast battle, his relatives and<br />\nfriends expressed their love for<br />\nhim.<br />\nLayfield is remembered for his<br />\nindomitable spirit, his pluck, his<br />\nclean and honorable manhood, for<br />\nhis many other virtues\u2014all worthy of emulation. Those who<br />\nknew him in his dreary months of<br />\nconfinement recall with admiration his radiant and hopeful smile,<br />\nhis confidence of recovery and his<br />\ncourageous fight to his last breath.<br />\nThose flagpoles symbolize the<br />\nfirmness and loftiness of his prin-<br /><br />\nciples, the principles of the University, the principles of these<br />\nUnited States. The one bears the<br />\nflag of the University, the institution for which Layfield gave his<br />\nlife; the other displays the flag of<br />\nour country, the land for which<br />\nwe are prepared to sacrifice our<br />\nlives. The one signifies the inspiring motto of Johns Hopkins University, \"Veritas Vos Liberabit\";<br />\nthe other represents the transcendent principles of the American democracy\u2014liberty and justice.<br />\nThe pole bearing this flag was<br />\nerected by the students, who,<br />\ngarbed in the uniform of its defenders and imbued with the spirit<br />\nof his sacrifice, dedicated it as a<br />\nmonument to Layfield and the<br />\nprinciples he embodied. But in a<br />\nlarger sense they were dedicating<br />\nthemselves to the service of their<br />\ncountry, pledging themselves to<br />\nsupreme sacrifice for the emblem<br />\nwhich the memorial to Layfield<br />\nbears\u2014the American flag.<br />\nWells the Patriot.<br /><br />\nThe news of the death of Clifford Almon Wells, '14, first lieutenant in the Canadian Army,<br />\ncame as a severe shock to his fellow-students at Hopkins. Though<br />\na Canadian by birth, he was so<br />\nlong a resident of Baltimore and<br />\nother places in the United States<br />\nthat it might have been supposed<br />\nthat his allegiance to his old home<br />\nwas eclipsed by his devotion to<br />\nthis country. Yet when Canada<br />\nwas called upon by England to<br />\nsacrifice the best of its splendid<br />\nmanhood, Wells, for no other reason than a high-minded sense , of<br />\nduty, gave himself to the service<br />\nof his home country. He did not<br />\nhave to go. No legal obligation<br />\ncompelled his return to Canada.<br />\nBut his inborn love of his native<br />\nland,his lofty appreciation of duty,<br />\nbore him to the colors and won<br />\nfor him in his many engagements<br />\na commission and the high esteem<br />\nof all who had intercourse with<br />\nhim. May the exalted idea of duty<br />\nwhich stirred him to action inspire all other Hopkins men.<br />\nA Hopkins Ambulance Unit.<br /><br />\nIf Hopkins is to have an ambulance unit no time should be lost<br />\nin mobilizing its members. The<br />\nopportunity to go to France in<br />\nthis service should be ardently<br />\nwelcomed by those men who are<br />\nplanning to make medicine their<br />\nlife-work, and who have likewise<br />\nattained the age of decision. If<br />\nthere are those of conscription<br />\nage, possessing conscientious scruples, who would rather fight for<br />\nthe United States by conserving<br />\nthe lives of its soldiers, rather<br />\nthan by destroying those of its<br />\nenemies, let them band together<br />\nand serve their country in the<br />\nsame noble way that Layfield<br />\nserved Hopkins and Wells served<br />\nCanada, thought let us hope that<br />\ntheir rewards will not be the same.<br /><br />\nPROF.
