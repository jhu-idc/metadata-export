I recall, for<br />\nexample, a classmate named Oliver Hazard Sigafoos, a<br />\ngreat strapping fellow standing 14 hands high, who fell<br />\nin love with a beautiful Theta named Nikki Spillane,<br />\nwith hair like beaten gold and eyeballs like two tablespoons of forgetfulness.<br />\nEvery night Oliver Hazard would take Nikki out to<br />\ndine and dance, and then to dine again, for dancing made<br />\nNikki ravenous. Then they would go riding in the swan<br />\nboats, and then Nikki, her appetite sharpened by the sea<br />\nair, would have 8 or 10 cutlets, and then Oliver Hazard<br />\nwould take her home, stopping on the way to buy her a<br />\npail of oysters or two.<br />\nTo raise money for these enchanted evenings, Oliver<br />\nHazard took on a number of part-time jobs. Between<br />\nclasses he cut hair. After school he gutted perches. From<br />\ndusk to midnight he vulcanized medicine balls. From<br />\nmidnight to dawn he trapped night crawlers.<br />\nThis crowded schedule took, alas, a heavy toll from<br />\nOliver Hazard. In the space of a month he dwindled from<br />\n260 to 104 pounds\u2014but that, curiously enough, proved<br />\nhis salvation.<br />\nToday Oliver Hazard is a jockey, earning a handsome<br />\nliving which, combined with what he makes as a lymph<br />\ndonor after hours, is quite sufficient to curb Nikki's<br />\ngirlish appetite. Today they are married and live in Upper<br />\nMarlboro, Maryland, with their two daughters, Filter<br />\nand Flavor, and their son, Flip-top Box.P Max Shulman. 1957<br />\n<br />\nV1,<br />\n<br />\nBenefits and shortcomings of<br />\nthe freshmen advising program,<br />\ndirected by Dr. W.

S. Naval<br />\nAcademy.<br />\nIn 1948, Hopkins won the first official Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference football title, finished the season with a 7-1<br />\nmark, and turned down an invitation to the Tangerine<br />\nBowl game.<br />\nLast year saw the Blue Jays emulate their 1948 feat<br />\nby again copping the M-D grid Championship.<br />\nSnow was still on the ground when the Jay stickmen<br />\nbegan preparations for their bid for the National Intercollegiate Lacrosse Championship.<br />\nThe Blue Jays climaxed their seventy-fifth season by<br />\ntaking the Cyrus C. Miller trophy, emblematic of the \"A\"<br />\ndivision championship, and the Wingate trophy, signifying<br />\nthe national intercollegiate lacrosse championship.<br />\nHopkins' 11-11 tie with the Mt. Washington Lacrosse<br />\nClub to make them co-open lacrosse champions was anticlimatic.<br />\nFrisbee!<br />\nHowever, this is all ancient history now. A new<br />\nsport has Manifestpd itself on the Blue Jay athletic horizon. Frisbee!<br />\nOriginally employing beer trays, the game is rumored<br />\nto have been played by the Indians when Lief Ericson discovered America.<br />\nA nine and a quarter inch in diameter plastic discus<br />\ncalled a \"Pluto Platter\" has replaced the beer tray of<br />\nyesteryear. On the Princeton University campus, frisbee<br />\nis included in the intramural athletic program.<br />\nFrisbee Tournament<br />\nCommenting on the possibility of frisbee becoming an<br />\nintramural sport at the Hopkins, the president of the<br />\nBoard of Intramural Athletics, Stu Viess, said, \"If there's<br />\nenough interest among the independents and fraternities<br />\nto warrant a frisbee tournament, the Board of Intramural<br />\nAthletics will certainly go along- with the interest of the<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nWith wrestling now missing from the Blue Jays'<br />\nathletic program, it may not be too long until Hopkins<br />\nfields a frisbee squad. All interested students are asked<br />\nto indicate their desire by dropping a note in box 1230<br />\nin the Gilman post office.<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Gridders Retain<br />\nControversial Single Wing<br />\nA constant point of contention<br />\naround the Hopkins campus is<br />\nVarsity Football coach Wilson<br />\nFewster's preference for the<br />\nrather<br />\nsingle-wing formation<br />\nthan the more common \"T.\"<br />\nChief complaint against the<br />\nsingle wing is that almost all<br />\nboys who play high school or<br />\nfrosh football are taught the<br />\n\"T,\" and, therefore, when they<br />\ngraduate to the varsity, they<br />\nhave to learn a whole new system of plays, blocking assignments, etc.<br />\nThe Hopkins athletic policy of<br />\nno athletic scholarships and<br />\nminimized recruiting generally<br />\nresults in the Jays being outmanned and out-weighed by<br />\ntheir opponents. Therefore, a<br />\nformation is needed that can<br />\ncompensate, at least in part, for<br />\nthese deficiencies.<br />\nThe \"T\" formation, characterized by its \"bread-and-butter\"<br />\nplay, the quick opener, requires<br />\n<br />\na heavy line and tremendous<br />\nspeed both in the backfield and<br />\nin the forward wall, qualities<br />\nwhich Hopkins teams in past<br />\nyears have found difficult to<br />\nachieve.<br />\nThe single-wing, on the other<br />\nhand, requires good ball-handling and smart line play, but<br />\nlarge, powerful linemen and<br />\ntremendous backfield speed are<br />\nnot foremost in importance, the<br />\n\"power\" being provided by double and triple teaming rather<br />\nthan \"beef.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2014Levine<br />\n<br />\nSophomore linemen \"Sweets\" Winegrad and Clyod Kerschner tone up their leg muscles while looking<br />\nforward to the opener at F&M in Lanc?ster Pa. Winegrad is out for strong tackle while Kerselvner<br />\nis bidding for the weak tackle position.

They also make Marlboro cigarettes. Marlboro is<br />\nwhat I am going to talk to you about this year.<br />\nBefore beginning the current series of columns, I made<br />\nan exhaustive study of Marlboro advertising. This took<br />\nalmost four minutes. The Marlboro people don't waste<br />\nwords. They give it to you fast: \"You get a lot to like<br />\n... Flip-top Box.\"<br />\n...

What else do you need to know?<br />\nSo,with the Marlboro story quickly told, let us turn<br />\nimmediately to the chief problem of undergraduate life\u2014<br />\nthe money problem: This has always been a vexing<br />\ndilemma, even in my own college days. I recall, for<br />\nexample, a classmate named Oliver Hazard Sigafoos, a<br />\ngreat strapping fellow standing 14 hands high, who fell<br />\nin love with a beautiful Theta named Nikki Spillane,<br />\nwith hair like beaten gold and eyeballs like two tablespoons of forgetfulness.<br />\nEvery night Oliver Hazard would take Nikki out to<br />\ndine and dance, and then to dine again, for dancing made<br />\nNikki ravenous. Then they would go riding in the swan<br />\nboats, and then Nikki, her appetite sharpened by the sea<br />\nair, would have 8 or 10 cutlets, and then Oliver Hazard<br />\nwould take her home, stopping on the way to buy her a<br />\npail of oysters or two.<br />\nTo raise money for these enchanted evenings, Oliver<br />\nHazard took on a number of part-time jobs. Between<br />\nclasses he cut hair. After school he gutted perches. From<br />\ndusk to midnight he vulcanized medicine balls. From<br />\nmidnight to dawn he trapped night crawlers.<br />\nThis crowded schedule took, alas, a heavy toll from<br />\nOliver Hazard. In the space of a month he dwindled from<br />\n260 to 104 pounds\u2014but that, curiously enough, proved<br />\nhis salvation.<br />\nToday Oliver Hazard is a jockey, earning a handsome<br />\nliving which, combined with what he makes as a lymph<br />\ndonor after hours, is quite sufficient to curb Nikki's<br />\ngirlish appetite. Today they are married and live in Upper<br />\nMarlboro, Maryland, with their two daughters, Filter<br />\nand Flavor, and their son, Flip-top Box.P Max Shulman. 1957<br /><br />\nV1,<br /><br />\nBenefits and shortcomings of<br />\nthe freshmen advising program,<br />\ndirected by Dr. W.

In this way each<br />\nstudent's interests could be discussed and personal problems<br />\nthrashed out.<br /><br />\nIts function, to enable the<br />\nfreshman to orient themselves<br />\nwith the problems and systems<br />\nat the University, and to enable<br />\nan experienced faculty member<br />\nto be available at all times for<br />\nadvice and guidance, is a most<br />\nimportant one in the early life<br />\nof a University student.<br />\nHowever, the program is only<br />\nas successful as the student's<br />\nconfidence in it. This year, after<br />\nasking a number of freshmen<br />\ntheir opinions of the advising<br />\nprogram, your reporter was able<br />\nto amass a large number of<br />\npraises and some constructive<br />\ncriticism.<br />\nStudents Praise<br />\nEvery student interviewed immediately praised the amiability<br />\nand sincerity of purpose of the<br />\neleven group advisors: Messrs.

Even if not a teacher<br />\nof a certain subject, he should<br />\nbe directly concerned with that<br />\nmajor.

S. Naval<br />\nAcademy.<br />\nIn 1948, Hopkins won the first official Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference football title, finished the season with a 7-1<br />\nmark, and turned down an invitation to the Tangerine<br />\nBowl game.<br />\nLast year saw the Blue Jays emulate their 1948 feat<br />\nby again copping the M-D grid Championship.<br />\nSnow was still on the ground when the Jay stickmen<br />\nbegan preparations for their bid for the National Intercollegiate Lacrosse Championship.<br />\nThe Blue Jays climaxed their seventy-fifth season by<br />\ntaking the Cyrus C.

On the Princeton University campus, frisbee<br />\nis included in the intramural athletic program.<br />\nFrisbee Tournament<br />\nCommenting on the possibility of frisbee becoming an<br />\nintramural sport at the Hopkins, the president of the<br />\nBoard of Intramural Athletics, Stu Viess, said, \"If there's<br />\nenough interest among the independents and fraternities<br />\nto warrant a frisbee tournament, the Board of Intramural<br />\nAthletics will certainly go along- with the interest of the<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nWith wrestling now missing from the Blue Jays'<br />\nathletic program, it may not be too long until Hopkins<br />\nfields a frisbee squad.

Therefore, a<br />\nformation is needed that can<br />\ncompensate, at least in part, for<br />\nthese deficiencies.<br />\nThe \"T\" formation, characterized by its \"bread-and-butter\"<br />\nplay, the quick opener, requires<br /><br />\na heavy line and tremendous<br />\nspeed both in the backfield and<br />\nin the forward wall, qualities<br />\nwhich Hopkins teams in past<br />\nyears have found difficult to<br />\nachieve.<br />\nThe single-wing, on the other<br />\nhand, requires good ball-handling and smart line play, but<br />\nlarge, powerful linemen and<br />\ntremendous backfield speed are<br />\nnot foremost in importance, the<br />\n\"power\" being provided by double and triple teaming rather<br />\nthan \"beef.\"<br /><br />\n\u2014Levine<br /><br />\nSophomore linemen \"Sweets\" Winegrad and Clyod Kerschner tone up their leg muscles while looking<br />\nforward to the opener at F&amp;M in Lanc?ster Pa.
