No previous event or series of events has ever given the University as much advertising throughout the city or has brought into<br />\nplay as much college spirit as did the delightful affairs which culminated in the never-to-be-forgotten Senior Ball at the Hotel Betvedere. Our only misgiving is that it will be extremely difficult for<br />\nother June Weeks to equal the one of 1923.<br />\nAs Thomas M. Landy, Chairman of 1923 June Week Committee,<br />\nintimates, there were times last spring when financial success received a faint hope, a vague dream. Hopkins had never seen a June<br />\nWeek before and skeptics and conservatives needed much persuasion<br />\nbefore they decided to co-operate. Indefatigable work by certain<br />\nstudents of the University, however, succeeded in bringing about the<br />\nsuccess, of which all upper classmen are not only cognizant, but arc<br />\nproud.<br />\nThe task of the 1924 Committee should not be as difficult. The<br />\npioneers have gone ahead and laid low the worst enemies\u2014skepticism and doubt---and it should not be difficult to dispose of tickets.<br />\nThere is', however, much to be accomplished if the affairs next June<br />\nare to equal in brilliance and charm the festivities of 1923. It is essential that the Committee begin functioning immediately.<br />\n<br />\n\"GOOD MORNING\"<br />\nAt a recent meeting of the Sigma Chi Beta Society a \"cheery good<br />\nmorning\" was approved as \"the best possible means of promoting<br />\na more friendly attitude among the students at Homewood.\" For<br />\nthe past several years various organizations on the campus have<br />\nmade desultory attempts to install the \"Hello\" system. These attempts however, invariably died from lack of nourishment and it was<br />\nnothing unusual for Hopkins men to pass each other without a sign<br />\nof recognition.<br />\nWith the advent of the Freshman regulation making it compulsory for first-year men to speak to all upper classmen, conditions<br />\nhave begun to improve. The upper classes, recognizing the betterment of spirit that is being obtained, are returning the Freshmen's<br />\ngreetings and are beginning to adopt the habit themselves.<br />\nHopkins is handicapped in many ways because of the fact that it<br />\nis a \"small college.\" It should, therefore, utilize all advantages issuing from this condition. The size of the student body at Homewood makes it possible for every Hopkins man to recognize every<br />\nother Hopkins man. A state of affairs which does not exist at larger<br />\nuniversities.<br />\nWe suggest that the entire student body adopt Sigma Chi Beta's<br />\nrecommendation of a \"cheery good morning.\"<br />\n<br />\nATHLETIC OFFICIALS ENDORSE JENIFER ELECTED CHEER LEADER<br />\nAT A.

No previous event or series of events has ever given the University as much advertising throughout the city or has brought into<br />\nplay as much college spirit as did the delightful affairs which culminated in the never-to-be-forgotten Senior Ball at the Hotel Betvedere. Our only misgiving is that it will be extremely difficult for<br />\nother June Weeks to equal the one of 1923.<br />\nAs Thomas M. Landy, Chairman of 1923 June Week Committee,<br />\nintimates, there were times last spring when financial success received a faint hope, a vague dream. Hopkins had never seen a June<br />\nWeek before and skeptics and conservatives needed much persuasion<br />\nbefore they decided to co-operate. Indefatigable work by certain<br />\nstudents of the University, however, succeeded in bringing about the<br />\nsuccess, of which all upper classmen are not only cognizant, but arc<br />\nproud.<br />\nThe task of the 1924 Committee should not be as difficult.

It is essential that the Committee begin functioning immediately.<br /><br />\n\"GOOD MORNING\"<br />\nAt a recent meeting of the Sigma Chi Beta Society a \"cheery good<br />\nmorning\" was approved as \"the best possible means of promoting<br />\na more friendly attitude among the students at Homewood.\" For<br />\nthe past several years various organizations on the campus have<br />\nmade desultory attempts to install the \"Hello\" system. These attempts however, invariably died from lack of nourishment and it was<br />\nnothing unusual for Hopkins men to pass each other without a sign<br />\nof recognition.<br />\nWith the advent of the Freshman regulation making it compulsory for first-year men to speak to all upper classmen, conditions<br />\nhave begun to improve. The upper classes, recognizing the betterment of spirit that is being obtained, are returning the Freshmen's<br />\ngreetings and are beginning to adopt the habit themselves.<br />\nHopkins is handicapped in many ways because of the fact that it<br />\nis a \"small college.\" It should, therefore, utilize all advantages issuing from this condition. The size of the student body at Homewood makes it possible for every Hopkins man to recognize every<br />\nother Hopkins man. A state of affairs which does not exist at larger<br />\nuniversities.<br />\nWe suggest that the entire student body adopt Sigma Chi Beta's<br />\nrecommendation of a \"cheery good morning.\"<br /><br />\nATHLETIC OFFICIALS ENDORSE JENIFER ELECTED CHEER LEADER<br />\nAT A.
