But the poet, who died<br />\nheartbroken at the age of twenty-five, \"whose<br />\nname was writ in water\" is ranked today<br />\namong the first of English poets. Living he<br />\nwas \"obscurely illustrious;'' though not a<br />\nm ute,\" an 'inglorious Milton.\"<br />\nA writer in greater contrast to Keats, in<br />\nsome respects, than George Meredith, it<br />\nwould be hard to imagine. For many years<br />\n\u2014longer than the poet's life\u2014he, too, was<br />\namong the company of the \"obscurely illustrious,\" but more fortunate than Keats, he has<br />\nlived to deliver to England his full message,<br />\nhis full teaching and philosophy, and today<br />\non his eightieth birthday may justly claim the<br />\ntitle of greatest living English writer, the peer<br />\nof Fielding and of Richardson, of Scott, of<br />\nDickens and Thackeray.<br />\nSwinburne is the only living writer whose<br />\ngenius and achievement in literature rank<br />\nwith Meredith's. But their work is essentially<br />\ndifferent. Perhaps Swinburne's is the greater<br />\ngenius, but the truth of such a statement may<br />\nbe questioned. His gospel is the gospel of<br />\nregret, of longing for the past, of contempt<br />\nfor the present, of hopelessness for the future.<br />\nIn Meredith there is an wholesome humanity<br />\nand an ever-present optimism even in his<br />\ndarkest moments. He preaches a gospel of<br />\nprogress, not fanatical nor ideal, but sane,<br />\nsteady progress towards attainable ends. His<br />\nage has been in great measure out of sympathy<br />\nwith him; he has never been out of sympathy<br />\nwith his age.<br />\nThis lack of public interest in the work of<br />\nthe last of the Victorian novelists has been<br />\ntoo plainly manifested in a dense and almost<br />\nuniversal ignorance of his work. Until a few<br />\nyears ago many seemingly well-read people<br />\nhad never beard of him, or confused him<br />\nwith that able statesman and very second-rate<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\npoet \"Owen Meredith.\" As an instance of<br />\nthis ignorance, a man of sound education<br />\nasked lately if all of Meredith's novels were<br />\nin verse! But unacquainted as the general<br />\nmass of people have been with Meredith, to<br />\nthe highest classes and to the most sensitive<br />\nminds he has long strongly appealed. A<br />\nfortunate result of this is that excellent essays<br />\nand monographs\u2014both on his novels and<br />\npoetry\u2014are numerous. It will therefore be<br />\nentirely unnecessary to attempt a notice of<br />\nall his novels here. In a superficial sketch<br />\nsuch as this anything like an adequate appreciation of all his work would be impossible,<br />\nand anything less that such full treatment<br />\nwould be unfair to their author and unworthy<br />\nof the novels themselves.<br />\nGeorge Meredith is not only a novelist. He<br />\nwas first of all a poet\u2014the author of \"Love in<br />\nthe Valley,\" an Idyll which Tennyson loved.<br />\nHere that love and observance of nature<br />\nwhich is one of Meredith's strongest characteristics\u2014in common with our greatest poet<br />\n\u2014first evinces itself. A like \"morn in early<br />\nJune\" as that which must have inspired<br />\n\"Hark, hark! the lark\" is pictured for us in<br />\n'Love in the Valley.'<br />\n\"Happy happy time, when the white star hovers<br />\nLow over dim. fields fresh with bloomy dew, \u2022<br />\nNear the face of dawn, that draws athwart the darkness,<br />\nThreading it with colour, like yewberries the yew.<br />\nThicker crowd the shades as the grave East deepens<br />\nGlowing, and with crimson a long cloud swells.<br />\nMaiden still the morn is; and strange she is, and<br />\nsecret;<br />\nStrange her eyes; her cheeks are cold as cold seashells.\"<br />\n<br />\nThere is here an echo of Romeo's<br />\n\"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day,<br />\nStand tip-toe on the misty mountaid tops;\"<br />\n<br />\nand of the graver words of Horatio,<br />\n\"The morn, in russet mantle clad,<br />\nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn his verse Meredith has not contented<br />\nhimself with depicting an idyllic love amidst<br />\nidyllic surroundings. As in his novels, he<br />\nhas not feared to treat of the darker and more<br />\nproblematical sides of existence. In 'Modern<br />\nLove,\" the greatest of his poems, fifty socalled 'sonnets\" contain the tragic history of<br />\na husband and a wife who through groundless<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\njealousy have slowly drifted apart until an<br />\nimpassable barrier has arisen between them.<br />\nParts of \"Modern Love\" rise to a superb<br />\nheight of mournful beauty; particularly, \"It<br />\nis the season of the sweet wild rose,\" \"He<br />\nfound her by the ocean's moaning verge,\"<br />\nand the poem which describes the hour of<br />\ntemporary reconciliation:<br />\n\"We saw the swallows gathering in the sky,<br />\nAnd in the osier-isle we heard their noise.<br />\nWe had not to look back on summer joys,<br />\nOr forward to a summer of bright dye:<br />\nBut in the largeness of the evening earth<br />\nOur spirits grew as we went side by side.<br />\nThe hour became her husband and my bride.<br />\nLove that had robbed us so, thus blessed our dearth!<br />\nThe pilgrims of the year waxed very loud<br />\nIn multitudinous chatterings, as the flood<br />\ngull brown came from the West, and like pale<br />\nblood<br />\nExpanded to the upper crimson cloud.<br />\nLove that had robbed us of immortal things<br />\nThis little moment mercifully gave,<br />\nWhere I have seen across the twilight wave<br />\nThe swan sail with her young beneath hbr wings.\"<br />\n<br />\nMeredith has written few real .sonnets, but<br />\nof those few one at least\u2014\"Lucifer in Starlight\" is worthy of mention. The fiend<br />\n\"tired of his dark dominion\" has escaped<br />\nfrom thence and has travelled uninterrupted<br />\nover the earth until he sees \"the stars that<br />\nstill sojourn, yet still move onward\" and then<br />\nhe sinks down to hell, overwhelmed by that<br />\nvisions of \"the army of unalterable law.\"<br />\nThis recognition of \"one law, one element\"<br />\nlinks Meredith to Tennyson. But there is a<br />\nstronger bond between him, and Wordsworth<br />\nand Tennyson,\u2014it is his love of nature.<br />\n\"The Woods of Westermain,\" the poems in<br />\n\"A Reading of Earth\" and many more are of<br />\na type like Wordsworth's and Tennyson's<br />\npoems of nature. Several critics have pointed<br />\nthis out, and one at least has said that were<br />\nhis expression worthy of his thought he would<br />\nbe comparable to Wordsworth and Tennyson.<br />\nIt is not as poet, but as novelist, however,<br />\nthat Meredith holds his position today.<br />\nHis life work has been devoted to comedy.<br />\nHe has even written an essay on the Comic<br />\nSpirit and an ode to it. But the comedy of<br />\nhis novels is not like \"Twelfth Night\" and<br />\n\"As You Like It,\" but \"The Alchemist\"<br />\nand \"The Silent Woman.\" Meredith, like<br />\nJonson, pictures for us the whims, the foibles,<br />\nthe \"humors\" of society. In his work, too,<br />\n<br />\nwe notice the influence of Moliere, there are<br />\nsuggestions of \"Les Femmes Savantes\" and<br />\n\"Tartuffe.\" There are traces, too, of the influence of the greatest English follower of<br />\nMoli\u20acre,\u2014there is at times the hard glitter of<br />\n\"Love for Love\" and \"The Way of the<br />\nWorld.\"<br />\n\"The Egoist, a comedy in narrative\" is<br />\ngenerally considered his greatest work;<br />\nStevenson thought it the greatest novel ever<br />\nwritten. \"Diana of the Crossways\" is probably his most popular story. \"Harry Richmond,\" in spite of the intricasy of the plot,<br />\nis the easiest to read. 'Beauchamp's Career,\"<br />\nwith its splendid attacks on sham and conventionality, has also, by some readers, been<br />\nthought his best work. All of them are<br />\namong the greatest novels in the language.<br />\nAll are subjected more or less to the power of<br />\nthe comic spirit. But it was in a tragic theme<br />\nthat Meredith attained his greatest height.<br />\nIn \"The Ordeal of Richard Feverel\" he told<br />\na striking and terrible story, expressed his<br />\nviews on life and his scorn of hypocracy,<br />\nexpounded his philosophy, 'pointed a moral\"<br />\nand moulded a tragedy which is appealing<br />\nand heart-rending pathos ranks with \"Lear\"<br />\nand \"The Bride of Lamermoor.\"<br />\nFew writers achieve a masterpiece; far<br />\nfewer a tragic masterpiece. It requires vastly<br />\nmore moral force and determination to pursue<br />\na tragic theme to the logical conclusion than<br />\nto write a comedy or a romance. Romeo,<br />\nmight have received Friar Lawrence's message; Cordelia need not have hanged herself;<br />\nCassio could have explained all to Othello.<br />\nBut such were not the natural outcomes.<br />\nStevenson said \"Richard Feverel\" began to<br />\nend well, and then end badly. I do not<br />\nagree with him. There is a sense of inevitable<br />\ntragedy in the book. \u2022 The early chapters are<br />\nbright with the story of Richard's childhood<br />\nand youth, and the exquisite pictures of the<br />\nearly love of Lucy and Richard is comparable<br />\nBut with<br />\nto little out of Shakespeare.<br />\nvisit<br />\nto<br />\nLondon,<br />\nthe<br />\ntragic<br />\ntheme<br />\nRichard's<br />\nasserts itself. The ghastliness of Clare's<br />\nmarriage; the shoddy party at Richmond; the<br />\nbrilliant and terrible chapter called \"The<br />\nEnchantness\"; the scene by the dead body of<br />\nClare;\u2014all lead up to a definite tragic conclusion.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, other endings are imaginable.<br />\nThere is the flippant attitude which says,<br />\n\"Richard has atoned by remorse and distress<br />\nfor his sin; his ordeal is accomplished\u2014why<br />\nshould not he and Lucy live happily ever<br />\nafter ?\" The conventional novelist might<br />\nhave arranged a more obvious and more nearly<br />\njust conclusion. As his punishment, Richard<br />\nwould have died from the wound received in<br />\nthe duel. But Meredith's is the master-hand.<br />\ntucy dies from brain-fever, brought on by<br />\nanxiety over Richard's illness. Richard lives.<br />\nLucy dies when her husband is recovering,<br />\nwhen Sir Austin is reconciled to her, when<br />\nshe has everything to live for. The tragedy<br />\nis not in her dying, poor heart-weary soul !<br />\nbut in Richard's living. And as the supreme<br />\ntouch\u2014for Meredith has the courage to spare<br />\nnot his hand\u2014Richard, who had forsaken his<br />\nyoung wife when their honeymoon was<br />\nscarcely over, never sees her after her death,<br />\nof which he, still very ill, is informed only<br />\nafter her burial.<br />\nOn that lovely morning when they had first<br />\nmet, by the river, her parting is thus described:<br />\n\"He touched her hand, not moving his eyes<br />\nfrom her, nor speaking, and she, with a soft<br />\nword of farewell, passed across the stile,'and<br />\nup the pathway, through the dewy shades of<br />\nthe copse, and out of the arch of the light,<br />\naway from his eyes.\"<br />\nAnd the last words of the books are an<br />\necho of that first parting:<br />\n\"Have you noticed the expression in the<br />\neyes of blind men? That is how Richard looks,<br />\nas he lies there silent in his bed\u2014striving to<br />\nimage her on his brain.\"<br />\nThus the tragedy closes and, the words used<br />\nas a text by the preacher in \"Aylmer's Field\"<br />\nrise almost unsconsciously to our lips:<br />\n\"Behold,<br />\nYour house is left unto you desolate.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nMeredith is a writer irritating to read. He<br />\nis evasive, not only in his language, but in his<br />\nmethods of telling his tale. He is never<br />\nobvious, and the many \"strong\" situations<br />\nwhich the third-rate novelist would delight<br />\nin working out are left unnoticed by him.<br />\nThe development of such characters, the intro-<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nduction of such incidents, seem to be leading<br />\nup to a splendid chapter, brilliant in its repartee, intense in its feeling. But no. The<br />\nstory takes as it were a sudden turn to one<br />\nside. The characters do what would never<br />\nhave been expected, and yet the moment the<br />\naction is completed it is evident that such<br />\nwould have been the procedure in real life.<br />\n\"Strong scenes\" do not occur in every third<br />\nchapter of our lives; character, on the other<br />\nhand, is around us everywhere. It is as a<br />\nstudent and portrayer of character and human<br />\nnature that Meredith is remarkable. Not that<br />\nthere are not great and stirring scenes in the<br />\nnovels. If he evades a score of excellent<br />\n\"situations\" it is to bring all the characters<br />\ninto that exact relation, the one towards the<br />\nother, when our interest will be most<br />\nthoroughly aroused, our sympathies and<br />\nemotions best excited. Such a scene is that<br />\nbetween Darcier and Diana after her betrayal<br />\nof the State secret to the newspapers. It is a<br />\nwonderful scene, yet spoiled in a way by that<br />\nwilful excentricity of style, which has interferred so greatly with Meredith's popularity.<br />\nAnother such scene is the-chapter describing<br />\nthe third act of the opera Camilla. '`Vittoria,\"<br />\nin which this occurs, is-an historical novel<br />\ndealing with the revolution in Italy, and is<br />\nsingularly spirited and in contrast to \"Sandra<br />\nBelloni,\" of which it is a sequel, and which is<br />\nthe story of the love affair of a young Italian<br />\ngirl in England. The very naming of these<br />\nnovels, and the thought of others, is a temptation to write far beyond the limits which time<br />\nand space afford.<br />\nThere remains to point-out some characteristics in Meredith's work.<br />\nHe is thoroughly English. He is English<br />\nin his sympathy with the oppressed and with<br />\nthose who are struggling for liberty and better<br />\nthings. He is English in the highest sense of<br />\nthe word in his scorn of cant, sham, conventionality and hypocricy; and of that \"smug<br />\nmiddle-class morality,\" which will snicker<br />\ncovertly at indecency and cry shame at the<br />\nopen and honest exposure of such indecency.<br />\nHis characters, too, are English. They belong<br />\nto the great company which includes Falstaff<br />\nas well as Esmond, Tom Jones as well as<br />\nRavenswood.<br />\nMeredith's work is not exotic. He is no<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"literary freak.\" He is the product of his<br />\ntime. His work is the result of what has<br />\npreceeded him. He is the follower as well as<br />\nthe peer of Dickens and Thackeray. Their<br />\ninfluence is perceptible and at times obvious<br />\nin much of his early work. But since he was<br />\nno mere disciple but himself a master, after a<br />\nperiod of preparation he emancipated himself<br />\nfrom their discipleship.<br />\nA word must be said for the women in<br />\nhis stories. In the work of no English<br />\nnovelist is the character of women so carefully<br />\nstudied, so impartially judged, so accurately.<br />\nportrayed. It is a commonplace to mention<br />\nThackeray's \"mawkish\" good women; Helen,<br />\nAmelia and the rest, though such creations as<br />\nBecky Sharp are, of course, well nigh parallelless. Scott's heroines, even Diana Vernon,<br />\nare not always living, breathing women.<br />\nThey are parts of the romance in which they<br />\nmove. But Lucy in \"Richard Feverel!\"<br />\nHow perfectly her tender, loving and courageous nature is drawn. If she is the Miranda,<br />\nor perhaps Iniogen of the English novel,<br />\nDiana Warwick is the Portia, widow though<br />\nshe be.<br />\n' Meredith is moral. He is no prude. He<br />\nhas written strongly for strong minds, but he<br />\nhas always stood sturdily for things high and<br />\nof good report. One may be shocked, almost<br />\ndisgusted by the \"Enchantress\" in \"Richard<br />\nFeverel,\" but when the end comes our only<br />\nconsideration of the work from the moral<br />\nview-point is that the moral of such an end<br />\njustifies the means; that had the crime been<br />\nglossed over, the atonement would not have<br />\nbeen so impressive, the tragedy so real.<br />\nHe is sincere. In these post-Wilde days<br />\n\u2022 when we are in the hey-dey of the \"Sham and<br />\nSuper-sham\" of the \"Shavian philosophy,\"<br />\nsincerity in. the world of letters is not too<br />\ncommon. Meredith has himself believed what<br />\nhe has tried to win the world to believe. He<br />\nhas seen the smallness, the selfishness, the<br />\nnarrowness of individuals, but he has seen<br />\nthe nobility of human nature. With him life<br />\nis a struggle, but it is an upward struggle.<br />\nHis trust and belief is<br />\n\"that somehow good<br />\nWill be the final goal of ill.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe is an artist. Perhaps on no other score<br />\n<br />\nhas he been criticised so much as for the<br />\nobscurity and difficulty of his style. Yet<br />\nthat style is his own, and we are quick to recognize imitations of it. There is little<br />\nobscurity in \"Feverel;\" there is much in<br />\n\"Diana,\" and 'The Amazing Marriage\" is in<br />\nplaces almost incomprehensible. If Heywood<br />\nis a \"sort of prose Shakespeare,\" is not<br />\nMeredith, perhaps, a \"sort of prose Browning ?\" Both can be direct and forceful when<br />\nthey will; both frequently prefer to evade the<br />\nquestion, to hint at their meaning, to puzzle<br />\nand distract the reader. And yet Meredith is<br />\nan artist, because he has the artist's instinct<br />\nof not being satisfied with good work but<br />\nwishing for better, and aiming after it. Mr.<br />\nSwinburne, arrogant and superbly conceited<br />\nas ever, wrote lately that he had nothing to<br />\nregret, recant, alter, or unsay in any page he<br />\nhad ever laid before his reader. When we<br />\nconsider that hardly an edition of any of<br />\nMeredith's novels or poems has appeared<br />\nwithout his revision and supervision, that<br />\npassages have been cancelled and even characters blotted out, and new matter added<br />\nsince the first appearance of his works, does<br />\nnot the novelist come nearer our ideal of the<br />\nartist than the poet does? Whatever success<br />\nhe may have attained, whatever is to be the<br />\nimmortality of his fame, Meredith has courageously and conscientiously, against the advice of friends and in the face of discouragement and opposition, striven towards the goal<br />\nwhich he set himself to attain; in a word he<br />\nhas \"followed the gleam.\"<br />\nOne word more. As I said at the commencement of this paper, Meredith has been<br />\ncompared to Shakespeare. But glance over<br />\nthe long line of English writers. Who is able<br />\nto abide the frost of comparison with him?<br />\nAnd when one has read. Meredith and has<br />\nheard the calm exposition of his philosophy,<br />\nand has perceived the wealth of his characters and the discrimination in their drawing;<br />\nthe dramatic fervor and poetic imagination;<br />\nthe exquisite love-scenes and the terrors of<br />\ndeath\u2014when one has perceived all this, to<br />\nsay that he can for a moment be compared to<br />\nShakespeare augurs for the immortality of his<br />\nname and places on his brow<br />\n\"a truer crown<br />\nThan any wreath that man can weave hint.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE BANQUETS.<br />\nAS TOLD BY A JUNIOR.<br />\nIn the.last issue of the NEWS-LETTER we<br />\npromised to give a full account of the Class<br />\nBanquets. There is not much to be said<br />\nabout the Senior Banquet, for it went off in<br />\nthe customary quiet and stately manner which<br />\nis becoming to only Seniors.<br />\nThe Junior Banquet, however, caused a<br />\ngreat deal more excitement, not only on<br />\nThursday night, but also several days before.<br />\nOn Tuesday night it occurred to some of the<br />\nJuniors that it might be a good thing to<br />\ncapture the Freshmen President, and accordingly they stationed themselves 'around his<br />\nhouse. He was, however, too foxy for them,<br />\nand stayed out all night at a friend's house.<br />\nThe next day the President, supported by<br />\nseveral of his classmen very boldly came down<br />\nto the University with the sole intention of<br />\ncapturing some of the Juniors. They succeeded, for Mr. Bailey stepped off the car<br />\nright into their hands. He was hustled off to<br />\nthe country house of one of the Freshmen,<br />\nwhere he was safely guarded until the afternoon of the banquet. He was then released<br />\non the promise that he would stay only half<br />\nan hour at his banquet. The Freshmen also<br />\ncaptured Mr. Owens, the Junior Toastmaster,<br />\nbut as they were taking him into a house,<br />\nMr. Owens pushed one of his guards into a<br />\nsnow-bank and made his escape.<br />\nThe Juniors, in the meanwhile, had exacted<br />\npromises from many of the Freshmen that<br />\nthey would not attend any banquet that week.<br />\nThe most fun was had when Mr. Charles<br />\nTilghman and Mr. Houston resisted being<br />\ntaken. They put up a good fight, but the<br />\nodds wos so much against them that they<br />\nwere quickly bound. In this condition they<br />\nwere put in a carriage and driven in town to<br />\nthe Hotel Carrollton, where they were paroled<br />\nand given the freedom of the hotel. Mr.<br />\nClary was also retained under these conditions.<br />\nAt last the banquet was served, and every<br />\none was in high spirits. As was customary,<br />\nthe Seniors were given the privileges of the<br />\nJunior rooms at the hotel and of the banquet<br />\nhall. In other words, the Seniors, who were<br />\npresent, were there as guests of the Junior<br />\nclass. Everything was going well, the Seniors<br />\n<br />\ndrank toasts to the Juniors and in every way<br />\nappeared friendly, until after the fourth course<br />\nwas finished. The Seniors, who were now<br />\nstanding in the door- way to cover the entrance<br />\nof the Freshmen, jumped aside, and suddenly<br />\nwithout the slightest warning in rushed about<br />\ntwenty-five Freshmen. Some of the Freshmen, who were told by the Seniors that if<br />\nthey touched the captives they would be free,<br />\nmade a dash for their men; others went<br />\ndeliberately about upsetting tables and pulling<br />\noff the table-cloths in order to create as much<br />\ndamage as possible. This entire plan was<br />\ndevised by our supposed friends, the Seniors.<br />\nWe do not mean this to refer to the entire<br />\nSenior Class, but to only those Seniors who<br />\nwere present at the Junior Banquet. When<br />\nthe manager of the hotel stopped the Freshmen from coming in, the Seniors told him to<br />\nlet them in, as they belonged to the crowd<br />\nthat was there. Consequently, the unsuspecting manager calmly stood aside as the Freshmen went by. He was not long in discovering his error, for no sooner had the Freshmen<br />\nentered than every thing was in confusion.<br />\nIn about two minutes, however, the Freshmen<br />\nwere driven out, and vanished as quickly as<br />\nthey had come, and the banquet was continued with even more enjoyment than before.<br />\nThe Junior Class guaranteed the manager<br />\nof the hotel that all damages would be paid<br />\nfor. While the Junior Class has made this<br />\npromise, we think that the only square thing<br />\nto do, would be for the Freshmen Class to<br />\npay half the damages. This proposition was<br />\nmade by the President of the Freshmen Class<br />\nhimself. It is only right, too, that the<br />\nSeniors who were present, and who were the<br />\ncause of all this trouble, should pay their<br />\nshare, but this can not be expected of men<br />\nwho acted in the underhand manner in which<br />\nthey did.<br />\n4111MMININIM.<br />\n<br />\nMonday, February 17, 1908.<br />\n, what is 'em<br />\nGerman Prof.\u2014\"Mr.<br />\nFestessen' ?\"<br />\nStudent\u2014''A banquet.\"<br />\nClass laughs uproariously and yells of<br />\n\"Juniors, Juniors.\"<br />\nA.\u2014Why is a Class Banquet like a sleeping<br />\nbaby?<br />\nB.\u2014Because it's a case of kidnapping!<br />\n<br />\n\f\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n1:1<br />\nENJOYED T HEMS E LVF5<br />\n/fyq<br />\n<br />\nQuic7 WRY.<br />\n<br />\n1909<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS MEET.<br />\nAll the arrangements are progressing nicely<br />\nfor the Twelfth Annual Hopkins Meet, which<br />\nwill be held in the \"Cage\" on Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 29, and according to present indications the meet will be as successful as can<br />\nbe expected from the limited size of tha cage.<br />\nSeveral relay races have been arranged, the<br />\nchief one at present being that between<br />\nWestern Maryland and Delaware College.<br />\nMount Washington has entered a relay team,<br />\nbut its opponent has not yet been decided.<br />\nNegotiations are being made for several other<br />\nbig relays, and in addition to these there will<br />\nbe many races between the preparatory schools<br />\nand midget teams of this city and Washington.<br />\nThe event of the most interest to Hopkins<br />\nwill undoubtedly be the inter-class relay between the Junior and Freshman.teams. This<br />\nrace will be a close one, for the Freshmen<br />\nwill do everything in their power to wipe out<br />\nthe athletic defeats that they have sustained<br />\nat the hands of the Junirs. The Freshmen<br />\nteam will probably be composed of Stollenwerck, who ran a pretty quarter in the recent<br />\nFederal Meet; Burgan, who was a member of<br />\nthe two-mile team that defeated George<br />\nWashington University; Makle and Wolfe,<br />\nwho are both good men in the middle distances.<br />\nThe Juniors will be greatly handicapped by<br />\nthe loss of Gutman, one of the best quartermilers in the class, who will be ineligible, as<br />\nhe cannot came out for the track team. The<br />\nteam, nevertheless, will be strong, for Captain<br />\nBailey is in fine condition, and Wallace and<br />\nShneeburger have showed up well in recent<br />\ntrials. The fourth man on the Junior team<br />\nhas not yet been decided, but the choice will<br />\nprobably fall between Bond, Bird and Hopkins. It has been decided that it will be impossible to hold a tug-of-war, owing to the<br />\nlimited time of the meet.<br />\n<br />\nCOTRELL & LEONARD<br />\nALBANY, N.

That majority naturally feels in the<br />\nsame way as the other members of that class about recent \"events.\"<br />\nBut we must not forget\u2014as we are perhaps inclined to\u2014that the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER is \"published fortnightly by the Undergraduate<br />\nStudents of this University\" and we must represent the sentiments<br />\nnot only of the Junior Class, but of the Freshmen and Seniors.<br />\nEditorially therefore it is our place to \"congratulate\" the Freshmen<br />\nand to \"excuse\" their three or four friends in the Senior Class.<br />\nBut apart from Class rivalry it is high time that this business<br />\nck\" the Dean, or<br />\nshould come to an end. The editors of this paper are not trying to \"boot-li<br />\nof every gentlefeeling<br />\nthe<br />\nwith<br />\nand<br />\nany member of the Faculty.

But the poet, who died<br />\nheartbroken at the age of twenty-five, \"whose<br />\nname was writ in water\" is ranked today<br />\namong the first of English poets. Living he<br />\nwas \"obscurely illustrious;'' though not a<br />\nm ute,\" an 'inglorious Milton.\"<br />\nA writer in greater contrast to Keats, in<br />\nsome respects, than George Meredith, it<br />\nwould be hard to imagine. For many years<br />\n\u2014longer than the poet's life\u2014he, too, was<br />\namong the company of the \"obscurely illustrious,\" but more fortunate than Keats, he has<br />\nlived to deliver to England his full message,<br />\nhis full teaching and philosophy, and today<br />\non his eightieth birthday may justly claim the<br />\ntitle of greatest living English writer, the peer<br />\nof Fielding and of Richardson, of Scott, of<br />\nDickens and Thackeray.<br />\nSwinburne is the only living writer whose<br />\ngenius and achievement in literature rank<br />\nwith Meredith's. But their work is essentially<br />\ndifferent. Perhaps Swinburne's is the greater<br />\ngenius, but the truth of such a statement may<br />\nbe questioned. His gospel is the gospel of<br />\nregret, of longing for the past, of contempt<br />\nfor the present, of hopelessness for the future.<br />\nIn Meredith there is an wholesome humanity<br />\nand an ever-present optimism even in his<br />\ndarkest moments. He preaches a gospel of<br />\nprogress, not fanatical nor ideal, but sane,<br />\nsteady progress towards attainable ends. His<br />\nage has been in great measure out of sympathy<br />\nwith him; he has never been out of sympathy<br />\nwith his age.<br />\nThis lack of public interest in the work of<br />\nthe last of the Victorian novelists has been<br />\ntoo plainly manifested in a dense and almost<br />\nuniversal ignorance of his work. Until a few<br />\nyears ago many seemingly well-read people<br />\nhad never beard of him, or confused him<br />\nwith that able statesman and very second-rate<br />\n4<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\npoet \"Owen Meredith.\" As an instance of<br />\nthis ignorance, a man of sound education<br />\nasked lately if all of Meredith's novels were<br />\nin verse! But unacquainted as the general<br />\nmass of people have been with Meredith, to<br />\nthe highest classes and to the most sensitive<br />\nminds he has long strongly appealed. A<br />\nfortunate result of this is that excellent essays<br />\nand monographs\u2014both on his novels and<br />\npoetry\u2014are numerous. It will therefore be<br />\nentirely unnecessary to attempt a notice of<br />\nall his novels here. In a superficial sketch<br />\nsuch as this anything like an adequate appreciation of all his work would be impossible,<br />\nand anything less that such full treatment<br />\nwould be unfair to their author and unworthy<br />\nof the novels themselves.<br />\nGeorge Meredith is not only a novelist. He<br />\nwas first of all a poet\u2014the author of \"Love in<br />\nthe Valley,\" an Idyll which Tennyson loved.<br />\nHere that love and observance of nature<br />\nwhich is one of Meredith's strongest characteristics\u2014in common with our greatest poet<br />\n\u2014first evinces itself. A like \"morn in early<br />\nJune\" as that which must have inspired<br />\n\"Hark, hark! the lark\" is pictured for us in<br />\n'Love in the Valley.'<br />\n\"Happy happy time, when the white star hovers<br />\nLow over dim. fields fresh with bloomy dew, \u2022<br />\nNear the face of dawn, that draws athwart the darkness,<br />\nThreading it with colour, like yewberries the yew.<br />\nThicker crowd the shades as the grave East deepens<br />\nGlowing, and with crimson a long cloud swells.<br />\nMaiden still the morn is; and strange she is, and<br />\nsecret;<br />\nStrange her eyes; her cheeks are cold as cold seashells.\"<br /><br />\nThere is here an echo of Romeo's<br />\n\"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day,<br />\nStand tip-toe on the misty mountaid tops;\"<br /><br />\nand of the graver words of Horatio,<br />\n\"The morn, in russet mantle clad,<br />\nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\"<br /><br />\nIn his verse Meredith has not contented<br />\nhimself with depicting an idyllic love amidst<br />\nidyllic surroundings. As in his novels, he<br />\nhas not feared to treat of the darker and more<br />\nproblematical sides of existence. In 'Modern<br />\nLove,\" the greatest of his poems, fifty socalled 'sonnets\" contain the tragic history of<br />\na husband and a wife who through groundless<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\njealousy have slowly drifted apart until an<br />\nimpassable barrier has arisen between them.<br />\nParts of \"Modern Love\" rise to a superb<br />\nheight of mournful beauty; particularly, \"It<br />\nis the season of the sweet wild rose,\" \"He<br />\nfound her by the ocean's moaning verge,\"<br />\nand the poem which describes the hour of<br />\ntemporary reconciliation:<br />\n\"We saw the swallows gathering in the sky,<br />\nAnd in the osier-isle we heard their noise.<br />\nWe had not to look back on summer joys,<br />\nOr forward to a summer of bright dye:<br />\nBut in the largeness of the evening earth<br />\nOur spirits grew as we went side by side.<br />\nThe hour became her husband and my bride.<br />\nLove that had robbed us so, thus blessed our dearth!<br />\nThe pilgrims of the year waxed very loud<br />\nIn multitudinous chatterings, as the flood<br />\ngull brown came from the West, and like pale<br />\nblood<br />\nExpanded to the upper crimson cloud.<br />\nLove that had robbed us of immortal things<br />\nThis little moment mercifully gave,<br />\nWhere I have seen across the twilight wave<br />\nThe swan sail with her young beneath hbr wings.\"<br /><br />\nMeredith has written few real .sonnets, but<br />\nof those few one at least\u2014\"Lucifer in Starlight\" is worthy of mention. The fiend<br />\n\"tired of his dark dominion\" has escaped<br />\nfrom thence and has travelled uninterrupted<br />\nover the earth until he sees \"the stars that<br />\nstill sojourn, yet still move onward\" and then<br />\nhe sinks down to hell, overwhelmed by that<br />\nvisions of \"the army of unalterable law.\"<br />\nThis recognition of \"one law, one element\"<br />\nlinks Meredith to Tennyson. But there is a<br />\nstronger bond between him, and Wordsworth<br />\nand Tennyson,\u2014it is his love of nature.<br />\n\"The Woods of Westermain,\" the poems in<br />\n\"A Reading of Earth\" and many more are of<br />\na type like Wordsworth's and Tennyson's<br />\npoems of nature. Several critics have pointed<br />\nthis out, and one at least has said that were<br />\nhis expression worthy of his thought he would<br />\nbe comparable to Wordsworth and Tennyson.<br />\nIt is not as poet, but as novelist, however,<br />\nthat Meredith holds his position today.<br />\nHis life work has been devoted to comedy.<br />\nHe has even written an essay on the Comic<br />\nSpirit and an ode to it. But the comedy of<br />\nhis novels is not like \"Twelfth Night\" and<br />\n\"As You Like It,\" but \"The Alchemist\"<br />\nand \"The Silent Woman.\" Meredith, like<br />\nJonson, pictures for us the whims, the foibles,<br />\nthe \"humors\" of society. In his work, too,<br /><br />\nwe notice the influence of Moliere, there are<br />\nsuggestions of \"Les Femmes Savantes\" and<br />\n\"Tartuffe.\" There are traces, too, of the influence of the greatest English follower of<br />\nMoli\u20acre,\u2014there is at times the hard glitter of<br />\n\"Love for Love\" and \"The Way of the<br />\nWorld.\"<br />\n\"The Egoist, a comedy in narrative\" is<br />\ngenerally considered his greatest work;<br />\nStevenson thought it the greatest novel ever<br />\nwritten. \"Diana of the Crossways\" is probably his most popular story. \"Harry Richmond,\" in spite of the intricasy of the plot,<br />\nis the easiest to read. 'Beauchamp's Career,\"<br />\nwith its splendid attacks on sham and conventionality, has also, by some readers, been<br />\nthought his best work. All of them are<br />\namong the greatest novels in the language.<br />\nAll are subjected more or less to the power of<br />\nthe comic spirit. But it was in a tragic theme<br />\nthat Meredith attained his greatest height.<br />\nIn \"The Ordeal of Richard Feverel\" he told<br />\na striking and terrible story, expressed his<br />\nviews on life and his scorn of hypocracy,<br />\nexpounded his philosophy, 'pointed a moral\"<br />\nand moulded a tragedy which is appealing<br />\nand heart-rending pathos ranks with \"Lear\"<br />\nand \"The Bride of Lamermoor.\"<br />\nFew writers achieve a masterpiece; far<br />\nfewer a tragic masterpiece. It requires vastly<br />\nmore moral force and determination to pursue<br />\na tragic theme to the logical conclusion than<br />\nto write a comedy or a romance. Romeo,<br />\nmight have received Friar Lawrence's message; Cordelia need not have hanged herself;<br />\nCassio could have explained all to Othello.<br />\nBut such were not the natural outcomes.<br />\nStevenson said \"Richard Feverel\" began to<br />\nend well, and then end badly. I do not<br />\nagree with him. There is a sense of inevitable<br />\ntragedy in the book. \u2022 The early chapters are<br />\nbright with the story of Richard's childhood<br />\nand youth, and the exquisite pictures of the<br />\nearly love of Lucy and Richard is comparable<br />\nBut with<br />\nto little out of Shakespeare.<br />\nvisit<br />\nto<br />\nLondon,<br />\nthe<br />\ntragic<br />\ntheme<br />\nRichard's<br />\nasserts itself. The ghastliness of Clare's<br />\nmarriage; the shoddy party at Richmond; the<br />\nbrilliant and terrible chapter called \"The<br />\nEnchantness\"; the scene by the dead body of<br />\nClare;\u2014all lead up to a definite tragic conclusion.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nOf course, other endings are imaginable.<br />\nThere is the flippant attitude which says,<br />\n\"Richard has atoned by remorse and distress<br />\nfor his sin; his ordeal is accomplished\u2014why<br />\nshould not he and Lucy live happily ever<br />\nafter ?\" The conventional novelist might<br />\nhave arranged a more obvious and more nearly<br />\njust conclusion. As his punishment, Richard<br />\nwould have died from the wound received in<br />\nthe duel. But Meredith's is the master-hand.<br />\ntucy dies from brain-fever, brought on by<br />\nanxiety over Richard's illness. Richard lives.<br />\nLucy dies when her husband is recovering,<br />\nwhen Sir Austin is reconciled to her, when<br />\nshe has everything to live for. The tragedy<br />\nis not in her dying, poor heart-weary soul !<br />\nbut in Richard's living. And as the supreme<br />\ntouch\u2014for Meredith has the courage to spare<br />\nnot his hand\u2014Richard, who had forsaken his<br />\nyoung wife when their honeymoon was<br />\nscarcely over, never sees her after her death,<br />\nof which he, still very ill, is informed only<br />\nafter her burial.<br />\nOn that lovely morning when they had first<br />\nmet, by the river, her parting is thus described:<br />\n\"He touched her hand, not moving his eyes<br />\nfrom her, nor speaking, and she, with a soft<br />\nword of farewell, passed across the stile,'and<br />\nup the pathway, through the dewy shades of<br />\nthe copse, and out of the arch of the light,<br />\naway from his eyes.\"<br />\nAnd the last words of the books are an<br />\necho of that first parting:<br />\n\"Have you noticed the expression in the<br />\neyes of blind men? That is how Richard looks,<br />\nas he lies there silent in his bed\u2014striving to<br />\nimage her on his brain.\"<br />\nThus the tragedy closes and, the words used<br />\nas a text by the preacher in \"Aylmer's Field\"<br />\nrise almost unsconsciously to our lips:<br />\n\"Behold,<br />\nYour house is left unto you desolate.\"<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nMeredith is a writer irritating to read. He<br />\nis evasive, not only in his language, but in his<br />\nmethods of telling his tale. He is never<br />\nobvious, and the many \"strong\" situations<br />\nwhich the third-rate novelist would delight<br />\nin working out are left unnoticed by him.<br />\nThe development of such characters, the intro-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nduction of such incidents, seem to be leading<br />\nup to a splendid chapter, brilliant in its repartee, intense in its feeling. But no. The<br />\nstory takes as it were a sudden turn to one<br />\nside. The characters do what would never<br />\nhave been expected, and yet the moment the<br />\naction is completed it is evident that such<br />\nwould have been the procedure in real life.<br />\n\"Strong scenes\" do not occur in every third<br />\nchapter of our lives; character, on the other<br />\nhand, is around us everywhere. It is as a<br />\nstudent and portrayer of character and human<br />\nnature that Meredith is remarkable. Not that<br />\nthere are not great and stirring scenes in the<br />\nnovels. If he evades a score of excellent<br />\n\"situations\" it is to bring all the characters<br />\ninto that exact relation, the one towards the<br />\nother, when our interest will be most<br />\nthoroughly aroused, our sympathies and<br />\nemotions best excited. Such a scene is that<br />\nbetween Darcier and Diana after her betrayal<br />\nof the State secret to the newspapers. It is a<br />\nwonderful scene, yet spoiled in a way by that<br />\nwilful excentricity of style, which has interferred so greatly with Meredith's popularity.<br />\nAnother such scene is the-chapter describing<br />\nthe third act of the opera Camilla. '`Vittoria,\"<br />\nin which this occurs, is-an historical novel<br />\ndealing with the revolution in Italy, and is<br />\nsingularly spirited and in contrast to \"Sandra<br />\nBelloni,\" of which it is a sequel, and which is<br />\nthe story of the love affair of a young Italian<br />\ngirl in England. The very naming of these<br />\nnovels, and the thought of others, is a temptation to write far beyond the limits which time<br />\nand space afford.<br />\nThere remains to point-out some characteristics in Meredith's work.<br />\nHe is thoroughly English. He is English<br />\nin his sympathy with the oppressed and with<br />\nthose who are struggling for liberty and better<br />\nthings. He is English in the highest sense of<br />\nthe word in his scorn of cant, sham, conventionality and hypocricy; and of that \"smug<br />\nmiddle-class morality,\" which will snicker<br />\ncovertly at indecency and cry shame at the<br />\nopen and honest exposure of such indecency.<br />\nHis characters, too, are English. They belong<br />\nto the great company which includes Falstaff<br />\nas well as Esmond, Tom Jones as well as<br />\nRavenswood.<br />\nMeredith's work is not exotic. He is no<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"literary freak.\" He is the product of his<br />\ntime. His work is the result of what has<br />\npreceeded him. He is the follower as well as<br />\nthe peer of Dickens and Thackeray. Their<br />\ninfluence is perceptible and at times obvious<br />\nin much of his early work. But since he was<br />\nno mere disciple but himself a master, after a<br />\nperiod of preparation he emancipated himself<br />\nfrom their discipleship.<br />\nA word must be said for the women in<br />\nhis stories. In the work of no English<br />\nnovelist is the character of women so carefully<br />\nstudied, so impartially judged, so accurately.<br />\nportrayed. It is a commonplace to mention<br />\nThackeray's \"mawkish\" good women; Helen,<br />\nAmelia and the rest, though such creations as<br />\nBecky Sharp are, of course, well nigh parallelless. Scott's heroines, even Diana Vernon,<br />\nare not always living, breathing women.<br />\nThey are parts of the romance in which they<br />\nmove. But Lucy in \"Richard Feverel!\"<br />\nHow perfectly her tender, loving and courageous nature is drawn. If she is the Miranda,<br />\nor perhaps Iniogen of the English novel,<br />\nDiana Warwick is the Portia, widow though<br />\nshe be.<br />\n' Meredith is moral. He is no prude. He<br />\nhas written strongly for strong minds, but he<br />\nhas always stood sturdily for things high and<br />\nof good report. One may be shocked, almost<br />\ndisgusted by the \"Enchantress\" in \"Richard<br />\nFeverel,\" but when the end comes our only<br />\nconsideration of the work from the moral<br />\nview-point is that the moral of such an end<br />\njustifies the means; that had the crime been<br />\nglossed over, the atonement would not have<br />\nbeen so impressive, the tragedy so real.<br />\nHe is sincere. In these post-Wilde days<br />\n\u2022 when we are in the hey-dey of the \"Sham and<br />\nSuper-sham\" of the \"Shavian philosophy,\"<br />\nsincerity in. the world of letters is not too<br />\ncommon. Meredith has himself believed what<br />\nhe has tried to win the world to believe. He<br />\nhas seen the smallness, the selfishness, the<br />\nnarrowness of individuals, but he has seen<br />\nthe nobility of human nature. With him life<br />\nis a struggle, but it is an upward struggle.<br />\nHis trust and belief is<br />\n\"that somehow good<br />\nWill be the final goal of ill.\"<br /><br />\nHe is an artist. Perhaps on no other score<br /><br />\nhas he been criticised so much as for the<br />\nobscurity and difficulty of his style. Yet<br />\nthat style is his own, and we are quick to recognize imitations of it. There is little<br />\nobscurity in \"Feverel;\" there is much in<br />\n\"Diana,\" and 'The Amazing Marriage\" is in<br />\nplaces almost incomprehensible. If Heywood<br />\nis a \"sort of prose Shakespeare,\" is not<br />\nMeredith, perhaps, a \"sort of prose Browning ?\" Both can be direct and forceful when<br />\nthey will; both frequently prefer to evade the<br />\nquestion, to hint at their meaning, to puzzle<br />\nand distract the reader. And yet Meredith is<br />\nan artist, because he has the artist's instinct<br />\nof not being satisfied with good work but<br />\nwishing for better, and aiming after it. Mr.<br />\nSwinburne, arrogant and superbly conceited<br />\nas ever, wrote lately that he had nothing to<br />\nregret, recant, alter, or unsay in any page he<br />\nhad ever laid before his reader. When we<br />\nconsider that hardly an edition of any of<br />\nMeredith's novels or poems has appeared<br />\nwithout his revision and supervision, that<br />\npassages have been cancelled and even characters blotted out, and new matter added<br />\nsince the first appearance of his works, does<br />\nnot the novelist come nearer our ideal of the<br />\nartist than the poet does? Whatever success<br />\nhe may have attained, whatever is to be the<br />\nimmortality of his fame, Meredith has courageously and conscientiously, against the advice of friends and in the face of discouragement and opposition, striven towards the goal<br />\nwhich he set himself to attain; in a word he<br />\nhas \"followed the gleam.\"<br />\nOne word more. As I said at the commencement of this paper, Meredith has been<br />\ncompared to Shakespeare. But glance over<br />\nthe long line of English writers. Who is able<br />\nto abide the frost of comparison with him?<br />\nAnd when one has read. Meredith and has<br />\nheard the calm exposition of his philosophy,<br />\nand has perceived the wealth of his characters and the discrimination in their drawing;<br />\nthe dramatic fervor and poetic imagination;<br />\nthe exquisite love-scenes and the terrors of<br />\ndeath\u2014when one has perceived all this, to<br />\nsay that he can for a moment be compared to<br />\nShakespeare augurs for the immortality of his<br />\nname and places on his brow<br />\n\"a truer crown<br />\nThan any wreath that man can weave hint.\"<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE BANQUETS.<br />\nAS TOLD BY A JUNIOR.<br />\nIn the.last issue of the NEWS-LETTER we<br />\npromised to give a full account of the Class<br />\nBanquets. There is not much to be said<br />\nabout the Senior Banquet, for it went off in<br />\nthe customary quiet and stately manner which<br />\nis becoming to only Seniors.<br />\nThe Junior Banquet, however, caused a<br />\ngreat deal more excitement, not only on<br />\nThursday night, but also several days before.<br />\nOn Tuesday night it occurred to some of the<br />\nJuniors that it might be a good thing to<br />\ncapture the Freshmen President, and accordingly they stationed themselves 'around his<br />\nhouse. He was, however, too foxy for them,<br />\nand stayed out all night at a friend's house.<br />\nThe next day the President, supported by<br />\nseveral of his classmen very boldly came down<br />\nto the University with the sole intention of<br />\ncapturing some of the Juniors. They succeeded, for Mr. Bailey stepped off the car<br />\nright into their hands. He was hustled off to<br />\nthe country house of one of the Freshmen,<br />\nwhere he was safely guarded until the afternoon of the banquet. He was then released<br />\non the promise that he would stay only half<br />\nan hour at his banquet. The Freshmen also<br />\ncaptured Mr. Owens, the Junior Toastmaster,<br />\nbut as they were taking him into a house,<br />\nMr. Owens pushed one of his guards into a<br />\nsnow-bank and made his escape.<br />\nThe Juniors, in the meanwhile, had exacted<br />\npromises from many of the Freshmen that<br />\nthey would not attend any banquet that week.<br />\nThe most fun was had when Mr. Charles<br />\nTilghman and Mr. Houston resisted being<br />\ntaken. They put up a good fight, but the<br />\nodds wos so much against them that they<br />\nwere quickly bound. In this condition they<br />\nwere put in a carriage and driven in town to<br />\nthe Hotel Carrollton, where they were paroled<br />\nand given the freedom of the hotel. Mr.<br />\nClary was also retained under these conditions.<br />\nAt last the banquet was served, and every<br />\none was in high spirits. As was customary,<br />\nthe Seniors were given the privileges of the<br />\nJunior rooms at the hotel and of the banquet<br />\nhall. In other words, the Seniors, who were<br />\npresent, were there as guests of the Junior<br />\nclass. Everything was going well, the Seniors<br /><br />\ndrank toasts to the Juniors and in every way<br />\nappeared friendly, until after the fourth course<br />\nwas finished. The Seniors, who were now<br />\nstanding in the door- way to cover the entrance<br />\nof the Freshmen, jumped aside, and suddenly<br />\nwithout the slightest warning in rushed about<br />\ntwenty-five Freshmen. Some of the Freshmen, who were told by the Seniors that if<br />\nthey touched the captives they would be free,<br />\nmade a dash for their men; others went<br />\ndeliberately about upsetting tables and pulling<br />\noff the table-cloths in order to create as much<br />\ndamage as possible. This entire plan was<br />\ndevised by our supposed friends, the Seniors.<br />\nWe do not mean this to refer to the entire<br />\nSenior Class, but to only those Seniors who<br />\nwere present at the Junior Banquet. When<br />\nthe manager of the hotel stopped the Freshmen from coming in, the Seniors told him to<br />\nlet them in, as they belonged to the crowd<br />\nthat was there. Consequently, the unsuspecting manager calmly stood aside as the Freshmen went by. He was not long in discovering his error, for no sooner had the Freshmen<br />\nentered than every thing was in confusion.<br />\nIn about two minutes, however, the Freshmen<br />\nwere driven out, and vanished as quickly as<br />\nthey had come, and the banquet was continued with even more enjoyment than before.<br />\nThe Junior Class guaranteed the manager<br />\nof the hotel that all damages would be paid<br />\nfor. While the Junior Class has made this<br />\npromise, we think that the only square thing<br />\nto do, would be for the Freshmen Class to<br />\npay half the damages. This proposition was<br />\nmade by the President of the Freshmen Class<br />\nhimself. It is only right, too, that the<br />\nSeniors who were present, and who were the<br />\ncause of all this trouble, should pay their<br />\nshare, but this can not be expected of men<br />\nwho acted in the underhand manner in which<br />\nthey did.<br />\n4111MMININIM.<br /><br />\nMonday, February 17, 1908.<br />\n, what is 'em<br />\nGerman Prof.\u2014\"Mr.<br />\nFestessen' ?\"<br />\nStudent\u2014''A banquet.\"<br />\nClass laughs uproariously and yells of<br />\n\"Juniors, Juniors.\"<br />\nA.\u2014Why is a Class Banquet like a sleeping<br />\nbaby?<br />\nB.\u2014Because it's a case of kidnapping!<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n1:1<br />\nENJOYED T HEMS E LVF5<br />\n/fyq<br /><br />\nQuic7 WRY.<br /><br />\n1909<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS MEET.<br />\nAll the arrangements are progressing nicely<br />\nfor the Twelfth Annual Hopkins Meet, which<br />\nwill be held in the \"Cage\" on Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 29, and according to present indications the meet will be as successful as can<br />\nbe expected from the limited size of tha cage.<br />\nSeveral relay races have been arranged, the<br />\nchief one at present being that between<br />\nWestern Maryland and Delaware College.<br />\nMount Washington has entered a relay team,<br />\nbut its opponent has not yet been decided.<br />\nNegotiations are being made for several other<br />\nbig relays, and in addition to these there will<br />\nbe many races between the preparatory schools<br />\nand midget teams of this city and Washington.<br />\nThe event of the most interest to Hopkins<br />\nwill undoubtedly be the inter-class relay between the Junior and Freshman.teams. This<br />\nrace will be a close one, for the Freshmen<br />\nwill do everything in their power to wipe out<br />\nthe athletic defeats that they have sustained<br />\nat the hands of the Junirs. The Freshmen<br />\nteam will probably be composed of Stollenwerck, who ran a pretty quarter in the recent<br />\nFederal Meet; Burgan, who was a member of<br />\nthe two-mile team that defeated George<br />\nWashington University; Makle and Wolfe,<br />\nwho are both good men in the middle distances.<br />\nThe Juniors will be greatly handicapped by<br />\nthe loss of Gutman, one of the best quartermilers in the class, who will be ineligible, as<br />\nhe cannot came out for the track team. The<br />\nteam, nevertheless, will be strong, for Captain<br />\nBailey is in fine condition, and Wallace and<br />\nShneeburger have showed up well in recent<br />\ntrials. The fourth man on the Junior team<br />\nhas not yet been decided, but the choice will<br />\nprobably fall between Bond, Bird and Hopkins. It has been decided that it will be impossible to hold a tug-of-war, owing to the<br />\nlimited time of the meet.<br /><br />\nCOTRELL &amp; LEONARD<br />\nALBANY, N.
