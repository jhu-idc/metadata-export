The<br />\nfollowing is a condensation of<br />\nseparate interviews with the<br />\nrespective candidates.<br />\nAmy Sandusky, a sophomore<br />\nbiology major from Johnstown,<br />\nPennsylvania, has served on the<br />\nCouncil for two years. As a student liaison for the English as a<br />\nSecond Language program, she<br />\nhas attended and participated in<br />\nclasses designed to help foreign<br />\nteaching assistants learn the<br />\nlanguage as well as American<br />\ncollege student slang. She has<br />\nalso sat on a number of ad hoc<br />\ncommittees, most notably the<br />\nArmstrong Committee, which<br />\nshe feels is increasing open communication between students and<br />\nthe Administration. As a result of<br />\nthese experiences, one of her<br />\nmain campaign planks is open<br />\ncommunication<br />\non<br />\nthe<br />\nHomewood campus: \"I feel that<br />\ngood, open communication starts<br />\n<br />\nin the classroom and extends well<br />\nbeyond.

Finally, there could be<br />\nsome student input on important<br />\nUniversity decisions. What I<br />\nthink is more ridiculous is the<br />\n50% tuition hike for summer<br />\nschool intro-level science<br />\ncourses. When the University<br />\ntries to make a profit from the<br />\nsummer school to put into Arts<br />\nand Sciences and other schools,<br />\nits thoughts are in the right direction, but 50% is too stiff.

McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: the scrapheap.<br />\nI have tons of work to do, and<br />\nI really don't have time to write<br />\na thematically sound column, so<br />\nthis week's installment will consist of all those ideas that I'd really like to develop into complete<br />\ncolumns, but can't for whatever<br />\nreason.<br />\nI guess thematically, we could<br />\ncall it \"Those Aspects of Human<br />\nExistence that Chris Finds Most<br />\nPeculiar.\"<br />\nOne of the most peculiar<br />\nthings, for me, at least, is the fact<br />\nthat facial tissue is about four<br />\ntimes the size of bathroom<br />\ntissue\u2014and twice as thick. Consider this: you get an eight-inch<br />\nby eight-inch four-ply square for<br />\nyour nose (the biggest honker requiring maybe ten square inches<br />\nat most) but you get a four-byfour one-ply square, albeit a<br />\nrough ply most of the time, for<br />\nyour derriere (I won't speculate<br />\non what size the largest tush<br />\nmight need).<br />\nNumber two: snarfing. It is<br />\nsaid that in some countries, it is<br />\ncommon courtesy to belch after<br />\na good meal, and most<br />\nAmericans, I think, would find<br />\nthat gross. By the same token,<br />\nhowever, I have found that many<br />\nAmericans consider it a tremendous achievement if they can get<br />\none of their close friends to snarf<br />\nat a meal, an achievement worthy of countless anecdotal repetitions to those other close friends<br />\nwho might have missed the event.<br />\nEditor's Note to those Belching<br />\nVisitors to Our Fine Country<br />\nWho Might Not Know What the<br />\nVerb \"To Snarf\" Means, Let<br />\nAlone How to Conjugate It: It is<br />\nan odd fact of the human anatomy<br />\nthat when faced with possible<br />\nasphyxiation by combining<br />\nlaughter with commonly imbibed fluids, the brain has the ability to register the embarassment<br />\nfactor of said fluid in the event of<br />\ndeath (i.e. it is much cooler to die<br />\n\"choking violently on a dry martini\" than to die \"gagging,<br />\nmoustache-laden, on 2% milk.\").<br />\n<br />\nGiven that a particular drink is<br />\njust too hysterical to let somebody<br />\ndie on, the brain will cause a sudden and jarring peristaltic twitch,<br />\nforcing said drink back up,<br />\nhopefully, through the mouth. In<br />\nthe event that this mouth is not<br />\nbusy laughing, the result will be<br />\na \"saliva tocarum,\" more commonly called a \"spit take.\" If the<br />\nmouth is laughing, however, the<br />\ntongue will be pressed against the<br />\nesophagus, and the drink will be<br />\nforced out another egress, namely, the nose. The passage from<br />\nesophagus to nose is an intricate<br />\none, filled with many organs<br />\ndesigned to transform ordinary<br />\nfood into mucous-based lifeforms. The emergence of these<br />\nlife-forms is \"snarfing.\"<br />\nThird, of course, is elevatorbutton-punching, best illustrated<br />\nthusly: Person approaches<br />\nElevator. Person pushes \"up\"<br />\nbutton, thus alerting Elevator of<br />\nhis/her presence. Elevator, on<br />\nanother floor, may take ten or<br />\ntwelve seconds to arrive. Person,<br />\nangered that Elevator was not<br />\nnotified earlier of his arrival,<br />\nstrikes on the notion that perhaps<br />\npressing the \"up\" button 9,000<br />\nmore times will make it arrive<br />\nfaster. This act is usually coupled with a glance up at the ceiling<br />\nin order that Person, capable of<br />\nvision through solids, might<br />\nwatch Elevator's hurried approach. This activity was what<br />\nprompted me to submit the<br />\nStupidity Bill to Congress, in<br />\norder to mandate a \"Slap Law.\"<br />\nThe \"Slap Law\" gives<br />\npedestrians the rights and responsibilities of deputies when acts of<br />\nstupidity are witnessed. A<br />\npedestrian witnessing someone in<br />\nfront of an elevator, for example,<br />\ntapping the drum solo to<br />\n\"Wipeout\" on the call button<br />\nwith head upturned, would have<br />\nthe duty of stopping the person<br />\nimmediately and slapping him or<br />\nher across the face, winning<br />\nanother battle in the war against<br />\nstupidity.<br />\nSee PUNCH, 7<br />\n<br />\nwould like to begin a weekly \"Cartoon\" section.

Make sure<br />\nto pick up your News-Letter Lacrosse Preview at Hoppy<br />\nHour and around campus.<br />\n<br />\nFor the first time, I feel sufficiently incensed to write to the<br />\nNews-Letter, thanks to Mr. Dick<br />\nOles.<br />\nHis attitude, while I'm sure<br />\nhe'd consider it well-thought-out,<br />\nscreams self-contradiction. He<br />\ncorrectly,(though not originally),<br />\npointed out the hypocrisy of an<br />\nadministration which permits the<br />\nshowing of pornographic films,<br />\nwhile it thrills in taking action<br />\nagainst what was construed as a<br />\nsexist cartoon in The Spectator.<br />\n(And yes, Mr. Oles, some<br />\nwomen do size up men in that<br />\nway. Everyone sizes up others<br />\n\"in their own way.\" How else is<br />\none to decide if one is attracted<br />\nto another, physically or intellectually? I fail to see the brilliance<br />\nof your point.) He also repeated<br />\nthe apparent irony of a newspaper<br />\nrun by liberals practicing censorship/editorial prerogative, depending on your point of view.<br />\nAgain, very original. He also attacks people who label anyone<br />\nwho disagrees with them \"racist\"<br />\nor \"sexist\". His first mistake is<br />\nin not realizing that those are not<br />\ntrue liberals. His second mistake<br />\nis in not realizing that he appears<br />\nto exhibit a characterisitic similar<br />\nto the radicals he attacks: labeling anyone who annoys him a<br />\n\"liberal:'<br />\nClearly, Mr. Oles, you lack<br />\noriginality and abound in, yes,<br />\nclosed-mindedness. Your obvious<br />\ndisgust for the \"liberal mind\"<br />\nleads to your all-too-eager indictment of liberals as \"thoughtcontrol police!' I, sir, am a<br />\nliberal. I also, believe it or not,<br />\nabhor the characteristic of refusing to entertain varying points of<br />\nview, seeing one way as the only and right way.

As stated several times, the<br />\ngroup of students who went to the<br />\nadministration went on their own<br />\nbehalf, and not as representatives<br />\nof the Women's Center. This<br />\nrepresents a positive trend in the<br />\nattitude of the student body, that<br />\nindividuals would feel strongly<br />\nenough about something that affected them personally to do<br />\nsomething about it, and that they<br />\nwould feel comfortable enough to<br />\ngo to an administrator and voice<br />\ntheir concerns.<br />\nThe Women's Center sent out<br />\na flyer asking the Hopkins community if they thought this cartoon was appropriate, and we<br />\nstand behind this action. The flyer<br />\nwas offensive only to the extent<br />\nthat the cartoon was offensive,<br />\nbut at least in the context of the<br />\nflyer the attitude was questioned,<br />\nrather than accepted.<br />\nThe members of the Women's<br />\nCenter are dismayed to find that<br />\ninstead of addressing the issue of<br />\nsexism that this cartoon presents,<br />\nthis campus has successfully<br />\nthrown up a smoke screen in the<br />\nguise of the censorship issue.<br />\nFocusing the argument on censorship is convenient in that no one<br />\nis threatened, except perhaps the<br />\neditors of campus publications.<br />\nThe fact is that many people are<br />\nuncomfortable discussing issues<br />\nof discrimination because of the<br />\nbasic reality that in order to provide equality, the dominating<br />\ngroup will have to relinquish<br />\nsome of its precious control.<br />\nWhether we are referring to an<br />\nAryan race or a patriarchy, those<br />\nwho dominate will try to avoid<br />\ndiscussing the issue.<br />\nThe issue here is sexism, and<br />\nit is so pervasive and omnipresent<br />\nthat we have trouble identifying<br />\nit as such, much less addressing<br />\nit constructively in the form of<br />\ndialogue within this intellectual<br />\ncommunity. If this strip had<br />\ntargeted any other minority group<br />\non campus, it would not have<br />\n<br />\nbeen printed.<br />\nEvidently there was another<br />\ncartoon by the same artist submitted to the Spectator, but because<br />\nof space restrictions it was not<br />\nprinted. The alternative strip<br />\npresented an issue similar to the<br />\none in the printed cartoon, but it<br />\nwas aimed at the men of Johns<br />\nHopkins instead of the women.<br />\nThe editors of the Spectator chose<br />\nthe cartoon that they found to be<br />\nthe most humorous. Obviously it<br />\nis funnier, or more accepted, to<br />\nmock women than men.<br />\nThe cartoon itself was meant to<br />\noffend. The artist even told us to<br />\nwhom we should address hate<br />\nmail. We question the intent of<br />\nthis article. It seems that there<br />\nmust be more mature and meaningful ways to address the issue<br />\nof sexism, if dialogue among the<br />\ncommunity is truly the intent. The<br />\nidea that women should be judged by their looks rather than their<br />\nintelligence is blatantly sexist and<br />\ndiscriminatory. Threatened by intelligent women, some people attempt to diminish their worth by<br />\nusing the media's argument that<br />\na woman's value is determinined by her looks. Seemingly innocent remarks or jokes such as this<br />\nare the most pervasive forms of<br />\ndiscrimination today. By unconsciously accepting these views<br />\nwe reinforce our learned biases.<br />\nBy laughing at African<br />\nAmericans, Jews, Puerto Ricans,<br />\nhomosexuals, and women we are<br />\nsubordinating these groups. We<br />\nhope that any future discussion of<br />\nthe \"2x +1\" article will focus on<br />\nthe real issue at hand.<br />\nFinally, the Women's Center's<br />\nprimary goal is not to accuse. We<br />\nare a resource center for anyone<br />\ninterested in women's issues.<br />\nMarch is International Women's<br />\n,Month and we will be sponsoring several events to celebrate<br />\nwomen's solidarity.

One would imagine that<br />\neveryone would want to receive<br />\ndeclining installments. That way<br />\nyou could invest the surplus<br />\nsalary and earn interest on it for<br />\nsix years.

Mr. Yoon, at the recent candidates forum, made the<br />\ncomment that he felt the problems<br />\nof racism and sexism were not an<br />\nissue on this campus, and that it<br />\nis not the role of Student Council to deal with such issues unless<br />\nspecific problems arose. Mr.<br />\nYoon further stated that he felt<br />\n<br />\ndiscussion of such issues would<br />\nonly heighten any tensions which<br />\nmight exist on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nI must adamantly reply that I<br />\nfeel Mr. Yoon is misguided in his<br />\nbeliefs. Racism, sexism, and for<br />\nthat matter elitism are a serious<br />\nproblem on this campus. I must<br />\nwonder if Mr. Yoon has had his<br />\neyes and ears open during his<br />\nyears here at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nMustvents be dramatically conducted and flagrantly paraded in<br />\nthe face of fellow students for<br />\nsome to take notice? Much goes<br />\non beneath the surface at this<br />\nUniversity which is often brushed over in a \"feel-good\" manner.<br />\nThis cannot be allowed to continue. I applaud the efforts of<br />\nanother presidential candidate for<br />\nhis ideas to make the problems of<br />\nracism, sexism, and elitism an<br />\nopen issue in this campaign. I further congratulate this candidate<br />\nfor his innovative idea to include<br />\na member of Dr. Francine<br />\nAshby's Student Committee on<br />\nEthno-Violence (which holds its<br />\nfirst meeting today) as a nonvoting advisory member to student council.<br />\nAs a current Housemaster, I<br />\nmust say that all of us at the Office of Residential Life have<br />\nworked hard to educate the<br />\nfreshman class to the various evils<br />\nof the three isms. I am shocked<br />\nand appalled that a current<br />\nmember of Student Council<br />\nwould state that such issues are<br />\nnot the role of student government members to deal with. I<br />\ncannot believe that many of his<br />\ncolleagues feel this way. I would<br />\nremind Mr. Yoon that student<br />\ncouncil should exist as a place for<br />\nleaders who wish to bring a<br />\npositive vision of student life here<br />\nat Hopkins to fruition. Thus,<br />\nworking with student organizations such as BSA, JSA, GALA,<br />\nand the Women's Center to promote a greater sense of<br />\nunderstanding is imperative.<br />\nFailure to confront serious issues<br />\nwhich seek to divide the student<br />\nbody and threaten an overall environment of enlightenment must<br />\nbe viewed as extremely<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nI must state that Mr. Yoon<br />\nprefaced his remarks with the<br />\ncomment that his views were probably not going to be popular.<br />\n<br />\nincome for the time that you<br />\nworked. What did the survey<br />\nfind? An overwhelming 76 percent of the respondents wanted<br />\ntheir wages to increase. Even<br />\nafter they were given an explanation of the advantages behind<br />\ndecreasing installments, 69 percent still went for the increasing<br />\nscale. Economic theorists should<br />\nbe taking notes.<br />\nThe same article describes the<br />\nphenomenon of consumer decisions. Suppose you are given the<br />\nchoice between two identical<br />\nrefridgerators. Brand X cost $800<br />\nto buys and uses $25 a year in<br />\nelectricity. Brand Y costs $700 to<br />\nbuy and uses $85 a year in electricity: The obvious choice is<br />\nBrand X. Even allowing for the<br />\ndevaluation of money, the more<br />\nexpensive refrigerator will save<br />\nthe purchaser about $200 over the<br />\ncourse of ten years. Yet people<br />\noften choose Brand Y. In other<br />\nwords, the value of $100 today<br />\n<br />\nis worth more to them than the<br />\nprospect of $300 in the future.<br />\nThis is not common sense, but it<br />\ndoes reflect the high personal discount rates that often affect consumer spending.<br />\nHow does all of this relate to<br />\nlarger economic issues? It certainly plays a role in the continued acceptance of deficit spending. People seem willing to bank<br />\non future prosperity. Historically low savings rates may be attributed to a country that has<br />\nbecome conditioned to living<br />\nbeyond its means. The fact that<br />\npeople are unable or unwilling to<br />\nexhibit sound economic behavior<br />\nhas a number of ramifications for<br />\npublic policy. Efforts to increase<br />\nsavings and investment require<br />\nprivate initiative. A person who<br />\npurchases \"Brand Y\" items will<br />\nbe unlikely to respond to a<br />\ngovernment tax rebate intended to<br />\nencourage savings. The solution<br />\nto this problem may be found in<br />\n<br />\nLETTERS, from 5<br />\nRush .<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn this campus of cynical and<br />\notherwise apathetic intellectuals,<br />\nit was refreshing to see the lively protest in honor of our President's visit last Thursday.

(It's<br />\npinned to the door.)<br />\nFIVE-YEAR PLAN<br />\nSome grad students have been<br />\nconcerned of late as to whether<br />\nthe GRO will get a chance to meet<br />\nthe new University President, Dr.<br />\nWilliam C. Richardson. Apparently, according to Joanne<br />\nHoulahan, this should be possible. Further, she said, her discussions as part of the Armstrong<br />\ncommittee had led her to believe<br />\nthat Richardson has a keen interest in revamping the teaching<br />\nof graduate students at Hopkins.<br />\nespecially with .a view to getting<br />\nPhD students, through quicker.<br />\nThis however brings one to the<br />\nproblem of what many perceive<br />\nde eartIS a trend towards man<br />\n<br />\nments' becoming little more than<br />\n\"service departments,\" meaning<br />\nthat they are concerned with<br />\nchurning out undergrads as<br />\nquickly as possible with little emphasis on new research. Departments that have particularly<br />\nsuffered, it is generally agreed,<br />\ninclude the language departments<br />\nand Biology. The latter used once<br />\nto require a lab for each class at<br />\nthe undergrad level. Now the<br />\nstudents can get away with taking only two lab classes for the<br />\nB.A., and they are only required<br />\nfro those taking classes to get into med school.<br />\nThis problem has been intensified by the five-year plan's enforcement of a ten percent cut in<br />\nfaculty numbers, to be acheived<br />\nthrough attrition. Thus important<br />\nvacancies may well remain unfilled. Certainly, they will not be<br />\nautomatically filled. As things<br />\nstand now, since the implementation of the plan, departments<br />\nwith recent vacancies must petition to have them filled. Arts &<br />\nSciences Dean Lloyd Armstrong<br />\ndecides each case on an ad hoc<br />\nbasis. To say the least, this would<br />\ncertainly seem to go against the<br />\ngrain of what incoming-president<br />\nRichardson is purported to want.<br />\nThe bind the school finds itself<br />\nin is simple. Undergrads provide<br />\nrevenue. Grads do not.<br />\nMoreover, some subjects are currently in high demand with<br />\nundergrads, such as International<br />\nRelations. The school is therefore<br />\npressure\u2014economic<br />\nunder<br />\npressure, if nothing else\u2014to let<br />\nundergrads into these majors in<br />\ngreater numbers as a way of increasing the cash flowing into<br />\nArts & Sciences. So far, so good.<br />\nThe problem lies in the fact that<br />\nHopkins' reputation is built on its<br />\nstatus as a research institution,<br />\nrather than a place of teaching.<br />\nHopkins always has been, and<br />\nstill is, a cross between a college<br />\nand a think-tank. But its name<br />\nrests on that think-tank component. However, other researchoriented establishments have far<br />\nlarger endowments than Hopkins<br />\nhas. We cannot afford not to<br />\nteach larger and larger numbers<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nof undergrads.<br />\nAnd yet we don't cio a particularly good job of it. For this<br />\ncomes at a time when many professors are trying to shed some of<br />\ntheir advising responsibility due<br />\nto the amount of research time it<br />\ncuts into. Since 1975, there has<br />\nbeen a staggering 70 percent drop<br />\nin the proportion of undergrads<br />\ntaking the honors option, which<br />\nincludes for the most part an individually supervised senior<br />\nthesis. On top of this, the Office<br />\nof Acedemic Advising, which<br />\ndoes an excellent job under the<br />\nmost adverse of circumstances, is<br />\nencouraging students to rely on<br />\ntheir own departments' council,<br />\nrather than the less specific advice<br />\noffered by Academic Advising.<br />\nIn some departments, it has<br />\nbecome common for advising<br />\nresponsibilities to be given over<br />\nto grad students; the profs no<br />\nlonger have the time.<br />\nAll of which puts more<br />\npressure on the long-suffering<br />\ngrad population. Smaller<br />\nstipends, because of financial<br />\ncuts. Greater teaching\u2014and now,<br />\nadvising\u2014loads, because of the<br />\nten-percent cut in faculty. Wayda<br />\ngo, Steve.<br />\nThe cumulative result will<br />\nsimply be that Hopkins' name<br />\nplummets still further. Grad<br />\nstudents must no longer be taken<br />\nfor granted. Hopkins must either<br />\ncontinue to let grads in at the current fairly high rate, while<br />\nguaranteeing them enough funding to get through their programs quickly, without having to<br />\nresort to teaching and outside jobs<br />\nto support themselves. Or it must<br />\ndrastically reduce the number of<br />\ngrads admitted, while agreeing to<br />\nfund them for longer as each grad<br />\nsoaks up an inevitably larger<br />\nteaching load.<br />\nEither path will do. The current<br />\none will not.

This program was co-sponsored by the<br />\nWomen's Studies Program and<br />\nthe Ford Foundation.<br />\nThe seminar drew a small<br />\ncrowd, about forty people, and<br />\nwas well-received. Mary Poovey,<br />\nco-ordinator of the seminar,<br />\nstated that abortion would be \"the<br />\npolitical issue of the 1990's,\"<br />\nespecially after the 1989 Supreme<br />\nCourt Case of Webster v.<br />\nReproductive Health Services.<br />\n<br />\nIn their decision on this issue,<br />\nthe court chose to give individual<br />\nstates the right to legislate and reject the rights of women to have<br />\nabortions. It showed an \"interest<br />\nin prenatal life at .the risk of<br />\nwomen's bodies,\" and has led to<br />\nchanges in the abortion policies<br />\nof many individual states.<br />\nAs co-ordinator of this<br />\nseminar, Ms. Poovey introduced<br />\nthree speakers who spoke on the<br />\nrepercussions of the Supreme<br />\nCourt's decision. The speakers<br />\nwere Professor Sylvia Law, of<br />\nthe NYU Law School, Professor<br />\nFaye Ginsberg, NYU Department of Anthropology, and Jean-<br />\n<br />\nnie I. Rosoff, from the Alan Guftmacher Institute. After the three<br />\nlectures concluded, a round-table<br />\ndiscussion was held with the three<br />\nspeakers as well as with Ms.<br />\nPoovey and Connie Nathanson<br />\nand Lorna Thorpe, two members<br />\nof the. Hopkins community.<br />\nProfessor Sylvia Law's lecture<br />\nwas the most Interesting of the<br />\nthree. Law worked as a historian<br />\nfor the case of Webster v.<br />\nReproductive Health Services,<br />\nresearching the history of abortion in the United States. She<br />\nchose to work on this case<br />\nbecause she knew that a loss<br />\nwould give states \"very broad<br />\n<br />\n11011111ftwor<br />\n<br />\n4111111111111111111<br />\n<br />\nMichael Blumhardt<br />\n<br />\nStudents ponder the meaning of life and art.<br />\n<br />\nrights to limit women's rights\"<br />\nin situations such as abortions.<br />\nShe worked as part of a group of<br />\nlawyers\u2014\"all women\"\u2014to<br />\nprepare information for the court<br />\non the history of abortion. Such<br />\ninformation could prove valuable<br />\nto the court's decisions not only<br />\nin the Webster case, but also in<br />\nfuture cases involving abortion.<br />\nThe pro-choice historical team<br />\nhad two main goals. First, they<br />\nhoped to \"prevent the stupid use<br />\nof history,\" as it was being<br />\npresented by the pro-life coalition. This goal was successful, as<br />\nno mention of history was made<br />\nin the final write-up of the case.<br />\nThe second, more ambitious<br />\ngoal, was to \"tell the truth\" about<br />\nthe history of abortion. This was<br />\nmore difficult, as the history of<br />\nsuch is hard to trace in a manner<br />\nsuitable for use with the prochoice argument. For most of<br />\nhistory, abortions were not illegal, but rather a part of the<br />\nsocial practices and beliefs of the<br />\nordinary people.<br />\nThe cases against abortion<br />\nthroughout history focus around<br />\ndiscrimation ag .inst women and<br />\nthe attempts of men to \"keep<br />\nwomen in their place.\" Law<br />\npoints out, however, that in today's society such an argument<br />\nwould be declared both sexist and<br />\nunconstitutional. She asserts that<br />\nit is not right to use the<br />\n\"discrimination against women<br />\nhistorically as justification for its<br />\ncontinuance.\"<br />\nInstead, the pro-life movement<br />\nhas argued for the \"rights of the<br />\nfetus,\" the unborn child. This<br />\njustification is not found<br />\nhistorically, and most likely arose<br />\n\"in part as a surrogate for other<br />\nmotivations that ate no longer<br />\nconstitutionally or socially acceptable,\" such as the right of men<br />\nto keep women in their place.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nAs Professor Law researched<br />\nthe history of this volatile issue,<br />\nshe discovered that abortion was<br />\nactually more common in the<br />\nnineteenth century than it is today. In 1871, for instance, when<br />\nNew York City had a population<br />\nof under one million, there were<br />\nover two hundred full-time abortion clinics in operation, not including doctors who would perform the operation as part of<br />\ngeneral practices. This number is<br />\nmore than that of clinics in NYC<br />\nduring 1990.<br />\nFitting such information into<br />\nher final report for the court was<br />\ndifficult, Prof. Law admits. She<br />\nadmits that there is an \"inherent<br />\ntension between truth-telling and<br />\nadvocacy,\" and that advocacy<br />\ncan often lead to a \"distortion of<br />\ntruth.\" This was hard to guard<br />\nagainst and sometimes led to the<br />\ninability to use certain informa-<br />\n<br />\ntion in .her brief.<br />\nOne such case concerned the<br />\nhistory of abortion at the time of<br />\nthe founding fathers. It was said<br />\nto be \"quite common and widely acceptable.\" Further research,<br />\nhowever, proved that there was<br />\nlittle background for such statement. So, in the final draft, it was<br />\nonly possible for Prof. Law to say<br />\nthat abortion was \"known and not<br />\nillegal\" during that time period.<br />\nSuch in-depth research seems<br />\nto have played an important role<br />\nin the Supreme Court's decision<br />\nlast year. Still, Prof. Law feels<br />\nthat we \"can't be optimistic\"<br />\nabout the court continuing to<br />\nallow abortions legally in the<br />\nUnited States. Such a determination is likely to be made within<br />\nthis decade, as the issue of abortion continues to be, as Ms.<br />\nPoovey stated, \"catapulted to the<br />\nforefront of political activity.\"<br />\n<br />\nNORTHWESTERN<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\n<br />\nSUMMER<br />\nPOSITIONS<br />\nAVAILABLE<br />\nSummer Residential Counseling for the<br />\nCollege Preparation Program<br />\n\u2022Assist 50 high school juniors enrolled in<br />\nsummer session to have a full and successful<br />\nexperience with higher education.<br />\n\u2022 Live and study on the Lake Michigan shores for<br />\nthe summer of 1990.<br />\n'Compensation: summer room and board,<br />\nsalary and expenses, one course tuition<br />\nscholarship.<br />\nFor complete job description and application<br />\ninformation, call Elaine Hirschhorn at<br />\n1-800-FINDS NU.<br />\n<br />\n\"Pre-teen Sex is Teleology\" and<br />\nother creations at Art Showcase<br />\nple told me it was pretty good.

It weighs<br />\nin at two hours and ten minutes<br />\nand, in less time than that,<br />\ntransforms an entertaining work<br />\nof fiction into an exercise in<br />\nwaterlogged boredom.<br />\nYet even as the filmmakers<br />\nfalter, \"Red October\" still<br />\namazes with the sheer ingenuity<br />\nof its plot. Soviet submarine Captain Marko Alexandrovich<br />\nRamius (Sean Connery) violates<br />\nmilitary orders and sends his<br />\nsuper-advanced nuclear submarine hurtling toward friendly<br />\nAmerican ports.<br />\nWhile the United States<br />\nmilitary sweats under the threat<br />\n<br />\nof imminent nuclear attack, CIA<br />\nanalyst Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin)<br />\nrealizes that what Ramius is in<br />\nfact trying to defect from the<br />\nSoviet Union. Complicated twists<br />\nensue: Ryan tries to convince his<br />\nown milirAry not to annihilate<br />\nRamius wbile the Soviets track<br />\nRed October to ensure that its<br />\ntechnology doesn't fall into<br />\nAmerican hands.<br />\n\"Red October\" weaves<br />\ntogether dozens of other minor<br />\nand major players. The action<br />\ndashes from the October to<br />\nvarious tracking ships (Soviet and<br />\nAmerican), and then to brief<br />\nstops at the Kremlin and the National Security Council. The<br />\ndense story here probably<br />\ncouldn't be told any other way,<br />\nbut these curt, constant changes<br />\noften grind the film's events to an<br />\nexcruciatingly slow pace. The<br />\n<br />\nfilm audience (unlike a read<br />\ncan't turn back the pages to<br />\nfingure out what's going on, so<br />\nevery point in \"Red October\" is<br />\n.<br />\nmade very clear.<br />\nIn this instance, clarity leads to<br />\nsimplicity, and \"Red October\"<br />\nadopts a view of international<br />\npolitics that is laughable in scope<br />\nand dangerously distorted. Policy<br />\ndeliberations degenerate into sitcom side shows, and the United<br />\nStates government is run by savvy slickers who pull fast ones<br />\nover on their dimwitted Soviet<br />\ncounterparts.<br />\nIt would be wrong to reveal the<br />\nfilm's ending, but it doesn't take<br />\nan audience of rocket scientists to<br />\nfigure it out. \"Red October\" may<br />\nbe set before perestroika, but that<br />\ndoesn't stop a few good Russians<br />\nfrom admitting the sins of their<br />\nways and kneeling before the<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nby Paul Bonanos<br />\nMUSIC<br />\nPianist Joel Wizansky will be<br />\nplaying Beethoven's \"Piano Concerto No. 1\" at Shriver Hall Sunday at 3 p.m. Subsequently, the<br />\nHopkins Symphony Orchestra<br />\nwill be playing Hanson's \"Symphony No. 2 ( 'Romantic' ).\"<br />\nThe HSO will be conducted by<br />\nHarvey Selder.

Opening with<br />\n\"Deep Fascination\" from their<br />\n1988 \"Only Life\" LP, the band<br />\n<br />\nblistered its way through a<br />\nfifteen-song set of originals and<br />\ncovers. Their trademark,<br />\ninstantly identifiable sound,<br />\ncharacterized by strong twoguitar interplay and winding feedback leads over brittle electric<br />\nstrumming, highlighted impressive renditions of \"Loveless<br />\nLove,\" from 1980's scarce<br />\n\"Crazy Rhythms\" album , and<br />\n\"Higher Ground,\" from \"Only<br />\nLife.\"<br />\nBut it was \"Slipping (into<br />\nsomething),\" a 1986 original<br />\nmusically reminiscent of the<br />\nVevet Underground's \"Heroin,\"<br />\nthat truly ignited the set. Building<br />\nfrom a quiet, simple riff over<br />\nsome spare percussion from<br />\ndrummers Stanley Demeski and<br />\nDave Weckerman, a sudden acceleration brought the song to its<br />\n<br />\nMOVIES<br />\n<br />\n'Hunt for Red October'<br />\nPractically Begs to Be<br />\nPut out of Its Misery<br />\nMOVIES, from 8<br />\nstoicism are intended to belie a<br />\nmonumental struggle, mano a<br />\nmano. But this is like<br />\nforeshadowing with a hammer.<br />\nBaldwin is credible, but Connery's talent is wasted. He is<br />\nneither glorified nor pathetic; he<br />\njust drifts somewhere in between.<br />\nAnd the inevitable meeting between the two doesn't arrive until the film practically begs to be<br />\nput out of its misery.<br />\nThere isn't a whiff of humanity in \"Red October.\" Ramius<br />\nshies from every attempt to enunciate his reasons for defecting;<br />\nand out of a cast of nearly a hun-,<br />\ndred, there are only three<br />\nfemales. Ryan is only with his<br />\nwife when she is reminding him<br />\nnot to miss his plane; his daughter<br />\nseems roughly as important to<br />\nhim as the stuffed animal she<br />\nsporadically clutches. What re-<br />\n<br />\nfrenzied climax, with guitarists<br />\nBill Million and Glenn Mercer<br />\nstrumming with such furious intenstity that strings were breaking left and right. This was<br />\nfollowed by the brilliant almosthit \"Away,\" which received<br />\nenough college radio airplay to be<br />\nrecognized by neophyte fans. A<br />\ncover of the Rolling Stones'<br />\n\"Paint It, Black\" also incited<br />\nsome unwelcome but thankfully<br />\nnon-violent slamdancing in the<br />\ngeneral admission crowd.<br />\nAs if the excitement had not<br />\nbeen enough, a rendition of<br />\n\"Crazy Rhythms,\" with Million<br />\nand Mercer joining in spirited<br />\nharmonies, and an overwhelming<br />\nstop-start cover of Neil Young's<br />\n\"Sedan Delivery\" ended the set.<br />\nA series of encores followed, including \"I'm A Believer\" and the<br />\nBeatles' White Album chestnut<br />\n\"Everybody's Got Something To<br />\nHide Except Me and My<br />\nMonkey.\" At this point percussionist Dave Weckerman went to<br />\nthe stage's front and tapped out<br />\nrhythms on a suspended metal<br />\nbar. When the bar fell midway<br />\n<br />\nThis week at The<br />\n<br />\nthrough the song and hung from<br />\nits stand by just a single strand of<br />\nwire, Weckerman valiantly dropped to his knees to continue,<br />\nsmacking the bar against a wall<br />\nfor some unique sound effects.<br />\nThe Feelies further revealed some<br />\nof their musical influences with<br />\na supercharged cover of the<br />\nVelvet Underground's \"What<br />\nGoes On,\" as Glenn Mercer's<br />\nenergetic Lou Reed-like singing<br />\nand Bill Million's ringing rhytm<br />\nguitar powered the song to its<br />\nend.<br />\nAs the band packed up after the<br />\nshow, they welcomed fans onto<br />\nthe stage, discussing everything<br />\nfrom downtown clubs to drum<br />\ncymbals. Asked if another album<br />\nwas due to be released soon,<br />\ndrummer Stan Demeski said,<br />\n\"Not too soon.. we toured a lot<br />\nafter [\"Only Life\"]; we're taking our time.\" Many fans were<br />\nimpressed by the band's terse wit<br />\nand surprising accessibility.

AIDS, the demand for a<br />\nbetter health care system, and the<br />\ndevelopment of new technology<br />\nhas placed a heavy burden on the<br />\nAmerican pocketbook. Physicians practice with fear of being<br />\nsued for malpractice and the<br />\nmany potential physicians decide<br />\nto pursue a career demanding less<br />\ntime and money.<br />\nIn the January 18, 1990 issue<br />\nof the New England Journal of<br />\nMedicine, Timothy Johnson,<br />\nmedical journalist for ABC<br />\nNews, wrote two articles that expressed his concern for the<br />\nprofession.<br />\nmedical<br />\nthat<br />\nbelieves<br />\nHe<br />\nchanging medicine from a<br />\nbusiness profession back into a<br />\nmedical<br />\nprofession<br />\nwill<br />\nameliorate the lack of trust between doctors and their patients.<br />\nBelow are excerpts from his<br />\nletters.<br />\n\"Dear Medical Consumers:<br />\n. . . Some practitioners had<br />\ntaken advantage of the enormous<br />\nfreedom and power of a physician's licence to practice with arrogance and charge with greed.<br />\nIt was therefore inevitable that the<br />\npublic\u2014through its representatives, the politicians\u2014would<br />\nreact to the highly visible excesses of physicians who took advantage of a system in which the<br />\ndoctor was supreme and could<br />\n<br />\n\"Today, young<br />\ndoctors often<br />\nreach the end of<br />\ntheir training with<br />\na debt of $50,000<br />\nto $100,000...\"<br />\nliterally write his own ticket . . .<br />\n\"Today, young doctors often<br />\nreach the end of their training<br />\nwith a debt of $50,000 to<br />\n$100,000 that they must pay out<br />\nof relatively low earnings. They<br />\nface a professional life that includes a public and lawyers eager<br />\nto sue, administrators in the<br />\npublic and private sectors eager<br />\nto control, and worst of all, patients eager to be suspicious of<br />\ntheir doctor's ability and<br />\nmotivation.<br />\n\"Many doctors have told me<br />\nthat when a new patient walks in<br />\nthe door, their first thoughts are<br />\ndirected not to finding out what<br />\nis wrong and how to help but<br />\nrather to wondering whether this<br />\nis another patient likely to bring<br />\nsuit.<br />\n\"Please do not misunderstand<br />\nmy purpose in alerting you to the<br />\nanxiety that is developing among<br />\ndoctors. Any profession with<br />\npower over our lives requires<br />\nsensible monitoring and public<br />\nscrutiny . .. But if we go so far<br />\nas to make our physicians sick at<br />\nheart, we do ourselves no favor<br />\nwhen the time comes for us to<br />\nseek their help.\"<br />\n\"Dear Doctors:<br />\nDoctors, of course, have good<br />\nreasons to expect high incomes:<br />\nthe long and arduous training, the<br />\nemotional and physical demands<br />\nof practice, the value of the services offered. But medical consumers, although able intellectually to acknowledge such<br />\narguments, find it hard to accept<br />\nthat they should pay for<br />\nsomething they did not want or<br />\nthat anyone should make large<br />\nprofits from their misery.<br />\n\"Therefore, I have come to<br />\nbelieve that for the medical profession to preserve the public<br />\ntrust, it is critical for doctors to<br />\nbe studious and scrupulous in<br />\navoiding any and all financial<br />\nconflicts of interest. I believe that<br />\nwe should henceforth be encouraging the development of<br />\nnongovernmental practice arrangements based on salaries for<br />\nphysicians, rather than fees.<br />\n\"The financial environment<br />\n<br />\nshould consist of a salary well<br />\nabove the national average [from<br />\n$90,000 to $100,000 starting<br />\nsalaries with opportunities to advance to $200,000. And for those<br />\nwho believe that doctors should<br />\nhave the right to make much<br />\nmore, like some business executives they know, I would<br />\nsimply suggest that they go into<br />\nbusiness]. I would also argue that<br />\nthe salaries in all specialities<br />\nshould be very similar, with<br />\nvariation allowed only to account<br />\nfor cost-of-living factors, number<br />\nof hours worked (especially at<br />\nnight and on weekends), and<br />\nother differences in effort. This<br />\nshould allow doctors to choose<br />\nspecialties purely for reasons of<br />\ninterest and suitability, not<br />\nbecause of financial incentives. I<br />\nwould also stress the critical importance of eliminating financial<br />\nincentives from the opposite<br />\ndirection, such as placing of<br />\npressure on doctors to save<br />\nmoney by doing less for patients<br />\nthan medical judgment would<br />\notherwise dictate. Finally, we<br />\nshould include building in incentives for patients to avoid unnecessary risks or demands.\"<br />\nThe publication of these two<br />\nletters sparked many comments<br />\nfrom the medical community.<br />\nNorman Anderson, chairman of<br />\nadmissions at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Medicine, found the article to be too superficial. \"What<br />\ndoes Dr. Johnson want this country to do? He wants everybody to<br />\nguarantee doctors honor and<br />\ntrust, almost an open debit drawing on the checkbook from society, giving every doctor a<br />\nsizeable salary. He believes that<br />\nthis in itself will solve the problem of society.<br />\n\"He's failing to address a<br />\nmuch broader issue: the structure<br />\nof the health system, the burdens<br />\nOf where we are in dealing with<br />\nInequities of physician distributions, inequities of distributions<br />\nof specialties and sub-specialties<br />\ncare.<br />\n'The American Medical<br />\nAssociation has also done studies<br />\nto show that doctors' earnings<br />\nhave gone down in the past<br />\nseveral years. Health care costs<br />\ncontinue to rise, unresponsive to<br />\ninflation or anything else. The<br />\nreasons, by in large, are the administrative bureaucratic components that have nothing to do<br />\nwith taking care of the sick, but<br />\nare the billing, the re-billing, the<br />\nauditing, the validation, the oversight of the procedure. They have<br />\nclear evidence there is already<br />\nthis tremendous bureaucracy of<br />\nnon-workers who are really adding to the cost of today's health<br />\ncare.\"<br />\nAll the physicians I interviewed agreed that an improved health<br />\ncare system is of utmost importance. Most of them do not<br />\nbelieve the government is doing<br />\nenough to alleviate the financial<br />\nburden that the American people<br />\nwill have to shoulder in the near<br />\nfuture.<br />\nThis concern and many others<br />\nwere.addressed on February 11,<br />\n1990, at a symposium held at the<br />\nGlass Pavilion. Topics such as<br />\n\"Sustaining Ethical Values in<br />\nMarket Place Medicine,\"<br />\n\"Health Care Dilemmas in the<br />\nThird World,\" and \"The Impact<br />\nof Social Problems Upon Doctors\" provided a basis in which<br />\nthe public can see what change<br />\nhas taken place in the field of<br />\nmedicine. One physician commented that a doctor these days<br />\nhas two responsibilities: one to<br />\nheal the sick and the other to<br />\ndirect the government into providing a system and financial support that will benefit the health of<br />\nAmericans.<br />\nIt is then not a wonder that<br />\nmany students these days have<br />\nturned away from the field of<br />\nmedicine. Many have turned<br />\naway from medicine because they<br />\nbelieve it not worth the years of<br />\narduous training and the enormous debt when they are done.<br />\nJohn Gryder, pre-med auviser,<br />\nbelieves that \"many people in<br />\nmedicine have forgotten that it is<br />\na service profession. They are<br />\nlooking for monetary rewards and<br />\nthese types of people are not appropriate for a profession in<br />\n<br />\nwhich people expect them to<br />\nmake sacrifices.\"<br />\nReverend Clyde Shallenberger,<br />\none of the speakers at the medical<br />\nsympositim, concurred with<br />\nGryder's comment. \"If money is<br />\nthe primary motivation that drives<br />\na student to medicine, then the<br />\nworld is better off not having him<br />\nin medicine.\"<br />\nMany of the physicians including William Greenough, who<br />\nspent many years helping the<br />\nelderly in Bangladesh, and Jerry<br />\nReardon, who gave a speech concerning the social problems faced by doctors, believe the<br />\ndecrease in medical school applicants a positive change.<br />\nGreenough remarked, \"The<br />\ndecrease in medical applicants<br />\nwill extract the students who are<br />\nnot really right for the medical<br />\nprofession.\"<br />\nGryder spoke on the same lines<br />\nabout Hopkins' pre-meds: \"In all<br />\nhonesty, I.think the decrease in<br />\nthe number of applicants is good.<br />\nI see medical schools taking<br />\nstudents that they wouldn't have<br />\ntaken in the past because their<br />\ngrades weren't quite as high. You<br />\ndon't have to be a genius to be a<br />\ngood doctor. Getting 4.0 in<br />\nscience courses is not a requirement for medical school. Because<br />\nthe applicant pool is changing,<br />\n[admissions officers] are more<br />\ncareful in looking at other<br />\ncharacteristics. Because of this<br />\nthey are getting more students<br />\nthat are suitable for the profession.\"<br />\nAnother important question<br />\n<br />\nWELLNESS<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nNATIONAL COLLEGIATE DRUG AWARENESS<br />\nWEEK ACTIVITIES<br />\n<br />\nMONDAY, MARCH 5<br />\nKICK-OFF SPEAKER<br />\n<br />\nCAROLINE MILLER<br />\nauthor of<br />\n<br />\nMy Name Is Caroline<br />\nA graduate of Harvard, Caroline Miller will tell<br />\nof her seven years as a bulimic<br />\nand her recovery from addictions.<br />\nGLASS PAVILION<br />\n12 noon - 1 p.m.<br />\nRefreshments provided<br />\n<br />\n*******************************<br />\n<br />\nTUESDAY, MARCH 6<br />\nWELLNESS DAY<br />\nCARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENT<br />\n<br />\nAre you at risk for heart disease?<br />\nDo you know what your cholesterol level is<br />\nor<br />\nshould be?<br />\n<br />\n(cholesterol, blood pressure, stress,<br />\ncarbon dioxide screening)<br />\n<br />\nfor all<br />\nFACULTY, STAFF and STUDENTS<br />\nCost: $5.00<br />\nGLASS PAVILION<br />\n10 a.m. - 2 p.m.<br />\n<br />\n\"If money is the<br />\nprimary motivaCall 8271 for an assessment appointment (especially if<br />\nBe HEART SMART<br />\nneeded during the noon hour) or stop by the Class<br />\ntion that drives a<br />\nPavilion between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.<br />\nCosponsored by the Student Health Clinic.<br />\nstudent to<br />\nmedicine, then the<br />\nworld is better'off<br />\nnot having him in<br />\nmedicine.\"<br />\n*******************************<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\nposed at the symposium was<br />\nwhether American medical<br />\nschools are training students<br />\nenough to fit the needs of society. Gryder responded,\"I do have<br />\nsome problems with medical<br />\nschool training. There are a lot of<br />\ndifferent kinds of physicians that<br />\nare needed, and what we have<br />\ndeveloped is a single route for<br />\neverybody. I don't think it's<br />\npossible to clearly lay some common ground with such a wide<br />\nrange of specialties in medicine.<br />\nI really don't see why a<br />\npsychiatrist has to go through the<br />\nfour years that an oral surgeon<br />\ndoes. I also think that med<br />\nschools overemphasize the<br />\ntechnology and science of<br />\nmedicine and have not emphasized the human aspects to it<br />\nenough.\"<br />\nContrary to the pessimistic opinion of Timothy Johnson, many<br />\ndoctors believe that the American<br />\npublic still reveres the medical<br />\nfield. Reardon says, \"I think that<br />\nmany medical consumers still<br />\nhave an enormously positive attitude towards physicians.\" As<br />\none physician remarked, \"Those<br />\n[doctors] that have the three<br />\nJaguars in the driveway, et<br />\ncetera, et cetera, make the press,<br />\nbut the physicians who are in the<br />\ntrenches doing the important<br />\nwork, but not the kind of work<br />\nthat gives them a lot of popularity or even necessarily an excessive amount of income (i.e.<br />\ngoing to Bangladesh like Dr.<br />\nGreenbough, going to Nigeria<br />\nlike Dr. Henry Mosely), you<br />\ndon't read in the newspaper. I<br />\nthink that physicians have gotten<br />\nbad press, some of it deserved,<br />\nsome of it not deserved.\"<br />\nMany students believe<br />\nmedicine the route to a large<br />\nsalary, but there is much more to<br />\nmedicine. As Johnson writes,<br />\n\"Without good doctors to care<br />\nfor us, we medical comsumers<br />\ncould pay a terrible, even fatal<br />\nprice; without patients who trust<br />\nus, we doctors cannot hope for<br />\nwhat lured most of us into<br />\nmedical practice\u2014the experience<br />\nof helping sick people feel better.\"<br />\n<br />\nWheel of In<br />\nTest your knowledge!<br />\nWin a prize<br />\nFree Hot l'retzels<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nFree Balloons<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nHealthy Food Buffet<br />\n<br />\nPopcorn<br />\n<br />\nComputer Games<br />\nand<br />\nVideos<br />\n<br />\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 8<br />\nDRUG AWARENESS<br />\nDAY<br />\n11 a.m. - 2 p.m.<br />\nGLASS PAVILION<br />\nEXHIBITS -- FREE INFORMATION<br />\n<br />\nSUNDAY, MARCH 11<br />\n\"GETTING BY<br />\nWHILE<br />\nGETTING HIGH\"<br />\nGARRETT ROOM<br />\n<br />\n6:30 - 8 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nPanel discussion led by former students<br />\nrelating their experiences with addictions<br />\nduring their college days.<br />\nCosponsored by APT!' - Peer Counselors<br />\n<br />\n******************************<br />\nServices, 338-8396<br />\nJHU Substance Abuse Prevention Program-Office of the Dean of Homewood Schools<br />\nThe Faculty and Staff Assistance Program, 118 1648, 955-1220, 955-6534<br />\n<br />\n\f12/MARCH 2, 1990<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\nm<br />\na<br />\ng<br />\ny<br />\ne<br />\nn<br />\nr<br />\nu<br />\no<br />\nt<br />\nA<br />\nA<br />\nC<br />\nN<br />\nt<br />\n1s<br />\nn<br />\ni<br />\nw<br />\nJays<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\non<br />\nd<br />\nun<br />\nin<br />\nro<br />\nn<br />\nso<br />\nin<br />\nck<br />\nh<br />\nDi<br />\nig<br />\nle<br />\nir<br />\nFa<br />\ner<br />\nov<br />\nll<br />\nRo<br />\nby Lorin Engquist<br />\nJohns Hopkins received a bid to<br />\nthe NCAA Division III basketball<br />\ntournament and took advantage of<br />\nit with a 90-72 win over Farleigh<br />\nDickinson\u2014Madison, last night.

Eikenberg was able<br />\nto penetrate the defense at will<br />\nand dish off to his teammates for<br />\neasy jumpers. When reviewing<br />\nfilms of FDU, the Hopkins<br />\ncoaching staff noticed that the<br />\nDevils were lax in getting back<br />\non defense. The Jays took advantage, throwing long passes for<br />\nseveral easy layups early in the<br />\ngame. Hopkins.shot 62 percent in<br />\nthe first half and took a 44-36 lead<br />\nat the intermission.<br />\nFDU was plagued by turnovers, but was kept in the game<br />\nby center Gary Garvin. Garvin had<br />\n18 points at the half despite frequent double-teaming by the Jays.<br />\nFDU's big weakness was<br />\nballhandling, which wasn't<br />\nhelped by the loss of a starting<br />\nguard to injury.

While<br />\nmany Marylanders might think<br />\n\"lacrosse\" would be a better<br />\nanswer, jousting remains the<br />\nstate sport of Maryland,<br />\ndespite a recent attempt by<br />\nlacrosse advocates to give<br />\nlacrosse at least a share of<br />\njousting's title.<br />\nUnder pressure from State<br />\nSenate President Thomas<br />\n\"Mike\" Millc'. (D-Prince<br />\nGeorges County), supporters<br />\nof a bill proposing to designate<br />\nlacrosse the state team sport<br />\ndecided not to introduce it for<br />\nconsideration by the legislature<br />\nthis year. The bill, sponsored<br />\nby State Sen. Frank Kelly(DBaltimore County), would retain jousting as the state individual sport.<br />\nAccording to John Stude,<br />\none of the bill's chief supporters, Miller urged him and<br />\nKelly to wait until next year's<br />\nsession of the state legislature<br />\nto introduce the bill, due to the<br />\nlarge backlog of critical issues<br />\nfacing the legislature, such as<br />\ndrugs, education and the<br />\nbudget.<br />\nIn spite of this delay, Stude<br />\nremained undeterred. \"I'll<br />\nkeep proposing it until the day<br />\nI die,\" said Stude, who is<br />\npresident of Pridemaster Inc.,<br />\na Baltimore marketing and<br />\nadvertising firm, and whose<br />\nfather, Fritz Stude, played for<br />\nJohns Hopkins from 1928 to<br />\n1932.<br />\nBut this setback is only the<br />\nlatest in a series that lacrosse<br />\nand its devotees in Maryland<br />\nhave had to suffer since 1962,<br />\nwhen Gov. J. Millard Tawes<br />\nsigned a bill making jousting<br />\nMaryland's first state sport.<br />\nAlthough at that time lacrosse<br />\nwas already considerably<br />\npopular, Tawes claimed that<br />\nthe uniqueness of jousting<br />\nwould help spur tourists' interest in Maryland.<br />\nIfjousting had any effect on<br />\ntourism in Maryland is undocumented, but the years<br />\nsince then have seen interest in<br />\nlacrosse both in Maryland and<br />\nacross the nation increase<br />\ndramatically. Last year's<br />\nNCAA Division I men's<br />\nlacrosse championship game<br />\nbetween Johns Hopkins and<br />\nSyracuse drew 23,893 spectators to the University of<br />\nMaryland at College Park.<br />\nBut jousting supporters in<br />\nMaryland, made up of the approximately fifty members of<br />\n<br />\nthe Maryland Tournament<br />\nJousting Association, have<br />\nproved to be formidable opponents in the state government, although both Gov.<br />\nWilliam Donald Schaefer and<br />\nBaltimore Mayor Kurt<br />\nSchmoke played lacrosse at<br />\nCity College in Baltimore, and<br />\nthe latter also at Yale<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nAttempts to change the<br />\nnomenclature of the 1962 bill<br />\nby State Del. William J.<br />\nBurkhead (D-Anne Arundel<br />\nCounty) were voted down in<br />\nboth 1980 and 1982. More<br />\nrecently, a 1988 bill also sponsored by Kelly proposing to<br />\ncompletely replace jousting<br />\nwith lacrosse as the state sport<br />\nnever even received enough<br />\nvotes in a hearing by the House<br />\nConstitutional and Administrative Law Committee to<br />\nbecome introduced into the<br />\nlegislature.<br />\nOne of the reasons for the<br />\nstate government's opposition<br />\nto lacrosse is the conception a<br />\nlarge number of state<br />\nlegislators hold that lacrosse is<br />\nan excessively violent sport.<br />\n\"It's the closest thing to<br />\ncontrolled murder that I know<br />\nof,\" said Montgomery County Council President William<br />\nHanna in a Jan. 25 article in<br />\nthe Washington Post. Added<br />\nHanna, \"I never think of<br />\nMaryland as having anything<br />\nto do with lacrosse.\"<br />\nMany lacrosse supporters<br />\nfeel, however, that this is a<br />\n<br />\nmisrepresented and misinformed conception of lacrosse,<br />\nmost likely due to the advertisements for and image surrounding the Major Indoor<br />\nLacrosse League (MILL).<br />\nTeams in the MILL play box<br />\nlacrosse, a hybrid between<br />\nlacrosse and ice hockey, which<br />\nis promoted as being extremely<br />\nviolent.<br />\n\"I have a big beef against<br />\nthe whole sport because that is<br />\nthe one segment of lacrosse<br />\nthat is receiving some television time, airing time, advertising time, and all they show<br />\nare guys running into each<br />\nother . . . it's definitely different than field lacrosse,\"<br />\nsaid Johns Hopkins men's<br />\nlacrosse coach Don Zimmerman. \"And I in no way support or will ever support that<br />\nsport.\"<br />\nAnother reason for opposition from many state<br />\nlegislators to making lacrosse<br />\nthe state sport is the time and<br />\nmoney which must be spent by<br />\nthe state government in passing and putting into effect a bill<br />\nwhich, in the eyes of many,<br />\nhas no consequence.<br />\nLacrosse supporters respond, however, that if the state<br />\nhad time and money to make<br />\njousting the state sport in 1982,<br />\nit should have the time and<br />\nmoney in 1990 to also<br />\nrecognize lacrosse.<br />\n\"Issues which concern you<br />\nand me like drugs are definitely more important (than<br />\n<br />\nlacrosse], but this world goes<br />\naround largely because of<br />\nthings which 'really don't matter,\u2014 said Stude.<br />\nIn addition, the fact that<br />\nmore Maryland high school<br />\nstudents receive college<br />\nscholarships to play lacrosse<br />\nthan any other sport makes<br />\nlacrosse deserving of the state<br />\nsport designation in the eyes of<br />\nmany lacrosse supporters.<br />\n\"I don't think many of these<br />\nkids would be able to joust<br />\ntheir way to college,\" added<br />\nStude.<br />\nWhether or not lacrosse ever<br />\nreceives any form of the state<br />\nsport designation, its supporters feel it will continue to<br />\ngain in popularity and will<br />\nalways be their favorite sport.<br />\n\"I think it would be nice if<br />\nsomehow the state were to<br />\nsomehow recognize lacrosse as<br />\nthe state sport,\" said Zimmerman. \"But lacrosse is not a<br />\nprofessional game, and I think<br />\nthat because it's an amateur<br />\nsport it has retained some of<br />\nthe beauty of sport for sport.\"<br />\n\"The guys who come here<br />\n[to Hopkins] to play lacrosse,<br />\nthey know that they're not going to leave here and sign<br />\nmillion-dollar contracts to play<br />\nprofessional lacrosse,\" added<br />\nZimmerman. \"They play the<br />\nsport for the love of the game.<br />\nAnd to me, that's the essence<br />\nof sports.

However,<br />\nNYU destroyed Hopkins (14-2),<br />\na far cry from last season's tough<br />\n9-7 win.<br />\nThe women shined in the individual competition, placing two<br />\nfencers in the top six. Last<br />\nseason, Hopkins was shut out in<br />\nthe final round, placing no<br />\nfencers in the top six.<br />\nMen's Fencing<br />\nThe UAA Championships<br />\nresulted in a disappointing thirdplace finish for the second consecutive season for the Blue Jays.<br />\nHopkins (2-2) finished behind<br />\nNew York University (4-0) and<br />\nBrandeis (3-1).<br />\n<br />\nThe weekend started well with<br />\nthe fencers annihilating Case<br />\nWestern Reserve (23-4) in their<br />\nfirst match of the round-robin<br />\ncompetition. The epee squad<br />\nswept while the foil team faced<br />\nthe toughest fight, winning only<br />\n6-3.<br />\nIn round three, University of<br />\nChicago fell to Hopkins (20-7).<br />\nThe men's fencing tream was in<br />\ngood position after soundly<br />\ndefeating CWRU and Chicago, as<br />\nany ties were to be broken by<br />\ntotal number of bouts won.<br />\nJHU faced defending champion<br />\nBrandeis University in the fourth<br />\nround of the championships.<br />\nHopkins jumped out to a 7-2 lead<br />\nafter the first round. Untbrtunately, it was all downhill from there,<br />\nas Brandeis stormed back to<br />\nsqueeze out a 14-13 victory. This<br />\nleft both teams at 2-1 with JHU's<br />\nnext opponent being NYU (3-0).<br />\nEntering the NYU match,<br />\nHopkins still controlled its own<br />\ndestiny. With a win over NYU,<br />\nHopkins could claim the trophy,<br />\nbut only if they won by at least<br />\nthree bouts (15-12). If Hopkins<br />\nwon 14-13, they would<br />\nautomatically take second place.<br />\nHowever, with Brandeis facing a<br />\nweak Chicago squad in their final<br />\nmatch, Hopkins would probably<br />\nfall into third place with a loss to<br />\nNYU.<br />\nHopkins fell.

A competitive fall season,<br />\nfull of tryouts and challenge matches, produced a confident teen<br />\nof seven upperclassmen and four<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nDespite a losing season a year<br />\nago, senior captain Ryn Iwai<br />\npredicts a dramatic turnaround. In<br />\nmaking this prediction Ryn points<br />\nto several factors which will beg<br />\nfuture success. The only senior to<br />\ngraduate played number 2, and<br />\nwill be replaced at the top by<br />\nRyn, coming off an injury-filled<br />\nseason, and one of the best<br />\nfreshmen classes ever.<br />\nThe addition of new assistant<br />\ncoach Tom McCarthy, who<br />\nworks with top 20 player Jaime<br />\nYzaga, will add vigor and intensity to the team's workouts. After<br />\nthe first practice, McCarthy was<br />\nimpressed with the team's talents<br />\nand looks forward to a competitive and successful season.<br />\nThe tennis lineup is still in<br />\nquestion. Apart from Ryn playing number one, all the positions<br />\nare up in the air. Returning<br />\nplayers Lorin Enquist, last year's<br />\nnumber one player, South<br />\nAfrican Francois Erasmus, Sam<br />\nKim, Jon Missner, Ted Roth and<br />\nTony Sangchompuphen will battle freshmen Bill Braude, Jon<br />\nCohen, Chris Kwon, and Mike<br />\nKim for the remaining six spots<br />\non the traveling roster.<br />\nAfter the lineup begins to take<br />\nform, the team can really begin<br />\npreparations for its toughest<br />\nchallenges: Haverford, perennial<br />\npower Washington College, and<br />\nFranklin & Marshall.<br />\nThe team opens March 8th at<br />\nhome against Mary Washington<br />\nCollege.<br />\n<br />\nShould the Jays pull off the<br />\nupset tomorrow, they'll play the<br />\nwinner of Western Connecticut<br />\nand Trenton State University.<br />\nThose teams have combined<br />\nrecords of 47-6. However, it's<br />\nunlikely that the Jays will be looking past he Diplomats. F & M<br />\nhas a very efficient multi-option<br />\n<br />\nto earn F&M rematch<br />\n<br />\nmotion offense.<br />\n\"They're an excellent passing<br />\nteam,\" noted Jays assistant coach<br />\nEd Richardson. \"You really have<br />\nto see the ball well against them.<br />\nEach passer has three options,<br />\nand you never know what he's<br />\ngoing to do, so you can't cheat.<br />\nYou have to play honest or else<br />\nthey'll burn you.\" Apparently<br />\nthat is what happened the last time<br />\n<br />\nAfter losing to F & M, the .1'.iys<br />\nHopkins visited F & M.<br />\n\"We shot about 20 percent, we were 10-6 and faced an uphill<br />\ncouldn't pass, and we couldn't set climb to play in the post-srason.<br />\na pick. It was the worst game They had a team meeting in<br />\nwe've played since I've been which they discussed the role that<br />\nhere,\" said Enfield. \"We went . each player was expected to play.<br />\nin scared and we played scared,\" Since then the Jays are 8-1. \"We<br />\nsaid Jones. \"But we want this just gelled after that,\" said<br />\nEnfield.<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nEven should Hopkins lose, they<br />\ncan look back on a great season.<br />\n<br />\nFencers take 2nd,3rd<br />\nSTAB, from 13<br />\nfirst. That slim hope was dashed<br />\nimmediately as NYU won the<br />\nfirst two bouts of the round.<br />\nBrandeis defeated Chicago<br />\n(17-10), and a second-place finish<br />\nwas still possible, but only with<br />\na sweep of the final seven bouts.<br />\n<br />\nThis was not the Jays' day,<br />\nhowever, as they lost the next<br />\nbout. The final score was 17-10.<br />\nThe Blue Jays fared better in<br />\nthe individual competition. 10 of<br />\n12 Hopkins fencers qualified for<br />\nthe competition, with four<br />\nreaching the finals.

Next year, just<br />\ngetting into the playoffs is not going to be enough.

This<br />\nyear's team certainly left its mark<br />\non the history books.<br />\nWith no seniors graduating, the<br />\nentire team will be returning next<br />\nyear. Blank hopes that a good<br />\nrecruiting class will add even<br />\nmore depth to her team: \"We<br />\nneed more power inside, so we're<br />\nlooking to bring in a dominant<br />\npower forward/center. We would<br />\nalso like a backup point guard to<br />\ngive us more depth and help take<br />\nsome of the pressure off Juliane<br />\nand Tracy.\"<br />\nThe Jays could also be helped<br />\nby the return ofJen Luzietti, who<br />\nstarted at center before injuring<br />\nher knee early in the season.<br />\nLuzietti had reconstructive<br />\n<br />\nSaturday<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Swimming \u2022 Thursday<br />\n- Saturday<br />\n<br />\nsurvery on the knee and anticipates returning next year after<br />\nintense rehabilitation in the offseason. \"Jen is a steady, reliable<br />\nimpact player that can quietly hurt<br />\nan opponent,\" said Blank. \"We<br />\nhope to have her back next year.\"<br />\nThe Jays hope to open next<br />\nseason with their own four-team<br />\ntournament.

Special thanks to<br />\nall the News-Letter staff and<br />\nespecially to Mom and Dad.<br />\n<br />\nYouth is the key. Six of the<br />\nstarters from last year's<br />\nfinalists are gone. Four of<br />\nthem were All-Americans.<br />\nOne of them was Dave<br />\nPietramala. Pietramala was the<br />\nDivision I Player of the Year,<br />\nbut he was even better than<br />\nthat. Pietramala may well play<br />\nthe best lacrosse in the world.<br />\nEnter a new era for Blue Jay<br />\nlacrosse. Fourteen of the 39<br />\nplayers on the 1990 roster are<br />\nfreshmen. Eleven others have<br />\nvery limited game experience.<br />\nDon't call it a rebuilding<br />\nyear, though. Five Allto<br />\nreturn<br />\nAmericans<br />\nHomewood, including college<br />\nlacrosse's best goalie. The<br />\ntalent goes far beyond the five<br />\nand the potential for a trip to<br />\nRutgers on Memorial Day is<br />\ndefinitely there.<br />\n\"We're a younger team than<br />\nlast year overall, and less experienced,\" says Coach Don<br />\nZimmerman, who in this<br />\nseason of youth became a<br />\nfather on Tuesday morning.<br />\nYou could look at the team's<br />\nyouth as detrimental, but as far<br />\nas the enthusiasm they've<br />\nshown, they have more than<br />\n<br />\nmade up for the inexperience.<br />\nThat's what is going to carry<br />\nus through the first half of the<br />\nseason. Then we'll have experience and that will help us<br />\nthrough the rest.\"<br />\nGoal<br />\nCertainly the strongest<br />\naspect of the 1990 Jays is the<br />\nlast line of defense. Since he<br />\nemerged as a starter midway<br />\nthrough his freshman year, cocaptain Quint Kessenich has<br />\nbeen the nation's top<br />\ngoaltender. He has been a firstteam All-American the past<br />\ntwo seasons, and has continued<br />\nto improve throughout his<br />\ncareer. Now a senior, he appears prepared for his finest<br />\ncampaign. Kessenich has the<br />\nability to dominate a game. His<br />\nconfidence and outstanding<br />\njudgement would benefit any<br />\nteam, especially a young one<br />\nsuch as the Jays.<br />\nKessenich's responsibilities<br />\nhave changed this season,<br />\nthough, and he must prove his<br />\nability to respond to a new<br />\nrole. For his first three<br />\nseasons, Kessenich had the<br />\ntremendous luxury of playing<br />\n<br />\nbehind one of the greatest<br />\ndefensemen in the history of<br />\nthe sport. \"Dave was such a<br />\npresence,\" said Zimmerman,<br />\n'not just Quint, but anyone<br />\nwould miss having him out<br />\nthere.'<br />\nFrom covering the opponent's top offensive player to<br />\ncontaining fast breaks to<br />\nclears,<br />\nquarterbacking<br />\nPietramala led the Blue Jays on<br />\ntheir half of the field. Now,<br />\nto<br />\nlooks<br />\nZimmerman<br />\nKessenich to captain the<br />\ndefense, and Zimmerman<br />\nbelieves the senior is ready to<br />\nassume this leadership:In fact,<br />\nZim expects the responsibility to make Kessenich an even<br />\nmore dominant force.<br />\nseason,<br />\nthis<br />\nAgain<br />\nsophomores Scott Giardina<br />\nand Ian Hobbs will back up<br />\nKessenich.<br />\nClose Defense<br />\nNo team can lose Pietramala<br />\nand not suffer a drop in the<br />\nability of the close defense.<br />\nAdd the loss of Greg Lilly, a<br />\nsecond-team All-American<br />\ndespite missing half the season<br />\nwith a knee injury, and of<br />\n<br />\nCover photo by David Preece<br />\n<br />\n27th and Howard St.<br />\n467-7188<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE<br />\nPARTY<br />\nOne Free Keg<br />\nafter each home<br />\ngame!<br />\n3333 North Charles Street<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\n243-8844<br />\n<br />\n$2.00 off Pizza<br />\n<br />\nAny 16\" w/2 or<br />\nmore toppings.<br />\n<br />\n$1.00 off Pizza<br />\nAny 12\" w/2 or<br />\nmore toppings<br />\n<br />\n\fLACROSSE '90/3<br />\n<br />\nYouthful, potent team enters '90s<br />\nSteve Ciccarone, a top crease<br />\ndefenseman, and most teams<br />\nwould have rather low expectations for its defense. But<br />\nZimmerman feels confident,<br />\nand his optimism is realistic.<br />\nSenior co-captain James<br />\nAllDeTommaso, an<br />\nmiss1988<br />\nwho<br />\nAmerican in<br />\ned last year with a knee injury,<br />\nis back and at full strength.<br />\nLast season, when Lilly<br />\nwent down, Bill Dwan made<br />\nthe shift from defensive midfield to close defense well<br />\nenough to capture honorable<br />\nmention All-America recognition. Dwan begins this season<br />\non the close unit, and the expectations for the junior are<br />\neven higher. He has the potential to develop into the best<br />\ndefenseman in college<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nThe list of experienced close<br />\ndefenders ends there, leaving<br />\nthe need for someone to step<br />\nin at the third spot. \"Crease<br />\ndefense was one of our big<br />\nquestions,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\nThe answer appears to be<br />\nsophomore Nick Shevillo.<br />\n\"Nick set his sights on it in the<br />\nfall and worked hard at it. I'm<br />\n<br />\nvery pleased with his play. He<br />\nis one of our pleasant surprises,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\nMichael<br />\nFreshman<br />\nWohltmann, an alternate in last<br />\nseason's North-South High<br />\nSchool All-Star Game, will be<br />\nthe first close defenseman off<br />\nthe bench.<br />\n<br />\nreduction in long sticks,<br />\nDefensive Midfield<br />\nJuniors Brian Voelker and McNealey has switched to<br />\nJamie McNealey return to lead short-stick rope, a position<br />\na potent rope unit.

The third<br />\ncollege ranks. Because of the member of last year's rope,<br />\n<br />\nPat Russell, has graduated,<br />\nand two capable freshmen,<br />\nSteve McMahon and Tom<br />\nSullivan, have become the<br />\nfront-runners for his shortstick spot. Rob Burke, also a<br />\nfreshman, will spell Voelker at<br />\nlong-stick when needed.<br />\nRounding out the defensive<br />\ntroops are senior Dave<br />\nHowland, junior Ross Henshaw, and freshman Allen<br />\nWatts. Howland missed last<br />\nseason with knee problems and<br />\nis still on the road to recovery.<br />\n\"He's in a feeling-out process<br />\nof what he can do and what he<br />\ncan't do,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\n\"It's hard to come back from<br />\na knee injury. He needs time<br />\nto gain confidence with the injury.\" If able to return to<br />\nprevious form, Howland could<br />\nmake a significant contribution<br />\nto the team.

Will Syracuse win a<br />\nthird consecutive national title?<br />\nCan Johns Hopkins bring the<br />\nchampionship back to<br />\nHomewood? Is it possible that<br />\nsomeone else will prevent<br />\nanother meeting between the<br />\nOrange and Blue Jays?<br />\nI can tell you that in the<br />\ntight-knit small world of col<br />\nlege lacrosse it is just about impossible for a new kid to crash<br />\nthe big party and come away<br />\nwith a natianal championship.<br />\nIn 1990, expect the usual contenders and pretenders for the<br />\ntitle to compete for NCAA<br />\ntournament bids and the Final<br />\nFour at Rutgers, May 26-28.<br />\nThere are five teams\u2014<br />\nSyracuse, Hopkins, North<br />\nCarolina, Loyola, and<br />\nVirginia\u2014with the talent to<br />\nwin the championship. What<br />\nwill determine the champion is<br />\nwhich team peaks at the right<br />\ntime and has the dominant<br />\nplayer that can take control of<br />\na game at crunch time.<br />\nAfter this group there are<br />\napproximately a dozen teams<br />\nin contention for the seven remaining tournament berths.<br />\nWhile several of these teams<br />\nare quite capable of upsetting<br />\nsomeone's trip to the Final<br />\nFour, it is unlikely that any of<br />\nthem have the overall talent to<br />\nstring together a championship<br />\nrun.<br />\nThe following is a closer<br />\nlook at one view of how the<br />\nI2-team NCAA tournament<br />\nfield will be filled in May.<br />\nI. SYRACUSE<br />\nThe Gaits. When lacrosse<br />\npeople talk about Syracuse's<br />\n<br />\ntwin All-America midfielders,<br />\nGary and Paul Gait, they speak<br />\nin hushed toes as if \"The<br />\nGaits\" were a new street gang<br />\nor an invading horde of barbarians. They are two of the<br />\nfew college lacrosse players<br />\nwith the size and speed of bigtime running backs. Added to<br />\ntheir intimidating physical<br />\npresence, the Gait boys bring<br />\nthe dazzling stick skills honed<br />\nin the box lacrosse leagues of<br />\ntheir native British Columbia.<br />\nAny way you look at it both<br />\nGary and Paul Gait are<br />\noutstanding lacrosse players<br />\nand Syracuse has them to<br />\nspearhead its run-and-gun<br />\noffense.<br />\nHowever, before pronouncing Syracuse national champions let us remember that<br />\nGary and Paul are both human,<br />\nas Dave Pietramala helped<br />\ndemonstrate, and that the<br />\nOrange are forced to field<br />\neight other players. Syracuse's<br />\n\"eight other players\" are pretty good as well. At midfield,<br />\nthe Orange can also depend<br />\nupon the speed of senior<br />\nRodney<br />\nDumpson and<br />\nMaryland transfer Tom<br />\nGilmartin.<br />\nOn attack the Orange return<br />\nsecond-team All-America Tom<br />\nMarachek, as well as seniors<br />\nGreg Burns and Jim Egan.<br />\nThis group is dangerous and<br />\nexperienced but lost to graduation first-team All-America<br />\nJohn Zulberti. The Orange<br />\nhave enough firepower to<br />\nreplace Zulberti's goal scoring<br />\nbut his absence also leaves a<br />\nleadership void on the field<br />\nthat might not be as easily<br />\nreplaced.<br />\nThe biggest challenge for<br />\nCoach Roy Simmons, Jr. will<br />\nbe to solidify a defense that lost<br />\nthree of its to four players.<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\nScott Marr takes a diving shot in the Choice Visa Classic last October.<br />\nHowever, the one returning<br />\ndefender is first-team AllAmerica Pat McCabe.<br />\nMcCabe, a high school teammate of Hopkins' Matt<br />\nPanetta, may be the best<br />\ndefenseman in the nation this<br />\nyear. In goal Simmons will<br />\nhave a tough decision between<br />\nincumbent Matt Palumb, who<br />\nhas minded the nets in two<br />\nNCAA title games, and<br />\nsophomore Jerry DeLorenzo,<br />\nwho many lacrosse insiders<br />\nconsider more talented. The<br />\nquestion remains whether<br />\nSyracuse can play disciplined<br />\ndefense when faced with a<br />\ntight game and a talented opponent that will not rollover.<br />\nThe Orangemen have the<br />\ngame's most talented roster,<br />\nthe money ballplayers, and the<br />\nconfidence that comes with<br />\nchampionship experience.<br />\nThere is no doubt that<br />\nSyracuse is the team to beat.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Don Zimmerman has a<br />\nteam with the ability to<br />\nchallenge for the title once<br />\nagain.<br />\nHopkins' success begins<br />\nwith outstanding defense, and<br />\nthe defense starts with the<br />\ngoalkeeper. No one has a better goalie than Hopkins' Quint<br />\nKessenich. Kessenich, a twotime first-team All-America,<br />\nnot only makes all the plays he<br />\nshould, but is also capable of<br />\nputting together the type of hot<br />\nstreak that can carry a team in<br />\nthe tournament. The close<br />\ndefense will miss AllEverything Dave Pietramala to<br />\nbe sure, but there is enough<br />\ntalent to round-out an excellent<br />\nunit. Junior Bill Dwan earned<br />\nAll-America honors last<br />\nseason and is ready for a big<br />\nJames<br />\nSenior<br />\nyear.<br />\nDeTomasso returns to action<br />\nafter missing last season with<br />\na knee injury, and will be<br />\ncounted on for his experience.<br />\n2. JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nSophomore Nick Shevillo<br />\nThe Blue Jays appear steps in to man the crease<br />\nhungry and determined to win defense position. The defenthe championship that eluded sive midfield features exthem by one goal last season. perienced performers in Brian<br />\nVoelker and Jamie McNealey.<br />\nThe Blue Jays' depth, including freshmen Michael<br />\nWohltmann, Tom Sullivan,<br />\nand Steve McMahon, is<br />\ntalented but inexperienced.<br />\nHow quickly Hopkins' young<br />\ndefenders adapt to the college<br />\ngame will greatly determine<br />\nthe team's success.<br />\nAt midfield Hopkins needs<br />\nto receive a big year from<br />\nsophomores Adam Wright and<br />\nBrian Lukacz. Expect Wright<br />\nand Lukacz to provide the<br />\nmidfield's offensive power and<br />\nemerge as major players this<br />\nseason. Senior Greg Kelly and<br />\nfreshman Charlie Speno add to<br />\na midfield that has the potential to develop into a stronger<br />\ngroup than in '89.<br />\nThe Blue Jays attack needs<br />\nto reach a higher level of con-<br />\n<br />\nsistency. Junior Matt Panetta<br />\nis a bona fide star who has the<br />\nability to dominate a game at<br />\ntimes. The other members of<br />\nthe attack have talent but have<br />\nnot managed to distinguish<br />\nthemselves for a sustained<br />\nperiod of time. Expect Jay<br />\nClarke, Scott Marr, Jeff Wills,<br />\nand Mike Morrissey all to get<br />\na chance to earn a regular spot<br />\nin the lineup.<br />\nThe '90 Blue Jays are<br />\nanother Hopkins team with the<br />\ningredients for a title run in<br />\nplace. Hopkins needs to improve its consistency on offense and have its young<br />\ndefensemen mature quickly in<br />\norder to make plans for<br />\nanother trip to the Final Four.<br />\n3. NORTH CAROLINA<br />\nThe loose and confident Tar<br />\nHeels are one of the most difficult teams in the country to<br />\nfigure out. They often<br />\nunderachieve in the regular<br />\nseason and end up seeded<br />\nlower than their talent deserves<br />\nin the NCAA's. Then UNC<br />\nwill upset a higher seed (such<br />\nas Loyola last season) and<br />\nmake a serious challenge for<br />\nthe championship. The Tar<br />\nHeels should be no easier to<br />\npredict in '90.<br />\nNorth Carolina is once again<br />\na dangerous offensivp team<br />\nwith a world of athletic ability. In addition, the Heels may<br />\nhave a little bit of wounded<br />\npride since they have not<br />\nplayed in a title game since<br />\nwinning the championship in<br />\n1986. Last season UNC fell<br />\n10-6 to Hopkins in the NCAA<br />\nsemifinals.<br />\nCoach Willie Scroggs has a<br />\npotent offense returning led by<br />\nattackmen Dennis Goldstein<br />\nand Michael Thomas. Goldstein gave the Hopkins defense<br />\nnightmares with seven goals in<br />\ntheir two mettings last year.<br />\nThe junior appears ready to<br />\nfollow in the footsteps of his<br />\n<br />\n\fLACROSSE '90/5<br />\nbrother, former Cornell<br />\nrecord-setter Tim Goldstein,<br />\nwith an All-American campaign in '90.<br />\nAt midfield the Heels are<br />\nloaded, with seniors Chip<br />\nMayer and Steve Huff, along<br />\nwith '89 ACC Rookie of the<br />\nYear Jim Buczek, leading the<br />\nway. The swift Buczek may<br />\ndevelop into UNC's next AllAmerica midfield candidate.<br />\nThe Tar Heels also brought in<br />\na fine recruiting class including<br />\nseveral midfielders that are excontribute<br />\npected<br />\nto<br />\nimmediately.<br />\nOn defense Carolina faces<br />\nits biggest question mark, who<br />\nto play in goal? The Tar Heels<br />\nneed to find an adequate goalie<br />\nif they are to become<br />\nlegitimate title contenders.<br />\nWhoever is in the goal for<br />\nUNC will be happy to have<br />\nhonorable mention AllAmerica and team captain Joe<br />\nBreschi return to the defense.<br />\nThe Tar Heels will be tough<br />\nand they will be dangerous, the<br />\nonly problem is figuring out<br />\nwhen they will be these things.<br />\nIf Carolina plays with desire<br />\nand any kind of consistency,<br />\nthen you do not want to play<br />\nit once tournament time rolls<br />\naround.<br />\n4. LOYOLA<br />\nThis is the year that Loyola<br />\nproves that it can play with the<br />\nbig boys. Head coach Dave<br />\nCottle may have the most<br />\nbalanced team in the country<br />\nas the Greyhounds return<br />\nseven starters from last year's<br />\nNCAA quarterfinalists. The<br />\nprimary challenge confronting<br />\nLoyola is a mental one; the<br />\nGreyhounds need to win a big<br />\ngame in the tourney and<br />\nbelieve that they belong on the<br />\nfield with the traditional<br />\npowers.<br />\nThe attack lost first-team<br />\nAll-America Mike Ruland, but<br />\nChris Colbeck, Sean Smith,<br />\nand Jim Blanding all have<br />\ntalent. Highly regarded<br />\nfreshman Kevin Beach should<br />\nalso push for serious playing<br />\ntime. The Loyola midfield will<br />\nfeature All-America Brian<br />\nKroneberger. Kroneberger is<br />\na player who could develop into the type of prime-time per-<br />\n<br />\nformer that a championship<br />\nclub can rely upon. Joining<br />\nKroneberger at midfield will<br />\nbe Kevin Anderson, Ted<br />\nNichols, and Chris Gunkel.<br />\nThe defense is in capable<br />\nhands with honorable mention<br />\nAll-Americas returning in<br />\ngoalie Charlie Toomey and<br />\ndefender Gary Beach. The<br />\nclose defense also welcomes<br />\nback starter Sean Quinn and<br />\nexperienced players Scott<br />\nOslislo and Tom Johnson. The<br />\nlong-stick midfield has senior<br />\nChris McGovern and soph<br />\nDennis Colon available for<br />\nduty.<br />\nOverall the Greyhounds are<br />\nreturning one of the most experienced groups of players in<br />\nthe country and they appear<br />\nready for a push into the bigtime. Inside word has it that<br />\nLoyola has looked very strong<br />\nin preseason scrimmages and<br />\nis focusing on a tough early<br />\nschedule that opens with<br />\nRutgers and Virginia.<br />\nLoyola definitely has the<br />\nability to contend for the<br />\nThe<br />\ncrown.<br />\nNCAA<br />\nGreyhounds need to get a win<br />\nover a top ranked team in the<br />\ntournament so that they can<br />\nbelieve in themselves.<br />\n5.

Even in<br />\nthe pouring spring rains for<br />\nwhich Baltimore is famous, the<br />\nband stays by the team, playing and cheering until the final<br />\nwhistle.<br />\nThe band has a remarkable<br />\nlevel of alumni loyalty as well.<br />\nEspecially, at Homecoming,<br />\nformer members of the group<br />\nreturn to play at the games.<br />\nSome alumni have been coming back for over twenty years.<br />\nAlthough new songs are<br />\nadded from time to time, the<br />\nband's repertoire remains consistent. Certain Hopkins fight<br />\nsongs have been around for<br />\ndecades. \"To Win\" is played<br />\nevery time Hopkins scores a<br />\ngoal; fans and alumni sing<br />\nalong. (The song changes to<br />\n\"Ach, Du Lieber\" after 20<br />\ngoals, and the \"Beer Barrel<br />\nPolka\" at 25.)<br />\nAfter the song ends, a chant<br />\n<br />\nbegins, counting off the<br />\nnumber of goals scored so far<br />\nand adding \"We want more!\"<br />\nat the end. \"Johnny Hopkins<br />\nOn To Victory\" is heard when<br />\nthe team comes onto the field<br />\nat the start of each half and<br />\nagain at the end of the game.<br />\nJohn<br />\nPhillip<br />\nSousa's<br />\n\"Washington Post\" march is<br />\n<br />\nplayed as the crowd files out.<br />\nAlso, older players and fans<br />\noften request \"On the Line,\"<br />\na fight song from the early part<br />\nof this century.<br />\nA number of long-standing,<br />\nif unusual, traditions surround<br />\nthe band as well. Probably the<br />\nmost famous\u2014or infamous\u2014<br />\nof these is the \"banana goal.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn the fourth quarter of every<br />\nlacrosse game, the band<br />\nmembers and diehard lacrosse<br />\ngroupies try to gauge which<br />\nwill be the final goal. If<br />\nHopkins is already far ahead,<br />\nthe first goal of the fourth<br />\nquarter is chosen. The musicians and fans each take a<br />\nbanana and eagerly wait.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the goal is scored, the<br />\nfans cheer wildly, waving the<br />\nbananas, sing along with \"To<br />\nWin,\" and eat their bananas.<br />\nThe player scoring the goal<br />\nusually receives a thrown<br />\nbanana as well. Rumor has it<br />\nthat the tradition began when<br />\na game-winning, come-frombehind victory took place just<br />\nas a lacrosse fan was peeling<br />\na banana for lunch. Admittedly, there's no real point to this<br />\npractice, but it's a great<br />\ntradition.<br />\nPerhaps it is indicative of the<br />\nband's strong presence in<br />\nHopkins lacrosse history that<br />\nthe stadium on Homewood<br />\nField is named not for a<br />\nlacrosse hero or wealthy alumnus but for the the band's<br />\noriginal conductor, Conrad<br />\nGebelein. \"Gebby\" conducted<br />\nthe band from its ROTCoffshoot beginnings in the<br />\n1920's until his retirement in<br />\n1971.<br />\n<br />\nTimed clears and fewer long sticks:<br />\nZimmerman reacts to the rule changes<br />\nby Mary Hillebrand<br />\nFor a lacrosse team, the<br />\nopening of the season each<br />\nspring means another chance<br />\nto make a bid for number one.<br />\nBut behind all the fanfare and<br />\npep talks, each new season<br />\nalso brings with it a handful of<br />\nrule changes, usually designed to make the game more exciting to watch.<br />\nThis year, fans can expect<br />\nfaster paced games, thanks to<br />\ntwo of these rule changes.<br />\nFirst, past teams have been<br />\nallowed to use five long sticks<br />\n(defensive sticks) on the field<br />\nat once.

McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: the scrapheap.<br />\nI have tons of work to do, and<br />\nI really don't have time to write<br />\na thematically sound column, so<br />\nthis week's installment will consist of all those ideas that I'd really like to develop into complete<br />\ncolumns, but can't for whatever<br />\nreason.<br />\nI guess thematically, we could<br />\ncall it \"Those Aspects of Human<br />\nExistence that Chris Finds Most<br />\nPeculiar.\"<br />\nOne of the most peculiar<br />\nthings, for me, at least, is the fact<br />\nthat facial tissue is about four<br />\ntimes the size of bathroom<br />\ntissue\u2014and twice as thick. Consider this: you get an eight-inch<br />\nby eight-inch four-ply square for<br />\nyour nose (the biggest honker requiring maybe ten square inches<br />\nat most) but you get a four-byfour one-ply square, albeit a<br />\nrough ply most of the time, for<br />\nyour derriere (I won't speculate<br />\non what size the largest tush<br />\nmight need).<br />\nNumber two: snarfing. It is<br />\nsaid that in some countries, it is<br />\ncommon courtesy to belch after<br />\na good meal, and most<br />\nAmericans, I think, would find<br />\nthat gross. By the same token,<br />\nhowever, I have found that many<br />\nAmericans consider it a tremendous achievement if they can get<br />\none of their close friends to snarf<br />\nat a meal, an achievement worthy of countless anecdotal repetitions to those other close friends<br />\nwho might have missed the event.<br />\nEditor's Note to those Belching<br />\nVisitors to Our Fine Country<br />\nWho Might Not Know What the<br />\nVerb \"To Snarf\" Means, Let<br />\nAlone How to Conjugate It: It is<br />\nan odd fact of the human anatomy<br />\nthat when faced with possible<br />\nasphyxiation by combining<br />\nlaughter with commonly imbibed fluids, the brain has the ability to register the embarassment<br />\nfactor of said fluid in the event of<br />\ndeath (i.e. it is much cooler to die<br />\n\"choking violently on a dry martini\" than to die \"gagging,<br />\nmoustache-laden, on 2% milk.\").<br /><br />\nGiven that a particular drink is<br />\njust too hysterical to let somebody<br />\ndie on, the brain will cause a sudden and jarring peristaltic twitch,<br />\nforcing said drink back up,<br />\nhopefully, through the mouth. In<br />\nthe event that this mouth is not<br />\nbusy laughing, the result will be<br />\na \"saliva tocarum,\" more commonly called a \"spit take.\" If the<br />\nmouth is laughing, however, the<br />\ntongue will be pressed against the<br />\nesophagus, and the drink will be<br />\nforced out another egress, namely, the nose. The passage from<br />\nesophagus to nose is an intricate<br />\none, filled with many organs<br />\ndesigned to transform ordinary<br />\nfood into mucous-based lifeforms. The emergence of these<br />\nlife-forms is \"snarfing.\"<br />\nThird, of course, is elevatorbutton-punching, best illustrated<br />\nthusly: Person approaches<br />\nElevator. Person pushes \"up\"<br />\nbutton, thus alerting Elevator of<br />\nhis/her presence. Elevator, on<br />\nanother floor, may take ten or<br />\ntwelve seconds to arrive. Person,<br />\nangered that Elevator was not<br />\nnotified earlier of his arrival,<br />\nstrikes on the notion that perhaps<br />\npressing the \"up\" button 9,000<br />\nmore times will make it arrive<br />\nfaster. This act is usually coupled with a glance up at the ceiling<br />\nin order that Person, capable of<br />\nvision through solids, might<br />\nwatch Elevator's hurried approach. This activity was what<br />\nprompted me to submit the<br />\nStupidity Bill to Congress, in<br />\norder to mandate a \"Slap Law.\"<br />\nThe \"Slap Law\" gives<br />\npedestrians the rights and responsibilities of deputies when acts of<br />\nstupidity are witnessed. A<br />\npedestrian witnessing someone in<br />\nfront of an elevator, for example,<br />\ntapping the drum solo to<br />\n\"Wipeout\" on the call button<br />\nwith head upturned, would have<br />\nthe duty of stopping the person<br />\nimmediately and slapping him or<br />\nher across the face, winning<br />\nanother battle in the war against<br />\nstupidity.<br />\nSee PUNCH, 7<br /><br />\nwould like to begin a weekly \"Cartoon\" section.

Make sure<br />\nto pick up your News-Letter Lacrosse Preview at Hoppy<br />\nHour and around campus.<br /><br />\nFor the first time, I feel sufficiently incensed to write to the<br />\nNews-Letter, thanks to Mr. Dick<br />\nOles.<br />\nHis attitude, while I'm sure<br />\nhe'd consider it well-thought-out,<br />\nscreams self-contradiction. He<br />\ncorrectly,(though not originally),<br />\npointed out the hypocrisy of an<br />\nadministration which permits the<br />\nshowing of pornographic films,<br />\nwhile it thrills in taking action<br />\nagainst what was construed as a<br />\nsexist cartoon in The Spectator.<br />\n(And yes, Mr. Oles, some<br />\nwomen do size up men in that<br />\nway. Everyone sizes up others<br />\n\"in their own way.\" How else is<br />\none to decide if one is attracted<br />\nto another, physically or intellectually? I fail to see the brilliance<br />\nof your point.) He also repeated<br />\nthe apparent irony of a newspaper<br />\nrun by liberals practicing censorship/editorial prerogative, depending on your point of view.<br />\nAgain, very original. He also attacks people who label anyone<br />\nwho disagrees with them \"racist\"<br />\nor \"sexist\". His first mistake is<br />\nin not realizing that those are not<br />\ntrue liberals. His second mistake<br />\nis in not realizing that he appears<br />\nto exhibit a characterisitic similar<br />\nto the radicals he attacks: labeling anyone who annoys him a<br />\n\"liberal:'<br />\nClearly, Mr. Oles, you lack<br />\noriginality and abound in, yes,<br />\nclosed-mindedness.

If this strip had<br />\ntargeted any other minority group<br />\non campus, it would not have<br /><br />\nbeen printed.<br />\nEvidently there was another<br />\ncartoon by the same artist submitted to the Spectator, but because<br />\nof space restrictions it was not<br />\nprinted. The alternative strip<br />\npresented an issue similar to the<br />\none in the printed cartoon, but it<br />\nwas aimed at the men of Johns<br />\nHopkins instead of the women.<br />\nThe editors of the Spectator chose<br />\nthe cartoon that they found to be<br />\nthe most humorous. Obviously it<br />\nis funnier, or more accepted, to<br />\nmock women than men.<br />\nThe cartoon itself was meant to<br />\noffend. The artist even told us to<br />\nwhom we should address hate<br />\nmail. We question the intent of<br />\nthis article. It seems that there<br />\nmust be more mature and meaningful ways to address the issue<br />\nof sexism, if dialogue among the<br />\ncommunity is truly the intent. The<br />\nidea that women should be judged by their looks rather than their<br />\nintelligence is blatantly sexist and<br />\ndiscriminatory. Threatened by intelligent women, some people attempt to diminish their worth by<br />\nusing the media's argument that<br />\na woman's value is determinined by her looks. Seemingly innocent remarks or jokes such as this<br />\nare the most pervasive forms of<br />\ndiscrimination today. By unconsciously accepting these views<br />\nwe reinforce our learned biases.<br />\nBy laughing at African<br />\nAmericans, Jews, Puerto Ricans,<br />\nhomosexuals, and women we are<br />\nsubordinating these groups. We<br />\nhope that any future discussion of<br />\nthe \"2x +1\" article will focus on<br />\nthe real issue at hand.<br />\nFinally, the Women's Center's<br />\nprimary goal is not to accuse. We<br />\nare a resource center for anyone<br />\ninterested in women's issues.<br />\nMarch is International Women's<br />\n,Month and we will be sponsoring several events to celebrate<br />\nwomen's solidarity. Although<br />\nproblems of sexism still exist, we<br />\nwould like to encourage a more<br />\npositive approach to women's<br />\nissues, and we invite you all(men<br />\nand women alike) to attend our<br />\nupcoming events.<br /><br />\nRoberts and Sykes<br />\nDo you remember all of those<br />\nin<br />\nlearned<br />\nyou<br />\nthings<br />\nmicroeconomics? Consumers<br />\ntend to act in their own best interest. If two products are exactly the same the buyer will always<br />\nchoose the lower-priced item. A<br />\nhundred dollars today is better<br />\nthan a hundred dollars tomorrow.<br />\nAll of these assumptions,<br />\nhowever, are constantly mitigated<br />\nby the complexities of our free<br />\nmarket economy. That is why<br />\nbusiness courses often ask the student to depart from the conformities of the academic world and<br />\nenter the real world of advertising, personal discount rates, and<br />\nindividual preference. Consumers<br /><br />\nrarely act in a rational manner.<br />\nA recent study in the<br />\nWashington Post(Feb. 12)offers<br />\na look at American attitudes<br />\ntowards money. A hundred people were asked how they would<br />\nlike to be paid for a hypothetical<br />\nsix-year-long job. They could<br />\nreceive their salary in equal installments, in decreasing installments, or with paychecks that<br />\nstarted low and gradually increased. One would imagine that<br />\neveryone would want to receive<br />\ndeclining installments. That way<br />\nyou could invest the surplus<br />\nsalary and earn interest on it for<br />\nsix years. Or if you quit early,<br />\nyou would have maximized your<br /><br />\nLetters<br /><br />\nAs a concerned student of this<br />\nUniversity, I was particularly<br />\ntroubled at a statement made by<br />\nCouncil presidential candidate<br />\nArt Yoon. Mr. Yoon, at the recent candidates forum, made the<br />\ncomment that he felt the problems<br />\nof racism and sexism were not an<br />\nissue on this campus, and that it<br />\nis not the role of Student Council to deal with such issues unless<br />\nspecific problems arose. Mr.<br />\nYoon further stated that he felt<br /><br />\ndiscussion of such issues would<br />\nonly heighten any tensions which<br />\nmight exist on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nI must adamantly reply that I<br />\nfeel Mr. Yoon is misguided in his<br />\nbeliefs. Racism, sexism, and for<br />\nthat matter elitism are a serious<br />\nproblem on this campus. I must<br />\nwonder if Mr. Yoon has had his<br />\neyes and ears open during his<br />\nyears here at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nMustvents be dramatically conducted and flagrantly paraded in<br />\nthe face of fellow students for<br />\nsome to take notice? Much goes<br />\non beneath the surface at this<br />\nUniversity which is often brushed over in a \"feel-good\" manner.<br />\nThis cannot be allowed to continue. I applaud the efforts of<br />\nanother presidential candidate for<br />\nhis ideas to make the problems of<br />\nracism, sexism, and elitism an<br />\nopen issue in this campaign. I further congratulate this candidate<br />\nfor his innovative idea to include<br />\na member of Dr. Francine<br />\nAshby's Student Committee on<br />\nEthno-Violence (which holds its<br />\nfirst meeting today) as a nonvoting advisory member to student council.<br />\nAs a current Housemaster, I<br />\nmust say that all of us at the Office of Residential Life have<br />\nworked hard to educate the<br />\nfreshman class to the various evils<br />\nof the three isms. I am shocked<br />\nand appalled that a current<br />\nmember of Student Council<br />\nwould state that such issues are<br />\nnot the role of student government members to deal with. I<br />\ncannot believe that many of his<br />\ncolleagues feel this way. I would<br />\nremind Mr. Yoon that student<br />\ncouncil should exist as a place for<br />\nleaders who wish to bring a<br />\npositive vision of student life here<br />\nat Hopkins to fruition. Thus,<br />\nworking with student organizations such as BSA, JSA, GALA,<br />\nand the Women's Center to promote a greater sense of<br />\nunderstanding is imperative.<br />\nFailure to confront serious issues<br />\nwhich seek to divide the student<br />\nbody and threaten an overall environment of enlightenment must<br />\nbe viewed as extremely<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nI must state that Mr. Yoon<br />\nprefaced his remarks with the<br />\ncomment that his views were probably not going to be popular.<br /><br />\nincome for the time that you<br />\nworked. What did the survey<br />\nfind? An overwhelming 76 percent of the respondents wanted<br />\ntheir wages to increase. Even<br />\nafter they were given an explanation of the advantages behind<br />\ndecreasing installments, 69 percent still went for the increasing<br />\nscale. Economic theorists should<br />\nbe taking notes.<br />\nThe same article describes the<br />\nphenomenon of consumer decisions. Suppose you are given the<br />\nchoice between two identical<br />\nrefridgerators. Brand X cost $800<br />\nto buys and uses $25 a year in<br />\nelectricity. Brand Y costs $700 to<br />\nbuy and uses $85 a year in electricity: The obvious choice is<br />\nBrand X. Even allowing for the<br />\ndevaluation of money, the more<br />\nexpensive refrigerator will save<br />\nthe purchaser about $200 over the<br />\ncourse of ten years. Yet people<br />\noften choose Brand Y. In other<br />\nwords, the value of $100 today<br /><br />\nis worth more to them than the<br />\nprospect of $300 in the future.<br />\nThis is not common sense, but it<br />\ndoes reflect the high personal discount rates that often affect consumer spending.<br />\nHow does all of this relate to<br />\nlarger economic issues? It certainly plays a role in the continued acceptance of deficit spending. People seem willing to bank<br />\non future prosperity. Historically low savings rates may be attributed to a country that has<br />\nbecome conditioned to living<br />\nbeyond its means. The fact that<br />\npeople are unable or unwilling to<br />\nexhibit sound economic behavior<br />\nhas a number of ramifications for<br />\npublic policy. Efforts to increase<br />\nsavings and investment require<br />\nprivate initiative. A person who<br />\npurchases \"Brand Y\" items will<br />\nbe unlikely to respond to a<br />\ngovernment tax rebate intended to<br />\nencourage savings. The solution<br />\nto this problem may be found in<br /><br />\nLETTERS, from 5<br />\nRush .<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn this campus of cynical and<br />\notherwise apathetic intellectuals,<br />\nit was refreshing to see the lively protest in honor of our President's visit last Thursday.

Richardson. Apparently, according to Joanne<br />\nHoulahan, this should be possible. Further, she said, her discussions as part of the Armstrong<br />\ncommittee had led her to believe<br />\nthat Richardson has a keen interest in revamping the teaching<br />\nof graduate students at Hopkins.<br />\nespecially with .a view to getting<br />\nPhD students, through quicker.<br />\nThis however brings one to the<br />\nproblem of what many perceive<br />\nde eartIS a trend towards man<br /><br />\nments' becoming little more than<br />\n\"service departments,\" meaning<br />\nthat they are concerned with<br />\nchurning out undergrads as<br />\nquickly as possible with little emphasis on new research. Departments that have particularly<br />\nsuffered, it is generally agreed,<br />\ninclude the language departments<br />\nand Biology. The latter used once<br />\nto require a lab for each class at<br />\nthe undergrad level. Now the<br />\nstudents can get away with taking only two lab classes for the<br />\nB.A., and they are only required<br />\nfro those taking classes to get into med school.<br />\nThis problem has been intensified by the five-year plan's enforcement of a ten percent cut in<br />\nfaculty numbers, to be acheived<br />\nthrough attrition. Thus important<br />\nvacancies may well remain unfilled. Certainly, they will not be<br />\nautomatically filled. As things<br />\nstand now, since the implementation of the plan, departments<br />\nwith recent vacancies must petition to have them filled. Arts &amp;<br />\nSciences Dean Lloyd Armstrong<br />\ndecides each case on an ad hoc<br />\nbasis. To say the least, this would<br />\ncertainly seem to go against the<br />\ngrain of what incoming-president<br />\nRichardson is purported to want.<br />\nThe bind the school finds itself<br />\nin is simple. Undergrads provide<br />\nrevenue. Grads do not.<br />\nMoreover, some subjects are currently in high demand with<br />\nundergrads, such as International<br />\nRelations. The school is therefore<br />\npressure\u2014economic<br />\nunder<br />\npressure, if nothing else\u2014to let<br />\nundergrads into these majors in<br />\ngreater numbers as a way of increasing the cash flowing into<br />\nArts &amp; Sciences. So far, so good.<br />\nThe problem lies in the fact that<br />\nHopkins' reputation is built on its<br />\nstatus as a research institution,<br />\nrather than a place of teaching.<br />\nHopkins always has been, and<br />\nstill is, a cross between a college<br />\nand a think-tank. But its name<br />\nrests on that think-tank component. However, other researchoriented establishments have far<br />\nlarger endowments than Hopkins<br />\nhas. We cannot afford not to<br />\nteach larger and larger numbers<br /><br />\n_<br />\nof undergrads.<br />\nAnd yet we don't cio a particularly good job of it. For this<br />\ncomes at a time when many professors are trying to shed some of<br />\ntheir advising responsibility due<br />\nto the amount of research time it<br />\ncuts into. Since 1975, there has<br />\nbeen a staggering 70 percent drop<br />\nin the proportion of undergrads<br />\ntaking the honors option, which<br />\nincludes for the most part an individually supervised senior<br />\nthesis. On top of this, the Office<br />\nof Acedemic Advising, which<br />\ndoes an excellent job under the<br />\nmost adverse of circumstances, is<br />\nencouraging students to rely on<br />\ntheir own departments' council,<br />\nrather than the less specific advice<br />\noffered by Academic Advising.<br />\nIn some departments, it has<br />\nbecome common for advising<br />\nresponsibilities to be given over<br />\nto grad students; the profs no<br />\nlonger have the time.<br />\nAll of which puts more<br />\npressure on the long-suffering<br />\ngrad population. Smaller<br />\nstipends, because of financial<br />\ncuts. Greater teaching\u2014and now,<br />\nadvising\u2014loads, because of the<br />\nten-percent cut in faculty. Wayda<br />\ngo, Steve.<br />\nThe cumulative result will<br />\nsimply be that Hopkins' name<br />\nplummets still further. Grad<br />\nstudents must no longer be taken<br />\nfor granted. Hopkins must either<br />\ncontinue to let grads in at the current fairly high rate, while<br />\nguaranteeing them enough funding to get through their programs quickly, without having to<br />\nresort to teaching and outside jobs<br />\nto support themselves. Or it must<br />\ndrastically reduce the number of<br />\ngrads admitted, while agreeing to<br />\nfund them for longer as each grad<br />\nsoaks up an inevitably larger<br />\nteaching load.<br />\nEither path will do. The current<br />\none will not.

This program was co-sponsored by the<br />\nWomen's Studies Program and<br />\nthe Ford Foundation.<br />\nThe seminar drew a small<br />\ncrowd, about forty people, and<br />\nwas well-received. Mary Poovey,<br />\nco-ordinator of the seminar,<br />\nstated that abortion would be \"the<br />\npolitical issue of the 1990's,\"<br />\nespecially after the 1989 Supreme<br />\nCourt Case of Webster v.<br />\nReproductive Health Services.<br /><br />\nIn their decision on this issue,<br />\nthe court chose to give individual<br />\nstates the right to legislate and reject the rights of women to have<br />\nabortions. It showed an \"interest<br />\nin prenatal life at .the risk of<br />\nwomen's bodies,\" and has led to<br />\nchanges in the abortion policies<br />\nof many individual states.<br />\nAs co-ordinator of this<br />\nseminar, Ms. Poovey introduced<br />\nthree speakers who spoke on the<br />\nrepercussions of the Supreme<br />\nCourt's decision. The speakers<br />\nwere Professor Sylvia Law, of<br />\nthe NYU Law School, Professor<br />\nFaye Ginsberg, NYU Department of Anthropology, and Jean-<br /><br />\nnie I. Rosoff, from the Alan Guftmacher Institute. After the three<br />\nlectures concluded, a round-table<br />\ndiscussion was held with the three<br />\nspeakers as well as with Ms.<br />\nPoovey and Connie Nathanson<br />\nand Lorna Thorpe, two members<br />\nof the. Hopkins community.<br />\nProfessor Sylvia Law's lecture<br />\nwas the most Interesting of the<br />\nthree. Law worked as a historian<br />\nfor the case of Webster v.<br />\nReproductive Health Services,<br />\nresearching the history of abortion in the United States. She<br />\nchose to work on this case<br />\nbecause she knew that a loss<br />\nwould give states \"very broad<br /><br />\n11011111ftwor<br /><br />\n4111111111111111111<br /><br />\nMichael Blumhardt<br /><br />\nStudents ponder the meaning of life and art.<br /><br />\nrights to limit women's rights\"<br />\nin situations such as abortions.<br />\nShe worked as part of a group of<br />\nlawyers\u2014\"all women\"\u2014to<br />\nprepare information for the court<br />\non the history of abortion. Such<br />\ninformation could prove valuable<br />\nto the court's decisions not only<br />\nin the Webster case, but also in<br />\nfuture cases involving abortion.<br />\nThe pro-choice historical team<br />\nhad two main goals. First, they<br />\nhoped to \"prevent the stupid use<br />\nof history,\" as it was being<br />\npresented by the pro-life coalition. This goal was successful, as<br />\nno mention of history was made<br />\nin the final write-up of the case.<br />\nThe second, more ambitious<br />\ngoal, was to \"tell the truth\" about<br />\nthe history of abortion. This was<br />\nmore difficult, as the history of<br />\nsuch is hard to trace in a manner<br />\nsuitable for use with the prochoice argument. For most of<br />\nhistory, abortions were not illegal, but rather a part of the<br />\nsocial practices and beliefs of the<br />\nordinary people.<br />\nThe cases against abortion<br />\nthroughout history focus around<br />\ndiscrimation ag .inst women and<br />\nthe attempts of men to \"keep<br />\nwomen in their place.\" Law<br />\npoints out, however, that in today's society such an argument<br />\nwould be declared both sexist and<br />\nunconstitutional. She asserts that<br />\nit is not right to use the<br />\n\"discrimination against women<br />\nhistorically as justification for its<br />\ncontinuance.\"<br />\nInstead, the pro-life movement<br />\nhas argued for the \"rights of the<br />\nfetus,\" the unborn child. This<br />\njustification is not found<br />\nhistorically, and most likely arose<br />\n\"in part as a surrogate for other<br />\nmotivations that ate no longer<br />\nconstitutionally or socially acceptable,\" such as the right of men<br />\nto keep women in their place.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n4<br /><br />\nAs Professor Law researched<br />\nthe history of this volatile issue,<br />\nshe discovered that abortion was<br />\nactually more common in the<br />\nnineteenth century than it is today. In 1871, for instance, when<br />\nNew York City had a population<br />\nof under one million, there were<br />\nover two hundred full-time abortion clinics in operation, not including doctors who would perform the operation as part of<br />\ngeneral practices. This number is<br />\nmore than that of clinics in NYC<br />\nduring 1990.<br />\nFitting such information into<br />\nher final report for the court was<br />\ndifficult, Prof. Law admits. She<br />\nadmits that there is an \"inherent<br />\ntension between truth-telling and<br />\nadvocacy,\" and that advocacy<br />\ncan often lead to a \"distortion of<br />\ntruth.\" This was hard to guard<br />\nagainst and sometimes led to the<br />\ninability to use certain informa-<br /><br />\ntion in .her brief.<br />\nOne such case concerned the<br />\nhistory of abortion at the time of<br />\nthe founding fathers. It was said<br />\nto be \"quite common and widely acceptable.\" Further research,<br />\nhowever, proved that there was<br />\nlittle background for such statement. So, in the final draft, it was<br />\nonly possible for Prof. Law to say<br />\nthat abortion was \"known and not<br />\nillegal\" during that time period.<br />\nSuch in-depth research seems<br />\nto have played an important role<br />\nin the Supreme Court's decision<br />\nlast year. Still, Prof. Law feels<br />\nthat we \"can't be optimistic\"<br />\nabout the court continuing to<br />\nallow abortions legally in the<br />\nUnited States. Such a determination is likely to be made within<br />\nthis decade, as the issue of abortion continues to be, as Ms.<br />\nPoovey stated, \"catapulted to the<br />\nforefront of political activity.\"<br /><br />\nNORTHWESTERN<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br /><br />\nSUMMER<br />\nPOSITIONS<br />\nAVAILABLE<br />\nSummer Residential Counseling for the<br />\nCollege Preparation Program<br />\n\u2022Assist 50 high school juniors enrolled in<br />\nsummer session to have a full and successful<br />\nexperience with higher education.<br />\n\u2022 Live and study on the Lake Michigan shores for<br />\nthe summer of 1990.<br />\n'Compensation: summer room and board,<br />\nsalary and expenses, one course tuition<br />\nscholarship.<br />\nFor complete job description and application<br />\ninformation, call Elaine Hirschhorn at<br />\n1-800-FINDS NU.<br /><br />\n\"Pre-teen Sex is Teleology\" and<br />\nother creations at Art Showcase<br />\nple told me it was pretty good.

It weighs<br />\nin at two hours and ten minutes<br />\nand, in less time than that,<br />\ntransforms an entertaining work<br />\nof fiction into an exercise in<br />\nwaterlogged boredom.<br />\nYet even as the filmmakers<br />\nfalter, \"Red October\" still<br />\namazes with the sheer ingenuity<br />\nof its plot. Soviet submarine Captain Marko Alexandrovich<br />\nRamius (Sean Connery) violates<br />\nmilitary orders and sends his<br />\nsuper-advanced nuclear submarine hurtling toward friendly<br />\nAmerican ports.<br />\nWhile the United States<br />\nmilitary sweats under the threat<br /><br />\nof imminent nuclear attack, CIA<br />\nanalyst Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin)<br />\nrealizes that what Ramius is in<br />\nfact trying to defect from the<br />\nSoviet Union.

The action<br />\ndashes from the October to<br />\nvarious tracking ships (Soviet and<br />\nAmerican), and then to brief<br />\nstops at the Kremlin and the National Security Council. The<br />\ndense story here probably<br />\ncouldn't be told any other way,<br />\nbut these curt, constant changes<br />\noften grind the film's events to an<br />\nexcruciatingly slow pace. The<br /><br />\nfilm audience (unlike a read<br />\ncan't turn back the pages to<br />\nfingure out what's going on, so<br />\nevery point in \"Red October\" is<br />\n.<br />\nmade very clear.<br />\nIn this instance, clarity leads to<br />\nsimplicity, and \"Red October\"<br />\nadopts a view of international<br />\npolitics that is laughable in scope<br />\nand dangerously distorted. Policy<br />\ndeliberations degenerate into sitcom side shows, and the United<br />\nStates government is run by savvy slickers who pull fast ones<br />\nover on their dimwitted Soviet<br />\ncounterparts.<br />\nIt would be wrong to reveal the<br />\nfilm's ending, but it doesn't take<br />\nan audience of rocket scientists to<br />\nfigure it out. \"Red October\" may<br />\nbe set before perestroika, but that<br />\ndoesn't stop a few good Russians<br />\nfrom admitting the sins of their<br />\nways and kneeling before the<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nby Paul Bonanos<br />\nMUSIC<br />\nPianist Joel Wizansky will be<br />\nplaying Beethoven's \"Piano Concerto No. 1\" at Shriver Hall Sunday at 3 p.m. Subsequently, the<br />\nHopkins Symphony Orchestra<br />\nwill be playing Hanson's \"Symphony No. 2 ( 'Romantic' ).\"<br />\nThe HSO will be conducted by<br />\nHarvey Selder.

Opening with<br />\n\"Deep Fascination\" from their<br />\n1988 \"Only Life\" LP, the band<br /><br />\nblistered its way through a<br />\nfifteen-song set of originals and<br />\ncovers. Their trademark,<br />\ninstantly identifiable sound,<br />\ncharacterized by strong twoguitar interplay and winding feedback leads over brittle electric<br />\nstrumming, highlighted impressive renditions of \"Loveless<br />\nLove,\" from 1980's scarce<br />\n\"Crazy Rhythms\" album , and<br />\n\"Higher Ground,\" from \"Only<br />\nLife.\"<br />\nBut it was \"Slipping (into<br />\nsomething),\" a 1986 original<br />\nmusically reminiscent of the<br />\nVevet Underground's \"Heroin,\"<br />\nthat truly ignited the set. Building<br />\nfrom a quiet, simple riff over<br />\nsome spare percussion from<br />\ndrummers Stanley Demeski and<br />\nDave Weckerman, a sudden acceleration brought the song to its<br /><br />\nMOVIES<br /><br />\n'Hunt for Red October'<br />\nPractically Begs to Be<br />\nPut out of Its Misery<br />\nMOVIES, from 8<br />\nstoicism are intended to belie a<br />\nmonumental struggle, mano a<br />\nmano.

What re-<br /><br />\nfrenzied climax, with guitarists<br />\nBill Million and Glenn Mercer<br />\nstrumming with such furious intenstity that strings were breaking left and right. This was<br />\nfollowed by the brilliant almosthit \"Away,\" which received<br />\nenough college radio airplay to be<br />\nrecognized by neophyte fans. A<br />\ncover of the Rolling Stones'<br />\n\"Paint It, Black\" also incited<br />\nsome unwelcome but thankfully<br />\nnon-violent slamdancing in the<br />\ngeneral admission crowd.<br />\nAs if the excitement had not<br />\nbeen enough, a rendition of<br />\n\"Crazy Rhythms,\" with Million<br />\nand Mercer joining in spirited<br />\nharmonies, and an overwhelming<br />\nstop-start cover of Neil Young's<br />\n\"Sedan Delivery\" ended the set.<br />\nA series of encores followed, including \"I'm A Believer\" and the<br />\nBeatles' White Album chestnut<br />\n\"Everybody's Got Something To<br />\nHide Except Me and My<br />\nMonkey.\" At this point percussionist Dave Weckerman went to<br />\nthe stage's front and tapped out<br />\nrhythms on a suspended metal<br />\nbar. When the bar fell midway<br /><br />\nThis week at The<br /><br />\nthrough the song and hung from<br />\nits stand by just a single strand of<br />\nwire, Weckerman valiantly dropped to his knees to continue,<br />\nsmacking the bar against a wall<br />\nfor some unique sound effects.<br />\nThe Feelies further revealed some<br />\nof their musical influences with<br />\na supercharged cover of the<br />\nVelvet Underground's \"What<br />\nGoes On,\" as Glenn Mercer's<br />\nenergetic Lou Reed-like singing<br />\nand Bill Million's ringing rhytm<br />\nguitar powered the song to its<br />\nend.<br />\nAs the band packed up after the<br />\nshow, they welcomed fans onto<br />\nthe stage, discussing everything<br />\nfrom downtown clubs to drum<br />\ncymbals. Asked if another album<br />\nwas due to be released soon,<br />\ndrummer Stan Demeski said,<br />\n\"Not too soon.. we toured a lot<br />\nafter [\"Only Life\"]; we're taking our time.\" Many fans were<br />\nimpressed by the band's terse wit<br />\nand surprising accessibility.

AIDS, the demand for a<br />\nbetter health care system, and the<br />\ndevelopment of new technology<br />\nhas placed a heavy burden on the<br />\nAmerican pocketbook. Physicians practice with fear of being<br />\nsued for malpractice and the<br />\nmany potential physicians decide<br />\nto pursue a career demanding less<br />\ntime and money.<br />\nIn the January 18, 1990 issue<br />\nof the New England Journal of<br />\nMedicine, Timothy Johnson,<br />\nmedical journalist for ABC<br />\nNews, wrote two articles that expressed his concern for the<br />\nprofession.<br />\nmedical<br />\nthat<br />\nbelieves<br />\nHe<br />\nchanging medicine from a<br />\nbusiness profession back into a<br />\nmedical<br />\nprofession<br />\nwill<br />\nameliorate the lack of trust between doctors and their patients.<br />\nBelow are excerpts from his<br />\nletters.<br />\n\"Dear Medical Consumers:<br />\n. . . Some practitioners had<br />\ntaken advantage of the enormous<br />\nfreedom and power of a physician's licence to practice with arrogance and charge with greed.<br />\nIt was therefore inevitable that the<br />\npublic\u2014through its representatives, the politicians\u2014would<br />\nreact to the highly visible excesses of physicians who took advantage of a system in which the<br />\ndoctor was supreme and could<br /><br />\n\"Today, young<br />\ndoctors often<br />\nreach the end of<br />\ntheir training with<br />\na debt of $50,000<br />\nto $100,000...\"<br />\nliterally write his own ticket . . .<br />\n\"Today, young doctors often<br />\nreach the end of their training<br />\nwith a debt of $50,000 to<br />\n$100,000 that they must pay out<br />\nof relatively low earnings. They<br />\nface a professional life that includes a public and lawyers eager<br />\nto sue, administrators in the<br />\npublic and private sectors eager<br />\nto control, and worst of all, patients eager to be suspicious of<br />\ntheir doctor's ability and<br />\nmotivation.<br />\n\"Many doctors have told me<br />\nthat when a new patient walks in<br />\nthe door, their first thoughts are<br />\ndirected not to finding out what<br />\nis wrong and how to help but<br />\nrather to wondering whether this<br />\nis another patient likely to bring<br />\nsuit.<br />\n\"Please do not misunderstand<br />\nmy purpose in alerting you to the<br />\nanxiety that is developing among<br />\ndoctors. Any profession with<br />\npower over our lives requires<br />\nsensible monitoring and public<br />\nscrutiny . .. But if we go so far<br />\nas to make our physicians sick at<br />\nheart, we do ourselves no favor<br />\nwhen the time comes for us to<br />\nseek their help.\"<br />\n\"Dear Doctors:<br />\nDoctors, of course, have good<br />\nreasons to expect high incomes:<br />\nthe long and arduous training, the<br />\nemotional and physical demands<br />\nof practice, the value of the services offered. But medical consumers, although able intellectually to acknowledge such<br />\narguments, find it hard to accept<br />\nthat they should pay for<br />\nsomething they did not want or<br />\nthat anyone should make large<br />\nprofits from their misery.<br />\n\"Therefore, I have come to<br />\nbelieve that for the medical profession to preserve the public<br />\ntrust, it is critical for doctors to<br />\nbe studious and scrupulous in<br />\navoiding any and all financial<br />\nconflicts of interest. I believe that<br />\nwe should henceforth be encouraging the development of<br />\nnongovernmental practice arrangements based on salaries for<br />\nphysicians, rather than fees.<br />\n\"The financial environment<br /><br />\nshould consist of a salary well<br />\nabove the national average [from<br />\n$90,000 to $100,000 starting<br />\nsalaries with opportunities to advance to $200,000. And for those<br />\nwho believe that doctors should<br />\nhave the right to make much<br />\nmore, like some business executives they know, I would<br />\nsimply suggest that they go into<br />\nbusiness]. I would also argue that<br />\nthe salaries in all specialities<br />\nshould be very similar, with<br />\nvariation allowed only to account<br />\nfor cost-of-living factors, number<br />\nof hours worked (especially at<br />\nnight and on weekends), and<br />\nother differences in effort. This<br />\nshould allow doctors to choose<br />\nspecialties purely for reasons of<br />\ninterest and suitability, not<br />\nbecause of financial incentives. I<br />\nwould also stress the critical importance of eliminating financial<br />\nincentives from the opposite<br />\ndirection, such as placing of<br />\npressure on doctors to save<br />\nmoney by doing less for patients<br />\nthan medical judgment would<br />\notherwise dictate. Finally, we<br />\nshould include building in incentives for patients to avoid unnecessary risks or demands.\"<br />\nThe publication of these two<br />\nletters sparked many comments<br />\nfrom the medical community.<br />\nNorman Anderson, chairman of<br />\nadmissions at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Medicine, found the article to be too superficial. \"What<br />\ndoes Dr. Johnson want this country to do? He wants everybody to<br />\nguarantee doctors honor and<br />\ntrust, almost an open debit drawing on the checkbook from society, giving every doctor a<br />\nsizeable salary. He believes that<br />\nthis in itself will solve the problem of society.<br />\n\"He's failing to address a<br />\nmuch broader issue: the structure<br />\nof the health system, the burdens<br />\nOf where we are in dealing with<br />\nInequities of physician distributions, inequities of distributions<br />\nof specialties and sub-specialties<br />\ncare.<br />\n'The American Medical<br />\nAssociation has also done studies<br />\nto show that doctors' earnings<br />\nhave gone down in the past<br />\nseveral years. Health care costs<br />\ncontinue to rise, unresponsive to<br />\ninflation or anything else. The<br />\nreasons, by in large, are the administrative bureaucratic components that have nothing to do<br />\nwith taking care of the sick, but<br />\nare the billing, the re-billing, the<br />\nauditing, the validation, the oversight of the procedure. They have<br />\nclear evidence there is already<br />\nthis tremendous bureaucracy of<br />\nnon-workers who are really adding to the cost of today's health<br />\ncare.\"<br />\nAll the physicians I interviewed agreed that an improved health<br />\ncare system is of utmost importance. Most of them do not<br />\nbelieve the government is doing<br />\nenough to alleviate the financial<br />\nburden that the American people<br />\nwill have to shoulder in the near<br />\nfuture.<br />\nThis concern and many others<br />\nwere.addressed on February 11,<br />\n1990, at a symposium held at the<br />\nGlass Pavilion. Topics such as<br />\n\"Sustaining Ethical Values in<br />\nMarket Place Medicine,\"<br />\n\"Health Care Dilemmas in the<br />\nThird World,\" and \"The Impact<br />\nof Social Problems Upon Doctors\" provided a basis in which<br />\nthe public can see what change<br />\nhas taken place in the field of<br />\nmedicine. One physician commented that a doctor these days<br />\nhas two responsibilities: one to<br />\nheal the sick and the other to<br />\ndirect the government into providing a system and financial support that will benefit the health of<br />\nAmericans.<br />\nIt is then not a wonder that<br />\nmany students these days have<br />\nturned away from the field of<br />\nmedicine. Many have turned<br />\naway from medicine because they<br />\nbelieve it not worth the years of<br />\narduous training and the enormous debt when they are done.<br />\nJohn Gryder, pre-med auviser,<br />\nbelieves that \"many people in<br />\nmedicine have forgotten that it is<br />\na service profession. They are<br />\nlooking for monetary rewards and<br />\nthese types of people are not appropriate for a profession in<br /><br />\nwhich people expect them to<br />\nmake sacrifices.\"<br />\nReverend Clyde Shallenberger,<br />\none of the speakers at the medical<br />\nsympositim, concurred with<br />\nGryder's comment. \"If money is<br />\nthe primary motivation that drives<br />\na student to medicine, then the<br />\nworld is better off not having him<br />\nin medicine.\"<br />\nMany of the physicians including William Greenough, who<br />\nspent many years helping the<br />\nelderly in Bangladesh, and Jerry<br />\nReardon, who gave a speech concerning the social problems faced by doctors, believe the<br />\ndecrease in medical school applicants a positive change.<br />\nGreenough remarked, \"The<br />\ndecrease in medical applicants<br />\nwill extract the students who are<br />\nnot really right for the medical<br />\nprofession.\"<br />\nGryder spoke on the same lines<br />\nabout Hopkins' pre-meds: \"In all<br />\nhonesty, I.think the decrease in<br />\nthe number of applicants is good.<br />\nI see medical schools taking<br />\nstudents that they wouldn't have<br />\ntaken in the past because their<br />\ngrades weren't quite as high. You<br />\ndon't have to be a genius to be a<br />\ngood doctor. Getting 4.0 in<br />\nscience courses is not a requirement for medical school. Because<br />\nthe applicant pool is changing,<br />\n[admissions officers] are more<br />\ncareful in looking at other<br />\ncharacteristics. Because of this<br />\nthey are getting more students<br />\nthat are suitable for the profession.\"<br />\nAnother important question<br /><br />\nWELLNESS<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nNATIONAL COLLEGIATE DRUG AWARENESS<br />\nWEEK ACTIVITIES<br /><br />\nMONDAY, MARCH 5<br />\nKICK-OFF SPEAKER<br /><br />\nCAROLINE MILLER<br />\nauthor of<br /><br />\nMy Name Is Caroline<br />\nA graduate of Harvard, Caroline Miller will tell<br />\nof her seven years as a bulimic<br />\nand her recovery from addictions.<br />\nGLASS PAVILION<br />\n12 noon - 1 p.m.<br />\nRefreshments provided<br /><br />\n*******************************<br /><br />\nTUESDAY, MARCH 6<br />\nWELLNESS DAY<br />\nCARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENT<br /><br />\nAre you at risk for heart disease?<br />\nDo you know what your cholesterol level is<br />\nor<br />\nshould be?<br /><br />\n(cholesterol, blood pressure, stress,<br />\ncarbon dioxide screening)<br /><br />\nfor all<br />\nFACULTY, STAFF and STUDENTS<br />\nCost: $5.00<br />\nGLASS PAVILION<br />\n10 a.m. - 2 p.m.<br /><br />\n\"If money is the<br />\nprimary motivaCall 8271 for an assessment appointment (especially if<br />\nBe HEART SMART<br />\nneeded during the noon hour) or stop by the Class<br />\ntion that drives a<br />\nPavilion between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.<br />\nCosponsored by the Student Health Clinic.<br />\nstudent to<br />\nmedicine, then the<br />\nworld is better'off<br />\nnot having him in<br />\nmedicine.\"<br />\n*******************************<br />\ne<br /><br />\nposed at the symposium was<br />\nwhether American medical<br />\nschools are training students<br />\nenough to fit the needs of society. Gryder responded,\"I do have<br />\nsome problems with medical<br />\nschool training. There are a lot of<br />\ndifferent kinds of physicians that<br />\nare needed, and what we have<br />\ndeveloped is a single route for<br />\neverybody. I don't think it's<br />\npossible to clearly lay some common ground with such a wide<br />\nrange of specialties in medicine.<br />\nI really don't see why a<br />\npsychiatrist has to go through the<br />\nfour years that an oral surgeon<br />\ndoes. I also think that med<br />\nschools overemphasize the<br />\ntechnology and science of<br />\nmedicine and have not emphasized the human aspects to it<br />\nenough.\"<br />\nContrary to the pessimistic opinion of Timothy Johnson, many<br />\ndoctors believe that the American<br />\npublic still reveres the medical<br />\nfield. Reardon says, \"I think that<br />\nmany medical consumers still<br />\nhave an enormously positive attitude towards physicians.\" As<br />\none physician remarked, \"Those<br />\n[doctors] that have the three<br />\nJaguars in the driveway, et<br />\ncetera, et cetera, make the press,<br />\nbut the physicians who are in the<br />\ntrenches doing the important<br />\nwork, but not the kind of work<br />\nthat gives them a lot of popularity or even necessarily an excessive amount of income (i.e.<br />\ngoing to Bangladesh like Dr.<br />\nGreenbough, going to Nigeria<br />\nlike Dr. Henry Mosely), you<br />\ndon't read in the newspaper.

While<br />\nmany Marylanders might think<br />\n\"lacrosse\" would be a better<br />\nanswer, jousting remains the<br />\nstate sport of Maryland,<br />\ndespite a recent attempt by<br />\nlacrosse advocates to give<br />\nlacrosse at least a share of<br />\njousting's title.<br />\nUnder pressure from State<br />\nSenate President Thomas<br />\n\"Mike\" Millc'. (D-Prince<br />\nGeorges County), supporters<br />\nof a bill proposing to designate<br />\nlacrosse the state team sport<br />\ndecided not to introduce it for<br />\nconsideration by the legislature<br />\nthis year. The bill, sponsored<br />\nby State Sen. Frank Kelly(DBaltimore County), would retain jousting as the state individual sport.<br />\nAccording to John Stude,<br />\none of the bill's chief supporters, Miller urged him and<br />\nKelly to wait until next year's<br />\nsession of the state legislature<br />\nto introduce the bill, due to the<br />\nlarge backlog of critical issues<br />\nfacing the legislature, such as<br />\ndrugs, education and the<br />\nbudget.<br />\nIn spite of this delay, Stude<br />\nremained undeterred. \"I'll<br />\nkeep proposing it until the day<br />\nI die,\" said Stude, who is<br />\npresident of Pridemaster Inc.,<br />\na Baltimore marketing and<br />\nadvertising firm, and whose<br />\nfather, Fritz Stude, played for<br />\nJohns Hopkins from 1928 to<br />\n1932.<br />\nBut this setback is only the<br />\nlatest in a series that lacrosse<br />\nand its devotees in Maryland<br />\nhave had to suffer since 1962,<br />\nwhen Gov. J. Millard Tawes<br />\nsigned a bill making jousting<br />\nMaryland's first state sport.<br />\nAlthough at that time lacrosse<br />\nwas already considerably<br />\npopular, Tawes claimed that<br />\nthe uniqueness of jousting<br />\nwould help spur tourists' interest in Maryland.<br />\nIfjousting had any effect on<br />\ntourism in Maryland is undocumented, but the years<br />\nsince then have seen interest in<br />\nlacrosse both in Maryland and<br />\nacross the nation increase<br />\ndramatically. Last year's<br />\nNCAA Division I men's<br />\nlacrosse championship game<br />\nbetween Johns Hopkins and<br />\nSyracuse drew 23,893 spectators to the University of<br />\nMaryland at College Park.<br />\nBut jousting supporters in<br />\nMaryland, made up of the approximately fifty members of<br /><br />\nthe Maryland Tournament<br />\nJousting Association, have<br />\nproved to be formidable opponents in the state government, although both Gov.<br />\nWilliam Donald Schaefer and<br />\nBaltimore Mayor Kurt<br />\nSchmoke played lacrosse at<br />\nCity College in Baltimore, and<br />\nthe latter also at Yale<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nAttempts to change the<br />\nnomenclature of the 1962 bill<br />\nby State Del. William J.<br />\nBurkhead (D-Anne Arundel<br />\nCounty) were voted down in<br />\nboth 1980 and 1982. More<br />\nrecently, a 1988 bill also sponsored by Kelly proposing to<br />\ncompletely replace jousting<br />\nwith lacrosse as the state sport<br />\nnever even received enough<br />\nvotes in a hearing by the House<br />\nConstitutional and Administrative Law Committee to<br />\nbecome introduced into the<br />\nlegislature.<br />\nOne of the reasons for the<br />\nstate government's opposition<br />\nto lacrosse is the conception a<br />\nlarge number of state<br />\nlegislators hold that lacrosse is<br />\nan excessively violent sport.<br />\n\"It's the closest thing to<br />\ncontrolled murder that I know<br />\nof,\" said Montgomery County Council President William<br />\nHanna in a Jan. 25 article in<br />\nthe Washington Post. Added<br />\nHanna, \"I never think of<br />\nMaryland as having anything<br />\nto do with lacrosse.\"<br />\nMany lacrosse supporters<br />\nfeel, however, that this is a<br /><br />\nmisrepresented and misinformed conception of lacrosse,<br />\nmost likely due to the advertisements for and image surrounding the Major Indoor<br />\nLacrosse League (MILL).<br />\nTeams in the MILL play box<br />\nlacrosse, a hybrid between<br />\nlacrosse and ice hockey, which<br />\nis promoted as being extremely<br />\nviolent.<br />\n\"I have a big beef against<br />\nthe whole sport because that is<br />\nthe one segment of lacrosse<br />\nthat is receiving some television time, airing time, advertising time, and all they show<br />\nare guys running into each<br />\nother . . . it's definitely different than field lacrosse,\"<br />\nsaid Johns Hopkins men's<br />\nlacrosse coach Don Zimmerman. \"And I in no way support or will ever support that<br />\nsport.\"<br />\nAnother reason for opposition from many state<br />\nlegislators to making lacrosse<br />\nthe state sport is the time and<br />\nmoney which must be spent by<br />\nthe state government in passing and putting into effect a bill<br />\nwhich, in the eyes of many,<br />\nhas no consequence.<br />\nLacrosse supporters respond, however, that if the state<br />\nhad time and money to make<br />\njousting the state sport in 1982,<br />\nit should have the time and<br />\nmoney in 1990 to also<br />\nrecognize lacrosse.<br />\n\"Issues which concern you<br />\nand me like drugs are definitely more important (than<br /><br />\nlacrosse], but this world goes<br />\naround largely because of<br />\nthings which 'really don't matter,\u2014 said Stude.<br />\nIn addition, the fact that<br />\nmore Maryland high school<br />\nstudents receive college<br />\nscholarships to play lacrosse<br />\nthan any other sport makes<br />\nlacrosse deserving of the state<br />\nsport designation in the eyes of<br />\nmany lacrosse supporters.<br />\n\"I don't think many of these<br />\nkids would be able to joust<br />\ntheir way to college,\" added<br />\nStude.<br />\nWhether or not lacrosse ever<br />\nreceives any form of the state<br />\nsport designation, its supporters feel it will continue to<br />\ngain in popularity and will<br />\nalways be their favorite sport.<br />\n\"I think it would be nice if<br />\nsomehow the state were to<br />\nsomehow recognize lacrosse as<br />\nthe state sport,\" said Zimmerman. \"But lacrosse is not a<br />\nprofessional game, and I think<br />\nthat because it's an amateur<br />\nsport it has retained some of<br />\nthe beauty of sport for sport.\"<br />\n\"The guys who come here<br />\n[to Hopkins] to play lacrosse,<br />\nthey know that they're not going to leave here and sign<br />\nmillion-dollar contracts to play<br />\nprofessional lacrosse,\" added<br />\nZimmerman. \"They play the<br />\nsport for the love of the game.<br />\nAnd to me, that's the essence<br />\nof sports.

A competitive fall season,<br />\nfull of tryouts and challenge matches, produced a confident teen<br />\nof seven upperclassmen and four<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nDespite a losing season a year<br />\nago, senior captain Ryn Iwai<br />\npredicts a dramatic turnaround. In<br />\nmaking this prediction Ryn points<br />\nto several factors which will beg<br />\nfuture success. The only senior to<br />\ngraduate played number 2, and<br />\nwill be replaced at the top by<br />\nRyn, coming off an injury-filled<br />\nseason, and one of the best<br />\nfreshmen classes ever.<br />\nThe addition of new assistant<br />\ncoach Tom McCarthy, who<br />\nworks with top 20 player Jaime<br />\nYzaga, will add vigor and intensity to the team's workouts. After<br />\nthe first practice, McCarthy was<br />\nimpressed with the team's talents<br />\nand looks forward to a competitive and successful season.<br />\nThe tennis lineup is still in<br />\nquestion. Apart from Ryn playing number one, all the positions<br />\nare up in the air. Returning<br />\nplayers Lorin Enquist, last year's<br />\nnumber one player, South<br />\nAfrican Francois Erasmus, Sam<br />\nKim, Jon Missner, Ted Roth and<br />\nTony Sangchompuphen will battle freshmen Bill Braude, Jon<br />\nCohen, Chris Kwon, and Mike<br />\nKim for the remaining six spots<br />\non the traveling roster.<br />\nAfter the lineup begins to take<br />\nform, the team can really begin<br />\npreparations for its toughest<br />\nchallenges: Haverford, perennial<br />\npower Washington College, and<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall.<br />\nThe team opens March 8th at<br />\nhome against Mary Washington<br />\nCollege.<br /><br />\nShould the Jays pull off the<br />\nupset tomorrow, they'll play the<br />\nwinner of Western Connecticut<br />\nand Trenton State University.<br />\nThose teams have combined<br />\nrecords of 47-6. However, it's<br />\nunlikely that the Jays will be looking past he Diplomats. F &amp; M<br />\nhas a very efficient multi-option<br /><br />\nto earn F&amp;M rematch<br /><br />\nmotion offense.<br />\n\"They're an excellent passing<br />\nteam,\" noted Jays assistant coach<br />\nEd Richardson. \"You really have<br />\nto see the ball well against them.<br />\nEach passer has three options,<br />\nand you never know what he's<br />\ngoing to do, so you can't cheat.<br />\nYou have to play honest or else<br />\nthey'll burn you.\" Apparently<br />\nthat is what happened the last time<br /><br />\nAfter losing to F &amp; M, the .1'.iys<br />\nHopkins visited F &amp; M.<br />\n\"We shot about 20 percent, we were 10-6 and faced an uphill<br />\ncouldn't pass, and we couldn't set climb to play in the post-srason.<br />\na pick. It was the worst game They had a team meeting in<br />\nwe've played since I've been which they discussed the role that<br />\nhere,\" said Enfield. \"We went . each player was expected to play.<br />\nin scared and we played scared,\" Since then the Jays are 8-1. \"We<br />\nsaid Jones. \"But we want this just gelled after that,\" said<br />\nEnfield.<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nEven should Hopkins lose, they<br />\ncan look back on a great season.<br /><br />\nFencers take 2nd,3rd<br />\nSTAB, from 13<br />\nfirst. That slim hope was dashed<br />\nimmediately as NYU won the<br />\nfirst two bouts of the round.<br />\nBrandeis defeated Chicago<br />\n(17-10), and a second-place finish<br />\nwas still possible, but only with<br />\na sweep of the final seven bouts.<br /><br />\nThis was not the Jays' day,<br />\nhowever, as they lost the next<br />\nbout. The final score was 17-10.<br />\nThe Blue Jays fared better in<br />\nthe individual competition. 10 of<br />\n12 Hopkins fencers qualified for<br />\nthe competition, with four<br />\nreaching the finals. Junior Tim<br />\nTrain won the title in epee, improving on last season's second-<br /><br />\nplace finish. Sophomore Jorge<br />\nGana finished fifth, also in epee.<br />\nJunior Rob McLay took fifth in<br />\nsabre, finishing behind four NYU<br />\nfencers.

It has been fun to watch<br />\nthese young ladies, my first two<br />\nrecruiting classes, develop as<br />\npeople as well as players. This<br />\nyear's team certainly left its mark<br />\non the history books.<br />\nWith no seniors graduating, the<br />\nentire team will be returning next<br />\nyear. Blank hopes that a good<br />\nrecruiting class will add even<br />\nmore depth to her team: \"We<br />\nneed more power inside, so we're<br />\nlooking to bring in a dominant<br />\npower forward/center. We would<br />\nalso like a backup point guard to<br />\ngive us more depth and help take<br />\nsome of the pressure off Juliane<br />\nand Tracy.\"<br />\nThe Jays could also be helped<br />\nby the return ofJen Luzietti, who<br />\nstarted at center before injuring<br />\nher knee early in the season.<br />\nLuzietti had reconstructive<br /><br />\nSaturday<br /><br />\nWomen's Swimming \u2022 Thursday<br />\n- Saturday<br /><br />\nsurvery on the knee and anticipates returning next year after<br />\nintense rehabilitation in the offseason. \"Jen is a steady, reliable<br />\nimpact player that can quietly hurt<br />\nan opponent,\" said Blank. \"We<br />\nhope to have her back next year.\"<br />\nThe Jays hope to open next<br />\nseason with their own four-team<br />\ntournament.

Special thanks to<br />\nall the News-Letter staff and<br />\nespecially to Mom and Dad.<br /><br />\nYouth is the key. Six of the<br />\nstarters from last year's<br />\nfinalists are gone. Four of<br />\nthem were All-Americans.<br />\nOne of them was Dave<br />\nPietramala. Pietramala was the<br />\nDivision I Player of the Year,<br />\nbut he was even better than<br />\nthat. Pietramala may well play<br />\nthe best lacrosse in the world.<br />\nEnter a new era for Blue Jay<br />\nlacrosse. Fourteen of the 39<br />\nplayers on the 1990 roster are<br />\nfreshmen. Eleven others have<br />\nvery limited game experience.<br />\nDon't call it a rebuilding<br />\nyear, though. Five Allto<br />\nreturn<br />\nAmericans<br />\nHomewood, including college<br />\nlacrosse's best goalie. The<br />\ntalent goes far beyond the five<br />\nand the potential for a trip to<br />\nRutgers on Memorial Day is<br />\ndefinitely there.<br />\n\"We're a younger team than<br />\nlast year overall, and less experienced,\" says Coach Don<br />\nZimmerman, who in this<br />\nseason of youth became a<br />\nfather on Tuesday morning.<br />\nYou could look at the team's<br />\nyouth as detrimental, but as far<br />\nas the enthusiasm they've<br />\nshown, they have more than<br /><br />\nmade up for the inexperience.<br />\nThat's what is going to carry<br />\nus through the first half of the<br />\nseason. Then we'll have experience and that will help us<br />\nthrough the rest.\"<br />\nGoal<br />\nCertainly the strongest<br />\naspect of the 1990 Jays is the<br />\nlast line of defense. Since he<br />\nemerged as a starter midway<br />\nthrough his freshman year, cocaptain Quint Kessenich has<br />\nbeen the nation's top<br />\ngoaltender. He has been a firstteam All-American the past<br />\ntwo seasons, and has continued<br />\nto improve throughout his<br />\ncareer. Now a senior, he appears prepared for his finest<br />\ncampaign. Kessenich has the<br />\nability to dominate a game. His<br />\nconfidence and outstanding<br />\njudgement would benefit any<br />\nteam, especially a young one<br />\nsuch as the Jays.<br />\nKessenich's responsibilities<br />\nhave changed this season,<br />\nthough, and he must prove his<br />\nability to respond to a new<br />\nrole. For his first three<br />\nseasons, Kessenich had the<br />\ntremendous luxury of playing<br /><br />\nbehind one of the greatest<br />\ndefensemen in the history of<br />\nthe sport. \"Dave was such a<br />\npresence,\" said Zimmerman,<br />\n'not just Quint, but anyone<br />\nwould miss having him out<br />\nthere.'<br />\nFrom covering the opponent's top offensive player to<br />\ncontaining fast breaks to<br />\nclears,<br />\nquarterbacking<br />\nPietramala led the Blue Jays on<br />\ntheir half of the field. Now,<br />\nto<br />\nlooks<br />\nZimmerman<br />\nKessenich to captain the<br />\ndefense, and Zimmerman<br />\nbelieves the senior is ready to<br />\nassume this leadership:In fact,<br />\nZim expects the responsibility to make Kessenich an even<br />\nmore dominant force.<br />\nseason,<br />\nthis<br />\nAgain<br />\nsophomores Scott Giardina<br />\nand Ian Hobbs will back up<br />\nKessenich.<br />\nClose Defense<br />\nNo team can lose Pietramala<br />\nand not suffer a drop in the<br />\nability of the close defense.<br />\nAdd the loss of Greg Lilly, a<br />\nsecond-team All-American<br />\ndespite missing half the season<br />\nwith a knee injury, and of<br /><br />\nCover photo by David Preece<br /><br />\n27th and Howard St.<br />\n467-7188<br /><br />\nLACROSSE<br />\nPARTY<br />\nOne Free Keg<br />\nafter each home<br />\ngame!<br />\n3333 North Charles Street<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\n243-8844<br /><br />\n$2.00 off Pizza<br /><br />\nAny 16\" w/2 or<br />\nmore toppings.<br /><br />\n$1.00 off Pizza<br />\nAny 12\" w/2 or<br />\nmore toppings<br /><br />\nLACROSSE '90/3<br /><br />\nYouthful, potent team enters '90s<br />\nSteve Ciccarone, a top crease<br />\ndefenseman, and most teams<br />\nwould have rather low expectations for its defense.

Dwan begins this season<br />\non the close unit, and the expectations for the junior are<br />\neven higher. He has the potential to develop into the best<br />\ndefenseman in college<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nThe list of experienced close<br />\ndefenders ends there, leaving<br />\nthe need for someone to step<br />\nin at the third spot. \"Crease<br />\ndefense was one of our big<br />\nquestions,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\nThe answer appears to be<br />\nsophomore Nick Shevillo.<br />\n\"Nick set his sights on it in the<br />\nfall and worked hard at it. I'm<br /><br />\nvery pleased with his play. He<br />\nis one of our pleasant surprises,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\nMichael<br />\nFreshman<br />\nWohltmann, an alternate in last<br />\nseason's North-South High<br />\nSchool All-Star Game, will be<br />\nthe first close defenseman off<br />\nthe bench.<br /><br />\nreduction in long sticks,<br />\nDefensive Midfield<br />\nJuniors Brian Voelker and McNealey has switched to<br />\nJamie McNealey return to lead short-stick rope, a position<br />\na potent rope unit.

The third<br />\ncollege ranks. Because of the member of last year's rope,<br /><br />\nPat Russell, has graduated,<br />\nand two capable freshmen,<br />\nSteve McMahon and Tom<br />\nSullivan, have become the<br />\nfront-runners for his shortstick spot. Rob Burke, also a<br />\nfreshman, will spell Voelker at<br />\nlong-stick when needed.<br />\nRounding out the defensive<br />\ntroops are senior Dave<br />\nHowland, junior Ross Henshaw, and freshman Allen<br />\nWatts. Howland missed last<br />\nseason with knee problems and<br />\nis still on the road to recovery.<br />\n\"He's in a feeling-out process<br />\nof what he can do and what he<br />\ncan't do,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\n\"It's hard to come back from<br />\na knee injury. He needs time<br />\nto gain confidence with the injury.\" If able to return to<br />\nprevious form, Howland could<br />\nmake a significant contribution<br />\nto the team. Henshaw and<br />\nWatts, the son of UMBC<br />\ncoach Dick Watts, both lack<br />\nexperience but provide<br />\nnecessary depth.<br />\nMidfield<br />\nThree of last year's top six<br />\nmiddies are gone, but the Jays<br /><br />\nSee JOSH LAX, II<br /><br />\nYerNe<br />\ngisytioNE<br />\ndslighsima<br /><br />\nEVERPOCKET<br /><br />\nove<br /><br />\n25%<br />\nOFF<br />\nALL LACROSSE,'\"<br />\nBASEBALL AND<br />\nSOFTBALL EQUIPMENT<br /><br />\nTDM Lacrosse<br /><br />\nField Tested &amp;<br />\nNCAA Approved<br /><br />\nBRINE\"\u2022/771fre \u2022 RAWLINGS<br /><br />\nSTX\u2022\u2022Witson \u2022MIZUNO<br />\nLOUISVILLE\u2022 EASTON \u2022 DUDLEY<br /><br />\nEARLY BIRD SPECIALS ON ALL SHOES Cr CLEATS<br /><br />\n'10\u00b0' OFF<br />\nADULT SIZES<br /><br />\nadiCias<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe Only Replaceable<br />\nTraditional Lacrosse Pocket!<br />\nFits All Standard Size Heads.<br /><br />\n'500 OFF<br />\nYOUTH SIZES<br /><br />\nlIbi MIZUNO\u2022MITRE<br />\nALL TEAM UNIFORMS &amp; EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE<br />\nAT GREAT SAVINGS<br />\n(Sale thru April 30,1990)<br /><br />\nTWO LOCATIONS TO SERVE YOU<br /><br />\nIf your stick breaks or you want to try a different style<br />\nhead, it takes just minutes to unbutton your EverPocket and place it in a new head!

Will Syracuse win a<br />\nthird consecutive national title?<br />\nCan Johns Hopkins bring the<br />\nchampionship back to<br />\nHomewood? Is it possible that<br />\nsomeone else will prevent<br />\nanother meeting between the<br />\nOrange and Blue Jays?<br />\nI can tell you that in the<br />\ntight-knit small world of col<br />\nlege lacrosse it is just about impossible for a new kid to crash<br />\nthe big party and come away<br />\nwith a natianal championship.<br />\nIn 1990, expect the usual contenders and pretenders for the<br />\ntitle to compete for NCAA<br />\ntournament bids and the Final<br />\nFour at Rutgers, May 26-28.<br />\nThere are five teams\u2014<br />\nSyracuse, Hopkins, North<br />\nCarolina, Loyola, and<br />\nVirginia\u2014with the talent to<br />\nwin the championship. What<br />\nwill determine the champion is<br />\nwhich team peaks at the right<br />\ntime and has the dominant<br />\nplayer that can take control of<br />\na game at crunch time.<br />\nAfter this group there are<br />\napproximately a dozen teams<br />\nin contention for the seven remaining tournament berths.<br />\nWhile several of these teams<br />\nare quite capable of upsetting<br />\nsomeone's trip to the Final<br />\nFour, it is unlikely that any of<br />\nthem have the overall talent to<br />\nstring together a championship<br />\nrun.<br />\nThe following is a closer<br />\nlook at one view of how the<br />\nI2-team NCAA tournament<br />\nfield will be filled in May.<br />\nI. SYRACUSE<br />\nThe Gaits. When lacrosse<br />\npeople talk about Syracuse's<br /><br />\ntwin All-America midfielders,<br />\nGary and Paul Gait, they speak<br />\nin hushed toes as if \"The<br />\nGaits\" were a new street gang<br />\nor an invading horde of barbarians. They are two of the<br />\nfew college lacrosse players<br />\nwith the size and speed of bigtime running backs. Added to<br />\ntheir intimidating physical<br />\npresence, the Gait boys bring<br />\nthe dazzling stick skills honed<br />\nin the box lacrosse leagues of<br />\ntheir native British Columbia.<br />\nAny way you look at it both<br />\nGary and Paul Gait are<br />\noutstanding lacrosse players<br />\nand Syracuse has them to<br />\nspearhead its run-and-gun<br />\noffense.<br />\nHowever, before pronouncing Syracuse national champions let us remember that<br />\nGary and Paul are both human,<br />\nas Dave Pietramala helped<br />\ndemonstrate, and that the<br />\nOrange are forced to field<br />\neight other players. Syracuse's<br />\n\"eight other players\" are pretty good as well.

Expect Wright<br />\nand Lukacz to provide the<br />\nmidfield's offensive power and<br />\nemerge as major players this<br />\nseason. Senior Greg Kelly and<br />\nfreshman Charlie Speno add to<br />\na midfield that has the potential to develop into a stronger<br />\ngroup than in '89.<br />\nThe Blue Jays attack needs<br />\nto reach a higher level of con-<br /><br />\nsistency. Junior Matt Panetta<br />\nis a bona fide star who has the<br />\nability to dominate a game at<br />\ntimes.

Expect Jay<br />\nClarke, Scott Marr, Jeff Wills,<br />\nand Mike Morrissey all to get<br />\na chance to earn a regular spot<br />\nin the lineup.<br />\nThe '90 Blue Jays are<br />\nanother Hopkins team with the<br />\ningredients for a title run in<br />\nplace. Hopkins needs to improve its consistency on offense and have its young<br />\ndefensemen mature quickly in<br />\norder to make plans for<br />\nanother trip to the Final Four.<br />\n3. NORTH CAROLINA<br />\nThe loose and confident Tar<br />\nHeels are one of the most difficult teams in the country to<br />\nfigure out. They often<br />\nunderachieve in the regular<br />\nseason and end up seeded<br />\nlower than their talent deserves<br />\nin the NCAA's. Then UNC<br />\nwill upset a higher seed (such<br />\nas Loyola last season) and<br />\nmake a serious challenge for<br />\nthe championship. The Tar<br />\nHeels should be no easier to<br />\npredict in '90.<br />\nNorth Carolina is once again<br />\na dangerous offensivp team<br />\nwith a world of athletic ability. In addition, the Heels may<br />\nhave a little bit of wounded<br />\npride since they have not<br />\nplayed in a title game since<br />\nwinning the championship in<br />\n1986.

LOYOLA<br />\nThis is the year that Loyola<br />\nproves that it can play with the<br />\nbig boys. Head coach Dave<br />\nCottle may have the most<br />\nbalanced team in the country<br />\nas the Greyhounds return<br />\nseven starters from last year's<br />\nNCAA quarterfinalists. The<br />\nprimary challenge confronting<br />\nLoyola is a mental one; the<br />\nGreyhounds need to win a big<br />\ngame in the tourney and<br />\nbelieve that they belong on the<br />\nfield with the traditional<br />\npowers.<br />\nThe attack lost first-team<br />\nAll-America Mike Ruland, but<br />\nChris Colbeck, Sean Smith,<br />\nand Jim Blanding all have<br />\ntalent. Highly regarded<br />\nfreshman Kevin Beach should<br />\nalso push for serious playing<br />\ntime. The Loyola midfield will<br />\nfeature All-America Brian<br />\nKroneberger. Kroneberger is<br />\na player who could develop into the type of prime-time per-<br /><br />\nformer that a championship<br />\nclub can rely upon. Joining<br />\nKroneberger at midfield will<br />\nbe Kevin Anderson, Ted<br />\nNichols, and Chris Gunkel.<br />\nThe defense is in capable<br />\nhands with honorable mention<br />\nAll-Americas returning in<br />\ngoalie Charlie Toomey and<br />\ndefender Gary Beach. The<br />\nclose defense also welcomes<br />\nback starter Sean Quinn and<br />\nexperienced players Scott<br />\nOslislo and Tom Johnson. The<br />\nlong-stick midfield has senior<br />\nChris McGovern and soph<br />\nDennis Colon available for<br />\nduty.<br />\nOverall the Greyhounds are<br />\nreturning one of the most experienced groups of players in<br />\nthe country and they appear<br />\nready for a push into the bigtime. Inside word has it that<br />\nLoyola has looked very strong<br />\nin preseason scrimmages and<br />\nis focusing on a tough early<br />\nschedule that opens with<br />\nRutgers and Virginia.<br />\nLoyola definitely has the<br />\nability to contend for the<br />\nThe<br />\ncrown.<br />\nNCAA<br />\nGreyhounds need to get a win<br />\nover a top ranked team in the<br />\ntournament so that they can<br />\nbelieve in themselves.<br />\n5. VIRGINIA<br />\nVirginia<br />\nis<br />\nteam<br />\nschizophrenia. In the championship game in '86, then not<br />\neven in the playoffs in '87.<br />\nVirginia knocks off the<br />\nHopkins and goes to the Final<br />\nFour in '88, then does not<br />\nqualify for the playoffs in '89.<br />\nVirginia cannot even decide if<br />\nits nickname is the Cavaliers<br />\nor the Wahoos.<br />\nIf Virginia's recent pattern<br />\nof play holds true to form then<br />\nexpect to see the Cavaliers in<br />\nthe NCAA tournament. Coach<br />\nJim Adams has assembled a<br />\nroster of talent that is the equal<br />\nof any team, even Syracuse.<br />\nHowever, Virginia has not<br />\nbeen able to play together as<br />\na team for an entire season.<br />\nMore than any other championship contender, the<br />\nCavaliers' title hopes depend<br />\nupon their ability to achieve a<br />\nlevel of consistency and good<br />\nteam chemistry.<br />\nVirginia lost only one starter<br /><br />\nfrom the '89 lineup and<br />\nbrought in one of the strongest<br />\nfreshman classes in the country. On attack, seniors Tom<br />\nBurt and Perry Frazer return<br />\nto lead the way. One of the nation's top freshmen, Kevin<br />\nPehlke is the frontrunner to<br />\nnail down the third starting<br />\nposition.<br />\nVirginia's midfield is an embarrassment of riches. Last<br />\nseason's leading scorer Rob<br />\nSchmalz has been moved from<br />\nattack to midfield. Also returning are experienced players<br />\nChris Wakely, Mike Smith,<br />\nGarth Appelt, and Gabby Roe.<br />\nFreshman Drew Fox another<br />\nhighly touted recruit who<br />\nshould receive a great deal of<br />\nplaying time.<br />\nHowever, one of the keys to<br />\nVirginia's success is the health<br />\nof senior midfielder Andy<br />\nKraus. Two years ago Kraus<br />\nwas a first-team All-American.<br />\nLast year he was hampered by<br />\nnagging injuries and missed<br />\npart of the year but was still<br />\nrecognized as an honorable<br />\nmention All-American. When<br />\nAndy Kraus is healthy he is the<br />\nbest face-off man around and<br />\nmaybe the best college lacrosse<br />\nplayer not from Canada. If<br />\nKraus regains his form of two<br />\nyears ago, the Cavaliers may<br />\nhave the offensive force to<br />\nmake a championship run.<br />\nThere is little drop off in<br />\neffort in '90.

The Terps are a tournament team for sure, but a long<br />\nshot for the Final Four.<br />\n7. RUTGERS<br />\nThe Scarlet Knights are a<br />\ntough team that is looking to<br />\nprove something in '90. Last<br />\nseason Rutgers posted a 9-5<br />\nrecord and missed out on the<br />\nNCAA tournament. This year<br />\nthe Scarlet Knights face<br />\npowers Loyola, Hopkins, and<br />\nSyracuse, but the important<br />\ngames may be early against<br />\nNavy and late in the year<br />\nagainst Massachusetts. Navy<br />\nand UMass are likely to be<br />\nteams contending with Rutgers<br />\nin the second half of the top ten<br />\nand wins over them would probably assure a playoff spot.<br />\nRutgers has a lot of talent on<br />\nattack. All-America candidate<br />\nAndy DeCicco heads up an experienced group of attackmen.<br />\nOther returning players to<br />\nwatch are Peter Tortorella and<br />\nSteve Luciano. At midfield,<br />\nthird-team All-America Greg<br />\nRinaldi will be the main gun<br />\nand provide team leadership.<br />\nThe Knights have quality depth<br />\nat midfield including defensive<br />\nmidfielder Chris Wagner.<br />\nThe defense will be solid<br />\nwith returnees Tom Pritts and<br />\nMike Rogers. Junior John<br />\nSchmunk gives Rutgers an experienced goalkeeper to mind<br />\nthe nets.<br />\nRutgers is another team that<br />\noften seems on the verge of<br />\nSee ANDY, 6<br /><br />\nNowl<br /><br />\nANDY, from 5<br />\nbecoming an excellent team<br />\nbut has a tendency to play inconsistently at the wrong<br />\ntimes. The bet here is that<br />\nRutgers puts together a solid<br />\nyear and earns a post-season<br />\ninvitation.<br />\n8. MASSACHUSETTS<br />\nThe Minutemen are a strong<br />\noffensive team returning nine<br />\nstarters but the one loss is a big<br />\none. UMass is without the<br />\npresence of four-time AllAmerica goalie Sal LoCascio.<br />\nLoCascio was the type of<br />\ngoalie that could cover up for<br />\na lot of mistakes and make big<br />\ngames very interesting. If the<br />\nMassachusetts defense can do<br />\nthe job adequately, then expect<br />\nto see the Minutemen in the<br />\ntournament.<br />\nUMass returns two AllAmerica performers on attack<br />\nin Jim McAleavey and Scott<br />\nHiller. Scoring goals will not<br />\nbe a major problem for<br />\nUMass. The midfield is<br />\nheadlined by senior secondteam All-America Tim<br />\nSoudan. Joining Soudan are<br />\nexperienced players in Rob<br />\nCodignotto<br />\nand<br />\nMarc<br />\nFeinberg. The defense will<br />\nhave to bring the level of its<br />\ngame up a notch, led by<br />\nsophomores Rich Mullins and<br />\nMario Lopez.<br />\nHead Coach Dick Garber<br />\nhas announced his retirement<br />\neffective at the end of the<br />\nseason, giving the Minutemen<br />\nsome extra incentive to turn in<br />\ntheir best post-season effort<br />\nthis year. UMass is a team that<br />\ncould definitely spoil someone's plans to go to the<br />\nFinal Four.<br />\n9.
