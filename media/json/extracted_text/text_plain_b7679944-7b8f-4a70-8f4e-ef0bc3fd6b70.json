The orator of the<br />\nday was Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, full<br />\nof years and honors, a literary man<br />\nof note, a poet, a novelist and a<br />\nhistorian, and one of the foremost<br />\nPhysicians of America. Among<br />\nthe guests were the Governor of the<br />\nState, the Mayor of the city, and an<br />\nex-Attorney-General of the United<br />\nStates. An appropriate musical<br />\nProgram was rendered under the<br />\ndirection of Mr. E. L. Turnbull,<br />\nand included numbers played by a<br />\nstring quartette consisting of members of the faculty of the Peabody<br />\nConservatory.<br />\nAfter an opening andante by the<br />\nstring quartette, Mr. J.

A prayer was then offered<br />\nby the chaplain of the day, Rev.<br />\nG. R. Grose, pastor of Grace<br />\nMethodist Episcopal Church, and<br />\nthe president then introduced the<br />\norator.<br />\nFor more than an hour and a<br />\nhalf Dr. Mitchell, although in his<br />\neighty-fourth year, held the unflagging attention of his audience.<br />\n.11is subject was: \"George Washington,\" a theme peculiarly appropriate to the day upon which our<br />\ncommemoration exercises fall and<br />\none upon which the speaker is a<br />\nrecognized authority. He reviewed<br />\nthe various attempts of writers and<br />\nPainters to depict Washington's<br />\ncharacter and endeavored to deduce<br />\nfrom these efforts a still more faithful likeness. He frequently caused<br />\nhearty laughter by humorous anecdotes and side-comment. The address was a model of light, entertaining and yet scholarly discourse.<br />\nAfter Dr. Mitchell had concluded and had received the honorary<br />\ndegree of doctor of laws, Mr.<br />\nGeorge Whitelock, in a few wellchosen words, presented to the<br />\nUniversity a portrait of the late<br />\nProf. Marshall Elliott as a tribute<br />\nfrom his friends.

This may be .a slight reflection on the cleanliness of the<br />\nstudents, but they are hardly to<br />\nblame. They could not reasonably<br />\nbe expected to pay a cent every time<br />\nthey wash their hands during the<br />\ncourse of a day. Therefore, although the machines were ostensibly installed as a sanitary measure,<br />\nthey probably did more harm than<br />\ngood, as many students, who formerly washed their hands while the<br />\nold roller towels were in operation,<br />\nmust have neglected to d6 so 'since<br />\nthe machines were in use, judging<br />\nfrom the fact that very few towels<br />\nwere purchased. Last.week a large<br />\nroll of absorbent paper towels<br />\nwas placed in the cage lavatory,<br />\nwhich may be used without charge.<br />\nThey combine the .advantages of<br />\nbeing sanitary and also free.

Under the present-day circumstances at Hopkins the seniors<br />\nreceive their degrees, shake hands<br />\nwith each other and in such a conventional -way bring their college<br />\ndays to a close. I am persuaded<br />\nthat graduation exercises like this<br />\nare insufficient in themselves. What<br />\nwe need in addition is something.<br />\nin which the class, as a class, takes<br />\npart: in other words, a class-day.<br />\nThen the departure would remain<br />\ntreasured in memory, and the bonds<br />\nof fellowship between class members would be united more closely.<br />\nThe one way a more adequate<br />\ncommencement can be obtained is<br />\nthrough the senior class. It is<br />\nwithin the power of the present<br />\nsenior class to confer on itself and<br />\nfuture generations of students a<br />\ngreat blessing-. Hopkins is waiting<br />\nfor a strong senior class!<br />\nThe cry of \"Wait until we get to<br />\nlomewood\" cannot serve in this<br />\ncase. It is necessary, maybe, to<br />\nare<br />\nwait for 11(Anewood before we<br />\nable to have that college spirit<br />\nwhich collies only with dormitory<br />\nlife ; but any class with initiative<br />\ncould make use of .

At some colleges, the senior class<br />\ngathers on the open field and has<br />\nthe class poem read, the loving cup<br />\npassed, and similar festivities<br />\ncarried out. I lornewood Field, with<br />\nits :surrounding- stands, also affords<br />\nan admirable place for an open-air<br />\nplay.

The orator of the<br />\nday was Dr. S.

Among<br />\nthe guests were the Governor of the<br />\nState, the Mayor of the city, and an<br />\nex-Attorney-General of the United<br />\nStates. An appropriate musical<br />\nProgram was rendered under the<br />\ndirection of Mr. E. L.

He reviewed<br />\nthe various attempts of writers and<br />\nPainters to depict Washington's<br />\ncharacter and endeavored to deduce<br />\nfrom these efforts a still more faithful likeness. He frequently caused<br />\nhearty laughter by humorous anecdotes and side-comment. The address was a model of light, entertaining and yet scholarly discourse.<br />\nAfter Dr. Mitchell had concluded and had received the honorary<br />\ndegree of doctor of laws, Mr.<br />\nGeorge Whitelock, in a few wellchosen words, presented to the<br />\nUniversity a portrait of the late<br />\nProf. Marshall Elliott as a tribute<br />\nfrom his friends.

This may be .a slight reflection on the cleanliness of the<br />\nstudents, but they are hardly to<br />\nblame. They could not reasonably<br />\nbe expected to pay a cent every time<br />\nthey wash their hands during the<br />\ncourse of a day. Therefore, although the machines were ostensibly installed as a sanitary measure,<br />\nthey probably did more harm than<br />\ngood, as many students, who formerly washed their hands while the<br />\nold roller towels were in operation,<br />\nmust have neglected to d6 so 'since<br />\nthe machines were in use, judging<br />\nfrom the fact that very few towels<br />\nwere purchased. Last.week a large<br />\nroll of absorbent paper towels<br />\nwas placed in the cage lavatory,<br />\nwhich may be used without charge.<br />\nThey combine the .advantages of<br />\nbeing sanitary and also free.

Under the present-day circumstances at Hopkins the seniors<br />\nreceive their degrees, shake hands<br />\nwith each other and in such a conventional -way bring their college<br />\ndays to a close.

What<br />\nwe need in addition is something.<br />\nin which the class, as a class, takes<br />\npart: in other words, a class-day.<br />\nThen the departure would remain<br />\ntreasured in memory, and the bonds<br />\nof fellowship between class members would be united more closely.<br />\nThe one way a more adequate<br />\ncommencement can be obtained is<br />\nthrough the senior class. It is<br />\nwithin the power of the present<br />\nsenior class to confer on itself and<br />\nfuture generations of students a<br />\ngreat blessing-. Hopkins is waiting<br />\nfor a strong senior class!<br />\nThe cry of \"Wait until we get to<br />\nlomewood\" cannot serve in this<br />\ncase. It is necessary, maybe, to<br />\nare<br />\nwait for 11(Anewood before we<br />\nable to have that college spirit<br />\nwhich collies only with dormitory<br />\nlife ; but any class with initiative<br />\ncould make use of .

The agreement with the<br />\n\"infantas\" had been that they could<br />\nfight all they wanted to in the banquet hail; but so impressive was<br />\nthe sight of the Class of 1914, as<br />\na whole, that no traces of untoward<br />\ncaprices were visible.<br />\nCopying the seniors, the University Ode was sung as a sort of grace<br />\nbefore sitting down.

Two<br />\nmore toasts were given after this<br />\nby Mr. Sutton and Mr. Catlin.<br />\nMr. Sutton's toast was \"Greene<br />\nGoods\" or \"What's Home Without<br />\nMother?\" This was by far the<br />\nmost amusing speech of the evening, although several of the fellows were seen to start nervously<br />\n(Conlinned on page 6, col. 2.)<br /><br />\nJAMES W.

More bunk. A person would<br />\nthink we had enough colleges already,<br />\nbut it seems like as soon as one is opened<br />\ntip, some gink goes to work and tries to<br />\nopen up another one. This town is rotten with colleges. We got colleges to<br />\nteach doctorin , colleges to teach toothPullin', colleges to teach elocution, colleges to teach lavvyerin'. And what good<br />\ndo they do? Not a darn bit. Nobody<br />\ndon't never get nothing out of 'em.<br />\nThey say this here new johns Hopkins college is to teach engineerin'<br />\nSomething new again! In former times,<br />\nWhen. a young fellow wanted to learn<br />\nengineerin', he went to work and seen<br />\nthe boss down at Mount Clare, and the<br />\nboss put him to work firm' a yard engine, and when he knowed how to shovel<br />\ncoal 0. K. they put him on a' freight<br />\nengine, and then, in two or three years,<br />\nhe was a fireman and getting good wages.<br />\nAnd after that all he had to do was tO<br />\nwait till they needed another engineer,<br />\nand when they needed one they give<br />\nhim the job, and that was all there was<br />\nto it.<br />\n----But now, so they say, an engineer<br />\n,qught to go to college and study geology<br />\nand all that bug stuff, and brush his hair<br />\nstraight back, and go bustin' aroun' in<br />\nOne of them football suits, and play on a<br />\nniandoleen, and stand in a bunch with<br />\nlot of other young muts and holler<br />\n'Rah, rah, rah; ray, ray, ray; icky-acky,<br />\nleky-acky ; bing!\u201d So it seems shovlin'<br />\ncoal has went out of fashion. What they<br />\n, do now is to make a dude outen a young<br />\nfellow\u2014and then give him a engine to<br />\nrun. \u2022 God help the railroads!<br />\nWait till you see the. teachers they hire<br />\nto learn the scholars. You would say<br />\nthe sensible thing to do would be to go<br />\nto work and dig up a couple of engineers<br />\nwho knOwed the business, and then back<br />\nan engine up on the siding and let the<br />\nengineers get into the cab and show the<br />\nscholars how to work the different<br />\nhandles. But I bet you ten to one they<br />\ndon't do nothing of the kind at the Johns<br />\nHopkins.. No, sir. Them roosters does<br />\nthings different.. What they will do is<br />\nto send out for a-bunch . of professors<br />\nWith 0 lot. of .1). D's 'after their names<br />\nand sic 'eni on the scholars.. And all the<br />\ntalk will be in Latin!
