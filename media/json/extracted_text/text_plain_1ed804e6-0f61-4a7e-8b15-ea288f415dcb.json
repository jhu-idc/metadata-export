Princeton University, the University of Maryland, St. John's College and the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University would be required to make a shift of games<br />\nin their present schedules.<br />\nBy the new plan, St. John's would play Princeton on the date that<br />\nHopkins is now scheduled to meet the Tigers, namely May 1 and Hopkins in turn would be ,required to meet Princeton on May 23, the existing date of the Johns Hopkins-University of Maryland game.<br />\nFurthermore our game with the University of Maryland would have<br />\nto be put off until June 6th, a date after the closing of both of the<br />\nUniversities.<br />\nThe St. John's-Johns Hopkins fracas would cake place on May 2,<br />\nthe day following the St. John's-Princeton game.<br />\nIn our estimation, this suggested plan is preposterous and we feel<br />\nthat it would be a very unwise move for all those concerned to adhere to such a suggestion.<br />\nAll this controversy and wrangling could have been avoided if the<br />\nSt. John's College had shown any semblance of cooperation on her<br />\npart when the schedules were being made up.<br />\nAt that time, we offered St. John's these dates, namely the 18th and<br />\n25th of April and the 6th of June. In reply, the Crabtown powers that<br />\nbe, said that the two April dates were not satisfactory purely because<br />\nit was too early in the season to play Hopkins and that the 6th of June<br />\nwas out of the question because they would not be able to put a team<br />\non the field at that date.<br />\nIn return, they offered to us the 2nd of May as the only date that<br />\nthey could meet the Jay twelve. In reviewing the existing situation, the<br />\nHopkins authorities held that it would be unfair to both St. John's and<br />\nPrinceton to accept this date in view of the fact that the Princeton<br />\ngame had been scheduled many months before on Mriday, May 1st.<br />\nWe can see no reason why St. John's did not accept one of the dates<br />\nin April in the first place; but since both of those dates are no longer<br />\nopen and since the only possible date for the St. John's-Hopkins game<br />\nseems to be the 6th of June, we therefore sincerely hope that an agreement to that effect will will soon be reached by the two institutions.<br />\n<br />\nLow Evening<br />\nand Night Rates<br />\nEvening Rates<br />\nBetween 7 P.M. and<br />\n8:30 P.

Princeton University, the University of Maryland, St. John's College and the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University would be required to make a shift of games<br />\nin their present schedules.<br />\nBy the new plan, St. John's would play Princeton on the date that<br />\nHopkins is now scheduled to meet the Tigers, namely May 1 and Hopkins in turn would be ,required to meet Princeton on May 23, the existing date of the Johns Hopkins-University of Maryland game.<br />\nFurthermore our game with the University of Maryland would have<br />\nto be put off until June 6th, a date after the closing of both of the<br />\nUniversities.<br />\nThe St. John's-Johns Hopkins fracas would cake place on May 2,<br />\nthe day following the St. John's-Princeton game.<br />\nIn our estimation, this suggested plan is preposterous and we feel<br />\nthat it would be a very unwise move for all those concerned to adhere to such a suggestion.<br />\nAll this controversy and wrangling could have been avoided if the<br />\nSt. John's College had shown any semblance of cooperation on her<br />\npart when the schedules were being made up.<br />\nAt that time, we offered St. John's these dates, namely the 18th and<br />\n25th of April and the 6th of June. In reply, the Crabtown powers that<br />\nbe, said that the two April dates were not satisfactory purely because<br />\nit was too early in the season to play Hopkins and that the 6th of June<br />\nwas out of the question because they would not be able to put a team<br />\non the field at that date.<br />\nIn return, they offered to us the 2nd of May as the only date that<br />\nthey could meet the Jay twelve. In reviewing the existing situation, the<br />\nHopkins authorities held that it would be unfair to both St. John's and<br />\nPrinceton to accept this date in view of the fact that the Princeton<br />\ngame had been scheduled many months before on Mriday, May 1st.<br />\nWe can see no reason why St. John's did not accept one of the dates<br />\nin April in the first place; but since both of those dates are no longer<br />\nopen and since the only possible date for the St. John's-Hopkins game<br />\nseems to be the 6th of June, we therefore sincerely hope that an agreement to that effect will will soon be reached by the two institutions.<br /><br />\nLow Evening<br />\nand Night Rates<br />\nEvening Rates<br />\nBetween 7 P.M. and<br />\n8:30 P.
