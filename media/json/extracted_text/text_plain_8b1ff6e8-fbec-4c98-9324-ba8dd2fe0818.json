The trio then<br />\nman<br />\nspotted a middle-aged<br />\nsneaking down the alley in the<br />\nshadows and, assuming foulplay, opted to investigate.<br />\nThe team was reduced to a<br />\nmembership of two when Brother O'Connor, overwhelmed with<br />\ntension, tripped in the driveway<br />\nand sprained his ankle.<br />\nWhile Altshuh and Sheridan<br />\ncontinued the chase, a fourth<br />\nbrother, Evan Wilson, spotted<br />\nthe action from a St. Paul Street<br />\nporch and volunteered to notify<br />\nthe authorities. Soon afterward<br />\na half-dozen police cars jammed<br />\nCalvert Alley where Wilson stood<br />\nalone to greet them. Only<br />\nthrough the shrewdest powers of<br />\nnegotiation was Wilson able to<br />\nconvince the officers that they<br />\nwere not victims of a collegiate<br />\nprank.<br />\nThe suspect, who had reached<br />\nGreenmount<br />\nAvenue, sought<br />\nmomentary relief in the restroom of a neighborhood tavern.<br />\nSheridan, considering the temper<br />\nof the establishment, elected to<br />\nwait outside while police arrived<br />\nto apprehend the prowler.<br />\nThe Northern District Police<br />\nand the Ace Elastic bandage<br />\ncompany combined to bring the<br />\nsituation well under control. The<br />\nsuspect claimed that, he had entered the woman's parked car<br />\nlooking \"for a peaceful night's<br />\nrest.\"<br />\nOn Tuesday, October 19 in the<br />\nCounty Court, North Maryland<br />\nDistrict at 9:00 A.M., the suspect<br />\nwas found guilty of vagrancy<br />\nand is currently serving a sixtyday sentence in the city jail.<br />\n<br />\nquest was refused by Robert<br />\nMcCloskey, press officer for the<br />\nState Department, who explained that \"only under such conditions could Dean Rusk be more<br />\nhonest \u2014 or, as we say in the<br />\ncandid.\"<br />\nDepartment,<br />\nState<br />\nDawidowicz and Harding then<br />\nleft, since, according to Dawidowicz, \"We could not in good<br />\nconscience enter under the pretense of keeping quiet, and later<br />\npublicize the discussion.\"<br />\nAlthough it was finely agreed<br />\nupon to send representatives, a<br />\nnumber of SDS members expressed disapproval of the invitation<br />\nat a gathering Thersday of approximately half of the chapter.<br />\nIt was felt that attending the<br />\nclosed session with Rusk might<br />\nbe construed as tacit SDS approval of such seminars, which<br />\nthe organization has strongly<br />\ndenounced.

Perhaps I mistakenly wandered into a Saturday<br />\nmorning economics lecture. In<br />\nany event, the effect was the<br />\nsame; Rusk kept his eyes open<br />\nin deference to the television<br />\ncameras and I in deference to<br />\nthe institution of the State Department. There was real union<br />\nof opinion between Rusk and the<br />\nundergraduate student body on<br />\nSaturday. Both quite obviously<br />\nwished that they had stayed<br />\nhome.<br />\n.The content and form of the<br />\naddress seemed a little like inviting Casey Stengel to speak,<br />\njustifiably supposing that he<br />\nwould discourse on the New<br />\nYork Mets' pennant hopes.

One such is the famous classic which has become<br />\nan automotive legend in its own<br />\ntime, the world famous 1949<br />\nSuper Torque SSK flat head V-8,<br />\nindependent suspension Ford<br />\nDeluxe, sometimes<br />\nRoadster<br />\nknown as the '49 Ford.<br />\nIn order to ,acquaint our readers with the many wonders of<br />\nthis car, it was our rare privilege to drive such a vehicle, since<br />\nonly a few are in existence. This<br />\nwas not a limited production car<br />\nby any means, so the scarcity of<br />\nthe model is accounted to hoarding by collectors and museums,<br />\nas well as scrap metal processing<br />\nconcerns.<br />\nThe first thing one notices<br />\nupon approaching the automobile, besides the smell of oil, is<br />\nthe striking design of the coachwork, and the obvious care with<br />\nwhich the automobile was con-<br />\n<br />\nstructed. On notices that in the<br />\nancient Ford tradition, the body<br />\nhas rotted out in a symmetrical,<br />\nartistically coherent pattern,<br />\ngiving the car great unity of design. The rusted-through areas<br />\nserve to ventilate the passenger<br />\nand engine compartments with a<br />\ncontinuous flow of fresh, cold<br />\nair\u2014a welcome change, we note,<br />\nfrom the artiflcally-treated air<br />\none is forced to breathe in modern automobiles. The paint is, of<br />\ncourse, the finest lacquer, and<br />\nits unique patina would be hard<br />\nto duplicate in any but the most<br />\nexpensive auto finishes. The<br />\nhood ornament, a classic in<br />\nits own right, is the famous<br />\nFord \"Plastic Hunk\", so popular in the late forties and early<br />\nfifties\u2014up to the Civil War.<br />\nIts design represents the freedom<br />\nof speed and motion, and the<br />\nintegrity inherent in this proud<br />\nsteed of the highways.<br />\nNo discussion of the outer car<br />\nwould be complete without a<br />\nthorough examination of the fine<br />\nremovable top. Many radical design features have been incorporated in its production. In<br />\nanswer to an oft-heard corn-<br />\n<br />\nplaint that the top refuses to go<br />\ndown through motor malfunction, the possibility of such malfunction has been precluded by<br />\nthe elimination of the motor. In<br />\na sweeping change in top construction concept, Ford's top<br />\ngoes up and down by hand.<br />\nGreat on all but the rainiest<br />\ndays. An equally radical design<br />\nfeature is the use of dependable<br />\ngrey canvas to replace easilytearing vinyl. Kudos on these<br />\ntwo great accomplishments.<br />\nLet us now turn to the technical aspects of this rarest of<br />\nall great cars.

It<br />\nWill affect future American political history as much as have<br />\nthe gmat wars and depressions.<br />\nThe \"linage\" of the Republican<br />\nParty cannot be restored to \"the<br />\nParty of responsibility\" now by<br />\nMadison avenue techniques or<br />\neven by our able political medieine man, Ray Bliss.<br />\nThe Republican party needs<br />\nthe intellectual and collegiate<br />\nMind to express its thoughts. It<br />\nneeds the minds and plans of<br />\nthose who read this column. The<br />\nAmerican political system needs<br />\nthe eloquence of an Adlai<br />\nStevenson or the prosaic turn of<br />\nthe word of a John Kennedy<br />\nfroni the Republican side of the<br />\naisle. We, Young Republicans,<br />\nas authors of this column, intend to treat the daily issues<br />\nfrom a quasi-intellectual view<br />\nPoint.<br />\nThe Republican party Is a<br />\nPolitical party whose sole concern is with the governing of<br />\nthis country and its relations<br />\nWith other countries. The RePublican party is not an organization created to grind out dogma on theoretical issues. Its doctrines cannot and should not extend out of the practical and<br />\nMaterial. With this attitude, a<br />\nPolitical party will lose most of<br />\nits Intellectual support from the<br />\nbeginning. However, the ideals,<br />\nbeliefs, and convictions of the<br />\nindividual can be transformed<br />\ninto reality through political<br />\nParties. The Democratic Party,<br />\nalthough not completely successful at this, has kindled the enthusiasm of the intellectual<br />\ncommunity more than the RePublican party. Enough for political philosophy<br />\nDr. Mandelbaum, Professor in<br />\n\"Philosophic Classics and Problems\" (courses which I heartily<br />\n<br />\nrecommend) once remarked to<br />\nme that if one thoroughly learned moral and ethical philosophy,<br />\npolitical philosophy could be<br />\nfigured out on a slide-rule. All<br />\nthe more power to him.<br />\nLet's start with the issue of<br />\nhonesty in government. This issue could hardly save Barry<br />\nGoldwater's campaign from the<br />\nstigma of World War III, segregation, or poverty for everyone<br />\nover 65. But historically and<br />\ncertainly in practice today, the<br />\nRepublican party has been the<br />\ncleaner of the two parties. The<br />\nabsconding New York mayor,<br />\nJimmie Walker, was succeeded<br />\nby a LaGuardia. The Hague's,<br />\nthe Prentergast's, the Tweed's,<br />\nthe De Sapio's, and the Bobby<br />\nBaker's are in the tradition of<br />\nmachine politics and all happen<br />\nto be Democrats. The Republicans cannot be particularly<br />\nproud of the Ulysses Grant administration after the Civil War,<br />\nor the Sherman Adams vicuna<br />\ncoat incident. By and large, however, the openness of political<br />\nopinion and the unregimented,<br />\nindividualistic attitude of Republicans does not lead to absolute<br />\ncontrol of the party in any one<br />\nplace. Therefore, corruption under the eagle eye of the Democratic leaders is quite a difficult<br />\nthing for Republicans.<br />\nBut does this really matter?<br />\nRead the speeches of President<br />\nJohnson<br />\nand<br />\nother Democratic leaders.

The competition<br />\nof small firms gave way to the<br />\nconcentration of the basic decisions of production and distribution into a small number of<br />\ncorporations.<br />\nproBefore World War<br />\ngressives looked to government<br />\nas a force capable of ensuring<br />\nthe \"public responsibility\" of<br />\ncorporations. But even the progressive Wilson administration,<br />\nIn spite of its election pronouncements, quickly realized what<br />\nTheodore Roosevelt had learned<br />\n\u2014that the government, lacking<br />\nany real economic power of its<br />\nown, could only co-operate with,<br />\nand not coerce, the corporate<br />\nrulers of American economic life.<br />\nEven during the first deof<br />\nFranklin<br />\nyears<br />\npression<br />\nRoosevelt's administration, the<br />\n<br />\ngovernment could experiment<br />\nwith programs of social legislation only so far as they did not<br />\nthreaten corporation rule.<br />\nIn fact, Roosevelt's first legislation, the key to his first New<br />\nDeal recovery program\u2014the National Industrial Recovery Act\u2014<br />\nwas concerned with legalizing,<br />\nco-operating with, and helping<br />\nto extend the concentration of<br />\neconomic power into the hands<br />\nof progressively fewer corporations.<br />\nBut the 30's also gave birth to<br />\nthe first real challenge to the<br />\neconomic power of the giant<br />\ncorporations\u2014organized labor on<br />\nan industry wide basis.<br />\nIn making economic decisions,<br />\nsuch as wages and working conditions, corporations had to take<br />\ninto increasingly greater account<br />\nthe power of their organized<br />\nworkers, wielding the weapon of<br />\nstrike.<br />\nBut even these economic decisions in a highly centralized<br />\nand industrialized economy had<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and old, try:<br />\n<br />\nPecora's Resfauranf<br />\nfor the finest Italian food in<br />\n<br />\ntown<br />\n<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSP AGH ETTI MEALS<br />\n<br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br />\n<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nA button-down In a basket weave.<br />\n(Something old,something new.)<br />\n<br />\nTit<br />\n<br />\nThis Arrow shirt gives you best of<br />\nboth worlds.(1)A long-pointed<br />\ncollar role in the most authentic<br />\ntradition.(2) A husky-looking<br />\nbasket weave that updates<br />\nordinary oxford.

Higher wages secured<br />\nfrom an employer become meaningless for workers thrown out<br />\nof work because of technological<br />\nunemployment.<br />\nThe right to strike, the ultimate economic .power of organized labor, becomes meaningless<br />\nwhen the government, as under<br />\nthe Taft-Hartley Act, continually<br />\nintervenes to suppress strikes in<br />\nmajor industries.<br />\nConsequently, in order to preserve its power as a labor movement, labor is forced to act politically\u2014to preserve those gains<br />\nmade across the bargaining table<br />\nand to gain those benefits only a<br />\nhealthy economy can provide.<br />\nThe political mechanism traditionally utilized by labor since<br />\nthe 30's has been the Democratic<br />\nparty.<br />\nWithout discussing the historical evolution of this relationship<br />\nbetween the Democratic party<br />\nand the organized labor movement, we can only focus on the<br />\nmost recent developments in<br />\nterms of the Johnson administration.<br />\nOn every Great Society bill\u2014<br />\npoverty, education. medicare,<br />\nbeautification \u2014 labor worked<br />\nhard for President Johnson. In<br />\nreturn labor sought three 'goals\u2014<br />\nrepeal of Section 14b of the<br />\nTaft-Hartley Act (which now<br />\npermits states to outlaw compulsory unionism), higher minimum wage, and liberalization of<br />\nthe unemployment compensation<br />\nsystem. They got none.<br />\n<br />\nThe reaction of labor leaders<br />\nto this political orphanage was<br />\nsummed up by one labor lobbyist<br />\nat a meeting of leaders on October 11: \"President Johnson has<br />\npassed a lot of bills, but they're<br />\nall concensus bills \u2014 backed by<br />\nbusiness as well as labor. He's<br />\nnot pushing a single bill really<br />\ntough for big business to swallow.\" But even more important<br />\nthan this recognition of labor's<br />\npolitical impotence within the<br />\nDemocratic party is the leadership's rationalization and remedy for such impotence.<br />\nIn the first place, the strength<br />\nof organized labor has been significantly lessened since World<br />\nWar II. Union membership has<br />\noften declined in relation to the<br />\nwork force; organizing campaigns (particularly in the potentially powerful white collar<br />\nsector) have been weak. Related<br />\nto this quantitative decline has<br />\nbeen a decline of militancy.<br />\nUnion leaders cannot rally the<br />\npolitical militancy of the rankand-file against Johnson because<br />\nthese same leaders are almost<br />\ndaily involved in suppressing<br />\nshop militancy, selling company<br />\ncontracts to discontented workers, and generally playing the<br />\nrole of Johnson's ambassadors to<br />\nthe working class. And finally,<br />\nthe labor leadership is so tied to<br />\nthe Democratic party that the<br />\nultimate threat to Johnson\u2014a<br />\nparty bolt\u2014is out of the question.<br />\nAs the Washington correspondents, Evans and Novack, point<br />\nout, \"With all its grievances, big<br />\nlabor isn't about to say anything<br />\nout loud criticizing President<br />\nJohnson ... It has nowhere else<br />\nto go.\" More correctly, labor<br />\nleadership has nowhere else to<br />\ngo.<br />\nWhether or not the rank-andfile workers of the unions continue to tolerate this organizational stagnation, suppression of<br />\neconomic militancy, and political impotence, is another question.<br />\n<br />\nBy JIM MONGIARDO<br />\nWhat do you do when you<br />\nenter Hopkins if your father was<br />\nan All American lacrosse player<br />\nin the golden days of Bluejay lacrosse?

Soon afterward<br />\na half-dozen police cars jammed<br />\nCalvert Alley where Wilson stood<br />\nalone to greet them. Only<br />\nthrough the shrewdest powers of<br />\nnegotiation was Wilson able to<br />\nconvince the officers that they<br />\nwere not victims of a collegiate<br />\nprank.<br />\nThe suspect, who had reached<br />\nGreenmount<br />\nAvenue, sought<br />\nmomentary relief in the restroom of a neighborhood tavern.<br />\nSheridan, considering the temper<br />\nof the establishment, elected to<br />\nwait outside while police arrived<br />\nto apprehend the prowler.<br />\nThe Northern District Police<br />\nand the Ace Elastic bandage<br />\ncompany combined to bring the<br />\nsituation well under control. The<br />\nsuspect claimed that, he had entered the woman's parked car<br />\nlooking \"for a peaceful night's<br />\nrest.\"<br />\nOn Tuesday, October 19 in the<br />\nCounty Court, North Maryland<br />\nDistrict at 9:00 A.M., the suspect<br />\nwas found guilty of vagrancy<br />\nand is currently serving a sixtyday sentence in the city jail.<br /><br />\nquest was refused by Robert<br />\nMcCloskey, press officer for the<br />\nState Department, who explained that \"only under such conditions could Dean Rusk be more<br />\nhonest \u2014 or, as we say in the<br />\ncandid.\"<br />\nDepartment,<br />\nState<br />\nDawidowicz and Harding then<br />\nleft, since, according to Dawidowicz, \"We could not in good<br />\nconscience enter under the pretense of keeping quiet, and later<br />\npublicize the discussion.\"<br />\nAlthough it was finely agreed<br />\nupon to send representatives, a<br />\nnumber of SDS members expressed disapproval of the invitation<br />\nat a gathering Thersday of approximately half of the chapter.<br />\nIt was felt that attending the<br />\nclosed session with Rusk might<br />\nbe construed as tacit SDS approval of such seminars, which<br />\nthe organization has strongly<br />\ndenounced.

This<br />\nwas not a limited production car<br />\nby any means, so the scarcity of<br />\nthe model is accounted to hoarding by collectors and museums,<br />\nas well as scrap metal processing<br />\nconcerns.<br />\nThe first thing one notices<br />\nupon approaching the automobile, besides the smell of oil, is<br />\nthe striking design of the coachwork, and the obvious care with<br />\nwhich the automobile was con-<br /><br />\nstructed. On notices that in the<br />\nancient Ford tradition, the body<br />\nhas rotted out in a symmetrical,<br />\nartistically coherent pattern,<br />\ngiving the car great unity of design.

Many radical design features have been incorporated in its production. In<br />\nanswer to an oft-heard corn-<br /><br />\nplaint that the top refuses to go<br />\ndown through motor malfunction, the possibility of such malfunction has been precluded by<br />\nthe elimination of the motor.

We, Young Republicans,<br />\nas authors of this column, intend to treat the daily issues<br />\nfrom a quasi-intellectual view<br />\nPoint.<br />\nThe Republican party Is a<br />\nPolitical party whose sole concern is with the governing of<br />\nthis country and its relations<br />\nWith other countries. The RePublican party is not an organization created to grind out dogma on theoretical issues. Its doctrines cannot and should not extend out of the practical and<br />\nMaterial. With this attitude, a<br />\nPolitical party will lose most of<br />\nits Intellectual support from the<br />\nbeginning. However, the ideals,<br />\nbeliefs, and convictions of the<br />\nindividual can be transformed<br />\ninto reality through political<br />\nParties. The Democratic Party,<br />\nalthough not completely successful at this, has kindled the enthusiasm of the intellectual<br />\ncommunity more than the RePublican party. Enough for political philosophy<br />\nDr. Mandelbaum, Professor in<br />\n\"Philosophic Classics and Problems\" (courses which I heartily<br /><br />\nrecommend) once remarked to<br />\nme that if one thoroughly learned moral and ethical philosophy,<br />\npolitical philosophy could be<br />\nfigured out on a slide-rule. All<br />\nthe more power to him.<br />\nLet's start with the issue of<br />\nhonesty in government. This issue could hardly save Barry<br />\nGoldwater's campaign from the<br />\nstigma of World War III, segregation, or poverty for everyone<br />\nover 65. But historically and<br />\ncertainly in practice today, the<br />\nRepublican party has been the<br />\ncleaner of the two parties. The<br />\nabsconding New York mayor,<br />\nJimmie Walker, was succeeded<br />\nby a LaGuardia. The Hague's,<br />\nthe Prentergast's, the Tweed's,<br />\nthe De Sapio's, and the Bobby<br />\nBaker's are in the tradition of<br />\nmachine politics and all happen<br />\nto be Democrats. The Republicans cannot be particularly<br />\nproud of the Ulysses Grant administration after the Civil War,<br />\nor the Sherman Adams vicuna<br />\ncoat incident. By and large, however, the openness of political<br />\nopinion and the unregimented,<br />\nindividualistic attitude of Republicans does not lead to absolute<br />\ncontrol of the party in any one<br />\nplace. Therefore, corruption under the eagle eye of the Democratic leaders is quite a difficult<br />\nthing for Republicans.<br />\nBut does this really matter?<br />\nRead the speeches of President<br />\nJohnson<br />\nand<br />\nother Democratic leaders.

The competition<br />\nof small firms gave way to the<br />\nconcentration of the basic decisions of production and distribution into a small number of<br />\ncorporations.<br />\nproBefore World War<br />\ngressives looked to government<br />\nas a force capable of ensuring<br />\nthe \"public responsibility\" of<br />\ncorporations. But even the progressive Wilson administration,<br />\nIn spite of its election pronouncements, quickly realized what<br />\nTheodore Roosevelt had learned<br />\n\u2014that the government, lacking<br />\nany real economic power of its<br />\nown, could only co-operate with,<br />\nand not coerce, the corporate<br />\nrulers of American economic life.<br />\nEven during the first deof<br />\nFranklin<br />\nyears<br />\npression<br />\nRoosevelt's administration, the<br /><br />\ngovernment could experiment<br />\nwith programs of social legislation only so far as they did not<br />\nthreaten corporation rule.<br />\nIn fact, Roosevelt's first legislation, the key to his first New<br />\nDeal recovery program\u2014the National Industrial Recovery Act\u2014<br />\nwas concerned with legalizing,<br />\nco-operating with, and helping<br />\nto extend the concentration of<br />\neconomic power into the hands<br />\nof progressively fewer corporations.<br />\nBut the 30's also gave birth to<br />\nthe first real challenge to the<br />\neconomic power of the giant<br />\ncorporations\u2014organized labor on<br />\nan industry wide basis.<br />\nIn making economic decisions,<br />\nsuch as wages and working conditions, corporations had to take<br />\ninto increasingly greater account<br />\nthe power of their organized<br />\nworkers, wielding the weapon of<br />\nstrike.<br />\nBut even these economic decisions in a highly centralized<br />\nand industrialized economy had<br /><br />\nHopkins students, new and old, try:<br /><br />\nPecora's Resfauranf<br />\nfor the finest Italian food in<br /><br />\ntown<br /><br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSP AGH ETTI MEALS<br /><br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br /><br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br /><br />\nA button-down In a basket weave.<br />\n(Something old,something new.)<br /><br />\nTit<br /><br />\nThis Arrow shirt gives you best of<br />\nboth worlds.(1)A long-pointed<br />\ncollar role in the most authentic<br />\ntradition.(2) A husky-looking<br />\nbasket weave that updates<br />\nordinary oxford.

They got none.<br /><br />\nThe reaction of labor leaders<br />\nto this political orphanage was<br />\nsummed up by one labor lobbyist<br />\nat a meeting of leaders on October 11: \"President Johnson has<br />\npassed a lot of bills, but they're<br />\nall concensus bills \u2014 backed by<br />\nbusiness as well as labor. He's<br />\nnot pushing a single bill really<br />\ntough for big business to swallow.\" But even more important<br />\nthan this recognition of labor's<br />\npolitical impotence within the<br />\nDemocratic party is the leadership's rationalization and remedy for such impotence.<br />\nIn the first place, the strength<br />\nof organized labor has been significantly lessened since World<br />\nWar II. Union membership has<br />\noften declined in relation to the<br />\nwork force; organizing campaigns (particularly in the potentially powerful white collar<br />\nsector) have been weak. Related<br />\nto this quantitative decline has<br />\nbeen a decline of militancy.<br />\nUnion leaders cannot rally the<br />\npolitical militancy of the rankand-file against Johnson because<br />\nthese same leaders are almost<br />\ndaily involved in suppressing<br />\nshop militancy, selling company<br />\ncontracts to discontented workers, and generally playing the<br />\nrole of Johnson's ambassadors to<br />\nthe working class. And finally,<br />\nthe labor leadership is so tied to<br />\nthe Democratic party that the<br />\nultimate threat to Johnson\u2014a<br />\nparty bolt\u2014is out of the question.<br />\nAs the Washington correspondents, Evans and Novack, point<br />\nout, \"With all its grievances, big<br />\nlabor isn't about to say anything<br />\nout loud criticizing President<br />\nJohnson ... It has nowhere else<br />\nto go.\" More correctly, labor<br />\nleadership has nowhere else to<br />\ngo.<br />\nWhether or not the rank-andfile workers of the unions continue to tolerate this organizational stagnation, suppression of<br />\neconomic militancy, and political impotence, is another question.<br /><br />\nBy JIM MONGIARDO<br />\nWhat do you do when you<br />\nenter Hopkins if your father was<br />\nan All American lacrosse player<br />\nin the golden days of Bluejay lacrosse?
