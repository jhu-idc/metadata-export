The temporary blacklisting of the majority of the sophomore class is being used by them<br />\nas an argument against such a Contest, in that they claim to be unprepared through lack of freedom<br />\nto practice; but the general concensus of opinion in the University<br />\nseems to be that it is \"up to\" the<br />\nsophomores to go in and play the<br />\ngame.

JOHN'S<br />\nAnnapolis Team, Unable to Withstand Taliaferro's Fierce Charges<br />\nThrough Its Line, Goes Down to Defeat, 14 to 3-Tippett<br />\nand Bowers Star-Wilkinson Elected Captain.<br />\nTaliaferro opened the game by kicking off to Clark, who advanced the<br />\nball to the 30-yard line. St. John's tried an end run, but failed. On the<br />\nsecond play, however, Clark made a spurt around right end for 35 yards,<br />\nbut St. John's were penalized 15 yards for holding. Then McNutt punted<br />\nfor 40 yards to Tippett, who was downed in midfield. Taliaferro made<br />\nfour yards through the line. Brooks made two more, and on the next<br />\nplay gained one. Then Hopkins was penalized five yards for being offside. On the next play Taliaferro went through the line eight yards<br />\nfor first down. In two more line plays, Branham and Taliaferro netted<br />\nsix yards. On the next play Taliaferro gained the four necessary to<br />\nmake first down.

Taliaferro made first down on'a line plunge.<br />\nBrooks tore through tackle for m yards, placing the ball on the St. John's<br />\none-yard line.

Score, 7 to 0.<br />\nTaliaferro kicked off to Heise, who advanced from the m-yard mark<br />\nuntil he was spilled by Bowers on the 34-yard line. St. John's gained<br />\none yard through the line, and then failed ill a poor attempt at a forward pass. Hanver tried an end run, but was brought to earth by Wilkinson after a gain of four yards. St. John's was then forced to punt.<br />\nTippett received, and went five yards. Hopkins then resumed a series<br />\nof line plays, Brooks and Taliaferro tearing through for first down in<br />\nthree plays. Tippett broke away around the end for 12 yards, but Hopkins lost 15 yards for holding. After two line plays, which netted six<br />\nyards for Hopkins, Tippett tried a drop-kick from the 40-yard line, hut<br />\nfailed. St. John's then worked a fake pass for 15 yards. Hopkins held<br />\nfor one play, but on the next St. John's pulled off an end run for 20<br />\nyards. Taliaferro was taken out on account of a hurt ankle. Chunn<br />\nreplaced him.<br />\nOn a fumble, St. John's lost 12 yards. An end run gained nothing<br />\nfor them. On the third down Clark made Jo yards. McNutt then<br />\npunted to Tippett.

After Brooks<br />\nhad gained 12 yards by plunging-, Hopkins suffered a penalty of 15<br />\nyards for holding, and 'Selby blocked Tippett's kick just as the quarter<br />\nended.<br />\nSt. John's had the ball on Hopkins six-yard line.

Chunn went through for five yards. Wilkinson lost a little, but Brooks quickly forged ahead on the next play. Chunn<br />\nthen carried the ball to the 30-yard line. The Soldiers held for downs<br />\nand punted to Tippett who brought the ball back 10 yards. St. John's<br />\nseemed to hold for two plays, but Bowers tore off eight yards, and<br />\nBrooks three, before they could brace up again. They then held for<br />\nthree plays, and the ball went over. McNutt punted, Tippett fumbled,<br />\nand St. John's recovered the ball on their 35-yard line. They fumbled<br />\nin return, and Tippett failed again to drop-kick successfully. Clark took<br />\nthe pigskin 30 yards on an end run. St. John's tried line plunges, but<br />\nwas able to gain very little. The half ended with St. John's making<br />\nan incomplete pass.<br />\nAt the beginning of the third quarter Heise got away with the ball<br />\non the kickoff, taking it 20 yards before Bowers stopped him. St. John's<br />\nfailed on a fake pass, and was penalized five yards for being offside.<br />\nAn end run resulted in a loss, and they punted to Hopkins 15-yard line.<br />\nOn a double pass play, the Indians; favorite, Bowers made a sensational run to the St. John's 14-yard mark.

FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nROOTERS DID BRILLIANT WORK<br />\nSutton's Cheering Section in East Stand<br />\nHelped the 'Varsity Win Its Fight.<br />\nOh, You Six-Piece Band!<br />\n<br />\nOne of the most attractive features of the game was the splendid<br />\nrooting of Hopkins and St. John's<br />\nadmirers. The sections of the stand<br />\nthat had be_n assigned to those who<br />\ncheered the teams were filled to<br />\ncapacity.<br />\nAccompanied by a band of six loud<br />\npieces, the Hopkins cohorts sang<br />\nand shouted themselves hoarse, undeterred by the bad weather.<br />\nBeginning about a half an hour<br />\nbefore the game was called, the<br />\nrooting was almost continuous for<br />\ntwo hours, the only lull coming between the two halves. Wh:n the<br />\nteams were in midfield the strains<br />\nof 'We've Got Sand in Our Makeup\" and \"Where, Oh \\\\There, Are<br />\nthe Soldier Boys?\" floated out encouraging-iv over the field; when<br />\nHopkins was near the goal, there<br />\nwere heard the urgent entreaties:<br />\n\"We Want a Touchdown\" and \"Hit<br />\n'Ern Again, Hard !\" And even<br />\nwhen St. John's had Hopkins on<br />\nthe Black and Blue's two-yard line,<br />\nthe 'Varsity rooters cheered to such<br />\ngood effect that their goal-line was<br />\nnot crossed. When a man was<br />\nhurt or brought distinction upon<br />\nhimself by a spectacular run or<br />\ntackle, he was given a long ra-a-y<br />\nor a hearty hullabaloo. In fact<br />\nthose \"on the side of the line\" distinguished themselves almost as<br />\nmuch as the heroes on the field.<br />\nWhen the whistle blew the game<br />\nto a close and it was known that<br />\nHopkins had wiped out completely<br />\nlast year's defeat, there was a display of spirit and enthusiasm such<br />\nas had never before been seen on<br />\nthe Homewood grounds. Rushing<br />\non to the field, about wo or 150<br />\nHopkins students formed in single<br />\nfile, and pulled off a weird snake<br />\ndance to the two goals. They<br />\nthrew into the air their hats and<br />\nmegaphones and broke out into wild<br />\ncheering. The crowd then rushed<br />\nto the clubhouse, where it stood<br />\noutsid2 of the dressing-rooms,<br />\ncheering the St. John's team and<br />\nthe individual members of the Hopkins squad. Cates, Hunter and<br />\nDorsey were given noisy yells of<br />\napproval, and the party broke up<br />\njust as night was beginning to settle<br />\nover Homewood field.<br />\nOne prominent characteristic of<br />\nthe rooting was the good feeling<br />\nshown by the two student bodies.<br />\nBefore the game they exchanged<br />\ncheers of greeting, and after it a<br />\nhearty one of Hopkins gave St.<br />\nJohn's consolation. St. John's sang<br />\n\"Aul Lang Syne.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 1, 1913.<br />\n<br />\nJOEL GUTMAN & CO.<br />\n112 to 122 N.

It was a<br />\nvery effective one, however, for before the end of the first half Patton carried the ball over Hopkins<br />\nline for a touchdown, and Baker<br />\nkicked goal.<br />\nThe line bucking of W.

It<br />\nwas Hopkins game from the kickoff, and the College team were<br />\nrouted at every point, only scoring<br />\nonce, and that on a fluke.<br />\nFrancis was the hero of the day<br />\nand his beautiful run of sixty yards<br />\nfor a touchdown was the feature of<br />\nthe game. Hodges played a wonderful game, and the work of Robinson, Haulenbeek and Talty also deserves much credit.<br />\nHopkins,0; Swarthmore, 16.<br />\n<br />\nAll the scoring in this game was<br />\ndone in the first half.

FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nROOTERS DID BRILLIANT WORK<br />\nSutton's Cheering Section in East Stand<br />\nHelped the 'Varsity Win Its Fight.<br />\nOh, You Six-Piece Band!<br /><br />\nOne of the most attractive features of the game was the splendid<br />\nrooting of Hopkins and St. John's<br />\nadmirers. The sections of the stand<br />\nthat had be_n assigned to those who<br />\ncheered the teams were filled to<br />\ncapacity.<br />\nAccompanied by a band of six loud<br />\npieces, the Hopkins cohorts sang<br />\nand shouted themselves hoarse, undeterred by the bad weather.<br />\nBeginning about a half an hour<br />\nbefore the game was called, the<br />\nrooting was almost continuous for<br />\ntwo hours, the only lull coming between the two halves. Wh:n the<br />\nteams were in midfield the strains<br />\nof 'We've Got Sand in Our Makeup\" and \"Where, Oh \\\\There, Are<br />\nthe Soldier Boys?\" floated out encouraging-iv over the field; when<br />\nHopkins was near the goal, there<br />\nwere heard the urgent entreaties:<br />\n\"We Want a Touchdown\" and \"Hit<br />\n'Ern Again, Hard !\" And even<br />\nwhen St. John's had Hopkins on<br />\nthe Black and Blue's two-yard line,<br />\nthe 'Varsity rooters cheered to such<br />\ngood effect that their goal-line was<br />\nnot crossed. When a man was<br />\nhurt or brought distinction upon<br />\nhimself by a spectacular run or<br />\ntackle, he was given a long ra-a-y<br />\nor a hearty hullabaloo. In fact<br />\nthose \"on the side of the line\" distinguished themselves almost as<br />\nmuch as the heroes on the field.<br />\nWhen the whistle blew the game<br />\nto a close and it was known that<br />\nHopkins had wiped out completely<br />\nlast year's defeat, there was a display of spirit and enthusiasm such<br />\nas had never before been seen on<br />\nthe Homewood grounds. Rushing<br />\non to the field, about wo or 150<br />\nHopkins students formed in single<br />\nfile, and pulled off a weird snake<br />\ndance to the two goals. They<br />\nthrew into the air their hats and<br />\nmegaphones and broke out into wild<br />\ncheering. The crowd then rushed<br />\nto the clubhouse, where it stood<br />\noutsid2 of the dressing-rooms,<br />\ncheering the St. John's team and<br />\nthe individual members of the Hopkins squad. Cates, Hunter and<br />\nDorsey were given noisy yells of<br />\napproval, and the party broke up<br />\njust as night was beginning to settle<br />\nover Homewood field.<br />\nOne prominent characteristic of<br />\nthe rooting was the good feeling<br />\nshown by the two student bodies.<br />\nBefore the game they exchanged<br />\ncheers of greeting, and after it a<br />\nhearty one of Hopkins gave St.<br />\nJohn's consolation.

But it<br />\nis enough that Hopkins beat St.<br />\nJohn's.<br />\nTHE NEN,vs-LETTP,R takes the responsibility of giving to the team<br />\nof 1913, as from Hopkins undergraduates, a vote of deep gratitude<br />\nfor what it has accomplished. To<br />\nCoall Jack Cates we give our<br />\nthanks for half a season's excellent<br />\nservice. We hope that he will<br />\nhandle the squad again next season.<br />\nTo Manager John L. Dorsey is also<br />\ndue thanks for his untiring efforts<br />\nto successfully carry on the business affairs of the team. To Captain Ray Leibensperger, tackle, we<br />\nextend congratulations, and to his<br />\nmate on the other side of the line,<br />\nCaptain-elect Paul Wilkinson, we<br />\nwish a most successful season in<br /><br />\nSMART<br /><br />\nCLOTHES<br />\nFOR<br /><br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY 10 PUT ON AND MADE 10 MEASURE<br />\n=<br />\nE.<br />\nI<br />\ns<br /><br />\nPLAZA BLDG.<br /><br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nThe Track Team.<br /><br />\nBy ry man while at the University should try his ability in some<br />\nform of athletics. A man's college<br />\ntraining is not complete without it.<br />\nEspecially in a college situated as<br />\nHopkins is, without dormitories, a<br />\nman r ally gets a grzat deal more<br />\nout of college lif2 than if he had<br />\nnot played on an athletic team. It<br />\ndoes not take time from his studies<br />\nnor lower his marks; it makes a<br />\nman more efficient for work.<br />\nLittle Dr. Queed, in Harrison's<br />\nrec nt novel, makes the discovery<br />\nthat the hour lost in exercise each<br />\nday does not take away from his<br />\ndaily output of work\u2014he can think<br />\nmore cl:arly and work better for<br />\nhaving made his body physically<br />\nfit. So don't think that because<br />\nyou come out for a team you are<br />\ngoing to flunk your physics.<br />\nAt Hopkins there has been built<br />\nup in the last few years a track<br />\nteam that is a credit to the University. Some can remember that<br />\nfour years ago, when the time came<br />\nto choose a relay team, there were<br />\nso few mcn available that it was<br />\na foregone conclusion who would<br />\nmake the team. Last year there<br />\nwere enough men for three relays<br />\nand it was not known until the last<br />\nmoment who would compose the big<br />\nfour, so keen was the competition.<br />\nRecent development has been due<br />\nin part to our fine Homewood track,<br />\nwithout doubt one of the finest<br />\ntracks in the country; in part to<br />\nthe great work of the coaches who<br />\nhave been with the men all the<br />\ntime, tirelessly working to make a<br />\nwinning team; above all it has been<br />\ndue to the great spirit among the<br />\nmen. Mr. England has instilled a<br />\nmanly fighting spirit, yet with it a<br />\nspirit of fair sportsmanship, into<br />\nall the men, and the team is not a<br />\ngroup of self-interested individuals,<br />\nbut an entity made up of all the<br />\nmen of the squad.<br />\nThe track team organization<br />\nmeeting will be held on Tuesday<br />\nafternoon, December 2, at five<br />\no'clock in the Trophy Room. Every<br />\nman in the University is invited<br />\nto be there to hear what the track<br />\nteam purposes to do this, coming<br />\nseason.
