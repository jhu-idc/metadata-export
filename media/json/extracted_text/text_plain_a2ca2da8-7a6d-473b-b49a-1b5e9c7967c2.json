Now, there are seven<br />\nmembers of the judicial board and<br />\nnone ofthem are presidents of the<br />\nfraternities. We're doing it on a<br />\nrotating basis. So that one year<br />\nyou may not be on it, but the next<br />\nyear, your group will be<br />\nrepresented. It's a smaller, more<br />\nmanageable board, selected from<br />\nthe fraternities. Then, the entire<br />\nIFC has voted on a judicial board<br />\nchairperson. That's one of the<br />\nmajor things. The proceedings<br />\nitself, I think, offer more due process than what we had in the past.<br />\nFor instance, if I was informed<br />\nof an incident that occurred, I<br />\nwould state what information I<br />\nhad, and then, the group might<br />\nhave some rebuttal to that. At that<br />\npoint, my advising role is really<br />\nover; I would leave. I think it will<br />\nbe more effective, as well,<br />\nbecause the presidents have so<br />\nmany other things going on. Plus,<br />\nto be honest, there are more<br />\npolitical things that happen, I<br />\nthink, when you have that kind of<br />\ngroup.

Mind<br />\nyou, there was no rational reason<br />\nthat she couldn't sleep. She<br />\nhadn't taken any nasal<br />\ndecongestants that reregulated<br />\nyour schedule so that even though<br />\nyou felt better you still missed<br />\nclass. She hadn't suddenly been<br />\nstruck by the realization that<br />\nRosebud was the sled (she had<br />\npicked up on that, thank you).<br />\nShe didn't even have Zack's<br />\neleventh-hour exam dread; she<br />\nknew she was all right\u2014she<br />\ndidn't have to stay up about it.<br />\nIn truth, Miranda had a malady<br />\nthat afflicted many a cresscountry enrollee; she was stuck<br />\nwith a case of pre-jet lag. Pre-jet<br />\nlag is what Miranda termed her<br />\nsubconscious readjustment of<br />\nschedule in the week before she<br />\nwent home. The pent-up longing<br />\nfor family, friends, and well,<br />\nDavid exhibited themselves in her<br />\nstaying up later each night as her<br />\ndeparture date got closer. Usually, when she got home, she was<br />\nalready on California time.<br />\nUnfortunately, that did her no<br />\ngood at 4:01 on the east coast.<br />\nShe looked again. 4:02.<br />\nThat line of thought took<br />\naltogether too short a time, she<br />\nmused. There had to be<br />\nsomething to get her to sleep.<br />\nWithout shrinking her mucus<br />\nmembranes, that is.<br />\nShe heard a shuffling from the<br />\nhall. Still 4:02. She figured that<br />\nshe might as well go see who else<br />\nwas up because that time sure<br />\nwasn't going to change if she sat<br />\nthere and waited for it.<br />\nNo big surprise; it was Zack.<br />\n\"Hi, Miranda,\" he groaned.<br />\nBy the last week of school, Zack<br />\nwould have said \"I just got a date<br />\nwith Winona Ryder\" with a<br />\ngroan. Zack was facing the<br />\nrevenge of the semester, an inevitable outshoot of his scholarly policy: \"If you ignore it, it'll<br />\ngo away.\"<br />\n\"How's History of Death com-<br />\n<br />\n'If I go to page four,'<br />\nZack said with panic,<br />\n'Russia is Communist<br />\nand France is taken<br />\nover by Yugoslavia!'<br />\ning?\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"I'm on page three,\" Zack<br />\ngroaned. \u2014The exam is tomorrow<br />\nand I haven't gone to class and<br />\nI skipped all my sections and I<br />\nhave to learn it all tonight and I'm<br />\non page three and it's four in the<br />\nmorning.\"<br />\n\"Four oh-two,\" Miranda<br />\ncorrected.<br />\n\"Oh God,\" Zack groaned. \"I<br />\nshould be on chapter seven by<br />\nnow!\"<br />\n\"What chapter are you on?\"<br />\nMiranda asked.<br />\nBy now Zack's moaning has<br />\ngiven way to manic terror. \"I'm<br />\non page three! I told you I was<br />\non page three! I'm on page three<br />\nand my exam is tomorrow at nine<br />\nand it's four in the morning and<br />\nI can't for the life of me<br />\nremember what was on page one<br />\nand two! Aaaaargh!\"<br />\nMiranda half-mindedly took<br />\nDoris' cup out of the microwave<br />\nand started to fill her own mug<br />\nwith water.<br />\n\"Maybe you should skip page<br />\nthree. Move on to something later<br />\nin the chapter. Like page four.\"<br />\n\"Sure!\" Zack screamed silently enough not to wake up Doris<br />\nor Carol. \"I go on to page four<br />\nbut then I don't know what went<br />\non on page three and Russia is<br />\nCommunist and France is taken<br />\nover by Yugoslavia an I don't<br />\neven know what happened to<br />\nCopernicus! What happened to<br />\nCopernicus, Miranda? What happened to him?\"<br />\nMiranda looked pityingly into<br />\nZack's exam-crazed eyes. \"He<br />\ndidn't make it, Zack. I'm sorry.\"<br />\nContinued on page 8<br />\n<br />\nAnother Department Suffers From Neglect<br />\nJohns Hopkins University may soon have one less academic field<br />\nin the School of Arts and Sciences in need of attention and oh-soprecious funds. Recently, the Department of Psychology experienced a series of blows that will prove fatal to social psychology at<br />\nHopkins and extremely debilitating to the Department of Psychology<br />\nfor at least several years. At its November 21 meeting, the Academic<br />\nCouncil did not approve a crucial appointment to the Psychology faculty. The appointment would have brought to Hopkins a prominent<br />\nsocial psychologist\u2014an asset desperately needed and long overdue.<br />\nIt is impossible to untangle the complicated factors that led to the<br />\nCouncil's decision to deny the appointment of William Crano, particulary as specifics are confidential. Clearly, however, there is a<br />\ndiscrepancy between the Department of Psychology's perception of<br />\nhis credentials and the Academic Council's. And in light of the<br />\nevidence that is available concerning Crano, the Council's decision<br />\nis controversial at best. Crano is popular among the students currently in his class and had the unreserved support of several faculty<br />\nmembers. In his work he has not always followed traditional academic<br />\ntrajectories\u2014did he simply fall outside of Hopkins' rigid definition<br />\nof what an academician should be?<br />\nThe Academic Council must occasionally act against the recommendations of a department in order to fulfill its responsibilities. But<br />\nin this case much more lay in the balance than a class for next semester<br />\n(entitled Attitudes and Social Change, to have been taught by Crano,<br />\nand for which many students were already pre-registered) and a senior<br />\nfaculty position which will presumably be filled next year. The field<br />\nof social psychology at Hopkins had already experienced several setbacks and was held together only tenuously. This most recent Council<br />\ndecision merely removed the last bolt standing in the way of swift<br />\ncollapse.<br />\nAt a meeting last spring, the Council denied tenure to Steven<br />\nBreckler. While Breckler will be recommended to the Council by<br />\nhis department again this winter, he may not wait around for the<br />\nresults. Neither will Paula Niedenthal. She and Breckler are currently<br />\nthe only social psychologists that are full-time faculty members.<br />\nWithin the last year the Department of Psychology said goodbye to<br />\nits other social psychologists: Professor Milton Strauss left Hopkins<br />\nfor another university, and Professor Clinton DeSoto retired.<br />\nUnder normal circumstances it would be unreasonable to expect<br />\nNiedenthal and Breckler to bear the burden of maintaining a respec-<br />\n<br />\ntable social psychology field for the University. In light of recent<br />\nslaps in the face by the Academic Council, it is ridiculous. Both<br />\nlegitimately question Hopkins' commitment to social psychology and<br />\nare looking for positions elsewhere. What sane faculty member would<br />\nstay at a university where he or she had no colleagues in his or her<br />\nfield (and little hope of any arriving soon) and where one sensed at<br />\nthe very least profound neglect toward one's field'?<br />\nAcademic Council member Ronald Walters attempted to explain<br />\nthe actions of the Council: \"The Council thinks that the social<br />\npsychology area is important, so we are basically telling the Department of Psychology to aim higher.\" His words are ironic\u2014the action that was to send the message \"aim higher\" crippled the field<br />\nhere at Hopkins to such an extent that the department will now be<br />\nlucky to \"hit\" any mark at all, much less a \"higher\" one. The greater<br />\nsocial psychology professional community is not likely to take the<br />\nword of the Johns Hopkins Academic Council over other more<br />\nprestigious and influential programs. Loyalty among colleagues will<br />\nmake it difficult for Hopkins to attract any social psychologist.<br />\nPolitics, budgets, and credentials aside, Hopkins students will immediately experience the affects this series of events. Social<br />\nPsychology classes are extremely popular. They draw capacity crowds<br />\neach semester and meet specific needs of not only psychology majors but of a large portion of the general student population as well.<br />\nStudents majoring in psychology need classes in social psychology<br />\nin order to have a credible academic record when applying to graduate<br />\nschools. And many non-majors take them because much of the<br />\nmaterial is accessible and relevant not just to many other disciplines<br />\nbut to non-academic matters also. It is unacceptable for students to<br />\nhave as their only resources in social psychology part-time, offcampus, evening faculty members teaching one-time-only courses.<br />\nBut the Department of Psychology will have to resort to such measures<br />\nin order to offer the bare minimum courses necessary.<br />\nIs it neglect or calculation? It is difficult to imagine a university<br />\nadministration purposely disabling an area as important as social<br />\npsychology. Though the advertised budget crisis may indeed have<br />\nbeen a factor, cutting off a(nother) limb will not solve the problem.<br />\nStudents suffer now, but ultimately the University as an institution<br />\nwill pay the price for its repeated instances of profound neglect in<br />\nfundamental academic fields.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nA Little History of Hopkins ROTC\u2014and Ideas for<br />\nThe Future; News-Letter Misses the Mark on Lecture<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nControversies regarding ROTC on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus might slacken<br />\nif ROTC were made an optional, extracurricular activity unsubsidized<br />\nby The Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe Academic Council on<br />\nNovember 24, 1967, decided that<br />\ncredits earned in Military Science<br />\nwere not to be counted toward fulfillment of the requirements for the BA<br />\nand BES degrees. That Academic<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\nCouncil decision was reinforced 11<br />\nyears later when a student poll showed that 51 percent of undergraduate<br />\nstudents believed that ROTC should<br />\nbe strictly extracurricular, 36 percent favored elimination from campus entirely, and 13 percent believed that the program should be<br />\ngiven academic status (Morning<br />\nSun, May 16, 1969). Finally, at its<br />\nmeeting of May 20, 1970, the<br />\nAcademic Council by unanimous<br />\nvote requested the Administration to<br />\n\"remove from ROTC the remaining<br />\ncontractural or other vestiges of<br />\nacademic status.\" The Army<br />\nbalked; the Administration quietly<br />\ncaved in to preserve its ROTC<br />\nscholarship dollars. In March, 1975<br />\nNonon<br />\nCommittee<br />\nthe<br />\nDepartmental Courses limited<br />\nROTC credits on the transcript to<br />\nfour per ROTC student, down from<br />\neight. This situation prevailed until<br />\nthe school year 1989-1990 when<br />\nROTC reinstituted an eight-credit,<br />\ntwo-year program. Certainly, all<br />\nthese credits from a pseudoacademic<br />\nappendage should be eliminated as<br />\nwell as the listings on Hopkins<br />\nacademic transcripts.<br />\nPhilip E. Hartman<br />\nWilliam D. Gill,<br />\nProfessor in Biology<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n1 would like to share my perspective on the debate about the compatibility of ROTC's exclusionary<br />\npolicy toward homosexuals and<br />\nHopkins' anti-discrimination clause.<br />\nWhen I was applying to graduate<br />\nprograms, I limited my applications<br />\nto schools which explicitly stated that<br />\nthey do not discriminate on the basis<br />\nof sexual orientation. I did not want<br />\nthis to become an issue which would<br />\ndistract me from my academic work.<br />\nI entered into a professional relationship with Johns Hopkins University, trusting that its administrators<br />\nwould keep their word.<br />\nSince beginning my studies at<br />\nHopkins, I am no longer confident<br />\nthat the administrators of this<br />\nUniversity are trustworthy. If<br />\nHopkins houses and sponsors classes<br />\nand a scholarship program which are<br />\nopen only to heterosexuals, then our<br />\nadministrators cannot claim that we<br />\ndo not discriminate\". . .on the basis<br />\nof. . . homosexuality. . .\"<br />\nThis hesitance of the University<br />\nadministration to stand by their own<br />\npolicies makes me nervous. What<br />\nother groups will be officially ex-<br />\n<br />\neluded from University programs?<br />\nWhat other programs will choose to<br />\nexclude students, faculty or staff on<br />\nthe basis of minority status? What<br />\nother policies will the University administration ignore in favor of a program that brings in money? I am no<br />\nlonger confident that I can believe<br />\n<br />\nthe responses of University administrators to these questions.<br />\nM. Frank Stluka<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Tuesday, December 4, I went<br />\nto the weekly meeting of the Student<br />\nCouncil (7:00 p.m., Shriver Board<br />\nRoom), which is open to all students.<br />\nAmongst ot:ier things discussed at<br />\nthis meeting was the issue of ROTC<br />\non campus. Since I am a student,<br />\nwho is neither homosexual nor in<br />\nROTC, yet knows people in both<br />\ngroups, I would like to make two<br />\nobservations.<br />\nFirst, if you read the University's<br />\npolicy on non-discrimination, it<br />\nspecifically states non-discrimination<br />\nagainst homosexuals. ROTC is an<br />\non-campus program which does not<br />\nallow homosexuals full participation.<br />\nThis conflict with University nondiscrimination policy could be ended either by phasing out on-campus<br />\nROTC or by removing the University's policy of not discriminating<br />\nagainst homosexuals. In my opinion,<br />\nthose in favor of keeping ROTC as<br />\nan on-campus program should simply state: \"Yes, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity discriminates against<br />\nhomosexuals, but so does the<br />\ngovernment. Anyway, they're different from us and don't deserve the<br />\nsame access to the programs.\"<br />\nSecond, I'd like to remind<br />\neveryone that discrimination was a<br />\nbig topic during last year's student<br />\ncouncil elections. In fact in the<br />\nMarch 2, 1990 issue of the NewsLetter, a statement by Bob Nelson<br />\nread: \"Well, I'm concerned about<br />\nthe 'bigger picture' at Hopkins and<br />\nit's `-isms': racism, sexism, and<br />\nhomophobia. I think it's time that we<br />\nmade an effort to produce a more<br />\ntolerant campus....I don't think<br />\nthere's a big problem, but I'd like to<br />\nsee a lot more discussion, because<br />\n<br />\nSaudi Arabia, the destabilization that<br />\nwould proceed a regional war, may<br />\nrequire a continued occupation and<br />\nmilitary presence in Saudi Arabia by<br />\nthe United States. His intent was to<br />\nbring to the attention of the United<br />\nStates the different possible ramifications of our actions. Additionally,<br />\nVan Home places an inaccurate emphasis on the Gulf Crisis. The lecture focused on the economic viability of a Palestinian state, and the explanations about the Gulf were a personal preface given as an aside.<br />\nVan Home states, \"Bainerman<br />\nadded, 'I would advocate [that<br />\nIsrael] leave Gaza tomorrow,<br />\nwithout preconditions. If the Palestinians want to create an unstable<br />\nsituation and kill each other, that is<br />\nperfectly fine with me and the majority of Israelis.' He said, 'EvenMichael J. Byrne tually, then Israel would have to go<br />\nback in and maintain order.\" These<br />\nsentences provide a clear illustration<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe would like to apologize to of irresponsible use of quotes.

While Mr. Bainerman's views the West Bank would lead to an<br />\ndo not necessarily represent those of intra-Palestinian power struggle. To<br />\nthe Hopkins Jewish League, we ob- quote Bainerman, \"The first few<br />\nject to the lack of authenticity of the Katysha rockets will fly over the<br />\nborder, and eventually.. .\"UnforNews-Letter coverage.<br />\nJournalistic reporting requires ac- tunately, there are other similar<br />\ncuracy.

This misrepresentation of the understanding<br />\nspeaker's views was not only arguments.<br />\nA case in point of poor journalism<br />\nslanted, but manipulative. Additionally, a few of the quotes in the is the misnaming of the Jerusalem<br />\narticle were not actually Mr. Bainer- Post as the Jewish Post and that of<br />\nman's words. For example, there is the Palestine Liberation Organizaa tremendous difference between tion as the 'Palestinian Liberation<br />\nVan Home's,\"There will be a con- Organization.'

Mr. Bainerman ex- paragraph similarly omits important<br />\nplained that as a result of the United political context. The closure,<br />\nStates' military presence now in \"We're not equal,\" does not refer<br />\nto personal equality as Van Home<br />\nimplies. Bainerman was referring to<br />\ndiplomatic power. He explained that<br />\nonly stable political entities can give<br />\nassurances necessary for diplomatic<br />\nproperty of the News-Letter.<br />\nrelations on equal standing.<br />\nMore importantly, Van Home's<br />\nLetters must be no more than<br />\nselective use of quotes failed to men350 words and signed by at<br />\ntion one of Bainerman's key points.<br />\nleast one person and no more<br />\nBainerman emphasized repeatedly<br />\nthan two persons.

Never in my<br />\ncareer at Hopkins have I encountered so many students who<br />\ndisplayed such anger with a<br />\ncourse and, more notably, with<br />\na professor.<br />\nBy the end of the semester, we<br />\ncouldn't wait to get our hands on<br />\nCourse Guide evaluation forms.<br />\nWe wanted to make sure that no<br />\none would make the same mistake<br />\nagain. We at least came into the<br />\ncourse unaware of what was to<br />\ncome, as no review of the class<br />\nhad existed for our benefit in last<br />\nyear's Course Guide.<br />\nAnd sure enough, on the last<br />\nday of class, we received our<br />\nevaluation forms. I certainly<br />\nraked the professor, Enrica<br />\nDetragiache, over the coals. So<br />\ndid the person next to me, as did<br />\nthe person next to him. In fact,<br />\npractically everyone I spoke with<br />\nhad evaluated her and the course<br />\nsimilarly.<br />\nThe vast majority of students I<br />\nspoke with gave her a one or a<br />\ntwo on a scale of one to five (one<br />\nbeing the lowest), with absolutely no one giving her greater than<br />\na three. That in itself should show<br />\n<br />\nThe instructor<br />\nalways displayed an<br />\ndon't want to teach<br />\nlousy undergraduates'<br />\nattitude.<br />\nhow little respect she earned, as<br />\nalmost no professor in the Course<br />\nGuide receives lower than a four,<br />\nlet alone a three.<br />\nSo when the Course Guide appeared, I immediately turned to<br />\nthe Ecomonics section in search<br />\nof the review. Strangely enough,<br />\nit did not exist. Later, when I<br />\nasked an editor of the Course<br />\nGuide about this omission, he<br />\nreplied that Ms. Detragiache had<br />\nfailed to turn in the responses.<br />\nTheoretically, of course, professors don't look at the responses<br />\nto the evaluation forms; they<br />\nmerely turn them in to the Course<br />\nGuide. But it does seem strange<br />\nin this case that, in the face of<br />\nsuch an overwhelmingly negative<br />\nresponse, the evaluations were<br />\nnever received by the Course<br />\nGuide.<br />\nBut let's grant Ms. Detragiache<br />\nthe benefit of the doubt. Let's just<br />\nsay that the responses were \"lost<br />\nin the mail.\" Where they are<br />\ndoesn't make much of a difference right now. The point is<br />\nthis: There was no review of International Trade in the Course<br />\nGuide. So, for the benefit of those<br />\nwho might have mistakenly<br />\nenrolled in the course for next<br />\nsemester, here are just a few<br />\nthings to look for if you wind up<br />\ntaking the course:<br />\nInept, Indifferent Teaching.<br />\nFirst of all, Ms. Detragiache's<br />\nmathematical ability doesn't<br />\nstretch much beyond 2+2. On<br />\nthe first day of class last spring,<br />\nshe spent five minutes trying to<br />\nfigure out something as simple as<br />\n20-5.<br />\nShe was guaranteed to make at<br />\nleast one major mistake per class<br />\n(usually around the 40-minute<br />\nmark). Sometimes she would<br />\nlater go back and correct herself.<br />\nSometimes she wouldn't. When<br />\nshe didn't, it wasn't her concern<br />\nto correct herself; she left it to the<br />\nstudents to search in the textbook<br />\nfor the correct answers.<br />\nOn top of this, she continually<br />\ndisplayed a contemptous \"I don't<br />\nwant to teach you lousy<br />\nundergraduates\" attitude. She obviously didn't care about teaching<br />\nus.<br />\nTA's Who Can't Understand<br />\nEnglish. Last year, of the two<br />\nteaching assistants, one spoke<br />\nEnglish adequately, while the<br />\nother could barely complete a<br />\nsentence, let alone understand full<br />\nparagraphs when grading. The<br />\n<br />\nformer, Vandana Chandra, will<br />\nteach International Monetary<br />\nEconomy this spring, so she<br />\nshouldn't be returning. As for the<br />\nlatter, Hideaki Mori. .<br />\nI'll just let the following speak<br />\nfor itself. I had questions about<br />\nthe grading of three questions on<br />\nthe midterm. Ms. Detrigiache insisted we submit questions in<br />\nwriting instead of speaking to her<br />\nor the TA's personally. Here is<br />\nMr. Mori's verbatim response to<br />\nqueries:<br />\nmy<br />\nof<br />\none<br />\nTo Ms. Kevin McCrea:<br />\nOn number 5. Your answer is<br />\ncomplete mistake. What me want<br />\nto answer is how you know the<br />\nslope. You said nothing on it. (i.e.<br />\nhow demand and supply change<br />\nas price change as that result you<br />\nknow the slope) And this critetior<br />\nis applyed whole student. I'm<br />\nsorry. I may be too severe or may<br />\n<br />\nThis lack of command of the<br />\nEnglish language led to yet<br />\nanother problem. . .<br />\nRandom Grading. Ms.<br />\nDetriagiache encouraged students<br />\nto do their homework together.<br />\nThis was a necessity, as neither<br />\nshe nor the TA's wanted to help<br />\nstudents with questions about<br />\nassignments. As a result, students<br />\nwho worked together on their<br />\nhomework wound up with very<br />\nsimilar results.<br />\nYet students received vastly<br />\ndiffering grades for essentially the<br />\nsame answers. One student<br />\nreported that he received an 80 on<br />\none assignment, for example,<br />\nwhile the person who worked<br />\nwith him and had the same<br />\nanswers received only a 60. All<br />\n<br />\nli<br />\ny<br />\n<br />\neir<br />\n<br />\nnot. Anyway me have to keep consistency. I can't give you point on<br />\nnumber 5.<br />\n<br />\nAIM<br />\n<br />\nwas cold-blooded.\"<br />\n\u2014\"She was unorganized, inept, and basically a lousy teacher.<br />\nEvery student should avoid her in<br />\nany class.\"<br />\nSo my advice? Don't take this<br />\n\u2022 class. Find an alternative for IR<br />\nEconomics requirements for next<br />\n(at least two exist) or<br />\nsemester<br />\nAnother classroom disaster that<br />\npass on economics for the<br />\nconveniently avoided publication<br />\nsemester and hope that someone<br />\nin the Economics Department<br />\nin the Course Guide.<br />\ntakes note of Ms. Detragiache's<br />\nexceptional lack of teaching<br />\n\u2014\"The only thing I kept ask- ability.<br />\nfigure out what whoever graded<br />\nAnd if you do wind up taking<br />\nmy paper meant, and I knew that ingmyself as I took this class was,<br />\nfor<br />\nsome reason, forget class<br />\nit<br />\nany complaints about the grading 'I can't believe that she's a prothe textbook exnotes\u2014use<br />\nwould have been met by Ms. fessor at this school.' She ran<br />\nculsively.<br />\nThis<br />\nwas the only good<br />\neverything<br />\nI<br />\nexpected<br />\nof<br />\nagainst<br />\nDetragiache with shrugs<br />\npart of the course. It clearly exfrom Hopkins.\"<br />\nindifference.<br />\n\u2014\"She wasn't very helpful to plained what Ms. Detragiache<br />\nBut don't take this as a sole student's sour grapes. As I wrote individual students' needs. She jumbled. By the end of the<br />\nthis column, I asked various covered the material in an in- semester students relied on the<br />\nbook much more than they did on<br />\nstudents who took the course credibly unclear manner yet the<br />\nwhat they felt about International grading was still harsh.. .She class notes.<br />\n<br />\nof this came with a C+ curve<br />\nfound in the course.<br />\nBy the end of the semester I<br />\nhad given up hope of trying to<br />\nfigure out what I had done wrong<br />\nI couldn't<br />\non anassignment.<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nTrade. Without a single exception, they also condemned both<br />\nthe teacher and the course. Here's<br />\na sample of what these students<br />\nhad to say about the class and the<br />\nprofessor:<br />\n<br />\nScrew the Right Thing<br />\nOn Tuesday evening the Gay<br />\nand Lesbian Alliance held a rally outside to call attention to the<br />\nconflict between the University's<br />\nnon-discrimination policy and the<br />\nDepartment of Defense's policy<br />\nof excluding homosexuals, which<br />\nmanifests itself on campus in the<br />\nform of the ROTC program.<br />\nA protest on campus is a rare<br />\nthing for Hopkins, and the reaction to it was inadequate. Students<br />\nwere treated poorly, or mistreated<br />\noutright.<br />\nAs a member of GALA,I was<br />\nparticipating in the protest in a<br />\nhighly visible way and was one<br />\nof those mistreated. As part of a<br />\ngroup making legitimate demands<br />\nof the administration, this account<br />\nis a personal view, and one that<br />\nis bound to be emotionally<br />\ncharged and hyperbolic.<br />\nI was strangled by a University employee. This person is a<br />\nmember of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSecurity force, and his action is<br />\nintolerable for several reasons<br />\nbeyond the fact that the attack was<br />\nunprovoked.<br />\nAlthough I was a part of the<br />\nrally protesting the administration's decisions not to enforce its<br />\nanti-discrimination policy regarding the ROTC program on campus, I was, along with my fellow<br />\nprotestors, behaving responsibly,<br />\nin a non-violent act of civil<br />\ndisobedience.<br />\nEven before the protest officially began at Garland Hall on Mon-<br />\n<br />\nday afternoon, a member of<br />\nSecurity approached us in front<br />\nof Levering to question our use<br />\nof whistles, which he contended<br />\nwere to be used only in violent<br />\nemergencies. A member calmly<br />\nexplained that we consider<br />\ndiscrimination and homophobic<br />\nacts to be ones of violence requiring emergency attention.<br />\nLater we moved to Garland<br />\nHall, displaying signs and<br />\nposters, and began parading in a<br />\ncircle while chanting various<br />\nslogans, including \"Two, four,<br />\nsix, eight, Hopkins thinks the<br />\nworld is straight!\"<br />\nTo symbolize the feeling that<br />\nthe school is incorrectly and overly concerned with the $450<br />\nmillion Johns Hopkins receives<br />\nannually from the federal government, specifically the Pentagon,<br />\nI dressed in fatigues and led a<br />\nbound student, dressed in graduation robes, around inside the<br />\ncircle.<br />\nStill playing a mock military<br />\nfigure, I singled out individuals<br />\nfrom the protest and branded<br />\nthem with the Nazi-era symbol of<br />\npink<br />\nhomosexuality\u2014the<br />\ntriangle\u2014after which they fell<br />\ndown \"dead.\" Following their<br />\n\"deaths,\" the victims' bodies<br />\nwere outlined with pink chalk.<br />\nWhen one of the protestors attempted to enter Garland he ran<br />\ninto difficulty with Security.

In<br />\nlight of this fact, I have decided<br />\nto create the First Annual William<br />\n\"You Can Call Me William\"<br />\nRichardson List of Events and<br />\nNon-Events for the Year 1990.<br />\nLet me begin with the events.<br />\nI have defined the list of events<br />\nas things which actually had an<br />\nimpact on campus this year for a<br />\nperiod longer than 15 minutes.<br />\nEvent Number One: Men's<br />\nBasketball reaching the Sweet<br />\nSixteen. This even was significant<br />\nbecause Coach Nelson was able<br />\nto do something that even Jim<br />\nValvano could not do\u2014create a<br />\nprogram that is a contender<br />\nnationally.<br />\nEvent Number Two: First winning football season in five years.<br />\nNot to focus on the men exclusively, but Coach Margraff did<br />\none hell of a job and gave<br />\nWAWA something to be proud<br />\nof, finally.<br />\nEvent Number Three: President<br />\nMuller retiring.

Big<br />\nchanges are in the making for the<br />\nway students live at Hopkins.<br />\nEvent Number Five: Opening<br />\nof Bradford and Bloomberg.<br />\nPhysics and off-campus housing<br />\nenter the '90s.<br />\nEvent Number Six: President<br />\nBush's visit. Do you remember<br />\nwhat you were doing that day?<br />\nNow I would like to present the<br />\nlist of non-events. Non-events are<br />\nthose issues which were so<br />\nminiscule as to not warrant a list<br />\nof them.<br />\nNon-Event Number One: 1990<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse season. One can only<br />\nhope that our shameful performance, both on and off the field,<br />\nwill not be repeated.<br />\nNon-Event Number Two: Creation of a Women's Studies Program. The administration created<br />\nit because it was \"expected\"<br />\nfrom a school like Hopkins. Since<br />\nwhen should we follow the<br />\nstampede?<br />\nNon-Event Number Three:<br />\nROTC debate. In terms of<br />\npolitical awareness, Hopkins is<br />\ndecades behind the times. It's<br />\nfunny how the administration<br />\nwent to work on this one, while<br />\nleaving more fundamental issues<br />\nlike classroom size alone.<br />\nNon-Event Number Four: Pro-<br />\n<br />\nposed \"W\" requirement. Making sure that Hopkins graduates<br />\ncan write well is fine, but don't<br />\nstudents have better things to do<br />\nthan to take a class solely to fulfill<br />\na \"W\" requirement?<br />\nNon-Event Number Five: ReOpening of Evergreen House.<br />\nHave you ever heard of it, let<br />\nalone been there?<br />\nNon-Event Six: 1990 MSE<br />\nSymposium. A \"politically correct\" topic, but were enough<br />\nstudents interested?<br />\nFinally, I should mention two<br />\nevents that I could not decide<br />\nwhich list they belonged in.<br />\nUnknown Event One: Hubble<br />\nTelescope. Everyone reading this<br />\ncolumn will have graduated<br />\n<br />\nE-Level<br />\n<br />\nbefore it works correctly.<br />\nUnknown Event Two: WHOP<br />\nradio. A good idea that might not<br />\nwork because of a lack of funding. Watch to see if the senior<br />\nclass becomes a white knight to<br />\nget it on the air. Well, there you<br />\nhave it, the good and the bad. I<br />\nwonder what 1991's list will look<br />\nlike?<br />\nEds. note: One non-event that Brad<br />\nCohen overlooked was the disappearance of'Ego Dico'for the year,<br />\nas the columnist is going abroadfor<br />\nthe second semester.

She, along with<br />\nthe other \"cast members\" in the<br />\nhouse, work to bring you back to<br />\nthe era of the 1800s.<br />\nThe house consists of seven<br />\nrooms, with five open to the<br />\npublic.

It should correlate to the<br />\nlecture series in molecular cell<br />\nbiology and give the students real<br />\nresults revelant to the theories<br />\nthey learned in lecture.<br />\nUnfortunately, the lab is far<br />\nfrom ideal. Many students have<br />\nraised legitimate questions about<br />\nthis course. Questions about the<br />\nquality of the equipment in mole<br />\ncell lab; the problems that arise<br />\nin doing the experiments for this<br />\ncourse; and how well mole cell<br />\nlab prepares pre-meds for<br />\nmedical school frequently arise.<br />\nRegarding the quality of mole<br />\ncell lab equipment, one student<br />\nsaid, \"some of the equipment<br />\nlooks like its been around since<br />\nI was in kindergarten, like the<br />\nSpec 20's.\" Another student<br />\ncommented specifically on the<br />\nquality of the Spec 20's (spectrometers for taking absorption<br />\nreadings in the range of visible<br />\nlight): \"It's almost impossible to<br />\nget a stable reading on the Spec<br />\n20's, and the ones that do give<br />\nyou a stable reading are the ones<br />\nwhose needles are stuck in one<br />\nposition.\"<br />\nHomer responded to student<br />\ncomments about the Spec 20's<br />\n<br />\nsaying, \"one thing to remember<br />\nis that the electrical output of<br />\nvarious outlets in the lab fluctuate.\" As for the needles,<br />\nHomer suggested that students<br />\n\"tap the reading display to get<br />\nthem unstuck.\"<br />\nHe continued, \"For readings<br />\nand analyses we do in the lab,<br />\nthese Spec 20's are just fine.<br />\nNewer Spec 20's wouldn't give<br />\nbetter results.

Homer cited the fact that it<br />\nwould cost about $18,000 to adequately set up the lab with<br />\nmicropipetters and that he could<br />\n\"easily see losing five a week.\"<br />\nWith each micropipetter costing<br />\naround $200 a piece, this could<br />\nget very expensive. Horner<br />\nadded, \"If a glass breaks it costs<br />\nonly $3 to $4 to replace.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the quality<br />\nof the equipment in mole cell lab,<br />\nhead T.A. Lisa Hanan said, \"It's<br />\nsad that some of the Spec 20's<br />\ndon't work, [but] some of the<br />\nequipment is phenomenal, such<br />\nas the type of microscopes and the<br />\nultraviolet spectrometers.\"<br />\nLast spring there was an experiment that was intended to last<br />\nonly four hours. It lasted all night<br />\nand produced no results. Homer<br />\nadmits that there have been problems in getting results from some<br />\nof the experiments. He points out<br />\nthat the lab manual he inherited<br />\nwhen he became professor for<br />\n<br />\nthis lab was in a sorry state.<br />\n\"Last year a student did an independent study on anaerobic<br />\nmetabolism and found six<br />\nseparate variables ignored in the<br />\nlab manual that were important,\"<br />\nHomer said. These variables<br />\nneeded to be known in order to<br />\nget any results whatsoever.<br />\nHe then cited that 60 percent of<br />\nthe anaerobic metabolism experiments produced results this<br />\nyear, compared to no results from<br />\nlast year. While this is admittedly an improvement, it still leaves<br />\nroughly 40 percent of the students<br />\nwith an experiment that they<br />\nsweated over four to five hours<br />\nthat garnered no usable results.<br />\nIn talking about the problems<br />\nwith the experiments in this<br />\ncourse, head T.A.

In<br />\nthe salt, the molecular species exist in two kinds of stacks: one<br />\ncontaining solely TTF mottcules,<br />\nthe other containing TCNQ<br />\nmolecules. This gives rise to the<br />\nterm segregated stacking. The<br />\nhigh conductivity of TTF-TCNQ<br />\nis along these stacks because of<br />\nthe interactions of TTF and<br />\nTCNQ.<br />\nThe potential for applying this<br />\nknowledge to the next generation<br />\nof electronic devices and energy<br />\nconversion systems is enormous.<br />\nAlthough it is too early to tell, it<br />\nmay be possible for organic<br />\norganic-based materials to replace<br />\ninorganic compounds such as<br />\nsilicon geranium.<br />\nAnother possible application of<br />\nthis research lies in the area of<br />\nsuperconductivity. An organic<br />\ncompound was found to be a<br />\nat<br />\nlow<br />\nsuperconductor<br />\ntemperature(temp=8k)under normal pressures.

I feel that it is<br />\nunnecessary to try to canvass the<br />\nother schools when I've been told<br />\nthat the ECAC supports allowing<br />\nDivision III schools to play up in<br />\na sport. We have well over a majority there.\"<br />\nA potential flaw in Scott's<br />\nargument is that he is assuming<br />\nthat each individual ECAC school<br />\nwill support every position that<br />\nthe ECAC takes collectively. Joe<br />\nBoylan, Assistant Director of<br />\nAthletics at Rutgers University,<br />\nwhich not only plays Division I<br />\nlacrosse, but is a member of the<br />\nECAC, stated that this is not<br />\nnecessarily the case. \"Many<br />\nschools have not even discussed<br />\nthe proposal yet, so they definitely wouldn't have expressed an<br />\nobjection to something they<br />\nhaven't discussed collectively.<br />\nWe at Rutgers haven't gone over<br />\nthe proposal yet, but we plan to<br />\ndo so next week.\"<br />\n\"I would imagine that many of<br />\nthe schools would have no objection to Hopkins staying in Division I in lacrosse,\" Boylan<br />\nspeculated, \"but the northeastern<br />\nschools probably have more of an<br />\nidea of what Johns Hopkins<br />\nmeans to lacrosse, because<br />\nlacrosse is not played nationwide.<br />\nBut by no means is it safe to<br />\n<br />\nassume that every ECAC school<br />\nwill vote based on the sentiment<br />\nexpressed by the ECAC as a<br />\nwhole.

But<br />\nthe schools who spend the money<br />\nto maintain all Division I sports<br />\nfeel it is unfair.<br />\n\"Proposal 86 is going to affect<br />\nschools like the University of<br />\nDayton, Hofstra University, and<br />\nGeorgetown,\" commented<br />\nCalder. \"It would also affect<br />\nBloomsburg, which is a Division<br />\nII school that plays down at Division III field hockey.

It is with a tinge of<br />\nsadness, then, that I make this<br />\nannouncement: this will be the<br />\nfinal injury of the week. Now,<br />\ndon't you all bawl at once;<br />\neven the most enthusiastic<br />\nIOTW fan has to admit that<br />\nthis column is getting painfully old (I do, and I write this<br />\nthing). To those of you who<br />\nthis<br />\ndescribe<br />\nwould<br />\nphenomenon in harsher terms,<br />\nI say: shut the hell up. To limit<br />\nthe wave of anxiety following<br />\nIOTW's painful finale (its<br />\nemotional impact should be<br />\nroughly equivalent to the tearful outbursts provoked by the<br />\nfinal episode of M*A*S*H), I<br />\nhad the herculean task of finding an injury which would incite the interest of young and<br />\nold, athletic and spastic, stoic<br />\nand whiney, alike.<br />\nAnd here it is, the injury<br />\nwhich transcends every<br />\nsegmentation mechanism: tendonitis. In a final burst of<br />\nmagnanimity, I will explain<br />\nthis common malady. So simple, yet so insidious, tendonitis<br />\nis one of the worst recurring<br />\nproblems in sports medicine.<br />\nIt perpetuates itself in that the<br />\nmore one exercises, the more<br />\n<br />\nthe pain subsides. The<br />\nunderlying problem, however,<br />\nfesters while the pain is latent.<br />\nTendonitis, an inflammation of<br />\nany tendon which causes tendon fibers to swell, is caused<br />\nby tight muscles. The forms of<br />\ntendonitis vary according to<br />\nthe action you perform. All<br />\nforms, however, exhibit the<br />\nsame progression: they hurt<br />\n<br />\nfor proper treatment. First,<br />\nstop all hard exercise. In a few<br />\ndays, being gradual, gently do<br />\nstretching exercises. Keep<br />\nyour motions simple and<br />\nsmooth; jerky stretches often<br />\ncause further damage. Steroid<br />\nuse will not relieve tendonitis,<br />\nit will only mask the pain.<br />\n<br />\nSo. That's it, that's all, hope<br />\nyou've enjoyed your stay. I've<br />\nhad a blast spewing IOTW, a<br />\nreflection of my deep-seeded<br />\n. confusion (I'm a senior, you<br />\nknow), into the public realm.<br />\nI know that we've faithfully<br />\npursued our original mission<br />\nto: \"Plunge head first into the<br />\nmurky, but ultimately rewarding, waters of sports<br />\nmedicine.\" Ooh, it gives me<br />\nthe chills.

What is<br />\nthe purpose of the IFC\u2014to find<br />\nout what is the truth and what<br />\nhappened or to make amends- with<br />\nthe community?<br />\nI think their role is to represent<br />\nthe fraternity Greek system in the<br />\nbest way they know how, and I<br />\nthink [in terms of the TEP decision that] they did that. And that<br />\nwas their main goal. In that case,<br />\nand in any case I've dealt with<br />\nthem, they're trying to do what's<br />\nthe right thing for the whole<br />\nsystem, and they're looking at the<br />\nbig picture.<br /><br />\nErrata<br /><br />\nWhat is new or different about<br />\nthe .\"new judicial system?\"<br />\nIt's a separate board. The past<br />\njudicial board were all presidents<br />\nof the fraternities, and the IFC<br />\npresident oversaw the proceedings. Now, there are seven<br />\nmembers of the judicial board and<br />\nnone ofthem are presidents of the<br />\nfraternities. We're doing it on a<br />\nrotating basis. So that one year<br />\nyou may not be on it, but the next<br />\nyear, your group will be<br />\nrepresented. It's a smaller, more<br />\nmanageable board, selected from<br />\nthe fraternities. Then, the entire<br />\nIFC has voted on a judicial board<br />\nchairperson. That's one of the<br />\nmajor things. The proceedings<br />\nitself, I think, offer more due process than what we had in the past.<br />\nFor instance, if I was informed<br />\nof an incident that occurred, I<br />\nwould state what information I<br />\nhad, and then, the group might<br />\nhave some rebuttal to that. At that<br />\npoint, my advising role is really<br />\nover; I would leave. I think it will<br />\nbe more effective, as well,<br />\nbecause the presidents have so<br />\nmany other things going on. Plus,<br />\nto be honest, there are more<br />\npolitical things that happen, I<br />\nthink, when you have that kind of<br />\ngroup. And this may not<br />\neliminate that, but I think it will<br />\nlessen it.<br /><br />\n- Continued from page 1<br />\nsmoke-free environments, he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nUltimately the goal of the committee is to provide a healthier environment for all smokers as well<br />\nas non-smokers, he said. According to Gabor,\"The smoke free<br />\npolicy will be welcomed by most<br />\nat Johns Hopkins because the<br />\ndangers of smoking are, quite<br />\nsimply, fatal. Each year in<br />\nAmerica, 360,000 people die<br />\nbecause of nicotine related illnesses.

Mind<br />\nyou, there was no rational reason<br />\nthat she couldn't sleep. She<br />\nhadn't taken any nasal<br />\ndecongestants that reregulated<br />\nyour schedule so that even though<br />\nyou felt better you still missed<br />\nclass. She hadn't suddenly been<br />\nstruck by the realization that<br />\nRosebud was the sled (she had<br />\npicked up on that, thank you).<br />\nShe didn't even have Zack's<br />\neleventh-hour exam dread; she<br />\nknew she was all right\u2014she<br />\ndidn't have to stay up about it.<br />\nIn truth, Miranda had a malady<br />\nthat afflicted many a cresscountry enrollee; she was stuck<br />\nwith a case of pre-jet lag. Pre-jet<br />\nlag is what Miranda termed her<br />\nsubconscious readjustment of<br />\nschedule in the week before she<br />\nwent home. The pent-up longing<br />\nfor family, friends, and well,<br />\nDavid exhibited themselves in her<br />\nstaying up later each night as her<br />\ndeparture date got closer. Usually, when she got home, she was<br />\nalready on California time.<br />\nUnfortunately, that did her no<br />\ngood at 4:01 on the east coast.<br />\nShe looked again. 4:02.<br />\nThat line of thought took<br />\naltogether too short a time, she<br />\nmused. There had to be<br />\nsomething to get her to sleep.<br />\nWithout shrinking her mucus<br />\nmembranes, that is.<br />\nShe heard a shuffling from the<br />\nhall. Still 4:02. She figured that<br />\nshe might as well go see who else<br />\nwas up because that time sure<br />\nwasn't going to change if she sat<br />\nthere and waited for it.<br />\nNo big surprise; it was Zack.<br />\n\"Hi, Miranda,\" he groaned.<br />\nBy the last week of school, Zack<br />\nwould have said \"I just got a date<br />\nwith Winona Ryder\" with a<br />\ngroan. Zack was facing the<br />\nrevenge of the semester, an inevitable outshoot of his scholarly policy: \"If you ignore it, it'll<br />\ngo away.\"<br />\n\"How's History of Death com-<br /><br />\n'If I go to page four,'<br />\nZack said with panic,<br />\n'Russia is Communist<br />\nand France is taken<br />\nover by Yugoslavia!'<br />\ning?\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"I'm on page three,\" Zack<br />\ngroaned. \u2014The exam is tomorrow<br />\nand I haven't gone to class and<br />\nI skipped all my sections and I<br />\nhave to learn it all tonight and I'm<br />\non page three and it's four in the<br />\nmorning.\"<br />\n\"Four oh-two,\" Miranda<br />\ncorrected.<br />\n\"Oh God,\" Zack groaned. \"I<br />\nshould be on chapter seven by<br />\nnow!\"<br />\n\"What chapter are you on?\"<br />\nMiranda asked.<br />\nBy now Zack's moaning has<br />\ngiven way to manic terror. \"I'm<br />\non page three! I told you I was<br />\non page three! I'm on page three<br />\nand my exam is tomorrow at nine<br />\nand it's four in the morning and<br />\nI can't for the life of me<br />\nremember what was on page one<br />\nand two! Aaaaargh!\"<br />\nMiranda half-mindedly took<br />\nDoris' cup out of the microwave<br />\nand started to fill her own mug<br />\nwith water.<br />\n\"Maybe you should skip page<br />\nthree. Move on to something later<br />\nin the chapter. Like page four.\"<br />\n\"Sure!\" Zack screamed silently enough not to wake up Doris<br />\nor Carol. \"I go on to page four<br />\nbut then I don't know what went<br />\non on page three and Russia is<br />\nCommunist and France is taken<br />\nover by Yugoslavia an I don't<br />\neven know what happened to<br />\nCopernicus! What happened to<br />\nCopernicus, Miranda? What happened to him?\"<br />\nMiranda looked pityingly into<br />\nZack's exam-crazed eyes. \"He<br />\ndidn't make it, Zack. I'm sorry.\"<br />\nContinued on page 8<br /><br />\nAnother Department Suffers From Neglect<br />\nJohns Hopkins University may soon have one less academic field<br />\nin the School of Arts and Sciences in need of attention and oh-soprecious funds. Recently, the Department of Psychology experienced a series of blows that will prove fatal to social psychology at<br />\nHopkins and extremely debilitating to the Department of Psychology<br />\nfor at least several years. At its November 21 meeting, the Academic<br />\nCouncil did not approve a crucial appointment to the Psychology faculty. The appointment would have brought to Hopkins a prominent<br />\nsocial psychologist\u2014an asset desperately needed and long overdue.<br />\nIt is impossible to untangle the complicated factors that led to the<br />\nCouncil's decision to deny the appointment of William Crano, particulary as specifics are confidential. Clearly, however, there is a<br />\ndiscrepancy between the Department of Psychology's perception of<br />\nhis credentials and the Academic Council's. And in light of the<br />\nevidence that is available concerning Crano, the Council's decision<br />\nis controversial at best. Crano is popular among the students currently in his class and had the unreserved support of several faculty<br />\nmembers. In his work he has not always followed traditional academic<br />\ntrajectories\u2014did he simply fall outside of Hopkins' rigid definition<br />\nof what an academician should be?<br />\nThe Academic Council must occasionally act against the recommendations of a department in order to fulfill its responsibilities. But<br />\nin this case much more lay in the balance than a class for next semester<br />\n(entitled Attitudes and Social Change, to have been taught by Crano,<br />\nand for which many students were already pre-registered) and a senior<br />\nfaculty position which will presumably be filled next year. The field<br />\nof social psychology at Hopkins had already experienced several setbacks and was held together only tenuously. This most recent Council<br />\ndecision merely removed the last bolt standing in the way of swift<br />\ncollapse.<br />\nAt a meeting last spring, the Council denied tenure to Steven<br />\nBreckler. While Breckler will be recommended to the Council by<br />\nhis department again this winter, he may not wait around for the<br />\nresults. Neither will Paula Niedenthal. She and Breckler are currently<br />\nthe only social psychologists that are full-time faculty members.<br />\nWithin the last year the Department of Psychology said goodbye to<br />\nits other social psychologists: Professor Milton Strauss left Hopkins<br />\nfor another university, and Professor Clinton DeSoto retired.<br />\nUnder normal circumstances it would be unreasonable to expect<br />\nNiedenthal and Breckler to bear the burden of maintaining a respec-<br /><br />\ntable social psychology field for the University. In light of recent<br />\nslaps in the face by the Academic Council, it is ridiculous. Both<br />\nlegitimately question Hopkins' commitment to social psychology and<br />\nare looking for positions elsewhere. What sane faculty member would<br />\nstay at a university where he or she had no colleagues in his or her<br />\nfield (and little hope of any arriving soon) and where one sensed at<br />\nthe very least profound neglect toward one's field'?<br />\nAcademic Council member Ronald Walters attempted to explain<br />\nthe actions of the Council: \"The Council thinks that the social<br />\npsychology area is important, so we are basically telling the Department of Psychology to aim higher.\" His words are ironic\u2014the action that was to send the message \"aim higher\" crippled the field<br />\nhere at Hopkins to such an extent that the department will now be<br />\nlucky to \"hit\" any mark at all, much less a \"higher\" one. The greater<br />\nsocial psychology professional community is not likely to take the<br />\nword of the Johns Hopkins Academic Council over other more<br />\nprestigious and influential programs. Loyalty among colleagues will<br />\nmake it difficult for Hopkins to attract any social psychologist.<br />\nPolitics, budgets, and credentials aside, Hopkins students will immediately experience the affects this series of events. Social<br />\nPsychology classes are extremely popular. They draw capacity crowds<br />\neach semester and meet specific needs of not only psychology majors but of a large portion of the general student population as well.<br />\nStudents majoring in psychology need classes in social psychology<br />\nin order to have a credible academic record when applying to graduate<br />\nschools. And many non-majors take them because much of the<br />\nmaterial is accessible and relevant not just to many other disciplines<br />\nbut to non-academic matters also. It is unacceptable for students to<br />\nhave as their only resources in social psychology part-time, offcampus, evening faculty members teaching one-time-only courses.<br />\nBut the Department of Psychology will have to resort to such measures<br />\nin order to offer the bare minimum courses necessary.<br />\nIs it neglect or calculation? It is difficult to imagine a university<br />\nadministration purposely disabling an area as important as social<br />\npsychology. Though the advertised budget crisis may indeed have<br />\nbeen a factor, cutting off a(nother) limb will not solve the problem.<br />\nStudents suffer now, but ultimately the University as an institution<br />\nwill pay the price for its repeated instances of profound neglect in<br />\nfundamental academic fields.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nA Little History of Hopkins ROTC\u2014and Ideas for<br />\nThe Future; News-Letter Misses the Mark on Lecture<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nControversies regarding ROTC on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus might slacken<br />\nif ROTC were made an optional, extracurricular activity unsubsidized<br />\nby The Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe Academic Council on<br />\nNovember 24, 1967, decided that<br />\ncredits earned in Military Science<br />\nwere not to be counted toward fulfillment of the requirements for the BA<br />\nand BES degrees. That Academic<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\nCouncil decision was reinforced 11<br />\nyears later when a student poll showed that 51 percent of undergraduate<br />\nstudents believed that ROTC should<br />\nbe strictly extracurricular, 36 percent favored elimination from campus entirely, and 13 percent believed that the program should be<br />\ngiven academic status (Morning<br />\nSun, May 16, 1969). Finally, at its<br />\nmeeting of May 20, 1970, the<br />\nAcademic Council by unanimous<br />\nvote requested the Administration to<br />\n\"remove from ROTC the remaining<br />\ncontractural or other vestiges of<br />\nacademic status.\" The Army<br />\nbalked; the Administration quietly<br />\ncaved in to preserve its ROTC<br />\nscholarship dollars. In March, 1975<br />\nNonon<br />\nCommittee<br />\nthe<br />\nDepartmental Courses limited<br />\nROTC credits on the transcript to<br />\nfour per ROTC student, down from<br />\neight. This situation prevailed until<br />\nthe school year 1989-1990 when<br />\nROTC reinstituted an eight-credit,<br />\ntwo-year program. Certainly, all<br />\nthese credits from a pseudoacademic<br />\nappendage should be eliminated as<br />\nwell as the listings on Hopkins<br />\nacademic transcripts.<br />\nPhilip E. Hartman<br />\nWilliam D. Gill,<br />\nProfessor in Biology<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n1 would like to share my perspective on the debate about the compatibility of ROTC's exclusionary<br />\npolicy toward homosexuals and<br />\nHopkins' anti-discrimination clause.<br />\nWhen I was applying to graduate<br />\nprograms, I limited my applications<br />\nto schools which explicitly stated that<br />\nthey do not discriminate on the basis<br />\nof sexual orientation. I did not want<br />\nthis to become an issue which would<br />\ndistract me from my academic work.<br />\nI entered into a professional relationship with Johns Hopkins University, trusting that its administrators<br />\nwould keep their word.<br />\nSince beginning my studies at<br />\nHopkins, I am no longer confident<br />\nthat the administrators of this<br />\nUniversity are trustworthy. If<br />\nHopkins houses and sponsors classes<br />\nand a scholarship program which are<br />\nopen only to heterosexuals, then our<br />\nadministrators cannot claim that we<br />\ndo not discriminate\". . .on the basis<br />\nof. . . homosexuality. . .\"<br />\nThis hesitance of the University<br />\nadministration to stand by their own<br />\npolicies makes me nervous. What<br />\nother groups will be officially ex-<br /><br />\neluded from University programs?<br />\nWhat other programs will choose to<br />\nexclude students, faculty or staff on<br />\nthe basis of minority status? What<br />\nother policies will the University administration ignore in favor of a program that brings in money? I am no<br />\nlonger confident that I can believe<br /><br />\nthe responses of University administrators to these questions.<br />\nM. Frank Stluka<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Tuesday, December 4, I went<br />\nto the weekly meeting of the Student<br />\nCouncil (7:00 p.m., Shriver Board<br />\nRoom), which is open to all students.<br />\nAmongst ot:ier things discussed at<br />\nthis meeting was the issue of ROTC<br />\non campus. Since I am a student,<br />\nwho is neither homosexual nor in<br />\nROTC, yet knows people in both<br />\ngroups, I would like to make two<br />\nobservations.<br />\nFirst, if you read the University's<br />\npolicy on non-discrimination, it<br />\nspecifically states non-discrimination<br />\nagainst homosexuals. ROTC is an<br />\non-campus program which does not<br />\nallow homosexuals full participation.<br />\nThis conflict with University nondiscrimination policy could be ended either by phasing out on-campus<br />\nROTC or by removing the University's policy of not discriminating<br />\nagainst homosexuals. In my opinion,<br />\nthose in favor of keeping ROTC as<br />\nan on-campus program should simply state: \"Yes, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity discriminates against<br />\nhomosexuals, but so does the<br />\ngovernment. Anyway, they're different from us and don't deserve the<br />\nsame access to the programs.\"<br />\nSecond, I'd like to remind<br />\neveryone that discrimination was a<br />\nbig topic during last year's student<br />\ncouncil elections. In fact in the<br />\nMarch 2, 1990 issue of the NewsLetter, a statement by Bob Nelson<br />\nread: \"Well, I'm concerned about<br />\nthe 'bigger picture' at Hopkins and<br />\nit's `-isms': racism, sexism, and<br />\nhomophobia. I think it's time that we<br />\nmade an effort to produce a more<br />\ntolerant campus....I don't think<br />\nthere's a big problem, but I'd like to<br />\nsee a lot more discussion, because<br /><br />\nSaudi Arabia, the destabilization that<br />\nwould proceed a regional war, may<br />\nrequire a continued occupation and<br />\nmilitary presence in Saudi Arabia by<br />\nthe United States. His intent was to<br />\nbring to the attention of the United<br />\nStates the different possible ramifications of our actions. Additionally,<br />\nVan Home places an inaccurate emphasis on the Gulf Crisis. The lecture focused on the economic viability of a Palestinian state, and the explanations about the Gulf were a personal preface given as an aside.<br />\nVan Home states, \"Bainerman<br />\nadded, 'I would advocate [that<br />\nIsrael] leave Gaza tomorrow,<br />\nwithout preconditions. If the Palestinians want to create an unstable<br />\nsituation and kill each other, that is<br />\nperfectly fine with me and the majority of Israelis.' He said, 'EvenMichael J. Byrne tually, then Israel would have to go<br />\nback in and maintain order.\" These<br />\nsentences provide a clear illustration<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe would like to apologize to of irresponsible use of quotes.

For example, there is the Palestine Liberation Organizaa tremendous difference between tion as the 'Palestinian Liberation<br />\nVan Home's,\"There will be a con- Organization.'

Mr. Bainerman ex- paragraph similarly omits important<br />\nplained that as a result of the United political context. The closure,<br />\nStates' military presence now in \"We're not equal,\" does not refer<br />\nto personal equality as Van Home<br />\nimplies. Bainerman was referring to<br />\ndiplomatic power. He explained that<br />\nonly stable political entities can give<br />\nassurances necessary for diplomatic<br />\nproperty of the News-Letter.<br />\nrelations on equal standing.<br />\nMore importantly, Van Home's<br />\nLetters must be no more than<br />\nselective use of quotes failed to men350 words and signed by at<br />\ntion one of Bainerman's key points.<br />\nleast one person and no more<br />\nBainerman emphasized repeatedly<br />\nthan two persons.

A PiANr.-_- WirH<br />\nA<br />\nis ci our OF LOU<br />\nSi6N1. 1r)<br />\nI bowr<br />\nANK-FiNG.<br /><br />\nTHAT-<br /><br />\nLet me just state the purpose of<br />\nthis column very clearly here at<br />\nthe start Do not take International<br />\nTrade!<br />\nI made the mistake of taking<br />\nthis class last spring. So did a lot<br />\nof other students. Never in my<br />\ncareer at Hopkins have I encountered so many students who<br />\ndisplayed such anger with a<br />\ncourse and, more notably, with<br />\na professor.<br />\nBy the end of the semester, we<br />\ncouldn't wait to get our hands on<br />\nCourse Guide evaluation forms.<br />\nWe wanted to make sure that no<br />\none would make the same mistake<br />\nagain. We at least came into the<br />\ncourse unaware of what was to<br />\ncome, as no review of the class<br />\nhad existed for our benefit in last<br />\nyear's Course Guide.<br />\nAnd sure enough, on the last<br />\nday of class, we received our<br />\nevaluation forms. I certainly<br />\nraked the professor, Enrica<br />\nDetragiache, over the coals. So<br />\ndid the person next to me, as did<br />\nthe person next to him. In fact,<br />\npractically everyone I spoke with<br />\nhad evaluated her and the course<br />\nsimilarly.<br />\nThe vast majority of students I<br />\nspoke with gave her a one or a<br />\ntwo on a scale of one to five (one<br />\nbeing the lowest), with absolutely no one giving her greater than<br />\na three. That in itself should show<br /><br />\nThe instructor<br />\nalways displayed an<br />\ndon't want to teach<br />\nlousy undergraduates'<br />\nattitude.<br />\nhow little respect she earned, as<br />\nalmost no professor in the Course<br />\nGuide receives lower than a four,<br />\nlet alone a three.<br />\nSo when the Course Guide appeared, I immediately turned to<br />\nthe Ecomonics section in search<br />\nof the review. Strangely enough,<br />\nit did not exist. Later, when I<br />\nasked an editor of the Course<br />\nGuide about this omission, he<br />\nreplied that Ms. Detragiache had<br />\nfailed to turn in the responses.<br />\nTheoretically, of course, professors don't look at the responses<br />\nto the evaluation forms; they<br />\nmerely turn them in to the Course<br />\nGuide. But it does seem strange<br />\nin this case that, in the face of<br />\nsuch an overwhelmingly negative<br />\nresponse, the evaluations were<br />\nnever received by the Course<br />\nGuide.<br />\nBut let's grant Ms. Detragiache<br />\nthe benefit of the doubt. Let's just<br />\nsay that the responses were \"lost<br />\nin the mail.\" Where they are<br />\ndoesn't make much of a difference right now. The point is<br />\nthis: There was no review of International Trade in the Course<br />\nGuide. So, for the benefit of those<br />\nwho might have mistakenly<br />\nenrolled in the course for next<br />\nsemester, here are just a few<br />\nthings to look for if you wind up<br />\ntaking the course:<br />\nInept, Indifferent Teaching.<br />\nFirst of all, Ms. Detragiache's<br />\nmathematical ability doesn't<br />\nstretch much beyond 2+2. On<br />\nthe first day of class last spring,<br />\nshe spent five minutes trying to<br />\nfigure out something as simple as<br />\n20-5.<br />\nShe was guaranteed to make at<br />\nleast one major mistake per class<br />\n(usually around the 40-minute<br />\nmark). Sometimes she would<br />\nlater go back and correct herself.<br />\nSometimes she wouldn't. When<br />\nshe didn't, it wasn't her concern<br />\nto correct herself; she left it to the<br />\nstudents to search in the textbook<br />\nfor the correct answers.<br />\nOn top of this, she continually<br />\ndisplayed a contemptous \"I don't<br />\nwant to teach you lousy<br />\nundergraduates\" attitude. She obviously didn't care about teaching<br />\nus.<br />\nTA's Who Can't Understand<br />\nEnglish. Last year, of the two<br />\nteaching assistants, one spoke<br />\nEnglish adequately, while the<br />\nother could barely complete a<br />\nsentence, let alone understand full<br />\nparagraphs when grading. The<br /><br />\nformer, Vandana Chandra, will<br />\nteach International Monetary<br />\nEconomy this spring, so she<br />\nshouldn't be returning. As for the<br />\nlatter, Hideaki Mori. .<br />\nI'll just let the following speak<br />\nfor itself. I had questions about<br />\nthe grading of three questions on<br />\nthe midterm. Ms. Detrigiache insisted we submit questions in<br />\nwriting instead of speaking to her<br />\nor the TA's personally. Here is<br />\nMr. Mori's verbatim response to<br />\nqueries:<br />\nmy<br />\nof<br />\none<br />\nTo Ms. Kevin McCrea:<br />\nOn number 5. Your answer is<br />\ncomplete mistake. What me want<br />\nto answer is how you know the<br />\nslope. You said nothing on it. (i.e.<br />\nhow demand and supply change<br />\nas price change as that result you<br />\nknow the slope) And this critetior<br />\nis applyed whole student. I'm<br />\nsorry. I may be too severe or may<br /><br />\nThis lack of command of the<br />\nEnglish language led to yet<br />\nanother problem. . .<br />\nRandom Grading. Ms.<br />\nDetriagiache encouraged students<br />\nto do their homework together.<br />\nThis was a necessity, as neither<br />\nshe nor the TA's wanted to help<br />\nstudents with questions about<br />\nassignments. As a result, students<br />\nwho worked together on their<br />\nhomework wound up with very<br />\nsimilar results.<br />\nYet students received vastly<br />\ndiffering grades for essentially the<br />\nsame answers. One student<br />\nreported that he received an 80 on<br />\none assignment, for example,<br />\nwhile the person who worked<br />\nwith him and had the same<br />\nanswers received only a 60. All<br /><br />\nli<br />\ny<br /><br />\neir<br /><br />\nnot. Anyway me have to keep consistency. I can't give you point on<br />\nnumber 5.<br /><br />\nAIM<br /><br />\nwas cold-blooded.\"<br />\n\u2014\"She was unorganized, inept, and basically a lousy teacher.<br />\nEvery student should avoid her in<br />\nany class.\"<br />\nSo my advice? Don't take this<br />\n\u2022 class. Find an alternative for IR<br />\nEconomics requirements for next<br />\n(at least two exist) or<br />\nsemester<br />\nAnother classroom disaster that<br />\npass on economics for the<br />\nconveniently avoided publication<br />\nsemester and hope that someone<br />\nin the Economics Department<br />\nin the Course Guide.<br />\ntakes note of Ms. Detragiache's<br />\nexceptional lack of teaching<br />\n\u2014\"The only thing I kept ask- ability.<br />\nfigure out what whoever graded<br />\nAnd if you do wind up taking<br />\nmy paper meant, and I knew that ingmyself as I took this class was,<br />\nfor<br />\nsome reason, forget class<br />\nit<br />\nany complaints about the grading 'I can't believe that she's a prothe textbook exnotes\u2014use<br />\nwould have been met by Ms. fessor at this school.' She ran<br />\nculsively.<br />\nThis<br />\nwas the only good<br />\neverything<br />\nI<br />\nexpected<br />\nof<br />\nagainst<br />\nDetragiache with shrugs<br />\npart of the course. It clearly exfrom Hopkins.\"<br />\nindifference.<br />\n\u2014\"She wasn't very helpful to plained what Ms. Detragiache<br />\nBut don't take this as a sole student's sour grapes. As I wrote individual students' needs. She jumbled. By the end of the<br />\nthis column, I asked various covered the material in an in- semester students relied on the<br />\nbook much more than they did on<br />\nstudents who took the course credibly unclear manner yet the<br />\nwhat they felt about International grading was still harsh.. .She class notes.<br /><br />\nof this came with a C+ curve<br />\nfound in the course.<br />\nBy the end of the semester I<br />\nhad given up hope of trying to<br />\nfigure out what I had done wrong<br />\nI couldn't<br />\non anassignment.<br />\n_<br /><br />\nTrade. Without a single exception, they also condemned both<br />\nthe teacher and the course. Here's<br />\na sample of what these students<br />\nhad to say about the class and the<br />\nprofessor:<br /><br />\nScrew the Right Thing<br />\nOn Tuesday evening the Gay<br />\nand Lesbian Alliance held a rally outside to call attention to the<br />\nconflict between the University's<br />\nnon-discrimination policy and the<br />\nDepartment of Defense's policy<br />\nof excluding homosexuals, which<br />\nmanifests itself on campus in the<br />\nform of the ROTC program.<br />\nA protest on campus is a rare<br />\nthing for Hopkins, and the reaction to it was inadequate. Students<br />\nwere treated poorly, or mistreated<br />\noutright.<br />\nAs a member of GALA,I was<br />\nparticipating in the protest in a<br />\nhighly visible way and was one<br />\nof those mistreated. As part of a<br />\ngroup making legitimate demands<br />\nof the administration, this account<br />\nis a personal view, and one that<br />\nis bound to be emotionally<br />\ncharged and hyperbolic.<br />\nI was strangled by a University employee. This person is a<br />\nmember of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSecurity force, and his action is<br />\nintolerable for several reasons<br />\nbeyond the fact that the attack was<br />\nunprovoked.<br />\nAlthough I was a part of the<br />\nrally protesting the administration's decisions not to enforce its<br />\nanti-discrimination policy regarding the ROTC program on campus, I was, along with my fellow<br />\nprotestors, behaving responsibly,<br />\nin a non-violent act of civil<br />\ndisobedience.<br />\nEven before the protest officially began at Garland Hall on Mon-<br /><br />\nday afternoon, a member of<br />\nSecurity approached us in front<br />\nof Levering to question our use<br />\nof whistles, which he contended<br />\nwere to be used only in violent<br />\nemergencies. A member calmly<br />\nexplained that we consider<br />\ndiscrimination and homophobic<br />\nacts to be ones of violence requiring emergency attention.<br />\nLater we moved to Garland<br />\nHall, displaying signs and<br />\nposters, and began parading in a<br />\ncircle while chanting various<br />\nslogans, including \"Two, four,<br />\nsix, eight, Hopkins thinks the<br />\nworld is straight!\"<br />\nTo symbolize the feeling that<br />\nthe school is incorrectly and overly concerned with the $450<br />\nmillion Johns Hopkins receives<br />\nannually from the federal government, specifically the Pentagon,<br />\nI dressed in fatigues and led a<br />\nbound student, dressed in graduation robes, around inside the<br />\ncircle.<br />\nStill playing a mock military<br />\nfigure, I singled out individuals<br />\nfrom the protest and branded<br />\nthem with the Nazi-era symbol of<br />\npink<br />\nhomosexuality\u2014the<br />\ntriangle\u2014after which they fell<br />\ndown \"dead.\" Following their<br />\n\"deaths,\" the victims' bodies<br />\nwere outlined with pink chalk.<br />\nWhen one of the protestors attempted to enter Garland he ran<br />\ninto difficulty with Security.

In<br />\nlight of this fact, I have decided<br />\nto create the First Annual William<br />\n\"You Can Call Me William\"<br />\nRichardson List of Events and<br />\nNon-Events for the Year 1990.<br />\nLet me begin with the events.<br />\nI have defined the list of events<br />\nas things which actually had an<br />\nimpact on campus this year for a<br />\nperiod longer than 15 minutes.<br />\nEvent Number One: Men's<br />\nBasketball reaching the Sweet<br />\nSixteen. This even was significant<br />\nbecause Coach Nelson was able<br />\nto do something that even Jim<br />\nValvano could not do\u2014create a<br />\nprogram that is a contender<br />\nnationally.<br />\nEvent Number Two: First winning football season in five years.<br />\nNot to focus on the men exclusively, but Coach Margraff did<br />\none hell of a job and gave<br />\nWAWA something to be proud<br />\nof, finally.<br />\nEvent Number Three: President<br />\nMuller retiring.

Do you remember<br />\nwhat you were doing that day?<br />\nNow I would like to present the<br />\nlist of non-events. Non-events are<br />\nthose issues which were so<br />\nminiscule as to not warrant a list<br />\nof them.<br />\nNon-Event Number One: 1990<br /><br />\nLacrosse season. One can only<br />\nhope that our shameful performance, both on and off the field,<br />\nwill not be repeated.<br />\nNon-Event Number Two: Creation of a Women's Studies Program. The administration created<br />\nit because it was \"expected\"<br />\nfrom a school like Hopkins. Since<br />\nwhen should we follow the<br />\nstampede?<br />\nNon-Event Number Three:<br />\nROTC debate. In terms of<br />\npolitical awareness, Hopkins is<br />\ndecades behind the times. It's<br />\nfunny how the administration<br />\nwent to work on this one, while<br />\nleaving more fundamental issues<br />\nlike classroom size alone.<br />\nNon-Event Number Four: Pro-<br /><br />\nposed \"W\" requirement. Making sure that Hopkins graduates<br />\ncan write well is fine, but don't<br />\nstudents have better things to do<br />\nthan to take a class solely to fulfill<br />\na \"W\" requirement?<br />\nNon-Event Number Five: ReOpening of Evergreen House.<br />\nHave you ever heard of it, let<br />\nalone been there?<br />\nNon-Event Six: 1990 MSE<br />\nSymposium. A \"politically correct\" topic, but were enough<br />\nstudents interested?<br />\nFinally, I should mention two<br />\nevents that I could not decide<br />\nwhich list they belonged in.<br />\nUnknown Event One: Hubble<br />\nTelescope. Everyone reading this<br />\ncolumn will have graduated<br /><br />\nE-Level<br /><br />\nbefore it works correctly.<br />\nUnknown Event Two: WHOP<br />\nradio. A good idea that might not<br />\nwork because of a lack of funding. Watch to see if the senior<br />\nclass becomes a white knight to<br />\nget it on the air. Well, there you<br />\nhave it, the good and the bad.

She, along with<br />\nthe other \"cast members\" in the<br />\nhouse, work to bring you back to<br />\nthe era of the 1800s.<br />\nThe house consists of seven<br />\nrooms, with five open to the<br />\npublic. A tour of the house begins<br />\nin a small cloak room, which used to be a grocery store run by<br />\nthe woman of the house. In this<br />\nroom, an oil painting of a street<br />\nscene from 1840 covers one of<br />\nthe walls.<br />\nFrom here, the tour goes<br />\ndirectly up to the second floor,<br />\nwhich consists of the master<br />\nbedroom and the children's<br />\nroom. The master bedroom is<br />\nfurnished with a bed, a fireplace,<br />\nand a chamberpot. The decor is<br />\na simple blue and yellow pattern<br />\nwhich follows the edges of the<br />\nfireplace and the walls.

It should correlate to the<br />\nlecture series in molecular cell<br />\nbiology and give the students real<br />\nresults revelant to the theories<br />\nthey learned in lecture.<br />\nUnfortunately, the lab is far<br />\nfrom ideal. Many students have<br />\nraised legitimate questions about<br />\nthis course. Questions about the<br />\nquality of the equipment in mole<br />\ncell lab; the problems that arise<br />\nin doing the experiments for this<br />\ncourse; and how well mole cell<br />\nlab prepares pre-meds for<br />\nmedical school frequently arise.<br />\nRegarding the quality of mole<br />\ncell lab equipment, one student<br />\nsaid, \"some of the equipment<br />\nlooks like its been around since<br />\nI was in kindergarten, like the<br />\nSpec 20's.\" Another student<br />\ncommented specifically on the<br />\nquality of the Spec 20's (spectrometers for taking absorption<br />\nreadings in the range of visible<br />\nlight): \"It's almost impossible to<br />\nget a stable reading on the Spec<br />\n20's, and the ones that do give<br />\nyou a stable reading are the ones<br />\nwhose needles are stuck in one<br />\nposition.\"<br />\nHomer responded to student<br />\ncomments about the Spec 20's<br /><br />\nsaying, \"one thing to remember<br />\nis that the electrical output of<br />\nvarious outlets in the lab fluctuate.\" As for the needles,<br />\nHomer suggested that students<br />\n\"tap the reading display to get<br />\nthem unstuck.\"<br />\nHe continued, \"For readings<br />\nand analyses we do in the lab,<br />\nthese Spec 20's are just fine.<br />\nNewer Spec 20's wouldn't give<br />\nbetter results. If it [the current<br />\nmodel] does the job, then that's<br />\ngreat.\"<br />\n\"What about micropipetters<br />\nfor the lab?\". . .ask many<br />\nstudents who are familiar with<br />\ntheir use from other professors'<br />\nlabs. Homer cited the fact that it<br />\nwould cost about $18,000 to adequately set up the lab with<br />\nmicropipetters and that he could<br />\n\"easily see losing five a week.\"<br />\nWith each micropipetter costing<br />\naround $200 a piece, this could<br />\nget very expensive. Horner<br />\nadded, \"If a glass breaks it costs<br />\nonly $3 to $4 to replace.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the quality<br />\nof the equipment in mole cell lab,<br />\nhead T.A. Lisa Hanan said, \"It's<br />\nsad that some of the Spec 20's<br />\ndon't work, [but] some of the<br />\nequipment is phenomenal, such<br />\nas the type of microscopes and the<br />\nultraviolet spectrometers.\"<br />\nLast spring there was an experiment that was intended to last<br />\nonly four hours. It lasted all night<br />\nand produced no results. Homer<br />\nadmits that there have been problems in getting results from some<br />\nof the experiments. He points out<br />\nthat the lab manual he inherited<br />\nwhen he became professor for<br /><br />\nthis lab was in a sorry state.<br />\n\"Last year a student did an independent study on anaerobic<br />\nmetabolism and found six<br />\nseparate variables ignored in the<br />\nlab manual that were important,\"<br />\nHomer said. These variables<br />\nneeded to be known in order to<br />\nget any results whatsoever.<br />\nHe then cited that 60 percent of<br />\nthe anaerobic metabolism experiments produced results this<br />\nyear, compared to no results from<br />\nlast year. While this is admittedly an improvement, it still leaves<br />\nroughly 40 percent of the students<br />\nwith an experiment that they<br />\nsweated over four to five hours<br />\nthat garnered no usable results.<br />\nIn talking about the problems<br />\nwith the experiments in this<br />\ncourse, head T.A.

We have well over a majority there.\"<br />\nA potential flaw in Scott's<br />\nargument is that he is assuming<br />\nthat each individual ECAC school<br />\nwill support every position that<br />\nthe ECAC takes collectively. Joe<br />\nBoylan, Assistant Director of<br />\nAthletics at Rutgers University,<br />\nwhich not only plays Division I<br />\nlacrosse, but is a member of the<br />\nECAC, stated that this is not<br />\nnecessarily the case. \"Many<br />\nschools have not even discussed<br />\nthe proposal yet, so they definitely wouldn't have expressed an<br />\nobjection to something they<br />\nhaven't discussed collectively.<br />\nWe at Rutgers haven't gone over<br />\nthe proposal yet, but we plan to<br />\ndo so next week.\"<br />\n\"I would imagine that many of<br />\nthe schools would have no objection to Hopkins staying in Division I in lacrosse,\" Boylan<br />\nspeculated, \"but the northeastern<br />\nschools probably have more of an<br />\nidea of what Johns Hopkins<br />\nmeans to lacrosse, because<br />\nlacrosse is not played nationwide.<br />\nBut by no means is it safe to<br /><br />\nassume that every ECAC school<br />\nwill vote based on the sentiment<br />\nexpressed by the ECAC as a<br />\nwhole.

It is with a tinge of<br />\nsadness, then, that I make this<br />\nannouncement: this will be the<br />\nfinal injury of the week. Now,<br />\ndon't you all bawl at once;<br />\neven the most enthusiastic<br />\nIOTW fan has to admit that<br />\nthis column is getting painfully old (I do, and I write this<br />\nthing). To those of you who<br />\nthis<br />\ndescribe<br />\nwould<br />\nphenomenon in harsher terms,<br />\nI say: shut the hell up. To limit<br />\nthe wave of anxiety following<br />\nIOTW's painful finale (its<br />\nemotional impact should be<br />\nroughly equivalent to the tearful outbursts provoked by the<br />\nfinal episode of M*A*S*H), I<br />\nhad the herculean task of finding an injury which would incite the interest of young and<br />\nold, athletic and spastic, stoic<br />\nand whiney, alike.<br />\nAnd here it is, the injury<br />\nwhich transcends every<br />\nsegmentation mechanism: tendonitis. In a final burst of<br />\nmagnanimity, I will explain<br />\nthis common malady. So simple, yet so insidious, tendonitis<br />\nis one of the worst recurring<br />\nproblems in sports medicine.<br />\nIt perpetuates itself in that the<br />\nmore one exercises, the more<br /><br />\nthe pain subsides. The<br />\nunderlying problem, however,<br />\nfesters while the pain is latent.<br />\nTendonitis, an inflammation of<br />\nany tendon which causes tendon fibers to swell, is caused<br />\nby tight muscles. The forms of<br />\ntendonitis vary according to<br />\nthe action you perform. All<br />\nforms, however, exhibit the<br />\nsame progression: they hurt<br /><br />\nfor proper treatment. First,<br />\nstop all hard exercise. In a few<br />\ndays, being gradual, gently do<br />\nstretching exercises. Keep<br />\nyour motions simple and<br />\nsmooth; jerky stretches often<br />\ncause further damage. Steroid<br />\nuse will not relieve tendonitis,<br />\nit will only mask the pain.<br /><br />\nSo. That's it, that's all, hope<br />\nyou've enjoyed your stay. I've<br />\nhad a blast spewing IOTW, a<br />\nreflection of my deep-seeded<br />\n. confusion (I'm a senior, you<br />\nknow), into the public realm.<br />\nI know that we've faithfully<br />\npursued our original mission<br />\nto: \"Plunge head first into the<br />\nmurky, but ultimately rewarding, waters of sports<br />\nmedicine.\" Ooh, it gives me<br />\nthe chills. By the way, it has<br />\nbeen rumored that some<br />\nungrateful sports section staffers have considered continuing IOTW without me.
