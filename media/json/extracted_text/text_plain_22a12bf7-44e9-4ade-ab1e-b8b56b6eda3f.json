The newlyformed SOU disagrees with the Strike Committee mainly on the issue of banning recruiters.<br />\nThe Strike Committee plans a meeting at<br />\n3 P.M. today to work on the referendum. The<br />\nSOU and strikers will also meet today with<br />\nBenton to discuss governance.

Benton met yesterday morning with<br />\n10 representatives of the Strike Committee to<br />\ndiscuss governance and the recruiting referendum.<br />\nThe Strike Committee presented new demands on Friday that asked the Administration<br />\nto: end classified research at APL by fiscal<br />\n1971, change the lab's priorities, set up a summer governance committee acceptable to the<br />\nstrikers and Local 1231 and begin negotiations<br />\non the weekend.<br />\nThe Strike Com.mittee's latest move came<br />\nafter growing dissatisfaction with the settlement<br />\nlast rhursday, and a feeling among many protesters that they had been tricked by Dean-elect<br />\nGeorge Benton.<br />\nThe Thursday agreement suspended military recruiting from campus, unless a referendum that may be held by May 1 shows that<br />\nstudents want recruiters back. And, according<br />\nto the strikers, the Administration agreed to<br />\ncontinue serious negotiations on other issues<br />\nlike governance and APL.<br />\nThe meetings of the protesters since the<br />\nsettlement have been marked by harsh attacks<br />\non the administration.<br />\nAt a Saturday meeting on the steps of<br />\nShriver Hall, Jim Keogh remarked, \"We didn't<br />\nunderstand how two-faced the .people we were<br />\ndealing with were.

Local<br />\n1231 came out for the strikers last Friday. The<br />\nStrike Committee also demands that the governance plan be presented to the entire university<br />\ncommunity for approval on a one-man, one-vote<br />\nbasis by Oct. 15, 1970.<br />\nIn addition, the strikers feel that some of<br />\nthe petitions which are circulating-are too broadly worded, and that if the referendum does take<br />\nplace, it should require a \"yes\" vote to return<br />\nmilitary recruiters.<br />\n-111111 limos<br />\n<br />\nMembers of the Strike Committee met Saturday near<br />\nShriver Hall to discuss strategy, and formulate positions<br />\nfor the Monday meeting wit:: George Benton.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n'APRIL 28, 1970<br />\n<br />\ncampus calendar<br />\nMechanics<br />\n*4:00 p.m. Dr. E.

The survey, conducted by Hopkins junior David<br />\nMayer, also showed that graduate students get the<br />\n<br />\nthy Baughn of the Hopkins Housing Bureau.<br />\nMayer's survey, which covers 90% of the apartments<br />\nrented to students on the 2500-3000 blocks of N. Calvert<br />\nand St. Paul streets, will be turned over to the Housing<br />\nBureau. It will enable students to find out what type of<br />\nlandlord they are renting from, and whether the rent they<br />\nare paying is too high.<br />\nAmong the landlords rated fair by thir tenants are<br />\nKarl Dod and Zimlin. Esquire Investment Co. and C. H.<br />\nHinegardner are among the major landlords rated fair<br />\nto good.<br />\nMayer found that the best landlords unfortunately tend<br />\nto be those with few properties in the area. People with<br />\nthe best apartments have the lowest ratio of students per<br />\ndwelling, as well as the lowest ratio of students per landlord.<br />\n<br />\nto lease it for a full year.<br />\nAs the housing situation becomes tighter in the Calvert<br />\n-St. Paul area, more Hopkins students are moving to other<br />\nparts of the city. Thosewho are willingto pay higher rents<br />\nand to sacrifice convenience are met with generally better quality. In northeast Baltimore, two realtors renting<br />\nto Hopkins students are Hamburger and Sullivan. They<br />\nrent an efficiency for about ninety dollars. For a semidetached or detached house the price jumps to almost<br />\nthree hundred/month.<br />\n<br />\nGrads More Responsible<br />\nLandlords feel that graduate students are more responsible than undergrads, theorized Mayer, and are therefore more willing to rent to them. Graduate students are<br />\nespecially predominant on St. Paul, which is generally<br />\nacknowledged to be more desirable than Calvert.<br />\nFor the students that worries that he is paying too much<br />\nrent, Mayer has computed the average rents for several<br />\nsizes of apartments in the area. The average price for a<br />\nsingle tenant is $83/month, for two, $113/month, for<br />\nthree, $99/month, and for four tenants, $85/month.<br />\nThe rent varies from block to block, however.The 2900<br />\nblocks on both N. Calvert and St. Paul streets were referred to by Mayer as a \"student ghetto.\" These blocks<br />\nhave the highest density of students and the highest rents as<br />\nwell. A double on this block of Calvert street may run as<br />\nhigh as $140/month. Half the apartments on this block were<br />\nrated poor-fair.<br />\n<br />\nmajority --of the best 'apartments in the area. In a rating<br />\nof the landlords in the area by their present tenants, three<br />\nof the major landlords that rent to students--Ohrensal<br />\n<br />\nand Williams, Suchting, and Anthony Dandy--were rated<br />\nonly poor to fair.<br />\nA future tenant's woes are further complicated by the<br />\nfact that no new housing is being built in the vicinity of<br />\nHopkins. \"Realtors have told me that this is the hottest<br />\nhousing market since World War II,\" stated Mrs. Doro-<br />\n<br />\nMayer pointed out that landlords charge virtually equal<br />\nrents for poor-fair apartments as they do for excellent<br />\napartments. He felt that landlords provide proper maintenance for their apartments until they run out capital.<br />\nSome apartments are never repaired. Most landlords, said<br />\nMayer, realize a 15% return on their investment.<br />\nMost of the apartments in the area are furnished, but<br />\nthis costs the student an average of $75/year in extra<br />\nrent. It is also about $40/year more expensive for the<br />\nstudent to lease an apartment for 10 months or less than<br />\n<br />\nIn the Bolton Hill area that is rapidly becoming popular<br />\nwith Hopkins students, F.G.Shrieber is renting efficiencies<br />\nfor $75/month, while W. H.C. Wilson is slightly more expensive. Generous, another realtor, has one and two bedroom flats ranging from ninety to a hundred dollars.<br />\nStudents trying to find housing in old residential areas<br />\nmay find themselves stymied by zoning laws. Such laws<br />\noften classify homes inhabited by a group of students as<br />\nboarding houses, thus making them illegal.<br />\n<br />\n(photos by lemm)<br />\n<br />\nPollution Panel Scores Government, Corporations<br />\nBy MARC KRIZACK<br />\nStudents, panelists and the<br />\ngeneral public lashed out at government and corporations during<br />\nthe<br />\nHopkins<br />\nEnvironmental<br />\nTeach-in on April 23.<br />\nMiss Margaret Pollard, a panelist and black yOuth director in<br />\nBaltimore, decried the destruction of homes Ly expressways,<br />\nand<br />\nthe lack of playgrounds,<br />\ndecent schools and adequate<br />\nhealth services in the Baltimore<br />\nghetto.<br />\nMiss Pollard placed blame on<br />\nthe government but added,\"Population density is one of the causes for the lack of every available type of public service.\" Miss<br />\nPollard also stated that the cities<br />\nwill be ruined unless there is an<br />\nI mmediate redistribution of global wealth.<br />\n<br />\nNixon's Man<br />\nAt one point in her address,<br />\nWhen referring to Dr. William<br />\nMcElroy, director of the National<br />\n<br />\nFoundation of Science, Miss Pollard was interrupted by a student:<br />\nwho shouted, \"Nixon's man for<br />\nNixon's America.\" Mr. McElroy<br />\nshrugged off the comment with<br />\nan amused laugh.<br />\nDr. Pierce Linaweaver, director of the Department of Public<br />\nWorks of Baltimore City, and a<br />\npanelist discussing the problems<br />\nof land and water use, was the<br />\ntarget of attacks over the planned<br />\nconstruction of a highway through<br />\none of the city's parks.

In the past year the<br />\nNixon Administration has blunted its<br />\nthrust, many blacks have rejected<br />\nintegration and white opposition has made<br />\nit politically risky.<br />\nSome of the chief<br />\nNews<br />\ntheoreticians of school<br />\nAnalysis desegregation work and<br />\nthink at Hopkins.<br />\nThe man who officially began it resides<br />\non the forth floor of Gilman amid strewn<br />\npapers and an oversized bronze bust. He<br />\nis Dr. James Coleman, a hulking and<br />\nnearly bald sociologist, author of the controversial Coleman Report.<br />\nCompleted in 1966, it framed the<br />\nanswer of minority pupil achievement in<br />\nterms of school integration. Coleman,the<br />\nstatistician, compiled literally hundreds<br />\nof figures to construct a diagram of an<br />\nintricate, self-sustainingweb of unequality.<br />\nNegro schools, he found, were inferior<br />\nto white schools in facilities, staff and<br />\nprograms which, when combined with a<br />\nless motivated student body, produced<br />\npoor black performance on achievement<br />\ntests. And the black child's performance<br />\nwould steadily worsen as he grew older.<br />\nColeman saw bussing to achieve integration as the only solution to this rat<br />\nrace.<br />\nSuch advice Lyndon Johnson formally,<br />\naccepted, and he pledged by 1970 to end<br />\nthe dual school systems in the South. Government attorneys were taking their seats<br />\nin Southern courtrooms and placing their<br />\nsupport on the side of desegregation.<br />\nThings have changed since then. Nixon<br />\nhas ended executive initiative in terminating Southern school segregation. No<br />\nlonger do the Federal Courts of Florida<br />\nor the Carolinas witness government<br />\nand civil rights lawyers working in<br />\nunison; now Washington often sits on the<br />\nside of the local school boards.<br />\n***<br />\nSegregated schools are legally separated into two categories vastly different<br />\nin their origins. De jure segregation<br />\ndenotes dual school systems that were<br />\narbitrarily devised by local government.<br />\nThe Supreme Court has called such systems unconstitutional. If the government<br />\nwas the founder of dual black and white<br />\nschools, the Court has declared, then<br />\nthe government must undo its actions.<br />\nOn the other hand, in the North lies<br />\nde facto segregation. These schools are<br />\npredominately black or Jewish or Protestant, not because of a government<br />\ndirective, but because social patterns<br />\n<br />\nhave caused such segregation to form.<br />\nThe Supreme Court has not ruled on<br />\nthis, although it has allowed local school<br />\nboards in the North to desegfegate voluntarily.<br />\n* * *<br />\n<br />\nNixon stated last month that he wants<br />\nto improve black schools instead of pushing for integration. According to Coleman's findings, such a decision is harmful.<br />\nLast Tuesday, speaking before the<br />\nSelect Committee on Equal Educational<br />\nOpportunities in Washington, Coleman<br />\ncommented, \"If schools are racially homogenous or economically homogenous,<br />\n<br />\nDr. John Walton of the Education Department: \"I would do some more experimentation instead ofjust bussing students around.\"<br />\nthe disadvantages a working class or Negro child experiences in his home<br />\nenvironment are multiplied by the disadvantages he experiences in his school<br />\nenvironment.\"<br />\nWith a higher peer group level, Coleman stated, a disadvantaged child can<br />\nfulfill his native potential better. He<br />\nreported to the Committee that students<br />\ntransferred from segregated to integrated schools have improved their grade<br />\naverage 20-25 per cent.<br />\nParadoxically, though, Coleman is<br />\nnow working with the Nixon Administration in HEW. He said that Nixon is neither<br />\npushing wholeheartedly toward or against<br />\nschool disegregation in an interview last<br />\nweek. \"Nixon's statement that he isn't<br />\ngoing to initiate a policy of bringing about<br />\nracial balance in segregated neighborhoods I think is unwise,\" Coleman noted,<br />\n\"but his idea to place $1,5 billion to implement school \u2022integration I think is<br />\ngreat.\"<br />\n<br />\nFacts, however, may prove otherwise.<br />\nNixon's $1.5 billion for \"racially-impacted schools\" is coming out of other<br />\ndomestic anti-poverty programs (the<br />\nTimes reported Sunday that it would probably come out of the Model Cities fund)<br />\ntherefore lessening the all-around effect<br />\nNixon's new program will make on the<br />\npoor.<br />\nOther education experts are also less<br />\nsure than Coleman that Nixon's school<br />\nexpenditures will prove worthwhile. \"It<br />\nall depends on how it's used,\" commented Dr. James McPartland of Social Relations. \"This money will go down the<br />\ndrain if it doesn't induce people to innovate new educational ideas.\" Dr. John<br />\nWalton of Education agreed. \"Let's get<br />\nthe money into the classroom, not other<br />\nactivities.\"<br />\nNixon has not specifically statedwhere<br />\nthe $1.5 billion will go. He indicated such<br />\nmoney will go to integrated summer<br />\ncamps, boarding schools and after-school<br />\nactivities.<br />\n**<br />\nSave the Neighborhood School has<br />\nbeen the cry of the Nixon Administration. It is a subtle delusion. 40 per cent<br />\nof all American pupils are now bused in<br />\nthis country at their school board's<br />\nexpense, not counting students who use<br />\npublic transportation to get to school.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Robert Crane of<br />\nSocial Relations, it is not the inconveniences of bussing that have caused<br />\nso much white opposition, it is that bussing is \"the code word for intentional integration.\"<br />\nCrane's work has shown that integrated schools cut the black dropout rate in<br />\nhalf, and that blacks who attended integrated schools are more likely to associate with whites 15 years later.<br />\nHowever, such numerical figures can<br />\nbe misleading. Crane's study is based<br />\non Negroes in segregated and integrated<br />\nschools in the late 1940's and 1950's.<br />\nDr. Walton noted that Crane had stereotyped blacks into one big, homogenous<br />\npot.<br />\n\"A black child who struggled in those<br />\ndays to get into a white school cannot be<br />\ncompared to an average ghetto student,\"<br />\nWalton asserted. \"That kid in the white<br />\nschool probably came from a highly motivated family and is more likely to do better anywhere.\"<br />\nWalton places the importance of integrating schools far below his colleagues. \"Bussing per se is not the<br />\nanswer. It is one solution and possibly<br />\nnot the most important one,\" Walton stated. \"I would do some more experimentation instead of just bussing students<br />\n<br />\naround.\"<br />\nThere are several plans on how to more<br />\ncreatively achieve integration. Pittsburg<br />\nhas developed an educational park for its<br />\nhigh<br />\nschool students. Several large<br />\nschools have recently been installed outside Pittsburg's city limits. Both black<br />\nand white students are bussed to the<br />\nschools.<br />\nAnother proposal calls for bussing students to another school only a few times<br />\nper week. Such a system, its advocates<br />\nclaim, would lessen the burden of daily<br />\nbussing and still facilitate integration.<br />\n***<br />\nWhere will it go from here? It's hard<br />\n<br />\nDr. James Coleman of the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment: \"Nixon's idea to place $1.5<br />\nbillion to impternent school integration I<br />\nthink is great.\"<br />\nlo say,replied Hopkins'experts, although<br />\nthey maintain a studied optimism. Coleman refuses to predict the outcome of the<br />\nNixon years. \"It (the administration)<br />\nmay be better than the previous one, it<br />\nmay be worse,\" he stated.<br />\nCrane rests the success of school desegregation in the court's hands.<br />\nthere was a Supreme Court decision that<br />\nschools had to be integrated in the North,<br />\nwithin 20-30 years it would be implemented.\" He predicted not that the ghetto<br />\nwill be gone, but that the lilly-white suburb will desegregate with time.<br />\nBut everything is up to conjecture. The<br />\nnext few months may well prove that<br />\nschool desegregation's progress has been<br />\nreversed. In the present political climate though integrationists will have<br />\nto do more than just wish to achieve their'<br />\ngoal.<br />\n<br />\nStudents and Administrators Clash on Governance Report<br />\nBy HARVEY LUKSENBURG<br />\nStudents and administrators disagreed<br />\non the recent report of the Howard Ad<br />\nHoc Committee on Governance.<br />\nThe report, released April 23,was the<br />\nresult of twelve weeks of work by a panel<br />\nof six faculty members appointed by the<br />\nGeneral Assembly. The report recommended the forming of two task forces,<br />\none dealing with the \"specific issues of<br />\ngovernance\" and another to be a \"blueribbon commission .on undergraduate<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nThe governance committee would be<br />\ncharged with providing more effective<br />\nmeans of communication, and representation for all students and nontenured<br />\nfaculty at all administrative levels.<br />\n<br />\nSame Old Story<br />\nYet, these changes w ill be made \"within the present institutional framework\",a<br />\nphrase that prompted many student leaders to reject the report. \"What this<br />\nmeans is that power will remain conc- ntrated in the hands of the people who<br />\nnow have it\", colnmented Christopher<br />\nOhly, a member of the SAC.\"Thingswill<br />\nremain as autocratical and tyrannical as<br />\nat present,\"<br />\nJohn Ferchak, of the Strike Govern-<br />\n<br />\nance Committee, said, \"What they say<br />\nis so obvious that it need not be belaboured. The fact that what is happening<br />\non campus negates their statement.\"<br />\nProfessor Woodford Howard, who<br />\nheaded the committee that issued the<br />\nreport maintained \"We had no illusions<br />\nthat we would please people. It's as good<br />\nas we could have done. It took a month<br />\njust to get students to talk to us.If we had<br />\nmore time, more money,and less antagonism, a better job could have been done.<br />\nThey spent two years on this problem at<br />\nPrinceton. I think that we did a reasonably good job of representing the opinion<br />\nof the majority of students.\"<br />\n<br />\nNew System<br />\n\"I am against the Howard Committee<br />\nreport, which will keep the present systern,\" said John Guess at a meeting of<br />\nGovernance Committee,<br />\nStrike<br />\nthe<br />\n\"There has to be something completely<br />\nnew.

The report is a step in the right<br />\n<br />\ndirection.

The Howard Committee report reaffirmed the Admin:stration's<br />\nfaith in maintaining some sort of continuity between old and new, rather than<br />\nstarting again from scratch.<br />\n<br />\nGordon: Strike Was Unnecessary<br />\nDr. Gordon asserted at a Friday press<br />\nconference that the student strike last<br />\nweek didn't affect his decision to suspend military recruiting. \"All the pressure was unnecessary,\" he said.<br />\nLast Thursday, after a week of protests and a two-day strike, the Administration agreed to ban military recruiters from campus, unless a referendum<br />\nheld by May 1 shows that students want<br />\nrecruiters back. A referendum will be<br />\nheld if at least 10% of the student body<br />\npetition for it.<br />\nIn a prepared statement, Dr. Gordon<br />\nexpressed pleasure at the possibility<br />\nof a recruiting referendum, and he supported Dean-elect George Benton's plan<br />\nfor a summer committee to create a new<br />\ngovernance system for the fall.<br />\n<br />\nAfter he read his statement in the<br />\nBoard Room in Shriver Hall, he faced<br />\nquestions from the Baltimore press and<br />\nnetworks.<br />\nGordon felt that he didn't lose to the<br />\nstrikers, as many members -)f the faculty and the Baltimore community have<br />\ncharged.\" Reason was the winner,\" he<br />\ndeclared.

As soon as the pressure is lifted, faculty<br />\nand administrators will simply and quite successfully turn<br />\ntheir backs.<br />\nFaculty and administrators are exploiting legitimate<br />\ndivisions within the student body\u2014most notably at the<br />\nmoment on the open campus issue of recruiting. Let the<br />\nreferendum settle the recruitment question. What we as<br />\nstudents must realize, however this issue is resolved, is<br />\nthat we have more pervading common interests which<br />\ndemand common action. The things this column has<br />\nspoken out on all year\u2014governance, and classified research.<br />\nIf we had had an adequate governance system, there would<br />\nhave been no need for a strike at all.<br />\nOn classified research, Lincoln Gordon once told us<br />\nthat he sees no reason Hopkins students should be concerned with APL. His reasoning: It's too far away. It's<br />\ntime Gordon finds out that students here are not quite<br />\nas parochial as all that.<br />\nWe call upon the administration to quit stalling on<br />\ngovernance and for students to put down their books\u2014<br />\nyes, only a week away from exams\u2014and not be fooled a<br />\nsecond time.<br />\n<br />\nEducation vs. Governance<br />\nThe Howard Committee on Governance had the good<br />\nsense to observe, \"The primary problem (at Hopkins) is<br />\nthe place and education of undergraduates in an institution<br />\noriented to training in research.\" But it made the mistake<br />\nof separating the issues of governance and education.<br />\nAll sorts of educational changes, from improved<br />\ncourse offerings to better teachers, are keyed to the amount of power students have. Yet the Howard group<br />\nhas given in to faculty demands for rigid control over our<br />\neducation: It created a separate committee, top-heavy<br />\nwith administrators and faculty, to study undergraduate<br />\n'education. Also, the education committee has no timelimit set on its investigation. As with other committees<br />\nat Hopkins, this one seems designed to delay change,<br />\nrather than promote it.<br />\nThe faculty has little respect for undergraduates, and<br />\neven less desire to improve our education. Only if they are<br />\nforced will they make significant changes. And the<br />\nbest way we can make sure that happens is if undergraduates are given a vital role in educational policy-making.<br />\nAny new governance plan must include a way in<br />\nwhich undergraduates can help shape their own education.<br />\nThe summer task force on governance must deal with<br />\neducational problems--and come up with a plan that gives<br />\nus real power. By trying to keep education and governance apart, the Howard Committee is trying to keep us<br />\npowerless.<br />\nTHE WIZARD OF ID<br />\n<br />\nt rkeld Entrrprises. ne., 190<br />\n<br />\nBy JOHN A. ADAMS<br />\nOut of somewhat muddled strategic thinking and<br />\nsmooth tactical maneuvering,a significant transfer<br />\nof power at Hopkins seems to have occurred.The<br />\nadvent of mass radicalism on the Homewood Campus has, however, left many people confused.<br />\nThere appears to be three major stresses emanating from last weeks actions-radical disagreement<br />\nwith the military underpinnings of our culture, a<br />\nrefusal to accept the current system of campus<br />\ngovernance and a slowly rising consciousness of<br />\nthe class nature of our society. All of this is<br />\nemphatically underscored by the newly-constituted willingness of the mass of students to seize<br />\npower when the old system becomes obstructionist.<br />\nI need only to make brief allusions to the military behemoth that major segments of our population is growing to dislike. The need for change<br />\nIs apparent, but the incentive to change is not selfgenerating within the system. One is left with<br />\ntwo alternatives-pick up the gun and destroy the<br />\nsystem or move to create political pressure which<br />\nwill force the system to make the radical changes<br />\nwhich are necessary.For the time being,the movement at Hopkins has chosen the latter, and I personally agree with that choice.<br />\nGiven that the current situation must be altered,<br />\nthe next step must be to ascertain the effectiveness<br />\nof various actions towards this end. First of all, if<br />\na nation is to be democratic, the actions of a particular geographic segment is not, in itself, going<br />\nto drastically alter policy. However, these units<br />\naggregated can command such power.<br />\n<br />\nRecruiters Symbolic<br />\nThis brings us to the recent moves to throw military recruiters off campus and the effects of<br />\nthis action. In one sense, it is true that the<br />\neffect on military manpower is non-existent.<br />\nHowever, campus recruitment is an important<br />\nsymbol.<br />\nCongressional action tying permission to recruit to appropriations for research and state-'<br />\nments of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff<br />\nabout the effect on the military when a university<br />\nthrows off recruiters attests to the symbolic importance of this action. Political power manipulations hinge largely on just such gestures. This<br />\nmeans of power transferral must not be underrated.<br />\nStudents, especially undergraduates, have for a<br />\nlong time felt as though they were second class<br />\ncitizens. They watch the quality of their education<br />\nslide while a cumbersome, powerless maze of<br />\ncommittees flagellates itself. They quickly learn<br />\nthat faculty members are promoted for their<br />\nresearch and that teaching success is virtually<br />\nignored. Only when students have power and the<br />\nadministration is relegated to its proper role of<br />\n<br />\nservant, to students and faculty, will the problems that beset Hopkins be successfully attacked. An ever increasing number of students, including some even from the ranks of the cynics,<br />\nare coming to that realization.<br />\nThe beginnings of a class consciousness is<br />\nevident in the demands of the strikers. A governance system to include workers, with all members of the community to be represented on a<br />\none man-one vote basis, is truly classless. In<br />\never growing numbers, students are shaking off<br />\nthe notion, inculcated in them by our society,<br />\nthat a man who works with his hands is inferior<br />\nand not capable of directing those actions which<br />\naffect him. Workers declared their solidarity with<br />\nstudents and a class division began to disappear.<br />\n<br />\nFaculty Assembly Denunciations<br />\nOn the other hand, the Faculty Assembly of Friday sharpened another division. Faculty denunciations of legal if \"extra-channel\" political moves<br />\nas \"terrorism\" and \"gangsterism,\" reveal the<br />\nreactionary sentiment of many members of the<br />\nfaculty. Allusions to feudal privileges,(\"My office<br />\nis my castle\") show their disdain for equality<br />\nfor all members within this community.<br />\nThe strike was a successful demonstration of<br />\nthe classic theory that if the governed take communal action, they can relieve the rulers of their<br />\npower. As with the entire human community, a<br />\nredefinition of morals is presently taking place.<br />\nOur heritage of laws to protect the rights of<br />\nproperty against human rights is being discarded<br />\nin favor of the rights of people to be protected<br />\nfrom those who have the power of property. People are dropping the legal definition of Johns Hopkins Incorporated in favor of Johns Hopkins...a<br />\nbody of scholars, both novice and experienced.<br />\nAs with all struggles between systems, the logic<br />\nof one may not be valid when applied to the other.<br />\nPeople committed to the old may find little sense<br />\nin the arguments of the new. That is when the<br />\nstruggle begins.<br />\n\"Radical\" denotes the amount of change<br />\nadvocated. \"Militant\" denotes the means for<br />\neffecting that change. While both are associated<br />\nwith violence, neither necessarily imply it.

Their<br />\nundying faith was rewarded with a last<br />\nsecond 9-8 victory.<br />\nCoach Bob Scott and his Jay stickers<br />\nhad done their homework thoroughly, in<br />\nbeing mentally and physically prepared for the clash with the Black Knights.<br />\nSparked by a four goal first quarter barrage and co-captain Doug Honig's game<br />\nwinning tally, the laxmen outlasted alive<br />\ngoal second half rally by the Cadets.<br />\nHonig lost the opening faceoff to Army's<br />\nSteve Wood, but this was only a momentary setback as the fired up Jays stormed back up field with sophomore attackman Paul Wallace opening the scoring<br />\nunassisted at 1:38. Twelve seconds later,<br />\nHopkins was given another psychological<br />\nboost with Bill Donovan, former West<br />\nPointer, taking the pass from Charlie<br />\nCoker and bouncing the ball past Army's<br />\ngoalie Rob Stewart for the Baltimore<br />\nclub's second score.<br />\n<br />\nCrowd Electrified<br />\nThe nearly 7000 Homewood Field crowd<br />\nand the players were electrified by the<br />\nease and quickness in which they penetrated the Point's defense. At 2:12 in the<br />\nfirst period Coker took a pass from Wallace to put Hopkins out in front 3-0. Although the Military Academy was to<br />\ncomeback and tie it up in the second<br />\nhalf, the stubborn Blue Jays were des-<br />\n<br />\ntined to never relinquish the lead.<br />\nSecond midfielder Eric Bergofsky<br />\nmissed getting Hopkins 4th goal by inches.<br />\nThe Jays fourth score finally came at<br />\n13:45 when super-sub Bill Barton, assisted by Honig, got his first of four goals.<br />\nBarton, a reserve attackman, replaced the injured Stu Kahl only moments before. Barton a junior hails from Baltimore and played his high school lacrosse,<br />\nat Towson. Kahl suffered stretched ligaments in his ankle after stepping in a<br />\nhole on the playing field. His status was<br />\nunknown at presstime.<br />\nBarton opened the second quarter with<br />\na well placed shot which hit the inside<br />\nof the post before carooming back into<br />\nplay. Hopkins lone second period score<br />\ncame at 10:45 with Barton scoring on a<br />\npass from Coker. The scoring,the calls,<br />\nand the groundballs all went against the<br />\nJays in this quarter. The individual<br />\nheroics of Army's all-American, Pete<br />\nCramblet, made the halftime score 5-2.<br />\nCramblet's first two goals came at 2:30<br />\nand 4:11 of this period. Before the final<br />\ngun he had 5 goals to his credit.<br />\n<br />\nDemonstrate Heroism<br />\nHopkins demonstrated some unique<br />\nheroism on its own part with Ken Dauses' sterling performance in the goal.<br />\nDauses' excellent display was marred<br />\nby only two muffed clears which did not,<br />\nat any rate, lead to Army scores. The<br />\nsecond half opened with Dauses stopping<br />\nboth Marty Knorr, and Cramblet, af<br />\npoint blank range.<br />\nEach team traded three goals in this<br />\nthird quarter. All three of Army's highly regarded attack figured in the scor,A<br />\n'iW<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Charlie Coker, (10), leaps high in the air to shake off Army's, Ed Hirsch. Hopkins<br />\nupset Army, 9-8, before a crowd of over 7000.<br />\n<br />\ning.<br />\n<br />\nTom Cafaro got Army's third goal,<br />\nwith Cramblet and Knorr adding the other<br />\ntwo.<br />\nSandwiched between two more Barton<br />\ngoals was Bill Donovan's second goal<br />\nof the afternoon. Bob Pfiefer was credited with the assists on Barton's goals,<br />\nand Wallace had his second assist on Donovan's score.<br />\n<br />\nCramblet Ties Score<br />\nHopkins three third period goals made<br />\nthe score 8-3 before Army started their<br />\nrally. In the final stanza Cramblet netted<br />\nhis team's 6th goal at 4:59. West Point<br />\nthen trailed by one at 6:36 after Ed Hirsches' score. Hirsch was the only midfielder to score for the Cadets.Cramblet<br />\n<br />\nat 9:06 tied the score at eight up.<br />\nBut then with Only 7 seconds remaining<br />\non the officials clock, Honig saved Hopkins the trouble of going into overtime.<br />\nWallace got his third assist on the winning<br />\ngoal. The five goals scored by Hopkins<br />\nattack marks the first time this year the<br />\nunit has outscored the midfields.<br />\nAfter Honig's winning marker the sky<br />\nwas flooded with those bright yellow<br />\n\"Beat Army\" balloons. The initial omen<br />\nhas been a good sign. Hopkins had returned to their home turf after a month<br />\nis absence, and to their winning ways<br />\nafter the Virginia sorespot. The stickers<br />\nhad hit the comeback trail with much<br />\nvengence, and now get primed for Saturday's game at Rutgers.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Vying for Lax Title<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' Doug Fuchs, (33), takes off after pickup loose ball. Blue Jay,<br />\nGary Handelman, and Pointers, Tom Cafaro and Bob Walker were also<br />\nin on the play.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAttackman, Paul Wallace (20), cuts around Army's Buck Walker (33).<br />\nWallace had the day's first tally and assisted on Honig's winning goal.<br />\n<br />\nAfter last Saturday's lacrosse<br />\nvictory against the powerful Cadets from West Point, there has<br />\nindeed been a great deal of excitement generated around the<br />\nHopkins Campus. Very few people including the die-hard fan,<br />\nas well as the expert,ever thought<br />\nthat Coach Bob Scott's Blue Jays<br />\nwould deliver as they did. However, those same people,who last<br />\nFebruary were even pessimistic<br />\nabout Hopkins chances of even<br />\nbreaking .500 ball, are now beginning to think more in terms<br />\nof an upset or two more.<br />\nFor such an amazing year thus<br />\nfar, credit is due to the entire<br />\nBlue Jay team and its coaching<br />\nstaff. The young, \"inexperienced\" Blue Jays, who were supposed to be concerned more with<br />\nrebuilding, than thinking about a<br />\nfourth<br />\nconsecutive<br />\nnational<br />\nchampionship, are flying high and<br />\nare out to prove the many skeptics wrong.<br />\nAnybody who picked Hopkins<br />\nto beat Armys Black Knights last<br />\nSaturday was considered needy<br />\nof professional help. Yet the<br />\nway in which our Blue Jays beat<br />\nthe Cadets could just be what<br />\nmay propel Hopkins pass Annapolis and Maryland.<br />\nHopkins has become a hardhitting ballclub this year, at least<br />\nmore so than in the past, and<br />\nthose fans who were at Homewood Field Saturday will attest<br />\nto that fact. The Blue Jays are<br />\nplaying a more rough and tumble<br />\ntype game, attributed in days<br />\npast only to West Point and Annapolis. Yet, if Hopkins, with<br />\nits ability to move the b..11, retains the physical and hitting<br />\n<br />\naspect so evident in Saturdays<br />\ngame, the up coming contests<br />\nwith the other lacrosse powers<br />\nwill be up for grabs.<br />\nHopkins rough play against<br />\nWest Point showed up in the final statistics, as the Blue Jays<br />\noutshot the Black Knights, 4726. A key to a win at Annapolis<br />\nagainst the Midshipmen lacrosse<br />\nteam is again perhaps how well<br />\nand how much the Blue Jays decide to hit and beat the Naval<br />\nAcademy at its own game. It<br />\nseems clear that if Hopkins can<br />\nhold its own in this department,<br />\nthey certainly will have a realistic shot at putting it to the<br />\nMidshipmen.<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jay team, after last<br />\nweek's big upset, certainly has<br />\nthe momentum going for them,<br />\nand they're out to prove that<br />\nthey've got a realistic shot at<br />\nthe national championship. Hopkins however cannot afford to<br />\nbecome complacent and rest on<br />\nthe Army upset. Navy and Maryland are far too strong, and the<br />\nBlue Jays certainly better be<br />\ngoing into those two games with<br />\n'the right attitude.<br />\nRutgers will be host to Bob<br />\nScott and his Blue Jays this<br />\nSaturday in an away game before the big games against Navy<br />\nand Maryland.<br />\n<br />\nBe Snug in Your Bug<br />\nIf you'd like to get around the high cost of living,<br />\nwe have a suggestion.<br />\nCut down on the high cost of getting around.<br />\nAnd buy a Volkswagen.

Benton met yesterday morning with<br />\n10 representatives of the Strike Committee to<br />\ndiscuss governance and the recruiting referendum.<br />\nThe Strike Committee presented new demands on Friday that asked the Administration<br />\nto: end classified research at APL by fiscal<br />\n1971, change the lab's priorities, set up a summer governance committee acceptable to the<br />\nstrikers and Local 1231 and begin negotiations<br />\non the weekend.<br />\nThe Strike Com.mittee's latest move came<br />\nafter growing dissatisfaction with the settlement<br />\nlast rhursday, and a feeling among many protesters that they had been tricked by Dean-elect<br />\nGeorge Benton.<br />\nThe Thursday agreement suspended military recruiting from campus, unless a referendum that may be held by May 1 shows that<br />\nstudents want recruiters back. And, according<br />\nto the strikers, the Administration agreed to<br />\ncontinue serious negotiations on other issues<br />\nlike governance and APL.<br />\nThe meetings of the protesters since the<br />\nsettlement have been marked by harsh attacks<br />\non the administration.<br />\nAt a Saturday meeting on the steps of<br />\nShriver Hall, Jim Keogh remarked, \"We didn't<br />\nunderstand how two-faced the .people we were<br />\ndealing with were.

The survey, conducted by Hopkins junior David<br />\nMayer, also showed that graduate students get the<br /><br />\nthy Baughn of the Hopkins Housing Bureau.<br />\nMayer's survey, which covers 90% of the apartments<br />\nrented to students on the 2500-3000 blocks of N. Calvert<br />\nand St. Paul streets, will be turned over to the Housing<br />\nBureau. It will enable students to find out what type of<br />\nlandlord they are renting from, and whether the rent they<br />\nare paying is too high.<br />\nAmong the landlords rated fair by thir tenants are<br />\nKarl Dod and Zimlin. Esquire Investment Co. and C. H.<br />\nHinegardner are among the major landlords rated fair<br />\nto good.<br />\nMayer found that the best landlords unfortunately tend<br />\nto be those with few properties in the area. People with<br />\nthe best apartments have the lowest ratio of students per<br />\ndwelling, as well as the lowest ratio of students per landlord.<br /><br />\nto lease it for a full year.<br />\nAs the housing situation becomes tighter in the Calvert<br />\n-St. Paul area, more Hopkins students are moving to other<br />\nparts of the city. Thosewho are willingto pay higher rents<br />\nand to sacrifice convenience are met with generally better quality. In northeast Baltimore, two realtors renting<br />\nto Hopkins students are Hamburger and Sullivan. They<br />\nrent an efficiency for about ninety dollars. For a semidetached or detached house the price jumps to almost<br />\nthree hundred/month.<br /><br />\nGrads More Responsible<br />\nLandlords feel that graduate students are more responsible than undergrads, theorized Mayer, and are therefore more willing to rent to them. Graduate students are<br />\nespecially predominant on St. Paul, which is generally<br />\nacknowledged to be more desirable than Calvert.<br />\nFor the students that worries that he is paying too much<br />\nrent, Mayer has computed the average rents for several<br />\nsizes of apartments in the area. The average price for a<br />\nsingle tenant is $83/month, for two, $113/month, for<br />\nthree, $99/month, and for four tenants, $85/month.<br />\nThe rent varies from block to block, however.The 2900<br />\nblocks on both N. Calvert and St. Paul streets were referred to by Mayer as a \"student ghetto.\" These blocks<br />\nhave the highest density of students and the highest rents as<br />\nwell. A double on this block of Calvert street may run as<br />\nhigh as $140/month. Half the apartments on this block were<br />\nrated poor-fair.<br /><br />\nmajority --of the best 'apartments in the area. In a rating<br />\nof the landlords in the area by their present tenants, three<br />\nof the major landlords that rent to students--Ohrensal<br /><br />\nand Williams, Suchting, and Anthony Dandy--were rated<br />\nonly poor to fair.<br />\nA future tenant's woes are further complicated by the<br />\nfact that no new housing is being built in the vicinity of<br />\nHopkins. \"Realtors have told me that this is the hottest<br />\nhousing market since World War II,\" stated Mrs. Doro-<br /><br />\nMayer pointed out that landlords charge virtually equal<br />\nrents for poor-fair apartments as they do for excellent<br />\napartments. He felt that landlords provide proper maintenance for their apartments until they run out capital.<br />\nSome apartments are never repaired. Most landlords, said<br />\nMayer, realize a 15% return on their investment.<br />\nMost of the apartments in the area are furnished, but<br />\nthis costs the student an average of $75/year in extra<br />\nrent. It is also about $40/year more expensive for the<br />\nstudent to lease an apartment for 10 months or less than<br /><br />\nIn the Bolton Hill area that is rapidly becoming popular<br />\nwith Hopkins students, F.G.Shrieber is renting efficiencies<br />\nfor $75/month, while W. H.C. Wilson is slightly more expensive. Generous, another realtor, has one and two bedroom flats ranging from ninety to a hundred dollars.<br />\nStudents trying to find housing in old residential areas<br />\nmay find themselves stymied by zoning laws. Such laws<br />\noften classify homes inhabited by a group of students as<br />\nboarding houses, thus making them illegal.<br /><br />\n(photos by lemm)<br /><br />\nPollution Panel Scores Government, Corporations<br />\nBy MARC KRIZACK<br />\nStudents, panelists and the<br />\ngeneral public lashed out at government and corporations during<br />\nthe<br />\nHopkins<br />\nEnvironmental<br />\nTeach-in on April 23.<br />\nMiss Margaret Pollard, a panelist and black yOuth director in<br />\nBaltimore, decried the destruction of homes Ly expressways,<br />\nand<br />\nthe lack of playgrounds,<br />\ndecent schools and adequate<br />\nhealth services in the Baltimore<br />\nghetto.<br />\nMiss Pollard placed blame on<br />\nthe government but added,\"Population density is one of the causes for the lack of every available type of public service.\" Miss<br />\nPollard also stated that the cities<br />\nwill be ruined unless there is an<br />\nI mmediate redistribution of global wealth.<br /><br />\nNixon's Man<br />\nAt one point in her address,<br />\nWhen referring to Dr. William<br />\nMcElroy, director of the National<br /><br />\nFoundation of Science, Miss Pollard was interrupted by a student:<br />\nwho shouted, \"Nixon's man for<br />\nNixon's America.\" Mr. McElroy<br />\nshrugged off the comment with<br />\nan amused laugh.<br />\nDr. Pierce Linaweaver, director of the Department of Public<br />\nWorks of Baltimore City, and a<br />\npanelist discussing the problems<br />\nof land and water use, was the<br />\ntarget of attacks over the planned<br />\nconstruction of a highway through<br />\none of the city's parks. As Dr.<br />\nLinaweaver attempted to justify<br />\nthe highway's construction, Len<br />\nSiger, a professor at the Community College of Baltimore,<br />\nwalked out.<br />\nDr. Gordon McDonald, a member of the President's 3-man<br />\nCouncil on Environment, was<br />\nquestioned about the government's plans to go ahead with<br />\nthe development of the Supersonic Transport while there are<br />\nother domestic needs which are<br />\nfar more pressing. Mr. McDon-<br /><br />\nald stated that development of the<br />\nSST would probably be halted.<br />\nSpeaking on the political and<br />\neconomic aspects of environmental protection along with McDonald, Mr. Andy Garling, national<br />\nEarth Day leader, called for corporate and government responsibility. Garling made note of the<br />\nsmall amount of money being<br />\nspent by industry for environmental cleanup and added, \"We<br />\nare looking for a total commitment--and industry has to take<br />\nthe lead.\"<br />\nGarling questioned whether<br />\nstate pollution control requirements are really adequate. In<br />\nconclusion, Garling noted,\" Pollution is not the problem, but it's<br />\na symptom of the problem.\"<br />\nState Senator and panelist<br />\nJulian Lapides remarked, \"Industry generaflv controls the<br />\nlegislature as I migLit add, _it<br />\nstill does.' \"HOVieve-r15', \u2014Sen.<br />\nLapides continued \"Public opin-:<br />\nion can-mean something.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Edward Radford, professor<br />\nof Environmental Medicine, concluded the Teach -inwhen he forecast the future of the ecology<br />\nmovement. \"In dealing with the<br />\nenvironment,\" said Radford,\"business and politics must go.\"<br /><br />\nHe added, \"We must convince<br />\nthe politicians that we have a<br />\nvoice and that we will stop technological changes if they are going to lead to a bad environment.\" The other panelists agreed.<br /><br />\n..sor<br />\nMembers of the Teach-In panel on the political aspects of pollution (1.-r.<br />\nDr. Edward Radford, Dr. Allen Brandt and Andy.Garling,<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nAPRIL 28, 1970<br /><br />\nIntegrationists' Dilemma: Where to go From Here<br />\nBy MARK REUTTER<br />\nSchool desegregation has reached<br />\ncritical midpoint. In the past year the<br />\nNixon Administration has blunted its<br />\nthrust, many blacks have rejected<br />\nintegration and white opposition has made<br />\nit politically risky.<br />\nSome of the chief<br />\nNews<br />\ntheoreticians of school<br />\nAnalysis desegregation work and<br />\nthink at Hopkins.<br />\nThe man who officially began it resides<br />\non the forth floor of Gilman amid strewn<br />\npapers and an oversized bronze bust. He<br />\nis Dr. James Coleman, a hulking and<br />\nnearly bald sociologist, author of the controversial Coleman Report.<br />\nCompleted in 1966, it framed the<br />\nanswer of minority pupil achievement in<br />\nterms of school integration. Coleman,the<br />\nstatistician, compiled literally hundreds<br />\nof figures to construct a diagram of an<br />\nintricate, self-sustainingweb of unequality.<br />\nNegro schools, he found, were inferior<br />\nto white schools in facilities, staff and<br />\nprograms which, when combined with a<br />\nless motivated student body, produced<br />\npoor black performance on achievement<br />\ntests. And the black child's performance<br />\nwould steadily worsen as he grew older.<br />\nColeman saw bussing to achieve integration as the only solution to this rat<br />\nrace.<br />\nSuch advice Lyndon Johnson formally,<br />\naccepted, and he pledged by 1970 to end<br />\nthe dual school systems in the South. Government attorneys were taking their seats<br />\nin Southern courtrooms and placing their<br />\nsupport on the side of desegregation.<br />\nThings have changed since then. Nixon<br />\nhas ended executive initiative in terminating Southern school segregation. No<br />\nlonger do the Federal Courts of Florida<br />\nor the Carolinas witness government<br />\nand civil rights lawyers working in<br />\nunison; now Washington often sits on the<br />\nside of the local school boards.<br />\n***<br />\nSegregated schools are legally separated into two categories vastly different<br />\nin their origins. De jure segregation<br />\ndenotes dual school systems that were<br />\narbitrarily devised by local government.<br />\nThe Supreme Court has called such systems unconstitutional. If the government<br />\nwas the founder of dual black and white<br />\nschools, the Court has declared, then<br />\nthe government must undo its actions.<br />\nOn the other hand, in the North lies<br />\nde facto segregation. These schools are<br />\npredominately black or Jewish or Protestant, not because of a government<br />\ndirective, but because social patterns<br /><br />\nhave caused such segregation to form.<br />\nThe Supreme Court has not ruled on<br />\nthis, although it has allowed local school<br />\nboards in the North to desegfegate voluntarily.<br />\n* * *<br /><br />\nNixon stated last month that he wants<br />\nto improve black schools instead of pushing for integration. According to Coleman's findings, such a decision is harmful.<br />\nLast Tuesday, speaking before the<br />\nSelect Committee on Equal Educational<br />\nOpportunities in Washington, Coleman<br />\ncommented, \"If schools are racially homogenous or economically homogenous,<br /><br />\nDr. John Walton of the Education Department: \"I would do some more experimentation instead ofjust bussing students around.\"<br />\nthe disadvantages a working class or Negro child experiences in his home<br />\nenvironment are multiplied by the disadvantages he experiences in his school<br />\nenvironment.\"<br />\nWith a higher peer group level, Coleman stated, a disadvantaged child can<br />\nfulfill his native potential better. He<br />\nreported to the Committee that students<br />\ntransferred from segregated to integrated schools have improved their grade<br />\naverage 20-25 per cent.<br />\nParadoxically, though, Coleman is<br />\nnow working with the Nixon Administration in HEW. He said that Nixon is neither<br />\npushing wholeheartedly toward or against<br />\nschool disegregation in an interview last<br />\nweek. \"Nixon's statement that he isn't<br />\ngoing to initiate a policy of bringing about<br />\nracial balance in segregated neighborhoods I think is unwise,\" Coleman noted,<br />\n\"but his idea to place $1,5 billion to implement school \u2022integration I think is<br />\ngreat.\"<br /><br />\nFacts, however, may prove otherwise.<br />\nNixon's $1.5 billion for \"racially-impacted schools\" is coming out of other<br />\ndomestic anti-poverty programs (the<br />\nTimes reported Sunday that it would probably come out of the Model Cities fund)<br />\ntherefore lessening the all-around effect<br />\nNixon's new program will make on the<br />\npoor.<br />\nOther education experts are also less<br />\nsure than Coleman that Nixon's school<br />\nexpenditures will prove worthwhile. \"It<br />\nall depends on how it's used,\" commented Dr. James McPartland of Social Relations. \"This money will go down the<br />\ndrain if it doesn't induce people to innovate new educational ideas.\" Dr. John<br />\nWalton of Education agreed. \"Let's get<br />\nthe money into the classroom, not other<br />\nactivities.\"<br />\nNixon has not specifically statedwhere<br />\nthe $1.5 billion will go. He indicated such<br />\nmoney will go to integrated summer<br />\ncamps, boarding schools and after-school<br />\nactivities.<br />\n**<br />\nSave the Neighborhood School has<br />\nbeen the cry of the Nixon Administration. It is a subtle delusion. 40 per cent<br />\nof all American pupils are now bused in<br />\nthis country at their school board's<br />\nexpense, not counting students who use<br />\npublic transportation to get to school.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Robert Crane of<br />\nSocial Relations, it is not the inconveniences of bussing that have caused<br />\nso much white opposition, it is that bussing is \"the code word for intentional integration.\"<br />\nCrane's work has shown that integrated schools cut the black dropout rate in<br />\nhalf, and that blacks who attended integrated schools are more likely to associate with whites 15 years later.<br />\nHowever, such numerical figures can<br />\nbe misleading. Crane's study is based<br />\non Negroes in segregated and integrated<br />\nschools in the late 1940's and 1950's.<br />\nDr. Walton noted that Crane had stereotyped blacks into one big, homogenous<br />\npot.<br />\n\"A black child who struggled in those<br />\ndays to get into a white school cannot be<br />\ncompared to an average ghetto student,\"<br />\nWalton asserted. \"That kid in the white<br />\nschool probably came from a highly motivated family and is more likely to do better anywhere.\"<br />\nWalton places the importance of integrating schools far below his colleagues. \"Bussing per se is not the<br />\nanswer. It is one solution and possibly<br />\nnot the most important one,\" Walton stated. \"I would do some more experimentation instead of just bussing students<br /><br />\naround.\"<br />\nThere are several plans on how to more<br />\ncreatively achieve integration. Pittsburg<br />\nhas developed an educational park for its<br />\nhigh<br />\nschool students. Several large<br />\nschools have recently been installed outside Pittsburg's city limits. Both black<br />\nand white students are bussed to the<br />\nschools.<br />\nAnother proposal calls for bussing students to another school only a few times<br />\nper week. Such a system, its advocates<br />\nclaim, would lessen the burden of daily<br />\nbussing and still facilitate integration.<br />\n***<br />\nWhere will it go from here? It's hard<br /><br />\nDr. James Coleman of the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment: \"Nixon's idea to place $1.5<br />\nbillion to impternent school integration I<br />\nthink is great.\"<br />\nlo say,replied Hopkins'experts, although<br />\nthey maintain a studied optimism. Coleman refuses to predict the outcome of the<br />\nNixon years. \"It (the administration)<br />\nmay be better than the previous one, it<br />\nmay be worse,\" he stated.<br />\nCrane rests the success of school desegregation in the court's hands.<br />\nthere was a Supreme Court decision that<br />\nschools had to be integrated in the North,<br />\nwithin 20-30 years it would be implemented.\" He predicted not that the ghetto<br />\nwill be gone, but that the lilly-white suburb will desegregate with time.<br />\nBut everything is up to conjecture. The<br />\nnext few months may well prove that<br />\nschool desegregation's progress has been<br />\nreversed. In the present political climate though integrationists will have<br />\nto do more than just wish to achieve their'<br />\ngoal.<br /><br />\nStudents and Administrators Clash on Governance Report<br />\nBy HARVEY LUKSENBURG<br />\nStudents and administrators disagreed<br />\non the recent report of the Howard Ad<br />\nHoc Committee on Governance.<br />\nThe report, released April 23,was the<br />\nresult of twelve weeks of work by a panel<br />\nof six faculty members appointed by the<br />\nGeneral Assembly. The report recommended the forming of two task forces,<br />\none dealing with the \"specific issues of<br />\ngovernance\" and another to be a \"blueribbon commission .on undergraduate<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nThe governance committee would be<br />\ncharged with providing more effective<br />\nmeans of communication, and representation for all students and nontenured<br />\nfaculty at all administrative levels.<br /><br />\nSame Old Story<br />\nYet, these changes w ill be made \"within the present institutional framework\",a<br />\nphrase that prompted many student leaders to reject the report. \"What this<br />\nmeans is that power will remain conc- ntrated in the hands of the people who<br />\nnow have it\", colnmented Christopher<br />\nOhly, a member of the SAC.\"Thingswill<br />\nremain as autocratical and tyrannical as<br />\nat present,\"<br />\nJohn Ferchak, of the Strike Govern-<br /><br />\nance Committee, said, \"What they say<br />\nis so obvious that it need not be belaboured. The fact that what is happening<br />\non campus negates their statement.\"<br />\nProfessor Woodford Howard, who<br />\nheaded the committee that issued the<br />\nreport maintained \"We had no illusions<br />\nthat we would please people. It's as good<br />\nas we could have done. It took a month<br />\njust to get students to talk to us.If we had<br />\nmore time, more money,and less antagonism, a better job could have been done.<br />\nThey spent two years on this problem at<br />\nPrinceton. I think that we did a reasonably good job of representing the opinion<br />\nof the majority of students.\"<br /><br />\nNew System<br />\n\"I am against the Howard Committee<br />\nreport, which will keep the present systern,\" said John Guess at a meeting of<br />\nGovernance Committee,<br />\nStrike<br />\nthe<br />\n\"There has to be something completely<br />\nnew. Committee members are very far<br />\nremoved from the problems. We need<br />\na system that will allow for intelligent<br />\ndecision-making.\"<br />\nDirector of Student Affairs Robert<br />\nBilgrave felt that it was a good report.<br />\n\"Undergraduates have felt like orphans<br />\nhere. The report is a step in the right<br /><br />\ndirection. The right ways of enforcing<br />\ngovernance are through channels.\"<br />\nThe basic conflict, then, is between<br />\nthose who wish to reform the status quo,<br />\nand those w1.\u00b0 are convinced that the<br />\nonly path to good governance lies in a<br />\ncomplete revision of present methods.<br />\nThe opposition is tired of the creation<br /><br />\nof these two new committees, while the<br />\nadministration places trust in their effectiveness. The Howard Committee report reaffirmed the Admin:stration's<br />\nfaith in maintaining some sort of continuity between old and new, rather than<br />\nstarting again from scratch.<br /><br />\nGordon: Strike Was Unnecessary<br />\nDr. Gordon asserted at a Friday press<br />\nconference that the student strike last<br />\nweek didn't affect his decision to suspend military recruiting. \"All the pressure was unnecessary,\" he said.<br />\nLast Thursday, after a week of protests and a two-day strike, the Administration agreed to ban military recruiters from campus, unless a referendum<br />\nheld by May 1 shows that students want<br />\nrecruiters back. A referendum will be<br />\nheld if at least 10% of the student body<br />\npetition for it.<br />\nIn a prepared statement, Dr. Gordon<br />\nexpressed pleasure at the possibility<br />\nof a recruiting referendum, and he supported Dean-elect George Benton's plan<br />\nfor a summer committee to create a new<br />\ngovernance system for the fall.<br /><br />\nAfter he read his statement in the<br />\nBoard Room in Shriver Hall, he faced<br />\nquestions from the Baltimore press and<br />\nnetworks.<br />\nGordon felt that he didn't lose to the<br />\nstrikers, as many members -)f the faculty and the Baltimore community have<br />\ncharged.\" Reason was the winner,\" he<br />\ndeclared.

As soon as the pressure is lifted, faculty<br />\nand administrators will simply and quite successfully turn<br />\ntheir backs.<br />\nFaculty and administrators are exploiting legitimate<br />\ndivisions within the student body\u2014most notably at the<br />\nmoment on the open campus issue of recruiting. Let the<br />\nreferendum settle the recruitment question. What we as<br />\nstudents must realize, however this issue is resolved, is<br />\nthat we have more pervading common interests which<br />\ndemand common action. The things this column has<br />\nspoken out on all year\u2014governance, and classified research.<br />\nIf we had had an adequate governance system, there would<br />\nhave been no need for a strike at all.<br />\nOn classified research, Lincoln Gordon once told us<br />\nthat he sees no reason Hopkins students should be concerned with APL. His reasoning: It's too far away. It's<br />\ntime Gordon finds out that students here are not quite<br />\nas parochial as all that.<br />\nWe call upon the administration to quit stalling on<br />\ngovernance and for students to put down their books\u2014<br />\nyes, only a week away from exams\u2014and not be fooled a<br />\nsecond time.<br /><br />\nEducation vs. Governance<br />\nThe Howard Committee on Governance had the good<br />\nsense to observe, \"The primary problem (at Hopkins) is<br />\nthe place and education of undergraduates in an institution<br />\noriented to training in research.\" But it made the mistake<br />\nof separating the issues of governance and education.<br />\nAll sorts of educational changes, from improved<br />\ncourse offerings to better teachers, are keyed to the amount of power students have. Yet the Howard group<br />\nhas given in to faculty demands for rigid control over our<br />\neducation: It created a separate committee, top-heavy<br />\nwith administrators and faculty, to study undergraduate<br />\n'education. Also, the education committee has no timelimit set on its investigation. As with other committees<br />\nat Hopkins, this one seems designed to delay change,<br />\nrather than promote it.<br />\nThe faculty has little respect for undergraduates, and<br />\neven less desire to improve our education. Only if they are<br />\nforced will they make significant changes. And the<br />\nbest way we can make sure that happens is if undergraduates are given a vital role in educational policy-making.<br />\nAny new governance plan must include a way in<br />\nwhich undergraduates can help shape their own education.<br />\nThe summer task force on governance must deal with<br />\neducational problems--and come up with a plan that gives<br />\nus real power. By trying to keep education and governance apart, the Howard Committee is trying to keep us<br />\npowerless.<br />\nTHE WIZARD OF ID<br /><br />\nt rkeld Entrrprises. ne., 190<br /><br />\nBy JOHN A. ADAMS<br />\nOut of somewhat muddled strategic thinking and<br />\nsmooth tactical maneuvering,a significant transfer<br />\nof power at Hopkins seems to have occurred.The<br />\nadvent of mass radicalism on the Homewood Campus has, however, left many people confused.<br />\nThere appears to be three major stresses emanating from last weeks actions-radical disagreement<br />\nwith the military underpinnings of our culture, a<br />\nrefusal to accept the current system of campus<br />\ngovernance and a slowly rising consciousness of<br />\nthe class nature of our society. All of this is<br />\nemphatically underscored by the newly-constituted willingness of the mass of students to seize<br />\npower when the old system becomes obstructionist.<br />\nI need only to make brief allusions to the military behemoth that major segments of our population is growing to dislike. The need for change<br />\nIs apparent, but the incentive to change is not selfgenerating within the system. One is left with<br />\ntwo alternatives-pick up the gun and destroy the<br />\nsystem or move to create political pressure which<br />\nwill force the system to make the radical changes<br />\nwhich are necessary.For the time being,the movement at Hopkins has chosen the latter, and I personally agree with that choice.<br />\nGiven that the current situation must be altered,<br />\nthe next step must be to ascertain the effectiveness<br />\nof various actions towards this end. First of all, if<br />\na nation is to be democratic, the actions of a particular geographic segment is not, in itself, going<br />\nto drastically alter policy. However, these units<br />\naggregated can command such power.<br /><br />\nRecruiters Symbolic<br />\nThis brings us to the recent moves to throw military recruiters off campus and the effects of<br />\nthis action. In one sense, it is true that the<br />\neffect on military manpower is non-existent.<br />\nHowever, campus recruitment is an important<br />\nsymbol.<br />\nCongressional action tying permission to recruit to appropriations for research and state-'<br />\nments of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff<br />\nabout the effect on the military when a university<br />\nthrows off recruiters attests to the symbolic importance of this action. Political power manipulations hinge largely on just such gestures. This<br />\nmeans of power transferral must not be underrated.<br />\nStudents, especially undergraduates, have for a<br />\nlong time felt as though they were second class<br />\ncitizens. They watch the quality of their education<br />\nslide while a cumbersome, powerless maze of<br />\ncommittees flagellates itself. They quickly learn<br />\nthat faculty members are promoted for their<br />\nresearch and that teaching success is virtually<br />\nignored. Only when students have power and the<br />\nadministration is relegated to its proper role of<br /><br />\nservant, to students and faculty, will the problems that beset Hopkins be successfully attacked. An ever increasing number of students, including some even from the ranks of the cynics,<br />\nare coming to that realization.<br />\nThe beginnings of a class consciousness is<br />\nevident in the demands of the strikers. A governance system to include workers, with all members of the community to be represented on a<br />\none man-one vote basis, is truly classless. In<br />\never growing numbers, students are shaking off<br />\nthe notion, inculcated in them by our society,<br />\nthat a man who works with his hands is inferior<br />\nand not capable of directing those actions which<br />\naffect him. Workers declared their solidarity with<br />\nstudents and a class division began to disappear.<br /><br />\nFaculty Assembly Denunciations<br />\nOn the other hand, the Faculty Assembly of Friday sharpened another division. Faculty denunciations of legal if \"extra-channel\" political moves<br />\nas \"terrorism\" and \"gangsterism,\" reveal the<br />\nreactionary sentiment of many members of the<br />\nfaculty. Allusions to feudal privileges,(\"My office<br />\nis my castle\") show their disdain for equality<br />\nfor all members within this community.<br />\nThe strike was a successful demonstration of<br />\nthe classic theory that if the governed take communal action, they can relieve the rulers of their<br />\npower. As with the entire human community, a<br />\nredefinition of morals is presently taking place.<br />\nOur heritage of laws to protect the rights of<br />\nproperty against human rights is being discarded<br />\nin favor of the rights of people to be protected<br />\nfrom those who have the power of property. People are dropping the legal definition of Johns Hopkins Incorporated in favor of Johns Hopkins...a<br />\nbody of scholars, both novice and experienced.<br />\nAs with all struggles between systems, the logic<br />\nof one may not be valid when applied to the other.<br />\nPeople committed to the old may find little sense<br />\nin the arguments of the new. That is when the<br />\nstruggle begins.<br />\n\"Radical\" denotes the amount of change<br />\nadvocated. \"Militant\" denotes the means for<br />\neffecting that change. While both are associated<br />\nwith violence, neither necessarily imply it. The<br />\nmovement at Hopkins restrained its violent urges<br />\nand the administration chose to yield to the forces of change before violence had to be resorted<br />\nto. Let us all hope that this is a precedent which<br />\nwill not be broken.<br />\n_<br />\nJohn A.

Twelve seconds later,<br />\nHopkins was given another psychological<br />\nboost with Bill Donovan, former West<br />\nPointer, taking the pass from Charlie<br />\nCoker and bouncing the ball past Army's<br />\ngoalie Rob Stewart for the Baltimore<br />\nclub's second score.<br /><br />\nCrowd Electrified<br />\nThe nearly 7000 Homewood Field crowd<br />\nand the players were electrified by the<br />\nease and quickness in which they penetrated the Point's defense. At 2:12 in the<br />\nfirst period Coker took a pass from Wallace to put Hopkins out in front 3-0. Although the Military Academy was to<br />\ncomeback and tie it up in the second<br />\nhalf, the stubborn Blue Jays were des-<br /><br />\ntined to never relinquish the lead.<br />\nSecond midfielder Eric Bergofsky<br />\nmissed getting Hopkins 4th goal by inches.<br />\nThe Jays fourth score finally came at<br />\n13:45 when super-sub Bill Barton, assisted by Honig, got his first of four goals.<br />\nBarton, a reserve attackman, replaced the injured Stu Kahl only moments before. Barton a junior hails from Baltimore and played his high school lacrosse,<br />\nat Towson. Kahl suffered stretched ligaments in his ankle after stepping in a<br />\nhole on the playing field. His status was<br />\nunknown at presstime.<br />\nBarton opened the second quarter with<br />\na well placed shot which hit the inside<br />\nof the post before carooming back into<br />\nplay. Hopkins lone second period score<br />\ncame at 10:45 with Barton scoring on a<br />\npass from Coker. The scoring,the calls,<br />\nand the groundballs all went against the<br />\nJays in this quarter. The individual<br />\nheroics of Army's all-American, Pete<br />\nCramblet, made the halftime score 5-2.<br />\nCramblet's first two goals came at 2:30<br />\nand 4:11 of this period. Before the final<br />\ngun he had 5 goals to his credit.<br /><br />\nDemonstrate Heroism<br />\nHopkins demonstrated some unique<br />\nheroism on its own part with Ken Dauses' sterling performance in the goal.<br />\nDauses' excellent display was marred<br />\nby only two muffed clears which did not,<br />\nat any rate, lead to Army scores. The<br />\nsecond half opened with Dauses stopping<br />\nboth Marty Knorr, and Cramblet, af<br />\npoint blank range.<br />\nEach team traded three goals in this<br />\nthird quarter.

In the final stanza Cramblet netted<br />\nhis team's 6th goal at 4:59. West Point<br />\nthen trailed by one at 6:36 after Ed Hirsches' score. Hirsch was the only midfielder to score for the Cadets.Cramblet<br /><br />\nat 9:06 tied the score at eight up.<br />\nBut then with Only 7 seconds remaining<br />\non the officials clock, Honig saved Hopkins the trouble of going into overtime.<br />\nWallace got his third assist on the winning<br />\ngoal. The five goals scored by Hopkins<br />\nattack marks the first time this year the<br />\nunit has outscored the midfields.<br />\nAfter Honig's winning marker the sky<br />\nwas flooded with those bright yellow<br />\n\"Beat Army\" balloons. The initial omen<br />\nhas been a good sign. Hopkins had returned to their home turf after a month<br />\nis absence, and to their winning ways<br />\nafter the Virginia sorespot.

Very few people including the die-hard fan,<br />\nas well as the expert,ever thought<br />\nthat Coach Bob Scott's Blue Jays<br />\nwould deliver as they did. However, those same people,who last<br />\nFebruary were even pessimistic<br />\nabout Hopkins chances of even<br />\nbreaking .500 ball, are now beginning to think more in terms<br />\nof an upset or two more.<br />\nFor such an amazing year thus<br />\nfar, credit is due to the entire<br />\nBlue Jay team and its coaching<br />\nstaff. The young, \"inexperienced\" Blue Jays, who were supposed to be concerned more with<br />\nrebuilding, than thinking about a<br />\nfourth<br />\nconsecutive<br />\nnational<br />\nchampionship, are flying high and<br />\nare out to prove the many skeptics wrong.<br />\nAnybody who picked Hopkins<br />\nto beat Armys Black Knights last<br />\nSaturday was considered needy<br />\nof professional help. Yet the<br />\nway in which our Blue Jays beat<br />\nthe Cadets could just be what<br />\nmay propel Hopkins pass Annapolis and Maryland.<br />\nHopkins has become a hardhitting ballclub this year, at least<br />\nmore so than in the past, and<br />\nthose fans who were at Homewood Field Saturday will attest<br />\nto that fact. The Blue Jays are<br />\nplaying a more rough and tumble<br />\ntype game, attributed in days<br />\npast only to West Point and Annapolis. Yet, if Hopkins, with<br />\nits ability to move the b..11, retains the physical and hitting<br /><br />\naspect so evident in Saturdays<br />\ngame, the up coming contests<br />\nwith the other lacrosse powers<br />\nwill be up for grabs.<br />\nHopkins rough play against<br />\nWest Point showed up in the final statistics, as the Blue Jays<br />\noutshot the Black Knights, 4726. A key to a win at Annapolis<br />\nagainst the Midshipmen lacrosse<br />\nteam is again perhaps how well<br />\nand how much the Blue Jays decide to hit and beat the Naval<br />\nAcademy at its own game. It<br />\nseems clear that if Hopkins can<br />\nhold its own in this department,<br />\nthey certainly will have a realistic shot at putting it to the<br />\nMidshipmen.<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jay team, after last<br />\nweek's big upset, certainly has<br />\nthe momentum going for them,<br />\nand they're out to prove that<br />\nthey've got a realistic shot at<br />\nthe national championship. Hopkins however cannot afford to<br />\nbecome complacent and rest on<br />\nthe Army upset. Navy and Maryland are far too strong, and the<br />\nBlue Jays certainly better be<br />\ngoing into those two games with<br />\n'the right attitude.<br />\nRutgers will be host to Bob<br />\nScott and his Blue Jays this<br />\nSaturday in an away game before the big games against Navy<br />\nand Maryland.<br /><br />\nBe Snug in Your Bug<br />\nIf you'd like to get around the high cost of living,<br />\nwe have a suggestion.<br />\nCut down on the high cost of getting around.<br />\nAnd buy a Volkswagen.
