Attendance at the University during the college<br />\nyear is the college man's business; but during the vacation he can help<br />\ndirectly, he can render real service. Now is the time to decide how<br />\nyou will help. Don't wait until after examinations, when circumstances may make it too late to use you. If you want to help, find out<br />\nwhere you can do some good; don't spend the summer patriotically<br />\nby making flags and service buttons! The Government departments<br />\nneed clerical workers and stenographers all the time. The farmers<br />\nare begging for agricultural workers, for every one they can get. The<br />\nDepartment of Labor, through its Employment Bureau, can place an<br />\nunlimited number of mechanics, skilled machinists, engineering students. The Emergency Fleet Corporation have let us know how<br />\neagerly they desire more men, that there is room in the shipyards<br />\nfor every college man.

It is distinctly<br />\nunwise to remain in that area,<br />\nand you hustle over it in record<br />\ntime.) One day I was riding<br />\ndown a camouflaged road quite<br />\nnear the front when a shell lit<br />\nabout 30 yards behind my horse.<br />\nI didult walk him much until I<br />\ngot to a safer neighborhood. Another time the deserted village<br />\nin which we were located was<br />\nbombarded. I thought all ray<br />\n--clothes and other stuff which we<br />\ncarry (and which is mighty hard<br />\nto replace over here) was going<br />\nup in small fragments. But on<br />\ngoing to my billet immediately<br />\nafter the shelling, I found that<br />\na house quite near had been struck<br />\nbut mine was all right. I didn't<br />\ntake long to move, however, not<br />\nknowing when the whiz-bangs<br />\nwould begin again. Just a few<br />\ndays before that we were aroused<br />\nat 5 A.

They surely<br />\nwere attractive fellows\u2014very interesting about their experiences<br />\nearlier in the war and at Verdun,<br />\nand most willing to help us. It<br />\nwas an excellent opportunity to<br />\nlearn French and I thought it a<br />\ncontradiction to those who accuse<br />\nus of provincialism that five or<br />\nsix of us could speak fairly intelligible French while very few of<br />\nthe French Officers could speak<br />\nEnglish. When we left the sector<br />\nthey were very complimentary<br />\nabout the courage and coolness<br />\nof our men under fire and said<br />\n\u2022 contact with our troops had done<br />\nmuch to improve the morale of<br />\ntheir men.<br />\nWe had good fun marching for<br />\nthree or four days\u2014the country<br />\nis beautiful as you may know<br />\nfrom personal experience.
