Of course, we cannot agree with the Dean that English writing and journalism are one and the same.<br />\nIf they were, the joke would be on Columbia and several other universities which<br />\nhave spent large amounts of money on journalism departments.<br />\nPi Delt has made the first step toward<br />\naccomplishing its goal. In the institution of<br />\nthe informal lectures it has the instrument<br />\nwith which to knock away the supports of<br />\nthe Dean's arguments against the course.<br />\nThe next step after creating the instrument,<br />\nis to utilize it to its fullest extent. Herein<br />\nlies the crux of the whole matter. Will Pi<br />\nD. E. be able to get sufficient support from<br />\nthe student body? If only a few students<br />\nattend the lectures, the Dean will be justified in saying that he does not feel the need<br />\nfor a regular course. But if Pi D. E. can<br />\narouse enough interest and get a presentable gathering together, the Dean will realize that there is a desire for the course and<br />\nwill no doubt act accordingly.<br />\nTherefore it becomes evident that the<br />\nmatter is in the hands of the students. They<br />\nalone will decide the issue. If they want a<br />\njournalism course, they can get it. Pi Delt<br />\nhas provided the means. It is up to the students to utilize it.<br />\n<br />\nJoin Our Frat<br />\nYesterday the rushing season opened<br />\namong the fraternities on the interfraternity<br />\nboard.

We are<br />\ngoing to do our best to make this<br />\npossible; but, even if we can't, we<br />\nfeel that the other two features of<br />\nthe course make it well worth while.<br />\nOur second purpose is to provide<br />\nyou with enough skill in sports to<br />\nOf<br />\nmake you really enjoy them.<br />\ncourse, we don't expect to make all<br />\nyou boys All-Americans; but, at<br />\nleast we can make you familiar with<br />\nthe fundamentals of several sports.<br />\nI can tell you that it's a feeling of<br />\nreal satisfaction to be able to throw<br />\na football, or hit a baseball better<br />\nthan the next fellow.<br />\nPlan Hobby Education<br />\n\"Perhaps a little explanation of<br />\nour last aim is necessary. We can<br />\nbroadly define it as education to a<br />\nthol3by.\" Most of us are fairly active<br />\nup until the end of our college careers. Most of our attention, however, is paid to football, lacrosse and<br />\nother team sports rather than to<br />\nsuch individual games as we are going to play here. After college opportunities to continue in these more<br />\nstrenuous sports are given almost<br />\nsolely to the expert player. Any<br />\nbody which is accustomed to exercise, however, cannot function properly without some outlet for its enGames, like handball, inergies.<br />\nexpensive and easy to play, are the<br />\nideal solution to such a problem.<br />\nThus, this course is designed for future as well as present needs.\"<br />\n<br />\nK&E<br />\n<br />\ntraining<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\ncheer<br />\n<br />\nThe object is to bring out all possible enthusiasm at games by having an organized squad of five cheer<br />\nleaders directing the exuberance. In<br />\nthe past, cheer leading has been<br />\nlargely a matter of individual initiative. The difficulty has been that<br />\nthere have been few individuals and<br />\nlittle initiative.<br />\nAn an added incentive to a more<br />\npotent display of spirit, it is reported<br />\nthat Dr. Clifford Lyons' class in<br />\npublic speaking will be assigned the<br />\ntask of composing new yells. It is<br />\nbelieved that in the course of their<br />\nstudies concerning the effects of various sounds, these men will become<br />\nmore or less capable of formulating<br />\ncollege cheers.<br />\nSome of them, it is thought, may<br />\neven be good enough to be used.<br />\nBaer then turned his attention to<br />\nmore concrete matters in outlining<br />\nthe course for the coming fall. \"During the first week,\" he said, \"the class<br />\nwill devote its attention to random<br />\nplay. Next will come athletic aptitude tests. Separate groups, graded<br />\nby degrees of skill, will then be<br />\nthroughout<br />\nformed. Improvement<br />\nthe year will be the basis for a passing mark.\"<br />\nAttendance will also play a large<br />\npart. \"If,\" said Baer, in speaking of<br />\nthis, \"you miss two gym periods a<br />\nsemester, you place yourself in a<br />\nprecarious position.\"<br />\nPhysical training sections are held<br />\nevery morning from Monday to Friday, from nine-thirty to eleven-thirty, from one to three on Tuesdays<br />\nand Thursdays, and from two to four<br />\non Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

Of course, we cannot agree with the Dean that English writing and journalism are one and the same.<br />\nIf they were, the joke would be on Columbia and several other universities which<br />\nhave spent large amounts of money on journalism departments.<br />\nPi Delt has made the first step toward<br />\naccomplishing its goal. In the institution of<br />\nthe informal lectures it has the instrument<br />\nwith which to knock away the supports of<br />\nthe Dean's arguments against the course.<br />\nThe next step after creating the instrument,<br />\nis to utilize it to its fullest extent. Herein<br />\nlies the crux of the whole matter. Will Pi<br />\nD. E. be able to get sufficient support from<br />\nthe student body? If only a few students<br />\nattend the lectures, the Dean will be justified in saying that he does not feel the need<br />\nfor a regular course. But if Pi D. E. can<br />\narouse enough interest and get a presentable gathering together, the Dean will realize that there is a desire for the course and<br />\nwill no doubt act accordingly.<br />\nTherefore it becomes evident that the<br />\nmatter is in the hands of the students. They<br />\nalone will decide the issue. If they want a<br />\njournalism course, they can get it. Pi Delt<br />\nhas provided the means. It is up to the students to utilize it.<br /><br />\nJoin Our Frat<br />\nYesterday the rushing season opened<br />\namong the fraternities on the interfraternity<br />\nboard.

We are<br />\ngoing to do our best to make this<br />\npossible; but, even if we can't, we<br />\nfeel that the other two features of<br />\nthe course make it well worth while.<br />\nOur second purpose is to provide<br />\nyou with enough skill in sports to<br />\nOf<br />\nmake you really enjoy them.<br />\ncourse, we don't expect to make all<br />\nyou boys All-Americans; but, at<br />\nleast we can make you familiar with<br />\nthe fundamentals of several sports.<br />\nI can tell you that it's a feeling of<br />\nreal satisfaction to be able to throw<br />\na football, or hit a baseball better<br />\nthan the next fellow.<br />\nPlan Hobby Education<br />\n\"Perhaps a little explanation of<br />\nour last aim is necessary. We can<br />\nbroadly define it as education to a<br />\nthol3by.\" Most of us are fairly active<br />\nup until the end of our college careers. Most of our attention, however, is paid to football, lacrosse and<br />\nother team sports rather than to<br />\nsuch individual games as we are going to play here. After college opportunities to continue in these more<br />\nstrenuous sports are given almost<br />\nsolely to the expert player. Any<br />\nbody which is accustomed to exercise, however, cannot function properly without some outlet for its enGames, like handball, inergies.<br />\nexpensive and easy to play, are the<br />\nideal solution to such a problem.<br />\nThus, this course is designed for future as well as present needs.\"<br /><br />\nK&amp;E<br /><br />\ntraining<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\ncheer<br /><br />\nThe object is to bring out all possible enthusiasm at games by having an organized squad of five cheer<br />\nleaders directing the exuberance. In<br />\nthe past, cheer leading has been<br />\nlargely a matter of individual initiative. The difficulty has been that<br />\nthere have been few individuals and<br />\nlittle initiative.<br />\nAn an added incentive to a more<br />\npotent display of spirit, it is reported<br />\nthat Dr. Clifford Lyons' class in<br />\npublic speaking will be assigned the<br />\ntask of composing new yells. It is<br />\nbelieved that in the course of their<br />\nstudies concerning the effects of various sounds, these men will become<br />\nmore or less capable of formulating<br />\ncollege cheers.<br />\nSome of them, it is thought, may<br />\neven be good enough to be used.<br />\nBaer then turned his attention to<br />\nmore concrete matters in outlining<br />\nthe course for the coming fall. \"During the first week,\" he said, \"the class<br />\nwill devote its attention to random<br />\nplay. Next will come athletic aptitude tests. Separate groups, graded<br />\nby degrees of skill, will then be<br />\nthroughout<br />\nformed. Improvement<br />\nthe year will be the basis for a passing mark.\"<br />\nAttendance will also play a large<br />\npart. \"If,\" said Baer, in speaking of<br />\nthis, \"you miss two gym periods a<br />\nsemester, you place yourself in a<br />\nprecarious position.\"<br />\nPhysical training sections are held<br />\nevery morning from Monday to Friday, from nine-thirty to eleven-thirty, from one to three on Tuesdays<br />\nand Thursdays, and from two to four<br />\non Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
