Anderson, a spokesman for<br />\nEducation Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos,<br />\nsaid no specific complaints of discrimination had been filed against the institutions.<br />\nBut he said concern had been expressed by<br />\nlawmakers, parents, and students about admissions policies at the two universities,<br />\n\"We're not going into this saying Haryard is discriminating and U.C.L.A. is<br />\ndiscriminating,\" said Mr. Anderson. \"But<br />\nthere have been public allegations made<br />\nthat there may be a quota system limiting<br />\nAsians, and we have got to go out there<br />\nand check on the health of the system.\"<br />\n\"We Absolutely Do Not Discriminate\"<br />\nOfficials at both Harvard and U.C.L.A.<br />\nvehemently denied that their institutions<br />\nhad used quotas to restrict Asian students.<br />\n\"We absolutely do not discriminate and<br />\ndo not have quotas set against Asian<br />\nAmericans or any other group,\" said Susie<br />\nChao, an admissions officer at Harvard<br />\nUniversity. \"We'd like to bring in the<br />\nmost talented students, and to limit<br />\nourselves in any way\u2014besides being<br />\n<br />\nillegal\u2014 would be detrimental in the long<br />\nrun.\"<br />\nMs. Chao said the proportion of students<br />\nat Harvard who are Asian Americans has<br />\nnearly tripled in the last 10 years. In<br />\nacademic 1978-79, she said, 5 percent of<br />\nthe freshmen at Harvard were Asians. This<br />\nyear, 14 per cent are.<br />\nThere have also been increases in the<br />\nrate of Asian students' enrollment at<br />\nU.C.L.A., said Thomas Lifka, assistant<br />\nvice-chancellor for student academic<br />\nservices.<br />\nIn academic 1978-79, 15 per cent of the<br />\nfreshmen enrolled at U.C.L.A. were Asian<br />\nAmericans, compared to 21 percent this<br />\nyear, he reported.<br />\nOnly about 6 per cent of California highschool graduates each year are Asian<br />\nAmericans, so Asians are not \"underrepresented\" at U.C.L.A., Mr. Lifka said.<br />\nBut Henry Der, executive director of<br />\nChinese for Affirmative Action\u2014a civilrights organization based in San<br />\nFrancisco\u2014maintained that other statistics<br />\ntold another story. When admitting<br />\nCalifornia residents, the University of<br />\nCalifornia campuses typically choose from<br />\nthe top eighth of high-school graduates in<br />\nthe state. According to Mr. Der, Asian<br />\nAmerican students make up 25 per cent of<br />\nthat group. He said that by that comparison, U.C.L.A. is not admitting enough<br />\nAsian students.<br />\n\"These national universities are highly<br />\ncompetitive, and they tend to attract the<br />\nbest and the brightest,\" said Mr. Der. \"At<br />\nthe same time, they have this notion that<br />\nthey want a certain kind of mix. When they<br />\n<br />\nget a disproportionate number<br />\nqualified Asian applicants, they. don't<br />\nknow what to do.\"<br />\nConcern Is Not New<br />\n<br />\nConcern among Asian Americans over<br />\nthe admissions policies at prestigious U.S.<br />\ncolleges and universities is nothing new.<br />\nFor years, Asian Americans have worried<br />\nthat institutions are admitting white<br />\nstudents or students from other minority<br />\ngroups and turning down applications from<br />\nacademically superior Asians.<br />\nIndeed, Asian educators contend that at<br />\nmany institutions, officials limit the<br />\nnumber of Asian students because they<br />\nwant to maintain a \"mix' in terms of<br />\nstudents' talents, interests, and<br />\nbackgrounds. Asian students, said Mr.<br />\nDer, have been unfairly stereotyped as being too narrowly focused on academics and<br />\nas tending to favor mathematics and the<br />\nsciences.<br />\nMembers of the staff of the Education<br />\nDepartment's Office for Civil Rights have<br />\nmet with admissions officials at Harvard<br />\nand U.C.L.A. and have asked them to<br />\nbegin compiling statistics on their students.<br />\nThe investigations, which have been going on since June, could continue for six<br />\nmore months.<br />\nOther Investigations Under Way<br />\nHarvard and U.C.L.A. are not the only<br />\ninstitutions whose admissions policies are<br />\nbeing investigated. The civil-rights office<br />\nlast year began looking into complaints of<br />\n<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie<br />\nMellon University, the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Berkeley, and Evergreen<br />\nValley College.<br />\nIf the Education Department finds that<br />\nthey have illegally discriminated against<br />\nAsians, the institutions could lose all financial aid for their students.<br />\nDuring the Reagan Administration,<br />\nmany civil-rights activists and federal<br />\nlawmakers have accused the Education<br />\nDepartment of being slow to act on reports<br />\nof discrimination at colleges and universities. However, Mr. Anderson, Secretary<br />\nCavazos's spokesman, said the department<br />\nreviews practices at more than 200 colleges<br />\nand schools each year to check if they are<br />\ndiscriminating against members of minority groups.<br />\nStill, some observers said last week that<br />\nthey believed the Education Department<br />\nwas wasting its time by looking into<br />\ndiscrimination against Asian Americans.<br />\n\"I think it is outrageous that the Office<br />\nfor Civil Rights is doing this kind of investigation when they ignore massive<br />\namounts of discrimination\u2014particularly<br />\nregarding blacks\u2014at higher-education institutions,\" said a Congressional aide who<br />\nhas been involved in monitoring the civilrights office and asked not to be named.<br />\n\"They have taken a rifle approach to two<br />\nuniversities, while they are allowing entire state education systems to discriminate<br />\nagainst other minorities.\"<br />\n<br />\nCURRENT SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS\u2022 k<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nYou're invited to an informal information session on the<br />\nHousemaster position and on the Housemaster application process.<br />\nWe're looking for a diverse group of undergraduates with varied<br />\nexperiences to serve as Housemasters for the 19894990 academic<br />\nyear.<br />\nIf you think the job might be right for you, please come and learn<br />\nmore about it.<br />\nApplication kits will be available and the selection process will be<br />\ndescribed.<br />\nDECEMBER 14, 1988<br />\n3:30 PM<br />\nAMR I MULTIPURPOSE ROOM<br />\n<br />\nb<br />\n1<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nThere will be a second information session on Thursday, January<br />\n26, at 4:00 pm for students who cannot attend the December 14th<br />\nmeeting.

Noteworthy for its<br />\npicayunity, for example, was the recent<br />\nbrouhaha over the SAC seals selection process. However, this week's editorial controversy, the University chaplain and her<br />\ncritics, stands in sharp contrast to the usual<br />\nmundane campus sludge by raising inissues.<br />\nIn question is Chaplain Gretchen Van<br />\nUtt's use of her office to pursue her own<br />\nalleged leftist agenda. Student members of<br />\nthe College Republicans and the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization maintain that<br />\nVan Utt does so at the expense of the Office's religious function.<br />\nFar from participating in a reactionary<br />\nwitchhunt against the Chaplain (as they've<br />\nbeen accused of), these students have posed legitimate questions about the nature of<br />\nVan Utt's office: what is the imperative and<br />\ncharge of the Chaplain at Hopkins? And,<br />\nmore importantly, given her charge, what<br />\nsort of activities might she, through the<br />\npower of her office, give priority to?<br />\nThe Office of the Chaplain is a crucially<br />\nimportant one at Hopkins. Given the strictly<br />\nsecular nature of the University, the office<br />\nis the only department designated to cater<br />\nto the spiritual needs of the community. As<br />\nsuch, the Chaplain's first priority is to see<br />\nthat such needs are met.<br />\nVan Utt, a dynamic and committed individual, has worked hard during her tenure<br />\nas chaplain on such programs as the<br />\nHopkins Tutorial Project and City College<br />\ntutoring. She has also cooperated with existing student religious groups such as the<br />\nCatholic Community, Hopkins Christian<br />\nFellowship, and the Jewish Students'<br />\nAssociation.<br />\nHowever, Van Utt has neglected her first<br />\nobligation\u2014to spiritual matters\u2014in favor of<br />\nless imperative matters. In recent weeks,<br />\nshe found money to secure Abbie Hoffman<br />\nto speak to the Graduates for Social<br />\nResponsibility, a leftist political group, yet<br />\n<br />\ndid not manage to find sufficient funds for<br />\na Talmudic reading series.<br />\nAlthough Hoffman never came, the objection is not rendered less valid. The<br />\nChaplain has limited resources. As such,<br />\nshe must prioritize allocations, and if the<br />\nchoice is to err in favor of any side, it ought<br />\nto be on the side of her spiritual duties.<br />\nWhile Hoffman's agenda might overlap<br />\nin some areas with the concerns of organized religion, choosing a political speaker instead of a religious text was clearly<br />\ninappropriate.<br />\nIn addition, the recent Thanksgiving Fast<br />\nfor Third World Hunger Relief was poorly handled. The fast is an annual event with<br />\nan enthusiastic (for Hopkins) student participation rate. The chief beneficiary of the<br />\nfast has been Oxfam International, an<br />\norganization with controversial political<br />\nlinks. In maintaining the involvement of<br />\nOxfam, the Chaplain risked alienating those<br />\nwho might have participated in the fast but<br />\nwho felt morally obliged to abstain. Van<br />\nUtt should have been scrupulous in her<br />\nchoice of beneficiary\u2014more politically<br />\nneutral organizations exist which could,<br />\npresumably, work against hunger without<br />\nalienating students.<br />\nFinally, we must question her decision<br />\nto use partisan advertisements for a showing of\"The Candidate\" at her Sunday Experience. First, it is unclear how this particular movie contributes to spirituality on<br />\ncampus. Secondly, the posters, which<br />\ndepicted both the \"candidate\", Robert Redford, and then Vice-Presidential Candidate<br />\nDan Quayle in identical poses implied an<br />\neditorialization on her part. Such a move<br />\nis uncalled for in her role as an impartial<br />\nUniversity employee\u2014such tomfoolery is<br />\nbest left to the likes of the Weekend<br />\nWonderflix crew.<br />\nWe advise the Chaplain to more<br />\nthoroughly consider the possible implications of her judgement calls\u2014her funds are,<br />\nafter all, designated for our benefit, and<br />\nmust not be used in partisan ways.<br />\n<br />\n\u201eft/Amy,<br />\n<br />\nI Yer /40fE gir/A16 SORE EVEify<br />\n<br />\nSMP Oar EkEkY 14<br />\n(<br />\nEE1(...<br />\n<br />\nRea<br />\n<br />\ne/rHer or TAM-<br />\n<br />\narra, You, gar I /on<br />\nVoue Arrt-Nnon/ sootllow., Go, Ser<br />\n-raz\u2022 You Ailiv riFf/coir lr's 66-I WI77/M6<br />\nTRN6c To<br />\n<br />\nto PUMP<br />\n<br />\n/A-171/6 To VW( DF NEW samcrs\" Fete<br />\n<br />\nMON<br />\nEY!<br />\npcw'r mAre<br />\n<br />\nTISEX AND<br />\n<br />\nficRY<br />\nKONIEEN<br />\nAl AeM9e6foUrrE5:-IRE Xell)601Pli 11a4105...<br />\nMEA4WI/I1,6 11/F (*FEE 510<br />\ngoilEAPANW611,66EAPIRA AL ft/cm Aire/mf..t<br />\nCACroav.,.

The same shortsightedness of the possible misapplication of his work that caused<br />\nthe scientist, Hoenniker, to give<br />\nthe ice-nine to his children, who<br />\neventually used it to destroy the<br />\nearth, may ultimately lead to the<br />\ndestruction of our world.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that such<br />\ndrastic measures were taken by<br />\nAshera-Davis, Heid, and Kramer<br />\nto make their statement, but the<br />\nimportance of their message cannot be overlooked.<br />\nTo Dale Ashera-Davis, John<br />\nHeid, and my colleague, Richard<br />\nKramer\u2014for calling my attention<br />\nto the fact that the JHU administration is involved in things<br />\nwith which I may not agree:<br />\nGentleman, I salute you!<br />\nRoberto N.

He<br />\nfound himself in the midst of<br />\nmany curious, uncanny realizations and decided that Hopkins<br />\nstudents needed their horizons<br />\nstretched.<br />\nAround the time that Mohyuddin had these revelations, similar<br />\nefforts were being made to bring<br />\nthe Hopkins community together,<br />\nincluding the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force and the Faculty/Student Interaction Program. Both of<br />\nthese organizations were fulfilling<br />\ntheir purposes, but Mohyuddin<br />\nsaw a need for an organization<br />\nrun by the students.<br />\nHence<br />\nLyceum, which<br />\ndescribes itself as an organization<br />\n\"to integrate the Hopkins Community at all levels\u2014students,<br />\nfaculty, and administration,<br />\n<br />\nthrough cultural shows, lectures,<br />\nseminars, concerts, forums, exhibits, informal presentations by<br />\nmembers of the Community in<br />\ntheir areas of personal interest,<br />\nand other related activities.\"<br />\nAlthough Lyceum is a young<br />\norganization run primarily by one<br />\nperson, it has succeeded in drawing large, diverse groups of people to a myriad of interesting and<br />\nnovel events. The organization's<br />\naim is to address the concerns and<br />\ncultivate the interests of the entire Hopkins community. So far,<br />\nthese aims have been met. Faculty and staff, as well as students,<br />\nhave been extremely receptive to<br />\nthe programs.<br />\nLyceum's activities began last<br />\nFebruary with \"Human Sexuality and AIDS: A Panel Forum.\"<br />\nVarious panelists explained the<br />\ndisease to the audience and emphasized its impact on individuals<br />\nand society as a whole.<br />\nNumerous organizations were<br />\nrepresented, ranging from the<br />\nSchool of Public Health and<br />\nHygiene to the AIDS Control Administration of the Maryland<br />\nState Health Department.<br />\nAlso speaking was Mr. Joseph<br />\nMair. As a person with AIDS,<br />\nMair tried to help the audience<br />\nunderstand the personal and emo-<br />\n<br />\nStudents tour the Chesapeake Bay Institute on a recent Lyceum outing.<br />\ntional effects of the disease. Mr.<br />\nMair also spoke out against the<br />\nostracism of people infected with<br />\nAIDS. The forum offered<br />\nbeneficial information to the<br />\nHopkins community on an important community issue.<br />\nLyceum's second event last<br />\nyear was Women's Recognition<br />\nWeek, a program featuring films,<br />\npoetry readings, a slide presentation on \"Women at Hopkins,\"<br />\nlectures, and a panel discussion of<br />\nsexual harassment. The weeklong series focused on the concerns of women in the Hopkins<br />\n<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe third activity held last year<br />\nwas geared towards musical interests, expecially Mohyuddin's<br />\nown interest in classical music.<br />\nFaculty members Douglas Fambrough, Allan Spradling, and<br />\nDavid Pumplin (on piano, violin,<br />\nand cello respectively) practiced<br />\nfor months to perform as the<br />\nHomewood Sound Chamber Orchestra, playing selections from<br />\nthe works of Dvorak and<br />\nBeethoven.<br />\nThe final event of spring last<br />\nyear was a lecture and film<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy Lyceum<br />\n<br />\npresented by J. Krshnamurty on<br />\neducation. Mohyuddin invited<br />\nKrishnamurty because he felt that<br />\nhe and many other students were<br />\ncurious as to why they were spending so much time and energy,<br />\nnot to mention money, on their<br />\ncollege edcation.<br />\nThis past fall, Lyceum held<br />\ntours of various JHU campuses<br />\nand facilities which were virtually unknown to Homewood<br />\nstudents. The response of the<br />\nSee LYCEUM, 13<br />\n<br />\nParliamentary debate tournament held at JHU<br />\nby Ted Niblock<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Parliamentary Debate Team hosted its annual invitational tournament on<br />\nthe 18th and 19th of last month.<br />\nNo Hopkins teams actually participated in the tournament as<br />\ncompetitors, as every team member was needed to actually run<br />\nthe tournament.<br />\nAfter hosting last year's national finals, the job of running a<br />\n50-team invitational seemed far<br />\neasier for the team, although both<br />\nentailed a great deal of work. In<br />\naddition to the actual scheduling<br />\nof five rounds for each participating team, there were over<br />\n100 debaters to house, judge,<br />\ndirect, and generally keep<br />\nentertained.<br />\nThe two most difficult jobs facing the team in preparation for the<br />\ntournament were to find housing<br />\nfor all the visiting teams in the<br />\ndorms, and ensure that there<br />\nwould be enough qualified judges<br />\nto cover the 25 rounds that took<br />\nplace every two hours or so.<br />\nThe housing was provided by<br />\nfreshmen living in the dorms,<br />\nI previously signed up. In<br />\ncontrast to p. ears, the team<br />\nenlisted more housing than was<br />\nnecessary. This was because<br />\nmore than sixty teams were expected, although fifty actually<br />\n<br />\ncame. There were little or no problems with the housing, as the<br />\ndebaters arrived at the rooms late<br />\nFriday night and left early Saturday morning, leaving little time<br />\nfor any problems to occur. A<br />\ntired debater after three exhaustive rounds on Friday night<br />\nhas little appetite for anything but<br />\nsleep.<br />\nJudging was done mostly by<br />\nHopkins team members, although<br />\nsome non-debaters with high<br />\nschool or some other experience<br />\nhelped out where needed. As with<br />\nevery tournament since the beginning of time, one or two teams<br />\nleft mumbling about poor judges,<br />\nbut it must be remembered that<br />\nthe outcome is decided on the personal preferences of one person<br />\njudges are human.<br />\nBesides judging and housing,<br />\nother work went on behind the<br />\nscenes. Classrooms and lecture<br />\nhalls had to be reserved and kept<br />\nopen for rounds and meetings,<br />\nand teams had to be matched<br />\n(with each other and judges as<br />\nwell) after each round. This process, called \"tabbing,\" is dependent on the results of the previous<br />\nround, so after each round the<br />\n\"TAB Room\" explodes into fifteen minutes to a half hour of<br />\nfrenetic activity, as judges'<br />\nballots are compiled, each team's<br />\nstanding record is updated, and<br />\n<br />\nteams are paired and given a<br />\njudge and a room.<br />\nFinally there was general<br />\ntroubleshooting<br />\ndo.<br />\nto<br />\nClassrooms were inadvertently<br />\nclosed, visitors got lost, and<br />\nsomeone from the team had to be<br />\navailable in the dorms until 2<br />\na.m. Saturday. This lonesome<br />\ntask was carried out by senior<br />\ndebater Mary Frances Repko.<br />\nAtop all this confused but efficient work rode the 1988 Johns<br />\nHopkins Elvis invitational tournament, in all its pride and glory.<br />\nBut first, a word or two about the<br />\ntype of debate league Hopkins is<br />\nin. The league is extemporaneous<br />\nparliamentary debate, meaning<br />\nthere is no preparation or specific<br />\nknowledge allowed. The case is<br />\nmodeled upon a \"resolution\"<br />\nwhich is given to the two-speaker<br />\nteam moments before the debate<br />\nbegins. As a result, teams have a<br />\nfair amount of freedom as to what<br />\ncase comes from the resolution.<br />\nFor this reason, tournaments tend<br />\nto have themes, from which come<br />\na plethora of humorous resolutions. The goal is to have fun<br />\nwhile competing at skills of persuasion and spontaneous<br />\norganization.<br />\nTowards this end especially,<br />\nthe Elvis tournament was a grand<br />\nsuccess. Since we all know that<br />\nElvis is alive, well, and running<br />\n<br />\na health food store in Cuba, the<br />\ntournament had plenty of entertaining resolutions from the<br />\nsupermarket tabloids. In fact, the<br />\nfinal round, held in Remsen One<br />\nwith all of the other teams watching, incorporated the first place<br />\ntrophy of the tournament, a gilded statuette of the King himself.<br />\nThe tournament had no quarteror semi-final rounds, because only two teams were undefeated<br />\nafter the regular five rounds.<br />\nScoring in debate is based on two<br />\nfactors: speaker points and rank.<br />\nSpeaker points, given on a scale<br />\nfrom I to 30, with 30 being a<br />\nperfect speech, are awarded to<br />\neach of the four speakers in the<br />\nround. In addition, each speaker<br />\nis ranked from one to four in their<br />\nperformance relative to the<br />\nround, so each speaker strives for<br />\nhigh speaker points and low total<br />\nranks.<br />\nIn the final round, Columbia A<br />\n(Rob Kaplan and Andrew Cohen)<br />\nwere on the opposition, defeating<br />\nSwarthmore A (John Gastil and<br />\nLeslie Haravon). In addition,<br />\nawards were given to each of the<br />\nspeakers with the top ten Speaker<br />\ntotals-ranks.<br />\nIn addition to the regular<br />\nrounds, there is a \"sideshow\" at<br />\nevery tournament called simply<br />\nthe speech rounds. Any individual may enter, and the finals<br />\n<br />\nwere won by John Gastil from<br />\nSwarthmore. Hopkins speechround afficionado Howard Robbins came up with speech topics<br />\nwhose hilarious potential were<br />\nexploited in the final round.<br />\nAlthough it was not as<br />\nmonumental as last year's nationals, this year's tournament<br />\nwas an enjoyable one for all who<br />\nattended, and was also a relatively difficult but nonehtheless satisfying effort for the Hopkins<br />\nhosts.<br />\nAccording to Debate Council<br />\nPresident Aneil Shirke, \"All of<br />\nthe speakers on the team felt it<br />\nwas a great success. I want to<br />\npoint out that without the other<br />\ncouncil officers [Mary Frances<br />\nRepko, Pat Woodhall, Charles<br />\nFitzgerald, Howard Robbins]<br />\nnothing at all would have been<br />\npossible.

Kern<br />\nIn an industry where having a<br />\ndistinct \"sound\" is all-important,<br />\nmost artists bend over backwards<br />\nto make peppy and exoticsounding music. The intention<br />\nseems good; if their ambitions<br />\nwere artistic rather than financial,<br />\nthe results could be terrific. Top<br />\n40 lightweights like Julio Iglesias<br />\ncould pair off with Sonic Youth;<br />\nPhil Collins might team up with<br />\nJohn Hiatt, and learn how to write<br />\nreal songs; the World Saxophone<br />\nQuartet could be Tiffany's<br />\nbackup band. Such collaborations<br />\nmight prove hideous, but they<br />\nwouldn't be dull.<br />\nUnfortunately, pop comprises<br />\na world fraught with borders and<br />\nlimitations. Lock twenty bands in<br />\nthe same place\u2014like the Top<br />\n40\u2014and soon enough they'll be<br />\nplaying the same song. Thankfully, dozens of bands who have a<br />\nchoice elect to avoid the<br />\n\"me-too\" world of pop, and<br />\nfollow their own ears. The otherworldly Feelies are a glowing example. Over the course of three<br />\nrecords released since 1978, this<br />\nneglected New Jersey quintet has<br />\ncreated and stubbornly adhered to<br />\nits own eccentric musical<br />\nvocabulary, with dazzling results.<br />\nThe Feelies' current record,<br />\nOnly Life (Coyote/A&M 5214;<br />\nCD, LP, and cassette), suggests<br />\na fine-tuning of the band's subtle<br />\narranging style. The misty sound<br />\n<br />\nthat so elegantly framed 1986's<br />\nThe Good Earth (Coyote 8673;<br />\nall three formats) has been replaced with a crispness that<br />\nstreamlines the music. Tight, circular rhythms battle with gunshot<br />\nsnare hits as each song grows<br />\nfrom pieces into fearsome arrays<br />\nof counterpoint. Chief songwriter<br />\nGlenn Mercer's languid vocals,<br />\nsung in a \"Voice of Doom\"-like<br />\nmonotone, hover eerily over his<br />\nand Bill Million's guttural guitar<br />\nlines. The whole production is utterly without fat; every note has<br />\na purpose.<br />\nAs with the band's earlier efforts, Only Life's unequivocal<br />\nshowpiece is its instrumental<br />\nwork. The record runs chiefly on<br />\nthe group's extraordinary sense<br />\nof rhythm, texture, and tempo.<br />\nVariation in tones is given far less<br />\nemphasis than rhythm, and<br />\nMillion and Mercer compensate<br />\nhandsomely for the omission.<br />\nBoth have splendidly delicate<br />\npalates, rife with textures. So<br />\nmuch goes on throughout the<br />\nrecord rhythmically that the<br />\nband's almost-stoic approach to<br />\ntone\u2014they employ small tonal<br />\ncenters except when soloing\u2014<br />\noften goes unnoticed. In the more<br />\ndensely-arranged pieces, such as<br />\n\"Deep Fascination,\" Mercer offers lovely bursts of color; happily, these come in shades of<br />\ngray.<br />\nListening to Only Life as an instrumental record is rewarding.<br />\n<br />\nMercer restrains his vocals<br />\nmarkedly, and relies on his voice<br />\nmore as a stabilizing force than<br />\nas a lead instrument. Each of the<br />\ninstrumental tracks comes<br />\ntogether like a polyrhythmic<br />\npuzzle\u2014drums, percussion, bass,<br />\nfirst guitar, and second guitar<br />\neach follow their own path, converging in sly juxtapositions of<br />\ntexture. Heard separately, the<br />\nparts seem repetitive and lifeless;<br />\ncombined, they lock neatly into<br />\nplace and grind out amazing<br />\nbursts of energy.<br />\nSome tracks are downright<br />\nrowdy. The Feelies' signature is<br />\nincessant rhythm, however complex, and once started, the pieces<br />\nrun like musical engines revving<br />\nin place. \"Too Much\" and<br />\n\"Higher Ground\" offer surprising grace; one marvels at the<br />\nperfection of their rhythmic<br />\nmovement. \"For Awhile\" and<br />\n\"Too Far Gone\" are rollicking<br />\nduels between bassist Brenda<br />\nSauter and drummer Dave<br />\nWeckerman. Mercer and Million<br />\nsculpture minute musical figures<br />\nin the air, relenting only in their<br />\nbrief, stately solos.<br />\nWhere most pop bands swamp<br />\ntheir songs in a glaze of effects,<br />\nthe Feelies break song structures<br />\ndown to their rhythmical bones,<br />\nfiltering themes and music alike<br />\ninto their own language. The process is akin to a musical sieve: the<br />\nband takes a composition, shakes<br />\naway the trimmings and fat, and<br />\n<br />\nWIT<br />\nWHILE IT'S HOT<br />\n<br />\nconstructs a performance from translating poetry from a foreign<br />\nthe sediment.

The<br />\nnarrator is Jim Holder, a conscientious objector who refuses<br />\n\"to kill anyone with a gun, or<br />\nwith anything except good intentions.\" Exempted from military<br />\nservice by the draft board in his<br />\nhometown of Malta, Indiana, he<br />\nsets out to perform alternative<br />\nservice at a large metropolitan<br />\nhospital in Chicago where he<br />\nfinds more death and bloodshed<br />\nthan he could have imagined.<br />\nSo begins Saigon, Illinois, a<br />\nfirst novel by Chicago native Paul<br />\nHoover.<br />\nThe novel follows Holder on<br />\nhis daily rounds as a unit manager<br />\nin the hospital. On his first working day, a patient has a cardiac arrest. Holder helps out in the effort to save him, but to no avail.<br />\nAfter the death, he takes the patient's body to the morgue and<br />\ngathers up his belongings to give<br />\nback to the family.<br />\nMany more patients die during<br />\nHolder's tenure at the hospital,<br />\nincluding Jack Triplet, a<br />\nquadriplegic who had kept a<br />\npistol by his bedside despite his<br />\ninability to use it. Holder finds<br />\nhimself picking up the belongings<br />\nof his former friend:<br />\n\"It was always harder to take<br />\nthe body to the morgue and collect the valuables when I knew the<br />\nperson. Standing next to his<br />\nbody, listing the pairs of socks<br />\n<br />\nand searching for the second<br />\nshoe, I half expected Jack to sit<br />\nup and talk to me.\"<br />\nLife after hours is no less<br />\ntumultuous for Holder. His<br />\nChicago roommates include a<br />\nrevolutionary wheeler-dealer, a<br />\nrich-boy Troskyite, and a speedfreak poet. With these and other<br />\ncharacters he embroils himself in<br />\nthe violence and tumult that is late<br />\n1960's Chicago. But while many<br />\nof his acquaintances resort to<br />\ndrastic measures in order to take<br />\ncontrol of their lives and to define<br />\nthemselves against the system,<br />\nHolder refuses to make any commitments. He participates in an<br />\nanti-war demonstration, but attempts to escape when the police<br />\narrive.<br />\nHolder's reluctance to protest<br />\nis a pervasive theme throughout<br />\nthe book. This is illustrated most<br />\nclearly when his girlfriend gets<br />\npregnant. He tells her that he does<br />\nnot want to commit himself to<br />\nmarriage or child rearing, but in<br />\nthe end, he forces her to have an<br />\nabortion. His stance is enough to<br />\nconvince her to go ahead with the<br />\nabortion, something she is morally opposed to. Since Holder is unwilling to make a commitment to<br />\nhis girlfriend, the reader assumes<br />\nthat she feels her pregnancy is no<br />\nlonger legitimate. We assume this<br />\nwithout direct explication on the<br />\nnarrator's part.<br />\nThe author prefers not to state<br />\nhis ideas clearly. In some parts,<br />\nlike the previous example, it is ef-<br />\n<br />\nfective, but this is an exception.<br />\nHolder does not explicitly state<br />\nwhat his reactions are to the<br />\ndeaths that occur in the hospital<br />\nwhere he works until halfway into the novel.<br />\n\"Even though I'd become<br />\nhardened to these scenes of death,<br />\nI felt like I'd been punched in the<br />\nstomach.\"<br />\nThis is his reaction to the death,<br />\nby leukemia, of a five-year old<br />\nboy. While this is a believable<br />\nreaction in itself, it does not<br />\nreveal much else to the reader<br />\nbesides a simple gut reaction.<br />\nIn the pages before this scene,<br />\nthere is hardly any reaction on the<br />\npart of the narrator to the blur of<br />\nhospital tragedies that are<br />\ndescribed in deadpan, slightly<br />\nironic language. Where these<br />\nreactions occur in the second half<br />\nof the book, they are very effective, as are the scenes of hospital<br />\nlife and streetside Chicago turmoil are quite remarkable. But<br />\nthe narration is inconsistent<br />\nbecause we are not given enough<br />\ninsights into the narrator's<br />\npersonality.<br />\nDespite this flaw, the main<br />\ntheme of the book is relatively<br />\nclear. Holder must find a way to<br />\nreconcile his actions with his nonviolent religious beliefs, although<br />\nwe are never told how strong they<br />\nare. He becomes convinced,<br />\nslowly, that there is only one true<br />\ncourse of action. His C.O. status<br />\nis not an act of resistance, it is<br />\nmerely a concession.

The conflict is clear,<br />\nbut the outcome is not what we<br />\nexpect and he never really does<br />\nmake the decision.

The Blue Jays blew an<br />\neight-point halftime lead and<br />\nwere out-rebounded 51-24 by the<br />\nYellow Jackets, who remained<br />\nunbeaten by improving their<br />\nrecord to 4-0. Hopkins dropped<br />\nto 2-2.<br />\nThe Blue Jays took control early in the game with some excellent outside shooting. Jedan<br />\nPhillips, the senior co-captain,<br />\ncame out on fire, connecting for<br />\neight points in the first seven<br />\nminutes of the game. Phillips,<br />\nhowever, had to be taken out of<br />\nthe game with 12:32 left to play<br />\nin the first half when he picked<br />\nup two fouls while guarding<br />\nJonathan Jones, Rochester's prolific scorer. Andy Enfield quickly picked up where Phillips left<br />\noff, and his third three-pointer of<br />\nthe game gave Hopkins a ten<br />\npoint lead with eight minutes remaining in the half. Enfield had<br />\nsixteen points and four three<br />\npointers in the first twenty<br />\nminutes, as the Jays took a 44-37<br />\nlead into the locker room at half<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe Yellow Jackets stormed<br />\nback at the beginning of the second half, as their dominance of<br />\nthe boards finally began to pay<br />\noff. Jones, who was averaging<br />\n30.7 points per game coming into Wednesday's match-up, finally began to connect as Rochester<br />\ngrabbed a 62-56 lead with 10:46<br />\nleft in the game.<br />\nJedan Phillips, however, once<br />\nagain sparked the Hopkins offense and put the Blue Jays right<br />\nback in the game. Phillips converted two key three-point plays<br />\n<br />\nby driving to the hoop and drawing the foul, and his beautiful<br />\nscoop shot gave Hopkins a 71-70<br />\nlead with two minutes to play.<br />\nPhillips led all scorers with<br />\ntwenty-four points by hitting<br />\n11-15 from the floor.<br />\nRochester regained a three<br />\npoint lead with just under a<br />\nminute left after two key turnovers by the Blue Jays. With<br />\nHopkins trailing 74-71, Phillips<br />\nwent to the line with twenty<br />\nseconds remaining. However, he<br />\nmissed both free throws, and the<br />\nYellow Jackets' Dave Reilly sealed the Rochester victory by connecting twice from the charity<br />\nstripe to make the final score<br />\n76-71.<br />\nIn the season opener, Hopkins<br />\neasily defeated the University of<br />\nChicago 93-73 in front of a nearcapacity crowd at the Newton<br />\nWhite Athletic Center. As in the<br />\nRochester game, Phillips provided the initial scoring spark for the<br />\nBlue Jays, hitting five of six shots<br />\nfrom the floor and finishing with<br />\ntwelve points. Joel Siepiereski<br />\ntook advantage of the weak inside<br />\nplay of the Maroons, as he banged the offensive boards and<br />\nscored twenty-one points.<br />\nSiepiereski, who even ventured<br />\nout to hit a three-pointer,<br />\ndemonstrated why he had the<br />\nsecond-best shooting record in the<br />\nMAC last year by going 10-11<br />\nfrom the field. Mike Latimore<br />\nwas also a strong force on the inside, grabbing five rebounds and<br />\nscoring twenty pionts. The<br />\nMaroons seemed to key on Enfield, trying to deny him the ball<br />\nand keep him from connecting<br />\nfrom the outside. Enfield,<br />\nhowever, responded by merely<br />\ndriving to the basket and drawing<br />\nthe foul. He went 14-14 from the<br />\nfree throw line, where he had the<br />\nfourth best shooting percentage in<br />\n<br />\nDivision III last season, and<br />\nscored nineteen points. As a<br />\nteam, Hopkins hit 29-33 from the<br />\nline, but they turned the ball over<br />\ntwenty-seven times.<br />\nTurnovers proved costly when<br />\nthe Jays travelled to Catholic<br />\nUniversity to face one of the<br />\nfinest Division III teams in the<br />\nEast. Hopkins fell behind early,<br />\nbut battled back in the second half<br />\nwhen Jay Gangemi, Mark West,<br />\nand Bill Zahn came off the bench<br />\nto spark the Blue Jays. After<br />\nHopkins tied the score at 78-78<br />\nwith only seventeen seconds remaining, Catholic was able to get<br />\noff three shots, the last of which<br />\nwent in at the buzzer to give the<br />\nCardinals a 80-78 victory.

Goodyear is faced<br />\nwith a rebuilding season.<br />\nGoodyear lost half of last year's<br />\nteam, including four of the top<br />\nfive players, to graduation. This<br />\nyear's squad unquestionably has<br />\nexcellent athletes, but this is one<br />\nof the first years in recent<br />\nmemory when no one on the team<br />\nhas had any experience playing<br />\nbefore<br />\nsquash<br />\ncoming<br />\nto Hopkins. This year, Coach<br />\nGoodyear must rely on the core<br />\nof remaining veterans for leadership and rebuild by recruiting<br />\nfreshmen athletes with experience<br />\nin other sports.<br />\nThe difficulties the team faces<br />\nwere evident on Sunday,<br />\nNovember 20th, when the Jays<br />\nlost to Cornell 1-9 and to Penn<br />\n0-9 at the University of Pennsylvania. In the match against<br />\nDivision III Cornell, the sole<br />\nHopkins winner was 9th-ranked<br />\nfreshman Michelle Steindecker,<br />\nwho won her match by scores of<br />\n15-9, 17-15, 16-17, 15-11.<br />\nSeniors Kathy Hart and Alice<br />\nCollins, playing at number one<br />\nand two respectively, both lost<br />\n3-0. Senior captain Chris Emmick battled to a 1-3 loss while<br />\njuniors Kathryn Ng and Laura<br />\nGaffney both lost in three<br />\nstraight. Sixth-seeded freshman<br />\nTara Dorr lost 15-12, 15-9, 15-11<br />\nand fellow freshman Karran<br />\nPhillips lost 16-4, 15-8, 15-9.<br />\nSophomore Dawn Stoner fell<br />\n15-9, 15-4, 15-6.<br />\nIn a tough match versus Division II Penn, all of the Jays lost<br />\n3-0. Although Hopkins played<br />\nsome good points, they were not<br />\nconsistent enough throughout, but<br />\nmany players felt that they had<br />\nplayed better in this match than<br />\n<br />\nin the one against Cornell.<br />\nLess than two hours after these<br />\nfound<br />\nHopkins<br />\ndefeats,<br />\nthemselves facing Haverford, a<br />\nweak team that Hopkins usually<br />\ndominates.<br />\nLast year the Blue Jays blanked the Red Wave three times.<br />\nThis year, Haverford has vowed<br />\nto fight their way out of the intercollegiate squash cellar.<br />\nNevertheless, despite their fatigue<br />\nand their earlier defeats, Hopkins<br />\nprevailed 8-1. Hart lost a close<br />\n1-3 match as teammate Collins<br />\ncame back from a 0-2 deficit and<br />\noutlasted her opponent 7-15,<br />\n10-15, 15-9, 16-15, 16-14. With<br />\nthe bulk of Haverford's strength<br />\nconcentrated in their top two<br />\nplayers, the rest of the matches<br />\nwent considerably smoother for<br />\nHopkins: Emmick won 16-13,<br />\n15-4,15-1, Ng won 15-9, 15-8,<br />\n17-14, and Gaffney won 15-7,<br />\n15-9, 18-17. The rookies had<br />\nseveral impressive wins. Dorr<br />\nslammed her opponent 15-3,<br />\n15-0, 15-2; Phillips rolled 15-2,<br />\n15-2, 15-6; and Stoner crushed<br />\nher foe with a 15-5, 15-5, 15-2<br />\nwin. Steindecker won 15-6, 15-7,<br />\n15-8 and senior Laura Harwook<br />\nwon 15-6, 15-2, 15-7.<br />\nDespite an uneven performance<br />\nin their first outing. Hopkins's<br />\nfuture looks bright. Coach<br />\nGoodyear is especially pleased<br />\nwith the showing of his rookies,<br />\nwho demonstrated good skills in<br />\ntheir first matches. It's still early<br />\nin the season, and as Hopkins<br />\nbecomes used to competition,<br />\nthey will only improve. Tomorrow the squad flies up to Connecticut to play all weekend in the<br />\nWesleyan Tournament, which<br />\nwill close out the fall portion of<br />\nthe season.<br />\n<br />\n811-5NNU4WW<br />\n<br />\n*******************<br />\n<br />\nWelcome Back!!<br />\n<br />\nJHU<br />\n<br />\nGuaranteed<br />\nLowest<br />\nFares!!<br />\nALL<br />\n\"SERVICES\"<br />\nARE ABSOLUTELY<br />\nFREE, QUICK*<br />\nCONVENIENT<br />\n'We're Right in Your Backyard'<br />\n<br />\n467-9300<br />\n:/ Amedcon<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSodety<br />\nofTravel Agents<br />\n<br />\nLocated In The Rotunda Man<br />\nUp the Ramp From the Giant<br />\nflake the Shuttle or Just Call)<br />\n<br />\nSewing Baltimore & JHU Since 1982<br />\nVb1.111.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Air Tickets.<br />\n\u2022Amtrak\u2022<br />\n*Packages.<br />\n\u2022Cruises\u2022<br />\n\u2022Tours\u2022<br />\n\u2022Free V.I.P.

Pat Gibbons initiated the<br />\nscoring effort after winning the<br />\nopening face-off and dumping the<br />\npuck in around the boards. A<br />\nWestern Maryland defenseman<br />\nthen intercepted the puck only to<br />\nget checked by right winger Bill<br />\nMarquardt behind the net. Jay<br />\nCawkins then picked up the loose<br />\npuck and passed it back to Mike<br />\nHolmes, who rifled a slapshot<br />\nfrom the point. Although Western<br />\nMaryland's goalie made the save,<br />\nMarquardt was perfectly positioned for the rebound and made<br />\nno mistake finding an opening on<br />\nthe right side of the net.<br />\nFor the rest of the first period,<br />\nthe game was filled with penalties<br />\nranging fom too many men on the<br />\nice to fighting. Mark Koren firmly established the mood of the<br />\ngame as he and a Western<br />\nMarylander both received game<br />\nmisconducts for fighting. Later<br />\non in the first period, the referee<br />\nmade a very questionable call on<br />\nPat Gibbons. Gibbons, after picking up the puck around center ice,<br />\nskated inside the opponents' blue<br />\n<br />\nline. He put a move on the<br />\ndefenseman and then took a shot.<br />\nWestern Maryland's goalie left<br />\nthe crease and knocked Gibbons<br />\ndown, prompting the referee to<br />\nblow the whistle. After Gibbons<br />\ngot up, he saw the goalie charging towards him and pushed him<br />\nback in self-defense. Gibbons was<br />\nsubsequently jumped from behind<br />\nby a Western Maryland player,<br />\nand not wanting to retaliate, Gibbons lowered himself to the ice to<br />\navoid a penalty. The opposing<br />\nplayer then proceeded to pummel<br />\nGibbons in the back while the<br />\nreferee and linesman simply<br />\nlooked on, making no attempt to<br />\nbreak up the lopsided brawl.<br />\nEventually, the hostile encounter<br />\nended with both players getting<br />\nthrown out of the game.

Anderson, a spokesman for<br />\nEducation Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos,<br />\nsaid no specific complaints of discrimination had been filed against the institutions.<br />\nBut he said concern had been expressed by<br />\nlawmakers, parents, and students about admissions policies at the two universities,<br />\n\"We're not going into this saying Haryard is discriminating and U.C.L.A. is<br />\ndiscriminating,\" said Mr. Anderson. \"But<br />\nthere have been public allegations made<br />\nthat there may be a quota system limiting<br />\nAsians, and we have got to go out there<br />\nand check on the health of the system.\"<br />\n\"We Absolutely Do Not Discriminate\"<br />\nOfficials at both Harvard and U.C.L.A.<br />\nvehemently denied that their institutions<br />\nhad used quotas to restrict Asian students.<br />\n\"We absolutely do not discriminate and<br />\ndo not have quotas set against Asian<br />\nAmericans or any other group,\" said Susie<br />\nChao, an admissions officer at Harvard<br />\nUniversity. \"We'd like to bring in the<br />\nmost talented students, and to limit<br />\nourselves in any way\u2014besides being<br /><br />\nillegal\u2014 would be detrimental in the long<br />\nrun.\"<br />\nMs. Chao said the proportion of students<br />\nat Harvard who are Asian Americans has<br />\nnearly tripled in the last 10 years. In<br />\nacademic 1978-79, she said, 5 percent of<br />\nthe freshmen at Harvard were Asians. This<br />\nyear, 14 per cent are.<br />\nThere have also been increases in the<br />\nrate of Asian students' enrollment at<br />\nU.C.L.A., said Thomas Lifka, assistant<br />\nvice-chancellor for student academic<br />\nservices.<br />\nIn academic 1978-79, 15 per cent of the<br />\nfreshmen enrolled at U.C.L.A. were Asian<br />\nAmericans, compared to 21 percent this<br />\nyear, he reported.<br />\nOnly about 6 per cent of California highschool graduates each year are Asian<br />\nAmericans, so Asians are not \"underrepresented\" at U.C.L.A., Mr. Lifka said.<br />\nBut Henry Der, executive director of<br />\nChinese for Affirmative Action\u2014a civilrights organization based in San<br />\nFrancisco\u2014maintained that other statistics<br />\ntold another story. When admitting<br />\nCalifornia residents, the University of<br />\nCalifornia campuses typically choose from<br />\nthe top eighth of high-school graduates in<br />\nthe state. According to Mr. Der, Asian<br />\nAmerican students make up 25 per cent of<br />\nthat group. He said that by that comparison, U.C.L.A. is not admitting enough<br />\nAsian students.<br />\n\"These national universities are highly<br />\ncompetitive, and they tend to attract the<br />\nbest and the brightest,\" said Mr. Der. \"At<br />\nthe same time, they have this notion that<br />\nthey want a certain kind of mix. When they<br /><br />\nget a disproportionate number<br />\nqualified Asian applicants, they. don't<br />\nknow what to do.\"<br />\nConcern Is Not New<br /><br />\nConcern among Asian Americans over<br />\nthe admissions policies at prestigious U.S.<br />\ncolleges and universities is nothing new.<br />\nFor years, Asian Americans have worried<br />\nthat institutions are admitting white<br />\nstudents or students from other minority<br />\ngroups and turning down applications from<br />\nacademically superior Asians.<br />\nIndeed, Asian educators contend that at<br />\nmany institutions, officials limit the<br />\nnumber of Asian students because they<br />\nwant to maintain a \"mix' in terms of<br />\nstudents' talents, interests, and<br />\nbackgrounds. Asian students, said Mr.<br />\nDer, have been unfairly stereotyped as being too narrowly focused on academics and<br />\nas tending to favor mathematics and the<br />\nsciences.<br />\nMembers of the staff of the Education<br />\nDepartment's Office for Civil Rights have<br />\nmet with admissions officials at Harvard<br />\nand U.C.L.A. and have asked them to<br />\nbegin compiling statistics on their students.<br />\nThe investigations, which have been going on since June, could continue for six<br />\nmore months.<br />\nOther Investigations Under Way<br />\nHarvard and U.C.L.A. are not the only<br />\ninstitutions whose admissions policies are<br />\nbeing investigated. The civil-rights office<br />\nlast year began looking into complaints of<br /><br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie<br />\nMellon University, the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Berkeley, and Evergreen<br />\nValley College.<br />\nIf the Education Department finds that<br />\nthey have illegally discriminated against<br />\nAsians, the institutions could lose all financial aid for their students.<br />\nDuring the Reagan Administration,<br />\nmany civil-rights activists and federal<br />\nlawmakers have accused the Education<br />\nDepartment of being slow to act on reports<br />\nof discrimination at colleges and universities. However, Mr. Anderson, Secretary<br />\nCavazos's spokesman, said the department<br />\nreviews practices at more than 200 colleges<br />\nand schools each year to check if they are<br />\ndiscriminating against members of minority groups.<br />\nStill, some observers said last week that<br />\nthey believed the Education Department<br />\nwas wasting its time by looking into<br />\ndiscrimination against Asian Americans.<br />\n\"I think it is outrageous that the Office<br />\nfor Civil Rights is doing this kind of investigation when they ignore massive<br />\namounts of discrimination\u2014particularly<br />\nregarding blacks\u2014at higher-education institutions,\" said a Congressional aide who<br />\nhas been involved in monitoring the civilrights office and asked not to be named.<br />\n\"They have taken a rifle approach to two<br />\nuniversities, while they are allowing entire state education systems to discriminate<br />\nagainst other minorities.\"<br /><br />\nCURRENT SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS\u2022 k<br />\n1<br /><br />\nYou're invited to an informal information session on the<br />\nHousemaster position and on the Housemaster application process.<br />\nWe're looking for a diverse group of undergraduates with varied<br />\nexperiences to serve as Housemasters for the 19894990 academic<br />\nyear.<br />\nIf you think the job might be right for you, please come and learn<br />\nmore about it.<br />\nApplication kits will be available and the selection process will be<br />\ndescribed.<br />\nDECEMBER 14, 1988<br />\n3:30 PM<br />\nAMR I MULTIPURPOSE ROOM<br /><br />\nb<br />\n1<br />\nt<br /><br />\nThere will be a second information session on Thursday, January<br />\n26, at 4:00 pm for students who cannot attend the December 14th<br />\nmeeting.

Noteworthy for its<br />\npicayunity, for example, was the recent<br />\nbrouhaha over the SAC seals selection process. However, this week's editorial controversy, the University chaplain and her<br />\ncritics, stands in sharp contrast to the usual<br />\nmundane campus sludge by raising inissues.<br />\nIn question is Chaplain Gretchen Van<br />\nUtt's use of her office to pursue her own<br />\nalleged leftist agenda. Student members of<br />\nthe College Republicans and the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization maintain that<br />\nVan Utt does so at the expense of the Office's religious function.<br />\nFar from participating in a reactionary<br />\nwitchhunt against the Chaplain (as they've<br />\nbeen accused of), these students have posed legitimate questions about the nature of<br />\nVan Utt's office: what is the imperative and<br />\ncharge of the Chaplain at Hopkins? And,<br />\nmore importantly, given her charge, what<br />\nsort of activities might she, through the<br />\npower of her office, give priority to?<br />\nThe Office of the Chaplain is a crucially<br />\nimportant one at Hopkins. Given the strictly<br />\nsecular nature of the University, the office<br />\nis the only department designated to cater<br />\nto the spiritual needs of the community. As<br />\nsuch, the Chaplain's first priority is to see<br />\nthat such needs are met.<br />\nVan Utt, a dynamic and committed individual, has worked hard during her tenure<br />\nas chaplain on such programs as the<br />\nHopkins Tutorial Project and City College<br />\ntutoring. She has also cooperated with existing student religious groups such as the<br />\nCatholic Community, Hopkins Christian<br />\nFellowship, and the Jewish Students'<br />\nAssociation.<br />\nHowever, Van Utt has neglected her first<br />\nobligation\u2014to spiritual matters\u2014in favor of<br />\nless imperative matters. In recent weeks,<br />\nshe found money to secure Abbie Hoffman<br />\nto speak to the Graduates for Social<br />\nResponsibility, a leftist political group, yet<br /><br />\ndid not manage to find sufficient funds for<br />\na Talmudic reading series.<br />\nAlthough Hoffman never came, the objection is not rendered less valid. The<br />\nChaplain has limited resources. As such,<br />\nshe must prioritize allocations, and if the<br />\nchoice is to err in favor of any side, it ought<br />\nto be on the side of her spiritual duties.<br />\nWhile Hoffman's agenda might overlap<br />\nin some areas with the concerns of organized religion, choosing a political speaker instead of a religious text was clearly<br />\ninappropriate.<br />\nIn addition, the recent Thanksgiving Fast<br />\nfor Third World Hunger Relief was poorly handled. The fast is an annual event with<br />\nan enthusiastic (for Hopkins) student participation rate. The chief beneficiary of the<br />\nfast has been Oxfam International, an<br />\norganization with controversial political<br />\nlinks. In maintaining the involvement of<br />\nOxfam, the Chaplain risked alienating those<br />\nwho might have participated in the fast but<br />\nwho felt morally obliged to abstain. Van<br />\nUtt should have been scrupulous in her<br />\nchoice of beneficiary\u2014more politically<br />\nneutral organizations exist which could,<br />\npresumably, work against hunger without<br />\nalienating students.<br />\nFinally, we must question her decision<br />\nto use partisan advertisements for a showing of\"The Candidate\" at her Sunday Experience. First, it is unclear how this particular movie contributes to spirituality on<br />\ncampus. Secondly, the posters, which<br />\ndepicted both the \"candidate\", Robert Redford, and then Vice-Presidential Candidate<br />\nDan Quayle in identical poses implied an<br />\neditorialization on her part. Such a move<br />\nis uncalled for in her role as an impartial<br />\nUniversity employee\u2014such tomfoolery is<br />\nbest left to the likes of the Weekend<br />\nWonderflix crew.<br />\nWe advise the Chaplain to more<br />\nthoroughly consider the possible implications of her judgement calls\u2014her funds are,<br />\nafter all, designated for our benefit, and<br />\nmust not be used in partisan ways.<br /><br />\n\u201eft/Amy,<br /><br />\nI Yer /40fE gir/A16 SORE EVEify<br /><br />\nSMP Oar EkEkY 14<br />\n(<br />\nEE1(...<br /><br />\nRea<br /><br />\ne/rHer or TAM-<br /><br />\narra, You, gar I /on<br />\nVoue Arrt-Nnon/ sootllow., Go, Ser<br />\n-raz\u2022 You Ailiv riFf/coir lr's 66-I WI77/M6<br />\nTRN6c To<br /><br />\nto PUMP<br /><br />\n/A-171/6 To VW( DF NEW samcrs\" Fete<br /><br />\nMON<br />\nEY!<br />\npcw'r mAre<br /><br />\nTISEX AND<br /><br />\nficRY<br />\nKONIEEN<br />\nAl AeM9e6foUrrE5:-IRE Xell)601Pli 11a4105...<br />\nMEA4WI/I1,6 11/F (*FEE 510<br />\ngoilEAPANW611,66EAPIRA AL ft/cm Aire/mf..t<br />\nCACroav.,.

The same shortsightedness of the possible misapplication of his work that caused<br />\nthe scientist, Hoenniker, to give<br />\nthe ice-nine to his children, who<br />\neventually used it to destroy the<br />\nearth, may ultimately lead to the<br />\ndestruction of our world.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that such<br />\ndrastic measures were taken by<br />\nAshera-Davis, Heid, and Kramer<br />\nto make their statement, but the<br />\nimportance of their message cannot be overlooked.<br />\nTo Dale Ashera-Davis, John<br />\nHeid, and my colleague, Richard<br />\nKramer\u2014for calling my attention<br />\nto the fact that the JHU administration is involved in things<br />\nwith which I may not agree:<br />\nGentleman, I salute you!<br />\nRoberto N.

He<br />\nfound himself in the midst of<br />\nmany curious, uncanny realizations and decided that Hopkins<br />\nstudents needed their horizons<br />\nstretched.<br />\nAround the time that Mohyuddin had these revelations, similar<br />\nefforts were being made to bring<br />\nthe Hopkins community together,<br />\nincluding the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force and the Faculty/Student Interaction Program. Both of<br />\nthese organizations were fulfilling<br />\ntheir purposes, but Mohyuddin<br />\nsaw a need for an organization<br />\nrun by the students.<br />\nHence<br />\nLyceum, which<br />\ndescribes itself as an organization<br />\n\"to integrate the Hopkins Community at all levels\u2014students,<br />\nfaculty, and administration,<br /><br />\nthrough cultural shows, lectures,<br />\nseminars, concerts, forums, exhibits, informal presentations by<br />\nmembers of the Community in<br />\ntheir areas of personal interest,<br />\nand other related activities.\"<br />\nAlthough Lyceum is a young<br />\norganization run primarily by one<br />\nperson, it has succeeded in drawing large, diverse groups of people to a myriad of interesting and<br />\nnovel events. The organization's<br />\naim is to address the concerns and<br />\ncultivate the interests of the entire Hopkins community. So far,<br />\nthese aims have been met. Faculty and staff, as well as students,<br />\nhave been extremely receptive to<br />\nthe programs.<br />\nLyceum's activities began last<br />\nFebruary with \"Human Sexuality and AIDS: A Panel Forum.\"<br />\nVarious panelists explained the<br />\ndisease to the audience and emphasized its impact on individuals<br />\nand society as a whole.<br />\nNumerous organizations were<br />\nrepresented, ranging from the<br />\nSchool of Public Health and<br />\nHygiene to the AIDS Control Administration of the Maryland<br />\nState Health Department.<br />\nAlso speaking was Mr. Joseph<br />\nMair. As a person with AIDS,<br />\nMair tried to help the audience<br />\nunderstand the personal and emo-<br /><br />\nStudents tour the Chesapeake Bay Institute on a recent Lyceum outing.<br />\ntional effects of the disease. Mr.<br />\nMair also spoke out against the<br />\nostracism of people infected with<br />\nAIDS. The forum offered<br />\nbeneficial information to the<br />\nHopkins community on an important community issue.<br />\nLyceum's second event last<br />\nyear was Women's Recognition<br />\nWeek, a program featuring films,<br />\npoetry readings, a slide presentation on \"Women at Hopkins,\"<br />\nlectures, and a panel discussion of<br />\nsexual harassment. The weeklong series focused on the concerns of women in the Hopkins<br /><br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe third activity held last year<br />\nwas geared towards musical interests, expecially Mohyuddin's<br />\nown interest in classical music.<br />\nFaculty members Douglas Fambrough, Allan Spradling, and<br />\nDavid Pumplin (on piano, violin,<br />\nand cello respectively) practiced<br />\nfor months to perform as the<br />\nHomewood Sound Chamber Orchestra, playing selections from<br />\nthe works of Dvorak and<br />\nBeethoven.<br />\nThe final event of spring last<br />\nyear was a lecture and film<br /><br />\nCourtesy Lyceum<br /><br />\npresented by J. Krshnamurty on<br />\neducation. Mohyuddin invited<br />\nKrishnamurty because he felt that<br />\nhe and many other students were<br />\ncurious as to why they were spending so much time and energy,<br />\nnot to mention money, on their<br />\ncollege edcation.<br />\nThis past fall, Lyceum held<br />\ntours of various JHU campuses<br />\nand facilities which were virtually unknown to Homewood<br />\nstudents. The response of the<br />\nSee LYCEUM, 13<br /><br />\nParliamentary debate tournament held at JHU<br />\nby Ted Niblock<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Parliamentary Debate Team hosted its annual invitational tournament on<br />\nthe 18th and 19th of last month.<br />\nNo Hopkins teams actually participated in the tournament as<br />\ncompetitors, as every team member was needed to actually run<br />\nthe tournament.<br />\nAfter hosting last year's national finals, the job of running a<br />\n50-team invitational seemed far<br />\neasier for the team, although both<br />\nentailed a great deal of work. In<br />\naddition to the actual scheduling<br />\nof five rounds for each participating team, there were over<br />\n100 debaters to house, judge,<br />\ndirect, and generally keep<br />\nentertained.<br />\nThe two most difficult jobs facing the team in preparation for the<br />\ntournament were to find housing<br />\nfor all the visiting teams in the<br />\ndorms, and ensure that there<br />\nwould be enough qualified judges<br />\nto cover the 25 rounds that took<br />\nplace every two hours or so.<br />\nThe housing was provided by<br />\nfreshmen living in the dorms,<br />\nI previously signed up. In<br />\ncontrast to p. ears, the team<br />\nenlisted more housing than was<br />\nnecessary. This was because<br />\nmore than sixty teams were expected, although fifty actually<br /><br />\ncame. There were little or no problems with the housing, as the<br />\ndebaters arrived at the rooms late<br />\nFriday night and left early Saturday morning, leaving little time<br />\nfor any problems to occur. A<br />\ntired debater after three exhaustive rounds on Friday night<br />\nhas little appetite for anything but<br />\nsleep.<br />\nJudging was done mostly by<br />\nHopkins team members, although<br />\nsome non-debaters with high<br />\nschool or some other experience<br />\nhelped out where needed. As with<br />\nevery tournament since the beginning of time, one or two teams<br />\nleft mumbling about poor judges,<br />\nbut it must be remembered that<br />\nthe outcome is decided on the personal preferences of one person<br />\njudges are human.<br />\nBesides judging and housing,<br />\nother work went on behind the<br />\nscenes. Classrooms and lecture<br />\nhalls had to be reserved and kept<br />\nopen for rounds and meetings,<br />\nand teams had to be matched<br />\n(with each other and judges as<br />\nwell) after each round. This process, called \"tabbing,\" is dependent on the results of the previous<br />\nround, so after each round the<br />\n\"TAB Room\" explodes into fifteen minutes to a half hour of<br />\nfrenetic activity, as judges'<br />\nballots are compiled, each team's<br />\nstanding record is updated, and<br /><br />\nteams are paired and given a<br />\njudge and a room.<br />\nFinally there was general<br />\ntroubleshooting<br />\ndo.<br />\nto<br />\nClassrooms were inadvertently<br />\nclosed, visitors got lost, and<br />\nsomeone from the team had to be<br />\navailable in the dorms until 2<br />\na.m. Saturday. This lonesome<br />\ntask was carried out by senior<br />\ndebater Mary Frances Repko.<br />\nAtop all this confused but efficient work rode the 1988 Johns<br />\nHopkins Elvis invitational tournament, in all its pride and glory.<br />\nBut first, a word or two about the<br />\ntype of debate league Hopkins is<br />\nin. The league is extemporaneous<br />\nparliamentary debate, meaning<br />\nthere is no preparation or specific<br />\nknowledge allowed. The case is<br />\nmodeled upon a \"resolution\"<br />\nwhich is given to the two-speaker<br />\nteam moments before the debate<br />\nbegins. As a result, teams have a<br />\nfair amount of freedom as to what<br />\ncase comes from the resolution.<br />\nFor this reason, tournaments tend<br />\nto have themes, from which come<br />\na plethora of humorous resolutions. The goal is to have fun<br />\nwhile competing at skills of persuasion and spontaneous<br />\norganization.<br />\nTowards this end especially,<br />\nthe Elvis tournament was a grand<br />\nsuccess. Since we all know that<br />\nElvis is alive, well, and running<br /><br />\na health food store in Cuba, the<br />\ntournament had plenty of entertaining resolutions from the<br />\nsupermarket tabloids. In fact, the<br />\nfinal round, held in Remsen One<br />\nwith all of the other teams watching, incorporated the first place<br />\ntrophy of the tournament, a gilded statuette of the King himself.<br />\nThe tournament had no quarteror semi-final rounds, because only two teams were undefeated<br />\nafter the regular five rounds.<br />\nScoring in debate is based on two<br />\nfactors: speaker points and rank.<br />\nSpeaker points, given on a scale<br />\nfrom I to 30, with 30 being a<br />\nperfect speech, are awarded to<br />\neach of the four speakers in the<br />\nround. In addition, each speaker<br />\nis ranked from one to four in their<br />\nperformance relative to the<br />\nround, so each speaker strives for<br />\nhigh speaker points and low total<br />\nranks.<br />\nIn the final round, Columbia A<br />\n(Rob Kaplan and Andrew Cohen)<br />\nwere on the opposition, defeating<br />\nSwarthmore A (John Gastil and<br />\nLeslie Haravon). In addition,<br />\nawards were given to each of the<br />\nspeakers with the top ten Speaker<br />\ntotals-ranks.<br />\nIn addition to the regular<br />\nrounds, there is a \"sideshow\" at<br />\nevery tournament called simply<br />\nthe speech rounds. Any individual may enter, and the finals<br /><br />\nwere won by John Gastil from<br />\nSwarthmore.

Kern<br />\nIn an industry where having a<br />\ndistinct \"sound\" is all-important,<br />\nmost artists bend over backwards<br />\nto make peppy and exoticsounding music. The intention<br />\nseems good; if their ambitions<br />\nwere artistic rather than financial,<br />\nthe results could be terrific. Top<br />\n40 lightweights like Julio Iglesias<br />\ncould pair off with Sonic Youth;<br />\nPhil Collins might team up with<br />\nJohn Hiatt, and learn how to write<br />\nreal songs; the World Saxophone<br />\nQuartet could be Tiffany's<br />\nbackup band. Such collaborations<br />\nmight prove hideous, but they<br />\nwouldn't be dull.<br />\nUnfortunately, pop comprises<br />\na world fraught with borders and<br />\nlimitations. Lock twenty bands in<br />\nthe same place\u2014like the Top<br />\n40\u2014and soon enough they'll be<br />\nplaying the same song. Thankfully, dozens of bands who have a<br />\nchoice elect to avoid the<br />\n\"me-too\" world of pop, and<br />\nfollow their own ears. The otherworldly Feelies are a glowing example. Over the course of three<br />\nrecords released since 1978, this<br />\nneglected New Jersey quintet has<br />\ncreated and stubbornly adhered to<br />\nits own eccentric musical<br />\nvocabulary, with dazzling results.<br />\nThe Feelies' current record,<br />\nOnly Life (Coyote/A&amp;M 5214;<br />\nCD, LP, and cassette), suggests<br />\na fine-tuning of the band's subtle<br />\narranging style. The misty sound<br /><br />\nthat so elegantly framed 1986's<br />\nThe Good Earth (Coyote 8673;<br />\nall three formats) has been replaced with a crispness that<br />\nstreamlines the music. Tight, circular rhythms battle with gunshot<br />\nsnare hits as each song grows<br />\nfrom pieces into fearsome arrays<br />\nof counterpoint. Chief songwriter<br />\nGlenn Mercer's languid vocals,<br />\nsung in a \"Voice of Doom\"-like<br />\nmonotone, hover eerily over his<br />\nand Bill Million's guttural guitar<br />\nlines. The whole production is utterly without fat; every note has<br />\na purpose.<br />\nAs with the band's earlier efforts, Only Life's unequivocal<br />\nshowpiece is its instrumental<br />\nwork. The record runs chiefly on<br />\nthe group's extraordinary sense<br />\nof rhythm, texture, and tempo.<br />\nVariation in tones is given far less<br />\nemphasis than rhythm, and<br />\nMillion and Mercer compensate<br />\nhandsomely for the omission.<br />\nBoth have splendidly delicate<br />\npalates, rife with textures.

In the more<br />\ndensely-arranged pieces, such as<br />\n\"Deep Fascination,\" Mercer offers lovely bursts of color; happily, these come in shades of<br />\ngray.<br />\nListening to Only Life as an instrumental record is rewarding.<br /><br />\nMercer restrains his vocals<br />\nmarkedly, and relies on his voice<br />\nmore as a stabilizing force than<br />\nas a lead instrument. Each of the<br />\ninstrumental tracks comes<br />\ntogether like a polyrhythmic<br />\npuzzle\u2014drums, percussion, bass,<br />\nfirst guitar, and second guitar<br />\neach follow their own path, converging in sly juxtapositions of<br />\ntexture. Heard separately, the<br />\nparts seem repetitive and lifeless;<br />\ncombined, they lock neatly into<br />\nplace and grind out amazing<br />\nbursts of energy.<br />\nSome tracks are downright<br />\nrowdy. The Feelies' signature is<br />\nincessant rhythm, however complex, and once started, the pieces<br />\nrun like musical engines revving<br />\nin place. \"Too Much\" and<br />\n\"Higher Ground\" offer surprising grace; one marvels at the<br />\nperfection of their rhythmic<br />\nmovement. \"For Awhile\" and<br />\n\"Too Far Gone\" are rollicking<br />\nduels between bassist Brenda<br />\nSauter and drummer Dave<br />\nWeckerman. Mercer and Million<br />\nsculpture minute musical figures<br />\nin the air, relenting only in their<br />\nbrief, stately solos.<br />\nWhere most pop bands swamp<br />\ntheir songs in a glaze of effects,<br />\nthe Feelies break song structures<br />\ndown to their rhythmical bones,<br />\nfiltering themes and music alike<br />\ninto their own language. The process is akin to a musical sieve: the<br />\nband takes a composition, shakes<br />\naway the trimmings and fat, and<br /><br />\nWIT<br />\nWHILE IT'S HOT<br /><br />\nconstructs a performance from translating poetry from a foreign<br />\nthe sediment.

The<br />\nnarrator is Jim Holder, a conscientious objector who refuses<br />\n\"to kill anyone with a gun, or<br />\nwith anything except good intentions.\" Exempted from military<br />\nservice by the draft board in his<br />\nhometown of Malta, Indiana, he<br />\nsets out to perform alternative<br />\nservice at a large metropolitan<br />\nhospital in Chicago where he<br />\nfinds more death and bloodshed<br />\nthan he could have imagined.<br />\nSo begins Saigon, Illinois, a<br />\nfirst novel by Chicago native Paul<br />\nHoover.<br />\nThe novel follows Holder on<br />\nhis daily rounds as a unit manager<br />\nin the hospital. On his first working day, a patient has a cardiac arrest. Holder helps out in the effort to save him, but to no avail.<br />\nAfter the death, he takes the patient's body to the morgue and<br />\ngathers up his belongings to give<br />\nback to the family.<br />\nMany more patients die during<br />\nHolder's tenure at the hospital,<br />\nincluding Jack Triplet, a<br />\nquadriplegic who had kept a<br />\npistol by his bedside despite his<br />\ninability to use it. Holder finds<br />\nhimself picking up the belongings<br />\nof his former friend:<br />\n\"It was always harder to take<br />\nthe body to the morgue and collect the valuables when I knew the<br />\nperson. Standing next to his<br />\nbody, listing the pairs of socks<br /><br />\nand searching for the second<br />\nshoe, I half expected Jack to sit<br />\nup and talk to me.\"<br />\nLife after hours is no less<br />\ntumultuous for Holder. His<br />\nChicago roommates include a<br />\nrevolutionary wheeler-dealer, a<br />\nrich-boy Troskyite, and a speedfreak poet. With these and other<br />\ncharacters he embroils himself in<br />\nthe violence and tumult that is late<br />\n1960's Chicago. But while many<br />\nof his acquaintances resort to<br />\ndrastic measures in order to take<br />\ncontrol of their lives and to define<br />\nthemselves against the system,<br />\nHolder refuses to make any commitments. He participates in an<br />\nanti-war demonstration, but attempts to escape when the police<br />\narrive.<br />\nHolder's reluctance to protest<br />\nis a pervasive theme throughout<br />\nthe book. This is illustrated most<br />\nclearly when his girlfriend gets<br />\npregnant. He tells her that he does<br />\nnot want to commit himself to<br />\nmarriage or child rearing, but in<br />\nthe end, he forces her to have an<br />\nabortion. His stance is enough to<br />\nconvince her to go ahead with the<br />\nabortion, something she is morally opposed to. Since Holder is unwilling to make a commitment to<br />\nhis girlfriend, the reader assumes<br />\nthat she feels her pregnancy is no<br />\nlonger legitimate. We assume this<br />\nwithout direct explication on the<br />\nnarrator's part.<br />\nThe author prefers not to state<br />\nhis ideas clearly. In some parts,<br />\nlike the previous example, it is ef-<br /><br />\nfective, but this is an exception.<br />\nHolder does not explicitly state<br />\nwhat his reactions are to the<br />\ndeaths that occur in the hospital<br />\nwhere he works until halfway into the novel.<br />\n\"Even though I'd become<br />\nhardened to these scenes of death,<br />\nI felt like I'd been punched in the<br />\nstomach.\"<br />\nThis is his reaction to the death,<br />\nby leukemia, of a five-year old<br />\nboy. While this is a believable<br />\nreaction in itself, it does not<br />\nreveal much else to the reader<br />\nbesides a simple gut reaction.<br />\nIn the pages before this scene,<br />\nthere is hardly any reaction on the<br />\npart of the narrator to the blur of<br />\nhospital tragedies that are<br />\ndescribed in deadpan, slightly<br />\nironic language. Where these<br />\nreactions occur in the second half<br />\nof the book, they are very effective, as are the scenes of hospital<br />\nlife and streetside Chicago turmoil are quite remarkable. But<br />\nthe narration is inconsistent<br />\nbecause we are not given enough<br />\ninsights into the narrator's<br />\npersonality.<br />\nDespite this flaw, the main<br />\ntheme of the book is relatively<br />\nclear. Holder must find a way to<br />\nreconcile his actions with his nonviolent religious beliefs, although<br />\nwe are never told how strong they<br />\nare. He becomes convinced,<br />\nslowly, that there is only one true<br />\ncourse of action. His C.O. status<br />\nis not an act of resistance, it is<br />\nmerely a concession. He must<br /><br />\nPersonal *Touch Laundry Service<br /><br />\nP<br /><br />\nSAIGON,<br />\nILLINOIS<br /><br />\nT AGE<br />\nVIN<br />\nCONTEMPORARIES<br /><br />\nmake a hard choice; he can either<br />\nconcede to the system or resist by<br />\ngoing to jail. The conflict is clear,<br />\nbut the outcome is not what we<br />\nexpect and he never really does<br />\nmake the decision. In fact, he<br />\nresigns himself into letting fate<br />\nmake the decision for him.<br />\nFlaws aside, the narrator has a<br /><br />\nP<br />\nII P 1<br />\nscral4h-and SNIFF NOTES on<br /><br />\nsympathetic, unpretentious, and<br />\nwitty voice.

The Blue Jays blew an<br />\neight-point halftime lead and<br />\nwere out-rebounded 51-24 by the<br />\nYellow Jackets, who remained<br />\nunbeaten by improving their<br />\nrecord to 4-0. Hopkins dropped<br />\nto 2-2.<br />\nThe Blue Jays took control early in the game with some excellent outside shooting. Jedan<br />\nPhillips, the senior co-captain,<br />\ncame out on fire, connecting for<br />\neight points in the first seven<br />\nminutes of the game. Phillips,<br />\nhowever, had to be taken out of<br />\nthe game with 12:32 left to play<br />\nin the first half when he picked<br />\nup two fouls while guarding<br />\nJonathan Jones, Rochester's prolific scorer. Andy Enfield quickly picked up where Phillips left<br />\noff, and his third three-pointer of<br />\nthe game gave Hopkins a ten<br />\npoint lead with eight minutes remaining in the half. Enfield had<br />\nsixteen points and four three<br />\npointers in the first twenty<br />\nminutes, as the Jays took a 44-37<br />\nlead into the locker room at half<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe Yellow Jackets stormed<br />\nback at the beginning of the second half, as their dominance of<br />\nthe boards finally began to pay<br />\noff. Jones, who was averaging<br />\n30.7 points per game coming into Wednesday's match-up, finally began to connect as Rochester<br />\ngrabbed a 62-56 lead with 10:46<br />\nleft in the game.<br />\nJedan Phillips, however, once<br />\nagain sparked the Hopkins offense and put the Blue Jays right<br />\nback in the game. Phillips converted two key three-point plays<br /><br />\nby driving to the hoop and drawing the foul, and his beautiful<br />\nscoop shot gave Hopkins a 71-70<br />\nlead with two minutes to play.<br />\nPhillips led all scorers with<br />\ntwenty-four points by hitting<br />\n11-15 from the floor.<br />\nRochester regained a three<br />\npoint lead with just under a<br />\nminute left after two key turnovers by the Blue Jays. With<br />\nHopkins trailing 74-71, Phillips<br />\nwent to the line with twenty<br />\nseconds remaining. However, he<br />\nmissed both free throws, and the<br />\nYellow Jackets' Dave Reilly sealed the Rochester victory by connecting twice from the charity<br />\nstripe to make the final score<br />\n76-71.<br />\nIn the season opener, Hopkins<br />\neasily defeated the University of<br />\nChicago 93-73 in front of a nearcapacity crowd at the Newton<br />\nWhite Athletic Center. As in the<br />\nRochester game, Phillips provided the initial scoring spark for the<br />\nBlue Jays, hitting five of six shots<br />\nfrom the floor and finishing with<br />\ntwelve points. Joel Siepiereski<br />\ntook advantage of the weak inside<br />\nplay of the Maroons, as he banged the offensive boards and<br />\nscored twenty-one points.<br />\nSiepiereski, who even ventured<br />\nout to hit a three-pointer,<br />\ndemonstrated why he had the<br />\nsecond-best shooting record in the<br />\nMAC last year by going 10-11<br />\nfrom the field.

The<br />\nMaroons seemed to key on Enfield, trying to deny him the ball<br />\nand keep him from connecting<br />\nfrom the outside. Enfield,<br />\nhowever, responded by merely<br />\ndriving to the basket and drawing<br />\nthe foul. He went 14-14 from the<br />\nfree throw line, where he had the<br />\nfourth best shooting percentage in<br /><br />\nDivision III last season, and<br />\nscored nineteen points.

After<br />\nHopkins tied the score at 78-78<br />\nwith only seventeen seconds remaining, Catholic was able to get<br />\noff three shots, the last of which<br />\nwent in at the buzzer to give the<br />\nCardinals a 80-78 victory.

Goodyear is faced<br />\nwith a rebuilding season.<br />\nGoodyear lost half of last year's<br />\nteam, including four of the top<br />\nfive players, to graduation. This<br />\nyear's squad unquestionably has<br />\nexcellent athletes, but this is one<br />\nof the first years in recent<br />\nmemory when no one on the team<br />\nhas had any experience playing<br />\nbefore<br />\nsquash<br />\ncoming<br />\nto Hopkins. This year, Coach<br />\nGoodyear must rely on the core<br />\nof remaining veterans for leadership and rebuild by recruiting<br />\nfreshmen athletes with experience<br />\nin other sports.<br />\nThe difficulties the team faces<br />\nwere evident on Sunday,<br />\nNovember 20th, when the Jays<br />\nlost to Cornell 1-9 and to Penn<br />\n0-9 at the University of Pennsylvania. In the match against<br />\nDivision III Cornell, the sole<br />\nHopkins winner was 9th-ranked<br />\nfreshman Michelle Steindecker,<br />\nwho won her match by scores of<br />\n15-9, 17-15, 16-17, 15-11.<br />\nSeniors Kathy Hart and Alice<br />\nCollins, playing at number one<br />\nand two respectively, both lost<br />\n3-0. Senior captain Chris Emmick battled to a 1-3 loss while<br />\njuniors Kathryn Ng and Laura<br />\nGaffney both lost in three<br />\nstraight. Sixth-seeded freshman<br />\nTara Dorr lost 15-12, 15-9, 15-11<br />\nand fellow freshman Karran<br />\nPhillips lost 16-4, 15-8, 15-9.<br />\nSophomore Dawn Stoner fell<br />\n15-9, 15-4, 15-6.<br />\nIn a tough match versus Division II Penn, all of the Jays lost<br />\n3-0. Although Hopkins played<br />\nsome good points, they were not<br />\nconsistent enough throughout, but<br />\nmany players felt that they had<br />\nplayed better in this match than<br /><br />\nin the one against Cornell.<br />\nLess than two hours after these<br />\nfound<br />\nHopkins<br />\ndefeats,<br />\nthemselves facing Haverford, a<br />\nweak team that Hopkins usually<br />\ndominates.<br />\nLast year the Blue Jays blanked the Red Wave three times.<br />\nThis year, Haverford has vowed<br />\nto fight their way out of the intercollegiate squash cellar.<br />\nNevertheless, despite their fatigue<br />\nand their earlier defeats, Hopkins<br />\nprevailed 8-1. Hart lost a close<br />\n1-3 match as teammate Collins<br />\ncame back from a 0-2 deficit and<br />\noutlasted her opponent 7-15,<br />\n10-15, 15-9, 16-15, 16-14. With<br />\nthe bulk of Haverford's strength<br />\nconcentrated in their top two<br />\nplayers, the rest of the matches<br />\nwent considerably smoother for<br />\nHopkins: Emmick won 16-13,<br />\n15-4,15-1, Ng won 15-9, 15-8,<br />\n17-14, and Gaffney won 15-7,<br />\n15-9, 18-17. The rookies had<br />\nseveral impressive wins. Dorr<br />\nslammed her opponent 15-3,<br />\n15-0, 15-2; Phillips rolled 15-2,<br />\n15-2, 15-6; and Stoner crushed<br />\nher foe with a 15-5, 15-5, 15-2<br />\nwin. Steindecker won 15-6, 15-7,<br />\n15-8 and senior Laura Harwook<br />\nwon 15-6, 15-2, 15-7.<br />\nDespite an uneven performance<br />\nin their first outing. Hopkins's<br />\nfuture looks bright. Coach<br />\nGoodyear is especially pleased<br />\nwith the showing of his rookies,<br />\nwho demonstrated good skills in<br />\ntheir first matches. It's still early<br />\nin the season, and as Hopkins<br />\nbecomes used to competition,<br />\nthey will only improve. Tomorrow the squad flies up to Connecticut to play all weekend in the<br />\nWesleyan Tournament, which<br />\nwill close out the fall portion of<br />\nthe season.<br /><br />\n811-5NNU4WW<br /><br />\n*******************<br /><br />\nWelcome Back!!<br /><br />\nJHU<br /><br />\nGuaranteed<br />\nLowest<br />\nFares!!<br />\nALL<br />\n\"SERVICES\"<br />\nARE ABSOLUTELY<br />\nFREE, QUICK*<br />\nCONVENIENT<br />\n'We're Right in Your Backyard'<br /><br />\n467-9300<br />\n:/ Amedcon<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSodety<br />\nofTravel Agents<br /><br />\nLocated In The Rotunda Man<br />\nUp the Ramp From the Giant<br />\nflake the Shuttle or Just Call)<br /><br />\nSewing Baltimore &amp; JHU Since 1982<br />\nVb1.111.<br /><br />\n\u2022Air Tickets.<br />\n\u2022Amtrak\u2022<br />\n*Packages.<br />\n\u2022Cruises\u2022<br />\n\u2022Tours\u2022<br />\n\u2022Free V.I.P.

Jake \"The Snake\" Menella<br />\novercame a 6-0 deficit in the consolation finals to place third for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAsked about the team's performance, Rosenzweig said, \"I<br />\nthink we did well today.

The<br />\ngame provided a great defensive<br />\nbattle, several physical confrontations, and as a result, a good<br />\ndeal of open-ice hockey.<br />\nThe Jays scored very early in<br />\nthe first period as they<br />\ndemonstrated effective forechecking. Pat Gibbons initiated the<br />\nscoring effort after winning the<br />\nopening face-off and dumping the<br />\npuck in around the boards. A<br />\nWestern Maryland defenseman<br />\nthen intercepted the puck only to<br />\nget checked by right winger Bill<br />\nMarquardt behind the net. Jay<br />\nCawkins then picked up the loose<br />\npuck and passed it back to Mike<br />\nHolmes, who rifled a slapshot<br />\nfrom the point. Although Western<br />\nMaryland's goalie made the save,<br />\nMarquardt was perfectly positioned for the rebound and made<br />\nno mistake finding an opening on<br />\nthe right side of the net.<br />\nFor the rest of the first period,<br />\nthe game was filled with penalties<br />\nranging fom too many men on the<br />\nice to fighting. Mark Koren firmly established the mood of the<br />\ngame as he and a Western<br />\nMarylander both received game<br />\nmisconducts for fighting. Later<br />\non in the first period, the referee<br />\nmade a very questionable call on<br />\nPat Gibbons. Gibbons, after picking up the puck around center ice,<br />\nskated inside the opponents' blue<br /><br />\nline. He put a move on the<br />\ndefenseman and then took a shot.<br />\nWestern Maryland's goalie left<br />\nthe crease and knocked Gibbons<br />\ndown, prompting the referee to<br />\nblow the whistle. After Gibbons<br />\ngot up, he saw the goalie charging towards him and pushed him<br />\nback in self-defense. Gibbons was<br />\nsubsequently jumped from behind<br />\nby a Western Maryland player,<br />\nand not wanting to retaliate, Gibbons lowered himself to the ice to<br />\navoid a penalty. The opposing<br />\nplayer then proceeded to pummel<br />\nGibbons in the back while the<br />\nreferee and linesman simply<br />\nlooked on, making no attempt to<br />\nbreak up the lopsided brawl.<br />\nEventually, the hostile encounter<br />\nended with both players getting<br />\nthrown out of the game. Although<br />\nHopkins coach Steve Wirth loudly protested the decision, Gibbons<br />\nwas forced to leave.
