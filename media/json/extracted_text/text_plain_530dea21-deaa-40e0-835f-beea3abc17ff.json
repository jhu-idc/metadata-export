In the finest<br />\nfootball game a Blue Jay team<br />\nhas played in at least four years,<br />\nHopkins moved the ball<br />\nimpressively while containing the<br />\nvaunted Towson machine<br />\nthrough most of the game.<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jay defense was<br />\nparticularly inspired in the<br />\nopening minutes of the game,<br />\nwhen the tone for the afternoon<br />\nwas set. The defenders forced<br />\nthree Tiger fumbles in their first<br />\nsix plays, with Bruce Parker and<br />\nRon Hall each recovering the<br />\ngreased pigskin once. Both times<br />\nthe Blue Jays capitalized swiftly<br />\nto take an impressive 13-0 lead<br />\nby the 10:16 mark of the first<br />\nperiod.<br />\nSenior quarterback Jack<br />\n<br />\nScott Smith (87) pass for first down in third period<br />\n<br />\nPaws-turret<br />\n<br />\nThomas connected on four<br />\nstraight passes in the first drive<br />\nand then plunged into paydirt<br />\nfrom the one with the<br />\nice-breakers. The second time<br />\nTowson coughed up the ball,<br />\nsophomore Ted Stefaniw lost no<br />\ntime converting the break. He<br />\ntook a draw play all the way for<br />\na 31 yard touchdown jaunt down<br />\nthe left sideline.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nConsidered two touchdown<br />\nfavorites by some observers,<br />\nTowson was unable to find the<br />\nanswer against the fired up<br />\nHopkins eleven. Thomas led the<br />\nteam to four scores in their first<br />\nsix possessions, while the Blue<br />\nJays shut out the Tigers, 23-0, in<br />\nthe first half, the first time<br />\nTowson has been held scoreless<br />\nfor thirty minutes all season.<br />\n\"To win the game we knew we<br />\nwould have to control the ball,\"<br />\nexplained an elated Coach Cox<br />\nafter the victory. \"Larry Jones<br />\nwas going to get hit one hundred<br />\nyards, but Dan DuIlea could not<br />\nbe allowed to throw.- Jones did<br />\nget 142 yards and the new<br />\nTowson season rushing record,<br />\nbut the Blue Jays sacked Dullea<br />\nsix times and never let him<br />\nmount a real passing threat.<br />\nMeanwhile, Thomas was<br />\npassing up a storm, connecting<br />\non eighteen of twenty-five for<br />\n249 yards. The return of Harry<br />\nStringer added immeasurably to<br />\nthe Blue Jay air attack, as he and<br />\nBill Nolan presented a double<br />\nthreat to the right side of the<br />\nTowson zone defense. Stringer<br />\ntook in four for 49 yards while<br />\n\"the Gnat\" hauled in eight<br />\nothers.<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nRooters 1-0 victors over UMBC<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nsoccer team put itself over the<br />\n.500 mark last Saturday as it shut<br />\nout UMBC by a score of 1-0. The<br />\nscore showed the closeness and<br />\ntenseness which was seen<br />\nthroughout the game by a<br />\ncapacity Parents Day crowd.<br />\nWhat the score didn't show was<br />\nthe hundred -fold Blue Jay<br />\nimprovement that was apparent<br />\nsince their past few contests.<br />\nAs the game began, the Jays<br />\nfound their acceleration to be a<br />\nbit slow. The ball seemed to<br />\nremain on the Hopkins' defensive<br />\nside of the field for a majority of<br />\nthe first twenty minutes. All Blue<br />\nJay offensive efforts were<br />\nquickly brought under control by<br />\nthe UMBC defense, which was<br />\nobviously outhustling the<br />\nHopkins booters. Loose balls saw.<br />\nvery little, if any, blue around<br />\nthem as Hopkins' opponents<br />\nswarmed around every<br />\nopportunity to get the ball.<br />\nThen the tide began to turn as<br />\nthe Blue Jays began to pick up<br />\n<br />\nthe tempo of the game. The Jays<br />\nbegan to break down field on a<br />\nnumber of occasions, many of<br />\nthese drives ending in missed<br />\nshots. Occasionally Hopkins<br />\nwould pump a few shots at the<br />\nUMBC goalie; in one instance,<br />\nsenior Frank \"one goal\" Curnoles<br />\nput a hard shot into the left pipe<br />\nof the goal with the diving UMBC<br />\ngoalie just fingertipping the ball<br />\nout of bounds.<br />\nAs the game progressed, the<br />\nBlue Jays' use of their skills<br />\nimproved. Their passing game<br />\nwas by far one of their best of<br />\ntheir season. Highlighting their<br />\npassing game was the only goal of<br />\nthe day, which started on an<br />\nexcellently pivotted ball that<br />\nCumoles sent down the right<br />\nwing to senior co-captain Phil<br />\nHieter. Hieter dribbled down to<br />\nhis corner position after eluding<br />\nhis defensiveman and crossed the<br />\nball to the awaiting head of Bert<br />\nArguero in front of the goal<br />\nmouth. Arguero promptly<br />\nheaded the ball away from the<br />\noutstretched arms of the UMBC<br />\n<br />\ngoalie and into the net. To the<br />\nspectators, this goal looked like it<br />\ncame directly from a soccer<br />\ntextbook. Even the players<br />\nagreed that the workings of the<br />\nplay were perfect. The Blue Jays<br />\nare capable of this kind of play<br />\nand many more 'plays like it.<br />\nAfter this goal came in the first<br />\nhalf, neither team scored for the<br />\nremainder of the game. The Jays<br />\nnever let up as they continued to<br />\ndrive UMBC back to their<br />\ndefensive side. UMBC's biggest<br />\ndrive was stopped by Hopkins<br />\ngoalie, senior co-captain Keith<br />\n\"Nuts\" Naunheim. Naunheim,<br />\ndemonstrating some unknown<br />\nbasketball abilities, deflected a<br />\nhard shot aimed toward the<br />\nupper left comer of the net.<br />\nNaunheim, fighting his way<br />\nthrough a UMBC offesnive<br />\ncrowd, jumped up and<br />\nintercepted the shot and tipped it<br />\nbehind the net.<br />\nThis Saturday the Jays will<br />\ntravel to Washington College in<br />\nhopes of acting as.a \"spoiler\" in<br />\nthat MAC game.<br />\n<br />\nMark Hetherington (77) moves in for the sack<br />\nLast week Nolan broke the<br />\nyard mark, busting the 2971<br />\nHopkins career record with his<br />\ntotal established by Jim Feely<br />\nfifteenth touchdown pass, and<br />\nfrom 1966 to 1.068.

Savitz said last week<br />\nthat the next area of SC concentration is to be on academic<br />\nmatters, and there is no doubt that the Council will find plenty<br />\nto work on there.<br />\nAlthough there are many academic problems the SC could<br />\ntry to tackle in the next few weeks, the most important onces<br />\ncertainly are the matter of freshman pass-fail grading and the<br />\npostponement of the add-drop date for all students. While the<br />\nCouncil has no authority in either of these matters, its force as a<br />\nrepresentative body of students here would not go unnoticed by<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate Studies at its next meeting<br />\nThursday when it is scheduled to reconsider its decision to<br />\nmodify the University's stand on the freshman pass-fail grading,<br />\nor at its meeting in December, when it is to consider the<br />\nproposed change of the final add-drop date.<br />\nCommittees like the CUS and the Academic Council have<br />\nshown in the past that they will at least listen to carefully<br />\nconsidered student opinion if it is presented, but they will not<br />\nusually bother to seek out such input. Regrettably, while the SC<br />\nwas squandering seven weeks of its meetings debating the<br />\ncomposition of the disciplinary hearing board that few<br />\nundergraduates will ever face, the CUS was busy abandoning its<br />\ncommittment to the 1500 Hopkins students affected by the<br />\nchange in the pass-fail policy. Very likely, the CUS will not<br />\noverturn its earlier vote on the matter, but the SC, as the only<br />\ngroup around here that represents all undergraduates, should<br />\ncertainly go on record calling for such an overturn and make<br />\nclear that such expediency as the CUS showed on the grading<br />\nissue will not again go unchallenged.<br /><br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nWe, as co-chairmen of the MSE<br />\nSymposium would like to<br />\napologize to the group named the<br />\nStudents to Impeach Nixon (SIN).<br />\nPrior to the arrival of Senator<br />\nPercy, we had consented to let this<br />\ngroup give their views in a written<br />\npresentation during the question<br />\nperiod.

In the finest<br />\nfootball game a Blue Jay team<br />\nhas played in at least four years,<br />\nHopkins moved the ball<br />\nimpressively while containing the<br />\nvaunted Towson machine<br />\nthrough most of the game.<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jay defense was<br />\nparticularly inspired in the<br />\nopening minutes of the game,<br />\nwhen the tone for the afternoon<br />\nwas set. The defenders forced<br />\nthree Tiger fumbles in their first<br />\nsix plays, with Bruce Parker and<br />\nRon Hall each recovering the<br />\ngreased pigskin once. Both times<br />\nthe Blue Jays capitalized swiftly<br />\nto take an impressive 13-0 lead<br />\nby the 10:16 mark of the first<br />\nperiod.<br />\nSenior quarterback Jack<br /><br />\nScott Smith (87) pass for first down in third period<br /><br />\nPaws-turret<br /><br />\nThomas connected on four<br />\nstraight passes in the first drive<br />\nand then plunged into paydirt<br />\nfrom the one with the<br />\nice-breakers. The second time<br />\nTowson coughed up the ball,<br />\nsophomore Ted Stefaniw lost no<br />\ntime converting the break. He<br />\ntook a draw play all the way for<br />\na 31 yard touchdown jaunt down<br />\nthe left sideline.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nConsidered two touchdown<br />\nfavorites by some observers,<br />\nTowson was unable to find the<br />\nanswer against the fired up<br />\nHopkins eleven. Thomas led the<br />\nteam to four scores in their first<br />\nsix possessions, while the Blue<br />\nJays shut out the Tigers, 23-0, in<br />\nthe first half, the first time<br />\nTowson has been held scoreless<br />\nfor thirty minutes all season.<br />\n\"To win the game we knew we<br />\nwould have to control the ball,\"<br />\nexplained an elated Coach Cox<br />\nafter the victory. \"Larry Jones<br />\nwas going to get hit one hundred<br />\nyards, but Dan DuIlea could not<br />\nbe allowed to throw.- Jones did<br />\nget 142 yards and the new<br />\nTowson season rushing record,<br />\nbut the Blue Jays sacked Dullea<br />\nsix times and never let him<br />\nmount a real passing threat.<br />\nMeanwhile, Thomas was<br />\npassing up a storm, connecting<br />\non eighteen of twenty-five for<br />\n249 yards. The return of Harry<br />\nStringer added immeasurably to<br />\nthe Blue Jay air attack, as he and<br />\nBill Nolan presented a double<br />\nthreat to the right side of the<br />\nTowson zone defense. Stringer<br />\ntook in four for 49 yards while<br />\n\"the Gnat\" hauled in eight<br />\nothers.<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nRooters 1-0 victors over UMBC<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nsoccer team put itself over the<br />\n.500 mark last Saturday as it shut<br />\nout UMBC by a score of 1-0. The<br />\nscore showed the closeness and<br />\ntenseness which was seen<br />\nthroughout the game by a<br />\ncapacity Parents Day crowd.<br />\nWhat the score didn't show was<br />\nthe hundred -fold Blue Jay<br />\nimprovement that was apparent<br />\nsince their past few contests.<br />\nAs the game began, the Jays<br />\nfound their acceleration to be a<br />\nbit slow. The ball seemed to<br />\nremain on the Hopkins' defensive<br />\nside of the field for a majority of<br />\nthe first twenty minutes. All Blue<br />\nJay offensive efforts were<br />\nquickly brought under control by<br />\nthe UMBC defense, which was<br />\nobviously outhustling the<br />\nHopkins booters. Loose balls saw.<br />\nvery little, if any, blue around<br />\nthem as Hopkins' opponents<br />\nswarmed around every<br />\nopportunity to get the ball.<br />\nThen the tide began to turn as<br />\nthe Blue Jays began to pick up<br /><br />\nthe tempo of the game. The Jays<br />\nbegan to break down field on a<br />\nnumber of occasions, many of<br />\nthese drives ending in missed<br />\nshots. Occasionally Hopkins<br />\nwould pump a few shots at the<br />\nUMBC goalie; in one instance,<br />\nsenior Frank \"one goal\" Curnoles<br />\nput a hard shot into the left pipe<br />\nof the goal with the diving UMBC<br />\ngoalie just fingertipping the ball<br />\nout of bounds.<br />\nAs the game progressed, the<br />\nBlue Jays' use of their skills<br />\nimproved. Their passing game<br />\nwas by far one of their best of<br />\ntheir season. Highlighting their<br />\npassing game was the only goal of<br />\nthe day, which started on an<br />\nexcellently pivotted ball that<br />\nCumoles sent down the right<br />\nwing to senior co-captain Phil<br />\nHieter. Hieter dribbled down to<br />\nhis corner position after eluding<br />\nhis defensiveman and crossed the<br />\nball to the awaiting head of Bert<br />\nArguero in front of the goal<br />\nmouth. Arguero promptly<br />\nheaded the ball away from the<br />\noutstretched arms of the UMBC<br /><br />\ngoalie and into the net. To the<br />\nspectators, this goal looked like it<br />\ncame directly from a soccer<br />\ntextbook. Even the players<br />\nagreed that the workings of the<br />\nplay were perfect. The Blue Jays<br />\nare capable of this kind of play<br />\nand many more 'plays like it.<br />\nAfter this goal came in the first<br />\nhalf, neither team scored for the<br />\nremainder of the game. The Jays<br />\nnever let up as they continued to<br />\ndrive UMBC back to their<br />\ndefensive side. UMBC's biggest<br />\ndrive was stopped by Hopkins<br />\ngoalie, senior co-captain Keith<br />\n\"Nuts\" Naunheim. Naunheim,<br />\ndemonstrating some unknown<br />\nbasketball abilities, deflected a<br />\nhard shot aimed toward the<br />\nupper left comer of the net.<br />\nNaunheim, fighting his way<br />\nthrough a UMBC offesnive<br />\ncrowd, jumped up and<br />\nintercepted the shot and tipped it<br />\nbehind the net.<br />\nThis Saturday the Jays will<br />\ntravel to Washington College in<br />\nhopes of acting as.a \"spoiler\" in<br />\nthat MAC game.<br /><br />\nMark Hetherington (77) moves in for the sack<br />\nLast week Nolan broke the<br />\nyard mark, busting the 2971<br />\nHopkins career record with his<br />\ntotal established by Jim Feely<br />\nfifteenth touchdown pass, and<br />\nfrom 1966 to 1.068.
