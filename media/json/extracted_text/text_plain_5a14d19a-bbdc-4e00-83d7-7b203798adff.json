After all, it is rather difficult to get<br />\nworked up about a \"problem\" which<br />\nresults in each of us getting increasingly<br />\nhigher and higher grades for the same<br />\namount of work. What must be realized,<br />\nhowever, is that the 'A' we earn today<br />\nmeans much less than the same mark would<br />\nhave a dozen years ago. Frequently, an 'A'<br />\nnow means nothing beyond the fact<br />\nthat all the work for a particular class was<br />\nturned in on time with a minimum of<br />\nspelling errors. In other words, it denotes<br />\ncompetency instead of quality. When any<br />\nempty helmet can capture a 'C' merely by<br />\nshowing up for class and a 'B' by raising his<br />\nhand occasionally, then an 'A' has to cover<br />\neverything above such a level, which<br />\nconstitutes an extraordinary amount of territory. The 'A' has become so broad as to<br />\nbe meaningless.<br />\nGrade inflation also works in the<br />\nopposite direction. When an 'A' is perceived as the only \"acceptable\" grade, with<br />\neverything below it merely denoting<br />\nvarying degrees of failure, then pressure<br />\nbecomes intense. In classes where a curve is<br />\nemployed, or where grade inflation has not<br />\nrun rampant (such as the basic pre-med<br />\ncourses), the wild scramble for an 'A'<br />\nat any price is debilitating and often<br />\nunethical.<br />\n<br />\nThis is a strange contradiction: a<br />\ngrade which no longer means anything<br />\nsignificant, and yet which must be persued<br />\nwith ever-increasing effort. 'A' is the most<br />\nfrequently given grade at Hopkins, yet the<br />\nstudents are suffering because of it.<br />\nThere is no panacea for this unfortunate situation, but there is something<br />\nwhich could help significantly. If the new<br />\nplus/minus grading system is introduced, it<br />\ncould prove to be a partial answer to the<br />\nproblems of runaway grade inflation. By,<br />\nin effect, dividing the `A'ituto two grades<br />\nand the 'IV and 'C' into three, it will create<br />\na grading system sensitive enough to<br />\nseparate the wheat from the chaff. No<br />\nlonger will professors be faced with giving<br />\nstudents either \"the 'A' or the Abyss,\" and<br />\nthe space-filler will be differentiated from<br />\nthe scholar. The faculty has no hidden<br />\nmotive for proposing the change, being,<br />\nprompted by simple concern for the<br />\nstudents and for the quality of education at<br />\nHopkins. If we are motivated by similar<br />\nconcerns, then we should give the proposal<br />\nour firm support. Grades are taken seriously by the outside world, and should therefore be as meaningful and rational as we<br />\ncan possibly make them. The plus/minus<br />\nsystem will do just that, and diminish a<br />\nlittle of Hopkins' notorious cut-throat<br />\ncompetition in the bargain.<br />\n<br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\nPeter Choo<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nAnne McElwee<br />\n<br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nToots Naim<br />\nPhilip Schutzer<br />\nProduction Staff<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editor<br />\n<br />\nTom Schiller<br />\nJim Sidbury<br />\nMarian Tamburrino<br />\n<br />\nJeff Adelman<br />\nChris Hurley<br />\nDeborah Jones<br />\nP.J.

Doves disappear. 'Yes,' says<br />\nhawkish Senator Henry Jackson, 'a year ago I<br />\ntold the Russians that Salt II was dead. Remember,' he drops his voice, 'that if war<br />\ncomes, it won't be conventional this time; it will<br />\nbe nuclear.' We glance at each other, chilled -- a<br />\ngroup of about 30 hard-boiled reporters. Mr.<br />\nJackson seems almost exultant.\"<br />\nThe same thing is happening across the<br />\nUnited States. The nation seems to be hot for a<br />\nwar. Last week at a television press conference,<br />\nSenator Alan Cranston of California practically<br />\nbounced in his chair with elation over America's<br />\nnew fervor. Cranston fairly foamed at the mouth<br />\nlike a man who has just snapped out of long<br />\nperiod of impotence. The usually liberal senator<br />\nfrom California, like countless politicians,<br />\ncolumnists, and editorial writers, has already<br />\ndubbed this prodigious conflict-to-be \"World<br />\nWar III.\" The Big Big One.<br />\nPerhaps people feel so good about being<br />\nup in arms because it's a posture that has faded<br />\nalong with the American economy, military, and<br />\npsyche. By becoming combative, we presumably restore that posture and at the same time<br />\nvent all the frustrations of the past 15-odd years.<br />\nIn last Friday's Baltimore Sun, a Tom Flannery<br />\ncartoon depicted the Congress in thunderous<br />\napplause as President Carter stands in his<br />\nnew-fashioned cowboy outfit, complete with<br />\nStetson and six-shooters. John Wayne lives.<br />\nLast week, the president announced his<br />\nnew budget, which includes a substantial increase in military expenditures. The hardliners<br />\nbreathe a sign of relief. A strong defense is<br />\na must, but our current problems in the Middle<br />\nEast warrant not so much a beefed-up military<br />\nas a specific energy program. Every American<br />\npresident since Franklin Roosevelt has asked<br />\nCongress to come up with such a program but<br />\nnone yet exists. President Carter has always<br />\nsaid that the U.S. would not think twice about<br />\nfighting for control of the Persian Gulf, or more<br />\nspecifically, for its oil supply. If that is indeed<br />\nthe only reason we look on anxiously to the<br />\neast, then the U.S. would be wise to devote its<br />\nhuman and economic resources to devising ways<br />\nto met our energy needs, rather than to a war.<br />\nCertain factions say, \"America desperately needs that Arab crude, so we have no choice<br />\nbut to go in and fight for it.\" But what exactly<br />\nwould we be getting? In a few years, the United<br />\nStates will be spending nearly half of its productive<br />\ncapacity on OPEC oil. An absurd price;to say the<br />\nleast. By deepening our dependence on Middle<br />\nEast crude, by continuing without a concrete<br />\nenergy program, we will drive the U.S. economy,<br />\nand consequently the U.S. itself, into the<br />\nground. Wasting American lives in an oil war<br />\nwould only compound the tragedy. As Garry<br />\nWills points out, blood for oil is no bargain.<br />\nSome people don't see oil as the only<br />\nreason, or as any reason at all. The real reason,<br />\naccording to many hawks, is stopping -- or<br />\nstom in -- the Russians before the turn ever<br />\n<br />\nMiddle East nation into a branch office of the<br />\nKremlin. The president and whoever else is<br />\nformulating our policy have apparently not<br />\nlearned from the lessons of Vietnam.(What was<br />\nit that Santayana said about those who have not<br />\nstudied history?) Obviously, some of the Middle<br />\nEast leaders are quite upset because Mr. Carter<br />\nmade indirect threats to the Soviet Union on<br />\nbehalf of the universe and failed to ask any<br />\ncountry whether it wanted it our assistance in<br />\nthe first place. This week at the Pakistan<br />\nconference, the heads of 36 Islamic nations<br />\nshowed that at least for now they are willing to<br />\ndeal with Russia by themselves. The United<br />\nStates should not intervene, with either weapons<br />\nor advice, until.asked.<br />\nNow the registration and drafting of<br />\nyoung Americans is in the offing. The media<br />\nwould have us believe that these youths are as<br />\nstaunchly conservative as their parents. Locally,<br />\nChannel 11's Action News conducted \"random\"<br />\ninterviews last week with three Hopkins males<br />\nwho support a draft and war with the Russians,<br />\nand this week the station is running a series<br />\nwhich asserts that this country's young people<br />\nare \"very conservative .\" Maybe the majority of<br />\nthem are; it is nonetheless galling for one's<br />\ngeneration to be so casually pigeonholed (and<br />\nthus this article, which attempts to show that<br />\nnot everyone under 25 is marching to the same<br />\ndrummer).<br />\nDespite the hawkishness of so many<br />\nyoung Americans, I wonder how long that mood<br />\nwill last. By now they must have imagined, for<br />\ninstance, how it would feel to get zapped by<br />\none of those deadly gases that the Russians are<br />\nalready using in Afghanistan. Once such a<br />\nsobering thought and others like it sink in, will<br />\nthese young men and women remain so agreeable to conscription? As one Hopkins male<br />\ncandidly told me,\"The thought of going to war<br />\nand being in combat scares the living hell out of<br />\nme.\" (If the Seventies were The Me Decade,<br />\nthen the Eighties, at least in relation to the<br />\ndraft, could be The Not Me Decade.)<br />\nCongress won't decide on the draft until<br />\nthis May, at the earliest. American youths<br />\ntherefore have ample time to agonize over the<br />\npossiblity of their numbers coming up some<br />\nday. To that end, I recently asked some Hopkins<br />\nstudents how they felt about the draft, war,<br />\nPresident Carter, and other related matters. Of<br />\ncourse, this article is not intended as a representative sampling of the entire student body,<br />\nthough I have tried to maintain a balance of<br />\ndiffering opinions. My primary goal, in addition<br />\nto stating some of my.own ideas, was to give a<br />\ndozen students an opportunity to comment on a<br />\ndismayingly complex situation that affects them<br />\nsignificantly and in many cases, uncomfortably.<br />\nSandy,a senior, is of Japanese descent. At the<br />\nstart of World War II, both her parents were<br />\nincarcerated in a California prison camp for<br />\nJapanese-Americans. Anti-Japanese sentiment<br />\n.was running high in this country in the wake of<br />\n'the Pearl Harbor attack, and as might be expected, war is an es eciall un leasant to sic to<br />\n<br />\nSandy.<br />\n\"When I was fttle, all the kids in my<br />\nneighborhood would ask each other what<br />\nbranch of the service their fathers were in during<br />\nWorld War II,\" she recalls. \"I would be embarrassed by that question. I wouldn't know what<br />\nto say. I wasn't about to tell them that my<br />\nfather and my mother were both in a prisoner<br />\nof war camp.<br />\n\"The draft concerns me, not just because<br />\nit might affect me, but I have a brother of draft<br />\nage, too. If I were drafted, I wouldn't want to<br />\ngo, but I don't know if I have the energy to not<br />\ngo. If there's any legal way to avoid the draft,<br />\nthen I wouldn't go to war. But if I couldn't get<br />\naround it, then I suppose I would have to go.\"<br />\nOn the question of women and the draft,<br />\nSandy says, \"I think it's fair that women be<br />\nsubjected to selective service. I mean, if they<br />\nwant to gripe about getting equality for everything, then they should have to serve.\" She<br />\npaused, then laughed, \"It's fair, but I don't want<br />\n<br />\ntl<br />\n<br />\n!Hopkins students speak<br />\n<br />\nDraft: Pr<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nby Patrick<br />\n<br />\nto go!\"<br />\nDon, a senior History major, favors<br />\nreinstating the draft. Though he declined to say<br />\nwhether or not he would go to war, Don offered<br />\nan analysis of the current situation in Afghanistan.<br />\n\"The Russians have desired a warm -water<br />\nport for nearly 200 years. Their invasion of<br />\nAfghanistan puts them very close to that goal.<br />\nAn Indian Ocean naval base would also further<br />\nthe Soviet strategy of encircling Western oil<br />\nsupplies.<br />\n\"The Soviets invaded Afghanistan,\" Don<br />\ncontinues, \"because they felt that the U.S. w as<br />\npreoccupied with the crisis in Iran and could not<br />\nmount an effective response. As events have<br />\nproven, the Soviet assessment was true. While<br />\nthe U.S. regular army has shrunk, our dependence on nuclear weapons has grown proportionately. The Russians have more tanks, trucks,<br />\nand soldiers than the U.S. Consequently,<br />\nAmerica has to sit by as the Soviets grab off<br />\nchunks of Asia and Africa.\"<br />\nCiting the volunteer army as \"a proven<br />\nfailure,\" Don adds, \"If you look back through<br />\nhistory, one of the founding fathers' greatest<br />\nworries was a standing army. They knew from<br />\nhistory that a professional army tends to look<br />\nafter its own interests, and that those interests<br />\nmay not always be consistent with those of the<br />\npeople. A civilian army, representing varied<br />\npeople and interests, is the best way to insure<br />\nthat the military does not exercise undue<br />\ninfluence over the government. It's time we<br />\nre-instituted the peacetime draft as part of our<br />\nenergetic program to revitalize our conventional<br />\nforces.\"<br />\nAs a candidate for the position of Naval<br />\nAviation Reserve Officer, Bill, a senior, is<br />\nunaffected by a draft. In the event of war, he<br />\ncould be one of the first to be called to combat.<br />\nBill wonders whether conscripted soldiers, who<br />\noften see military duty as \"an interruption of<br />\ntheir personal lives,\" would serve with the<br />\nloyalty and intensity of trained soldiers.<br />\n\"But,\" he says, \"an army of citizen-soldiers, who have reliquished their personal<br />\n<br />\n\fendeavors to fight for a just'or truly threatening<br />\nnational cause, can become an effective military<br />\nand national instrument, as in the Civil War and<br />\nWorld War II. What needs to be implemented<br />\nbefore a general conscription is a clear delineation of what a conscripted armed force would be<br />\nfighting for.<br />\n\"This country is still great for a number<br />\nof reasons. Among these is our diversity of<br />\npersonal interests. This pluralistic society, with<br />\nour personal liberties maintained, is our greatest<br />\nstrength. I don't think we should destroy it by<br />\nforcing our youth into national service without a<br />\nreason to serve. Those of us in the armed forces<br />\nwill always proudly serve our country. America's youth must also serve, whether by service<br />\nto their communities, their families, or their<br />\nprofessions. And if necessary, they must serve<br />\nas soldiers.\"<br />\nDoes Bill think that the reinstatement of<br />\nthe draft is purely a political move on President<br />\nCarter's part? \"Well, let me just say this: Even if<br />\n<br />\nakout,<br />\n<br />\n'ro & Con<br />\nck Ercolano<br />\n<br />\n;<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\n;<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n-I did think that, I wouldn't say it publicly.

The next step seems to be the<br />\nbeginning of the draft, which I'm t,?posed to,<br />\nand then the only step left open would. seem to<br />\nbe the sending of troops.

If I am going to be<br />\nsent off to die in the name of freedom, it's not<br />\ngoing to be to prop up a Zia or a Khomeini.\"<br />\nUpon first hearing talk about the draft,<br />\nSam's immediate reaction was that he wouldn't<br />\ngo, no matter what. \"But after giving things a lot<br />\nof thought,\" he says, \"I think I might be willing<br />\nto go to war if I thought that the issues in<br />\nquestion were worth fighting for.

Anyway, when Carter said he<br />\nwould get tough with Russia, everybody in the<br />\nSocial Lounge stood up and cheered. But then<br />\nwhen Carter said he would ask Congress to bring<br />\nback the draft, everybody started booing.

He seems to look askance at the<br />\ndraft.<br />\n\"I find it a bit ludicrous that the same<br />\nchief executive who pardoned all Vietnam-era<br />\ndraft evaders could now seriously suggest the<br />\nregistering of American youth for compulsory<br />\nmilitary service,\" Mike says. \"I'm thoroughly<br />\nopposed to a peacetime draft, although I would<br />\nlike to have the best troops America could offer<br />\nunder my command in a wartime situation. I<br />\ndoubt very seriously that a selective service<br />\nsystem riddled with exclusionary exemptions<br />\nand deferments for all but poor males and<br />\nmembers of disadvantaged minorities could ever<br />\nhave any substantial qualitative effect on<br />\nAmerica's armed forces.\"<br />\nAccording to Mike, detente, \"if it ever<br />\nreally existed,\" is dead. \"The United States must<br />\nawaken to the fact that it possesses the only<br />\ncredible force in the world capable ultimately of<br />\nkeeping the Soviet Union out of the Persian Gulf<br />\nand the Indian Ocean.

It is devilcomedy<br />\na<br />\nishly ingeneous in its execution of both<br />\nforms, excitement building upon humor,<br />\nand vice-versa. The plot involves the<br />\nschemes of meek, seemingly unambitious Henry Holland (played by Sir Alec<br />\nGuiness), a bank clerk in charge of the<br />\ndelivery of gold bullion. Beneath his dry,<br />\nfastidious facade, Holland craves for<br />\na life of ease and sybartic abandon, but<br />\nhe doesn't dare attempt to steal the<br />\nbullion because of the impossibility of<br />\nsmuggling it. When he encounters Pendlebury(Stanley Holloway), a new tenant in<br />\nhis boarding house who manufactures<br />\ndie-cast,souveneirs, he finds his answer:<br />\nmelt the gold into Eiffel Tower paperweights, and ship them to Paris without<br />\nthe slightest suspicion. The plan works<br />\nwith almost perfect precision, until some<br />\nof the paperweights are accidentally<br />\nsold to a group of visiting London schoolgirls at the real Eiffel Tower. The pair<br />\nof thieves begin a mad chase to retrieve<br />\nthe deadly evidence.<br />\nThe film flows along with grace<br />\nand charming ease, mounting to an<br />\n<br />\nIt just might work... exhilarating frenzy as Holland and<br />\nPendlebury speed down a spiral staircase<br />\non the Tower in pursuit of the schoolgirls. The screenplay by T.E.B. Clarke<br />\n(which won an Academy Award), and the<br />\ndirection by Charles Crichton are both<br />\nmeticulously crafted with a consistent<br />\nand unerring sense of satirical wit. This is<br />\na film that demands to be seen again and<br />\nagain, each viewing proving further that it<br />\nis more than just droll heist cornedy, but a<br />\nlesson in filmmaking.<br />\nAs superb as the screenplay and<br />\ndirection may be, it is the acting more<br />\nthan anything else that makes the film<br />\nsuch a pleasure to watch. Guiness, an<br />\nactor of remarkable versatility and<br />\nrefined genius, proves, as in Kind Hearts<br />\nand Coronets and The Lady Killers (both<br />\nproduced by Ealing Studios), that he is<br />\n<br />\nbest at sophisticated comedy;his rubbery<br />\nface with its broad, child-like grin and<br />\nslightly manic eyes perfectly embodies<br />\nthe English blend of sedate propriety<br />\nand lurking madness, which Peter Sellers<br />\nwas to perpetuate later on in his own<br />\nmore exaggerated manner.<br />\nGuiness'<br />\nreserve and even-temperedness dominate<br />\nhis underlying lunacy throughout, except<br />\nin the chase scene down the Eiffel Tower,<br />\nwhen both Holland and Pendlebury<br />\nmomentarily break into a fit of helpless,<br />\ncarefree laughter at the whole idea of<br />\ntheir caper. During this scene, and in a<br />\nlater chase with the police, the restraint<br />\nof the film briefly breaks away to reveal<br />\nits mirth in full form; it is an indication<br />\nof the skill of the talents involved that<br />\nthese instances do not go beyond the<br />\nmood of the film, but are completely<br />\nconsistent with it. Stanley Holloway, as<br />\nPendlebury, makes a perfect counterpart<br />\nto Guiness; his absent-minded, bombastic<br />\nmanner balances his partner's mousey<br />\ndemeanor.<br />\nFor those accustomed to the<br />\nzanier, less disciplined British comedy<br />\nof the sixties, such as Richard Lester's<br />\nBeatles films, The Lavender Hill Mob<br />\nshould be a pleasant and refreshing<br />\nsurprise. It is sad to acknowledge the fact<br />\nthat inflation and outrageous taxation<br />\nhave all but put an end to great<br />\nmovie-making in England. This production is an apt reminder of what the<br />\nBritish film industry could once<br />\naccomplish.<br />\n<br />\nDancer<br />\ncont. from p.10<br />\n<br />\nIn retrospect, Facedancer's LP,<br />\nThis World, was neither as good as local<br />\ncritics made it out to be, nor as putrid as<br />\nnew wave partisans claimed it was.<br />\nObjectively speaking, it was a fairly<br />\nimpressive debut album. Although it<br />\nwimped out nearly as often as it kicked<br />\nin, one must consider the audience it was<br />\naimed at: people -in their mid-to-late<br />\nteens. People who,live and die with radio<br />\nstations like 98 Rock. People who aren't<br />\nconcerned with irrelevant concepts like<br />\noriginality and artistic integrity. People<br />\nwho wanna \"Rock and roll, Jack!\"<br />\nThe final figures aren't in yet, but<br />\naccording to Scott McGinn, This World<br />\nhas sold between 80,000 and 100,000<br />\ncopies. And that's quite respectable.

After all, it is rather difficult to get<br />\nworked up about a \"problem\" which<br />\nresults in each of us getting increasingly<br />\nhigher and higher grades for the same<br />\namount of work. What must be realized,<br />\nhowever, is that the 'A' we earn today<br />\nmeans much less than the same mark would<br />\nhave a dozen years ago. Frequently, an 'A'<br />\nnow means nothing beyond the fact<br />\nthat all the work for a particular class was<br />\nturned in on time with a minimum of<br />\nspelling errors. In other words, it denotes<br />\ncompetency instead of quality. When any<br />\nempty helmet can capture a 'C' merely by<br />\nshowing up for class and a 'B' by raising his<br />\nhand occasionally, then an 'A' has to cover<br />\neverything above such a level, which<br />\nconstitutes an extraordinary amount of territory. The 'A' has become so broad as to<br />\nbe meaningless.<br />\nGrade inflation also works in the<br />\nopposite direction. When an 'A' is perceived as the only \"acceptable\" grade, with<br />\neverything below it merely denoting<br />\nvarying degrees of failure, then pressure<br />\nbecomes intense. In classes where a curve is<br />\nemployed, or where grade inflation has not<br />\nrun rampant (such as the basic pre-med<br />\ncourses), the wild scramble for an 'A'<br />\nat any price is debilitating and often<br />\nunethical.<br /><br />\nThis is a strange contradiction: a<br />\ngrade which no longer means anything<br />\nsignificant, and yet which must be persued<br />\nwith ever-increasing effort. 'A' is the most<br />\nfrequently given grade at Hopkins, yet the<br />\nstudents are suffering because of it.<br />\nThere is no panacea for this unfortunate situation, but there is something<br />\nwhich could help significantly. If the new<br />\nplus/minus grading system is introduced, it<br />\ncould prove to be a partial answer to the<br />\nproblems of runaway grade inflation. By,<br />\nin effect, dividing the `A'ituto two grades<br />\nand the 'IV and 'C' into three, it will create<br />\na grading system sensitive enough to<br />\nseparate the wheat from the chaff. No<br />\nlonger will professors be faced with giving<br />\nstudents either \"the 'A' or the Abyss,\" and<br />\nthe space-filler will be differentiated from<br />\nthe scholar. The faculty has no hidden<br />\nmotive for proposing the change, being,<br />\nprompted by simple concern for the<br />\nstudents and for the quality of education at<br />\nHopkins. If we are motivated by similar<br />\nconcerns, then we should give the proposal<br />\nour firm support. Grades are taken seriously by the outside world, and should therefore be as meaningful and rational as we<br />\ncan possibly make them. The plus/minus<br />\nsystem will do just that, and diminish a<br />\nlittle of Hopkins' notorious cut-throat<br />\ncompetition in the bargain.<br /><br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\nPeter Choo<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nAnne McElwee<br /><br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nToots Naim<br />\nPhilip Schutzer<br />\nProduction Staff<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editor<br /><br />\nTom Schiller<br />\nJim Sidbury<br />\nMarian Tamburrino<br /><br />\nJeff Adelman<br />\nChris Hurley<br />\nDeborah Jones<br />\nP.J.

Doves disappear. 'Yes,' says<br />\nhawkish Senator Henry Jackson, 'a year ago I<br />\ntold the Russians that Salt II was dead. Remember,' he drops his voice, 'that if war<br />\ncomes, it won't be conventional this time; it will<br />\nbe nuclear.' We glance at each other, chilled -- a<br />\ngroup of about 30 hard-boiled reporters. Mr.<br />\nJackson seems almost exultant.\"<br />\nThe same thing is happening across the<br />\nUnited States. The nation seems to be hot for a<br />\nwar. Last week at a television press conference,<br />\nSenator Alan Cranston of California practically<br />\nbounced in his chair with elation over America's<br />\nnew fervor. Cranston fairly foamed at the mouth<br />\nlike a man who has just snapped out of long<br />\nperiod of impotence. The usually liberal senator<br />\nfrom California, like countless politicians,<br />\ncolumnists, and editorial writers, has already<br />\ndubbed this prodigious conflict-to-be \"World<br />\nWar III.\" The Big Big One.<br />\nPerhaps people feel so good about being<br />\nup in arms because it's a posture that has faded<br />\nalong with the American economy, military, and<br />\npsyche. By becoming combative, we presumably restore that posture and at the same time<br />\nvent all the frustrations of the past 15-odd years.<br />\nIn last Friday's Baltimore Sun, a Tom Flannery<br />\ncartoon depicted the Congress in thunderous<br />\napplause as President Carter stands in his<br />\nnew-fashioned cowboy outfit, complete with<br />\nStetson and six-shooters. John Wayne lives.<br />\nLast week, the president announced his<br />\nnew budget, which includes a substantial increase in military expenditures. The hardliners<br />\nbreathe a sign of relief. A strong defense is<br />\na must, but our current problems in the Middle<br />\nEast warrant not so much a beefed-up military<br />\nas a specific energy program. Every American<br />\npresident since Franklin Roosevelt has asked<br />\nCongress to come up with such a program but<br />\nnone yet exists. President Carter has always<br />\nsaid that the U.S. would not think twice about<br />\nfighting for control of the Persian Gulf, or more<br />\nspecifically, for its oil supply. If that is indeed<br />\nthe only reason we look on anxiously to the<br />\neast, then the U.S. would be wise to devote its<br />\nhuman and economic resources to devising ways<br />\nto met our energy needs, rather than to a war.<br />\nCertain factions say, \"America desperately needs that Arab crude, so we have no choice<br />\nbut to go in and fight for it.\" But what exactly<br />\nwould we be getting? In a few years, the United<br />\nStates will be spending nearly half of its productive<br />\ncapacity on OPEC oil. An absurd price;to say the<br />\nleast. By deepening our dependence on Middle<br />\nEast crude, by continuing without a concrete<br />\nenergy program, we will drive the U.S. economy,<br />\nand consequently the U.S. itself, into the<br />\nground. Wasting American lives in an oil war<br />\nwould only compound the tragedy. As Garry<br />\nWills points out, blood for oil is no bargain.<br />\nSome people don't see oil as the only<br />\nreason, or as any reason at all. The real reason,<br />\naccording to many hawks, is stopping -- or<br />\nstom in -- the Russians before the turn ever<br /><br />\nMiddle East nation into a branch office of the<br />\nKremlin. The president and whoever else is<br />\nformulating our policy have apparently not<br />\nlearned from the lessons of Vietnam.(What was<br />\nit that Santayana said about those who have not<br />\nstudied history?) Obviously, some of the Middle<br />\nEast leaders are quite upset because Mr. Carter<br />\nmade indirect threats to the Soviet Union on<br />\nbehalf of the universe and failed to ask any<br />\ncountry whether it wanted it our assistance in<br />\nthe first place. This week at the Pakistan<br />\nconference, the heads of 36 Islamic nations<br />\nshowed that at least for now they are willing to<br />\ndeal with Russia by themselves. The United<br />\nStates should not intervene, with either weapons<br />\nor advice, until.asked.<br />\nNow the registration and drafting of<br />\nyoung Americans is in the offing. The media<br />\nwould have us believe that these youths are as<br />\nstaunchly conservative as their parents. Locally,<br />\nChannel 11's Action News conducted \"random\"<br />\ninterviews last week with three Hopkins males<br />\nwho support a draft and war with the Russians,<br />\nand this week the station is running a series<br />\nwhich asserts that this country's young people<br />\nare \"very conservative .\" Maybe the majority of<br />\nthem are; it is nonetheless galling for one's<br />\ngeneration to be so casually pigeonholed (and<br />\nthus this article, which attempts to show that<br />\nnot everyone under 25 is marching to the same<br />\ndrummer).<br />\nDespite the hawkishness of so many<br />\nyoung Americans, I wonder how long that mood<br />\nwill last. By now they must have imagined, for<br />\ninstance, how it would feel to get zapped by<br />\none of those deadly gases that the Russians are<br />\nalready using in Afghanistan. Once such a<br />\nsobering thought and others like it sink in, will<br />\nthese young men and women remain so agreeable to conscription? As one Hopkins male<br />\ncandidly told me,\"The thought of going to war<br />\nand being in combat scares the living hell out of<br />\nme.\" (If the Seventies were The Me Decade,<br />\nthen the Eighties, at least in relation to the<br />\ndraft, could be The Not Me Decade.)<br />\nCongress won't decide on the draft until<br />\nthis May, at the earliest. American youths<br />\ntherefore have ample time to agonize over the<br />\npossiblity of their numbers coming up some<br />\nday. To that end, I recently asked some Hopkins<br />\nstudents how they felt about the draft, war,<br />\nPresident Carter, and other related matters. Of<br />\ncourse, this article is not intended as a representative sampling of the entire student body,<br />\nthough I have tried to maintain a balance of<br />\ndiffering opinions. My primary goal, in addition<br />\nto stating some of my.own ideas, was to give a<br />\ndozen students an opportunity to comment on a<br />\ndismayingly complex situation that affects them<br />\nsignificantly and in many cases, uncomfortably.<br />\nSandy,a senior, is of Japanese descent. At the<br />\nstart of World War II, both her parents were<br />\nincarcerated in a California prison camp for<br />\nJapanese-Americans. Anti-Japanese sentiment<br />\n.was running high in this country in the wake of<br />\n'the Pearl Harbor attack, and as might be expected, war is an es eciall un leasant to sic to<br /><br />\nSandy.<br />\n\"When I was fttle, all the kids in my<br />\nneighborhood would ask each other what<br />\nbranch of the service their fathers were in during<br />\nWorld War II,\" she recalls. \"I would be embarrassed by that question. I wouldn't know what<br />\nto say. I wasn't about to tell them that my<br />\nfather and my mother were both in a prisoner<br />\nof war camp.<br />\n\"The draft concerns me, not just because<br />\nit might affect me, but I have a brother of draft<br />\nage, too. If I were drafted, I wouldn't want to<br />\ngo, but I don't know if I have the energy to not<br />\ngo. If there's any legal way to avoid the draft,<br />\nthen I wouldn't go to war. But if I couldn't get<br />\naround it, then I suppose I would have to go.\"<br />\nOn the question of women and the draft,<br />\nSandy says, \"I think it's fair that women be<br />\nsubjected to selective service. I mean, if they<br />\nwant to gripe about getting equality for everything, then they should have to serve.\" She<br />\npaused, then laughed, \"It's fair, but I don't want<br /><br />\ntl<br /><br />\n!Hopkins students speak<br /><br />\nDraft: Pr<br />\nI<br /><br />\nby Patrick<br /><br />\nto go!\"<br />\nDon, a senior History major, favors<br />\nreinstating the draft. Though he declined to say<br />\nwhether or not he would go to war, Don offered<br />\nan analysis of the current situation in Afghanistan.<br />\n\"The Russians have desired a warm -water<br />\nport for nearly 200 years. Their invasion of<br />\nAfghanistan puts them very close to that goal.<br />\nAn Indian Ocean naval base would also further<br />\nthe Soviet strategy of encircling Western oil<br />\nsupplies.<br />\n\"The Soviets invaded Afghanistan,\" Don<br />\ncontinues, \"because they felt that the U.S. w as<br />\npreoccupied with the crisis in Iran and could not<br />\nmount an effective response. As events have<br />\nproven, the Soviet assessment was true. While<br />\nthe U.S. regular army has shrunk, our dependence on nuclear weapons has grown proportionately. The Russians have more tanks, trucks,<br />\nand soldiers than the U.S. Consequently,<br />\nAmerica has to sit by as the Soviets grab off<br />\nchunks of Asia and Africa.\"<br />\nCiting the volunteer army as \"a proven<br />\nfailure,\" Don adds, \"If you look back through<br />\nhistory, one of the founding fathers' greatest<br />\nworries was a standing army. They knew from<br />\nhistory that a professional army tends to look<br />\nafter its own interests, and that those interests<br />\nmay not always be consistent with those of the<br />\npeople. A civilian army, representing varied<br />\npeople and interests, is the best way to insure<br />\nthat the military does not exercise undue<br />\ninfluence over the government. It's time we<br />\nre-instituted the peacetime draft as part of our<br />\nenergetic program to revitalize our conventional<br />\nforces.\"<br />\nAs a candidate for the position of Naval<br />\nAviation Reserve Officer, Bill, a senior, is<br />\nunaffected by a draft. In the event of war, he<br />\ncould be one of the first to be called to combat.<br />\nBill wonders whether conscripted soldiers, who<br />\noften see military duty as \"an interruption of<br />\ntheir personal lives,\" would serve with the<br />\nloyalty and intensity of trained soldiers.<br />\n\"But,\" he says, \"an army of citizen-soldiers, who have reliquished their personal<br /><br />\nendeavors to fight for a just'or truly threatening<br />\nnational cause, can become an effective military<br />\nand national instrument, as in the Civil War and<br />\nWorld War II. What needs to be implemented<br />\nbefore a general conscription is a clear delineation of what a conscripted armed force would be<br />\nfighting for.<br />\n\"This country is still great for a number<br />\nof reasons. Among these is our diversity of<br />\npersonal interests. This pluralistic society, with<br />\nour personal liberties maintained, is our greatest<br />\nstrength. I don't think we should destroy it by<br />\nforcing our youth into national service without a<br />\nreason to serve. Those of us in the armed forces<br />\nwill always proudly serve our country. America's youth must also serve, whether by service<br />\nto their communities, their families, or their<br />\nprofessions. And if necessary, they must serve<br />\nas soldiers.\"<br />\nDoes Bill think that the reinstatement of<br />\nthe draft is purely a political move on President<br />\nCarter's part? \"Well, let me just say this: Even if<br /><br />\nakout,<br /><br />\n'ro &amp; Con<br />\nck Ercolano<br /><br />\n;<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\n;<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n-I did think that, I wouldn't say it publicly. The<br /><br />\nPresident is my Commander-in-Chief, and it<br />\nwouldn't be right to criticize him.\"<br />\nWhen asked how she felt about the draft,<br />\nLiz, a freshman, held out the peace-sign ring<br />\non her finger.<br />\n\"I was about to have my Fallopian tubes<br />\ntied,\" Liz said, \"but I think I'll wait a few years.<br />\nWhat would I do if I were drafted? I'd get<br />\npregnant real fast. I'm serious.\"<br />\nSam, a senior, sees President Carter<br />\ngetting caught in \"a very dangerous game<br />\nin which, for political reasons, he must keep<br />\nescalating his responses to Soviet actions or what<br />\nhe chooses to label 'acceptable' behavior on the<br />\nRussians' part. The next step seems to be the<br />\nbeginning of the draft, which I'm t,?posed to,<br />\nand then the only step left open would. seem to<br />\nbe the sending of troops. It seems stupid to take<br />\nthe first step down that road just because the<br />\nSoviets have sent some troops in to replace one<br />\nPuppet leader with another. If I am going to be<br />\nsent off to die in the name of freedom, it's not<br />\ngoing to be to prop up a Zia or a Khomeini.\"<br />\nUpon first hearing talk about the draft,<br />\nSam's immediate reaction was that he wouldn't<br />\ngo, no matter what. \"But after giving things a lot<br />\nof thought,\" he says, \"I think I might be willing<br />\nto go to war if I thought that the issues in<br />\nquestion were worth fighting for. But I definite] would not o blindl to fi ht for a dictator<br /><br />\nwho has no more respect for human rights than<br />\ndo the Soviets... I'm just not sure that I could<br />\nkill someone if I were sent to war. The idea of<br />\nthat is just something that I cannot come to<br />\ngrips with.\"<br />\nPhil, a junior: \"I'm convinced that many<br />\nopponents of the draft and registration explicitly and/or implicitly make the decision based on<br />\na gut reaction involving a refusal to do anything<br />\nso incredibly demanding, much as the spoiled<br />\nchild refuses to do its homework. Essentially,<br />\nmany of us are spoiled children, myself included<br />\nWe're unwilling to rnake the substantial<br />\ncommittment that the draft would require.<br />\nPerhaps it's time to leave the Sixties behind,<br />\nalong with the accompanying ideological and<br />\nphilosophical baggage, and at least admit to our<br />\nsuperficial motivations.\"<br />\nPhil wouldn't say whether or not he<br />\nwould go to war.<br />\n\"I haven't formulated any opinion on the<br />\ndraft yet,\" says Wayne, a freshman. \"Ask me<br />\nlater, okay?\"<br />\nHe pauses. \"Well, actually, there was one<br />\nthing I'd like to mention. I watched the President give his State of the Union address on the<br />\nTV in the Freshman Social Lounge. I was<br />\namazed \u2014 well, maybe 'amazed' is the wrong<br />\nword \u2014 I was bewildered, let's say, by the kids<br />\nwho were watching it with me. There was a<br />\nbunch of us. Anyway, when Carter said he<br />\nwould get tough with Russia, everybody in the<br />\nSocial Lounge stood up and cheered. But then<br />\nwhen Carter said he would ask Congress to bring<br />\nback the draft, everybody started booing. I<br />\nthought that was kind of hypocritical, ' these<br />\npeople wanting war but not wanting to fight it<br />\nthemselves.\"<br />\nMike, a senior, has been in the ROTC<br />\nprogram at Hopkins since he was a freshman,<br />\nand this May he will be commissioned as an<br />\nArmy officer. He seems to look askance at the<br />\ndraft.<br />\n\"I find it a bit ludicrous that the same<br />\nchief executive who pardoned all Vietnam-era<br />\ndraft evaders could now seriously suggest the<br />\nregistering of American youth for compulsory<br />\nmilitary service,\" Mike says. \"I'm thoroughly<br />\nopposed to a peacetime draft, although I would<br />\nlike to have the best troops America could offer<br />\nunder my command in a wartime situation. I<br />\ndoubt very seriously that a selective service<br />\nsystem riddled with exclusionary exemptions<br />\nand deferments for all but poor males and<br />\nmembers of disadvantaged minorities could ever<br />\nhave any substantial qualitative effect on<br />\nAmerica's armed forces.\"<br />\nAccording to Mike, detente, \"if it ever<br />\nreally existed,\" is dead. \"The United States must<br />\nawaken to the fact that it possesses the only<br />\ncredible force in the world capable ultimately of<br />\nkeeping the Soviet Union out of the Persian Gulf<br />\nand the Indian Ocean. I hate to sound like John<br />\nFoster Dulles, but we are back in the era of<br />\ncontainment once again.\"<br />\nMike adds that he doesn't think President<br />\nCarter is bringing back the draft in order to win<br />\nvotes. \"It would appear the President is simply<br />\nattempting to expand upon the menu of responsorial options available to him in light of the<br />\ncurrent world situation.\"<br />\nLinda, a junior, says that if the United<br />\nStates declared war on Russia, she would either<br />\njoin the Army or \"try to be of some service\" to<br />\nthe country. She feels it would be her \"moral<br />\nobligation.\"<br />\n\"I'm opposed to war, but I don't think<br />\ndraft evasion is a respossible or effective way of<br />\ndealing with the situation. I felt that recently<br /><br />\nRussia has been more and more uncooperative<br />\nIwith the U.S. Although the Afghanistan situation seems no different from any of the other<br />\n?recent wars Russia has lent its support to, I<br />\n,realize we have to draw the line somewhere.<br />\nlind with the lives of 50 hostages in the balance<br />\nand the possibility of having our foreign oil<br />\nsupply cut off, it might as well be here.\"<br />\nJoe, a junior, believes that a selective<br />\nservice system will do nothing to increase<br />\nAmerica's immediate defensive strength. \"The<br />\nlast decade should have taught us the danger of<br />\nlimiting perspectives and limiting the checks<br />\nover the White House and Congress. At best,<br />\nregistration for the draft is a paper tiger, not an<br />\naction, but a threat. Domestically, it is an<br />\nopportunistic and flashy show of leadership and<br />\npower. Abroad, the draft shows no strength<br />\nunless used.<br />\n\"I reserve my endorsement of war as an<br />\nalternative until I feel military strength is<br />\nwarranted, as must the President. Until then,<br />\nthe threat of a draft doesn't work.\"<br />\nStephen, a senior, has a curved spine, or as<br />\nhis malady is known in medical parlance, scoliosis. \"That's my excuse,\" he says. \"That's<br />\nhow I'm getting out of the draft. It was strange.<br />\nWhen I was watching President Carter give his<br />\nState of the Union address, my back started<br />\naching as soon as he mentioned the possibility<br />\nof the draft. By the end of his speech, I was all<br />\nhunched over. I looked like Quasimodo.<br />\n\"I wouldn't want to fight, but I would<br />\nparticipate in a non-violent branch of the<br />\nservice. I could work for the USO or an Army<br />\nnewpaper, something like that. But, I would<br />\na<br />\nnever carry a gun.\"<br />\nBy calling for a draft and becoming more<br />\naggressive, President Carter is consciously<br />\ntrying to change his image, according to<br />\nStephen. \"I guess the President's sick and tired<br />\nof being pushed around. Maybe he felt that he<br />\ncould stop that if he put on this tough-guy<br />\nimage.<br />\n\"What would I do if I were in Carter's<br />\nshoes? Well, for now anyway, I'd issue a deadline for the Russians, though I doubt that<br />\nthey'd ever back out.\"<br />\nRick, a senior: \"Last week after a class, I<br />\nwas walking through Gilman Quad with a<br />\nfriend of mine. We were talking about the draft<br />\nand war; he essentially was for both, I was<br />\nagainst them.<br />\n\"So, while we were walking and discussing the situation, the Gilman Hall clock tower<br />\nstruck twelve. All of a sudden, all these bells<br />\nstarted ringing. It was pretty funny, but also<br />\nspooky. I mean, it was so pat, so symbolic. Too<br />\nsymbolic, in fact.

It is devilcomedy<br />\na<br />\nishly ingeneous in its execution of both<br />\nforms, excitement building upon humor,<br />\nand vice-versa. The plot involves the<br />\nschemes of meek, seemingly unambitious Henry Holland (played by Sir Alec<br />\nGuiness), a bank clerk in charge of the<br />\ndelivery of gold bullion. Beneath his dry,<br />\nfastidious facade, Holland craves for<br />\na life of ease and sybartic abandon, but<br />\nhe doesn't dare attempt to steal the<br />\nbullion because of the impossibility of<br />\nsmuggling it. When he encounters Pendlebury(Stanley Holloway), a new tenant in<br />\nhis boarding house who manufactures<br />\ndie-cast,souveneirs, he finds his answer:<br />\nmelt the gold into Eiffel Tower paperweights, and ship them to Paris without<br />\nthe slightest suspicion. The plan works<br />\nwith almost perfect precision, until some<br />\nof the paperweights are accidentally<br />\nsold to a group of visiting London schoolgirls at the real Eiffel Tower. The pair<br />\nof thieves begin a mad chase to retrieve<br />\nthe deadly evidence.<br />\nThe film flows along with grace<br />\nand charming ease, mounting to an<br /><br />\nIt just might work... exhilarating frenzy as Holland and<br />\nPendlebury speed down a spiral staircase<br />\non the Tower in pursuit of the schoolgirls. The screenplay by T.E.B. Clarke<br />\n(which won an Academy Award), and the<br />\ndirection by Charles Crichton are both<br />\nmeticulously crafted with a consistent<br />\nand unerring sense of satirical wit. This is<br />\na film that demands to be seen again and<br />\nagain, each viewing proving further that it<br />\nis more than just droll heist cornedy, but a<br />\nlesson in filmmaking.<br />\nAs superb as the screenplay and<br />\ndirection may be, it is the acting more<br />\nthan anything else that makes the film<br />\nsuch a pleasure to watch. Guiness, an<br />\nactor of remarkable versatility and<br />\nrefined genius, proves, as in Kind Hearts<br />\nand Coronets and The Lady Killers (both<br />\nproduced by Ealing Studios), that he is<br /><br />\nbest at sophisticated comedy;his rubbery<br />\nface with its broad, child-like grin and<br />\nslightly manic eyes perfectly embodies<br />\nthe English blend of sedate propriety<br />\nand lurking madness, which Peter Sellers<br />\nwas to perpetuate later on in his own<br />\nmore exaggerated manner.<br />\nGuiness'<br />\nreserve and even-temperedness dominate<br />\nhis underlying lunacy throughout, except<br />\nin the chase scene down the Eiffel Tower,<br />\nwhen both Holland and Pendlebury<br />\nmomentarily break into a fit of helpless,<br />\ncarefree laughter at the whole idea of<br />\ntheir caper. During this scene, and in a<br />\nlater chase with the police, the restraint<br />\nof the film briefly breaks away to reveal<br />\nits mirth in full form; it is an indication<br />\nof the skill of the talents involved that<br />\nthese instances do not go beyond the<br />\nmood of the film, but are completely<br />\nconsistent with it. Stanley Holloway, as<br />\nPendlebury, makes a perfect counterpart<br />\nto Guiness; his absent-minded, bombastic<br />\nmanner balances his partner's mousey<br />\ndemeanor.<br />\nFor those accustomed to the<br />\nzanier, less disciplined British comedy<br />\nof the sixties, such as Richard Lester's<br />\nBeatles films, The Lavender Hill Mob<br />\nshould be a pleasant and refreshing<br />\nsurprise. It is sad to acknowledge the fact<br />\nthat inflation and outrageous taxation<br />\nhave all but put an end to great<br />\nmovie-making in England. This production is an apt reminder of what the<br />\nBritish film industry could once<br />\naccomplish.<br /><br />\nDancer<br />\ncont. from p.10<br /><br />\nIn retrospect, Facedancer's LP,<br />\nThis World, was neither as good as local<br />\ncritics made it out to be, nor as putrid as<br />\nnew wave partisans claimed it was.<br />\nObjectively speaking, it was a fairly<br />\nimpressive debut album. Although it<br />\nwimped out nearly as often as it kicked<br />\nin, one must consider the audience it was<br />\naimed at: people -in their mid-to-late<br />\nteens. People who,live and die with radio<br />\nstations like 98 Rock. People who aren't<br />\nconcerned with irrelevant concepts like<br />\noriginality and artistic integrity. People<br />\nwho wanna \"Rock and roll, Jack!\"<br />\nThe final figures aren't in yet, but<br />\naccording to Scott McGinn, This World<br />\nhas sold between 80,000 and 100,000<br />\ncopies. And that's quite respectable. With<br />\nbetter promotion from Capitol, he feels,<br />\nit would have done even better.<br />\nWhether or not Facedancer will<br />\nfall prey to the dreaded followup album<br />\njinx is open to speculation. From the<br />\nsound of things last night, their newer<br />\nmaterial does lack the bite of old standbys like \"Red Shoes\" and \"Cry Baby.\"<br />\nMcGinn, however, remains optimistic<br />\nabout the future.<br />\n\"New wave just can't keep it up<br />\nlike it is now,\" he says. \"Like disco, it'll<br />\nstart tapering off to something else. It'll<br />\nhave to change.\"<br />\n\"I think we're sort of on the<br />\nborder line, maybe a little ahead,\" he<br />\nThe Lavender Hill Mob will be adds. \"Hopefully, we'll be a part of<br />\nscreened by the Baltimore Film Forum the next style, and if we can start it off,<br />\non Tuesday, Feb. 5,8:00 p.m. in Remsen that would be great.\"<br />\nOne.<br />\nGreat for whom?<br />\nSenior Class P;on Series Presents.,.<br /><br />\nTHE JACK THE RIPPER MURDERS.<br /><br />\n'111-<br /><br />\n\u2018:it 444<br /><br />\nA Woody Allen Double Feature<br /><br />\nSherlock Holmes lifls flue veil of<br />\nsecrecy,corruplioh and terror al lhe<br />\nearl of Me lhrohe of Mimi Itself<br />\nClue by clue...murder by murder<br /><br />\nEverything You<br />\nAlways Wanted<br />\nTo Know<br />\nAbout Sex*<br />\n*But Were Afraid<br />\nTo Ask<br /><br />\nFri., Feb. 1 9:00<br />\nSat., Feb. 2 7:00 &amp; 11:00<br />\nSun., Feb. 3 9:00<br /><br />\n3<br />\n1#<br />\nFriday<br /><br />\ntw<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nSaturday vichlf\u00b07-04<br />\n'<br />\n7:30<br />\n10:00<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nFebruary I &amp; 2<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\nWAIT UNTIL<br />\nADMISSION IS $1.50 or $1 WITH ANY STUDENT I.D.,<br /><br />\n2n.r_ show.<br /><br />\nMIDNITE<br /><br />\nsimishing<br /><br />\nBANANAS<br /><br />\nFri., Feb. 1 7:00 &amp; 11:00<br />\nSat., Feb. 2 9:00<br />\nSun., Feb. 3 7:30<br /><br />\ncerebral thriller!<br />\nDeliciously diabolical<br />\nand quite possibly true.\"<br />\n-Bruce Williamsoit PLAYBOY<br /><br />\nDARK<br /><br />\nPrice $1.50 per show<br />\n($1.00 per show with JHU ID)<br />\nSHAFFER 3<br />\nNext Week: Russ Meyer Double Feature<br /><br />\nFinders Keepers<br />\nLovers Weepers<br /><br />\nSuper Vixens<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER PAGE 13<br /><br />\nFRESHMEN SOPHOMORES<br />\nIT'S NOT TOO LATE!!<br /><br />\nTOG(Ill<br />\nER<br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nRANO<br />\nUNOER<br />\nSEAL<br /><br />\nCONSIDER ENROLLING IN THE<br />\nMILITARY SCIENCE PROGRAM<br />\nAT JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\n,<br /><br />\nOf AM<br />\ni<br /><br />\n%[FAN<br />\nr'114<br />\n5..u13-tuN<br />\n4N PARK Ditsve<br /><br />\nTan% on Tnp<br />\n5,FT,FEB2 AT 9P.M.<br />\n2744 fl\\Y2flD VC.<br /><br />\nN-I. ofncE<br />\n0<br /><br />\nL9V STitteT<br /><br />\nWOITEll,f1?EilHlmen,r1WICID5<br />\nOF THE EOU1111(CIR fIRE(<br /><br />\ntett.spletT<br /><br />\not<br />\nv<br />\nI<br /><br />\nVVE ARE HE2E4*111 i<br /><br />\ni<br />\nn\"<br />\nX<br />\n!,<br /><br />\nt The Military Science Program provides the student<br />\nwith an opportrity to learn and practice the art of<br />\nleading people with training designed to prepare the<br />\nstudent to reach the pinnacle of his or her chosen<br />\nprofession.<br />\nt The Military Science Program enables the student<br />\nto learn about the military profession and the role<br />\nit plays in our democratic system of government.<br />\nt The Military Science Department provides student<br />\nmembership in a close - knit organization.<br />\nt No<br />\nobligation<br />\nfirst<br />\ntwo<br />\nyears.<br />\nt Be eligible to compete for an army scholarship.<br />\nt Last two years of the program receive $2500<br /><br />\nFor further information visit<br />\nroom 207,<br />\nMilitary Science Building<br />\n(behind the gym)<br />\nor call Captain Larry Satterwhite<br />\nat 338 - 7474/7475<br /><br />\nJewish Awareness We&amp;<br />\nWorld Jewry Taces -the 1980<br /><br />\nEVENTS<br /><br />\nSPEAKERS<br />\nt.<br /><br />\n'---\\)13<br />\n555<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nS.<br /><br />\n&gt;./<br /><br />\nJEWiSH AWARENESs WK.<br />\nSHOSHANA OVI) N<br /><br />\nFcb 3Sun*<br /><br />\nbatniewers,Assocjewists Charitusgatiputfiuul<br /><br />\nCrnot Nail<br /><br />\nFeb 5<br /><br />\n1h /,(2,50,<br /><br />\n11am `71\"92killewty<br /><br />\nTuesda.i,<br /><br />\nP01 730<br /><br />\np\"<br /><br />\nSTEVE 50LENDER<br />\nE.)4ct.thste ViCg Preciclent;AJc.WF<br /><br />\nac_Aaei:<br /><br />\n(\":<br />\nJEWISH AWA<br />\nFeb 3 Sunday_<br />\nCirtat Halt it am<br /><br />\nNESS WK.<br />\nb NCTEL bRUNCH<br /><br />\nb 4 MonciOV \u2022 Jewish sTuDENr-<br /><br />\nGarni-I-1- Room 3:30 py, COFFEE<br /><br />\n/ac'<br /><br />\nFeb Co 1/Vednesciay.,,<br /><br />\nFeb<br /><br />\n...RON 51--1/\\PIRO<br /><br />\nihursclAy<br /><br />\nrnzs., Daeuttatjemcit<br /><br />\nLV<br /><br />\nr3\u00b0 rn<br /><br />\nIZetaluots<br />\ninzucca/epotcy<br />\n/980<br /><br />\n/NL-1-- SPEAKERS<br /><br />\nEtht<br /><br />\nADMISSioN<br /><br />\nFREE<br /><br />\nS R,AEL D1-\\<br /><br />\nGrrat1-lau:aass<br /><br />\nC44/614-4.44 calC7f0\u2022Al<br /><br />\nFeb 8 Friday. .
