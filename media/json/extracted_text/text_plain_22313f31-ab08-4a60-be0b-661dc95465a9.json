While hailing the study<br />\nof a future fusion of Philosophy and Engineering,<br />\nthe implementation of a full graduate program in<br />\nthe liberal arts we must also recognize the need<br />\nto deal with pressing if less lofty) problems.<br />\nThey must be dealt with if the University is to<br />\nmove forward.<br />\n<br />\nEditors of a college newspaper are unique only in<br />\nmust take time from their studies to remain<br />\nthey<br />\nthat<br />\ncognizant of all that is happening within their community.<br />\nAfter fulfilling our duties and watching over the<br />\nHomewood Scene for a year, we see increasing signs<br />\nthat some Hopkins people are not content to allow the<br />\nUniversity to drift but are demanding thoughtful criticism as a starter, and action as a goal. This refreshing<br />\ndiscontent comes mainly from the faculty, from the<br />\nmen that are serving on the Long Range Planning Committee. It is good to see some dynamism in the faculty;<br />\nit would be even better if in the past year we had seen<br />\nsome of this dynamism in graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents as well. To he sure students are discontented,<br />\nmanifests itself in the<br />\nbut their discontent generally<br />\n\"dorm food stinks. ..<br />\ne.g.,<br />\nmutterings;<br />\nform of timless<br />\nI haven't seen my advisor in three years. .. they don't<br />\ngive a damn about undegraduates around here... they<br />\ntreat graduate students like scum\". .. etc.<br />\nSome graduate students simply do not care enough<br />\nto think through the problems they face at Hopkins.<br />\nOthers are genuinely concerned but fear\u2014with apparent<br />\njustification\u2014to openly express their dissatisfaction. The<br />\nlatter are likely to seek recourse through the NewsLetter.\"Why don't you do something about this?\",<br />\nthey ask.<br />\nUndergraduates are in even more of a fix. They<br />\nenjoy being discontented. Upperclassmen tell incoming<br />\nfreshmen just how had some things at Hopkins are,<br />\nand the freshmen soon find that their experience confirms what they have been told. Having discovered the<br />\nbasic truths of the Homewood, students accept them,<br />\ncomplain about them to each other, write home about<br />\nthem, and tell their girls about them. But that's all.<br />\nThey are simply too dull or too lazy to think out logical<br />\narguments for changing the existing order. One undergraduate group that tries to discuss problems is the<br />\nStudent Council. It would, indeed, be cruel to say that<br />\nthe Student Council has been something of a joke this<br />\nyear; but such a description would at least he objective.<br />\nThe Council's discussions are by and large petty if not<br />\nmeaningless. When the Council does stumble on to<br />\nsomething significant it still takes the wrong action.<br />\nWe find that with the undergraduates, as with graduate<br />\nstudents, the News-Letter is left to be the sole vehicle<br />\nof careful discussion and exposition of issues and problems at Homewood.<br />\nThe major issues of the past two years\u2014graduate<br />\nintructors, the Young Republicans, fraternity discrimination, the questionable adequacy of the dormitory facilities, and the issues of the Long-Range Planning Committee\u2014have been raised and discussed in the NewsLetter; only later carried over into some other group,<br />\nif at all. This is not as it should be. The News-Letter<br />\nshould serve as a forum where some issues can be<br />\nraised and discussed. But it is impossible for all the<br />\nissues that should he raised to be raised by one group.<br />\nThe primary task of the News-Letter is to report<br />\nnews.<br />\nNo other task can be allowed to detract from<br />\ndie<br />\nthis function.<br />\nIf neither the graduate nor undegraduate students<br />\ncan now meaningfully and productively discuss the issues<br />\nthat face them, what are they to do? Keep trying to<br />\nform workable discussion groups? Forget about the<br />\nwhole problem? Turn the problem over to the LRPC?<br />\nOr perhaps try a different idea that has worked at other<br />\nSchools. Some schools have set up group comprised of<br />\nstudents, faculty, and selected members of the Board of<br />\nTrustees and administrative personnel, to discuss their<br />\nmutual problems, each other's problems and the problems of their school as a whole.<br />\nThe establishment of such a group might be coneidered at Hopkins. There are many obstacles, of course,<br />\nbut the idea should not he summarily dismissed. Some<br />\nfeel that such a group is not needed, because all administration personnel and members of the Board already<br />\nknow some students. These contacts, however, do not<br />\nseem to have solved many problems. One should remember that it is not too difficult for a sharp member<br />\nof the administration to \"snow\" a sharp but inexperienced undergraduate or graduate student. Meeting as<br />\na group, students, faculty, administration, and board<br />\nmembers would find it easier to pin each other down,<br />\nand their very numbers would mean that more shades<br />\nof opinion and more suggestions and ideas could be<br />\nentertained.<br />\nWe suspect that the administration will be reluctant<br />\nto set up such a committee. Those who enjoy power<br />\nrarely are willing to give up even part of that power<br />\nor seek the help of those over whom they exercise that<br />\npower. Students and faculty will probably he forced to<br />\ncombine forces in pressuring the administration to<br />\nestablish the committee.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\npense our money as if it were a personal favor?<br />\nWho can explain the miniature free-standing<br />\nbrick wall outside Barton Hall?

MEGINNISS<br />\nThe chair of Greek, the first<br />\nprofessorship to be filled at the<br />\nnew university, was offered by<br />\nPresident Gilman to the remarkable Basil L. Gildersieeve. In<br />\nthe 40 years that followed, Prof.<br />\nGildersleeve was to be an immeasurable benefit to the growth<br />\nand reputation of Hopkins.<br />\nGilman had no doubts, such<br />\nas he was later to have about<br />\nthe appointment of J. J. Sylvester, when it came to choosing<br />\nGildersleeve. French, in his A<br />\nHistory of the University<br />\nFounded by Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwrites: \"The Gildersleeve Latin<br />\nGrammer, first published in 1867,<br />\nhad been followed by other textbooks of such excellence that<br />\ntheir author was already widely<br />\nrecognized. His literary taste and<br />\nskill; his nimble, if sometimes<br />\ncaustic, wit; his sound judgement and breadth of outlook<br />\nmade him an admirable senior<br />\nprofessor; and Gilman found in<br />\nhim a trusted friend and advisor.\"<br />\nSo much for the appointment,<br />\nbut what about the man and<br />\nhis background?<br />\nHe had received his A.B. at<br />\nPrinceton in 1849, when only 18,<br />\nand then went to Germany to<br />\nstudy at the Universities of<br />\nBerlin, Bann, and Gottingen. He<br />\nreceived his Ph.D. at the lastmentioned in 1853. At this point,<br />\nwith his formal education under<br />\nhis belt and his life (71 more<br />\nyears) still ahead, he could<br />\neasily have become a poet Or<br />\nessayist, but instead he chose<br />\nthe life of the scholar.<br />\nSCHOLARLY LIFE CHOSEN<br />\n1856 found him as Professor<br />\nof Greek at the University of<br />\nVirginia, in those turbulent times<br />\njust prior to the Civil War. When<br />\nwar finally came, he enlisted in<br />\nthe Confederate Cavalry, devoting his summers to fighting<br />\nand his winters to teaching<br />\nGreek. It was during one of these<br />\nsummers that he received a<br />\npermanently laming wound while<br />\nfighting in the upper Shenandoah valley. Years later he was<br />\nto write, in the true spirit of his<br />\nchosen profession.

The first<br />\nformal paper, presented to the<br />\nAssociation by one Charles L.<br />\nLanman, was appropriately entitled: \"The Two Original KAsounds<br />\nin<br />\nIndo-European.\"<br />\nGildersleeve became president of<br />\nthe Association, and continued to<br />\nhold that position until his retirement in 1915.<br />\nPHILOLOGICAL STUDIES<br />\nNot content to rest on past<br />\naccomplishments,<br />\nGildersleeve<br />\nsoon began to press for a Philological Journal, to support classical studies in this country. The<br />\nfirst edition of the American<br />\nJournal of Philology, under his<br />\neditorship, appeased in 1880. In<br />\nthe first issue of his Journal,<br />\nGildersleeve wrote: \"With the<br />\nhelp of the most active and enterprising scholars of America,<br />\nwith a large storehouse of European periodical literature for the<br />\nquickening and enriching of our<br />\nown work, with a generous support accorded in advance by the<br />\nmunificence of our new university and by the fraternal spirit<br />\nof fellow -workers through the<br />\nlength of the land, the Journal<br />\nenters upon a career that is full<br />\nof hope.\" His hope was fulfilled,<br />\nfor the Journal earned a highly<br />\nrecognized position, under his<br />\nforty years of editorship, and<br />\nstill holds this reputation today.<br />\nBasil Gildersleeve was certainly not afraid of work. In a letter<br />\ndated August 15, 1879, he wrote<br />\nGilman from his vacation spot<br />\nin Virginia: \"... these last weeks<br />\nof vacation must be devoted as<br />\nfar as possible to preparation for<br />\nnext session, which promises to<br />\nbe for me a year of very arduous<br />\n<br />\nwork.

While hailing the study<br />\nof a future fusion of Philosophy and Engineering,<br />\nthe implementation of a full graduate program in<br />\nthe liberal arts we must also recognize the need<br />\nto deal with pressing if less lofty) problems.<br />\nThey must be dealt with if the University is to<br />\nmove forward.<br /><br />\nEditors of a college newspaper are unique only in<br />\nmust take time from their studies to remain<br />\nthey<br />\nthat<br />\ncognizant of all that is happening within their community.<br />\nAfter fulfilling our duties and watching over the<br />\nHomewood Scene for a year, we see increasing signs<br />\nthat some Hopkins people are not content to allow the<br />\nUniversity to drift but are demanding thoughtful criticism as a starter, and action as a goal. This refreshing<br />\ndiscontent comes mainly from the faculty, from the<br />\nmen that are serving on the Long Range Planning Committee. It is good to see some dynamism in the faculty;<br />\nit would be even better if in the past year we had seen<br />\nsome of this dynamism in graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents as well. To he sure students are discontented,<br />\nmanifests itself in the<br />\nbut their discontent generally<br />\n\"dorm food stinks. ..<br />\ne.g.,<br />\nmutterings;<br />\nform of timless<br />\nI haven't seen my advisor in three years. .. they don't<br />\ngive a damn about undegraduates around here... they<br />\ntreat graduate students like scum\". .. etc.<br />\nSome graduate students simply do not care enough<br />\nto think through the problems they face at Hopkins.<br />\nOthers are genuinely concerned but fear\u2014with apparent<br />\njustification\u2014to openly express their dissatisfaction. The<br />\nlatter are likely to seek recourse through the NewsLetter.\"Why don't you do something about this?\",<br />\nthey ask.<br />\nUndergraduates are in even more of a fix. They<br />\nenjoy being discontented. Upperclassmen tell incoming<br />\nfreshmen just how had some things at Hopkins are,<br />\nand the freshmen soon find that their experience confirms what they have been told. Having discovered the<br />\nbasic truths of the Homewood, students accept them,<br />\ncomplain about them to each other, write home about<br />\nthem, and tell their girls about them. But that's all.<br />\nThey are simply too dull or too lazy to think out logical<br />\narguments for changing the existing order. One undergraduate group that tries to discuss problems is the<br />\nStudent Council. It would, indeed, be cruel to say that<br />\nthe Student Council has been something of a joke this<br />\nyear; but such a description would at least he objective.<br />\nThe Council's discussions are by and large petty if not<br />\nmeaningless. When the Council does stumble on to<br />\nsomething significant it still takes the wrong action.<br />\nWe find that with the undergraduates, as with graduate<br />\nstudents, the News-Letter is left to be the sole vehicle<br />\nof careful discussion and exposition of issues and problems at Homewood.<br />\nThe major issues of the past two years\u2014graduate<br />\nintructors, the Young Republicans, fraternity discrimination, the questionable adequacy of the dormitory facilities, and the issues of the Long-Range Planning Committee\u2014have been raised and discussed in the NewsLetter; only later carried over into some other group,<br />\nif at all. This is not as it should be. The News-Letter<br />\nshould serve as a forum where some issues can be<br />\nraised and discussed. But it is impossible for all the<br />\nissues that should he raised to be raised by one group.<br />\nThe primary task of the News-Letter is to report<br />\nnews.<br />\nNo other task can be allowed to detract from<br />\ndie<br />\nthis function.<br />\nIf neither the graduate nor undegraduate students<br />\ncan now meaningfully and productively discuss the issues<br />\nthat face them, what are they to do? Keep trying to<br />\nform workable discussion groups? Forget about the<br />\nwhole problem? Turn the problem over to the LRPC?<br />\nOr perhaps try a different idea that has worked at other<br />\nSchools. Some schools have set up group comprised of<br />\nstudents, faculty, and selected members of the Board of<br />\nTrustees and administrative personnel, to discuss their<br />\nmutual problems, each other's problems and the problems of their school as a whole.<br />\nThe establishment of such a group might be coneidered at Hopkins. There are many obstacles, of course,<br />\nbut the idea should not he summarily dismissed. Some<br />\nfeel that such a group is not needed, because all administration personnel and members of the Board already<br />\nknow some students. These contacts, however, do not<br />\nseem to have solved many problems. One should remember that it is not too difficult for a sharp member<br />\nof the administration to \"snow\" a sharp but inexperienced undergraduate or graduate student. Meeting as<br />\na group, students, faculty, administration, and board<br />\nmembers would find it easier to pin each other down,<br />\nand their very numbers would mean that more shades<br />\nof opinion and more suggestions and ideas could be<br />\nentertained.<br />\nWe suspect that the administration will be reluctant<br />\nto set up such a committee. Those who enjoy power<br />\nrarely are willing to give up even part of that power<br />\nor seek the help of those over whom they exercise that<br />\npower. Students and faculty will probably he forced to<br />\ncombine forces in pressuring the administration to<br />\nestablish the committee.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\npense our money as if it were a personal favor?<br />\nWho can explain the miniature free-standing<br />\nbrick wall outside Barton Hall?

MEGINNISS<br />\nThe chair of Greek, the first<br />\nprofessorship to be filled at the<br />\nnew university, was offered by<br />\nPresident Gilman to the remarkable Basil L. Gildersieeve. In<br />\nthe 40 years that followed, Prof.<br />\nGildersleeve was to be an immeasurable benefit to the growth<br />\nand reputation of Hopkins.<br />\nGilman had no doubts, such<br />\nas he was later to have about<br />\nthe appointment of J. J. Sylvester, when it came to choosing<br />\nGildersleeve. French, in his A<br />\nHistory of the University<br />\nFounded by Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwrites: \"The Gildersleeve Latin<br />\nGrammer, first published in 1867,<br />\nhad been followed by other textbooks of such excellence that<br />\ntheir author was already widely<br />\nrecognized. His literary taste and<br />\nskill; his nimble, if sometimes<br />\ncaustic, wit; his sound judgement and breadth of outlook<br />\nmade him an admirable senior<br />\nprofessor; and Gilman found in<br />\nhim a trusted friend and advisor.\"<br />\nSo much for the appointment,<br />\nbut what about the man and<br />\nhis background?<br />\nHe had received his A.B. at<br />\nPrinceton in 1849, when only 18,<br />\nand then went to Germany to<br />\nstudy at the Universities of<br />\nBerlin, Bann, and Gottingen. He<br />\nreceived his Ph.D. at the lastmentioned in 1853. At this point,<br />\nwith his formal education under<br />\nhis belt and his life (71 more<br />\nyears) still ahead, he could<br />\neasily have become a poet Or<br />\nessayist, but instead he chose<br />\nthe life of the scholar.<br />\nSCHOLARLY LIFE CHOSEN<br />\n1856 found him as Professor<br />\nof Greek at the University of<br />\nVirginia, in those turbulent times<br />\njust prior to the Civil War. When<br />\nwar finally came, he enlisted in<br />\nthe Confederate Cavalry, devoting his summers to fighting<br />\nand his winters to teaching<br />\nGreek. It was during one of these<br />\nsummers that he received a<br />\npermanently laming wound while<br />\nfighting in the upper Shenandoah valley. Years later he was<br />\nto write, in the true spirit of his<br />\nchosen profession. A Southerner<br />\nin the Peloppenesian War with<br />\nmany illuminating comparisons<br />\nbetween the two wars.<br />\nBut Basil Gildersleeve's greatest accomplishments waited until l<br />\nhe had begun his long and i<br />\nprofitable association with the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nIn May of 1877, Professor<br />\nGildersleeve i now at Hopkins)<br />\ncalled a meeting at which the<br />\nAmerican Philological Associa<br /><br />\ntion was organized. The first<br />\nformal paper, presented to the<br />\nAssociation by one Charles L.<br />\nLanman, was appropriately entitled: \"The Two Original KAsounds<br />\nin<br />\nIndo-European.\"<br />\nGildersleeve became president of<br />\nthe Association, and continued to<br />\nhold that position until his retirement in 1915.<br />\nPHILOLOGICAL STUDIES<br />\nNot content to rest on past<br />\naccomplishments,<br />\nGildersleeve<br />\nsoon began to press for a Philological Journal, to support classical studies in this country. The<br />\nfirst edition of the American<br />\nJournal of Philology, under his<br />\neditorship, appeased in 1880. In<br />\nthe first issue of his Journal,<br />\nGildersleeve wrote: \"With the<br />\nhelp of the most active and enterprising scholars of America,<br />\nwith a large storehouse of European periodical literature for the<br />\nquickening and enriching of our<br />\nown work, with a generous support accorded in advance by the<br />\nmunificence of our new university and by the fraternal spirit<br />\nof fellow -workers through the<br />\nlength of the land, the Journal<br />\nenters upon a career that is full<br />\nof hope.\" His hope was fulfilled,<br />\nfor the Journal earned a highly<br />\nrecognized position, under his<br />\nforty years of editorship, and<br />\nstill holds this reputation today.<br />\nBasil Gildersleeve was certainly not afraid of work. In a letter<br />\ndated August 15, 1879, he wrote<br />\nGilman from his vacation spot<br />\nin Virginia: \"... these last weeks<br />\nof vacation must be devoted as<br />\nfar as possible to preparation for<br />\nnext session, which promises to<br />\nbe for me a year of very arduous<br /><br />\nwork.
