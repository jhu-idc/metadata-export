Overriding all of<br />\nthem is one question: What the hell are<br />\nyou trying to accomplish?<br />\nI realize that, in certain aspects of our<br />\nsociety, the female of the species is much<br />\nmaligned. Yes, women should have a n<br />\nequal opportunity for employment. Yes,<br />\nwomen should have equal pay for equal<br />\njobs. Yes, women should be entitled to<br />\nthe same privileges and rights as the male<br />\nsex. Yes, I fully agree that there should<br />\nbe total equality between the sexes.<br />\n. But how do the women of Hopkins go<br />\nabout achieving this aim? (I assume this is<br />\ntheir aim.) They announce a meeting to<br />\n\"meet all women faculty\u2022 and<br />\nadministration members,\" but, according<br />\n<br />\nto an advertisement placed in the<br />\nNews-Letter, this invitation is extended<br />\nto \"all Hopkins woment\" only. Why is<br />\nthis meeting being limited to women?<br />\nToth states in her column that \"other<br />\nplans are also in the works, including<br />\ntaking over next year's Student Council.\"<br />\nWhat exactly is meant to be accomplished<br />\nby that?<br />\nDo the Hopkins women actually<br />\nexpect to achieve their goals by running<br />\nan inept Student Council? Or do they<br />\nplan to limit Hopkins government to \"all<br />\nHopkins woment\" as they limit their<br />\nmeetings?<br />\nThe official university housing policy<br />\ngives priority for the limited housing<br />\nspace to women. In fact, after complaints<br />\nto the administration last spring, the<br />\nUniversity guaranteed apartment space to<br />\nall Hopkins women, and even provided<br />\nthem with temporary housing this fall.<br />\nYet the University is not providing the<br />\nsame services for make students at all. In<br />\nWhy do women receive -sueh preferential<br />\ntreatment? President Muller says that<br />\n\"women (and I presume he is referring to<br />\nHopkins women) are understandably<br />\nmore intensely concerned with sex<br />\nrelated aspects of personal security off<br />\ncampus.\" In other words, Hopkins<br />\nwomen are demanding, and rightly so, all<br />\nof the privileges on campus that men are<br />\naccorded, but they also want to be<br />\ncoddled and accomodated at the expense<br />\nof the male students.<br />\nAfter reviewing all of these thoughts<br />\nand questions, it seems that I can only<br />\nreach one conclusion: all of you so-called<br />\nWomen's Lib members are a bunch of<br />\nuptight hypocrites. You demand equality,<br />\nand yet you are just as discriminatory and<br />\nsexist as the men whom you castigate and<br />\nagainst whom you campaign. You limit<br />\nmeetings to your own sex, plan political<br />\nactivities solely on the basis of sex, and<br />\ndemand specific privileges that are not<br />\ngiven to men. If that is fighting for<br />\nequality, it certainly is an off way to<br />\nfight. What would happen if male.<br />\nstudents had a meeting and excluded all<br />\nfemales'? Or demanded housing priorities<br />\nand guarantees'? Or planned political<br />\nactivities that would be specifically<br />\ndirected against the women members of<br />\nthis campus'?<br />\nYes, the Sister hood may be powerful,<br />\nbut all the power in the world won't help<br />\nyour cause if you practice what you<br />\npreach, as the JHU Women's Center, alias<br />\nthe JHU Women's Movement, appears to<br />\ndo.<br />\nMichael Siegel<br />\n<br />\nBy ROBERT RUBY<br />\nSunday was so nice. No, don't talk<br />\nabout the grey sky or the homework; the<br />\nday was pleasant in some places. Elliot<br />\nColeman read his poetry for almost a<br />\nhundred of us during the Sunday<br />\nExperience program in Levering Hall, and<br />\nthat substituted for the sun.<br />\n<br />\nHe began with \"Summer Sky,\" and it<br />\noffered a tine description of what some<br />\npeople call sky and maybe others heaven.<br />\n\"Great circle through which we seem / to<br />\nturn,..., / your illusion is our breath.\"<br />\nColeman said he wrote it on the morning<br />\nof his sixtieth birthday. Not by<br />\ncoincidence, there are sixty lines.<br />\n\"Touch and Go\" came next, and its<br />\nopening and closing lines were still<br />\nstriking to the people who had also heard<br />\nit read last spring. \"With us, any time, it's<br />\njust touch and go. / Whom shall we<br />\ntouch? Where shall we go?\" They are<br />\nfrighteningly symmetrical questions.<br />\nColeman spoke of his admiration for<br />\nwriter-diarist Anais Nin (\"Her novels were<br />\ntoo good to be recognized by editors. It's<br />\nthe same old story.\") and read a very<br />\nbrief poem dedicated to her. \"Station<br />\nEight\" was also centered on the subject<br />\nof women, describing them as \"the<br />\nsustainers, the beloved.\" In the poems,<br />\nthey are different from men. The third<br />\nwho you are, / But you are here.'Decide<br />\nthe identities for yourself, as we had to<br />\ndo.<br />\n\"Requiem,\" the only sestina (a<br />\ncomplex Italian verse form, framed by a<br />\none-stanza hymn and a closing lyric)<br />\nwhich Coleman has written, darkened the<br />\nmood. The author's enunciation of the<br />\nrepeated phrase \"bell tone\" reminded us<br />\nof a bell or chime sounding. Hearing<br />\nourselves read the text, listening to the<br />\nauthor, and reading the same lines silently<br />\nto ourselves result in three different<br />\npoems. Bell tone bell tone bell tone.<br />\n<br />\nhad to teach. I hate this.\" He wanted t . \"'it<br />\nread Yeats instead of his own poetry. Td<br />\nend the story, Coleman turned to<br />\nWickwire and asked, \"Not too much<br />\ngossip on Sunday, no?\"<br />\nIn answer to a queTtion asking why his<br />\npoems were so often melancholy,<br />\nColeman said, \"We couldn't do without<br />\ngrief. I've finished a new book of poems,<br />\nand it was born out of grief, but some\u2022<br />\ngood things came out of it.\" A pause, and<br />\nthen, \"I am really all for comedy and<br />\nhappiness.\" And he slapped his knee and<br />\nlaughed, and we laughed.

If you've ever wished<br />\nyou could have been the person in that<br />\npicture or wondered what's so enticing<br />\nabout fishing (or hunting or boating or<br />\nrelated \"outdoor sports), you should have<br />\nbeen at Parkville High School during the<br />\nweekend.<br />\nIt was ther that you could have<br />\nhobnobbed with the real sports<br />\nenthusiasts because on Saturday that was<br />\nthe place for Baltimore's celebration of<br />\nNational Hunting and Fishing Day, 1972.<br />\nThis \"Day,\" the first event of its kind<br />\n<br />\never held, was conceived as a public<br />\nrelations program by which sportsmen<br />\ncould give the average city-bred person a<br />\nsampling of what \"the outdoors\" can<br />\noffer in the way of recreation while it<br />\ncouldn't transport you bodily to the<br />\noutdoor activities, you could at least<br />\ncatch a glimpse of what the<br />\nworld-which-never-makes -headlines still<br />\nhas to offer.<br />\nAt the program I attended, \"Maryland<br />\nOutdoors '72,\" one could see live<br />\nfingerling trout, collect literature on<br />\nMaryland fishing spots, or witness the fly<br />\ncasting expertise of some of Maryland's<br />\nbest.

Coleman<br />\nrecalled Thomas looking in a men's room<br />\nmirror just before he was due to be<br />\nintroduced and saying, \"God, I'm old. I<br />\nhave to do this for a living, like my father<br />\n<br />\nNewlywed Game prompted my decision<br />\nthat I had earned a nap. Lying there with<br />\nmy eyes closed, trying to guess what<br />\nnumber bus was roaring by, the dawn<br />\nbroke: I would go over to Gilman Hall<br />\nand look in my mailbox!<br />\nGoing on over<br />\nTruckin' over to Gilman, the campus<br />\nwas pretty empty.

I<br />\nopened a book and started to throat.<br />\n<br />\nyour own duck decoys, to likely woods<br />\nhabitats for poisonous snakes. The<br />\nrepresentatives of local sportmen's<br />\n<br />\norganizations were more than eager to<br />\ntalk about their favorite pastimes.<br />\nSince I am a novice fly fisherman, one<br />\nof my reasons for attending the festivities<br />\nwas to pick up some pointers on my fly<br />\ncasting. Lefty Kreh, widely respected for<br />\nhis articles on fly casting (just as<br />\nprofessors are respected for their articles),<br />\nwas to be giving demonstrations and<br />\nindeed he was. Although I was at first<br />\nprepared to venture forth and confidently<br />\nask for advice on how to add a foot or<br />\ntwo to my thirty foot casts, I soon<br />\nrealized that I was out of my class. Lefty,<br />\na man who would rather be fishing than<br />\nwriting, was effortlessly casting the entire<br />\ncontents of his reel, sending the tip of his<br />\nline a distance of close to 100 feet. Fly<br />\ncasting doesn't involve a stationary toss<br />\nof the line, which would make the task<br />\nrelatively easy. Instead it requires that the<br />\nangler lay out the entire length of line he<br />\nintends to cast and put it into both<br />\nbackward and forward motion before he<br />\ncan deliver it (and the bait\u2014usually a<br />\nhand-tied imitation \"fly,\" hence the<br />\nname fly casting) to the distant target.<br />\nLefty's cast of thirty plus yards was no<br />\nmean feat and even the veteran fly<br />\nfishermen around me were impressed. I<br />\ncould only marvel, my plans for putting<br />\nout my own line and doing some practice<br />\ncasts myself for the audience completely<br />\ngone from my mind.<br />\nSince I actually have been in those<br />\nwhite water and pine settings, the<br />\nNational Hunting and Fishing Day<br />\nprogram succeeded in carrying me far<br />\nbeyond the confines of Baltimore, as<br />\nmemories were awakened by some<br />\nexhibit or demonstration. But whether or<br />\nnot you have ever sampled the \"wonders<br />\nof the great outdoors,\" it really can offer<br />\nyou an infinite variety of enjoyable times.<br />\nAn that, by showing and telling, was the<br />\nchief message the folks were trying to get<br />\nacross this weekend.'<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letter/september 26, 1972<br />\n<br />\nMcGovernites active on Homewood campus<br />\n<br />\nWith over 80 volunteers signed<br />\nup, the McGovern campaign<br />\norganization at Homewood is at<br />\nwork on all fronts for the six<br />\nweek effort ahead, with emphasis<br />\non the tasks of voter registration<br />\nand fund-raising.<br />\nWith less than two weeks of<br />\nvoter registration in Baltimore,<br />\nthe registration committee is<br />\nworking to contact as many<br />\nHopkins students as possible to<br />\nurge those not enrolled to do so<br />\nby the October 7 deadline.

Presently located at<br />\nHuntington and 30th Streets, the<br />\ngroup is headed by Charles<br />\nDeems, President of the<br />\nRemington Improvement<br />\nAssociation. Steven Harris, a<br />\nformer Legal Aid lawyer, is<br />\nDirector of the Center's<br />\nPrograms.<br />\n.According to Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick, Dean of Students,<br />\nSecond District City Councilman,<br />\nand one of House Center's<br />\nOriginal incorporaters, the group<br />\nIS now<br />\nwell-established in the<br />\nRemington neighborhood.<br />\nPrograms<br />\nHouse Center offers<br />\nr ecreational facilities such as<br />\nPIng-pong, billiards, and<br />\ntelevision to the area's youth.<br />\nFitzpatrick describes the program<br />\n\u00b0fferings as an effort to give<br />\n<br />\nRemington teenagers an<br />\nalternative to Baltimore Street<br />\nlife, and consequently, to drug<br />\nusage.<br />\nAnother dimension of the<br />\nCenter's offerings has been its<br />\nAdult Education Program,<br />\ncreated to inform area parents of<br />\nthe different types, symptoms,<br />\nand dangers of drug abuse. The<br />\ngroup is currently co-sponsoring,<br />\nalong with Hopkin's CODE, a<br />\nseminar series on drug usage. It is<br />\nhoped that the seminars will<br />\nserve to broaden the adult<br />\ncommunity's awareness of drug<br />\nproblems in Baltimore.<br />\nPast Problems Overcome<br />\nIn January and early February<br />\nof last winter, the group suffered<br />\nproblems ranging from H.E.W.'s<br />\nfailure to deliver promised<br />\noperating funds, to charges levied<br />\nat them of mismanagement and<br />\nirresponsible, unaccountable use<br />\nof previously received funds.<br />\nAt that time, Fitzpatrick<br />\nwrote in a letter to H.E.W.<br />\nSecretary Elliot Richardson \"..I<br />\nam writing to request an<br />\nimmediate suspension of funds<br />\nfor House Center, Inc., pending a<br />\nreappraisal of the entire<br />\n<br />\nprogram.\" In the letter,<br />\nFitzpatrick went on to explain<br />\nthat the staff of the Center could<br />\naccount for neither the $3,983<br />\ninitial allocation of the $40,000<br />\ngrant appropriated it by H.E.W.,<br />\nnor some $7,500 loaned to the<br />\nCenter by the University.<br />\nHe added that staff resumes<br />\nwere not available and did not<br />\neven exist. Fitzpatrick also cited<br />\nthe fact that, according to the<br />\nterms of the H.E.W. grant, the<br />\nfunds for the program were to be<br />\nused in the Remington area.<br />\nHouse Center had moved its<br />\nlocation several times, he<br />\nexplained, with each new<br />\nlocation being outside the<br />\nRemington neighborhood.<br />\nThe responsibility for such<br />\nmismanagement, wrote<br />\nFitzpatrick, was largely H.E.W.'s,<br />\nsince the Department had failed<br />\nto monitor the group's financial<br />\nexpenditures and had made no<br />\neffort to determine the group's<br />\nefficacy. The University's $7,500<br />\nloan to the group was necessary,<br />\nhe continued, because H.E.W.<br />\nhad failed to release needed<br />\noperating funds according to the<br />\ntimetable of the grant.<br />\n<br />\non the field as soon as possible,<br />\nbut with no threat of permanent<br />\ninjury due to improper healing.<br />\nDuring a game, Brandy can be<br />\nseen on the sidelines intently<br />\npeering onto the playing field.<br />\nShould trouble arise, Brandy is<br />\nusually the first one to spot it. If<br />\nthe situation warrants, Brandy<br />\nwill sprint out to give aid to the<br />\nstricken athlete, although most<br />\nof the time the player is not<br />\nseriously hurt and resumes<br />\nplaying or walks to the bench<br />\nunder his own power.<br />\nOccasionally Brandy is forced<br />\nto make crucial decisions. Should<br />\na player be kept out of a game?<br />\nHow extensive are game-incurred<br />\ninjuries? Should the injured be<br />\nsent to the hospital? These<br />\ndecisions often make the<br />\ndifference between whether an<br />\nathlete plays again, walks again,<br />\nor even lives.<br />\nWhirlpool Baths<br />\nAfter an injury, rehabilitation<br />\nis required. Whirlpool baths,<br />\nhydrocolator pads, sound<br />\nmachines, and a diathermy are<br />\nsome of the equipment available<br />\nfor use in the training room.<br />\nOperation and supervision of this<br />\nequipment and taping take up<br />\nmost of Brandy's time.<br />\nBut he still finds time to treat<br />\nprofessors, students, alumni, and<br />\nfriends of the University. In<br />\naddition, high school players<br />\nfrom Baltimore City, Baltimore<br />\nCounty, and Anne Arundel<br />\nCounty find their way to the<br />\nHopkins training room. Even<br />\nmembers of the Baltimore press<br />\ncorps and the professional sports<br />\nteams seek out Brandy for one of<br />\nhis \"special treatments.\"<br />\nDuring the spring, Brandy has<br />\nhandled the training duties of the<br />\nCarling's, Mt. Washington,<br />\nMaryland, Schaefer, and Towson<br />\nLacrosse Clubs. Treatment was<br />\nalso given to the members of the<br />\ntouring_ Austrolian All-Star<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse Team and the English<br />\nBoys Lacrosse Team during their<br />\nvisits to Baltimore last spring.<br />\nHe has handled Spring Grove<br />\nand Johnny Leone's amateur<br />\nbaseball teams, the Baltimore<br />\nEagles emi-pro football team, the<br />\nAnne Arundel County<br />\nCommunity College sports teams,<br />\nthe 1968 Southern Collegiate All<br />\nStar Lacrosse Team,and the Club<br />\nLacrosse All Star teams for the<br />\npast four years.<br />\nOld Bays<br />\nLikewise Brandy was an<br />\nassistant trainer for the old<br />\nBaltimore Bays soccer team and<br />\ncared for the St. Louis, Dallas,<br />\nand Kansas City teams when they<br />\ncame into Baltimore.

Hopkins<br />\ndominated the game both<br />\noffensively and defensively,<br />\ntallying twice as many first<br />\ndowns as Muhlenberg (20 to 10),<br />\nand amassing over twice as many<br />\ntotal yards(363 to 168).<br />\nTight end Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nscored twice for the victors on<br />\nshort passes from quarterback<br />\nJack Thomas, while defensive<br />\nback Billy Nolan electrified the<br />\ncrowd with an 82-yard punt<br />\nreturn for a touchdown. The<br />\nhome team's only scoring play<br />\ncame on a 2-yard run by halfback<br />\nKen Hedden in the third period.<br />\nThe contest saw the Jays jump<br />\nout to an early lead, which the<br />\nMules hardly threatened<br />\nthroughout the contest. In the<br />\nmiddle of the first quarter, Jack<br />\nThomas marshalled his troops on<br />\nan 88-yard march to the game's<br />\nfirst score. The drive featured<br />\npowerful running from halfback<br />\nTim Doyle, who by the game's<br />\nend had notched 121 of the<br />\nteam's 234 yards on the ground.<br />\nThe scoring came on a 2-yard<br />\npass from Thomas to Kowalchuk<br />\nwith 6:32 on the clock. Thomas<br />\nkicked the extra point.<br />\nAfter the ensuing kick-oft,<br />\nMuhlenberg was unable to sustain<br />\na drive and was forced to punt.<br />\nLittle Billy Nolan took the punt<br />\non his own 18-yard line and took<br />\noff on an 82-yard romp to the<br />\nend zone, slipping from the<br />\ngrasps of the frustrated<br />\nMuhlenberg defenders. With the<br />\nPAT try unsuccessful, this made<br />\nthe score 13-0, Hopkins.<br />\nBoth teams threatened, but<br />\nfailed to get on the board, during<br />\nthe scoreless second period. The<br />\nMules moved the ball inside the<br />\nBlue Jay 10-yard line but lost<br />\npossession on downs as the Jays'<br />\ndefense stiffened. Immediately<br />\nafterwards, Hopkins began<br />\nanother sustained drive.<br />\n<br />\nJay Gridders display winningform.<br />\nQuarterback Thomas hooked up<br />\nwith ends Kowalchuck and Grant<br />\nShevchik on big third-down<br />\nplays, and sent Doyle into the<br />\nline for more big yards. The<br />\ndrive, however, was stalled at the<br />\nMuhlenberg 17, and went<br />\nunrewarded when Thomas missed<br />\non a 34-yard field goal attempt.<br />\nThe half ended with Hopkins in<br />\nthe lead, 13-0.<br />\nIn the third quarter<br />\nMuhlenberg began to come back.<br />\nThey gained good field position<br />\nfor their first series of downs<br />\nwhen Blue Jay punter Thomas<br />\nflubbed a punt from his own 46,<br />\ngiving the Mules the ball at their<br />\n44-yard line. Two plays later,<br />\nFreshman signal caller Mike Reid<br />\nrolled right and heaved a 44-yard<br />\nbomb to end Randy Boll. Boll<br />\nwas blanketed by two Jay<br />\ndefenders, and the pass was a bit<br />\nlong, but he made a sensational<br />\ndiving catch to give the Mules a<br />\nfirst and goal at the Hopkins 6.<br />\nFrom there, the Mules cracked<br />\nthe Hopkins defensive line with<br />\nthree straight running plays, with<br />\nKen Hedden going through a big<br />\nhole from two yards out on third<br />\ndown. Trygve Kleppinger's kick<br />\nwas good, putting the score at<br />\n13-7 with 9:32 remaining in the<br />\nquarter.<br />\nFollowing the kick-off,<br />\nHopkins came back with another<br />\n<br />\nHopkins soccer team<br />\ndrops opener, 4e-1<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nHaverford College took<br />\nadvantage of an ineffective<br />\nshowing by Johns Hopkins to<br />\nhumiliate the Blue Jays, 4-1, in<br />\nSaturday's soccer opener at<br />\nHaverford.<br />\nThe Blue Jays put their feet to<br />\nthe ball well throughout the<br />\ngame, demonstrating good<br />\npassing and moving the ball well<br />\non offense. In fact, Hopkins<br />\ndominated possession of the ball<br />\nfor a majority of the ninety<br />\nminute game.<br />\nHowever, when Haverford's<br />\nhot shot right wing, Dan Kim,<br />\ntook the first shot on the<br />\nHopkin's goal for his team and<br />\nscored, a different taste entered<br />\nthe mouths of the Jays.<br />\nSenior Marc Manzione tied the<br />\nscore with an unassisted goal<br />\nsome five minutes later, but<br />\nHaverford retaliated within the<br />\nnext minute of play to take a 2-1<br />\nlead which would have sufficed<br />\nas a final score.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins definitely outclassed<br />\nthe Haverford team. Now that<br />\nHaverford no longer has a<br />\nfootball team it seemed as<br />\nthough they decided to put the<br />\nroughness of the football game<br />\ninto their soccer. It was obvious<br />\nthat they were a much more<br />\nphysical team than the Blue Jays<br />\nwho continuously had their<br />\noffensive plays disrupted by<br />\npenalties, a great many of which<br />\nwent unnoticed by the officials.<br />\nDefeat<br />\nHaverford scored two more<br />\ntimes, once more in the first half<br />\nand once in the second to drop<br />\nthe Blue Jays to a 4-1 defeat in<br />\ntheir first game of their season.<br />\nThe booters will be trying not<br />\nonly to even their losing record,<br />\nbut also to avenge a 2-0 defeat in<br />\nthe worst possible field<br />\nconditions in last year's game<br />\nagainst Towson State. The Blue<br />\nJays will play host to the Tigers<br />\nthis Saturday at the soccer field<br />\nat 12 noon.<br />\n<br />\ndisplay of offensive power, which<br />\nwas snuffed out only by bad<br />\nfortune. From their own 25, the<br />\nJays used up nearly five minutes<br />\nof clock time, marching 58 yards,<br />\n49 of them on running plays to<br />\nDoyle, Pat Neary, Hal Altman,<br />\nand Jim Ferguson. From the<br />\nMuhlenberg 17, Thomas threw<br />\nonly his second pass of the series<br />\nto Billy Nolan, who was open<br />\nand streaking across into the end<br />\nzone. The pass, however, was a<br />\nlittle high and behind Nolan, who<br />\ntipped the ball into the air trying<br />\nto reach back for it. Receiver and<br />\ndefenders alike all collided, but<br />\nMuhlenberg's Pete Molendyke<br />\nalertly dove into the melee and<br />\n<br />\npicked off the ball in mid-air.<br />\nMuhlenberg took possession<br />\non their 20 with a chance to<br />\nchange the momentum of the<br />\ngame in their favor. Quarterback<br />\nReid looked sharp on two clutch<br />\nthird-down passes, but the<br />\nrunning game went nowhere and<br />\nthe Mules were forced to punt. It<br />\nproved to be their last big threat<br />\nin the game.<br />\nFollowing the punt, Hopkins<br />\niced the contest with its last big<br />\ndrive of the day. This one<br />\nconsumed 51<br />\n/<br />\n2 minutes and 13<br />\nplays, and covered 85 yards. Jack<br />\nThomas kept the Mule defense<br />\noff-balance with masterful<br />\nplay-calling, while the Hopkins<br />\noffensive line blew open big<br />\nholes. Doyle, Ferguson, and<br />\nNeary carried the ball so<br />\neffectively that the Jays never<br />\nfaced a third-down situation until<br />\nthey got inside the Muhlenberg<br />\n10. That time, the Jays faced a<br />\n'fourth and one from the 8, after<br />\nNeary had been stopped on third<br />\nand two.

Overriding all of<br />\nthem is one question: What the hell are<br />\nyou trying to accomplish?<br />\nI realize that, in certain aspects of our<br />\nsociety, the female of the species is much<br />\nmaligned. Yes, women should have a n<br />\nequal opportunity for employment. Yes,<br />\nwomen should have equal pay for equal<br />\njobs. Yes, women should be entitled to<br />\nthe same privileges and rights as the male<br />\nsex. Yes, I fully agree that there should<br />\nbe total equality between the sexes.<br />\n. But how do the women of Hopkins go<br />\nabout achieving this aim? (I assume this is<br />\ntheir aim.) They announce a meeting to<br />\n\"meet all women faculty\u2022 and<br />\nadministration members,\" but, according<br /><br />\nto an advertisement placed in the<br />\nNews-Letter, this invitation is extended<br />\nto \"all Hopkins woment\" only. Why is<br />\nthis meeting being limited to women?<br />\nToth states in her column that \"other<br />\nplans are also in the works, including<br />\ntaking over next year's Student Council.\"<br />\nWhat exactly is meant to be accomplished<br />\nby that?<br />\nDo the Hopkins women actually<br />\nexpect to achieve their goals by running<br />\nan inept Student Council? Or do they<br />\nplan to limit Hopkins government to \"all<br />\nHopkins woment\" as they limit their<br />\nmeetings?<br />\nThe official university housing policy<br />\ngives priority for the limited housing<br />\nspace to women. In fact, after complaints<br />\nto the administration last spring, the<br />\nUniversity guaranteed apartment space to<br />\nall Hopkins women, and even provided<br />\nthem with temporary housing this fall.<br />\nYet the University is not providing the<br />\nsame services for make students at all. In<br />\nWhy do women receive -sueh preferential<br />\ntreatment? President Muller says that<br />\n\"women (and I presume he is referring to<br />\nHopkins women) are understandably<br />\nmore intensely concerned with sex<br />\nrelated aspects of personal security off<br />\ncampus.\" In other words, Hopkins<br />\nwomen are demanding, and rightly so, all<br />\nof the privileges on campus that men are<br />\naccorded, but they also want to be<br />\ncoddled and accomodated at the expense<br />\nof the male students.<br />\nAfter reviewing all of these thoughts<br />\nand questions, it seems that I can only<br />\nreach one conclusion: all of you so-called<br />\nWomen's Lib members are a bunch of<br />\nuptight hypocrites. You demand equality,<br />\nand yet you are just as discriminatory and<br />\nsexist as the men whom you castigate and<br />\nagainst whom you campaign. You limit<br />\nmeetings to your own sex, plan political<br />\nactivities solely on the basis of sex, and<br />\ndemand specific privileges that are not<br />\ngiven to men. If that is fighting for<br />\nequality, it certainly is an off way to<br />\nfight. What would happen if male.<br />\nstudents had a meeting and excluded all<br />\nfemales'? Or demanded housing priorities<br />\nand guarantees'? Or planned political<br />\nactivities that would be specifically<br />\ndirected against the women members of<br />\nthis campus'?<br />\nYes, the Sister hood may be powerful,<br />\nbut all the power in the world won't help<br />\nyour cause if you practice what you<br />\npreach, as the JHU Women's Center, alias<br />\nthe JHU Women's Movement, appears to<br />\ndo.<br />\nMichael Siegel<br /><br />\nBy ROBERT RUBY<br />\nSunday was so nice. No, don't talk<br />\nabout the grey sky or the homework; the<br />\nday was pleasant in some places. Elliot<br />\nColeman read his poetry for almost a<br />\nhundred of us during the Sunday<br />\nExperience program in Levering Hall, and<br />\nthat substituted for the sun.<br /><br />\nHe began with \"Summer Sky,\" and it<br />\noffered a tine description of what some<br />\npeople call sky and maybe others heaven.<br />\n\"Great circle through which we seem / to<br />\nturn,..., / your illusion is our breath.\"<br />\nColeman said he wrote it on the morning<br />\nof his sixtieth birthday. Not by<br />\ncoincidence, there are sixty lines.<br />\n\"Touch and Go\" came next, and its<br />\nopening and closing lines were still<br />\nstriking to the people who had also heard<br />\nit read last spring. \"With us, any time, it's<br />\njust touch and go. / Whom shall we<br />\ntouch? Where shall we go?\" They are<br />\nfrighteningly symmetrical questions.<br />\nColeman spoke of his admiration for<br />\nwriter-diarist Anais Nin (\"Her novels were<br />\ntoo good to be recognized by editors. It's<br />\nthe same old story.\") and read a very<br />\nbrief poem dedicated to her. \"Station<br />\nEight\" was also centered on the subject<br />\nof women, describing them as \"the<br />\nsustainers, the beloved.\" In the poems,<br />\nthey are different from men. The third<br />\nwho you are, / But you are here.'Decide<br />\nthe identities for yourself, as we had to<br />\ndo.<br />\n\"Requiem,\" the only sestina (a<br />\ncomplex Italian verse form, framed by a<br />\none-stanza hymn and a closing lyric)<br />\nwhich Coleman has written, darkened the<br />\nmood. The author's enunciation of the<br />\nrepeated phrase \"bell tone\" reminded us<br />\nof a bell or chime sounding. Hearing<br />\nourselves read the text, listening to the<br />\nauthor, and reading the same lines silently<br />\nto ourselves result in three different<br />\npoems. Bell tone bell tone bell tone.<br /><br />\nhad to teach. I hate this.\" He wanted t . \"'it<br />\nread Yeats instead of his own poetry. Td<br />\nend the story, Coleman turned to<br />\nWickwire and asked, \"Not too much<br />\ngossip on Sunday, no?\"<br />\nIn answer to a queTtion asking why his<br />\npoems were so often melancholy,<br />\nColeman said, \"We couldn't do without<br />\ngrief. I've finished a new book of poems,<br />\nand it was born out of grief, but some\u2022<br />\ngood things came out of it.\" A pause, and<br />\nthen, \"I am really all for comedy and<br />\nhappiness.\" And he slapped his knee and<br />\nlaughed, and we laughed.

If you've ever wished<br />\nyou could have been the person in that<br />\npicture or wondered what's so enticing<br />\nabout fishing (or hunting or boating or<br />\nrelated \"outdoor sports), you should have<br />\nbeen at Parkville High School during the<br />\nweekend.<br />\nIt was ther that you could have<br />\nhobnobbed with the real sports<br />\nenthusiasts because on Saturday that was<br />\nthe place for Baltimore's celebration of<br />\nNational Hunting and Fishing Day, 1972.<br />\nThis \"Day,\" the first event of its kind<br /><br />\never held, was conceived as a public<br />\nrelations program by which sportsmen<br />\ncould give the average city-bred person a<br />\nsampling of what \"the outdoors\" can<br />\noffer in the way of recreation while it<br />\ncouldn't transport you bodily to the<br />\noutdoor activities, you could at least<br />\ncatch a glimpse of what the<br />\nworld-which-never-makes -headlines still<br />\nhas to offer.<br />\nAt the program I attended, \"Maryland<br />\nOutdoors '72,\" one could see live<br />\nfingerling trout, collect literature on<br />\nMaryland fishing spots, or witness the fly<br />\ncasting expertise of some of Maryland's<br />\nbest.

The first step in<br />\ndeciding what one wants to do is to<br />\neliminate those things one should do but<br />\nis loath to.

I<br />\nopened a book and started to throat.<br /><br />\nyour own duck decoys, to likely woods<br />\nhabitats for poisonous snakes. The<br />\nrepresentatives of local sportmen's<br /><br />\norganizations were more than eager to<br />\ntalk about their favorite pastimes.<br />\nSince I am a novice fly fisherman, one<br />\nof my reasons for attending the festivities<br />\nwas to pick up some pointers on my fly<br />\ncasting. Lefty Kreh, widely respected for<br />\nhis articles on fly casting (just as<br />\nprofessors are respected for their articles),<br />\nwas to be giving demonstrations and<br />\nindeed he was. Although I was at first<br />\nprepared to venture forth and confidently<br />\nask for advice on how to add a foot or<br />\ntwo to my thirty foot casts, I soon<br />\nrealized that I was out of my class. Lefty,<br />\na man who would rather be fishing than<br />\nwriting, was effortlessly casting the entire<br />\ncontents of his reel, sending the tip of his<br />\nline a distance of close to 100 feet. Fly<br />\ncasting doesn't involve a stationary toss<br />\nof the line, which would make the task<br />\nrelatively easy. Instead it requires that the<br />\nangler lay out the entire length of line he<br />\nintends to cast and put it into both<br />\nbackward and forward motion before he<br />\ncan deliver it (and the bait\u2014usually a<br />\nhand-tied imitation \"fly,\" hence the<br />\nname fly casting) to the distant target.<br />\nLefty's cast of thirty plus yards was no<br />\nmean feat and even the veteran fly<br />\nfishermen around me were impressed. I<br />\ncould only marvel, my plans for putting<br />\nout my own line and doing some practice<br />\ncasts myself for the audience completely<br />\ngone from my mind.<br />\nSince I actually have been in those<br />\nwhite water and pine settings, the<br />\nNational Hunting and Fishing Day<br />\nprogram succeeded in carrying me far<br />\nbeyond the confines of Baltimore, as<br />\nmemories were awakened by some<br />\nexhibit or demonstration.

Presently located at<br />\nHuntington and 30th Streets, the<br />\ngroup is headed by Charles<br />\nDeems, President of the<br />\nRemington Improvement<br />\nAssociation. Steven Harris, a<br />\nformer Legal Aid lawyer, is<br />\nDirector of the Center's<br />\nPrograms.<br />\n.According to Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick, Dean of Students,<br />\nSecond District City Councilman,<br />\nand one of House Center's<br />\nOriginal incorporaters, the group<br />\nIS now<br />\nwell-established in the<br />\nRemington neighborhood.<br />\nPrograms<br />\nHouse Center offers<br />\nr ecreational facilities such as<br />\nPIng-pong, billiards, and<br />\ntelevision to the area's youth.<br />\nFitzpatrick describes the program<br />\n\u00b0fferings as an effort to give<br /><br />\nRemington teenagers an<br />\nalternative to Baltimore Street<br />\nlife, and consequently, to drug<br />\nusage.<br />\nAnother dimension of the<br />\nCenter's offerings has been its<br />\nAdult Education Program,<br />\ncreated to inform area parents of<br />\nthe different types, symptoms,<br />\nand dangers of drug abuse. The<br />\ngroup is currently co-sponsoring,<br />\nalong with Hopkin's CODE, a<br />\nseminar series on drug usage. It is<br />\nhoped that the seminars will<br />\nserve to broaden the adult<br />\ncommunity's awareness of drug<br />\nproblems in Baltimore.<br />\nPast Problems Overcome<br />\nIn January and early February<br />\nof last winter, the group suffered<br />\nproblems ranging from H.E.W.'s<br />\nfailure to deliver promised<br />\noperating funds, to charges levied<br />\nat them of mismanagement and<br />\nirresponsible, unaccountable use<br />\nof previously received funds.<br />\nAt that time, Fitzpatrick<br />\nwrote in a letter to H.E.W.<br />\nSecretary Elliot Richardson \"..I<br />\nam writing to request an<br />\nimmediate suspension of funds<br />\nfor House Center, Inc., pending a<br />\nreappraisal of the entire<br /><br />\nprogram.\" In the letter,<br />\nFitzpatrick went on to explain<br />\nthat the staff of the Center could<br />\naccount for neither the $3,983<br />\ninitial allocation of the $40,000<br />\ngrant appropriated it by H.E.W.,<br />\nnor some $7,500 loaned to the<br />\nCenter by the University.<br />\nHe added that staff resumes<br />\nwere not available and did not<br />\neven exist. Fitzpatrick also cited<br />\nthe fact that, according to the<br />\nterms of the H.E.W. grant, the<br />\nfunds for the program were to be<br />\nused in the Remington area.<br />\nHouse Center had moved its<br />\nlocation several times, he<br />\nexplained, with each new<br />\nlocation being outside the<br />\nRemington neighborhood.<br />\nThe responsibility for such<br />\nmismanagement, wrote<br />\nFitzpatrick, was largely H.E.W.'s,<br />\nsince the Department had failed<br />\nto monitor the group's financial<br />\nexpenditures and had made no<br />\neffort to determine the group's<br />\nefficacy. The University's $7,500<br />\nloan to the group was necessary,<br />\nhe continued, because H.E.W.<br />\nhad failed to release needed<br />\noperating funds according to the<br />\ntimetable of the grant.<br /><br />\non the field as soon as possible,<br />\nbut with no threat of permanent<br />\ninjury due to improper healing.<br />\nDuring a game, Brandy can be<br />\nseen on the sidelines intently<br />\npeering onto the playing field.<br />\nShould trouble arise, Brandy is<br />\nusually the first one to spot it. If<br />\nthe situation warrants, Brandy<br />\nwill sprint out to give aid to the<br />\nstricken athlete, although most<br />\nof the time the player is not<br />\nseriously hurt and resumes<br />\nplaying or walks to the bench<br />\nunder his own power.<br />\nOccasionally Brandy is forced<br />\nto make crucial decisions. Should<br />\na player be kept out of a game?<br />\nHow extensive are game-incurred<br />\ninjuries? Should the injured be<br />\nsent to the hospital? These<br />\ndecisions often make the<br />\ndifference between whether an<br />\nathlete plays again, walks again,<br />\nor even lives.<br />\nWhirlpool Baths<br />\nAfter an injury, rehabilitation<br />\nis required. Whirlpool baths,<br />\nhydrocolator pads, sound<br />\nmachines, and a diathermy are<br />\nsome of the equipment available<br />\nfor use in the training room.<br />\nOperation and supervision of this<br />\nequipment and taping take up<br />\nmost of Brandy's time.<br />\nBut he still finds time to treat<br />\nprofessors, students, alumni, and<br />\nfriends of the University. In<br />\naddition, high school players<br />\nfrom Baltimore City, Baltimore<br />\nCounty, and Anne Arundel<br />\nCounty find their way to the<br />\nHopkins training room. Even<br />\nmembers of the Baltimore press<br />\ncorps and the professional sports<br />\nteams seek out Brandy for one of<br />\nhis \"special treatments.\"<br />\nDuring the spring, Brandy has<br />\nhandled the training duties of the<br />\nCarling's, Mt.

Hopkins<br />\ndominated the game both<br />\noffensively and defensively,<br />\ntallying twice as many first<br />\ndowns as Muhlenberg (20 to 10),<br />\nand amassing over twice as many<br />\ntotal yards(363 to 168).<br />\nTight end Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nscored twice for the victors on<br />\nshort passes from quarterback<br />\nJack Thomas, while defensive<br />\nback Billy Nolan electrified the<br />\ncrowd with an 82-yard punt<br />\nreturn for a touchdown. The<br />\nhome team's only scoring play<br />\ncame on a 2-yard run by halfback<br />\nKen Hedden in the third period.<br />\nThe contest saw the Jays jump<br />\nout to an early lead, which the<br />\nMules hardly threatened<br />\nthroughout the contest. In the<br />\nmiddle of the first quarter, Jack<br />\nThomas marshalled his troops on<br />\nan 88-yard march to the game's<br />\nfirst score. The drive featured<br />\npowerful running from halfback<br />\nTim Doyle, who by the game's<br />\nend had notched 121 of the<br />\nteam's 234 yards on the ground.<br />\nThe scoring came on a 2-yard<br />\npass from Thomas to Kowalchuk<br />\nwith 6:32 on the clock. Thomas<br />\nkicked the extra point.<br />\nAfter the ensuing kick-oft,<br />\nMuhlenberg was unable to sustain<br />\na drive and was forced to punt.<br />\nLittle Billy Nolan took the punt<br />\non his own 18-yard line and took<br />\noff on an 82-yard romp to the<br />\nend zone, slipping from the<br />\ngrasps of the frustrated<br />\nMuhlenberg defenders. With the<br />\nPAT try unsuccessful, this made<br />\nthe score 13-0, Hopkins.<br />\nBoth teams threatened, but<br />\nfailed to get on the board, during<br />\nthe scoreless second period. The<br />\nMules moved the ball inside the<br />\nBlue Jay 10-yard line but lost<br />\npossession on downs as the Jays'<br />\ndefense stiffened. Immediately<br />\nafterwards, Hopkins began<br />\nanother sustained drive.<br /><br />\nJay Gridders display winningform.<br />\nQuarterback Thomas hooked up<br />\nwith ends Kowalchuck and Grant<br />\nShevchik on big third-down<br />\nplays, and sent Doyle into the<br />\nline for more big yards. The<br />\ndrive, however, was stalled at the<br />\nMuhlenberg 17, and went<br />\nunrewarded when Thomas missed<br />\non a 34-yard field goal attempt.<br />\nThe half ended with Hopkins in<br />\nthe lead, 13-0.<br />\nIn the third quarter<br />\nMuhlenberg began to come back.<br />\nThey gained good field position<br />\nfor their first series of downs<br />\nwhen Blue Jay punter Thomas<br />\nflubbed a punt from his own 46,<br />\ngiving the Mules the ball at their<br />\n44-yard line. Two plays later,<br />\nFreshman signal caller Mike Reid<br />\nrolled right and heaved a 44-yard<br />\nbomb to end Randy Boll. Boll<br />\nwas blanketed by two Jay<br />\ndefenders, and the pass was a bit<br />\nlong, but he made a sensational<br />\ndiving catch to give the Mules a<br />\nfirst and goal at the Hopkins 6.<br />\nFrom there, the Mules cracked<br />\nthe Hopkins defensive line with<br />\nthree straight running plays, with<br />\nKen Hedden going through a big<br />\nhole from two yards out on third<br />\ndown. Trygve Kleppinger's kick<br />\nwas good, putting the score at<br />\n13-7 with 9:32 remaining in the<br />\nquarter.<br />\nFollowing the kick-off,<br />\nHopkins came back with another<br /><br />\nHopkins soccer team<br />\ndrops opener, 4e-1<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nHaverford College took<br />\nadvantage of an ineffective<br />\nshowing by Johns Hopkins to<br />\nhumiliate the Blue Jays, 4-1, in<br />\nSaturday's soccer opener at<br />\nHaverford.<br />\nThe Blue Jays put their feet to<br />\nthe ball well throughout the<br />\ngame, demonstrating good<br />\npassing and moving the ball well<br />\non offense. In fact, Hopkins<br />\ndominated possession of the ball<br />\nfor a majority of the ninety<br />\nminute game.<br />\nHowever, when Haverford's<br />\nhot shot right wing, Dan Kim,<br />\ntook the first shot on the<br />\nHopkin's goal for his team and<br />\nscored, a different taste entered<br />\nthe mouths of the Jays.<br />\nSenior Marc Manzione tied the<br />\nscore with an unassisted goal<br />\nsome five minutes later, but<br />\nHaverford retaliated within the<br />\nnext minute of play to take a 2-1<br />\nlead which would have sufficed<br />\nas a final score.<br /><br />\nHopkins definitely outclassed<br />\nthe Haverford team. Now that<br />\nHaverford no longer has a<br />\nfootball team it seemed as<br />\nthough they decided to put the<br />\nroughness of the football game<br />\ninto their soccer. It was obvious<br />\nthat they were a much more<br />\nphysical team than the Blue Jays<br />\nwho continuously had their<br />\noffensive plays disrupted by<br />\npenalties, a great many of which<br />\nwent unnoticed by the officials.<br />\nDefeat<br />\nHaverford scored two more<br />\ntimes, once more in the first half<br />\nand once in the second to drop<br />\nthe Blue Jays to a 4-1 defeat in<br />\ntheir first game of their season.<br />\nThe booters will be trying not<br />\nonly to even their losing record,<br />\nbut also to avenge a 2-0 defeat in<br />\nthe worst possible field<br />\nconditions in last year's game<br />\nagainst Towson State. The Blue<br />\nJays will play host to the Tigers<br />\nthis Saturday at the soccer field<br />\nat 12 noon.<br /><br />\ndisplay of offensive power, which<br />\nwas snuffed out only by bad<br />\nfortune. From their own 25, the<br />\nJays used up nearly five minutes<br />\nof clock time, marching 58 yards,<br />\n49 of them on running plays to<br />\nDoyle, Pat Neary, Hal Altman,<br />\nand Jim Ferguson. From the<br />\nMuhlenberg 17, Thomas threw<br />\nonly his second pass of the series<br />\nto Billy Nolan, who was open<br />\nand streaking across into the end<br />\nzone. The pass, however, was a<br />\nlittle high and behind Nolan, who<br />\ntipped the ball into the air trying<br />\nto reach back for it. Receiver and<br />\ndefenders alike all collided, but<br />\nMuhlenberg's Pete Molendyke<br />\nalertly dove into the melee and<br /><br />\npicked off the ball in mid-air.<br />\nMuhlenberg took possession<br />\non their 20 with a chance to<br />\nchange the momentum of the<br />\ngame in their favor. Quarterback<br />\nReid looked sharp on two clutch<br />\nthird-down passes, but the<br />\nrunning game went nowhere and<br />\nthe Mules were forced to punt. It<br />\nproved to be their last big threat<br />\nin the game.<br />\nFollowing the punt, Hopkins<br />\niced the contest with its last big<br />\ndrive of the day. This one<br />\nconsumed 51<br />\n/<br />\n2 minutes and 13<br />\nplays, and covered 85 yards. Jack<br />\nThomas kept the Mule defense<br />\noff-balance with masterful<br />\nplay-calling, while the Hopkins<br />\noffensive line blew open big<br />\nholes. Doyle, Ferguson, and<br />\nNeary carried the ball so<br />\neffectively that the Jays never<br />\nfaced a third-down situation until<br />\nthey got inside the Muhlenberg<br />\n10. That time, the Jays faced a<br />\n'fourth and one from the 8, after<br />\nNeary had been stopped on third<br />\nand two. On the fourth-down<br />\nplay, Thomas faked into the line,<br />\nrolled right, and fired to<br />\nKowalchuk who had gotten<br />\nbehind his defenders in the end<br />\nzone. The reception climaxed an<br />\noutstanding afternoon for the<br />\nHicksville, N.Y. junior, who<br />\ncaught: 9 of the Hays' 11<br />\ncompleted passes, for 112 of the<br />\nteam's 129 passing yards. His<br /><br />\nsecond TD catch made the score<br />\n19-7 (the PAT attempt missed)<br />\nwith 9:51 left in the game.<br />\nFor the rest of the game it was<br />\nall the Johns HOpkins defense, as<br />\nMuhlenberg had the ball for four<br />\nmore offensive series. Looking<br />\nfor the pass, the Blue Jay<br />\ndefensive line teed off on<br />\nquarterback Reid and dumped<br />\nthe courageous freshman four<br />\ntimes during the last half of the<br />\nquarter. When he did get time to<br />\npass, the secondary covered and<br />\nreacted well, breaking up all but<br />\nthree short passes in eleven<br />\nattempts.
