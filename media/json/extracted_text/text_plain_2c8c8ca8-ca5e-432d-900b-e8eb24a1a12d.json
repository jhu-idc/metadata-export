NOTE)<br />\nThose faculty members and students who looked over the bulletin<br />\nboards upon their return to Hopkins last week may have noticed an announcement to the effect that a collection of books, to be displayed in a<br />\nspecial alcove, would be formally presented to the University by the Italian<br />\nGovernment, through its consul, on Sunday, October 6. Those who visited<br />\nthe Main Library no doubt observed the rows of books, in cardboard covers<br />\nof high visibility, awaiting the ceremony which was to make them iart of<br />\nthe Italian Alcove.<br />\nThis event at Hopkins, coinciding almost exactly with the bombing of<br />\nAduwa, could hardly have been timed to take on greater significance.<br />\nFascist Suppression<br />\nThirteen years of Fascist dictatorship, maintained by repeated acts of<br />\nviolence, the destruction of civil liberties, the persecution of intellectuals,<br />\nand the militarization of youth, have rightly brought the Italian Government into disrepute.

The reasons for this protest will be<br />\nclear to anyone who considers the following questions:<br />\nWhy does the Italian Government proffer gifts to American universities, when its own universities are relatively deserted and the standard of<br />\nEmbargo On Warring, Pros- living of students in the dormitories has distinctly fallen?<br />\nWhy does that government insist upon, and through its consul, pay for<br />\npective Belligerent Nations a prominent display of the books it presents?<br />\n(Continued on Page 3, Col. 3, 4)<br />\nIs Proposed By Socialist<br />\n<br />\nAn outline of Hopkins athletics,<br />\nboth varsity and non-varsity, was<br />\npresented to the freshmen and sophomores at the assembly yesterday in<br />\nLatrobe Hall by the coaches and captains of the various sports.

These bugs which<br />\nalso infested the bathrooms\u2014an action hitherto unheard<br />\nof in bugs of a related specie\u2014kept the girls from going<br />\nto the bathroom to bathe for days at a stretch, until the<br />\nbathrooms finally started coming to the girls.<br />\n0\u20140<br />\n<br />\nIn spite of the above mentioned discovery, and the<br />\nspaghetti and beans suppers, the most popular saying<br />\namong the College Park coed freshman is, \"Ain't it a<br />\ndream.\" (For those unenlightened few of which I<br />\nfound myself one on this particular instance, due to my<br />\nfamiliarity with conditions at Maryland, this quotation<br />\n<br />\nThis Week's Aviation Story Of Ensign A. W. Dunning, I<br />\nRelated By G. G. Duce, President Of The<br />\nHopkins Aero Club<br />\nEnsign A. W. Dunning is attached<br />\nto the Aircraft Carrier U. S. S. Saratoga in Squadron VF-1, the \"High<br />\nHat\" squadron, famous for its acrobatics. This squadron was filmed in<br />\nthe motion picture \"Hell-Divers\",<br />\nfeaturing Wallace Beery.<br />\nWhile attached to the Saratoga,<br />\nEnsign Dunning figured in a rescue<br />\nthat made naval history. During fleet<br />\nexercises off the west coast of Mexico, he was forced to land at sea when<br />\nhis motor suddenly went dead. He<br />\nwas one hundred miles from land and<br />\nthere were no ships in sight. The<br />\nimpact of the landing rendered nim<br />\nunconscious.<br />\n\"It was like smashing into the side<br />\nof a mountain,\" Dunning says. \"Just<br />\nhow long I was unconscious is hard<br />\nto tell. The next thing I recall was<br />\nfinding myself upside down, well under water, and still lashed tightly<br />\nand braced in the cockpit. I fumbled for my safety belt and unhooked<br />\nit and finally got on top. The plane<br />\nwas sinking rapidly.<br />\n\"Hurriedly I took off all of my<br />\ngear except my life-jacket, and then<br />\ntook a deep breath of air and dove<br />\ndown to the cockpit again, found the<br />\nfloatation toggle (which releases<br />\ncompressed carbon dioxide into bags<br />\ncarried into the wings) and pulled<br />\nit. A hissing, bubbling sound told me<br />\nthe gear was working and I came up<br />\nfor air once more. I planned to rest<br />\na little and 'allow the plane to arise<br />\non her bags before attempting to dive<br />\ndown again in an effort to get out<br />\n<br />\nmy rubber boat and emergency gear.<br />\nBut it never did rise. The rough sea<br />\ntore the bags away, and, as the plane<br />\nsank from under me, I scrambled<br />\nalong the wing in time to catch one<br />\nof the bags and hang on.<br />\n\"Airplanes that I had not seen before were buzzing around. I noticed<br />\none fellow in a fighter staggering<br />\nabout in a .brave effort to do something. Probably he was trying to get<br />\nout his life raft to drop to me, but<br />\nhe couldn't quite make it. A bomber<br />\npilot circled low to try his luck in<br />\nthe dramatic rescue. First I thought<br />\nhe was going to land beside me, then<br />\n1 saw one of the mechanics out on<br />\nthe wing pulling off some of the<br />\ncowling; he was getting out his rubber boat to drop to me. Would he inflate it first, then heave it over?<br />\n\"If he should, I thought my chance<br />\nof getting to it would be small, because the wind might blow it away.<br />\nAround again he came, this time<br />\nlower and slower; and when right<br />\nclose by, he heaved it over. That<br />\ntruly was a remarkable feat, one<br />\nwhich took skill and courage. That<br />\nraft dropped on the windward side,<br />\nwhich was decidedly to my advantage.\"<br />\nDunning climbed aboard the raft<br />\nand later was picked up by a destroyer.

Those who visited<br />\nthe Main Library no doubt observed the rows of books, in cardboard covers<br />\nof high visibility, awaiting the ceremony which was to make them iart of<br />\nthe Italian Alcove.<br />\nThis event at Hopkins, coinciding almost exactly with the bombing of<br />\nAduwa, could hardly have been timed to take on greater significance.<br />\nFascist Suppression<br />\nThirteen years of Fascist dictatorship, maintained by repeated acts of<br />\nviolence, the destruction of civil liberties, the persecution of intellectuals,<br />\nand the militarization of youth, have rightly brought the Italian Government into disrepute.

The reasons for this protest will be<br />\nclear to anyone who considers the following questions:<br />\nWhy does the Italian Government proffer gifts to American universities, when its own universities are relatively deserted and the standard of<br />\nEmbargo On Warring, Pros- living of students in the dormitories has distinctly fallen?<br />\nWhy does that government insist upon, and through its consul, pay for<br />\npective Belligerent Nations a prominent display of the books it presents?<br />\n(Continued on Page 3, Col. 3, 4)<br />\nIs Proposed By Socialist<br /><br />\nAn outline of Hopkins athletics,<br />\nboth varsity and non-varsity, was<br />\npresented to the freshmen and sophomores at the assembly yesterday in<br />\nLatrobe Hall by the coaches and captains of the various sports.

Saratoga in Squadron VF-1, the \"High<br />\nHat\" squadron, famous for its acrobatics. This squadron was filmed in<br />\nthe motion picture \"Hell-Divers\",<br />\nfeaturing Wallace Beery.<br />\nWhile attached to the Saratoga,<br />\nEnsign Dunning figured in a rescue<br />\nthat made naval history. During fleet<br />\nexercises off the west coast of Mexico, he was forced to land at sea when<br />\nhis motor suddenly went dead. He<br />\nwas one hundred miles from land and<br />\nthere were no ships in sight. The<br />\nimpact of the landing rendered nim<br />\nunconscious.<br />\n\"It was like smashing into the side<br />\nof a mountain,\" Dunning says. \"Just<br />\nhow long I was unconscious is hard<br />\nto tell. The next thing I recall was<br />\nfinding myself upside down, well under water, and still lashed tightly<br />\nand braced in the cockpit. I fumbled for my safety belt and unhooked<br />\nit and finally got on top. The plane<br />\nwas sinking rapidly.<br />\n\"Hurriedly I took off all of my<br />\ngear except my life-jacket, and then<br />\ntook a deep breath of air and dove<br />\ndown to the cockpit again, found the<br />\nfloatation toggle (which releases<br />\ncompressed carbon dioxide into bags<br />\ncarried into the wings) and pulled<br />\nit. A hissing, bubbling sound told me<br />\nthe gear was working and I came up<br />\nfor air once more. I planned to rest<br />\na little and 'allow the plane to arise<br />\non her bags before attempting to dive<br />\ndown again in an effort to get out<br /><br />\nmy rubber boat and emergency gear.<br />\nBut it never did rise. The rough sea<br />\ntore the bags away, and, as the plane<br />\nsank from under me, I scrambled<br />\nalong the wing in time to catch one<br />\nof the bags and hang on.<br />\n\"Airplanes that I had not seen before were buzzing around. I noticed<br />\none fellow in a fighter staggering<br />\nabout in a .brave effort to do something. Probably he was trying to get<br />\nout his life raft to drop to me, but<br />\nhe couldn't quite make it. A bomber<br />\npilot circled low to try his luck in<br />\nthe dramatic rescue. First I thought<br />\nhe was going to land beside me, then<br />\n1 saw one of the mechanics out on<br />\nthe wing pulling off some of the<br />\ncowling; he was getting out his rubber boat to drop to me. Would he inflate it first, then heave it over?<br />\n\"If he should, I thought my chance<br />\nof getting to it would be small, because the wind might blow it away.<br />\nAround again he came, this time<br />\nlower and slower; and when right<br />\nclose by, he heaved it over.
