First, if the<br />\nfaculty prepared their book lists<br />\nearlier, or at least on time,<br />\nstudents could select their<br />\ncourses more intelligently, not<br />\nrelying on a mere two-sentence<br />\ndescription in a catalog. Also, if<br />\nthese lists were available at the<br />\nend of November, coinciding<br />\nwith the release of the second<br />\nsemester course schedule, people<br />\nwould have time to get books<br />\nfrom home during Christmas<br />\nvacation or find books at<br />\nlocations other than the<br />\nBookcenter.<br />\nThere are four bookstores in<br />\nthe immediate area, St. Paul<br />\nBookfair, Thirty-First St. Shop,<br />\nGach's and Allen's, which often<br />\nhave the books required in<br />\nnumerous courses for sometimes<br />\na fraction of the Bookcenter's<br />\nprices. Faculty could advise<br />\nstudents on the first day of class<br />\nthat less expensive texts are<br />\navailable elsewhere.

It<br />\nconcluded that lower SAT scores<br />\nare indicative of a regression in<br />\nstudent intelligence. I maintain<br />\nthere are a number of aspects to<br />\nconsider, aside from lack of<br />\nability, to explain the lower<br />\nscores.<br />\nThe impact of television has<br />\nperverted the English language<br />\nwithout the public's realization.<br />\nThe news media twist words<br />\nbeyond their intrinsic meaning<br />\nconsistently and the viewer is<br />\n<br />\nexposed to this mode of<br />\ncommunication daily. Consider<br />\nthe use of the word \"infer\" in<br />\nthe place of the word \"imply.\"<br />\nSome newsmen use these two<br />\nwords interchangeably although<br />\nthey are not synonymous.<br />\nToday's bestsellers merely extend<br />\nand reflect television's<br />\ncharacteristics with their<br />\nconvoluted, \"telegenic\" styles.<br />\nIn-depth character development<br />\nhas given way to a \"flash-back\"<br />\nformat in writing. Scores are<br />\nbound to be higher overall at<br />\nHopkins than at, say, the<br />\nUniversity of Oklahoma, but all<br />\nstudent suffer the effects of this<br />\n\"neo-writing.\"<br />\nAside from these<br />\n<br />\nenvironmental factors which<br />\ncollaborate in bringing down<br />\nSAT scores, there exists a more<br />\npersonal facet to consider. We are<br />\nbecoming creatures of keener<br />\nreasoning. Teachers, as well as<br />\nstudents, have found some<br />\nanswers in the practice SAT tests<br />\ndebatable; especially in the<br />\nVerbal section which is showing a<br />\nmore drastic decline in score<br />\nmeans. It is conceivable that one<br />\ncould persuade oneself away<br />\nfrom the alleged \"correct\"<br />\nresponse. Point of fact: .when<br />\ntaking a practice SAT test a<br />\ncouple of years ago, I was<br />\ninstructed to pick a word in five<br />\ngiven choices most nearly the<br />\nsame in meaning as a word given<br />\n<br />\nGOP<br />\n<br />\noriginally. That word was \"mass\"<br />\nand I was inclined to answer with<br />\nthe choice of \"weight.\" On<br />\nfurther inspection I saw the fifth<br />\nchoice was \"none of the above.\"<br />\nHaving learned at some point in<br />\nmy lowly science career that<br />\n\"mass\" and \"weight\" are not<br />\nsynonymous, I picked that fifth<br />\nresponse. I tried to outguess the<br />\ntest and came up with an<br />\nincorrect answer!<br />\nWith today's vogue in writing,<br />\npublic dependence in televion<br />\n(and newspaper headlines) for<br />\ninformation, and a generally<br />\nincisive approach to facile<br />\nquestions\u2014do the lower SAT<br />\nscores necessarily indicate lower<br />\nintelligence?

Perhaps the most popular is the<br />\n\"convergence\" myth, whereby detente is<br />\nperceived to be the force by which the<br />\nSoviet Union is to be liberalized and the<br />\nnations of the Atlantic community are to<br />\nbecome increasingly socialized. The<br />\nmerits a dangers of the latter' will not be<br />\naddressed here. However, disapproval of<br />\nthe liberalization leg upon which this<br />\nmyth rests will be sufficient to collapse at<br />\nleast this one chimera about detente.<br />\nAlso, it may serve to put a damper on<br />\nmany of the other inflated claims for<br />\ndetente.<br />\nThe necessity for detente in the eyes of<br />\nLeonid Brezhnev is extremely logical.<br />\nWhereas our motivations revolve around a<br />\nconcern for the world as we would like it<br />\nto be: peaceful, balanced, convergent,<br />\netc., Brezhnev is attempting to use<br />\ndetente to solve some very concrete<br />\npolitical problems. The Soviets believe<br />\nthe Chinese at this time to be the greatest<br />\nthreat to their security not only in terms<br />\nof a convential or nuclear war, but also in<br />\nview of the instability the Chinese could<br />\nengender in those Soviet territories on the<br />\nChinese border. The gradual acceptance<br />\nby the Western bloc of the East European<br />\nstatus quo, in which the Soviets have had<br />\na continual interest, culminated in the<br />\nrecent Helsinki Accord.<br />\nThe problem of the East European<br />\nstatus quo is not the only thing affected<br />\nby the \"Chamberlainesque\" performance<br />\nof Ford and Kissinger in Finland. This<br />\nagreement is viewed by many Soviets and<br />\nEast European dissidents, as well as<br />\nWestern conservatives, as a signal of<br />\ngeneral acceptance of the \"Brezhnev<br />\nDoctrine.\" This strategy in essesnce<br />\nallows Soviet intervention in Eastern<br />\nEurope to \"preserve socialism.\" Socialism<br />\nwas \"preserved\" in East Germany in<br />\n. in Hungary in 1956, and in<br />\n1953,<br />\nCzechoslovakia in 1968.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that the<br />\n\"preserver\" of socialism during the East<br />\nGerman worker's uprising in 1953, Adrei<br />\nGrechko, is now the head of the Soviet<br />\nArmed Forces and is a member of the<br />\nPolitburo of the Soviet Union<br />\nCommunity Party, the committee which<br />\nrules the Soviet Union. Another \"hero of<br />\nsocialist preservation\" is Yuri Andropov,<br />\nwho is a member of the Politburo and the<br />\nhead of the Soviet internal security and<br />\nespionage apparatus, the KGB. Andropov<br />\nwas ambassador to Hungary from 1954 to<br />\n1957.<br />\nThe \"Brezhnev Doctrine\" reserves the<br />\nright to defend Eastern Europe from<br />\n\"subversive Western influence\" such as<br />\nfreedom of movement and<br />\ncommunication which, while included in<br />\nthe Helsinki Accord, were in fact<br />\ngeneralized out of existence.<br />\nMore important though, the \"Brezhnev<br />\nDoctrine\" reserves the right to exert<br />\nSoviet influence in Western Europe.<br />\nPortugal, a NATO country, is an obvious<br />\nexample. This policy is sometimes<br />\nironically referred to as \"Finlandization.\"<br />\nIt is entirely consistent with the Soviet<br />\nconception of detente as having<br />\n\"significance only for 'relations between<br />\nstates',\" I and having \"no bearing on<br />\ncontinuing Soviet support for<br />\nanti-Western forces within other states.\"<br />\nIn reality the Soviet Union has gained<br />\nvery substantiftlly on the!international<br />\nlevel in return for some very intangible<br />\nassurances concerning civil rights. The<br />\nquestion of the self determination of<br />\ncountries such as the Baltic States was<br />\nnot even broached at the Helsinki<br />\nConference, much less Soviet expansions<br />\nin other parts of the world.<br />\nThe second basic problem which<br />\n<br />\nBrezhnev faces is the inability of the<br />\nSoviet system to meet the rising material<br />\nexpectations of the broad base of Soviet<br />\nsociety with either the present or<br />\nprojected productive ability of the Soviet<br />\neconomy. This problem calls for one of<br />\ntwo solutions. Either the Soviet Union<br />\ncould radically alter its highly centralized<br />\nand coercive economic and governmental<br />\nsystem to make it more efficient and<br />\nmore answerable to consumer demands or<br />\nit could attempt to import Western<br />\nconsumptive and capital goods and<br />\ntechnology. The latter course is known in<br />\nRussia as \"Computer Communism\" or<br />\n\"Stalinism with Computers.\"<br />\n<br />\nBefore discussing the costs of both<br />\noptions,Ithe assumption that the Soviet<br />\neconomy in and of itself can expand and<br />\nsatisfy the outgrowing demands placed<br />\nupon it should be exposed. In fact the<br />\nrate of growth in industrial productivity<br />\nhas been falling steadily in the last twenty<br />\nyears. As noted Soviet scientists Sakharov<br />\nand Medvedev have pointed out, there is<br />\nan \"essential and ever-growing gap<br />\nbetween our country and the West<br />\nextending through the entire spectrum of<br />\nscientific-technological activity.\"<br />\nStagnation is not restricted to the<br />\nindustrial sector, as is indicated by the<br />\nsize and incidence of grain purchases<br />\n<br />\nWe shall not forget<br />\nThe recent death of Dr. Hillard Berger<br />\nincites me to write on a topic that will<br />\neventually touch us all.<br />\nBecause we are human we will die.<br />\nSomeday. If we are lucky our end will be<br />\nquick, hopefully happening during sleep.<br />\nOthers will have to endure an arduous<br />\nbout with a terminal illness whose<br />\noutcome will seem anticlimactic. But<br />\nwhatever the route, the end result will be<br />\nthe same: we shall all be snapped from<br />\nlife, leaving friends, lovers, and children<br />\nbehind, crying.<br />\nWhen we are young and the days are<br />\nsunny, it is perhaps inappropriate to<br />\nconsider our' mortality. Yet mortal we<br />\nare, vulnerable to death, the sole<br />\nequalizer of men. In one way, death is<br />\nintrinsically apolitical yet democratic\u2014it<br />\nknows no economic, racial or cultural<br />\nbias\u2014it prefers everyone. It is not swayed<br />\noy need or intellectual promise, it does<br />\nnot seem reasonable, and I believe it is<br />\nsomewhat vain to even hypothesize on its<br />\nnature. But for personal reasons I feel<br />\ncompelled to write on this subject which<br />\nhas had such profound impact on this<br />\nstage of my development.<br />\nWhen someone you love dies, a part of<br />\nyou dies with him. But only a part. True,<br />\nthere is a time in life reserved for<br />\nmourning, but this emotion should not be<br />\nso all-encompassing that we deny<br />\nourselves the right to live our own lives<br />\nafter that time has passed. Ideally, the<br />\ndeath of one close should instill in us a<br />\nspecial verve, a heightened respect for all<br />\nthat continues to live, and a profound<br />\nappreciation of life for life's sake.<br />\nIndeed, I have found that death brings<br />\nout the humanity in man. At no other<br />\ntime in life does compassion flow so<br />\nfreely and with such genuine intent than<br />\nit does when death strikes a family. For a<br />\n<br />\nwhile, the apparently vile world that<br />\nrobbed you of a dear companion becomes<br />\nan old friend, nourishing you with<br />\nmemories of happier times. You realize<br />\nhow enriched you are by the dead one;<br />\nyou may even choose to pursue his ethic.<br />\nAnd in a sense, this course cannot be<br />\navoided, since that person is an<br />\ninseparable component of your own<br />\nbeing.<br />\nDeath brings a flood of sympathy.<br />\nThough it may seem impotent\u2014it cannot<br />\nrestore a life\u2014in its pure form sympathy<br />\nis a vital buffer between the initial shock<br />\nof death and the reality of having to live<br />\nwith loss. For a few days, everyone is<br />\nyour friend, and no one is reluctant to<br />\noffer you all the assistance possible.<br />\nBut the real trial comes in the weeks<br />\nfollowing the funeral, when the<br />\ncondolences stop rolling in, when the<br />\nrelatives return hour, and the gap once filled<br />\nby the dead one remains vacant. Slowly<br />\nyou realize that death is the ultimate<br />\nGoodbye.<br />\nDeath is not necessarily evil. To the<br />\nincurably ill,it may be the answer to months<br />\nof prayer. It can mean relief from<br />\nexcruciating pain or ardent anxiety, but<br />\nwhenever it strikes\u2014in the battlefield or<br />\nto the innocent child\u2014it must be<br />\nacknowledged for its utter solemnity.<br />\nReflecting on the deaths of both my<br />\nparents, I cannot believe that something<br />\nas intrinsically fascinating and beautiful<br />\nas life can end abruptly at death. There<br />\nmust be a continuance, some, form of<br />\nspiritual perpetuation. But I will never<br />\nknow for sure until my final hour. It is<br />\nthis mystery that will maintain death as<br />\nthe final taboo: no one has ever returned<br />\nfrom the dead except for one person.<br />\nAnd even then it was not long before He<br />\nreturned to the celestial necropolis when<br />\nHe came.<br />\n<br />\nfrom the U.S. In fact, Soviet agricultural<br />\nworkers are only one-sixth as productive<br />\nas American farmers.<br />\nThe radical alteration of the Soviet<br />\neconomy would entail three things. It<br />\nwould divert a great deal of investment<br />\naway from the expansion of conventional<br />\nmilitary capacity which is now going on<br />\nat a tremendous rate relative to the U.S.<br />\nIt would require a radical reorganization<br />\nof the Soviet governmental bureaucracy.<br />\nAnd it would entail a tacit admission that<br />\nthere was something wrong with the<br />\nsystem and by implication would detract<br />\nfrom the legitimacy of the Party in the<br />\neyes of the people and from its ability to<br />\ncontrol Soviet society.<br />\nThe first step is opposed by the<br />\nmilitary for reasons familiar to most<br />\nAmericans. The second would place the<br />\nsecure position of the Soviet bureaucracy<br />\nin jeopardy, which when attempted by<br />\nKrushchev, contributed to his ouster. The<br />\nthird would require the partial<br />\ndismantling of the coercive organs of the<br />\nSoviet state which have an interest in<br />\ntheir own preservation as is notably<br />\npointed out in Solzhenitsyn's Gulag<br />\nArchipelago. Not only do they possess<br />\nthe universal bureaucratic trait of<br />\nself-preservation, but they also represent<br />\nthe most ideologically motivated of<br />\nSoviet institutions. For them any<br />\ndecentralization of the socialist state, any<br />\nloosening of control, is, in Andropov's<br />\nwords, \"the undermining of Soviet power<br />\nfrom within.\"<br />\nUnable to pursue the radical course<br />\nbecause opposition from the three most<br />\npowerful groups in the Soviet government<br />\nwould be political suicide for him,<br />\nBrezhnev is engaged in a political<br />\ntightrope act which we call detente.<br />\nDetente, especially the trade and<br />\ninvestment opportunities, allows the<br />\nSoviet government to balance the<br />\nmaterial aspirations of the society while<br />\nalso satisfying the demands of the major<br />\ngovernmental interest groups.<br />\nImplicit in this formula is not the<br />\n\"liberalization\" of Soviet society, but<br />\nrather the strengthening of a system,<br />\neconomic and political, which is having<br />\ndifficulty standing on its own two feet. In<br />\nfact the indications are that from an<br />\norganizational standpoint, control over<br />\nthe society is being strengthened and even<br />\nmore centralized, i.e. totalized. This<br />\nmovement, termed \"neo-Stalinization,\" is<br />\nunderscored by the growing gulf between<br />\nParty members and the rest of the<br />\npopulace, by the superficial or<br />\ncentralizing nature of most<br />\nreorganization, by the increasing<br />\nsuppression of the intelligentsia and of<br />\nnon-Russian nationalities, by the<br />\nincreasing population of the Central<br />\nCommittee of the Part with military and<br />\nKGB personnel, and by the piore<br />\nfavorable regard in which Stalin is today<br />\nbeing held.<br />\nThese domestic implications of detente<br />\ncan be viewed and are viewed by<br />\ndissidents in Eastern Europe as an<br />\noutgrowth of the generally uncritical<br />\nattitude towards detente on Soviet terms<br />\nby Western leaders, media and business as<br />\nwell as political. A critical attitude<br />\ntowards detente should not be<br />\noverwhelmed by the Kissinger juggernaut<br />\nat the expense of our strategic security<br />\nand Russian civil rights. Alternatives,<br />\nbriefly stated here and largely ignored<br />\nelsewhere, would involve exacting more<br />\nfor our contribution to what is now<br />\nessentially an unbalanced trade-off or<br />\nassuming a policy of benign neglect<br />\ntowards the Soviet regime. Such a policy<br />\nmight eventually weaken it to the point<br />\nwhere it would be forced to change itself<br />\nor be overthrown.<br />\n<br />\n\fnovember 7, 1975/news-letter/page 3<br />\n<br />\nBuchanan and Hersh battle it out in Symposium<br />\n<br />\nti)<br />\n<br />\nPat Buchanan<br />\nBy KEN SOKOLOW<br />\n\"The chickens have come home to<br />\nroost,\" Pat Buchanan,speechwriter to the<br />\nconservative stars, maintained during a<br />\nmemorable debate with New York Times<br />\ninvestigative reporter Seymour Hersh as<br />\nthe M.S.E.

For<br />\nstarters, a good put-down is a funny<br />\nput-down. As you progress through life,<br />\nyou will soon learn the strategic<br />\nimportance of being funny. The ideal<br />\nput-down should leave the recipient<br />\ndoubled over in fits of laughter, which<br />\nwould allow time for you to run away<br />\n<br />\nPhosphate-free Morocco<br />\nSurely seems degradable<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\nAt the start of the semester<br />\nInternational Politics seemed Like a<br />\nPromising course\u2014finally an academic<br />\nsubject would be relevant to world<br />\naffairs. The course seemed to have filled<br />\nthat function admirably...until this week.<br />\nDuring the next few days in Northwest<br />\nAfrica, three countries\u2014Spain, Morocco,<br />\nand Algeria\u2014mays start 'shooting at one<br />\nanother over a territory named Spanish<br />\nSahara -a land with 18 times an many<br />\ncamels as cars. For all my knowledge of<br />\nsecurity imperatives, balance of power,<br />\nand mutual deterrence, I can't<br />\nimagine why any of these nations would<br />\ncovet an area whose agriculture consists<br />\nof 770 palm trees.<br />\nFirst,some historical background may<br />\nPut the current situation in perspective.<br />\nSpanish Sahara is the last of what was<br />\nonce a far-flung Spanish empire. Now<br />\nSpain, under pressure from Third World<br />\nnations in the U.N. as well as rising costs<br />\nof maintaining this colony, is prepared<br />\nto give the Sahara autonomy.<br />\nHowever,. Morocco, since gaining<br />\nindependence in the 1950's, has pressed<br />\nfor control of the area. King Hassan II has<br />\ncontended that his nation not only has a<br />\nright to Spanish colonies, but also that the<br />\ninhabitants of these states seek Moroccan<br />\nProtection.<br />\n-Looking carefully, however, it seems<br />\nunlikely that most natives of Spanish<br />\nSahara want anything more than a little<br />\ngrazing area. The 74,000 Sahaouis<br />\ntribesmen are basically a nomadic people,<br />\n<br />\ndependent on the small amount of<br />\npastureland for feeding their herds and<br />\nproviding a livelihood. One can hardly<br />\nbelieve that the Spanish Saharans could<br />\ncare one way or another if their political<br />\nmasters are Moroccan or Spanish.<br />\nWhy then do the respective countries<br />\ninsist that each must maintain a modicum<br />\nof control over a veritable desert? The<br />\nanswer lies in two words: phosphate and<br />\nprestige. One must note that under those<br />\nsand dunes lies an estimated two billion<br />\ntons of phosphate (NY Times, Nov. 6).<br />\nGaining access to this mine is especially<br />\ndesirable in view of the fact the price per<br />\nton of the resource jumped from $42 in<br />\n1973 to $63 in 1974.<br />\nMoreover, Hassan planned this \"civilian<br />\nmarch\" to stress the strength of his<br />\ncontinually threatened government.<br />\nFurthermore, it is staged at a time when<br />\nthe Spaniards are tied up in their own<br />\nproblems of political leadership. Yet,<br />\nJuan Carlos, Franco's apparent successor,<br />\nwould like to prove his is a true guardian<br />\nof national honor by defending this last<br />\nvestige of the Spanish empire. From the<br />\nwire service photographs, the scene in<br />\nMorocco resembles a picnic; in Spanish<br />\nSahara, an armed camp.<br />\nHow the king expects that the<br />\npilgrim age will defeat the Spanish<br />\nmili.tary I'll never know. The outcome of<br />\nthe whole affair could be a war between<br />\nMorocco and the alliance of Spain and<br />\nAlgeria. It seems everyone wants to do<br />\nwhat's best for the local residents...except<br />\nto leave them to their grazing.<br />\n<br />\nbefore he kills you.<br />\nAlso it is important to remember that<br />\ninherent in all put-downs is a cultural<br />\nsuperiority assumption. You must assume<br />\nthat the put-down ridicules the values of<br />\nthe put-downee. But be sure he<br />\nunderstands that you are scornful. Many<br />\na put-down have failed because the victim<br />\ntook them for compliments.<br />\nAlso be sure you do not go over his<br />\nhead. It is highly admirable to banter<br />\nabout quotes in Attic Greek, especially if<br />\nthey cut like a razor. But if the intended<br />\nthinks that you're cursing at'him, he will<br />\nquite possibly take violent action,<br />\nbeginning with your head.<br />\nVARIOUS STYLES<br />\nOne of the most popular modes of the<br />\nput-down is the\"You are so incredibly<br />\nstupid that...\" approach.<br />\nThere are several things to keep in<br />\nmind.1. Do not use this on professors,<br />\ngrad students, or other individuals who<br />\nhave more than ample opportunity to<br />\nshow you how stupid you are. 2. Try not<br />\not use this on \"dumb jocks.\" Although<br />\nmany of them seem to be hoarding<br />\nstupidity, they are generally adept at<br />\nrunning, lifting and throwing things, and<br />\nhave been known to do vast physical<br />\nharm at times.<br />\nAnother equally popular means of<br />\nhumorously expressing your hostility is<br />\nthe \"You are so ugly that...\" theme.<br />\nSome nice completions will include:<br />\n\"that your dog prefers strangers,\" \"you<br />\ncould open a branch office of ugly in<br />\nsomeone else's body,\" or (my favorite),<br />\n\"you are so ugly that John Waters barfs<br />\nwhen he sees you.\"<br />\nIt would be advisable that you refrain<br />\nfrom using this mode if you have ever<br />\nbeen confused with a dog, as the results<br />\ncould be less than desirable.<br />\nAND DON'T FORGET<br />\nWhen amongst the suave, sophisticated<br />\nand elite, in other words, those wh<br />\nwould not pursue you for a trifling insult<br />\na very subtle remark may arouse them t<br />\ngreat heights of exasperation.

Now I wasn't there, of<br />\ncourse, and I'm depending on the day<br />\neditor's indecipherable notes td write this<br />\nthing, but I can just imagine the righteous<br />\nfuror Buchanan provoked in the crowd.<br />\n\"Who was the greater threat ,to<br />\nnational security, the press or the Nixon<br />\nadministration the last five years?\" Sy<br />\nHersh asked the audience, after<br />\ncomparing listening to Buchanan with<br />\nentering a time warp. The man who broke<br />\nthe My Lai story and the C.I.A. Allende<br />\nhit caper went on to catalog Nixon's<br />\nunconstitutional escalations of the<br />\nSoutheast Asia conflict and his establishment<br />\nof a domestic espionage team (the<br />\n\"Plumbers\") which played havoc with the<br />\ncivil liberties of Americans, albeit in<br />\n\"Katzenjammer kids\" manner.<br />\nIn E. Howard Hunt's little-known<br />\nespionage romans-a-Oef lie the scenarios<br />\nfor the CIA's break-in operations around<br />\nthe world,' Hersh explained. Yet some<br />\npeople, namely Pat Buchanan and<br />\nGordon Liddy, \"didn't learn much from<br />\nthe whole process\" of Watergate.<br />\nHersh praised the advocacy journalism<br />\ndenounced by Buchanan as \"the objective<br />\ndetermination of the press that there is a<br />\nright and wrong\u2014and we were wrong in<br />\nVietnam.\" In his view, the \"broad<br />\nmajority which makes this country run<br />\nanyway\" came to a rational decision that<br />\nthe war was wrong on the basis of the<br />\nevidence presented to them; it was not a<br />\ncase of sinister press propagnda.<br />\nSy Hersh spoke very rapidly and<br />\nconstantly interrupted his sentences in<br />\nmid-stream as a new thought struck him.<br />\nThis style of delivery and his ready wit<br />\nled one member of the audience to liken<br />\nHersh to humorist Woody Allen.<br />\nBuchanan was given five minutes for<br />\nrebuttal. He held his previous ground and<br />\nstated that Hersh's emotionalism and<br />\nvalue judgements just went to prove his<br />\nown points; \"Hersh is the type of New<br />\nJ ournalist we have in America.\" He<br />\ndefended the Nixon administration's<br />\nVietnam policy, including the bombing of<br />\nCambodia, which he considered a good<br />\nmilitary tactic. Buchanan also accused the<br />\nKhmer Rouge\u2014\"the heroes of the<br />\npress\"\u2014of committing genocide against<br />\nthe Cambodian people. The former Nixon<br />\nspeechwriter, who is now a correspondent<br />\nfor the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, said<br />\nthat he had come to Hopkins to discuss<br />\nthe present state of journalism but that<br />\nMr. Hersh -had injected the irrelevant<br />\nVietnam issue into the debate.<br />\nThe only attitudes shared by both<br />\nspeakers were a belief that columnist Jack<br />\nAnderson should not have received a<br />\nPulitzer prize for publishing leaked<br />\nclassified documents (Hersh: \"That<br />\nbothers me about our business\") and an<br />\nadmiration for the literary style and acute<br />\nperception of Dr. Hunter S.

It is<br />\nlikely that the same attempts to<br />\nstrengthen it, on the one hand, and<br />\nabolish it altogether, on the other, will be<br />\nattempted again this year.<br />\nStatistics from the Registrar's office<br />\nindicate that for the fourth year in a row<br />\nthe number of course offerings has<br />\ndeclined. Thus far, only 30 courses, not<br />\nincluding independent research and<br />\nstudies, will be offered this year. Officials<br />\nin the Registrar's office do not anticipate<br />\nthat many more will be added, although<br />\nthe possibility still exists.<br />\nThirteen of the 27 Homewood<br />\nacademic departments are not offering<br />\nany courses, although many will sponsor<br />\nindependent projects for credit.<br />\nLast year 77 courses were given, 84 the<br />\nyear before, and 85 the year before that.<br />\nDepartments offered 22 independent<br />\nstudy courses in the 1974 Intersession.<br />\nThere were 1039 course enrollments last<br />\nyear, and 1137 the year before that.<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences George<br />\nOwen said he is not at all satisfied with<br />\nthe offerings thus far and pledged to<br />\napply more pressure to departments to<br />\nincrease the number of Intersession<br />\ncourses.<br />\nDr. Sigmund Suskind, Dean of<br />\nGraduate and Undergraduate Studies,<br />\nagreed with Owen that the number of<br />\ncourses scheduled thus far will not make<br />\n4A.:4c><br />\n46\"/<br />\n1<br />\n49.446`\"4:<br />\n16Px49<br />\n'<br />\nPx49<br />\n'<br />\nWould you like to<br />\n<br />\nfor a productive Intersessions, and said he<br />\nhas \"gently prodded\" the departments to<br />\nincrease their offerings.<br />\nBut both Deans admitted that little<br />\npressure has been exerted on the<br />\ndepartments to beef up their offerings,<br />\nand they indicated that they will not do<br />\nthat much more now to bolster the<br />\nnumber of offerings. Owen did promise,<br />\nthough, to tali: to the chairmen of the<br />\ndepartments not offering any scheduled<br />\nIntersession courses.<br />\nThe Deans' reluctance to pressure the<br />\nfaculty into greater participation stems<br />\nfrom the long-standing opposition to the<br />\nwinter program of a certain portion of<br />\nthe faculty.<br />\nThe faculty has argued in the past that<br />\nIntersession was set up six years ago as a<br />\nstrictly voluntary program. To require or<br />\ncoerce faculty into teaching would violate<br />\nthat \"contract,\" they contend. Much of<br />\nthe faculty maintains that if they are<br />\nasked to increase their teaching load they<br />\nshould be compensated accordingly.<br />\nBoth Owen and Suskind asserted that<br />\nthese faculty claims are justified.<br />\nMoreover, they both underscored<br />\nyesterday their belief that Intersession is<br />\nnot a quality academic program and that<br />\nthey personally favor reverting back to a<br />\ntwo-semester system with extended<br />\nreading periods.<br />\nThe University presently operates<br />\nofficially under a \"4-0-4\" system,<br />\nalthough the maintenance of credit<br />\ncourses between semester implies a<br />\n\"4-14\" set-up.<br />\nSuskind commented, \"I would<br />\n\u2022\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nconsider Intersession a weak program. I<br />\nwill not make any mandatory rules that<br />\ncourses must be taught.\"<br />\nStudent and faculty sentiment over<br />\nIntersession has traditionally been mixed.<br />\nMost students favor the program in its<br />\npresent form, as indicated by results of a<br />\nsurvey taken in 1973, where 820 out of<br />\n820 students approved the retention of<br />\nthe program as is.<br />\nThe faculty, however, is quite divided.<br />\nMany believe that Intersession should be<br />\nmade into a non-credit program. Members<br />\nof the Math Department made such a<br />\nproposal to the faculty General Assembly<br />\nlast year and almost succeeded because<br />\nthe Mathematics departments had<br />\n\"stacked\" the meeting with its faculty.<br />\n<br />\nOnly 50 faculty were in attendance.<br />\nThe majority of faculty, though,<br />\nprobably support Intersession, and for<br />\nmuch the same reasons that students<br />\ndo\u2014its freedom and flexibility. The<br />\nproblem is that the faculty feel they<br />\nneeded the time to prepare for classes, do<br />\ntheir research, or take a vacation rather<br />\nthan for teaching a course.<br />\nThe students, while wanting to<br />\nmaintain the freedom that the, current<br />\nsystem provides, have indicated that the<br />\ncourse offerings in Intersession are<br />\ninadequate\u2014if not worse\u2014and want the<br />\nofferings beefed up.<br />\nSince definitive action on this problem<br />\nhas not come in the past\u2014nor is it likely<br />\nsee INTERSESSION, page 7<br />\n<br />\nDr. Sigmund Suskind<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 .\u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\nstudy in Norway?<br />\nOne of the best summer programs<br />\noffered anywhere is the<br />\nUNIVERSITY OF OSLO<br />\nINTERNATIONAL<br />\nSUMMER SCHOOL<br />\nJune 26 to August 6, 1975<br />\nUNDERGRADUATE<br />\nAND<br />\nGRADUATE COURSES<br />\nTwo years of college required<br />\nFor complete catalog<br />\nplease write to<br />\nOslo Summer School<br />\nc/o St. Olaf College<br />\nNorthfield, Minnesota 55057 USA<br />\n<br />\nFOR SALE: Dottie's historical VW<br />\n(complete with canoe paddle), as is,<br />\n$200 (1967).

One<br />\none hand, some twenty million men and<br />\nwomen spend millions a year for the sake<br />\nof a sport which they pursue with the<br />\ndedication of aficionados at Pamplona.<br />\nOn the other, hunting is reviled by a not<br />\nnegligible portion of our population as<br />\nwasteful, sadistic, and-anachronistic: the<br />\ncommercialized, debased, and organized<br />\nSlaughter of wildlife heritage.<br />\nVisions of challenging, uniting, and<br />\nc ommunicating with nature diverge<br />\nradically from imagined scenes in which<br />\nherds of blood-thirsty atavists encircle<br />\nand exterminate the remaining fifty<br />\nrabbits extant in the United States. From<br />\nthe latter perspective, one need only<br />\ntraverse the Hopkins campus and view<br />\nSquirrels peacefully hiding nuts for<br />\nwinter, and mix expressions of relief at<br />\ntheir safety only with rage directed at the<br />\n<br />\nwar-surplus goods.<br />\nThe documentary reiterated what is<br />\nincreasingly obvious: a neutral set of facts<br />\nconcerning the multi-faceted issue of<br />\ngame-animal killing, and the people, land,<br />\nanimals, and industry involved, is<br />\nincreasingly hard to come by. At one<br />\nextreme looms the National Rifle<br />\nAssociation, not exactly acclaimed for its<br />\nexpanded mentality and enlightened<br />\napproach to anything, and at the other<br />\nare people who despise hunting, are afraid<br />\nof guns, and regard the sport as a feeble<br />\neffort to reassert, by means of bullying<br />\nand slaughtering helpless animals, a<br />\nmythological machine badly damaged by<br />\nWomen's Liberation. They equate hunters<br />\nwith law-and-order Wallace supporters,<br />\nand are also usually uninformed about<br />\nmost aSpects of hunting and certainly<br />\ncannot understand how any decent<br />\nhuman being could achieve any<br />\ngratification through such an activity.<br />\nThus, those who are most knowledgeable<br />\nabout hunting seem to be too prejudiced<br />\nin its favor to make unbiased comments<br />\nconcerning it, and those whose<br />\n<br />\nindividuals who prey on American game<br />\nanimals.<br />\nOn September 5, 1975, CBS<br />\nbroadcasted a ninety-minute special<br />\nentitled \"The Guns of Autumn,\" which,<br />\nif lacking in impartiality and rational<br />\njudgement, managed to transmogrify<br />\nhunters into bloodthirsty inebriates for<br />\nwhom alone the death penalty should be<br />\nrestored. The program obviously<br />\nabandoned, if indeed it ever considered, a<br />\nbalanced objective approach to hunting in<br />\nAmerica for footage which, in its<br />\nportrayal of bears being shot out of trees<br />\nat a garbage dump and deer being shot on<br />\nhalf-a-grand-a-trophy game farms, and<br />\napparently attempted only to incite<br />\nunreasoning moral disgust. Shots of a<br />\nEuropean white fallow deer being<br />\n\"riddled\" by three rifle shells, and after<br />\nbeing dropped, by four or five bullets<br />\nfrom a German Luger, were not designed<br />\nto evoke admiration for the hunter. The<br />\nviewer may have been hard-pressed to<br />\ninterpret shots which caught billboards<br />\ndisplaying advertising information<br />\nconcerning hunting licenses, liquor, and<br />\n<br />\nknowledge of the sport, and experience<br />\nwith it, is the most limited, tend to<br />\noverrate the credibility of<br />\nyellow-journalism tidbits about the<br />\nvulgarity and rudeness of the \"average<br />\nhunter,\" at best regarding him as an<br />\nunhealthy entity in our land, a distorted<br />\nremnant'of a dim national past.<br />\nNo one is trying to deny, or at least no<br />\none should deny, the fact that there are<br />\nhunters who seem to have no grasp of<br />\nethics, disregard the property rights and<br />\nsafety of other individuals, flagrantly<br />\nbreak United States game-pursuit codes<br />\nwith malicious alacrity, and enjoy<br />\nexterminating as many animals of all<br />\ntypes as possible and leaving them to rot.<br />\nPerhaps it is the cardinal crime of the<br />\nhunting establishment that it fails to<br />\ncensor such individuals more harshly and<br />\neffectively.<br />\nHowever, to allow such slobs to<br />\nrepresent millions of hunters is perhaps<br />\nan equally deplorable miscarriage of<br />\njustice.

G. KNOWLES<br />\nAt the beginning of a, Monday night<br />\nfootball game eleven days ago, the<br />\nBuffalo Bills were on top of the world.<br />\n1975 was to be their season. The \"Juice\"<br />\nwas running wild. Ferguson was off to his<br />\nbest start as a pro. An atmosphere of<br />\nexuberant confidence was reflected in the<br />\nBills as \"the Mouth\" interviewed them.<br />\nThen the New York Giants incredibly<br />\nbeat them. Suddenly everything wasn't<br />\ncoming up roses anymore. The Miami<br />\nDolphins proceeded to trample all over<br />\nthe Bills' flower bed as they came from<br />\nbehind to beat the Bills in a game that<br />\nwas seemingly wrapped up in the first<br />\nquarter.<br />\nLast week only a sensational 64-yard<br />\npass reception by Simpson saved them<br />\nfrom a third straight defeat as they beat<br />\nthe Jets by a point.<br />\n<br />\nNow, halfway through the season, a<br />\ngame behind Miami, they must face the<br />\nprospects of taking on Cincinnatti. St.<br />\nLouis, and Miami on the road, plus a<br />\nseason finale with the Vikings, at home.<br />\nWhat all this adds up to is that Buffalo<br />\ncan't afford to lose again if they hope to<br />\nhave any kind of a shot at the playoffs.<br />\nThere's no way they can rely on the wild<br />\ncard berth that got them into last year's<br />\nplayoffs. Almost assuredly that spot will<br />\nbelong to one of the three teams involved<br />\nin the AFC Central Division dogfight.<br />\nThis is an unfortunate,perspective for<br />\nthe Baltimore Colts who are travelling up<br />\nto Buffalo this week in search of their<br />\nthird straight win and a chance to even up<br />\ntheir record at 4-4. That the Bills are a<br />\nvery good football team is somewhat of<br />\nan understatement, but for the most part,<br />\ntheir fortunes rest with Mr. Superstar,<br />\n<br />\nthe Bills make it<br />\n<br />\nO.J. Simpson.<br />\nContaining O.J. is not impossible, but<br />\nin so doing, a defense becomes extremely<br />\nvulnerable to other vastly improved<br />\naspects of the Bills offensive machine\u2014an<br />\nattack that totally subdued the world<br />\nchampion Steelers.<br />\nWhen Baltimore last played the Bills<br />\nfour weeks ago, middle linebacker Mike<br />\nCurtis keyed on Simpson's every move.<br />\nFor the first thirty minutes it worked<br />\npretty well. Ferguson though, capitalized<br />\non Baltimore's fascination with the<br />\n\"Juice\" and used play action passes to<br />\nopen up his passing game.<br />\nA fake pitch to Simpson as he moved<br />\nquickly outside served two purposes. It<br />\nwould either send the linebackers (and<br />\nparticularly Curtis) moving after Simpson<br />\nputting them out of position to stop a<br />\ncharging Jim Braxton, or else it acted as a<br />\n<br />\nGeorgetown succumbs to Jay Rooters<br />\nBy DAVID KRAUS<br />\nWith a . convincing 1-0 victory over<br />\nDivision I rival Georgetown Wednesday<br />\nafternoon at Homewood, the Blue Jay<br />\nVarsity Soccer team moved one step<br />\nCloser to a possible NCAA post-season<br />\nplayoff bid.<br />\nThe start of the game was delayed<br />\nnearly half an hour due to the late arrival<br />\nof the Hoyas. Once the contest did get<br />\nunderway, however, it appeared as<br />\nthough the visitors had left their offense<br />\nback on the Washington Beltway.<br />\nHopkins totally controlled the first<br />\nfifteen minutes of the match as they<br />\nbombarded the Georgetown goal with<br />\nShot after shot.

Gary<br />\nIgnatowski passed the ball to Greg<br />\nCunningham, who proceeded to dribble<br />\nPast several defenders and rifle a shot past<br />\nthe helpless Hoya netminder.<br />\nThe flow of play for the remainder of<br />\nthe half was very similar to the pattern<br />\nthat had already been established.<br />\nHopkins made the game appear to be a<br />\nhalf-field sc-rimmage to set up any scoring<br />\noPportunities. At halftime, the Jays held<br />\na 20-4 margin in shots on goal and goalie<br />\nSeusse had not been forced to make a<br />\nsave.<br />\nPlay resumed in the second forty-five<br />\n<br />\nminutes where it had left off after the<br />\nfirst. The Jays continued their shot<br />\nbarrage\u2014although they failed to add to<br />\ntheir lead\u2014and the defense continued its<br />\nstranglehold on the Hoyas offense.<br />\nFinal statistics showed Hopkins (now<br />\n9-1-1) with a 37-11 lead in shots and<br />\nSeusse making only three saves en route<br />\nto his fifth shutout of the season.<br />\nHomewood Coach Bob Oliver was<br />\npleased with the team's performance.<br />\n\"We dominated it [the game] in every<br />\naspect,\" he declared. \"We had plenty of<br />\nchances, but could only put the ball in<br />\nthe goal once.\"<br />\nThe coach had special plaudits for his<br />\ndefensive corps.<br />\n\"Ami Cohen did an admirable job,\"<br />\nOliver noted. \"Cazzy [Bruce Cazenave]<br />\ndid a fine job as our rover back and Lou<br />\n[Podrazik] and Frank [Olszewski]<br />\nplayed very steady games.\"<br />\nThe victory, however, does not assure<br />\nthe Blue Jays of an NCAA tournament<br />\nbid.

When you're winning\u2014never,<br />\nbut when you're 1-4-1 you'll try<br />\nanything.<br />\nActually the move by Hopkins Head<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox, prior to last week's<br />\n40-20 loss at Moravian, was not all that<br />\nradical, especially when the newcomer<br />\nhas the credentials of new Blue Jay field<br />\ngeneral, Tom Bender.<br />\nIncumbent signal-caller Dave Emala<br />\nwas moved to wing-back in order to take<br />\nadvantage of his fine speed and excellent<br />\nhands which make him an ideal wide<br />\nreceiver and the perfect complement to<br />\nSplit end Joey Devlin, the Jays' other fine<br />\nWide receiver. With aerial threats now<br />\ncoming at them from both sides,<br />\nHomewood opponents can no longer<br />\nconcentrate their coverage on Devlin<br />\nalone.<br />\nThat left the quarterback throne<br />\nvacant and Cox went with Bender at the<br />\nhelm. The freshman from Loyola had<br />\n<br />\nimpeccable qualifications, having been<br />\nselected First Team All-State QB in his<br />\nsenior year. As a sophomore, Bender took<br />\nover for the injured Dan Dullea(now star<br />\nsignal-caller at Towson State) with no<br />\napparent drop-off in talent.<br />\n\"I wanted to go to school for an<br />\neducation first, but also play football,\"<br />\ncommented the social and behavioral<br />\nsciences major,\"and I could do both here<br />\nat Hopkins.\"<br />\n\"Granted the football here is Division<br />\nIII, low pressure, but I was really<br />\nsurprised by the high quality of the<br />\nprogram and the team.\"<br />\n\"The attitude around here is really<br />\ngreat,also,\" Bender continued, \"because<br />\neveryone is playing football because they<br />\nwant to, because they like to; not because<br />\nthey have to!\"<br />\n\"Like Saturday, I was a little nervous<br />\nbut because the team had gone up the<br />\nday before, we all got a little closer, got<br />\nto know each other better and that gave<br />\nme more confidence so that when game<br />\n<br />\n\"freeze\" to give the receivers a vital<br />\nsecond to get open in the Colt secondary.<br />\nSince then Curtis has been injured, and<br />\nhis replacement, Jim Cheyunski, has been<br />\nimpressive. Cheyunslci came over from<br />\nthe Bills earlier in the season, so he<br />\nshouldn't have much trouble getting up.<br />\nfor his old teammates. Stan White, the<br />\noutside linebacker, has also looked good,<br />\nand he'll be calling the defensive signals<br />\non Sunday.<br />\nAnother addition since the Buffalo<br />\ngame is cornerback Lloyd Mumphord,who<br />\ncomes from the. Dolphins. The Colt<br />\ndefense is far from being considers one of<br />\nsolid NFL calibre, nevertheless it does<br />\nshow tremendous potential.<br />\nThey'll have to work out a finely tuned<br />\nbalance against the Bills. They have to<br />\nmake O.J. \"earn his 100 yards\" as Coach<br />\nMarchibroda said. But a balance must be<br />\nmaintained between keying on Simpson<br />\ntoo much, and not keying on him<br />\nenough. Too much weight on either side<br />\nwill destroy the equilibrium and could<br />\nmake it easy for the Bills to get out of<br />\nhand.<br />\nThe Colts are very capable of getting a<br />\nlot of points on the scoreboard, although<br />\nthe bump-and-run tactics Buffalo<br />\nsometimes employs could give<br />\nquarterback Bert Jones some trouble. If<br />\nthat happens, Jones can go to his tight<br />\nend Raymond Chester, as he did against<br />\nthe Browns last week.<br />\nThere should be a lot of scoring in this<br />\ngame, the Colts are not yet up to the task<br />\nof containing the Bills, but their chances<br />\nof winning depend on the success of the<br />\ndefense, and to what extent the Colt<br />\ndefense can keep Baltimore in the game.<br />\n<br />\ntime rolled around, I wasn't really<br />\nworried.\"<br />\nEven though his initial effort as a<br />\ncollegiate quarterback did not result in a<br />\nvictory, Bender was nonetheless<br />\nimpressive, especially through the air. He<br />\nfired two scoring strikes, one a 38-yard<br />\nbomb to Emala, and the other a nine-yard<br />\ntoss to halfback Brett Miles in which,<br />\nwith his primary receivers covered,<br />\nBender exhibited poise in remaining in<br />\nthe pocket and hitting his safety valve<br />\ncoming out of the backfield for a score.<br />\nDespite the Blue Jays' disappointing<br />\nrecord thus far, Bender's optimism was<br />\napparent.<br />\nOffense Underrated<br />\n\"I think our offense is really<br />\nunderrated.

Also, if<br />\nthese lists were available at the<br />\nend of November, coinciding<br />\nwith the release of the second<br />\nsemester course schedule, people<br />\nwould have time to get books<br />\nfrom home during Christmas<br />\nvacation or find books at<br />\nlocations other than the<br />\nBookcenter.<br />\nThere are four bookstores in<br />\nthe immediate area, St. Paul<br />\nBookfair, Thirty-First St. Shop,<br />\nGach's and Allen's, which often<br />\nhave the books required in<br />\nnumerous courses for sometimes<br />\na fraction of the Bookcenter's<br />\nprices.

It<br />\nconcluded that lower SAT scores<br />\nare indicative of a regression in<br />\nstudent intelligence. I maintain<br />\nthere are a number of aspects to<br />\nconsider, aside from lack of<br />\nability, to explain the lower<br />\nscores.<br />\nThe impact of television has<br />\nperverted the English language<br />\nwithout the public's realization.<br />\nThe news media twist words<br />\nbeyond their intrinsic meaning<br />\nconsistently and the viewer is<br /><br />\nexposed to this mode of<br />\ncommunication daily. Consider<br />\nthe use of the word \"infer\" in<br />\nthe place of the word \"imply.\"<br />\nSome newsmen use these two<br />\nwords interchangeably although<br />\nthey are not synonymous.<br />\nToday's bestsellers merely extend<br />\nand reflect television's<br />\ncharacteristics with their<br />\nconvoluted, \"telegenic\" styles.<br />\nIn-depth character development<br />\nhas given way to a \"flash-back\"<br />\nformat in writing. Scores are<br />\nbound to be higher overall at<br />\nHopkins than at, say, the<br />\nUniversity of Oklahoma, but all<br />\nstudent suffer the effects of this<br />\n\"neo-writing.\"<br />\nAside from these<br /><br />\nenvironmental factors which<br />\ncollaborate in bringing down<br />\nSAT scores, there exists a more<br />\npersonal facet to consider. We are<br />\nbecoming creatures of keener<br />\nreasoning. Teachers, as well as<br />\nstudents, have found some<br />\nanswers in the practice SAT tests<br />\ndebatable; especially in the<br />\nVerbal section which is showing a<br />\nmore drastic decline in score<br />\nmeans. It is conceivable that one<br />\ncould persuade oneself away<br />\nfrom the alleged \"correct\"<br />\nresponse. Point of fact: .when<br />\ntaking a practice SAT test a<br />\ncouple of years ago, I was<br />\ninstructed to pick a word in five<br />\ngiven choices most nearly the<br />\nsame in meaning as a word given<br /><br />\nGOP<br /><br />\noriginally. That word was \"mass\"<br />\nand I was inclined to answer with<br />\nthe choice of \"weight.\" On<br />\nfurther inspection I saw the fifth<br />\nchoice was \"none of the above.\"<br />\nHaving learned at some point in<br />\nmy lowly science career that<br />\n\"mass\" and \"weight\" are not<br />\nsynonymous, I picked that fifth<br />\nresponse.

Perhaps the most popular is the<br />\n\"convergence\" myth, whereby detente is<br />\nperceived to be the force by which the<br />\nSoviet Union is to be liberalized and the<br />\nnations of the Atlantic community are to<br />\nbecome increasingly socialized. The<br />\nmerits a dangers of the latter' will not be<br />\naddressed here. However, disapproval of<br />\nthe liberalization leg upon which this<br />\nmyth rests will be sufficient to collapse at<br />\nleast this one chimera about detente.<br />\nAlso, it may serve to put a damper on<br />\nmany of the other inflated claims for<br />\ndetente.<br />\nThe necessity for detente in the eyes of<br />\nLeonid Brezhnev is extremely logical.<br />\nWhereas our motivations revolve around a<br />\nconcern for the world as we would like it<br />\nto be: peaceful, balanced, convergent,<br />\netc., Brezhnev is attempting to use<br />\ndetente to solve some very concrete<br />\npolitical problems. The Soviets believe<br />\nthe Chinese at this time to be the greatest<br />\nthreat to their security not only in terms<br />\nof a convential or nuclear war, but also in<br />\nview of the instability the Chinese could<br />\nengender in those Soviet territories on the<br />\nChinese border. The gradual acceptance<br />\nby the Western bloc of the East European<br />\nstatus quo, in which the Soviets have had<br />\na continual interest, culminated in the<br />\nrecent Helsinki Accord.<br />\nThe problem of the East European<br />\nstatus quo is not the only thing affected<br />\nby the \"Chamberlainesque\" performance<br />\nof Ford and Kissinger in Finland. This<br />\nagreement is viewed by many Soviets and<br />\nEast European dissidents, as well as<br />\nWestern conservatives, as a signal of<br />\ngeneral acceptance of the \"Brezhnev<br />\nDoctrine.\" This strategy in essesnce<br />\nallows Soviet intervention in Eastern<br />\nEurope to \"preserve socialism.\" Socialism<br />\nwas \"preserved\" in East Germany in<br />\n. in Hungary in 1956, and in<br />\n1953,<br />\nCzechoslovakia in 1968.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that the<br />\n\"preserver\" of socialism during the East<br />\nGerman worker's uprising in 1953, Adrei<br />\nGrechko, is now the head of the Soviet<br />\nArmed Forces and is a member of the<br />\nPolitburo of the Soviet Union<br />\nCommunity Party, the committee which<br />\nrules the Soviet Union. Another \"hero of<br />\nsocialist preservation\" is Yuri Andropov,<br />\nwho is a member of the Politburo and the<br />\nhead of the Soviet internal security and<br />\nespionage apparatus, the KGB. Andropov<br />\nwas ambassador to Hungary from 1954 to<br />\n1957.<br />\nThe \"Brezhnev Doctrine\" reserves the<br />\nright to defend Eastern Europe from<br />\n\"subversive Western influence\" such as<br />\nfreedom of movement and<br />\ncommunication which, while included in<br />\nthe Helsinki Accord, were in fact<br />\ngeneralized out of existence.<br />\nMore important though, the \"Brezhnev<br />\nDoctrine\" reserves the right to exert<br />\nSoviet influence in Western Europe.<br />\nPortugal, a NATO country, is an obvious<br />\nexample. This policy is sometimes<br />\nironically referred to as \"Finlandization.\"<br />\nIt is entirely consistent with the Soviet<br />\nconception of detente as having<br />\n\"significance only for 'relations between<br />\nstates',\" I and having \"no bearing on<br />\ncontinuing Soviet support for<br />\nanti-Western forces within other states.\"<br />\nIn reality the Soviet Union has gained<br />\nvery substantiftlly on the!international<br />\nlevel in return for some very intangible<br />\nassurances concerning civil rights. The<br />\nquestion of the self determination of<br />\ncountries such as the Baltic States was<br />\nnot even broached at the Helsinki<br />\nConference, much less Soviet expansions<br />\nin other parts of the world.<br />\nThe second basic problem which<br /><br />\nBrezhnev faces is the inability of the<br />\nSoviet system to meet the rising material<br />\nexpectations of the broad base of Soviet<br />\nsociety with either the present or<br />\nprojected productive ability of the Soviet<br />\neconomy. This problem calls for one of<br />\ntwo solutions. Either the Soviet Union<br />\ncould radically alter its highly centralized<br />\nand coercive economic and governmental<br />\nsystem to make it more efficient and<br />\nmore answerable to consumer demands or<br />\nit could attempt to import Western<br />\nconsumptive and capital goods and<br />\ntechnology. The latter course is known in<br />\nRussia as \"Computer Communism\" or<br />\n\"Stalinism with Computers.\"<br /><br />\nBefore discussing the costs of both<br />\noptions,Ithe assumption that the Soviet<br />\neconomy in and of itself can expand and<br />\nsatisfy the outgrowing demands placed<br />\nupon it should be exposed. In fact the<br />\nrate of growth in industrial productivity<br />\nhas been falling steadily in the last twenty<br />\nyears. As noted Soviet scientists Sakharov<br />\nand Medvedev have pointed out, there is<br />\nan \"essential and ever-growing gap<br />\nbetween our country and the West<br />\nextending through the entire spectrum of<br />\nscientific-technological activity.\"<br />\nStagnation is not restricted to the<br />\nindustrial sector, as is indicated by the<br />\nsize and incidence of grain purchases<br /><br />\nWe shall not forget<br />\nThe recent death of Dr. Hillard Berger<br />\nincites me to write on a topic that will<br />\neventually touch us all.<br />\nBecause we are human we will die.<br />\nSomeday. If we are lucky our end will be<br />\nquick, hopefully happening during sleep.<br />\nOthers will have to endure an arduous<br />\nbout with a terminal illness whose<br />\noutcome will seem anticlimactic. But<br />\nwhatever the route, the end result will be<br />\nthe same: we shall all be snapped from<br />\nlife, leaving friends, lovers, and children<br />\nbehind, crying.<br />\nWhen we are young and the days are<br />\nsunny, it is perhaps inappropriate to<br />\nconsider our' mortality. Yet mortal we<br />\nare, vulnerable to death, the sole<br />\nequalizer of men. In one way, death is<br />\nintrinsically apolitical yet democratic\u2014it<br />\nknows no economic, racial or cultural<br />\nbias\u2014it prefers everyone. It is not swayed<br />\noy need or intellectual promise, it does<br />\nnot seem reasonable, and I believe it is<br />\nsomewhat vain to even hypothesize on its<br />\nnature. But for personal reasons I feel<br />\ncompelled to write on this subject which<br />\nhas had such profound impact on this<br />\nstage of my development.<br />\nWhen someone you love dies, a part of<br />\nyou dies with him. But only a part. True,<br />\nthere is a time in life reserved for<br />\nmourning, but this emotion should not be<br />\nso all-encompassing that we deny<br />\nourselves the right to live our own lives<br />\nafter that time has passed. Ideally, the<br />\ndeath of one close should instill in us a<br />\nspecial verve, a heightened respect for all<br />\nthat continues to live, and a profound<br />\nappreciation of life for life's sake.<br />\nIndeed, I have found that death brings<br />\nout the humanity in man. At no other<br />\ntime in life does compassion flow so<br />\nfreely and with such genuine intent than<br />\nit does when death strikes a family. For a<br /><br />\nwhile, the apparently vile world that<br />\nrobbed you of a dear companion becomes<br />\nan old friend, nourishing you with<br />\nmemories of happier times. You realize<br />\nhow enriched you are by the dead one;<br />\nyou may even choose to pursue his ethic.<br />\nAnd in a sense, this course cannot be<br />\navoided, since that person is an<br />\ninseparable component of your own<br />\nbeing.<br />\nDeath brings a flood of sympathy.<br />\nThough it may seem impotent\u2014it cannot<br />\nrestore a life\u2014in its pure form sympathy<br />\nis a vital buffer between the initial shock<br />\nof death and the reality of having to live<br />\nwith loss. For a few days, everyone is<br />\nyour friend, and no one is reluctant to<br />\noffer you all the assistance possible.<br />\nBut the real trial comes in the weeks<br />\nfollowing the funeral, when the<br />\ncondolences stop rolling in, when the<br />\nrelatives return hour, and the gap once filled<br />\nby the dead one remains vacant. Slowly<br />\nyou realize that death is the ultimate<br />\nGoodbye.<br />\nDeath is not necessarily evil. To the<br />\nincurably ill,it may be the answer to months<br />\nof prayer. It can mean relief from<br />\nexcruciating pain or ardent anxiety, but<br />\nwhenever it strikes\u2014in the battlefield or<br />\nto the innocent child\u2014it must be<br />\nacknowledged for its utter solemnity.<br />\nReflecting on the deaths of both my<br />\nparents, I cannot believe that something<br />\nas intrinsically fascinating and beautiful<br />\nas life can end abruptly at death. There<br />\nmust be a continuance, some, form of<br />\nspiritual perpetuation. But I will never<br />\nknow for sure until my final hour. It is<br />\nthis mystery that will maintain death as<br />\nthe final taboo: no one has ever returned<br />\nfrom the dead except for one person.<br />\nAnd even then it was not long before He<br />\nreturned to the celestial necropolis when<br />\nHe came.<br /><br />\nfrom the U.S. In fact, Soviet agricultural<br />\nworkers are only one-sixth as productive<br />\nas American farmers.<br />\nThe radical alteration of the Soviet<br />\neconomy would entail three things. It<br />\nwould divert a great deal of investment<br />\naway from the expansion of conventional<br />\nmilitary capacity which is now going on<br />\nat a tremendous rate relative to the U.S.<br />\nIt would require a radical reorganization<br />\nof the Soviet governmental bureaucracy.<br />\nAnd it would entail a tacit admission that<br />\nthere was something wrong with the<br />\nsystem and by implication would detract<br />\nfrom the legitimacy of the Party in the<br />\neyes of the people and from its ability to<br />\ncontrol Soviet society.<br />\nThe first step is opposed by the<br />\nmilitary for reasons familiar to most<br />\nAmericans. The second would place the<br />\nsecure position of the Soviet bureaucracy<br />\nin jeopardy, which when attempted by<br />\nKrushchev, contributed to his ouster. The<br />\nthird would require the partial<br />\ndismantling of the coercive organs of the<br />\nSoviet state which have an interest in<br />\ntheir own preservation as is notably<br />\npointed out in Solzhenitsyn's Gulag<br />\nArchipelago. Not only do they possess<br />\nthe universal bureaucratic trait of<br />\nself-preservation, but they also represent<br />\nthe most ideologically motivated of<br />\nSoviet institutions. For them any<br />\ndecentralization of the socialist state, any<br />\nloosening of control, is, in Andropov's<br />\nwords, \"the undermining of Soviet power<br />\nfrom within.\"<br />\nUnable to pursue the radical course<br />\nbecause opposition from the three most<br />\npowerful groups in the Soviet government<br />\nwould be political suicide for him,<br />\nBrezhnev is engaged in a political<br />\ntightrope act which we call detente.<br />\nDetente, especially the trade and<br />\ninvestment opportunities, allows the<br />\nSoviet government to balance the<br />\nmaterial aspirations of the society while<br />\nalso satisfying the demands of the major<br />\ngovernmental interest groups.<br />\nImplicit in this formula is not the<br />\n\"liberalization\" of Soviet society, but<br />\nrather the strengthening of a system,<br />\neconomic and political, which is having<br />\ndifficulty standing on its own two feet. In<br />\nfact the indications are that from an<br />\norganizational standpoint, control over<br />\nthe society is being strengthened and even<br />\nmore centralized, i.e. totalized. This<br />\nmovement, termed \"neo-Stalinization,\" is<br />\nunderscored by the growing gulf between<br />\nParty members and the rest of the<br />\npopulace, by the superficial or<br />\ncentralizing nature of most<br />\nreorganization, by the increasing<br />\nsuppression of the intelligentsia and of<br />\nnon-Russian nationalities, by the<br />\nincreasing population of the Central<br />\nCommittee of the Part with military and<br />\nKGB personnel, and by the piore<br />\nfavorable regard in which Stalin is today<br />\nbeing held.<br />\nThese domestic implications of detente<br />\ncan be viewed and are viewed by<br />\ndissidents in Eastern Europe as an<br />\noutgrowth of the generally uncritical<br />\nattitude towards detente on Soviet terms<br />\nby Western leaders, media and business as<br />\nwell as political. A critical attitude<br />\ntowards detente should not be<br />\noverwhelmed by the Kissinger juggernaut<br />\nat the expense of our strategic security<br />\nand Russian civil rights. Alternatives,<br />\nbriefly stated here and largely ignored<br />\nelsewhere, would involve exacting more<br />\nfor our contribution to what is now<br />\nessentially an unbalanced trade-off or<br />\nassuming a policy of benign neglect<br />\ntowards the Soviet regime. Such a policy<br />\nmight eventually weaken it to the point<br />\nwhere it would be forced to change itself<br />\nor be overthrown.<br /><br />\nnovember 7, 1975/news-letter/page 3<br /><br />\nBuchanan and Hersh battle it out in Symposium<br /><br />\nti)<br /><br />\nPat Buchanan<br />\nBy KEN SOKOLOW<br />\n\"The chickens have come home to<br />\nroost,\" Pat Buchanan,speechwriter to the<br />\nconservative stars, maintained during a<br />\nmemorable debate with New York Times<br />\ninvestigative reporter Seymour Hersh as<br />\nthe M.S.E.

The course seemed to have filled<br />\nthat function admirably...until this week.<br />\nDuring the next few days in Northwest<br />\nAfrica, three countries\u2014Spain, Morocco,<br />\nand Algeria\u2014mays start 'shooting at one<br />\nanother over a territory named Spanish<br />\nSahara -a land with 18 times an many<br />\ncamels as cars. For all my knowledge of<br />\nsecurity imperatives, balance of power,<br />\nand mutual deterrence, I can't<br />\nimagine why any of these nations would<br />\ncovet an area whose agriculture consists<br />\nof 770 palm trees.<br />\nFirst,some historical background may<br />\nPut the current situation in perspective.<br />\nSpanish Sahara is the last of what was<br />\nonce a far-flung Spanish empire. Now<br />\nSpain, under pressure from Third World<br />\nnations in the U.N. as well as rising costs<br />\nof maintaining this colony, is prepared<br />\nto give the Sahara autonomy.<br />\nHowever,. Morocco, since gaining<br />\nindependence in the 1950's, has pressed<br />\nfor control of the area. King Hassan II has<br />\ncontended that his nation not only has a<br />\nright to Spanish colonies, but also that the<br />\ninhabitants of these states seek Moroccan<br />\nProtection.<br />\n-Looking carefully, however, it seems<br />\nunlikely that most natives of Spanish<br />\nSahara want anything more than a little<br />\ngrazing area. The 74,000 Sahaouis<br />\ntribesmen are basically a nomadic people,<br /><br />\ndependent on the small amount of<br />\npastureland for feeding their herds and<br />\nproviding a livelihood. One can hardly<br />\nbelieve that the Spanish Saharans could<br />\ncare one way or another if their political<br />\nmasters are Moroccan or Spanish.<br />\nWhy then do the respective countries<br />\ninsist that each must maintain a modicum<br />\nof control over a veritable desert? The<br />\nanswer lies in two words: phosphate and<br />\nprestige. One must note that under those<br />\nsand dunes lies an estimated two billion<br />\ntons of phosphate (NY Times, Nov. 6).<br />\nGaining access to this mine is especially<br />\ndesirable in view of the fact the price per<br />\nton of the resource jumped from $42 in<br />\n1973 to $63 in 1974.<br />\nMoreover, Hassan planned this \"civilian<br />\nmarch\" to stress the strength of his<br />\ncontinually threatened government.<br />\nFurthermore, it is staged at a time when<br />\nthe Spaniards are tied up in their own<br />\nproblems of political leadership. Yet,<br />\nJuan Carlos, Franco's apparent successor,<br />\nwould like to prove his is a true guardian<br />\nof national honor by defending this last<br />\nvestige of the Spanish empire. From the<br />\nwire service photographs, the scene in<br />\nMorocco resembles a picnic; in Spanish<br />\nSahara, an armed camp.<br />\nHow the king expects that the<br />\npilgrim age will defeat the Spanish<br />\nmili.tary I'll never know. The outcome of<br />\nthe whole affair could be a war between<br />\nMorocco and the alliance of Spain and<br />\nAlgeria. It seems everyone wants to do<br />\nwhat's best for the local residents...except<br />\nto leave them to their grazing.<br /><br />\nbefore he kills you.<br />\nAlso it is important to remember that<br />\ninherent in all put-downs is a cultural<br />\nsuperiority assumption. You must assume<br />\nthat the put-down ridicules the values of<br />\nthe put-downee. But be sure he<br />\nunderstands that you are scornful. Many<br />\na put-down have failed because the victim<br />\ntook them for compliments.<br />\nAlso be sure you do not go over his<br />\nhead. It is highly admirable to banter<br />\nabout quotes in Attic Greek, especially if<br />\nthey cut like a razor.

Yet some<br />\npeople, namely Pat Buchanan and<br />\nGordon Liddy, \"didn't learn much from<br />\nthe whole process\" of Watergate.<br />\nHersh praised the advocacy journalism<br />\ndenounced by Buchanan as \"the objective<br />\ndetermination of the press that there is a<br />\nright and wrong\u2014and we were wrong in<br />\nVietnam.\" In his view, the \"broad<br />\nmajority which makes this country run<br />\nanyway\" came to a rational decision that<br />\nthe war was wrong on the basis of the<br />\nevidence presented to them; it was not a<br />\ncase of sinister press propagnda.<br />\nSy Hersh spoke very rapidly and<br />\nconstantly interrupted his sentences in<br />\nmid-stream as a new thought struck him.<br />\nThis style of delivery and his ready wit<br />\nled one member of the audience to liken<br />\nHersh to humorist Woody Allen.<br />\nBuchanan was given five minutes for<br />\nrebuttal. He held his previous ground and<br />\nstated that Hersh's emotionalism and<br />\nvalue judgements just went to prove his<br />\nown points; \"Hersh is the type of New<br />\nJ ournalist we have in America.\" He<br />\ndefended the Nixon administration's<br />\nVietnam policy, including the bombing of<br />\nCambodia, which he considered a good<br />\nmilitary tactic. Buchanan also accused the<br />\nKhmer Rouge\u2014\"the heroes of the<br />\npress\"\u2014of committing genocide against<br />\nthe Cambodian people. The former Nixon<br />\nspeechwriter, who is now a correspondent<br />\nfor the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, said<br />\nthat he had come to Hopkins to discuss<br />\nthe present state of journalism but that<br />\nMr. Hersh -had injected the irrelevant<br />\nVietnam issue into the debate.<br />\nThe only attitudes shared by both<br />\nspeakers were a belief that columnist Jack<br />\nAnderson should not have received a<br />\nPulitzer prize for publishing leaked<br />\nclassified documents (Hersh: \"That<br />\nbothers me about our business\") and an<br />\nadmiration for the literary style and acute<br />\nperception of Dr. Hunter S.

It is<br />\nlikely that the same attempts to<br />\nstrengthen it, on the one hand, and<br />\nabolish it altogether, on the other, will be<br />\nattempted again this year.<br />\nStatistics from the Registrar's office<br />\nindicate that for the fourth year in a row<br />\nthe number of course offerings has<br />\ndeclined. Thus far, only 30 courses, not<br />\nincluding independent research and<br />\nstudies, will be offered this year. Officials<br />\nin the Registrar's office do not anticipate<br />\nthat many more will be added, although<br />\nthe possibility still exists.<br />\nThirteen of the 27 Homewood<br />\nacademic departments are not offering<br />\nany courses, although many will sponsor<br />\nindependent projects for credit.<br />\nLast year 77 courses were given, 84 the<br />\nyear before, and 85 the year before that.<br />\nDepartments offered 22 independent<br />\nstudy courses in the 1974 Intersession.<br />\nThere were 1039 course enrollments last<br />\nyear, and 1137 the year before that.<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences George<br />\nOwen said he is not at all satisfied with<br />\nthe offerings thus far and pledged to<br />\napply more pressure to departments to<br />\nincrease the number of Intersession<br />\ncourses.<br />\nDr. Sigmund Suskind, Dean of<br />\nGraduate and Undergraduate Studies,<br />\nagreed with Owen that the number of<br />\ncourses scheduled thus far will not make<br />\n4A.:4c&gt;<br />\n46\"/<br />\n1<br />\n49.446`\"4:<br />\n16Px49<br />\n'<br />\nPx49<br />\n'<br />\nWould you like to<br /><br />\nfor a productive Intersessions, and said he<br />\nhas \"gently prodded\" the departments to<br />\nincrease their offerings.<br />\nBut both Deans admitted that little<br />\npressure has been exerted on the<br />\ndepartments to beef up their offerings,<br />\nand they indicated that they will not do<br />\nthat much more now to bolster the<br />\nnumber of offerings. Owen did promise,<br />\nthough, to tali: to the chairmen of the<br />\ndepartments not offering any scheduled<br />\nIntersession courses.<br />\nThe Deans' reluctance to pressure the<br />\nfaculty into greater participation stems<br />\nfrom the long-standing opposition to the<br />\nwinter program of a certain portion of<br />\nthe faculty.<br />\nThe faculty has argued in the past that<br />\nIntersession was set up six years ago as a<br />\nstrictly voluntary program. To require or<br />\ncoerce faculty into teaching would violate<br />\nthat \"contract,\" they contend. Much of<br />\nthe faculty maintains that if they are<br />\nasked to increase their teaching load they<br />\nshould be compensated accordingly.<br />\nBoth Owen and Suskind asserted that<br />\nthese faculty claims are justified.<br />\nMoreover, they both underscored<br />\nyesterday their belief that Intersession is<br />\nnot a quality academic program and that<br />\nthey personally favor reverting back to a<br />\ntwo-semester system with extended<br />\nreading periods.<br />\nThe University presently operates<br />\nofficially under a \"4-0-4\" system,<br />\nalthough the maintenance of credit<br />\ncourses between semester implies a<br />\n\"4-14\" set-up.<br />\nSuskind commented, \"I would<br />\n\u2022\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nconsider Intersession a weak program.

One<br />\none hand, some twenty million men and<br />\nwomen spend millions a year for the sake<br />\nof a sport which they pursue with the<br />\ndedication of aficionados at Pamplona.<br />\nOn the other, hunting is reviled by a not<br />\nnegligible portion of our population as<br />\nwasteful, sadistic, and-anachronistic: the<br />\ncommercialized, debased, and organized<br />\nSlaughter of wildlife heritage.<br />\nVisions of challenging, uniting, and<br />\nc ommunicating with nature diverge<br />\nradically from imagined scenes in which<br />\nherds of blood-thirsty atavists encircle<br />\nand exterminate the remaining fifty<br />\nrabbits extant in the United States. From<br />\nthe latter perspective, one need only<br />\ntraverse the Hopkins campus and view<br />\nSquirrels peacefully hiding nuts for<br />\nwinter, and mix expressions of relief at<br />\ntheir safety only with rage directed at the<br /><br />\nwar-surplus goods.<br />\nThe documentary reiterated what is<br />\nincreasingly obvious: a neutral set of facts<br />\nconcerning the multi-faceted issue of<br />\ngame-animal killing, and the people, land,<br />\nanimals, and industry involved, is<br />\nincreasingly hard to come by. At one<br />\nextreme looms the National Rifle<br />\nAssociation, not exactly acclaimed for its<br />\nexpanded mentality and enlightened<br />\napproach to anything, and at the other<br />\nare people who despise hunting, are afraid<br />\nof guns, and regard the sport as a feeble<br />\neffort to reassert, by means of bullying<br />\nand slaughtering helpless animals, a<br />\nmythological machine badly damaged by<br />\nWomen's Liberation. They equate hunters<br />\nwith law-and-order Wallace supporters,<br />\nand are also usually uninformed about<br />\nmost aSpects of hunting and certainly<br />\ncannot understand how any decent<br />\nhuman being could achieve any<br />\ngratification through such an activity.<br />\nThus, those who are most knowledgeable<br />\nabout hunting seem to be too prejudiced<br />\nin its favor to make unbiased comments<br />\nconcerning it, and those whose<br /><br />\nindividuals who prey on American game<br />\nanimals.<br />\nOn September 5, 1975, CBS<br />\nbroadcasted a ninety-minute special<br />\nentitled \"The Guns of Autumn,\" which,<br />\nif lacking in impartiality and rational<br />\njudgement, managed to transmogrify<br />\nhunters into bloodthirsty inebriates for<br />\nwhom alone the death penalty should be<br />\nrestored. The program obviously<br />\nabandoned, if indeed it ever considered, a<br />\nbalanced objective approach to hunting in<br />\nAmerica for footage which, in its<br />\nportrayal of bears being shot out of trees<br />\nat a garbage dump and deer being shot on<br />\nhalf-a-grand-a-trophy game farms, and<br />\napparently attempted only to incite<br />\nunreasoning moral disgust. Shots of a<br />\nEuropean white fallow deer being<br />\n\"riddled\" by three rifle shells, and after<br />\nbeing dropped, by four or five bullets<br />\nfrom a German Luger, were not designed<br />\nto evoke admiration for the hunter.

G. KNOWLES<br />\nAt the beginning of a, Monday night<br />\nfootball game eleven days ago, the<br />\nBuffalo Bills were on top of the world.<br />\n1975 was to be their season. The \"Juice\"<br />\nwas running wild. Ferguson was off to his<br />\nbest start as a pro. An atmosphere of<br />\nexuberant confidence was reflected in the<br />\nBills as \"the Mouth\" interviewed them.<br />\nThen the New York Giants incredibly<br />\nbeat them. Suddenly everything wasn't<br />\ncoming up roses anymore. The Miami<br />\nDolphins proceeded to trample all over<br />\nthe Bills' flower bed as they came from<br />\nbehind to beat the Bills in a game that<br />\nwas seemingly wrapped up in the first<br />\nquarter.<br />\nLast week only a sensational 64-yard<br />\npass reception by Simpson saved them<br />\nfrom a third straight defeat as they beat<br />\nthe Jets by a point.<br /><br />\nNow, halfway through the season, a<br />\ngame behind Miami, they must face the<br />\nprospects of taking on Cincinnatti. St.<br />\nLouis, and Miami on the road, plus a<br />\nseason finale with the Vikings, at home.<br />\nWhat all this adds up to is that Buffalo<br />\ncan't afford to lose again if they hope to<br />\nhave any kind of a shot at the playoffs.<br />\nThere's no way they can rely on the wild<br />\ncard berth that got them into last year's<br />\nplayoffs. Almost assuredly that spot will<br />\nbelong to one of the three teams involved<br />\nin the AFC Central Division dogfight.<br />\nThis is an unfortunate,perspective for<br />\nthe Baltimore Colts who are travelling up<br />\nto Buffalo this week in search of their<br />\nthird straight win and a chance to even up<br />\ntheir record at 4-4. That the Bills are a<br />\nvery good football team is somewhat of<br />\nan understatement, but for the most part,<br />\ntheir fortunes rest with Mr. Superstar,<br /><br />\nthe Bills make it<br /><br />\nO.J. Simpson.<br />\nContaining O.J. is not impossible, but<br />\nin so doing, a defense becomes extremely<br />\nvulnerable to other vastly improved<br />\naspects of the Bills offensive machine\u2014an<br />\nattack that totally subdued the world<br />\nchampion Steelers.<br />\nWhen Baltimore last played the Bills<br />\nfour weeks ago, middle linebacker Mike<br />\nCurtis keyed on Simpson's every move.<br />\nFor the first thirty minutes it worked<br />\npretty well. Ferguson though, capitalized<br />\non Baltimore's fascination with the<br />\n\"Juice\" and used play action passes to<br />\nopen up his passing game.<br />\nA fake pitch to Simpson as he moved<br />\nquickly outside served two purposes. It<br />\nwould either send the linebackers (and<br />\nparticularly Curtis) moving after Simpson<br />\nputting them out of position to stop a<br />\ncharging Jim Braxton, or else it acted as a<br /><br />\nGeorgetown succumbs to Jay Rooters<br />\nBy DAVID KRAUS<br />\nWith a . convincing 1-0 victory over<br />\nDivision I rival Georgetown Wednesday<br />\nafternoon at Homewood, the Blue Jay<br />\nVarsity Soccer team moved one step<br />\nCloser to a possible NCAA post-season<br />\nplayoff bid.<br />\nThe start of the game was delayed<br />\nnearly half an hour due to the late arrival<br />\nof the Hoyas. Once the contest did get<br />\nunderway, however, it appeared as<br />\nthough the visitors had left their offense<br />\nback on the Washington Beltway.<br />\nHopkins totally controlled the first<br />\nfifteen minutes of the match as they<br />\nbombarded the Georgetown goal with<br />\nShot after shot. Meanwhile, Hopkins<br />\ngoalie Ken Seusse did not face a Hoya<br />\nShot during this same period of time.<br />\nThe Jays scored the game's only goal at<br />\nthe 16:26 mark of the apening half. Gary<br />\nIgnatowski passed the ball to Greg<br />\nCunningham, who proceeded to dribble<br />\nPast several defenders and rifle a shot past<br />\nthe helpless Hoya netminder.<br />\nThe flow of play for the remainder of<br />\nthe half was very similar to the pattern<br />\nthat had already been established.<br />\nHopkins made the game appear to be a<br />\nhalf-field sc-rimmage to set up any scoring<br />\noPportunities. At halftime, the Jays held<br />\na 20-4 margin in shots on goal and goalie<br />\nSeusse had not been forced to make a<br />\nsave.<br />\nPlay resumed in the second forty-five<br /><br />\nminutes where it had left off after the<br />\nfirst. The Jays continued their shot<br />\nbarrage\u2014although they failed to add to<br />\ntheir lead\u2014and the defense continued its<br />\nstranglehold on the Hoyas offense.<br />\nFinal statistics showed Hopkins (now<br />\n9-1-1) with a 37-11 lead in shots and<br />\nSeusse making only three saves en route<br />\nto his fifth shutout of the season.<br />\nHomewood Coach Bob Oliver was<br />\npleased with the team's performance.<br />\n\"We dominated it [the game] in every<br />\naspect,\" he declared. \"We had plenty of<br />\nchances, but could only put the ball in<br />\nthe goal once.\"<br />\nThe coach had special plaudits for his<br />\ndefensive corps.<br />\n\"Ami Cohen did an admirable job,\"<br />\nOliver noted. \"Cazzy [Bruce Cazenave]<br />\ndid a fine job as our rover back and Lou<br />\n[Podrazik] and Frank [Olszewski]<br />\nplayed very steady games.\"<br />\nThe victory, however, does not assure<br />\nthe Blue Jays of an NCAA tournament<br />\nbid. They must play tough Washington<br />\nCollege (9-2) tomorrow in an away<br />\ncontest that may decide which team will<br />\nsee post-season action.<br />\nWashington is led by Billy Williams, a<br />\ntwenty-goal scorer so far this season, and<br />\ngoalkeeper Pete Murphy. Their losses<br />\nhave been to Loyola and Swarthmore, a<br />\npair of teams that Hopkins has defeated,<br />\nwhile among their wins is a victory over<br />\nGeorge Washington, a squad that downed<br /><br />\nthe Jays in pre-season play.<br />\n\"A lot rides on Saturday's game,\"<br />\nCoach Oliver explained. \"The NCAA has<br />\nallowed regional chairmen to wait until<br />\nSunday before making their decision,<br />\nwhich will be announced on Monday.\"<br />\n\"I was informed by the Southern<br />\nchairman that there are eight teams in the<br />\nrunning for the four bids from this region<br />\nand that we're one of the eight.\"<br />\nAn interesting sidelight of tomorrow's<br />\ncontest is that it cannot end in a tie. It's<br />\nan MAC conference match, and under<br />\nleague rules the teams must continue to<br />\nplay in sudden death overtime until a<br />\nwinner is found.<br /><br />\nUMBC hosts National<br />\nBoh Metro b-ball Classic<br />\nThe National Brewing Company will<br />\nsponsor the Boh Metro Classic December<br />\n4-5-6 at - the University of Maryland<br />\nBaltimore County, it was jointly<br />\nannounced by Roger Goss, promotion<br />\nmanager for National and Lee Horowitz,<br />\ntournament director.<br />\nThe tournament, in its fifth year, was<br />\nformerly sponsered by the F &amp; M<br />\nSchaefer Brewing Company and features<br />\nseven metropolitan Baltimore colleges<br />\nand universities: Coppin State College,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University, Loyola<br /><br />\nFootball team tries a new quarterback<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nWhat, change quarterbacks in<br />\n'hid-season? When you're winning\u2014never,<br />\nbut when you're 1-4-1 you'll try<br />\nanything.<br />\nActually the move by Hopkins Head<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox, prior to last week's<br />\n40-20 loss at Moravian, was not all that<br />\nradical, especially when the newcomer<br />\nhas the credentials of new Blue Jay field<br />\ngeneral, Tom Bender.<br />\nIncumbent signal-caller Dave Emala<br />\nwas moved to wing-back in order to take<br />\nadvantage of his fine speed and excellent<br />\nhands which make him an ideal wide<br />\nreceiver and the perfect complement to<br />\nSplit end Joey Devlin, the Jays' other fine<br />\nWide receiver. With aerial threats now<br />\ncoming at them from both sides,<br />\nHomewood opponents can no longer<br />\nconcentrate their coverage on Devlin<br />\nalone.<br />\nThat left the quarterback throne<br />\nvacant and Cox went with Bender at the<br />\nhelm. The freshman from Loyola had<br /><br />\nimpeccable qualifications, having been<br />\nselected First Team All-State QB in his<br />\nsenior year. As a sophomore, Bender took<br />\nover for the injured Dan Dullea(now star<br />\nsignal-caller at Towson State) with no<br />\napparent drop-off in talent.<br />\n\"I wanted to go to school for an<br />\neducation first, but also play football,\"<br />\ncommented the social and behavioral<br />\nsciences major,\"and I could do both here<br />\nat Hopkins.\"<br />\n\"Granted the football here is Division<br />\nIII, low pressure, but I was really<br />\nsurprised by the high quality of the<br />\nprogram and the team.\"<br />\n\"The attitude around here is really<br />\ngreat,also,\" Bender continued, \"because<br />\neveryone is playing football because they<br />\nwant to, because they like to; not because<br />\nthey have to!\"<br />\n\"Like Saturday, I was a little nervous<br />\nbut because the team had gone up the<br />\nday before, we all got a little closer, got<br />\nto know each other better and that gave<br />\nme more confidence so that when game<br /><br />\n\"freeze\" to give the receivers a vital<br />\nsecond to get open in the Colt secondary.<br />\nSince then Curtis has been injured, and<br />\nhis replacement, Jim Cheyunski, has been<br />\nimpressive. Cheyunslci came over from<br />\nthe Bills earlier in the season, so he<br />\nshouldn't have much trouble getting up.<br />\nfor his old teammates. Stan White, the<br />\noutside linebacker, has also looked good,<br />\nand he'll be calling the defensive signals<br />\non Sunday.<br />\nAnother addition since the Buffalo<br />\ngame is cornerback Lloyd Mumphord,who<br />\ncomes from the. Dolphins. The Colt<br />\ndefense is far from being considers one of<br />\nsolid NFL calibre, nevertheless it does<br />\nshow tremendous potential.<br />\nThey'll have to work out a finely tuned<br />\nbalance against the Bills. They have to<br />\nmake O.J. \"earn his 100 yards\" as Coach<br />\nMarchibroda said. But a balance must be<br />\nmaintained between keying on Simpson<br />\ntoo much, and not keying on him<br />\nenough. Too much weight on either side<br />\nwill destroy the equilibrium and could<br />\nmake it easy for the Bills to get out of<br />\nhand.<br />\nThe Colts are very capable of getting a<br />\nlot of points on the scoreboard, although<br />\nthe bump-and-run tactics Buffalo<br />\nsometimes employs could give<br />\nquarterback Bert Jones some trouble. If<br />\nthat happens, Jones can go to his tight<br />\nend Raymond Chester, as he did against<br />\nthe Browns last week.<br />\nThere should be a lot of scoring in this<br />\ngame, the Colts are not yet up to the task<br />\nof containing the Bills, but their chances<br />\nof winning depend on the success of the<br />\ndefense, and to what extent the Colt<br />\ndefense can keep Baltimore in the game.<br /><br />\ntime rolled around, I wasn't really<br />\nworried.\"<br />\nEven though his initial effort as a<br />\ncollegiate quarterback did not result in a<br />\nvictory, Bender was nonetheless<br />\nimpressive, especially through the air. He<br />\nfired two scoring strikes, one a 38-yard<br />\nbomb to Emala, and the other a nine-yard<br />\ntoss to halfback Brett Miles in which,<br />\nwith his primary receivers covered,<br />\nBender exhibited poise in remaining in<br />\nthe pocket and hitting his safety valve<br />\ncoming out of the backfield for a score.<br />\nDespite the Blue Jays' disappointing<br />\nrecord thus far, Bender's optimism was<br />\napparent.<br />\nOffense Underrated<br />\n\"I think our offense is really<br />\nunderrated.
