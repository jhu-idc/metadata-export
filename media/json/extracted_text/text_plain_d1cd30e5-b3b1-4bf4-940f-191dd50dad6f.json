Edelman, Carl Hartman,<br />\n<br />\nFriday, December 8, 1933<br />\n<br />\nLet's See Some Action<br />\nOmicron Delta Kappa has at last initiated, and<br />\nthe worst and best is known by everyone. Disappointments and gratifications, the conventional reactions, are running their course, but the chief point<br />\nof interest to the campus is that now we expect to see<br />\na little utility attaching itself to one of the most<br />\nprominent campus institutions.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the method of elections to<br />\nthe group leaves such a few men to begin operations<br />\neach year. After graduation last June only four students were left to compose the active membership for<br />\nthe current year. Recognizing this fact, we have<br />\nforeborne to say anything about the apparent inactivity of 0. D. K. during the first two months of this<br />\nterm. But that excuse will not obtain for very much<br />\nlonger; we hope to see some constructive programs<br />\nforthcoming from the \"campus leaders\".<br />\nThe fraternity was originally meant to be a form<br />\nof recognition for conspicuous work in extra-curricular activities, but tradition has added to its functions<br />\nthat of influencing reforms where they are necessary<br />\nand of lending powerful support to expedient measures. The opportunity which 0. D. K. has to act in<br />\nthis capacity is practically unlimited. It has free<br />\naccess to the services of the most influential men on<br />\nthe campus and can command the attention of faculty and student body to its projects.<br />\nIt may be assumed that there is now a sufficiently<br />\nrepresentative membership to permit whatever form<br />\nof activity may be required. We hope that no delinquency will develop which will force us to repeat the<br />\ncriticism we made last April, namely, that the boys<br />\nwere asleep.<br />\n<br />\nA Matter Of Finesse<br />\nThe sporadic and ludicrous attempts of the more<br />\nliberally-minded gentlemen in our midst to convert us<br />\nto communistic outlooks are becoming more and more<br />\nineffective with each newly-concocted piece of prop-<br />\n<br />\naganda. We don't object to being liberalized. We<br />\neven confess to being quite conservative in social and<br />\neconomic matters and to needing a little bit of counterbalancing radicalism.<br />\nIn evidence of the goodwill which we bear in a<br />\ngeneric way to the pink gentlemen aforementioned,<br />\nwe dont mind offering a few criticisms of their present methods, which 'are beginning to pall considerably and to offer next to no stimulation whatsoever.<br />\nTake, for instance, this tabloid, Toxin Anti-toxin,<br />\nwhich so shocked our sense of literary decency when<br />\nit was circulated last week. It was anything but neat;<br />\nthe best articles could not rise above the level of soapbox prating; and the attacks made upon various fronts<br />\nwere anything but clever. Any thought which might<br />\nhave motivated the paper was entirely obscured by the<br />\nwretched psychology employed in presenting it. It<br />\nwas childish.<br />\nWe return from Thanksgiving recess and find<br />\nthat the forces of \"justice for the oppressed\" have<br />\nnot been sleeping. Nay, rather, they have been losing<br />\na good deal of rest in clandestinely climbing up the<br />\nflag-pole to grease it carefully, for the purpose of preventing anyone from taking down the nondescript<br />\nrag proclaiming sorrily from the top, \"Free the<br />\nScottsboro boys; Death to lynchers.\" There's drama<br />\nfor you!<br />\nCome now, gentlemen; isn't that rather gross?<br />\nThere are many notable men whose sentiments are<br />\njust as strong as yours who yet would be revolted by<br />\nyour methods of propaganda. We can be approached<br />\non an intelligent basis and your ideas may be set<br />\nforth clearly and forcefully without your having to<br />\nindulge in all this clap-trap. It's degrading, if nothing else, to the intellectual foundations of your cause.<br />\nPermit yourselves to be human long enough to realize<br />\nthat to secure a person's support for your projects<br />\nyou must first gain his confidence.<br />\nIf you think you have cause whereof to fight<br />\nwith us, show some decent weapons and come out and<br />\nstand your ground. But for pity's sake don't start<br />\nthrowng pillows.<br />\n<br />\nKilling The Goose<br />\nAfter the exhibition made by the team on Thanksgiving Day against a much heavier St. John's team<br />\nwe are moved to remind the athletic department again<br />\nthat unless the schedule is prepared more carefully<br />\nnext year Hopkins will be the laughing-stock of the<br />\nlocal football circle. Time and again we have been<br />\npitted against teams greatly superior to us and have<br />\nreceived the just rewards of our presumption. As a<br />\ngeneral rule we are better-matched with St. John's,<br />\nit is true, but as a general principle, our schedule is<br />\nnot a suitable one.<br />\nThe idea at the beginning was that by scheduling<br />\nsome bigger teams we might make enough money to<br />\nkeep out of the red. This year this income began<br />\nto slip away. Very few rooters from U. of M. took<br />\nthe trouble to watch the Terps whitewash the Jays,<br />\nand that's hard on the gate. The fans are quite conscious that the Blue Jays are pretty generally playing out of their class.<br />\nTo intelligent men only one of two courses is<br />\nopen: either pay athletes to play for us, as our opponents do; or else retrench our schedule to a more<br />\nmodest level.

Edelman, Carl Hartman,<br /><br />\nFriday, December 8, 1933<br /><br />\nLet's See Some Action<br />\nOmicron Delta Kappa has at last initiated, and<br />\nthe worst and best is known by everyone. Disappointments and gratifications, the conventional reactions, are running their course, but the chief point<br />\nof interest to the campus is that now we expect to see<br />\na little utility attaching itself to one of the most<br />\nprominent campus institutions.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the method of elections to<br />\nthe group leaves such a few men to begin operations<br />\neach year. After graduation last June only four students were left to compose the active membership for<br />\nthe current year. Recognizing this fact, we have<br />\nforeborne to say anything about the apparent inactivity of 0. D. K. during the first two months of this<br />\nterm. But that excuse will not obtain for very much<br />\nlonger; we hope to see some constructive programs<br />\nforthcoming from the \"campus leaders\".<br />\nThe fraternity was originally meant to be a form<br />\nof recognition for conspicuous work in extra-curricular activities, but tradition has added to its functions<br />\nthat of influencing reforms where they are necessary<br />\nand of lending powerful support to expedient measures. The opportunity which 0. D. K. has to act in<br />\nthis capacity is practically unlimited. It has free<br />\naccess to the services of the most influential men on<br />\nthe campus and can command the attention of faculty and student body to its projects.<br />\nIt may be assumed that there is now a sufficiently<br />\nrepresentative membership to permit whatever form<br />\nof activity may be required. We hope that no delinquency will develop which will force us to repeat the<br />\ncriticism we made last April, namely, that the boys<br />\nwere asleep.<br /><br />\nA Matter Of Finesse<br />\nThe sporadic and ludicrous attempts of the more<br />\nliberally-minded gentlemen in our midst to convert us<br />\nto communistic outlooks are becoming more and more<br />\nineffective with each newly-concocted piece of prop-<br /><br />\naganda. We don't object to being liberalized. We<br />\neven confess to being quite conservative in social and<br />\neconomic matters and to needing a little bit of counterbalancing radicalism.<br />\nIn evidence of the goodwill which we bear in a<br />\ngeneric way to the pink gentlemen aforementioned,<br />\nwe dont mind offering a few criticisms of their present methods, which 'are beginning to pall considerably and to offer next to no stimulation whatsoever.<br />\nTake, for instance, this tabloid, Toxin Anti-toxin,<br />\nwhich so shocked our sense of literary decency when<br />\nit was circulated last week. It was anything but neat;<br />\nthe best articles could not rise above the level of soapbox prating; and the attacks made upon various fronts<br />\nwere anything but clever. Any thought which might<br />\nhave motivated the paper was entirely obscured by the<br />\nwretched psychology employed in presenting it. It<br />\nwas childish.<br />\nWe return from Thanksgiving recess and find<br />\nthat the forces of \"justice for the oppressed\" have<br />\nnot been sleeping. Nay, rather, they have been losing<br />\na good deal of rest in clandestinely climbing up the<br />\nflag-pole to grease it carefully, for the purpose of preventing anyone from taking down the nondescript<br />\nrag proclaiming sorrily from the top, \"Free the<br />\nScottsboro boys; Death to lynchers.\" There's drama<br />\nfor you!<br />\nCome now, gentlemen; isn't that rather gross?<br />\nThere are many notable men whose sentiments are<br />\njust as strong as yours who yet would be revolted by<br />\nyour methods of propaganda. We can be approached<br />\non an intelligent basis and your ideas may be set<br />\nforth clearly and forcefully without your having to<br />\nindulge in all this clap-trap. It's degrading, if nothing else, to the intellectual foundations of your cause.<br />\nPermit yourselves to be human long enough to realize<br />\nthat to secure a person's support for your projects<br />\nyou must first gain his confidence.<br />\nIf you think you have cause whereof to fight<br />\nwith us, show some decent weapons and come out and<br />\nstand your ground. But for pity's sake don't start<br />\nthrowng pillows.<br /><br />\nKilling The Goose<br />\nAfter the exhibition made by the team on Thanksgiving Day against a much heavier St. John's team<br />\nwe are moved to remind the athletic department again<br />\nthat unless the schedule is prepared more carefully<br />\nnext year Hopkins will be the laughing-stock of the<br />\nlocal football circle. Time and again we have been<br />\npitted against teams greatly superior to us and have<br />\nreceived the just rewards of our presumption. As a<br />\ngeneral rule we are better-matched with St. John's,<br />\nit is true, but as a general principle, our schedule is<br />\nnot a suitable one.<br />\nThe idea at the beginning was that by scheduling<br />\nsome bigger teams we might make enough money to<br />\nkeep out of the red. This year this income began<br />\nto slip away. Very few rooters from U. of M. took<br />\nthe trouble to watch the Terps whitewash the Jays,<br />\nand that's hard on the gate. The fans are quite conscious that the Blue Jays are pretty generally playing out of their class.<br />\nTo intelligent men only one of two courses is<br />\nopen: either pay athletes to play for us, as our opponents do; or else retrench our schedule to a more<br />\nmodest level. The first alternative insults our academic<br />\npride, so the second is the only way out of the dilemna. We have been putting bigger and bigger games<br />\non our schedule until our chances of drawing great<br />\ncrowds are almost pil. If we don't scale down immediately we'll be in danger of killing the already<br />\nstrangling goose that was expected to lay golden eggs.<br /><br />\nSURVEY HERE REVEALS<br />\nIDEAL WOMAN TO BE<br />\nMOVIE STAR COMPOSITE<br />\n(Continued from Page 1, Col. 5)<br />\nFifth Symphony on the harmonica.\". \"I like her sweet sixteen and<br />\nnever been\u2014missed.\" \"She must<br />\nbe white.\" \"She should be white.\"<br />\n\"I'd prefer her to be white.\"<br />\nMany students boasted they<br />\nsmoked nothing but cigars.
