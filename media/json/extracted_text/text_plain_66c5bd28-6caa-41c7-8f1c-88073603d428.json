He<br />\nexplained that ethnic symbols<br />\ndevelop when sharp distinctions<br />\nbetween cultures exist. The<br />\nheaddress arose as a symbol of<br />\nethnic identity at a time when<br />\npanindian ethnic sentiment<br />\nbegan to overcome loyalty to individual tribes and features of<br />\ndress were becomming important to other American ethnic<br />\ngroups.<br />\nAccording to Sturtevant, the<br />\ndevelopment of the modern<br />\nplains headdress or \"war bonnet,\" now used as a symbol<br />\nboth by and for American Indians, involved at least one major process of cultural feedback. When Brazil was<br />\ndiscovered by Europeans in the<br />\nearly sixteenth century, the<br />\nTupinamba tribe of Indians lived<br />\n<br />\nthere. These natives wore a<br />\n\"feather crown\" consisting of<br />\na headdress sypporting a<br />\ncylinder of feathers which<br />\nflared at the top.<br />\nSturtevant showed many<br />\nslides both of these actual<br />\nAmerican artifacts and of<br />\nEuropean representations of<br />\nthem.<br />\nOriginally, a major purpose<br />\nof the bonnet was to challenge<br />\nenemy warriors to attempt to<br />\ntake it by killing the wearer.<br />\nIn Europe, over the next 200<br />\nto 250 years, the feather crown,<br />\nskirt, and other ornaments<br />\nbecame symbolic of the<br />\nAmerican native dress, and<br />\neven though various tribes later<br />\ncontacted in the Americas often<br />\ndressed very differently, many<br />\npaintings and woodcuts show<br />\nthem wearing Tupinamba ornaments. Sturtevant explained<br />\nthat at that time in Europe, the<br />\nstatus of individuals was very<br />\nmuch reflected by their mode of<br />\ndress; the words \"costume\"<br />\nand \"custom,\" have a common<br />\nroot in both English and<br />\nFrench.<br />\nThe feather crown was introduced to the Indians of<br />\nEastern North America by<br />\nEuropeans in the seventeenth<br />\nand eighteenth centuries, and<br />\nthese Indians used it as a<br />\n<br />\ncultural boundary marker.<br />\nThe swept-back war bonnet<br />\nof today is thought to have<br />\noriginated in the Western plains<br />\nof the continent. Although<br />\nseveral painters who traveled<br />\namong the plains Indians portrayed few of these headdresses,<br />\none Indian drew himself in one,<br />\nsuggesting that the bonnet was<br />\nserving as an ethnic symbol accepted by Indians and others<br />\nalike, whether authentically Indian or not.<br />\nTwentieth century eastern Indians began to wear the war<br />\nbonnet and use it as a \"symbol<br />\nof Indianness,\" according to<br />\nSturtevant and shown in several<br />\nof his slides.

It's now been 22.<br />\nAt the time, students didn't have any<br />\nparticular reason to doubt what University President Steven Muller said in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission: WJHU would return to the air<br />\nJuly 1 or soon thereafter. That was the<br />\nlast time anyone has been inclined to<br />\nbelieve much of anything the administration has said about the station.<br />\nThe summer came and went, but when<br />\nstudents returned in the fall, some two<br />\nmonths after the station was to have<br />\nreturned to the air, nothing had happened. Mid-terms arrived, but the station<br />\nstill wasn't back. Everybody went home<br />\nfor Thanksgiving\u2014still with no WJHU.<br />\nFinally, in December, about six months<br />\nafter we had been told the station would<br />\nbe back, the University announced that<br />\nit would indeed return\u2014the following<br />\nfall. Now let's remember: this would be<br />\nmore than a year after the administration had first said the station would come<br />\nback on the air.<br />\nIn any event, B.J. Norris, vice president for communications and public affairs, who had been placed in charge of<br />\nthe station, began planning for its return.<br />\n\"Our first priority,\" she said at the time,<br />\n\"is to extend our FCC permit,\" which<br />\nwas due to expire in February, 1985. To<br />\nget an extension required some show of<br />\ninterest in maintaining a station, and sure<br />\nenough the administration suddenly<br />\ndiscovered it could fund a return of the<br />\n10-watt station until the power increase.<br />\nSo that winter the student-run WJHU<br />\nwent back on the air, while the party-line<br />\nwas still that the larger station would<br />\nstart in the fall.<br />\nEnter Dave Creagh. Hired during the<br />\nsummer as WJHU's new General<br />\nManager, he came with a guarantee that<br />\nthe station would start up in the... no,<br />\nnot fall\u2014spring. That required another<br />\nextension from the FCC, which was by<br />\nnow said to be less than pleased with<br />\nHopkins. But it granted the extension<br />\nanyway, adding that this was the last one<br />\nthe University would ever get. No pro-<br />\n<br />\nblem, said the administration, the<br />\n25,000-watt WJHU will go on the air by<br />\nthe time the extension expires March 17.<br />\nWell... uh... maybe.<br />\nNow comes word the new station will<br />\nmiss the March deadline. Instead, the<br />\nnewest prediction is that the station will<br />\nget its power increase\u2014now lowered to<br />\n10,000 watts\u2014in June. Well, we'll<br />\nbelieve it when we see it.<br />\nWho is responsible for this mess?<br />\nWell, to be frank, we don't know. If the<br />\npower increase does come through in<br />\nJune\u2014a big if\u2014Creagh will have been<br />\non the job for less than a year; he claims<br />\nit normally takes 18-24 months to put<br />\ntogether such a station. The simple fact<br />\nis we don't know enough about organizing a major radio station to assign the<br />\nblame. But we do know enough about<br />\nmanaging a project\u2014any project\u2014to<br />\nknow that there is blame to be assigned.<br />\nThe process has simply taken too long.<br />\nWe tend to believe Creagh's claim that<br />\nmost of this is not his fault. He is obviously a driven man, one unaccustomed to failure. Instead, we believe the<br />\nlion's share of the blame must go to Norris, who dawdled too long in the early<br />\nplanning stages, and, ultimately, to<br />\nUniversity President Steven Muller. As<br />\nwith the entire university, WJHU is<br />\nMuller's responsibility, and he must accept the blame.<br />\nBut worst of all, it's clear in retrospect<br />\nthat the administration simply lied<br />\nthrough its teeth. It's obvious that the<br />\npeople who run Hopkins haven't<br />\ndistinguished themselves in the WJHU<br />\naffair, but surely the University's top officers are not so stupid that they sincerely<br />\nestimated a two-year job could be completed in three months.<br />\nThe administration's reputation is<br />\nhardly one of striking efficiency, but<br />\nWJHU has become the piece de<br />\nresistance of bumbling. The whole thing<br />\nhas become almost a parody\u2014a bit of<br />\neomic relief from the more serious worries of tuition increases and South<br />\nAfrican investments. Perhaps Creagh<br />\ncan eventually pull the thing together and<br />\ncreate a successful station; we hope so.<br />\nBut in the meantime, don't hold your<br />\nbreath for June.<br />\n<br />\nA Fair Date<br />\nFollowing the deliberations on the date<br />\nof Spring Fair recently has been about<br />\nlike watching a tennis match. First the<br />\nFair was set for April 11-13, then it was<br />\nmoved to May 2-4, and now it is back<br />\non the original April date.<br />\nThe most interesting thing about the<br />\nwhole affair, however, is not the date<br />\nchange, which now seems unavoidable,<br />\nbut is Associate Dean of Students Chris<br />\nColombo's remarks that the Student<br />\nCouncil does not set the date of the Fair.<br />\nThe Fair is at least putatively a studentrun event, and almost everyone has tradi-<br />\n<br />\ntionally interpreted that to mean that the<br />\nCouncil sets the date. In fact, the administration has long maintained defacto control over the important aspects of<br />\nthe Fair, such as the music and beer<br />\npolicies, but never before has it been<br />\npublicly admitted\u2014at least to our<br />\nknowledge\u2014that the administration runs<br />\nthe Fair.<br />\nSo while the date of the Fair will no<br />\ndoubt be the issue receiving all the attention in the next few days, a more serious<br />\none\u2014who controls the event\u2014will probably slip away.<br />\n<br />\nAsked to explain why<br />\nmembers of the newly-formed<br />\nHopkins Coalition for a Free<br />\nSouth Africa participated in a<br />\ndemonstration against the<br />\nuniversity on Jan.10 (the day<br />\nBishop Desmond Tutu spoke at<br />\n<br />\npatrick<br />\nbond<br />\nTurner Auditorium), many<br />\nthoughts come to mind.<br />\nOf course, what must be<br />\nstressed initially is that our protest against the university's approximately $60 million in<br />\nSouth Africa-related investments also honored Bishop<br />\nTutu as well as the memory of<br />\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. No<br />\ndisrespect for King, Tutu, or<br />\nDr. Levi Watkins (who arranged the event) was intended;<br />\nnone was transmitted.<br />\nTo backtrack a bit, at the<br />\nfirst meeting of the Coalition<br />\nfor a Free South Africa, we<br />\nwere asked to join the alreadyscheduled demonstration of the<br />\nBaltimore Anti-Apartheid<br />\ncoalition.<br />\nSo we gathered at Turner<br />\nAuditorium in East Baltimore,<br />\nfifty of us from the university<br />\nand from the city of Baltimore,<br />\nprotesting the fact that while<br />\ncontinuing to realize huge profits from apartheid, Hopkins<br />\ncould bask in the sunlight<br />\nbrought by Bishop Tutu.<br />\nWe were protesting what we<br />\nfelt was a feeble attempt by<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller to avoid embarrassment<br />\nthe day before\u2014he announced<br />\nthat Hopkins would no longer<br />\ninvest in companies which<br />\nhaven't signed the Sullivan<br />\n<br />\nBishop<br />\nDESMOND M. TUTU<br />\n<br />\nPrinciples. At most, this action<br />\naffects holdings in six minor<br />\ncompanies which merely<br />\nwanted to avoid Sullivan red<br />\ntape and signing fees. As moral<br />\nstatements against apartheid<br />\ngo, this one is, as Black Student<br />\nUnion leaders in our Coaltion<br />\nquipped, a \"whitewash.\"<br />\nUltimately, we were protesting the ethnocentric and incorrect idea that U.S. companies can play a progressive<br />\nrole in South Africa.

They claim that<br />\n<br />\nraised for experimentation, do<br />\nnot have the worth of a human<br />\nbeing. Human beings, unlike<br />\nanimals, have social positions<br />\nand obligations. Because of<br />\nthese relationships, which are<br />\nbuilt upon uniquely human<br />\nqualities, a human has far more<br />\nworth than a single animal.<br />\nThe charges that much<br />\nanimal experimentation is<br />\neither unnecessarily repetitive is<br />\nequally unfounded.

These<br />\nself-proclaimed liberators<br />\nhowever, ignore much of the<br />\nadvancements in medicine<br />\ndirectly due to animal experimentation. The list of advancements is long, from the<br />\ndiscovery of the regulatory role<br />\nof insulin in diabetics to the<br />\ndevelopment of new treatments<br />\nfor burn victims.<br />\nYet, the activists argue that<br />\nany advancements in medicine<br />\nonly delay the inevitable, and<br />\nthat furthermore, an animal's<br />\nlife is not necessarily less<br />\nvaluable than one of a human<br />\nbeing. Other animal rights activits claim that much of the experimentation done on animals<br />\nis either unnecessary due to<br />\nrepetition, or unnecessarily<br />\ncruel. Still others maintain that<br />\nanimal experimentation is some<br />\ngrand hoax of a sort, and that<br />\ninformation obtained from<br />\nanimal studies cannot have any<br />\nrelevance to human systems.<br />\nThe first point is, in my opinion, unreasonable. Animals,<br />\nparticularly those which are<br />\ndomesticated, or specifically<br />\n<br />\nof experiments is absolutely<br />\nnecessary to make sure that<br />\nreported findings are accurate,<br />\nand that proposed conlusions<br />\nare supported. In addition,<br />\nstrict guidelines are in place to<br />\nmake sure that animals are<br />\ntreated humanely.<br />\nFinally, the view that animal<br />\nexperimentation is inapplicable<br />\nto human systems is laughable.<br />\nHumans and all animals are<br />\nlinked from an evolutionary<br />\npoint of view, and as such share<br />\ncertain common features<br />\ndependent upon species. Thus<br />\nanimal systems serve as convenient analogous model systems<br />\nwhen experimentation on<br />\nhumans is inappropriate for<br />\ngathering research data epecially on a basic level.<br />\nHowever, I do agree with the<br />\npoint that animals should be<br />\ntreated as humanely as possible.<br />\nIn fact it is in the best interest<br />\nof any experiment that animals<br />\nare treated carefully as possible<br />\nso as to ensure proper results.<br />\nThis century seems to be riddled with groups whose novel<br />\ncauses are nothing more than<br />\nreconstitutions of archaic<br />\nsuperstitions and beliefs.<br />\nAnimal rights in particular<br />\nshould not be allowed to interfere with scientific work<br />\nwhich can yield important advances<br />\nin<br />\nlife-saving<br />\ntechnology.<br />\n<br />\nSouth Africa and a 'Whitewash'<br />\nContinued from Page 12<br />\n<br />\nvehicles; Caterpillar tractors are<br />\nused to destroy ancestral homes<br />\nduring forced removals; the list<br />\ngoes on.<br />\nAlthough the above companies provide goods and services which are essential in<br />\nmaintaining apartheid institutions, each of them has signed<br />\nthe Sullivan Principles and are<br />\nthus deemed by Hopkins<br />\nmorally acceptable to hold<br />\nstock in.<br />\nU.S. companies doing<br />\nbusiness in South Africa<br />\ntypically have earned about a<br />\n15 percent higher rate of return<br />\nform their operations in South<br />\nAfrica, where they have a captive Third World labor supply<br />\nand a First World consumers'<br />\nmarket, than from those in the<br />\nU.S. As a result, plant closings<br />\nin the northeastern and<br />\nmidwestern U.S. often have<br />\ndirectly corresponded with<br />\nplant openings in Port<br />\nElizabeth, Durban, and<br />\nelsewhere in South Africa. And<br />\nin return for taking advantage<br />\nof the inequal labor and consumer markets of apartheid,<br />\nthese companies, of which<br />\nHopkins owns stock in 45 out<br />\nof about 320, have made only<br />\nfleeting (and self-serving) at-<br />\n<br />\ntempts to reform the system.<br />\nHopkins has about $60<br />\nmillion invested in this evil<br />\nsystem. And that is why we<br />\ntook the opportunity of Bishop<br />\nTutu's visit to protest the<br />\nUniversity's moral hypocrisy.<br />\n(Many of us noted the<br />\nhypocrisy of Hopkin's official<br />\nnewspaper, the Gazette, which<br />\ndid its Jan. 14 cover story on<br />\nthe Tutu visit and printed the<br />\nUniversity's Sullivan Principles<br />\npolicy, without one mention of<br />\nour protest or Hopkins' $60<br />\nmillion stake in apartheid.)<br />\nIf we are serious about our<br />\nmotto\u2014\"The Truth Will<br />\nLiberate You!\"\u2014the Hopkins<br />\nstudents, faculty and staff, and<br />\nBaltimoreans actively opposed<br />\nto apartheid should demand the<br />\nUniversity acknowledge its<br />\nmoral inconsistency.

When I did,<br />\nI was somewhat disappointed.<br />\nThe book contains many of the<br />\npopular segments of the show,<br />\nin pictorial form. A lot of it is<br />\nfunny, although most is much<br />\nfunnier on T.V.<br />\nThe book begins with an<br />\neditor's foreward by Merrill<br />\nMarkoe, head writer for Late<br />\nNight. Her piece on \"What the<br />\nDogs Have Taught Me\" is<br />\ngreat. The next section, \"Opening Remarks,\" is a collection of<br />\nLetterman's best one-liners<br />\nfrom the beginning of the<br />\nshow. I found many of them<br />\nvery funny, but that may be<br />\nbecause I pictured Letterman<br />\nsaying each as I read them.<br />\nThat wonderful sarcasm in Letterman's voice and his priceless<br />\nfacial expressions have a way of<br />\nmaking an unfunny joke funny.<br />\nI honestly don't know whether<br />\nI would have found these jokes<br />\nnearly as amusing had I not<br />\nbeen familiar with Letterman's<br />\nstyle.<br />\nSeveral of the other segments<br />\nfare better, since they have pic-<br />\n<br />\ntures to accompany the jokes.<br />\nThese include \"The Museum of<br />\nthe Hard to Believe,\" \"New<br />\nGift Ideas,\" \"Dave's Toy<br />\nShop,\" and \"New Medical<br />\nAids.\" Some of the more<br />\namusing visuals included the<br />\nLaLanne Q-Tip<br />\n\"Jack<br />\nDispenser,\" the \"Wiffle Ax,\"<br />\nand \"Lifelike Duplicates of Internal Organs.\" Many were<br />\nmade funnier with pictures of<br />\nLetterman demonstrating the<br />\nitems, although again, it's not<br />\nthe same as seeing it on T.V.<br />\nLetterman's<br />\nof<br />\nTwo<br />\n\"movies\" are included here.<br />\n\"They Took my Show Away<br />\n(an Afterschool Special),\" and<br />\n\"Dog Poetry\" work almost as<br />\nwell as they do on T.V., since<br />\nthe pictures and captions cover<br />\nthe humor pretty well. Still,<br />\nthey are lacking Letterman's<br />\nvoice in the narration, a factor<br />\nthat increases the humor level<br />\nconsiderably.<br />\nSeveral multiple-choice<br />\nsprinkled<br />\nare<br />\nquizzes<br />\ncovering<br />\nbook,<br />\nthe<br />\nt<br />\nthroughou<br />\nsubjects such as T.V., summer,<br />\nand going back to school. I<br />\nfound these very funny. Unlike<br />\nthe other segments, these actually seemed funnier in print.<br />\nAlso sprinkled in among the<br />\nother segments are pictorials on<br />\n\"etiquette\" in hotels, subways,<br />\nelevators, T.V. audiences, and<br />\nbeing a talk-show guest. The<br />\n<br />\npictures of Letterman, Paul<br />\nShaffer, and Larry \"Bud\"<br />\nMelman are hysterical.<br />\nHowever, the sections on talkshow and audience etiquette<br />\nprobably would be incomprehensible to someone not<br />\nfamiliar with Late Night.<br />\nI found the section entitled<br />\n\"Camping with Barry White\"<br />\nunfunny. Of course, since I'm<br />\nnot familiar with Mr. Barry<br />\nWhite, I probably wouldn't<br />\nhave thought it was funny on<br />\nthe show, either. Not<br />\neverything on the show is funny, but, again, they should have<br />\nincluded only the best segments<br />\nof Late Night in this book.<br />\nAn entire chunk of the book<br />\nis devoted to sections written by<br />\neach of the 15 writers. Ironically, I found this section the least<br />\nfunny of the entire book. Many<br />\nwere too long, and seemed to<br />\ncontain inside jokes. The book<br />\nwould not have suffered had<br />\nthey left out this section \"The Muppets All Die and Go for one don't know any such<br />\nto Hell,\" and \"A Child's First person, so I tried to be as obentirely.<br />\nBook of Smoking\" are par- jective as possible.

Puig is an experimental realist from Argentina whose latest work, Kiss of<br />\nthe Spider Woman, continues<br />\nthe tradition he set with his<br />\nearlier novel, The Buenos Aires<br />\nAffair. Both are banned in<br />\nArgentina because of their<br />\npolitical perspectives and Puig<br />\nhas wisely chosen to make his<br />\nhome in New York. Smart<br />\nman.<br />\nPuig's approach is different<br />\nto say the least, but once one<br />\nhas grown accustomed to his<br />\nunusual story-telling style, he<br />\noccupies the reader's senses and<br />\nis fully absorbing. He likes to<br />\nuse the debris of the<br />\nand<br />\nworld\u2014newspaper<br />\nmagazine clippings, police and<br />\nhospital reports, shopping<br />\nlists\u2014and lets them all tell their<br />\nown stories without his comments or intrusions.<br />\nKiss of the Spider Woman, is<br />\nactually a running dialogue between two men in a prison cell.<br />\nThe occupants are Molina and<br />\n<br />\n'Valentin. Molina is a middleaged apolitical homosexual<br />\nwho is in for eight years for<br />\n\"corruption of minors.\" His<br />\nunlikely cell mate is Valentin, a<br />\nyoung man who is not particularly sensitive and is highly<br />\ninvolved in the political<br />\nresistance movement. He is<br />\nheld for leading revolutionary<br />\nactivities and has been tortured<br />\nand is further abused as the<br />\nwork progresses.<br />\nThe two men are incredibly<br />\ndifferent and under other circumstances would not even<br />\nacknowledge one another's existence. Within the confines of<br />\na prison cell, with considerable<br />\ntime to pass, and with the everpresent threat of torture, these<br />\ntwo men who have nothing in<br />\ncommon and nothing to talk<br />\nabout, pass the time in a<br />\ncurious way. Molina is a storyteller and he passes the time by<br />\ndescribing movies he has seen.<br />\nThe movies he retells are real<br />\nfilms and they all touch the<br />\nnovel's themes of repression<br />\nand liberation, beauty and<br />\ngoodness, love, and fear. The<br />\nfascinating twist is that all too<br />\noften what occurs in the movies<br />\nMolina shares foreshadows a<br />\nsimilar and parallel development in what is happening to<br />\nMolina and Valentin (or will).<br />\nThe movies are entertaining<br />\n<br />\nPuig's approach<br />\nis different to say<br />\nthe least. . .<br />\nin themselves and the dialogue<br />\nin which they are told is so<br />\nnatural that the reader occasionally forgets that the story is<br />\nabout these two men and the<br />\nrelationship which develops<br />\nbetween them despite their obvious differences, lead astray<br />\ninto the real world.<br />\nA little later on we learn that<br />\nMolina has been solicited by the<br />\nwarden to act as a police plant<br />\nin order to extract information<br />\nfrom Valentin regarding the opposition movement. By aiding<br />\nthe police Molina is promised<br />\nan early pardon which would<br />\nhelp his ailing mother recover.<br />\nThe conflict is clear: Molina<br />\nfinds himself confronted with a<br />\ndecision that becomes more and<br />\nmore unbearable to make as he<br />\nand Valentin grow closer in<br />\nfriendship. At what point you<br />\nmight ask does a person place<br />\nhis welfare secondary to his<br />\ndevotion to another person?<br />\nPuig examines this question in<br />\ndepth in a fascinating, adventurous manner.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/25<br />\nThe<br />\nDental<br />\nReferral<br />\nService<br />\nwill find<br />\nthe dentist<br />\nthat's r[ght<br />\nfor .yoU!<br />\n<br />\nROTUNDA<br />\nWEDNESDAY NOON SERIES<br />\npresented by<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\nDental<br />\nReferral Service<br />\n<br />\n\"MOVIES: THE DAILY CRITIC'S PERSPECTIVE\"<br />\n<br />\n653-3445<br />\nM-F 8-4<br />\n<br />\nFEBRUARY, 5 NOON<br />\nGarrett Room, Milton S.

So was the<br />\nlate Sandy Denny, a vocalist<br />\nwhom Merchant's singing<br />\nsometimes brings to mind. Fairport specialized in redoing<br />\n<br />\ntraditional folk songs; often, it<br />\nwas hard to determine which of<br />\nthe music was original and<br />\nwhich was traditional. Some of<br />\nthe Maniacs' songs have that<br />\ntimeless quality as well, making<br />\nBoyd an apt choice.<br />\n\"He liked us from early on,\"<br />\nsays Lombardo. \"He has his<br />\nown record label, Hannibal<br />\nRecords, and his office in<br />\nManhattan is on the same floor<br />\nas our booking agent's. Our<br />\nagent played our tape for Joe<br />\nBoyd, saying 'it's like the punk<br />\nFairport' and all this. He expressed an interest in working<br />\nwith us.\"<br />\nThat was fine with the<br />\nManiacs, but their record label,<br />\nsays Lombardo, \"[was] going<br />\n'no, no way.' They didn't think<br />\nhe was commercially viable. He<br />\ndidn't make hit records. But we<br />\ndidn't want one of these 80s<br />\nproducers with a big drum<br />\nsound. We didn't want our<br />\nrecord to sound like Tears For<br />\nFears.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe band won out, and<br />\nshortly after Boyd was contracted to do \"The Wishing<br />\nChair,\" R.E.M. signed him up<br />\nto produce their third album,<br />\n\"Fables of the Reconstruction.\"<br />\n\"They called us and wanted<br />\nto make sure it was all right<br />\nwith us,\" says Lombardo of<br />\nR.E.M. \"So many of the articles written about.us mention<br />\nR.E.M.., and I think they realized<br />\nthat if they used this producer, they knew their record<br />\nwould come out first, and it<br />\nwould look like we were using<br />\nR.E.M.'s producer.\"<br />\n\"In a way, a lot of articles<br />\nhave said that. But it doesn't<br />\nmatter, you know, it only seems<br />\nnatural that bands who have<br />\nsimilar ideas about music,<br />\nsimilar ideas about how to<br />\nwork and how to achieve what<br />\nthey're trying to do, would<br />\ngravitate towards the same kind<br />\nof people.\"<br />\n\"The Wishing Chair\" was<br />\nmade without aspirations of<br />\n<br />\nTop 40 stardom, but Lombardo adds that \"I think many of<br />\nour songs, like 'Can't Ignore<br />\nThe Train' or 'Tension Makes<br />\nA Tangle,' are pretty<br />\nuniversal\u2014I don't think they're<br />\nthreatening to anybody.

CRAMER<br />\n<br />\nThe Academic Council has recommended to<br />\nPresident Gordon that Hopkins admit women<br />\nundergraduates for the Fall term of next year.<br />\nThe Council's recommendations, passed in<br />\nits Wednesday meeting, call for Gordon to<br />\nappoint a \"task force committee\" to report<br />\nto the Academic Council with full details on<br />\nthe ,institution of general undergraduate coeducation.<br />\nUntil this task force completes its work ,it<br />\nwill not be known how many women will be<br />\nadmitted and in which classes, or if the total<br />\nsize of the undergraduate beidy will be changed.<br />\n\"Some Women\"<br />\nThe Council, however, did specify that<br />\nI wanted \"some women\" to be admitted for<br />\nenrollment next year. The statement released<br />\nby Dean Kimball's office yesterday said that<br />\nit was the Council's intent that Hopkins \"proceed as rapidly as feasible to a significant proportion of females in the undergraduate body.\"<br />\nCouncil members were generally unwilling to<br />\ntalk about the decision yesterday. The members<br />\nof the task force have not been named by<br />\nthe President. The recommendations of the<br />\nAcademic Council must be approved by Gordon<br />\nend the Board of Trustees before they may be<br />\nected upon. Although Gordon was unavailable<br />\nfor comment yesterday, it is assumed that he<br />\nwill react favorably to the recommendations.<br />\nThe next meeting of the Board of Trustees will<br />\ntake place on November 10.<br />\nThe task force will consist of two members<br />\nof the faculty, two undergraduates, one rep-<br />\n<br />\nthe Freshmen class more than any other.<br />\nAccording to Homewood House sources,President Gordon views the task force as responsible<br />\nfor reporting on every aspect of the changes<br />\nrequired for coeducation. This indicates that<br />\nthe committee will look into everything from<br />\nalterations in the curriculum to placing<br />\n\"men\" and \"women\" signs on the doors of<br />\nlavatories.<br />\nAdministrators have been looking into the<br />\nproblems and possibilities of undergraduate coeducation for some time. Recently, the<br />\nAcademic Council affirmed undergraduate coeducation \"in principle.\"<br />\n<br />\nresentative from Dean Kimball's office, and one<br />\nrepresentative from the Office of Robert F.<br />\nKerley, the Vice-President for Administration.<br />\n\"Soon,\"Very Soon<br />\n<br />\nDirector of Admissions William Brinkley said that<br />\nthat he would meet. the committee's recommendations \"soon\" in order to do an effective job of recruiting for the Fall term. \"I'm<br />\nnot ready to move until I get the answers,\"<br />\nhe said. Another administrative source said<br />\nthat the report of the task force would probably<br />\nhave to be submitted by November 15 for<br />\ncoeducation to be successfully implemented<br />\nnext year.<br />\nBrinkley was enthusiastic about the possibilities which coeducation would provide for<br />\nHopkins. He said he wanted to see it become<br />\npart of \"our total program.\" He also stated<br />\nthat it might benefit the recruiting efforts of<br />\nthe ,University by making Hopkins more attractive to men. Ronald Owens, Assistant Director<br />\nof Admissions, said that the coeducation move<br />\nwould indicate a general improvement in the<br />\nsocial conditions at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nNo Merger<br />\nThere had been discussion of the feasibility<br />\nof merging with Goucher College instead of<br />\nadmitting women to Hopkins. It was felt by<br />\nsome that because Goucher already had all of<br />\nthe facilities which women require, Hopkins<br />\nwould be wiser to attempt the merger.<br />\nThe faculty at Hopkins, however, was largely<br />\nagainst the move. There was a fear that faculty<br />\nmembers here would lose the control which<br />\nthey exercise over curriculum and program requirements if the university merged with<br />\nGoucher. Many faculty members were upset<br />\nover the types of courses offered in the<br />\nGoucher-Hopkins cooperative program.<br />\nIn addition, problems of transportation between the two campuses would have proved<br />\ndifficult to eliminate. Had Hopkins amid Goucher<br />\nmerged, the university would- have accrued no<br />\nfinancial advantages. Goucher's endowment is<br />\nsmall compared to that of Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nAlready Interviewing<br />\nBrinkley stated that the University was already receiving letters from women. His staff<br />\nhas already been talking to female high school<br />\nseniors. However, he stated, that he also wished<br />\nto enroll transfer students. \"I think we could<br />\nget some fine young ladies through transfer,\"<br />\nhe said. No one was willing to speculate on<br />\nhow many women would be enrolled in each<br />\nclass.

In<br />\nearly December, Albee picked<br />\na number of potential actors<br />\nand directors out of the ranks<br />\nof auditioning undergrads and<br />\nsix student plays out of a pool<br />\nof submissions. Intersession<br />\nmeant a rigorous course of<br />\nwork with Albee for these<br />\naspiring playwrights, actors,<br />\nand directors. Finally, the fruit<br />\nof their labor comes to the<br />\nstage\u2014this weekend: Friday,<br />\nSaturday, and Sunday at 8 p.m.<br />\nin the L/V room.<br />\nThe past two Albee productions have been enjoyable affairs featuring good acting and<br />\nalways interesting, occasionally brilliant, writing. The coordinator of this program,<br />\nWriting Seminars professor<br />\nRobert Arellano, hints that this<br />\nweekend's shows may be the<br />\nbest yet. The past two years<br />\nhave helped smooth out the<br />\nworkings of the system and<br />\nAlbee's level of supervision has<br />\nbeen the most productive thus<br />\nfar.<br />\nTwo of the chosen plays<br />\ncome from Arellano's Introductory Playwrighting class,<br />\n<br />\ntwo come from his Advanced<br />\nclass, and one comes from his<br />\nIntermediate class. One play,<br />\nJohn Lasseigne's Three Voices<br />\nwas submitted independently.<br />\nLasseigne's play is directed<br />\nby John Park. About a murder,<br />\nits cast of characters include the<br />\nmurderer, the victim, and the<br />\nvictim's son; the play, however,<br />\ntakes place eight years after the<br />\nmurder\u2014figure that out. Sandrine Tiller's Like a Fish in the<br />\nWater is directed by Jack<br />\nTomalis and is about, simply,<br />\na man, a woman, and some<br />\nfish. Herman Ayayo directed<br />\ngrad student James Boylan's<br />\nplay, All Soul's Day, which is<br />\nabout two people that meet in<br />\na church on All Soul's Day.<br />\nThe remaining three plays are<br />\nNo Stopping Any Time, by<br />\nDuncan Smith, directed by<br />\nAnne-Marie Ulrich, and about<br />\ntwo schoolmates who meet<br />\nafter ten years; A Process ofInspiration, by Herman Ayayo,<br />\ndirected by Robbie Simon, and<br />\nabout a novelist who runs dry<br />\nand his search for inspiration;<br />\nand Jay/Alfred by David<br />\nCharles, directed by Rob Grey,<br />\nand about two guys and their<br />\nattitude(s) toward the opposite<br />\nsex.<br />\nThis weekend's production is<br />\nsponsored by the Writing<br />\nSeminars department. There<br />\nwill be no charge for admission.<br />\n<br />\nThe Maniacs of Folk Pop<br />\nby Sue Trowbridge<br />\n<br />\n\"Are you one of the<br />\nmaniacs?\"<br />\nOne of 8x10's employees,<br />\nbusily transporting cases of<br />\nbeer from the storeroom in<br />\npreparation for that night's<br />\nconcert, is eyeing a man who<br />\nreally looks far too ordinary to<br />\nbe a maniac, or even play in a<br />\nband called 10,000 Maniacs. A<br />\nmohawk or torn T-shirt would<br />\nseem more appropriate. Who<br />\nwould expect a group named<br />\n10,000 Maniacs to specialize in<br />\nlilting folk melodies and guitar<br />\nbased pop music that nobody<br />\nwould ever dream of slamdancing to?<br />\nOne of the Maniacs' two<br />\nguitarists, John Lombardo,<br />\npromises that the sound check<br />\nwon't be too loud. \"You've<br />\nheard our wimpy album,\" he<br />\nsays, plopping down on a couch<br />\nwith his guitar and his Six<br />\nMillion Dollar Man lunchbox<br />\nfull of strings and various tools.<br />\nHe is the scruffier half of the<br />\nManiacs' guitar section\u2014<br />\nRobert Buck, who also plays<br />\nthe mandolin, is the only one in<br />\nthe band who you'd really expect to be a musician, and<br />\nthat's mostly because one of his<br />\nears is double-pierced. In his<br />\ncrisp white shirt and tie, he<br />\nstands out from the other, more<br />\ncasual Maniacs.<br />\nLombardo starts _replacing a<br />\nstring on his twelve-string<br />\n<br />\nFinkle's Flawless on Cello<br />\nby Jason Hanson<br />\n<br />\nThose in attendance of the<br />\nShriver Hall Concert Series'<br />\nmost recent offering last Sunday night were treated to a<br />\nmasterful performance by<br />\ncellist David Finkel, winner of<br />\nthe 1985 New England Conservatory/Piatigorsky Prize. The<br />\nprize, won through a competition, is named after the late<br />\ncello virtuoso Gregor Piatigorsky and is awarded to the cellist<br />\nwho excels simultaneously as a<br />\nsoloist, as a chamber musician,<br />\nand as a teacher.<br />\nFinkel began his training<br />\nwith his father at an early age<br />\nand has studied under teachers<br />\nas distinguished as Msistlav<br />\nRostropovich, present conductor of the National Symphony.<br />\nHe is currently a member of the<br />\nEverson Quartet and is an Artist in Residence of the<br />\nChamber Music Society of the<br />\nLincoln Center.<br />\nPianist Wu Han performed<br />\nwith Finkel. Han, a graduate of<br />\nthe Hartt School of Music, is a<br />\nskilled accompanist and has<br />\nmade numerous appearances<br />\nwith the Emerson String<br />\nQuartet.<br />\nSunday's program began<br />\nwith three classical works: one<br />\neach of Beethoven, Schumann,<br />\nand Brahms. Standing out<br />\namong these was the \"Sonata<br />\nin Minor for cello and piano,<br />\nOp. 83\" of Johannes Brahms.<br />\nFinkel brought out the<br />\nsublime side of the cello with<br />\n<br />\nhis reading of the piece. His<br />\nplaying of the deep, rich<br />\nmelody of the first section<br />\ndisplayed that its theme,<br />\nalthough written almost entirely<br />\nin the lower range of the instrument, can be quite lyrical and<br />\noccasionally even romantic.<br />\nFinkel's faultless playing of the<br />\nmany double-stops in the midst<br />\nof this section, as well as his<br />\ncrisp execution of the pizzacato<br />\npassages, added vivid color to<br />\nthe piece. In the second section<br />\nof the piece, Finkel starkly contrasted the light and graceful<br />\nfigures against heavier romantic themes displaying his<br />\nmultifaceted ability. The intense fugue which began the<br />\nthird section allowed Finkel to<br />\ndemonstrate his dexterity, requiring the use of the entire<br />\nfingerboard of the instrument<br />\nto create polyphonic melodies<br />\nfrom a single instrument.<br />\nThe second half of the program contained more recent<br />\nworks including Benjamin Britten's \"Sonata in C for Cello<br />\nand Piano.\" The style of this<br />\npiece was in complete contrast<br />\nto the previous works.<br />\nBritten's work begins fairly<br />\nsimply with a motive, or first<br />\ntheme, consisting of two scale<br />\nsteps. Though elementary,<br />\nthese serve as the subject of<br />\nmany variations throughout all<br />\nfour movements of the piece.<br />\nTo add further interest to the<br />\ntheme, Britten employs many<br />\nof the embellishments available<br />\nto stringed instruments such as<br />\npizzacato (plucked) playing,<br />\n<br />\nharmonics, and glissando<br />\n(sliding) fingering.<br />\nAs encore pieces Finkel performed Rachmaninoff's splendid and lyrical \"Prelude\"<br />\nfollowed by Rostropovich's<br />\n\"Humeresque,\" an extremely<br />\ncomplicated piece of deceptive<br />\nlevity.

When I did,<br />\nI was somewhat disappointed.<br />\nThe book contains many of the<br />\npopular segments of the show,<br />\nin pictorial form. A lot of it is<br />\nfunny, although most is much<br />\nfunnier on T.V.<br />\n. The book begins with an<br />\neditor's foreward by Merrill<br />\nMarkoe, head writer for Late<br />\nNight. Her piece on \"What the<br />\nDogs Have Taught Me\" is<br />\ngreat. The next section, \"Opening Remarks,\" is a collection of<br />\nLetterman's best one-liners<br />\nfrom the beginning of the<br />\nshow. I found many of them<br />\nvery funny, but that may be<br />\nbecause I pictured Letterman<br />\nsaying each as I read them.<br />\nThat wonderful sarcasm in Letterman's voice and his priceless<br />\nfacial expressions have a way of<br />\nmaking an unfunny joke funny.<br />\nI honestly don't know whether<br />\nI would have found these jokes<br />\nnearly as amusing had I not<br />\nbeen familiar with Letterman's<br />\nstyle.<br />\nSeveral of the other segments<br />\nfare better, since they have pic-<br />\n<br />\ntures to accompany the jokes.<br />\nThese include \"The Museum of<br />\nthe Hard to Believe,\" \"New<br />\nGift Ideas,\" \"Dave's Toy<br />\nShop,\" and \"New Medical<br />\nAids.\" Some of the more<br />\namusing visuals included the<br />\nQ-Tip<br />\nLaLanne<br />\n\"Jack<br />\nDispenser,\" the \"Willie Ax,\"<br />\nand \"Lifelike Duplicates of Internal Organs.\" Many were<br />\nmade funnier with pictures of<br />\nLetterman demonstrating the<br />\nitems, although again, it's not<br />\nthe same as seeing it on T.V.<br />\nLetterman's<br />\nof<br />\nTwo<br />\n\"movies\" are included here.<br />\n\"They Took my Show Away<br />\n(an Afterschool Special),\" and<br />\n\"Dog Poetry\" work almost as<br />\nwell as they do on T.V., since<br />\nthe pictures and captions cover<br />\nthe humor pretty well. Still,<br />\nthey are lacking Letterman's<br />\nvoice in the narration, a factor<br />\nthat increases the humor level<br />\nconsiderably.<br />\nSeveral multiple-choice<br />\nsprinkled<br />\nare<br />\nquizzes<br />\nthroughout the book, covering<br />\nsubjects such as T.V., summer,<br />\nand going back to school. I<br />\nfound these very funny. Unlike<br />\nthe other segments, these actually seemed funnier in print.<br />\nAlso sprinkled in among the<br />\nother segments are pictorials on<br />\n\"etiquette\" in hotels, subways,<br />\nelevators, T.V. audiences, and<br />\nbeing a talk-show guest. The<br />\n<br />\npictures of Letterman, Paul<br />\nShaffer, and Larry \"Bud\"<br />\nMelman are hysterical.<br />\nHowever, the sections on talkshow and audience etiquette<br />\nprobably would be incomprehensible to someone not<br />\nfamiliar with Late Night.<br />\nI found the section entitled<br />\n\"Camping with Barry White\"<br />\nunfunny. Of course, since I'm<br />\nnot familiar with Mr. Barry<br />\nWhite, I probably wouldn't<br />\nhave thought it was funny on<br />\nthe show, either. Not<br />\neverything on the show is funny, but, again, they should have<br />\nincluded only the best segments<br />\nof Late Night in this book.<br />\nAn entire chunk of the book<br />\nis devoted to sections written by<br />\neach of the 15 writers. Ironically, I found this section the least<br />\nfunny of the entire book. Many<br />\nwere too long, and seemed to<br />\ncontain inside jokes. The book<br />\nwould not have suffered had<br />\nthey left out this section \"The Muppets All Die and Go<br />\nto Hell,\" and \"A Child's First<br />\nentirely.<br />\nA comic section entitled Book of Smoking\" are par\"How to Be a Responsible T.V. ticularly amusing. Actual letters<br />\nViewer\" was one of the funniest are pictured in the Viewer Mail<br />\nin the book. \"Dave's 1\"-,, section, with all of Letterman's<br />\nusual silliness following each.<br />\nFunhouse\" and \"Frani,<br />\nIn general, Late Night with<br />\nFred\" also translate well in<br />\nDavid Letterman doesn't fare<br />\nprinted form.<br />\nTwo all-time favorites,\"The well in print. Of course, the onLate Night Bookmobile,\" and ly truly objective review of this<br />\n\"Viewer Mail\" are also includ- book would be by someone<br />\ned. Some of the books, such as who has never seen the show. I<br />\n<br />\nfor one don't know any such<br />\nperson, so I tried to be as objective as possible. I think that<br />\nif this book were made into one<br />\nof Letterman's T.V.'specials, it<br />\nwould be his best ever. Even<br />\nthough Late Night with David<br />\nLetterman: The Book isn't as<br />\nfunny as the show itself, I<br />\nrecommend it for all die-hard<br />\nLetterman fans.<br />\n<br />\nManuel Puig: Continuing a Nifty Tradition<br />\nKiss of the Spider Woman.<br />\nby Manuel Puig<br />\nRandom House, $3.95.<br />\n<br />\nKISS Of THE<br />\nSPIDED WOMAN<br />\n<br />\nby Gil Israeli<br />\nA good many novelists lament the day they let their work<br />\nslip into the hands of a reputed<br />\nfilm maker, but Manuel Puig is<br />\nnot one of them. Puig is an experimental realist from Argentina whose latest work, Kiss of<br />\nthe Spider Woman, continues<br />\nthe tradition he set with his<br />\nearlier novel, The Buenos Aires<br />\nAffair. Both are banned in<br />\nArgentina because of their<br />\npolitical perspectives and Puig<br />\nhas wisely chosen to make his<br />\nhome in New York. Smart<br />\nman.<br />\nPuig's approach is different<br />\nto say the least, but once one<br />\nhas grown accustomed to his<br />\nunusual story-telling style, he<br />\noccupies the reader's senses and<br />\nis fully absorbing. He likes to<br />\nuse the debris of the<br />\nand<br />\nworld\u2014newspaper<br />\nmagazine clippings, police and<br />\nhospital reports, shopping<br />\nlists\u2014and lets them all tell their<br />\nown stories without his comments or intrusions.<br />\nKiss of the Spider Woman, is<br />\nactually a running dialogue between two men in a prison cell.<br />\nThe occupants are Molina and<br />\n<br />\n'Valentin.

The<br />\nMuseum is located on the<br />\ngrounds of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in the<br />\nDistrict of Columbia. I had<br />\ndecided that the stories must<br />\nsurely be exaggerations; the<br />\nidea of a museum displaying a<br />\nthree-headed baby soaking in a<br />\njar of formaldehyde was too<br />\nbizarre.

These unfortunate rises were paralleled<br />\nwith the increased military<br />\nspending.<br />\nSidel cited statistics showing<br />\nthat while there were more<br />\nresearch and development (R<br />\nand D)funds, military R and D<br />\nincreased 65 percent while all<br />\nother R and D's suffered a 30<br />\npercent decrease. He implied<br />\nthat this discrepancy was due to<br />\na disproportionate amount of<br />\nthe military R and D funds<br />\ndirected toward designing objects with \"ridiculous specifications which would never be<br />\nneeded.\" Sidel also stated that<br />\nthe Soviet Union was undergoing a similar detrimental social<br />\ntrend due to its own<br />\nmilitarization.<br />\nSidel conceded that jobs were<br />\ncreated by high military spen-<br />\n<br />\nding. However, if the money<br />\nwas channeled into human service programs, jobs would be<br />\nproduced as well, he said.

This<br />\nnew concept could possibly<br />\nrevolutionize the basketball<br />\nplay in the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center. Sources inside<br />\nthe Athletic Center have confirmed that no particular individual has been credited as<br />\nthe originator of this new<br />\ntheory, but rather it was a team<br />\nrealization. This new concept<br />\nhas been Defense. That's<br />\ncapital D...and everything else<br />\nin the lower case. Okay so Dr.<br />\nNaismith does not have to be<br />\nnotified about this one; and<br />\n<br />\ncoaches from across the nation<br />\nare not going to visit Hopkins<br />\nto see this marvel, but the wins<br />\nare beginning to come for the<br />\nBlue Jays and defense has been<br />\nthe cause.<br />\n\"We played as tough a<br />\ndefense against Franklin and<br />\nMarshall as I have seen since<br />\nI've been here,\" says coach<br />\nNap Doherty. The Jays won<br />\nthat one 67-66 with an unlikely<br />\nhero. Terry Ryan put the Jays<br />\nahead with a bucket with eight<br />\nseconds remaining. Jedan<br />\nPhillips, who had 14 points on<br />\nthe night, added a free throw<br />\nwith three seconds left to ice the<br />\ngame. Why Ryan instead of<br />\nDave Wilson who usually is the<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nRalph Horne looks to jam in the Ursinus game.<br />\n<br />\nchoice to win it or lose it?<br />\n\"We were in a spread and<br />\nTerry took it in and beat his<br />\nman,\" said Doherty.<br />\nTwo days later, Swarthmore<br />\nwas in town to challenge<br />\nHopkins and once again the<br />\nJays pulled out a victory in the<br />\nfinal seconds. This time,<br />\nWilson seized the opportunity<br />\nand hit a 20 foot jumper with<br />\nnine seconds left for the win.<br />\nBack to back victories within<br />\nthe conference have left the<br />\nJays with a realistic shot in the<br />\nMAC race. The big news over<br />\nthe holidays is that Widener<br />\nwho usually stomps everyone in<br />\nthe MAC has lost two games<br />\nwith only three victories to<br />\nshow.<br />\nIt has been a long time since<br />\nWidener was 3-2 and thus the<br />\nMAC race should be a good<br />\none. Washington College is<br />\natop the league at 6-0. Ursinus<br />\nwho comes to Homewood this<br />\nweek for a big game is 4-1.<br />\nWidener is behind Ursinus and<br />\nHopkins is 2-2. Sure the Jays<br />\nhave a long way to go but at<br />\nleast they control their own<br />\ndestiny. If Hopkins pulls off<br />\nthe upset of Ursinus the Jays<br />\nare very much within reach.<br />\nThe momentum is certainly in<br />\nHopkins' corner with the two<br />\nconsecutive last second victories.<br />\nLearning from those two victories is of the most importance<br />\nfor the Jays. Doherty's squad<br />\nwas forced to play without<br />\nRalph Horne who twisted an<br />\nankle in a contest with Messiah<br />\nCollege. Horne had been<br />\naveraging 14 points a game, second to Wilson with a 16 point<br />\naverage. Without Horne, the<br />\nJays featured a more balanced<br />\nscoring attack along with the<br />\nstepped-up defense. Against<br />\nF&M, Wilson, Charlie Sikor-<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nDave Wilson puts one up against Ursinus on Wednesday night(Hopkins<br />\nlost 52-49). The senior, who leads Hopkins in scoring with 16 ppg, hit<br />\na 20 footer with nine seconds left to beat Swarthmore last Saturday.<br />\n<br />\nsky, and Jedan Phillips each hit<br />\ndouble figures with 16, 15, and<br />\n14 points respectively. In the<br />\nSwarthmore contest, 5 Jays<br />\nwere in double figures and Bud<br />\nPygon was the leading scorer.<br />\nBoth Pygon and Phillips have<br />\nseen much more time of late<br />\nand they are both making the<br />\nmost of it.<br />\nThe balanced scoring is a major change from the early<br />\nseason Hopkins team which<br />\nhad Horne and Wilson as the<br />\nonly two scorers.<br />\n<br />\n\"Dave and Ralph both got<br />\noff to good starts and I think<br />\neveryone sort of looked for<br />\nthem on offense.\" said Chris<br />\nWasson. \"Now we're looking<br />\nfor all five players on the floor<br />\nand it's working.\"<br />\nIn the absence of Horne,<br />\nKevin Sottak has seen much<br />\nmore time which is a big reason<br />\nfor the better defense.

The Jay's victory over<br />\nGettysburg is their first in five<br />\nyears against the Bullets.<br />\nFirst, however, the Jays<br />\ndowned Eastern College by a<br />\ndecisive 45-10 score. Senior tricaptain Neil Porter began with<br />\na pin in 1:04 to put Hopkins up<br />\n6-0. Forfeits to tri-captain Jules<br />\nShin at 126 and Alan Ronson at<br />\n134 ran the score to 18-0, and<br />\nafter Eastern scored a win at<br />\n142, Houman Tavaf's pin at<br />\n150 in 1:50 gave the Blue Jays<br />\na 24-4 lead.<br />\nAn Eastern pin at 158 pulled<br />\nthem to 24-10, but the rest of<br />\nthe match belonged to Hopkins. Mike Barnum registered a<br />\nquick :38 pin at 167, and Bill<br />\nNolan recorded a technical fall<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\nThe grapplers have compiled an impressive 11-5 record so far this season, in 4:40 at 177. Brian Bolinger,<br />\ncoming off their tri-meet wins over Gettysburg and Eastern on Wednes- a tri-captain at 190, made it<br />\nday. The squad returns to the mats tomorrow for a road contest against three straight falls, scoring with<br />\nfierce rival Susquehanna.<br />\na headlock in just 40 seconds.<br />\nTom Kalup then closed out the<br />\n<br />\nLady Hoopsters Look For 1st Win<br />\nby Christopher Szeles<br />\nDespite the women's basketball<br />\nteam's horrendous 0-14 start,<br />\nCoach Kay Fowler Dressler is<br />\npleased with her team's \"ability to enjoy themselves working<br />\nand playing for their first win.\"<br />\nShe attributes their lack of<br />\nspeed as their main weakness.<br />\nIn every game the defense has<br />\nlapsed. \"Good teams are able<br />\nto run the ball with great success; we are not getting back on<br />\ndefense.\" Leading by 3 points<br />\nover Dickinson in the second<br />\nhalf, Hopkins allowed an incredible 29 to 4 Dickinson<br />\nspurt. Offensively, Coach<br />\nDressler is looking for<br />\nStephanie Spengler to develop.<br />\nDressler desperately needs an<br />\ninside scoring threat.<br />\nThe Swarthmore Quakers<br />\nunmercifully trounced the Blue<br />\nJays in their last home game.<br />\nGood passing shredded the<br />\nHopkins defense enabling<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore to take a 34-point<br />\nlead. Hopkins was plagued by<br />\nnumerous turnovers and bad<br />\nshot selection. The final score<br />\nwas 79-55.<br />\nDespite their weaknesses,<br />\nDressler sees much potential in<br />\nher young spirited squad. Cindy Harper is averaging 20.5<br />\npoints a game leading Hopkins'<br />\nscorers. Harper broke the single<br />\ngame scoring mark for Hopkins<br />\nwith her 39 points against the<br />\nfierce Notre Dame squad.<br />\nHopkins lost the bittersweet<br />\ncontest by 4 points. \"Harper<br />\nputs on an incredible offensive<br />\ndisplay at each game. Her fast<br />\nbreaks and creative moves to<br />\nthe hoop distinguish herself.\"<br />\nJeannie Clark strung 2 solid<br />\ngames together to score 34<br />\npoints. Dressler feels \"Clark<br />\nhas developed much and has<br />\nstarted to contribute greatly to<br />\nthe offense with her good outside touch.\"<br />\nFreshman Stephanie Speng-<br />\n<br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nFriday, January 31<br />\nWomen's Squash vs. Swarthmore<br />\n<br />\n4.00 p.m.(A)<br />\n<br />\nSaturday, February 1<br />\n8.00 p.m. (A)<br />\nMen's Basketball vs. Widener<br />\nMen's J.V.

The Bullets spotted<br />\nHopkins a 12-0 lead as they<br />\nforfeited to Porter at 118, and<br />\nSanjiv Patel also recieved a bye<br />\nat 126. Shin, wrestling up a<br />\nweight class at 134, wrestled a<br />\nfine match in scoring a 11-2 major decision to make the score<br />\n16-0. Gettysburg closed in with<br />\nvery close decisions at 142, 150,<br />\nand 158 to narrow the margin<br />\nto 16-9. Two of those wins were<br />\nby a single point,<br />\nHopkins proceeded to clinch<br />\nthe match, however, as Barnum<br />\nwrestled well in scoring a 13-5<br />\ndecision at 167 to put the Jays<br />\nahead 20-9, and Nolan came<br />\nthrough with another 15 point<br />\ntechnical fall at 177. Two more<br />\nextremely close wins for Gettysburg at 190 and Hwt. closed<br />\nout the match, and Hopkins<br />\nwas a 26-15 victor.<br />\nThe Blue Jay wrestlers have<br />\nwon 9 of their 12 January matches, and are bidding to top last<br />\nseason's record of 13 wins for<br />\nthe season. Coach Andy Janquitto offered several reasons<br />\nfor the team's recent success.<br />\nThe return of fifth-year senior<br />\nNolan, Barnum's transition<br />\nfrom 177 to 167, and the fine<br />\nwrestling from captains Porter,<br />\nShin, and Bolinger have been<br />\nmajor reasons. Moreover, outstanding performances and<br />\ndepth at all weight classes make<br />\n<br />\nler has played excellent defense,<br />\nshowing her ability to get back<br />\non defense. She swatted away<br />\n5 shots against Dominican and<br />\nhad 3 blocks in the first half<br />\nagainst Dickinson. Dressler<br />\nfeels she must still mature offensively despite some good<br />\nefforts.<br />\nRachelle LaForce had a<br />\ntypical outstanding game offensively against Swarthmore scoring 17 points. Dressler has great<br />\nconfidence in LaForce's outside<br />\nshot. Hec main weakness is her<br />\ninability to get back on defense<br />\nconsistently. Her rebounding<br />\nprowess is greatly needed.<br />\n\"Martina Waluk has been an<br />\noffensive threat coming off the<br />\nbench. Susie Stickney has also<br />\nadded quality minutes, playing<br />\nan unrelenting defense.\"<br />\nHopkins has two upcoming<br />\nhome games against Lebanon<br />\nValley on Feb. 1, and Western<br />\nMD. on Feb. 4, both at 7 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nthis one of the best Hopkins<br />\nsquads in recent years. Seniors<br />\nKen Conner at 134 and Joe<br />\nPaykin at 142 and sophomores<br />\nYukio Sonada at 158 and Rob<br />\nDowning at 167 have wrestled<br />\nconsistently well all season, and<br />\nHeavyweight Kalup, a 5th place<br />\nfinisher at last year's MAC<br />\ntournament, is a serious contender for that title this season.<br />\nFinally, a more rigorous conditioning program, dubbed<br />\n\"Death Camp II\" by one<br />\nwrestler, has made Hopkins a<br />\nvery tough wrestling team.<br />\nThe Jays' January schedule<br />\nalso included wins over Loyola<br />\nand Hampden-Sydney at home,<br />\na victory over Messiah College,<br />\nand a sweep of a quad against<br />\nBaptist Bible, Penn St.-Ogonty<br />\nand Haverford.

The dish then<br />\ntransmits the numbers to a<br />\nreceiver stationed at the base of<br />\nthe antenna where the numbers<br />\nare decoded and sent on there<br />\nway out the antenna.<br /><br />\nThe whole system, according<br />\nto Creagh, is \"a lot quieter\"<br />\nbecause it eliminates the<br />\nbackground noise generated<br />\nduring conventional cable or<br />\nradio station-to-antenna links.<br />\nDiscussing the topic of student involvement in the new<br />\nWJHU,Creagh reaffirmed his<br />\nposition that students, in<br />\ngeneral, will have to compete<br />\nfor jobs against all other applicants for any given position.<br />\nWith the exception of three<br />\npositions which have been set<br />\naside exclusively for students,<br />\nCreagh says, \"I intend to be<br />\nblind in hiring practices with<br />\nrespect to students.\"<br />\nAccording to Creagh, once<br />\nthe station boosts power,<br />\nuniversity administrators expect it to become financially<br />\nsomewhat self-sufficient.<br /><br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\nDavid Creagh, general manager of WJHU who recently announced that<br />\nthe station will not be boosting power until June.<br /><br />\nWJHU Programming Schedule<br />\n12:00 am<br />\n1:00 am<br />\n2:00 am<br />\n3:00 am<br />\n4:00 am<br />\n5:00 am<br />\n6:00 am<br />\n7:00 am<br />\n8:00 am<br />\n9:00 am<br />\n10:00 am<br />\n11:00 am<br />\n12:00 pm<br />\n1:00 pm<br />\n2:00 pm<br />\n3:00 pm<br />\n4:00 pm<br />\n5:00 pm<br />\n6:00 pm<br />\n7:00 pm<br />\n8:00 pm<br />\n9:00 pm<br />\n10:00 pm<br />\n11:00 pm<br /><br />\nSunday<br />\nTBA<br />\nTBA<br />\nTBA<br />\nTBA<br />\nTBA<br />\nTBA<br />\ncla yics<br /><br />\nopera<br />\nopera<br />\nopera<br />\njazz<br />\njazz<br />\njazz<br /><br />\nMonday<br />\njazz<br />\nTBA<br /><br />\nTuesday<br />\njazz<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nWednesday<br />\njazz<br />\ndaisies<br /><br />\nThursday<br />\njazz<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nFriday<br />\njazz<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nTBA/news<br />\nMorning Edition<br /><br />\nclassics/news<br />\nMorning Edition<br /><br />\nclassics/news<br />\nMorning Edition<br /><br />\nclassics/news<br />\nMorning Edition<br /><br />\nclassics/news<br />\nMorning Edition<br />\nI<br /><br />\nclass/nws/traffic<br />\nclassics<br />\nclassics<br />\nnews/classics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nclass/nws/traffic<br />\nclassics<br />\nclassics<br />\nnews/classics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nclass/nws/traffic<br />\nclassics<br />\nclassics<br />\nnews/classics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nclass/nws/traffic<br />\nclassics<br />\nclassics<br />\nnews/classics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nclass/nws/traffic<br />\nclassics<br />\nclassics<br />\nnews/classics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nclass/magazine<br />\nATC<br />\nATC/d. classics<br />\ndinner classics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nclass/magazine<br />\nATC<br />\nATC/d. classics<br />\ndinner classics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\njazz<br /><br />\njazz<br />\n1<br /><br />\nclass/magazine<br />\nATC<br />\nATC/d. classics<br />\ndinner classics<br />\nclassics<br />\n1<br />\njatz<br /><br />\nclass/magazine<br />\nATC<br />\nATC/d. classics<br />\ndinner classics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nclass/magazine<br />\nATC<br />\nATC/d. classics<br />\ndinner classics<br />\nclassics<br />\njazz<br /><br />\njazz<br /><br />\nSaturday<br />\nclassics<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\naudiophile<br />\nclassics<br /><br />\nSmithsonian Curator Discusses Indian Headdresses<br />\nStereotype\" in the Garrett<br />\nRoom of the MSE Library.

He<br />\nexplained that ethnic symbols<br />\ndevelop when sharp distinctions<br />\nbetween cultures exist. The<br />\nheaddress arose as a symbol of<br />\nethnic identity at a time when<br />\npanindian ethnic sentiment<br />\nbegan to overcome loyalty to individual tribes and features of<br />\ndress were becomming important to other American ethnic<br />\ngroups.<br />\nAccording to Sturtevant, the<br />\ndevelopment of the modern<br />\nplains headdress or \"war bonnet,\" now used as a symbol<br />\nboth by and for American Indians, involved at least one major process of cultural feedback. When Brazil was<br />\ndiscovered by Europeans in the<br />\nearly sixteenth century, the<br />\nTupinamba tribe of Indians lived<br /><br />\nthere. These natives wore a<br />\n\"feather crown\" consisting of<br />\na headdress sypporting a<br />\ncylinder of feathers which<br />\nflared at the top.<br />\nSturtevant showed many<br />\nslides both of these actual<br />\nAmerican artifacts and of<br />\nEuropean representations of<br />\nthem.<br />\nOriginally, a major purpose<br />\nof the bonnet was to challenge<br />\nenemy warriors to attempt to<br />\ntake it by killing the wearer.<br />\nIn Europe, over the next 200<br />\nto 250 years, the feather crown,<br />\nskirt, and other ornaments<br />\nbecame symbolic of the<br />\nAmerican native dress, and<br />\neven though various tribes later<br />\ncontacted in the Americas often<br />\ndressed very differently, many<br />\npaintings and woodcuts show<br />\nthem wearing Tupinamba ornaments. Sturtevant explained<br />\nthat at that time in Europe, the<br />\nstatus of individuals was very<br />\nmuch reflected by their mode of<br />\ndress; the words \"costume\"<br />\nand \"custom,\" have a common<br />\nroot in both English and<br />\nFrench.<br />\nThe feather crown was introduced to the Indians of<br />\nEastern North America by<br />\nEuropeans in the seventeenth<br />\nand eighteenth centuries, and<br />\nthese Indians used it as a<br /><br />\ncultural boundary marker.<br />\nThe swept-back war bonnet<br />\nof today is thought to have<br />\noriginated in the Western plains<br />\nof the continent. Although<br />\nseveral painters who traveled<br />\namong the plains Indians portrayed few of these headdresses,<br />\none Indian drew himself in one,<br />\nsuggesting that the bonnet was<br />\nserving as an ethnic symbol accepted by Indians and others<br />\nalike, whether authentically Indian or not.<br />\nTwentieth century eastern Indians began to wear the war<br />\nbonnet and use it as a \"symbol<br />\nof Indianness,\" according to<br />\nSturtevant and shown in several<br />\nof his slides. One eastern Indian<br />\nhad made his headdress from<br />\ninstructions in the Boy Scout<br />\nHandbook\u2014showing that<br />\nmany Indians knew that the<br />\nbonnet was a synthetic smbol,<br />\nbut intentionally used it<br />\nnevertheless.(More recently this<br />\ncentury, it has given way to less<br />\nflamboyant symbols such as<br />\nthin braids.)<br />\nThe next lecture in the series<br />\nwill be given by Professor Franciose Heritier-Auge, the Director of the Laboratoire D'Anthropologie Sociale in Paris, at<br />\n8 p.m. on Wednesday,<br />\nFebruary 19, in the Garrett<br />\nRoom of the MSE library.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br /><br />\nGRO Discusses Changing<br />\nJHU's S.

It's now been 22.<br />\nAt the time, students didn't have any<br />\nparticular reason to doubt what University President Steven Muller said in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission: WJHU would return to the air<br />\nJuly 1 or soon thereafter. That was the<br />\nlast time anyone has been inclined to<br />\nbelieve much of anything the administration has said about the station.<br />\nThe summer came and went, but when<br />\nstudents returned in the fall, some two<br />\nmonths after the station was to have<br />\nreturned to the air, nothing had happened. Mid-terms arrived, but the station<br />\nstill wasn't back. Everybody went home<br />\nfor Thanksgiving\u2014still with no WJHU.<br />\nFinally, in December, about six months<br />\nafter we had been told the station would<br />\nbe back, the University announced that<br />\nit would indeed return\u2014the following<br />\nfall. Now let's remember: this would be<br />\nmore than a year after the administration had first said the station would come<br />\nback on the air.<br />\nIn any event, B.J. Norris, vice president for communications and public affairs, who had been placed in charge of<br />\nthe station, began planning for its return.<br />\n\"Our first priority,\" she said at the time,<br />\n\"is to extend our FCC permit,\" which<br />\nwas due to expire in February, 1985. To<br />\nget an extension required some show of<br />\ninterest in maintaining a station, and sure<br />\nenough the administration suddenly<br />\ndiscovered it could fund a return of the<br />\n10-watt station until the power increase.<br />\nSo that winter the student-run WJHU<br />\nwent back on the air, while the party-line<br />\nwas still that the larger station would<br />\nstart in the fall.<br />\nEnter Dave Creagh. Hired during the<br />\nsummer as WJHU's new General<br />\nManager, he came with a guarantee that<br />\nthe station would start up in the... no,<br />\nnot fall\u2014spring. That required another<br />\nextension from the FCC, which was by<br />\nnow said to be less than pleased with<br />\nHopkins. But it granted the extension<br />\nanyway, adding that this was the last one<br />\nthe University would ever get. No pro-<br /><br />\nblem, said the administration, the<br />\n25,000-watt WJHU will go on the air by<br />\nthe time the extension expires March 17.<br />\nWell... uh... maybe.<br />\nNow comes word the new station will<br />\nmiss the March deadline. Instead, the<br />\nnewest prediction is that the station will<br />\nget its power increase\u2014now lowered to<br />\n10,000 watts\u2014in June. Well, we'll<br />\nbelieve it when we see it.<br />\nWho is responsible for this mess?<br />\nWell, to be frank, we don't know. If the<br />\npower increase does come through in<br />\nJune\u2014a big if\u2014Creagh will have been<br />\non the job for less than a year; he claims<br />\nit normally takes 18-24 months to put<br />\ntogether such a station. The simple fact<br />\nis we don't know enough about organizing a major radio station to assign the<br />\nblame. But we do know enough about<br />\nmanaging a project\u2014any project\u2014to<br />\nknow that there is blame to be assigned.<br />\nThe process has simply taken too long.<br />\nWe tend to believe Creagh's claim that<br />\nmost of this is not his fault. He is obviously a driven man, one unaccustomed to failure. Instead, we believe the<br />\nlion's share of the blame must go to Norris, who dawdled too long in the early<br />\nplanning stages, and, ultimately, to<br />\nUniversity President Steven Muller. As<br />\nwith the entire university, WJHU is<br />\nMuller's responsibility, and he must accept the blame.<br />\nBut worst of all, it's clear in retrospect<br />\nthat the administration simply lied<br />\nthrough its teeth. It's obvious that the<br />\npeople who run Hopkins haven't<br />\ndistinguished themselves in the WJHU<br />\naffair, but surely the University's top officers are not so stupid that they sincerely<br />\nestimated a two-year job could be completed in three months.<br />\nThe administration's reputation is<br />\nhardly one of striking efficiency, but<br />\nWJHU has become the piece de<br />\nresistance of bumbling. The whole thing<br />\nhas become almost a parody\u2014a bit of<br />\neomic relief from the more serious worries of tuition increases and South<br />\nAfrican investments. Perhaps Creagh<br />\ncan eventually pull the thing together and<br />\ncreate a successful station; we hope so.<br />\nBut in the meantime, don't hold your<br />\nbreath for June.<br /><br />\nA Fair Date<br />\nFollowing the deliberations on the date<br />\nof Spring Fair recently has been about<br />\nlike watching a tennis match. First the<br />\nFair was set for April 11-13, then it was<br />\nmoved to May 2-4, and now it is back<br />\non the original April date.<br />\nThe most interesting thing about the<br />\nwhole affair, however, is not the date<br />\nchange, which now seems unavoidable,<br />\nbut is Associate Dean of Students Chris<br />\nColombo's remarks that the Student<br />\nCouncil does not set the date of the Fair.<br />\nThe Fair is at least putatively a studentrun event, and almost everyone has tradi-<br /><br />\ntionally interpreted that to mean that the<br />\nCouncil sets the date. In fact, the administration has long maintained defacto control over the important aspects of<br />\nthe Fair, such as the music and beer<br />\npolicies, but never before has it been<br />\npublicly admitted\u2014at least to our<br />\nknowledge\u2014that the administration runs<br />\nthe Fair.<br />\nSo while the date of the Fair will no<br />\ndoubt be the issue receiving all the attention in the next few days, a more serious<br />\none\u2014who controls the event\u2014will probably slip away.<br /><br />\nAsked to explain why<br />\nmembers of the newly-formed<br />\nHopkins Coalition for a Free<br />\nSouth Africa participated in a<br />\ndemonstration against the<br />\nuniversity on Jan.10 (the day<br />\nBishop Desmond Tutu spoke at<br /><br />\npatrick<br />\nbond<br />\nTurner Auditorium), many<br />\nthoughts come to mind.<br />\nOf course, what must be<br />\nstressed initially is that our protest against the university's approximately $60 million in<br />\nSouth Africa-related investments also honored Bishop<br />\nTutu as well as the memory of<br />\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. No<br />\ndisrespect for King, Tutu, or<br />\nDr. Levi Watkins (who arranged the event) was intended;<br />\nnone was transmitted.<br />\nTo backtrack a bit, at the<br />\nfirst meeting of the Coalition<br />\nfor a Free South Africa, we<br />\nwere asked to join the alreadyscheduled demonstration of the<br />\nBaltimore Anti-Apartheid<br />\ncoalition.<br />\nSo we gathered at Turner<br />\nAuditorium in East Baltimore,<br />\nfifty of us from the university<br />\nand from the city of Baltimore,<br />\nprotesting the fact that while<br />\ncontinuing to realize huge profits from apartheid, Hopkins<br />\ncould bask in the sunlight<br />\nbrought by Bishop Tutu.<br />\nWe were protesting what we<br />\nfelt was a feeble attempt by<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller to avoid embarrassment<br />\nthe day before\u2014he announced<br />\nthat Hopkins would no longer<br />\ninvest in companies which<br />\nhaven't signed the Sullivan<br /><br />\nBishop<br />\nDESMOND M.

They claim that<br /><br />\nraised for experimentation, do<br />\nnot have the worth of a human<br />\nbeing. Human beings, unlike<br />\nanimals, have social positions<br />\nand obligations. Because of<br />\nthese relationships, which are<br />\nbuilt upon uniquely human<br />\nqualities, a human has far more<br />\nworth than a single animal.<br />\nThe charges that much<br />\nanimal experimentation is<br />\neither unnecessarily repetitive is<br />\nequally unfounded.

These<br />\nself-proclaimed liberators<br />\nhowever, ignore much of the<br />\nadvancements in medicine<br />\ndirectly due to animal experimentation. The list of advancements is long, from the<br />\ndiscovery of the regulatory role<br />\nof insulin in diabetics to the<br />\ndevelopment of new treatments<br />\nfor burn victims.<br />\nYet, the activists argue that<br />\nany advancements in medicine<br />\nonly delay the inevitable, and<br />\nthat furthermore, an animal's<br />\nlife is not necessarily less<br />\nvaluable than one of a human<br />\nbeing. Other animal rights activits claim that much of the experimentation done on animals<br />\nis either unnecessary due to<br />\nrepetition, or unnecessarily<br />\ncruel. Still others maintain that<br />\nanimal experimentation is some<br />\ngrand hoax of a sort, and that<br />\ninformation obtained from<br />\nanimal studies cannot have any<br />\nrelevance to human systems.<br />\nThe first point is, in my opinion, unreasonable. Animals,<br />\nparticularly those which are<br />\ndomesticated, or specifically<br /><br />\nof experiments is absolutely<br />\nnecessary to make sure that<br />\nreported findings are accurate,<br />\nand that proposed conlusions<br />\nare supported. In addition,<br />\nstrict guidelines are in place to<br />\nmake sure that animals are<br />\ntreated humanely.<br />\nFinally, the view that animal<br />\nexperimentation is inapplicable<br />\nto human systems is laughable.<br />\nHumans and all animals are<br />\nlinked from an evolutionary<br />\npoint of view, and as such share<br />\ncertain common features<br />\ndependent upon species. Thus<br />\nanimal systems serve as convenient analogous model systems<br />\nwhen experimentation on<br />\nhumans is inappropriate for<br />\ngathering research data epecially on a basic level.<br />\nHowever, I do agree with the<br />\npoint that animals should be<br />\ntreated as humanely as possible.<br />\nIn fact it is in the best interest<br />\nof any experiment that animals<br />\nare treated carefully as possible<br />\nso as to ensure proper results.<br />\nThis century seems to be riddled with groups whose novel<br />\ncauses are nothing more than<br />\nreconstitutions of archaic<br />\nsuperstitions and beliefs.<br />\nAnimal rights in particular<br />\nshould not be allowed to interfere with scientific work<br />\nwhich can yield important advances<br />\nin<br />\nlife-saving<br />\ntechnology.<br /><br />\nSouth Africa and a 'Whitewash'<br />\nContinued from Page 12<br /><br />\nvehicles; Caterpillar tractors are<br />\nused to destroy ancestral homes<br />\nduring forced removals; the list<br />\ngoes on.<br />\nAlthough the above companies provide goods and services which are essential in<br />\nmaintaining apartheid institutions, each of them has signed<br />\nthe Sullivan Principles and are<br />\nthus deemed by Hopkins<br />\nmorally acceptable to hold<br />\nstock in.<br />\nU.S. companies doing<br />\nbusiness in South Africa<br />\ntypically have earned about a<br />\n15 percent higher rate of return<br />\nform their operations in South<br />\nAfrica, where they have a captive Third World labor supply<br />\nand a First World consumers'<br />\nmarket, than from those in the<br />\nU.S. As a result, plant closings<br />\nin the northeastern and<br />\nmidwestern U.S. often have<br />\ndirectly corresponded with<br />\nplant openings in Port<br />\nElizabeth, Durban, and<br />\nelsewhere in South Africa. And<br />\nin return for taking advantage<br />\nof the inequal labor and consumer markets of apartheid,<br />\nthese companies, of which<br />\nHopkins owns stock in 45 out<br />\nof about 320, have made only<br />\nfleeting (and self-serving) at-<br /><br />\ntempts to reform the system.<br />\nHopkins has about $60<br />\nmillion invested in this evil<br />\nsystem. And that is why we<br />\ntook the opportunity of Bishop<br />\nTutu's visit to protest the<br />\nUniversity's moral hypocrisy.<br />\n(Many of us noted the<br />\nhypocrisy of Hopkin's official<br />\nnewspaper, the Gazette, which<br />\ndid its Jan. 14 cover story on<br />\nthe Tutu visit and printed the<br />\nUniversity's Sullivan Principles<br />\npolicy, without one mention of<br />\nour protest or Hopkins' $60<br />\nmillion stake in apartheid.)<br />\nIf we are serious about our<br />\nmotto\u2014\"The Truth Will<br />\nLiberate You!\"\u2014the Hopkins<br />\nstudents, faculty and staff, and<br />\nBaltimoreans actively opposed<br />\nto apartheid should demand the<br />\nUniversity acknowledge its<br />\nmoral inconsistency. By<br />\ndivesting from small companies<br />\nthat haven't signed the Sullivan<br />\nPrinciples, Muller and the<br />\nTrustees' Investments Committee merely expand their myth<br />\nthat U.S. companies in South<br />\nAfrica will work to end apartheid.<br />\nWe ask those trustees and administrators who find this difficult to believe (in some cases<br />\nbecause they themselves are executives in such companies), to<br />\nremember Cuba and Iran,<br /><br />\nwhere U.S. companies were nationalized following the overthrow of oppressive governments. If fiduciary responsibility is more important to some<br />\nHopkins officials than plain<br />\nand simple ethical considerations, the outcome should be<br />\nthe same:Divest Now!<br />\nFinally, if members of the<br />\nuniversity community heed the<br />\ncall to divest, coming from the<br />\nAfrican National Congress, the<br />\nUnited Democratic Front, the<br />\nCongress of South African<br />\nTrade Unions, the South<br />\nAfrican Council of Churches,<br />\nand 77 percent of the black<br />\npopulation, they will join our<br />\ngrowing movement\u2014the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Coalition<br />\nfor a Free South Africa.

When I did,<br />\nI was somewhat disappointed.<br />\nThe book contains many of the<br />\npopular segments of the show,<br />\nin pictorial form. A lot of it is<br />\nfunny, although most is much<br />\nfunnier on T.V.<br />\nThe book begins with an<br />\neditor's foreward by Merrill<br />\nMarkoe, head writer for Late<br />\nNight. Her piece on \"What the<br />\nDogs Have Taught Me\" is<br />\ngreat. The next section, \"Opening Remarks,\" is a collection of<br />\nLetterman's best one-liners<br />\nfrom the beginning of the<br />\nshow. I found many of them<br />\nvery funny, but that may be<br />\nbecause I pictured Letterman<br />\nsaying each as I read them.<br />\nThat wonderful sarcasm in Letterman's voice and his priceless<br />\nfacial expressions have a way of<br />\nmaking an unfunny joke funny.<br />\nI honestly don't know whether<br />\nI would have found these jokes<br />\nnearly as amusing had I not<br />\nbeen familiar with Letterman's<br />\nstyle.<br />\nSeveral of the other segments<br />\nfare better, since they have pic-<br /><br />\ntures to accompany the jokes.<br />\nThese include \"The Museum of<br />\nthe Hard to Believe,\" \"New<br />\nGift Ideas,\" \"Dave's Toy<br />\nShop,\" and \"New Medical<br />\nAids.\" Some of the more<br />\namusing visuals included the<br />\nLaLanne Q-Tip<br />\n\"Jack<br />\nDispenser,\" the \"Wiffle Ax,\"<br />\nand \"Lifelike Duplicates of Internal Organs.\" Many were<br />\nmade funnier with pictures of<br />\nLetterman demonstrating the<br />\nitems, although again, it's not<br />\nthe same as seeing it on T.V.<br />\nLetterman's<br />\nof<br />\nTwo<br />\n\"movies\" are included here.<br />\n\"They Took my Show Away<br />\n(an Afterschool Special),\" and<br />\n\"Dog Poetry\" work almost as<br />\nwell as they do on T.V., since<br />\nthe pictures and captions cover<br />\nthe humor pretty well. Still,<br />\nthey are lacking Letterman's<br />\nvoice in the narration, a factor<br />\nthat increases the humor level<br />\nconsiderably.<br />\nSeveral multiple-choice<br />\nsprinkled<br />\nare<br />\nquizzes<br />\ncovering<br />\nbook,<br />\nthe<br />\nt<br />\nthroughou<br />\nsubjects such as T.V., summer,<br />\nand going back to school. I<br />\nfound these very funny. Unlike<br />\nthe other segments, these actually seemed funnier in print.<br />\nAlso sprinkled in among the<br />\nother segments are pictorials on<br />\n\"etiquette\" in hotels, subways,<br />\nelevators, T.V. audiences, and<br />\nbeing a talk-show guest. The<br /><br />\npictures of Letterman, Paul<br />\nShaffer, and Larry \"Bud\"<br />\nMelman are hysterical.<br />\nHowever, the sections on talkshow and audience etiquette<br />\nprobably would be incomprehensible to someone not<br />\nfamiliar with Late Night.<br />\nI found the section entitled<br />\n\"Camping with Barry White\"<br />\nunfunny. Of course, since I'm<br />\nnot familiar with Mr. Barry<br />\nWhite, I probably wouldn't<br />\nhave thought it was funny on<br />\nthe show, either. Not<br />\neverything on the show is funny, but, again, they should have<br />\nincluded only the best segments<br />\nof Late Night in this book.<br />\nAn entire chunk of the book<br />\nis devoted to sections written by<br />\neach of the 15 writers. Ironically, I found this section the least<br />\nfunny of the entire book. Many<br />\nwere too long, and seemed to<br />\ncontain inside jokes. The book<br />\nwould not have suffered had<br />\nthey left out this section \"The Muppets All Die and Go for one don't know any such<br />\nto Hell,\" and \"A Child's First person, so I tried to be as obentirely.<br />\nBook of Smoking\" are par- jective as possible.

Puig is an experimental realist from Argentina whose latest work, Kiss of<br />\nthe Spider Woman, continues<br />\nthe tradition he set with his<br />\nearlier novel, The Buenos Aires<br />\nAffair. Both are banned in<br />\nArgentina because of their<br />\npolitical perspectives and Puig<br />\nhas wisely chosen to make his<br />\nhome in New York. Smart<br />\nman.<br />\nPuig's approach is different<br />\nto say the least, but once one<br />\nhas grown accustomed to his<br />\nunusual story-telling style, he<br />\noccupies the reader's senses and<br />\nis fully absorbing. He likes to<br />\nuse the debris of the<br />\nand<br />\nworld\u2014newspaper<br />\nmagazine clippings, police and<br />\nhospital reports, shopping<br />\nlists\u2014and lets them all tell their<br />\nown stories without his comments or intrusions.<br />\nKiss of the Spider Woman, is<br />\nactually a running dialogue between two men in a prison cell.<br />\nThe occupants are Molina and<br /><br />\n'Valentin. Molina is a middleaged apolitical homosexual<br />\nwho is in for eight years for<br />\n\"corruption of minors.\" His<br />\nunlikely cell mate is Valentin, a<br />\nyoung man who is not particularly sensitive and is highly<br />\ninvolved in the political<br />\nresistance movement. He is<br />\nheld for leading revolutionary<br />\nactivities and has been tortured<br />\nand is further abused as the<br />\nwork progresses.<br />\nThe two men are incredibly<br />\ndifferent and under other circumstances would not even<br />\nacknowledge one another's existence. Within the confines of<br />\na prison cell, with considerable<br />\ntime to pass, and with the everpresent threat of torture, these<br />\ntwo men who have nothing in<br />\ncommon and nothing to talk<br />\nabout, pass the time in a<br />\ncurious way. Molina is a storyteller and he passes the time by<br />\ndescribing movies he has seen.<br />\nThe movies he retells are real<br />\nfilms and they all touch the<br />\nnovel's themes of repression<br />\nand liberation, beauty and<br />\ngoodness, love, and fear. The<br />\nfascinating twist is that all too<br />\noften what occurs in the movies<br />\nMolina shares foreshadows a<br />\nsimilar and parallel development in what is happening to<br />\nMolina and Valentin (or will).<br />\nThe movies are entertaining<br /><br />\nPuig's approach<br />\nis different to say<br />\nthe least. . .<br />\nin themselves and the dialogue<br />\nin which they are told is so<br />\nnatural that the reader occasionally forgets that the story is<br />\nabout these two men and the<br />\nrelationship which develops<br />\nbetween them despite their obvious differences, lead astray<br />\ninto the real world.<br />\nA little later on we learn that<br />\nMolina has been solicited by the<br />\nwarden to act as a police plant<br />\nin order to extract information<br />\nfrom Valentin regarding the opposition movement. By aiding<br />\nthe police Molina is promised<br />\nan early pardon which would<br />\nhelp his ailing mother recover.<br />\nThe conflict is clear: Molina<br />\nfinds himself confronted with a<br />\ndecision that becomes more and<br />\nmore unbearable to make as he<br />\nand Valentin grow closer in<br />\nfriendship. At what point you<br />\nmight ask does a person place<br />\nhis welfare secondary to his<br />\ndevotion to another person?<br />\nPuig examines this question in<br />\ndepth in a fascinating, adventurous manner.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/25<br />\nThe<br />\nDental<br />\nReferral<br />\nService<br />\nwill find<br />\nthe dentist<br />\nthat's r[ght<br />\nfor .yoU!<br /><br />\nROTUNDA<br />\nWEDNESDAY NOON SERIES<br />\npresented by<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events<br /><br />\nThe<br />\nDental<br />\nReferral Service<br /><br />\n\"MOVIES: THE DAILY CRITIC'S PERSPECTIVE\"<br /><br />\n653-3445<br />\nM-F 8-4<br /><br />\nFEBRUARY, 5 NOON<br />\nGarrett Room, Milton S.

It's weird when people print their lyrics and they'll<br />\nsay the same things over and<br />\nover again, and you're reading<br />\nthe lyric sheet and it'll be 'Born<br />\nin the U.S.A., born in the<br />\nU.S.A., born in the U.S.A.'<br />\nOkay,I knew you were saying<br />\nthat anyway, now give me a little more!\"<br />\nLombardo, finished with his<br />\nguitar, puts it down on another<br />\n-couch. Merchant puts aside her<br />\nWalkman, picks it up, and<br />\nstarts to strum some chords.<br />\n\"The Wishing Chair\" was<br />\nproduced by Joe Boyd, who<br />\nworked with Fairport Convention in the 60s, when legendary<br />\nguitarist Richard Thompson<br />\nwas still in the band. So was the<br />\nlate Sandy Denny, a vocalist<br />\nwhom Merchant's singing<br />\nsometimes brings to mind. Fairport specialized in redoing<br /><br />\ntraditional folk songs; often, it<br />\nwas hard to determine which of<br />\nthe music was original and<br />\nwhich was traditional. Some of<br />\nthe Maniacs' songs have that<br />\ntimeless quality as well, making<br />\nBoyd an apt choice.<br />\n\"He liked us from early on,\"<br />\nsays Lombardo. \"He has his<br />\nown record label, Hannibal<br />\nRecords, and his office in<br />\nManhattan is on the same floor<br />\nas our booking agent's. Our<br />\nagent played our tape for Joe<br />\nBoyd, saying 'it's like the punk<br />\nFairport' and all this. He expressed an interest in working<br />\nwith us.\"<br />\nThat was fine with the<br />\nManiacs, but their record label,<br />\nsays Lombardo, \"[was] going<br />\n'no, no way.' They didn't think<br />\nhe was commercially viable. He<br />\ndidn't make hit records. But we<br />\ndidn't want one of these 80s<br />\nproducers with a big drum<br />\nsound. We didn't want our<br />\nrecord to sound like Tears For<br />\nFears.\"<br /><br />\nThe band won out, and<br />\nshortly after Boyd was contracted to do \"The Wishing<br />\nChair,\" R.E.M. signed him up<br />\nto produce their third album,<br />\n\"Fables of the Reconstruction.\"<br />\n\"They called us and wanted<br />\nto make sure it was all right<br />\nwith us,\" says Lombardo of<br />\nR.E.M. \"So many of the articles written about.us mention<br />\nR.E.M.., and I think they realized<br />\nthat if they used this producer, they knew their record<br />\nwould come out first, and it<br />\nwould look like we were using<br />\nR.E.M.'s producer.\"<br />\n\"In a way, a lot of articles<br />\nhave said that. But it doesn't<br />\nmatter, you know, it only seems<br />\nnatural that bands who have<br />\nsimilar ideas about music,<br />\nsimilar ideas about how to<br />\nwork and how to achieve what<br />\nthey're trying to do, would<br />\ngravitate towards the same kind<br />\nof people.\"<br />\n\"The Wishing Chair\" was<br />\nmade without aspirations of<br /><br />\nTop 40 stardom, but Lombardo adds that \"I think many of<br />\nour songs, like 'Can't Ignore<br />\nThe Train' or 'Tension Makes<br />\nA Tangle,' are pretty<br />\nuniversal\u2014I don't think they're<br />\nthreatening to anybody.

CRAMER<br /><br />\nThe Academic Council has recommended to<br />\nPresident Gordon that Hopkins admit women<br />\nundergraduates for the Fall term of next year.<br />\nThe Council's recommendations, passed in<br />\nits Wednesday meeting, call for Gordon to<br />\nappoint a \"task force committee\" to report<br />\nto the Academic Council with full details on<br />\nthe ,institution of general undergraduate coeducation.<br />\nUntil this task force completes its work ,it<br />\nwill not be known how many women will be<br />\nadmitted and in which classes, or if the total<br />\nsize of the undergraduate beidy will be changed.<br />\n\"Some Women\"<br />\nThe Council, however, did specify that<br />\nI wanted \"some women\" to be admitted for<br />\nenrollment next year. The statement released<br />\nby Dean Kimball's office yesterday said that<br />\nit was the Council's intent that Hopkins \"proceed as rapidly as feasible to a significant proportion of females in the undergraduate body.\"<br />\nCouncil members were generally unwilling to<br />\ntalk about the decision yesterday. The members<br />\nof the task force have not been named by<br />\nthe President. The recommendations of the<br />\nAcademic Council must be approved by Gordon<br />\nend the Board of Trustees before they may be<br />\nected upon. Although Gordon was unavailable<br />\nfor comment yesterday, it is assumed that he<br />\nwill react favorably to the recommendations.<br />\nThe next meeting of the Board of Trustees will<br />\ntake place on November 10.<br />\nThe task force will consist of two members<br />\nof the faculty, two undergraduates, one rep-<br /><br />\nthe Freshmen class more than any other.<br />\nAccording to Homewood House sources,President Gordon views the task force as responsible<br />\nfor reporting on every aspect of the changes<br />\nrequired for coeducation. This indicates that<br />\nthe committee will look into everything from<br />\nalterations in the curriculum to placing<br />\n\"men\" and \"women\" signs on the doors of<br />\nlavatories.<br />\nAdministrators have been looking into the<br />\nproblems and possibilities of undergraduate coeducation for some time. Recently, the<br />\nAcademic Council affirmed undergraduate coeducation \"in principle.\"<br /><br />\nresentative from Dean Kimball's office, and one<br />\nrepresentative from the Office of Robert F.<br />\nKerley, the Vice-President for Administration.<br />\n\"Soon,\"Very Soon<br /><br />\nDirector of Admissions William Brinkley said that<br />\nthat he would meet. the committee's recommendations \"soon\" in order to do an effective job of recruiting for the Fall term. \"I'm<br />\nnot ready to move until I get the answers,\"<br />\nhe said. Another administrative source said<br />\nthat the report of the task force would probably<br />\nhave to be submitted by November 15 for<br />\ncoeducation to be successfully implemented<br />\nnext year.<br />\nBrinkley was enthusiastic about the possibilities which coeducation would provide for<br />\nHopkins. He said he wanted to see it become<br />\npart of \"our total program.\" He also stated<br />\nthat it might benefit the recruiting efforts of<br />\nthe ,University by making Hopkins more attractive to men. Ronald Owens, Assistant Director<br />\nof Admissions, said that the coeducation move<br />\nwould indicate a general improvement in the<br />\nsocial conditions at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nNo Merger<br />\nThere had been discussion of the feasibility<br />\nof merging with Goucher College instead of<br />\nadmitting women to Hopkins. It was felt by<br />\nsome that because Goucher already had all of<br />\nthe facilities which women require, Hopkins<br />\nwould be wiser to attempt the merger.<br />\nThe faculty at Hopkins, however, was largely<br />\nagainst the move. There was a fear that faculty<br />\nmembers here would lose the control which<br />\nthey exercise over curriculum and program requirements if the university merged with<br />\nGoucher. Many faculty members were upset<br />\nover the types of courses offered in the<br />\nGoucher-Hopkins cooperative program.<br />\nIn addition, problems of transportation between the two campuses would have proved<br />\ndifficult to eliminate. Had Hopkins amid Goucher<br />\nmerged, the university would- have accrued no<br />\nfinancial advantages. Goucher's endowment is<br />\nsmall compared to that of Hopkins.<br /><br />\nAlready Interviewing<br />\nBrinkley stated that the University was already receiving letters from women. His staff<br />\nhas already been talking to female high school<br />\nseniors. However, he stated, that he also wished<br />\nto enroll transfer students. \"I think we could<br />\nget some fine young ladies through transfer,\"<br />\nhe said. No one was willing to speculate on<br />\nhow many women would be enrolled in each<br />\nclass. Presumably, the women will enroll in<br /><br />\nSteven Muller<br /><br />\nVol. LXXIV<br /><br />\nHOME WOOD BALTIMORE<br /><br />\nOCTOBER 31, 1969<br /><br />\n74th YEAR<br /><br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nDr. Steven Muller was unanimously<br />\nelected the tenth president of the<br />\nUniversity yesterday afternoon at a<br />\nspecial meeting of the Board of Trustees.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\nNEWS4ETTER<br />\nlaitinuire, Mar\\ Lind<br /><br />\nVol. IX XVI, EXTRA<br /><br />\nSchnydman To Head IFC<br />\nJerry Schnydman was elected<br />\npresident of ttie Inter-Fraternity<br />\n0ouncil Tuesday, succeeding<br />\nLarry Schmidt.<br />\nBryan Glynn was elected vicepresident, Joe Parker treasurer,<br />\nand Oggie Hamilton secretary.<br />\nOchnydman won after three ballots on three presidential candidates, Boyce Hendricks, Paul<br />\npellet and Tony Romeo.<br />\nPresident BotinYdman had no<br />\noonnnent au the Phi Psi affair,<br />\nSaying,'Ile situation is ciosed;<br />\nOhlise end of the year the thing<br />\nWill be over.\"' He said he wanted<br />\nthe I.P.C. to become a prestigious organisotion indeed of a<br />\nSentry/venial one.<br />\nfiebnytimara<br />\nSrlsoydman favors change in<br />\n\"tertian saps* of rudi,\" including lees in-dorin rushing and a<br />\nshorter rut&amp; period, but does not<br /><br />\nwant to change the number of<br />\nparties.

In<br />\nearly December, Albee picked<br />\na number of potential actors<br />\nand directors out of the ranks<br />\nof auditioning undergrads and<br />\nsix student plays out of a pool<br />\nof submissions. Intersession<br />\nmeant a rigorous course of<br />\nwork with Albee for these<br />\naspiring playwrights, actors,<br />\nand directors. Finally, the fruit<br />\nof their labor comes to the<br />\nstage\u2014this weekend: Friday,<br />\nSaturday, and Sunday at 8 p.m.<br />\nin the L/V room.<br />\nThe past two Albee productions have been enjoyable affairs featuring good acting and<br />\nalways interesting, occasionally brilliant, writing. The coordinator of this program,<br />\nWriting Seminars professor<br />\nRobert Arellano, hints that this<br />\nweekend's shows may be the<br />\nbest yet. The past two years<br />\nhave helped smooth out the<br />\nworkings of the system and<br />\nAlbee's level of supervision has<br />\nbeen the most productive thus<br />\nfar.<br />\nTwo of the chosen plays<br />\ncome from Arellano's Introductory Playwrighting class,<br /><br />\ntwo come from his Advanced<br />\nclass, and one comes from his<br />\nIntermediate class. One play,<br />\nJohn Lasseigne's Three Voices<br />\nwas submitted independently.<br />\nLasseigne's play is directed<br />\nby John Park. About a murder,<br />\nits cast of characters include the<br />\nmurderer, the victim, and the<br />\nvictim's son; the play, however,<br />\ntakes place eight years after the<br />\nmurder\u2014figure that out. Sandrine Tiller's Like a Fish in the<br />\nWater is directed by Jack<br />\nTomalis and is about, simply,<br />\na man, a woman, and some<br />\nfish. Herman Ayayo directed<br />\ngrad student James Boylan's<br />\nplay, All Soul's Day, which is<br />\nabout two people that meet in<br />\na church on All Soul's Day.<br />\nThe remaining three plays are<br />\nNo Stopping Any Time, by<br />\nDuncan Smith, directed by<br />\nAnne-Marie Ulrich, and about<br />\ntwo schoolmates who meet<br />\nafter ten years; A Process ofInspiration, by Herman Ayayo,<br />\ndirected by Robbie Simon, and<br />\nabout a novelist who runs dry<br />\nand his search for inspiration;<br />\nand Jay/Alfred by David<br />\nCharles, directed by Rob Grey,<br />\nand about two guys and their<br />\nattitude(s) toward the opposite<br />\nsex.<br />\nThis weekend's production is<br />\nsponsored by the Writing<br />\nSeminars department.

A<br />\nmohawk or torn T-shirt would<br />\nseem more appropriate. Who<br />\nwould expect a group named<br />\n10,000 Maniacs to specialize in<br />\nlilting folk melodies and guitar<br />\nbased pop music that nobody<br />\nwould ever dream of slamdancing to?<br />\nOne of the Maniacs' two<br />\nguitarists, John Lombardo,<br />\npromises that the sound check<br />\nwon't be too loud. \"You've<br />\nheard our wimpy album,\" he<br />\nsays, plopping down on a couch<br />\nwith his guitar and his Six<br />\nMillion Dollar Man lunchbox<br />\nfull of strings and various tools.<br />\nHe is the scruffier half of the<br />\nManiacs' guitar section\u2014<br />\nRobert Buck, who also plays<br />\nthe mandolin, is the only one in<br />\nthe band who you'd really expect to be a musician, and<br />\nthat's mostly because one of his<br />\nears is double-pierced.

The<br />\nprize, won through a competition, is named after the late<br />\ncello virtuoso Gregor Piatigorsky and is awarded to the cellist<br />\nwho excels simultaneously as a<br />\nsoloist, as a chamber musician,<br />\nand as a teacher.<br />\nFinkel began his training<br />\nwith his father at an early age<br />\nand has studied under teachers<br />\nas distinguished as Msistlav<br />\nRostropovich, present conductor of the National Symphony.<br />\nHe is currently a member of the<br />\nEverson Quartet and is an Artist in Residence of the<br />\nChamber Music Society of the<br />\nLincoln Center.<br />\nPianist Wu Han performed<br />\nwith Finkel. Han, a graduate of<br />\nthe Hartt School of Music, is a<br />\nskilled accompanist and has<br />\nmade numerous appearances<br />\nwith the Emerson String<br />\nQuartet.<br />\nSunday's program began<br />\nwith three classical works: one<br />\neach of Beethoven, Schumann,<br />\nand Brahms. Standing out<br />\namong these was the \"Sonata<br />\nin Minor for cello and piano,<br />\nOp. 83\" of Johannes Brahms.<br />\nFinkel brought out the<br />\nsublime side of the cello with<br /><br />\nhis reading of the piece. His<br />\nplaying of the deep, rich<br />\nmelody of the first section<br />\ndisplayed that its theme,<br />\nalthough written almost entirely<br />\nin the lower range of the instrument, can be quite lyrical and<br />\noccasionally even romantic.<br />\nFinkel's faultless playing of the<br />\nmany double-stops in the midst<br />\nof this section, as well as his<br />\ncrisp execution of the pizzacato<br />\npassages, added vivid color to<br />\nthe piece. In the second section<br />\nof the piece, Finkel starkly contrasted the light and graceful<br />\nfigures against heavier romantic themes displaying his<br />\nmultifaceted ability. The intense fugue which began the<br />\nthird section allowed Finkel to<br />\ndemonstrate his dexterity, requiring the use of the entire<br />\nfingerboard of the instrument<br />\nto create polyphonic melodies<br />\nfrom a single instrument.<br />\nThe second half of the program contained more recent<br />\nworks including Benjamin Britten's \"Sonata in C for Cello<br />\nand Piano.\" The style of this<br />\npiece was in complete contrast<br />\nto the previous works.<br />\nBritten's work begins fairly<br />\nsimply with a motive, or first<br />\ntheme, consisting of two scale<br />\nsteps. Though elementary,<br />\nthese serve as the subject of<br />\nmany variations throughout all<br />\nfour movements of the piece.<br />\nTo add further interest to the<br />\ntheme, Britten employs many<br />\nof the embellishments available<br />\nto stringed instruments such as<br />\npizzacato (plucked) playing,<br /><br />\nharmonics, and glissando<br />\n(sliding) fingering.<br />\nAs encore pieces Finkel performed Rachmaninoff's splendid and lyrical \"Prelude\"<br />\nfollowed by Rostropovich's<br />\n\"Humeresque,\" an extremely<br />\ncomplicated piece of deceptive<br />\nlevity. Both were performed<br />\nflawlessly and with utmost attention to the virtues of each.<br />\nThroughout the performance,<br />\nFinkel displayed his versatility<br />\nas an artist and a musician. At<br />\nhome in most genre, Finkel<br />\nis master of not only the printed<br />\nmusic but also of the spirit<br />\nwithin it.<br />\nThe next concert in the<br />\nShriver Series, on February 15,<br />\nfeatures The Beaux Arts Trio.<br />\nMOVIES: (Note.

When I did,<br />\nI was somewhat disappointed.<br />\nThe book contains many of the<br />\npopular segments of the show,<br />\nin pictorial form. A lot of it is<br />\nfunny, although most is much<br />\nfunnier on T.V.<br />\n. The book begins with an<br />\neditor's foreward by Merrill<br />\nMarkoe, head writer for Late<br />\nNight. Her piece on \"What the<br />\nDogs Have Taught Me\" is<br />\ngreat. The next section, \"Opening Remarks,\" is a collection of<br />\nLetterman's best one-liners<br />\nfrom the beginning of the<br />\nshow. I found many of them<br />\nvery funny, but that may be<br />\nbecause I pictured Letterman<br />\nsaying each as I read them.<br />\nThat wonderful sarcasm in Letterman's voice and his priceless<br />\nfacial expressions have a way of<br />\nmaking an unfunny joke funny.<br />\nI honestly don't know whether<br />\nI would have found these jokes<br />\nnearly as amusing had I not<br />\nbeen familiar with Letterman's<br />\nstyle.<br />\nSeveral of the other segments<br />\nfare better, since they have pic-<br /><br />\ntures to accompany the jokes.<br />\nThese include \"The Museum of<br />\nthe Hard to Believe,\" \"New<br />\nGift Ideas,\" \"Dave's Toy<br />\nShop,\" and \"New Medical<br />\nAids.\" Some of the more<br />\namusing visuals included the<br />\nQ-Tip<br />\nLaLanne<br />\n\"Jack<br />\nDispenser,\" the \"Willie Ax,\"<br />\nand \"Lifelike Duplicates of Internal Organs.\" Many were<br />\nmade funnier with pictures of<br />\nLetterman demonstrating the<br />\nitems, although again, it's not<br />\nthe same as seeing it on T.V.<br />\nLetterman's<br />\nof<br />\nTwo<br />\n\"movies\" are included here.<br />\n\"They Took my Show Away<br />\n(an Afterschool Special),\" and<br />\n\"Dog Poetry\" work almost as<br />\nwell as they do on T.V., since<br />\nthe pictures and captions cover<br />\nthe humor pretty well. Still,<br />\nthey are lacking Letterman's<br />\nvoice in the narration, a factor<br />\nthat increases the humor level<br />\nconsiderably.<br />\nSeveral multiple-choice<br />\nsprinkled<br />\nare<br />\nquizzes<br />\nthroughout the book, covering<br />\nsubjects such as T.V., summer,<br />\nand going back to school. I<br />\nfound these very funny. Unlike<br />\nthe other segments, these actually seemed funnier in print.<br />\nAlso sprinkled in among the<br />\nother segments are pictorials on<br />\n\"etiquette\" in hotels, subways,<br />\nelevators, T.V. audiences, and<br />\nbeing a talk-show guest. The<br /><br />\npictures of Letterman, Paul<br />\nShaffer, and Larry \"Bud\"<br />\nMelman are hysterical.<br />\nHowever, the sections on talkshow and audience etiquette<br />\nprobably would be incomprehensible to someone not<br />\nfamiliar with Late Night.<br />\nI found the section entitled<br />\n\"Camping with Barry White\"<br />\nunfunny. Of course, since I'm<br />\nnot familiar with Mr. Barry<br />\nWhite, I probably wouldn't<br />\nhave thought it was funny on<br />\nthe show, either. Not<br />\neverything on the show is funny, but, again, they should have<br />\nincluded only the best segments<br />\nof Late Night in this book.<br />\nAn entire chunk of the book<br />\nis devoted to sections written by<br />\neach of the 15 writers. Ironically, I found this section the least<br />\nfunny of the entire book. Many<br />\nwere too long, and seemed to<br />\ncontain inside jokes. The book<br />\nwould not have suffered had<br />\nthey left out this section \"The Muppets All Die and Go<br />\nto Hell,\" and \"A Child's First<br />\nentirely.<br />\nA comic section entitled Book of Smoking\" are par\"How to Be a Responsible T.V. ticularly amusing. Actual letters<br />\nViewer\" was one of the funniest are pictured in the Viewer Mail<br />\nin the book. \"Dave's 1\"-,, section, with all of Letterman's<br />\nusual silliness following each.<br />\nFunhouse\" and \"Frani,<br />\nIn general, Late Night with<br />\nFred\" also translate well in<br />\nDavid Letterman doesn't fare<br />\nprinted form.<br />\nTwo all-time favorites,\"The well in print. Of course, the onLate Night Bookmobile,\" and ly truly objective review of this<br />\n\"Viewer Mail\" are also includ- book would be by someone<br />\ned. Some of the books, such as who has never seen the show. I<br /><br />\nfor one don't know any such<br />\nperson, so I tried to be as objective as possible. I think that<br />\nif this book were made into one<br />\nof Letterman's T.V.'specials, it<br />\nwould be his best ever. Even<br />\nthough Late Night with David<br />\nLetterman: The Book isn't as<br />\nfunny as the show itself, I<br />\nrecommend it for all die-hard<br />\nLetterman fans.<br /><br />\nManuel Puig: Continuing a Nifty Tradition<br />\nKiss of the Spider Woman.<br />\nby Manuel Puig<br />\nRandom House, $3.95.<br /><br />\nKISS Of THE<br />\nSPIDED WOMAN<br /><br />\nby Gil Israeli<br />\nA good many novelists lament the day they let their work<br />\nslip into the hands of a reputed<br />\nfilm maker, but Manuel Puig is<br />\nnot one of them. Puig is an experimental realist from Argentina whose latest work, Kiss of<br />\nthe Spider Woman, continues<br />\nthe tradition he set with his<br />\nearlier novel, The Buenos Aires<br />\nAffair. Both are banned in<br />\nArgentina because of their<br />\npolitical perspectives and Puig<br />\nhas wisely chosen to make his<br />\nhome in New York. Smart<br />\nman.<br />\nPuig's approach is different<br />\nto say the least, but once one<br />\nhas grown accustomed to his<br />\nunusual story-telling style, he<br />\noccupies the reader's senses and<br />\nis fully absorbing. He likes to<br />\nuse the debris of the<br />\nand<br />\nworld\u2014newspaper<br />\nmagazine clippings, police and<br />\nhospital reports, shopping<br />\nlists\u2014and lets them all tell their<br />\nown stories without his comments or intrusions.<br />\nKiss of the Spider Woman, is<br />\nactually a running dialogue between two men in a prison cell.<br />\nThe occupants are Molina and<br /><br />\n'Valentin.

So I couldn't resist going to see the place on a recent<br />\nafternoon in Washington. The<br />\nMuseum is located on the<br />\ngrounds of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in the<br />\nDistrict of Columbia. I had<br />\ndecided that the stories must<br />\nsurely be exaggerations; the<br />\nidea of a museum displaying a<br />\nthree-headed baby soaking in a<br />\njar of formaldehyde was too<br />\nbizarre. I was surprised to find<br />\nthat though some of the stories<br />\nmay have been factually inaccurate, they were hardly exaggerations. Many of the exhibits<br />\nwere extremely repulsive.<br />\nThe Museum was begun at<br />\nthe time of the Civil War for<br />\nthe study of military medicine<br />\nand surgery. Today, injuries<br />\nobtained in battle are still a major part of the collection. But<br />\nthe Museum also contains<br />\nspecimens representing practically all diseases that affect<br />\nman, as well as extensive collec-<br /><br />\ntions of medical, surgical, and nal organs which are equally<br />\ndiagnostic instruments and diseased but are completely unrelated medical items.<br />\nfamiliar to most people.<br />\nThe largest part of the Perhaps a few sick minds would<br />\ndisplayed collection is in the derive cheap thrills from these<br />\npathology room.

It is definitely worth<br />\nthe time during an excursion to<br />\nthe capital. Those who visit the,<br />\nMuseum in the same spirit that<br />\nthey go to see a blood-andgore-filled movie will be disappointed. Though large pieces of<br />\nhuman anatomy are sliced and<br />\ndiced in many different ways,<br />\nthis is not a freak show. As with<br />\nmost museums, one can<br />\nbecome jaded after a short<br />\ntime.

These unfortunate rises were paralleled<br />\nwith the increased military<br />\nspending.<br />\nSidel cited statistics showing<br />\nthat while there were more<br />\nresearch and development (R<br />\nand D)funds, military R and D<br />\nincreased 65 percent while all<br />\nother R and D's suffered a 30<br />\npercent decrease. He implied<br />\nthat this discrepancy was due to<br />\na disproportionate amount of<br />\nthe military R and D funds<br />\ndirected toward designing objects with \"ridiculous specifications which would never be<br />\nneeded.\" Sidel also stated that<br />\nthe Soviet Union was undergoing a similar detrimental social<br />\ntrend due to its own<br />\nmilitarization.<br />\nSidel conceded that jobs were<br />\ncreated by high military spen-<br /><br />\nding. However, if the money<br />\nwas channeled into human service programs, jobs would be<br />\nproduced as well, he said. He<br />\nremarked that the difference in<br />\nthe number of jobs would be<br />\ninsignificant. This high level of<br />\nmilitary spending was juxtaposed with figures showing that<br />\nthe stable level of unemployment rose from 4 percent in the<br />\n1950's to 7 percent in the<br />\n1980's.<br />\nDuring his speech, Sidel introduced a metronome and set<br />\nit beating.

And<br />\nwith every two beats, a child<br />\ndied or became disabled from<br />\nlack of immunization or safe<br />\nwater supply.

This<br />\nnew concept could possibly<br />\nrevolutionize the basketball<br />\nplay in the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center. Sources inside<br />\nthe Athletic Center have confirmed that no particular individual has been credited as<br />\nthe originator of this new<br />\ntheory, but rather it was a team<br />\nrealization. This new concept<br />\nhas been Defense. That's<br />\ncapital D...and everything else<br />\nin the lower case. Okay so Dr.<br />\nNaismith does not have to be<br />\nnotified about this one; and<br /><br />\ncoaches from across the nation<br />\nare not going to visit Hopkins<br />\nto see this marvel, but the wins<br />\nare beginning to come for the<br />\nBlue Jays and defense has been<br />\nthe cause.<br />\n\"We played as tough a<br />\ndefense against Franklin and<br />\nMarshall as I have seen since<br />\nI've been here,\" says coach<br />\nNap Doherty. The Jays won<br />\nthat one 67-66 with an unlikely<br />\nhero. Terry Ryan put the Jays<br />\nahead with a bucket with eight<br />\nseconds remaining. Jedan<br />\nPhillips, who had 14 points on<br />\nthe night, added a free throw<br />\nwith three seconds left to ice the<br />\ngame. Why Ryan instead of<br />\nDave Wilson who usually is the<br /><br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\nRalph Horne looks to jam in the Ursinus game.<br /><br />\nchoice to win it or lose it?<br />\n\"We were in a spread and<br />\nTerry took it in and beat his<br />\nman,\" said Doherty.<br />\nTwo days later, Swarthmore<br />\nwas in town to challenge<br />\nHopkins and once again the<br />\nJays pulled out a victory in the<br />\nfinal seconds. This time,<br />\nWilson seized the opportunity<br />\nand hit a 20 foot jumper with<br />\nnine seconds left for the win.<br />\nBack to back victories within<br />\nthe conference have left the<br />\nJays with a realistic shot in the<br />\nMAC race. The big news over<br />\nthe holidays is that Widener<br />\nwho usually stomps everyone in<br />\nthe MAC has lost two games<br />\nwith only three victories to<br />\nshow.<br />\nIt has been a long time since<br />\nWidener was 3-2 and thus the<br />\nMAC race should be a good<br />\none. Washington College is<br />\natop the league at 6-0. Ursinus<br />\nwho comes to Homewood this<br />\nweek for a big game is 4-1.<br />\nWidener is behind Ursinus and<br />\nHopkins is 2-2. Sure the Jays<br />\nhave a long way to go but at<br />\nleast they control their own<br />\ndestiny. If Hopkins pulls off<br />\nthe upset of Ursinus the Jays<br />\nare very much within reach.<br />\nThe momentum is certainly in<br />\nHopkins' corner with the two<br />\nconsecutive last second victories.<br />\nLearning from those two victories is of the most importance<br />\nfor the Jays. Doherty's squad<br />\nwas forced to play without<br />\nRalph Horne who twisted an<br />\nankle in a contest with Messiah<br />\nCollege. Horne had been<br />\naveraging 14 points a game, second to Wilson with a 16 point<br />\naverage. Without Horne, the<br />\nJays featured a more balanced<br />\nscoring attack along with the<br />\nstepped-up defense.

Shaplen<br />\nThe men's fencing team is on<br />\na roll. After a disastrous opening down south in which they<br />\ndropped three of their first four<br />\ndecisons, they have switched into high gear to win their last<br />\nthirteen meets\u2014all on the road!<br />\nThose thirteen wins brings their<br />\nrecord to 14-3 (3-0 in the MAC<br />\nConference). Coach Dick Oles<br />\nfeels, \"the team should win all<br />\nits remaining matches if the top<br />\nnine fence up to par.\"<br />\nThe team, which remained at<br />\nHopkins over intersession,<br />\nrecently returned from two long<br />\nroadtrips. One was a nine-day<br />\ntrip on which they amassed a<br />\n10-0 record, and the other a two<br />\nday trip where they notched<br />\nanother three wins. The fencers<br />\nhave also recently completed<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\none of the two national tournaments they will participate in<br />\nthis year. (The United States<br />\nFencing Associaton and the<br />\nNCAA hold separate championships). The USFA tourney,<br />\nheld in North Carolina, proved<br />\ndisappointing for the team as<br />\nthey finished tied for 7th with<br />\nOhio State. Although Coach<br />\nOles feels the team could have<br />\ndone better, he says, \"It can<br />\nstill fulfill its goal by winning<br />\nthe MAC tournament in<br />\nMarch\"\u2014a feat which, if accomplished, would bring the<br />\nchampionship trophy home for<br />\nthe third straight year.<br />\nThe Fensters, Coach Oles<br />\nsaid,\"are doing well. They're<br />\npoised, well balanced, and experienced. Basically they're doing as I expected.\" By using the<br />\nword \"experienced,\" Oles was<br /><br />\nindirectly referring to the fact<br />\nthat seven out of the top nine<br />\nfencers are seniors. To help<br />\nallieviate the problem that this<br />\nmight cause next year, Oles said<br />\nhe is \"giving the substitutes<br />\nplenty of playing time.\" The<br />\nteam readily subs after it<br />\nregisters the necessary fourteen<br />\nbouts needed to win a match.<br />\n\"This may cause the scores to<br />\nbe closer than they should or<br />\nwould normally be,\" said Oles,<br />\n\"but the rewards will surface<br />\nnext year when the subs move<br />\ninto starting positions.\"<br />\nWith only two home dates<br />\nthis year, the team doesn't get<br />\nto fence in front of a home<br />\ncrowd very often, and says they<br />\nwould appreciate as much support as possible when it opens<br />\nat home on Feb. 8 and tries to<br />\nkeep its winning streak alive.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/29<br /><br />\nRecords Sail As Jays Splash On<br />\nby Steve Applebaum<br />\nThe men's swim team raised<br />\nits record to 8-2 with a victory<br />\nover Swarthmore, and a strong<br />\nshowing in a quad meet against<br />\nHamilton, St. Lawrence, and<br />\nUniversity of Rochester.

The Jay's victory over<br />\nGettysburg is their first in five<br />\nyears against the Bullets.<br />\nFirst, however, the Jays<br />\ndowned Eastern College by a<br />\ndecisive 45-10 score. Senior tricaptain Neil Porter began with<br />\na pin in 1:04 to put Hopkins up<br />\n6-0. Forfeits to tri-captain Jules<br />\nShin at 126 and Alan Ronson at<br />\n134 ran the score to 18-0, and<br />\nafter Eastern scored a win at<br />\n142, Houman Tavaf's pin at<br />\n150 in 1:50 gave the Blue Jays<br />\na 24-4 lead.<br />\nAn Eastern pin at 158 pulled<br />\nthem to 24-10, but the rest of<br />\nthe match belonged to Hopkins.

Brian Bolinger,<br />\ncoming off their tri-meet wins over Gettysburg and Eastern on Wednes- a tri-captain at 190, made it<br />\nday.

Offensively, Coach<br />\nDressler is looking for<br />\nStephanie Spengler to develop.<br />\nDressler desperately needs an<br />\ninside scoring threat.<br />\nThe Swarthmore Quakers<br />\nunmercifully trounced the Blue<br />\nJays in their last home game.<br />\nGood passing shredded the<br />\nHopkins defense enabling<br /><br />\nSwarthmore to take a 34-point<br />\nlead. Hopkins was plagued by<br />\nnumerous turnovers and bad<br />\nshot selection. The final score<br />\nwas 79-55.<br />\nDespite their weaknesses,<br />\nDressler sees much potential in<br />\nher young spirited squad. Cindy Harper is averaging 20.5<br />\npoints a game leading Hopkins'<br />\nscorers. Harper broke the single<br />\ngame scoring mark for Hopkins<br />\nwith her 39 points against the<br />\nfierce Notre Dame squad.<br />\nHopkins lost the bittersweet<br />\ncontest by 4 points. \"Harper<br />\nputs on an incredible offensive<br />\ndisplay at each game. Her fast<br />\nbreaks and creative moves to<br />\nthe hoop distinguish herself.\"<br />\nJeannie Clark strung 2 solid<br />\ngames together to score 34<br />\npoints.

Shin, wrestling up a<br />\nweight class at 134, wrestled a<br />\nfine match in scoring a 11-2 major decision to make the score<br />\n16-0.

Two more<br />\nextremely close wins for Gettysburg at 190 and Hwt. closed<br />\nout the match, and Hopkins<br />\nwas a 26-15 victor.<br />\nThe Blue Jay wrestlers have<br />\nwon 9 of their 12 January matches, and are bidding to top last<br />\nseason's record of 13 wins for<br />\nthe season. Coach Andy Janquitto offered several reasons<br />\nfor the team's recent success.<br />\nThe return of fifth-year senior<br />\nNolan, Barnum's transition<br />\nfrom 177 to 167, and the fine<br />\nwrestling from captains Porter,<br />\nShin, and Bolinger have been<br />\nmajor reasons. Moreover, outstanding performances and<br />\ndepth at all weight classes make<br /><br />\nler has played excellent defense,<br />\nshowing her ability to get back<br />\non defense. She swatted away<br />\n5 shots against Dominican and<br />\nhad 3 blocks in the first half<br />\nagainst Dickinson. Dressler<br />\nfeels she must still mature offensively despite some good<br />\nefforts.<br />\nRachelle LaForce had a<br />\ntypical outstanding game offensively against Swarthmore scoring 17 points. Dressler has great<br />\nconfidence in LaForce's outside<br />\nshot. Hec main weakness is her<br />\ninability to get back on defense<br />\nconsistently. Her rebounding<br />\nprowess is greatly needed.<br />\n\"Martina Waluk has been an<br />\noffensive threat coming off the<br />\nbench.
