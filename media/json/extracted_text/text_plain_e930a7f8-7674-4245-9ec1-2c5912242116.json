It is doubtful if a better concert has ever been given in the entire history of the clubs.<br />\nEspecial credit should be given to<br />\nthe Board of Managers for their<br />\nwork in arranging the concert. The<br />\nlarge crowd was ample evidence of<br />\nthe efficient advertising which had<br />\nbeen done, and the arrangements<br />\nthroughout gave proof of careful<br />\nand thorough organization.<br />\nThe program of the concert was<br />\nas follows:<br />\n<br />\nThe trustees of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity appeared last Thursday<br />\nbefore the joint meeting of the corn:mittee of the Maryland Legislature making up the Appropriation<br />\nBill, and a plea was made by President Goodnow and B. Howell Griswold for the continuation s of the<br />\nannual State appropriation to the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThis appropriation usually<br />\namounts to about $25,00o a year<br />\nand is given, usually without restriction, for the benefit of the<br />\nwhole institution. In recent years<br />\nthe legislature has made an appropriation of $5o,000 a year for<br />\nscholarships given in the school of<br />\ntechnology. The enlargement or at<br />\nleast the continuation of this endowment was the keynote of the<br />\nspeeches made by the members of<br />\nthe delegation. The seriousness of<br />\nthe situation was depicted especially<br />\nwhen this department, which is'so<br />\nyoung as to have not had a graduating class, had not received the proper financial support and attention<br />\nwhich it deserves.<br />\nReferring to the justification of<br />\ngranting 'these appropriations,<br />\nPresident Goodnow stated that the<br />\ntuition fees contributed only about<br />\n25 per cent. of Hopkins' revenue.<br />\nOn the other hand, he pointed out,<br />\nin the undergraduate department<br />\n94 out of every 'Po students are<br />\nMaryland boys; while in the school<br />\nof technology 145 out of the 148<br />\nenrolled are natives of this State.<br />\nThe proportion taking graduate<br />\nwork, of course, is much less, but<br />\neven here many students from<br />\nMaryland take advantage of the<br />\nopportunity offered in this institution for advanced instruction.<br />\nPresident Goodnow was upKoar-,_<br />\niously applauded when he replied to<br />\na query, that from the viewpoint<br />\nof those charged with the dilstribution of the State appropriations<br />\nhe believed that they shoul4 be<br />\ndiscontinued; but, on the other<br />\nhand, reviewing all phases of the<br />\nquestion from a purely educational<br />\nstandpoint, he thought that the<br />\nState officials could not persuade<br />\nthemselves to look other than<br />\nfavorably upon the matter.<br />\n<br />\nPART I.<br />\nDeVries,'88<br />\n1.

Consequently,<br />\nwith the exception of the relay<br />\nteam and a few other men, Hopkins<br />\nwill be almost entirely represented<br />\nby novices,<br />\nThe most important event of the<br />\nmeet will be the relay race between<br />\nHopkins and Georgetown. Providing Uhler and Fred Hall recover<br />\nfrom the slight injuries they received in the Georgetown University meet, and that the other members of the relay team keep in good<br />\nshape, the event should result in a<br />\nwalk-away for this University.

Goodnow, Mr. Griswold and Hopkins Trustees Appear Before Maryland Legislature to Atli State .<br />\nto Continue Grant.<br /><br />\nWith two of the best musical<br />\nclubs Hopkins has ever turned out,<br />\nwith a large and appreciative audience, and with an unusually enjoyable dance as its final feature, the<br />\n, McCoy Hall Concert last Friday<br />\nnight justified j every prediction<br />\nwhich had been made for its success. It is doubtful if a better concert has ever been given in the entire history of the clubs.<br />\nEspecial credit should be given to<br />\nthe Board of Managers for their<br />\nwork in arranging the concert. The<br />\nlarge crowd was ample evidence of<br />\nthe efficient advertising which had<br />\nbeen done, and the arrangements<br />\nthroughout gave proof of careful<br />\nand thorough organization.<br />\nThe program of the concert was<br />\nas follows:<br /><br />\nThe trustees of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity appeared last Thursday<br />\nbefore the joint meeting of the corn:mittee of the Maryland Legislature making up the Appropriation<br />\nBill, and a plea was made by President Goodnow and B. Howell Griswold for the continuation s of the<br />\nannual State appropriation to the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThis appropriation usually<br />\namounts to about $25,00o a year<br />\nand is given, usually without restriction, for the benefit of the<br />\nwhole institution. In recent years<br />\nthe legislature has made an appropriation of $5o,000 a year for<br />\nscholarships given in the school of<br />\ntechnology. The enlargement or at<br />\nleast the continuation of this endowment was the keynote of the<br />\nspeeches made by the members of<br />\nthe delegation. The seriousness of<br />\nthe situation was depicted especially<br />\nwhen this department, which is'so<br />\nyoung as to have not had a graduating class, had not received the proper financial support and attention<br />\nwhich it deserves.<br />\nReferring to the justification of<br />\ngranting 'these appropriations,<br />\nPresident Goodnow stated that the<br />\ntuition fees contributed only about<br />\n25 per cent. of Hopkins' revenue.<br />\nOn the other hand, he pointed out,<br />\nin the undergraduate department<br />\n94 out of every 'Po students are<br />\nMaryland boys; while in the school<br />\nof technology 145 out of the 148<br />\nenrolled are natives of this State.<br />\nThe proportion taking graduate<br />\nwork, of course, is much less, but<br />\neven here many students from<br />\nMaryland take advantage of the<br />\nopportunity offered in this institution for advanced instruction.<br />\nPresident Goodnow was upKoar-,_<br />\niously applauded when he replied to<br />\na query, that from the viewpoint<br />\nof those charged with the dilstribution of the State appropriations<br />\nhe believed that they shoul4 be<br />\ndiscontinued; but, on the other<br />\nhand, reviewing all phases of the<br />\nquestion from a purely educational<br />\nstandpoint, he thought that the<br />\nState officials could not persuade<br />\nthemselves to look other than<br />\nfavorably upon the matter.<br /><br />\nPART I.<br />\nDeVries,'88<br />\n1.

Consequently,<br />\nwith the exception of the relay<br />\nteam and a few other men, Hopkins<br />\nwill be almost entirely represented<br />\nby novices,<br />\nThe most important event of the<br />\nmeet will be the relay race between<br />\nHopkins and Georgetown. Providing Uhler and Fred Hall recover<br />\nfrom the slight injuries they received in the Georgetown University meet, and that the other members of the relay team keep in good<br />\nshape, the event should result in a<br />\nwalk-away for this University.
