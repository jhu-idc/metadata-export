The NEWS-LETTER believes<br />\nit has benefited greatly by its four months<br />\nof rest. It feels better able to enter<br />\ninto all the phases of our University<br />\nlife; more eager to see the interests<br />\nof Hopkins advanced; stronger to fight what<br />\nis wrong and to urge what is right. The<br />\nNEWS-LETTER will stand this year, as it has<br />\nalways stood in the past, for what is right<br />\nand manly and clean. It believes in hard<br />\nstudy, in pure athletics, in good fellowship.<br />\nIt is glad to welcome so many new students,<br />\nand asks them all\u2014medical, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate\u2014to believe that it is their<br />\npaper, devoted to their interacts.<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\n<br />\nquestion which probably arises in the<br />\nmind of every loyal student returning to the University for the new session is\u2014\"What is the situation in regard to<br />\nHomewood? What are the prospects of our<br />\nmoving? May we hope for something to turn<br />\nup, or not?\" Now, although we are very<br />\nsorry, we cannot say that we see the least<br />\nchance of moving either now or in the near<br />\nfuture. A considerable sum of money will<br />\nbe needed before it will be possible to build<br />\nat Homewood, and until this is forthcoming<br />\nwe an only wait and hope. Perhaps after<br />\na while some millionaire will recognize the<br />\nmerit of this little school and decide to give<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nit a boost, or perhaps the people of Baltimore will at some time conceive sufficient<br />\npride in their University to settle it in a<br />\ndecent lodging. But all this is in the air.<br />\nAs for us\u2014well, may our sons at least get<br />\nthe benefit of Homewood!<br />\nLD customs are not so plentiful at Hopkins as to be given up without protest. Until last year it was the practice of the senior class to arrange a number<br />\nof \"Hopkins nights\" at the theatres. On<br />\nthese occasions a jolly party of Hopkins men<br />\nfrom freshmen to graduates was sure to assemble, the \"leading lady\" would sing a<br />\nHopkins song or wave a Hopkins flag, the<br />\n\"funny man\" would crack one or two jokes<br />\nabout Hopkins, there would be a few yells<br />\nand then everyone would go home feeling<br />\nbetter and fresher than before. For the purpose of making students acquainted with<br />\neach other there is nothing to equal an oldtime \"Hopkins night.\" Seniors, why not<br />\nhave one very soon?<br />\n<br />\n()<br />\n<br />\nOW that the call has been issued for<br />\ncandidates for the football team,<br />\nand since there will doubtless be<br />\nmany competitors from the freshman class,<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER desires to use its columns<br />\nas mediums to impress upon the new men<br />\nthe high standard of \"clean playing\" which<br />\nthe University has always desired to main-<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ntam.<br />\nWe hope and believe that in most<br />\ncases the new men also desire to uphold this<br />\nstandard. However, there may be some<br />\nwho through thoughtlessness may overlook<br />\nthe fact that the student body of Johns Hopkins would as a whole rather lose all of its<br />\ngames honestly, than to win one by crooked<br />\nplaying. We take no glory in planting the<br />\nBlack and Blue colors over a victory tainted<br />\nwith the odor of foul play. It is not, and<br />\nnever will be, necessary for a team to introduce \"dirty\" playing into their contests, in<br />\norder to win distinction, for in that event<br />\nmanhood is sacrificed to baseness. Better<br />\na thousand times to dip our colors in a defeat manfully won, than to fly them in an<br />\natmosphere reeking with the smell of dishonor. Better to wipe out athletics entirely<br />\nthan to defile the escutcheon of our University with the smirch of a single unclean play.<br />\nPresident Remsen voiced the sentiments<br />\nof the student body when he said in an interview the other day. \"I enjoy, and desire<br />\nto encourage all forms of athletics that are<br />\nmanly, but when the elements of manhood<br />\nare last sight of in a sport, that sport has<br />\nmy emphatic disapproval, and I want it removed from our midst.\"<br />\nLTHOUGH, according to the terms of<br />\nthe contract, the work of laying out<br />\nthe athletic field at Homewood will<br />\nbe completed by the first of next month, the<br />\ngrounds will not be opened until the spring<br />\nseason. This delay is necessary from the<br />\nfact that the United Railways cannot have<br />\nthe projected car line to the grounds ready<br />\nbefore that time. The work on the Merryman's Lane boulevard is progressing rapidly, and when completed one of the finest<br />\ndriveways in the country will pass the gates<br />\nof our athletic grounds. No college in the<br />\nUnited tSates will then be able to boast of<br />\na better approach to its athletic field than<br />\nHopkins. With the car line passing along<br />\nthe boulevard the grounds will be within<br />\neasy reach of all, and there can hardly be<br />\nany excuse for a Hopkins student not availing himself of the opportunity to root for<br />\nhis team. While it is planned to erect eventually, stands to seat 20,000 persons, a tem-<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nporary seating capacity of 3,000 will be immediately afforded. If every student does<br />\nhis duty, there is no reason why every seat<br />\nat every game should not be occupied.<br />\nT might be interesting to note, in respect<br />\nto the wave of \"investigation\" which<br />\nis sweeping the country\u2014it seems too<br />\nearly to call it reform\u2014that even those who<br />\nexcel at the art critical are not themeslves<br />\nfree from juggling with figures. Doubtless<br />\nto many of us it was a surprise to learn from<br />\nMiss Tarbell, who, through \"McClure's Magazine,\" has been leading such a spirited attack against Mr. Rockefeller, that not so<br />\nlong ago the Johns Hopkins Hospital was<br />\nin receipt of $5,000,000 from the aforesaid<br />\ngentleman. Really, it almost took our<br />\nbreath away to think that such an amount<br />\nhad been received by the Hospital. However, on second thoughts, we remembered<br />\nthe actual state of affairs, and renewed our<br />\ncourage to read further, yet we unconsciously lost some of our faith in Miss T's accurac. Perhays even an insurance company<br />\nwould keep tab on four millions and a half!<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nR. Paul Haupt of the Semitic Department, in an interview for the \"Sun\"<br />\nupon his return from Eurpoe, paid<br />\na glowing tribute to the Johns Hopkins University. His son,who has graduated from<br />\none of the smaller colleges of Germany, expects to enter a university. He had desired<br />\nto go into the University of Berlin, the<br />\nAlma Mater of his father, but Dr. Haupt<br />\npersuaded him to come to Hopkins next<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"I persuaded him to come here,\" Dr.<br />\nHaupt said, \"because I think that Johns<br />\nHopkins offers better facilities than any university in Europe.\" Such a statement is<br />\na strong one, when it is remembered that Dr.<br />\nHaupt, besides graduating from the University of Berlin, was for several years a member of its faculty and could therefore speak<br />\nfrom an intimate comparison of the two universities, and from a close acquaintance with<br />\nthe status of every other European university.<br />\nThe opinion of Dr. Bloomfield, who has<br />\nbeen in Europe all summer, strengthens the<br />\n<br />\nD<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nimportance of Dr. Haupt's conclusions. Dr.<br />\nBloomfield said in part:<br />\n\"I was surprised at the knowledge which<br />\nthe German people have of Baltimore. They<br />\ndo not speak of it so much for its importance<br />\nas a commercial centre, but first as the seat<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University, and secondly as the scene of the disastrous fire of<br />\n1904.\"<br />\nKiochichi Morimoto, the Japanese student<br />\nhere, and a graduate of the Imperial College<br />\nof Tokio, says that he came to Johns Hopkins University for his advanced training,<br />\nbecause it is the only well-known American<br />\nunilEersity in Japan.<br />\nHE Cotillon Club for the coming season is to be organized in the near future. Though the dances which were<br />\ngiven last year were enjoyed by all who attended them, still there is room for improvement in the management of the club; and,<br />\nperhaps even more, in the attendance of the<br />\nstudents. Many of the undergraduates manifested little or no interest in the dances last<br />\nyear, and the freshman class, especially, did<br />\nnot have as good a representation at the<br />\ncotillons as it should have had. Perhaps this<br />\nlack of interest was, after all, not altogether<br />\nthe fault of the fellows, but partly that of<br />\nthose whose duty it was to solicit subscriptions for the dances. But we do not desire<br />\nto give ourselves the reputation of \"kickers.\" The dances were after all good last<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nyear. The point is, however, that they are<br />\nto be better than ever this year. We are assured that the Cotillon Club is to be organized on a strong basis. It is to be hoped that<br />\nthe students will co-operate with the managers and do everything in their power to<br />\nmake the dances thoroughly successful, both<br />\nby being \"on hand\" at every cotillon, and<br />\nby \"whooping up\" the idea. At any rate<br />\nthe Cotillon Club has the hearty wishes of<br />\nthe NEWS-LrrtR for a successful season.<br />\n<br />\nUR readers may have noticed on the<br />\ncover of theNtws-LETTER the legend<br />\n\"Published Fortnightly by the Students of the Johns Hopkins University.\"<br />\nThis implies not one-half the students, nor<br />\none-fourth, nor any other part of them; it<br />\nmeans all. It is a regrettable fact, however,<br />\nthat in recent years nearly all the work of<br />\nthe paper has been shifted onto the Borad<br />\n\u2014they not only have to edit, but they have<br />\nto write the paper as well. This is not a<br />\nsatisfactory state of affairs at all. We want<br />\neveryone to contribute to the paper\u2014stories,<br />\narticles, jokes, and poetry are all acceptable.<br />\nBesides, there will shortly be some vacancies<br />\non the Board and men will be needed to fill<br />\nthem. Here is a splendid chance for men<br />\nwith literary aspirations. Whoever wishes<br />\nto try need only apply to one of the editors,<br />\nand assignments will be given him. Really<br />\nmeritorious work is sure to make a place.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nMY FAERY QUEEN.<br />\nWhen Spencer sang in days of yore,<br />\nThe praises of his faery queen;<br />\nPerhaps he wrote twelve books or more,<br />\nOf battles, tournaments, and gore,<br />\nWith here and there some love between,<br />\nFor faery queen.<br />\nI hold a different plan in store,<br />\nFor faery queen whom I adore\u2014<br />\nOf course you know just whom I mean,<br />\nSweet faery queen.<br />\nSo when I sing your praises o'er,<br />\nI'll just scratch out the blood and gore,<br />\nAnd ever write one word above,<br />\nThe sweetest, truest name for love\u2014<br />\nMy Faery Queen.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nROUND-ABOUT WITH A SENIOR.<br />\n1. TEN MINUTES IN A STREET CAR.<br />\nThe man was fat. I do not mean corpulent, or stout, or anything but just plainly<br />\nand prosaically fat\u2014outrageously, unjustifiably fat. Moreover, he was so tall that, as<br />\nhe boarded the well-filled car, he had to<br />\nstoop to avoid striking his head against the<br />\ndoor-frame. From my standing-place at the<br />\nfront of the car, I mentally calculated his<br />\nweihgt to be about three hundred pounds.<br />\nHe moved slowly, yet irresistibly\u2014as great<br />\nmasses, according to physics, usually do move<br />\n\u2014toward the front of the car, tumbling the<br />\nlesser bodies of the other passengers to one<br />\nside or the other, for all the world like a<br />\nwhale going through a school of herring.<br />\nSomewhat to my alarm, he halted just in<br />\nfront of me, and grasped a strap by which<br />\nto support himself. I wished he had taken<br />\ntwo straps\u2014somehow one looked so insignificant in his great hand.<br />\nWith every<br />\nmovement of the car he lurched and reeled,<br />\nand swung heavier than ever upon that puny<br />\nlittle strap; making me expect, momentarily<br />\nto be sent crashing backwards through the<br />\nthin partition into the motorman. To use<br />\na favorite newspaper phrase in its literal<br />\nmeaning, here was, indeed, \"a standing<br />\nmenace to the security of life and limb.\"<br />\nI thought it would be a public-spirited action<br />\non the part of any two citizens, to get up<br />\nand give \"the menace\" a seat; but of the<br />\nonly two men on the car who had seats, one<br />\nwas asleep, and the other had for some time<br />\nbeen profoundly buried in a newspaper, in<br />\norder to avoid seeing a tired-looking little<br />\nwoman who had entered some time before.<br />\nAs we passed the market, the car stopped,<br />\nand a woman whose every feature betokened<br />\nthe shrew, came aboard. After a preliminary survey of the car and its occupants,<br />\nshe made directly for the sleeping passenger, plumped her heavy market-basket down<br />\nupon his toes, apologized loudly for having<br />\ndone so, and, in short, soon had him so<br />\nthoroughly waked up that the only thing in<br />\n<br />\nall decency he could do, was to offer her his<br />\nseat. She settled herself comfortably in it,<br />\nand then, to my horror, placed her basket<br />\ndirectly behind the uncertain knees of the<br />\nswaying colossus.<br />\nIt seemed certain that, at the very least,<br />\nhe would upset it in some of his incessant<br />\nstaggerings and shufflings. Then, poor giant!<br />\nI knew that his bulk would not save him<br />\nfrom this woman's sharp tongue. But what,<br />\nas seemed far more likely, if he should tumble into it? The basket was an unusually<br />\nlarge one, just about big enough to allow<br />\nhim tight sitting-room. The handle could<br />\nnot stop such a weight for a moment\u2014could<br />\nnot even break his fall. Worse than all, the<br />\ncontents of the basket were not such as one<br />\ncares to take any liberties with. I distinctly<br />\nsaw eggs through the chinks in the side; a<br />\nwooden platter, covered with greasy paper,<br />\nindicated lard or butter; while a dozen or<br />\nso over-ripe bananas filled in the crevices<br />\nbetween the other bundles.<br />\nSoon the car began to descend a steep<br />\nhill, and was being brought to a halt with<br />\na series of sudden jerks and jolts, becoming<br />\nmore and more violent as we neared the<br />\ncrossing. The tottering mountain of flesh<br />\nwas now panting volcanically from his exertions; and that all-important strap seemed<br />\nto have stretched in a manner that boded no<br />\ngood. A news-boy thrust his head in the<br />\ndoor. \"Wurruld, last edee-shun!\" he cried,<br />\n\"Stocks take a drop<br />\nGreat fall in \u2014\"<br />\n\u2014like a bucking broncho, the car made one<br />\nlast sickening leap, and came down flatfooted in its tracks.

The latter was carefully<br />\nrevised last spring, and the reading matter<br />\nrearranged in such a way as to make the<br />\nbook more convenient and useful. The number of memorandum pages has been increased. It is hoped that the distribution of<br />\nthe book will be completed this week.<br />\nA recitation schedule card for temporary<br />\nuse was issued this week. On the reverse<br />\nside of the card is given the football schedule, and attention is also called to the Christian Association meetings.

Moody, and each<br />\nyear since that time, the conference has<br />\nbeen held at his native town, East Northfield, Mass. At the twentieth conference<br />\nlast year, from June 30 to July 9, Johns<br />\nHopkins had thirteen representatives present, two for only part of the time. A full<br />\nreport of the conference, with a picture of<br />\nthe \"Dixie\" delegations from colleges in<br />\nthis section, may be found in the August<br />\nnumber of the \"Record of Christian Work,\"<br />\non file in Levering Hall. A more complete<br />\naccount of Hopkins' part in the conference,<br />\nwill be given at a later date, probably at<br />\none of the regular Association meetings.<br />\nIn conclusion, it may be noted that Levering Hall will be open each evening until<br />\n9 p m., until October 14. It is the wish of<br />\nthe officers that all students, whether members of the Association or not, will find the<br />\nreading room a social centre of university<br />\nlife.

It was a simple plan, based on elementary economic principles. The approbation with which the suggestion was received in all quarters Was so immediate and<br />\nso enthusiastic that we opened our columns<br />\nto a free discussion of the proposed measure,<br />\ngiving it at the same time our hearty editorial support. On May 12 we published two<br />\npages of extracts from commendatory letters received from well-known alumni and<br />\nprominent athletic workers; and on June 2<br />\npetitions to the Athletic Association from the<br />\npresent senior and junior classes, signed by<br />\npractically all the undergraduates who intended to return to the University this fall,<br />\nurging the passage of the measure. Finally,<br />\nat the last meeting of the term, the plan was<br />\napproved by the Board of Directors of the<br />\nAthletic Association, and became a law.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nThis plan was:\u2014To issue to students and<br />\nalumni, at a minimum price, season tickets admitting the purchaser to all games played in<br />\nBaltimore by Johns Hopkins aihletic teams.<br />\n<br />\nson Ticket Movement.\" To urge students<br />\nand alumni to purchase tickets would seem<br />\nentirely superfluous. Common economy<br />\nwould apparently be sufficient to induce<br />\nevery one interested in the University athletics to purchase admittance to all the games<br />\nof the year at such a bargain rate. Yet so<br />\nessential is it that the purchase of tickets be<br />\ngeneral that we feel impelled to call attention to one or two features of the situation<br />\nas it now stands.<br />\nIn the first place, in answer to popular demand, the Association put the price of tickets<br />\nso low that unless a great many are sold a<br />\nserious financial loss will result.<br />\nIn the<br />\nsecond place, a small sale of tickets would<br />\ndefeat one of the prime objects of the movement, namely, to increase the number of<br />\nrooters at games and in such manner to add<br />\nto the spirit and efficiency of the teams. The<br />\nAssociation has taken the students at their<br />\nword and issued the tickets. Every man<br />\nwith an ounce of true Hopkins spirit will<br />\npurchase, and do so at once.<br />\nTickets may be had of J. A. Addison and<br />\nthe managers of 'Varsity teams.<br />\n<br />\nFOOTBALL.<br />\n<br />\nTIE coming football season bids fair<br />\nto see one of the fastest and strongest<br />\nelevens that ever \u2022represented Johns<br />\nHopkins University on the gridiron.

The NEWS-LETTER believes<br />\nit has benefited greatly by its four months<br />\nof rest. It feels better able to enter<br />\ninto all the phases of our University<br />\nlife; more eager to see the interests<br />\nof Hopkins advanced; stronger to fight what<br />\nis wrong and to urge what is right. The<br />\nNEWS-LETTER will stand this year, as it has<br />\nalways stood in the past, for what is right<br />\nand manly and clean. It believes in hard<br />\nstudy, in pure athletics, in good fellowship.<br />\nIt is glad to welcome so many new students,<br />\nand asks them all\u2014medical, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate\u2014to believe that it is their<br />\npaper, devoted to their interacts.<br /><br />\nF<br /><br />\nquestion which probably arises in the<br />\nmind of every loyal student returning to the University for the new session is\u2014\"What is the situation in regard to<br />\nHomewood? What are the prospects of our<br />\nmoving? May we hope for something to turn<br />\nup, or not?\" Now, although we are very<br />\nsorry, we cannot say that we see the least<br />\nchance of moving either now or in the near<br />\nfuture. A considerable sum of money will<br />\nbe needed before it will be possible to build<br />\nat Homewood, and until this is forthcoming<br />\nwe an only wait and hope. Perhaps after<br />\na while some millionaire will recognize the<br />\nmerit of this little school and decide to give<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nit a boost, or perhaps the people of Baltimore will at some time conceive sufficient<br />\npride in their University to settle it in a<br />\ndecent lodging. But all this is in the air.<br />\nAs for us\u2014well, may our sons at least get<br />\nthe benefit of Homewood!<br />\nLD customs are not so plentiful at Hopkins as to be given up without protest. Until last year it was the practice of the senior class to arrange a number<br />\nof \"Hopkins nights\" at the theatres. On<br />\nthese occasions a jolly party of Hopkins men<br />\nfrom freshmen to graduates was sure to assemble, the \"leading lady\" would sing a<br />\nHopkins song or wave a Hopkins flag, the<br />\n\"funny man\" would crack one or two jokes<br />\nabout Hopkins, there would be a few yells<br />\nand then everyone would go home feeling<br />\nbetter and fresher than before. For the purpose of making students acquainted with<br />\neach other there is nothing to equal an oldtime \"Hopkins night.\" Seniors, why not<br />\nhave one very soon?<br /><br />\n()<br /><br />\nOW that the call has been issued for<br />\ncandidates for the football team,<br />\nand since there will doubtless be<br />\nmany competitors from the freshman class,<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER desires to use its columns<br />\nas mediums to impress upon the new men<br />\nthe high standard of \"clean playing\" which<br />\nthe University has always desired to main-<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ntam.<br />\nWe hope and believe that in most<br />\ncases the new men also desire to uphold this<br />\nstandard. However, there may be some<br />\nwho through thoughtlessness may overlook<br />\nthe fact that the student body of Johns Hopkins would as a whole rather lose all of its<br />\ngames honestly, than to win one by crooked<br />\nplaying. We take no glory in planting the<br />\nBlack and Blue colors over a victory tainted<br />\nwith the odor of foul play. It is not, and<br />\nnever will be, necessary for a team to introduce \"dirty\" playing into their contests, in<br />\norder to win distinction, for in that event<br />\nmanhood is sacrificed to baseness. Better<br />\na thousand times to dip our colors in a defeat manfully won, than to fly them in an<br />\natmosphere reeking with the smell of dishonor. Better to wipe out athletics entirely<br />\nthan to defile the escutcheon of our University with the smirch of a single unclean play.<br />\nPresident Remsen voiced the sentiments<br />\nof the student body when he said in an interview the other day. \"I enjoy, and desire<br />\nto encourage all forms of athletics that are<br />\nmanly, but when the elements of manhood<br />\nare last sight of in a sport, that sport has<br />\nmy emphatic disapproval, and I want it removed from our midst.\"<br />\nLTHOUGH, according to the terms of<br />\nthe contract, the work of laying out<br />\nthe athletic field at Homewood will<br />\nbe completed by the first of next month, the<br />\ngrounds will not be opened until the spring<br />\nseason. This delay is necessary from the<br />\nfact that the United Railways cannot have<br />\nthe projected car line to the grounds ready<br />\nbefore that time. The work on the Merryman's Lane boulevard is progressing rapidly, and when completed one of the finest<br />\ndriveways in the country will pass the gates<br />\nof our athletic grounds. No college in the<br />\nUnited tSates will then be able to boast of<br />\na better approach to its athletic field than<br />\nHopkins. With the car line passing along<br />\nthe boulevard the grounds will be within<br />\neasy reach of all, and there can hardly be<br />\nany excuse for a Hopkins student not availing himself of the opportunity to root for<br />\nhis team. While it is planned to erect eventually, stands to seat 20,000 persons, a tem-<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nporary seating capacity of 3,000 will be immediately afforded. If every student does<br />\nhis duty, there is no reason why every seat<br />\nat every game should not be occupied.<br />\nT might be interesting to note, in respect<br />\nto the wave of \"investigation\" which<br />\nis sweeping the country\u2014it seems too<br />\nearly to call it reform\u2014that even those who<br />\nexcel at the art critical are not themeslves<br />\nfree from juggling with figures. Doubtless<br />\nto many of us it was a surprise to learn from<br />\nMiss Tarbell, who, through \"McClure's Magazine,\" has been leading such a spirited attack against Mr. Rockefeller, that not so<br />\nlong ago the Johns Hopkins Hospital was<br />\nin receipt of $5,000,000 from the aforesaid<br />\ngentleman. Really, it almost took our<br />\nbreath away to think that such an amount<br />\nhad been received by the Hospital. However, on second thoughts, we remembered<br />\nthe actual state of affairs, and renewed our<br />\ncourage to read further, yet we unconsciously lost some of our faith in Miss T's accurac. Perhays even an insurance company<br />\nwould keep tab on four millions and a half!<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nR. Paul Haupt of the Semitic Department, in an interview for the \"Sun\"<br />\nupon his return from Eurpoe, paid<br />\na glowing tribute to the Johns Hopkins University. His son,who has graduated from<br />\none of the smaller colleges of Germany, expects to enter a university. He had desired<br />\nto go into the University of Berlin, the<br />\nAlma Mater of his father, but Dr. Haupt<br />\npersuaded him to come to Hopkins next<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"I persuaded him to come here,\" Dr.<br />\nHaupt said, \"because I think that Johns<br />\nHopkins offers better facilities than any university in Europe.\" Such a statement is<br />\na strong one, when it is remembered that Dr.<br />\nHaupt, besides graduating from the University of Berlin, was for several years a member of its faculty and could therefore speak<br />\nfrom an intimate comparison of the two universities, and from a close acquaintance with<br />\nthe status of every other European university.<br />\nThe opinion of Dr. Bloomfield, who has<br />\nbeen in Europe all summer, strengthens the<br /><br />\nD<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nimportance of Dr. Haupt's conclusions.

Though the dances which were<br />\ngiven last year were enjoyed by all who attended them, still there is room for improvement in the management of the club; and,<br />\nperhaps even more, in the attendance of the<br />\nstudents. Many of the undergraduates manifested little or no interest in the dances last<br />\nyear, and the freshman class, especially, did<br />\nnot have as good a representation at the<br />\ncotillons as it should have had. Perhaps this<br />\nlack of interest was, after all, not altogether<br />\nthe fault of the fellows, but partly that of<br />\nthose whose duty it was to solicit subscriptions for the dances. But we do not desire<br />\nto give ourselves the reputation of \"kickers.\" The dances were after all good last<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nyear. The point is, however, that they are<br />\nto be better than ever this year. We are assured that the Cotillon Club is to be organized on a strong basis. It is to be hoped that<br />\nthe students will co-operate with the managers and do everything in their power to<br />\nmake the dances thoroughly successful, both<br />\nby being \"on hand\" at every cotillon, and<br />\nby \"whooping up\" the idea. At any rate<br />\nthe Cotillon Club has the hearty wishes of<br />\nthe NEWS-LrrtR for a successful season.<br /><br />\nUR readers may have noticed on the<br />\ncover of theNtws-LETTER the legend<br />\n\"Published Fortnightly by the Students of the Johns Hopkins University.\"<br />\nThis implies not one-half the students, nor<br />\none-fourth, nor any other part of them; it<br />\nmeans all.

TEN MINUTES IN A STREET CAR.<br />\nThe man was fat. I do not mean corpulent, or stout, or anything but just plainly<br />\nand prosaically fat\u2014outrageously, unjustifiably fat. Moreover, he was so tall that, as<br />\nhe boarded the well-filled car, he had to<br />\nstoop to avoid striking his head against the<br />\ndoor-frame. From my standing-place at the<br />\nfront of the car, I mentally calculated his<br />\nweihgt to be about three hundred pounds.<br />\nHe moved slowly, yet irresistibly\u2014as great<br />\nmasses, according to physics, usually do move<br />\n\u2014toward the front of the car, tumbling the<br />\nlesser bodies of the other passengers to one<br />\nside or the other, for all the world like a<br />\nwhale going through a school of herring.<br />\nSomewhat to my alarm, he halted just in<br />\nfront of me, and grasped a strap by which<br />\nto support himself. I wished he had taken<br />\ntwo straps\u2014somehow one looked so insignificant in his great hand.<br />\nWith every<br />\nmovement of the car he lurched and reeled,<br />\nand swung heavier than ever upon that puny<br />\nlittle strap; making me expect, momentarily<br />\nto be sent crashing backwards through the<br />\nthin partition into the motorman. To use<br />\na favorite newspaper phrase in its literal<br />\nmeaning, here was, indeed, \"a standing<br />\nmenace to the security of life and limb.\"<br />\nI thought it would be a public-spirited action<br />\non the part of any two citizens, to get up<br />\nand give \"the menace\" a seat; but of the<br />\nonly two men on the car who had seats, one<br />\nwas asleep, and the other had for some time<br />\nbeen profoundly buried in a newspaper, in<br />\norder to avoid seeing a tired-looking little<br />\nwoman who had entered some time before.<br />\nAs we passed the market, the car stopped,<br />\nand a woman whose every feature betokened<br />\nthe shrew, came aboard. After a preliminary survey of the car and its occupants,<br />\nshe made directly for the sleeping passenger, plumped her heavy market-basket down<br />\nupon his toes, apologized loudly for having<br />\ndone so, and, in short, soon had him so<br />\nthoroughly waked up that the only thing in<br /><br />\nall decency he could do, was to offer her his<br />\nseat. She settled herself comfortably in it,<br />\nand then, to my horror, placed her basket<br />\ndirectly behind the uncertain knees of the<br />\nswaying colossus.<br />\nIt seemed certain that, at the very least,<br />\nhe would upset it in some of his incessant<br />\nstaggerings and shufflings. Then, poor giant!<br />\nI knew that his bulk would not save him<br />\nfrom this woman's sharp tongue. But what,<br />\nas seemed far more likely, if he should tumble into it? The basket was an unusually<br />\nlarge one, just about big enough to allow<br />\nhim tight sitting-room. The handle could<br />\nnot stop such a weight for a moment\u2014could<br />\nnot even break his fall. Worse than all, the<br />\ncontents of the basket were not such as one<br />\ncares to take any liberties with. I distinctly<br />\nsaw eggs through the chinks in the side; a<br />\nwooden platter, covered with greasy paper,<br />\nindicated lard or butter; while a dozen or<br />\nso over-ripe bananas filled in the crevices<br />\nbetween the other bundles.<br />\nSoon the car began to descend a steep<br />\nhill, and was being brought to a halt with<br />\na series of sudden jerks and jolts, becoming<br />\nmore and more violent as we neared the<br />\ncrossing. The tottering mountain of flesh<br />\nwas now panting volcanically from his exertions; and that all-important strap seemed<br />\nto have stretched in a manner that boded no<br />\ngood. A news-boy thrust his head in the<br />\ndoor. \"Wurruld, last edee-shun!\" he cried,<br />\n\"Stocks take a drop<br />\nGreat fall in \u2014\"<br />\n\u2014like a bucking broncho, the car made one<br />\nlast sickening leap, and came down flatfooted in its tracks. Then, horrible vision!<br />\nI thought I saw the unfortunate giant in<br />\nthe very act of descending, coat-tails foremost, into the basket! Live stock was going<br />\ndown, groceries up! I turned my head to<br />\navoid seeing the catastrophe. When I looked<br />\nagain, I saw the unconscious object of my<br />\nmistaken soleiitude\u2014calmly buying a newspaper<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE END OF SUMMER.<br />\nHere I'm back at work again,<br />\nCramming down the lessons long,<br />\nFar away the summer seems,<br />\nFar away as dearest dreams,<br />\nLeft sans woman, and sans song.<br />\nTediously the hours drag,<br />\nSilently and slowly by,<br />\nSummer seconds used to be<br />\nMuch more precious yet to me,<br />\nThan the days that now are nigh.<br />\nWonder I how gay Clarice,<br />\nLikes the bustling, noisy town;<br />\nNow no more in my canoe,<br />\nCan we paddle 'neath the blue,<br />\n'Till the smiling moon goes down.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nSPARKS.<br />\nMoney is the \"root\" of all evil\u2014and the<br />\nlack of it a public \"bark,\"<br />\nThe unexpected results of the Peace Conference makes us think of the envoys as<br />\nMonsieur Witty and Baron Kum-over.<br />\nIt is useless to cry over spilled milk\u2014or<br />\nto sigh over spoiled meat.<br />\nIt is hoped, that, after the insurance investigations, some of the companies will<br />\nchange their \"policies.\"<br />\nHorse-race maxim\u2014Mares make the money<br />\ngo.<br />\nBy a simple change a railroad may be<br />\nmade to \"be-rate\" its \"re-bate.\"<br /><br />\nAh, those drives with charming Nell,<br />\nDoes she think of them at all;<br />\nHow we got back late to tea,<br />\nAnd those glorious sails at sea,<br />\nWhen we weathered many a squall?<br /><br />\nA weak will and a week hence go handin-hand.<br /><br />\nDoes dear Janice miss the golf<br />\nWhich together we did play?<br />\n(Though I must confess, perforce<br />\nThat we'd sometimes lose the course),<br />\nQueer, how oft we went astray.<br /><br />\nIN THE BARBER SHOP.<br />\nIrate Student\u2014You don't call this the real<br />\narticle, do you?<br />\nWalter\u2014Oh, no, sir; this is only a shampoo, sir.<br /><br />\nThen the tennis with Louise,<br />\n(Love sets were quite all we knew);<br />\nAnd the horseback rides with Pol,<br />\nAnd the fishing days with Do!,<br />\nNot forgetting swims with Sue.<br /><br />\nQuestion\u2014Why is marriage like building?<br />\nAnswer\u2014Because thereby a man sometimes adds an 'ell to his home.<br /><br />\nOh ,the songs that Helen sang,<br />\nOh, the music of Marie's,<br />\nOh, the walks with Edna fair,<br />\nAnd the talks with Lisbeth rare,<br />\nCould one ask aught else to please?<br />\nStrange it seems at last to leave them,<br />\nAnd the place where pleasures lurk;<br />\nStrange Why yes, 'tis most enraging,<br />\nAfter all that sweet engaging,<br />\nTo be wedded to one's work!<br /><br />\nA hit in time saves the nine.<br /><br />\nAnother Freshman\u2014Why do they call the<br />\nfootball a pig-skin?\"<br />\nSame Senior\u2014Because it's sometimes on<br />\nthe hog.<br />\n\"England expects every man to pay his<br />\nduty,\" remarked the polite revenue officer<br />\nto the captured smuggler.<br />\nShow your appreciation of the Athletic Association's public-spirited action, as well as your<br />\nown common sense, by purchasing a season<br />\nticket at once.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nHAIL TO HOPKINS!<br />\n(To the tune of \"Hail Columbia.\")<br />\nHail to Hopkins tried and true!<br />\nHail her colors Black and Blue!<br />\nAll her students will avow,<br />\nShe's the real cheese anyhow.<br />\nHail<br />\nHail<br />\nMay<br />\nMay<br /><br />\nher heroes on the field!<br />\ntheir victories unconcealed<br />\nher foes be vanquished all,<br />\nher standards never fall.<br /><br />\nSo Rah for Hopkins, one and all!<br />\nRah for Remsen, Griffin, Ball!<br />\nWhat might happen, who can tell?<br />\nSo Rah! boys Rah! and Rah like<br />\nHail to Hopkins tried and true!<br />\nHail her colors Black and Blue<br />\nAll her students will avow,<br />\nShe's the real cheese anyhow.<br /><br />\nWILTED FRESHNESS.<br />\nWith bated breath and beating heart, the<br />\nFreshman stands quivering for a moment,<br />\nand then suddenly the bunch of youthfulness becomes an animated streak of green.<br />\nBut alack and alas, the Freshie runs into the<br />\nopen arms of another crowd of persecutors.<br />\nMany of these Freshmen will remember to<br />\ndeath, the grim details of the entertainment<br />\nwhich they afforded last spring when, fresh<br />\nand pink from the prep. schools, they were<br />\nfiled into a certain back yard.<br />\nA circus awaited the Seniors who sat upon<br />\nthe fence, and the ring-masters from the<br />\nJunior class were not long in showing off<br />\nthe characteristics of the specimens they had<br />\nunder charge.

The latter was carefully<br />\nrevised last spring, and the reading matter<br />\nrearranged in such a way as to make the<br />\nbook more convenient and useful. The number of memorandum pages has been increased. It is hoped that the distribution of<br />\nthe book will be completed this week.<br />\nA recitation schedule card for temporary<br />\nuse was issued this week. On the reverse<br />\nside of the card is given the football schedule, and attention is also called to the Christian Association meetings. Not only should<br />\nevery student do his best to attend all the<br />\nfootabll games, but he should also plan to<br />\ngive the Association services a place on his<br />\nschedule, as a part of the student activity<br />\nof the University.

M. C. A.'s may not be out of<br />\nplace at present. These summer gatherings<br />\nof college men were started in 1886, at the<br />\nsuggestion of Dwight L. Moody, and each<br />\nyear since that time, the conference has<br />\nbeen held at his native town, East Northfield, Mass. At the twentieth conference<br />\nlast year, from June 30 to July 9, Johns<br />\nHopkins had thirteen representatives present, two for only part of the time. A full<br />\nreport of the conference, with a picture of<br />\nthe \"Dixie\" delegations from colleges in<br />\nthis section, may be found in the August<br />\nnumber of the \"Record of Christian Work,\"<br />\non file in Levering Hall. A more complete<br />\naccount of Hopkins' part in the conference,<br />\nwill be given at a later date, probably at<br />\none of the regular Association meetings.<br />\nIn conclusion, it may be noted that Levering Hall will be open each evening until<br />\n9 p m., until October 14. It is the wish of<br />\nthe officers that all students, whether members of the Association or not, will find the<br />\nreading room a social centre of university<br />\nlife.

It was a simple plan, based on elementary economic principles. The approbation with which the suggestion was received in all quarters Was so immediate and<br />\nso enthusiastic that we opened our columns<br />\nto a free discussion of the proposed measure,<br />\ngiving it at the same time our hearty editorial support. On May 12 we published two<br />\npages of extracts from commendatory letters received from well-known alumni and<br />\nprominent athletic workers; and on June 2<br />\npetitions to the Athletic Association from the<br />\npresent senior and junior classes, signed by<br />\npractically all the undergraduates who intended to return to the University this fall,<br />\nurging the passage of the measure. Finally,<br />\nat the last meeting of the term, the plan was<br />\napproved by the Board of Directors of the<br />\nAthletic Association, and became a law.<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nThis plan was:\u2014To issue to students and<br />\nalumni, at a minimum price, season tickets admitting the purchaser to all games played in<br />\nBaltimore by Johns Hopkins aihletic teams.<br /><br />\nson Ticket Movement.\" To urge students<br />\nand alumni to purchase tickets would seem<br />\nentirely superfluous. Common economy<br />\nwould apparently be sufficient to induce<br />\nevery one interested in the University athletics to purchase admittance to all the games<br />\nof the year at such a bargain rate. Yet so<br />\nessential is it that the purchase of tickets be<br />\ngeneral that we feel impelled to call attention to one or two features of the situation<br />\nas it now stands.<br />\nIn the first place, in answer to popular demand, the Association put the price of tickets<br />\nso low that unless a great many are sold a<br />\nserious financial loss will result.<br />\nIn the<br />\nsecond place, a small sale of tickets would<br />\ndefeat one of the prime objects of the movement, namely, to increase the number of<br />\nrooters at games and in such manner to add<br />\nto the spirit and efficiency of the teams. The<br />\nAssociation has taken the students at their<br />\nword and issued the tickets. Every man<br />\nwith an ounce of true Hopkins spirit will<br />\npurchase, and do so at once.<br />\nTickets may be had of J. A.
