The unit of survey is a quadrangle bounded by parallels of latitude and meridians of<br />\nlongitude, but different quadrangles are mapped on different scales, and consequently the standard<br />\nmaps,'though of nearly uniform size (about 164 by 20 inches), represent areas of different sizes.<br />\nThe standard scales are 1:31,680 (1 inch \u2014one-half mile), 1:62,500 (1 inch=nearly 1 mile), and<br />\n1:125,000 (1 inch =nearly 2 miles). Some maps are published on special scales for special pur-<br />\nposes. Each quadrangle is designated by the name of a city, town, or prominent natural feature<br />\nwithin it, and on the margins of the map are printed the names of adjoining quadrangles of which<br />\nmaps have been published. The maps are engraved on copper and printed from stone, in three<br />\ncolors. The cultural features, such as roads, railroads, cities, and towns, as well as the lettering,<br />\nare in black ; the water features are in blue; and the features of relief\u2014hills, mountains, etc.\u2014are<br />\nshown by brown contour lines. The contour interval differs according to the scale of the map and<br />\nthe relief of the country. On some maps the contour lines are supplemented by shading, which<br />\ngives a more pictorial representation of the relief, and on some maps woodland areas are shown in<br />\ngreen and special features in other colors.<br />\n<br />\nMaryland and Delaware are now completely mapped, as shown on the index map within.<br />\nThe surveys in Maryland from 1896 to 1912 were made in cooperation with the State. Each of the<br />\nrectangles outlined in red on the index map shows the location and area of a quadrangle of which<br />\na topographic survey has been made. The name of the resulting topographic map, if published,<br />\nis also shown, and its scale is indicated by the size of the rectangle; thus the larger rectangles indi-<br />\ncate the smaller-scale maps and the smaller rectangles the larger-scale maps. For areas represented<br />\nby small rectangles within larger ones maps on different scales have been published. Each of<br />\nthe maps represented by the smaller rectangles shows a quadrangle measuring 15\u2019 each way (one-<br />\nsixteenth of a \u201csquare degree\u2019\u2019), or from 229 to 236 square miles, the area differing according<br />\nto the latitude. The scale is 1:62,500, or about 1 mile to 1 inch, and the contour interval is<br />\neither 10 or 20 feet, but as the entire area shown on two of the maps in Maryland is less than<br />\n5 feet above sea level these maps have no contour lines. Each of the maps represented by the<br />\nlarger rectangles shows a quadrangle measuring 30\u2019 each way (one-fourth of a \u2018\u2018square degree\u2019\u2019),<br />\nor from 919 to 938 square miles. The scale is 1:125,000, or about 2 miles to 1 inch, and the con-<br />\ntour interval ranges from 10 to 100 feet. The whole number of published topographic maps cover-<br />\ning quadrangles in Maryland is 81, in Delaware 21. If maps covering areas in both States are<br />\ncounted only once the total is 93. A list of special maps and sheets is given on page 6.<br />\n<br />\nThe price of the standard maps of either large or small quadrangles is 10 cents each, but a<br />\ndiscount of 40 per cent is allowed on an order amounting to %5 at the retail price\u2014that is, the<br />\nwholesale rate for standard topographic maps is $3 for 50.
