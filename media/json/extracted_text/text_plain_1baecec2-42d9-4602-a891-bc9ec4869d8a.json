Namor<br />\n<br />\nAn Open Board<br />\nA recent Hopkins graduate finds his way to a seat on<br />\nthe Board of Trustees blocked by an archaic by-law<br />\nwhich prohibits any alumnus from becoming a Trustee<br />\nuntil he has been out of Hopkins five years. The Trustees<br />\napparently feel this will guarantee a wise and mature<br />\nmembership; rather, it seems more like a design to<br />\nkeep themselves further isolated from those close to<br />\nstudent opinion.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees has the final, absolute<br />\nauthority over all University matters. Yet students are<br />\nchanging at a rapid pace, and the University will,<br />\nhopefully, be asked to improve its relationship with<br />\nsociety and its own academic community. The Trustees,<br />\nhowever, with their built-in time lag, are setting the<br />\nstage for the acute crisis that inevitably develops when<br />\nan institution becomes too rigid to make needed<br />\nreforms. They see the Hopkins academic community<br />\nthrough the prism of the alumni magazine, Dr. Gordon's<br />\npresentations, and editorials in the Baltimore Sun.<br />\nWhile we don't expect the Board to become a<br />\nvanguard of the revolution with the addition of a few<br />\nyoung alumni, their presence could add new<br />\nperspectives to the Trustees' narrow views. At the very<br />\nleast, communication could begin between those who<br />\nmake policy and those who have to live with it. In fact,<br />\nthe University would benefit from regular contacts<br />\nbetween Board members, students and faculty. For<br />\nexample, with the present enfeebled position of<br />\nundergraduate education, it is nothing less than absurd<br />\nfor a Trustee to assert, \"We don't need any more<br />\nrepresentation of undergraduate viewpoint on the<br />\nBoard. We already have enough.\"<br />\nBecoming an alumni trustee will not be easy for young<br />\ngraduates, even if the five-year clause is actually<br />\nremoved. They also have to be nominated and elected by<br />\nan Alumni Association not noted for its innovation. But<br />\nfor the sake of the University, the Board should<br />\nimmediately join with a number of other schools<br />\nthroughout the country and open the way to younger<br />\nand more diverse views.<br />\n<br />\nBold Innovation<br />\nFreshman seminars, as every department chairman<br />\nwill glibly tell you, is a good idea. But, as is often true at<br />\nHopkins, faculty members become too engrossed with<br />\nacademic innovations and many times forget longrange problems.<br />\nA few years ago, the Biology Department began<br />\nfreshman seminars. Now Computer Sciences, English,<br />\nSocial Relations,Physics and German are following suit<br />\nnext fall. Who knows, maybe in a few more years there<br />\nwill be more freshman seminars and even seminars<br />\nopen to sophomores, juniors and seniors.<br />\nIt's simply terrifying to think of all the course choices<br />\neach student will have to make every September and<br />\nJanuary if this happens. We urge that a faculty-student<br />\ncommittee (with equal representation and open<br />\nmeetings) be formed to judiciously consider this matter.<br />\nWithout prior thought, Homewood may become<br />\ninundated with classes, ruining the current<br />\nundergraduates' idyllic life.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nNo ultimatum has been<br />\nissued by the Student Council<br />\nconcerning its Report on the<br />\nquality of Undergraduate<br />\nEducation.<br />\nAt its last meeting, the<br />\nCouncil considered the<br />\nprovisions of the report, and<br />\nonly after much argument<br />\npassed the nine points of<br />\nwhich the report consists.<br />\nThe S.C. then authorized<br />\nthe President to transmit the<br />\nreport to the Academic<br />\nCouncil, with its request that<br />\nthe A.C. give the points its<br />\nconsideration at its next<br />\nmeeting, and failing that, at<br />\nits earliest convenience.<br />\nIt was clearly felt by all of<br />\nthe Council that it did not<br />\nwant the report buried in a<br />\ncommittee, even one so<br />\ncommendable as the Blue<br />\nRibbon Commission on<br />\nUndergraduate Education.<br />\nSeveral of the points can,<br />\nwe believe, be acted upon<br />\nrapidly through a process of<br />\nnegotiation. Never was there<br />\na mention of the words \"nonnegotiable\" in association<br />\nwith any of the points made in<br />\nthe report. We are not so<br />\nconfident as to believe. that<br />\nwe have the final answer to<br />\nany of the problems discussed<br />\ntherein, simply that we<br />\nbelieve that we have an<br />\nanswer.<br />\nLastly, the Student Council<br />\ndiscussed possible recourse<br />\nthat it could take, if all of the<br />\nrevisions in<br />\nsuggested<br />\n<br />\ncool7t<br />\n<br />\nEducation<br />\nUndergraduate<br />\nwere either dismissed out of<br />\nhand, or if negotiations<br />\nreached a point where no<br />\nsubstantial progress could be<br />\nmade because of faculty<br />\nintransigence. No threat was<br />\nintended.<br />\nIt is my belief that an<br />\naccord can be reached on<br />\nmost, if not all of the report's<br />\npoints, through discussion,<br />\nand not through the issuance<br />\nof an ultimatum.<br />\nbe<br />\nmay<br />\nThus, this<br />\nconsidered an apology for any<br />\nmistaken impressions that<br />\nmay have been fomented by<br />\ncommunications difficulties.<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council, I<br />\nbelieve, is ready and eager to<br />\ndiscuss the provisions of its<br />\nor<br />\nreport,<br />\ninformally<br />\nformally, individually or<br />\ncollectively, with any and all<br />\nmembers of the Academic<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nWe can, I believe, arrive at<br />\na consensus which will be<br />\nmutually beneficial to all<br />\nconcerned groups, and which<br />\nwill improve the quality of<br />\nlife, especially, for the<br />\nHopkins undergraduate body.<br />\nD.

University<br />\ndeficits, as a result of rising costs and<br />\ndeclining research funds, have become'<br />\ncritical in the past two years, with no end in<br />\nsight. As the deficits increase, colleges must<br />\nraise tuition, thereby further threatening<br />\nfamily budgets, already hard-pressed by<br />\ninflation and recession.<br />\nLast week President Nixon sent to<br />\nCongress a program designed to aid the<br />\nstudents. But the package, if Congress<br />\napproves it, would do little for the colleges<br />\nand might leave them deeper in the red.<br />\nIronically, despite its stress on student aid,<br />\nthe proposal was greeted with reservations<br />\neven on that score.<br />\nFewer Grants'<br />\nAt the heart of the President's plan is<br />\nincreased reliance on loans rather than<br />\ngrants. Many educators consider this<br />\nconcept sound because it may enhance the<br />\nstudent's appreciation of his education's<br />\nvalue if he had made a personal investment.<br />\nFor students from the lowest income<br />\nfamilies, the largest proportion of the aid<br />\npackage would be a direct grant of $1,000 a<br />\nyear, augmented by a $400 loan. Moreover,<br />\nfor children with,families with incomes of<br />\n$10,000 or less, the loan portion is interestFred M. Hechinger is Education Editor for the<br />\nNew York Times.<br />\n<br />\nfree, Federally subsidized, and repayable in<br />\nup to 20 years at a low three per cent rate. All<br />\nloans are to be made by private money<br />\nlenders, not the Government.<br />\nFamilies in income brackets above the<br />\nsubsidized loan cutoff level would be eligible<br />\nfor a new form of loans--guaranteed by the<br />\nGovernment but not subsidized. A subsidized<br />\nloan carries rates lower than prevailing<br />\nrates, with the Government making up the<br />\ndifference. With a guaranteed loan, the<br />\nGovernment pays none of the interest but<br />\ninsures repayment of the loan.<br />\nAlthough the Administration has offered<br />\nassurances that the guaranteed loans would<br />\nbe freely available, they would be repayable<br />\nat or near the going rate. For long-term<br />\nloans, this would result in an increase of the<br />\ntuition costs. The Government hopes,<br />\nhowever, that the banks would show their<br />\nappreciation for the risk-free nature of the<br />\nloans by offering some special discounts.<br />\nHowever, past experience has shown that<br />\nbanks have little enthusiasm for student<br />\nloans during tight-money periods.<br />\nSince the new Nixon proposal would lower<br />\neligibility for the subsidized low-interest<br />\nloans from the present $15,000 to the $10,000<br />\nbracket, a sizable segment of middle-class<br />\nfamilies would feel an additional pinch.<br />\nAnd, apart from an institution's own<br />\nscholarship subsidies, more students mean<br />\ngreater deficits. University leaders are<br />\nasking for matching grants to the schools<br />\nwhich admit aided students.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMARCH 2, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPrattStreet Boutique: Quality atLow Price<br />\nBy BRENT McLAUGHLIN<br />\nThe<br />\nStreet<br />\nPratt<br />\nConspiracy is a boutique like<br />\nany other --except<br />\neverything's at half price.<br />\nAnd, for one dollar,<br />\ncommunity residents and<br />\nstudents may obtain a<br />\nConspiracy membership card<br />\nWhich. entitles them to an<br />\nadditional 20 per cent<br />\ndiscount.

This imbalance has led to the<br />\nPerfunctory and often ignored exercise.<br />\nUndergraduates suffer as a result. Our education has been<br />\ncharacterized by a malignant neglect perpetuated by both faculty and<br />\nadministration, contributing to the scanty course offerings, the large<br />\nenrollments within these courses, and the unavailability of professors.<br />\nUndergraduates soon visualize graduate research as a parasitical<br />\ncompetitor for university resources that steadily eats away the<br />\npossible benefits of Hopkins' undergraduate education.<br />\nPriorities have been set: the undergraduate is dispensible. Our<br />\neducation continues to be sacrificed to the interests of graduate<br />\nresearch. To correct this imbalance of emphasis, we demand a shift in<br />\npriorities. After 95 years, the time has come for Hopkins to finally<br />\nmake a commitment to undergraduate education.<br />\nSUMMARY OF PROPOSALS<br />\n1) Rapid changes can best be made within the present framework.<br />\n2) Each department shall offer a number of courses per semester<br />\nequal to the number of full-time faculty in the department.<br />\n3) One-third of the faculty shall offer seminars every semester.<br />\nEach faculty member shall teach one seminar every third semester.<br />\na) Seminar size shall not exceed 15 students<br />\nb) Any students may sign up, but departmental majors shall be<br />\n<br />\ngiven first consideration.<br />\n4) In hiring and promotion of faculty, teaching capability shall<br />\nreceive equal recognition with the other primary criteria, research<br />\nand publication.<br />\n5) Faculty shall submit course descriptions with preferred class time<br />\nto the Registrar, who will resolve conflicts in the interests of students.<br />\n6) Courses not taught for two consecutive years shall be dropped<br />\nfrom the catalogue. The catalogue shall also list when courses will be<br />\ntaught (the semester).<br />\n7) The Social Relations Department shall offer an undergraduate<br />\nmajor.<br />\n8) \u2022 Sabbatical policy must be regulated to avoid multiple<br />\ndepartmental vacancies and repeated leaves.<br />\n9) Independent study is not a panacea for all undergraduate<br />\nproblems. It is only one ingredient of a quality education.<br />\nCONCLUSION<br />\npresented to correct only the most glaring<br />\nwere<br />\nproposals<br />\nThese nine<br />\neducation. As President<br />\nundergraduate<br />\ndeficiencies of Hopkins<br />\nGordon told the Hearings Committee, \"the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences can do a substantially better job than is now done.\" Our<br />\nsolutions are an essential first step in the process of upgrading the<br />\nquality of undergraduate education at Hopkins. These solutions can<br />\nand should be implemented at once.

Yet students are<br />\nchanging at a rapid pace, and the University will,<br />\nhopefully, be asked to improve its relationship with<br />\nsociety and its own academic community. The Trustees,<br />\nhowever, with their built-in time lag, are setting the<br />\nstage for the acute crisis that inevitably develops when<br />\nan institution becomes too rigid to make needed<br />\nreforms. They see the Hopkins academic community<br />\nthrough the prism of the alumni magazine, Dr. Gordon's<br />\npresentations, and editorials in the Baltimore Sun.<br />\nWhile we don't expect the Board to become a<br />\nvanguard of the revolution with the addition of a few<br />\nyoung alumni, their presence could add new<br />\nperspectives to the Trustees' narrow views. At the very<br />\nleast, communication could begin between those who<br />\nmake policy and those who have to live with it. In fact,<br />\nthe University would benefit from regular contacts<br />\nbetween Board members, students and faculty. For<br />\nexample, with the present enfeebled position of<br />\nundergraduate education, it is nothing less than absurd<br />\nfor a Trustee to assert, \"We don't need any more<br />\nrepresentation of undergraduate viewpoint on the<br />\nBoard. We already have enough.\"<br />\nBecoming an alumni trustee will not be easy for young<br />\ngraduates, even if the five-year clause is actually<br />\nremoved. They also have to be nominated and elected by<br />\nan Alumni Association not noted for its innovation. But<br />\nfor the sake of the University, the Board should<br />\nimmediately join with a number of other schools<br />\nthroughout the country and open the way to younger<br />\nand more diverse views.<br /><br />\nBold Innovation<br />\nFreshman seminars, as every department chairman<br />\nwill glibly tell you, is a good idea. But, as is often true at<br />\nHopkins, faculty members become too engrossed with<br />\nacademic innovations and many times forget longrange problems.<br />\nA few years ago, the Biology Department began<br />\nfreshman seminars. Now Computer Sciences, English,<br />\nSocial Relations,Physics and German are following suit<br />\nnext fall. Who knows, maybe in a few more years there<br />\nwill be more freshman seminars and even seminars<br />\nopen to sophomores, juniors and seniors.<br />\nIt's simply terrifying to think of all the course choices<br />\neach student will have to make every September and<br />\nJanuary if this happens. We urge that a faculty-student<br />\ncommittee (with equal representation and open<br />\nmeetings) be formed to judiciously consider this matter.<br />\nWithout prior thought, Homewood may become<br />\ninundated with classes, ruining the current<br />\nundergraduates' idyllic life.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nNo ultimatum has been<br />\nissued by the Student Council<br />\nconcerning its Report on the<br />\nquality of Undergraduate<br />\nEducation.<br />\nAt its last meeting, the<br />\nCouncil considered the<br />\nprovisions of the report, and<br />\nonly after much argument<br />\npassed the nine points of<br />\nwhich the report consists.<br />\nThe S.C. then authorized<br />\nthe President to transmit the<br />\nreport to the Academic<br />\nCouncil, with its request that<br />\nthe A.C. give the points its<br />\nconsideration at its next<br />\nmeeting, and failing that, at<br />\nits earliest convenience.<br />\nIt was clearly felt by all of<br />\nthe Council that it did not<br />\nwant the report buried in a<br />\ncommittee, even one so<br />\ncommendable as the Blue<br />\nRibbon Commission on<br />\nUndergraduate Education.<br />\nSeveral of the points can,<br />\nwe believe, be acted upon<br />\nrapidly through a process of<br />\nnegotiation. Never was there<br />\na mention of the words \"nonnegotiable\" in association<br />\nwith any of the points made in<br />\nthe report. We are not so<br />\nconfident as to believe. that<br />\nwe have the final answer to<br />\nany of the problems discussed<br />\ntherein, simply that we<br />\nbelieve that we have an<br />\nanswer.<br />\nLastly, the Student Council<br />\ndiscussed possible recourse<br />\nthat it could take, if all of the<br />\nrevisions in<br />\nsuggested<br /><br />\ncool7t<br /><br />\nEducation<br />\nUndergraduate<br />\nwere either dismissed out of<br />\nhand, or if negotiations<br />\nreached a point where no<br />\nsubstantial progress could be<br />\nmade because of faculty<br />\nintransigence. No threat was<br />\nintended.<br />\nIt is my belief that an<br />\naccord can be reached on<br />\nmost, if not all of the report's<br />\npoints, through discussion,<br />\nand not through the issuance<br />\nof an ultimatum.<br />\nbe<br />\nmay<br />\nThus, this<br />\nconsidered an apology for any<br />\nmistaken impressions that<br />\nmay have been fomented by<br />\ncommunications difficulties.<br /><br />\nThe Student Council, I<br />\nbelieve, is ready and eager to<br />\ndiscuss the provisions of its<br />\nor<br />\nreport,<br />\ninformally<br />\nformally, individually or<br />\ncollectively, with any and all<br />\nmembers of the Academic<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nWe can, I believe, arrive at<br />\na consensus which will be<br />\nmutually beneficial to all<br />\nconcerned groups, and which<br />\nwill improve the quality of<br />\nlife, especially, for the<br />\nHopkins undergraduate body.<br />\nD. Christopher ohly<br />\nRepresentative, Class of '72<br /><br />\nCollege Aid<br /><br />\nNot Much Help<br />\nFred M. Hechinger<br />\nAmerican higher education faces two<br />\nthe<br />\nproblems:<br />\nseparate<br />\nfinancial<br />\nuniversities' deficits and the students' (or<br />\ntheir parents') strained budgets. University<br />\ndeficits, as a result of rising costs and<br />\ndeclining research funds, have become'<br />\ncritical in the past two years, with no end in<br />\nsight. As the deficits increase, colleges must<br />\nraise tuition, thereby further threatening<br />\nfamily budgets, already hard-pressed by<br />\ninflation and recession.<br />\nLast week President Nixon sent to<br />\nCongress a program designed to aid the<br />\nstudents. But the package, if Congress<br />\napproves it, would do little for the colleges<br />\nand might leave them deeper in the red.<br />\nIronically, despite its stress on student aid,<br />\nthe proposal was greeted with reservations<br />\neven on that score.<br />\nFewer Grants'<br />\nAt the heart of the President's plan is<br />\nincreased reliance on loans rather than<br />\ngrants. Many educators consider this<br />\nconcept sound because it may enhance the<br />\nstudent's appreciation of his education's<br />\nvalue if he had made a personal investment.<br />\nFor students from the lowest income<br />\nfamilies, the largest proportion of the aid<br />\npackage would be a direct grant of $1,000 a<br />\nyear, augmented by a $400 loan. Moreover,<br />\nfor children with,families with incomes of<br />\n$10,000 or less, the loan portion is interestFred M. Hechinger is Education Editor for the<br />\nNew York Times.<br /><br />\nfree, Federally subsidized, and repayable in<br />\nup to 20 years at a low three per cent rate. All<br />\nloans are to be made by private money<br />\nlenders, not the Government.<br />\nFamilies in income brackets above the<br />\nsubsidized loan cutoff level would be eligible<br />\nfor a new form of loans--guaranteed by the<br />\nGovernment but not subsidized. A subsidized<br />\nloan carries rates lower than prevailing<br />\nrates, with the Government making up the<br />\ndifference. With a guaranteed loan, the<br />\nGovernment pays none of the interest but<br />\ninsures repayment of the loan.<br />\nAlthough the Administration has offered<br />\nassurances that the guaranteed loans would<br />\nbe freely available, they would be repayable<br />\nat or near the going rate. For long-term<br />\nloans, this would result in an increase of the<br />\ntuition costs. The Government hopes,<br />\nhowever, that the banks would show their<br />\nappreciation for the risk-free nature of the<br />\nloans by offering some special discounts.<br />\nHowever, past experience has shown that<br />\nbanks have little enthusiasm for student<br />\nloans during tight-money periods.<br />\nSince the new Nixon proposal would lower<br />\neligibility for the subsidized low-interest<br />\nloans from the present $15,000 to the $10,000<br />\nbracket, a sizable segment of middle-class<br />\nfamilies would feel an additional pinch.<br />\nAnd, apart from an institution's own<br />\nscholarship subsidies, more students mean<br />\ngreater deficits. University leaders are<br />\nasking for matching grants to the schools<br />\nwhich admit aided students.<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nMARCH 2, 1971<br /><br />\nPrattStreet Boutique: Quality atLow Price<br />\nBy BRENT McLAUGHLIN<br />\nThe<br />\nStreet<br />\nPratt<br />\nConspiracy is a boutique like<br />\nany other --except<br />\neverything's at half price.<br />\nAnd, for one dollar,<br />\ncommunity residents and<br />\nstudents may obtain a<br />\nConspiracy membership card<br />\nWhich. entitles them to an<br />\nadditional 20 per cent<br />\ndiscount.

This imbalance has led to the<br />\nPerfunctory and often ignored exercise.<br />\nUndergraduates suffer as a result. Our education has been<br />\ncharacterized by a malignant neglect perpetuated by both faculty and<br />\nadministration, contributing to the scanty course offerings, the large<br />\nenrollments within these courses, and the unavailability of professors.<br />\nUndergraduates soon visualize graduate research as a parasitical<br />\ncompetitor for university resources that steadily eats away the<br />\npossible benefits of Hopkins' undergraduate education.<br />\nPriorities have been set: the undergraduate is dispensible. Our<br />\neducation continues to be sacrificed to the interests of graduate<br />\nresearch. To correct this imbalance of emphasis, we demand a shift in<br />\npriorities. After 95 years, the time has come for Hopkins to finally<br />\nmake a commitment to undergraduate education.<br />\nSUMMARY OF PROPOSALS<br />\n1) Rapid changes can best be made within the present framework.<br />\n2) Each department shall offer a number of courses per semester<br />\nequal to the number of full-time faculty in the department.<br />\n3) One-third of the faculty shall offer seminars every semester.<br />\nEach faculty member shall teach one seminar every third semester.<br />\na) Seminar size shall not exceed 15 students<br />\nb) Any students may sign up, but departmental majors shall be<br /><br />\ngiven first consideration.<br />\n4) In hiring and promotion of faculty, teaching capability shall<br />\nreceive equal recognition with the other primary criteria, research<br />\nand publication.<br />\n5) Faculty shall submit course descriptions with preferred class time<br />\nto the Registrar, who will resolve conflicts in the interests of students.<br />\n6) Courses not taught for two consecutive years shall be dropped<br />\nfrom the catalogue. The catalogue shall also list when courses will be<br />\ntaught (the semester).<br />\n7) The Social Relations Department shall offer an undergraduate<br />\nmajor.<br />\n8) \u2022 Sabbatical policy must be regulated to avoid multiple<br />\ndepartmental vacancies and repeated leaves.<br />\n9) Independent study is not a panacea for all undergraduate<br />\nproblems. It is only one ingredient of a quality education.<br />\nCONCLUSION<br />\npresented to correct only the most glaring<br />\nwere<br />\nproposals<br />\nThese nine<br />\neducation. As President<br />\nundergraduate<br />\ndeficiencies of Hopkins<br />\nGordon told the Hearings Committee, \"the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences can do a substantially better job than is now done.\" Our<br />\nsolutions are an essential first step in the process of upgrading the<br />\nquality of undergraduate education at Hopkins. These solutions can<br />\nand should be implemented at once.
