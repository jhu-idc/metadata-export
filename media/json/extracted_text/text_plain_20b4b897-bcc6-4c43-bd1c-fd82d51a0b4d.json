Discredits Both Armament<br />\nand Disarmament as Peace<br />\nPreservers<br />\n<br />\nDiscrediting both armament<br />\nand disarmament as methods for<br />\npreserving peace, Jr. Norman<br />\nThomas, executive head, of the<br />\nLeague for Industrial Democracy<br />\nand former editor of the World<br />\nTomorrow, declared in his address<br />\nat the Assembly last Thursday<br />\nthat the two main causes of war<br />\nare the economic dependence of<br />\none nation upon another, and the<br />\nexistence in every country of a<br />\nnational spirit which consists<br />\nmainly of hostility for other nations. Mr. Thomas has made an<br />\nexhaustive study of the problems<br />\nassociated with world peace and<br />\nis a frequent lecturer at colleges<br />\nand public meetings -on the subject.<br />\nArmament Not War Preventative<br />\n<br />\nis not a 'peace<br />\nguard,\" the speaker said, \"the<br />\nWorld War proved that. European powers were as men sitting<br />\naround a table playing poker, with<br />\nall of them armed to the limit.<br />\nPreparing for war is not a sure<br />\nway of preserving peace\u2014too<br />\noften we get what we prepare for.<br />\n\"On the other hand, disarmament is an equally inadequate<br />\nmethod for avoiding war. Disarmament is not compatible with<br />\nworld conditions. Even if every<br />\nnation would 'scrap' its navy and<br />\ndemobilize its army, peace would<br />\nbe far from assured for the progress of science has created a paradox. The improvement of the<br />\naeroplane, and discoveries in<br />\nchemistry and physics have given<br />\nnations new devices_that are convertible into war weapons. Therefore, merely to disarm will not<br />\npreserve peace, because poisonous<br />\ngases and aeroplanes are more essential to modern warfare than<br />\nlarge armies and navies.<br />\n\"Armament<br />\n<br />\nWar Can't Be Outlawed<br />\n<br />\nThe contention that war could<br />\nbe outlawed is also fallacious. It<br />\nis usually considered legal to do<br />\nwhat we can do and ethics is seldom a factor in deciding what we<br />\ncan do. For example, in the<br />\nUnited States many things are<br />\ndone that can hardly be construed<br />\nas in accordance with either the<br />\nSpirit or the letter of the Eighteenth Amendment. The argument<br />\nthat duelling was abolished by legislation and that war could be<br />\nabolished in the same way is incorrect. Duelling died because<br />\nsober public opinion disparaged<br />\nit. The idea of fighting to avenge<br />\na petty insult lost its popularity.<br />\nWars are seldom fought over<br />\nPoints of honor. The causes of<br />\nmodern wars can almost invariably be connected with economic<br />\nproblems, such as the control of<br />\noil, iron or coal.\"<br />\nMr. Thomas then explained that<br />\npractically every nation is dependent on other nations for some necessities of life. Japan, for instance,. is overpopulated and for<br />\nits own benefit has the tendency<br />\nto control Korea. Every other<br />\ngreat power, even the United<br />\nStates, has at some time displayed<br />\nthe same tendency.

The<br />\nraw material, in the form of high and preparatory school graduates, is<br />\ngathered rather than selected, is thrown into the maChine ; the wheels<br />\nare turned and a stereotyped, heterogeneous finished product is shipped<br />\nout into the world. Now and then the machine slips and a few \"irregulars\" appear but, for the most part, the products of the Maine plant<br />\nand the Texas plant are identical.<br />\nThe causes leading to this situation seem to us to be obvious. Success and failure in the American University are determined solely by<br />\nmarks. A man takes a text-book, learns what someone else has to say on<br />\na subject, writes this opinion on an examination paper and graduates<br />\nwith honors without having had an idea of his own.

Discredits Both Armament<br />\nand Disarmament as Peace<br />\nPreservers<br /><br />\nDiscrediting both armament<br />\nand disarmament as methods for<br />\npreserving peace, Jr. Norman<br />\nThomas, executive head, of the<br />\nLeague for Industrial Democracy<br />\nand former editor of the World<br />\nTomorrow, declared in his address<br />\nat the Assembly last Thursday<br />\nthat the two main causes of war<br />\nare the economic dependence of<br />\none nation upon another, and the<br />\nexistence in every country of a<br />\nnational spirit which consists<br />\nmainly of hostility for other nations. Mr. Thomas has made an<br />\nexhaustive study of the problems<br />\nassociated with world peace and<br />\nis a frequent lecturer at colleges<br />\nand public meetings -on the subject.<br />\nArmament Not War Preventative<br /><br />\nis not a 'peace<br />\nguard,\" the speaker said, \"the<br />\nWorld War proved that. European powers were as men sitting<br />\naround a table playing poker, with<br />\nall of them armed to the limit.<br />\nPreparing for war is not a sure<br />\nway of preserving peace\u2014too<br />\noften we get what we prepare for.<br />\n\"On the other hand, disarmament is an equally inadequate<br />\nmethod for avoiding war. Disarmament is not compatible with<br />\nworld conditions. Even if every<br />\nnation would 'scrap' its navy and<br />\ndemobilize its army, peace would<br />\nbe far from assured for the progress of science has created a paradox. The improvement of the<br />\naeroplane, and discoveries in<br />\nchemistry and physics have given<br />\nnations new devices_that are convertible into war weapons. Therefore, merely to disarm will not<br />\npreserve peace, because poisonous<br />\ngases and aeroplanes are more essential to modern warfare than<br />\nlarge armies and navies.<br />\n\"Armament<br /><br />\nWar Can't Be Outlawed<br /><br />\nThe contention that war could<br />\nbe outlawed is also fallacious. It<br />\nis usually considered legal to do<br />\nwhat we can do and ethics is seldom a factor in deciding what we<br />\ncan do. For example, in the<br />\nUnited States many things are<br />\ndone that can hardly be construed<br />\nas in accordance with either the<br />\nSpirit or the letter of the Eighteenth Amendment. The argument<br />\nthat duelling was abolished by legislation and that war could be<br />\nabolished in the same way is incorrect. Duelling died because<br />\nsober public opinion disparaged<br />\nit. The idea of fighting to avenge<br />\na petty insult lost its popularity.<br />\nWars are seldom fought over<br />\nPoints of honor.
