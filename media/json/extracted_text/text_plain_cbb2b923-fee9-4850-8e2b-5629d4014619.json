Hiss said for \"some<br />\nof them yes,\" but \"a large<br />\n',umber paid no attention to the<br />\ntempest.\" The hysteria created<br />\nwas fed by McCarthy according<br />\n<br />\nto Hiss. And the hysteria affected attititudes towards policy<br />\nand made it hard to pick a jury<br />\nwithout prejudice to communism, commented Hiss.<br />\nThe next question of the session asked Hiss what kinds of<br />\nelements that the 1980's would<br />\nmake him fear a reprise of the<br />\n1950's. Hiss stated that both<br />\ncivil rights and liberties had<br />\n\"suffered defeats in the Reagan<br />\nadministration.\" Hiss gave no<br />\nspecific instances, but described what he called a \"very<br />\ngeneral thing in the air.\" He<br />\nspoke of Reagan dismantling<br />\nthe \"regard for the welfare of<br />\nthose less fortunate than we.\"<br />\nHiss also discussed the<br />\nforeign policy of invading<br />\nGrenada and the situation in<br />\nNicaragua \"where the practical<br />\nand inevitable tendency is to be<br />\nless than charitable to opposi-<br />\n<br />\ntion.\" He sees the \"growing acceptance of hostility to<br />\ncriticism\" as a \"potential<br />\ndanger.\"<br />\nHiss then turned to the concept of the nation responding to<br />\npublic agitation. He fears the<br />\npublic has become apathetic.<br />\nOnly \"when widespread demand of liberties and rights\" is<br />\npresent will the nation still respond to it.<br />\nHiss was also asked about his<br />\nattitude toward the Supreme<br />\nCourt and whether it had<br />\nchanged pending its recent<br />\nrefusal to hear him. He stated<br />\nthat he \"didn't expect much action from the Supreme Court.\"<br />\nHe saw the court failure to be<br />\nthat of \"individuals in the<br />\nlower courts.\" He has not,<br />\nhowever, changed his view.

The cost<br />\nfor the 1985-6 academic year of<br />\nthese plans are $1890 and<br />\n$1690.<br />\nThe casual meal rates, posted<br />\nat the Terrace Room's entrance, are $2.50 for breakfast,<br />\n$3.50 for lunch or brunch, and<br />\n$4.50 for dinner. The average<br />\nmeal costs $3.60.<br />\nAn article in the November 1<br />\nNews-Letter showed that<br />\nstudents who subscribe to meal<br />\nplans must eat between 81.1<br />\nand 106.9 percent of their meals<br />\nto save money.<br />\nMiller- said, \"When we<br />\ncalculate the cost to the student,<br />\nwe calculate a missed meal factor of the student.

He said that three of<br />\nthese are the cost of food, the<br />\npayments of employees'<br />\nsalaries, and the cost of<br />\nutilities.<br />\nThe fourth, said Krueger, is<br />\n\"debt service.\" He explained<br />\nthat the Terrace Room cost between $8 million and $9 million<br />\nto build, saying that Auxiliary<br />\nEnterprises, which borrowed<br />\nmoney from the Maryland<br />\nHigher Education Department<br />\nto build the cafeteria, expects to<br />\neliminate its current debt by<br />\n<br />\n1993 or 1994.<br />\nAccording to Kupritz,\"Dean<br />\nKrueger insists that any profits<br />\nthe university gains from providing a food service go directly back to the food service.\"<br />\nKrueger said, -Auxiliary<br />\nEnterprises have to operate<br />\nalmost autonomously from the<br />\nrest of the university's finances.<br />\nAlong those lines, fees from<br />\nusers should pay for the cost of<br />\noperating the facilities.\"<br />\n\"We don't v. ant to put the<br />\nburden on the \"udents now,\"<br />\nhe continued. \",ks years go by,<br />\ndebt services Jecrease each<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nKupritz commented on the<br />\ndebt, saying \"That brings up an<br />\ninteresting question in my<br />\nmind. If they're going to be<br />\npaying off this $9 million debt<br />\nor parts thereof, then there<br />\nmust be a large gap between the<br />\nprice that students pay and the<br />\nprice that the university pays<br />\nthe food service, because the only costs the university has other<br />\nthan those directly to the food<br />\nservice are utilities and the cost<br />\nof the cafeteria.\"<br />\n\"It strikes me that at the time<br />\nthe debt is paid off,\" said<br />\nKupritz, \"the university will<br />\nnot be inclined to reduce the<br />\nrates of the board plan<br />\nsignificantly. It is unreasonable<br />\nfor the students over the next<br />\neight years to be carrying the<br />\ncost of the cafeteria.\"<br />\nKupritz, though, sees little<br />\nchance that the pricing policies<br />\ncan be changed soon. \"It's<br />\nsomething that should have<br />\nbeen thought out in advance,\"<br />\nhe said. \"There should be an<br />\nimmediate effort to do some<br />\nlong term planning that hasn't<br />\nbeen done before.

And such<br />\nthoughts have brought us to make what<br />\nsome will no doubt view as a rash suggestion: abolish the SAC Seals.<br />\nFor the uninitiated, the Seals are<br />\nawards given by the Student Activities<br />\nCommission to graduating seniors who<br />\nhave contributed to extracurricular activities. In theory, the idea is fine. Many<br />\nstudents devote a lot of time to student<br />\nclubs or publications or the student<br />\ngovernment. While their colleagues are<br />\nburied on D-level all day, these people<br />\nsacrifice a lot of time and energy trying<br />\nto make Hopkins a more interesting<br />\nplace. At graduation, the argument goes,<br />\nthey ought to get a little recognition in<br />\nfront of Mommy and Daddy.<br />\nSo what's wrong with all that? Well,<br />\nunfortunately, it's never that simple.<br />\nAlmost every year, some sort of a ruckus<br />\ndevelops over who should\u2014and who<br />\nshouldn't\u2014get a Seal. It all gets<br />\nremarkably personal: \"So-and-so never<br />\ndid a thing;\" \"He worked his rear off<br />\nfor us, and you don't want to give him<br />\na Seal just because you don't like him;\"<br />\netc. In the end, both the SAC and the<br />\nStudent Council, which must approve<br />\nthe list of recipients, often look quite silly. Two years ago, the brouhaha became<br />\nso intense, in fact, that several students<br />\nwere within a hair's-breadth of asking<br />\nthat their names be removed from the<br />\nlist, and\u2014at a public meeting\u2014one<br />\nCouncil member used a four-letter-word<br />\ntowards another. All of this means that<br />\n<br />\njust as graduation is approaching (a time<br />\nwhen seniors would feel a certain esprit<br />\nde corps, one hopes)a lot of unnecessary<br />\nhostility is created.<br />\nAnd when you get right down to it,<br />\nthere really aren't very many good<br />\narguments in favor of the Seals. Surely<br />\nnobody dedicates four years to an extracurricular activity just so he can stand<br />\nup and receive an award at graduation;<br />\nhe does it because he enjoys it. Indeed,<br />\nwe've always suspected that many of the<br />\nSeals' defenders don't give a hoot about<br />\nshowing off at commencement. They're<br />\njust appalled at the idea of losing such<br />\nfine resume fodder.<br />\nAdmittedly the process of picking Seal<br />\nrecipients went fairly smoothly last year.<br />\nBut this was accomplished mainly by an<br />\ninteresting legislative sleight of hand<br />\nwhich barred the SAC General Assembly<br />\nand the Student Council from raising objections to specific members of the list<br />\nprepared by the SAC Executive Board.<br />\nThat meant both the SAC and the Council had to pass the list or send the whole<br />\nthing back to the Board, and with<br />\ngraduation fast approaching they didn't<br />\nhave much of a choice. It isn't really<br />\nmuch of a system, though, in that it concentrates complete power in the hands of<br />\nthe Board. (It also remains to be explained<br />\nhow the Board can tell its two superior<br />\norganizations what to do.)<br />\nSimply glossing over the problem last<br />\nyear was by no means a long-term solution. Sooner or later, the Seals will once<br />\nagain cause as much animosity as they<br />\nused to. A little recognition for students<br />\nwho have worked hard might be nice,<br />\nbut it isn't worth the hassle of the Seals.<br />\n<br />\nA Second WJHU<br />\nDifficult problems rarely present truly satisfying solutions. Usually the choice<br />\nis between the lesser of two evils. But in<br />\nthe last couple weeks, a remarkably<br />\nsimple\u2014yet adequate\u2014answer to the<br />\nquestion of a student radio station at<br />\nHopkins has been proposed: a second<br />\nWJHU.<br />\n\\ The idea, quite simply, is to create a<br />\nnew 10-watt station when WJHU goes<br />\nto 25,000 watts sometime next spring,<br />\nThe smaller station would continue to be<br />\nstudent-run and student-staffed. We<br />\nrealize, of course, it couldn't actually<br />\nhave WJHU as its call letters; we're<br />\nsimply calling it that for lack of a better<br />\nname. The minor student involvement<br />\nslated for the 25,000-watt WJHU would<br />\ncertainly still be welcome, but the smaller<br />\nstation would allow students interested<br />\nin actually running a station to do so.<br />\nThe plan's feasibility remains to be examined closely, but it is an interesting<br />\nidea. Rejecting it out of hand, as the administration appears to have done, is a<br />\nmistake.<br />\nThe idea has come from several current WJHU staff members. They correctly point out that student activity at<br />\nthe 25,000-watt station will be virtually<br />\n<br />\nnil, administration claims to the contrary<br />\nnotwithstanding. The facts are that only three part-time positions will be reserved<br />\nfor students, and that students will have<br />\nto compete with professionals for other<br />\njobs. That means, in effect, that students<br />\nwill be eliminated from any meaningful<br />\nrole at WJHU after the power increase.<br />\nWhether or not such complete professional control is a good idea is a red herring now, but the students who currently run WJHU\u2014especially the<br />\nunderclassmen\u2014are understandably<br />\nupset.<br />\nB.J. Norris, vice president for cornmunications and public affairs and the<br />\nperson ultimately responsible for<br />\nWJHU, says the administration's<br />\nresponse to the plea for a second station<br />\nis that the university is going to have only<br />\none radio station. Why? Norris doesn't<br />\nreally say. There simply is going to be<br />\none station and one station only, she<br />\ninsists.<br />\nWe're not fully endorsing the idea of<br />\na second Hopkins radio station. All sorts<br />\nof problems need to be investigated. But<br />\ninstead of shooting down an innovative<br />\nproposal, the administration ought to be<br />\nwilling to consider it.<br />\n<br />\nIt was 10:43\u2014only 7 minutes<br />\nbefore his first (and last) class,<br />\nHistory of Greek Art and its<br />\nRamifications Upon Polish<br />\nSexuality, would be over.

Bill<br />\nlooked at the door, and read<br />\nthe attached sign (with his lips<br />\nmoving), \"T-E-A-C-H-I-N-G<br />\nA-S-S-I-S-T-A-N-T-S.\"<br />\nA perplexed look came over<br />\nBill's face, and then, ever so<br />\ncautiously, he opened the door.<br />\nSix TA's inside the room slowly turned to look at him.

Although we<br />\nstill have a few weak spots in<br />\nour analysis, After Hours is a<br />\nremarkable take-off. Dunne<br />\nstarts off by unintentionally<br />\nkilling Roseanna Arquette(The<br />\nWicked Witch of the East). The<br />\nthree women that Dunne meets<br />\nall resemble the character of the<br />\nWicked Witch of the West.

There is an incredible fire motif in After<br />\nHours as there was in The<br />\nWizard of Oz. One of the<br />\nwomen even tries to burn paper<br />\nmache off of Dunne's skin. He<br />\nis imprisoned in paper mache<br />\narmor and cannot move, like<br />\nthe rusted'tin man. Another<br />\nmotif that is common to both<br />\nmovies is that of sleep. Roseanna Arquette overdoses on pills<br />\nwhile Dunne, exhausted, staggers through SoHo. In The<br />\nWizard of Oz, the Wicked<br />\nWitch attempts to kill Dorothy<br />\nand her friends by putting them<br />\nto sleep in a field of poppies.<br />\nThe fact that Brett<br />\ncharacterizes After Hours as<br />\n\".just a bunch of events lacking<br />\nsomething which can serve to<br />\ntie it all together\" says much<br />\nfor the genius of Scorsese, who<br />\nhas succeeded in doing<br />\n<br />\nclear.

But Wolman's association<br />\nwith the university goes back<br />\nlong before there was a<br />\nWolman Hall, or for that matter, a Homewood campus.<br />\nAfter graduating from<br />\nHopkins in 1913 with a B.A. in<br />\nnatural science, Wolman was<br />\nprepared for medical school.<br />\nHis parents, however, already<br />\nwith an elder son headed<br />\ntowards the medical profession,<br />\ntold him that he was to become<br />\nan engineer instead. When asked<br />\nyears later if he harbored<br />\nthoughts of rebellion at this imposition by his parents,<br />\nWolman replied that he hadn't<br />\nuntil the very moment of the<br />\nquestion! So, Wolman went on,<br />\nin 1915, to graduate in a group<br />\nof four students as a member of<br />\nthe first class of the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Engineering.<br />\nThroughout the years since<br />\nthen, Wolman has served locally, nationally, and even internationally in many areas relating<br />\nto his specialty\u2014sanitary<br />\nengineering. Along with his<br />\ncommission as \"Admiral of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay\" by the governor of Maryland for his initial<br />\nchairmanship of the Maryland<br />\nState Planning Commission<br />\nand the dedication of the<br />\nBaltimore Public Works<br />\n<br />\nMuseum as \"The Liveable City:<br />\nDr. Abel Wolman and the Contiuing Work of the Engineer.\"<br />\nAt the same time, he has been<br />\na prized lecturer at some of the<br />\nmost distinguished universities<br />\nin the country: Johns Hopkins,<br />\nHarvard, Princeton, the<br />\nUniversity of Chicago, and the<br />\nUniversity of Southern California among others. At one time<br />\nin 1926, he commuted weekly<br />\nbetween Hopkins and Harvard<br />\nto give lectures at both institutions. Looking back on this,<br />\nWolman finds it hard to believe<br />\nhe ever did something like that,<br />\nremembering there was no air<br />\ntravel back then; the fastest<br />\nmeans was the midnight train<br />\nfrom Boston to Baltimore.<br />\nFrom 1937 to 1962, Wolman<br />\nheld a permanent position at<br />\nHopkins as the chairman of<br />\nsanitary engineering both at the<br />\nSchool of Engineering and the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth. He required his<br />\nstudents at the Homewood<br />\ncampus to take courses such as<br />\nepidemiology and physiology in<br />\nthe Medical School, while he<br />\nhad his students there come and<br />\nattend lectures at Homewood.<br />\nSuch interaction between campuses he sees as good and still<br />\nendorses today. One course<br />\nwhich Wolman taught himself<br />\nthroughout his many years here<br />\nwas entitled, \"Legal and Social<br />\nImplications of Engineering,\"<br />\nfor, as he points out, an<br />\nengineer's work directly affects<br />\nthe public, especially on the<br />\ntopic of sanitary engineering,<br />\nHe was pleasantly surprised<br />\nwith the recent addition of a<br />\ncourse entitled \"Ethics\" to<br />\n-the chemical engineering<br />\n<br />\ncurriculum.<br />\nThe effects of Wolman's<br />\nwork can be seen throughout<br />\nthe world, but they can be<br />\nespecially well noticed right<br />\nhere in Baltimore. As an advisor to the mayor of Baltimore<br />\nfor more than forty years on<br />\nwater resources, as a member<br />\nof various boards and commissions concerning Baltimore's<br />\npublic works, and as a consulting engineer, Wolman has<br />\nbeen instrumental in the<br />\ndevelopment of Baltimore's<br />\nrenowned water supply system<br />\nand in the restoration of the<br />\nonce filthy harbor. As a young<br />\nman growing up in Baltimore,<br />\nWolman remembers that you<br />\ncould tell you were nearing the<br />\ncity when coming up the<br />\nChesapeake by the stench of the<br />\nharbor, sometimes sensed five<br />\nmiles away.<br />\nWhen Wolman presented an<br />\nidea of cleaning up the harbor<br />\nto a mayor of Baltimore many<br />\nyears ago, a plan he envisioned<br />\nfrom the sight of the harbor in<br />\nStockholm, Sweden, it received<br />\nan enthusiastic reponse. Cornmenting on why things were<br />\nable to improve in Baltimore,<br />\nWolman says that the city has<br />\nbeen blessed with many fine<br />\nmayors over the past few<br />\ndecades who have worked with<br />\nand listened to many dedicated<br />\nmen to bring about the beauty,<br />\ncleanliness, and health, which<br />\ngood water resources management provides. An engineer can<br />\nhave great plans, but without<br />\nthe poitician to sell them to,<br />\nthey will never be realized. Fortunately, Baltimore has had<br />\nboth public officials with<br />\nforesight and engineers with<br />\n<br />\nGreystOrie Studios<br />\n<br />\nHe couldn't get enough of JHU\u2014Abel Wolman in 1940.<br />\n<br />\nideas who have coordinated<br />\ntheir efforts through the years.<br />\nWhen asked for any words of<br />\nwisdom gleaned throughout his<br />\nlife, Wolman responded with a<br />\nreply given by Mr. Hilton (of<br />\nhotel fame) to a similar question. \"Always remember to put<br />\nthe shower curtain inside the<br />\ntub,' and its consequent corrollary, \"Water will penetrate<br />\nanything.\" Finally though, he<br />\n<br />\nstated, \"Everything in my<br />\nlifetime has turned out independent of design or plan.\" He<br />\nsaid that some people were<br />\nlucky and had their entire<br />\nfuture mapped out, but others<br />\ndo not and they should not feel<br />\nthat a plan is necessary for success.

O'Shea's bumblings<br />\nand adept slapstick physical<br />\nhumor quite easily steal the<br />\nshow.<br />\nThe supporting performances of Pauline Flanagan, as<br />\nEvelyn's nosy landlady, and<br />\nScott LaFeber as Constable<br />\nHawkins, are also quite<br />\nexcellent.<br />\nPerhaps the real star of this<br />\nshow, however, is the production itself. The revolving set is<br />\namazingly ingenious and is probably one of the most elaborate<br />\nto be seen in Baltimore in a<br />\nwhile. In any mystery there<br />\nmust be an enormous attention<br />\nto detail and Corpse! does not<br />\nneglect a thing. For example,<br />\nwhen Evelyn makes dinner,<br />\nsmoke comes out the chimney.<br />\nAnd quite a few times you<br />\nwould swear that both Rupert<br />\nand Evelyn were on the stage at<br />\nthe same time although, of<br />\ncourse, that's impossible.<br />\nCorpse!is quite entertaining,<br />\nif not perhaps extremely<br />\noriginal or \"thrilling,\" and its<br />\nplot, though complicated, is<br />\nvery convincingly untangled.<br />\nThe ticket prices for the<br />\nMechanic production, which<br />\nruns through December 8,<br />\nrange from $25 to $17.50 and<br />\nhalf-price student rush tickets<br />\nare available at the box office<br />\nan hour to a half-hour before<br />\nshowtime.

The lingering<br />\nresonance of Winters' soprano<br />\nsax in this cavernous stone<br />\nbuilding created an ambience<br />\nand an image of far away places<br />\nthat lingered resonantly in my<br />\nhead long after the concert was<br />\nover. The reverberation was<br />\nsuch that a note would be<br />\nplayed, held over until reached<br />\nfull maturity, then left to<br />\nwander about the room on its<br />\nown as another took its place.<br />\nIt was not entirely by accident,<br />\nthqugh, that this setting was<br />\nchosen. Two months ago, Paul<br />\n'Winter released his latest<br />\nalbum, Canyon. It was recorded, in part, at the Cathedral of<br />\nSt. John the Divine(the largest<br />\ncathedral in the world, New<br />\nYork City)earlier this year, and<br />\nin the Grand Canyon, during a<br />\nraft trip down the Colorado<br />\nRiver in 1980. For the most<br />\npart, Friday's concert tried to<br />\ncapture the same quality and atmosphere achieved on this<br />\nalbum.<br />\nThe taped sounds and the<br />\nsinging of Susan Osborne<br />\n(whose remarkable voice<br />\n<br />\nbenefited from the resonant<br />\nchamber as much as any of the<br />\ninstruments) were also elements<br />\nfrom previous albums, the<br />\nformer, in fact, being a<br />\ntrademark of Paul Winters'<br />\nmusic. The tapes were played<br />\nthree or four times during the<br />\nconcert, sometimes serving as<br />\nthe foundation for a piece,<br />\nother times providing an added dimension to a previously<br />\nconceived song. In each instance, though, whether the<br />\ntape was of a wolf howling or<br />\na whale singing, the ethereal<br />\nquality of the instruments<br />\nplayed in this cathedral was<br />\nnearly indistinguishable from<br />\nthat of the animal voices. A<br />\nhaunting, pleading cry of the<br />\nwhales was transformed into a<br />\nmournful melody on the saxaphone, with no discernible<br />\ntransition. The wolf cries, too,<br />\nwere taken up by the French<br />\nhorn, the sax, and (at Paul's request) the audience.<br />\nThis mingling of animal and<br />\nhuman songs represents, more<br />\nthan anything else, perhaps,<br />\nwhat Paul Winter has been trying to achieve with his music<br />\nfor the past fifteen years or so.<br />\nWith his new Paul Winter Consort (two of the original<br />\nmembers, Robert Towner and<br />\nColin Walcott, went on to form<br />\nthe band Oregon) and the<br />\nrecord label he founded in<br />\n1980, Living Music Records,<br />\nPaul Winter has attempted not<br />\nonly to capture nature in music,<br />\nbut to do it in a simple way, one<br />\nwhich most people can appreciate and understand. In<br />\nachieving this, he established<br />\nthe increasingly popular genre<br />\nof music known as \"environmental\" or \"new age\"<br />\nmusic. Recording and performing in such places as the Grand<br />\nCanyon and St. John's<br />\nCathedral is a perfect example<br />\nof a simple concept which<br />\n<br />\nenhances the natural, atmospheric ambience of his<br />\nmusic, even to the extent where<br />\nit is an integral part of that<br />\nmusic. Indeed, his concert Friday would have been<br />\ndramatically different if it had<br />\nbeen performed just about<br />\nanywhere else in Baltimore,<br />\neven in the Civic Center; the<br />\nacoustics were that significant.<br />\nOf course, I couldn't understand a word he said, but I certainly didn't go to the concert<br />\nto hear him speak.<br />\nAt present, the Paul Winter<br />\nConsort consists of four musicians, excluding Winter. John<br />\nClark, the French horn; and<br />\nGlenn Velez, percussion. Susan<br />\nOsborne, their guest artist on<br />\nFriday is a reknowned alto who<br />\nhad contributed to one previous<br />\nalbum by Winter. Each instrument, in the echoing cavity of<br />\nthe Cathedral, took on a quality that was almost unrecognizable. In addition to this,<br />\nsome of the performers (Osborne, Velez, and Winter)<br />\nquietly made their way to the<br />\nrear of the Cathedral, at different points in the concert,<br />\nthen slowly walked down the<br />\ncentral aisle, playing solo.<br />\nWhen this happened, it was difficult to discern, at first, where<br />\nthe sound was coming from.<br />\nHaving chosen a seat next to<br />\nthe mixing boards (and other<br />\ncontrol equipment), my first<br />\nreaction was to glance at the<br />\ntape recorder to see if it was<br />\nmoving. Needless to say, the instruments were unamplified or<br />\nthese occasions(they were miked up front), but the difference<br />\nin volume was hardly noticeable (certainly it was made up<br />\nfor by the more complete<br />\ndispersion of the sound.)<br />\nAs far as I could tell, Velez<br />\nprimarily played only one instrument, though it often<br />\nContinued on Page 12<br />\n<br />\n\f12/NOVEMBER 22, 1985<br />\n<br />\nMUSIC:<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar!<br />\n<br />\nMOVIES:<br />\nSenior Class Film Series:<br />\nRacing with the Moon.

It is<br />\ndescribed in the credits of Canyon as a \"desert drum...a<br />\nNorth African frame drum with<br />\nsnares, played with fingers.\" It<br />\nresembles an oversized tamborine (without jingles), supported and held by a pair of intersecting rods on one side. The<br />\nsounds which emanated from<br />\nthis instrument ranged from<br />\nsometing that was more li!-e a<br />\ncello than the 'cello, produced<br />\nby slowly rubbing the thumb<br />\nalong the outer edge of the<br />\nface, to a buzzing, rattling<br />\nsound, which consistently gave<br />\nthe impression that it, or<br />\nsomething else, was about to<br />\nfall apart. Velez also made use<br />\nof the rim, striking it with his<br />\nhand for a more conventional<br />\nknocking sound, used to punctuate the rhythmic rattling. The<br />\nother instrument Velez used<br />\nwas the triangle, which he<br />\nplayed by striking it very rapidly and establishing a fast-paced<br />\nrhythm, contrasting nicely with<br />\nthe drum. In general, the drum<br />\nwas used in the more lively<br />\npieces, and only occasionally<br />\nduring the slow, drifting<br />\nmelodies of the sax, horn, or<br />\n'cello.<br />\nEugene Friesen played the<br />\n'cello with great precision, giving it very little vibrato. It's<br />\nlong, deep notes, clear and unwavering, resembled those of a<br />\nsynthesizer; its high notes,<br />\nequally,clear. and steady, were<br />\nnot unlike those of the sax. It<br />\n<br />\nsharing in, the melodic development. But Paul Winter's music<br />\nis geared more toward the<br />\nlingering, plaintive cries of the<br />\nwind instruments, and for this<br />\nthe organ is much better suited.<br />\nThe Cathedral organ was not in<br />\nthe least bit obstrusive (church<br />\norgans always tend to be so<br />\noverpowering), but rather<br />\nseemed to be an integral-part of<br />\nthe music. I wouldn't be very<br />\nmuch surprised if Winters' current concert tour is to raise<br />\nmoney to build a pipe organ in<br />\nthe Grand Canyon.<br />\nSusan Osborne added a unique element to the concedrt<br />\nwith her very versatile voice.

My new theory<br />\nis that she was only seriously<br />\ninjured.<br />\n<br />\nThis is my theory, a few<br />\nmonths after Crown Publishers<br />\nreleased Jean M. Auel's novel<br />\nThe Clan of the Cave Bear,<br />\nMrs. Auel found herself in a<br />\nvery bad car crash, and much<br />\nto the dismay of the publishers<br />\nshe died. Crown kept the whole<br />\nmessy business under wraps but<br />\nafter the novel went on the<br />\nbecome a big hit, people began<br />\nscreaming \"Movie! Merchandise!! Sequel!!!\" and the<br />\nCrown execs began screaming.<br />\nThis went on for some time<br />\n(and became quite noisy) until<br />\none day a bright young lad in<br />\nthe PR department had an<br />\nidea\u2014it wasn't a very good idea<br />\nbut it would work. What they<br />\ndid (at least in my theory) was<br />\nto sign on some cheap, two bit<br />\nromance writer who cranked<br />\nout a sequel(The Valley of the<br />\nHorses) in a matter of days.<br />\nThe trashy sequel bears about<br />\nas much resemblance to the<br />\noriginal as Easyrider does to<br />\nRoad and Track, yet it seems<br />\nCrown knows what people<br />\nwant because the sequel went<br />\non to outsell the first book.<br />\nAnd now, Crown has released<br />\nthe much awaited third book of<br />\nJean M. Auel's \"Earth's<br />\nChildren\" series, The Mammoth Hunters.<br />\nFor all those who don't<br />\nknow, the Earth's Children<br />\nseries takes place in prehistoric<br />\n<br />\nEurope during the ice age<br />\n(about 35,000 to 25,000 years<br />\nago). It is the story of a young<br />\ngirl named Ayla who loses her<br />\npeople in an earthquake and as<br />\na result, she is taken in and raised<br />\nby a people who call themselves<br />\n\"the clan of the cave bear\".<br />\nThe clan, it turns out, are an example of divergent evolution,<br />\nthey are similar in some ways to<br />\nAyla's people yet very different<br />\nin others. The second book<br />\nconcerns itself mainly with<br />\nwhat happens to Ayla(now age<br />\n17) when she is kicked out of<br />\nthe clan, and finally comes face<br />\nto face(hmm)with a nice man<br />\nof her own species named Jondalar (read: Lance). The rest of<br />\nthe plot is squeezed in between<br />\na multitude of overwritten sex<br />\nscenes.<br />\nThe third book begins with<br />\nAyla and Jondalar meeting<br />\nhumans known as the Mamutoi<br />\n(The Mammoth Hunters), and<br />\nfrom there the novel is generally<br />\na story about how the Mamutoi<br />\n(numbering about 27)live, their<br />\ncustoms and beliefs. But in particular the story is about the<br />\nrelationship between Ayla, Jondalar, and Ranec, a Mamutoi<br />\nman who competes with Jondalar for Ayla affections.<br />\nThe amount of research that<br />\nwent into writing this book is<br />\nobvious, Mrs. Auel manages to<br />\nshow us in an interesting and<br />\nentertaining way, information<br />\nwhich until now could only be<br />\nfound in the driest of anthropological texts. It is<br />\nbecause of this almost<br />\nethnographic information that<br />\n<br />\none finds the more fantastic<br />\nelements of the story tolerable.<br />\nOn one level, The Mammoth<br />\nHunters can be viewed as a case<br />\nstudy in primitive group<br />\ndynamics, while on another it<br />\nis a story about people and their<br />\nfeelings. Viewed either way this<br />\nbook is much better than the<br />\none before and a lot of the ideas<br />\nwhich made the first noteworthy<br />\nare present. My biggest complaint would have to be that a<br />\nbit of the \"Boy mates Girl\"<br />\nconcept of love is carried over<br />\nfrom the second book. It seems<br />\nthat at some points in the story<br />\nMrs. Auel tends to forget that<br />\nlove is more a matter of<br />\nchemistry than of physics.<br />\nAfter reading this book, I<br />\nhave been forced to modify my<br />\nthe3ry concerning Mrs. Auel's<br />\nuntimely death. My new theory<br />\nis that she was only seriously injured, or perhaps lapsed into a<br />\ncoma for a few years as a result<br />\nof her smash up. I take The<br />\nMammoth Hunters to be a<br />\nstrong sign of her recovery and<br />\nhope that with the next book in<br />\nher series she is able to regain<br />\nthat which made her first work<br />\na piece of art. It would be a pity if instead she regressed again<br />\ninto writing semi-pornographic<br />\ntrash in order to sell more<br />\ncopies to middle aged housewives.<br />\n<br />\nEditor's Note: There is a film<br />\nbased on the first two books<br />\ncoming out, starring Daryl<br />\nHannah, screenplay by John<br />\nSay/es.<br />\n<br />\nBaldwin: Too Much Fury, Too Little Perce<br />\nEvidence of Things Not Seen<br />\nexamines the state of race relations in America.

The Swallowing<br />\nCenter, the only one of its kind,<br />\nwas started almost five years<br />\nago by the current director, Dr.<br />\nMartin Donner, and Dr. James<br />\nBosma, then at the National Institutes of Health. Before the<br />\nexistence of the Swallowing<br />\nCenter, many doctors, including those at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, had been<br />\nswallowing<br />\nresearching<br />\ndisorders independently. Dr.<br />\nDonner and Dr. Bosma had<br />\nbeen in contact for many years<br />\nwhen Dr. Donner proposed the<br />\nidea for the Center.<br />\nSwallowing disorders treated<br />\nat the Center include the inability to ingest solids, the inability<br />\nto drink liquids and other problems coordinating respiration<br />\nand swallowing. Swallowing is<br />\na complicated process which<br />\nstarts at the mouth and ends at<br />\nthe opening to the stomach, requiring the function of twentysix muscles and six cranial<br />\nnerves.<br />\nPeople who have problems<br />\ningesting solid food suffer from<br />\nthe food lodging somewhere in<br />\nthe esophagus or trachea. In<br />\nthese cases, pureed food, rather<br />\nthan solid food, must be eaten<br />\n<br />\nsince pureed food requires less<br />\nmuscle power to propel it<br />\ndownward. For those unable to<br />\ndrink liquids, a fluid-rich gel<br />\nhas been developed which<br />\nallows the patient to enjoy such<br />\ncommon liquids as coffee and<br />\norange juice. Liquids are<br />\ntroublesome to some people<br />\nbecause the liquid immediately<br />\ndisperses upon swallowing,<br />\nsome of it ending up in the<br />\nlungs. The gel has more cohesion and is designed so it liquifies farther down the tract.<br />\nThe symptoms of swallowing<br />\nmay not always be so obvious.<br />\nFor example, a persistent cough<br />\nwhich resurfaces when eating or<br />\ndrinking may be an indication<br />\nthat food is sliding down the<br />\nwindpipe. Another indication<br />\nmay be when the voice suddenly changes and becomes difficult to understand when a person speaks. In fact, a person,<br />\nmay not notice the swallowing<br />\ndifficulty until a much later<br />\ndate due to voluntary and incompensation<br />\nvoluntary<br />\nabilities of the body.<br />\nVoluntary compensation includes a sometimes subconscious choice by the person<br />\nto eat slowly or to eat only<br />\npureed foods which \"go down\"<br />\neasier. Involuntary compensation includes losing some func-<br />\n<br />\ntions of the muscles which,<br />\nnevertheless, allow the person<br />\nto swallow to a lesser degree.<br />\nDepending upon the specific<br />\nproblem, delaying treatment<br />\ncan lead to progressive worsening of the condition. The<br />\ntrachea may become completely obstructed resulting in choking or massive aspiration. This<br />\nis known as decompensation.<br />\nThe body can no longer compensate because the problem<br />\nhas built up to a definitely<br />\nharmful degree.<br />\nSwallowing problems afflict<br />\nan entire range of age groups.<br />\nForty to fifty percent of all patients in nursing homes have<br />\nsome swallowing or feeding difficulties. These are mostly caused by brain damage resulting<br />\nfrom stroke and degenerating<br />\ndiseases which usually accompany old age.<br />\nThe younger segment of the<br />\npopulation may have swallowing problems arising from<br />\ndevelopmental, congenital abnormalities. Childhood diseases<br />\nsuch as cerebral palsy, could<br />\nresult in neurological problems<br />\nthroughout life. The \"sudden<br />\ndeath\" syndrome of infants has<br />\nbeen linked to swallowing<br />\ndisorders. Material from the<br />\nthe<br />\nobstructs<br />\nstomach<br />\nesophagus because of muscle<br />\n<br />\nfunction failures, thus causing<br />\nasphyxiation of the baby.<br />\nAt the present moment, Dr.<br />\nDonner comments that much<br />\nresearch is needed, especially in<br />\nthe diagnostic and rehabilitation areas. Because swallowing<br />\nproblems are so diverse and<br />\ndependent on the individual involved, there are no set rules<br />\nwhich correlate a set of symptoms with a particular cause.<br />\nSome very helpful diagnostic<br />\ntools currently in use and<br />\ndevelopment are the x-ray<br />\nmovie, electromyography, and<br />\na \"test kit.\" The test kit contains opaque substances of<br />\nvarying viscosity, elasticity and<br />\ntexture which can be picked up<br />\nby an x-ray. Thus, the problem<br />\ncan be more clearly defined by<br />\nseeing how each of these opaque substances act at different<br />\npoints in the swallowing<br />\nprocess.<br />\nSome rehabilitation techniques include assorted head<br />\nand neck positions which aid a<br />\nperson in swallowing. Lying<br />\ndown or elevating the lungs<br />\nseem to help aspiration and prevent food from descending the<br />\nwrong pipe.<br />\nDr. Donner stresses the fact<br />\nthat evaluating a swallowing<br />\ndifficulty is a multi-disciplinary<br />\napproach.

Lee<br />\nThis past Saturday, the Lady<br />\nHarriers concluded their spectacular 1985 season with a 6th<br />\nplace finish at the prestigious<br />\nNCAA division III Mid-East<br />\nChampionship Meet. Due to<br />\nthe storms weather, this race<br />\nhad minimal semblance to a<br />\ncross country meet. Instead it<br />\nwas more like an organized<br />\nmud-sliding competition.<br />\nLeaving for Allentown College, the site of this year's meet,<br />\nthe Lady Jays were well-fed, in<br />\ngood spirits, and in possession<br />\nof a full tank of gas. Unfortunately, many of the Jays lacked<br />\nthe proper clothing for what<br />\nwas to be a nasty day at the<br />\nraces.<br />\nThe reason for the team's improper attire was the result of<br />\na capricious Mother Nature.<br />\nFrom the time the Lady Jays<br />\nleft a warm and sunny<br />\nBaltimore, till the start of the<br />\nrace, the situation drastically<br />\nchanged. Temperatures dropped to near freezing and the sky<br />\nblackened, emitting an<br />\namalgamation of rain, sleet and<br />\nsnow. This tranformed the<br />\nAllentown course into one of<br />\nthe finest mud-sliding facilities<br />\non the East Coast. According<br />\nto Harrier coach Gary Green,<br />\nthe course had a stretch of<br />\n\"two miles of mud\" as \"the<br />\ngrass just disappeared.\"<br />\nWith the last minute changes<br />\nin weather, there was a shared<br />\nsentiment that this would not<br />\nbe a fun race to run. Maybe a<br />\nblast to watch, but definitely<br />\n<br />\nnot to run. Watching the runners line up for the start of the<br />\nrace, the coaches knew this race<br />\nwould be different. Looking<br />\ntres sportif in his Nehru coat,<br />\nFranklin and Marshall's coach,<br />\nChuck Studly expected a<br />\n\"bizarre race.\"<br />\nThe start of the race was the<br />\nstart of a 3.1-mile nightmare.<br />\nAs the runners covered the<br />\ncourse, they were engulfed in<br />\nthe screams of their helpless<br />\npeers. Through the slippery<br />\nmud, runners began falling, and<br />\nin attempts to regain balance,<br />\ngrabbed the nearest solid object. Unluckily, these objects<br />\noften turned out to be other<br />\nrunners whose balances were<br />\nalready precarious. The result<br />\nwas a horror show. In spite of<br />\ntheir previous surefootedness,<br />\nthe Lady Jays were not to be<br />\nspared.<br />\nSenior Mureen Shea suffered<br />\na spiral fraction (a common<br />\nboxing injury) as she fell twice<br />\nduring the race. Running on,<br />\nShea finished 5th for the Jays<br />\nand 46th overall. What is<br />\nremarkable was Shea's ability<br />\nto finish the race with her<br />\ninjury.<br />\nFinishing first for the Jays<br />\nand 30th overall was frosh Molly Bardsley. Bardsley's only<br />\nserious setback came when she<br />\nslipped and somersaulted<br />\nthrough the air. Quickly regaining her senses, the competitive<br />\nBardsley was up quickly and<br />\nrunning. However, something<br />\nwas not right, too many competitors were passing her. It was<br />\nthen Bardsley realized she was<br />\nrunning in the wrong direction.<br />\n<br />\nChanging course, she raced in<br />\nto finish with a time of 21:31.<br />\nBehind Bardsley were Cecilia<br />\nKing, 35th overall in 21:48; a<br />\nrelatively unscathed Anita Kim,<br />\n37th overall in 21:51; Suzi<br />\nMcGinn 40th in 21:59; Shea in<br />\n22:14; Tami Oki 48th in 22:22<br />\nand Sindee Gazansky 75th in<br />\n24:48.<br />\nKudos are especially in order<br />\nfor Gozansky who suffered the<br />\nbeginning stages of hypothermic shock just to finish the<br />\nrace. A warm weather runner,<br />\nGozansky was most unprepared<br />\nfor the elements. Running the<br />\nrace with only her uniform and<br />\na pair of gloves, the exposed<br />\nparts of her body suffered<br />\nheavily. Upon finishing,<br />\nGozansky collapsed and was<br />\nonly fully revived after a long<br />\nhot shower.<br />\nAnother noteworthy performance was that of Anita Kim.<br />\nKim ran the relatively best race<br />\nof all the Jays finishing 3rd for<br />\nthe squad. This achievement<br />\nalong without falling once during the race led to much praise<br />\nEleanor<br />\nCoach<br />\nfrom<br />\nSimonsick.<br />\nOverall for the Jays, this has<br />\nbeen an outstanding season.<br />\nCoaches Simonsick and Green<br />\nrank this year's squad as the<br />\nbest ever in Hopkins history.<br />\nThe evidence to support this<br />\nclaim are the squad's final dual<br />\nmeet record of 11-2 and also the<br />\nsquad's high finish in large<br />\ncompetitions.<br />\nNext year's Harriers hope to<br />\ncontinue the standards of high<br />\nperformance set this year. It is<br />\nlikely that they will, as only two<br />\nmembers of the Magnificent<br />\nSeven are graduating, seniors<br />\nMaureen Shea and Tami Oki.<br />\nHopefully, the shoes of these<br />\ntwo talented runners will be filled<br />\nby returning Harriers and also<br />\n<br />\nrecruits from New Jersey and<br />\nother foreign countries.<br />\nIn the nearer future, coaches<br />\nGreen and Simonsick are looking forward to an awesome<br />\nspring track team as runners<br />\nBardsley, McGinn and Shea<br />\n<br />\nwill transfer their talents to the<br />\nsynthetic oval. For all involved,<br />\nthis has been a great season.<br />\nGood luck in future pursuits<br />\nand, in the words of Jay runner Hyonah Shin, let's get<br />\n\"psyched for next year.\"<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nHERE'S AN IDEATHAT<br />\nCOULD MEAN...<br />\n_<br />\n61'\"it ,<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n.onh<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n0011111111<br />\n<br />\n7P<br />\n'.<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\nill lif<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n,-:<br />\n<br />\nMONEY IN<br />\nYOUR POCKET '<br />\n,<br />\ni<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nNeed some Christmas green?<br />\nEvery time you make a purchase<br />\nat the Open House from now to<br />\nDecember 10, you can enter our<br />\ndrawing.

The cost<br />\nfor the 1985-6 academic year of<br />\nthese plans are $1890 and<br />\n$1690.<br />\nThe casual meal rates, posted<br />\nat the Terrace Room's entrance, are $2.50 for breakfast,<br />\n$3.50 for lunch or brunch, and<br />\n$4.50 for dinner.

If they're going to be<br />\npaying off this $9 million debt<br />\nor parts thereof, then there<br />\nmust be a large gap between the<br />\nprice that students pay and the<br />\nprice that the university pays<br />\nthe food service, because the only costs the university has other<br />\nthan those directly to the food<br />\nservice are utilities and the cost<br />\nof the cafeteria.\"<br />\n\"It strikes me that at the time<br />\nthe debt is paid off,\" said<br />\nKupritz, \"the university will<br />\nnot be inclined to reduce the<br />\nrates of the board plan<br />\nsignificantly.

And such<br />\nthoughts have brought us to make what<br />\nsome will no doubt view as a rash suggestion: abolish the SAC Seals.<br />\nFor the uninitiated, the Seals are<br />\nawards given by the Student Activities<br />\nCommission to graduating seniors who<br />\nhave contributed to extracurricular activities. In theory, the idea is fine. Many<br />\nstudents devote a lot of time to student<br />\nclubs or publications or the student<br />\ngovernment. While their colleagues are<br />\nburied on D-level all day, these people<br />\nsacrifice a lot of time and energy trying<br />\nto make Hopkins a more interesting<br />\nplace. At graduation, the argument goes,<br />\nthey ought to get a little recognition in<br />\nfront of Mommy and Daddy.<br />\nSo what's wrong with all that? Well,<br />\nunfortunately, it's never that simple.<br />\nAlmost every year, some sort of a ruckus<br />\ndevelops over who should\u2014and who<br />\nshouldn't\u2014get a Seal. It all gets<br />\nremarkably personal: \"So-and-so never<br />\ndid a thing;\" \"He worked his rear off<br />\nfor us, and you don't want to give him<br />\na Seal just because you don't like him;\"<br />\netc. In the end, both the SAC and the<br />\nStudent Council, which must approve<br />\nthe list of recipients, often look quite silly. Two years ago, the brouhaha became<br />\nso intense, in fact, that several students<br />\nwere within a hair's-breadth of asking<br />\nthat their names be removed from the<br />\nlist, and\u2014at a public meeting\u2014one<br />\nCouncil member used a four-letter-word<br />\ntowards another. All of this means that<br /><br />\njust as graduation is approaching (a time<br />\nwhen seniors would feel a certain esprit<br />\nde corps, one hopes)a lot of unnecessary<br />\nhostility is created.<br />\nAnd when you get right down to it,<br />\nthere really aren't very many good<br />\narguments in favor of the Seals. Surely<br />\nnobody dedicates four years to an extracurricular activity just so he can stand<br />\nup and receive an award at graduation;<br />\nhe does it because he enjoys it. Indeed,<br />\nwe've always suspected that many of the<br />\nSeals' defenders don't give a hoot about<br />\nshowing off at commencement. They're<br />\njust appalled at the idea of losing such<br />\nfine resume fodder.<br />\nAdmittedly the process of picking Seal<br />\nrecipients went fairly smoothly last year.<br />\nBut this was accomplished mainly by an<br />\ninteresting legislative sleight of hand<br />\nwhich barred the SAC General Assembly<br />\nand the Student Council from raising objections to specific members of the list<br />\nprepared by the SAC Executive Board.<br />\nThat meant both the SAC and the Council had to pass the list or send the whole<br />\nthing back to the Board, and with<br />\ngraduation fast approaching they didn't<br />\nhave much of a choice. It isn't really<br />\nmuch of a system, though, in that it concentrates complete power in the hands of<br />\nthe Board. (It also remains to be explained<br />\nhow the Board can tell its two superior<br />\norganizations what to do.)<br />\nSimply glossing over the problem last<br />\nyear was by no means a long-term solution. Sooner or later, the Seals will once<br />\nagain cause as much animosity as they<br />\nused to. A little recognition for students<br />\nwho have worked hard might be nice,<br />\nbut it isn't worth the hassle of the Seals.<br /><br />\nA Second WJHU<br />\nDifficult problems rarely present truly satisfying solutions. Usually the choice<br />\nis between the lesser of two evils. But in<br />\nthe last couple weeks, a remarkably<br />\nsimple\u2014yet adequate\u2014answer to the<br />\nquestion of a student radio station at<br />\nHopkins has been proposed: a second<br />\nWJHU.<br />\n\\ The idea, quite simply, is to create a<br />\nnew 10-watt station when WJHU goes<br />\nto 25,000 watts sometime next spring,<br />\nThe smaller station would continue to be<br />\nstudent-run and student-staffed. We<br />\nrealize, of course, it couldn't actually<br />\nhave WJHU as its call letters; we're<br />\nsimply calling it that for lack of a better<br />\nname. The minor student involvement<br />\nslated for the 25,000-watt WJHU would<br />\ncertainly still be welcome, but the smaller<br />\nstation would allow students interested<br />\nin actually running a station to do so.<br />\nThe plan's feasibility remains to be examined closely, but it is an interesting<br />\nidea. Rejecting it out of hand, as the administration appears to have done, is a<br />\nmistake.<br />\nThe idea has come from several current WJHU staff members. They correctly point out that student activity at<br />\nthe 25,000-watt station will be virtually<br /><br />\nnil, administration claims to the contrary<br />\nnotwithstanding. The facts are that only three part-time positions will be reserved<br />\nfor students, and that students will have<br />\nto compete with professionals for other<br />\njobs. That means, in effect, that students<br />\nwill be eliminated from any meaningful<br />\nrole at WJHU after the power increase.<br />\nWhether or not such complete professional control is a good idea is a red herring now, but the students who currently run WJHU\u2014especially the<br />\nunderclassmen\u2014are understandably<br />\nupset.<br />\nB.J. Norris, vice president for cornmunications and public affairs and the<br />\nperson ultimately responsible for<br />\nWJHU, says the administration's<br />\nresponse to the plea for a second station<br />\nis that the university is going to have only<br />\none radio station. Why? Norris doesn't<br />\nreally say. There simply is going to be<br />\none station and one station only, she<br />\ninsists.<br />\nWe're not fully endorsing the idea of<br />\na second Hopkins radio station. All sorts<br />\nof problems need to be investigated. But<br />\ninstead of shooting down an innovative<br />\nproposal, the administration ought to be<br />\nwilling to consider it.<br /><br />\nIt was 10:43\u2014only 7 minutes<br />\nbefore his first (and last) class,<br />\nHistory of Greek Art and its<br />\nRamifications Upon Polish<br />\nSexuality, would be over.

As he<br />\nwandered through the halls of<br />\nGilman, he was startled by<br />\nwisps of smoke pouring out<br />\nfrom behind a closed door. Bill<br />\nlooked at the door, and read<br />\nthe attached sign (with his lips<br />\nmoving), \"T-E-A-C-H-I-N-G<br />\nA-S-S-I-S-T-A-N-T-S.\"<br />\nA perplexed look came over<br />\nBill's face, and then, ever so<br />\ncautiously, he opened the door.<br />\nSix TA's inside the room slowly turned to look at him.

He began to<br />\nrun, and continued to do so until he was stopped by a little<br />\ngirl.<br />\n\"Would you like a donut?\"<br />\nthe little girl looked up and<br />\nasked.<br />\nBill looked aroung the room<br />\nin which he suddenly found<br />\nhimself. He was surrounded by<br />\ntables and tables of people who<br />\nwere all eating donuts, drinking<br />\ncoffee, and smoking. They<br />\nchattered away in a language<br />\nthat Bill could not quite<br />\nunderstand.<br />\n\"No thank you,\" Bill<br />\nanswered, \"I don't like<br />\ndonuts.\"<br />\nA deadly silence fell over the<br />\nroom, as every occupant turned to look at Bill.<br />\n\"But that one does look<br />\nrather tasty; I think I will have<br />\nContinued on Page 8<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nEditor<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nMary Ginder<br />\nProduction Manager<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nT.J.

The marble pillars, brick<br />\nwall, and glass windows are<br />\ngenerally free of posters. In fact<br />\nthe only places that look like<br />\n\"garbage dumps\" are the<br />\nbulletin boards themselves.<br />\nHasn't the editor seen the innumerable European vacation<br />\nads, magazine discounts, and<br />\ncredit card applications stapled<br />\nto every bulletin board? Last<br />\nweek I even saw several ads for<br />\nthe -Miss Baltimore's Best\"<br />\npageant. Add to this the<br />\nmonths-old posters that are<br />\nnever removed and what is<br />\ngenerated is not publicity, but<br />\na mess.

No. Instead, he offers<br />\na modest proposal: \"If you see<br />\na poster stuck on a wall where<br />\nit doesn't belong, do two<br />\nthings. First, rip it down. Second, don't go to the event.\"<br />\nThat has to be the most<br />\nridiculous statement I've ever<br />\nread on these pages. Here is the<br />\nNews-Letter's usually loud<br />\nvoice in the condemnation of<br />\nthe notorious Hopkins apathy,<br />\nactually telling students not to<br />\ngo to an event.<br />\nThe editor has obviously<br />\nwritten an uninformed and irresponsible article. Why did he<br />\ndo this? Was it because he<br />\nbelieved the entire poster controversy to be so \"patently silly\" that he did not make the effort to present an intelligent<br />\ncommentary?<br />\nIf so, then this is unacceptable.

To do otherwise is<br />\nto perpetuate injustice.<br />\nMichael Harrigan<br /><br />\nOz and After Hours<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe disagree with Steve<br />\nBrett's critique of Martin<br />\nScorsese's After Hours. Instead<br />\nof this movie being \"the best<br />\n'leave your brain at the door'<br />\ntype of picture to come along in<br />\nsome time,\" After Hours is one<br />\nof the most clever movies we<br />\nhave seen in a great while.<br />\nAlthough the picture abounds<br />\nwith hints and clues, Brett<br />\nseems to miss the subtle and<br />\ndoes not recognize After Hours<br />\nas the 1985 reincarnation of the<br />\nall-time classic, The Wizard of<br />\nOz.<br />\nHow often does Griffin<br />\nDunne (Dorothy) utter the immortal words, \"I just want to<br />\ngo home?\" Was not the cab<br />\nride a close enough approximation to a tornado for all but the<br />\nmost steadfast? Although we<br />\nstill have a few weak spots in<br />\nour analysis, After Hours is a<br />\nremarkable take-off. Dunne<br />\nstarts off by unintentionally<br />\nkilling Roseanna Arquette(The<br />\nWicked Witch of the East). The<br />\nthree women that Dunne meets<br />\nall resemble the character of the<br />\nWicked Witch of the West. The<br />\norganization of a vigilante mob<br />\nto search for Dunne in SoHo<br />\nbrings to mind the Wicked<br />\nWitch's chase of Dorothy<br />\nthrough Oz. Likewise, the shot<br />\nof Terri Garr on her bicycle<br />\nequipped with basket is so close<br />\nContinued on Page 8<br /><br />\n8/NOVEMBER 22, 1985<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from Page 7<br />\nto that of Margaret Hamilton<br />\nthat it is spooky. There is an incredible fire motif in After<br />\nHours as there was in The<br />\nWizard of Oz. One of the<br />\nwomen even tries to burn paper<br />\nmache off of Dunne's skin. He<br />\nis imprisoned in paper mache<br />\narmor and cannot move, like<br />\nthe rusted'tin man. Another<br />\nmotif that is common to both<br />\nmovies is that of sleep. Roseanna Arquette overdoses on pills<br />\nwhile Dunne, exhausted, staggers through SoHo. In The<br />\nWizard of Oz, the Wicked<br />\nWitch attempts to kill Dorothy<br />\nand her friends by putting them<br />\nto sleep in a field of poppies.<br />\nThe fact that Brett<br />\ncharacterizes After Hours as<br />\n\".just a bunch of events lacking<br />\nsomething which can serve to<br />\ntie it all together\" says much<br />\nfor the genius of Scorsese, who<br />\nhas succeeded in doing<br /><br />\nclear.

But Wolman's association<br />\nwith the university goes back<br />\nlong before there was a<br />\nWolman Hall, or for that matter, a Homewood campus.<br />\nAfter graduating from<br />\nHopkins in 1913 with a B.A. in<br />\nnatural science, Wolman was<br />\nprepared for medical school.<br />\nHis parents, however, already<br />\nwith an elder son headed<br />\ntowards the medical profession,<br />\ntold him that he was to become<br />\nan engineer instead. When asked<br />\nyears later if he harbored<br />\nthoughts of rebellion at this imposition by his parents,<br />\nWolman replied that he hadn't<br />\nuntil the very moment of the<br />\nquestion! So, Wolman went on,<br />\nin 1915, to graduate in a group<br />\nof four students as a member of<br />\nthe first class of the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Engineering.<br />\nThroughout the years since<br />\nthen, Wolman has served locally, nationally, and even internationally in many areas relating<br />\nto his specialty\u2014sanitary<br />\nengineering. Along with his<br />\ncommission as \"Admiral of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay\" by the governor of Maryland for his initial<br />\nchairmanship of the Maryland<br />\nState Planning Commission<br />\nand the dedication of the<br />\nBaltimore Public Works<br /><br />\nMuseum as \"The Liveable City:<br />\nDr. Abel Wolman and the Contiuing Work of the Engineer.\"<br />\nAt the same time, he has been<br />\na prized lecturer at some of the<br />\nmost distinguished universities<br />\nin the country: Johns Hopkins,<br />\nHarvard, Princeton, the<br />\nUniversity of Chicago, and the<br />\nUniversity of Southern California among others. At one time<br />\nin 1926, he commuted weekly<br />\nbetween Hopkins and Harvard<br />\nto give lectures at both institutions. Looking back on this,<br />\nWolman finds it hard to believe<br />\nhe ever did something like that,<br />\nremembering there was no air<br />\ntravel back then; the fastest<br />\nmeans was the midnight train<br />\nfrom Boston to Baltimore.<br />\nFrom 1937 to 1962, Wolman<br />\nheld a permanent position at<br />\nHopkins as the chairman of<br />\nsanitary engineering both at the<br />\nSchool of Engineering and the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth. He required his<br />\nstudents at the Homewood<br />\ncampus to take courses such as<br />\nepidemiology and physiology in<br />\nthe Medical School, while he<br />\nhad his students there come and<br />\nattend lectures at Homewood.<br />\nSuch interaction between campuses he sees as good and still<br />\nendorses today. One course<br />\nwhich Wolman taught himself<br />\nthroughout his many years here<br />\nwas entitled, \"Legal and Social<br />\nImplications of Engineering,\"<br />\nfor, as he points out, an<br />\nengineer's work directly affects<br />\nthe public, especially on the<br />\ntopic of sanitary engineering,<br />\nHe was pleasantly surprised<br />\nwith the recent addition of a<br />\ncourse entitled \"Ethics\" to<br />\n-the chemical engineering<br /><br />\ncurriculum.<br />\nThe effects of Wolman's<br />\nwork can be seen throughout<br />\nthe world, but they can be<br />\nespecially well noticed right<br />\nhere in Baltimore. As an advisor to the mayor of Baltimore<br />\nfor more than forty years on<br />\nwater resources, as a member<br />\nof various boards and commissions concerning Baltimore's<br />\npublic works, and as a consulting engineer, Wolman has<br />\nbeen instrumental in the<br />\ndevelopment of Baltimore's<br />\nrenowned water supply system<br />\nand in the restoration of the<br />\nonce filthy harbor. As a young<br />\nman growing up in Baltimore,<br />\nWolman remembers that you<br />\ncould tell you were nearing the<br />\ncity when coming up the<br />\nChesapeake by the stench of the<br />\nharbor, sometimes sensed five<br />\nmiles away.<br />\nWhen Wolman presented an<br />\nidea of cleaning up the harbor<br />\nto a mayor of Baltimore many<br />\nyears ago, a plan he envisioned<br />\nfrom the sight of the harbor in<br />\nStockholm, Sweden, it received<br />\nan enthusiastic reponse. Cornmenting on why things were<br />\nable to improve in Baltimore,<br />\nWolman says that the city has<br />\nbeen blessed with many fine<br />\nmayors over the past few<br />\ndecades who have worked with<br />\nand listened to many dedicated<br />\nmen to bring about the beauty,<br />\ncleanliness, and health, which<br />\ngood water resources management provides. An engineer can<br />\nhave great plans, but without<br />\nthe poitician to sell them to,<br />\nthey will never be realized. Fortunately, Baltimore has had<br />\nboth public officials with<br />\nforesight and engineers with<br /><br />\nGreystOrie Studios<br /><br />\nHe couldn't get enough of JHU\u2014Abel Wolman in 1940.<br /><br />\nideas who have coordinated<br />\ntheir efforts through the years.<br />\nWhen asked for any words of<br />\nwisdom gleaned throughout his<br />\nlife, Wolman responded with a<br />\nreply given by Mr. Hilton (of<br />\nhotel fame) to a similar question. \"Always remember to put<br />\nthe shower curtain inside the<br />\ntub,' and its consequent corrollary, \"Water will penetrate<br />\nanything.\" Finally though, he<br /><br />\nstated, \"Everything in my<br />\nlifetime has turned out independent of design or plan.\" He<br />\nsaid that some people were<br />\nlucky and had their entire<br />\nfuture mapped out, but others<br />\ndo not and they should not feel<br />\nthat a plan is necessary for success.

Rumpled sharpshooter, Major Powell holds<br />\nthe smoking gun. Powell has<br />\njust murdered Evelyn. But<br />\nwait! Has he really? Or perhaps<br />\nis Evelyn still alive despite the<br />\nhuge bloodstain on his chest?<br />\nOr perhaps \"Evelyn\" is really<br />\nhis twin brother Rupert\u2014stingy<br />\nmillionaire and friend to King<br />\nEdward? And where does the<br />\nmysterious Powell fit into this<br />\nwhole setup of murder and confusion? This is the problem that<br />\nserves as the core of Gerald<br />\nMoon's hilarious, oldfashioned mystery-comedy,<br />\nCorpse!, currently playing at<br />\n'the Morris Mechanic Theatre.<br />\nThere is not a lot one can say<br />\nabout this play and this particular production without<br />\nunravelling what needs to be<br />\nunravelled by the theatre-goer<br />\nhimself. Suffice it to say that it<br />\nis a solidly twisted mystery\u2014<br />\nwith turns galore\u2014but it is contemporary enough (it is Moon's<br />\nfirst play) that it can have fun<br />\nwith the old mystery conventions. The presence of twins is<br />\nenough to cue one that it is going to be a farce.<br />\nThe roles of Evelyn/Rupert<br />\nand Major Powell are handled<br />\nquite excellently by stage<br />\nveterans Keith Baxter and Milo<br />\nO'Shea. Baxter switches effortlessly between his two roles<br />\nand even has Evelyn imitate<br />\nRupert convincingly on a few<br />\noccasions. If there is ever any<br />\nEvelyn's<br />\nwith<br />\nproblem<br />\nto a<br />\nramblings<br />\npsychopathic<br />\nthem,<br />\npitch\u2014making<br />\nfever<br />\ndepending on the scene, too uncomfortably real or just plain<br />\nmelodramatic.<br />\nO'Shea, who won a Tony<br />\nAward nomination in 1983 for<br />\nhis performance in Mass Ap-<br /><br />\npeal and who was last seen in<br />\nWoody Allen's Purple Rose of<br />\nCairo, makes Major Powell the<br />\nmost sympathetic character in<br />\nthe play despite the fact that<br />\nhe's a hired killer\u2014although it<br />\nis hard not to be sympathetic<br />\nwhen you look more like Captain Kangaroo than a paid<br />\nassassin. O'Shea's bumblings<br />\nand adept slapstick physical<br />\nhumor quite easily steal the<br />\nshow.<br />\nThe supporting performances of Pauline Flanagan, as<br />\nEvelyn's nosy landlady, and<br />\nScott LaFeber as Constable<br />\nHawkins, are also quite<br />\nexcellent.<br />\nPerhaps the real star of this<br />\nshow, however, is the production itself. The revolving set is<br />\namazingly ingenious and is probably one of the most elaborate<br />\nto be seen in Baltimore in a<br />\nwhile. In any mystery there<br />\nmust be an enormous attention<br />\nto detail and Corpse! does not<br />\nneglect a thing. For example,<br />\nwhen Evelyn makes dinner,<br />\nsmoke comes out the chimney.<br />\nAnd quite a few times you<br />\nwould swear that both Rupert<br />\nand Evelyn were on the stage at<br />\nthe same time although, of<br />\ncourse, that's impossible.<br />\nCorpse!is quite entertaining,<br />\nif not perhaps extremely<br />\noriginal or \"thrilling,\" and its<br />\nplot, though complicated, is<br />\nvery convincingly untangled.<br />\nThe ticket prices for the<br />\nMechanic production, which<br />\nruns through December 8,<br />\nrange from $25 to $17.50 and<br />\nhalf-price student rush tickets<br />\nare available at the box office<br />\nan hour to a half-hour before<br />\nshowtime.

The lingering<br />\nresonance of Winters' soprano<br />\nsax in this cavernous stone<br />\nbuilding created an ambience<br />\nand an image of far away places<br />\nthat lingered resonantly in my<br />\nhead long after the concert was<br />\nover. The reverberation was<br />\nsuch that a note would be<br />\nplayed, held over until reached<br />\nfull maturity, then left to<br />\nwander about the room on its<br />\nown as another took its place.<br />\nIt was not entirely by accident,<br />\nthqugh, that this setting was<br />\nchosen. Two months ago, Paul<br />\n'Winter released his latest<br />\nalbum, Canyon. It was recorded, in part, at the Cathedral of<br />\nSt. John the Divine(the largest<br />\ncathedral in the world, New<br />\nYork City)earlier this year, and<br />\nin the Grand Canyon, during a<br />\nraft trip down the Colorado<br />\nRiver in 1980. For the most<br />\npart, Friday's concert tried to<br />\ncapture the same quality and atmosphere achieved on this<br />\nalbum.<br />\nThe taped sounds and the<br />\nsinging of Susan Osborne<br />\n(whose remarkable voice<br /><br />\nbenefited from the resonant<br />\nchamber as much as any of the<br />\ninstruments) were also elements<br />\nfrom previous albums, the<br />\nformer, in fact, being a<br />\ntrademark of Paul Winters'<br />\nmusic. The tapes were played<br />\nthree or four times during the<br />\nconcert, sometimes serving as<br />\nthe foundation for a piece,<br />\nother times providing an added dimension to a previously<br />\nconceived song. In each instance, though, whether the<br />\ntape was of a wolf howling or<br />\na whale singing, the ethereal<br />\nquality of the instruments<br />\nplayed in this cathedral was<br />\nnearly indistinguishable from<br />\nthat of the animal voices. A<br />\nhaunting, pleading cry of the<br />\nwhales was transformed into a<br />\nmournful melody on the saxaphone, with no discernible<br />\ntransition. The wolf cries, too,<br />\nwere taken up by the French<br />\nhorn, the sax, and (at Paul's request) the audience.<br />\nThis mingling of animal and<br />\nhuman songs represents, more<br />\nthan anything else, perhaps,<br />\nwhat Paul Winter has been trying to achieve with his music<br />\nfor the past fifteen years or so.<br />\nWith his new Paul Winter Consort (two of the original<br />\nmembers, Robert Towner and<br />\nColin Walcott, went on to form<br />\nthe band Oregon) and the<br />\nrecord label he founded in<br />\n1980, Living Music Records,<br />\nPaul Winter has attempted not<br />\nonly to capture nature in music,<br />\nbut to do it in a simple way, one<br />\nwhich most people can appreciate and understand. In<br />\nachieving this, he established<br />\nthe increasingly popular genre<br />\nof music known as \"environmental\" or \"new age\"<br />\nmusic. Recording and performing in such places as the Grand<br />\nCanyon and St. John's<br />\nCathedral is a perfect example<br />\nof a simple concept which<br /><br />\nenhances the natural, atmospheric ambience of his<br />\nmusic, even to the extent where<br />\nit is an integral part of that<br />\nmusic. Indeed, his concert Friday would have been<br />\ndramatically different if it had<br />\nbeen performed just about<br />\nanywhere else in Baltimore,<br />\neven in the Civic Center; the<br />\nacoustics were that significant.<br />\nOf course, I couldn't understand a word he said, but I certainly didn't go to the concert<br />\nto hear him speak.<br />\nAt present, the Paul Winter<br />\nConsort consists of four musicians, excluding Winter. John<br />\nClark, the French horn; and<br />\nGlenn Velez, percussion. Susan<br />\nOsborne, their guest artist on<br />\nFriday is a reknowned alto who<br />\nhad contributed to one previous<br />\nalbum by Winter. Each instrument, in the echoing cavity of<br />\nthe Cathedral, took on a quality that was almost unrecognizable. In addition to this,<br />\nsome of the performers (Osborne, Velez, and Winter)<br />\nquietly made their way to the<br />\nrear of the Cathedral, at different points in the concert,<br />\nthen slowly walked down the<br />\ncentral aisle, playing solo.<br />\nWhen this happened, it was difficult to discern, at first, where<br />\nthe sound was coming from.<br />\nHaving chosen a seat next to<br />\nthe mixing boards (and other<br />\ncontrol equipment), my first<br />\nreaction was to glance at the<br />\ntape recorder to see if it was<br />\nmoving. Needless to say, the instruments were unamplified or<br />\nthese occasions(they were miked up front), but the difference<br />\nin volume was hardly noticeable (certainly it was made up<br />\nfor by the more complete<br />\ndispersion of the sound.)<br />\nAs far as I could tell, Velez<br />\nprimarily played only one instrument, though it often<br />\nContinued on Page 12<br /><br />\n12/NOVEMBER 22, 1985<br /><br />\nMUSIC:<br /><br />\nArts Calendar!<br /><br />\nMOVIES:<br />\nSenior Class Film Series:<br />\nRacing with the Moon.

It is<br />\ndescribed in the credits of Canyon as a \"desert drum...a<br />\nNorth African frame drum with<br />\nsnares, played with fingers.\" It<br />\nresembles an oversized tamborine (without jingles), supported and held by a pair of intersecting rods on one side. The<br />\nsounds which emanated from<br />\nthis instrument ranged from<br />\nsometing that was more li!-e a<br />\ncello than the 'cello, produced<br />\nby slowly rubbing the thumb<br />\nalong the outer edge of the<br />\nface, to a buzzing, rattling<br />\nsound, which consistently gave<br />\nthe impression that it, or<br />\nsomething else, was about to<br />\nfall apart. Velez also made use<br />\nof the rim, striking it with his<br />\nhand for a more conventional<br />\nknocking sound, used to punctuate the rhythmic rattling. The<br />\nother instrument Velez used<br />\nwas the triangle, which he<br />\nplayed by striking it very rapidly and establishing a fast-paced<br />\nrhythm, contrasting nicely with<br />\nthe drum. In general, the drum<br />\nwas used in the more lively<br />\npieces, and only occasionally<br />\nduring the slow, drifting<br />\nmelodies of the sax, horn, or<br />\n'cello.<br />\nEugene Friesen played the<br />\n'cello with great precision, giving it very little vibrato. It's<br />\nlong, deep notes, clear and unwavering, resembled those of a<br />\nsynthesizer; its high notes,<br />\nequally,clear. and steady, were<br />\nnot unlike those of the sax. It<br /><br />\nsharing in, the melodic development.

H \u2022 S;<br /><br />\n('H11 1)PE<br /><br />\nIhave beenforced to modify my<br />\ntheory concerning Mrs. Auel's<br />\nuntimely death. My new theory<br />\nis that she was only seriously<br />\ninjured.<br /><br />\nThis is my theory, a few<br />\nmonths after Crown Publishers<br />\nreleased Jean M. Auel's novel<br />\nThe Clan of the Cave Bear,<br />\nMrs. Auel found herself in a<br />\nvery bad car crash, and much<br />\nto the dismay of the publishers<br />\nshe died. Crown kept the whole<br />\nmessy business under wraps but<br />\nafter the novel went on the<br />\nbecome a big hit, people began<br />\nscreaming \"Movie! Merchandise!! Sequel!!!\" and the<br />\nCrown execs began screaming.<br />\nThis went on for some time<br />\n(and became quite noisy) until<br />\none day a bright young lad in<br />\nthe PR department had an<br />\nidea\u2014it wasn't a very good idea<br />\nbut it would work. What they<br />\ndid (at least in my theory) was<br />\nto sign on some cheap, two bit<br />\nromance writer who cranked<br />\nout a sequel(The Valley of the<br />\nHorses) in a matter of days.<br />\nThe trashy sequel bears about<br />\nas much resemblance to the<br />\noriginal as Easyrider does to<br />\nRoad and Track, yet it seems<br />\nCrown knows what people<br />\nwant because the sequel went<br />\non to outsell the first book.<br />\nAnd now, Crown has released<br />\nthe much awaited third book of<br />\nJean M. Auel's \"Earth's<br />\nChildren\" series, The Mammoth Hunters.<br />\nFor all those who don't<br />\nknow, the Earth's Children<br />\nseries takes place in prehistoric<br /><br />\nEurope during the ice age<br />\n(about 35,000 to 25,000 years<br />\nago). It is the story of a young<br />\ngirl named Ayla who loses her<br />\npeople in an earthquake and as<br />\na result, she is taken in and raised<br />\nby a people who call themselves<br />\n\"the clan of the cave bear\".<br />\nThe clan, it turns out, are an example of divergent evolution,<br />\nthey are similar in some ways to<br />\nAyla's people yet very different<br />\nin others. The second book<br />\nconcerns itself mainly with<br />\nwhat happens to Ayla(now age<br />\n17) when she is kicked out of<br />\nthe clan, and finally comes face<br />\nto face(hmm)with a nice man<br />\nof her own species named Jondalar (read: Lance). The rest of<br />\nthe plot is squeezed in between<br />\na multitude of overwritten sex<br />\nscenes.<br />\nThe third book begins with<br />\nAyla and Jondalar meeting<br />\nhumans known as the Mamutoi<br />\n(The Mammoth Hunters), and<br />\nfrom there the novel is generally<br />\na story about how the Mamutoi<br />\n(numbering about 27)live, their<br />\ncustoms and beliefs. But in particular the story is about the<br />\nrelationship between Ayla, Jondalar, and Ranec, a Mamutoi<br />\nman who competes with Jondalar for Ayla affections.<br />\nThe amount of research that<br />\nwent into writing this book is<br />\nobvious, Mrs. Auel manages to<br />\nshow us in an interesting and<br />\nentertaining way, information<br />\nwhich until now could only be<br />\nfound in the driest of anthropological texts. It is<br />\nbecause of this almost<br />\nethnographic information that<br /><br />\none finds the more fantastic<br />\nelements of the story tolerable.<br />\nOn one level, The Mammoth<br />\nHunters can be viewed as a case<br />\nstudy in primitive group<br />\ndynamics, while on another it<br />\nis a story about people and their<br />\nfeelings. Viewed either way this<br />\nbook is much better than the<br />\none before and a lot of the ideas<br />\nwhich made the first noteworthy<br />\nare present. My biggest complaint would have to be that a<br />\nbit of the \"Boy mates Girl\"<br />\nconcept of love is carried over<br />\nfrom the second book. It seems<br />\nthat at some points in the story<br />\nMrs. Auel tends to forget that<br />\nlove is more a matter of<br />\nchemistry than of physics.<br />\nAfter reading this book, I<br />\nhave been forced to modify my<br />\nthe3ry concerning Mrs. Auel's<br />\nuntimely death. My new theory<br />\nis that she was only seriously injured, or perhaps lapsed into a<br />\ncoma for a few years as a result<br />\nof her smash up. I take The<br />\nMammoth Hunters to be a<br />\nstrong sign of her recovery and<br />\nhope that with the next book in<br />\nher series she is able to regain<br />\nthat which made her first work<br />\na piece of art. It would be a pity if instead she regressed again<br />\ninto writing semi-pornographic<br />\ntrash in order to sell more<br />\ncopies to middle aged housewives.<br /><br />\nEditor's Note: There is a film<br />\nbased on the first two books<br />\ncoming out, starring Daryl<br />\nHannah, screenplay by John<br />\nSay/es.<br /><br />\nBaldwin: Too Much Fury, Too Little Perce<br />\nEvidence of Things Not Seen<br />\nexamines the state of race relations in America.

The Swallowing<br />\nCenter, the only one of its kind,<br />\nwas started almost five years<br />\nago by the current director, Dr.<br />\nMartin Donner, and Dr. James<br />\nBosma, then at the National Institutes of Health. Before the<br />\nexistence of the Swallowing<br />\nCenter, many doctors, including those at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, had been<br />\nswallowing<br />\nresearching<br />\ndisorders independently. Dr.<br />\nDonner and Dr. Bosma had<br />\nbeen in contact for many years<br />\nwhen Dr. Donner proposed the<br />\nidea for the Center.<br />\nSwallowing disorders treated<br />\nat the Center include the inability to ingest solids, the inability<br />\nto drink liquids and other problems coordinating respiration<br />\nand swallowing. Swallowing is<br />\na complicated process which<br />\nstarts at the mouth and ends at<br />\nthe opening to the stomach, requiring the function of twentysix muscles and six cranial<br />\nnerves.<br />\nPeople who have problems<br />\ningesting solid food suffer from<br />\nthe food lodging somewhere in<br />\nthe esophagus or trachea. In<br />\nthese cases, pureed food, rather<br />\nthan solid food, must be eaten<br /><br />\nsince pureed food requires less<br />\nmuscle power to propel it<br />\ndownward. For those unable to<br />\ndrink liquids, a fluid-rich gel<br />\nhas been developed which<br />\nallows the patient to enjoy such<br />\ncommon liquids as coffee and<br />\norange juice. Liquids are<br />\ntroublesome to some people<br />\nbecause the liquid immediately<br />\ndisperses upon swallowing,<br />\nsome of it ending up in the<br />\nlungs. The gel has more cohesion and is designed so it liquifies farther down the tract.<br />\nThe symptoms of swallowing<br />\nmay not always be so obvious.<br />\nFor example, a persistent cough<br />\nwhich resurfaces when eating or<br />\ndrinking may be an indication<br />\nthat food is sliding down the<br />\nwindpipe. Another indication<br />\nmay be when the voice suddenly changes and becomes difficult to understand when a person speaks. In fact, a person,<br />\nmay not notice the swallowing<br />\ndifficulty until a much later<br />\ndate due to voluntary and incompensation<br />\nvoluntary<br />\nabilities of the body.<br />\nVoluntary compensation includes a sometimes subconscious choice by the person<br />\nto eat slowly or to eat only<br />\npureed foods which \"go down\"<br />\neasier. Involuntary compensation includes losing some func-<br /><br />\ntions of the muscles which,<br />\nnevertheless, allow the person<br />\nto swallow to a lesser degree.<br />\nDepending upon the specific<br />\nproblem, delaying treatment<br />\ncan lead to progressive worsening of the condition. The<br />\ntrachea may become completely obstructed resulting in choking or massive aspiration. This<br />\nis known as decompensation.<br />\nThe body can no longer compensate because the problem<br />\nhas built up to a definitely<br />\nharmful degree.<br />\nSwallowing problems afflict<br />\nan entire range of age groups.<br />\nForty to fifty percent of all patients in nursing homes have<br />\nsome swallowing or feeding difficulties. These are mostly caused by brain damage resulting<br />\nfrom stroke and degenerating<br />\ndiseases which usually accompany old age.<br />\nThe younger segment of the<br />\npopulation may have swallowing problems arising from<br />\ndevelopmental, congenital abnormalities. Childhood diseases<br />\nsuch as cerebral palsy, could<br />\nresult in neurological problems<br />\nthroughout life. The \"sudden<br />\ndeath\" syndrome of infants has<br />\nbeen linked to swallowing<br />\ndisorders. Material from the<br />\nthe<br />\nobstructs<br />\nstomach<br />\nesophagus because of muscle<br /><br />\nfunction failures, thus causing<br />\nasphyxiation of the baby.<br />\nAt the present moment, Dr.<br />\nDonner comments that much<br />\nresearch is needed, especially in<br />\nthe diagnostic and rehabilitation areas. Because swallowing<br />\nproblems are so diverse and<br />\ndependent on the individual involved, there are no set rules<br />\nwhich correlate a set of symptoms with a particular cause.<br />\nSome very helpful diagnostic<br />\ntools currently in use and<br />\ndevelopment are the x-ray<br />\nmovie, electromyography, and<br />\na \"test kit.\" The test kit contains opaque substances of<br />\nvarying viscosity, elasticity and<br />\ntexture which can be picked up<br />\nby an x-ray. Thus, the problem<br />\ncan be more clearly defined by<br />\nseeing how each of these opaque substances act at different<br />\npoints in the swallowing<br />\nprocess.<br />\nSome rehabilitation techniques include assorted head<br />\nand neck positions which aid a<br />\nperson in swallowing. Lying<br />\ndown or elevating the lungs<br />\nseem to help aspiration and prevent food from descending the<br />\nwrong pipe.<br />\nDr. Donner stresses the fact<br />\nthat evaluating a swallowing<br />\ndifficulty is a multi-disciplinary<br />\napproach.

Lee<br />\nThis past Saturday, the Lady<br />\nHarriers concluded their spectacular 1985 season with a 6th<br />\nplace finish at the prestigious<br />\nNCAA division III Mid-East<br />\nChampionship Meet. Due to<br />\nthe storms weather, this race<br />\nhad minimal semblance to a<br />\ncross country meet. Instead it<br />\nwas more like an organized<br />\nmud-sliding competition.<br />\nLeaving for Allentown College, the site of this year's meet,<br />\nthe Lady Jays were well-fed, in<br />\ngood spirits, and in possession<br />\nof a full tank of gas. Unfortunately, many of the Jays lacked<br />\nthe proper clothing for what<br />\nwas to be a nasty day at the<br />\nraces.<br />\nThe reason for the team's improper attire was the result of<br />\na capricious Mother Nature.<br />\nFrom the time the Lady Jays<br />\nleft a warm and sunny<br />\nBaltimore, till the start of the<br />\nrace, the situation drastically<br />\nchanged. Temperatures dropped to near freezing and the sky<br />\nblackened, emitting an<br />\namalgamation of rain, sleet and<br />\nsnow. This tranformed the<br />\nAllentown course into one of<br />\nthe finest mud-sliding facilities<br />\non the East Coast. According<br />\nto Harrier coach Gary Green,<br />\nthe course had a stretch of<br />\n\"two miles of mud\" as \"the<br />\ngrass just disappeared.\"<br />\nWith the last minute changes<br />\nin weather, there was a shared<br />\nsentiment that this would not<br />\nbe a fun race to run. Maybe a<br />\nblast to watch, but definitely<br /><br />\nnot to run. Watching the runners line up for the start of the<br />\nrace, the coaches knew this race<br />\nwould be different. Looking<br />\ntres sportif in his Nehru coat,<br />\nFranklin and Marshall's coach,<br />\nChuck Studly expected a<br />\n\"bizarre race.\"<br />\nThe start of the race was the<br />\nstart of a 3.1-mile nightmare.<br />\nAs the runners covered the<br />\ncourse, they were engulfed in<br />\nthe screams of their helpless<br />\npeers. Through the slippery<br />\nmud, runners began falling, and<br />\nin attempts to regain balance,<br />\ngrabbed the nearest solid object. Unluckily, these objects<br />\noften turned out to be other<br />\nrunners whose balances were<br />\nalready precarious. The result<br />\nwas a horror show. In spite of<br />\ntheir previous surefootedness,<br />\nthe Lady Jays were not to be<br />\nspared.<br />\nSenior Mureen Shea suffered<br />\na spiral fraction (a common<br />\nboxing injury) as she fell twice<br />\nduring the race. Running on,<br />\nShea finished 5th for the Jays<br />\nand 46th overall. What is<br />\nremarkable was Shea's ability<br />\nto finish the race with her<br />\ninjury.<br />\nFinishing first for the Jays<br />\nand 30th overall was frosh Molly Bardsley. Bardsley's only<br />\nserious setback came when she<br />\nslipped and somersaulted<br />\nthrough the air. Quickly regaining her senses, the competitive<br />\nBardsley was up quickly and<br />\nrunning. However, something<br />\nwas not right, too many competitors were passing her. It was<br />\nthen Bardsley realized she was<br />\nrunning in the wrong direction.<br /><br />\nChanging course, she raced in<br />\nto finish with a time of 21:31.<br />\nBehind Bardsley were Cecilia<br />\nKing, 35th overall in 21:48; a<br />\nrelatively unscathed Anita Kim,<br />\n37th overall in 21:51; Suzi<br />\nMcGinn 40th in 21:59; Shea in<br />\n22:14; Tami Oki 48th in 22:22<br />\nand Sindee Gazansky 75th in<br />\n24:48.<br />\nKudos are especially in order<br />\nfor Gozansky who suffered the<br />\nbeginning stages of hypothermic shock just to finish the<br />\nrace. A warm weather runner,<br />\nGozansky was most unprepared<br />\nfor the elements. Running the<br />\nrace with only her uniform and<br />\na pair of gloves, the exposed<br />\nparts of her body suffered<br />\nheavily. Upon finishing,<br />\nGozansky collapsed and was<br />\nonly fully revived after a long<br />\nhot shower.<br />\nAnother noteworthy performance was that of Anita Kim.<br />\nKim ran the relatively best race<br />\nof all the Jays finishing 3rd for<br />\nthe squad. This achievement<br />\nalong without falling once during the race led to much praise<br />\nEleanor<br />\nCoach<br />\nfrom<br />\nSimonsick.<br />\nOverall for the Jays, this has<br />\nbeen an outstanding season.<br />\nCoaches Simonsick and Green<br />\nrank this year's squad as the<br />\nbest ever in Hopkins history.<br />\nThe evidence to support this<br />\nclaim are the squad's final dual<br />\nmeet record of 11-2 and also the<br />\nsquad's high finish in large<br />\ncompetitions.<br />\nNext year's Harriers hope to<br />\ncontinue the standards of high<br />\nperformance set this year. It is<br />\nlikely that they will, as only two<br />\nmembers of the Magnificent<br />\nSeven are graduating, seniors<br />\nMaureen Shea and Tami Oki.<br />\nHopefully, the shoes of these<br />\ntwo talented runners will be filled<br />\nby returning Harriers and also<br /><br />\nrecruits from New Jersey and<br />\nother foreign countries.<br />\nIn the nearer future, coaches<br />\nGreen and Simonsick are looking forward to an awesome<br />\nspring track team as runners<br />\nBardsley, McGinn and Shea<br /><br />\nwill transfer their talents to the<br />\nsynthetic oval. For all involved,<br />\nthis has been a great season.<br />\nGood luck in future pursuits<br />\nand, in the words of Jay runner Hyonah Shin, let's get<br />\n\"psyched for next year.\"<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nHERE'S AN IDEATHAT<br />\nCOULD MEAN...<br />\n_<br />\n61'\"it ,<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n.onh<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n0011111111<br /><br />\n7P<br />\n'.<br />\nA<br /><br />\n...<br /><br />\nill lif<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n,-:<br /><br />\nMONEY IN<br />\nYOUR POCKET '<br />\n,<br />\ni<br />\ni<br /><br />\nNeed some Christmas green?<br />\nEvery time you make a purchase<br />\nat the Open House from now to<br />\nDecember 10, you can enter our<br />\ndrawing.
