WARREN<br />\n<br />\nIn the life of nearly every man there are moments which<br />\nare worth months or even years of the humdrum routine of existence. Usually preceded by long periods of hard work and solid<br />\nachievement, and remembered after the long intervening gaps are<br />\nforgotten, they are the moments which make life really worth<br />\nliving. Supreme among undergraduate triumphs at Hopkins, and<br />\nperhaps unsurpassed by any in later life, are the emotions which<br />\ncrowd upon each man who is called to walk up the aisle of the<br />\nAssembly Hall to receive the laurel leaf of Omicron Delta Kappa.<br />\nFor 0. D. K. represents the best in undergraduate life,<br />\nwhether it be in scholarships, athletics, or non-athletic activities,<br />\nor, above all, in one's relations with his fellow man. The man<br />\nwho is admitted to membership has succeeded; he has received<br />\nthe most sought after college honor, and has gained an opportunity for still broader service to the University. The NEWSLETTER wishes to congratulate the six men who were chosen yesterday. They were wisely selected. Each in his own way has<br />\ngiven his best to Hopkins. Each one by his achievements and by<br />\nthe spirit in which he has carried on his work has proved himself worthy of that old Greek symbol of victory\u2014the laurel leaf.<br />\n<br />\nTHE SWIMMING TEAM<br />\nFrom a front page article in the last issue of the NEWSLETTER, together with a wretched picture which looked more like<br />\na Bhudda of some third-rate Oriental artist than the stalwart<br />\ncaptain of the swimming team whose name was beneath it, we<br />\nlearn that the swimming team is, still very much in existence, and<br />\nis planning an ambitious schedule.<br />\nThe swimming team deserves support because swimming is<br />\nthe one winter sport of Hopkins, if for no other reason. There<br />\nare, however, a great many other reasons. Teams in the past<br />\nhave been successful, even though they have usually picked strong<br />\nopponents. Prospects for this year look exceptionally bright.<br />\nAside from the question of winning or losing meets, swimming<br />\nis interesting to the spectator, or at least we have found it so.<br />\nWe always have enjoyed watching the mermen splashing up and<br />\ndown the pool, even though we have been considerably drenched<br />\nby the spray on several occasions. To round off the evening, the<br />\ndances which follow the meets have in the past proved enjoyable.<br />\nThe team does not receive a very large sum from the Athletic<br />\nAssociation; it depends to a large extent to the attendance at<br />\nhome meets. If the students want swimming, and we feel that<br />\nthey do, the only way to show this interest is to support the home<br />\nmeets.<br />\n<br />\nbresents this ad.<br />\n<br />\nScalp Treatment<br />\n1203 N.

WARREN<br /><br />\nIn the life of nearly every man there are moments which<br />\nare worth months or even years of the humdrum routine of existence. Usually preceded by long periods of hard work and solid<br />\nachievement, and remembered after the long intervening gaps are<br />\nforgotten, they are the moments which make life really worth<br />\nliving. Supreme among undergraduate triumphs at Hopkins, and<br />\nperhaps unsurpassed by any in later life, are the emotions which<br />\ncrowd upon each man who is called to walk up the aisle of the<br />\nAssembly Hall to receive the laurel leaf of Omicron Delta Kappa.<br />\nFor 0. D. K. represents the best in undergraduate life,<br />\nwhether it be in scholarships, athletics, or non-athletic activities,<br />\nor, above all, in one's relations with his fellow man. The man<br />\nwho is admitted to membership has succeeded; he has received<br />\nthe most sought after college honor, and has gained an opportunity for still broader service to the University. The NEWSLETTER wishes to congratulate the six men who were chosen yesterday. They were wisely selected. Each in his own way has<br />\ngiven his best to Hopkins. Each one by his achievements and by<br />\nthe spirit in which he has carried on his work has proved himself worthy of that old Greek symbol of victory\u2014the laurel leaf.<br /><br />\nTHE SWIMMING TEAM<br />\nFrom a front page article in the last issue of the NEWSLETTER, together with a wretched picture which looked more like<br />\na Bhudda of some third-rate Oriental artist than the stalwart<br />\ncaptain of the swimming team whose name was beneath it, we<br />\nlearn that the swimming team is, still very much in existence, and<br />\nis planning an ambitious schedule.<br />\nThe swimming team deserves support because swimming is<br />\nthe one winter sport of Hopkins, if for no other reason. There<br />\nare, however, a great many other reasons. Teams in the past<br />\nhave been successful, even though they have usually picked strong<br />\nopponents. Prospects for this year look exceptionally bright.<br />\nAside from the question of winning or losing meets, swimming<br />\nis interesting to the spectator, or at least we have found it so.<br />\nWe always have enjoyed watching the mermen splashing up and<br />\ndown the pool, even though we have been considerably drenched<br />\nby the spray on several occasions. To round off the evening, the<br />\ndances which follow the meets have in the past proved enjoyable.<br />\nThe team does not receive a very large sum from the Athletic<br />\nAssociation; it depends to a large extent to the attendance at<br />\nhome meets. If the students want swimming, and we feel that<br />\nthey do, the only way to show this interest is to support the home<br />\nmeets.<br /><br />\nbresents this ad.<br /><br />\nScalp Treatment<br />\n1203 N.
