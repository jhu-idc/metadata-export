Pfeffer was denied a tenured<br />\nprofessorship by the Political Science Department (PSD).<br />\nDr. Pfeffer appealed to the Academic Council (AC) for<br />\nthe formation of an adhoccommittee which would solicit<br />\nevaluative letters. from experts in his field. His request for<br />\nsuch a committee was strongly supported by students past<br />\nand present (a petition was submitted with 400 student<br />\nnames), professors (many of which are department<br />\nchairmen and former members of the AC), experts in<br />\nAsian Studies (including John S. Service, Moss Roberts,<br />\nand Noam Chomsky)and other members of the Baltimore<br />\nCommunity including Michael J. Kelly (Dean of the Univ.<br />\nof Maryland Law School) and Parren J. Mitchell (U.S.<br />\nCongressmen).<br />\nDuring last semester the AC considered the case and<br />\nheard the arguments presented by the PSD why Dr.<br />\nPfeffer was not granted tenure. Dr. Robert Tucker,<br />\nChairman of the PSD, explained in detail the<br />\ndepartment's ostensible motivation for their decision.<br />\nExactly what Dr. Tucker said at the AC meeting is, of<br />\ncourse, unknown since the proceedings are secret and<br />\ninformation of this nature is deleted from the AC<br />\nminutes. In mid-May the AC voted not to form the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee which would have given Dr. Pfeffer a chance<br />\nfor outside review.<br />\nRight now there are three probably explanations for<br />\nthe PSD's decision. It is either the quality, the quantity,<br />\nor the nature of Dr. Pfeffer's scholarship, or any<br />\npermutation there of. There is also a fourth possible<br />\nreason, which is his teaching ability.<br />\nBefore anything else is said, it must be pointed out that<br />\nthe book manuscript which was at the center of the<br />\nPfeffer case was just that, a manuscript. The title of the<br />\nmanuscript is Working For Capitalism. It was at the time<br />\nof the tenure procedures unfinished, unpublished, but<br />\naccepted for publication by two reputable presses.<br />\nNevertheless, the ms did not then satisfy Dr. Pfeffer's own<br />\nstandard of scholarship.<br />\nIn speaking with members of the AC time after time I<br />\nheard that the quality of Dr. Pfeffer's ms was the real<br />\nproblem. I asked AC members if they had read the rps and<br />\neach of them said no, except for one who had read it and<br />\nsaid \"it was very good and definitely merited the<br />\nformation of an ad hoc committee.\" As far as I know the<br />\nAC member who liked the ms is the only AC member<br />\nwho read it. When AC members were asked how they<br />\nknew the ms was of low quality without reading it, they<br />\nsaid \"they were told so by the PSD and they believed<br />\ntheir evaluation.\" It's as if the PSD words were gospel.<br />\nTwo questions emerge: Is the PSD's decision really a<br />\nprofessional evaluation? And are there any biases inherent<br />\nin their decision? At the outset it is safely said that<br />\nnobody in the PSD can be considered professionally<br />\ncompetent to evaluate work done on China, Marxism, or<br />\nCapitalism. No one writes or teaches in matters even<br />\ndistantly related to these areas.<br />\n<br />\nAs far as biases or subjective feelings being involved in<br />\nthe department's \"professional\" decision, members of the<br />\nAC that I have spoken to have assured me this is not<br />\npossible. I can hardly believe that the AC is naive enough<br />\nto believe that these professors did not let their feelings<br />\ntoward Dr. Pfeffer influence their decision. It is no secret<br />\nthat Dr. Pfeffer's unconventional ways irked many<br />\nmembers of the PSD and at least several members simply<br />\ndo not like him. Apparently Pfeffer caused these faculty<br />\nmembers problems and possibly unconsciously they saw a<br />\nway to get rid of him and to get an assistant professor for<br />\nthe department who would operate as a member of 'the<br />\nclub' and study and teach what he was supposed to.<br />\nIn summing Up this section, it appears that there is at<br />\nleast real doubt as to whether the quality of the ins was<br />\nevaluated professionally and objectively. Dr. Pfeffer has<br />\nspent this past summer revising his ins and it is scheduled<br />\nfor publication by the prestigious Columbia University<br />\nPress, whose reader called it \"a very valuable contribution<br />\nto the field.\" One would think that the ms might very<br />\nwell be good scholarship. The only way to fairly<br />\ndetermine the quality of the ms is for an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to be formed which would obtain opinions<br />\nfrom experts in Dr. Pfeffer's fields.<br />\n\u2022 Many people talk about Dr. Pfeffer's ms as if it is the<br />\nonly piece of work he's done since his last promotion to<br />\nassociate professor in 1972. Dr. Jack Green of the AC,for<br />\nexample, gave me the impression that Dr. Pfeffer had<br />\ndone little else besides the ms since '72. Maybe this is<br />\nwhat most members of the community think, but his<br />\nisn't true. Dr. Pfeffer in fact has published nine articles<br />\nsince his last promotion, five of which could be<br />\nconsidered scholarly even by members of his own<br />\ndepartment (see list of publications).<br />\nOne professor I talked to said \"the nine articles he has<br />\nwritten since 1972 should have been enough to warrant<br />\ntenure.\"<br />\nIn this light it seems that the PSD ignored the quantity<br />\nof Dr. Pfeffer's work because such productivity would<br />\nseem to demand the convoking of an ad hoc committee if<br />\nnot tenure itself.<br />\nDr. Richard Cone who has been working on Dr.<br />\nPfeffer's behalf, has concisely described Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nwork. He said: \"The nature of Dr. Pfeffer's scholarship is<br />\nconsistent with the nature of his other contributions to<br />\nthe University: it is activist, provocative, and sometimes<br />\npolemical. it is, as well, responsbiel, honest, and<br />\ninsistently directed at fundamental questions and<br />\nconcepts of Maoism, Marxism, and Capitalism as pi _aced<br />\nin China and in the United States.\" The nature of Dr.<br />\nPfeffer's,/ ork may well be the real reason why he was<br />\ngranted tenure. His scholarship is not Political Science as<br />\nthe PSD sees it. No tenured members of the PSD are<br />\nprofessionally interested in Marxism, Asia, or related<br />\nareas. By constrast, an AC member who supported Dr.<br />\nPfeffer said: \"Sooner or late people in the U.S. are going<br />\nto wake up and realize that there are eight hundred<br />\nmillion people in China and it might be an important<br />\nplace to study.\"To a large extent some professors in the<br />\nPSD work in an intellectual vacuum. They look at<br />\nquestions or do research in areas where they know their<br />\ncolleagues' interests lie. Dr. Pfeffer has stepped outstide<br />\n<br />\nGot your clubs together?<br />\n<br />\nof this cozy little world and is looking at questions 01<br />\nlarger importance to society. Ile is questioning the very<br />\nprinciples upon which the American political system is<br />\nfounded. Before we look at questions within the<br />\nAmerican political system, Pfeffer demands we ask<br />\nquestions about the system as a whole.<br />\nPfeffer's case raises the question, of what the<br />\nUniversity's purpose is in America. One would think that<br />\nthe University should look at grand questions as well as<br />\nnarrower ones. It should be responsive to the needs of<br />\npeople, not simply as fashions and conventions dictate,<br />\nand not as certain small segmented groups of specialists<br />\nsee them. In view of Dr. Pfeffer's valuable contributions<br />\nto the University, the formation of an ad hoc committee<br />\nis certainly merited.<br />\nIt is common knowledge that Dr. Pfeffer is an<br />\nexcellent teacher. He had been rated by the Student<br />\nCourse Guide as on of the top ten professors on campus.<br />\nHe has a unique ability to motivate his students to think<br />\ncritically and analytically. He trains his students not to<br />\naccept anything at face value; he demands thorough<br />\nintellectual investigation of all ideas, concepts, and<br />\nsystems discussed in class. This is a rare class room<br />\nexperience at Hopkins. Too many professors at<br />\nHopkins are quite content with a less questioning<br />\ntreatment of any subject matter.<br />\nOne may wonder whether Dr. Pfeffer's teaching<br />\nexcellence in fact may not have adversely affected his<br />\ntenure proceedings. An AC member speculating on the<br />\nPSD's decision said \"I felt it was not based on their<br />\nhostility to his Marxist viewpoint, but on his popularity<br />\nwith undergraduates and the Hopkins Community. I felt<br />\ntheir decision was based on jealousy.\" He goes on to say<br />\n\"How long will the university ignore undergraduate<br />\neducation? Someday the university will realize that<br />\nUndergraduate education is not of third or fourth<br />\nimportance.\" It is quite possible that members of the PSD<br />\ndislike Dr. Pfeffer because he is popular.<br />\nRelatedly Dr. Richard Cone said \"If a professor is a<br />\nvery good teacher, it is a forgone conclusion he is a bad<br />\nscholar in his field. It's hard for faculty members to<br />\nimagine that a professor who is an excellent teacher could<br />\nposssibly be a leading scholar in his field. How can he do<br />\nboth? Clearly he must flitter away all his time with<br />\nstudents.\" Dr. Cone further stated that \"Professors often<br />\nare frightened away from teaching because they are<br />\nchallenged by an audience of students and they worry<br />\nabout their performance.\" Perhaps this is why the quality<br />\nof a professor's teaching is not given effective<br />\nconsideration during tenure procedures.<br />\nIn conclusion, after looking at the evidence I think the<br />\npast a decision was narrowminded at best. The AC is<br />\nresponsible for the well being of the whole university and<br />\nshould look at issues from the point of view of the well<br />\nbeing of the entire Hopkins Community and not from<br />\nthat of a small part; i.e. the PSD.But the most important<br />\nreason why Dr. Pfeffer should get an ad hoc committee is<br />\nwhat David Chesanow (Student Council President) said in<br />\nlast week's Newsletter: \"It is a fundamental tenet of<br />\nAmerican and all other civilized systems of jurisprudence<br />\nthat one is entitled to appeal a court decision which he<br />\ndeems unjust.\"<br />\nDue<br />\nThe question remains, Will Dr. Pfeffer get<br />\nProcess?

The cut-outs were<br />\ncreated by cutting a variety of shapes from large sheets of<br />\npaper painted with opaque water-colors. Matisse viewed<br />\nthe cut-out as \"the simplest and most direct way to<br />\nexpress myself.\" He felt that they linked \"drawing and<br />\ncolor in a single movement.\"<br />\nFirst using this mode in planning the murals for the<br />\nBarnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania in the 1930s,<br />\nMatisse continu9d to work with cut-outs until his death in<br />\n1954. While working on his book, Jazz, from 1943 to<br />\n1947, Matisse returned to the cut-out method. Cut-puts<br />\nwere also employed in designing robes, windows and<br />\nother items for the Chapel of St. Paul de Vence, which<br />\nMatisse created in celebration of his recovery from a<br />\nserious illness.<br />\nMatisse was influenced both by Eastern and tropical<br />\nmotifs. His suite at the Regina hotel in Nice was<br />\nfestooned with textiles, ceramics, screens, and flowers;<br />\nthe colors and forms of the Mediterranean and Nice came<br />\nthrough his window as well, Photographs of Matisse's<br />\nstudio can be seen throughout the exhibition.<br />\nThe earliest cut-out in the show,La Danse, executed in<br />\n1938, recalls the large painting pf a circle of dancers at<br />\nthe Museum of Modern Art. However, the colors are<br />\ndarker than those in the later canvases.<br />\nThe largL pieces are spectacular homages to color and<br />\nlight. Polynesie, le Ciel (Polynesia, the Sky), of 1946,is a<br />\nlight blue and lavender checkerboard ornamented by a<br />\ncrenalated edge and white shapes. Grand Decoration aux<br />\nMasques (1953) depjcts two masks ,on either side of a<br />\ndivider and is enclosed between two columns at either end<br />\nof the canvas. Flowers are scattered about in brilliant<br />\n...profusion.<br />\n<br />\nComposition Croix Rouge .and Composition Fond Vert,<br />\nboth of 1947, arc abstractions that convey Mediterranean<br />\ninfluence. In Croix Rouge, the coloring consists of an<br />\nintense red cross filled in with blue and black on a red<br />\nbackground and white field; the whole is somewhat<br />\nreminiscent of the chasubles done for the chapel at<br />\n<br />\nVence. Composition Fond Vert displays many of the<br />\ntendencies of the Mediterranean motif, with its<br />\nsuggestions of seaweeds and ferns.<br />\nThe later cut-outs are largely blue and white and deal<br />\nwith the female form. La Piscine, a border made to<br />\nsurround a room, is perhaps the most monumental of<br />\nthese works. The figures are very sensual and reveal a<br />\ngreater mastery as the years progress. They are a<br />\ntestimony to the versatility and force of the colors.<br />\nPerhaps the crowning achievement of Matisse's career<br />\nwas the chapel he designed at Vence. The stained glass for<br />\nthe chapel is represented at the show by Tree of Life<br />\n(1949). The cut-outs, now housed at the Vatican, depict<br />\nboth a tree and a leaf motif. Matisse also designed<br />\nchasubles to be worn by the celebrants during the Mass;<br />\nthose at the show are red with black and yellow crosses.<br />\nThe installation is a vital part of an exhibit, and<br />\nparticularly so in the Matisse show, as the works - clearly<br />\nsuperb in any setting - should be displayed to their best<br />\nadvantage. The signs at the show are spectacular in blue<br />\nand white, the colors of the Midi of Matisse's world, as is<br />\nthe green of the plants.<br />\n\u2022The room size is altered tc the scale of the works<br />\ndisplayed. The beige walls and smaller rooms constructed<br />\nwithin the building's structure create a smaller space,<br />\nmatching the scale of the early works and allowing them<br />\nto explode within the smaller space. The larger works are<br />\ngiven the full benefit of high ceilings and separate rooms,<br />\nas is the case with ivegr!sse and Grande Decoration aux<br />\nMasques, which share a large room. There are long<br />\ncorridors and extended paths of vision so that the viewer<br />\nis able to stand back and examine a particularly<br />\ncompelling work.<br />\nThe treatment of works is altered, however, when the<br />\nneed arises. The blue and white cut-outs, for example, are<br />\ntreated differently. More intimate and personal works,<br />\nwith the human figure as their subject, are in rooms which<br />\nare once again smaller; the resulting intimacy is<br />\neightened by carpeting and tawny wall-coloring. The<br />\ntained glass from Vence is installed in a sunken white<br />\noom while a white baseboard rises in front of the works.<br />\nhis gives one the impression of standing in a chapel in<br />\nhich the windows soar from the floor.<br />\nStatements by Matisse describing his work with the<br />\ncut-outs have been stencilled onto the walls of the<br />\nexhibition. Matisse noted that \"colors have a beauty of<br />\ntheir own which must be preserved, as one strives to<br />\npreserve the tonal quality in music.\" The show at the<br />\nNational Gallery bears witness to the success of his<br />\nendeavor., it pays homage to Matisse's peat and joyous<br />\nspirit and his brilliant works.<br />\n<br />\nT.V.'s New Season: Sex Fiends & Bubbleheads<br />\nBY MIKE DEAK<br />\n<br />\naccurately reflect reality, nobody<br />\nwould bother to watch.

In casting the part of the country priest,<br />\nBresson first eliminated all non-believers, then interviewed<br />\naround one hundred candidates before selecting Laydu,<br />\nwho at the age of twenty four had never made a film,<br />\nalthough he had done some theatrical acting. What<br />\nfollowed was a year of weekly sessions between Bresson<br />\nand Laydu, at the end of which time Laydu had,in effect,<br />\nbecome the country priest. His performance, like nearly<br />\nevery performance in a Bresson film, is a perfect fusion of<br />\nactor and role. While preparing for his role, Laydu lived<br />\nwith a group of young priests, ate little in order to appear<br />\nemaciated and wore the cassocks of a r9a1 otiest.<br />\n<br />\nShot on location, with a nonprofessional cast, Diary of<br />\na Country Priest has the appearance of unadorned reality.<br />\nBresson sought to eliminate from the film any suggestion<br />\nof acting, because .he considers acting \"a bastard art,\".<br />\nsomething for the theater. \"An actor, even (and above all)<br />\na talented actor, gives us too simple an image of a human<br />\nbeing, and therefore a false image .... We are complex.<br />\nAnd what the actor projects is not complex.\"<br />\nBresson's \"actors\" have untheatrical. nonexpressive<br />\nfaces, and they often speak in a steady monotone.<br />\nBresson hopes, through such techniques, to bring about<br />\nautomatic, as opposed to theatrical, performances from<br />\nhis cast: \"It is not so much a question of doing 'nothing'<br />\nas some people have said. It is rather a question of<br />\nperforming without being aware of oneself, of not<br />\ncontrolling oneself. Experience has proved to me that<br />\nwhen I was the most 'automatic' in my work, I was the<br />\nmost moving.\"<br />\nBecause Laydu has a blank face and rarely speaks,<br />\nhj cluvacters in th; film are of ek unable to<br />\n<br />\ndiary of a<br />\ncountry<br />\npriest<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nwas so disappointed-, ?Tad to-Tean against the door.\"\u2014His<br />\ndisappointment is presented through sound and image.<br />\nBresson removes any objects or sounds which would<br />\ninterfere with the one impression he wants to convey.<br />\nWhen the priest is writing in his diary, we 'see his<br />\nhandwriting as it covers a blank page, and we hear the<br />\npriest's interior narration, which emphasizes the same<br />\nwords that are being set down on the page. Again,sound<br />\nand visual image (in this case written image) express the<br />\nsame ideas and emotions. The effect can be, indeed<br />\nalmost must be, overpowering, because there is virtually<br />\nnothing else to occupy the viewer's attention.<br />\nThe priest's isolation is largely self-imposed, but<br />\nwhether or not he has dedicated himself to a course of<br />\nself-martyrdom, i.e. whether or not he ends his life and<br />\nthe film as a saint, is a question which a viewer must<br />\nconfront for himself. Whether the priest succumbs to his<br />\nenvironment or transcends it is not a question that<br />\nBresson is going to answer in Bodoni Bold across the final<br />\ni nue ajross.<br />\n<br />\nDI<br />\n<br />\nNINIMOININRION~I<br />\n<br />\ncommunicate with -- much less understand -- him. As an<br />\nexample, toward the end of the film, when it is obvious<br />\nthat the cure's illness is serious, he is asked \"What's the<br />\nmatter? ... Answer!,\" but he never does answer. His<br />\nphysical illness, stomach cancer,like his spiritual journey<br />\nis internal, unseen, and often undetected by the other<br />\ncharacters. Bresson, in interviews, has stated his belief<br />\nthat all true drama is internal.<br />\nThe audience, however, has some access to the interior<br />\nmonologue, the internal drama, of the young priest,<br />\nbecause in Diary ofa Country Priest, as in A Man Escaped<br />\nand Pickpocket, Bresson makes extensive use of interior<br />\nnarration. The priest's deadpan narration, though, rather<br />\nthan adding valuable new information, often does no<br />\nmore than reinforce what we have already seen. Rather<br />\nthan boring or irritating the viewer, Bresson's narrative<br />\ntechnique has a powerful effect. Sometimes it serves to<br />\nemphasize a character's relation to the physical objects<br />\naround him. For instance, after a door has closed and the<br />\nnest has alread leaned a ainst it we hear his voice: \"I<br />\nwon't be playing until January 25-26, so there's still<br />\nplenty of time to purchase that ticket. Another concert<br />\nwhich may be sold out in advance is when Jean-Pierre<br />\nRampal comes to the Lyric on March 22-23.<br />\nIf all those famous flutists, violinists and such seem<br />\npretty exciting, don't forget one of the most exciting<br />\nfeatures of all, maestro Sergiu Comissiona. Since the<br />\nThe Baltimore Symphony Orchestra begins its 1977-78 Rumanian-born Comissiona has takeii the helm, the<br />\nseason this coming Wednesday, September 28, with a Baltirr,re Symphony has evolved from the depressingly<br />\nprogram of Barber's Prayers of Kierkegaard, Richard<br />\nmediocre outfit which it was for most of its history into<br />\nStrauss's Burleske in D minor, and Shostakovich's one of the five or six most respected orchestras on the<br />\nSymphony No. Ten.

In addition, there is a Friday \"Under Mr. Comissiona's training, the Baltimore<br />\nFavorites series of six concerts, which provides<br />\nconcertgoers with less \"heavy,\" more popular works, by<br />\ncomposers such as Tchaikovsky. A series of eight<br />\nSaturday concerts will feature crowd pleasers Cab<br />\nCalloway, Arthur Fiedler and Carlos Montoya.<br />\nAll concerts are at the Lyric Theater, which at 120W.<br />\nMount Royal Avenue, is easily reached by the number 3<br />\nand 11\u2022 bus lines. Large parking lots, directly across the<br />\nstreet from the theater, make concertgoing an<br />\nuncomplicated affair for those with cars. And the box<br />\noffice is only a phone call away at 837-5691.<br />\nOf special interest to students is the fact that they may<br />\npurchase season subscriptions to Wednesday, Thursday, or<br />\nFriday concerts at half price, on seats in certain parts of<br />\nthe Lyric. Students are also able to purchase 'Rush<br />\nTickets\" at half-price one-half-hour before Wednesday,<br />\nThursday, or Fridayconcerts. Two tickets are allowed for<br />\neach valid student ID card. Because the Symphony rarely<br />\nsells out, a student can usually buy tickets to a<br />\nperformance only minutes before concert time. One<br />\nexception, to this every year is the Isaac Stern concert,<br />\nwhich is nearly always sold out in advance. But Stern<br />\n<br />\nSymphony<br />\nStarts Wed.<br />\n<br />\nSymphony can be accounted one of the better American<br />\nensembles. Smooth and colorful strings; superior b,,lances:<br />\naccurate attacks and releases; first class soloplaying: the<br />\nBaltimore Symphony did itself proud.\"<br />\nSo,if the Baltimore Symphony ever had a reputation as<br />\na rather provincial ensemble, that's a thing of the past.<br />\nAlmost 10,000 people have subscribedt this year<br />\nand more are sure to join the list once the remodelling of<br />\nthe Lyric Theatre, which includes more comfortable seats<br />\nand air conditioning, is completed. But the beautiful<br />\ninterior architecture and world famous acoustics of the<br />\nLyric Theater will not be greatly changed, so that the<br />\nconcertgoers of tomorrow will still be hearing classical<br />\nmusic in the same concert hall in which Tchaikovsky<br />\nconducted and Enrico Caruso sang.<br />\n<br />\n\fLETTERS Cont.<br />\naccumulated but advertised such unfounded<br />\nprejudices to the Hopkins community.<br />\nStudents can always get together and pursue<br />\ndrinking, et cetera, at the Rathskellar. However, last<br />\nyear 175 freshmen found fraternities had much<br />\nmore to offer.<br />\nA side note: we noticed that the author wrongly<br />\ncalled a fraternity a 'frat.\" After all, would you call<br />\nyour country a \"----?\"<br />\n-Jim Restrepo,Pres.,DU<br />\nJeff Cribbs, V.Pres.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYour \"They're Having A Party\" editorial is an<br />\nexcellent example of yellow journalism. Firstly as to<br />\nyour charges of \"blatant sexism,\" if you ,were to<br />\nlook at pages four and fourteen of the same edition<br />\nof the News-Letter you would find two examples of<br />\nusing the mating urge to lure students to movies.<br />\nWhy is it that the News-Letter feels a need to resort<br />\nto such levels of inducement? The obvious answer is<br />\nthat such ads attact attention and get read. Getting<br />\nread is after all the purpose of posters put up by<br />\nanyone on campus. Such vehement objection to<br />\nexhibition of a naked back, and various puns, seems<br />\nto be inspired more by puritanical concerns than<br />\negalitarianism.<br />\nAs for your comment on fraternities being<br />\n\"exclusionist societies\" and therefore \"basically<br />\noppressive and chauvinistic,\" Johns Hopkins itself is<br />\nmuch more exclusionist than any fraternity could<br />\never hope to be. That would mean that your tuition<br />\nsupports an \"oppressive and chauvinistic\"<br />\nadministration. In which case your wrath should be<br />\ndirected towards Garland Hall and the admissions<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nThe purposes of fraternities on this campus are<br />\nmainly two. One is .to provide an atmosphere of<br />\nfriendship in .whicht to accomplish personal and<br />\ngroup objectives. The other is to be a social outlet<br />\nfor undergraduates. If in socialising one gets drunk<br />\nor high (or both), I see very little worth<br />\ncondemning. If by now at Homewood you have not<br />\nfelt the need for a social release from working<br />\npressures you are one of a very small minority.<br />\nYour editorial is in reality an attack on the<br />\n<br />\nSeptember 23, 1977/7.<br />\n<br />\nDU Cont.<br />\n<br />\nstereotypical image of fraternity life of the fifties.

To those in the armed<br />\nservices, the word might mean being shot at with blanks<br />\nand crawling through mud or going through drills for no<br />\nappreciable reason. The wargames here, however, are none<br />\nof the above.<br />\nSociety today rejects war as immoral, while adults<br />\nfrown upon games as childish and a waste or time. Hence,<br />\nthe combination of the two makes a wargamer feel<br />\nsomewhat socially unacceptable.(\"A wargamer? What are<br />\nyou, some kind of Nazi?\") Yet wargaming is an honored<br />\nand venerabll pastime, starting back in 700 AD with the<br />\npopularization of chess, or even further back in history<br />\nwhen one considers the ancient game of Go.<br />\nWhat are wargames, who makes them, and who plays<br />\nthem? Furthermore, what significance do they have in our<br />\nsociety?<br />\n<br />\nMany people are familiar with such popular games as<br />\nRisk or Stratego. Yet companies such as Milton Bradley<br />\noiParkerBrothers are not responsible for making games for<br />\na hobby which is reputedly the fastest growing hobby in<br />\nthe United States today. One of the largest, if not the<br />\nlargest of the companies that make simulations is the<br />\nAvalon Hill Company right here in Baltimore. Another is<br />\nSimulations Publications Incorporated in New York.<br />\nThere are more situated in Illinois, Arizona, California,<br />\netc., All these companies produce games at regular<br />\nintervals throughout the year, and these titles are then<br />\nsold to the public as any book would be.<br />\nWho is the public? Warmongers? Militarists? Red necks<br />\nor Hawks?<br />\nGamers are normal people who enjoy an occasional<br />\ndifferent type of entertainment. Unlike most hobbies,<br />\nhowever, gaming is not a solitary occupation and hence<br />\nmany clubs have sprouted up in the past decade. The JHU<br />\nHistorical Simulations Society is a group on campus<br />\nwhich meets every Saturday morning at ten o'clock in<br />\nMaryland 204 to relax, have some fun, play a game or<br />\ntwo, and, in general, get to know each other better.<br />\nInterest Group Baltimore is the citywide organization<br />\nworking in conjunction with Avalon Hill.<br />\nWargames, boardgames, or miniature battles offer a<br />\nchance for a person to compete and yet unwind at the<br />\nsame time. In today's pressure-cooker world, it seems odd<br />\nthat two or more adults should sit down and move<br />\ncardboard pieces around for a couple of hours on a<br />\ncolored piece of paper, and yet thousands of garners<br />\nthoroughly enjoy themselves at every club meeting or<br />\nwhenever they get a chance to play. These are adult games<br />\nand not childrens', and there is a difference.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\nWargames, or \"Historical Simulations\" as they are so<br />\n0<br />\ncleverly renamed, attempt to recreate history and, in<br />\n.<br />\nparticular, historical battles, through the use of a game<br />\nsystem. A game system usually means a board, pieces, and<br />\n,<br />\nrules. As a historian might wish to know about the battle<br />\nof Waterloo by reading a book on that subject, so may a<br />\nhistorian learn about the battle by playing a game of<br />\nWaterloo. As subject topics for books on history are ambrai<br />\n\u2022<br />\nunlimited,so are the number of topics for games.<br />\nIf a person knows little about the European Theater of<br />\nWorld War Two, what better way to gain quick and<br />\nincisive knowledge than by playing a game of Third Reich<br />\nOr, if one prefers biblical stories, there's<br />\nor WWII?<br />\nalways a game of Ancient Conquest to be played. In<br />\ngeneral, wargames are recreational ways of learning<br />\nhistory.<br />\nHowever, not all wargames deal with war. A<br />\n\"Classroom\" game, that is, one which is used as a teaching<br />\ndevice in many college and high school classes, often<br />\nsimulates business, political or ecological situations. I<br />\nOrigins of WWII, as an example, deals with the critical<br />\nf<br />\npre-war years of 1934 to 1939, when Hitler and Nazi<br />\nGermany achieved international prominence and the<br />\nevents were set in motion for the disasterous conflict to<br />\nfollow. A teacher can then explain to his class why<br />\nChamberlain failed to stop Hitler in the political battles at<br />\nMunich.<br />\nPerhaps, then, historical simulation is not a bad term<br />\nfor such games after all. Many businesses actually train<br />\nkey executives with economic simulations. But who<br />\ndesigns these games, and who prints them?<br />\n<br />\nTo the beginner, wargames seem very complex. In an<br />\nattempt to initiate those unsuspecting customers, certain<br />\ncompanies will purposely publish \"beginning\" games or<br />\nsimple style games. Some companies will print<br />\n\"complexity scales\" on their game covers; make no<br />\nmistake, some of them are very complex. But that's what<br />\nthe Historical Simulations Society is for, mainly, to<br />\ninitiate the uninitiated. Once\u2022 a person is iiied to the idea<br />\nof games that require thought, imagination, patience, and<br />\na little luck, then he is a true gamer and will never lose the<br />\nappreciation for games that he never had.<br />\nFor some hard facts about gaming, one should know<br />\nthat it started commercially in 1959 in Baltimore with<br />\nAvalon Hill, and now can boast a following of as many as<br />\nfifty to seventy five thousand. An interesting note about<br />\nthe composition of the members is that ninety five<br />\npercent of them are male.(While this is understandable in<br />\nthe light of womens' roles as they have been seen in the<br />\npast, it is the author's personal hope that more females<br />\nwill get interested in gaming.)<br />\nSo the next time a person says he plays wargames,<br />\ndon't shy away from him;instead, investigate. If you see a<br />\ngroup playing fantasy role-playing games in the Snack Bar<br />\nor Rathskellar, ask them what it's all about. If you prefer,<br />\ncontact me and I'll be glad to tell you more, but either<br />\nway check out a great new way to have fun and learn.<br />\n<br />\n\fSep.ember 23, 1977/11<br />\n<br />\nAllegro<br />\nma non troppo<br />\nBY J. D. CONSIDINE<br />\nWalking down Charles St. from the Washington<br />\nMonument, a young man who was standing at the bus<br />\nstop comes up. Mr. Prausnitz? Excuse me, Mr. Prausnitz?<br />\nCould I talk to you later today?\"<br />\nFrederik Prausnitz, with an international reputation as<br />\na conductor, impressive credentials as a modernist and<br />\nthe distinction of having won the AmericarBruckner<br />\nSociety's Gustave iMahler, medal, stopped, turned to the<br />\nstudent and !istened intently. As he said when we got<br />\nunderway, \"I hope you'll excuse me, but it's when they<br />\nstop coming up to me that I worry. Of course,\" he added<br />\nwryly, \"there will be times when they'll sec me coming<br />\nand walk across the street.\"<br />\nWe proceed, with scattered hellds and waves. \"You<br />\nrealize this has all been set up by the publicity<br />\ndepartment. and when we get to the end of the street, a<br />\npoliceman will come up and arrest me, and then you'll<br />\nhave no interview.\" He laughs, and one finds it difficult to<br />\ncoalesce the image of the stereotypical German<br />\nconductor, all furrowed brows and intense frowns, with<br />\nthe self-assured humor that propels thes conversation.<br />\nAs the interview finally gets underway, Prausnitz insists<br />\nthat, \"I'm going to be asking more questions of you than<br />\nyou'll ask me. I want to find out what's what with Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" But first things first, and he explains how it is<br />\nthat he puts the programs together.<br />\n\"Well, you see, we have a real advantage over another<br />\norchestra, like the Baltimore Symphony. Because they<br />\nhave only a certain number of services they can do in a<br />\nweek, be it rehearsals, concerts, benefits or whatever,<br />\nthere's only so much they can do in rehearsal. We will<br />\nhave more time, and I'm planning to do some really<br />\ndifferent things in rehearsal.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBecause the Peabody Orchestra is a learning experience<br />\nin addition to being a concert organisation, there seems to<br />\nbe more involved than just playing the music, in fact,<br />\nmore than just learning the basic repertory.<br />\n\"Some people say, 'Why don't you just start them off<br />\nwith something simple, like a Haydyn Symphony?' Why,I<br />\ncouldn't think of anything more difficult! There are such<br />\nmatters as getting the right sound. \"The orchestras then<br />\nwere small, yes, but with this particular symphony<br />\n(Symphony 86, to be performed at the Orchestra's<br />\nopening concert), one of the 'Paris' Symphonies, there<br />\nwere forty violins. Even then, though, the instruments<br />\n<br />\nwere different, and so maybe forty of their violins equal<br />\ntwenty of ours, we don't know.\"<br />\n\"But it's not just a question of scaling down the<br />\norchestra. There is a chord progression in that Symphony<br />\nwhich was very shocking in its day. Of course, today we<br />\ndon't find it at all unusual. So you must tell the orchestra,<br />\n'This is supposed to be a shock.'\"<br />\nPerhaps most startling among his ideas is the firm<br />\nconviction that the new music, particularly the new<br />\nAmerican music, must be played. \"In Germany, we would<br />\nplay a lot of German music, some of which wouldn't be<br />\nplayed over here. Over here, a lot of German music gets<br />\nplayed (some of which wouldn't be played over there),<br />\nbutnot much American music.\"<br />\nIf only because the students are living now, it should be<br />\neasier for them to relate, to understand modern music.<br />\nAnd, says Prausnitz, it is going to be the repertoire a<br />\nmusician will be expected to know.\"Unlike a professional<br />\norchestra, we have the time to go over these techniques.<br />\nIn a professional orchestra, the conductor expects the<br />\nmusicians to be able to play the new music. They don't<br />\nwant to have to g9 over it (the new techniques) with the<br />\norchestra.\"<br />\nOf course, not every musician is as receptive to the new<br />\nmusic as Pausnitz. In fact, quite a few young musicians<br />\nwould prefer to ignore it. \"Students tend to be very<br />\nconservative, and you really can't blame them. They have<br />\ntheir whole life ahead of them; why should they want to<br />\ntake chances?\" He smiles. \"At my age, I can. afford to...\"<br />\nComing to Baltimore from London, afrer.a career that<br />\nput him in almost every major city in Europe, Prausnitz is<br />\nstill somewhat amazed by how much there is in<br />\nBaltimore. \"I had heard, of course, about the Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nSymphony, Hopkins, and Peabody, but I had no idea<br />\nthere was this mucli! Why the Walters alone....I was at the<br />\nMechanic last night, to see Golda Baltimore,is really very<br />\nlucky to have the theatre, and even with its problems, it's<br />\nin as good a shape as most theatres. But to get first run<br />\nperformances of such quality plays... \"There are places I<br />\nhaven't been to yet, but it's not because I'm not<br />\ninterested', it's just that there's so much!\" This helps the<br />\nartistic climate in Baltimore, and even the Peabody<br />\nOrchestra. \"If things are good for the theatre, things are<br />\ngood for music.\"<br />\nSurprisingly, what interested Prausnitz most was what<br />\nHopkins was up to. \"I see this as a great opportunity .for<br />\nboth schools.\" But how to get the Hopkins students<br />\ninvolved?<br />\nwant to do something along the lines of the<br />\nRug concerts Boulez did in New York, but do it in such a<br />\nway as to interest the people who wouldn't normally<br />\ncome to concerts.\" How about music and computers?<br />\n\"Yes, I'd thought of that; do music using computers. Who<br />\nwould be good to talk to about that?\" Names are<br />\nmentioned, scrawled on a notepad for future<br />\nconsultation. Other topics come up: Music in Film. Music<br />\nand Logic, Music and Joyce. \"One thing I would like to<br />\ngo into,\" says Prausnitz, \"is the concept of music and<br />\ntime relations. Is there anyone in the math or perhaps<br />\nphysics departments who would be good to talk to?<br />\nAs it approaches the hour of departure (Prausnitz must<br />\nmeet with his Orchestra manager), Prausnitz excuses<br />\nhimself, saying \"I told you I'd ask you more than. you'd<br />\nask me.\" Perhaps, but even so, Frederik Prausnitz is one<br />\nof those rare souls who can tell you as much in a question<br />\nas others could in an a.lswer.<br />\n<br />\n\f12/News-Letter, Vol. 82, no. 4<br />\n<br />\nnot only running against:'the* 'crdss-7cOunf6i:15ut' also \u2018give's-lifs Where I Watitt cOMpetinThrit<br />\nother team, but aloagainst your all for the track team in the right now, it's less than an<br />\nown team members.\"<br />\nspring. \"In track there is more optimal race if I don't win.

The<br />\ninitial disturbances were<br />\nthoroughly annoying and<br />\nabusive, but Dr. Ballentine<br />\nignored them at first. However,<br />\nwhen the callers persisted, he<br />\ntook the matter to Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate Studies Sigmund<br />\nSuskind.<br />\nAfter meeting, they asked for<br />\nthe assistance of the phone<br />\ncompany in placing a tracer on<br />\nProfessor Ballentine's line. In<br />\nApril, during another of the<br />\nmidnight calls, the phone<br />\nCompany successfully traced the<br />\nconnection to an extension in the<br />\nDelta Upsilon (DU) Fraternity<br />\nhouse. Shortly thereafter, a court<br />\norder was obtained and a tap was<br />\ninstalled on the DU phone line.<br />\nIn the meantime, Dean<br />\nSuskind decided to confront DU<br />\npresident William Lauerman with<br />\nthe evidence. On April 22, he<br />\nmet Mr. Lauerman alone, and<br />\nfour days later he and Dr.<br />\nBallentine played tapes for the<br />\nfrat chief which the Professor had<br />\nrecorded during several of the<br />\ncalls.

Curiously, except for the letter defending sexism, all<br />\nthe mail defending the Frat System came from Fraternity<br />\nPresidents or brothers.

If \"frat\" is an unacceptable term, we suggest<br />\nthey advise S.C. President (and Fraternity member) David<br />\nChesanow.

Pfeffer was denied a tenured<br />\nprofessorship by the Political Science Department (PSD).<br />\nDr. Pfeffer appealed to the Academic Council (AC) for<br />\nthe formation of an adhoccommittee which would solicit<br />\nevaluative letters. from experts in his field. His request for<br />\nsuch a committee was strongly supported by students past<br />\nand present (a petition was submitted with 400 student<br />\nnames), professors (many of which are department<br />\nchairmen and former members of the AC), experts in<br />\nAsian Studies (including John S. Service, Moss Roberts,<br />\nand Noam Chomsky)and other members of the Baltimore<br />\nCommunity including Michael J. Kelly (Dean of the Univ.<br />\nof Maryland Law School) and Parren J. Mitchell (U.S.<br />\nCongressmen).<br />\nDuring last semester the AC considered the case and<br />\nheard the arguments presented by the PSD why Dr.<br />\nPfeffer was not granted tenure. Dr. Robert Tucker,<br />\nChairman of the PSD, explained in detail the<br />\ndepartment's ostensible motivation for their decision.<br />\nExactly what Dr. Tucker said at the AC meeting is, of<br />\ncourse, unknown since the proceedings are secret and<br />\ninformation of this nature is deleted from the AC<br />\nminutes. In mid-May the AC voted not to form the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee which would have given Dr. Pfeffer a chance<br />\nfor outside review.<br />\nRight now there are three probably explanations for<br />\nthe PSD's decision. It is either the quality, the quantity,<br />\nor the nature of Dr. Pfeffer's scholarship, or any<br />\npermutation there of. There is also a fourth possible<br />\nreason, which is his teaching ability.<br />\nBefore anything else is said, it must be pointed out that<br />\nthe book manuscript which was at the center of the<br />\nPfeffer case was just that, a manuscript. The title of the<br />\nmanuscript is Working For Capitalism. It was at the time<br />\nof the tenure procedures unfinished, unpublished, but<br />\naccepted for publication by two reputable presses.<br />\nNevertheless, the ms did not then satisfy Dr. Pfeffer's own<br />\nstandard of scholarship.<br />\nIn speaking with members of the AC time after time I<br />\nheard that the quality of Dr. Pfeffer's ms was the real<br />\nproblem. I asked AC members if they had read the rps and<br />\neach of them said no, except for one who had read it and<br />\nsaid \"it was very good and definitely merited the<br />\nformation of an ad hoc committee.\" As far as I know the<br />\nAC member who liked the ms is the only AC member<br />\nwho read it. When AC members were asked how they<br />\nknew the ms was of low quality without reading it, they<br />\nsaid \"they were told so by the PSD and they believed<br />\ntheir evaluation.\" It's as if the PSD words were gospel.<br />\nTwo questions emerge: Is the PSD's decision really a<br />\nprofessional evaluation? And are there any biases inherent<br />\nin their decision? At the outset it is safely said that<br />\nnobody in the PSD can be considered professionally<br />\ncompetent to evaluate work done on China, Marxism, or<br />\nCapitalism. No one writes or teaches in matters even<br />\ndistantly related to these areas.<br /><br />\nAs far as biases or subjective feelings being involved in<br />\nthe department's \"professional\" decision, members of the<br />\nAC that I have spoken to have assured me this is not<br />\npossible. I can hardly believe that the AC is naive enough<br />\nto believe that these professors did not let their feelings<br />\ntoward Dr. Pfeffer influence their decision. It is no secret<br />\nthat Dr. Pfeffer's unconventional ways irked many<br />\nmembers of the PSD and at least several members simply<br />\ndo not like him. Apparently Pfeffer caused these faculty<br />\nmembers problems and possibly unconsciously they saw a<br />\nway to get rid of him and to get an assistant professor for<br />\nthe department who would operate as a member of 'the<br />\nclub' and study and teach what he was supposed to.<br />\nIn summing Up this section, it appears that there is at<br />\nleast real doubt as to whether the quality of the ins was<br />\nevaluated professionally and objectively. Dr. Pfeffer has<br />\nspent this past summer revising his ins and it is scheduled<br />\nfor publication by the prestigious Columbia University<br />\nPress, whose reader called it \"a very valuable contribution<br />\nto the field.\" One would think that the ms might very<br />\nwell be good scholarship. The only way to fairly<br />\ndetermine the quality of the ms is for an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to be formed which would obtain opinions<br />\nfrom experts in Dr. Pfeffer's fields.<br />\n\u2022 Many people talk about Dr. Pfeffer's ms as if it is the<br />\nonly piece of work he's done since his last promotion to<br />\nassociate professor in 1972. Dr. Jack Green of the AC,for<br />\nexample, gave me the impression that Dr. Pfeffer had<br />\ndone little else besides the ms since '72. Maybe this is<br />\nwhat most members of the community think, but his<br />\nisn't true. Dr. Pfeffer in fact has published nine articles<br />\nsince his last promotion, five of which could be<br />\nconsidered scholarly even by members of his own<br />\ndepartment (see list of publications).<br />\nOne professor I talked to said \"the nine articles he has<br />\nwritten since 1972 should have been enough to warrant<br />\ntenure.\"<br />\nIn this light it seems that the PSD ignored the quantity<br />\nof Dr. Pfeffer's work because such productivity would<br />\nseem to demand the convoking of an ad hoc committee if<br />\nnot tenure itself.<br />\nDr. Richard Cone who has been working on Dr.<br />\nPfeffer's behalf, has concisely described Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nwork. He said: \"The nature of Dr. Pfeffer's scholarship is<br />\nconsistent with the nature of his other contributions to<br />\nthe University: it is activist, provocative, and sometimes<br />\npolemical. it is, as well, responsbiel, honest, and<br />\ninsistently directed at fundamental questions and<br />\nconcepts of Maoism, Marxism, and Capitalism as pi _aced<br />\nin China and in the United States.\" The nature of Dr.<br />\nPfeffer's,/ ork may well be the real reason why he was<br />\ngranted tenure. His scholarship is not Political Science as<br />\nthe PSD sees it. No tenured members of the PSD are<br />\nprofessionally interested in Marxism, Asia, or related<br />\nareas. By constrast, an AC member who supported Dr.<br />\nPfeffer said: \"Sooner or late people in the U.S. are going<br />\nto wake up and realize that there are eight hundred<br />\nmillion people in China and it might be an important<br />\nplace to study.\"To a large extent some professors in the<br />\nPSD work in an intellectual vacuum. They look at<br />\nquestions or do research in areas where they know their<br />\ncolleagues' interests lie. Dr. Pfeffer has stepped outstide<br /><br />\nGot your clubs together?<br /><br />\nof this cozy little world and is looking at questions 01<br />\nlarger importance to society. Ile is questioning the very<br />\nprinciples upon which the American political system is<br />\nfounded. Before we look at questions within the<br />\nAmerican political system, Pfeffer demands we ask<br />\nquestions about the system as a whole.<br />\nPfeffer's case raises the question, of what the<br />\nUniversity's purpose is in America. One would think that<br />\nthe University should look at grand questions as well as<br />\nnarrower ones. It should be responsive to the needs of<br />\npeople, not simply as fashions and conventions dictate,<br />\nand not as certain small segmented groups of specialists<br />\nsee them. In view of Dr. Pfeffer's valuable contributions<br />\nto the University, the formation of an ad hoc committee<br />\nis certainly merited.<br />\nIt is common knowledge that Dr. Pfeffer is an<br />\nexcellent teacher. He had been rated by the Student<br />\nCourse Guide as on of the top ten professors on campus.<br />\nHe has a unique ability to motivate his students to think<br />\ncritically and analytically. He trains his students not to<br />\naccept anything at face value; he demands thorough<br />\nintellectual investigation of all ideas, concepts, and<br />\nsystems discussed in class. This is a rare class room<br />\nexperience at Hopkins. Too many professors at<br />\nHopkins are quite content with a less questioning<br />\ntreatment of any subject matter.<br />\nOne may wonder whether Dr. Pfeffer's teaching<br />\nexcellence in fact may not have adversely affected his<br />\ntenure proceedings. An AC member speculating on the<br />\nPSD's decision said \"I felt it was not based on their<br />\nhostility to his Marxist viewpoint, but on his popularity<br />\nwith undergraduates and the Hopkins Community. I felt<br />\ntheir decision was based on jealousy.\" He goes on to say<br />\n\"How long will the university ignore undergraduate<br />\neducation? Someday the university will realize that<br />\nUndergraduate education is not of third or fourth<br />\nimportance.\" It is quite possible that members of the PSD<br />\ndislike Dr. Pfeffer because he is popular.<br />\nRelatedly Dr. Richard Cone said \"If a professor is a<br />\nvery good teacher, it is a forgone conclusion he is a bad<br />\nscholar in his field. It's hard for faculty members to<br />\nimagine that a professor who is an excellent teacher could<br />\nposssibly be a leading scholar in his field. How can he do<br />\nboth?

The cut-outs were<br />\ncreated by cutting a variety of shapes from large sheets of<br />\npaper painted with opaque water-colors. Matisse viewed<br />\nthe cut-out as \"the simplest and most direct way to<br />\nexpress myself.\" He felt that they linked \"drawing and<br />\ncolor in a single movement.\"<br />\nFirst using this mode in planning the murals for the<br />\nBarnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania in the 1930s,<br />\nMatisse continu9d to work with cut-outs until his death in<br />\n1954. While working on his book, Jazz, from 1943 to<br />\n1947, Matisse returned to the cut-out method. Cut-puts<br />\nwere also employed in designing robes, windows and<br />\nother items for the Chapel of St. Paul de Vence, which<br />\nMatisse created in celebration of his recovery from a<br />\nserious illness.<br />\nMatisse was influenced both by Eastern and tropical<br />\nmotifs. His suite at the Regina hotel in Nice was<br />\nfestooned with textiles, ceramics, screens, and flowers;<br />\nthe colors and forms of the Mediterranean and Nice came<br />\nthrough his window as well, Photographs of Matisse's<br />\nstudio can be seen throughout the exhibition.<br />\nThe earliest cut-out in the show,La Danse, executed in<br />\n1938, recalls the large painting pf a circle of dancers at<br />\nthe Museum of Modern Art. However, the colors are<br />\ndarker than those in the later canvases.<br />\nThe largL pieces are spectacular homages to color and<br />\nlight. Polynesie, le Ciel (Polynesia, the Sky), of 1946,is a<br />\nlight blue and lavender checkerboard ornamented by a<br />\ncrenalated edge and white shapes. Grand Decoration aux<br />\nMasques (1953) depjcts two masks ,on either side of a<br />\ndivider and is enclosed between two columns at either end<br />\nof the canvas. Flowers are scattered about in brilliant<br />\n...profusion.<br /><br />\nComposition Croix Rouge .and Composition Fond Vert,<br />\nboth of 1947, arc abstractions that convey Mediterranean<br />\ninfluence. In Croix Rouge, the coloring consists of an<br />\nintense red cross filled in with blue and black on a red<br />\nbackground and white field; the whole is somewhat<br />\nreminiscent of the chasubles done for the chapel at<br /><br />\nVence. Composition Fond Vert displays many of the<br />\ntendencies of the Mediterranean motif, with its<br />\nsuggestions of seaweeds and ferns.<br />\nThe later cut-outs are largely blue and white and deal<br />\nwith the female form. La Piscine, a border made to<br />\nsurround a room, is perhaps the most monumental of<br />\nthese works. The figures are very sensual and reveal a<br />\ngreater mastery as the years progress. They are a<br />\ntestimony to the versatility and force of the colors.<br />\nPerhaps the crowning achievement of Matisse's career<br />\nwas the chapel he designed at Vence. The stained glass for<br />\nthe chapel is represented at the show by Tree of Life<br />\n(1949). The cut-outs, now housed at the Vatican, depict<br />\nboth a tree and a leaf motif. Matisse also designed<br />\nchasubles to be worn by the celebrants during the Mass;<br />\nthose at the show are red with black and yellow crosses.<br />\nThe installation is a vital part of an exhibit, and<br />\nparticularly so in the Matisse show, as the works - clearly<br />\nsuperb in any setting - should be displayed to their best<br />\nadvantage. The signs at the show are spectacular in blue<br />\nand white, the colors of the Midi of Matisse's world, as is<br />\nthe green of the plants.<br />\n\u2022The room size is altered tc the scale of the works<br />\ndisplayed. The beige walls and smaller rooms constructed<br />\nwithin the building's structure create a smaller space,<br />\nmatching the scale of the early works and allowing them<br />\nto explode within the smaller space. The larger works are<br />\ngiven the full benefit of high ceilings and separate rooms,<br />\nas is the case with ivegr!sse and Grande Decoration aux<br />\nMasques, which share a large room. There are long<br />\ncorridors and extended paths of vision so that the viewer<br />\nis able to stand back and examine a particularly<br />\ncompelling work.<br />\nThe treatment of works is altered, however, when the<br />\nneed arises. The blue and white cut-outs, for example, are<br />\ntreated differently. More intimate and personal works,<br />\nwith the human figure as their subject, are in rooms which<br />\nare once again smaller; the resulting intimacy is<br />\neightened by carpeting and tawny wall-coloring. The<br />\ntained glass from Vence is installed in a sunken white<br />\noom while a white baseboard rises in front of the works.<br />\nhis gives one the impression of standing in a chapel in<br />\nhich the windows soar from the floor.<br />\nStatements by Matisse describing his work with the<br />\ncut-outs have been stencilled onto the walls of the<br />\nexhibition. Matisse noted that \"colors have a beauty of<br />\ntheir own which must be preserved, as one strives to<br />\npreserve the tonal quality in music.\" The show at the<br />\nNational Gallery bears witness to the success of his<br />\nendeavor., it pays homage to Matisse's peat and joyous<br />\nspirit and his brilliant works.<br /><br />\nT.V.'s New Season: Sex Fiends &amp; Bubbleheads<br />\nBY MIKE DEAK<br /><br />\naccurately reflect reality, nobody<br />\nwould bother to watch.

In casting the part of the country priest,<br />\nBresson first eliminated all non-believers, then interviewed<br />\naround one hundred candidates before selecting Laydu,<br />\nwho at the age of twenty four had never made a film,<br />\nalthough he had done some theatrical acting. What<br />\nfollowed was a year of weekly sessions between Bresson<br />\nand Laydu, at the end of which time Laydu had,in effect,<br />\nbecome the country priest. His performance, like nearly<br />\nevery performance in a Bresson film, is a perfect fusion of<br />\nactor and role. While preparing for his role, Laydu lived<br />\nwith a group of young priests, ate little in order to appear<br />\nemaciated and wore the cassocks of a r9a1 otiest.<br /><br />\nShot on location, with a nonprofessional cast, Diary of<br />\na Country Priest has the appearance of unadorned reality.<br />\nBresson sought to eliminate from the film any suggestion<br />\nof acting, because .he considers acting \"a bastard art,\".<br />\nsomething for the theater. \"An actor, even (and above all)<br />\na talented actor, gives us too simple an image of a human<br />\nbeing, and therefore a false image .... We are complex.<br />\nAnd what the actor projects is not complex.\"<br />\nBresson's \"actors\" have untheatrical. nonexpressive<br />\nfaces, and they often speak in a steady monotone.<br />\nBresson hopes, through such techniques, to bring about<br />\nautomatic, as opposed to theatrical, performances from<br />\nhis cast: \"It is not so much a question of doing 'nothing'<br />\nas some people have said. It is rather a question of<br />\nperforming without being aware of oneself, of not<br />\ncontrolling oneself. Experience has proved to me that<br />\nwhen I was the most 'automatic' in my work, I was the<br />\nmost moving.\"<br />\nBecause Laydu has a blank face and rarely speaks,<br />\nhj cluvacters in th; film are of ek unable to<br /><br />\ndiary of a<br />\ncountry<br />\npriest<br />\n-<br /><br />\nwas so disappointed-, ?Tad to-Tean against the door.\"\u2014His<br />\ndisappointment is presented through sound and image.<br />\nBresson removes any objects or sounds which would<br />\ninterfere with the one impression he wants to convey.<br />\nWhen the priest is writing in his diary, we 'see his<br />\nhandwriting as it covers a blank page, and we hear the<br />\npriest's interior narration, which emphasizes the same<br />\nwords that are being set down on the page. Again,sound<br />\nand visual image (in this case written image) express the<br />\nsame ideas and emotions. The effect can be, indeed<br />\nalmost must be, overpowering, because there is virtually<br />\nnothing else to occupy the viewer's attention.<br />\nThe priest's isolation is largely self-imposed, but<br />\nwhether or not he has dedicated himself to a course of<br />\nself-martyrdom, i.e. whether or not he ends his life and<br />\nthe film as a saint, is a question which a viewer must<br />\nconfront for himself. Whether the priest succumbs to his<br />\nenvironment or transcends it is not a question that<br />\nBresson is going to answer in Bodoni Bold across the final<br />\ni nue ajross.<br /><br />\nDI<br /><br />\nNINIMOININRION~I<br /><br />\ncommunicate with -- much less understand -- him. As an<br />\nexample, toward the end of the film, when it is obvious<br />\nthat the cure's illness is serious, he is asked \"What's the<br />\nmatter? ... Answer!,\" but he never does answer. His<br />\nphysical illness, stomach cancer,like his spiritual journey<br />\nis internal, unseen, and often undetected by the other<br />\ncharacters. Bresson, in interviews, has stated his belief<br />\nthat all true drama is internal.<br />\nThe audience, however, has some access to the interior<br />\nmonologue, the internal drama, of the young priest,<br />\nbecause in Diary ofa Country Priest, as in A Man Escaped<br />\nand Pickpocket, Bresson makes extensive use of interior<br />\nnarration. The priest's deadpan narration, though, rather<br />\nthan adding valuable new information, often does no<br />\nmore than reinforce what we have already seen. Rather<br />\nthan boring or irritating the viewer, Bresson's narrative<br />\ntechnique has a powerful effect. Sometimes it serves to<br />\nemphasize a character's relation to the physical objects<br />\naround him. For instance, after a door has closed and the<br />\nnest has alread leaned a ainst it we hear his voice: \"I<br />\nwon't be playing until January 25-26, so there's still<br />\nplenty of time to purchase that ticket.

The obvious answer is<br />\nthat such ads attact attention and get read. Getting<br />\nread is after all the purpose of posters put up by<br />\nanyone on campus. Such vehement objection to<br />\nexhibition of a naked back, and various puns, seems<br />\nto be inspired more by puritanical concerns than<br />\negalitarianism.<br />\nAs for your comment on fraternities being<br />\n\"exclusionist societies\" and therefore \"basically<br />\noppressive and chauvinistic,\" Johns Hopkins itself is<br />\nmuch more exclusionist than any fraternity could<br />\never hope to be.

To those in the armed<br />\nservices, the word might mean being shot at with blanks<br />\nand crawling through mud or going through drills for no<br />\nappreciable reason. The wargames here, however, are none<br />\nof the above.<br />\nSociety today rejects war as immoral, while adults<br />\nfrown upon games as childish and a waste or time. Hence,<br />\nthe combination of the two makes a wargamer feel<br />\nsomewhat socially unacceptable.(\"A wargamer? What are<br />\nyou, some kind of Nazi?\") Yet wargaming is an honored<br />\nand venerabll pastime, starting back in 700 AD with the<br />\npopularization of chess, or even further back in history<br />\nwhen one considers the ancient game of Go.<br />\nWhat are wargames, who makes them, and who plays<br />\nthem? Furthermore, what significance do they have in our<br />\nsociety?<br /><br />\nMany people are familiar with such popular games as<br />\nRisk or Stratego. Yet companies such as Milton Bradley<br />\noiParkerBrothers are not responsible for making games for<br />\na hobby which is reputedly the fastest growing hobby in<br />\nthe United States today. One of the largest, if not the<br />\nlargest of the companies that make simulations is the<br />\nAvalon Hill Company right here in Baltimore. Another is<br />\nSimulations Publications Incorporated in New York.<br />\nThere are more situated in Illinois, Arizona, California,<br />\netc., All these companies produce games at regular<br />\nintervals throughout the year, and these titles are then<br />\nsold to the public as any book would be.<br />\nWho is the public? Warmongers? Militarists? Red necks<br />\nor Hawks?<br />\nGamers are normal people who enjoy an occasional<br />\ndifferent type of entertainment. Unlike most hobbies,<br />\nhowever, gaming is not a solitary occupation and hence<br />\nmany clubs have sprouted up in the past decade. The JHU<br />\nHistorical Simulations Society is a group on campus<br />\nwhich meets every Saturday morning at ten o'clock in<br />\nMaryland 204 to relax, have some fun, play a game or<br />\ntwo, and, in general, get to know each other better.<br />\nInterest Group Baltimore is the citywide organization<br />\nworking in conjunction with Avalon Hill.<br />\nWargames, boardgames, or miniature battles offer a<br />\nchance for a person to compete and yet unwind at the<br />\nsame time. In today's pressure-cooker world, it seems odd<br />\nthat two or more adults should sit down and move<br />\ncardboard pieces around for a couple of hours on a<br />\ncolored piece of paper, and yet thousands of garners<br />\nthoroughly enjoy themselves at every club meeting or<br />\nwhenever they get a chance to play. These are adult games<br />\nand not childrens', and there is a difference.<br /><br />\n0<br />\nWargames, or \"Historical Simulations\" as they are so<br />\n0<br />\ncleverly renamed, attempt to recreate history and, in<br />\n.<br />\nparticular, historical battles, through the use of a game<br />\nsystem. A game system usually means a board, pieces, and<br />\n,<br />\nrules. As a historian might wish to know about the battle<br />\nof Waterloo by reading a book on that subject, so may a<br />\nhistorian learn about the battle by playing a game of<br />\nWaterloo. As subject topics for books on history are ambrai<br />\n\u2022<br />\nunlimited,so are the number of topics for games.<br />\nIf a person knows little about the European Theater of<br />\nWorld War Two, what better way to gain quick and<br />\nincisive knowledge than by playing a game of Third Reich<br />\nOr, if one prefers biblical stories, there's<br />\nor WWII?<br />\nalways a game of Ancient Conquest to be played. In<br />\ngeneral, wargames are recreational ways of learning<br />\nhistory.<br />\nHowever, not all wargames deal with war. A<br />\n\"Classroom\" game, that is, one which is used as a teaching<br />\ndevice in many college and high school classes, often<br />\nsimulates business, political or ecological situations. I<br />\nOrigins of WWII, as an example, deals with the critical<br />\nf<br />\npre-war years of 1934 to 1939, when Hitler and Nazi<br />\nGermany achieved international prominence and the<br />\nevents were set in motion for the disasterous conflict to<br />\nfollow. A teacher can then explain to his class why<br />\nChamberlain failed to stop Hitler in the political battles at<br />\nMunich.<br />\nPerhaps, then, historical simulation is not a bad term<br />\nfor such games after all. Many businesses actually train<br />\nkey executives with economic simulations. But who<br />\ndesigns these games, and who prints them?<br /><br />\nTo the beginner, wargames seem very complex. In an<br />\nattempt to initiate those unsuspecting customers, certain<br />\ncompanies will purposely publish \"beginning\" games or<br />\nsimple style games. Some companies will print<br />\n\"complexity scales\" on their game covers; make no<br />\nmistake, some of them are very complex. But that's what<br />\nthe Historical Simulations Society is for, mainly, to<br />\ninitiate the uninitiated. Once\u2022 a person is iiied to the idea<br />\nof games that require thought, imagination, patience, and<br />\na little luck, then he is a true gamer and will never lose the<br />\nappreciation for games that he never had.<br />\nFor some hard facts about gaming, one should know<br />\nthat it started commercially in 1959 in Baltimore with<br />\nAvalon Hill, and now can boast a following of as many as<br />\nfifty to seventy five thousand. An interesting note about<br />\nthe composition of the members is that ninety five<br />\npercent of them are male.(While this is understandable in<br />\nthe light of womens' roles as they have been seen in the<br />\npast, it is the author's personal hope that more females<br />\nwill get interested in gaming.)<br />\nSo the next time a person says he plays wargames,<br />\ndon't shy away from him;instead, investigate. If you see a<br />\ngroup playing fantasy role-playing games in the Snack Bar<br />\nor Rathskellar, ask them what it's all about. If you prefer,<br />\ncontact me and I'll be glad to tell you more, but either<br />\nway check out a great new way to have fun and learn.<br /><br />\nSep.ember 23, 1977/11<br /><br />\nAllegro<br />\nma non troppo<br />\nBY J. D. CONSIDINE<br />\nWalking down Charles St. from the Washington<br />\nMonument, a young man who was standing at the bus<br />\nstop comes up. Mr. Prausnitz? Excuse me, Mr. Prausnitz?<br />\nCould I talk to you later today?\"<br />\nFrederik Prausnitz, with an international reputation as<br />\na conductor, impressive credentials as a modernist and<br />\nthe distinction of having won the AmericarBruckner<br />\nSociety's Gustave iMahler, medal, stopped, turned to the<br />\nstudent and !istened intently. As he said when we got<br />\nunderway, \"I hope you'll excuse me, but it's when they<br />\nstop coming up to me that I worry. Of course,\" he added<br />\nwryly, \"there will be times when they'll sec me coming<br />\nand walk across the street.\"<br />\nWe proceed, with scattered hellds and waves. \"You<br />\nrealize this has all been set up by the publicity<br />\ndepartment. and when we get to the end of the street, a<br />\npoliceman will come up and arrest me, and then you'll<br />\nhave no interview.\" He laughs, and one finds it difficult to<br />\ncoalesce the image of the stereotypical German<br />\nconductor, all furrowed brows and intense frowns, with<br />\nthe self-assured humor that propels thes conversation.<br />\nAs the interview finally gets underway, Prausnitz insists<br />\nthat, \"I'm going to be asking more questions of you than<br />\nyou'll ask me. I want to find out what's what with Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" But first things first, and he explains how it is<br />\nthat he puts the programs together.<br />\n\"Well, you see, we have a real advantage over another<br />\norchestra, like the Baltimore Symphony. Because they<br />\nhave only a certain number of services they can do in a<br />\nweek, be it rehearsals, concerts, benefits or whatever,<br />\nthere's only so much they can do in rehearsal. We will<br />\nhave more time, and I'm planning to do some really<br />\ndifferent things in rehearsal.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBecause the Peabody Orchestra is a learning experience<br />\nin addition to being a concert organisation, there seems to<br />\nbe more involved than just playing the music, in fact,<br />\nmore than just learning the basic repertory.<br />\n\"Some people say, 'Why don't you just start them off<br />\nwith something simple, like a Haydyn Symphony?' Why,I<br />\ncouldn't think of anything more difficult! There are such<br />\nmatters as getting the right sound. \"The orchestras then<br />\nwere small, yes, but with this particular symphony<br />\n(Symphony 86, to be performed at the Orchestra's<br />\nopening concert), one of the 'Paris' Symphonies, there<br />\nwere forty violins. Even then, though, the instruments<br /><br />\nwere different, and so maybe forty of their violins equal<br />\ntwenty of ours, we don't know.\"<br />\n\"But it's not just a question of scaling down the<br />\norchestra. There is a chord progression in that Symphony<br />\nwhich was very shocking in its day. Of course, today we<br />\ndon't find it at all unusual. So you must tell the orchestra,<br />\n'This is supposed to be a shock.'\"<br />\nPerhaps most startling among his ideas is the firm<br />\nconviction that the new music, particularly the new<br />\nAmerican music, must be played. \"In Germany, we would<br />\nplay a lot of German music, some of which wouldn't be<br />\nplayed over here. Over here, a lot of German music gets<br />\nplayed (some of which wouldn't be played over there),<br />\nbutnot much American music.\"<br />\nIf only because the students are living now, it should be<br />\neasier for them to relate, to understand modern music.<br />\nAnd, says Prausnitz, it is going to be the repertoire a<br />\nmusician will be expected to know.\"Unlike a professional<br />\norchestra, we have the time to go over these techniques.<br />\nIn a professional orchestra, the conductor expects the<br />\nmusicians to be able to play the new music. They don't<br />\nwant to have to g9 over it (the new techniques) with the<br />\norchestra.\"<br />\nOf course, not every musician is as receptive to the new<br />\nmusic as Pausnitz. In fact, quite a few young musicians<br />\nwould prefer to ignore it. \"Students tend to be very<br />\nconservative, and you really can't blame them. They have<br />\ntheir whole life ahead of them; why should they want to<br />\ntake chances?\" He smiles. \"At my age, I can. afford to...\"<br />\nComing to Baltimore from London, afrer.a career that<br />\nput him in almost every major city in Europe, Prausnitz is<br />\nstill somewhat amazed by how much there is in<br />\nBaltimore. \"I had heard, of course, about the Baltimore<br /><br />\nSymphony, Hopkins, and Peabody, but I had no idea<br />\nthere was this mucli! Why the Walters alone....I was at the<br />\nMechanic last night, to see Golda Baltimore,is really very<br />\nlucky to have the theatre, and even with its problems, it's<br />\nin as good a shape as most theatres.
