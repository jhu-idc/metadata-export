Baker, Jr., A. B.'92,<br />\nMayor of Cleveland.<br />\n<br />\nAssociation of New York and New Jersey<br />\nHolds First Blow-Out at<br />\nChemists' Club.<br />\n<br />\nH. Findlay French, secretary of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Endowment and<br />\nExtension Fund Committee, states<br />\nthat the _committee will meet soon<br />\nto formulate plans for securing the<br />\nrest of the $2,00D,00D necessary to<br />\nremove the University buildings to<br />\nHomewood. Approximately $1,200,003 of this amount is already<br />\npledged. He said, \"There has been<br />\nno meeting of the committee this<br />\nfall, but the members will soon convene, to decide how the remaining<br />\n$800,0oo will be secured. It is<br />\nPractically certain that we shall endeavor to collect this amount outside of the city from philanthropists<br />\nand others interested in the welfare<br />\nof the University. We shall not<br />\nappeal to Baltimoreans as a whole,<br />\nbut if there are any citizens who<br />\nwould like to help in the extension<br />\n`A.Trk, we shall welcome their subscriptions. As for the actual building at Homewood, no work will be<br />\ndone this winter. Corps of men<br />\nhave been grading the tract,of -land<br />\nthis summer and some foundations<br />\nhave been marked off. This work<br />\nwill be resumed in the spring. The<br />\nBuilding Committee has been enlarged in order to make the work<br />\nmore systematic, and they have already made some definite plans but<br />\ndo not wish to announce just what<br />\nthese plans are until later.<br />\n\"To work on the committees necessitates a great sacrifice of personal business. During the local<br />\ncampaign last winter the members<br />\nof the committee left their business<br />\nfor days at a time and it meant a<br />\ngreat loss to them. This is probably the reason why they have not<br />\nYet gotten to work. However, we<br />\nshall soon meet and set out to complete the fund.\"<br />\nSome persons interested in the<br />\nOn to Homewood\" movement are<br />\nOf the opinion that<br />\nthe State of<br />\nMaryland should complete the fund.<br />\nThey point out the fact that in<br />\n1910, the Commonwealth of Wisconsin gave $1,196,500 for extension work and improvements at the<br />\nstate university at Madison; and<br />\nalso that Michigan and Nebraska<br />\nannually give $640,000 and $565.000, respectively, to their state universities. It is true that Johns Hopkins is not a state university, but<br />\nthere are persons who still think<br />\nthe State of Maryland should complete the fund.<br />\nB. Howell Griswold, chairman of<br />\nthe committee,<br />\nstated last Friday<br />\nl'at no substantial increases had<br />\n)een made in the<br />\nfund.<br />\n<br />\nOf the seven alumni on the State<br />\nand city tickets, in the recent election, Hopkins men will be glad to<br />\nsee that four were elected. At first<br />\nsight this may seem a very small<br />\nnumber, but one must remember<br />\nhow very few college or professional men run for the State Legislature. Indeed, this has been one<br />\nof the crying needs of the State<br />\nfor many years. Probably several<br />\nyears ago we would have been .fortunate to have one or two of our<br />\nalumni among the law Makers,<br />\nwhereas, now we have four. The<br />\nsuccessful alumni were as follows:<br />\nWilliam H. Maltbie, Ph. D.

Va. He received the degree of Bachelor of<br />\nArts in 1892, and, after a year's<br />\npest-graduate work here, went to<br />\nWashing-ton and Lee, where, in<br />\n1894, he got the LL. B. degree.<br />\nThe next two years were spent as<br />\nprivate secretary to PostmasterGeneral Wilson. Then after practicing law for several years at Martinsburg, he moved to Cleveland,<br />\n0., where he resumed the practice<br />\nof law.<br />\nHe was a professor in. the Baldwin University of Ohio, and City<br />\nSolicitor of Cleveland. Here he<br />\nbecame one of the lieutenants of<br />\nthe late Tom L. Johnson. On Tuesday last Ile was elected mayor of<br />\nCleveland, and had the honor of receiving the largest plurality(17,000)<br />\na candidate has ever received. Mr.<br />\nBaker declared the result was \"a<br />\nmonument to the late Tom L. Johnson.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Association of Johns Hopkins Alumni of New York and New<br />\nersey held their first smoker Wednesday night at the Chemists' Club<br />\nin New York City. There were a<br />\nnumber of ex-Hopkins men present,<br />\nand Charles A. Boston, president<br />\nof the Association, spoke on Johns<br />\nHopkins men and what they are<br />\ndoing.<br />\n\"We all know,\" he said, \"of the<br />\nwork of Dr. Simon Flexner in investigating what we commonl<br />\nknow as infantile paralysis; of Dr.<br />\nAbraham Flexner, his brother, who<br />\nattracted attention because of his<br />\nreport on the defects of professional<br />\nschools to the Carnegie Institution,<br />\nand of Dr. Canby Robinson and<br />\nhis plans for the Rockefeller Hospital.

The size of the score<br />\nindicates nothing of the fierceness<br />\nof the contest. The Hopkins team<br />\nmade a splendid fight, and the<br />\nstruggle, from start to finish, was<br />\nfull of vim.<br />\nThe game started off quick and<br />\nsnappy. Gillet kicked off. After considerable punting, in which 'Virginia<br />\nhad a decided advantage, the winners punted to Hopkins'5-yard line,<br />\nand after a fierce struggle, managed<br />\nto push the ball over for the first<br />\ntouchdown. Yeager kicked goal.<br />\nThe punting continued and the first<br />\nquarter ended with no further<br />\nchange in score.<br />\nVirginia began the second quarter<br />\nwith a rush. Through the failure<br />\noi a forward pass, Hopkins secured<br />\nthe ball on its 5-yard line, and Fulton punted to the 40-yard line.<br />\nHere Todd, of Virginia, caught it<br />\nand broke through the Hopkins.<br />\nline for a second touchdown. Yeager<br />\nkicked goal.<br />\nAt the beginning of the third<br />\nquarter, Yeager, of Virginia, caught<br />\none of Gillet's forward passes and<br />\nran 40 yards to make a touchdown.<br />\nHe kicked goal. Another punting<br />\nduel ensued in the course of which<br />\nVirginia made a touchback. Hopkins attempted several poorly executed forward passes, and the<br />\nVirginians made their fourth touchdown. No goal was kicked. At<br />\nthis point Hopkins woke up for<br />\nan instant. Gillet made 10 yards,<br />\nPieper, To; Branham, io; Pieper,<br />\n10 more, and Dodson, 10<br />\nHopkins braced up again at the<br />\nbeginning of the last quarter, but<br />\nsoon lost the ball on an attempted<br />\nforward pass, and Virginia rushed<br />\nit\"down the field for a touchdown.<br />\nDavidson missed the goal. The<br />\nlast touchdown, also, Virginia carried by storm. Gillet had kicked<br />\noff to Virginia's I-yard line. In<br />\ntwo plays, Virginia brought the ball<br />\nto Hopkins' 35-yard line, and in the<br />\nnext play put it over. Goal was<br />\nkicked. The rest of the game was<br />\na listless sparring against time.<br />\nNo part of the defeat can be<br />\ncharged to the Hopkins rooters.<br />\nUnder the able leadership of Freddie<br />\nLee, they did their duty well, yelling when the team was gaining and<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 13, 1911.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nThe News=Letter<br />\nFOUNDED, 1897.<br />\nSUBSCRIPTION :<br />\n<br />\n$1.50 per year.<br />\nEntered<br />\ncember 3,<br />\nBaltimore,<br />\nNovember<br />\n<br />\n5 cents per copy.<br />\n<br />\nas second class matter De1909, at the Post Office at<br />\nMd., under Act of Congress,<br />\n3, 1879.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Published weekly from October to<br />\nJune by the undergraduates of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER;<br />\nall articles and other cominunications<br />\nshould be sent to the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.<br />\nTelephone,<br />\n<br />\n- - -<br />\n<br />\nMt.

Findlay French, secretary of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Endowment and<br />\nExtension Fund Committee, states<br />\nthat the _committee will meet soon<br />\nto formulate plans for securing the<br />\nrest of the $2,00D,00D necessary to<br />\nremove the University buildings to<br />\nHomewood. Approximately $1,200,003 of this amount is already<br />\npledged. He said, \"There has been<br />\nno meeting of the committee this<br />\nfall, but the members will soon convene, to decide how the remaining<br />\n$800,0oo will be secured. It is<br />\nPractically certain that we shall endeavor to collect this amount outside of the city from philanthropists<br />\nand others interested in the welfare<br />\nof the University. We shall not<br />\nappeal to Baltimoreans as a whole,<br />\nbut if there are any citizens who<br />\nwould like to help in the extension<br />\n`A.Trk, we shall welcome their subscriptions. As for the actual building at Homewood, no work will be<br />\ndone this winter. Corps of men<br />\nhave been grading the tract,of -land<br />\nthis summer and some foundations<br />\nhave been marked off. This work<br />\nwill be resumed in the spring. The<br />\nBuilding Committee has been enlarged in order to make the work<br />\nmore systematic, and they have already made some definite plans but<br />\ndo not wish to announce just what<br />\nthese plans are until later.<br />\n\"To work on the committees necessitates a great sacrifice of personal business. During the local<br />\ncampaign last winter the members<br />\nof the committee left their business<br />\nfor days at a time and it meant a<br />\ngreat loss to them. This is probably the reason why they have not<br />\nYet gotten to work. However, we<br />\nshall soon meet and set out to complete the fund.\"<br />\nSome persons interested in the<br />\nOn to Homewood\" movement are<br />\nOf the opinion that<br />\nthe State of<br />\nMaryland should complete the fund.<br />\nThey point out the fact that in<br />\n1910, the Commonwealth of Wisconsin gave $1,196,500 for extension work and improvements at the<br />\nstate university at Madison; and<br />\nalso that Michigan and Nebraska<br />\nannually give $640,000 and $565.000, respectively, to their state universities. It is true that Johns Hopkins is not a state university, but<br />\nthere are persons who still think<br />\nthe State of Maryland should complete the fund.<br />\nB. Howell Griswold, chairman of<br />\nthe committee,<br />\nstated last Friday<br />\nl'at no substantial increases had<br />\n)een made in the<br />\nfund.<br /><br />\nOf the seven alumni on the State<br />\nand city tickets, in the recent election, Hopkins men will be glad to<br />\nsee that four were elected. At first<br />\nsight this may seem a very small<br />\nnumber, but one must remember<br />\nhow very few college or professional men run for the State Legislature. Indeed, this has been one<br />\nof the crying needs of the State<br />\nfor many years. Probably several<br />\nyears ago we would have been .fortunate to have one or two of our<br />\nalumni among the law Makers,<br />\nwhereas, now we have four.

B. degree.<br />\nThe next two years were spent as<br />\nprivate secretary to PostmasterGeneral Wilson. Then after practicing law for several years at Martinsburg, he moved to Cleveland,<br />\n0., where he resumed the practice<br />\nof law.<br />\nHe was a professor in. the Baldwin University of Ohio, and City<br />\nSolicitor of Cleveland. Here he<br />\nbecame one of the lieutenants of<br />\nthe late Tom L. Johnson. On Tuesday last Ile was elected mayor of<br />\nCleveland, and had the honor of receiving the largest plurality(17,000)<br />\na candidate has ever received. Mr.<br />\nBaker declared the result was \"a<br />\nmonument to the late Tom L.

There were a<br />\nnumber of ex-Hopkins men present,<br />\nand Charles A.

The size of the score<br />\nindicates nothing of the fierceness<br />\nof the contest. The Hopkins team<br />\nmade a splendid fight, and the<br />\nstruggle, from start to finish, was<br />\nfull of vim.<br />\nThe game started off quick and<br />\nsnappy. Gillet kicked off. After considerable punting, in which 'Virginia<br />\nhad a decided advantage, the winners punted to Hopkins'5-yard line,<br />\nand after a fierce struggle, managed<br />\nto push the ball over for the first<br />\ntouchdown. Yeager kicked goal.<br />\nThe punting continued and the first<br />\nquarter ended with no further<br />\nchange in score.<br />\nVirginia began the second quarter<br />\nwith a rush. Through the failure<br />\noi a forward pass, Hopkins secured<br />\nthe ball on its 5-yard line, and Fulton punted to the 40-yard line.<br />\nHere Todd, of Virginia, caught it<br />\nand broke through the Hopkins.<br />\nline for a second touchdown. Yeager<br />\nkicked goal.<br />\nAt the beginning of the third<br />\nquarter, Yeager, of Virginia, caught<br />\none of Gillet's forward passes and<br />\nran 40 yards to make a touchdown.<br />\nHe kicked goal. Another punting<br />\nduel ensued in the course of which<br />\nVirginia made a touchback. Hopkins attempted several poorly executed forward passes, and the<br />\nVirginians made their fourth touchdown. No goal was kicked. At<br />\nthis point Hopkins woke up for<br />\nan instant. Gillet made 10 yards,<br />\nPieper, To; Branham, io; Pieper,<br />\n10 more, and Dodson, 10<br />\nHopkins braced up again at the<br />\nbeginning of the last quarter, but<br />\nsoon lost the ball on an attempted<br />\nforward pass, and Virginia rushed<br />\nit\"down the field for a touchdown.<br />\nDavidson missed the goal. The<br />\nlast touchdown, also, Virginia carried by storm. Gillet had kicked<br />\noff to Virginia's I-yard line. In<br />\ntwo plays, Virginia brought the ball<br />\nto Hopkins' 35-yard line, and in the<br />\nnext play put it over. Goal was<br />\nkicked. The rest of the game was<br />\na listless sparring against time.<br />\nNo part of the defeat can be<br />\ncharged to the Hopkins rooters.<br />\nUnder the able leadership of Freddie<br />\nLee, they did their duty well, yelling when the team was gaining and<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3.)<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 13, 1911.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nThe News=Letter<br />\nFOUNDED, 1897.<br />\nSUBSCRIPTION :<br /><br />\n$1.50 per year.<br />\nEntered<br />\ncember 3,<br />\nBaltimore,<br />\nNovember<br /><br />\n5 cents per copy.<br /><br />\nas second class matter De1909, at the Post Office at<br />\nMd., under Act of Congress,<br />\n3, 1879.<br /><br />\n\u2022Published weekly from October to<br />\nJune by the undergraduates of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER;<br />\nall articles and other cominunications<br />\nshould be sent to the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.<br />\nTelephone,<br /><br />\n- - -<br /><br />\nMt.

Carter,<br />\nchairman ; G. Y. Rusk, A.

According to present plans,<br />\nthe- society will hold weekly contests in declamation, public speaking and debate. At the end of the<br />\nyear a final contest will be held, to<br />\nthe winners of which medals will<br />\nbe given. It has also been suggested that the society enter upon<br />\nthe field left vacant by the defunct<br />\nHaresfoot Club, and present a play<br />\nduring the season.
