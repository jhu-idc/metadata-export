If passed, the bill would raise<br />\nthe amount of aid Hopkins<br />\nreceives annually from the state<br />\nfrom S94 1,000 to about<br />\nS1,580,000, in a two-phase<br />\nprocess.<br />\nThe bill would change the<br />\nprocess of granting state aid to<br />\nMaryland's private colleges and<br />\nuniversities as of July 1. to a<br />\n<br />\ngrant of S138 for each full time<br />\nequivalent student enrolled<br />\nduring fiscal 1975. The old state<br />\naid formula awarded funds based<br />\non the number of degrees the<br />\ninstitution granted. Hopkins got<br />\nS500 per degree awarded.<br />\nFor fiscal 1976, the bill would<br />\nraise the amount of aid granted<br />\nper full time student to S243,<br />\nwhich would yield Hopkins<br />\nS1,5 80,000, on the basis of<br />\n6,500 full time equivalent<br />\nstudents. The number of full<br />\ntime equivalent students is set by<br />\nthe number of credit hours<br />\nstudents a re taking, not the<br />\nnumber of students enrolled full<br />\n<br />\ntime. Thus, Hopkins stands to<br />\ngain considerably from its large<br />\nevening college enrollment of<br />\npart time students.<br />\nSince Hopkins received<br />\nS941,000 last year under the old<br />\nformula, and would receive only<br />\n$890,000 under the first phase of<br />\nthe new system, a supplemental<br />\nappropriation is to be sought to<br />\nmake up the $50,000 difference,<br />\naccording to Ellery Woodworth,<br />\nspecial assistant to President<br />\nMuller. Three other private<br />\ninstitutions would also lose under<br />\nthe first phase of the new<br />\nformula, but the same<br />\nsupplemental appropriation will<br />\n<br />\nrn<br />\n<br />\nIn<br />\n<br />\nst<br />\n11<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nvol. lxxviii. no. 28/tuesday, january 29, 1974/baltimore, mar)land/78th year<br />\n<br />\nAdministrative salaries frozen<br />\nNo salary adjustments will be<br />\ngranted administrative employees<br />\nof Hopkins Health Divisions,<br />\nBusiness Management or<br />\nUniversity Affairs operations,<br />\nuntil July 1, pending completion<br />\nof the first stage of an employee<br />\nclassification program.<br />\nThe salary freeze for the<br />\nMedical Divisions was<br />\nimplemented by Dr. Russell H.<br />\nMorgan, Vice-President for<br />\nMedical Divisions, in a<br />\nmemorandum to department<br />\nheads at the Medical Institutions<br />\nearly this month.

In 1973, there<br />\nwere 1,137 registrations for<br />\ncourses among the undergraduate<br />\nbody, an average of 1.49 for each<br />\nstudent, while this year's course<br />\nregistrations were at 1,039, an<br />\naverage of 1.40 for each student.<br />\nFurthermore, independent<br />\nstudy and research courses were<br />\ndown approximately 25%. Only<br />\n138 students took independent<br />\nwork in 1974, while 183 did so<br />\nin 1973.<br />\nBy far the largest drop in the<br />\n<br />\nnumber of students in<br />\nindependent study occurred in<br />\nWriting Seminars.

The Psychology Department<br />\nhad 204 enrollees, down from<br />\n380 the year before. The drop,<br />\nwas in part due to the sharply<br />\nreduced number of courses<br />\noffered by the department this<br />\nyear. Eight Psychology courses<br />\nwere offered this January . as<br />\ncompared in 20 in 1973. The<br />\nmost popular course in the<br />\ndepartment was Biofeedback<br />\nwhich attracted 40 students.<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering was third in total<br />\nenrollment with 101 students. of<br />\nwhich 90 percent took the course<br />\n\"New Town Planning.\"<br />\nDepartments which showed a<br />\nsubstantial increase in<br />\nintersession course enrollment.<br />\nover tiles previous year included<br />\nPolitical Science which jumped<br />\nfrom 38 to 95.<br />\n<br />\nstrictly that of the director Alan<br />\nWade, a teacher at Towson State<br />\nCollege, hired by the<br />\nto direct the<br />\nBarnstormers<br />\nplay.

I spent three and a<br />\nhalf years in high school<br />\nlaboring unceaselessly in order<br />\nto go to college where, I<br />\nthought, mature students<br />\nsought knowledge and<br />\nconcerned themselves with<br />\nmatters of consequence. Much<br />\nto my disappointment and<br />\ndisillusionment, I found the<br />\natmosphere to be academic<br />\nrather than intellectual. The<br />\nfaculty must bear the burden of<br />\nresponsibility for this. All too<br />\noften faculty members confuse<br />\ntheir priorities and place<br />\nresearch above teaching.

Before hiring a<br />\ndirector we stress that everyone<br />\nWho comes .to audition be given<br />\nan equal chance.

In this<br />\nsituation we learned of the<br />\nconflict too late to resolve it.<br />\nThis letter, therefore, should<br />\nbe read as an apology to those<br />\nconcerned. As such it can only<br />\nbe inadequate. The<br />\nBarnstormers accept full<br />\nresponsibility for all casting<br />\ndecisions, and if blame is to be<br />\nassigned, it lies with us.

At the<br />\nsame time, one must take into<br />\nconsideration both the positive<br />\nand the negative effects of<br />\nfaculty research.

A number of proposals<br />\npreviously offered to help<br />\nalleviate the problem have<br />\nincluded construction of a<br />\n$600,00 parking tier which<br />\nwould rise above the parking area<br />\nsouth of Garland Hall, and<br />\ninstallation of a large<br />\nunderground facility in the<br />\nvicinity of the lot located along<br />\nRemmington Street.<br />\nAlso proposed was a possible<br />\nworking arrangement with Union<br />\nMemorial Hospital which would<br />\nallow Hopkins students to make<br />\nuse of the new Parking facility<br />\nlocated along St. Paul Street,<br />\nacross from McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe parking tier, if<br />\nconstructed next to Garland Hall,<br />\nwould contribute approximately<br />\n200 parking spaces to those 1182<br />\nspaces which exist presently on<br />\ncampus. Thus far, no decision to<br />\nconstruct the facility has been<br />\nmade.<br /><br />\nThe Homewood campus will<br />\nenjoy a small addition to its<br />\nparking facilities this semester.<br />\nThe new area, adjacent to<br />\nexisting space behind the dorms<br />\nis reserved exclusively for the<br />\nstaff and patients of the<br />\nUniversity Counselling Service<br />\nlocated in the White House.<br />\nGeorge Weinbach, Director of<br />\nCampus Security, explicitly<br />\nstated that \"the new facility is<br />\nnot for dormitory students or<br />\nother personnel\" except these<br />\nassociated with the White House.<br />\nIdeally the new area,<br />\nconsisting of 16 spaces for autos<br />\nand two for motorcycles, will<br />\nalleviate parking 'problems near<br />\nthe Faculty Club. Dormitory<br />\nresidents owning motorcycles<br />\nmay benefit from the extra two<br />\nspaces, however. These spaces<br />\nsupplement existing facilities for<br />\nmotorcycles, located at the<br />\npower house and greenhouse.<br />\nWeinbach also dispelled<br />\nrumors of new parking areas for<br />\nstudents. \"We have no plans to<br />\nenlarge facilities at present,\"<br />\nciting that 1182 parking spaces,<br />\nsome with meters, are available<br />\nto permit holders and \"early<br />\nbirds.\" He felt that some chance<br /><br />\nconfident, even elated.

Within<br />\nthe next few weeks, those<br />\nstudent organizations receiving<br />\nfunds will be asked to su mit<br />\ntheir projected budget requests<br />\nfor consideration. Neither Savitz<br />\nnor John Tillem, S.C. treasurer<br />\nand Chairman of the Student<br /><br />\nActivities Commission were<br />\nprepared to give out specific<br />\ndetails but both ruled out the<br />\npossiblity of drastic budget cuts<br />\nfor any student organization..<br />\nThe Student Council under<br />\nSavitz has made it a point- to<br />\nestablish regular channels of<br />\ncommunication between the S.C.<br />\nand the University. In pursuit of<br />\nthat aim, preparations are now<br />\nunderway for a meeting between<br />\nrepresentatives from the Council<br />\nand the full Board of Trustees.<br />\nThis follows upon the successful<br />\nmeeting held in November<br />\nbetween Council members and<br />\nt h e Trustees'<br />\nExecutive.<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nConfer<br />\nIn addition, this Friday,<br />\nSavitz, Colmers and Shep<br />\nHoffman, Senior Class president,<br />\nwill confer with the departmental<br />\nchairmen at Homewood. \"This is<br />\nlaying :the groundwork for a<br />\ncloser and continuing line of<br />\ncommunication with students<br />\nand chairman of the<br />\ndepartments,\" said Hoffmann.<br />\nTillem has been in contact<br />\nwith George S.

The<br />\narmy during all this time stood<br />\nby and watched the people of<br />\nChile and life in general<br />\nstretched to the breaking point.<br />\nDo the people of the United<br />\nStates know about Plan Zeta?<br />\nOn September 19, mass<br />\nassassinations and guerrilla<br />\nactions were planned for<br />\nSantiago and Chile. President<br />\nAllende was to invite the three<br />\ncommanders of the armed<br />\nforces to lunch at La Moneda.<br />\nThey were to be assassinated<br />\nand upon a prearranged signal,<br />\nscores of armed groups were to<br />\nassassinate most of the major<br />\nfigures in the armed forces,<br />\npolitics, and the anti-left press.<br />\nIt is sad to now learn that<br />\nPresident Allende himself was<br />\nto be assassinated; he could<br />\nnever have known.<br />\nIt was clear that someone had<br />\nto act. Thousands of persons<br />\nhad been demanding Allende's<br />\nresignation for weeks, and<br />\nthousands had been showing<br />\ntheir support. The offices of the<br />\nPeace Corps in Santiago prior to<br />\nthe coup were constantly being<br />\nrendered uninhabitable by tear<br /><br />\nprinted on this page last Friday and as<br />\na letter and a story published today would<br />\nindicate, the<br />\nparticular difficulties of Black students on<br />\nthis campus<br />\nare a long way from being solved. In recent<br />\nweeks, there<br />\nhas been at least one documented inciden<br />\nt of racial<br />\ndiscrimination, in addition to those other occasi<br />\nons on<br />\nwhich Black students have felt the sting of<br />\nbigotry.<br />\nOver the past several years, the University<br />\nhas made at<br />\nleast a small effort to increase the number<br />\nof Blacks in<br />\nthe student body \u2014 today there are fewer<br />\nthan 100<br />\nenrolled \u2014 and to hire Black faculty member<br />\ns. But the<br />\nUniversity has made no effort whatever to<br />\nencourage<br />\nBlack participation in student activities, to<br />\noffer Black<br />\nstudents an opportunity to study in Black<br />\nStudies<br />\nprograms, or to help them with the problems<br />\nthey face<br />\nhere as Black students in a predominan<br />\ntly white<br />\ninstitution.
