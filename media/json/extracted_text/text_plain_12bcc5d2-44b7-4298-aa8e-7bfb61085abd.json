Instead, it's<br />\nbecause of the intense academic atmosphere.<br />\nA week before most exams, students become<br />\nso uptight that they can't do anything but<br />\nstudy.<br />\nLast semester, for example, the junior<br />\nclass held a forum to discuss the MCATSpring Fair conflict\u2014both the Medical College Admission Test and Spring Fair were<br />\nscheduled for April 28. But because the<br />\nforum was to take place on the eve of a<br />\nMolecular Cell Biology exam, only six<br />\nstudents showed up. The other 30 percent<br />\nof the junior class were studying for the<br />\nexam; they needed the grade to get into<br />\nmedical school. They probably forgot that<br />\nthe MCAT also is a crucial factor in being<br />\nconsidered for a slot in a medical school<br />\nclass.<br />\nBut after the exam, they complained. They<br />\nrealized that the noise from Spring Fair<br />\nwould cause them discomfort when taking<br />\nthe MCAT on campus. So they griped<br />\namong themselves, and they continued to<br />\ngrumble until, luckily, the MCAT was moved<br />\nto the School of Medicine downtown.<br />\nFortunately, not everyone is a premedical<br />\nstudent at Hopkins. Not everyone runs from<br />\none science course to another when one ends<br />\nand the other one is about to begin just to<br />\nmake sure he gets a seat in the front row.<br />\nNot everyone thinks his professor is lying<br />\nwhen he cancels a lecture. Recently, four<br />\nstudents were found in an Organic Chemistry<br />\nlecture hall when the professor told everyone<br />\nthe day before that he wasn't going to show<br />\nup.<br />\nThere's something definitely wrong with<br />\nstudent life at Hopkins. Basically, the problem is careerism\u2014more specifically, preprofessionalism. Of the 600 or so seniors<br />\nwho graduate every year, about 30 percent<br />\ngo on to medical school, 10 to 20 percent to<br />\nlaw school, and 15 to 20 percent to some job<br />\nin the engineering profession. That's a large<br />\npercentage of students who think they know<br />\nwhat they want to do with the rest of their<br />\nlives. What about the other 40 or so percent?<br />\nEnter the second problem. When students<br />\ndecide to attend Hopkins, they have to<br />\n<br />\ndecide what they want to do with their four<br />\n<br />\nyears. They don't receive much guidance as<br />\nto what courses they should take. It's pretty<br />\nmuch up to the student, and everyone knows<br />\nit. Most administrators and faculty members<br />\nview this aspect of Hopkins as a plus. They<br />\ncall it \"academic freedom\" while students<br />\ncall it \"academic torture.\"<br />\nThus, two types of students are found at<br />\nHopkins: those students who only have professional careers on their minds and those<br />\nstudents whose minds are turning to mush<br />\ntrying to decide what to do from day to day.<br />\nSo it's no wonder that Hopkins has a<br />\nreputation as a social wasteland. No one<br />\nreally has any time to have a substantial<br />\nsocial life. And no one wants to spend the<br />\ntime to improve the good times they already<br />\nenjoy.

Fielding<br />\nonly two professors at the moment, the Institute is planning<br />\n.a major expansion with the addition of a new director and<br />\n.another professor. If a poll<br />\nwere taken of Homewood students, however, the Institute<br />\nwould probably vie with Evergreen House for the dubious<br />\ndistinction of being the least<br />\nknown part of Hopkins. While<br />\nthe rest of you were on Spring<br />\nBreak, this writer decided to<br />\nfind out a little more of what<br />\nthe Institute had to offer.<br />\nTo say that the Institute is<br />\nnot a major part of the Medical<br />\nSchool would be a misconception. Anyone who has been to<br />\nthe top floor of Welch Medical<br />\nLibrary has seen the collection<br />\nof old medical instruments and<br />\nmemorabilia. The Smithsonian<br />\nit is not, but nevertheless, the<br />\ncollection lends a certain atmosphere to the floor. One wing of<br />\nthe floor also houses a small<br />\nlibrary which contains books<br />\ndating back more than a century and a half.<br />\nIn Dr. Jerome J. Bylebyl's<br />\nopinion, the history of<br />\nmedicine is a popular and interesting subject. Modern<br />\nmedicine has been in existence<br />\nand there is a need for health<br />\nprofessionals to develop a<br />\nperspective. \"It is important<br />\nfor medical people to appreciate how they got there,\"<br />\nBylebyl stated.<br />\nEarly medicine meant a lot of<br />\nthings to different peoples. For<br />\nthe ancient Greeks, medicine<br />\nwas a craft rather than a profession. Physicians were regarded as craftsmen, much like<br />\ncarpenters or shoemakers. The<br />\nclout and prestige enjoyed by<br />\nthe medical profession today<br />\nwould have been something<br />\ntotally foreign. The Greeks<br />\nthought about health differently, and that contributed to their<br />\nconcept of physicians. They<br />\nstressed prevention and believed<br />\nthat a diseased state was caused<br />\nby a multitute of factors. Thus,<br />\nonce a person was sick, the<br />\nphysician could do little more<br />\nthan acknowledge the fact and<br />\nprescribe rest.<br />\nThe Romans were less medically oriented than the Greeks.<br />\nEven though they literally ruled<br />\n<br />\nthe known world, their medical<br />\nphilosophy relied largely on the<br />\nuse of home remedies. After<br />\nestablishing contact with the<br />\nGreeks, the Romans brought<br />\nover many Greek physicians.<br />\nThe famous physician and<br />\nmedical scholar, Galan, was<br />\nknown to have treated many<br />\nRoman patriarchs. With the<br />\ncollapse of the Roman Empire,<br />\nthe recording of medical history<br />\neffectively stopped. The early<br />\nMiddle Ages were a Dark Age<br />\nin terms of medical progress.<br />\nNothing much is really known<br />\nabout what types of people<br />\ngave medical aid nor what<br />\ntreatments were common. We<br />\ndo know, however, that in the<br />\nlatter part of the Middle Ages,<br />\nmany doctors, especially<br />\nsurgeons, were also barbers.<br />\nThus, physicians were still<br />\ncraftsmen.<br />\n<br />\nInstitute for the History of Medicine<br />\n<br />\nActing Director Dr. Jerome J.<br />\nBylebyl.<br />\n<br />\nIn the late Middle Ages,<br />\nleaders made the political decision to make medicine a learned profession. The chartering<br />\nof medical schools first began<br />\nin the Italian city-states<br />\nsometime between 1250 and<br />\n1300. Slowly this standard was<br />\nadopted throughout Europe.<br />\nThough their knowledge was<br />\nprimitive compared to ours, it<br />\nwas a real attempt to teach the<br />\nstandard medical techniques of<br />\nthe times.<br />\nAccording to Bylebyl, the<br />\nrevolution in medicine occurred<br />\nin the late 19th century. The<br />\ngerm theory had a tremendous<br />\nimpact on the health profession. The appreciation of<br />\nmicro-organisms as causes of<br />\ndisease led to greater understanding and better methods of<br />\nprevention and treatment.<br />\nWhen the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity School of Medicine<br />\nopened in 1893 it was a pioneer<br />\nin medical instruction. At the<br />\ntime, there were more than 150<br />\nmedical schools in the U.S. The<br />\nbasic science curriculum usually<br />\nlasted one year, and this instruction only entailed what we<br />\n<br />\nJHMI Office of Public Affairs<br />\n<br />\nAdministrative Assistant Mary Moore in the Rare Books Room.<br />\n<br />\nwould now call the pre-med ternships were first introduced<br />\ncurriculum.

Now, director Rob<br />\nReiner and collaborators<br />\nChristopher Guest, Michael<br />\nMcKean and Harry Shearer<br />\nhave created This is Spinal Tap,<br />\na movie that weaves virtually<br />\nevery element of rock-and-roll<br />\nmedia culture into a sharp,<br />\nknowing sendup of the genre,<br />\nand, by extension, of another<br />\npop culture hybrid: the rock<br />\ndocumentary.<br />\nEmploying 16-millimeter<br />\ncameras and a completely improvised \"screenplay\", Reiner<br />\nand company trace the (mostly<br />\nbad)fortunes of Spinal Tap, a<br />\nfictitious British band whose<br />\nroots seem to extend to every<br />\nwatershed musical movement<br />\nsince the Invasion: starting out<br />\nas the Thamesmen,a Herman's<br />\nHermit-type outfit appearing<br />\non the BBC show Pop, Look<br />\nand Listen;jumping on the hippie bandwagon in 1967 with<br />\ntheir first American hit (Listen<br />\nto the) Flower People; Experimenting with glitter in the<br />\nearly 70's (in concept albums<br />\nlike The Sun Never Sweats);<br />\n<br />\nand finally settling into semiobscure middle age with that<br />\nold reliable, heavy metal. The<br />\nmost disturbing thing about this<br />\nchronology is that it suggests<br />\nthat were the Beatles still<br />\ntogether today, they might be<br />\nBlack Sabbath.<br />\nThere are other echoes of the<br />\nBeatles in the group's backstage<br />\nlife. Spinal Tap is fronted by<br />\nNigel Tufnel(Guest)and David<br />\nSt. Hubbins (McKean), two<br />\n\"almost poets, like Byron or<br />\nShelley.\" whose continual<br />\ncreative differences threaten the<br />\nexistence of the band. Not the<br />\nleast of these differences<br />\nrevolve around St. Hubbin's<br />\ngirlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick), who, a la Yoko Ono,<br />\nkeeps making artistic suggestions and business decisions<br />\nbased on the band's astrological<br />\ncharts.<br />\nThe plot of the movie concerns Spinal Tap's 1982 comeback tour of America, and the<br />\nsimultaneous release of its first<br />\nalbum in six years, Smell the<br />\nglove. Both the tour and the<br />\nalbum are overseen by the<br />\nband's manager, Ian Faith<br />\n(Tony Hendra), a youthful<br />\nlooking, well educated Briton<br />\nwho carries a cricket bat as an<br />\n\"oh, what's the word..yes. Affectation.\" As the film<br />\ndocuments Spinal Tap's<br />\njourney through the States, it<br />\naccumulates a mass of telling<br />\n<br />\ndetails and witty .sight gags:<br />\nplates of unscrewed Oreos as<br />\npart of a backstage buffet; a<br />\nrecord autographing session for<br />\nwhich no fans show up; Nigel's<br />\nwireless guitar, which has an<br />\nunfortunate habit of pulling in<br />\nradio signals during solos; a trip<br />\nthrough the catacombs of a<br />\nCleveland auditorium, where<br />\nthe band gets lost between the<br />\ndressing room and the stage.<br />\nThe film has structural influences as well, most notably<br />\nLet it Be, The Kids are Alright,<br />\nand The Last Waltz. (One of<br />\nthe slyest bits of parody is<br />\nReiner's own performance as<br />\nMarty DiBergi, the somewhat<br />\ntorpid, obsequious director<br />\nwho decides to make a film<br />\nabout Spinal Tap, and who<br />\nputs himself into the picture as<br />\ndoggedly as Martin Scorsese<br />\ndid at the Band's \"last waltz.\"<br />\nIn his thick beard and<br />\nparamilitary peaked cap,<br />\nReiner looks like every<br />\nHollywood upstart from<br />\nGeorge Lucas to Steven<br />\nSpielberg.) Some problems<br />\ncome when the movie begins to<br />\nsneak away from documentary<br />\ninto docudrama, as in certain<br />\nparty scenes and Nigel-David<br />\nconfrontations, when the actors<br />\nstart behaving too much like actors, and not enough like people whose private lives are<br />\n(somewhat randomly) being<br />\ncaught on film.<br />\n<br />\nPress Photo<br />\n<br />\nHowever, most of the performances are excellent, and one<br />\nis classic. Hendra and Guest use<br />\nthe gifts for caricature they<br />\ndisplayed so well as members of<br />\nthe National Lampoon stable;<br />\nMcKean shows a flair for accents and an ability to mock<br />\nrock platitudes without condescension. But the biggest<br />\npleasure is Paul Shaffer, in a<br />\nbrief role as Artie Fufkin,<br />\n\"Midwest Promotions Coordinator, Polymer Records.\"<br />\nLike the actors in shows such as<br />\n\"SCTV,\" Shaffer seems to<br />\nbring complete knowledge of<br />\nhis character's shallowness in-<br />\n<br />\nto the performance without<br />\novertly displaying it.<br />\nThe only real flaw is the<br />\nmusic. The songs are bad\u2014yes,<br />\nthey're supposed to be; but<br />\nthey're not inspired enough to<br />\nbe hilariously bad, and because<br />\nof that they don't serve the<br />\nsatiric purpose for which they<br />\nseem to be intended.

Police Chief John<br />\nBrady suspects a link between<br />\nthe killings and the work of<br />\nProfessor Gwen Parkinson at<br />\nGalesburg College. However,<br />\nBrady's accusations are<br />\ndismissed because he bears<br />\n<br />\nsome long standing grudge<br />\nagainst the Professor's supposedly dead mentor.<br />\nMeanwhile, Brady's son<br />\nPeter has been participating in<br />\nDr. Parkinson's research to<br />\nearn the money he needs to<br />\napply to college. After a paricularly nauseating treatment,<br />\nPeter begins to exhibit some<br />\nvery strange symptoms. It's not<br />\nhard to guess the rest.

Laughlin gives us<br />\nevery traditional element of the<br />\ngenre: the mad scientist, the<br />\n'Halloween-masked killer, the<br />\n<br />\ngruff \"seen it all\" cop from the<br />\nbig city, the body in the<br />\nbathtub, and the sappy happy<br />\nending. The soundtrack by<br />\nTangerine Dream is pure<br />\ngeneric chill builder.<br />\nAlthough not quite a parody,<br />\nStrange Behavior is definitely<br />\nnot a serious film.

According to Athletic Director<br />\nBob Scott, this was Hopkins'<br />\nlowest scoring game since 1942,<br />\nwhen they were defeated by<br />\nPrinceton, 4-2.<br />\nWith Hopkins and Carolina<br />\naveraging more than 14 and 13<br />\ngoals a game, respectively,<br />\nmany had expected the contest<br />\nto be a shoot-out. It was not,<br />\nhowever, as both teams were<br />\nunable to effectively make the<br />\ntransition from defense to offense. Indeed, at many times, it<br />\nappeared as if both teams were<br />\ntrying to \"sit on the ball,\"<br />\nwaiting for the defense to make<br />\na mistake.<br />\n\"A classic dogfight\" is what<br />\nBlue Jay Coach Don Zimmerman called it, saying, \"it might<br />\nnot be the best thing for the<br />\nfans to watch, but the players<br />\nknow they've been in a game.\"<br />\nHopkins' starting line-up was<br />\nwhat was expected, with Peter<br />\nScott, Willy Odenthal, Brian<br />\nWood on attack. At midfield<br />\nwere Rich Glancy, Del Dressel,<br />\nand John Krumenacker. Guy<br />\nMatricciani, Steve Dubin, and<br />\nJohn DeTomasso were on<br />\ndefense, while Larry Quinn<br />\nguarded the goal.<br />\nFor the first several minutes<br />\nof the game, both teams were<br />\ntrying to feel each other out.<br />\nOn their second possession, the<br />\nJays' middies took nothing but<br />\noutside bounce shots with the<br />\n<br />\nno one picked him up, Haus<br />\ntook the shot and netted his second goal of the season.<br />\nThe Tar Heels wasted little<br />\ntime in scoring again as they let<br />\nloose attackman Mac Ford.<br />\nFord, Carolina's leading scorer<br />\nwith 14 goals, tried to take<br />\nDeTommaso one-on-one as he<br />\ncircled from behind the net to<br />\nQuinn's right side. With<br />\nDeTommaso checking him<br />\ntightly, Ford jumped and shot<br />\nweakly. Quinn, expecting a<br />\nstrong shot, was caught by surprise and allowed the ball to<br />\nskip beneath his stick. Still, a<br />\ngoal is a goal, and Carolina led<br />\n2-1.<br />\nNear the end of the first<br />\nperiod, Hopkins scored what<br />\nturned out to be a very important goal. With less than a<br />\nminute remaining, the Blue<br />\nJays brought the ball<br />\ndownfield. The midfield worked the ball around and found<br />\nWood 10 yards from the left<br />\nside of the goal. Taking one<br />\nstep, he fired high and hard,<br />\nonly to have the shot stopped<br />\nby Mealey. The ball popped<br />\nloose, however, and Tucker<br />\nwas able to scoop it into the<br />\nvacated net.<br />\nOnly one second was showing on the clock, though, and<br />\nfor many upperclassmen and<br />\nalumni it must have brought<br />\nback memories of the Championship game against Carolina<br />\nthree years ago when two<br />\nsimilar goals were disallowed.<br />\nFortunately for Hopkins, the<br />\nscoreboard time was the<br />\nofficial time.

Then, one out later,<br />\nBobby Cardwell drove home<br />\nbrother Jimmy with a single.<br />\nThe Jays finished the scoring<br />\nin the sixth, adding a single run<br />\nto make it a 6-0 victory.<br />\nThe second game was a<br />\nheart-stopper. Ursinus came<br />\nstorming back from its first<br />\ngame to score five times in the<br />\nbottom of the first inning.<br />\nDavid Provost (2-0, 3.4 ERA)<br />\nstarted the game, but only<br />\nlasted one-third of an inning.<br />\nAfter striking out the first hitter, Pro became wild and the<br />\ndefense became shaky. Four<br />\nwalks, two errors, a pass-ball,<br />\nand two hits later, Ursinus was<br />\nstaked to an early 5-0 lead.<br />\nGeoff Bender came on to pitch<br />\nout of the inning and shut down<br />\nthe Ursinus offense for the rest<br />\nof the game, pitching 6 2/3 innings of brilliant shut out relief.<br />\nThe Blue Jays did not quit,<br />\nhowever. In the fifth, Jimmy<br />\nCardwell led off with a walk.<br />\nAn error on a Campbell ground<br />\nball put runners on first and second. A single by Bobby Cardwell loaded the b'ases. Scott<br />\nBurns followed with a double,<br />\nscoring Jim Cardwell and<br />\nCampbell. Jon Meltzer hit a<br />\nsacrifice fly to right field to<br />\nmake the score 5-3. An RBI<br />\ngrounder to shortstop by<br />\n<br />\nWilly Raedle slides safely into second base against Western Maryland.<br />\n<br />\nLachance scored Burns to make<br />\nit a one-run ball game.<br />\nThe Jays didn't let up. In the<br />\nsixth, Brooks led off with a<br />\nsingle and Bill Miller and Jimmy Cardwell reached with<br />\nwalks. With the bases loaded,<br />\nCampbell hit a sacrifice fly to<br />\nscore Brooks and tie the game.<br />\nAn error by the catcher allowed Miller to score the go ahead<br />\nrun.<br />\nBender was cruising right<br />\nalong, until the bottom of the<br />\nseventh. He easily got the first<br />\ntwo outs with a strike out and<br />\na grounder to shortstop. But,<br />\nthe next hitter doubled, putting<br />\nthe tying run in scoring position. Then came near disaster.<br />\nBender threw a wild pitch in the<br />\ndirt, that skidded away from<br />\nCatcher Miller.<br />\nThrowing off his mask,<br />\nMiller searched for the ball, but<br />\ncouldn't locate it. As infielders<br />\npointed in the direction of the<br />\nball and Miller continued to<br />\nsearch, the runner went to third<br />\n<br />\ndle singled him home.<br />\nWestern Maryland went on<br />\ntop again in the third, as Fearer<br />\nwalked two, made an error, and<br />\nsurrendered a hit.<br />\nIn the fourth, WM scored<br />\nagain\u2014their only earned run\u2014<br />\nto pull ahead by two runs.<br />\nThe Jays closed the gap to<br />\none run in the sixth. Raedle led<br />\noff with a single. A fielder's<br />\nchoice by Brooks erased Raedle<br />\nand Lachance singled to create<br />\na first and third situation.<br />\nCoach Robert Babb brought in<br />\nMeltzer to pinch hit. He hit a<br />\nhard smash on the ground to<br />\nthe second baseman who went<br />\nfor a double play. Lachance<br />\nslid in hard to second base to<br />\nslow the relay to first base and<br />\nbreak up the double play.<br />\nBrooks scored on the fielder's<br />\nchoice.<br />\nHopkins tied the game in the<br />\neighth, when Raedle was hit by<br />\na pitch and stole second.<br />\nBrooks bunted him to third and<br />\nLachance singled him home.<br />\n<br />\njob. Cardwell leads the team<br />\nwith 11 runs scored and Landolphi leads the team in stolen<br />\nbases(8 for 8), walks (15), and<br />\nis third in runs scored (9).<br />\nWith the sweep of Ursinus,<br />\nthe Blue Jays are in first place<br />\nin the Southeastern division and<br />\nare in a position to control its<br />\nplayoff future. The team has<br />\ntwo more crucial doubleheaders<br />\nagainst Washington College<br />\n(Saturday)and Haverford College (April 28). If Hopkins can<br />\nsweep these doubleheaders,<br />\nthey will be no worse off than<br />\na tie for first at the season's<br />\nconclusion.

He hates<br />\nto lose.\" Because of class conflicts he has been unable to<br />\ncome to practice regularly, but<br />\nFowler-Dressler expects him to<br />\nimprove as he gets more playing time in.<br />\nBlaker will be playing at the<br />\nnumber three run. FowlerDressler \"expects more out of<br />\nhim in the upcoming weeks.<br />\nHe'll win a lot at three, and I<br />\nexpect him to dominate at second doubles.\"<br />\nBill Gillespie, Shaun Gelsinger and David Gibbs should<br />\nalso be strong contenders in the<br />\nfour, five, and six slots.<br />\nFowler-Dressler expects a<br />\nstrong showing in the doubles<br />\ngame. Longo and Fusco will be<br />\nplaying number one, Blaker<br />\nand Gelsinger number two, and<br />\nDave Gibbs and Alex Tang will<br />\nbe number three. According to<br />\nthe coach Alex Tang also has<br />\nschedule conflicts and misses a<br />\ncouple practices a week. She<br />\n\"expects him to move up in the<br />\nline up in the next week or two<br />\nand make us even stronger.

Instead, it's<br />\nbecause of the intense academic atmosphere.<br />\nA week before most exams, students become<br />\nso uptight that they can't do anything but<br />\nstudy.<br />\nLast semester, for example, the junior<br />\nclass held a forum to discuss the MCATSpring Fair conflict\u2014both the Medical College Admission Test and Spring Fair were<br />\nscheduled for April 28. But because the<br />\nforum was to take place on the eve of a<br />\nMolecular Cell Biology exam, only six<br />\nstudents showed up. The other 30 percent<br />\nof the junior class were studying for the<br />\nexam; they needed the grade to get into<br />\nmedical school. They probably forgot that<br />\nthe MCAT also is a crucial factor in being<br />\nconsidered for a slot in a medical school<br />\nclass.<br />\nBut after the exam, they complained. They<br />\nrealized that the noise from Spring Fair<br />\nwould cause them discomfort when taking<br />\nthe MCAT on campus. So they griped<br />\namong themselves, and they continued to<br />\ngrumble until, luckily, the MCAT was moved<br />\nto the School of Medicine downtown.<br />\nFortunately, not everyone is a premedical<br />\nstudent at Hopkins. Not everyone runs from<br />\none science course to another when one ends<br />\nand the other one is about to begin just to<br />\nmake sure he gets a seat in the front row.<br />\nNot everyone thinks his professor is lying<br />\nwhen he cancels a lecture. Recently, four<br />\nstudents were found in an Organic Chemistry<br />\nlecture hall when the professor told everyone<br />\nthe day before that he wasn't going to show<br />\nup.<br />\nThere's something definitely wrong with<br />\nstudent life at Hopkins. Basically, the problem is careerism\u2014more specifically, preprofessionalism. Of the 600 or so seniors<br />\nwho graduate every year, about 30 percent<br />\ngo on to medical school, 10 to 20 percent to<br />\nlaw school, and 15 to 20 percent to some job<br />\nin the engineering profession. That's a large<br />\npercentage of students who think they know<br />\nwhat they want to do with the rest of their<br />\nlives. What about the other 40 or so percent?<br />\nEnter the second problem. When students<br />\ndecide to attend Hopkins, they have to<br /><br />\ndecide what they want to do with their four<br /><br />\nyears. They don't receive much guidance as<br />\nto what courses they should take. It's pretty<br />\nmuch up to the student, and everyone knows<br />\nit. Most administrators and faculty members<br />\nview this aspect of Hopkins as a plus. They<br />\ncall it \"academic freedom\" while students<br />\ncall it \"academic torture.\"<br />\nThus, two types of students are found at<br />\nHopkins: those students who only have professional careers on their minds and those<br />\nstudents whose minds are turning to mush<br />\ntrying to decide what to do from day to day.<br />\nSo it's no wonder that Hopkins has a<br />\nreputation as a social wasteland. No one<br />\nreally has any time to have a substantial<br />\nsocial life. And no one wants to spend the<br />\ntime to improve the good times they already<br />\nenjoy. But there is an exception.<br />\nA few months ago, many.students protested the closing of the undergraduate<br />\nreading room, a 24-hour facility which is the<br />\nonly true social gathering place on campus.<br />\nThe administration withdrew its proposal,<br />\nbut it's a sad comment on student life when<br />\na college's main hangout is a place where<br />\nstudents pull all-nighters.<br />\nNo one seemed to realize that if there were<br />\na more substantial student union, no one<br />\nwould have complained about the proposed<br />\nclosing of the reading room. There would<br />\nbe other places to relax or study.<br />\nThat's a main problem at Hopkins.<br />\nThere's not enough room for everything.<br />\nThis year, the university completed construction on new dormitories, which will enable<br />\nupperclassmen to live on campus for the first<br />\ntime in recent years. Research facilities are<br />\nbeing built. But not on one plot of land is<br />\na center for the social well-being of students<br />\nbeing built. It's impossible to create a community feeling if the majority of students live<br />\noff-campus and if there's no place on campus to gather.<br />\nWhatever happened to the belief that a<br />\nhappy person helps to make a happy student? Perhaps the administration should<br />\nlook at the situation and make some<br />\nchanges. Realistically, though, that only will<br />\nhappen if students complain since the<br />\nadministration apparently doesn't care if<br />\ntheir guests are happy.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nShort but to the Point<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe University should fix the<br />\nGilman tower clock soon.

During my 10<br />\nminute wait inside of the office,<br />\nI saw one of the staff answer a<br />\nphone call and then type a<br />\nmemo with two fingers so she<br />\nwouldn't ruin her freshly<br />\npolished nails. Another woman<br />\nrefused to give a new set of lottery tickets to a girl that didn't<br />\nbring the stubs to her completed tickets. She, too, had<br />\nbeen waiting in line for an<br />\nhour. The woman insisted that<br />\nshe must go home and get the<br />\nstubs or \"just forget it.\"<br />\nThis encounter left me with<br />\na bitter taste in my mouth. I<br />\nhave true sympathy for the<br />\nstudents who have dealt with<br />\nthe Housing Office personnel<br />\non a more regular basis.<br />\nLisa Tabor<br /><br />\nPlease Don't Hang Up<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAfter reading last week's article on the housing report, I<br />\nfeel impelled to support their<br />\nfindings.<br />\nI am a senior and have lived<br />\nin University Housing for three<br />\nyears. Thus far, I have been<br />\nlucky and have not had major<br />\nmaintenance problems.<br />\nBut many times, I have had<br />\nminor problems, such as a dripping toilet, a clogged bathtub or<br />\nno hot water. The toilet and<br />\nbathtub were fixed within two<br />\ndays. More than one time,<br />\nhowever, there was no hot<br />\nwater in the entire building for<br />\nseveral days. Repeated calls to<br />\nthe office for information drew<br />\nnothing except snotty answers<br />\nsuch as, \"We already know.<br />\nSeveral people have already<br />\ncalled,\" and they hung up<br />\nbefore I could even thank them.<br />\nCalls about a broken elevator<br />\nreceived the same reply.<br />\nI must admit that the entire<br />\nHousing Office is not at fault.<br />\nThe maintenance usually reply<br />\nto a call and adequately fix<br /><br />\nFWD FACTORIAL<br /><br />\nwhat they can. The mailroom<br />\nclerk has been courteous to me,<br />\nthough, some mail I have gotten through the Housing Office<br />\nshould have been delivered to<br />\nmy mailbox. But the office<br />\nstaff is discourteous, snobbish,<br />\nsnotty, and generally unwilling<br />\nto extend common courtesy to<br />\npaying tenants. I believe<br />\nchanges must be made in their<br />\nmanner of operation. I hope<br />\nfor the sake of future tenants<br />\nthey are made soon.<br />\nLaury Hutt<br /><br />\nA List of Damages<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nWhat about a Revolt?<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nEvery week I read the NewsLetter, and every week I see the<br />\nadministration doing something<br />\nthat hurts the students.<br />\nFirst, they try to close the<br />\nHut. Then they decide to close<br />\nthe Rat and ask the students<br />\nwhat they would think of an<br />\nARA restaurant. They also<br />\nclose WJ HU without telling<br />\nanyone what's going on until<br />\ntwo weeks before. They run a<br />\nhousing office that is totally<br />\nunresponsive to the students.<br />\nThey allow security to be a nonentity. And last week, I read a<br />\nletter from a student who was<br />\ntreated coldly by the Office of<br />\nAdvising and Counseling after<br />\nher father died.<br />\nI could continue listing problems, but the News-Letter<br />\ncan't afford the space.<br />\nWhy do we take this?

We have been<br />\npushed around too much.<br />\nLet's fight back now.<br /><br />\nThe report by Rich Gordon<br />\nand Kenny Lee on University<br />\nHousing services brought out<br />\nthe glaring deficiency of the<br />\nHousing Office staff. Living in<br />\nWolman this past year, nearly<br />\nall encounters with the Housing<br />\nOffice personnel have been<br />\nunpleasant experiences. One<br />\noccasion immediately comes to<br />\nmind.<br />\nAt the end of my first two<br />\nweeks in University Housing, I<br />\nbrought a letter down to the<br />\nHousing Office requesting a list<br />\nof damages to my apartment as<br />\nthe off-campus housing booklet<br />\nsays every tenant has a right to<br />\ndo.<br />\nI handed the letter to the<br />\nsecretary explaining its contents. My request was met with<br />\nsnickering and the explanation<br />\nthat \"we don't do that kind of<br />\nthing.\"<br />\nLloyd Melnick<br />\nI have had similar encounters<br />\nschool<br />\nof<br />\nsince the first month<br />\nand am glad someone is finally Advising Advising<br />\ntrying to remedy this problem.<br />\nBut in an acknowledged To the Editor:<br />\napathetic student body, such as<br />\nHopkins, this can be hard. I<br />\nConcerning Terri Glubin's<br />\nurge everybody who has had letter of April 6, I am appalled<br />\ncontact, whether good or bad, at the lack of sympathy which<br />\nwith the Housing Office to the Office of Advising and<br />\nvoice their opinion.<br />\nCounseling has for those<br />\nstudents who have suffered reKen Connor cent losses of close family<br /><br />\nas<br /><br />\notAmith<br /><br />\nclmt.lopeci 11_4*u*<br /><br />\nmembers. I fail to understand<br />\nwhy special circumstances cannot be allowed for students who<br />\nobviously have just undergone<br />\na tragedy.<br />\nI know two such students:<br />\none who attends Hopkins and<br />\none who attends another<br />\nprestigious university. While my<br />\nfriend here probably will take<br />\nseveral incompletes this<br />\nsemester because of the Office<br />\nof Advising and Counseling's<br />\ninability to arrange for alternative ways to make-up work,<br />\nmy friend at Georgetown was<br />\ntreated with care and<br />\nunderstanding. Not only did<br />\nshe gain special exemptions<br />\nfrom mid-term exams, which<br />\nshe made up a few weeks later,<br />\nbut she was able to apply for<br />\noverseas study after the<br />\ndeadline for applications.<br />\nThis lack of cooperation on<br />\nbehalf of the Office of Advising and Counseling underlines<br />\na significant problem at<br />\nHopk:ns. Each year several<br />\nstudents will be confronted with<br />\npainful losses of people dear to<br />\nthem. As Bill Zulch told Robin,<br />\nfour others have faced the same<br />\ntragedy this year. A policy<br />\nneeds to be drafted and implemented allowing students to<br />\ncontinue their studies under<br />\ncirunfortunate<br />\nthese<br />\ncumstances. Informing professors is an obvious necessity<br />\nwhich the Office realizes, but<br />\nthe student needs further direction and support. Allow a<br />\nspecial make-up period, or<br />\nperhaps eliminate certain<br />\nassignments.<br /><br />\nIn addition, the Office of<br />\nAdvising and Counseling needs<br />\nto make major improvements<br />\nin the way it currently communicates with students. As a<br />\nsophomore, at times, I have<br />\nbeen discouraged about my<br />\ncourse choices, but the Office<br />\nhas been utterly unreceptive<br />\nand completely unknowledgeable about what courses are required, what courses are about,<br />\netc. I find the Office completely devoid of emotion when it<br />\ncomes to discussing specific<br />\nacademic problems at Hopkins,<br />\nwhether they involve a certain<br />\nprofessor or the education at<br />\nHopkins in general. The Office<br />\ndoesn't care if students at<br />\nHopkins are satisfied in terms<br />\nof academics, special considerations, or even transfer credits.<br />\nWhile I urge the immediate<br />\ndrafting and implementation of<br />\na policy giving special consideration to those students<br />\nwho suffer the passing of a relation, I also plea for changing<br />\nthe manner in which the Office<br />\nof Advising and Counseling<br />\nfunctions. It should be more<br />\ncommunicative, more supportive, more aware, and more<br />\ncooperative.<br />\nUntil these changes take<br />\nplace, it appears that the best<br />\nway to deal with any situation<br />\nat this school is to do it<br />\nyourself. Speak to professors<br />\nyourselves about specific problems.

Fielding<br />\nonly two professors at the moment, the Institute is planning<br />\n.a major expansion with the addition of a new director and<br />\n.another professor. If a poll<br />\nwere taken of Homewood students, however, the Institute<br />\nwould probably vie with Evergreen House for the dubious<br />\ndistinction of being the least<br />\nknown part of Hopkins. While<br />\nthe rest of you were on Spring<br />\nBreak, this writer decided to<br />\nfind out a little more of what<br />\nthe Institute had to offer.<br />\nTo say that the Institute is<br />\nnot a major part of the Medical<br />\nSchool would be a misconception. Anyone who has been to<br />\nthe top floor of Welch Medical<br />\nLibrary has seen the collection<br />\nof old medical instruments and<br />\nmemorabilia. The Smithsonian<br />\nit is not, but nevertheless, the<br />\ncollection lends a certain atmosphere to the floor. One wing of<br />\nthe floor also houses a small<br />\nlibrary which contains books<br />\ndating back more than a century and a half.<br />\nIn Dr. Jerome J. Bylebyl's<br />\nopinion, the history of<br />\nmedicine is a popular and interesting subject. Modern<br />\nmedicine has been in existence<br />\nand there is a need for health<br />\nprofessionals to develop a<br />\nperspective. \"It is important<br />\nfor medical people to appreciate how they got there,\"<br />\nBylebyl stated.<br />\nEarly medicine meant a lot of<br />\nthings to different peoples. For<br />\nthe ancient Greeks, medicine<br />\nwas a craft rather than a profession. Physicians were regarded as craftsmen, much like<br />\ncarpenters or shoemakers. The<br />\nclout and prestige enjoyed by<br />\nthe medical profession today<br />\nwould have been something<br />\ntotally foreign. The Greeks<br />\nthought about health differently, and that contributed to their<br />\nconcept of physicians. They<br />\nstressed prevention and believed<br />\nthat a diseased state was caused<br />\nby a multitute of factors. Thus,<br />\nonce a person was sick, the<br />\nphysician could do little more<br />\nthan acknowledge the fact and<br />\nprescribe rest.<br />\nThe Romans were less medically oriented than the Greeks.<br />\nEven though they literally ruled<br /><br />\nthe known world, their medical<br />\nphilosophy relied largely on the<br />\nuse of home remedies. After<br />\nestablishing contact with the<br />\nGreeks, the Romans brought<br />\nover many Greek physicians.<br />\nThe famous physician and<br />\nmedical scholar, Galan, was<br />\nknown to have treated many<br />\nRoman patriarchs. With the<br />\ncollapse of the Roman Empire,<br />\nthe recording of medical history<br />\neffectively stopped. The early<br />\nMiddle Ages were a Dark Age<br />\nin terms of medical progress.<br />\nNothing much is really known<br />\nabout what types of people<br />\ngave medical aid nor what<br />\ntreatments were common. We<br />\ndo know, however, that in the<br />\nlatter part of the Middle Ages,<br />\nmany doctors, especially<br />\nsurgeons, were also barbers.<br />\nThus, physicians were still<br />\ncraftsmen.<br /><br />\nInstitute for the History of Medicine<br /><br />\nActing Director Dr. Jerome J.<br />\nBylebyl.<br /><br />\nIn the late Middle Ages,<br />\nleaders made the political decision to make medicine a learned profession. The chartering<br />\nof medical schools first began<br />\nin the Italian city-states<br />\nsometime between 1250 and<br />\n1300. Slowly this standard was<br />\nadopted throughout Europe.<br />\nThough their knowledge was<br />\nprimitive compared to ours, it<br />\nwas a real attempt to teach the<br />\nstandard medical techniques of<br />\nthe times.<br />\nAccording to Bylebyl, the<br />\nrevolution in medicine occurred<br />\nin the late 19th century. The<br />\ngerm theory had a tremendous<br />\nimpact on the health profession. The appreciation of<br />\nmicro-organisms as causes of<br />\ndisease led to greater understanding and better methods of<br />\nprevention and treatment.<br />\nWhen the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity School of Medicine<br />\nopened in 1893 it was a pioneer<br />\nin medical instruction. At the<br />\ntime, there were more than 150<br />\nmedical schools in the U.S. The<br />\nbasic science curriculum usually<br />\nlasted one year, and this instruction only entailed what we<br /><br />\nJHMI Office of Public Affairs<br /><br />\nAdministrative Assistant Mary Moore in the Rare Books Room.<br /><br />\nwould now call the pre-med ternships were first introduced<br />\ncurriculum. Some schools only by Hopkins. In essence, Hophad six-month curricula.

Welch was the<br />\ntors. Thus, as opposed to single most important man in<br />\ninstruction by academic doctors, the history of modern Amerithe knowledge was acquired in can medicine. Besides his cona more passive and textbook tributions to Hopkins, Welch<br />\nstyle. As late as 1870, a Har- was president of the American<br />\nvard medical student could fail Medical Association as well as<br />\nfour of nine subjects, still AAAS (American Association<br />\nobtain his degree, and set up a for the Advancement of Scipractice anywhere in Massa- ence).

Published since 1933,<br />\nthis publication, presently<br />\nunder the editorial supervision<br />\nof Caroline Hannaway, is the<br />\nleading journal in the study of<br />\nhistory of medicine in the<br />\nUnited States.

Now, director Rob<br />\nReiner and collaborators<br />\nChristopher Guest, Michael<br />\nMcKean and Harry Shearer<br />\nhave created This is Spinal Tap,<br />\na movie that weaves virtually<br />\nevery element of rock-and-roll<br />\nmedia culture into a sharp,<br />\nknowing sendup of the genre,<br />\nand, by extension, of another<br />\npop culture hybrid: the rock<br />\ndocumentary.<br />\nEmploying 16-millimeter<br />\ncameras and a completely improvised \"screenplay\", Reiner<br />\nand company trace the (mostly<br />\nbad)fortunes of Spinal Tap, a<br />\nfictitious British band whose<br />\nroots seem to extend to every<br />\nwatershed musical movement<br />\nsince the Invasion: starting out<br />\nas the Thamesmen,a Herman's<br />\nHermit-type outfit appearing<br />\non the BBC show Pop, Look<br />\nand Listen;jumping on the hippie bandwagon in 1967 with<br />\ntheir first American hit (Listen<br />\nto the) Flower People; Experimenting with glitter in the<br />\nearly 70's (in concept albums<br />\nlike The Sun Never Sweats);<br /><br />\nand finally settling into semiobscure middle age with that<br />\nold reliable, heavy metal. The<br />\nmost disturbing thing about this<br />\nchronology is that it suggests<br />\nthat were the Beatles still<br />\ntogether today, they might be<br />\nBlack Sabbath.<br />\nThere are other echoes of the<br />\nBeatles in the group's backstage<br />\nlife. Spinal Tap is fronted by<br />\nNigel Tufnel(Guest)and David<br />\nSt. Hubbins (McKean), two<br />\n\"almost poets, like Byron or<br />\nShelley.\" whose continual<br />\ncreative differences threaten the<br />\nexistence of the band. Not the<br />\nleast of these differences<br />\nrevolve around St. Hubbin's<br />\ngirlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick), who, a la Yoko Ono,<br />\nkeeps making artistic suggestions and business decisions<br />\nbased on the band's astrological<br />\ncharts.<br />\nThe plot of the movie concerns Spinal Tap's 1982 comeback tour of America, and the<br />\nsimultaneous release of its first<br />\nalbum in six years, Smell the<br />\nglove. Both the tour and the<br />\nalbum are overseen by the<br />\nband's manager, Ian Faith<br />\n(Tony Hendra), a youthful<br />\nlooking, well educated Briton<br />\nwho carries a cricket bat as an<br />\n\"oh, what's the word..yes. Affectation.\" As the film<br />\ndocuments Spinal Tap's<br />\njourney through the States, it<br />\naccumulates a mass of telling<br /><br />\ndetails and witty .sight gags:<br />\nplates of unscrewed Oreos as<br />\npart of a backstage buffet; a<br />\nrecord autographing session for<br />\nwhich no fans show up; Nigel's<br />\nwireless guitar, which has an<br />\nunfortunate habit of pulling in<br />\nradio signals during solos; a trip<br />\nthrough the catacombs of a<br />\nCleveland auditorium, where<br />\nthe band gets lost between the<br />\ndressing room and the stage.<br />\nThe film has structural influences as well, most notably<br />\nLet it Be, The Kids are Alright,<br />\nand The Last Waltz. (One of<br />\nthe slyest bits of parody is<br />\nReiner's own performance as<br />\nMarty DiBergi, the somewhat<br />\ntorpid, obsequious director<br />\nwho decides to make a film<br />\nabout Spinal Tap, and who<br />\nputs himself into the picture as<br />\ndoggedly as Martin Scorsese<br />\ndid at the Band's \"last waltz.\"<br />\nIn his thick beard and<br />\nparamilitary peaked cap,<br />\nReiner looks like every<br />\nHollywood upstart from<br />\nGeorge Lucas to Steven<br />\nSpielberg.) Some problems<br />\ncome when the movie begins to<br />\nsneak away from documentary<br />\ninto docudrama, as in certain<br />\nparty scenes and Nigel-David<br />\nconfrontations, when the actors<br />\nstart behaving too much like actors, and not enough like people whose private lives are<br />\n(somewhat randomly) being<br />\ncaught on film.<br /><br />\nPress Photo<br /><br />\nHowever, most of the performances are excellent, and one<br />\nis classic. Hendra and Guest use<br />\nthe gifts for caricature they<br />\ndisplayed so well as members of<br />\nthe National Lampoon stable;<br />\nMcKean shows a flair for accents and an ability to mock<br />\nrock platitudes without condescension. But the biggest<br />\npleasure is Paul Shaffer, in a<br />\nbrief role as Artie Fufkin,<br />\n\"Midwest Promotions Coordinator, Polymer Records.\"<br />\nLike the actors in shows such as<br />\n\"SCTV,\" Shaffer seems to<br />\nbring complete knowledge of<br />\nhis character's shallowness in-<br /><br />\nto the performance without<br />\novertly displaying it.<br />\nThe only real flaw is the<br />\nmusic. The songs are bad\u2014yes,<br />\nthey're supposed to be; but<br />\nthey're not inspired enough to<br />\nbe hilariously bad, and because<br />\nof that they don't serve the<br />\nsatiric purpose for which they<br />\nseem to be intended.

Police Chief John<br />\nBrady suspects a link between<br />\nthe killings and the work of<br />\nProfessor Gwen Parkinson at<br />\nGalesburg College. However,<br />\nBrady's accusations are<br />\ndismissed because he bears<br /><br />\nsome long standing grudge<br />\nagainst the Professor's supposedly dead mentor.<br />\nMeanwhile, Brady's son<br />\nPeter has been participating in<br />\nDr. Parkinson's research to<br />\nearn the money he needs to<br />\napply to college. After a paricularly nauseating treatment,<br />\nPeter begins to exhibit some<br />\nvery strange symptoms. It's not<br />\nhard to guess the rest.

Laughlin gives us<br />\nevery traditional element of the<br />\ngenre: the mad scientist, the<br />\n'Halloween-masked killer, the<br /><br />\ngruff \"seen it all\" cop from the<br />\nbig city, the body in the<br />\nbathtub, and the sappy happy<br />\nending.

According to Athletic Director<br />\nBob Scott, this was Hopkins'<br />\nlowest scoring game since 1942,<br />\nwhen they were defeated by<br />\nPrinceton, 4-2.<br />\nWith Hopkins and Carolina<br />\naveraging more than 14 and 13<br />\ngoals a game, respectively,<br />\nmany had expected the contest<br />\nto be a shoot-out. It was not,<br />\nhowever, as both teams were<br />\nunable to effectively make the<br />\ntransition from defense to offense. Indeed, at many times, it<br />\nappeared as if both teams were<br />\ntrying to \"sit on the ball,\"<br />\nwaiting for the defense to make<br />\na mistake.<br />\n\"A classic dogfight\" is what<br />\nBlue Jay Coach Don Zimmerman called it, saying, \"it might<br />\nnot be the best thing for the<br />\nfans to watch, but the players<br />\nknow they've been in a game.\"<br />\nHopkins' starting line-up was<br />\nwhat was expected, with Peter<br />\nScott, Willy Odenthal, Brian<br />\nWood on attack. At midfield<br />\nwere Rich Glancy, Del Dressel,<br />\nand John Krumenacker. Guy<br />\nMatricciani, Steve Dubin, and<br />\nJohn DeTomasso were on<br />\ndefense, while Larry Quinn<br />\nguarded the goal.<br />\nFor the first several minutes<br />\nof the game, both teams were<br />\ntrying to feel each other out.<br />\nOn their second possession, the<br />\nJays' middies took nothing but<br />\noutside bounce shots with the<br /><br />\nno one picked him up, Haus<br />\ntook the shot and netted his second goal of the season.<br />\nThe Tar Heels wasted little<br />\ntime in scoring again as they let<br />\nloose attackman Mac Ford.<br />\nFord, Carolina's leading scorer<br />\nwith 14 goals, tried to take<br />\nDeTommaso one-on-one as he<br />\ncircled from behind the net to<br />\nQuinn's right side. With<br />\nDeTommaso checking him<br />\ntightly, Ford jumped and shot<br />\nweakly. Quinn, expecting a<br />\nstrong shot, was caught by surprise and allowed the ball to<br />\nskip beneath his stick. Still, a<br />\ngoal is a goal, and Carolina led<br />\n2-1.<br />\nNear the end of the first<br />\nperiod, Hopkins scored what<br />\nturned out to be a very important goal. With less than a<br />\nminute remaining, the Blue<br />\nJays brought the ball<br />\ndownfield. The midfield worked the ball around and found<br />\nWood 10 yards from the left<br />\nside of the goal. Taking one<br />\nstep, he fired high and hard,<br />\nonly to have the shot stopped<br />\nby Mealey. The ball popped<br />\nloose, however, and Tucker<br />\nwas able to scoop it into the<br />\nvacated net.<br />\nOnly one second was showing on the clock, though, and<br />\nfor many upperclassmen and<br />\nalumni it must have brought<br />\nback memories of the Championship game against Carolina<br />\nthree years ago when two<br />\nsimilar goals were disallowed.<br />\nFortunately for Hopkins, the<br />\nscoreboard time was the<br />\nofficial time. The goal counted<br />\nand tied the score at 2-2.<br />\nIn the second quarter, the<br /><br />\nDefender Steve Dubin and goalie Larry Quinn led the Blue Jays as they held North Carolina to three goals<br />\nlast Saturday.<br /><br />\nMidway through the period, stay.

Crowe<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins baseball<br />\nteam swept a doubleheader<br />\nfrom MAC Southeastern division rival Ursinus College last<br />\nSaturday and pushed its division<br />\nrecord to 4-2. In its only other<br />\ngame last week, the Blue Jays<br />\nlost to Western Maryland 6-3.<br />\nHopkins' overall record now<br />\nstands at 10-8.<br />\nAfter splitting the first two<br />\ncrucial MAC doubleheaders,<br />\nthe Blue Jays traveled to Collegeville, Pa. in hopes of taking<br />\nboth games from Ursinus and<br />\nkeeping a Southeastern division<br />\ntitle a possibility.<br />\nIn the first game, the story<br />\nwas Mark Campbell (2-3, 2.25<br />\nERA). He went the distance,<br />\ngiving up only one hit and striking out six on his way to 6-0<br />\nvictory.<br />\nUnlike many of the squad's<br />\nprevious wins, this game was<br />\nnever in doubt, as the Blue Jays<br />\nchipped away for runs<br />\nthroughout and played one of<br />\nits few errorless games.<br />\nIn the top of the first inning,<br />\nHopkins jumped on top 1-0.<br />\nWith two out, Andy Lachance<br />\nwas hit by a pitch and stole second. Willie Raedle singled<br />\nLachance home with the first<br />\nrun.<br />\nIn the second inning, the<br />\nBlue Jays scored again. Jimmy<br />\nCardwell led off with a single<br />\nand stole second. After Pete<br />\nBlohm flied out and Mike<br />\nGoudy struck out, Bobby<br />\nCardwell singled to center, to<br />\nscore his brother.<br />\nHopkins scored again in the<br />\nfourth inning to make it a 3-0<br />\ngame. The scoring continued in<br />\nthe fifth, as Craig Brooks<br />\ndoubled with one out. After a<br />\nfielder's choice by Jimmy Cardwell, Blohm singled home the<br />\nfourth run. Then, one out later,<br />\nBobby Cardwell drove home<br />\nbrother Jimmy with a single.<br />\nThe Jays finished the scoring<br />\nin the sixth, adding a single run<br />\nto make it a 6-0 victory.<br />\nThe second game was a<br />\nheart-stopper. Ursinus came<br />\nstorming back from its first<br />\ngame to score five times in the<br />\nbottom of the first inning.<br />\nDavid Provost (2-0, 3.4 ERA)<br />\nstarted the game, but only<br />\nlasted one-third of an inning.<br />\nAfter striking out the first hitter, Pro became wild and the<br />\ndefense became shaky. Four<br />\nwalks, two errors, a pass-ball,<br />\nand two hits later, Ursinus was<br />\nstaked to an early 5-0 lead.<br />\nGeoff Bender came on to pitch<br />\nout of the inning and shut down<br />\nthe Ursinus offense for the rest<br />\nof the game, pitching 6 2/3 innings of brilliant shut out relief.<br />\nThe Blue Jays did not quit,<br />\nhowever. In the fifth, Jimmy<br />\nCardwell led off with a walk.<br />\nAn error on a Campbell ground<br />\nball put runners on first and second. A single by Bobby Cardwell loaded the b'ases. Scott<br />\nBurns followed with a double,<br />\nscoring Jim Cardwell and<br />\nCampbell. Jon Meltzer hit a<br />\nsacrifice fly to right field to<br />\nmake the score 5-3. An RBI<br />\ngrounder to shortstop by<br /><br />\nWilly Raedle slides safely into second base against Western Maryland.<br /><br />\nLachance scored Burns to make<br />\nit a one-run ball game.<br />\nThe Jays didn't let up. In the<br />\nsixth, Brooks led off with a<br />\nsingle and Bill Miller and Jimmy Cardwell reached with<br />\nwalks. With the bases loaded,<br />\nCampbell hit a sacrifice fly to<br />\nscore Brooks and tie the game.<br />\nAn error by the catcher allowed Miller to score the go ahead<br />\nrun.<br />\nBender was cruising right<br />\nalong, until the bottom of the<br />\nseventh. He easily got the first<br />\ntwo outs with a strike out and<br />\na grounder to shortstop. But,<br />\nthe next hitter doubled, putting<br />\nthe tying run in scoring position. Then came near disaster.<br />\nBender threw a wild pitch in the<br />\ndirt, that skidded away from<br />\nCatcher Miller.<br />\nThrowing off his mask,<br />\nMiller searched for the ball, but<br />\ncouldn't locate it. As infielders<br />\npointed in the direction of the<br />\nball and Miller continued to<br />\nsearch, the runner went to third<br /><br />\ndle singled him home.<br />\nWestern Maryland went on<br />\ntop again in the third, as Fearer<br />\nwalked two, made an error, and<br />\nsurrendered a hit.<br />\nIn the fourth, WM scored<br />\nagain\u2014their only earned run\u2014<br />\nto pull ahead by two runs.<br />\nThe Jays closed the gap to<br />\none run in the sixth. Raedle led<br />\noff with a single. A fielder's<br />\nchoice by Brooks erased Raedle<br />\nand Lachance singled to create<br />\na first and third situation.<br />\nCoach Robert Babb brought in<br />\nMeltzer to pinch hit. He hit a<br />\nhard smash on the ground to<br />\nthe second baseman who went<br />\nfor a double play. Lachance<br />\nslid in hard to second base to<br />\nslow the relay to first base and<br />\nbreak up the double play.<br />\nBrooks scored on the fielder's<br />\nchoice.<br />\nHopkins tied the game in the<br />\neighth, when Raedle was hit by<br />\na pitch and stole second.<br />\nBrooks bunted him to third and<br />\nLachance singled him home.<br /><br />\njob. Cardwell leads the team<br />\nwith 11 runs scored and Landolphi leads the team in stolen<br />\nbases(8 for 8), walks (15), and<br />\nis third in runs scored (9).<br />\nWith the sweep of Ursinus,<br />\nthe Blue Jays are in first place<br />\nin the Southeastern division and<br />\nare in a position to control its<br />\nplayoff future. The team has<br />\ntwo more crucial doubleheaders<br />\nagainst Washington College<br />\n(Saturday)and Haverford College (April 28). If Hopkins can<br />\nsweep these doubleheaders,<br />\nthey will be no worse off than<br />\na tie for first at the season's<br />\nconclusion.
