Ernst Toiler's \"No<br />\nMore Peace\", this year's presentation, contains more unusual features<br />\nthan any other production ever offered to the public by the Barnstormers. The play, because of its<br />\ntheme dealing with the destruction<br />\nof war, gave rise to many unexpected<br />\nproduction problems.<br />\nThese dilemmas, naturally, had to<br />\nbe solved with as little cost and with<br />\nthe best results possible. Time and<br />\ntime again the master minds of Al<br />\nAgrin and Vic Victoroff, not to mention those of the entire production<br />\nstaff, were stumped. However, in this<br />\ncase, as in almost all cases, ingenuity<br />\nwas triumphant. Devices that have<br />\nnever before been used on the Barnstormers' or any other stage will be<br />\nused to produce the necessary sound<br />\neffects. How many pails of flash<br />\nbulbs and explosive powder will be<br />\nconsumed and how many plates of<br />\nglass will be broken, and what number of shots will be fired must, of<br />\ncourse, remain a mystery until the<br />\nactual presentation. However, one<br />\nthing is certain. \"No More Peace\"<br />\nwill offer the greatest amount of action that its producer's can put into it.<br />\nNevertheless, not all the problems<br />\nof production were concerned with<br />\nsound effects. A mysterious poison<br />\ngas had to be developed and it was,<br />\nindeed. The lighting effects demanded<br />\na great deal of thought and care.<br />\nFor this purpose Francis Carlson was<br />\ndrafted.

He said that all nations are equally guilty of this war<br />\nand advised Americans to keep poise,<br />\nsanity, and perspective. According to<br />\nhim we should not keep out ears<br />\nglued to the radio nor should we<br />\ndevour propaganda about the war.<br />\nThe first casualty in war is truth,<br />\nthe second, democracy. The people<br />\nare like a tuning fork, if it is constantly hammered it loses pitch.<br />\nWe must view the foreign situation in an unprejudiced light and<br />\nremember that Europe is not a monopoly of vice and that the United<br />\nStates is not a monopoly of virtues.<br />\nEuropean blood flows in our veins<br />\nand although we seem more peaceful,<br />\nthe reason is that we are separated<br />\nfrom them.<br />\nIn order to stay out of war, Dr<br />\nButtrick said, \"Keep resolute good<br />\nwill and the determination to understand . . . The German people are<br />\nespecially essentially human and<br />\ncharacteristically kind.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr Sidney Painter, acting chairman<br />\nof the Social Science group, announced the change in policy after a<br />\nmeeting of the fifteen faculty members in the group was held last<br />\nTuesday, December 5.<br />\nThe complete announcement contained three provisions:<br />\n\"(1) That there will be a reading<br />\nperiod extending for three weeks<br />\nfrom the beginning of the second<br />\nterm (February 1 to February 22)<br />\nduring which all classes composed<br />\nchiefly of Juniors and Seniors shall<br />\nbe suspended.<br />\n\"(2) That Juniors are to be given<br />\nsuch special reading as the instructor<br />\nmay consider best suited to their<br />\nneeds.<br />\n\"(3) That any instructor who does<br />\nnot consider it advisable to suspend<br />\nhis courses may hold classes during<br />\nthe reading period.\"<br />\nAlthough, according to the third<br />\nprovision, classes may be held during<br />\nthis year's reading period as in the<br />\npast, the inclusion of Juniors in the<br />\nplan will lessen the number of classes<br />\nheld, it is believed. Formerly, with<br />\nJuniors excluded from the readiiig<br />\nperiod, classes falling under t',e<br />\njurisdiction of the Social Science<br />\ngroup were largely made up of nonSeniors.<br />\n\"The plan is an experiment,\" said<br />\nDr Painter. \"The group hopes that<br />\nthe inclusion of Juniors will serve a<br />\ndouble purpose\u2014Juniors will be given<br />\na chance to read books outside the<br />\nregular reading for specific courses<br />\nand Seniors will be able to devote<br />\nmore time to work for which the<br />\nreading period was introduced if<br />\nfewer classes are held.\"<br />\n<br />\nHonor Commission<br />\nappoints new men<br />\nSix new appointments to the Honor commission were announced last<br />\nTuesday afternoon by Raymond<br />\nCluster, incumbent president. These<br />\nselections are subject to the approval of the Student council which<br />\nmeets today.

However, no<br />\ndefinite schedule of meetings for<br />\nthis year has been announced by the<br />\ncommission as yet.<br />\nWith the coming of pre-holiday<br />\nexaminations, Cluster stated that he<br />\nwished to emphasize the great importance attached to the enforcement of the Honor system.<br />\n\"It is just as much a part of the<br />\nhonor system to report a violation<br />\nas it is to avoid personal violation\",<br />\nhe said. \"The system cannot possibly work unless all violations are<br />\nreported.\"<br />\n<br />\nWar and Peace<br />\nGreenfield leads<br />\nMC forum<br />\nDr Kent Roberts Greenfield, acting as chairman at the International<br />\nRelation club's symposium on world<br />\naffairs last Saturday, placed two<br />\ngeneral questions before the six men<br />\npresent at the speakers' table. Opening the discussion on \"A program<br />\nfor Peace after the Present War\",<br />\nhe asked \"What kind of peace do we<br />\nrequire as a nation?\" and \"To what<br />\nextent is such a peace possible?\"<br />\nAt the morning session, Which<br />\nlasted from 10:30 to 12:30, Dr W<br />\nStull Holt, professor of American<br />\nhistory; Dr A 0 Lovejoy, professor<br />\nemeritus of philosophy; and Dr Franz<br />\nMichael, of the Page school of international relations, discussed the<br />\nAmerican point of view towards a<br />\npeace and the general question of the<br />\nstruggle between liberty and authority in creating a state of international system for Europe.<br />\n\"Obviously we want peace\", said<br />\nDr Holt, who opened the discussion, \"and most public opinion would<br />\nlike to see peace with justice. Most<br />\nof all the present administration<br />\nwould like to see the world organized so that wars are kept at a minimum. There has been no clear indication of how America will pay the<br />\nprice for a peace it wants. But the<br />\nessential thing is to adopt some kind<br />\nof a program if we want peace.\"<br />\nQuestions from the other speakers<br />\nand from the floor followed Dr Holt's<br />\nintroductory remarks; the general<br />\npoint of the discussion centered<br />\naround the advisability of the United<br />\nStates' entering the war, and the<br />\nprobable effect of such an action on<br />\nthis country's bargaining power in<br />\nthe peace conference. Dr Holt contended that, \"if the dictators win,<br />\nwe will become more dictatorial. If<br />\nthe world continues on this basis,<br />\nwe will be involved in this war or<br />\nsome future one. We will overcome<br />\nthis trend if we act now, and at<br />\nthe same time, we will make unnecessary paying a higher price for<br />\nstaying out of war\".<br />\nDr Lovejoy provoked a discussion of economic determinism as a<br />\nfactor in creating crises in foreign<br />\naffairs. He said he believed most<br />\neconomic difficulties could be settled peacefully and suggested that<br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col. 4)<br />\n<br />\n'Must have promises<br />\nimmediately'\u2014 Don Kirkwood<br />\nBusted from Busse the B S A wants to save itself with Savitt,<br />\nJan, this week and asks the student body for 300 \"promises to go.\"<br />\nConsolidated Radio Artists have promised to keep February 21 on the<br />\nJan Savitt \"open\" list until today.

It seems that two of<br />\nthe Hopkins students most addicted to<br />\nthese jitterbug cuttings are the redoubtable Henry Anthony and the<br />\ninimitable George Newton. \"That<br />\nTony just loves it,\" said Sandy.<br />\nOther novel facts of the Hopkins<br />\nclip and snip trade are that only<br />\nseven of Sandy's customers get German haircuts, while most student<br />\nbarberees prefer to read rather than<br />\nsmoke.

It is seldom, too seldom<br />\nwe think, that the undergraduate has that privilege.<br />\nBut besides the natural anticipation and desire to<br />\nhear Dr Bowman, the plenary head of the University,<br />\nhis skill as a lecturer, and his authoritative command<br />\nof the subject he discussed brought men from every<br />\nclass to listen and note.<br />\nHis is one of a group of lectures on the hackgrQlud<br />\nfor the war in Europe now going into ominous<br />\nphase with the spread of the fighting extended to<br />\nRussia and Finland. The threat inherent in the active military participation of Russia in the West, defined by Britain as against the Western Coalition adds<br />\na menace to the cause of compromise and peace that<br />\nis incalculable at this moment. Every day brings new<br />\ndevelopments, new problems, new dilemnas from across<br />\nseas that confirm in article, headline, and quotation,<br />\nthe possibility that more and more nations will be<br />\ndragged into the conflict.<br />\nMen of qualified reputation, such as Dr Bowman,<br />\nare entitled to speak to us, and to explain to us \u2022what<br />\nthese things mean, and why they should happen, and<br />\nwhat can be done, if anything, about them. To that<br />\nend we at the Johns Hopkins are exceedingly fortunate<br />\nto have with us so many prominent faculty members<br />\nconsidered even by their colleagues with respect for<br />\ntheir knowledge and perspicuity. Dr Joseph T Singewald, jr, and Dr Kent Roberts Greenfield enjoy such<br />\ndistinction. They have been scheduled to give the<br />\nnext two lectures. Dr Singewald, eminent professor<br />\nof economic geology, will preside on December 14,<br />\nand Dr Greenfield on January II.<br />\nWe now realize, after the wonderful response to<br />\nthe first lecture series, that editorial space devoted<br />\nto acrimonious assaults on the \"inert student body\"<br />\nmight be better employed in describing more fully to<br />\nthem the plans for other assembly periods designed<br />\n\u2014as this is\u2014for their benefit and interest.<br />\n<br />\nEnd of<br />\nthe great<br />\ndebate<br />\n<br />\nOne good thing about<br />\nHopkins is that it has a<br />\nfaculty which seems to<br />\navoid studiously the practice of going around making remarks in public about<br />\nthe state of education and<br />\nwhat ought to be done about it. Compared with University of Chicago students for instance, who probably never know what their charming but occasionally<br />\ndisconcerting Dr Hutchins will suggest next, students<br />\nat Hopkins have much to be thankful for.<br />\nAnd one of the things they ought to be especially<br />\nthankful for is the new reading period plan. This<br />\nplan doesn't have the air of a scheme conceived by<br />\nan educational wizard; somehow most schemes which<br />\nstartle at first become dead letters within a year or<br />\ntwo. It looks more as if this plan were a sincere<br />\neffort on the part of the Social Science group to do<br />\naway with a few difficulties which arose when reading<br />\nperiods were begun in the University about seven or<br />\neight years ago.<br />\nSeniors now have a better chance of being relieved from the pressure of making up work or from<br />\ngiving up part of the reading period to attend classes;<br />\n<br />\nReading<br />\nPeriod,<br />\nJr.<br />\n<br />\nwith both Juniors and Seniors included in the plan,<br />\nmore classes will have majorities of those who can<br />\ntake advantage of the obviously valuable reading<br />\nperiod.<br />\nTo Juniors in the Social Science group, the plan<br />\nis of even more value. From one point of view,<br />\nwhich is too often disregarded, the Junior year in<br />\ncollege is as important as, if not more important than,<br />\nthe Senior year. It is in the Junior year that a<br />\ngeneral synthesizing of knowledge must take place.<br />\nThe first two years of a college curriculum are devoted to survey courses, introduction to new lines of<br />\nthought, and a general reorientation of views along<br />\nmore mature lines than those presented in prep schools.<br />\nThe senior year is devoted to final work for a degree.<br />\nStanding in between, the Junior year presents an excellent opportunity for examination of what has gone<br />\nbefore and for work in anticipation of what is to<br />\ncome.<br />\nAll too often, Juniors come to realize that some<br />\none phase of study has been neglected, that this or<br />\nthat book should have been read, or that some special<br />\nwork ought to be done in preparation for the future.<br />\nEven if he realizes this, the Junior seldom has time<br />\nto do more than keep up with his regular reading.<br />\nA reading period for at least the Social Science<br />\nJuniors will come as a happy solution to many of<br />\nthese problems.<br />\nWe can't make out this<br />\nyear's crop of seniors. For<br />\nweeks they battled to have<br />\ntheir Hullabaloo assured;<br />\nthey were willing to promise<br />\nanything\u2014well, almost anything if they could but have<br />\npermanent record of their final year at Hopkins. The<br />\noffenses, to hear the senior speak, were that the yearbook staff was inefficient, the officers didn't- cooperate<br />\nwith one another, the Administration was interfering,<br />\netc, etc.<br />\nWell, they finally got their Hullabaloo, and sat<br />\ndown and rubbed their hands over the \"victory.\"<br />\nNow, now when the coast is clear, and the photographers and staff are busy, they avoid their appointments for pictures as if the soliciting agent was an<br />\ninsurance salesman.<br />\nThe associate editors as well as the other members of the staff who have arranged the myriad details<br />\nconnected with the senior pictures know all the nasty<br />\nthings one can say about \"inefficiency . .. no cooperation . . independability . . . etc.\" Those boys know<br />\nall the old cracks and have invented sixteen new ones.<br />\nAnd if the seniors don't get down to their appointments on time there will be another senior assembly\u2014<br />\nat which all the seniors will sit on the platform, and<br />\nthe Hullabaloo staff will heckle them from the audience.<br />\nAll we can say is, it's<br />\nabout time. And we do mean<br />\nthe Honor commission. Why<br />\nappointments haven't been<br />\nmade until the beginning of<br />\nDecember to a group which<br />\nis supposed to keep the Honor system constantly before students is more than we<br />\ncan fathom.<br />\nAdd to that the fact that \"no definite schedule of<br />\nmeetings . . has been announced by the commission<br />\nas yet\" and a pretty sorry picture emerges. And<br />\nthe same old propaganda comes out of the commission; that is, when it comes at all. \"It is just as<br />\nmuch a part of the honor system to report a violation<br />\nas it is to avoid personal violation\". Well, we know<br />\nthat, and have known it for a long time.<br />\nTime was when the Honor commission filled the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER with stories\u2014not because the paper was<br />\nbeing used for propaganda purposes, but because the<br />\ncommission was news. Now it gets about as much<br />\nspace as the League of Nations in the daily press.<br />\nShort gasps, but nothing more, and those infrequent.<br />\nIt's a far cry from the commission as first founded<br />\nyear before last to today's commission. That first<br />\ngroup may have been enthusiastic because it was new,<br />\nbut it at least did something. It introduced the slip<br />\nsystem, and began to build up an attitude quite different<br />\nfrom that held by the sub-Student council Engineering Honor commission. That bunch of Honor system<br />\ncossacks was formed to play an only slightly minor<br />\nrole to the Student council's czar. It's job was to<br />\nferret out offenders and run them down.<br />\nThe AB and Business Honor commission brought a<br />\nnew and, we feel, a better attitude into play in enforcing the Honor system. No trials were held. The<br />\nnew commission was strictly an educational body.<br />\nAnd it worked.<br />\nBut it can't be kept going unless there is constant<br />\nwork. Appointments should -have been made at the<br />\nbeginning of the year; meetings should be held every<br />\nweek; and, above all, the Honor system should be<br />\nkept before the whole school all year long.<br />\nWe don't know whose fault it is, but we suspect the<br />\nHonor commission. Last year, a commission flourished even with part of the Student council in favor of<br />\ndoing away with. This year, the Student council is<br />\nmore than ready to support the commission, but there's<br />\nnothing to support. No plans, no publicity.<br />\nIt looks as if the commission needs more going<br />\nover than just appointing new members.<br />\n<br />\nRevolution<br />\nand<br />\nSabotage<br />\n<br />\nThe Commission<br />\nEmerges<br />\nat last<br />\n<br />\nPotpourri<br />\n(number Seven)<br />\n<br />\nBy Ned Hackett<br />\nIn<br />\n<br />\nand out of his Corner, J B in-<br />\n<br />\nsists upon realism.

Ernst Toiler's \"No<br />\nMore Peace\", this year's presentation, contains more unusual features<br />\nthan any other production ever offered to the public by the Barnstormers. The play, because of its<br />\ntheme dealing with the destruction<br />\nof war, gave rise to many unexpected<br />\nproduction problems.<br />\nThese dilemmas, naturally, had to<br />\nbe solved with as little cost and with<br />\nthe best results possible. Time and<br />\ntime again the master minds of Al<br />\nAgrin and Vic Victoroff, not to mention those of the entire production<br />\nstaff, were stumped. However, in this<br />\ncase, as in almost all cases, ingenuity<br />\nwas triumphant. Devices that have<br />\nnever before been used on the Barnstormers' or any other stage will be<br />\nused to produce the necessary sound<br />\neffects. How many pails of flash<br />\nbulbs and explosive powder will be<br />\nconsumed and how many plates of<br />\nglass will be broken, and what number of shots will be fired must, of<br />\ncourse, remain a mystery until the<br />\nactual presentation. However, one<br />\nthing is certain. \"No More Peace\"<br />\nwill offer the greatest amount of action that its producer's can put into it.<br />\nNevertheless, not all the problems<br />\nof production were concerned with<br />\nsound effects. A mysterious poison<br />\ngas had to be developed and it was,<br />\nindeed. The lighting effects demanded<br />\na great deal of thought and care.<br />\nFor this purpose Francis Carlson was<br />\ndrafted.

He said that all nations are equally guilty of this war<br />\nand advised Americans to keep poise,<br />\nsanity, and perspective. According to<br />\nhim we should not keep out ears<br />\nglued to the radio nor should we<br />\ndevour propaganda about the war.<br />\nThe first casualty in war is truth,<br />\nthe second, democracy. The people<br />\nare like a tuning fork, if it is constantly hammered it loses pitch.<br />\nWe must view the foreign situation in an unprejudiced light and<br />\nremember that Europe is not a monopoly of vice and that the United<br />\nStates is not a monopoly of virtues.<br />\nEuropean blood flows in our veins<br />\nand although we seem more peaceful,<br />\nthe reason is that we are separated<br />\nfrom them.<br />\nIn order to stay out of war, Dr<br />\nButtrick said, \"Keep resolute good<br />\nwill and the determination to understand . . . The German people are<br />\nespecially essentially human and<br />\ncharacteristically kind.\"<br /><br />\nDr Sidney Painter, acting chairman<br />\nof the Social Science group, announced the change in policy after a<br />\nmeeting of the fifteen faculty members in the group was held last<br />\nTuesday, December 5.<br />\nThe complete announcement contained three provisions:<br />\n\"(1) That there will be a reading<br />\nperiod extending for three weeks<br />\nfrom the beginning of the second<br />\nterm (February 1 to February 22)<br />\nduring which all classes composed<br />\nchiefly of Juniors and Seniors shall<br />\nbe suspended.<br />\n\"(2) That Juniors are to be given<br />\nsuch special reading as the instructor<br />\nmay consider best suited to their<br />\nneeds.<br />\n\"(3) That any instructor who does<br />\nnot consider it advisable to suspend<br />\nhis courses may hold classes during<br />\nthe reading period.\"<br />\nAlthough, according to the third<br />\nprovision, classes may be held during<br />\nthis year's reading period as in the<br />\npast, the inclusion of Juniors in the<br />\nplan will lessen the number of classes<br />\nheld, it is believed. Formerly, with<br />\nJuniors excluded from the readiiig<br />\nperiod, classes falling under t',e<br />\njurisdiction of the Social Science<br />\ngroup were largely made up of nonSeniors.<br />\n\"The plan is an experiment,\" said<br />\nDr Painter. \"The group hopes that<br />\nthe inclusion of Juniors will serve a<br />\ndouble purpose\u2014Juniors will be given<br />\na chance to read books outside the<br />\nregular reading for specific courses<br />\nand Seniors will be able to devote<br />\nmore time to work for which the<br />\nreading period was introduced if<br />\nfewer classes are held.\"<br /><br />\nHonor Commission<br />\nappoints new men<br />\nSix new appointments to the Honor commission were announced last<br />\nTuesday afternoon by Raymond<br />\nCluster, incumbent president.

However, no<br />\ndefinite schedule of meetings for<br />\nthis year has been announced by the<br />\ncommission as yet.<br />\nWith the coming of pre-holiday<br />\nexaminations, Cluster stated that he<br />\nwished to emphasize the great importance attached to the enforcement of the Honor system.<br />\n\"It is just as much a part of the<br />\nhonor system to report a violation<br />\nas it is to avoid personal violation\",<br />\nhe said. \"The system cannot possibly work unless all violations are<br />\nreported.\"<br /><br />\nWar and Peace<br />\nGreenfield leads<br />\nMC forum<br />\nDr Kent Roberts Greenfield, acting as chairman at the International<br />\nRelation club's symposium on world<br />\naffairs last Saturday, placed two<br />\ngeneral questions before the six men<br />\npresent at the speakers' table. Opening the discussion on \"A program<br />\nfor Peace after the Present War\",<br />\nhe asked \"What kind of peace do we<br />\nrequire as a nation?\" and \"To what<br />\nextent is such a peace possible?\"<br />\nAt the morning session, Which<br />\nlasted from 10:30 to 12:30, Dr W<br />\nStull Holt, professor of American<br />\nhistory; Dr A 0 Lovejoy, professor<br />\nemeritus of philosophy; and Dr Franz<br />\nMichael, of the Page school of international relations, discussed the<br />\nAmerican point of view towards a<br />\npeace and the general question of the<br />\nstruggle between liberty and authority in creating a state of international system for Europe.<br />\n\"Obviously we want peace\", said<br />\nDr Holt, who opened the discussion, \"and most public opinion would<br />\nlike to see peace with justice. Most<br />\nof all the present administration<br />\nwould like to see the world organized so that wars are kept at a minimum. There has been no clear indication of how America will pay the<br />\nprice for a peace it wants. But the<br />\nessential thing is to adopt some kind<br />\nof a program if we want peace.\"<br />\nQuestions from the other speakers<br />\nand from the floor followed Dr Holt's<br />\nintroductory remarks; the general<br />\npoint of the discussion centered<br />\naround the advisability of the United<br />\nStates' entering the war, and the<br />\nprobable effect of such an action on<br />\nthis country's bargaining power in<br />\nthe peace conference. Dr Holt contended that, \"if the dictators win,<br />\nwe will become more dictatorial. If<br />\nthe world continues on this basis,<br />\nwe will be involved in this war or<br />\nsome future one. We will overcome<br />\nthis trend if we act now, and at<br />\nthe same time, we will make unnecessary paying a higher price for<br />\nstaying out of war\".<br />\nDr Lovejoy provoked a discussion of economic determinism as a<br />\nfactor in creating crises in foreign<br />\naffairs.

The threat inherent in the active military participation of Russia in the West, defined by Britain as against the Western Coalition adds<br />\na menace to the cause of compromise and peace that<br />\nis incalculable at this moment.

Compared with University of Chicago students for instance, who probably never know what their charming but occasionally<br />\ndisconcerting Dr Hutchins will suggest next, students<br />\nat Hopkins have much to be thankful for.<br />\nAnd one of the things they ought to be especially<br />\nthankful for is the new reading period plan. This<br />\nplan doesn't have the air of a scheme conceived by<br />\nan educational wizard; somehow most schemes which<br />\nstartle at first become dead letters within a year or<br />\ntwo. It looks more as if this plan were a sincere<br />\neffort on the part of the Social Science group to do<br />\naway with a few difficulties which arose when reading<br />\nperiods were begun in the University about seven or<br />\neight years ago.<br />\nSeniors now have a better chance of being relieved from the pressure of making up work or from<br />\ngiving up part of the reading period to attend classes;<br /><br />\nReading<br />\nPeriod,<br />\nJr.<br /><br />\nwith both Juniors and Seniors included in the plan,<br />\nmore classes will have majorities of those who can<br />\ntake advantage of the obviously valuable reading<br />\nperiod.<br />\nTo Juniors in the Social Science group, the plan<br />\nis of even more value. From one point of view,<br />\nwhich is too often disregarded, the Junior year in<br />\ncollege is as important as, if not more important than,<br />\nthe Senior year. It is in the Junior year that a<br />\ngeneral synthesizing of knowledge must take place.<br />\nThe first two years of a college curriculum are devoted to survey courses, introduction to new lines of<br />\nthought, and a general reorientation of views along<br />\nmore mature lines than those presented in prep schools.<br />\nThe senior year is devoted to final work for a degree.<br />\nStanding in between, the Junior year presents an excellent opportunity for examination of what has gone<br />\nbefore and for work in anticipation of what is to<br />\ncome.<br />\nAll too often, Juniors come to realize that some<br />\none phase of study has been neglected, that this or<br />\nthat book should have been read, or that some special<br />\nwork ought to be done in preparation for the future.<br />\nEven if he realizes this, the Junior seldom has time<br />\nto do more than keep up with his regular reading.<br />\nA reading period for at least the Social Science<br />\nJuniors will come as a happy solution to many of<br />\nthese problems.<br />\nWe can't make out this<br />\nyear's crop of seniors. For<br />\nweeks they battled to have<br />\ntheir Hullabaloo assured;<br />\nthey were willing to promise<br />\nanything\u2014well, almost anything if they could but have<br />\npermanent record of their final year at Hopkins. The<br />\noffenses, to hear the senior speak, were that the yearbook staff was inefficient, the officers didn't- cooperate<br />\nwith one another, the Administration was interfering,<br />\netc, etc.<br />\nWell, they finally got their Hullabaloo, and sat<br />\ndown and rubbed their hands over the \"victory.\"<br />\nNow, now when the coast is clear, and the photographers and staff are busy, they avoid their appointments for pictures as if the soliciting agent was an<br />\ninsurance salesman.<br />\nThe associate editors as well as the other members of the staff who have arranged the myriad details<br />\nconnected with the senior pictures know all the nasty<br />\nthings one can say about \"inefficiency . .. no cooperation . . independability . . . etc.\" Those boys know<br />\nall the old cracks and have invented sixteen new ones.<br />\nAnd if the seniors don't get down to their appointments on time there will be another senior assembly\u2014<br />\nat which all the seniors will sit on the platform, and<br />\nthe Hullabaloo staff will heckle them from the audience.<br />\nAll we can say is, it's<br />\nabout time. And we do mean<br />\nthe Honor commission. Why<br />\nappointments haven't been<br />\nmade until the beginning of<br />\nDecember to a group which<br />\nis supposed to keep the Honor system constantly before students is more than we<br />\ncan fathom.<br />\nAdd to that the fact that \"no definite schedule of<br />\nmeetings . . has been announced by the commission<br />\nas yet\" and a pretty sorry picture emerges. And<br />\nthe same old propaganda comes out of the commission; that is, when it comes at all. \"It is just as<br />\nmuch a part of the honor system to report a violation<br />\nas it is to avoid personal violation\". Well, we know<br />\nthat, and have known it for a long time.<br />\nTime was when the Honor commission filled the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER with stories\u2014not because the paper was<br />\nbeing used for propaganda purposes, but because the<br />\ncommission was news. Now it gets about as much<br />\nspace as the League of Nations in the daily press.<br />\nShort gasps, but nothing more, and those infrequent.<br />\nIt's a far cry from the commission as first founded<br />\nyear before last to today's commission. That first<br />\ngroup may have been enthusiastic because it was new,<br />\nbut it at least did something. It introduced the slip<br />\nsystem, and began to build up an attitude quite different<br />\nfrom that held by the sub-Student council Engineering Honor commission. That bunch of Honor system<br />\ncossacks was formed to play an only slightly minor<br />\nrole to the Student council's czar. It's job was to<br />\nferret out offenders and run them down.<br />\nThe AB and Business Honor commission brought a<br />\nnew and, we feel, a better attitude into play in enforcing the Honor system. No trials were held. The<br />\nnew commission was strictly an educational body.<br />\nAnd it worked.<br />\nBut it can't be kept going unless there is constant<br />\nwork. Appointments should -have been made at the<br />\nbeginning of the year; meetings should be held every<br />\nweek; and, above all, the Honor system should be<br />\nkept before the whole school all year long.<br />\nWe don't know whose fault it is, but we suspect the<br />\nHonor commission. Last year, a commission flourished even with part of the Student council in favor of<br />\ndoing away with. This year, the Student council is<br />\nmore than ready to support the commission, but there's<br />\nnothing to support. No plans, no publicity.<br />\nIt looks as if the commission needs more going<br />\nover than just appointing new members.<br /><br />\nRevolution<br />\nand<br />\nSabotage<br /><br />\nThe Commission<br />\nEmerges<br />\nat last<br /><br />\nPotpourri<br />\n(number Seven)<br /><br />\nBy Ned Hackett<br />\nIn<br /><br />\nand out of his Corner, J B in-<br /><br />\nsists upon realism.
