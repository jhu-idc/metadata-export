Fink said,<br />\n\"Lenardo told me that unless I<br />\nstart showing concern for the<br />\nstudent body, he will take the<br />\n400-500 votes over which he<br />\nholds sway and see that they will<br />\nnot vote for me for Young<br />\nTrustee in the upcoming<br />\nelection.\" \"He said he had sway<br />\nover 400-500 votes and that I<br />\nshould think about it,\" Fink<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nFink and at least three other<br />\nCouncil members are running for<br />\nthe position of Young Trustee.<br />\nLenardo denied that he<br />\nthreatened Fink in such a<br />\nmanner, stating,\"I spoke to Alan<br />\n<br />\na week ago because he had<br />\nslandered me over the ballot box<br />\nissue and I asked him then how<br />\nin good conscience he could run<br />\nfor Young Trustee. This<br />\nconstituted to him a threat.\"<br />\nLenard() said he does not<br />\napprove of the removal of the<br />\nballot boxes and would have<br />\nfavored, instead, further<br />\nencouragements for<br />\nupperclassmen to vote.<br />\nThe other Trustee candidates<br />\ndenied that they had been<br />\napproached by Lenardo, but<br />\naccording to certain Council<br />\nmembers the denials were \"only<br />\nofficial\" and made out of a<br />\n\"sense of obligation.\"<br />\n<br />\nMike Lenardo<br />\nThis latest political<br />\nconfrontation within the Council<br />\nis symptomatic of the general<br />\nmalaise that has beset the SC.<br />\nThe ballot box issue was \"so<br />\npolitically motivated on both<br />\nsides,\" stated Leah Seidenfeld,<br />\njunior class rep. \"I didn't vote.<br />\nI'm so disenchanted with the<br />\nstudent council.\"<br />\nSophomore class<br />\nrepresentative Jill Leukhardt also<br />\nabstained on the motionto<br />\nreconsider the ballot box shift.<br />\n\"Michael had made it plain that<br />\n<br />\nhe wanted us to go along with<br />\nhim.\" The political infighting has<br />\n\"gotten to the point where it's<br />\nridiculous\" Leukhardt said.<br />\nNoting that neither students nor<br />\nadministrators have confidence in<br />\nLenardo, Leukhardt observed \"I<br />\nthink it's been a bad year for the<br />\nSC. Let me qualify that. We did a<br />\nlot of things that were<br />\nworthwhile, but it's been a<br />\nstruggle.\"<br />\n\"Mike refuses to use<br />\nparlimentary procedure, unless<br />\nit's in his interest,\" she<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nHowever, Louise Firestone,<br />\nsoph rep, stated \"It's not just<br />\nMike.

He went<br />\non to say that there are only two<br />\nways to stabilize the complex<br />\nsociety of today. \"One is<br />\ndespotism and the other<br />\nconsensus.\"<br />\nThe disruption occurred<br />\nwhen Provost Harry Woolf<br />\ncompleted reading the citation<br />\n<br />\naccompanying the honorary<br />\nDoctorate of Laws awarded the<br />\nPrincess.

With an<br />\nundergraduate student body of<br />\n16,000 and a \"less that<br />\nexcellent\" reputation for<br />\npre-medical education, the source<br />\nsaid it is unlikely that the actual<br />\nfigure is that high. Spokesmen<br />\nfor the joint student committee<br />\nalso expressed some doubt over<br />\nthe validity of this particular<br />\nstatistic.,<br />\nOne University official went<br />\nso far as to call the data basis<br />\nused in the report \"flimsy\" and<br />\nadded that the report in general<br />\nwas indicative of a \"poor\" job by<br />\nAED and the SC.<br />\nThe report's preparers did<br />\nsay they were \"rushed\" in their<br />\nefforts to prepare a<br />\ncomprehensive report in time to<br />\nhave a potential effect on next<br />\nyear's pre -medical<br />\nrecommendations procedure.<br />\nAdmitting that the report<br />\n<br />\nsee PRE\u2014MED, page 9<br />\n<br />\n\fCAMPUS NOTES_<br />\n<br />\npage 2/newsietter/february 24, 1976<br />\n<br />\nmeetings<br />\n<br />\nacademe<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins Fred Harris for<br />\nPresident Committee will hold its<br />\nnext regular meeting on Wed., Feb.<br />\n25 at 4 p.m. in Conference Room A.<br />\nInterested persons who cannot attend<br />\nshould call Jim McBride at 403 or<br />\n624 fur further information.<br />\nThe Goucher-Hopkins Russian Club<br />\nwill hold its next meeting on Wed.,<br />\nFeb. 25 at 5:30 p.m. in the Hueb.eck<br />\n.

His topic was<br />\n\"Science and the Well-Being of<br />\nPeople,\" a subject with which he<br />\nis extremely involved, having<br />\nwon a second Nobel prize, the<br />\nPeace award, in 1962.<br />\nIn introducing his theme,<br />\nPauling commented upon his<br />\nPersonal preference for science<br />\nover other fields of occupation.<br />\nNoting the personal satisfaction<br />\nof discoveries in this area, he<br />\nrelated the story of a fellow<br />\nscientist, who, returning home at<br />\nthree o'clock in the morning<br />\nfrom his laboratory, was<br />\noverjoyed upon realizing that \"he<br />\nWas the only person in the world<br />\nWho knew that the nucleus of<br />\nsodium -23 has a spin of<br />\nthree-halves.\"<br />\nPauling then addressed<br />\nhimself to the relation between<br />\nmonetary income and well-being.<br />\nAccording to quoted figures, 20%<br />\nof the entire world's income is<br />\nSplit equally between two<br />\ngroups\u2014the very rich (top .1%)<br />\nand the poor (bottom 67%).Using<br />\nthese statistics as an argument for<br />\nred istribution of income, he<br />\nnoted that by transferring<br />\none-half of the affluent group<br />\nincome to one-half of indigent<br />\ngroup would result in a positive<br />\nnet gain of 332 \"units of<br />\nsuffering,\" (which he termed<br />\n\"suffs\") therefore increasing the<br />\nhappiness of the population as a<br />\nWhole.<br />\nConsidering the problem of<br />\nour responsibility to future<br />\n<br />\nWatson<br />\n<br />\nspeak<br />\n<br />\ngenerations, Pauling mostly<br />\ndiscussed the requirements of<br />\nenergy supplies.

Their quality is<br />\nsatisfactory,and their prices are<br />\nthe best.\"<br />\nAnother point weighing in<br />\nSaga's favor, said Eliasoph, is the<br />\nwillingness of Saga executives to<br />\nlisten to student complaints and<br />\nrequests. \"The cordial,<br />\ncooperative staff has done its<br />\nbest to relieve complaints,\" he<br />\nstated.<br />\nOther companies which have<br />\nsubmitted bids include<br />\nARA/Slater, Ogden, Macke, and<br />\nServ-a-mation.

Editor-in-Chief of<br />\nTime, Inc.<br />\nThe purpose of the<br />\nsymposium, in Muller's words,<br />\n\"was to see where the university<br />\nis going to in the next hundred<br />\nyears,\" and to try \"to reassess<br />\nthis institution\" in the situation<br />\nof the present day. \"We will<br />\ndiscuss what the people have the<br />\nright to expect from the<br />\nAmerican university . . . what<br />\nought or what ought not to<br />\nhappen.\"<br />\nFather Hesburgh of Notre<br />\nDame, described by Muller as<br />\n\"the conscience of us all<br />\n[university presidents]\" noted<br />\nthe radical change of<br />\nexpectations which had occurred<br />\nin the last decade with regard to<br />\nthe university. \"Today's society<br />\nexpects less of us in solving all<br />\nour problems.\"<br />\nThe \"high optimism\" of the<br />\nearly sixties was succeeded by<br />\n\"dismay and alarm\" and the<br />\n\"unprecedented barbarism\" of<br />\nthe campus upheavals during the<br />\ntime of the Vietnam War. \"The<br />\njungle had suddenly invaded the<br />\ngroves of academe.\" Now the<br />\ncampuses have quieted down and<br />\nthe university \"faces the future<br />\nwith more modesty\" when<br />\naiming for its civilized goals.<br />\nDavid Rogers followed<br />\nHesburgh's tone of cautious<br />\noptimism with a more pessimistic<br />\nlook at the university. The<br />\nAmerican universities of today<br />\nare \"quite ill,\" they are \"too big,<br />\ntoo detached\" and \"irrelevant\"<br />\nto the needs ot today's society.<br />\nRogers believes that<br />\nuniversities \"must demonstrate<br />\nthey are worth what they cost.\"<br />\nRogers frequently cited his<br />\nexperience as a medical school<br />\nad m in 1st rator, explaining the<br />\nnecessity of reconciling the<br />\nintrinsic idealism of education<br />\nwith the greater problems of<br />\nsociety.<br />\nMarcus Raskin painted an<br />\neven bleaker portrait of the<br />\nuniversity than Rogers. Muller<br />\nwell described him as a \"radical<br />\nin the best sense of the term.\"<br />\nThe university, he charged, had<br />\n\"failed to relate knowledge to<br />\nvirtue,\" and this failure had<br />\ncaused it to degenerate into just<br />\nanother segment of \"the<br />\nestablished order.\"<br />\n\"Knowledge and education<br />\nhave traditionally been called the<br />\nliberating instruments . . . the<br />\nassumption being more<br />\nknowledge and education lead to<br />\n<br />\nabetter life.\"<br />\n\u2022 He theorized that the<br />\nuniversity had become the<br />\n\"humanistic substitute for<br />\nreligion,\" with the decline of<br />\nmoral and social values. Indicting<br />\nthe natural and social sciences for<br />\nvalue-free research, he criticized<br />\nthose disciplines for merely<br />\n\"piling one piece of knowledge<br />\non top of another . . . without<br />\neven questioning the relationship<br />\nbetween the ongoing social<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\n\"The universities should.\"<br />\nRaskin continued, \"but don't<br />\nopen themselves to different<br />\nsorts of ideas.\" Currently, \"the<br />\nuniversity is the purveyor of<br />\nongoing knowledge, of social<br />\nvalues of the dominant class<br />\nstructure, but fails as a liberating<br />\nifistrument.\"<br />\n\"No reforms are possible as<br />\nlong as the university has a<br />\nmonopoly on entrance<br />\nrequirements and a monopoly on<br />\ncertification.\" He advocated the<br />\nidea that the university should<br />\nadmit the \"worst\" students<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nfuture of University<br />\n<br />\nwhich its standards usually<br />\nbarred. Raskin also echoed a<br />\ncriticism made some thirty years<br />\nago by Simone Weil, who<br />\nattacked modern society for<br />\nconsidering manual and<br />\nintellectual work as separate<br />\nen tities.<br />\nRaskin ended his critique<br />\nwith some prescriptions for<br />\nreform. \"Universities,\" he said.<br />\n\"have got to take an agnostic<br />\nview of the state if they are to<br />\nsurvive.

Unlike many of<br />\nhis<br />\nhis colleagues, he can and<br />\ndoes demonstrate the value of his<br />\ncraft. He is the author of several<br />\nhighly respected studies on<br />\nimperialism, race relations, and<br />\nslavery. But he is also the editor<br />\nof a delightful anthology, The<br />\nHistorian as Detective, which he<br />\ncompiled \"to give me some<br />\nmodest fun.\" In it, Winks drew<br />\nclose parallels between the work<br />\nof historians and the attempts of<br />\nfictional investigators such as<br />\nHercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes,<br />\nand Sam Spade to decide on<br />\nquestions of evidence. Winks was<br />\nable to. evoke the humor and<br />\nexcitement of research through<br />\nhis own fascinating experiences.<br />\nWinks asserted that unlike<br />\ntheir colleagues in the social and<br />\nbehavioral sciences, historians<br />\n\"enjoy ambiguity and<br />\nambivalence.\" Because of this,<br />\nthey are often dismissed as<br />\nindecisive by other disciplines.<br />\nThe historian\u2014is one who<br />\n\"prefers to open doors rather<br />\nthan close them.\" He desires not<br />\nto jedge, but to understand. His<br />\nvirtues are \"tolerance and<br />\ntentativeness.\"<br />\nWinks calls the historian,<br />\n\"The Grand Prince of Options.\"<br />\nHe does not want to make<br />\ndecision. In a sense, he \"cops<br />\nout.\" The historian can often<br />\nmake \"extremely unpopular and<br />\nradical decisions precisely<br />\nbecause no one is listening.\"<br />\nQuite seriously, however, the<br />\nhistorian does have a vital role to<br />\nplay. His task is to discover the<br />\nhidden meanings, the<br />\nunarticulated thoughts, and the<br />\nfeelings of huinan beings in the<br />\npast.

John Brademas<br />\nprimarily argued that politicians<br />\nwere not responsible for the<br />\npresent dilemma of the<br />\nuniversity. The educators were to<br />\nblame for the crisis, he claimed,<br />\nbecause they failed to provide<br />\nthe governrnent with sufficient<br />\ninformation to make a decision.<br />\nBrademas quoted the late<br />\nLyndon Johnson to the effect<br />\nthat \"The problem is not<br />\nwhether I can do the right thing,<br />\nbut what the right thing is to<br />\ndo.\"<br />\nThe opening statements were<br />\nconcluded by Hedley Donovan,<br />\n<br />\nwho attempted to relieve the<br />\n\"atmosphere of unrelieved<br />\ngloom,\" by reminiscing about the<br />\nchanges which have occurred<br />\nsince his days at the University of<br />\nMinnesota.<br />\nA short discussion ensured<br />\nbetween the participants, with<br />\nMuller challenging some of<br />\nRaskin's points. Muller<br />\nquestioned the universities<br />\nfunction to determine ethics or<br />\nmorals. He did agree that<br />\nprecious little learning was going<br />\non, and he repeated \u2022 a quip he<br />\nhad made previously to the effect<br />\nthat students should be awarded<br />\ntheir degrees at the time of<br />\nmatriculation so that they could<br />\nat least learn something.<br />\n<br />\na relevant historian<br />\n<br />\nhistorian to be a backwardlooking judge who alternately<br />\ndistributes blame and praise to<br />\nthe respective fools and wise men<br />\nof the past.

We must<br />\nunderstand the past in order, to<br />\nsurvive in the present.<br />\n<br />\nWinks gave a concrete<br />\nexample of this idea from his<br />\nown services in the State<br />\nDepartment., when Arab<br />\nterrorists held hostages from four<br />\nnations at London's Heathrow<br />\nAirport. It was feared that Great<br />\nBritain would withdraw from a<br />\nuniform st and against these<br />\nterrorists. Winks was chosen to<br />\ndraft the statement that would<br />\npersuade the government. to<br />\nstand firm because he<br />\n\"understood their language.\"<br />\nAnd. \"they were right to think<br />\nthat, because I did understand<br />\n<br />\ntheir language.\"<br />\nAs Winks concluded.<br />\nhistorians are the \"allies of<br />\neverybody.\" They're \"constantly<br />\nunpacking their presuppositions<br />\nand putting their cards on the<br />\ntable.\"<br />\nThe historian's role is vital.<br />\nsays Winks, because he is the<br />\nonly social scientist trying to<br />\nunderstand why people think, or<br />\nact the way they do.

The study,<br />\nknown as the \"Coleman Report,\"<br />\npresented massive statistical<br />\nevidence supporting the theory<br />\nthat the achievement of minority<br />\nstudents increases in an<br />\nenvironment of upper middle<br />\nclass students. The report was<br />\nwidely cited as justification for<br />\nin forced integration and busing<br />\nthroughout the latter half of the<br />\nsix ties.<br />\nThe problem of integration<br />\nhas become far more complicated<br />\nthan originally anticipated. White<br />\nand black resistence has taken an<br />\norganized form as court battles<br />\n<br />\nrage on and the basing issue still<br />\ncontinues to evoke controversy.<br />\nDisillusionment has resulted, and<br />\nthe fervor so prevalent in the<br />\nsixties has faded. Many strongly<br />\nquestion the validity of the<br />\nliberal doctrines advocating<br />\nintegration, and many blame the<br />\nacademic community for its<br />\nfailu re,<br />\n, Switch<br />\nUpon reevaluating his<br />\nposition in light of these new<br />\ndevelopments, Coleman now<br />\nmaintains that school<br />\ndesegragation, especially in the<br />\nform of forced busing, is a major<br />\ncause of \"white flight.\" Thus<br />\nforced integration ultimately<br />\nworks against the interest of the<br />\ndisadvantaged minorities.<br />\nBecause of this, Coleman has<br />\neased his busing stand and now<br />\nadvocates voluntary cross-district<br />\nbusing,<br />\nColeman's switch from his<br />\nstrong stand for busing to a<br />\nmoderate stand has been taken<br />\nby many as a stab in the back.

He worked his<br />\nway through Howard University<br />\ndoing odd jobs and graduated in<br />\n1886 with a B.A. Five years later,<br />\nMiller earned an M.A. in<br />\nmathematics from Johns<br />\nHopkins.

In these<br />\nbooks, Miller expressed anger<br />\n<br />\nnot only towards whites for their<br />\ninjustice against blacks, but<br />\ntowards his own people \u2022 for what<br />\nlie considered their lethargic<br />\nresponse to racial discrimination.<br />\nIn Everlasting Stain, Miller<br />\nemphasizes the necessity of Black<br />\npeople accepting responsibilities:<br />\n\"The Negro must contribute his<br />\nbest to the general welfare and<br />\nderive his just share form it.

In a rebuttal<br />\nof Thomas Dixon's novel<br />\nattacking Blacks, Leopard Spots,<br />\nMiller wrote: \"You are a white<br />\n\u2022 man born in the midst of the<br />\nCivil War: I am a Negro born<br />\nduring the same stirring epoch.<br />\nYou are born with a silver spoon<br />\nin your mouth: I was born with<br />\nan iron hoe in my hand.\" His<br />\ncommand of the language reveals<br />\na delightful humor in addition to<br />\nthe more dignified style of his<br />\npolitical writings: \"This<br />\nffusion\" he said of a book<br />\nwhich he loaded down with large<br />\nwords, \"is but the garrulity of<br />\nThe septugenerian who should be<br />\nrelegated to the limbo of<br />\nsilence.\"<br />\nMiller died in 1939, after<br />\n.spending his later years living<br />\nwith his wife Annie May Butler<br />\nMiller near the Howard<br />\nUniversity campus.

Overall, the cagers<br />\nwent 1-3 for the week, but<br />\nclinched a playoff berth for the<br />\nchance to go to the NCAA<br />\nDivision III championship<br />\ntournament.<br />\nFollowing a \"close, but no<br />\ncigar\" effort against the tough<br />\nPioneers of Widener College last<br />\nSaturday, the Hopkins hoopsters<br />\ntravelled to Lancaster, Pa. on<br />\nMonday, :where they received<br />\nanother setback; this time at the<br />\nhands of Franklin and Marshall.<br />\nWednesday night found the<br />\nJays at home trying to clinch a<br />\nplayoff spot against Haverford<br />\nCollege- a task at which they<br />\nwere successful. And: finally,<br />\nfollowing these three difficult<br />\ngames, and suffering from the<br />\nflu, a trip on Saturday to<br />\nWashington College resulted in<br />\nanother loss.<br />\nFinest<br />\nThe Widener game.<br />\ncompeting with fraternity rush<br />\nfor attention, was played before<br />\na less than capacity crowd, for<br />\nfirst place in the MAC-southeastern conference. Coach<br />\nRupert called it \"the finest<br />\nbasketball game that I have ever<br />\nseen a Hopkins team play.\"<br />\nSparked by Brian Gapsis,<br />\ncoming off the bench, and Dean<br />\nUhler, in his first Hopkins start,<br />\nthe Blue Jays battled from an<br />\n11-point half-time deficit to knot<br />\nthe game at 59 at the end of<br />\nregulation time, on a jump shot<br />\nby Andy Scheinfeld.<br />\nThe second half was<br />\ndominated by Hopkins as the<br />\nJays compiled impressive<br />\nrebounding statistics, (JHU-39,<br />\nWidener-35), against a larger,<br />\nmore physical, team, that had<br />\nbeaten them by 32 points earlier<br />\nin the season.<br />\nThe overtime .period began<br />\nwith Hopkins taking the tip-off<br />\nand holding the ball for two and<br />\none-half minutes, at which point<br />\nAndy Scheinfeld took a fifteen<br />\nfoot jumper that dropped in but<br />\nspun out. Widener grabbed the<br />\nrebound and held on to the,ball<br />\nuntil the final seconds of the<br />\novertime period, when they<br />\nscored to ice the game,61-59.<br />\nLeaders .<br />\nLeaders for the Jays were<br />\nGapsis and Uhler with 17 and 14<br />\npoints respectively, and Drew<br />\nFender who hauled in 13<br />\nrebounds.<br />\nAgainst Franklin and<br />\nMarshall the following Monday<br />\nevening, Rupert's charges may<br />\nhave experienced a mild letdown<br />\nas they succumbed<br />\n8-63.<br />\nLeading the Jays on offense were<br />\nAndy Scheinfeld who scored 17<br />\npoints, Dean Uhler with 16<br />\npoints, and Drew Fender with 13<br />\npoints. Uhler also gathered in 13<br />\ncaroms as Paul Paytas<br />\ncontributed eight assists.<br />\nAlthough the b-ballers lost to<br />\nF & M this result may have some<br />\npositive benefits. Hopkins is<br />\nslated to play the Diplomats in<br />\nt he first round of the MAC<br />\nplayoff's.

The score is<br />\nirrelevant when one considers the<br />\nfact that the result was<br />\ndetermined by the last event<br />\nwhich the Terps won by only .08<br />\nseconds!<br />\nThe meet got off to a fine<br />\nstart as the Terrapins won the<br />\n400-yard medley relay with a<br />\ntime of 3:42.7. This set the stage<br />\nfor a showdown in the 1000-yard<br />\nfreestyle between Hopkins' Mike<br />\nBay and Maryland's Sid Burkot.<br />\nThe two swimmers went<br />\nstroke for stroke for all 40<br />\nlengths with Bay holding a slight<br />\nedge until Burkot came on strong<br />\nand touched just before the<br />\nfreshman Jay by .12 seconds. It<br />\nseemed as though the meet could<br />\nonly go on to be anti-climactic<br />\nafter such an event but this was<br />\nnot the case.<br />\nThe 200-yard freestyle<br />\nfollowed and this saw Eric<br />\nHorning cut four seconds off of<br />\nhis career best time to take a<br />\nsecond place. This would be the<br />\nbest meet of Horning's career as<br />\nhe later finished second in the<br />\n500-yard freestyle with an<br />\noutstanding time of 5:02.7 which<br />\nwas his career best by nearly nine<br />\nseconds.<br />\nMarc Tohis had little trouble<br />\nwith his opponents as he won the<br />\none-meter diving competition<br />\nwith Mike DiCio finishing third.<br />\nAnother thrilling event<br />\nfollowed in the 200-yard<br />\nbutter fly as freshman Frank<br />\nMcGovern passed the Terp leader<br />\non the last lap to win with a<br />\nnational Division III qualifying<br />\ntime of 2:01.1.<br />\nRoy Beveridge and captain<br />\nJim Spiering finished second and<br />\nthird in the 100-yard freestyle as<br />\nMike Bay went on to .win the<br />\n200-yard backstroke. It was in<br />\nthis event that junior John<br />\nDierkes swam his best time of the<br />\nyear to finish second.<br />\nMaryland's captain Bob<br />\nHassett, considered by many to<br />\nbe one of the finest<br />\nbreaststrokers in the country. ran<br />\naway with the 200-yarder as he<br />\nset a new pool record with a time<br />\n<br />\nof 2:14.07, breaking the old<br />\nmark by more than two seconds.<br />\nHopkins now held a one<br />\npoint lead going into the<br />\nthree-meter diving competition,<br />\nwhere the hosts were considered<br />\nto hold a slight edge. If the Jay<br />\ndivers could take first and<br />\nsecond, the meet would be<br />\nclinched.<br />\nThis was not to be the case<br />\nhowever, as Maryland finished<br />\nfirst and second with the top<br />\nfour spots separated by merely<br />\nfive points.<br />\nThe meet would now go<br />\ndown to the 400-yard freestyle<br />\nrelay where the Terrapins held a<br />\nconsiderable edge. Hopkins still<br />\nhad a mathematical chance of<br />\nwinning the meet if it could take<br />\nthe relay. They trailed 56-50, but<br />\nthe relay was worth seven points.<br />\nWhat followed was the most<br />\nsuspenseful and sensational finale<br />\nin many years.<br />\nJim Spiering, Mike Bay, and<br />\nFrank Jones gave the Blue Jays<br />\nan unexpected slight lead going<br />\nto the last 100 yards. Anchorman<br />\nRoy Beveridge swam a great leg<br />\nbut was only caught by the<br />\nMaryland swimmer who swam<br />\nthe best 100 yards ever at<br />\nHopkins at 47.8. The final<br />\ndecision had to be made by, a<br />\ncomputer brought in for the<br />\nmeet which saw the Terrapins<br />\nwin the relay by .08 seconds. The<br />\nBlue Jay time was more than<br />\nfour seconds better than their<br />\nprevious best of the year. The<br />\nfour swimmers all swam the best<br />\n100 yard times of their careers as<br />\nthe team fell just so short of a<br />\nmajor upset.<br />\nCoach Frank Comfort was<br />\nunderstandably disappointed by<br />\nthe loss but was thrilled by the<br />\nfine performances turned in by<br />\nall. \"We were hoping at best to<br />\nget the meet down to the relay<br />\nwhere they, of course, were<br />\nconsiderable favorites. We only<br />\nfinished first in 4 of 13 events<br />\nbut our fine depth allowed us to<br />\nachieve our goal. I was elated by<br />\nthe performances of the<br />\nswimmers in the relay and<br />\nconsidered this to be the most<br />\nspectacular meet to be held in<br />\nthis area for a long time.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays now own a 6-6<br />\nrecord with most of their losses<br />\n<br />\ncoming against NCAA Division 1<br />\nteams. Their next meet will be<br />\nheld at Dickinson College today<br />\nas the team prepares for the 29th<br />\nAnnual MAC Championships to<br />\nbe held at Homewood pool this<br />\nFriday, Saturday, and.Sunday.<br />\nMeanwhile in a meet which<br />\nperhaps better exhibits the<br />\noverall strength of the Hopkins<br />\nswimming programs as it has<br />\nbeen built by Coach Frank<br />\nComfort than any other, the<br />\nHopkins \"B\" team won the first<br />\nTri-State Championship swim<br />\nmeet against the varsity swim<br />\nteams of major universities like<br />\nTowson State, Loyola, Morgan<br />\nState, Coppin State and York<br />\nCollege among others, at Towson<br />\nState.<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jays out-distanced<br />\nsecond place Towson 139-118<br />\nthus avenging an earlier season<br />\ndefeat administered them by the<br />\nTigers.<br />\nBill Sick highlighted the<br />\nHomewood performances by<br />\ntaking firsts in both the 100 and<br />\n200 breast, turning in the best<br />\n100 time of any Comforteer ever<br />\nunshaved. Tim Culiinan was a<br />\nfinalist and second place finisher<br />\nin both of the above mentioned<br />\nevents while Ty Lanahan<br />\ncaptured the 200 free.<br />\nHopkins dominated the<br />\ndiving with Dave Scotti and Jay<br />\nDarrell finishing 1-2 in the 3<br />\nmeter.

Zdanis.<br />\nLinus C. Pauling<br />\nThe program was opened<br />\nFriday by Dr. Pauling, probably<br />\nbest known for describing the<br />\nalpha-helix of polypeptide<br />\nsecondary structure, for which he<br />\nreceived the Nobel prize in<br />\nChemistry in 1954. His topic was<br />\n\"Science and the Well-Being of<br />\nPeople,\" a subject with which he<br />\nis extremely involved, having<br />\nwon a second Nobel prize, the<br />\nPeace award, in 1962.<br />\nIn introducing his theme,<br />\nPauling commented upon his<br />\nPersonal preference for science<br />\nover other fields of occupation.<br />\nNoting the personal satisfaction<br />\nof discoveries in this area, he<br />\nrelated the story of a fellow<br />\nscientist, who, returning home at<br />\nthree o'clock in the morning<br />\nfrom his laboratory, was<br />\noverjoyed upon realizing that \"he<br />\nWas the only person in the world<br />\nWho knew that the nucleus of<br />\nsodium -23 has a spin of<br />\nthree-halves.\"<br />\nPauling then addressed<br />\nhimself to the relation between<br />\nmonetary income and well-being.<br />\nAccording to quoted figures, 20%<br />\nof the entire world's income is<br />\nSplit equally between two<br />\ngroups\u2014the very rich (top .1%)<br />\nand the poor (bottom 67%).Using<br />\nthese statistics as an argument for<br />\nred istribution of income, he<br />\nnoted that by transferring<br />\none-half of the affluent group<br />\nincome to one-half of indigent<br />\ngroup would result in a positive<br />\nnet gain of 332 \"units of<br />\nsuffering,\" (which he termed<br />\n\"suffs\") therefore increasing the<br />\nhappiness of the population as a<br />\nWhole.<br />\nConsidering the problem of<br />\nour responsibility to future<br /><br />\nWatson<br /><br />\nspeak<br /><br />\ngenerations, Pauling mostly<br />\ndiscussed the requirements of<br />\nenergy supplies.

Watson is also well known<br />\nfor his popular book describing<br />\nthe background of that<br />\ndiscovery, The Double Helbc.<br />\nWatson's topic for discussion<br />\nwas \"The Impact of Molecular<br />\nBiology on Cancer Research,\"<br />\nespecially the relation of changes<br />\nin the structure of DNA to<br />\ncancer formation.<br />\nWatson discussed different<br />\ninitiators of cancer, such as the<br />\nclass of chemical carcinogens<br />\nwhich induce malignancy<br />\nthrough chemical means.<br />\nAfter briefly touching upon<br />\nradiation-induced cancer, Watson<br />\nentered upon an elaborate<br />\ndiscussion of the area most.<br />\nstrongly relating to his field, that<br />\nof viral-initiated cancers. With<br />\nnumerous slide illustrations, he<br />\ndetailed the process through<br />\nwhich host DNA is changed<br /><br />\nLinus Pauling<br />\nfission, which he considers to be<br />\ntoo dangerous to be useful.<br />\nOn the problem of<br />\noverpopulation, Pau ling<br />\nconcluded that the Malthusian<br />\n\"leveling-off\" of population by<br />\nlimiting factors for survival<br />\n(food, space) would undoubtedly<br />\nlead to greatly increased misery<br />\nfor the greater part of mankind if<br />\na self-regulatory method is not<br />\nimplemented before this level is<br />\nreached.

He is the author of several<br />\nhighly respected studies on<br />\nimperialism, race relations, and<br />\nslavery. But he is also the editor<br />\nof a delightful anthology, The<br />\nHistorian as Detective, which he<br />\ncompiled \"to give me some<br />\nmodest fun.\" In it, Winks drew<br />\nclose parallels between the work<br />\nof historians and the attempts of<br />\nfictional investigators such as<br />\nHercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes,<br />\nand Sam Spade to decide on<br />\nquestions of evidence. Winks was<br />\nable to. evoke the humor and<br />\nexcitement of research through<br />\nhis own fascinating experiences.<br />\nWinks asserted that unlike<br />\ntheir colleagues in the social and<br />\nbehavioral sciences, historians<br />\n\"enjoy ambiguity and<br />\nambivalence.\" Because of this,<br />\nthey are often dismissed as<br />\nindecisive by other disciplines.<br />\nThe historian\u2014is one who<br />\n\"prefers to open doors rather<br />\nthan close them.\" He desires not<br />\nto jedge, but to understand. His<br />\nvirtues are \"tolerance and<br />\ntentativeness.\"<br />\nWinks calls the historian,<br />\n\"The Grand Prince of Options.\"<br />\nHe does not want to make<br />\ndecision. In a sense, he \"cops<br />\nout.\" The historian can often<br />\nmake \"extremely unpopular and<br />\nradical decisions precisely<br />\nbecause no one is listening.\"<br />\nQuite seriously, however, the<br />\nhistorian does have a vital role to<br />\nplay.

Muller<br />\nquestioned the universities<br />\nfunction to determine ethics or<br />\nmorals. He did agree that<br />\nprecious little learning was going<br />\non, and he repeated \u2022 a quip he<br />\nhad made previously to the effect<br />\nthat students should be awarded<br />\ntheir degrees at the time of<br />\nmatriculation so that they could<br />\nat least learn something.<br /><br />\na relevant historian<br /><br />\nhistorian to be a backwardlooking judge who alternately<br />\ndistributes blame and praise to<br />\nthe respective fools and wise men<br />\nof the past.

We must<br />\nunderstand the past in order, to<br />\nsurvive in the present.<br /><br />\nWinks gave a concrete<br />\nexample of this idea from his<br />\nown services in the State<br />\nDepartment., when Arab<br />\nterrorists held hostages from four<br />\nnations at London's Heathrow<br />\nAirport. It was feared that Great<br />\nBritain would withdraw from a<br />\nuniform st and against these<br />\nterrorists.

Unless<br />\nthis crisis is resolved, any attempts for fiscal stability arc<br />\nirrelevant. The problem is \"a crisis of purpose.\"<br />\nAre we a school for skills, or a university? President<br />\nMuller has expressed his personal opinion on numerous<br />\noccasions: \"Higher education now may not be producing<br />\npeople who arc really civilized; it is producing people who are<br />\nvery able in their specialties . . . you cannot take it for<br />\ngranted that people with university degrees can read or write<br />\nt heir own language well, that they have a thorough<br />\nknowledge of history, that they. are well-grounded in basic<br />\nmathematics. or that they have a basic knowledge of a second<br />\nlanguage<br />\n\"<br />\n\"I am going to worry about the extent to which this is<br />\nthe case at Hopkins and what we can do about it.''<br />\nThis issue is paramount to survival.

As a<br />\nresult, the feeling became clear in<br />\nproject_meetings that the<br />\ninstitutions being contacted were<br />\nnot really the kind of prospects<br />\nneeded. Whether the suspicions<br />\nwere true or false, the student<br />\ncommittee took the wrong<br />\napproach to countering them.<br />\nThe enthusiasm in sending letters<br />\nto these corporations and<br />\nfoundations became quite low,<br />\nand emphasis was placed on<br />\ngoing outside the structure of the<br />\nDevelopment Office. Schemes<br />\ndiscussed included various<br />\npublicity techniques and an idea<br />\nfor getting a prominent<br />\nBaltimore businessman as a<br />\nsponsor to \"get the word<br />\naround\" in the proper circles,<br />\nthat the Tuition Relief Program<br />\nshould be contributed to. The<br />\nbest tactic here would have been<br />\nto send 100 letters per week<br />\nrather than 10.

His name is Kelly Miller.<br />\nMilitant author on civil rights and<br />\na dynamic president of Howard<br />\nUniversity, Kelly Miller was also<br />\nthe first black to earn a degree<br />\nfrom Hopkins.<br />\nBorn to sharecropper parents<br />\nin South Carolina, Miller grew up<br />\nin a family of ten. He worked his<br />\nway through Howard University<br />\ndoing odd jobs and graduated in<br />\n1886 with a B.A. Five years later,<br />\nMiller earned an M.A. in<br />\nmathematics from Johns<br />\nHopkins. After an additional year<br />\nteaching in the Washington<br />\nPublic Schools, he returned to<br />\nHoward University where he was<br />\nto spend the rest of his life<br />\nfighting for racial and academic<br />\nfreedom\u2014first as professor of<br />\nmathematics and sociology, then<br />\nas Dean of the College of Arts<br />\nand finally as Howard's first<br />\nBlack president.<br />\nAnger<br />\nThe volumes for which Kelly<br />\nMiller is best known include Race<br />\nAdjustment (1908), Out of the<br />\nHouse of Bondage (1914) and<br />\nEverlasting Stain (1924). In these<br />\nbooks, Miller expressed anger<br /><br />\nnot only towards whites for their<br />\ninjustice against blacks, but<br />\ntowards his own people \u2022 for what<br />\nlie considered their lethargic<br />\nresponse to racial discrimination.<br />\nIn Everlasting Stain, Miller<br />\nemphasizes the necessity of Black<br />\npeople accepting responsibilities:<br />\n\"The Negro must contribute his<br />\nbest to the general welfare and<br />\nderive his just share form it. He<br />\nmust enter as competent and<br />\nwilling participant in the new<br />\nissue of life, and must not fail to<br />\nhelp promote the glory of that<br />\nnew freedom whose beneficiary<br />\nhe devoutly hopes to be.\"<br />\nChange<br />\nAlthough militant in his<br />\nunswerving struggle against<br />\nsegregation, Miller supported<br />\neducation rather than violence as<br />\nthe most effective agent of<br />\nchange. \"Let him insist upon<br />\nevery American right with the 1'<br />\ndotted and the 't' crossed,\" he<br />\nstated, \"but woe be to him who<br />\ncould lay destructive hand to tear<br />\ndown the temple of freedom.\"<br />\nMiller was associated with<br />\nHoward University for<br />\napproximately forty years,<br />\nduring which lie ceaselessly urged<br />\nblacks to overcome<br />\ndiscrimination with self-respect,<br />\nendurance and education, not<br />\nviolence.<br />\nMany of the issues Miller dealt<br />\nwith in his books and pamphlets<br /><br />\nwere t ra nsi tory, but his<br />\neloquence was not. In a rebuttal<br />\nof Thomas Dixon's novel<br />\nattacking Blacks, Leopard Spots,<br />\nMiller wrote: \"You are a white<br />\n\u2022 man born in the midst of the<br />\nCivil War: I am a Negro born<br />\nduring the same stirring epoch.<br />\nYou are born with a silver spoon<br />\nin your mouth: I was born with<br />\nan iron hoe in my hand.\" His<br />\ncommand of the language reveals<br />\na delightful humor in addition to<br />\nthe more dignified style of his<br />\npolitical writings: \"This<br />\nffusion\" he said of a book<br />\nwhich he loaded down with large<br />\nwords, \"is but the garrulity of<br />\nThe septugenerian who should be<br />\nrelegated to the limbo of<br />\nsilence.\"<br />\nMiller died in 1939, after<br />\n.spending his later years living<br />\nwith his wife Annie May Butler<br />\nMiller near the Howard<br />\nUniversity campus.

Overall, the cagers<br />\nwent 1-3 for the week, but<br />\nclinched a playoff berth for the<br />\nchance to go to the NCAA<br />\nDivision III championship<br />\ntournament.<br />\nFollowing a \"close, but no<br />\ncigar\" effort against the tough<br />\nPioneers of Widener College last<br />\nSaturday, the Hopkins hoopsters<br />\ntravelled to Lancaster, Pa. on<br />\nMonday, :where they received<br />\nanother setback; this time at the<br />\nhands of Franklin and Marshall.<br />\nWednesday night found the<br />\nJays at home trying to clinch a<br />\nplayoff spot against Haverford<br />\nCollege- a task at which they<br />\nwere successful.

The score is<br />\nirrelevant when one considers the<br />\nfact that the result was<br />\ndetermined by the last event<br />\nwhich the Terps won by only .08<br />\nseconds!<br />\nThe meet got off to a fine<br />\nstart as the Terrapins won the<br />\n400-yard medley relay with a<br />\ntime of 3:42.7. This set the stage<br />\nfor a showdown in the 1000-yard<br />\nfreestyle between Hopkins' Mike<br />\nBay and Maryland's Sid Burkot.<br />\nThe two swimmers went<br />\nstroke for stroke for all 40<br />\nlengths with Bay holding a slight<br />\nedge until Burkot came on strong<br />\nand touched just before the<br />\nfreshman Jay by .12 seconds. It<br />\nseemed as though the meet could<br />\nonly go on to be anti-climactic<br />\nafter such an event but this was<br />\nnot the case.<br />\nThe 200-yard freestyle<br />\nfollowed and this saw Eric<br />\nHorning cut four seconds off of<br />\nhis career best time to take a<br />\nsecond place. This would be the<br />\nbest meet of Horning's career as<br />\nhe later finished second in the<br />\n500-yard freestyle with an<br />\noutstanding time of 5:02.7 which<br />\nwas his career best by nearly nine<br />\nseconds.<br />\nMarc Tohis had little trouble<br />\nwith his opponents as he won the<br />\none-meter diving competition<br />\nwith Mike DiCio finishing third.<br />\nAnother thrilling event<br />\nfollowed in the 200-yard<br />\nbutter fly as freshman Frank<br />\nMcGovern passed the Terp leader<br />\non the last lap to win with a<br />\nnational Division III qualifying<br />\ntime of 2:01.1.<br />\nRoy Beveridge and captain<br />\nJim Spiering finished second and<br />\nthird in the 100-yard freestyle as<br />\nMike Bay went on to .win the<br />\n200-yard backstroke. It was in<br />\nthis event that junior John<br />\nDierkes swam his best time of the<br />\nyear to finish second.<br />\nMaryland's captain Bob<br />\nHassett, considered by many to<br />\nbe one of the finest<br />\nbreaststrokers in the country. ran<br />\naway with the 200-yarder as he<br />\nset a new pool record with a time<br /><br />\nof 2:14.07, breaking the old<br />\nmark by more than two seconds.<br />\nHopkins now held a one<br />\npoint lead going into the<br />\nthree-meter diving competition,<br />\nwhere the hosts were considered<br />\nto hold a slight edge. If the Jay<br />\ndivers could take first and<br />\nsecond, the meet would be<br />\nclinched.<br />\nThis was not to be the case<br />\nhowever, as Maryland finished<br />\nfirst and second with the top<br />\nfour spots separated by merely<br />\nfive points.<br />\nThe meet would now go<br />\ndown to the 400-yard freestyle<br />\nrelay where the Terrapins held a<br />\nconsiderable edge. Hopkins still<br />\nhad a mathematical chance of<br />\nwinning the meet if it could take<br />\nthe relay. They trailed 56-50, but<br />\nthe relay was worth seven points.<br />\nWhat followed was the most<br />\nsuspenseful and sensational finale<br />\nin many years.<br />\nJim Spiering, Mike Bay, and<br />\nFrank Jones gave the Blue Jays<br />\nan unexpected slight lead going<br />\nto the last 100 yards. Anchorman<br />\nRoy Beveridge swam a great leg<br />\nbut was only caught by the<br />\nMaryland swimmer who swam<br />\nthe best 100 yards ever at<br />\nHopkins at 47.8. The final<br />\ndecision had to be made by, a<br />\ncomputer brought in for the<br />\nmeet which saw the Terrapins<br />\nwin the relay by .08 seconds. The<br />\nBlue Jay time was more than<br />\nfour seconds better than their<br />\nprevious best of the year. The<br />\nfour swimmers all swam the best<br />\n100 yard times of their careers as<br />\nthe team fell just so short of a<br />\nmajor upset.<br />\nCoach Frank Comfort was<br />\nunderstandably disappointed by<br />\nthe loss but was thrilled by the<br />\nfine performances turned in by<br />\nall. \"We were hoping at best to<br />\nget the meet down to the relay<br />\nwhere they, of course, were<br />\nconsiderable favorites. We only<br />\nfinished first in 4 of 13 events<br />\nbut our fine depth allowed us to<br />\nachieve our goal. I was elated by<br />\nthe performances of the<br />\nswimmers in the relay and<br />\nconsidered this to be the most<br />\nspectacular meet to be held in<br />\nthis area for a long time.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays now own a 6-6<br />\nrecord with most of their losses<br /><br />\ncoming against NCAA Division 1<br />\nteams. Their next meet will be<br />\nheld at Dickinson College today<br />\nas the team prepares for the 29th<br />\nAnnual MAC Championships to<br />\nbe held at Homewood pool this<br />\nFriday, Saturday, and.Sunday.<br />\nMeanwhile in a meet which<br />\nperhaps better exhibits the<br />\noverall strength of the Hopkins<br />\nswimming programs as it has<br />\nbeen built by Coach Frank<br />\nComfort than any other, the<br />\nHopkins \"B\" team won the first<br />\nTri-State Championship swim<br />\nmeet against the varsity swim<br />\nteams of major universities like<br />\nTowson State, Loyola, Morgan<br />\nState, Coppin State and York<br />\nCollege among others, at Towson<br />\nState.<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jays out-distanced<br />\nsecond place Towson 139-118<br />\nthus avenging an earlier season<br />\ndefeat administered them by the<br />\nTigers.<br />\nBill Sick highlighted the<br />\nHomewood performances by<br />\ntaking firsts in both the 100 and<br />\n200 breast, turning in the best<br />\n100 time of any Comforteer ever<br />\nunshaved. Tim Culiinan was a<br />\nfinalist and second place finisher<br />\nin both of the above mentioned<br />\nevents while Ty Lanahan<br />\ncaptured the 200 free.<br />\nHopkins dominated the<br />\ndiving with Dave Scotti and Jay<br />\nDarrell finishing 1-2 in the 3<br />\nmeter.

That is what has<br />\nhappened at Hopkins: top<br />\nplayers on the women's tennis<br />\nteam have been given extensive<br />\ntraining in the fundamentals and<br />\nstrategy of squash. A good<br />\npercentage of this year's players<br />\nare freshmen, and, with such a<br />\nstrong first year showing, their<br />\nfuture is very bright.<br />\nCommenting on the team's<br />\nearly problems, Hogan explained<br />\nthat many questions and some<br />\ncomplaints arose concerning<br />\npractice time on the courts<br />\nalloted to \u2022 the team. But those<br />\nquestions have turned to support,<br />\nas she explained, \"The degree of<br />\nspectator support in interest in<br />\nwomen's squash I have observed<br />\nboth at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania and at our matches<br />\nhere at Hopkins is astounding.\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41102, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "613d874f-ac87-40ef-b23a-49a9c9c8c69a", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14305-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14305, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "137a0529-aa74-4aa6-b9be-78e01450024c", "url": "/node/14305"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "425bfb13-c24e-4fda-9bd5-48ea322f8729"}]}
