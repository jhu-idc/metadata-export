The megaphones, the<br />\nlleW cheers, the parade, the dummy, the bonfire abetted an enthusiasm already aroused by thoughts<br />\nof a real conflict. Leber and the<br />\nrest of the acrobatic yell directot s had the .cheering section well<br />\nit) hand, and that good team of<br />\now s did get support.<br />\nIt's just the thing we need\u2014<br />\nmore good, live \"pep\" in everything Hopkins does. Besides, it<br />\npays to advertise, and Hopkins<br />\ngot advertising last week. Staid<br />\nBaltimoreans woke up to the fact<br />\nthat they have a real, howling,<br />\nspirited college out at Homewood,<br />\nattd not just a handsome group of<br />\nColonial buildings. They may<br />\nsoon feel natural when they see<br />\nthe red glow of the bonfire and<br />\nneglect to send in a fire alarm.<br />\nOn Thanksgiving Day we are going to meet an old rival that<br />\nHopkins used to lick, and lick<br />\nsoundly. Our opponents may have<br />\nthe edge on us in weight and experience, and some may hold the<br />\nodds in their favor, but if the<br />\nsame spirit makes every man at<br />\nHopkins\u2014senior, junior and soph,<br />\nas well as freshman\u2014mass into<br />\nthe stands and set the very earth<br />\nvibrating with intense enthusiasm,<br />\nwe'll give the Aggies the fight of<br />\ntheir lives, if not a knock-out defeat.<br />\n<br />\nThe New Hullabaloo.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the rumor first Mile to<br />\nour ears that our -Hullabaloo,\"<br />\nthe yell par excellence, was to be<br />\ncut in half, we were tempted to<br />\nsend up a cry of horror. Then we<br />\nheard a little talk by Mr. Swindell, Class of '97, and came down<br />\nto earth. We realized that the<br />\ntraditional war-cry, so fondly believed to be irreproachable, sounded to the uninitiated like a descent from a coal wagon, and was,<br />\nfrom the middle on, really indistinguishable. We were forced to<br />\nadmit that the newer version did<br />\nhave the punch, did carry the<br />\nmessage, and was capable of expressing the enthusiasm of a<br />\ncrowd of rooters as their united<br />\neffort.<br />\nBy the manner in which the<br />\nyell has been received by the majority of students, we feel safe in<br />\nstating that the innovation will<br />\nbe a success. When one of ourselves gets up and says that one<br />\nof our hallowed institutions must<br />\nbe changed, he is ignored or<br />\nlaughed down ; it takes somebody<br />\nfrrnn outside to tell us the bitter<br />\ntruth. The next thing needed is<br />\nthe composition of three or four<br />\nmore yells with the same things<br />\nin view: punch, coherence and<br />\nbrevity. The football season is<br />\nnearly over, but the lacrosse and<br />\nbaseball teams need unified rooting as well as the followers of the<br />\npigskin.<br />\nIn conclusion, we wish to tender our best thanks to Mr. Swindell, and express our hope that he<br />\ngive us any more tips as soon as<br />\nthey occur to him.<br />\n'VARSITY CLUB ORGANIZED<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\n<br />\n\"Men who have played in class<br />\ngames upon class teams at a time<br />\nwhen there was no 'Varsity team,<br />\nor men who have participated actively in sports without receiving<br />\nthe 'IL' are eligible for election<br />\nby unanimous vote of the executive board ; and may wear the insignia of the sport in which they<br />\nso participated, when so elected.\"<br />\nAfter the adoption of the constitution, the following men were<br />\nelected as ofticers: President, Eveleth Bridgeman ; vice-presidents,<br />\nHarry Stone, Joseph England,<br />\nRobertson Griswold and Reaney<br />\nWolf; secretary-treasurer, Guy<br />\nHoliday.<br />\nAfter some discussion on the<br />\nquestion of unit lag with the<br />\nAlumni Association in appointing<br />\nstanding committees to act as advisers, the meeting adjourned.<br />\nAmong the alma iii present<br />\nwere: George Radcliffe, Horace<br />\nBurrows, Theodore Straus, \"Ben\"<br />\nTappan, Morphit Mullen, Carrol<br />\nSollenwerk,\u2022 Eveleth Bridgeman,<br />\n\"Joe\" England, Marion Hopkins,<br />\nJohn DeWitt, \"Ben\" Griswold,<br />\nJr., Emory Niles, Edwin Jarrett,<br />\nWilmer Darley, Eugene Edgett,<br />\nArthur Primrose, Vincent Brooks,<br />\nJohnson Poe and Coach Murphy.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAILBAG<br />\nQUACKS FROM A QUACK<br />\nA Column in Which the Correspondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulder the Responsibility.<br />\n<br />\nwant to state here and now<br />\nthat the next young sport who<br />\ntries, by fair means or foul, .to<br />\nkid me about the'manner in which<br />\nexecute may editorial duties will<br />\nAll letters 'Intended for publication<br />\nmust be concise.<br />\nreceive such a roasting from my<br />\nNo attention will be paid to anonygifted *pen that if the Dean sees<br />\nmous letters, but names signed as an<br />\nevidence of good faith will not be printed<br />\nit (and seeing is believing) the<br />\nIf request is made that they be omitted.<br />\nabove-mentioned young sport will<br />\nThe publication of a letter is<br />\nto be<br />\ntaken as an indorsement of its not<br />\nbe abruptly asked to cash . in his<br />\nviews by<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, which invites the<br />\nlocker key.<br />\nfreest discussion of matters of general<br />\ninterest.<br />\nBut let us rightly turn our<br />\nfancy to more jovial and jubilant<br />\nDebutante Damns Editor.<br />\naffairs.

Although<br />\na small group of laborers still<br />\nhold to the extreme socialistic doctrine of the abolition of state in<br />\ngovernment, there is, on the whole,<br />\na gradual transition in feeling toward the ownership of all means<br />\nof production by a high joint council of the state and a representation of the laborers, and the management in the hands of an administration chosen by the laborers in that industry. Stock for<br />\nnew industries would be floated<br />\nby an issue of bonds in denominations small enough to be taken<br />\nby the laborers. Control of profit,<br />\nafter the payment of expenses and<br />\ninterest on the bond issue, would be<br />\ngiven to the high council. The disposition would probably be made<br />\nthrough an increase in wages, a<br />\nreturn of the surplus to the industry for enlargement, or a redemption of the bonds. For the<br />\nfactory management, a representative system would be used.; that<br />\nis, operation workmen would elect<br />\na fellow-workman, who would in<br />\nturn vote for a representative for<br />\nthe shop, and so on until the managing board for the entire industry was chosen.<br />\nAs an example of this new theory of nmnagement, Dr. Heatherington told of an airplane factory,<br />\nwhich, after yielding a good return to the promoters, was turned<br />\nover to management by the employees. The factory under their<br />\ncontrol during the war was run in<br />\nsuch a way as to make it the most<br />\nefficient factory of its size in output, management, large returns<br />\nand peaceful labor conditions.<br />\n<br />\nhave.

During<br />\nthe hour before the time set for<br />\nthe meeting, a large number of<br />\nstudents gathered in front of the<br />\nBarn around a coffin upon which<br />\nlay the prostrate form of \"Old St.<br />\nJohn's.\" A freshman armed with<br />\none of the famous \"Tinfield\" rifles<br />\nmarched solemnly around the body<br />\nand held back those who ventured<br />\ntoo near.<br />\nPromptly at 12.25, Cheer Leader<br />\n\"Charley\" Leber organized the<br />\ncrowd into a long column, which<br />\nbegan to march around between<br />\nthe engineering buildings.

The megaphones, the<br />\nlleW cheers, the parade, the dummy, the bonfire abetted an enthusiasm already aroused by thoughts<br />\nof a real conflict.

Then we<br />\nheard a little talk by Mr. Swindell, Class of '97, and came down<br />\nto earth. We realized that the<br />\ntraditional war-cry, so fondly believed to be irreproachable, sounded to the uninitiated like a descent from a coal wagon, and was,<br />\nfrom the middle on, really indistinguishable. We were forced to<br />\nadmit that the newer version did<br />\nhave the punch, did carry the<br />\nmessage, and was capable of expressing the enthusiasm of a<br />\ncrowd of rooters as their united<br />\neffort.<br />\nBy the manner in which the<br />\nyell has been received by the majority of students, we feel safe in<br />\nstating that the innovation will<br />\nbe a success. When one of ourselves gets up and says that one<br />\nof our hallowed institutions must<br />\nbe changed, he is ignored or<br />\nlaughed down ; it takes somebody<br />\nfrrnn outside to tell us the bitter<br />\ntruth. The next thing needed is<br />\nthe composition of three or four<br />\nmore yells with the same things<br />\nin view: punch, coherence and<br />\nbrevity. The football season is<br />\nnearly over, but the lacrosse and<br />\nbaseball teams need unified rooting as well as the followers of the<br />\npigskin.<br />\nIn conclusion, we wish to tender our best thanks to Mr. Swindell, and express our hope that he<br />\ngive us any more tips as soon as<br />\nthey occur to him.<br />\n'VARSITY CLUB ORGANIZED<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br /><br />\n\"Men who have played in class<br />\ngames upon class teams at a time<br />\nwhen there was no 'Varsity team,<br />\nor men who have participated actively in sports without receiving<br />\nthe 'IL' are eligible for election<br />\nby unanimous vote of the executive board ; and may wear the insignia of the sport in which they<br />\nso participated, when so elected.\"<br />\nAfter the adoption of the constitution, the following men were<br />\nelected as ofticers: President, Eveleth Bridgeman ; vice-presidents,<br />\nHarry Stone, Joseph England,<br />\nRobertson Griswold and Reaney<br />\nWolf; secretary-treasurer, Guy<br />\nHoliday.<br />\nAfter some discussion on the<br />\nquestion of unit lag with the<br />\nAlumni Association in appointing<br />\nstanding committees to act as advisers, the meeting adjourned.<br />\nAmong the alma iii present<br />\nwere: George Radcliffe, Horace<br />\nBurrows, Theodore Straus, \"Ben\"<br />\nTappan, Morphit Mullen, Carrol<br />\nSollenwerk,\u2022 Eveleth Bridgeman,<br />\n\"Joe\" England, Marion Hopkins,<br />\nJohn DeWitt, \"Ben\" Griswold,<br />\nJr., Emory Niles, Edwin Jarrett,<br />\nWilmer Darley, Eugene Edgett,<br />\nArthur Primrose, Vincent Brooks,<br />\nJohnson Poe and Coach Murphy.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAILBAG<br />\nQUACKS FROM A QUACK<br />\nA Column in Which the Correspondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulder the Responsibility.<br /><br />\nwant to state here and now<br />\nthat the next young sport who<br />\ntries, by fair means or foul, .to<br />\nkid me about the'manner in which<br />\nexecute may editorial duties will<br />\nAll letters 'Intended for publication<br />\nmust be concise.<br />\nreceive such a roasting from my<br />\nNo attention will be paid to anonygifted *pen that if the Dean sees<br />\nmous letters, but names signed as an<br />\nevidence of good faith will not be printed<br />\nit (and seeing is believing) the<br />\nIf request is made that they be omitted.<br />\nabove-mentioned young sport will<br />\nThe publication of a letter is<br />\nto be<br />\ntaken as an indorsement of its not<br />\nbe abruptly asked to cash . in his<br />\nviews by<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, which invites the<br />\nlocker key.<br />\nfreest discussion of matters of general<br />\ninterest.<br />\nBut let us rightly turn our<br />\nfancy to more jovial and jubilant<br />\nDebutante Damns Editor.<br />\naffairs.

A. C.<br /><br />\nDr. Heatherington, of the British Labor Commission, recently<br />\nconvened in Washington, addressed the Social Science Club<br />\nrecently after a dinner at the Hopkins Club. In addition to the faculty members and graduate students in the Economic Department, several instructors from<br />\nGoucher were present.

Although<br />\na small group of laborers still<br />\nhold to the extreme socialistic doctrine of the abolition of state in<br />\ngovernment, there is, on the whole,<br />\na gradual transition in feeling toward the ownership of all means<br />\nof production by a high joint council of the state and a representation of the laborers, and the management in the hands of an administration chosen by the laborers in that industry. Stock for<br />\nnew industries would be floated<br />\nby an issue of bonds in denominations small enough to be taken<br />\nby the laborers. Control of profit,<br />\nafter the payment of expenses and<br />\ninterest on the bond issue, would be<br />\ngiven to the high council. The disposition would probably be made<br />\nthrough an increase in wages, a<br />\nreturn of the surplus to the industry for enlargement, or a redemption of the bonds. For the<br />\nfactory management, a representative system would be used.; that<br />\nis, operation workmen would elect<br />\na fellow-workman, who would in<br />\nturn vote for a representative for<br />\nthe shop, and so on until the managing board for the entire industry was chosen.<br />\nAs an example of this new theory of nmnagement, Dr. Heatherington told of an airplane factory,<br />\nwhich, after yielding a good return to the promoters, was turned<br />\nover to management by the employees. The factory under their<br />\ncontrol during the war was run in<br />\nsuch a way as to make it the most<br />\nefficient factory of its size in output, management, large returns<br />\nand peaceful labor conditions.<br /><br />\nhave.
