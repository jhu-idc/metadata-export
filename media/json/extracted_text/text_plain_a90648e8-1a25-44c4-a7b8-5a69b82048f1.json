Smith in the<br />\nsixth of the series of lectures on<br />\n\"Aspects of the World War\" in<br />\nCivil Engineering Hall on last<br />\nWednesday. Major Smith, who is<br />\nnow in Surgeon-General Gorgas'<br />\noffice at Washington, was formerly<br />\nsuperintendent of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n\"In his address on \"Medical Aspects of the War,\" delivered before a large gathering of medical<br />\nmen, professors, and army officers,<br />\nMajor Smith declared that the soldier now has a 90 per cent. better<br />\nchance for his life than at the outset of the war. He said that while<br />\nin previous wars more men died<br />\nfrom disease than actual fighting<br />\nthe reverse is now true.<br />\nMajor Smith denied the report<br />\nthat Great Britain has lost 66,000<br />\ndoctors in action. As a matter of<br />\nfact, asserted Major Smith, there<br />\nwere only 35,000 doctors in England before the war, and that the<br />\nnumber killed was only 250,and 55<br />\nof these did not die from war effects. In France, said Major<br />\nSmith, tuberculosis is less prevalent now than it was before the<br />\nwar, and typhoid, once a dreaded<br />\nscourge, has been completely<br />\nwiped out.<br />\nModern surgery, said Major<br />\nSmith, has already saved more men<br />\nin this war than Napoleon had in<br />\nhis armies. In fact, he said, military surgery had been revolutionized, and of the wounded 80 per<br />\ncent. are sent back fit for service.<br />\nMajor Smith said that the Government will soon have in service<br />\n25,000 medical officers, 40,000<br />\nnurses and 300,000 Hospital Corps<br />\nmen:<br />\nWhile Germany is exerting all<br />\nher fiendish ingenuity to discover<br />\nand apply new means of torture,<br />\ngreat discoveries in medicine are<br />\nbeing *made by the Allied countries, said Major Smith. At the<br />\nsame time, he continued, every effort is being made to preserve also<br />\nthe moral health of the soldier.<br />\nMajor Smith asked his audience<br />\nto shut their eyes to the end. \"The<br />\nend of the war is not yet nor is<br />\nthe end even in sight.\" He asserted that the women will soon have<br />\nto take the place of the men in<br />\nthe industries during this war. He<br />\nmade a plea for universal service,<br />\n<br />\nit was to Japan, standing guard<br />\nover China and fearing \"the establishment of a strong European<br />\nPower on the eastern shore of the<br />\nAsiatic continent, and to Germany, making sea routes to the<br />\nOrient unsafe by the use of the<br />\nsubmarine, while she extended her<br />\npower over interior railroad routes<br />\nto the East, that President Dr. F.<br />\nJ. Goodnow devoted chief attention on last Friday afternoon in<br />\nhis address on the war as it affected the Far East. The lecture,<br />\nthe sixth of the lectures on \"Aspects of the World War,\" was delivered in the lecture hall of the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building at<br />\nHomewood to an audience which<br />\npacked the hall and overflowed<br />\ninto the corridors.<br />\nThis policy of Germany, said Dr<br />\nGoodnow, threatened the economic<br />\nunity of the nations of the earth.<br />\nEconomic unity had in the past<br />\nbeen the greatest element in drawing the nations to closer bonds of<br />\nunderstanding. If Germany succeeded in these designs, said Dr.<br />\nGoodnow,\"the freedom of the seas<br />\nwill have been destroyed, the<br />\neconomic unity of the world seriously impaired and the work of<br />\ncenturies rendered of little or no<br />\navail,<br />\n<br />\nConfident of scoring an easy victory over their younger and less<br />\nexperienced opponents, the Senior<br />\nDebating Team met its waterloo<br />\non Saturday night in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Hall at the hands of<br />\nthe clever Juniors. The result of<br />\nthe twenty-first annual interclass<br />\ndebate was a unanimous decision<br />\nin favor of the class of 1919. The<br />\npublic speaking contest, limited to<br />\nmembers of the Sophomore class<br />\nwas won by John H. Lewin.<br />\nIn the absence of Dr. John C.<br />\nFrench, who was unable to attend<br />\non account of illness, Mr. John<br />\nEarl Uhler, A. B., 1913, and instructor in English, presided over<br />\nthe hostilities.<br />\nThe first speaker in the PublicSpeaking Contest was Leslie C.<br />\nBeard, Jr., who recited President<br />\nWilson's Flag Day address. George<br />\nS. Lachman followed with President Wilson's war message. John<br />\nH. Lewin who spoke last, gave a<br />\nfrom Grady's speech on<br />\nselection'<br />\nCentralization.<br />\nThe subject of the debate was:<br />\nResolved, That the Government of<br />\nthe United States should immediately conscript each resident of<br />\nthis country who is not engaged<br />\nin military duty for such other<br />\nservice during the war as the Government shall deem each bestfitted<br />\nto perform.<br />\nThe first speaker for the affirmative which was upheld by the Class<br />\nof 1918 was Morton K. Rothschild,<br />\nwho, contrary to all debating traditions, read his speech. Roszel C.<br />\nThomsen opened the argument for<br />\nthe negative with a convincing and<br />\nforceful speech. Adolf L. Hamburger, the second speaker for the affirmative, was emphatic and eloquent. Leo W. Simon, in a clever<br />\nspeech, turned the arguments of<br />\nhis opponents to his advantage.<br />\nIt remained for Frank V. Morley,\u2022<br />\nrebuttal for the affirmative, to win<br />\nover the audience with a keen<br />\nanalysis of the negative case and<br />\nan able refutation of their salient<br />\npoints. Immediately after Henry<br />\nS.

But it was on a tour<br />\nof inspection of the Southern<br />\ntraining camps that we took together a short time before he died<br />\nwhen I came to know him really<br />\nwell. I saw him laboring among<br />\nthose thousands of soldiers in<br />\nthose camps, working from morning to night, and it was then that<br />\nI came into contact with his real<br />\ncharacter. As a result of that<br />\ntrip, I have lost by his death not<br />\nonly an able assistant, but a personal friend to whom I was greatly attached.<br />\n\"I have heard people say that it<br />\nis a pity when men are cut off in<br />\ntheir prime. I don't know that I<br />\nreally think so. I have often<br />\nthought Stonewall Jackson was<br />\nthe most fortunate of soldiers. He<br />\nhad achieved success; he was a<br />\ncommander who had won enviable<br />\nhonors. On the day of his death<br />\nhe had been victorious; he had rescued his command from a difficult<br />\nposition; he saw the enemy in full<br />\nretreat; so far as he knew, his<br />\ncause would win. No regret could<br />\nhave been his before he.was killed.<br />\n\"What more could Janeway<br />\nhave wished? He had been recognized successful. The only thing<br />\nhe could have regretted was the<br />\ntwenty more years of usefulness<br />\nthat might have been his.

The only<br />\nway in which to save that life is to<br />\ndestroy Germany's land power, or<br />\nto cause her to realize that the<br />\nworld will not permit any nation<br />\nso to conduct herself as to imperil ideals which, after so many<br />\nyears of toil and trouble, have received all but universal recognition.\" He called attention to the<br />\nfact that the recent cessions of ter(Continued on page 10, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nwhich he believed would make the<br />\nUnited States a nation of healthy<br />\nmen, and also asked that every effort be taken to decrease the startling amount of infant mortality. ,,<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 18, 1918.<br />\n<br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\n(II Besides, the reputation of an old-established firm is<br />\nback of each sale with a guarantee.<br />\n<br />\nJohn C.

He<br />\nspoke also of the value of chemists<br />\nin factory 'work and the opportunities for advance along this line.<br />\nThere are ten essential principles in factory management according to the speaker, which are<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\nas follows.<br />\n1. Proper selection of workmen<br />\nis necessary to efficient work.<br />\n2. These men must be properly<br />\ntrained to 'do their specific work.<br />\n3. There must be recognition<br />\nand reward by the authorities for<br />\nindividual efficiency.<br />\n4. There must be some incentive to advancement held open to<br />\nall, in order to make the men interested in the work.<br />\n5. There must be stimulation<br />\nof self-interest, which is' best<br />\nbrought about by means of competition.<br />\n6. To have co-operation among<br />\nthe men there should be an ever<br />\npresent\"esprit de corps,\" a spirit<br />\nof pride in the undertaking and<br />\ninterest in the results.<br />\n7. Frankness between the manager and men is essential to mutual aid.<br />\n8. Conditions about the plant<br />\nshould be as congenial as possible<br />\nfor the men. Sanitation should be<br />\nof the highest order, and in all<br />\nways possible the men should be<br />\nwell cared for.<br />\n9. Operating systems should be<br />\nstandardized.<br />\n10. Rigid discipline must be<br />\nmaintained.<br />\n\u2022 The speaker then gave an account of the existing labor situation in factories. Both skilled and<br />\nunskilled workmen have been selected for the National Army or<br />\nput into different branches of Government work. As a result of<br />\nthese losses it has been necessary<br />\nto employ women, as has been<br />\n<br />\nAt the regular hour for military<br />\nlecture last Wednesday, Prof.<br />\nFrank P. McKibben, formerly of<br />\nLehigh University but now connected with the United States<br />\nShipping Board, spoke on the vital necessity of more Jnerchant<br />\nships to our country. Dr. Goodnow introduced the speaker, emphasizing the fact that the innnitude of the shipping problem<br />\nmust be brought home forcefully<br />\nso that all can help.<br />\nProfessor McKibben opened his<br />\nspeech with the statement that<br />\ntwo of the three important links<br />\nnecessary for our success in the<br />\nwar are ready\u2014namel,'the army<br />\nand production \u2014 but that the<br />\na merchant marine \u2014 is<br />\nthird<br />\nwanting. Enormous supplies are<br />\nneeded- daily by our army abroad,<br />\nhe said, and:these must be _carried<br />\nover at any' cost. Moreover, our<br />\naeroplanes,'which many claim will<br />\nbe a big /factor in winning the<br />\nwar, must be transported in ships.<br />\n\"A prominent shipbuilder told<br />\nme the other day,\" Mr. McKibben remarked, !\"that unless we<br />\nbuild more merchant ships than<br />\nwe are now building, we will be<br />\ndefeated by Germany\u2014and 1 agree<br />\nwith him. Our navy is in excellent condition, but our merchant<br />\nmarine is most inadequate. To<br />\nmake it large enough, the United<br />\nStates must - build ten ships a<br />\nweek. Already 517 steel ships and<br />\n400 wooden and composite ships are<br />\ncontracted for, but what the Government is up against is where to<br />\nget the labor to build them.<br />\nSteel plates and rivets are abundant, but the yards and trained<br />\nworkers are needed.\" The speaker<br />\ncited an instance of a riveter making, by working overtime, $175 in<br />\none week.<br />\nA brief explanation of why we<br />\nshould send over men and supplies to defeat Germany was set<br />\nforth. The Pan-German menace<br />\nwas discussed, and it was mentioned that as far back as 1911\u2014<br />\nthree years before the war \u2014 a<br />\nbook by Tannenburg, called<br />\n\"Greater Germany,\" was pubdone in England, and it has been<br />\nfound that, although physically<br />\nunable to do some work, they are<br />\napt and conscientious workers and<br />\nin all respects have \"made good.\"<br />\nHe closed by saying that labor<br />\nproblems will continue until it becomes decided what share of profits belongs to capital and what<br />\nshare to labor.<br />\n<br />\nlished in Leipsic. This book clearly stated Germany's thirst for<br />\nworld dominion:<br />\nThe latter part of Professor McKibben's lecture was illustrated<br />\nby lantern slides, dealing for the<br />\nmost part with the different typos<br />\nof ships and their construction.<br />\nSome most interesting points were<br />\ndiscussed: how the ships returning empty from France must carry huge supplies of water as ballast; how ships are raised from the<br />\nbottom and made fit for further<br />\nsailing; how ships-,*. are camouflaged for concealment in the<br />\nwaves.; how concrete Alps are<br />\nconstructed, the largest in the<br />\nworld having recently been built<br />\nin the United States.<br />\nIn closing, the speaker, explained that he did not wish to<br />\npersuade anyone to leave college,<br />\nfor he strongly advised all students to stick to their posts in<br />\norder to make themselves -more fit<br />\nfor future service. He did wish,<br />\nhowever, that every student who<br />\ncould possibly do so ,would work<br />\nin the shipyards during his summer vacation:<br />\nMajor Guild, at the close of the<br />\nhour, said that he intended to don<br />\noveralls this summer if Uncle Sam<br />\ndid not need him elsewhere, and<br />\nthat other members of the faculty<br />\nwould also work during their va*cation to make our merchant marine adequate: After he had finished, approximately 100 students<br />\nsigned their names as volunteer<br />\nshipbuilders.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n(\u2014 Collar - Hug Clothes I<br />\nCollege Men<br />\nhave a reputation for smart dressing.

Smith in the<br />\nsixth of the series of lectures on<br />\n\"Aspects of the World War\" in<br />\nCivil Engineering Hall on last<br />\nWednesday. Major Smith, who is<br />\nnow in Surgeon-General Gorgas'<br />\noffice at Washington, was formerly<br />\nsuperintendent of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n\"In his address on \"Medical Aspects of the War,\" delivered before a large gathering of medical<br />\nmen, professors, and army officers,<br />\nMajor Smith declared that the soldier now has a 90 per cent. better<br />\nchance for his life than at the outset of the war. He said that while<br />\nin previous wars more men died<br />\nfrom disease than actual fighting<br />\nthe reverse is now true.<br />\nMajor Smith denied the report<br />\nthat Great Britain has lost 66,000<br />\ndoctors in action. As a matter of<br />\nfact, asserted Major Smith, there<br />\nwere only 35,000 doctors in England before the war, and that the<br />\nnumber killed was only 250,and 55<br />\nof these did not die from war effects. In France, said Major<br />\nSmith, tuberculosis is less prevalent now than it was before the<br />\nwar, and typhoid, once a dreaded<br />\nscourge, has been completely<br />\nwiped out.<br />\nModern surgery, said Major<br />\nSmith, has already saved more men<br />\nin this war than Napoleon had in<br />\nhis armies. In fact, he said, military surgery had been revolutionized, and of the wounded 80 per<br />\ncent. are sent back fit for service.<br />\nMajor Smith said that the Government will soon have in service<br />\n25,000 medical officers, 40,000<br />\nnurses and 300,000 Hospital Corps<br />\nmen:<br />\nWhile Germany is exerting all<br />\nher fiendish ingenuity to discover<br />\nand apply new means of torture,<br />\ngreat discoveries in medicine are<br />\nbeing *made by the Allied countries, said Major Smith. At the<br />\nsame time, he continued, every effort is being made to preserve also<br />\nthe moral health of the soldier.<br />\nMajor Smith asked his audience<br />\nto shut their eyes to the end. \"The<br />\nend of the war is not yet nor is<br />\nthe end even in sight.\" He asserted that the women will soon have<br />\nto take the place of the men in<br />\nthe industries during this war. He<br />\nmade a plea for universal service,<br /><br />\nit was to Japan, standing guard<br />\nover China and fearing \"the establishment of a strong European<br />\nPower on the eastern shore of the<br />\nAsiatic continent, and to Germany, making sea routes to the<br />\nOrient unsafe by the use of the<br />\nsubmarine, while she extended her<br />\npower over interior railroad routes<br />\nto the East, that President Dr. F.<br />\nJ. Goodnow devoted chief attention on last Friday afternoon in<br />\nhis address on the war as it affected the Far East. The lecture,<br />\nthe sixth of the lectures on \"Aspects of the World War,\" was delivered in the lecture hall of the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building at<br />\nHomewood to an audience which<br />\npacked the hall and overflowed<br />\ninto the corridors.<br />\nThis policy of Germany, said Dr<br />\nGoodnow, threatened the economic<br />\nunity of the nations of the earth.<br />\nEconomic unity had in the past<br />\nbeen the greatest element in drawing the nations to closer bonds of<br />\nunderstanding. If Germany succeeded in these designs, said Dr.<br />\nGoodnow,\"the freedom of the seas<br />\nwill have been destroyed, the<br />\neconomic unity of the world seriously impaired and the work of<br />\ncenturies rendered of little or no<br />\navail,<br /><br />\nConfident of scoring an easy victory over their younger and less<br />\nexperienced opponents, the Senior<br />\nDebating Team met its waterloo<br />\non Saturday night in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Hall at the hands of<br />\nthe clever Juniors. The result of<br />\nthe twenty-first annual interclass<br />\ndebate was a unanimous decision<br />\nin favor of the class of 1919. The<br />\npublic speaking contest, limited to<br />\nmembers of the Sophomore class<br />\nwas won by John H. Lewin.<br />\nIn the absence of Dr. John C.<br />\nFrench, who was unable to attend<br />\non account of illness, Mr. John<br />\nEarl Uhler, A. B., 1913, and instructor in English, presided over<br />\nthe hostilities.<br />\nThe first speaker in the PublicSpeaking Contest was Leslie C.<br />\nBeard, Jr., who recited President<br />\nWilson's Flag Day address. George<br />\nS. Lachman followed with President Wilson's war message. John<br />\nH. Lewin who spoke last, gave a<br />\nfrom Grady's speech on<br />\nselection'<br />\nCentralization.<br />\nThe subject of the debate was:<br />\nResolved, That the Government of<br />\nthe United States should immediately conscript each resident of<br />\nthis country who is not engaged<br />\nin military duty for such other<br />\nservice during the war as the Government shall deem each bestfitted<br />\nto perform.<br />\nThe first speaker for the affirmative which was upheld by the Class<br />\nof 1918 was Morton K. Rothschild,<br />\nwho, contrary to all debating traditions, read his speech. Roszel C.<br />\nThomsen opened the argument for<br />\nthe negative with a convincing and<br />\nforceful speech. Adolf L. Hamburger, the second speaker for the affirmative, was emphatic and eloquent. Leo W. Simon, in a clever<br />\nspeech, turned the arguments of<br />\nhis opponents to his advantage.<br />\nIt remained for Frank V. Morley,\u2022<br />\nrebuttal for the affirmative, to win<br />\nover the audience with a keen<br />\nanalysis of the negative case and<br />\nan able refutation of their salient<br />\npoints. Immediately after Henry<br />\nS.

But it was on a tour<br />\nof inspection of the Southern<br />\ntraining camps that we took together a short time before he died<br />\nwhen I came to know him really<br />\nwell. I saw him laboring among<br />\nthose thousands of soldiers in<br />\nthose camps, working from morning to night, and it was then that<br />\nI came into contact with his real<br />\ncharacter. As a result of that<br />\ntrip, I have lost by his death not<br />\nonly an able assistant, but a personal friend to whom I was greatly attached.<br />\n\"I have heard people say that it<br />\nis a pity when men are cut off in<br />\ntheir prime.

He<br />\nhad achieved success; he was a<br />\ncommander who had won enviable<br />\nhonors. On the day of his death<br />\nhe had been victorious; he had rescued his command from a difficult<br />\nposition; he saw the enemy in full<br />\nretreat; so far as he knew, his<br />\ncause would win. No regret could<br />\nhave been his before he.was killed.<br />\n\"What more could Janeway<br />\nhave wished? He had been recognized successful.

Proper selection of workmen<br />\nis necessary to efficient work.<br />\n2. These men must be properly<br />\ntrained to 'do their specific work.<br />\n3. There must be recognition<br />\nand reward by the authorities for<br />\nindividual efficiency.<br />\n4.

There must be stimulation<br />\nof self-interest, which is' best<br />\nbrought about by means of competition.<br />\n6. To have co-operation among<br />\nthe men there should be an ever<br />\npresent\"esprit de corps,\" a spirit<br />\nof pride in the undertaking and<br />\ninterest in the results.<br />\n7.

Rigid discipline must be<br />\nmaintained.<br />\n\u2022 The speaker then gave an account of the existing labor situation in factories.

McKibben, formerly of<br />\nLehigh University but now connected with the United States<br />\nShipping Board, spoke on the vital necessity of more Jnerchant<br />\nships to our country. Dr. Goodnow introduced the speaker, emphasizing the fact that the innnitude of the shipping problem<br />\nmust be brought home forcefully<br />\nso that all can help.<br />\nProfessor McKibben opened his<br />\nspeech with the statement that<br />\ntwo of the three important links<br />\nnecessary for our success in the<br />\nwar are ready\u2014namel,'the army<br />\nand production \u2014 but that the<br />\na merchant marine \u2014 is<br />\nthird<br />\nwanting. Enormous supplies are<br />\nneeded- daily by our army abroad,<br />\nhe said, and:these must be _carried<br />\nover at any' cost. Moreover, our<br />\naeroplanes,'which many claim will<br />\nbe a big /factor in winning the<br />\nwar, must be transported in ships.<br />\n\"A prominent shipbuilder told<br />\nme the other day,\" Mr. McKibben remarked, !\"that unless we<br />\nbuild more merchant ships than<br />\nwe are now building, we will be<br />\ndefeated by Germany\u2014and 1 agree<br />\nwith him. Our navy is in excellent condition, but our merchant<br />\nmarine is most inadequate. To<br />\nmake it large enough, the United<br />\nStates must - build ten ships a<br />\nweek. Already 517 steel ships and<br />\n400 wooden and composite ships are<br />\ncontracted for, but what the Government is up against is where to<br />\nget the labor to build them.<br />\nSteel plates and rivets are abundant, but the yards and trained<br />\nworkers are needed.\" The speaker<br />\ncited an instance of a riveter making, by working overtime, $175 in<br />\none week.<br />\nA brief explanation of why we<br />\nshould send over men and supplies to defeat Germany was set<br />\nforth. The Pan-German menace<br />\nwas discussed, and it was mentioned that as far back as 1911\u2014<br />\nthree years before the war \u2014 a<br />\nbook by Tannenburg, called<br />\n\"Greater Germany,\" was pubdone in England, and it has been<br />\nfound that, although physically<br />\nunable to do some work, they are<br />\napt and conscientious workers and<br />\nin all respects have \"made good.\"<br />\nHe closed by saying that labor<br />\nproblems will continue until it becomes decided what share of profits belongs to capital and what<br />\nshare to labor.<br /><br />\nlished in Leipsic.

He did wish,<br />\nhowever, that every student who<br />\ncould possibly do so ,would work<br />\nin the shipyards during his summer vacation:<br />\nMajor Guild, at the close of the<br />\nhour, said that he intended to don<br />\noveralls this summer if Uncle Sam<br />\ndid not need him elsewhere, and<br />\nthat other members of the faculty<br />\nwould also work during their va*cation to make our merchant marine adequate: After he had finished, approximately 100 students<br />\nsigned their names as volunteer<br />\nshipbuilders.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n(\u2014 Collar - Hug Clothes I<br />\nCollege Men<br />\nhave a reputation for smart dressing.
