In addition<br />\nto the new departmental office,<br />\nimprovements were made in<br />\nrooms belonging to the<br />\nDepartments of Electrical<br />\nEngineering and Psychology.<br />\nThe departure of the History<br />\nof Art Department from Gilman<br />\nHall allowed the Humanities<br />\nCenter to consolidate its offices<br />\non the first floor of that building.<br />\nThe former office of the<br />\nHumanities Center, adjacent to<br />\nthe Tudor and Stuart room, is<br />\nnow occupied by the Institute of<br />\nSouthern History.<br />\nPrior to relocation, the History<br />\nof Art Department was operating<br />\nwith offices scattered in Gilman<br />\nHall and in the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library. Professor<br />\nEgon Verheyen, the<br />\nDepartment's Chairman, had<br />\npressed to bring his department's<br />\nfacilities together since taking his<br />\nposition last year.

But if Garland Hall wants something on<br />\nthe record that badly, three paragraphs will cost only a fraction<br />\nof one secretary's work day and are inconspicuous enough to go<br />\nunnoticed on any campus bulletin board.<br />\nPerhaps the single flaw in the current proposal as it stands is<br />\nthe complex process of appointing a review board. Rather than<br />\nhold the SC President, the Vice-Chairman of the Faculty<br />\nGeneral Assembly, and the Executive Assistant for the<br />\nVice-President of the Homewood Divisions responsible for<br />\nappointing ad hoc committees to sit in judgement on any<br />\ndisciplinary matter that arises, why not simplify things by<br />\nholding these three individuals responsible for hearing and<br />\nacting on all complaints themselves? Any \"conviction\" would<br />\nhave to be unanimous, and the time consuming procedure of<br />\n\"jury selection\" would be avoided. Certainly, on any issue as<br />\ndelicate as disciplinary proceedings all three of these individuals<br />\nwould conduct themselves without impropriety.<br />\nThe appeals process under the Savitz compromise is placed in<br />\nthe lap of President Muller, which is- not altogether<br />\nunreasonable.

They want a free<br />\ngame. However, free games cannot<br />\nbe won by violence.

Mike Lenardo,<br />\na freshman, explained \"The whole<br />\nart of pinball is shaking the<br />\nmachine. Anyone who's good,<br />\nshakes.

In addition<br />\nto the new departmental office,<br />\nimprovements were made in<br />\nrooms belonging to the<br />\nDepartments of Electrical<br />\nEngineering and Psychology.<br />\nThe departure of the History<br />\nof Art Department from Gilman<br />\nHall allowed the Humanities<br />\nCenter to consolidate its offices<br />\non the first floor of that building.<br />\nThe former office of the<br />\nHumanities Center, adjacent to<br />\nthe Tudor and Stuart room, is<br />\nnow occupied by the Institute of<br />\nSouthern History.<br />\nPrior to relocation, the History<br />\nof Art Department was operating<br />\nwith offices scattered in Gilman<br />\nHall and in the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library. Professor<br />\nEgon Verheyen, the<br />\nDepartment's Chairman, had<br />\npressed to bring his department's<br />\nfacilities together since taking his<br />\nposition last year. He expressed<br />\nhis pleasure with the new<br />\narrangement.<br />\nThe space occupied by<br />\nVerheyen's department was<br />\ncontributed by three other<br />\ndepartments already established<br />\nin the build;ng. Most of the<br />\nremodeling consisted of covering<br />\nover exposed piping removing<br />\nsinks and other items, installing a<br />\nnew ceiling, and painting over the<br />\nwalls.

But if Garland Hall wants something on<br />\nthe record that badly, three paragraphs will cost only a fraction<br />\nof one secretary's work day and are inconspicuous enough to go<br />\nunnoticed on any campus bulletin board.<br />\nPerhaps the single flaw in the current proposal as it stands is<br />\nthe complex process of appointing a review board. Rather than<br />\nhold the SC President, the Vice-Chairman of the Faculty<br />\nGeneral Assembly, and the Executive Assistant for the<br />\nVice-President of the Homewood Divisions responsible for<br />\nappointing ad hoc committees to sit in judgement on any<br />\ndisciplinary matter that arises, why not simplify things by<br />\nholding these three individuals responsible for hearing and<br />\nacting on all complaints themselves? Any \"conviction\" would<br />\nhave to be unanimous, and the time consuming procedure of<br />\n\"jury selection\" would be avoided. Certainly, on any issue as<br />\ndelicate as disciplinary proceedings all three of these individuals<br />\nwould conduct themselves without impropriety.<br />\nThe appeals process under the Savitz compromise is placed in<br />\nthe lap of President Muller, which is- not altogether<br />\nunreasonable. We question the definition attached to the<br />\nPresident's \"designee\", which we suspect gives Dr. Muller the<br />\nprivilege to delegate his authority in the appeals process to<br />\nanyone he deems fit.<br />\nDespite principled objections to the concept entertained by,<br />\nany discipline code, there is apparently no broom swift enough<br />\nto keep these three paragraphs under the rug.

They want a free<br />\ngame. However, free games cannot<br />\nbe won by violence.

A lot of<br />\n'dyed-in-the-wool players won't<br />\ntouch three-ball machines as a<br />\nprotest against the manufacturers.\"<br />\n, There is more to playing pinball<br /><br />\nthan meets the eye. Mike Lenardo,<br />\na freshman, explained \"The whole<br />\nart of pinball is shaking the<br />\nmachine. Anyone who's good,<br />\nshakes. Good flipper action counts,<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\nSavitz further explained that the<br />\nobject is to light the \"special\",<br />\nwhich gives a free ball and an extra<br />\nchance to win free games.<br />\n\"Also, the plunger has markings<br />\nnext to it\" Savitz went on. \"A<br />\ngood player uses the markings to<br />\njudge how far back to pull the<br />\nplunger.

The<br />\nFords had defeated the Jays in<br />\nthe past three seasons, including<br />\nlast year's 4-1 result. The Jays,<br />\nhowever, were out for more than<br />\njust revenge, for the win was<br />\nsecond to the unification of the<br />\nteam.<br />\nIn front of a continually<br />\ngrowing crowd, the Hopkins'<br />\nbooters demonstrated the skills<br />\nand abilities that the team always<br />\nhad but could never put forth in<br />\ntheir preseason efforts. The most<br />\nimportant statistic was in the<br />\nshooting column. For once, the<br />\nJays proved that they weren't<br />\nafraid of the ball, as they put 35<br />\nshots to the goal.<br />\nSupporting this zealous<br />\nonslaught was a superb defensive<br />\neffort by the backs.
