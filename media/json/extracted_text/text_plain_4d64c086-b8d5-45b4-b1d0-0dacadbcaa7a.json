A book for general<br />\naudiences covering much of<br />\nthe same material, entitled<br />\nGhosts in the Mind's<br />\nMachine, will be published<br />\nthis summer by W.W.

Do<br />\nyou mentally picture the<br />\nstreets and count the traffic<br />\nlights?<br />\n\"Or consider how you<br />\ndecide whether a jar will fit<br />\nin a vacant spot on a shelf in<br />\nthe refrigerator, or whether<br />\na given shirt you see in a<br />\nstore will go with some pants<br />\nyou have at home, or whether<br />\nyour high school English<br />\nteacher wore glasses.<br />\n\"Mental imagery is used<br />\nnot only for such mundane<br />\nactivities, but also for the<br />\nloftiest of intellectual work.<br />\nAlbert Einstein claims to<br />\nhave gotten his first flash of<br />\ninsight about relativity theory when he imagined himself chasing after a beam of<br />\nlight, 'seeing' what would<br />\nhappen as he plunged ahead,<br />\nthen caught up with it.\"<br />\nKosslyn's goal is to understand how mental imagery<br />\nworks well enough to enable<br />\nhim to program a computer<br />\n<br />\nto have \"mental imagery.\"<br />\nHe has used the metaphor of<br />\na computer to explain his<br />\ntheory.<br />\nIn a computer, video displays can be generated using<br />\nnon-pictorial codes stored in<br />\nthe machine's memory. Kosslyn theorizes that the human brain may have a similar<br />\ncapacity with stored information being used to create<br />\nvisual displays on a \"mental<br />\nscreen.\" \u2022<br />\nThe images themselves<br />\nvary in complexity and size.<br />\nThus, if called upon, one<br />\ncould imagine a bear, whose<br />\ngeneral, abstracted image<br />\nwould fill the \"mental<br />\nscreen.\" If asked to focus on<br />\nthe bear's face, a person<br />\nshould bring that image fully into the screen and add the<br />\ndetails. The additional images would be generated<br />\nfrom a \"file\" stored in<br />\nmemory.<br />\n\"There are skeletal images<br />\nand fay developed images,\"<br />\nKosslyn says. \"The skeletal<br />\nimage, the form of the bear,<br />\ncan be held in the mind for<br />\na few seconds, whereas the<br />\nfully developed, detailed image is much more fleeting.\"<br />\nObjects in mental images<br />\nbehave as if they are threedimensional, allowing one to<br />\nexamine them in various<br />\nways, from different angles.<br />\nThe results from numerous<br />\nexperiments show that once<br />\nan image of an object has<br />\nappeared, the mind can rotate it; scan it, pan across it<br />\nor zoom in on particular<br />\ndetails.<br />\nAn individual can be<br />\nadept at some imagery operations but not others. Kosslyn's current research is<br />\naimed in part at determining<br />\nwhether different parts of<br />\nthe brain perform different<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nHis work to date suggests<br />\nthat the prevailing view that<br />\nthe right hemisphere of the<br />\nbrain is predominantly responsible for visual imagery<br />\nand abstract thought is overly simpliqic. His research indicates instead that both<br />\nhalves of the brain operate<br />\n<br />\non the image and that the<br />\nconnective bridge between<br />\nhemispheres\u2014the corpus callosum\u2014plays an important<br />\nrole in coordinating those<br />\nactivities.<br />\nHe and his colleagues<br />\nhave found that the left<br />\nhemisphere\u2014generally believed to be the one responsible for verbal or analytical<br />\nreasoning\u2014is necessary for<br />\ngenerating some kinds of<br />\nimages.<br />\nIn general, Kosslyn says,<br />\nimages serve three main purposes: remembering visible<br />\nproperties of objects or<br />\nevents that have not been<br />\nverbally encoded in the brain<br />\n(such as recalling the size of<br />\na beagle's ears); visual reasoning about spatial relationships (such as thinking<br />\nabout how to rearrange furniture without doing it); and<br />\nsymbolic, or mathematicaltype, reasoning whereby one<br />\nimagines the solution to a<br />\nproblem using symbols(such<br />\nas imagining circles within<br />\ncircles to stand for nested<br />\nsets when solving logic<br />\nproblems).<br />\nKosslyn hopes through<br />\nadditional research to understand the mechanisms that<br />\ncontrol the imagery system<br />\nin the brain, and where they<br />\nare located.<br />\nHe is scheduled to receive<br />\nthe award and a prize of<br />\n$15,000 at the 102nd meeting<br />\nof the National Academy of<br />\nSciences on Monday, April<br />\n25, in Washington.<br />\nKosslyn was an associate<br />\nprofessor of psychology at<br />\nBrandeis University before<br />\njoining the Johns Hopkins<br />\nfaculty this year.

Although the proponents<br />\nof this proposal are well-intentioned, the idea<br />\nis poorly reasoned, economically infeasible<br />\nand discriminatory towards small institutions<br />\nsuch as Johns Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nPay More, Work Harder<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nWhen Hopkins announced its $9(X) tuition<br />\nhike, many students responded with groans<br />\nof complaint. The News-Letter, however,<br />\nbelieves that complaint is unjustified. In fact,<br />\nthe tuition at Hopkins is too low; it should<br />\nbe higher.<br />\nUndergraduates at Hopkins pay only<br />\nabout one-third of the cost of their education. At most other schools, the percentage<br />\npaid by students is considerably higher.<br />\nThere is considerable merit to this. It teaches<br />\nyoungsters the value of a dollar. Students at<br />\nHopkins are bound to think that getting a<br />\nfree ride is normal in life.<br />\nBecause Hopkins is a bargain compared<br />\nto other institutions of equal caliber, many<br />\nparents choose to send their children to com-<br />\n<br />\npeting colleges where they believe their<br />\nchildren will receive a better education. They<br />\nfeel that if you pay more, you'll probably<br />\nget more out of it. There is some truth to<br />\nthat. The ratio of Hopkins dropouts to tuition increases at competing schools is approaching the 50-percent rate.<br />\nFinally, if students pay more money, they<br />\nwill want to work harder. People these days<br />\nwant to get their money's worth. The more<br />\nstudents pay for tuition, the more hours they<br />\nwill spend with their books, thus spending<br />\nless time on frivolous pursuits. So although<br />\nwe would like to see a tuition increase of<br />\nabout $1500, the News-Letter heartily endorses the administration's tuition hike.<br />\nApril Fool!<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nUndergraduates Are Granted Second Priority In Use Of Barn<br />\n^<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nlime allocation, does not offer<br />\n<br />\nAs you may or may not<br />\nknow, the Barn Theater is<br />\nlocated on the Homewood<br />\nCampus.

Murada7<br />\n<br />\nProfessor David Responds To Professor Spring<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in response to<br />\nProfessor Spring's letter of<br />\nMarch 11 in which he asserted<br />\nthat two of the main points of<br />\nmy lecture against the freeze<br />\nwere \"illogical.\"<br />\nThese points were the dangers<br />\nto deterrence if the offensive<br />\narms race were stopped while<br />\ndefensive, non-nuclear arms<br />\nwere allowed to grow unchecked<br />\n'Ind my alleged view that only<br />\nxperts have the right to speak<br />\non nuclear issues. Since Prof.<br />\nSpring did not attend my talk<br />\nand (presumably) bases his objection on the brief summary in<br />\nthe News-Letter, it would be<br />\nhelpful for me to elaborate on<br />\nthe points he finds objectionable.<br />\nFirst, a growth in defensive<br />\ncapabilities without an offensive response is dangerous to<br />\ndeterrence. Nuclear peace is<br />\nmaintained by the United States<br />\nand the Soviet Union knowing<br />\nthat nothing will be gained by<br />\nstriking the other side first since<br />\nsuch a strike would provoke a<br />\ndevastating response. This<br />\nknowledge, in turn, requires<br />\nboth sides to maintain survivable second strike forces.<br />\nUnder the freeze, offensive<br />\nweaponry would be frozen but<br />\nnon-nuclear arms which threaten<br />\nthose weapons would not.<br />\nThus, for example, we would<br />\nnot be permitted to build new<br />\naircraft or cruise missiles which<br />\n<br />\nthreaten the Soviets with unacceptable retaliation should they<br />\nstrike us, but the Soviets would<br />\nbe free to build all the antiaircraft missiles and jet interceptors they chose. This puts<br />\nthem one step closer to a disarming first strike. That we might<br />\nbe able to do the same to them<br />\nis equally frightening. By<br />\nweakening the \"balance of terror\" maintained by the U.S.<br />\nand the U.S.S.R., the freeze, I<br />\nbelieve, increases the chances of<br />\nnuclear war.<br />\nAs to the second point, I<br />\nnever argued that only experts<br />\nhave the right to speak on<br />\nnuclear issues. To the contrary,<br />\nI said I welcomed public debate<br />\non this issue, especially since it<br />\naffects everyone. What does<br />\ndisturb me is the utter confidence and moral sanctimoniousness that many groups (including Physicians for Social<br />\nResponsibility) treat this very<br />\ncomplex issue. As with cancer<br />\ntreatment, there are many ways<br />\nto approach the problem of<br />\npreventing nuclear war. Well<br />\nmeaning people can and do<br />\ndisagree. All people, experts<br />\nand non-experts alike, should<br />\nexercise a little humility in advocating solutions and condemning opponents.<br />\n1 hope this clarifies my<br />\nposition.<br />\nSincerely.,<br />\nSteven R.

C0ES<br />\n<br />\nBY DON FRITZ<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University, from the fall of 1946 to the<br />\nspring of 1950, typified a traditional and time-honored institution of higher learning. Most of<br />\nher students, fresh out of the<br />\nmilitary, were anxious to get on<br />\nwith their education. Students<br />\nin those days were content to*<br />\nallow the administration to run<br />\nthe University. The great social<br />\nand political issues would be<br />\n.waiting for us upon graduation.<br />\nSome of the Hopkins professors, in this era, possessed<br />\nsome of the finest minds in the<br />\nnation. This was a time to<br />\nstudy, learn and enjoy. During<br />\nfreshman orientation, the lore<br />\nand experiences of our predecessors on this campus were<br />\ninstilled into our eager minds.<br />\nWe attended a reception and<br />\nmet the president of the University. Members of the H Club<br />\nand seniors gave us a guided<br />\ntour. How many students today<br />\nknow the significance of those<br />\ntwo concrete-filled shafts in<br />\nfront of Gilman Hall?<br />\nAn immediate and strong<br />\nfeeling of love, devotion, and<br />\nyes, rah, rah, college spirit<br />\ndeveloped toward The Johns<br />\nHopkins University. Unbridled<br />\nadmiration resulted for athletic<br />\nteams representing the school.<br />\nThis student support, on occasion, reached perilous heights.<br />\nIncidents over that four-year<br />\nspan worth mentioning included the defense of our goal posts<br />\nfollowing the 1948 football<br />\nteam's sole defeat. This team<br />\nreceived an invitation to play in<br />\nthe Tangerine Bowl, the Hopkins first, and last, bowl invite.<br />\nPennsylvania Military College<br />\ncadets(now Widener College),<br />\nwhile in the act of tearing down<br />\nthe Homewood Field goal posts,<br />\nmet a withering counter offensive from hundreds of Hopkins<br />\nsupporters. Cadet hats, jackets<br />\nand pants flew through the air.<br />\nThe melee lasted until their<br />\nbugler (several times knocked<br />\ndown) sounded recall. The<br />\ncadets retreated to their buses.<br />\nFor years, snappy PMC hats<br />\nwere prominently displayed in<br />\nfraternity houses and dorm<br />\nrooms.<br />\nThe most humorous incident<br />\nhappened in the fall of 1950 at<br />\nWestern Maryland, a traditional and stalwart football foe.<br />\nThe game, played on their<br />\nHomecoming day, naturally included a Homecoming queen.<br />\nHopkins students, reinforced<br />\nby a cider and gin mixture, purchased en route, kidnapped the<br />\nbeauty. They held her captive in<br />\nthe Hopkins grandstands.<br />\nWestern Maryland; not to be<br />\noutdone, immediately dispatched their ROTC, armed with<br />\nwoodeni rifles, to retrieve her.<br />\nAs I recall, the Hopkins stu-<br />\n<br />\ndents released the queen, but<br />\nnot because of the ROTC. They<br />\nescorted her back in her antique<br />\ncarriage which promptly collapsed from the weight of all<br />\nthe Hopkins students. JHU<br />\nreceived a bill for its repair the<br />\nnext week.<br />\nThe most memorable exploit<br />\nof that period, without question, happened in the spring of<br />\n1947. During the build-up preceding the big lacrosse game<br />\nagainst the University of Maryland, some exuberant Hopkins<br />\nstudents lifted the 600-pound<br />\nbronze terrapin residing outside<br />\nMaryland's athletic stadium.<br />\nThe next evening, Maryland<br />\nstudents invaded the Hopkins<br />\ncampus in force, ostensibly to<br />\nfind their mascot.<br />\nThey were met, their approach to Baltimore followed<br />\nby a complex warning system,<br />\nby hundreds of Hopkins students. Intricate and formidable<br />\ndefensive measures were in<br />\nplace. The Maryland students<br />\ngrouped, then stormed the<br />\nHopkins dormitories. They<br />\nbreached the first line of defense, a barricade of hastily<br />\nstacked furniture and whatever<br />\nelse could be found not nailed<br />\ndown. Streaming into the<br />\ndorms proper, the Maryland<br />\nstudents were met by fire hoses,<br />\nsoap sudded steps, mops and<br />\nfists.<br />\nOnly the judicious intervention by the Baltimore Police<br />\nriot squad prevented any serions injuries or damage.<br />\nMeanwhile, sorpc_ Hopkins<br />\nstudents had mounted a diversion at the University of<br />\nMaryland. Probably not knowing where to attack, due to the<br />\nenormity of that campus, a few<br />\nwere captured. The next day,<br />\nwith shaven heads, they were<br />\nled by dog collars and leashes<br />\ninto classes and around the<br />\nMaryland campus.<br />\nThe Hopkins administration,<br />\nin an attempt to end this bit of<br />\ncollege revelry, threatened to<br />\nforfeit the lacrosse game if the<br />\nbronze terrapin was not returned. Painted black and blue, the<br />\nMaryland mascot, under such a<br />\nthreat, found its way back to<br />\nCollege Park.<br />\nThe, next day, as spectators<br />\nfiled into Ritchie Stadium to<br />\nwitness the game, they saw<br />\nHopkins student prisoners<br />\nscrubbing the paint off the<br />\nterrapin.<br />\nJohns Hopkins won that<br />\ngame and the first of four National Lacrosse championships<br />\nthey were to win during this<br />\nperiod.<br />\nWe had our reasons for the<br />\ndevotion shown our University.<br />\nHer greatness lies in the hearts<br />\nof her alumni who remember.<br />\nDon Fritz is a member ofthe<br />\nClass of 1950.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\n'DesAr Mom + DO- SPRIAIF- Aer.4#4 IN FLoelD4<br />\n/5<br />\n<br />\nA Stolen Terrapin<br />\nAnd Bald Slaves<br />\n<br />\nFLOilICii\\<br />\n<br />\n-7-<br />\n<br />\n..7e//5 /5<br />\n<br />\nHr w.,S A AlosT<br />\nAirF/fr-srt6-\u2022<br />\n,.., Froit)f<br />\n<br />\n7-4 yc 04.111.<br />\n<br />\nWFif6- 4Re -S941E Nal FA'/O/PS<br />\n<br />\n1(16-fit 1<br />\nAl4-DE :<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\nOil<br />\n<br />\n0g<br />\n)811<br />\nCZI<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n-TA L4m i \".<br />\n<br />\nBilbweiscRs<br />\nKtnii)1_1!'<br />\n<br />\nk b,<br />\n-1115 Is Ai y F,f/F,)<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n414<br />\n<br />\nAir<br />\nvas<br />\n<br />\n74L/'-,1r/,,ir<br />\nA./0.0 Ty<br />\n<br />\nk<br />\n<br />\nglh<br />\n<br />\nSoitity Kit), A Hp4<br />\n(. 0,./A/A 0.m.r 7-4<br />\non.ip\u2022scArc<br />\nY(''z aE..c I<br />\n<br />\ntiLIP<br />\n,,s1<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nDgmite 6,<br />\n.

This was justified because it was decided that a prudent national security policy required prior registration of that<br />\ngroup most likely to be called<br />\nupon in event of an emergency.<br />\nTo back up this policy, Congress made evasion of registration a felony punishable by up<br />\nto five years in prison and a<br />\n$10,000 fine.<br />\nNow people might not agree<br />\nthat registration is necessary<br />\nand can seek to change the law.<br />\nBut the law is on the books and<br />\nthe government is reasonably<br />\ntrying to do what all governments are expected to do\u2014<br />\nenforce the law. Therefore, it is<br />\nonly logical that Congress, having decided that registration is<br />\na fundamental civic responsibility, should try and limit<br />\nfederal subsidies to those who<br />\nbreak the law. Even Mr. Lapham must admit it is a bit<br />\nludicrous to expect the government to practice civil disobedience.<br />\nWhile it is true that, apart<br />\n<br />\nfrom job training assistance, no<br />\nsuch limitations have been placed on other government programs and while it is also true<br />\nthat wealthy students will not<br />\nbe affected by these restrictions, saying that Congress<br />\ncould theoretically do more is<br />\nnot the same as saying that<br />\nwhat it has already done is<br />\nwrong.<br />\nAs for the University, I<br />\nwould find it deeply repugnant<br />\nif some type of substitute aid<br />\nwas offered. With resources as<br />\nscarce as they are, how could<br />\nthe University justify shifting<br />\nresources from those who have<br />\ncomplied with the law to those<br />\nwho have not? Why offer aid to<br />\nstudents who are not willing to<br />\naccept the minimum requirements of citizenship?<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n..1--o rr 0 r r--c)(A.J IS<br />\n<br />\n-1-kle_ hi3 olaj I<br />\nen /<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\nlik<br />\n<br />\nYours also in peace,<br />\nGuy Wiggins<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nA I-1-c, -file 1 .1--c_ ke /y1 y brarh c)c,c-f<br />\n741-ie y re rYik,,-,5 rn e a.

The resulting friction between frivolity and sardonicism created<br />\nmusic no less noteworthy for its derivativeness. This is the formula Crenshaw<br />\nadopted for his first album last spring,<br />\nand one that Lowe has unfortunately<br />\nabandoned. Beginning with last year's<br />\nNick the Knife, Lowe's lyrical insight<br />\nbegan to dull, resulting in songs that<br />\nwere hummable without being memorable. The trend continues with The<br />\nAbominable Showman.<br />\nThe new album abounds in silly,<br />\n<br />\nalbum.<br />\nLowe strikes an adversar) pose on the co\u2018,er of his latest<br />\n<br />\nhedonistic and/or romantic rhymes<br />\nredeemed only occasionally by fresh, exciting melodies. The overall effect is one<br />\nof stagnation: you keep rooting for<br />\nLowe to break out of his rut, and when<br />\nhe doesn't, you conclude either that he's<br />\ntaken the easy way out, or that he just<br />\ndoesn't have it anymore.(The contents<br />\nof the album last barely more than a half<br />\nhour.)<br />\nSide one opens with \"We Want Action,\" a moderate pub-rocker featuring<br />\nstandard Lowe couplets like \"We want<br />\naction/We're looking for a bit of<br />\nfeminine distraction.\" \"Raging Eyes,\"<br />\nthe next cut, is perhaps the best on the<br />\nalbum, because it does what this sort of<br />\n\u2022pop does best: creates an intriguing sexual image (how the hell do eyes rage,<br />\nanyway?)over a striking, upbeat melody<br />\nand rhythm. This is the kind of song<br />\nLowe's previous band, Rockpile, kept<br />\nas its stock in trade. \"Cool Reaction\"<br />\nis a basic lament(\"All I want is satisfaction/All I get's a cool reaction\") set to<br />\na mock-reggae beat. \"Time Wounds All<br />\n.Heels\" and \"(For Every. Woman Who<br />\nEver Made a Fool of a Man There's a<br />\nWoman Made a) Man of a Fool\"(1) are<br />\npleasant enough, and the side ends with<br />\n\"Tanque-Rae,\" the sound of which can<br />\nbest be described as the Beach Boys on<br />\nQuaaludes.<br />\nThe second side fares much more<br />\npoorly. \"Wish You Were Here\" is a<br />\nduet between Lowe and Paul Carrack,<br />\nwhose vocal talents are largely wasted<br />\non lame lyrics like \"You're okay/You're<br />\nall right/Don't have to be blind to know<br />\nthat you're out of sight/And having said<br />\nthat, my dear/How I wish that you were<br />\nhere.\" \"Paid the Price,\" the third track,<br />\nis a strings-sodden weeper; \"Mess<br />\nAround With Love\" is worth mentioning if only for Carrack's gruff pianopounding. \"Saint Beneath the Paint\"<br />\n<br />\ncontains some interesting ideas but is<br />\nbogged down by a melody that sounds<br />\nlike it was written for Mickey Dolenz.<br />\nThe album closes with an embarrassing<br />\ntune called \"How Do You Talk to an<br />\nAngel,\" and it's every bit as bad as its<br />\ntitle implies. Modern pop songwriters<br />\nlike Billy Joel, Glenn Tilbrook and Elvis<br />\nCostello usually justify writing such<br />\nsongs by claiming a wish that Frank<br />\nSinatra would record them; Lowe here<br />\nseems to have in mind someone more<br />\nlike Nat \"King\" Cole, or even Eddie<br />\nCantor.<br />\nThe production, by Roger Bechirian<br />\nand Lowe, is consistently interesting,<br />\nand the musicians (Lowe on bass and<br />\nguitar and the aforementioned Carrack<br />\non keyboards, bassist James Eller,<br />\ndrummer Bobby Irwin and guitarist<br />\nMartin Belmont) handle the material<br />\nadeptly. But it is the writing that renders<br />\nThe Abominable Showman tepid and<br />\ninconsequential. While Lowe has been<br />\nresponsible for some of the most<br />\nenergetic songs of the past few years<br />\n(remember \"Cruel to Be Kind\"?), it<br />\nseems he's now having trouble producing even marginally passable bubblegum music.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14/APRIL ,1,) 1983<br />\n<br />\nFILM<br />\n<br />\nMutiny on the 'Bounty (Reel<br />\nWorld, Shriver Hall): With<br />\nCharles Laughton and Clark<br />\nGable.

Montreal\u2014The Expos are<br />\nthe best team in baseball. The<br />\nExpos are well-balanced; they<br />\ncan hit, pitch, run and field<br />\nwell. Only the Dodgers had better pitching statistics last year.<br />\nThis year the Expos should be<br />\neven better with Bill Gullickson,<br />\nScott Sanderson and Ray Burris<br />\ncoming off sub-par seasons. The<br />\nbullpen is solid with perhaps the<br />\nmost underrated player in the<br />\nmajor leagues, Jeff Reardon.<br />\nSince joining the Expos in 1981<br />\nhis ERA has averaged 1.85 (the<br />\ncomputer that ranks free agents<br />\nrated him higher than Bruce<br />\nSutter, Rollie Fingers and Rich<br />\n(iossage.) The rest of the Montreal team is stocked with solid<br />\nall-around players. Arguably,<br />\nthe Expos have the majors' best<br />\ncatcher, center fielder and base<br />\nstealer in Gary Carter, Andre<br />\nDawson and Tim Raines.

His single \"Cynical<br />\nGirl\" is particularly similar to<br />\nHolly's style.<br />\nThe comparison to the Beatles obviously stems at least in<br />\npart from Crenshaw's stint in<br />\nthe film Beatlemania. Playing<br />\nJohn Lennon, he was with the<br />\nshow for about two years. In<br />\nearly 1980, however, Crenshaw<br />\ndecided to strike out on his<br />\nown.<br />\nIn New York, he formed a<br />\nband with his brother Robert<br />\non drums and Chris Donato on<br />\nbass. Building on his success,<br />\nCrenshaw eventually signed a<br />\ncontract with Warner Brothers<br />\nand released his first album,<br />\nMarshall Crenshaw.<br />\nStill working with his original<br />\ntrio, Crenshaw plans to release<br />\nhis second album in May.

Hopkins'<br />\nBudget Director Edward Meerholz said that the University<br />\nhad originally considered a 10<br />\npercent increase, but under<br />\npressure from the deans and<br />\nfaculty, the higher figure was<br />\nadopted.<br />\nSpecial Assistant to the President Jakie Hall said that \"over<br />\nthe year, faculty salaries have<br />\nnot been keeping pace\" with<br />\nthe cost of living.<br />\nThe faculty is concerned that<br />\nunless salaries at Hopkins are<br />\ncomparable to other universities, the school will be unable<br />\nto attract and keep prestigious<br />\nscholars. The deans \"pushed<br />\nfor a higher It<br />\nincrease\"<br />\nto make the University more<br />\ncompetitive, says Meerholz.<br /><br />\nAccording to an American<br />\nAssociation of University Professors' study, Hopkins had the<br />\neight highest professorial salaries in 1981-82. Hopkins pays<br />\nan average $43,100 to full professors. This figure applies to<br />\nall University divisions. Salaries<br />\nfor Homewood alone were not<br />\navailable. The highest paying<br />\nuniversity was Rockefeller in<br />\nNew York, which paid more<br />\n[halt $50,000.

A book for general<br />\naudiences covering much of<br />\nthe same material, entitled<br />\nGhosts in the Mind's<br />\nMachine, will be published<br />\nthis summer by W.W. Norton.<br />\n\"Most people construct<br />\nand use mental images every<br />\nday,\" Kosslyn says. \"Consider what goes on in your<br />\nmind when you are stopped<br />\nby a tourist and asked how<br />\nto get to the train station. Do<br />\nyou mentally picture the<br />\nstreets and count the traffic<br />\nlights?<br />\n\"Or consider how you<br />\ndecide whether a jar will fit<br />\nin a vacant spot on a shelf in<br />\nthe refrigerator, or whether<br />\na given shirt you see in a<br />\nstore will go with some pants<br />\nyou have at home, or whether<br />\nyour high school English<br />\nteacher wore glasses.<br />\n\"Mental imagery is used<br />\nnot only for such mundane<br />\nactivities, but also for the<br />\nloftiest of intellectual work.<br />\nAlbert Einstein claims to<br />\nhave gotten his first flash of<br />\ninsight about relativity theory when he imagined himself chasing after a beam of<br />\nlight, 'seeing' what would<br />\nhappen as he plunged ahead,<br />\nthen caught up with it.\"<br />\nKosslyn's goal is to understand how mental imagery<br />\nworks well enough to enable<br />\nhim to program a computer<br /><br />\nto have \"mental imagery.\"<br />\nHe has used the metaphor of<br />\na computer to explain his<br />\ntheory.<br />\nIn a computer, video displays can be generated using<br />\nnon-pictorial codes stored in<br />\nthe machine's memory. Kosslyn theorizes that the human brain may have a similar<br />\ncapacity with stored information being used to create<br />\nvisual displays on a \"mental<br />\nscreen.\" \u2022<br />\nThe images themselves<br />\nvary in complexity and size.<br />\nThus, if called upon, one<br />\ncould imagine a bear, whose<br />\ngeneral, abstracted image<br />\nwould fill the \"mental<br />\nscreen.\" If asked to focus on<br />\nthe bear's face, a person<br />\nshould bring that image fully into the screen and add the<br />\ndetails.

Although the proponents<br />\nof this proposal are well-intentioned, the idea<br />\nis poorly reasoned, economically infeasible<br />\nand discriminatory towards small institutions<br />\nsuch as Johns Hopkins.<br /><br />\nPay More, Work Harder<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nWhen Hopkins announced its $9(X) tuition<br />\nhike, many students responded with groans<br />\nof complaint. The News-Letter, however,<br />\nbelieves that complaint is unjustified. In fact,<br />\nthe tuition at Hopkins is too low; it should<br />\nbe higher.<br />\nUndergraduates at Hopkins pay only<br />\nabout one-third of the cost of their education. At most other schools, the percentage<br />\npaid by students is considerably higher.<br />\nThere is considerable merit to this. It teaches<br />\nyoungsters the value of a dollar. Students at<br />\nHopkins are bound to think that getting a<br />\nfree ride is normal in life.<br />\nBecause Hopkins is a bargain compared<br />\nto other institutions of equal caliber, many<br />\nparents choose to send their children to com-<br /><br />\npeting colleges where they believe their<br />\nchildren will receive a better education. They<br />\nfeel that if you pay more, you'll probably<br />\nget more out of it. There is some truth to<br />\nthat. The ratio of Hopkins dropouts to tuition increases at competing schools is approaching the 50-percent rate.<br />\nFinally, if students pay more money, they<br />\nwill want to work harder. People these days<br />\nwant to get their money's worth. The more<br />\nstudents pay for tuition, the more hours they<br />\nwill spend with their books, thus spending<br />\nless time on frivolous pursuits. So although<br />\nwe would like to see a tuition increase of<br />\nabout $1500, the News-Letter heartily endorses the administration's tuition hike.<br />\nApril Fool!<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nUndergraduates Are Granted Second Priority In Use Of Barn<br />\n^<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nlime allocation, does not offer<br /><br />\nAs you may or may not<br />\nknow, the Barn Theater is<br />\nlocated on the Homewood<br />\nCampus.

Murada7<br /><br />\nProfessor David Responds To Professor Spring<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in response to<br />\nProfessor Spring's letter of<br />\nMarch 11 in which he asserted<br />\nthat two of the main points of<br />\nmy lecture against the freeze<br />\nwere \"illogical.\"<br />\nThese points were the dangers<br />\nto deterrence if the offensive<br />\narms race were stopped while<br />\ndefensive, non-nuclear arms<br />\nwere allowed to grow unchecked<br />\n'Ind my alleged view that only<br />\nxperts have the right to speak<br />\non nuclear issues. Since Prof.<br />\nSpring did not attend my talk<br />\nand (presumably) bases his objection on the brief summary in<br />\nthe News-Letter, it would be<br />\nhelpful for me to elaborate on<br />\nthe points he finds objectionable.<br />\nFirst, a growth in defensive<br />\ncapabilities without an offensive response is dangerous to<br />\ndeterrence. Nuclear peace is<br />\nmaintained by the United States<br />\nand the Soviet Union knowing<br />\nthat nothing will be gained by<br />\nstriking the other side first since<br />\nsuch a strike would provoke a<br />\ndevastating response. This<br />\nknowledge, in turn, requires<br />\nboth sides to maintain survivable second strike forces.<br />\nUnder the freeze, offensive<br />\nweaponry would be frozen but<br />\nnon-nuclear arms which threaten<br />\nthose weapons would not.<br />\nThus, for example, we would<br />\nnot be permitted to build new<br />\naircraft or cruise missiles which<br /><br />\nthreaten the Soviets with unacceptable retaliation should they<br />\nstrike us, but the Soviets would<br />\nbe free to build all the antiaircraft missiles and jet interceptors they chose. This puts<br />\nthem one step closer to a disarming first strike. That we might<br />\nbe able to do the same to them<br />\nis equally frightening. By<br />\nweakening the \"balance of terror\" maintained by the U.S.<br />\nand the U.S.S.R., the freeze, I<br />\nbelieve, increases the chances of<br />\nnuclear war.<br />\nAs to the second point, I<br />\nnever argued that only experts<br />\nhave the right to speak on<br />\nnuclear issues. To the contrary,<br />\nI said I welcomed public debate<br />\non this issue, especially since it<br />\naffects everyone. What does<br />\ndisturb me is the utter confidence and moral sanctimoniousness that many groups (including Physicians for Social<br />\nResponsibility) treat this very<br />\ncomplex issue. As with cancer<br />\ntreatment, there are many ways<br />\nto approach the problem of<br />\npreventing nuclear war. Well<br />\nmeaning people can and do<br />\ndisagree. All people, experts<br />\nand non-experts alike, should<br />\nexercise a little humility in advocating solutions and condemning opponents.<br />\n1 hope this clarifies my<br />\nposition.<br />\nSincerely.,<br />\nSteven R.

C0ES<br /><br />\nBY DON FRITZ<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University, from the fall of 1946 to the<br />\nspring of 1950, typified a traditional and time-honored institution of higher learning. Most of<br />\nher students, fresh out of the<br />\nmilitary, were anxious to get on<br />\nwith their education. Students<br />\nin those days were content to*<br />\nallow the administration to run<br />\nthe University. The great social<br />\nand political issues would be<br />\n.waiting for us upon graduation.<br />\nSome of the Hopkins professors, in this era, possessed<br />\nsome of the finest minds in the<br />\nnation. This was a time to<br />\nstudy, learn and enjoy. During<br />\nfreshman orientation, the lore<br />\nand experiences of our predecessors on this campus were<br />\ninstilled into our eager minds.<br />\nWe attended a reception and<br />\nmet the president of the University. Members of the H Club<br />\nand seniors gave us a guided<br />\ntour. How many students today<br />\nknow the significance of those<br />\ntwo concrete-filled shafts in<br />\nfront of Gilman Hall?<br />\nAn immediate and strong<br />\nfeeling of love, devotion, and<br />\nyes, rah, rah, college spirit<br />\ndeveloped toward The Johns<br />\nHopkins University. Unbridled<br />\nadmiration resulted for athletic<br />\nteams representing the school.<br />\nThis student support, on occasion, reached perilous heights.<br />\nIncidents over that four-year<br />\nspan worth mentioning included the defense of our goal posts<br />\nfollowing the 1948 football<br />\nteam's sole defeat. This team<br />\nreceived an invitation to play in<br />\nthe Tangerine Bowl, the Hopkins first, and last, bowl invite.<br />\nPennsylvania Military College<br />\ncadets(now Widener College),<br />\nwhile in the act of tearing down<br />\nthe Homewood Field goal posts,<br />\nmet a withering counter offensive from hundreds of Hopkins<br />\nsupporters. Cadet hats, jackets<br />\nand pants flew through the air.<br />\nThe melee lasted until their<br />\nbugler (several times knocked<br />\ndown) sounded recall. The<br />\ncadets retreated to their buses.<br />\nFor years, snappy PMC hats<br />\nwere prominently displayed in<br />\nfraternity houses and dorm<br />\nrooms.<br />\nThe most humorous incident<br />\nhappened in the fall of 1950 at<br />\nWestern Maryland, a traditional and stalwart football foe.<br />\nThe game, played on their<br />\nHomecoming day, naturally included a Homecoming queen.<br />\nHopkins students, reinforced<br />\nby a cider and gin mixture, purchased en route, kidnapped the<br />\nbeauty. They held her captive in<br />\nthe Hopkins grandstands.<br />\nWestern Maryland; not to be<br />\noutdone, immediately dispatched their ROTC, armed with<br />\nwoodeni rifles, to retrieve her.<br />\nAs I recall, the Hopkins stu-<br /><br />\ndents released the queen, but<br />\nnot because of the ROTC. They<br />\nescorted her back in her antique<br />\ncarriage which promptly collapsed from the weight of all<br />\nthe Hopkins students. JHU<br />\nreceived a bill for its repair the<br />\nnext week.<br />\nThe most memorable exploit<br />\nof that period, without question, happened in the spring of<br />\n1947. During the build-up preceding the big lacrosse game<br />\nagainst the University of Maryland, some exuberant Hopkins<br />\nstudents lifted the 600-pound<br />\nbronze terrapin residing outside<br />\nMaryland's athletic stadium.<br />\nThe next evening, Maryland<br />\nstudents invaded the Hopkins<br />\ncampus in force, ostensibly to<br />\nfind their mascot.<br />\nThey were met, their approach to Baltimore followed<br />\nby a complex warning system,<br />\nby hundreds of Hopkins students. Intricate and formidable<br />\ndefensive measures were in<br />\nplace. The Maryland students<br />\ngrouped, then stormed the<br />\nHopkins dormitories. They<br />\nbreached the first line of defense, a barricade of hastily<br />\nstacked furniture and whatever<br />\nelse could be found not nailed<br />\ndown. Streaming into the<br />\ndorms proper, the Maryland<br />\nstudents were met by fire hoses,<br />\nsoap sudded steps, mops and<br />\nfists.<br />\nOnly the judicious intervention by the Baltimore Police<br />\nriot squad prevented any serions injuries or damage.<br />\nMeanwhile, sorpc_ Hopkins<br />\nstudents had mounted a diversion at the University of<br />\nMaryland. Probably not knowing where to attack, due to the<br />\nenormity of that campus, a few<br />\nwere captured.

This was justified because it was decided that a prudent national security policy required prior registration of that<br />\ngroup most likely to be called<br />\nupon in event of an emergency.<br />\nTo back up this policy, Congress made evasion of registration a felony punishable by up<br />\nto five years in prison and a<br />\n$10,000 fine.<br />\nNow people might not agree<br />\nthat registration is necessary<br />\nand can seek to change the law.<br />\nBut the law is on the books and<br />\nthe government is reasonably<br />\ntrying to do what all governments are expected to do\u2014<br />\nenforce the law. Therefore, it is<br />\nonly logical that Congress, having decided that registration is<br />\na fundamental civic responsibility, should try and limit<br />\nfederal subsidies to those who<br />\nbreak the law. Even Mr. Lapham must admit it is a bit<br />\nludicrous to expect the government to practice civil disobedience.<br />\nWhile it is true that, apart<br /><br />\nfrom job training assistance, no<br />\nsuch limitations have been placed on other government programs and while it is also true<br />\nthat wealthy students will not<br />\nbe affected by these restrictions, saying that Congress<br />\ncould theoretically do more is<br />\nnot the same as saying that<br />\nwhat it has already done is<br />\nwrong.<br />\nAs for the University, I<br />\nwould find it deeply repugnant<br />\nif some type of substitute aid<br />\nwas offered. With resources as<br />\nscarce as they are, how could<br />\nthe University justify shifting<br />\nresources from those who have<br />\ncomplied with the law to those<br />\nwho have not? Why offer aid to<br />\nstudents who are not willing to<br />\naccept the minimum requirements of citizenship?<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\n..1--o rr 0 r r--c)(A.J IS<br /><br />\n-1-kle_ hi3 olaj I<br />\nen /<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nis<br /><br />\nlik<br /><br />\nYours also in peace,<br />\nGuy Wiggins<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nA I-1-c, -file 1 .1--c_ ke /y1 y brarh c)c,c-f<br />\n741-ie y re rYik,,-,5 rn e a.

In a move reminiscent of<br />\nalways smacking of the Rice/Webber bably the strongest character in the many American first ladies, Eva sets out<br /><br />\non a goodwill campaign throughout<br />\nEurope, known as the Rainbow Tour.<br />\n(At one point Eva becomes disgusted<br />\nwith England's lack of proper hospitality and declares, \"If England can do<br />\nwithout me, then Argentina can do<br />\nwithout England.\" One can only<br />\nwonder how well these words were<br />\nreceived in London's West End during<br />\nthe Falklands crisis.)<br />\nBack home, the country is quickly<br />\ndeteriorating. Eva sets up her Social Aid<br />\nFoundation, a scam from which only a<br />\nfew, including Eva herself, actually<br />\nbenefit, but which sets Eva up as a saint<br />\nin the eyes of her countrymen, with the<br />\nexceptions of the military and the<br />\ndwindling aristocracy. Eventually, Eva's<br />\nwish to become vice president is<br />\ndestroyed by her failing health. She dies<br />\nof cancer in 1952 at the age of 33.<br />\nIt's fairly difficult to think of any real<br />\nshortcomings associated with this performance.

The resulting friction between frivolity and sardonicism created<br />\nmusic no less noteworthy for its derivativeness. This is the formula Crenshaw<br />\nadopted for his first album last spring,<br />\nand one that Lowe has unfortunately<br />\nabandoned. Beginning with last year's<br />\nNick the Knife, Lowe's lyrical insight<br />\nbegan to dull, resulting in songs that<br />\nwere hummable without being memorable. The trend continues with The<br />\nAbominable Showman.<br />\nThe new album abounds in silly,<br /><br />\nalbum.<br />\nLowe strikes an adversar) pose on the co\u2018,er of his latest<br /><br />\nhedonistic and/or romantic rhymes<br />\nredeemed only occasionally by fresh, exciting melodies. The overall effect is one<br />\nof stagnation: you keep rooting for<br />\nLowe to break out of his rut, and when<br />\nhe doesn't, you conclude either that he's<br />\ntaken the easy way out, or that he just<br />\ndoesn't have it anymore.(The contents<br />\nof the album last barely more than a half<br />\nhour.)<br />\nSide one opens with \"We Want Action,\" a moderate pub-rocker featuring<br />\nstandard Lowe couplets like \"We want<br />\naction/We're looking for a bit of<br />\nfeminine distraction.\" \"Raging Eyes,\"<br />\nthe next cut, is perhaps the best on the<br />\nalbum, because it does what this sort of<br />\n\u2022pop does best: creates an intriguing sexual image (how the hell do eyes rage,<br />\nanyway?)over a striking, upbeat melody<br />\nand rhythm. This is the kind of song<br />\nLowe's previous band, Rockpile, kept<br />\nas its stock in trade. \"Cool Reaction\"<br />\nis a basic lament(\"All I want is satisfaction/All I get's a cool reaction\") set to<br />\na mock-reggae beat. \"Time Wounds All<br />\n.Heels\" and \"(For Every. Woman Who<br />\nEver Made a Fool of a Man There's a<br />\nWoman Made a) Man of a Fool\"(1) are<br />\npleasant enough, and the side ends with<br />\n\"Tanque-Rae,\" the sound of which can<br />\nbest be described as the Beach Boys on<br />\nQuaaludes.<br />\nThe second side fares much more<br />\npoorly. \"Wish You Were Here\" is a<br />\nduet between Lowe and Paul Carrack,<br />\nwhose vocal talents are largely wasted<br />\non lame lyrics like \"You're okay/You're<br />\nall right/Don't have to be blind to know<br />\nthat you're out of sight/And having said<br />\nthat, my dear/How I wish that you were<br />\nhere.\" \"Paid the Price,\" the third track,<br />\nis a strings-sodden weeper; \"Mess<br />\nAround With Love\" is worth mentioning if only for Carrack's gruff pianopounding. \"Saint Beneath the Paint\"<br /><br />\ncontains some interesting ideas but is<br />\nbogged down by a melody that sounds<br />\nlike it was written for Mickey Dolenz.<br />\nThe album closes with an embarrassing<br />\ntune called \"How Do You Talk to an<br />\nAngel,\" and it's every bit as bad as its<br />\ntitle implies. Modern pop songwriters<br />\nlike Billy Joel, Glenn Tilbrook and Elvis<br />\nCostello usually justify writing such<br />\nsongs by claiming a wish that Frank<br />\nSinatra would record them; Lowe here<br />\nseems to have in mind someone more<br />\nlike Nat \"King\" Cole, or even Eddie<br />\nCantor.<br />\nThe production, by Roger Bechirian<br />\nand Lowe, is consistently interesting,<br />\nand the musicians (Lowe on bass and<br />\nguitar and the aforementioned Carrack<br />\non keyboards, bassist James Eller,<br />\ndrummer Bobby Irwin and guitarist<br />\nMartin Belmont) handle the material<br />\nadeptly. But it is the writing that renders<br />\nThe Abominable Showman tepid and<br />\ninconsequential. While Lowe has been<br />\nresponsible for some of the most<br />\nenergetic songs of the past few years<br />\n(remember \"Cruel to Be Kind\"?), it<br />\nseems he's now having trouble producing even marginally passable bubblegum music.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14/APRIL ,1,) 1983<br /><br />\nFILM<br /><br />\nMutiny on the 'Bounty (Reel<br />\nWorld, Shriver Hall): With<br />\nCharles Laughton and Clark<br />\nGable.
