Fitzpatrick reported,<br />\n\"This is not a complete solution<br />\nto our housing problems, but it is<br />\none step that can help.\"<br />\nHe added, \"Neither institution<br />\nhas made a definite committment<br />\nto do it. We're just trying to see<br />\nif there is sufficient student<br />\ninterest.\"<br />\nStudent reaction at Johns<br />\nHopkins has been largely<br />\nfavorable. Andrew Loftus,<br />\nChairman of the Student<br />\nCouncil's Housing Committee,<br />\nstated, \"I think it's a fantastic<br />\n<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick<br />\nidea.\"<br />\nDespite prohibitions which<br />\npermit only 25 Goucher seniors<br />\nto live off-campus, Goucher Dean<br />\nof Students Martha Nichols<br />\nnoted a number of dormitory<br />\nvacancies this year. \"This is not<br />\njust a case of tilling space,\" she<br />\nadded.<br />\nIn order for the plan to work,<br />\nNichols stated, \"We need at least<br />\n25 students. We can guarantee<br />\nspace for 50 men, but anything<br />\nunder 25 would be nearly<br />\ntokenism.\"<br />\nShe indicated that additional<br />\nspace, if needed, could be<br />\nobtained by allowing students to<br />\nlive off-campus.<br />\nNo plans to allow Goucher<br />\n<br />\nwomen to live at Hopkins have<br />\nbeen disclosed. Echoing criticism<br />\nfrom some Goucher<br />\nundergraduates, Loftus<br />\nsuggested, \"I feel that they<br />\nshould give all Goucher girls the<br />\noption of moving off-campus.\"<br />\nIroned<br />\nAmong difficulties which<br />\nwould have to be ironed out<br />\nbefore the plan could get<br />\nunderway, according to Hopkins<br />\nDirector of Student Affairs<br />\nDottie Lebo, are liberalized rules<br />\nfor exchange courses,<br />\ntransportation, and room and<br />\nboard rates.<br />\nAt present, students at either<br />\nschool must obtain permission<br />\nfrom both schools to enroll in a<br />\nmaximum of one course per<br />\nsemester at the other institution.<br />\nAdditional enrollment<br />\nopportunities might be necessary<br />\nunder the new plan, Lebo<br />\nindicated.<br />\nAlthough a shuttle bus runs<br />\nthe seven-mile route between the<br />\ntwo campuses hourly until<br />\n6:00p.m., Fitzpatrick stated that<br />\nlater runs would be necessary.<br />\nAnother problem is room and<br />\nboard. All dormitory students at<br />\nGoucher must presently sign up<br />\nfor meals, which are included in<br />\nthe $1550 room and board rate.<br />\n<br />\nGoucher students must pay an<br />\nadditional $100 for the January<br />\nsession. Two such sessions are<br />\nrequired for graduation.<br />\nThe current rate for room and<br />\nboard at Hopkins is $1375 for a<br />\ndouble room, and $1475 for a<br />\nsingle. There is no additional<br />\ncharge for the January session.<br />\nUpperclassmen are not required<br />\nto pay the board fee of<br />\napproximatley $5 30.<br />\nLoftus suggested that students<br />\nwould be willing to pay the<br />\nGoucher board rate, because<br />\n\"Their food seems somewhat<br />\nbetter than ours.\"<br />\n'Jerry Van Voorhis, assistant to<br />\nHopkins head resident counselor<br />\nCol. Robert Serena, reported that<br />\nadditional difficulties would<br />\ninvolve physical facilities and<br />\nsocial pressures. \"While there<br />\nhave been almost no problems<br />\nwith women adjusting to<br />\ncoeducational housing at the<br />\nUniversity.

Last<br />\nnight, I spent some time with a friend<br />\nwho told me that the Student Council is<br />\ntoo \"personalized\" because four or five<br />\npeople ARE DOING MOST OF THE<br />\nWORK. I was told that I should spend my<br />\ntime trying to \"institutionalize\" student<br />\npower so that when this year's Council<br />\nretired, the next would have their<br />\n\"power': established.<br />\nThis is a great idea. There is nothing I<br />\nwould like better than some sort of<br />\nUniversity \"Great Book\" saying that<br />\nstudents can take votes to decide this and<br />\nthat. Fat chance. Right now<br />\nundergraduates are getting informed of<br />\ndecisions after the fact. This was fairly<br />\napparent in the tuition raise.<br />\nWhat can be done to get an effective<br />\nStudent Voice at Hopkins? It is here that<br />\n\u2022 I feel Student Council members can be<br />\nmost effective. Many times, when trying<br />\nto get in to see somebody, the words<br />\n\"I'm on Student Council\" work wonder.<br />\nPeople suddenly return from lunch and<br />\nare ready and eager to listen. (This isn't<br />\nalways the case.) When talking to people I<br />\ndon't even bother to give my name any<br />\nmore, I just say that I'm President of the<br />\nStudent Council and presto! it's instant<br />\nappointment, meeting - and sometimes<br />\naction.<br />\nThe problem with Student Councils in<br />\nthe past is that the only time<br />\ncommittment that was made was during<br />\nthe meetings. The members of this year's<br />\nCouncil are doing their work during the<br />\nweek. No decision will ever be actually<br />\nmade concerning any important<br />\nUniversity policy at a Student Council<br />\nmeeting. The decisions are made in<br />\nGarland Hall (and other places) during<br />\nthe week. We just make sure apt we're<br />\nthere when those decisions are being<br />\nformulated and actually made.<br />\nWhat we try to do at meetings is decide<br />\nhow we and the undergraduates feel<br />\nabout cetain things. We try to divide up<br />\nthe labor. Nobody can be an expert on<br />\neverything. Some members work on<br />\nhousing, others on the Honor<br />\nCommission. Some members deal with<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, others are into<br />\nsheer academic problems.

For the film is<br />\nat once the most.complex and the least<br />\nabstract of the creative arts. It is also the<br />\nmost social and technological of art<br />\nforms.

And in doing so he<br />\nwas able to obtain total control of his<br />\nfilms. (His worst films were the ones<br />\nwhere this control was infringed upon.)<br />\nIn this way he was able to combine the<br />\n,talents of great scenarists (Robert Riskin,<br />\nSidney Buchman), great photographers<br />\n(Joseph Walker.

It may never get to the point<br />\nwhere they're soliciting your advice but<br />\nsoon it almost seems natural to ask the<br />\nundergraduates what they think about<br />\nthings.<br />\nSo the Student Council will continue<br />\nto operate the way they have been this<br />\nyear. As individual students who spend<br />\nsome time during the week talking and<br />\nproposing ideas to people who can put<br />\nthese ideas into use. The meeting may not<br />\nbe too exciting and Student Council<br />\nmembers may not get too much publicity<br />\nabout what they are doing. but it's<br />\ngetting done.

In one of Gilman's letters from<br />\noverseas, he records a serious observation<br />\nOven him by a professor at the University<br />\nat Freiburg, Baden:<br />\n<br />\n1 hope the trustees will not<br />\nbe scandalized by their<br />\nmathematical professor having composed a poem of<br />\n201 lines, all (except five)<br />\nrhyming to \"Rosalind.\"<br />\n<br />\nHere also are Gilman's letters from the<br />\nBritish Isles and the continent where he<br />\nwas sent in the summer of 1875 to collect<br />\nideas. Travelling with the first of his<br />\nchoices for the original faculty, Henry<br />\nRowland, he found most of the<br />\nuniversities there to be out of session,<br />\nmost of the professors to be on vacation,<br />\nand his own project to be \"making less<br />\nprogress than I could wish.\" He was,<br />\nhowever, deeply impressed, expecially by<br />\nthe German institutions and did manage<br />\nto get a broad impression of the steps he<br />\nwould take in structuring an American<br />\nuniversity in the European style. It meant<br />\nsteering away from strictly career oriented<br />\neducation toward open-ended research,<br />\nand collecting a faculty deserving of the<br />\nopportunity to escape the then narrow<br />\nlimits of American higher education.<br />\nHere, too, are the letters between<br />\nGilamn and the original faculty members,<br />\nsuch as J.

Robinson had<br />\nbeen an All-American football<br />\nplayer at U.C.L.A. before signing<br />\nwith the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br />\nAfter only one year with the<br />\nMontreal Royals in which he led<br />\nthe International League in<br />\nbatting average amd stolen bases,<br />\nhe was brought up to Brooklyn<br />\nat the age of twenty seven.<br />\nFighting, clawing and scratching<br />\nin an environment hostile, racist,<br />\nand at first unwilling to accept<br />\nhim, he won victory after victory<br />\n<br />\nfor himself and his people.<br />\nRobinson batted .297 his first<br />\nyear in the majors, led the<br />\nNational League in stolen bases<br />\nwith twenty nine, and was named<br />\nrookie of the year. Two years<br />\nlater, he won the Most Valuable<br />\nPlayer award while leading the<br />\nleague in batting (.342) and<br />\nstolen bases again (thirty seven).<br />\nThat same season he drove. in 124<br />\nruns while compiling a<br />\nremarkable 303 hits.<br />\nBut aside from this and his<br />\noutstanding lifetime average of<br />\n.311 - Robinson was one of the<br />\ngreat clutch players of his era.<br />\nTime after endless time he came<br />\n<br />\nNan-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nSpORTS<br />\nJay footballers to<br />\nseek winning track<br />\nThe Hopkin's varsity football<br />\nteam will attempt to get back on<br />\nthe winning track tomorrow at<br />\nSwarthmore, as they battle the<br />\nwinless Swarthmore Garnet.<br />\nSince Hopkins has shown a knack<br />\nfor losing to winless teams,<br />\nnothing will be certain until the<br />\nfinal whistle has sounded.<br />\nFor the most part,<br />\nSwarthmore's losses this year<br />\nhave been close games.<br />\nSwarthmore has good talent in<br />\naddition to the best wide receiver<br />\nin the conference, though the<br />\nteam as a whole does suffer from<br />\na definite lack of depth (only 25<br />\nmen on the team).<br />\nAs a result of this shortage of<br />\nmen, the barnets do tire in the<br />\nsecond half and make mistakes.<br />\nThese mistakes usually take the<br />\nform of big plays, long runs, deep<br />\npass completion or punt return<br />\nfor a touchdown.<br />\nCox is looking for a big game<br />\nfrom the entire team after the<br />\nTowson debacle, but looks for<br />\nJack Thomas and Billy NOlan to<br />\nlead fie way on offense. On<br />\ndefense, Gunter Glocker and<br />\nCraig Stevens must play well to<br />\nensure that Swarthmore does not<br />\nput many points on the<br />\nscoreboard.<br />\nRon Hall will continue to start<br />\nat defensive end with Bruce<br />\nJackson, Deith Krantz, and Mike<br />\nKrantz, and Mike O'Brien filling<br />\nout the defensive line. Joining<br />\nGlocker and Stevens as<br />\nlinebackers will he JIm Moran<br />\nand Duke (Killer) Haggerty. Les<br />\nMatthews, Jack Coulter, and<br />\nRick Kramer will be the deep<br />\nthree.<br />\nOn offense, Sam Palmisano<br />\nwill be the center with John<br />\nNutting and Jim Duffy flanking<br />\nhim on each side. The rest of the<br />\ninterior line is unsettled due to<br />\ninjuries. Jim Adams is a probable<br />\nstarter at left tackle, but Joe<br />\nCuslander sustained a separated<br />\nshoulder last Saturday and is<br />\ndoubtful. Should he not play,<br />\n<br />\nBruce Parker will take his place.<br />\nSteady Grant Shevchik will -again<br />\nbe the wide receiver, but the<br />\ntight end position remains<br />\nunsettled. It is still to be seen<br />\nwhether RickKowalchuk (if ite is<br />\nhealthy) or Mike Bogdan will<br />\nstart.<br />\nIn the backfield, Thomas and<br />\nNolan will be joined by Jim<br />\nFerguson at fullback and Tim<br />\nDoyle at halfback. Harry Stringer<br />\nis injured (hip pointer) and<br />\nprobably will not be ready to<br />\nstart.<br />\nFrom the spirited practices<br />\nthis past week, it looks as if the<br />\nBlue Jays learned their lesson last<br />\nSaturday. Barring an act of<br />\nnature or similar disturbance,<br />\nHopkins should pull away in the<br />\nsecond half and record a<br />\nconvincing win this Saturday.<br />\n<br />\nup with the big fielding play, the<br />\nkey hit, or a daring sprint on the<br />\nbasepaths at a game's most<br />\ncritical _moment. The career of<br />\nJackie Robinson spanned only<br />\nnine years, but it was more than<br />\ncoincidence that the Dodgers<br />\namassed six National League<br />\npennants and one world<br />\nchampionship during that time.<br />\nWhen he was enshrined in<br />\nbaseball's Hall of Fame at<br />\nCooperstown, his performance<br />\nabove all was cited as the only<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nRobinson<br />\nJackie Robinson, the baseball<br />\nplayer, had died years ago, but<br />\none only need to turn on the<br />\ntelevision or go to the ballpark to<br />\nwatch the incomparable play of<br />\nWillie Mays, Henry Aaron or<br />\nFrank Robinson. One can look at<br />\na crop of rookies like Don<br />\nBaylor, Bobby Darwin, and<br />\nDusty Baker, all blackRobinson.<br />\nOne can look at a crop of rookies<br />\nlike Don Baylor, Bobby Darwin,<br />\nand Dusty Baker, all black, and<br />\nappreciate that the gauge that<br />\nmeasured them was ability alone.<br />\nJackie Robinson transformed the<br />\nimpossible into the commonplace<br />\nof today. But the man who gave<br />\n<br />\nRutkowski named<br />\nsoccer player of week<br />\n<br />\nCoach Cox.<br />\n<br />\nDuring practice one day this<br />\nweek, Joe Rutkowski was<br />\nattempting to score with a<br />\nright-footed shot when the ball<br />\ntook a crazy hop and threatened<br />\nto skip past him Instantly.<br />\nRutkowski stopped his' kick,<br />\nswung his left leg and drilled a<br />\nbullet into the corner of the net.<br />\nSuch dexterity is rarely seen<br />\non the 1Topkins soccer field, but<br />\nis not at all uncommon for the<br />\n'freshman from Dundalk. In fact,<br />\nhis skills were so much in<br />\nevidence against Loyola that<br />\nCoach Robert Oliver and the<br />\nNews\u2014Letter have awarded him<br />\nthe title of soccer player of the<br />\n<br />\nThinclads bow to Swarthmore<br />\nWednesday in Chester.<br />\nPennsylvania the Hopkins cross<br />\ncountry team bowed to a strong<br />\nteam from defending M.A.C.<br />\nchampion, Swarthmore College,<br />\n16 - 43.<br />\nIn spite of the score, Hopkins<br />\nrunners did well under the<br />\nconditions. The soggy, slippery<br />\n4.5 mile course proved to be<br />\nquite a challenge to all of the<br />\nBlue Jay runners. According to<br />\nCoach Don Masken, \"Their<br />\ncourse is the same length as ours<br />\nand thier course record isn't<br />\ngood, but it's a lot tougher<br />\ncourse to run.\" Hopkins placed<br />\nfour men in the top ten,<br />\n\"...which is one of our better<br />\nshowings in recent years against<br />\nthem,\" commented Masken.<br />\nDespite the efforts of Russ<br />\nDubiel and Jeff Greve the<br />\nopposition too the first four<br />\nplaces. HOwever, Dubiel did<br />\nplace fifth to prevent<br />\nSwarthmore from scoring the<br />\n<br />\nnew meaning to the words \"black<br />\npride\" remained at war with<br />\nbaseball even up until the time of<br />\nhis death.<br />\nJust a couple of weeks ago, at<br />\na ceremony honoring him during<br />\nthe World Series, he asked once<br />\nagain that baseball name a black<br />\nmanager to its ranks. Certainly it<br />\nis inevitable, but Robinson would<br />\nnever live to see it.<br />\nEven after his playing days<br />\nwere over, Jackie Robinson<br />\ncontinued actively in the Civil<br />\nRights movement in this country.<br />\nIn recent years, there were those<br />\nin his race that disagreed with his<br />\nintergrationist ideals, some<br />\ncalling him an Uncle Tom. Still<br />\nRobinson remained steadfast in<br />\nhis beliefs, even while he suffered<br />\nphysical degradation. He had<br />\ndiabetes, high blood pressure, a<br />\nbad heart, and was losing his<br />\neyesight. A year ago he lost a<br />\nson.<br />\nJackie Robinson, the baseball<br />\nplayer, the man, is dead. His<br />\ninfectious spirit that nourished<br />\nand revitalized an entire race, will<br />\nlive on. In a day when man is in<br />\nincreasing need of heroes, the<br />\nleadership and courage of Jack<br />\nRoosevelt Robinson is legendary.<br />\n<br />\nlowest possible fiften points.<br />\nOther top placers for the Blue<br />\nJays were Greve in seventh place,<br />\nJon Higdonin ninth, Austin<br />\nDoyle in tenth, and John<br />\nTetzlaff.<br />\nOne of the closer finishes of<br />\nthe afternoon was between<br />\nteammates Jon Higdon and<br />\nAustin Doyle. Austin jumped out<br />\nto a fast start in the race, but<br />\nseemed to have a slim chance of<br />\ncatching Higdon at the end. \"But<br />\nAustin wasn't going to just give<br />\nup a place and settle for tenth.<br />\nHe ran hard and almost caught<br />\nJon. I think Jon was surprised<br />\nthat he had that much left at the<br />\nend,\" said Masken as he<br />\nrecounted the events of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nSwarthmore may be able to<br />\nrepeat thier championship win of<br />\nlast year. According to his coach,<br />\nsophomore Steve Lubar, who<br />\nwon Wednesday, should win the<br />\nM.A.C. individual title with little<br />\n<br />\nDon Maskill<br />\nproblem. Last year's champion,<br />\nRick Schultz, is also expected to<br />\nplace high. Whether these events<br />\noccur or will not will be clear by<br />\nMonday night, when the<br />\nchampionships close.<br />\n<br />\nweek.<br />\n_Hounds<br />\nThough the<br />\ndominated Monday's game,<br />\nRutkowski played as well as any<br />\nof his opponents. On defense,<br />\nRutkowski was steadfast,<br />\nconstantly breaking up Loyola's<br />\nattacks. The first man he played<br />\nagainst was left wing Mike<br />\nQuarante who was so badly<br />\ndominated that Coach Jim<br />\nBullinton took him out of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nFullback<br />\nThough he played at fullback.<br />\nRutkowski was alia.s the Jays'<br />\nstrongest offensive player. His'<br />\nclever, short passes were the<br />\ncatalyst for most Of Hopkins'<br />\nscoring efforts. Early in the<br />\nsecond half, Joe's accurate lead<br />\npass sent Rich White in to the<br />\ngoal mouth on a play that almost<br />\nknotted the score.<br />\nIn short, Joe is an intelligent<br />\nsoccer player, possessing<br />\ngenerous amounts of the \"savvy'<br />\nthat his coach loves to cite. AS<br />\nRutkowski said, \"In high school.<br />\nfrom my junior year on, I played<br />\nall year around. Then, in the<br />\nsummer, my team and I played<br />\neveryday for three or four<br />\nhours\".<br />\nHe added,\"Playing at Dundalk<br />\nis just like playing with your<br />\nfamily. When you make a pass<br />\nyou know somebody is go8ng to<br />\nbe where the ball is\".<br />\nDifferent<br />\nAt Hopkins, Joe feels the<br />\nattitude is different. While<br />\nemphasizing that he wasn t<br />\n\"knocking \u2014 his mates. he<br />\nsuggested that \"Hopkins'students<br />\ndon't really take soccer<br />\nseroously\". Happily, eh added<br />\nthat \"Coach Oliver is attempting<br />\nto make soccer a serious \u2022<br />\nbusiness\" by recruiting other citY<br />\nboys who play year around.<br />\n<br />\n\fnovember 3, 1972/news-letter/page 15<br />\n<br />\nBlack Hawks and Canadiens to lead NHL<br />\nEd. note: With the National<br />\nHockey League season well under<br />\nway now,the News - Letter<br />\nthought it would be interesting<br />\nto provide the following team by<br />\nteam anaysis and predictions:<br />\n<br />\nPittsburgh - The Penguins have<br />\nClippers last year.

Ed<br />\nGiacomin is highly overrated and<br />\nGilles Villemure lacks the<br />\nstamina to play a full season.<br />\nBrad Park is a great offenseman<br />\nwho tends to forget he is<br />\nsupposed to play defense.

This<br />\nweek's NewsNews<br />\nweek had<br />\narrived early (or Analysis<br />\nperhaps finally<br />\non time) with<br />\nlong reports of the impending<br />\n\"peace\" in Vietnam and the<br />\nupcoming elections. Having had<br />\nenough of the current rhetoric on<br />\npeace, I turned to page 40 to see<br />\nthis newsweekly's pre-election<br />\nanalysis. I wish I would had stuck<br />\nto peace.<br />\nPre-election analysis is sticky<br />\nbusiness. The analyst is dealing<br />\nwith polls that can be refuted<br />\nwith other polls; opinions that<br />\ncan be \"out-facted\" by other<br />\nopinions; information that can be<br />\n\"out-sourced\" by other<br />\ninformation. In the end, what is<br />\nsaid before an election is of<br />\nnegligible importance compared<br />\nto what is said following. But the<br />\npublic demands analysis before<br />\nthe fact, as they demand that<br />\nWalter Cronkite tell us who the<br />\nnext president is by 7:30 within<br />\n1 percent of the vote counted.<br />\nAnyone can analyze an election<br />\nbefore it takes place and their<br />\npredictions are just as reliable<br />\nand \"valid\" as Newsweek 's or<br />\nTom Wicker's.<br />\nThe tone of this election was<br />\nunfortunately set when Toni<br />\nEagleton was dropped from the<br />\nDemocratic ticket as the Vice<br />\nPresidential nominee. Everytime<br />\nthat affair is dragged through the<br />\nmud (even today the columnists<br />\nwrite about it) a disservice to the<br />\ncampaign and the country is<br />\nperformed. I even regret<br />\nmentioning the \"Eagleton<br />\nAffair\"now, but a clarification is<br />\nneeded. If, as the argument goes,<br />\nSenator Eagleton was left on the<br />\nticket, his health would have<br />\nbeen an issue throughout the<br />\ncampaign. Eagleton was dropped,<br />\nas demanded, and a thorough<br />\ndiscussion of the issues was<br />\nexpected to follow.<br />\nUnfortunately, this hasn't<br />\nhappened at all. The press has<br />\nused the \"Eagleton Affair\" and<br />\nsubsequent \"mind changes\" by<br />\nSenator McGovern as an excuse<br />\nfor not presenting the issues<br />\nsquarely before the people.<br />\nNewsweek 's analysis, which lacks<br />\nany comment on the issues, is a<br />\nglaring example of the<br />\nperformance of the majority of<br />\nthe media, who have focused<br />\nprimarily on the personalities,<br />\nfaults, attributes of the candidate<br />\nand the incumbent. The<br />\neconomy, welfare reform, health<br />\ninsurance, defense spending,<br />\ncorruption, and other problems<br />\nwhich will become blackheads on<br />\nthe face of America in the next<br />\nfour years have been virtually<br />\nignored. Only a few papers and<br />\nnetworks have shed light in the<br />\ntunnel that the media and the<br />\nincumbent are leading us<br />\nthrough.<br />\nThe press is by no means<br />\nentirely to blame. The media's<br />\nprimary responsibility is to<br />\nreport what the candidates are<br />\nsaying and discussing Lin addresses<br />\nbefore the people. Regardless of<br />\n<br />\none's bias, one must admit that<br />\nthere has been no real discuaaion<br />\nbetween the candidates in this<br />\n,campaign. Discussion implies<br />\ndialogue between two parties of<br />\nwhich we have seen none.<br />\nSenator McGovern should be<br />\ncommended for addressing<br />\nhimself to the'fundamental issues<br />\nbefore us. He has been hampered,<br />\nthough, by no response from the<br />\nincumbent. We have seen ,him<br />\ntalking to an empty chair. No<br />\ncandidate has campaigned as<br />\nlittle as Richard Nixon since<br />\nWarren Harding. This, by itself,<br />\nhas blocked any possibility for a<br />\ngood campaign or a good<br />\nelection.<br />\nI have prefaced this analysis<br />\nwith a look at the campaign<br />\nbecause, obviously, the election<br />\nis a direct result of the campaign.<br />\nHence, if you don't have a good<br />\ncampaign, you can't have a good<br />\nelection. Regardless of the<br />\nwinner, I view this campaign as<br />\n<br />\none that hopefully will not be<br />\nrepeated for years to come.<br />\nAny pre-election analysis must<br />\nrely heavily on the polls, so. as<br />\nmuch as I wish I could, I cannot<br />\ndeviate from this norm. But there<br />\nis one nice rule about polls<br />\nthey can be used to interpret<br />\nopposite conclusions. I will<br />\nemploy this \"rule of opposite<br />\nconclusions\" liberally in the next<br />\nfew paragraphs.<br />\nThere are four sets of data<br />\n\u2018vhich are of interest in the<br />\nclosing week of this campaign.<br />\nThe last New York<br />\nTimeslYankelovich poll gives<br />\nNixon 56% and McGovern 30%<br />\nof the vote. The 'latest Gallup<br />\npoll has Nixon receiving 59% of'<br />\nthe vote and McGovern 36%. The<br />\naggegate count of Newsweek 's six<br />\nkey states (California, Illinois,<br />\nMichigan, New York. Ohio. and<br />\nPennsylvania) is 57% - 38% with<br />\nNixon again the leader. The key<br />\npoll (for this analysis) is a recent<br />\n<br />\nSindlinger poll suggesting that<br />\nonly 59% of Nixon's backers plan<br />\nto vote while 91% of the.<br />\nMcGovern prospects plan to pull<br />\nthe lever. If this data is accurate<br />\nWe can interpolate the figures<br />\ninto the other polls and come up<br />\nwith perhaps more accurate<br />\nresults.<br />\nWhen we compute the<br />\nTimes/Yankehmich poll we find<br />\nthings have changed a lot - 47%<br />\nfor Nixon and 38% for McGovern<br />\nwith a large percentage<br />\nundecided. A new Gallup poll<br />\nworks out to 49.7% for Nixon<br />\nand 46.8% for McGovern. The .<br />\nelection gets closer yet.<br />\nNewsweek 's six state poll. with<br />\nthe Sindlinger influence tips in<br />\nfavor of McGovern who recieves<br />\n49.4%. of the vote to Nixon's<br />\n48%. All you McGovern<br />\nsupporters should not start<br />\nproclaiming victory. These<br />\nfigures are largely conjecture and<br />\na re based solely on the accuracy<br />\n<br />\nNixon stumps in key Senate races<br />\nPresident Nixon's plans to<br />\nstump this weekend in several<br />\nstates with key Senate races may<br />\nwell indicate that Republican<br />\ncontrol of the next Senate is<br />\nfarther from reality than most<br />\nRepublican soothsayers once<br />\nprojected.<br />\nNixon will travel to Rhode<br />\nIsland, Oklahoma, North<br />\nCarolina, and New Mexico before<br />\nretreating to the Western White<br />\nHouse for election day. Each of<br />\nthese states have Senate seats<br />\nRepublicans are banking on for<br />\ncontrol in the 93rd upper house.<br />\nOff 33 Senate seats up for<br />\ncontention, Republicans now<br />\nhold 19, and need a net gain of 6<br />\n(or five if Nixon wins re-election<br />\nallowing Vice-President Spiro<br />\nAgnew to break a 50-50 tie) .<br />\nLast week Nixon stopped over<br />\nin Kentucky to aid former<br />\nRepublican Governor Louie<br />\nNunn,who now has the edge over<br />\nDemocratic state house majority<br />\nleader Walter Huddleson.<br />\nRe tiring Re publican Senator<br />\nJohn Sherman Cooper's seat<br />\nmust be won by Nunn for<br />\nRepublican hopes to stay alive.<br />\nLatest polls give Nunn a 2<br />\npercent lead with more than 20<br />\npercent undecided.<br />\nAhead<br />\nIn Rhode Island, the state's<br />\nlargest newspaper published a<br />\npoll yesterday showing<br />\nDemocratic incumbent Claiborne<br />\nPell ahead of former Governor<br />\nJohn Chafee 42 - 40 with 18<br />\nPercent undecided. The<br />\nProvidence Journal poll had<br />\nearlier shown. Chafee a 2 -1<br />\nfavorite. The race is still too close<br />\nto call, but significant in the<br />\npoll's findings is a substantial<br />\nreturn of Democrats to the fold<br />\nin the Senate races. The Chafee<br />\nfamily owns 50 percent of the<br />\nJournal and editors are planning<br />\nto endorse one of the two<br />\ncandidates this Sunday; In<br />\nOklahoma, whose Senator Fred<br />\nHarris briefly a presidential<br />\ncandidate retired after one term,<br />\nTulsa oil executive and former<br />\nRepublican Governor Dewey<br />\nBartlet is giving slightly favored<br />\n<br />\nCongressman Ed 1::dinondson<br />\nstiff challenge.

Everett<br />\nJordon in North Carolina's senate<br />\nprimary, leads a conservative<br />\nRepublican challenger Jesse<br />\nHelms. Helms, who earlier this<br />\nyear criticized Nixon for<br />\n\"appeasing Red China\" is<br />\nreaching out for his coattails.<br />\n<br />\nThe contest for Democratic<br />\nSenator Clinton Anderson'S seat<br />\nin New Mexico is as close as the<br />\nPell - Chafee race. Democrat Jack<br />\nDaniels and Republican Pete<br />\nDomenici are neck and neck in a<br />\nstate Nixon lost in 1960 and won<br />\nin '68, though some observers<br />\nhave given Domenici a slight<br />\nedge.<br />\nThe President will jump<br />\nheadlong into these four Senate<br />\nraces t od ay and tomorrow,<br />\nextending his coattails the extra<br />\ninches that inay yield votes for<br />\nGOP candidates from traditional<br />\nDemocrats dissatisfied with the<br />\nMcGovern party. Just how<br />\ndeeply Nixon's appeal extends<br />\nbelow the Presidential level<br />\nremains to be seen.<br />\nThe President's avoidance of<br />\nthe Texas Senais facing a tough<br />\nrace against Connally supported<br />\nDe m oc rat Barefoot Saunders,<br />\nindicates the careful<br />\norchestration of the whole<br />\nRepublican effort in 1972.<br />\n<br />\nof the Sindlinger poll which is<br />\nsubject to as much questioning as<br />\nany other poll. But these new<br />\nfigures do point to an election<br />\nmuch tighter than Newsweek and<br />\nmost others would have us<br />\nbelieve. In the end, a landslide or<br />\na close election hinges primarily<br />\non voter interpretation of the<br />\nother article in this week's<br />\nNelvsweek.<br />\nConventional wisdom tells us<br />\nthat any major foreign policy<br />\ninitiative by an incumbent<br />\nPresident running for reelection<br />\nis good for several points in the<br />\npolls. The latest Harris poll seems<br />\nto confirm this rule. However,<br />\nthe rule of opposite conclusions<br />\nagain rears its ugly head. The<br />\npeace initiative can do several<br />\nthings. First, it can appear as a<br />\npurely political move on the part<br />\nof the President. Second, voters<br />\nmight wonder, as does George<br />\nMcGovern, why the settlement<br />\ndidn't come four years ago. ABC<br />\nNews found both these<br />\ninterpretations prevalent in their<br />\n.All -American city, Columbus,<br />\nOhio. The third important<br />\nviewpoint is that voters will now<br />\nsee the election in more<br />\ntraditional economic terms, now<br />\nthat the war is apparently really<br />\nending. Here McGovern has the<br />\nedge in the polls and voters may<br />\nnow turn to him. Again, these<br />\nare only<br />\nin<br />\nconjecture, but then any<br />\npre -el cc lion analysis is. These<br />\nfactors do, however, indicate we<br />\nmay see a closer election Tuesday<br />\nnight.<br />\nAfter all the polls are taken,<br />\nonly one will mean anything at<br />\nall<br />\nthe election on November<br />\n7. If Mr. Nixon wins in a<br />\nlandslide, I reserve the right to be<br />\nwrong and chalk it up to<br />\n\"statistical error\" and admitted<br />\noptimism. If I am correct and it<br />\nis a close election, I claim the<br />\nprediction now and chalk it up to<br />\nkeen analysis, admitted optimism<br />\nand, most of all, pure luck. At<br />\nany rate, I won't be turning the<br />\ntubes off at 7:30 on Tuesday<br />\nnight.

Fitzpatrick reported,<br />\n\"This is not a complete solution<br />\nto our housing problems, but it is<br />\none step that can help.\"<br />\nHe added, \"Neither institution<br />\nhas made a definite committment<br />\nto do it. We're just trying to see<br />\nif there is sufficient student<br />\ninterest.\"<br />\nStudent reaction at Johns<br />\nHopkins has been largely<br />\nfavorable.

We can guarantee<br />\nspace for 50 men, but anything<br />\nunder 25 would be nearly<br />\ntokenism.\"<br />\nShe indicated that additional<br />\nspace, if needed, could be<br />\nobtained by allowing students to<br />\nlive off-campus.<br />\nNo plans to allow Goucher<br /><br />\nwomen to live at Hopkins have<br />\nbeen disclosed. Echoing criticism<br />\nfrom some Goucher<br />\nundergraduates, Loftus<br />\nsuggested, \"I feel that they<br />\nshould give all Goucher girls the<br />\noption of moving off-campus.\"<br />\nIroned<br />\nAmong difficulties which<br />\nwould have to be ironed out<br />\nbefore the plan could get<br />\nunderway, according to Hopkins<br />\nDirector of Student Affairs<br />\nDottie Lebo, are liberalized rules<br />\nfor exchange courses,<br />\ntransportation, and room and<br />\nboard rates.<br />\nAt present, students at either<br />\nschool must obtain permission<br />\nfrom both schools to enroll in a<br />\nmaximum of one course per<br />\nsemester at the other institution.<br />\nAdditional enrollment<br />\nopportunities might be necessary<br />\nunder the new plan, Lebo<br />\nindicated.<br />\nAlthough a shuttle bus runs<br />\nthe seven-mile route between the<br />\ntwo campuses hourly until<br />\n6:00p.m., Fitzpatrick stated that<br />\nlater runs would be necessary.<br />\nAnother problem is room and<br />\nboard. All dormitory students at<br />\nGoucher must presently sign up<br />\nfor meals, which are included in<br />\nthe $1550 room and board rate.<br /><br />\nGoucher students must pay an<br />\nadditional $100 for the January<br />\nsession. Two such sessions are<br />\nrequired for graduation.<br />\nThe current rate for room and<br />\nboard at Hopkins is $1375 for a<br />\ndouble room, and $1475 for a<br />\nsingle. There is no additional<br />\ncharge for the January session.<br />\nUpperclassmen are not required<br />\nto pay the board fee of<br />\napproximatley $5 30.<br />\nLoftus suggested that students<br />\nwould be willing to pay the<br />\nGoucher board rate, because<br />\n\"Their food seems somewhat<br />\nbetter than ours.\"<br />\n'Jerry Van Voorhis, assistant to<br />\nHopkins head resident counselor<br />\nCol.

Last<br />\nnight, I spent some time with a friend<br />\nwho told me that the Student Council is<br />\ntoo \"personalized\" because four or five<br />\npeople ARE DOING MOST OF THE<br />\nWORK. I was told that I should spend my<br />\ntime trying to \"institutionalize\" student<br />\npower so that when this year's Council<br />\nretired, the next would have their<br />\n\"power': established.<br />\nThis is a great idea. There is nothing I<br />\nwould like better than some sort of<br />\nUniversity \"Great Book\" saying that<br />\nstudents can take votes to decide this and<br />\nthat. Fat chance.

(This isn't<br />\nalways the case.) When talking to people I<br />\ndon't even bother to give my name any<br />\nmore, I just say that I'm President of the<br />\nStudent Council and presto! it's instant<br />\nappointment, meeting - and sometimes<br />\naction.<br />\nThe problem with Student Councils in<br />\nthe past is that the only time<br />\ncommittment that was made was during<br />\nthe meetings. The members of this year's<br />\nCouncil are doing their work during the<br />\nweek. No decision will ever be actually<br />\nmade concerning any important<br />\nUniversity policy at a Student Council<br />\nmeeting. The decisions are made in<br />\nGarland Hall (and other places) during<br />\nthe week. We just make sure apt we're<br />\nthere when those decisions are being<br />\nformulated and actually made.<br />\nWhat we try to do at meetings is decide<br />\nhow we and the undergraduates feel<br />\nabout cetain things. We try to divide up<br />\nthe labor. Nobody can be an expert on<br />\neverything. Some members work on<br />\nhousing, others on the Honor<br />\nCommission. Some members deal with<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, others are into<br />\nsheer academic problems.

For the film is<br />\nat once the most.complex and the least<br />\nabstract of the creative arts. It is also the<br />\nmost social and technological of art<br />\nforms.

And in doing so he<br />\nwas able to obtain total control of his<br />\nfilms. (His worst films were the ones<br />\nwhere this control was infringed upon.)<br />\nIn this way he was able to combine the<br />\n,talents of great scenarists (Robert Riskin,<br />\nSidney Buchman), great photographers<br />\n(Joseph Walker.

It may never get to the point<br />\nwhere they're soliciting your advice but<br />\nsoon it almost seems natural to ask the<br />\nundergraduates what they think about<br />\nthings.<br />\nSo the Student Council will continue<br />\nto operate the way they have been this<br />\nyear. As individual students who spend<br />\nsome time during the week talking and<br />\nproposing ideas to people who can put<br />\nthese ideas into use. The meeting may not<br />\nbe too exciting and Student Council<br />\nmembers may not get too much publicity<br />\nabout what they are doing. but it's<br />\ngetting done.

In one of Gilman's letters from<br />\noverseas, he records a serious observation<br />\nOven him by a professor at the University<br />\nat Freiburg, Baden:<br /><br />\n1 hope the trustees will not<br />\nbe scandalized by their<br />\nmathematical professor having composed a poem of<br />\n201 lines, all (except five)<br />\nrhyming to \"Rosalind.\"<br /><br />\nHere also are Gilman's letters from the<br />\nBritish Isles and the continent where he<br />\nwas sent in the summer of 1875 to collect<br />\nideas. Travelling with the first of his<br />\nchoices for the original faculty, Henry<br />\nRowland, he found most of the<br />\nuniversities there to be out of session,<br />\nmost of the professors to be on vacation,<br />\nand his own project to be \"making less<br />\nprogress than I could wish.\" He was,<br />\nhowever, deeply impressed, expecially by<br />\nthe German institutions and did manage<br />\nto get a broad impression of the steps he<br />\nwould take in structuring an American<br />\nuniversity in the European style. It meant<br />\nsteering away from strictly career oriented<br />\neducation toward open-ended research,<br />\nand collecting a faculty deserving of the<br />\nopportunity to escape the then narrow<br />\nlimits of American higher education.<br />\nHere, too, are the letters between<br />\nGilamn and the original faculty members,<br />\nsuch as J.

Robinson had<br />\nbeen an All-American football<br />\nplayer at U.C.L.A. before signing<br />\nwith the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br />\nAfter only one year with the<br />\nMontreal Royals in which he led<br />\nthe International League in<br />\nbatting average amd stolen bases,<br />\nhe was brought up to Brooklyn<br />\nat the age of twenty seven.<br />\nFighting, clawing and scratching<br />\nin an environment hostile, racist,<br />\nand at first unwilling to accept<br />\nhim, he won victory after victory<br /><br />\nfor himself and his people.<br />\nRobinson batted .297 his first<br />\nyear in the majors, led the<br />\nNational League in stolen bases<br />\nwith twenty nine, and was named<br />\nrookie of the year. Two years<br />\nlater, he won the Most Valuable<br />\nPlayer award while leading the<br />\nleague in batting (.342) and<br />\nstolen bases again (thirty seven).<br />\nThat same season he drove. in 124<br />\nruns while compiling a<br />\nremarkable 303 hits.<br />\nBut aside from this and his<br />\noutstanding lifetime average of<br />\n.311 - Robinson was one of the<br />\ngreat clutch players of his era.<br />\nTime after endless time he came<br /><br />\nNan-LETTER<br /><br />\nSpORTS<br />\nJay footballers to<br />\nseek winning track<br />\nThe Hopkin's varsity football<br />\nteam will attempt to get back on<br />\nthe winning track tomorrow at<br />\nSwarthmore, as they battle the<br />\nwinless Swarthmore Garnet.<br />\nSince Hopkins has shown a knack<br />\nfor losing to winless teams,<br />\nnothing will be certain until the<br />\nfinal whistle has sounded.<br />\nFor the most part,<br />\nSwarthmore's losses this year<br />\nhave been close games.<br />\nSwarthmore has good talent in<br />\naddition to the best wide receiver<br />\nin the conference, though the<br />\nteam as a whole does suffer from<br />\na definite lack of depth (only 25<br />\nmen on the team).<br />\nAs a result of this shortage of<br />\nmen, the barnets do tire in the<br />\nsecond half and make mistakes.<br />\nThese mistakes usually take the<br />\nform of big plays, long runs, deep<br />\npass completion or punt return<br />\nfor a touchdown.<br />\nCox is looking for a big game<br />\nfrom the entire team after the<br />\nTowson debacle, but looks for<br />\nJack Thomas and Billy NOlan to<br />\nlead fie way on offense. On<br />\ndefense, Gunter Glocker and<br />\nCraig Stevens must play well to<br />\nensure that Swarthmore does not<br />\nput many points on the<br />\nscoreboard.<br />\nRon Hall will continue to start<br />\nat defensive end with Bruce<br />\nJackson, Deith Krantz, and Mike<br />\nKrantz, and Mike O'Brien filling<br />\nout the defensive line. Joining<br />\nGlocker and Stevens as<br />\nlinebackers will he JIm Moran<br />\nand Duke (Killer) Haggerty. Les<br />\nMatthews, Jack Coulter, and<br />\nRick Kramer will be the deep<br />\nthree.<br />\nOn offense, Sam Palmisano<br />\nwill be the center with John<br />\nNutting and Jim Duffy flanking<br />\nhim on each side. The rest of the<br />\ninterior line is unsettled due to<br />\ninjuries. Jim Adams is a probable<br />\nstarter at left tackle, but Joe<br />\nCuslander sustained a separated<br />\nshoulder last Saturday and is<br />\ndoubtful. Should he not play,<br /><br />\nBruce Parker will take his place.<br />\nSteady Grant Shevchik will -again<br />\nbe the wide receiver, but the<br />\ntight end position remains<br />\nunsettled. It is still to be seen<br />\nwhether RickKowalchuk (if ite is<br />\nhealthy) or Mike Bogdan will<br />\nstart.<br />\nIn the backfield, Thomas and<br />\nNolan will be joined by Jim<br />\nFerguson at fullback and Tim<br />\nDoyle at halfback. Harry Stringer<br />\nis injured (hip pointer) and<br />\nprobably will not be ready to<br />\nstart.<br />\nFrom the spirited practices<br />\nthis past week, it looks as if the<br />\nBlue Jays learned their lesson last<br />\nSaturday. Barring an act of<br />\nnature or similar disturbance,<br />\nHopkins should pull away in the<br />\nsecond half and record a<br />\nconvincing win this Saturday.<br /><br />\nup with the big fielding play, the<br />\nkey hit, or a daring sprint on the<br />\nbasepaths at a game's most<br />\ncritical _moment. The career of<br />\nJackie Robinson spanned only<br />\nnine years, but it was more than<br />\ncoincidence that the Dodgers<br />\namassed six National League<br />\npennants and one world<br />\nchampionship during that time.<br />\nWhen he was enshrined in<br />\nbaseball's Hall of Fame at<br />\nCooperstown, his performance<br />\nabove all was cited as the only<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nRobinson<br />\nJackie Robinson, the baseball<br />\nplayer, had died years ago, but<br />\none only need to turn on the<br />\ntelevision or go to the ballpark to<br />\nwatch the incomparable play of<br />\nWillie Mays, Henry Aaron or<br />\nFrank Robinson.

But the man who gave<br /><br />\nRutkowski named<br />\nsoccer player of week<br /><br />\nCoach Cox.<br /><br />\nDuring practice one day this<br />\nweek, Joe Rutkowski was<br />\nattempting to score with a<br />\nright-footed shot when the ball<br />\ntook a crazy hop and threatened<br />\nto skip past him Instantly.<br />\nRutkowski stopped his' kick,<br />\nswung his left leg and drilled a<br />\nbullet into the corner of the net.<br />\nSuch dexterity is rarely seen<br />\non the 1Topkins soccer field, but<br />\nis not at all uncommon for the<br />\n'freshman from Dundalk. In fact,<br />\nhis skills were so much in<br />\nevidence against Loyola that<br />\nCoach Robert Oliver and the<br />\nNews\u2014Letter have awarded him<br />\nthe title of soccer player of the<br /><br />\nThinclads bow to Swarthmore<br />\nWednesday in Chester.<br />\nPennsylvania the Hopkins cross<br />\ncountry team bowed to a strong<br />\nteam from defending M.A.C.<br />\nchampion, Swarthmore College,<br />\n16 - 43.<br />\nIn spite of the score, Hopkins<br />\nrunners did well under the<br />\nconditions. The soggy, slippery<br />\n4.5 mile course proved to be<br />\nquite a challenge to all of the<br />\nBlue Jay runners. According to<br />\nCoach Don Masken, \"Their<br />\ncourse is the same length as ours<br />\nand thier course record isn't<br />\ngood, but it's a lot tougher<br />\ncourse to run.\" Hopkins placed<br />\nfour men in the top ten,<br />\n\"...which is one of our better<br />\nshowings in recent years against<br />\nthem,\" commented Masken.<br />\nDespite the efforts of Russ<br />\nDubiel and Jeff Greve the<br />\nopposition too the first four<br />\nplaces. HOwever, Dubiel did<br />\nplace fifth to prevent<br />\nSwarthmore from scoring the<br /><br />\nnew meaning to the words \"black<br />\npride\" remained at war with<br />\nbaseball even up until the time of<br />\nhis death.<br />\nJust a couple of weeks ago, at<br />\na ceremony honoring him during<br />\nthe World Series, he asked once<br />\nagain that baseball name a black<br />\nmanager to its ranks. Certainly it<br />\nis inevitable, but Robinson would<br />\nnever live to see it.<br />\nEven after his playing days<br />\nwere over, Jackie Robinson<br />\ncontinued actively in the Civil<br />\nRights movement in this country.<br />\nIn recent years, there were those<br />\nin his race that disagreed with his<br />\nintergrationist ideals, some<br />\ncalling him an Uncle Tom. Still<br />\nRobinson remained steadfast in<br />\nhis beliefs, even while he suffered<br />\nphysical degradation. He had<br />\ndiabetes, high blood pressure, a<br />\nbad heart, and was losing his<br />\neyesight. A year ago he lost a<br />\nson.<br />\nJackie Robinson, the baseball<br />\nplayer, the man, is dead. His<br />\ninfectious spirit that nourished<br />\nand revitalized an entire race, will<br />\nlive on. In a day when man is in<br />\nincreasing need of heroes, the<br />\nleadership and courage of Jack<br />\nRoosevelt Robinson is legendary.<br /><br />\nlowest possible fiften points.<br />\nOther top placers for the Blue<br />\nJays were Greve in seventh place,<br />\nJon Higdonin ninth, Austin<br />\nDoyle in tenth, and John<br />\nTetzlaff.<br />\nOne of the closer finishes of<br />\nthe afternoon was between<br />\nteammates Jon Higdon and<br />\nAustin Doyle. Austin jumped out<br />\nto a fast start in the race, but<br />\nseemed to have a slim chance of<br />\ncatching Higdon at the end. \"But<br />\nAustin wasn't going to just give<br />\nup a place and settle for tenth.<br />\nHe ran hard and almost caught<br />\nJon. I think Jon was surprised<br />\nthat he had that much left at the<br />\nend,\" said Masken as he<br />\nrecounted the events of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nSwarthmore may be able to<br />\nrepeat thier championship win of<br />\nlast year. According to his coach,<br />\nsophomore Steve Lubar, who<br />\nwon Wednesday, should win the<br />\nM.A.C. individual title with little<br /><br />\nDon Maskill<br />\nproblem. Last year's champion,<br />\nRick Schultz, is also expected to<br />\nplace high. Whether these events<br />\noccur or will not will be clear by<br />\nMonday night, when the<br />\nchampionships close.<br /><br />\nweek.<br />\n_Hounds<br />\nThough the<br />\ndominated Monday's game,<br />\nRutkowski played as well as any<br />\nof his opponents. On defense,<br />\nRutkowski was steadfast,<br />\nconstantly breaking up Loyola's<br />\nattacks. The first man he played<br />\nagainst was left wing Mike<br />\nQuarante who was so badly<br />\ndominated that Coach Jim<br />\nBullinton took him out of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nFullback<br />\nThough he played at fullback.<br />\nRutkowski was alia.s the Jays'<br />\nstrongest offensive player. His'<br />\nclever, short passes were the<br />\ncatalyst for most Of Hopkins'<br />\nscoring efforts. Early in the<br />\nsecond half, Joe's accurate lead<br />\npass sent Rich White in to the<br />\ngoal mouth on a play that almost<br />\nknotted the score.<br />\nIn short, Joe is an intelligent<br />\nsoccer player, possessing<br />\ngenerous amounts of the \"savvy'<br />\nthat his coach loves to cite. AS<br />\nRutkowski said, \"In high school.<br />\nfrom my junior year on, I played<br />\nall year around. Then, in the<br />\nsummer, my team and I played<br />\neveryday for three or four<br />\nhours\".<br />\nHe added,\"Playing at Dundalk<br />\nis just like playing with your<br />\nfamily. When you make a pass<br />\nyou know somebody is go8ng to<br />\nbe where the ball is\".<br />\nDifferent<br />\nAt Hopkins, Joe feels the<br />\nattitude is different. While<br />\nemphasizing that he wasn t<br />\n\"knocking \u2014 his mates. he<br />\nsuggested that \"Hopkins'students<br />\ndon't really take soccer<br />\nseroously\". Happily, eh added<br />\nthat \"Coach Oliver is attempting<br />\nto make soccer a serious \u2022<br />\nbusiness\" by recruiting other citY<br />\nboys who play year around.<br /><br />\nnovember 3, 1972/news-letter/page 15<br /><br />\nBlack Hawks and Canadiens to lead NHL<br />\nEd. note: With the National<br />\nHockey League season well under<br />\nway now,the News - Letter<br />\nthought it would be interesting<br />\nto provide the following team by<br />\nteam anaysis and predictions:<br /><br />\nPittsburgh - The Penguins have<br />\nClippers last year.

The team is<br />\nbunch of players played for the<br />\nquite superior to the other six<br />\nbut just not in Chicago's class.<br />\nPrediction: 2nd.<br />\nDa Blues<br />\nSt. Louis. The Blues have bad<br />\ngoaltending but are solid<br />\neverywhere else. The defense will<br />\nstop their opponents from<br />\nscoring too much and the<br />\noffense, behind Gary Unger and<br />\nthe O'Shea brothers,will score<br />\noften enough to put St. Louis<br />\n3004 Huntington Ave.<br />\ninto the playoffs. Prediction: 3rd_<br /><br />\nstill injured. Phil Esposito is a<br />\nmagnificent scorer and his line,<br />\nconsisting of Wayne Cashman<br />\nand Ken Hodge,is the best in the<br />\nleague. When Orr returns, the<br />\nBruins will be good enough.<br />\nPrediction: 2nd<br />\nDetroit - If their goaltending<br />\nholds up, the Red Wings should<br />\npass New York this year. Roy<br />\nEdwards is good but oft -injured.<br />\nGary Bergman, Marcel Diomne,<br />\nMickey Redmond, and Nick<br />\nLibbett are the nucleus of an<br />\nexcellent team. Prediction: 3rd<br />\nNew York Rangers - The<br />\nRangers are in danger of not even<br /><br />\nmaking the playoffs. Ed<br />\nGiacomin is highly overrated and<br />\nGilles Villemure lacks the<br />\nstamina to play a full season.<br />\nBrad Park is a great offenseman<br />\nwho tends to forget he is<br />\nsupposed to play defense. Rod<br />\nSeiling was awful for Team<br />\nCanada and Jim Nielson is always<br />\ninjured. The only bright spots of<br />\nthe team are the GAG line of<br />\nGilbert, Ratelle and Hadfield,<br />\nand the play of Walt Tkackuk<br />\nand Pete Stemkowski.<br />\nPrediction: 4th<br />\nTo be continued in following issue<br /><br />\nsports briefs<br />\ncross - country team travels to<br />\nPhiladelphia to participate in the<br />\nMAC championships, against<br />\nsuch strong conference teams as<br />\nSwartmore, Franklin and<br /><br />\nMarshall, Juniata.

This<br />\nweek's NewsNews<br />\nweek had<br />\narrived early (or Analysis<br />\nperhaps finally<br />\non time) with<br />\nlong reports of the impending<br />\n\"peace\" in Vietnam and the<br />\nupcoming elections. Having had<br />\nenough of the current rhetoric on<br />\npeace, I turned to page 40 to see<br />\nthis newsweekly's pre-election<br />\nanalysis. I wish I would had stuck<br />\nto peace.<br />\nPre-election analysis is sticky<br />\nbusiness. The analyst is dealing<br />\nwith polls that can be refuted<br />\nwith other polls; opinions that<br />\ncan be \"out-facted\" by other<br />\nopinions; information that can be<br />\n\"out-sourced\" by other<br />\ninformation. In the end, what is<br />\nsaid before an election is of<br />\nnegligible importance compared<br />\nto what is said following. But the<br />\npublic demands analysis before<br />\nthe fact, as they demand that<br />\nWalter Cronkite tell us who the<br />\nnext president is by 7:30 within<br />\n1 percent of the vote counted.<br />\nAnyone can analyze an election<br />\nbefore it takes place and their<br />\npredictions are just as reliable<br />\nand \"valid\" as Newsweek 's or<br />\nTom Wicker's.<br />\nThe tone of this election was<br />\nunfortunately set when Toni<br />\nEagleton was dropped from the<br />\nDemocratic ticket as the Vice<br />\nPresidential nominee. Everytime<br />\nthat affair is dragged through the<br />\nmud (even today the columnists<br />\nwrite about it) a disservice to the<br />\ncampaign and the country is<br />\nperformed. I even regret<br />\nmentioning the \"Eagleton<br />\nAffair\"now, but a clarification is<br />\nneeded. If, as the argument goes,<br />\nSenator Eagleton was left on the<br />\nticket, his health would have<br />\nbeen an issue throughout the<br />\ncampaign. Eagleton was dropped,<br />\nas demanded, and a thorough<br />\ndiscussion of the issues was<br />\nexpected to follow.<br />\nUnfortunately, this hasn't<br />\nhappened at all. The press has<br />\nused the \"Eagleton Affair\" and<br />\nsubsequent \"mind changes\" by<br />\nSenator McGovern as an excuse<br />\nfor not presenting the issues<br />\nsquarely before the people.<br />\nNewsweek 's analysis, which lacks<br />\nany comment on the issues, is a<br />\nglaring example of the<br />\nperformance of the majority of<br />\nthe media, who have focused<br />\nprimarily on the personalities,<br />\nfaults, attributes of the candidate<br />\nand the incumbent. The<br />\neconomy, welfare reform, health<br />\ninsurance, defense spending,<br />\ncorruption, and other problems<br />\nwhich will become blackheads on<br />\nthe face of America in the next<br />\nfour years have been virtually<br />\nignored. Only a few papers and<br />\nnetworks have shed light in the<br />\ntunnel that the media and the<br />\nincumbent are leading us<br />\nthrough.<br />\nThe press is by no means<br />\nentirely to blame. The media's<br />\nprimary responsibility is to<br />\nreport what the candidates are<br />\nsaying and discussing Lin addresses<br />\nbefore the people. Regardless of<br /><br />\none's bias, one must admit that<br />\nthere has been no real discuaaion<br />\nbetween the candidates in this<br />\n,campaign. Discussion implies<br />\ndialogue between two parties of<br />\nwhich we have seen none.<br />\nSenator McGovern should be<br />\ncommended for addressing<br />\nhimself to the'fundamental issues<br />\nbefore us. He has been hampered,<br />\nthough, by no response from the<br />\nincumbent. We have seen ,him<br />\ntalking to an empty chair. No<br />\ncandidate has campaigned as<br />\nlittle as Richard Nixon since<br />\nWarren Harding. This, by itself,<br />\nhas blocked any possibility for a<br />\ngood campaign or a good<br />\nelection.<br />\nI have prefaced this analysis<br />\nwith a look at the campaign<br />\nbecause, obviously, the election<br />\nis a direct result of the campaign.<br />\nHence, if you don't have a good<br />\ncampaign, you can't have a good<br />\nelection. Regardless of the<br />\nwinner, I view this campaign as<br /><br />\none that hopefully will not be<br />\nrepeated for years to come.<br />\nAny pre-election analysis must<br />\nrely heavily on the polls, so. as<br />\nmuch as I wish I could, I cannot<br />\ndeviate from this norm. But there<br />\nis one nice rule about polls<br />\nthey can be used to interpret<br />\nopposite conclusions. I will<br />\nemploy this \"rule of opposite<br />\nconclusions\" liberally in the next<br />\nfew paragraphs.<br />\nThere are four sets of data<br />\n\u2018vhich are of interest in the<br />\nclosing week of this campaign.<br />\nThe last New York<br />\nTimeslYankelovich poll gives<br />\nNixon 56% and McGovern 30%<br />\nof the vote. The 'latest Gallup<br />\npoll has Nixon receiving 59% of'<br />\nthe vote and McGovern 36%. The<br />\naggegate count of Newsweek 's six<br />\nkey states (California, Illinois,<br />\nMichigan, New York. Ohio. and<br />\nPennsylvania) is 57% - 38% with<br />\nNixon again the leader. The key<br />\npoll (for this analysis) is a recent<br /><br />\nSindlinger poll suggesting that<br />\nonly 59% of Nixon's backers plan<br />\nto vote while 91% of the.<br />\nMcGovern prospects plan to pull<br />\nthe lever. If this data is accurate<br />\nWe can interpolate the figures<br />\ninto the other polls and come up<br />\nwith perhaps more accurate<br />\nresults.<br />\nWhen we compute the<br />\nTimes/Yankehmich poll we find<br />\nthings have changed a lot - 47%<br />\nfor Nixon and 38% for McGovern<br />\nwith a large percentage<br />\nundecided. A new Gallup poll<br />\nworks out to 49.7% for Nixon<br />\nand 46.8% for McGovern. The .<br />\nelection gets closer yet.<br />\nNewsweek 's six state poll. with<br />\nthe Sindlinger influence tips in<br />\nfavor of McGovern who recieves<br />\n49.4%. of the vote to Nixon's<br />\n48%. All you McGovern<br />\nsupporters should not start<br />\nproclaiming victory. These<br />\nfigures are largely conjecture and<br />\na re based solely on the accuracy<br /><br />\nNixon stumps in key Senate races<br />\nPresident Nixon's plans to<br />\nstump this weekend in several<br />\nstates with key Senate races may<br />\nwell indicate that Republican<br />\ncontrol of the next Senate is<br />\nfarther from reality than most<br />\nRepublican soothsayers once<br />\nprojected.<br />\nNixon will travel to Rhode<br />\nIsland, Oklahoma, North<br />\nCarolina, and New Mexico before<br />\nretreating to the Western White<br />\nHouse for election day. Each of<br />\nthese states have Senate seats<br />\nRepublicans are banking on for<br />\ncontrol in the 93rd upper house.<br />\nOff 33 Senate seats up for<br />\ncontention, Republicans now<br />\nhold 19, and need a net gain of 6<br />\n(or five if Nixon wins re-election<br />\nallowing Vice-President Spiro<br />\nAgnew to break a 50-50 tie) .<br />\nLast week Nixon stopped over<br />\nin Kentucky to aid former<br />\nRepublican Governor Louie<br />\nNunn,who now has the edge over<br />\nDemocratic state house majority<br />\nleader Walter Huddleson.<br />\nRe tiring Re publican Senator<br />\nJohn Sherman Cooper's seat<br />\nmust be won by Nunn for<br />\nRepublican hopes to stay alive.<br />\nLatest polls give Nunn a 2<br />\npercent lead with more than 20<br />\npercent undecided.<br />\nAhead<br />\nIn Rhode Island, the state's<br />\nlargest newspaper published a<br />\npoll yesterday showing<br />\nDemocratic incumbent Claiborne<br />\nPell ahead of former Governor<br />\nJohn Chafee 42 - 40 with 18<br />\nPercent undecided. The<br />\nProvidence Journal poll had<br />\nearlier shown. Chafee a 2 -1<br />\nfavorite. The race is still too close<br />\nto call, but significant in the<br />\npoll's findings is a substantial<br />\nreturn of Democrats to the fold<br />\nin the Senate races. The Chafee<br />\nfamily owns 50 percent of the<br />\nJournal and editors are planning<br />\nto endorse one of the two<br />\ncandidates this Sunday; In<br />\nOklahoma, whose Senator Fred<br />\nHarris briefly a presidential<br />\ncandidate retired after one term,<br />\nTulsa oil executive and former<br />\nRepublican Governor Dewey<br />\nBartlet is giving slightly favored<br /><br />\nCongressman Ed 1::dinondson<br />\nstiff challenge.

Everett<br />\nJordon in North Carolina's senate<br />\nprimary, leads a conservative<br />\nRepublican challenger Jesse<br />\nHelms. Helms, who earlier this<br />\nyear criticized Nixon for<br />\n\"appeasing Red China\" is<br />\nreaching out for his coattails.<br /><br />\nThe contest for Democratic<br />\nSenator Clinton Anderson'S seat<br />\nin New Mexico is as close as the<br />\nPell - Chafee race. Democrat Jack<br />\nDaniels and Republican Pete<br />\nDomenici are neck and neck in a<br />\nstate Nixon lost in 1960 and won<br />\nin '68, though some observers<br />\nhave given Domenici a slight<br />\nedge.<br />\nThe President will jump<br />\nheadlong into these four Senate<br />\nraces t od ay and tomorrow,<br />\nextending his coattails the extra<br />\ninches that inay yield votes for<br />\nGOP candidates from traditional<br />\nDemocrats dissatisfied with the<br />\nMcGovern party. Just how<br />\ndeeply Nixon's appeal extends<br />\nbelow the Presidential level<br />\nremains to be seen.<br />\nThe President's avoidance of<br />\nthe Texas Senais facing a tough<br />\nrace against Connally supported<br />\nDe m oc rat Barefoot Saunders,<br />\nindicates the careful<br />\norchestration of the whole<br />\nRepublican effort in 1972.<br /><br />\nof the Sindlinger poll which is<br />\nsubject to as much questioning as<br />\nany other poll. But these new<br />\nfigures do point to an election<br />\nmuch tighter than Newsweek and<br />\nmost others would have us<br />\nbelieve. In the end, a landslide or<br />\na close election hinges primarily<br />\non voter interpretation of the<br />\nother article in this week's<br />\nNelvsweek.<br />\nConventional wisdom tells us<br />\nthat any major foreign policy<br />\ninitiative by an incumbent<br />\nPresident running for reelection<br />\nis good for several points in the<br />\npolls. The latest Harris poll seems<br />\nto confirm this rule. However,<br />\nthe rule of opposite conclusions<br />\nagain rears its ugly head. The<br />\npeace initiative can do several<br />\nthings. First, it can appear as a<br />\npurely political move on the part<br />\nof the President. Second, voters<br />\nmight wonder, as does George<br />\nMcGovern, why the settlement<br />\ndidn't come four years ago. ABC<br />\nNews found both these<br />\ninterpretations prevalent in their<br />\n.All -American city, Columbus,<br />\nOhio. The third important<br />\nviewpoint is that voters will now<br />\nsee the election in more<br />\ntraditional economic terms, now<br />\nthat the war is apparently really<br />\nending. Here McGovern has the<br />\nedge in the polls and voters may<br />\nnow turn to him. Again, these<br />\nare only<br />\nin<br />\nconjecture, but then any<br />\npre -el cc lion analysis is. These<br />\nfactors do, however, indicate we<br />\nmay see a closer election Tuesday<br />\nnight.<br />\nAfter all the polls are taken,<br />\nonly one will mean anything at<br />\nall<br />\nthe election on November<br />\n7. If Mr. Nixon wins in a<br />\nlandslide, I reserve the right to be<br />\nwrong and chalk it up to<br />\n\"statistical error\" and admitted<br />\noptimism. If I am correct and it<br />\nis a close election, I claim the<br />\nprediction now and chalk it up to<br />\nkeen analysis, admitted optimism<br />\nand, most of all, pure luck. At<br />\nany rate, I won't be turning the<br />\ntubes off at 7:30 on Tuesday<br />\nnight.
