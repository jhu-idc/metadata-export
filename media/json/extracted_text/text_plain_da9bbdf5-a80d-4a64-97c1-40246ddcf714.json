Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium on \"The Question of'<br />\nFreedom.\"<br />\nPresented with the question of<br />\nwhether the free enterprise<br />\nsystem can meet the demands of<br />\na modern society, Professor<br />\nLeontief said that in his<br />\npresentation he would prefer<br />\nsimply to outline the various<br />\nissues raised, rather than attempt<br />\nany answer. This he did only too<br />\nwell. His cautious approach to<br />\nthe subject resulted in a lecture<br />\nthat suffered from a distressing<br />\nlack of originality and substance.<br />\nHe neglected to address a number<br />\nof important issues and<br />\nassumptions of the free<br />\nenterprise system and seemed<br />\nreluctant to provide any policy<br />\nsuggestions for the system's<br />\noperation.<br />\nResearch<br />\nProfessor Leontief began by<br />\nreferring to a United Nations<br />\nSponsored research project in<br />\nwhich h?.. had participated. The<br />\nresearch was supposed to<br />\nestimate the prospects for the<br />\nfuture development of the world<br />\neconomy. The study argued that<br />\nii was theoretically possible for<br />\nthe world's economic output and<br />\n<br />\nliving standards to coritinue to<br />\nincrease, even in the face of<br />\nskyrocketing population growth.<br />\nAlso seen as technically feasible<br />\nunder the free enterprise system<br />\nwas the achievement by the less<br />\ndeveloped countries of growth<br />\nrates high enough so that the<br />\ngross rich-poor disparity of<br />\ntoday's world could be<br />\nsignificantly decreased during the<br />\nnext generation.<br />\nBut technical viability does<br />\nnot reality make, as Dr. Leontief<br />\nlater pointed out. He asserted<br />\nthat, in the absence of any<br />\nsubstantial alteration of the<br />\nnormal practices of the<br />\ninternational free market,<br />\nimprovement was likely only for<br />\nthose select few of the poorer<br />\ncountries who enjoy a bountiful<br />\nsupply of desirable natural<br />\nresources. He was as inescapable<br />\nthe conclusion that, in general,<br />\nthe contrast between the<br />\ndeveloped and the less developed<br />\n<br />\ncountries will not diminish, but<br />\nrather will increase, in the future<br />\nif economic activity continues as<br />\nit has in years past.<br />\nAlthough this judgment might<br />\ndraw criticism from the<br />\nconservative, William Simon type<br />\nof economist-, it certainly is<br />\ndefensible. As time goes on, it is<br />\nbecoming increasingly obvious<br />\nthat the Western industrial<br />\nnations' development efforts<br />\nhave not been conducive to the\u2022<br />\ncuring of the ills of the world's<br />\npoor countries. If anything, the<br />\nseverity of Third World problems<br />\nsuch as hunger, inequality, and<br />\nunemployment has increased<br />\nsince World War II.<br />\nMany explanations for this<br />\naid regularly been used for<br />\nmilitary and political purposes,<br />\nrather than for humanitarian<br />\nones. (Check out the tremendous<br />\namounts of United States aid<br />\ngiven to South Vietnam during<br />\nthe peak war years.) Assistance<br />\n<br />\nhas too often taken the band-aid<br />\napproach rather than trying to<br />\nattack the sturctural problems<br />\nthat perpetuate<br />\nunderdevelopment hroughout the<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe list continues. Yet<br />\nProfessor Leontief did not<br />\ndiscuss any of the reasons for<br />\nenterprise's past and alleged<br />\nfuture failure to encourage<br />\ndevelopment. Nor did he<br />\ncomment on the importance of<br />\nthis failure in judging the<br />\ndisirability of a \" free market.<br />\nShould we really be content with<br />\na system that fails to address<br />\nsuccessfully the problems of<br />\nThird World underdevelopment?<br />\nIt is unfortunate that Dr.<br />\nLeontief neglected .to evaluate<br />\nmore critically an issue so crucial<br />\nto today's interdependent world.<br />\nProfessor Leontief continued<br />\nby talking about the issue of<br />\nState intervention in the free<br />\n<br />\nmarket mechanism. Likening it<br />\nto a computer, Leontief<br />\nsuggested that the free market<br />\noperates largely by trial and<br />\nerror.

A coach's<br />\nability to attract the finest high<br />\nschool athletes to attend his<br />\ninstitution will enable him to<br />\nbuild and maintain a winning<br />\ntradition.<br />\nHow is recruiting done at<br />\nJHU? Who is recruited? Why do<br />\nathletes eventually come to<br />\nHomewood? What are the<br />\nproblems facing these athletes?<br />\nTo answer these and other<br />\nquestions, the author has talked<br />\nto people at the University<br />\ninvolved in these different phases<br />\nof recruiting.<br />\nToday's article deals with how<br />\ncoaches do their actual<br />\nrecruiting. Those interviewed<br />\nwere lacrosse coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone, swim coach Frank<br />\nComfort, football coach Dennis<br />\nCox and basketball coach Gary<br />\nRupert.)<br />\nOnce a coach has determined<br />\nwhich high school athletes are<br />\nacademically acceptable for entry<br />\nIn JHU and which of those<br />\nstudents he would most like to<br />\nsee in a Hopkins uniform, his job<br />\nas a recruiter is just beginning.<br />\nFor it is now up to the coach<br />\nto make it clear to the young<br />\nman that JHU is interested in<br />\nhim and then to convince the<br />\nrecruit that, scholastically,<br />\nathletically or otherwise, Johns<br />\n<br />\nhearing of a possible Blue Jay<br />\nswimmer, the coach will write a<br />\nletter to the student and await a<br />\nreply.<br />\n\"If the person writes back, I<br />\nknow he's interested,\" Comfort<br />\nexplained. \"If, on the other<br />\nhand, I get no response, I'll<br />\nassume he's not interested in<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\n\"Coach Dennis Cox follows<br />\nthe same type of procedure while<br />\nrecruiting football players. The<br />\nfirst contact with the athlete is a<br />\nletter and an information sheet<br />\nto be returned to Hopkins.<br />\n\"If the player sends the sheet<br />\nback,\" the Coach noted, \"I will<br />\nassume he is interested and will<br />\nmake a personal inquiry.\"<br />\nUnlike other coaches, the first<br />\ncontact between basketball<br />\nmentor Gary Rupert and his<br />\nprospective athletes is usually a<br />\npersonal one.

JHU has become<br />\nsynonomous with the sport and<br />\nthe Coach need only refer to the<br />\nremarkable feeling around<br />\nHomewood in the spring to show<br />\nthe importance that lacrosse still<br />\ncommands.<br />\n<br />\nThat the Hopkins swim team<br />\nhas been ranked in the nation's<br />\ntop ten of Division III in each of<br />\nthe last six years attests to the<br />\nexcellence of the program and is<br />\na fact that Coach Comfort can<br />\npoint to to attract swimmers to<br />\nHomewood.

If the team had<br />\nbeen able to cash in on all the<br />\nopportunities they were afforded<br />\nin the game, the score could have<br />\nbeen a rout in Hopkins' favor.<br />\nEarly in the first half, the<br />\noffense shifted into high gear,<br />\nexerting a great deal of pressure<br />\non the Widener defense. In one<br />\ninstance, a Jay back led forward<br />\nGreg Cunningham into a clear<br />\nbreakaway with a pin point pass<br />\npast the outstretched legs of<br />\nWidener defenders. The threat,<br />\nthough, fell through when<br />\n<br />\nCunningham shot the ball wide<br />\nof the net.<br />\nAnother strong opportunity<br />\ncame minutes later through the<br />\nefforts of the successful scoring<br />\nteam of back Steve Galloway and<br />\nlineman Larry McGowan which<br />\naccounted for the last two goals<br />\nof Saturday's game against<br />\nFranklin and Marshall. Galloway<br />\nwas able to work the ball down<br />\nthe right side of the field.<br />\nFinding McGowan free across the<br />\nfield, Galloway fed him a sharp<br />\npass. With the entire cage to<br />\nshoot at, McGowan fired for the<br />\nupper corner of the net. The<br />\nWidener goalie, though, was able<br />\nto just tip the ball over the upper<br />\nbar for the save. As the half<br />\nended, the game was scoreless.<br />\nHopkins didn't wait long to go<br />\ntop in the second half. With just<br />\na few minutes gone, Larry<br />\nMcGowan fired a fifteen yard<br />\nshot right on the goalie who was<br />\nunable to corral the rebound. An<br />\nalert Chaim Levin took the loose<br />\nball and put it in the net for the<br />\n1-0 lead.<br />\nSenior co-captain Tom Myrick<br />\nended the day's scoring toward<br />\nthe game's conclusion when he<br />\nconnected on a hard twenty yard<br />\nshot that found its way past the<br />\nopposing goal tender.<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays missed two more<br />\ngoals in the second half literally<br />\nby inches. A McGowan shot<br />\nheaded for the net was<br />\nmiraculously kicked out by a<br />\ndefender just as it touched the<br />\ngoal line. In another case, senior<br />\nco-captain Gary Ignatowski fired<br />\na shot from close range only to<br />\nhave it stopped by the goalie<br />\nwith a brilliant save.<br />\nGoalie Ken Suesse and the<br />\ndefense, especially sweeper back<br />\nFrank Olszewski, were in top<br />\nform and showed their excellence<br />\nin certain times of the game. The<br />\ndefensive play of the game came<br />\nwhen Suesse broke up a two on<br />\none Widener break by coming<br />\nout of the net to stop a strong<br />\nshot with a beautiful maneuver.<br />\n\"I am very pleased with our<br />\nperformance here today,\" said<br />\nCoach Oliver. \"Widener was<br />\nreally up for the game and it was<br />\na tough contest.\"<br />\nThe Jays have now improved<br />\ntheir record to 4-3-1, but more<br />\nimportantly, to 3-1 in their<br />\nleague.

The SAC was just<br />\nbeginning to develop its playland<br />\nsocial calendar of weekend films<br />\nand pancake brunches and there<br />\nwas no live music to be found.<br />\nBut on any given day of the week<br />\nthere were these guys who sat on<br />\nthe benches in the freshman quad<br />\nplaying guitars and singing. Their<br />\nemphasis was heavily on the<br />\nGrateful Dead and the Band,<br />\nwith a few lesser-known Van<br />\nMorrison and Rolling Stones<br />\ntunes thrown in. But you'd walk<br />\nby those benches sometimes and<br />\nhear things by Moby Grape, Sam<br />\nCooke or Ray Charles and you<br />\nknew these guys were special.<br />\nTaste, I believe it's called.<br />\nIn November of that year the<br />\nfirst Ocean Rose show was held<br />\nupstairs in Levering Hall.<br />\nSuddenly, the school had good<br />\nmusic and no reason not to<br />\ndance. The response was<br />\npandemonium, Hopkins-style.<br />\nWith the help of enlightened<br />\ndespots like Andy Savitz and<br />\nJohn Coliners, there were Ocean<br />\nRose concerts both indoor and<br />\noutdoor, day and night.<br />\nAn interesting thing happened<br />\nalong the way. In addition to<br />\ntheir impeccably selected<br />\nrepertoire of standards, the band<br />\nbegan to play original<br />\ncompositions. Songs with titles<br />\nlike \"Golden French Fries,\"<br />\n\"Don't Be A Stranger- and<br />\n\"Television Joy\" appeared and<br />\nwere met with jubilation by the<br />\ngrowing numbers of Ocean Rose<br />\nregulars. The songs, written<br />\n<br />\nmostly by Milt Reder and Jimmy<br />\nOwens, were intelligent, funny<br />\nand, above all, rocking. The<br />\nelecticism displayed on the<br />\nbenches was producing some<br />\ndamned good original material .<br />\nWhen Chuch Swartley and his<br />\nsaxophone joined the group in<br />\n<br />\nthe fall of 1973, a broad, jazzy<br />\ndimension was added to the<br />\nmusic. The originals were coming<br />\nfast and furious and each show<br />\ndrew larger and larger crowds.<br />\nThere were times when Black<br />\nRose, a band comprised of three<br />\n<br />\nof Milt's friends, would make the<br />\ntrip down from New York to<br />\nplay a double bill and the<br />\nresulting energy levels were<br />\nsimply astounding. Kindred<br />\nspirits and solid musicianship all<br />\nthe way around made those<br />\noccasions truly memorable.<br />\n<br />\nConflict<br />\nWhat followed for Ocean Rose<br />\nwere the shakeups in personnel<br />\nthat are to be expected in any<br />\nmusical partnership, especailly<br />\none formed in as transient a<br />\n<br />\nlocation as a college campus. But<br />\nthe most frustrating circumstance<br />\nof all was the basic conflict<br />\nbetween going to school and<br />\nplaying music. Scheduling<br />\npractice between chemistry<br />\nexams and GRE's has never<br />\nworked and that is ultimately<br />\n<br />\nwhat kept Ocean Rose from<br />\nachieving anything other than its<br />\nstatus as the resident Hopkins<br />\nband. It was as simple as that.<br />\nThe problem was painfully<br />\nobvious to all involved and some<br />\ndecisions and sacrifices had to be<br />\n<br />\nmade. Less than three months<br />\nago, Jimmy, Milt and Chuck left<br />\nBaltimore for Boston to 'join<br />\nforces with Bill Lane and Jon<br />\nGould, the Black Rose rhythm<br />\nsection, and Bruce Katcz, Ocean<br />\nRose's original pianist. With them<br />\nwent Clayton Blick,. who<br />\nengineers their sound and has<br />\nprovided them with a place to<br />\npractice.<br />\nThe group had its debut last<br />\nSaturday night at the West<br />\nRosbury Softball Association's<br />\nannual dinner and dance. There<br />\nwere 1,000 people that night in<br />\nFlorian Hall (softball being the<br />\nbiggest thing to hit Root Park<br />\nsince beer in zip-top cans) and it<br />\nreally had to be seen to be<br />\nbelieved. After an adequate<br />\nbeginning, the band suddenly<br />\ncame alive about halfway<br />\nthrough and the poeple were still<br />\nscreaming and stomping for more<br />\nwhen the management turned the<br />\nlights up at 1:30 a.m.<br />\nThe songlist reads like a small<br />\nanthology of rhythm and blues<br />\nclassics, featuring numbers like<br />\n\"Road Runner,\" \"634-5789\"<br />\nand \"Hunter Gets Captured By<br />\nThe Game\" and originals like<br />\n\"Smiles Lightning\" and \"Girl<br />\nWith the Red Bandana\" never<br />\nsounded so good.

Thinking that<br />\nour impressive Rathskellar would<br />\nprovide a wholesome night of<br />\nentertainment, I proudly brought<br />\nmy friends to campus.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium on \"The Question of'<br />\nFreedom.\"<br />\nPresented with the question of<br />\nwhether the free enterprise<br />\nsystem can meet the demands of<br />\na modern society, Professor<br />\nLeontief said that in his<br />\npresentation he would prefer<br />\nsimply to outline the various<br />\nissues raised, rather than attempt<br />\nany answer. This he did only too<br />\nwell. His cautious approach to<br />\nthe subject resulted in a lecture<br />\nthat suffered from a distressing<br />\nlack of originality and substance.<br />\nHe neglected to address a number<br />\nof important issues and<br />\nassumptions of the free<br />\nenterprise system and seemed<br />\nreluctant to provide any policy<br />\nsuggestions for the system's<br />\noperation.<br />\nResearch<br />\nProfessor Leontief began by<br />\nreferring to a United Nations<br />\nSponsored research project in<br />\nwhich h?.. had participated. The<br />\nresearch was supposed to<br />\nestimate the prospects for the<br />\nfuture development of the world<br />\neconomy. The study argued that<br />\nii was theoretically possible for<br />\nthe world's economic output and<br /><br />\nliving standards to coritinue to<br />\nincrease, even in the face of<br />\nskyrocketing population growth.<br />\nAlso seen as technically feasible<br />\nunder the free enterprise system<br />\nwas the achievement by the less<br />\ndeveloped countries of growth<br />\nrates high enough so that the<br />\ngross rich-poor disparity of<br />\ntoday's world could be<br />\nsignificantly decreased during the<br />\nnext generation.<br />\nBut technical viability does<br />\nnot reality make, as Dr. Leontief<br />\nlater pointed out. He asserted<br />\nthat, in the absence of any<br />\nsubstantial alteration of the<br />\nnormal practices of the<br />\ninternational free market,<br />\nimprovement was likely only for<br />\nthose select few of the poorer<br />\ncountries who enjoy a bountiful<br />\nsupply of desirable natural<br />\nresources. He was as inescapable<br />\nthe conclusion that, in general,<br />\nthe contrast between the<br />\ndeveloped and the less developed<br /><br />\ncountries will not diminish, but<br />\nrather will increase, in the future<br />\nif economic activity continues as<br />\nit has in years past.<br />\nAlthough this judgment might<br />\ndraw criticism from the<br />\nconservative, William Simon type<br />\nof economist-, it certainly is<br />\ndefensible. As time goes on, it is<br />\nbecoming increasingly obvious<br />\nthat the Western industrial<br />\nnations' development efforts<br />\nhave not been conducive to the\u2022<br />\ncuring of the ills of the world's<br />\npoor countries. If anything, the<br />\nseverity of Third World problems<br />\nsuch as hunger, inequality, and<br />\nunemployment has increased<br />\nsince World War II.<br />\nMany explanations for this<br />\naid regularly been used for<br />\nmilitary and political purposes,<br />\nrather than for humanitarian<br />\nones. (Check out the tremendous<br />\namounts of United States aid<br />\ngiven to South Vietnam during<br />\nthe peak war years.) Assistance<br /><br />\nhas too often taken the band-aid<br />\napproach rather than trying to<br />\nattack the sturctural problems<br />\nthat perpetuate<br />\nunderdevelopment hroughout the<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe list continues. Yet<br />\nProfessor Leontief did not<br />\ndiscuss any of the reasons for<br />\nenterprise's past and alleged<br />\nfuture failure to encourage<br />\ndevelopment. Nor did he<br />\ncomment on the importance of<br />\nthis failure in judging the<br />\ndisirability of a \" free market.<br />\nShould we really be content with<br />\na system that fails to address<br />\nsuccessfully the problems of<br />\nThird World underdevelopment?<br />\nIt is unfortunate that Dr.<br />\nLeontief neglected .to evaluate<br />\nmore critically an issue so crucial<br />\nto today's interdependent world.<br />\nProfessor Leontief continued<br />\nby talking about the issue of<br />\nState intervention in the free<br /><br />\nmarket mechanism. Likening it<br />\nto a computer, Leontief<br />\nsuggested that the free market<br />\noperates largely by trial and<br />\nerror. There is a constant search<br />\nfor the amounts of production,<br />\nmoney supply, inflation, and<br />\nunemployment that will result in<br />\neconomic equilibrium. While ne<br />\npraised the \"Invisible hand\" of<br />\nthe free market for working so<br />\nwell, Leontief said that<br />\ngovernmental guidance is usually<br />\nnecessary to maintain a<br />\nprosperous economy. \"Our<br />\neconomic system,\" he said,<br />\n\"which is marvelous . . . must bo<br />\nwatched.\"<br />\nSuch governmental<br />\n\"meddling\" is necessary in order<br />\nto avoid such problems as<br />\nrecurring depressions and<br />\nunnecessary duplication of<br />\nproduction (e.g., police forces for<br />\neach citizen). The trick of such<br />\nintervention, according to<br />\nLeontief, is to utilize thc forces<br />\nof self-interest and private<br />\ninitiative. By mixing these<br />\ningredients in the proper<br />\namounts, the free market system<br />\ncan be made to respond better to<br />\nthe diesires of the society.<br />\nImplicit in Leontief's<br />\nargument in favor of a free<br />\nmarket are some critical<br />\nassumptions that deserve<br />\nscrutiny. Two such crucial issues<br />\nare free choice and value<br />\nformation under free enr2rprise.<br />\nThese issues are central to the<br />\nphilosophy of a free market and<br />\nshould he understood in order to<br />\nevaluate' the pros and cons of the<br />\nsystem However, Leontier chose<br />\nto skirt these points.<br /><br />\npage 4/news-lettedoctober 29,1976<br /><br />\nJudgin' with J.D.<br /><br />\nRay and Cleo combine for dynamite Porgy and Bess<br />\nAmerica has some rather<br />\npeculiar musical beliefs.

The Black Student<br />\nUnion (BSU) had moved for the<br />\nancellation on the grounds the<br />\novie was \"offensive and<br />\ninflammatory.\"<br />\nOver two hundred concerned<br />\nstudents, mostly members of the<br />\nBSU, watched and participated in<br />\na debate that lasted for ninety<br />\nminutes.<br />\nMembers of the BSU and film<br />\nseries were asked by the SC for<br />\ntheir opposing stances on the<br />\nfilm. Main Hawkins,spokesman<br />\nfor the BSU, told the audience<br />\nthat the BSU and other members<br />\nof the Hopkins community were<br />\noffended by the depictions of<br />\nminority characters in the film,<br />\nparticularly blacks.<br />\nSpeaking directly to the<br />\ncouncil, Hawkins added, \"We're<br />\nan important minority on this<br />\ncampus and we feel we should be<br />\nrepresented. The BSU has been<br />\nneglected in the past. By voting<br />\nto ban this film, you can help<br />\npatch up the relationship.\"<br />\nthat \"Coonskin.\"is a racist film.<br />\nThe BSU was, in essence, asking<br />\nthe Council to decide whether or<br />\nnot they were going to sponsor a<br />\nracist film. However, I was<br />\nunable to get any specific<br />\nargument to substantiate the<br />\nclaims made about \"Coonskin.\"<br />\nMembers of the BSU\u2014 7 in<br />\nall)\u2014who were given a private<br />\nscreening of the film told myself<br />\nand the others present about<br />\nstereotypes of black characters in<br />\nthe film, but would not mention<br />\nanything about how whites were<br />\nportrayed or what happened to<br />\nthese characters. Were there<br />\n\"good guys\" and \"bad guys?\" In<br />\nthe end, did the whites triumph<br />\nover the blacks? Or what? I was<br />\noffended that such a lack of<br />\nspecificity was considered<br />\nsufficient to sustain an argument.<br />\n(Perhaps the Student Council is<br />\nat fault here, also, for accepting<br />\nthis \"proof.\")<br />\nDuring the debate, one of the<br />\nFilm Series organizers, Jennifer<br />\nBishop, was subjected to a very<br />\naggressive interrogation by a<br />\ngentleman who mocked and<br />\nbullied her in a very<br />\nungentlemanly manner. I am<br />\naware that things were extremely<br />\nemotional (although I believe<br />\nsuch passion hindered a fair<br />\ndiscussion), but I was deeply<br />\noffended that someone who<br />\nclaimed he was making a plea for<br />\nhuman dignity on a large scale<br />\ncould have so little respect for it<br />\nhimself on the personal level.<br />\nFinally, I was insulted by the<br />\nrationale put forth by several<br />\npersons in favor of the BSU<br />\ndemands that white students<br />\nwould not be able to understand<br />\nthat the film was using satirical<br />\ncaricatures, and not portraying<br />\nreal-life people. It was flatly<br />\nstated that the average white<br />\nstudent has \"no idea\" of what<br /><br />\nJennifer Bishop, representative<br />\nof the film series countered that<br />\nbanning the film amounts to<br />\nprior censorship by the council.<br />\n\"The majority of students on<br />\ncampus haven't even seen the<br />\nfilm yet. We think they should be<br />\ngiven that chance.\" Bishop also<br />\nc ntended, consistent with<br />\nstatements issued by the film's<br />\ncreator Ralph Bakshi, that the<br />\nfilm overdramatizes sterotypes of<br />\nminorities to make a satirical<br />\nstatement condemning racism.<br />\n\"Film critics have praised the<br />\nfilm. There is no substantial<br />\nevidence that the film is racist,\"<br />\nshe said.<br />\nIn addition, she said the film is<br />\na unique work of art, combining<br />\nanimation with realism.<br />\nBishop was one of the few<br />\nsupporters of showing the film<br />\nwho attended the emergency SC<br />\nmeeting, however, and her views<br />\nwere generally not held in high<br />\nesteem by the audience, filled<br />\nwith partisans favoring the<br />\ncensoring of the film.<br />\nThe council overturned its<br />\nprevious decision after sampling<br />\nreactions from the crowd. Both<br />\nblacks and some white students<br />\nspoke against the film. One<br />\nstudent said, \"It's not a black<br />\nissue, it's a humanistic issue-- all<br />\nof us are minorities. Next time it<br />\ncould be a group you're a part<br />\nof.\"<br />\nblack people are really like and<br />\nthat their ignorance would<br />\nprevent them from being capable<br />\nof making a proper judgement<br />\nabout \"Coonskin.\"<br />\nThese charges only served to<br />\nstereotype the white students<br />\nand were really another form of<br />\nthe ugly creature the BSU said it<br />\nwas fighting: racism. The irony<br />\nis that it seems the BSU<br />\nmembers who viewed<br />\n\"Coonskin\" were the ones unable<br />\nto see beyond the so-called<br />\nstereotyping.<br />\nAll this upset me a great deal.<br />\nThe BSU was making a value<br />\njudgement for all of us, especially<br />\nmembers of the black<br />\ncommunity.\"Coonskin\" was said<br />\nto be offensive to blacks. White<br />\nstudents remarked it was<br />\noffensive to them because it was<br />\ninsulting to the black segment of<br />\nthe studentry. But most of the<br />\nblack students who attended the<br />\nmeeting had never seen<br />\n\"Coonskin\" and, at best, could<br />\nonly have had the same vague<br />\nnotion of what the movie was<br />\nabout that I had.<br />\nI was also extremely disturbed<br />\nthat black people would use the<br />\nargument of protecting the<br />\nwhites from getting certain<br />\n\"harmful\" ideas into their heads.<br />\nThis was the same logic<br />\nemployed to suppress the<br />\nint ellectual awareness of blacks<br />\nin this country for hundreds of<br />\nyears.

A coach's<br />\nability to attract the finest high<br />\nschool athletes to attend his<br />\ninstitution will enable him to<br />\nbuild and maintain a winning<br />\ntradition.<br />\nHow is recruiting done at<br />\nJHU? Who is recruited? Why do<br />\nathletes eventually come to<br />\nHomewood? What are the<br />\nproblems facing these athletes?<br />\nTo answer these and other<br />\nquestions, the author has talked<br />\nto people at the University<br />\ninvolved in these different phases<br />\nof recruiting.<br />\nToday's article deals with how<br />\ncoaches do their actual<br />\nrecruiting. Those interviewed<br />\nwere lacrosse coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone, swim coach Frank<br />\nComfort, football coach Dennis<br />\nCox and basketball coach Gary<br />\nRupert.)<br />\nOnce a coach has determined<br />\nwhich high school athletes are<br />\nacademically acceptable for entry<br />\nIn JHU and which of those<br />\nstudents he would most like to<br />\nsee in a Hopkins uniform, his job<br />\nas a recruiter is just beginning.<br />\nFor it is now up to the coach<br />\nto make it clear to the young<br />\nman that JHU is interested in<br />\nhim and then to convince the<br />\nrecruit that, scholastically,<br />\nathletically or otherwise, Johns<br /><br />\nhearing of a possible Blue Jay<br />\nswimmer, the coach will write a<br />\nletter to the student and await a<br />\nreply.<br />\n\"If the person writes back, I<br />\nknow he's interested,\" Comfort<br />\nexplained. \"If, on the other<br />\nhand, I get no response, I'll<br />\nassume he's not interested in<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\n\"Coach Dennis Cox follows<br />\nthe same type of procedure while<br />\nrecruiting football players. The<br />\nfirst contact with the athlete is a<br />\nletter and an information sheet<br />\nto be returned to Hopkins.<br />\n\"If the player sends the sheet<br />\nback,\" the Coach noted, \"I will<br />\nassume he is interested and will<br />\nmake a personal inquiry.\"<br />\nUnlike other coaches, the first<br />\ncontact between basketball<br />\nmentor Gary Rupert and his<br />\nprospective athletes is usually a<br />\npersonal one. With many<br />\nbasketball players eliminated due<br />\nto the academic requirements, his<br />\nrecruiting list is generally a<br />\nsmaller one than those of his<br />\ncolleagues, thus affording him<br />\nthis opportunity.<br />\nHowever, this is not<br />\nnecessarily an enviable position.<br />\nThis lack of possible recruits also<br /><br />\nHopkins is the place for him.<br />\nRegardless of the sport, this<br />\ninitial expression of interest<br />\nusually takes the form of a letter<br />\nto the athlete.<br />\nFor lacrosse coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone, this letter is generally<br />\nsent to the student at the end of<br />\nthe junior year. It will oftentimes<br />\ncongratulate a player who has<br />\nbeen named to an All-Star squad<br />\n(if this is applicable) and will<br />\nexplain that further<br />\ncorrespondence will follow in the<br />\nfall.<br />\nAfter the new school year<br />\nbegins, Ciccarone's methods for<br />\nrecruiting local lacrosse players<br />\nand those who live out of town<br />\ndiverge. He will invite local<br />\nplayers for a day at which time<br />\nhe may have lunch with the<br />\nyoung man and discuss Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse. These athletes are<br />\nusually familia' with JHU and<br />\nthis may be a sufficient enough<br />\nintroduction.<br />\nThose athletes living outside of<br />\nthe Baltimore area will often<br />\nreceive an invitation to visit the<br />\ncampus-one weekend during the<br />\nfall. In this way, those unfamiliar<br />\nwith Hopkins can obtain a more<br />\ncomplete view of the University<br />\nthan is possible to get in just one<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nSwimming mentor Frank<br />\nComfort also depends on the<br />\nwritten letter as a method of<br />\nintroduction to the athlete. Upon<br /><br />\nforces this personal contact in<br />\nthat the Coach has a very limited<br />\nselection and must use this<br />\nmethod of recruiting for best<br />\nresults.<br />\nFollowing this initial<br />\nexchange, each coach must now<br />\n\"sell\" Hopkins to the athletes.<br />\nHe must explain why JHU is the<br />\nschool best suited for that<br />\nparticular person.<br />\nEach coach explained that<br />\nthey rank the academic<br />\nreputation of Hopkins as the<br />\nnumber one \"selling point\".<br />\nThey stress to the athlete that an<br />\neducation is the top reason that<br />\nthey will attend college and that<br />\nJHU can provide an excellent<br />\nlearning opportunity.<br />\nBeyond agreement on that<br />\npoint, the coaches spread out and<br />\nrevealed other \"selling points\" as<br />\ndiverse as their own sports.<br />\nCoach Ciccarone, of course,<br />\ncan point to the tradition of<br />\nHopkins lacrosse excellence over<br />\nthe years. JHU has become<br />\nsynonomous with the sport and<br />\nthe Coach need only refer to the<br />\nremarkable feeling around<br />\nHomewood in the spring to show<br />\nthe importance that lacrosse still<br />\ncommands.<br /><br />\nThat the Hopkins swim team<br />\nhas been ranked in the nation's<br />\ntop ten of Division III in each of<br />\nthe last six years attests to the<br />\nexcellence of the program and is<br />\na fact that Coach Comfort can<br />\npoint to to attract swimmers to<br />\nHomewood. Also, a highly<br />\ncompetitive scheudle (eight of<br />\nthirteen meets against Division I<br />\nschools) will give these athletes a<br />\nchance to swim against a variety<br />\nof outstanding opponents.<br />\nCoach Cox also points to the<br />\noutstanding competition that<br />\nfootball players will face if they<br />\nattend Hopkins. According to the<br />\nCoach, the MAC has become \"a<br />\nvery competitive league\" and will<br />\ngive the players a chance \"to face<br />\ngood competition.\"<br />\nThe atmosphere of the<br />\nHomewood campus is what<br />\nCoach Rupert uses to help<br />\nconvince his recruits to attend<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"If a kid is considering an<br />\nacademic school and we can get<br />\nhim on campus,\" he stated, \"we<br />\nwon't lose him.\"<br />\n(Next Week: Some of<br />\nthe Recruited Athletes.)<br /><br />\nA pair of victories last<br />\nWeekend at State College, Pa. gave<br />\nthe Hopkins water polo team a<br />\nPlace in the Eastern Conference<br />\nplay-offs.<br />\nFriday night, the Jays downed<br />\nVillanova University 14-13 in<br />\ndouble overtime, while on<br />\nSaturday JHU ran roughshod<br />\nover St. Francis College 14-5.<br />\nHopkins dominated much of<br />\nthe \u2022 Villanova contest, but their<br />\noPPonents fought back to make<br />\nIt ten -all at the end of the game.<br />\nThe Wildcats scored first during<br />\novertime (the only point at<br />\nWhich they led the contest) but<br />\nHopkins quickly came back and<br />\nretook the lead. It was Hopkins<br />\n011 top fourteen-thirteen when<br />\nVillanova made their last bid, a<br />\nweak shot to the Hopkins goalie,<br />\nand the Jays ran out the clock.<br />\nThe game against Saint Francis<br />\nwas less exciting, but began too<br />\nearly in the morning for certain<br />\nc elebrating Blue Jays. The<br />\ncontest started at 9:30 a.m. and<br />\nthe sleeping Jays suddenly found<br />\nthemselves on the wrong end of a<br />\ntwo-nothing score.<br />\nHopkins' goalie woke up,<br />\nlo kedo<br />\nat the scoreboard, and<br />\ncalled a time-out. Coach Bob<br />\nSummers slapped his players<br />\naround and after that it was<br />\nHopkins all the way,ending with<br />\na score of fourteen-five.<br />\nOutstanding play was the<br />\nb yword this weekend for the<br />\nentire Hopkins team, but certain<br />\n. Players rose to the occasion far<br />\nbeyond anyone's expectations.<br />\nWhen asked who were the best<br />\nPlayers on their unit, offensive<br />\nco-captains Colin Chinn and Eric<br />\nHorning said \"Us! Us! We were<br />\nthe best!\" They finally broke<br /><br />\ndown, however, and included<br />\nRick Meyer, Bill Sick, and<br />\nfreshman surprise Bill Smiddy.<br />\nCoach Summers added that<br />\n\"Smiddy played like a crazy<br />\nman.\"<br />\nDefensive captain and goalie<br />\nSteve Audenaert, when asked to<br />\nname some outstanding<br />\ndefensemen, replied,<br />\n\"Defensemen? What<br />\nDefensemen? I was down there<br />\nall alone blocking shots right and<br />\nleft.\" It was later revealed that<br />\nsenior Matt Laskowski (the only<br />\ngraduating member of the<br />\nHopkins team), Todd Russell and<br />\nRon Wellman had earned the<br />\njoint nickname \"The Three<br />\nBears\" for their play, while<br />\nfreshman Mark \"Wolfie\"<br />\nWolfram had played \"smart, real<br />\nsmart.

If the team had<br />\nbeen able to cash in on all the<br />\nopportunities they were afforded<br />\nin the game, the score could have<br />\nbeen a rout in Hopkins' favor.<br />\nEarly in the first half, the<br />\noffense shifted into high gear,<br />\nexerting a great deal of pressure<br />\non the Widener defense. In one<br />\ninstance, a Jay back led forward<br />\nGreg Cunningham into a clear<br />\nbreakaway with a pin point pass<br />\npast the outstretched legs of<br />\nWidener defenders. The threat,<br />\nthough, fell through when<br /><br />\nCunningham shot the ball wide<br />\nof the net.<br />\nAnother strong opportunity<br />\ncame minutes later through the<br />\nefforts of the successful scoring<br />\nteam of back Steve Galloway and<br />\nlineman Larry McGowan which<br />\naccounted for the last two goals<br />\nof Saturday's game against<br />\nFranklin and Marshall. Galloway<br />\nwas able to work the ball down<br />\nthe right side of the field.<br />\nFinding McGowan free across the<br />\nfield, Galloway fed him a sharp<br />\npass. With the entire cage to<br />\nshoot at, McGowan fired for the<br />\nupper corner of the net. The<br />\nWidener goalie, though, was able<br />\nto just tip the ball over the upper<br />\nbar for the save. As the half<br />\nended, the game was scoreless.<br />\nHopkins didn't wait long to go<br />\ntop in the second half. With just<br />\na few minutes gone, Larry<br />\nMcGowan fired a fifteen yard<br />\nshot right on the goalie who was<br />\nunable to corral the rebound. An<br />\nalert Chaim Levin took the loose<br />\nball and put it in the net for the<br />\n1-0 lead.<br />\nSenior co-captain Tom Myrick<br />\nended the day's scoring toward<br />\nthe game's conclusion when he<br />\nconnected on a hard twenty yard<br />\nshot that found its way past the<br />\nopposing goal tender.<br /><br />\nThe Jays missed two more<br />\ngoals in the second half literally<br />\nby inches. A McGowan shot<br />\nheaded for the net was<br />\nmiraculously kicked out by a<br />\ndefender just as it touched the<br />\ngoal line. In another case, senior<br />\nco-captain Gary Ignatowski fired<br />\na shot from close range only to<br />\nhave it stopped by the goalie<br />\nwith a brilliant save.<br />\nGoalie Ken Suesse and the<br />\ndefense, especially sweeper back<br />\nFrank Olszewski, were in top<br />\nform and showed their excellence<br />\nin certain times of the game. The<br />\ndefensive play of the game came<br />\nwhen Suesse broke up a two on<br />\none Widener break by coming<br />\nout of the net to stop a strong<br />\nshot with a beautiful maneuver.<br />\n\"I am very pleased with our<br />\nperformance here today,\" said<br />\nCoach Oliver. \"Widener was<br />\nreally up for the game and it was<br />\na tough contest.\"<br />\nThe Jays have now improved<br />\ntheir record to 4-3-1, but more<br />\nimportantly, to 3-1 in their<br />\nleague. At this point they are in a<br />\nflat footed tie for second place<br />\nwith Haverfoid just a game<br />\nbehind Swarthmore.<br />\nHopkins' will next take on<br />\nnationally \u2022 ranked Loyola<br />\nSaturday at 2:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nBy JOE TATE<br />\nWhen I first came to Hopkins<br />\nin September of 1972, the school<br />\nwas still adjusting to coed life on<br />\ncampus. The SAC was just<br />\nbeginning to develop its playland<br />\nsocial calendar of weekend films<br />\nand pancake brunches and there<br />\nwas no live music to be found.<br />\nBut on any given day of the week<br />\nthere were these guys who sat on<br />\nthe benches in the freshman quad<br />\nplaying guitars and singing. Their<br />\nemphasis was heavily on the<br />\nGrateful Dead and the Band,<br />\nwith a few lesser-known Van<br />\nMorrison and Rolling Stones<br />\ntunes thrown in. But you'd walk<br />\nby those benches sometimes and<br />\nhear things by Moby Grape, Sam<br />\nCooke or Ray Charles and you<br />\nknew these guys were special.<br />\nTaste, I believe it's called.<br />\nIn November of that year the<br />\nfirst Ocean Rose show was held<br />\nupstairs in Levering Hall.<br />\nSuddenly, the school had good<br />\nmusic and no reason not to<br />\ndance. The response was<br />\npandemonium, Hopkins-style.<br />\nWith the help of enlightened<br />\ndespots like Andy Savitz and<br />\nJohn Coliners, there were Ocean<br />\nRose concerts both indoor and<br />\noutdoor, day and night.<br />\nAn interesting thing happened<br />\nalong the way. In addition to<br />\ntheir impeccably selected<br />\nrepertoire of standards, the band<br />\nbegan to play original<br />\ncompositions. Songs with titles<br />\nlike \"Golden French Fries,\"<br />\n\"Don't Be A Stranger- and<br />\n\"Television Joy\" appeared and<br />\nwere met with jubilation by the<br />\ngrowing numbers of Ocean Rose<br />\nregulars. The songs, written<br /><br />\nmostly by Milt Reder and Jimmy<br />\nOwens, were intelligent, funny<br />\nand, above all, rocking. The<br />\nelecticism displayed on the<br />\nbenches was producing some<br />\ndamned good original material .<br />\nWhen Chuch Swartley and his<br />\nsaxophone joined the group in<br /><br />\nthe fall of 1973, a broad, jazzy<br />\ndimension was added to the<br />\nmusic. The originals were coming<br />\nfast and furious and each show<br />\ndrew larger and larger crowds.<br />\nThere were times when Black<br />\nRose, a band comprised of three<br /><br />\nof Milt's friends, would make the<br />\ntrip down from New York to<br />\nplay a double bill and the<br />\nresulting energy levels were<br />\nsimply astounding. Kindred<br />\nspirits and solid musicianship all<br />\nthe way around made those<br />\noccasions truly memorable.<br /><br />\nConflict<br />\nWhat followed for Ocean Rose<br />\nwere the shakeups in personnel<br />\nthat are to be expected in any<br />\nmusical partnership, especailly<br />\none formed in as transient a<br /><br />\nlocation as a college campus. But<br />\nthe most frustrating circumstance<br />\nof all was the basic conflict<br />\nbetween going to school and<br />\nplaying music. Scheduling<br />\npractice between chemistry<br />\nexams and GRE's has never<br />\nworked and that is ultimately<br /><br />\nwhat kept Ocean Rose from<br />\nachieving anything other than its<br />\nstatus as the resident Hopkins<br />\nband. It was as simple as that.<br />\nThe problem was painfully<br />\nobvious to all involved and some<br />\ndecisions and sacrifices had to be<br /><br />\nmade. Less than three months<br />\nago, Jimmy, Milt and Chuck left<br />\nBaltimore for Boston to 'join<br />\nforces with Bill Lane and Jon<br />\nGould, the Black Rose rhythm<br />\nsection, and Bruce Katcz, Ocean<br />\nRose's original pianist. With them<br />\nwent Clayton Blick,. who<br />\nengineers their sound and has<br />\nprovided them with a place to<br />\npractice.<br />\nThe group had its debut last<br />\nSaturday night at the West<br />\nRosbury Softball Association's<br />\nannual dinner and dance. There<br />\nwere 1,000 people that night in<br />\nFlorian Hall (softball being the<br />\nbiggest thing to hit Root Park<br />\nsince beer in zip-top cans) and it<br />\nreally had to be seen to be<br />\nbelieved. After an adequate<br />\nbeginning, the band suddenly<br />\ncame alive about halfway<br />\nthrough and the poeple were still<br />\nscreaming and stomping for more<br />\nwhen the management turned the<br />\nlights up at 1:30 a.m.<br />\nThe songlist reads like a small<br />\nanthology of rhythm and blues<br />\nclassics, featuring numbers like<br />\n\"Road Runner,\" \"634-5789\"<br />\nand \"Hunter Gets Captured By<br />\nThe Game\" and originals like<br />\n\"Smiles Lightning\" and \"Girl<br />\nWith the Red Bandana\" never<br />\nsounded so good. It is impossible<br />\nto convey the quality of this<br />\nband in print and I'd only end up<br />\nspoiling the surprises in \u2022store for<br />\nFriday night. Suffice to say, the<br />\ngroup has things pretty much<br />\nunder control. In fact, the only<br />\nthing. these guys don't have at<br />\nthis point is a name. That should<br />\nbe their greatest worry. And<br />\nSluggo, I'll spill a brew for you<br />\nduring \"Buccaneer.\" .<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41157, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "f0d20f7a-c0e7-4b59-8b15-fb282d1c9896", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14328-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14328, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "c6bc6fe8-7c3a-4687-9c05-853d45be4316", "url": "/node/14328"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "75946972-186c-4831-a3e5-504823a73748"}]}
