At that time we suggested that the Council be dispensed with and<br />\nthat three men\u2014corresponding to the president and<br />\nsecretary of the S. A. C. and one additional student<br />\nbe appointed as a commission to be consulted by<br />\nthe Dean when he draws up budgets.

At the meeting<br />\nthis week nothing coherent could be elicited from them<br />\non any score.

The fiction,<br />\nfurthermore, of a democratic control by the students has been upset decisively.

Some keep their self-respect<br />\nat a high pitch by an occasional jowelfull of the juicy rodents. Others are<br />\neven able to so detach themselves from<br />\nthe scheme of things that they sit back<br />\nand meditate over the spectacle in pure<br />\nidleness. This last lion position is considered with the greatest contempt by<br />\nvoices from the lower side.<br />\nAnd ,that lower side, what about the<br />\nmice?' They toil, in constant competition<br />\nwith the machine, adding height and<br />\nstrength to the wall. In general, they<br />\nare extremely suspicious of the lions,<br />\ncharging them with malicious intent in<br />\nthe use of such varied media as art, boy<br />\nscout movements, and religion. They<br />\nchafe at the unhappy lot that assigned<br />\nthem to be born mice\u2014and others, no better equipped, lions. They rebel against<br />\nthe illogical winds which have cast them<br />\nat the bottom of the social stack. And<br />\ntheir cries of misfortune sometimes float<br />\nover the barrier.<br />\n<br />\ndisplace the mice. Few indeed will be the<br />\ntasks within to occupy the great round<br />\nof new hands. Can men be happy without work? That is a great, fundamental<br />\nproblem. And there, the lions must experiment. The South Sea Islanders seem<br />\nto rejoice in pure bliss, ignorance, and<br />\ninactivity.

At that time we suggested that the Council be dispensed with and<br />\nthat three men\u2014corresponding to the president and<br />\nsecretary of the S. A. C. and one additional student<br />\nbe appointed as a commission to be consulted by<br />\nthe Dean when he draws up budgets. The petitions of any group and all possible opinions could<br />\nbe adequately represented through this commission, which would not have any more power but<br />\nmore advisory strength than the Council.

Its sudden burst<br />\nof genius was entirely superimposed; if it hadn't<br />\nbeen forcibly borne in upon the members that<br />\nthe administration seriously plans to dispense with<br />\ntheir function they wouldn't even have suspected<br />\ntheir uselessness.<br />\nHowever, once awakened to their actual status<br />\nthey seemed completly unmanned. At the meeting<br />\nthis week nothing coherent could be elicited from them<br />\non any score. What place has the student in the control of his own activities; what organization can he<br />\nuse to effect his own ends; what rules should govern<br />\ncampus groups? All these issues passed unchallenged by any sort Of analytical thought. Endless<br />\nbickering and fulmination was the only manilestation of mental existence.<br />\nActivities men and others as well will simply<br />\nhave to disabuse their minds of the misconception<br />\nthat activities are the sole province of the students.<br />\nThe insurmountable difficulty facing this idea is<br />\nthat as long as the University considers itself<br />\nultimately res'ponsible for the debts assumed by<br />\nthe activities it will not be willing to relinquish<br />\ncontrol of the financial operations. The fiction,<br />\nfurthermore, of a democratic control by the students has been upset decisively. The practice of<br />\nplaying fast and loose with student funds has<br />\nbeen so riotous under student management alone<br />\nthat the intervention of the Dean has been many<br />\ntimes justified.<br />\nIt is gratifying to observe that the plan now<br />\nunder consideration as an alternative to the pre-<br /><br />\nDo You Know?<br /><br />\nBy EDGAR KEMLER<br />\nSOME time ago, writing in this place,<br />\nEric Goldman confessed that the University's chief affliction is spiritual.

For those fortunate ones within the barrier, life holds<br />\nleadership, responsibility, and little physical work. Some keep their self-respect<br />\nat a high pitch by an occasional jowelfull of the juicy rodents. Others are<br />\neven able to so detach themselves from<br />\nthe scheme of things that they sit back<br />\nand meditate over the spectacle in pure<br />\nidleness. This last lion position is considered with the greatest contempt by<br />\nvoices from the lower side.<br />\nAnd ,that lower side, what about the<br />\nmice?' They toil, in constant competition<br />\nwith the machine, adding height and<br />\nstrength to the wall. In general, they<br />\nare extremely suspicious of the lions,<br />\ncharging them with malicious intent in<br />\nthe use of such varied media as art, boy<br />\nscout movements, and religion. They<br />\nchafe at the unhappy lot that assigned<br />\nthem to be born mice\u2014and others, no better equipped, lions. They rebel against<br />\nthe illogical winds which have cast them<br />\nat the bottom of the social stack. And<br />\ntheir cries of misfortune sometimes float<br />\nover the barrier.<br /><br />\ndisplace the mice. Few indeed will be the<br />\ntasks within to occupy the great round<br />\nof new hands. Can men be happy without work? That is a great, fundamental<br />\nproblem. And there, the lions must experiment.
