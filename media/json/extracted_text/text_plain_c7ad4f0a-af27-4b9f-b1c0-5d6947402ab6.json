With us, as students, it is a period of<br />\nrenewed resolution to live nearer the ideals which we have set for ourselves<br />\neither in scholarship or in refinement of life or in other mental occupations<br />\nwith which our life is brought into immediate contact. The student comes to<br />\ncollege to learn the meaning of introspection; to investigate the bearing which<br />\nthings outside of himself have towards his own inner mental being; to grasp in<br />\nsome limited measure the significance of the great world drama which has been<br />\nPlaying from eternity and whose finale, whose denouement is that \"grand event<br />\ntowards which the whole creation moves.\" No wonder, therefore, if at this<br />\nOpening of a new year we moralize and reflect upon what we are, why we are<br />\nhere and ask ourselves whither we are tending. Like the merchant we take<br />\nan inventory, although of quite another kind than his. The result of our reck<br />\noning should be a balance of what points of strength we possess against the<br />\nPoints of weakness. As human beings we are a bundle of forces that resist,<br />\nthat overcome and which finally spend themselves in resistance. Powers of<br />\nmind and of body go hand in hand, so to speak, through life guided with<br />\nvarying degrees of mastership according to the individual contesting them. As<br />\nour physical forces wane our mental strength, toward our later life, should<br />\nexhibit a firmness and suppleness in direct ratio to our years and accompany<br />\nour failing bodies to brighten their existence and raise them from bitterness.<br />\nThe declining age of a man who has trusted his sensual life for satisfaction,<br />\nwhether in business or pleasure or idle ease, must be, logically, physical and<br />\nmental wretchedness. Now, realizing ourselves as endowed with these ele.<br />\nments of strength which, by some inscrutable law, must spend themselves, must<br />\nobjectify themselves in visible or rather tangible demonstration, we can reckon<br />\nwith ourselves as to what parts of our being need more attention than others.<br />\nIn other words, what are our points of weakness; what forces in our nature are<br />\nliable to show least resistance. The human frame, as we call it, falls asunder<br />\nnot by the utter collapse of all the parts\u2014bones, muscles and nerves\u2014but owing<br />\nto the frailty of a single weakness, which entails entire dissolution and which<br />\nthe forces of the system collectively cannot stay. Any material object, in like<br />\nmanner, follows precisely the same law. In the moral world the phenomena of<br />\nstrength and weakness also appears. It may be the Greeks meant to convey a<br />\nlesson to their youth of the importance of watching the weak point in character<br />\nby the portrayal of Hercules writhing under a tunic which his world-lifting<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER\u2022<br />\n<br />\nstrength could not remove. Or the picture of Achilles might have afforded the<br />\nsame moral when that flower of Greek military prowess was made to meet death<br />\nat the hands of Paris who happened to direct the arrow against his invulnerable<br />\nbody. The hero fell because his heel had not been bathed in the stream whose<br />\nwaters had saved him from ten thousand arrows hitherto. It may be also that<br />\nSamson's career and its sequel conveys a meaning similar to that of Hercules<br />\nor Achilles. We can infer that if these giants of myth and history fell at the<br />\npoint of their greatest weakness, then our lives are subject to the same general<br />\nconditions as theirs. The unexpected, the unforseen contingencies are those<br />\nwhich, appearing suddenly as they do, strike at us and may prove too much for<br />\nthe resistance we can offer them. As students, we need strength to sustain the<br />\ncourage of conviction, and very frequently at times when, unawares, we stand<br />\nconfronted with a difficulty that only immediate courage can surmount.<br />\nThere is a moral sang-froid as well as a mental. Not that a man is to burden<br />\nhimself with a suspicion of danger impending, and to let the dread of it cast a<br />\ncloud over his life-----on the contrary\u2014to face with calmness any emergency that<br />\nmay arise and despatch it cheerfully. A coward walks backwards into greater<br />\ndangers frequently than he would if he went forward, simply because he can see<br />\nwhere he is going w hen he faces the trouble he has to meet and might avert it<br />\nlargely. One of the forces we cultivate in college life is perseverance, which<br />\nis a phase of bravery; bravery, because after efforts made and repeated almost<br />\nto the point of physical pain we succeed in overturning and -laying out\" the<br />\ndifficulty that baffles during long hours. Milton is said to have passed scarcely<br />\nNow, in the<br />\na single one of his waking hours without a book in his hand<br />\nupon whom<br />\nthose<br />\nof<br />\npurpose<br />\nthe<br />\nexactly<br />\nis<br />\nit<br />\ntraining we receive at college,<br />\nthat responsibiliiy falls to guide the forces inherent in our nature along the lines<br />\nof courage, perseverance and restraint; to make us masters of ourselves and<br />\nhusband our energies according to reason; to teach us the lesson of self confidence plus a tranquility of bearing that marks a gentleman. Then,once started<br />\nin the direction of these attainments we grow into the educated man if<br />\nthough we forget every word of Latin and Greek that we ever<br />\nthumbed out of a lexicon. If this short paper were a fragment of a treatise on<br />\nethics which it is obviously not, the argument might prove how such a training<br />\nof the forces in a man's self reacted upon him and the race at large to the making of a better community in which he should chance to live. The important<br />\npoint of all is that, adding to his common sense, (which if Ile lack, no eduction<br />\nwere better in his case) the results gained from his intercourse with instructors<br />\nand fellow students and from conscientious painstaking with the very few books<br />\nrerched in three years' study, a student should go into the world with a<br />\nthoroughly healthful realization of his own strength and weakness and should<br />\nbe prepared to stand his ground cheerfully and firmly. In the natural course of<br />\nevents a student, when once left to his own resources ought to develope and<br />\nsurvive as against one who has never been apprised of his failings; his standard<br />\nof what a man is being higher than that of his unlettered neighbor requires of him<br />\ngreater action and should guard him against the shocks of experience by leading him to resist them with equanimity. Fortitude can cope with odds and bear<br />\ndefeat; brute strength gives way almost immediately on meeting a force but<br />\nslightly greater than its own\u2014the one is intelligent strength while the other<br />\nlacks intelligence, and the college man who leaves his Alma Mater a stranger<br />\nto the meaning of this has to begin life on the level of boyhood.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nTHE CHRISTMAS TRIP OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\n44froHAT! going to the Eastern Shore?\"<br />\n.<br />\nThis was the disgusted comment of most of the men when they<br />\nheard that the management of the University Glee, Banjo, and<br />\nMandolin Clubs had decided to take in Cambridge, Easton, and Salisbury this<br />\nyear, instead of the usual jaunt to the Valley of Virginia. Most of the men,<br />\nhowever, had evidently never experienced true Eastern Shore hospitality before, and a pleasant surprise awaited them, for the trip was the most enjoyable<br />\nChristmas trip ever taken by the clubs, and the most successful, artistically and<br />\nfinancially.<br />\nThe clubs, numbering 29 musicians of no mean ability, left Baltimore for<br />\nCambridge Monday, December 29th, on the steamer \"Avalon.\" The journey<br />\ndown the bay was not without incident The development of certain athletic<br />\ntendencies'by one of the heretofore solely literary and social lights of the clubs<br />\nmerely goes to subs,antiate the fact that a college education certainly does<br />\nbroaden one's scope.<br />\nWhen the clubs arrived at Cambridge, the men were invited to stay with<br />\nmany of the prominent old families there, and, of course, had a royal time.<br />\nThree dances in twenty hours ought to be a record, if it isn't. But even greater<br />\nthan the number of dances were the attractions and charms of Cambridge's<br />\nbeauteous daughters. The men, partfcularly one of them, completely lost their<br />\nhearts in this old storehouse of Dorchester County's history.<br />\nThe next place visited was Easton The same cordial welcome awaited<br />\nthe clubs here. After the concert, which was the best of the three, Mrs. Os\u2014<br />\nwald Tilghman gave a fine dance, lasting well on into the New Year, at her<br />\nresidence. The house was a splendid one for the inevitable tele-a-tete, and the<br />\nmen made the best of their opportunities.<br />\nTo the accompaniment of sobs from the fair maidens, the men took their<br />\nleave of Easton Thursday morning. Our manager was so broken up at parting<br />\nthat he forgot most of his belongings, and had to return for them later. The<br />\ntrip to Salisbury was pleasant, the engine at times attaining the remarkable<br />\nspeed of iso<br />\nmiles an hour. Contrary to the precedent of all other Christmas<br />\ntrips, the prevailing card-game wfis whist. Some of the upper-clasmen devoted<br />\npart of their time to the study of the education of the young, and all that one<br />\nhad to do when an attendant was wanted was to blow a whistle, and a freshman<br />\nimmediately ran up to get his orders.<br />\nThe afternoon at Salisbury was spent in making calls and drinking eggnogg. The certainly know how to brew it across the bay.<br />\nThe crowd at the Salisbury concert was the largest one of the trip. After<br />\nthe concert was over, a most enjoyable Eastern Shore dinner was given by<br />\nRichard N. Jackson, '05, son of Ex-Gov. Jackson, whose family reside at Salisbury during the summer.<br />\nThere was some little disturbance at the hotel that night, owing to the fact<br />\nthat the room of two of the banjo club men had been wrecked. There was an<br />\nexciting battle on the third floor for a while, but it was interrupted several times<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nby visits of the proprietor. The men were at length quieted, and the two unfortunates of the banjo club were sent to bed in another room by Mr Snake,<br />\nthe irate host.<br />\nIt was hard for the men to get up at 6.30 Friday morning, but they had to<br />\ndo it. A few of the men were so completely carried off their feet by the charms<br />\nof Cambridge and Easton that they could not resist the temptation to go back<br />\nthere, but the majority returned via Claiborne to Baltimore, arriving here at 2<br />\nP. M. Friday.<br />\nThe men taken were:<br />\nMessrs. R. C. Pagon, Jackson, Humrichouse, Carver, Marshall, Bryan,<br />\nGilman, Hall, Ford, CoNites, Martin, Randall, Mason, Engle, Eveland, Coffin,<br />\nWinter, l,angnecker, Redewill, Baetjer, Nelson, Lanier, Snowden, Hendry,<br />\nBird, Plaggemyer, Geiger, W.

Stephens leads next week.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nThe end this week brings to us a man of very marked ability, power, and<br />\nexperience. It is planned that next Sunday, January t ith, at 3.30, T. Jays,<br />\nEsq., St. Thomas' Hospital, London, Eng , will speak to college men. We<br />\nhave invited all the other Baltimore colleges to meet with us and if Hopkins<br />\nmen do their part to hold up a good reputation for Hopkins the upstairs room<br />\nin Levering Hall should be filled. Mr. Jays represents the British student<br />\nwork and is on leave of absence for this year to travel for the American Student<br />\nVolunteer movement among our colleges. Those of us who met hi in last year<br />\nrecall our great pleasure. We wish the same for all who will avail themselves<br />\nof this opportunity. Mr. Jays will be in town several days and be very glad to<br />\nmeet as many men personally as possible.<br />\nHe comes to us as a fellow student who has worked for a number of years<br />\nas missionary in Western Africa, and now returned to complete the medical<br />\ncourse. At the end of his course he returns to the African position. His stories<br />\nof difficulties, dangers and privations met with and the triumphs of the Gospel<br />\namong those people are facinating. One feels their force aad influence from the<br />\nstrong personality of the man. All men not :.fraid of such a presentation are<br />\nurged to take this opportunity.<br />\nAny man who run across an opportunity for a handbook \u201cadd\" are urged<br />\nto pick it up and mention to J.

His editorials, liberal in tone<br />\nand free from class or ,fractional bias, bore witness to his thorough acquaintance<br />\nwith all phases of University life and to a jealous regard for its customs and traditions.<br />\nFrom now until within a few weeks of the close of the college year Mr.<br />\nLanier will be engaged in editing the Hullabaloo.

Captain Straus is doing his part, the old men are as conscientious as ever, and the coach is painstaking and careful with all who<br />\nrequires his attention. The serious trouble lies with the new men. During<br />\nthe past month General Apathy has been making a vigorous campaign among<br />\nthem. Few took the trouble to come out, and those few evinced a surprising<br />\nlack of interest in the game. Considering that the Freshmen were facing their<br />\nfirst examinations something may be pardoned them; yet it seems strange that<br />\nthey could not find some time to devote to Hopkins' greatest game. The old<br />\nmen cannot play on forever, new blood must be injected from time to time, and<br />\nthe members of the Freshman Class are to supply this new blood. It would be<br />\na disgrace to the class and to the University as well if they refused to accept<br />\nthe burdens which college life imposes upon them. A man who can work but<br />\npersists in shirking his duty is not worthy of a place among us. This is the beginning of a new term and it is to be hoped that a new spirit will animate the<br />\nnew men from the very first. The game is a facinating one, and well repays<br />\nthe time and attention one may bestow upon it.<br />\nThe track team, also, has not had its full quota of new men at all times.<br />\nAs in the case of the lacrosse team the old guard has been faithfully at work.<br />\nDuring the holidays scarcely a day passed but what some of the old men were<br />\nat work in the cage. With the inter class games not more than three weeks off<br />\neach class ought to get out as many men as possible, for every point will count.<br />\nBesides that, these games will be excellent prrctice for the new men; they will<br />\ngive a feeling of confidence which will be of great advantage when the time<br />\ncomes to run in competition with outsiders.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER has no desire to preach, but it cannot refrain from<br />\nuttering a word of warning and advice to the new men.<br />\nUST at present the question of a debate with the Leland Stanford, Jr.,<br />\nUniversity is being agitated.

On the<br />\nfirst day after the holidays, regular systematic work was renewed. The<br />\ncage once again began to assume its old-time business-like appearance. Straggling in from all directions came embryo record-breakers and old stagers to put<br />\nthemselves under the tender care of \"Pather Bill,\" who must discover and<br />\ndevelop the best that is in them. Previous to this the training has been of a<br />\ndesultory nature. However, from now on, hard, steady, unterrupted by holidays, will be strictly observed. The work, light at first, will gradually be<br />\nincreased until the best possible results are obtained.<br />\nNo definite plans for the future have as yet been formulated. One idea to<br />\nbe highly commended is the proposed holding of Interclass games in the cage.<br />\nThe events, if found practicable, would probably include relay races, 30 yard<br />\ndash, 440 yard, one half and one mile run, high jump and shot-put. Aside<br />\nfrom furnishing amusement to the spectators, arousing interest, and perhaps<br />\nraising funds, they have a very important influence upon the general work of<br />\nthe Track Team. They will undoubtedly stimulate interest in track work and<br />\nbring out men whose ability is as yet unknown even to themselves. A little<br />\nfriendly class rivalry will sometimes stir up class and college spirit that can be<br />\nreached in no other way, and when once aroused it is not likely to decrease,<br />\nbut give vent to itself in many ways.<br />\nJust here in connection with interclass games, it may not he altogether out<br />\nof place to say a word about the recent cane-rush\u2014that was not. The 6th of<br />\nDecember, the Christmas holidays, and the beginning of the second term are all<br />\nthings of the past. But what of the cane-rush! Is it a thing of the future?<br />\nEverybody seems to know less about it than everybody else. The silence on<br />\nthe subject from some quarters has become so oppressive that it can almost be<br />\nfelt.

With us, as students, it is a period of<br />\nrenewed resolution to live nearer the ideals which we have set for ourselves<br />\neither in scholarship or in refinement of life or in other mental occupations<br />\nwith which our life is brought into immediate contact. The student comes to<br />\ncollege to learn the meaning of introspection; to investigate the bearing which<br />\nthings outside of himself have towards his own inner mental being; to grasp in<br />\nsome limited measure the significance of the great world drama which has been<br />\nPlaying from eternity and whose finale, whose denouement is that \"grand event<br />\ntowards which the whole creation moves.\" No wonder, therefore, if at this<br />\nOpening of a new year we moralize and reflect upon what we are, why we are<br />\nhere and ask ourselves whither we are tending. Like the merchant we take<br />\nan inventory, although of quite another kind than his. The result of our reck<br />\noning should be a balance of what points of strength we possess against the<br />\nPoints of weakness. As human beings we are a bundle of forces that resist,<br />\nthat overcome and which finally spend themselves in resistance. Powers of<br />\nmind and of body go hand in hand, so to speak, through life guided with<br />\nvarying degrees of mastership according to the individual contesting them. As<br />\nour physical forces wane our mental strength, toward our later life, should<br />\nexhibit a firmness and suppleness in direct ratio to our years and accompany<br />\nour failing bodies to brighten their existence and raise them from bitterness.<br />\nThe declining age of a man who has trusted his sensual life for satisfaction,<br />\nwhether in business or pleasure or idle ease, must be, logically, physical and<br />\nmental wretchedness. Now, realizing ourselves as endowed with these ele.<br />\nments of strength which, by some inscrutable law, must spend themselves, must<br />\nobjectify themselves in visible or rather tangible demonstration, we can reckon<br />\nwith ourselves as to what parts of our being need more attention than others.<br />\nIn other words, what are our points of weakness; what forces in our nature are<br />\nliable to show least resistance. The human frame, as we call it, falls asunder<br />\nnot by the utter collapse of all the parts\u2014bones, muscles and nerves\u2014but owing<br />\nto the frailty of a single weakness, which entails entire dissolution and which<br />\nthe forces of the system collectively cannot stay. Any material object, in like<br />\nmanner, follows precisely the same law. In the moral world the phenomena of<br />\nstrength and weakness also appears. It may be the Greeks meant to convey a<br />\nlesson to their youth of the importance of watching the weak point in character<br />\nby the portrayal of Hercules writhing under a tunic which his world-lifting<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER\u2022<br /><br />\nstrength could not remove. Or the picture of Achilles might have afforded the<br />\nsame moral when that flower of Greek military prowess was made to meet death<br />\nat the hands of Paris who happened to direct the arrow against his invulnerable<br />\nbody. The hero fell because his heel had not been bathed in the stream whose<br />\nwaters had saved him from ten thousand arrows hitherto. It may be also that<br />\nSamson's career and its sequel conveys a meaning similar to that of Hercules<br />\nor Achilles. We can infer that if these giants of myth and history fell at the<br />\npoint of their greatest weakness, then our lives are subject to the same general<br />\nconditions as theirs. The unexpected, the unforseen contingencies are those<br />\nwhich, appearing suddenly as they do, strike at us and may prove too much for<br />\nthe resistance we can offer them. As students, we need strength to sustain the<br />\ncourage of conviction, and very frequently at times when, unawares, we stand<br />\nconfronted with a difficulty that only immediate courage can surmount.<br />\nThere is a moral sang-froid as well as a mental. Not that a man is to burden<br />\nhimself with a suspicion of danger impending, and to let the dread of it cast a<br />\ncloud over his life-----on the contrary\u2014to face with calmness any emergency that<br />\nmay arise and despatch it cheerfully. A coward walks backwards into greater<br />\ndangers frequently than he would if he went forward, simply because he can see<br />\nwhere he is going w hen he faces the trouble he has to meet and might avert it<br />\nlargely. One of the forces we cultivate in college life is perseverance, which<br />\nis a phase of bravery; bravery, because after efforts made and repeated almost<br />\nto the point of physical pain we succeed in overturning and -laying out\" the<br />\ndifficulty that baffles during long hours. Milton is said to have passed scarcely<br />\nNow, in the<br />\na single one of his waking hours without a book in his hand<br />\nupon whom<br />\nthose<br />\nof<br />\npurpose<br />\nthe<br />\nexactly<br />\nis<br />\nit<br />\ntraining we receive at college,<br />\nthat responsibiliiy falls to guide the forces inherent in our nature along the lines<br />\nof courage, perseverance and restraint; to make us masters of ourselves and<br />\nhusband our energies according to reason; to teach us the lesson of self confidence plus a tranquility of bearing that marks a gentleman. Then,once started<br />\nin the direction of these attainments we grow into the educated man if<br />\nthough we forget every word of Latin and Greek that we ever<br />\nthumbed out of a lexicon. If this short paper were a fragment of a treatise on<br />\nethics which it is obviously not, the argument might prove how such a training<br />\nof the forces in a man's self reacted upon him and the race at large to the making of a better community in which he should chance to live. The important<br />\npoint of all is that, adding to his common sense, (which if Ile lack, no eduction<br />\nwere better in his case) the results gained from his intercourse with instructors<br />\nand fellow students and from conscientious painstaking with the very few books<br />\nrerched in three years' study, a student should go into the world with a<br />\nthoroughly healthful realization of his own strength and weakness and should<br />\nbe prepared to stand his ground cheerfully and firmly. In the natural course of<br />\nevents a student, when once left to his own resources ought to develope and<br />\nsurvive as against one who has never been apprised of his failings; his standard<br />\nof what a man is being higher than that of his unlettered neighbor requires of him<br />\ngreater action and should guard him against the shocks of experience by leading him to resist them with equanimity. Fortitude can cope with odds and bear<br />\ndefeat; brute strength gives way almost immediately on meeting a force but<br />\nslightly greater than its own\u2014the one is intelligent strength while the other<br />\nlacks intelligence, and the college man who leaves his Alma Mater a stranger<br />\nto the meaning of this has to begin life on the level of boyhood.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHE CHRISTMAS TRIP OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\n44froHAT! going to the Eastern Shore?\"<br />\n.<br />\nThis was the disgusted comment of most of the men when they<br />\nheard that the management of the University Glee, Banjo, and<br />\nMandolin Clubs had decided to take in Cambridge, Easton, and Salisbury this<br />\nyear, instead of the usual jaunt to the Valley of Virginia. Most of the men,<br />\nhowever, had evidently never experienced true Eastern Shore hospitality before, and a pleasant surprise awaited them, for the trip was the most enjoyable<br />\nChristmas trip ever taken by the clubs, and the most successful, artistically and<br />\nfinancially.<br />\nThe clubs, numbering 29 musicians of no mean ability, left Baltimore for<br />\nCambridge Monday, December 29th, on the steamer \"Avalon.\" The journey<br />\ndown the bay was not without incident The development of certain athletic<br />\ntendencies'by one of the heretofore solely literary and social lights of the clubs<br />\nmerely goes to subs,antiate the fact that a college education certainly does<br />\nbroaden one's scope.<br />\nWhen the clubs arrived at Cambridge, the men were invited to stay with<br />\nmany of the prominent old families there, and, of course, had a royal time.<br />\nThree dances in twenty hours ought to be a record, if it isn't. But even greater<br />\nthan the number of dances were the attractions and charms of Cambridge's<br />\nbeauteous daughters. The men, partfcularly one of them, completely lost their<br />\nhearts in this old storehouse of Dorchester County's history.<br />\nThe next place visited was Easton The same cordial welcome awaited<br />\nthe clubs here. After the concert, which was the best of the three, Mrs. Os\u2014<br />\nwald Tilghman gave a fine dance, lasting well on into the New Year, at her<br />\nresidence. The house was a splendid one for the inevitable tele-a-tete, and the<br />\nmen made the best of their opportunities.<br />\nTo the accompaniment of sobs from the fair maidens, the men took their<br />\nleave of Easton Thursday morning. Our manager was so broken up at parting<br />\nthat he forgot most of his belongings, and had to return for them later. The<br />\ntrip to Salisbury was pleasant, the engine at times attaining the remarkable<br />\nspeed of iso<br />\nmiles an hour. Contrary to the precedent of all other Christmas<br />\ntrips, the prevailing card-game wfis whist. Some of the upper-clasmen devoted<br />\npart of their time to the study of the education of the young, and all that one<br />\nhad to do when an attendant was wanted was to blow a whistle, and a freshman<br />\nimmediately ran up to get his orders.<br />\nThe afternoon at Salisbury was spent in making calls and drinking eggnogg. The certainly know how to brew it across the bay.<br />\nThe crowd at the Salisbury concert was the largest one of the trip. After<br />\nthe concert was over, a most enjoyable Eastern Shore dinner was given by<br />\nRichard N. Jackson, '05, son of Ex-Gov. Jackson, whose family reside at Salisbury during the summer.<br />\nThere was some little disturbance at the hotel that night, owing to the fact<br />\nthat the room of two of the banjo club men had been wrecked. There was an<br />\nexciting battle on the third floor for a while, but it was interrupted several times<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nby visits of the proprietor. The men were at length quieted, and the two unfortunates of the banjo club were sent to bed in another room by Mr Snake,<br />\nthe irate host.<br />\nIt was hard for the men to get up at 6.30 Friday morning, but they had to<br />\ndo it. A few of the men were so completely carried off their feet by the charms<br />\nof Cambridge and Easton that they could not resist the temptation to go back<br />\nthere, but the majority returned via Claiborne to Baltimore, arriving here at 2<br />\nP. M. Friday.<br />\nThe men taken were:<br />\nMessrs. R. C.

Lanier relinquishes his position as head of the paper in<br />\norder to devote his entire time to the Hullabaloo. It is with regret<br />\nthat his co workers on the NEWS-LETTER part company with their editor-inchief. Since his first year at the University lie has been an energetic, efficient<br />\nworker for the good of the paper, devoting to it his time and talent with unstinted measure, The N itws LETTER loses him only that he may devote himself to the labors which the class of 1903 has declared to be peculiarly his own.<br />\nWhile Mr.. Lanier made no radical changes in the policy pursued by his<br />\npredecessors, he has strengthened the paper by his careful attention to the various departments of college life and by securing a series of leading articles which<br />\nhave been of timely ,interest to the student body. His editorials, liberal in tone<br />\nand free from class or ,fractional bias, bore witness to his thorough acquaintance<br />\nwith all phases of University life and to a jealous regard for its customs and traditions.<br />\nFrom now until within a few weeks of the close of the college year Mr.<br />\nLanier will be engaged in editing the Hullabaloo. With such an editor-in-chief<br />\nthe class of 1903 makes no idle boast in declaring that the Hullabaloo this season will be far superior to any previous year-book.<br /><br />\nero<br /><br />\nTHU N EWS\u2014LETTUR,<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nIn his management of the paper the NEWS-LITTER feels that Mr. Lanier<br />\nhas given promise of a useful literary career In him was found that rare combination of literary talent and executive ability which gives assurance of future<br />\nsuccess in the field of letters. The NEWS LETTER does not doubt but that future<br />\neditors of this paper will feel an honest thrill of pride on thinking that they are<br />\nworking on the same paper which Bob\" Lanier once edited.<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nHE lacrosse situation at present cannot be said to call forth the enthusiasm<br />\nof its follows. Captain Straus is doing his part, the old men are as conscientious as ever, and the coach is painstaking and careful with all who<br />\nrequires his attention. The serious trouble lies with the new men. During<br />\nthe past month General Apathy has been making a vigorous campaign among<br />\nthem. Few took the trouble to come out, and those few evinced a surprising<br />\nlack of interest in the game. Considering that the Freshmen were facing their<br />\nfirst examinations something may be pardoned them; yet it seems strange that<br />\nthey could not find some time to devote to Hopkins' greatest game. The old<br />\nmen cannot play on forever, new blood must be injected from time to time, and<br />\nthe members of the Freshman Class are to supply this new blood. It would be<br />\na disgrace to the class and to the University as well if they refused to accept<br />\nthe burdens which college life imposes upon them. A man who can work but<br />\npersists in shirking his duty is not worthy of a place among us. This is the beginning of a new term and it is to be hoped that a new spirit will animate the<br />\nnew men from the very first. The game is a facinating one, and well repays<br />\nthe time and attention one may bestow upon it.<br />\nThe track team, also, has not had its full quota of new men at all times.<br />\nAs in the case of the lacrosse team the old guard has been faithfully at work.<br />\nDuring the holidays scarcely a day passed but what some of the old men were<br />\nat work in the cage. With the inter class games not more than three weeks off<br />\neach class ought to get out as many men as possible, for every point will count.<br />\nBesides that, these games will be excellent prrctice for the new men; they will<br />\ngive a feeling of confidence which will be of great advantage when the time<br />\ncomes to run in competition with outsiders.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER has no desire to preach, but it cannot refrain from<br />\nuttering a word of warning and advice to the new men.<br />\nUST at present the question of a debate with the Leland Stanford, Jr.,<br />\nUniversity is being agitated. To the NEWS-LETTER the idea of going<br />\nquite across the continent at the present time seems senseless, if not to<br />\nsay ridiculous, when we can find at our own doors so many foemen worthy of<br />\nour steel, What end cin be furthered by debating with Leland Stanford, which<br />\nwould not be subserved as well by debating with some college nearer home?<br />\nWe shall have our hands full in preparing for the debate with North Carolina.<br />\nWhatever time may be available after this one is concluded could well be devoted to a debate with some other college, but why it is necessary to go to<br />\nLeland Stanford is beyond our comprehension.<br /><br />\nJ<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nthe<br />\nZHli large number of Hopkins men who were present at the meeting of<br />\nde\u2014<br />\nis<br />\nholidays<br />\nthe<br />\ng<br />\ndun<br />\nil<br />\nn<br />\nAssociatio<br />\nLanguage<br />\nmeeting of the Modern<br />\nserving of more than passing note.

THE FABLE OF THE NEVER-WORKS<br />\nNCE upon a time there was a class in Bugology. Each and every one was<br />\na noble specimen, worthy of a better fate. Their time was spent in the<br />\nelusive hunt for animals who had a faculty of hiding behind grains of<br />\nBy the aid of their microscopes they<br />\nsand and other minute particles of matter<br />\nwhen they thought of what<br />\nappetites<br />\nsaw so many things that they lost their<br />\nthan those kept in bottles<br />\nother<br />\nliquids<br />\nno<br />\nthey might be eating, and they drank<br />\nLouis.<br />\nSaint<br />\nin<br />\nand guarenteed with a blue ribbon made<br />\nSuch was the class.<br />\nTheir mornings they spent in learning long definitions, their afternoons in<br />\nchasing the giddy bacteria across a colored slide, and their evenings in trying<br />\nto forget what they had learned in order that they might start fresh the next<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nmorning.<br />\nSuch a remark as this would occasionally awaken the class from its lethargy:<br />\n\"0 professor, I have had three installments of goo, and I can't find my cute<br />\nlittle bug anywhere!\" But such intervals of intellectual lucidity were rare.<br />\nExamination day dawned at last. The questions were jotted on the board<br />\namid groans trom the assembled victims. From previous examination papers<br />\nthey thought they knew what was coining, but they were foiled again, and the<br />\njanitor chortled in his glee. So it came to pass that the Bugologists were seized<br />\nwith violent stage fright, and were smitten hip and thigh with that which they<br />\nhad held to be a cinch. When the marks were forthcoming, lo! few had passed,<br />\nand they as if by accident The tenth part has not been told, but the mantle of<br />\nsweet charity covereth the rest.<br />\nMORAL \u2014This fable teaches freshmen that all play and no work makes<br />\nJack a dull boy.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nLACROSSE OUTLOOK.<br />\nOW that the ordeal of the Christmas examinations and the dissipation ot<br />\nthe holidays is over, the captains of the lacrosse and of the track and<br />\nfield teams will have a right to the attention of the men for several<br />\nmonths to come. In the direction of lacrosse particularly, Captain Henry<br />\nStrauss purposes continuing systematic work in the cage until the first signs of<br />\nSpring appear, and the candidates are able to turn out at Druid Hill Park.<br />\nThe first practice this year was held in the cage Tuesday afternoon, and a<br />\nvery encouraging squad put in appearance.<br />\nA feeling of reticence, however, still seems to exist among the freshmen,<br />\nfor '05 turned out a very small percentage of the whole squad There is certainly no good reason for this, for the class is large and contains quite a number<br />\nof well-developed men. Smoke up, freshmen! \"It's up to you.\"<br />\nAs regards prospects, the outlook is decidedly better than it appeared at<br />\nthe close of the season last year. Several of the candidates\u2014notably those<br />\nfrom the junior ranks\u2014are showing up remarkably well Briscoe, the goal<br />\nveteran, may return in a few weeks; Ranft, of the 1901 team, declares his<br />\ninsention of trying for a position on the twelve; and Captain Strauss with a<br />\nknowing smile tias one or two other trump cards up his sleeve, which will not<br />\nbe divulged at present.<br />\n.<br />\nJust as was the case in football last fall, the lacrosse team also needs a fast<br />\nscrub, and it behooves every new man to come out and learn to handle a stick.<br />\nIt is an obligation due the University.<br />\nThe usual uncertainty still exists in regard to th-1, schedule for the season.<br />\nThe dates with Swarthmore and Stevens Institute are certain, but Lehigh wants<br />\nto play later in the season, and Cornell is apparently by no means anxious to<br />\nline up against Hopkins on her own grounds The Crescent Athletic Club is<br />\nalso due here in May, and a reply from Oxford, England, is expected every<br />\nday. Besides these two brilliant exhibition games, a third will probably be<br />\nadded in the direcLion of the Toronto twelve. It is more than likely that the<br />\nCanadians will repeat their visit to Baltimore for another contest in June.<br />\nWith a collegiate league composed of four teams and such exhibition games<br />\nas the foregoing, the season should be the greatest in the history of lacrosse at<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nLet every man come out and hustle! There's a feeling of duty well-discharged as well as all kinds of glory in it.<br /><br />\nal<br /><br />\nI I<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTRACT TEAM AT WORK.<br /><br />\nT the present time it is not possible to give a very definite account of the<br />\naffairs of the Track Team, as it is only in a formative period. On the<br />\nfirst day after the holidays, regular systematic work was renewed. The<br />\ncage once again began to assume its old-time business-like appearance. Straggling in from all directions came embryo record-breakers and old stagers to put<br />\nthemselves under the tender care of \"Pather Bill,\" who must discover and<br />\ndevelop the best that is in them. Previous to this the training has been of a<br />\ndesultory nature. However, from now on, hard, steady, unterrupted by holidays, will be strictly observed. The work, light at first, will gradually be<br />\nincreased until the best possible results are obtained.<br />\nNo definite plans for the future have as yet been formulated. One idea to<br />\nbe highly commended is the proposed holding of Interclass games in the cage.<br />\nThe events, if found practicable, would probably include relay races, 30 yard<br />\ndash, 440 yard, one half and one mile run, high jump and shot-put. Aside<br />\nfrom furnishing amusement to the spectators, arousing interest, and perhaps<br />\nraising funds, they have a very important influence upon the general work of<br />\nthe Track Team. They will undoubtedly stimulate interest in track work and<br />\nbring out men whose ability is as yet unknown even to themselves. A little<br />\nfriendly class rivalry will sometimes stir up class and college spirit that can be<br />\nreached in no other way, and when once aroused it is not likely to decrease,<br />\nbut give vent to itself in many ways.<br />\nJust here in connection with interclass games, it may not he altogether out<br />\nof place to say a word about the recent cane-rush\u2014that was not. The 6th of<br />\nDecember, the Christmas holidays, and the beginning of the second term are all<br />\nthings of the past. But what of the cane-rush! Is it a thing of the future?<br />\nEverybody seems to know less about it than everybody else. The silence on<br />\nthe subject from some quarters has become so oppressive that it can almost be<br />\nfelt. The facts in the case are becoming more and more complicated, and are<br />\ngradually giving way to vague rumors. Now that the holidays are over, it is<br />\ntime that some definite action be taken in the matter. Speak up, someone, and<br />\nrelieve the suspense of those concerned.<br />\nCaptain Hoffman has been on the sick list for several days. He is now<br />\nwill be<br />\nable to direct the work of the men, however, and from now on work<br />\ncarried on every evening in the cage.<br />\nhim<br />\nH. K.
