He became much<br />\nlarger, until I could see his black<br />\nvest, white suit and cane. The<br />\nwhite cane reminded me that it<br />\nwas the same man who watched<br />\nme put mustard on my<br />\ncrabcakes, and he had warned me<br />\nnot to put on too much. And<br />\nthen I was sure it was the very<br />\nsame man who had made some<br />\nsort of gesture to me at the<br />\ncarnival entrance.<br />\nHis image blurred into the<br />\ncrowd as the ferris wheel drew<br />\nme under and up, above the<br />\nbooths and the restaurant<br />\nrotating on its space needle.<br />\nHurriedly I scanned the melee, but<br />\nwith no luck. I couldn't wait for<br />\nthe ride to finish, so I could<br />\ninvestigate who this man was and<br />\nwhat he wanted from me; but the<br />\nferris wheel was sweeping faster<br />\nand faster, it seemed, and I<br />\nwasn't sure if I would ever see<br />\nthat ebony mustache again, or<br />\nwhat I would say if I did.<br />\nEach time I circled, the ground<br />\nshowed no sign of him.<br />\nLater, dawdling down the<br />\nfairway, stuffing cotton candy in<br />\nmy face, which gave me a pink<br />\nmustache, he appeared in the<br />\ndoorway of a display. The cane<br />\nflashed in the sun as the man<br />\nWith the ebony mustache<br />\nstretched the canvas high above<br />\nme so that I might pass before<br />\nhim into the tent.<br />\nI saw a crowd of people<br />\nshuffling through hay, looking<br />\ninto stalls; muffled sounds of<br />\nhorses or maybe baboons<br />\nwere projected towards me<br />\nthrough the din of the gay<br />\ncrowd.<br />\nWas I being solicited or merely<br />\nentertained?

The occasion is the<br />\nseventh annual Baltimore City<br />\nFair, which begins today and<br />\nruns through Sunday night.<br />\nThe festivities take place just<br />\nwest of the newly-refurbished<br />\nInner Harbor, with the port and<br />\nthe downtown business district<br />\nacting as a scenic backdrop.<br />\nEntertainment will be<br />\nprovided nonstop on each of the<br />\nfair's five stages. Headliners<br />\ninclude singer Joe Williams at 8<br />\np.m. Friday, bandleader Benny<br />\nGoodman at 8 p.m. Saturday,<br />\nand drummer Buddy Rich at 8<br />\np.m. Sunday. Specialty acts will<br />\nbe presented on the<br />\ncountry-western, ethnic, and<br />\nchildren's stages.<br />\nThe food selection will also<br />\nrun the gamut from the<br />\ntraditional standbys to the wildly<br />\nexotic. Several ethnic<br />\norganizations will sell native<br />\ndelicacies, and the conventional<br />\nMaryland crabcakes and beer will<br />\nabound.<br />\nDespite its loose appearance,<br />\nthe fair serves a serious purpose.<br />\nAs Lannie Taliaserro of the fair's<br />\nCoordinating Council explained,<br />\n\"Our philosophy has always been<br />\nto focus on the vitality of<br />\nBaltimore as an urban center. It's<br />\nthe onl fair of its kind, and it<br />\n<br />\nwas brought into being to point<br />\nup that Baltimore is not dead.\"<br />\nIn keeping with this attitude,<br />\nthe fair stresses individual arid<br />\ncommunity involvement. For<br />\nexample, almost all of the more<br />\nthan 7,000 workers are<br />\nvolunteers. Their dedication<br />\nstems from pride in Baltimore<br />\nand their neighborhoods.<br />\nRandall Shaull, chairman of<br />\nthe Irvington booth, commented<br />\non the fair's importance. \"Since<br />\nWorld War II, the world has been<br />\nused to transiency. People just<br />\nmove. They don't take advantage<br />\nof their city. I have to have a<br />\npositive viewpoint. If I didn't feel<br />\nthis way, I wouldn't be in this<br />\nbusiness.\"<br />\nShaull's booth is only one of<br />\n75 neighborhood display stalls<br />\ndesigned by community groups<br />\nto promote their areas. The<br />\nIrvington booth will feature a<br />\nlarge cartoon-style map of the<br />\nsection, a residential region in the<br />\nsouthwest. A collage of<br />\nphotographs will display<br />\nneighborhood landmarks and<br />\nhistorical material. The<br />\nimportant idea, according to<br />\nShaull, \"is to keep it<br />\nnon-commercial, fresh, and<br />\nappealing.\"<br />\nGene Ruckle, coordinator of<br />\nthe Greater Homewood booth,<br />\nhopes that his booth serves as \"a<br />\nguide to the Greater Homewood<br />\nArea and its services.\" A slide<br />\n<br />\nHave you ever been insulted<br />\nwhen someone calls you a Hot<br />\nDog? Well, Nick Daskalakis gets<br />\ncalled hot dog for a living and he<br />\ndoesn't mind it one bit.<br />\nOut of the endless stream of<br />\nimmigrants pouring across from<br />\nthe Old Country in anticipation<br />\nof streets paved with gold, the<br />\naffable Greek instead discovered<br />\nhot-dog-roll lined boulevards here<br />\nin Charm City. \"Polish people are<br />\nthe champion hot dog eaters,\" he<br />\nmused, and everyone knows that<br />\nBaltimore has more than its share<br />\nof Polish descendants.<br />\nNick has been serving up red<br />\nhot wieners at the City Fair for<br />\nthe past four years. Not only has<br />\nhe acquired the reputation for<br />\nbeing a master vendor, he also<br />\nacquired his lovely wife who<br />\nrefused to be named. \"I am<br />\nfascinated by the coincidence<br />\nthat the year after I met my wife<br />\nat the fair, over a beer no less, we<br />\nreturned to the Inner Harbor in<br />\nhopes of peddling our hot dogs,\"<br />\nhe elaborated.<br />\n<br />\nshow entitled People Are The<br />\nKey and a \"Put Your Block On<br />\nThe Map\" exhibit will highlight<br />\nthe Greater Homewood display.<br />\nNearly 110 non-profit<br />\ninstitutions will also operate<br />\nexhibits. Some of the<br />\nparticipants in this category are<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nthe Enoch Pratt Free Library, the<br />\nLegal Aid Bureau, Planned<br />\nParenthood, and the YMCA.<br />\nThe money for the fair's<br />\nexpenses comes primarily from<br />\nbusiness donations raised by the<br />\nCity Fair Board. A spokesman<br />\nfof the fair's Coordinating<br />\nCouncil said, \"Our general hope<br />\nis to break even.

All the songs would<br />\nappeal to hard-core Dylan<br />\npeople, but one got the<br />\ndiscomforting impression that<br />\nthey could have and had been<br />\ndone better. \"Idiot Wind\", the<br />\nfinal number, was the nadir, as<br />\nDylan slipped into the<br />\nmonotonous forced singing<br />\nwhich characterizes Before the<br />\nFlood. The preceding pieces were<br />\nmore tunefully done, but these<br />\nfell into two categories: the<br />\nacoustic songs, on which Dylan<br />\nand Baez usually colloborated,<br />\nholding the verses to unnatural<br />\nlengths while the camera nearly<br />\npoked them in the head; and the<br />\nmore electric versions, on which<br />\nthe Revue paused while Dylan<br />\nfired out a line, and then plunged<br />\nback into a pattern of repetitive<br />\nand uninspiring accompaniment.<br />\nPerhaps the way the songs<br />\nwere done was excusable, even<br />\nthough the performance doesn't<br />\ncompare to Dylan's May 1966<br />\nDublin concert, but TV Guide's<br />\npromotional blurb ironically<br />\npointed up Hard Rain's most<br />\nimportant and frustrating<br />\ninadequacies. The show was<br />\nbilled as a portrait of Dylan, a<br />\n\"multi-faceted view,\" a<br />\nperformance demonstrating that<br />\nDylan has justifiably been<br />\ninterpreted and acclaimed as \"a<br />\nteacher, revolutionary, firebrand,<br />\nmessiah, mystic, prophet.\" The<br />\nview was hardly multi-faceted,<br />\nunless you term alternation<br />\nbetween two camera angles as<br />\nmulti-faceted. The show<br />\nobsfucated the \"real\" Dylan, if it<br />\ndid anything at all in terms ,of a<br />\npersonal portrait. To pretend<br />\nthat the performance revealed<br />\nDylan as a prophet, mystic, et<br />\ncetera is absurd. What did Hard<br />\nRain accomplish in terms of<br />\nexplicating Dylan in any sense?<br />\nLittle if anything. It is extremely<br />\nunfortunate that the appearance,<br />\nballyhooed as it was, was so<br />\npoorly organized and executed,<br />\nand so successful in disguising his<br />\ngenius.<br />\nThat Dylan has been one of<br />\nthe single most important forces<br />\nin popular music few will deny.<br />\nIn the tumultuous sixties, he<br />\ncaptured the spiritual restlessness<br />\nof American youth with a force,<br />\nvision, and clarity which has<br />\nnever been equalled.<br />\nUnquestionably, this is the key<br />\n<br />\nto his success and the essence of<br />\nhis brilliance: Dylan is most of all<br />\nan emotional genius (\"How does<br />\nit fe-e-e-e-e-1??\"). Despite the<br />\nless-than-lustrous quality of his<br />\nvoice, and his imperfect musical<br />\nability, Dylan has become<br />\nfamous on the strength of his<br />\nknack for articulating the<br />\nfrustrations, needs, and problems<br />\nof his generation.<br />\nBut the juxtaposition of<br />\nDylan's greatness and his grating<br />\nTV-special debut point up what<br />\nis probably the most pressing<br />\nissue concerning the Voice of the<br />\nsixties: Is the Dylan of that<br />\nturbulent era merely a pitiful<br />\nanachronism in the seventies,<br />\nhanging onto a reputation built<br />\nten years ago? Or can the<br />\n25-year-old who set the<br />\nAmerican consciousness<br />\nthrobbing with \"A Hard Rain's<br />\nA-Gonna Fall,\" \"Blowin' in the<br />\nWind,\" \"Like a Rolling Stone,\"<br />\nand Blonde on Blonde \"speak\"<br />\nagain at the hoary age of 35?<br />\nBob Dylan and the nineteen<br />\nsixties are inseparable, the mood<br />\nand the man so a part of each<br />\nother, from the Missile Crisis to<br />\nBerkeley (\"Who can separate the<br />\ndancer from the dance?\"). DyIgn<br />\nasked the questions that<br />\nAmerica's youth felt but could<br />\nnot articulate (\"OH, mama, can<br />\nthis really be the end. . .?-), and,<br />\navoiding soothing answers, bared<br />\nthe naked agony of his soul, and<br />\nripped away the veil, standing<br />\nunwound beneath the sky on<br />\nclouds unbound by law, in a<br />\nsoldier's stance aiming his hand<br />\nat the mongrel dogs who taught.<br />\n<br />\nperhaps feeling too much for too<br />\nmany, and now he who has<br />\nalways led the way must decide<br />\nwhether there is anywhere else to<br />\ngo.<br />\nAfter the musical brilliance of<br />\nthe sixties, which was coupled<br />\nwith a rare sense of social<br />\nconsciousness, the seventies haye<br />\nbeen marked by a chilling<br />\ndescent into the sugary<br />\nempty-headed optimism of John<br />\nDenver and Olivia Newton-John<br />\nand the convoluted clanking of<br />\nsuch entries as Led Zeppelin,<br />\nKiss, and the LA. Death Trip,<br />\nnot to mention the usual top-40<br />\nsillylovesongs syndrome. The<br />\nGrateful Dead and The Rolling<br />\nStones hang on with nothing left,<br />\nand groups like Quicksilver<br />\nMessenger Service and the<br />\nerstwhile-Jefferson Airplane roll<br />\nover in their once-respectable<br />\ngraves and attempt to fill the gap.<br />\nPerhaps Dylan has been caught in<br />\nthe post-sixties malaise of<br />\nmediocrity and big-bucks<br />\nstrategems, his thought-dreams<br />\ndisintegrating, his watchtower<br />\nleft abandoned, as the wind<br />\nhowling still louder in the<br />\ndeafening silence, yet unheard.<br />\nMoney talks, Dylan walks<br />\n4L L THAT JAZZ<br />\nIn the past few years some of the best concerts have been sponsored by the city government. Last year's City Fair<br />\npresented Maynard Ferguson, as well as Dave Brubeck and Sons. Last summer's free On Stage Downtown series<br />\nincluded three jazz concerts: Maynard Ferguson, Lionel Hampton, and Charlie Byrd. This year's City Fair (Sept. 17, 18,<br />\n19) will have some local jazz groups on the minor stages, but the big concerts are all on Stage One. These concerts are<br />\nincluded in the $1,25 entrance fee to the fairgrounds (Inner Harbor West). Today, Al Baitch is scheduled at 3:30 p.m.,<br />\nand Joe Williams at 8 p.m. On Saturday the Jimmy Wells Quintet will play at 4:30 p.m., and Benny Goodman brings<br />\nback the memories at 8 p.m. Hank Levy's Towson State Jazz Ensemble will perform on Sunday at 3p.m., with Buddy<br />\nRich scheduled to play at 8 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nBut the sixties are gone<br />\nforever, the times are not<br />\nchanging as they once were, and<br />\ndisillusionment no longer has<br />\neven poignance. With the end of<br />\nthe decade came the end of<br />\nDylan's vision, or so it would<br />\nseem. John Wesley Harding,<br />\nwhich came out in January of<br />\n1968, appears to mark the end of<br />\nDylan's most brilliant periods.<br />\nExcluding the official release of<br />\nThe Basement Tapes in the<br />\nsummer of 1975, ten Dylan<br />\nalbums have been released since<br />\nJohn Wesley Harding, and even<br />\nthe best of these cannot come up<br />\nto his previous work. The<br />\nurgency is gone, an intangible has<br />\nbeen lost, and even though Dylan<br />\naddicts don't know how to quit,<br />\nthere must lurk for them the fear<br />\nthat he in some sense has.<br />\nNow it looks as if Dylan is<br />\ngoing on, writing good music<br />\nwhere he once wrote great music,<br />\nbuilding a ten million dollar<br />\nmansion in California, replacing<br />\nthe aesthetics of vision with the<br />\neconomics of self-enrichment.<br />\nDylan said one time that he<br />\nwould rather die than decay. In a<br />\nrecent TV Guide interview he<br />\nclaimed that he is writing new<br />\nmusic, trying new things.<br />\nHowever, the suspicion is that<br />\nDylan is indeed decaying. No,<br />\nmaybe he was right\u2014maybe he's<br />\nalready dead.<br />\nIn any case, Dylan's position<br />\nhas never been an easy one.

To many Hopkins males,<br />\nthe memory, or anticipation, of<br />\nsuch a sight connotes the glories<br />\nof a one-night conquest, or<br />\nPerhaps a lasting undergraduate<br />\naffair.<br />\nTo me, sun rising over<br />\nGoucher College was a sight I<br />\ncould barely see, for the sunlight<br />\nburst so glaringly through the<br />\nwindows that it blinded me<br />\nWhenever I looked outside. It was<br />\neight a.m. on a December<br />\nmorning last winter. I sat quietly<br />\nin the Goucher Library, intently<br />\nPorin g over Smirnitsky's<br />\nR ussian -English Dictionary,<br />\nstruggling by rote, rather than by<br />\nunderstanding, to translate forty<br />\nRussian sentences into at least<br />\nmediocre English. The task<br />\nbefore me was the completion of<br />\nthree weeks worth of overdue<br />\nassignments by early afternoon,<br />\nall for the purpose of attaining a<br />\n\"B\". And the incentive? The<br />\ngrade would probably make or<br />\nbreak my chances for the Dean's<br />\nList that semester. The professor<br />\nwas from Goucher, and so the<br />\nassignment had to be delivered to<br />\nher office in Van Meter Hall. It<br />\nhad seemed as reasonable a<br />\nventure as any to accomplish my<br />\ntask that morning at Goucher<br />\nLibrary. The notion appealed to<br />\nmy sense of the romantically<br />\nabsurd.<br />\nhad never expected, however,<br />\nthe total desolation I experienced<br />\nas soon as I arrived.<br />\nEveryone<br />\nhad gone: gone home to their<br />\nparents somewhere in American<br />\nSuburbia.<br />\nWhat was left was a<br />\ncampus that can be staggering in<br />\nits sheer<br />\nbeauty\u2014this wide<br />\nexPanse of open, rolling land<br />\nOnly minimally violated by<br />\nscattered two-level halls<br />\nof<br />\na<br />\ncademia. Now that beauty had<br />\nbecome more powerful, more<br />\nn minous, by virtue of its<br />\nunpeopled state, and the dry,<br />\nbiting winter cold that swept<br />\nacross campus.<br />\nI sat, read, referred, and wrote<br />\nfor two hours. My two study<br />\nbreaks consisted of finding and<br />\nrelocating the men's room in the<br />\nbasement. I was half done.<br />\nD ecidin g that this was<br />\nundoubtably a watershed in my<br />\nefforts, I rose and<br />\nwalked over to<br />\na book rack by the couches,<br />\nWhere I spied, then seized a copy<br />\nof Hugh Kenner's T.S. Eliot: The<br />\nInvisible Poet. I had just finished<br />\ntaking Kenner's \"Yeats Pound,<br />\nand Eliot\" course<br />\nthat semester.<br />\nDespite having done virtually no<br />\nLw\u00b0rk in the course,I had \"gotten<br />\nuY.<br />\n' with an augmented paper<br />\n_written the year before.

It<br />\nnever occurred to me to wait<br />\ninside.<br />\nThe semester dragged on for<br />\nanother four days, with two<br />\nall-nighters. I then made a quick<br />\nescape to New York City.<br />\nOf six grades, four were<br />\ntest -case borderline. They all<br />\nwent the right way; I made the<br />\nDean's List.<br />\nNext term, the apathy<br />\nincreased. \"Getting by\" now<br />\nconsisted of attending classes on<br />\nan intermittent basis, and living<br />\nin a room that was decorated<br />\nearly- Armageddon.<br />\nMy need for some form of an<br />\nactive existence was quickly<br />\nsated with the development of a<br />\nfew intriguing personal<br />\nrelationships. There was a vivid<br />\nsense within me that I should<br />\nsomehow go beyond that, but I<br />\nlacked the motivation, or<br />\npossibly the fortitude, to do so.<br />\nControversies<br />\nOn campus, controversies<br />\nraged. I signed a petition<br />\nprotesting the honorary degree<br />\nbestowed upon the Princess<br />\nAshraf of Iran, and donated fifty<br />\ncents for the privilege of wearing<br />\na bracelet which celebrated the<br />\ncause of one Iranian political<br />\nprisoner. Within the day, the<br />\nsweat on my wrist had caused the<br />\nink to run. The legibility of the<br />\ninscription dissolved, and with it<br />\nany fleeting personal sense of<br />\n.social awareness.<br />\nIn late January, prior to the<br />\nAshraf incident, the editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter began pestering me<br />\nto write a major feature on<br />\nHopkins' takeover of the<br />\nBaltimorean Hotel. What was<br />\nwanted was a human interest<br />\nnerloot<br />\n<br />\nnpnnlp<br />\n<br />\napttina<br />\n<br />\nevicted) and an analysis of the<br />\n<br />\n-11\u2022111111,1C\"<br />\n<br />\ntown-gown situation. Recent<br />\neditorials in the News-Letter had<br />\ncome out strongly against<br />\nUniversity expansion.<br />\nMyself, among others, doubted<br />\nthe feasibility of this story as a<br />\nfeature\u2014whether it was there to<br />\nbe written.<br />\nYet it was a week in which I<br />\ncould think of nothing better to<br />\ndo. I took the story. It occurred<br />\nto me that I might end up almost<br />\nhaving to invent angles. But my<br />\nframe of mind had evolved to the<br />\npoint where such idealistic goals<br />\nas \"total journalistic integrity\"<br />\nseemed irrelevant in terms of<br />\npursuable or desirable<br />\nachievements.<br />\nThe feature that I wrote on<br />\nthe Baltimorean did not contain<br />\none single untruth, misquotation,<br />\nor any other overt indication of<br />\nspurious journalism. What it did<br />\ncontain was a series of<br />\nmanipulated scenes, and<br />\nconversations that were<br />\nconsciously overblown and<br />\nunderblown to suit the tone of<br />\nthe article. Of greatest<br />\nconsequence were an elderly<br />\nswitchboard operator who<br />\ndivided her attention equally<br />\nbetween myself and the ABC late<br />\nnight special, and my next door<br />\nneighbor (I live right near the<br />\nBaltimorean), who was just full<br />\nof quotable truisms about<br />\n\"longhairs\" from Hopkins, and<br />\nhow they hurt the neighborhood.<br />\nSuffice it to say that I wrote an<br />\narticle which, however imperfect<br />\nstylistically, provided excellent<br />\nfodder for an \"outraged\"<br />\neditorial decrying Hopkins'<br />\nrepeated violations of the<br />\nsurrounding community.<br />\nNone of which bothered me.<br />\nMy own view of the situation was<br />\npassively pragmatic. I saw<br />\nHopkins as the heavyweight, who<br />\nhad the sheer brute strength to<br />\nbeat up on the lightweight<br />\ncommunity organizations<br />\nvirtually at will. I also perceived<br />\nsuch bullying tactics as<br />\nessentially a mistake, and any<br />\npositive steps taken to improve<br />\ntown-gown relations (which was<br />\n<br />\nbeing done at the time) as being<br />\nhighly desirable. My thinking was<br />\nthat eventually Hopkins was<br />\ngoing to encounter a situation<br />\nthat necessitated some form of<br />\nUniversity expansion, over which<br />\nthe community had total veto<br />\npower, by virtue of a strict<br />\nzoning law, or the like. And if at<br />\nthat time the Greater Homewood<br />\nCommunity Corporation had<br />\nexperienced nothing but being<br />\npushed around,they would never<br />\ngive in.<br />\nI saw nothing inherently venal<br />\nin the purchase of the<br />\nBaltimorean, which had been<br />\nobtained for the purpose of<br />\nhousing graduate studentc<br />\nnudged out of McCoy by<br />\nundergraduates. But to the<br />\nextent that the property had<br />\nbeen usurped from the<br />\ncommunity, and not bargained<br />\nfor, the operation had been a<br />\ndiplomatic blunder.<br />\nSo what? My opinion. Never<br />\nexpressed in the feature, and so<br />\nof no consequence. After all, I<br />\nhad written the story they had<br />\ntold me to write. I had gotten by.<br />\nThat's all that matters. Right?<br />\nThen Faulkner (a la A Rose<br />\nFor Emily) came to North<br />\nCharles Street. A fifty year old<br />\nwoman named Ann Baker had<br />\nbeen living in near-total seclusion<br />\nfor thirteen years, seen only by<br />\nher priest and by a delivery man<br />\nfrom the Greenway Pharmacy.<br />\nShe was a recluse, living only<br />\nwith room-high piles of garbage.<br />\nAnd she didn't want to leave. So<br />\nwhen she was told that she had<br />\nto go, she feigned acquiensence,<br />\nand then lit the garbage with a<br />\nmatch. And Ann Baker died.<br />\nThe next day the News-Letter<br />\ncame out with a lead article on<br />\nAnn Baker's death accompanied<br />\nby an angry, vindictive editorial.<br />\nThe pieces combined to imply<br />\none simple statement: Hopkins<br />\nkilled Ann Baker.<br />\nI was stunned. The conclusion<br />\nwas specious. For this reason:<br />\nAnn Baker predetermined her<br />\nown death. Thirteen years<br />\nbefore, she had carefully begun<br />\n<br />\nto construct an existence which<br />\ncould never have tolerated<br />\nexposure to the external world.<br />\nHopkins' eviction did force the<br />\ncrisis, and so the suicide (her one<br />\nalternative for an absolute<br />\nrebellion against reality). But the<br />\ncrisis probably would have been<br />\nforced anyway, by some other<br />\nagency, because THE<br />\nBALTIMOREAN WAS FOR<br />\nSALE. It is a definite possibility<br />\nthat WHOEVER had bought that<br />\nbuilding might have evicted Ann<br />\nBaker. And so killed her?<br />\nOne can only guess at the<br />\nreasoning of the News-Letter<br />\nstaff. It seems legitimate to say,<br />\nhowever, that the Ann Baker<br />\neditorial was \u2022 just a natural<br />\nconsequence of the continuing<br />\nseries of articles and editorials<br />\nconcerning the Baltimorean. And<br />\nthe longest, and perhaps most<br />\nwidely read of those articles. ..<br />\nI wrote.<br />\nAnd hadn't believed in.<br />\nAnd had written anyway.<br />\nJust to get by.<br />\nIn righteous anger, I decided<br />\nto fire off an angry response to<br />\nthe editors. I never did.<br />\nSince then, the issue has died,<br />\nin a manner somewhat quieter<br />\nthan the death of Ann Baker.<br />\nTo me, however, there is a<br />\ndifferent issue, one that has little<br />\nto do with Hopkins housing,<br />\ntown-gown politics, or whatever.<br />\nIt is an issue which has not died<br />\nin my mind.<br />\nThe issue is the reconstruction<br />\nof one's frame of mind, to the<br />\npoint where it can be resolved:<br />\n\" I will not spend this life<br />\n'getting by.\"<br />\nThe issue is the need to<br />\nawaken to what is around you. If<br />\nthe Hopkins existence is to be a<br />\nlegitimate one,it cannot be spent<br />\nignoring three-quarters of the<br />\nuniversity because, \"Why should<br />\nI care. . .\", \"I don't fit in with<br />\nthat. ..\",\"Those people couldn't<br />\ncare about me. ..\",\"The girls on<br />\nthis campus are too obnoxious. .<br />\n.\", \"The boys on this campus<br />\ncan't accept intelligent women. .<br />\n.\", \"Yeah, philosophy's<br />\nrnterestmg, but it's bullshit, and<br />\nbesides it won't help me get into<br />\nmed school...\"<br />\nForfeit<br />\nHow many have loved physics,<br />\nbut no longer think about it,just<br />\nblindly take notes and memorize,<br />\njust to get by?

At the service, Mao, who died last week at the<br />\nage<br />\nof 82, was the subject of numerous tributes and<br />\nexpressions<br />\nof admiration and thanks for the tremendous<br />\nrevolutionary<br />\nchange through which he helped guide the Chinese people<br />\nin<br />\nthe last sixty years.<br />\nA central feature of Mao's life was his<br />\nconstant,<br />\nunwavering dedication to serving his Chinese countryme<br />\nn.<br />\nTheoretician, statesman, military leader, and educator were<br />\nbut some of the forms this service took. Although the<br />\nhas been long, difficult and not without mistakes, road<br />\neven<br />\nWestern observers must admit that the quality of life in<br />\nChina<br />\nhas been dramatically upgraded under Mao's leadershi<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nBut in the end, Mao wanted to be remembered primarily as<br />\na teacher. Perhaps more than any other modern figure, Mao<br />\nwas able to communicate a dynamic, integrated<br />\nunderstanding of how the world works and how people can<br />\nchange it. While most of his theories and accomplishments<br />\nrun counter to the American ethic, they are well worth<br />\nconsidering in light of the tremendous influence they have<br />\nexerted on people throughout the world. And perhaps more<br />\nthan anything else, Mao should be bailed for illustrating that<br />\na betterment of the human condition need not be an idle,<br />\nutopian dream, but, through a common, sustained effort, can<br />\nbecome gratifying reality.<br />\n<br />\nCaptain Bligh<br />\n<br />\nThe University:for whose end?<br />\nWe need a sense of morality<br />\nBy MARK HERTSGAARD<br />\n\"What is this university supposed to<br />\nbe?\"<br />\nAfter more than a week of<br />\n\"orientation\", the same conversations<br />\n(where you from, what's your major,<br />\nwhat are you taking, etc.), and official<br />\nwelcomes from university luminaries<br />\nof various intensities, that question, or<br />\nvariations of it, has probably been<br />\npondered by many a freshman.<br />\nAlthough perhaps to a lesser extent,<br />\nupperclassmen may be considering the<br />\nsame query as they come progressively<br />\ncloser to graduation. Seniors can<br />\nhardly avoid the matter since<br />\neveryone they talk to asks the<br />\ninevitable question regarding their<br />\nplans after leaving Hopkins. Of course,<br />\nthe answer depends largely on what a<br />\nsenior has already done at this<br />\nuniversity and how well it has met<br />\nhis/her needs.<br />\nAt the root of most of the<br />\nchallenges against the traditionalist<br />\nview of the university has been the<br />\ndisturbing realization that a college<br />\neducation no longer assures a<br />\ngood<br />\njob\" in today's society. In her book,<br />\nThe Case Against College, Caroline<br />\nBird argues that many high school<br />\ngraduates can fare better financially<br />\nby going to work and saving the<br />\nthousands of would-be tuition dollars.<br />\nIn the face of such criticism. Johns<br />\nHopkins President Steven Muller has<br />\ncalled for the goals of American<br />\nuniversities to be reoriented toward<br />\nhigher learning and away from mere<br />\nhigher skilling. While preparation for<br />\nfuture jobs would still remain a<br />\nfixture of the college years, the<br />\nprimary purpose of university<br />\ninstruction and study must be to<br />\nproduce graduates who are highly<br />\neducated.<br />\nOf course, the role of the university<br />\nis always partly determined by the<br />\nconstraints of the society in which it<br />\nexists. The purposes of universities in<br />\n1976 America differ markedly from<br />\nthose of colonial times when<br />\ninstitutions of higher education<br />\nproduced mainly clergy and teachers.<br />\nColleges and universities by and large<br />\nremained establishments reserved for<br />\nthe intellectually and socially elite<br />\nwell into the tweatieth century. But<br />\naround the time of World Vvar II, and<br />\ncorresponding to the ever increasing<br />\nneeds for educated, technical<br />\npersonnel to run the rapidly<br />\ndeveloping American economy, higher<br />\neducation began to be democratized.<br />\nThe numbers of college students and,<br />\nconsequently, also their diversity in<br />\nterms of race and class,nottceably<br />\nincreased. The university began to be<br />\nperceived as an institution that<br />\npumped out the graduates necessary<br />\nto keep America moving forward in<br />\nthe modern age.<br />\n<br />\nAs Alvin Toffler wrote in Future<br />\nShock, \"Mass education was the<br />\ningenious machine constructed by<br />\nindustrialism to produce the kind of<br />\nadults it needed to run industrial<br />\nsociety. . .Yet the whole idea of<br />\nassembling masses of students (raw<br />\nmaterial) to be processed by teachers<br />\n(workers) in a centrally located school<br />\n(factory) was a stroke of industrial<br />\ngenius.\" Although Toffler was writing<br />\nin regard to the time period of the<br />\nIndustrial Revolution, the parallels to<br />\ntoday are obvious. In fact, much of<br />\nthe student protest of the 1960's was<br />\ndirected against the regimentation,<br />\nalienation and authoritarianism of<br />\nhigher education and the society<br />\nwhich it reflected.<br />\nNow, as we move through the<br />\n1970's, it is more common for<br />\nstudents to question the purposes of<br />\nhigher education in more<br />\nself-centered, career oriented terms.<br />\nWill it give me a better job? Is it worth<br />\nall that money?<br />\nIt is exceedingly important for us<br />\nto remember that views on the<br />\npurpose and the role of the university<br />\ngreatly depend on one's perspective<br />\non and relationship to it. Rest assured<br />\nthat a rising student politico's and a<br />\npre-med's views differ substantially<br />\nand that their difference is small when<br />\ncompared to that between a staff<br />\ncustodian and a university trustee.<br />\nConsider als9 the contrast between<br />\nhow major corporations and<br />\ncommunity residents conceive of<br />\nuniversities and their members.<br />\nIn spite of these individual<br />\ndifferences, the world of academia is<br />\nstill permeated by the comfortable.<br />\nconventional view of the role of the<br />\nuniversity. The university is seen as a<br />\ncenter of culture, free thinking and<br />\nindependent, oective research and<br />\ninstruction. The uni\u2022<br />\n:s<br />\nsometimes considered to<br />\n\u201e sort of<br />\nenlightened, benevolent servant who<br />\nearns his keep in society by helping us<br />\nbetter to understand and confront the<br />\nworld and by tackling the tough<br />\nproblems that impede human<br />\nprogress.<br />\nIn judging the aptness of this<br />\ndescription, two suggestions may<br />\nprove helpful. First, in making any<br />\nsocial judgment, perhaps the most<br />\nuseful questions to ask are: who is<br />\nhurt, who is helped, how, and why?<br />\nSecond, the judgments again depend<br />\nlargely on whose perspective (e.g.,<br />\nstudent, faculty or society) is<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nFor the well-directed, career<br />\noriented undergrad, Johns Hopkins<br />\nprovides one of the finest educations<br />\nin the country; that is, the JHU<br />\neducation will help its recipient along<br />\nthe road to grad school, a respectable,<br />\nand perhaps even interesting, job, and<br />\nultimately to American success. But<br />\nbefore lauding Hopkins on this<br />\naccomplishment, we must consider<br />\nthe nature of this success. In this<br />\ncontext, success can be seen as<br />\nimplying the wealth, prestige and<br />\nsecurity that usually accompany<br />\nupper middle class existence. But<br />\nwhat about the notion of service to<br />\nsociety? Is an M.D. degree to be<br />\nviewed as an unofficial license to print<br />\nmoney or rather as an opportunity to<br />\nserve society in a special capacity?<br />\nWhile students participate almost<br />\nexclusively in the second of the<br />\nuniversity's major functions, as the<br />\nrecipients of teaching, professors<br />\nengage in both teaching and research.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the professors most<br />\nesteemed by the university are those<br />\nwho bring fame and prestige (and,<br />\ntherefore, plenty of research funds) to<br />\nHopkins; i.e., the well renowned<br />\nresearch scholars. Some of these men<br />\nand women are also fine, dedicated<br />\neducators, a happy combination for<br />\nall concerned. Some are not. But for<br />\nthose faculty members who do not<br />\nexcel in the \"publish of perish\" game,<br />\nreceiving tenure is almost impossible if<br />\nhe/she is judged by colleagues in the<br />\nacademic world not to be in the top<br />\ntwenty percent in his/her field. This<br />\npriority of research over teaching<br />\nclearly has negative ramifications on<br />\nthe quality of instruction at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nBut we must probe beyond these<br />\nramifications to try to determine what<br />\nthis priority says about the nature of<br />\nJohns Hopkins and other universities.<br />\nIt indicates that the primary allegiance<br />\nof the university and many of its<br />\nfaculty must be toward the kind of<br />\nresearch that will attract substantial<br />\ngrant monies. A research project or an<br />\ninnovative program cannot be run if<br />\nno funds are available. And what kind<br />\nof research fits this definition? Often,<br />\nand obviously, it must be the kind<br />\nthat will serve those wealthy and<br />\npowerful interests (big corporations,<br />\nthe government, etc.) who can afford<br />\nto sponsor it. This should not be seen<br />\nas surprising. How reasonable is it to<br />\nexpect that profit-conscious<br />\norganizations will squander money on<br />\nresearch that is of little or no use to<br />\nthem?<br />\nThese practices and relationships<br />\nhave very definite implications on<br />\nhow and who the university serves in<br />\nits cotnmunity and society. To<br />\ncontinue to exist, a primary concern<br />\nof Johns Hopkins and other<br />\nuniversities must be to stay in the<br />\ngood graces of the rich and powerful.<br />\nThe conducting of research that serves<br />\nthose interests is a major, but not the<br />\nonly, tool at the disposal of a<br />\nuniversity. These priorities, which<br />\ndictate that much of the research in<br />\nAmerican universities be oriented<br />\ntoward such areas as weapons<br />\ndevelopment rather than projects that<br />\nwill help those most in need, are<br />\nsimilar to those that cause the<br />\ngovernment to spend a<br />\ndisproportionate amount of national<br />\ndefense at the expense of rural health<br />\nservices. The challenging by<br />\nuniversities of this \"them that has.<br />\ngits\" status quo is not encouraged.<br />\nThis is not meant to imply that a<br />\nuniversity performs no useful<br />\nfunctions. Nor should one get the<br />\nimpression that university, corporate<br />\nand governmental officials spend all<br />\ntheir waking hours plotting to exploit<br />\nthe poor. Such \u2018Tiotild be an<br />\ninsensitive, shallow and naive<br />\njudgement. Qn the contrary, there are<br />\nmany instances when useful services<br />\nhave been performed by people within<br />\nthe university. I3ut in aggregate, no<br />\n<br />\nmistaken judgement can be made. A<br />\nuniversity cannot serve two masters<br />\nand, when forced to choose, cannot<br />\nafford to bite the hand that feeds it.<br />\nSome may counter this line of<br />\nreasoning with the argument (often<br />\nheard during last year's Iranian<br />\ndemonstrations) that a university<br />\nmust play this unfortunate game if it<br />\nis to remain solvent. That's the way<br />\nthe system is, the way the world<br />\noperates. If the university is to exist<br />\nand hope to serve society, it must<br />\nsometimes accept money for some<br />\nresearch activities that are ethically<br />\nquestionable. Such people sometimes<br />\neven admit that this practice cheapens<br />\nthe integrity of the university, but<br />\nwould consider it to be a necessary<br />\nevil that is traded off against the good<br />\nthat the urliversity can do. This<br />\ncounter-argument is correct in one<br />\nvery important point\u2014yes, the system,<br />\nthe constraints of modern, Western<br />\nsociety, does demand that universities<br />\nperform this way. However, this<br />\nargument errs by limply accepting<br />\nthese practices as regrettable<br />\nnecessities rather than questioning the<br />\nmorality and legitimacy of the system<br />\nthat produces them.<br />\n<br />\n\fse<br />\nat<br />\nof<br />\n;s.<br />\nce<br />\nLts<br />\nof<br />\nal<br />\nin<br />\nif<br />\n<br />\nid<br />\n<br />\nn,<br />\n<br />\nid<br />\ns,<br />\n.d<br />\n;r1<br />\n:o<br />\n<br />\nIs<br />\n<br />\nby Sky King<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nGregory the Airplane (You were expecting \"Songbird\".<br />\nperlwps?) flew again this weekend.

The<br />\nopponent maintained excellent<br />\nball control throughout the<br />\ngame, thereby calling the Jay's<br />\ndefense to meet the challenge.<br />\nIn the first half a George<br />\nWashington break away was<br />\nhalted by the quick hands of a<br />\n.11-1U fullback who pulled down<br />\nthe potential scorer. When the<br />\noPponent failed on the penalty<br />\noPportunity the Blue Jays were<br />\nout of trouble. Later in the<br />\nsecond half it was goalie Ken<br />\nSuesse who stopped a GW threat<br />\nby just tipping away another<br />\nbeautifully placed direct kick.<br />\nWith the big opening game<br />\nagainst Haverford only a few<br />\ndays away, Coach Bob Oliver<br />\nthought it wise to rest his starting<br />\noffensive line trio of Greg<br />\nC unningham, Larry<br />\nMcGowan,<br />\n<br />\nand Hyam Levin. Without this<br />\nextra scoring punch in the lineup<br />\nit was difficult for the JHUers to<br />\ngenerate any offensive threats,<br />\nthough they did muster a few.<br />\nAbout a quarter of the way<br />\ninto the second half the Blue<br />\nJays were able to put pressure on<br />\nthe George Washington goal<br />\ntender. Some unnecessary<br />\ndramatics on the part of the GW<br />\ngoalie allowed the ball to squirt<br />\nloose in front of the net and if it<br />\nhadn't been for the experienced<br />\nfeet of the GW defenders, the<br />\nJays would have found<br />\nthemselves right back in the<br />\nballgame.<br />\nOn another occasion lineman<br />\nJoe Siemek was able to gain<br />\ncontrol of the loose ball and send<br />\na looping shot right on net. The<br />\nGW goalie was able to recover<br />\njust in time in order to bat away<br />\nthe potential goal.<br />\nJHU's last scoring opportunity<br />\ncame with only seconds left in<br />\nthe game. Gary Ignatowski was<br />\nfed a beautiful slide pass that left<br />\nhim ten yards out, one on one<br />\nagainst the goalie. But again the<br />\nJays were turned away by a<br />\npretty save.<br />\nCoach Oliver was pleased with<br />\nthis final game as he was with the<br />\nentire soccer preseason.<br />\nAccording to him his entire<br />\nsubstitution bench showed poise<br />\nIFV:a<br />\n<br />\ng<br />\noriginal study materials<br />\nsmall groups \u2022 tape center<br />\n37 years of success<br />\nCALL<br />\n(202)<br />\n244-3010 M<br />\nEDUCATIONAL CENTER<br />\n4201 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.<br />\nWashington, D.C. 20008<br />\n<br />\n3tA3:513:<br />\n1 AIZA=SI<br />\n<br />\n-c<br />\n<br />\nCO<br />\n<br />\nCr)<br />\n<br />\nAlthough it may seem to be<br />\nthe wrong season of the year,<br />\nthere will be plenty of lacrosse<br />\nexcitement on Homewood Field<br />\ntomorrow night.<br />\nThe action will be provided by<br />\nthe Fourth Annual Superstar<br />\nLacrosse Game sponsored by the<br />\nLacrosse Foundation, Inc. and<br />\nwill begin at 8:30.<br />\nPitting last year's College<br />\nAll -Stars against their<br />\ncounterparts from the Clubs, the<br />\ncontest will be a good<br />\nintroduction to the sport for<br />\nthose newcomers to Baltimore<br />\nand/or lacrosse and an excellent<br />\nopportunity to see many of last<br />\nyear's star players once again.<br />\n<br />\n3105 St. Paul St.<br />\n<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br />\nThe Sunday Experience<br />\n<br />\n467-7882<br />\n<br />\nA Presentation By<br />\nDr. JOHN WALTON<br />\n<br />\nNe$43:533:S11:5SMITZ131:33:53=3*/<br />\n1<br />\nAtill=fa,Z37:53StfSIMEJ<br />\n<br />\nNAT'L MEDICAL BDS.<br />\nFLEX \u2022 ECFMG \u2022 DAT<br />\n<br />\nMCA<br />\nT<br />\nwith confidenc<br />\n<br />\nFULL LINE RECORD STORE<br />\n........with a complete<br />\nstock of classical, rock,imports.<br />\npopular&<br />\n\u2014jazz!!!!<br />\n<br />\n\u20144<br />\nf<br />\nc<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\nACADEMIC<br />\nRESEARCH<br />\nPAPERS<br />\n<br />\n\"\"011111/'<br />\n<br />\n03<br />\n<br />\nDISCOUNT I<br />\nPRICES<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nTHOUSANDS ON FILE<br />\n<br />\nEXTRA DISCOUNT<br />\noff on any, TWQ,<br />\nIp's or tapes<br />\nI<br />\nWith this ad- - -<br />\n<br />\n\u2022v.<br />\n\u2022-..<br />\n<br />\nON AD PER CUSTOMER<br />\n<br />\nSend $1.00 for your up-to-date,<br />\n192-page, mail order catalog.<br />\n<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br />\n<br />\nKUNDALINI YOGA<br />\nAND<br />\nMEDITATION<br />\nRelax your body<br />\nQuiet your mind<br />\nRefresh your spirit<br />\n<br />\nAt the Kundalini Yoga Center,<br />\n2322 N.

All the songs would<br />\nappeal to hard-core Dylan<br />\npeople, but one got the<br />\ndiscomforting impression that<br />\nthey could have and had been<br />\ndone better. \"Idiot Wind\", the<br />\nfinal number, was the nadir, as<br />\nDylan slipped into the<br />\nmonotonous forced singing<br />\nwhich characterizes Before the<br />\nFlood. The preceding pieces were<br />\nmore tunefully done, but these<br />\nfell into two categories: the<br />\nacoustic songs, on which Dylan<br />\nand Baez usually colloborated,<br />\nholding the verses to unnatural<br />\nlengths while the camera nearly<br />\npoked them in the head; and the<br />\nmore electric versions, on which<br />\nthe Revue paused while Dylan<br />\nfired out a line, and then plunged<br />\nback into a pattern of repetitive<br />\nand uninspiring accompaniment.<br />\nPerhaps the way the songs<br />\nwere done was excusable, even<br />\nthough the performance doesn't<br />\ncompare to Dylan's May 1966<br />\nDublin concert, but TV Guide's<br />\npromotional blurb ironically<br />\npointed up Hard Rain's most<br />\nimportant and frustrating<br />\ninadequacies. The show was<br />\nbilled as a portrait of Dylan, a<br />\n\"multi-faceted view,\" a<br />\nperformance demonstrating that<br />\nDylan has justifiably been<br />\ninterpreted and acclaimed as \"a<br />\nteacher, revolutionary, firebrand,<br />\nmessiah, mystic, prophet.\" The<br />\nview was hardly multi-faceted,<br />\nunless you term alternation<br />\nbetween two camera angles as<br />\nmulti-faceted. The show<br />\nobsfucated the \"real\" Dylan, if it<br />\ndid anything at all in terms ,of a<br />\npersonal portrait. To pretend<br />\nthat the performance revealed<br />\nDylan as a prophet, mystic, et<br />\ncetera is absurd. What did Hard<br />\nRain accomplish in terms of<br />\nexplicating Dylan in any sense?<br />\nLittle if anything. It is extremely<br />\nunfortunate that the appearance,<br />\nballyhooed as it was, was so<br />\npoorly organized and executed,<br />\nand so successful in disguising his<br />\ngenius.<br />\nThat Dylan has been one of<br />\nthe single most important forces<br />\nin popular music few will deny.<br />\nIn the tumultuous sixties, he<br />\ncaptured the spiritual restlessness<br />\nof American youth with a force,<br />\nvision, and clarity which has<br />\nnever been equalled.<br />\nUnquestionably, this is the key<br /><br />\nto his success and the essence of<br />\nhis brilliance: Dylan is most of all<br />\nan emotional genius (\"How does<br />\nit fe-e-e-e-e-1??\"). Despite the<br />\nless-than-lustrous quality of his<br />\nvoice, and his imperfect musical<br />\nability, Dylan has become<br />\nfamous on the strength of his<br />\nknack for articulating the<br />\nfrustrations, needs, and problems<br />\nof his generation.<br />\nBut the juxtaposition of<br />\nDylan's greatness and his grating<br />\nTV-special debut point up what<br />\nis probably the most pressing<br />\nissue concerning the Voice of the<br />\nsixties: Is the Dylan of that<br />\nturbulent era merely a pitiful<br />\nanachronism in the seventies,<br />\nhanging onto a reputation built<br />\nten years ago? Or can the<br />\n25-year-old who set the<br />\nAmerican consciousness<br />\nthrobbing with \"A Hard Rain's<br />\nA-Gonna Fall,\" \"Blowin' in the<br />\nWind,\" \"Like a Rolling Stone,\"<br />\nand Blonde on Blonde \"speak\"<br />\nagain at the hoary age of 35?<br />\nBob Dylan and the nineteen<br />\nsixties are inseparable, the mood<br />\nand the man so a part of each<br />\nother, from the Missile Crisis to<br />\nBerkeley (\"Who can separate the<br />\ndancer from the dance?\"). DyIgn<br />\nasked the questions that<br />\nAmerica's youth felt but could<br />\nnot articulate (\"OH, mama, can<br />\nthis really be the end. . .?-), and,<br />\navoiding soothing answers, bared<br />\nthe naked agony of his soul, and<br />\nripped away the veil, standing<br />\nunwound beneath the sky on<br />\nclouds unbound by law, in a<br />\nsoldier's stance aiming his hand<br />\nat the mongrel dogs who taught.<br /><br />\nperhaps feeling too much for too<br />\nmany, and now he who has<br />\nalways led the way must decide<br />\nwhether there is anywhere else to<br />\ngo.<br />\nAfter the musical brilliance of<br />\nthe sixties, which was coupled<br />\nwith a rare sense of social<br />\nconsciousness, the seventies haye<br />\nbeen marked by a chilling<br />\ndescent into the sugary<br />\nempty-headed optimism of John<br />\nDenver and Olivia Newton-John<br />\nand the convoluted clanking of<br />\nsuch entries as Led Zeppelin,<br />\nKiss, and the LA.

This year's City Fair (Sept. 17, 18,<br />\n19) will have some local jazz groups on the minor stages, but the big concerts are all on Stage One. These concerts are<br />\nincluded in the $1,25 entrance fee to the fairgrounds (Inner Harbor West). Today, Al Baitch is scheduled at 3:30 p.m.,<br />\nand Joe Williams at 8 p.m. On Saturday the Jimmy Wells Quintet will play at 4:30 p.m., and Benny Goodman brings<br />\nback the memories at 8 p.m. Hank Levy's Towson State Jazz Ensemble will perform on Sunday at 3p.m., with Buddy<br />\nRich scheduled to play at 8 p.m.<br /><br />\nBut the sixties are gone<br />\nforever, the times are not<br />\nchanging as they once were, and<br />\ndisillusionment no longer has<br />\neven poignance. With the end of<br />\nthe decade came the end of<br />\nDylan's vision, or so it would<br />\nseem. John Wesley Harding,<br />\nwhich came out in January of<br />\n1968, appears to mark the end of<br />\nDylan's most brilliant periods.<br />\nExcluding the official release of<br />\nThe Basement Tapes in the<br />\nsummer of 1975, ten Dylan<br />\nalbums have been released since<br />\nJohn Wesley Harding, and even<br />\nthe best of these cannot come up<br />\nto his previous work. The<br />\nurgency is gone, an intangible has<br />\nbeen lost, and even though Dylan<br />\naddicts don't know how to quit,<br />\nthere must lurk for them the fear<br />\nthat he in some sense has.<br />\nNow it looks as if Dylan is<br />\ngoing on, writing good music<br />\nwhere he once wrote great music,<br />\nbuilding a ten million dollar<br />\nmansion in California, replacing<br />\nthe aesthetics of vision with the<br />\neconomics of self-enrichment.<br />\nDylan said one time that he<br />\nwould rather die than decay.

To many Hopkins males,<br />\nthe memory, or anticipation, of<br />\nsuch a sight connotes the glories<br />\nof a one-night conquest, or<br />\nPerhaps a lasting undergraduate<br />\naffair.<br />\nTo me, sun rising over<br />\nGoucher College was a sight I<br />\ncould barely see, for the sunlight<br />\nburst so glaringly through the<br />\nwindows that it blinded me<br />\nWhenever I looked outside. It was<br />\neight a.m. on a December<br />\nmorning last winter. I sat quietly<br />\nin the Goucher Library, intently<br />\nPorin g over Smirnitsky's<br />\nR ussian -English Dictionary,<br />\nstruggling by rote, rather than by<br />\nunderstanding, to translate forty<br />\nRussian sentences into at least<br />\nmediocre English. The task<br />\nbefore me was the completion of<br />\nthree weeks worth of overdue<br />\nassignments by early afternoon,<br />\nall for the purpose of attaining a<br />\n\"B\". And the incentive? The<br />\ngrade would probably make or<br />\nbreak my chances for the Dean's<br />\nList that semester. The professor<br />\nwas from Goucher, and so the<br />\nassignment had to be delivered to<br />\nher office in Van Meter Hall. It<br />\nhad seemed as reasonable a<br />\nventure as any to accomplish my<br />\ntask that morning at Goucher<br />\nLibrary. The notion appealed to<br />\nmy sense of the romantically<br />\nabsurd.<br />\nhad never expected, however,<br />\nthe total desolation I experienced<br />\nas soon as I arrived.<br />\nEveryone<br />\nhad gone: gone home to their<br />\nparents somewhere in American<br />\nSuburbia.<br />\nWhat was left was a<br />\ncampus that can be staggering in<br />\nits sheer<br />\nbeauty\u2014this wide<br />\nexPanse of open, rolling land<br />\nOnly minimally violated by<br />\nscattered two-level halls<br />\nof<br />\na<br />\ncademia. Now that beauty had<br />\nbecome more powerful, more<br />\nn minous, by virtue of its<br />\nunpeopled state, and the dry,<br />\nbiting winter cold that swept<br />\nacross campus.<br />\nI sat, read, referred, and wrote<br />\nfor two hours. My two study<br />\nbreaks consisted of finding and<br />\nrelocating the men's room in the<br />\nbasement. I was half done.<br />\nD ecidin g that this was<br />\nundoubtably a watershed in my<br />\nefforts, I rose and<br />\nwalked over to<br />\na book rack by the couches,<br />\nWhere I spied, then seized a copy<br />\nof Hugh Kenner's T.S.

I had just finished<br />\ntaking Kenner's \"Yeats Pound,<br />\nand Eliot\" course<br />\nthat semester.<br />\nDespite having done virtually no<br />\nLw\u00b0rk in the course,I had \"gotten<br />\nuY.<br />\n' with an augmented paper<br />\n_written the year before.

A vacant face in<br />\nthe switchboard booth at<br />\nStimson Hall told me that the<br />\nnext bus arrived in half an hour.<br />\nSo I lumbered back to Van<br />\nMeter, sat out on the steps for<br />\ntwenty-five minutec, and froze. It<br />\nnever occurred to me to wait<br />\ninside.<br />\nThe semester dragged on for<br />\nanother four days, with two<br />\nall-nighters. I then made a quick<br />\nescape to New York City.<br />\nOf six grades, four were<br />\ntest -case borderline. They all<br />\nwent the right way; I made the<br />\nDean's List.<br />\nNext term, the apathy<br />\nincreased. \"Getting by\" now<br />\nconsisted of attending classes on<br />\nan intermittent basis, and living<br />\nin a room that was decorated<br />\nearly- Armageddon.<br />\nMy need for some form of an<br />\nactive existence was quickly<br />\nsated with the development of a<br />\nfew intriguing personal<br />\nrelationships. There was a vivid<br />\nsense within me that I should<br />\nsomehow go beyond that, but I<br />\nlacked the motivation, or<br />\npossibly the fortitude, to do so.<br />\nControversies<br />\nOn campus, controversies<br />\nraged. I signed a petition<br />\nprotesting the honorary degree<br />\nbestowed upon the Princess<br />\nAshraf of Iran, and donated fifty<br />\ncents for the privilege of wearing<br />\na bracelet which celebrated the<br />\ncause of one Iranian political<br />\nprisoner. Within the day, the<br />\nsweat on my wrist had caused the<br />\nink to run. The legibility of the<br />\ninscription dissolved, and with it<br />\nany fleeting personal sense of<br />\n.social awareness.<br />\nIn late January, prior to the<br />\nAshraf incident, the editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter began pestering me<br />\nto write a major feature on<br />\nHopkins' takeover of the<br />\nBaltimorean Hotel. What was<br />\nwanted was a human interest<br />\nnerloot<br /><br />\nnpnnlp<br /><br />\napttina<br /><br />\nevicted) and an analysis of the<br /><br />\n-11\u2022111111,1C\"<br /><br />\ntown-gown situation. Recent<br />\neditorials in the News-Letter had<br />\ncome out strongly against<br />\nUniversity expansion.<br />\nMyself, among others, doubted<br />\nthe feasibility of this story as a<br />\nfeature\u2014whether it was there to<br />\nbe written.<br />\nYet it was a week in which I<br />\ncould think of nothing better to<br />\ndo. I took the story. It occurred<br />\nto me that I might end up almost<br />\nhaving to invent angles. But my<br />\nframe of mind had evolved to the<br />\npoint where such idealistic goals<br />\nas \"total journalistic integrity\"<br />\nseemed irrelevant in terms of<br />\npursuable or desirable<br />\nachievements.<br />\nThe feature that I wrote on<br />\nthe Baltimorean did not contain<br />\none single untruth, misquotation,<br />\nor any other overt indication of<br />\nspurious journalism. What it did<br />\ncontain was a series of<br />\nmanipulated scenes, and<br />\nconversations that were<br />\nconsciously overblown and<br />\nunderblown to suit the tone of<br />\nthe article. Of greatest<br />\nconsequence were an elderly<br />\nswitchboard operator who<br />\ndivided her attention equally<br />\nbetween myself and the ABC late<br />\nnight special, and my next door<br />\nneighbor (I live right near the<br />\nBaltimorean), who was just full<br />\nof quotable truisms about<br />\n\"longhairs\" from Hopkins, and<br />\nhow they hurt the neighborhood.<br />\nSuffice it to say that I wrote an<br />\narticle which, however imperfect<br />\nstylistically, provided excellent<br />\nfodder for an \"outraged\"<br />\neditorial decrying Hopkins'<br />\nrepeated violations of the<br />\nsurrounding community.<br />\nNone of which bothered me.<br />\nMy own view of the situation was<br />\npassively pragmatic. I saw<br />\nHopkins as the heavyweight, who<br />\nhad the sheer brute strength to<br />\nbeat up on the lightweight<br />\ncommunity organizations<br />\nvirtually at will. I also perceived<br />\nsuch bullying tactics as<br />\nessentially a mistake, and any<br />\npositive steps taken to improve<br />\ntown-gown relations (which was<br /><br />\nbeing done at the time) as being<br />\nhighly desirable. My thinking was<br />\nthat eventually Hopkins was<br />\ngoing to encounter a situation<br />\nthat necessitated some form of<br />\nUniversity expansion, over which<br />\nthe community had total veto<br />\npower, by virtue of a strict<br />\nzoning law, or the like. And if at<br />\nthat time the Greater Homewood<br />\nCommunity Corporation had<br />\nexperienced nothing but being<br />\npushed around,they would never<br />\ngive in.<br />\nI saw nothing inherently venal<br />\nin the purchase of the<br />\nBaltimorean, which had been<br />\nobtained for the purpose of<br />\nhousing graduate studentc<br />\nnudged out of McCoy by<br />\nundergraduates. But to the<br />\nextent that the property had<br />\nbeen usurped from the<br />\ncommunity, and not bargained<br />\nfor, the operation had been a<br />\ndiplomatic blunder.<br />\nSo what? My opinion. Never<br />\nexpressed in the feature, and so<br />\nof no consequence. After all, I<br />\nhad written the story they had<br />\ntold me to write. I had gotten by.<br />\nThat's all that matters. Right?<br />\nThen Faulkner (a la A Rose<br />\nFor Emily) came to North<br />\nCharles Street. A fifty year old<br />\nwoman named Ann Baker had<br />\nbeen living in near-total seclusion<br />\nfor thirteen years, seen only by<br />\nher priest and by a delivery man<br />\nfrom the Greenway Pharmacy.<br />\nShe was a recluse, living only<br />\nwith room-high piles of garbage.<br />\nAnd she didn't want to leave. So<br />\nwhen she was told that she had<br />\nto go, she feigned acquiensence,<br />\nand then lit the garbage with a<br />\nmatch. And Ann Baker died.<br />\nThe next day the News-Letter<br />\ncame out with a lead article on<br />\nAnn Baker's death accompanied<br />\nby an angry, vindictive editorial.<br />\nThe pieces combined to imply<br />\none simple statement: Hopkins<br />\nkilled Ann Baker.<br />\nI was stunned. The conclusion<br />\nwas specious. For this reason:<br />\nAnn Baker predetermined her<br />\nown death. Thirteen years<br />\nbefore, she had carefully begun<br /><br />\nto construct an existence which<br />\ncould never have tolerated<br />\nexposure to the external world.<br />\nHopkins' eviction did force the<br />\ncrisis, and so the suicide (her one<br />\nalternative for an absolute<br />\nrebellion against reality). But the<br />\ncrisis probably would have been<br />\nforced anyway, by some other<br />\nagency, because THE<br />\nBALTIMOREAN WAS FOR<br />\nSALE. It is a definite possibility<br />\nthat WHOEVER had bought that<br />\nbuilding might have evicted Ann<br />\nBaker. And so killed her?<br />\nOne can only guess at the<br />\nreasoning of the News-Letter<br />\nstaff. It seems legitimate to say,<br />\nhowever, that the Ann Baker<br />\neditorial was \u2022 just a natural<br />\nconsequence of the continuing<br />\nseries of articles and editorials<br />\nconcerning the Baltimorean.

At the service, Mao, who died last week at the<br />\nage<br />\nof 82, was the subject of numerous tributes and<br />\nexpressions<br />\nof admiration and thanks for the tremendous<br />\nrevolutionary<br />\nchange through which he helped guide the Chinese people<br />\nin<br />\nthe last sixty years.<br />\nA central feature of Mao's life was his<br />\nconstant,<br />\nunwavering dedication to serving his Chinese countryme<br />\nn.<br />\nTheoretician, statesman, military leader, and educator were<br />\nbut some of the forms this service took. Although the<br />\nhas been long, difficult and not without mistakes, road<br />\neven<br />\nWestern observers must admit that the quality of life in<br />\nChina<br />\nhas been dramatically upgraded under Mao's leadershi<br />\n.<br /><br />\nBut in the end, Mao wanted to be remembered primarily as<br />\na teacher. Perhaps more than any other modern figure, Mao<br />\nwas able to communicate a dynamic, integrated<br />\nunderstanding of how the world works and how people can<br />\nchange it. While most of his theories and accomplishments<br />\nrun counter to the American ethic, they are well worth<br />\nconsidering in light of the tremendous influence they have<br />\nexerted on people throughout the world. And perhaps more<br />\nthan anything else, Mao should be bailed for illustrating that<br />\na betterment of the human condition need not be an idle,<br />\nutopian dream, but, through a common, sustained effort, can<br />\nbecome gratifying reality.<br /><br />\nCaptain Bligh<br /><br />\nThe University:for whose end?<br />\nWe need a sense of morality<br />\nBy MARK HERTSGAARD<br />\n\"What is this university supposed to<br />\nbe?\"<br />\nAfter more than a week of<br />\n\"orientation\", the same conversations<br />\n(where you from, what's your major,<br />\nwhat are you taking, etc.), and official<br />\nwelcomes from university luminaries<br />\nof various intensities, that question, or<br />\nvariations of it, has probably been<br />\npondered by many a freshman.<br />\nAlthough perhaps to a lesser extent,<br />\nupperclassmen may be considering the<br />\nsame query as they come progressively<br />\ncloser to graduation. Seniors can<br />\nhardly avoid the matter since<br />\neveryone they talk to asks the<br />\ninevitable question regarding their<br />\nplans after leaving Hopkins. Of course,<br />\nthe answer depends largely on what a<br />\nsenior has already done at this<br />\nuniversity and how well it has met<br />\nhis/her needs.<br />\nAt the root of most of the<br />\nchallenges against the traditionalist<br />\nview of the university has been the<br />\ndisturbing realization that a college<br />\neducation no longer assures a<br />\ngood<br />\njob\" in today's society. In her book,<br />\nThe Case Against College, Caroline<br />\nBird argues that many high school<br />\ngraduates can fare better financially<br />\nby going to work and saving the<br />\nthousands of would-be tuition dollars.<br />\nIn the face of such criticism. Johns<br />\nHopkins President Steven Muller has<br />\ncalled for the goals of American<br />\nuniversities to be reoriented toward<br />\nhigher learning and away from mere<br />\nhigher skilling. While preparation for<br />\nfuture jobs would still remain a<br />\nfixture of the college years, the<br />\nprimary purpose of university<br />\ninstruction and study must be to<br />\nproduce graduates who are highly<br />\neducated.<br />\nOf course, the role of the university<br />\nis always partly determined by the<br />\nconstraints of the society in which it<br />\nexists. The purposes of universities in<br />\n1976 America differ markedly from<br />\nthose of colonial times when<br />\ninstitutions of higher education<br />\nproduced mainly clergy and teachers.<br />\nColleges and universities by and large<br />\nremained establishments reserved for<br />\nthe intellectually and socially elite<br />\nwell into the tweatieth century. But<br />\naround the time of World Vvar II, and<br />\ncorresponding to the ever increasing<br />\nneeds for educated, technical<br />\npersonnel to run the rapidly<br />\ndeveloping American economy, higher<br />\neducation began to be democratized.<br />\nThe numbers of college students and,<br />\nconsequently, also their diversity in<br />\nterms of race and class,nottceably<br />\nincreased. The university began to be<br />\nperceived as an institution that<br />\npumped out the graduates necessary<br />\nto keep America moving forward in<br />\nthe modern age.<br /><br />\nAs Alvin Toffler wrote in Future<br />\nShock, \"Mass education was the<br />\ningenious machine constructed by<br />\nindustrialism to produce the kind of<br />\nadults it needed to run industrial<br />\nsociety. . .Yet the whole idea of<br />\nassembling masses of students (raw<br />\nmaterial) to be processed by teachers<br />\n(workers) in a centrally located school<br />\n(factory) was a stroke of industrial<br />\ngenius.\" Although Toffler was writing<br />\nin regard to the time period of the<br />\nIndustrial Revolution, the parallels to<br />\ntoday are obvious. In fact, much of<br />\nthe student protest of the 1960's was<br />\ndirected against the regimentation,<br />\nalienation and authoritarianism of<br />\nhigher education and the society<br />\nwhich it reflected.<br />\nNow, as we move through the<br />\n1970's, it is more common for<br />\nstudents to question the purposes of<br />\nhigher education in more<br />\nself-centered, career oriented terms.<br />\nWill it give me a better job? Is it worth<br />\nall that money?<br />\nIt is exceedingly important for us<br />\nto remember that views on the<br />\npurpose and the role of the university<br />\ngreatly depend on one's perspective<br />\non and relationship to it. Rest assured<br />\nthat a rising student politico's and a<br />\npre-med's views differ substantially<br />\nand that their difference is small when<br />\ncompared to that between a staff<br />\ncustodian and a university trustee.<br />\nConsider als9 the contrast between<br />\nhow major corporations and<br />\ncommunity residents conceive of<br />\nuniversities and their members.<br />\nIn spite of these individual<br />\ndifferences, the world of academia is<br />\nstill permeated by the comfortable.<br />\nconventional view of the role of the<br />\nuniversity. The university is seen as a<br />\ncenter of culture, free thinking and<br />\nindependent, oective research and<br />\ninstruction. The uni\u2022<br />\n:s<br />\nsometimes considered to<br />\n\u201e sort of<br />\nenlightened, benevolent servant who<br />\nearns his keep in society by helping us<br />\nbetter to understand and confront the<br />\nworld and by tackling the tough<br />\nproblems that impede human<br />\nprogress.<br />\nIn judging the aptness of this<br />\ndescription, two suggestions may<br />\nprove helpful. First, in making any<br />\nsocial judgment, perhaps the most<br />\nuseful questions to ask are: who is<br />\nhurt, who is helped, how, and why?<br />\nSecond, the judgments again depend<br />\nlargely on whose perspective (e.g.,<br />\nstudent, faculty or society) is<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nFor the well-directed, career<br />\noriented undergrad, Johns Hopkins<br />\nprovides one of the finest educations<br />\nin the country; that is, the JHU<br />\neducation will help its recipient along<br />\nthe road to grad school, a respectable,<br />\nand perhaps even interesting, job, and<br />\nultimately to American success. But<br />\nbefore lauding Hopkins on this<br />\naccomplishment, we must consider<br />\nthe nature of this success. In this<br />\ncontext, success can be seen as<br />\nimplying the wealth, prestige and<br />\nsecurity that usually accompany<br />\nupper middle class existence. But<br />\nwhat about the notion of service to<br />\nsociety? Is an M.D. degree to be<br />\nviewed as an unofficial license to print<br />\nmoney or rather as an opportunity to<br />\nserve society in a special capacity?<br />\nWhile students participate almost<br />\nexclusively in the second of the<br />\nuniversity's major functions, as the<br />\nrecipients of teaching, professors<br />\nengage in both teaching and research.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the professors most<br />\nesteemed by the university are those<br />\nwho bring fame and prestige (and,<br />\ntherefore, plenty of research funds) to<br />\nHopkins; i.e., the well renowned<br />\nresearch scholars. Some of these men<br />\nand women are also fine, dedicated<br />\neducators, a happy combination for<br />\nall concerned. Some are not. But for<br />\nthose faculty members who do not<br />\nexcel in the \"publish of perish\" game,<br />\nreceiving tenure is almost impossible if<br />\nhe/she is judged by colleagues in the<br />\nacademic world not to be in the top<br />\ntwenty percent in his/her field. This<br />\npriority of research over teaching<br />\nclearly has negative ramifications on<br />\nthe quality of instruction at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nBut we must probe beyond these<br />\nramifications to try to determine what<br />\nthis priority says about the nature of<br />\nJohns Hopkins and other universities.<br />\nIt indicates that the primary allegiance<br />\nof the university and many of its<br />\nfaculty must be toward the kind of<br />\nresearch that will attract substantial<br />\ngrant monies. A research project or an<br />\ninnovative program cannot be run if<br />\nno funds are available. And what kind<br />\nof research fits this definition? Often,<br />\nand obviously, it must be the kind<br />\nthat will serve those wealthy and<br />\npowerful interests (big corporations,<br />\nthe government, etc.) who can afford<br />\nto sponsor it. This should not be seen<br />\nas surprising. How reasonable is it to<br />\nexpect that profit-conscious<br />\norganizations will squander money on<br />\nresearch that is of little or no use to<br />\nthem?<br />\nThese practices and relationships<br />\nhave very definite implications on<br />\nhow and who the university serves in<br />\nits cotnmunity and society. To<br />\ncontinue to exist, a primary concern<br />\nof Johns Hopkins and other<br />\nuniversities must be to stay in the<br />\ngood graces of the rich and powerful.<br />\nThe conducting of research that serves<br />\nthose interests is a major, but not the<br />\nonly, tool at the disposal of a<br />\nuniversity. These priorities, which<br />\ndictate that much of the research in<br />\nAmerican universities be oriented<br />\ntoward such areas as weapons<br />\ndevelopment rather than projects that<br />\nwill help those most in need, are<br />\nsimilar to those that cause the<br />\ngovernment to spend a<br />\ndisproportionate amount of national<br />\ndefense at the expense of rural health<br />\nservices. The challenging by<br />\nuniversities of this \"them that has.<br />\ngits\" status quo is not encouraged.<br />\nThis is not meant to imply that a<br />\nuniversity performs no useful<br />\nfunctions. Nor should one get the<br />\nimpression that university, corporate<br />\nand governmental officials spend all<br />\ntheir waking hours plotting to exploit<br />\nthe poor. Such \u2018Tiotild be an<br />\ninsensitive, shallow and naive<br />\njudgement. Qn the contrary, there are<br />\nmany instances when useful services<br />\nhave been performed by people within<br />\nthe university. I3ut in aggregate, no<br /><br />\nmistaken judgement can be made. A<br />\nuniversity cannot serve two masters<br />\nand, when forced to choose, cannot<br />\nafford to bite the hand that feeds it.<br />\nSome may counter this line of<br />\nreasoning with the argument (often<br />\nheard during last year's Iranian<br />\ndemonstrations) that a university<br />\nmust play this unfortunate game if it<br />\nis to remain solvent. That's the way<br />\nthe system is, the way the world<br />\noperates. If the university is to exist<br />\nand hope to serve society, it must<br />\nsometimes accept money for some<br />\nresearch activities that are ethically<br />\nquestionable. Such people sometimes<br />\neven admit that this practice cheapens<br />\nthe integrity of the university, but<br />\nwould consider it to be a necessary<br />\nevil that is traded off against the good<br />\nthat the urliversity can do. This<br />\ncounter-argument is correct in one<br />\nvery important point\u2014yes, the system,<br />\nthe constraints of modern, Western<br />\nsociety, does demand that universities<br />\nperform this way. However, this<br />\nargument errs by limply accepting<br />\nthese practices as regrettable<br />\nnecessities rather than questioning the<br />\nmorality and legitimacy of the system<br />\nthat produces them.<br /><br />\nse<br />\nat<br />\nof<br />\n;s.<br />\nce<br />\nLts<br />\nof<br />\nal<br />\nin<br />\nif<br /><br />\nid<br /><br />\nn,<br /><br />\nid<br />\ns,<br />\n.d<br />\n;r1<br />\n:o<br /><br />\nIs<br /><br />\nby Sky King<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nGregory the Airplane (You were expecting \"Songbird\".<br />\nperlwps?) flew again this weekend.

The<br />\nopponent maintained excellent<br />\nball control throughout the<br />\ngame, thereby calling the Jay's<br />\ndefense to meet the challenge.<br />\nIn the first half a George<br />\nWashington break away was<br />\nhalted by the quick hands of a<br />\n.11-1U fullback who pulled down<br />\nthe potential scorer. When the<br />\noPponent failed on the penalty<br />\noPportunity the Blue Jays were<br />\nout of trouble. Later in the<br />\nsecond half it was goalie Ken<br />\nSuesse who stopped a GW threat<br />\nby just tipping away another<br />\nbeautifully placed direct kick.<br />\nWith the big opening game<br />\nagainst Haverford only a few<br />\ndays away, Coach Bob Oliver<br />\nthought it wise to rest his starting<br />\noffensive line trio of Greg<br />\nC unningham, Larry<br />\nMcGowan,<br /><br />\nand Hyam Levin. Without this<br />\nextra scoring punch in the lineup<br />\nit was difficult for the JHUers to<br />\ngenerate any offensive threats,<br />\nthough they did muster a few.<br />\nAbout a quarter of the way<br />\ninto the second half the Blue<br />\nJays were able to put pressure on<br />\nthe George Washington goal<br />\ntender. Some unnecessary<br />\ndramatics on the part of the GW<br />\ngoalie allowed the ball to squirt<br />\nloose in front of the net and if it<br />\nhadn't been for the experienced<br />\nfeet of the GW defenders, the<br />\nJays would have found<br />\nthemselves right back in the<br />\nballgame.<br />\nOn another occasion lineman<br />\nJoe Siemek was able to gain<br />\ncontrol of the loose ball and send<br />\na looping shot right on net. The<br />\nGW goalie was able to recover<br />\njust in time in order to bat away<br />\nthe potential goal.<br />\nJHU's last scoring opportunity<br />\ncame with only seconds left in<br />\nthe game. Gary Ignatowski was<br />\nfed a beautiful slide pass that left<br />\nhim ten yards out, one on one<br />\nagainst the goalie. But again the<br />\nJays were turned away by a<br />\npretty save.<br />\nCoach Oliver was pleased with<br />\nthis final game as he was with the<br />\nentire soccer preseason.<br />\nAccording to him his entire<br />\nsubstitution bench showed poise<br />\nIFV:a<br /><br />\ng<br />\noriginal study materials<br />\nsmall groups \u2022 tape center<br />\n37 years of success<br />\nCALL<br />\n(202)<br />\n244-3010 M<br />\nEDUCATIONAL CENTER<br />\n4201 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.<br />\nWashington, D.C. 20008<br /><br />\n3tA3:513:<br />\n1 AIZA=SI<br /><br />\n-c<br /><br />\nCO<br /><br />\nCr)<br /><br />\nAlthough it may seem to be<br />\nthe wrong season of the year,<br />\nthere will be plenty of lacrosse<br />\nexcitement on Homewood Field<br />\ntomorrow night.<br />\nThe action will be provided by<br />\nthe Fourth Annual Superstar<br />\nLacrosse Game sponsored by the<br />\nLacrosse Foundation, Inc. and<br />\nwill begin at 8:30.<br />\nPitting last year's College<br />\nAll -Stars against their<br />\ncounterparts from the Clubs, the<br />\ncontest will be a good<br />\nintroduction to the sport for<br />\nthose newcomers to Baltimore<br />\nand/or lacrosse and an excellent<br />\nopportunity to see many of last<br />\nyear's star players once again.<br /><br />\n3105 St. Paul St.<br /><br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br />\nThe Sunday Experience<br /><br />\n467-7882<br /><br />\nA Presentation By<br />\nDr. JOHN WALTON<br /><br />\nNe$43:533:S11:5SMITZ131:33:53=3*/<br />\n1<br />\nAtill=fa,Z37:53StfSIMEJ<br /><br />\nNAT'L MEDICAL BDS.<br />\nFLEX \u2022 ECFMG \u2022 DAT<br /><br />\nMCA<br />\nT<br />\nwith confidenc<br /><br />\nFULL LINE RECORD STORE<br />\n........with a complete<br />\nstock of classical, rock,imports.<br />\npopular&amp;<br />\n\u2014jazz!!!!<br /><br />\n\u20144<br />\nf<br />\nc<br />\n:<br /><br />\nACADEMIC<br />\nRESEARCH<br />\nPAPERS<br /><br />\n\"\"011111/'<br /><br />\n03<br /><br />\nDISCOUNT I<br />\nPRICES<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHOUSANDS ON FILE<br /><br />\nEXTRA DISCOUNT<br />\noff on any, TWQ,<br />\nIp's or tapes<br />\nI<br />\nWith this ad- - -<br /><br />\n\u2022v.<br />\n\u2022-..<br /><br />\nON AD PER CUSTOMER<br /><br />\nSend $1.00 for your up-to-date,<br />\n192-page, mail order catalog.<br /><br />\nLEVERING HALL<br /><br />\nKUNDALINI YOGA<br />\nAND<br />\nMEDITATION<br />\nRelax your body<br />\nQuiet your mind<br />\nRefresh your spirit<br /><br />\nAt the Kundalini Yoga Center,<br />\n2322 N.
