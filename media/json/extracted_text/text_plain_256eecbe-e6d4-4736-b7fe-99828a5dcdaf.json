They have done everything in their power to make the<br />\naffairs attractive, limiting attendance to those connected with<br />\nthe University, and setting the price of tickets at the nominal<br />\nfigure of one dollar.<br />\nThe easiest part remains for the students.

It is our intention, however, not to discuss the shortcomings of those who<br />\nwere absent on that particular day; but rather to consider very<br />\nbriefly the whole question of Assemblies.<br />\nThe suggestion has been advanced that attendance at Assemblies be made purely voluntary for the lower classes, as well<br />\nas for juniors and seniors. But the advocates of such a plan<br />\nseem to be making a mountain out of the proverbial mole hill.<br />\nExcePt in rare instances, it does not seem possible that the<br />\nrequirement to be in the C. E. Hall fifty minutes out of the<br />\nweek can weigh heavily upon any but those supporters of the<br />\ntheory of the inalienable right of the'college man to do as little<br />\nas possible who would spend two hours getting out of required<br />\nwork which would require ten minutes. \u2022<br />\nOn the other hand, the advantage of this fifty minutes may<br />\nbe very great. It is the one opportunity for the undergraduate<br />\nbody as anything approaching a unit. It is the logical place<br />\nfor undergraduate events of general interest and for announcements of the University authorities.<br />\nAs for the addresses which usually take up most of the<br />\ntime we cheerfully admit that they are sometimes tiresome, but<br />\nnevertheless we contend that they are a good thing. As a means<br />\nof keeping the student in touch with subjects beyond his small<br />\nlist of required courses they are valuable. The practical engineer can desert his machinery, doff his overalls and attend a<br />\nlecture on the beauty of English verse; while the pallid student<br />\nof the classics will at some other time have the opportunity of<br />\nhaving Gas Engineering explained in terms that he stands<br />\nsome chance of grasping. Such a diversity of topics is broad<br />\n.ening, especially when they lie outside the sphere of some of<br />\nthe hearers.

They have done everything in their power to make the<br />\naffairs attractive, limiting attendance to those connected with<br />\nthe University, and setting the price of tickets at the nominal<br />\nfigure of one dollar.<br />\nThe easiest part remains for the students. In order to<br />\nsupport the project, and out of courtesy to the two teams that<br />\nare the high lights of the lacrosse schedule, every one who is<br />\npossibly able should make every effort to attend.<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\n%<br /><br />\n%<br /><br />\nTroubled face of heaven;<br />\nWarms a bit, with cotton sky.<br />\nChildren laugh while grown-ups curse;<br />\nSewers gush, streets a-mush.

MoNEAL, '27<br /><br />\nPleasant breezes and warm sunlight succeeded last Thursday<br />\nin lulling the fears which the Dean's letter to Assembly cutters<br />\nhad inspired in the minds of sophomores and freshmen; and<br />\nattendance at the weekly gathering again fell to a low ebb.<br />\nThose who felt the lure of the great open spaces missed a very<br />\nexcellent contest for the Adams trophy, the winner of which. the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER wishes to heartily congratulate. It is our intention, however, not to discuss the shortcomings of those who<br />\nwere absent on that particular day; but rather to consider very<br />\nbriefly the whole question of Assemblies.<br />\nThe suggestion has been advanced that attendance at Assemblies be made purely voluntary for the lower classes, as well<br />\nas for juniors and seniors. But the advocates of such a plan<br />\nseem to be making a mountain out of the proverbial mole hill.<br />\nExcePt in rare instances, it does not seem possible that the<br />\nrequirement to be in the C. E. Hall fifty minutes out of the<br />\nweek can weigh heavily upon any but those supporters of the<br />\ntheory of the inalienable right of the'college man to do as little<br />\nas possible who would spend two hours getting out of required<br />\nwork which would require ten minutes. \u2022<br />\nOn the other hand, the advantage of this fifty minutes may<br />\nbe very great. It is the one opportunity for the undergraduate<br />\nbody as anything approaching a unit. It is the logical place<br />\nfor undergraduate events of general interest and for announcements of the University authorities.<br />\nAs for the addresses which usually take up most of the<br />\ntime we cheerfully admit that they are sometimes tiresome, but<br />\nnevertheless we contend that they are a good thing. As a means<br />\nof keeping the student in touch with subjects beyond his small<br />\nlist of required courses they are valuable. The practical engineer can desert his machinery, doff his overalls and attend a<br />\nlecture on the beauty of English verse; while the pallid student<br />\nof the classics will at some other time have the opportunity of<br />\nhaving Gas Engineering explained in terms that he stands<br />\nsome chance of grasping. Such a diversity of topics is broad<br />\n.ening, especially when they lie outside the sphere of some of<br />\nthe hearers. And in any particular instance when the subject<br />\nfails to awaken any intellectual response in a few indivduals,<br />\nit is always possible to slumber in an attitude of respectful<br />\n_attention..<br />\nThus, whatever may be the weather conditions of the few<br />\nremaining Thursdays, the NEWS-LETTER hopes for a better response to the regulation on Assembly attendance.<br /><br />\nWill Be %<br />\n%<br />\n% .
