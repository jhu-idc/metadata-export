Exact figures<br />\nfrom the preliminary survey will<br />\nbe published in a chart in next<br />\nFriday's issue along with a comparative survey of non-University<br />\nbookstores.<br />\nA comparative survey of college bookstores in the Baltimore<br />\narea conducted by the News-Letter reveals that textbook prices at<br />\nthe Follett's Book Center are<br />\ncomparable to those charged at<br />\nother college bookstores,<br />\nalthough its prices for non-text<br />\nitems are significantly higher<br />\nthan the mean.<br />\nThe News-Letter's findings<br />\ncorroborate the conclusion reached by the Homewood Advisory<br />\nCouncil's ad hoc committee\u2014that<br />\nFollett's textbook prices are in<br />\nline with those charged by most<br />\nother college bookstores.

All five<br />\nbookstores adhere to a policy of<br />\ncharging the \"publishers' suggested retail price.\"<br />\nThe findings point, however,<br />\nto a larger problem--the con-competitive nature of the textbook industry, which may be a<br />\ncontributing factor to the relatively high price of college texts.<br />\nJack Sanders, manager of<br />\nFollett's Hopkins branch, suggested that \"a possible price lea-<br />\n<br />\ndership scheme may exist in the<br />\ntextbook industry.\" Though he<br />\nruled out the possibility of collusion on the part of publishing<br />\nfirms, he mused, \"Isn't it strange<br />\nthat all Calculus books sell at<br />\n$15.95, regardless of who the<br />\nauthor is?\"<br />\n\"You can't tell me that one<br />\ncompany [acting in a competitive<br />\nmanner] can't put one out for<br />\n$12.95,\" he continued. \"Doesn't<br />\nit seem strange that out of 56<br />\npublishers, 54 supply a 21S percent discount rate to retail stores?\"<br />\nAn examination of invoices for<br />\ntextbooks at Hopkins, Towson<br />\nState and Loyola College reveals<br />\nthat the bookstores of all three<br />\nschools are granted 20 percent<br />\ndiscount rate.

Its impact is mainly theatrical\u2014it<br />\nattempts to discourage cheating not by actually ferreting out<br />\nany substantial amount of miscreants, but by demonstrating<br />\nfor all the student body to see the terrible punishment<br />\nreserved for offenders.<br />\nThus, criticism that not enough convictions have been<br />\narrived at or that students shirk their responsibility to uphold<br />\nthe Honor code does not show any deficiency on the part of<br />\nthe Honor system. It does show that faculty and students<br />\nhave not lived up to the spirit of the Honor code, not that<br />\nthe Commission or the system has failed. Though we agree<br />\nwith Savitz and Connor that students and faculty must better<br />\nuphold the system, we do not feel that their failure to do so<br />\nto date justifies compromising the Honor system. Students<br />\nand faculty must be made to bear the burden of<br />\nresponsibility in upholding the Honor code.

I will<br />\nattempt to address the problems of<br />\nthe recent article and then offer a<br />\nfew observations on the place of<br />\nthe Viet Nam in the geo-political<br />\nconfiguration of Southeast Asia.<br />\nThe first statement which draws<br />\none's attention entails the presumptiveness of the author in the following, \"We went to the Embassy<br />\nnot only to warn the U.S. government that the American people<br />\nwill not stand for renewed and<br />\nheightened was, but also to awaken<br />\nother Americans to the situation in<br />\nIndo-China, and to expose Ford's<br />\nlies to the people in the United<br />\nStates.\" I submit that the \"we\",<br />\nthose representatives of the \"IndoChina Peace Campaign,\" \"The<br />\nAssembly to Save the Peace Agreements\" and other such nebulous<br />\ngorups are not in fact representatives of the American people or of<br />\ntheir \"will,\" as the author of the<br />\narticle puts it later. It is doubtful<br />\nthat most Americans have ever<br />\nheard of these groups save a<br />\nminority of the radical intellectual<br />\nelite whose primary purpose in<br />\nsuch groups appears to be a vindication of their own ideas about<br />\nwho should rule Indo-China. The<br />\nauthor seems to assume that some<br />\nsort of mandate on this particular<br />\nforeign policy issue resides with<br />\nthese groups. This the author has<br />\nfailed to show deomonstrably. In<br />\nfact the American people on the<br />\n<br />\nwhole seem to be extremely apatheitc to the Indo-China comflict,<br />\nas evidenced by the pitiful furnout<br />\nat recent protests both for and<br />\nagainst aid to South Viet Nam. In<br />\nthe same statement one hears of<br />\nboth \"the American people\" and<br />\n\"Other Americans.\" I Was hoping<br />\nthe author would explain the distinction between the two. She does<br />\nnot. In the third part of the statement one is informed of Mr. Ford's<br />\n\"lies to the American people.\"<br />\nThis is really rank with self righteosness. From what pedestal does<br />\nthe author presume to make such<br />\nan indictment, again with no_demonstratable evidence. Surely those<br />\nmembers of the American news<br />\nmedia who exposed the Watergate<br />\nmess would direct the same skill at,<br />\nincovering the \"lies\" of the present<br />\nAmerican president. Or perhaps<br />\nthe author presumes that all her<br />\nreaders have been imbibed so with<br />\nthe post-Watergate mentality that<br />\nit follows ipso facto that all politicians are \"liars.\" I don't think<br />\nmost readers hold this to be axiomatic and hence some explanation of<br />\nsuch a statement was necessary but<br />\nnot forthcoming.<br />\nThe article continues, \"As long<br />\nas our government officials are in<br />\nViet Nam making war, we feel we<br />\nhave the right to follow them with<br />\nprotest and expose.\" As to the first<br />\npoint the author of the article<br />\nshould be reminded that upwards<br />\nof 250.000 North Vietnamese regular army soldiers with millions in<br />\nSoviet and Chinese logistical support are not in South Viet Nam on<br />\na boy scout campout.

In seeking to uncover the roots of any friction between Dr. Wickwire and Dr. Bento<br />\nthe article overemphasized the<br />\nrole played by Dr. Wickwire in the<br />\n\"trial\" of those who disrupted an<br />\nAcademic Council meeting back in<br />\n1971.

I believe<br />\nthat the editors have a responsibility to report accurately what is<br />\nhappening on campus. However in<br />\nhis two articles on the athletic financial aid situation, Mr. Duvoisin<br />\nhas overstepped his obligations to<br />\nthe point of deceiving his audience<br />\nabout what is really the truth. In<br />\naddition, he has blown up the<br />\nevent of several people quitting the<br />\nswim team into some sort of<br />\nWatergate type scandal which<br />\ndoesn't even exist. Mr. Duvoisin's<br />\nwriting is a superb example of<br />\nMcCarthy style rhetoric designed<br />\nto expose through half truths and<br />\nundocumented evidence grave<br />\n\"misconduct\" by Coach Comfort,<br />\nand Wayne Hood at the Financial<br />\nAid Office. Only this time it is<br />\nDuvoisin instead of McCarthy who<br />\nholds the imaginary list of names<br />\nand allegations right there in his<br />\npocket.<br />\nIn my opinion, sending<br />\nrecommendations to the Admissions Office is a perfectly legitimate practice and not misconduct<br />\nas Mr. Duvoisin charges. I'm sure<br />\nthat everyone in this school has<br />\nhad letters of recommendation<br />\nwritten on their behalf. Should<br />\nathletes be discouraged from emphasizing their athletic ability during the admissions procedure while<br />\nat the same time others are encouraged to emphasize their strong<br />\npoints such as music, debating, or<br />\nacting? I'm sure that Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin's journalistic ability was a<br />\npositive factor in his acceptance<br />\nhere at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIn respect to Duvoisin's allegations about a tie between Coach<br />\nComfort and the Financial Aid office, he offers no proof at all. He<br />\nrelies on anonymous hearsay and<br />\ninformation released to the News-<br />\n<br />\nLetter that \"suggests\" that Coach<br />\nComfort has had' more communication with Financial Aid than he<br />\nadmits. Must we be obliged to take<br />\nhis work on this very important<br />\nissue?<br />\nMr. Duvoisin has invented this<br />\nmisconduct to serve his own purposes, and has based his destructive<br />\nallegations on hearsay, half truths<br />\nand lies. I \"suggest\" that one could<br />\nfind more misconduct among the<br />\nNews-Letter editors if one took the<br />\ntime to look. I know that in the<br />\nfuture I will hesitate to take for<br />\ngranted what Mr. Duvoisin says in<br />\nhis articles, and I will always wonder whether he is telling the truth,<br />\nor trying to pull the wool over my<br />\neyes.<br />\nPeter J.

In this article<br />\nthe Thieu government is pictured<br />\nas repressive and arbitrary, but certainly the Northern government<br />\npossesses these qualities of totalitarianism and much more.

If she would simply state her ideological preference<br />\nclearly for us to read, instead of<br />\nhiding it with verbiage concerning<br />\nan unAmerican Saigon government, I could bear the publication<br />\nof such propaganda in the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter with greater ease.<br />\n<br />\npoint is interesting.

But this is of<br />\npassing interest and obscures one<br />\nof the key ideas which pervades a<br />\ngreat deal of the article. Though<br />\nthe distinction is often blurred in<br />\nthe American press, there is a difference between those who wish<br />\nfor the demise of Mr. Thieu and<br />\nthose who wish for the extension<br />\nof North Vietnamese political<br />\nhegemony over the whole of IndoChina. The with drawl of American<br />\naid whether immediate or slow<br />\nwould bring down more than just<br />\nthe Thieu regime and the responsible members of the South<br />\nVietnamese opposition realize this.<br />\nThose members of the Army,<br />\nwhich forms a sizable proportion<br />\nof the population, the great numbers of deserters from the North<br />\nVietnamese Army, those hundreds<br />\nof thousands of Catholics who fled<br />\nNorth Viet Nam during the partition, the refugees from rocket<br />\nattacks on civiliam population centers of no military value, and the<br />\nmembers of the South Vietnamese<br />\n,administrative apparatus down to<br />\nthe hamlet chiefs and teachers, are<br />\nnot resisting the North Vietnamese<br />\narmy out of any particular continued American aid that they can resist.<br />\nSurely the Thieu regime is corrupt, there is plenty of evidence<br />\nthat the North Vietnamese government is also corrupt and it is a fact<br />\nthat there is a sizable black market<br />\nin North Viet Nam.

The NLF or<br />\nViet Cong, as distinct from the<br />\nNorth Vietnamese Army, engages<br />\nin a brutal terrorist campaign<br />\nwhich reached its height in the<br />\nTET offensive of 1968. The answer<br />\nto this kind of activity is exercised<br />\nin Northern Ireland as well as in<br />\nSouth Vietnam. There it is called<br />\ninternment. In North Viet Nam<br />\nthere are also political prisoners,<br />\nwho are not terrorists, and no political opposition is allowed.<br />\nThe article in question continues<br />\nwith a discussion of the Paris Peace<br />\nAccords but fails to present a true<br />\npicture of what those Accords en<br />\ntailed.

Viet Nam affects the<br />\nworld balance of power in the<br />\nsame way that the Middle ,East<br />\ndoes, albeit the stakes in the latter<br />\nare considerable higher. Because of<br />\nthis influence the U.S. has a legitimate interest in the eventual configuration of power in Indo-China,<br />\nand the Soviet Union and China<br />\nalso do.

Jim Finnerty then<br />\nwent on to win the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 22.8.<br />\nThe next race, the 200-yard individual medley, proved to be<br />\none of the brightest spots of the<br />\nmeet for Hopkins.

Eric<br />\nEngelmann had a comfortable<br />\nlead going into the last-lap when<br />\nhe suffered a severe cramp in his<br />\nleft side which caused him to<br />\nstop swimming.

Since<br />\nhis meets at North Carolina and<br />\nEast Carolina, he has cut his<br />\ntimes from 2:38 and 2:31 to a<br />\ncommendable 2:24.9 against<br />\nMaryland.

The first<br />\nrequirement is an adequate supply of talented, experienced athletes, and the second is the<br />\ncoach, who provides leadership<br />\nand guidance for the team. For<br />\nthe Hopkins wrestling team, this<br />\nman is Harry Gotwals.<br />\nCoach Gotwals, 27 years of<br />\nage, is a native of Chambersburg,<br />\nPennsylvania. He attended Chambersburg High School taking a<br />\ncollege preparatory curriculum.,<br />\none that would eventually bring<br />\nhim to Johns Hopkins as an<br />\nundergraduate.<br />\nOddly enough, Gotwals did<br />\nnot begin his athletic career as a<br />\nwrestler, but as a basketball player. He played basketball in ninth<br />\nand tenth grades but found his<br />\nimportance declining in his<br />\ncoach's eyes and began participating in intermural wrestling.<br />\nWhen he was a junior, Chambersburg introduced wrestling at the<br />\nvarsity level and Gotwals went<br />\nout for the team. He was a starter<br />\nby mid-season wrestling at 127.<br />\nAs a senior, he was co-captain of<br />\nthe squad picking up his share of<br />\nwins and losses including a thirteen second pin.<br />\nGotwals came to Hopkins in<br />\n1965 as a student and also participated in the wrestling program<br />\ncompiling a fair record in his four'<br />\nyear career. His personal realationships with other members of<br />\nthe team played a factor in his<br />\ndesire to coach. Upon graduation, Gotwals obtained a job<br />\nteaching at Boy's Latin in<br />\nBaltimore where he taught and<br />\ncoached wrestling for two years.<br />\nFour years ago, he was offered<br />\nan opportunity by Johns<br />\n<br />\nHopkins to work for the<br />\nUniversity raising funds. When he<br />\nreturned to Homewood, he expressed an interest in assistant<br />\ncoaching job in wrestling.<br />\nHopkins couldn't pay him but he<br />\ndecided to work out with the<br />\nteam anyway. One week later,<br />\nthe head coach quit and Gotwals<br />\ngot the top job.<br />\nIn his four seasons as a coach,<br />\nHopkins has had three winning<br />\nseasons. But he doesn't take<br />\nmuch credit for his team's performances. \"I just try to catch mistakes, picking up the good things<br />\nathletes do and try to develop<br />\nthem,\" commented Gotwals.<br />\n\"One reason we have been as fortunate in winning and losing is<br />\nthe role that trainer Leroy<br />\nBrandimore has played.

He enjoys the personal<br />\nrelationships and rewards of<br />\ncoaching and teaching. He is also<br />\nproud of those who have shown<br />\nleadership on the team and have<br />\nsucceeded scholastically. Gotwals<br />\nattributes this to the good perspective the coaches have for<br />\nplacing academics first and putting the role of athletics into one<br />\nof personal enrichment for the<br />\nathletes. In this way, a true<br />\nscholar-athlete tradition exists at<br />\nHopkins. \"No one comes here<br />\njust to wrestle ,\" said Gotwals.<br />\n<br />\non Wednesday, February 26 at 7<br />\npm.

Gradually his senses cleared, and he<br />\nlooked around at the dense green foliage.<br />\nFrom far away came the cry of an ape<br />\nswinging through the trees. Slowly rising<br />\nto his feet, with one hand -on his aching<br />\nhead, he stumbled for a few steps before<br />\ncollapsing. Once again he climbed, to his<br />\nfeet, leaning on a nearby banana tree for<br />\nsupport. Bill .felt very weak. The heat of<br />\nthe tropical sun was almost intolerable.<br />\nSomehow he found the strength to walk<br />\nand began to wander through the jungle,<br />\nwith the hope of reaching civilization.<br />\nOccasionally, as Bill bungled along,<br />\nhe was approached by various creatures<br />\nof the jungle, bumming cigarettes and<br />\nsmall change. He was all the more grateful<br />\nthen, when at long last, tired and hungry,<br />\nhe stumbled upon a clearing in which<br />\nstood a large brick building bearing the<br />\nwords<br />\nLEXINGTON MARKET<br />\nHe groped his way to the front entrance. There was an old drunk with a hat<br />\nsitting outside the door, holding a tin cup<br />\n*and singing, 'Kung Fu Fighting'. \"Just<br />\nsome local talent,\" thought Bill to himself<br />\nas. he pulled open the door. The sight that<br />\ngreeted Bill inside was enough to make<br />\nhim think that he was in Paradise. He had<br />\nnever seen so much food in his life. Here<br />\nwere cheeses of all descriptions, and over<br />\nhere, beef and ham. Bill walked up and<br />\ndown, wide-eyed.

Trying to control his<br />\nexcitement, Bill stopped to look at a chicken, eyeing breasts and thighs hungrily.<br />\nHe bought a piece of chicken, and having<br />\nno money with him, paid for it with his<br />\nshirt. He asked the girl behind the counter if there were any tables nearby where<br />\nhe could eat. She seemed a bit nervous<br />\nabout speaking, he thought, and with<br />\ngood reason, for she had hardly said four<br />\nwords when a loud voice startled them.

The girl tried to protest,<br />\nbut was quickly silenced. Bill walked<br />\naway nervously.<br />\nHe soon found an area with tables and<br />\nchairs, but upon drawing closer, he<br />\nnoticed a sign which said, \"Kitchen Customers Only,\" and so he continued<br />\nlooking.<br />\nAfter a time, he became aware of a<br />\nfishy smell.

Today<br />\nthere are composer/performers whose<br />\nmusic is improvisatory in nature, and who<br />\nmust Ile recorded in order that their<br />\nmusic does not die. And there is also a<br />\nlarge group of composers whose work is<br />\nso complex that it is seldom performed,<br />\nand without the recorded media they<br />\nwould also remain virtually unknown.<br />\nTherefore, the key to their survival is the<br />\nrecord industry.<br />\nHowever, when dealing with avantgarde) music (the generic term for many<br />\nof thse musicians), the record industry is<br />\ncold and heartless. To them, the low sales<br />\nlevels of this \"new music\" constitues a<br />\nsacrilege of their most sacred priciples,<br />\nthe almighty profit dollar.<br />\nThe consequences are devastating to<br />\nthe new music and musicians. Many, in<br />\norder to get recorded, must sacrifice their<br />\nstandards and adapt their music to the<br />\nsales oriented commerical format that<br />\nsome studio A&R man gives them. Often<br />\nthey have little or no say in what (if anything) goes into \"their\" record, or how it<br />\nis packaged, publicised, or marketed.<br />\nSome examples include Miles Davis,<br />\nwho (according to Leonard Feather in the<br />\nFebruary 8 issue of Bilboard) was told in<br />\nthe late\u2022sixties to do something about his<br />\n<br />\nthe Orchestra featuring Cecil Taylor,<br />\nPharoah Sanders, Larry Coryell, and, the<br />\nthen unknown Gato Barbieri.<br />\nSince then they have released Compositions by Don Cherry, Rosewell Rudd,<br />\nand Carla Bley. Carla Bley's work was an<br />\nopera of sorts called Escalator Over the<br />\nHill, and it is probably the underground<br />\nsleeper of the decade. Her work is a combination jazz-rock-electronic music opera<br />\nwhich combine such talents as Gato<br />\nBarbier i, Don Cherry, Viva, Linda Ronstadt, and the combination of Jack Bruce<br />\nand John McLaughlin.<br />\nIn 1972, JCOA founded the New<br />\nMusic Distribution Service, in order to<br />\ndistribute the recorded, comissioned<br />\nworks of JCOA composers; to distribute<br />\nthe records of other independent new<br />\nmusic labels; and to support an alternate<br />\nsystem of recording and distribution for<br />\nnon-commercial music.<br />\nOf their three objectives, the last is<br />\nprobably the most important. Most major<br />\nlabels (like Columbia, for example) and<br />\ntheir affiliates (e.g., Bamaby, Bell, Epic,<br />\nOdyssey, Windfall, and brand-new Artista), are run in order the make profits.<br />\nThe product is generally closely<br />\ncontrolled by the producer, who is controlled by the corporation, which is directed by when they feel their sales should<br />\nbe, and in which markets. Many labels refuse to handle Jazz or New music on the<br />\ngrounds that it does not sell enough to<br />\nwarrant the investment. In the event that<br />\nthey do handle jazz artists, the artist is<br />\nrestricted by the producer in what gets to<br />\nbecome the product, and how is to be<br />\npackaged.<br />\nAs for the payment, it is often the case<br />\n<br />\nlagging sales, or find another label\u2014i.e.<br />\n\"sell out or else.\" Saxophonist Ornette<br />\nColeman, despite the fact that he is acclaimed as the most major innovator on,<br />\nsaxophone since Charlie Parker, has been<br />\nat various times with 7 different record<br />\ncompanies, one of which even told him<br />\nthat he owed them money. And Cecil<br />\nTaylor has had albums take as long at 13<br />\nyears to be released.<br />\nWhile some artists have sold out, and<br />\nsome have gone unrecorded, others have<br />\nfound a solution in the Jazz Composers<br />\nOrchestra Association and its New Music<br />\nDistribution Serivce(JCOA/NMDS).<br />\nThe idea for JCOA blossomed out of<br />\nthe now defunct Jazz Composers Guild.<br />\nOriginally composed of such artists as<br />\nCecil Taylor, Sun Ra, Archie Shepp, and<br />\nCarla Bley, it existed for a short time as a<br />\nmusicians' co-operative, but eventually<br />\ndissolved due to internal disagreements.<br />\nIn 1966, JCOA phoenixed out of its remains, and has been operating more or<br />\nless successfully every since.<br />\nJCOA was originally organized by<br />\nMichael Mantler, Timothy Marquand, and<br />\nCarla Bley, and its early purposes were to<br />\nsponsor the Jazz Composers Orchestra<br />\n(including 'commissions, workshops, concerts, and recordings), and its recording<br />\nlabel, JCOA Records. The basis for the<br />\ngroup was to provide a vehicle for Jazz<br />\ncomposers who lack such exposure, and<br />\nto give the public a chance to hear the<br />\nnew music, in addition to giving badly<br />\nneeded work to many talented musicians.<br />\nMore importantly, JCOA Records was<br />\na totally artist-owned and artist-controlled record company.

Obviously the<br />\nrecord companies are getting rich, while<br />\nthese musicians are getting screwed.<br />\nThe NMDS labels operate on a totally<br />\ndifferent basis. The labels are artist owned<br />\nand controlled, and,the individual artist<br />\nhas the last say on his/her album. Further, the musicians(sidemen too) are payed on a royalty basis, with the exact<br />\nterms varying from session to session.<br />\nAmong the Musicians with their own labels are Omette Colemen (A.I.R. Records), Cecil Taylor (Unit Core), and<br />\nAndrew White (Andrew's Music). Also,<br />\nsome of the most important non-jazz new<br />\nmusic labels operate through NMDS,such<br />\nas C RI, the label of the American<br />\ncomposers John Cage,<br />\navant-garde<br />\nGeorge Crumb, and Mario Davidovski (to<br />\nname a few); and also Desto Records.<br />\nNMDS's biggest success story is that of<br />\nthe Strata-East Records. Founded in<br />\n1971 by trumpetist Charles Tolliver as an<br />\noutlet for previously suppressed musical<br />\ntalent, the label now boasts some of the<br />\nfinest artists in black music today.

Christ stated that<br />\nthis was indeed an interesting<br />\nidea, but that it would be extremely difficult to find a source<br />\nto provide this endowment,<br />\nwhich he estimated would have<br />\nto be as large as $100 or 200<br />\nmillion. He also observed that<br />\nthis experiment had been tried<br />\nbefore, notably at Rice University in Texas, which was founded<br />\nwith a specific \"no tuition\"<br />\nclause written into its charter.<br />\nAfter Some years of operation<br />\nthis procedure was found to be<br />\nunfeasible, and tuition became<br />\nnecessary.<br />\n- \"Should the funds for this proposal become available,\" Christ<br />\nsaid, \"it is far more likely that<br />\nthey would be applied toward<br />\nimproving our academic program,<br />\nrather than eliminating tuition<br />\n<br />\ncharges.\"<br />\nOwen's proposal offers an alternative plan that all University<br />\nexpansion be ceased, with the<br />\nunused revenue saved from this<br />\nsource invested to earn capital<br />\nfor tuition funding. Christ stated<br />\nthat while this is a reasonable alternative, the money could be<br />\nbetter used in improving and further developing academic programs.<br />\nHe agreed with Owen, however, that such a plan would be<br />\nvery helpful in attracting more<br />\npeople to apply, thus allowing<br />\nHopkins to be more selective in<br />\nadmission procedures.<br />\nThe budgetary report submitted by Christ and Owen Phillips<br />\nhighlights several areas where<br />\nUniversity spending could possibly be reduced, while providing<br />\nrelevent data and analyses. One<br />\narea of emphasis was the increase<br />\nin both personnel and expenditures in the Homewood administration. According to information contained in the report,<br />\nexpenditures for the administration have increased from 6.4 percent of the total Univeristy budget for fiscal year 1965 to a budgeted 10.2 percent for the current year.<br />\nThere has also been an increase<br />\nof a total of 11 people (65%) in<br />\nthe central Univeristy and Homewood personnel offices, and a<br />\nconsiderable increase in the Stu-<br />\n<br />\nCart Christ<br />\npast few years has gone almost<br />\ndent Affairs Office, a part of the<br />\nexclusively to the Arts and<br />\nadministration division.<br />\nSciences division, with a net incThese increases in relation to<br />\nrease of 13 percent in relation to<br />\nother areas of the budget are of<br />\nrevenues earned from the divispecific concern to Christ.

Goodnow expressed<br />\nhis \"personal dissatisfaction with<br />\nthe college era and its immature<br />\nemphasis upon the undergraduate<br /><br />\n41 .0.4\u2018'Z<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nS.<br /><br />\n\u00a3<br /><br />\nand his doings.\" While he voiced<br />\nno objections to having young<br />\nmen pursue their bachelors degrees, Goodnow came to the decision that the University had to<br />\nchoose between mass producing<br />\n\"educated men,\" or concentrating on turning out a limited<br />\nnumber of advanced collegiate<br />\nand post-graduate scholars.<br />\nThough his belief that undergraduates tended to disrupt the<br /><br />\n\"austere atmosphere\" of Hopkins<br />\ngained some support, it eventually became ,clear that the revenue<br />\nprovided by undergraduates was<br />\nindispensable, and Goodnow's<br />\nplan was never realized. As one<br />\ncolleague stated, \"It was a scholar's dream, but intelligible only<br />\nto scholars.\"<br />\nAt the opposite idealogical<br />\npole from Goodnow stands Dr.<br />\nIsaiah Bowman, fifth president of<br />\nHopkins.

Savitz and other<br />\ncritics of the present system\u2014including, astonishingly<br />\nenough, Honor Commission Chairwoman Ann Connor\u2014have<br />\npointed to a lack of cooperation on the part of students and<br />\nfaculty in reporting cheating, and technical errors in trial<br />\nprocedure as justification for a re-evaluation and perhaps<br />\nalteration of the Honor system. We feel, however, that these<br />\ntemporary and correctable difficulties should not lead the<br />\ncommittee to contemplate major changes in the system.<br />\nBy scrutinizing the particulars of the Commission's<br />\nfunction\u2014and emerging triumphantly with documented<br />\ncriticism\u2014Savitz and Connor have failed, we feel, to consider<br />\nthat an Honor Commission is not intended to be a busy and<br />\nwell-oiled grand jury. Its impact is mainly theatrical\u2014it<br />\nattempts to discourage cheating not by actually ferreting out<br />\nany substantial amount of miscreants, but by demonstrating<br />\nfor all the student body to see the terrible punishment<br />\nreserved for offenders.<br />\nThus, criticism that not enough convictions have been<br />\narrived at or that students shirk their responsibility to uphold<br />\nthe Honor code does not show any deficiency on the part of<br />\nthe Honor system. It does show that faculty and students<br />\nhave not lived up to the spirit of the Honor code, not that<br />\nthe Commission or the system has failed. Though we agree<br />\nwith Savitz and Connor that students and faculty must better<br />\nuphold the system, we do not feel that their failure to do so<br />\nto date justifies compromising the Honor system. Students<br />\nand faculty must be made to bear the burden of<br />\nresponsibility in upholding the Honor code. They can't very<br />\nwell refuse, can they?<br /><br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\nBy JOE GRIFFITH<br />\nThe recent article on Indo-China<br />\npublished in the News-Letter was<br />\nnotable for several deficiencies in<br />\nboth fact and logic, but also for its<br />\nnarrowness of perspective. I will<br />\nattempt to address the problems of<br />\nthe recent article and then offer a<br />\nfew observations on the place of<br />\nthe Viet Nam in the geo-political<br />\nconfiguration of Southeast Asia.<br />\nThe first statement which draws<br />\none's attention entails the presumptiveness of the author in the following, \"We went to the Embassy<br />\nnot only to warn the U.S. government that the American people<br />\nwill not stand for renewed and<br />\nheightened was, but also to awaken<br />\nother Americans to the situation in<br />\nIndo-China, and to expose Ford's<br />\nlies to the people in the United<br />\nStates.\" I submit that the \"we\",<br />\nthose representatives of the \"IndoChina Peace Campaign,\" \"The<br />\nAssembly to Save the Peace Agreements\" and other such nebulous<br />\ngorups are not in fact representatives of the American people or of<br />\ntheir \"will,\" as the author of the<br />\narticle puts it later. It is doubtful<br />\nthat most Americans have ever<br />\nheard of these groups save a<br />\nminority of the radical intellectual<br />\nelite whose primary purpose in<br />\nsuch groups appears to be a vindication of their own ideas about<br />\nwho should rule Indo-China. The<br />\nauthor seems to assume that some<br />\nsort of mandate on this particular<br />\nforeign policy issue resides with<br />\nthese groups. This the author has<br />\nfailed to show deomonstrably. In<br />\nfact the American people on the<br /><br />\nwhole seem to be extremely apatheitc to the Indo-China comflict,<br />\nas evidenced by the pitiful furnout<br />\nat recent protests both for and<br />\nagainst aid to South Viet Nam. In<br />\nthe same statement one hears of<br />\nboth \"the American people\" and<br />\n\"Other Americans.\" I Was hoping<br />\nthe author would explain the distinction between the two. She does<br />\nnot. In the third part of the statement one is informed of Mr. Ford's<br />\n\"lies to the American people.\"<br />\nThis is really rank with self righteosness. From what pedestal does<br />\nthe author presume to make such<br />\nan indictment, again with no_demonstratable evidence. Surely those<br />\nmembers of the American news<br />\nmedia who exposed the Watergate<br />\nmess would direct the same skill at,<br />\nincovering the \"lies\" of the present<br />\nAmerican president. Or perhaps<br />\nthe author presumes that all her<br />\nreaders have been imbibed so with<br />\nthe post-Watergate mentality that<br />\nit follows ipso facto that all politicians are \"liars.\" I don't think<br />\nmost readers hold this to be axiomatic and hence some explanation of<br />\nsuch a statement was necessary but<br />\nnot forthcoming.<br />\nThe article continues, \"As long<br />\nas our government officials are in<br />\nViet Nam making war, we feel we<br />\nhave the right to follow them with<br />\nprotest and expose.\" As to the first<br />\npoint the author of the article<br />\nshould be reminded that upwards<br />\nof 250.000 North Vietnamese regular army soldiers with millions in<br />\nSoviet and Chinese logistical support are not in South Viet Nam on<br />\na boy scout campout.

In seeking to uncover the roots of any friction between Dr. Wickwire and Dr. Bento<br />\nthe article overemphasized the<br />\nrole played by Dr. Wickwire in the<br />\n\"trial\" of those who disrupted an<br />\nAcademic Council meeting back in<br />\n1971. First, Dr. NN \u2014ire supported the students invotved, not<br />\nprofessors Pfeffer and Pepper, who<br />\nhandled their own defense. Second, although such events are subject to varient interpretation, if<br />\nany \"grilling\" was done, the far<br />\ngreater part was done by the students themselves, not by Dr. Wickwire.<br />\nChris loss\u00b0<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to address myself to<br />\nsome misconduct which I think is<br />\nevident in the reporting of the edit-<br /><br />\nors of the News-Letter. I believe<br />\nthat the editors have a responsibility to report accurately what is<br />\nhappening on campus. However in<br />\nhis two articles on the athletic financial aid situation, Mr. Duvoisin<br />\nhas overstepped his obligations to<br />\nthe point of deceiving his audience<br />\nabout what is really the truth. In<br />\naddition, he has blown up the<br />\nevent of several people quitting the<br />\nswim team into some sort of<br />\nWatergate type scandal which<br />\ndoesn't even exist. Mr. Duvoisin's<br />\nwriting is a superb example of<br />\nMcCarthy style rhetoric designed<br />\nto expose through half truths and<br />\nundocumented evidence grave<br />\n\"misconduct\" by Coach Comfort,<br />\nand Wayne Hood at the Financial<br />\nAid Office. Only this time it is<br />\nDuvoisin instead of McCarthy who<br />\nholds the imaginary list of names<br />\nand allegations right there in his<br />\npocket.<br />\nIn my opinion, sending<br />\nrecommendations to the Admissions Office is a perfectly legitimate practice and not misconduct<br />\nas Mr. Duvoisin charges. I'm sure<br />\nthat everyone in this school has<br />\nhad letters of recommendation<br />\nwritten on their behalf. Should<br />\nathletes be discouraged from emphasizing their athletic ability during the admissions procedure while<br />\nat the same time others are encouraged to emphasize their strong<br />\npoints such as music, debating, or<br />\nacting? I'm sure that Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin's journalistic ability was a<br />\npositive factor in his acceptance<br />\nhere at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIn respect to Duvoisin's allegations about a tie between Coach<br />\nComfort and the Financial Aid office, he offers no proof at all. He<br />\nrelies on anonymous hearsay and<br />\ninformation released to the News-<br /><br />\nLetter that \"suggests\" that Coach<br />\nComfort has had' more communication with Financial Aid than he<br />\nadmits. Must we be obliged to take<br />\nhis work on this very important<br />\nissue?<br />\nMr. Duvoisin has invented this<br />\nmisconduct to serve his own purposes, and has based his destructive<br />\nallegations on hearsay, half truths<br />\nand lies. I \"suggest\" that one could<br />\nfind more misconduct among the<br />\nNews-Letter editors if one took the<br />\ntime to look. I know that in the<br />\nfuture I will hesitate to take for<br />\ngranted what Mr. Duvoisin says in<br />\nhis articles, and I will always wonder whether he is telling the truth,<br />\nor trying to pull the wool over my<br />\neyes.<br />\nPeter J.

In this article<br />\nthe Thieu government is pictured<br />\nas repressive and arbitrary, but certainly the Northern government<br />\npossesses these qualities of totalitarianism and much more.

I am not advocating the reappearance of an<br />\nAmerican army in Vietnam, I am<br />\nsimply stating that peace of the<br />\nworld rests on the failure of invasion in any part of the world.<br />\nIn my mind anyone accepting<br />\nthe march of communism by invasion (as Miz Kolchin obviously<br />\ndoes by her failure to mention the<br />\nabove concerns) is relinquished to<br />\nMarxist-Leninist doctrine of socialist inevitability. If she would simply state her ideological preference<br />\nclearly for us to read, instead of<br />\nhiding it with verbiage concerning<br />\nan unAmerican Saigon government, I could bear the publication<br />\nof such propaganda in the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter with greater ease.<br /><br />\npoint is interesting.

But this is of<br />\npassing interest and obscures one<br />\nof the key ideas which pervades a<br />\ngreat deal of the article. Though<br />\nthe distinction is often blurred in<br />\nthe American press, there is a difference between those who wish<br />\nfor the demise of Mr. Thieu and<br />\nthose who wish for the extension<br />\nof North Vietnamese political<br />\nhegemony over the whole of IndoChina. The with drawl of American<br />\naid whether immediate or slow<br />\nwould bring down more than just<br />\nthe Thieu regime and the responsible members of the South<br />\nVietnamese opposition realize this.<br />\nThose members of the Army,<br />\nwhich forms a sizable proportion<br />\nof the population, the great numbers of deserters from the North<br />\nVietnamese Army, those hundreds<br />\nof thousands of Catholics who fled<br />\nNorth Viet Nam during the partition, the refugees from rocket<br />\nattacks on civiliam population centers of no military value, and the<br />\nmembers of the South Vietnamese<br />\n,administrative apparatus down to<br />\nthe hamlet chiefs and teachers, are<br />\nnot resisting the North Vietnamese<br />\narmy out of any particular continued American aid that they can resist.<br />\nSurely the Thieu regime is corrupt, there is plenty of evidence<br />\nthat the North Vietnamese government is also corrupt and it is a fact<br />\nthat there is a sizable black market<br />\nin North Viet Nam.

The first<br />\nrequirement is an adequate supply of talented, experienced athletes, and the second is the<br />\ncoach, who provides leadership<br />\nand guidance for the team. For<br />\nthe Hopkins wrestling team, this<br />\nman is Harry Gotwals.<br />\nCoach Gotwals, 27 years of<br />\nage, is a native of Chambersburg,<br />\nPennsylvania. He attended Chambersburg High School taking a<br />\ncollege preparatory curriculum.,<br />\none that would eventually bring<br />\nhim to Johns Hopkins as an<br />\nundergraduate.<br />\nOddly enough, Gotwals did<br />\nnot begin his athletic career as a<br />\nwrestler, but as a basketball player. He played basketball in ninth<br />\nand tenth grades but found his<br />\nimportance declining in his<br />\ncoach's eyes and began participating in intermural wrestling.<br />\nWhen he was a junior, Chambersburg introduced wrestling at the<br />\nvarsity level and Gotwals went<br />\nout for the team. He was a starter<br />\nby mid-season wrestling at 127.<br />\nAs a senior, he was co-captain of<br />\nthe squad picking up his share of<br />\nwins and losses including a thirteen second pin.<br />\nGotwals came to Hopkins in<br />\n1965 as a student and also participated in the wrestling program<br />\ncompiling a fair record in his four'<br />\nyear career. His personal realationships with other members of<br />\nthe team played a factor in his<br />\ndesire to coach. Upon graduation, Gotwals obtained a job<br />\nteaching at Boy's Latin in<br />\nBaltimore where he taught and<br />\ncoached wrestling for two years.<br />\nFour years ago, he was offered<br />\nan opportunity by Johns<br /><br />\nHopkins to work for the<br />\nUniversity raising funds. When he<br />\nreturned to Homewood, he expressed an interest in assistant<br />\ncoaching job in wrestling.<br />\nHopkins couldn't pay him but he<br />\ndecided to work out with the<br />\nteam anyway. One week later,<br />\nthe head coach quit and Gotwals<br />\ngot the top job.<br />\nIn his four seasons as a coach,<br />\nHopkins has had three winning<br />\nseasons. But he doesn't take<br />\nmuch credit for his team's performances. \"I just try to catch mistakes, picking up the good things<br />\nathletes do and try to develop<br />\nthem,\" commented Gotwals.<br />\n\"One reason we have been as fortunate in winning and losing is<br />\nthe role that trainer Leroy<br />\nBrandimore has played.

Slowly rising<br />\nto his feet, with one hand -on his aching<br />\nhead, he stumbled for a few steps before<br />\ncollapsing. Once again he climbed, to his<br />\nfeet, leaning on a nearby banana tree for<br />\nsupport. Bill .felt very weak.

He asked the girl behind the counter if there were any tables nearby where<br />\nhe could eat. She seemed a bit nervous<br />\nabout speaking, he thought, and with<br />\ngood reason, for she had hardly said four<br />\nwords when a loud voice startled them.

CONSIDINE<br />\nFor years\u201emusicianshave been generally classed as performers or composers,<br />\nsometimes as both. For the performer,<br />\nthere was only the outlet of performance,<br />\nwhich suited their needs, while the composer had the options of performance<br />\nand/or publication of his work, and the<br />\nneeds of one group generally fed the<br />\nother.<br />\nThings are no longer so simple. Today<br />\nthere are composer/performers whose<br />\nmusic is improvisatory in nature, and who<br />\nmust Ile recorded in order that their<br />\nmusic does not die. And there is also a<br />\nlarge group of composers whose work is<br />\nso complex that it is seldom performed,<br />\nand without the recorded media they<br />\nwould also remain virtually unknown.<br />\nTherefore, the key to their survival is the<br />\nrecord industry.<br />\nHowever, when dealing with avantgarde) music (the generic term for many<br />\nof thse musicians), the record industry is<br />\ncold and heartless. To them, the low sales<br />\nlevels of this \"new music\" constitues a<br />\nsacrilege of their most sacred priciples,<br />\nthe almighty profit dollar.<br />\nThe consequences are devastating to<br />\nthe new music and musicians. Many, in<br />\norder to get recorded, must sacrifice their<br />\nstandards and adapt their music to the<br />\nsales oriented commerical format that<br />\nsome studio A&amp;R man gives them. Often<br />\nthey have little or no say in what (if anything) goes into \"their\" record, or how it<br />\nis packaged, publicised, or marketed.<br />\nSome examples include Miles Davis,<br />\nwho (according to Leonard Feather in the<br />\nFebruary 8 issue of Bilboard) was told in<br />\nthe late\u2022sixties to do something about his<br /><br />\nthe Orchestra featuring Cecil Taylor,<br />\nPharoah Sanders, Larry Coryell, and, the<br />\nthen unknown Gato Barbieri.<br />\nSince then they have released Compositions by Don Cherry, Rosewell Rudd,<br />\nand Carla Bley. Carla Bley's work was an<br />\nopera of sorts called Escalator Over the<br />\nHill, and it is probably the underground<br />\nsleeper of the decade. Her work is a combination jazz-rock-electronic music opera<br />\nwhich combine such talents as Gato<br />\nBarbier i, Don Cherry, Viva, Linda Ronstadt, and the combination of Jack Bruce<br />\nand John McLaughlin.<br />\nIn 1972, JCOA founded the New<br />\nMusic Distribution Service, in order to<br />\ndistribute the recorded, comissioned<br />\nworks of JCOA composers; to distribute<br />\nthe records of other independent new<br />\nmusic labels; and to support an alternate<br />\nsystem of recording and distribution for<br />\nnon-commercial music.<br />\nOf their three objectives, the last is<br />\nprobably the most important. Most major<br />\nlabels (like Columbia, for example) and<br />\ntheir affiliates (e.g., Bamaby, Bell, Epic,<br />\nOdyssey, Windfall, and brand-new Artista), are run in order the make profits.<br />\nThe product is generally closely<br />\ncontrolled by the producer, who is controlled by the corporation, which is directed by when they feel their sales should<br />\nbe, and in which markets. Many labels refuse to handle Jazz or New music on the<br />\ngrounds that it does not sell enough to<br />\nwarrant the investment. In the event that<br />\nthey do handle jazz artists, the artist is<br />\nrestricted by the producer in what gets to<br />\nbecome the product, and how is to be<br />\npackaged.<br />\nAs for the payment, it is often the case<br /><br />\nlagging sales, or find another label\u2014i.e.<br />\n\"sell out or else.\" Saxophonist Ornette<br />\nColeman, despite the fact that he is acclaimed as the most major innovator on,<br />\nsaxophone since Charlie Parker, has been<br />\nat various times with 7 different record<br />\ncompanies, one of which even told him<br />\nthat he owed them money. And Cecil<br />\nTaylor has had albums take as long at 13<br />\nyears to be released.<br />\nWhile some artists have sold out, and<br />\nsome have gone unrecorded, others have<br />\nfound a solution in the Jazz Composers<br />\nOrchestra Association and its New Music<br />\nDistribution Serivce(JCOA/NMDS).<br />\nThe idea for JCOA blossomed out of<br />\nthe now defunct Jazz Composers Guild.<br />\nOriginally composed of such artists as<br />\nCecil Taylor, Sun Ra, Archie Shepp, and<br />\nCarla Bley, it existed for a short time as a<br />\nmusicians' co-operative, but eventually<br />\ndissolved due to internal disagreements.<br />\nIn 1966, JCOA phoenixed out of its remains, and has been operating more or<br />\nless successfully every since.<br />\nJCOA was originally organized by<br />\nMichael Mantler, Timothy Marquand, and<br />\nCarla Bley, and its early purposes were to<br />\nsponsor the Jazz Composers Orchestra<br />\n(including 'commissions, workshops, concerts, and recordings), and its recording<br />\nlabel, JCOA Records. The basis for the<br />\ngroup was to provide a vehicle for Jazz<br />\ncomposers who lack such exposure, and<br />\nto give the public a chance to hear the<br />\nnew music, in addition to giving badly<br />\nneeded work to many talented musicians.<br />\nMore importantly, JCOA Records was<br />\na totally artist-owned and artist-controlled record company.

Obviously the<br />\nrecord companies are getting rich, while<br />\nthese musicians are getting screwed.<br />\nThe NMDS labels operate on a totally<br />\ndifferent basis. The labels are artist owned<br />\nand controlled, and,the individual artist<br />\nhas the last say on his/her album. Further, the musicians(sidemen too) are payed on a royalty basis, with the exact<br />\nterms varying from session to session.<br />\nAmong the Musicians with their own labels are Omette Colemen (A.I.R. Records), Cecil Taylor (Unit Core), and<br />\nAndrew White (Andrew's Music). Also,<br />\nsome of the most important non-jazz new<br />\nmusic labels operate through NMDS,such<br />\nas C RI, the label of the American<br />\ncomposers John Cage,<br />\navant-garde<br />\nGeorge Crumb, and Mario Davidovski (to<br />\nname a few); and also Desto Records.<br />\nNMDS's biggest success story is that of<br />\nthe Strata-East Records.

Christ stated that<br />\nthis was indeed an interesting<br />\nidea, but that it would be extremely difficult to find a source<br />\nto provide this endowment,<br />\nwhich he estimated would have<br />\nto be as large as $100 or 200<br />\nmillion. He also observed that<br />\nthis experiment had been tried<br />\nbefore, notably at Rice University in Texas, which was founded<br />\nwith a specific \"no tuition\"<br />\nclause written into its charter.<br />\nAfter Some years of operation<br />\nthis procedure was found to be<br />\nunfeasible, and tuition became<br />\nnecessary.<br />\n- \"Should the funds for this proposal become available,\" Christ<br />\nsaid, \"it is far more likely that<br />\nthey would be applied toward<br />\nimproving our academic program,<br />\nrather than eliminating tuition<br /><br />\ncharges.\"<br />\nOwen's proposal offers an alternative plan that all University<br />\nexpansion be ceased, with the<br />\nunused revenue saved from this<br />\nsource invested to earn capital<br />\nfor tuition funding. Christ stated<br />\nthat while this is a reasonable alternative, the money could be<br />\nbetter used in improving and further developing academic programs.<br />\nHe agreed with Owen, however, that such a plan would be<br />\nvery helpful in attracting more<br />\npeople to apply, thus allowing<br />\nHopkins to be more selective in<br />\nadmission procedures.<br />\nThe budgetary report submitted by Christ and Owen Phillips<br />\nhighlights several areas where<br />\nUniversity spending could possibly be reduced, while providing<br />\nrelevent data and analyses. One<br />\narea of emphasis was the increase<br />\nin both personnel and expenditures in the Homewood administration. According to information contained in the report,<br />\nexpenditures for the administration have increased from 6.4 percent of the total Univeristy budget for fiscal year 1965 to a budgeted 10.2 percent for the current year.<br />\nThere has also been an increase<br />\nof a total of 11 people (65%) in<br />\nthe central Univeristy and Homewood personnel offices, and a<br />\nconsiderable increase in the Stu-<br /><br />\nCart Christ<br />\npast few years has gone almost<br />\ndent Affairs Office, a part of the<br />\nexclusively to the Arts and<br />\nadministration division.<br />\nSciences division, with a net incThese increases in relation to<br />\nrease of 13 percent in relation to<br />\nother areas of the budget are of<br />\nrevenues earned from the divispecific concern to Christ.
