While hanging there in the yard, I suddenly<br />\nfelt a moth climb under the flap of my left pocket. I<br />\nbroke out in a hot and cold sweat alternately. I felt<br />\nnauseous. The fright and dread of the thought of having<br />\nthis deadly enemy on my person all during those lonely<br />\nmonths of solitary confinement, gnawing at my entrails, was almost too much for me to bear. Perhaps<br />\nhe would be discovered and exterminated. But alas, fate<br />\nwas not so kind. Sometime about the first of June, by<br />\nmy figuring, I felt the moth crawl out from under the<br />\nflap to a more conspicuous place, and gorge himself<br />\nwith my flesh. Cessation of the biting into my side told<br />\nme the moth slept. About a month later I felt him<br />\nawaken and crawl to a still more conspicuous place .for<br />\nhis final meal. He was such a gluttonous fool that he<br />\nsuccumbed to a very severe atttak of dyspepsia, and fell<br />\nfrom my side to the floor.

Victories were<br />\nregistered over Wesleyan and Hamilton. However, the Lizzies will be materially strengthened by the return<br />\nto action of Bill Tiernan, stellar<br />\nquarterback, and elusive open-field<br />\nrunner, who has been out of action<br />\nalmost the entire season because of<br />\ninjuries sustained in an early encounter.

This same attitude has dominated the practices all during the<br />\nweek. The coaches have attempted<br />\nto iron out the flaws observed in<br />\nprevious frays, and have put the<br />\nsquad through frequent scrimmaging,<br />\nin order to attain this end. The main<br />\ntask was to improve the offensive<br />\nplay, since the Hopkins gridders have<br />\na very effective defense, especially<br />\nagainst passes, in which Kahl plays<br />\na prominent part.<br />\nThe Jays will most likely start the<br />\ngame with the same men that entered the contest against St. John's.

At<br />\nthe opening kick-off the backfield<br />\nwill most likely consist of Captain<br />\nPasarew at quarterback, whose kicking helped the Jays out of many uncomfortable positions in the last encounter, and whose open field running was one of the highlights of<br />\nthe day; Kahl, who proved his merit<br />\nby intercepting several passes on<br />\nSaturday at one halfback position;<br />\nand Vincenti, whose deadly tackling<br />\nand steady pep brace the line considerably, at the other halfback position; and Graziano, whose unstoppable plunging made him the outstanding man on the field in the tilt<br />\nWith the Johnnies.<br />\nThree members of the team, namely Pasarew, Otts Phillips, and McGuire, will have added incentive since<br />\nthese three men, all seniors, will be<br />\nPerforming in their last football game<br />\nfor the Hopkins, and consequently<br />\ncan be expected to put up an excellent exhibition.<br />\n<br />\nJay Walks<br />\nBy DAVID CAPLAN<br />\n<br />\nFootball Team To<br />\nDraw Curtain Tomorrow<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins football team<br />\ncloses an anything-but-successful season when it meets the Haverford<br />\neleven tomorrow<br />\nat<br />\nHomewood<br />\nField.<br />\nFor the first time this season, the<br />\nJays will go into a game with a<br />\nfifty-fifty chance of emerging the<br />\nvictor, and this chance will be accentuated by an earnest spirit on the<br />\npart of the team to end the season<br />\nwith a victory.

Victories were<br />\nregistered over Wesleyan and Hamilton. However, the Lizzies will be materially strengthened by the return<br />\nto action of Bill Tiernan, stellar<br />\nquarterback, and elusive open-field<br />\nrunner, who has been out of action<br />\nalmost the entire season because of<br />\ninjuries sustained in an early encounter.

The main<br />\ntask was to improve the offensive<br />\nplay, since the Hopkins gridders have<br />\na very effective defense, especially<br />\nagainst passes, in which Kahl plays<br />\na prominent part.<br />\nThe Jays will most likely start the<br />\ngame with the same men that entered the contest against St. John's.
