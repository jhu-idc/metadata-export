The practice was officially instituted<br />\nback in the forties by New York Mayor<br />\nFiorello LaGuardia as a means of<br />\ncontrolling the growing traffic congestion<br />\nin his metropolis. It was, to say the least,<br />\na horrible comeuppance for the suburban<br />\ncommuter who would decide, say, to let<br />\nthe meter run over an extra 10 minutes<br />\nwhile he was negotiating the price of that<br />\nbottle of Mateus, and return to find his<br />\nparking space vacant.<br />\nAfter the initial stage of thinking his<br />\ncar stolen or lost, he realized what had<br />\nhappened. And after the secondary stage<br />\nof outrage at having his vehicle abducted,<br />\nhe began to think what a long walk it<br />\nwould be back across the Hudson and,<br />\nlike as not, took a bus downtown to pay<br />\nhis dues. For about a decade, New York<br />\ndevoted a full square mile on Welfare<br />\nIsland to housing towed cars, so large<br />\nwere the daily heists. Not only did the<br />\ntraffic congestion get better, but the city<br />\nwas able to avert God knows how many<br />\nbudget deficits\u2014all due to the towing<br />\nbusiness.<br />\nOther cities took the cue therefrom<br />\nand,by that process we call specialization,<br />\nmade the penalty of towing an effective<br />\nand fear-inspiring caveat.

The<br />\npolice would no sooner enforce back<br />\nviolations than they would rage through<br />\nthe Charles Village arresting/ every soul<br />\nwith a fleck of marijuana on his person.<br />\nYou just don't do that.<br />\nBut the Baltimore Police Department<br />\nhas ushered in a new era in parking<br />\nviolations\u2014the end of innocence,<br />\ncourtesy of their new computer: a<br />\nleviathan IBM (takes up to one-third of<br />\nthe new central headquarters downtown,<br />\naccording to one of the many policemen I<br />\nwas to encounter) which can conduct<br />\nnationwide scans of motor vehicles<br />\nbureaus at a moment's notice. I was, I<br />\nsuspect, one of its first victims.<br />\nWhile walking through campus one<br />\nmorning last week discussing with a<br />\nfriend our impending intersession<br />\nexcursion to Mexico, I was accosted<br />\nby a breathless colleague: \"Hurry up,<br />\nthey're towing your car.\" I sprinted down<br />\nto Art Museum Drive to find the car<br />\nsuspended from the maw of a large<br />\norange towing rig, a small crowd of<br />\ncurious passers-by watching as one Officer<br />\nC.L. Rummel affixed a parking citation<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nto the windshield.<br />\n\"Excuse me,\" I interjected. \"That's my<br />\ncar.\"<br />\n\"Nope. Mine now,\" replied the officer.<br />\n\"How come?\"<br />\n\"Son,you've got a $117 due on this<br />\ncar,\" Rummel explained, pulling out a<br />\nyellow print-out cataloguing a surfeit of<br />\nback violations next to my license plate<br />\nnumber. A new computer, he said, was<br />\nhelping police track down out of state<br />\nviolators.<br />\nAbove my protestations, Rummel<br />\ninsisted that the car would have to be<br />\ntowed\u2014impounded really\u2014until the<br />\nviolations were paid for. As the tow truck<br />\npulled down Charles Street and out of<br />\nsight, friends and passers-by alike were<br />\n<br />\nlaughing, behind their rueful faces of<br />\naffected concern, at the total abjectness<br />\nof my situation. They were taking my<br />\ncar\u2014and I couldn't do anything about it.<br />\nOfficer Rummel, however, acquitted<br />\nhimself like a true servant of the public,<br />\ntabulating each and every back fine for<br />\nmy benefit, and giving me the address of<br />\nthe site of incarceration, and the parking<br />\nfine office. The final figure I owed,<br />\ntowing and storage charges included, was<br />\na staggering $117.<br />\nHow to raise such a sum? I knew for<br />\ncertain that all of the myriad fines<br />\nweren't my own\u2014I had always been<br />\nliberal in lending out my car. So I decided<br />\nthat the taxman would have to cometh to<br />\nthe houses of a few of the more frequent<br />\n<br />\nborrowers of the vehicle.

No hassle<br />\nwhatsoever in paying up my parking<br />\ntickets and accrued late fines\u2014the people<br />\nwere all too happy to accept my money.<br />\nI was advised to get over to the impound<br />\nlot on the harbor and pay the towing fine<br />\nwith dispatch, since the vehicle would<br />\nonly be held there for three days.<br />\nWhether the car would be thrown into<br />\nthe harbor at the end of that period, theY<br />\nwould not specify.<br />\nLikewise at the impound lot, the<br />\ncashier was gratified to accept my check,<br />\ntreating us to four ritual<br />\nmispronunciations of our grand<br />\ninstitution's name as she perused mY<br />\nHopkins ID.<br />\nThe dues paid, we got into the car and<br />\nembarked on the short sojourn up Charles<br />\nStreet.

My Book is the King<br />\nJames Version of the Bible\u2014the best<br />\nexample of the everlasting power of the<br />\nwritten word!'<br />\nThis is :James J. Kilpatrick in<br />\nWashington.<br />\n<br />\nWomen's strike provokes some new awareness<br />\nBy D.H. WARREN<br />\nhad just finished reading about<br />\nWomen's Strike Day and scratched my<br />\nbeard a few times, pretending to give the<br />\nWhole subject serious consideration. This<br />\nwas supposed to be a national event, and<br />\neven though I try to shut myself off from<br />\nthe humdrum day-to-day problems by<br />\nnot watching television or reading daily<br />\npapers, I wondered how it was going to<br />\naffect me, not to mention the Hop, which<br />\nisn't the kind of place where you expect<br />\nStrikes or protests or revolutionary<br />\nthinking. No, we're all too caught up in<br />\nthat \"pre-professional hysteria.\" Nothing<br />\nlike it to make you forget about starving<br />\nPeople, crooked politicians, higher prices,<br />\nand all the rest of the garbage that<br />\noccupies family dinner tables. Yes, there<br />\nare some advantages to being concerned<br />\nWith no one's future but your own.<br />\nHowever, I digress.<br />\nSupposedly, women were even going to<br />\nextend their strike to their activity in<br />\n-bed. Now, that's intense. I wondered if<br />\nLayla was going to go that far. Neither of<br />\nus had ever forced sex on the other if he<br />\nor she did not want to. And even though<br />\nmost of my so-called \"male<br />\nbrothers\"\u2014and for that matter, the<br />\nfemales,too\u2014 won't admit it, men aren't<br />\nalways horny. At the Hop, anybody will<br />\ntell you that if the girls didn't take any<br />\ninitiative, the boys would still be sitting<br />\naround bitching how Hopkins females<br />\nnever \u2022 want to go out. Let's face it, the<br />\nAmerican male is basically a very neurotic<br />\ncreature who has been raised with the<br />\nmyth that he is superior, and when he<br />\ndiscovers that it ain't necessarily so, he<br />\nbecomes a shattered ego with terminal<br />\nimpotence. But I digress.<br />\nWhen I got up the' next morning,<br />\ncuriosity was on my mind. What was<br />\nWomen's Strike Day going to be like?<br />\nWould there be a lot of feminist bullshit<br />\nfollowed by even worse male bullshit in<br />\nmy classes? Or would the women just not<br />\ngo to classes, while men made sly remarks<br />\nabout their sex lives? I wondered, and<br />\nwas beginning to really think about it all.<br />\nMy Morning class had all the women<br />\nthere. Some small talk went around the<br />\ncar about the Strike (we were on, a field<br />\ntrip) and the women didn't seem very<br />\nimpressed by the whole thing. I figured<br />\nthey're the kind of people who have<br />\nalready found their sexual identity and<br />\nnow have more important things on their<br />\nminds. They're distinct individuals who<br />\n<br />\nwon't be molded to something called<br />\n\"men's values\" or any other type of<br />\nthinking that no longer treats them as<br />\nindividuals. I was impressed. A woman<br />\nis a category. A person is something real.<br />\nOne , of the guys in the class<br />\nmentioned that there was a group of<br />\nwomen in New York City who were<br />\npurposely going to fix their husbands'<br />\nfavorite meals, and be extra nice to<br />\nhubby. I don't believe in marriage, at<br />\nleast not for me. Every time I read<br />\n\"Rope,\" by Katherine Anne Porter, I'm<br />\nconvinced that I am correct. But perhaps<br />\nthat was how Chose women in New York<br />\nfound their sexual identity. I felt sorry<br />\nfor them.<br />\nThat afternoon at the grocery store, I<br />\nnoticed several mothers busily shopping<br />\nand taking care of their young children. I<br />\n<br />\nsuppose they didn't have time to strike. It<br />\nwould have to be put off until the kids<br />\ngraduated from college. I had to respect<br />\nthem. I gave my parents hell when I was<br />\ngrowing up. That's probably why I don't<br />\nlook forward to having any children.<br />\nSome people have got to be parents<br />\nthough, especially if I want another<br />\ngeneration of readers. There's a situation<br />\nthat definitely needs improvement. Men<br />\nhave got to do more than just start the<br />\nbabies. I decided I was 100 per cent pro<br />\nmale pregnancies. Once again, though, I<br />\ndigress.<br />\nThere were some unescorted males<br />\nshopping at the grocery store, also. I<br />\nwondered if they were husbands of<br />\nmilitant wives who had been sent to the<br />\nstore. Or maybe they were just spouses<br />\nwho saw nothing wrong With helping out<br />\n<br />\nand always did the groceries. More than<br />\nlikely, however, they were bachelors, who<br />\nknew that if they didn't feed<br />\nthemselves, who would? Jeez, the grocery<br />\nstore is the great equalizer of life.<br />\nThat night I saw Layla and asked her<br />\nwhat she had done for Women's Strike<br />\nDay. She looked at me very seriously, and<br />\nthen Suddenly burst out into fits of<br />\nlaughter. You silly, she said, I was just<br />\nmyself today, because that's what it was<br />\nall about.<br />\nYou've got to find yourself first, I<br />\nreminded her.<br />\nYes, she said knowingly, and once<br />\nyou've found yourself, you can't let<br />\nanybody take it away from you.<br />\n- But how could they, if you don't (et<br />\nthem?<br />\n\u2014<br />\nPrecisely.<br />\n<br />\nHearts of the West: well, not really<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\nIf Hearts of the West, billed as \"MGM's<br />\nComedy Surprise,\" is a comedy, then it's<br />\nsurprise to me, not because the movie is a<br />\nfailure, but because of the usual<br />\nmisleading Hollywood publicity. Hearts<br />\nof the West is a droll \"coMedy-drama\"<br />\n(for lack of a better genre) that lingers<br />\nlike a nostalgic memory in the back of<br />\nyour mind.<br />\nLewis Tater (perfectly played by Jeff<br />\nBridges) is a dreamy Iowa farmboy who<br />\nwrites pulp Western stories and aspires to<br />\nbe like his idol, Zane Grey. He goes out<br />\nwest to attend the Univeristy of Titan<br />\n(\"nestled qt the foot of silver-veined<br />\nmountain's\" their brochure reads) to learn<br />\nhow to be a writer but discovers the<br />\nuniversity is only a, series of post office<br />\nboxes. Lewis then stumbles his way<br />\nthrough some very ordinary picares'que<br />\nadventures (the film's only weakness)and<br />\neventually ends up as a bit player in<br />\nTumbleweed Productions' latest cheap<br />\nwestern.<br />\nWorking for the movies he meets some<br />\narchetypical Hollywood characters. First<br />\nthere is the director, Kessler (portrayed<br />\nwith almost anti-Semitic overtones by<br />\nAlan Arkin) whose silliness is cleverly<br />\ncalculated; his penny-pinching bargaining<br />\nwith the cowboys, his hysterical Yiddish<br />\nwhen directing a terrible fight scene, and<br />\nhis Knute Rockne-type pep talk he gives<br />\nto the cowboys to keep their flagging<br />\n<br />\nspirits up. Arkin plays Kessler so<br />\nintensely his performance is funny and<br />\nsucceeds quite well. He's exactly the son<br />\nof a bitch we expect.<br />\nBlythe Danner plays Trout, Kessler<br />\nscript girl. Trout is the kind of girl you<br />\nwould imagine to be working in<br />\nHollywood at the time, the early thirties.<br />\nShe's cynical and tough but still an<br />\noutsider (the only female in an all-male<br />\nproduction company) trying to wise up<br />\nthe young inexperience here, later.<br />\nBlythe Danner's performance invokes the<br />\nghosts of Jean Arthur trying to initiate<br />\nJimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper in \"Mr.<br />\nSmith Goes to Washington'. and \"Mr.<br />\nDeeds Goes to Town,\" two of the most<br />\npopular movies of the decade.<br />\nFather-Figure<br />\nAs Howard Pike, an aging cowboy<br />\nactor, Andy Griffith shows for the first<br />\ntime in a long while that he is a very<br />\ncapable actor. His performance mocks the<br />\nhokey sheriff he played on his own<br />\ntelevision show but echoes back to his<br />\nstunning screen debut in Kazan's \"A Face<br />\nin the Crowd\" when he played a country<br />\nsinger elevated to a tragic demagogue.<br />\nThere is a certain sad, nostalgic<br />\nruggedness ingrained in his face that<br />\nmakes him the perfect father-figure to<br />\nLewis which inevitably leads to cruel<br />\ndisillusionment.<br />\nAll these characters are, to use a<br />\nHollywood cliche, memorable, and the<br />\n<br />\nonly thing wrong is that we see too little<br />\nof them. The picaresque adventures I<br />\nmentioned before limit the film to a<br />\nrather tedious plot that is irrelevant to<br />\nthe theme. The film centers on Lewis'<br />\nrealization of the truth about Western<br />\nmyths. He realizes the Western is not<br />\noverblown reality but desperate creations<br />\nof men more concerned with money than<br />\nideals. To Lewis, Westerns are not what<br />\nthey're cracked up to be.<br />\nBesides Hearts of the West at the<br />\nRotunda, this weekend Once Is Not<br />\nEnough, typical Jacqueline Susann trash,<br />\nis playing at the other Rotunda cinema.<br />\nOver at the Boulevard ($1.50 at all times)<br />\nis,a re-release of last year's most overrated<br />\npicture, The Godfather\u2014Part II.

Kids need<br />\nto be fed information, provoked into<br />\nspouting it; they need a \u2022 lot of<br />\nindividualized attention. In the ghetto<br />\nsome fathers do stay drunk all day and<br />\nvent years of frustrations by beating kids.<br />\nSome mothers do leave six-year-olds in<br />\ncharge of sisters and brothers for an<br />\nentire working day. But love and honest<br />\nparental concern do have a place.<br />\nStreet-hardened fathers won't allow their<br />\nchildren to be tempered by a similar<br />\nenvironment. They know that it takes<br />\ntwelve hours of backbreaking work to<br />\nkeep food on the table. They know what<br />\nis lacking; they want a superior<br />\neducational opportunity for their<br />\nchildren. Just a chance for their kids to<br />\npull themselves up by President Ford's<br />\n\"bootstraps.\" A solid community can<br />\nmake it work. There are such<br />\ncommunities in Baltimore.<br />\nThe'elementary schools, the only forte<br />\nof the Baltimore public school system,<br />\nwork to some extent. Little racial strife;<br />\nfew problems with forced integration,<br />\nand a lot of learning. Positive beginnings<br />\nfor most kids entering school. They offer<br />\na basic standardized curriculum aimed<br />\n\u2022<br />\nslightly above the capabilities of the<br />\naverage student. Challenge is present:<br />\ncertainly not up to par with that at a first<br />\nrate county school, but an important<br />\nstimulative factor. However, as talented<br />\nand enthusiastic as any teacher might be,<br />\nthere are severe limitations. Large classes,<br />\npoor or nonexistent supplies, discipline<br />\nand motivational problems bog the<br />\nsystem down. Students aren't even<br />\nallowed to take textbooks home in many<br />\ninstances, aren't encouraged to learn<br />\noutside of class. Obviously an alternative<br />\nto augment and reinforce this struggling<br />\nsystem is necessary and does presently<br />\nexist on a limited scale. There is a<br />\nprogram in which over a hundred and<br />\nfifty elementary schoolchildren, from<br />\nthree radically different neighborhoods,<br />\nare individually \"tutored\"- by local high<br />\nschool and college students. It's run by<br />\nthe Office of the Chaplain, and it's the<br />\nlargest of its kind in Baltimore. It is<br />\ninvaluable to the kids participating and to<br />\nthe community they come from: the<br />\nghettos of Baltimore.<br />\nThree well-defined geographical areas<br />\nare involved: Northwest (Fulton and<br />\nCalhoun Streets), Southwest (Franklin<br />\nSt.), and Eastern (Broadway and Hopkins<br />\nHospital). The make-up of the<br />\n<br />\nneighborhoods vary, some all black, some<br />\na mixture. But the kids have two things in<br />\ncommon: they all are impoverished and<br />\nthey are willing to spend two afternoons<br />\na week at Hopkins, supplementing their<br />\neducation\u2014academic and social.<br />\nMy encounter with this network has<br />\nbeen. as a tutor through the Calhoun<br />\nStreet Community Center. Immediately<br />\nyou'll notice a poor black neighborhood,<br />\ndrunks sleeping on doorsteps, and<br />\ncolorful .murals on tenement walls. Hope<br />\nand desperation side by side. An<br />\nuncomfortable feeling will accompany<br />\nyour introduction to the type of<br />\ncommunity where 70 per cent of<br />\nBaltimore's blacks live. It is threatening in<br />\na pathetic way.<br />\nThe Calhoun Center is kids. Two<br />\nafternoons a week it's teemir.g with kids.<br />\nThe Center is a stalwart remnant from the<br />\nWar on Poverty, that was publicized<br />\nextensively in the mid and late sixties.<br />\nFederal budget cuts have eliminated two<br />\nthirds of the total number of centers. Not<br />\nsurprisingly, all of the centers that were<br />\nconnected with the Hopkins tutoring<br />\nprogram remained open. Someone<br />\nsomewhere determined that these were<br />\nthe centers most valuable to the<br />\ncomm unity.<br />\nThe community knows about the<br />\nHopkins tutoring program. People are<br />\nrecognized on the street and are<br />\n<br />\nappreciated and in a certain sense<br />\nsheltered. The word has spread very<br />\nquickly along the local grapevine. No<br />\npublicity is necessary, -the good word<br />\nspreads from brother to sister to cousin.<br />\nThe program\u2014an all-volunteer project\u2014is<br />\njust able to cope with the numbers<br />\npresently involved.<br />\nThat isn't the whole story of course; in<br />\na metropolitan area this large there are<br />\nmore than a hundred and fifty kids who<br />\ndesire and need the attention. There. are<br />\nonly 50 kids waiting on the community<br />\ncenter lists, hut the word has spread.<br />\n<br />\nCity-wide, there is a mounting backlog of<br />\nover 400.<br />\nIt has taken more than ten years to<br />\nplant this tentative seed. It finally seems<br />\nto be nourishing itself, propagating, and<br />\n_even spreading. It's time to graduallY<br />\nreturn control and responsibility to the<br />\ncommunities themselves. The numbers<br />\nhave exceeded our meager capabilities.<br />\nThere are adults and older children who<br />\nfeel the need, and have the basic<br />\nknowledge necessary to inspire, motivate,<br />\nand uplift. Future Angelos need to know<br />\nthe details.<br />\n<br />\nWhere's Ron<br />\n<br />\nMingling and Explicating in T&S<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nLike I was telling Willy, it sure was<br />\nlucky that I checked my mailbox<br />\nyesterday. It was an afterthought, I<br />\nadmit, checking the box, but the letter<br />\nfrom the English Department, stuffed<br />\nbetween old Barnstormer solicitations<br />\nand Student Council \"progress reports,\"<br />\nconfirmed a belief I'll always hang onto:<br />\nbig things come in small packages.<br />\nIt wasn't that I hadn't expected good<br />\nnews from the English Department, but<br />\nthe invite to the Tudor and Stuart Room<br />\nfor an informal, but one could be sure<br />\ntasteful, gathering of the forty English<br />\nmajors at Hopkins took me by surprise.<br />\nImagine, I thought, the entire English<br />\nDepartment rallying together for a real<br />\nevent, everyone invited, undergraduates<br />\ntoo! The lunchroom was abuzz with<br />\nrumors that last year's chairman, Ronald<br />\nPaulson would be in attendance, possibly<br />\nto read from his upcoming work, Hogarth<br />\nand Norman Mader: Beyond the Grave<br />\nand Across the Centuries.<br />\nInvitation in hand, I approached the<br />\n<br />\nmusty Victorian confines of the Tudor<br />\nand Stuart Room, ready to mingle and<br />\nexplicate, for a shabby affair this could<br />\nnot be. Entering the room, I was received<br />\nby the current chairman, someone who<br />\nisn't exactly a household word but who is<br />\nknown in literary circles. He was all<br />\nsmiles as he scarfed down Utz thin<br />\npretzels with one hand, while clutching a<br />\ncan of National Boh in the other. All<br />\nright, I say to myself, so it's not a wine<br />\nand cheese affair. That kind of party is<br />\nprobably dated by now anyway.<br />\nBut if the refreshments were less than<br />\nfitting, the company was fine. Scattered<br />\namong the approximately fifteen<br />\nstudents, were not only the blood and<br />\nguts of tomorrow's English Department,<br />\nthe Fergusons, the Michaels, the Wellers,<br />\nbut smor faculty members as well. The<br />\nprofessors seemed in jubilant spirits as<br />\nthey introduced themselves to new faces,<br />\npointing with a smile of camaraderie to<br />\nthe six-packs of beer and bags of cheetos<br />\non the oak table.<br />\nThe conversation never lagged.<br />\n<br />\nStudents, quickly gravitated towards their<br />\nfavorite prof, in hopes of netting nuggets<br />\nabout graduate school, and the other<br />\nsteps on the ladder to an English<br />\nprofessorship. I heard one especially<br />\nstimulating exchange between a student<br />\nand one of the professors. It only lasted a<br />\ncouple of minutes, but what they packed<br />\nin there, could take a lifetime to study.<br />\nStarting with recitations in Old English of<br />\nChaucer's Canterbury Tales, the duo<br />\ndiscussed the pros and cons of Dickens'<br />\nlater novels, Byron vs. Shelley, and<br />\nwhether Robinson Crusoe is really the<br />\nfirst English Novel. From the last<br />\nquestion, heated words were almost<br />\nsprung, if not for the cool of another<br />\nprofessor, who hushed the matter with an<br />\nappropriate quote from Browning.<br />\nSadly, after almost two hours, it was<br />\ntime to leave. We all agreed that we'd get<br />\ntogether more often. It had worked out<br />\nso well, and not one student's smile faded<br />\nwhen one of the professors waved<br />\ngoodbye and said, \"It's been great, see<br />\nyou next year.\"<br />\n<br />\n\foctoher 31, 1975/-tews-letter/page 5<br />\n4E06MA YAMSMSXIS3<br />\n<br />\n=iflagXSAORSMS<br />\n<br />\nMOSIKOZIME<br />\n<br />\nMSNAM<br />\n<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br />\n\"THE SUNDAY EXPERIENCE\"<br />\nGLOBAL HUNGER<br />\nwith<br />\nDAVID BURGESS<br />\nSenior Officer, UNICEF<br />\nUNITED NATIONS<br />\nSUNDAY, NOVEMBER 2,11:00 A.M.<br />\nLISTENING-VIEWING ROOM<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br />\n<br />\nA delicious Sirloin Steak<br />\nplus<br />\ngolden brown French Fries<br />\nplus<br />\n1 frosty pitcher of beer<br />\nplus<br />\nall the salad you want to make.<br />\n<br />\n11.10111411030:3201163146,MXISPASKINSINSIXAMIXISIXOWS310.11MiSi N<br />\nINFO & PHONE CHARGES: CALL (301) 363-0800<br />\n<br />\nFRANKIE<br />\nVALLI &<br />\n.FOIIR<br />\nSEASONS<br />\n<br />\nSteak, pitcher of beer and more.

But we<br />\nhad suggested upping work-study wages<br />\nto $2.75 an hour, and most of the<br />\nemployers have paid it.\"<br />\nThe work-study program has been a<br />\nspecial boon to the MSE library. By<br />\nincreasing the number of work-study<br />\nemployees for whom they must provide<br />\nonly 20 per cent of the salary, the<br />\nLibrary has saved enough to hire<br />\nnon-work-study employees at the same<br />\nrate as their counterparts on financial aid.<br />\n<br />\nafter two evaluations, was granted a little<br />\nover $2 million.<br />\nHood said the $3 million increase in<br />\nthis year's request stems from the hike in<br />\ntuition and living expenses.<br />\nLion's Share<br />\nTraditionally, Arts and Sciences<br />\nstudents receive \"the lion's share\" of the<br />\naid. Hood attributes this \"to the fact that<br />\nwe probably have more eligible students<br />\namong the undergraduates here at<br />\nHomewood. Also Arts and Sciences uses<br />\nall three aid programs while the other<br />\ndivisions'may not.\"<br />\nIn contrast to last year, when Hood<br />\nworked to enlarge the work-study<br />\nprogram, the Financial Aid Directory is<br />\nnow trying to increase NDS loans.<br />\n\"Dollar for dollar these loans are the<br />\nbest deal for students,\" Hood stated.<br />\nHe said that although the federal<br />\ngovernment is considering doing away<br />\nwith these loans due to their high default<br />\n<br />\nBerger dead at 37<br />\n<br />\n*********<br />\nThe News-Letter is looking for *<br />\n<br />\n***********<br />\n<br />\nDr. Hillard Berger, Associate Professor<br />\nof Biology, died early Tuesday morning<br />\nof a heart attack while undergoing<br />\ntreatment for a kidney malfunction at the<br />\nHopkins Hospital.<br />\nBerger, a diabetic, suffered the attack<br />\nsoon after he was put on a dialysis<br />\nmachine for treatment.<br />\nBerger, 37, came to Hopkins in 1967<br />\nafter attending UCLA as an<br />\nundergraduate and Vanderbilt for his<br />\ngraduate studies.

As witnessed in Lee Pilz's<br />\n\u2022 course \"Contemporary Humor\",<br />\nquestioning of a teacher's precepts is fully<br />\naccepted. After reading a particularly<br />\ntedious example of H. Allen Smith's<br />\nhumor, which apparently only Pilz found<br />\ncomic, a short but particularly heavy<br />\nsilence followed. Soon one student<br />\ndemanded, \"Did you really think that<br />\nwas funny?\" Pilz took the comment-with<br />\ngood grace which led to a perceptive<br />\n-analysis of the piece by the group.<br />\nThe students enrolled in these courses<br />\ncome from a diversity of backgrounds<br />\nand education. Generally each class is<br />\ncomposed of one or two Hopkins<br />\nstudents, a few people who are employed<br />\nin the area, several housewives and some<br />\nideal dates for the hearing of bills, and<br />\nunemployed people.

Both squads, however, had<br />\nexcellent opportunities to score, but solid<br />\ndefense and steady goaltending at each<br />\nend of the field combined to keep the<br />\n<br />\nninety minutes of the finest brand of<br />\nsoccer that exists.<br />\nAnd, when the final horn had sounded,<br />\nthe Blue Jays had captured their biggest<br />\nvictory of the season\u2014a stunning 1-0<br />\ndecision over the Loyola Greyhounds.<br />\nThe contest turned out to be all it was<br />\nearmarked as: an evening of intense<br />\nsoccer.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were 7-1-1 (\"...the best<br />\nkept soccer secret in town...\" according<br />\nto the Evening Sun's Phil Hersh) going<br />\ninto the battle and were coming off<br />\nMonday night's big 4-2 win over UMBC.<br />\nLoyola, 9-2 and ranked third<br />\nnationally in the Division ll soccer polls<br />\nbefore the game, had spent their Monday<br />\nafternoon impressively defeating<br />\npreviously unbeaten Philadelphia Textile,<br />\nthe number three team in the nation in<br />\nDivision I, by the count of 3-1.<br />\n<br />\ngame scoreless after forty-five minutes of<br />\naction.<br />\nThe halftime statistics seem to bear<br />\nthis point out. Through the first half, the<br />\nGreyhounds had taken ten shots to the<br />\nBlue Jays' seven while the goalies had<br />\nrecorded only one save apiece.<br />\nThe pace began to pick up<br />\nconsiderably in the second half. Both<br />\nteams had many chances to put the ball<br />\npast the opposing netkeeper, but the<br />\ndefenses held strong.<br />\nAs the game clock moved under the<br />\nten-minute mark, the possibility of<br />\novertime began to occupy many minds.<br />\nSuddenly, however, lightning, in the form<br />\nof Hopkins forward Greg Cunningham,<br />\nstruck.<br />\nA Loyola defender found himself with<br />\nthe ball after a scramble near the<br />\nGreyhound net and attempted to kick the<br />\n<br />\nRifle Team prepares for<br />\naction-packed season<br />\nBy BETH TERRANOVA<br />\nAs the smoke cleared on the rifle range<br />\nlast week, the members of the 1975-76<br />\nJohns Hopkins Varsity Rifle Team came<br />\ninto view. The team overcame several<br />\nobstacles to end up with the largest<br />\nmembership in over 5 years. Returning<br />\nmembers captured the top five spots in<br />\nthe shoot -offs with Sukon<br />\nKanchanaraksa's 246 leading the scoring.<br />\nFollowing were Glenn Horner (236), Jeff<br />\nBooher (222), John Laczin (221), and<br />\nBeth Terranova (216). Filling out the top<br />\nten are new members Don Gerhart, Bob<br />\nAlbin, Mike Hearn, Glenn Stewart, and<br />\nTony Moss. These ten shooters have<br />\nqualified to participate in the team's first<br />\nmatch today against Dickinson at home.<br />\nProblems<br />\n\"Considering all our problems, I'm<br />\nreally surprised that so many managed to<br />\nstay interested,\" said one returning<br />\nmember. \"Problems\" included the fact<br />\nthat until a couple weeks ago, the 20 or<br />\nso people trying out had to share 5 rifles,<br />\nincluding some privately owned weapons.<br />\nThe reason for this is that most of the<br />\nteam's weapons are owned by the JHU<br />\nROTC, and were at Fort Meade for<br />\nmaintenance. In the meantime, those<br />\nwishing to shoot had to use whatever rifle<br />\nwas available, adjusting equipment and<br />\nsights each time.<br />\nTeam captain Horner explained<br />\nfurther: \"Each individual sights in<br />\ndifferently. When you're using the same<br />\nweapon all the time, you'll have to make<br />\nvery few changes once it's been sighted<br />\nin. But when you're always changing<br />\n<br />\nweapons, you can spend half your time<br />\njust trying to get your sight picture<br />\ncorrect.\"<br />\nThe size of the team generated other<br />\nproblems. For the first time practice<br />\nhours had to be assigned to ensure that<br />\neveryone who wanted to could get a<br />\nchance to shoot. The result was that no<br />\none really had enough time to practice.<br />\nJohn Laczin summed it up: \"Constant<br />\nand consistent practice is the most<br />\nimportant thing in riflery, as in any sport.<br />\nIt's just difficult to shoot well when<br />\nyou're only allowed a couple hours on<br />\none day each week to do it.\"<br />\nFinally, the large number of \"recruits\"<br />\nnecessitated the use of returning members<br />\nas instructors, cutting even further into<br />\ntheir practice time. \"It's probably the<br />\nbiggest reason for the low scores,\"<br />\ncommented Jeff Booher.<br />\nThe team's new coach, Captain James<br />\nPhillips, was pleased with the large<br />\nturnout for the team, and especially glad<br />\nto see women coming out. The JHU Rifle<br />\nTeam \\ was the first co-ed sport on<br />\ncampus, and the first to award varsity<br />\nawards to women, and this year saw a<br />\ndefinite pick-up in interest among<br />\nHopkins women.<br />\n\"In general, I think the team looks<br />\ngood,\" said Horner. \"In the first few<br />\nweeks there've been a lot of good scores,<br />\nespecially by new members, and there's<br />\nbeen a lot of potential shown. It's hard to<br />\nmake a season prediction at this point<br />\nsince we don't know much about the<br />\nother teams, but I think we have a really<br />\ngood chance for another winning season.\"<br />\n<br />\nball back to his goalie.

That power<br />\nlies with the athletic department.\"<br />\nIn closing, the coach commented that<br />\n\"...the whole world can't be wrong<br />\n(about soccer).

For about a decade, New York<br />\ndevoted a full square mile on Welfare<br />\nIsland to housing towed cars, so large<br />\nwere the daily heists. Not only did the<br />\ntraffic congestion get better, but the city<br />\nwas able to avert God knows how many<br />\nbudget deficits\u2014all due to the towing<br />\nbusiness.<br />\nOther cities took the cue therefrom<br />\nand,by that process we call specialization,<br />\nmade the penalty of towing an effective<br />\nand fear-inspiring caveat. In metropolises<br />\nthe world over, motorists avoid<br />\n\"Tow-Away Zones\" like the plague.<br />\nMy own experience with the brigands<br />\nof the Baltimore Police Department was<br />\nonly partially my fault. True, I had made<br />\nit a practice of allowing the rear end of<br />\nmy 1971 gold Vega to protrude two or<br />\nthree feet beyond the legal boundary on<br />\nArt Museum Drive\u2014a discreet violation in<br />\nmy view. But in the last analysis, it was<br />\nthe computer that got me.<br />\nLike every other student motorist I<br />\nknow, I accepted as gospel the fact that<br />\nyou just don't pay out of state parking<br />\nviolations. The states don't<br />\nreciprocate\u2014everybody knows that.<br />\nThose Jersey plates were a free pass<br />\nthrough the insufferable tedium of petty<br />\nlocal parking tickets\u2014or so I thought.<br />\nLike any astute out of state driver, I<br />\nhad accumulated my fair share of<br />\noutdated parking fines, the thought never<br />\nentering my mind that I would someday<br />\nbe forced to pay for all of them. The<br />\npolice would no sooner enforce back<br />\nviolations than they would rage through<br />\nthe Charles Village arresting/ every soul<br />\nwith a fleck of marijuana on his person.<br />\nYou just don't do that.<br />\nBut the Baltimore Police Department<br />\nhas ushered in a new era in parking<br />\nviolations\u2014the end of innocence,<br />\ncourtesy of their new computer: a<br />\nleviathan IBM (takes up to one-third of<br />\nthe new central headquarters downtown,<br />\naccording to one of the many policemen I<br />\nwas to encounter) which can conduct<br />\nnationwide scans of motor vehicles<br />\nbureaus at a moment's notice. I was, I<br />\nsuspect, one of its first victims.<br />\nWhile walking through campus one<br />\nmorning last week discussing with a<br />\nfriend our impending intersession<br />\nexcursion to Mexico, I was accosted<br />\nby a breathless colleague: \"Hurry up,<br />\nthey're towing your car.\" I sprinted down<br />\nto Art Museum Drive to find the car<br />\nsuspended from the maw of a large<br />\norange towing rig, a small crowd of<br />\ncurious passers-by watching as one Officer<br />\nC.L. Rummel affixed a parking citation<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nto the windshield.<br />\n\"Excuse me,\" I interjected. \"That's my<br />\ncar.\"<br />\n\"Nope. Mine now,\" replied the officer.<br />\n\"How come?\"<br />\n\"Son,you've got a $117 due on this<br />\ncar,\" Rummel explained, pulling out a<br />\nyellow print-out cataloguing a surfeit of<br />\nback violations next to my license plate<br />\nnumber. A new computer, he said, was<br />\nhelping police track down out of state<br />\nviolators.<br />\nAbove my protestations, Rummel<br />\ninsisted that the car would have to be<br />\ntowed\u2014impounded really\u2014until the<br />\nviolations were paid for. As the tow truck<br />\npulled down Charles Street and out of<br />\nsight, friends and passers-by alike were<br /><br />\nlaughing, behind their rueful faces of<br />\naffected concern, at the total abjectness<br />\nof my situation. They were taking my<br />\ncar\u2014and I couldn't do anything about it.<br />\nOfficer Rummel, however, acquitted<br />\nhimself like a true servant of the public,<br />\ntabulating each and every back fine for<br />\nmy benefit, and giving me the address of<br />\nthe site of incarceration, and the parking<br />\nfine office. The final figure I owed,<br />\ntowing and storage charges included, was<br />\na staggering $117.<br />\nHow to raise such a sum? I knew for<br />\ncertain that all of the myriad fines<br />\nweren't my own\u2014I had always been<br />\nliberal in lending out my car. So I decided<br />\nthat the taxman would have to cometh to<br />\nthe houses of a few of the more frequent<br /><br />\nborrowers of the vehicle.

For the<br />\naddress of the parking fine office-200<br />\nNorth Holiday Street\u2014had made me<br />\nwary, as I was familiar enough with<br />\ndowntown Baltimore to know that the<br />\nstreet names lose their significance once<br />\none \u2022 gets to those low numbers.

No hassle<br />\nwhatsoever in paying up my parking<br />\ntickets and accrued late fines\u2014the people<br />\nwere all too happy to accept my money.<br />\nI was advised to get over to the impound<br />\nlot on the harbor and pay the towing fine<br />\nwith dispatch, since the vehicle would<br />\nonly be held there for three days.<br />\nWhether the car would be thrown into<br />\nthe harbor at the end of that period, theY<br />\nwould not specify.<br />\nLikewise at the impound lot, the<br />\ncashier was gratified to accept my check,<br />\ntreating us to four ritual<br />\nmispronunciations of our grand<br />\ninstitution's name as she perused mY<br />\nHopkins ID.<br />\nThe dues paid, we got into the car and<br />\nembarked on the short sojourn up Charles<br />\nStreet.

Kilpatrick in<br />\nWashington.<br /><br />\nWomen's strike provokes some new awareness<br />\nBy D.H. WARREN<br />\nhad just finished reading about<br />\nWomen's Strike Day and scratched my<br />\nbeard a few times, pretending to give the<br />\nWhole subject serious consideration. This<br />\nwas supposed to be a national event, and<br />\neven though I try to shut myself off from<br />\nthe humdrum day-to-day problems by<br />\nnot watching television or reading daily<br />\npapers, I wondered how it was going to<br />\naffect me, not to mention the Hop, which<br />\nisn't the kind of place where you expect<br />\nStrikes or protests or revolutionary<br />\nthinking. No, we're all too caught up in<br />\nthat \"pre-professional hysteria.\" Nothing<br />\nlike it to make you forget about starving<br />\nPeople, crooked politicians, higher prices,<br />\nand all the rest of the garbage that<br />\noccupies family dinner tables. Yes, there<br />\nare some advantages to being concerned<br />\nWith no one's future but your own.<br />\nHowever, I digress.<br />\nSupposedly, women were even going to<br />\nextend their strike to their activity in<br />\n-bed. Now, that's intense. I wondered if<br />\nLayla was going to go that far. Neither of<br />\nus had ever forced sex on the other if he<br />\nor she did not want to. And even though<br />\nmost of my so-called \"male<br />\nbrothers\"\u2014and for that matter, the<br />\nfemales,too\u2014 won't admit it, men aren't<br />\nalways horny. At the Hop, anybody will<br />\ntell you that if the girls didn't take any<br />\ninitiative, the boys would still be sitting<br />\naround bitching how Hopkins females<br />\nnever \u2022 want to go out. Let's face it, the<br />\nAmerican male is basically a very neurotic<br />\ncreature who has been raised with the<br />\nmyth that he is superior, and when he<br />\ndiscovers that it ain't necessarily so, he<br />\nbecomes a shattered ego with terminal<br />\nimpotence. But I digress.<br />\nWhen I got up the' next morning,<br />\ncuriosity was on my mind. What was<br />\nWomen's Strike Day going to be like?<br />\nWould there be a lot of feminist bullshit<br />\nfollowed by even worse male bullshit in<br />\nmy classes? Or would the women just not<br />\ngo to classes, while men made sly remarks<br />\nabout their sex lives? I wondered, and<br />\nwas beginning to really think about it all.<br />\nMy Morning class had all the women<br />\nthere. Some small talk went around the<br />\ncar about the Strike (we were on, a field<br />\ntrip) and the women didn't seem very<br />\nimpressed by the whole thing. I figured<br />\nthey're the kind of people who have<br />\nalready found their sexual identity and<br />\nnow have more important things on their<br />\nminds. They're distinct individuals who<br /><br />\nwon't be molded to something called<br />\n\"men's values\" or any other type of<br />\nthinking that no longer treats them as<br />\nindividuals. I was impressed. A woman<br />\nis a category. A person is something real.<br />\nOne , of the guys in the class<br />\nmentioned that there was a group of<br />\nwomen in New York City who were<br />\npurposely going to fix their husbands'<br />\nfavorite meals, and be extra nice to<br />\nhubby. I don't believe in marriage, at<br />\nleast not for me. Every time I read<br />\n\"Rope,\" by Katherine Anne Porter, I'm<br />\nconvinced that I am correct. But perhaps<br />\nthat was how Chose women in New York<br />\nfound their sexual identity. I felt sorry<br />\nfor them.<br />\nThat afternoon at the grocery store, I<br />\nnoticed several mothers busily shopping<br />\nand taking care of their young children. I<br /><br />\nsuppose they didn't have time to strike. It<br />\nwould have to be put off until the kids<br />\ngraduated from college. I had to respect<br />\nthem. I gave my parents hell when I was<br />\ngrowing up. That's probably why I don't<br />\nlook forward to having any children.<br />\nSome people have got to be parents<br />\nthough, especially if I want another<br />\ngeneration of readers. There's a situation<br />\nthat definitely needs improvement. Men<br />\nhave got to do more than just start the<br />\nbabies. I decided I was 100 per cent pro<br />\nmale pregnancies. Once again, though, I<br />\ndigress.<br />\nThere were some unescorted males<br />\nshopping at the grocery store, also. I<br />\nwondered if they were husbands of<br />\nmilitant wives who had been sent to the<br />\nstore. Or maybe they were just spouses<br />\nwho saw nothing wrong With helping out<br /><br />\nand always did the groceries. More than<br />\nlikely, however, they were bachelors, who<br />\nknew that if they didn't feed<br />\nthemselves, who would? Jeez, the grocery<br />\nstore is the great equalizer of life.<br />\nThat night I saw Layla and asked her<br />\nwhat she had done for Women's Strike<br />\nDay. She looked at me very seriously, and<br />\nthen Suddenly burst out into fits of<br />\nlaughter. You silly, she said, I was just<br />\nmyself today, because that's what it was<br />\nall about.<br />\nYou've got to find yourself first, I<br />\nreminded her.<br />\nYes, she said knowingly, and once<br />\nyou've found yourself, you can't let<br />\nanybody take it away from you.<br />\n- But how could they, if you don't (et<br />\nthem?<br />\n\u2014<br />\nPrecisely.<br /><br />\nHearts of the West: well, not really<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\nIf Hearts of the West, billed as \"MGM's<br />\nComedy Surprise,\" is a comedy, then it's<br />\nsurprise to me, not because the movie is a<br />\nfailure, but because of the usual<br />\nmisleading Hollywood publicity.

Arkin plays Kessler so<br />\nintensely his performance is funny and<br />\nsucceeds quite well. He's exactly the son<br />\nof a bitch we expect.<br />\nBlythe Danner plays Trout, Kessler<br />\nscript girl. Trout is the kind of girl you<br />\nwould imagine to be working in<br />\nHollywood at the time, the early thirties.<br />\nShe's cynical and tough but still an<br />\noutsider (the only female in an all-male<br />\nproduction company) trying to wise up<br />\nthe young inexperience here, later.<br />\nBlythe Danner's performance invokes the<br />\nghosts of Jean Arthur trying to initiate<br />\nJimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper in \"Mr.<br />\nSmith Goes to Washington'. and \"Mr.<br />\nDeeds Goes to Town,\" two of the most<br />\npopular movies of the decade.<br />\nFather-Figure<br />\nAs Howard Pike, an aging cowboy<br />\nactor, Andy Griffith shows for the first<br />\ntime in a long while that he is a very<br />\ncapable actor.

The film centers on Lewis'<br />\nrealization of the truth about Western<br />\nmyths.

In the ghetto<br />\nsome fathers do stay drunk all day and<br />\nvent years of frustrations by beating kids.<br />\nSome mothers do leave six-year-olds in<br />\ncharge of sisters and brothers for an<br />\nentire working day.

Just a chance for their kids to<br />\npull themselves up by President Ford's<br />\n\"bootstraps.\" A solid community can<br />\nmake it work. There are such<br />\ncommunities in Baltimore.<br />\nThe'elementary schools, the only forte<br />\nof the Baltimore public school system,<br />\nwork to some extent. Little racial strife;<br />\nfew problems with forced integration,<br />\nand a lot of learning. Positive beginnings<br />\nfor most kids entering school. They offer<br />\na basic standardized curriculum aimed<br />\n\u2022<br />\nslightly above the capabilities of the<br />\naverage student. Challenge is present:<br />\ncertainly not up to par with that at a first<br />\nrate county school, but an important<br />\nstimulative factor. However, as talented<br />\nand enthusiastic as any teacher might be,<br />\nthere are severe limitations. Large classes,<br />\npoor or nonexistent supplies, discipline<br />\nand motivational problems bog the<br />\nsystem down. Students aren't even<br />\nallowed to take textbooks home in many<br />\ninstances, aren't encouraged to learn<br />\noutside of class. Obviously an alternative<br />\nto augment and reinforce this struggling<br />\nsystem is necessary and does presently<br />\nexist on a limited scale. There is a<br />\nprogram in which over a hundred and<br />\nfifty elementary schoolchildren, from<br />\nthree radically different neighborhoods,<br />\nare individually \"tutored\"- by local high<br />\nschool and college students. It's run by<br />\nthe Office of the Chaplain, and it's the<br />\nlargest of its kind in Baltimore. It is<br />\ninvaluable to the kids participating and to<br />\nthe community they come from: the<br />\nghettos of Baltimore.<br />\nThree well-defined geographical areas<br />\nare involved: Northwest (Fulton and<br />\nCalhoun Streets), Southwest (Franklin<br />\nSt.), and Eastern (Broadway and Hopkins<br />\nHospital). The make-up of the<br /><br />\nneighborhoods vary, some all black, some<br />\na mixture. But the kids have two things in<br />\ncommon: they all are impoverished and<br />\nthey are willing to spend two afternoons<br />\na week at Hopkins, supplementing their<br />\neducation\u2014academic and social.<br />\nMy encounter with this network has<br />\nbeen. as a tutor through the Calhoun<br />\nStreet Community Center. Immediately<br />\nyou'll notice a poor black neighborhood,<br />\ndrunks sleeping on doorsteps, and<br />\ncolorful .murals on tenement walls. Hope<br />\nand desperation side by side. An<br />\nuncomfortable feeling will accompany<br />\nyour introduction to the type of<br />\ncommunity where 70 per cent of<br />\nBaltimore's blacks live. It is threatening in<br />\na pathetic way.<br />\nThe Calhoun Center is kids. Two<br />\nafternoons a week it's teemir.g with kids.<br />\nThe Center is a stalwart remnant from the<br />\nWar on Poverty, that was publicized<br />\nextensively in the mid and late sixties.<br />\nFederal budget cuts have eliminated two<br />\nthirds of the total number of centers. Not<br />\nsurprisingly, all of the centers that were<br />\nconnected with the Hopkins tutoring<br />\nprogram remained open. Someone<br />\nsomewhere determined that these were<br />\nthe centers most valuable to the<br />\ncomm unity.<br />\nThe community knows about the<br />\nHopkins tutoring program. People are<br />\nrecognized on the street and are<br /><br />\nappreciated and in a certain sense<br />\nsheltered. The word has spread very<br />\nquickly along the local grapevine. No<br />\npublicity is necessary, -the good word<br />\nspreads from brother to sister to cousin.<br />\nThe program\u2014an all-volunteer project\u2014is<br />\njust able to cope with the numbers<br />\npresently involved.<br />\nThat isn't the whole story of course; in<br />\na metropolitan area this large there are<br />\nmore than a hundred and fifty kids who<br />\ndesire and need the attention. There. are<br />\nonly 50 kids waiting on the community<br />\ncenter lists, hut the word has spread.<br /><br />\nCity-wide, there is a mounting backlog of<br />\nover 400.<br />\nIt has taken more than ten years to<br />\nplant this tentative seed. It finally seems<br />\nto be nourishing itself, propagating, and<br />\n_even spreading. It's time to graduallY<br />\nreturn control and responsibility to the<br />\ncommunities themselves. The numbers<br />\nhave exceeded our meager capabilities.<br />\nThere are adults and older children who<br />\nfeel the need, and have the basic<br />\nknowledge necessary to inspire, motivate,<br />\nand uplift. Future Angelos need to know<br />\nthe details.<br /><br />\nWhere's Ron<br /><br />\nMingling and Explicating in T&amp;S<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nLike I was telling Willy, it sure was<br />\nlucky that I checked my mailbox<br />\nyesterday. It was an afterthought, I<br />\nadmit, checking the box, but the letter<br />\nfrom the English Department, stuffed<br />\nbetween old Barnstormer solicitations<br />\nand Student Council \"progress reports,\"<br />\nconfirmed a belief I'll always hang onto:<br />\nbig things come in small packages.<br />\nIt wasn't that I hadn't expected good<br />\nnews from the English Department, but<br />\nthe invite to the Tudor and Stuart Room<br />\nfor an informal, but one could be sure<br />\ntasteful, gathering of the forty English<br />\nmajors at Hopkins took me by surprise.<br />\nImagine, I thought, the entire English<br />\nDepartment rallying together for a real<br />\nevent, everyone invited, undergraduates<br />\ntoo! The lunchroom was abuzz with<br />\nrumors that last year's chairman, Ronald<br />\nPaulson would be in attendance, possibly<br />\nto read from his upcoming work, Hogarth<br />\nand Norman Mader: Beyond the Grave<br />\nand Across the Centuries.<br />\nInvitation in hand, I approached the<br /><br />\nmusty Victorian confines of the Tudor<br />\nand Stuart Room, ready to mingle and<br />\nexplicate, for a shabby affair this could<br />\nnot be. Entering the room, I was received<br />\nby the current chairman, someone who<br />\nisn't exactly a household word but who is<br />\nknown in literary circles. He was all<br />\nsmiles as he scarfed down Utz thin<br />\npretzels with one hand, while clutching a<br />\ncan of National Boh in the other. All<br />\nright, I say to myself, so it's not a wine<br />\nand cheese affair. That kind of party is<br />\nprobably dated by now anyway.<br />\nBut if the refreshments were less than<br />\nfitting, the company was fine. Scattered<br />\namong the approximately fifteen<br />\nstudents, were not only the blood and<br />\nguts of tomorrow's English Department,<br />\nthe Fergusons, the Michaels, the Wellers,<br />\nbut smor faculty members as well. The<br />\nprofessors seemed in jubilant spirits as<br />\nthey introduced themselves to new faces,<br />\npointing with a smile of camaraderie to<br />\nthe six-packs of beer and bags of cheetos<br />\non the oak table.<br />\nThe conversation never lagged.<br /><br />\nStudents, quickly gravitated towards their<br />\nfavorite prof, in hopes of netting nuggets<br />\nabout graduate school, and the other<br />\nsteps on the ladder to an English<br />\nprofessorship. I heard one especially<br />\nstimulating exchange between a student<br />\nand one of the professors. It only lasted a<br />\ncouple of minutes, but what they packed<br />\nin there, could take a lifetime to study.<br />\nStarting with recitations in Old English of<br />\nChaucer's Canterbury Tales, the duo<br />\ndiscussed the pros and cons of Dickens'<br />\nlater novels, Byron vs. Shelley, and<br />\nwhether Robinson Crusoe is really the<br />\nfirst English Novel. From the last<br />\nquestion, heated words were almost<br />\nsprung, if not for the cool of another<br />\nprofessor, who hushed the matter with an<br />\nappropriate quote from Browning.<br />\nSadly, after almost two hours, it was<br />\ntime to leave. We all agreed that we'd get<br />\ntogether more often. It had worked out<br />\nso well, and not one student's smile faded<br />\nwhen one of the professors waved<br />\ngoodbye and said, \"It's been great, see<br />\nyou next year.\"<br /><br />\noctoher 31, 1975/-tews-letter/page 5<br />\n4E06MA YAMSMSXIS3<br /><br />\n=iflagXSAORSMS<br /><br />\nMOSIKOZIME<br /><br />\nMSNAM<br /><br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br />\n\"THE SUNDAY EXPERIENCE\"<br />\nGLOBAL HUNGER<br />\nwith<br />\nDAVID BURGESS<br />\nSenior Officer, UNICEF<br />\nUNITED NATIONS<br />\nSUNDAY, NOVEMBER 2,11:00 A.M.<br />\nLISTENING-VIEWING ROOM<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br /><br />\nA delicious Sirloin Steak<br />\nplus<br />\ngolden brown French Fries<br />\nplus<br />\n1 frosty pitcher of beer<br />\nplus<br />\nall the salad you want to make.<br /><br />\n11.10111411030:3201163146,MXISPASKINSINSIXAMIXISIXOWS310.11MiSi N<br />\nINFO &amp; PHONE CHARGES: CALL (301) 363-0800<br /><br />\nFRANKIE<br />\nVALLI &amp;<br />\n.FOIIR<br />\nSEASONS<br /><br />\nSteak, pitcher of beer and more.

But we<br />\nhad suggested upping work-study wages<br />\nto $2.75 an hour, and most of the<br />\nemployers have paid it.\"<br />\nThe work-study program has been a<br />\nspecial boon to the MSE library. By<br />\nincreasing the number of work-study<br />\nemployees for whom they must provide<br />\nonly 20 per cent of the salary, the<br />\nLibrary has saved enough to hire<br />\nnon-work-study employees at the same<br />\nrate as their counterparts on financial aid.<br /><br />\nafter two evaluations, was granted a little<br />\nover $2 million.<br />\nHood said the $3 million increase in<br />\nthis year's request stems from the hike in<br />\ntuition and living expenses.<br />\nLion's Share<br />\nTraditionally, Arts and Sciences<br />\nstudents receive \"the lion's share\" of the<br />\naid.

As witnessed in Lee Pilz's<br />\n\u2022 course \"Contemporary Humor\",<br />\nquestioning of a teacher's precepts is fully<br />\naccepted. After reading a particularly<br />\ntedious example of H. Allen Smith's<br />\nhumor, which apparently only Pilz found<br />\ncomic, a short but particularly heavy<br />\nsilence followed. Soon one student<br />\ndemanded, \"Did you really think that<br />\nwas funny?\" Pilz took the comment-with<br />\ngood grace which led to a perceptive<br />\n-analysis of the piece by the group.<br />\nThe students enrolled in these courses<br />\ncome from a diversity of backgrounds<br />\nand education. Generally each class is<br />\ncomposed of one or two Hopkins<br />\nstudents, a few people who are employed<br />\nin the area, several housewives and some<br />\nideal dates for the hearing of bills, and<br />\nunemployed people. This diversity<br />\nactively sought supporters for them. He<br />\nprovides not only a broadening of the<br />\nalso worked on making funds available<br />\nclass's views but a welcome challenge to<br />\nfor the preservation of historic buildings<br />\nin Maryland, which involved close work<br />\nthe teacher's concepts.

In discussing attempts to<br />\ncurb the proletariat's short term interests<br />\nto enable the achievement of long-range<br />\ngoals, one student detailed his summer<br />\nexperience in which the workers in his<br />\nfactory attempted to unionize.

And to a large. extent the '<br />\nstudents study these readings because it<br />\nprovides them with more material to<br />\nshare with their classes.

Both squads, however, had<br />\nexcellent opportunities to score, but solid<br />\ndefense and steady goaltending at each<br />\nend of the field combined to keep the<br /><br />\nninety minutes of the finest brand of<br />\nsoccer that exists.<br />\nAnd, when the final horn had sounded,<br />\nthe Blue Jays had captured their biggest<br />\nvictory of the season\u2014a stunning 1-0<br />\ndecision over the Loyola Greyhounds.<br />\nThe contest turned out to be all it was<br />\nearmarked as: an evening of intense<br />\nsoccer.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were 7-1-1 (\"...the best<br />\nkept soccer secret in town...\" according<br />\nto the Evening Sun's Phil Hersh) going<br />\ninto the battle and were coming off<br />\nMonday night's big 4-2 win over UMBC.<br />\nLoyola, 9-2 and ranked third<br />\nnationally in the Division ll soccer polls<br />\nbefore the game, had spent their Monday<br />\nafternoon impressively defeating<br />\npreviously unbeaten Philadelphia Textile,<br />\nthe number three team in the nation in<br />\nDivision I, by the count of 3-1.<br /><br />\ngame scoreless after forty-five minutes of<br />\naction.<br />\nThe halftime statistics seem to bear<br />\nthis point out. Through the first half, the<br />\nGreyhounds had taken ten shots to the<br />\nBlue Jays' seven while the goalies had<br />\nrecorded only one save apiece.<br />\nThe pace began to pick up<br />\nconsiderably in the second half. Both<br />\nteams had many chances to put the ball<br />\npast the opposing netkeeper, but the<br />\ndefenses held strong.<br />\nAs the game clock moved under the<br />\nten-minute mark, the possibility of<br />\novertime began to occupy many minds.<br />\nSuddenly, however, lightning, in the form<br />\nof Hopkins forward Greg Cunningham,<br />\nstruck.<br />\nA Loyola defender found himself with<br />\nthe ball after a scramble near the<br />\nGreyhound net and attempted to kick the<br /><br />\nRifle Team prepares for<br />\naction-packed season<br />\nBy BETH TERRANOVA<br />\nAs the smoke cleared on the rifle range<br />\nlast week, the members of the 1975-76<br />\nJohns Hopkins Varsity Rifle Team came<br />\ninto view. The team overcame several<br />\nobstacles to end up with the largest<br />\nmembership in over 5 years. Returning<br />\nmembers captured the top five spots in<br />\nthe shoot -offs with Sukon<br />\nKanchanaraksa's 246 leading the scoring.<br />\nFollowing were Glenn Horner (236), Jeff<br />\nBooher (222), John Laczin (221), and<br />\nBeth Terranova (216). Filling out the top<br />\nten are new members Don Gerhart, Bob<br />\nAlbin, Mike Hearn, Glenn Stewart, and<br />\nTony Moss. These ten shooters have<br />\nqualified to participate in the team's first<br />\nmatch today against Dickinson at home.<br />\nProblems<br />\n\"Considering all our problems, I'm<br />\nreally surprised that so many managed to<br />\nstay interested,\" said one returning<br />\nmember. \"Problems\" included the fact<br />\nthat until a couple weeks ago, the 20 or<br />\nso people trying out had to share 5 rifles,<br />\nincluding some privately owned weapons.<br />\nThe reason for this is that most of the<br />\nteam's weapons are owned by the JHU<br />\nROTC, and were at Fort Meade for<br />\nmaintenance. In the meantime, those<br />\nwishing to shoot had to use whatever rifle<br />\nwas available, adjusting equipment and<br />\nsights each time.<br />\nTeam captain Horner explained<br />\nfurther: \"Each individual sights in<br />\ndifferently. When you're using the same<br />\nweapon all the time, you'll have to make<br />\nvery few changes once it's been sighted<br />\nin. But when you're always changing<br /><br />\nweapons, you can spend half your time<br />\njust trying to get your sight picture<br />\ncorrect.\"<br />\nThe size of the team generated other<br />\nproblems. For the first time practice<br />\nhours had to be assigned to ensure that<br />\neveryone who wanted to could get a<br />\nchance to shoot. The result was that no<br />\none really had enough time to practice.<br />\nJohn Laczin summed it up: \"Constant<br />\nand consistent practice is the most<br />\nimportant thing in riflery, as in any sport.<br />\nIt's just difficult to shoot well when<br />\nyou're only allowed a couple hours on<br />\none day each week to do it.\"<br />\nFinally, the large number of \"recruits\"<br />\nnecessitated the use of returning members<br />\nas instructors, cutting even further into<br />\ntheir practice time. \"It's probably the<br />\nbiggest reason for the low scores,\"<br />\ncommented Jeff Booher.<br />\nThe team's new coach, Captain James<br />\nPhillips, was pleased with the large<br />\nturnout for the team, and especially glad<br />\nto see women coming out. The JHU Rifle<br />\nTeam \\ was the first co-ed sport on<br />\ncampus, and the first to award varsity<br />\nawards to women, and this year saw a<br />\ndefinite pick-up in interest among<br />\nHopkins women.<br />\n\"In general, I think the team looks<br />\ngood,\" said Horner. \"In the first few<br />\nweeks there've been a lot of good scores,<br />\nespecially by new members, and there's<br />\nbeen a lot of potential shown. It's hard to<br />\nmake a season prediction at this point<br />\nsince we don't know much about the<br />\nother teams, but I think we have a really<br />\ngood chance for another winning season.\"<br /><br />\nball back to his goalie. However, this pass<br />\nwent astray and Cunningham gathered up<br />\nthe loose ball and fired it into an<br />\nunoccupied net with just seven and a half<br />\nminutes remaining in the game.<br />\nThe final minutes of the game seemed<br />\nlike an eternity to the Hopkins faithful.<br />\nThe Greyhounds mounted a full-scale<br />\nattack against the Blue Jays defense in a<br />\nfutile search for the tying goal.<br />\nBut the Homewood back-line, led by<br />\nfullbacks Lou Podrazik and Frank<br />\nOlszewski and netminder Ken Seusse,<br />\nproved more than equal to their<br />\nappointed task. Time after time, they<br />\nused combinations of legs, thighs, heads<br />\nand goalie's hands to stop the Loyola<br />\noffensive barrage.<br />\nAnd, as the clock finally wound down,<br />\na feeling of complete joy enveloped the<br />\nHopkins side of the field. As the defeated<br />\nGreyhounds trudged slowly off the field,<br />\nan ecstatic combination of Blue Jay<br />\nplayers, coaches and fans gathered on the<br />\nfield to celebrate their team's finest<br />\nmoment.<br />\nThe scene in the victor's locker room<br />\nfollowing the game was one of jubilation.<br />\nThe hand-shaking and back-slapping was<br />\ninterrupted only by the arrival of Blue<br />\nJay Coach Bob Oliver, who was given a<br />\nboisterous ovation by his charges.<br />\nLocker room visitors included Athletic<br />\nDirector Bob Scott who commented that<br />\nthe crowd was the \"...biggest we've ever<br />\nhad for a soccer game since I've been<br />\nhere\u2014probably ever.\"<br />\nGoalie Suesse, who recorded his fourth<br />\nshutout of the year, was most<br />\nappreciative of the defense in front of<br />\nhim.<br />\n\"They did great,\" the freshman from<br />\nPatapsco Senior High said. \"They held<br />\nLoyola to very few shots on goal.\"<br />\nLater, after the shouting had subsided<br />\nand most of the players had left, Coach<br />\nOliver had a chance to reflect on the<br />\ncontest.<br />\n\"When you want something that bad,<br />\nyou can get it,\" the coach said. \"That's<br />\nwhat I like about this team\u2014they want<br />\nthem all.\"<br />\nOliver also disclosed that the team had<br />\ndefinite strategies going into the game.<br />\n\"On offense, we wanted to pick on<br />\ntheir wing fullbacks,\" the coach revealed.<br /><br />\n\"Two of their regular starters were out<br />\nwith injuries and we wanted to utilize our<br />\nstrength\u2014the wing forwards\u2014against their<br />\npossible weakness.\"<br />\n\"Defensively, we were watching (Ian I<br />\nReid and [Pete] Notar on their liue.<br />\nNotaro is a real Mr. Hustle; he's all over<br />\nthe field.\"<br />\nThe coach was asked if the game went<br />\npretty much as he had expected.<br />\n\"Yes, I think so,\" the Blue Jay mentor<br />\nnoted. \"I felt the first half would be a<br />\ntime for feeling out the other team.<br />\n\"However, Loyola is notoriously<br />\nknown to be a second half hall club. So,<br /><br />\nwhen it was 0-0 at the half, we knew it<br />\nwould be a brand new ball game.\"<br />\nOliver also likes the idea of playing in<br />\nthe evening.<br />\n\"We've had nothing but positive<br />\ncomments about the night games,\" the<br />\ncoach said. \"I'd love to schedule more,<br />\nbut I don't have that power. That power<br />\nlies with the athletic department.\"<br />\nIn closing, the coach commented that<br />\n\"...the whole world can't be wrong<br />\n(about soccer). This 1-0 game was just as<br />\nexciting as any 45-28 football game that<br />\nyou'll see.\" And he's got over 1500<br />\npeople who can back him up on that!<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Football team<br />\nto face Moravian College<br />\nAttempting to compensate for<br />\nnumerous injuries to their already-thin<br />\nranks and shifting players freely from one<br />\nposition to another, it will be a<br />\n\"souped-up\" Homewood eleven that<br />\ntakes the field Saturday in Bethlehem,<br />\nPennsylvania to oppose the greyhounds<br />\nof Moravian College, in probably the<br />\nmost evenly-matched contest they will<br />\nplay all season.<br />\nRunning backs Jerry Faraino, John<br />\nCoad, and Brett Miles are all expected to<br />\nmiss the game Saturday, in addition to<br />\nlinebacker John Nutting and fullback<br />\nPeter Bussey, both of whom are out for<br />\nthe season.<br />\nChanges<br />\nHopkins coach Dennis Cox has made<br />\n.a number of position changes to help fill<br />\nthe vacated spots and bolster his offense.<br />\n\"Our lack of depth is finally having an<br />\neffect with all the injuries, but we've<br />\ntaught all the players to play more than<br />\none position just in case something like<br />\nthis happened. It won't be the first time<br />\nthey're playing at the position,\" he said.<br />\nNick Fletcher, Doober Aburn, and<br />\nJack Deckelbaum will all get work in the<br /><br />\nfullback slot. Tom Bender has been<br />\nmoved from safety to quarterback, being<br />\nreplaced by Mike Rhodey at safety, and<br />\nformer quarterback Dave Emala has been<br />\nshifted to wingback to utilize his \"good<br />\nhands\" as a receiver. Also, Charles Hauck<br />\nhas been moved from tackle to<br />\nlinebacker.<br />\nPhysically, both teams are almost<br />\nidentical. Neither team is particularly big,<br />\neach boasting their largest linemen at<br />\nonly around 215 pounds, and the player<br />\nweights at each position are similar.<br />\nStatistically, on offense, average total<br />\noffense is within one yard per game, with<br />\nHopkins sporting an edge in rushing and<br />\nMoravian showing an edge in passing.<br />\nThe most substantial difference<br />\nbetween the two combatants has been on<br />\ndefense and this category may prove to<br />\nbe the deciding factor. The Blue Jays,<br />\nwith a 1-3-1 record, have yielded 105<br />\nmore points than they've scored.<br />\nMoravian, 2-2-1 this season, has scored 15<br />\nmore points than it has allowed. In<br />\naddition, the Moravian yards-per-game<br />\nallowance has been 75 yards lower than<br />\nthat of the Blue Jays.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nThe News-Letter reported in Tuesday's<br />\nedition that the small efficiencies in the<br />\nBaltimorean apartment building were furnished<br />\nwith guest beds.
