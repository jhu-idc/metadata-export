Once a part of the<br />\nseason's program, these short plays have been discarded for two years.<br />\nThey furnish candidates with a necessary opportunity to demonstrate<br />\ntheir ability to proper advantage. An attempt to choose new men for<br />\nparts in the annual play without even knowing previously their relative<br />\nhistrionic powers has always seemed rather ridiculous to us. With the<br />\nadded experience which these shorter plays will afford, it is hoped that<br />\nthe Club will direct its choice toward more worthy plays than it has<br />\nseen fit to give in the past few seasons. The realm of pure farce is not<br />\nwithout its attractions, but, on the other hand, there are many other<br />\ntypes of comedy, if it must be comedy, which are more suited to an<br />\nintelligent audience. Repetition soon becomes dull and after three<br />\nyears of revolution, fights and dashing heroes, it is time for the Barnstormers to look to other sources for their annual production.

Monument St.<br /><br />\nMEN.<br /><br />\nTHE BARNSTORMERS<br />\nT is extremely gratifying to learn that the Barnstormers have extended<br />\ntheir activities to include the giving of several plays during the early<br />\npart of the year in which candidates will have an opportunity to develop and exhibit their prowess in dramatics. Once a part of the<br />\nseason's program, these short plays have been discarded for two years.<br />\nThey furnish candidates with a necessary opportunity to demonstrate<br />\ntheir ability to proper advantage. An attempt to choose new men for<br />\nparts in the annual play without even knowing previously their relative<br />\nhistrionic powers has always seemed rather ridiculous to us. With the<br />\nadded experience which these shorter plays will afford, it is hoped that<br />\nthe Club will direct its choice toward more worthy plays than it has<br />\nseen fit to give in the past few seasons. The realm of pure farce is not<br />\nwithout its attractions, but, on the other hand, there are many other<br />\ntypes of comedy, if it must be comedy, which are more suited to an<br />\nintelligent audience. Repetition soon becomes dull and after three<br />\nyears of revolution, fights and dashing heroes, it is time for the Barnstormers to look to other sources for their annual production.

In fact, when the University<br />\nfirst opens in the Fall for registration, all are furnished with the same<br />\nadvantages and equipment; perhaps<br />\na fire-place or an extra window will<br />\ndistinguish a room or two from the<br />\nothers, but as a whole the entries<br />\nare identical in all respects.<br />\nHowever, a few weeks sees a vast<br />\nchange in the appearance of the<br />\nvarious rooms and in each case,<br />\nentirely the result and initiative of<br />\nits inmate. Throughout the year a<br />\nfew chambers remain barren and<br />\ndesolate as the walls of some deserted institution, but the major<br />\npart of them find decorations and<br />\nfixtures to brighten up the total<br />\nblankness. Several, whose bank accounts are slightly more prosperous<br />\nthan the others, have gone to the<br />\nexpense of obtaining elaborate furniture and heavy rugs, but this is<br />\nnot necessary for the desired effect<br />\nalthough it helps considerably.<br />\nMost of the Dormitory roomers<br />\nhave obtained curtains and a picture<br />\nor two to assist in decorating the<br />\ninterior of their domicile; and with<br />\nan occasional raid on the Greenmount furniture stores and Woolworth's they have already succeeded<br />\nin establishing a comfortable auxilary home for their several years'<br />\nstay at the University. Books of all<br /><br />\ndescriptions fill the book-cases of all<br />\nbut the freshmen, who will doubtlessly soon have more than they<br />\nwant, and even the floors are covered with various and sundry rugs<br />\nof as varied origin.<br />\nOnce within the doors of their<br />\ncastle, rushing and banquet seasons<br />\nexcepted, the students are in absolute seclusion and have the opportunity to do a bit of studying if they<br />\nshould chance to feel so inclined.<br />\nThe conditions are more or less<br />\nfavorable for the studious ones and<br />\nattractions that consume one's time<br />\nare few with the exception of the<br />\nCommon's Room where magazines<br />\nand card parties are abundant.<br />\nHowever, if amusement must be<br />\nhad, anything that might be required<br />\ncan easily be found at some section<br />\non Charles Street either above or<br />\nprincipally below the University.<br />\nBut the Dormitory does not take<br />\nthe responsibility of its inmates and<br />\nit automatically assumes that all are<br />\nresponsible for themselves with the<br />\nexception of a few who have read<br />\nabout college before entering it. The<br />\nlatter usually fail to return the next<br />\nterm, however, and the loss is not<br />\ntremendous. The students represent<br />\na large portion of the \"out-of-town\"<br />\nmen and are held together by common ties as can be attested by the<br />\nelection of the freshman class officers last year. They live together,<br />\nconverse with each other, and exchange ideas in a fashion that can<br />\nhardly be duplicated in any group.<br />\nIn fact, the Dormitory students live<br />\nii harmony, victrolas excepted, in<br />\nan intimate community of their own<br />\nand form many friendships that last<br />\neven after the expiration of their<br />\ndays at the University.<br /><br />\nIT requires trained experts<br />\nwith wide experience and specialized knowledge to determine the<br />\nsound value of an investment.<br /><br />\nSecurity value\u2014earning power and possibilities of enhancement or depreciation in value<br />\nover a period of years, must all be thoroughly<br />\nanalyzed.<br />\nSince the house was established, Gillet &amp;<br />\nCompany has always emphasized the importance of specific, dependable information and<br />\nhas made it a policy to apply this principle to<br />\nits investment offerings.<br />\nWe offer to conservative investors a broad<br />\nlist of safe, thoroughly investigated securities.<br />\nInvestors who consider safety, marketability,<br />\nand a steady income of the first importance,and<br />\nprofitably make their selections from our offerings.
