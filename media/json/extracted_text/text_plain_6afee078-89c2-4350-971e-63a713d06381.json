This practice was abandoned in 1948 when the<br />\nentire graduating class of Northwestern University, blinded by<br />\ntassels hanging in their eyes, made a wrong turn during commencement exercises and ended up at the Great Lakes Naval<br />\nTraining Center where, all unwitting, they were inducted into<br />\nthe submarine service for five-year hitches.<br />\n<br />\nThere is a growing body of opinion which bolds that the<br />\ntassel should be worn on the same side you keep your Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes on. Thus a quick glance will show you where your<br />\nMarlboros are and save much time and fumbling.<br />\nThis makes a good deal of sense becau\u00a7e when one wants a<br />\nMarlboro, one wants one with a minimum of delay. One does<br />\nnot relish being kept, even for a second,from the heaps of joy,<br />\nthe barrels of pleasure, the scads of content,.the loads of glee,<br />\nthe lumps of ecstasy, that one gets from that filter, that flavor,<br />\nthat flip-top box.<br />\nThere is another group, small but vocal, which insists the<br />\ntassel should bang over the back of the cap. The tassel, they say,<br />\nis a symbol like the bullfighter's pigtail, signifying honor and<br />\ncourage.<br />\nThey are wrong. Bullfighters wear pigtails for only one<br />\nreason: to keep the backs of their necks warm. Do you have any<br />\nidea what a draft a bull makes when he rushes past you? A<br />\nplenty big anc, you may be sure.<br />\nIn fact, upper respiratory infections, contracted in the wake<br />\nof passing bulls, is the largest single cause of bull-ring fatalities.<br />\nI have this interesting statistic from the Bullfighters Mutual<br />\nInsurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut.
