At this point<br />\nMcElroy, who had run himself out,<br />\ndropped back, and the run developed<br />\ninto a duel between the two Metropolitans stars. The harriers went into<br />\nthe final 440 even, but here Southard's<br />\nslightly superior stamina asserted itself, and he opened up a five-yard gap<br />\nwhich he continually increased, crossing the line 15 yards ahead.<br />\nAn equally thrilling struggle was<br />\nwaged over third position between<br />\nMartak, City College, and Peterson of<br />\nCurtis. Martak, who is only 13 years<br />\nold, and considered one of the finest<br />\nprospects in the state, led up to the<br />\nlast 50 yards, when the Curtis runner made his bid and succeeded in<br />\nnosing out his competitor at the tape.<br />\nOther local harriers to perform well<br />\nwere Brown, City College; McElroy,<br />\nMt.
