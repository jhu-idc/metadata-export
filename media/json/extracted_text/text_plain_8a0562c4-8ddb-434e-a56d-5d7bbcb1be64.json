In the case of faculty members assigned<br />\nto freshman orientation groups, of course, the discrepancy between theory and practice is not so great as in the ease of the<br />\nplan for upperclassmen.<br />\nBut even the freshmen, most of whom are in dire need .of<br />\nadvising, receive inadequate help. The groups are too large and,<br />\nexcept for two or three individuals whose work in this field far<br />\noutshines that of the rest, either a clearer understanding of the<br />\nstudents' problems or a little more interest in them, or both, is<br />\nlacking in the adviser personnel. To have accomplished merely<br />\nan attempt\u2014as obliging as many of the freshmen advisers have<br />\nbeen\u2014is not sufficient.<br />\nThe system as it affects Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors is<br />\nnothing more than a joke. That an official on whom one is supposed to depend for serious consultation should avoid his charge,<br />\nor gleefully profess ignorance of all rules and regulations, is<br />\ncertainly a disgrace in a university of our stature.<br />\nTwo channels for improvement lie open. Either the advisers<br />\nshould be chosen from among the faculty with more judgment<br />\nas to their value in that specialized capacity, or else a separate<br />\nsource for guiding inforniation should be established. It is hoped<br />\nthat, with the revisions that are part of the New Plan, some<br />\nthought has been devoted to replacing our mythical system with<br />\na concrete and efficiently wotkable method of advising.<br />\n<br />\nFRATERNITIES AGAIN<br />\nSome misunderstanding may have been sown as a result of<br />\nlast week's editorial on fraternity rushing. While devoting this<br />\nwhole column to that subject, we in no way intended to establish<br />\nthat fraternities are an indispensable or even an important part<br />\nof the Hopkins picture.<br />\nThere is a decided gain, we feel, to be derived from membership in a social fraternity. Such an association in many cases<br />\npads the sharp frame of university life, resulting in some small<br />\naddition to the young man's growth of presence and confidence.<br />\nThere are of course a great many instances where fraternity influence would be found negligible\u2014where affiliation is worth only<br />\nthe pleasure one derives from it. In the majority of cases its<br />\nvalue goes little beyond this.<br />\nThe harm in fraternities, which is always more of a threat to<br />\nthe whole university than to the unchangeable individuals who<br />\nare directly involved, is the tendency of such traditional groups<br />\nto emphasize a' traditionally collegiate life.

These advisers participa<br />\nte<br />\nin the orientation week program and continue with their<br />\nstudents throughout the freshman year. In later<br />\nyears<br />\nstudents are assigned to advisers in their major fields<br />\nof<br />\nstudy who confer with them regularly and assign the<br />\ncourses to be taken.<br /><br />\nan<br />\nrib<br />\nat<br />\nha<br /><br />\nbe<br />\nto<br /><br />\nThis, as any Hopkins student must know by now, is unfortunately pure fiction. In the case of faculty members assigned<br />\nto freshman orientation groups, of course, the discrepancy between theory and practice is not so great as in the ease of the<br />\nplan for upperclassmen.<br />\nBut even the freshmen, most of whom are in dire need .of<br />\nadvising, receive inadequate help. The groups are too large and,<br />\nexcept for two or three individuals whose work in this field far<br />\noutshines that of the rest, either a clearer understanding of the<br />\nstudents' problems or a little more interest in them, or both, is<br />\nlacking in the adviser personnel. To have accomplished merely<br />\nan attempt\u2014as obliging as many of the freshmen advisers have<br />\nbeen\u2014is not sufficient.<br />\nThe system as it affects Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors is<br />\nnothing more than a joke. That an official on whom one is supposed to depend for serious consultation should avoid his charge,<br />\nor gleefully profess ignorance of all rules and regulations, is<br />\ncertainly a disgrace in a university of our stature.<br />\nTwo channels for improvement lie open. Either the advisers<br />\nshould be chosen from among the faculty with more judgment<br />\nas to their value in that specialized capacity, or else a separate<br />\nsource for guiding inforniation should be established. It is hoped<br />\nthat, with the revisions that are part of the New Plan, some<br />\nthought has been devoted to replacing our mythical system with<br />\na concrete and efficiently wotkable method of advising.<br /><br />\nFRATERNITIES AGAIN<br />\nSome misunderstanding may have been sown as a result of<br />\nlast week's editorial on fraternity rushing. While devoting this<br />\nwhole column to that subject, we in no way intended to establish<br />\nthat fraternities are an indispensable or even an important part<br />\nof the Hopkins picture.<br />\nThere is a decided gain, we feel, to be derived from membership in a social fraternity. Such an association in many cases<br />\npads the sharp frame of university life, resulting in some small<br />\naddition to the young man's growth of presence and confidence.<br />\nThere are of course a great many instances where fraternity influence would be found negligible\u2014where affiliation is worth only<br />\nthe pleasure one derives from it. In the majority of cases its<br />\nvalue goes little beyond this.<br />\nThe harm in fraternities, which is always more of a threat to<br />\nthe whole university than to the unchangeable individuals who<br />\nare directly involved, is the tendency of such traditional groups<br />\nto emphasize a' traditionally collegiate life. This harm materializes when there is a succesful attempt to minimize the true purpose<br />\nand influence of the university.<br /><br />\nLevering Hall, a popular place to relax.<br />\nEugene Levering and a group of in the assimilation of<br />\nforeign stu- ogist and minister each of which friends sometime during 1929.<br />\ndents.
