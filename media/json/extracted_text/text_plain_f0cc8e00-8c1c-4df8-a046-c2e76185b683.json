I<br />\nmarried Dan to give my baby a<br />\nname - - it didn't mean I had to be<br />\nfaithful to him!\") That is:<br />\nthat there seem to be in this society two desires motivating two<br />\ndistinct publics to read news periodicals. One, the healthy desire to<br />\nencounter in what one reads the<br />\nfacts pertinent to one's daily existence; and the other, an unhealthy<br />\nlusting after anecdotes into which<br />\none can project a romantic image<br />\nof oneself, an image of oneself as<br />\nparticipant in the events recounted<br />\nin the anecdote. These desires are<br />\nsatisfied by (1) tabloids (The Enquirer, Midnight, The Tattler, Insider, Key-Hole,and Truth)and by<br />\n<br />\nBut what are we to think about the soldier who with the final<br />\nbloody twitch of muscles gasps,\"Drano.\" We should think of him as<br />\nwe think of ourselves, for it is our nightmare as well as his.<br />\nChildren of the forthcoming doom, we have no answer for you.<br />\nYou don't even have an answer.

They also<br />\nthough it is getting more expensive. These are all good signs. It means<br />\nthat these are values we are given simply because we live in our<br />\nbodies. Other values do not come easily.<br />\nAnd it is this questio of values, priorities, that we must face. To<br />\ncontinue in the manner history is accustomed to, priorities have to be<br />\nrewritten and pondered. We have to decide that nirvana is nowhere,<br />\nand that heaven is a drag.<br />\nWhat we must do, eventually, is metamorphosize into a race of<br />\nPlastic Men. Able to fill any container we find ourselves in. Television<br />\ncommercials, it must be remembered, are made of celluloid.

We wish you a quiet death in black and white.<br />\n<br />\nA Journalistic Digression<br />\nOver the past year,as usual, the purpose and content of the NewsLetter have met heated criticism. The purpose of this paper has always been clear to us. We want to arouse controversy, we want to<br />\ncriticize- the University in areas we feel need reform - - not only to<br />\nmake the News-Letter a good paper, but to make the University a<br />\nbetter place to spend our four years. Though, as the only weekly<br />\npublication, we have an obligation to comprehensively report on campus news, we have tried to broaden our content with relevant information and comment on the political, social and artistic scenes. The<br />\nHopkins student body is introverted enough; perhaps the News-Letter is the medium to change this attitude.<br />\nThis has been our policy for the last year. It is a policy'which we<br />\nhope the new editors will continue.<br />\n<br />\nHENRY KOTICK paid university coed, Sheila Barnes<br />\nto go to bed with him<br />\n(2) legit newspapers (The Times,<br />\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch,The<br />\nSun).

And yet, as<br />\nhas always been the case, they do<br />\nnot have a piece of anything. The<br />\nillusion we will call the Illusion of<br />\nControl, arising from the Illusion<br />\nof Information, means simply<br />\nthat the average citizen (grocer,<br />\ninvalid, child) feels that whatever<br />\nis occurring in the governing of the<br />\nnation is knowable by him and ultimately referrable to him.(I vote!<br />\nWhat I say goes! I must know what<br />\nis going on to know how best to<br />\ndeploy my vote!)

It<br />\nhas become a famous pain in the<br />\nass since a participant in the recent<br />\nconference designed to improve<br />\nHopkins' relations with the community had his car towed away.<br />\nSince a fine goes with the violation<br />\nanyway, now that Hopkins has<br />\npurchased a garage near the campus, why not have cars towed<br />\nthere instead?<br />\nRich Conviser<br />\nSocial Relations<br />\nNEIN TO THE VECTOR<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn response to your article on<br />\nthe \"demise\" of the Vector, I<br />\nwould like to say first that neither<br />\nthe SAC nor Mr. Bilgrave's office<br />\nwas approached by any of your reporters concerning the issue in an<br />\neffort to seek out the facts.<br />\nThe Vector is not put to rest by<br />\nany means nor is it meant to be a<br />\nmoney-making business. For that<br />\nmatter, we do not consider the<br />\nNews-Letter to be a money-making<br />\nbusiness either. Our only stipulation monetarily is that an organization should not incur a debt at the<br />\nend of the academic year.<br />\nIn May of each year the president of the Student Council, the<br />\nChairman of the SAC, and Mr.<br />\nBilgrave meet to review the past<br />\noperations of each organization<br />\nand to. decide on the budgets for<br />\nthe forthcoming year. Naturally<br />\nevery organization would like some<br />\nincrease in its funds and when<br />\nsound reasons and past performances are presented increases are very<br />\npossible. Certainly the News-Letter can attest to this.<br />\nNow, the question at hand is<br />\nthe Vector. Without using figures<br />\nthe Vector incurred a substantial<br />\ndebt at the end of last year due<br />\nmainly to the publication of its<br />\nMay issue. Charles Polnitsky, editor-in-chief of the Vector, at that<br />\ntime said that he and his staff had<br />\nmiscalculated advertising revenues<br />\nand printing costs but that a subscription campaign was already in<br />\nthe planning stages for this year.<br />\nBy manipulating funds and seeking emergency university funds we<br />\nwere able to match a yearly budget<br />\nfor this year even after deducting<br />\nthe deficit.<br />\nWe acknowledge the unfortunate results of the subscription<br />\ncampaign. We acknowledge the effort and time spent by the Vector<br />\nstaff. We acknowledge the Vector's<br />\nattempt at revitalization. But, we<br />\ncannot acknowledge irresponsibility. In putting out a publication<br />\nsuch as the Vector or the NewsLetter there is a two-fold and equal<br />\ntask. One is to achieve its artistic<br />\npurpose and the other is to maintain itself financially.<br />\nFrom speaking with Mr. Polnitsky it appears that neither he nor<br />\nhis staff can meet this responsibility. First, he told us that neither<br />\nhe nor his editorial staff would<br />\ntake any responsibility for the debt<br />\nincurred last spring. Secondly, he<br />\nsaid that they would not take the<br />\nresponsibility for failing to publish<br />\nthe last two issues this year as they<br />\nare already in debt from the first<br />\ntwo issues. And lastly, if we could<br />\nnot meet their financial demands<br />\nneither he nor his staff would take<br />\nthe responsibility for publishing a<br />\nVector next year.<br />\nAlternate solutions were offered to Mr. Polnitsky by Mr. Bilgrave and myself and it was made<br />\nclear that the Vector would receive a budget of $800 \u2014 $1,000<br />\nfor next year.<br />\nJed P. Luchow<br />\nChairman, SAC<br />\n<br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nSWEET ELLA<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI have just finished reading<br />\n\"Yes,Virginia, There Are Students<br />\nWho Don't Protest\" by Ella Katz.<br />\nPerhaps she is right, maybe she is<br />\nwrong. However, I can only conclude that the writer has a sick,<br />\nwarped mind. In talking about a<br />\nbetter world in which to live shei<br />\nsays - - \"Nobody said they would<br />\nstop the war or build highways or<br />\npass gun legislation or effect free<br />\ntelephone service or kill the Jews<br />\nor force little girls to give them<br />\npleasure. At least the latter part of<br />\nthe sentence shows a macabre<br />\nsense of humor at the worst a diseased mind. There was a Hitler<br />\nwho thought this way once<br />\n6,000,000 Jews paid the price.<br />\nWith such statements can any of us<br />\ntruly believe that the writer, or<br />\neven the editors, are truly concerned about the oppressed and underprivileged of this world.Your own<br />\nwords give the lie back to you.<br />\nPerhaps there is yet one more protest due at Johns Hopkins. Let all<br />\nfair-minded students organize and<br />\nprotest the printing of such diabolical slander in the News-Letter.<br />\nI further hope that the Editors<br />\nof News-Letter have the decency<br />\nto publicly apologize for the sickening statement which they printed.<br />\nYou claim to be for decency.<br />\nProve it.<br />\nSick at heart,<br />\nSimon Cohen<br />\nTAYLOR FARCE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn September, my parents were<br />\nsuckered into taking out health insurance for my wife and myself<br />\nunder that phony plan sponsored<br />\nby Hopkins. I remember an editorial of yours that criticized the<br />\nboys in Whitehead Hall for advertising their plan to our parents in a<br />\nvery misleading fashion.<br />\nIn early October, my wife sustained a minor injury in the kitchen. We had the injury treated at<br />\na local hospital.

If 10% of the<br />\nstudents are doves and 5% are<br />\nhawks, and only these 15% answered the poll, you can say that<br />\ntwo thirds of the students are<br />\ndoves but it isn't really honest to<br />\nto do so, because only a few people answered and these few cannot<br />\nbe taken as a representative sample.<br />\nBased on the above it is also<br />\npossible to say only 10% of the<br />\nstudents consider themselves doves<br />\nor only 5% consider themselves<br />\nhawks.. As presented, the results<br />\nare essentially meaningless and useless for anything except providing<br />\nfront;page pyroof..o.r .evidence. to<br />\n<br />\nsupport somebody's point of view<br />\nand they can be distorted to prove<br />\njust about anything.<br />\nHOW MANY STUDENTS ANSWERED THE POLL AND HOW<br />\nMANY DIDN'T?!?<br />\nI would very much like to see<br />\nthe results of the Student Council<br />\nPoll presented again only with<br />\nHONEST statistics, including how<br />\nmany students did and didn't<br />\nrespond.

For this assertion, he has provided as proof, a) the fact that the.<br />\nexcellent film by Felix Greene<br />\nshown two weeks ago did not draw<br />\na large audience, and b) the assertion by sarcastic means that people are too interested in the frivolous activities of rushing,gambling,<br />\nlacrosse, et. al.<br />\nI take exception to the presentation of both a) and b) as valid<br />\nproof for his argument. Non-attendance at a film does not indicate<br />\nan attitude of apathy. In my opinion the attitude being expressed is<br />\none of boredom.

His<br />\nmain points focused on the government's inability to deal with<br />\nthese problems.<br />\nDr. Abrams spoke of the division between blacks and whites<br />\nwhich he believes is growing. He<br />\nagreed with the President's Commission on Civil Disorders and<br />\nSpoke of their report as a \"great<br />\ndocument.- Like the Commission,<br />\nhe predicted more riots this summer, and laid the blame on the<br />\ngovernment's apathy.<br />\nAbrams went on to discuss the<br />\nfederal housing policy and how it<br />\nfails to meet the problem. He<br />\nsaid that most cities have a large<br />\namount of relatively cheap housing<br />\nand that the bill does not aid the<br />\nPoor in becoming home-owners<br />\nbecause it does not provide mortgage funds. Dr. Abrams believes<br />\nthat Ownership is a great antidote<br />\nagainst destructive rioting.<br />\nIn conclusion, he called for a<br />\ncomplete re-orientation in America's thinking about urban affairs.<br />\nHe presented a three point program designed to re-educate America so that it might Understa<br />\nnd its<br />\nOwn problems.<br />\nFirst, he believes that the U.S.<br />\nneeds a 'fiscal revolution,' in which<br />\nthe federal government<br />\nwould<br />\nassume much greater responsibilities in the fields of safety, health<br />\nand education. Second,<br />\nDr.<br />\nAbrams believes that the city and<br />\nsuburb should be considered as a<br />\n<br />\nsingle entity. Finally, he said that<br />\nThroughout his speech, Dr.<br />\nhousing must be planned with Abrams<br />\ncontinued to attack the<br />\nenvironmental considerations in<br />\ngovernment's lack of true interest<br />\nmind.<br />\n<br />\nin the problem of saving our cities.<br />\nHe ridiculed the Johnson administration's hollow attempts at alleviating the conditions of the city.<br />\n<br />\nHe would replace all of these<br />\nmeasures, with a complete change<br />\nin the thinking of the America<br />\na<br />\npeople.<br />\n<br />\nA Message: to Business, Commerce and<br />\nLiberal Arts Graduates\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nERE<br />\nTHE<br />\nONLY<br />\nIS\"<br />\nWouldn't you like to build your career WHERE<br />\nTHE MONEY IS?

Since the October<br />\nPeace March, membership has declined until less than thirty people<br />\nremain actively participating. Many<br />\nstudents have left the Viet Nam<br />\nCommittee in favor of the Students for McCarthy organization.<br />\nThe organization has been restructured with three, or perhaps<br />\nfour, subcommittees under a coordinating committee.

Membership<br />\nand participation has not increased<br />\nappreciably. Those whom the corn-<br />\n<br />\nmittee asks to conduct lectures or<br />\ndebates feel that enough is already<br />\nbeing done.<br />\nThe leadership of the committee would like to merge their organization with another group at<br />\nHopkins.

The replies from these<br />\nareas indicated that the inhabitants<br />\npreferred societies where a \"decent\" standard oflaw and morality<br />\nis strictly upheld by well backed<br />\npolice forces triumphing over\u2022<br />\ncrime and manifestations of radical<br />\nthought. Most of these people were<br />\ntherefore reasigned to countries<br />\nbehind the iron curtain.<br />\n- - the depopulation of American Urban Cultural centers. These<br />\ninhabitants, giving various indications of preferring creative societies, were matched up with London, Paris and all of Scandanavia.<br />\n- - the stagnation of Los Angeles. Cards received from Southern<br />\nCalifornia did not compute.<br />\n- - the overpopulation of Red<br />\nChina. All persons who perferred<br />\natmospheres of encouraged militarism and patriotism, all those<br />\nwho believed in exagerated ideas<br />\nof \"national honor\" were assigned<br />\nto this particular society.<br />\n- - the overpopulation of Africa. This was due to the heavy influence of Black Nationalists in<br />\nthe Northern United States and<br />\nthe interception of black ballets<br />\nby Southern racists. Both groups<br />\nwere to be fooled however by<br />\n- - the repopulation of the United States, mostly by the more<br />\nbackward tribesmen of Africa,<br />\nSouth America and Australia. It is<br />\nhard to explain this phenomena,<br />\nexcept by pointing out that the<br />\ntribesmen involved are all affected by a high degree of feticism,<br />\nrigid and often contradictory moral taboos and the widespread practice of cannibalism.<br />\n- - the disappearance of Vietnam. It would have been interesting to see exactly what sort of society the Vietnamese desired. However, at the time this is being written there has been no reply from<br />\nthat part of the world, leading us<br />\nto believe the morbid rumor that<br />\nthere are actually no surviving<br />\nVietnamese. A prompt and authoritarian denial of this by the administration would all but confirnt<br />\nour fears.<br />\nIn addition to tabulating the<br />\ncorrect social placement of entire<br />\npeoples, the SAFP project paid<br />\nspecial attention to the desires of<br />\nthe world's leading statesmen.

Nixon, or two if you're counting Harold Stassen. When Big<br />\nGeorge pulled out last week he was<br />\nonly stating the obvious. He came<br />\nin like a winner and went out<br />\ngracefully. But in between Romney died from a severe case of<br />\nfoot-in-mouth disease. His \"great<br />\nWhite father\" image smacked of<br />\nhypocrisy; his rising from the rear<br />\nstrategy was politically perverse.<br />\nSo now George Romney is a tool<br />\nof the historian's imagination.<br />\nFarewell, George.<br />\nTo those of us, however, who<br />\ndread giving the GOP nod to Nixon<br />\nas a sop for saving the party banner all these many years, Romney<br />\ncould have been a little more courageous to withdraw in favor of<br />\nanother contender, i.e. Nelson<br />\nRockefeller, his long-time supportter. Perhaps it was just bad timing,<br />\nOr maybe George and Rocky<br />\nhaven't been so buddy-buddy after<br />\nall. But the long hoped for exit of<br />\nRomney in favor of Rockefeller<br />\nWent over like a lead balloon.<br />\nRockefeller is no closer to being in<br />\nthe race a week after Romney's<br />\nfall than he was a week before.<br />\nAnd that is the real loss for the<br />\nGOP.<br />\nAs Governor Agnew pointed<br />\nout, Nixon's triumph over Strassen<br />\nin New Hampshire will prove absolutely nothing. Carrying the<br />\npoint further, Governor<br />\nMcCall<br />\nmcCall of Oregon stated at the<br />\nNational Governors Conference in<br />\nWashington that unless Rockefeller<br />\nenters the race, and does so soon,<br />\nthe series of six primaries leading<br />\nto the Miami Beach convention<br />\nWill amount to a grandiose farce.<br />\nIf Popularly advocated contenders<br />\nuon't compete in the primaries,<br />\nthen the purpose of the primary<br />\nelection system to democratize<br />\nthe electoral process will go up in<br />\nsmoke this year. Thus, with Romney's withdrawal, there exists a'<br />\nWide and possibly dangerous vacuum within the moderate to liberal leadership of the GOP.<br />\nIt seems hard to believe that<br />\nany<br />\nbut Rockefeller can fill<br />\nthis void. Charles Percy still remains the idol of idealistic dreamers, the dark horse to pull out of<br />\nthe stable in the event of a deadlock at the convention. Ronald<br />\nReagan doesn't have a prayer for<br />\nthe<br />\nnomination unless something<br />\nquite fatal happens to Nixon. That<br />\n\u00b0Id story about conservative<br />\nsT,trength abandoning Nixon for<br />\nrkeagan just never came true.

Yet for<br />\nmany who looked at the GOP as<br />\nthe rostrum of hope and new vitality in the American political system year or so ago, it is depressing<br />\nto admit that the best the party<br />\nhas to offer is a super-Machiavelli<br />\nand a governor who just wants to<br />\nfade away peacefully. Where is the<br />\nvigor and excitement that John F.<br />\nKennedy brought to the political<br />\narena? What happened to the imaginative programs that would end<br />\npoverty and war?

Venom! Debauchery on the beach and in the<br />\nbedroom! Banned in Denmark!<br />\nNo admittance under 18! With the<br />\ninevitable result that we all hotfooted it down to the 7th East,<br />\nflashed our student cards, scrambled into our seats, and foreheads<br />\nbeaded with perspiration sat waiting for the curtain to rise with delicious visions of Scandanavian<br />\nperversions dancing through our<br />\nheads.<br />\nAll of which made for an exasperating evening. For every time<br />\nthe plot was threatening to thicken<br />\n(congeal is perhaps closer) the action would be blocked out by an<br />\nenormous X which, in order to fill<br />\nin the gaps in the story line, automatically forced one to employ his<br />\nimagination (Which is sorely deficient to begin with. Why else<br />\nwould I have paid the fare?).<br />\nIf one can conceive of the intellectual fodder resulting from<br />\nFrancoise Sagan rewriting Bonjour<br />\nTristesse while in her late forties<br />\nthen one has a somewhat clearer<br />\n<br />\npicture of what Venom had to offer the viewer. For it's all about<br />\nthis positively beastly young man<br />\nnamed Per who sets about corrupting the morals of sweet little Suzanne, the innocent (but built)<br />\ndaughter of a wealthy businessman<br />\nwho is himself experiencing marital woes.<br />\nScintillating in her<br />\none piece bathing suit our heroine<br />\nis seductively stretched out on the<br />\nfamily's private water front soaking up the sun and trying to cram<br />\nfor University finals when she<br />\nmeets Evil Incarnate in the guise<br />\nof Per. Now Per, if you're still<br />\nwith me, seeing what he likes best<br />\nignores the posted Do Not Enter<br />\nsigns, storms up the beach, snows<br />\npoor Suzanne before she can so<br />\nmuch as turn another page in her<br />\nBiology text, and proceeds, all in<br />\none shot, to convince her to star<br />\nin a film he is currently piecing together on the hypocrisy of traditional morals. With a little help<br />\nfrom his friends Per eventually<br />\nmanages to come up with some<br />\ndownright fascinating home movies. With absolutely nothing going<br />\n<br />\nto the cutting room floor Suzanne's mother is given a sneak preview and nearly gags at her daughter's indelicate part. Needless to<br />\nsay daddy is telephoned at the office straight away.<br />\nWell after that the tension just<br />\nhits a feverish'pitch. And there we<br />\nsat, horny little prigs that we are,<br />\nwhile director Knud Leif Thornsen (pronounced nude leaf) rambled on about the nasty and less<br />\nthan discrete morals practised by<br />\nmom and dad and Suzanne and<br />\nPer. And we lapped it up.<br />\nSad to think that Pietro Germi's<br />\ntender tale of real life and real<br />\nmorals should be prematurely ushered out by the management to<br />\nmake room for something as dismal as this. For those faster than a<br />\nspeeding bullet who , like myself,<br />\nmanaged to catch The Climax before its almost simultaneous arrival<br />\nand departure were treated to a<br />\npoignantly filmed story of a wildly<br />\nenergetic Italian who happens to<br />\nhave three wives stashed around<br />\nthe countryside., The strain of an<br />\nimpossible family life has begun to<br />\n<br />\ncleanse his conscience by confessing all to a priest. But his domestic problems prove just as complicated to his kindly confessor who<br />\nis unable to suggest a workable<br />\nsolution. \"What can I do?\" the<br />\npenitent Don Juan asks helplessly.<br />\n\"Should I divorce them?\" The<br />\ngood father at this point is at his<br />\nwits end as to how he should best<br />\ncounsel this sorrowful sinner.<br />\nBleary-eyed after much soul<br />\nsearching he blurts out hopelessly,<br />\n\"Yes, yes, divorce. That's it.\" But<br />\nit was only an unguarded emotional outburst and he quickly recants.<br />\n\"My, God,\" he cries. \"Divorce!<br />\nWhat am I saying!\"<br />\nThe dialogue of Climax reveals<br />\nthe real world, and the sheltered<br />\nworld of the Church whose decrees periodically emanate from<br />\nbehind the cloistered stone walls<br />\nof the Vatican. Director Germi<br />\nraises the question as to whether<br />\nthe Catholic Hierarchy can, even in<br />\nits infinite wisdom, truly establish<br />\nfeasible guidelines for moral conduct in an impossible world.<br />\n<br />\nCIVIC CENTER SUN., MAR. 24<br />\n201 W.

The purpose of this paper has always been clear to us. We want to arouse controversy, we want to<br />\ncriticize- the University in areas we feel need reform - - not only to<br />\nmake the News-Letter a good paper, but to make the University a<br />\nbetter place to spend our four years. Though, as the only weekly<br />\npublication, we have an obligation to comprehensively report on campus news, we have tried to broaden our content with relevant information and comment on the political, social and artistic scenes. The<br />\nHopkins student body is introverted enough; perhaps the News-Letter is the medium to change this attitude.<br />\nThis has been our policy for the last year.

It<br />\nhas become a famous pain in the<br />\nass since a participant in the recent<br />\nconference designed to improve<br />\nHopkins' relations with the community had his car towed away.<br />\nSince a fine goes with the violation<br />\nanyway, now that Hopkins has<br />\npurchased a garage near the campus, why not have cars towed<br />\nthere instead?<br />\nRich Conviser<br />\nSocial Relations<br />\nNEIN TO THE VECTOR<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn response to your article on<br />\nthe \"demise\" of the Vector, I<br />\nwould like to say first that neither<br />\nthe SAC nor Mr. Bilgrave's office<br />\nwas approached by any of your reporters concerning the issue in an<br />\neffort to seek out the facts.<br />\nThe Vector is not put to rest by<br />\nany means nor is it meant to be a<br />\nmoney-making business. For that<br />\nmatter, we do not consider the<br />\nNews-Letter to be a money-making<br />\nbusiness either. Our only stipulation monetarily is that an organization should not incur a debt at the<br />\nend of the academic year.<br />\nIn May of each year the president of the Student Council, the<br />\nChairman of the SAC, and Mr.<br />\nBilgrave meet to review the past<br />\noperations of each organization<br />\nand to. decide on the budgets for<br />\nthe forthcoming year. Naturally<br />\nevery organization would like some<br />\nincrease in its funds and when<br />\nsound reasons and past performances are presented increases are very<br />\npossible. Certainly the News-Letter can attest to this.<br />\nNow, the question at hand is<br />\nthe Vector. Without using figures<br />\nthe Vector incurred a substantial<br />\ndebt at the end of last year due<br />\nmainly to the publication of its<br />\nMay issue. Charles Polnitsky, editor-in-chief of the Vector, at that<br />\ntime said that he and his staff had<br />\nmiscalculated advertising revenues<br />\nand printing costs but that a subscription campaign was already in<br />\nthe planning stages for this year.<br />\nBy manipulating funds and seeking emergency university funds we<br />\nwere able to match a yearly budget<br />\nfor this year even after deducting<br />\nthe deficit.<br />\nWe acknowledge the unfortunate results of the subscription<br />\ncampaign. We acknowledge the effort and time spent by the Vector<br />\nstaff. We acknowledge the Vector's<br />\nattempt at revitalization. But, we<br />\ncannot acknowledge irresponsibility. In putting out a publication<br />\nsuch as the Vector or the NewsLetter there is a two-fold and equal<br />\ntask. One is to achieve its artistic<br />\npurpose and the other is to maintain itself financially.<br />\nFrom speaking with Mr. Polnitsky it appears that neither he nor<br />\nhis staff can meet this responsibility. First, he told us that neither<br />\nhe nor his editorial staff would<br />\ntake any responsibility for the debt<br />\nincurred last spring. Secondly, he<br />\nsaid that they would not take the<br />\nresponsibility for failing to publish<br />\nthe last two issues this year as they<br />\nare already in debt from the first<br />\ntwo issues. And lastly, if we could<br />\nnot meet their financial demands<br />\nneither he nor his staff would take<br />\nthe responsibility for publishing a<br />\nVector next year.<br />\nAlternate solutions were offered to Mr. Polnitsky by Mr. Bilgrave and myself and it was made<br />\nclear that the Vector would receive a budget of $800 \u2014 $1,000<br />\nfor next year.<br />\nJed P.

However, I can only conclude that the writer has a sick,<br />\nwarped mind. In talking about a<br />\nbetter world in which to live shei<br />\nsays - - \"Nobody said they would<br />\nstop the war or build highways or<br />\npass gun legislation or effect free<br />\ntelephone service or kill the Jews<br />\nor force little girls to give them<br />\npleasure.

I remember an editorial of yours that criticized the<br />\nboys in Whitehead Hall for advertising their plan to our parents in a<br />\nvery misleading fashion.<br />\nIn early October, my wife sustained a minor injury in the kitchen. We had the injury treated at<br />\na local hospital. I payed the bill<br />\nmyself, notified the company, filled out a detailed report of the accident,and sent the report and my<br />\nreceipt on to the company.<br />\nThat was in November. 1 have<br />\nreceived no answer from the company.

If 10% of the<br />\nstudents are doves and 5% are<br />\nhawks, and only these 15% answered the poll, you can say that<br />\ntwo thirds of the students are<br />\ndoves but it isn't really honest to<br />\nto do so, because only a few people answered and these few cannot<br />\nbe taken as a representative sample.<br />\nBased on the above it is also<br />\npossible to say only 10% of the<br />\nstudents consider themselves doves<br />\nor only 5% consider themselves<br />\nhawks.. As presented, the results<br />\nare essentially meaningless and useless for anything except providing<br />\nfront;page pyroof..o.r .evidence. to<br /><br />\nsupport somebody's point of view<br />\nand they can be distorted to prove<br />\njust about anything.<br />\nHOW MANY STUDENTS ANSWERED THE POLL AND HOW<br />\nMANY DIDN'T?!?<br />\nI would very much like to see<br />\nthe results of the Student Council<br />\nPoll presented again only with<br />\nHONEST statistics, including how<br />\nmany students did and didn't<br />\nrespond. I would also like to see<br />\nthe News-Letter Draft Poll results<br />\npresented in the same way.<br />\nWhatever they are, I'd like to<br />\nsee the FACTS presented in the<br />\nNews-Letter, not somebody's pet<br />\nopinion.

His<br />\nmain points focused on the government's inability to deal with<br />\nthese problems.<br />\nDr. Abrams spoke of the division between blacks and whites<br />\nwhich he believes is growing. He<br />\nagreed with the President's Commission on Civil Disorders and<br />\nSpoke of their report as a \"great<br />\ndocument.- Like the Commission,<br />\nhe predicted more riots this summer, and laid the blame on the<br />\ngovernment's apathy.<br />\nAbrams went on to discuss the<br />\nfederal housing policy and how it<br />\nfails to meet the problem. He<br />\nsaid that most cities have a large<br />\namount of relatively cheap housing<br />\nand that the bill does not aid the<br />\nPoor in becoming home-owners<br />\nbecause it does not provide mortgage funds. Dr. Abrams believes<br />\nthat Ownership is a great antidote<br />\nagainst destructive rioting.<br />\nIn conclusion, he called for a<br />\ncomplete re-orientation in America's thinking about urban affairs.<br />\nHe presented a three point program designed to re-educate America so that it might Understa<br />\nnd its<br />\nOwn problems.<br />\nFirst, he believes that the U.S.<br />\nneeds a 'fiscal revolution,' in which<br />\nthe federal government<br />\nwould<br />\nassume much greater responsibilities in the fields of safety, health<br />\nand education. Second,<br />\nDr.<br />\nAbrams believes that the city and<br />\nsuburb should be considered as a<br /><br />\nsingle entity. Finally, he said that<br />\nThroughout his speech, Dr.<br />\nhousing must be planned with Abrams<br />\ncontinued to attack the<br />\nenvironmental considerations in<br />\ngovernment's lack of true interest<br />\nmind.<br /><br />\nin the problem of saving our cities.<br />\nHe ridiculed the Johnson administration's hollow attempts at alleviating the conditions of the city.<br /><br />\nHe would replace all of these<br />\nmeasures, with a complete change<br />\nin the thinking of the America<br />\na<br />\npeople.<br /><br />\nA Message: to Business, Commerce and<br />\nLiberal Arts Graduates\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nERE<br />\nTHE<br />\nONLY<br />\nIS\"<br />\nWouldn't you like to build your career WHERE<br />\nTHE MONEY IS?

According to<br />\na committee officer, response to<br />\nthe survey indicates that opinion<br />\nat Hopkins runs more than threeto-one against the war.<br />\n27 Members<br />\nThe group felt that the need<br />\nfor reorganization, since, despite<br />\nthe anti-war sentiment at Hopkins, membership in the committee<br />\nremains small. Since the October<br />\nPeace March, membership has declined until less than thirty people<br />\nremain actively participating. Many<br />\nstudents have left the Viet Nam<br />\nCommittee in favor of the Students for McCarthy organization.<br />\nThe organization has been restructured with three, or perhaps<br />\nfour, subcommittees under a coordinating committee.

Membership<br />\nand participation has not increased<br />\nappreciably. Those whom the corn-<br /><br />\nmittee asks to conduct lectures or<br />\ndebates feel that enough is already<br />\nbeing done.<br />\nThe leadership of the committee would like to merge their organization with another group at<br />\nHopkins. This move, they feel<br />\nwould lend a broader base to the<br />\nanti-war movement on campus. At<br /><br />\nthis point, the members are urged<br />\nto join Students for McCarthy,<br />\nRESIST, or both.

The replies from these<br />\nareas indicated that the inhabitants<br />\npreferred societies where a \"decent\" standard oflaw and morality<br />\nis strictly upheld by well backed<br />\npolice forces triumphing over\u2022<br />\ncrime and manifestations of radical<br />\nthought. Most of these people were<br />\ntherefore reasigned to countries<br />\nbehind the iron curtain.<br />\n- - the depopulation of American Urban Cultural centers. These<br />\ninhabitants, giving various indications of preferring creative societies, were matched up with London, Paris and all of Scandanavia.<br />\n- - the stagnation of Los Angeles. Cards received from Southern<br />\nCalifornia did not compute.<br />\n- - the overpopulation of Red<br />\nChina. All persons who perferred<br />\natmospheres of encouraged militarism and patriotism, all those<br />\nwho believed in exagerated ideas<br />\nof \"national honor\" were assigned<br />\nto this particular society.<br />\n- - the overpopulation of Africa. This was due to the heavy influence of Black Nationalists in<br />\nthe Northern United States and<br />\nthe interception of black ballets<br />\nby Southern racists. Both groups<br />\nwere to be fooled however by<br />\n- - the repopulation of the United States, mostly by the more<br />\nbackward tribesmen of Africa,<br />\nSouth America and Australia. It is<br />\nhard to explain this phenomena,<br />\nexcept by pointing out that the<br />\ntribesmen involved are all affected by a high degree of feticism,<br />\nrigid and often contradictory moral taboos and the widespread practice of cannibalism.<br />\n- - the disappearance of Vietnam. It would have been interesting to see exactly what sort of society the Vietnamese desired. However, at the time this is being written there has been no reply from<br />\nthat part of the world, leading us<br />\nto believe the morbid rumor that<br />\nthere are actually no surviving<br />\nVietnamese. A prompt and authoritarian denial of this by the administration would all but confirnt<br />\nour fears.<br />\nIn addition to tabulating the<br />\ncorrect social placement of entire<br />\npeoples, the SAFP project paid<br />\nspecial attention to the desires of<br />\nthe world's leading statesmen. Especially interesting results were<br />\nobtained for:<br />\nHarold Wilson: the Prime Minister of Great Britian indicated<br />\nthat he wanted to lead a nation<br />\nproud of its history and tradition,<br />\nas well as a nation whose post-war<br />\neconomic strength permitted it to<br />\nmaintain a full and commanding<br />\nposition in European affairs.

Nixon, or two if you're counting Harold Stassen. When Big<br />\nGeorge pulled out last week he was<br />\nonly stating the obvious. He came<br />\nin like a winner and went out<br />\ngracefully. But in between Romney died from a severe case of<br />\nfoot-in-mouth disease. His \"great<br />\nWhite father\" image smacked of<br />\nhypocrisy; his rising from the rear<br />\nstrategy was politically perverse.<br />\nSo now George Romney is a tool<br />\nof the historian's imagination.<br />\nFarewell, George.<br />\nTo those of us, however, who<br />\ndread giving the GOP nod to Nixon<br />\nas a sop for saving the party banner all these many years, Romney<br />\ncould have been a little more courageous to withdraw in favor of<br />\nanother contender, i.e. Nelson<br />\nRockefeller, his long-time supportter. Perhaps it was just bad timing,<br />\nOr maybe George and Rocky<br />\nhaven't been so buddy-buddy after<br />\nall. But the long hoped for exit of<br />\nRomney in favor of Rockefeller<br />\nWent over like a lead balloon.<br />\nRockefeller is no closer to being in<br />\nthe race a week after Romney's<br />\nfall than he was a week before.<br />\nAnd that is the real loss for the<br />\nGOP.<br />\nAs Governor Agnew pointed<br />\nout, Nixon's triumph over Strassen<br />\nin New Hampshire will prove absolutely nothing. Carrying the<br />\npoint further, Governor<br />\nMcCall<br />\nmcCall of Oregon stated at the<br />\nNational Governors Conference in<br />\nWashington that unless Rockefeller<br />\nenters the race, and does so soon,<br />\nthe series of six primaries leading<br />\nto the Miami Beach convention<br />\nWill amount to a grandiose farce.<br />\nIf Popularly advocated contenders<br />\nuon't compete in the primaries,<br />\nthen the purpose of the primary<br />\nelection system to democratize<br />\nthe electoral process will go up in<br />\nsmoke this year. Thus, with Romney's withdrawal, there exists a'<br />\nWide and possibly dangerous vacuum within the moderate to liberal leadership of the GOP.<br />\nIt seems hard to believe that<br />\nany<br />\nbut Rockefeller can fill<br />\nthis void. Charles Percy still remains the idol of idealistic dreamers, the dark horse to pull out of<br />\nthe stable in the event of a deadlock at the convention. Ronald<br />\nReagan doesn't have a prayer for<br />\nthe<br />\nnomination unless something<br />\nquite fatal happens to Nixon. That<br />\n\u00b0Id story about conservative<br />\nsT,trength abandoning Nixon for<br />\nrkeagan just never came true. Howas one travels among Young<br />\nePublican circles, it is fair to ad11t that the California governor<br />\nLitpeS attract considerable admira1\u00b0n from the greasier reactionaries<br />\nof the Y.R.<br />\nelement.<br />\nIf Rockefeller doesn't get into<br />\nbthe fight,<br />\nthe Republican party will<br />\nke In serious trouble this Novemue.r. No doubt, Richard Nixon,<br />\nwith his well calculated new image,<br />\n'ind. his well oiled and far reaching<br />\nPolitical machine will walk away<br />\nwith the prize as things currently<br />\nstand. Then we can all enjoy<br />\na.nother four years of good, old<br />\nLyndon (if we live that long), beePtse no matter what tricky Dick<br />\nuoes to hypnotize the Republican<br />\neon. vention delegates,<br />\nhe just isn't<br />\ning to pull the wool over 65 milsiOn American voters' eyes. Put<br />\n,R)r.tlY. Nixon hasn't sold a used<br />\n`ar m an awfully long time.<br />\nAl t has to be Rockefeller now.<br />\npoint to it, regardless of<br />\n\u00b0fliney's wishy-washy withdraw-<br /><br />\nal, Nixon's machine, or Rocky's<br />\nown reluctancy to act. Yet for<br />\nmany who looked at the GOP as<br />\nthe rostrum of hope and new vitality in the American political system year or so ago, it is depressing<br />\nto admit that the best the party<br />\nhas to offer is a super-Machiavelli<br />\nand a governor who just wants to<br />\nfade away peacefully. Where is the<br />\nvigor and excitement that John F.<br />\nKennedy brought to the political<br />\narena? What happened to the imaginative programs that would end<br />\npoverty and war? Is the Golden<br />\nAge of America behind us? At this<br />\neleventh hour in our history, Nelson A.
