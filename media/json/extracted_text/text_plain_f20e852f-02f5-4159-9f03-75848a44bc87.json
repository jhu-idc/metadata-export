The two last-named outlines<br />\nseparate it from the State of West Virginia.<br />\n<br />\nThis county is crossed by the ranges of the Alle-<br />\nghany Mountains, from which it takesits name. The<br />\ngeology is composed principally of sandstone and<br />\nlimestone, with quartz and slate. The most valuable<br />\nminerals are the vast coal-fields and iron-ore beds.<br />\nThe soil is of varying character of sand and clay, in<br />\nsome parts quite fertile, though mostly uncultivated,<br />\nand covered with natural forests. The waters of the<br />\ncounty are the North Branch of the Potomac, and<br />\nSavage River, and George\u2019s, Will\u2019s Town, and Fif-<br />\nteen Mile creeks, with many tributaries heading in<br />\nthe mountains, and all flowing into the Potomac.<br />\nThe western portion of the county is drained by the<br />\nBig and Little Youghiogheny rivers (commonly called<br />\nBig and Little Yough), with their numerous small<br />\ncreeks and branches, which empty into the Monon-<br />\ngahela and Ohio rivers.<br />\n<br />\nThe surface of Alleghany is broken and irregular,<br />\nthe greater part being on the mountains, and covered<br />\nwith the original forests of fine timbers, whilst be-<br />\ntween the mountain ridges are many broad and level<br />\nvalleys known as \u00a2 The Glades,\u201d which have in most<br />\ncases a rich deep soil, and are covered with excellent<br />\ngrasses, forming naturally very fine grazing lands,<br />\nand yielding large crops of hay. These lands also<br />\nmake good farms, producing all kinds of grain and<br />\nfine fruit.<br />\n<br />\nAlleghany possesses, in its immense coal-fields, the<br />\nmost valuable mineral deposits in the State, being<br />\nsuperior, in fact, to gold mines. There are three<br />\nlarge coal-fields: one in the Youghiogheny Valley,<br />\nanother along Meadow Mountain, neither of which is<br />\nused except for local purposes, having no outlet to a<br />\nmarket. The third is the \u201cGreat George\u2019s Creek\u201d<br />\nand Cumberland coal-field. This region, since the<br />\nconstruction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and<br />\nthe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, has been largely<br />\ndeveloped. The George\u2019s Creek, now Cumberland<br />\nand Pennsylvania Railroad, extends from Western-<br />\nport, on the Potomac, and the Baltimore and Ohio<br />\n<br />\n*If adopted by the people at the November election of 1872, the<br />\ncounty of Alleghany will be divided, and the western portion will<br />\nbe formed into a new county, and called \u00a2 Garrett.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nThe line of division commences on the north branch of the Po-<br />\ntomac, at the mouth of Savage River, and runs in a north-easterly<br />\ndirection to the summit of Savage Mountain, on the Pennsylvania<br />\nline.<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nRailroad, up George\u2019s Creck, and tunnelling the ridge<br />\nat Frostburg, then descends the sides of the moun-<br />\ntains by Mt. Savage to Cumberland. The Cumber-<br />\nland Coal and Iron Company\u2019s Railroad also connects<br />\ntheir mines with Cumberland. These two roads,<br />\nrunning directly from the mines, transport the coal<br />\nand deliver it to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,<br />\nand Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which bring it to<br />\nthe markets at Georgetown and Alexandria on the<br />\nPotomac, and to Baltimore. The products of these<br />\nmines have increased from a few thousand tons,<br />\ntwelve or fifteen years back, to an annual delivery<br />\nofnearly 1,000,000 tons with the present facilities, tax-<br />\ning the capacity of the two great sources of outlet,<br />\none of which, the canal, is generally closed four or<br />\nfive months in the year.<br />\n<br />\nThe coal produced is bituminous, burns very easily<br />\nand to a very light ash, having no slag or clinker. It<br />\nis excellent for blacksmithing, and unexcelled for<br />\nmanufacturing purposes generally, being the very<br />\nbest fuel for generating steam. The demand for<br />\nthis coal is always equal to or beyond the supply,<br />\nwhilst the extent of coal in this one field alone is<br />\nsuch, that it is estimated it would yield its present<br />\nannual supply for 4,000 years. :<br />\n<br />\nThis county has also large supplies of iron ores,<br />\nwhich are smelted in several large furnaces, many<br />\nundeveloped beds being a very fine description of<br />\nore. Also, excellent building material of limestone<br />\nand sandstone, and large quantities of hydraulic ce-<br />\nment, which is obtained very near to and prepared<br />\nfor market at Cumberland. Fire-brick clay of a<br />\nvery superior quality is found and manufactured in<br />\nimmense quantities at Mt. Savage Works.

At its northern extremity it lies<br />\nimmediately opposite to and is connected with<br />\nBaltimore city by a draw-bridge about a mile long.<br />\nIron ore abounds in the northern part of Anne<br />\nArundel.<br />\n<br />\nThis county is of a rolling character, but has no<br />\nvery elevated points, and, like most of the other coun-<br />\nties, has all descriptions of soil. Below Annapolis<br />\nthere is generally a stiffer soil, and mostly an excellent<br />\nfertile country, and very productive in tobacco and<br />\ngrain. The country between Annapolis and Balti-<br />\nmore is almost entirely cultivated in truck gardens,<br />\nand sends to the Baltimore markets a large propor-<br />\ntion of their finest supplies, producing immense<br />\nquantities of strawberries, peas, cucumbers, toma-<br />\ntoes, cantaloupes, water-melons, cabbages, &c. This<br />\nsection is highly adapted for this purpose, being<br />\nmostly a light soil, easily tilled, and, being protected<br />\nby the elevated lands north of Baltimore, is several<br />\ndays earlier in ripening crops than the soils around<br />\nthe north of the city. The timbers are principally<br />\noaks, chestnut, and pines. There are some fisheries<br />\nin the county though not very extensive, but oysters<br />\nabound around all the shores south from Sandy<br />\nPoint, and also wild fowl in the season.<br />\n<br />\nAnnapolis city is the county-seat, the capital of<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nMaryland, and the oldest city in the State, dating its<br />\norigin from the early days of the colony. It was,<br />\nuntil the Revolution, the largest city, and also pub-<br />\nlished the only newspaper in the State for the first<br />\nforty or fifty years of its existence. The United<br />\nStates Naval Academy having been located here<br />\nsome years back, the city took quite a start, and be-<br />\ncame quite renewed in appearance, and also increased<br />\nin population from 38,011 in 1850 to 4,529 in 1860,<br />\nand 5,744 in 1870. The city is pleasantly situated<br />\nnear the mouth of the Severn river, which is navi-<br />\ngable for large vessels several miles farther up.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE COUNTY is the most central of<br />\nthe northern tier of counties, and one of the largest<br />\nin the State, being bounded on the north by Penn-<br />\nsylvania, east by Harford County, west by Carroll<br />\nCounty, and southwest and south by the Patapsco<br />\nFalls and River, separating it from Howard and<br />\nAnne Arundel counties. This county, from its po-<br />\nsition surrounding the metropolis, is the most im-<br />\nportant in the State. The surface is uneven and<br />\nvaried, and the rivers and falls which traverse it<br />\nafford immense water-powers, and are the sites of<br />\nthe most extensive milling operations in the Union.<br />\nThe Little and Great Gunpowder Falls, Patapsco<br />\nRiver, and Gwynn\u2019s and Jones\u2019s Falls are improved<br />\nwith large carpet, cotton and woollen factories, fur-<br />\nnaces, foundries, paper and flouring mills, all doing<br />\na large and flourishing business. The finest and<br />\nstrongest cotton duck and the best flour are here<br />\nmanufactured. In many parts fruits are extensively<br />\ncultivated, and the vicinity of Baltimore is remark-<br />\nable for the fine quality and profusion of its garden<br />\nvegetables.<br />\n<br />\nIron ores of the brown hematite order, magnetic<br />\noxide, and carbonate species are found in many parts<br />\nof the county, and smelted in several furnaces.<br />\nCopper mines are worked at Bare Hills, about seven<br />\nmiles north of Baltimore; and near Bare Hills, and<br />\nsouthwest from Reisterstown, are very extensive beds<br />\nof chrome ore, yiclding a large proportion of that<br />\narticle produced by our State, which furnishes the<br />\nentire supply of chrome used in this country, and<br />\nmuch of that used in Europe.<br />\n<br />\nThe large beds of clay in the vicinity of Baltimore<br />\nhave always been celebrated for producing bricks<br />\nunequalled in the country for uniformity of color<br />\nand smoothness. This clay is also manufactured<br />\ninto stone-ware and earthen-ware. Beds of excel-<br />\nlent clay for fire-bricks also exist in the same vicinity.<br />\n<br />\nLarge quarries of fine building-stone are exten-<br />\nsively worked, affording good granite and gneiss, in<br />\nthe vicinity of Baltimore. In the neighborhood of<br />\nTexas and Cockeysville are unlimited quantities of<br />\nexcellent marble, the fine-grained white species used<br />\nfor the Capitol extension at Washington, and the<br />\nalum marble, well known from its use in the con-<br />\nstruction of the Patent Office at Washington. Large<br />\nquarries of limestone exist in many parts of the<br />\ncounty; a great quantity is burned at Texas. Lime<br />\nis abundant in Long Green, Dulany\u2019s, Green Spring,<br />\nWorthington, and other valleys, which valleys con-<br />\ntain some of the very finest and most productive<br />\nlands in the State.<br />\n<br />\nThere are some fisheries on the Bay shore, and<br />\nsome of the best points for shooting wild fowl. The<br />\ncounty is well provided with travelling facilities,<br />\nmost of the roads leaving the city are turnpikes,<br />\nwhilst all the railway routes also centre here. The<br />\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, running southwesterly<br />\nand westerly; the Western Maryland Railroad, north-<br />\nwesterly; the Northern Central extends the entire<br />\nlength of the county in a northern direction, and the<br />\nPhiladelphia Railroad toward the east.
