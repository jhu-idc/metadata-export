Schubel, director<br />\nof the Institute project,<br />\ncommented that for the most<br />\n<br />\npart, the bay has, perhaps<br />\nsurprisingly, returned to normal<br />\nsalinity levels.<br />\nSchubel further noted,\"Agnes<br />\nwas a major event geologically<br />\nspeaking in that it dumped<br />\nanywhere between 10 and 50<br />\nyears worth of sediment into the<br />\nBay in a single week.\"<br />\nDaily sediment concentration<br />\nsamplings taken at the<br />\nconfluence of the Susquehanna<br />\nand the upper Bay rarely<br />\nexceeded 400 parts per-million.<br />\nOn June 24, with the<br />\nSusquehanna swelling to it<br />\nhighest point, a phenomenal<br />\n10,000 parts per-million<br />\nconcentration was reported.<br />\nContinued research will attempt<br />\nto determine whether or not the<br />\nextraordinary quantities of<br />\nalluvium will become part of the<br />\nBay's permanent geologic record.<br />\nFlooding also resulted in the<br />\ncreation of some small islands<br />\nalong the Susquehanna flats.<br />\nThey are gradually disappearing.<br />\n\"The primary geological<br />\neffects of Agnes on the Bay were<br />\ndepositional, rather than<br />\nerosional as was the case with the<br />\ntributaries,\" explains Schubel. He<br />\nadded, \"Estuaries like the<br />\nChesapeake Bay are very<br />\nshort-lived on a geologic time<br />\n<br />\nscale.\" The gradual accumulation<br />\nof sediment eventually displaces<br />\nthe sea and reconverts the Bay<br />\ninto a river valley system.<br />\nSchubel estimates that in a single<br />\nweek Agnes aged the system one<br />\nhundred years.<br />\nThe effect of nutrients<br />\naccompanying the sediment on<br />\nthe biological system within the<br />\nBay will be the subject of further<br />\nstudy.

Unfortunately, as<br />\nadministrators admit, there is no long range planning<br />\ngoing on at Hopkins. For the centennial, the<br />\nUniversity's goal is simply to raise $100 million in new<br />\nendowment, to endow some professorships and<br />\nsupport some students. President Muller has stated<br />\nthat he wants a 4 per cent annual yield on endowment,<br />\na total of S4 million on the new funds, if they are ever<br />\nraised. With 3.5% inflation, that amount of income<br />\nwill quickly disappear, since the current budget is<br />\nalmost $100 million a year.

The<br />\nresultant real and dilusive madness which<br />\nhe displays for the next twenty years is<br />\nrevealed to be the center of the play.<br />\nThe mishap occurs in 1902, when the<br />\nyoung man,(known only in the play as<br />\nHenry IV), goes to a masquerade pageant.<br />\nFascinated by historical figures, he<br />\nchooses to don the costume of Henry IV,<br />\nan eleventh-century German emperor. His<br />\n<br />\nmasquerade goes much deeper than the<br />\nemperor's clothes, however, as his<br />\npreparation for the role includes a<br />\nmeticulous study of the life and events of<br />\nhis model. In the parade, Henry IV rides<br />\nbesides Matilda Spina, a woman with<br />\nwhom he is deeply in love. Ironically, she<br />\nhas chosen les vetements of Matilde<br />\nToscana, a notorious enemy of her<br />\nsuitor's historic personage.<br />\nMatilde rejects the approaches of her<br />\nyoung admirer, preferring instead the<br />\naffections of one Tito Bilaredi, who rides<br />\nbehind Henry in the pageatt.<br />\nDuring the horseback march, Henry's<br />\nmount suddenly rears, and he is thrown<br />\nto the ground. A blow to his head<br />\nproduces in him the insane notion that he<br />\nis the real Henry IV. When his malady<br />\nappears to be permanent, his friends use<br />\nhis wealth to provide him with the<br />\ncomplete illusion: a medieval castle and<br />\naccessory actors who serve as the<br />\nmadman's \"privy council.\"<br />\nThis much of Pirandello's story has<br />\noccured before the opening act of the<br />\n<br />\nplay.

She remembers clearly the<br />\nevening of the masquerade, and the<br />\nrejections with which she received<br />\nHenry's advances. She now regrets that<br />\nshe did not heed \"two eyes that look(ed)<br />\nat (me) with the promise of lasting<br />\naffection.\" She has seen this look many<br />\ntimes since that night, but none,<br />\nincluding Bilaredi's, seemed to be as<br />\nhonest and sincere as Henry's<br />\nLawrence Weinstein, as Bilaredi,<br />\n_portrays the villain of the play. Weinstein<br />\ncould easily be convicted of<br />\n'over-characterization, almost but not<br />\nquite to the point of detriment. His<br />\nabilities leave us no choice but to<br />\nrecognize Bilaredi as the antagonist, even<br />\nbefore we learn that it was his jealousy<br />\nthat caused Henry's horse to rear on that<br />\nfatal night.<br />\nDr. Genoni, as portrayed by Jon<br />\nNowick, is one of the production's<br />\nhighlights. Nowick's grasp of the<br />\npompous, self-sufficient Freudian is an<br />\nexcellent one, and is consistently<br />\ncomplimented by a decent German<br />\naccent.<br />\nPirandello builds the anticipation of his<br />\naudience by giving them their first<br />\n<br />\nfor twelve years following his fall, the last<br />\neight have been years of sanity. He has<br />\nmaintained the masquerade in order to<br />\navoid rejoining the reality which begins at<br />\nthe edges of his castle. After all, he asserts,<br />\nat his age, having tragically missed his period of societal joie devivre,it would be like<br />\n\"arriving with the hunger of a wolfe to a<br />\nbanquet already over.\"<br />\nShortly afterwards, Dr. Genoni sets up<br />\nhis shock treatment. From out of a dark<br />\ncorner of the castle emerge the costumed<br />\nMatilde and Frida. It is here that Waife's<br />\nHenry reaches his dramatic apex. He<br />\nstands, mouth agape, shuddering at the<br />\nsight and the thought of returned<br />\nmadness. Cilardi, to whom one of Henry's<br />\nconfidants has disclosed his feigned<br />\nmadness, calls Henry a fake.<br />\nHenry's story of previous recovery is<br />\nthen exposed, and the reason for his true<br />\nshock is made more obvious. He is<br />\noverwhelmed, however, by Frida's<br />\nresemblance to her mother's former<br />\nappearance, and he rushes to her, picks<br />\nher up and begins to carry her away,<br />\nclaiming, \"she's mine, she's mine!\"<br />\nBilaredi tries to aid the girl, but in a<br />\nfren of absolute madness Hen draws<br />\n<br />\nglimpse of Henry only Very late into the<br />\nfirst act. Of all the characters in the play,<br />\nmajor or minor, he is the last to be<br />\nintroduced.<br />\nRonald Waife, in the title role, is the<br />\ncomplete professional. Pirandello's<br />\ndisjointed madman monologues are<br />\nextremely difficult to perform<br />\ncompetently, and yet, Waife not only<br />\nmakes them sound convincing, but<br />\nseemingly, he does so with an absolute<br />\nminimum of effort.<br />\nAfter their first encounter with Henry,<br />\nMatilde et. al. take his situation to be one<br />\nof utmost urgency. Since Henry's mind is<br />\nchained to images of the past, Dr. Genoni<br />\nasserts, the shattering of those images will<br />\n<br />\nhis sword and mortally wounds him.<br />\nCompletely shattered by the<br />\nrealization that .what was only a<br />\nmasquerade, has resulted in murder,<br />\nHenry releases Frida, slowly walks to his<br />\nthrone, and quietly beckons his council<br />\nto gather round him.<br />\n\"Now, indeed,\" he whispers, \"there is<br />\nno other remedy.

And he realized that outside His sky was<br />\ndarkening, the clouds limp and soggy - they would try to<br />\nget in and escape the rain... and He cahnged the speed to<br />\nseventy-eight. There. That should fix them. Let them try<br />\nnow to escape.

There' was a feeling almost as exhilarating as<br />\necstasy, as eternal as joy, for there was still intact, the<br />\never-present, all seeing spindle, motionless, towards which<br />\nthey radiated like mutilated spokes: there... it may not cook<br />\nthem, but it might give them something to wonder about, to<br />\nspread a little formic over, to pass on the their progeny this great Realization.<br />\nBack down to thirty-three now.

Schubel, director<br />\nof the Institute project,<br />\ncommented that for the most<br /><br />\npart, the bay has, perhaps<br />\nsurprisingly, returned to normal<br />\nsalinity levels.<br />\nSchubel further noted,\"Agnes<br />\nwas a major event geologically<br />\nspeaking in that it dumped<br />\nanywhere between 10 and 50<br />\nyears worth of sediment into the<br />\nBay in a single week.\"<br />\nDaily sediment concentration<br />\nsamplings taken at the<br />\nconfluence of the Susquehanna<br />\nand the upper Bay rarely<br />\nexceeded 400 parts per-million.<br />\nOn June 24, with the<br />\nSusquehanna swelling to it<br />\nhighest point, a phenomenal<br />\n10,000 parts per-million<br />\nconcentration was reported.<br />\nContinued research will attempt<br />\nto determine whether or not the<br />\nextraordinary quantities of<br />\nalluvium will become part of the<br />\nBay's permanent geologic record.<br />\nFlooding also resulted in the<br />\ncreation of some small islands<br />\nalong the Susquehanna flats.<br />\nThey are gradually disappearing.<br />\n\"The primary geological<br />\neffects of Agnes on the Bay were<br />\ndepositional, rather than<br />\nerosional as was the case with the<br />\ntributaries,\" explains Schubel. He<br />\nadded, \"Estuaries like the<br />\nChesapeake Bay are very<br />\nshort-lived on a geologic time<br /><br />\nscale.\" The gradual accumulation<br />\nof sediment eventually displaces<br />\nthe sea and reconverts the Bay<br />\ninto a river valley system.<br />\nSchubel estimates that in a single<br />\nweek Agnes aged the system one<br />\nhundred years.<br />\nThe effect of nutrients<br />\naccompanying the sediment on<br />\nthe biological system within the<br />\nBay will be the subject of further<br />\nstudy.

The<br />\nresultant real and dilusive madness which<br />\nhe displays for the next twenty years is<br />\nrevealed to be the center of the play.<br />\nThe mishap occurs in 1902, when the<br />\nyoung man,(known only in the play as<br />\nHenry IV), goes to a masquerade pageant.<br />\nFascinated by historical figures, he<br />\nchooses to don the costume of Henry IV,<br />\nan eleventh-century German emperor. His<br /><br />\nmasquerade goes much deeper than the<br />\nemperor's clothes, however, as his<br />\npreparation for the role includes a<br />\nmeticulous study of the life and events of<br />\nhis model. In the parade, Henry IV rides<br />\nbesides Matilda Spina, a woman with<br />\nwhom he is deeply in love. Ironically, she<br />\nhas chosen les vetements of Matilde<br />\nToscana, a notorious enemy of her<br />\nsuitor's historic personage.<br />\nMatilde rejects the approaches of her<br />\nyoung admirer, preferring instead the<br />\naffections of one Tito Bilaredi, who rides<br />\nbehind Henry in the pageatt.<br />\nDuring the horseback march, Henry's<br />\nmount suddenly rears, and he is thrown<br />\nto the ground. A blow to his head<br />\nproduces in him the insane notion that he<br />\nis the real Henry IV. When his malady<br />\nappears to be permanent, his friends use<br />\nhis wealth to provide him with the<br />\ncomplete illusion: a medieval castle and<br />\naccessory actors who serve as the<br />\nmadman's \"privy council.\"<br />\nThis much of Pirandello's story has<br />\noccured before the opening act of the<br /><br />\nplay.

Weinstein<br />\ncould easily be convicted of<br />\n'over-characterization, almost but not<br />\nquite to the point of detriment. His<br />\nabilities leave us no choice but to<br />\nrecognize Bilaredi as the antagonist, even<br />\nbefore we learn that it was his jealousy<br />\nthat caused Henry's horse to rear on that<br />\nfatal night.<br />\nDr. Genoni, as portrayed by Jon<br />\nNowick, is one of the production's<br />\nhighlights.

He has<br />\nmaintained the masquerade in order to<br />\navoid rejoining the reality which begins at<br />\nthe edges of his castle. After all, he asserts,<br />\nat his age, having tragically missed his period of societal joie devivre,it would be like<br />\n\"arriving with the hunger of a wolfe to a<br />\nbanquet already over.\"<br />\nShortly afterwards, Dr. Genoni sets up<br />\nhis shock treatment. From out of a dark<br />\ncorner of the castle emerge the costumed<br />\nMatilde and Frida. It is here that Waife's<br />\nHenry reaches his dramatic apex.
