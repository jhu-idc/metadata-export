The total<br />\ngrant was $40,000. One of the<br />\nmajor problems was that there<br />\nwas no accounting made for the<br />\nfunds the group spent, neither<br />\nthe HEW grant nor the Hopkins<br />\nloan. Dr. Chester Wickwire, as<br />\none of the incorporators of<br />\nHouse Center, tried to get<br />\naccounting, but House Center<br />\nstaff members resisted, saying<br />\nthey were responsibIe only to<br />\nHEW. Some of the House Center<br />\nstaff was unwilling to mit up<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nwith what they considered<br />\nmeddling by Wickwire.

Doug Reid,<br />\nformer director of CODE and<br />\ndirector of House Center until<br />\nlast December, left for reasons<br />\nwhich differ depending on who is<br />\ntelling the story. One account has<br />\nit that he left due to<br />\ndissatisfaction with his leadership<br />\namong the staff while another<br />\nsays he left out of frustration<br />\nwith 'dealing with Wickwire.<br />\nWickwire would not discuss<br />\nReid's reasons for leaving. Reid<br />\nhimself said that he left in order<br />\nto come back to Hopkins.<br />\nAnd the dissension among the<br />\nstaff, according to Case, may<br />\nhamper the chances for the<br />\nprogram's reacceptance in<br />\nRemington.

The<br />\nStudent Council, plagued by diviseiveness, ineffiency<br />\nand immaturity during the first semester, seems to<br />\nhave put its many internal differences aside to do some<br />\ncreditable work on the governance issue. After what<br />\nmust be termed a highly successful referendum<br />\nconducted during registration, the SC last night added<br />\nits approval to the governance plan chosen by the<br />\nstudents and is now planning some very logical steps<br />\nwhich will hopefully see the plan through to adoption.<br />\nThough it still seems that a simpler University senate<br />\nidea, such as that proposed by George Owen and<br />\nRobert Strider several years ago, might have been a<br />\nbetter scheme to bF pushing, the SC's actions are the<br />\ntype necessary to assure improvement,<br />\nThe Medical Institutions, too, deserve some praise<br />\nthis week as their actions in response to what was<br />\nnearly a security crisis at the East Baltimore campus<br />\nseem to be well conceived and effective. Statistics<br />\n. e<br />\nshow that these reforms have cut sharply intocrim<br />\nBut another group at Homewood may be heading<br />\nfor trouble. The SAC seems to have taken the first<br />\nstep towards handing over budgetary control of<br />\nstudent organizations to the administration. Since<br />\nstudents are still going to be paying some sort of<br />\nactivities fee, it seems wise to let students continue to<br />\ndecide where the money goes.<br />\n<br />\nwith unpaid-for merchandise. The Center's undercover<br />\nagents seem to have paid off in reclaimed stolen<br />\narticles<br />\nTwo weeks ago, an undergraduate found the<br />\nbookstore ripping off students. They had over-priced a<br />\ntextbook, and violated Nixon's Phase II control. This<br />\nviolation of the law is as much a crime as stealing.<br />\nBut not only were they violating the law, they were<br />\nviolating the trust placed in them by the rest of the<br />\nUniversity. The Book Center is the only outlet in the<br />\nHomewood vicinity that deals with texts for Hopkins<br />\ncourses; therefore, they control a virtual monopoly.<br />\nStudents have found themselves at the mercy of the<br />\nCenter's judgement and it seems that their lack of<br />\ndiscretion may have been sorely felt in the back<br />\npocket of the Hopkins community.<br />\nRegaining the students' trust is important to all<br />\nsectors of the University. The bookstore now faces this<br />\ntask. Paul Chew, the undergraduate who found the<br />\nCenter hiking their prices illegally, had made a valid<br />\nsuggestion. He proposes that the management of the<br />\nBook Center disclose the invoices they recieve from<br />\nthe publishers. This will allow the students to compare<br />\nthe wholesale and retail prices of the goods they are<br />\nbuying, and also provide a check on the Center's price<br />\nhiking.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis letter is intended as a statement<br />\nof facts concerning the matter of Mr.<br />\nRobert Belsky and the fencing team.

We<br />\nfeel however that only if the situation is<br />\nfully understood can any discussion or<br />\naction take place.<br />\n1. The \"appearance code,\" as it has<br />\ncome to be called, was originally<br />\nofficially adopted by the varsity team of<br />\n1967. Since then, it has undergone many<br />\nmodifications and changes.<br />\n2. In regards to the meeting in which<br />\nthe varsity \"adopted the coach's original<br />\nrules,\" this statement is untrue. The<br />\nvarsity modified the rule to conform with<br />\nthe new NCAA rule (passed by the<br />\nNCAA Rules Committee in July, 1971, it<br />\ntakes effect with the next printing of the<br />\nrules bOok) which states that nothing<br />\nshall obscure the foil fencer's target.

In regards to the statement that<br />\nCoach Oles reversed the decision of the<br />\njv, this is true, but he did so at the urging<br />\nof the two co-captains and members of<br />\nthe varsity team. The team strongly<br />\nadvised Coach Oles to take the action<br />\nwhich he did.<br />\n\u2022 4. Finally, Mr. Belsky charges that the<br />\nimplementation of this code is solely<br />\ntarried out by Mr. Oles. This is again<br />\nuntrue. The two co-captains and the<br />\ncoach have formed an ad hoc three man<br />\n. panel whenever the question has come<br />\nup.

Along with<br />\nSurrenmatt, Frisch is largely responsible<br />\nfor the rise of drama in Switzerland to a<br />\nposition of international importance. In<br />\n<br />\nHouse Center<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI have been following with interest the<br />\narticles by Richard Waring on The House<br />\nCenter, Inc., and I feel that it is necessary<br />\nto say a few things for the Committee on<br />\nDrug Education (CODE).<br />\nCODE was founded in 1969 after an<br />\non-campus drug arrest to provide<br />\ninteresting and accurav! information on<br />\nall aspects of drugs. The House Center<br />\nwas to be CODE's attempt at reaching<br />\nthe community.

His two most well known Novels,<br />\n\"I'm Not Stiller,\" and \"Homo Faber,\"<br />\nhave been translated into English. His<br />\nfirst play to receive wide acclaim outside<br />\nhis native Switzerland was the \"Chinese<br />\nWall,\" which was presented at Center<br />\nStage in 1965. The \"Firebugs\" was also<br />\nwell received abroad and had an<br />\nOff-Broadway production under the<br />\ndirection of Frankel.<br />\n\"Andorra\" is Frisch's most widely<br />\nperformed work. It premiered in Zurich<br />\n-1962 was playing in 53<br />\nin 1961, and by<br />\ncities throughout Germany and in 16<br />\nother countries. \"Andorra\" is a two-act<br />\ndrama set in a mythical country bearing a<br />\ncurious spiritual resemblance to Frisch's<br />\nestimation of Switzerland. The play<br />\nfocuses on Andri, a 20 year-old boy, who<br />\n<br />\nqt.<br />\n<br />\nstatt of the Xast. semestet, The 1-kouse<br />\nwith its original educational purpose and<br />\nhas not been succeeded by The House<br />\n<br />\n-10 WC1.COM<br />\nBACK AT<br />\nGREAT EXPEUSE-<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nPATNI<br />\n<br />\nFara,<br />\n<br />\nthe time Andri learns he is actually not a<br />\nJew, he cannot accept this truth\u2014for by<br />\nnow, he feels and is a Jew.<br />\n\"Andorra\" is ostensibly a play about<br />\nanti-Semitism and the emptiness of man's<br />\nvirtues, but at a deeper level it is<br />\nconcerned with the sensitive problem of<br />\nthe search for identity in a society that is<br />\nconstantly imposing images and identities<br />\nupon us. Mr. Frisch explained: \"It<br />\n[Andorra]says that we tend to tit the<br />\nimage that other people have of us. We<br />\ncannot accept ourselves as ourselves, but<br />\nonly as others think of us.\"<br />\nAn extremely intense, and at some<br />\npoints, an emotionally gripping, drama,<br />\n\"Andorra\" should be seen and<br />\nappreciated as a good example of a play<br />\nthat utilizes the Brecht notion of<br />\ntheatrical alienation. Just as Frisch<br />\nintended, one never becomes too<br />\nemotionally involved. You are constantly<br />\nreflecting and analyzing yourself and<br />\nyour own prejudices and identity. Frisch<br />\nhas stated, \"I don't think plays<br />\nshould crte an illusion, but allow you<br />\nSocial Implications<br />\n<br />\nThe play, although quite slow moving<br />\nand somewhat dull in the first act,<br />\nemphatically drives home the present-day<br />\nsocial implications that Frisch intended,<br />\nand the pick-up in tempo and the action<br />\nin the scenes of the final act, were well<br />\nworth waiting for. The role of Andri, the<br />\n\"Jew,\" played by Matthew Anden, was<br />\nclearly the most emotionally demanding<br />\nand difficult, and Anden performed<br />\nadmirably. \"Andorra' will be playing at<br />\nCenter Stage through Sunday, Feb. 27.<br />\n<br />\nHaussner's pleases every taste<br />\n<br />\nHaussner's, long considered one of<br />\nBaltimore's finest and most unusual<br />\nrestaurants, has been owned and operated<br />\nby the Haussner family since 1926.

The<br />\nproject is the<br />\nproposed eastNEWS<br />\nwest expressway<br />\nthat would cut<br />\nANALYSIS through the southern half of the<br />\ncity, and cross<br />\nBaltimore harbor. It promises<br />\nto cost the city dearly in money<br />\nand in citizen opposition.<br />\nThe idea for the expressway<br />\ngoes back for over thirty years.<br />\nIts justification lies in the beliefs<br />\nthat it would relieve the entire<br />\nport area of truck traffic, and<br />\nwould make it easier for<br />\ncommuters to get to and from<br />\nthe downtown area.<br />\nThe proposed route would<br />\ncarry the road through Leakin<br />\nPark, Gwynns Falls Park, Fells<br />\nPoint; Ft. McHenry, the Harbor,<br />\nand then Canton and East Falls.<br />\nThe road may be tunneled under<br />\nthe harbor.<br />\nThe financing of the project<br />\npromises to place the city, and<br />\npossibly the state,into a serious<br />\n<br />\nSPECIAL<br />\nNOTICE<br />\nStudent<br />\nand<br />\nFaculty<br />\nDiscounts<br />\nON<br />\nGoodyear Tires<br />\nGates Tires<br />\nRecapped Tires<br />\nMonarch Tires<br />\n<br />\nauto repairs<br />\nBrakes<br />\nAlignment<br />\nTune-Up<br />\nGrease & Oil Change<br />\nShock Absorbers<br />\nMufflers<br />\nAnti-Freeze<br />\nWheels<br />\n<br />\nfinancial bind. According to Dr.<br />\nSherry Olsen, Geography and<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering, $100<br />\nmillion has already been spent on<br />\nthe project, most of it used to<br />\nraze the Franklin-Mulberry<br />\ncorridor, which is no longer on<br />\nthe route. Another $100 million<br />\nhas already been committed by<br />\ncontract. According to a Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate doing research on<br />\nthe project, the final cost will be<br />\nin the neighborhood of<br />\n$1,041,000,000, of which about<br />\n84% will be paid for by the<br />\nFederal Highway Trust Fund.<br />\nThe city will have to pay close to<br />\n$2 1 3,000,000, of which $35<br />\nmillion will come from the state.<br />\nThe question arises as to when.<br />\nthe city, described as \"broke\" by<br />\nWalter Orlinsky, will get the<br />\nmoney. Such a sum cannot be<br />\nraised through taxes, so a bond<br />\nissue will have to be floated.<br />\nDepending on the rate of<br />\n<br />\ninterest, the city would have to<br />\npay out an additional 85-10<br />\nmillion a year.<br />\nThe project is opposed by<br />\nseveral citizens' coalitions<br />\nnotably MAD (Movement<br />\nAgainst Destruction), and<br />\nVOLPE (Volunteers Opposed to<br />\nthe L,eakin Park Expressway).<br />\nMrs. Carolyn Tyson of MAD<br />\ncontended that the expressway<br />\nwould only serve the interests of<br />\nthe truckers who operate in the<br />\nport, and of the powerful<br />\nhighway lobby on Capitol Hill.<br />\ncaid Mrs. Tyson, \"There is<br />\nabsolutely no question about it.<br />\nThe expressway is a pure special<br />\ninterest boondoggle. There is no<br />\nway that they can even contend<br />\nthat it will be for the good of the<br />\npeople. There are too few<br />\nentrances and exits, and the<br />\nobvious traffic and parking<br />\nproblems will only hinder access<br />\ninto the downtown area. The<br />\n<br />\ntruckers would actually prefer a<br />\nnorth-south route, but' that is<br />\npolitically impossible.\"<br />\nAesthetically Unsound<br />\nMany object to the expressway<br />\non aesthetic grounds. Said Mrs.<br />\nTyson, \"The road would ruin<br />\nLeakin Park.\" Dr. Olson objects<br />\nto the desecration of Fells Point.<br />\nThe harbor crossing can be<br />\naccomplished either by bridge or<br />\ntunnel. A bridge would pass near<br />\nFt. McHenry, Baltimore's major<br />\ntourist attraction. A tunnel,<br />\naccording to a Hopkins student<br />\nworking on the project, would<br />\ntake nearly five years to<br />\ncomplete, and would create a<br />\ngreat inconvenience in the<br />\nmeantime.<br />\nAll sources agree that the basis<br />\nof the problem is the large<br />\namounts of federal money<br />\navailable. Said Dr. Olsen, \"The<br />\ncity would never have torn up<br />\n<br />\ntile Franklin-Mulberry corridor<br />\nwith its own money.\" Mrs. Tyson<br />\ntended to be a bit more opposed<br />\nto the Federal Highway Trust<br />\nFund and the Highway Lobby.<br />\nThe Fund annually collects<br />\nalmost $6 billion, almost all of<br />\nwhich goes into the financing of<br />\nnew roads. Thus the highway<br />\nindustry in guaranteed a constant<br />\nsource of money to build roads<br />\nwith. And, as Mrs. Tyson<br />\ncomplained bitterly, it often has<br />\nto look for places to build them.<br />\nFull of Mischief<br />\nIn addition to the east-west<br />\nexpressway, plans are afloat for<br />\nthe completion of the beltway<br />\naround the eastern half of the<br />\nharbor, and for a 4.5 mile<br />\nextension of the Jones Falls<br />\nexpressway. These roads will cost<br />\n$20 million a mile to build.

The<br />\nJays were never really in the<br />\ngame after the first ten minutes<br />\nof play. By then, the Drexel lead<br />\nhad grown to 11, only to grow<br />\nlarger as the game progressed.<br />\nIt was a combination of poor<br />\nshooting and weak defense by<br />\nHopkins, that provided the<br />\ndifference in the contest.<br />\nThroughout the entire 20<br />\nminutes, the Drexel guards time<br />\nand again drove<br />\ne lane<br />\npractically uncontested<br />\nThe Blue Jays, who shot only<br />\n37%, connected on just 25 of 67<br />\nshots. It was un doubtedly one of<br />\ntheir worst shooting nights of the<br />\n<br />\nseason. Even the free throw<br />\nshooting was sub-par. Usually<br />\nshooting at least 80% from the<br />\nfree throw stripe, the Jays<br />\ncould manage only 14 of<br />\n19 attempts for 73%. Drexel, on<br />\nthe other hand, shot a hot 61%<br />\nfrom the field and 79% from the<br />\nline.<br />\nLeading Scorers<br />\nThe leading scorers for<br />\nHopkins were Gary Handleman<br />\nand Bill Jews, who contributed<br />\n23 and 17 points respectively in<br />\nthe losing effort. Jews led the<br />\nrebounding for Hopkins with 11,<br />\nmost of them coming in the first<br />\nhalf.<br />\nWhile the Blue Jays did stay<br />\nclose in the early going, the<br />\nteams went to the dressing rooms<br />\nfor halftime with Drexel out in<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nspo<br />\n<br />\nfront, 37-24.<br />\nAt the start of the second half,<br />\nthe deficit was closed to ten,<br />\n37-27. But after that, it was all<br />\nDrexel. For most of the rest of<br />\nthe half, the lead volleyed<br />\nbetween a comfortable 15 to 20<br />\npoints.<br />\nHopkins was never able to pull<br />\nback into the game.. With 5:00<br />\nminute remaining. Drexel was<br />\nsafely on top, 74-54. The Drexel<br />\ncoach then began substituting,<br />\nbut the tired Blue Jays could<br />\npick up no ground on the<br />\nenthusiastic Drexel subs. When<br />\nthe buzzer sounded; Hopkins<br />\ntrailed by 25,89-64.<br />\nIt should be noted that the<br />\nDrexel basketball team plays in<br />\nthe tough MAC University<br />\ndivision.

The total<br />\ngrant was $40,000. One of the<br />\nmajor problems was that there<br />\nwas no accounting made for the<br />\nfunds the group spent, neither<br />\nthe HEW grant nor the Hopkins<br />\nloan. Dr. Chester Wickwire, as<br />\none of the incorporators of<br />\nHouse Center, tried to get<br />\naccounting, but House Center<br />\nstaff members resisted, saying<br />\nthey were responsibIe only to<br />\nHEW. Some of the House Center<br />\nstaff was unwilling to mit up<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nwith what they considered<br />\nmeddling by Wickwire. He asked<br />\nquestions about their moves first<br />\nfrom Remington to 3036<br />\nGuilford and then to<br />\nReisterstown after several<br />\nrobberies.<br />\nBut Jim Case, a community<br />\nworker in the Remington area,<br />\nsaid, \"Blaming Wickwire for the<br />\nfailure . of the project is<br />\nscapegoating.

Doug Reid,<br />\nformer director of CODE and<br />\ndirector of House Center until<br />\nlast December, left for reasons<br />\nwhich differ depending on who is<br />\ntelling the story. One account has<br />\nit that he left due to<br />\ndissatisfaction with his leadership<br />\namong the staff while another<br />\nsays he left out of frustration<br />\nwith 'dealing with Wickwire.<br />\nWickwire would not discuss<br />\nReid's reasons for leaving. Reid<br />\nhimself said that he left in order<br />\nto come back to Hopkins.<br />\nAnd the dissension among the<br />\nstaff, according to Case, may<br />\nhamper the chances for the<br />\nprogram's reacceptance in<br />\nRemington.

Paul<br />\nChew, a Hopkins student, had<br />\nPreviously initiated an: Internal<br />\nRevenue Service investigation to<br />\nexamine violations at the Center.<br />\nAccording to Chew, the<br />\nInvestigation was ineffectual due<br />\nto the inefficiency of the I.R.S.<br />\nChew said that he had<br />\ninformed the Internal Revenue<br />\nand asked for an investigation<br />\nbecause of an illigal violation of<br />\nPhase II that he had been witness<br />\nto during the minimester.<br />\n\"Two calculus books were on<br />\nthe shelves side by side.

The<br />\nStudent Council, plagued by diviseiveness, ineffiency<br />\nand immaturity during the first semester, seems to<br />\nhave put its many internal differences aside to do some<br />\ncreditable work on the governance issue. After what<br />\nmust be termed a highly successful referendum<br />\nconducted during registration, the SC last night added<br />\nits approval to the governance plan chosen by the<br />\nstudents and is now planning some very logical steps<br />\nwhich will hopefully see the plan through to adoption.<br />\nThough it still seems that a simpler University senate<br />\nidea, such as that proposed by George Owen and<br />\nRobert Strider several years ago, might have been a<br />\nbetter scheme to bF pushing, the SC's actions are the<br />\ntype necessary to assure improvement,<br />\nThe Medical Institutions, too, deserve some praise<br />\nthis week as their actions in response to what was<br />\nnearly a security crisis at the East Baltimore campus<br />\nseem to be well conceived and effective. Statistics<br />\n. e<br />\nshow that these reforms have cut sharply intocrim<br />\nBut another group at Homewood may be heading<br />\nfor trouble. The SAC seems to have taken the first<br />\nstep towards handing over budgetary control of<br />\nstudent organizations to the administration. Since<br />\nstudents are still going to be paying some sort of<br />\nactivities fee, it seems wise to let students continue to<br />\ndecide where the money goes.<br /><br />\nwith unpaid-for merchandise. The Center's undercover<br />\nagents seem to have paid off in reclaimed stolen<br />\narticles<br />\nTwo weeks ago, an undergraduate found the<br />\nbookstore ripping off students. They had over-priced a<br />\ntextbook, and violated Nixon's Phase II control. This<br />\nviolation of the law is as much a crime as stealing.<br />\nBut not only were they violating the law, they were<br />\nviolating the trust placed in them by the rest of the<br />\nUniversity. The Book Center is the only outlet in the<br />\nHomewood vicinity that deals with texts for Hopkins<br />\ncourses; therefore, they control a virtual monopoly.<br />\nStudents have found themselves at the mercy of the<br />\nCenter's judgement and it seems that their lack of<br />\ndiscretion may have been sorely felt in the back<br />\npocket of the Hopkins community.<br />\nRegaining the students' trust is important to all<br />\nsectors of the University. The bookstore now faces this<br />\ntask. Paul Chew, the undergraduate who found the<br />\nCenter hiking their prices illegally, had made a valid<br />\nsuggestion. He proposes that the management of the<br />\nBook Center disclose the invoices they recieve from<br />\nthe publishers.

It is<br />\nintended only as a statement of<br />\nfacts\u2014facts which were either omitted or<br />\nunclear in Mr. Belsky's letter. This letter<br />\ndoes not attempt to take a position. We<br />\nfeel however that only if the situation is<br />\nfully understood can any discussion or<br />\naction take place.<br />\n1. The \"appearance code,\" as it has<br />\ncome to be called, was originally<br />\nofficially adopted by the varsity team of<br />\n1967. Since then, it has undergone many<br />\nmodifications and changes.<br />\n2. In regards to the meeting in which<br />\nthe varsity \"adopted the coach's original<br />\nrules,\" this statement is untrue. The<br />\nvarsity modified the rule to conform with<br />\nthe new NCAA rule (passed by the<br />\nNCAA Rules Committee in July, 1971, it<br />\ntakes effect with the next printing of the<br />\nrules bOok) which states that nothing<br />\nshall obscure the foil fencer's target.

In regards to the statement that<br />\nCoach Oles reversed the decision of the<br />\njv, this is true, but he did so at the urging<br />\nof the two co-captains and members of<br />\nthe varsity team. The team strongly<br />\nadvised Coach Oles to take the action<br />\nwhich he did.<br />\n\u2022 4. Finally, Mr. Belsky charges that the<br />\nimplementation of this code is solely<br />\ntarried out by Mr. Oles. This is again<br />\nuntrue. The two co-captains and the<br />\ncoach have formed an ad hoc three man<br />\n. panel whenever the question has come<br />\nup. The majority vote of this group is the<br />\naction taken by Mr. Oles.

Along with<br />\nSurrenmatt, Frisch is largely responsible<br />\nfor the rise of drama in Switzerland to a<br />\nposition of international importance. In<br /><br />\nHouse Center<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI have been following with interest the<br />\narticles by Richard Waring on The House<br />\nCenter, Inc., and I feel that it is necessary<br />\nto say a few things for the Committee on<br />\nDrug Education (CODE).<br />\nCODE was founded in 1969 after an<br />\non-campus drug arrest to provide<br />\ninteresting and accurav! information on<br />\nall aspects of drugs. The House Center<br />\nwas to be CODE's attempt at reaching<br />\nthe community.

His two most well known Novels,<br />\n\"I'm Not Stiller,\" and \"Homo Faber,\"<br />\nhave been translated into English. His<br />\nfirst play to receive wide acclaim outside<br />\nhis native Switzerland was the \"Chinese<br />\nWall,\" which was presented at Center<br />\nStage in 1965. The \"Firebugs\" was also<br />\nwell received abroad and had an<br />\nOff-Broadway production under the<br />\ndirection of Frankel.<br />\n\"Andorra\" is Frisch's most widely<br />\nperformed work. It premiered in Zurich<br />\n-1962 was playing in 53<br />\nin 1961, and by<br />\ncities throughout Germany and in 16<br />\nother countries. \"Andorra\" is a two-act<br />\ndrama set in a mythical country bearing a<br />\ncurious spiritual resemblance to Frisch's<br />\nestimation of Switzerland. The play<br />\nfocuses on Andri, a 20 year-old boy, who<br /><br />\nqt.<br /><br />\nstatt of the Xast. semestet, The 1-kouse<br />\nwith its original educational purpose and<br />\nhas not been succeeded by The House<br /><br />\n-10 WC1.COM<br />\nBACK AT<br />\nGREAT EXPEUSE-<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nPATNI<br /><br />\nFara,<br /><br />\nthe time Andri learns he is actually not a<br />\nJew, he cannot accept this truth\u2014for by<br />\nnow, he feels and is a Jew.<br />\n\"Andorra\" is ostensibly a play about<br />\nanti-Semitism and the emptiness of man's<br />\nvirtues, but at a deeper level it is<br />\nconcerned with the sensitive problem of<br />\nthe search for identity in a society that is<br />\nconstantly imposing images and identities<br />\nupon us. Mr. Frisch explained: \"It<br />\n[Andorra]says that we tend to tit the<br />\nimage that other people have of us. We<br />\ncannot accept ourselves as ourselves, but<br />\nonly as others think of us.\"<br />\nAn extremely intense, and at some<br />\npoints, an emotionally gripping, drama,<br />\n\"Andorra\" should be seen and<br />\nappreciated as a good example of a play<br />\nthat utilizes the Brecht notion of<br />\ntheatrical alienation. Just as Frisch<br />\nintended, one never becomes too<br />\nemotionally involved. You are constantly<br />\nreflecting and analyzing yourself and<br />\nyour own prejudices and identity. Frisch<br />\nhas stated, \"I don't think plays<br />\nshould crte an illusion, but allow you<br />\nSocial Implications<br /><br />\nThe play, although quite slow moving<br />\nand somewhat dull in the first act,<br />\nemphatically drives home the present-day<br />\nsocial implications that Frisch intended,<br />\nand the pick-up in tempo and the action<br />\nin the scenes of the final act, were well<br />\nworth waiting for. The role of Andri, the<br />\n\"Jew,\" played by Matthew Anden, was<br />\nclearly the most emotionally demanding<br />\nand difficult, and Anden performed<br />\nadmirably. \"Andorra' will be playing at<br />\nCenter Stage through Sunday, Feb. 27.<br /><br />\nHaussner's pleases every taste<br /><br />\nHaussner's, long considered one of<br />\nBaltimore's finest and most unusual<br />\nrestaurants, has been owned and operated<br />\nby the Haussner family since 1926.

The list of<br />\nentrees is equally impressive with a<br />\npredomination of beef and seafood. As<br />\nwith most Baltimore restaurants one need<br />\nnot stray from the seafood Specialties of<br />\nthe house.

The<br />\nproject is the<br />\nproposed eastNEWS<br />\nwest expressway<br />\nthat would cut<br />\nANALYSIS through the southern half of the<br />\ncity, and cross<br />\nBaltimore harbor. It promises<br />\nto cost the city dearly in money<br />\nand in citizen opposition.<br />\nThe idea for the expressway<br />\ngoes back for over thirty years.<br />\nIts justification lies in the beliefs<br />\nthat it would relieve the entire<br />\nport area of truck traffic, and<br />\nwould make it easier for<br />\ncommuters to get to and from<br />\nthe downtown area.<br />\nThe proposed route would<br />\ncarry the road through Leakin<br />\nPark, Gwynns Falls Park, Fells<br />\nPoint; Ft. McHenry, the Harbor,<br />\nand then Canton and East Falls.<br />\nThe road may be tunneled under<br />\nthe harbor.<br />\nThe financing of the project<br />\npromises to place the city, and<br />\npossibly the state,into a serious<br /><br />\nSPECIAL<br />\nNOTICE<br />\nStudent<br />\nand<br />\nFaculty<br />\nDiscounts<br />\nON<br />\nGoodyear Tires<br />\nGates Tires<br />\nRecapped Tires<br />\nMonarch Tires<br /><br />\nauto repairs<br />\nBrakes<br />\nAlignment<br />\nTune-Up<br />\nGrease &amp; Oil Change<br />\nShock Absorbers<br />\nMufflers<br />\nAnti-Freeze<br />\nWheels<br /><br />\nfinancial bind. According to Dr.<br />\nSherry Olsen, Geography and<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering, $100<br />\nmillion has already been spent on<br />\nthe project, most of it used to<br />\nraze the Franklin-Mulberry<br />\ncorridor, which is no longer on<br />\nthe route. Another $100 million<br />\nhas already been committed by<br />\ncontract. According to a Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate doing research on<br />\nthe project, the final cost will be<br />\nin the neighborhood of<br />\n$1,041,000,000, of which about<br />\n84% will be paid for by the<br />\nFederal Highway Trust Fund.<br />\nThe city will have to pay close to<br />\n$2 1 3,000,000, of which $35<br />\nmillion will come from the state.<br />\nThe question arises as to when.<br />\nthe city, described as \"broke\" by<br />\nWalter Orlinsky, will get the<br />\nmoney. Such a sum cannot be<br />\nraised through taxes, so a bond<br />\nissue will have to be floated.<br />\nDepending on the rate of<br /><br />\ninterest, the city would have to<br />\npay out an additional 85-10<br />\nmillion a year.<br />\nThe project is opposed by<br />\nseveral citizens' coalitions<br />\nnotably MAD (Movement<br />\nAgainst Destruction), and<br />\nVOLPE (Volunteers Opposed to<br />\nthe L,eakin Park Expressway).<br />\nMrs. Carolyn Tyson of MAD<br />\ncontended that the expressway<br />\nwould only serve the interests of<br />\nthe truckers who operate in the<br />\nport, and of the powerful<br />\nhighway lobby on Capitol Hill.<br />\ncaid Mrs. Tyson, \"There is<br />\nabsolutely no question about it.<br />\nThe expressway is a pure special<br />\ninterest boondoggle. There is no<br />\nway that they can even contend<br />\nthat it will be for the good of the<br />\npeople. There are too few<br />\nentrances and exits, and the<br />\nobvious traffic and parking<br />\nproblems will only hinder access<br />\ninto the downtown area. The<br /><br />\ntruckers would actually prefer a<br />\nnorth-south route, but' that is<br />\npolitically impossible.\"<br />\nAesthetically Unsound<br />\nMany object to the expressway<br />\non aesthetic grounds. Said Mrs.<br />\nTyson, \"The road would ruin<br />\nLeakin Park.\" Dr. Olson objects<br />\nto the desecration of Fells Point.<br />\nThe harbor crossing can be<br />\naccomplished either by bridge or<br />\ntunnel. A bridge would pass near<br />\nFt. McHenry, Baltimore's major<br />\ntourist attraction. A tunnel,<br />\naccording to a Hopkins student<br />\nworking on the project, would<br />\ntake nearly five years to<br />\ncomplete, and would create a<br />\ngreat inconvenience in the<br />\nmeantime.<br />\nAll sources agree that the basis<br />\nof the problem is the large<br />\namounts of federal money<br />\navailable. Said Dr. Olsen, \"The<br />\ncity would never have torn up<br /><br />\ntile Franklin-Mulberry corridor<br />\nwith its own money.\" Mrs. Tyson<br />\ntended to be a bit more opposed<br />\nto the Federal Highway Trust<br />\nFund and the Highway Lobby.<br />\nThe Fund annually collects<br />\nalmost $6 billion, almost all of<br />\nwhich goes into the financing of<br />\nnew roads. Thus the highway<br />\nindustry in guaranteed a constant<br />\nsource of money to build roads<br />\nwith. And, as Mrs. Tyson<br />\ncomplained bitterly, it often has<br />\nto look for places to build them.<br />\nFull of Mischief<br />\nIn addition to the east-west<br />\nexpressway, plans are afloat for<br />\nthe completion of the beltway<br />\naround the eastern half of the<br />\nharbor, and for a 4.5 mile<br />\nextension of the Jones Falls<br />\nexpressway. These roads will cost<br />\n$20 million a mile to build. Said<br />\nMrs. Tyson, \"When the city is<br />\npaved over, it will be very easy to<br />\nget out of it.\"<br /><br />\nDo you think \u2022<br />\na bright young<br />\nElectronics Engineer<br />\nshould spend<br />\nhis most imaginative years on<br />\nthe same assignment?<br />\nNeither do we.<br />\nThat's why we have a twoyear Rotation Program for<br />\ngraduating engineers who<br />\nwould prefer to explore several<br />\ntechnical areas.

The<br />\nJays were never really in the<br />\ngame after the first ten minutes<br />\nof play. By then, the Drexel lead<br />\nhad grown to 11, only to grow<br />\nlarger as the game progressed.<br />\nIt was a combination of poor<br />\nshooting and weak defense by<br />\nHopkins, that provided the<br />\ndifference in the contest.<br />\nThroughout the entire 20<br />\nminutes, the Drexel guards time<br />\nand again drove<br />\ne lane<br />\npractically uncontested<br />\nThe Blue Jays, who shot only<br />\n37%, connected on just 25 of 67<br />\nshots. It was un doubtedly one of<br />\ntheir worst shooting nights of the<br /><br />\nseason. Even the free throw<br />\nshooting was sub-par. Usually<br />\nshooting at least 80% from the<br />\nfree throw stripe, the Jays<br />\ncould manage only 14 of<br />\n19 attempts for 73%. Drexel, on<br />\nthe other hand, shot a hot 61%<br />\nfrom the field and 79% from the<br />\nline.<br />\nLeading Scorers<br />\nThe leading scorers for<br />\nHopkins were Gary Handleman<br />\nand Bill Jews, who contributed<br />\n23 and 17 points respectively in<br />\nthe losing effort. Jews led the<br />\nrebounding for Hopkins with 11,<br />\nmost of them coming in the first<br />\nhalf.<br />\nWhile the Blue Jays did stay<br />\nclose in the early going, the<br />\nteams went to the dressing rooms<br />\nfor halftime with Drexel out in<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nspo<br /><br />\nfront, 37-24.<br />\nAt the start of the second half,<br />\nthe deficit was closed to ten,<br />\n37-27. But after that, it was all<br />\nDrexel. For most of the rest of<br />\nthe half, the lead volleyed<br />\nbetween a comfortable 15 to 20<br />\npoints.<br />\nHopkins was never able to pull<br />\nback into the game.. With 5:00<br />\nminute remaining. Drexel was<br />\nsafely on top, 74-54. The Drexel<br />\ncoach then began substituting,<br />\nbut the tired Blue Jays could<br />\npick up no ground on the<br />\nenthusiastic Drexel subs. When<br />\nthe buzzer sounded; Hopkins<br />\ntrailed by 25,89-64.<br />\nIt should be noted that the<br />\nDrexel basketball team plays in<br />\nthe tough MAC University<br />\ndivision. This is a team that lost<br />\nto Temple earlier in the season<br />\nby only 6 points. The Blue Jays<br />\nwere simply outmanned in this<br />\none.
