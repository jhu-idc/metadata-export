Cranston, an<br />\nardent opponent of the bill<br />\nremarked,\"I opposed and continue to oppose giving guns to<br />\ngroups that are, in effect, terrorists working to overthrow<br />\nforeign governments.\"<br />\nHe added, \"I don't believe<br />\nwe should ever try to overthrow<br />\nforeign governments unless<br />\nthey pose a very real direct<br />\nthreat to us. And certainly little Nicaragua, hundreds of<br />\nmiles away, with only 3 million<br />\npeople, poses no real threat to<br />\nour nation.\"<br />\nCranston continued, \"By<br />\npassing that bill tonight, we<br />\nmay have unfortunately begun<br />\nthe same course of actions that<br />\ngot us in Viet Nam; first giving<br />\nmoney, then sending advisors,<br />\nthen after an incident like the<br />\nGulf of Tonkin happens<br />\nbecoming directly involved<br />\nmilitarily. I think the bill we<br />\ndebated tonight could actually<br />\nbring us just that much closer<br />\nto direct U.S. military involvement in Central America.\"<br />\nCranston affirmed that he<br />\nand some of his senatorial colleagues proposed an alternative<br />\nbill which would have allowed<br />\nonly \"humanitarian\" aid consisting of medicine, food, and<br />\nclothing, to be given to the contras. He notes, however, that<br />\nthe bill which was actually pass-<br />\n<br />\ned<br />\ndid<br />\nnot<br />\nspecify<br />\n\"humanitarian\" aid did allow<br />\nfunding for weapons despite<br />\nthe Administration's claims to<br />\nthe contrary.<br />\nFollowing his opening<br />\nremarks on the next appropriations for Nicaraguan contras,<br />\nCranston took up the central<br />\ntopic of his lecture which concerned the consequences of the<br />\nU.S.-Soviet arms race and<br />\nseveral proposals for its<br />\ntermination.<br />\nCranston began by saying,<br />\n\"We are currently engaged in<br />\nthe most dangerous arms race<br />\never known, and the dangers<br />\nwill increase as more weapons<br />\nget built up on each side. I<br />\ndon't believe either the U.S. or<br />\nthe Soviet Union would ever<br />\ndeliberately launch a nuclear attack. I think the real danger is<br />\nan accident or a sudden escalation in tensions that could lead<br />\nto<br />\nmisperceptions<br />\nand<br />\ndestabilization, making a sudden resort to nuclear weapons<br />\nlikely.\"<br />\nHe added, \"Despite the<br />\ndanger, we and the Soviets continue to build up our stockpiles.<br />\nNations are now lining up as if<br />\nthey were lining up before the<br />\novens of Auschwitz while the<br />\novens were made more<br />\nefficient.\"<br />\nAs a first step towards<br />\navoiding the possibility of a<br />\n<br />\nnuclear<br />\nconfrontation,<br />\nCranston suggested that the<br />\nUnited States take the initiative<br />\nby declaring an immediate halt<br />\nto the testing and development<br />\nof nuclear weapons and request<br />\nthe Soviets do the same. He<br />\nsaid of such an initiative, \"It<br />\ndoesn't require negotiations,<br />\nit's easily verifiable through<br />\npresent technology; I don't<br />\nthink they'd violate that sort of<br />\nagreement, and I think such an<br />\ninitiative would create an environment much more conducive to real progress in arms<br />\nreduction negotiations.\"<br />\nDiscussing the feasibility of<br />\nsuch a policy, Cranston added,<br />\n\"Until we make an honest attempt, we'll never know if the<br />\nSoviets are serious about reducing the arms race. We can't<br />\nknow if they are since we've<br />\nnever really tried.\"<br />\nHe added, \"It's absolutely irresponsible for us to allow the<br />\nthreat of nuclear war to hang<br />\nover the heads of our children,<br />\nand presently, we're just not on<br />\nthe right course for doing<br />\nanything about it.\"<br />\nCranston conluded, \"We<br />\ndefinitely must take advantage<br />\nof the new Soviet leadership.<br />\nBut I fear it is not likely that we<br />\nwill break through till we have<br />\na new leader in the White<br />\nHouse.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nSC Announces Formation of Fall Break Panel<br />\n'Lana observed, \"I think \"That used to be a 'nothing'<br />\n\"The purpose of the quesclassroom<br />\ninstruction,<br />\nacademic advising, and tionnaire was to get an idea of this Council has done a good committee,\" Lana said, \"but<br />\nAn administrative committee undergraduate life at Hopkins. what students think about job...this group of people has this year it's been really impordesigned to consider proposals The 352 students responding Hopkins,\" said Richard Pan, been the most productive I've tant.\" He noted that \"The<br />\nincluding a fall break in the rated the quality of instruction who compiled data from the seen in four years on Council.\" Building and Grounds Comac- mittee really played a stabilizthe<br />\noutlined<br />\nuniversity calendar is in the pro- as the best aspect of Hopkins, replies. \"It's to help pinpoint He<br />\ning role in this whole security<br />\nCouncil<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nare<br />\nthink<br />\npeople<br />\ncomplishments<br />\nareas<br />\nwhat<br />\nStuwhile<br />\nand<br />\nsocial<br />\nestablished,<br />\nlife,<br />\nhousing,<br />\ncess of being<br />\ndent Council President Jon sense of student community problems, so we can work on Committees, including Career mess,\" and that \"the SAC<br />\ndidn't make any major<br />\nAdvising and Placement<br />\nimproving them \"<br />\nLana announced to the Coun- ranked lowest.<br />\nmistakes.<br />\ncil Wednesday.

How legitimate do you<br />\nthink those concerns are?<br />\nVogelbaum: The Fair has<br />\nmade great concessions to the<br />\nfaculty because of these concerns. In the past, there was<br />\ncontinuous music, there was<br />\nmusic on Fridays, there was<br />\nrock 9n roll music on Fridays.<br />\nThere is none of this now. I<br />\ndon't feel that the Fair interferes with studies at all now.<br />\nAside from the chairmen of the<br />\nFair. They did have problems.<br />\nQuayle: I think the biggest<br />\nthing is in the scheduling of the<br />\nweekend. It's best if it's the<br />\nweekend after all classes are<br />\nover, as it was last year. If it<br />\ncan't be worked out, there's<br />\nnothing we can do about it.<br />\nVogelbaum: Our schedule<br />\nhas to be set around things like<br />\nhome lacrosse games and<br />\nMCAT's. Unfortunately, we've<br />\nbeen on the same weekend as<br />\nthe Walk-a-thon for the last<br />\ntwo years. It causes trouble in<br />\ngetting things like snow fencing<br />\nand city booths.

In<br />\norder for the Fair to do activities for students, the Fair<br />\nhas to raise money. The only<br />\nway the Fair has to raise money<br />\nis through selling food spots,<br />\nfood spaces, and arts and crafts<br />\nspaces. In order to increase the<br />\namount of activities for<br />\nstudents during the day and at<br />\nnight, we have to raise more<br />\nmoney. The costs of a lot of the<br />\nactivities that we do have have<br />\nincreased, whereas the rents<br />\nthat we charge cannot increase<br />\nvery much because we are in<br />\ncompetition with other<br />\nfestivals. This year we increased the size of our booths for<br />\narts and crafts spaces from<br />\n10x6 to 10x10. But we didn't increase the booth fee. And if we<br />\nhad, we probably would have<br />\nlost a lot of vendors becasue<br />\nthere were a lot of other<br />\nfestivals going on this weekend<br />\nthat charged about that much.<br />\nI think that by getting student<br />\ngroups to work with the vendors and by initiating activities<br />\n<br />\nthrough the day one of the people delivering the booths told us<br />\nthat there was a fire at the<br />\nwarehouse where they keep the<br />\nbooths. We didn't think too<br />\nmuch of it because he didn't<br />\nseem so concerned. Later on in<br />\nthe day, we found out that it<br />\nwas a pretty big fire. We tried<br />\ncalling the warehouse. All we<br />\ngot was a busy signal. We<br />\nthought they had taken the<br />\nphone off the hook. Well,<br />\nLaura Kaufman, one of our<br />\nfood co-chairmen, works down<br />\nin the mayor's office, so she<br />\nhad several connections whom<br />\nshe called. She finally found<br />\nout that it was a pretty serious<br />\nfire and that just about<br />\neverything was in the process of<br />\nbeing destroyed. At that point<br />\nwe really couldn't be sure how<br />\nmany booths would be left for<br />\nus because all that we knew was<br />\nthat everything was burning. So<br />\nwe started calling around trying<br />\nto rent booths. Eventually,<br />\nthough, we found out that there<br />\nwere some booths saved. The<br />\nnext morning, Laura and I<br />\ndrove out to the warehouse.

We found that a lot<br />\nof the booths we were to get<br />\nwere not even in the warehouse,<br />\nbut were in a seperate lot. We<br />\ntalked to several of the people<br />\ndown there and they said that<br />\nthey would be getting them to<br />\nus, So it turned out that we<br />\nunderestimated the number of<br />\nbooths that we would need. We<br />\nhave to order these booths in<br />\nFebruary, but we don't know<br />\nhow many we need until April,<br />\nso we ended up needing more<br />\nthan we orginally thought that<br />\nwe needed. All the stages in the<br />\nwarehouse were burned, but we<br />\ndid manage to get four of the<br />\nfive that we had requested. To<br />\ntell you the truth, I think<br />\nMayor Schaefer is really<br />\nresponsible for saving us and<br />\ngetting the booths that we needed. The first thing that we were<br />\ntold was that Mayor Schaefer<br />\nhad visited the warehouse and<br />\nsaid that all requests would be<br />\nhonored, and that City workers<br />\nwould be on overtime until all<br />\nrequests were honored. So it<br />\nwas really the fact that the City and Mayor Schaefer decided<br />\nto honor the requests for the<br />\nbooths that we were able to get<br />\nthem at all.<br />\nN-L: How well do you think<br />\nsecurity went this year?<br />\nQuayle: Security went very<br />\nwell this year. Both our student<br />\ngroups (whom we hire for<br />\nsecurity in parking, on the<br />\nquads, and in the beer garden)<br />\nas well as Hopkins Security did<br />\na good job. Specfically, Major<br />\nLarkin said that as far as security was concerned, it was the<br />\nbest Fair that he's seen since<br />\nhe's been here.<br />\nVogelbaum: He started telling us that on Saturday and<br />\ncontinued through Sunday.<br />\nQuayle: It's almost surprising that there were no major incidents whatsoever. There were<br />\nno big fights, there were no<br />\nproblems with large amounts of<br />\ntheft, etc....<br />\n<br />\nQuayle: It was disappointing<br />\nin that we worked on it a lot to<br />\nbegin with. In the beginning of<br />\nthe semester, we put a lot of<br />\ntime and effort in trying to<br />\nsecure bands for a concert,<br />\nalthough, I think as far as I'm<br />\nconcerned, and for just about<br />\neveryone who worked on the<br />\nFair, I don't think there was<br />\nanything lacking this weekend<br />\nbecause there was no concert.<br />\nVogelbaum: I started on the<br />\nphone on January 2nd, the day<br />\nI got back, trying to find out<br />\nwhat bands were available. It<br />\nwas really the only thing that<br />\nwe could do at that point. Mary<br />\n<br />\nEverything ran rather smoothly<br />\nbecause we were able to keep in contact with each other and everyone<br />\nknew pretty much what had to be<br />\ndone.<br />\n\u2014Mike Vogelbaum<br />\nEllen Porter warned us from<br />\nthe very beginning that we probably wouldn't be able to do a<br />\nconcert, as did last year's Fair<br />\nchairmen. In fact, I went down<br />\nto the University of Virginia<br />\nand saw Sharon Crane, one of<br />\nlast year's Fair chairmen. When<br />\nI told her that we were working<br />\non getting a concert, she said,<br />\n\"I warned you not to do that.\"<br />\nI disagree. I'm glad that we<br />\ntried because we did learn a lot<br />\nof lessons, lessons that I think<br />\nwill really help the Spring Fair<br />\nchairmen next year.<br />\nN-L: That leads into the next<br />\nquestion I was going to ask.<br />\nHow feasible do you think a<br />\nconcert at Spring Fair will be<br />\nnext year?<br />\nVogelbaum: The biggest problem with the concert is the size<br />\nof Shriver. It only hold a thousand people. And Hopkins<br />\nstudents, I don't blame them,<br />\n<br />\nWhat I'm thinking of is something<br />\nalong the lines of having different<br />\npeople, maybe different chairmen,<br />\ndealing with different aspects of the<br />\nFair rather than both dealing with all<br />\nthe aspects of the Fair.<br />\nBryce Quayle<br />\nVogelbaum: We were quite<br />\nsurprised because when we<br />\nheard the weather reports and<br />\nheard that it was going to be a<br />\nvery hot weekend, we were of<br />\ncourse happy that we were going to have the good weather,<br />\nbut we were afraid that that the<br />\nheat would really cause some<br />\nproblems, but it didn't. It really didn't. It was a very mellow<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nN-L: Was the lack of a concert this year a disappointment<br />\nto you?<br />\n<br />\nvarious different companies to<br />\nsponsor such an event after we<br />\nhad our theme decided and<br />\nafter we got things rolling. But<br />\nit was really too late to get<br />\nthrough the paperwork and the<br />\nred tape of approaching a large<br />\ncorporation to try to sponsor<br />\nsomething like that.<br />\nVogelbaum: Let me add to<br />\nthat. It wasn't until later that<br />\nwe realized that we would have<br />\nto approach a large company to<br />\nget a large sponsorship. We<br />\nwent through the proposed<br />\nbudget for the Cyndi Lauper<br />\nconcert last year, and that had<br />\nsome small sponsorhips and it<br />\n<br />\ndon't want to pay a lot for a<br />\nconcert at Hopkins. People will<br />\npay ten or fifteen dollars to see<br />\nsomeone play down at the Civic<br />\nCenter, but they won't pay<br />\nseven or eight dollars to see<br />\nanyone play here.<br />\nQuayle: The biggest thing<br />\nthat needs to be done for a concert to be pulled off is that funding needs to be found. We<br />\ndidn't have time this year. We<br />\nweren't selected early enough to<br />\nseek that funding from the very<br />\nbeginning. We approached<br />\n<br />\nhad a few other numbers for<br />\npublicity.We then realized that<br />\nthat concert probably would<br />\nhave lost a lot of money. It just<br />\ndidn't budget for everything,<br />\nand some of the sponsorships<br />\nweren't actually secure.<br />\nN-L: What reccomendations<br />\nwould you make or will you<br />\nmake to the Spring Fair<br />\nchairmen next year given the<br />\nopportunity?<br />\nVogelbaum: Well, we will<br />\nhave that opprtunity since we<br />\ndo write up a final report. And<br />\nwe have every committee chairman contribute to that report.<br />\nQuayle: I think the main reccomendation that I'll make has<br />\nto do with the structure of the<br />\nFair, executive people, and just<br />\nMike and I and our treasurer<br />\nand the committee chairmen. I<br />\nthink that as the Fair is continuing to grow, more and more<br />\nbureauocracy tends to come<br />\nabout. We have more and more<br />\ncommittees and more people<br />\nworking on them, and we have<br />\nto set up more of a definite<br />\nsystem for communication to<br />\nbe most efficient and for people to be kept in contact with<br />\neveryone else. What I'm thinking of is something along the lines<br />\nof having different people,<br />\nmaybe different chairmen,<br />\ndealing with different aspects of<br />\nthe Fair rather than both dealing with all the aspects of the<br />\nFair.<br />\nVogelbaum: I think one reccomendation that I will make is<br />\nthat when the chairmen select<br />\ntheir committee chairmen, they<br />\nshould definitely take into account other activities that these<br />\napplicants are invloved with.<br />\nOne problem that we had this<br />\nyear was that a lot of our<br />\nchairmen were over extended.<br />\nThey had too many other activities, and when it came<br />\naround to two or three weeks<br />\nbefore the Fair, they didn't put<br />\nin as much time as was needed<br />\nto get everything done.<br />\n<br />\n-mak_<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/9<br />\n<br />\nFair Fun<br />\nContinues<br />\nInto Night<br />\n<br />\nBo-Peep, Panther<br />\nVisit Kids At Fair<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br />\n<br />\nby L.M. Asta<br />\nThis year's Spring Fair night<br />\nentertainment was supposedly<br />\nupgraded to compensate for the<br />\nabsent concert.

ARA<br />\nmunchies were provided along<br />\nwith table set ups off the Great<br />\nHall. In the Little Theatre,<br />\nChains of Seduction opened for<br />\nthe Tau Babies. The Little<br />\nTheatre handled neither the<br />\nnumber of people who came<br />\nfor the show nor the heat. In<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion, there was<br />\ndancing to the rock band Jelly<br />\nRoll.<br />\nThree major events were<br />\nscheduled for Saturday night: a<br />\nvideo dance, the Crusty Nostrils<br />\ngoing Hawaiian, and a comedy<br />\nperformance.<br />\n\"The Hawaiian PunchLine\" comedy of the Budweiser<br />\nComedy Tour featured Jeff<br />\nAltman, a Johns Hopkins<br />\nalumnus. Tickets for the show,<br />\nwhich was held in the L/V<br />\nRoom, were sold on a first<br />\ncome, first served basis at the<br />\ndoor. Lines started forming at<br />\nnine o'clock and the show was<br />\nsold out before ten. Standing<br />\nroom was added, but the<br />\nstudents who wanted to get in<br />\nfor the entertainment outnumbered the available spaces.<br />\nAlternatives to the comedy<br />\nincluded the Tropical (formerly Crusty) Nostrils in the Great<br />\nHall. General Hopkins regulars<br />\nsuch as Director of Student Activities Mary Ellen Porter,<br />\nAssociate Dean of the G.W.C.<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering<br />\nJared Cohon, and Daniel<br />\nNaiman, assistant professor of<br />\nMathematical Sciences, performed for a crowd very much<br />\ninto dancing. They played such<br />\nCrusty classics as \"Pink<br />\nCadillac,\" \"Fluffy,\" \"I Like<br />\nThem Big and Stupid,\" and a<br />\nrousing \"Time Warp.\" The<br />\nNasalles opened with unusually tame costumes, but went to<br />\ntheir usual style after a break<br />\n(e.g., a plastic fruit bikini top).<br />\nThe Glass Pavilion hosted<br />\nthe \"Wild Video Dance Party.\" The video set-up included<br />\ntwo projection cameras.

I feel this way I'll be able to speak<br />\na little more candidly about Hopkins and<br />\nexpress my opinions as my own.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University is an<br />\nincredibly strange place which seems to<br />\napproach undergraduate education in a<br />\nunique manner. That is, there is a<br />\ndefinite concentration upon research<br />\nabove all else. This seems to result in little or no attention to teaching for its own<br />\nsake and in an academic intensity which<br />\nseems to pervade all aspects of<br />\nHomewood life. In addition, there is an<br />\nadmittedly limited social life here. The<br />\ncharacter of the school has changed little during its existence and probably will<br />\nnot change substantially in the future.<br />\nThere are advantages and disadvantages in all of this. The advantages are<br />\nsometimes difficult to see through all the<br />\ngarbage, but they do exist. Many<br />\nstudents come here primarily to prepare<br />\nfor and get into professional schools.<br />\nHopkins is highly successful in this<br />\nrespect; students can and do get into<br />\ngraduate schools without a great deal of<br />\ndifficulty. The lack of a structured social<br />\nenvironment, while annoying to some,<br />\nremoves the pressure of social activity<br />\nfound at many colleges and allows<br />\nundergraduates to build a social life<br />\nwhich suits them, even if they have to<br />\nwork at it. As far as the non-existent<br />\nteaching standards go, students here are<br />\nnot taught anything\u2014they have to learn<br />\nit. Perhaps that isn't such an awful<br />\nsituation.<br />\nAlong with other quirks at Hopkins is<br />\na peculiar approach to student activities<br />\nby the students, of all people. An opportunity exists here to become involved in<br />\npractically any area which strikes your<br />\nfancy. There are very few schools in the<br />\ncountry academically comparable to<br />\nHopkins in which an individual can step<br />\nonto a varsity team, write for the school<br />\npaper or magazine, chair a Student<br />\nCouncil committee, or create an entirely new organization merely by expressing an interest in doing so. However, only a painfully small number of people<br />\nhere look beyond their studies and<br />\ndevote themselves to something extracurricular. This is unfortunate.<br />\nNow that I've shared my philosophy<br />\nof Hopkins, I'd like to speak a little more<br />\nspecifically about the News-Letter itself.<br />\nMost people on this campus see only a<br />\n<br />\nPractical Implication<br />\n<br />\nIndifferent benevolence goes to the<br />\nHomewood administration and to the<br />\nStudent Council, led by the debonair Jon<br />\nLana.

All that one has to do<br />\nto see that this accusation<br />\nsometimes applies is to read the<br />\ntabloids of the loony tunes left,<br />\nwhich heap praise upon such<br />\nworkers' paradises as Vietnam,<br />\nCuba, and the Soviet Union.<br />\nOne good way to see that the<br />\nstereotype is unfair is to read<br />\nCarlos Franqui's Family Portrait with Fidel, a book written<br />\nby a revolutionary socialist that<br />\nis a blistering condemnation of<br />\nthe present Soviet and Cuban<br />\nsystems.<br />\nCertainly no one can argue<br />\n<br />\nthat Mr. Franqui is unqualified<br />\nto critique the Cuban revolution. Franqui was an integral<br />\npart of the revolution, both as<br />\na fighter and as editor of<br />\nRevolucion, the newspaper that<br />\nFranqui describes as the<br />\n\"mouthpiece of the revolution.\" The author is the man<br />\nwhose image has been removed from the middle photograph<br />\non the cover of the book; years<br />\nafter therevolution,Castro considered Franqui important and<br />\ndangerous enough to declare<br />\nhim a \"nonperson,\" in the<br />\ntradition of Castro's Soviet<br />\nsponsors. The highly-acclaimed<br />\nPBS show Frontline recently interviewed Franqui as part of its<br />\nspecial segment concerning<br />\nCastro's revolution. William F.<br />\nBuckley, Mr. Capitalism<br />\nhimself, recently told the Sun<br />\nthat he used Franqui as a major source for his latest novel,<br />\nSee You Later, Alligator, which<br />\nconcerns the Cuban revolutionary government.<br />\nThe book gets off to a bad<br />\n<br />\nExcerpt<br />\n\"The nationalization of<br />\nthe sugar industry was a<br />\ndeath blow for private property.

This guy is<br />\nobviously very impressed with<br />\nhimself, but his never-ending<br />\nstring of flowery metaphors<br />\nand idiotic puns nauseated me.<br />\nFortunately, Franqui's matterof-fact style, while not particularly aesthetic, is much<br />\nmore palatable.<br />\nFor the most part, Mr. Franqui tells his story in<br />\nchronological order, starting<br />\nwith the overthrow of the dictator Batista. He tells the<br />\nfascinating story of how three<br />\nfactions, one pro-Soviet, one<br />\npro-American, and one (Franqui's) pro-independence, arose,<br />\nand how the hard-line proSoviet group won out in the<br />\nend. Franqui gives an insider's<br />\nversion of Castro's rise to dictator and details Castro's<br />\nskillful manipulations. He<br />\ndiscusses the Bay of Pigs incident and the Cuban missile<br />\ncrisis from a Cuban point of<br />\nview. Most importantly, Franqui gives his own version of<br />\nhow individual rights withered<br />\nunder Castro and how, in his<br />\nopinion, the Cuban people<br />\ntraded one elite ruling class for<br />\na new one with new rhetoric.<br />\nhis<br />\nto<br />\naddition<br />\nIn<br />\nchronological account, Franqui<br />\nincludes a section dealing with<br />\nCastro's life and ideology, and<br />\nan appendix containing some<br />\nimportant letters, speeches, and<br />\ninterviews. The appendix provides useful documentation to<br />\naccompany the story.<br />\nThis book has several problems.

Still, this<br />\nbook has two redeeming<br />\nqualities which make it worth<br />\nrecommending. The first is that<br />\nFranqui tells the truth (his story<br />\nagrees right down the line with<br />\nthe Frontline segment, which<br />\n<br />\nincluded several interviews<br />\nfrom those on all sides of the<br />\nconflict). The second is that<br />\nFranqui's perspective, that<br />\nof a disillusioned participant in<br />\nthe revolution, is an invaluable<br />\none that is rarely heard from.<br />\nRegardless of your political<br />\norientation, this book will give<br />\nyou a valuable insight into<br />\nrevolutionary politics and the<br />\nviews of democratic socialists.<br />\n<br />\nWhat You've Been Waiting All Semester ForThe Official N-L Review of<br />\nThe Cyndi Lauper Scrapbook<br />\nby Miriam Tucker<br />\n<br />\nI hate to admit it, but I really enjoyed this book.

His<br />\ncharacters live with the system<br />\nbecause they don't know<br />\nanything else. Bantu Sergeant<br />\nZondi thanks his blessings for<br />\nthe house he has, which has<br />\nno electricity, bathroom, or<br />\nkitchen. It is, James McClure<br />\ntells us, the way of life for a<br />\nBlack or Indian to be insulted<br />\n<br />\narke<br />\n<br />\nhid<br />\ntv.vt<br />\n<br />\n- 04'<br />\nc1<br />\n<br />\n100 E. i 3rd St. 1 BLOCK FROM CAMPUS<br />\nFor Appointment Tiles- Sat Call<br />\n2 35-708 3<br />\n100.<br />\n<br />\nSpc, al St-11(1(.11i Raw \\vith II)<br />\n<br />\nJoin the<br />\nChessie<br />\nDEgeneration<br />\n<br />\nook riefs<br />\nand presumed dumb.

Mr.<br />\nMcClure writes in such a way<br />\nas to keep the reader on the<br />\nedge of his seat.<br />\nThere is little more I can say<br />\nto recommend The Artful<br />\nEgg. It is the very best mystery<br />\nI have ever read. So go out<br />\nand buy this book. Enjoy it.<br />\n<br />\nBird Tales<br />\nby D.J. Colby<br />\nCrows, by Charles Dickinson;<br />\nAlfred A. Knopf; 335 pp;<br />\n$15.95.<br />\nCharles Dickinson has a<br />\ntalent for bringing complex<br />\nhuman relations to the printed<br />\npage in a way that makes his<br />\nnovels wonderful to read. It is<br />\nthis talent which makes Crows<br />\nan interesting and enjoyable<br />\nwork of fiction.<br />\nThe protagonist of Crows is<br />\nRobert Cigar, a young college<br />\ngraduate who has had a taste<br />\nof adult life; and decided that<br />\nhe did not like it. He is invited<br />\nto stay at the home of one of<br />\n<br />\nhis professors, and readily accepts. When the professor is<br />\nkilled in a boating accident,<br />\nRobert feels he has an obligation to remain in the house<br />\nand comfort the family, even<br />\nthough they do not agree with<br />\nhim. He prolongs his stay for<br />\nseveral years, long after his<br />\nwelcome has elapsed. In his<br />\ndealings with the family,<br />\nwhich consists of the widow,<br />\nher two sons, and her only<br />\ndaughter (who Robert sleeps<br />\nwith), Robert grows and<br />\nlearns many things about<br />\nhimself and the world.<br />\nThe name of the novel<br />\nderives from the stories that<br />\nBen, the professor, told to<br />\nRobert. Ben instilled in crows<br />\nall the characteristics that he<br />\nsaw in people or wished people had. In his stories, the<br />\ncrows often symbolize him<br />\nand those around him.<br />\nThrough the stories of crows<br />\nwe learn much about the man<br />\nwho tells them and about life<br />\nin general. When Ben disappears in a lake and is not<br />\nfound, Robert continues the<br />\nsearch for his body long after<br />\nthe authorities give up. In his<br />\nnever-ending search, Robert<br />\nlives in the past, not wanting<br />\nto face his life ahead of him.<br />\nIt is not until he can let go of<br />\nthe past that he gains the confidence in himself necessary to<br />\ncontinue his life on his own.<br />\nAll of the relationships in<br />\nCrows are well written and<br />\nhighly emotional. Anyone<br />\nwho likes reading about people and their interactions will<br />\nalmost surely enjoy this book.<br />\n<br />\nThe Girl Just Wants to Have Fun<br />\n<br />\nSpring into Fitness<br />\n<br />\nContinued from Page 13<br />\nvintage clothing store in New<br />\nYork, which explains, at least<br />\nin part, the wacky wardrobe.<br />\nThe book continues with a<br />\ndetailed chronicle of her involvement with the short-lived<br />\nband Blue Angel, her love/hate<br />\nrelationship with her \"personal<br />\nadvisor\" Captain Lou Albano,<br />\nand finally, her quick rise to<br />\nstardom following the release<br />\nof the \"Girls\" video.<br />\nThe feminist message of<br />\n\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\"<br />\nis explained by, \"Her idea of<br />\nfun in the video was showing<br />\nwomen they could be free, be<br />\nthemselves, and have a good<br />\ntime.\" I'll buy that.<br />\nThis book really gave me a<br />\nsense of what Cyndi Lauper is<br />\nall about, and why she is the<br />\nway she is.

Proteins are composed primarily of<br />\nlow atomic mass atoms such as<br />\ncarbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and<br />\nnitrogen. These atoms do not<br />\nreflect the electron beam well,<br />\nthus very high electron energies<br />\nare required to study the protein in detail. However, at high<br />\nenergies, the electron beam<br />\nbegins to destroy the protein<br />\nstudied. This destruction<br />\ncreates broken pieces of the<br />\nmolecule of artifacts and makes<br />\nit difficult to determine whether<br />\nyou are looking at an artifact or<br />\n<br />\nthe protein. By using an<br />\nelectron-dense label, a lower<br />\nenergy beam can be used since<br />\nthe label easily reflects the electrons and can indicate the position of a particular part of the<br />\nprotein.<br />\nThe electron-dense label<br />\nmust have three primary<br />\ncharacteristics. First, the label<br />\nmust have some chemical structure or functional group that<br />\nallows it to be attached at the<br />\ndesired position of the protein.<br />\nSecond, it must be sufficiently<br />\nelectron-dense so that individual molecules can be seen<br />\neasily in the TEM. Finally, it<br />\nshould be small enough to provide sufficient detail or<br />\nresolution.<br />\nAs an example, one com-<br />\n<br />\nDave Tardio<br />\n<br />\nDr. Beer of the Biophysics Department.<br />\n<br />\nmonly used label is the protein<br />\nferratin. It contains a core of<br />\nover 2000 iron atoms, making<br />\nit easily seen in the TEM. Its<br />\nsize, however, permits a resolution of 200-300 angstroms.<br />\nIn 1978, Bartlett, Bauer, and<br />\nSinger at the University of<br />\nCalifornia developed an<br />\nelectron-dense molecule which<br />\ncould be used for labeling. This<br />\nmolecule contains a core of<br />\neleven gold atoms with the<br />\ndiameter of the core being only 8.2 angstroms. Thus, a label<br />\nbased on this undecagold<br />\ncluster would have a resolution<br />\nin the tens of angstroms (ten<br />\nmillionths of a centimeter).<br />\nThe undecagold cluster<br />\nmolecule used by Dr. Beer at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Department<br />\nof Biophysics is composed of<br />\nthe eleven gold atoms surrounded by an organic shell<br />\ncontaining free amines (-NH).<br />\nThe free amines can be attached to different bifunctional<br />\nmolecules, molecules which can<br />\nbe attached to the amine at one<br />\nend and another structure at the<br />\nother end, or arms which would<br />\nallow it to be labeled to a variety of different functional<br />\ngroups or proteins.<br />\nBefore the undecagold<br />\nmolecule can be used as a label,<br />\ntwo modifications must be<br />\nmade. First, all of the amines<br />\nbut one are blocked by acetylation, which covers the amine,<br />\n<br />\nperimented with to find the optimum length.<br />\nOne planned use of gold<br />\nlabeling is to investigate protein<br />\nstructure in the electron<br />\nmicroscope. The gold cluster<br />\nwill indicate the position of part<br />\nof the protein. Then several pictures of the protein will be<br />\ntaken using low energy electrons. These pictures will have<br />\na very high background. A<br />\ncomputer can process the pictures, however and eliminate<br />\nthe background. The position<br />\nof the image created by the gold<br />\ncluster would be used to align<br />\nthe pictures of the protein.<br />\nThus, a high resolution picture<br />\nof the protein could be obtained without destroying the<br />\nprotein.<br />\n<br />\nso only one arm would be attached to the cluster. This<br />\nprevents labeling two proteins<br />\nwith the same molecule. Second, an arm is selected and attached to the gold cluster. This<br />\narm has one end which reacts<br />\nwith the unacetylated amine<br />\nand another end which reacts<br />\nwith the functional group to the<br />\ndesired position on the protein.<br />\nOne important factor in the<br />\nselection of the arm is its<br />\nlength. The shorter the arm, the<br />\nmore accurately the position of<br />\nthe label can be determined.<br />\nHowever, a short arm may be<br />\nphysically blocked by the protein or sterically hindered from<br />\nreacting with the desired functional group. Thus, arms of difmust be ex,ferent lengths<br />\n<br />\nCommunicating\u2014Just Plain<br />\nEnglish; 1:00p.m.: New Tech<br />\nTimes; 2:00p.m.: The Nature<br />\nPublic TV\u2014Science and<br />\nof Things III; 3:00p.m.: Nova<br />\nNature Programs<br />\n(R)\u2014Whale Watch; 8:00p.m.:<br />\nThe Undersea World of JacChannels 67, 22 Baltimore<br />\nques Cousteau\u2014The Legend<br />\nof Lake Titicaca; 9:00p.m.:<br />\nFri., April 26, 7:30p.m.: Nature (R)\u2014Flight of the<br />\nWild, Wild World of Condor, Part III.<br />\nAnimals\u2014New Americans.<br />\nSun., April 28, 10:00a.m.:<br />\nSat., April 27, 8:30a.m.: The New Literacy: An InOceanus\u2014The Tropic Seas, troduction to Computers\u2014<br />\nMineral Resources; 10:30 Computer Security, Issues<br />\na.m.: Understanding Human and Trends in Computing;<br />\nBehavior\u2014Psychotherapy; 7:00p.m.: The Living Planet:<br />\n1 2:0 Op.m.:Exploring<br />\nContinued on Page 16<br />\nLanguage: Thinking, Writing,<br />\n<br />\nHighlights<br />\n<br />\nGRADUATE STUDENTS CAN PICK UP<br />\nSOME EXTRA CREDIT IN NEW YORK.<br />\nIt can be difficult to establish credit while you're still in school.

Niven labeled the<br />\nprogram \"unique\" in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nAlcoholism is the primary<br />\ncause of 30 to 55 percent of all<br />\nadmissions to inner city<br />\nteaching hospitals, according<br />\nto approximately 50 major<br />\nstudies. But physicians at<br />\nrarely<br />\nhospitals<br />\nthese<br />\nrecognize alcoholism as the<br />\ncause of their patients' problems. At Hopkins, for instance, alcoholism is recorded<br />\nas the primary diagnosis in<br />\nfewer than five percent of<br />\n<br />\nadmissions.<br />\nis<br />\nWhen alcoholism<br />\ndiagnosed, the disease often<br />\nhas progressed to the point<br />\nwhere treatment is difficult, if<br />\nnot impossible. But in the early stages of the disease, longterm success rates as high as<br />\n75 percent are not uncommon, says Emma Stokes,<br />\nPh.D., coordinator of the new<br />\nprogram.<br />\nPast programs throughout<br />\nthe nation have had limitec<br />\nimpact because they general<br />\nly involved alcholism specia,<br />\nists who taught medical<br />\nstudents about the subject.

Some look<br />\ngood, some look bad: Caveat<br />\nemptor!<br />\nMany stars of the upcoming<br />\nfeatures will be trying to atone<br />\nfor the poor quality of their<br />\nmost recent films; in other<br />\nwords, they are coming off of<br />\ncritical and/or box office<br />\nfailures.

White,<br />\nJr. Athletic Center, federal<br />\nagents moved in Monday and<br />\narrested Hopkins head basketball coach Ed \"Nappy\" Doherty and assistant coach Lee<br />\n\"Happy\" Horowitz. Tuesday,<br />\nthe two were arraigned in<br />\nfederal court on multiple<br />\ncharges including point shaving, illegal recruiting, and<br />\ncorruption.<br />\n\"I was shocked,\" said<br />\ndepartment secretary Jane<br />\nSmoot, who witnessed the arrest by \"three men in dark blue<br />\nsuits.\" Horowitz, who was<br />\nbusy adjusting the large<br />\nschedule board in his office at<br />\nthe time, reportedly resisted arrest and had to be subdued by<br />\nforce. Both he and Doherty<br />\nwere handcuffed, as they were<br />\ndescribed in a federal APB as<br />\nbeing \"armed and dangerous.\"<br />\nDoherty especially is known for<br />\nsudden and extreme outbursts<br />\nof excitement.<br />\nAccording to Justice Department official Nick Nikic, the<br />\narrests were the culmination of<br />\na long investigation involving<br />\ncorruption in Hopkins basketball. \"We have documented<br />\nevidence of point shaving of<br />\nunprecedented magnitude,\" he<br />\nsaid in a prepared statement.<br />\n\"We have also uncovered over<br />\ntwenty instances of gross<br />\nrecruiting violations.\"<br />\nWhen asked to elaborate,<br />\nNikic unloaded a suitcase of<br />\ndocuments and photos. \"We<br />\nestimate that Doherty and<br />\nHorowitz have earned over $2<br />\n<br />\nmillion in illicit funds from this<br />\noperation. Point shaving alone<br />\naccounted for approximately<br />\n$1.7 million.\"<br />\nSpecifically, Nikic cited the<br />\nBlue Jays' 82-44 loss to<br />\nWidener on February 2 this<br />\nyear. The betting line favored<br />\nHopkins by 6 points. Doherty,<br />\nas alleged by the Justice<br />\npurposely<br />\nDepartment,<br />\ndisrupted the Blue Jay offense<br />\nand refused to replace players<br />\nin foul trouble, reducing an early Hopkins lead and easily falling below the point spread.<br />\nThe coaches' take from that<br />\ngame alone, according to Nikic,<br />\nwas over $300,000. Half of this<br />\nwas split by the two, and half<br />\nwas channeled into a bogus<br />\nsummer camp which Horowitz<br />\nsupposedly operates in New<br />\nEngland.<br />\n\"I can't believe it,\" said<br />\nsophomore power forward<br />\nSteve Mitchell. \"I thought that<br />\nwe just got blown away night<br />\nafter night. I never thought that<br />\nshaving was involved.\"<br />\nDespite the Jays' 8-13 record<br />\nthis season, informed sources<br />\nclaim that Doherty and<br />\nHorowitz were successful by<br />\ndisplaying the Blue Jays' obvious individual talent, thus<br />\nswinging the betting line in their<br />\nfavor. On game nights,<br />\nhowever, the two made sure<br />\nthat the contest would not<br />\nresult in a Blue Jay win.<br />\nAs for the counts of<br />\nrecruiting, Nikic presented the<br />\ntestimony of several high school<br />\nseniors who claimed that<br />\nDoherty offered them bonuses<br />\nof \"cars and luscious Hopkins<br />\nwomen\" in exchange for a<br />\n<br />\nsignature on a letter of intent.<br />\n\"Oh, he said I could have<br />\nanything,\" said Joe Piazza<br />\nfrom the Bronx, New York. \"I<br />\nwas promised booze, cars, and<br />\nloose women. When it cane to<br />\nHopkins, however, I found<br />\nnone of these. The locker room<br />\nwasn't even carpeted, and we<br />\nwere promised a full stereo<br />\nsystem.\"<br />\nEvidently, such illegal<br />\nrecruiting schemes backfired<br />\nwhen recruits actually came to<br />\nHomewood. Though five<br />\nfreshmen \"were almost think-<br />\n<br />\ning about coming,\" said junior<br />\ncaptain Ralph Horne, the Jays<br />\nplayed the 1984-85 season<br />\nwithout freshmen.<br />\nAt a press conference<br />\nWednesday<br />\nafternoon,<br />\nHopkins Athletic Director Bob<br />\nScott expressed his support for<br />\nthe two coaches. \"I am fully<br />\nassured of the innocence of<br />\nNappy and Happy,\" he said.<br />\n\"I want to assure you that there<br />\nis no doubt in my mind. I have<br />\ntotal confidence that we will<br />\nsoon see their names<br />\nexonerated.\"<br />\n<br />\nSorority Bites the Big One<br />\n\"Maybe selling buttered<br />\ntoast at Spring Fair wasn't such<br />\na good idea after all,\" said a<br />\ndowncast Queen Momo<br />\nPatricia Vale Merrick at the<br />\nfinal Alpha Momo Squid<br />\nmeeting last week. The disappointing truth for the Momos<br />\nis that finally, despite all fundraising efforts, they will have to<br />\ngive up their dreams of flying<br />\nto Seattle, Washington, to visit<br />\ntheir founder, Joanne Wittau,<br />\nwho deserted Baltimore and the<br />\n'mos back in the spring of 1982.<br />\nIn spite of this gloomy<br />\nforecast, the AMS Sorority,<br />\nInc., was able to come to some<br />\ncheery conclusions at their<br />\nmeeting. The proposal to adopt<br />\nfuchsia as the official sorority<br />\ncolor, raised by Minister of<br />\nPropaganda Eileen Fitzgerald,<br />\npassed unanimously among<br />\nthose present. The only two absent ministers were Claire E.<br />\nO'Connor, Minister of Torture<br />\n<br />\nand Persuasion, who was last<br />\nseen sleeping in the Hut, and<br />\nMinister of Locks and Bolts<br />\nKathrin Engisch, who was locked out of the meeting.<br />\nBut why fuchsia? \"Look at<br />\nwhat comes after it in the dictionary,\" answered the<br />\nenigmatic Fitzgerald.<br />\nDebate raged over who<br />\nshould go to get ice for the<br />\ndrinks from a gross neighbor.<br />\nSome claimed Susan Fetterman, Minister of Alcohol,<br />\nshould perform the dreaded<br />\ntask, while others postulated it<br />\nwas, and always would be, a<br />\nduty reserved for the Eternal<br />\nPledges. Sargeant-at-Arms<br />\nEllen \"Lenny\" Chuang<br />\nbrought everything back to<br />\norder after spilling several beers<br />\non the carpet and volunteering<br />\nto get both ice and paper towels<br />\nherself.<br />\nPrime Minister Theresa<br />\n<br />\nZemanavich moved to open<br />\ndiscussion on building a shrine<br />\nto the AMS mascot but no one<br />\nseconded because they were all<br />\ndiscussing going to the movies<br />\nat the Charles. Vice Premier<br />\nKatherine Katsidhe had a ticket<br />\nbook, but there were only four<br />\nleft. That was cool by Minister<br />\nof Entertainment Sybil Anderson, because she wanted to go<br />\naround to all the dorms and introduce herself to all the guys<br />\nanyway.

In addition to those<br />\nepistles of bemusement or<br />\nhatred, the occasional plea for<br />\nadvicefalls across my desk. For<br />\nsome mysterious reason, a<br />\ndeceptively perky blonde named Deirdre X. was compelled to<br />\nshare a few traumas with me.<br />\nHer letter arrived in Box 33<br />\nstained with formaldehyde and<br />\ntears. Ifeel her words speak to<br />\ncountless others on this campus, and her dilemma could be<br />\nuniversal.<br />\nDear Sujata,<br />\nYou don't know me, or<br />\nmaybe you do but you just ignore me by staring into your<br />\ncoffee all the time. But you just<br />\nhave to listen, because I'm on<br />\nthe edge. My problem is<br />\nsomething I can't admit to easily, in the face of massive peer<br />\ncontempt. But at a Pre-Meds<br />\nAnonymous meeting last night,<br />\nI realized the first step toward<br />\nrecovery is the recognition of<br />\nthe problem. I don't want to<br />\nrecover, exactly, but I need<br />\nhelp. Or rather he does. You<br />\nsee, lam guilty ofloving a premed.<br />\nOh, I never meant to in the<br />\nfirst place. My mother warned<br />\nme about the kind of boys who<br />\nwould try to get under your<br />\nsweater with a stethoscope. But<br />\nwhen I met Ezekiel all caution<br />\nblew to the wind.<br />\nIt all started one long-ago<br />\nafternoon. As a Writing<br />\nSeminars major, I was scouting<br />\nD-Level for a Jack Kerouac<br />\nnovel and someone cute to<br />\nwrite in my poetry journal<br />\nabout. It was a freak accident<br />\nmeeting Zeke, as he likes to be<br />\ncalledfor short; tall, dark, and<br />\nsquint-eyed and stoopshouldered already. He had the<br />\nmost adorable stutter I ever<br />\nheard. Zeke was in the process<br />\nof hiding the reserve room's<br />\nbiology exams beside some<br />\nSylvia Plath poetry. Hefigured<br />\nno pre-med knew the library<br />\nwent down past C-Level, so he<br />\nwould be able to kick ass on the<br />\nmid-term.<br />\nRight then Ifellfor him, that<br />\ncalculating ruthlessness was<br />\nevidence of a far more<br />\nsophisticated breed of man<br />\nthan I was accustomed to. Zeke<br />\nsaidflat out he didn't have time<br />\nfor girls. I decided immediately I would become the woman<br />\nhe needed, the backbone for his<br />\nbrilliant academic career.<br />\nSo, I won him. I sat next to<br />\nhim during 14-hour marathons<br />\nin the Hut. I knit him sweaters<br />\nto wear on chilly C-Level.<br />\n<br />\nWhen he finally made it out of<br />\nlab tired and hungry at 9:00<br />\np.m., he came home to a hot<br />\nsupper and my smile. It didn't<br />\nmatter that my friends went out<br />\nat night to frat parties and the<br />\nRat. What's a trivial evening of<br />\nlaughter and drinking when<br />\nZeke<br />\nmight<br />\nhave<br />\na<br />\nbreakthrough<br />\nbalancing<br />\nchemical equations?<br />\nThere were hard times mixed in with the good. Some<br />\nnights he'd come back from his<br />\nMed School job and hold me<br />\nagainst his acetone-scented<br />\nskin. I nearly died with desire.<br />\nBut a few minutes later he<br />\nwould be out the door to the<br />\nHut and I'd be left alone,<br />\ncaressing the textbooks of his I<br />\nlined up on the other side of my<br />\nfuton. As I passed my hands<br />\nover their hard cracked surfaces<br />\nI thought longingly of my premed and knew at least he<br />\nwasn't in another woman's<br />\nhands.<br />\nSleeping with Zeke was a<br />\nwhole different problem. I'm<br />\nkind of shy to talk about this<br />\nstuff, mainly because Zeke<br />\nthinks it's immoral (distracts<br />\nhim from studying). The first<br />\ntime he stayed over he insisted<br />\non leaving the room while I<br />\ndisrobed and only came back<br />\nwhen I swore I was wearing a<br />\nsheet. Then he fell asleep and<br />\nrolled around, muttering<br />\nsomething like 'Don't touch my<br />\ntest tube!' He woke up in a cold<br />\nsweat when his beeper went off.<br />\nPulling on his Levis, he was out<br />\nthe door on call for the First<br />\nAid Squad.<br />\nWaiting up nights was always<br />\nthe worst part. There I was with<br />\ncountles cups of Sanka praying<br />\nmy love would return once<br />\nagain to my side. His commitment to society's well-being<br />\nmoved me to tears, but I<br />\ncouldn't help wishing Zeke<br />\nwould spend a teensy bit more<br />\ntime with me.<br />\nThings got worse junior year.<br />\n\"Deirdre, I scored 20 points<br />\nbelow class aye,\" he muttered<br />\ntersely one afternoon on the<br />\nMed School Shuttle. \"We're<br />\nthrough for as long as it takes<br />\nto get my life back together.\"<br />\nI begged and pleaded with<br />\nhim. I loped alongside as he<br />\nsprinted the Remsen-Mudd<br />\nRun, begging him to remember<br />\nall the good times. The time I<br />\nran his experiments so he could<br />\nbone up for the Calc III exam.<br />\nThe time I drove him to the<br />\nMCAT's at 4:00 a.m. so he<br />\ncould sit outside the building<br />\nand get in the mood. All the<br />\ntimes I wrote CAL poems for<br />\nhim.<br />\n<br />\nI finally got him back when<br />\nI dropped to my knees in the<br />\nmiddle of Levering. \"Zeke,\" I<br />\ncried, \"I'm dying. You can't<br />\nleave me.\"<br />\ninstantly<br />\nwas<br />\nZeke<br />\nfascinated. With my amazing<br />\nlack of symptoms, he was sure<br />\nI had a strange new disease.<br />\nWith close research, he could<br />\nwrite a paper which would get<br />\nhim in the Flex-Med program.<br />\nHe started to treat me with<br />\nrespect. As for myself, I was<br />\njust glad to have him finally<br />\nplay doctor with me. I was in<br />\nheaven.<br />\nMy problem is this. Zeke has<br />\nmed school interviews this fall.<br />\nOf course, this is the most important moment in our lives.<br />\nZeke's hard work has paid off<br />\nand a brilliant future full of station wagons, Chippendale furniture and home computers<br />\nwaits in the wings.<br />\nThe tragedy is Zeke can't<br />\nreally sit through these interviews. Something I forgot to<br />\nmention earlier is his phobia.<br />\nHe has a real dread of people<br />\nin business suits, especially if<br />\nthey wear gold tie pins. Matching cufflinks have him on the<br />\nfloor. Zeke can function<br />\nperfectly in his day-to-day<br />\nworld since all the grownups<br />\ndown at the Lab wear white<br />\ncoats. I've seen him get queasy<br />\nwhen Steve Muller shook his<br />\nhand, so I know he will be in<br />\ntrouble with a situation as formal as the Med School Interview. What can we do? He's<br />\nflying up to Harvard<br />\nin one week! Whatever you say,<br />\ndon't bother to suggest dropping Zeke. Although I know he<br />\nis bad news, I can't stop loving<br />\nthat man.<br />\nDesperately Yours,<br />\nDeirdre X.<br />\n<br />\nThere must be a few people<br />\nout there who could help Deirdre more than a trite and tacky<br />\nyellow journalist can.

A<br />\nportion of the text from that<br />\nconversation follows.<br />\nN-L: In terms of student involvement, community involvement, financial profits made,<br />\nand an improved Hopkinscommunity relationship, how<br />\nsuccessful do you think Spring<br />\nFair '85 was?<br />\nVogelbaum: I think we'll try<br />\nto address our response to that<br />\nquestion one point at a time.<br />\nFirst, I think that student involvement was very successful<br />\nin the Fair. There were a lot of<br /><br />\nare helping these students out<br />\nwho normally would not have<br />\nany role in the Fair aside from<br />\nbeing a part of the crowd.<br />\nQuayle: It seemed to us to be<br />\nsuch a good thing to be a little<br />\ndifferent from the way Hopkins<br />\ntends to be so often. Lots of<br />\nstudents who weren't forced to<br />\nbe involved in something actually came out and did it and<br />\nhad a good time.<br />\nN-L: How was community<br />\ninvolvement this year, particularily in the area of attendance relative to years past?<br />\nVogelbaum: There's no way<br />\nof calculating the number of<br />\npeople.<br />\nQuayle: On the quads, a lot<br />\nof people felt that there were<br />\nnot as many people, but over<br />\non Garland field, there were a<br />\nlot of people in addition to the<br />\nFair Games participants. A lot<br />\nof people were playing frisbee,<br />\nor sitting under trees, or just<br />\nrelaxing. So I think that that<br />\nwas able to take the tension of<br />\nthe crowds off just the quads<br />\nand the beer garden.<br /><br />\nWe tried to accommodate every student group that came to us with a<br />\nrequest.<br />\nMike Vogelbaum<br /><br />\nJess Bunshaft<br /><br />\nBryce Quayle and Mike Vogelbaum, co-chairmen of Spring Fair '85. Quayle and Vogelbaum discussed the<br />\nsuccess of the Fair with the News-Letter on Tuesday.<br /><br />\nN-L: Some faculty members<br />\nhave expressed concern that the<br />\nFair conflicts with studies,<br />\nespecially on Friday afternoons. How legitimate do you<br />\nthink those concerns are?<br />\nVogelbaum: The Fair has<br />\nmade great concessions to the<br />\nfaculty because of these concerns. In the past, there was<br />\ncontinuous music, there was<br />\nmusic on Fridays, there was<br />\nrock 9n roll music on Fridays.<br />\nThere is none of this now. I<br />\ndon't feel that the Fair interferes with studies at all now.<br />\nAside from the chairmen of the<br />\nFair. They did have problems.<br />\nQuayle: I think the biggest<br />\nthing is in the scheduling of the<br />\nweekend. It's best if it's the<br />\nweekend after all classes are<br />\nover, as it was last year. If it<br />\ncan't be worked out, there's<br />\nnothing we can do about it.<br />\nVogelbaum: Our schedule<br />\nhas to be set around things like<br />\nhome lacrosse games and<br />\nMCAT's. Unfortunately, we've<br />\nbeen on the same weekend as<br />\nthe Walk-a-thon for the last<br />\ntwo years. It causes trouble in<br />\ngetting things like snow fencing<br />\nand city booths. But there are<br />\nmany other factors that have to<br />\nbe taken into account. I really<br />\ndon't think that the Fair intereferes with classes at this<br /><br />\nstudent groups involved in soda<br />\nN-L: What aspects of the<br />\nsales, assorted beverage sales, Fair do you think went the<br />\nsecurity, trash, and the other smoothest this year?<br />\naspects of the Fair in which<br />\nQuayle: I think during the<br />\nthey have traditionally been in- Fair, all the committees and all<br />\nvolved. We tried to accommodate the chairmen were very well<br />\nevery student group that came coordinated. Everything ran<br />\nto us with a request. This meant rather smoothly because we<br />\ngoing to sources such as ARA were able to keep in contact<br />\nto create new food booths. This with each other and everyone<br />\nmeant going to food vendors knew pretty much what had to<br />\nthat already expressed an interest be done. And, because of that<br />\nin the Fair and asking them if coordination that we prepared<br />\nthey would use student helpers for beforehand as well as keepto get a reduction in their booth ing on top of things during the<br />\nfee.

It<br />\nstudent involvement is concern- was very hard for us to piece<br />\ned, the Fair Games brought a<br />\nlot of students in that would<br />\nnot have normally been involved in the Fair. There were a lot<br />\nof independent teams of just<br />\npeople who put teams together<br />\nas well as the teams of different<br />\ngroups and fraternities and<br />\nsororities. Everybody out there<br />\nhad a very good time and seemed to enjoy themselves, and a<br />\nlot of people came out to<br />\nwatch.<br />\nVogelbaum: They had a<br />\ngreat time. It was a great crowd<br />\ndown there, especially Saturday together what each of the com- point. I think the only concern<br />\nwhen we had thirty-two teams<br />\nmittees was supposed to do.

There<br />\nwere no big fights, there were no problems with large amounts of theft,<br />\netc. .. .<br />\n\u2014Bryce Quayle<br />\nbeen a concern of the NewsLetter more than anyone else.<br />\nI think that what people fail to<br />\nunderstand is that the Fair is<br />\ncompletely self-supported. In<br />\norder for the Fair to do activities for students, the Fair<br />\nhas to raise money. The only<br />\nway the Fair has to raise money<br />\nis through selling food spots,<br />\nfood spaces, and arts and crafts<br />\nspaces. In order to increase the<br />\namount of activities for<br />\nstudents during the day and at<br />\nnight, we have to raise more<br />\nmoney. The costs of a lot of the<br />\nactivities that we do have have<br />\nincreased, whereas the rents<br />\nthat we charge cannot increase<br />\nvery much because we are in<br />\ncompetition with other<br />\nfestivals. This year we increased the size of our booths for<br />\narts and crafts spaces from<br />\n10x6 to 10x10. But we didn't increase the booth fee. And if we<br />\nhad, we probably would have<br />\nlost a lot of vendors becasue<br />\nthere were a lot of other<br />\nfestivals going on this weekend<br />\nthat charged about that much.<br />\nI think that by getting student<br />\ngroups to work with the vendors and by initiating activities<br /><br />\nthrough the day one of the people delivering the booths told us<br />\nthat there was a fire at the<br />\nwarehouse where they keep the<br />\nbooths. We didn't think too<br />\nmuch of it because he didn't<br />\nseem so concerned. Later on in<br />\nthe day, we found out that it<br />\nwas a pretty big fire. We tried<br />\ncalling the warehouse. All we<br />\ngot was a busy signal. We<br />\nthought they had taken the<br />\nphone off the hook. Well,<br />\nLaura Kaufman, one of our<br />\nfood co-chairmen, works down<br />\nin the mayor's office, so she<br />\nhad several connections whom<br />\nshe called. She finally found<br />\nout that it was a pretty serious<br />\nfire and that just about<br />\neverything was in the process of<br />\nbeing destroyed. At that point<br />\nwe really couldn't be sure how<br />\nmany booths would be left for<br />\nus because all that we knew was<br />\nthat everything was burning. So<br />\nwe started calling around trying<br />\nto rent booths. Eventually,<br />\nthough, we found out that there<br />\nwere some booths saved. The<br />\nnext morning, Laura and I<br />\ndrove out to the warehouse.

We found that a lot<br />\nof the booths we were to get<br />\nwere not even in the warehouse,<br />\nbut were in a seperate lot. We<br />\ntalked to several of the people<br />\ndown there and they said that<br />\nthey would be getting them to<br />\nus, So it turned out that we<br />\nunderestimated the number of<br />\nbooths that we would need. We<br />\nhave to order these booths in<br />\nFebruary, but we don't know<br />\nhow many we need until April,<br />\nso we ended up needing more<br />\nthan we orginally thought that<br />\nwe needed. All the stages in the<br />\nwarehouse were burned, but we<br />\ndid manage to get four of the<br />\nfive that we had requested. To<br />\ntell you the truth, I think<br />\nMayor Schaefer is really<br />\nresponsible for saving us and<br />\ngetting the booths that we needed. The first thing that we were<br />\ntold was that Mayor Schaefer<br />\nhad visited the warehouse and<br />\nsaid that all requests would be<br />\nhonored, and that City workers<br />\nwould be on overtime until all<br />\nrequests were honored. So it<br />\nwas really the fact that the City and Mayor Schaefer decided<br />\nto honor the requests for the<br />\nbooths that we were able to get<br />\nthem at all.<br />\nN-L: How well do you think<br />\nsecurity went this year?<br />\nQuayle: Security went very<br />\nwell this year. Both our student<br />\ngroups (whom we hire for<br />\nsecurity in parking, on the<br />\nquads, and in the beer garden)<br />\nas well as Hopkins Security did<br />\na good job. Specfically, Major<br />\nLarkin said that as far as security was concerned, it was the<br />\nbest Fair that he's seen since<br />\nhe's been here.<br />\nVogelbaum: He started telling us that on Saturday and<br />\ncontinued through Sunday.<br />\nQuayle: It's almost surprising that there were no major incidents whatsoever. There were<br />\nno big fights, there were no<br />\nproblems with large amounts of<br />\ntheft, etc....<br /><br />\nQuayle: It was disappointing<br />\nin that we worked on it a lot to<br />\nbegin with. In the beginning of<br />\nthe semester, we put a lot of<br />\ntime and effort in trying to<br />\nsecure bands for a concert,<br />\nalthough, I think as far as I'm<br />\nconcerned, and for just about<br />\neveryone who worked on the<br />\nFair, I don't think there was<br />\nanything lacking this weekend<br />\nbecause there was no concert.<br />\nVogelbaum: I started on the<br />\nphone on January 2nd, the day<br />\nI got back, trying to find out<br />\nwhat bands were available. It<br />\nwas really the only thing that<br />\nwe could do at that point. Mary<br /><br />\nEverything ran rather smoothly<br />\nbecause we were able to keep in contact with each other and everyone<br />\nknew pretty much what had to be<br />\ndone.<br />\n\u2014Mike Vogelbaum<br />\nEllen Porter warned us from<br />\nthe very beginning that we probably wouldn't be able to do a<br />\nconcert, as did last year's Fair<br />\nchairmen. In fact, I went down<br />\nto the University of Virginia<br />\nand saw Sharon Crane, one of<br />\nlast year's Fair chairmen. When<br />\nI told her that we were working<br />\non getting a concert, she said,<br />\n\"I warned you not to do that.\"<br />\nI disagree. I'm glad that we<br />\ntried because we did learn a lot<br />\nof lessons, lessons that I think<br />\nwill really help the Spring Fair<br />\nchairmen next year.<br />\nN-L: That leads into the next<br />\nquestion I was going to ask.<br />\nHow feasible do you think a<br />\nconcert at Spring Fair will be<br />\nnext year?<br />\nVogelbaum: The biggest problem with the concert is the size<br />\nof Shriver. It only hold a thousand people. And Hopkins<br />\nstudents, I don't blame them,<br /><br />\nWhat I'm thinking of is something<br />\nalong the lines of having different<br />\npeople, maybe different chairmen,<br />\ndealing with different aspects of the<br />\nFair rather than both dealing with all<br />\nthe aspects of the Fair.<br />\nBryce Quayle<br />\nVogelbaum: We were quite<br />\nsurprised because when we<br />\nheard the weather reports and<br />\nheard that it was going to be a<br />\nvery hot weekend, we were of<br />\ncourse happy that we were going to have the good weather,<br />\nbut we were afraid that that the<br />\nheat would really cause some<br />\nproblems, but it didn't. It really didn't. It was a very mellow<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nN-L: Was the lack of a concert this year a disappointment<br />\nto you?<br /><br />\nvarious different companies to<br />\nsponsor such an event after we<br />\nhad our theme decided and<br />\nafter we got things rolling. But<br />\nit was really too late to get<br />\nthrough the paperwork and the<br />\nred tape of approaching a large<br />\ncorporation to try to sponsor<br />\nsomething like that.<br />\nVogelbaum: Let me add to<br />\nthat. It wasn't until later that<br />\nwe realized that we would have<br />\nto approach a large company to<br />\nget a large sponsorship. We<br />\nwent through the proposed<br />\nbudget for the Cyndi Lauper<br />\nconcert last year, and that had<br />\nsome small sponsorhips and it<br /><br />\ndon't want to pay a lot for a<br />\nconcert at Hopkins. People will<br />\npay ten or fifteen dollars to see<br />\nsomeone play down at the Civic<br />\nCenter, but they won't pay<br />\nseven or eight dollars to see<br />\nanyone play here.<br />\nQuayle: The biggest thing<br />\nthat needs to be done for a concert to be pulled off is that funding needs to be found. We<br />\ndidn't have time this year. We<br />\nweren't selected early enough to<br />\nseek that funding from the very<br />\nbeginning. We approached<br /><br />\nhad a few other numbers for<br />\npublicity.We then realized that<br />\nthat concert probably would<br />\nhave lost a lot of money. It just<br />\ndidn't budget for everything,<br />\nand some of the sponsorships<br />\nweren't actually secure.<br />\nN-L: What reccomendations<br />\nwould you make or will you<br />\nmake to the Spring Fair<br />\nchairmen next year given the<br />\nopportunity?<br />\nVogelbaum: Well, we will<br />\nhave that opprtunity since we<br />\ndo write up a final report. And<br />\nwe have every committee chairman contribute to that report.<br />\nQuayle: I think the main reccomendation that I'll make has<br />\nto do with the structure of the<br />\nFair, executive people, and just<br />\nMike and I and our treasurer<br />\nand the committee chairmen. I<br />\nthink that as the Fair is continuing to grow, more and more<br />\nbureauocracy tends to come<br />\nabout. We have more and more<br />\ncommittees and more people<br />\nworking on them, and we have<br />\nto set up more of a definite<br />\nsystem for communication to<br />\nbe most efficient and for people to be kept in contact with<br />\neveryone else. What I'm thinking of is something along the lines<br />\nof having different people,<br />\nmaybe different chairmen,<br />\ndealing with different aspects of<br />\nthe Fair rather than both dealing with all the aspects of the<br />\nFair.<br />\nVogelbaum: I think one reccomendation that I will make is<br />\nthat when the chairmen select<br />\ntheir committee chairmen, they<br />\nshould definitely take into account other activities that these<br />\napplicants are invloved with.<br />\nOne problem that we had this<br />\nyear was that a lot of our<br />\nchairmen were over extended.<br />\nThey had too many other activities, and when it came<br />\naround to two or three weeks<br />\nbefore the Fair, they didn't put<br />\nin as much time as was needed<br />\nto get everything done.<br /><br />\n-mak_<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/9<br /><br />\nFair Fun<br />\nContinues<br />\nInto Night<br /><br />\nBo-Peep, Panther<br />\nVisit Kids At Fair<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br /><br />\nby L.M. Asta<br />\nThis year's Spring Fair night<br />\nentertainment was supposedly<br />\nupgraded to compensate for the<br />\nabsent concert.

In<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion, there was<br />\ndancing to the rock band Jelly<br />\nRoll.<br />\nThree major events were<br />\nscheduled for Saturday night: a<br />\nvideo dance, the Crusty Nostrils<br />\ngoing Hawaiian, and a comedy<br />\nperformance.<br />\n\"The Hawaiian PunchLine\" comedy of the Budweiser<br />\nComedy Tour featured Jeff<br />\nAltman, a Johns Hopkins<br />\nalumnus. Tickets for the show,<br />\nwhich was held in the L/V<br />\nRoom, were sold on a first<br />\ncome, first served basis at the<br />\ndoor.

I feel this way I'll be able to speak<br />\na little more candidly about Hopkins and<br />\nexpress my opinions as my own.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University is an<br />\nincredibly strange place which seems to<br />\napproach undergraduate education in a<br />\nunique manner. That is, there is a<br />\ndefinite concentration upon research<br />\nabove all else. This seems to result in little or no attention to teaching for its own<br />\nsake and in an academic intensity which<br />\nseems to pervade all aspects of<br />\nHomewood life. In addition, there is an<br />\nadmittedly limited social life here. The<br />\ncharacter of the school has changed little during its existence and probably will<br />\nnot change substantially in the future.<br />\nThere are advantages and disadvantages in all of this. The advantages are<br />\nsometimes difficult to see through all the<br />\ngarbage, but they do exist. Many<br />\nstudents come here primarily to prepare<br />\nfor and get into professional schools.<br />\nHopkins is highly successful in this<br />\nrespect; students can and do get into<br />\ngraduate schools without a great deal of<br />\ndifficulty. The lack of a structured social<br />\nenvironment, while annoying to some,<br />\nremoves the pressure of social activity<br />\nfound at many colleges and allows<br />\nundergraduates to build a social life<br />\nwhich suits them, even if they have to<br />\nwork at it. As far as the non-existent<br />\nteaching standards go, students here are<br />\nnot taught anything\u2014they have to learn<br />\nit. Perhaps that isn't such an awful<br />\nsituation.<br />\nAlong with other quirks at Hopkins is<br />\na peculiar approach to student activities<br />\nby the students, of all people. An opportunity exists here to become involved in<br />\npractically any area which strikes your<br />\nfancy. There are very few schools in the<br />\ncountry academically comparable to<br />\nHopkins in which an individual can step<br />\nonto a varsity team, write for the school<br />\npaper or magazine, chair a Student<br />\nCouncil committee, or create an entirely new organization merely by expressing an interest in doing so. However, only a painfully small number of people<br />\nhere look beyond their studies and<br />\ndevote themselves to something extracurricular. This is unfortunate.<br />\nNow that I've shared my philosophy<br />\nof Hopkins, I'd like to speak a little more<br />\nspecifically about the News-Letter itself.<br />\nMost people on this campus see only a<br /><br />\nPractical Implication<br /><br />\nIndifferent benevolence goes to the<br />\nHomewood administration and to the<br />\nStudent Council, led by the debonair Jon<br />\nLana. There were no major screw-ups,<br />\nbut there weren't any miracles either.<br />\nI wish to express my personal appreciation to Mary Ellen Porter, Beth<br />\nCoe, Marge Possidente, Shelley<br />\nAlbrecht, Jeanne Higbee in the student Activities office for putting up with<br />\nmy near insanity throughout the year.<br />\nThey prevented many a major<br />\ncatastrophe.<br />\nFinally, I'd like to thank my staff:<br />\nGregg, Chuck, Kathy, Tammy, Tim,<br />\nEthan, Kristin, Peter, Sujata, Ilysse,<br />\nDonn, Skip, Ed, Miriam, Howard,<br />\nDave, Mary, Glen, Larry, Bill, Bill<br />\nEmeritus, and all the others.

Many of those<br />\noperating in South Africa tend<br />\nto be blue-chip stocks, which<br />\nare stable and constantly make<br />\nprofit. As stability is extremely<br />\nimportant to a university, it is<br />\nlogical that they would invest in<br />\nthese stocks. Some blue-chip<br />\nstocks are IBM, Ford, and<br />\nother huge multinationals.<br />\nHowever, the profits from this<br />\n2807o only constitutes 15.5% of<br />\nthe total revenue, when one<br />\nwould expect a percentage<br />\nhigher than the 2807o.

They<br />\nwere drinking beer in the middle of class. Now I'm not<br />\nagainst drinking beer, since, as<br />\nmany know (especially Dave<br />\nL.), I partake in that delight<br />\nquite often. However, as<br />\nstudents at this school, I think<br />\nwe must show respect not only<br />\nto the professor and to the institution itelf, but to other<br />\nstudents as well. It made me uncomfortable and I'm sure<br />\nothers felt the same. I am<br />\nashamed that I attend a school<br />\nwhere the students have the<br />\nof<br />\naudacity and lack<br />\nthoughtfulness to drink in class.<br />\nWhy did they do this? Was it<br />\npart of some fraternity task?<br />\nWas it a dare by some of their<br />\nfriends? Does it matter? I<br />\ndoubt it. Again, they were just<br />\nproving how young they really<br />\nare.

All that one has to do<br />\nto see that this accusation<br />\nsometimes applies is to read the<br />\ntabloids of the loony tunes left,<br />\nwhich heap praise upon such<br />\nworkers' paradises as Vietnam,<br />\nCuba, and the Soviet Union.<br />\nOne good way to see that the<br />\nstereotype is unfair is to read<br />\nCarlos Franqui's Family Portrait with Fidel, a book written<br />\nby a revolutionary socialist that<br />\nis a blistering condemnation of<br />\nthe present Soviet and Cuban<br />\nsystems.<br />\nCertainly no one can argue<br /><br />\nthat Mr. Franqui is unqualified<br />\nto critique the Cuban revolution. Franqui was an integral<br />\npart of the revolution, both as<br />\na fighter and as editor of<br />\nRevolucion, the newspaper that<br />\nFranqui describes as the<br />\n\"mouthpiece of the revolution.\" The author is the man<br />\nwhose image has been removed from the middle photograph<br />\non the cover of the book; years<br />\nafter therevolution,Castro considered Franqui important and<br />\ndangerous enough to declare<br />\nhim a \"nonperson,\" in the<br />\ntradition of Castro's Soviet<br />\nsponsors. The highly-acclaimed<br />\nPBS show Frontline recently interviewed Franqui as part of its<br />\nspecial segment concerning<br />\nCastro's revolution. William F.<br />\nBuckley, Mr. Capitalism<br />\nhimself, recently told the Sun<br />\nthat he used Franqui as a major source for his latest novel,<br />\nSee You Later, Alligator, which<br />\nconcerns the Cuban revolutionary government.<br />\nThe book gets off to a bad<br /><br />\nExcerpt<br />\n\"The nationalization of<br />\nthe sugar industry was a<br />\ndeath blow for private property.

This guy is<br />\nobviously very impressed with<br />\nhimself, but his never-ending<br />\nstring of flowery metaphors<br />\nand idiotic puns nauseated me.<br />\nFortunately, Franqui's matterof-fact style, while not particularly aesthetic, is much<br />\nmore palatable.<br />\nFor the most part, Mr. Franqui tells his story in<br />\nchronological order, starting<br />\nwith the overthrow of the dictator Batista. He tells the<br />\nfascinating story of how three<br />\nfactions, one pro-Soviet, one<br />\npro-American, and one (Franqui's) pro-independence, arose,<br />\nand how the hard-line proSoviet group won out in the<br />\nend. Franqui gives an insider's<br />\nversion of Castro's rise to dictator and details Castro's<br />\nskillful manipulations. He<br />\ndiscusses the Bay of Pigs incident and the Cuban missile<br />\ncrisis from a Cuban point of<br />\nview. Most importantly, Franqui gives his own version of<br />\nhow individual rights withered<br />\nunder Castro and how, in his<br />\nopinion, the Cuban people<br />\ntraded one elite ruling class for<br />\na new one with new rhetoric.<br />\nhis<br />\nto<br />\naddition<br />\nIn<br />\nchronological account, Franqui<br />\nincludes a section dealing with<br />\nCastro's life and ideology, and<br />\nan appendix containing some<br />\nimportant letters, speeches, and<br />\ninterviews. The appendix provides useful documentation to<br />\naccompany the story.<br />\nThis book has several problems.

Proteins are composed primarily of<br />\nlow atomic mass atoms such as<br />\ncarbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and<br />\nnitrogen. These atoms do not<br />\nreflect the electron beam well,<br />\nthus very high electron energies<br />\nare required to study the protein in detail. However, at high<br />\nenergies, the electron beam<br />\nbegins to destroy the protein<br />\nstudied. This destruction<br />\ncreates broken pieces of the<br />\nmolecule of artifacts and makes<br />\nit difficult to determine whether<br />\nyou are looking at an artifact or<br /><br />\nthe protein. By using an<br />\nelectron-dense label, a lower<br />\nenergy beam can be used since<br />\nthe label easily reflects the electrons and can indicate the position of a particular part of the<br />\nprotein.<br />\nThe electron-dense label<br />\nmust have three primary<br />\ncharacteristics. First, the label<br />\nmust have some chemical structure or functional group that<br />\nallows it to be attached at the<br />\ndesired position of the protein.<br />\nSecond, it must be sufficiently<br />\nelectron-dense so that individual molecules can be seen<br />\neasily in the TEM. Finally, it<br />\nshould be small enough to provide sufficient detail or<br />\nresolution.<br />\nAs an example, one com-<br /><br />\nDave Tardio<br /><br />\nDr. Beer of the Biophysics Department.<br /><br />\nmonly used label is the protein<br />\nferratin. It contains a core of<br />\nover 2000 iron atoms, making<br />\nit easily seen in the TEM. Its<br />\nsize, however, permits a resolution of 200-300 angstroms.<br />\nIn 1978, Bartlett, Bauer, and<br />\nSinger at the University of<br />\nCalifornia developed an<br />\nelectron-dense molecule which<br />\ncould be used for labeling. This<br />\nmolecule contains a core of<br />\neleven gold atoms with the<br />\ndiameter of the core being only 8.2 angstroms. Thus, a label<br />\nbased on this undecagold<br />\ncluster would have a resolution<br />\nin the tens of angstroms (ten<br />\nmillionths of a centimeter).<br />\nThe undecagold cluster<br />\nmolecule used by Dr. Beer at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Department<br />\nof Biophysics is composed of<br />\nthe eleven gold atoms surrounded by an organic shell<br />\ncontaining free amines (-NH).<br />\nThe free amines can be attached to different bifunctional<br />\nmolecules, molecules which can<br />\nbe attached to the amine at one<br />\nend and another structure at the<br />\nother end, or arms which would<br />\nallow it to be labeled to a variety of different functional<br />\ngroups or proteins.<br />\nBefore the undecagold<br />\nmolecule can be used as a label,<br />\ntwo modifications must be<br />\nmade. First, all of the amines<br />\nbut one are blocked by acetylation, which covers the amine,<br /><br />\nperimented with to find the optimum length.<br />\nOne planned use of gold<br />\nlabeling is to investigate protein<br />\nstructure in the electron<br />\nmicroscope. The gold cluster<br />\nwill indicate the position of part<br />\nof the protein. Then several pictures of the protein will be<br />\ntaken using low energy electrons. These pictures will have<br />\na very high background. A<br />\ncomputer can process the pictures, however and eliminate<br />\nthe background. The position<br />\nof the image created by the gold<br />\ncluster would be used to align<br />\nthe pictures of the protein.<br />\nThus, a high resolution picture<br />\nof the protein could be obtained without destroying the<br />\nprotein.<br /><br />\nso only one arm would be attached to the cluster. This<br />\nprevents labeling two proteins<br />\nwith the same molecule. Second, an arm is selected and attached to the gold cluster. This<br />\narm has one end which reacts<br />\nwith the unacetylated amine<br />\nand another end which reacts<br />\nwith the functional group to the<br />\ndesired position on the protein.<br />\nOne important factor in the<br />\nselection of the arm is its<br />\nlength. The shorter the arm, the<br />\nmore accurately the position of<br />\nthe label can be determined.<br />\nHowever, a short arm may be<br />\nphysically blocked by the protein or sterically hindered from<br />\nreacting with the desired functional group. Thus, arms of difmust be ex,ferent lengths<br /><br />\nCommunicating\u2014Just Plain<br />\nEnglish; 1:00p.m.: New Tech<br />\nTimes; 2:00p.m.: The Nature<br />\nPublic TV\u2014Science and<br />\nof Things III; 3:00p.m.: Nova<br />\nNature Programs<br />\n(R)\u2014Whale Watch; 8:00p.m.:<br />\nThe Undersea World of JacChannels 67, 22 Baltimore<br />\nques Cousteau\u2014The Legend<br />\nof Lake Titicaca; 9:00p.m.:<br />\nFri., April 26, 7:30p.m.: Nature (R)\u2014Flight of the<br />\nWild, Wild World of Condor, Part III.<br />\nAnimals\u2014New Americans.<br />\nSun., April 28, 10:00a.m.:<br />\nSat., April 27, 8:30a.m.: The New Literacy: An InOceanus\u2014The Tropic Seas, troduction to Computers\u2014<br />\nMineral Resources; 10:30 Computer Security, Issues<br />\na.m.: Understanding Human and Trends in Computing;<br />\nBehavior\u2014Psychotherapy; 7:00p.m.: The Living Planet:<br />\n1 2:0 Op.m.:Exploring<br />\nContinued on Page 16<br />\nLanguage: Thinking, Writing,<br /><br />\nHighlights<br /><br />\nGRADUATE STUDENTS CAN PICK UP<br />\nSOME EXTRA CREDIT IN NEW YORK.<br />\nIt can be difficult to establish credit while you're still in school.

White,<br />\nJr. Athletic Center, federal<br />\nagents moved in Monday and<br />\narrested Hopkins head basketball coach Ed \"Nappy\" Doherty and assistant coach Lee<br />\n\"Happy\" Horowitz. Tuesday,<br />\nthe two were arraigned in<br />\nfederal court on multiple<br />\ncharges including point shaving, illegal recruiting, and<br />\ncorruption.<br />\n\"I was shocked,\" said<br />\ndepartment secretary Jane<br />\nSmoot, who witnessed the arrest by \"three men in dark blue<br />\nsuits.\" Horowitz, who was<br />\nbusy adjusting the large<br />\nschedule board in his office at<br />\nthe time, reportedly resisted arrest and had to be subdued by<br />\nforce. Both he and Doherty<br />\nwere handcuffed, as they were<br />\ndescribed in a federal APB as<br />\nbeing \"armed and dangerous.\"<br />\nDoherty especially is known for<br />\nsudden and extreme outbursts<br />\nof excitement.<br />\nAccording to Justice Department official Nick Nikic, the<br />\narrests were the culmination of<br />\na long investigation involving<br />\ncorruption in Hopkins basketball. \"We have documented<br />\nevidence of point shaving of<br />\nunprecedented magnitude,\" he<br />\nsaid in a prepared statement.<br />\n\"We have also uncovered over<br />\ntwenty instances of gross<br />\nrecruiting violations.\"<br />\nWhen asked to elaborate,<br />\nNikic unloaded a suitcase of<br />\ndocuments and photos. \"We<br />\nestimate that Doherty and<br />\nHorowitz have earned over $2<br /><br />\nmillion in illicit funds from this<br />\noperation. Point shaving alone<br />\naccounted for approximately<br />\n$1.7 million.\"<br />\nSpecifically, Nikic cited the<br />\nBlue Jays' 82-44 loss to<br />\nWidener on February 2 this<br />\nyear. The betting line favored<br />\nHopkins by 6 points. Doherty,<br />\nas alleged by the Justice<br />\npurposely<br />\nDepartment,<br />\ndisrupted the Blue Jay offense<br />\nand refused to replace players<br />\nin foul trouble, reducing an early Hopkins lead and easily falling below the point spread.<br />\nThe coaches' take from that<br />\ngame alone, according to Nikic,<br />\nwas over $300,000. Half of this<br />\nwas split by the two, and half<br />\nwas channeled into a bogus<br />\nsummer camp which Horowitz<br />\nsupposedly operates in New<br />\nEngland.<br />\n\"I can't believe it,\" said<br />\nsophomore power forward<br />\nSteve Mitchell. \"I thought that<br />\nwe just got blown away night<br />\nafter night. I never thought that<br />\nshaving was involved.\"<br />\nDespite the Jays' 8-13 record<br />\nthis season, informed sources<br />\nclaim that Doherty and<br />\nHorowitz were successful by<br />\ndisplaying the Blue Jays' obvious individual talent, thus<br />\nswinging the betting line in their<br />\nfavor. On game nights,<br />\nhowever, the two made sure<br />\nthat the contest would not<br />\nresult in a Blue Jay win.<br />\nAs for the counts of<br />\nrecruiting, Nikic presented the<br />\ntestimony of several high school<br />\nseniors who claimed that<br />\nDoherty offered them bonuses<br />\nof \"cars and luscious Hopkins<br />\nwomen\" in exchange for a<br /><br />\nsignature on a letter of intent.<br />\n\"Oh, he said I could have<br />\nanything,\" said Joe Piazza<br />\nfrom the Bronx, New York. \"I<br />\nwas promised booze, cars, and<br />\nloose women. When it cane to<br />\nHopkins, however, I found<br />\nnone of these. The locker room<br />\nwasn't even carpeted, and we<br />\nwere promised a full stereo<br />\nsystem.\"<br />\nEvidently, such illegal<br />\nrecruiting schemes backfired<br />\nwhen recruits actually came to<br />\nHomewood. Though five<br />\nfreshmen \"were almost think-<br /><br />\ning about coming,\" said junior<br />\ncaptain Ralph Horne, the Jays<br />\nplayed the 1984-85 season<br />\nwithout freshmen.<br />\nAt a press conference<br />\nWednesday<br />\nafternoon,<br />\nHopkins Athletic Director Bob<br />\nScott expressed his support for<br />\nthe two coaches. \"I am fully<br />\nassured of the innocence of<br />\nNappy and Happy,\" he said.<br />\n\"I want to assure you that there<br />\nis no doubt in my mind.

The proposal to adopt<br />\nfuchsia as the official sorority<br />\ncolor, raised by Minister of<br />\nPropaganda Eileen Fitzgerald,<br />\npassed unanimously among<br />\nthose present.

Being the<br />\nnumber one premed was<br />\nsomething which took a lot out<br />\nof a girl, but it was everything<br /><br />\nshe wanted to give. As her<br />\nslender foot stepped down on<br />\nthe marble, however, it skidded on a puddle of spilled coffee. With a scream she toppled<br />\nacross the steps and landed<br />\nacross Sebastian's legs. Her<br />\nmole cell write-up went flying<br />\nand she looked up in horror to<br />\nmeet Sebastian's steely blue<br />\neyes.<br />\n\"Walk much?\" he inquired<br />\nsoftly.<br />\n\"Damn it!\" Victoria exclaimed. \"What's happened to<br />\nmy lab?\" As she tried to sit up,<br />\nbreasts heaving, Sebastian\"s<br />\neyes raked every inch of her exposed creamy flesh.<br />\n\"What the hell do you think<br />\nyou're doing!\" Victoria yanked her skirt down, but not<br />\nbefore Sebastian had an eyeful<br />\nof black lace.<br />\n\"Look, you fell over me,\" he<br />\nobjected.<br />\n\"But you tripped me and<br />\nwrecked my lab!\" Victoria<br />\nstumbled to her feet, her soft<br />\nraven locks hitting against<br />\nSebastian's face. He caught his<br />\nbreath at the resolute set of her<br />\nheart-shaped face. Her passion<br />\nfor homework was like nothing<br />\nhe had ever seen.<br />\n\"What are you, some premed?\" he said witheringly.<br />\n\"And proud of it!\" Victoria<br />\nscrambled around, picking up<br />\npapers, as Sebastian made no<br />\neffort to help. A few lacrosse<br />\nbuddies came up behind him<br />\nand started laughing at Vic-<br /><br />\ntoria's obvious distress. She no tomorrow.<br />\nturned, violet eyes flashing fire.<br />\nAfter three beers she was<br />\n\"Only at Hopkins would I<br />\nfor another and strugglready<br />\nIt<br />\nbelieve cads like you exist.<br />\nthe Great Hall, making<br />\ned<br />\ninto<br />\nin<br />\nflourishes<br />\nseems ignorance<br />\nsure her New Jersey Driver's<br />\nnumbers.\"<br />\nSebastian was laughing open- License and Hopkins I.D. were<br />\nly now, his smokey eyes nar- ready. Thank God she was<br />\nrowed. Victoria noted the legal; it was the only thing gohateful cast of his aristoctratic ing for her besides her Porsche.<br />\nHe was slouched against the<br />\ncheekbones and turned away,<br />\nwrinkling her striking nose.

It<br />\nlies,\" Victoria said. \"Come<br />\ned<br />\nwould make a great story to tell<br />\non.\"<br />\nreason<br />\n.the guys, but for some<br />\nHer manicured fingernails<br />\nhe just shut up.<br />\nLater that night it was Vic- closed like steel around his<br />\ntoria who got the chance to do, beefy forearm, and Sebastian<br />\nsome talking. Her write-up was dragged back into the<br />\nsafely rescued, she was relaxing Pavilion. \"Darling Nikki\"<br />\nin the plush green chairs at a blared from the speakers; VicGlass Pavilion party, talking to toria slipped her arms around<br />\nSebastian and pressed up<br />\nher Militant Comrades.<br />\n\"And you know, guys are all against him. Sebastian heard<br />\nalike,\"she said. She didn't need the chorus of his hooting frat<br />\nto say anymore for them to all brothers in the background and<br />\nstart nodding sympathetically, blushed scarlet.<br />\n\"So, Sebastian, how do you<br />\nThey sat nodding and sighing<br />\nabout the sexual harrassfeel<br />\nwas<br />\nthere<br />\nlike<br />\nbeer<br />\nand drinking<br /><br />\nment policy?\" Victoria asked<br />\nconversationally.<br />\n\"I feel sexually harrassed<br />\nright now. And how do you<br />\nknow my name?\"<br />\n\"How could anyone not<br />\nknow the boy who gives his<br />\nfraternity its reputation? The<br />\nboy most likely to have herpes?<br />\nThe only boy to ever get a D in<br />\nC.A.L.\u2014\"<br />\n\"How did you know that?\"<br />\nhe asked, wounded.<br />\n\"Little WASP boy, I know<br />\neverything.\" Victoria felt the<br />\nhardness of his thighs through<br />\nthe thin material of her dress.<br />\n\"I don't like being called a<br />\nboy, it makes me feel degraded. What's your name,<br />\nanyway? I must have seen you<br />\nin the library.\"<br />\n\"Victoria Levine.\" Her<br />\nbreath was hot in his ear.<br />\n\"Oh,a princess.\" He laughed condescendingly.<br />\n\"Better a JAP than a slave to<br />\none's\u2014\"she<br />\ncoughed<br />\ndelicately\u2014\"hormones.\"<br />\nSebastian's pelvis jerked<br />\naway in embarrassment. Victoria was amused. The boy was<br />\ngoing to be easier to handle<br />\nthan she expected; his cool was<br />\ndropping faster than a junior's<br />\nGPA.<br />\n\"I can't believe you,\" Sebstian muttered in confusion.<br />\n\"Are you a nympho or<br />\nsomething?\"<br />\nSuddenly they found<br />\nthemselves jerked apart and<br /><br />\nNEWS-SLANDERER/7<br /><br />\nA Textbook Case of Love at Johns Hopkins<br />\nstaring into a pair of cold,<br />\nmalachite-colored eyes. It was<br />\nDon Zimmermann, lacrosse<br />\ncoach.<br />\n\"What the hell are you doin'<br />\non the big night before the<br />\nSyracuse game?\" he inquired,<br />\ntugging his polka-dotted tie.<br />\n\"Why, Coach, I'm\u2014Just enjoying a little inspiration.\"<br />\nSebastian replied.<br />\nVictoria's sophistication had<br />\nflown with the night air.<br />\n\"Goodness,\" she blushed.<br />\n\"What chutzpah.\"<br />\n\"It's a big game tomorrow,<br />\nfella,\" Coach said.\"Great day<br />\nto be a Blue Jay.\"<br />\n\"He's quite drunk,\"Victoria<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"Yeah, I think he better get<br />\nsome rest,\"said Coach. \"Great<br />\nday to be a Blue Jay.\"<br />\nBefore she knew it, Victoria<br />\nwas whisked into the Coach's<br />\niron grasp. She gasped to feel<br />\nthe hardness of his thighs<br />\nthrough the thin material of her<br />\ndress.<br />\n\"Hey Coach,\" Sebastian<br />\nprotested ineffectively.<br />\n\"Just joshin' ya, fella.\"<br />\nCoach thrust Victoria back at<br />\nSebastian. \"Have a good time<br />\nand keep your head on<br />\nstraight.\"<br />\nThe two watched Zimmermann move out the door with<br />\neasy grace. Victoria trembled<br />\nwith rage.<br />\n\"That cad broke my nail.\"<br /><br />\nVictoria raised the hand Coach<br />\nhad impulsively grabbed.<br />\n\"Oh, that's just awful,\"<br />\nSebastian said. \"Come, let me<br />\ngive you first aid.\"<br />\nWith one smooth movement<br />\nhe gathered Victoria in his<br />\narms. She shut her eyes in<br />\nagony as he carried her across<br />\nthe Pavilion before the eyes of<br />\nthe BSU, Phi Mu, the<br />\nMilitants, the Sexists, and the<br />\nThroats. She hadn't been so<br />\nembarrassed since her stockings<br />\nran at her Bat Mitzvah.<br />\nSebastian carried her all the<br />\nway up to the Gilman Quad<br />\nbefore gently setting her down<br />\non the grass.<br />\n\"This is where I saw you<br />\nfirst,\" he said gravely. \"For a<br />\nfeminist, you're pretty great.<br />\nI'm wild about your lace.\"<br />\n\"I think we should be<br />\nenemies.\" Victoria's breath<br />\ncame faster.<br />\n\"You're the one who practically made love to me on the<br />\ndance floor,\" Sebastian said.<br />\ntracing patterns over her<br />\ncreamy flesh. Victoria's senses<br />\nwere on fire as his lips moved<br />\nonto her neck. \"Yes,\" she<br />\ncroaked.<br />\nSuddenly they were locked<br />\nagainst each other, senses reeling, everything ringing but the<br />\nGilman clock. They struggled<br />\nfor dominance, for kisses, for<br />\neverything that had been pent<br />\nup too long.

In addition to those<br />\nepistles of bemusement or<br />\nhatred, the occasional plea for<br />\nadvicefalls across my desk. For<br />\nsome mysterious reason, a<br />\ndeceptively perky blonde named Deirdre X. was compelled to<br />\nshare a few traumas with me.<br />\nHer letter arrived in Box 33<br />\nstained with formaldehyde and<br />\ntears. Ifeel her words speak to<br />\ncountless others on this campus, and her dilemma could be<br />\nuniversal.<br />\nDear Sujata,<br />\nYou don't know me, or<br />\nmaybe you do but you just ignore me by staring into your<br />\ncoffee all the time. But you just<br />\nhave to listen, because I'm on<br />\nthe edge. My problem is<br />\nsomething I can't admit to easily, in the face of massive peer<br />\ncontempt. But at a Pre-Meds<br />\nAnonymous meeting last night,<br />\nI realized the first step toward<br />\nrecovery is the recognition of<br />\nthe problem. I don't want to<br />\nrecover, exactly, but I need<br />\nhelp. Or rather he does. You<br />\nsee, lam guilty ofloving a premed.<br />\nOh, I never meant to in the<br />\nfirst place. My mother warned<br />\nme about the kind of boys who<br />\nwould try to get under your<br />\nsweater with a stethoscope. But<br />\nwhen I met Ezekiel all caution<br />\nblew to the wind.<br />\nIt all started one long-ago<br />\nafternoon. As a Writing<br />\nSeminars major, I was scouting<br />\nD-Level for a Jack Kerouac<br />\nnovel and someone cute to<br />\nwrite in my poetry journal<br />\nabout. It was a freak accident<br />\nmeeting Zeke, as he likes to be<br />\ncalledfor short; tall, dark, and<br />\nsquint-eyed and stoopshouldered already. He had the<br />\nmost adorable stutter I ever<br />\nheard. Zeke was in the process<br />\nof hiding the reserve room's<br />\nbiology exams beside some<br />\nSylvia Plath poetry. Hefigured<br />\nno pre-med knew the library<br />\nwent down past C-Level, so he<br />\nwould be able to kick ass on the<br />\nmid-term.<br />\nRight then Ifellfor him, that<br />\ncalculating ruthlessness was<br />\nevidence of a far more<br />\nsophisticated breed of man<br />\nthan I was accustomed to. Zeke<br />\nsaidflat out he didn't have time<br />\nfor girls. I decided immediately I would become the woman<br />\nhe needed, the backbone for his<br />\nbrilliant academic career.<br />\nSo, I won him. I sat next to<br />\nhim during 14-hour marathons<br />\nin the Hut. I knit him sweaters<br />\nto wear on chilly C-Level.<br /><br />\nWhen he finally made it out of<br />\nlab tired and hungry at 9:00<br />\np.m., he came home to a hot<br />\nsupper and my smile. It didn't<br />\nmatter that my friends went out<br />\nat night to frat parties and the<br />\nRat. What's a trivial evening of<br />\nlaughter and drinking when<br />\nZeke<br />\nmight<br />\nhave<br />\na<br />\nbreakthrough<br />\nbalancing<br />\nchemical equations?<br />\nThere were hard times mixed in with the good. Some<br />\nnights he'd come back from his<br />\nMed School job and hold me<br />\nagainst his acetone-scented<br />\nskin. I nearly died with desire.<br />\nBut a few minutes later he<br />\nwould be out the door to the<br />\nHut and I'd be left alone,<br />\ncaressing the textbooks of his I<br />\nlined up on the other side of my<br />\nfuton. As I passed my hands<br />\nover their hard cracked surfaces<br />\nI thought longingly of my premed and knew at least he<br />\nwasn't in another woman's<br />\nhands.<br />\nSleeping with Zeke was a<br />\nwhole different problem. I'm<br />\nkind of shy to talk about this<br />\nstuff, mainly because Zeke<br />\nthinks it's immoral (distracts<br />\nhim from studying). The first<br />\ntime he stayed over he insisted<br />\non leaving the room while I<br />\ndisrobed and only came back<br />\nwhen I swore I was wearing a<br />\nsheet. Then he fell asleep and<br />\nrolled around, muttering<br />\nsomething like 'Don't touch my<br />\ntest tube!' He woke up in a cold<br />\nsweat when his beeper went off.<br />\nPulling on his Levis, he was out<br />\nthe door on call for the First<br />\nAid Squad.<br />\nWaiting up nights was always<br />\nthe worst part. There I was with<br />\ncountles cups of Sanka praying<br />\nmy love would return once<br />\nagain to my side. His commitment to society's well-being<br />\nmoved me to tears, but I<br />\ncouldn't help wishing Zeke<br />\nwould spend a teensy bit more<br />\ntime with me.<br />\nThings got worse junior year.<br />\n\"Deirdre, I scored 20 points<br />\nbelow class aye,\" he muttered<br />\ntersely one afternoon on the<br />\nMed School Shuttle. \"We're<br />\nthrough for as long as it takes<br />\nto get my life back together.\"<br />\nI begged and pleaded with<br />\nhim. I loped alongside as he<br />\nsprinted the Remsen-Mudd<br />\nRun, begging him to remember<br />\nall the good times. The time I<br />\nran his experiments so he could<br />\nbone up for the Calc III exam.<br />\nThe time I drove him to the<br />\nMCAT's at 4:00 a.m. so he<br />\ncould sit outside the building<br />\nand get in the mood. All the<br />\ntimes I wrote CAL poems for<br />\nhim.<br /><br />\nI finally got him back when<br />\nI dropped to my knees in the<br />\nmiddle of Levering. \"Zeke,\" I<br />\ncried, \"I'm dying. You can't<br />\nleave me.\"<br />\ninstantly<br />\nwas<br />\nZeke<br />\nfascinated. With my amazing<br />\nlack of symptoms, he was sure<br />\nI had a strange new disease.<br />\nWith close research, he could<br />\nwrite a paper which would get<br />\nhim in the Flex-Med program.<br />\nHe started to treat me with<br />\nrespect. As for myself, I was<br />\njust glad to have him finally<br />\nplay doctor with me. I was in<br />\nheaven.<br />\nMy problem is this. Zeke has<br />\nmed school interviews this fall.<br />\nOf course, this is the most important moment in our lives.<br />\nZeke's hard work has paid off<br />\nand a brilliant future full of station wagons, Chippendale furniture and home computers<br />\nwaits in the wings.<br />\nThe tragedy is Zeke can't<br />\nreally sit through these interviews. Something I forgot to<br />\nmention earlier is his phobia.<br />\nHe has a real dread of people<br />\nin business suits, especially if<br />\nthey wear gold tie pins. Matching cufflinks have him on the<br />\nfloor. Zeke can function<br />\nperfectly in his day-to-day<br />\nworld since all the grownups<br />\ndown at the Lab wear white<br />\ncoats. I've seen him get queasy<br />\nwhen Steve Muller shook his<br />\nhand, so I know he will be in<br />\ntrouble with a situation as formal as the Med School Interview. What can we do? He's<br />\nflying up to Harvard<br />\nin one week! Whatever you say,<br />\ndon't bother to suggest dropping Zeke. Although I know he<br />\nis bad news, I can't stop loving<br />\nthat man.<br />\nDesperately Yours,<br />\nDeirdre X.<br /><br />\nThere must be a few people<br />\nout there who could help Deirdre more than a trite and tacky<br />\nyellow journalist can. We all<br />\nknow pre-meds; some of them<br />\nare our best friends, the kind<br />\nwho add for us in Eddie's<br />\ncheck-out lane. What is a med<br />\nschool interview really like?
