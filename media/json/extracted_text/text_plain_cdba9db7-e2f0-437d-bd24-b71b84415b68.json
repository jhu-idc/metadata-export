He<br />\nspoke of the new role of the<br />\nUnited Nations\u2014a role dedicated to meditation, as before,<br />\nbut with new emphasis on the<br />\nnon-political approaches to the<br />\nachieving of a harmonious<br />\nworld.<br />\nTraces Relations With U.S.S.R.<br />\nThe Secretary-General began<br />\nhis lecture with a tracing of<br />\npast United States-Russia relations.

While he<br />\nwas decidedly biased in favor<br />\nof the young neutral nations,<br />\n<br />\nU THANT at Shriver Hall last Sund<br />\n<br />\nhe did give an insight into neutralism as being the young nations' idealism: that is, that<br />\nthe young nations were concerned for the peace of the<br />\nworld and did not want to<br />\nheighten tensions by aligning<br />\nthemselves.<br />\n<br />\nOut of the Shades<br />\nHe made an interesting remark about Kennedy's intervention for a neutral Laos,<br />\ninteresting because Dwight Eisenhower, some might contend,<br />\ndestroyed this same neutral<br />\nLaos in his efforts to gain a new<br />\nAmerican ally there. This remark also fitted well into U<br />\nThant's<br />\ngeneral<br />\nproposition<br />\nthat the West, meaning the<br />\nUnited States, had dwelt too<br />\nlong upon getting an aligned<br />\nworld, and not enough upon a<br />\nworld of shades, of not so black<br />\nand white relationships.<br />\nThe United States, he suggested, should profit from the<br />\nRussian attempts at coexisting<br />\nand not try to get ironclad<br />\nagreements. And, he said, the<br />\nUnited States must \"function<br />\nto create a frame in which the<br />\nyoung nations may choose freely.\"<br />\nCooperation In Space<br />\nHe was optimistic though<br />\nnever smiling as he mentioned<br />\nthe growing spirit of compromise in outer space diplomacy,<br />\n<br />\nin disarmament, and in the<br />\nCuban imbroglio. Perhaps Berlin would be compromised, he<br />\nhoped. And strangely enough,<br />\nafter all the brotherhood was<br />\nsaid and done, Mr. Thant reminded the audience, \"that no<br />\nman of good will can be neutral.\"<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nIn his final remarks U Thant<br />\nspoke more as a Burmese than<br />\na world arbitrator. He said that<br />\nthe world will not live in harmony until the economic plight<br />\nof the underdeveloped African<br />\nand Asian countries is eliminated. These countries, the<br />\nSecretary - General continued,<br />\nmust be relieved of the stigma<br />\nof poverty which inhibits human progress. The world, and,<br />\nespecially the United States<br />\nmust take a more non-political<br />\nview of the world situation and<br />\nof the United Nations.<br />\nAccording to Thant the world<br />\nshould recognize the extra-political, humanitarian nature of<br />\nthe United Nations. Along these<br />\nsame lines, he recommended<br />\nthat the United States re-assess<br />\nher success with a material,<br />\ndemocratic - progress . philosophy, return to the forefathers<br />\nconfidence, and send out foreign aid.<br />\nHis Honor concluded the lecture with Washington's time(Continued on Page 7)<br />\n<br />\n1) \u2022<br />\n<br />\n'I' Nem<br />\n<br />\n4Erttrr<br />\n:<br />\n22<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, DECEMBER 7, 1962<br />\n<br />\nVOL.

The officers agree, as they were quoted<br />\nin the article, on a common goal:<br />\n''to abolish the abominable lack<br />\nof school spirit, and to emphasize the freshman class and<br />\nundergraduate students.\" The<br />\nwriter's sarcastic remark, \"For<br />\nthis we should all be glad and<br />\nrise from our chairs of glum<br />\napathy into a cloud of relaxing<br />\noptitnism,\" merely mocks a<br />\nworthy cause. Why don't you<br />\ngive us a chance? If the officers<br />\nhad the support of the press in<br />\nthis cause, their efforts would<br />\nnot be in vain.

He<br />\nspoke of the new role of the<br />\nUnited Nations\u2014a role dedicated to meditation, as before,<br />\nbut with new emphasis on the<br />\nnon-political approaches to the<br />\nachieving of a harmonious<br />\nworld.<br />\nTraces Relations With U.S.S.R.<br />\nThe Secretary-General began<br />\nhis lecture with a tracing of<br />\npast United States-Russia relations. The audience sat through<br />\nhis assertion that Russian Stahad<br />\nnow<br />\nmilitancy<br />\nlinist<br />\nchanged to an amazing Khrushchev peace-loving compromising<br />\nsocialist nation, still competitive<br />\nin economic markets. While he<br />\nwas decidedly biased in favor<br />\nof the young neutral nations,<br /><br />\nU THANT at Shriver Hall last Sund<br /><br />\nhe did give an insight into neutralism as being the young nations' idealism: that is, that<br />\nthe young nations were concerned for the peace of the<br />\nworld and did not want to<br />\nheighten tensions by aligning<br />\nthemselves.<br /><br />\nOut of the Shades<br />\nHe made an interesting remark about Kennedy's intervention for a neutral Laos,<br />\ninteresting because Dwight Eisenhower, some might contend,<br />\ndestroyed this same neutral<br />\nLaos in his efforts to gain a new<br />\nAmerican ally there. This remark also fitted well into U<br />\nThant's<br />\ngeneral<br />\nproposition<br />\nthat the West, meaning the<br />\nUnited States, had dwelt too<br />\nlong upon getting an aligned<br />\nworld, and not enough upon a<br />\nworld of shades, of not so black<br />\nand white relationships.<br />\nThe United States, he suggested, should profit from the<br />\nRussian attempts at coexisting<br />\nand not try to get ironclad<br />\nagreements. And, he said, the<br />\nUnited States must \"function<br />\nto create a frame in which the<br />\nyoung nations may choose freely.\"<br />\nCooperation In Space<br />\nHe was optimistic though<br />\nnever smiling as he mentioned<br />\nthe growing spirit of compromise in outer space diplomacy,<br /><br />\nin disarmament, and in the<br />\nCuban imbroglio. Perhaps Berlin would be compromised, he<br />\nhoped. And strangely enough,<br />\nafter all the brotherhood was<br />\nsaid and done, Mr. Thant reminded the audience, \"that no<br />\nman of good will can be neutral.\"<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nIn his final remarks U Thant<br />\nspoke more as a Burmese than<br />\na world arbitrator. He said that<br />\nthe world will not live in harmony until the economic plight<br />\nof the underdeveloped African<br />\nand Asian countries is eliminated. These countries, the<br />\nSecretary - General continued,<br />\nmust be relieved of the stigma<br />\nof poverty which inhibits human progress. The world, and,<br />\nespecially the United States<br />\nmust take a more non-political<br />\nview of the world situation and<br />\nof the United Nations.<br />\nAccording to Thant the world<br />\nshould recognize the extra-political, humanitarian nature of<br />\nthe United Nations. Along these<br />\nsame lines, he recommended<br />\nthat the United States re-assess<br />\nher success with a material,<br />\ndemocratic - progress . philosophy, return to the forefathers<br />\nconfidence, and send out foreign aid.<br />\nHis Honor concluded the lecture with Washington's time(Continued on Page 7)<br /><br />\n1) \u2022<br /><br />\n'I' Nem<br /><br />\n4Erttrr<br />\n:<br />\n22<br /><br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, DECEMBER 7, 1962<br /><br />\nVOL.

The officers agree, as they were quoted<br />\nin the article, on a common goal:<br />\n''to abolish the abominable lack<br />\nof school spirit, and to emphasize the freshman class and<br />\nundergraduate students.\" The<br />\nwriter's sarcastic remark, \"For<br />\nthis we should all be glad and<br />\nrise from our chairs of glum<br />\napathy into a cloud of relaxing<br />\noptitnism,\" merely mocks a<br />\nworthy cause. Why don't you<br />\ngive us a chance? If the officers<br />\nhad the support of the press in<br />\nthis cause, their efforts would<br />\nnot be in vain. The writer, however,\"seems to be of the opinion<br />\nthat school spirit is a poison to<br />\nbe avoided at all costs.<br />\nBy the term \"school spirit\"<br />\nI do not mean the immature<br />\n\"rah-rah Johnny Hopkins\" type,<br />\nor those outward signs that are<br />\nsupposed to be Indicative of an<br />\nInward feeling for the school.<br />\nNo one can be forced to like the<br />\nschool, but it seems that even<br />\nthose who do so think it<br />\n\"square' to admit it.
