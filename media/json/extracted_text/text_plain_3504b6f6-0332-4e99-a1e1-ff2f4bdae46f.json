Randall, of Lehigh,<br />\nclipped an inch off the pole-vault<br />\nrecord when he went over the bar<br />\nat ii feet 8 inches.<br />\nThere were several fast and hotly<br />\ncontested events, and the meet was<br />\na fitting close to Hopkins' spring<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe 200-yard dash was interesting because of a thrilling finish.<br />\nLloyd had second position until the<br />\nlast 20 yards, but nosed ahead on<br />\na beautiful spurt, making the distance in 22 seconds. Lloyd was<br />\nalso first in the 44o-yard run.<br />\n\"Ben\" Tappan, of Hopkins, won<br />\nboth hurdle events; Swan, of Hopkins, being second in the 120-yard<br />\nevent, and Turner Binford second<br />\nin the 220.<br />\nHarry Wagner won the woyard dash, but the time, toYs seconds, was higher than his usual<br />\nmark.<br />\n\"Freddie\" Lee, running his last<br />\nrace for Hopkins, was first in the<br />\ntwo-mile. He won the event by<br />\nhalf a lap over Burns, of Lehigh.<br />\nAfter the meet, Gerald Connolly<br />\nwas unanimously .selected to captain<br />\nnext year's track and field team.<br />\nHe is the veteran high juniper of<br />\nthe squad, and will succeed Harry<br />\nWagner, who will leave the University this year.<br />\nThe summary:<br />\n<br />\nFor the second time this year the<br />\nlacrosse team triumphed over Harvard, the score being 5 to 4. The<br />\nteam, accompanied by Messrs. W.<br />\nSchmeisser, Wolfe and H. Burgan,<br />\nleft for Boston on Friday evening,<br />\nand in spite of several pillow-fights<br />\nand pajama parades, arrived safely<br />\nat their destination on Saturday<br />\nmorning. After partaking of an<br />\nexcellent feed at the Harvard 'Varsity' Club, the team departed for<br />\nthe stadium to witness part of the<br />\nHarvard-Princeton baseball game<br />\nand the New England Intercollegiate Track Meet.<br />\nThe game was called shortly after<br />\nfour o'clock, and after the ball had<br />\nsee-sawed up and down the field,<br />\nHopkins scored the first tally. This<br />\nwas followed a few minutes later<br />\nby one of ex-Capt. Houck's hard<br />\nshots, which resulted in a second<br />\ngoal. Before the end of the half,<br />\nAbbe, though closely cornered,<br />\nmanaged to slip one past Goalkeeper Sears.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDuring the intermission, the team<br />\nwas encopraged by the presence of<br />\n\"Gil\" Horax, \"Jimmy\" Easter, Ellis Ellicott, T. B. Price and Groundkeeper Chalk.<br />\nHopkins, as usual, started the<br />\nsecond period with a rush, and in<br />\na short time Voshell netted a pretty<br />\ngoal from scrimmage. Harvard<br />\nshowed good fighting qualities and<br />\nbefore the Hopkins defence could<br />\nrecover, Nightingale and Fleming<br />\nboth scored. To even up matters,<br />\nfirst Troxell then Voshell scored<br />\nfor Hopkins. With seven minutes<br />\nto play, Elliott rolled an easy one<br />\npast Sears, who did not see it, making the score 5 to 4, in Hopkins'<br />\nfavor.<br />\nIn spite of strenuous efforts,<br />\nthere was no more scoring by either<br />\nside. One of the features of the<br />\ngame was the splendid work of<br />\nCaptain Sutton, who repeatedly<br />\ncaptured the ball from the Harvard<br />\nattack and carried it past the midfield.<br />\nThe summary':<br />\n<br />\nIoo-Yard Dash\u2014Won by Wagner, J.<br />\nH.

They won nine university prizes, some of them of<br />\ngreat importance \u2014 the Gladstone<br />\nmemorial prize, the Mathew Arnold<br />\nprize for an English essay; the Oldham prize for a classical essay, and<br />\nthe Beit prize in colonial history.<br />\nThe 1913 prizes and honors won<br />\nby Rhodes men last year were more<br />\nnumerous than in any earlier year.<br />\nAn American also won last year,<br />\nfor the first time, the presidency of<br />\nthe Union, the highest undergraduate office. \u2022 In athletics they are<br />\nconspicuous.

In this way the fresh<br />\nfreshman will get his just deserts,<br />\nand the meek one who frequently<br />\ngets more than his share will be<br />\njustly treated. The Student Council should decide the limit of severity of the tasks.

Randall, of Lehigh,<br />\nclipped an inch off the pole-vault<br />\nrecord when he went over the bar<br />\nat ii feet 8 inches.<br />\nThere were several fast and hotly<br />\ncontested events, and the meet was<br />\na fitting close to Hopkins' spring<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe 200-yard dash was interesting because of a thrilling finish.<br />\nLloyd had second position until the<br />\nlast 20 yards, but nosed ahead on<br />\na beautiful spurt, making the distance in 22 seconds.

He won the event by<br />\nhalf a lap over Burns, of Lehigh.<br />\nAfter the meet, Gerald Connolly<br />\nwas unanimously .selected to captain<br />\nnext year's track and field team.<br />\nHe is the veteran high juniper of<br />\nthe squad, and will succeed Harry<br />\nWagner, who will leave the University this year.<br />\nThe summary:<br /><br />\nFor the second time this year the<br />\nlacrosse team triumphed over Harvard, the score being 5 to 4. The<br />\nteam, accompanied by Messrs. W.<br />\nSchmeisser, Wolfe and H. Burgan,<br />\nleft for Boston on Friday evening,<br />\nand in spite of several pillow-fights<br />\nand pajama parades, arrived safely<br />\nat their destination on Saturday<br />\nmorning. After partaking of an<br />\nexcellent feed at the Harvard 'Varsity' Club, the team departed for<br />\nthe stadium to witness part of the<br />\nHarvard-Princeton baseball game<br />\nand the New England Intercollegiate Track Meet.<br />\nThe game was called shortly after<br />\nfour o'clock, and after the ball had<br />\nsee-sawed up and down the field,<br />\nHopkins scored the first tally. This<br />\nwas followed a few minutes later<br />\nby one of ex-Capt. Houck's hard<br />\nshots, which resulted in a second<br />\ngoal. Before the end of the half,<br />\nAbbe, though closely cornered,<br />\nmanaged to slip one past Goalkeeper Sears.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDuring the intermission, the team<br />\nwas encopraged by the presence of<br />\n\"Gil\" Horax, \"Jimmy\" Easter, Ellis Ellicott, T. B. Price and Groundkeeper Chalk.<br />\nHopkins, as usual, started the<br />\nsecond period with a rush, and in<br />\na short time Voshell netted a pretty<br />\ngoal from scrimmage. Harvard<br />\nshowed good fighting qualities and<br />\nbefore the Hopkins defence could<br />\nrecover, Nightingale and Fleming<br />\nboth scored. To even up matters,<br />\nfirst Troxell then Voshell scored<br />\nfor Hopkins. With seven minutes<br />\nto play, Elliott rolled an easy one<br />\npast Sears, who did not see it, making the score 5 to 4, in Hopkins'<br />\nfavor.<br />\nIn spite of strenuous efforts,<br />\nthere was no more scoring by either<br />\nside. One of the features of the<br />\ngame was the splendid work of<br />\nCaptain Sutton, who repeatedly<br />\ncaptured the ball from the Harvard<br />\nattack and carried it past the midfield.<br />\nThe summary':<br /><br />\nIoo-Yard Dash\u2014Won by Wagner, J.<br />\nH.

They won nine university prizes, some of them of<br />\ngreat importance \u2014 the Gladstone<br />\nmemorial prize, the Mathew Arnold<br />\nprize for an English essay; the Oldham prize for a classical essay, and<br />\nthe Beit prize in colonial history.<br />\nThe 1913 prizes and honors won<br />\nby Rhodes men last year were more<br />\nnumerous than in any earlier year.<br />\nAn American also won last year,<br />\nfor the first time, the presidency of<br />\nthe Union, the highest undergraduate office. \u2022 In athletics they are<br />\nconspicuous.

Freshmen should not be boisterous, talk loudly, or- make unnecessary noises in or about the<br />\nbuildings.<br />\n2. At no time during the year<br />\nshould freshmen ride in the elevators.<br />\n3. Freshmen should show respect<br />\nto upper classmen by giving way<br />\nto them in all reasonable ways.<br />\n4. On or before the day of the<br />\nSt. John's football game, freshmen<br />\nshould not wear derby. hats or tan<br />\nshoes.<br />\n5. Until Commemoration Day,<br />\nfreshmen should not wear loud<br />\nsocks, vests, or ties, or shirts with<br />\nsoft collars.<br />\n6. Freshmen should not wear<br />\nUniversity colors in any form (permissible when representing the University in athletics).<br />\n7. Freshmen should not smoke<br />\npipes or cigars on University property.<br />\n8. Freshmen should always carry<br />\nmatches as a favor to upper classmen.<br />\n9. Unless accompanied by visitors or relatives no freshman should<br />\noccupy a seat in the stands at<br />\nHomewood Field, other than in the<br />\nrooters' section.<br />\nFreshmen should be present<br />\nat all athletic contests at Homewood Field.<br />\n1. Freshmen should be present<br />\nat every student meeting, at which<br />\ntheir presence is deemed important<br />\nby the organization holding it.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, MAY 25, 1914.<br />\n12. The wearing of silk hats to<br />\nUniversity functions is the privilege of juniors and seniors only.<br />\n13. Freshmen should wear the<br />\n\"freshman button- always in the<br />\nlapel of the coat, in plain view.<br />\nWhile the University remains in<br />\nthe city, the term \"University property,\" in the seventh regulation, applies to that district bounded on the<br />\nnorth by Madison street, on the<br />\nsouth by Franklin street, on the<br />\neast by Howard street, and on the<br />\nwest by Eutaw street. It also applies to all Homewood property.<br />\nAs we think it unreasonable to<br />\nexpect the freshmen to wear a<br />\nspecial skull cap in the city, we substitute, in the thirteenth regulation,<br />\nsome form of button by which the<br />\nupper classmen can tell who are<br />\nfreshmen. The form of this button<br />\nmay be decided on by a committee.<br />\nThe caps can be substituted for the<br />\nbuttons when the University moves<br />\nto Homewood.<br /><br />\nHazing.<br />\nNo secret or disorganized hazing<br />\nshould be permitted to be indulged<br />\nin.<br />\nLet the third school day after the<br />\nsecond term begins be called Judgment Day. On this day at twothirty all freshmen are expected to<br />\nbe present in the Cage. They should<br />\nbe ready to do everything they<br />\nare ordered to do without complaint. A \"Judgment\" committee<br />\nof half the sophomore, one-third of<br />\nthe junior and twenty of the senior<br />\nclass be appointed by the class<br />\npresidents. This committee shall<br />\nmeet a sufficient number of times<br />\nto assign tasks for each individual<br />\nfreshman and to make complete arrangements for the affair. This<br />\ncommittee shall consider it their<br />\nduty to assign tasks to the individual<br />\naccording to his conduct, freshness,.<br />\nor meekness. In this way the fresh<br />\nfreshman will get his just deserts,<br />\nand the meek one who frequently<br />\ngets more than his share will be<br />\njustly treated. The Student Council should decide the limit of severity of the tasks. After this day<br />\nfreshmen will not be subjected to<br />\nfurther hazing.<br />\nA Board of Control should be instituted, composed mostly of freshmen, who may hear complaints<br />\nagainst the freshmen's deportment.<br />\nThey should have the power of using their own discretion in dealing<br />\nwith the offender, with a maximum<br />\npower of, say, reporting the offender to the Dean.<br />\nWe recommend that the sophomore class be not the only class to<br />\nenforce these regulations, but that<br />\nthe whole body of upper classmen<br />\nconsider it a duty to enforce them.<br />\nIt is all right that the sophomores<br />\nbe in the majority at the Judgment<br />\nDay performance, but the other<br />\nclasses should have a hand in the<br />\naffair also. Hazing and the enforcement of regulations by sophomores alone does the sophomores<br />\nmore harm than it does good to the<br />\nfreshmen.
