At that time, they also stated that the<br />\nnew vacancies would be filled by new<br />\nPh.D.'s who possessed \"bright, young<br />\nenergy.\" Of course, the Administration is<br />\nreally more interested in the \"bright,<br />\nsmall salaries\" that the younger professors<br />\nwill be getting, but that is par for the<br />\ncourse.<br />\nIt is disturbing to see this nation's<br />\nnarcissistic fixation with youth spreading<br />\ninto academia. The college campus is the<br />\none place where it should be obvious that<br />\nage and wisdom are often synonimous<br />\nand not, as the high-gloss media culture<br />\nwould have us believe, mutually exclusive.<br />\nThe federal law which pushes back<br />\nmandatory reitrement to age 70 is an<br />\novetdue admission that America's mentality with regard to its older citizens is<br />\nnot only morally indefensable, but<br />\ncontrary to simple common sense as well.<br />\nIt is to be deeply regretted that such a<br />\nfine remedial step contains a discriminatory loophole for exempting tenured<br />\nprofessors and only tenured professors<br />\nfrom enjoying the law's protection. In<br />\n<br />\nwhat other occupation is forced retirement less justified?<br />\nThe students have been reassured<br />\nthat the vacated positions will be filled by<br />\nup and coming young bucks, but is this<br />\nreally the case? Dean Suskind refuses to<br />\ntalk about the promised replacements,<br />\nsaying that it is wrong to discuss \"personalities\". (He must have learned that one<br />\nfrom Karl Block.) Also, since the beginning of the semester students have been<br />\nquietly learning that some young, associate professors will not be returning either.<br />\nThe usual reason given for their departure<br />\nis that they haven't published the required<br />\namount of scholarly articles. When the<br />\nvast amount of advising and paperwork<br />\nwhich the junior faculty are required to<br />\ndo is considered, however, then a paucity<br />\nof scholarship becomes nothing more than<br />\na convenient excuse.<br />\nWhat this all seems to boil down to<br />\nis that the faculty is going to be cut.<br />\nWhat is doubly aggravating is that the<br />\nAdministration feels obligated to go about<br />\nit in such a cloak-and-dagger manner.<br />\nWhy can't they level with the students<br />\nabout unpleasant realities?<br />\nPerhaps<br />\nthey've just forgotten how.<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editor<br />\n<br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\nPeter Choo<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nAnne McElwee<br />\n<br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nSigmund Nairn<br />\nPhilip Schutzer<br />\n<br />\nThe Real World<br />\n<br />\nProduction Staff<br />\nJeff Adelman<br />\nChris Hurley<br />\nDeborah Jones<br />\nP.J.

In 1946,<br />\nColeman founded Hopkins' Department of Writing, Speech and<br />\nDrama, now known as the<br />\nWriting Seminars, and he was its<br />\nlife's energy for 30 years.<br />\nColeman legitimatized the then<br />\nunprecedented and unique idea<br />\nof a degree granting academic<br />\nprogram for writers of fiction<br />\nand poetry.<br />\nOne of Coleman's students<br />\nwrites of him: \"Elliott's forbearance was saintly and his<br />\nkindness unfailing.<br />\nWithout<br />\nthem, I would have given up<br />\nwhat was an unrealistic aspiration early in the day and pursued my natural destiny to<br />\nbecome a railroad brakeman.\"<br />\nColumnist Russell Baker, however, was only one of many<br />\nstudents that Coleman inspired.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nDave Hawk's article on the<br />\nSGB's was excellent. As a BA<br />\nGeneralist myself, and having<br />\nput up with four years worth of<br />\naccusations of being a \"social<br />\nparasite\" (student) and avoiding<br />\nthe Real World, it has come as<br />\nquite a shock to discover that<br />\nthe Real World doesn't necessarily want us anyway. Dave: have<br />\nyou tried the Foreign Legion?<br />\nJ. Gunn Coolidge<br />\n<br />\nAs a student in the Writing<br />\nSeminars, John Barth was impressed with Coleman's dignity<br />\nand decorum combined with his<br />\npassionate love of literature.<br />\nBarth recalls: \"Coleman's example taught his students that<br />\none didn't have to be either a<br />\nbohemian or an adventurer in<br />\norder to write well.\"<br />\nAside from teaching poetry<br />\nand _fiction, Coleman also<br />\noffered courses on European modernists such as<br />\nJoyce, Pound, T. S. Eliot, Kafka,<br />\nand Proust. At the time of its<br />\nfoundation, the Writing, Speech,<br />\nand Drama department was the<br />\nonly program, after the Iowa<br />\nUniversity writer's workshop,<br />\ngiving an MA degree in writing.<br />\nAs Russell Baker reminds us, at a<br />\ntime when \"English literature<br />\nwas assumed at Hopkins to have<br />\nceased with Dante Gabriel Rossette,\" the Writing Seminars was<br />\nprobably the only place in the<br />\ncountry where the modernists<br />\nwere taught.

I have bought a<br />\ncar, and as a close neighbor of<br />\nthe University, I suddenly find<br />\nmyself on the other side of the<br />\nfence as far as the University/community parking situation<br />\nis concerned. While I was a<br />\nstudent and had no car, I could<br />\nnot have cared less what students, Athletic Center denizens<br />\nand dorm residents did with<br />\ntheir cars. Now, when I come<br />\nhome from work, the grocery<br />\nstore, etc., I find all the tenant<br />\n(free) parking spaces in front of<br />\nmy building occtipii,d, but When<br />\n<br />\n1 leave for work at 6:30 am,<br />\nthese cars are gone and my and<br />\nmy neighbors' vehicles sit alone<br />\nfar down the street<br />\nNaturally, this causes much<br />\nresentment on our part and<br />\ndoesn't help the University's<br />\nrelations with the community. I<br />\nfeel that the University should<br />\ncreate or allow more parking on<br />\ncampus and stress greater awareness and consideration on the<br />\npart of those who use the<br />\ncampus facilities and find it<br />\nnecessary to drive. This includes<br />\nusers and visitors to the gym,<br />\nevening college students (!),<br />\nvisiting parents and dorm residents who leave their cars on the<br />\nstreet for days at a time. For<br />\ninstance, gym users should be<br />\nurged to park behind the gym<br />\nand use the rear entrance,<br />\ninstead of parking on University<br />\nParkway. The current policy<br />\ndenying parking stickers to students who live within one-half<br />\nmile of the campus is ineffective<br />\n\u2014 these people drive anyway and<br />\npark on the streets.<br />\nIt is unfair to ask that<br />\nrent-payers (including other<br />\nHopkins students) and property<br />\nowners in the area around the<br />\nUniversity put up with this<br />\nfrustrating situation on a continuing, daily basis. I urge the<br />\nUniversity to put some thought<br />\ninto trying to better it, as one<br />\nalternative might be for the<br />\ncommunity to institute a resident-only<br />\nparking<br />\nsticker<br />\nsystem, similar to that in the<br />\nStadium area. This would be a<br />\nhardship for University drivers,<br />\nwho would then suffer ticketing<br />\nand towing, harsh measures<br />\nwhich could be prevented by<br />\nsome consideration.<br />\n<br />\nJonestown II<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nRev.

In<br />\nthose cases where one candidate<br />\nis winning by a majority of votes<br />\ncast for that office, Messana felt<br />\nthat in order to save time and<br />\nenhance the efficiency of the<br />\nelections process, the candidate<br />\nshould be declared the winner.<br />\nDefining 50% plus one as a<br />\ns majority, Messana motioned to<br />\nhave the Council vote on his<br />\nproposal.<br />\nIn discussing the issues, the<br />\nopposition centered around the<br />\nfact that 50% plus one is a<br />\nmarginal victory and, depending<br />\non voter turnout, the majority<br />\nmay sway in favor of a different<br />\ncandidate in the final election.<br />\nGeorge Connolly, Student Council President, pointed out that<br />\nvoter turnout at Hopkins, generally under 40%, tends to be<br />\nlower for the final election than<br />\nfor the primary because students<br />\n\"IIIIIIM1111111111111111111111111..<br />\n<br />\nlose interest as elections drag on. election, a write-in must have at<br />\nHe noted that the primary least 10% of the votes cast (for<br />\nobjective of the Elections Com- that office) to be placed on the<br />\nmission is to make sure that the final ballot.

But she really enjoyed her<br />\nwork, no matter how much she pretended to<br />\ncomplain.<br />\nThe telephone ring interrupted her<br />\nshower. Quickly, C.C. put on her satin robe<br />\nwhich barely covered her delicate thighs. C.C.<br />\npicked up the phone to hear her boyfriend's<br />\nvoice. \"Hey Carol,\" he said, \"how about<br />\ngoing to that new Italian restaurant, 'The Shoes<br />\nde Cementi' tomorrow night?\" \"Sounds great!\"<br />\nwas C.C.'s reply. They talked for a long time as<br />\nshe unconsciously caressed her cleavage, until<br />\nshe noticed something strange about her front<br />\nwindow. In her first story apartment it led right<br />\nto an alley, and it was open. C.C. normally<br />\nlocked that window. \"Look, I'll call you back<br />\nlater, Brad.\"<br />\nCautiously, she approached the window.<br />\nHad she left it open before she left for work?<br />\nOr had someone opened it? She looked outside.<br />\nNo one. C.C. quickly locked the window. Had<br />\nsomeone entered during the night, she wondered?<br />\nHer question was suddenly answered. Out<br />\nof the corner shadow, he jumped. He was<br />\n<br />\ndressed obscenely in a tuxedo and a Groucho<br />\nMarx mask, a cheap novelty disguise. He assaulted her with a cruel onslaught of puns<br />\nand one liners. She fought with all her might to<br />\nresist the attack but she realized that it was<br />\nuseless. His evil shone through his rubber glasses<br />\nwith eyebrows as he ravished her with such jokes<br />\nas: \"She's so fat that when she eats at McDonald's, you can see the 'Billions Served' sign<br />\nchange.\" \"My friend is so stupid that he sells<br />\nhair dryers to Hare Krishnas.\" \"My room is so<br />\nsmall that I have to go outside to change my<br />\nmind.\"<br />\nWhat was going through C.C.'s mind as<br />\nshe felt the hot, stale breath of her attacker?<br />\nWhat thoughts raced through her scourged brain<br />\nas he obscenely and rhythmically spat out his<br />\ndisgusting jokes? She knew she could resist no<br />\n<br />\n\"Of course I did!\"she cried, \"what kind<br />\nof girl do you think I am?\"<br />\n\"I'm sorry ma'am but we have to ask<br />\nthese questions for the record,\" was the officer's<br />\ncold reply. \"Now, who would you like us to get<br />\nin contact with?\"<br />\nC.C. thought for a moment. \"My parents,\" she replied. \"Mr. and Mrs. Christiansen of<br />\n1334 Stevenson Lane.\"<br />\n\"Anyone else?\"<br />\nC.C. answered. \"Yes, my boyfriend .\"<br />\nThe examining table was hard and uncomfortable. The young attending doctor entered<br />\nthe room.<br />\n\"Try to relax, miss,\" he said as he approached her. \"What I'm going to do is look for<br />\nlaugh marks and lines. It won' t hurt a bit.\"<br />\nC.C. had heard of such examinations. She<br />\n<br />\nFORCED LA<br />\nby Rob<br />\nA eAsE<br />\nFriedman<br />\n<br />\nAT-11 %IP<br />\n<br />\nlonger.

The New Wave<br />\ntries to remedy this by reviving and<br />\nfeeding upon past forms and styles in<br />\nnew contexts, but its contribution is<br />\na caricature--a cartoon resulting in an<br />\nimage of history as larger-than-life.<br />\nFrom their outdated costumes, hair-dos,<br />\nand dance gestures to their minimalist<br />\ndance tunes and the \"High Fidelty\"<br />\nsignature reminiscent of Sixties albums<br />\nthe B-52s exemplify this exaggeration.<br />\nThe New Wave dissects history and<br />\naffords itself an infinite number of<br />\npossibilities for reconstruction.<br />\nThe<br />\nmovement represents an act of patchwork. The Clash, a band which evolved<br />\nwith the New Wave but stands outside<br />\nof its mainstream, also confronts rock<br />\nand roll history, but not by rebuilding<br />\nthe past for the present.

During his four years as a<br />\nHopkins undergraduate, he serv.<br />\ned as senior class president,<br />\npresident<br />\nof the H-Club,<br />\nco-captain of the football team,<br />\ncaptain of the lacrosse team, and<br />\nwas a member of the Phi Gamma<br />\nDelta fraternity.<br />\nScott's active career in larosse began at Forest Park High<br />\nSchool where he played both<br />\ngoalie and midfield. In college<br />\nhis outstanding play as a midfielder earned him honorable<br />\n- mention All-American honors in<br />\n11. 1952 and a co-captain spot on<br />\nthe South All-Star team in the<br />\nNorth-South Lacrosse Classic.<br />\nHe also received the Penniman<br />\nCup as the best midfielder on<br />\nthe 1952 Hopkins team.<br />\nAfter graduating from Hopkins with a degree in history, Mr.<br />\nScott served in the U.S. Army as<br />\nan officer and training instructor<br />\nat the Army's elite Ranger<br />\nschool at Fort Benning, Georgia<br />\nfor two years.<br />\nDuring the<br />\nsummer of 1953, he was offered<br />\nthe job as head lacrosse coach at<br />\nHopkins by Marshall Turner,<br />\nwho was then the Blue Jay<br />\nAthletic Director.<br />\nDuring his twenty seasons as<br />\nlacrosse caoch, Mr. Scott led his<br />\n<br />\nteams to seven national championships. He was named Coach<br />\nof the Year in 1965, 1968, and<br />\n1972. Hero's Inc. also designated him College Coach of the<br />\nYear in 1970 and 1971. He was<br />\nnamed Director of Athletics in<br />\nthe spring of 1973 and retired<br />\nfrom coaching after the Blue<br />\nJays won the 1974 NCAA title.<br />\nRecently, Mr. Scott was<br />\ninterviewed by Roger Blumenthal of the News-Letter staff.<br />\n<br />\nand squash.

I want all<br />\nof our teams to be successful<br />\nin their level of competition and<br />\nto achieve conference championship play.<br />\nAs far as how the athletes<br />\ntravel and the quality of equipment that they use, we try to be<br />\nconsistent across the board.

We have<br />\nalso had All -Americans in fencing, cross-country, track, tennis.<br />\n<br />\nRobert Scott in his environment: Coaching.<br />\n<br />\nBrown, Hicks Hang Tough<br />\n<br />\nWrestlers Conclude 1980 Season<br />\n<br />\nLast weekend at Susquehanna College, it was the time<br />\nfor individual glory at the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference Division III Wrestling Championships. The wrestling team had<br />\njust turned in a good season, as<br />\nCoach Bill Anderson turned<br />\naround a shaky program with his<br />\ncoaching skills and the likes of<br />\nBrown, Doring, Cherry, Hicks,<br />\nTillis, Lu, Haladyna, Cassilly,<br />\nKanter, Berg, and Kennedy. The<br />\nteam achievement that had been<br />\nlacking throughout senior Russ<br />\nBrown's tenure at Hopkins was<br />\npresent this year, a fitting<br />\ngraduation present for the three<br />\nsenior tri-captains. But now was<br />\nthe time for personal satisfaction.<br />\nAt 150 lbs. Russ Brown<br />\ntook both his preliminary and<br />\nquarterfinal matches, and was<br />\nundefeated heading into the last<br />\nday of the tournaments. Brown<br />\ndefeated a Muhlenberg wrestler<br />\n7-1 to start his quest for a<br />\nmedal. He won again 12-7 over<br />\na Kings' College competitor to<br />\nadvance to the semifinals.<br />\nGoing into the tournament<br />\nRuss said he \"felt like shit.\"<br />\n\"I found it hard getting psyched<br />\nbecause I hadn't wrestled in the<br />\npast two weeks. I didn't think<br />\nI'd win anything.\"<br />\nOn the<br />\nwhole, his wrestling was good;<br />\nhe had the double leg trip<br />\nworking well, and he was able to<br />\nstand-up and control hands.<br />\nIn the semifinals Russ wrestled Anderson from Elisabethtown. Anderson had previously<br />\ndefeated Russ by a narrow 7-5<br />\n......<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\ndecision. Once again Brown lost<br />\na narrow decision. Anderson<br />\nwould go on to win the tournament, although Brown is almost<br />\nas good as Anderson.<br />\nBrown went on to take 6th<br />\nplace. In his final campaign he<br />\nhad a 9-1 dual-meet record. The<br />\nteam will miss him badly.<br />\nKyle Hicks was a highly<br />\nnews-worthy story in his own<br />\nright. Kyle took sixth place at<br />\n142 lbs. and in the process lost<br />\ntwo overtime matches that<br />\nwould have placed ,him way up<br />\ntop had he won. Kyle opened<br />\nthe tournwy with a preliminary<br />\nwin. He then proceeded to lose<br />\nin the quarterfinals by a referee's<br />\ndecision in overtime.<br />\nKyle<br />\noutwrestled the Kings' College<br />\nwrestler but the criterion for the<br />\nref's decision was a 15 second<br />\nriding time advantage the Kings'<br />\nwrestler had. Kyle got a forfeit<br />\non the first round of the consolations. He then won his next<br />\nmatch in that bracket. The<br />\nsingle leg shot was there when<br />\nKyle wanted it. In the semifinal's of the consolation bracket<br />\nKyle lost to Tony Harrison of<br />\nWidener, a wrestler Kyle had<br />\npreviously defeated by a point in<br />\nthe quadrangular meet. Harrison<br />\nescaped with 15 seconds left to<br />\nforce an overtime.<br />\nAs a team Hopkins scored<br />\n121<br />\n/<br />\n2 points, a significant improvement over last year's 11<br />\n/<br />\n2point performance.

At that time, they also stated that the<br />\nnew vacancies would be filled by new<br />\nPh.D.'s who possessed \"bright, young<br />\nenergy.\" Of course, the Administration is<br />\nreally more interested in the \"bright,<br />\nsmall salaries\" that the younger professors<br />\nwill be getting, but that is par for the<br />\ncourse.<br />\nIt is disturbing to see this nation's<br />\nnarcissistic fixation with youth spreading<br />\ninto academia. The college campus is the<br />\none place where it should be obvious that<br />\nage and wisdom are often synonimous<br />\nand not, as the high-gloss media culture<br />\nwould have us believe, mutually exclusive.<br />\nThe federal law which pushes back<br />\nmandatory reitrement to age 70 is an<br />\novetdue admission that America's mentality with regard to its older citizens is<br />\nnot only morally indefensable, but<br />\ncontrary to simple common sense as well.<br />\nIt is to be deeply regretted that such a<br />\nfine remedial step contains a discriminatory loophole for exempting tenured<br />\nprofessors and only tenured professors<br />\nfrom enjoying the law's protection. In<br /><br />\nwhat other occupation is forced retirement less justified?<br />\nThe students have been reassured<br />\nthat the vacated positions will be filled by<br />\nup and coming young bucks, but is this<br />\nreally the case? Dean Suskind refuses to<br />\ntalk about the promised replacements,<br />\nsaying that it is wrong to discuss \"personalities\". (He must have learned that one<br />\nfrom Karl Block.) Also, since the beginning of the semester students have been<br />\nquietly learning that some young, associate professors will not be returning either.<br />\nThe usual reason given for their departure<br />\nis that they haven't published the required<br />\namount of scholarly articles. When the<br />\nvast amount of advising and paperwork<br />\nwhich the junior faculty are required to<br />\ndo is considered, however, then a paucity<br />\nof scholarship becomes nothing more than<br />\na convenient excuse.<br />\nWhat this all seems to boil down to<br />\nis that the faculty is going to be cut.<br />\nWhat is doubly aggravating is that the<br />\nAdministration feels obligated to go about<br />\nit in such a cloak-and-dagger manner.<br />\nWhy can't they level with the students<br />\nabout unpleasant realities?<br />\nPerhaps<br />\nthey've just forgotten how.<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editor<br /><br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\nPeter Choo<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nAnne McElwee<br /><br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nSigmund Nairn<br />\nPhilip Schutzer<br /><br />\nThe Real World<br /><br />\nProduction Staff<br />\nJeff Adelman<br />\nChris Hurley<br />\nDeborah Jones<br />\nP.J.

In 1946,<br />\nColeman founded Hopkins' Department of Writing, Speech and<br />\nDrama, now known as the<br />\nWriting Seminars, and he was its<br />\nlife's energy for 30 years.<br />\nColeman legitimatized the then<br />\nunprecedented and unique idea<br />\nof a degree granting academic<br />\nprogram for writers of fiction<br />\nand poetry.<br />\nOne of Coleman's students<br />\nwrites of him: \"Elliott's forbearance was saintly and his<br />\nkindness unfailing.<br />\nWithout<br />\nthem, I would have given up<br />\nwhat was an unrealistic aspiration early in the day and pursued my natural destiny to<br />\nbecome a railroad brakeman.\"<br />\nColumnist Russell Baker, however, was only one of many<br />\nstudents that Coleman inspired.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nDave Hawk's article on the<br />\nSGB's was excellent. As a BA<br />\nGeneralist myself, and having<br />\nput up with four years worth of<br />\naccusations of being a \"social<br />\nparasite\" (student) and avoiding<br />\nthe Real World, it has come as<br />\nquite a shock to discover that<br />\nthe Real World doesn't necessarily want us anyway. Dave: have<br />\nyou tried the Foreign Legion?<br />\nJ. Gunn Coolidge<br /><br />\nAs a student in the Writing<br />\nSeminars, John Barth was impressed with Coleman's dignity<br />\nand decorum combined with his<br />\npassionate love of literature.<br />\nBarth recalls: \"Coleman's example taught his students that<br />\none didn't have to be either a<br />\nbohemian or an adventurer in<br />\norder to write well.\"<br />\nAside from teaching poetry<br />\nand _fiction, Coleman also<br />\noffered courses on European modernists such as<br />\nJoyce, Pound, T. S. Eliot, Kafka,<br />\nand Proust. At the time of its<br />\nfoundation, the Writing, Speech,<br />\nand Drama department was the<br />\nonly program, after the Iowa<br />\nUniversity writer's workshop,<br />\ngiving an MA degree in writing.<br />\nAs Russell Baker reminds us, at a<br />\ntime when \"English literature<br />\nwas assumed at Hopkins to have<br />\nceased with Dante Gabriel Rossette,\" the Writing Seminars was<br />\nprobably the only place in the<br />\ncountry where the modernists<br />\nwere taught. Fictionist Louis<br />\nRubin, a student in the departWI<br /><br />\n\u2022O<br /><br />\nNo Parking<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI know you must already be<br />\nvery aware of the lack of parking<br />\nspaces in the Homewood area,<br />\nbut maybe you can help raise<br />\nawareness within the University<br />\nas to how students, professors<br />\nand others drastically compound<br />\nthe problem.<br />\nHaving recently graduated, I<br />\nhave been kicked out into the<br />\ncold real world. I have bought a<br />\ncar, and as a close neighbor of<br />\nthe University, I suddenly find<br />\nmyself on the other side of the<br />\nfence as far as the University/community parking situation<br />\nis concerned. While I was a<br />\nstudent and had no car, I could<br />\nnot have cared less what students, Athletic Center denizens<br />\nand dorm residents did with<br />\ntheir cars. Now, when I come<br />\nhome from work, the grocery<br />\nstore, etc., I find all the tenant<br />\n(free) parking spaces in front of<br />\nmy building occtipii,d, but When<br /><br />\n1 leave for work at 6:30 am,<br />\nthese cars are gone and my and<br />\nmy neighbors' vehicles sit alone<br />\nfar down the street<br />\nNaturally, this causes much<br />\nresentment on our part and<br />\ndoesn't help the University's<br />\nrelations with the community. I<br />\nfeel that the University should<br />\ncreate or allow more parking on<br />\ncampus and stress greater awareness and consideration on the<br />\npart of those who use the<br />\ncampus facilities and find it<br />\nnecessary to drive. This includes<br />\nusers and visitors to the gym,<br />\nevening college students (!),<br />\nvisiting parents and dorm residents who leave their cars on the<br />\nstreet for days at a time. For<br />\ninstance, gym users should be<br />\nurged to park behind the gym<br />\nand use the rear entrance,<br />\ninstead of parking on University<br />\nParkway. The current policy<br />\ndenying parking stickers to students who live within one-half<br />\nmile of the campus is ineffective<br />\n\u2014 these people drive anyway and<br />\npark on the streets.<br />\nIt is unfair to ask that<br />\nrent-payers (including other<br />\nHopkins students) and property<br />\nowners in the area around the<br />\nUniversity put up with this<br />\nfrustrating situation on a continuing, daily basis. I urge the<br />\nUniversity to put some thought<br />\ninto trying to better it, as one<br />\nalternative might be for the<br />\ncommunity to institute a resident-only<br />\nparking<br />\nsticker<br />\nsystem, similar to that in the<br />\nStadium area. This would be a<br />\nhardship for University drivers,<br />\nwho would then suffer ticketing<br />\nand towing, harsh measures<br />\nwhich could be prevented by<br />\nsome consideration.<br /><br />\nJonestown II<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nRev.

Every nine minutes, a woman<br />\nbecomes a victim. Yes, we are talking about<br />\n\"forced laughter.\" This is a subject that can no<br />\nlonger be hidden under the laundry of fear<br />\nand the dirty shirts of ignorance. Forced<br />\nlaughter is here, it is real. To over fifty thousand women a year it is all too real.<br />\nOnly one out of five forced laughter cases<br />\never comes to court. But what is more tragic,<br />\nonly one out of ten laugh offenders ever receives<br />\nthe maximum punishment allowed by the law.<br />\nIn most cases, they are out on the streets in less<br />\nthan two years to harangue and heckle more<br />\nunsuspecting individuals.<br />\nWhat we are about to relate is an actual<br />\ncase study of one such individual. Her name<br />\ncannot be revealed to protect the persons<br />\ninvolved. We will call her by her true initials,<br />\nC.C. This is the story of one woman and the<br />\nhell she went through; the degradation of being<br />\nfcrced to laugh, and the even greater humiliation<br />\nof trying to obtain justice.<br />\nIt was dark and dreary on the night of<br />\nSeptember 20, 1979, as the rain poured down<br />\nlike so much phlegm. The clock showed 11:46 as<br />\nC.C. wearily entered her single apartment. The<br />\nend of another long day, she thought. Teaching<br />\nphotography at the School for the Blind was<br />\nno bowl of cherries. But she really enjoyed her<br />\nwork, no matter how much she pretended to<br />\ncomplain.<br />\nThe telephone ring interrupted her<br />\nshower. Quickly, C.C. put on her satin robe<br />\nwhich barely covered her delicate thighs. C.C.<br />\npicked up the phone to hear her boyfriend's<br />\nvoice. \"Hey Carol,\" he said, \"how about<br />\ngoing to that new Italian restaurant, 'The Shoes<br />\nde Cementi' tomorrow night?\" \"Sounds great!\"<br />\nwas C.C.'s reply. They talked for a long time as<br />\nshe unconsciously caressed her cleavage, until<br />\nshe noticed something strange about her front<br />\nwindow. In her first story apartment it led right<br />\nto an alley, and it was open. C.C. normally<br />\nlocked that window. \"Look, I'll call you back<br />\nlater, Brad.\"<br />\nCautiously, she approached the window.<br />\nHad she left it open before she left for work?<br />\nOr had someone opened it? She looked outside.<br />\nNo one. C.C. quickly locked the window. Had<br />\nsomeone entered during the night, she wondered?<br />\nHer question was suddenly answered. Out<br />\nof the corner shadow, he jumped. He was<br /><br />\ndressed obscenely in a tuxedo and a Groucho<br />\nMarx mask, a cheap novelty disguise. He assaulted her with a cruel onslaught of puns<br />\nand one liners. She fought with all her might to<br />\nresist the attack but she realized that it was<br />\nuseless. His evil shone through his rubber glasses<br />\nwith eyebrows as he ravished her with such jokes<br />\nas: \"She's so fat that when she eats at McDonald's, you can see the 'Billions Served' sign<br />\nchange.\" \"My friend is so stupid that he sells<br />\nhair dryers to Hare Krishnas.\" \"My room is so<br />\nsmall that I have to go outside to change my<br />\nmind.\"<br />\nWhat was going through C.C.'s mind as<br />\nshe felt the hot, stale breath of her attacker?<br />\nWhat thoughts raced through her scourged brain<br />\nas he obscenely and rhythmically spat out his<br />\ndisgusting jokes? She knew she could resist no<br /><br />\n\"Of course I did!\"she cried, \"what kind<br />\nof girl do you think I am?\"<br />\n\"I'm sorry ma'am but we have to ask<br />\nthese questions for the record,\" was the officer's<br />\ncold reply. \"Now, who would you like us to get<br />\nin contact with?\"<br />\nC.C. thought for a moment. \"My parents,\" she replied. \"Mr. and Mrs. Christiansen of<br />\n1334 Stevenson Lane.\"<br />\n\"Anyone else?\"<br />\nC.C. answered. \"Yes, my boyfriend .\"<br />\nThe examining table was hard and uncomfortable. The young attending doctor entered<br />\nthe room.<br />\n\"Try to relax, miss,\" he said as he approached her. \"What I'm going to do is look for<br />\nlaugh marks and lines. It won' t hurt a bit.\"<br />\nC.C. had heard of such examinations. She<br /><br />\nFORCED LA<br />\nby Rob<br />\nA eAsE<br />\nFriedman<br /><br />\nAT-11 %IP<br /><br />\nlonger. She just wanted him to leave her as soon never dreamed that one day she would receive<br />\nas possible. After each joke, he verbally jabbed one.<br />\n\"Now, open wide and spread your<br />\nher with a \"Get it? Ya get it?\" She knew what<br />\ncheeks.\"<br />\nhe wanted.<br />\nNumbness was all she was feeling. As she<br />\nAnd so she laughed.<br />\nAnd suddenly as he appeared, he was drank the bitter water, staring into space, the<br />\ngone. Seconds ticked away. Seconds that police officers and doctor convened.<br />\nseemed like a minute, or more. Maybe an hour.<br />\n\"No question about it officers,\" he<br />\nShe was alone. Guilt racked her mind.

Could he still<br />\nwould<br />\nC.C.<br />\nfront of the car.<br />\n\"I sometimes stay late to clean up. What love her? Would things ever be the same between<br />\ndoes that have to do with anything?\"she them? As soon as he saw her, without hesitation<br />\nhe ran to her and held her. For now, everything<br />\nscreamed.<br />\nwas all right.<br />\n\"Did you try to resist?\"<br />\n\"Well,\" the doctor said, as he turned to<br />\nleave. \"That's it.\"<br />\nThe younger officer smirked. \"Yeah Doc,<br />\nyour job is finished; but ours is just beginning.\"<br />\nThe days had passed slowly and painfully<br />\nfor C.C.; but now she had to face an even greater<br />\ndispleasure. Police commonly call it, \"the lineup.\"<br />\n\"Step up Number 1!\" the loudspeaker<br />\nblared. An elderly man with a fiddle stepped<br />\nforward and mentioned something about taking<br />\nhis wife.<br />\n\"No,\" C.C. said behind the two way<br />\nmirror. \"He was much younger..\"<br />\nNumber two was younger. \"White folk<br />\nare different from us black folk.

The seducer must remain cool<br />\nto the point of freezing in the wife's<br />\npresence, while the husband nearly carries<br />\nlove letters between the two. Just as the<br />\n\"zipless fuck\" advocated by Erica Jong is<br />\nthe ultimate sexual encounter, so the<br />\ncontactless courtship is the perfect<br />\nseduction.<br />\nSkeptics need not go off campus<br />\nto find further information or for proof<br />\nof this hypothesis, for Max Dixon is<br />\nperfectly willing to demoristrate the<br />\ntechnique right here. Dixon is currently<br />\nappearing at Theatre Hopkins in The<br />\nGood Doctor. This play is a collection of<br />\nshort stories by Anton Chekhov adapted<br />\nby Neil Simon. Mr. Dixon seduces his<br />\nfriend's wife (\"Please, no applause,\" he<br />\nsays) while the marvelously staged<br />\nproduction seduces the audience.<br />\nThe stories, which range from sad<br />\nto silly, are interspersed with narration by<br />\nDixon as Dr. Chekhov.

This new approach more accurately<br />\nreflects the film's tone and deemphasizes<br />\nthe one really violent scene. The Silent<br />\nPartner is, after all, more a personality<br />\nsketch than a police story.<br />\nThe first scene opens in a huge<br />\nshopping mall with shots of Santa Claus<br />\nfiling past crowds of holiday shoppers.<br />\nMeanwhile, at a bank in the mall, teller<br />\nMyles Cullen (Elliot Gould) discovers a<br />\ndeposit slip on which is written, \"I have<br />\nBY CATHY BATTAGLIA<br />\na gun.
