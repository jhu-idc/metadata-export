His resignation has been<br />\naccepted by the trustees. Dr. J.<br />\nWhitridge Williams, professor of<br />\nobstetrics, has already taken up Dr.<br />\nHowell's duties. The latter will,<br />\nhowever, retain the chair of physiology which he has held since<br />\n1894.<br />\nThe announcement of the resignation does not come as a surprise,<br />\nas the intimate friends of the dean<br />\nhave known for some time that he<br />\nwas seriously contemplating resigning. The combined duties of<br />\nthe two positions were felt by Dr.<br />\nHowell to be too exacting, and he<br />\ntendered his resignation in order<br />\nto have more time to devote to his<br />\nwork as professor of physiology.<br />\nPresident Remsen stated that he<br />\nwas sorry to lose Dr. Howell, but<br />\nthat he would continue on the staff.<br />\nDr. Howell is a Baltimorean by<br />\nbirth and received his preliminary<br />\neducation in the public schools of<br />\nBaltimore. He received his bachelor's and doctor's degrees from<br />\nHopkins, and in 1888 was appointed associate professor of<br />\nphysiology. In the early nineties<br />\nhe served on the staffs of the University of Michigan and Harvard<br />\nUniversity, but returned to Hopkins in 1894 to become professor<br />\nof physiology. In 1899 he was<br />\nmade dean.<br />\nDr. Williams is also a Hopkins alumnus and is president of<br />\nthe alumni association. He received his degree of doctor of<br />\nmedicine, however, from the University of Maryland. He has spent<br />\nseveral years abroad and since 1889<br />\nhas been collected with the medical<br />\nschool. Dr. Williams is an attractive lecturer and is noted for the<br />\namusing incidents and anecdotes<br />\nfrom his own personal experience<br />\nwhich lie intersperses in his explanations to his classes.<br />\n<br />\nAdditional opportunities for intercollegiate debating will be afforded Hopkins students by the inauguration this year of a triangular<br />\nleague between this University,<br />\nGettysburg College and Washington and Lee University.<br />\nLast year's victory at Lexington completed the series in which<br />\nHopkins and Washington and Lee<br />\nhad been engaged, and left both<br />\ninstitutions free to arrange new<br />\ncontests. Dr. French and the committee corresponded with a number<br />\nof colleges with a view to entering<br />\nsome kind of a triangular agreement. The expense of sending a<br />\nteam far from Baltimore prevented<br />\ncontests with some institutions,<br />\nwhile others were already engaged<br />\nin leagues among themselves.<br />\nIn the selection of Gettysburg<br />\nas one of the opponents, its intimate<br />\nrelations with Hopkins in the past<br />\nwere taken into account. With the<br />\nsingle exception of Yale, Gettysburg has sent more graduates to<br />\npursue advanced studies here than<br />\nhas any other college. Washington and Lee was taken on largely<br />\nbecause of the desire of the defeated Virginians for an opportunity for revenge.<br />\nOne difficulty in arranging the<br />\nterms of the agreement arose from<br />\nthe desire of the Washington and<br />\nLee authorities to put their law<br />\nstudents on the team. Both of the<br />\nother schools wished to limit the<br />\ncontest to undergraduates and objected to meeting the law men.<br />\nThe usual arrangements of triangular debates will govern the<br />\ncontests. Each institution will be<br />\nrepresented by two teams of three<br />\nmen each, one of which will debate<br />\nat home and the other abroad.<br />\nThus each college debates both of<br />\nthe others each year. The same<br />\nquestion is argued at all three institutions on the same night, and<br />\neach school upholds both sides, the<br />\naffirmative by one team and the<br />\nnegative by the other.<br />\nNew interest will doubtless be<br />\ntaken in intercollegiate debating<br />\nhere as a result of the new system.<br />\nSix places will be open to speakers<br />\ninstead of three as heretofore, and<br />\nthere must be twice as many alternates and advisers. This will demand the development of new debaters and will test the ability of<br />\nthe undergraduates on the platform. More candidates for the<br />\ndebating teams must apply in order<br />\nto turn out two winning teams.<br />\n<br />\nThe Dance.<br />\n<br />\nThe date of the second of the<br />\nseries of dances to be given by the<br />\nCotillion Club, which was announced for February 3rd, has been<br />\nchanged to Saturday, January 28th.<br />\nThe third dance will be given<br />\nSaturday, April 22nd. , It is hoped<br />\nthat as many men as possible will<br />\nmake a point of attending these<br />\ndances , and help to make them a<br />\nsuccess.<br />\n<br />\nThe last open date on the lacrosse schedule, Saturday, April 22,<br />\nhas now been filled. Manager<br />\nMakel has made arrangements with<br />\nthe Carlisle Indians for a game to<br />\nbe played at Homewood, and this<br />\ngame completes the schedule.<br />\nThe Indian game will come on the<br />\nSaturday before the Swarthmore<br />\ngame and it is in a way significant<br />\nthat the Indians are considered not<br />\ntoo strong to be played only 4. week<br />\nbefore the game which will in all<br />\nprobability decide the intercollegiate championship of the United<br />\nStates. Hopkins has games sched'tiled with three of the four teams<br />\nof the northern division of the<br />\nleague and victories over these<br />\nteams are practically certain to include a victory over the champions<br />\nof this division. This schedule<br />\nwith the northern team is rather<br />\nunusual for Hopkins. We play<br />\nHarvard regularly when their team<br />\ncomes south in the spring, but<br />\nCornell and Columbia have not<br />\nplayed in Baltimore for several<br />\nyears.<br />\n, There will be only one disappointment for lacrosse enthusiasts<br />\nin Baltimore this year\u2014the lack of<br />\na game between the 'Varsity and<br />\nMt. Washington. The Mt. Washington game always arouses great<br />\ninterest and many will be sorry<br />\nnot to have it this year.<br />\nThe schedule this year is very<br />\nearly, owing to the chancing of<br />\nthe league schedule. Heretofore<br />\nwe have played Swarthmore as the<br />\nlast game in the season, buf this<br />\nyear we are to play them first in<br />\nthe league games. This makes it<br />\nnecessary to have a strong preliminary schedule, starting about two<br />\nweeks earlier than usual.<br />\nOn the whole, the schedule is<br />\nmost satisfactory. There are two<br />\nmore games than usual, and all but .<br />\nthe Navy and Swarthmore are to<br />\nbe played at Homewood.<br />\nDr. James Mark Baldwin formerly professor of philosophy in<br />\nthis University is delivering the<br />\nopening series of lectures, in the<br />\nNew National Uhiversity of Mexico. He will presently publish a<br />\nnew book: \"The Individual. and<br />\nSociety.\"<br />\nDr. G.(to F. C. L.)\u2014What are<br />\nthe products of decomposition of,<br />\nNH 4, NO 3?<br />\nF. C.

The amount subscribed<br />\nbeing only $3o,000 which brings<br />\nthe total up to $168,000. There<br />\nwas only one large subscription,<br />\nthat of Mr. Henry Walters for<br />\n$15,000. But it is only apparently<br />\ntrue that the work on the fund has<br />\nbeen slightly retarded. When the<br />\nfirst half of the fund was completed<br />\nten days ago, the committee announced that it intended to raise<br />\nthe remaining million, or to be accurate '$900,000, outside of Baltimore. It considered that the citizens of Baltimore had responded<br />\ngenerously enough and that it<br />\nwould be unfair to ask them to<br />\nsubscribe the entire amount. Johns<br />\nHopkins is an institution national<br />\nin its scope and interests and it<br />\nis the nation that should help it in<br />\nits time of need. Consequently the<br />\ncommittee has been working elsewhere and the contribution of last<br />\nweek were the voluntary and unsolicited gifts of our noble citizens.<br />\nAs announced before Dr. E. R.<br />\nL. Gould has been at work in New<br />\nYork for some time \"prospecting.\"<br />\nHe has given out nothing definite<br />\nbut he has hinted at some rich gifts<br />\nwhich were promised toward the<br />\nsecond million. The committee<br />\nhas been working in other cities<br />\ntoo with more or less success. So<br />\nthe progress made during the last<br />\nten days which seems at first to<br />\nbe very little is in fact considerable.<br />\nA matter worthy of the highest<br />\npraise is the generosity and willingness with which the business men of<br />\nBaltimore have bent their energies<br />\nto the raising of the fund. Not<br />\nonly did they give freely of their<br />\nmeans but they organized into a<br />\ncommittee and gave much of their<br />\nvaluable time to the work of soliciting subscriptions from others. The<br />\nwomen are deserving of no less<br />\npraise; the work which was done<br />\nby the ladies' committee was admirable. If the results of the<br />\nactivities of these two committees<br />\nwere summated it would be found<br />\nthat, it constitutes a considerable<br />\npart of the total. \"It is doubtful,\"<br />\nsaid President Remsen, \"if there<br />\never was an instance in which the'<br />\ncitizens of any city showed so intense an -interest in, and so nobly<br />\nsupported, a \u2022 local educational institution.\"<br />\nThe general committee has<br />\nworked hard.

R. MIDDLETON AND H. H. YORK<br />\n(Continued front No. ix)<br />\n<br />\nThe next morning, Tuesday, May<br />\n17, about 8 o'clock, our train left<br />\nfor Kingston, and that was a ride<br />\nthat I do not think any of us will<br />\nsoon forget. In the coach in which<br />\nwe rode, there were no fewer than<br />\nnine nationalities of man represented, including Anglo-Saxon(English<br />\nand American), Japanese, Chinese,<br />\ncoolies from India, negroes, mulattoes, and half-breeds between the<br />\nChinaman and negro, between Japanese and coolies, and between the<br />\nEnglish and coolies. The coach<br />\nwas packed. There is an aisle up<br />\nthe middle of these coaches like<br />\nour American day-coaches, but instead of the seats all facing the<br />\nsame way, they are so arranged that<br />\nthe first and second seats, the third<br />\nand fourth seats face each other.<br />\nMost of the men were smoking<br />\ncigarettes and pipes, and not a few<br />\nof the women were enjoying them.<br />\nThis kept the car pretty Well filled<br />\nwith tobacco smoke in spite of the<br />\nfact that all the windows were open<br />\nand was made rather amusing by two<br />\nplacards tacked up overthe second<br />\npair of seats from each end on<br />\nopposite sides of the car, which<br />\nread,\"No smoking allowed in these<br />\nseats.\" The scats are wooden<br />\nbenches much like those seen along<br />\nthe walks in Druid Hill Park.<br />\nBefore going further, I. might<br />\nmention that all the train hands on<br />\nthe Jamaica Railway are negroes,<br />\neven to the mail clerks.<br />\nThe line of the railway, after<br />\nleaving Port Antonio, travels west<br />\nalong the seashore for quite a distance, then it crosses over the<br />\nmountains of the interior, by passes<br />\nand tunnels in a direction a little<br />\nwest of south, till it reaches Spanish Town, where the branch that<br />\ngoes to Montego Bay takes a northwesterly course and the main road<br />\nturns almost due east through the<br />\nlowlands to Kingston. The scenery<br />\nbetween Port Antonio and Spanish<br />\nTown simply beggars description;<br />\nIt is a succession of high mountains<br />\nand deep, narrow valleys, all covered with beautiful, living green. The<br />\n\u2022 fertile valleys, the more gentle<br />\nslopes, and the upland plateaus are<br />\nall covered with enormous banana<br />\nplantations. In making this trip,<br />\nsuddenly one's train comes around a<br />\n<br />\nbend out on to one of these enormous<br />\ntable-lands that is as lcvel as a table<br />\ntop and covered with banana palms.<br />\nRight in the middle of it, there juts<br />\nup into the air, to possibly one hundred feet, two great coral cliffs,<br />\ntheir perpendicular surfaces looking<br />\nlike enormous honey-combs.<br />\nThe Jamaican trains are not provided with dining cars, so, unless<br />\none carries his lunch, he is dependent for what he eats upon negro<br />\nwomen who are to be seen at almost every station along the railway with head baskets or wooden<br />\ntrays, full of fruit and other eatables. These eatables consist of<br />\npieces of very crude cane sugar,<br />\npeppermint candy, ginger bread,<br />\nwheat bread in various forms,<br />\nwhich, by the way, the natives esteem quite a luxury, owing to the<br />\nfact that the Jamaican import duty<br />\non flour stuffs is thirty-three and<br />\none-third per cent. ad valorem, and<br />\nfinally a sort of small meat pie, the<br />\nfilling of which seemed to be a sort<br />\nof curry. Most of us decided not<br />\nto avail ourselves of the opportunities of purchasing these delicacies.<br />\nThe fruit offered for sale consisted<br />\nlargely of mangoes. This fruit was<br />\nbrought into Jamaica from India<br />\nand the East. It is roughly, kidney<br />\nshaped, or pear-shaped, and its<br />\npulp, very stringy and of a decided<br />\n\"turpentine\" flavor, is of a golden<br />\nyellow color. Fully one-third of its<br />\nbulk is occupied by the single seed.<br />\nOne soon acquires a taste for this<br />\nfruit and enjoys eating it very<br />\nmuch. There are quite a number<br />\nof varieties of it grown on the<br />\nisland, the one esteemed the best,<br />\nbeing called \"Number Eleven.\" The<br />\n\"Number Eleven\" is said to get its<br />\nname from the fact that a ship<br />\ncarrying a consignment of seeds<br />\nwas wrecked on the island, and<br />\nwhen the case was opened it was<br />\nfound that the packages were numbered and did not have the names of<br />\nthe fruits on them. These seeds<br />\nwere planted and the one labeled<br />\n\"Number Eleven\" produced the<br />\nmangoes in question.<br />\nThe trip from Port Antonio to<br />\nKingston takes nearly a whole day,<br />\nso that we readied Kingston quite<br />\nlate in the afternoon, and were glad<br />\nto stretch our muscles once more,<br />\nand when we reached the Hotel<br />\nMyrtle Bank, I am sure that most<br />\nof us felt as though we had reached<br />\nthe conclusion of the first \"chapter\"<br />\nof our Jamaica experiences, and<br />\nthat we had thoroughly enjoyed it<br />\nfrom start to finish.<br />\n<br />\n63 Limited Trains Every Day<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT'S REPORT OUT<br />\n<br />\nFRESHMEN GYM.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br />\n<br />\nJanuary 6, 1911.<br />\nTo. the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014I noticed in your<br />\nlast issue an appeal to the undergraduate classes to organize in<br />\nmaking class contributions to the<br />\nHomewood Fund. I am writing<br />\nto tell you of the experience of the<br />\nlast two graduating classes which<br />\ntogether contributed a one-class<br />\nfund.<br />\nA committee was organized very<br />\nhastily to collect our fund and was<br />\nable to interview thirty-two men in<br />\nthe short time at its disposal. Of<br />\nthe thirty-two thus interviewed,<br />\ntwenty-six subscribed, one said that<br />\nhe would prefer making a substantial contribution later on, another<br />\nthat his parents had already contributed too large a sum for him to<br />\nbe able to add to it, and the rest<br />\nsorrowfully pleaded guilty to a<br />\ntemporary lack of funds. I should<br />\nlike to point out that,with avery few<br />\nexceptions,these subscriptions came<br />\nfrom men who were still students<br />\nand not, as our graduates have<br />\nsometimes been called, \"coiningmoney alumni.\" The average student was found to be able to contribute fifteen dollars in the course<br />\nof what is practically four years,<br />\nas is allowed under the terms of the<br />\nsubscription, and it would perhaps<br />\nbe advisable to call for this amount<br />\nfrom every student here. If this<br />\naverage were maintained among the<br />\nclasses, the students at the University would be recorded in the<br />\nfinal tabulation as contributing a<br />\nsum which is neither extortionate<br />\nnor unreasonable to expect. Besides this, please allow me to suggest, as very recently an undergraduate myself, that an organized response from undergraduate<br />\nclasses, no matter how insignificant<br />\nthe total might appear, would at<br />\nleast demonstrate that the younger<br />\nstudents are as much interested in<br />\nthe campaign as the oldest alumni<br />\nhave shown themselves to be.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nGEORGE ROSS VEAZEY, 'IO.<br />\nSenior Class Meeting.<br />\n<br />\nWins Historical Prize.<br />\n<br />\nThe American Historical Association, in its annual meeting held<br />\nrecently at Indianapolis, gave the<br />\nJustin Winsor prize to Edward<br />\nRaymond Turner, Ph.

It<br />\nhas been two years since the two<br />\nteams have played against each<br />\nother, the last match being won<br />\nby Pennsylvania. This last match<br />\nwas the first to be played under a<br />\nfour-year agreement under which<br />\nthe matches were to be played alternately at Baltimore and Philadelphia, the visitors paying traveling expenses and being entertained<br />\nby the hoine team. Last year no<br />\novertures were made by Pennsylvania and as the Chess Club at<br />\nHopkins was dormant the matter<br />\nwas allowed to lapse. This year<br />\nprobably a team of six men will go<br />\nto Philadelphia to play the match<br />\nthere. No date has been set but<br />\nit will be about the first of February.<br />\nAt a meeting of the executive<br />\ncommittee on Thursday last it was<br />\ndecided to assess each member<br />\nof the club twenty-five cents to pay<br />\nthe expenses of the trip in case that<br />\nthe treasury was low.

HOWELL RESIGNS AS DEAN<br /><br />\nTRIANGULAR DEBATE LEAGUE<br /><br />\nLACROSSE SCHEDULE COMPLETED<br /><br />\nGAINING SECOND WIND<br /><br />\nRetains Chair of Physiology, However,<br />\nand His Place is Taken by<br />\nProfessor Williams.<br /><br />\nHopkins, Gettysburg and Washington<br />\nand Lee to Meet in Platform Contests Under New Agreement.<br /><br />\nIndians Take Last Open Date, Assuring<br />\nUnusually Interesting Season.<br /><br />\nCommittee Renewing Efforts to Complete Second Million by a Vigorous<br />\nCampaign.<br /><br />\nAfter eleven years of service<br />\nDr. William Henry Howell has resigned as Dean of the Medical<br />\nSchool. His resignation has been<br />\naccepted by the trustees. Dr. J.<br />\nWhitridge Williams, professor of<br />\nobstetrics, has already taken up Dr.<br />\nHowell's duties. The latter will,<br />\nhowever, retain the chair of physiology which he has held since<br />\n1894.<br />\nThe announcement of the resignation does not come as a surprise,<br />\nas the intimate friends of the dean<br />\nhave known for some time that he<br />\nwas seriously contemplating resigning. The combined duties of<br />\nthe two positions were felt by Dr.<br />\nHowell to be too exacting, and he<br />\ntendered his resignation in order<br />\nto have more time to devote to his<br />\nwork as professor of physiology.<br />\nPresident Remsen stated that he<br />\nwas sorry to lose Dr. Howell, but<br />\nthat he would continue on the staff.<br />\nDr. Howell is a Baltimorean by<br />\nbirth and received his preliminary<br />\neducation in the public schools of<br />\nBaltimore. He received his bachelor's and doctor's degrees from<br />\nHopkins, and in 1888 was appointed associate professor of<br />\nphysiology. In the early nineties<br />\nhe served on the staffs of the University of Michigan and Harvard<br />\nUniversity, but returned to Hopkins in 1894 to become professor<br />\nof physiology. In 1899 he was<br />\nmade dean.<br />\nDr. Williams is also a Hopkins alumnus and is president of<br />\nthe alumni association. He received his degree of doctor of<br />\nmedicine, however, from the University of Maryland. He has spent<br />\nseveral years abroad and since 1889<br />\nhas been collected with the medical<br />\nschool. Dr. Williams is an attractive lecturer and is noted for the<br />\namusing incidents and anecdotes<br />\nfrom his own personal experience<br />\nwhich lie intersperses in his explanations to his classes.<br /><br />\nAdditional opportunities for intercollegiate debating will be afforded Hopkins students by the inauguration this year of a triangular<br />\nleague between this University,<br />\nGettysburg College and Washington and Lee University.<br />\nLast year's victory at Lexington completed the series in which<br />\nHopkins and Washington and Lee<br />\nhad been engaged, and left both<br />\ninstitutions free to arrange new<br />\ncontests. Dr. French and the committee corresponded with a number<br />\nof colleges with a view to entering<br />\nsome kind of a triangular agreement. The expense of sending a<br />\nteam far from Baltimore prevented<br />\ncontests with some institutions,<br />\nwhile others were already engaged<br />\nin leagues among themselves.<br />\nIn the selection of Gettysburg<br />\nas one of the opponents, its intimate<br />\nrelations with Hopkins in the past<br />\nwere taken into account. With the<br />\nsingle exception of Yale, Gettysburg has sent more graduates to<br />\npursue advanced studies here than<br />\nhas any other college. Washington and Lee was taken on largely<br />\nbecause of the desire of the defeated Virginians for an opportunity for revenge.<br />\nOne difficulty in arranging the<br />\nterms of the agreement arose from<br />\nthe desire of the Washington and<br />\nLee authorities to put their law<br />\nstudents on the team. Both of the<br />\nother schools wished to limit the<br />\ncontest to undergraduates and objected to meeting the law men.<br />\nThe usual arrangements of triangular debates will govern the<br />\ncontests. Each institution will be<br />\nrepresented by two teams of three<br />\nmen each, one of which will debate<br />\nat home and the other abroad.<br />\nThus each college debates both of<br />\nthe others each year. The same<br />\nquestion is argued at all three institutions on the same night, and<br />\neach school upholds both sides, the<br />\naffirmative by one team and the<br />\nnegative by the other.<br />\nNew interest will doubtless be<br />\ntaken in intercollegiate debating<br />\nhere as a result of the new system.<br />\nSix places will be open to speakers<br />\ninstead of three as heretofore, and<br />\nthere must be twice as many alternates and advisers. This will demand the development of new debaters and will test the ability of<br />\nthe undergraduates on the platform. More candidates for the<br />\ndebating teams must apply in order<br />\nto turn out two winning teams.<br /><br />\nThe Dance.<br /><br />\nThe date of the second of the<br />\nseries of dances to be given by the<br />\nCotillion Club, which was announced for February 3rd, has been<br />\nchanged to Saturday, January 28th.<br />\nThe third dance will be given<br />\nSaturday, April 22nd. , It is hoped<br />\nthat as many men as possible will<br />\nmake a point of attending these<br />\ndances , and help to make them a<br />\nsuccess.<br /><br />\nThe last open date on the lacrosse schedule, Saturday, April 22,<br />\nhas now been filled. Manager<br />\nMakel has made arrangements with<br />\nthe Carlisle Indians for a game to<br />\nbe played at Homewood, and this<br />\ngame completes the schedule.<br />\nThe Indian game will come on the<br />\nSaturday before the Swarthmore<br />\ngame and it is in a way significant<br />\nthat the Indians are considered not<br />\ntoo strong to be played only 4. week<br />\nbefore the game which will in all<br />\nprobability decide the intercollegiate championship of the United<br />\nStates. Hopkins has games sched'tiled with three of the four teams<br />\nof the northern division of the<br />\nleague and victories over these<br />\nteams are practically certain to include a victory over the champions<br />\nof this division. This schedule<br />\nwith the northern team is rather<br />\nunusual for Hopkins. We play<br />\nHarvard regularly when their team<br />\ncomes south in the spring, but<br />\nCornell and Columbia have not<br />\nplayed in Baltimore for several<br />\nyears.<br />\n, There will be only one disappointment for lacrosse enthusiasts<br />\nin Baltimore this year\u2014the lack of<br />\na game between the 'Varsity and<br />\nMt. Washington. The Mt. Washington game always arouses great<br />\ninterest and many will be sorry<br />\nnot to have it this year.<br />\nThe schedule this year is very<br />\nearly, owing to the chancing of<br />\nthe league schedule. Heretofore<br />\nwe have played Swarthmore as the<br />\nlast game in the season, buf this<br />\nyear we are to play them first in<br />\nthe league games. This makes it<br />\nnecessary to have a strong preliminary schedule, starting about two<br />\nweeks earlier than usual.<br />\nOn the whole, the schedule is<br />\nmost satisfactory. There are two<br />\nmore games than usual, and all but .<br />\nthe Navy and Swarthmore are to<br />\nbe played at Homewood.<br />\nDr. James Mark Baldwin formerly professor of philosophy in<br />\nthis University is delivering the<br />\nopening series of lectures, in the<br />\nNew National Uhiversity of Mexico. He will presently publish a<br />\nnew book: \"The Individual. and<br />\nSociety.\"<br />\nDr. G.(to F. C. L.)\u2014What are<br />\nthe products of decomposition of,<br />\nNH 4, NO 3?<br />\nF. C.

The amount subscribed<br />\nbeing only $3o,000 which brings<br />\nthe total up to $168,000. There<br />\nwas only one large subscription,<br />\nthat of Mr. Henry Walters for<br />\n$15,000. But it is only apparently<br />\ntrue that the work on the fund has<br />\nbeen slightly retarded. When the<br />\nfirst half of the fund was completed<br />\nten days ago, the committee announced that it intended to raise<br />\nthe remaining million, or to be accurate '$900,000, outside of Baltimore. It considered that the citizens of Baltimore had responded<br />\ngenerously enough and that it<br />\nwould be unfair to ask them to<br />\nsubscribe the entire amount. Johns<br />\nHopkins is an institution national<br />\nin its scope and interests and it<br />\nis the nation that should help it in<br />\nits time of need. Consequently the<br />\ncommittee has been working elsewhere and the contribution of last<br />\nweek were the voluntary and unsolicited gifts of our noble citizens.<br />\nAs announced before Dr. E. R.<br />\nL. Gould has been at work in New<br />\nYork for some time \"prospecting.\"<br />\nHe has given out nothing definite<br />\nbut he has hinted at some rich gifts<br />\nwhich were promised toward the<br />\nsecond million. The committee<br />\nhas been working in other cities<br />\ntoo with more or less success. So<br />\nthe progress made during the last<br />\nten days which seems at first to<br />\nbe very little is in fact considerable.<br />\nA matter worthy of the highest<br />\npraise is the generosity and willingness with which the business men of<br />\nBaltimore have bent their energies<br />\nto the raising of the fund. Not<br />\nonly did they give freely of their<br />\nmeans but they organized into a<br />\ncommittee and gave much of their<br />\nvaluable time to the work of soliciting subscriptions from others. The<br />\nwomen are deserving of no less<br />\npraise; the work which was done<br />\nby the ladies' committee was admirable. If the results of the<br />\nactivities of these two committees<br />\nwere summated it would be found<br />\nthat, it constitutes a considerable<br />\npart of the total. \"It is doubtful,\"<br />\nsaid President Remsen, \"if there<br />\never was an instance in which the'<br />\ncitizens of any city showed so intense an -interest in, and so nobly<br />\nsupported, a \u2022 local educational institution.\"<br />\nThe general committee has<br />\nworked hard.

In the coach in which<br />\nwe rode, there were no fewer than<br />\nnine nationalities of man represented, including Anglo-Saxon(English<br />\nand American), Japanese, Chinese,<br />\ncoolies from India, negroes, mulattoes, and half-breeds between the<br />\nChinaman and negro, between Japanese and coolies, and between the<br />\nEnglish and coolies. The coach<br />\nwas packed. There is an aisle up<br />\nthe middle of these coaches like<br />\nour American day-coaches, but instead of the seats all facing the<br />\nsame way, they are so arranged that<br />\nthe first and second seats, the third<br />\nand fourth seats face each other.<br />\nMost of the men were smoking<br />\ncigarettes and pipes, and not a few<br />\nof the women were enjoying them.<br />\nThis kept the car pretty Well filled<br />\nwith tobacco smoke in spite of the<br />\nfact that all the windows were open<br />\nand was made rather amusing by two<br />\nplacards tacked up overthe second<br />\npair of seats from each end on<br />\nopposite sides of the car, which<br />\nread,\"No smoking allowed in these<br />\nseats.\" The scats are wooden<br />\nbenches much like those seen along<br />\nthe walks in Druid Hill Park.<br />\nBefore going further, I. might<br />\nmention that all the train hands on<br />\nthe Jamaica Railway are negroes,<br />\neven to the mail clerks.<br />\nThe line of the railway, after<br />\nleaving Port Antonio, travels west<br />\nalong the seashore for quite a distance, then it crosses over the<br />\nmountains of the interior, by passes<br />\nand tunnels in a direction a little<br />\nwest of south, till it reaches Spanish Town, where the branch that<br />\ngoes to Montego Bay takes a northwesterly course and the main road<br />\nturns almost due east through the<br />\nlowlands to Kingston. The scenery<br />\nbetween Port Antonio and Spanish<br />\nTown simply beggars description;<br />\nIt is a succession of high mountains<br />\nand deep, narrow valleys, all covered with beautiful, living green. The<br />\n\u2022 fertile valleys, the more gentle<br />\nslopes, and the upland plateaus are<br />\nall covered with enormous banana<br />\nplantations. In making this trip,<br />\nsuddenly one's train comes around a<br /><br />\nbend out on to one of these enormous<br />\ntable-lands that is as lcvel as a table<br />\ntop and covered with banana palms.<br />\nRight in the middle of it, there juts<br />\nup into the air, to possibly one hundred feet, two great coral cliffs,<br />\ntheir perpendicular surfaces looking<br />\nlike enormous honey-combs.<br />\nThe Jamaican trains are not provided with dining cars, so, unless<br />\none carries his lunch, he is dependent for what he eats upon negro<br />\nwomen who are to be seen at almost every station along the railway with head baskets or wooden<br />\ntrays, full of fruit and other eatables. These eatables consist of<br />\npieces of very crude cane sugar,<br />\npeppermint candy, ginger bread,<br />\nwheat bread in various forms,<br />\nwhich, by the way, the natives esteem quite a luxury, owing to the<br />\nfact that the Jamaican import duty<br />\non flour stuffs is thirty-three and<br />\none-third per cent. ad valorem, and<br />\nfinally a sort of small meat pie, the<br />\nfilling of which seemed to be a sort<br />\nof curry. Most of us decided not<br />\nto avail ourselves of the opportunities of purchasing these delicacies.<br />\nThe fruit offered for sale consisted<br />\nlargely of mangoes. This fruit was<br />\nbrought into Jamaica from India<br />\nand the East. It is roughly, kidney<br />\nshaped, or pear-shaped, and its<br />\npulp, very stringy and of a decided<br />\n\"turpentine\" flavor, is of a golden<br />\nyellow color. Fully one-third of its<br />\nbulk is occupied by the single seed.<br />\nOne soon acquires a taste for this<br />\nfruit and enjoys eating it very<br />\nmuch. There are quite a number<br />\nof varieties of it grown on the<br />\nisland, the one esteemed the best,<br />\nbeing called \"Number Eleven.\" The<br />\n\"Number Eleven\" is said to get its<br />\nname from the fact that a ship<br />\ncarrying a consignment of seeds<br />\nwas wrecked on the island, and<br />\nwhen the case was opened it was<br />\nfound that the packages were numbered and did not have the names of<br />\nthe fruits on them. These seeds<br />\nwere planted and the one labeled<br />\n\"Number Eleven\" produced the<br />\nmangoes in question.<br />\nThe trip from Port Antonio to<br />\nKingston takes nearly a whole day,<br />\nso that we readied Kingston quite<br />\nlate in the afternoon, and were glad<br />\nto stretch our muscles once more,<br />\nand when we reached the Hotel<br />\nMyrtle Bank, I am sure that most<br />\nof us felt as though we had reached<br />\nthe conclusion of the first \"chapter\"<br />\nof our Jamaica experiences, and<br />\nthat we had thoroughly enjoyed it<br />\nfrom start to finish.<br /><br />\n63 Limited Trains Every Day<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT'S REPORT OUT<br /><br />\nFRESHMEN GYM.

The enrollment figures for the current year<br />\nhave already been made public in<br />\nthe Preliminary Register giving the<br />\nenrollment in the specific courses.<br />\nDuring the 34 years 6,530 students<br />\nhave been enrolled.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br /><br />\nJanuary 6, 1911.<br />\nTo. the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014I noticed in your<br />\nlast issue an appeal to the undergraduate classes to organize in<br />\nmaking class contributions to the<br />\nHomewood Fund. I am writing<br />\nto tell you of the experience of the<br />\nlast two graduating classes which<br />\ntogether contributed a one-class<br />\nfund.<br />\nA committee was organized very<br />\nhastily to collect our fund and was<br />\nable to interview thirty-two men in<br />\nthe short time at its disposal. Of<br />\nthe thirty-two thus interviewed,<br />\ntwenty-six subscribed, one said that<br />\nhe would prefer making a substantial contribution later on, another<br />\nthat his parents had already contributed too large a sum for him to<br />\nbe able to add to it, and the rest<br />\nsorrowfully pleaded guilty to a<br />\ntemporary lack of funds. I should<br />\nlike to point out that,with avery few<br />\nexceptions,these subscriptions came<br />\nfrom men who were still students<br />\nand not, as our graduates have<br />\nsometimes been called, \"coiningmoney alumni.\" The average student was found to be able to contribute fifteen dollars in the course<br />\nof what is practically four years,<br />\nas is allowed under the terms of the<br />\nsubscription, and it would perhaps<br />\nbe advisable to call for this amount<br />\nfrom every student here. If this<br />\naverage were maintained among the<br />\nclasses, the students at the University would be recorded in the<br />\nfinal tabulation as contributing a<br />\nsum which is neither extortionate<br />\nnor unreasonable to expect. Besides this, please allow me to suggest, as very recently an undergraduate myself, that an organized response from undergraduate<br />\nclasses, no matter how insignificant<br />\nthe total might appear, would at<br />\nleast demonstrate that the younger<br />\nstudents are as much interested in<br />\nthe campaign as the oldest alumni<br />\nhave shown themselves to be.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nGEORGE ROSS VEAZEY, 'IO.<br />\nSenior Class Meeting.<br /><br />\nWins Historical Prize.<br /><br />\nThe American Historical Association, in its annual meeting held<br />\nrecently at Indianapolis, gave the<br />\nJustin Winsor prize to Edward<br />\nRaymond Turner, Ph.

It<br />\nhas been two years since the two<br />\nteams have played against each<br />\nother, the last match being won<br />\nby Pennsylvania. This last match<br />\nwas the first to be played under a<br />\nfour-year agreement under which<br />\nthe matches were to be played alternately at Baltimore and Philadelphia, the visitors paying traveling expenses and being entertained<br />\nby the hoine team. Last year no<br />\novertures were made by Pennsylvania and as the Chess Club at<br />\nHopkins was dormant the matter<br />\nwas allowed to lapse. This year<br />\nprobably a team of six men will go<br />\nto Philadelphia to play the match<br />\nthere. No date has been set but<br />\nit will be about the first of February.<br />\nAt a meeting of the executive<br />\ncommittee on Thursday last it was<br />\ndecided to assess each member<br />\nof the club twenty-five cents to pay<br />\nthe expenses of the trip in case that<br />\nthe treasury was low. Mr. W. E.<br />\nPearce, Jr., was elected captain of<br />\nthe chess team.<br />\nThe prospects for a victory over<br />\nPennsylvania are not bright and<br />\nthe men would be highly elated if<br />\nthey got a draw.
