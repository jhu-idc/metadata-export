From several quarters come pronouncements on the evils of Gin, Jazz, and Co-Education.<br />\n\"Said Dr. Clarence Cook Little, the new president of the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan, in his inauguration speech:<br />\n\"'In the day of the highly explosive mixture of youth,<br />\ngasoline, and liquor borne swiftly on balloon tires to remote<br />\nretreats; in an era of college publications skating on the thinnest possible ice of decency, it would take Hercules himself to<br />\nguarantee a fair substitute, and I believe that the Augean stables were, in comparison, an early season practice.'<br />\n\"One of the many conclusions reached at the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nState Student Conference at Des Moines, Iowa:<br />\n\"The evils of petting and the double standard were shown.<br />\nDancing was discussed and the conclusion was reached that<br />\nmodern dancing is more detrimental than petting.'\"<br />\nWe reproduce these items for the lovers of \u2022the rich and<br />\njuicy in literature. We .refrain from calling the attention of<br />\nthe reader to the elegant diction, the remarkable choice of<br />\nwords, of the learned Little, of Michigan. We wish to call the<br />\n,attention of the campus at large to one fact only,\u2014kindly notice<br />\nthe section of the country which countenanced the moralistic<br />\nopinions of such intelligentsia. We wish to call attention to<br />\nthe virtues of the Maryland Free State. Here you find few<br />\nsuch opinions; here one can do as he pleases without having<br />\nto have the consent of the world at large.<br />\nHaving finished, we sit back with a sigh; and wait for the<br />\nprotests of loyal sons of the Middle West to roll in.<br />\n<br />\nDecember Review of Reviews. It is called \"College Football<br />\nToday.\"<br />\nIn the column and a half which the NEWS-LETTER so sensibly devoted to this news, it was declared that the article \"should<br />\nhave a great effect on public opinion.\" We do not know<br />\nwhether we agree with the letter of this statement, since we<br />\ndo not know just what it means: Hopkins journalese has a collegiate ambiguity to a remarkable degree. To our mind, however, it is true that \"College Football Today\" should have that<br />\ngreat effect. But we are just cynical enough to believe that<br />\nit won't.<br />\nAs the too timely NEWS-LETTER has already said, \"the arguments in it are forceful, the facts undeniable, . . . .\" It is,<br />\nindeed, an interesting and convincing answer to the usual<br />\nobjections to the sport. In other words, it is a sort of outline<br />\ndefense of football, written in simple and clear language. The<br />\nfact that it fails to discuss the most important question of<br />\nall,\u2014the relation of football to the essential nature of our<br />\neducational institutions,\u2014is doubtless due to lack of space.<br />\nThe excellence of the article lies in its presentation of the facts<br />\nsignificant to the game itself.<br />\nThe local write-up, however, failed to mention the thing<br />\nthat intrigued us most. It was the extremely deft juggling<br />\nof tenses in one of the paragraphs. Whoever taught Roger<br />\nShaw English Composition should find it a source of considerable pride.<br />\nWe print it here for the delectation, not to say enlightenment of the English Department:<br />\n\"Harvard has reached the lowest ebb in the history of<br />\nher football career this year. Yet her students continue to<br />\ncheer their team with undiminished vigor and enthusiasm,<br />\nand her alumni will have flocked from far and near to see<br />\n<br />\nthe annual classic<br />\n<br />\nwith Yale at Cambridge. These alumni<br />\ndid not expect to witness a Harvard victory,\u2014it would be<br />\na miracle. But they did expect to cheer the name of their<br />\nuniversity and all that name stands for, and wholeheartedly<br />\nto support a plucky team. They know that Harvard will<br />\nstill be Harvard, even amidst a series of crushing defeats.<br />\nTheir loyal spirit and high ideals of sportsmanship remain<br />\nunchanged.\"<br />\nThe italics are ours, of course.<br />\nBeing at present under the strain of replacing a comparatively expensive book which we lost recently, we are reminded<br />\nof the wrath of a friend whose copy of \"Beyond Good and<br />\nEvil\" disappeared last Spring from its parking place on the<br />\ncampus. He is now in full accord with the Geology Department on the subject of taking Nietzsche literally.<br />\n44<br />\n44<br />\n44<br />\nAt least one member of the Faculty is of the opinion that<br />\nthe recent Faculty Number of the Black and Blue Jay is reasonably mild and polite.<br />\nWhy is this?<br />\nIs our Faculty too good to be criticized? Is it too pale to<br />\nbe caricatured? too \"white\" to be railed at? too perfect to be<br />\nsatirized? Or is there danger in discussing it frankly?<br />\nThese are not rhetorical questions. We really want to<br />\nknow. Of course, we have a few- faint notions of our own.<br />\nAny interesting contributions on this subject will be printed<br />\n<br />\nOne more link in the chain of<br />\nevidence being forged by scientists of today in support of the<br />\ntheory of evolution was revealed<br />\nlast Thursday afternoon in a lecture by Dr. Frederick Orpen<br />\nBower, Regius Profesqor of Botany at the University of Glasgow.<br />\nHe talked on the \"Evidence of the<br />\nInheritance of Acquired Characters in the Evolution of Plants.\"<br />\nDr. Bower is a botanist of distinction. As an author, his scientific works have brought him a<br />\nwide reputation.<br />\n<br />\nSpecializes<br />\n<br />\nOn Fern<br />\n<br />\nIn the large range of his learning, he still took time to concentrate upon one species in the plant<br />\nworld. Out of the thousands of<br />\nplants that he has come across<br />\nin his chosen field of work, Dr.<br />\nBower selected the fern to study<br />\nin minute detail and, incidentally, to lecture upon.<br />\nThe greater part of his work<br />\ncentered around the gradual<br />\nchange through the ages in the<br />\nposition of the sporangia of the<br />\nfern. Sporangia are tiny seed-.<br />\ncases which grow in great numbers on the leaves of mature<br />\nplants and, eventually, when ripe,<br />\nbreak open their little boxes and<br />\nliberate the seeds in order to propagate the species.<br />\nDr. Bower found, in the study<br />\nof priinitive types of fern existing now only as fossils, that these<br />\nseed-boxes were at first attached<br />\nin an unprotected position to the<br />\nend or on the side of the leaves.<br />\nThis position experience showed<br />\nto be dangerous to the life of the<br />\nsporangia. There was danger<br />\nfrom too great exposure to direct<br />\nsunlight. There was the threat of<br />\ndeath by evaporation.<br />\nThe plant met the emergency.<br />\nGradually, in the steady progress<br />\nof centuries, a change took place.<br />\nDown in the vital cells of the fern<br />\nthere was a shifting, a slow alteration, almost imperceptible, but<br />\nvery real. The plant was adapting a part of itself to its environment; it was changing through<br />\nthe pressure of adverse conditions.<br />\nThe sporangia, in the course of<br />\ntrolls, was shifted from its former unsafe place to a sheltered<br />\nposition under the leaves.

From several quarters come pronouncements on the evils of Gin, Jazz, and Co-Education.<br />\n\"Said Dr. Clarence Cook Little, the new president of the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan, in his inauguration speech:<br />\n\"'In the day of the highly explosive mixture of youth,<br />\ngasoline, and liquor borne swiftly on balloon tires to remote<br />\nretreats; in an era of college publications skating on the thinnest possible ice of decency, it would take Hercules himself to<br />\nguarantee a fair substitute, and I believe that the Augean stables were, in comparison, an early season practice.'<br />\n\"One of the many conclusions reached at the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nState Student Conference at Des Moines, Iowa:<br />\n\"The evils of petting and the double standard were shown.<br />\nDancing was discussed and the conclusion was reached that<br />\nmodern dancing is more detrimental than petting.'\"<br />\nWe reproduce these items for the lovers of \u2022the rich and<br />\njuicy in literature. We .refrain from calling the attention of<br />\nthe reader to the elegant diction, the remarkable choice of<br />\nwords, of the learned Little, of Michigan. We wish to call the<br />\n,attention of the campus at large to one fact only,\u2014kindly notice<br />\nthe section of the country which countenanced the moralistic<br />\nopinions of such intelligentsia. We wish to call attention to<br />\nthe virtues of the Maryland Free State. Here you find few<br />\nsuch opinions; here one can do as he pleases without having<br />\nto have the consent of the world at large.<br />\nHaving finished, we sit back with a sigh; and wait for the<br />\nprotests of loyal sons of the Middle West to roll in.<br /><br />\nDecember Review of Reviews. It is called \"College Football<br />\nToday.\"<br />\nIn the column and a half which the NEWS-LETTER so sensibly devoted to this news, it was declared that the article \"should<br />\nhave a great effect on public opinion.\" We do not know<br />\nwhether we agree with the letter of this statement, since we<br />\ndo not know just what it means: Hopkins journalese has a collegiate ambiguity to a remarkable degree. To our mind, however, it is true that \"College Football Today\" should have that<br />\ngreat effect. But we are just cynical enough to believe that<br />\nit won't.<br />\nAs the too timely NEWS-LETTER has already said, \"the arguments in it are forceful, the facts undeniable, . . . .\" It is,<br />\nindeed, an interesting and convincing answer to the usual<br />\nobjections to the sport. In other words, it is a sort of outline<br />\ndefense of football, written in simple and clear language. The<br />\nfact that it fails to discuss the most important question of<br />\nall,\u2014the relation of football to the essential nature of our<br />\neducational institutions,\u2014is doubtless due to lack of space.<br />\nThe excellence of the article lies in its presentation of the facts<br />\nsignificant to the game itself.<br />\nThe local write-up, however, failed to mention the thing<br />\nthat intrigued us most. It was the extremely deft juggling<br />\nof tenses in one of the paragraphs. Whoever taught Roger<br />\nShaw English Composition should find it a source of considerable pride.<br />\nWe print it here for the delectation, not to say enlightenment of the English Department:<br />\n\"Harvard has reached the lowest ebb in the history of<br />\nher football career this year. Yet her students continue to<br />\ncheer their team with undiminished vigor and enthusiasm,<br />\nand her alumni will have flocked from far and near to see<br /><br />\nthe annual classic<br /><br />\nwith Yale at Cambridge. These alumni<br />\ndid not expect to witness a Harvard victory,\u2014it would be<br />\na miracle. But they did expect to cheer the name of their<br />\nuniversity and all that name stands for, and wholeheartedly<br />\nto support a plucky team. They know that Harvard will<br />\nstill be Harvard, even amidst a series of crushing defeats.<br />\nTheir loyal spirit and high ideals of sportsmanship remain<br />\nunchanged.\"<br />\nThe italics are ours, of course.<br />\nBeing at present under the strain of replacing a comparatively expensive book which we lost recently, we are reminded<br />\nof the wrath of a friend whose copy of \"Beyond Good and<br />\nEvil\" disappeared last Spring from its parking place on the<br />\ncampus. He is now in full accord with the Geology Department on the subject of taking Nietzsche literally.<br />\n44<br />\n44<br />\n44<br />\nAt least one member of the Faculty is of the opinion that<br />\nthe recent Faculty Number of the Black and Blue Jay is reasonably mild and polite.<br />\nWhy is this?<br />\nIs our Faculty too good to be criticized? Is it too pale to<br />\nbe caricatured? too \"white\" to be railed at? too perfect to be<br />\nsatirized? Or is there danger in discussing it frankly?<br />\nThese are not rhetorical questions. We really want to<br />\nknow. Of course, we have a few- faint notions of our own.<br />\nAny interesting contributions on this subject will be printed<br /><br />\nOne more link in the chain of<br />\nevidence being forged by scientists of today in support of the<br />\ntheory of evolution was revealed<br />\nlast Thursday afternoon in a lecture by Dr. Frederick Orpen<br />\nBower, Regius Profesqor of Botany at the University of Glasgow.<br />\nHe talked on the \"Evidence of the<br />\nInheritance of Acquired Characters in the Evolution of Plants.\"<br />\nDr. Bower is a botanist of distinction. As an author, his scientific works have brought him a<br />\nwide reputation.<br /><br />\nSpecializes<br /><br />\nOn Fern<br /><br />\nIn the large range of his learning, he still took time to concentrate upon one species in the plant<br />\nworld. Out of the thousands of<br />\nplants that he has come across<br />\nin his chosen field of work, Dr.<br />\nBower selected the fern to study<br />\nin minute detail and, incidentally, to lecture upon.<br />\nThe greater part of his work<br />\ncentered around the gradual<br />\nchange through the ages in the<br />\nposition of the sporangia of the<br />\nfern. Sporangia are tiny seed-.<br />\ncases which grow in great numbers on the leaves of mature<br />\nplants and, eventually, when ripe,<br />\nbreak open their little boxes and<br />\nliberate the seeds in order to propagate the species.<br />\nDr. Bower found, in the study<br />\nof priinitive types of fern existing now only as fossils, that these<br />\nseed-boxes were at first attached<br />\nin an unprotected position to the<br />\nend or on the side of the leaves.<br />\nThis position experience showed<br />\nto be dangerous to the life of the<br />\nsporangia. There was danger<br />\nfrom too great exposure to direct<br />\nsunlight. There was the threat of<br />\ndeath by evaporation.<br />\nThe plant met the emergency.<br />\nGradually, in the steady progress<br />\nof centuries, a change took place.<br />\nDown in the vital cells of the fern<br />\nthere was a shifting, a slow alteration, almost imperceptible, but<br />\nvery real. The plant was adapting a part of itself to its environment; it was changing through<br />\nthe pressure of adverse conditions.<br />\nThe sporangia, in the course of<br />\ntrolls, was shifted from its former unsafe place to a sheltered<br />\nposition under the leaves. There<br />\nthey are found today', with very<br />\nrare exceptions, on all ferns, protected effectively from sunlight<br />\nand evaporation.<br /><br />\npromptly.<br />\nTreatise Printed In England<br /><br />\nCONGRATULATIONS<br />\nWe take great pleasure in congratulating the new members<br />\nof Omicron Delta Kappa upon their election to that body.<br />\nThe mere fact that 0.

However,<br />\nthe job of keeping up to the level of the local circle is one<br />\nfraught with much danger, much hardship. There is danger<br />\nif the members relax in their work; there is hardship in<br />\nextending sufficient effort to keep high the honor of the society.<br />\nWe believe that the present members are fully capable of the<br />\ntask.<br />\nAgain, allow the NEWS-LETTER to extend its hearty congratulations to the new members a Omicroa Delta Kappa.<br /><br />\nALFRED NOYES IS GUEST OF<br />\nHONOR AT TUDOR-STUART TEA<br />\nAlfred Noyes, the distinguished<br />\nEnglish poet, was the guest of<br />\nhonor at a luncheon given by the<br />\nTudor and Stuart Club last Friday at 12:30 in the rooms of the<br />\nClub.<br />\nMr. Noyes was accompanied by<br />\nhis host, Captain Miles, Headmaster of Gilman Country School.<br />\nAbout thirty-five faculty and student members of the club attended<br />\nthe luncheon.<br />\nAfter the luncheon Mr. Noyes<br />\nrecited three of his poems.
