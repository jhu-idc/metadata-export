Maxson, U. S. A.,<br />\nwho had been captured three<br />\ntimes by the Germans, had escaped<br />\ntwice, but on his third capture<br />\nhad been retained for eight<br />\nmonths a prisoner in Camp Rastaat, Baden, spoke at the mass<br />\nmeeting on April 3.<br />\n\"The psychology of the Germans is hard to understand; he<br />\nis better to deal with when he is<br />\nlosing than when he is winning,\"<br />\nsaid the speaker. Captain Maxson<br />\nwas unfortunately a prisoner of<br />\nWar when Germany was winning.<br />\nIle said the German, when winning, was arrogant, proud, unbearable in his manner. The reverse was true when in 1918 the<br />\nfortunes of war turned and the<br />\nallied offensive began. The Germans probably foresaw the inevitable and tried to please Americans after the 15 of July. From<br />\nthat time on every courtesy was<br />\nshown to American prisoners.<br />\nCaptain Maxson told an interesting anecdote of the battle<br />\naround Amiens in which he was<br />\ncaptured, when the American<br />\narmy demonstrated for the first<br />\ntime its ability and bravery. His<br />\nsector had been retreating on a<br />\nfifty-mile front; they had fallen<br />\nback for a depth of thirty miles.<br />\nOn the third day the first-organized body of troops he had seen<br />\nfor days passed him, counterattacking against the vastly superior German strength. It was<br />\nCompany B and Company C of<br />\nthe Sixth American Engineers.<br />\nThose very boys were the ones<br />\nwho went into battle at the critical moment and saved Amiens,<br />\npivot point of allied communications.

They had<br />\nno way of communicating with<br />\nhome, they worked from sun-up<br />\nto \u2022 sun-down on a scant diet of<br />\nblack bread and acorn coffee, and<br />\non rare occasions some soup in<br />\nwhich horse meat was sometimes<br />\npresent.

As was made<br />\nknown sometime ago, so favorable<br />\na report was made concerning<br />\nthe work of the Hopkins R. 0.<br />\nT. C. unit by the District Inspector, that Col. F. J. Morrow, chairman of the Committee on Education and Special Training, of the<br />\nWar Department, expressed the<br />\ndesire to inspect the unit in<br />\nperson.<br />\nAccordingly, Col. Morrow was<br />\nthe inspecting officer Thursday.<br />\nafternoon. With him were Lt.Col. L. W. Redington, Lt.-Col. D.<br />\nF. E.'Casteel, Maj. 0. C. Drew<br />\nand Maj. R. B. Perry, secretary<br />\nof the committee. These officers<br />\nmade a thorough study of the<br />\nwork of the Hopkins unit, of the<br />\nequipment used in the various<br />\nclasses of Military Science, of the<br />\ncourses offered, and of the methods used in instruction.<br />\nAfter 'the battalion formation<br />\non the upper quadrangle, the men<br />\nwere marched by classes to their<br />\nlecture rooms. The seniors were<br />\nengaged in army paper-work the<br />\njunior and sophomore classes<br />\nwent to their engineering models<br />\nand the freshmen company gave<br />\nan exhibition drill. The time of<br />\nthe visitors was divided among<br />\nthese activities, all of which<br />\nseemed to arouse great interest.<br />\nThe whole unit, it may be said,<br />\nmade a very creditable showing.<br />\nIt is understood that the fact<br />\nalone of such a visit can be accepted with a great deal of satisfaction by those interested in the<br />\nsuccess of the Hopkins battalion.<br />\nA personal visit by the head of<br />\nthe committee in charge of the<br />\nreserve officers' training corps<br />\nunits reflects credit on the efforts<br />\nof Captain Guild, and on the<br />\nspirit of the members of the battalion.<br />\nAnnouncement was made last<br />\nweek by Captain Guild that the<br />\nservices of another officer had<br />\nbeen secured for the Hopkins<br />\nunit. James S.

The<br />\ngame was a battle from start to<br />\nfinish, and only the splendid<br />\nwork of the 'Varsity's close defense prevented the rain of shots<br />\nof the Alumni attack from counting. No credit should be taken<br />\nfrom the playing of the 'Varsity<br />\nattack, headed by Eggie Sutton<br />\nSilberstein, which<br />\nand Sam<br />\nshowed splendid team-work and<br />\nindividual ability for the opening<br />\ngame.<br />\nIt is generally said that the<br />\nAlumni are too old and shortwinded to stand the strain of the<br />\nsecond half. Such was not the<br />\ncase Saturday, for the veterans<br />\nplayed steadily all through the<br />\ngame, and scored their lone tally<br />\nin the last ten minutes of play,<br />\nfighting the 'Varsity to a standstill in the second period.<br />\nBefore the opening of the game<br />\na touch of solemnity was added<br />\nwhen \"Father Bill\" Schmeisser<br />\npresented to Captain Baxley, in<br />\nbehalf of the Alumni lacrosse<br />\nmen, a small silk memorial<br />\n*flag in honor of those former<br />\nlacrosse players who laid down<br />\ntheir lives in the war. The three<br />\nnames inscribed on the flag were<br />\nthose of Lieutenants W. Brown<br />\nBaxley, Warren M. Bunting and<br />\nTheodore Prince. As stated in<br />\nthe resolution offered with the<br />\npresentation, it is the purpose of<br />\nthe memorial to emphasize the<br />\nwonderful spirit of these men,<br />\nand to perpetuate the memory of<br />\ntheir sacrifice in the name of<br />\ntheir university and of their<br />\ncountry. The flag is to be pinned<br />\non the goal net during coming<br />\ncontests to remind the players<br />\nthat these men are always in the<br />\nfight, though not in body, and it<br />\nis to be presented to each successive captain at each annual<br />\nlacrosse banquet.<br />\nFirst blood was drawn by Captain Baxley after five minutes of<br />\nplay, following a beautiful pass<br />\nfrom \u201eSilberstein. The 'Varsity<br />\nagain came within scoring distance but failed, and for the next<br />\nfew minutes the ball was held at<br />\nthe \u2022'Varsity goal with Johnny<br />\nKnipp, Boyce and Armstrong<br />\ndriving in tihot after shot, all of<br />\nwhich Dougherty successfully<br />\nwarded off, ably assisted by the<br />\nbrilliant work of Morley at point.<br />\nThree more goals were scored<br />\nbefore the half ended, by Sutton,<br />\n<br />\nWords of farewell were exchanged between the Johns Hopkins student body and the retiring<br />\ndean, Dr. Brush, at a mass-meeting held on Thursday, April 3.<br />\nVertrees Wyckoff presided and introduced the speakers. Harris<br />\nKirk, as president of the Student<br />\nCouncil, made the presentation<br />\nand farewell speech to Dr. Brush.<br />\nHe gracefully pronounced the sincere feelings of the college in his<br />\nwords of tribute to Dr. Brush,<br />\ntouching on the appreciation for<br />\nhis kindness and services and the<br />\nregret at his departure. At the<br />\nclose of his remarks, he presented<br />\nDr. Brush with two gifts from the<br />\nundergraduates\u2014a leather portfolio, which he remarked might be<br />\nof some practical use, and a handsomely engraved scroll, a tribute<br />\nprepared by the Student Council.<br />\nDr. Brush, in reply, expressed<br />\nhis thanks for the gifts. A laugh<br />\ngreeted him when he spoke of a<br />\nformer gift from a Hopkins graduating class, which had taken the<br />\nform of a silver hairbrush. The<br />\nretiring dean told the students<br />\nthat they had co-operated well<br />\nwith the administration of the college, performing their task honorably, loyally and without prodding. He regretted that he was<br />\nleaving Hopkins for a new field<br />\nof work, but said that he liked his<br />\nnew \"job\" and he cordially invited the college to visit him at<br />\nTome.<br />\nBaxley and Williams, making the<br />\nscore 4 to 0 at the close of the<br />\nperiod.<br />\nThe second half brought out<br />\nbetter play on both sides, the ball<br />\nsee-sawing from one end of the<br />\nfield to the other with no score.<br />\nFinally, Bill Swartz, who substituted for Armstrong, managed to<br />\nslip one past Dougherty for the<br />\nsingle count of the older men.<br />\nSeveral times the Alumni threatened to score, but were unable.<br />\nHonors were about even in this<br />\nhalf, and the Alumni were unable<br />\nto make up the advantage which<br />\nthe 'Varsity gained in the first<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe 'Varsity team showed up<br />\nvery well, and special credit<br />\nshould be given to the defensive<br />\nwork of Morley and Dougherty.<br />\nSutton, Silberstein and Captain<br />\nBaxley look like a mighty \u2022good<br />\nscoring combination and should<br />\nmake a lot of trouble for opposing teams this year.<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col.

D. Thomas, chief<br />\nengineer of the Baltimore Dry<br />\nDocks and Shipbuilding Company.<br />\nThe size of the ships now being<br />\nbuilt for the trans-Atlantic trade,<br />\nMr. Thomas stated, is a matter<br />\nof wide discussion, as well as of<br />\ngreat disagreement. Full information must be given the builder<br />\nby the owners, regarding the uses<br />\nfor which the vessels are intended. Consideration must be<br />\ngiven to the types of cargohandling machinery, and likewise<br />\nto the running apparatus. The<br />\nboilers, engines, and their auxiliaries must be designed to meet<br />\noperating conditions. Where oil<br />\nis obtainable for fuel, water-tube<br />\nboilers are best for coal, Scotch<br />\nboilers are most widely used.<br />\nThe cost of building and operating ships depends upon the materials and speed of construction,<br />\nupon the fuel used in running,<br />\nthe wages of the crew, and the<br />\neconomy of operation and possibilities of reduction of the engineroom force. Large ships cost less<br />\nin proportion than smaller ones,<br />\nbut their size is limited by the<br />\nports and by weather conditions<br />\nat sea. In the future most of the<br />\nfreight ships will be over 1,800<br />\ntons dead weight capacity.<br />\nThe construction of one of the<br />\nnew fabricated steel ships was<br />\nnext outlined. After the specifications have been drawn up, and<br />\nthe contract has been given, the<br />\nmid-ship section and profile plans<br />\nare made, using data from previous ships. The distribution of<br />\nweights is effected by dividing<br />\nthe ship into \"weight groups.\"<br />\nThe lines are then designed. Detail plans are made in the drafting room in their logical order<br />\nas needed. A model is made from<br />\nthe lines determined, to a small<br />\nscale, and the plates are laid out<br />\non its surfaces. The task of laying out the full-size molds and<br />\n;templates is then accomplished in<br />\nthe mold loft, by a system of perpendicular offsets. It must be remembered that certain parts of<br />\nthe ships have many intricate<br />\nsystems of curvature, and much<br />\ncare must be taken if all of the<br />\nsections are to fit together neatly.<br />\nThe fabrication consists of preparing the members for assembly.<br />\nIdentification of all of the parts<br />\nis an important detail. The process of fabrication has advanced<br />\nso much in the last few years<br />\nthat now 80 per cent. of the material of the ship may be prepared<br />\naway from the ship, speeding up<br />\nthe work immeasurably.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

This<br />\nSpirit is noticeable for its absence rather than for its presence. Entering Hopkins from a<br />\nless well known college, I have<br />\nbeen greatly disappointed, not in<br />\nthe faculty or grade of scholarship, but in the lack of organization in the undergraduate body.<br />\nOne can scarcely realize that<br />\nthere is no time at which all the<br />\nclasses come together for an address by the president, dean, or<br />\nfaculty of the University. A<br />\ngeneral announcement cannot be<br />\nmade, nor can an important matter be urged except through_ a<br />\nspecially printed card, the MowsLETTER, or the use of the Open<br />\nForum on Thursday through the<br />\ncourtesy of the Y. M. C. A. cabinet. The greatest spirit, enthusiasm, and feeling of unity is<br />\nfound where get-together meetings are held, whether at the<br />\ntraining table, smokers in the<br />\ndorms, discussion groups, or in<br />\nthe fraternities. Such a meeting<br />\nin this University body would be<br />\nno exception.<br />\nThrough the chapel the majority of the colleges in this country<br />\nmeet this need. Such a meeting<br />\nOf students for a short time offers a chance for a talk by the<br />\nofficers of the University as well<br />\nas student announcements of all<br />\nactivities. The new athletic program can get its strength from<br />\nthis source, the Hopkins spirit its<br />\nlife.<br />\n0. W. U.<br />\n<br />\nsubscribe to the Hullabaloo is<br />\ntheir duty both to the University<br />\nand themselves that I am writing<br />\nthis letter.<br />\nIt should be emphasized that<br />\nthis year's Uullabaloo, as never<br />\nbefore, will represent every class<br />\nequally. Every student activity<br />\nfrom freshman to senior will receive equal attention. Furthermore this year's staff is no longer<br />\nhampered by war conditions, and<br />\nevery effort will be made to make<br />\nthis book a worthy memorial to<br />\nthe great work which Hopkins<br />\nhas done in the past war. That<br />\nthis effort will be a success is<br />\nundoubted. More and better material, more pictures and better<br />\ndrawings have been received than<br />\never before.

After<br />\nkeeping the class waiting for<br />\nabout an hour\u2014perhaps for the<br />\npurpose of putting all edge on the<br />\nappetites \u2014 the committee announced dinner.<br />\nMr. Williams, commonly known<br />\nas \"Tiff,\" was the toastmaster,<br />\nand his scintillating wit was<br />\nevinced in the veritable barrage<br />\nof stories which he \"got away<br />\nwith.\" He first introduced President Chisholm, who spoke about<br />\n\"The Class.\" A note of sadness<br />\nwas drawn into this speech when<br />\nPresident Chisholm remarked that<br />\nthis would probably be the last<br />\ntime the class would meet \"on<br />\ncommon ground.\" The gloom, however, speedily disappeared after<br />\nMr. Schmidt's opening sentence,<br />\nfor he refused \"to get off any serious stuff.\" He launched a witty<br />\ntirade against the academic men,<br />\nlarge numbers of whom seem to<br />\nhave gotten an average of ten or<br />\nclose to it. Mr. Schmidt attributes this to the fact that the academic courses are easier than<br />\nthose given in the Engineering Department.<br />\nAt this point, the toastmaster<br />\nannounced that President Goodnow, who was to have been the<br />\nguest of honor, was prevented<br />\nfrom attending the banquet by illhealth, and he had requested the<br />\ntoastmaster to convey his regrets<br />\nto the class. Mr. Harris Kirk<br />\nthen spoke on \"Reminiscences of<br />\nOur Freshman Banquet,\" and told<br />\nof the halcyon days when sophomores were served with the food<br />\nfor the amusement of the \"freshies.\" \"Tommy\" was scheduled to<br />\nspeak on \"The Hullabaloo,\" but<br />\nas he is the editor of that book,<br />\nand felt that he could not with<br />\ndelicacy give it its due measure<br />\nof praise, he told some side-splitting\u2014that's what he termed them<br />\n\u2014negro stories instead.

Captain Maxson<br />\nwas unfortunately a prisoner of<br />\nWar when Germany was winning.<br />\nIle said the German, when winning, was arrogant, proud, unbearable in his manner. The reverse was true when in 1918 the<br />\nfortunes of war turned and the<br />\nallied offensive began. The Germans probably foresaw the inevitable and tried to please Americans after the 15 of July. From<br />\nthat time on every courtesy was<br />\nshown to American prisoners.<br />\nCaptain Maxson told an interesting anecdote of the battle<br />\naround Amiens in which he was<br />\ncaptured, when the American<br />\narmy demonstrated for the first<br />\ntime its ability and bravery.

They had<br />\nno way of communicating with<br />\nhome, they worked from sun-up<br />\nto \u2022 sun-down on a scant diet of<br />\nblack bread and acorn coffee, and<br />\non rare occasions some soup in<br />\nwhich horse meat was sometimes<br />\npresent.

These officers<br />\nmade a thorough study of the<br />\nwork of the Hopkins unit, of the<br />\nequipment used in the various<br />\nclasses of Military Science, of the<br />\ncourses offered, and of the methods used in instruction.<br />\nAfter 'the battalion formation<br />\non the upper quadrangle, the men<br />\nwere marched by classes to their<br />\nlecture rooms.

The<br />\ngame was a battle from start to<br />\nfinish, and only the splendid<br />\nwork of the 'Varsity's close defense prevented the rain of shots<br />\nof the Alumni attack from counting. No credit should be taken<br />\nfrom the playing of the 'Varsity<br />\nattack, headed by Eggie Sutton<br />\nSilberstein, which<br />\nand Sam<br />\nshowed splendid team-work and<br />\nindividual ability for the opening<br />\ngame.<br />\nIt is generally said that the<br />\nAlumni are too old and shortwinded to stand the strain of the<br />\nsecond half. Such was not the<br />\ncase Saturday, for the veterans<br />\nplayed steadily all through the<br />\ngame, and scored their lone tally<br />\nin the last ten minutes of play,<br />\nfighting the 'Varsity to a standstill in the second period.<br />\nBefore the opening of the game<br />\na touch of solemnity was added<br />\nwhen \"Father Bill\" Schmeisser<br />\npresented to Captain Baxley, in<br />\nbehalf of the Alumni lacrosse<br />\nmen, a small silk memorial<br />\n*flag in honor of those former<br />\nlacrosse players who laid down<br />\ntheir lives in the war. The three<br />\nnames inscribed on the flag were<br />\nthose of Lieutenants W. Brown<br />\nBaxley, Warren M. Bunting and<br />\nTheodore Prince. As stated in<br />\nthe resolution offered with the<br />\npresentation, it is the purpose of<br />\nthe memorial to emphasize the<br />\nwonderful spirit of these men,<br />\nand to perpetuate the memory of<br />\ntheir sacrifice in the name of<br />\ntheir university and of their<br />\ncountry. The flag is to be pinned<br />\non the goal net during coming<br />\ncontests to remind the players<br />\nthat these men are always in the<br />\nfight, though not in body, and it<br />\nis to be presented to each successive captain at each annual<br />\nlacrosse banquet.<br />\nFirst blood was drawn by Captain Baxley after five minutes of<br />\nplay, following a beautiful pass<br />\nfrom \u201eSilberstein. The 'Varsity<br />\nagain came within scoring distance but failed, and for the next<br />\nfew minutes the ball was held at<br />\nthe \u2022'Varsity goal with Johnny<br />\nKnipp, Boyce and Armstrong<br />\ndriving in tihot after shot, all of<br />\nwhich Dougherty successfully<br />\nwarded off, ably assisted by the<br />\nbrilliant work of Morley at point.<br />\nThree more goals were scored<br />\nbefore the half ended, by Sutton,<br /><br />\nWords of farewell were exchanged between the Johns Hopkins student body and the retiring<br />\ndean, Dr. Brush, at a mass-meeting held on Thursday, April 3.<br />\nVertrees Wyckoff presided and introduced the speakers. Harris<br />\nKirk, as president of the Student<br />\nCouncil, made the presentation<br />\nand farewell speech to Dr. Brush.<br />\nHe gracefully pronounced the sincere feelings of the college in his<br />\nwords of tribute to Dr. Brush,<br />\ntouching on the appreciation for<br />\nhis kindness and services and the<br />\nregret at his departure. At the<br />\nclose of his remarks, he presented<br />\nDr. Brush with two gifts from the<br />\nundergraduates\u2014a leather portfolio, which he remarked might be<br />\nof some practical use, and a handsomely engraved scroll, a tribute<br />\nprepared by the Student Council.<br />\nDr. Brush, in reply, expressed<br />\nhis thanks for the gifts. A laugh<br />\ngreeted him when he spoke of a<br />\nformer gift from a Hopkins graduating class, which had taken the<br />\nform of a silver hairbrush. The<br />\nretiring dean told the students<br />\nthat they had co-operated well<br />\nwith the administration of the college, performing their task honorably, loyally and without prodding. He regretted that he was<br />\nleaving Hopkins for a new field<br />\nof work, but said that he liked his<br />\nnew \"job\" and he cordially invited the college to visit him at<br />\nTome.<br />\nBaxley and Williams, making the<br />\nscore 4 to 0 at the close of the<br />\nperiod.<br />\nThe second half brought out<br />\nbetter play on both sides, the ball<br />\nsee-sawing from one end of the<br />\nfield to the other with no score.<br />\nFinally, Bill Swartz, who substituted for Armstrong, managed to<br />\nslip one past Dougherty for the<br />\nsingle count of the older men.<br />\nSeveral times the Alumni threatened to score, but were unable.<br />\nHonors were about even in this<br />\nhalf, and the Alumni were unable<br />\nto make up the advantage which<br />\nthe 'Varsity gained in the first<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe 'Varsity team showed up<br />\nvery well, and special credit<br />\nshould be given to the defensive<br />\nwork of Morley and Dougherty.<br />\nSutton, Silberstein and Captain<br />\nBaxley look like a mighty \u2022good<br />\nscoring combination and should<br />\nmake a lot of trouble for opposing teams this year.<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col.

DEMUTH &amp; CO., New York<br />\nWorld's Largest Pipe Manufacturer<br /><br />\nTELLS OF SHIP CONSTRUCTION<br />\nAldred Lecturer Describes Modern Steel<br />\nFreight Ships Designed for TransAtlantic Trade\u2014Discussses Cost<br />\nof Building and Operating.<br /><br />\n\"The Modern Steel Freight<br />\nShip\" was the subject of the<br />\nAldred lecture of April 2 delivered by Mr. D. D. Thomas, chief<br />\nengineer of the Baltimore Dry<br />\nDocks and Shipbuilding Company.<br />\nThe size of the ships now being<br />\nbuilt for the trans-Atlantic trade,<br />\nMr. Thomas stated, is a matter<br />\nof wide discussion, as well as of<br />\ngreat disagreement. Full information must be given the builder<br />\nby the owners, regarding the uses<br />\nfor which the vessels are intended. Consideration must be<br />\ngiven to the types of cargohandling machinery, and likewise<br />\nto the running apparatus. The<br />\nboilers, engines, and their auxiliaries must be designed to meet<br />\noperating conditions. Where oil<br />\nis obtainable for fuel, water-tube<br />\nboilers are best for coal, Scotch<br />\nboilers are most widely used.<br />\nThe cost of building and operating ships depends upon the materials and speed of construction,<br />\nupon the fuel used in running,<br />\nthe wages of the crew, and the<br />\neconomy of operation and possibilities of reduction of the engineroom force. Large ships cost less<br />\nin proportion than smaller ones,<br />\nbut their size is limited by the<br />\nports and by weather conditions<br />\nat sea. In the future most of the<br />\nfreight ships will be over 1,800<br />\ntons dead weight capacity.<br />\nThe construction of one of the<br />\nnew fabricated steel ships was<br />\nnext outlined. After the specifications have been drawn up, and<br />\nthe contract has been given, the<br />\nmid-ship section and profile plans<br />\nare made, using data from previous ships. The distribution of<br />\nweights is effected by dividing<br />\nthe ship into \"weight groups.\"<br />\nThe lines are then designed. Detail plans are made in the drafting room in their logical order<br />\nas needed. A model is made from<br />\nthe lines determined, to a small<br />\nscale, and the plates are laid out<br />\non its surfaces. The task of laying out the full-size molds and<br />\n;templates is then accomplished in<br />\nthe mold loft, by a system of perpendicular offsets. It must be remembered that certain parts of<br />\nthe ships have many intricate<br />\nsystems of curvature, and much<br />\ncare must be taken if all of the<br />\nsections are to fit together neatly.<br />\nThe fabrication consists of preparing the members for assembly.<br />\nIdentification of all of the parts<br />\nis an important detail. The process of fabrication has advanced<br />\nso much in the last few years<br />\nthat now 80 per cent. of the material of the ship may be prepared<br />\naway from the ship, speeding up<br />\nthe work immeasurably.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

This<br />\nSpirit is noticeable for its absence rather than for its presence. Entering Hopkins from a<br />\nless well known college, I have<br />\nbeen greatly disappointed, not in<br />\nthe faculty or grade of scholarship, but in the lack of organization in the undergraduate body.<br />\nOne can scarcely realize that<br />\nthere is no time at which all the<br />\nclasses come together for an address by the president, dean, or<br />\nfaculty of the University. A<br />\ngeneral announcement cannot be<br />\nmade, nor can an important matter be urged except through_ a<br />\nspecially printed card, the MowsLETTER, or the use of the Open<br />\nForum on Thursday through the<br />\ncourtesy of the Y. M. C. A. cabinet. The greatest spirit, enthusiasm, and feeling of unity is<br />\nfound where get-together meetings are held, whether at the<br />\ntraining table, smokers in the<br />\ndorms, discussion groups, or in<br />\nthe fraternities. Such a meeting<br />\nin this University body would be<br />\nno exception.<br />\nThrough the chapel the majority of the colleges in this country<br />\nmeet this need. Such a meeting<br />\nOf students for a short time offers a chance for a talk by the<br />\nofficers of the University as well<br />\nas student announcements of all<br />\nactivities. The new athletic program can get its strength from<br />\nthis source, the Hopkins spirit its<br />\nlife.<br />\n0. W.

Every student activity<br />\nfrom freshman to senior will receive equal attention. Furthermore this year's staff is no longer<br />\nhampered by war conditions, and<br />\nevery effort will be made to make<br />\nthis book a worthy memorial to<br />\nthe great work which Hopkins<br />\nhas done in the past war. That<br />\nthis effort will be a success is<br />\nundoubted. More and better material, more pictures and better<br />\ndrawings have been received than<br />\never before. Even without further additions this year's Hullabaloo would be the best ever published, and with every additional<br />\ndollar more can be added to it.<br />\nIt is needless I think to point<br />\nout that, in addition to these<br />\nfacts, it is through the Hullabaloo<br />\nonly that we can obtain a perfect<br />\nand lasting record of the activities of our class during its freshman year.<br />\nA FRESHMAN.<br />\nBARN NOW HOUSES<br />\nMUCH-NEEDED TROPHY ROOM.<br /><br />\nPHI BETA KAPPAS TO BE<br />\nELECTED APRIL 15th.<br /><br />\nThe annual meeting of the PhiBeta Kappa Society will be held<br />\non Tuesday, April 15.

After<br />\nkeeping the class waiting for<br />\nabout an hour\u2014perhaps for the<br />\npurpose of putting all edge on the<br />\nappetites \u2014 the committee announced dinner.<br />\nMr. Williams, commonly known<br />\nas \"Tiff,\" was the toastmaster,<br />\nand his scintillating wit was<br />\nevinced in the veritable barrage<br />\nof stories which he \"got away<br />\nwith.\" He first introduced President Chisholm, who spoke about<br />\n\"The Class.\" A note of sadness<br />\nwas drawn into this speech when<br />\nPresident Chisholm remarked that<br />\nthis would probably be the last<br />\ntime the class would meet \"on<br />\ncommon ground.\" The gloom, however, speedily disappeared after<br />\nMr. Schmidt's opening sentence,<br />\nfor he refused \"to get off any serious stuff.\" He launched a witty<br />\ntirade against the academic men,<br />\nlarge numbers of whom seem to<br />\nhave gotten an average of ten or<br />\nclose to it. Mr. Schmidt attributes this to the fact that the academic courses are easier than<br />\nthose given in the Engineering Department.<br />\nAt this point, the toastmaster<br />\nannounced that President Goodnow, who was to have been the<br />\nguest of honor, was prevented<br />\nfrom attending the banquet by illhealth, and he had requested the<br />\ntoastmaster to convey his regrets<br />\nto the class. Mr. Harris Kirk<br />\nthen spoke on \"Reminiscences of<br />\nOur Freshman Banquet,\" and told<br />\nof the halcyon days when sophomores were served with the food<br />\nfor the amusement of the \"freshies.\" \"Tommy\" was scheduled to<br />\nspeak on \"The Hullabaloo,\" but<br />\nas he is the editor of that book,<br />\nand felt that he could not with<br />\ndelicacy give it its due measure<br />\nof praise, he told some side-splitting\u2014that's what he termed them<br />\n\u2014negro stories instead. But the<br />\nhit of the evening was made by<br />\nheavy John Stanley, who chanted<br />\na piece entitled \"Damn 9111Pir<br />\nEyes,\" which brought sponta<br />\n-1<br />\napplause from every member<br />\nthe class.<br />\nDr. Hulburt,the honorary president of the class, was suffering<br />\nfrom a very severe cold and could<br />\nnot be present.
