These included<br />\nJames Brown Scott, secretary of<br />\nthe Carnegie Peace Endowment,<br />\nof Washington, and Dr. Marcus<br />\nBenjamin, who is president of the<br />\nColumbia Alumni Club of that city.<br />\nThere were no set speeches, but<br />\nthe general trend of the extemporaneous remarks was congratulation to Baltimore that Hopkins had<br />\nbeen so fortunate as to obtain for<br />\nits head a man of the calibre and<br />\nlearning of Dr. Goodnow. From<br />\nPresident Butler came the note of<br />\nregret that Dr. Goodnow had decided to leave Columbia.<br />\nWhile most of the speeches were<br />\nby no means serious, President<br />\nGoodnow took occasion to touch<br />\nupon the big problem which confronts him as executive head of<br />\nsuch an institution as Hopkins. He<br />\ndeclared that ever since his arrival<br />\nhe had been asked what his policy<br />\nwould be with respect to the University.<br />\n\"It is. hard for me to make them<br />\nunderstand,\" he explained, \"that I<br />\nhave no policy yet; that before<br />\nmaking any plans for the future<br />\nwhich might affect the administration of the affairs of the University I will first have to study the<br />\nsituation with utmost care and find<br />\nout what is best to be done.\"<br />\nDr. William H.

Bricklayers, boiler<br />\nsetters and pipe fitters have gone.<br />\nIn their place there are a few<br />\nnegroes straightening up, and a<br />\nfew electricians connecting the dynamos and switchboards.<br />\nIn the boiler-room one finds all<br />\nfour boilers bricked in, and one<br />\nburning in order to heat the buildings which are now in use. It is<br />\none of the two equipped with the<br />\nRonney mechanical stokers, and the<br />\nease with which it may be attended<br />\nwould make old Mr. Sapp, who<br />\nfires the boilers in McCoy Hall,<br />\nquite envious. The other boiler,<br />\nequipped with the Ronney stoker,<br />\nis finished, as are also the two of<br />\nthe Taylor blast type. The stack<br />\nis now being put on the superheater, and when this is done the<br />\nboiler-room will be finished.<br />\nIn the pumproom adjoining,<br />\neverything is also practically completed, and the feed pumps are<br />\nworking.<br />\nThe three dynamos, two turbines<br />\nand one reciprocating engine, which<br />\ntogether comprise three units, are<br />\nall set up in the engine room, and<br />\nonly need a few connections before<br />\nthey begin generating current. The<br />\nswitch boards which control the<br />\nwhole of the new plant are also in<br />\nthis room, and are now being<br />\nwired. For the. present light is obtained from outside sources. The<br />\nengine room is directly over the<br />\npumproom.<br />\nIt is only in the northern part<br />\nof the power-house where the gas<br />\nand steam engine laboratories are<br />\nto be that the incomplete appearance remains. This is because<br />\nmuch of the machinery has not yet<br />\ncome, and because most of the<br />\ncontractor's efforts have been toward getting the boilers ready.<br />\nNow that this work has been<br />\nfinished, work on the laboratory<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nGLEE CLUB MAKES GREAT<br />\nSTRIDES WITH NEW MUSIC<br />\n<br />\nThe members of the .\\ I usical<br />\nClubs are hard at work. Under<br />\nthe direction of their respective<br />\nleaders, the Glee and Instrumental<br />\nsquads have been rehearsing diligently at frequent intervals and are<br />\nproducing results which promise<br />\nsomething really good at concerts<br />\nof the coming season. The Glee<br />\nClub has made remarkable strides.<br />\nIn one of the recent rehearsals an<br />\nentire song was worked through.<br />\nThe Instrumental men have some<br />\nrather difficult music to learn, and<br />\nin spite of the fact that they rehearse only once a week, have accomplished much. The music to<br />\nbe rendered this year by both clubs<br />\nhas been pronounced by those who<br />\nhave heard it the best that the clubs<br />\nhave ever had, and with the new<br />\nplans of handling the men, especially on the Glee Club, a wellrounded aggregation .of musicians<br />\nis expected to represent Johns Hopkins this year.<br />\nConcerts will be arranged in the<br />\nnear future, the first to take place<br />\nprobably about Christmas time. A<br />\nChristmas trip will not be taken this<br />\nyear, owing to the short time which<br />\nthe clubs have had for preparation,<br />\nand to the fact that it is very hard<br />\nto pay bills for a Christmas trip at<br />\nthe beginning of the season, when<br />\nthere is very little money in the<br />\ntreasury. The bad debts due to<br />\ntrips such as these are what the<br />\npresent management is trying to<br />\navoid altogether, in order to place<br />\nthe organization on a firm financial<br />\nbasis. Therefore, whatever trips<br />\nare made will be taken after there<br />\nhas been some money made through<br />\nchnrch concerts and other local engagements, Mills for some very<br />\nattractive trips are being considered<br />\nby the Board of Governors.<br />\n\u2022 Largest Chemical Laboratory.<br />\n<br />\nOn October 9 was dedicated the<br />\nnew chemical laboratory of the Universits? of Illinois, the largest building of its kind in the world.<br />\n<br />\nPlayed Creditable Defensive Came, But<br />\nAttack Was Disappointing\u2014Western<br />\nMaryland Won,6 to 0.<br />\nBy AN OLD PLAYER.<br />\n<br />\nThe fact that Coach Cates was<br />\nnot at Homewood to see the game<br />\nbetween Johns Hopkins and West<br />\nem Maryland will save the members of our team from the good<br />\nscolding which they deserve. Western Maryland won by a score of<br />\n6 to o. It would have been larger<br />\nhad not the 'Varsity played such<br />\na creditable defensive game.<br />\nBut it makes no difference how<br />\nstrong the defense is, a team is<br />\nworth very little or nothing if it<br />\nhas not developed a good attack.<br />\nHopkins has, or had, an attack that<br />\nwas excellent\u2014we need only to<br />\nlook to the Gettysburg and Washington College games to see this.<br />\nBut on Saturday the attack was<br />\nnot strong enough to make more<br />\nthan a couple of first downs. Why?<br />\nThe backfield men stopped whenever a tackle was imminent. Bob<br />\nHoffman was the only man who<br />\nmade his tacklers work. The<br />\nothers slowed down as soon as an<br />\narm was raised before them.<br />\nFurthermore, there was no interference worth mentioning. The<br />\nsquad has worked hard to develop<br />\nplays which specify a definite interference for the man with the<br />\nball. The plays work well in practice: there is always a man before<br />\nthe runner. But on Saturday, it<br />\nappeared that a lesson had never<br />\nbeen given in interference.<br />\nAnd what is more, I have never<br />\nseen a team so slow in signals, in<br />\npassing the ball and in getting off<br />\non a run. Every second must<br />\ncount; you know that: But a regular sermon in signals was read<br />\noff to the players. It took nearly<br />\nthree-quarters of.a minute to pass<br />\naround the numbers for the play,<br />\nand many times it was necessary to<br />\nhold a little consultation in which<br />\nthe numbers were explained. Why<br />\nshould this be? Doesn't every man<br />\nknow the signals? Captain Wilkinson was not wholly to blame for<br />\nthis condition. It took him a long<br />\ntime to call the signals, but it was<br />\napparently necessary, for the backfield (with the exception of Hoffman) did not readily grasp them.<br />\nThe defeat may be ascribed to<br />\nthe slowness of the backfield and<br />\nits lack of \"pep.\" I hope this will<br />\nnot be the case in the St. John's<br />\ngame. It would be better for the<br />\nmen to sit up all night and learn<br />\nthe signals than to have had sleep<br />\nand not know them in the most important game of the season.<br />\nBut the lack of attack was neutralized by the excellent offense.<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col, 2)<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 23, 1914.<br />\n<br />\nLaw School of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

The Annapolis team is<br />\nslightly the favorite, but Hopkins<br />\nis unwilling to concede that it will<br />\nhave a walk-away as St. John's<br />\nnow predicts.<br />\nThe team will come to Baltimore supported by the entire student body, and will have a band.<br />\nHopkins, too, will turn out in solid<br />\n\u2022 array, and will have its hired<br />\nmusicians, as is customary for this<br />\noccasion.

St. John's<br />\nhas won twelve games, and Hopkins nine. There were three ties,<br />\nand there were five years in which<br />\nthe teams did not meet.<br />\nSt. John's is a much older institution than Hopkins, and in the<br />\nearlier years had better facilities<br />\nfor putting strong teams on the<br />\nfield. It has not been many years<br />\nthat Hopkins has had Homewood<br />\nField, and many can remember<br />\nwhen the Black and Blue played<br />\nat Clifton Park to a non-paying attendance. In those days a hat was<br />\npassed around to cover expenses.<br />\nThe keen rivalry which now exists between the teams had its inception about 1906.

Among<br />\nthe pfomising candidates are Rowland, .the two Woodwards, Hoffman, Eiseman, W.

This is<br />\nlikely to be granted, and then the<br />\nswimmers will hold a meeting to<br />\nelect a captain and a manager and to<br />\ndiscuss plans for the season.

Nicholson is a record<br />\nholder for the breast stroke, while<br />\nEiseman is good in the dashes, having represented Doyle's Athletic<br />\nClub in several big meets. George<br />\nPenniman was interscholastic hundred-yard champion several years<br />\nago and, although out of practice,<br />\nwould undoubtedly prove a valuable<br />\nman for the relay team.<br />\nOf all the swimmers, however,<br />\nRowland is the best known in local<br />\ncircles. He sprang into prominence<br />\nby his work on Marston's team and<br />\nwon particu'ar fame by carrying off<br />\nboth the mo-yard and the 50-yard<br />\nin the City College-Freshman meet<br />\ntwo years ago. Since then he has<br />\nbeen improving rapidly. Although<br />\nprevented by illness from taking<br />\npart in the South Atlantics last<br />\nwinter, he competed often this summer, winning the Bar Harbor meet<br />\nfrom some of the best Eastern college swimmers and tying the 45yard pool record there in 23/5 seconds.

Some<br />\ntime ago Mr. Mirza predicted that<br />\nTurkey wou'd enter the European<br />\nwar as a German ally and at that<br />\ntime he said that Turkish participation would bring about a religious<br />\nstruggle of unprecedented limits.<br />\nIn accordance with his prophecy,<br />\nTurkey has been drawn into the<br />\nstruggle and Sheik-ul-Islam has declared a jehab, which is Persian for<br />\na holy war.<br />\nMr. Mirza has given his opinions<br />\nat some length in the feature article<br />\nof the current Outlook, and he reviewed his paper for a representative of THE NEWS-LETTER. He believes that the people in this country can scarcely calculate the power<br />\nthat the Mohammedan religion<br />\nholds over its members, or what<br />\nhatred is felt toward the Christians<br />\nin Persia, who are there called the<br />\ngiaours\u2014the unclean. In speaking<br />\nof the Mohammedan desire for a<br />\njehab, Mirza remarked, \"I have<br />\nheard the Mohammedans almost<br />\nsigh for a holy war; I am persuaded<br />\nthat they would not hesitate to come<br />\nback from Asia and Africa in answer to the cal of the sultan, and<br />\nif that unfortunate day ever dawns,<br />\nAllah help us.\"<br />\nIt is interesting to note how<br />\naccurately one of our fellow students has predicted events which<br />\nhave afterwards occurred.

The total enrollment to<br />\ndate is sixty-eight members, with<br />\nan average attendance of about<br />\nfifty. These figures are encouraging when the attendance of forme'<br />\nyears is considered, but when compared with the total enrollment of<br />\nstudents in the University, cause a<br />\ncertain disappointment. In consequence of this efforts are being<br />\nmade to increase these figures.<br />\nAttendance at chapel services has<br />\na!so been encouraging. For the<br />\nweek of November 2 the average<br />\nattendance was thirty-four. The<br />\nfollowing week this figure was<br />\ntwenty-nine and last week twentyseven. These averages show a<br />\nslight decrease.

Wood, professor of experimental physics, is a co-author of<br />\nthe story.<br />\nMr. Train, a grandson of George<br />\nFrancis Train, the well known New<br />\nEngland writer, is assistant district<br />\nattorney of New York, and is now<br />\nengaged in prosecuting in the Siegel case. He devotes much of his<br />\nleisure time, however, to the writing of fiction, and has won some<br />\ndegree of distinction in the magazine short-story field. He and Dr.<br />\nWood came to the conclusion last<br />\nsummer that a romance dealing<br />\nwith the present world war, and<br />\nintroducing many of the latest discoveries and theories of experimental physics, could not fail to be<br />\nof interest to a large number of<br />\nreaders. They accordingly set<br />\nabout writing \"The Man Who<br />\nRocked the Earth,\" and the immediate success of the story, as<br />\nevidenced by the general discussion<br />\nto which its publication has given<br />\nrise, proves that their surmise was<br />\ncorrect.<br />\nThe serial, like Jack London's<br />\n\"Iron Heel,\" and many of the novels of H. G. Wells, though it deals<br />\nwith future events, is written in<br />\nthe form of an historical narrative,<br />\nchronicling the occurrences of the<br />\neventful month of July, 1915. The<br />\nintroduction of new bombs, vortex<br />\nguns, and other novel instruments<br />\nfor the waging of advanced warfare, increase the interest of the<br />\n'reader in this original enterprising<br />\nand timely romance. The contribution of scientific data was of course<br />\nthe task of Dr. Wood, who also<br />\nwrote several of the passages dealing with more technical matters.<br />\nThe greater part of the work of<br />\nsheer narrative construction was<br />\nleft to Mr. Train.<br />\nThe story opens with a short account of the history of the war<br />\nup to July I, 1915. It then tells<br />\nhow Bill Hood, wireless operator<br />\nin the United States Observatory<br />\nat Washington, received a .mysterious message from a man who<br />\ndemanded that the war come to<br />\nan end, appointed the United States<br />\nGovernment as the agency which<br />\nshould assist him to carry his plans<br />\nto a successful conclusion, and<br />\nstated that, as a proof of his power<br />\nand authority to settle the question,<br />\nhe would increase the length of the<br />\nensuing stellar day, supposed to be<br />\na fixed and changeless quantity, by<br />\na period of five minutes.<br />\nThe actual accomplishment of<br />\nthis feat, and the many amazing<br />\noccurrences which ensued in breathless succession, are told graphically<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n23, 1914.<br />\n<br />\ninteresting story. Suffice it to remark here that the overwhelming<br />\nsweep of events that so signally<br />\nfailed to move the stolid and unemotional Bill Hood are more than<br />\nsufficient to fire the interest and<br />\nenthusiasm of the most casual and<br />\nindifferent reader, who will certainly prove unable to resist the<br />\nfascination of the humor, adventure<br />\nand mystery that make up \"The<br />\nMan Who Rocked the Earth.\"<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well\u2014fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nSMART CLOTHES<br />\nTO ORDER, $20 AND UPWARDS<br />\n<br />\nREADY-TO-WEAR CLOTHES<br />\n$15 AND UPWARDS<br />\n<br />\nPLAZA BUILDING<br />\n19 E.

May I, at<br />\nthe risk of repeating what the<br />\nformer writer on this matter said,<br />\nhave some space in order to describe conditions as they actually<br />\nexist?<br />\nEvery other student activity at<br />\nHopkins has ample means of support. The Musical Clubs charge<br />\nan admission to their concerts.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER and Hullabaloo<br />\n<br />\nhave subscriptions, and advertising<br />\nspace is sold. The Athletic Association gets fifty cents from everybody who sees the games at Homewood, holders of season tickets excepted, and in addition, it receives<br />\nten dollars from every undergraduate at the University.<br />\nIn the past the Debate Council<br />\nhas had but seventy dollars a year.<br />\nIt obtains fifty dollars from the<br />\nUniversity and five from each of<br />\nthe four classes. With this, it was<br />\nto pay for sending two men to<br />\nCharlottesville, two men to Chapel<br />\nHill, N. C., besides holding two<br />\ndebates in McCoy Hall with all the<br />\nconcomitant incidentals\u2014programs,<br />\npalms, tickets, postage, etc. The<br />\nresult is that there has always been<br />\na deficit which had to be made up<br />\nby the members of the teams and<br />\nothers desiring to uphold Hopkins'<br />\nreputation in debating.<br />\nThe Athletic Association has always managed to get along pretty<br />\nwell in the past, and yet its income was, this year, increased more<br />\nthan a thousand dollars by raising<br />\nthe undergraduate assessment from<br />\nfive dollars to ten.<br />\nThere are a great many students<br />\nwho never go into the gymnasium.<br />\nThere are some who work Saturdays and who can not go to the<br />\ngames, but they all pay their ten<br />\ndollars. Many of these take a<br />\ngreat interest in debating.

Bricklayers, boiler<br />\nsetters and pipe fitters have gone.<br />\nIn their place there are a few<br />\nnegroes straightening up, and a<br />\nfew electricians connecting the dynamos and switchboards.<br />\nIn the boiler-room one finds all<br />\nfour boilers bricked in, and one<br />\nburning in order to heat the buildings which are now in use. It is<br />\none of the two equipped with the<br />\nRonney mechanical stokers, and the<br />\nease with which it may be attended<br />\nwould make old Mr. Sapp, who<br />\nfires the boilers in McCoy Hall,<br />\nquite envious. The other boiler,<br />\nequipped with the Ronney stoker,<br />\nis finished, as are also the two of<br />\nthe Taylor blast type. The stack<br />\nis now being put on the superheater, and when this is done the<br />\nboiler-room will be finished.<br />\nIn the pumproom adjoining,<br />\neverything is also practically completed, and the feed pumps are<br />\nworking.<br />\nThe three dynamos, two turbines<br />\nand one reciprocating engine, which<br />\ntogether comprise three units, are<br />\nall set up in the engine room, and<br />\nonly need a few connections before<br />\nthey begin generating current. The<br />\nswitch boards which control the<br />\nwhole of the new plant are also in<br />\nthis room, and are now being<br />\nwired. For the. present light is obtained from outside sources. The<br />\nengine room is directly over the<br />\npumproom.<br />\nIt is only in the northern part<br />\nof the power-house where the gas<br />\nand steam engine laboratories are<br />\nto be that the incomplete appearance remains.

A<br />\nChristmas trip will not be taken this<br />\nyear, owing to the short time which<br />\nthe clubs have had for preparation,<br />\nand to the fact that it is very hard<br />\nto pay bills for a Christmas trip at<br />\nthe beginning of the season, when<br />\nthere is very little money in the<br />\ntreasury. The bad debts due to<br />\ntrips such as these are what the<br />\npresent management is trying to<br />\navoid altogether, in order to place<br />\nthe organization on a firm financial<br />\nbasis.

Western Maryland won by a score of<br />\n6 to o. It would have been larger<br />\nhad not the 'Varsity played such<br />\na creditable defensive game.<br />\nBut it makes no difference how<br />\nstrong the defense is, a team is<br />\nworth very little or nothing if it<br />\nhas not developed a good attack.<br />\nHopkins has, or had, an attack that<br />\nwas excellent\u2014we need only to<br />\nlook to the Gettysburg and Washington College games to see this.<br />\nBut on Saturday the attack was<br />\nnot strong enough to make more<br />\nthan a couple of first downs. Why?<br />\nThe backfield men stopped whenever a tackle was imminent. Bob<br />\nHoffman was the only man who<br />\nmade his tacklers work. The<br />\nothers slowed down as soon as an<br />\narm was raised before them.<br />\nFurthermore, there was no interference worth mentioning. The<br />\nsquad has worked hard to develop<br />\nplays which specify a definite interference for the man with the<br />\nball. The plays work well in practice: there is always a man before<br />\nthe runner. But on Saturday, it<br />\nappeared that a lesson had never<br />\nbeen given in interference.<br />\nAnd what is more, I have never<br />\nseen a team so slow in signals, in<br />\npassing the ball and in getting off<br />\non a run. Every second must<br />\ncount; you know that: But a regular sermon in signals was read<br />\noff to the players. It took nearly<br />\nthree-quarters of.a minute to pass<br />\naround the numbers for the play,<br />\nand many times it was necessary to<br />\nhold a little consultation in which<br />\nthe numbers were explained. Why<br />\nshould this be? Doesn't every man<br />\nknow the signals? Captain Wilkinson was not wholly to blame for<br />\nthis condition. It took him a long<br />\ntime to call the signals, but it was<br />\napparently necessary, for the backfield (with the exception of Hoffman) did not readily grasp them.<br />\nThe defeat may be ascribed to<br />\nthe slowness of the backfield and<br />\nits lack of \"pep.\" I hope this will<br />\nnot be the case in the St. John's<br />\ngame. It would be better for the<br />\nmen to sit up all night and learn<br />\nthe signals than to have had sleep<br />\nand not know them in the most important game of the season.<br />\nBut the lack of attack was neutralized by the excellent offense.<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col, 2)<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 23, 1914.<br /><br />\nLaw School of the<br /><br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Among<br />\nthe pfomising candidates are Rowland, .the two Woodwards, Hoffman, Eiseman, W.

This is<br />\nlikely to be granted, and then the<br />\nswimmers will hold a meeting to<br />\nelect a captain and a manager and to<br />\ndiscuss plans for the season.

Nicholson is a record<br />\nholder for the breast stroke, while<br />\nEiseman is good in the dashes, having represented Doyle's Athletic<br />\nClub in several big meets.

By the time of<br />\nElizabeth the township had become<br />\nmost important and its officers<br />\ngradually wrested control from the<br />\nlord or baron.

She told<br />\nof the new study, toneurology, the<br />\neffect of music upon the nervous<br />\nsystem of the individual and upon<br />\nthat of society generally. \"All the<br />\nmotions of the body are rhythmical,\" and music has a practical<br />\nplace in that it quiets the jarring<br />\nnerves and set up the rhythmic motions, which are so often disturbed<br />\nin daily life. \"Try to chew your<br />\nfood irregularly or walk unevenly<br />\nand you will soon find yourself becoming very nervous.\"<br />\nIt is her belief that music will so<br />\nquiet a mob that it will be entirely<br />\nincapable of violence.

Oftentimes the common people are the<br />\nmost musical. Beethoven, Mozart,<br />\nSchumann and others were of the<br />\ncommon people. However, Americans with talent, if poor, are unable to get the necessary training.<br />\nAll European countries make large<br />\n-appropriations for music and only<br />\nby such a method will Americans<br />\nbecome a musical race.<br />\nIn the second part of her lecturemusicale Dr. Powell sang a number<br />\nof selections illustrating the European types of music.<br />\nFootball\"Blow-Out\" Next Monday Night.<br /><br />\nPlans for the annual \"blow-out\"<br />\nto members of the football team<br />\nare now under way.

ENROLLS SIXTYEIGHT BIBLE CLASS STUDENTS<br /><br />\nThe Bible classes of the University Young Men's Christian Association are organized and meeting<br />\nregularly. The total enrollment to<br />\ndate is sixty-eight members, with<br />\nan average attendance of about<br />\nfifty. These figures are encouraging when the attendance of forme'<br />\nyears is considered, but when compared with the total enrollment of<br />\nstudents in the University, cause a<br />\ncertain disappointment. In consequence of this efforts are being<br />\nmade to increase these figures.<br />\nAttendance at chapel services has<br />\na!so been encouraging. For the<br />\nweek of November 2 the average<br />\nattendance was thirty-four. The<br />\nfollowing week this figure was<br />\ntwenty-nine and last week twentyseven. These averages show a<br />\nslight decrease. Secretary Sutton<br />\noffers a possible explanation of this<br />\nby the fact that with the approach<br />\nof cold weather most students are<br />\ninclined to consider at too great<br />\nlength the contrast between the<br />\ncold morning air and a warm bed.<br />\nDr. Fisk, who led the services<br />\nlast week, spoke on the \"Privilege<br />\nof Power,\" Those students who<br />\nattended these services found Dr.<br />\nFisk's talks very interesting and<br />\npractical.

Both classes will<br />\nmeet on Thursday night.<br /><br />\nWith Arthur Train Is Co-Author of a<br />\nNew War Serial in the Saturday Evening Post.<br /><br />\nThose who have been reading<br />\n\"The Man Who Rocked the Earth,\"<br />\na gripping war serial which is being published in the Saturday<br />\nEvening Post under the name of<br />\nArthur Train, will doubtless be<br />\ninterested to learn that Dr. Robert<br />\nW. Wood, professor of experimental physics, is a co-author of<br />\nthe story.<br />\nMr. Train, a grandson of George<br />\nFrancis Train, the well known New<br />\nEngland writer, is assistant district<br />\nattorney of New York, and is now<br />\nengaged in prosecuting in the Siegel case. He devotes much of his<br />\nleisure time, however, to the writing of fiction, and has won some<br />\ndegree of distinction in the magazine short-story field. He and Dr.<br />\nWood came to the conclusion last<br />\nsummer that a romance dealing<br />\nwith the present world war, and<br />\nintroducing many of the latest discoveries and theories of experimental physics, could not fail to be<br />\nof interest to a large number of<br />\nreaders. They accordingly set<br />\nabout writing \"The Man Who<br />\nRocked the Earth,\" and the immediate success of the story, as<br />\nevidenced by the general discussion<br />\nto which its publication has given<br />\nrise, proves that their surmise was<br />\ncorrect.<br />\nThe serial, like Jack London's<br />\n\"Iron Heel,\" and many of the novels of H. G. Wells, though it deals<br />\nwith future events, is written in<br />\nthe form of an historical narrative,<br />\nchronicling the occurrences of the<br />\neventful month of July, 1915. The<br />\nintroduction of new bombs, vortex<br />\nguns, and other novel instruments<br />\nfor the waging of advanced warfare, increase the interest of the<br />\n'reader in this original enterprising<br />\nand timely romance. The contribution of scientific data was of course<br />\nthe task of Dr. Wood, who also<br />\nwrote several of the passages dealing with more technical matters.<br />\nThe greater part of the work of<br />\nsheer narrative construction was<br />\nleft to Mr. Train.<br />\nThe story opens with a short account of the history of the war<br />\nup to July I, 1915. It then tells<br />\nhow Bill Hood, wireless operator<br />\nin the United States Observatory<br />\nat Washington, received a .mysterious message from a man who<br />\ndemanded that the war come to<br />\nan end, appointed the United States<br />\nGovernment as the agency which<br />\nshould assist him to carry his plans<br />\nto a successful conclusion, and<br />\nstated that, as a proof of his power<br />\nand authority to settle the question,<br />\nhe would increase the length of the<br />\nensuing stellar day, supposed to be<br />\na fixed and changeless quantity, by<br />\na period of five minutes.<br />\nThe actual accomplishment of<br />\nthis feat, and the many amazing<br />\noccurrences which ensued in breathless succession, are told graphically<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n23, 1914.<br /><br />\ninteresting story. Suffice it to remark here that the overwhelming<br />\nsweep of events that so signally<br />\nfailed to move the stolid and unemotional Bill Hood are more than<br />\nsufficient to fire the interest and<br />\nenthusiasm of the most casual and<br />\nindifferent reader, who will certainly prove unable to resist the<br />\nfascination of the humor, adventure<br />\nand mystery that make up \"The<br />\nMan Who Rocked the Earth.\"<br /><br />\nWYMAN<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well\u2014fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nSMART CLOTHES<br />\nTO ORDER, $20 AND UPWARDS<br /><br />\nREADY-TO-WEAR CLOTHES<br />\n$15 AND UPWARDS<br /><br />\nPLAZA BUILDING<br />\n19 E.

Baltimore Street<br /><br />\nThe Debating Teams' Finances.<br />\nNOVEMBER 19, 1914.<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nEditor<br />\nTo the<br /><br />\nSIR\u2014Some time ago there appeared in this column a letter deploring the sad state of the finances<br />\nof the Debate Council. May I, at<br />\nthe risk of repeating what the<br />\nformer writer on this matter said,<br />\nhave some space in order to describe conditions as they actually<br />\nexist?<br />\nEvery other student activity at<br />\nHopkins has ample means of support. The Musical Clubs charge<br />\nan admission to their concerts.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER and Hullabaloo<br /><br />\nhave subscriptions, and advertising<br />\nspace is sold. The Athletic Association gets fifty cents from everybody who sees the games at Homewood, holders of season tickets excepted, and in addition, it receives<br />\nten dollars from every undergraduate at the University.<br />\nIn the past the Debate Council<br />\nhas had but seventy dollars a year.<br />\nIt obtains fifty dollars from the<br />\nUniversity and five from each of<br />\nthe four classes. With this, it was<br />\nto pay for sending two men to<br />\nCharlottesville, two men to Chapel<br />\nHill, N. C., besides holding two<br />\ndebates in McCoy Hall with all the<br />\nconcomitant incidentals\u2014programs,<br />\npalms, tickets, postage, etc. The<br />\nresult is that there has always been<br />\na deficit which had to be made up<br />\nby the members of the teams and<br />\nothers desiring to uphold Hopkins'<br />\nreputation in debating.<br />\nThe Athletic Association has always managed to get along pretty<br />\nwell in the past, and yet its income was, this year, increased more<br />\nthan a thousand dollars by raising<br />\nthe undergraduate assessment from<br />\nfive dollars to ten.<br />\nThere are a great many students<br />\nwho never go into the gymnasium.<br />\nThere are some who work Saturdays and who can not go to the<br />\ngames, but they all pay their ten<br />\ndollars. Many of these take a<br />\ngreat interest in debating. Wouldn't<br />\nit be but fair if the Athletic Association would contribute something<br />\nto the support of that in which<br />\nthese men are interested?<br />\nRespectfully,<br /><br />\nMILLARD EISEMAN.<br /><br />\n9<br />\nTheatrical Measurements for Stranded<br />\nActors.<br /><br />\nPhiladelphia to New York-135,471 railroad ties.<br />\nNew York to Chicago-2,251,947<br />\nties.<br />\nChicago to St. Louis-3,055,32I<br />\nties.<br />\nNew York to San Francisco5,978,156 ties.\u2014Pennsylvania Punch<br />\nBowl.<br />\n\"What do you charge for your<br />\nrooms?\"<br />\n\"Five dollars up.\"<br />\n\"But I'm a student\u2014\"<br />\n\"Then it's five dollars down.\"\u2014<br />\nCornell Widow.<br />\n\"How do you feel this morning?\"<br />\nasked Barnwell, meeting a wellknown Kentucky colonel.<br />\n\"Rotten, sah.
