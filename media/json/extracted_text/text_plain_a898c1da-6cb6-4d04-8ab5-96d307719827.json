Fieldson conceded<br />\nthat while Hopkins is not immune<br />\n,to these problems, he cited<br />\nRichardson's commitment to<br />\ngraduate students and his willingness to address graduate concerns. \"One of Hopkins' best<br />\nstrengtM is William Richardson,\" he said.<br />\nPhilip Hale, president of the<br />\nPeabody Students Association,<br />\nfor<br />\nRichardson<br />\nthanked<br />\n\"his commitment to the Peabody<br />\nConservatory, his fund-raising,<br />\nand creating a positive working<br />\nexperience.\" In addition, Hale<br />\npresented an autographed portrait<br />\nof concert pianist Arthur Rubenstein to Richardson.<br />\n<br />\nRepresenting the undergraduate body, President<br />\nBob Nelson of the Student Council was particularly impressed<br />\nwith Richardson's efforts to actively meet students, including<br />\nthe invitation of Orientation<br />\nleaders to his home for dinner and<br />\nhis attendance at Hopkins basketball games. Speaking about the<br />\nchanges that should be made in<br />\nthe future, Nelson said, \"I hope<br />\nthat the undergraduate students<br />\nhave more input on school affairs, anything from modifications of the curriculum, the Student Union, campus housing, and<br />\ngraduation requirements.\"<br />\nTwo other problems mentioned by Nelson were the expanded enrollment and the<br />\ndecrease of the faculty, as well as<br />\nsecurity on campus in terms of<br />\nlighting and the shuttle bus. At<br />\nthe end of his speech, he and<br />\nFieldson presented Richardson<br />\nwith a framed aerial photo of the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nTaking the podium, Richardson<br />\ndescribed a letter he had<br />\nreceived from two high school<br />\nstudents from Pennsylvania who<br />\nhad dropped by Hopkins unannounced, casually attending<br />\nclasses and talking to students. In<br />\ncomparison to three other<br />\nprestigious colleges they also<br />\nvisited, the students wrote that<br />\nthey were most impressed with<br />\nHopkins, according to Richardson. \"They found that they were<br />\nmuch more cordially greeted by<br />\nthe students here, and they saw<br />\nContinued on page 3<br />\n<br />\nThis Week\u2022<br />\nIt's been said that \"you<br />\ncan't go home again.\"<br />\nYou can, however, check<br />\nout our trusty Housing<br />\nGuide on p. 10 in<br />\nFeatures.<br />\n<br />\nEditorial continues the<br />\nepic saga of The Miranda<br />\nAct with a cheap alternative to regular housing,<br />\np. 4.<br />\n<br />\nSting sings, brings zing?<br />\nNews-Letter reviews The<br />\nSoul Cages in Arts page 7.<br />\n<br />\nThe Arts Calendar, now<br />\nback by popular demand.<br />\nAnd this time it's for real.<br />\nSee Arts, p. 8.<br />\n<br />\nDomination and swimming: the inside connection<br />\nand championship results<br />\nin Sports, p. 17.<br />\nThe new Meyerhoff<br />\nAuditorium\u2014an architectural diagram for you to<br />\nstudy and color.

Some professors say that<br />\nit cost-effectively provides more<br />\ncourse offerings which will ease<br />\nthe strain of current course<br />\noverenrollment.<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences Jacqueline Mitchell<br />\nstressed that the primary objective of the program is to provide<br />\nexceptionally qualified advanced<br />\ngraduate students with full<br />\nteaching experience, and to allow<br />\nundergraduates to learn from<br />\ntheir expertise.<br />\n<br />\n\"These graduate students will<br />\nbe the creme de la creme,\" Mitchell said. \"The graduate will<br />\nwork closely with and be<br />\nmonitored by their faculty mentor at all times, so the faculty will<br />\nthe<br />\nto<br />\nlinked<br />\nremain<br />\nundergraduates in turn.\"<br />\nJ.B. Schneewind, Professor<br />\nand Chair of the Department of<br />\nPhilosophy, said that his department's needs are such that its<br />\ncourses should only be taught by<br />\nfull-time faculty, and that the<br />\ntime-consuming fellowships may<br />\nslow down the graduate's doctoral work.<br />\n\"We also have a concern for<br />\nthe quality of undergraduate<br />\neducation,\" said Schneewind,<br />\n\"and the quality is best preserved by full-time faculty teaching<br />\nundergraduates.\"<br />\nArmstrong emphasized that the<br />\nfellowships will not replace fulltime faculty, and that the<br />\nfellowships will be awarded<br />\nprimarily on proven teaching<br />\nexcellence.<br />\n\"Graduate students will use<br />\nthis as their entree into university teaching,\" said Armstrong,<br />\n\"so they will work their hearts<br />\nout to make sure that they get<br />\ngood student reviews as \u2022vvell as<br />\ngood reviews by their faculty<br />\n<br />\nmentors.\"<br />\nArmstrong said that his student<br />\nadvisory committee, which is<br />\nmade up of 2 graduates and 7<br />\nundergraduates, generally approved of the program, but Craig<br />\nDubois, a junior and committee<br />\nmember, said:<br />\n\"It may provide a larger pool<br />\nof courses to choose from, but<br />\nundergraduates have mixed emotions because one expects to be<br />\ntaught by a Ph.D. at Hopkins.\"<br />\nRichard Goldthwaite, Chair of<br />\nthe Department of History, said<br />\nthat the fellowship is an imaginative way to relieve the<br />\nburden of overenrollment and that<br />\nfaculty-supervised graduates are<br />\nan excellent teaching resource.<br />\n\"There is a right to be concerned about a situation that could get<br />\nout of control if they [graduate<br />\nstudents] get exploited by a lot of<br />\n<br />\nteaching being turned over to<br />\nthem because of university finansaid<br />\nconstraints,\"<br />\ncial<br />\nGoldthwaite.<br />\nSome chairs have expressed interest in using the fellowship to<br />\noffer more sections of a course<br />\nthat is traditionally overenrolled.<br />\nMitchell said that she will not rule<br />\nout that possibility although it<br />\nruns contrary to the program's intent to create new courses.<br />\nRichard E.

While<br />\narguably taking the position of a<br />\ndispassionate observer, he<br />\nnevertheless availed himopportuniself of the<br />\nty to make sardonic remarks and<br />\nquips about the past four United<br />\nStates presidents and their administrations, much to the delight<br />\nof the audience.<br />\nSome in the audience,<br />\nhowever, were visibly shocked<br />\nwhen Hitchens reserved his<br />\nharshest criticism for the leaders<br />\nof the peace movement, calling<br />\ntheir alleged concern about the<br />\npotential for U.S. casualties<br />\nmoronic and naive.

Each of the three services is now devising its own plan<br />\nfor reductions. Students who<br />\nwant to join the Marine Corps<br />\nenlist in the Navy R.O.T.C.<br />\nprogram.<br />\nMany students see R.O.T.C. as<br />\nan attractive way to pay for college. Students must compete for<br />\nR.O.T.C. scholarships, which<br />\nare offered for one to four years<br />\nand cover the cost of tuition and<br />\nfees. The program also pays for<br />\nbooks and provides a stipend of<br />\n$100 a month for each student.<br />\nAfter graduation, cadets are offered an officer's commission and<br />\nmust serve for at least three years.<br />\nFollowing are the reductions<br />\nplanned so far:<br />\n\u2022 The Air Force will drop the<br />\nnumber of new R.O.T.C.<br />\nscholarships for academic<br />\n1991-92 from 2,100 to 1,900.<br />\n<br />\nThe Air Force now has 16,167<br />\ncadets at the nation's colleges and<br />\nuniversities.<br />\n\u2022 The Navy will cut the number<br />\nof new R.O.T.C. scholarships by<br />\n15 per cent by 1994, according<br />\nto Gregory Stallworth, a<br />\nspokesman for the Chief of Naval<br />\nEducation and Training Office.<br />\nCurrently, 8,783 students are in<br />\nthe naval R.O.T.C. program.<br />\nThe Navy offered 1,708 new<br />\nscholarships in 1990, down from<br />\n1,920 in 1989. The Navy will<br />\nalso close R.O.T.C. programs at<br />\nfive universities and combine 16<br />\nother programs into eight<br />\n\"geographic consortia\" in 1996.<br />\nThe programs to be closed are<br />\nTexas Tech University and the<br />\nUniversities of Minnesota,<br />\nMissouri, New Mexico, and<br />\nUtah.<br />\n\u2022The Army will cut the number<br />\nof new R.O.T.C. scholarships by<br />\n3 percent next year, according to<br />\nMaj. Robert Shepherd, a<br />\nspokesman for the army<br />\nR.O.T.C. The Army offered<br />\n3,028 new scholarships in<br />\nacademic year 1990-91, but will<br />\noffer only 1,830 in academic<br />\n1991-92. Major Shepherd said<br />\nthe decrease was in part the result<br />\nof a plan to award more four-year<br />\nscholarships, instead of the twoyear scholarships that have been<br />\noffered in the past.<br />\nThe scholarship cuts contribute<br />\nto the uncertainty that has surrounded the R.O.T.C. programs<br />\nfor the last several months.<br />\nLast summer, Army officials<br />\nannounced they would close 50 of<br />\nthe 413 Army R.O.T.C. units at<br />\ncolleges and universities as part<br />\nof cutbacks in the military<br />\nbudget.<br />\nIn addition, students and faculty members at several colleges<br />\nand universities want R.O.T.C.<br />\nprograms banned from campuses<br />\nbecause the military services<br />\nContinued on page 3<br />\n<br />\nMiller Criticizes Reporting<br />\n<br />\nCoverage Equated with Propaganda<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nDean of the School of Arts and Sciences Lloyd Armstrong<br />\n<br />\nGraduate Fellowships Allotted<br />\nOn Basis of Department Need<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\nMcCarty said. \"We can't expect<br />\na graduate student to take on the<br />\nresponsibility of teaching a core<br />\ncourse like Molecular Cell<br />\nBiology where the major crunch<br />\ncomes in.\"<br />\nMitchell conceded that the program may not be appropriate for<br />\nevery department, but she said<br />\nthe fellowships are in no way intended to pay a graduate student<br />\nto assist a lab section.

The press'<br />\ntendency to sensationalize and<br />\nrumorize the news appears at<br />\ntimes in their insensitivity and unnecessary willingness to alarm the<br />\npublic, Miller said.<br />\nMiller said that what may not<br />\nbe known is that CBS, ABC and<br />\nNBC are owned by single corporations who actually see such<br />\nstations as monetary 'liabilities,<br />\nespecially with regard to advertising. Due to shrinking audiences, serious technical dif-<br />\n<br />\nficulties and bad advertising<br />\ndollars, Miller foresaw the eventual replacement of some of the<br />\nmajor news networks with CNNlike stations.<br />\nAccording to Miller, the Pentagon's intimidation of the media,<br />\nthe press' insensitivity and<br />\ntroublesome future, and the<br />\ngrowing American resentment<br />\ntoward believing anything in the<br />\nnews further undermine the current reporting of the Middle East<br />\nCrisis. He suggested that the only way to acquire a true, overall<br />\npicture of the reality of the war<br />\nwas to search for as many sources<br />\nof information as possible, while<br />\nkeeping in mind the largely rightwing, colored eyes of large<br />\npapers and T.V. stations, and<br />\nsearching for the black and white<br />\nof the real news.<br />\n<br />\nHitchens Anaylzes<br />\nU.S. Goals in Gulf<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\nwhether the British ever warned<br />\nthe United States of the difficulties of finding a stable<br />\ngovernment for Iraq or of changing the government through air<br />\npower alone, two projects in<br />\nwhich the British failed.<br />\nThe U.S. ambassador to Iraq,<br />\nApril Glaspie, referred to the Iraqi experience with the British<br />\nEmpire: \"We understand your<br />\ngrievances with imperialism.

More recently, there<br />\nwere students who objected to the<br />\n<br />\nthree-day closing of the Hutzler<br />\nLibrary for the celebration of his<br />\ninstallation. After receiving many<br />\npetitions, Richardson reduced the<br />\nclosing time from midnight<br />\nThursday to Saturday morning.<br />\nRichardson then opened the<br />\nfloor to discussion, taking questions from the audience. Asked<br />\nhow he would insure that minority students would be adequately<br />\nrepresented without quotas, he<br />\nsaid that it was necessary to try<br />\nto maintain a balance by looking<br />\nat incoming classes in terms of<br />\ndeveloping a diverse class rather<br />\nthan quotas. He also stressed effective recruitment to bring these<br />\nstudents to Hopkins.<br />\nRichardson also stated his intention to rebuild the French<br />\nDepartment, and described the<br />\n\"raid\" staged by Emory University to lure prominent professors.<br />\n\"It was very clever. I must give<br />\nthem credit for that. They received a $105 million endowment, and similar to the process<br />\nof building a baseball team, went<br />\nout and used the money to attract<br />\nprofessors from Hopkins,<br />\nPrinceton, the University of<br />\nMichigan, and other Universities,\" he said. However,<br />\nRichardson said that the<br />\nmagnitude of the incident was<br />\nblown out of proportion, most<br />\nnotably by the Atlanta Constitution. \"We need to put that behind<br />\nus and invest today. The dollars<br />\nare there, commitments have<br />\nbeen made, and I am confident<br />\nthat the French Department will<br />\nbe restored to its former level, if<br />\nnot higher,\" he said.<br />\n<br />\nDefending Dean Armstrong's<br />\ndecision to reserve 20 positions<br />\nfor graduate students to teach fulltime, Richardson said it was more<br />\naffordable, and these students,<br />\nmany of whom would be on the<br />\nverge of becoming faculty<br />\nmembers, are extremely<br />\nknowledgeable in their respective<br />\nfields.<br />\nAn audience of a hundred attended the convocation, and<br />\ndespite the relatively low turnout,<br />\nRichardson said that he was still<br />\nencouraged by the student participation. However, others did<br />\nnot agree. Senior Suzy Kim said,<br />\n\"There are so many people who<br />\nwhine for change, but if they<br />\ndon't attend these convocations,<br />\nhow do they expect their problems to be solved?\" Sophomore<br />\nKatie Crowley added, \"President<br />\nRichardson has been trying so<br />\nhard to get to know the students<br />\nand their interests, and it's disturbing that the students don't respond to his concern.\"<br />\n<br />\nDOD Plans<br />\nROTC Cuts<br />\n<br />\nLoren Rieth<br />\n<br />\nDemonstrators protest against the CIA recruiters on Tuesday,<br />\nFebruary 19.<br />\n<br />\nWriters!

Oddly<br />\nContinued on page 5<br />\n<br />\nShoveling through the Mail<br />\nThrough the years, and particularly during this year, the NewsLetter has received hundreds of thoughtful, often provocative letters. Their missions are various: some take a stand on campus issues;<br />\nsome respond to opinion pieces or other letters; some warn of growing conspiracies in American politics; and others, rare though they<br />\nare, take the News-Letter to task for its journalistic practices. The<br />\nNews-Letter reads this last group with intense interest and sincere<br />\nconcern. Like most publications, we rely upon our readers to bring<br />\nthings to our attention that slip through editorial cracks: evidence<br />\nof racism or sexism, misquotes or incorrect attribution of quotes,<br />\neditorializing in stories, pertinent isues that repeatedly fail to receive<br />\ncoverage in our pages\u2014the list is potentially infinite. Although errors inevitably do wriggle their way into each issue, the News-Letter<br />\ntries assiduously each week to publish a paper that fairly represents<br />\nboth life at Johns Hopkins and the concerns of the Hopkins Community. Thus we are grateful for these corrections and clarifications;<br />\nthey remind us that every story has unexplored angles, issues that<br />\ndo not automatically float to the surface.<br />\nSometimes, however, the News-Letter hears from readers who have<br />\nmore sweeping accusations to make. Their letters might accuse us<br />\nof doing damage to the University's reputation\u2014or perhaps to an individual's\u2014or of intentionally burying stories that the Hopkins Community has a right to know about. These are seious accusations, stabs<br />\nthat call into question everything that the News-Letter requires to<br />\noperate successfully\u2014the trust of its readers and the belief that the<br />\npaper serves an important function. Recently, three such complaints<br />\nhave been leveled at the News-Letter, two in letters to the editors<br />\nand one in a commentary printed in the Hopkins Spectator. Each<br />\ndeserves a response.<br />\n'Misquoting'\u2014In the February 15 issue of the News-Letter, there<br />\nappeared a letter to the editors by Craig Freeman, who accused staff<br />\nreporter Harry Milling of \"severely misquoting\" him in a February<br />\n8 article about Phi Mu's opportunity to move into Rogers House.<br />\nThe quotation at issue was Freeman's statement that some administrators believed that \"a fraternity's occupation of Rogers House<br />\nmight not 'run as smoothly' as a sorority's occupation might.\" This,<br />\nFreeman said, \"inferred [implied] that administrators felt that fraternities would not adhere to University regulations. . ..\" Freeman went<br />\non to \"caution both Mr. Milling and the News-Letter against misquoting interviewees in order to add validity to a specific writer's<br />\nopinion. As journalists it is your responsibility to present the facts<br />\nFirst, and most important, the News-Letter has never knowingly<br />\nfabricated or distorted facts or quotations within an article. Milling<br />\ninterviewed Freeman three times for the Phi Mu article; during the<br />\nsecond of these, he confirmed the quotation that Freeman disavowed in his letter. In light of this, Freeman's accusations\u2014that Milling misquoted him and that he did so to support his own view of<br />\nthe fraternityissue\u2014seem particularly out of place. The News-Letter<br />\nstands by Milling's article as fair and correct in its entirety.<br />\n'Deliberate Ambiguity'\u2014The February 1991 issue of the Hopkins<br />\nSpectator contained an intriguing reference to News-Letter turpitude.<br />\nThe item appeared in the magazine's Editors' Letter, which discussed<br />\nthe Uniersity's need for a \"conservative voice of dissent\" as well<br />\nas its overall state of decay. The editors alluded to the University's<br />\nrecent shuffling of faculty in departments throughout the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences\u2014the product of much backroom academic and<br />\nbudgetary wrangling\u2014and decried the News-Letter's two recent articles on the subject as \"deliberately ambiguous.\"<br />\nThere are two possible criticisms here: 1)that the News-Letter was<br />\ncovering up dirty secrets to help out the administration; 2) that the<br />\nissue simply didn't interest the News-Letter enough to elicit good news<br />\ncoverage. Both implications are false. Even the idea that the News-<br />\n<br />\nLetter was working to protect administrative interests, particularly<br />\nwhen the issue directly affects students and faculty\u2014is pretty close<br />\nto hilarious. Staff reporters for our paper consistently have trouble<br />\ngetting interviews with high-level administrators, and even more difficulty obtaining quotations for the record, because the paper is<br />\nperceived as anti-administration. When the suits in Garland want to<br />\nbury a story, as a rule, they just keep away from the News-Letter,<br />\nhoping that the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed accounts of University prosperity in the Gazette will deflect the attention of prospective and<br />\ncurrent students alike.<br />\nTo the second implication posed in the Spectator\u2014that the story<br />\nwasn't considered important by News-Letter editors\u2014we plead not<br />\nguilty. The News-Letter spent over a month collecting data and holding<br />\ninterviews with faculty members to flush out the details of the topsecret numbers involved in the Armstrong-Richardson faculty plan.<br />\nWe were refused access to any detailed summary of the changes within<br />\nArts and Sciences departments; as aresult, we attempted to build our<br />\nown by interviewing the head of every department affected by the<br />\nchange. Although some of the interviewees were candid about the<br />\nmeasures, many refused comment and others simply failed to return<br />\nrepeated phone calls. In the end, the data we assembled was not<br />\nsubstantial enough to present a complete\u2014and, we felt, honest\u2014<br />\npicture of the numbers involved. The articles that resulted reflected<br />\nthis omission, but they also gave a sense of how several department<br />\nheads were reacting to sharp alterations in departmental budgets. We<br />\nencourage the Spectator to publish a full set of figures regarding the<br />\nchanges if it has access to them\u2014this would be a tremendous service to the Hopkins Community.<br />\nBlame not the criminals, but the News-Letter\u2014In a letter to the<br />\neditor this week, Director of Security Major Robert Larkin makes<br />\naccusations that, while simple on the surface, suggest an ominous<br />\nundercurrent. Not surprisingly, the majority of these are directed at<br />\nthe News-Letter, which has been dogged in its criticism of Hopkins<br />\nSecurity this year. Responding to an editorial last week that pointed<br />\nout Security's lapse in preparing the Community Crime Report\u2014a<br />\ndocument that keeps track of off-campus crimes committed against<br />\nHopkins students\u2014Larkin charged that the News-Letter \"has regularly<br />\nfailed to pick up the [Community Crime Report] as they did in the<br />\npast.\" Larkin also blames the News-Letter for community ignorance<br />\nabout the Hopkins Escort Van service. \"I have never read in the<br />\nNewsletter [sic] about [the vans],\" he wrote, adding that the paper<br />\nalso \"would not print an escort poster we requested to be printed.\"<br />\nLarkin's memory lapse is puzzling. Despite his assertions, the Community Crime Report was first compiled for the News-Letter last fall,<br />\nin response to an editorial asking for realistic statistics about crimes<br />\ncommitted off-campus. The only crime report Security had produced regularly in the past is the functional but tedious Campus Crime<br />\nReport, a collection of incidents mainly involving thefts from desk<br />\ndrawers and from gym lockers in the Athletic Center. This data is<br />\nnot irrelevant, but it is far less important than the Community Crime<br />\nReport. If Larkin were as committed to student safety and awareness<br />\nas he claims to be, he would resume its compilation immediately.<br />\nLarkin's accusation that the News-Letter refused to print an escort<br />\nposter is a half-truth. What Larkin was requesting, in effect, was<br />\nfree advertising space over an indefinite period of time\u2014a privilege<br />\nregularly asked of the News-Letter by dozens of other campus<br />\norganizations. What the News-Letter offered to do was to run notices<br />\nabout the escort service, as well as any other relevant Security data,<br />\nalong with the Community Crime Report\u2014which, as mentioned<br />\nbefore, has not been released once this semester. Larkin has a standing forum in the News-Letter in which to present any information<br />\nhe feels important to the safety of the Hopkins Community. The NewsLetter provided that space; we did not take it away.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nSecurity Reiterates Its Ralson d'Etre<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe in Security have a genuine<br />\nconcern 'for the students at the<br />\nHomewood Campus.

Incinerators are<br />\nsome of the greatest contaminators of our air, having been<br />\ncited for mercury, lead, and hundreds of other known toxins, yet<br />\nthe Clean Air Act, in sections 306<br />\nand 307, issues 30 years permits<br />\nto these incinerators instead of the<br />\nprevious 5 year permits and<br />\nreclassifies incinerator ash from<br />\n\"toxic\" to \"special waste.\"<br />\n\"Special waste\" is not as strongly regualated as \"toxic waste,\"<br />\nand may be disposed of without<br />\nEPA restrictions. This is an example of a similar problem in<br />\nwhich the costs are absorbed by<br />\na small group of people without<br />\npolitical power. Thus the costs<br />\nthey bear are not considered in<br />\neconomic feasibility studies.<br />\nThe Christian Science Monitor<br />\nhas reported that starting last<br />\nmonth a garbage dumping company will be paying the Lakota<br />\nSioux less than a dollar a ton to<br />\ndump garbage on their reservation land.

On the reservation the dumping company is exempt from<br />\nstrong state regulations and<br />\nanswers only to weak federal<br />\nstandards.<br />\n<br />\nIndustries refuse to stop<br />\npolluting because they say that the<br />\ncost would be prohibitive.

Many environmental<br />\nconcerns are ignored in the name<br />\nof a growing economy, but more<br />\noften than not the environmentally sound methods are more<br />\neconomical than the methods proposed in the name of the<br />\neconomy.<br />\nPart of the problem is that certain shared costs are not factored<br />\ninto cost analyses. If an industry<br />\ncan spread some of its costs<br />\nacross the population, it won't<br />\nfactor those costs into an<br />\neconomic plan. Pollution is a<br />\nclassic example of this \"problem<br />\nof the commons.\" The Clean Air<br />\nAct of 1990 was almost defeated<br />\nbecause of Midwestern coalburning companies that didn't<br />\nwant to pay for pollution controls.<br />\nUnfortunately, acid rain caused<br />\nby the burning coal does not<br />\ndirectly cost these industries<br />\nmoney.

Simon and<br />\nMazursky also teamed up on last<br />\nyear's outstanding Enemies, A<br />\nLove Story. Apparently, they've<br />\nbeen living on creative meat<br />\nscraps ever since.<br />\nEnemies is a thoughtful,<br />\nspirited film filled with<br />\ncherishable moments. Scenes<br />\nFrom a Mall is just the opposite.<br />\nBland and charmless, Mazursky's<br />\nlatest makes running up the down<br />\nescalator at Owings Mills look<br />\nlike the most exciting afternoon<br />\nimaginable.<br />\nAllen is Los Angeles sports<br />\nagent Nick Fifer, celebrating his<br />\nsixteenth wedding anniversary to<br />\nsuccessful pop psychologist<br />\nDeborah (Midler). After sending<br />\n<br />\nthe kids off to a weekend retreat,<br />\nthey bubble bathe together and<br />\nplan a celebratory dinner party,<br />\nonly occasionally interrupted by<br />\nbusiness calls on their separate<br />\nphone lines.<br />\nWhat busy, uninteresting lives<br />\nthey lead! Aside from the rather<br />\nnauseating concept of Midler and<br />\nAllen making love, these opening<br />\nscenes are lengthy and unrevealing. The actors work well<br />\ntogether, a natural ease evident in<br />\nthe banter, but the exchanges are<br />\nso boring that it makes little difference. Is this what we have to<br />\nlook forward to in marriage?<br />\nMazursky and Simon establish<br />\nthe couple's relationship with<br />\nsuch a minimum of enthusiasm<br />\nthat one is hard pressed to care.<br />\nNick and Deborah are people you<br />\nwouldn't want as parents,<br />\nspouses, friends, or even pets.<br />\nYou'd invite them to dinner when<br />\nyour first choice got the flu.<br />\nNick and Deborah decide to<br />\nspend their special day at a mall<br />\nin Beverly Hills, exchanging gifts<br />\nand buying sushi for the evening's feast. A romantic afternoon<br />\nturns sour when Nick admits he's<br />\nbeen having an affair for seven<br />\n<br />\nmonths. After heated discussions<br />\nand marital angst (translation:<br />\nMidler does that hysterical thing),<br />\nthey reach a temporary truce.<br />\nYet Deborah has some secrets<br />\nof her own, and later confesses<br />\na fling with a fellow psychiatrist.<br />\nRound two of marital hell<br />\nfollows, with Deborah and Nick<br />\nboth groping for answers in<br />\nanother frustrating verbal chase<br />\naround the shopping center. The<br />\nending is admirably unsettled<br />\n(especially for Touchstone Pictures, kings of the happy ending),<br />\nbut after enduring the rest of the<br />\nfilm, the audience deserves<br />\nbetter.<br />\nThe crisis takes place entirely<br />\nin the Beverly Hills mall, with<br />\nMazursky and Simon contriving<br />\nreason after reason for them to remain there. If you thought a shopping center was a dull setting,<br />\nyou're right. As if a collapsing<br />\nmarriage of two whiners weren't<br />\nmaddening enough, Mazursky's<br />\npresentation of the shopping mall<br />\nas late twentieth century cultural<br />\ncontext is downright suicideinducing.<br />\nMazursky and Simon aim<br />\nseveral gentle barbs at the L.A.<br />\n<br />\nlifestyles along the way\u2014the car<br />\nphones, the traffic, the inescapable, irritating facade of<br />\nhappiness\u2014but they fall far short<br />\nof the mark, Steve Martin's<br />\nlatest, L.A. Story, is a far more<br />\nprecise take on this hideous<br />\nAmerican subculture.<br />\nMuch of the problem is Allen.<br />\nPony-tailed and gussied up in<br />\ntrendy garb, he is unconvincing<br />\nfrom his first moments on screen.<br />\nWhen Allen has acted in the past,<br />\nhe's been far more effective playing himself\u2014on the opposite<br />\ncoast. It's a credit to his ability<br />\n(and historic lack of self-respect)<br />\nthat he makes it through the ninety minute film at all.<br />\nNick is forty years old, but<br />\nAllen looks like he hasn't been<br />\nthat young in forty years. Either<br />\nthe West coast sun has been playing wicked tricks on Nick's face,<br />\nor he has progeria, that rapid aging disease. You make the call.<br />\nIf the story were engaging, the<br />\ndialogue witty, or the setting<br />\nsomething other than a shopping<br />\ncenter, Scenes From a Mall might<br />\nbe worth watching. But it fails on<br />\nall three counts. Few films so effectively alienate their audience<br />\n<br />\nNick and Deborah Fifer (Woody Allen and Bette Midler) share their<br />\ninfidelities in Scenes From A Mall.<br />\n<br />\nfrom the story.<br />\nFilms about the complexities of<br />\nlife are often the best films of all.<br />\nScenes From a Mall is out to give<br />\nlife a bad name. Instead of spending freely at the mall, Mazursky,<br />\n<br />\nMidler, and Allen ought to be a<br />\nlittle more selective in their purchases.

Kern<br />\nHere's the scene: you stand at<br />\nthe edge of an expanse of<br />\nwater\u2014an ocean, a gigantic<br />\nemerald sea\u2014and in the distance<br />\nyou see an enormous ship, creeping along the horizon. Big boat,<br />\nyou think to yourself, awed at the<br />\nfigure it cuts against the sky. You<br />\nwonder if it might be a tanker,<br />\nwallowing under the weight of<br />\nmillions of gallons of oil, or a<br />\ncargo ship whose innards have<br />\nbeen stuffed with exotic goods for<br />\na long maritime voyage.<br />\nOne thing is certain: a ship that<br />\nbig must be carrying an important payload, something essential<br />\nto the welfare of humankind. Not<br />\nknowing why, you feel an<br />\nallegiance with it, and watch it<br />\nskim imperceptibly across the line<br />\nbetween sea and sky.<br />\nWhen the ship is gone\u2014out of<br />\nsight, the event concluded\u2014you<br />\nlook around to see how the world<br />\nhas changed. Nothing. Everything looks the same. The surface<br />\nof the water is vacant, the beach<br />\ndeserted, the wind still blows<br />\nthrough the whispering palms<br />\noverhead. The only thing different is the time: you've spent<br />\nan hour fixated on something that<br />\nhas disappeared without a trace.<br />\nThat, in short, describes the experience of listening to The Soul<br />\nCages, the latest album by Sting.<br />\nGrand in scope, impressively<br />\nconstructed, and laden with<br />\nimages of skylines and sailing,<br />\nthe fourth solo outing by the wellgroomed Gordon Sumner is a<br />\nrecord that sits stubbornly in anchor for almost all of its forty-five<br />\nminutes. As it plays, it sounds<br />\ncoherent, important, even<br />\n<br />\nmagical, but after the last song<br />\nfades the listener sits there stranded with a feeling of stuffed<br />\nhollowness\u2014the emotional<br />\nequivalent of a stomach full of<br />\ncheese puffs.<br />\nIt's a surprising result given the<br />\napparent depth of the album. The<br />\nSoul Cages is host to a plethora<br />\nof recurring images and allusions:<br />\nfatherhood, death, the sea, ships,<br />\nthe cleansing power of water, and<br />\nothers. It's a catalog with an<br />\nundeniable literary pedigree, rich<br />\nwith romantic associations of<br />\nhardship and courage, and Sting<br />\n<br />\nThe Soul Cages<br />\nfinds Sting in new<br />\nand often<br />\nridiculous form.<br />\ninjects them liberally into his<br />\nmaterial. \"The Wild Wild Sea\"<br />\nrecounts an episode in which the<br />\nnarrator one day sees a ship on<br />\nthe horizon that sporadically appears and disappears. That night,<br />\nwalking in his sleep, he imagines<br />\nthat he swims out to the ship,<br />\ndiscovers it stuck in irons, and<br />\nfalls asleep, only to wake as an<br />\nominous gale begins to toss the<br />\nvessel on the water.<br />\nFor the discerning listener who<br />\nasks, \"So what?\" Sting has a<br />\nready reply. Near the end of the<br />\nnarrative, our hero sees the<br />\n\"shade of a sailor/On the bridge<br />\nthrough the wheelhouse pane.\"<br />\nBut this isn't any ordinary ghost,<br />\nfor \"underneath the sailor's hat,\"<br />\n<br />\nhe reveals after a melodramatic<br />\npause, \"I saw my father's face.\"<br />\nIn the right hands, this fairly<br />\nconventional narrative could<br />\nperhaps survive a performance by<br />\na rock band. But Sting, with his<br />\nperennial love for the highfalutin, turns \"The Wild Wild<br />\nSea,\" like the majority of The<br />\nSoul Cages, into little more than<br />\na tawdry poolside poetry reading.<br />\nHe lingers wistfully over<br />\nsyllables, as if contemplating<br />\nissues of profound philosophical<br />\nimport, and delivers completely<br />\nmaudlin lines (\"All around me<br />\nwas silence/As if mocking my<br />\nfrail human hopes\") as if they<br />\nwere scripture\u2014or poetry, for<br />\nthat matter.<br />\nThough Sting has made no<br />\nsecret of his poetic aspirations<br />\nover the years (his last album,<br />\n...Nothing Like the Sun,took its<br />\ntitle from a Shakespearean sonnet), The Soul Cages finds him in<br />\nnew and often ridiculous form.<br />\nThe majority of songs here are<br />\nwritten in rigid meter, with accompanying rhyme schemes that<br />\nmight flow nicely if Sting weren't<br />\nso intent on letting the listener<br />\nknow\u2014by singing in halting<br />\nphrases\u2014how \"well structured\"<br />\nthey are.<br />\nHe has an affection for lofty<br />\nsounding words and phrases: people in these songs don't walk in<br />\ntheir sleep, but in their<br />\n\"slumber\"; there are no ghosts<br />\non this record, but \"shades.\"<br />\nGone is the subtlety that made<br />\nmany of the Police's albums so<br />\nengaging, and left in its place is<br />\nSting who, despite an occasional<br />\napt phrase, now merely acts as if<br />\nhis lyrics carry meaning. Despite<br />\nContinued on page 8<br />\n<br />\nby Paul Kramer<br />\nIf you've ever stayed up all<br />\nnight arguing if God is dead, if<br />\ndemocracy is really possible, or<br />\nif it's nature or nurture that makes<br />\nboys seem different from girls,<br />\nthen you need to get hold of a<br />\ncopy of A World of Ideas II. In<br />\nhis second volume, Bill Moyers<br />\ntakes on the biggest issues of our<br />\ntime with, not surprisingly, some<br />\nof the greatest thinkers of our<br />\ntime.<br />\nIn his introduction, Moyers<br />\ndescribes the history of<br />\ndemocracy as the history of a particular kind of conversation. In<br />\nearly America, the printing press<br />\nproduced a community whose<br />\ncentral feature was common<br />\nnews, and whose dialogues and<br />\ndebates, in taverns and public<br />\nsquares, allowed our young<br />\ndemocracy to work. The news<br />\nprovided the underlying social<br />\nfabric of the American public,<br />\nand the press's most important<br />\ntask was to take that public<br />\nseriously.<br />\nBut, according to Moyers, the<br />\nnature of that public has fundamentally changed. Americans no<br />\nlonger talk to each other about<br />\nideas, and in that silence, our<br />\npublic discourse and political<br />\nconsciousness have withered.<br />\nWhere our forefathers argued for<br />\nhours in the public greens, we are<br />\npacified by 9-second sound-bites<br />\nin front of the tube. We have<br />\nbecome spectators of our own<br />\ndemocracy, handing over control<br />\nto those politicians that entertain<br />\nus most, and keep us thinking the<br />\nleast.<br />\nThe situation is not without<br />\nhope, however. While our<br />\ntechnology has given us the tools<br />\nof our own lobotomization (i.e.<br />\nTV news), it has also given us<br />\nways to restart the energetic<br />\ndialogue that democracy requires<br />\n(i.e. publishing a new book). A<br />\nWorld ofIdeas H is the natural extension of this belief: 29 interviews with an eclectic mix of<br />\nthinkers, each of which brings his<br />\nown unique perspective to the<br />\nproblems we face as individuals<br />\nand as a society.<br />\nBill Moyers, whose name<br />\ncould follow the words \"this intellectual brought to you by,\"<br />\nshows himself to be one of the<br />\ngreat askers-of-questions here. As<br />\nin his thought-provoking interviews with mythologist Joseph<br />\nCampbell, Moyers displays a<br />\nremarkable capacity for cutting to<br />\nthe crucial issues, forcing his subjects into corners, confronting<br />\nthem with their contradictions,<br />\nand evoking their logic and<br />\nunderstanding. In the process,<br />\n<br />\neach subject's world-view is illuminated in all its complexity.<br />\nBut more impressive than<br />\nMoyers himself are the people he<br />\nis able to bring to us through<br />\nthese interviews. Their interests<br />\ncome from nearly every realm of<br />\nhuman existance, from political<br />\ndynamics to philosophies of art to<br />\ndeep matters of the spirit. They<br />\naren't scholarly bones hiding inside big and hollow language<br />\neither; these are people that are<br />\nable to articulate their ideas to the<br />\nreader with remarkable clarity<br />\nand wit.

How are we to<br />\n<br />\nunderstand our identities in an increasingly multi-cultural environment? What ethical role does the<br />\nindividual play in a complex<br />\ntechnological world? While<br />\nphilosophical in nature, these are<br />\nalso the hottest political topics of<br />\nour time\u2014racial conflict, artistic<br />\ncensorship, abortion rights and<br />\nenvironmental concerns among<br />\nthem.<br />\nThese are issues you can find<br />\nin any national news magazine<br />\nevery week, painted there broadly<br />\nwith ideology and sarcasm. But<br />\nwhat makes this account different<br />\nis not only its clarity and intelligence, but its implicit call to<br />\naction. This is a book that gets<br />\nyou somewhere, that manages to<br />\nconvince you of the most central<br />\nof all democratic tenets: that you<br />\ncan make a difference.<br />\nWhile it could be argued that<br />\n29 broad opinions don't make \"a<br />\nworld of ideas,\" Moyers is<br />\ncareful never to claim they are.<br />\nRather, for him, these discussions<br />\nare a kind of intellectual jumpstart, the initial point of an even<br />\ngrander and more fruitful<br />\ndialogue. He isn't trying to sell<br />\nus on his subjects' books, or even<br />\non the ideas they espouse. He is<br />\ntrying to sell us on the idea of<br />\nhaving ideas in the first place.<br />\nAnd while A World of Ideas 11<br />\nmay not get hordes of citizens<br />\ndebating in the public squares, it<br />\nmay pull us from MTV long<br />\nenough to get us talking again.

You'll be<br />\nthe better for it.<br />\n<br />\nContinued from page 7<br />\na wash of literary allusions, all<br />\nthat lingers is Sting's illusion that<br />\nthese lyrics are deep and<br />\nmeaningful.<br />\nFor all his shortcomings as a<br />\nlyricist, however, Sting has<br />\nalways been a strong composer.<br />\nDuring his tenure with the Police<br />\nand throughout his solo career, he<br />\nhas been a perpetual source of<br />\nrich melodies and harmonies, of<br />\nhooks that linger in the brain long<br />\nafter most Top 40 ear candy is<br />\nforgotten. His skill as an arranger, particularly on The<br />\nDream of the Blue Turtles, his<br />\nfirst<br />\nsolo<br />\nalbum,<br />\nwas<br />\nunimpeachable.<br />\nIt is no surprise, then, that The<br />\nSoul Cages contains some exceptional music. What is surprising<br />\nis how consistently Sting manages<br />\nto dilute it\u2014as well as the band<br />\nperforming it\u2014in a swarm of<br />\nelectronic effects. Apparently<br />\ntickled with the endless<br />\npossibilities of his Synclavier<br />\nsampling instrument, he has infested the album with a landscape<br />\nof hums and drones which give<br />\nthe impression that the band<br />\n(which includes such talents as<br />\nBranford Marsalis, Kenny<br />\nKirkland, and David Sanctious)<br />\nis either going to dissolve,<br />\nevaporate, or simply be<br />\nsmothered.<br />\nAnd if much of The Soul Cages<br />\nsounds friendly and familiar,<br />\nthere's a reason: several of the<br />\nhooks are cribbed from Police<br />\nrecords. \"Mad About You\" is a<br />\ncompendium of snippets from<br />\nSynchronicity and Ghost In the<br />\nMachine, while \"When the<br />\nAngels Fall\" lifts a slice of<br />\n\"Every Breath You Take\"<br />\npiecemeal.<br />\nIt's<br />\nSting's<br />\nprerogative to reuse his own<br />\nmaterial, of course, but the songs<br />\nthat result\u2014like recycled<br />\npaper\u2014seem dull and motheaten, despite their perfect sonic<br />\nsheen.<br />\nThe album isn't a total wash.<br />\nThe first track, \"Island of<br />\n<br />\nSouls,\" is a dreamy 6/4 dirge that<br />\nmovingly recounts the fantasies<br />\nof a young boy whose shipbuilding father is killed in an industrial accident. \"All This<br />\nTime,\" the record's first single,<br />\ntranscends its self-important<br />\nlyrics with a joyful, rippling<br />\nmelody and sharp drumming by<br />\nManu Katche. And \"Jeremiah<br />\nBlues (Part I)\" brings the album<br />\nas close to the boiling point as<br />\nSting is likely to get (that is to<br />\nsay, lukewarm), and gives the<br />\nrecord a much-needed dose of<br />\nbite.<br />\nThe norm for The Soul Cages,<br />\nhowever, is smooth, antiseptic<br />\nbackground music\u2014a blend that<br />\nwould sound utterly inhuman if<br />\nnot for Sting's often gargantuan<br />\nflights of pretentiousness at the<br />\nmicrophone. When he sings,<br />\nregrettably, he enunciates, pressing the syllables, heaving oxygen<br />\ninto the microphone until he<br />\nsounds almost abnormally mannered, as if he were John<br />\nHouseman reciting the lyrics of<br />\nDef Leppard.<br />\nIf all this sounds a bit extreme,<br />\nit is. The Soul Cages, like both<br />\nof the studio albums that preceded it, is yet another product of<br />\nSting's desire to make not merely records, but musical<br />\ndocuments of his thoughts and<br />\nfeelings. And though he has probably always loved the sound of<br />\nhis own voice, Sting's singing on<br />\nthis record threatens\u2014quite<br />\nliterally\u2014to overpower the<br />\ndwindling music behind it.<br />\nThis would be well and good<br />\nif the lyrics here weren't such a<br />\ntitanic disappointment. But ships<br />\nand sails and lost sailors' tales require a sharp ear for cliche and<br />\na good sense of humor, both of<br />\nwhich Sting lacks. With a band<br />\ndrowned out by the winds of<br />\nSynclavier and vocals that belong<br />\nin \"The Whine of the Ancient<br />\nMariner,\" The Soul Cages passes<br />\nwith the air of importance, but<br />\nleaves the listener with a sense of<br />\noceanic emptiness.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\n<br />\nBARN<br />\n5TORMER5<br />\n<br />\n,Y1<br />\n(Midsummer a\\light's<br />\n<br />\npresent...<br />\nralb\u20221111.<br />\n<br />\nSTC4CIM<br />\njebruary 22, 23 81c24<br />\n1991<br />\n(8pm each night)<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\n,Arellano qhQatre, Levering atoll<br />\nJohns Itopkins `University<br />\n<br />\nStudents: $3.<br />\ngeneral: $4.<br />\n<br />\nWilliam Shakespeare<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/9<br />\n<br />\nDo You Want VISA & MasterCard Credit Cards?<br />\ndir AM \u2022<br />\n\u2022 111<br />\n1111 \u2022 MIMI \u2022 111<br />\nt IONI<br />\n= IM<br />\n11.

The area<br />\naround the Homewood campus<br />\nisn't a suburban paradise or a<br />\ntypical college town, it's an old<br />\nsection of a major city, and has<br />\nall the perils one might expect.<br />\nDon't take your safety for<br />\ngranted. When you're looking for<br />\napartments, check for grilles over<br />\nthe windows that can be reached<br />\nfrom street level. (Don't forget<br />\nfire escape windows.) Outside<br />\ndoors should have solid deadbolt<br />\nlocks; an intercom that allows<br />\nyou to screen your visitors is<br />\n<br />\nLife, liberty and the pursuit of housing<br />\npus. Probably the safest of large apartment buildings facing<br />\nHopkins neighborhoods; pro- the north edge of campus. Decepbably the dullest, too.

Why live in a different zip code, you ask? Because<br />\nit is the Carlyle, and as such, you<br />\nget all the benefits of a renovated<br />\nhotel.

The trek to<br />\nthe lower quad is upwards of fifteen minutes, but proximity to the<br />\nRotunda is a definite plus which<br />\nalmost makes up for the<br />\ninconvenience.<br />\nStudents comprise only about<br />\na third of all Hopkins House<br />\nresidents, so the atmosphere is<br />\nquite conducive to studying.<br />\nTenants include young families,<br />\nretirees, professors, and grad<br />\nstudents.

Despite these measures,<br />\nthere were a few burglaries in the<br />\nfall, but these no longer seem to<br />\nbe a problem.<br />\n<br />\nMaintenance is quick, but not<br />\nnecessarily effective. Also, a<br />\nroach problem has surfaced in the<br />\nlast few months.

Parking<br />\nprivileges in the garage and<br />\nmembership in the health club or<br />\ntanning salon are available for an<br />\nextra fee.<br />\nFor the student who doesn't<br />\nmind a lot of exercise and a certain degree of isolation from the<br />\nHopkins community, Hopkins<br />\nHouse should definitely be a consideration. Certainly the apartments could be better maintained, but their condition is far<br />\nfrom deplorable, and on a student's budget, probably not much<br />\nbetter is to be found in the area.<br />\n<br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\n<br />\nThe Mayfair<br />\n<br />\nThe Mayfair<br />\nIf you are looking for a convenient place to live, consider the<br />\nMayfair apartments.

The<br />\nMayfair, like other buildings in<br />\n<br />\nthe area, also has its problems<br />\nwith mice and roaches although<br />\nthe more sanitary you keep your<br />\napartment, the fewer problems<br />\nyou'll have.<br />\nProblems with noise are expected when you are situated on<br />\n33rd Street between Charles and<br />\nSt. Paul. The presence of Alpha<br />\nDelta Phi fraternity is sometimes<br />\na problem for those on the side<br />\nof the building near it. The side<br />\nof the building away from the<br />\nfraternity has its own noise problems, particularly an early<br />\n(around 4-5 a.m.) garbage truck<br />\nwhich comes to haul away trash<br />\nfrom the Blackstone and<br />\nPizzApeel. Still, the noise really<br />\nis not all that bad, and one soon<br />\nlearns to sleep right through it.<br />\nThe only occupants of the<br />\nMayfair are students, although ,<br />\nlike McCoy, the doors are usually<br />\nshut.<br />\nSecurity does not really exist at<br />\nthe Mayfair. At the beginning of<br />\n<br />\nthe year, a combination lock was<br />\nplaced upon the front door to<br />\ndiscourage potential burglars, but<br />\nanyone who is persistent enough<br />\ncan get in. However, it somehow<br />\nseems to have deterred thieves.<br />\nThe management has made improvements over the past few<br />\nyears, including the lock on the<br />\nfront door, a commitment to exterminate for mice and roaches<br />\nevery month, and a fairly attentive maintenance characterizes a<br />\nwillingness to address the tenants'<br />\nconcerns. Air conditioning is still<br />\nlacking, though.<br />\nThose interested in living in the<br />\nMayfair must consider the annoying problems of mice, roaches,<br />\nnoise, and not-so-incredible<br />\napartment conditions.

Heat<br />\nand water are included, but<br />\nresidents are required to pay for<br />\ngas, electricity, and telephone.<br />\nThe Charles and the Blackstone<br />\nare extremely popular for<br />\nHopkins students because of their<br />\n<br />\ngreat locations. Students can<br />\ncatch some extra sleep before<br />\ntheir first class and hop onto campus within seconds. WaWa, Eddie's and the bank are only<br />\nminutes away. The escort van<br />\nleaves from the library across the<br />\nstreet for Rotunda shopping.<br />\nThe condition of the two<br />\nbuildings, however, leaves much<br />\nto be desired. A major complaint<br />\nof the residents is the frequent<br />\nbreakdowns of the elevators.<br />\nSince both buildings have ten<br />\nfloors, the climb can take quite<br />\na toll on tired and out-of-shape<br />\nstudents. Some of the apartments<br />\nhave also been known to have<br />\nroaches. Yet the maintenance<br />\ncrew and the management are<br />\nquick and effective. They are<br />\nwilling to work with the residents<br />\nand make a huge effort to fix any<br />\n<br />\nproblems that may arise.<br />\nThe security of the Charles and<br />\nthe Blackstone consists of a<br />\nvisitors' intercom at the entrance<br />\nof the lobby.

Robberies<br />\nare rare but have been known to<br />\noccur, especially in the apartments on the lower floors.<br />\nLaundry facilities are offered in<br />\nthe buildings' basements. As expected, the residents of the<br />\nCharles and the Blackstone are<br />\nprimarily Hopkins students but<br />\nthe atmosphere tends to be quiet.<br />\nDespite several problems, the<br />\nCharles and the Blackstone are<br />\nexcellent choices for Hopkins<br />\nstudents\u2014especially for those<br />\nwho like to scrounge for every<br />\nlast minute of sleep.<br />\n<br />\nRowhouses<br />\n<br />\nA row of rowhouses<br />\n<br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\n<br />\nThe Charles<br />\n<br />\nDoreen Patron<br />\n<br />\nRowhouses offer unique offcampus living arrangements, and<br />\nlike apartment buildings, one can<br />\nexpect to find the full spectrum<br />\nof quality. Some rowhouses are<br />\nmodern, spacious and immaculately clean, rivaling the<br />\nmost luxurious of apartments.<br />\nOther times, houses can be older,<br />\nconfining or just plain shabby. In<br />\ngeneral, you get what you pay<br />\nfor, and thus it is important to<br />\nshop carefully when selecting a<br />\nrowhouse. As a rule of thumb,<br />\nrowhouses are slightly cheaper<br />\nthan apartment buildings.<br />\nAs houses come in all assortments and varieties, so do<br />\nlandlords. Some of these<br />\nlandlords will be extremely personable, helping you with all of<br />\nyour housing and living needs at<br />\na moment's notice. Others will be<br />\ndelaying and/or absent-minded,<br />\nunknowingly making your living<br />\narrangement a year-long<br />\nnightmare. Assessing a landlord<br />\nusually requires some prior<br />\nknowledge; that is, knowing<br />\nsomeone else who has rented<br />\nfrom a particular landlord before.<br />\nIf this option is not possible, the<br />\nUniversity housing office may<br />\nalso help steer you toward more<br />\n<br />\nreliable rowhouse options.<br />\nSome rowhouses are actual trilevel abodes, accommodating up<br />\nto five people. Other rowhouses<br />\nare divided into smaller units,<br />\nranging from one-person efficiencies to four-person apartments.<br />\nThe myths that you need five people to live in a rowhouse setting<br />\nare blatantly false.<br />\nThings to look for in a<br />\nrowhouse are integrity: Is it<br />\nvisibly damaged anywhere? Will<br />\nit stay warm in the winter, and<br />\ncool in the summer? Maryland<br />\nlaw requires all houses to have<br />\nsufficient heating systems for the<br />\nwinter months. Does the house<br />\nneed painting'? Many landlords<br />\nwill supply paint and supplies,<br />\noften free of charge. Security is<br />\nanother matter to consider. Most<br />\nrowhouses have only a durable<br />\nlock on their front door. As you<br />\napproach Greenmount Avenue to<br />\nthe east and Twenty-ninth Street<br />\nto the south, the risk of crime<br />\nbecomes greater, while the<br />\naverage quality and price of the<br />\nhouses decrease sharply.<br />\nMost of the rowhouses that<br />\nstudents rent are in Charles<br />\nVillage, concentrated upon St.<br />\nPaul Street, Calvert Street and<br />\n<br />\nGuilford Avenue. Many find the<br />\nwalk to campus averaging from<br />\n5 to 20 minutes, depending on<br />\nwhere you live. Many houses are<br />\nconvenient to the 'St. Paul Strip',<br />\nwhich includes Eddie's Supermarket and the Maryland National Bank. The Rotunda, with<br />\nits Giant supermarket, lies farther<br />\naway (up to three miles). Not all<br />\nrowhouses have laundry<br />\nmachines; some must carry their<br />\nclothes to a nearby laundrymat<br />\n(the St. Paul Strip has two). This<br />\nsometimes poses a great disadvantage to rowhouse living.<br />\nAll in all, rowhouse living can<br />\nbe a great and rewarding experience. Their codes and regulations are often less stringent than<br />\napartment buildings; thus, they<br />\npotentially can offer more<br />\nfreedoms. However, rowhouses<br />\ncan lack the modern conveniences<br />\nand efficient service that apartment dwellers take for granted.<br />\nMake sure that you have well<br />\nchecked into all of the aspects of<br />\na rowhouse before signing a<br />\nlease. If possible, talk to friends<br />\nthat now live in rowhouses to get<br />\nthe full and complete story.<br />\n<br />\nWyman Towers<br />\nWyman Towers is the<br />\nyellowish brick building conveniently located on the corner of<br />\nSt. Paul and 31st Streets, across<br />\nthe street from Eddie's,<br />\nHomewood Deli, and the<br />\nHopkins Store.<br />\nThe building has several things<br />\nin its favor. It is close to campus<br />\n(10 minutes from Mudd, 6-8<br />\nfrom Gilman).

All units<br />\n<br />\nhave the basic amenities, but not<br />\ndishwashers, garbage disposals,<br />\nor air conditioning. The units<br />\nlook their age and show some<br />\nevidence of many paint jobs, but<br />\nare otherwise in reasonably good<br />\nrepair. Maintenance is usually<br />\nprompt, as in the day of your request, or the day after.<br />\nThe building contains a mix of<br />\nstudents, young to middle-aged<br />\npeople, and elderly residents.<br />\nThere are some problems, such<br />\nas some roach problems and<br />\nsome mice. The management<br />\nmakes an effort to deal with the<br />\nproblems through a regular exterminating service. This helps the<br />\nproblem, but it may not eliminate<br />\nit, especially if your neighbors<br />\ndon't ask for it in their units.<br />\nThe other problem some<br />\nstudents report is in getting along<br />\n<br />\nwith the apartment manager.<br />\nSome advice: don't have wild<br />\nparties, be courteous to her, and<br />\nshe will be courteous to you. As<br />\nlong as you and your guests treat<br />\nher with respect, you will not<br />\nhave problems.

But in September these<br />\nwill all be hidden as the completely renovated Wolman Hall opens.<br />\nThe new Wolman will boast<br />\nmany attractive amenities, including a food court, conference<br />\nrooms, social lounges, and a<br />\ngame room. The six residential<br />\nfloors will be divided into two<br />\nwings and rooms will be<br />\narranged in four-person suites.<br />\nWolman is organized in suites,<br />\nwith either two doubles or a double and two singles. Every room<br />\nwill have air conditioning and<br />\nheating control as well as carpet<br />\nand dorm-style furnishings. Each<br />\nsuite will also have a kitchenette,<br />\nthough this seems pretty unnecessary since all Wolman<br />\nresidents are required to be on a<br />\nmeal plan. The common area in<br />\neach wing of each floor will have<br />\na TV and a VCR.<br />\nSecurity appears to be a high<br />\npriority in the design of the<br />\nbuilding. While any student can<br />\nenter the food court and the<br />\ndownstairs, entrance to the<br />\nresidential floors requires a<br />\nspecial card which is passed<br />\nthrough a reader. Each wing also<br />\nhas its own entrance lobby which<br />\nrequires card access. From the<br />\nentrance lobby, students can take<br />\nan elevator to their floor but need<br />\n<br />\nto pass their card through another<br />\nreader to gain access to the floor<br />\nitself. Finally, a monitor will be<br />\non hand to admit non-residents<br />\nand to keep out \"undesirables.\"<br />\nWolman does have some disadvantages. Rooms appear to be on<br />\nthe small side and bathrooms are<br />\ndownright tiny.

And of course, it's right<br />\nacross the street from the St. Paul<br />\nshops.<br />\nWolman is ideal for those who<br />\nthrived in the dorm environment.<br />\nOther pluses are that it's brand<br />\nnew,(and thus pest-free), secure,<br />\nand furnished. And the location<br />\nsimply cannot be beat.

When they were<br />\nfirst installed, they had a tendency to break down, usually once<br />\na week and always on a Friday<br />\nnight, which again meant that<br />\nmaintenance would not notice until Monday morning. It is really<br />\n<br />\nThe units at the Baltimorean<br />\nare basically all large, furnished<br />\napartments and efficiencies. The<br />\napartments are very spacious with<br />\nfour rooms: a bedroom (with a<br />\npull-out couch), kitchen,<br />\nbathroom, and one other room<br />\nbetween the bedroom and<br />\nbathroom. The units cost about<br />\n$500 per month (on an elevenmonth lease); utilities (electricity, water, and gas) are included<br />\nin the rent but no air conditioning is available. Nine or twelvemonth leases can be obtained<br />\nThe building itself is old and<br />\nsome of the furnishings, notably,<br />\nthe oven and refrigerator, show<br />\ntheir age. Leaking pipes and<br />\nresulting water damage to the<br />\npaint and walls, is. an occasional<br />\nproblem. Even without the leaks,<br />\nmuch of the paint is cracking on<br />\nits own. With the exception of requests to have walls repainted<br />\n(due to cracking), maintenance<br />\nusually responds within a day or<br />\ntwo.<br />\nBugs are a problem, at least<br />\nduring the fall semester. While<br />\nthe University sent exterminators<br />\ntwice, it was not until after winter<br />\n<br />\nfun to walk seven flights of stairs<br />\nseveral times a day.<br />\nLaundry also becomes a real<br />\nadventure. The first time I did my<br />\nlaundry in this building, the<br />\nmachine got stuck in spin and<br />\nsudsed for over an hour before I<br />\nrealized and finally took my<br />\nclothes out and rewashed them.<br />\nMy apartment happens to have<br />\nthree separate phone lines<br />\nbecause Hopkins decided to wire<br />\neach individual room separately,<br />\nwhich left the students with the<br />\nextremely high cost of tying each<br />\nroom together. How silly of us to<br />\nassume hooking up one line<br />\nwould suffice for the entire<br />\napartment.<br />\nThese problems seemed<br />\nnegligible, though, initially. It<br />\nwas not until the great flood of<br />\n'90 that I really began to regret<br />\nmy move into the luxurious Bradford. My (wet and damp) apartment was one of the lucky chosen<br />\nfew to have new carpeting, which<br />\nmeant living with soggy,<br />\nmarshlike carpet for a week,<br />\nfollowed by plywood for several<br />\nmore weeks, until finally,<br />\nsometime late in October, the<br />\n<br />\n0110MOVRN<br />\n<br />\nBradford<br />\npromised plush carpeting was installed. We managed to survive<br />\nthis, and Housing was even<br />\ngracious enough to offer to pay<br />\nour first month's utilities (how<br />\ngenerous!).<br />\nThat seemed fair enough, yet<br />\nit is now February, and we have<br />\n<br />\nElisse Takara<br />\n<br />\nreceived two cutoff notices, for<br />\nHopkins has not yet paid<br />\nBaltimore Gas & Electric for our<br />\nSeptember utility bill.

Second is location: perched on the corner of<br />\nCharles and 31st Sts., the<br />\nbuilding is close to campus but<br />\nisolated from a lot of the chaos<br />\nof 33rd St. Third is maintenance:<br />\nQuick to respond and more<br />\nthorough than you would ever expect from an institutional labor<br />\npool, the University maintenance<br />\ncrew does a friendly and<br />\nworkmanlike job.<br />\nThat's the good side of things;<br />\nwhat about the bad? Well, apartments come unfurnished, the<br />\nHomewood deals in 12-month<br />\nleases only, and prices tend to be<br />\nhigher than at other locations,<br />\nespecially non-University dwellings. Rents for 1990-91 were: for<br />\nan efficiency, $390 per month;<br />\nfor a one-bedroom shared by two<br />\npeople, $217.50 per month per<br />\nperson; for a two-bedroom, $225<br />\nper month per person; for a threebedroom, $250 per month per<br />\nperson. All utilities and<br />\nmaintenance service are included, unless you operate an air conditioner, for which a nominal fee<br />\nis charged monthly. Rental prices<br />\nnext year will probably be from<br />\n8 to 10 percent higher.<br />\nThe front of this gigantic<br />\nbuilding faces the small, but<br />\ndecidedly verdant park across<br />\nCharles St. and also offers a nice<br />\nview of the Art Museum (Violins,<br />\nViolence, Silence). Those left<br />\nwith views of the rear can enjoy<br />\nthe everyday spectacle of<br />\nLovegrove Ave.: dumpsters,<br />\nhomeless people, weather beaten<br />\n<br />\nSt. Paul Court, conveniently<br />\nlocated across from Eddie's and<br />\nthe modest Charles Village<br />\nbusiness district, offers close and<br />\npleasant accomodations. A sortof Spanish design with a stucco<br />\nexterior, the building looks pretty damn neat.<br />\nThe apartments inside are<br />\nclean, well-kept, and repainted<br />\nbetween tenants. As an older<br />\nbuilding, the structure has been<br />\nrenovated over the years, and<br />\nsometimes that has resulted in<br />\noddly shaped apartments. Additionally, there is no single<br />\nfloorplan, but manager Cora<br />\nPrice Townes, will be happy to<br />\nshow you several different spaces<br />\nfor your needs.<br />\nThe rent is a variable. For an<br />\nindividual, it can be high\u2014as<br />\nmuch as $425 a month for a<br />\n\"junior\" (smaller than a one<br />\nbedroom). But a two bedroom,<br />\nwhich can comfortably accommodate four people, is around<br />\n$900 a month, more in line with<br />\nstudent budgets. The rent includes heat (which is controlled<br />\ncentrally), hot and cold water,<br />\nand trash removal (just put it out<br />\non the fire escape Mon., Wed.,<br />\nor Fri.)<br />\nThere are several advantages to<br />\nliving in St. Paul Court, including<br />\nthe eponymous courtyard, which<br />\nhas a gazebo, flower beds,<br />\nseveral benches, and a fountain<br />\nfor reading or relaxing in warmer<br />\nweather. The close proximity to<br />\ncampus is a plus, as is the quiet<br />\natmosphere. The office will accept large parcels and UPS<br />\npackages when you're not in.<br />\nThe tenants are a mix of<br />\nstudents, professionals, families,<br />\nand older people. Some students<br />\nhave expressed concern about not<br />\nbeing able to make enough noise<br />\n<br />\nThe Homewood<br />\ngarages, car stereo thieves, etc.<br />\nUnless you are planning a career<br />\nin anthropology or law enforcement, try to get a unit facing<br />\nCharles St.<br />\nInside, Homewood is friendly,<br />\nalthough a little spooky. Dark,<br />\naustere paneling gives the<br />\nhallways the appearance of<br />\nCatholic-school dormitories, and<br />\nthe introversion of many tenants<br />\nonly confirms suspicions that<br />\npeople have taken a vow of<br />\nsilence. (Except the numerous<br />\nchildren, who usually scream.)<br />\n<br />\nJ. Brendon Kruk<br />\n<br />\nThis is not such a surprising<br />\ndevelopment when one considers<br />\nhow many languages are spoken<br />\nwithin Homewood's walls, as the<br />\nbuilding houses numerous international students, especially<br />\ngraduates, many of whom live<br />\nthere with families. All tenants<br />\nseem to live with roaches,<br />\nalthough numbers and ARS<br />\n(average roach speed) varies<br />\nthroughout the year. Rodents,<br />\nhappily confine their social events<br />\nto the nearby alley.<br />\n<br />\nWhen<br />\nOur<br />\n<br />\n(the older tenants complain), but<br />\nit depends on who's immediately next door\u2014students tend not to<br />\ncomplain about each other.<br />\nProblems or things to be wary<br />\nof include security\u2014there is no<br />\nentry guard system or front desk<br />\nto keep an eye on things. And<br />\nalthough there are doorbells for<br />\neach apartment, they are just<br />\nrelics for a more decadent past.<br />\nBrass knockers, which are none<br />\ntoo loud, have to do in today's<br />\ndepressed times. Technology is<br />\nnot a big thing here: unlike the<br />\nCarlyle or the other high-rises,<br />\nthe apartments are not equipped<br />\nwith dishwashers or air<br />\n<br />\nconditioners<br />\nA laundry room is located in<br />\nthe basement, as are extra storage<br />\nfacilities. Another complaint concerns the heat. Although the<br />\nradiators give individual tenants<br />\na small degree of control (on or<br />\noff) the heat is also regulated centrally, which means it can easily<br />\nbe too hot or too cold.<br />\nThe expense, age, and security (or lack therof) are the big problems with St. Paul Court, but it's<br />\nfantastic location and quirkiness<br />\n(such as the courtyard) are very<br />\nattractive options.

There are no flat walls<br />\nor 90 degree angles; sound waves<br />\ntend to diffract randomly in different directions at sharp surfaces. The hall uses a series of 17<br />\nseven-foot convex plastic disks<br />\nsuspended above the stage to<br />\navoid uniform reflection or concentration of sound while<br />\nspreading the sound waves from<br />\nthe stage into the audience.<br />\nOver the orchestra seats, 52<br />\nconcert \"clouds,\" planar structures which help to collect the<br />\nsound waves missed by the disks,<br />\ndisperse sound into the ceiling.<br />\nThe ceiling then directs the sound<br />\ninto the audience in much the<br />\nsame way that a magnifying glass<br />\nfocuses sunlight.<br />\n<br />\nThe design of the Joseph<br />\nMeyerhoff Symphony Hall,<br />\nlocated at 1212 Cathedral Street<br />\nin downtown Baltimore, retains<br />\na traditional and elegant atmosphere while simultaneously<br />\nhousing finely tuned acoustics.<br />\nThe architecture of the<br />\nMeyerhoff is constructed to produce a \"dead sound,\" as described by the Manager of Administrations Barbara Kirstel. Usually,<br />\nsound waves are absorbed by<br />\nobstacles impeding their path.<br />\nWith dead sound, sound waves<br />\nflow around obstacles and continue moving without a break.<br />\nTo achieve this phenomenon,<br />\nthe Meyerhoff has a sweeping ar-<br />\n<br />\nThe ceiling slopes from 62 feet<br />\nhigh to around 44 feet above the<br />\nstage.

The Yankees own a tenyear television contract that will<br />\npay them 50 million dollars per<br />\nseason, while the Mariners' local<br />\nT.V. and radio contract contributes only 3 million to their<br />\ncoffers. Consequently, the Major<br />\nLeague should give a greater sum<br />\nof the network dollars to the<br />\nMariners, than to the Yankees<br />\n(preferably to the point where all<br />\n26 teams are relatively equal in<br />\ntheir T.V. revenues).<br />\nNevertheless, the 26 major<br />\nleague teams would still not be on<br />\nequal financial footing. Concessions, ticket sales, and merchandise figure heavily into each<br />\nteam's profits and are a reflection<br />\nof a team's success and failure.<br />\nRedistribution of these items<br />\nwould take away any incentive to<br />\nwin.<br />\nWhat is needed is the salary<br />\ncap, in which the size of payrolls<br />\nwould be tied to a percentage of<br />\nthe league's overall revenues.

The team has a season<br />\nrecord of three wins and two<br />\nlosses.<br />\nRuth Ochia said, \"Traditionally we lost to Navy, but this year<br />\nwe did better than expected. We<br />\nlost four of our matches with a<br />\n5-4 record. We were very close<br />\nto winning many of them and<br />\nmost of the other matches were<br />\nfairly close also.\"<br />\nCoach Gary Green agreed,<br />\n\"We lost by just one touch in four<br />\nof our matches and if we had won<br />\nthose, we would have won the<br />\nmatch. In that sense, it was a<br />\ndisappointing match for us.\"<br />\nHe added, \"We definitely<br />\nfenced better in this match than<br />\nin previous years which indicates<br />\nthe strength of the current team.<br />\nOur win-loss record is also one<br />\nof the best in recent years.\"<br />\nIn individual competition,<br />\nLaura Greenwald won three of<br />\nher four matches.

If<br />\nCornell loses their next air rifle<br />\nmatch, Hopkins will also advance<br />\nto the finals in the air rifle division. In that case, Hopkins would<br />\nface P.C.P.S. again for the championship. \"We can only hope,\"<br />\nsaid coach Sam Hardy. \"Considering where we started, it's<br />\nimpressive that we've come this<br />\nfar.\"<br />\n<br />\nBIA<br />\nNOTES<br />\nby Takashi Yokoyama<br />\n<br />\n\"P.C.P.S. beat us by only fifty or so points two weeks ago,\"<br />\nsaid freshman shooter Evan<br />\nBynum, \"so we decided that if<br />\nwe each improved our scores by<br />\nabout ten points, we'd have a<br />\nchance of beating them.\" Bynum<br />\nwent on to shoot his personal<br />\nbest, improving his previous<br />\nscore by 21 points.

The Lady<br />\nGreyhounds shot 64 percent from<br />\nthe field in the first half and seemingly converted every time down<br />\nthe floor thanks to a bevy of offensive rebounds. Moravian's excellent long-range shooting<br />\nspread the Hopkins defense,<br />\nleading to a number of offensive<br />\nboards. In addition, seven fouls<br />\nby Hopkins only midway through<br />\nthe half forced the Lady Jays to<br />\nback off in order to prevent<br />\nMoravian from going to the line<br />\nafter each foul.

Fieldson conceded<br />\nthat while Hopkins is not immune<br />\n,to these problems, he cited<br />\nRichardson's commitment to<br />\ngraduate students and his willingness to address graduate concerns. \"One of Hopkins' best<br />\nstrengtM is William Richardson,\" he said.<br />\nPhilip Hale, president of the<br />\nPeabody Students Association,<br />\nfor<br />\nRichardson<br />\nthanked<br />\n\"his commitment to the Peabody<br />\nConservatory, his fund-raising,<br />\nand creating a positive working<br />\nexperience.\" In addition, Hale<br />\npresented an autographed portrait<br />\nof concert pianist Arthur Rubenstein to Richardson.<br /><br />\nRepresenting the undergraduate body, President<br />\nBob Nelson of the Student Council was particularly impressed<br />\nwith Richardson's efforts to actively meet students, including<br />\nthe invitation of Orientation<br />\nleaders to his home for dinner and<br />\nhis attendance at Hopkins basketball games. Speaking about the<br />\nchanges that should be made in<br />\nthe future, Nelson said, \"I hope<br />\nthat the undergraduate students<br />\nhave more input on school affairs, anything from modifications of the curriculum, the Student Union, campus housing, and<br />\ngraduation requirements.\"<br />\nTwo other problems mentioned by Nelson were the expanded enrollment and the<br />\ndecrease of the faculty, as well as<br />\nsecurity on campus in terms of<br />\nlighting and the shuttle bus. At<br />\nthe end of his speech, he and<br />\nFieldson presented Richardson<br />\nwith a framed aerial photo of the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nTaking the podium, Richardson<br />\ndescribed a letter he had<br />\nreceived from two high school<br />\nstudents from Pennsylvania who<br />\nhad dropped by Hopkins unannounced, casually attending<br />\nclasses and talking to students. In<br />\ncomparison to three other<br />\nprestigious colleges they also<br />\nvisited, the students wrote that<br />\nthey were most impressed with<br />\nHopkins, according to Richardson. \"They found that they were<br />\nmuch more cordially greeted by<br />\nthe students here, and they saw<br />\nContinued on page 3<br /><br />\nThis Week\u2022<br />\nIt's been said that \"you<br />\ncan't go home again.\"<br />\nYou can, however, check<br />\nout our trusty Housing<br />\nGuide on p. 10 in<br />\nFeatures.<br /><br />\nEditorial continues the<br />\nepic saga of The Miranda<br />\nAct with a cheap alternative to regular housing,<br />\np. 4.<br /><br />\nSting sings, brings zing?<br />\nNews-Letter reviews The<br />\nSoul Cages in Arts page 7.<br /><br />\nThe Arts Calendar, now<br />\nback by popular demand.<br />\nAnd this time it's for real.<br />\nSee Arts, p. 8.<br /><br />\nDomination and swimming: the inside connection<br />\nand championship results<br />\nin Sports, p. 17.<br />\nThe new Meyerhoff<br />\nAuditorium\u2014an architectural diagram for you to<br />\nstudy and color.

Although the graduate students<br />\nwould teach under strict supervision of a faculty mentor, critics<br />\nsay that the fellowship program<br />\nruns contrary to Hopkins'<br />\nof<br />\ntradition<br />\nhonored<br />\nundergraduates being taught by<br />\nfull-time professors.<br />\nTeaching<br />\nThe. Dean's<br />\nFellowship Program is effective<br />\nfor the 1991-1992 academic year<br />\nand pays a salary of $5,000 per<br />\ncourse. Some professors say that<br />\nit cost-effectively provides more<br />\ncourse offerings which will ease<br />\nthe strain of current course<br />\noverenrollment.<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences Jacqueline Mitchell<br />\nstressed that the primary objective of the program is to provide<br />\nexceptionally qualified advanced<br />\ngraduate students with full<br />\nteaching experience, and to allow<br />\nundergraduates to learn from<br />\ntheir expertise.<br /><br />\n\"These graduate students will<br />\nbe the creme de la creme,\" Mitchell said. \"The graduate will<br />\nwork closely with and be<br />\nmonitored by their faculty mentor at all times, so the faculty will<br />\nthe<br />\nto<br />\nlinked<br />\nremain<br />\nundergraduates in turn.\"<br />\nJ.B. Schneewind, Professor<br />\nand Chair of the Department of<br />\nPhilosophy, said that his department's needs are such that its<br />\ncourses should only be taught by<br />\nfull-time faculty, and that the<br />\ntime-consuming fellowships may<br />\nslow down the graduate's doctoral work.<br />\n\"We also have a concern for<br />\nthe quality of undergraduate<br />\neducation,\" said Schneewind,<br />\n\"and the quality is best preserved by full-time faculty teaching<br />\nundergraduates.\"<br />\nArmstrong emphasized that the<br />\nfellowships will not replace fulltime faculty, and that the<br />\nfellowships will be awarded<br />\nprimarily on proven teaching<br />\nexcellence.<br />\n\"Graduate students will use<br />\nthis as their entree into university teaching,\" said Armstrong,<br />\n\"so they will work their hearts<br />\nout to make sure that they get<br />\ngood student reviews as \u2022vvell as<br />\ngood reviews by their faculty<br /><br />\nmentors.\"<br />\nArmstrong said that his student<br />\nadvisory committee, which is<br />\nmade up of 2 graduates and 7<br />\nundergraduates, generally approved of the program, but Craig<br />\nDubois, a junior and committee<br />\nmember, said:<br />\n\"It may provide a larger pool<br />\nof courses to choose from, but<br />\nundergraduates have mixed emotions because one expects to be<br />\ntaught by a Ph.D. at Hopkins.\"<br />\nRichard Goldthwaite, Chair of<br />\nthe Department of History, said<br />\nthat the fellowship is an imaginative way to relieve the<br />\nburden of overenrollment and that<br />\nfaculty-supervised graduates are<br />\nan excellent teaching resource.<br />\n\"There is a right to be concerned about a situation that could get<br />\nout of control if they [graduate<br />\nstudents] get exploited by a lot of<br /><br />\nteaching being turned over to<br />\nthem because of university finansaid<br />\nconstraints,\"<br />\ncial<br />\nGoldthwaite.<br />\nSome chairs have expressed interest in using the fellowship to<br />\noffer more sections of a course<br />\nthat is traditionally overenrolled.<br />\nMitchell said that she will not rule<br />\nout that possibility although it<br />\nruns contrary to the program's intent to create new courses.<br />\nRichard E. McCarty, chair of<br />\nthe Department of Biology,<br />\nspeculated that the science departments will have to use the<br />\nfellowship differently, and that<br />\nhis department may want to use<br />\nthis fellowship to offer more lab<br />\nsections of an overloaded core<br />\ncourse.<br />\n\"The idea doesn't mesh as well<br />\nas it could with Biology,\"<br />\nContinued on page 2<br /><br />\nHitchens Labels U.S.<br />\nPolicy As Imperialist<br />\nby Martin Stemmler<br />\n\"The United States policy has<br />\nalways been one of divide and<br />\nrule,\" said columnist Christopher<br />\nHitchens of The Nation in a talk<br />\non the current crisis in the Middle East last Friday. \"Divide et<br />\nimpera, the playing off of one<br />\nagainst another, and both ends<br />\nagainst the middle.\"<br />\nHitchens' column \"The<br />\nMinority Report\" appears twice<br />\na month in The Nation, a wellknown leftist weekly journal. Invited to speak in the Garrett<br />\nRoom of the MSE library by the<br />\nMiddle Eastern Students Association and the Graduate Students for<br />\nSocial Responsibility, Hitchens<br />\noffered his own analysis of the<br />\nhistory of the Gulf region leading<br />\nup to the present war and of the<br />\npolicy goals of the U.S. for the<br />\nregion.<br />\nHitchens repeatedly emphasized that he was \"neither a conspiracy theorist nor paranoid,\" in<br />\narguing the case that the U.S.<br />\npolicy is tantamount to imperialism, noting with care his<br />\nsources of information on which<br />\nhe based his views. While<br />\narguably taking the position of a<br />\ndispassionate observer, he<br />\nnevertheless availed himopportuniself of the<br />\nty to make sardonic remarks and<br />\nquips about the past four United<br />\nStates presidents and their administrations, much to the delight<br />\nof the audience.<br />\nSome in the audience,<br />\nhowever, were visibly shocked<br />\nwhen Hitchens reserved his<br />\nharshest criticism for the leaders<br />\nof the peace movement, calling<br />\ntheir alleged concern about the<br />\npotential for U.S. casualties<br />\nmoronic and naive. The audience<br />\nwas composed mainly of war protesters, many of whom were<br />\nmiddle-aged. A lengthy question<br />\nand answer session, punctuated<br />\nby disruptions by supporters of<br />\nextremist Lyndon Larouche,<br />\nfollowed the talk in which Hit-<br /><br />\nchens discussed his differences<br />\nwith members of the peace<br />\nmovement.<br />\n\"One of the unresolved consequences of inheritance of British<br />\ncolonial rule in the area has been,<br />\nof course, the unresolved question of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border,\"<br />\nsaid Hitchens in beginning his<br />\nanalysis of the history of the<br />\nconflict.<br />\nThe border was drawn up by an<br />\nIndian civil servant in the employ<br />\nof the British Colonial Office in<br />\n1922, according to Hitchens. The<br />\ndesign was \"to deny the<br />\nMesopotamian mandate [its1 access to the sea.\"<br />\n\"This decision was backed up<br />\nby two reinforcements: First, the<br />\nselection of a king, always a<br />\ntricky job when governing a Middle Eastern country. [Second],<br />\nbecause troops were scarce after<br />\nthe first World War, it was decided that the only way to govern<br />\n[Iraq] was by imposing rule from<br />\nthe sky, another tricky business.\"<br />\nHitchens said that he wondered<br />\nContinued on page 2<br /><br />\nJ Brendon Kruk<br /><br />\nMark Miller, a professor in the Department of Writing Seminars.<br /><br />\nPropaganda Plagues<br />\nCoverage in Gulf<br /><br />\nreporters played during the eight<br />\nlong years we roomed with Saddam Hussein.

More recently, there<br />\nwere students who objected to the<br /><br />\nthree-day closing of the Hutzler<br />\nLibrary for the celebration of his<br />\ninstallation. After receiving many<br />\npetitions, Richardson reduced the<br />\nclosing time from midnight<br />\nThursday to Saturday morning.<br />\nRichardson then opened the<br />\nfloor to discussion, taking questions from the audience. Asked<br />\nhow he would insure that minority students would be adequately<br />\nrepresented without quotas, he<br />\nsaid that it was necessary to try<br />\nto maintain a balance by looking<br />\nat incoming classes in terms of<br />\ndeveloping a diverse class rather<br />\nthan quotas. He also stressed effective recruitment to bring these<br />\nstudents to Hopkins.<br />\nRichardson also stated his intention to rebuild the French<br />\nDepartment, and described the<br />\n\"raid\" staged by Emory University to lure prominent professors.<br />\n\"It was very clever. I must give<br />\nthem credit for that. They received a $105 million endowment, and similar to the process<br />\nof building a baseball team, went<br />\nout and used the money to attract<br />\nprofessors from Hopkins,<br />\nPrinceton, the University of<br />\nMichigan, and other Universities,\" he said. However,<br />\nRichardson said that the<br />\nmagnitude of the incident was<br />\nblown out of proportion, most<br />\nnotably by the Atlanta Constitution. \"We need to put that behind<br />\nus and invest today. The dollars<br />\nare there, commitments have<br />\nbeen made, and I am confident<br />\nthat the French Department will<br />\nbe restored to its former level, if<br />\nnot higher,\" he said.<br /><br />\nDefending Dean Armstrong's<br />\ndecision to reserve 20 positions<br />\nfor graduate students to teach fulltime, Richardson said it was more<br />\naffordable, and these students,<br />\nmany of whom would be on the<br />\nverge of becoming faculty<br />\nmembers, are extremely<br />\nknowledgeable in their respective<br />\nfields.<br />\nAn audience of a hundred attended the convocation, and<br />\ndespite the relatively low turnout,<br />\nRichardson said that he was still<br />\nencouraged by the student participation.

But not<br />\nDoris.<br />\nMiranda had been Doris'<br />\nroommate since freshman year in<br />\nthe dorms.

Oddly<br />\nContinued on page 5<br /><br />\nShoveling through the Mail<br />\nThrough the years, and particularly during this year, the NewsLetter has received hundreds of thoughtful, often provocative letters. Their missions are various: some take a stand on campus issues;<br />\nsome respond to opinion pieces or other letters; some warn of growing conspiracies in American politics; and others, rare though they<br />\nare, take the News-Letter to task for its journalistic practices. The<br />\nNews-Letter reads this last group with intense interest and sincere<br />\nconcern. Like most publications, we rely upon our readers to bring<br />\nthings to our attention that slip through editorial cracks: evidence<br />\nof racism or sexism, misquotes or incorrect attribution of quotes,<br />\neditorializing in stories, pertinent isues that repeatedly fail to receive<br />\ncoverage in our pages\u2014the list is potentially infinite. Although errors inevitably do wriggle their way into each issue, the News-Letter<br />\ntries assiduously each week to publish a paper that fairly represents<br />\nboth life at Johns Hopkins and the concerns of the Hopkins Community. Thus we are grateful for these corrections and clarifications;<br />\nthey remind us that every story has unexplored angles, issues that<br />\ndo not automatically float to the surface.<br />\nSometimes, however, the News-Letter hears from readers who have<br />\nmore sweeping accusations to make. Their letters might accuse us<br />\nof doing damage to the University's reputation\u2014or perhaps to an individual's\u2014or of intentionally burying stories that the Hopkins Community has a right to know about. These are seious accusations, stabs<br />\nthat call into question everything that the News-Letter requires to<br />\noperate successfully\u2014the trust of its readers and the belief that the<br />\npaper serves an important function. Recently, three such complaints<br />\nhave been leveled at the News-Letter, two in letters to the editors<br />\nand one in a commentary printed in the Hopkins Spectator. Each<br />\ndeserves a response.<br />\n'Misquoting'\u2014In the February 15 issue of the News-Letter, there<br />\nappeared a letter to the editors by Craig Freeman, who accused staff<br />\nreporter Harry Milling of \"severely misquoting\" him in a February<br />\n8 article about Phi Mu's opportunity to move into Rogers House.<br />\nThe quotation at issue was Freeman's statement that some administrators believed that \"a fraternity's occupation of Rogers House<br />\nmight not 'run as smoothly' as a sorority's occupation might.\" This,<br />\nFreeman said, \"inferred [implied] that administrators felt that fraternities would not adhere to University regulations. . ..\" Freeman went<br />\non to \"caution both Mr. Milling and the News-Letter against misquoting interviewees in order to add validity to a specific writer's<br />\nopinion. As journalists it is your responsibility to present the facts<br />\nFirst, and most important, the News-Letter has never knowingly<br />\nfabricated or distorted facts or quotations within an article. Milling<br />\ninterviewed Freeman three times for the Phi Mu article; during the<br />\nsecond of these, he confirmed the quotation that Freeman disavowed in his letter. In light of this, Freeman's accusations\u2014that Milling misquoted him and that he did so to support his own view of<br />\nthe fraternityissue\u2014seem particularly out of place. The News-Letter<br />\nstands by Milling's article as fair and correct in its entirety.<br />\n'Deliberate Ambiguity'\u2014The February 1991 issue of the Hopkins<br />\nSpectator contained an intriguing reference to News-Letter turpitude.<br />\nThe item appeared in the magazine's Editors' Letter, which discussed<br />\nthe Uniersity's need for a \"conservative voice of dissent\" as well<br />\nas its overall state of decay. The editors alluded to the University's<br />\nrecent shuffling of faculty in departments throughout the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences\u2014the product of much backroom academic and<br />\nbudgetary wrangling\u2014and decried the News-Letter's two recent articles on the subject as \"deliberately ambiguous.\"<br />\nThere are two possible criticisms here: 1)that the News-Letter was<br />\ncovering up dirty secrets to help out the administration; 2) that the<br />\nissue simply didn't interest the News-Letter enough to elicit good news<br />\ncoverage. Both implications are false. Even the idea that the News-<br /><br />\nLetter was working to protect administrative interests, particularly<br />\nwhen the issue directly affects students and faculty\u2014is pretty close<br />\nto hilarious. Staff reporters for our paper consistently have trouble<br />\ngetting interviews with high-level administrators, and even more difficulty obtaining quotations for the record, because the paper is<br />\nperceived as anti-administration. When the suits in Garland want to<br />\nbury a story, as a rule, they just keep away from the News-Letter,<br />\nhoping that the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed accounts of University prosperity in the Gazette will deflect the attention of prospective and<br />\ncurrent students alike.<br />\nTo the second implication posed in the Spectator\u2014that the story<br />\nwasn't considered important by News-Letter editors\u2014we plead not<br />\nguilty. The News-Letter spent over a month collecting data and holding<br />\ninterviews with faculty members to flush out the details of the topsecret numbers involved in the Armstrong-Richardson faculty plan.<br />\nWe were refused access to any detailed summary of the changes within<br />\nArts and Sciences departments; as aresult, we attempted to build our<br />\nown by interviewing the head of every department affected by the<br />\nchange. Although some of the interviewees were candid about the<br />\nmeasures, many refused comment and others simply failed to return<br />\nrepeated phone calls. In the end, the data we assembled was not<br />\nsubstantial enough to present a complete\u2014and, we felt, honest\u2014<br />\npicture of the numbers involved. The articles that resulted reflected<br />\nthis omission, but they also gave a sense of how several department<br />\nheads were reacting to sharp alterations in departmental budgets. We<br />\nencourage the Spectator to publish a full set of figures regarding the<br />\nchanges if it has access to them\u2014this would be a tremendous service to the Hopkins Community.<br />\nBlame not the criminals, but the News-Letter\u2014In a letter to the<br />\neditor this week, Director of Security Major Robert Larkin makes<br />\naccusations that, while simple on the surface, suggest an ominous<br />\nundercurrent. Not surprisingly, the majority of these are directed at<br />\nthe News-Letter, which has been dogged in its criticism of Hopkins<br />\nSecurity this year. Responding to an editorial last week that pointed<br />\nout Security's lapse in preparing the Community Crime Report\u2014a<br />\ndocument that keeps track of off-campus crimes committed against<br />\nHopkins students\u2014Larkin charged that the News-Letter \"has regularly<br />\nfailed to pick up the [Community Crime Report] as they did in the<br />\npast.\" Larkin also blames the News-Letter for community ignorance<br />\nabout the Hopkins Escort Van service. \"I have never read in the<br />\nNewsletter [sic] about [the vans],\" he wrote, adding that the paper<br />\nalso \"would not print an escort poster we requested to be printed.\"<br />\nLarkin's memory lapse is puzzling. Despite his assertions, the Community Crime Report was first compiled for the News-Letter last fall,<br />\nin response to an editorial asking for realistic statistics about crimes<br />\ncommitted off-campus. The only crime report Security had produced regularly in the past is the functional but tedious Campus Crime<br />\nReport, a collection of incidents mainly involving thefts from desk<br />\ndrawers and from gym lockers in the Athletic Center. This data is<br />\nnot irrelevant, but it is far less important than the Community Crime<br />\nReport. If Larkin were as committed to student safety and awareness<br />\nas he claims to be, he would resume its compilation immediately.<br />\nLarkin's accusation that the News-Letter refused to print an escort<br />\nposter is a half-truth. What Larkin was requesting, in effect, was<br />\nfree advertising space over an indefinite period of time\u2014a privilege<br />\nregularly asked of the News-Letter by dozens of other campus<br />\norganizations. What the News-Letter offered to do was to run notices<br />\nabout the escort service, as well as any other relevant Security data,<br />\nalong with the Community Crime Report\u2014which, as mentioned<br />\nbefore, has not been released once this semester. Larkin has a standing forum in the News-Letter in which to present any information<br />\nhe feels important to the safety of the Hopkins Community. The NewsLetter provided that space; we did not take it away.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nSecurity Reiterates Its Ralson d'Etre<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe in Security have a genuine<br />\nconcern 'for the students at the<br />\nHomewood Campus. For this reason<br />\nI must respond to your \"Opinion\"<br />\nof February 15, 1991.<br />\nThe Security Bulletin notifying<br />\neveryone of the rape was printed on<br />\nMonday, February 11, the day after<br />\nthe rape. We had 3000 distributed to<br />\npost office boxes, all departments<br />\nand as many other area as we could<br />\nnotify, on Tuesday, February 12,<br />\n1991. The bulletin was accurate,<br />\ngiven the information with which we<br />\nhad to work.

This year the News-Letter has<br />\nregularly failed to pick it up as they<br />\ndid in the past. Several weeks of<br />\ncrime reports assembled just for the<br />\nNews-Letter are still laying in the<br />\nbasket for them.<br />\nYou will note that the Security<br />\nBulletin was #46. We post them as<br />\noften as needed. Most are to inform<br />\nthe public of potential crime hazards<br />\nbefore crime occurs. A few are<br />\npublished after the fact so that the<br />\nCommunity is well informed.<br />\nI have never read in the NewsLetter about the three (3) Security<br />\nEscort Vans we operate year round<br />\nfrom 5:00 p.m. till 3:00 a.m. We<br />\ntransported almost 60,000 students<br />\nduring last year. The News-Letter<br />\nwould not print an escort poster we<br />\nrequested to be printed. We have<br />\nconducted security meetings but few<br />\npesons attend.

Larkin<br />\nDirector, Homewood Security<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe author of Security Bulletin<br />\n#46 ended the February 1 1 th<br />\n\"Crime Alert\" concerning a recent<br />\nrape on campus by stating, \"All<br />\ncrimes cannot be prevented, but<br />\nmany by practicing safety precautions can be averted.\"<br />\nWhat is the point of this? Does<br />\nSecurity want the woman who was<br />\nraped to read this and to feel foolish<br />\nand guilty?

Incinerators are<br />\nsome of the greatest contaminators of our air, having been<br />\ncited for mercury, lead, and hundreds of other known toxins, yet<br />\nthe Clean Air Act, in sections 306<br />\nand 307, issues 30 years permits<br />\nto these incinerators instead of the<br />\nprevious 5 year permits and<br />\nreclassifies incinerator ash from<br />\n\"toxic\" to \"special waste.\"<br />\n\"Special waste\" is not as strongly regualated as \"toxic waste,\"<br />\nand may be disposed of without<br />\nEPA restrictions. This is an example of a similar problem in<br />\nwhich the costs are absorbed by<br />\na small group of people without<br />\npolitical power. Thus the costs<br />\nthey bear are not considered in<br />\neconomic feasibility studies.<br />\nThe Christian Science Monitor<br />\nhas reported that starting last<br />\nmonth a garbage dumping company will be paying the Lakota<br />\nSioux less than a dollar a ton to<br />\ndump garbage on their reservation land. (Hopkins pays $65 a<br />\nton to have our garbage incinerated or dumped into a landfill.) On the reservation the dumping company is exempt from<br />\nstrong state regulations and<br />\nanswers only to weak federal<br />\nstandards.<br /><br />\nIndustries refuse to stop<br />\npolluting because they say that the<br />\ncost would be prohibitive. Solar<br />\npower and other renewable<br />\nresources are not encouraged<br />\nbecause the market supposedly<br />\nwould be unable to support them.<br />\nThe California referendum Big<br />\nGreen was defeated because opponents successfully convinced<br />\nenough people that saving the environment would destroy the<br />\neconomy. Many environmental<br />\nconcerns are ignored in the name<br />\nof a growing economy, but more<br />\noften than not the environmentally sound methods are more<br />\neconomical than the methods proposed in the name of the<br />\neconomy.<br />\nPart of the problem is that certain shared costs are not factored<br />\ninto cost analyses. If an industry<br />\ncan spread some of its costs<br />\nacross the population, it won't<br />\nfactor those costs into an<br />\neconomic plan. Pollution is a<br />\nclassic example of this \"problem<br />\nof the commons.\" The Clean Air<br />\nAct of 1990 was almost defeated<br />\nbecause of Midwestern coalburning companies that didn't<br />\nwant to pay for pollution controls.<br />\nUnfortunately, acid rain caused<br />\nby the burning coal does not<br />\ndirectly cost these industries<br />\nmoney. The cost of the acid rain<br />\nis scattered across the NorthEastern United States and SouthEastern Canada. When one factors in the costs of lost farm production, lost fish production, property damage, and the cost in<br />\nhuman health and lives, the costs<br />\nbecome enormous.

In 1980, in the name<br />\nof the free market, the Reagan administration cut 90 percent of the<br />\nsubsidies given to energy companies to research solar power.<br />\nWithout these subsidies, solar<br />\nenergy research and development<br />\nnearly stopped. On the other<br />\nhand, fossil fuels and nuclear<br />\npower are well subsidized. The<br />\nconstruction and dismantling of<br />\nnuclear power plants is subsidized 30-40 percent. Subsidies for<br />\nnuclear power have been in place<br />\nsince the Price-Anderson Act of<br />\n1957, which limits the liability of<br />\nelectric utility companies for<br />\nnuclear accidents to $7<br />\nbillion.The Chernobyl accident<br /><br />\nhas cost $14 billion so far in<br />\ndirect cleanup costs. This price<br />\ndoes not include the medical costs<br />\nor the costs in lost lives and lost<br />\ncrops. Imagine if the Kansas<br />\nfarmland was destroyed by a<br />\nnuclear accident. This is the size<br />\nand scope of Chernobyl. Fossil<br />\nfuels also have many hiddent<br />\ncosts, including the Greenhouse<br />\nEffect, which seems so distant<br />\nand so widespread that very few<br />\npeople realize that the cost will<br />\nbe factored into their own lives.<br />\nOne way to bring out the hidden costs is \"green taxes,\" taxes<br />\nlevied against strategies that are<br />\nnot environmentally sound. This<br />\nmoney would then be used to<br />\ncover the costs to society.

Simon and<br />\nMazursky also teamed up on last<br />\nyear's outstanding Enemies, A<br />\nLove Story. Apparently, they've<br />\nbeen living on creative meat<br />\nscraps ever since.<br />\nEnemies is a thoughtful,<br />\nspirited film filled with<br />\ncherishable moments. Scenes<br />\nFrom a Mall is just the opposite.<br />\nBland and charmless, Mazursky's<br />\nlatest makes running up the down<br />\nescalator at Owings Mills look<br />\nlike the most exciting afternoon<br />\nimaginable.<br />\nAllen is Los Angeles sports<br />\nagent Nick Fifer, celebrating his<br />\nsixteenth wedding anniversary to<br />\nsuccessful pop psychologist<br />\nDeborah (Midler). After sending<br /><br />\nthe kids off to a weekend retreat,<br />\nthey bubble bathe together and<br />\nplan a celebratory dinner party,<br />\nonly occasionally interrupted by<br />\nbusiness calls on their separate<br />\nphone lines.<br />\nWhat busy, uninteresting lives<br />\nthey lead! Aside from the rather<br />\nnauseating concept of Midler and<br />\nAllen making love, these opening<br />\nscenes are lengthy and unrevealing. The actors work well<br />\ntogether, a natural ease evident in<br />\nthe banter, but the exchanges are<br />\nso boring that it makes little difference. Is this what we have to<br />\nlook forward to in marriage?<br />\nMazursky and Simon establish<br />\nthe couple's relationship with<br />\nsuch a minimum of enthusiasm<br />\nthat one is hard pressed to care.<br />\nNick and Deborah are people you<br />\nwouldn't want as parents,<br />\nspouses, friends, or even pets.<br />\nYou'd invite them to dinner when<br />\nyour first choice got the flu.<br />\nNick and Deborah decide to<br />\nspend their special day at a mall<br />\nin Beverly Hills, exchanging gifts<br />\nand buying sushi for the evening's feast. A romantic afternoon<br />\nturns sour when Nick admits he's<br />\nbeen having an affair for seven<br /><br />\nmonths. After heated discussions<br />\nand marital angst (translation:<br />\nMidler does that hysterical thing),<br />\nthey reach a temporary truce.<br />\nYet Deborah has some secrets<br />\nof her own, and later confesses<br />\na fling with a fellow psychiatrist.<br />\nRound two of marital hell<br />\nfollows, with Deborah and Nick<br />\nboth groping for answers in<br />\nanother frustrating verbal chase<br />\naround the shopping center. The<br />\nending is admirably unsettled<br />\n(especially for Touchstone Pictures, kings of the happy ending),<br />\nbut after enduring the rest of the<br />\nfilm, the audience deserves<br />\nbetter.<br />\nThe crisis takes place entirely<br />\nin the Beverly Hills mall, with<br />\nMazursky and Simon contriving<br />\nreason after reason for them to remain there. If you thought a shopping center was a dull setting,<br />\nyou're right. As if a collapsing<br />\nmarriage of two whiners weren't<br />\nmaddening enough, Mazursky's<br />\npresentation of the shopping mall<br />\nas late twentieth century cultural<br />\ncontext is downright suicideinducing.<br />\nMazursky and Simon aim<br />\nseveral gentle barbs at the L.A.<br /><br />\nlifestyles along the way\u2014the car<br />\nphones, the traffic, the inescapable, irritating facade of<br />\nhappiness\u2014but they fall far short<br />\nof the mark, Steve Martin's<br />\nlatest, L.A. Story, is a far more<br />\nprecise take on this hideous<br />\nAmerican subculture.<br />\nMuch of the problem is Allen.<br />\nPony-tailed and gussied up in<br />\ntrendy garb, he is unconvincing<br />\nfrom his first moments on screen.<br />\nWhen Allen has acted in the past,<br />\nhe's been far more effective playing himself\u2014on the opposite<br />\ncoast. It's a credit to his ability<br />\n(and historic lack of self-respect)<br />\nthat he makes it through the ninety minute film at all.<br />\nNick is forty years old, but<br />\nAllen looks like he hasn't been<br />\nthat young in forty years. Either<br />\nthe West coast sun has been playing wicked tricks on Nick's face,<br />\nor he has progeria, that rapid aging disease. You make the call.<br />\nIf the story were engaging, the<br />\ndialogue witty, or the setting<br />\nsomething other than a shopping<br />\ncenter, Scenes From a Mall might<br />\nbe worth watching. But it fails on<br />\nall three counts. Few films so effectively alienate their audience<br /><br />\nNick and Deborah Fifer (Woody Allen and Bette Midler) share their<br />\ninfidelities in Scenes From A Mall.<br /><br />\nfrom the story.<br />\nFilms about the complexities of<br />\nlife are often the best films of all.<br />\nScenes From a Mall is out to give<br />\nlife a bad name.

Kern<br />\nHere's the scene: you stand at<br />\nthe edge of an expanse of<br />\nwater\u2014an ocean, a gigantic<br />\nemerald sea\u2014and in the distance<br />\nyou see an enormous ship, creeping along the horizon. Big boat,<br />\nyou think to yourself, awed at the<br />\nfigure it cuts against the sky. You<br />\nwonder if it might be a tanker,<br />\nwallowing under the weight of<br />\nmillions of gallons of oil, or a<br />\ncargo ship whose innards have<br />\nbeen stuffed with exotic goods for<br />\na long maritime voyage.<br />\nOne thing is certain: a ship that<br />\nbig must be carrying an important payload, something essential<br />\nto the welfare of humankind. Not<br />\nknowing why, you feel an<br />\nallegiance with it, and watch it<br />\nskim imperceptibly across the line<br />\nbetween sea and sky.<br />\nWhen the ship is gone\u2014out of<br />\nsight, the event concluded\u2014you<br />\nlook around to see how the world<br />\nhas changed. Nothing. Everything looks the same. The surface<br />\nof the water is vacant, the beach<br />\ndeserted, the wind still blows<br />\nthrough the whispering palms<br />\noverhead. The only thing different is the time: you've spent<br />\nan hour fixated on something that<br />\nhas disappeared without a trace.<br />\nThat, in short, describes the experience of listening to The Soul<br />\nCages, the latest album by Sting.<br />\nGrand in scope, impressively<br />\nconstructed, and laden with<br />\nimages of skylines and sailing,<br />\nthe fourth solo outing by the wellgroomed Gordon Sumner is a<br />\nrecord that sits stubbornly in anchor for almost all of its forty-five<br />\nminutes. As it plays, it sounds<br />\ncoherent, important, even<br /><br />\nmagical, but after the last song<br />\nfades the listener sits there stranded with a feeling of stuffed<br />\nhollowness\u2014the emotional<br />\nequivalent of a stomach full of<br />\ncheese puffs.<br />\nIt's a surprising result given the<br />\napparent depth of the album. The<br />\nSoul Cages is host to a plethora<br />\nof recurring images and allusions:<br />\nfatherhood, death, the sea, ships,<br />\nthe cleansing power of water, and<br />\nothers. It's a catalog with an<br />\nundeniable literary pedigree, rich<br />\nwith romantic associations of<br />\nhardship and courage, and Sting<br /><br />\nThe Soul Cages<br />\nfinds Sting in new<br />\nand often<br />\nridiculous form.<br />\ninjects them liberally into his<br />\nmaterial. \"The Wild Wild Sea\"<br />\nrecounts an episode in which the<br />\nnarrator one day sees a ship on<br />\nthe horizon that sporadically appears and disappears. That night,<br />\nwalking in his sleep, he imagines<br />\nthat he swims out to the ship,<br />\ndiscovers it stuck in irons, and<br />\nfalls asleep, only to wake as an<br />\nominous gale begins to toss the<br />\nvessel on the water.<br />\nFor the discerning listener who<br />\nasks, \"So what?\" Sting has a<br />\nready reply. Near the end of the<br />\nnarrative, our hero sees the<br />\n\"shade of a sailor/On the bridge<br />\nthrough the wheelhouse pane.\"<br />\nBut this isn't any ordinary ghost,<br />\nfor \"underneath the sailor's hat,\"<br /><br />\nhe reveals after a melodramatic<br />\npause, \"I saw my father's face.\"<br />\nIn the right hands, this fairly<br />\nconventional narrative could<br />\nperhaps survive a performance by<br />\na rock band. But Sting, with his<br />\nperennial love for the highfalutin, turns \"The Wild Wild<br />\nSea,\" like the majority of The<br />\nSoul Cages, into little more than<br />\na tawdry poolside poetry reading.<br />\nHe lingers wistfully over<br />\nsyllables, as if contemplating<br />\nissues of profound philosophical<br />\nimport, and delivers completely<br />\nmaudlin lines (\"All around me<br />\nwas silence/As if mocking my<br />\nfrail human hopes\") as if they<br />\nwere scripture\u2014or poetry, for<br />\nthat matter.<br />\nThough Sting has made no<br />\nsecret of his poetic aspirations<br />\nover the years (his last album,<br />\n...Nothing Like the Sun,took its<br />\ntitle from a Shakespearean sonnet), The Soul Cages finds him in<br />\nnew and often ridiculous form.<br />\nThe majority of songs here are<br />\nwritten in rigid meter, with accompanying rhyme schemes that<br />\nmight flow nicely if Sting weren't<br />\nso intent on letting the listener<br />\nknow\u2014by singing in halting<br />\nphrases\u2014how \"well structured\"<br />\nthey are.<br />\nHe has an affection for lofty<br />\nsounding words and phrases: people in these songs don't walk in<br />\ntheir sleep, but in their<br />\n\"slumber\"; there are no ghosts<br />\non this record, but \"shades.\"<br />\nGone is the subtlety that made<br />\nmany of the Police's albums so<br />\nengaging, and left in its place is<br />\nSting who, despite an occasional<br />\napt phrase, now merely acts as if<br />\nhis lyrics carry meaning. Despite<br />\nContinued on page 8<br /><br />\nby Paul Kramer<br />\nIf you've ever stayed up all<br />\nnight arguing if God is dead, if<br />\ndemocracy is really possible, or<br />\nif it's nature or nurture that makes<br />\nboys seem different from girls,<br />\nthen you need to get hold of a<br />\ncopy of A World of Ideas II. In<br />\nhis second volume, Bill Moyers<br />\ntakes on the biggest issues of our<br />\ntime with, not surprisingly, some<br />\nof the greatest thinkers of our<br />\ntime.<br />\nIn his introduction, Moyers<br />\ndescribes the history of<br />\ndemocracy as the history of a particular kind of conversation. In<br />\nearly America, the printing press<br />\nproduced a community whose<br />\ncentral feature was common<br />\nnews, and whose dialogues and<br />\ndebates, in taverns and public<br />\nsquares, allowed our young<br />\ndemocracy to work. The news<br />\nprovided the underlying social<br />\nfabric of the American public,<br />\nand the press's most important<br />\ntask was to take that public<br />\nseriously.<br />\nBut, according to Moyers, the<br />\nnature of that public has fundamentally changed. Americans no<br />\nlonger talk to each other about<br />\nideas, and in that silence, our<br />\npublic discourse and political<br />\nconsciousness have withered.<br />\nWhere our forefathers argued for<br />\nhours in the public greens, we are<br />\npacified by 9-second sound-bites<br />\nin front of the tube. We have<br />\nbecome spectators of our own<br />\ndemocracy, handing over control<br />\nto those politicians that entertain<br />\nus most, and keep us thinking the<br />\nleast.<br />\nThe situation is not without<br />\nhope, however. While our<br />\ntechnology has given us the tools<br />\nof our own lobotomization (i.e.<br />\nTV news), it has also given us<br />\nways to restart the energetic<br />\ndialogue that democracy requires<br />\n(i.e. publishing a new book). A<br />\nWorld ofIdeas H is the natural extension of this belief: 29 interviews with an eclectic mix of<br />\nthinkers, each of which brings his<br />\nown unique perspective to the<br />\nproblems we face as individuals<br />\nand as a society.<br />\nBill Moyers, whose name<br />\ncould follow the words \"this intellectual brought to you by,\"<br />\nshows himself to be one of the<br />\ngreat askers-of-questions here. As<br />\nin his thought-provoking interviews with mythologist Joseph<br />\nCampbell, Moyers displays a<br />\nremarkable capacity for cutting to<br />\nthe crucial issues, forcing his subjects into corners, confronting<br />\nthem with their contradictions,<br />\nand evoking their logic and<br />\nunderstanding. In the process,<br /><br />\neach subject's world-view is illuminated in all its complexity.<br />\nBut more impressive than<br />\nMoyers himself are the people he<br />\nis able to bring to us through<br />\nthese interviews. Their interests<br />\ncome from nearly every realm of<br />\nhuman existance, from political<br />\ndynamics to philosophies of art to<br />\ndeep matters of the spirit. They<br />\naren't scholarly bones hiding inside big and hollow language<br />\neither; these are people that are<br />\nable to articulate their ideas to the<br />\nreader with remarkable clarity<br />\nand wit. Have a chat with an<br />\nethics professor from the Wharton School of Business, or the<br /><br />\nBill Moyers takes on<br />\nthe biggest issues of<br />\nour time with the<br />\ngreatest thinkers of<br />\nour time<br />\ndiscoverer of the polio vaccine.<br />\nTalk to the lyrical poet working<br />\nto form a Men's Movement.<br />\nMeet the theatre director who set<br />\na production of Don Giovanni in<br />\nHarlem and a production of<br />\nShakespeare in a swimming pool.<br />\nA World ofIdeas II is a fun and<br />\nenlightening read, not because it<br />\ngives all the right answers, but<br />\nthat it asks some of the most<br />\nserious questions we face today.<br />\nHow are we to recapture the interest of citizens in a political<br />\nworld that no longer seems to respond to them? How are we to<br /><br />\nunderstand our identities in an increasingly multi-cultural environment? What ethical role does the<br />\nindividual play in a complex<br />\ntechnological world? While<br />\nphilosophical in nature, these are<br />\nalso the hottest political topics of<br />\nour time\u2014racial conflict, artistic<br />\ncensorship, abortion rights and<br />\nenvironmental concerns among<br />\nthem.<br />\nThese are issues you can find<br />\nin any national news magazine<br />\nevery week, painted there broadly<br />\nwith ideology and sarcasm. But<br />\nwhat makes this account different<br />\nis not only its clarity and intelligence, but its implicit call to<br />\naction. This is a book that gets<br />\nyou somewhere, that manages to<br />\nconvince you of the most central<br />\nof all democratic tenets: that you<br />\ncan make a difference.<br />\nWhile it could be argued that<br />\n29 broad opinions don't make \"a<br />\nworld of ideas,\" Moyers is<br />\ncareful never to claim they are.<br />\nRather, for him, these discussions<br />\nare a kind of intellectual jumpstart, the initial point of an even<br />\ngrander and more fruitful<br />\ndialogue. He isn't trying to sell<br />\nus on his subjects' books, or even<br />\non the ideas they espouse. He is<br />\ntrying to sell us on the idea of<br />\nhaving ideas in the first place.<br />\nAnd while A World of Ideas 11<br />\nmay not get hordes of citizens<br />\ndebating in the public squares, it<br />\nmay pull us from MTV long<br />\nenough to get us talking again. As<br />\nMoyers and his subjects make<br />\nvery clear, there's an awful lot to<br />\ntalk about.<br /><br />\nLL MOYERS<br />\nA WORLD<br />\n14,1wo<br />\nlsvis<br /><br />\nLv liroph<br />\nAlamo lifforw.<br /><br />\nOF IDEAS<br />\n}<br />\n,41, 11001 Vila<br /><br />\nAhrimat<br />\nM<br /><br />\nIt 1611t.t<br /><br />\nIbisares<br />\n*Onto riot,\" M.itut<br />\nrt, ft:4)4<br />\n10110144os<br /><br />\n8/FEBRUARY 22, 1991<br /><br />\nThe Artful Dodger<br />\nFILM<br />\nFor free movie location info,<br />\ncall 832-1200 (x2313)<br />\nReel World presents Immoral<br />\nTales, proving art can be sexy<br />\n(and sex arty), an artistic portrayal of sexuality across the ages<br />\n(Sun 2/24, 2:30 and 8 p.m., $2<br />\nstudents, $3 general)<br />\nThe NEH Film Series presents<br />\nUncovering the Past: Images of<br />\nAntiquity, 2/27 5:30 p.m.,<br />\nPCTB Auditorium.<br />\nThe Baltimore Film Forum<br />\npresents their last in a series of<br />\nAfrican films with Finzan, which<br />\nconcerns the struggle that two<br />\nwomen undergo to control their<br />\nown lives in the face of traditional<br />\nmale supremacy, 2/28 8 p.m.,<br />\nBMA, 889-1993.<br />\nOrpheum cinema presents a<br />\ndisturbing but powerful double<br />\nshot of Scorcese ending the 24th:<br />\nTaxi Driver(7:30 p.m., matinee<br />\n2 p.m.) and Raging Bull (9:30<br />\np.m., matinee 4 p.m.), double<br />\nfeature $4.50.<br />\nThe Senator Theatre presents<br />\nthe Baltimore premiere of He<br />\nSaid, She Said, filmed in<br />\nBaltimore, 1, 4, 7:30, 10 p.m..<br />\nOther local theaters: The<br />\nCharles 727-3456, Rotunda Twin<br />\nCinemas 235-1800, Movies at<br />\nHarbor Park 837-3500.<br />\nTHEATRE<br />\nFor free theatre info, call<br />\n832-1200 (x2320)<br />\nThis weekend, the Barnstormers perform A Midsummer<br />\nNight's Dream, Shakespeare's<br />\nfantastical comedy of lovers, in<br />\nthe Arellano Theater.

You'll be<br />\nthe better for it.<br /><br />\nContinued from page 7<br />\na wash of literary allusions, all<br />\nthat lingers is Sting's illusion that<br />\nthese lyrics are deep and<br />\nmeaningful.<br />\nFor all his shortcomings as a<br />\nlyricist, however, Sting has<br />\nalways been a strong composer.<br />\nDuring his tenure with the Police<br />\nand throughout his solo career, he<br />\nhas been a perpetual source of<br />\nrich melodies and harmonies, of<br />\nhooks that linger in the brain long<br />\nafter most Top 40 ear candy is<br />\nforgotten. His skill as an arranger, particularly on The<br />\nDream of the Blue Turtles, his<br />\nfirst<br />\nsolo<br />\nalbum,<br />\nwas<br />\nunimpeachable.<br />\nIt is no surprise, then, that The<br />\nSoul Cages contains some exceptional music. What is surprising<br />\nis how consistently Sting manages<br />\nto dilute it\u2014as well as the band<br />\nperforming it\u2014in a swarm of<br />\nelectronic effects. Apparently<br />\ntickled with the endless<br />\npossibilities of his Synclavier<br />\nsampling instrument, he has infested the album with a landscape<br />\nof hums and drones which give<br />\nthe impression that the band<br />\n(which includes such talents as<br />\nBranford Marsalis, Kenny<br />\nKirkland, and David Sanctious)<br />\nis either going to dissolve,<br />\nevaporate, or simply be<br />\nsmothered.<br />\nAnd if much of The Soul Cages<br />\nsounds friendly and familiar,<br />\nthere's a reason: several of the<br />\nhooks are cribbed from Police<br />\nrecords. \"Mad About You\" is a<br />\ncompendium of snippets from<br />\nSynchronicity and Ghost In the<br />\nMachine, while \"When the<br />\nAngels Fall\" lifts a slice of<br />\n\"Every Breath You Take\"<br />\npiecemeal.<br />\nIt's<br />\nSting's<br />\nprerogative to reuse his own<br />\nmaterial, of course, but the songs<br />\nthat result\u2014like recycled<br />\npaper\u2014seem dull and motheaten, despite their perfect sonic<br />\nsheen.<br />\nThe album isn't a total wash.<br />\nThe first track, \"Island of<br /><br />\nSouls,\" is a dreamy 6/4 dirge that<br />\nmovingly recounts the fantasies<br />\nof a young boy whose shipbuilding father is killed in an industrial accident. \"All This<br />\nTime,\" the record's first single,<br />\ntranscends its self-important<br />\nlyrics with a joyful, rippling<br />\nmelody and sharp drumming by<br />\nManu Katche. And \"Jeremiah<br />\nBlues (Part I)\" brings the album<br />\nas close to the boiling point as<br />\nSting is likely to get (that is to<br />\nsay, lukewarm), and gives the<br />\nrecord a much-needed dose of<br />\nbite.<br />\nThe norm for The Soul Cages,<br />\nhowever, is smooth, antiseptic<br />\nbackground music\u2014a blend that<br />\nwould sound utterly inhuman if<br />\nnot for Sting's often gargantuan<br />\nflights of pretentiousness at the<br />\nmicrophone. When he sings,<br />\nregrettably, he enunciates, pressing the syllables, heaving oxygen<br />\ninto the microphone until he<br />\nsounds almost abnormally mannered, as if he were John<br />\nHouseman reciting the lyrics of<br />\nDef Leppard.<br />\nIf all this sounds a bit extreme,<br />\nit is. The Soul Cages, like both<br />\nof the studio albums that preceded it, is yet another product of<br />\nSting's desire to make not merely records, but musical<br />\ndocuments of his thoughts and<br />\nfeelings. And though he has probably always loved the sound of<br />\nhis own voice, Sting's singing on<br />\nthis record threatens\u2014quite<br />\nliterally\u2014to overpower the<br />\ndwindling music behind it.<br />\nThis would be well and good<br />\nif the lyrics here weren't such a<br />\ntitanic disappointment. But ships<br />\nand sails and lost sailors' tales require a sharp ear for cliche and<br />\na good sense of humor, both of<br />\nwhich Sting lacks.

There are<br />\neven students who take apartments downtown and commute<br />\non the Peabody shuttle: they trade<br />\nthe awful inconvenience and high<br />\ncrime rate for an active offcampus life.

ASK. When you do,<br />\nyou'll discover that Hopkins<br />\nstudents love to talk about housing. They'll tell you about good<br />\nroommates, bad roommates, nice<br />\nlandlords, awful landlords, great<br />\napartments, scummy apartments.<br />\nWho knows why: it's probably<br />\nthe find-your-own nature of<br />\nHopkins housing combined with<br />\nthe slightly compulsive nature of<br />\nthe Hopkins student. Whatever<br />\nyour approach to finding a place<br />\nto live, though, make sure that<br />\nyou don't overlook this important<br />\nresource.<br />\nThat aside, there are a few<br />\nbasic principles and caveats that<br />\nanyone seaching for city housing<br />\nshould keep in mind. The area<br />\naround the Homewood campus<br />\nisn't a suburban paradise or a<br />\ntypical college town, it's an old<br />\nsection of a major city, and has<br />\nall the perils one might expect.<br />\nDon't take your safety for<br />\ngranted. When you're looking for<br />\napartments, check for grilles over<br />\nthe windows that can be reached<br />\nfrom street level. (Don't forget<br />\nfire escape windows.) Outside<br />\ndoors should have solid deadbolt<br />\nlocks; an intercom that allows<br />\nyou to screen your visitors is<br /><br />\nLife, liberty and the pursuit of housing<br />\npus. Probably the safest of large apartment buildings facing<br />\nHopkins neighborhoods; pro- the north edge of campus. Decepbably the dullest, too. Few tively close: they're near the camstudents live here, but those who pus, true, but residents have a<br />\ndo often love it. Easier to get a long walk to anything but the<br />\nwhole house for rent here than in lacrosse field.

Not much in<br />\nthe way of grocery shopping;<br />\nthink twice unless someone in<br />\nyour household has a car.<br />\nOther considerations should<br />\nenter into your choice of apartment as well. What's the space<br />\nitself like? Think about windows<br />\nwhich face morning sun or evening sun (or no sun at all, as my<br />\nold bedroom did). When you're<br />\ntouring an occupied apartment,<br />\nask what it's like to live there.<br />\nAre there overheated rooms and<br />\nicy rooms? Try out the plumbing:<br />\nturn on taps, flush toilets see if<br />\nthe hot water is hot. Are there<br />\nlaundry machines in the house, or<br />\nnearby? The Housing Office<br />\nkeeps a \"Rate Your Landlord\"<br />\nnotebook in which students can<br />\nwarn or reassure their peers. It's<br />\na useful document; refer to it, and<br />\nadd your own notes before you<br />\ngraduate.<br />\nBaltimore apartments are<br />\nmoderately priced: students from<br />\nNew York and Boston will find<br />\nbargains, while those from Des<br />\nMoines may be shocked at the<br />\nprices. Expect to spend<br />\nsomething like $300 per person<br />\nper month. When several people<br /><br />\nshare an apartment or house,<br />\nthey'll pay a little bit less; single<br />\napartments are somewhat more.<br />\nLarge apartment buildings may<br />\ninclude utilities in the rent, but<br />\nprivate houses often don't. The<br />\ndifference comes to several hundred dollars yearly; make sure to<br />\nfind out.<br />\nA final tip: while it sounds obvious, make sure you read your<br />\nlease before you sign it. It's<br />\namazing how many tenants and<br />\neven landlords don't even read<br />\nthe fine print. Some owners will<br />\npoint out specialized clauses;<br />\nsome won't. Musicians should<br />\nnote that the hours during which<br />\nthey can practice are often<br />\nregulated.<br />\nEach apartment in Baltimore is<br />\nunique, and somewhere out there<br />\nis the one for you. Think about<br />\nwhat you want and go find it. The<br />\n\"ideal\" apartment may be a<br />\nnightmare, and the apartment you<br />\nhave to settle for may turn into<br />\nheaven at Homewood. You can't<br />\npredict the future, so find<br />\nsomething you like and take your<br />\nchances; if worse comes to<br />\nworse, just live and learn.

Why live in a different zip code, you ask? Because<br />\nit is the Carlyle, and as such, you<br />\nget all the benefits of a renovated<br />\nhotel. Security is pretty tight with<br />\na doorman at the door 24 hours<br />\nof the day. The neighborhood is<br />\nterrific\u2014Roland Park, pretty<br />\nsuburban. The Rotunda Mall is a<br />\nscant 5 minutes away; translation:<br />\nhello, Giant supermarket!<br />\nPrices are a bit higher than<br />\nCharles Village, at about $850 for<br />\ndoubles and $650 for singles. The<br />\napartments are clean and spacious<br />\nwith few pest problems (though<br />\nthere have been some problems<br />\nwith roaches on the lower floors).<br />\nEach apartment includes a<br />\ndishwasher and a food disposal,<br />\nand all the fixtures are well maintained. There are washers and<br />\ndryers in the basement at $1.50<br /><br />\nA Carlyle apartment<br /><br />\nper load per machine as well as<br />\na dry cleaner and a Chinese<br />\nrestaurant on the first floor.<br />\nUtilities are not included in the<br />\nrent, but they usually don't go<br />\nover $40 a month for three people. There is air conditioning in<br />\nthe summer and heat in the<br />\nwinter, which is included in the<br />\nrent. The building is wired for<br />\ncable, has indoor parking ($40 a<br />\nmonth)and, of all things, a swimming pool on the roof.<br />\nThe management is in the<br />\nbuilding and seems fairly amiable<br />\ntowards students. Maintenance is<br />\nvery good, but takes about a day<br />\nto get around to problems.<br />\nRoughly one-third of the<br />\ntenants are students and one-third<br />\nare elderly. Some students feel<br />\nisolated from their friends in<br />\nCharles Village but the shuttle<br />\ndoes help.<br />\nOther than a complaint about<br />\nthe distance, the Carlyle is luxury at a reasonable price.<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nHopkins House, located on<br />\n39th St. and University next to<br />\nthe Carlyle, is a quiet,<br />\nmoderately priced option that is<br />\nideal for those who don't mind a<br />\nlittle bit of walking. The trek to<br />\nthe lower quad is upwards of fifteen minutes, but proximity to the<br />\nRotunda is a definite plus which<br />\nalmost makes up for the<br />\ninconvenience.<br />\nStudents comprise only about<br />\na third of all Hopkins House<br />\nresidents, so the atmosphere is<br />\nquite conducive to studying.<br />\nTenants include young families,<br />\nretirees, professors, and grad<br />\nstudents. Rent is $700/month for<br />\na 2 bedroom, $475/month for a<br />\nstudio, and $575/month for a 1<br />\nbedroom. Utilities are included,<br />\nand leases last for 1 year.<br />\nHopkins House has been under<br />\nnew management for the past<br />\nyear and a half, and some improvements are readily evident.<br />\nA special card system has been<br />\ninstituted for gaining access to the<br />\nbuilding, and during the hours<br />\nwhen no one is. stationed at the<br />\nfront desk, a security guard is<br />\nposted. Despite these measures,<br />\nthere were a few burglaries in the<br />\nfall, but these no longer seem to<br />\nbe a problem.<br /><br />\nMaintenance is quick, but not<br />\nnecessarily effective. Also, a<br />\nroach problem has surfaced in the<br />\nlast few months. Management is<br />\ngenerally not overly responsive to<br />\nstudents' concerns, but few<br />\nstudents find this to be a major<br />\ndilemma.<br />\nHopkins House apartments are<br />\ngenerally spacious and in fairly<br />\ngood condition\u2014they are<br />\nequipped with air conditioning<br />\n(but little heat), dishwashers, and<br />\ngarbage disposals. Extras include<br />\na pool, the overpriced but exdeli<br />\nconvenient<br />\ntremely<br />\ndownstairs, and balconies off of<br />\nevery apartment (which unfortunately attract more than their<br />\nfair share of pigeons). Parking<br />\nprivileges in the garage and<br />\nmembership in the health club or<br />\ntanning salon are available for an<br />\nextra fee.<br />\nFor the student who doesn't<br />\nmind a lot of exercise and a certain degree of isolation from the<br />\nHopkins community, Hopkins<br />\nHouse should definitely be a consideration. Certainly the apartments could be better maintained, but their condition is far<br />\nfrom deplorable, and on a student's budget, probably not much<br />\nbetter is to be found in the area.<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nThe Mayfair<br /><br />\nThe Mayfair<br />\nIf you are looking for a convenient place to live, consider the<br />\nMayfair apartments. Located between Wawa and PizzApeel, the<br />\nMayfair offers proximity to both<br />\nCharles Village and the campus.<br />\nThere are nine apartments which<br />\ncan comfortably house up to four<br />\npeople (two singles and a double)<br />\nfor only $860 a month. This price<br /><br />\nDziugas Radzius<br /><br />\ndoes not include electricity and<br />\ngas (for the oven), while heat and<br />\nwater are included.<br />\nThe rooms are quite spacious<br />\ncompared to other housing,<br />\nalthough they are a bit run down.<br />\nOften noticeable are peeling<br />\npaint, particularly on the windows of rooms and kitchens. The<br />\nMayfair, like other buildings in<br /><br />\nthe area, also has its problems<br />\nwith mice and roaches although<br />\nthe more sanitary you keep your<br />\napartment, the fewer problems<br />\nyou'll have.<br />\nProblems with noise are expected when you are situated on<br />\n33rd Street between Charles and<br />\nSt. Paul. The presence of Alpha<br />\nDelta Phi fraternity is sometimes<br />\na problem for those on the side<br />\nof the building near it. The side<br />\nof the building away from the<br />\nfraternity has its own noise problems, particularly an early<br />\n(around 4-5 a.m.) garbage truck<br />\nwhich comes to haul away trash<br />\nfrom the Blackstone and<br />\nPizzApeel. Still, the noise really<br />\nis not all that bad, and one soon<br />\nlearns to sleep right through it.<br />\nThe only occupants of the<br />\nMayfair are students, although ,<br />\nlike McCoy, the doors are usually<br />\nshut.<br />\nSecurity does not really exist at<br />\nthe Mayfair. At the beginning of<br /><br />\nthe year, a combination lock was<br />\nplaced upon the front door to<br />\ndiscourage potential burglars, but<br />\nanyone who is persistent enough<br />\ncan get in. However, it somehow<br />\nseems to have deterred thieves.<br />\nThe management has made improvements over the past few<br />\nyears, including the lock on the<br />\nfront door, a commitment to exterminate for mice and roaches<br />\nevery month, and a fairly attentive maintenance characterizes a<br />\nwillingness to address the tenants'<br />\nconcerns. Air conditioning is still<br />\nlacking, though.<br />\nThose interested in living in the<br />\nMayfair must consider the annoying problems of mice, roaches,<br />\nnoise, and not-so-incredible<br />\napartment conditions. On the up<br />\nside are the fairly decent living<br />\nconditions, the amount of space<br />\nin the apartment, and especially<br />\nthe proximity to campus and<br />\nCharles Village.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nS<br />\nThe Blackstone and C arles<br />\nThe Charles and Blackstone<br />\nApartments are conveniently<br />\nlocated on Charles Street across<br />\nfrom the Homewood campus.<br />\nResidents have great views of the<br />\ncampus and its surrounding<br />\narea\u2014that is, if seeing the MSE<br />\nout of their windows doesn't<br />\nmake them nauseous.<br />\nA large variety of apartments<br />\nwith hardwood floors and plenty<br />\nof space are offered for one year<br />\nleases. The apartments include<br />\nstudios, efficiencies, and larger<br />\napartments. The rent of the units<br />\nranges anywhere from about<br />\n$280 to $1,200 per month. Heat<br />\nand water are included, but<br />\nresidents are required to pay for<br />\ngas, electricity, and telephone.<br />\nThe Charles and the Blackstone<br />\nare extremely popular for<br />\nHopkins students because of their<br /><br />\ngreat locations. Students can<br />\ncatch some extra sleep before<br />\ntheir first class and hop onto campus within seconds. WaWa, Eddie's and the bank are only<br />\nminutes away. The escort van<br />\nleaves from the library across the<br />\nstreet for Rotunda shopping.<br />\nThe condition of the two<br />\nbuildings, however, leaves much<br />\nto be desired. A major complaint<br />\nof the residents is the frequent<br />\nbreakdowns of the elevators.<br />\nSince both buildings have ten<br />\nfloors, the climb can take quite<br />\na toll on tired and out-of-shape<br />\nstudents. Some of the apartments<br />\nhave also been known to have<br />\nroaches. Yet the maintenance<br />\ncrew and the management are<br />\nquick and effective. They are<br />\nwilling to work with the residents<br />\nand make a huge effort to fix any<br /><br />\nproblems that may arise.<br />\nThe security of the Charles and<br />\nthe Blackstone consists of a<br />\nvisitors' intercom at the entrance<br />\nof the lobby. Often, a member of<br />\nthe maintenance crew keeps<br />\nwatch in the lobbies. Robberies<br />\nare rare but have been known to<br />\noccur, especially in the apartments on the lower floors.<br />\nLaundry facilities are offered in<br />\nthe buildings' basements. As expected, the residents of the<br />\nCharles and the Blackstone are<br />\nprimarily Hopkins students but<br />\nthe atmosphere tends to be quiet.<br />\nDespite several problems, the<br />\nCharles and the Blackstone are<br />\nexcellent choices for Hopkins<br />\nstudents\u2014especially for those<br />\nwho like to scrounge for every<br />\nlast minute of sleep.<br /><br />\nRowhouses<br /><br />\nA row of rowhouses<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nThe Charles<br /><br />\nDoreen Patron<br /><br />\nRowhouses offer unique offcampus living arrangements, and<br />\nlike apartment buildings, one can<br />\nexpect to find the full spectrum<br />\nof quality. Some rowhouses are<br />\nmodern, spacious and immaculately clean, rivaling the<br />\nmost luxurious of apartments.<br />\nOther times, houses can be older,<br />\nconfining or just plain shabby. In<br />\ngeneral, you get what you pay<br />\nfor, and thus it is important to<br />\nshop carefully when selecting a<br />\nrowhouse. As a rule of thumb,<br />\nrowhouses are slightly cheaper<br />\nthan apartment buildings.<br />\nAs houses come in all assortments and varieties, so do<br />\nlandlords. Some of these<br />\nlandlords will be extremely personable, helping you with all of<br />\nyour housing and living needs at<br />\na moment's notice. Others will be<br />\ndelaying and/or absent-minded,<br />\nunknowingly making your living<br />\narrangement a year-long<br />\nnightmare. Assessing a landlord<br />\nusually requires some prior<br />\nknowledge; that is, knowing<br />\nsomeone else who has rented<br />\nfrom a particular landlord before.<br />\nIf this option is not possible, the<br />\nUniversity housing office may<br />\nalso help steer you toward more<br /><br />\nreliable rowhouse options.<br />\nSome rowhouses are actual trilevel abodes, accommodating up<br />\nto five people. Other rowhouses<br />\nare divided into smaller units,<br />\nranging from one-person efficiencies to four-person apartments.<br />\nThe myths that you need five people to live in a rowhouse setting<br />\nare blatantly false.<br />\nThings to look for in a<br />\nrowhouse are integrity: Is it<br />\nvisibly damaged anywhere? Will<br />\nit stay warm in the winter, and<br />\ncool in the summer? Maryland<br />\nlaw requires all houses to have<br />\nsufficient heating systems for the<br />\nwinter months. Does the house<br />\nneed painting'? Many landlords<br />\nwill supply paint and supplies,<br />\noften free of charge. Security is<br />\nanother matter to consider. Most<br />\nrowhouses have only a durable<br />\nlock on their front door. As you<br />\napproach Greenmount Avenue to<br />\nthe east and Twenty-ninth Street<br />\nto the south, the risk of crime<br />\nbecomes greater, while the<br />\naverage quality and price of the<br />\nhouses decrease sharply.<br />\nMost of the rowhouses that<br />\nstudents rent are in Charles<br />\nVillage, concentrated upon St.<br />\nPaul Street, Calvert Street and<br /><br />\nGuilford Avenue. Many find the<br />\nwalk to campus averaging from<br />\n5 to 20 minutes, depending on<br />\nwhere you live. Many houses are<br />\nconvenient to the 'St. Paul Strip',<br />\nwhich includes Eddie's Supermarket and the Maryland National Bank. The Rotunda, with<br />\nits Giant supermarket, lies farther<br />\naway (up to three miles). Not all<br />\nrowhouses have laundry<br />\nmachines; some must carry their<br />\nclothes to a nearby laundrymat<br />\n(the St. Paul Strip has two). This<br />\nsometimes poses a great disadvantage to rowhouse living.<br />\nAll in all, rowhouse living can<br />\nbe a great and rewarding experience. Their codes and regulations are often less stringent than<br />\napartment buildings; thus, they<br />\npotentially can offer more<br />\nfreedoms. However, rowhouses<br />\ncan lack the modern conveniences<br />\nand efficient service that apartment dwellers take for granted.<br />\nMake sure that you have well<br />\nchecked into all of the aspects of<br />\na rowhouse before signing a<br />\nlease. If possible, talk to friends<br />\nthat now live in rowhouses to get<br />\nthe full and complete story.<br /><br />\nWyman Towers<br />\nWyman Towers is the<br />\nyellowish brick building conveniently located on the corner of<br />\nSt. Paul and 31st Streets, across<br />\nthe street from Eddie's,<br />\nHomewood Deli, and the<br />\nHopkins Store.<br />\nThe building has several things<br />\nin its favor. It is close to campus<br />\n(10 minutes from Mudd, 6-8<br />\nfrom Gilman). It is pretty safe for<br />\na building in Charles Village\u2014it<br />\nhas a buzzer phone-in system,<br />\nand a manager who is insistent<br />\nthat residents and their guests are<br />\nthe only ones let in the locked<br />\ndoors. The apartments are<br />\nspacious. The laundry facilities<br />\nare quite adequate; the 8 washers<br />\nand 8 dryers usually prevent<br />\n\u2022<br />\nwaits.<br />\nLike much of the housing in the<br />\narea, the building is old. All units<br /><br />\nhave the basic amenities, but not<br />\ndishwashers, garbage disposals,<br />\nor air conditioning. The units<br />\nlook their age and show some<br />\nevidence of many paint jobs, but<br />\nare otherwise in reasonably good<br />\nrepair. Maintenance is usually<br />\nprompt, as in the day of your request, or the day after.<br />\nThe building contains a mix of<br />\nstudents, young to middle-aged<br />\npeople, and elderly residents.<br />\nThere are some problems, such<br />\nas some roach problems and<br />\nsome mice. The management<br />\nmakes an effort to deal with the<br />\nproblems through a regular exterminating service. This helps the<br />\nproblem, but it may not eliminate<br />\nit, especially if your neighbors<br />\ndon't ask for it in their units.<br />\nThe other problem some<br />\nstudents report is in getting along<br /><br />\nwith the apartment manager.<br />\nSome advice: don't have wild<br />\nparties, be courteous to her, and<br />\nshe will be courteous to you. As<br />\nlong as you and your guests treat<br />\nher with respect, you will not<br />\nhave problems. She genuinely<br />\ncares about keeping her tenants<br />\nhappy.<br />\nWyman Towers has efficiencies, small and large one<br />\nbedroom, and small and large two<br />\nbedroom apartments. Rents range<br />\nfrom about $375-700. Each unit<br />\npays its own gas and electric. You<br />\nwill pay more than for a<br />\nrowhouse, but probably less than<br />\nfor university housing.<br />\nIf you don't mind roaches and<br />\nslightly expensive rent, and if<br />\nsecurity and convenience are important to you, check out Wyman<br />\nTowers.<br /><br />\nFraternity houses<br /><br />\nThe Phi Kappa Psi house<br /><br />\n. 111111rw'<br />\ntto00.<br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\n\u2022411,04:14 4\".\",<br /><br />\nWvitolownts<br />\n235 000<br /><br />\nWyman Towers<br />\nThe choice to live in a fraternity house is obviously not an option available to every student and<br />\nthe assignment of spaces is different for every fraternity or<br />\nsorority.

But in September these<br />\nwill all be hidden as the completely renovated Wolman Hall opens.<br />\nThe new Wolman will boast<br />\nmany attractive amenities, including a food court, conference<br />\nrooms, social lounges, and a<br />\ngame room. The six residential<br />\nfloors will be divided into two<br />\nwings and rooms will be<br />\narranged in four-person suites.<br />\nWolman is organized in suites,<br />\nwith either two doubles or a double and two singles. Every room<br />\nwill have air conditioning and<br />\nheating control as well as carpet<br />\nand dorm-style furnishings. Each<br />\nsuite will also have a kitchenette,<br />\nthough this seems pretty unnecessary since all Wolman<br />\nresidents are required to be on a<br />\nmeal plan. The common area in<br />\neach wing of each floor will have<br />\na TV and a VCR.<br />\nSecurity appears to be a high<br />\npriority in the design of the<br />\nbuilding. While any student can<br />\nenter the food court and the<br />\ndownstairs, entrance to the<br />\nresidential floors requires a<br />\nspecial card which is passed<br />\nthrough a reader. Each wing also<br />\nhas its own entrance lobby which<br />\nrequires card access. From the<br />\nentrance lobby, students can take<br />\nan elevator to their floor but need<br /><br />\nto pass their card through another<br />\nreader to gain access to the floor<br />\nitself. Finally, a monitor will be<br />\non hand to admit non-residents<br />\nand to keep out \"undesirables.\"<br />\nWolman does have some disadvantages. Rooms appear to be on<br />\nthe small side and bathrooms are<br />\ndownright tiny. As part of<br />\nUniversity housing, Wolman will<br />\nprobably cost more than comparable apartments in other<br />\nbuildings. And since the landlord<br />\nis the University, maintenance<br />\nmay be variable\u2014remember the<br />\nBradford?<br />\nThe 486 beds in Wolman are<br />\nreserved through the usual Housing Lottery. Resident Assistants,<br />\nWolman's<br />\nanswer<br />\nto<br />\nHousemasters, will be on hand in<br />\neach wing of each floor.<br />\nFinally, Wolman Hall undoubtedly has the best location<br />\noutside of the dorms\u2014library<br />\nfiends would argue it might even<br />\nbe better. And of course, it's right<br />\nacross the street from the St. Paul<br />\nshops.<br />\nWolman is ideal for those who<br />\nthrived in the dorm environment.<br />\nOther pluses are that it's brand<br />\nnew,(and thus pest-free), secure,<br />\nand furnished. And the location<br />\nsimply cannot be beat. But for<br />\nthose who want a little more<br />\nroom, independence, quiet, or<br />\nspending money, Wolman might<br />\nnot be the best choice.<br /><br />\nThe food court in Wolman under construction<br /><br />\nThe Bradford<br /><br />\nThe Baltimorean<br /><br />\nI have lived in the Bradford for<br />\nsix months now although it seems<br />\nlike an eternity. I have grown<br />\nrather used to riding up and down<br />\nin completely black elevators.<br />\nSeveral months ago, someone<br />\ndecided he did not like the globes<br />\nthat encase the light bulbs in the<br />\nelevators and took all of them out.<br />\nMaintenance does its part, of<br />\ncourse, by diligently replacing the<br />\nmissing light bulbs as they<br />\nvanish, yet I wonder if the<br />\nelevators will ever be returned to<br />\ntheir inital elegant, albeit dim atmosphere, with a fully restored<br />\nlight fixture. I doubt it.<br />\nOne always gets a creepy feeling stepping into a pitch black<br />\nelevator alone (invariably the<br />\nlight bulbs always disappear on<br />\na Friday night, for it is known<br />\nthat maintenance will not respond<br />\nuntil Monday morning). At least<br />\nthe elevators have been working<br />\nreliably, though. When they were<br />\nfirst installed, they had a tendency to break down, usually once<br />\na week and always on a Friday<br />\nnight, which again meant that<br />\nmaintenance would not notice until Monday morning. It is really<br /><br />\nThe units at the Baltimorean<br />\nare basically all large, furnished<br />\napartments and efficiencies. The<br />\napartments are very spacious with<br />\nfour rooms: a bedroom (with a<br />\npull-out couch), kitchen,<br />\nbathroom, and one other room<br />\nbetween the bedroom and<br />\nbathroom. The units cost about<br />\n$500 per month (on an elevenmonth lease); utilities (electricity, water, and gas) are included<br />\nin the rent but no air conditioning is available. Nine or twelvemonth leases can be obtained<br />\nThe building itself is old and<br />\nsome of the furnishings, notably,<br />\nthe oven and refrigerator, show<br />\ntheir age. Leaking pipes and<br />\nresulting water damage to the<br />\npaint and walls, is. an occasional<br />\nproblem. Even without the leaks,<br />\nmuch of the paint is cracking on<br />\nits own. With the exception of requests to have walls repainted<br />\n(due to cracking), maintenance<br />\nusually responds within a day or<br />\ntwo.<br />\nBugs are a problem, at least<br />\nduring the fall semester. While<br />\nthe University sent exterminators<br />\ntwice, it was not until after winter<br /><br />\nfun to walk seven flights of stairs<br />\nseveral times a day.<br />\nLaundry also becomes a real<br />\nadventure. The first time I did my<br />\nlaundry in this building, the<br />\nmachine got stuck in spin and<br />\nsudsed for over an hour before I<br />\nrealized and finally took my<br />\nclothes out and rewashed them.<br />\nMy apartment happens to have<br />\nthree separate phone lines<br />\nbecause Hopkins decided to wire<br />\neach individual room separately,<br />\nwhich left the students with the<br />\nextremely high cost of tying each<br />\nroom together. How silly of us to<br />\nassume hooking up one line<br />\nwould suffice for the entire<br />\napartment.<br />\nThese problems seemed<br />\nnegligible, though, initially. It<br />\nwas not until the great flood of<br />\n'90 that I really began to regret<br />\nmy move into the luxurious Bradford. My (wet and damp) apartment was one of the lucky chosen<br />\nfew to have new carpeting, which<br />\nmeant living with soggy,<br />\nmarshlike carpet for a week,<br />\nfollowed by plywood for several<br />\nmore weeks, until finally,<br />\nsometime late in October, the<br /><br />\n0110MOVRN<br /><br />\nBradford<br />\npromised plush carpeting was installed. We managed to survive<br />\nthis, and Housing was even<br />\ngracious enough to offer to pay<br />\nour first month's utilities (how<br />\ngenerous!).<br />\nThat seemed fair enough, yet<br />\nit is now February, and we have<br /><br />\nElisse Takara<br /><br />\nreceived two cutoff notices, for<br />\nHopkins has not yet paid<br />\nBaltimore Gas &amp; Electric for our<br />\nSeptember utility bill.

Well, apartments come unfurnished, the<br />\nHomewood deals in 12-month<br />\nleases only, and prices tend to be<br />\nhigher than at other locations,<br />\nespecially non-University dwellings. Rents for 1990-91 were: for<br />\nan efficiency, $390 per month;<br />\nfor a one-bedroom shared by two<br />\npeople, $217.50 per month per<br />\nperson; for a two-bedroom, $225<br />\nper month per person; for a threebedroom, $250 per month per<br />\nperson.

Additionally, there is no single<br />\nfloorplan, but manager Cora<br />\nPrice Townes, will be happy to<br />\nshow you several different spaces<br />\nfor your needs.<br />\nThe rent is a variable. For an<br />\nindividual, it can be high\u2014as<br />\nmuch as $425 a month for a<br />\n\"junior\" (smaller than a one<br />\nbedroom). But a two bedroom,<br />\nwhich can comfortably accommodate four people, is around<br />\n$900 a month, more in line with<br />\nstudent budgets. The rent includes heat (which is controlled<br />\ncentrally), hot and cold water,<br />\nand trash removal (just put it out<br />\non the fire escape Mon., Wed.,<br />\nor Fri.)<br />\nThere are several advantages to<br />\nliving in St. Paul Court, including<br />\nthe eponymous courtyard, which<br />\nhas a gazebo, flower beds,<br />\nseveral benches, and a fountain<br />\nfor reading or relaxing in warmer<br />\nweather. The close proximity to<br />\ncampus is a plus, as is the quiet<br />\natmosphere.

Dark,<br />\naustere paneling gives the<br />\nhallways the appearance of<br />\nCatholic-school dormitories, and<br />\nthe introversion of many tenants<br />\nonly confirms suspicions that<br />\npeople have taken a vow of<br />\nsilence.

Griffiths, professor of<br />\npsychiatry and neuroscience.<br />\n\"Our studies showed that low<br />\ndoses of caffeine were enough to<br />\nproduce withdrawal. . .People<br />\nwould not have thought that a<br />\ngreat proportion of the population<br />\nwas at risk of experiencing it.\"<br />\nIn the first part of the experiment, seven subjects were given<br />\n100 milligrams of caffeine a day.<br />\nA placebo (substance which looks<br />\nlike caffeine but is not) was then<br />\nintermittently substituted for 12<br />\ndays without the subject's<br />\nknowledge. Withdrawal effects<br />\npeaked at days one and two and<br />\nthen decreased, lasting for as long<br />\nas a week.<br />\nIn the second part of the experiment, the magnitude of<br />\nwithdrawal symptoms in comparison to caffeine dosages was<br />\ninvestigated as 17 subjects were<br />\nmaintained at 100, 300, or 600<br />\nmilligrams of capsulated caffeine<br />\na day. Headache magnitudes<br /><br />\nwere found to be significantly<br />\nhigher at the 600 milligram<br />\ndosage than at the 100 milligram<br />\ndosage.<br />\nThe withdrawal symptoms for<br />\nboth experiments were associated<br />\nwith increasing ratings of<br />\nheadache, drowsiness, and<br />\ndecreased ratings of energy.<br />\nOther symptoms that were found<br />\nwere not expected. \"Headache<br />\nand fatigue were primary<br />\nsymptoms\u2014we had known that<br />\nbefore.

The Jays repeat itself.<br />\n1.1 billion dollars!). Each of the<br />\ntwenty-six teams received an<br />\nequal portion of the T.V. booty,<br />\nwhich further enhanced the profit margins of large market teams.<br />\nAlthough this is highly unlikely, baseball should give each team<br />\na share of the network's dollars<br />\naccording to its local T.V. contract. The Yankees own a tenyear television contract that will<br />\npay them 50 million dollars per<br />\nseason, while the Mariners' local<br />\nT.V. and radio contract contributes only 3 million to their<br />\ncoffers. Consequently, the Major<br />\nLeague should give a greater sum<br />\nof the network dollars to the<br />\nMariners, than to the Yankees<br />\n(preferably to the point where all<br />\n26 teams are relatively equal in<br />\ntheir T.V. revenues).<br />\nNevertheless, the 26 major<br />\nleague teams would still not be on<br />\nequal financial footing. Concessions, ticket sales, and merchandise figure heavily into each<br />\nteam's profits and are a reflection<br />\nof a team's success and failure.<br />\nRedistribution of these items<br />\nwould take away any incentive to<br />\nwin.<br />\nWhat is needed is the salary<br />\ncap, in which the size of payrolls<br />\nwould be tied to a percentage of<br />\nthe league's overall revenues.

Even appeals for humanitarian aid from<br />\nthe Kurds were ignored. The CIA<br />\nagents under the Director of the<br />\nCIA, George Bush, were instructed: \"Don't reply to these<br />\nappeals, we don't know these<br />\npeople al all! This never<br />\nhappened.\"<br />\nWith the overthrow of the Shah<br />\nand the revolution in Iran, the<br />\nUnited States tilted towards Iraq.<br />\nNational Security Advisor<br />\nZbigniew Brzezinski stated in<br />\npublic \"that he hoped the Iraqis<br />\nwould seize the chance offered<br />\nthem by the apparently unstable<br />\nIran and cross the border and<br />\npress their claim to Arabistan.\"<br />\nThe U.S. supplied intelligence<br />\nand satellite information to the<br />\nIraqi regime through Kuwait and<br />\nSaudi Arabia in an effort to encourage them to start the Iran-Iraq<br />\nwar, Hitchens claimed. A long<br />\nmilitary relationship with Iraq ensued, \"strong enough to withstand the rocketing of the<br />\nU.S.S. Stark by an Exocet missile<br />\n[by an Iraqi jet in 1987].\"<br />\nAt the same time, the ReaganBush campaign had made a<br />\nprivate deal with the Iranians to<br />\ndelay the release of American<br />\nhostages in Iran to sabotage the<br />\nCarter presidency, Hitchens said,<br />\nciting an interview in a PBS<br />\ndocumentary with former National Security Officer Gary Sick.<br />\nA covert operation of supplying<br />\narms to Iran during the Iran-Iraq<br />\nwar began, which culminated in<br />\nthe Iran-Contra affair. According<br />\nto Hitchens, such a policy of supporting both sides in the war is<br />\nentirely consistent with a divide<br />\nand rule policy of playing one end<br />\nagainst another.<br /><br />\nOn the other front in Saudi<br />\nArabia, the U.S. offered to build<br />\nand pay for a massive network of<br />\ncommand, naval, and air defense<br />\nfacilities in exchange for \"an integrated package of top-of-theline military technology,\" Hitchens quoted at length from an article published by Scott Armstrong in Harper's Magazine. In<br />\nan issue paper written by Major<br />\nGeneral Richard V. Secord, the<br />\nhopes were raised \"that the<br />\nSaudis can invite a permanent<br />\nU.S. presence in the Gulf<br />\nregion.\"<br />\n\"In peacetime,[however],\" a<br />\nCarter administration official<br />\nsaid, \"no country in the region<br />\nis prepared to accept U.S. bases<br />\nin peace time. They're willing to<br />\nlet us provide all the technical<br />\nassistance, to design the systems,<br />\nto maintain them, to support them<br />\nand even to operate them, but not<br />\nunder the American flag, we've<br />\ngot to fly their flag.\"<br />\nThe U.S. did not, however,<br />\nbuild the bases in Saudi Arabia<br />\nwith the understanding that they<br />\nwould be used in a future armed<br />\nconflict with Iraq, Hitchens said.<br />\n\"No one was looking for a war<br />\nwith Saddam Hussein. Saddam<br />\nHussein had been made a particular pet of American defense<br />\ncontractors, American farmers,<br />\nand of the State Department. It<br />\nwas understood that the border<br />\ndispute [between Iraq and<br />\nKuwait] was of long standing and<br />\nnot a dispute where Kuwait was<br />\nblameless; that was understood in<br />\nWashington and communicated to<br />\nSaddam himself by James<br />\nBaker's envoy [Ambassador<br />\nApril Glaspie].\"<br />\n\"What the [U.S.] thought was<br />\ngoing to happen [in the border<br /><br />\ndispute] was the repartitioning of of State James Baker had gone so<br />\nKuwait in miniature, the opening far as to warn Foreign Minister<br />\nof a corridor to the sea by Iraq, Eduard Shevardnadze of the comthe probable taking of the ing Iraqi invasion and reassured<br />\nRumalia oilfield or at least the him that the conquest would be<br />\nnorthern part of it, and the annex- acceptable to the rest of the<br />\nation of the two adjacent islands world.<br />\nof Bubiyan and Warba.\" Such a<br />\n\"Saddam's exorbitance,\" Hitdevelopment was actually favored chens went on, \"forced [the<br />\nby the United States and Britain, United States] to do what empires<br />\nwho had long been urging the must do and remind people who<br />\nKuwaitis to make territorial con- is in charge.
