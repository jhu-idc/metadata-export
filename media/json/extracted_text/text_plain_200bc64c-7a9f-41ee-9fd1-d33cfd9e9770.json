Much<br />\nof lonesco's play is puzzling, but that is where its impact<br />\nlies. From the very beginning the protagonist, First Man,<br />\nis presented as a confused individual, uncertain of who,<br />\nwhat, and where he is, and of the exact length of time he<br />\nhas existed. Despite a rather slow beginning, the Man's<br />\nstory begins to unfold as his family appears, one by one,<br />\neach at various ages and each exhibiting both ,animosity,<br />\nand affection toward the Man. Those who have diec have<br />\nreturned, oftem much younger than the Man remembers<br />\nthem. There are interesting statements made about death,<br />\n<br />\nThe omnipresent bags become identified with theI<br />\ncharacter himself. He is uncertain of their contents,<br />\nalthough he values them as he does his seemingly<br />\nmeaningless existence. He refuses to let them out of his<br />\nsight, and is reluctant to let another person even handle<br />\nthem. Both he and his bags are treated with disdain:<br />\ntossed about, neglected, and always extraneous. Several<br />\ncharacters he meets attempt to separate him from his<br />\nbelongings, but are unsuccessful.<br />\nIt is revealed midway through the play that there exists<br />\na \u2022third bag, which has apparently been lost in transit. In<br />\nthis bag are the Man's manuscripts, which contain most of<br />\nhis ideas, beliefs and experiences, without which he is<br />\nempty. The lost bag thus becomes the missing link which<br />\ncan answer the Man's endless questions. perhaps<br />\n<br />\n'Man with Bags' Sept. 14 through October 1. 8:30 pm,TSU<br />\n<br />\ndream while awake.

The outside world is not closed to us, but it is<br />\nthe essential aspect of the outside world which falls under<br />\nour gaze, and the scrutiny of our consciousness.... It is<br />\noften, it is above all in the dream state that I experience a<br />\nfundamental anguish: the sense of danger, my coexistence<br />\nwith others, my condition in this world:the knoWinge of<br />\ndeath ....

The English<br />\ntranslation by lonesco 's daughter, Marie-France lonesco,<br />\nwas adapted for the American stage by famed playwright<br />\nIsrael Horovitz. Berman approached Horovitz with the<br />\nidea of producing the play at Towson, and he agreed.<br />\nWhen they approached Carly Simon, who had read the<br />\nplay, with the idea of her writing the music for it, she<br />\nenthusiastically agreed. Horovitz attended several August<br />\nrehearsals,<br />\nand offered suggestions based on his<br />\nthe play, and he was present at the<br />\nof<br />\ninterpretation<br />\nplay's September 14 premiere.<br />\nMan With Bags will be seen through October 1.

The Man speaks of \"tired ideas, worn-out stories, and updated<br />\ntries to get a passport in order to leavethis place,\" which ideals,\" and longs for a new beginning, a \"fresh start.\" He<br />\nis still unnamed, but is unable to do so because he lacks later dumps out the contents of the smaller bag and kicks<br />\nproper identification.

Although Airto had done some recording<br />\nfor Buddha, the resultant success of Light As A Feather<br />\nnetted him a contract with CTI, and it was this<br />\nconnection that first brought Airto's uniquely Brasilian<br />\njazz to the attention of American listeners.<br />\nAirto's first album for CTI was a star-studded<br />\nextravagance which showed off Creed Taylor's stable<br />\nbetter than it did Airto's music. Although the presence of<br />\nChick Corea, Joe Farrell, Stanley Clarke and other<br />\nassorted jazz \"names\" may have added to the sales, they<br />\ndid nothing for the music. In fact, Free (CTI 6020) is<br />\nrather like one of those candy samplers, where some of<br />\nthe nuggets are tantalizing yet unfulfilling while others<br />\n<br />\nseem mere filler.<br />\nDiscounting Free and Virgin Land (a half-hearted<br />\nattempt at funk, which Taylor shuffled off to his<br />\nSalvation label), Airto's CTI recordings show a real<br />\ndevelopment in his attempt to fuse jazz and Brasilian<br />\nmusics. Fingers (CTI 6028) stands as perhaps Airto's<br />\nfinest album, and it also acted as the foundation for OPA<br />\nas well as a standard for Flor Purirh's sessions as a leader.<br />\nPerhaps the prime example of the album's fusion of the<br />\ntwo is Hugo Fattoruso's Parana. Although the head is<br />\nkind of jazzy in its own way, the improvisation is upon a<br />\nsimple one-chord rhythm vamp. The first soloist is Airto,<br />\nwho scats and finally drifts into some wonderfully<br />\nrhythmic Portuguese lyrics. Although there is no<br />\nindication that the lyrics were part of the song, the<br />\nnaturalness of their flow would imply a sort of<br />\npre-existence; yet they carry a sense of spontaneity<br />\ncharacteristic of an improvised riff. Jon Hendricks in<br />\nPortuguese?<br />\nRegardless, the vocalisation is placed against Hugo<br />\nFattoruso playing a piano solo (which he whistles along<br />\nwith). Both the colours and the texture of the solos carry<br />\nan indigenous, South American flavour, while the use of<br />\nmodes and turn-arounds indicate a strong jazz scbooling.<br />\nWhat one is left with, then, is not jazz with Brasilian<br />\neffects, as in the old Stan Getz samba spectaculars, but<br />\njazz that is also Brasilian music.<br />\nOf course, the album showed other aspects of Airto<br />\nand his band. his sense of lyricism (\"San Francisco<br />\nRiver\"), his ability to play odd meters with a formidable<br />\n<br />\nChaplain to give<br />\nOur Daily Bread<br />\nBY MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nKing Vidor's Our Daily Bread (1934), to be shown at<br />\nthe Reel World this Sunday at 7:30 p.m., has much in<br />\ncommon with an earlier Vidor film, The Crowd (1928),<br />\nbecause it stated, through the unemployment and social<br />\ninsignificance of its hero, John, that the \"Coolidge<br />\nprosperity\" was not benefitting all segments of society. In<br />\nThe Crowd Vidor implied that the capitalist system, based<br />\non competition, not cooperation, ignored the common<br />\nman. Unfortunately, the common man ignored The<br />\nCrowd and it was a box-office failure.<br />\nNeither MGM's Irving Thalberg nor any other studio<br />\nwould touch Vidor's idea, because, as Vidor complained<br />\nin the September 1934 issue of New Theatre : \"The final<br />\ndecisions are made by business men, not artists,\" and the<br />\nHollyw000d businessmen had not forgotten the financial<br />\nfailure of The Crowd. \"I was left with the alternative,\"<br />\nwrote Vidor, \"to raise the money and make the picture<br />\nmyself.\" Withthe support of Charles Chaplin he was able<br />\nto obtain loans and finance his project.<br />\nVidor's struggle to film Our Daily Bread is probably<br />\nmore impressive than the film itself. The opening credits<br />\ntell us that \"Headlines of Today\" were the basis for Our<br />\nDaily Bread's plot, and certainly the first few scenes,<br />\nwhere John, unemployed,is unable to pay the rent, are an<br />\naccurate depiction of what life was like, for millions of<br />\npeople in 1934. John concludes, along with Vidor, that<br />\nmoving back to the land is \"the only answer\" to the<br />\nDepression. When John moves from the city to. a farm<br />\n<br />\nsense of swing (\"Tomba in 7/4\"), and his ability to<br />\nconceive and achieve a studio sense of sound which<br />\ndoesn't sterilize the music (\"fingers\").<br />\nUnfortunately, there was a break in Airto's recorded<br />\noutput, due in large part to the imprisonment of his wife<br />\nFlora Purim. Because Flora had the misfortune to be in<br />\nthe same apartment with a cocaine user when that<br />\napartment was raided, she was arrested and charged with<br />\npossession. Despite repeated testimony that Flora was not<br />\na user, and certainly not involved, she was placed in<br />\nprison after having been found guilty of possession.<br />\n(Perhaps this, when compared to the light sentence<br />\nreceived by Louise Lasser for possession, would serve as<br />\nadequate example of the levels and degrees of American<br />\ncourt justice.)<br />\nUp to that time, Flora had released her first two<br />\nalbums as a solo act, and was quickly gaining notice as<br />\none of America's foremost jazz singers. Working with such<br />\njazz stalwarts as Joe Henderson, George Duke, Miroslav<br />\nVitous and Stanley Clarke, Flora was moving in an<br />\nelectric-jazz direction, not quite rock, but not Ella<br />\nFitzgerald either.<br />\nWhen she gained her freedom, she returned to the<br />\nstudio, and took a much more elctronic direction. her<br />\nalbums became more studio oriented, and even though<br />\nthey still included Airto, guitarist David Amaro and<br />\nHermetto Pascoal, they did not carry the heavily Brasilian<br />\nflavor of Airto's albums. Open Your Eyes You Can Fly<br />\n(Milestone 9065) walked the thin line between jazz-rock<br />\nand commercial jazz pop. In fact, if it were not for the<br />\nexcellence of the studio musicians (among them Ron<br />\nCarter, George Duke and Al Johnson), the album could<br />\nhave slipped into the commercial dreck featuied on Flor's<br />\nfirst Warner Brothers album.<br />\nWhile all this was going on, Airto had begun to record<br />\nagain, this time for Arista. His first album, Identity<br />\n(Arista 4068), featured most of the same people his CTI<br />\nalbums had used, in addition to Herbie Hancock and<br />\nWayne Shorter.<br />\nShorter had become interested in Brasilian jazz in the<br />\n(Super<br />\nlate sixties, and his last albums for Blue Note<br />\nbits<br />\ncarried<br />\nIska)<br />\nof<br />\nNova, Moto Grosso Feio, Odyssey<br />\nColumbia<br />\nfirst<br />\nhis<br />\nwas<br />\nit<br />\nBut<br />\nand pices of Brasilian music.<br />\npoint<br />\nalbum, Native Dancer(PC- 33418), which drove the<br />\nhome. Using an all-star Brasilian-American cast, the album<br />\nincluded Airto, Amaro, Hancock, and Shorter as well as<br />\nMilton Nascimento and his organist Wagner Tiso, Roberto<br />\nSilva(who later joined Airto's band), and others.<br />\nAlthough Shorter and Hancock were only cameo<br />\nplayers on Identity, their presence gave the movement<br />\ncredibility, a live session at Montreux called Five Hundred<br />\nMiles High. (M-9070)' This album, featuring Airto,<br />\nRoberto, David Amaro, Wagner Tiso, Ron Carter, Pat<br />\nRebillot, and a walk on by Milton was the pinnacle of<br />\nnear the town of Arcadia, Vidor moves from town to<br />\ncountry as well: the often drab, neo-realistic style which<br />\ncharacterized his exploration of urban life in The Crowd<br />\nis replaced by a pastoral vision of life on a farm. \"There<br />\nmust be a lot of fellows in the same boat,\" muses John<br />\nduring a philosophic rest from his labors,\" and he<br />\nproposes \"a sort of cooperative where money isn't so<br />\nimportant...`You help me, I help you.\"<br />\nThe poor families of Our Daily Bread have been<br />\ncrushed by an economic depression, and the<br />\nabandonment of their own farms ,and towns, their<br />\nbanding together on a collective farm, is an explicit<br />\nrejection of their society, a society which in many ways<br />\nhas rejected them. Alternative forms of government,<br />\ndemocratic and socialistic, are dismissed without any real_<br />\ndebate, for literally every man present, no matter what his<br />\nbackground, concludes that the ideal form of government<br />\nis a dictatorship. John may be a benevolent dictator, but<br />\nsomehow the notion of communal sharing and ownership,<br />\nthe very notion which brought these people to the farm,<br />\nwould tend toward other than an autocratic form of<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nAnother major flaw is that when dissension arises in the<br />\ncommune it comes from outside rather than inside forces.<br />\nVidor somehow didn't seem to realize that most true<br />\ntensions and conflicts would result from within the<br />\ncommune itself, when the people themselves discovered<br />\nthe impossibility of completely sublimating their selfish,<br />\ncompetitive desires. There are a few people in the<br />\ncommune who occasionally step out of line and are<br />\npromptly punched out by ,John, but the real tensions in<br />\nthe commune result from two outside forces, a platinum<br />\nblonde and a drought.<br />\nEveryone finds a place in Vidor's new society: even a<br />\nviolinist finds employment, teaching the children; even<br />\nSally is put to work, taking inventory. These are dreamy,<br />\npastoral sections of the film, in which the tiny shacks, like<br />\nrustic doll houses, dot the Arcadian countryside. It's a<br />\n<br />\nFlora's jazz singing, and (remarkably) did not lose it's<br />\nsense of Brasil. The jazz-folk fusion was beconfing more<br />\nand more of a reality.<br />\nSo what happened now? Airto's last album,Promises of<br />\nthe Sun had its moments, but couldn't quite measure up<br />\nto the high standards of Fingers. His new album, I'm<br />\nFine,How Are You (to be reviewed in the future) doesn't<br />\nseem to be quite it either.<br />\nThe Fattoruso brothers, Jorge and Hugo, formed OPA<br />\nwith Ringo Thielman. All were part of the Fingers band,<br />\nwith David Amaro and Flora. Although their<br />\npiano-bass-drums format would imply a sense of<br />\ntraditional jazz, their electronic experiments do not work<br />\nout as such. \"Corre Nina\" on their first album, Golden<br />\nWings,(Milestone M-9069) carries a strong sense of what<br />\nthey could have done if only they concentrated their<br />\nefforts on direction. As for their current album, Magic<br />\nTime (Milestone M-9078), although it is a delightful burst<br />\nof energy, it's just a little too smugly electronic, too coyly<br />\ncomposed to seem genuine.<br />\nWhen it comes to selling out to demon dollar, the<br />\nall-time award must go to trombonist Raul de Souza.<br />\nAlthough he made his name as Brasil's Best Jazz<br />\nTrombonist by age 23, he has always seemed better suited<br />\nto background playing than lead spots. His technique is<br />\nalright, but without polish or precision (perhaps due to<br />\nhis preference for the half-bass trombone). His newest<br />\nalbum, Sweet Lucy, is outrageously commercial, which<br />\nalthough not a sin in itself, proves to be a waste of both<br />\nthe liste er's and t e \u2022la ers' time.<br />\n<br />\nRaul de Souza lacks the brash, ballsy funk of, say, Dave<br />\nBargeron, or the super-slick slidework of Bill Watrous. His<br />\nstyle is best suited to a fluid, lyrical-line, Which is fine for<br />\nBrasilian music. But if you insist on getting down, for<br />\nGod's sake do it right.<br />\nOn the whole, though, the signs are good for more<br />\n,\u2022 ,ake its way to our sunny shores.

There is a great cheer and<br />\ndancing in the mud once the water flows, and an idyllic,<br />\nflasliforward closing shot of IharvestL time. Cinematically,<br />\nthe irrigation ditch sequence, which contains practically<br />\nno dialogue, is an extremely Powerful and memorable<br />\nexperience.<br />\nThat final sequence, one of the most admired in<br />\nAmerican cinema, and the touching might-have-been<br />\natmosphere of the entire film, are perhaps the main<br />\nreasons why Our Daily Bread is still shown and discussed<br />\ntoday, but in 1934 what might have been a nationaltopic<br />\nof conversation wasn't, and the Film, like The Crowd<br />\nbefore it, was a box-office failure.<br />\nThe Hearst press, as might be expected, called it<br />\n\"pinko,\" but the leftist press was equally harsh: The<br />\nNation called it a \"travesty...the familiar enough attempt<br />\nof the liberal mind to reconcile the hope of a small<br />\ncollectivist unit with an acceptance of...capitalist<br />\nsociety,\" and The New Masses described Vidor as a<br />\n\"Hollywood anarchist with an inherent sympathy for the<br />\nunderdog,\" but went on to criticize his \"undeveloped<br />\npolitical understanding.\"<br />\nBy way, perhaps, of a consolation prize,because of the<br />\ncritical and popular approval which it failed to receive,<br />\nthe League of Nations awardedOur Daily Bread a gold<br />\nmedal, but Vidor, hurt in the pocket and probably in the<br />\nheart as well, soon returned to the Hollywood fold.<br />\n<br />\n\fBALTIMORE FREE UNIVERSITY<br />\nFAR 1977<br />\nThe Baltimore Free University is a non-profit, non-partisan volunteer<br />\norganization which seeks to provide an open educational forum for the exchange<br />\nof skills, information, and ideas within a flexible non-graded structure.

Though fighting<br />\nwith mock swords and wooden shileds, the combatants<br />\nflail away at each other with unbounded enthusiasm. The<br />\nduels aren't all fun and games. A blow from one of those<br />\nhard wood swords, which are weighted to accurately<br />\nsimulate a real sword, delivered by an experienced hand,<br />\ncan leave a painful bruise. (I know -- I have several of<br />\nthem already).<br />\nBut if one isn't particularly interested in fighting with<br />\nsword and shield (though the impulse to don armor and<br />\nhelmet is almost_ irresistible), one can always try being a<br />\nmagician, juggler, court jester, bard, squire, alchemist,<br />\nyeoman, or even a simple peasant -- if you like tilling soil.<br />\nIn fact, the SCA encourages people to join who are<br />\ninterested in most anything about the Middle Ages. If one<br />\nhas ever been thinking about the days when bold gents<br />\nand fair ladies made their own music, candles, and<br />\nentertainment, when feasts were held to rouse the spirit<br />\nand empty the mead tankard, this is the clu b to join.<br />\nWhy do people from our modern technological society<br />\nwish to go back in time to the days of King Arthur or<br />\nHenry VIII? After all, the common man of today lives<br />\nbetter than the richest King ever did a thousand years ago.<br />\nWhat is it about the Middle Ages that stirs the imagination<br />\nof the members to actually attempt to simulate the days<br />\nof yore?<br />\nThe answers may surprise you: they surprised me. The<br />\nSCA is not attempting to simulate the Dark Ages, which is<br />\nan ominous and revealing title to one of our most<br />\nmisunderstood historical ages, but is, rather, trying to<br />\nshow the Middle Ages as they should have been. As one<br />\nmember put it,\"We don't want to reinstitute plague.\"<br />\nThe Dark Ages was a time of disease and war, a period<br />\nof both religious and political rigidity. These facets of the<br />\n<br />\nMiddle Ages arc remembered all too well by the textbook<br />\nreaders. What the SCA presents is the other side of the<br />\ngold piece: the music, arts, dancing, literature, poetry,<br />\nchivalry, feasts, jousts, and folklore of the years from 700<br />\nAD to roughly 1650 AD. Individual creativity, something<br />\ntoday 's industrialized common man sadly lacks,<br />\nflourished during the years of lords and castles, and it is<br />\nthis essence of creativity which the SCA wishes to capture<br />\nand expand upon.<br />\nIn case the reader should think that the SCA is a crew<br />\nof hopeless romantics centered in the Baltimore area, it<br />\nshould be known that the SCA is a nationwide one.<br />\nholding feasts, jousts, and other events periodically<br />\nthroughout the year. Two Kingdoms, the Eastern<br />\nKingdom and the Western Kingdom, compete between<br />\nthemselves for the lost glory of nights in shining armor<br />\nwinning damsels in distress. Sadly, there are no dragons<br />\nleft to fight on this world.<br />\nIn a sense, however, all SCA members are.incurably in<br />\nlove with the Age of Chivalry. A member gets to choose<br />\nhis or her own name, title, family history, etc. -- the only<br />\nlimit being that one cannot be named after a real person<br />\nor fictionalized character without permission, which is<br />\nslightly difficult in the former case. For those Tolkien,<br />\nMoorcock, or other fantasy readers, this is your chance to<br />\nbecome a part of the fantasy you always hoped you could<br />\nact out but never dared.<br />\nIf you insist on being a fighting man or woman,armor<br />\nis something of a problem. There are strict rules and<br />\nregulations as to what one can wear or must wear, set by<br />\nthe SCA higher echelons. To engage the Black Knight, I<br />\nhad to don armor which barely fit, a helm which almost<br />\ntore off my ears, hockey gloves for fist barding, elbow<br />\npads\u2018 which constantly fell off, and a leather knee pad<br />\nwhich really was meant to be a thigh pad. The only<br />\nadvantages my opponent had were superior training,<br />\nphysique, and armor.. I won't bore you with the trivial<br />\ndetails of how the fight progressed: suffice it to say that I<br />\nam burning with desire to avenge my honor...<br />\nTherefore, if you can peel yourself away from studying<br />\nfor a knight, come an,d see the SCA on _either the<br />\nFreshmen Quad or the field in front of Garland. Lose<br />\nyourself to a time of honour and chivalry, of jousting and<br />\njesting, of good fun.<br />\nAdam Gruen<br />\n<br />\nGus ti ye Dore<br />\n<br />\nrcaLURcl 1<br />\n<br />\n4ti<br />\n<br />\n\fCross-country<br />\n<br />\nIt's a sport without fans,<br />\nA sport of different goals<br />\na season<br />\nahead<br />\nCross-country has never been the sport that threatened<br />\nto push aside lacrosse as Hopkins' number one status,<br />\nspectator, or macho activity. It's unfortunate, however,<br />\nbecause the team's strong finish last year in the Maryland<br />\nAthletic Conference year-end meet should be enough to<br />\nwarrant greater support from the Hopkins community.<br />\nTheir mediocre season in '76 was topped off by what the<br />\ncoach, Randy Cockey. called a big plus. Specifically, they<br />\nfinished third out of 17 schools in the MAC meet,having<br />\nbeen edged out of first by Gettysburg and Franklin &<br />\nMarshall.<br />\nThis year the big competition seems to be F&M,and a<br />\nnew threat, Ursinus. According to the ever optimistic<br />\ncoach, however, this year's season is already beginning to<br />\nlook good. \"Potentially, we have our best team this year.<br />\nIt's a matter of getting every runner at his best as far as<br />\nhis condition is concerned. My duty is to give suggestions,<br />\nrunning opportunities, and to set up the schedule. But<br />\nbasically, they're on their own.\"<br />\nThere is no significant change in the training schedule<br />\nthis year, although a change in the length of the 5.0 mile<br />\nrace to 6.1 miles or 10,000 meters has created a need for<br />\nlonger running during practices. Hopkins is already ahead<br />\nof the game here though, because the home course is 5.7<br />\nt miles, which gives Hopkins' runners an added edge. Right<br />\nnow, the team is in their \"long- run\" phase, and is not on<br />\nthe track at all.

This was Suesse's first assist in a<br />\nBlue Jay uniform since he was shifted from goalie to this<br />\noffensive position.<br />\nThe Hoyas countered a minute later when they caught<br />\nthe Jay defense sleeping and slipped a goal by George<br />\nCoutres, the new Blue Jay goaltender.<br />\nFrosh midfielder Carney scored what proved to be the<br />\nwinning tally late in the game when he fired a 25 foot<br />\nshot that went untouched by the Georgetown goalie into<br />\nthe bottom right-hand corner of the net.<br />\nThe Hoyas made it close in the waning moments when<br />\nthey put in their second goal. but it was not enough.<br />\nCoach Bob Oliver, who led the soccer team to a<br />\ndivision championship in 1975, is coming off a<br />\ndisappointing), 5-5-1 record but looks to improve on that<br />\nmark, especially in-division play. \"We looked real good<br />\ntoday,\" said the coach, \"Georgetown is a division one<br />\nteam and they always offer us good competition. I am<br />\nvery enthusiastic about the coming season. Even though<br />\nwe've lost some strength up the middle with the<br />\ngraduation of Tom Myrick and Gary Ignatowski, I think<br />\nwe may come close to filling their big shoes.\"<br />\nCo-captains Larry McGowan and Frank Olszewski, an<br />\nalternate on the U.S.i0lympic Soccer Team, should<br />\nprovide some veteran strength on offense and defense<br />\nrespectively. Starting striker Bob Teasdall returned after<br />\nbeing out his entire sophomore year and will provide<br />\nsome scoring punch up front.<br />\n<br />\nOther returning lettermen for Oliver's Blue Jay soccer<br />\nteam include senior deepback Tom Ball, junior deepback<br />\nLee Friant, junior defenseive stopper Steve Galloway,<br />\nsenior winger Joe Siemek, sophomore middie Ed Vance,<br />\nand junior wingers Jeff Weissglass and Richard Welch.<br />\nThe next home game will take place tomorrow on<br />\nHomewood field when the Jays meet division rival<br />\nHaverford College.<br />\n<br />\nThe next home game will take<br />\nplace Saturday on Homewood Field.<br />\n<br />\nMt.

This<br />\nis only the pick of the crop, however, and this year's<br />\ncross-country team has the largest turnout ever, with a<br />\nlarge number of freshmen opting for positions.<br />\nDavid Stewart, a freshman from Cherry Hill, New<br />\nJersey, is trying out for a team slot and is quite impressed<br />\nwith the caliber of the Hopkins program and its attitude<br />\ntoward sports and studies. \"The pressure of running<br />\ndepends largely on its program. The JHU program takes<br />\nthe academics into account and allows freedoms. You can<br />\nset your own pace and goals, and decide how hard you<br />\nwant to work.\" Stewart is one of about a half dozen<br />\nfreshman trying out for tile team. Because of the large<br />\nproportion of graduating seniors, the future success of the<br />\ncross- country team lies with these new additions.<br />\nThe selection process for the team differs from that of<br />\nother varsity sports. No one is ever cut from the roster.<br />\nBut because of room in the bus going to away races, only<br />\ntwelve runners are allowed to go to away meets. Coach<br />\nCockey explains that the selection process is dependent<br />\nupon finishing positions after the first race. \"For the first<br />\nrace, positions are assigned by me according to their times<br />\non the track and from watching them. After that, its all<br />\ndependant on how they do in that first race and in<br />\nsubsequent races.\"<br />\nThe amazing factor, though, behind the runners who go<br />\nout for cross- country is why they bother to run at all.<br />\nThere have never been fans turned away from a Hopkins<br />\nmeet, nor do the runners get the publicity that any of the<br />\nother sports receive on this campus. There is no great \"big<br />\nman on campus\" attitude toward anyone on the team<br />\nMost students probably do not even know that there is a<br />\nteam. Jim Kennedy, co-captain, feels that cross-country<br />\nrunners are not in the sport for the social side of it.<br />\nnot a grandstand sport. You don't run cross- country tc<br />\nrun socially. We have different goals.\"<br />\n<br />\nOther team members explain their love for the spor<br />\nthis way. \"You mainly look to improve your time<br />\nCertainly you want to do well for the team and win, bu<br />\nmostly you want self-improvement.\" Coach Cockey is<br />\nhoping for a larger support from fans this year. \"We never<br />\nturn fans away at a. race, and this year with the hint o<br />\nsuccess so imminant, we're hoping that people will turi<br />\nout more to see our team run.\"<br />\nWith the first cross-country race this Wednesday<br />\nSeptember 21 at Loyola, and the first home race.

Though Pfeffer is perhaps best known for his Marxist leanings, ideology is not the issue at this time. Nor, in fact, is the<br />\nPolitical Science Department,s decision not to award him the tenured position of full professor. Instead, the issue at hand is the Academic<br />\nCouncil,s refusal to appoint an ad hoc committee to review Pfeffer,s case more thouroughly.<br />\nIt is a fundamental tenet of the American and all other civilized systems ofjurisprudence that one is entitled to appeal a court decision<br />\nhe deems injust. Yet the Academic Council has denied Professor Pfeffer this right by rejecting his plea for an ad hoc committee<br />\ninvestigation. Thus, if Pfeffer was indeed the victim of bias and antagonism within his department, the Council has eliminated the<br />\npossibility of exoneration.<br />\nFurther evaluation of Pfeffer's candidacy for tenure, then, is not simply a professional question, but .a moral one as well. The<br />\ncontroversy over Pfeffer's scholarship has not been conclusively resolved, and in the interests of fairness, deeper consideration of the<br />\nmatter becomes imperative. We of the Student Council support an ad hoc committee investigation of Professor Pfeffer's record.<br />\nawid Cliesatzow<br />\nStudent Council President<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "\u2018<br />\n7<br />\n3<br />\n1I:<br />\n11<br />\n1<br /><br />\n1111C<br />\n1CL 1<br />\nSept. 16, 197<br /><br />\nvol. 82 no.<br /><br />\nSNACK BAR ROBBED<br />\nDrunken thieves take $800<br />\nTwo men, armed with knives, held three at bay early yesterday as shortly afterward.

Much<br />\nof lonesco's play is puzzling, but that is where its impact<br />\nlies. From the very beginning the protagonist, First Man,<br />\nis presented as a confused individual, uncertain of who,<br />\nwhat, and where he is, and of the exact length of time he<br />\nhas existed. Despite a rather slow beginning, the Man's<br />\nstory begins to unfold as his family appears, one by one,<br />\neach at various ages and each exhibiting both ,animosity,<br />\nand affection toward the Man. Those who have diec have<br />\nreturned, oftem much younger than the Man remembers<br />\nthem. There are interesting statements made about death,<br /><br />\nThe omnipresent bags become identified with theI<br />\ncharacter himself. He is uncertain of their contents,<br />\nalthough he values them as he does his seemingly<br />\nmeaningless existence. He refuses to let them out of his<br />\nsight, and is reluctant to let another person even handle<br />\nthem. Both he and his bags are treated with disdain:<br />\ntossed about, neglected, and always extraneous. Several<br />\ncharacters he meets attempt to separate him from his<br />\nbelongings, but are unsuccessful.<br />\nIt is revealed midway through the play that there exists<br />\na \u2022third bag, which has apparently been lost in transit. In<br />\nthis bag are the Man's manuscripts, which contain most of<br />\nhis ideas, beliefs and experiences, without which he is<br />\nempty. The lost bag thus becomes the missing link which<br />\ncan answer the Man's endless questions. perhaps<br /><br />\n'Man with Bags' Sept. 14 through October 1. 8:30 pm,TSU<br /><br />\ndream while awake.

Although Airto had done some recording<br />\nfor Buddha, the resultant success of Light As A Feather<br />\nnetted him a contract with CTI, and it was this<br />\nconnection that first brought Airto's uniquely Brasilian<br />\njazz to the attention of American listeners.<br />\nAirto's first album for CTI was a star-studded<br />\nextravagance which showed off Creed Taylor's stable<br />\nbetter than it did Airto's music. Although the presence of<br />\nChick Corea, Joe Farrell, Stanley Clarke and other<br />\nassorted jazz \"names\" may have added to the sales, they<br />\ndid nothing for the music. In fact, Free (CTI 6020) is<br />\nrather like one of those candy samplers, where some of<br />\nthe nuggets are tantalizing yet unfulfilling while others<br /><br />\nseem mere filler.<br />\nDiscounting Free and Virgin Land (a half-hearted<br />\nattempt at funk, which Taylor shuffled off to his<br />\nSalvation label), Airto's CTI recordings show a real<br />\ndevelopment in his attempt to fuse jazz and Brasilian<br />\nmusics. Fingers (CTI 6028) stands as perhaps Airto's<br />\nfinest album, and it also acted as the foundation for OPA<br />\nas well as a standard for Flor Purirh's sessions as a leader.<br />\nPerhaps the prime example of the album's fusion of the<br />\ntwo is Hugo Fattoruso's Parana. Although the head is<br />\nkind of jazzy in its own way, the improvisation is upon a<br />\nsimple one-chord rhythm vamp. The first soloist is Airto,<br />\nwho scats and finally drifts into some wonderfully<br />\nrhythmic Portuguese lyrics. Although there is no<br />\nindication that the lyrics were part of the song, the<br />\nnaturalness of their flow would imply a sort of<br />\npre-existence; yet they carry a sense of spontaneity<br />\ncharacteristic of an improvised riff. Jon Hendricks in<br />\nPortuguese?<br />\nRegardless, the vocalisation is placed against Hugo<br />\nFattoruso playing a piano solo (which he whistles along<br />\nwith). Both the colours and the texture of the solos carry<br />\nan indigenous, South American flavour, while the use of<br />\nmodes and turn-arounds indicate a strong jazz scbooling.<br />\nWhat one is left with, then, is not jazz with Brasilian<br />\neffects, as in the old Stan Getz samba spectaculars, but<br />\njazz that is also Brasilian music.<br />\nOf course, the album showed other aspects of Airto<br />\nand his band. his sense of lyricism (\"San Francisco<br />\nRiver\"), his ability to play odd meters with a formidable<br /><br />\nChaplain to give<br />\nOur Daily Bread<br />\nBY MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nKing Vidor's Our Daily Bread (1934), to be shown at<br />\nthe Reel World this Sunday at 7:30 p.m., has much in<br />\ncommon with an earlier Vidor film, The Crowd (1928),<br />\nbecause it stated, through the unemployment and social<br />\ninsignificance of its hero, John, that the \"Coolidge<br />\nprosperity\" was not benefitting all segments of society. In<br />\nThe Crowd Vidor implied that the capitalist system, based<br />\non competition, not cooperation, ignored the common<br />\nman. Unfortunately, the common man ignored The<br />\nCrowd and it was a box-office failure.<br />\nNeither MGM's Irving Thalberg nor any other studio<br />\nwould touch Vidor's idea, because, as Vidor complained<br />\nin the September 1934 issue of New Theatre : \"The final<br />\ndecisions are made by business men, not artists,\" and the<br />\nHollyw000d businessmen had not forgotten the financial<br />\nfailure of The Crowd. \"I was left with the alternative,\"<br />\nwrote Vidor, \"to raise the money and make the picture<br />\nmyself.\" Withthe support of Charles Chaplin he was able<br />\nto obtain loans and finance his project.<br />\nVidor's struggle to film Our Daily Bread is probably<br />\nmore impressive than the film itself. The opening credits<br />\ntell us that \"Headlines of Today\" were the basis for Our<br />\nDaily Bread's plot, and certainly the first few scenes,<br />\nwhere John, unemployed,is unable to pay the rent, are an<br />\naccurate depiction of what life was like, for millions of<br />\npeople in 1934. John concludes, along with Vidor, that<br />\nmoving back to the land is \"the only answer\" to the<br />\nDepression. When John moves from the city to. a farm<br /><br />\nsense of swing (\"Tomba in 7/4\"), and his ability to<br />\nconceive and achieve a studio sense of sound which<br />\ndoesn't sterilize the music (\"fingers\").<br />\nUnfortunately, there was a break in Airto's recorded<br />\noutput, due in large part to the imprisonment of his wife<br />\nFlora Purim. Because Flora had the misfortune to be in<br />\nthe same apartment with a cocaine user when that<br />\napartment was raided, she was arrested and charged with<br />\npossession. Despite repeated testimony that Flora was not<br />\na user, and certainly not involved, she was placed in<br />\nprison after having been found guilty of possession.<br />\n(Perhaps this, when compared to the light sentence<br />\nreceived by Louise Lasser for possession, would serve as<br />\nadequate example of the levels and degrees of American<br />\ncourt justice.)<br />\nUp to that time, Flora had released her first two<br />\nalbums as a solo act, and was quickly gaining notice as<br />\none of America's foremost jazz singers. Working with such<br />\njazz stalwarts as Joe Henderson, George Duke, Miroslav<br />\nVitous and Stanley Clarke, Flora was moving in an<br />\nelectric-jazz direction, not quite rock, but not Ella<br />\nFitzgerald either.<br />\nWhen she gained her freedom, she returned to the<br />\nstudio, and took a much more elctronic direction. her<br />\nalbums became more studio oriented, and even though<br />\nthey still included Airto, guitarist David Amaro and<br />\nHermetto Pascoal, they did not carry the heavily Brasilian<br />\nflavor of Airto's albums. Open Your Eyes You Can Fly<br />\n(Milestone 9065) walked the thin line between jazz-rock<br />\nand commercial jazz pop. In fact, if it were not for the<br />\nexcellence of the studio musicians (among them Ron<br />\nCarter, George Duke and Al Johnson), the album could<br />\nhave slipped into the commercial dreck featuied on Flor's<br />\nfirst Warner Brothers album.<br />\nWhile all this was going on, Airto had begun to record<br />\nagain, this time for Arista. His first album, Identity<br />\n(Arista 4068), featured most of the same people his CTI<br />\nalbums had used, in addition to Herbie Hancock and<br />\nWayne Shorter.<br />\nShorter had become interested in Brasilian jazz in the<br />\n(Super<br />\nlate sixties, and his last albums for Blue Note<br />\nbits<br />\ncarried<br />\nIska)<br />\nof<br />\nNova, Moto Grosso Feio, Odyssey<br />\nColumbia<br />\nfirst<br />\nhis<br />\nwas<br />\nit<br />\nBut<br />\nand pices of Brasilian music.<br />\npoint<br />\nalbum, Native Dancer(PC- 33418), which drove the<br />\nhome. Using an all-star Brasilian-American cast, the album<br />\nincluded Airto, Amaro, Hancock, and Shorter as well as<br />\nMilton Nascimento and his organist Wagner Tiso, Roberto<br />\nSilva(who later joined Airto's band), and others.<br />\nAlthough Shorter and Hancock were only cameo<br />\nplayers on Identity, their presence gave the movement<br />\ncredibility, a live session at Montreux called Five Hundred<br />\nMiles High. (M-9070)' This album, featuring Airto,<br />\nRoberto, David Amaro, Wagner Tiso, Ron Carter, Pat<br />\nRebillot, and a walk on by Milton was the pinnacle of<br />\nnear the town of Arcadia, Vidor moves from town to<br />\ncountry as well: the often drab, neo-realistic style which<br />\ncharacterized his exploration of urban life in The Crowd<br />\nis replaced by a pastoral vision of life on a farm. \"There<br />\nmust be a lot of fellows in the same boat,\" muses John<br />\nduring a philosophic rest from his labors,\" and he<br />\nproposes \"a sort of cooperative where money isn't so<br />\nimportant...`You help me, I help you.\"<br />\nThe poor families of Our Daily Bread have been<br />\ncrushed by an economic depression, and the<br />\nabandonment of their own farms ,and towns, their<br />\nbanding together on a collective farm, is an explicit<br />\nrejection of their society, a society which in many ways<br />\nhas rejected them. Alternative forms of government,<br />\ndemocratic and socialistic, are dismissed without any real_<br />\ndebate, for literally every man present, no matter what his<br />\nbackground, concludes that the ideal form of government<br />\nis a dictatorship. John may be a benevolent dictator, but<br />\nsomehow the notion of communal sharing and ownership,<br />\nthe very notion which brought these people to the farm,<br />\nwould tend toward other than an autocratic form of<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nAnother major flaw is that when dissension arises in the<br />\ncommune it comes from outside rather than inside forces.<br />\nVidor somehow didn't seem to realize that most true<br />\ntensions and conflicts would result from within the<br />\ncommune itself, when the people themselves discovered<br />\nthe impossibility of completely sublimating their selfish,<br />\ncompetitive desires. There are a few people in the<br />\ncommune who occasionally step out of line and are<br />\npromptly punched out by ,John, but the real tensions in<br />\nthe commune result from two outside forces, a platinum<br />\nblonde and a drought.<br />\nEveryone finds a place in Vidor's new society: even a<br />\nviolinist finds employment, teaching the children; even<br />\nSally is put to work, taking inventory. These are dreamy,<br />\npastoral sections of the film, in which the tiny shacks, like<br />\nrustic doll houses, dot the Arcadian countryside. It's a<br /><br />\nFlora's jazz singing, and (remarkably) did not lose it's<br />\nsense of Brasil. The jazz-folk fusion was beconfing more<br />\nand more of a reality.<br />\nSo what happened now? Airto's last album,Promises of<br />\nthe Sun had its moments, but couldn't quite measure up<br />\nto the high standards of Fingers. His new album, I'm<br />\nFine,How Are You (to be reviewed in the future) doesn't<br />\nseem to be quite it either.<br />\nThe Fattoruso brothers, Jorge and Hugo, formed OPA<br />\nwith Ringo Thielman. All were part of the Fingers band,<br />\nwith David Amaro and Flora. Although their<br />\npiano-bass-drums format would imply a sense of<br />\ntraditional jazz, their electronic experiments do not work<br />\nout as such. \"Corre Nina\" on their first album, Golden<br />\nWings,(Milestone M-9069) carries a strong sense of what<br />\nthey could have done if only they concentrated their<br />\nefforts on direction. As for their current album, Magic<br />\nTime (Milestone M-9078), although it is a delightful burst<br />\nof energy, it's just a little too smugly electronic, too coyly<br />\ncomposed to seem genuine.<br />\nWhen it comes to selling out to demon dollar, the<br />\nall-time award must go to trombonist Raul de Souza.<br />\nAlthough he made his name as Brasil's Best Jazz<br />\nTrombonist by age 23, he has always seemed better suited<br />\nto background playing than lead spots. His technique is<br />\nalright, but without polish or precision (perhaps due to<br />\nhis preference for the half-bass trombone). His newest<br />\nalbum, Sweet Lucy, is outrageously commercial, which<br />\nalthough not a sin in itself, proves to be a waste of both<br />\nthe liste er's and t e \u2022la ers' time.<br /><br />\nRaul de Souza lacks the brash, ballsy funk of, say, Dave<br />\nBargeron, or the super-slick slidework of Bill Watrous. His<br />\nstyle is best suited to a fluid, lyrical-line, Which is fine for<br />\nBrasilian music. But if you insist on getting down, for<br />\nGod's sake do it right.<br />\nOn the whole, though, the signs are good for more<br />\n,\u2022 ,ake its way to our sunny shores. With both<br />\nBrasilian to(<br />\nc with mega-bucks Warner Brothers (a.k.a.<br />\nAirto and Fioc,<br />\nthe people,who brought you George Benson, Superstar),<br />\nsomeone in the industry sees a market for the stuff.<br />\nHopefully, not only is it there, but it will ask for better<br />\nthan the handouts it is currently receiving.<br />\n--J. D. Considine<br />\nfantasy so utterly appealing that even though we know it<br />\nto be false we want to believe it, want to assent when a<br />\ncharacter says, \"There's nothing for people to worry<br />\nabout, not when they've got the earth.\"<br />\nThe earth, though, dries out, and John finally realizes<br />\nthat the only hope of saving the crop is to dig an<br />\nirrigation ditch three or four miles to the river.<br />\nThematically, Vidor -concludes Our Daily Bread with an<br />\nexternal force, a drought, being overcome by a<br />\ncommunity effort: every man digging and swinging picks,<br />\nevery woman holding a torch over her man when the<br />\nwork goes on into the night. There is a great cheer and<br />\ndancing in the mud once the water flows, and an idyllic,<br />\nflasliforward closing shot of IharvestL time. Cinematically,<br />\nthe irrigation ditch sequence, which contains practically<br />\nno dialogue, is an extremely Powerful and memorable<br />\nexperience.<br />\nThat final sequence, one of the most admired in<br />\nAmerican cinema, and the touching might-have-been<br />\natmosphere of the entire film, are perhaps the main<br />\nreasons why Our Daily Bread is still shown and discussed<br />\ntoday, but in 1934 what might have been a nationaltopic<br />\nof conversation wasn't, and the Film, like The Crowd<br />\nbefore it, was a box-office failure.<br />\nThe Hearst press, as might be expected, called it<br />\n\"pinko,\" but the leftist press was equally harsh: The<br />\nNation called it a \"travesty...the familiar enough attempt<br />\nof the liberal mind to reconcile the hope of a small<br />\ncollectivist unit with an acceptance of...capitalist<br />\nsociety,\" and The New Masses described Vidor as a<br />\n\"Hollywood anarchist with an inherent sympathy for the<br />\nunderdog,\" but went on to criticize his \"undeveloped<br />\npolitical understanding.\"<br />\nBy way, perhaps, of a consolation prize,because of the<br />\ncritical and popular approval which it failed to receive,<br />\nthe League of Nations awardedOur Daily Bread a gold<br />\nmedal, but Vidor, hurt in the pocket and probably in the<br />\nheart as well, soon returned to the Hollywood fold.<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE FREE UNIVERSITY<br />\nFAR 1977<br />\nThe Baltimore Free University is a non-profit, non-partisan volunteer<br />\norganization which seeks to provide an open educational forum for the exchange<br />\nof skills, information, and ideas within a flexible non-graded structure.

If you have a skill, some<br />\nknowledge, or an interest that you would like to share with others,<br />\nconsider becoming a Free University Instructor. The basic qualification to<br />\nteach in the Free University is the ability to help others learn a specific<br />\nsubject. One's life experiences are important, and academic qualifications<br />\nare not necessarily a requirement.<br />\nCall Jim Case at 338-8187 or write Baltimore Free University, Office of<br />\nthe Chaplain, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. 21218 to explore<br />\nthis opportunity further.<br />\nNote:for insurance reasons, the Baltimore Free University can assume no<br />\nliability for outdoor type activities.

Though fighting<br />\nwith mock swords and wooden shileds, the combatants<br />\nflail away at each other with unbounded enthusiasm. The<br />\nduels aren't all fun and games. A blow from one of those<br />\nhard wood swords, which are weighted to accurately<br />\nsimulate a real sword, delivered by an experienced hand,<br />\ncan leave a painful bruise. (I know -- I have several of<br />\nthem already).<br />\nBut if one isn't particularly interested in fighting with<br />\nsword and shield (though the impulse to don armor and<br />\nhelmet is almost_ irresistible), one can always try being a<br />\nmagician, juggler, court jester, bard, squire, alchemist,<br />\nyeoman, or even a simple peasant -- if you like tilling soil.<br />\nIn fact, the SCA encourages people to join who are<br />\ninterested in most anything about the Middle Ages. If one<br />\nhas ever been thinking about the days when bold gents<br />\nand fair ladies made their own music, candles, and<br />\nentertainment, when feasts were held to rouse the spirit<br />\nand empty the mead tankard, this is the clu b to join.<br />\nWhy do people from our modern technological society<br />\nwish to go back in time to the days of King Arthur or<br />\nHenry VIII? After all, the common man of today lives<br />\nbetter than the richest King ever did a thousand years ago.<br />\nWhat is it about the Middle Ages that stirs the imagination<br />\nof the members to actually attempt to simulate the days<br />\nof yore?<br />\nThe answers may surprise you: they surprised me. The<br />\nSCA is not attempting to simulate the Dark Ages, which is<br />\nan ominous and revealing title to one of our most<br />\nmisunderstood historical ages, but is, rather, trying to<br />\nshow the Middle Ages as they should have been. As one<br />\nmember put it,\"We don't want to reinstitute plague.\"<br />\nThe Dark Ages was a time of disease and war, a period<br />\nof both religious and political rigidity. These facets of the<br /><br />\nMiddle Ages arc remembered all too well by the textbook<br />\nreaders. What the SCA presents is the other side of the<br />\ngold piece: the music, arts, dancing, literature, poetry,<br />\nchivalry, feasts, jousts, and folklore of the years from 700<br />\nAD to roughly 1650 AD. Individual creativity, something<br />\ntoday 's industrialized common man sadly lacks,<br />\nflourished during the years of lords and castles, and it is<br />\nthis essence of creativity which the SCA wishes to capture<br />\nand expand upon.<br />\nIn case the reader should think that the SCA is a crew<br />\nof hopeless romantics centered in the Baltimore area, it<br />\nshould be known that the SCA is a nationwide one.<br />\nholding feasts, jousts, and other events periodically<br />\nthroughout the year. Two Kingdoms, the Eastern<br />\nKingdom and the Western Kingdom, compete between<br />\nthemselves for the lost glory of nights in shining armor<br />\nwinning damsels in distress. Sadly, there are no dragons<br />\nleft to fight on this world.<br />\nIn a sense, however, all SCA members are.incurably in<br />\nlove with the Age of Chivalry. A member gets to choose<br />\nhis or her own name, title, family history, etc. -- the only<br />\nlimit being that one cannot be named after a real person<br />\nor fictionalized character without permission, which is<br />\nslightly difficult in the former case. For those Tolkien,<br />\nMoorcock, or other fantasy readers, this is your chance to<br />\nbecome a part of the fantasy you always hoped you could<br />\nact out but never dared.<br />\nIf you insist on being a fighting man or woman,armor<br />\nis something of a problem. There are strict rules and<br />\nregulations as to what one can wear or must wear, set by<br />\nthe SCA higher echelons. To engage the Black Knight, I<br />\nhad to don armor which barely fit, a helm which almost<br />\ntore off my ears, hockey gloves for fist barding, elbow<br />\npads\u2018 which constantly fell off, and a leather knee pad<br />\nwhich really was meant to be a thigh pad. The only<br />\nadvantages my opponent had were superior training,<br />\nphysique, and armor.. I won't bore you with the trivial<br />\ndetails of how the fight progressed: suffice it to say that I<br />\nam burning with desire to avenge my honor...<br />\nTherefore, if you can peel yourself away from studying<br />\nfor a knight, come an,d see the SCA on _either the<br />\nFreshmen Quad or the field in front of Garland.

It's unfortunate, however,<br />\nbecause the team's strong finish last year in the Maryland<br />\nAthletic Conference year-end meet should be enough to<br />\nwarrant greater support from the Hopkins community.<br />\nTheir mediocre season in '76 was topped off by what the<br />\ncoach, Randy Cockey. called a big plus. Specifically, they<br />\nfinished third out of 17 schools in the MAC meet,having<br />\nbeen edged out of first by Gettysburg and Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall.<br />\nThis year the big competition seems to be F&amp;M,and a<br />\nnew threat, Ursinus. According to the ever optimistic<br />\ncoach, however, this year's season is already beginning to<br />\nlook good. \"Potentially, we have our best team this year.<br />\nIt's a matter of getting every runner at his best as far as<br />\nhis condition is concerned. My duty is to give suggestions,<br />\nrunning opportunities, and to set up the schedule. But<br />\nbasically, they're on their own.\"<br />\nThere is no significant change in the training schedule<br />\nthis year, although a change in the length of the 5.0 mile<br />\nrace to 6.1 miles or 10,000 meters has created a need for<br />\nlonger running during practices. Hopkins is already ahead<br />\nof the game here though, because the home course is 5.7<br />\nt miles, which gives Hopkins' runners an added edge. Right<br />\nnow, the team is in their \"long- run\" phase, and is not on<br />\nthe track at all. Although some runners are beginning to<br />\ndo speed work,-the remainder are running once or twice a<br />\nday for a total of up to twelve miles.<br />\nThe eventual varsity team of seven will include four<br />\nseniors.

This was Suesse's first assist in a<br />\nBlue Jay uniform since he was shifted from goalie to this<br />\noffensive position.<br />\nThe Hoyas countered a minute later when they caught<br />\nthe Jay defense sleeping and slipped a goal by George<br />\nCoutres, the new Blue Jay goaltender.<br />\nFrosh midfielder Carney scored what proved to be the<br />\nwinning tally late in the game when he fired a 25 foot<br />\nshot that went untouched by the Georgetown goalie into<br />\nthe bottom right-hand corner of the net.<br />\nThe Hoyas made it close in the waning moments when<br />\nthey put in their second goal. but it was not enough.<br />\nCoach Bob Oliver, who led the soccer team to a<br />\ndivision championship in 1975, is coming off a<br />\ndisappointing), 5-5-1 record but looks to improve on that<br />\nmark, especially in-division play. \"We looked real good<br />\ntoday,\" said the coach, \"Georgetown is a division one<br />\nteam and they always offer us good competition. I am<br />\nvery enthusiastic about the coming season. Even though<br />\nwe've lost some strength up the middle with the<br />\ngraduation of Tom Myrick and Gary Ignatowski, I think<br />\nwe may come close to filling their big shoes.\"<br />\nCo-captains Larry McGowan and Frank Olszewski, an<br />\nalternate on the U.S.i0lympic Soccer Team, should<br />\nprovide some veteran strength on offense and defense<br />\nrespectively.

This<br />\nis only the pick of the crop, however, and this year's<br />\ncross-country team has the largest turnout ever, with a<br />\nlarge number of freshmen opting for positions.<br />\nDavid Stewart, a freshman from Cherry Hill, New<br />\nJersey, is trying out for a team slot and is quite impressed<br />\nwith the caliber of the Hopkins program and its attitude<br />\ntoward sports and studies. \"The pressure of running<br />\ndepends largely on its program. The JHU program takes<br />\nthe academics into account and allows freedoms. You can<br />\nset your own pace and goals, and decide how hard you<br />\nwant to work.\" Stewart is one of about a half dozen<br />\nfreshman trying out for tile team. Because of the large<br />\nproportion of graduating seniors, the future success of the<br />\ncross- country team lies with these new additions.<br />\nThe selection process for the team differs from that of<br />\nother varsity sports. No one is ever cut from the roster.<br />\nBut because of room in the bus going to away races, only<br />\ntwelve runners are allowed to go to away meets. Coach<br />\nCockey explains that the selection process is dependent<br />\nupon finishing positions after the first race. \"For the first<br />\nrace, positions are assigned by me according to their times<br />\non the track and from watching them. After that, its all<br />\ndependant on how they do in that first race and in<br />\nsubsequent races.\"<br />\nThe amazing factor, though, behind the runners who go<br />\nout for cross- country is why they bother to run at all.<br />\nThere have never been fans turned away from a Hopkins<br />\nmeet, nor do the runners get the publicity that any of the<br />\nother sports receive on this campus. There is no great \"big<br />\nman on campus\" attitude toward anyone on the team<br />\nMost students probably do not even know that there is a<br />\nteam. Jim Kennedy, co-captain, feels that cross-country<br />\nrunners are not in the sport for the social side of it.<br />\nnot a grandstand sport. You don't run cross- country tc<br />\nrun socially. We have different goals.\"<br /><br />\nOther team members explain their love for the spor<br />\nthis way. \"You mainly look to improve your time<br />\nCertainly you want to do well for the team and win, bu<br />\nmostly you want self-improvement.\" Coach Cockey is<br />\nhoping for a larger support from fans this year. \"We never<br />\nturn fans away at a. race, and this year with the hint o<br />\nsuccess so imminant, we're hoping that people will turi<br />\nout more to see our team run.\"<br />\nWith the first cross-country race this Wednesday<br />\nSeptember 21 at Loyola, and the first home race.

Though Pfeffer is perhaps best known for his Marxist leanings, ideology is not the issue at this time. Nor, in fact, is the<br />\nPolitical Science Department,s decision not to award him the tenured position of full professor. Instead, the issue at hand is the Academic<br />\nCouncil,s refusal to appoint an ad hoc committee to review Pfeffer,s case more thouroughly.<br />\nIt is a fundamental tenet of the American and all other civilized systems ofjurisprudence that one is entitled to appeal a court decision<br />\nhe deems injust. Yet the Academic Council has denied Professor Pfeffer this right by rejecting his plea for an ad hoc committee<br />\ninvestigation. Thus, if Pfeffer was indeed the victim of bias and antagonism within his department, the Council has eliminated the<br />\npossibility of exoneration.<br />\nFurther evaluation of Pfeffer's candidacy for tenure, then, is not simply a professional question, but .a moral one as well. The<br />\ncontroversy over Pfeffer's scholarship has not been conclusively resolved, and in the interests of fairness, deeper consideration of the<br />\nmatter becomes imperative. We of the Student Council support an ad hoc committee investigation of Professor Pfeffer's record.<br />\nawid Cliesatzow<br />\nStudent Council President<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41231, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "634f2d65-4c0b-46b7-8c32-6758eda3553e", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14360-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14360, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "e204357c-b7c0-47a2-bfe3-04b5f7e97d03", "url": "/node/14360"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "c4167b10-abe7-47a7-a298-39b7c2b535be"}]}
