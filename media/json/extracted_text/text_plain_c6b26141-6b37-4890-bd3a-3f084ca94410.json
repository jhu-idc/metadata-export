He has also<br />\nwritten several books including<br />\nWhat's So Funny About Science.<br />\nHis works have been on display<br />\nat the Smithsonian Museum of<br />\nScience, and can be seen now at<br />\nthe Maryland Science Center.<br />\nHarris began the lecture by<br />\nshowing a variety of his cartoons,<br />\nsupplementing them with anecdotes. Many of his cartoons are<br />\nabout science. In one, a man falling from a building recites the<br />\nformula for velocity and keeps<br />\nfalling, then says the formula for<br />\nlift and is lifted upward.<br />\nIn another, two scientists are<br />\ntalking. \"Unfortunately this lab<br />\nis funded only by as much gold<br />\nas we can make from bismuth,\"<br />\nsays one. Harris occasionally gets<br />\nhis ideas from real life. In this<br />\ncase, Harris was inspired by a<br />\nquotation from a scientist who<br />\nsaid, \"We spend more time getting grants than doing research.\"<br />\nHarris also showed some of his<br />\ncartoons from Playboy, One<br />\nfeatured a well-built college<br />\nwoman with a scarlet letter A on<br />\nher chest, resembling a varsity<br />\nletter. She passes two guys and<br />\none says, \"I think Karen's letter<br />\nis for a real extracurricular<br />\nactivity.\"<br />\nIn some copies of Playboy, the<br />\nletter came out in green and blue,<br />\nruining the joke.<br />\nHarris received a few letters<br />\nconcerning his cartoon of a<br />\nnuclear power plant with the caption, \"Closed due to radiation<br />\n<br />\nleak. Will be open in 70,000<br />\nyears.\" An offended nuclear<br />\nscientist wrote Harris, complaining that the cartoon misinformed<br />\npeople and scared them. \"It<br />\namazes me how suddenly people<br />\ntake things so seriously it offends<br />\nthem,\" said Harris.<br />\nIn the second part of the lecture, Harris opened the floor for<br />\nquestions, during which he<br />\ndescribed the way he works, saying \"The ideas are the essential<br />\nthing, the pictures come second.\"<br />\nHe added, \"I liked writing, but<br />\nI had little aptitude for drawing.<br />\nI don't think of the characters as<br />\nbeing essential in the cartoons. I<br />\nguess I hit stereotypes.\"<br />\nThe day after he gets the ideas,<br />\nHarris thinks about them to pick<br />\nthe ones to illustrate. Looking<br />\nback at old captions gives Harris<br />\n<br />\nthe chance to choose the ones to<br />\nillustrate. \"It gives me something<br />\nto do tomorrow,\" he said.<br />\nOnce he begins drawing, each<br />\npicture takes less than an hour to<br />\ncomplete. He said he can draw<br />\nseveral in one day. He spoke of<br />\nhis difficulties in getting over the<br />\nobstacles of going to the bank, the<br />\ngrocery store, and eating lunch.<br />\nGenerally, he creates his ideas<br />\nin a systematic way for a whole<br />\nday. He goes through newspapers<br />\nfor ideas, and through science<br />\nmagazines to keep his scientific<br />\nknowledge.<br />\n\"Ideas don't usually just come<br />\nto me,\" he said, \"I'm generally<br />\nnot in the mood [to begin working] but I do it anyway.

Following the<br />\nusual procedure, the SAC executive board submitted a list of<br />\nthirty-two names to the SAC for<br />\napproval.<br />\nThe approved list was then sent<br />\nto the Student Council, where it<br />\nwas rejected on the grounds that<br />\nthe nomination process had not<br />\nbeen fair because of lack of<br />\npublicity.<br />\nHowever, because the list was<br />\nalready full, some names would<br />\nhave had to be removed in order<br />\nto add new ones. Therefore, the<br />\nSAC executive board chose to reopen nominations and create an<br />\nentirely new list.<br />\nAfter increasing publicity and<br />\naccepting new nominations, the<br />\nboard released a list of only fourteen names. Pan explained this<br />\nsurprising event, saying, \"The<br />\nexecutive board concluded that<br />\n<br />\nwe really couldn't draw the line<br />\nat thirty-some people. So, we narrowed the list to the very top<br />\ncandidates.\"<br />\nThe new list passed the SAC<br />\nand the Student Council with<br />\ngreater contention than the<br />\nprevious list. \"Several Student<br />\nCouncil members felt that it was<br />\nunfair that people who were<br />\nnominated on the first list and had<br />\ntheir hopes up were chopped off<br />\nthe second list,\" said Pan.<br />\nThe committee intends to avoid<br />\nthe problems of previous years by<br />\nmaking the Student Activities<br />\nAwards less political while retaining their validity.<br />\n\"We want the awards to be fair<br />\nand meaningful,\" Pan stated. \"If<br />\nadequate revision is impossible,<br />\nwe will recommend that the<br />\nawards be eliminated and a new<br />\nmethod of honoring graduating<br />\nseniors be found.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/3<br />\n<br />\nUniversity Opens Foreign Language Center<br />\nInstitute in D.C. to Investigate Possible Modes of Instruction<br />\nBy Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nNational<br />\nThe<br />\nForeign<br />\nLanguage Center, the University's new research institute and<br />\ncomponent of the School of Advanced International Studies in<br />\nWashington D.C., will attempt to<br />\nbring \"a more focused approach<br />\nto foreign language pedagogy,\"<br />\nsaid A. Ronald Walton, deputy<br />\ndirector of the center.<br />\nAccording to Walton, the<br />\ncenter is funded by the Ford<br />\nFoundation, the Exxon Foundation, and the Pew Memorial<br />\nTrust. It is headed by Richard<br />\nLambert, a<br />\ncomparative<br />\nsociology professor from the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, who<br />\nfor many years has been involved in language study.<br />\nThe center, said Walton, grew<br />\n<br />\nout of the desire to have a national<br />\nplace where \"language as<br />\nlanguage\" could be studied.<br />\n\"Other countries have foreign<br />\nlanguage policies,\" said Walton,<br />\n\"but the U.S. problem is that<br />\nthere is no clear choice as to a second language.\"<br />\nWalton said that Americans<br />\nmight, from their heritage, be<br />\ndrawn to the languages of Northern Europe. \"However, those<br />\nare not necessarily the languages<br />\nof the future.\" said Walton.<br />\n\"Japanese, Chinese, and the<br />\nAfrican languages are becoming<br />\nincreasingly important.\"<br />\nOn the other hand, Walton emphasized that French is certainly<br />\nimportant in Africa, and Spanish<br />\nis useful in this country as well<br />\nas in Latin America, with whom<br />\nthe U.S. does a great deal of<br />\n<br />\ntrade<br />\n<br />\nWalton said that there is lack of<br />\nempiricism in language teaching.<br />\nThe goals for the center involve<br />\ninvestigating \"how it might be<br />\npossible to better learn language<br />\nskills on the college level,\" said<br />\nWalton, but also include studying<br />\nlanguage teaching on the secondary and high school levels.<br />\nThe center will offer what<br />\nWalton termed \"experimental<br />\nlearning.\" While actual courses<br />\nwill not be taught, people will be<br />\ninvited to come to the center and<br />\nbe observed while they learn.<br />\n\"We plan to focus on the<br />\nlearner, and see where teaching<br />\nfits in,\" said Walton. \"New<br />\ntechnology like video discs and<br />\ninput devices are helpful, but not<br />\nefficient in the classroom. There<br />\nthe emphasis is on the unique ex-<br />\n<br />\nperience between teacher and student of conversational practice.\"<br />\nWalton said that there are three<br />\nprimary sectors where language<br />\nis being taught in the U.S.: in<br />\nacademia, in proprietary schools<br />\nsuch as Berlitz, and in the government. \"We hope to get a dialogue<br />\ngoing between all three,\" said<br />\nWalton, \"because each has<br />\nsomething to offer the other.\"<br />\nWalton said, \"We plan to<br />\ndevelop a network of people<br />\nacross the country, in government<br />\nas well as the private sector\" to<br />\nconduct the center's studies.<br />\n\"We'll ask that research papers<br />\nwhich have obvious relevance to<br />\nlanguage instruction and follow<br />\nthe center's guidelines be submitted,\" said Walton, \"and with<br />\ntask forces of scholars across the<br />\ncountry, we can see where<br />\n<br />\nresearch is most needed.\"<br />\nWalton said that the center,<br />\nwhich is still in its early stages,<br />\nwill be fully operational by this<br />\nsummer. It will occupy one floor<br />\nof a newly acquired Hopkins<br />\nbuilding on Massachusetts<br />\nAvenue.<br />\nAlready, the center has, with<br />\nthe Arab Language Department<br />\nof SAIS, co-sponsored a conference that focused on less commonly taught languages.<br />\n\"Scholars of all the languages<br />\nwere in agreement in that their<br />\nteaching needs were very<br />\n.similar,\" said Walton, \"It was a<br />\ngreat success.\"<br />\nRalph B.

Coalition<br />\nmembers later removed the debris of the<br />\nmost provocative structures ever erected<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nIt is certainly a credit to the community that the shanties met their demise<br />\nunder the onslaught of Nature rather<br />\nthan at the hands of men.<br />\nBeyond the immediate political<br />\nsignificance of the shanties in the debate<br />\nover divestment, the structures came to<br />\nsymbolize the University's commitment<br />\nto freedom of expression.<br />\nBoth the shanties and those who built<br />\nthem endured considerable abuse from<br />\nmany sides in defending the right to<br />\nfreedom of expression, but they were<br />\nable to withstand the rough treatment<br />\nand prevail. For that, all members of the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins community should be proud.<br />\nNow the shanty era has come to a<br />\npeaceful end. While the Coalition has<br />\nnot yet achieved all of its goals, it has<br />\nwon the most important battle here at<br />\nHopkins\u2014the battle for freedom of<br />\nexpression.<br />\nIt's time now to move forward and to<br />\nleave the shanties behind as symbols of<br />\nthe victory for freedom of expression.<br />\nTo reconstruct the shanties would be<br />\nto dilute their symbolic significance by<br />\nmaking them much too mundane. The<br />\nCoalition would do well instead to expand its symbolic repertoire in keeping<br />\nwith its expanding interest in social injustice here in Baltimore and abroad.<br />\nPeaceful protests for social change<br />\nshould always be provocative, creative<br />\nand unpredictable. Clinging to past<br />\nglories and past symbols is almost a sure<br />\nrecipe for descent into obscurity.<br />\nWe hope that the Coalition will<br />\ncarefully reconsider its rumored plans<br />\nfor the construction of new shanties.<br />\nThe Coalition needs a new symbol and<br />\na new rallying cry, not a return to the<br />\ndays of last year.<br />\n<br />\nValentine Vacuum<br />\nSo it's Friday.

By refusing to<br />\napprove any SAC Seal list or by<br />\ntabling discussion of such a list<br />\nindefinitely, Council could \"club<br />\nthe Seals to death.\"<br />\n<br />\nEgo-Serving Statement<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn October, Dean Robert<br />\nWelch gave 3 reasons for the<br />\nslow development of the AM carrier station. To refresh the minds<br />\nof those interested, I'll repeat<br />\nthem.<br />\n1. Low Student interest: This<br />\nmay be debatable, but [recent]<br />\npetitions circulated during various<br />\nlectures do not prove anything<br />\nbeyond a doubt, because they<br />\nhave high duplication rates and no<br />\nstudent ID listings or even Social<br />\nSecurity numbers to lend<br />\nauthenticity.<br />\n2. High Cost Overhead: The<br />\ncheapest plan would be a closed<br />\ncircuit carrier system available to<br />\nlisteners in University buildings<br />\nand apartments. Student Council<br />\nconcluded that it would cost at<br />\nleast ten thousand dollars for installation and two thousand every<br />\nyear thereafter, not allowing for<br />\ndepreciation or inflation.<br />\nRemember that there are 2300<br />\nundergraduates and 1000 grad<br />\nstudents attending Hopkins, about<br />\n875 upperclassmen and grad<br />\nstudents, living off-campus in<br />\nUniversity-owned housing, and<br />\nabout 750 freshmen on campus.<br />\nThis station will reach less than<br />\nhalf of the student body.<br />\n3. Programming Overlap:<br />\nWell, I know there is plenty of<br />\nroom in Baltimore for good colleg radio\u2014for any good radio\u2014<br />\nbut the station under consideration will be AM! To avoid<br />\noverlap, programming will be of<br />\nnecessarily limited appeal. As an<br />\n[November 211 editorial said, \"It<br />\nis even more difficult to believe<br />\nthat anyone would want to spend<br />\ncountless hours broadcasting to a<br />\nhandful of listeners at best.\"<br />\nIt is true that $10,000 can be<br />\nwell spent here at Hopkins; on<br />\nsocial life, expanding the range of<br />\nthe escort van system, on repairing the pool rable at Levering and<br />\nthe foos tables in AMR II, on kitchen utensils like pots and pans<br />\nfor Buildings A and B, the<br />\nlightbulb on the gateway up on<br />\nUniversity Parkway (but since<br />\nlate September), touch-football<br />\nflags for the BIA, cartoons for the<br />\nWeekend Wonderflicks, and<br />\nmany other things, like salt instead of dirt for snow melting.<br />\nMr. Lerner, you described the<br />\neditorial printed almost three<br />\nmonths ago as inaccurate and illadvised.

Two weeks ago, I<br />\nhad my second such encounter of<br />\nthe year, and whereas on the first<br />\noccasion I avoided entering into<br />\na conversation, this time I found<br />\nmyself more pliant, and thus<br />\ncame to learn of [the couple's]<br />\nplight to \"better the world,<br />\nestablish a true democratic<br />\ngovernment for the people and<br />\nruled by the people, and rid society of all its unnecessary ills,<br />\nnuclear race, pollution, crimes,<br />\netc.. . .\"At the time, this sounded utopic at worst and I saw that<br />\nthe man was obviously engrossed in wishful thinking that he<br />\nhoped to lure me into. I began to<br />\nedge off and, yet, ventured to ask<br />\nhim what really was his disenchantment with the present society which seemed to me<br />\nreasonably democratic. He<br />\nanswered by complaining that<br />\n<br />\ndemocracy had left them out and country had no need for such peowas engaged in discrete and silent ple and so trodded away with the<br />\noppression.

University<br />\nemployees have an obligation to<br />\nthe people paying their salaries<br />\n(all of us students) to treat all<br />\nstudents with respect and<br />\ncourtesy; and the employee<br />\nshould immediately apologize to<br />\nthe student who was verbally<br />\nassaulted or else resign.<br />\nLloyd S.

Blue Key officer Shiv Chopra insists \"It's a<br />\nlot of fun! \u2014 I'm serious!\" as if<br />\nhe's addressing a very skeptical<br />\nlistener. \"The only problem with<br />\nbeing an officer,\" Shiv says, \"is<br />\nthat you give less tours. One<br />\nsemester I only went to 20 to 30<br />\n\u2022percent of my classes, but I came<br />\non campus just to give tours\u2014<br />\nthey were the highlight of my<br />\nweek!\" Chopra is an extremely<br />\ndedicated and enthusiastic Blue<br />\nKey member to be sure (he's<br />\ngiven up to 3 tours in one day!),<br />\nbut the great thing about Blue Key<br />\nis that everyone who's a part of<br />\nit seems to share Chopra's enthusiasm. Of one of his more recent tours, Anil Hari said \"It's<br />\nthe only reason I'd be out in a<br />\nblizzard.\" Anil was lucky enough<br />\nto give a tour on the first day of<br />\nregistration this semester, during<br />\nthe snowstorm that covered<br />\nBaltimore\u2014and he loved it! Jordan Karp also says he loves giving tours. \"I get to show off my<br />\nenthusiasm for Hopkins to prospective students\u2014you finally<br />\nhave a receptive audience who's<br />\nvery interested in what you have<br />\nto say.\"<br />\nBlue Key Vice President<br />\nDavid Charles says \"It's great<br />\nbeing the first link when prospective students come to visit. I think<br />\neveryone in Blue Key has a<br />\npositive attitude about Hopkins<br />\nand really enjoys being here.\"<br />\nCharles also remarks that the people in Blue Key are all very<br />\ndiverse.

Kathy<br />\nKennedy insists that the only<br />\nreason she joined Blue Key was<br />\nbecause giving tours would give<br />\nher more people to tell her jokes<br />\nto. Chopra says the best thing<br />\nabout Blue Key is that \"you get<br />\ntaken out to lunch by nice people<br />\nyou gave tours to.\" Sounds like<br />\n<br />\nfun, doesn't it? And the best part<br />\nof it is that while you're having<br />\nfun, you're helping the university in an important way.<br />\nBlue Key President Mandy<br />\nBusch, says that the basic goal of<br />\nBlue Key is twofold. First, the<br />\nBlue Key Society exists to provide a service for the University,<br />\nwhich distinguishes it from other<br />\norganizations. Blue Key Staff<br />\nCoordinator Bill Dean says that<br />\nBlue Key \"functions as a support<br />\ngroup for the Admissions Office.<br />\nIt's the closest thing to a spirit<br />\ngroup. These are people who<br />\nhave a very upbeat attitude about<br />\nHopkins that they convey to prospective students.\" Busch maintains, however, that Blue Key is<br />\nan \"independent entity from the<br />\nAdmissions Office.\" Students in<br />\nBlue Key are not required to say<br />\nanything, she notes. \"We encourage students to talk about the<br />\npositive and negative aspects of<br />\nHopkins\u2014to temper praise with<br />\nfrank, honest comments. We<br />\ndon't want them to present the<br />\nbad as awful, but rather present<br />\nit in a way that makes the good<br />\nbelievable.\"<br />\nThe second goal of the Blue<br />\nKey Society is to serve as a social<br />\norganization on campus that will<br />\npromote community at Hopkins.<br />\nBlue Key holds 3 or 4 social<br />\nevents a semester, such as<br />\nduckpin bowling or movie night.<br />\nBusch says her \"personal mis-<br />\n<br />\nsion\" is to make Blue Key more<br />\nsocial. She commented that the<br />\nnewer members of the club tend<br />\nto participate in the social events,<br />\nand she sees Blue Key as becoming more social. This semester ice<br />\nskating, a basketball game at the<br />\nCap Center, a lacrosse road trip,<br />\nand a potluck faculty dinner are<br />\nall possible upcoming social<br />\nsuch social activities, however.<br />\nBlue Key members also work on<br />\n\"telephoning\"\u2014a process in which<br />\nHopkins students telephone certain accepted high school seniors<br />\nBlue Key Society, however, is<br />\nnot limited to the 35 regular tours<br />\ngiven weekly, special tours, and<br />\nsuch social activities, however.<br />\nBlue Key members also work on<br />\n\"telephoning\" a process in which<br />\nHopkins students telephone certain accepted high school seniors<br />\nthat the Admissions Office has<br />\ntargeted, and they tell them a little about Hopkins and answer<br />\nquestions.

Spoon River Anthology was written by Edgar Lee<br />\nMasters, based on actual<br />\ncharacters from Masters'<br />\nhometown of Spoon River, Illinois. It appeared as poetic<br />\nmonologues in 1915, and was arranged for performance over 45<br />\nyears later.<br />\nProducer/Director Gerry<br />\nthe<br />\nedited,<br />\nre-arranged<br />\nmonologues, and inserted musical<br />\ninterludes to create an unusual<br />\nelegy for a small town. It is now<br />\n72 years after the poems first appeared, and Spoon River no<br />\nlonger exists in Illinois; it exists<br />\nin the imagination as a cry from<br />\nthe grave, a warning to the living, a picture of death, of sex,<br />\nand of dreams crushed by the<br />\nrealities of small town life.<br />\nThe Barnstormers have always<br />\nworked best as an ensemble, and<br />\nthis is an ensemble piece if ever<br />\nthere was one. Five actors\u2014Rich<br />\nBigelow, Airnie Hunt, Kathy<br />\nKennedy, Louis Kleiman and<br />\nVince LiCata\u2014assume over fifty<br />\ncharacters, an impressive feat for<br />\nstudent theater at Hopkins, where<br />\none role is often too much.

The<br />\nprogram announced Haydn's<br />\n\"Sunrise\" Quartet, Janacek's<br />\n\"Intimate Letters\" quartet (-2),<br />\nand Dvorak's quartet in A flat,<br />\nop. 105. There was a slight<br />\nchange to the program, though.<br />\nAt the very beginning of the concert, first violinist Brestislav<br />\nNovotny announced that instead<br />\nof Haydn's \"Sunrise\" quartet,<br />\nthe ensemble would play Haydn's<br />\nquartet op. 54, -2.

It is<br />\nbrooding, then whimsical; moping, then dancing. Dvorak, along<br />\nwith Smetana, is recognized as<br />\none of the founders of Czech Na-<br />\n<br />\ntional music. However, Dvorak<br />\nwrote this quartet rather late in<br />\nlife, with all of his major works<br />\nbehind him. He was much more<br />\ninterested at this point in synthesizing his national music with<br />\ncontemporary European music.<br />\nFor form and technical models,<br />\nhe looked to the music of<br />\nBrahms. The contrasts of mood<br />\nand tempo by the Prague Quartet<br />\nwere superb. They made the<br />\npiece, though full of contrasts,<br />\nseem organic. It is easy to hear<br />\nwhy their interpretation is becoming the \"classic statement in the<br />\nrepertory\", according to the New<br />\nYork Times. The perfectly matched tones and emotion of the<br />\nquartet made it a truly outstanding<br />\nand satisfying performance.<br />\nThe applause at the end of the<br />\nDvorak went on and on. The<br />\nquartet was called back three<br />\ntimes to the stage for additional<br />\nbows.

Oski of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical Institutions presented the third talk in<br />\nthe 1986-87 William Henry<br />\nWelch Lecture Series to an<br />\noverflow crowd in the Garrett<br />\nRoom of the Eisenhower Library<br />\nlast week. His talk, \"Pediatrics:<br />\nThe Only Medical Discipline with<br />\na Future\" dealt with a wide host<br />\nof issues that physicians and<br />\npublic health officials in the U.S.<br />\nare dealing with, most prominently the high national infant<br />\nmortality rate and the medical<br />\nproblems asssociated with the increasing amount of children being born in proverty.<br />\nDr. Oski began his lecture<br />\nciting the great advances the U.S.<br />\nhas made in the longevity of its<br />\ncitizens. In 1900, according to<br />\nOski, only 4% of the population<br />\nwas over the age of 65 and this<br />\npercentage continued to grow to<br />\nreach a figure of 11% today. By<br />\nthe year 2000, Oski expects that<br />\nnumber to be 13%, and be 2025,<br />\nsenior citizens are expected to account for a full 20% of the<br />\n<br />\npopulation. The lesser known<br />\nfact, however, is that the life expectancy of a 40-year old has not<br />\nincreased much over the last century. A 40-year old in 1900 could<br />\nexpect to live to 73, his counterpart today could expect to reach<br />\n77.<br />\n\"Such figures show,\" said<br />\nOski, \"that the numbers reflect a<br />\ndecrease in the number of immature deaths: the neonatal<br />\n(fatalities), the inherited diseases,<br />\naccidents, and infectious<br />\ndiseases.\" Though Dr. Oski attributes the decrease in immature<br />\ndeaths to improvements in nutrition, water quality, antibiotics,<br />\nand disease prevention, he maintains that the pediatrician was<br />\noften the guiding force behind<br />\nthose improvements. The importance of good health care at an<br />\nearly age was emphasized again<br />\nand again by Oski and finally<br />\nsummarized in the statement,<br />\n\"the future of American health is<br />\nin the hands of pediatricians.\"<br />\nThough health care in general<br />\nhas improved in the United States<br />\nand Dr. Oski forsees a day when<br />\nthe average life expectancy of<br />\n<br />\nAmericans at birth will be around<br />\n85, the problem of infant mortality is still a pressing one. Presently<br />\nthe rate is 18.4 deaths per<br />\n100,000 births, not a very respectable number considering the extensiveness of our hospital and<br />\nmedical system. Most industrialized nations including<br />\nnearly all of Europe have lower<br />\nrates. The most shocking statistic,<br />\nhowever, is that the infant mortality rate among certain groups<br />\nsuch as inner-city blacks is<br />\nastronomically high, a blight on<br />\nour medical system, according to<br />\nDr. Oski.<br />\nThe infant mortality rate among<br />\nblacks in Baltimore city now<br />\nstands at 59.5 deaths per<br />\n100,000, many times higher than<br />\nthe rate for whites, and higher<br />\nthan the rate of many developing<br />\ncountries such as Costa Rica or<br />\nPanama. Dr. Oski cited alcohol<br />\nand drug abuse, poor food selection, and the highest teen<br />\npregnancy rate in the nation as<br />\nreasons why Baltimore has the<br />\nfourth highest rate of infant mortality in the country.<br />\nTurning to lighter topics, Dr.<br />\n<br />\nA Future in Gene Therapy<br />\nBy Ely Brown<br />\nThe world of medicine and<br />\nscience is filled with questions<br />\nand problems to which there may<br />\nor may not be answers. The<br />\npublic has questions of their own<br />\nand for very obvious reasons it is<br />\ninterested in what breakthroughs<br />\nor stumbling blocks are occurring in the field today. 'The<br />\nPublic Interest in Science\" is a<br />\nfive-part series that is being<br />\npresented here at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity and strives to inform<br />\npeople from the community about<br />\ncurrent topics in the scientific<br />\nfield.<br />\nThe first of the lectures was<br />\npresented Wednesday, February<br />\n4 in Mudd Lecture Hall at 8 p.m.<br />\nThe topic was \"Genetic<br />\nEngineering and Gene Therapy\"<br />\nand speeches were given by<br />\nTheodore Friedman, MD, and<br />\nLeRoy Walters. The lecture<br />\ncovered the technical aspects as<br />\nwell as the ethical ones which can<br />\nbe intensely controversial when<br />\ndiscussing this touchy subject.<br />\nGenetic engineering and gene<br />\ntherapy theoretically can be used<br />\nby doctors and scientists in four<br />\ndistinct ways. The first is in the<br />\ntreatment of diseases directly<br />\nupon the afflicted cells involved,<br />\nbut it is possible to also use<br />\ngenetic engineering on the germ<br />\ncells so as to prohibit the continuation of the disease through<br />\nreproduction. Another way is to<br />\nuse genetic therapy in the<br />\n\"enhancement of capabilities\" or<br />\ncharacteristics of the person involved. Again, treatment can be<br />\non the somatic or reproductive<br />\ncells depending on the desired<br />\noutcome.<br />\nThe main purpose of gene<br />\ntherapy is to restore damaged<br />\nDNA in the cells of an organism<br />\nin order to bring about physical<br />\nchanges in the body. By repairing a gene, one can correct the<br />\nproteins and enzymes that it pro-<br />\n<br />\nduces and this will ultimately lead<br />\nto morphological changes in the<br />\norganism.<br />\nThere are currently four techniques that are being explored by<br />\nscientists to \"repair\" the genes.<br />\nOne way is to correct stagnant<br />\ngenes by activating them with<br />\ndrugs. Genetic errors are often<br />\nfound in the order of the nucleic<br />\nacids that make up the DNA<br />\nstrand, and therefore scientists<br />\nare trying to correct these errors<br />\nby either removing the incorrect<br />\nportion and replacing it with a<br />\nfunctional part or by inserting the<br />\ncorrect acids over the inoperative<br />\nones and in essence \"sewing<br />\nover\" the error. These latter two<br />\npossible techniques seem to be<br />\nimpossible to bring about, but the<br />\nfinal method, that of gene addition, seems to have significant<br />\npossibilities.<br />\nIn gene addition, the main idea<br />\nis to insert a functional strand of<br />\nDNA into a nonfunctional one.<br />\nThe major problem with the other<br />\ntechniques is that the technology<br />\nfor the necessary procedures does<br />\nnot exist today. However, with<br />\ngene addition, scientists have<br />\ntaken advantage of viruses as a<br />\nway to bring about the changes<br />\nneeded in the DNA strand.<br />\nViruses, by their very nature, add<br />\ntheir own DNA to our DNA in<br />\nour genes and this technique is<br />\nhow they bring harm to the<br />\norganism. Scientists are trying to<br />\ncreate viruses that will carry the<br />\ncorrect DNA strand into the cell<br />\nand add it to the gene in order to<br />\ncorrect the problem. However,<br />\nstumbling blocks still exist in this<br />\ntheory, the biggest being having<br />\nlittle or no control over the placement of the added strand.<br />\nThere are well over 3000<br />\nknown genetic disorders that<br />\ncould theoretically be corrected<br />\nwith gene therapy. Few people<br />\nhave problems accepting this<br />\nidea, but the use of gene therapy<br />\nfor enhancing or increasing<br />\n<br />\ncharacteristics seems to raise<br />\nethical questions. Increasing the<br />\nheight of an extremely short person is fine, but what about increasing the height of a basketball<br />\nplayer so that he would have a<br />\nbetter chance of making the pros?<br />\nAs with steroids today, gene<br />\ntherapy in the future could cause<br />\nheated controversy in the athletic<br />\nworld.<br />\nCompetitiveness, destructiveness, and territoriality are all<br />\ncharacteristics that are present in<br />\neach and every human, and<br />\nalthough they may not be the<br />\nmost positive ones we possess,<br />\nthey are part of what defines<br />\nhuman nature, and do scientists<br />\nhave the right to employ gene<br />\ntherapy to \"correct\" us? Today,<br />\ngene therapy is for the most part<br />\ncontained in the laboratory and<br />\nused on rats and other lab<br />\nanimals. But, one day, gene<br />\ntherapy may become part of our<br />\neveryday lives and when it does<br />\nmany ethical questions will have<br />\nto be solved.<br />\nThe public needs to be informed of the breakthroughs occurring in science today if they're expected to help solve these problems in the future. This lecture<br />\nseries, presented by the Program<br />\nin Science and Writing in the<br />\nWriting Seminars and the Student<br />\nCouncil, aims to present the<br />\npublic with just this type of information. Although two speakers<br />\nwill be presented at each lecture,<br />\nit is not a debate, but rather a way<br />\nto present different facets of the<br />\nsame topic to the public and to<br />\nallow them to make their own<br />\njudgments. Other topics include<br />\nhuman evolution, \"The Descent<br />\nof Man\" to be presented on<br />\nWednesday, February 18;<br />\n\"AIDS\" on Wednesday, March<br />\n4; \"Women in Science\" on<br />\nWednesday, April 1; and<br />\n\"Science and Dissent in the<br />\nSoviet Union\" on Wednesday,<br />\nApril 15.<br />\n<br />\nOski did a little back-patting and to have an effect on children, acgave the audience a few facts cording to Dr. Oski.

White Athletic Center. The<br />\nJays had control of this one most<br />\nof the way, at one point leading<br />\nby 20. The score at the half was<br />\nin Hopkins' favor, 39-24. Frosh<br />\nPaul Heiss, whose tenacious<br />\ndefense and strong rebounding<br />\nhave given him a starting opportunity, sunk 7. Senior captain<br />\nChris Wasson led all scorers with<br />\na game-high 19, while Mike<br />\nLatimore dropped in 18 and added 9 rebounds. Joel Sieperski, a<br />\n6'8\" frosh who has shown rapid<br />\ndevelopment under Coach<br />\nNelson, helped the cause with 15<br />\n<br />\npoints.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were not as fortunate in the beginning of the<br />\nweek when they faced much<br />\nstronger opposition. Last Saturday, Hopkins faced Widener,<br />\nwho holds first place in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast Division and is ranked<br />\nNo. 3 in Division III. Widener<br />\n(17-2, 7-0) acquired a 22 point<br />\nlead by the end of the half, 32-10.<br />\nThe Jays scored a season-low 40<br />\npoints in this contest with the final<br />\nbeing 56-40. Soph Jedan Phillips<br />\nled Hopkins with 13 and Chris<br />\nWasson followed with 9.<br />\nEmory University which, along<br />\nwith Hopkins, recently gained admission to the newly formed<br />\nUniversity Athletic Association,<br />\nvisited the Athletic Center for the<br />\nfirst time last Monday night.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins led this one by nine with<br />\n13:40 remaining. Paul Damm of<br />\nEmory scored seven consecutive<br />\npoints cutting the lead to 62-60.<br />\nLatimore's bucket, with 8:29 left,<br />\nshowed the Jays ahead 71-67.<br />\nDamm then sunk 3 in a row, including 2 three-point attempts.<br />\nThe final was Emory 90, Hopkins<br />\n82. Damm led all scorers on this<br />\nnight, dropping 28, 24 of which<br />\nwere in the second half. Senior<br />\nChris Wasson led the scoring attack for the Jays with 26, and<br />\nJedan Phillips dropped 21.<br />\nThe Jays go away this Saturday<br />\nto Widener, and come back home<br />\nMonday to play Ursinus at 8 p.m.<br />\nWednesday night the Blue Jays<br />\nplay their final home game this<br />\nseason against Haverford at 8<br />\np.m.<br />\n<br />\nHustling Jays Cover Spread<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\nLast November 24, the JV<br />\nbasketball team travelled to Cecil<br />\nCommunity College for their<br />\nseason opener. For many of the<br />\nplayers on the team, it was not<br />\nonly the first game of the season,<br />\nit was the first organized basketball game they had ever played<br />\nin. Most of the Blue Jays didn't<br />\nknow what to expect, and those<br />\nwho did expected the worst.<br />\nWell, that's exactly what they<br />\ngot, as Cecil slam-dunked their<br />\nway to a 107-37 victory. That's<br />\nright, Hopkins was defeated by<br />\n70 points.<br />\nThe best part about losing your<br />\nopener by 70 is that things can only get better. Gradually, the Blue<br />\nJays improved to the point where<br />\nthey were competetive in just<br />\nabout every game they played. A<br />\nmere two weeks after losing to<br />\nCecil, Hopkins came within four<br />\npoints of their first victory in two<br />\nyears. The very next day, they<br />\ncame even closer, dropping to<br />\nPenn State (Ogontz) by a score of<br />\n56-54. Despite this drastic turnaround, all they had to show for<br />\ntheir efforts on January 26 was an<br />\n0-6 record.<br />\nFinally, the Blue Jays shook the<br />\nmonkey off of their backs on<br />\nJanuary 27, as they defeated<br />\nMessiah. After that, Hopkins<br />\ndemonstrated their improvement<br />\nby extremely tough playing in<br />\nlosses to Navy and Howard Community College. By last Monday,<br />\nthe JV team had shown that they<br />\ncould play solid basketball. They<br />\nhad proven to their coach and to<br />\ntheir \"faithful few\" fans that<br />\nwhat they lacked in talent, they<br />\nmade up for with guts and hustle. They could finally walk away<br />\nfrom their season with a feeling<br />\nof great accomplishment, for they<br />\nhad regained the pride that they<br />\nhad lost on November 24. It<br />\nwould seem that Hopkins had<br />\nnothing left to prove as they<br />\nentered their final game of the<br />\nseason last Monday at Homewood. Their opponent, however,<br />\nwas Cecil Community College.<br />\nCecil once again dominated<br />\nwith their quickness, using a fullcourt press and a great inside<br />\n<br />\ngame to crush the Jays 87-37. But<br />\nthis game wasn't the same as the<br />\nNovember 24 thrashing. There<br />\nwere no slam dunks, no three-onone breakaways, and no chuckles<br />\nfrom the Cecil bench. Though<br />\nHopkins lost by 50, they walked<br />\naway with a victory. They outhustled the Seahawks, and made<br />\nCecil work for every basket. The<br />\nBlue Jays showed more guts.<br />\nIt's difficult to single out individuals for outstanding improvement, because everyone on<br />\nthe team has come a long way.<br />\nFreshman Tim Coyle has become<br />\na good inside player, grabbing rebounds with authority and drawing fouls in key situations. Brian<br />\n\"Sheep\" Tarver has coupled an<br />\noutstanding shot with great hustle.<br />\nSteve Blumenthal has become a<br />\nconsistent scoring machine, rack-<br />\n<br />\ning up three-pointers with ease.<br />\nMike Stern has developed into<br />\none of the finest rebounders on<br />\nthe team, simply by consistently<br />\nmuscling himself into the \"smart<br />\nspot.\"<br />\nIt's no secret that most of the<br />\nJV team played their final game<br />\nin a Hopkins basketball uniform<br />\nlast Monday night, because next<br />\nseason will probably see a drastic<br />\nchange in the quality of Hopkins<br />\nhoops. Coach Web Johnson did<br />\na tremendous job molding the<br />\nBlue Jays into a competitive unit.<br />\nHis team may not be the most<br />\ntalented in the world, but you'd<br />\nhae to look pretty hard to find a<br />\nteam with more guts than the<br />\nHopkins JV basketball team.<br />\nThey've come a long way since<br />\nNovember 24.<br />\n<br />\nSign up for Army ROTC Basic<br />\n<br />\nCamp.You'll get six weeks of<br />\nchallenges that can build up your<br />\nleadership skills as well as your<br />\nbody.You'll also get almost $700.<br />\nBut hurry.This summer may be<br />\nyour last chance to graduate from<br />\ncollege with a degree and an officer's<br />\ncommission.

He's resourceful<br />\nand full of initiative. He has a<br />\ndignity of voice, but does not suggest any pompousness. He works<br />\nas part of the team, has an<br />\nunderstanding of the game, the<br />\nplayers, and the coaches, and he<br />\nknows what the rules say and\u2014<br />\neven more importantly\u2014what<br />\nthey mean.<br />\nAnother thing fans who grab<br />\nfor the newspaper the morning<br />\nafter the game should understand:<br />\nThe officials are not, under any<br />\nconditions, to ever speak to the<br />\nnews media\u2014that is, the<br />\nnewspapers, TV or radio\u2014<br />\nofficials must make no statement<br />\nto them.

The Quizmaster is here to wish all of you lovedstarved Hoppies a Happy Valentines Day. Love is in the air, along with the influenza virus. This<br />\nweek's quiz concerns the former, and is a chance for the more sophisticated among you to show off<br />\nyour talents. Originally there was going to be one topic, that being Write About Your First Love, but<br />\nthat has changed. Now you have a choice. You can write about the aforementioned, or simply explain<br />\nWhy Valentines Day Sucks. Entries should contain at least three words (One for each of last week's<br />\nentires), and there is no limit as to how long you can ramble. You may wish to turn your entry into<br />\na poem, as The Quizmaster has a soft spot in his heart for poetry. And if you remember the last winner of an essay type quiz made a valiant attempt at poetry. Actually, all of the entries that week were<br />\npoems, but I never get tired of reading all one of them. Let's try to get more entries this week. If<br />\nnot, the 01' QM will have to earn his keep and won't be fable to write bogus quizzes when he has<br />\nother more pressing things to do. So cuddle up to your loved one, and remember if you don't have<br />\na loved one you always have Uncle Miltie, and the QM as well. Get your Entries to the News-Letter<br />\nBrothel (a.k.a. Acropolis, jadis le Chalet, ne Gatehouse) by February 18, at 5pm. Good health, and<br />\ngood sex!<br />\n<br />\nResults: Three, count'em three whole entries. And to top it off, only two of them came from the<br />\nsame address. What an improvement. 300%. I can see why Harvard wants to buy us. Just think, if<br />\nwe go Ivy there may be 5 entries next week. But lets get back to the task at hand. The winner of<br />\nlast week's quiz is Brian Tarver. Congratulations. Come by the Brothel during business hours, and<br />\npick up your prize. The answers were: 1-f, 2-i, 3-d, 4-j, 5-m, 6-r, 7-o, 815, 9-h, 10-a, 11-e, 12-b,<br />\n13-n, 14-g, 15-1, 16-q, 17-c, 18-k.

He has also<br />\nwritten several books including<br />\nWhat's So Funny About Science.<br />\nHis works have been on display<br />\nat the Smithsonian Museum of<br />\nScience, and can be seen now at<br />\nthe Maryland Science Center.<br />\nHarris began the lecture by<br />\nshowing a variety of his cartoons,<br />\nsupplementing them with anecdotes. Many of his cartoons are<br />\nabout science. In one, a man falling from a building recites the<br />\nformula for velocity and keeps<br />\nfalling, then says the formula for<br />\nlift and is lifted upward.<br />\nIn another, two scientists are<br />\ntalking. \"Unfortunately this lab<br />\nis funded only by as much gold<br />\nas we can make from bismuth,\"<br />\nsays one. Harris occasionally gets<br />\nhis ideas from real life. In this<br />\ncase, Harris was inspired by a<br />\nquotation from a scientist who<br />\nsaid, \"We spend more time getting grants than doing research.\"<br />\nHarris also showed some of his<br />\ncartoons from Playboy, One<br />\nfeatured a well-built college<br />\nwoman with a scarlet letter A on<br />\nher chest, resembling a varsity<br />\nletter. She passes two guys and<br />\none says, \"I think Karen's letter<br />\nis for a real extracurricular<br />\nactivity.\"<br />\nIn some copies of Playboy, the<br />\nletter came out in green and blue,<br />\nruining the joke.<br />\nHarris received a few letters<br />\nconcerning his cartoon of a<br />\nnuclear power plant with the caption, \"Closed due to radiation<br /><br />\nleak. Will be open in 70,000<br />\nyears.\" An offended nuclear<br />\nscientist wrote Harris, complaining that the cartoon misinformed<br />\npeople and scared them. \"It<br />\namazes me how suddenly people<br />\ntake things so seriously it offends<br />\nthem,\" said Harris.<br />\nIn the second part of the lecture, Harris opened the floor for<br />\nquestions, during which he<br />\ndescribed the way he works, saying \"The ideas are the essential<br />\nthing, the pictures come second.\"<br />\nHe added, \"I liked writing, but<br />\nI had little aptitude for drawing.<br />\nI don't think of the characters as<br />\nbeing essential in the cartoons. I<br />\nguess I hit stereotypes.\"<br />\nThe day after he gets the ideas,<br />\nHarris thinks about them to pick<br />\nthe ones to illustrate. Looking<br />\nback at old captions gives Harris<br /><br />\nthe chance to choose the ones to<br />\nillustrate. \"It gives me something<br />\nto do tomorrow,\" he said.<br />\nOnce he begins drawing, each<br />\npicture takes less than an hour to<br />\ncomplete. He said he can draw<br />\nseveral in one day. He spoke of<br />\nhis difficulties in getting over the<br />\nobstacles of going to the bank, the<br />\ngrocery store, and eating lunch.<br />\nGenerally, he creates his ideas<br />\nin a systematic way for a whole<br />\nday. He goes through newspapers<br />\nfor ideas, and through science<br />\nmagazines to keep his scientific<br />\nknowledge.<br />\n\"Ideas don't usually just come<br />\nto me,\" he said, \"I'm generally<br />\nnot in the mood [to begin working] but I do it anyway. I don't<br />\ngenerally wait for inspiration,<br />\nbecause this is a full-time job.\"<br /><br />\nSAC Seals Process<br />\nUnder Review After<br />\nPast Controversies<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br /><br />\nawards debate. Following the<br />\nusual procedure, the SAC executive board submitted a list of<br />\nthirty-two names to the SAC for<br />\napproval.<br />\nThe approved list was then sent<br />\nto the Student Council, where it<br />\nwas rejected on the grounds that<br />\nthe nomination process had not<br />\nbeen fair because of lack of<br />\npublicity.<br />\nHowever, because the list was<br />\nalready full, some names would<br />\nhave had to be removed in order<br />\nto add new ones. Therefore, the<br />\nSAC executive board chose to reopen nominations and create an<br />\nentirely new list.<br />\nAfter increasing publicity and<br />\naccepting new nominations, the<br />\nboard released a list of only fourteen names. Pan explained this<br />\nsurprising event, saying, \"The<br />\nexecutive board concluded that<br /><br />\nwe really couldn't draw the line<br />\nat thirty-some people. So, we narrowed the list to the very top<br />\ncandidates.\"<br />\nThe new list passed the SAC<br />\nand the Student Council with<br />\ngreater contention than the<br />\nprevious list. \"Several Student<br />\nCouncil members felt that it was<br />\nunfair that people who were<br />\nnominated on the first list and had<br />\ntheir hopes up were chopped off<br />\nthe second list,\" said Pan.<br />\nThe committee intends to avoid<br />\nthe problems of previous years by<br />\nmaking the Student Activities<br />\nAwards less political while retaining their validity.<br />\n\"We want the awards to be fair<br />\nand meaningful,\" Pan stated. \"If<br />\nadequate revision is impossible,<br />\nwe will recommend that the<br />\nawards be eliminated and a new<br />\nmethod of honoring graduating<br />\nseniors be found.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/3<br /><br />\nUniversity Opens Foreign Language Center<br />\nInstitute in D.C. to Investigate Possible Modes of Instruction<br />\nBy Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nNational<br />\nThe<br />\nForeign<br />\nLanguage Center, the University's new research institute and<br />\ncomponent of the School of Advanced International Studies in<br />\nWashington D.C., will attempt to<br />\nbring \"a more focused approach<br />\nto foreign language pedagogy,\"<br />\nsaid A. Ronald Walton, deputy<br />\ndirector of the center.<br />\nAccording to Walton, the<br />\ncenter is funded by the Ford<br />\nFoundation, the Exxon Foundation, and the Pew Memorial<br />\nTrust. It is headed by Richard<br />\nLambert, a<br />\ncomparative<br />\nsociology professor from the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, who<br />\nfor many years has been involved in language study.<br />\nThe center, said Walton, grew<br /><br />\nout of the desire to have a national<br />\nplace where \"language as<br />\nlanguage\" could be studied.<br />\n\"Other countries have foreign<br />\nlanguage policies,\" said Walton,<br />\n\"but the U.S. problem is that<br />\nthere is no clear choice as to a second language.\"<br />\nWalton said that Americans<br />\nmight, from their heritage, be<br />\ndrawn to the languages of Northern Europe. \"However, those<br />\nare not necessarily the languages<br />\nof the future.\" said Walton.<br />\n\"Japanese, Chinese, and the<br />\nAfrican languages are becoming<br />\nincreasingly important.\"<br />\nOn the other hand, Walton emphasized that French is certainly<br />\nimportant in Africa, and Spanish<br />\nis useful in this country as well<br />\nas in Latin America, with whom<br />\nthe U.S. does a great deal of<br /><br />\ntrade<br /><br />\nWalton said that there is lack of<br />\nempiricism in language teaching.<br />\nThe goals for the center involve<br />\ninvestigating \"how it might be<br />\npossible to better learn language<br />\nskills on the college level,\" said<br />\nWalton, but also include studying<br />\nlanguage teaching on the secondary and high school levels.<br />\nThe center will offer what<br />\nWalton termed \"experimental<br />\nlearning.\" While actual courses<br />\nwill not be taught, people will be<br />\ninvited to come to the center and<br />\nbe observed while they learn.<br />\n\"We plan to focus on the<br />\nlearner, and see where teaching<br />\nfits in,\" said Walton. \"New<br />\ntechnology like video discs and<br />\ninput devices are helpful, but not<br />\nefficient in the classroom. There<br />\nthe emphasis is on the unique ex-<br /><br />\nperience between teacher and student of conversational practice.\"<br />\nWalton said that there are three<br />\nprimary sectors where language<br />\nis being taught in the U.S.: in<br />\nacademia, in proprietary schools<br />\nsuch as Berlitz, and in the government. \"We hope to get a dialogue<br />\ngoing between all three,\" said<br />\nWalton, \"because each has<br />\nsomething to offer the other.\"<br />\nWalton said, \"We plan to<br />\ndevelop a network of people<br />\nacross the country, in government<br />\nas well as the private sector\" to<br />\nconduct the center's studies.<br />\n\"We'll ask that research papers<br />\nwhich have obvious relevance to<br />\nlanguage instruction and follow<br />\nthe center's guidelines be submitted,\" said Walton, \"and with<br />\ntask forces of scholars across the<br />\ncountry, we can see where<br /><br />\nresearch is most needed.\"<br />\nWalton said that the center,<br />\nwhich is still in its early stages,<br />\nwill be fully operational by this<br />\nsummer. It will occupy one floor<br />\nof a newly acquired Hopkins<br />\nbuilding on Massachusetts<br />\nAvenue.<br />\nAlready, the center has, with<br />\nthe Arab Language Department<br />\nof SAIS, co-sponsored a conference that focused on less commonly taught languages.<br />\n\"Scholars of all the languages<br />\nwere in agreement in that their<br />\nteaching needs were very<br />\n.similar,\" said Walton, \"It was a<br />\ngreat success.\"<br />\nRalph B.

Coalition<br />\nmembers later removed the debris of the<br />\nmost provocative structures ever erected<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nIt is certainly a credit to the community that the shanties met their demise<br />\nunder the onslaught of Nature rather<br />\nthan at the hands of men.<br />\nBeyond the immediate political<br />\nsignificance of the shanties in the debate<br />\nover divestment, the structures came to<br />\nsymbolize the University's commitment<br />\nto freedom of expression.<br />\nBoth the shanties and those who built<br />\nthem endured considerable abuse from<br />\nmany sides in defending the right to<br />\nfreedom of expression, but they were<br />\nable to withstand the rough treatment<br />\nand prevail. For that, all members of the<br /><br />\nHopkins community should be proud.<br />\nNow the shanty era has come to a<br />\npeaceful end. While the Coalition has<br />\nnot yet achieved all of its goals, it has<br />\nwon the most important battle here at<br />\nHopkins\u2014the battle for freedom of<br />\nexpression.<br />\nIt's time now to move forward and to<br />\nleave the shanties behind as symbols of<br />\nthe victory for freedom of expression.<br />\nTo reconstruct the shanties would be<br />\nto dilute their symbolic significance by<br />\nmaking them much too mundane. The<br />\nCoalition would do well instead to expand its symbolic repertoire in keeping<br />\nwith its expanding interest in social injustice here in Baltimore and abroad.<br />\nPeaceful protests for social change<br />\nshould always be provocative, creative<br />\nand unpredictable. Clinging to past<br />\nglories and past symbols is almost a sure<br />\nrecipe for descent into obscurity.<br />\nWe hope that the Coalition will<br />\ncarefully reconsider its rumored plans<br />\nfor the construction of new shanties.<br />\nThe Coalition needs a new symbol and<br />\na new rallying cry, not a return to the<br />\ndays of last year.<br /><br />\nValentine Vacuum<br />\nSo it's Friday.

To refresh the minds<br />\nof those interested, I'll repeat<br />\nthem.<br />\n1. Low Student interest: This<br />\nmay be debatable, but [recent]<br />\npetitions circulated during various<br />\nlectures do not prove anything<br />\nbeyond a doubt, because they<br />\nhave high duplication rates and no<br />\nstudent ID listings or even Social<br />\nSecurity numbers to lend<br />\nauthenticity.<br />\n2. High Cost Overhead: The<br />\ncheapest plan would be a closed<br />\ncircuit carrier system available to<br />\nlisteners in University buildings<br />\nand apartments. Student Council<br />\nconcluded that it would cost at<br />\nleast ten thousand dollars for installation and two thousand every<br />\nyear thereafter, not allowing for<br />\ndepreciation or inflation.<br />\nRemember that there are 2300<br />\nundergraduates and 1000 grad<br />\nstudents attending Hopkins, about<br />\n875 upperclassmen and grad<br />\nstudents, living off-campus in<br />\nUniversity-owned housing, and<br />\nabout 750 freshmen on campus.<br />\nThis station will reach less than<br />\nhalf of the student body.<br />\n3. Programming Overlap:<br />\nWell, I know there is plenty of<br />\nroom in Baltimore for good colleg radio\u2014for any good radio\u2014<br />\nbut the station under consideration will be AM! To avoid<br />\noverlap, programming will be of<br />\nnecessarily limited appeal. As an<br />\n[November 211 editorial said, \"It<br />\nis even more difficult to believe<br />\nthat anyone would want to spend<br />\ncountless hours broadcasting to a<br />\nhandful of listeners at best.\"<br />\nIt is true that $10,000 can be<br />\nwell spent here at Hopkins; on<br />\nsocial life, expanding the range of<br />\nthe escort van system, on repairing the pool rable at Levering and<br />\nthe foos tables in AMR II, on kitchen utensils like pots and pans<br />\nfor Buildings A and B, the<br />\nlightbulb on the gateway up on<br />\nUniversity Parkway (but since<br />\nlate September), touch-football<br />\nflags for the BIA, cartoons for the<br />\nWeekend Wonderflicks, and<br />\nmany other things, like salt instead of dirt for snow melting.<br />\nMr. Lerner, you described the<br />\neditorial printed almost three<br />\nmonths ago as inaccurate and illadvised.

According to Organization President<br />\nJeff Holmes, the squad's busiest<br />\ndays coincide with BIA events,<br />\nparticularly football and wrestling. The squad also provides first<br />\naid assistance each year at Spring<br />\nFair.<br />\nHolmes is proud of the squad's<br />\nresponse time-3 minutes on<br />\naverage.

If it weren't for you, they<br />\nwould have had to go by ambulance.

Blue Key officer Shiv Chopra insists \"It's a<br />\nlot of fun! \u2014 I'm serious!\" as if<br />\nhe's addressing a very skeptical<br />\nlistener. \"The only problem with<br />\nbeing an officer,\" Shiv says, \"is<br />\nthat you give less tours. One<br />\nsemester I only went to 20 to 30<br />\n\u2022percent of my classes, but I came<br />\non campus just to give tours\u2014<br />\nthey were the highlight of my<br />\nweek!\" Chopra is an extremely<br />\ndedicated and enthusiastic Blue<br />\nKey member to be sure (he's<br />\ngiven up to 3 tours in one day!),<br />\nbut the great thing about Blue Key<br />\nis that everyone who's a part of<br />\nit seems to share Chopra's enthusiasm. Of one of his more recent tours, Anil Hari said \"It's<br />\nthe only reason I'd be out in a<br />\nblizzard.\" Anil was lucky enough<br />\nto give a tour on the first day of<br />\nregistration this semester, during<br />\nthe snowstorm that covered<br />\nBaltimore\u2014and he loved it! Jordan Karp also says he loves giving tours. \"I get to show off my<br />\nenthusiasm for Hopkins to prospective students\u2014you finally<br />\nhave a receptive audience who's<br />\nvery interested in what you have<br />\nto say.\"<br />\nBlue Key Vice President<br />\nDavid Charles says \"It's great<br />\nbeing the first link when prospective students come to visit. I think<br />\neveryone in Blue Key has a<br />\npositive attitude about Hopkins<br />\nand really enjoys being here.\"<br />\nCharles also remarks that the people in Blue Key are all very<br />\ndiverse. They kind of represent<br />\n\"all walks of Hopkins life,\" he<br />\nsays.<br />\nIndeed, the individuality of the<br />\nBlue Key members was evident in<br />\nsome of their comments alone.<br />\nNot everyone has the standard \"I<br />\nlove giving tours\" remark. Kathy<br />\nKennedy insists that the only<br />\nreason she joined Blue Key was<br />\nbecause giving tours would give<br />\nher more people to tell her jokes<br />\nto. Chopra says the best thing<br />\nabout Blue Key is that \"you get<br />\ntaken out to lunch by nice people<br />\nyou gave tours to.\" Sounds like<br /><br />\nfun, doesn't it? And the best part<br />\nof it is that while you're having<br />\nfun, you're helping the university in an important way.<br />\nBlue Key President Mandy<br />\nBusch, says that the basic goal of<br />\nBlue Key is twofold. First, the<br />\nBlue Key Society exists to provide a service for the University,<br />\nwhich distinguishes it from other<br />\norganizations. Blue Key Staff<br />\nCoordinator Bill Dean says that<br />\nBlue Key \"functions as a support<br />\ngroup for the Admissions Office.<br />\nIt's the closest thing to a spirit<br />\ngroup. These are people who<br />\nhave a very upbeat attitude about<br />\nHopkins that they convey to prospective students.\" Busch maintains, however, that Blue Key is<br />\nan \"independent entity from the<br />\nAdmissions Office.\" Students in<br />\nBlue Key are not required to say<br />\nanything, she notes. \"We encourage students to talk about the<br />\npositive and negative aspects of<br />\nHopkins\u2014to temper praise with<br />\nfrank, honest comments. We<br />\ndon't want them to present the<br />\nbad as awful, but rather present<br />\nit in a way that makes the good<br />\nbelievable.\"<br />\nThe second goal of the Blue<br />\nKey Society is to serve as a social<br />\norganization on campus that will<br />\npromote community at Hopkins.<br />\nBlue Key holds 3 or 4 social<br />\nevents a semester, such as<br />\nduckpin bowling or movie night.<br />\nBusch says her \"personal mis-<br /><br />\nsion\" is to make Blue Key more<br />\nsocial. She commented that the<br />\nnewer members of the club tend<br />\nto participate in the social events,<br />\nand she sees Blue Key as becoming more social. This semester ice<br />\nskating, a basketball game at the<br />\nCap Center, a lacrosse road trip,<br />\nand a potluck faculty dinner are<br />\nall possible upcoming social<br />\nsuch social activities, however.<br />\nBlue Key members also work on<br />\n\"telephoning\"\u2014a process in which<br />\nHopkins students telephone certain accepted high school seniors<br />\nBlue Key Society, however, is<br />\nnot limited to the 35 regular tours<br />\ngiven weekly, special tours, and<br />\nsuch social activities, however.<br />\nBlue Key members also work on<br />\n\"telephoning\" a process in which<br />\nHopkins students telephone certain accepted high school seniors<br />\nthat the Admissions Office has<br />\ntargeted, and they tell them a little about Hopkins and answer<br />\nquestions. Telephoning occurs<br />\nearly in April, and the Admissions Office usually targets accepted students in the humanities<br />\nand social sciences in order to<br />\nexplain to them that Hopkins is a<br />\ngood place for them too.<br />\nBlue Key also coordinates<br />\novernight housing for prefreshmen.

Spoon River Anthology was written by Edgar Lee<br />\nMasters, based on actual<br />\ncharacters from Masters'<br />\nhometown of Spoon River, Illinois.

It is now<br />\n72 years after the poems first appeared, and Spoon River no<br />\nlonger exists in Illinois; it exists<br />\nin the imagination as a cry from<br />\nthe grave, a warning to the living, a picture of death, of sex,<br />\nand of dreams crushed by the<br />\nrealities of small town life.<br />\nThe Barnstormers have always<br />\nworked best as an ensemble, and<br />\nthis is an ensemble piece if ever<br />\nthere was one. Five actors\u2014Rich<br />\nBigelow, Airnie Hunt, Kathy<br />\nKennedy, Louis Kleiman and<br />\nVince LiCata\u2014assume over fifty<br />\ncharacters, an impressive feat for<br />\nstudent theater at Hopkins, where<br />\none role is often too much.

The<br />\nprogram announced Haydn's<br />\n\"Sunrise\" Quartet, Janacek's<br />\n\"Intimate Letters\" quartet (-2),<br />\nand Dvorak's quartet in A flat,<br />\nop. 105. There was a slight<br />\nchange to the program, though.<br />\nAt the very beginning of the concert, first violinist Brestislav<br />\nNovotny announced that instead<br />\nof Haydn's \"Sunrise\" quartet,<br />\nthe ensemble would play Haydn's<br />\nquartet op. 54, -2.

It is<br />\nbrooding, then whimsical; moping, then dancing. Dvorak, along<br />\nwith Smetana, is recognized as<br />\none of the founders of Czech Na-<br /><br />\ntional music. However, Dvorak<br />\nwrote this quartet rather late in<br />\nlife, with all of his major works<br />\nbehind him. He was much more<br />\ninterested at this point in synthesizing his national music with<br />\ncontemporary European music.<br />\nFor form and technical models,<br />\nhe looked to the music of<br />\nBrahms. The contrasts of mood<br />\nand tempo by the Prague Quartet<br />\nwere superb. They made the<br />\npiece, though full of contrasts,<br />\nseem organic. It is easy to hear<br />\nwhy their interpretation is becoming the \"classic statement in the<br />\nrepertory\", according to the New<br />\nYork Times. The perfectly matched tones and emotion of the<br />\nquartet made it a truly outstanding<br />\nand satisfying performance.<br />\nThe applause at the end of the<br />\nDvorak went on and on. The<br />\nquartet was called back three<br />\ntimes to the stage for additional<br />\nbows.

The importance of good health care at an<br />\nearly age was emphasized again<br />\nand again by Oski and finally<br />\nsummarized in the statement,<br />\n\"the future of American health is<br />\nin the hands of pediatricians.\"<br />\nThough health care in general<br />\nhas improved in the United States<br />\nand Dr. Oski forsees a day when<br />\nthe average life expectancy of<br /><br />\nAmericans at birth will be around<br />\n85, the problem of infant mortality is still a pressing one. Presently<br />\nthe rate is 18.4 deaths per<br />\n100,000 births, not a very respectable number considering the extensiveness of our hospital and<br />\nmedical system. Most industrialized nations including<br />\nnearly all of Europe have lower<br />\nrates. The most shocking statistic,<br />\nhowever, is that the infant mortality rate among certain groups<br />\nsuch as inner-city blacks is<br />\nastronomically high, a blight on<br />\nour medical system, according to<br />\nDr. Oski.<br />\nThe infant mortality rate among<br />\nblacks in Baltimore city now<br />\nstands at 59.5 deaths per<br />\n100,000, many times higher than<br />\nthe rate for whites, and higher<br />\nthan the rate of many developing<br />\ncountries such as Costa Rica or<br />\nPanama. Dr. Oski cited alcohol<br />\nand drug abuse, poor food selection, and the highest teen<br />\npregnancy rate in the nation as<br />\nreasons why Baltimore has the<br />\nfourth highest rate of infant mortality in the country.<br />\nTurning to lighter topics, Dr.<br /><br />\nA Future in Gene Therapy<br />\nBy Ely Brown<br />\nThe world of medicine and<br />\nscience is filled with questions<br />\nand problems to which there may<br />\nor may not be answers. The<br />\npublic has questions of their own<br />\nand for very obvious reasons it is<br />\ninterested in what breakthroughs<br />\nor stumbling blocks are occurring in the field today. 'The<br />\nPublic Interest in Science\" is a<br />\nfive-part series that is being<br />\npresented here at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity and strives to inform<br />\npeople from the community about<br />\ncurrent topics in the scientific<br />\nfield.<br />\nThe first of the lectures was<br />\npresented Wednesday, February<br />\n4 in Mudd Lecture Hall at 8 p.m.<br />\nThe topic was \"Genetic<br />\nEngineering and Gene Therapy\"<br />\nand speeches were given by<br />\nTheodore Friedman, MD, and<br />\nLeRoy Walters. The lecture<br />\ncovered the technical aspects as<br />\nwell as the ethical ones which can<br />\nbe intensely controversial when<br />\ndiscussing this touchy subject.<br />\nGenetic engineering and gene<br />\ntherapy theoretically can be used<br />\nby doctors and scientists in four<br />\ndistinct ways. The first is in the<br />\ntreatment of diseases directly<br />\nupon the afflicted cells involved,<br />\nbut it is possible to also use<br />\ngenetic engineering on the germ<br />\ncells so as to prohibit the continuation of the disease through<br />\nreproduction. Another way is to<br />\nuse genetic therapy in the<br />\n\"enhancement of capabilities\" or<br />\ncharacteristics of the person involved. Again, treatment can be<br />\non the somatic or reproductive<br />\ncells depending on the desired<br />\noutcome.<br />\nThe main purpose of gene<br />\ntherapy is to restore damaged<br />\nDNA in the cells of an organism<br />\nin order to bring about physical<br />\nchanges in the body. By repairing a gene, one can correct the<br />\nproteins and enzymes that it pro-<br /><br />\nduces and this will ultimately lead<br />\nto morphological changes in the<br />\norganism.<br />\nThere are currently four techniques that are being explored by<br />\nscientists to \"repair\" the genes.<br />\nOne way is to correct stagnant<br />\ngenes by activating them with<br />\ndrugs. Genetic errors are often<br />\nfound in the order of the nucleic<br />\nacids that make up the DNA<br />\nstrand, and therefore scientists<br />\nare trying to correct these errors<br />\nby either removing the incorrect<br />\nportion and replacing it with a<br />\nfunctional part or by inserting the<br />\ncorrect acids over the inoperative<br />\nones and in essence \"sewing<br />\nover\" the error. These latter two<br />\npossible techniques seem to be<br />\nimpossible to bring about, but the<br />\nfinal method, that of gene addition, seems to have significant<br />\npossibilities.<br />\nIn gene addition, the main idea<br />\nis to insert a functional strand of<br />\nDNA into a nonfunctional one.<br />\nThe major problem with the other<br />\ntechniques is that the technology<br />\nfor the necessary procedures does<br />\nnot exist today. However, with<br />\ngene addition, scientists have<br />\ntaken advantage of viruses as a<br />\nway to bring about the changes<br />\nneeded in the DNA strand.<br />\nViruses, by their very nature, add<br />\ntheir own DNA to our DNA in<br />\nour genes and this technique is<br />\nhow they bring harm to the<br />\norganism. Scientists are trying to<br />\ncreate viruses that will carry the<br />\ncorrect DNA strand into the cell<br />\nand add it to the gene in order to<br />\ncorrect the problem. However,<br />\nstumbling blocks still exist in this<br />\ntheory, the biggest being having<br />\nlittle or no control over the placement of the added strand.<br />\nThere are well over 3000<br />\nknown genetic disorders that<br />\ncould theoretically be corrected<br />\nwith gene therapy. Few people<br />\nhave problems accepting this<br />\nidea, but the use of gene therapy<br />\nfor enhancing or increasing<br /><br />\ncharacteristics seems to raise<br />\nethical questions. Increasing the<br />\nheight of an extremely short person is fine, but what about increasing the height of a basketball<br />\nplayer so that he would have a<br />\nbetter chance of making the pros?<br />\nAs with steroids today, gene<br />\ntherapy in the future could cause<br />\nheated controversy in the athletic<br />\nworld.<br />\nCompetitiveness, destructiveness, and territoriality are all<br />\ncharacteristics that are present in<br />\neach and every human, and<br />\nalthough they may not be the<br />\nmost positive ones we possess,<br />\nthey are part of what defines<br />\nhuman nature, and do scientists<br />\nhave the right to employ gene<br />\ntherapy to \"correct\" us? Today,<br />\ngene therapy is for the most part<br />\ncontained in the laboratory and<br />\nused on rats and other lab<br />\nanimals. But, one day, gene<br />\ntherapy may become part of our<br />\neveryday lives and when it does<br />\nmany ethical questions will have<br />\nto be solved.<br />\nThe public needs to be informed of the breakthroughs occurring in science today if they're expected to help solve these problems in the future. This lecture<br />\nseries, presented by the Program<br />\nin Science and Writing in the<br />\nWriting Seminars and the Student<br />\nCouncil, aims to present the<br />\npublic with just this type of information. Although two speakers<br />\nwill be presented at each lecture,<br />\nit is not a debate, but rather a way<br />\nto present different facets of the<br />\nsame topic to the public and to<br />\nallow them to make their own<br />\njudgments.

White Athletic Center. The<br />\nJays had control of this one most<br />\nof the way, at one point leading<br />\nby 20. The score at the half was<br />\nin Hopkins' favor, 39-24. Frosh<br />\nPaul Heiss, whose tenacious<br />\ndefense and strong rebounding<br />\nhave given him a starting opportunity, sunk 7. Senior captain<br />\nChris Wasson led all scorers with<br />\na game-high 19, while Mike<br />\nLatimore dropped in 18 and added 9 rebounds. Joel Sieperski, a<br />\n6'8\" frosh who has shown rapid<br />\ndevelopment under Coach<br />\nNelson, helped the cause with 15<br /><br />\npoints.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were not as fortunate in the beginning of the<br />\nweek when they faced much<br />\nstronger opposition. Last Saturday, Hopkins faced Widener,<br />\nwho holds first place in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast Division and is ranked<br />\nNo. 3 in Division III. Widener<br />\n(17-2, 7-0) acquired a 22 point<br />\nlead by the end of the half, 32-10.<br />\nThe Jays scored a season-low 40<br />\npoints in this contest with the final<br />\nbeing 56-40. Soph Jedan Phillips<br />\nled Hopkins with 13 and Chris<br />\nWasson followed with 9.<br />\nEmory University which, along<br />\nwith Hopkins, recently gained admission to the newly formed<br />\nUniversity Athletic Association,<br />\nvisited the Athletic Center for the<br />\nfirst time last Monday night.<br /><br />\nHopkins led this one by nine with<br />\n13:40 remaining. Paul Damm of<br />\nEmory scored seven consecutive<br />\npoints cutting the lead to 62-60.<br />\nLatimore's bucket, with 8:29 left,<br />\nshowed the Jays ahead 71-67.<br />\nDamm then sunk 3 in a row, including 2 three-point attempts.<br />\nThe final was Emory 90, Hopkins<br />\n82. Damm led all scorers on this<br />\nnight, dropping 28, 24 of which<br />\nwere in the second half. Senior<br />\nChris Wasson led the scoring attack for the Jays with 26, and<br />\nJedan Phillips dropped 21.<br />\nThe Jays go away this Saturday<br />\nto Widener, and come back home<br />\nMonday to play Ursinus at 8 p.m.<br />\nWednesday night the Blue Jays<br />\nplay their final home game this<br />\nseason against Haverford at 8<br />\np.m.<br /><br />\nHustling Jays Cover Spread<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\nLast November 24, the JV<br />\nbasketball team travelled to Cecil<br />\nCommunity College for their<br />\nseason opener. For many of the<br />\nplayers on the team, it was not<br />\nonly the first game of the season,<br />\nit was the first organized basketball game they had ever played<br />\nin. Most of the Blue Jays didn't<br />\nknow what to expect, and those<br />\nwho did expected the worst.<br />\nWell, that's exactly what they<br />\ngot, as Cecil slam-dunked their<br />\nway to a 107-37 victory. That's<br />\nright, Hopkins was defeated by<br />\n70 points.<br />\nThe best part about losing your<br />\nopener by 70 is that things can only get better. Gradually, the Blue<br />\nJays improved to the point where<br />\nthey were competetive in just<br />\nabout every game they played. A<br />\nmere two weeks after losing to<br />\nCecil, Hopkins came within four<br />\npoints of their first victory in two<br />\nyears. The very next day, they<br />\ncame even closer, dropping to<br />\nPenn State (Ogontz) by a score of<br />\n56-54. Despite this drastic turnaround, all they had to show for<br />\ntheir efforts on January 26 was an<br />\n0-6 record.<br />\nFinally, the Blue Jays shook the<br />\nmonkey off of their backs on<br />\nJanuary 27, as they defeated<br />\nMessiah. After that, Hopkins<br />\ndemonstrated their improvement<br />\nby extremely tough playing in<br />\nlosses to Navy and Howard Community College. By last Monday,<br />\nthe JV team had shown that they<br />\ncould play solid basketball. They<br />\nhad proven to their coach and to<br />\ntheir \"faithful few\" fans that<br />\nwhat they lacked in talent, they<br />\nmade up for with guts and hustle. They could finally walk away<br />\nfrom their season with a feeling<br />\nof great accomplishment, for they<br />\nhad regained the pride that they<br />\nhad lost on November 24. It<br />\nwould seem that Hopkins had<br />\nnothing left to prove as they<br />\nentered their final game of the<br />\nseason last Monday at Homewood. Their opponent, however,<br />\nwas Cecil Community College.<br />\nCecil once again dominated<br />\nwith their quickness, using a fullcourt press and a great inside<br /><br />\ngame to crush the Jays 87-37. But<br />\nthis game wasn't the same as the<br />\nNovember 24 thrashing. There<br />\nwere no slam dunks, no three-onone breakaways, and no chuckles<br />\nfrom the Cecil bench. Though<br />\nHopkins lost by 50, they walked<br />\naway with a victory. They outhustled the Seahawks, and made<br />\nCecil work for every basket. The<br />\nBlue Jays showed more guts.<br />\nIt's difficult to single out individuals for outstanding improvement, because everyone on<br />\nthe team has come a long way.<br />\nFreshman Tim Coyle has become<br />\na good inside player, grabbing rebounds with authority and drawing fouls in key situations. Brian<br />\n\"Sheep\" Tarver has coupled an<br />\noutstanding shot with great hustle.<br />\nSteve Blumenthal has become a<br />\nconsistent scoring machine, rack-<br /><br />\ning up three-pointers with ease.<br />\nMike Stern has developed into<br />\none of the finest rebounders on<br />\nthe team, simply by consistently<br />\nmuscling himself into the \"smart<br />\nspot.\"<br />\nIt's no secret that most of the<br />\nJV team played their final game<br />\nin a Hopkins basketball uniform<br />\nlast Monday night, because next<br />\nseason will probably see a drastic<br />\nchange in the quality of Hopkins<br />\nhoops. Coach Web Johnson did<br />\na tremendous job molding the<br />\nBlue Jays into a competitive unit.<br />\nHis team may not be the most<br />\ntalented in the world, but you'd<br />\nhae to look pretty hard to find a<br />\nteam with more guts than the<br />\nHopkins JV basketball team.<br />\nThey've come a long way since<br />\nNovember 24.<br /><br />\nSign up for Army ROTC Basic<br /><br />\nCamp.You'll get six weeks of<br />\nchallenges that can build up your<br />\nleadership skills as well as your<br />\nbody.You'll also get almost $700.<br />\nBut hurry.This summer may be<br />\nyour last chance to graduate from<br />\ncollege with a degree and an officer's<br />\ncommission.

The Quizmaster is here to wish all of you lovedstarved Hoppies a Happy Valentines Day. Love is in the air, along with the influenza virus. This<br />\nweek's quiz concerns the former, and is a chance for the more sophisticated among you to show off<br />\nyour talents. Originally there was going to be one topic, that being Write About Your First Love, but<br />\nthat has changed. Now you have a choice. You can write about the aforementioned, or simply explain<br />\nWhy Valentines Day Sucks. Entries should contain at least three words (One for each of last week's<br />\nentires), and there is no limit as to how long you can ramble. You may wish to turn your entry into<br />\na poem, as The Quizmaster has a soft spot in his heart for poetry. And if you remember the last winner of an essay type quiz made a valiant attempt at poetry. Actually, all of the entries that week were<br />\npoems, but I never get tired of reading all one of them. Let's try to get more entries this week. If<br />\nnot, the 01' QM will have to earn his keep and won't be fable to write bogus quizzes when he has<br />\nother more pressing things to do. So cuddle up to your loved one, and remember if you don't have<br />\na loved one you always have Uncle Miltie, and the QM as well. Get your Entries to the News-Letter<br />\nBrothel (a.k.a. Acropolis, jadis le Chalet, ne Gatehouse) by February 18, at 5pm. Good health, and<br />\ngood sex!<br /><br />\nResults: Three, count'em three whole entries. And to top it off, only two of them came from the<br />\nsame address. What an improvement. 300%. I can see why Harvard wants to buy us. Just think, if<br />\nwe go Ivy there may be 5 entries next week. But lets get back to the task at hand. The winner of<br />\nlast week's quiz is Brian Tarver. Congratulations. Come by the Brothel during business hours, and<br />\npick up your prize. The answers were: 1-f, 2-i, 3-d, 4-j, 5-m, 6-r, 7-o, 815, 9-h, 10-a, 11-e, 12-b,<br />\n13-n, 14-g, 15-1, 16-q, 17-c, 18-k. There you have it, and that's all she wrote. Please, please, PLEASE<br />\nenter this week, if not I may give my space out to Sports next week, and you all know what an injustice it would be to put sports like ours on a back page.<br /><br />\n000000000000000000 STUDENT TALENT!!
