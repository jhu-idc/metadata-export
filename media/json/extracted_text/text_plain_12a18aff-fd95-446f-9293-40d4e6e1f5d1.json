So far this year the Student<br />\nCouncil has done little to correct this situation. They<br />\nhave presented one assembly, a talk by Dr. Eisenhower.<br />\nThis is fine, but it is about the extent of their efforts. The<br />\nChristmas assembly is the only one remaining on their<br />\nschedule, and that assembly is hardly a feather in their<br />\ncap, for it would be presented without the efforts of the<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nA lack of funds is not a legitimate excuse for the<br />\nSteve Zizmar (Stosh) and Tony Alfano (Shapiro) (left to right) salute Alan Crowly (a German<br />\ndearth of assemblies.

Since he assimilates knowledge slowly he is<br />\nconstantly seen assiduously attacking one volume on reserve. Consequently he roams to and fro, from reserve<br />\ndesk to home and back, toting the volume in his red<br />\nleatherette attache case, signing it out, not completing the<br />\nassignment, signing it out once more.<br />\nFor argument's sake let' us further suppose that the<br />\nday finally arrives when Victor V. finishes his assignment.<br />\nHe places the book in the desk drawer, falls fast asleep<br />\ndreaming of the truth which will set him free, and the<br />\nfollowing morning, full of 'joie de vivre,' Victor merrily<br />\ncarries his little red ,leatherette empty attache case to<br />\nschool. The forgotten volume of lore sits; Victor's classmates stew; the librarian frets;' the Honor Commission<br />\nacts.<br />\nOur setting: a room in Gilman Hall. Around the oak<br />\ndesk, lounged in leathered chairs, sit the members of the<br />\nr-Honor Commission. Victor Vincent cringes in some corner. A Commission member remarks that \"Mr. Liberabit<br />\nwas here once before because he 'forgot' to return a reserve<br />\nbook, and was convicted.\"<br />\n\"Why did you not return your reserve book, Victor<br />\nVincent?\". asks a Commission member.<br />\n\"I forgot,\" answers Victor V. \"I possess an incredibly<br />\ninept memory, atrocious reading comprehension, and am<br />\nconstantly seen assiduously attacking one volume on reserve.\"<br />\n\"We don't believe you, Victor Vincent. It is rather<br />\nhard to forget after once being punished, isn't it?\"<br />\n\"I forgot.\"<br />\n\"We don't believe you,\" says an Honor Commission<br />\nman. \"No man could 'forget' twice.\" The bodies in the<br />\nleathered chairs sway in agreement. Victor V. is led from<br />\nthe room. A vote is taken. The Verdict is guilty, the<br />\npenalty, expulsion.<br />\nVictor Vincent Liberabit leaves the room. His red<br />\nleatherette attache case bumps and drags down the stairs.<br />\n\"I forgot,\" says Victor V.<br />\nAnd he did.<br />\n<br />\nly shown Friday night in the<br />\nBarnstormers' presentation of<br />\nStalag 17 by Bevan and Tyranski. These abilities were enough<br />\nto bring off the popular'drama<br />\nof life in a World War II German prison camp with enough<br />\nemphasis on the really funny<br />\nscenes.<br />\nThe flair for comedy and<br />\ncharacterization which the first<br />\nyear men evidenced, combined<br />\nwith the constant and universal<br />\nappeal of this play, more than<br />\nmade up for technical shortcomings. Even the fact that various<br />\nmembers of the cast frequently<br />\nblew their lines and left uncomfortably silent gaps here and<br />\nthere in the action didn't really<br />\nmar the general effect they<br />\nachieved or cause the audience<br />\nto enjoy the play less.<br />\nVos Laudamus<br />\nSeveral members of the cast<br />\nparticularly deserve mention here<br />\nfor the big part they played in<br />\nthe success of the comedy: Bob<br />\nWibbelsman, Harald<br />\nPappas,<br />\nSteve Zizmare Tony Alfano, Dave<br />\nAdams and Bob Gray. When<br />\nthey remembered their material,<br />\nthey really made the most of it.<br />\nThe man most responsible for<br />\nmaking a success of Stalag 17,<br />\nhowever, was the director Dave<br />\nHochberg. His choice of cast was<br />\nbrilliantly appropriate, his staging generally expert, and his attention to detail decisive in realizing the humour and the drama<br />\nin every scene.<br />\nExcuses Noted In the final analysis, any failings on the boards Friday night<br />\nwere chiefly the result of the<br />\nshort time the cast had in which<br />\nto prepare the production, and<br />\nall involved deserve credit for<br />\ntheir verve and deftness.<br />\nFurthermore, if the cast hadn't<br />\nmade a success of the drama,<br />\nit is doubtful that some fifty<br />\npeople would have remained<br />\nstanding on every side throughout the play's three acts.<br />\n<br />\nkins Playshop, directed by Mrs.<br />\nFrances Bowen, this year will<br />\npresent three lectures and three<br />\nplays.

So far this year the Student<br />\nCouncil has done little to correct this situation. They<br />\nhave presented one assembly, a talk by Dr. Eisenhower.<br />\nThis is fine, but it is about the extent of their efforts.

Since he assimilates knowledge slowly he is<br />\nconstantly seen assiduously attacking one volume on reserve. Consequently he roams to and fro, from reserve<br />\ndesk to home and back, toting the volume in his red<br />\nleatherette attache case, signing it out, not completing the<br />\nassignment, signing it out once more.<br />\nFor argument's sake let' us further suppose that the<br />\nday finally arrives when Victor V. finishes his assignment.<br />\nHe places the book in the desk drawer, falls fast asleep<br />\ndreaming of the truth which will set him free, and the<br />\nfollowing morning, full of 'joie de vivre,' Victor merrily<br />\ncarries his little red ,leatherette empty attache case to<br />\nschool. The forgotten volume of lore sits; Victor's classmates stew; the librarian frets;' the Honor Commission<br />\nacts.<br />\nOur setting: a room in Gilman Hall. Around the oak<br />\ndesk, lounged in leathered chairs, sit the members of the<br />\nr-Honor Commission. Victor Vincent cringes in some corner. A Commission member remarks that \"Mr. Liberabit<br />\nwas here once before because he 'forgot' to return a reserve<br />\nbook, and was convicted.\"<br />\n\"Why did you not return your reserve book, Victor<br />\nVincent?\". asks a Commission member.<br />\n\"I forgot,\" answers Victor V. \"I possess an incredibly<br />\ninept memory, atrocious reading comprehension, and am<br />\nconstantly seen assiduously attacking one volume on reserve.\"<br />\n\"We don't believe you, Victor Vincent. It is rather<br />\nhard to forget after once being punished, isn't it?\"<br />\n\"I forgot.\"<br />\n\"We don't believe you,\" says an Honor Commission<br />\nman. \"No man could 'forget' twice.\" The bodies in the<br />\nleathered chairs sway in agreement. Victor V. is led from<br />\nthe room. A vote is taken. The Verdict is guilty, the<br />\npenalty, expulsion.<br />\nVictor Vincent Liberabit leaves the room. His red<br />\nleatherette attache case bumps and drags down the stairs.<br />\n\"I forgot,\" says Victor V.<br />\nAnd he did.<br /><br />\nly shown Friday night in the<br />\nBarnstormers' presentation of<br />\nStalag 17 by Bevan and Tyranski.

Even the fact that various<br />\nmembers of the cast frequently<br />\nblew their lines and left uncomfortably silent gaps here and<br />\nthere in the action didn't really<br />\nmar the general effect they<br />\nachieved or cause the audience<br />\nto enjoy the play less.<br />\nVos Laudamus<br />\nSeveral members of the cast<br />\nparticularly deserve mention here<br />\nfor the big part they played in<br />\nthe success of the comedy: Bob<br />\nWibbelsman, Harald<br />\nPappas,<br />\nSteve Zizmare Tony Alfano, Dave<br />\nAdams and Bob Gray.
