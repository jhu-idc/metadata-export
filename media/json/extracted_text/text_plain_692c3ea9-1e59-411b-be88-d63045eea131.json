BEARDSLEY TALKS<br />\nON REAL LITERATURE<br />\nGives Principles of Intelligent<br />\nCriticism of Books<br />\n\"First of all, what is literature ?\"<br />\nsaid Dr. W. A. Beardsley in his<br />\ntalk on \"What is Real Literature\"<br />\nat the assembly Thursday. \"There<br />\nare two answers. First, literature<br />\nis anything which is written\u2014<br />\nsounds simple and is simple. Second, literature is anything which is<br />\nwritten; but with a certain meritorious style.\"<br />\nThis latter definition has reduced<br />\ncriticism of literature to the style of<br />\nthe writing. Style is excessively<br />\nvaried.; each generation has its<br />\nown mode of presentation, its own<br />\nidea about style. Take, for instance, old French literature. which<br />\nis done in epic form and is highly<br />\ncharacteristic of the civilization of<br />\nthe Middle Age. That literature<br />\ncould not be written now, for the<br />\npresent age is too highly complex<br />\nto produce the simplicity of<br />\nthought co-lateral to the Middle<br />\nAges.<br />\nNo more could the type of work<br />\nof the Renaissance be duplicated,<br />\nfor the forces which produced this<br />\nlatter period are unmatched by any<br />\nmodern factors. Later we find the<br />\ndifference between Rabelais of the<br />\nRenaissance and the seventeeth<br />\ncentury literature characterized by<br />\nMontaigne and his essays.<br />\nThen came the court of France<br />\nwhich supported literature. The<br />\nstyle at this period was highly cultured and well developed. Court<br />\nlife and stories of the wealthier<br />\nclass predominated. But all this<br />\nwas overthrown with the court by<br />\nthe French revolution.<br />\nThemes changed, almost overnight, from those of court life to<br />\none expounding against the rich.<br />\nFrom a cultured style the literature<br />\ndropped to that of the rabble and<br />\nmob. The resolution brings us well<br />\nup to modern literature.<br />\nRousseau's doctrines were the<br />\nfoundation upon which \"ego\" in<br />\nliterature bgean ; for Rousseau, like<br />\nVoltaire, advocated any man's doing<br />\nas he liked provided he did not interfere materiallly with others. Voltaire had started this idea, but his<br />\nviews needed liberty to allow them<br />\nto be carried out. On the other<br />\nhand, Rousseau began at the bottom with the axiom that all men<br />\nfree and that they were inherently<br />\ngood but deteriorated with each generation.<br />\n<br />\nBesides the votes for Dr. Goodnow and Norman Thomas, in the<br />\npresidential straw<br />\nvote, Dr.<br />\nBroadus Mitchell was suggested as<br />\na candidate on the Socialist ticket.<br />\nThe final results are:<br />\nRepublicans:<br />\nHoover<br />\n222<br />\nLowden<br />\n14<br />\nWillis<br />\n5<br />\nDawes<br />\n5<br />\nCurtis<br />\n0<br />\n(Continued on Page 5, Column 1)<br />\nDemocrats<br />\nSmith<br />\n197<br />\nRitchie<br />\n90 LAST VESTAGE OF COLLEGIATE YEARS<br />\nReed<br />\n12<br />\nDISAPPEARS WITH NEW GREEK RULING<br />\nWalsh<br />\n\"Yes, we are Collegiate\"\u2014maybe. unwritten laws of the campus by<br />\nDonahey<br />\n1<br />\nThese words once the national an- their efforts to make a pink tea out<br />\nAfter the balloting has been in<br />\nof the glorious class banquet, even<br />\nexistence for four days, 1-13oover them of the carefree youth of the sanctimonious non-paddlers are<br />\n.and Smith had been in the lead America's colleges have now be- horrified.

First, who wrote it.<br />\nThis may sound foolish, but a very<br />\nhigh percentage of those who read<br />\ndo so without the faintest idea of<br />\nwho was the writer. It is easy to<br />\ndetermine an author's name and<br />\none should remember it after he<br />\nfinds it out.<br />\nThe next query is when did he<br />\nwrite it, for a whole different series<br />\nof postulates must be supplied in<br />\norder to judge the book by its age.<br />\nThe third question is why did he<br />\nwrite it. If you are able to learn<br />\nwhy a man wrote a book you have<br />\ntwo-thirds of the knowledge you<br />\nneed in order to judge it.

BEARDSLEY TALKS<br />\nON REAL LITERATURE<br />\nGives Principles of Intelligent<br />\nCriticism of Books<br />\n\"First of all, what is literature ?\"<br />\nsaid Dr. W. A. Beardsley in his<br />\ntalk on \"What is Real Literature\"<br />\nat the assembly Thursday. \"There<br />\nare two answers. First, literature<br />\nis anything which is written\u2014<br />\nsounds simple and is simple. Second, literature is anything which is<br />\nwritten; but with a certain meritorious style.\"<br />\nThis latter definition has reduced<br />\ncriticism of literature to the style of<br />\nthe writing. Style is excessively<br />\nvaried.; each generation has its<br />\nown mode of presentation, its own<br />\nidea about style. Take, for instance, old French literature. which<br />\nis done in epic form and is highly<br />\ncharacteristic of the civilization of<br />\nthe Middle Age. That literature<br />\ncould not be written now, for the<br />\npresent age is too highly complex<br />\nto produce the simplicity of<br />\nthought co-lateral to the Middle<br />\nAges.<br />\nNo more could the type of work<br />\nof the Renaissance be duplicated,<br />\nfor the forces which produced this<br />\nlatter period are unmatched by any<br />\nmodern factors. Later we find the<br />\ndifference between Rabelais of the<br />\nRenaissance and the seventeeth<br />\ncentury literature characterized by<br />\nMontaigne and his essays.<br />\nThen came the court of France<br />\nwhich supported literature. The<br />\nstyle at this period was highly cultured and well developed. Court<br />\nlife and stories of the wealthier<br />\nclass predominated. But all this<br />\nwas overthrown with the court by<br />\nthe French revolution.<br />\nThemes changed, almost overnight, from those of court life to<br />\none expounding against the rich.<br />\nFrom a cultured style the literature<br />\ndropped to that of the rabble and<br />\nmob. The resolution brings us well<br />\nup to modern literature.<br />\nRousseau's doctrines were the<br />\nfoundation upon which \"ego\" in<br />\nliterature bgean ; for Rousseau, like<br />\nVoltaire, advocated any man's doing<br />\nas he liked provided he did not interfere materiallly with others. Voltaire had started this idea, but his<br />\nviews needed liberty to allow them<br />\nto be carried out. On the other<br />\nhand, Rousseau began at the bottom with the axiom that all men<br />\nfree and that they were inherently<br />\ngood but deteriorated with each generation.<br /><br />\nBesides the votes for Dr. Goodnow and Norman Thomas, in the<br />\npresidential straw<br />\nvote, Dr.<br />\nBroadus Mitchell was suggested as<br />\na candidate on the Socialist ticket.<br />\nThe final results are:<br />\nRepublicans:<br />\nHoover<br />\n222<br />\nLowden<br />\n14<br />\nWillis<br />\n5<br />\nDawes<br />\n5<br />\nCurtis<br />\n0<br />\n(Continued on Page 5, Column 1)<br />\nDemocrats<br />\nSmith<br />\n197<br />\nRitchie<br />\n90 LAST VESTAGE OF COLLEGIATE YEARS<br />\nReed<br />\n12<br />\nDISAPPEARS WITH NEW GREEK RULING<br />\nWalsh<br />\n\"Yes, we are Collegiate\"\u2014maybe. unwritten laws of the campus by<br />\nDonahey<br />\n1<br />\nThese words once the national an- their efforts to make a pink tea out<br />\nAfter the balloting has been in<br />\nof the glorious class banquet, even<br />\nexistence for four days, 1-13oover them of the carefree youth of the sanctimonious non-paddlers are<br />\n.and Smith had been in the lead America's colleges have now be- horrified.

About<br />\ntwo-thirds of the English writers<br />\nwere supported thus. The nobility<br />\nliked to have a poet or a shortstory writer about the house. The<br />\nidea behind this support was the<br />\nobvious fact that if a writer had a<br />\npension from the ruler he would<br />\nhardly write against that government in the fear that the reimbursements would be taken away.<br />\nIf one wishes to live and write he<br />\nmust eat, hence economic conditions<br />\nplay a prominent part in literature.<br />\nOther features which control<br />\nliterature are the heredity, of the<br />\nwriter, his mental make-up and the<br />\nenvironment in which he is writing.<br /><br />\nBox 1026 J.

First, who wrote it.<br />\nThis may sound foolish, but a very<br />\nhigh percentage of those who read<br />\ndo so without the faintest idea of<br />\nwho was the writer. It is easy to<br />\ndetermine an author's name and<br />\none should remember it after he<br />\nfinds it out.<br />\nThe next query is when did he<br />\nwrite it, for a whole different series<br />\nof postulates must be supplied in<br />\norder to judge the book by its age.<br />\nThe third question is why did he<br />\nwrite it. If you are able to learn<br />\nwhy a man wrote a book you have<br />\ntwo-thirds of the knowledge you<br />\nneed in order to judge it. Take<br />\n\"Elmer Gantry.\" Lewis may have<br />\nwritten that for several reasons: he<br />\nmay have needed money, he might<br />\nhave written it for the amusement,<br />\nor he could have written it because<br />\nhe detested those who earned their<br />\nliving by teaching or preaching religion.<br />\nThe final question is, could you do<br />\nbetter? This is possible, for when<br />\nyou condemn a book you do so because you have reason to believe<br />\nthat your opinions or judgments are<br />\nbetter than the authors. Your likes<br />\nor dislikes about parts of the book<br />\nare also big factors.<br />\n;<br /><br />\nNumber of Books<br /><br />\n\"But why should I worry whether<br />\nor not you like literature ?\" concluded Dr. Beardsley. \"I don't care<br />\nwhether you ever read another<br />\nbook; but in the process of education you cannot avoid them. There<br />\nare about 8,000 published a year.<br />\nHence, your are bound to read some.<br />\nAnd as long as you are alive and<br />\nread, you should have a basis for<br />\njudgment of books.
