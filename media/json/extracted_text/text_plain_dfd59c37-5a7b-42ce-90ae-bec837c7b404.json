Truly it seems that<br />\nJohns Hopkins methods are not far.aboAw.those of the average<br />\nhigh or preparatory school with regard to *fills matter of socalled discipline. For if, a student, in spite of non-attendance<br />\nupon classes, is able to make a passing grade, should he not be<br />\ngiven credit for the knowledge which he has managed to acquire<br />\nwithout the assistance of the instructor?<br />\nIn nearly every case there should be no reason for this<br />\nrestriction of cuts, for the required attendance upon classes.<br />\nEvery student knows that nine-tenths- of all lectures are merely<br />\na _rehash of matters which are treated fully in the texts. And<br />\nthe Men who do contribute something new to the course in<br />\nTheir lectures have surprisingly few absences to contend with.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has always been an exponent of,free action<br />\nand speech; within the limits of decency, students have been<br />\nallowed to. do almost what they pleased. Other universities<br />\nhave decided to allow unlimited cuts; Harvard and Yale have<br />\nrecently adopted the plan for upperclassmen. We do not advocate freedom from restrictions for the first two classes, but<br />\nwe feel that. upperclassmen should be allowed this additional<br />\nfreedom: It would be in accord with the policy of. advanc6d<br />\nwork and 'freedom of action to which the university stands<br />\ncommitted.<br />\n<br />\nAN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION<br />\nAt the end of his address, made at the recent Sidney Lanier<br />\nmemorial exercises, Dr. Oliver Huckle suggested that the Johns<br />\nHopkins University erect a substantial and material shrine<br />\nto the poet. A room where all Lanier memorabilia could be<br />\ngathered, where relics of the man and the poet could be placed,<br />\nwhere all available manuscripts and editions of the poet's work<br />\ncould be assembled; this was, in the main, Dr. Huckle's idea.<br />\nThis is an excellent suggestion. Lanier was closely connected with Johns Hopkins as a lecturer and teacher. He is<br />\nthe only poet of any rank who has had any close contact with<br />\nthis University. Yet, save for the Lanier ivy that twines about<br />\nthe bricks of Gilman Hall, except for a bust hidden in an<br />\nobscure and dusty corner of a forgotten corridor, there is<br />\nnothing at Homewood, in material form, that brings the poet<br />\nto mind. How pleasant it would be to have a place where one<br />\ncould see the desk at which Lanier wrote, could see the flute<br />\nwhich brought forth \"those golden notes,\" could easily have<br />\naccess to his complete works and manuscripts.<br />\nThe recently formed Lanier Memorial Committee has for<br />\nits object the establishing of a suitable memorial to the poet<br />\nat Hopkins. Such suggestions as that of Dr. Huckle should<br />\nreceive serious consideration.<br />\n<br />\nRevere Osler, who died fighting in<br />\nFrance while yet a student at<br />\nOxford.

As a poet, Dr.<br />\nHuckel declared him to be high<br />\nup in the list of the dozen foremost American poets, and unharmed by comparison with such<br />\nEnglish masters as Shakespeare,<br />\nMilton, Tennyson, and Browning.<br />\n\"Lanier is recognized today as a<br />\ngreat poet and a great soul,\" Dr.<br />\nHuckel said.<br />\nTraces Life<br />\nIn addition to extolling Lanier's<br />\nvarious talents, Dr. Huckel traced<br />\nhis life from the day he was born,<br />\nFebruary 3, 1842, at Macon, Georgia, until his death in Baltimore<br />\non September 7, 1881.

Truly it seems that<br />\nJohns Hopkins methods are not far.aboAw.those of the average<br />\nhigh or preparatory school with regard to *fills matter of socalled discipline. For if, a student, in spite of non-attendance<br />\nupon classes, is able to make a passing grade, should he not be<br />\ngiven credit for the knowledge which he has managed to acquire<br />\nwithout the assistance of the instructor?<br />\nIn nearly every case there should be no reason for this<br />\nrestriction of cuts, for the required attendance upon classes.<br />\nEvery student knows that nine-tenths- of all lectures are merely<br />\na _rehash of matters which are treated fully in the texts.

Other universities<br />\nhave decided to allow unlimited cuts; Harvard and Yale have<br />\nrecently adopted the plan for upperclassmen. We do not advocate freedom from restrictions for the first two classes, but<br />\nwe feel that. upperclassmen should be allowed this additional<br />\nfreedom: It would be in accord with the policy of. advanc6d<br />\nwork and 'freedom of action to which the university stands<br />\ncommitted.<br /><br />\nAN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION<br />\nAt the end of his address, made at the recent Sidney Lanier<br />\nmemorial exercises, Dr. Oliver Huckle suggested that the Johns<br />\nHopkins University erect a substantial and material shrine<br />\nto the poet. A room where all Lanier memorabilia could be<br />\ngathered, where relics of the man and the poet could be placed,<br />\nwhere all available manuscripts and editions of the poet's work<br />\ncould be assembled; this was, in the main, Dr. Huckle's idea.<br />\nThis is an excellent suggestion. Lanier was closely connected with Johns Hopkins as a lecturer and teacher. He is<br />\nthe only poet of any rank who has had any close contact with<br />\nthis University. Yet, save for the Lanier ivy that twines about<br />\nthe bricks of Gilman Hall, except for a bust hidden in an<br />\nobscure and dusty corner of a forgotten corridor, there is<br />\nnothing at Homewood, in material form, that brings the poet<br />\nto mind. How pleasant it would be to have a place where one<br />\ncould see the desk at which Lanier wrote, could see the flute<br />\nwhich brought forth \"those golden notes,\" could easily have<br />\naccess to his complete works and manuscripts.<br />\nThe recently formed Lanier Memorial Committee has for<br />\nits object the establishing of a suitable memorial to the poet<br />\nat Hopkins. Such suggestions as that of Dr. Huckle should<br />\nreceive serious consideration.<br /><br />\nRevere Osler, who died fighting in<br />\nFrance while yet a student at<br />\nOxford.
