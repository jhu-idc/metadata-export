Some twenty or more Phi Gams,<br />\ncompletely independent of any fraternity sanction or formal<br />\nknowledge, visited the ,Goucher College campus last Thursday,<br />\nand while they were there destroyed several sections of copper<br />\ndownspouting on one of the dormitories.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nPeople who dislike the custom of social fraternities argue<br />\nthat the groups encourage just such irresponsible and immature<br />\nactions 0'this. It seems unnecessary to point out that the actions<br />\nof these men will more than outweigh the information the News.Idetter published last week on the Help Week program or the IFB's<br />\nHeart Fund work. Similarly, if the Phi Gams involved were to<br />\npay three times the damage involved, it still would not erase<br />\nthe bad publicity.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the 500 fraternity men on campus<br />\nshould have to suffer from the actions of 20 unthinking students.<br />\nIndirectly, though, all of them, and even the University as a<br />\nwhole, will suffer. The least Phi Gam as a fraternity can do is<br />\nto make good the whole damage, regardless of the final cost, and<br />\nregardless of how much of this amount they can collect from the<br />\nmen involved. If they do not do this, the IFB, for its own Protection, should force them to take action. It is true that this course<br />\nof action would place a burden on the fraternity which is in<br />\nsome respects unfair, but it is still more just than leaving Goucher<br />\nCollege out of poeket for something they did not in any way\\invite.<br />\n<br />\nJoe College Meets Academic Freedom<br />\nThe Hopkins YMCA opens its two-day Academic Freedom<br />\nConference this evening at Levering Hall. On a campus which<br />\nis dedicated largely to intellectual pursuits, it adds to activities<br />\na discussion of academic freedom, among the noblest of intellectual concepts. Not only all Hopkins students, but representatives<br />\nof neighboring campuses have been invited.<br />\nThe moving force behind this innovation is Dr. Chester<br />\nWickwire, the executive secretary at Levering, whose energy<br />\nand perseverance helped to create the conference. Credit is due<br />\nalso to the Y's new president, Ed Freeman, and his cabinet for<br />\ncarrying out the plans, and to \"co-participants\"\u2014The Woodrow<br />\nWilson Club, the Students for Democratic Action, and the<br />\nStudent Committee for Academic Freedom\u2014for sharing the<br />\nwork.<br />\nUntil now the defense of academic freedom upon the Hopkins<br />\ncampus has been the function of these three groups of specialized<br />\nbut limited appeal. For the Wilson Club, the campus Democrats,<br />\ntheir main interest is that the present assailants of academic<br />\nfreedom attack the Democratic Party with the same vitriolic outbursts. For the SDA, academic freedom is merely one bright<br />\nthread in the overall fabric of liberal ideals, while the SCAF<br />\ncontains mostly graduate students, for whom such freedom is<br />\ndirectly a matter of self-preservation. These groups serve their<br />\npurposes, but they cannot arouse the masses of students.<br />\nBut the YMCA is an organization of broad cultural and<br />\nsocial interests, to which a large portion of the undergrads belong.<br />\nAs such it has an obligation to instill in Joe College a little<br />\nresponsibility and interest in the issues relating to his campus<br />\nliberties.<br />\n<br />\nern University is only possible in<br />\nan enlightened atmosphere,\" said<br />\nDr. Leo Spitzer in his speech before the student body last Friday.<br />\nDr. Spitzer traced and compared<br />\n<br />\nthe development of the various ties,\" during a speech given in Leveducational institutions throughering Hall, Thursday, February<br />\nout history.

The Nester (who, by the way,<br />\nis a vice president of the present Board of Intramural Athletics)<br />\nis inclined to agree,with the opinion that the intramural set-up<br />\nisn't nearly as good as it could or should be at Hopkins.<br />\nThe intramural program on this caMpus has prominent<br />\nposition in the mind of Mr. Marshall Turner, so he says, but<br />\nactually it doesn't seem that way from the Nester's viewpoint.<br />\nThe budget allotted to intramurls is by no means adequate to<br />\nhandle the vast number of students presently participating in<br />\nthe program. Also, the present fourteen-man board is not adequately set up and consequently not run correctly from the<br />\nNester's standpoint. Many participants in the intramural program have complained about the work done by the board, but<br />\nactually very few have offered any constructive criticism (and<br />\nthe BIA is open to this at all times.) It should be remembered<br />\nthat the men on the Board of Intramural Athletics get nothing<br />\nin return for their work and responsibility, and under the<br />\npresent system, you can actually expect little more from the<br />\nBoard. The men on it have already done much to give Hopkins<br />\na better intramural program, but their power and scope is<br />\ngreatly limited. A recent instance of this was brought out when<br />\nthe BIA made plans to present the fall sports trophy winners<br />\ntheir awards at the opening home basketball contest, but due<br />\nto an insignificant tradition of the department of athletics (i.e.<br />\nthat of buying all awards from a certain person who happened<br />\nto be sick at the time) they have yet to be awarded. If the awards<br />\ncould have been made at the proper time, the intramural program<br />\nat Hopkins would have gained much publicity and prominence<br />\nen the campus.<br />\n<br />\nAfter spotting Loyola an ea:<br />\n6-point lead, Hopkins drove to<br />\n30-26 halftime edge as reser<br />\nJohn Newton tallied ten se&<br />\nquarter points. Loyola evened I 1<br />\ncount at 30-30, but Hopkins r win<br />\nlied to build up a 53-40, and thlex<br />\na\" 65-55 lead in the last-peehan<br />\nonly to be forced to the limit.sau<br />\n<br />\nthwart a last-minute Hound<br />\nNewton was high scorer for t,_<br />\nOa<br />\nevening, with 20 points.

This is naturally a serious problem, and the Board has<br />\neven seriously considered paying trained students to officiate.<br />\nHowever, to the Nester the only way to help this situation is<br />\nto have a neutral fraternity provide an official or forfeit a certain number of points. Of course, that will mainly help the interfraternity set up, but the independents could also form a neutral<br />\nteam providing referees, but this would probably not work nearly<br />\nas well.<br />\nOther suggestions to improve the present system in intramural athletics and in turn build up interest would be: (1) Have<br />\nthe BIA composed of one member from each fraternity (with<br />\ncompulsory attendance or forfeiture of trophy points), plus a<br />\nPresident, Secretary, and three independent students. (2) Have<br />\neach fraternity taxed a nominal amount ($1.00 would probably<br />\nbe sufficient) for each member of its organization who will take<br />\npart in intramurals for the year. This money would provide for<br />\nthe awards, etc. for the interfraternity league, thus giving all of<br />\nthe present funds for awards to independent sports. (3) Construct an elaborate intramural bulletin board to take the place<br />\nof the present one in order to stir up additional interest among<br />\nall students, and also make it loss work than is presently involved<br />\nin keeping the records up to date.<br />\nAll of the above mentioned suggestions are within reason<br />\nand there should be no drawbacks to any of them. If and when<br />\nthese steps of iMprovement of our intramural program are taken,<br />\nthe student interest will certainly grow tremendously. At present<br />\nthe interest is low, and it is the Nester's belief that only a few<br />\nradical changes can improve the situation. These changes call<br />\nfor some action from the athletic department and especially the<br />\nfraternities.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Swisher Speaks<br />\nDr. Carl Brent Swisher, Professor of Political Science at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University and authority on American constitutional<br />\nhistory and law was the commencement speaker at mid-term<br />\ngraduation exercises at Pomona<br />\nCollege, Claremont, California.<br />\n<br />\ndevelopment of idealistic goals<br />\nunder the condition of liberty<br />\nwhich our laws provide.<br />\n\"In the acceptance of expediency as the appropriate attitude<br />\ntoward life and of comformity to<br />\ncrowd pressure as the basis of<br />\nsecurity and righteousness lies<br />\nour major abuse of liberty,\" he<br />\n<br />\nDr. Swisher is currently on<br />\nDr. Swisher in an address on leave of absence from Johns Hop'Goals of Liberty,\" appealed for kins.<br />\n<br />\nSOn<br />\n<br />\nmost one-sided victories for a Jay (5 and 5); and, Jones (5 and 6).<br />\nsquad in its history.<br />\nCoach Pope's men had six men<br />\nwho went undefeated.

The Nester (who, by the way,<br />\nis a vice president of the present Board of Intramural Athletics)<br />\nis inclined to agree,with the opinion that the intramural set-up<br />\nisn't nearly as good as it could or should be at Hopkins.<br />\nThe intramural program on this caMpus has prominent<br />\nposition in the mind of Mr. Marshall Turner, so he says, but<br />\nactually it doesn't seem that way from the Nester's viewpoint.<br />\nThe budget allotted to intramurls is by no means adequate to<br />\nhandle the vast number of students presently participating in<br />\nthe program. Also, the present fourteen-man board is not adequately set up and consequently not run correctly from the<br />\nNester's standpoint. Many participants in the intramural program have complained about the work done by the board, but<br />\nactually very few have offered any constructive criticism (and<br />\nthe BIA is open to this at all times.) It should be remembered<br />\nthat the men on the Board of Intramural Athletics get nothing<br />\nin return for their work and responsibility, and under the<br />\npresent system, you can actually expect little more from the<br />\nBoard. The men on it have already done much to give Hopkins<br />\na better intramural program, but their power and scope is<br />\ngreatly limited. A recent instance of this was brought out when<br />\nthe BIA made plans to present the fall sports trophy winners<br />\ntheir awards at the opening home basketball contest, but due<br />\nto an insignificant tradition of the department of athletics (i.e.<br />\nthat of buying all awards from a certain person who happened<br />\nto be sick at the time) they have yet to be awarded. If the awards<br />\ncould have been made at the proper time, the intramural program<br />\nat Hopkins would have gained much publicity and prominence<br />\nen the campus.<br /><br />\nAfter spotting Loyola an ea:<br />\n6-point lead, Hopkins drove to<br />\n30-26 halftime edge as reser<br />\nJohn Newton tallied ten se&amp;<br />\nquarter points.

This is naturally a serious problem, and the Board has<br />\neven seriously considered paying trained students to officiate.<br />\nHowever, to the Nester the only way to help this situation is<br />\nto have a neutral fraternity provide an official or forfeit a certain number of points. Of course, that will mainly help the interfraternity set up, but the independents could also form a neutral<br />\nteam providing referees, but this would probably not work nearly<br />\nas well.<br />\nOther suggestions to improve the present system in intramural athletics and in turn build up interest would be: (1) Have<br />\nthe BIA composed of one member from each fraternity (with<br />\ncompulsory attendance or forfeiture of trophy points), plus a<br />\nPresident, Secretary, and three independent students. (2) Have<br />\neach fraternity taxed a nominal amount ($1.00 would probably<br />\nbe sufficient) for each member of its organization who will take<br />\npart in intramurals for the year. This money would provide for<br />\nthe awards, etc. for the interfraternity league, thus giving all of<br />\nthe present funds for awards to independent sports. (3) Construct an elaborate intramural bulletin board to take the place<br />\nof the present one in order to stir up additional interest among<br />\nall students, and also make it loss work than is presently involved<br />\nin keeping the records up to date.<br />\nAll of the above mentioned suggestions are within reason<br />\nand there should be no drawbacks to any of them. If and when<br />\nthese steps of iMprovement of our intramural program are taken,<br />\nthe student interest will certainly grow tremendously. At present<br />\nthe interest is low, and it is the Nester's belief that only a few<br />\nradical changes can improve the situation. These changes call<br />\nfor some action from the athletic department and especially the<br />\nfraternities.<br /><br />\nDr. Swisher Speaks<br />\nDr. Carl Brent Swisher, Professor of Political Science at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University and authority on American constitutional<br />\nhistory and law was the commencement speaker at mid-term<br />\ngraduation exercises at Pomona<br />\nCollege, Claremont, California.<br /><br />\ndevelopment of idealistic goals<br />\nunder the condition of liberty<br />\nwhich our laws provide.<br />\n\"In the acceptance of expediency as the appropriate attitude<br />\ntoward life and of comformity to<br />\ncrowd pressure as the basis of<br />\nsecurity and righteousness lies<br />\nour major abuse of liberty,\" he<br /><br />\nDr. Swisher is currently on<br />\nDr. Swisher in an address on leave of absence from Johns Hop'Goals of Liberty,\" appealed for kins.<br /><br />\nSOn<br /><br />\nmost one-sided victories for a Jay (5 and 5); and, Jones (5 and 6).<br />\nsquad in its history.<br />\nCoach Pope's men had six men<br />\nwho went undefeated.
