This<br />\ncustom, one might almost call it a tradition, has obtained ever since<br />\nthe foundation of the paper ten years or so ago. But customary<br />\nV<br />\nthough it has been, there is no rule which prohibits such discussions<br />\nISVVVVV*<br />\nin this paper and after seriously considering the question, the Board<br />\nEditors of the NEWS-LETTER has come to the conclusion that the<br />\nof<br />\n11<br />\npublication of such Fraternity news as would be of interest to other<br />\nFraternities, would tend to bring about better feeling among the Fraternities here at Hopkins. Almost all the other college papers in this country publish such news; some have a<br />\nregular \"Fraternity\" column. Why should not we ? All of us know that one of the<br />\nFraternities here held a Convention in Philadelphia lately; that a member of the Junior Class<br />\nwas a delegate to the Convention of another Fraternity in Minnesota ten days ago; and that<br />\nthe Alumni Banquet of a third Fraternity had to be called off owing to the death of one of its<br />\nofficers. Why ,should not such news be published in this .paper ? It would be of interest to<br />\nthe student-body; it would interest our subscribers among the Alumni.<br />\nAnother side of the question is the much-mooted proposition of an inter-fraternity organization, in the nature of a Pan-Hellenic. The NEws-LETTER believes that such an organization, if begun and carried on in the right way, would be of great benefit to the University.<br />\nBut we can, of course, do nothing to start such a movement. The initiative must come from<br />\nthe Fraternities themselves. But if such an initiative does come, our columns are at the disposal of all those Who care to discuss their views or suggest plans. Two things, however,<br />\nmust be emphasized. A Pan-Hellenic must be an entirely non-secret society, and it must be<br />\nrepresentative of all of our fraternities.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nHERE has been some talk of changing the date of the last Hopkins<br />\nDance. The date, as originally scheduled, is April 24th. This time<br />\n1<br />\n_<br />\n)0 011:16 V 41 WV,V<br />\nwith the arrangements of the lacrOsse team, and now that<br />\ninterferes<br />\n41-1<br />\nthe Junior Cotillon is to be held on that date, our dance must<br />\nmanifestly be set for another time. So April 9 was set as the most<br />\nconvenient date for the dance. But this is in Lent, and while for a<br />\ngreat many members of the University this fact will make no difference, it will prevent the attendance of a few at least, and, what is<br />\nmore important, of a good many girls.<br />\nCannot a date be found which would be suitable for everybody?<br />\nwill be rather late, but why not Monday or Tuesday of Easter<br />\n24<br />\nAny time later than April<br />\nweek, April 20 or 21? Some one has said that Dean Griffen would probably not allow the<br />\ndance to be held on either of these days. We cannot imagine why he should make any<br />\nobjection. (See Page 8.)<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 `1-111,1,1TV<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nHE good showing of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs at the Roland<br />\nPark Concert is gratifying, and the two leaders, Messrs. Ruth and<br />\nHughes, and the manager, Mr. Pedrick, deserve great credit. The<br />\ncondition of the Clubs looked rather \"sad\" at the commencement of<br />\nthe winter, but steady hard work and determination have at last<br />\nreally \"rounded them into\" that \"shape\" which has so often been<br />\nforetold in this paper, in various articles on the Musical Clubs. On<br />\nthe night of March 13, the date on which this number of the NEWSLETTER appears, there is going to be, as we trust all of you know, a<br />\njoint concert by the Musical Clubs of the Woman's College and<br />\nHopkins.

Y., Feb. 24, '08<br />\nDEAR SIR:<br />\nIs there a young man in your University,<br />\nwho would like to make a little \"extra\"<br />\nmoney?<br />\nI am the patentee of an inexpensive, though<br />\nstriking, Decorative Idea, specially adapted<br />\nfor walls of college rooms, dens, libraries, etc.,<br />\nand will give a liberal discount, from 30 to 40<br />\nper cent., according to number of orders<br />\nreceived.<br />\nWill be pleased to send the Decoration in<br />\nyour University colors, if you will send<br />\nsamples of the shades and 50c. in stamps.<br />\nYour name was given me by one of the<br />\nstaff of \"The Stute,\" Stevens Institute,<br />\nHoboken, N. J.<br />\nTrusting to hear favorably from you, I am,<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\n(Miss) EVA SWITZER.<br />\n<br />\nELEVENTH ANNUAL INTERCLASS DEBATE AND PUBLIC SPEAKING.<br />\nAs usual, the Interclass Debate and Public<br />\nSpeaking Contest proved to be a very interesting affair. This event has become quite<br />\npopular, and is looked forward to by a great<br />\nmany, as was shown by the crowded condition<br />\nof McCoy Hall. The program was of the<br />\ncustomary style, being opened with a selection<br />\nby the Mandolin Club as the speakers and<br />\njudges entered. Dr. French, who presided<br />\nover the occasion, then introduced the orators.<br />\nMr. Louis Leopold Mann delivered most<br />\nexcellently a speech on \"True Americanism.\"<br />\nThe judges awarded the prize to Mr. Mann,<br />\nalthough they were not unanimous in their<br />\ndecision. They thought that it was a close<br />\nrace between Mr. Mann and Mr. Deale, who<br />\nmade \"A Plea for Cuba.\" Mr. Deale's<br />\ndelivery was very good and his voice filled<br />\nthe hall. After the decision of the judges<br />\nwas announced by L. Edwin Goldman, Esq.,<br />\nthe Glee Club sang \"Rah for Black and Blue.\"<br />\nDuring this song the students in the back of<br />\nthe hall joined in the chorus, which tended to<br />\nmake things more lively and not so solemn as<br />\n<br />\nthey usually are on this occasion. The<br />\naudience was so appreciative and applauded<br />\nso long that, even though the Glee Club had<br />\ngone around to the rear of the hall, they sang<br />\n\"Our Alma Mater in Dixie Land.\"<br />\nThen catne the debate\u2014the really serious<br />\npart of the, program. The question which<br />\nwas debated was, \"Resolved, that National<br />\nbanks should be permitted to issue, subject to<br />\ntax and government supervision, notes based<br />\non their general assets.\" The Class of 1909<br />\nhad the affirmative, and the Class of 1908 the<br />\nnegative. Messrs. Marvel, Blum and Fisher<br />\nspoke on the affirmative, and the Class of<br />\n1908 was represented by Mr. Mann, Mr. McCauley and Mr. Hutzler. The alternates for<br />\nthe Juniors and Seniors were Messrs.<br />\nGuerard, and Sykes, respectively, and the<br />\nadvisers were Mr. Corner and Mr. Wright.<br />\nThe debate was very close, but the judges,<br />\nwho were Dr. Fabian Franklin, George R.<br />\nWillis, Esq., and George L. P. Radcliffe,<br />\nEsq., decided in favor of the negative. In<br />\nthe meantime, while the judges were out, the<br />\nMandolin Club played \"Lady Laughter.\"<br />\nThe hall was very tastefully decorated with<br />\nall the Hopkins banners and class flags, and<br />\nthe stage with palms and carnations. All this<br />\nadded to the attractiveness of the occasion,<br />\nwhich was indeed most enjoyable.<br />\n<br />\nCOMPLAINT TO HIS EMPTY PURSE.<br />\nNickles, nickles, nickels,<br />\nHark, I hear them fall;<br />\nMine go in the gutter,<br />\nYours,against the wall.<br />\nNickles, nickles, nickles,<br />\nI see them in my dreams,<br />\nI hear the winner's joyful laugh,<br />\nI hear the loser's screams.<br />\nNickles, nickles, nickles,<br />\n0, hearken as I sing\u2014<br />\nThe nickles that I won last fall<br />\nI've already lost this spring.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nJOINT CONCERT.<br />\nOf course, every one has heard about the<br />\nJoint Concert by the Musical Clubs of the<br />\nWoman's College of Baltimore and the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, to be given Friday,<br />\nMarch 13, in McCoy Hall. Most of the<br />\nstudents, at any rate, have heard the rehearsals of the combined Glee Clubs and combined<br />\nMandolin Clubs. The Clubs have been working very hard to make this concert a complete<br />\nsuccess. It has been two years since the<br />\nHopkins Musical Clubs have given a Baltimore<br />\nconcert, and, therefore, the Management hopes<br />\nto fill McCoy Hall to overflowing. Although<br />\nthe Woman's College and Hopkins gave a<br />\njoint concert several years ago, there were no<br />\ncombined numbers on the program as there<br />\nwill be this time. A double sextet, composed<br />\nof six from each Mandolin Club, will play the<br />\n\"Sextet from Lucia.\" There will be three or<br />\nfour solos, both vocal and instrumental, and a<br />\nvocal duet by Miss Bishop and Mr. Uhlig.<br />\nThe program will close with a concerted piece<br />\nby the Glee Clubs. This will be the greatest<br />\nthing that the Clubs have ever tried, as there<br />\nwill be about fifty voices in the chorus.<br />\nThere is a long list of patronesses of the<br />\nmost prominent people in Baltimore. Up to<br />\nthe present time the Management have been<br />\nvery successful in that most of the patronesses<br />\ntook the tickets that were sent to them and<br />\nhave made the returns for them. However,<br />\nsome of those who have accepted evidently<br />\nthought that the tickets, which were enclosed,<br />\nwere complimentary, which, we are sorry to<br />\nsay, was not the case.<br />\nThe reserved seats, which are on sale at<br />\nAlbaugh's, 109 N. Charles street, are at<br />\npresent selling very well, and the Management is very much encouraged and expects to<br />\nclear several hundred dollars. It must be<br />\nremembered that all the seats in the hall will<br />\nbe reserved at $1.00, 75c. and 50c. The<br />\nwhite tickets, which were sent to the patronesses and which are being sold by the students,<br />\nmust be exchanged at Albaugh's for reserved<br />\nseats, and will not be accepted at the door.<br />\nNo tickets will be sold at McCoy Hall on<br />\nthe night of the concert, but if any one comes<br />\nwith the white tickets and if there are any<br />\nreserved seats left, the white tickets will be<br />\nexchanged for reserved seats. But we hope<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nthat there will be no reserved seats left. The<br />\nManagement hopes to make enough money to<br />\npay off the old debts of two years ago, and<br />\nalso to enable the Hopkins Musical Clubs to<br />\ntake a trip to Washington to give a concert at<br />\ntheir own risk and to take an Easter trip down<br />\nthe Eastern Shore.<br />\nIn fact arrangements are being made to<br />\ngive a concert in Washington either at<br />\nRauscher's or the New Williard ball-room<br />\nabout the last of March or the first part of<br />\nApril. The Manager feels confident that if<br />\nthe Clubs should give the proposed concert in<br />\nWashington, it would be a financial success.<br />\nHe is quite anxious for the Hopkins Musical<br />\nClubs to establish a good reputation in that<br />\ncity and also the custom of giving an annual<br />\nconcert there.<br />\nThe Management wishes to urge, through<br />\nthe columns of the NEWS-LETTER, that every<br />\nstudent who has not already bought at least<br />\none ticket should do so as soon as he receives<br />\nthis copy of the paper and come to the concert to-night.<br />\n<br />\nTHE BARBER UNCIVIL.<br />\nHAIR RAZOR.)<br />\nOPERETTA IN ONE ACT.<br />\n(A<br />\n<br />\nCAST: WALTER NOIR-A BARBER.<br />\nWALTER BLANC-A STUDENT.<br />\n<br />\nSCENE-THE BASEMENT.<br />\nWALTER NOIR (cant.)\u2014<br />\nHo, I am a barber brave,<br />\nI clip, shampoo and shave<br />\nAnd I make hair tonic, too,<br />\nBehold what it can do.<br />\n<br />\nWALTER BLANC (cant.)\u2014<br />\nI feared that I'd be bald,<br />\nThis barber's help I called;<br />\nBehold my golden hair,<br />\nThe result of the tonic there.<br />\n<br />\nCHORUS-0, we are a gallant crew,<br />\nWe know just what to do.<br />\nW.

Last year the team lost but one<br />\ngame. The team this year will have to work<br />\nto beat this record.\u2014The<br />\nA meeting of candidates for the University<br />\nand Freshman lacrosse teams was held last<br />\nnight in the Trophy Room of the Union.<br />\nL. D. Cox '08, manager of the University<br />\nteam, outlined the season's plans. Practice<br />\nwill begin as soon as the handball courts are<br />\nclear of snow and will continue daily at 4<br />\no'clock in two squads: the first containing<br />\nexperienced players and the second the new<br />\ncandidates, both for the Freshmen and University teams. The class games will be held<br />\nas soon as Soldiers Field is available for play.<br />\nThe second team will be more carefully organized than in previous years and will play<br />\nseveral outside games. In the Easter vacation the University team will go on a southern<br />\ntrip on which they will play five games. After<br />\nthe series of league games, a game may be<br />\nplayed with the University of Toronto, the<br />\nCanadian champion for three years. The<br />\nteam is to be coached by a former member of<br />\nthe Montreal team.\u2014Crimson, March 3.<br />\nPreliminary practice for the University and<br />\nFreshman lacrosse teams started yesterday<br />\n<br />\nafternoon in the handball courts, back of the<br />\nHemenway Gymnasium. This week will be<br />\ndevoted to the coaching of new men; experienced men will not be called out until Monday. Practice will be held back of the Gymnasium until Soldiers Field is in a good condition. The class games, in which cups and<br />\nclass numerals will be rewarded to the winning team, will take place early in April.<br />\nThe University team will go south during<br />\nthe Easter recess and play five games, including a probable game with Annapolis.<br />\nAbout the middle of May there will be a trip<br />\nto New York, on which two games will be<br />\nplayed. The season will end early in June,<br />\nwhen it is expected that a game will be arranged with the University of Toronto.\u2014<br />\nCrimson, March 5.<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nWith the first game less than a month off,<br />\nthe lacrosse team is hard at work trying to<br />\nround into shape for its long season. The<br />\nsquad will probably have gotten out to Homewood by the time this is published, and will<br />\nhave had an opportunity to see what the new<br />\nfield is like for lacrosse. As yet the team has<br />\nby no means shown the form which is expected of it. This may be due, in part, to<br />\nthe cramped quarters of the cage, but the<br />\ntruth of the matter is, that the fellows have<br />\nnot, on the whole, taken hold of the matter as<br />\nthey should. Several of the older men have<br />\n<br />\n\f7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nbegun to rest on their laurels, which by the<br />\nway are none too brilliant, and evidently<br />\nthink they need practice only on one or two<br />\ndays a week. This is not the right spirit.<br />\nThe fact that there are a number of experienced players back this year is no reason<br />\nwhy the men should become too optimistic<br />\nand get swelled heads. The schedule this<br />\nyear is the best we have ever had and the<br />\nhardest. To win those last three games\u2014<br />\nSwarthmore, Mt. Washington and Toronto\u2014<br />\nwill call for the best team the \"Black and<br />\nBlue\" ever turned out, a team that shall be a<br />\nunit, and not a collection of individual stars.<br />\nEach man owes it to the University and to<br />\nhis mates on the team to do everything in his<br />\npower to put out the strongest team possible.<br />\nIt is not fair for one or two men to endanger<br />\nthe championship, which the others will so<br />\nearnestly strive for.<br />\nThe team is far from picked. Who will<br />\nplay second defense and who are going to get<br />\nthe home positions? These three places are<br />\nbeing eagerly fought for, and from the present<br />\noutlook it will take more than one game to<br />\nsift out the men and see who deserves the<br />\nplace. Ralph Williams, Herbert Price, Oliver<br />\nHopkins and H. L. Russell are all making<br />\nstrong bids for the defense position, while for<br />\nthe homes there are candidates galore, the<br />\nmost promising of which are Mathias, Ciary,<br />\nLowndes, Whitcraft, Stockett, Smith, Wilson<br />\nand Tappan. As yet, none have been proved<br />\nto be world-beaters.<br />\nThe trouble from time immemorial has been<br />\nto get the attack to work in properly, and this<br />\nyear bids fair to be a repetition of former<br />\nyears in that respect. It is to be hoped that<br />\nthings will be working properly by the time<br />\nthe first game comes off.<br />\nWas there ever a better schedule than the<br />\none arranged for the team this year? Those<br />\nlast three games in Baltimore will be great,<br />\nand if the students don't get behind the team<br />\nthen, they will never have a better chance.<br />\nThis year's schedule is worth a whole winter's<br />\ntraining for; there are enough games to look<br />\nforward to, and with all these fine games on<br />\nour own field Baltimore may expect to see<br />\nsome mighty good lacrosse. The manager<br />\nhas done his best to get a schedule; the players<br />\nwill do their best to bring back another<br />\n<br />\nchampionship banner, and it is up to the<br />\nstudents to do their best in the way of rooting. Let us have some support such as was<br />\ngiven the football team last fall, and there<br />\nwill not be much question as to the outcome<br />\nof the season, either from a financial or playing point of view.<br />\n<br />\nTHE CROSS COUNTRY RUN.<br />\nFrom the way the entries are coming in,<br />\nour cross country run, which will be held at<br />\nHomewood, Saturday, March 14, will afford<br />\nsome excellent sport. Lou Conners, of<br />\nWesleyan; Fleming, of George Washington<br />\nUniversity; Whit e, of the Bloomingdale<br />\nAthletic Club, have entered. Both the<br />\nWestern High School, of Washington, and<br />\nthe Cross Country Club, of this city, have also<br />\nentered teams of five men. Additional entries<br />\nare expected from Pennsylvania, Virginia and<br />\nother local organizations.<br />\nThe run will be conducted on the open<br />\nhandicap basis. A fine gold pendant medal<br />\nhas been donated by A. G. Spaulding & Bros.<br />\nfor first prize, while silver and bronze medals<br />\nwill go to the second and third men. A banner will also be given to the team of four men<br />\nthat do the best work in scoring points.<br />\nThe run will start from Homewood at 2<br />\no'clock, and will go out Charles street avenue<br />\nto Belvedere, over Belvedere to Roland avenue;<br />\nthen to the car barn on the Falls Road and<br />\ndown the Falls Road to Cold Spring Lane,<br />\nthence to Roland avenue, Merryman's Lane,<br />\nback to Homewood.<br />\nThe Hopkins team will be picked from :<br />\nBrenton, Breyer, Griffith, Russell, Armstrong,<br />\nBurgan, Wolfe, Tappan and Reeside.<br />\n<br />\nTHE MEET.<br />\nOur meet was a great success this year.<br />\nBoth the open events and relay races brought<br />\nout some of the closest competition of the<br />\nyear. The speed with which the track events<br />\nwere run off sets a new mark for this city, for<br />\nshortly before 10 o'clock the last race was<br />\nover. Great credit is due Mr. Wylie, the<br />\nmanager of the track team, for the way in<br />\nwhich he overcame the very limited accom-<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nmodations of the cage, and caused the meet<br />\nto be such a financial and athletic success.<br />\nThe best feature, however, was that our<br />\nown track men won the meet with 17% points.<br />\nMount Washington landed second, with 15<br />\npoints. It was by the closest kind of a shave<br />\nthat we won our last 2Y4. points. Four men<br />\nwere tie in the pole vault with a jump of 10<br />\nfeet. Not one of these men could get over<br />\nthe bar at 10 feet, 6 inches, and according to<br />\nthe inter-collegiate rules the bar could<br />\nnot be lowered. So there the matter stood.<br />\nThe judges finally decided to split the points<br />\nand let the men draw for the medals. It is<br />\nsingular to remark that Bridgman, who scored<br />\nthe winning points for the Varsity, drew a<br />\nblank and received no medal.<br />\nOur men did excellent work in the distance.<br />\nIn the mile run Griffith and Breyer won first<br />\nand second places, while in the - half mile<br />\nBreyer and Wallis came in second and third.<br />\nThe mile race was a great one, and the time<br />\nis believed to have been the fastest ever made<br />\nin the cage. Griffith won by making a final<br />\nspurt that broke the tape only a few inches<br />\nahead of Breyer. .G. A. Stewart did good<br />\nwork in the 440, winning second place. Although both Baily and Stollenwerck qualified<br />\nin their heat in the 30-yard dash, neither<br />\nscored in the finals.<br />\nProbably the most interesting event of the<br />\nevening was the mile relay between the<br />\nJuniors and Freshmen. The race was exceedingly close, for never were the runners<br />\nmore than 5 or 6 yards apart. The first three<br />\nJuniors, Schneeberger, Wylie and Wallis, won<br />\na lead of about 5 yards on their opponents,<br />\nWolfe, Tappan and Burgan. Stollenwerck,<br />\nhowever, the last man for the Freshmen,<br />\ngradually overtook Baily, the Junior captain,<br />\nand passed him on the last quarter of a lap.<br />\n<br />\nthey succeeded in winning both the 1,000yard and mile runs. Brenton won the shorter<br />\nevent handily and finished second in the mile<br />\nrun, in which Breyer came first.<br />\n<br />\nTHE DANCE.<br />\nSince the Editorial on page 3 was put into<br />\ntype, May the ninth has been definitely fixed<br />\nfor the last dance of the Hopkins Cotillon<br />\nClub.<br />\n<br />\nALUMNI NOTES.<br />\nFrank Thorpe, '05, is a lieutenant in the<br />\nU.

This little<br />\npaper, (which is partly in Spanish and partly<br />\nin English), is exceedingly well done, and<br />\nwould cause considerable surprise to those<br />\nwho vaguely think of Porto Rico as a land of<br />\npalm-trees and fiestas and bull-fights.

This<br />\ncustom, one might almost call it a tradition, has obtained ever since<br />\nthe foundation of the paper ten years or so ago. But customary<br />\nV<br />\nthough it has been, there is no rule which prohibits such discussions<br />\nISVVVVV*<br />\nin this paper and after seriously considering the question, the Board<br />\nEditors of the NEWS-LETTER has come to the conclusion that the<br />\nof<br />\n11<br />\npublication of such Fraternity news as would be of interest to other<br />\nFraternities, would tend to bring about better feeling among the Fraternities here at Hopkins. Almost all the other college papers in this country publish such news; some have a<br />\nregular \"Fraternity\" column. Why should not we ? All of us know that one of the<br />\nFraternities here held a Convention in Philadelphia lately; that a member of the Junior Class<br />\nwas a delegate to the Convention of another Fraternity in Minnesota ten days ago; and that<br />\nthe Alumni Banquet of a third Fraternity had to be called off owing to the death of one of its<br />\nofficers. Why ,should not such news be published in this .paper ? It would be of interest to<br />\nthe student-body; it would interest our subscribers among the Alumni.<br />\nAnother side of the question is the much-mooted proposition of an inter-fraternity organization, in the nature of a Pan-Hellenic. The NEws-LETTER believes that such an organization, if begun and carried on in the right way, would be of great benefit to the University.<br />\nBut we can, of course, do nothing to start such a movement. The initiative must come from<br />\nthe Fraternities themselves. But if such an initiative does come, our columns are at the disposal of all those Who care to discuss their views or suggest plans. Two things, however,<br />\nmust be emphasized. A Pan-Hellenic must be an entirely non-secret society, and it must be<br />\nrepresentative of all of our fraternities.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nHERE has been some talk of changing the date of the last Hopkins<br />\nDance. The date, as originally scheduled, is April 24th. This time<br />\n1<br />\n_<br />\n)0 011:16 V 41 WV,V<br />\nwith the arrangements of the lacrOsse team, and now that<br />\ninterferes<br />\n41-1<br />\nthe Junior Cotillon is to be held on that date, our dance must<br />\nmanifestly be set for another time. So April 9 was set as the most<br />\nconvenient date for the dance. But this is in Lent, and while for a<br />\ngreat many members of the University this fact will make no difference, it will prevent the attendance of a few at least, and, what is<br />\nmore important, of a good many girls.<br />\nCannot a date be found which would be suitable for everybody?<br />\nwill be rather late, but why not Monday or Tuesday of Easter<br />\n24<br />\nAny time later than April<br />\nweek, April 20 or 21? Some one has said that Dean Griffen would probably not allow the<br />\ndance to be held on either of these days. We cannot imagine why he should make any<br />\nobjection. (See Page 8.)<br /><br />\n\u2022 `1-111,1,1TV<br />\nV<br /><br />\nHE good showing of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs at the Roland<br />\nPark Concert is gratifying, and the two leaders, Messrs. Ruth and<br />\nHughes, and the manager, Mr. Pedrick, deserve great credit. The<br />\ncondition of the Clubs looked rather \"sad\" at the commencement of<br />\nthe winter, but steady hard work and determination have at last<br />\nreally \"rounded them into\" that \"shape\" which has so often been<br />\nforetold in this paper, in various articles on the Musical Clubs. On<br />\nthe night of March 13, the date on which this number of the NEWSLETTER appears, there is going to be, as we trust all of you know, a<br />\njoint concert by the Musical Clubs of the Woman's College and<br />\nHopkins.

Y., Feb. 24, '08<br />\nDEAR SIR:<br />\nIs there a young man in your University,<br />\nwho would like to make a little \"extra\"<br />\nmoney?<br />\nI am the patentee of an inexpensive, though<br />\nstriking, Decorative Idea, specially adapted<br />\nfor walls of college rooms, dens, libraries, etc.,<br />\nand will give a liberal discount, from 30 to 40<br />\nper cent., according to number of orders<br />\nreceived.<br />\nWill be pleased to send the Decoration in<br />\nyour University colors, if you will send<br />\nsamples of the shades and 50c. in stamps.<br />\nYour name was given me by one of the<br />\nstaff of \"The Stute,\" Stevens Institute,<br />\nHoboken, N. J.<br />\nTrusting to hear favorably from you, I am,<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\n(Miss) EVA SWITZER.<br /><br />\nELEVENTH ANNUAL INTERCLASS DEBATE AND PUBLIC SPEAKING.<br />\nAs usual, the Interclass Debate and Public<br />\nSpeaking Contest proved to be a very interesting affair. This event has become quite<br />\npopular, and is looked forward to by a great<br />\nmany, as was shown by the crowded condition<br />\nof McCoy Hall. The program was of the<br />\ncustomary style, being opened with a selection<br />\nby the Mandolin Club as the speakers and<br />\njudges entered. Dr. French, who presided<br />\nover the occasion, then introduced the orators.<br />\nMr. Louis Leopold Mann delivered most<br />\nexcellently a speech on \"True Americanism.\"<br />\nThe judges awarded the prize to Mr. Mann,<br />\nalthough they were not unanimous in their<br />\ndecision. They thought that it was a close<br />\nrace between Mr. Mann and Mr. Deale, who<br />\nmade \"A Plea for Cuba.\" Mr. Deale's<br />\ndelivery was very good and his voice filled<br />\nthe hall. After the decision of the judges<br />\nwas announced by L. Edwin Goldman, Esq.,<br />\nthe Glee Club sang \"Rah for Black and Blue.\"<br />\nDuring this song the students in the back of<br />\nthe hall joined in the chorus, which tended to<br />\nmake things more lively and not so solemn as<br /><br />\nthey usually are on this occasion. The<br />\naudience was so appreciative and applauded<br />\nso long that, even though the Glee Club had<br />\ngone around to the rear of the hall, they sang<br />\n\"Our Alma Mater in Dixie Land.\"<br />\nThen catne the debate\u2014the really serious<br />\npart of the, program. The question which<br />\nwas debated was, \"Resolved, that National<br />\nbanks should be permitted to issue, subject to<br />\ntax and government supervision, notes based<br />\non their general assets.\" The Class of 1909<br />\nhad the affirmative, and the Class of 1908 the<br />\nnegative. Messrs. Marvel, Blum and Fisher<br />\nspoke on the affirmative, and the Class of<br />\n1908 was represented by Mr. Mann, Mr. McCauley and Mr. Hutzler. The alternates for<br />\nthe Juniors and Seniors were Messrs.<br />\nGuerard, and Sykes, respectively, and the<br />\nadvisers were Mr. Corner and Mr. Wright.<br />\nThe debate was very close, but the judges,<br />\nwho were Dr. Fabian Franklin, George R.<br />\nWillis, Esq., and George L. P. Radcliffe,<br />\nEsq., decided in favor of the negative. In<br />\nthe meantime, while the judges were out, the<br />\nMandolin Club played \"Lady Laughter.\"<br />\nThe hall was very tastefully decorated with<br />\nall the Hopkins banners and class flags, and<br />\nthe stage with palms and carnations. All this<br />\nadded to the attractiveness of the occasion,<br />\nwhich was indeed most enjoyable.<br /><br />\nCOMPLAINT TO HIS EMPTY PURSE.<br />\nNickles, nickles, nickels,<br />\nHark, I hear them fall;<br />\nMine go in the gutter,<br />\nYours,against the wall.<br />\nNickles, nickles, nickles,<br />\nI see them in my dreams,<br />\nI hear the winner's joyful laugh,<br />\nI hear the loser's screams.<br />\nNickles, nickles, nickles,<br />\n0, hearken as I sing\u2014<br />\nThe nickles that I won last fall<br />\nI've already lost this spring.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nJOINT CONCERT.<br />\nOf course, every one has heard about the<br />\nJoint Concert by the Musical Clubs of the<br />\nWoman's College of Baltimore and the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, to be given Friday,<br />\nMarch 13, in McCoy Hall. Most of the<br />\nstudents, at any rate, have heard the rehearsals of the combined Glee Clubs and combined<br />\nMandolin Clubs. The Clubs have been working very hard to make this concert a complete<br />\nsuccess. It has been two years since the<br />\nHopkins Musical Clubs have given a Baltimore<br />\nconcert, and, therefore, the Management hopes<br />\nto fill McCoy Hall to overflowing. Although<br />\nthe Woman's College and Hopkins gave a<br />\njoint concert several years ago, there were no<br />\ncombined numbers on the program as there<br />\nwill be this time. A double sextet, composed<br />\nof six from each Mandolin Club, will play the<br />\n\"Sextet from Lucia.\" There will be three or<br />\nfour solos, both vocal and instrumental, and a<br />\nvocal duet by Miss Bishop and Mr. Uhlig.<br />\nThe program will close with a concerted piece<br />\nby the Glee Clubs. This will be the greatest<br />\nthing that the Clubs have ever tried, as there<br />\nwill be about fifty voices in the chorus.<br />\nThere is a long list of patronesses of the<br />\nmost prominent people in Baltimore. Up to<br />\nthe present time the Management have been<br />\nvery successful in that most of the patronesses<br />\ntook the tickets that were sent to them and<br />\nhave made the returns for them. However,<br />\nsome of those who have accepted evidently<br />\nthought that the tickets, which were enclosed,<br />\nwere complimentary, which, we are sorry to<br />\nsay, was not the case.<br />\nThe reserved seats, which are on sale at<br />\nAlbaugh's, 109 N. Charles street, are at<br />\npresent selling very well, and the Management is very much encouraged and expects to<br />\nclear several hundred dollars. It must be<br />\nremembered that all the seats in the hall will<br />\nbe reserved at $1.00, 75c. and 50c. The<br />\nwhite tickets, which were sent to the patronesses and which are being sold by the students,<br />\nmust be exchanged at Albaugh's for reserved<br />\nseats, and will not be accepted at the door.<br />\nNo tickets will be sold at McCoy Hall on<br />\nthe night of the concert, but if any one comes<br />\nwith the white tickets and if there are any<br />\nreserved seats left, the white tickets will be<br />\nexchanged for reserved seats. But we hope<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nthat there will be no reserved seats left. The<br />\nManagement hopes to make enough money to<br />\npay off the old debts of two years ago, and<br />\nalso to enable the Hopkins Musical Clubs to<br />\ntake a trip to Washington to give a concert at<br />\ntheir own risk and to take an Easter trip down<br />\nthe Eastern Shore.<br />\nIn fact arrangements are being made to<br />\ngive a concert in Washington either at<br />\nRauscher's or the New Williard ball-room<br />\nabout the last of March or the first part of<br />\nApril. The Manager feels confident that if<br />\nthe Clubs should give the proposed concert in<br />\nWashington, it would be a financial success.<br />\nHe is quite anxious for the Hopkins Musical<br />\nClubs to establish a good reputation in that<br />\ncity and also the custom of giving an annual<br />\nconcert there.<br />\nThe Management wishes to urge, through<br />\nthe columns of the NEWS-LETTER, that every<br />\nstudent who has not already bought at least<br />\none ticket should do so as soon as he receives<br />\nthis copy of the paper and come to the concert to-night.<br /><br />\nTHE BARBER UNCIVIL.<br />\nHAIR RAZOR.)<br />\nOPERETTA IN ONE ACT.<br />\n(A<br /><br />\nCAST: WALTER NOIR-A BARBER.<br />\nWALTER BLANC-A STUDENT.<br /><br />\nSCENE-THE BASEMENT.<br />\nWALTER NOIR (cant.)\u2014<br />\nHo, I am a barber brave,<br />\nI clip, shampoo and shave<br />\nAnd I make hair tonic, too,<br />\nBehold what it can do.<br /><br />\nWALTER BLANC (cant.)\u2014<br />\nI feared that I'd be bald,<br />\nThis barber's help I called;<br />\nBehold my golden hair,<br />\nThe result of the tonic there.<br /><br />\nCHORUS-0, we are a gallant crew,<br />\nWe know just what to do.<br />\nW.

D. Cox '08, manager of the University<br />\nteam, outlined the season's plans. Practice<br />\nwill begin as soon as the handball courts are<br />\nclear of snow and will continue daily at 4<br />\no'clock in two squads: the first containing<br />\nexperienced players and the second the new<br />\ncandidates, both for the Freshmen and University teams. The class games will be held<br />\nas soon as Soldiers Field is available for play.<br />\nThe second team will be more carefully organized than in previous years and will play<br />\nseveral outside games. In the Easter vacation the University team will go on a southern<br />\ntrip on which they will play five games. After<br />\nthe series of league games, a game may be<br />\nplayed with the University of Toronto, the<br />\nCanadian champion for three years. The<br />\nteam is to be coached by a former member of<br />\nthe Montreal team.\u2014Crimson, March 3.<br />\nPreliminary practice for the University and<br />\nFreshman lacrosse teams started yesterday<br /><br />\nafternoon in the handball courts, back of the<br />\nHemenway Gymnasium. This week will be<br />\ndevoted to the coaching of new men; experienced men will not be called out until Monday. Practice will be held back of the Gymnasium until Soldiers Field is in a good condition. The class games, in which cups and<br />\nclass numerals will be rewarded to the winning team, will take place early in April.<br />\nThe University team will go south during<br />\nthe Easter recess and play five games, including a probable game with Annapolis.<br />\nAbout the middle of May there will be a trip<br />\nto New York, on which two games will be<br />\nplayed. The season will end early in June,<br />\nwhen it is expected that a game will be arranged with the University of Toronto.\u2014<br />\nCrimson, March 5.<br /><br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nWith the first game less than a month off,<br />\nthe lacrosse team is hard at work trying to<br />\nround into shape for its long season. The<br />\nsquad will probably have gotten out to Homewood by the time this is published, and will<br />\nhave had an opportunity to see what the new<br />\nfield is like for lacrosse. As yet the team has<br />\nby no means shown the form which is expected of it. This may be due, in part, to<br />\nthe cramped quarters of the cage, but the<br />\ntruth of the matter is, that the fellows have<br />\nnot, on the whole, taken hold of the matter as<br />\nthey should. Several of the older men have<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nbegun to rest on their laurels, which by the<br />\nway are none too brilliant, and evidently<br />\nthink they need practice only on one or two<br />\ndays a week. This is not the right spirit.<br />\nThe fact that there are a number of experienced players back this year is no reason<br />\nwhy the men should become too optimistic<br />\nand get swelled heads. The schedule this<br />\nyear is the best we have ever had and the<br />\nhardest. To win those last three games\u2014<br />\nSwarthmore, Mt. Washington and Toronto\u2014<br />\nwill call for the best team the \"Black and<br />\nBlue\" ever turned out, a team that shall be a<br />\nunit, and not a collection of individual stars.<br />\nEach man owes it to the University and to<br />\nhis mates on the team to do everything in his<br />\npower to put out the strongest team possible.<br />\nIt is not fair for one or two men to endanger<br />\nthe championship, which the others will so<br />\nearnestly strive for.<br />\nThe team is far from picked. Who will<br />\nplay second defense and who are going to get<br />\nthe home positions? These three places are<br />\nbeing eagerly fought for, and from the present<br />\noutlook it will take more than one game to<br />\nsift out the men and see who deserves the<br />\nplace. Ralph Williams, Herbert Price, Oliver<br />\nHopkins and H. L. Russell are all making<br />\nstrong bids for the defense position, while for<br />\nthe homes there are candidates galore, the<br />\nmost promising of which are Mathias, Ciary,<br />\nLowndes, Whitcraft, Stockett, Smith, Wilson<br />\nand Tappan. As yet, none have been proved<br />\nto be world-beaters.<br />\nThe trouble from time immemorial has been<br />\nto get the attack to work in properly, and this<br />\nyear bids fair to be a repetition of former<br />\nyears in that respect. It is to be hoped that<br />\nthings will be working properly by the time<br />\nthe first game comes off.<br />\nWas there ever a better schedule than the<br />\none arranged for the team this year? Those<br />\nlast three games in Baltimore will be great,<br />\nand if the students don't get behind the team<br />\nthen, they will never have a better chance.<br />\nThis year's schedule is worth a whole winter's<br />\ntraining for; there are enough games to look<br />\nforward to, and with all these fine games on<br />\nour own field Baltimore may expect to see<br />\nsome mighty good lacrosse. The manager<br />\nhas done his best to get a schedule; the players<br />\nwill do their best to bring back another<br /><br />\nchampionship banner, and it is up to the<br />\nstudents to do their best in the way of rooting. Let us have some support such as was<br />\ngiven the football team last fall, and there<br />\nwill not be much question as to the outcome<br />\nof the season, either from a financial or playing point of view.<br /><br />\nTHE CROSS COUNTRY RUN.<br />\nFrom the way the entries are coming in,<br />\nour cross country run, which will be held at<br />\nHomewood, Saturday, March 14, will afford<br />\nsome excellent sport. Lou Conners, of<br />\nWesleyan; Fleming, of George Washington<br />\nUniversity; Whit e, of the Bloomingdale<br />\nAthletic Club, have entered. Both the<br />\nWestern High School, of Washington, and<br />\nthe Cross Country Club, of this city, have also<br />\nentered teams of five men. Additional entries<br />\nare expected from Pennsylvania, Virginia and<br />\nother local organizations.<br />\nThe run will be conducted on the open<br />\nhandicap basis. A fine gold pendant medal<br />\nhas been donated by A. G. Spaulding &amp; Bros.<br />\nfor first prize, while silver and bronze medals<br />\nwill go to the second and third men. A banner will also be given to the team of four men<br />\nthat do the best work in scoring points.<br />\nThe run will start from Homewood at 2<br />\no'clock, and will go out Charles street avenue<br />\nto Belvedere, over Belvedere to Roland avenue;<br />\nthen to the car barn on the Falls Road and<br />\ndown the Falls Road to Cold Spring Lane,<br />\nthence to Roland avenue, Merryman's Lane,<br />\nback to Homewood.<br />\nThe Hopkins team will be picked from :<br />\nBrenton, Breyer, Griffith, Russell, Armstrong,<br />\nBurgan, Wolfe, Tappan and Reeside.<br /><br />\nTHE MEET.<br />\nOur meet was a great success this year.<br />\nBoth the open events and relay races brought<br />\nout some of the closest competition of the<br />\nyear. The speed with which the track events<br />\nwere run off sets a new mark for this city, for<br />\nshortly before 10 o'clock the last race was<br />\nover. Great credit is due Mr. Wylie, the<br />\nmanager of the track team, for the way in<br />\nwhich he overcame the very limited accom-<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nmodations of the cage, and caused the meet<br />\nto be such a financial and athletic success.<br />\nThe best feature, however, was that our<br />\nown track men won the meet with 17% points.<br />\nMount Washington landed second, with 15<br />\npoints. It was by the closest kind of a shave<br />\nthat we won our last 2Y4. points. Four men<br />\nwere tie in the pole vault with a jump of 10<br />\nfeet. Not one of these men could get over<br />\nthe bar at 10 feet, 6 inches, and according to<br />\nthe inter-collegiate rules the bar could<br />\nnot be lowered. So there the matter stood.<br />\nThe judges finally decided to split the points<br />\nand let the men draw for the medals. It is<br />\nsingular to remark that Bridgman, who scored<br />\nthe winning points for the Varsity, drew a<br />\nblank and received no medal.<br />\nOur men did excellent work in the distance.<br />\nIn the mile run Griffith and Breyer won first<br />\nand second places, while in the - half mile<br />\nBreyer and Wallis came in second and third.<br />\nThe mile race was a great one, and the time<br />\nis believed to have been the fastest ever made<br />\nin the cage. Griffith won by making a final<br />\nspurt that broke the tape only a few inches<br />\nahead of Breyer. .G. A. Stewart did good<br />\nwork in the 440, winning second place. Although both Baily and Stollenwerck qualified<br />\nin their heat in the 30-yard dash, neither<br />\nscored in the finals.<br />\nProbably the most interesting event of the<br />\nevening was the mile relay between the<br />\nJuniors and Freshmen. The race was exceedingly close, for never were the runners<br />\nmore than 5 or 6 yards apart. The first three<br />\nJuniors, Schneeberger, Wylie and Wallis, won<br />\na lead of about 5 yards on their opponents,<br />\nWolfe, Tappan and Burgan. Stollenwerck,<br />\nhowever, the last man for the Freshmen,<br />\ngradually overtook Baily, the Junior captain,<br />\nand passed him on the last quarter of a lap.<br /><br />\nthey succeeded in winning both the 1,000yard and mile runs. Brenton won the shorter<br />\nevent handily and finished second in the mile<br />\nrun, in which Breyer came first.<br /><br />\nTHE DANCE.<br />\nSince the Editorial on page 3 was put into<br />\ntype, May the ninth has been definitely fixed<br />\nfor the last dance of the Hopkins Cotillon<br />\nClub.<br /><br />\nALUMNI NOTES.<br />\nFrank Thorpe, '05, is a lieutenant in the<br />\nU.

This little<br />\npaper, (which is partly in Spanish and partly<br />\nin English), is exceedingly well done, and<br />\nwould cause considerable surprise to those<br />\nwho vaguely think of Porto Rico as a land of<br />\npalm-trees and fiestas and bull-fights.
