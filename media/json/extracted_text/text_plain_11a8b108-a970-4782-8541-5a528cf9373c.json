In the second quarter Coach<br />\nBrennick's men made the victors<br />\nlook like a high school eleven but<br />\ncould not realize on their chances<br />\nand finally lost the ball in vulnerable territory. The game was<br />\ncharacterized by frequent fumbles,<br />\nthe Black and Blue backfield being<br />\nthe more serious offenders, which<br />\ngave the Carlisle men their chance<br />\nto score. This poor playing was<br />\noffset by the most brilliant tackling seen at Homewood for some<br />\ntime. The work of Hecht and<br />\nWoodward showed that both are<br />\nmasters of defensive tactics.<br />\nWoodward has resumed his leadership of the team and is completing<br />\nhis course at the University while<br />\non furlough.<br />\nWinslow kicked off to Goldstein,<br />\nwho carried the ball back 5 yards<br />\nbefore he was downed. On the<br />\nnext play the Dickinson center<br />\nmade a high pass which Winslow<br />\nrecovered before the Red and<br />\nWhite men realized what had occurred. He fell on the ball instead<br />\nof picking it up on the run, and<br />\ndespite the fact that he scored it<br />\nwas Hopkins ball on the 15-yard<br />\nline with no score allowed.<br />\nHere Jones stood sponsor for a \u2022<br />\nseries of fumbles which finally resulted in Dickinson's first score.<br />\nAfter the Red and White recovered<br />\nthe ball they were held for downs<br />\nand forced to kick, Sheffey dropping the punt. Dickinson recovered and Captain Swope gained<br />\nconsistently through the line until<br />\nhe carried the ball over for the<br />\ninitial count. Goldstein kicked<br />\ngoal.<br />\nIn the second quarter the Black<br />\nand Blue team had things pretty<br />\nmuch its own way but could not<br />\ndevelop the punch to carry the ball<br />\nacross. After Sheffey ran through<br />\nthe Dickinson team for 25 yards<br />\nand Jones battered the line for a<br />\nfirst down the ball was lost on an<br />\nerror of generalship, when a forward pass was attempted on the<br />\n<br />\nThe entire time of the faculty<br />\nand many of the students of the<br />\ngeologieal department during the<br />\npast summer and early fall has<br />\nbeen taken up in work connected<br />\nwith the war. Prior to his death,<br />\nDr. W. B. Clark, former State geologist of Maryland, was at work<br />\non a report on the road materials<br />\nto be found locally which were<br />\nsuitable for the construction of<br />\nemergency roads along the entire<br />\nAtlantic Coast. Dr. E. B. Mathews, State geologist of Maryland,<br />\nas sub-chairman of the Research<br />\nCommittee of the National Council<br />\nof Defense has energetically carried on this work.<br />\nThe report is composed of facts<br />\ngathered in each of the States,<br />\nfrom Maine to Texas, by local geologists and highway engineers. It<br />\ncontains a digest of knowledge<br />\ncovering conditions of road construction, sources of road material<br />\nand the available road machinery<br />\nand men trained in road engineering in the several States.<br />\nIn studying the sources of road<br />\nmaterial, the several authors have<br />\nprepared maps showing not only<br />\nthe quarry sites and ledges, but<br />\nalso the stone walls and rock piles<br />\nwhich might be used in an emergency for building roads. When<br />\ncompleted, the report will present<br />\na more complete and extensive<br />\nsummary of conditions for highway construction than any which<br />\nhas been issued. The investigation, when completed, will be deposited with the War College of<br />\nthe Army.<br />\nMembers of the Geological Survey staff have also been preparing<br />\ngeneral and special reports on the<br />\nwater resources of Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia,<br />\nmaking special reports on the underground water conditions at<br />\nCamp Meade and other sites in<br />\nwhich the Army and Navy Departments are interested. This<br />\nwork has been chiefly in charge of<br />\nDr. Mathews and Associate Professor E. W. Berry.<br />\nDr. H. F. Reid, after returning<br />\nfrom the western front in July,<br />\nwas occupied with preparing his<br />\nreport to the National Research<br />\nCouncil and in making his recommendations to the Federal authorities. Later he investigated the<br />\npeculiarities of the compass used<br />\nin aeroplanes.<br />\nAssociate Professor J. T. Singewald has devoted several months<br />\nto the study of the deposits in<br />\nMaryland of minerals which yield<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins has been allotted a maximum quota of twentyfour men to be assigned on the<br />\nrecommendation of President<br />\nGoodnow to the Officers' Reserve<br />\nTraining Camps opening next<br />\nJanuary.<br />\nThe personnel of the January<br />\ncamps is to be composed primarily<br />\nof men selected from the various<br />\nbranches of the service. The colleges and universities having good<br />\nmilitary standing will, however,<br />\nall receive an allotment of appointments, each to be made on the<br />\nrecommendation of the president<br />\nof the institution.<br />\nThe men appointed must have<br />\nhad at least one year of military<br />\ntraining in addition to possessing<br />\nthe qualifications required of entrants in the former training<br />\ncamps. In view of the stringency<br />\nof the requirements it is improbable that the full quota allotted<br />\nto Johns Hopkins will be made<br />\nup. In order to preserve the good<br />\nmilitary standing of the University, only men in whose success<br />\nPresident Goodnow has every confidence will be recommended. It<br />\nis very probable that some of the<br />\nenlisted men now attending the<br />\nUniversity on furlough will be<br />\namong those appointed.<br />\nSpeaking last Saturday with regard to the formation.of the Hopkins corps, Captain Guild stated<br />\nthat the present arrangement of<br />\nthree companies would hold unless<br />\na fairly permanent personnel of<br />\nsuch size as to fully guarantee the<br />\nformation of an additional company should be found to exist.<br />\nCaptain Guild considers the formation of a new company on anything except a permanent basis<br />\nhighly undesirable.<br />\nArrangements as a result of<br />\nwhich the members of the Hopkins<br />\ncorps are to present a consistent<br />\nand soldierly appearance are<br />\nrapidly nearing completion. The<br />\ndetails of the uniform have now<br />\nbeen fully decided upon, and show<br />\nmany improvement and additions<br />\nover last year. The Hopkins uniform will have two distinctive features. By order of the War Department a bronze seal of the University will be worn on the collar.<br />\nIn addition, the members of the<br />\ncorps will wear a small silver University seal on the campaign hat.<br />\nA large proportion of the men<br />\nhave adopted the sheepskin lined<br />\nmilitary half-coat, and in all probability it will become part of the<br />\nregular equipment of all members<br />\nof the battalion.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 3, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nFOOTBALL IN WAR-TIME<br />\n<br />\nBy COACH BRENNICK<br />\nThe opening of the football season found conditions at Johns<br />\nHopkins in precisely the same<br />\nstatus as at the other prominent<br />\nuniversities\u2014the older men of the<br />\nupper classes had joined the various branches of the Army and<br />\nNavy with the result that the team<br />\nof necessity had to be constructed<br />\nin the main from new material or<br />\nfrom slightly experienced material. The consequence is that we<br />\nhave a younger, lighter and more<br />\ninexperienced team than usual;<br />\nindeed, one of the outstanding features of the games thus far played<br />\nhas been the comparative youthfulness of the Hopkins team as<br />\ncompared with its opponents.<br />\nThis is by no means a cause of<br />\nregret, but rather is an indication<br />\nof the manner in which the eligible<br />\nmen of the University responded<br />\nto the call to the colors. In the<br />\nBrown game five freshmen participated, viz.: Jones, Carey, Katencamp, Rouse and Gould. Another<br />\nfeature worthy of note is that by<br />\nfar the major portion of the squad<br />\nis composed of undergraduates,for<br />\nit was decided that no effort on<br />\nthe part of the athletic authorities or of any other persons was<br />\nto be exerted to have the medical<br />\nstudents play on the team. Four<br />\nmen from this school have come<br />\nout, but they are coming out quite<br />\nof their own volition and because<br />\nthey desire in this manner to secure their recreation.<br />\nThe squad, which now numbers<br />\nabout thirty-two men, has shown<br />\nthus far a very lively interest and<br />\nspirit; it is perhaps fair to say<br />\nthat it is the most spirited team<br />\nthat has represented the University in some years. The men realize that they are permitted to<br />\nplay at all simply because the governmental and University authorities feel that a combative sport<br />\nsuch as is football is an excellent<br />\ntraining for a man who may be<br />\ncalled later to fight for his country. The training of the squad is,<br />\nquite naturally, subordinated to<br />\nmilitary drill, so for this reason<br />\nno practice is held at all on Mondays, while on other afternoons<br />\nindividuals of the squad perform<br />\ntheir military duties according to<br />\ntheir scheduled assignments.<br />\nThe devolepment of the team,<br />\nwhich has in view, especially our<br />\ngames with the State teams, has<br />\nbeen gradual and somewhat slow,<br />\nbut it is none the less pleasing to<br />\nobserve the improvement of most<br />\nof the men. In the Brown game<br />\nthe team exceeded our hopes and<br />\nwon the admiration of the Brown<br />\nmen as well as of our own.

In the second quarter Coach<br />\nBrennick's men made the victors<br />\nlook like a high school eleven but<br />\ncould not realize on their chances<br />\nand finally lost the ball in vulnerable territory. The game was<br />\ncharacterized by frequent fumbles,<br />\nthe Black and Blue backfield being<br />\nthe more serious offenders, which<br />\ngave the Carlisle men their chance<br />\nto score. This poor playing was<br />\noffset by the most brilliant tackling seen at Homewood for some<br />\ntime. The work of Hecht and<br />\nWoodward showed that both are<br />\nmasters of defensive tactics.<br />\nWoodward has resumed his leadership of the team and is completing<br />\nhis course at the University while<br />\non furlough.<br />\nWinslow kicked off to Goldstein,<br />\nwho carried the ball back 5 yards<br />\nbefore he was downed. On the<br />\nnext play the Dickinson center<br />\nmade a high pass which Winslow<br />\nrecovered before the Red and<br />\nWhite men realized what had occurred. He fell on the ball instead<br />\nof picking it up on the run, and<br />\ndespite the fact that he scored it<br />\nwas Hopkins ball on the 15-yard<br />\nline with no score allowed.<br />\nHere Jones stood sponsor for a \u2022<br />\nseries of fumbles which finally resulted in Dickinson's first score.<br />\nAfter the Red and White recovered<br />\nthe ball they were held for downs<br />\nand forced to kick, Sheffey dropping the punt. Dickinson recovered and Captain Swope gained<br />\nconsistently through the line until<br />\nhe carried the ball over for the<br />\ninitial count. Goldstein kicked<br />\ngoal.<br />\nIn the second quarter the Black<br />\nand Blue team had things pretty<br />\nmuch its own way but could not<br />\ndevelop the punch to carry the ball<br />\nacross. After Sheffey ran through<br />\nthe Dickinson team for 25 yards<br />\nand Jones battered the line for a<br />\nfirst down the ball was lost on an<br />\nerror of generalship, when a forward pass was attempted on the<br /><br />\nThe entire time of the faculty<br />\nand many of the students of the<br />\ngeologieal department during the<br />\npast summer and early fall has<br />\nbeen taken up in work connected<br />\nwith the war. Prior to his death,<br />\nDr. W. B. Clark, former State geologist of Maryland, was at work<br />\non a report on the road materials<br />\nto be found locally which were<br />\nsuitable for the construction of<br />\nemergency roads along the entire<br />\nAtlantic Coast. Dr. E. B. Mathews, State geologist of Maryland,<br />\nas sub-chairman of the Research<br />\nCommittee of the National Council<br />\nof Defense has energetically carried on this work.<br />\nThe report is composed of facts<br />\ngathered in each of the States,<br />\nfrom Maine to Texas, by local geologists and highway engineers. It<br />\ncontains a digest of knowledge<br />\ncovering conditions of road construction, sources of road material<br />\nand the available road machinery<br />\nand men trained in road engineering in the several States.<br />\nIn studying the sources of road<br />\nmaterial, the several authors have<br />\nprepared maps showing not only<br />\nthe quarry sites and ledges, but<br />\nalso the stone walls and rock piles<br />\nwhich might be used in an emergency for building roads. When<br />\ncompleted, the report will present<br />\na more complete and extensive<br />\nsummary of conditions for highway construction than any which<br />\nhas been issued. The investigation, when completed, will be deposited with the War College of<br />\nthe Army.<br />\nMembers of the Geological Survey staff have also been preparing<br />\ngeneral and special reports on the<br />\nwater resources of Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia,<br />\nmaking special reports on the underground water conditions at<br />\nCamp Meade and other sites in<br />\nwhich the Army and Navy Departments are interested. This<br />\nwork has been chiefly in charge of<br />\nDr. Mathews and Associate Professor E. W. Berry.<br />\nDr. H. F. Reid, after returning<br />\nfrom the western front in July,<br />\nwas occupied with preparing his<br />\nreport to the National Research<br />\nCouncil and in making his recommendations to the Federal authorities. Later he investigated the<br />\npeculiarities of the compass used<br />\nin aeroplanes.<br />\nAssociate Professor J. T. Singewald has devoted several months<br />\nto the study of the deposits in<br />\nMaryland of minerals which yield<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins has been allotted a maximum quota of twentyfour men to be assigned on the<br />\nrecommendation of President<br />\nGoodnow to the Officers' Reserve<br />\nTraining Camps opening next<br />\nJanuary.<br />\nThe personnel of the January<br />\ncamps is to be composed primarily<br />\nof men selected from the various<br />\nbranches of the service. The colleges and universities having good<br />\nmilitary standing will, however,<br />\nall receive an allotment of appointments, each to be made on the<br />\nrecommendation of the president<br />\nof the institution.<br />\nThe men appointed must have<br />\nhad at least one year of military<br />\ntraining in addition to possessing<br />\nthe qualifications required of entrants in the former training<br />\ncamps. In view of the stringency<br />\nof the requirements it is improbable that the full quota allotted<br />\nto Johns Hopkins will be made<br />\nup. In order to preserve the good<br />\nmilitary standing of the University, only men in whose success<br />\nPresident Goodnow has every confidence will be recommended. It<br />\nis very probable that some of the<br />\nenlisted men now attending the<br />\nUniversity on furlough will be<br />\namong those appointed.<br />\nSpeaking last Saturday with regard to the formation.of the Hopkins corps, Captain Guild stated<br />\nthat the present arrangement of<br />\nthree companies would hold unless<br />\na fairly permanent personnel of<br />\nsuch size as to fully guarantee the<br />\nformation of an additional company should be found to exist.<br />\nCaptain Guild considers the formation of a new company on anything except a permanent basis<br />\nhighly undesirable.<br />\nArrangements as a result of<br />\nwhich the members of the Hopkins<br />\ncorps are to present a consistent<br />\nand soldierly appearance are<br />\nrapidly nearing completion. The<br />\ndetails of the uniform have now<br />\nbeen fully decided upon, and show<br />\nmany improvement and additions<br />\nover last year. The Hopkins uniform will have two distinctive features. By order of the War Department a bronze seal of the University will be worn on the collar.<br />\nIn addition, the members of the<br />\ncorps will wear a small silver University seal on the campaign hat.<br />\nA large proportion of the men<br />\nhave adopted the sheepskin lined<br />\nmilitary half-coat, and in all probability it will become part of the<br />\nregular equipment of all members<br />\nof the battalion.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 3, col. 3)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nFOOTBALL IN WAR-TIME<br /><br />\nBy COACH BRENNICK<br />\nThe opening of the football season found conditions at Johns<br />\nHopkins in precisely the same<br />\nstatus as at the other prominent<br />\nuniversities\u2014the older men of the<br />\nupper classes had joined the various branches of the Army and<br />\nNavy with the result that the team<br />\nof necessity had to be constructed<br />\nin the main from new material or<br />\nfrom slightly experienced material. The consequence is that we<br />\nhave a younger, lighter and more<br />\ninexperienced team than usual;<br />\nindeed, one of the outstanding features of the games thus far played<br />\nhas been the comparative youthfulness of the Hopkins team as<br />\ncompared with its opponents.<br />\nThis is by no means a cause of<br />\nregret, but rather is an indication<br />\nof the manner in which the eligible<br />\nmen of the University responded<br />\nto the call to the colors. In the<br />\nBrown game five freshmen participated, viz.: Jones, Carey, Katencamp, Rouse and Gould. Another<br />\nfeature worthy of note is that by<br />\nfar the major portion of the squad<br />\nis composed of undergraduates,for<br />\nit was decided that no effort on<br />\nthe part of the athletic authorities or of any other persons was<br />\nto be exerted to have the medical<br />\nstudents play on the team. Four<br />\nmen from this school have come<br />\nout, but they are coming out quite<br />\nof their own volition and because<br />\nthey desire in this manner to secure their recreation.<br />\nThe squad, which now numbers<br />\nabout thirty-two men, has shown<br />\nthus far a very lively interest and<br />\nspirit; it is perhaps fair to say<br />\nthat it is the most spirited team<br />\nthat has represented the University in some years. The men realize that they are permitted to<br />\nplay at all simply because the governmental and University authorities feel that a combative sport<br />\nsuch as is football is an excellent<br />\ntraining for a man who may be<br />\ncalled later to fight for his country. The training of the squad is,<br />\nquite naturally, subordinated to<br />\nmilitary drill, so for this reason<br />\nno practice is held at all on Mondays, while on other afternoons<br />\nindividuals of the squad perform<br />\ntheir military duties according to<br />\ntheir scheduled assignments.<br />\nThe devolepment of the team,<br />\nwhich has in view, especially our<br />\ngames with the State teams, has<br />\nbeen gradual and somewhat slow,<br />\nbut it is none the less pleasing to<br />\nobserve the improvement of most<br />\nof the men. In the Brown game<br />\nthe team exceeded our hopes and<br />\nwon the admiration of the Brown<br />\nmen as well as of our own.
