Therefore,<br />\nthey argue, ROTC should be<br />\nremoved from campus.<br />\nOthers disagree, however. The<br />\nCollege Republicans are currently<br />\ncirculating a petition that urges<br />\nthe University to continue its relationship with the ROTC.

The question is not the<br />\nstatus of ROTC now on the Homewood campus. But it<br />\nalso is not a coin toss between the rights and feelings of<br />\nmembers of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance and those of<br />\nthe ROTC cadets. The University must examine its relationship with ROTC and the role that the cadet batallion<br />\nplays on campus in relation to other organizations.<br />\nThe debate so far has maintained an emphasis on kneejerk emotions and defensiveness. But this kind of shortsightedness provokes a narrow, less sophisticated dialogue<br />\nand will make it easier for the administration to sweep the<br />\nissue\u2014and those who care about it\u2014aside. Input from and<br />\ninformation gathered by various campus groups and committees will be more relevant to Richardson's \"decision,\"<br />\nwhen he makes one, if it is directed towards more realistic<br />\ngoals.<br />\nThe absence of an immediate concrete resolution to this<br />\nissue does not mean that people on either side of the issue<br />\nshould stop educating themselves or expressing their views.<br />\nThe decison about ROTC is complicated; it brings to bear<br />\ninformation about several unexamined aspects of the<br />\nUniversity. It could provide a unique opportunity to bring<br />\nattention to the needs, contributions, and current status of<br />\nseveral groups\u2014including ROTC cadets and gay and lesbian students\u2014who were, until this issue arose, strangely<br />\nsilent.<br />\nMany of the questions concerning rights of members of<br />\nthis community and responsibilities of the University raised<br />\nby this issue are closely related to matters of concern<br />\nvehemently expressed in the infamous Human Climate<br />\nTask Force Report of several years ago. These issues were<br />\nimportant then and were identified as being in need of<br />\n<br />\nserious, immediate attention by the administration. Most<br />\nof them have not been discussed since the report was<br />\npublished and apparently have been forgotten by those who<br />\nprepared it and those to whom it was submitted. But those<br />\nissues could be addressed within this dialogue now, both<br />\nas they relate specifically to and as they affect the climate<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nThe ROTC issue has set the stage for an important<br />\ndialogue and has opened up several avenues of communication. Now members of the Hopkins community must accept this responsibility and participate in the dialogue. One<br />\nthing that everyone can do to contribute to this issue and<br />\nto the quality of life here at Hopkins is to fill out the survey<br />\nbeing circulated by the Committee on ROTC. It is time<br />\nto express views, contact President Richardson, and write<br />\nletters to him and to the committee. Not only will this help<br />\nto make the survey as a whole more valid and a more accurate representation of opinion (quantitatively), but it will<br />\nsend a message to Richardson, the Trustees, and hopefully to the DoD, that this issue is important and will not be<br />\nallowed to fall victim to apathy or purposeful neglect.<br />\nAt other universities, faculty members have played key<br />\nroles in framing the dialogue about the issue, exerting<br />\npressure on campus administration to address it, even taking steps toward putting pressure on the DoD. It is time<br />\nfor the Hopkins faculty to get involved. While most<br />\nstudents spend a limited amount of time directly affiliated<br />\nwith Hopkins, tenured faculty members bear the name and<br />\naffiliation for much longer. Their professional reputation<br />\nis shaped in part by the reputation of the institution. Their<br />\nwork, when published, carries the Hopkins name wherever<br />\nit goes, offering an implicit endorsement of the University as a whole, if not specific policies. Finally, faculty<br />\nmembers share their status with ROTC officers. The faculty here certainly could offer Richardson and the student<br />\nbody valuable insight and leadership.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br />\nEpisode Eight: Happy Quizlings<br />\nMiranda laid the newspaper<br />\nopen on the round wooden table<br />\nin the living room of apartment<br />\n311. Zack hovered over her as<br />\nshe flipped through the features<br />\nsection.<br />\n\"Turn to the Op/Ed section,\"<br />\nhe insisted.<br />\n\"I will,\" Miranda said, dwelling overlong on an article about<br />\nthe renovation of the president's<br />\nhouse, just to annoy Zack. She<br />\nknew what he wanted. He wanted<br />\nher to read his column.<br />\nZack wrote a column for the<br />\nOp/Ed section that among Miranda's friends was notorious for<br />\nboth its autobiographical content<br />\nand its banality. It was(or at least<br />\nit was supposed to be) a satiric<br />\nserial dealing with the amusing<br />\nlittle nuances of student life. The<br />\nonly thing Miranda found amusing about it was that it was supposed to be about her. Flattering,<br />\ncertainly, though it certainly<br />\ndidn't adhere much to how she<br />\nreally acted.<br />\n\"Come on, turn the page,\"<br />\nZack begged.<br />\n\"Don't whine, Zack.\"<br />\n\"I'm not,\" he whined.<br />\nMiranda knew there was no<br />\nhope for her here. She would<br />\nhave to read it and be honest with<br />\nZack. At least being honest with<br />\nhim was easy. She turned the<br />\npage.<br />\nThere it was, underneath the<br />\nstaff box. \"The Rachelle Story.\"<br />\nIt didn't even make sense. And<br />\nwhat kind of a name was<br />\nRachelle? Miranda couldn't picture herself as Rachelle.<br />\nShe skimmed it. It was<br />\nsomething about Doris being so<br />\nobsessed with oatmeal. Like<br />\npeople would find that at all funny. Get a life, Zack, she thought.<br />\n\"So what did you think?\"<br />\nZack asked, somehow looking up<br />\nat her, even though she was sitting down.<br />\n\"It was fine, Zack.\"<br />\n\"But what did you think?\" he<br />\ndemanded.<br />\nMiranda needed an escape.<br />\nWhere was Doris when you actually needed to be distracted?<br />\n<br />\n\"Well . . \" she began, and<br />\nthen inspiratiton struck. \"Zack,<br />\nyou want to do the quiz this<br />\nweek?\"<br />\nZack looked suspiciously at<br />\nher. \"Why?\"<br />\nMiranda scrambled to the back<br />\npage.<br />\n\"Look! It's the one-hit wonder<br />\nquiz. You like the one-hit wonder<br />\nquiz.\" My God, she thought. I<br />\nsound like Doris.<br />\n\"You like the one-hit wonder<br />\nquiz, Miranda. I think the quizzes<br />\nare all pretty stupid. I mean, who<br />\n<br />\n'I think the quizzes<br />\nare all pretty stupid,'<br />\nZack said. 'I mean,<br />\nwho cares if the QM<br />\nlikes Cop Rock?'<br />\n<br />\nreally cares about whether or not<br />\nthe QM likes Cop Rock?\"<br />\nZack had a point. But no way<br />\nwas she going to critique \"The<br />\nRachelle Story.\" There had to be<br />\na selling point.<br />\n\"Yeah, but you can help<br />\nme.. .1 don't know all of these.<br />\nto<br />\nlook. . .'Slave<br />\nAnd<br />\nLove'.. . isn't that a Bryan Ferry<br />\nsong?

Who is this<br />\nQuiz guy anyway'?\"<br />\n\"You've got me. Come on,<br />\nit'll be fun.\"<br />\nSomehow it worked.

I<br />\nagree with the premise that further<br />\ncounseling facilities would be<br />\nbeneficial, if not necessary, service<br />\nto the greatly expanded student<br />\npopulation across Charles Street.<br />\nHowever, I find it ridiculous that<br />\nsuch \"amenity\" would require use<br />\nof Senior Class Gift funding in order<br />\nto become a reality: why should<br />\nstudents have to pay rent on officially designated \"student activity<br />\nspace\" for a service that should be<br />\nprovided by the University in the<br />\nfirst place?<br />\nThis questionable University<br />\npolicy has prompted the Senior Class<br />\nGift Committe to consider use of its<br />\nlimited funds for another student<br />\ngroup: the radio station. The University has asked the student radio<br />\ngroup to cough up $3500 annually<br />\nfor use of the space behind Lazear,<br />\nin the dorms. As a -point of information, no rent has been paid on this<br />\nspace since the student radio station,<br />\nWJHU, was booted out four years<br />\nago. Now, a substantial student initiative is being shown to return what<br />\nwas, not long ago, a quality service<br />\n(more than once cited as Best of<br />\nBaltimore in City Paper) to the student body. The radio station would<br />\nalso create a dynamic opportunity,<br />\npresently absent from this fine institution, for students with an interest<br />\nin journalism and communications.<br />\nUnfortunately, the student radio<br />\ngroup's fundraising effort is still<br />\nabout $5000 short; the organization<br />\nis expected to ask Student Council<br />\nfor this money (\u00bd of Council's<br />\nbudget for the entire year) within the<br />\nmonth of November. From the<br />\noutset of the current movement for<br />\nstudent radio Dean Colombo has<br />\npledged his, and the University's,<br />\nsupport of the project. Why then<br />\ndoesn't the University waive the prohibitive $3500 rent for the unused/unremunerated 1.azear space,<br />\nthus clearing the way for a more<br />\nreasonable, and highly likely, Council allocation of $1500?<br />\nTwo points of note in this discussion: I) the Lazear space was not intended to generate revenue, and has<br />\nnot done so for at least the last four<br />\nyears; 2)the space was formerly used to its fullest by students in the accomplishment of a unique, and<br />\n<br />\npresently unavailable, service to the<br />\nstudent body. Why the University's<br />\nsudden drive to generate revenue<br />\nfrom this space, effectively blocking<br />\nstudent initiative? And should the<br />\nSenior Class Gift be relied upon to<br />\nprovide this opportunity for students,<br />\nor is that the role of a University<br />\nwhich has already has a poor track<br />\nrecord of valuing undergraduates?<br />\nP.S. Don't worry about misspelling<br />\nJonathan Kurtz's name in the article,<br />\nthe plaque underneath the tree in his<br />\nmemory (on the Freshman Quad)<br />\ncontains the very same error.<br />\nJeffrey M. Perlstein<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis letter is written in response<br />\nto the unfair and frustrating manner<br />\nin which the BIN is being conducted<br />\nthis year. This is by no means a personal complaint. Nor is it a particular \"gripe\" of my fraternity. I,<br />\nand many of my brothers, have had<br />\nnumerous discussions with members<br />\nof other fraternities about the blatantly partisan manner in which the BIA<br />\nhas been run. Perhaps some examples would demonstrate the situation best:<br />\nFirstly, the pairings of the flagfootball play-offs were suspect.<br />\nATO defeated DU during the regular<br />\nseason. Due to this fact we wondered<br />\nwhy we played FIJI in the opening<br />\nround of the play-offs while DU<br />\nplayed Sammy.<br />\nSecondly, the matter that the outdoor soccer tournament was run can<br />\nbest be described as a farce. DU<br />\nreceived the first-round bye in the<br />\ntournament (a position reserved for<br />\nthe past year's champion) even<br />\nthough ATO won the tournament<br />\n<br />\nlast year. After ATO beat Sammy on<br />\nthe morning of 10/27, we were told<br />\nthat we had to play DU immediately afterward. No rest, no advanced<br />\nnotice! We finally managed to have<br />\nthe game moved to the following<br />\nmorning against vehement opposition from DU. On the 28th, twenty<br />\nminutes past game time DU did not<br />\nhave enough players. When we inquired why the referee would not<br />\ndeclare a forfeit, we were informed<br />\nby the DU players that she had \"no<br />\nauthority\" to take this action. We<br />\nthought this extremely odd since she<br />\nis a member of the BIA Board.<br />\nWhen we announced our intention to<br />\ntake this matter to the BIA Board we<br />\nwere told (in a mocking and matterof-fact tone) by a DU brother,<br />\n\"What's the point? You know as<br />\nwell as I do that it won't be ruled a<br />\nforfeit.\" The referee for this semifinal game knew no rules of the<br />\ngame, by her own admission. To top<br />\nthis off, after DU lost, no referee<br />\nwas provided for the final against Sig<br />\nEp (the two teams made a noble effort officiating their own game).<br />\nThirdly, the indoor soccer has<br />\nbeen equally ruled by bias and incompetence. DU managed to escape<br />\nplaying the two best teams(ATO and<br />\nSig Ep) during the regular season,<br />\nbut during the first round ATO and<br />\nSig Ep were matched!<br />\nFourthly, the weekly \"BIA<br />\nNews\" article in the News-Letter<br />\nshould more aptly be named \"DU<br />\nNews\".<br />\nFinally, we would be interested<br />\nin learning more about the private<br />\nDU party at Charles Village Pub that<br />\nwas financed with BIA money.<br />\nEqually intriguing to us is how the<br />\nbill for this party was attempted to<br />\nbe stuck to the News-Letter. A final<br />\n<br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br />\n<br />\nquestion that arises is why is it so difficult for people who referee games<br />\nto be paid? Perhaps the last question<br />\nis directly related to the party at<br />\nCharles Village Pub'?<br />\nBIA is meant to be fair and enjoyable. The manner in which it is<br />\nbeing run this year has destroyed<br />\nboth of these objectives. The<br />\ncredibility of the entire process is<br />\ntarnished. The only positive effect<br />\nATO has received from this situation<br />\nis a growing feeling of respect and<br />\nempathy towards other fraternities,<br />\nespecially Sig Ep and FIJI. I have<br />\npurposely omitted reporting the<br />\nresults of the examples cited. The<br />\nresults are immaterial. What is important is the general actions and attitudes of the \"powers that be\" in<br />\nthe BIA. A possible solution may be<br />\na quota system for the BIA Board<br />\n(with the chairmanship rotating from<br />\nyear-to-year). The realistic difficulty of being elected to the BIA Board<br />\nis totally unsatisfactory. Perhaps<br />\npublicly calling attention to a situation that has many fraternities upset<br />\nwill produce a solution.

Instead of formulating a Republican<br />\nbudget without the Demnocrats'<br />\ntypical bureaucratic welfare garbage and then sticking with his<br />\nparty, Bush ignored pleas from<br />\nhis own party and compromised<br />\nwith the Democrats.

For those<br />\nnot familiar with the story of<br />\nClaus(Irons) and his wife Sunny<br />\n(Close), who mysteriously lapsed into an interminable coma in<br />\n1980 (after a brief coma a year<br />\nearlier), the events are quickly<br />\nsummarized by none other than<br />\nthe victim herself.<br />\nIt's a bold move by the<br />\nfilmmakers\u2014having Sunny narrate<br />\nthe film while lying chained to<br />\nmachines in a vegetative state\u2014<br />\nbut it works and serves notice.<br />\nThe script by Nicolas Kazen(At<br />\nClose Range), based on lawyer<br />\nAlan Dershowitz's book,<br />\nchallenges convention throughout,<br />\nshocking us with its wit and innovation, while Schroeder keeps<br />\nthe film moving without distraction.

Whether Claus actually<br />\ninjected the drugs or merely<br />\ndrove her to it is unclear, but Sunny clearly believes that he is to<br />\nblame. In her eyes, his appeal<br />\nbefore the Rhode Island Supreme<br />\nCourt after a conviction on two<br />\ncounts of attempted murder is not<br />\nan effort to reverse the verdict,<br />\nbut to escape from it.<br />\nSunny's version is only one of<br />\nmany presented.

Their<br />\npersonalities and styles are a<br />\nstudy in contrast: the energetic,<br />\nvolatile Dershowitz with his<br />\ntweed jackets and khaki pants,<br />\nand the drawling, dapper Von<br />\nBulow, with his smoking jackets,<br />\nsilk foulards, and dry savagely<br />\nwicked sense of humor.<br />\nIt is a tribute to Iron's performance in Reversal ofFortune that<br />\nhe manages to make Von Bulow<br />\n<br />\nPeter Pan Flies Triumphantly At The<br />\nMechanic With Cathy Rib In Starring Role<br />\nby Paul Kramer<br />\nHe wears green stockings and<br />\npointy shoes.

Lyne<br />\nis doing cheaply with a camera<br />\nwhat Rubin should be doing<br />\nthoughtfully with the pen.<br />\nAnd with such attention to<br />\noverpowering images, the<br />\nbalance is tipped so far in the<br />\ndirector's favor that it's impossible to muster any sympathy, even<br />\nfor someone as doomed as Jacob.<br />\nHe isn't developed enough to<br />\neven be uninteresting. We've<br />\nseen the internally wracked<br />\nveteran dozens of times before\u2014<br />\nwhat's new is Lyne's vision of the<br />\ninternal\u2014but the weirder Jacob's<br />\nvisions become, the less we care<br />\nabout the shell of a man experiencing them.<br />\nLyne gives his actors little<br />\nroom to work with, and they respond with expected discomfort.<br />\nPena is adequate as his companion, but Robbins seems especially puffy and overwhelmed by the<br />\ndownward spiral of his sickness.<br />\nAnd if Robbins looks dead<br />\nthroughout Jacob's Ladder, and<br />\nyou're wondering why a guy<br />\nwho's had his stomach slit open<br />\nby a bayonet doesn't have a scar,<br />\nlook to the overambitious,<br />\nthrowaway of an ending to create<br />\nmore questions than it can<br />\npossibly answer.<br />\nOf course, the actors are interchangeable and scripts irrelevant<br />\nin Lyne's \"startling new vision,\"<br />\nas Jacob's Ladder has been dubbed. It's all visual body blows, one<br />\nshock after another, none living<br />\nup to our own visions of what lies<br />\nbeyond life. The big questions remain unanswered\u2014after all,<br />\nthat's why they're big questions.<br />\nJacob's Ladder wants us to fear<br />\nhell, but the more pertinent<br />\nmessage is to fear movies about<br />\nit.<br />\n<br />\nPeter Pan Opens<br />\nContinued from page 7<br />\n<br />\nThe supporting performers,<br />\nwhile not as strong, are more than<br />\nsufficient to carry their roles. As<br />\nMrs. Darling, Lauren Thompson<br />\nis loving and concerned, though<br />\nshe seems to overact in her<br />\ndramatic exposition.

The initial screen<br />\ndepicts a striking, rooftop view<br />\nof London, and the first scene<br />\ntakes us inside the cozy Darling<br />\nhome.<br />\nAt the end of this scene, the<br />\nroom falls away to reveal a dark<br />\nfog-swept London, over which<br />\nthe children fly amid glowing<br />\nstars. When the curtain rose on<br />\nNeverland, a misty, primordial<br />\nworld of technicolor, the audience burst into applause at the<br />\nsight of the set alone. The flying,<br />\ndesigned by the Foy company,<br />\nwhich specializes in theatrical flying, is smoothly integrated into<br />\nthe action so that the illusion is<br />\nmaintained; you'll only see wires<br />\nif you're looking for them.<br />\nThere are also ironies in the<br />\nplay itself that emerge with<br />\nsuitable historical distance. If you<br />\ncan avoid a distinctively Freudian<br />\ninterpretation (the same actor as<br />\nFather and sword-swinging<br />\nadversary, the severing of a<br />\n\"hand,\" the desperate longing<br />\nfor Mother, etc.), you might have<br />\nfun watching the play affirm and<br />\nreaffirm conservative Victorian<br />\nvalues about family, order, and<br />\npatriotism.<br />\nTo the Indians, Peter is \"The<br />\nGreat White Father\" to their<br />\n\"brave, noble redskins.\" And<br />\nwith shades of Aristophanes' The<br />\nBirds, the Darlings reproduce the<br />\nContinued on page 9<br />\n<br />\nTEACH FOR AMERICA<br />\ninformation session<br />\nWednesday, November 14th<br />\n<br />\nLevering Hall 301<br />\n4:00 p.m.<br />\nTeach For America is a national teacher corps of<br />\ntalented, dedicated individuals from all ethnic<br />\nbackgrounds and academic majors who commit two<br />\nyears to teach in urban and rural areas that have<br />\npersistent teacher shortages.<br />\nfor more information contact Stacy Maltzman at 889-5750<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/9<br />\nby Stephen Kent Jusick<br />\nNot fitting into any category is a<br />\ntrip to Bertha's in historic Fell's<br />\nPoint for High Tea.

Dr. Dianne Tobin,<br />\nAssistant Director of the Division<br />\nof Education and Associate Professor of Education at the School<br />\nof Continuing Studies, is organizing a teaching certification program in response to the increasing number of students asking<br />\nDean Roseman as to how they<br />\ncan pursue a career in education<br />\nat Hopkins. An informational<br />\nmeeting for all those interested<br />\nwill be held this Tuesday,<br />\nNovember 13, from 4:00-6:00<br />\np.m., in Shaffer 3.<br />\nThis winter, a two week Intersession course dealing with<br />\nissues in education and career exploration in the teaching field will<br />\nbe offered. The class will deal<br />\nwith such issues as the underlying philosophy of U.S. schools<br />\nwhich distinguishes it from<br />\nschool systems in other countries,<br />\nnamely the belief that all students<br />\ncan learn. This creates a situation<br />\nin which the teacher tries to help<br />\nall the students grasp the material<br />\ninstead of setting up roadblocks<br />\nalong the way to winnow out the<br />\nless able students. In addition,<br />\npossibilities for expansion and advancement in the field of education will be discussed.<br />\nThe Masters of Arts and<br />\nTeaching requires a strong<br />\nbackground in the basic subjects<br />\ntaught in high school. Majors<br />\nsuch as Biology, English and<br />\nHistory are recommended instead<br />\nof more specialized subjects or<br />\ninterdisciplinary<br />\nmajors.<br />\nFreshmen and Sophomores<br />\nuncertain about their choice of<br />\nmajor are encouraged to talk to<br />\nDr. Tobin.<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduates would apply<br />\nfor the program at the end of their<br />\njunior year and then proceed to<br />\ntake courses from the School of<br />\nContinuing Studies over the summer before their senior year.<br />\nThese courses would include<br />\n\"Educational Psychology: Learning,\" \"Human Growth and<br />\nDevelopment,\" and \"Secondary<br />\nCurriculum,\" the last of which is<br />\nnine credits.<br />\nFollowing their senior year,<br />\nstudents would take \"Maintaining the Exceptional Child,\"<br />\n\"Methods of Teaching in Secondary School,\" and \"Tests and<br />\nMeasurements,\" the last one<br />\nagain being nine credits. Students<br />\nwould then be prepared to recieve<br />\na teaching certificattion with one<br />\nmore requirement of nine credits<br />\nof student teaching.<br />\nDr. Tobin is looking into an<br />\noption to allow graduates to begin<br />\nteaching right away, in the fall of<br />\ntheir first year out of Hopkins.<br />\nShe hopes to get the Baltimore city schools to allow students to<br />\nbegin working under a supervisor<br />\nand mentor. As of yet, though,<br />\na method of finding jobs for individuals in this program has not<br />\nbeen formalized.<br />\nThe overall objective of this<br />\nprogram is to get good liberal arts<br />\nstudents into teaching more<br />\nquickly than through the normal<br />\nroute. Typically, a student who<br />\ngraduates with a liberal arts<br />\ndegree would have to get a<br />\nMasters as well. Demand for<br />\nstudents with a solid background<br />\nin liberal arts instead of a<br />\nbachelor's degree in education is<br />\nhigh and educators are doing all<br />\nthey can to draw the best and<br />\nbrightest into teaching. Dr. Tobin<br />\npredicts most.of the interest will<br />\ncome from students in the math<br />\nand science departments instead<br />\nof those in the social sciences and<br />\nhumanities.<br />\nDr. Tobin sees two sweeping<br />\nforces in this country as pointing<br />\n<br />\ntoward a trend toward the<br />\nteaching profession. First, there<br />\nhas been a great deal of publicity<br />\nfor the notion that it should be<br />\nmade easier for the bright, liberal<br />\narts students to enter teaching.<br />\nDr. Tobin sees this as a response<br />\nto teacher shortages and a lack of<br />\nexpertise in those teachers currently available. Programs such<br />\nas Teach For America, which<br />\nholds a brief orientation program<br />\nfor students who have just<br />\ngraduated and sends them to teach<br />\nin areas where teacher shortages<br />\nare a major problem, respond and<br />\nencourage students to enter into<br />\nteaching.<br />\nThe second force leading to this<br />\n<br />\nnationwide trend is the shift of the<br />\nmentality away from that which<br />\nproduced the kinds of students<br />\nwho went into finance, investment, and law to one more interested in social problems and<br />\njob satisfaction. Dr. Tobin sees<br />\nthe 1990's as bringing a different<br />\ntype of student into the world,<br />\none interested in helping others,<br />\ninterested in a \"meaningful occupation.\" She sees social concern as replacing power and<br />\nwealth as motivating forces.<br />\nDr. Tobin cites several instances in which people in the<br />\nbusiness world making $80,000<br />\nand $90,000 a year come to her<br />\nwanting a Masters in Arts and<br />\n<br />\nTeaching. Reasons for this vary.<br />\nTobin points out that there is a<br />\nmore \"collegial atmospohere\"<br />\namong teachers instead of the<br />\nharsh competitiveness in other<br />\nfields. In addition, people are<br />\nlooking more to \"life satisfaction\" and time with their family<br />\nand friends outside of work. No<br />\nother profession allows for a three<br />\nmonth vacation every year. She<br />\ncites the -yearly renewal\" of<br />\nhaving a new class with a different character every year<br />\npreventing the stagnation of dealing with the same people every<br />\nday.<br />\nThese tremendous advantages<br />\nare just beginning to be noticed,<br />\n<br />\n1400<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\nToachers<br />\nThoustmds<br />\n1300<br />\n<br />\n1200<br />\n<br />\n100-0<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n1980<br />\n<br />\n1 982<br />\n<br />\nby Jessica Maxwell<br />\nLocated inside the Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art, the Art Museum<br />\nCafe is a fairly easy walk from<br />\ncampus and most of Charles<br />\nVillage.

However, F&M's<br />\nquarterback was intercepted three<br />\ntimes by the ball hawking Jays<br />\nlate in the game to preserve the<br />\nvictory.

You've<br />\nrescued me from another week<br />\nwithout a good injury, and inspired this new and innovative<br />\ninteractive format. The condition you've described is commonly<br />\ncalled \"saddle<br />\nsoreness,\" and is a common<br />\nailment among cyclists. It is<br />\nessentially a cramp of the<br />\nmuscles which are being pressed against the bicycle seat. So,<br />\ntell me something I don't<br />\nknow. The reason this condition is so common is that,<br />\nwhile you are sustaining muscle contraction in that area, the<br />\npressure that pesky seat is exerting is obstructing the blood<br />\nsupply to the area. Like shin<br />\nsplints, the condition is often<br />\ninevitable in early training<br />\n(especially with a seat that's<br />\nnot broken-in). Stretching<br />\nbefore riding can help alleviate<br />\nthe condition. The most<br />\nhelpful stretch is the low-back<br />\nstretch, in which you lie on<br />\nyour back, lift your knee to<br />\nyour chest, and hold it for 10<br />\nseconds. Repeat this procedure<br />\n10-20 times with each leg.<br />\nLow sodium and potassium<br />\nlevels also cause cramps, so<br />\neat your bananas. Readers, this<br />\nis only the beginning.

Five minutes after the<br />\nfirst try, Hopkins scored again in<br />\nan electrifying fashion to stun the<br />\nS.A.I.S. team. It came off of a<br />\nhigh pop kick which a S.A.I.S.<br />\nplayer tried to field. Hopkins'<br />\ncoverage got to him at the same<br />\ntime as the ball and popped the<br />\nball right into the hands of<br />\nfreshman lock Bill Covig, who<br />\nlumbered 30 meters for the try.<br />\nThe points after both tries were<br />\nmissed, and the hald ended with<br />\nHopkins leading, 11-6.<br />\nThe second half was all<br />\nHopkins as they dominated every<br />\nfacet of the game. Freshmen<br />\nsubstitutes who had filled in continued ihe onslaught against a tir-<br />\n<br />\ning and demoralized S.A.I.S.<br />\nsquad. Five minutes into the half,<br />\njunior 8 man Julian Edwards took<br />\nthe ball off the scrum on a keeper<br />\nto score. This put him in the lead<br />\nwith 3 tries for the season and for<br />\nthe much coveted award that goes<br />\nto the team's leading scorer. The<br />\nnext score highlighted Hopkins'<br />\nball supporting abilities. The ball<br />\nwas passed down the back line to<br />\ncreate a 2 on 1 at the wind.<br />\nHopkins took advantage of this<br />\nand passed off to sophomore<br />\nwinger Josh Flowers, who blazed in for his second try of the<br />\nseason. By this time, S.A.I.S.<br />\nwas completely out of the game<br />\nand had generated no scoring<br />\nthreat. Luck, though, was also<br />\nwith the Hopkins team. A loose<br />\nball had rolled into the S.A.1.S.<br />\ntry zone, and three players dived for it. A S.A.I.S. player<br />\nmanaged to grab the ball thr what<br />\nwould be a touchback, but Cort<br />\nMcMeel and Scott Haag wrestled the ball away from him just as<br />\nthe referee came by. The try was<br />\nawarded to Hopkins and credited<br />\n<br />\nto Cort McMeel for his first try<br />\nof the season. After the game,<br />\nMcMeel stated, \"I want people<br />\nto know that I scored the dirtiest,<br />\ncheapest try in Hopkins rugby<br />\nhistory,\" to which a chorus of<br />\nwhy's were heard. The final<br />\nscore came off of an assist by<br />\nHopkins coach Frank Deerdon,<br />\nwho had come in as a prop in the<br />\nsecond half. The 50 plus<br />\ncoach/player showed flashes of<br />\nChristian Okoye in his running<br />\nstyle (although Okoye has most<br />\nof his muscle around his chest and<br />\nthighs, Deerdon has his around<br />\nthe girth). Deerdon managed to<br />\nbull his way to the 22 before<br />\ndishing off to Bill Covig, who<br />\nbroke tackles and pirouetted his<br />\nway forward until he discovered<br />\nthat he was in the try zone. All<br />\nfour points after were missed by<br />\nHopkins, so the final score stood<br />\nat 27-6.<br />\nHopkins will end its season<br />\nagainst a tough St. Mary's College team, which crushed them<br />\nlast season. on Saturday at<br />\n12:30 p.m. on the B1A field<br />\n<br />\nan injury.

Therefore,<br />\nthey argue, ROTC should be<br />\nremoved from campus.<br />\nOthers disagree, however. The<br />\nCollege Republicans are currently<br />\ncirculating a petition that urges<br />\nthe University to continue its relationship with the ROTC. President Dan Abrams said that the<br />\ngroup has collected an estimated<br />\n150 to 200 signatures thus far.<br />\nThe petition states that ROTC<br />\nis an important source of scholarship money at a time when<br />\nHopkins is increasing its tuition<br />\nin the midst of a nationwide<br />\neconomic crisis. Last year the<br />\nHopkins ROTC unit gave 36 of<br /><br />\nBret Akers<br /><br />\nHopkins' ROTC cadets continue to train while administrators and student organizations evaluate the program.<br /><br />\nits 55 cadets a total of $474,350<br />\nin scholarship money.<br />\nEarly next month Richardson<br />\nwill examine the findings of<br />\nseveral campus committees that<br />\nhave been formed to investigate<br />\nthe issue. The president also plans<br />\nto review the policies of Hopkins'<br />\npeer institutions that have ROTC<br />\nprograms.<br />\nIn a recent telephone interview,<br />\nRichardson stressed that he will<br />\nstudy all the options presented to<br />\nhim, and said that if the University were to adopt a policy regarding the ROTC, it would likely<br />\nbe similar to the one used by the<br />\nMassachusetts Institute of<br />\nTechnology (MIT).<br />\nThat policy, according to the<br />\nOctober 24 issue of Tech Talk,<br />\nMIT's official newspaper, states<br />\nthat in five years the MIT president's task force \"[will] recommend that ROTC be made<br />\nunavailable to students beginning<br />\nwith the class of 1998 if there has<br />\nbeen inadequate progress toward<br />\neliminating the DOD's policy on<br />\nsexual orientation.\"<br />\nWhile such a policy might<br />\nmean years before Hopkins<br />\nwould even consider a disaffiliation with ROTC, Richardson<br />\nsaid, \"I don't like the IROTC's<br />\nsexual orientation] policy, and a<br />\ncollaboration between Hopkins<br />\nand institutions like MIT will occur much sooner in order to bring<br />\npressure to bear on Congress and<br />\nthe DOD to change the policy.\"<br />\nEarly this year the DOD con-<br /><br />\nsidered phasing out the Hopkins<br />\nROTC program, apparently<br />\nbecause of low enrollment. But<br />\naccording to Capt. Richard<br />\nPlasket, the DOD reevaluated<br />\nHopkins' program, and by July<br />\ndecided to continue it because it<br />\nhas produced such high-caliber<br />\nlieutenants in the past.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins' program is<br />\nsmall in relation to ROTC programs at other universities, it has<br />\nincreased enrollment by approximately 10 cadets per year over<br />\nthe past three years, bringing the<br />\ntotal to just over 55.<br />\nBut Paul DelGrosso, president<br />\nof GALA, suggests that these<br />\nfigures are deceptive. \"The only reason there has been a slight<br />\nincrease in cadets,\" he said, \"is<br />\nthat there has been a dramatic increase in the student population<br />\nat Hopkins overall.\"<br />\nSuch points of contention may<br />\nbe resolved next month when<br />\nRichardson reviews the findings<br />\nof the President's Ad Hoc Committee on ROTC, which will next<br />\nweek circulate a survey to all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community soliciting their opinions<br />\non the issue.<br />\nThe results of the survey will<br />\nbe cpsidered by the deans, the<br />\npresident, and the board of<br />\ntrustees when they decide on the<br />\nUniversity's course of action<br />\ntoward the ROTC policy next<br />\nyear.<br />\nSeveral people have raised conContinued on page 2<br /><br />\nNew Hopkins' Pre-Law Program<br />\nFirst To Focus on Ancient Law<br />\nby Christian DeRuiter<br />\nA new minor in Ancient Law<br />\nwill be offered next year through<br />\nthe Departments of Classics and<br />\nNear Eastern Studies.

This sort of negative<br />\ndefinition, Branch said, emerged<br />\nmost powerfully in the years<br />\n1966-67, when the Black Power<br />\nand Jewish Pride movements<br />\nerupted simultaneously.<br />\nAlthough racial or religious<br />\npride usually carries good connotations, Branch said, this \"explosion of pride\" instead caused<br />\nsomething of a \"national<br />\nretreat.\" As a result, he said,<br />\nAmerican society became increasingly fragmented.<br />\n\"We've turned inward ever<br />\nsince,\" he observed.

He speculated on<br /><br />\nthe degree to which \"an<br />\nautocratic leadership can be put<br />\nin the service of a democratic<br />\ncause.\" This question, he added,<br />\nwas highly pertinent during the<br />\ncivil rights movement, when the<br />\ndemocratic ideals of the cause<br />\nwere sometimes lost among the<br />\nagendas of individual leaders.<br />\nFor better or worse, Branch<br />\nsaid, the identity issue has shaped<br />\n\"the way [in which different<br />\ngroups] rub together and the way<br />\nwe think of one another.\"<br />\nAs groups have politically and<br />\ncloistered<br />\nideologically<br />\nthemselves, he said, the net result<br />\nhas been a society with a narrower vision of itself and of its<br />\nfuture.<br />\n\"What we see as possible between us and among us has suffered and been reduced,\" he said.<br />\nThe News-Letter: Spreading it<br />\naround since 1897.<br /><br />\nIn an effort to gauge<br />\nundergraduates attitudes toward<br />\nthe issue more accurately, the<br />\nHuman Relations and Campus<br />\nDiversity Committee is conducting a telephone survey of 114<br />\nrandomly selected Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nDelGrosso, who organized the<br />\nsurvey, said that 80 students have<br />\nbeen contacted thus far. The<br />\nresults are expected to be<br />\ntabulated next week.<br />\n\"The current results are surprising,\" he said. \"In a school<br />\nthat considers itself so intellectual<br />\nand educated, students are<br />\ngenerally willing to accept the<br />\nDOD's policy without proof, yet<br />\nthey agree with Hopkins' nondiscriminatory policy towards<br />\ngays and lesbians.\"<br />\nDelGrosso added that GALA<br />\nhas asked a city agency to help<br />\nit invesitigate whether Baltimore<br />\nordinance 79, article 4, which<br />\nprotects gays and lesbians from<br />\ndiscrimination in employment<br />\nand education, can be applied to<br />\nHopkins' ROTC program.<br />\nAll decisions on such issues,<br />\nhowever, will eventually be made<br />\nby the Board of Trustees.<br />\nChairman of the Board of<br />\nTrustees Morris W.

The question is not the<br />\nstatus of ROTC now on the Homewood campus. But it<br />\nalso is not a coin toss between the rights and feelings of<br />\nmembers of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance and those of<br />\nthe ROTC cadets. The University must examine its relationship with ROTC and the role that the cadet batallion<br />\nplays on campus in relation to other organizations.<br />\nThe debate so far has maintained an emphasis on kneejerk emotions and defensiveness. But this kind of shortsightedness provokes a narrow, less sophisticated dialogue<br />\nand will make it easier for the administration to sweep the<br />\nissue\u2014and those who care about it\u2014aside. Input from and<br />\ninformation gathered by various campus groups and committees will be more relevant to Richardson's \"decision,\"<br />\nwhen he makes one, if it is directed towards more realistic<br />\ngoals.<br />\nThe absence of an immediate concrete resolution to this<br />\nissue does not mean that people on either side of the issue<br />\nshould stop educating themselves or expressing their views.<br />\nThe decison about ROTC is complicated; it brings to bear<br />\ninformation about several unexamined aspects of the<br />\nUniversity. It could provide a unique opportunity to bring<br />\nattention to the needs, contributions, and current status of<br />\nseveral groups\u2014including ROTC cadets and gay and lesbian students\u2014who were, until this issue arose, strangely<br />\nsilent.<br />\nMany of the questions concerning rights of members of<br />\nthis community and responsibilities of the University raised<br />\nby this issue are closely related to matters of concern<br />\nvehemently expressed in the infamous Human Climate<br />\nTask Force Report of several years ago. These issues were<br />\nimportant then and were identified as being in need of<br /><br />\nserious, immediate attention by the administration. Most<br />\nof them have not been discussed since the report was<br />\npublished and apparently have been forgotten by those who<br />\nprepared it and those to whom it was submitted. But those<br />\nissues could be addressed within this dialogue now, both<br />\nas they relate specifically to and as they affect the climate<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nThe ROTC issue has set the stage for an important<br />\ndialogue and has opened up several avenues of communication. Now members of the Hopkins community must accept this responsibility and participate in the dialogue. One<br />\nthing that everyone can do to contribute to this issue and<br />\nto the quality of life here at Hopkins is to fill out the survey<br />\nbeing circulated by the Committee on ROTC. It is time<br />\nto express views, contact President Richardson, and write<br />\nletters to him and to the committee. Not only will this help<br />\nto make the survey as a whole more valid and a more accurate representation of opinion (quantitatively), but it will<br />\nsend a message to Richardson, the Trustees, and hopefully to the DoD, that this issue is important and will not be<br />\nallowed to fall victim to apathy or purposeful neglect.<br />\nAt other universities, faculty members have played key<br />\nroles in framing the dialogue about the issue, exerting<br />\npressure on campus administration to address it, even taking steps toward putting pressure on the DoD. It is time<br />\nfor the Hopkins faculty to get involved. While most<br />\nstudents spend a limited amount of time directly affiliated<br />\nwith Hopkins, tenured faculty members bear the name and<br />\naffiliation for much longer. Their professional reputation<br />\nis shaped in part by the reputation of the institution. Their<br />\nwork, when published, carries the Hopkins name wherever<br />\nit goes, offering an implicit endorsement of the University as a whole, if not specific policies. Finally, faculty<br />\nmembers share their status with ROTC officers. The faculty here certainly could offer Richardson and the student<br />\nbody valuable insight and leadership.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br />\nEpisode Eight: Happy Quizlings<br />\nMiranda laid the newspaper<br />\nopen on the round wooden table<br />\nin the living room of apartment<br />\n311.

I<br />\nagree with the premise that further<br />\ncounseling facilities would be<br />\nbeneficial, if not necessary, service<br />\nto the greatly expanded student<br />\npopulation across Charles Street.<br />\nHowever, I find it ridiculous that<br />\nsuch \"amenity\" would require use<br />\nof Senior Class Gift funding in order<br />\nto become a reality: why should<br />\nstudents have to pay rent on officially designated \"student activity<br />\nspace\" for a service that should be<br />\nprovided by the University in the<br />\nfirst place?<br />\nThis questionable University<br />\npolicy has prompted the Senior Class<br />\nGift Committe to consider use of its<br />\nlimited funds for another student<br />\ngroup: the radio station. The University has asked the student radio<br />\ngroup to cough up $3500 annually<br />\nfor use of the space behind Lazear,<br />\nin the dorms. As a -point of information, no rent has been paid on this<br />\nspace since the student radio station,<br />\nWJHU, was booted out four years<br />\nago. Now, a substantial student initiative is being shown to return what<br />\nwas, not long ago, a quality service<br />\n(more than once cited as Best of<br />\nBaltimore in City Paper) to the student body. The radio station would<br />\nalso create a dynamic opportunity,<br />\npresently absent from this fine institution, for students with an interest<br />\nin journalism and communications.<br />\nUnfortunately, the student radio<br />\ngroup's fundraising effort is still<br />\nabout $5000 short; the organization<br />\nis expected to ask Student Council<br />\nfor this money (\u00bd of Council's<br />\nbudget for the entire year) within the<br />\nmonth of November. From the<br />\noutset of the current movement for<br />\nstudent radio Dean Colombo has<br />\npledged his, and the University's,<br />\nsupport of the project. Why then<br />\ndoesn't the University waive the prohibitive $3500 rent for the unused/unremunerated 1.azear space,<br />\nthus clearing the way for a more<br />\nreasonable, and highly likely, Council allocation of $1500?<br />\nTwo points of note in this discussion: I) the Lazear space was not intended to generate revenue, and has<br />\nnot done so for at least the last four<br />\nyears; 2)the space was formerly used to its fullest by students in the accomplishment of a unique, and<br /><br />\npresently unavailable, service to the<br />\nstudent body. Why the University's<br />\nsudden drive to generate revenue<br />\nfrom this space, effectively blocking<br />\nstudent initiative? And should the<br />\nSenior Class Gift be relied upon to<br />\nprovide this opportunity for students,<br />\nor is that the role of a University<br />\nwhich has already has a poor track<br />\nrecord of valuing undergraduates?<br />\nP.S. Don't worry about misspelling<br />\nJonathan Kurtz's name in the article,<br />\nthe plaque underneath the tree in his<br />\nmemory (on the Freshman Quad)<br />\ncontains the very same error.<br />\nJeffrey M. Perlstein<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis letter is written in response<br />\nto the unfair and frustrating manner<br />\nin which the BIN is being conducted<br />\nthis year. This is by no means a personal complaint. Nor is it a particular \"gripe\" of my fraternity. I,<br />\nand many of my brothers, have had<br />\nnumerous discussions with members<br />\nof other fraternities about the blatantly partisan manner in which the BIA<br />\nhas been run. Perhaps some examples would demonstrate the situation best:<br />\nFirstly, the pairings of the flagfootball play-offs were suspect.<br />\nATO defeated DU during the regular<br />\nseason. Due to this fact we wondered<br />\nwhy we played FIJI in the opening<br />\nround of the play-offs while DU<br />\nplayed Sammy.<br />\nSecondly, the matter that the outdoor soccer tournament was run can<br />\nbest be described as a farce. DU<br />\nreceived the first-round bye in the<br />\ntournament (a position reserved for<br />\nthe past year's champion) even<br />\nthough ATO won the tournament<br /><br />\nlast year. After ATO beat Sammy on<br />\nthe morning of 10/27, we were told<br />\nthat we had to play DU immediately afterward. No rest, no advanced<br />\nnotice! We finally managed to have<br />\nthe game moved to the following<br />\nmorning against vehement opposition from DU. On the 28th, twenty<br />\nminutes past game time DU did not<br />\nhave enough players. When we inquired why the referee would not<br />\ndeclare a forfeit, we were informed<br />\nby the DU players that she had \"no<br />\nauthority\" to take this action. We<br />\nthought this extremely odd since she<br />\nis a member of the BIA Board.<br />\nWhen we announced our intention to<br />\ntake this matter to the BIA Board we<br />\nwere told (in a mocking and matterof-fact tone) by a DU brother,<br />\n\"What's the point? You know as<br />\nwell as I do that it won't be ruled a<br />\nforfeit.\" The referee for this semifinal game knew no rules of the<br />\ngame, by her own admission. To top<br />\nthis off, after DU lost, no referee<br />\nwas provided for the final against Sig<br />\nEp (the two teams made a noble effort officiating their own game).<br />\nThirdly, the indoor soccer has<br />\nbeen equally ruled by bias and incompetence. DU managed to escape<br />\nplaying the two best teams(ATO and<br />\nSig Ep) during the regular season,<br />\nbut during the first round ATO and<br />\nSig Ep were matched!<br />\nFourthly, the weekly \"BIA<br />\nNews\" article in the News-Letter<br />\nshould more aptly be named \"DU<br />\nNews\".<br />\nFinally, we would be interested<br />\nin learning more about the private<br />\nDU party at Charles Village Pub that<br />\nwas financed with BIA money.<br />\nEqually intriguing to us is how the<br />\nbill for this party was attempted to<br />\nbe stuck to the News-Letter. A final<br /><br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br /><br />\nquestion that arises is why is it so difficult for people who referee games<br />\nto be paid? Perhaps the last question<br />\nis directly related to the party at<br />\nCharles Village Pub'?<br />\nBIA is meant to be fair and enjoyable. The manner in which it is<br />\nbeing run this year has destroyed<br />\nboth of these objectives. The<br />\ncredibility of the entire process is<br />\ntarnished. The only positive effect<br />\nATO has received from this situation<br />\nis a growing feeling of respect and<br />\nempathy towards other fraternities,<br />\nespecially Sig Ep and FIJI. I have<br />\npurposely omitted reporting the<br />\nresults of the examples cited. The<br />\nresults are immaterial. What is important is the general actions and attitudes of the \"powers that be\" in<br />\nthe BIA. A possible solution may be<br />\na quota system for the BIA Board<br />\n(with the chairmanship rotating from<br />\nyear-to-year). The realistic difficulty of being elected to the BIA Board<br />\nis totally unsatisfactory. Perhaps<br />\npublicly calling attention to a situation that has many fraternities upset<br />\nwill produce a solution. To that end<br />\nwe are sending copies of this letter<br />\nto all fraternities and the SAC<br />\nOffice.<br />\nMichael L.

For those<br />\nnot familiar with the story of<br />\nClaus(Irons) and his wife Sunny<br />\n(Close), who mysteriously lapsed into an interminable coma in<br />\n1980 (after a brief coma a year<br />\nearlier), the events are quickly<br />\nsummarized by none other than<br />\nthe victim herself.<br />\nIt's a bold move by the<br />\nfilmmakers\u2014having Sunny narrate<br />\nthe film while lying chained to<br />\nmachines in a vegetative state\u2014<br />\nbut it works and serves notice.<br />\nThe script by Nicolas Kazen(At<br />\nClose Range), based on lawyer<br />\nAlan Dershowitz's book,<br />\nchallenges convention throughout,<br />\nshocking us with its wit and innovation, while Schroeder keeps<br />\nthe film moving without distraction.

Whether Claus actually<br />\ninjected the drugs or merely<br />\ndrove her to it is unclear, but Sunny clearly believes that he is to<br />\nblame. In her eyes, his appeal<br />\nbefore the Rhode Island Supreme<br />\nCourt after a conviction on two<br />\ncounts of attempted murder is not<br />\nan effort to reverse the verdict,<br />\nbut to escape from it.<br />\nSunny's version is only one of<br />\nmany presented.

Their<br />\npersonalities and styles are a<br />\nstudy in contrast: the energetic,<br />\nvolatile Dershowitz with his<br />\ntweed jackets and khaki pants,<br />\nand the drawling, dapper Von<br />\nBulow, with his smoking jackets,<br />\nsilk foulards, and dry savagely<br />\nwicked sense of humor.<br />\nIt is a tribute to Iron's performance in Reversal ofFortune that<br />\nhe manages to make Von Bulow<br /><br />\nPeter Pan Flies Triumphantly At The<br />\nMechanic With Cathy Rib In Starring Role<br />\nby Paul Kramer<br />\nHe wears green stockings and<br />\npointy shoes.

Burton, her<br />\nboyfriend, is the most superficial<br />\nof the characters, whose purpose<br />\nin the play is to augment Anna's<br />\nconflict. He is presented as an intelligent, boring man with very<br />\nlittle outstanding about him at all.<br />\nLarry, Anna's homosexual<br />\nroommate, is in a way the voice<br />\nof wisdom here. He is the objective by-stander watching Anna's<br />\nconflict, and as such, he notices<br />\nwhat others do not, and points out<br />\nwhat others have missed. His<br />\ndistinctive personality helps lend<br /><br />\nrealism to the play. Pale is the exciting force that drives the play,<br />\nstirring Anna's emotions. He is<br />\nmostly drunk, loud and obnoxious, but is still likeable. His<br />\nflaws as a character make him<br />\nvery human and remarkably<br />\nfunny.<br />\nThe opening scene consists<br />\nmainly of expository dialogue<br />\nbetween Anna, Larry and Burton,<br />\nwhich introduces the characters<br />\nand their background. While this<br />\nexposition does not immediately<br />\ngrab the audience's attention, the<br />\naction slowly builds up and the<br />\nscene ends with intensity.

The initial screen<br />\ndepicts a striking, rooftop view<br />\nof London, and the first scene<br />\ntakes us inside the cozy Darling<br />\nhome.<br />\nAt the end of this scene, the<br />\nroom falls away to reveal a dark<br />\nfog-swept London, over which<br />\nthe children fly amid glowing<br />\nstars. When the curtain rose on<br />\nNeverland, a misty, primordial<br />\nworld of technicolor, the audience burst into applause at the<br />\nsight of the set alone.

Dr. Dianne Tobin,<br />\nAssistant Director of the Division<br />\nof Education and Associate Professor of Education at the School<br />\nof Continuing Studies, is organizing a teaching certification program in response to the increasing number of students asking<br />\nDean Roseman as to how they<br />\ncan pursue a career in education<br />\nat Hopkins. An informational<br />\nmeeting for all those interested<br />\nwill be held this Tuesday,<br />\nNovember 13, from 4:00-6:00<br />\np.m., in Shaffer 3.<br />\nThis winter, a two week Intersession course dealing with<br />\nissues in education and career exploration in the teaching field will<br />\nbe offered. The class will deal<br />\nwith such issues as the underlying philosophy of U.S. schools<br />\nwhich distinguishes it from<br />\nschool systems in other countries,<br />\nnamely the belief that all students<br />\ncan learn. This creates a situation<br />\nin which the teacher tries to help<br />\nall the students grasp the material<br />\ninstead of setting up roadblocks<br />\nalong the way to winnow out the<br />\nless able students. In addition,<br />\npossibilities for expansion and advancement in the field of education will be discussed.<br />\nThe Masters of Arts and<br />\nTeaching requires a strong<br />\nbackground in the basic subjects<br />\ntaught in high school. Majors<br />\nsuch as Biology, English and<br />\nHistory are recommended instead<br />\nof more specialized subjects or<br />\ninterdisciplinary<br />\nmajors.<br />\nFreshmen and Sophomores<br />\nuncertain about their choice of<br />\nmajor are encouraged to talk to<br />\nDr. Tobin.<br /><br />\nUndergraduates would apply<br />\nfor the program at the end of their<br />\njunior year and then proceed to<br />\ntake courses from the School of<br />\nContinuing Studies over the summer before their senior year.<br />\nThese courses would include<br />\n\"Educational Psychology: Learning,\" \"Human Growth and<br />\nDevelopment,\" and \"Secondary<br />\nCurriculum,\" the last of which is<br />\nnine credits.<br />\nFollowing their senior year,<br />\nstudents would take \"Maintaining the Exceptional Child,\"<br />\n\"Methods of Teaching in Secondary School,\" and \"Tests and<br />\nMeasurements,\" the last one<br />\nagain being nine credits. Students<br />\nwould then be prepared to recieve<br />\na teaching certificattion with one<br />\nmore requirement of nine credits<br />\nof student teaching.<br />\nDr. Tobin is looking into an<br />\noption to allow graduates to begin<br />\nteaching right away, in the fall of<br />\ntheir first year out of Hopkins.<br />\nShe hopes to get the Baltimore city schools to allow students to<br />\nbegin working under a supervisor<br />\nand mentor. As of yet, though,<br />\na method of finding jobs for individuals in this program has not<br />\nbeen formalized.<br />\nThe overall objective of this<br />\nprogram is to get good liberal arts<br />\nstudents into teaching more<br />\nquickly than through the normal<br />\nroute. Typically, a student who<br />\ngraduates with a liberal arts<br />\ndegree would have to get a<br />\nMasters as well. Demand for<br />\nstudents with a solid background<br />\nin liberal arts instead of a<br />\nbachelor's degree in education is<br />\nhigh and educators are doing all<br />\nthey can to draw the best and<br />\nbrightest into teaching. Dr. Tobin<br />\npredicts most.of the interest will<br />\ncome from students in the math<br />\nand science departments instead<br />\nof those in the social sciences and<br />\nhumanities.<br />\nDr. Tobin sees two sweeping<br />\nforces in this country as pointing<br /><br />\ntoward a trend toward the<br />\nteaching profession. First, there<br />\nhas been a great deal of publicity<br />\nfor the notion that it should be<br />\nmade easier for the bright, liberal<br />\narts students to enter teaching.<br />\nDr. Tobin sees this as a response<br />\nto teacher shortages and a lack of<br />\nexpertise in those teachers currently available. Programs such<br />\nas Teach For America, which<br />\nholds a brief orientation program<br />\nfor students who have just<br />\ngraduated and sends them to teach<br />\nin areas where teacher shortages<br />\nare a major problem, respond and<br />\nencourage students to enter into<br />\nteaching.<br />\nThe second force leading to this<br /><br />\nnationwide trend is the shift of the<br />\nmentality away from that which<br />\nproduced the kinds of students<br />\nwho went into finance, investment, and law to one more interested in social problems and<br />\njob satisfaction. Dr. Tobin sees<br />\nthe 1990's as bringing a different<br />\ntype of student into the world,<br />\none interested in helping others,<br />\ninterested in a \"meaningful occupation.\" She sees social concern as replacing power and<br />\nwealth as motivating forces.<br />\nDr. Tobin cites several instances in which people in the<br />\nbusiness world making $80,000<br />\nand $90,000 a year come to her<br />\nwanting a Masters in Arts and<br /><br />\nTeaching. Reasons for this vary.<br />\nTobin points out that there is a<br />\nmore \"collegial atmospohere\"<br />\namong teachers instead of the<br />\nharsh competitiveness in other<br />\nfields. In addition, people are<br />\nlooking more to \"life satisfaction\" and time with their family<br />\nand friends outside of work. No<br />\nother profession allows for a three<br />\nmonth vacation every year. She<br />\ncites the -yearly renewal\" of<br />\nhaving a new class with a different character every year<br />\npreventing the stagnation of dealing with the same people every<br />\nday.<br />\nThese tremendous advantages<br />\nare just beginning to be noticed,<br /><br />\n1400<br />\nof<br /><br />\nToachers<br />\nThoustmds<br />\n1300<br /><br />\n1200<br /><br />\n100-0<br /><br />\n4<br />\n1980<br /><br />\n1 982<br /><br />\nby Jessica Maxwell<br />\nLocated inside the Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art, the Art Museum<br />\nCafe is a fairly easy walk from<br />\ncampus and most of Charles<br />\nVillage.

However, F&amp;M's<br />\nquarterback was intercepted three<br />\ntimes by the ball hawking Jays<br />\nlate in the game to preserve the<br />\nvictory.

You've<br />\nrescued me from another week<br />\nwithout a good injury, and inspired this new and innovative<br />\ninteractive format. The condition you've described is commonly<br />\ncalled \"saddle<br />\nsoreness,\" and is a common<br />\nailment among cyclists. It is<br />\nessentially a cramp of the<br />\nmuscles which are being pressed against the bicycle seat. So,<br />\ntell me something I don't<br />\nknow. The reason this condition is so common is that,<br />\nwhile you are sustaining muscle contraction in that area, the<br />\npressure that pesky seat is exerting is obstructing the blood<br />\nsupply to the area. Like shin<br />\nsplints, the condition is often<br />\ninevitable in early training<br />\n(especially with a seat that's<br />\nnot broken-in). Stretching<br />\nbefore riding can help alleviate<br />\nthe condition. The most<br />\nhelpful stretch is the low-back<br />\nstretch, in which you lie on<br />\nyour back, lift your knee to<br />\nyour chest, and hold it for 10<br />\nseconds. Repeat this procedure<br />\n10-20 times with each leg.<br />\nLow sodium and potassium<br />\nlevels also cause cramps, so<br />\neat your bananas. Readers, this<br />\nis only the beginning.

S.A.I.S. kept the<br />\nscore close in the first half by<br />\nutilizing their larger size and<br />\nheight, but Hopkins' speed, skill,<br />\nand superior conditioning<br />\nswamped the opponents in the second half.<br />\nS.A.I.S. managed to score<br />\nwithin the first minute of the<br />\ngame with a penalty kick from 30<br />\nmeters out. Sophomore flyhalf<br />\nMatt Shive tied the score at 3 all<br />\nwith a penalty kick of his own.<br />\nAfter a brief lapse in scoring,<br />\nS.A.I.S. again scored with a<br />\npenalty kick to lead, 6-0. With<br />\njust 10 minutes left in the half,<br />\nHopkins began its barrage of<br />\nscoring. On a designed play,<br />\njunior prop Scott Haag took a<br />\npenalty ball from about 15 meters<br />\nfrom the try line and did his best<br />\nimpression of a battering rain into<br /><br />\nthe heart of S.A.I.S.'s scrum. An<br />\n\"unseen force\" pushed the<br />\nball into the try zone for, the<br />\nscore. Haag revealed after the<br />\ngame that the ball had been stopped inches from the try line so he<br />\n\"got down and blew that sucker<br />\nright in and landed on it!\"<br />\nMembers of the team readily supported this statement by bringing<br />\nup Haag's less than quite speaking voice. Five minutes after the<br />\nfirst try, Hopkins scored again in<br />\nan electrifying fashion to stun the<br />\nS.A.I.S. team. It came off of a<br />\nhigh pop kick which a S.A.I.S.<br />\nplayer tried to field. Hopkins'<br />\ncoverage got to him at the same<br />\ntime as the ball and popped the<br />\nball right into the hands of<br />\nfreshman lock Bill Covig, who<br />\nlumbered 30 meters for the try.<br />\nThe points after both tries were<br />\nmissed, and the hald ended with<br />\nHopkins leading, 11-6.<br />\nThe second half was all<br />\nHopkins as they dominated every<br />\nfacet of the game. Freshmen<br />\nsubstitutes who had filled in continued ihe onslaught against a tir-<br /><br />\ning and demoralized S.A.I.S.<br />\nsquad. Five minutes into the half,<br />\njunior 8 man Julian Edwards took<br />\nthe ball off the scrum on a keeper<br />\nto score. This put him in the lead<br />\nwith 3 tries for the season and for<br />\nthe much coveted award that goes<br />\nto the team's leading scorer. The<br />\nnext score highlighted Hopkins'<br />\nball supporting abilities. The ball<br />\nwas passed down the back line to<br />\ncreate a 2 on 1 at the wind.<br />\nHopkins took advantage of this<br />\nand passed off to sophomore<br />\nwinger Josh Flowers, who blazed in for his second try of the<br />\nseason. By this time, S.A.I.S.<br />\nwas completely out of the game<br />\nand had generated no scoring<br />\nthreat. Luck, though, was also<br />\nwith the Hopkins team. A loose<br />\nball had rolled into the S.A.1.S.<br />\ntry zone, and three players dived for it. A S.A.I.S. player<br />\nmanaged to grab the ball thr what<br />\nwould be a touchback, but Cort<br />\nMcMeel and Scott Haag wrestled the ball away from him just as<br />\nthe referee came by. The try was<br />\nawarded to Hopkins and credited<br /><br />\nto Cort McMeel for his first try<br />\nof the season. After the game,<br />\nMcMeel stated, \"I want people<br />\nto know that I scored the dirtiest,<br />\ncheapest try in Hopkins rugby<br />\nhistory,\" to which a chorus of<br />\nwhy's were heard. The final<br />\nscore came off of an assist by<br />\nHopkins coach Frank Deerdon,<br />\nwho had come in as a prop in the<br />\nsecond half. The 50 plus<br />\ncoach/player showed flashes of<br />\nChristian Okoye in his running<br />\nstyle (although Okoye has most<br />\nof his muscle around his chest and<br />\nthighs, Deerdon has his around<br />\nthe girth). Deerdon managed to<br />\nbull his way to the 22 before<br />\ndishing off to Bill Covig, who<br />\nbroke tackles and pirouetted his<br />\nway forward until he discovered<br />\nthat he was in the try zone. All<br />\nfour points after were missed by<br />\nHopkins, so the final score stood<br />\nat 27-6.<br />\nHopkins will end its season<br />\nagainst a tough St. Mary's College team, which crushed them<br />\nlast season. on Saturday at<br />\n12:30 p.m. on the B1A field<br /><br />\nan injury.
