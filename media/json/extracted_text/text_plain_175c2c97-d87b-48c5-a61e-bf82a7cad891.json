JOHN'S PRESIDENT-ELECT<br />\nIf Professor R. V. D. Magoffin accepts the presidency of St. John's<br />\nCollege, the undergraduates of Johns Hopkins will lose one of their best<br />\nfriends. The genial instructor of archaeology is by far one of the most<br />\npopular members of the faculty.<br />\nThe seniors recently showed their appreciation of Dr. Magoffin's<br />\ninterest in student affairs by selecting him as the faculty member of<br />\nJune Week Committee. He is one of that rare variety of professors<br />\n\u2022 that is as broad of heart as of mind. It is a safe venture to say that<br />\nhe has a closer understanding of students than any of our faculty members. Most any day he may be found during lunch hour mingling with<br />\nthe \"young hope.\" The democratic smile and friendly chat will be<br />\nmissed.<br />\nDr. Magoffin could, probably, work wonders at St. John's; yet<br />\nwe can hardly help but hope that he will risk the chance of future advancement at Hopkins. Dr. Fell presided over the Annapolis institution for twenty-seven years, if press accounts may be trusted, yet the<br />\ncollege has received a lower rating in the past few years. And if memory serves, the first president of the University of Pennsylvania was<br />\ntaken from the president's chair at St. John's. If Dr. Magoffin will<br />\neventually attain the position that his personality deserves, we will, with<br />\nregret, be willing to part with him. But unless he will be allowed to<br />\nplace himself and his institution upon the plane where they belong, we<br />\nprefer that he will remain with us.<br />\nWe congratulate Dr. Magoffin on his election. We congratulate<br />\nSt. John's on her selection, and we further congratulate her if the<br />\nDoctor accepts.<br />\nHopkins' loss will be St. Johni's gain!<br />\n<br />\nThe \"PRACTICAL\" Alchemist and<br />\n\"THEORETICAL\" Robert Boyle<br />\nHE alchemists wrote<br />\nvaguely of \"fluids\" and<br />\n\"principles.\" Copper<br />\nwas potentially silver.<br />\nRid it of its red color and the<br />\n\"principle\" of silver would assert<br />\nitself, so that silver would remain.<br />\nWith a certain amount of philosopher's stone (itself a mysterious<br />\n\"principle\") a base metal could be<br />\nconverted into a quantity of gold<br />\na million times as great.<br />\nThis all sounded so \"practical\"<br />\nthat Kings listened credulously,<br />\nbut the only tangible result was<br />\nthat they were enriched with much<br />\nbogus gold.<br />\nScientific theorists like Robert<br />\nBoyle (I62.7-1691) proved more<br />\n\"practical\" by testing matter, discovering its composition and then<br />\ndrawing scientific conclusions that<br />\ncould thereafter be usefully and<br />\nhonestly applied.

JOHN'S PRESIDENT-ELECT<br />\nIf Professor R. V. D. Magoffin accepts the presidency of St. John's<br />\nCollege, the undergraduates of Johns Hopkins will lose one of their best<br />\nfriends. The genial instructor of archaeology is by far one of the most<br />\npopular members of the faculty.<br />\nThe seniors recently showed their appreciation of Dr. Magoffin's<br />\ninterest in student affairs by selecting him as the faculty member of<br />\nJune Week Committee. He is one of that rare variety of professors<br />\n\u2022 that is as broad of heart as of mind. It is a safe venture to say that<br />\nhe has a closer understanding of students than any of our faculty members. Most any day he may be found during lunch hour mingling with<br />\nthe \"young hope.\" The democratic smile and friendly chat will be<br />\nmissed.<br />\nDr. Magoffin could, probably, work wonders at St. John's; yet<br />\nwe can hardly help but hope that he will risk the chance of future advancement at Hopkins. Dr. Fell presided over the Annapolis institution for twenty-seven years, if press accounts may be trusted, yet the<br />\ncollege has received a lower rating in the past few years. And if memory serves, the first president of the University of Pennsylvania was<br />\ntaken from the president's chair at St. John's. If Dr. Magoffin will<br />\neventually attain the position that his personality deserves, we will, with<br />\nregret, be willing to part with him. But unless he will be allowed to<br />\nplace himself and his institution upon the plane where they belong, we<br />\nprefer that he will remain with us.<br />\nWe congratulate Dr. Magoffin on his election. We congratulate<br />\nSt. John's on her selection, and we further congratulate her if the<br />\nDoctor accepts.<br />\nHopkins' loss will be St. Johni's gain!<br /><br />\nThe \"PRACTICAL\" Alchemist and<br />\n\"THEORETICAL\" Robert Boyle<br />\nHE alchemists wrote<br />\nvaguely of \"fluids\" and<br />\n\"principles.\" Copper<br />\nwas potentially silver.<br />\nRid it of its red color and the<br />\n\"principle\" of silver would assert<br />\nitself, so that silver would remain.<br />\nWith a certain amount of philosopher's stone (itself a mysterious<br />\n\"principle\") a base metal could be<br />\nconverted into a quantity of gold<br />\na million times as great.<br />\nThis all sounded so \"practical\"<br />\nthat Kings listened credulously,<br />\nbut the only tangible result was<br />\nthat they were enriched with much<br />\nbogus gold.<br />\nScientific theorists like Robert<br />\nBoyle (I62.7-1691) proved more<br />\n\"practical\" by testing matter, discovering its composition and then<br />\ndrawing scientific conclusions that<br />\ncould thereafter be usefully and<br />\nhonestly applied.
