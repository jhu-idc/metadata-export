This was<br />\nthe viewpoint expressed by Dean<br />\nRudoy at the previous meeting.<br />\nPostponement of the decision<br />\nwill give the Council a better indication of students' views on the<br />\nwar.

He<br />\nemphasized the fact that any Senator who did misuse funds was<br />\ndriven to that remedy by the high<br />\ncost of holding political office. \u2022<br />\nThe first financial hurdle which<br />\na candidate must face is the cost of<br />\nrunning for office. The Congress<br />\nhas placed a limit on candidate expenditures. According to this measure, a candidate for the House<br />\n<br />\nmay spend only $5,000, a Senatorial candidate, $25,000 and a presidential candidate, $3 million.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Douglas, actual<br />\ncosts may run to more than forty<br />\ntimes these estimates.<br />\nNever Heard Of It<br />\nThis forces the candidate to<br />\nform separate \"citizens' committees\" and to obscure his expenditures by channelling money<br />\nthrough these groups. Then, the<br />\ncandidate must disavow any knowledge of the existence of these<br />\ncommittees. Douglas added, \"The<br />\nresults are therefore demeaning as<br />\nwell as ineffective. And yet almost<br />\nno practicing politician dares to<br />\nconfess the truth.\"<br />\nSeven G's<br />\nThe high cost of running for<br />\noffice discourages many men from<br />\nlower and middle income groups.<br />\nThe former Senator believes that<br />\na new and democratic way of financing campaigns must be instituted. \"Otherwise we will close<br />\noff public life to people and interests who need to feel that they<br />\nare a part of society and can make<br />\ncontributions to it.\"<br />\nThe second great problem<br />\n<br />\nwhich tends to challenge the ethics<br />\nof our national legislators is that<br />\nof financing their stay in office.<br />\nOut of his salary as a Senator, of<br />\n$30,000, Douglas was left with<br />\nless than $7,000 after taxes and<br />\nexpenses. This small sum had to<br />\n<br />\ncover all of his and his family's<br />\nliving costs. Douglas cautioned<br />\nabout being too harsh on Thomas<br />\nDodd, of Connecticut. Dodd had<br />\nto put six children through college<br />\non roughly the same budget.<br />\nAn increase in legislators' salaries is, however, not the answer.<br />\nDouglas believes that this would<br />\nonly tend to up the cost of a stay<br />\nin office. He favors the solution<br />\nproposed by Senators Lee Metcalf<br />\nand Albert Gore. This proposal<br />\ncalls for certificates of one dollar<br />\nto be distributed to every registered voter. The voter could then<br />\ngive this certificate to the candidate, party, or political organization of his choice.<br />\nIn this way, the high cost of<br />\ncampaigning could be funded by<br />\nthe federal government. But the<br />\nindividual voter would also be able<br />\nto make a significant contribution<br />\nto the candidate he favors.<br />\nThis plan would undoubtedly<br />\ndecrease graft among federal legislators. Most of the fraud committed is done in the interest of paying campaign debts. Under the<br />\n<br />\nThe Honorable Paul H.

John Makransky, Josh Treem<br />\nNEWS:<br />\n<br />\nJohnsonian Democracy<br />\nIf anything conclusive has resulted from the Senate Foreign Relations hearings last Monday and Tuesday, it is that all the potshots by<br />\nsenators, congressmen and other \"official\" representatives will not<br />\nsway the present Administration from its murderous course in Viet<br />\nNam. Lyndon.Johnson will not be shaken even if Senator McCarthy<br />\nruns up a string of primary victories, which is, in itself, doubtful. The<br />\nlast three administrations covering the past fourteen years have made<br />\ncovert and overt commitments to the tragedy which has manifested itself in Vietnam.The only attitude which has changed under the leadership of the past three presidents is an increase in the degree of executive arrogance.<br />\nAs early as 1954, The United States under Eisenhower was paying<br />\n75% of France's cost in running the Indochinese war,(some of the<br />\nfunds being siphoned off from the supposedly altruistic Marshall<br />\nPlaa). Kennedy formalized the American commitment in the 60's,<br />\nand Johnson has made our present course irrevocable. There should<br />\nbe no misunderstanding - - this country's leadership has never doubted that the United States would intervene in Vietnam. Our presence<br />\nthere was a planned and conscious move. The history of this involvement has also been a history of circumventing or ignoring protest.<br />\nIn the fifties, the American people were,for the most part, unaware<br />\nof our building commitment in Asia. Now, in the sixties, Lyndon<br />\nJohnson uses the best of two methods: he denies rumors of any stepups in the war, only to escalate months later, or he arrogantly acts<br />\ndespite outcries from \"responsible\" leaders.<br />\n\"I do not excuse myself,\" said Senator Albert Gore at the hearings<br />\nTuesday. \"We all should have raised questions earlier.\" This is a sad<br />\nand costly admission - - the original sin of most of our legislators<br />\nHowever, perhaps Senator Gore is absolved by the fact that presidents like Lyndon Johnson have demonstrated that such questions<br />\nwould not have made a difference in policy-making.\"As sure as I'm<br />\nsitting here,\" stated Senator Frank Church,\"by fall, we'll have more<br />\nAmerican soldiers in Vietnam that those of the Vietnamese.\" No<br />\ndenial by Rusk. The policy of the Johnson administration has taken<br />\non the air of inevitability. When questioned by senators opposing the<br />\nwar,Rusk always replied with the classic \"Well, we are going to .<br />\nThis is the \"we\" of the Administration and it does not include the<br />\nelected representatives in the Senate and the House. Rusk's \"we\"<br />\ntells us that the McCarthys,Kennedys, Churchs and Morses are irrelevant. In effect, we are irrelevant. The administration has closed the<br />\ndoor on alternatives proposed by other parties. The only role of the<br />\nAmerican citizen in the Johnsonian scheme is to pay for the war in<br />\nblood and in money.<br />\nNor is Johnson, as the popular mythology goes, any more receptive to leaders concerned with domestic problems. That Johnson and<br />\nhis Administration ignores notable educators, civil rights leaders,<br />\neconomists and social reformers. Meantime, the news media decries<br />\nthe growing alienation from the traditional political structure.<br />\nMost political observers have recently expressed hope in the McCarthy movement because it is encouraging dissenters to work<br />\nthrough the established order. Unhappily, this is wishful thinking, it<br />\nis an illusion. The answer - - the action which will make a dent in<br />\nJohnson's arrogance (taking into account the likely assumption that<br />\nhe will be re-elected) - - is widespread resistance, particularly in regard to the War. Alternatives to Johnson lie in draft resistance,<br />\nrefusal to pay war-connected taxes such as the federal levy on telephone bills, and in mass protests such as Martin Luther King's upcoming March on Washington. The system which Johnson represents<br />\nmust be challenged since no other candidate or official on the political scene presently offers a viable alternative. This is not a new philosophy. It harks back to Thoreau and Rousseau who knew that citizens have the right to use extra-legal means when a government ceases to be responsive. Since Johnson is putting an end to dissent as the<br />\ncherished American tradition, we see no other way.<br />\n<br />\nHe Don't Know Us Very Well<br />\n\"In America conscription is unknown and men are induced to enlist by bounties. The notion and habits of the people of the United<br />\nState are so opposed to compulsory recruiting that I do not think it<br />\ncan ever be sanctioned by the laws.\"<br />\nAlexis de Tocqueville,<br />\nDEMOCRACY IN AMERICA 1835<br />\n<br />\nThe Michael Hirsh Story<br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\n(Three midgets in one overcoat.<br />\nThe top midget smokes a cigar<br />\nwhich we soon come to realize is a<br />\nfourth midget.

The sound of weeping is<br />\nheard from a hospital corridor in<br />\neveryone's memory ...) MICHAEL<br />\nHIRSH is on his way! Hot on the<br />\nheels of three weeks of movieland<br />\nmurders here at Hopkins (the reference being to Stan Brakhage<br />\nand the Maryland Film Festival)<br />\nwe are to witness the touching of<br />\npalm to mouth of perhaps the best<br />\n(and certainly my favorite) underground moviemaker in the business - this Hirsh. He will show is<br />\nmost recent Love Movies in Shaffer<br />\nHall at 8:30 p.m. Saturday (tomorrow) night. He will also give a<br />\nbit of a Lecture-and-Hello with<br />\ntape loops and his Memory Movie<br />\nLoops.<br />\nHirsh, who now works out of<br />\nToronto for reasons of health, was<br />\nborn in Belgium during the War.<br />\nFrom Belgium he and his family<br />\nmade a beeline to New York City,<br />\nwhere Hirsh was raised and where<br />\nhe began, in Zoos and Botanical<br />\nGardens, to make films. Right<br />\nfrom the first - - a little number<br />\ncalled ABES AND IZZY - - the<br />\ncrowd went crazy with joy. ABES<br />\nAND IZZY was a retelling of the<br />\nAbraham and Isaac story with<br />\nKierkegaardian soundtrack and the<br />\nAngel of the Lord on a motor<br />\nscooter. It was shown in New York<br />\nat a gala opening to which very<br />\nfew people came. Nevertheless,<br />\nJonas Mekas, the father of underground cinema (as they say in the<br />\nparlance of the vulgar) said: \"I<br />\nthink it is fine.\"<br />\nThis encouraged Hirsh to keep<br />\nat it and he subsequently turned<br />\nout THE GREEKS HAD A WORD<br />\nFOR IT (which is the best movie<br />\nI ever saw.

The format follows<br />\nsomewhat loosely that of the old<br />\nSoupy Sales show!)<br />\nLast year Hirsh was busted for<br />\nobscenity in Toronto. He was subsequently invited on to a Canadian<br />\nBroadcasting Company interview<br />\nshow (the CBC desiring to cash in<br />\non the fortuitous notoriety) where<br />\nhe said his work in films was a reaction against \"the massive series<br />\nof mindless jaded films that represent our cinematic heritage.\" He<br />\nbeat the obscenity rap and now<br />\nthe National Film Board of Canada plans to finance an $80,000<br />\n<br />\nbeer<br />\nwhic<br />\nlecti\u00b0<br />\nictio nrir!<br />\nNov<br />\nzine<br />\ncleat110(<br />\ncon,<br />\nsel<br />\n<br />\n16-mm film he is to shoot this<br />\nsummer . . .

We stated at the time of our<br />\ninterview that there was nothing<br />\nin the present state of the Cornmit tee meriting news coverage. Accordingly we were told that no artide would be published and accordingly we took no great nains<br />\nto explain to your reporter all that<br />\napparently needed explanation. It<br />\nwould take too long to correct<br />\neverything misrepresented, but we<br />\nbeg to be allowed to make these<br />\nfew points.<br />\nThe Committee has not been in<br />\ndecline since late last year when<br />\nstructural alterations were made in<br />\nour organifation. Startling progress has not been made admittedly. but it has taken time for the<br />\n<br />\nnew leadership to accustom itself<br />\nto the situation and there is hope<br />\nstill for the future. The active<br />\nmembership of twenty-seven disparaged in the article is in fact an<br />\nimprovement over the only sporadically effective and never de'<br />\nfined membership of last December, particularly when it is realized<br />\nthat it consists very largely or per<br />\nsonal acquaintances of the Secretary. We look forward to really<br />\nconsiderable expansion once the<br />\nresults of our circular have been<br />\nassessed.<br />\nThe 'old' committee had no<br />\nformal leadership.

He collects on<br />\nthese favors as Rockefeller's supPort waxes and wanes according<br />\nto prevalent rumors concerning his<br />\nf candidacy. At last, Mr. Rockefeller<br />\nannounces his candidacy sometiMe in April. By then, Nixon is<br />\nWell on his way to amassing the<br />\nnecessary delegate support. His<br />\nlast crucial test comes in the California primary which Nixon, with<br />\nthe backing of Reagan (who is<br />\ngenerally predicted to be Nixon's<br />\n'running mate) wins handily.<br />\nMeanwhile, McCartry has continued to do well, always coming<br />\nnear a majority, and possibly wint in either Wisconsin or Oregon.<br />\n,ning<br />\nIle already has the first ballot<br />\nPledge of the Massachusetts delegation.

Mr. Johnson is nominated<br />\non the first ballot and, as a show<br />\nof confidence, retains Hubert<br />\nHumphrey as Vice-President.<br />\nPeace planks are voted down, as<br />\nthe Democratic platform emerges<br />\nas an endorsement of President<br />\nJohnson's current policies. Robert<br />\nKennedy calls (perhaps in his late<br />\nbrother's name) for party unity<br />\n(Bobby wanting a strong party for<br />\nthe 1972 campaign). Kennedy's<br />\ncall of unification leaves the peace<br />\nwing defenseless. McCarthy is later<br />\nstripped of party seniority as a<br />\npenalty for challenging the incumbent President.

The Republican position undercut, the<br />\nPresident gains some lost support.<br />\nIn late summer, Governor Wallace announces his withdrawal<br />\nfrom the race. It is rumored that<br />\nWallace has made a deal with Nixon to give Nixon his Southern<br />\nsupport if the Republican promises to veto civil rights legislation<br />\nwhen elected. Nixon's vehement<br />\ndenials of these rumors scare Wallace, who now officially announces that such a deal was made, and<br />\nthreatens to re-enter the race unless Nixon acknowledges it.

At this point<br />\nmany moderate and all liberal Republicans desert his ticket.<br />\nWith the World Series over,<br />\nboth candidates begin to seriously<br />\ncampaign. Johnson works hard in<br />\nthe South where he tries to revive<br />\nthe traditional Democratic machinery and in the North where he<br />\ntries to activate lethargic and discouraged liberal Democrats. In the<br />\nSouth, Johnson assumes an ever<br />\nincreasing hawkishness, while in<br />\nthe North he talks about economic<br />\nreforms, although keeping away as<br />\nmuch as possible from civil rights<br />\nissues.<br />\nNixon campaigns energetically<br />\nthrough the South, and in the traditional Republican areas of the<br />\nmidwest while Reagan works the<br />\nWest Coast and the urban centers.<br />\nThe Nixon-Reagan ticket advo-<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENTIAL candidate Wallace announced plans for the Lincoln Penny.<br />\ncates a stronger line in Vietnam,<br />\n\"a beef-up of the forces of law and<br />\norder\" and \"a return to the traditional American morality.\" In this<br />\nvein, Reagan suggests widespread<br />\nre-institution of the death penalty<br />\nas well as suppression of dissenting<br />\nwar views.<br />\nAt the beginning of the campaign, there is some talk of television debates, but this soon dies<br />\nout when it becomes apparent that<br />\nneither campaign manager believes<br />\nhis man can profit from a live television appearance. The idea of a<br />\ndebate between the Vice-Presidential candidates takes hold, however, Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Reagan are both found anxious to go<br />\nat it, a fascinating encounter ensues and a good time is had by all.<br />\nIn early October a new N.L.F.<br />\noffensive is opened in Vietnam.<br />\nThe 700,000 American troops stationed there as well as the South<br />\nVietnamese army are forced to fall<br />\nback.

All the Communist<br />\nnations and \"third world powers\"<br />\nfire off bitter denunciations.

The closing weeks of the<br />\ncampaign find Nixon and Reagan<br />\nreeling from Johnson's blows. Nixon, as he did in 1960, has committed himself to campaign in all fifty<br />\nstates and thus wastes valuable last<br />\nminute time with Alaska and Hawaii.

I<br />\nstrongly question this group's<br />\nright to imply to the world the<br />\nfeelings of the Hopkins community<br />\nby taking its own stand on the<br />\nquestion of Vietnam. It was my<br />\nfear that the council was not fulfilling its obligation to the students<br />\nthat prompted my \"walkout.\"<br />\nAt the March fourth Student<br />\nCouncil meeting,the Council handily defeated (10-5) my motion to<br />\ndefer the policy statement on the<br />\nwar until after the national college<br />\n<br />\npresidential preference primary,<br />\nChoice '68. It then proceeded to<br />\ninitiate the mechanism that would<br />\nresult in the issuance of the Council's opinion, not the students', on<br />\nVietnam. At this point, the Council lost its quorum, and action was<br />\ndeferred to this past Monday evening. At this time, a suggestion (the<br />\nsame one that I had proposed the<br />\nweek before) to delay further action on the war until after the<br />\nChoice '68 results could be tabulated was moved. After no debate,<br />\nthis was adopted by a vote of<br />\n21-1-1. The sudden change of heart<br />\nby the Council showed that drastic<br />\nor even dramatic action is sometimes needed to stimulate it to fulfill its obligations. No doubt a<br />\nstatement on the war will come<br />\nout by May of this year, but it will<br />\nbe a statement that represents the<br />\nstudents' as well as the Council's<br />\n<br />\nfeelings.<br />\nNow it seems that my action<br />\nwas not a \"flagrantly irresponsible\" one, but rather one which<br />\nwill help to maintain and uphold<br />\nthe Student Council's obligation<br />\n- - to present opinions not of itself, but the students.<br />\nKen Borow<br />\nS.C.

If an audience could be<br />\nfound I am sure that the faculty<br />\nwould be willing virtually to satiate it. We are trying to find such<br />\nan audience.<br />\nFinally there is the question of<br />\na merger with SFM or CSA. Although the leadership and vast<br />\n<br />\nbulk of the membership of the<br />\nCommittee support the efforts<br />\nof Senator Eugene McCarthy an<br />\norganization of our kind cannot<br />\nally itself exclusively with partisan candidates for political office.<br />\nIn that respect JHV-NC is narrower in scope than SFM.

He<br />\nemphasized the fact that any Senator who did misuse funds was<br />\ndriven to that remedy by the high<br />\ncost of holding political office. \u2022<br />\nThe first financial hurdle which<br />\na candidate must face is the cost of<br />\nrunning for office. The Congress<br />\nhas placed a limit on candidate expenditures. According to this measure, a candidate for the House<br /><br />\nmay spend only $5,000, a Senatorial candidate, $25,000 and a presidential candidate, $3 million.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Douglas, actual<br />\ncosts may run to more than forty<br />\ntimes these estimates.<br />\nNever Heard Of It<br />\nThis forces the candidate to<br />\nform separate \"citizens' committees\" and to obscure his expenditures by channelling money<br />\nthrough these groups. Then, the<br />\ncandidate must disavow any knowledge of the existence of these<br />\ncommittees. Douglas added, \"The<br />\nresults are therefore demeaning as<br />\nwell as ineffective. And yet almost<br />\nno practicing politician dares to<br />\nconfess the truth.\"<br />\nSeven G's<br />\nThe high cost of running for<br />\noffice discourages many men from<br />\nlower and middle income groups.<br />\nThe former Senator believes that<br />\na new and democratic way of financing campaigns must be instituted. \"Otherwise we will close<br />\noff public life to people and interests who need to feel that they<br />\nare a part of society and can make<br />\ncontributions to it.\"<br />\nThe second great problem<br /><br />\nwhich tends to challenge the ethics<br />\nof our national legislators is that<br />\nof financing their stay in office.<br />\nOut of his salary as a Senator, of<br />\n$30,000, Douglas was left with<br />\nless than $7,000 after taxes and<br />\nexpenses. This small sum had to<br /><br />\ncover all of his and his family's<br />\nliving costs. Douglas cautioned<br />\nabout being too harsh on Thomas<br />\nDodd, of Connecticut. Dodd had<br />\nto put six children through college<br />\non roughly the same budget.<br />\nAn increase in legislators' salaries is, however, not the answer.<br />\nDouglas believes that this would<br />\nonly tend to up the cost of a stay<br />\nin office. He favors the solution<br />\nproposed by Senators Lee Metcalf<br />\nand Albert Gore. This proposal<br />\ncalls for certificates of one dollar<br />\nto be distributed to every registered voter. The voter could then<br />\ngive this certificate to the candidate, party, or political organization of his choice.<br />\nIn this way, the high cost of<br />\ncampaigning could be funded by<br />\nthe federal government. But the<br />\nindividual voter would also be able<br />\nto make a significant contribution<br />\nto the candidate he favors.<br />\nThis plan would undoubtedly<br />\ndecrease graft among federal legislators. Most of the fraud committed is done in the interest of paying campaign debts. Under the<br /><br />\nThe Honorable Paul H.

John Makransky, Josh Treem<br />\nNEWS:<br /><br />\nJohnsonian Democracy<br />\nIf anything conclusive has resulted from the Senate Foreign Relations hearings last Monday and Tuesday, it is that all the potshots by<br />\nsenators, congressmen and other \"official\" representatives will not<br />\nsway the present Administration from its murderous course in Viet<br />\nNam. Lyndon.Johnson will not be shaken even if Senator McCarthy<br />\nruns up a string of primary victories, which is, in itself, doubtful. The<br />\nlast three administrations covering the past fourteen years have made<br />\ncovert and overt commitments to the tragedy which has manifested itself in Vietnam.The only attitude which has changed under the leadership of the past three presidents is an increase in the degree of executive arrogance.<br />\nAs early as 1954, The United States under Eisenhower was paying<br />\n75% of France's cost in running the Indochinese war,(some of the<br />\nfunds being siphoned off from the supposedly altruistic Marshall<br />\nPlaa). Kennedy formalized the American commitment in the 60's,<br />\nand Johnson has made our present course irrevocable. There should<br />\nbe no misunderstanding - - this country's leadership has never doubted that the United States would intervene in Vietnam. Our presence<br />\nthere was a planned and conscious move. The history of this involvement has also been a history of circumventing or ignoring protest.<br />\nIn the fifties, the American people were,for the most part, unaware<br />\nof our building commitment in Asia. Now, in the sixties, Lyndon<br />\nJohnson uses the best of two methods: he denies rumors of any stepups in the war, only to escalate months later, or he arrogantly acts<br />\ndespite outcries from \"responsible\" leaders.<br />\n\"I do not excuse myself,\" said Senator Albert Gore at the hearings<br />\nTuesday. \"We all should have raised questions earlier.\" This is a sad<br />\nand costly admission - - the original sin of most of our legislators<br />\nHowever, perhaps Senator Gore is absolved by the fact that presidents like Lyndon Johnson have demonstrated that such questions<br />\nwould not have made a difference in policy-making.\"As sure as I'm<br />\nsitting here,\" stated Senator Frank Church,\"by fall, we'll have more<br />\nAmerican soldiers in Vietnam that those of the Vietnamese.\" No<br />\ndenial by Rusk. The policy of the Johnson administration has taken<br />\non the air of inevitability. When questioned by senators opposing the<br />\nwar,Rusk always replied with the classic \"Well, we are going to .<br />\nThis is the \"we\" of the Administration and it does not include the<br />\nelected representatives in the Senate and the House. Rusk's \"we\"<br />\ntells us that the McCarthys,Kennedys, Churchs and Morses are irrelevant. In effect, we are irrelevant. The administration has closed the<br />\ndoor on alternatives proposed by other parties. The only role of the<br />\nAmerican citizen in the Johnsonian scheme is to pay for the war in<br />\nblood and in money.<br />\nNor is Johnson, as the popular mythology goes, any more receptive to leaders concerned with domestic problems. That Johnson and<br />\nhis Administration ignores notable educators, civil rights leaders,<br />\neconomists and social reformers. Meantime, the news media decries<br />\nthe growing alienation from the traditional political structure.<br />\nMost political observers have recently expressed hope in the McCarthy movement because it is encouraging dissenters to work<br />\nthrough the established order. Unhappily, this is wishful thinking, it<br />\nis an illusion. The answer - - the action which will make a dent in<br />\nJohnson's arrogance (taking into account the likely assumption that<br />\nhe will be re-elected) - - is widespread resistance, particularly in regard to the War. Alternatives to Johnson lie in draft resistance,<br />\nrefusal to pay war-connected taxes such as the federal levy on telephone bills, and in mass protests such as Martin Luther King's upcoming March on Washington. The system which Johnson represents<br />\nmust be challenged since no other candidate or official on the political scene presently offers a viable alternative. This is not a new philosophy. It harks back to Thoreau and Rousseau who knew that citizens have the right to use extra-legal means when a government ceases to be responsive. Since Johnson is putting an end to dissent as the<br />\ncherished American tradition, we see no other way.<br /><br />\nHe Don't Know Us Very Well<br />\n\"In America conscription is unknown and men are induced to enlist by bounties. The notion and habits of the people of the United<br />\nState are so opposed to compulsory recruiting that I do not think it<br />\ncan ever be sanctioned by the laws.\"<br />\nAlexis de Tocqueville,<br />\nDEMOCRACY IN AMERICA 1835<br /><br />\nThe Michael Hirsh Story<br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\n(Three midgets in one overcoat.<br />\nThe top midget smokes a cigar<br />\nwhich we soon come to realize is a<br />\nfourth midget.

Hot on the<br />\nheels of three weeks of movieland<br />\nmurders here at Hopkins (the reference being to Stan Brakhage<br />\nand the Maryland Film Festival)<br />\nwe are to witness the touching of<br />\npalm to mouth of perhaps the best<br />\n(and certainly my favorite) underground moviemaker in the business - this Hirsh.

He will also give a<br />\nbit of a Lecture-and-Hello with<br />\ntape loops and his Memory Movie<br />\nLoops.<br />\nHirsh, who now works out of<br />\nToronto for reasons of health, was<br />\nborn in Belgium during the War.<br />\nFrom Belgium he and his family<br />\nmade a beeline to New York City,<br />\nwhere Hirsh was raised and where<br />\nhe began, in Zoos and Botanical<br />\nGardens, to make films. Right<br />\nfrom the first - - a little number<br />\ncalled ABES AND IZZY - - the<br />\ncrowd went crazy with joy. ABES<br />\nAND IZZY was a retelling of the<br />\nAbraham and Isaac story with<br />\nKierkegaardian soundtrack and the<br />\nAngel of the Lord on a motor<br />\nscooter. It was shown in New York<br />\nat a gala opening to which very<br />\nfew people came. Nevertheless,<br />\nJonas Mekas, the father of underground cinema (as they say in the<br />\nparlance of the vulgar) said: \"I<br />\nthink it is fine.\"<br />\nThis encouraged Hirsh to keep<br />\nat it and he subsequently turned<br />\nout THE GREEKS HAD A WORD<br />\nFOR IT (which is the best movie<br />\nI ever saw.

He was subsequently invited on to a Canadian<br />\nBroadcasting Company interview<br />\nshow (the CBC desiring to cash in<br />\non the fortuitous notoriety) where<br />\nhe said his work in films was a reaction against \"the massive series<br />\nof mindless jaded films that represent our cinematic heritage.\" He<br />\nbeat the obscenity rap and now<br />\nthe National Film Board of Canada plans to finance an $80,000<br /><br />\nbeer<br />\nwhic<br />\nlecti\u00b0<br />\nictio nrir!<br />\nNov<br />\nzine<br />\ncleat110(<br />\ncon,<br />\nsel<br /><br />\n16-mm film he is to shoot this<br />\nsummer . . .

We stated at the time of our<br />\ninterview that there was nothing<br />\nin the present state of the Cornmit tee meriting news coverage. Accordingly we were told that no artide would be published and accordingly we took no great nains<br />\nto explain to your reporter all that<br />\napparently needed explanation. It<br />\nwould take too long to correct<br />\neverything misrepresented, but we<br />\nbeg to be allowed to make these<br />\nfew points.<br />\nThe Committee has not been in<br />\ndecline since late last year when<br />\nstructural alterations were made in<br />\nour organifation. Startling progress has not been made admittedly. but it has taken time for the<br /><br />\nnew leadership to accustom itself<br />\nto the situation and there is hope<br />\nstill for the future. The active<br />\nmembership of twenty-seven disparaged in the article is in fact an<br />\nimprovement over the only sporadically effective and never de'<br />\nfined membership of last December, particularly when it is realized<br />\nthat it consists very largely or per<br />\nsonal acquaintances of the Secretary.

The pieces that have<br />\nbeen most offensive are those<br />\nWhich offer wierd and twisted prefictions as to what will happen in<br />\nNovember. A Sunday Times maga2ine article envisions an electoral<br />\ndeadlock settled in Congress. A<br />\ncondensation of a book by Rusthis sell Baker in the Saturday Evenears ing Post forsees a similar deadlock<br />\n.en. leading to the enthroning of Bobby<br />\n,n a Kennedy as Acting President<br />\nMiy amid a cordon of machine gun<br />\ntcd Wielding guards. This is sheer nonrsh sense. It is a diversion from the ob'he vious fact, a fact which we may be<br />\n.nd forgiven for wanting to delude<br />\nourselves about, but a fact that<br />\ngg-,<br />\nin will nevertheless come to pass.<br />\n:cs that fact is the tragic but inevitable re-election of Lyndon Johnson<br />\nas<br />\nre O President of the United States<br />\nn November 5, 1968. '<br />\nAs this article is being written,<br />\nthe people of New Hampshire are<br />\ngiving a significant majority to<br />\nRichard Nixon in that state's RePublican primary. A last minute<br />\npsuedo \"write-in-Rockefeller\"<br />\nmovement has failed miserably.<br />\nSeveral other Republican names<br />\nhave collected smatterings of supPort, but none challenge Mr. Nixon's clear cut victory.<br />\nIn the New Hampshire Democratic primary Senator Eugene<br />\nMcCarthy has been able to pick up<br />\nan . .unexpectedly high 42%<br />\nof the vote. Political analysts exPress surprise at McCarthy's success; the Senator's supporters take<br />\nheart. Lyndon Johnson is not<br />\nWorried.<br />\nAs spring works its way toward<br />\nsummer and the primaries continIle, Nixon picks up more and more<br />\ndelegate support. It must be re;- Membered that Mr. Nixon has<br />\ni Worked hard for the party for the<br />\nPast eight years and has a lot of<br />\nfavors due him. He collects on<br />\nthese favors as Rockefeller's supPort waxes and wanes according<br />\nto prevalent rumors concerning his<br />\nf candidacy. At last, Mr. Rockefeller<br />\nannounces his candidacy sometiMe in April. By then, Nixon is<br />\nWell on his way to amassing the<br />\nnecessary delegate support. His<br />\nlast crucial test comes in the California primary which Nixon, with<br />\nthe backing of Reagan (who is<br />\ngenerally predicted to be Nixon's<br />\n'running mate) wins handily.<br />\nMeanwhile, McCartry has continued to do well, always coming<br />\nnear a majority, and possibly wint in either Wisconsin or Oregon.<br />\n,ning<br />\nIle already has the first ballot<br />\nPledge of the Massachusetts delegation. There is much speculation<br />\nas to whether. Johnson can be renominated despite the rift in party.<br />\n1\u00b0Yalty. There is talk of a wide43Pen Democratic convention.

This results in a<br />\ntightening oC the U.S. \u2014 Canadian<br />\nborder. A young man is shot trying<br />\nto escape America, but the news is<br />\nsurpressed.<br />\nBetween the California primary<br />\nand the Democratic convention<br />\nreason returns to political analysis.<br />\nIt is remembered that the President of the United States holds an<br />\nunchallengable position in his own<br />\nparty. Mr. Johnson is nominated<br />\non the first ballot and, as a show<br />\nof confidence, retains Hubert<br />\nHumphrey as Vice-President.<br />\nPeace planks are voted down, as<br />\nthe Democratic platform emerges<br />\nas an endorsement of President<br />\nJohnson's current policies. Robert<br />\nKennedy calls (perhaps in his late<br />\nbrother's name) for party unity<br />\n(Bobby wanting a strong party for<br />\nthe 1972 campaign). Kennedy's<br />\ncall of unification leaves the peace<br />\nwing defenseless. McCarthy is later<br />\nstripped of party seniority as a<br />\npenalty for challenging the incumbent President. Many words are<br />\nwritten to the effect that heroes<br />\nare short sighted, short lived people but heroes nevertheless.<br />\nThe Republican convention is a<br />\nrepeat performance of 1964.<br />\nNixon is nominated on the first or<br />\nsecond ballot. despite a last ditch<br />\neffort by a Lindsay-Percy team<br />\n(who have taken over far, far too<br />\nlate from the floundering Rockefeller organization). As expected,<br />\nNixon picks Reagan for a running<br />\nmate. The California governor<br />\ncalls for party unity and receives a<br />\nsomewhat favorable response when<br />\nfewer than expected Republicans<br />\ndisavow themselves from the Nixon ticket.<br />\nJuly has brought with it the<br />\nnow traditional urban riots, this<br />\nyear's being worse than ever. Reagan proposes the declaration of<br />\nmartial law in ghetto areas for an<br />\nindefinite period. The President is<br />\nsurprised when this suggestion receives widespread public support.<br />\nAs a consequence, federal forces<br />\narc used more liberally in putting<br />\ndown the ghetto insurrections. For<br />\nthe first time in American history,<br />\na crowd is machine-gunned.<br />\nBoth Nixon and Reagan advocate the use of tactical nuclear<br />\nweapons in Vietnam.

The<br />\nPresident notes, however, that<br />\nmid-summer polls reveal 70% of<br />\nthe American people in favor of<br />\nsome sort of escalation of the war.<br />\nAs a consequence,later in the campaign Secretary of Defense Clark<br />\nClifford lets word drop that field<br />\ncommanders in Vietnam have and<br />\nhave had for some time,access tc<br />\ntactical nuclear weapons. The Republican position undercut, the<br />\nPresident gains some lost support.<br />\nIn late summer, Governor Wallace announces his withdrawal<br />\nfrom the race. It is rumored that<br />\nWallace has made a deal with Nixon to give Nixon his Southern<br />\nsupport if the Republican promises to veto civil rights legislation<br />\nwhen elected. Nixon's vehement<br />\ndenials of these rumors scare Wallace, who now officially announces that such a deal was made, and<br />\nthreatens to re-enter the race unless Nixon acknowledges it. Nixon,<br />\nafter a week of indecision, decides that the South is vital to his<br />\nsuccess. He quietly acknowledges<br />\nthe Wallace deal. At this point<br />\nmany moderate and all liberal Republicans desert his ticket.<br />\nWith the World Series over,<br />\nboth candidates begin to seriously<br />\ncampaign. Johnson works hard in<br />\nthe South where he tries to revive<br />\nthe traditional Democratic machinery and in the North where he<br />\ntries to activate lethargic and discouraged liberal Democrats. In the<br />\nSouth, Johnson assumes an ever<br />\nincreasing hawkishness, while in<br />\nthe North he talks about economic<br />\nreforms, although keeping away as<br />\nmuch as possible from civil rights<br />\nissues.<br />\nNixon campaigns energetically<br />\nthrough the South, and in the traditional Republican areas of the<br />\nmidwest while Reagan works the<br />\nWest Coast and the urban centers.<br />\nThe Nixon-Reagan ticket advo-<br /><br />\nPRESIDENTIAL candidate Wallace announced plans for the Lincoln Penny.<br />\ncates a stronger line in Vietnam,<br />\n\"a beef-up of the forces of law and<br />\norder\" and \"a return to the traditional American morality.\" In this<br />\nvein, Reagan suggests widespread<br />\nre-institution of the death penalty<br />\nas well as suppression of dissenting<br />\nwar views.<br />\nAt the beginning of the campaign, there is some talk of television debates, but this soon dies<br />\nout when it becomes apparent that<br />\nneither campaign manager believes<br />\nhis man can profit from a live television appearance. The idea of a<br />\ndebate between the Vice-Presidential candidates takes hold, however, Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Reagan are both found anxious to go<br />\nat it, a fascinating encounter ensues and a good time is had by all.<br />\nIn early October a new N.L.F.<br />\noffensive is opened in Vietnam.<br />\nThe 700,000 American troops stationed there as well as the South<br />\nVietnamese army are forced to fall<br />\nback. Somebody panics (or perhaps obeys an order from the<br /><br />\nRUMOR has it that Johnson is considering a new running mate.<br /><br />\nl<br /><br />\nWhite House) and for the third<br />\ntime in history an American nuclear device is used to slaughter<br />\nhuman beings.<br />\nThe response to the atomic<br />\nbombings is violent.

I<br />\nstrongly question this group's<br />\nright to imply to the world the<br />\nfeelings of the Hopkins community<br />\nby taking its own stand on the<br />\nquestion of Vietnam. It was my<br />\nfear that the council was not fulfilling its obligation to the students<br />\nthat prompted my \"walkout.\"<br />\nAt the March fourth Student<br />\nCouncil meeting,the Council handily defeated (10-5) my motion to<br />\ndefer the policy statement on the<br />\nwar until after the national college<br /><br />\npresidential preference primary,<br />\nChoice '68. It then proceeded to<br />\ninitiate the mechanism that would<br />\nresult in the issuance of the Council's opinion, not the students', on<br />\nVietnam. At this point, the Council lost its quorum, and action was<br />\ndeferred to this past Monday evening. At this time, a suggestion (the<br />\nsame one that I had proposed the<br />\nweek before) to delay further action on the war until after the<br />\nChoice '68 results could be tabulated was moved. After no debate,<br />\nthis was adopted by a vote of<br />\n21-1-1. The sudden change of heart<br />\nby the Council showed that drastic<br />\nor even dramatic action is sometimes needed to stimulate it to fulfill its obligations. No doubt a<br />\nstatement on the war will come<br />\nout by May of this year, but it will<br />\nbe a statement that represents the<br />\nstudents' as well as the Council's<br /><br />\nfeelings.<br />\nNow it seems that my action<br />\nwas not a \"flagrantly irresponsible\" one, but rather one which<br />\nwill help to maintain and uphold<br />\nthe Student Council's obligation<br />\n- - to present opinions not of itself, but the students.<br />\nKen Borow<br />\nS.C.

In the goal, where<br />\nsecond unit All-American and cocaptain Geoff Berlin is capably<br />\nbacked by junior John Kelly, there<br />\nshould be no problems.<br />\nThe midfield units, sources of<br />\noccasional trouble last season, are<br />\nprobably the club's most dubious<br />\narea, though full recoveries from<br />\nsome '67 injuries and good performances from sophomores and re-<br /><br />\npositioned attackmen could brighten the picture considerably. Comprising a temporary four-man first<br />\ngroup, locus of major team physical problems, are juniors Charles<br />\nGoodell(14 goals and a third team<br />\nAll-American spot), Phil Buck (out<br />\nwith a collapsed lung last year),<br />\nand John Gorczyk(11 scores), and<br />\nsenior Bob Carter (10).
