We are flatly opposed to any such proposition.<br />\nExtra-curricular activities are essentially for the undergraduate<br />\nand for him alone. To allow graduate students to head non-athletic<br />\nactivities is to allow them to usurp the places rightfully belonging to<br />\nothers. Furthermore, this practice would keep men from onouncing<br />\ntheir candidacy for staff' positions. A freshman would argue, and<br />\nrightfully so, that there would be no advantage in trying out for a<br />\npublication if there happened to be two or three men in their sophomore year already on the staff who meant to stay at college five years.'<br />\nFor he would have no chance of earning a major board of control<br />\nposition. In his senior year he would he outranked by these men<br />\nin their fifth year of residence.<br />\nThe case of men in their first or second year of the New Plan<br />\nis entirely different. They are on a par with their fellows, not having the advantage ?ff. the extra year. But as soon as their fourth<br />\nyear of residence is completed, they should automatically cease to be<br />\neligible for Board of Control positions. , Let them gracefully yield<br />\ntheir place to therising college generation.<br />\n, This stand applies not only to' men who have Completed four<br />\nyears at Johns Hopkins, but to those who have spent .part of their<br />\nallotted time elsewhere. Although it be unjust, it is a recognized \u2022<br />\nfact that an upperclassman receives more consideration from the incumbents, and less difficulty in attaining a staff position than a fresh'<br />\nman. He is not compelled to, go through the long period of trial<br />\nand training to which the yearlings are subjected.

Ile referred to<br />\nMooney and Billings, labor leaders<br />\nwho have served nearl\u2022 thirteen<br />\nyears in jail on what almost everyone who has studied the case believes<br />\nto be a framed charge, as habitual<br />\ncriminals. As a matter of fact<br />\nMooney had a perfectly clean record<br />\nprior to 1916, while Billings had<br />\nserved a two year term on the disputed accusation of carrying exploPt16 both<br />\n,i<br />\nsives on a street car.

Since their<br />\nconviction the following new evidence has been brought to light.<br />\n1. Several large California corporations had for three years been<br />\ntrying \"to get\" Mooney and Billings,<br />\nbecause their work in organizing labor was regarded as highly obnoxious.

A commission appointed by<br />\nPresident Wilson, and headed by<br />\nSecretary of Labor William B.

We are flatly opposed to any such proposition.<br />\nExtra-curricular activities are essentially for the undergraduate<br />\nand for him alone. To allow graduate students to head non-athletic<br />\nactivities is to allow them to usurp the places rightfully belonging to<br />\nothers. Furthermore, this practice would keep men from onouncing<br />\ntheir candidacy for staff' positions. A freshman would argue, and<br />\nrightfully so, that there would be no advantage in trying out for a<br />\npublication if there happened to be two or three men in their sophomore year already on the staff who meant to stay at college five years.'<br />\nFor he would have no chance of earning a major board of control<br />\nposition. In his senior year he would he outranked by these men<br />\nin their fifth year of residence.<br />\nThe case of men in their first or second year of the New Plan<br />\nis entirely different. They are on a par with their fellows, not having the advantage ?ff. the extra year. But as soon as their fourth<br />\nyear of residence is completed, they should automatically cease to be<br />\neligible for Board of Control positions. , Let them gracefully yield<br />\ntheir place to therising college generation.<br />\n, This stand applies not only to' men who have Completed four<br />\nyears at Johns Hopkins, but to those who have spent .part of their<br />\nallotted time elsewhere. Although it be unjust, it is a recognized \u2022<br />\nfact that an upperclassman receives more consideration from the incumbents, and less difficulty in attaining a staff position than a fresh'<br />\nman. He is not compelled to, go through the long period of trial<br />\nand training to which the yearlings are subjected. Since he is given<br />\npreferential treatment as a candidate, he should accept the fact that<br />\nit will be more difficult for him to attain the, heights in his 'chosen<br />\nactivity.<br />\nWe do not think that thc activities will suffer greatly, if the five\"<br />\nyear man is prohibited from leading them. If he is a man of unusual ability he will have attained his major position in the four years<br />\nat his disposal. If he is not unusually capable there will be someone<br />\nin the senior class equally as well qualified to guide the destinies of<br />\nthe activity as he.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nHERE. has<br /><br />\na<br />\nCOW PATHS<br />\nomEwooD is recognized as being one of the most beautiful cob<br />\nlege sites in the country.
