There is talk of a magazine, there<br />\nis a little enthusiasm, and there are discussions. First, it is decided that such a magazine could not be financed at Hopkins.<br />\nThen the less hopeful among the protagonists lose heart because<br />\nthey become fearful about the available material on the campus.<br />\nUnfortunately, it seems that both objections are sorrowfully valid.<br />\nA half-hearted attempt was begun in the NEWS-LETTER when<br />\nthe \"Yes and No\" column was inaugurated a few years ago. Contributions were solicited, but most that have been received have<br />\nbeen poor if not mediocre. Either there is little literary talent<br />\non the campus or else it is inarticulate as far as the campus is<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nThe coming of spring has, however, made us optimistic. We<br />\nfully realize that it is true that there are no Bertrand Russells or<br />\nAnatole Frances or George Gordons among the undergraduates,<br />\nbut it would be too awful a truth to face if there were no talent<br />\nwhatsoever in Johns Hopkins. We believe that with active<br />\nencouragement, both from the faculty and from graduate students, writers of ability can be unearthed.<br />\nOur optimism has ripened into ambition. We believe that<br />\nalthough financial reasons preclude the possibility of a magazine<br />\nin the University, it is entirely feasible that a page in the NEWSLETTER can be devoted to this purpose every week or possibly<br />\ntwice every week. We express our confidence with one qualification, however. In order for literary expression to be kept on<br />\na high plane, the cooperation' of the faculty and students in the<br />\ngraduate departments is indispensable for the volume of acceptable<br />\nweekly contributions from undergraduates alone would be too<br />\nsmall to justify any effort. Alumni contributions will also be<br />\nwelcomed.<br />\nAs we believe that this cooperation can be secured, we shall<br />\nattempt the experiment for the remainder of the semester. Every<br />\nTuesday the -editoriarpage-of the NMS-LETTER will be devoted<br />\nto articles, stories, or poems by Hopkins people\u2014faculty, graduates, undergraduates. We invite you to contribute\u2014please try<br />\nto limit your wordiness to one thousand words, though we specify<br />\nno minimum.<br />\nWe are conducting this experiment as a challenge. It has<br />\noften been said that Hopkins students cannot or will not support<br />\na literary periodical; such an assertion can be disproved, and, we<br />\nhope will be.<br />\n<br />\nUSE<br />\n<br />\nYES and NO<br />\nJust had a horrible thought. I was supposing, which is iii<br />\nitself a dangerous pastime, and among other suppositions, most<br />\nof them relevant to weather ;\u2014whether or not I can cram everything in four short weeks, bad weather, Baltimore weather, and<br />\nwhether to write this column now, or later, there appeared suddenly and without warning this monstrous hypothesis: suppose<br />\nthe editor of this admirable journal should say, \"Write something<br />\nof particular interest to the undergraduate body.\" Now isn't that<br />\na pleasant thought for a peaceful mind on a spring morning? No.<br />\nWhat would it he? I have considered while regarding the<br />\nmanner in which that first paragraph mars an otherwise spotless<br />\nsheet. Somebody once decided that it was even more pleasurable<br />\nto sully a clean sheet of white paper than to make foot-prints on<br />\nan unknown expanse of snow. Either is certainly an example<br />\nof the very human tendency to improve on perfection. Which has<br />\nnothing to do with the case.<br />\nIt wouldn't be studies. Undergraduates are young ;\u2014younger than their years, which makes them correspond to the average<br />\nkindergarten child, and the natural impulse of youth is to live.<br />\nStudy produces books, of which the number is already far too<br />\ngreat. Think what a splendid blaze all the books in the world<br />\nwould make. Our own library would produce quite a tidy little<br />\nbonfire, but what would the librarians do then, poor things? Why,<br />\nthey'd fly to the Barn, to keep themselves ... All of which proves<br />\nthe statement about kindergarten children.<br />\nTo return to the subject. . . . What is the subject? Every<br />\narticle, even in the NEWS-LETTER, should have a subject, every<br />\nparagraph should have a topic sentence, every sentence a subject<br />\nand a verb. That reminds me of English composition, whose<br />\ncoming abolition I thoroughly abhor. It has always served as a<br />\nsort of Bromo-Seltzer for heads giddy with mistaken ideas about<br />\nthe rah-rah college life which most freshmen bring along as a<br />\nprep-school heritage. Its effect was sobering, not to say. depressing. To enable them to write for the college paper, all entering<br />\nstudents assuredly need this course.<br />\nWould it he an article on a topic of current interest? I think<br />\nnot. Sacco and Vanzetti did something, or if they didn't, they<br />\nmight as well have, because they got burned anyway. That's all<br />\n1 know about it. Who knows any more? Speak up, O'Dunne.<br />\nSpeaking of O'Dunne, I regret to note that he is slowing down.<br />\nThere are only two hurrying seniors, and Arnold's rush is more<br />\nnervous than business-like; Gene always seems to be sharing the<br />\nworries of Dr. Goodnow, President Coolidge, and God Almighty.<br />\nTherefore, it was shocking and disappointing to see him seated,<br />\noutside of class.<br />\nObviously, I have digressed. 'Digressions are peculiar things.<br />\nFar more natural to the human mind, I believe, than orderly<br />\ntopic-sentence thinking. Conversations are almost entirely digression. Thousands of friendly arguments which originally concerned one definite question, have shifted gradually into ordinary<br />\nand rather catty gossip.<br />\nGossip! That's it! The thing of particular interest to undergraduates. The boon of virtuous or hypocritical men, the dread<br />\nof sinners. Gossip about anything, from alcohol to. zoology. . . .<br />\nI will be contradicted, I hope. I've been contradicted once before,<br />\nostensibly because I wrote something which wasn't true. That's<br />\na peculiar cause for criticism. One never tells the truth when<br />\nthe lie is more interesting. One never, even in the rare event that<br />\nhe knows it, tells the truth about himself. But just allow the<br />\nbored young man to dig his teeth into a succulent morsel of scandalous truth about somebody else, and you have the thing \"of<br />\nparticular interest to undergraduates.\"<br />\nI cannot possibly expand this thought further, it was a very<br />\nlimited subject anyway, and even without regarding these bounds<br />\nI have come to an impasse. if I had not just experienced a<br />\nwearisome and enervating quiz, I might concoct a rhyme, but that,<br />\nunder the circumstances, is out of the question.

There is talk of a magazine, there<br />\nis a little enthusiasm, and there are discussions. First, it is decided that such a magazine could not be financed at Hopkins.<br />\nThen the less hopeful among the protagonists lose heart because<br />\nthey become fearful about the available material on the campus.<br />\nUnfortunately, it seems that both objections are sorrowfully valid.<br />\nA half-hearted attempt was begun in the NEWS-LETTER when<br />\nthe \"Yes and No\" column was inaugurated a few years ago. Contributions were solicited, but most that have been received have<br />\nbeen poor if not mediocre. Either there is little literary talent<br />\non the campus or else it is inarticulate as far as the campus is<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nThe coming of spring has, however, made us optimistic. We<br />\nfully realize that it is true that there are no Bertrand Russells or<br />\nAnatole Frances or George Gordons among the undergraduates,<br />\nbut it would be too awful a truth to face if there were no talent<br />\nwhatsoever in Johns Hopkins. We believe that with active<br />\nencouragement, both from the faculty and from graduate students, writers of ability can be unearthed.<br />\nOur optimism has ripened into ambition. We believe that<br />\nalthough financial reasons preclude the possibility of a magazine<br />\nin the University, it is entirely feasible that a page in the NEWSLETTER can be devoted to this purpose every week or possibly<br />\ntwice every week. We express our confidence with one qualification, however. In order for literary expression to be kept on<br />\na high plane, the cooperation' of the faculty and students in the<br />\ngraduate departments is indispensable for the volume of acceptable<br />\nweekly contributions from undergraduates alone would be too<br />\nsmall to justify any effort. Alumni contributions will also be<br />\nwelcomed.<br />\nAs we believe that this cooperation can be secured, we shall<br />\nattempt the experiment for the remainder of the semester. Every<br />\nTuesday the -editoriarpage-of the NMS-LETTER will be devoted<br />\nto articles, stories, or poems by Hopkins people\u2014faculty, graduates, undergraduates. We invite you to contribute\u2014please try<br />\nto limit your wordiness to one thousand words, though we specify<br />\nno minimum.<br />\nWe are conducting this experiment as a challenge. It has<br />\noften been said that Hopkins students cannot or will not support<br />\na literary periodical; such an assertion can be disproved, and, we<br />\nhope will be.<br /><br />\nUSE<br /><br />\nYES and NO<br />\nJust had a horrible thought. I was supposing, which is iii<br />\nitself a dangerous pastime, and among other suppositions, most<br />\nof them relevant to weather ;\u2014whether or not I can cram everything in four short weeks, bad weather, Baltimore weather, and<br />\nwhether to write this column now, or later, there appeared suddenly and without warning this monstrous hypothesis: suppose<br />\nthe editor of this admirable journal should say, \"Write something<br />\nof particular interest to the undergraduate body.\" Now isn't that<br />\na pleasant thought for a peaceful mind on a spring morning? No.<br />\nWhat would it he? I have considered while regarding the<br />\nmanner in which that first paragraph mars an otherwise spotless<br />\nsheet. Somebody once decided that it was even more pleasurable<br />\nto sully a clean sheet of white paper than to make foot-prints on<br />\nan unknown expanse of snow. Either is certainly an example<br />\nof the very human tendency to improve on perfection. Which has<br />\nnothing to do with the case.<br />\nIt wouldn't be studies. Undergraduates are young ;\u2014younger than their years, which makes them correspond to the average<br />\nkindergarten child, and the natural impulse of youth is to live.<br />\nStudy produces books, of which the number is already far too<br />\ngreat. Think what a splendid blaze all the books in the world<br />\nwould make. Our own library would produce quite a tidy little<br />\nbonfire, but what would the librarians do then, poor things? Why,<br />\nthey'd fly to the Barn, to keep themselves ... All of which proves<br />\nthe statement about kindergarten children.<br />\nTo return to the subject. . . . What is the subject? Every<br />\narticle, even in the NEWS-LETTER, should have a subject, every<br />\nparagraph should have a topic sentence, every sentence a subject<br />\nand a verb. That reminds me of English composition, whose<br />\ncoming abolition I thoroughly abhor. It has always served as a<br />\nsort of Bromo-Seltzer for heads giddy with mistaken ideas about<br />\nthe rah-rah college life which most freshmen bring along as a<br />\nprep-school heritage. Its effect was sobering, not to say. depressing. To enable them to write for the college paper, all entering<br />\nstudents assuredly need this course.<br />\nWould it he an article on a topic of current interest? I think<br />\nnot. Sacco and Vanzetti did something, or if they didn't, they<br />\nmight as well have, because they got burned anyway. That's all<br />\n1 know about it. Who knows any more? Speak up, O'Dunne.<br />\nSpeaking of O'Dunne, I regret to note that he is slowing down.<br />\nThere are only two hurrying seniors, and Arnold's rush is more<br />\nnervous than business-like; Gene always seems to be sharing the<br />\nworries of Dr. Goodnow, President Coolidge, and God Almighty.<br />\nTherefore, it was shocking and disappointing to see him seated,<br />\noutside of class.<br />\nObviously, I have digressed. 'Digressions are peculiar things.<br />\nFar more natural to the human mind, I believe, than orderly<br />\ntopic-sentence thinking. Conversations are almost entirely digression. Thousands of friendly arguments which originally concerned one definite question, have shifted gradually into ordinary<br />\nand rather catty gossip.<br />\nGossip! That's it! The thing of particular interest to undergraduates. The boon of virtuous or hypocritical men, the dread<br />\nof sinners. Gossip about anything, from alcohol to. zoology. . . .<br />\nI will be contradicted, I hope. I've been contradicted once before,<br />\nostensibly because I wrote something which wasn't true. That's<br />\na peculiar cause for criticism. One never tells the truth when<br />\nthe lie is more interesting. One never, even in the rare event that<br />\nhe knows it, tells the truth about himself. But just allow the<br />\nbored young man to dig his teeth into a succulent morsel of scandalous truth about somebody else, and you have the thing \"of<br />\nparticular interest to undergraduates.\"<br />\nI cannot possibly expand this thought further, it was a very<br />\nlimited subject anyway, and even without regarding these bounds<br />\nI have come to an impasse. if I had not just experienced a<br />\nwearisome and enervating quiz, I might concoct a rhyme, but that,<br />\nunder the circumstances, is out of the question.
