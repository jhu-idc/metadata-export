This brings to mind \u2022a<br />\nsituation that I know the<br />\nChemistry department and other<br />\ndepartments of the University are<br />\nhaving to deal with. A recent law,<br />\napproximately two years old,<br />\nwhich I feel the University<br />\nshould be responsible for, and<br />\nnot, say, the individual<br />\ndepartments. About two years<br />\nago, a new government<br />\ndepartment was formed called<br />\nOSCEA, whidh has to do with<br />\nsafety in Universities and<br />\nCompanies\u2014safety for their<br />\n<br />\nemployees. Now this sounds very<br />\ngood, but it's also a bit of a pain,<br />\nbecause the OSCEA restrictions<br />\nare very strict. Hopkins has<br />\nrecently become one the the test<br />\ncases for OSCEA suits in a<br />\nUniverstiy, and there's no suit<br />\nyet that I know of, but there<br />\nhave been some OSCEA<br />\ninspections, and frankly Hopkins<br />\nflunked. Now there's a lot of<br />\ndebate about whether this is<br />\nHopkins' responsibility to deal<br />\nwith the safety problems in the<br />\nbuilding, or the older buildings of<br />\nthe University in particular,<br />\nwhich were not really meant for<br />\na lot of the research that's going<br />\n<br />\non now, or whether it's the<br />\ndepartments' problem. That's a<br />\nhot question about where the<br />\nmoney comes from, and I think<br />\nthe Board of Trustees whould<br />\ninvestigate it.<br />\nHunt: Well, I'm in agreement<br />\nwith both Bob and Dan. I have to<br />\nsay that I see the most critical<br />\nfunction of the Board of Trustees<br />\nas financial and budgetary policy<br />\nmaking. And consequently, I<br />\nwould like to deal with issues of<br />\nthat nature. One area which I<br />\nbelieve now that deserves<br />\nimmediate attention is the<br />\nexpansion of the University in<br />\nacademic areas. It's a proposal<br />\nthat's continually being made,<br />\nbut nothing seems to be getting<br />\n<br />\ndone in terms of reinstating<br />\ndepartments. For the Humanities<br />\nand Social Sciences, and I believe<br />\nthat the Trustees have the power<br />\nto allocate the funds to do this<br />\nsort of thing, on the Board of<br />\n.Trustees I would probably be a<br />\nchampion of that cause In<br />\nconjunction with that, the<br />\nUniveristy has a real need to<br />\nbridge thes gaps between the<br />\nexisting institutions within the<br />\nUniversity.

One of<br />\nthe students involved in last week's fire setting incident in<br />\nLazear House chose to appeal the decision made in the<br />\nmatter by Dean of Students Robert J. Fitzpatrick and<br />\nsucceeded in having punishment reduced considerable.<br />\nOnce the student decided to appeal his case, an appeals<br />\nboard was constituted, the case was heard and a decision was<br />\nquickly reached and so the discipline plan worked out over<br />\nmonths of wrangling false starts and dispute appears to be a<br />\nsuccess in all respects except one. The major point of<br />\ncontention comes over the fact that asit now stands the<br />\nquestion of how long a student has to file an appeal remains<br />\nopen. This is a dangerous flaw. If a student were to delay for<br />\nas long as a year his decision to take his case to an appeals<br />\nboard, memories could fade and some of the people<br />\ninvolved could leave the University, rendering the entire<br />\nappeals process a dangerous absurdity.<br />\nWhile it is certainly to be hoped that no more incidents of<br />\nthe type that occurred in Lazear House last week will occur<br />\nin the future, the discipline procedure should still be equal to<br />\nthe test of possible future appeals The only way that the<br />\nfuture viability of the plan can be assured is for a time limit<br />\nto be instituted on appealing. Otherwise a student could<br />\nmake a mockery of the entire process by waiting for<br />\nmemories to become dim, for persons involved in the<br />\nincident to leave Hopkins and for possible evidence\u2014a<br />\ncharred door for example\u2014to disappear. It should certainly<br />\nnot be difficult for the Student Council and the Homewood<br />\nAdvisory Council to work out an acceptable provision on the<br />\ntime limit question.

Thoroughly enjoying the<br />\nfresh morning air, I began to think<br />\nof what a great, permissive<br />\ncommunity this Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity really is. I had no<br />\nsooner commenced my thoughts<br />\nwhen the silence of the still-dark<br />\nmorning was broken by the<br />\nv ociferations of two Johns<br />\nHopkins University patrolmen<br />\n(whom I late, learned were<br />\n\"alerted to their duties\" by the not<br />\nmore than dozen naked bodies<br />\ndancing in the freshman quad). I<br />\nthought to myself, \"surely they're<br />\nnot shouting at me, for I am fully<br />\nclothed!\" Nevertheless, I turned<br />\naround, only to catch sight of two<br />\nelderly gentlemen standing outside<br />\nof a Johns Hopkins University<br />\npatrol car, flailing their arms as if<br />\nbeating the air. I and my adidas<br />\nfleetfootedly sped to the campus<br />\npatrolmen, to see if I could help<br />\nthem in whatever their problem<br />\nwas. I was met by such questions<br />\nas \"what are you doing?,\" \"how<br />\ndid you get here?,\" and \"why are<br />\nyour buddies running around in<br />\nthe nude...don't they know that's<br />\nindecent exposure?\" I was waiting<br />\nfor the ultimate question, i.e.,<br />\n\"why are your clothes on?\", but to<br />\nmy disappointment, it was never<br />\nposed.<br />\nIn any case, I was asked the<br />\n\"question with a thousand<br />\nanswers\", that is, \"Sonny, where's<br />\nyour ID card?\" I produced the<br />\nidentification, along with my Saga<br />\nmeal ticket with a myriad of<br />\nhalf-punched holes in it. Both were<br />\nexamined thoroughly and returned<br />\nto the owner, whence I received a<br />\nfather-to-son lecture on the<br />\ndangers of running in the nude:<br />\n\"Those guys can get arrested and<br />\nlocked up in jail for that...you<br />\ncould catch a cold!\" I was also<br />\ninformed that the Baltimore City<br />\nPolice were waiting at the gates of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University in<br />\nexpectation of catching any of the<br />\n\"Hopkins-hinies\" who happened to<br />\ntrot by. Finally I was given the<br />\nsupreme priviledge (by virtue of<br />\nthe JHU Campus Police) to break<br />\nall the delicious news to my fellow<br />\nstudents! (\"Such thrills and I<br />\nthank you so much,\" I thought.)<br />\nI tried to explain to the cops<br />\nthat these young Hoppies were not<br />\nsmashing windows, stealing cars,<br />\nbreaking into peoples' dorms, or<br />\n<br />\nfriends<br />\n<br />\ne q.c-vcne<br />\n<br />\nwas<br />\n<br />\nonly greeted by<br />\nexpressions on the faces of<br />\n<br />\nidentical<br />\nthe campus patrolmen, that being a<br />\nMona Lisa smile on the lips, and in<br />\nthe eyes a \"boy-have-you-got-a-lotto-learn\" look. Realizing that they<br />\nwere \"through\" with me,<br />\n(golly-gee-whiz they didn't even<br />\nfrisk me this time...but what would<br />\nthey do if they Caught a<br />\nstreaker?!), I bowed out gracefully<br />\nand took a stand on the sidelines,<br />\nto absorb a bit of the humor of the<br />\ntwo innocently-clothed cops being<br />\ninundated by twelve young men<br />\nonly seeking some harmless<br />\ninexpensive type of amusement in<br />\ntheir own backyard...the freshman<br />\nquad!<br />\nStreakingly yours<br />\nJohn J.

After a recent<br />\nexamination in which the grades<br />\nfell very low with approximately<br />\n78 students failing and 50 students<br />\ngetting D's in his \"non-curved\"<br />\ncourse, whereas in past years he<br />\nwould curve the grades to a normal<br />\nmean, Dr. Gryder instead<br />\nannounced that those students<br />\nwho had done very poorly in his<br />\ncourse first semester and very<br />\npoorly on this extremely difficult<br />\nexam should consider dropping his<br />\ncourse He said that the attrition<br />\nrate was not as large as it has been<br />\nin past years.<br />\nIt is quite a surprise to see Dr.<br />\nGryder so concerned with<br />\n<br />\nobtaining a higher attrition rate<br />\n\u201811\"Ci sscit,i?`,4,12.43<br />\nIll the history of our school<br />\naccording to Admissions Director<br />\n<br />\nJohn Riina. In a recent<br />\nNews-Letter article, Dr. Gryder<br />\nquoted statistics that 80ck of<br />\nHopkins seniors applying to med<br />\nschool are accepted and that a<br />\nHopkins student with a 3.0 average<br />\nhas a good chance of being<br />\nadmitted to med school. Despite<br />\nthe fact that these figures were<br />\ncontested at a recent discussion<br />\nwith Dr. Fishbein from our<br />\nmedical school and pre-medical<br />\nadvisor Dr. Debusky, is Dr. Gryder<br />\nengaging in 'doublethink.'<br />\nCertainly if Dr. Gryder's figures<br />\nare to be believed, a low attrition<br />\nrate in his course compaired to<br />\nprevious years should be<br />\nencouraged, not discouraged. One<br />\ncan only take this as a \"sign\" that<br />\nnot all may be as our<br />\nadministration prefers to say.<br />\nIt was to this \"sign\" of<br />\ndouble-talk from our school and<br />\nfrom Dr. Gryder deciding to<br />\nparadoxically take a \"hard line\" on<br />\nhis students,- that a dummy was<br />\nhung in effigy. In our school where<br />\nthere are very few controls upon<br />\nour faculty on how to run their<br />\ncourses and even less of a chance<br />\nto effect change or protest upon<br />\ntheir actions, Dr. Gryder was hung<br />\nin effigy as an effective protest to<br />\nhis new line of action. I was<br />\nshocked to see the censorship of<br />\nthis protest when Mr. Tetlaff<br />\nremoved the _dummy\u2014isn't it clear<br />\n<br />\nand for the rest of the class of 74,<br />\nmeans at Homewood.<br />\nthere was a realization that we too,<br />\nBut this year was a little<br />\nin<br />\na way, had begun our last season<br />\ndifferent, too.

Why<br />\ndo you want to be a Young<br />\nTrustee?<br />\nKathleen Hunt: I think<br />\nprobably listing qualifications<br />\nsuch as activities and that sort of<br />\nthing in the undergraduate school<br />\nis somewhat unrealistic. I think<br />\nbeing a graduate of the<br />\nUniversity is probably the<br />\nprimary qualification that can all<br />\nlist. I have lived in the<br />\ndormitories for three years, two<br />\nas' housemaster, and have had<br />\nclose contact with the<br />\nundergraduates and the various<br />\ngroups of them without<br />\ncommitting myself to a particular<br />\nfaction of the University. I<br />\ngained a lot of experience that<br />\nway in the needs of students,<br />\nhow they're being met the the<br />\nschool and how they perceive<br />\ntheir needs to be met in the<br />\nfuture. I would like therefore to<br />\ncontribute to the Trustees this<br />\nexperience and these perceptions<br />\nthat I have found over my three<br />\nyears here. As a person having<br />\ngone through the transition of<br />\ncoeducation at the University,<br />\nand being a woman in that<br />\ntransition, I think that I have a<br />\nlot to offer in terms of a<br />\nstudent's view and a view of<br />\nvarious sectors of the<br />\nundergraduate community.<br />\nRobert Gray: I feel that my<br />\nstrongest qualifications to<br />\nbecome a Trustee is my desire to<br />\nbecome a trustee and my<br />\nperception of myself that I will<br />\nwork well within such a body<br />\nand as a representative of the<br />\nentire University as a Trustee.<br />\nWhile we are elected by the<br />\nundergraduates of the campus, I<br />\nfeel that the YT would be a<br />\ndoing a disservice both to the<br />\nBoard of Trustees and to the<br />\nHomewood campus in that we<br />\nwould be representative of the<br />\nHomewood campus per se. We<br />\nare YT of the University's five<br />\ncampuses. I feel that with this in<br />\nmind, a person should go into the<br />\nTrustees open and willing to<br />\nwork and be able to work in such<br />\na group, and this is why I feel I<br />\nam suited to become a Young<br />\nTrustee. I don't think that any<br />\nparticular faction o-n the'<br />\nHomewood campus should be<br />\nrepresented. I ,feel that this is a<br />\nUniversity-wide thing, and not<br />\njust Homewood campus. This is<br />\nbasically why I feel that you<br />\nmust be open and must be<br />\ncompletely honest and be willing<br />\nto work with a large body of<br />\npeople\u2014of men I should say,<br />\nbecause there are no women on<br />\nthe board, it's say to say. I feel<br />\nthat we must be open and above<br />\nboard with them to be able to<br />\naccomplish anything at this<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nDaniel McDonald: I feel my<br />\nmajor qualification for the Board<br />\nof Trustees, as far as University<br />\nactivities go, is the job that I've<br />\nhad the last two years as student<br />\ncustodian and dormitory<br />\nassistant manager, which has<br />\nbeen a position of great trust. I<br />\nthink you can ask almost any of<br />\nthe girls in the dorms how<br />\ntrusting they have to be of us.<br />\n<br />\nThere's another qualification that<br />\nI feel is very important to any<br />\nposition a person cares to take<br />\non, and that concerns<br />\nmotivation. Frankly, I'm very<br />\nskeptical of people who would<br />\nsay \"I want to be a Board of<br />\nTrustees member because this<br />\nUniversity has done great things<br />\nfor me and I'd like to pay them<br />\nback. Although this is true in my<br />\ncase that I feel this way. if that<br />\nwere to be my only motivation<br />\nfor becoming a Board of Trustee<br />\nmember, I would not be running.<br />\nI do consider my main<br />\nmotivation for running for the<br />\nBoard of Trustees as purely<br />\nselfish. That is, I feel as though I<br />\nwish to be a part of the<br />\nUniversity as far as a constructive<br />\npart, and that would give me<br />\nsatisfaction. It is this satisfaction<br />\nwhich I think is the proper<br />\nmotivation for doing anything<br />\nthat a person does.<br />\nChuck Slonim: I think first<br />\nof all that my strong points<br />\nwould be my activities that I<br />\nhave engaged in while at school.<br />\nI've been in almost every<br />\ndepartment of this school, from<br />\nAdmissions to athletics to<br />\nStudent Union to Student<br />\nCouncil, working with applicants<br />\n<br />\non Blue Key, and all in all, just<br />\nabout every department. I've<br />\nseen how they work and I've<br />\nbecome involved with in the<br />\nworking of the University, and I<br />\nfeel that my experience would<br />\nhelp me out as far as looking<br />\nahead as to what the school<br />\nneeds in different departments.<br />\nI've seen some pitfalls, some<br />\nstrong points, but as a -Board<br />\nmember I think that I can initiate<br />\nsoem of my ideas or at least<br />\nmake them known knowing the<br />\nfeelings of the students because<br />\nI've worked with quite a majority<br />\nof the students at this school. I<br />\nthink my strong point is that I<br />\ncan relate what I know from our<br />\nexperiences, meaning mine along<br />\nwith other students, to be able to<br />\nhelp everybody -involved not<br />\nreally leaving one person out of<br />\nit. I think I have enough<br />\nknowledge of the differnt types<br />\nof people on this campus to use<br />\nthat knowledge towards making<br />\none idea stretch a long way. in<br />\nterms of everybody so that<br />\neverybody's satisfied, not just<br />\none group or another group. I<br />\nthink I have a knowledge of the<br />\npeople on campus, just from my<br />\nwork with them.<br />\nThe only thing I really know<br />\nabout Young Trustees is what<br />\nmost boards of trustees are, that<br />\nis, overseeing organization that is<br />\nthe voting body for much of the<br />\nlegislation that goes on in the<br />\nschool, or in any organization for<br />\nthat matter. Of course, I've never<br />\nparticipated on a Board of<br />\nTrustees. I can only look to see<br />\nthat I think that I can do a good<br />\njob carrying out whatever the<br />\nresponsibilities. I know I've tried<br />\nto look into it, I've asked over at<br />\nHomewood House 'What does<br />\nthe Board of Trustees do' and it's<br />\nkind of a vague answer, you<br />\nknow, \"you're one of the Board<br />\nof Trustees.\" But then when you<br />\nsay what does the Board of<br />\nTrustees do, then you just<br />\nactually have to go to a<br />\ndictionary and find out, well,<br />\nBoard of Trustees is..<br />\nI don't plan on promising<br />\nanything, I just plan to be an<br />\nactive member and a<br />\nhard-working member of the<br />\nBoard. If I find something that I<br />\nthink needs initiating by just an<br />\nidea before the Board. then I'll<br />\ndefinitely get a say at what I feel<br />\nI can't make any promises becaue<br />\nI don't know what'll be like until<br />\nI actually get into and see what<br />\npowers I can actually muster up<br />\n<br />\nChuck Slonim<br />\ncampaign. I would also like to see require much money which I<br />\nbuilding on campus. To put it don't know is available or not. I<br />\nanother way I'd like to see the don't know how feasible these<br />\nrational construction of new ideas are, but I would like to see<br />\nfacillities on campus, with point something done along these lines,<br />\nin mind the new Biology whereever possible.<br />\nMcDonald: I consider the<br />\nbuilding. I would like to see<br />\npurpose<br />\nof the Board two-fold;<br />\ncooperation between the entire<br />\none<br />\nis<br />\npretty<br />\nmuch a financial<br />\ncommunity<br />\nUniversity and the<br />\nwhich surrounds it. Hopkins caretaking part of the University.<br />\ncannot isolate itself from its That involves making sure the<br />\nmoney goes hwere it's meant to<br />\nsurrounding areas and I think<br />\nthat the Board of Trustees being go, as effeciently as possible, to<br />\nthe emminent collection of where it would do the most<br />\ngood. Now a lot of the decisions<br />\npeople that they are, should<br />\nof where the money would do<br />\ndevote some of their time to<br />\nsoothing community relations .the most,good is not really part<br />\nof the Board of Trustees' duty<br />\nwith the University, particularly<br />\naround the Homewood campus. I and that's up to the academic<br />\nparts of the Univesity, and also<br />\nwould also like to see<br />\ninvesticated the possibility of to the Studnet Affairs part in<br />\ndeveloping further which the Board has no<br />\ncommunications between various jurisdiction. Along the money<br />\ncampuses on school. There have lines, take an illustiation\u2014in<br />\nprevious years, I would have been<br />\nbeen various instances called to<br />\nvery much for the University<br />\nmy attention this year where lack<br />\nbuilding a new dormitory in<br />\nof communication has had dire<br />\nwhich<br />\nall the students could live<br />\neffects to the students,<br />\nand possible reduce the critical<br />\nparticularly between the Med<br />\nmass of students needed in order<br />\nSchool and the Homewood<br />\nto have an active campus life.<br />\ncampus undergraduates.

This brings to mind \u2022a<br />\nsituation that I know the<br />\nChemistry department and other<br />\ndepartments of the University are<br />\nhaving to deal with. A recent law,<br />\napproximately two years old,<br />\nwhich I feel the University<br />\nshould be responsible for, and<br />\nnot, say, the individual<br />\ndepartments. About two years<br />\nago, a new government<br />\ndepartment was formed called<br />\nOSCEA, whidh has to do with<br />\nsafety in Universities and<br />\nCompanies\u2014safety for their<br /><br />\nemployees. Now this sounds very<br />\ngood, but it's also a bit of a pain,<br />\nbecause the OSCEA restrictions<br />\nare very strict. Hopkins has<br />\nrecently become one the the test<br />\ncases for OSCEA suits in a<br />\nUniverstiy, and there's no suit<br />\nyet that I know of, but there<br />\nhave been some OSCEA<br />\ninspections, and frankly Hopkins<br />\nflunked. Now there's a lot of<br />\ndebate about whether this is<br />\nHopkins' responsibility to deal<br />\nwith the safety problems in the<br />\nbuilding, or the older buildings of<br />\nthe University in particular,<br />\nwhich were not really meant for<br />\na lot of the research that's going<br /><br />\non now, or whether it's the<br />\ndepartments' problem. That's a<br />\nhot question about where the<br />\nmoney comes from, and I think<br />\nthe Board of Trustees whould<br />\ninvestigate it.<br />\nHunt: Well, I'm in agreement<br />\nwith both Bob and Dan. I have to<br />\nsay that I see the most critical<br />\nfunction of the Board of Trustees<br />\nas financial and budgetary policy<br />\nmaking. And consequently, I<br />\nwould like to deal with issues of<br />\nthat nature. One area which I<br />\nbelieve now that deserves<br />\nimmediate attention is the<br />\nexpansion of the University in<br />\nacademic areas. It's a proposal<br />\nthat's continually being made,<br />\nbut nothing seems to be getting<br /><br />\ndone in terms of reinstating<br />\ndepartments. For the Humanities<br />\nand Social Sciences, and I believe<br />\nthat the Trustees have the power<br />\nto allocate the funds to do this<br />\nsort of thing, on the Board of<br />\n.Trustees I would probably be a<br />\nchampion of that cause In<br />\nconjunction with that, the<br />\nUniveristy has a real need to<br />\nbridge thes gaps between the<br />\nexisting institutions within the<br />\nUniversity.

One of<br />\nthe students involved in last week's fire setting incident in<br />\nLazear House chose to appeal the decision made in the<br />\nmatter by Dean of Students Robert J. Fitzpatrick and<br />\nsucceeded in having punishment reduced considerable.<br />\nOnce the student decided to appeal his case, an appeals<br />\nboard was constituted, the case was heard and a decision was<br />\nquickly reached and so the discipline plan worked out over<br />\nmonths of wrangling false starts and dispute appears to be a<br />\nsuccess in all respects except one. The major point of<br />\ncontention comes over the fact that asit now stands the<br />\nquestion of how long a student has to file an appeal remains<br />\nopen. This is a dangerous flaw. If a student were to delay for<br />\nas long as a year his decision to take his case to an appeals<br />\nboard, memories could fade and some of the people<br />\ninvolved could leave the University, rendering the entire<br />\nappeals process a dangerous absurdity.<br />\nWhile it is certainly to be hoped that no more incidents of<br />\nthe type that occurred in Lazear House last week will occur<br />\nin the future, the discipline procedure should still be equal to<br />\nthe test of possible future appeals The only way that the<br />\nfuture viability of the plan can be assured is for a time limit<br />\nto be instituted on appealing. Otherwise a student could<br />\nmake a mockery of the entire process by waiting for<br />\nmemories to become dim, for persons involved in the<br />\nincident to leave Hopkins and for possible evidence\u2014a<br />\ncharred door for example\u2014to disappear. It should certainly<br />\nnot be difficult for the Student Council and the Homewood<br />\nAdvisory Council to work out an acceptable provision on the<br />\ntime limit question.

Thoroughly enjoying the<br />\nfresh morning air, I began to think<br />\nof what a great, permissive<br />\ncommunity this Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity really is. I had no<br />\nsooner commenced my thoughts<br />\nwhen the silence of the still-dark<br />\nmorning was broken by the<br />\nv ociferations of two Johns<br />\nHopkins University patrolmen<br />\n(whom I late, learned were<br />\n\"alerted to their duties\" by the not<br />\nmore than dozen naked bodies<br />\ndancing in the freshman quad). I<br />\nthought to myself, \"surely they're<br />\nnot shouting at me, for I am fully<br />\nclothed!\" Nevertheless, I turned<br />\naround, only to catch sight of two<br />\nelderly gentlemen standing outside<br />\nof a Johns Hopkins University<br />\npatrol car, flailing their arms as if<br />\nbeating the air. I and my adidas<br />\nfleetfootedly sped to the campus<br />\npatrolmen, to see if I could help<br />\nthem in whatever their problem<br />\nwas. I was met by such questions<br />\nas \"what are you doing?,\" \"how<br />\ndid you get here?,\" and \"why are<br />\nyour buddies running around in<br />\nthe nude...don't they know that's<br />\nindecent exposure?\" I was waiting<br />\nfor the ultimate question, i.e.,<br />\n\"why are your clothes on?\", but to<br />\nmy disappointment, it was never<br />\nposed.<br />\nIn any case, I was asked the<br />\n\"question with a thousand<br />\nanswers\", that is, \"Sonny, where's<br />\nyour ID card?\" I produced the<br />\nidentification, along with my Saga<br />\nmeal ticket with a myriad of<br />\nhalf-punched holes in it. Both were<br />\nexamined thoroughly and returned<br />\nto the owner, whence I received a<br />\nfather-to-son lecture on the<br />\ndangers of running in the nude:<br />\n\"Those guys can get arrested and<br />\nlocked up in jail for that...you<br />\ncould catch a cold!\" I was also<br />\ninformed that the Baltimore City<br />\nPolice were waiting at the gates of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University in<br />\nexpectation of catching any of the<br />\n\"Hopkins-hinies\" who happened to<br />\ntrot by. Finally I was given the<br />\nsupreme priviledge (by virtue of<br />\nthe JHU Campus Police) to break<br />\nall the delicious news to my fellow<br />\nstudents! (\"Such thrills and I<br />\nthank you so much,\" I thought.)<br />\nI tried to explain to the cops<br />\nthat these young Hoppies were not<br />\nsmashing windows, stealing cars,<br />\nbreaking into peoples' dorms, or<br /><br />\nfriends<br /><br />\ne q.c-vcne<br /><br />\nwas<br /><br />\nonly greeted by<br />\nexpressions on the faces of<br /><br />\nidentical<br />\nthe campus patrolmen, that being a<br />\nMona Lisa smile on the lips, and in<br />\nthe eyes a \"boy-have-you-got-a-lotto-learn\" look. Realizing that they<br />\nwere \"through\" with me,<br />\n(golly-gee-whiz they didn't even<br />\nfrisk me this time...but what would<br />\nthey do if they Caught a<br />\nstreaker?!), I bowed out gracefully<br />\nand took a stand on the sidelines,<br />\nto absorb a bit of the humor of the<br />\ntwo innocently-clothed cops being<br />\ninundated by twelve young men<br />\nonly seeking some harmless<br />\ninexpensive type of amusement in<br />\ntheir own backyard...the freshman<br />\nquad!<br />\nStreakingly yours<br />\nJohn J.

In a recent<br />\nNews-Letter article, Dr. Gryder<br />\nquoted statistics that 80ck of<br />\nHopkins seniors applying to med<br />\nschool are accepted and that a<br />\nHopkins student with a 3.0 average<br />\nhas a good chance of being<br />\nadmitted to med school. Despite<br />\nthe fact that these figures were<br />\ncontested at a recent discussion<br />\nwith Dr. Fishbein from our<br />\nmedical school and pre-medical<br />\nadvisor Dr. Debusky, is Dr. Gryder<br />\nengaging in 'doublethink.'<br />\nCertainly if Dr. Gryder's figures<br />\nare to be believed, a low attrition<br />\nrate in his course compaired to<br />\nprevious years should be<br />\nencouraged, not discouraged. One<br />\ncan only take this as a \"sign\" that<br />\nnot all may be as our<br />\nadministration prefers to say.<br />\nIt was to this \"sign\" of<br />\ndouble-talk from our school and<br />\nfrom Dr. Gryder deciding to<br />\nparadoxically take a \"hard line\" on<br />\nhis students,- that a dummy was<br />\nhung in effigy. In our school where<br />\nthere are very few controls upon<br />\nour faculty on how to run their<br />\ncourses and even less of a chance<br />\nto effect change or protest upon<br />\ntheir actions, Dr. Gryder was hung<br />\nin effigy as an effective protest to<br />\nhis new line of action. I was<br />\nshocked to see the censorship of<br />\nthis protest when Mr. Tetlaff<br />\nremoved the _dummy\u2014isn't it clear<br /><br />\nand for the rest of the class of 74,<br />\nmeans at Homewood.<br />\nthere was a realization that we too,<br />\nBut this year was a little<br />\nin<br />\na way, had begun our last season<br />\ndifferent, too.

Why<br />\ndo you want to be a Young<br />\nTrustee?<br />\nKathleen Hunt: I think<br />\nprobably listing qualifications<br />\nsuch as activities and that sort of<br />\nthing in the undergraduate school<br />\nis somewhat unrealistic. I think<br />\nbeing a graduate of the<br />\nUniversity is probably the<br />\nprimary qualification that can all<br />\nlist. I have lived in the<br />\ndormitories for three years, two<br />\nas' housemaster, and have had<br />\nclose contact with the<br />\nundergraduates and the various<br />\ngroups of them without<br />\ncommitting myself to a particular<br />\nfaction of the University. I<br />\ngained a lot of experience that<br />\nway in the needs of students,<br />\nhow they're being met the the<br />\nschool and how they perceive<br />\ntheir needs to be met in the<br />\nfuture. I would like therefore to<br />\ncontribute to the Trustees this<br />\nexperience and these perceptions<br />\nthat I have found over my three<br />\nyears here. As a person having<br />\ngone through the transition of<br />\ncoeducation at the University,<br />\nand being a woman in that<br />\ntransition, I think that I have a<br />\nlot to offer in terms of a<br />\nstudent's view and a view of<br />\nvarious sectors of the<br />\nundergraduate community.<br />\nRobert Gray: I feel that my<br />\nstrongest qualifications to<br />\nbecome a Trustee is my desire to<br />\nbecome a trustee and my<br />\nperception of myself that I will<br />\nwork well within such a body<br />\nand as a representative of the<br />\nentire University as a Trustee.<br />\nWhile we are elected by the<br />\nundergraduates of the campus, I<br />\nfeel that the YT would be a<br />\ndoing a disservice both to the<br />\nBoard of Trustees and to the<br />\nHomewood campus in that we<br />\nwould be representative of the<br />\nHomewood campus per se. We<br />\nare YT of the University's five<br />\ncampuses. I feel that with this in<br />\nmind, a person should go into the<br />\nTrustees open and willing to<br />\nwork and be able to work in such<br />\na group, and this is why I feel I<br />\nam suited to become a Young<br />\nTrustee. I don't think that any<br />\nparticular faction o-n the'<br />\nHomewood campus should be<br />\nrepresented. I ,feel that this is a<br />\nUniversity-wide thing, and not<br />\njust Homewood campus. This is<br />\nbasically why I feel that you<br />\nmust be open and must be<br />\ncompletely honest and be willing<br />\nto work with a large body of<br />\npeople\u2014of men I should say,<br />\nbecause there are no women on<br />\nthe board, it's say to say. I feel<br />\nthat we must be open and above<br />\nboard with them to be able to<br />\naccomplish anything at this<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nDaniel McDonald: I feel my<br />\nmajor qualification for the Board<br />\nof Trustees, as far as University<br />\nactivities go, is the job that I've<br />\nhad the last two years as student<br />\ncustodian and dormitory<br />\nassistant manager, which has<br />\nbeen a position of great trust. I<br />\nthink you can ask almost any of<br />\nthe girls in the dorms how<br />\ntrusting they have to be of us.<br /><br />\nThere's another qualification that<br />\nI feel is very important to any<br />\nposition a person cares to take<br />\non, and that concerns<br />\nmotivation. Frankly, I'm very<br />\nskeptical of people who would<br />\nsay \"I want to be a Board of<br />\nTrustees member because this<br />\nUniversity has done great things<br />\nfor me and I'd like to pay them<br />\nback. Although this is true in my<br />\ncase that I feel this way. if that<br />\nwere to be my only motivation<br />\nfor becoming a Board of Trustee<br />\nmember, I would not be running.<br />\nI do consider my main<br />\nmotivation for running for the<br />\nBoard of Trustees as purely<br />\nselfish. That is, I feel as though I<br />\nwish to be a part of the<br />\nUniversity as far as a constructive<br />\npart, and that would give me<br />\nsatisfaction. It is this satisfaction<br />\nwhich I think is the proper<br />\nmotivation for doing anything<br />\nthat a person does.<br />\nChuck Slonim: I think first<br />\nof all that my strong points<br />\nwould be my activities that I<br />\nhave engaged in while at school.<br />\nI've been in almost every<br />\ndepartment of this school, from<br />\nAdmissions to athletics to<br />\nStudent Union to Student<br />\nCouncil, working with applicants<br /><br />\non Blue Key, and all in all, just<br />\nabout every department. I've<br />\nseen how they work and I've<br />\nbecome involved with in the<br />\nworking of the University, and I<br />\nfeel that my experience would<br />\nhelp me out as far as looking<br />\nahead as to what the school<br />\nneeds in different departments.<br />\nI've seen some pitfalls, some<br />\nstrong points, but as a -Board<br />\nmember I think that I can initiate<br />\nsoem of my ideas or at least<br />\nmake them known knowing the<br />\nfeelings of the students because<br />\nI've worked with quite a majority<br />\nof the students at this school. I<br />\nthink my strong point is that I<br />\ncan relate what I know from our<br />\nexperiences, meaning mine along<br />\nwith other students, to be able to<br />\nhelp everybody -involved not<br />\nreally leaving one person out of<br />\nit. I think I have enough<br />\nknowledge of the differnt types<br />\nof people on this campus to use<br />\nthat knowledge towards making<br />\none idea stretch a long way. in<br />\nterms of everybody so that<br />\neverybody's satisfied, not just<br />\none group or another group. I<br />\nthink I have a knowledge of the<br />\npeople on campus, just from my<br />\nwork with them.<br />\nThe only thing I really know<br />\nabout Young Trustees is what<br />\nmost boards of trustees are, that<br />\nis, overseeing organization that is<br />\nthe voting body for much of the<br />\nlegislation that goes on in the<br />\nschool, or in any organization for<br />\nthat matter. Of course, I've never<br />\nparticipated on a Board of<br />\nTrustees. I can only look to see<br />\nthat I think that I can do a good<br />\njob carrying out whatever the<br />\nresponsibilities. I know I've tried<br />\nto look into it, I've asked over at<br />\nHomewood House 'What does<br />\nthe Board of Trustees do' and it's<br />\nkind of a vague answer, you<br />\nknow, \"you're one of the Board<br />\nof Trustees.\" But then when you<br />\nsay what does the Board of<br />\nTrustees do, then you just<br />\nactually have to go to a<br />\ndictionary and find out, well,<br />\nBoard of Trustees is..<br />\nI don't plan on promising<br />\nanything, I just plan to be an<br />\nactive member and a<br />\nhard-working member of the<br />\nBoard. If I find something that I<br />\nthink needs initiating by just an<br />\nidea before the Board. then I'll<br />\ndefinitely get a say at what I feel<br />\nI can't make any promises becaue<br />\nI don't know what'll be like until<br />\nI actually get into and see what<br />\npowers I can actually muster up<br /><br />\nChuck Slonim<br />\ncampaign. I would also like to see require much money which I<br />\nbuilding on campus. To put it don't know is available or not. I<br />\nanother way I'd like to see the don't know how feasible these<br />\nrational construction of new ideas are, but I would like to see<br />\nfacillities on campus, with point something done along these lines,<br />\nin mind the new Biology whereever possible.<br />\nMcDonald: I consider the<br />\nbuilding. I would like to see<br />\npurpose<br />\nof the Board two-fold;<br />\ncooperation between the entire<br />\none<br />\nis<br />\npretty<br />\nmuch a financial<br />\ncommunity<br />\nUniversity and the<br />\nwhich surrounds it. Hopkins caretaking part of the University.<br />\ncannot isolate itself from its That involves making sure the<br />\nmoney goes hwere it's meant to<br />\nsurrounding areas and I think<br />\nthat the Board of Trustees being go, as effeciently as possible, to<br />\nthe emminent collection of where it would do the most<br />\ngood. Now a lot of the decisions<br />\npeople that they are, should<br />\nof where the money would do<br />\ndevote some of their time to<br />\nsoothing community relations .the most,good is not really part<br />\nof the Board of Trustees' duty<br />\nwith the University, particularly<br />\naround the Homewood campus. I and that's up to the academic<br />\nparts of the Univesity, and also<br />\nwould also like to see<br />\ninvesticated the possibility of to the Studnet Affairs part in<br />\ndeveloping further which the Board has no<br />\ncommunications between various jurisdiction. Along the money<br />\ncampuses on school. There have lines, take an illustiation\u2014in<br />\nprevious years, I would have been<br />\nbeen various instances called to<br />\nvery much for the University<br />\nmy attention this year where lack<br />\nbuilding a new dormitory in<br />\nof communication has had dire<br />\nwhich<br />\nall the students could live<br />\neffects to the students,<br />\nand possible reduce the critical<br />\nparticularly between the Med<br />\nmass of students needed in order<br />\nSchool and the Homewood<br />\nto have an active campus life.<br />\ncampus undergraduates.
