The latter represents an attempt to familiarize<br />\nsuburban Baltimoreans with the problems of the<br />\ninner-city and the ghetto black.<br />\nThe AWARE program concentrates its efforts on<br />\narranging speaking engagements before various Baltimore<br />\ncommunity organizations. If the drug information<br />\nprogram follows the lead of AWARE, similar speaking<br />\nengagements will probably be scheduled.<br />\nIn such an engagement, the community group is<br />\naddressed briefly by a student from the Hopkins<br />\norganization, and the floor is then opened to questions.<br />\nFrom all reports, the speakers from Hopkins have been<br />\nwell received.<br />\nAccording to Martin Hickey, Chairman of the new<br />\nS.A. program, the basic approach has not yet been<br />\ndetermined. At tomorrow's Steering Committee<br />\n<br />\nmeeting, three possible alternatives will be examined.<br />\nFirst, the speakeri from the organization might<br />\napproach the problem by comparing the effects of<br />\nmarijuana and other illicit drugs to those of alcohol. By<br />\nplacing these illegal drugs, about which there is a critical<br />\ndearth of knowledge, next to a familiar substance such<br />\nas alcohol, it is felt that many of the audience's<br />\nmisconceptions and distortions of fact might be<br />\neliminated.<br />\nThe second alternative which will be considered is<br />\nproviding the groups with a straight, factual account<br />\nregarding what is known about the effects of marijuana<br />\nand other drugs.<br />\nAgitation for Legislation<br />\nFinally, the group will consider a suggestion that it<br />\ndiscuss the current legislation pertaining to drug abuse.<br />\nAfter the suburban groups have been acquainted with<br />\nthe present status of these drugs under the law and the<br />\npenalties which accrue to users of these drugs, it has<br />\nbeen suggested that the speakers present a case for<br />\nmodification of the drug laws, and for rendering the<br />\npenalties for possession and use of the drugs more<br />\nrealistic. Only in this way, it is argued, can enough<br />\nsupport be mobilized for a change in the drug laws.<br />\nHickey's prediction is that the approach which is<br />\nfinally agreed upon will contain elements of all three<br />\nproposals. To bolster the program, he hopes to assemble<br />\na panel of physicians and lawyers, to assist in discussions<br />\non drugs and to render the presentations more effective.<br />\n<br />\n/CAMPUS NOTES\\ JHU Receives Grant<br />\nMARYLAND LACROSSE<br />\nWJHU, 830 kc, will transmit live<br />\nthe Lacrosse game between Hopkins and<br />\nU. of Maryland tomorrow.

The goal<br />\nis for the University and the community<br />\ntogether to match the money given by<br />\nthe Ford Foundation. However, after an<br />\ninitial response of $125,000 by the<br />\ncommunity, Dr. Gordon admitted that<br />\nfund raising had been slower than<br />\nexpected. He said that this was<br />\nunderstandable, since it would be only<br />\nlogical to assume that before giving<br />\nmoney the community would want to<br />\nsee \"what they were buying.\"<br />\nDr. Sol Levine, currently professor<br />\nad Chairman of the Department of<br />\nBehavioral Sciences at the University's<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health,<br />\nwas appointed head of the center.<br />\nThree-Fold Purpose<br />\nThe purposes of the center,<br />\naccording to Dr. Levine, are three-fold:<br />\neducation,research, and consultation. He<br />\nstressed that the center would not,<br />\nunder any circumstances, administer<br />\nservice programs, such as welfare. Dr.<br />\nLevine does not see the center becoming<br />\nan \"ivory tower\" with no relevance to<br />\nthe community.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Levine, \"This<br />\ncenter is the first place where a real<br />\ndiscussion on urban problems can be<br />\nheld, and where the desperate need of<br />\nthe Baltimore city government for<br />\nexpert information, including all<br />\npossible implications of any proposed<br />\nproject can be obtained. It will also<br />\nprovide students and others an<br />\nopportunity to learn and attempt to<br />\ngain an understanding about urban<br />\nproblems. By performing these services<br />\nwe are playing an active role in the<br />\ncommunity, leaving the city government<br />\nas the implementer of any forthcoming<br />\nprojects.\"<br />\nThe center will have three<br />\ndifferent committees helping to guide its<br />\nactions. The Policy Board, composed of<br />\nUniversty officials, will decide major<br />\npolicy. A nine-member Citizen's<br />\nAdvisory Board will provide \"a vital link<br />\nbetween the community and the<br />\ncenter,\" according to Levine.

All three men noted that there are only ten<br />\nprofessors in the English Department and most of them<br />\nare heavily committed to the 40 graduate students in the<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nAll three men also pointed out that the<br />\nundergraduate interest in English has increased greatly<br />\nduring the past few years. Dr. Allen said that he used to<br />\nexpect no more than 15-20 students in his classes, but<br />\n<br />\nnow he often has 75 students in his Shakespeare classes.<br />\nDr. Hancher made this same point when he said that the<br />\ndepartment has to \"serve many more than its own<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nDr. Paulson listed several reasons for the acute<br />\nshortage of courses next semester. First,the department<br />\nhas been unable to find a replacement for Dr. Anderson<br />\nwho began teaching at Hopkins last fall. Second, the<br />\nadministration offered the department another assistant<br />\nprofessor, but it was too late to attract the kind of<br />\nquality professor that Hopkins demands. Finally, two<br />\nprofessors will be taking sabaticals next year for at least<br />\na semester.<br />\nImprovements Expected<br />\nDr. Paulson concluded that a number of<br />\nunfortunate circumstances all came together at the same<br />\ntime to cause next year's situation. He said that there are<br />\nsure to be some improvements in the undergraduate<br />\nofferings the year after next.<br />\nAll three English professors felt that the<br />\ndepartment was understaffed to meet the present<br />\ndemands of the undergraduate student body. Dr.<br />\nPaulson and Dr. Allen emphasized that the department<br />\n<br />\nhad to serve its graduate students first. Dr. Paulson said<br />\nthat the addition of at least one new professor in 1970<br />\nin addition to the replacement for Dr. Anderson would<br />\nbe some help. He also said that the department would<br />\nhave to make some effort to give more preference to<br />\nundergraduates even if this meant a minor slighting of<br />\nthe graduates.

He said that the English<br />\nprofessors regretted the situation but that they didn't<br />\nseem to have a concrete program for remedying the<br />\nsituation.<br />\nHe said the fact that four senior professors in<br />\nthe Department, Howard, Paulson, Wasserman and Miller<br />\nwere teaching no courses at all next year for<br />\nundergraduates showed \"a negligence in concern for the<br />\nundergraduates.\" He said that he regarded the problem<br />\nas a very serious situation which would have to be<br />\nimproved in the future.<br />\n<br />\nGordon Calls Undergraduate Body\"A Good Thing\"<br />\nBy EMIL PAVLOVICS<br />\nDr. Lincoln Gordon, at a<br />\nThursday panel discussion on \"Student<br />\nPower\" stated that he did not believe<br />\nstudents should have a direct voice in<br />\nformulating academic policy.<br />\nMr. Robert Bilgrave, director of<br />\nStudent Affairs, John Guess, President<br />\nof the Student Council and Gordon<br />\nwere the primary speakers at the meeting sponsored by a subcommittee<br />\nof the Student Council, the Academic<br />\nAffairs Committee.<br />\nThe three principal speakers<br />\ndelivered short opening remarks, then<br />\nfielded questions from the audience of<br />\napproximately 100 students.<br />\nPresident Gordon did not have the<br />\ntime to finalize his remarks, having just<br />\ncome from a meeting which took the<br />\nentire morning. Instead, he spoke from<br />\nnotes he had \"jotted down.\" The major<br />\ncontention which he hoped to<br />\nemphasize was that in a modern<br />\nuniversity, there neither is nor should<br />\nthere be \"a single decision-maker.\"<br />\nGordon felt that \"an<br />\nundergraduate body is a good thing for<br />\n<br />\na university.\" He was \"gratified\" that<br />\nstudents were seeking an active voice<br />\nwithin the University, and felt that<br />\nundergraduates were partners in the<br />\nUniversity \"junior partners to be sure,\"<br />\nbut partners nonetheless.<br />\nHe went on to speak of the<br />\nvarious categories of decisions within<br />\nthe University, explaining that for<br />\ncertain questions,.such as faculty hirings<br />\nand promotions, undergraduate<br />\ndecision-making really has no place.<br />\nThough he felt that long term planning<br />\nwas mainly a faculty and administrative<br />\nprocess, since they \"do have more of a<br />\nlong term stake in the University,\" the<br />\nPresident cited the \"arrangements made<br />\nthis year for student input.\" In student<br />\nextracurriculars, he pointed out that<br />\n\"most of the power lies in student<br />\nrepresentatives.\"<br />\nGordon explained that the best<br />\nmethod for true student representation<br />\nlies in the development of an<br />\nundergraduate voting system, truly<br />\nresponsive to the students, coordinated<br />\nwith the current committee machinery.<br />\nHe ended his opening remarks<br />\nwith the declaration that \"We have no<br />\nclosed doors.\"<br />\n(Continued on Page 12)<br />\n<br />\nwhere Bilgrave announced his<br />\nDr. Gordon and Robert Bilgrave at the \"Student Power\" discussion,<br />\nintention \"to speak in broad generalities\" and proceeded to do so.<br />\n<br />\nSwanson Claims \"Confusion\" With Gordon Over NUC Letter<br />\nDr.Carl Swanson, the associate dean of the<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences, stated this week<br />\nthat there had been \"confusion\" between his<br />\nOffice and the office of the president in regard<br />\nto the nature of his reply to the April 28 New<br />\nUniversity Conference letter sent to President<br />\nGordon.<br />\nDr. Gordon has repeatedly maintained that he<br />\nforwarded the NUC letter concerning the status ofROTC<br />\nto Dean Swanson for an \"official\" administration reply.<br />\nGordon told the News-Letter in an interview last<br />\nWednesday that \"The SDS letter had no signatures or<br />\nPost office box, no way of replying to it. The other<br />\nletter did get an official word back by Dean Swanson<br />\nWho was speaking in my name.\"<br />\nAlthough refusing to criticize Gordon's method of<br />\ninterstaff communications, Swanson stated that he never,<br />\nknew that his letter would be construed as the \"official<br />\n<br />\nword\" of the President. \"President Gordon asked Dean<br />\nKimball to ask me to reply to Dr. Pepper on the status<br />\nof ROTC. The letter I wrote was just informational,<br />\nsaying that the subject of ROTC was the next item<br />\nbefore the Committee on Student Relations...I thought I<br />\nwas just to make an informational reply.\"<br />\nThe April 28 letter to the president from the New<br />\nUniversity Conference said, after listing the NUC's<br />\ndemands on the Hopkins ROTC program, \"We would<br />\nlike to hear your comments to these demands on Friday,<br />\nMat 2, at a teach-in on Keyser Quadrangle at 2 p.m. We<br />\nrequest your formal answer to the above demands at or<br />\nbefore the 2:30 rally on Tuesday, May 6.\" Three names<br />\nwere listed to address the replies, including Dr. Pepper's.<br />\n\"My reaction at the time (to Swanson's reply) was<br />\nthat it was totally irrelevant,\" Pepper explained. \"The<br />\nanswer that came back was as if we questioned the past<br />\nhistory and academic status of ROTC at Hopkins.

The resolution of the<br />\nLevering Hall financial crisis proved this, he maintained.<br />\n\"I think that without that petition campaign, I<br />\nprobably would not have agreed to find these extra<br />\nresources in terms of the budget. I consider a petition<br />\ncampaign a splendid way of showing 'student 'support.\"<br />\nManipulations<br />\nThe New University Conference criticized the<br />\nproponents of a policy of\" using all available channels<br />\nof communication before raising the issue in public\" in a<br />\n\"Dear Colleague\" letter distributed this week. Dr.<br />\nPepper said that if \"the University continues to behave<br />\nin this very manipulative way,\" the NUC will continue<br />\ntheir \"improper procedures.\"<br />\nAn example of manipulation, Pepper stated, was<br />\nthe hearings the Committee of Student Relations held<br />\nthis week on the pros and cons of the ROTC issue. \"We<br />\nfind it exceptional that prior to an all-university<br />\nconvocation, this committee has set up a meeting to air<br />\nthe ROTC issue, and has set up straw polls.

The APL has recently been<br />\ncalled into question by the Johns Hopkins<br />\nChapter of the American Association of<br />\nUniversity Professors.<br />\nIn an unprecedented move, the Council passed a<br />\n\"general outline\" of its feelings which will serve as its<br />\nbasic philosophy for the coming academic year.<br />\nDeplorable Over-Reaction<br />\nThe resolution on the Homewood House<br />\nanti-ROTC demonstration stated that the SC \"Deplored<br />\nthe Administration's over-reaction and threat of<br />\n'suspension and appropriate action.' \"It continued in a<br />\ndifferent vein, holding that the SC hoped that \"in the<br />\nfuture, fellow students will refrain from unnecessary<br />\nconfrontations which, through their frequency, may lose<br />\ntheir effectiveness.\" The resolution was proposed by<br />\nManuel Rodriguez and passed by an 11-3 vote. In order<br />\nto follow up on the incident, an informal committee was<br />\norganized to investigate the events of May 6.<br />\nTwo years ago, the Hopkins chapter of the<br />\nAmerican Association of University Professors (AAUP)<br />\nappointed a Committee on Classified Research<br />\ncomprised of Drs. Barker, Rourke, Pevsner, and<br />\nHamburger. After a year of extensive study, the<br />\nCommittee issued a report containing these resolutions<br />\n(with Dr. Hamburger, Director of Barton Hall and<br />\nChairman of Electrical Engineering, dissenting). The<br />\nreport was presented to the AAUP in the hope that the<br />\nChapter would adopt the resolutions and submit them to<br />\nthe administration and Trustees of the University.<br />\nThe resolutions stated \"First, classified research,<br />\nand government security clearance, and serving the<br />\n<br />\narsenal function of government, are inappropriate<br />\noperations by the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\n\"Secondly, that the six continuing contracts<br />\nshould be terminated with deliberate speed, at the<br />\nearliest moment the contracts permit if possible, and in<br />\nany case not later than the minimum time needed to<br />\ntransfer personnel and equipment to unclassified work,<br />\nor to make other just arrangements.<br />\n\"Third, that these resolutions be transmitted by<br />\nthe President of the Chapter to the President and<br />\nTrustee's of the University.\"<br />\nAPL Special<br />\nAccording to Dr. Pevsner, the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory was not considered one of the six contracts<br />\nreferred to in the second resolution.

Though<br />\ndifficult it would be a grand achievement for Hopkins to<br />\nput that operation on a non-military footing.(b)On the<br />\nother hand the laboratory is 25 miles from Homewood,<br />\nand, again with the exception of Evening College work,<br />\nit is thoroughly separate from other Hopkins operations<br />\nin Physics and Engineering. This seems to raise a<br />\nquestion....whether or not the APL can properly remain<br />\na branch of the University.\"<br />\nThe Student Council, in response to the AAUP<br />\ncommittee's impressions on the APL,sent a letter to Dr.<br />\nGordon which asked him to join with them and<br />\nmembers of the AAUP in an administration- studentfaculty commission to decide whether it would be<br />\nfeasible to convert the APL to non-military research<br />\nwithin a reasonable time period,or whether the<br />\nUniversity should disassociate itself from the APL.<br />\nThe SC resolved unanimously that the commission<br />\nshould report publically no later than December 1,<br />\n1969.

Once violence occurs,<br />\nhowever, the Federal Government will<br />\nstep in. \"The university is not an<br />\nextraterritorial community, and its<br />\nofficials have the obligation to protect<br />\nthe rights of the peaceful students on its<br />\ncampus by use of the established local<br />\nlaw enforcement agencies and courts.\"<br />\n<br />\nPresident Nixon plans to bring the power of the federal government into the struggle to preserve<br />\n\"law'n'order\" on college campuses. In this scene which occurred at C.C.N.Y., local police seem to<br />\nbe having no difficulty handling the situation.<br />\n<br />\nCollege administrators have<br />\nreacted less than enthusiastically to<br />\nPresident Nixon's decision to bring the<br />\ninfluence of the federal government into<br />\nplay in an effort to end campus<br />\nviolence.<br />\nHarvard President Nathan M.<br />\nPusey, whose school has recently been<br />\nhit by student disruption, has publicly<br />\ndisagreed with Nixon's get-tough policy.<br />\nCalling the policy \"frightening\", Dr.<br />\nPusey said that \"the answer has to come<br />\nfrom within the university itself.\"<br />\nHe did, however, defend his use of<br />\npolice to clear demonstrators from<br />\nUniversity Hall in the recent trouble at<br />\nHarvard.

Mandel's Drug Law Called Unconstitutional<br />\n\"There are some serious constitutional questions<br />\nabout the 'Comprehensive Drug Abuse Control and<br />\nRehabilitation Act',\" stated Marvin Braiterman, former<br />\nchairman of the Maryland chapter of the American Civil<br />\nLiberies Union.<br />\nBraiterman contended that the new law \"may<br />\nviolate the due process and equal protection provisions\"<br />\nof the state and federal constitutions. Specifically: the<br />\ninclusion of marijuana users among drug addicts, the<br />\nprocedure by which a person is \"charged\", and<br />\nprovisions for incarcerating non-criminals with a rarely<br />\ncured illness, were suspected of being illegal.<br />\nSigned into law late last month by Governor<br />\nMarvin Mandel, the statute provides for the incarceration<br />\nof drug addicts for \"unspecified periods\" up to seven<br />\nyears. An addict is defined as one who \"exhibits the<br />\nsymptoms of physical and psychological dependence\"<br />\non any illegal drug.<br />\nIncarceration<br />\n\"Under the state of medical knowledge today,\"<br />\nexplained Braiterman, who headed the Maryland Civil<br />\nLiberties Union from 1965 through 1968,\"the fact that<br />\nthe provisions of the act could reach marijuana users<br />\nmakes it suspect. In addition, the state impliedly<br />\npromises large scale efforts at rehabilitation of drug<br />\naddicts as thequid pro quo for incarceration, even<br />\nthough such incarceration doesn't have to be preceded<br />\nby any kind of criminal offense.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, everything we know about treatment of<br />\ndrug addicts\u2014especially those hard core addicts who are<br />\ninvolved in the crime problem\u2014indicated that treatment<br />\nis usually unsuccessful. The statute can't make drug<br />\naddiction a crime as such, so it treats it as a medical<br />\nproblem\u2014which it is. But how can it allow involuntary<br />\nimprisonment for an illness which is in many respects<br />\nnot able to be treated successfully.<br />\n\"Then there are many procedural questions that<br />\nare raised in the act. The whole business of how a person<br />\nbecomes 'charged' under the act\u2014by a judge, by a<br />\nmember of his family, or practically by anyone...Once a<br />\nperson is adjudged a drug addict and comes under the<br />\nclutches of this legislation, he is in real trouble, and will<br />\nstay in trouble for years.<br />\nMythology and Fantasy<br />\n\"Not only that, but the whole concept of a drug<br />\naddict is more tightly linked to a lot of mythology and<br />\nfantasy about drug use and abuse than to the actual state<br />\nof scientific and medical knowledge. The language of the<br />\nlaw makes a pretense of being medical, but I think that<br />\nits motivation is very punitive and political.<br />\n\"It may,\" Braiterman conjectured, \"be a grab-bag<br />\nof civil liberties transgressions. Yet, if it appeared that<br />\nthe law proceeded from generous, humane, or social<br />\nconcern, wc might wink at the constitutional<br />\ndeficiencies involved. But it doesn't sound to me as if<br />\nthis is the overriding concern of the statute as written.<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n\"Of course, one has to remember that<br />\nbetter,<br />\nadministration of such programs is sometimes<br />\nthe<br />\nmore humane, and more successful than the spirit of if<br />\nand<br />\nnot<br />\nlegislation would indicate. But sometimes it is<br />\nthe<br />\nthat is the case here, this act won't really help solvedrug<br />\nin<br />\ninvolved<br />\nsocial, medical, and human tragedies<br />\naddiction and dependence, but will exacerbate them.<br />\n\"As a matter of fact,\" concluded Braiterman, \"the<br />\nwhole problem of drugs and drug abuse may very Well<br />\nsuffer from laws being too numerous and wisdom being<br />\nin short supply. In that respect, the statute reads to me<br />\nlike another of the numerous laws on drugs that adds<br />\nlittle to the wisdom that we need to deal with this<br />\nproblem.\"<br />\nAccording to the act's authors, the Drug Abuse<br />\nAct is based on the premise that \"not only crime, but<br />\nunemployment, poverty, loss of human dignity, and of<br />\nthe ability to fill a meaningful and productive role in the<br />\ncommunity, as well as damage to the physical and<br />\nmental health of the addict himself are all by-products<br />\nof this spreading disease.\"<br />\nGovernor Marvin Mandel signed the bill into law<br />\njust three weeks before a blue-ribbon gubernatorial<br />\ncommission on drugs was due to release its findings.<br />\nMandel had pointed to the upcoming report (due May<br />\n22) in his response to recent statewide pleas that he look<br />\ninto drug law reform.<br />\n<br />\n!Department of Defense Breaks Grape Strike]<br />\nBy STUART SEIDEL<br />\nIn 1969, the Department of<br />\nDefense increased purchases of<br />\nCalifornia table grapes eight- hundred<br />\npercent, thus effectively offsetting the<br />\naccomplishments of the United Farm<br />\nWorkers strike against central California<br />\ngrape-growers.<br />\nThe strike had shown definite<br />\nprogress in its three and a half year<br />\nexistence, according to Andy Immutart,<br />\na Vice President of the AFL-CIO United<br />\nFarm Workers. lmmutan said that the<br />\nnumber of grapes purchased nationwide<br />\nhad decreased by 20% before the<br />\nDepartment of Defense increased its<br />\npurchases.<br />\nThe strike centered in the town of<br />\nDelano, California, 200 miles north of<br />\nLos Angeles. The average income of a<br />\ngrape worker in Delano is $2,024,<br />\n$1476 below the national \"poverty<br />\nline.\" Area growers claim that by<br />\nproviding housing for the workers, they<br />\nmiligate many of the workers' financial<br />\ndi fficul ties.<br />\nThe strike was organized by<br />\nMexican-American amd Filipino grape<br />\npickers in 1965, in order to gain<br />\nrecognition of rights accorded them by<br />\nfederal law. The main issue then and<br />\nnow is the right to collective<br />\n<br />\nbargaining. SES and SNCC originally<br />\nworked in conjunction with the union<br />\nbut discontinued their work due to<br />\ndisparities between union aims and<br />\nradical concerns.<br />\nIn mid-1966 the union joined the<br />\nAFL-CIO as the United Farm Workers<br />\nOrganizing Committee (UFWOC), in an<br />\neffort to gain support from a strong<br />\nnational organization while retaining a<br />\ndegree of autonomy. The strategy was<br />\nnot succesful, however, since the parent<br />\nunion had to support certain liberal<br />\npoliticians, such as Pat Brown, who<br />\nbacked the growers. Recently the<br />\nOrganizing Committee has drawn<br />\npoliticians with ties to labor as well as<br />\nradicals throughout the nation.<br />\nThe initial strike was called<br />\nagainst wine grape growers and was<br />\nsettled, to a large extent, by 1967, when<br />\nan attack was launched against the<br />\nHuimarra Vineyards Corporation, the<br />\nworld'sp largest producer of table<br />\ngrapes. The company was immediately<br />\nable to replace the strikers with \"scab\"<br />\nlaborers from Mexico, who entered<br />\nCalifornia on temporary visas.<br />\nGrowers React<br />\nIn august, 1967, the union called<br />\nfor a nationwide boycott of Guimarra's<br />\n<br />\nproducts. The boycott spread to include<br />\nall California grapes when Guimarra<br />\nbegan to ship its products under the<br />\nlabels of cooperating growers from<br />\nother parts of the state. The growers<br />\ncountered by labelling their products<br />\n\"Arizona grapes\" and thus the boycott<br />\nwas expanded to encompass all grapes<br />\nproduced in the United States.<br />\nLast year the growers lost ten to<br />\ntwenty per cent of their sales because of<br />\nthe boycott, but their profits were not<br />\nseriously affected. In an attempt to<br />\ndestroy the union, the growers started a<br />\n\"front\" union that opposed Chavez and<br />\nthe UFWOC. The formation of such<br />\nunions is against -a federal law that<br />\nprohibits employers from organizing<br />\nemployees. The attempt was exposed to<br />\nthe Labor Department in March by two<br />\nformer leaders of the \"front\" union.<br />\nThey told the Department \"We were to<br />\ntell workers not to be afraid of Chavez,<br />\nto be united, and we as an organization<br />\nwould support and protect workers We<br />\nwere to oppose UFWOC attempts to<br />\norganized<br />\nLarge chain stores have not been<br />\nreceptive to the grape boycott. Members<br />\nof the boards of directors of many chain<br />\nsupermarkets also have interest in the<br />\ngrape growing business, and therefore<br />\n<br />\nare reluctant to submit to consumer<br />\npressure.<br />\nFederal law prohibits a secondarY<br />\nstrike against transporting scab grapes.<br />\nTherefore, fellow members of the<br />\nAFL-CIO cannot support the boycott..<br />\nFederal immigration policy also has<br />\npermitted widespread importation of<br />\nMexican labor to prevent a crisis among<br />\nthe growers. Chavez charges that these<br />\nimmigrants come \"in buses provided bY<br />\ngrowers and escorted by local<br />\npolice.\"<br />\nConflicto de Labor\"<br />\nThe law does require employers to<br />\ninform the Mexicans that they will h,e<br />\nbreaking a strike, but this is<br />\ncircumvented by telling them of 3<br />\n\"c onflicto de labor\" rather than<br />\n\"huelga\"(strike).<br />\nThe California Department of<br />\nLabor hinders the strike by referring<br />\nworkers seeking employment to fields<br />\nthat have been struck. The California<br />\neducational system also supports the<br />\ngrowers by purchasing grapes for the<br />\nfood services in the state's colleges. Oil<br />\nall state campuses in California except<br />\nthe University of California at BerkeleY<br />\nthe grapes are served. Various members<br />\nof the California Board of Regents have<br />\nbusiness in the grape growing industry.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Uses Quasi-Endowments to Balance Budget<br />\nPresident Gordon said in a meeting with<br />\nstudents- on Tuesday that the Arts and Sciences<br />\n-division of the University had to borrow into<br />\n$2.6 million of Hopkins quasi-endowment fund<br />\nto balance the 1968-69 budget terminating on<br />\nJune 31.<br />\nThe University's fund, presently including<br />\nendowments legally forbidden for budgetary<br />\npurposes,totals $56 million, the President estimated. The<br />\n$2.6 million transfer was the first time such funds were<br />\nused to balance Hopkins budget in the memory of many<br />\nadministrators. Dean Allyn Kimball partially attributed<br />\nthis year's deficit to- the research cutbacks to universities<br />\non the Federal level.<br />\nHopkins Is Tenth<br />\nGordon<br />\nsaid<br />\nthe \"greatest budged increases<br />\nDr.<br />\nwere in faculty salaries\" this year. The American<br />\nAssociation of University Professors placed Hopkins<br />\ntenth in the 1968-69 fiscal year in salaries and fringe<br />\nbenefits of American colleges and universities.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins was ninth last year in this<br />\ncategory, Gordon claimed, \"substantial improvements in<br />\n'salaries and other budgetary items\" were made this fiscal<br />\nyear. He estimated that there would be a 9 per cent<br />\nincrement in faculty compensations in the 1969-70<br />\nbudget in its final stages of completion.<br />\nThe A.A.U.P. cited Harvard, California Institute<br />\nof Technology, University of Chicago and City College<br />\nof New York as,the top-paying institutions in decending<br />\n<br />\norder. Hopkins' salaries roughly equate to those of Yale<br />\nand Cornell. SAIS pays the highest faculty salaries .on<br />\n.<br />\nthe average of the University's divisions\u2014<br />\nHopkins' overall budget increased from $22 million<br />\nin 1959 to $66 million in 1968. The greatest source for<br />\nthe expanded budget was the government. Payments<br />\nfrbm Washington increased from $10 million to $40<br />\nmillion over this time period. Private grants, private gifts<br />\nand endowments have remained constant over this<br />\nperiod. Revenues gained through tuition have expanded<br />\nfrom $4 million from 1959-1968. Tuitions, though, have<br />\nremained the same in their percentage of the budget's<br />\nrevenue.<br />\nResearch Increase<br />\nNaturally, the great increase over the years in<br />\nexpenditures has been in sponsored research and<br />\ntraining. Such research has jumped from $10-$35 million<br />\nin 9 years. Student Aid has decreased in this time period<br />\nin a percentage of the budget. Hopkins' 1967-68 budget,<br />\nthe latest year it has presently been tabulated, totaled<br />\n$67.1 million, excluding the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory. This was a $6.5 million increase over the<br />\nprevious year.<br />\nExpenditures in the Arts and Science division of<br />\nthe University increased from S10 million to $26 million<br />\nin the nine-year period. The greatest divisional boosts<br />\nwere in Medicine. The government comprised 43 per<br />\ncent of the sources of revenue in the 1968-68 Arts and<br />\nScience budget, with tuition totaling 32 per cent of the<br />\nrevenue source.<br />\n<br />\nARTS AND SCIENCES<br />\n$ 25,822,810<br />\n<br />\nPRIVATE<br />\nGIFTS<br />\n10%<br />\nENDOW.<br />\n5%<br />\nGOVERNMENT<br />\n43%<br />\n<br />\nTUITION<br />\n32%<br />\nAUX.<br />\nENT.<br />\n8%<br />\n<br />\nOTHER 2%<br />\nIncreases in the Arts and Sciences 1968-69 budget shown a<br />\nreflect greatly expanded government expenditures for rese3rc,00<br />\nHopkins, while other University resources have \u00b0els<br />\ncomparatively dried up or maintained their level.

Phillips of the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment is investigating suicide in order to<br />\ntest Durkheim's hypothesis that suicide is an<br />\nindex of social disorganization.<br />\nIf Durkheim's theory is correct, Phillips<br />\nstated, \"Campuses which have less concensus, for<br />\nexample, those marked by riots, would be<br />\nexpected to have higher suicide rates. The Ivy<br />\nLeague schools, Berkeley, Oxford, and<br />\nCambridge, would be expected to have a higher<br />\nsuicide rate than more tranquil campuses.\"<br />\nDurkheim explains the high suicide rate<br />\namong doctors in general and psychiatrists,<br />\nespecially because \"they are unusually liberal and<br />\naccept a smaller proportion of the current beliefs<br />\nin society.::<br />\nReflects Disorder<br />\nIn general, Durkheim says that a high<br />\nsuicide rate connotes an individualistic society<br />\nWith little concensus. Phillips is interested in<br />\nsuicide because \"it is a form of deviance which<br />\nreflects social disorder.\"<br />\nPhillips has been searching for quantitative<br />\nmeasures of social disorganization against which<br />\nhe can compare the suicide rate. He is currently<br />\nComparing the suicide rate to the amount of<br />\nconcensus in political policies as indicated by the<br />\nGallup Poll. If Durkheim's theory is correct, the<br />\nsuicide rate will drop during periods of great<br />\nnational unity, particularly during wartime.<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter: In what other ways do you<br />\nsee the possibility for an expansion of<br />\ntopics covered in Hopkins courses?<br />\nAmbrose: A more productive use of<br />\nHopkins' resourses could be made by<br />\nhaving graduate students teach informal<br />\nseminars on their specialties. Our<br />\ngraduate students are damn good, and<br />\nthose who arc working on dissertations<br />\nusually know more about that specific<br />\nsubject than anyone else possibly could.<br />\nWhy not make an arrangement that<br />\nwould allow them to spread that<br />\nknowledge?The undergraduates would<br />\nget young, enthusiastic teachers, while<br />\nthe graduates would get good<br />\nexperience.<br />\nNews-Letter:.In retrospect, how do you<br />\nfeel toward the time you have spent<br />\nhere?<br />\nAmbrose: I've enjoyed my five years<br />\nhere primarily because no one ever<br />\nbothered me. I did what I wanted to do,<br />\nno questions asked. Partly because the<br />\nschool is so small, partly because my<br />\nfield (military history) is distasteful to<br />\nmany academics. I have not found much<br />\nstimulation from fellow faculty<br />\nmembers, and I must say that with all<br />\nthe pre-meds and budding scientists<br />\naround I've found the general<br />\natmosphere here intellectually dead,<br />\nstifling, even flabby.

There's absolutely no excuse<br />\nfor it. The biggest reason, I suppose, is<br />\nthe teaching load here (which of course<br />\nthe faculty is going to defend); one of<br />\nstrictly minimal time amounts they are<br />\nrequired to put in teaching. The trouble<br />\nis that this makes Hopkins almost a<br />\n\"Think Tank,\" with a serious divorce<br />\nbetween the faculty and the students.<br />\nHopkins is a heaven on earth for the<br />\nfaculty, and not only in terms of<br />\nteaching load.

Rather than attempting<br />\nto delineate in detail particular grievances at this time, this resolution may be considered as<br />\na general outline of the Council's feelings. Certainly not all of the Council's actions will fit<br />\ndirectly within this framework, hut every action will inevitably be over-shadowed by these<br />\nthoughts. We urge the students at Hopkins, as well as faculty members and administrators,<br />\nto carefully consider the following:<br />\nFirst, the Council stands firmly for increased consideration for the undergraduate at<br />\nHopkins. For too long the undergraduate has been relegated by the faculty and the<br />\nadministration to an inferior position in the scale of priorities, following such goals as the<br />\npursuit of scholarly research and the improvement of graduate departments. While we do<br />\nnot question the wisdom of the University in pursuing these other goals, such efforts should<br />\nno longer unduly infringe upon attempts to better the quality of the undergraduate's<br />\nenvironment and academic opportunities. The undergraduate's demand for greater<br />\nconsideration is rendered all the more urgent by the University's historic tendency to<br />\nneglect him and by the current atmosphere, at campuses throughout the nation, of<br />\nrestlessness for change and willingness to use the tactics of confrontation and force.<br />\nSecond, in view of the University's apparent reluctance to assign a higher priority to<br />\nHopkins undergraduates, the Council feels strongly that structural changes must be made in<br />\nthe University's decision-making processes to insure the undergraduate a more effective<br />\nvoice in University policy. We do not seek power for power's sake, but rather power as a<br />\nmeans to achieve an equitable role in decisions that affect the undergraduate. To continue<br />\nto neglect reasonable student requests for consultation and fair representation would be to<br />\nignore the growing nation-wide trend in universities towards liberalization of the<br />\ndecision-making mechanisms, and would invite hostile student reactions, serving only to<br />\nfurther widen the gap between students, faculty, and administrators.<br />\nThirdly, in addition to Structural changes, the Council calls for a more open attitude<br />\non the part of faculty and administrators. Accessibility and receptiveness to student views<br />\nmust replace the closed doors and ears so characteristic of the past. The University must be<br />\nwilling to broaden the channels of communications, both formally and informally, if the<br />\naverage student is to feel an integral and respected member of the University community,<br />\nrather than an alienated pawn of the decision-makers. Better communications would serve<br />\nthe University community in two fundamental ways: by informing all parties of student<br />\nfeelings and ideas, and by bridging the gap of mis-information and suspicion between<br />\nstudents, faculty, and administrators.<br />\nFinally, the Council advocates a thorough re-examination, open to all segments of the<br />\nUniversity community, of the guiding philosophy of the University, and we feel that<br />\nUniversity policy should be made consistent with this new philosophy.<br />\nThe Student Council calls upon their fellow undergraduates to actively and<br />\nresponsibly unite behind these goals; and to the administration and to the faculty we say:<br />\nignorance of student feeling can no longer be the basis for inaction.<br />\n<br />\nSigned,<br />\nTHE STUDENT COUNCII<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\nThe Quote of the Week:<br />\n<br />\nMir<br />\n<br />\nNM\"TS<br />\n<br />\nratter<br />\n<br />\nRICHARD CRAMER.PETER HARNIK<br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nGEORGE JOHNSTON,KEVIN KRESOCK<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nSTEPHEN TULLOSS<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\n<br />\nAdolph Hitler<br />\nHamburg, Germany 1932<br />\n<br />\nDAVID HOELSCHER<br />\nNews Director<br />\n<br />\nOn a Sour Notemfarwell<br />\nThe highly touted Committee on Student Relations has been a pretty<br />\nslimy affair from the start. Many facts were brought to light by the recent<br />\nresignation of Larry Campbell, who was serving as a representative of the<br />\nundergraduate student body on the Committee. The more one learns<br />\nabout the Committee's structure and operations, the hollower ring the<br />\nwords of Dr. Gordon and Company.<br />\nMany months ago, when we students were seeking representation on<br />\nthe Academic Council, for the first time, the adminsitration sought \u2022to<br />\nallay ow fears that we weren't being heard, by forming this Committee to<br />\nadvise and report to the faculty Council. From that time forth, every<br />\ncomplaint which the students voiced about their role in policy making at<br />\nHopkins, was answered with a glowing report of this Committee's<br />\nProgress.<br />\nThe most recent example of this rosy rhetoric was found (of all<br />\nplaces) on the pages of the Baltimore Sun. Dr. Gordon wrote a letter to<br />\nthe editor, denying the charge that he is against giving students a role in<br />\nthe university's policy decisions. To heighten the effect of the denial, Dr.<br />\nGordon dusted off some of the rhetoric about our community of scholars<br />\nat Hopkins and the manner in which we are beating back the frontiers of<br />\nknowledge. The same polysyllables which his students have recently<br />\nceased to accept were much in evidence in the columns of the Sun. In his<br />\nletter, Dr. Gordon intimated that the Committee on Student Relations lay<br />\nat the crux of the students' power to influence university decisions. He<br />\nproudly stated that the Committee was composed of faculty,<br />\nadministration and students. As we are finding out however, many of the<br />\nmost pertinent facts concerning the Committee have never been seen in<br />\nprint.<br />\nLet us examine, for instance, the manner in which the student<br />\n\"representatives\" were chosen for duty on this important body. Dean<br />\nKimball demanded that two undergraduates and two graduate students be<br />\nchosen to serve on the Committee. Dean Swanson drew the assignment of<br />\ndetermining who the two undergraduates would be. According to the<br />\nlatter, his next step was to request that Russell Passarella select two of his<br />\npeers. However, either Passarella did not hear correctly, or else he was<br />\nnever asked, because he had no part in the process of selection. Dean<br />\nSwanson ended up choosing the two arbitrarily, picking two students<br />\nwhom he knew slightly and reasoning that they would be as representative<br />\nas anyone else he could have chosen. Dean Swanson said, \"I didn't give it<br />\nmuch thought.\" Passarella and the rest of the undergraduate body learned<br />\nidentities of the representatives nearly three weeks after they were named.<br />\nWhen Dr. Swanson heard that Passarella denied ever being asked to<br />\nname two representatives, his memory clouded with exceptional speed. In<br />\nhis first statement he was quite certain that he had spoken to Passarella.<br />\nLess than an hour later, he could barely remember the incident at all.<br />\nMoreover, the Dean was unable to see why such a matter would be of<br />\nconcern to undergraduates at all. He told a News-Letter reporter that the<br />\npaper could print anything it wanted;\"It won't affect me,\" he concluded.<br />\n<br />\nFEAu-nput,<br />\n<br />\n\"The streets of our country arc in turmoil. The<br />\nUniversities are filled with students rebelling and rioting.<br />\nCommunists are seeking to destroy our country. Russia is<br />\nthreatening us with her might. And the republic is in<br />\ndanger. Yes, danger from within and without. We need law<br />\nand order! Yes, without law and order our nation cannot<br />\nsurvive.\"<br />\n<br />\nATTRACTED<br />\nTO<br />\nK)<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\nATTPACTD<br />\nISI-10H121,-S-<br />\n<br />\nThis kind of behavior is common to Hopkins, but very uncommonly<br />\nfound in Dean Swanson. One gets the impression that despite the fact that<br />\nhe is a member of Hopkins' administration, he is not in the least afraid or<br />\ndisdainful of undergraduates. It almost seems, at times, that he wishes he<br />\nwere twenty years old, and on the offensive against hypocracy. So when<br />\none sees him acting hypocritical and defensive, one knows that things have<br />\nsunk to a low ebb.<br />\nAnd although discouraging, what is left in the wake of Dean<br />\nSwanson's enthusiasm and Dr. Gordon's rhetoric is illuminating. The<br />\nfunction of this Committee was to advise the Academic Council on<br />\nmatters which are of interest to students. Thus, it was to be the<br />\nlong-heralded \"input\" promised to students. According to the members of<br />\nthe group, however, this is not the function which will be carried out. The<br />\nCommittee is acting primarily as a fact-finding team for the parent body.<br />\nThe Committee will attempt to advise, in the words of ope member, only<br />\nif it feels strongly enough about the issue involved. The concensus seems<br />\nto be that the fact-finding function of the group will generally take<br />\nprecedence over (perhaps to the exclusion of) its advisory capacity.<br />\n<br />\nAnother revealing fact about the Committee is the, stand which it<br />\ntook on the \"openness\" of its own meetings. A reporter was able to ferret<br />\nout the time and location of one of the meetings (for maximum security,<br />\nit was held in Dr. McElroy's office). He found, however, that the<br />\nCommittee needed to debate whether or not it would allow him to<br />\nobserve. He was asked to leave the room and when he was readmitted, he<br />\nfound that he was perfectly free to be present in any Meeting. That is, in<br />\nany meeting except those during which the Committee is discussing<br />\n\"substantive matters\" (i.e., anything important). In other words, the<br />\nCommittee does not want the students to get in the way while it<br />\nrepresents them.<br />\nHere we have, then, an apt vehicle for conveying student opinion up<br />\nto the perches of the Hopkins elite. This is what we are offered in place of<br />\nfull representation. Undergraduates owe a debt of gratitude to Larry<br />\nCampbell for exposing that which previously had been obscured by<br />\nrhetoric and bureaucratic jibberish. In itself, his resignation was not<br />\ntremendously significant. As a committee member, his effect on decisions<br />\nof the university would have been negligible anyway. What is significant<br />\nis that this year began and ended with the same promises of increased<br />\ncommunication between those who make the decisions and those whom<br />\nthe decisions affect. This year, as in previous years, little progrss was made<br />\ntoward rendering the promise a tangible fact. Undergraduates meet with<br />\nresistance and secrecy from Homewood House. Dean Swandon's actions as<br />\nmentioned above is a perfect example of the administration maxim, \"If<br />\nthe students might be angered over something, keep it secret until we are<br />\nsure that they have forgotten.\" However, this maxim is rapidly loosing its<br />\neffectiveness. Students remember more and more , as the administration<br />\nat Hopkins is due to find out. If Lincoln Gordon continues talking about<br />\nopenning \"broad avenues of communication,\" he cannot continue fending<br />\nstudents off with what must be called \"back alley\" tactics.<br />\n<br />\n[{)T<br />\n<br />\nHA1,750HE<br />\n<br />\nTI-IE<br />\nPPOE31.61/14)(<br />\nWITH<br />\nEQUALITY<br />\n1E-77,0E-6N<br />\n-THE<br />\n56}CES -<br />\n<br />\nl't11111.1tels 11.111 ,11,114.4it 199<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nIS YOU<br />\nHAVE<br />\nTO RE<br />\n6DTit-OAP6P<br />\nKFOPE<br />\nIT<br />\nAF17 165<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 10<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPaton's Long View on Apartheid<br />\nBy CHERRY MICHELMAN<br />\nAlthough he lives isolated in a tragic land, Alan<br />\nPaton is a fortunate man. He is an artist surrounded by<br />\nan endless supply of artistically exploitable material,<br />\nwhose moral perspective is consistent and clear, and for<br />\nwho writing is a form of social as well as artistic<br />\ndedication. As a white, English-speaking South African<br />\nliving in the province of Natal, where he was born,<br />\nPaton's sympathies lie with the aspirations of the<br />\nsocially and politically repressed non-whites. Paton was<br />\nan architect and National Chairman of South Africa's<br />\nLiberal Party, which stands for racial equality, universal<br />\nsuffrage, and and open society in a land which considers<br />\nracial equality a threat and liberalism an accusation.<br />\nFor more than\". twenty years, the Afrikaners,<br />\nwhite, Dutch-speaking descendants of the Boer farmers,<br />\nhave controlled the South African government. Their<br />\nNationalist Party objectives have been to vindicate the<br />\nAfrikaner history, to exalt Afrikaner nationlaism, and to<br />\nestablish and buttress Afrikaner political control. Their<br />\nsocial program, variously called \"Apartheid\", \"Separate<br />\nDevelopment\", \"Baasskap\", and \"White Supremacy\",<br />\nhas been a system of iron laws controlling the political,<br />\neconomic, and social life of South Africa's non-whites.<br />\nBy law, the blacks have been reduced to the status<br />\nof imigrants who may sell their labor in white, urban<br />\nareas, but who can enjoy civil rights only in their<br />\nhomelands, the native reserves, which they may never<br />\nhave seen. By law, families are shattered, educational<br />\nopportunities are whittled down, jobs are denied, and<br />\nhopes are destroyed.. The Afrikaners tell the Africans,<br />\nfive million of whom are de-tribalized, urbanized and<br />\nWestern value-oriented, to go back to tribalism and be<br />\nhappy, and not to seek to become \"imitation<br />\nEuropeans.\"<br />\nAfrikaner consolidation of political control has<br />\nrendered the million English-speaking _whites nearly<br />\npowerless politically. But few of them oppose Apartheid<br />\nas a social goal. They quarrel over its legal structures.its<br />\nseverity, its methods, but seldom with its necessity. The<br />\nLiberals, who are almost without exception<br />\nEnglish-speaking, are not powerful enough today to<br />\nreturn even one representative to Parliament. They are<br />\ndespised, suspected and persecuted by the Government.<br />\nMany of their leaders live under banning orders which<br />\ndeprive them of freedom of speech, movement, and<br />\nassembly.<br />\nSad But Unafraid<br />\nNevertheless, the party remnants, however<br />\nembattled, speak clearly and courageously against the<br />\n<br />\ninhumanity and injustice of Apartheid. They are the<br />\nconscience of the country afraid of its own future and<br />\nwhich justifies its policies by proclaiming its fear. In a<br />\nland where nearly everyone is afraid of something, of the<br />\nGovernment's displeasure if not of the coming<br />\nholocaust, Alan Paton is a saddened but unfrightened<br />\nspokesman for Liberalism. He has not been silenced by<br />\nthe Government, perhaps because his novels enjoy a<br />\nworld-wide reputation, and the Government dislikes<br />\ninternational criticism even more than domestic dissent.<br />\nIn 1968, Paton published a volume of essays, The<br />\nLong View, which represent ten years of his political<br />\nconcerns and his philosophical reflections of and in<br />\nthem. These essays were originally written for his regular<br />\ncolumn, also called \"The Long View\", in Contact, the<br />\nmagazine produced by the Liberal Party until it was<br />\nsilenced by Government decree in 1964.<br />\nNot God's Will<br />\nThe essays deal with the abuse of power, the cost<br />\nof dissent, the spiritual despair as the cost of adversity.<br />\nHe examines the Christian conscience as it affects and is<br />\naffected by South African life. Afrikaners have advanced<br />\nand justified their national aims as the will of God,<br />\nregarding themselves as the instrument of Providence.<br />\nPaton, himself a believing Christian, points out the<br />\ndanger inherent in the idea that one is the chosen<br />\ninstrument of God's will. Mindful of the excesses of the<br />\nInquisition, of Calvin, of Hitler, he suggests that Dr.<br />\nVerwoerd avoid these paranoid claims and concentrate<br />\non the revealed will of God which enjoins man to \"Do<br />\njustice, love mercy, and walk humbly.\"<br />\nQuestioning the claims of Afrikaner Christian<br />\nNationalism, Paton says: \"In my humble view, there is<br />\nonly one way in which a religious politician may<br />\napproach the question of God's will. He will do so<br />\nhumbly, not claiming to know what that will is, but will<br />\ntry to live his life in obedience to the great and small<br />\ncommandments, notably those which command him to<br />\nlove God and his neighbor.\"<br />\nThis may sound like routine theology anywhere<br />\nbut South Africa. There it rings with tragic irony. Paton<br />\nmust plead with a lonely voice for that sounds to anyone<br />\nremoved from the South African conflict like a political<br />\ncliche: \"No law is good that harms people.\" He speaks<br />\nto those he terms \"nice Christians\", who feel no qualms<br />\nof morality or logic in saying, \"I have scome to believe<br />\nthat we must have apartheid with as little brutality as<br />\npossible.\"<br />\nIn his description of Robert Kennedy's South<br />\nAfrican tour in 1965 Paton again demonstrates how the<br />\n<br />\nstatement of the liberal faith, which may sound<br />\nunremarkable to any Western audience, sounded<br />\nexciting, exhilarating, daring, like a fresh wind from a<br />\nwider world. In noting that Kennedy was accused of<br />\nhaving gone to South Africa to benefit himself<br />\npolitically, Paton observes that if Prime Minister<br />\nVerwoerd could benefit himself politically by going<br />\nabroad, he would do so, if he could find a country to go<br />\nto.<br />\nNo Revolution<br />\nKennedy's five-day visit to South Africa was a very<br />\nbrief respite from the frustration and despair of the<br />\nembattled liberals there. There is little hope that the<br />\nGovernment will reverse its policies. Opposition is<br />\nincreasingly silenced. Even the declared enemies of<br />\nApartheid do not look forward to a revolution of the<br />\nnon-whites or to armed intervention from outsiders.<br />\nThey have no near prospect of a solution, nothing<br />\nconcrete to hope for.<br />\nIn this sad circumstance, perhaps the most moving<br />\nof the essays in this collection, which includes<br />\nthoughtful portraits of Cheif Albert Luthuli, of Dr.<br />\nVerwoerd, of Father Trevor Huddleston (the deported<br />\nAnglican priest,) is \"Beware of Melancholy\". In it, he<br />\ndescribes the ominous future he sees for those who<br />\ncontinue to dissent. To the hardest of questions, \"Is it<br />\nworth trying to last?\", he gives the humble answer, \"I<br />\ndon't know.\"<br />\nSomeone once characterized a liberal as \"a man<br />\nwith both feet firmly planted in mid-air.\" In the<br />\namplification of his answer, Paton glorifies that stance:<br />\n\"If someone were to ask me,'What would you and your<br />\nwife do if you had young children?', I would answer,<br />\n'We would have two choices: to stay here and give our<br />\nchildren a father and mother who put some things above<br />\ntheir own children's safety and happiness, or to leave<br />\nand to give them a father and mother who put their<br />\nchildren's safety and happiness above all else.' Which<br />\nwould I choose? They are both good choices, are they<br />\nnot? I hope I would choose the first.\"<br />\nIn the beginning of this article, I called Alan Paton<br />\na fortunate man. Fortunate does not mean happy. A<br />\nman who is sensitive to suffering can never be happy in<br />\nthe midst of suffering. A man who loves freedom cannot<br />\nbe happy among those deprived of freedom. Paton has<br />\nsomething even more important to his spiritual and<br />\nartistic fulfillment - a searing vision of what is right and<br />\nought to be. He considers this to be luck: \"Life has<br />\ntaught me - and this is my luck - that active loving saves<br />\none from morbid preoccupation with the shortcomings<br />\nof society.\"<br />\n<br />\nOur American Heritage<br />\nGeorge McClellan Over Barry Goldwater<br />\n<br />\nby ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThere is a fair amount of<br />\nconfusion as to the intent of General<br />\nGeorge B. McClellan's campaign for<br />\nPresident in 1864. The primary sources<br />\nconcerning this campaign compound,<br />\nrather than dispel, the confusion. There<br />\nare McClellan broadsides and campaign<br />\nsongs indicating that the General desired<br />\nimmediate conciliation of the South.<br />\nEqually good material indicated.<br />\nthat the General intended to prosecute<br />\nthe war and was in emotional agony lest<br />\nthe sacrifices of the first four years be in<br />\nvain.<br />\nOne of the chief difficulties is that<br />\nGeneral 'McClellan was not one of the<br />\nprime movers in his own nomination.<br />\nHe was not indifferent to the honor,<br />\nsome commentators considered<br />\nMcClellan and the Democratic platform<br />\nan anomalous combination, \"a war<br />\nDemocrat on a peace platform.\"<br />\nIndeed, McClellan's chief<br />\nadvantages as a candidate were that he<br />\nwas nationally well known and (unlike<br />\nHoratio Seymour, who ran third for the<br />\nnomination) could not have his record<br />\ndistorted into tacit sympathy with the<br />\nConfederacy.<br />\nCrackling Broadside<br />\nThe Democratic platform went as<br />\nfar toward conciliation as would be<br />\nreasonably possible without advocating<br />\nrecognition of the Confederacy. The<br />\nplatform did not resemble the wordy,<br />\nturgid concoctions of today. It was a<br />\ncrackling campaign broadside which<br />\ndisplayed little enthusiasm to pursue the<br />\nwar. A fast settlement on the basis of<br />\n<br />\nthe Union of the states was<br />\nrecommended.<br />\nThere were also criticisms of<br />\nPresident Lincoln's administration for<br />\nthe use of troops in loyal states and<br />\nrestrictions on wartime civil liberties.<br />\nCertain of the criticisms were<br />\noverstated, but there was a definite case<br />\nto be made.<br />\nBetray the Troops<br />\nGeneral McClellan's letter of<br />\nacceptance is not antagonistic to the<br />\nDemocratic platform, but it does<br />\nreorder the emphasis concerning certain<br />\npoints. McClellan stressed that no<br />\nsettlement could recognize the<br />\nConfederacy; he implied that such a<br />\ncapitulation would betray the troops<br />\nwhom he had led through several<br />\ncampaigns.<br />\nOn the other hand, he stressed<br />\nthat the South should have to concede<br />\nnothing beyond its status as a separate<br />\nrepublic. He said,\"The Union is the one<br />\ncondition of peace we ask no more.\"<br />\nThis indicates that the Emancipation<br />\nProclamation, which as promulgated by<br />\nMr. Lincoln, applied only to areas in<br />\nrebellion, would not be part of a peace<br />\nsettlement.<br />\nNo more Vietnams<br />\nHowever, it does appear that the<br />\ndifferences between the McClellan and<br />\nLincoln policies were not as great as<br />\nthey are sometimes represented. Neither<br />\nwas willing to recognize the existance of<br />\nthe Confederacy. But Mr. Lincoln,<br />\nnotwithstanding the Emancipation<br />\nProclamation, never indicated a belief in<br />\na radical peace settlement.<br />\n<br />\nIn this year, the Republicans tried<br />\nto fudge their sectional character by<br />\ncalling their convention the National<br />\nUnion Convention and sending forth<br />\nAndrew Johnson the slaveholding<br />\nTennessee Democrat, as Mr. Lincoln's<br />\nrunning mate. It will be remembered<br />\nthat, as late as the Hampton Roads<br />\nconference of February 8, 1865, Mr.<br />\nLincoln proposed a settlement which is<br />\nconsonant with the spirit of General<br />\nMcClellan's acceptance letter.<br />\nThis is not to say that American<br />\nhistory would be about the same if Mr.<br />\nMcClellan had won the election. For the<br />\nmost important point, there would be<br />\nno Lincoln legend. Lincoln would be<br />\nremembered as a dark-horse candidate<br />\nfor President who could not muster<br />\ntwo-fifths of the popular vote in his<br />\nelection, who was powerless to stop the<br />\nUnion from crumbling immediately<br />\nafterwards, and who could conceive of<br />\nno more imaginative solution than a war<br />\nof attrition between sections. His defeat<br />\nfor re-election would be regarded as the<br />\ncrowning piece to four years of failure.<br />\nRealm of Possibility<br />\nIt is also true that the Democrats<br />\nwere generally identified in the public<br />\nmind with peace. McClellan would not<br />\nhave wanted to settle hurriedly, but as a<br />\nDemocrat, elected in protest to Lincoln,<br />\nhe would have been under intense<br />\npressure to make a fast settlement. That<br />\nthe Confederacy would have received<br />\nattractive concessions, and perhaps even<br />\na degree of autonomy, must be<br />\nconsidered within the realm of<br />\n<br />\npossibility.<br />\nIn the early stages of the election,<br />\nit appeared that McClellan might win.<br />\nRepublican managers in Congress were<br />\nso agonized that they admitted Nevada<br />\nto the Union in order to assure<br />\nthemselves of three more electoral<br />\nvotes. President Lincoln committed an<br />\nact fully equal to those which met the<br />\nopprobrium of the Democratic platform<br />\nwriters. He organized furloughs for<br />\nsoldiers so that they could vote for<br />\nhim.(There was an element of risk in<br />\nthis, since McClellan, who certainly<br />\ndidn't overwork his soldiers, had been<br />\nconsidered wildly popular among them.<br />\nHowever, in 1864 the soldier vote was<br />\nfairly solid for Lincoln).<br />\nDistortion of Votes<br />\nHowever, the election was not<br />\nreally in doubt after General Sherman<br />\nentered Atlanta in late September.

Neither is<br />\nantifilm or anti-play. All three share the element of<br />\nanti-fiction, a rendering of both real and fictional<br />\nworlds, with reminders to the viewer of each aspect.<br />\nWhenever the artist stops his imaginative action and<br />\naddresses his audience with a \"dear reader\" scene, he<br />\ninterrupts his fiction and exposes his work as mere<br />\nimitation of reality. But the success of this technique,<br />\nancient in the arts, is based on its valid result: not to<br />\ndestroy the fictional world but invite the viewer into a<br />\nmore intimate sharing of it.<br />\nOne can easily spend an after-exams, anti-fictional<br />\n(no pun) weekend in New York. Go to bookstores and<br />\nbuy Richard Brautigan to read in the afternoons, and go<br />\nto see Warhol's \"Lonesome Cowboys,\", \"I Am Curious<br />\n(Yellow),\" and \"Dionysus in 69\" at night. Novels, films,<br />\nand plays are a curious invitation into pleasant, but<br />\nsometimes frightening, fiction. Yet each exposes its own<br />\nunreality by exploring with varying degrees of<br />\neffectiveness the anti-fictional techniques of modern<br />\nartistic expression.<br />\nBoth Fiction and Reality<br />\nBrautigan, San Francisco poet and novelist, has<br />\ncome East at last, even convincing Grove Press to publish<br />\nhis best-known book, A Confederate General From Big<br />\nSur. Unlike the \"dear reader\" asides and digressions in<br />\n\"Tom Jones\" or Vanity Fair, or George Elliot's novels,<br />\nBrautigan weaves fiction and anti-fiction in such a way<br />\nthat the reader is never fully aware of what is reality and<br />\nwhat is not. As in Wallace Stevens' poetry, there is a<br />\nconstant \"war between the mind and sky,\" and fiction<br />\nand reality are never distinct.<br />\nConfederate General isandis not about Lee Mellon<br />\nand his grandfather, who was or was not a general in the<br />\nConfederacy. Mellon seems to care about his family<br />\n<br />\nhistory at first, as does the narrator, but neither one<br />\nallows the fiction to interrupt daily life on Big Sur. Or is<br />\nAn Unlikely Name<br />\nAn earlier novel, Trout Fishing in America, is an<br />\neven better example of anti-fiction. Like Thoreau's<br />\nWalden, it is both a natural history and a \"novel,\" a<br />\nmyth about man coming of age in his relationship to<br />\nnature. Brautigan is more deliberately anti-novelistic in<br />\ntechnique. As Walden Pond is so often personified,<br />\nTrout Fishing becomes interchangeably the novel, its<br />\ntitle, its subject (though only vaguely is this a fish story),<br />\nthe author, the narrator, and more often a character who<br />\nsigns letters with his unlikely name and goes through<br />\nvarious adventures.<br />\nBrautigan never ceases to dash the reader's<br />\ncomplacency, dragging him from one world to the other<br />\nwith the result that the novel both is and is not about<br />\nitself. The book engages every form, from fantastic<br />\nfiction in the \"sea, Sea Rider\" chapter, to anti-novel<br />\nchapters about its cover picture, to Thoreauvian journal<br />\nlists, to a chapter about the book's last word,<br />\n\"mayonaise.\" A the end of the final letter, this word is<br />\nthere simply because the narrator tells the reader it will<br />\nbe, having had the desire some day to write a book with<br />\nsuch an ending.<br />\nWhen Brautigan tells the reader how and when he<br />\nis writing a novel, he creates the same anti-fictional<br />\nfeeling as when he tells the reader to plant a novel. And<br />\n\"Please Plant This Book\" contains seeds to be planted.<br />\nWhat is fact and/or fiction here?<br />\nBisexual Cowboys<br />\nWarhol has been doing this for years on film,<br />\ncreating both a world of characters and a world for the<br />\naudience. Very often his people, real and playing real<br />\nplus fictional roles, talk to the audience, sometimes to<br />\nthe cameraman, and even to each other about the<br />\n<br />\nr\u2014Veritas<br />\n<br />\nfilm-life process. There is never purely a story fiction,<br />\nbut always an inter-play of reality and \"plot.\"<br />\nThe closest Warhol has come to a story is<br />\n\"Lonesome Cowboys.\" It is. also his funniest, least<br />\nboring and thoroughly enjoyable film, besides being a<br />\nmockery of western movies. The bisexual cowboys also<br />\npartake of two other simultaneous worlds. They are<br />\nanachronistic: smoking filters, surfing, drinking ring-top<br />\ncans of beer, listening to the Beatles, etc. But they are*<br />\ncowboys in the old West too, lusting it up on the range,<br />\neven to the point of acting out what someone has<br />\nsuggested is a new Romeo and Juliet play.<br />\nBut as in Brautigan's novels, nothing is certain,<br />\nneither the cowboys' nor that of the hilarious spoof of a<br />\nsheriff (at night a drag-queen Indian), nor the characters'<br />\nidentity. If Viva is a female Romeo(Ramona), and Tom<br />\nis a male Juliet (Julian), and the incomparably gay<br />\nTaylor Mead is a \"nurse,\" this solves nothing. Julian and<br />\nTom change names and identities, and no one really<br />\nknows who he is for sure. And it is Ramona who<br />\nmanfully seduces him (her?), whoever this silent,<br />\nenigmatic sex-god may be.<br />\nAdded to this problem are the constant speeches<br />\nand asides to the audience, telling us it is all fiction,<br />\ntogether with the film's absurd moralizing. What should<br />\nlonesome cowboys do?Settle in towns, build them into<br />\ncities, and \"get ready for World War I.\" The viewer<br />\nknows this is a farce of reality but he also enjoys the<br />\nfiction that is sporadically, even pathetically, created<br />\nand sustained.<br />\nNot That Simple<br />\n\"I Am Curious (Yellow)\" is even more anti-film in<br />\ngenre, being a film about making a film. Now and then<br />\nthe director is shown directing and editing, cameras<br />\nfilming, and the action stopping for more light or retakes<br />\nor for the actors to stop fighting. Yet the division is not<br />\nthat simple. The viewer never knows when Lena and<br />\nI (Continued on Page 13)<br />\n<br />\n'Anti-ROTC Drive Reflects Anti-War Sentiment I<br />\nBy RAYMOND W. COPSON<br />\nSDS and the New University Conference have<br />\nraised the question of the presence of ROTC on the<br />\nHopkins campus. In ordinary times, this presence<br />\nattracted scant interest. However, because ROTC trains<br />\nthose lower echelon officers most useful in the war in<br />\nVietnam, the issue of ROTC has attracted considerable<br />\ninterest outside radical circles on this and other<br />\ncampuses where the war is widely opposed.<br />\nNonetheless, many members of the Hopkins<br />\nCommunity who are opposed to the war in Vietnam<br />\nseem reluctant to take a position against ROTC. In part,<br />\nthis reluctance is the result of opposition to the tactics<br />\nemployed by SDS in raising the issue. As far as tactics<br />\nare concerned, it is difficult to resist the comparison<br />\nMade by SDS between its tactics and those taught by<br />\nROTC. This comparison aside, there is no reason why<br />\nthe tactics employed by some ought to foreclose<br />\ndiscussion and action on the issue by others.<br />\nIn large part, the failure of many peace elements<br />\nto take a stand against ROTC is the result of doubt<br />\nabout the effectiveness of pressure on ROTC as an<br />\nanti-war measure and of fears that undesireable indirect<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nGOOD HUMOUR needs part time<br />\nsalesman now -- and full time<br />\nlalesmen through the Summer.<br />\nIf you can serve a GOOD<br />\nHUMOUR territory from NOW<br />\nTHROUGH MAY on<br />\nSATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS,<br />\nYou will average $25.00 per day in<br />\ncommissions - with a guaranteed<br />\nMinimum in case of bad weather.<br />\nALL EQUIPMENT FURNISHED.<br />\nWILL BE FULLY<br />\nTRAINED and serve some of our<br />\nbest territories.<br />\n<br />\nYOU<br />\n<br />\nTO QUALIFY: You must be 18<br />\nYears of age or older and possess a<br />\nvalid driver's license!<br />\nIf you desire to work in the<br />\nMARYLAND AREA, please call<br />\n52-5330 or come in for an<br />\nI nterview to GOOD HUMOR<br />\nCORPORATION, 1932<br />\nqREENSPRING DRIVE,<br />\nTIMONIUM, MD. 21093.<br />\nIf you desire to work in the<br />\nPENNSYLVANIA AREA, please<br />\n342-4700.<br />\n<br />\neffects might follow abolition of the program. Now no<br />\none has maintained that the abolition of ROTC would<br />\ncripple the US military. What is maintained, however is<br />\nthat agitation against ROTC by students leading to<br />\nrestrictions on ROTC or its abolition at Hopkins and<br />\nelsewhere must raise serious questions in the military<br />\nand in the government about the policy which has led to<br />\nthese heretofore unknown pressures.<br />\nProfessional Military<br />\nSince other modes of action aimed at the war in<br />\nVietnam and US interventionism in general have fallen<br />\ninto disuse as a result of recurrent disappointment,<br />\npressure on ROTC is one of the few means available to<br />\nprevent dissent from the war policy from languishing<br />\naltogether. Some claim of effectiveness must therefore<br />\nbe granted anti-ROTC activity as an anti-war protest.<br />\nOne much-feared side effect of the abolition of<br />\nROTC is the supposed professionalization of the military<br />\nwhich would follow. Since the existence of a<br />\nprofessional U.S. military cannot now be questioned,<br />\nthis fear taken seriously actually reflects the belief that<br />\nan officer corps trained outside ROTC would be more<br />\naggressive, more interventionist and more inclined to<br />\nserve its own interests rather than those of the civilian<br />\n4111iliFilifIRIARBRZ<br />\n<br />\nBeefmaster's<br />\nPub<br />\n<br />\nHOWARD at 27th ST.<br />\n<br />\nFAREWELL<br />\nHOPKINS<br />\nGRADUATES<br />\n<br />\nw<br />\n<br />\nENJOY A<br />\n<br />\nSTEER<br />\n'N BEER<br />\n<br />\n,z4 GREENWAY PHARMACY<br />\nCHARLES & 34 STS.<br />\n14111111RRRRRIIRRW<br />\n<br />\nMENU<br />\n<br />\nBREAK<br />\nThe best beef sandwich in<br />\ntown.

This<br />\nassumption is highly questionable. In the first place,<br />\nmost ROTC graduates come not from the few liberal<br />\neastern universities but from small colleges and large<br />\nstate universities which have a decidedly conservative<br />\norientation. Moreover, at all campuses ROTC tends to<br />\nattract the more conservative students who are<br />\ncommitted to values much like those of their service<br />\nacademy courterparts.<br />\nFurther, it is doubtful that the place of education<br />\nis more important in shaping\"professionalism\" than the<br />\nimposed career patterns, in-service training and shared<br />\nexperiences\u2014 in battle and out\u2014which characterize<br />\nmilitary service. This is not to say that all military<br />\nofficers arc equally aggressive and interventionist, but<br />\nsimply that little reason can be given for the claim that<br />\nROTC encourages amateurism among ranking military<br />\nofficers.<br />\nNor can one maintain that the abolition of ROTC<br />\nwould foster a less intelligent officer corps. Service<br />\nacademy admissions standards compare favorable in<br />\ngeneral with those at colleges where ROT(' is available.<br />\nSelection processes used as alternatives to ROTC,such as<br />\nOCS, necessarily recruit as intelligent a group of<br />\ncandidates as they can. Should ROTC be abolished,<br />\nvolunteers for officer recruitment would most probably<br />\nbe thosewho would have enrolled in ROTC anyway.<br />\nIf it is true that no dire changes in the military<br />\nwould !result from the abolition of ROTC, it is also true<br />\nthat the University could well survive without providing<br />\nmilitary training to its undergraduates Hopkins does not<br />\nhave professional schools in such fields as law and hotel<br />\nmanagement. Surely it would be little impoverished by<br />\nthe departure of ROTC.<br />\nReferendum Essential<br />\nSince abolition could be so readily absorbed, why<br />\nmust the future of ROTC be decided in the secretive<br />\nhigh councils of this university'? The presence of ROTC<br />\non the campus reflects upon the entire university,<br />\ngraduate students, and faculty.<br />\nIf ROTC loses, the administration will recognize<br />\nthat action is best taken now before the latent support<br />\nfor SDS can be radicalized. If ROTC wins, the SDS<br />\nposition will be undercut and future disruptions on this<br />\nissue will be less likely.<br />\nThose who would suffer most from the abolition<br />\nof ROTC are those undergraduates who would be forced<br />\nto serve two years in the ranks or to spend an additional<br />\nyear in the service to obtain a commission through OCS.<br />\nHowever, because of the uses to which the ROTC<br />\nprogram is now being put by the government, the time<br />\nhas come for the University to weigh this hardship<br />\nagainst the opportunity to take an effective step against<br />\nthe war which has made some military hardship<br />\ninevitable for nearly all students.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 12<br />\n<br />\nAcademic Council to Consider Coeducation Plan<br />\nThe Academic Council will soon<br />\nreceive a report asking that the Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate body be made<br />\nco-educational by 1971.<br />\nThe report which is being<br />\nprepared by the Spcial Committee on<br />\nCo-education, was the object of<br />\nTuesday's Student Council - sponsored<br />\nDialogue discussion. Dean Carl<br />\nSwanson, Committee chairman, pointed<br />\nout that the Committee's formation<br />\nresulted from the faculty's<br />\n\"overwhelming desire to be associated<br />\nwith co-education.\" He defined the<br />\nCommittee's purpose as \"the<br />\nexamination of the feasability and<br />\ndesireability of co-education at<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nNo Plans<br />\nAlthough no concrete plans have<br />\nyet been made, Swanson pointed out<br />\nthat there will be no change in the total<br />\nnumber of students admitted each year.<br />\nThus the co-eds will in fact supplant a<br />\nnumber of what would otherwise have<br />\nbeen male undergraduates. Swanson<br />\nfavors co-education, feeling that the<br />\nUniversity should be \"open to the best<br />\nstudents, regardless of sex.\" He feels<br />\nthat the admission of women would<br />\nuplift the social and intellectual aspects<br />\nof Homewood and would \"provide a<br />\nviable and active student body.\"<br />\nSwanson indicated that<br />\nimplementation of co-education would<br />\nbe done by the administration.<br />\nHe mentioned that a number of<br />\nother problems, such as housing \u2022 (it<br />\nwould cost $300,000 to make the old<br />\n<br />\ndorms suitable for female inhabitation),<br />\nwould have to be taken in detail. later.<br />\nHe also felt that the University should<br />\nlend a hand in increasing the social<br />\nfacilities on campus.<br />\nThe Dean hopes to get the report<br />\nto the Council at its last meeting this<br />\nmonth. That way the Council will be<br />\nable to examine it and tell the<br />\n.Committee what further information it<br />\nneeds in order to act.<br />\nImprove Conditions<br />\nDr. Jack Greene, a professor of<br />\nHistory and member of the Committee,<br />\nstrongly favors co-education as a means<br />\nto \"improve the intellectual<br />\nenvironment at Hopkins.\" Basing his<br />\nobservations on prior experience<br />\nobtained while teaching mixed classes at<br />\nMichigan State, Dr. Greene proposed<br />\nthat female students would serve as an<br />\n\"intellectual prod\" to male students,<br />\nthus relieving the dullness and \"lack of<br />\nintellectual involvement that now<br />\ncharacterize undergraduate classes.\"<br />\nDr. Greene talked of the<br />\n\"dynamics of a class\", saying that for<br />\nsome reason boys don't do assigned<br />\nwork unless threatened with tests and<br />\nquizzes. Girls, however, do their<br />\nassignments and, in a mixed class, the<br />\nboys work in order to keep above the<br />\ngirls.<br />\nClaiming that there are \"no<br />\ngrounds for excluding females\" Dr.<br />\nGreene voiced opposition to any plans<br />\nfor treating women differently from<br />\nmen should they ever arrive on campus.<br />\nHe particularly referred to housing,<br />\n<br />\nsaying that there should be \"no increase<br />\nin parietal rules\" for women. He favors<br />\nthe implementation of co-education by<br />\n\"no later than 1970.\"<br />\nOpposition<br />\nA slightly differing view was<br />\noffered by Professor of Physics Donald<br />\nKerr, also a Committee member. Asking<br />\nthat the submission of the report be<br />\npostponed, Dr. Kerr referred to the<br />\nnecessity of initiating a more detailed<br />\nstudy before deciding whether or not to<br />\naccept co-education. He pointed out<br />\nthat co-education would \"change very<br />\nprofoundly the nature of the<br />\nUniversity;\" that while there will be<br />\ncertain gains, \"other things and people<br />\nwill pay.\"<br />\nIn particular, Dr. Kerr stressed the<br />\nnecessity of investigating the effects of<br />\nco-education on the different<br />\n<br />\ndepartments. He cited studies made at<br />\nPrinceton and Yale that indicate a<br />\nnatural decrease in enrollment in the<br />\nsciences and engineering with a<br />\ncorresponding increase in interest in the<br />\nhumanities and social sciences. This, he<br />\nfelt, would ultimately produce an effect<br />\non the University and its reputation.<br />\nSuch an effect \"could not be taken<br />\nlightly.\"<br />\nDr. Kerr continued by saying that<br />\nhe had not yet made up his mind<br />\nwhether or not to support the<br />\nproposals. He was not arguing against<br />\nco-education, he claimed, only asking<br />\nthat more time be devoted to studying<br />\nthe matter. \"It is impossible to act<br />\nintelligently in this short time,\" he said,<br />\n\"although we ought to be able to reach<br />\nsome decision during the next academic<br />\nyear.\"<br />\n<br />\nGordon Finds Open Door<br />\nRobert Bilgrave, Director of<br />\nStudent Affairs, announced his<br />\nintention \"to speak in broad<br />\ngeneralities,\" and then proceeded to do<br />\nso.<br />\n<br />\nlowest position on the university<br />\nthat<br />\npriority list.\" He further observed the<br />\naffecting<br />\n\"every decision<br />\nundergraduate has always been made<br />\nfrom a faculty administrative<br />\nviewpoint.\"<br />\n<br />\nJohn Guess began his comments<br />\nwith the observation that he did not feel<br />\nthat he, as an undergraduate, was \"a<br />\npolicymaker,\" though he hoped that<br />\n\"students would be policymakers in the<br />\nfuture.\"<br />\nGuess charged that \"the<br />\nundergraduate has always had the<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gordon replied that it was<br />\n\"wrong to suppose that teaching is the<br />\nonly function of this University:' He<br />\nwent on to point out that \"Hopkins is<br />\nprimarily a research... and professionallY<br />\noriented university, for those who feel<br />\nthey can realize themselves in such all<br />\nenvironment.\"<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from Page 3)<br />\n<br />\nThe Goucher College Magic Circle<br />\nChapter of the Maria Goretti Society<br />\nannounces the final meeting of the 1969<br />\nspring term.

Since Hopkins seeks to enroll a<br />\nfreshman class of 525, approximately 1050 students<br />\nmust be accepted. The class size at this time stands at<br />\n533, although that number is not final as \"there are<br />\nalways a few summer withdrawls.\"<br />\nApril 15<br />\nMr. Brinkley labeled the University's admissions<br />\npolicy as \"precipitous ',' in the sense that Hopkins mails<br />\nall its decisions at once, on April 15 of each year. This is<br />\nopposed to the former practice of accepting a number of<br />\n\"early decision\" candidates (applicants who specified<br />\nHopkins as their first choice and promised to enroll here<br />\nif accepted). The \"early decision\" plan has been in use<br />\nunder former Admissions Director, Robert Bilgraves, but<br />\nwas discontinued before Brinkley assumed the<br />\nDirectorship.<br />\nConcerning the type of student who is accepted by<br />\nthe Office of Admissions, Brinkley stressed academic<br />\nachievement as the major criterion. \"We are primarily<br />\n<br />\ninterested in academic and intellectual interests and<br />\nabilities, although we also want students with interests in<br />\noutside activities.\" The Director said that he was not<br />\n\"turned off\" by prospective applicants who come to<br />\ninterviews in long hair or hippie dress. Such things, he<br />\nfelt, are not as important as the student's academic<br />\nrecord.<br />\nWhen asked if he thought that a trend toward<br />\nactivism is developing in the younger classes, Mr.<br />\nBrinkley thought that t'this might be true, and that there<br />\nmight ill fact be a .sort of \"generation gap\" between the<br />\nseniors and freshman. \"Hopkins,\" said the Director, \"is<br />\ninterested in involved people; our students are typical of<br />\nthe college-going generation today.\" He also mentioned<br />\nthat it is impossible to forecast the make-up of any<br />\nincoming class at this early date. The major reason cited<br />\nwas the great disparity between , the number of<br />\nacceptances and the number of actual enrollments.<br />\nAs to increased Negro enrollment, Mr. Brinkley<br />\nsaid that the University is \"very much interested in<br />\nminority groups.\" He pointed out that a wide<br />\nsocio-economic distribution is in, a way \"self-educating\"<br />\nin that it promotes the interaction of students with<br />\ndiverse interests and backgrounds.<br />\nMr. Brinkley was particularly grateful to the Black<br />\nStudents Union for . its assistance in recruiting black<br />\nstudents. Despite these efforts, however. Hopkins will<br />\nenroll only as many minority students as last year. The<br />\nreason given for this is the intense competition for high<br />\ncaliber non-white students among major universities.<br />\n<br />\nOn the subject of co-education, Mr. Brinkley felt<br />\nthat the admission of women students would not .affect<br />\nany appreciable change in admissions procedures.<br />\nHopkins would continue to accept \"the same caliber of<br />\nstudent in terms of academic potential\" as it does now.<br />\n<br />\nWilliam Brinkley, Director of Admissions, said next year's class<br />\nwas selected from the largest number of applicants in Hopkins'<br />\nhistory.<br />\n<br />\nTheater: \"A Most Intimate Place\"<br />\n(Continued from Page 11)<br />\n<br />\nBorje (who keep their real names) are<br />\nPlaying their parts or being themselves, whether<br />\ntheir celebrated nude scenes are between actors<br />\nor characters. The only certainty we have<br />\n(looking up at the projection room to be sure) is<br />\nthat the whole thing is a film. But which film?<br />\nThe movie and its filming both coincide and<br />\ninterchange, but never for certain is it either/or.<br />\nThe best example is when the film stops to<br />\nannounce a guessing contest for the audience.But<br />\nfor which audience and of which film? The film<br />\nbeing made in the film or the already made film<br />\nbeing shown in the theater? Blank.

The<br />\ndemocratic process is meaningful only after the<br />\nelectorate is informed of the issues, not before.<br />\nFinally, to take a poll while this ROTC issue is<br />\nstill so emotional is absurd.<br />\nSecond: the poll falsely states the<br />\nanti-ROTC position. In their letters to Dr.<br />\nGordon, the anti-ROTC forces asked that the<br />\nimmediate elimination of the ROTC program at<br />\nHopkins be coupled with a prevision for<br />\nequivalent university scholarships to replace<br />\ncurrent ROTC scholarships.<br />\nIn view or these objections, I suggest that<br />\nthe poll of The Subcommittee of the Academic<br />\nCouncil on Student Affairs be voided.<br />\nS.M. Rothstein<br />\nTURNER'S TURN<br />\nEditors:<br />\nthe<br />\nTo<br />\nIn reference to the recent problems with<br />\nthe budget of the Department of Physical<br />\nEducation and Athletics, I would like to make<br />\ntwo comments.<br />\nFirst, I want to commend our athletes and<br />\nfriends for the manner in which<br />\nstudent<br />\ntheir<br />\nthey conducted themselves in requesting the<br />\nUniversity to reconsider its position toward the<br />\nwhole sports and physical education program and<br />\nits budget implications. I am very proud that<br />\nthey presented their appeal in the proper manner<br />\nand through the proper channels. I am hopeful<br />\nthat fact had some influence on the final<br />\noutcome.<br />\nSecondly, there was reference in Mr.<br />\nBernstein's article in the May 9 issue to the \"high<br />\nlevel of stealing on the part of service employees<br />\nof the center.\" There unfortunately has been<br />\nsome, not so much of equipment as of money,<br />\nand where proved, the men have been dismissed.<br />\nI regret to say that some of the equipment<br />\nlosses occur because a few of our students take<br />\nadvantage of our inadequate help in the Center.<br />\nUnknown outsiders brought in by some of our<br />\nfaculty and students as guests and then turned<br />\nloose in the building also do their share of taking<br />\nitems.<br />\ncould not let the assumption rest that<br />\nstealing by our help in the Center is the main<br />\nreason our equipment situation is so desperate.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nMarshall S. Turner, Jr.<br />\nVERITAS?<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to challenge the \"Veritas\"<br />\narticle by Robert M. Lipshutz in which he states<br />\n\"ROTC civilianizes the Army.\" Mr. Lipshutz<br />\nseems to believe that most college graduates have<br />\nbeen liberalized and would question military<br />\ndoctrine more than their \"friends from back<br />\nhome.\" Either Mr. Lipshutz has a dim-witted<br />\nbunch of friends or he fails to realize that most<br />\nardent hawks and those who control the Armed<br />\nServices have college educations. Besides, what<br />\nhappens to those college graduates who were not<br />\nin the ROTC program? They get drafted and end<br />\nup as enlisted men or, in many cases, go through<br />\nOCS and become officers anyway. Many ROTC<br />\nofficers find themselves as firing range<br />\ninstructors, recruitors, or in other \"vital\"<br />\nposit ions.<br />\nI'm a rare animal on the Hopkins campus<br />\nsince I'm an undergraduate and a veteran of<br />\nVietnam- a victim of the draft. I was assigned to<br />\nan aviation unit and worked in the Operations<br />\nSection, so I was exposed to all types of<br />\nand ROTC men, West Pointers,<br />\nof<br />\nWarrent Officers, and even WWII Field<br />\nCommissioned Officers. I found that \u201ethe ROTC<br />\nofficers ranked with the Pointers :IS the most<br />\n\"gungho.\" Warrant Officers are the most civilian<br />\ntype. In fact, they are referred to as \"Mr. X\"<br />\nrather than \"Major Y, sir!\" OCS officers have all<br />\nbeen through the mill as enlisted men and were<br />\nquite humanistic, or at least sympathetic, in their<br />\noutlyok. To cite ,one instance of an enlightened<br />\ncollege graduate: our Company Commander, a<br />\nROTC man; was\u2022on his way to the showers one<br />\nevening and passed through the enlisted men's<br />\n<br />\ntent area. He happened to overhear a slightly<br />\nenebriated door-gunner utter a few profane<br />\nwords about LBJ. Well, by the time the dust<br />\ncleared, the hapless gunner was given a six month<br />\nvacation at the LBJ (Long Binh Jail). Certainly<br />\nnot all ROTC officers are like this, but I think<br />\nyou get the point, Mr. Lipshutz.<br />\nI would like to suggest that ROTC<br />\nvoluntarily withdraw itself from the Hopkins<br />\ncampus and establish its headquarters on its own<br />\nland. This could be a strategic retreat. For<br />\ninstance, if there were one ROTC center in the<br />\nBaltimore area, it could offer its benefits to all<br />\nstudents in its proximity. It would have<br />\nexpanded facilities since it would draw students<br />\nfrom Hopkins, Morgan, Towson, Loyola, etc.<br />\nROTC would benefit since there could be no<br />\nconflict of interest with the colleges, it would<br />\nnot have to tolerate harassment from SDS or<br />\n\"guerrilla theater,\" and there would be a greater<br />\nmixture of students within the program. ROTC<br />\ncandidates would benefit from the larger and<br />\nbetter facilities. The Hopkins administration<br />\nwould be relieved of one of its many headaches<br />\nand even SDS could declare a victory since<br />\nROTC was\"abolished\" from campus.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nBob Tindall<br />\nROTC: PRO...<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe New University Committee's demand<br />\nto expel ROTC from the Hopkins Campus<br />\ninvolves at least two principles which are<br />\nnecessary for any university, new or old.<br />\nThe first is that any group within the<br />\nuniversity has a right to exist and use the<br />\nfacilities no matter what their ideology. The<br />\nAmerican Nazi Party and ROTC have as much<br />\nright to be here as SDS and the YMCA.<br />\nExpulsion of a group from the university should<br />\nbe done only for repeated or serious violations of<br />\nethics and good conduct. The political point of<br />\nview represented by ROTC has nothing to do<br />\nwith its qualifications to be on campus.<br />\nThe second principle is Due Process. If<br />\nROTC is charged with violations of ethics and<br />\ngood conduct, then the evidence should be<br />\npresented before an appropriate judicial body:<br />\none already in existence or one specially<br />\nappointed or elected. We need documented<br />\nevidence formally presented, not campaign<br />\nrhetoric at a May Day rally.<br />\nGuidelines defining ethics and good<br />\nconduct have already been established by the<br />\nAmerican Association of University Professors in<br />\norder to protect the academic freedom of faculty<br />\nmembers. These same guidelines could easily be<br />\napplied to the ROTC question. If ROTC needs to<br />\nbe expelled from Hopkins, let it be done for the<br />\nproper reasons and using the proper proceedure.<br />\nJohn Wickham<br />\n...AND CON<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRegarding Mr. Lipschutz's article on<br />\nROTC, let me say that he is not only<br />\nmisinformed, but also proliferating<br />\nmisinformation. Rather than debate the entire<br />\nROTC issue with you, let me supply some<br />\ncorrections to his statements.<br />\nWhile Dean Swanson announced in the<br />\nSpring 1969 Johns Hopkins Magazine that ROTC<br />\n\"is regarded as an extracurricular activity,\" he<br />\nwas not speaking for the ROTC cadre. The fact is<br />\nthat Colonel Parmly has stated to me that ROTC<br />\nis not considered an extracurricular activity,<br />\nwhereas Pershing Rifles and the rifle team are.<br />\nAlso, no semantical distinctions can get around<br />\nthe fact that academic credit for ROTC is only<br />\nbeing phased out; that is, current MS l's will<br />\ncontinue to have ROTC grades averaged in until<br />\ntheir graduation, as will all those in classes ahead<br />\nof them.<br />\nGetting out of the advanced ROTC course<br />\nor refusing the commission the Army offers<br />\ngraduates is not as easy as you make it sound.<br />\nConversations with Colonel Parmly indicate that<br />\nthe Army has an easy time of unilaterally ending<br />\nthe scholarship contract, while the cadet must<br />\nmake a formal request to end it. The probability<br />\nof the request being allowed depends on the<br />\nArmy's need for men. A regular ROTC cad?t<br />\nfaces prosecution for violating a binding contract<br />\nor call up to active duty (he is in the reserves<br />\nalready). in the case that he refuses his<br />\ncommission.<br />\n'Continued on Pqe 1.5<br />\n.1<br />\n<br />\nit's your summer place for<br />\nall the going-gear S5 to $11<br />\nTo start, gather lots of cotton knit shirts<br />\nin stripes and solids; S, M, L, $5 to $6<br />\nAdd a pair \u2014 and a spare \u2014 of walk shorts in<br />\npick of solids, checks or plaids, $6 to $7<br />\nPlus tattersall-checked Farah Thins, $11<br />\nBoth in polyester-cotton; 31 to 36 waists.<br />\nVarsity Shop \u2014 all five stores<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br />\n<br />\nThat ROTC civilianizes the Army<br />\nis highly ,debatable. Those individuals<br />\nwho have tlle most serious doubts about<br />\nthe role of -the military in society or the<br />\neffects of an authoritarian organization<br />\non human consciences will certainly<br />\nshun military service. Thos ,individuals<br />\nwho develop serious misgivings about<br />\nthese things will be able to carry out<br />\ntheir duties unhindered only if they are<br />\ntruly extraordinary and hypocritical<br />\npeople. The clincher is that one of the<br />\nmost unequivocably militaristic<br />\npersonalities of this decade is a ROTC<br />\nproduct: General Curtis LeMay.<br />\nThe statement that \"45% of<br />\nsecond lieutenants are ROTC graduates\"<br />\nand \"that 65% of those trained for<br />\neventual promotion to general are<br />\nROTC graduates\" is false. The figures,<br />\naccording to Time(7 March 69)are 85%<br />\nof the second lieutenants and 33% of<br />\nthe generals. \"Underground\"<br />\nnewspapers generally agree with this<br />\n85% figure; and Colonel Parmly cited<br />\nthe figure of 80% to me in his office.<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nCorrespondence<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\nlanai/wed from .Page 14)<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nQuite frankly, a more fitting title<br />\nfor your article would have been<br />\n\"ROTC Defended: Clouding the<br />\nIssues.\"<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nBill Margrabe<br />\nGATE CHARGES<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nNews that a recent blue-ribbon<br />\ncommittee has recommended a gate<br />\ncharge for non-students at certain<br />\nathletic events at Hopkins comes as a<br />\nvery unwelcome shock.<br />\nThe committee which made the<br />\nrecommendation no doubt consulted<br />\nthe best evidence and the best advisors<br />\navailable in this area of athletic<br />\nadministration.

In an April letter to HEW Secretary Robert<br />\nFinch, President Gordon opposed this action as not<br />\nbeing applicable to the present situation. \"It is<br />\ndifficult,\" read the letter in part, \"for me to envisage a<br />\nsituation in which an individual could be guilty of<br />\nsufficiently serious disruptive action to warrant the<br />\napplication of these sanctions without at the same time<br />\nhaving his connection- with the University suspended or<br />\ntermina ted.\"<br />\nFederal Aid<br />\nThis feeling was echoed by Hopkins Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid, David Kaufman. According to Mr.<br />\nKaufman, if a student has done something so out of line<br />\n<br />\nthat he would ordinarily be dropped from the<br />\nUniversity, the \"underhanded method\" of withdrawing<br />\naid shouldn't be used as a \"weapon of punishment.\" If a<br />\nstudent is convicted of a crime, however, his federal aid<br />\nshould be automatically revoked. If he is not convicted,<br />\nit should be left up to the university to decide his fate.<br />\nThe Director stated that Hopkins espouses a<br />\n\"flexible\" philosophy of financial aid, and that since no<br />\ncases of this sort have come up, the University will have<br />\nto \"play it by ear.\" The decision is out of the<br />\nUniversity's hands, however, since the government can<br />\ncut off all aid to the students of any institution failing to<br />\ncomply with any Federal statute.<br />\nSome Positive Reactions<br />\nNot all reactions to the Nixon doctrine have been<br />\nnegative. The Board of Trustees of Cornell University<br />\nhas communicated to President Perkins that they expect<br />\nhim to implement their declaration that \"tactics of<br />\nterror\" would be met by \"firm and appropriate<br />\nresponse.\"<br />\nOne hundred and nine Memphis State University<br />\nstudents have been bound over for grand-jury action and<br />\nsuspended from school for staging a sit-in at the<br />\npresident's- office.

However.<br />\nNelson further stated , that employee wage<br />\nincreases are primarily ; responsible for the<br />\nheightened patient fees.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Nelson. the recent efforts to organize<br />\nnon-professional staff members by the National<br />\nOrganizing Committee of Hospital and Nursing Home<br />\nEmployees has not influenced the recent salary and wage<br />\nincreases.<br />\nFighting Poverty<br />\n<br />\nAs of July 1, the rates for hospital rooms will<br />\nincrease S6 to make daily rates $53 per room.

This rise is attributed to<br />\nthe changing Concept in medicine. \"Formerly the<br />\nphysician worked on a closer, personal basis whereas<br />\nnow with large, institutionalized care, there is no real<br />\nrapport between doctor and patient. This contributes to<br />\nmisunderstanding and misinterpretation on the part of<br />\nthe patient and his family,\" said Ventura.<br />\n<br />\nPunch \"hopes that Nelson will become more<br />\ncommunity responsive in alleviating the discrimination<br />\nin hiring and promoting Hopkins employees.

The latter represents an attempt to familiarize<br />\nsuburban Baltimoreans with the problems of the<br />\ninner-city and the ghetto black.<br />\nThe AWARE program concentrates its efforts on<br />\narranging speaking engagements before various Baltimore<br />\ncommunity organizations. If the drug information<br />\nprogram follows the lead of AWARE, similar speaking<br />\nengagements will probably be scheduled.<br />\nIn such an engagement, the community group is<br />\naddressed briefly by a student from the Hopkins<br />\norganization, and the floor is then opened to questions.<br />\nFrom all reports, the speakers from Hopkins have been<br />\nwell received.<br />\nAccording to Martin Hickey, Chairman of the new<br />\nS.A. program, the basic approach has not yet been<br />\ndetermined. At tomorrow's Steering Committee<br /><br />\nmeeting, three possible alternatives will be examined.<br />\nFirst, the speakeri from the organization might<br />\napproach the problem by comparing the effects of<br />\nmarijuana and other illicit drugs to those of alcohol. By<br />\nplacing these illegal drugs, about which there is a critical<br />\ndearth of knowledge, next to a familiar substance such<br />\nas alcohol, it is felt that many of the audience's<br />\nmisconceptions and distortions of fact might be<br />\neliminated.<br />\nThe second alternative which will be considered is<br />\nproviding the groups with a straight, factual account<br />\nregarding what is known about the effects of marijuana<br />\nand other drugs.<br />\nAgitation for Legislation<br />\nFinally, the group will consider a suggestion that it<br />\ndiscuss the current legislation pertaining to drug abuse.<br />\nAfter the suburban groups have been acquainted with<br />\nthe present status of these drugs under the law and the<br />\npenalties which accrue to users of these drugs, it has<br />\nbeen suggested that the speakers present a case for<br />\nmodification of the drug laws, and for rendering the<br />\npenalties for possession and use of the drugs more<br />\nrealistic. Only in this way, it is argued, can enough<br />\nsupport be mobilized for a change in the drug laws.<br />\nHickey's prediction is that the approach which is<br />\nfinally agreed upon will contain elements of all three<br />\nproposals. To bolster the program, he hopes to assemble<br />\na panel of physicians and lawyers, to assist in discussions<br />\non drugs and to render the presentations more effective.<br /><br />\n/CAMPUS NOTES\\ JHU Receives Grant<br />\nMARYLAND LACROSSE<br />\nWJHU, 830 kc, will transmit live<br />\nthe Lacrosse game between Hopkins and<br />\nU. of Maryland tomorrow.

Other<br />\nfunds will be donated by the university<br />\nand by the community-at-large. The goal<br />\nis for the University and the community<br />\ntogether to match the money given by<br />\nthe Ford Foundation. However, after an<br />\ninitial response of $125,000 by the<br />\ncommunity, Dr. Gordon admitted that<br />\nfund raising had been slower than<br />\nexpected. He said that this was<br />\nunderstandable, since it would be only<br />\nlogical to assume that before giving<br />\nmoney the community would want to<br />\nsee \"what they were buying.\"<br />\nDr. Sol Levine, currently professor<br />\nad Chairman of the Department of<br />\nBehavioral Sciences at the University's<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health,<br />\nwas appointed head of the center.<br />\nThree-Fold Purpose<br />\nThe purposes of the center,<br />\naccording to Dr. Levine, are three-fold:<br />\neducation,research, and consultation. He<br />\nstressed that the center would not,<br />\nunder any circumstances, administer<br />\nservice programs, such as welfare. Dr.<br />\nLevine does not see the center becoming<br />\nan \"ivory tower\" with no relevance to<br />\nthe community.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Levine, \"This<br />\ncenter is the first place where a real<br />\ndiscussion on urban problems can be<br />\nheld, and where the desperate need of<br />\nthe Baltimore city government for<br />\nexpert information, including all<br />\npossible implications of any proposed<br />\nproject can be obtained. It will also<br />\nprovide students and others an<br />\nopportunity to learn and attempt to<br />\ngain an understanding about urban<br />\nproblems. By performing these services<br />\nwe are playing an active role in the<br />\ncommunity, leaving the city government<br />\nas the implementer of any forthcoming<br />\nprojects.\"<br />\nThe center will have three<br />\ndifferent committees helping to guide its<br />\nactions. The Policy Board, composed of<br />\nUniversty officials, will decide major<br />\npolicy.

All three men noted that there are only ten<br />\nprofessors in the English Department and most of them<br />\nare heavily committed to the 40 graduate students in the<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nAll three men also pointed out that the<br />\nundergraduate interest in English has increased greatly<br />\nduring the past few years. Dr. Allen said that he used to<br />\nexpect no more than 15-20 students in his classes, but<br /><br />\nnow he often has 75 students in his Shakespeare classes.<br />\nDr. Hancher made this same point when he said that the<br />\ndepartment has to \"serve many more than its own<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nDr. Paulson listed several reasons for the acute<br />\nshortage of courses next semester. First,the department<br />\nhas been unable to find a replacement for Dr. Anderson<br />\nwho began teaching at Hopkins last fall. Second, the<br />\nadministration offered the department another assistant<br />\nprofessor, but it was too late to attract the kind of<br />\nquality professor that Hopkins demands. Finally, two<br />\nprofessors will be taking sabaticals next year for at least<br />\na semester.<br />\nImprovements Expected<br />\nDr. Paulson concluded that a number of<br />\nunfortunate circumstances all came together at the same<br />\ntime to cause next year's situation. He said that there are<br />\nsure to be some improvements in the undergraduate<br />\nofferings the year after next.<br />\nAll three English professors felt that the<br />\ndepartment was understaffed to meet the present<br />\ndemands of the undergraduate student body. Dr.<br />\nPaulson and Dr. Allen emphasized that the department<br /><br />\nhad to serve its graduate students first. Dr. Paulson said<br />\nthat the addition of at least one new professor in 1970<br />\nin addition to the replacement for Dr. Anderson would<br />\nbe some help. He also said that the department would<br />\nhave to make some effort to give more preference to<br />\nundergraduates even if this meant a minor slighting of<br />\nthe graduates. All three professors said that it would.<br />\nhelp if the size of the undergraduate demand could be<br />\ndecreased in some way.<br />\nDean Swanson also commented on the English<br />\nSituation and said that he had met with the entire<br />\nEnglish Department for the better part of an afternoon<br />\nto discuss the problems. He said that the English<br />\nprofessors regretted the situation but that they didn't<br />\nseem to have a concrete program for remedying the<br />\nsituation.<br />\nHe said the fact that four senior professors in<br />\nthe Department, Howard, Paulson, Wasserman and Miller<br />\nwere teaching no courses at all next year for<br />\nundergraduates showed \"a negligence in concern for the<br />\nundergraduates.\" He said that he regarded the problem<br />\nas a very serious situation which would have to be<br />\nimproved in the future.<br /><br />\nGordon Calls Undergraduate Body\"A Good Thing\"<br />\nBy EMIL PAVLOVICS<br />\nDr. Lincoln Gordon, at a<br />\nThursday panel discussion on \"Student<br />\nPower\" stated that he did not believe<br />\nstudents should have a direct voice in<br />\nformulating academic policy.<br />\nMr. Robert Bilgrave, director of<br />\nStudent Affairs, John Guess, President<br />\nof the Student Council and Gordon<br />\nwere the primary speakers at the meeting sponsored by a subcommittee<br />\nof the Student Council, the Academic<br />\nAffairs Committee.<br />\nThe three principal speakers<br />\ndelivered short opening remarks, then<br />\nfielded questions from the audience of<br />\napproximately 100 students.<br />\nPresident Gordon did not have the<br />\ntime to finalize his remarks, having just<br />\ncome from a meeting which took the<br />\nentire morning. Instead, he spoke from<br />\nnotes he had \"jotted down.\" The major<br />\ncontention which he hoped to<br />\nemphasize was that in a modern<br />\nuniversity, there neither is nor should<br />\nthere be \"a single decision-maker.\"<br />\nGordon felt that \"an<br />\nundergraduate body is a good thing for<br /><br />\na university.\" He was \"gratified\" that<br />\nstudents were seeking an active voice<br />\nwithin the University, and felt that<br />\nundergraduates were partners in the<br />\nUniversity \"junior partners to be sure,\"<br />\nbut partners nonetheless.<br />\nHe went on to speak of the<br />\nvarious categories of decisions within<br />\nthe University, explaining that for<br />\ncertain questions,.such as faculty hirings<br />\nand promotions, undergraduate<br />\ndecision-making really has no place.<br />\nThough he felt that long term planning<br />\nwas mainly a faculty and administrative<br />\nprocess, since they \"do have more of a<br />\nlong term stake in the University,\" the<br />\nPresident cited the \"arrangements made<br />\nthis year for student input.\" In student<br />\nextracurriculars, he pointed out that<br />\n\"most of the power lies in student<br />\nrepresentatives.\"<br />\nGordon explained that the best<br />\nmethod for true student representation<br />\nlies in the development of an<br />\nundergraduate voting system, truly<br />\nresponsive to the students, coordinated<br />\nwith the current committee machinery.<br />\nHe ended his opening remarks<br />\nwith the declaration that \"We have no<br />\nclosed doors.\"<br />\n(Continued on Page 12)<br /><br />\nwhere Bilgrave announced his<br />\nDr. Gordon and Robert Bilgrave at the \"Student Power\" discussion,<br />\nintention \"to speak in broad generalities\" and proceeded to do so.<br /><br />\nSwanson Claims \"Confusion\" With Gordon Over NUC Letter<br />\nDr.Carl Swanson, the associate dean of the<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences, stated this week<br />\nthat there had been \"confusion\" between his<br />\nOffice and the office of the president in regard<br />\nto the nature of his reply to the April 28 New<br />\nUniversity Conference letter sent to President<br />\nGordon.<br />\nDr. Gordon has repeatedly maintained that he<br />\nforwarded the NUC letter concerning the status ofROTC<br />\nto Dean Swanson for an \"official\" administration reply.<br />\nGordon told the News-Letter in an interview last<br />\nWednesday that \"The SDS letter had no signatures or<br />\nPost office box, no way of replying to it. The other<br />\nletter did get an official word back by Dean Swanson<br />\nWho was speaking in my name.\"<br />\nAlthough refusing to criticize Gordon's method of<br />\ninterstaff communications, Swanson stated that he never,<br />\nknew that his letter would be construed as the \"official<br /><br />\nword\" of the President. \"President Gordon asked Dean<br />\nKimball to ask me to reply to Dr. Pepper on the status<br />\nof ROTC.

The APL has recently been<br />\ncalled into question by the Johns Hopkins<br />\nChapter of the American Association of<br />\nUniversity Professors.<br />\nIn an unprecedented move, the Council passed a<br />\n\"general outline\" of its feelings which will serve as its<br />\nbasic philosophy for the coming academic year.<br />\nDeplorable Over-Reaction<br />\nThe resolution on the Homewood House<br />\nanti-ROTC demonstration stated that the SC \"Deplored<br />\nthe Administration's over-reaction and threat of<br />\n'suspension and appropriate action.' \"It continued in a<br />\ndifferent vein, holding that the SC hoped that \"in the<br />\nfuture, fellow students will refrain from unnecessary<br />\nconfrontations which, through their frequency, may lose<br />\ntheir effectiveness.\" The resolution was proposed by<br />\nManuel Rodriguez and passed by an 11-3 vote. In order<br />\nto follow up on the incident, an informal committee was<br />\norganized to investigate the events of May 6.<br />\nTwo years ago, the Hopkins chapter of the<br />\nAmerican Association of University Professors (AAUP)<br />\nappointed a Committee on Classified Research<br />\ncomprised of Drs. Barker, Rourke, Pevsner, and<br />\nHamburger. After a year of extensive study, the<br />\nCommittee issued a report containing these resolutions<br />\n(with Dr. Hamburger, Director of Barton Hall and<br />\nChairman of Electrical Engineering, dissenting). The<br />\nreport was presented to the AAUP in the hope that the<br />\nChapter would adopt the resolutions and submit them to<br />\nthe administration and Trustees of the University.<br />\nThe resolutions stated \"First, classified research,<br />\nand government security clearance, and serving the<br /><br />\narsenal function of government, are inappropriate<br />\noperations by the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\n\"Secondly, that the six continuing contracts<br />\nshould be terminated with deliberate speed, at the<br />\nearliest moment the contracts permit if possible, and in<br />\nany case not later than the minimum time needed to<br />\ntransfer personnel and equipment to unclassified work,<br />\nor to make other just arrangements.<br />\n\"Third, that these resolutions be transmitted by<br />\nthe President of the Chapter to the President and<br />\nTrustee's of the University.\"<br />\nAPL Special<br />\nAccording to Dr. Pevsner, the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory was not considered one of the six contracts<br />\nreferred to in the second resolution. Most of these six<br />\n:are<br />\nprojects which have already been terminated.<br />\nThe Committee included the following impression about<br />\nthe APL:<br />\n\"That the APL is special. Like Barton Hall it<br />\nderives from World War II research at Homewood. Its<br />\nremarkable work and growth present two tendencies the<br />\nChapter needs to recognize. (a) A splendid, maybe<br />\nunique, staff and faculty has been assembled. Though<br />\ndifficult it would be a grand achievement for Hopkins to<br />\nput that operation on a non-military footing.(b)On the<br />\nother hand the laboratory is 25 miles from Homewood,<br />\nand, again with the exception of Evening College work,<br />\nit is thoroughly separate from other Hopkins operations<br />\nin Physics and Engineering. This seems to raise a<br />\nquestion....whether or not the APL can properly remain<br />\na branch of the University.\"<br />\nThe Student Council, in response to the AAUP<br />\ncommittee's impressions on the APL,sent a letter to Dr.<br />\nGordon which asked him to join with them and<br />\nmembers of the AAUP in an administration- studentfaculty commission to decide whether it would be<br />\nfeasible to convert the APL to non-military research<br />\nwithin a reasonable time period,or whether the<br />\nUniversity should disassociate itself from the APL.<br />\nThe SC resolved unanimously that the commission<br />\nshould report publically no later than December 1,<br />\n1969. If the commission fails to meet or resolve to issue,<br /><br />\nthe SC will investigate other means of dealing with the<br />\nAPL problem.<br />\nBill Betcher's. \"New Philosophy for a Nov<br />\nHopkins\" resolution outlines three general goals for SC<br />\nthis<br />\naction during the coming year.

Mandel's Drug Law Called Unconstitutional<br />\n\"There are some serious constitutional questions<br />\nabout the 'Comprehensive Drug Abuse Control and<br />\nRehabilitation Act',\" stated Marvin Braiterman, former<br />\nchairman of the Maryland chapter of the American Civil<br />\nLiberies Union.<br />\nBraiterman contended that the new law \"may<br />\nviolate the due process and equal protection provisions\"<br />\nof the state and federal constitutions. Specifically: the<br />\ninclusion of marijuana users among drug addicts, the<br />\nprocedure by which a person is \"charged\", and<br />\nprovisions for incarcerating non-criminals with a rarely<br />\ncured illness, were suspected of being illegal.<br />\nSigned into law late last month by Governor<br />\nMarvin Mandel, the statute provides for the incarceration<br />\nof drug addicts for \"unspecified periods\" up to seven<br />\nyears. An addict is defined as one who \"exhibits the<br />\nsymptoms of physical and psychological dependence\"<br />\non any illegal drug.<br />\nIncarceration<br />\n\"Under the state of medical knowledge today,\"<br />\nexplained Braiterman, who headed the Maryland Civil<br />\nLiberties Union from 1965 through 1968,\"the fact that<br />\nthe provisions of the act could reach marijuana users<br />\nmakes it suspect. In addition, the state impliedly<br />\npromises large scale efforts at rehabilitation of drug<br />\naddicts as thequid pro quo for incarceration, even<br />\nthough such incarceration doesn't have to be preceded<br />\nby any kind of criminal offense.<br /><br />\nHowever, everything we know about treatment of<br />\ndrug addicts\u2014especially those hard core addicts who are<br />\ninvolved in the crime problem\u2014indicated that treatment<br />\nis usually unsuccessful. The statute can't make drug<br />\naddiction a crime as such, so it treats it as a medical<br />\nproblem\u2014which it is. But how can it allow involuntary<br />\nimprisonment for an illness which is in many respects<br />\nnot able to be treated successfully.<br />\n\"Then there are many procedural questions that<br />\nare raised in the act. The whole business of how a person<br />\nbecomes 'charged' under the act\u2014by a judge, by a<br />\nmember of his family, or practically by anyone...Once a<br />\nperson is adjudged a drug addict and comes under the<br />\nclutches of this legislation, he is in real trouble, and will<br />\nstay in trouble for years.<br />\nMythology and Fantasy<br />\n\"Not only that, but the whole concept of a drug<br />\naddict is more tightly linked to a lot of mythology and<br />\nfantasy about drug use and abuse than to the actual state<br />\nof scientific and medical knowledge. The language of the<br />\nlaw makes a pretense of being medical, but I think that<br />\nits motivation is very punitive and political.<br />\n\"It may,\" Braiterman conjectured, \"be a grab-bag<br />\nof civil liberties transgressions. Yet, if it appeared that<br />\nthe law proceeded from generous, humane, or social<br />\nconcern, wc might wink at the constitutional<br />\ndeficiencies involved.

The average income of a<br />\ngrape worker in Delano is $2,024,<br />\n$1476 below the national \"poverty<br />\nline.\" Area growers claim that by<br />\nproviding housing for the workers, they<br />\nmiligate many of the workers' financial<br />\ndi fficul ties.<br />\nThe strike was organized by<br />\nMexican-American amd Filipino grape<br />\npickers in 1965, in order to gain<br />\nrecognition of rights accorded them by<br />\nfederal law. The main issue then and<br />\nnow is the right to collective<br /><br />\nbargaining. SES and SNCC originally<br />\nworked in conjunction with the union<br />\nbut discontinued their work due to<br />\ndisparities between union aims and<br />\nradical concerns.<br />\nIn mid-1966 the union joined the<br />\nAFL-CIO as the United Farm Workers<br />\nOrganizing Committee (UFWOC), in an<br />\neffort to gain support from a strong<br />\nnational organization while retaining a<br />\ndegree of autonomy. The strategy was<br />\nnot succesful, however, since the parent<br />\nunion had to support certain liberal<br />\npoliticians, such as Pat Brown, who<br />\nbacked the growers. Recently the<br />\nOrganizing Committee has drawn<br />\npoliticians with ties to labor as well as<br />\nradicals throughout the nation.<br />\nThe initial strike was called<br />\nagainst wine grape growers and was<br />\nsettled, to a large extent, by 1967, when<br />\nan attack was launched against the<br />\nHuimarra Vineyards Corporation, the<br />\nworld'sp largest producer of table<br />\ngrapes. The company was immediately<br />\nable to replace the strikers with \"scab\"<br />\nlaborers from Mexico, who entered<br />\nCalifornia on temporary visas.<br />\nGrowers React<br />\nIn august, 1967, the union called<br />\nfor a nationwide boycott of Guimarra's<br /><br />\nproducts. The boycott spread to include<br />\nall California grapes when Guimarra<br />\nbegan to ship its products under the<br />\nlabels of cooperating growers from<br />\nother parts of the state. The growers<br />\ncountered by labelling their products<br />\n\"Arizona grapes\" and thus the boycott<br />\nwas expanded to encompass all grapes<br />\nproduced in the United States.<br />\nLast year the growers lost ten to<br />\ntwenty per cent of their sales because of<br />\nthe boycott, but their profits were not<br />\nseriously affected. In an attempt to<br />\ndestroy the union, the growers started a<br />\n\"front\" union that opposed Chavez and<br />\nthe UFWOC. The formation of such<br />\nunions is against -a federal law that<br />\nprohibits employers from organizing<br />\nemployees. The attempt was exposed to<br />\nthe Labor Department in March by two<br />\nformer leaders of the \"front\" union.<br />\nThey told the Department \"We were to<br />\ntell workers not to be afraid of Chavez,<br />\nto be united, and we as an organization<br />\nwould support and protect workers We<br />\nwere to oppose UFWOC attempts to<br />\norganized<br />\nLarge chain stores have not been<br />\nreceptive to the grape boycott. Members<br />\nof the boards of directors of many chain<br />\nsupermarkets also have interest in the<br />\ngrape growing business, and therefore<br /><br />\nare reluctant to submit to consumer<br />\npressure.<br />\nFederal law prohibits a secondarY<br />\nstrike against transporting scab grapes.<br />\nTherefore, fellow members of the<br />\nAFL-CIO cannot support the boycott..<br />\nFederal immigration policy also has<br />\npermitted widespread importation of<br />\nMexican labor to prevent a crisis among<br />\nthe growers. Chavez charges that these<br />\nimmigrants come \"in buses provided bY<br />\ngrowers and escorted by local<br />\npolice.\"<br />\nConflicto de Labor\"<br />\nThe law does require employers to<br />\ninform the Mexicans that they will h,e<br />\nbreaking a strike, but this is<br />\ncircumvented by telling them of 3<br />\n\"c onflicto de labor\" rather than<br />\n\"huelga\"(strike).<br />\nThe California Department of<br />\nLabor hinders the strike by referring<br />\nworkers seeking employment to fields<br />\nthat have been struck. The California<br />\neducational system also supports the<br />\ngrowers by purchasing grapes for the<br />\nfood services in the state's colleges. Oil<br />\nall state campuses in California except<br />\nthe University of California at BerkeleY<br />\nthe grapes are served. Various members<br />\nof the California Board of Regents have<br />\nbusiness in the grape growing industry.<br /><br />\nHopkins Uses Quasi-Endowments to Balance Budget<br />\nPresident Gordon said in a meeting with<br />\nstudents- on Tuesday that the Arts and Sciences<br />\n-division of the University had to borrow into<br />\n$2.6 million of Hopkins quasi-endowment fund<br />\nto balance the 1968-69 budget terminating on<br />\nJune 31.<br />\nThe University's fund, presently including<br />\nendowments legally forbidden for budgetary<br />\npurposes,totals $56 million, the President estimated. The<br />\n$2.6 million transfer was the first time such funds were<br />\nused to balance Hopkins budget in the memory of many<br />\nadministrators.

The American<br />\nAssociation of University Professors placed Hopkins<br />\ntenth in the 1968-69 fiscal year in salaries and fringe<br />\nbenefits of American colleges and universities.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins was ninth last year in this<br />\ncategory, Gordon claimed, \"substantial improvements in<br />\n'salaries and other budgetary items\" were made this fiscal<br />\nyear. He estimated that there would be a 9 per cent<br />\nincrement in faculty compensations in the 1969-70<br />\nbudget in its final stages of completion.<br />\nThe A.A.U.P. cited Harvard, California Institute<br />\nof Technology, University of Chicago and City College<br />\nof New York as,the top-paying institutions in decending<br /><br />\norder. Hopkins' salaries roughly equate to those of Yale<br />\nand Cornell.

The greatest source for<br />\nthe expanded budget was the government. Payments<br />\nfrbm Washington increased from $10 million to $40<br />\nmillion over this time period. Private grants, private gifts<br />\nand endowments have remained constant over this<br />\nperiod. Revenues gained through tuition have expanded<br />\nfrom $4 million from 1959-1968. Tuitions, though, have<br />\nremained the same in their percentage of the budget's<br />\nrevenue.<br />\nResearch Increase<br />\nNaturally, the great increase over the years in<br />\nexpenditures has been in sponsored research and<br />\ntraining. Such research has jumped from $10-$35 million<br />\nin 9 years. Student Aid has decreased in this time period<br />\nin a percentage of the budget. Hopkins' 1967-68 budget,<br />\nthe latest year it has presently been tabulated, totaled<br />\n$67.1 million, excluding the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory. This was a $6.5 million increase over the<br />\nprevious year.<br />\nExpenditures in the Arts and Science division of<br />\nthe University increased from S10 million to $26 million<br />\nin the nine-year period. The greatest divisional boosts<br />\nwere in Medicine.

Rather than attempting<br />\nto delineate in detail particular grievances at this time, this resolution may be considered as<br />\na general outline of the Council's feelings. Certainly not all of the Council's actions will fit<br />\ndirectly within this framework, hut every action will inevitably be over-shadowed by these<br />\nthoughts. We urge the students at Hopkins, as well as faculty members and administrators,<br />\nto carefully consider the following:<br />\nFirst, the Council stands firmly for increased consideration for the undergraduate at<br />\nHopkins. For too long the undergraduate has been relegated by the faculty and the<br />\nadministration to an inferior position in the scale of priorities, following such goals as the<br />\npursuit of scholarly research and the improvement of graduate departments. While we do<br />\nnot question the wisdom of the University in pursuing these other goals, such efforts should<br />\nno longer unduly infringe upon attempts to better the quality of the undergraduate's<br />\nenvironment and academic opportunities. The undergraduate's demand for greater<br />\nconsideration is rendered all the more urgent by the University's historic tendency to<br />\nneglect him and by the current atmosphere, at campuses throughout the nation, of<br />\nrestlessness for change and willingness to use the tactics of confrontation and force.<br />\nSecond, in view of the University's apparent reluctance to assign a higher priority to<br />\nHopkins undergraduates, the Council feels strongly that structural changes must be made in<br />\nthe University's decision-making processes to insure the undergraduate a more effective<br />\nvoice in University policy. We do not seek power for power's sake, but rather power as a<br />\nmeans to achieve an equitable role in decisions that affect the undergraduate. To continue<br />\nto neglect reasonable student requests for consultation and fair representation would be to<br />\nignore the growing nation-wide trend in universities towards liberalization of the<br />\ndecision-making mechanisms, and would invite hostile student reactions, serving only to<br />\nfurther widen the gap between students, faculty, and administrators.<br />\nThirdly, in addition to Structural changes, the Council calls for a more open attitude<br />\non the part of faculty and administrators. Accessibility and receptiveness to student views<br />\nmust replace the closed doors and ears so characteristic of the past. The University must be<br />\nwilling to broaden the channels of communications, both formally and informally, if the<br />\naverage student is to feel an integral and respected member of the University community,<br />\nrather than an alienated pawn of the decision-makers. Better communications would serve<br />\nthe University community in two fundamental ways: by informing all parties of student<br />\nfeelings and ideas, and by bridging the gap of mis-information and suspicion between<br />\nstudents, faculty, and administrators.<br />\nFinally, the Council advocates a thorough re-examination, open to all segments of the<br />\nUniversity community, of the guiding philosophy of the University, and we feel that<br />\nUniversity policy should be made consistent with this new philosophy.<br />\nThe Student Council calls upon their fellow undergraduates to actively and<br />\nresponsibly unite behind these goals; and to the administration and to the faculty we say:<br />\nignorance of student feeling can no longer be the basis for inaction.<br /><br />\nSigned,<br />\nTHE STUDENT COUNCII<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\nThe Quote of the Week:<br /><br />\nMir<br /><br />\nNM\"TS<br /><br />\nratter<br /><br />\nRICHARD CRAMER.PETER HARNIK<br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nGEORGE JOHNSTON,KEVIN KRESOCK<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nSTEPHEN TULLOSS<br />\nManaging Editor<br /><br />\nAdolph Hitler<br />\nHamburg, Germany 1932<br /><br />\nDAVID HOELSCHER<br />\nNews Director<br /><br />\nOn a Sour Notemfarwell<br />\nThe highly touted Committee on Student Relations has been a pretty<br />\nslimy affair from the start. Many facts were brought to light by the recent<br />\nresignation of Larry Campbell, who was serving as a representative of the<br />\nundergraduate student body on the Committee. The more one learns<br />\nabout the Committee's structure and operations, the hollower ring the<br />\nwords of Dr. Gordon and Company.<br />\nMany months ago, when we students were seeking representation on<br />\nthe Academic Council, for the first time, the adminsitration sought \u2022to<br />\nallay ow fears that we weren't being heard, by forming this Committee to<br />\nadvise and report to the faculty Council. From that time forth, every<br />\ncomplaint which the students voiced about their role in policy making at<br />\nHopkins, was answered with a glowing report of this Committee's<br />\nProgress.<br />\nThe most recent example of this rosy rhetoric was found (of all<br />\nplaces) on the pages of the Baltimore Sun. Dr. Gordon wrote a letter to<br />\nthe editor, denying the charge that he is against giving students a role in<br />\nthe university's policy decisions. To heighten the effect of the denial, Dr.<br />\nGordon dusted off some of the rhetoric about our community of scholars<br />\nat Hopkins and the manner in which we are beating back the frontiers of<br />\nknowledge. The same polysyllables which his students have recently<br />\nceased to accept were much in evidence in the columns of the Sun. In his<br />\nletter, Dr. Gordon intimated that the Committee on Student Relations lay<br />\nat the crux of the students' power to influence university decisions. He<br />\nproudly stated that the Committee was composed of faculty,<br />\nadministration and students. As we are finding out however, many of the<br />\nmost pertinent facts concerning the Committee have never been seen in<br />\nprint.<br />\nLet us examine, for instance, the manner in which the student<br />\n\"representatives\" were chosen for duty on this important body. Dean<br />\nKimball demanded that two undergraduates and two graduate students be<br />\nchosen to serve on the Committee. Dean Swanson drew the assignment of<br />\ndetermining who the two undergraduates would be. According to the<br />\nlatter, his next step was to request that Russell Passarella select two of his<br />\npeers. However, either Passarella did not hear correctly, or else he was<br />\nnever asked, because he had no part in the process of selection. Dean<br />\nSwanson ended up choosing the two arbitrarily, picking two students<br />\nwhom he knew slightly and reasoning that they would be as representative<br />\nas anyone else he could have chosen. Dean Swanson said, \"I didn't give it<br />\nmuch thought.\" Passarella and the rest of the undergraduate body learned<br />\nidentities of the representatives nearly three weeks after they were named.<br />\nWhen Dr. Swanson heard that Passarella denied ever being asked to<br />\nname two representatives, his memory clouded with exceptional speed. In<br />\nhis first statement he was quite certain that he had spoken to Passarella.<br />\nLess than an hour later, he could barely remember the incident at all.<br />\nMoreover, the Dean was unable to see why such a matter would be of<br />\nconcern to undergraduates at all. He told a News-Letter reporter that the<br />\npaper could print anything it wanted;\"It won't affect me,\" he concluded.<br /><br />\nFEAu-nput,<br /><br />\n\"The streets of our country arc in turmoil. The<br />\nUniversities are filled with students rebelling and rioting.<br />\nCommunists are seeking to destroy our country. Russia is<br />\nthreatening us with her might. And the republic is in<br />\ndanger. Yes, danger from within and without. We need law<br />\nand order! Yes, without law and order our nation cannot<br />\nsurvive.\"<br /><br />\nATTRACTED<br />\nTO<br />\nK)<br /><br />\nA<br />\nATTPACTD<br />\nISI-10H121,-S-<br /><br />\nThis kind of behavior is common to Hopkins, but very uncommonly<br />\nfound in Dean Swanson. One gets the impression that despite the fact that<br />\nhe is a member of Hopkins' administration, he is not in the least afraid or<br />\ndisdainful of undergraduates. It almost seems, at times, that he wishes he<br />\nwere twenty years old, and on the offensive against hypocracy. So when<br />\none sees him acting hypocritical and defensive, one knows that things have<br />\nsunk to a low ebb.<br />\nAnd although discouraging, what is left in the wake of Dean<br />\nSwanson's enthusiasm and Dr. Gordon's rhetoric is illuminating. The<br />\nfunction of this Committee was to advise the Academic Council on<br />\nmatters which are of interest to students. Thus, it was to be the<br />\nlong-heralded \"input\" promised to students. According to the members of<br />\nthe group, however, this is not the function which will be carried out. The<br />\nCommittee is acting primarily as a fact-finding team for the parent body.<br />\nThe Committee will attempt to advise, in the words of ope member, only<br />\nif it feels strongly enough about the issue involved. The concensus seems<br />\nto be that the fact-finding function of the group will generally take<br />\nprecedence over (perhaps to the exclusion of) its advisory capacity.<br /><br />\nAnother revealing fact about the Committee is the, stand which it<br />\ntook on the \"openness\" of its own meetings. A reporter was able to ferret<br />\nout the time and location of one of the meetings (for maximum security,<br />\nit was held in Dr. McElroy's office). He found, however, that the<br />\nCommittee needed to debate whether or not it would allow him to<br />\nobserve. He was asked to leave the room and when he was readmitted, he<br />\nfound that he was perfectly free to be present in any Meeting. That is, in<br />\nany meeting except those during which the Committee is discussing<br />\n\"substantive matters\" (i.e., anything important). In other words, the<br />\nCommittee does not want the students to get in the way while it<br />\nrepresents them.<br />\nHere we have, then, an apt vehicle for conveying student opinion up<br />\nto the perches of the Hopkins elite. This is what we are offered in place of<br />\nfull representation. Undergraduates owe a debt of gratitude to Larry<br />\nCampbell for exposing that which previously had been obscured by<br />\nrhetoric and bureaucratic jibberish. In itself, his resignation was not<br />\ntremendously significant. As a committee member, his effect on decisions<br />\nof the university would have been negligible anyway. What is significant<br />\nis that this year began and ended with the same promises of increased<br />\ncommunication between those who make the decisions and those whom<br />\nthe decisions affect. This year, as in previous years, little progrss was made<br />\ntoward rendering the promise a tangible fact. Undergraduates meet with<br />\nresistance and secrecy from Homewood House. Dean Swandon's actions as<br />\nmentioned above is a perfect example of the administration maxim, \"If<br />\nthe students might be angered over something, keep it secret until we are<br />\nsure that they have forgotten.\" However, this maxim is rapidly loosing its<br />\neffectiveness. Students remember more and more , as the administration<br />\nat Hopkins is due to find out. If Lincoln Gordon continues talking about<br />\nopenning \"broad avenues of communication,\" he cannot continue fending<br />\nstudents off with what must be called \"back alley\" tactics.<br /><br />\n[{)T<br /><br />\nHA1,750HE<br /><br />\nTI-IE<br />\nPPOE31.61/14)(<br />\nWITH<br />\nEQUALITY<br />\n1E-77,0E-6N<br />\n-THE<br />\n56}CES -<br /><br />\nl't11111.1tels 11.111 ,11,114.4it 199<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nIS YOU<br />\nHAVE<br />\nTO RE<br />\n6DTit-OAP6P<br />\nKFOPE<br />\nIT<br />\nAF17 165<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 10<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br /><br />\nPaton's Long View on Apartheid<br />\nBy CHERRY MICHELMAN<br />\nAlthough he lives isolated in a tragic land, Alan<br />\nPaton is a fortunate man. He is an artist surrounded by<br />\nan endless supply of artistically exploitable material,<br />\nwhose moral perspective is consistent and clear, and for<br />\nwho writing is a form of social as well as artistic<br />\ndedication. As a white, English-speaking South African<br />\nliving in the province of Natal, where he was born,<br />\nPaton's sympathies lie with the aspirations of the<br />\nsocially and politically repressed non-whites. Paton was<br />\nan architect and National Chairman of South Africa's<br />\nLiberal Party, which stands for racial equality, universal<br />\nsuffrage, and and open society in a land which considers<br />\nracial equality a threat and liberalism an accusation.<br />\nFor more than\". twenty years, the Afrikaners,<br />\nwhite, Dutch-speaking descendants of the Boer farmers,<br />\nhave controlled the South African government. Their<br />\nNationalist Party objectives have been to vindicate the<br />\nAfrikaner history, to exalt Afrikaner nationlaism, and to<br />\nestablish and buttress Afrikaner political control. Their<br />\nsocial program, variously called \"Apartheid\", \"Separate<br />\nDevelopment\", \"Baasskap\", and \"White Supremacy\",<br />\nhas been a system of iron laws controlling the political,<br />\neconomic, and social life of South Africa's non-whites.<br />\nBy law, the blacks have been reduced to the status<br />\nof imigrants who may sell their labor in white, urban<br />\nareas, but who can enjoy civil rights only in their<br />\nhomelands, the native reserves, which they may never<br />\nhave seen. By law, families are shattered, educational<br />\nopportunities are whittled down, jobs are denied, and<br />\nhopes are destroyed.. The Afrikaners tell the Africans,<br />\nfive million of whom are de-tribalized, urbanized and<br />\nWestern value-oriented, to go back to tribalism and be<br />\nhappy, and not to seek to become \"imitation<br />\nEuropeans.\"<br />\nAfrikaner consolidation of political control has<br />\nrendered the million English-speaking _whites nearly<br />\npowerless politically. But few of them oppose Apartheid<br />\nas a social goal. They quarrel over its legal structures.its<br />\nseverity, its methods, but seldom with its necessity. The<br />\nLiberals, who are almost without exception<br />\nEnglish-speaking, are not powerful enough today to<br />\nreturn even one representative to Parliament. They are<br />\ndespised, suspected and persecuted by the Government.<br />\nMany of their leaders live under banning orders which<br />\ndeprive them of freedom of speech, movement, and<br />\nassembly.<br />\nSad But Unafraid<br />\nNevertheless, the party remnants, however<br />\nembattled, speak clearly and courageously against the<br /><br />\ninhumanity and injustice of Apartheid. They are the<br />\nconscience of the country afraid of its own future and<br />\nwhich justifies its policies by proclaiming its fear. In a<br />\nland where nearly everyone is afraid of something, of the<br />\nGovernment's displeasure if not of the coming<br />\nholocaust, Alan Paton is a saddened but unfrightened<br />\nspokesman for Liberalism. He has not been silenced by<br />\nthe Government, perhaps because his novels enjoy a<br />\nworld-wide reputation, and the Government dislikes<br />\ninternational criticism even more than domestic dissent.<br />\nIn 1968, Paton published a volume of essays, The<br />\nLong View, which represent ten years of his political<br />\nconcerns and his philosophical reflections of and in<br />\nthem. These essays were originally written for his regular<br />\ncolumn, also called \"The Long View\", in Contact, the<br />\nmagazine produced by the Liberal Party until it was<br />\nsilenced by Government decree in 1964.<br />\nNot God's Will<br />\nThe essays deal with the abuse of power, the cost<br />\nof dissent, the spiritual despair as the cost of adversity.<br />\nHe examines the Christian conscience as it affects and is<br />\naffected by South African life. Afrikaners have advanced<br />\nand justified their national aims as the will of God,<br />\nregarding themselves as the instrument of Providence.<br />\nPaton, himself a believing Christian, points out the<br />\ndanger inherent in the idea that one is the chosen<br />\ninstrument of God's will. Mindful of the excesses of the<br />\nInquisition, of Calvin, of Hitler, he suggests that Dr.<br />\nVerwoerd avoid these paranoid claims and concentrate<br />\non the revealed will of God which enjoins man to \"Do<br />\njustice, love mercy, and walk humbly.\"<br />\nQuestioning the claims of Afrikaner Christian<br />\nNationalism, Paton says: \"In my humble view, there is<br />\nonly one way in which a religious politician may<br />\napproach the question of God's will. He will do so<br />\nhumbly, not claiming to know what that will is, but will<br />\ntry to live his life in obedience to the great and small<br />\ncommandments, notably those which command him to<br />\nlove God and his neighbor.\"<br />\nThis may sound like routine theology anywhere<br />\nbut South Africa. There it rings with tragic irony. Paton<br />\nmust plead with a lonely voice for that sounds to anyone<br />\nremoved from the South African conflict like a political<br />\ncliche: \"No law is good that harms people.\" He speaks<br />\nto those he terms \"nice Christians\", who feel no qualms<br />\nof morality or logic in saying, \"I have scome to believe<br />\nthat we must have apartheid with as little brutality as<br />\npossible.\"<br />\nIn his description of Robert Kennedy's South<br />\nAfrican tour in 1965 Paton again demonstrates how the<br /><br />\nstatement of the liberal faith, which may sound<br />\nunremarkable to any Western audience, sounded<br />\nexciting, exhilarating, daring, like a fresh wind from a<br />\nwider world. In noting that Kennedy was accused of<br />\nhaving gone to South Africa to benefit himself<br />\npolitically, Paton observes that if Prime Minister<br />\nVerwoerd could benefit himself politically by going<br />\nabroad, he would do so, if he could find a country to go<br />\nto.<br />\nNo Revolution<br />\nKennedy's five-day visit to South Africa was a very<br />\nbrief respite from the frustration and despair of the<br />\nembattled liberals there. There is little hope that the<br />\nGovernment will reverse its policies. Opposition is<br />\nincreasingly silenced. Even the declared enemies of<br />\nApartheid do not look forward to a revolution of the<br />\nnon-whites or to armed intervention from outsiders.<br />\nThey have no near prospect of a solution, nothing<br />\nconcrete to hope for.<br />\nIn this sad circumstance, perhaps the most moving<br />\nof the essays in this collection, which includes<br />\nthoughtful portraits of Cheif Albert Luthuli, of Dr.<br />\nVerwoerd, of Father Trevor Huddleston (the deported<br />\nAnglican priest,) is \"Beware of Melancholy\". In it, he<br />\ndescribes the ominous future he sees for those who<br />\ncontinue to dissent. To the hardest of questions, \"Is it<br />\nworth trying to last?\", he gives the humble answer, \"I<br />\ndon't know.\"<br />\nSomeone once characterized a liberal as \"a man<br />\nwith both feet firmly planted in mid-air.\" In the<br />\namplification of his answer, Paton glorifies that stance:<br />\n\"If someone were to ask me,'What would you and your<br />\nwife do if you had young children?', I would answer,<br />\n'We would have two choices: to stay here and give our<br />\nchildren a father and mother who put some things above<br />\ntheir own children's safety and happiness, or to leave<br />\nand to give them a father and mother who put their<br />\nchildren's safety and happiness above all else.' Which<br />\nwould I choose? They are both good choices, are they<br />\nnot? I hope I would choose the first.\"<br />\nIn the beginning of this article, I called Alan Paton<br />\na fortunate man. Fortunate does not mean happy. A<br />\nman who is sensitive to suffering can never be happy in<br />\nthe midst of suffering. A man who loves freedom cannot<br />\nbe happy among those deprived of freedom. Paton has<br />\nsomething even more important to his spiritual and<br />\nartistic fulfillment - a searing vision of what is right and<br />\nought to be. He considers this to be luck: \"Life has<br />\ntaught me - and this is my luck - that active loving saves<br />\none from morbid preoccupation with the shortcomings<br />\nof society.\"<br /><br />\nOur American Heritage<br />\nGeorge McClellan Over Barry Goldwater<br /><br />\nby ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThere is a fair amount of<br />\nconfusion as to the intent of General<br />\nGeorge B. McClellan's campaign for<br />\nPresident in 1864. The primary sources<br />\nconcerning this campaign compound,<br />\nrather than dispel, the confusion. There<br />\nare McClellan broadsides and campaign<br />\nsongs indicating that the General desired<br />\nimmediate conciliation of the South.<br />\nEqually good material indicated.<br />\nthat the General intended to prosecute<br />\nthe war and was in emotional agony lest<br />\nthe sacrifices of the first four years be in<br />\nvain.<br />\nOne of the chief difficulties is that<br />\nGeneral 'McClellan was not one of the<br />\nprime movers in his own nomination.<br />\nHe was not indifferent to the honor,<br />\nsome commentators considered<br />\nMcClellan and the Democratic platform<br />\nan anomalous combination, \"a war<br />\nDemocrat on a peace platform.\"<br />\nIndeed, McClellan's chief<br />\nadvantages as a candidate were that he<br />\nwas nationally well known and (unlike<br />\nHoratio Seymour, who ran third for the<br />\nnomination) could not have his record<br />\ndistorted into tacit sympathy with the<br />\nConfederacy.<br />\nCrackling Broadside<br />\nThe Democratic platform went as<br />\nfar toward conciliation as would be<br />\nreasonably possible without advocating<br />\nrecognition of the Confederacy. The<br />\nplatform did not resemble the wordy,<br />\nturgid concoctions of today. It was a<br />\ncrackling campaign broadside which<br />\ndisplayed little enthusiasm to pursue the<br />\nwar. A fast settlement on the basis of<br /><br />\nthe Union of the states was<br />\nrecommended.<br />\nThere were also criticisms of<br />\nPresident Lincoln's administration for<br />\nthe use of troops in loyal states and<br />\nrestrictions on wartime civil liberties.<br />\nCertain of the criticisms were<br />\noverstated, but there was a definite case<br />\nto be made.<br />\nBetray the Troops<br />\nGeneral McClellan's letter of<br />\nacceptance is not antagonistic to the<br />\nDemocratic platform, but it does<br />\nreorder the emphasis concerning certain<br />\npoints. McClellan stressed that no<br />\nsettlement could recognize the<br />\nConfederacy; he implied that such a<br />\ncapitulation would betray the troops<br />\nwhom he had led through several<br />\ncampaigns.<br />\nOn the other hand, he stressed<br />\nthat the South should have to concede<br />\nnothing beyond its status as a separate<br />\nrepublic. He said,\"The Union is the one<br />\ncondition of peace we ask no more.\"<br />\nThis indicates that the Emancipation<br />\nProclamation, which as promulgated by<br />\nMr. Lincoln, applied only to areas in<br />\nrebellion, would not be part of a peace<br />\nsettlement.<br />\nNo more Vietnams<br />\nHowever, it does appear that the<br />\ndifferences between the McClellan and<br />\nLincoln policies were not as great as<br />\nthey are sometimes represented. Neither<br />\nwas willing to recognize the existance of<br />\nthe Confederacy. But Mr. Lincoln,<br />\nnotwithstanding the Emancipation<br />\nProclamation, never indicated a belief in<br />\na radical peace settlement.<br /><br />\nIn this year, the Republicans tried<br />\nto fudge their sectional character by<br />\ncalling their convention the National<br />\nUnion Convention and sending forth<br />\nAndrew Johnson the slaveholding<br />\nTennessee Democrat, as Mr. Lincoln's<br />\nrunning mate. It will be remembered<br />\nthat, as late as the Hampton Roads<br />\nconference of February 8, 1865, Mr.<br />\nLincoln proposed a settlement which is<br />\nconsonant with the spirit of General<br />\nMcClellan's acceptance letter.<br />\nThis is not to say that American<br />\nhistory would be about the same if Mr.<br />\nMcClellan had won the election. For the<br />\nmost important point, there would be<br />\nno Lincoln legend. Lincoln would be<br />\nremembered as a dark-horse candidate<br />\nfor President who could not muster<br />\ntwo-fifths of the popular vote in his<br />\nelection, who was powerless to stop the<br />\nUnion from crumbling immediately<br />\nafterwards, and who could conceive of<br />\nno more imaginative solution than a war<br />\nof attrition between sections. His defeat<br />\nfor re-election would be regarded as the<br />\ncrowning piece to four years of failure.<br />\nRealm of Possibility<br />\nIt is also true that the Democrats<br />\nwere generally identified in the public<br />\nmind with peace. McClellan would not<br />\nhave wanted to settle hurriedly, but as a<br />\nDemocrat, elected in protest to Lincoln,<br />\nhe would have been under intense<br />\npressure to make a fast settlement. That<br />\nthe Confederacy would have received<br />\nattractive concessions, and perhaps even<br />\na degree of autonomy, must be<br />\nconsidered within the realm of<br /><br />\npossibility.<br />\nIn the early stages of the election,<br />\nit appeared that McClellan might win.<br />\nRepublican managers in Congress were<br />\nso agonized that they admitted Nevada<br />\nto the Union in order to assure<br />\nthemselves of three more electoral<br />\nvotes. President Lincoln committed an<br />\nact fully equal to those which met the<br />\nopprobrium of the Democratic platform<br />\nwriters. He organized furloughs for<br />\nsoldiers so that they could vote for<br />\nhim.(There was an element of risk in<br />\nthis, since McClellan, who certainly<br />\ndidn't overwork his soldiers, had been<br />\nconsidered wildly popular among them.<br />\nHowever, in 1864 the soldier vote was<br />\nfairly solid for Lincoln).<br />\nDistortion of Votes<br />\nHowever, the election was not<br />\nreally in doubt after General Sherman<br />\nentered Atlanta in late September. The<br />\npopular vote was not an emphatic<br />\nmandate of epic proportions. General<br />\nMcClellan, however, carried only three<br />\nstates. He carried slaveholding Delaware<br />\nand Kentucky and also New Jersey,<br />\nwhere he was residing, and which was<br />\nthe only free state to give electoral votes<br />\nto an opponent of Mr. Lincoln in 1860.<br />\nAs in 1860, any distortion of the<br />\npopular vote in the Electoral College<br />\nwas entirely to Mr. Lincoln's benefit.<br />\nThe electoral vote was 212 to 21. As in<br />\n1812, an attempt to defeat a President<br />\nfor re-election in the midst of war<br />\n(repeated with equal lack of success in<br />\n1944) had failed.<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nAnti-Feature Scores Anti-Fiction<br />\nBy LEO MANGLAVITI<br />\nAnti-novel is not a derogatory term. Neither is<br />\nantifilm or anti-play. All three share the element of<br />\nanti-fiction, a rendering of both real and fictional<br />\nworlds, with reminders to the viewer of each aspect.<br />\nWhenever the artist stops his imaginative action and<br />\naddresses his audience with a \"dear reader\" scene, he<br />\ninterrupts his fiction and exposes his work as mere<br />\nimitation of reality. But the success of this technique,<br />\nancient in the arts, is based on its valid result: not to<br />\ndestroy the fictional world but invite the viewer into a<br />\nmore intimate sharing of it.<br />\nOne can easily spend an after-exams, anti-fictional<br />\n(no pun) weekend in New York. Go to bookstores and<br />\nbuy Richard Brautigan to read in the afternoons, and go<br />\nto see Warhol's \"Lonesome Cowboys,\", \"I Am Curious<br />\n(Yellow),\" and \"Dionysus in 69\" at night. Novels, films,<br />\nand plays are a curious invitation into pleasant, but<br />\nsometimes frightening, fiction. Yet each exposes its own<br />\nunreality by exploring with varying degrees of<br />\neffectiveness the anti-fictional techniques of modern<br />\nartistic expression.<br />\nBoth Fiction and Reality<br />\nBrautigan, San Francisco poet and novelist, has<br />\ncome East at last, even convincing Grove Press to publish<br />\nhis best-known book, A Confederate General From Big<br />\nSur. Unlike the \"dear reader\" asides and digressions in<br />\n\"Tom Jones\" or Vanity Fair, or George Elliot's novels,<br />\nBrautigan weaves fiction and anti-fiction in such a way<br />\nthat the reader is never fully aware of what is reality and<br />\nwhat is not. As in Wallace Stevens' poetry, there is a<br />\nconstant \"war between the mind and sky,\" and fiction<br />\nand reality are never distinct.<br />\nConfederate General isandis not about Lee Mellon<br />\nand his grandfather, who was or was not a general in the<br />\nConfederacy. Mellon seems to care about his family<br /><br />\nhistory at first, as does the narrator, but neither one<br />\nallows the fiction to interrupt daily life on Big Sur. Or is<br />\nAn Unlikely Name<br />\nAn earlier novel, Trout Fishing in America, is an<br />\neven better example of anti-fiction. Like Thoreau's<br />\nWalden, it is both a natural history and a \"novel,\" a<br />\nmyth about man coming of age in his relationship to<br />\nnature. Brautigan is more deliberately anti-novelistic in<br />\ntechnique. As Walden Pond is so often personified,<br />\nTrout Fishing becomes interchangeably the novel, its<br />\ntitle, its subject (though only vaguely is this a fish story),<br />\nthe author, the narrator, and more often a character who<br />\nsigns letters with his unlikely name and goes through<br />\nvarious adventures.<br />\nBrautigan never ceases to dash the reader's<br />\ncomplacency, dragging him from one world to the other<br />\nwith the result that the novel both is and is not about<br />\nitself. The book engages every form, from fantastic<br />\nfiction in the \"sea, Sea Rider\" chapter, to anti-novel<br />\nchapters about its cover picture, to Thoreauvian journal<br />\nlists, to a chapter about the book's last word,<br />\n\"mayonaise.\" A the end of the final letter, this word is<br />\nthere simply because the narrator tells the reader it will<br />\nbe, having had the desire some day to write a book with<br />\nsuch an ending.<br />\nWhen Brautigan tells the reader how and when he<br />\nis writing a novel, he creates the same anti-fictional<br />\nfeeling as when he tells the reader to plant a novel. And<br />\n\"Please Plant This Book\" contains seeds to be planted.<br />\nWhat is fact and/or fiction here?<br />\nBisexual Cowboys<br />\nWarhol has been doing this for years on film,<br />\ncreating both a world of characters and a world for the<br />\naudience. Very often his people, real and playing real<br />\nplus fictional roles, talk to the audience, sometimes to<br />\nthe cameraman, and even to each other about the<br /><br />\nr\u2014Veritas<br /><br />\nfilm-life process. There is never purely a story fiction,<br />\nbut always an inter-play of reality and \"plot.\"<br />\nThe closest Warhol has come to a story is<br />\n\"Lonesome Cowboys.\" It is. also his funniest, least<br />\nboring and thoroughly enjoyable film, besides being a<br />\nmockery of western movies. The bisexual cowboys also<br />\npartake of two other simultaneous worlds. They are<br />\nanachronistic: smoking filters, surfing, drinking ring-top<br />\ncans of beer, listening to the Beatles, etc. But they are*<br />\ncowboys in the old West too, lusting it up on the range,<br />\neven to the point of acting out what someone has<br />\nsuggested is a new Romeo and Juliet play.<br />\nBut as in Brautigan's novels, nothing is certain,<br />\nneither the cowboys' nor that of the hilarious spoof of a<br />\nsheriff (at night a drag-queen Indian), nor the characters'<br />\nidentity. If Viva is a female Romeo(Ramona), and Tom<br />\nis a male Juliet (Julian), and the incomparably gay<br />\nTaylor Mead is a \"nurse,\" this solves nothing. Julian and<br />\nTom change names and identities, and no one really<br />\nknows who he is for sure. And it is Ramona who<br />\nmanfully seduces him (her?), whoever this silent,<br />\nenigmatic sex-god may be.<br />\nAdded to this problem are the constant speeches<br />\nand asides to the audience, telling us it is all fiction,<br />\ntogether with the film's absurd moralizing. What should<br />\nlonesome cowboys do?Settle in towns, build them into<br />\ncities, and \"get ready for World War I.\" The viewer<br />\nknows this is a farce of reality but he also enjoys the<br />\nfiction that is sporadically, even pathetically, created<br />\nand sustained.<br />\nNot That Simple<br />\n\"I Am Curious (Yellow)\" is even more anti-film in<br />\ngenre, being a film about making a film. Now and then<br />\nthe director is shown directing and editing, cameras<br />\nfilming, and the action stopping for more light or retakes<br />\nor for the actors to stop fighting. Yet the division is not<br />\nthat simple. The viewer never knows when Lena and<br />\nI (Continued on Page 13)<br /><br />\n'Anti-ROTC Drive Reflects Anti-War Sentiment I<br />\nBy RAYMOND W. COPSON<br />\nSDS and the New University Conference have<br />\nraised the question of the presence of ROTC on the<br />\nHopkins campus. In ordinary times, this presence<br />\nattracted scant interest. However, because ROTC trains<br />\nthose lower echelon officers most useful in the war in<br />\nVietnam, the issue of ROTC has attracted considerable<br />\ninterest outside radical circles on this and other<br />\ncampuses where the war is widely opposed.<br />\nNonetheless, many members of the Hopkins<br />\nCommunity who are opposed to the war in Vietnam<br />\nseem reluctant to take a position against ROTC.

This comparison aside, there is no reason why<br />\nthe tactics employed by some ought to foreclose<br />\ndiscussion and action on the issue by others.<br />\nIn large part, the failure of many peace elements<br />\nto take a stand against ROTC is the result of doubt<br />\nabout the effectiveness of pressure on ROTC as an<br />\nanti-war measure and of fears that undesireable indirect<br /><br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nGOOD HUMOUR needs part time<br />\nsalesman now -- and full time<br />\nlalesmen through the Summer.<br />\nIf you can serve a GOOD<br />\nHUMOUR territory from NOW<br />\nTHROUGH MAY on<br />\nSATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS,<br />\nYou will average $25.00 per day in<br />\ncommissions - with a guaranteed<br />\nMinimum in case of bad weather.<br />\nALL EQUIPMENT FURNISHED.<br />\nWILL BE FULLY<br />\nTRAINED and serve some of our<br />\nbest territories.<br /><br />\nYOU<br /><br />\nTO QUALIFY: You must be 18<br />\nYears of age or older and possess a<br />\nvalid driver's license!<br />\nIf you desire to work in the<br />\nMARYLAND AREA, please call<br />\n52-5330 or come in for an<br />\nI nterview to GOOD HUMOR<br />\nCORPORATION, 1932<br />\nqREENSPRING DRIVE,<br />\nTIMONIUM, MD. 21093.<br />\nIf you desire to work in the<br />\nPENNSYLVANIA AREA, please<br />\n342-4700.<br /><br />\neffects might follow abolition of the program.

What is maintained, however is<br />\nthat agitation against ROTC by students leading to<br />\nrestrictions on ROTC or its abolition at Hopkins and<br />\nelsewhere must raise serious questions in the military<br />\nand in the government about the policy which has led to<br />\nthese heretofore unknown pressures.<br />\nProfessional Military<br />\nSince other modes of action aimed at the war in<br />\nVietnam and US interventionism in general have fallen<br />\ninto disuse as a result of recurrent disappointment,<br />\npressure on ROTC is one of the few means available to<br />\nprevent dissent from the war policy from languishing<br />\naltogether. Some claim of effectiveness must therefore<br />\nbe granted anti-ROTC activity as an anti-war protest.<br />\nOne much-feared side effect of the abolition of<br />\nROTC is the supposed professionalization of the military<br />\nwhich would follow. Since the existence of a<br />\nprofessional U.S. military cannot now be questioned,<br />\nthis fear taken seriously actually reflects the belief that<br />\nan officer corps trained outside ROTC would be more<br />\naggressive, more interventionist and more inclined to<br />\nserve its own interests rather than those of the civilian<br />\n4111iliFilifIRIARBRZ<br /><br />\nBeefmaster's<br />\nPub<br /><br />\nHOWARD at 27th ST.<br /><br />\nFAREWELL<br />\nHOPKINS<br />\nGRADUATES<br /><br />\nw<br /><br />\nENJOY A<br /><br />\nSTEER<br />\n'N BEER<br /><br />\n,z4 GREENWAY PHARMACY<br />\nCHARLES &amp; 34 STS.<br />\n14111111RRRRRIIRRW<br /><br />\nMENU<br /><br />\nBREAK<br />\nThe best beef sandwich in<br />\ntown.

This<br />\nassumption is highly questionable. In the first place,<br />\nmost ROTC graduates come not from the few liberal<br />\neastern universities but from small colleges and large<br />\nstate universities which have a decidedly conservative<br />\norientation. Moreover, at all campuses ROTC tends to<br />\nattract the more conservative students who are<br />\ncommitted to values much like those of their service<br />\nacademy courterparts.<br />\nFurther, it is doubtful that the place of education<br />\nis more important in shaping\"professionalism\" than the<br />\nimposed career patterns, in-service training and shared<br />\nexperiences\u2014 in battle and out\u2014which characterize<br />\nmilitary service. This is not to say that all military<br />\nofficers arc equally aggressive and interventionist, but<br />\nsimply that little reason can be given for the claim that<br />\nROTC encourages amateurism among ranking military<br />\nofficers.<br />\nNor can one maintain that the abolition of ROTC<br />\nwould foster a less intelligent officer corps. Service<br />\nacademy admissions standards compare favorable in<br />\ngeneral with those at colleges where ROT(' is available.<br />\nSelection processes used as alternatives to ROTC,such as<br />\nOCS, necessarily recruit as intelligent a group of<br />\ncandidates as they can. Should ROTC be abolished,<br />\nvolunteers for officer recruitment would most probably<br />\nbe thosewho would have enrolled in ROTC anyway.<br />\nIf it is true that no dire changes in the military<br />\nwould !result from the abolition of ROTC, it is also true<br />\nthat the University could well survive without providing<br />\nmilitary training to its undergraduates Hopkins does not<br />\nhave professional schools in such fields as law and hotel<br />\nmanagement. Surely it would be little impoverished by<br />\nthe departure of ROTC.<br />\nReferendum Essential<br />\nSince abolition could be so readily absorbed, why<br />\nmust the future of ROTC be decided in the secretive<br />\nhigh councils of this university'? The presence of ROTC<br />\non the campus reflects upon the entire university,<br />\ngraduate students, and faculty.<br />\nIf ROTC loses, the administration will recognize<br />\nthat action is best taken now before the latent support<br />\nfor SDS can be radicalized. If ROTC wins, the SDS<br />\nposition will be undercut and future disruptions on this<br />\nissue will be less likely.<br />\nThose who would suffer most from the abolition<br />\nof ROTC are those undergraduates who would be forced<br />\nto serve two years in the ranks or to spend an additional<br />\nyear in the service to obtain a commission through OCS.<br />\nHowever, because of the uses to which the ROTC<br />\nprogram is now being put by the government, the time<br />\nhas come for the University to weigh this hardship<br />\nagainst the opportunity to take an effective step against<br />\nthe war which has made some military hardship<br />\ninevitable for nearly all students.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 12<br /><br />\nAcademic Council to Consider Coeducation Plan<br />\nThe Academic Council will soon<br />\nreceive a report asking that the Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate body be made<br />\nco-educational by 1971.<br />\nThe report which is being<br />\nprepared by the Spcial Committee on<br />\nCo-education, was the object of<br />\nTuesday's Student Council - sponsored<br />\nDialogue discussion. Dean Carl<br />\nSwanson, Committee chairman, pointed<br />\nout that the Committee's formation<br />\nresulted from the faculty's<br />\n\"overwhelming desire to be associated<br />\nwith co-education.\" He defined the<br />\nCommittee's purpose as \"the<br />\nexamination of the feasability and<br />\ndesireability of co-education at<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nNo Plans<br />\nAlthough no concrete plans have<br />\nyet been made, Swanson pointed out<br />\nthat there will be no change in the total<br />\nnumber of students admitted each year.<br />\nThus the co-eds will in fact supplant a<br />\nnumber of what would otherwise have<br />\nbeen male undergraduates. Swanson<br />\nfavors co-education, feeling that the<br />\nUniversity should be \"open to the best<br />\nstudents, regardless of sex.\" He feels<br />\nthat the admission of women would<br />\nuplift the social and intellectual aspects<br />\nof Homewood and would \"provide a<br />\nviable and active student body.\"<br />\nSwanson indicated that<br />\nimplementation of co-education would<br />\nbe done by the administration.<br />\nHe mentioned that a number of<br />\nother problems, such as housing \u2022 (it<br />\nwould cost $300,000 to make the old<br /><br />\ndorms suitable for female inhabitation),<br />\nwould have to be taken in detail. later.<br />\nHe also felt that the University should<br />\nlend a hand in increasing the social<br />\nfacilities on campus.<br />\nThe Dean hopes to get the report<br />\nto the Council at its last meeting this<br />\nmonth. That way the Council will be<br />\nable to examine it and tell the<br />\n.Committee what further information it<br />\nneeds in order to act.<br />\nImprove Conditions<br />\nDr. Jack Greene, a professor of<br />\nHistory and member of the Committee,<br />\nstrongly favors co-education as a means<br />\nto \"improve the intellectual<br />\nenvironment at Hopkins.\" Basing his<br />\nobservations on prior experience<br />\nobtained while teaching mixed classes at<br />\nMichigan State, Dr. Greene proposed<br />\nthat female students would serve as an<br />\n\"intellectual prod\" to male students,<br />\nthus relieving the dullness and \"lack of<br />\nintellectual involvement that now<br />\ncharacterize undergraduate classes.\"<br />\nDr. Greene talked of the<br />\n\"dynamics of a class\", saying that for<br />\nsome reason boys don't do assigned<br />\nwork unless threatened with tests and<br />\nquizzes. Girls, however, do their<br />\nassignments and, in a mixed class, the<br />\nboys work in order to keep above the<br />\ngirls.<br />\nClaiming that there are \"no<br />\ngrounds for excluding females\" Dr.<br />\nGreene voiced opposition to any plans<br />\nfor treating women differently from<br />\nmen should they ever arrive on campus.<br />\nHe particularly referred to housing,<br /><br />\nsaying that there should be \"no increase<br />\nin parietal rules\" for women. He favors<br />\nthe implementation of co-education by<br />\n\"no later than 1970.\"<br />\nOpposition<br />\nA slightly differing view was<br />\noffered by Professor of Physics Donald<br />\nKerr, also a Committee member. Asking<br />\nthat the submission of the report be<br />\npostponed, Dr. Kerr referred to the<br />\nnecessity of initiating a more detailed<br />\nstudy before deciding whether or not to<br />\naccept co-education. He pointed out<br />\nthat co-education would \"change very<br />\nprofoundly the nature of the<br />\nUniversity;\" that while there will be<br />\ncertain gains, \"other things and people<br />\nwill pay.\"<br />\nIn particular, Dr. Kerr stressed the<br />\nnecessity of investigating the effects of<br />\nco-education on the different<br /><br />\ndepartments. He cited studies made at<br />\nPrinceton and Yale that indicate a<br />\nnatural decrease in enrollment in the<br />\nsciences and engineering with a<br />\ncorresponding increase in interest in the<br />\nhumanities and social sciences. This, he<br />\nfelt, would ultimately produce an effect<br />\non the University and its reputation.<br />\nSuch an effect \"could not be taken<br />\nlightly.\"<br />\nDr. Kerr continued by saying that<br />\nhe had not yet made up his mind<br />\nwhether or not to support the<br />\nproposals. He was not arguing against<br />\nco-education, he claimed, only asking<br />\nthat more time be devoted to studying<br />\nthe matter. \"It is impossible to act<br />\nintelligently in this short time,\" he said,<br />\n\"although we ought to be able to reach<br />\nsome decision during the next academic<br />\nyear.\"<br /><br />\nGordon Finds Open Door<br />\nRobert Bilgrave, Director of<br />\nStudent Affairs, announced his<br />\nintention \"to speak in broad<br />\ngeneralities,\" and then proceeded to do<br />\nso.<br /><br />\nlowest position on the university<br />\nthat<br />\npriority list.\" He further observed the<br />\naffecting<br />\n\"every decision<br />\nundergraduate has always been made<br />\nfrom a faculty administrative<br />\nviewpoint.\"<br /><br />\nJohn Guess began his comments<br />\nwith the observation that he did not feel<br />\nthat he, as an undergraduate, was \"a<br />\npolicymaker,\" though he hoped that<br />\n\"students would be policymakers in the<br />\nfuture.\"<br />\nGuess charged that \"the<br />\nundergraduate has always had the<br /><br />\nDr. Gordon replied that it was<br />\n\"wrong to suppose that teaching is the<br />\nonly function of this University:' He<br />\nwent on to point out that \"Hopkins is<br />\nprimarily a research... and professionallY<br />\noriented university, for those who feel<br />\nthey can realize themselves in such all<br />\nenvironment.\"<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 3)<br /><br />\nThe Goucher College Magic Circle<br />\nChapter of the Maria Goretti Society<br />\nannounces the final meeting of the 1969<br />\nspring term.

Since Hopkins seeks to enroll a<br />\nfreshman class of 525, approximately 1050 students<br />\nmust be accepted. The class size at this time stands at<br />\n533, although that number is not final as \"there are<br />\nalways a few summer withdrawls.\"<br />\nApril 15<br />\nMr. Brinkley labeled the University's admissions<br />\npolicy as \"precipitous ',' in the sense that Hopkins mails<br />\nall its decisions at once, on April 15 of each year. This is<br />\nopposed to the former practice of accepting a number of<br />\n\"early decision\" candidates (applicants who specified<br />\nHopkins as their first choice and promised to enroll here<br />\nif accepted). The \"early decision\" plan has been in use<br />\nunder former Admissions Director, Robert Bilgraves, but<br />\nwas discontinued before Brinkley assumed the<br />\nDirectorship.<br />\nConcerning the type of student who is accepted by<br />\nthe Office of Admissions, Brinkley stressed academic<br />\nachievement as the major criterion. \"We are primarily<br /><br />\ninterested in academic and intellectual interests and<br />\nabilities, although we also want students with interests in<br />\noutside activities.\" The Director said that he was not<br />\n\"turned off\" by prospective applicants who come to<br />\ninterviews in long hair or hippie dress. Such things, he<br />\nfelt, are not as important as the student's academic<br />\nrecord.<br />\nWhen asked if he thought that a trend toward<br />\nactivism is developing in the younger classes, Mr.<br />\nBrinkley thought that t'this might be true, and that there<br />\nmight ill fact be a .sort of \"generation gap\" between the<br />\nseniors and freshman. \"Hopkins,\" said the Director, \"is<br />\ninterested in involved people; our students are typical of<br />\nthe college-going generation today.\" He also mentioned<br />\nthat it is impossible to forecast the make-up of any<br />\nincoming class at this early date. The major reason cited<br />\nwas the great disparity between , the number of<br />\nacceptances and the number of actual enrollments.<br />\nAs to increased Negro enrollment, Mr. Brinkley<br />\nsaid that the University is \"very much interested in<br />\nminority groups.\" He pointed out that a wide<br />\nsocio-economic distribution is in, a way \"self-educating\"<br />\nin that it promotes the interaction of students with<br />\ndiverse interests and backgrounds.<br />\nMr. Brinkley was particularly grateful to the Black<br />\nStudents Union for . its assistance in recruiting black<br />\nstudents. Despite these efforts, however. Hopkins will<br />\nenroll only as many minority students as last year. The<br />\nreason given for this is the intense competition for high<br />\ncaliber non-white students among major universities.<br /><br />\nOn the subject of co-education, Mr. Brinkley felt<br />\nthat the admission of women students would not .affect<br />\nany appreciable change in admissions procedures.<br />\nHopkins would continue to accept \"the same caliber of<br />\nstudent in terms of academic potential\" as it does now.<br /><br />\nWilliam Brinkley, Director of Admissions, said next year's class<br />\nwas selected from the largest number of applicants in Hopkins'<br />\nhistory.<br /><br />\nTheater: \"A Most Intimate Place\"<br />\n(Continued from Page 11)<br /><br />\nBorje (who keep their real names) are<br />\nPlaying their parts or being themselves, whether<br />\ntheir celebrated nude scenes are between actors<br />\nor characters.

The Performance<br />\nGroup, in \"Dionysus in 69,\" like the Living<br />\nTheater, compels audience participation, for the<br />\nClassical tragedy of Euripides and the spectators<br /><br />\nbecome indissolubly fused. The audience is not<br />\nonly invited to dance in the Bacchic revels, but<br />\ncharacters are constantly roaming and climbing<br />\nabout the stageless untheater room, talking to<br />\nthe audience (1 even had a discussion with one<br />\nplayer).

The<br />\ndemocratic process is meaningful only after the<br />\nelectorate is informed of the issues, not before.<br />\nFinally, to take a poll while this ROTC issue is<br />\nstill so emotional is absurd.<br />\nSecond: the poll falsely states the<br />\nanti-ROTC position.

I am very proud that<br />\nthey presented their appeal in the proper manner<br />\nand through the proper channels. I am hopeful<br />\nthat fact had some influence on the final<br />\noutcome.<br />\nSecondly, there was reference in Mr.<br />\nBernstein's article in the May 9 issue to the \"high<br />\nlevel of stealing on the part of service employees<br />\nof the center.\" There unfortunately has been<br />\nsome, not so much of equipment as of money,<br />\nand where proved, the men have been dismissed.<br />\nI regret to say that some of the equipment<br />\nlosses occur because a few of our students take<br />\nadvantage of our inadequate help in the Center.<br />\nUnknown outsiders brought in by some of our<br />\nfaculty and students as guests and then turned<br />\nloose in the building also do their share of taking<br />\nitems.<br />\ncould not let the assumption rest that<br />\nstealing by our help in the Center is the main<br />\nreason our equipment situation is so desperate.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nMarshall S. Turner, Jr.<br />\nVERITAS?<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to challenge the \"Veritas\"<br />\narticle by Robert M. Lipshutz in which he states<br />\n\"ROTC civilianizes the Army.\" Mr. Lipshutz<br />\nseems to believe that most college graduates have<br />\nbeen liberalized and would question military<br />\ndoctrine more than their \"friends from back<br />\nhome.\" Either Mr. Lipshutz has a dim-witted<br />\nbunch of friends or he fails to realize that most<br />\nardent hawks and those who control the Armed<br />\nServices have college educations. Besides, what<br />\nhappens to those college graduates who were not<br />\nin the ROTC program? They get drafted and end<br />\nup as enlisted men or, in many cases, go through<br />\nOCS and become officers anyway. Many ROTC<br />\nofficers find themselves as firing range<br />\ninstructors, recruitors, or in other \"vital\"<br />\nposit ions.<br />\nI'm a rare animal on the Hopkins campus<br />\nsince I'm an undergraduate and a veteran of<br />\nVietnam- a victim of the draft. I was assigned to<br />\nan aviation unit and worked in the Operations<br />\nSection, so I was exposed to all types of<br />\nand ROTC men, West Pointers,<br />\nof<br />\nWarrent Officers, and even WWII Field<br />\nCommissioned Officers. I found that \u201ethe ROTC<br />\nofficers ranked with the Pointers :IS the most<br />\n\"gungho.\" Warrant Officers are the most civilian<br />\ntype. In fact, they are referred to as \"Mr. X\"<br />\nrather than \"Major Y, sir!\" OCS officers have all<br />\nbeen through the mill as enlisted men and were<br />\nquite humanistic, or at least sympathetic, in their<br />\noutlyok. To cite ,one instance of an enlightened<br />\ncollege graduate: our Company Commander, a<br />\nROTC man; was\u2022on his way to the showers one<br />\nevening and passed through the enlisted men's<br /><br />\ntent area. He happened to overhear a slightly<br />\nenebriated door-gunner utter a few profane<br />\nwords about LBJ. Well, by the time the dust<br />\ncleared, the hapless gunner was given a six month<br />\nvacation at the LBJ (Long Binh Jail). Certainly<br />\nnot all ROTC officers are like this, but I think<br />\nyou get the point, Mr. Lipshutz.<br />\nI would like to suggest that ROTC<br />\nvoluntarily withdraw itself from the Hopkins<br />\ncampus and establish its headquarters on its own<br />\nland. This could be a strategic retreat. For<br />\ninstance, if there were one ROTC center in the<br />\nBaltimore area, it could offer its benefits to all<br />\nstudents in its proximity.

The<br />\nAmerican Nazi Party and ROTC have as much<br />\nright to be here as SDS and the YMCA.<br />\nExpulsion of a group from the university should<br />\nbe done only for repeated or serious violations of<br />\nethics and good conduct. The political point of<br />\nview represented by ROTC has nothing to do<br />\nwith its qualifications to be on campus.<br />\nThe second principle is Due Process. If<br />\nROTC is charged with violations of ethics and<br />\ngood conduct, then the evidence should be<br />\npresented before an appropriate judicial body:<br />\none already in existence or one specially<br />\nappointed or elected. We need documented<br />\nevidence formally presented, not campaign<br />\nrhetoric at a May Day rally.<br />\nGuidelines defining ethics and good<br />\nconduct have already been established by the<br />\nAmerican Association of University Professors in<br />\norder to protect the academic freedom of faculty<br />\nmembers. These same guidelines could easily be<br />\napplied to the ROTC question. If ROTC needs to<br />\nbe expelled from Hopkins, let it be done for the<br />\nproper reasons and using the proper proceedure.<br />\nJohn Wickham<br />\n...AND CON<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRegarding Mr. Lipschutz's article on<br />\nROTC, let me say that he is not only<br />\nmisinformed, but also proliferating<br />\nmisinformation. Rather than debate the entire<br />\nROTC issue with you, let me supply some<br />\ncorrections to his statements.<br />\nWhile Dean Swanson announced in the<br />\nSpring 1969 Johns Hopkins Magazine that ROTC<br />\n\"is regarded as an extracurricular activity,\" he<br />\nwas not speaking for the ROTC cadre. The fact is<br />\nthat Colonel Parmly has stated to me that ROTC<br />\nis not considered an extracurricular activity,<br />\nwhereas Pershing Rifles and the rifle team are.<br />\nAlso, no semantical distinctions can get around<br />\nthe fact that academic credit for ROTC is only<br />\nbeing phased out; that is, current MS l's will<br />\ncontinue to have ROTC grades averaged in until<br />\ntheir graduation, as will all those in classes ahead<br />\nof them.<br />\nGetting out of the advanced ROTC course<br />\nor refusing the commission the Army offers<br />\ngraduates is not as easy as you make it sound.<br />\nConversations with Colonel Parmly indicate that<br />\nthe Army has an easy time of unilaterally ending<br />\nthe scholarship contract, while the cadet must<br />\nmake a formal request to end it. The probability<br />\nof the request being allowed depends on the<br />\nArmy's need for men. A regular ROTC cad?t<br />\nfaces prosecution for violating a binding contract<br />\nor call up to active duty (he is in the reserves<br />\nalready). in the case that he refuses his<br />\ncommission.<br />\n'Continued on Pqe 1.5<br />\n.1<br /><br />\nit's your summer place for<br />\nall the going-gear S5 to $11<br />\nTo start, gather lots of cotton knit shirts<br />\nin stripes and solids; S, M, L, $5 to $6<br />\nAdd a pair \u2014 and a spare \u2014 of walk shorts in<br />\npick of solids, checks or plaids, $6 to $7<br />\nPlus tattersall-checked Farah Thins, $11<br />\nBoth in polyester-cotton; 31 to 36 waists.<br />\nVarsity Shop \u2014 all five stores<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 16, 1969<br /><br />\nThat ROTC civilianizes the Army<br />\nis highly ,debatable.

The persistant<br />\nagitator would then have taken himself out of the<br />\ncommunity. He is the one who decides; not the<br />\nadministration.\"<br />\nThe reactions at Hopkins have centered mainly on<br />\nIIEW decision to cut off aid to student<br />\nrecent<br />\nthe<br />\nprotestors. In an April letter to HEW Secretary Robert<br />\nFinch, President Gordon opposed this action as not<br />\nbeing applicable to the present situation. \"It is<br />\ndifficult,\" read the letter in part, \"for me to envisage a<br />\nsituation in which an individual could be guilty of<br />\nsufficiently serious disruptive action to warrant the<br />\napplication of these sanctions without at the same time<br />\nhaving his connection- with the University suspended or<br />\ntermina ted.\"<br />\nFederal Aid<br />\nThis feeling was echoed by Hopkins Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid, David Kaufman. According to Mr.<br />\nKaufman, if a student has done something so out of line<br /><br />\nthat he would ordinarily be dropped from the<br />\nUniversity, the \"underhanded method\" of withdrawing<br />\naid shouldn't be used as a \"weapon of punishment.\" If a<br />\nstudent is convicted of a crime, however, his federal aid<br />\nshould be automatically revoked. If he is not convicted,<br />\nit should be left up to the university to decide his fate.<br />\nThe Director stated that Hopkins espouses a<br />\n\"flexible\" philosophy of financial aid, and that since no<br />\ncases of this sort have come up, the University will have<br />\nto \"play it by ear.\" The decision is out of the<br />\nUniversity's hands, however, since the government can<br />\ncut off all aid to the students of any institution failing to<br />\ncomply with any Federal statute.<br />\nSome Positive Reactions<br />\nNot all reactions to the Nixon doctrine have been<br />\nnegative. The Board of Trustees of Cornell University<br />\nhas communicated to President Perkins that they expect<br />\nhim to implement their declaration that \"tactics of<br />\nterror\" would be met by \"firm and appropriate<br />\nresponse.\"<br />\nOne hundred and nine Memphis State University<br />\nstudents have been bound over for grand-jury action and<br />\nsuspended from school for staging a sit-in at the<br />\npresident's- office. Stanford University suspended 33<br />\nstudents for ransacking files. It was the first time police<br />\nhad ever been called onto the Stanford campus.<br /><br />\nIn *addition to. finding a solution to the<br />\nbudget problems of Levering Hall for the next<br />\nschool year, members of the Hopkins<br />\nadministration and of the Student Association<br />\nhave worked out a new organizational program<br />\nfor the Chaplain's Office.<br /><br />\nThe new organization will include both a Levering<br />\nHall Council, composed of students, faculty and<br />\nadministrators and an Executive Board which will be<br />\nselected by the members of the Council.

Dr. Bevan has<br />\nalready volunteered to serve as the chairman for the<br />\nExecutive Council on a temporary basis.<br />\nIn effect, the new organization means that the<br />\nChaplain's Office and Levering Hall will plug into the<br />\nUniversity chain of command at the level of one of the<br />\nOffice<br />\nvice-presidents.

In<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference, the<br />\nteam ended up in 5th place, with a 3-3-1<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe season was an excitirtg one for<br />\nboth the players and the fans. For the<br />\nPlayers, there was a respect for<br />\nteammates 'and an, enthusiasm in<br />\nknowing that there was the potential to<br />\nwin. For the fans, there was the<br />\nexcitement of booming bats, and highly<br />\nSpirited ballplayers.<br />\nThe Blue-Jays cracked 100 hits on<br />\nthe season, including 17 doubles, 6<br />\ntriples, and 5 homeruns. They compiled<br />\na .246 team batting average. They<br />\nscored 64 runs as they continuously hit<br />\nlike a winning team. Time and again,<br />\nhowever, they were unable to hold<br />\ndown the opposition. The competition<br />\nscored 83 runs on 95 hits.<br />\nThree Problems<br />\nA look at the final statistics<br />\nreveals the fact that three major<br />\nproblems plagued the Jays. First, the<br />\nPitchers allowed 80 walks, while our<br />\nbatters were issued only 45 free passes.<br />\nSecond, the defense was shabby,<br />\ncommitting 38 errors, many of which<br />\nwere costly.<br />\nLastly, there was a lack of<br />\npersonnel, causing extra burden on the<br />\nregular players, especially the pitchers.<br />\nIn spite of these problems, the<br />\nteam has been in contention in almost<br />\nevery game they have lost.

The rally fell<br />\nshort, and the final score was 7-6.<br />\nHopkins pitchers gave up ten walks.<br />\nThe two senior co-captains, Chip<br />\nBreschkin and Jim Zuger, led the club in<br />\nhitting. Breschkin ended the season with<br />\na .391 mark, including 11 RBI's and 6<br />\ndoubles. In addition, he batted .524 in<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference, giving<br />\nhim an excellent chance to win the<br />\nbatting crown.<br />\nZuger ended the season at a .347<br />\nclip, including 12 RBI's.

This article is<br />\nabout one of those Hopkins students<br />\nwho never makes the headlines and is<br />\nonly occasionally mentioned in our<br />\nsports articles.<br />\nThe outstanding student is often<br />\nlauded, as is the outstanding college<br />\nathlete. But how often is the<br />\nstudent-athlete recognized for his<br />\naccomplishments? Graduating senior,<br />\nJosh Treem, is one who should be<br />\nacknowledged for his successful<br />\ncombination of athletics, academics, and<br />\nextracurricular activities.<br />\nWhile maintaining an excellent<br />\nscholastic average, he has managed to<br />\nletter two years on the varsity swimming<br />\nteam, write frequent articles for the<br />\nNews-Letter, act as chairman of the<br />\n1968-69 Freshman Orientation<br />\nCommittee, and participate in fraternity<br />\nactivities.<br />\nAs a swimmer, he is esteemed by<br />\nhis peets,and valued by Coach Comfort,<br /><br />\nas one who \"could be counted on to get<br />\nthe job done\" in a tight meet.

Finch<br />\nhave both adopted a somewhat milder tone on campus<br />\nproblems than has been taken by other administration<br />\nofficials in recent weeks.<br />\nOne of those administration officials is Spiro T.<br />\nAgnew. He told a student audience at Brigham Young<br />\nUniversity that colleges should assert themselves against<br />\ndisruptive student dissidents. \"Improvement cannot be<br />\nachieved in a condition of anarchy or uproar,\" declared<br />\nthe Vice-President.

One of the surprises of the<br />\nsurvey was the fact that protest is almost as likely to<br />\noccur in junior high schools as in senior high schools.\"<br />\nThe central issue in most of the protest is the<br />\ngrowing effort toward more student freedom and<br />\ninvolvement in school policy. In Jonesboro, Ga., 200<br />\nhigh school students walked out, asserting that their civil<br />\nrights had been denied because smoking was prohibited<br />\non campus.<br />\nIn Kingsville, Texas, 110 Mexican-American<br />\nstudents were arrested on charges .of unlawful assembly<br />\nand disturbing the peace after a walkout and<br />\ndemonstration in which a leader said, \"All these stories<br />\nabout David Crockett and Daniel Boone, but never<br />\nabout Juan Seguin or other Mexican heroes.
