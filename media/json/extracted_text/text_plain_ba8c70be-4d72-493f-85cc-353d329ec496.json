Degrees<br />\nConferred and Prize Award Announced.<br />\nFund On The Way.<br />\nExercises commemorating the thirty-fourth anniversary were he'd in<br />\nMcCoy Hall, Tuesay morning. A fanfare from \"Lohengrin\" (arranged by<br />\nMr. Turnbull), was played by trumpets in the lobby at 10.45 a.m., as a<br />\nSignal for the academic procession to<br />\nProceed to the Assembly Room.<br />\nThe chief marshal was Professor<br />\nMatthews.<br />\nThe president of the University,<br />\nthe Mayor of the city, the Orator.<br />\nthe Chaplain,Trustees,guests and Faculty, formed the first division, which<br />\nwas under the direction of Professor<br />\nBrush, and made an imposing spectac!e with the van -colored gowns, betokening degrees from practically all<br />\nthe great universities of the world.<br />\nThe marshal of the second division,<br />\nthe Alumni and candidates for Degrees, was Professor J. W. Williams,<br />\npresident of the Alumni Association.<br />\nThe graduate s'udents in Arts and<br />\nSciences, the students of Medicine<br />\n'and undergradute students were marbhalled by Drs. Watson, Knox and<br />\nAbercrombie.<br />\nThe music, which was under the<br />\nthrection of Edwin Litchfield Turnbull (A.B., 1893), was furnished by<br />\nPlayers from the Peabody Conservatory<br />\n- and the United States Marine<br />\nBand of Washington.<br />\nThe exercises were opened with<br />\nprayer. by Reverend Harris Eliot<br />\nKirk, pastor of Franklin Street Presbyetrian Church.<br />\nIn introducing the principal speaker of the day, President Remsen<br />\nSpoke of the very cordial feeling<br />\nand close intercourse between the two<br />\nuniversities, drawing attention to the<br />\nfact that there are ten Johns Hopkins men on the staff of the UniverSay of Toronto, and seven Toronto<br />\nvraduates among the members of our<br />\nFaculty.<br />\n, \"During the last half-dozen years,\"<br />\nSaid President Remsen, \"the University of Toronto has been undergoing<br />\na reorganization, one of the most important steps of which was the calling of Dr. Robert A. Falconer to<br />\nthe president's chair. I take pleasure<br />\n<br />\nin introducing him as the orator of<br />\nthe day.\"<br />\nPresident Falconer emphasized in<br />\nhis address the conservatism of Canadian life. His address was an analysis of what seems to be the Canadian nationality, Two influences<br />\nwere emphasized. First, the influx<br />\nof those in whom loyalty to the King<br />\nwas the dominating factor, at the<br />\ntime of the American Revolution..<br />\n\"Those who remained,\" said Dr.<br />\nFalconer, \"surpassed those who went<br />\nNorth, both in intellectual powers<br />\nand political ideals. I have no doubt<br />\n'hat your great leaders put forth<br />\nideas which have not been surpassed. But the too,000 loyalists who<br />\nwent North to settle in the provinces<br />\nand Ontario, although somewhat narrow in their beliefs, were a distinctly conservative element.<br />\n\"In 1790 and the years following<br />\n'here was an immigrative element<br />\nwhich consisted of officers and soldiers of disbanded regiments. Sonic<br />\ncame from the country districts of<br />\nEngland and these had conservative<br />\nviews also, and, transported into a<br />\nworld which was a wilderness, with<br />\nno means of communication with the<br />\nlarger peoples of the South, lived<br />\nalone for over a generation and transmitted views unpolluted by outside<br />\ninfluences. These two elements,somewhat different but still practically the<br />\nsame in the fundamental conservatism, which is one of the chief strata<br />\nin Canadian life, are all-important<br />\nfactors.<br />\n\"This reliability is evident at the<br />\npresent time. We are brilliant, but<br />\nnot fickle, emotional but steadfast,<br />\n'rue to the past and hopeful for the<br />\nfuture. We have always had a regard for law and order, even in the<br />\noutlying mining districts.<br />\n\"The second element which differentiates us from the people across<br />\nthe border is, that your ideals came<br />\nfrom the Continent, and the facility<br />\nwith which you have assimilated the<br />\ninnnigrant hordes which have poured<br />\nin upon you shows, perhaps, your<br />\ngreater vitality.<br />\n<br />\n22, 1910.<br />\n<br />\n\"We, on the other hand, have looked toward Great Britain. Annexation and revolut:onary sentiment have<br />\nbeen occasional, but no independent<br />\nagitation, and our eyes have looked<br />\nsteadfastly toward England, and, unless you take into account out attitude toward our Mother Country,you<br />\ncannot understand the Canadian of<br />\ntoday. We have shared in the experiences of Great Britain. Pitt has<br />\nbeen ours, Peel, Beaconsfield, Salisbury, and we take a vital interest<br />\nin th budget struggle.\"<br />\nIn mentioning the Canadian form<br />\nof government, Dr. Falconer made<br />\na witty reference to the antagonistic<br />\nelements of the Republican party,represented by President Taft on the<br />\none hand, and Speaker Cannon on<br />\nthe other, saying that \"we have no<br />\ngovernor in the sense that you have,<br />\nand no Speaker of the House who<br />\nmay have a different policy.\"<br />\n\"In education our union with England is marked, in ecclesiastical affpirs we have followed the leadership of the Old World.\"<br />\n\"Last summer theer were two important celebrations at Geneva,\" said<br />\nPresident Remsen, \"one was of a<br />\nuniversity nature, the other in honor<br />\nof Calvin. I have asked Professor<br />\nBright, who represented this University at the convention, to tell us<br />\nsomething, about them.\"<br />\nProfessor Bright, after speaking of<br />\nthe meaning of the Genevan celebration, and reviewing in detail the work<br />\nand services of Calvin, mentioned<br />\nthe analogy to Johns Hopkins.<br />\n\"Calvin began his school very much<br />\nin the manner that has become known<br />\nto us here through the 'launching of<br />\na university.' This coincidence is<br />\nnothing more, but also nothing less,<br />\nthat proof that there is but one true<br />\nmethod for the founding of a university. Secure three or four or more<br />\ngeat scholars as teahcers, and the<br />\nthing is done. Calvin began (as did<br />\nPresident Gilman) with the professorship of Greek. Theodore Beza,<br />\nthen at the school in Lausanne, was<br />\ndesignated professor of Greek in the<br />\ncollege that was to he opened the<br />\nnext year.<br />\n\"In the lineal inheritance of Calvinistic influences in America, Puritan New England was, of course, a<br />\npreferred heir. But there was a collateral bestowal by the University of<br />\nGeneva upon Virginia that deserves<br />\nto be kept in perpetual memembrance.<br />\nThis was involved in a novel incident in the history of American univerFities, made familiar to the wider<br />\npublic through one of the published<br />\nContinued on page 4, column 2.<br />\n<br />\nPrice, 3 cents per copy.<br />\nTHE PRESIDENT'S<br />\nANNOIJ NCEMENTS<br />\n\u2014o\u2014<br />\nHomewood and Academic Expansion\u2014Two Millions Needed.<br />\nIn taking up that part of the program which probably was of greatest<br />\ninterest to the audience \u2014 the Announcements of the President of the<br />\nUniversity\u2014President Remsen spoke<br />\nbriefly as follows:<br />\n\"Announcements,\" he said in introduction, \"is not at all a good title<br />\nfor the remarks it is my duty to<br />\nmake. 'Statements' is perhaps a better word; but it seems to me that<br />\nmedley is still more inclusive.<br />\n\"The reception of messages from<br />\nnewly formed alumni associations in<br />\nother universities is extremely gratifying, testifying the increasing active interest of Hopkins men in the<br />\nUniversity. Among the first letters<br />\nto arrive were two from the alumni<br />\nof the University of West Virginia<br />\nand North Carolina.\"<br />\nThe result of the recent election<br />\nfor members of the Alumni Council<br />\nwas as follows: Dr. Thomas S.

Adams. I refer to the<br />\nac of Thomas Jefferson in seriously<br />\nproposing `to translate the Academy<br />\nof Geneva in a body to this country;'<br />\nto transplant the institution, root and<br />\nbranch, from its native soil to that<br />\nof Virginia. 'While upon foreign<br />\niFs'ons in the interest of the United<br />\nStates,' writes Professor Adams,'Jefferson kept making inquiries into<br />\nthe best systems of university education in the Old World.' After expressing various judgments he finally<br />\nwrote, in the year 1791, as follows:<br />\n'With respect to the schools of Europe my mind is perfectly made up.<br />\nand on full inquiry. The best in the<br />\nOn the<br />\nworld is Edinburgh. . .<br />\ncontinent of Europe, no place is comparable to Geneva.' After his return<br />\nto America, it is reported that he<br />\nwas wont to speak of these universities as 'the two eyes of Europe.' Before that return, however, the academic repose of the University of Geneva became disturbed by reason of<br />\nhaving fallen into disfavor with the<br />\nrevolutionary party, and this circumqance led Jefferson somewhat precipitously to indulge the belief that<br />\nhe could, without detriment to either<br />\ntransplant cne of the eyes of<br />\nFurope into an American socket. But<br />\nWasihngton, to whom the plan was<br />\nat once submitted, disapproved of<br />\nsuch drastic surgery, and his arguments prevailed. The new country<br />\nwas not yet prepared for a national<br />\nuniversity, this was the implication.<br />\nand in no conceivable circumstances<br />\nnrYsablv, could such a mechanical<br />\ntransference ever be advantageous.<br />\n\"This extraord.nary incident conrec's the nan-es of crtivin. Washington, and .Terferson, three oc<br />\ne-,:nent advocates of the University<br />\nas an indisnensable factor in the<br />\neconomy of the Commonwealth. Jefferson surveyed his life and concluded with the wish that future generaCons might know him for the accomnlishemnt of three acts of public<br />\ncerv:ce : the composition of the Decnf Independence. the corwepr:n., of tbe statute of Virginia for<br />\n,<br />\nreliffiotts freedom, and the foundin;'<br />\nnf the University of Virginia. Wash:n-ton served as chancellor of the<br />\nrenege of William and Mary from<br />\nti\u2014e nreceding his presidency of<br />\n5 Trifeti States to the end of his<br />\n1;fe; and he was the father of the<br />\nidea of a nat'onal university.

Falconer to<br />\nthe president's chair. I take pleasure<br /><br />\nin introducing him as the orator of<br />\nthe day.\"<br />\nPresident Falconer emphasized in<br />\nhis address the conservatism of Canadian life. His address was an analysis of what seems to be the Canadian nationality, Two influences<br />\nwere emphasized. First, the influx<br />\nof those in whom loyalty to the King<br />\nwas the dominating factor, at the<br />\ntime of the American Revolution..<br />\n\"Those who remained,\" said Dr.<br />\nFalconer, \"surpassed those who went<br />\nNorth, both in intellectual powers<br />\nand political ideals. I have no doubt<br />\n'hat your great leaders put forth<br />\nideas which have not been surpassed. But the too,000 loyalists who<br />\nwent North to settle in the provinces<br />\nand Ontario, although somewhat narrow in their beliefs, were a distinctly conservative element.<br />\n\"In 1790 and the years following<br />\n'here was an immigrative element<br />\nwhich consisted of officers and soldiers of disbanded regiments. Sonic<br />\ncame from the country districts of<br />\nEngland and these had conservative<br />\nviews also, and, transported into a<br />\nworld which was a wilderness, with<br />\nno means of communication with the<br />\nlarger peoples of the South, lived<br />\nalone for over a generation and transmitted views unpolluted by outside<br />\ninfluences. These two elements,somewhat different but still practically the<br />\nsame in the fundamental conservatism, which is one of the chief strata<br />\nin Canadian life, are all-important<br />\nfactors.<br />\n\"This reliability is evident at the<br />\npresent time. We are brilliant, but<br />\nnot fickle, emotional but steadfast,<br />\n'rue to the past and hopeful for the<br />\nfuture. We have always had a regard for law and order, even in the<br />\noutlying mining districts.<br />\n\"The second element which differentiates us from the people across<br />\nthe border is, that your ideals came<br />\nfrom the Continent, and the facility<br />\nwith which you have assimilated the<br />\ninnnigrant hordes which have poured<br />\nin upon you shows, perhaps, your<br />\ngreater vitality.<br /><br />\n22, 1910.<br /><br />\n\"We, on the other hand, have looked toward Great Britain. Annexation and revolut:onary sentiment have<br />\nbeen occasional, but no independent<br />\nagitation, and our eyes have looked<br />\nsteadfastly toward England, and, unless you take into account out attitude toward our Mother Country,you<br />\ncannot understand the Canadian of<br />\ntoday. We have shared in the experiences of Great Britain. Pitt has<br />\nbeen ours, Peel, Beaconsfield, Salisbury, and we take a vital interest<br />\nin th budget struggle.\"<br />\nIn mentioning the Canadian form<br />\nof government, Dr. Falconer made<br />\na witty reference to the antagonistic<br />\nelements of the Republican party,represented by President Taft on the<br />\none hand, and Speaker Cannon on<br />\nthe other, saying that \"we have no<br />\ngovernor in the sense that you have,<br />\nand no Speaker of the House who<br />\nmay have a different policy.\"<br />\n\"In education our union with England is marked, in ecclesiastical affpirs we have followed the leadership of the Old World.\"<br />\n\"Last summer theer were two important celebrations at Geneva,\" said<br />\nPresident Remsen, \"one was of a<br />\nuniversity nature, the other in honor<br />\nof Calvin. I have asked Professor<br />\nBright, who represented this University at the convention, to tell us<br />\nsomething, about them.\"<br />\nProfessor Bright, after speaking of<br />\nthe meaning of the Genevan celebration, and reviewing in detail the work<br />\nand services of Calvin, mentioned<br />\nthe analogy to Johns Hopkins.<br />\n\"Calvin began his school very much<br />\nin the manner that has become known<br />\nto us here through the 'launching of<br />\na university.' This coincidence is<br />\nnothing more, but also nothing less,<br />\nthat proof that there is but one true<br />\nmethod for the founding of a university. Secure three or four or more<br />\ngeat scholars as teahcers, and the<br />\nthing is done. Calvin began (as did<br />\nPresident Gilman) with the professorship of Greek. Theodore Beza,<br />\nthen at the school in Lausanne, was<br />\ndesignated professor of Greek in the<br />\ncollege that was to he opened the<br />\nnext year.<br />\n\"In the lineal inheritance of Calvinistic influences in America, Puritan New England was, of course, a<br />\npreferred heir. But there was a collateral bestowal by the University of<br />\nGeneva upon Virginia that deserves<br />\nto be kept in perpetual memembrance.<br />\nThis was involved in a novel incident in the history of American univerFities, made familiar to the wider<br />\npublic through one of the published<br />\nContinued on page 4, column 2.<br /><br />\nPrice, 3 cents per copy.<br />\nTHE PRESIDENT'S<br />\nANNOIJ NCEMENTS<br />\n\u2014o\u2014<br />\nHomewood and Academic Expansion\u2014Two Millions Needed.<br />\nIn taking up that part of the program which probably was of greatest<br />\ninterest to the audience \u2014 the Announcements of the President of the<br />\nUniversity\u2014President Remsen spoke<br />\nbriefly as follows:<br />\n\"Announcements,\" he said in introduction, \"is not at all a good title<br />\nfor the remarks it is my duty to<br />\nmake.

Adams. I refer to the<br />\nac of Thomas Jefferson in seriously<br />\nproposing `to translate the Academy<br />\nof Geneva in a body to this country;'<br />\nto transplant the institution, root and<br />\nbranch, from its native soil to that<br />\nof Virginia. 'While upon foreign<br />\niFs'ons in the interest of the United<br />\nStates,' writes Professor Adams,'Jefferson kept making inquiries into<br />\nthe best systems of university education in the Old World.' After expressing various judgments he finally<br />\nwrote, in the year 1791, as follows:<br />\n'With respect to the schools of Europe my mind is perfectly made up.<br />\nand on full inquiry. The best in the<br />\nOn the<br />\nworld is Edinburgh. . .<br />\ncontinent of Europe, no place is comparable to Geneva.' After his return<br />\nto America, it is reported that he<br />\nwas wont to speak of these universities as 'the two eyes of Europe.' Before that return, however, the academic repose of the University of Geneva became disturbed by reason of<br />\nhaving fallen into disfavor with the<br />\nrevolutionary party, and this circumqance led Jefferson somewhat precipitously to indulge the belief that<br />\nhe could, without detriment to either<br />\ntransplant cne of the eyes of<br />\nFurope into an American socket. But<br />\nWasihngton, to whom the plan was<br />\nat once submitted, disapproved of<br />\nsuch drastic surgery, and his arguments prevailed. The new country<br />\nwas not yet prepared for a national<br />\nuniversity, this was the implication.<br />\nand in no conceivable circumstances<br />\nnrYsablv, could such a mechanical<br />\ntransference ever be advantageous.<br />\n\"This extraord.nary incident conrec's the nan-es of crtivin. Washington, and .Terferson, three oc<br />\ne-,:nent advocates of the University<br />\nas an indisnensable factor in the<br />\neconomy of the Commonwealth. Jefferson surveyed his life and concluded with the wish that future generaCons might know him for the accomnlishemnt of three acts of public<br />\ncerv:ce : the composition of the Decnf Independence. the corwepr:n., of tbe statute of Virginia for<br />\n,<br />\nreliffiotts freedom, and the foundin;'<br />\nnf the University of Virginia. Wash:n-ton served as chancellor of the<br />\nrenege of William and Mary from<br />\nti\u2014e nreceding his presidency of<br />\n5 Trifeti States to the end of his<br />\n1;fe; and he was the father of the<br />\nidea of a nat'onal university.

In<br />\nother words, is it not deeply true that<br />\nour Founder's Day must always be<br />\nspecifically commemorative of these<br />\nthree men, high-priests in the service<br />\nof human progress? And if we hearken to the teaching of their lives, interpreting the culminating aim of<br />\ntheir most devoted efforts, we shall<br />\nbe freshly admonished, from year to<br />\nyear, that a commonwealth derives<br />\nits highest power and surest distinction from its university.\"<br /><br />\nPRINTING THESES<br />\nNeatly and 'cheaply.<br />\ne have<br />\nhad plenty of 'experience and<br />\nknow what you need.<br />\nSend us your Ms. for an es:imate.<br />\nThe Chemical Publishing Co.<br />\nEaston, Pa.<br />\nTHOMAS &amp; THOMPSON CO.<br />\nMANUFAC1tjk,g<br /><br />\nPURE<br /><br />\nCorner<br /><br />\nLight<br /><br />\nDISer.NsERS OF<br /><br />\nJ11 EDIC1NES<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nBaltimore<br /><br />\nStreets<br /><br />\nWholesale and Retail.
