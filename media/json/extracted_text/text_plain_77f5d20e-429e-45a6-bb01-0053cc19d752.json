Calvert St., Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., FEBRUARY 16, 1926.<br />\n<br />\nMORE ON CUTS<br />\nSuch a large and entirely favorable body of comment hits<br />\nbeen aroused by our recent editorial, \"Unlimited Cuts,\" that<br />\nwe feel that the matter should be brought again to the attention of the Univeristy authorities. When student opinion is<br />\nstrongly behind a proposal for remodeling a rule or regulation,<br />\nit cannot be very well ignored; the powers that be should take<br />\naction one way or the other upon the scheme.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER'S reasons for advocating unlimited cuts<br />\nfor the two upper classes are, we believe, logical, and the idea<br />\nis certainly not of a radical nature. By the time a man has<br />\nentered the Junior year he should be fairly well matured; at<br />\nleast he should be given more freedom than he has previously<br />\nhad. It is merely training for the greater freedom of the workaday world. Now, if a student cannot sufficiently control his<br />\nimpulse to loaf to attend classes regularly, even though he has<br />\nno club over his head to make him do so, it seems to us that he<br />\nis unfit for university work, and his possible failure through<br />\nlack of attendance would be small loss. On the other hand, a<br />\nbright and energetic student can easily get the work of an average course done through outside reading, for, to quote our<br />\nprevious editorial, \"nine-tenths of all lectures are merely rehashes of matters which are treated fully in the texts.\" This<br />\nadditional freedom would give the enterprising student fuller<br />\nopportunities for study in whatever subject he happens to be<br />\nparticularly interested.<br />\nIt is to be noted further that the more forceful men of the<br />\nfaculty have no difficulty, even when they do not have the roll<br />\ntaken, in keeping up a large attendance. Witness the huge registration in certain elective courses. If a professor fears unlimited cuts it is not to be supposed that he is altruisticly<br />\nattentive to the supposed welfare of the students; it is more<br />\nlikely that he apprehends a marked decline in attendance upon<br />\nhis lectures,\u2014which would brand him as another \"dry as dust.\"<br />\nWe beieve that unlimited cuts would be quite in accordance with the Hopkins' ideal of freedom for students within<br />\nthe bounds of decency. Consequently, we call our proposal to<br />\nthe attention of the Student Council, and ask that they consider the question. If they act favorably upon the plan, they<br />\nshould take it up with the Dean; if they do not, the . NEWSLETTER, in spite of the obvious sentiment of the students, is<br />\nwilling to let the matter drop.<br />\n<br />\nLANIER MEMORIAL<br />\nThe letter of Dr. Knight Dunlap, advocating a permanent<br />\nand substantial memorial to Sidney Lanier, is very much to the<br />\npoint. However, the NEWS-LETTER favors a little different type<br />\nof memorial.<br />\nInstead of a building, which would be both costly and not<br />\nentirely necessary, we propose that a Lanier Book Fund, a<br />\nLanier Professorship of American Literature, or- a\u2022Lanier Room<br />\nbe established. The second of these would be very expensive; at<br />\nleast two hundred thousand dollars would be required for endowment; the last would alone be inadequate; so we are forced<br />\nto recommend the Book Fund as th most practical plan.<br />\nThe *ay in which,the Gilman Book Fund is working would<br />\nseem to be sufficient indication that a Lanier Fund would provide a real memorial to the poet.<br />\n<br />\nturn -to thoughts of logic. We say \"thoughts of logic\" advisedly, because we are referring to a consideration of what the<br />\nprofessors are pleased to call \"logical questions and answers.\"<br />\nAs a reminder that there is logic and logic, we are printing a condensation of a portion of Cabell's \"The Cream of the<br />\nJest.\" Many, I fear, will seem to see in it a similarity to the<br />\nthought processes of the examination. The difference, of course,<br />\nis obvious: Mr. Cabell's reasoning is charming.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n\"Progress through irrational and astounding blunders,<br />\nwhose outrageousness bedwarfs the wildest cliches of romance,<br />\nwas what Kennaston found everywhere.<br />\n\"Just as men's lives seem like many infinitesimal threads<br />\nwoven into the pattern of human destiny, so . . . the existence<br />\nof mankind upon the earth was but an incident in the unending<br />\nstruggle of life to find a home in the universe. Human inhabitancy was not even a very important phase in this world's<br />\nhistory, perhaps; a scant score or so of centuries ago there had<br />\nbeen no life on earth, and by and by the planet would be a<br />\nsilent, naked, frozeri clod. Would this sphere have served its<br />\nreal purpose of being, by having afforded foothold to life for a<br />\nfew years? For life was not a part of the universe at all perhaps, but rather, an intruder into the cosmic machinery, which<br />\nmoved along without any consideration of life's needs.<br />\n\"Toward what end did life aspire? . . . an intruder, a<br />\ntemporary visitor, in the big, moving, soulless mechanism of<br />\nearth and water and planets and suns and interlocking solar<br />\nsystems.

Calvert St., Baltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., FEBRUARY 16, 1926.<br /><br />\nMORE ON CUTS<br />\nSuch a large and entirely favorable body of comment hits<br />\nbeen aroused by our recent editorial, \"Unlimited Cuts,\" that<br />\nwe feel that the matter should be brought again to the attention of the Univeristy authorities. When student opinion is<br />\nstrongly behind a proposal for remodeling a rule or regulation,<br />\nit cannot be very well ignored; the powers that be should take<br />\naction one way or the other upon the scheme.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER'S reasons for advocating unlimited cuts<br />\nfor the two upper classes are, we believe, logical, and the idea<br />\nis certainly not of a radical nature. By the time a man has<br />\nentered the Junior year he should be fairly well matured; at<br />\nleast he should be given more freedom than he has previously<br />\nhad. It is merely training for the greater freedom of the workaday world. Now, if a student cannot sufficiently control his<br />\nimpulse to loaf to attend classes regularly, even though he has<br />\nno club over his head to make him do so, it seems to us that he<br />\nis unfit for university work, and his possible failure through<br />\nlack of attendance would be small loss. On the other hand, a<br />\nbright and energetic student can easily get the work of an average course done through outside reading, for, to quote our<br />\nprevious editorial, \"nine-tenths of all lectures are merely rehashes of matters which are treated fully in the texts.\" This<br />\nadditional freedom would give the enterprising student fuller<br />\nopportunities for study in whatever subject he happens to be<br />\nparticularly interested.<br />\nIt is to be noted further that the more forceful men of the<br />\nfaculty have no difficulty, even when they do not have the roll<br />\ntaken, in keeping up a large attendance. Witness the huge registration in certain elective courses. If a professor fears unlimited cuts it is not to be supposed that he is altruisticly<br />\nattentive to the supposed welfare of the students; it is more<br />\nlikely that he apprehends a marked decline in attendance upon<br />\nhis lectures,\u2014which would brand him as another \"dry as dust.\"<br />\nWe beieve that unlimited cuts would be quite in accordance with the Hopkins' ideal of freedom for students within<br />\nthe bounds of decency. Consequently, we call our proposal to<br />\nthe attention of the Student Council, and ask that they consider the question. If they act favorably upon the plan, they<br />\nshould take it up with the Dean; if they do not, the . NEWSLETTER, in spite of the obvious sentiment of the students, is<br />\nwilling to let the matter drop.<br /><br />\nLANIER MEMORIAL<br />\nThe letter of Dr. Knight Dunlap, advocating a permanent<br />\nand substantial memorial to Sidney Lanier, is very much to the<br />\npoint. However, the NEWS-LETTER favors a little different type<br />\nof memorial.<br />\nInstead of a building, which would be both costly and not<br />\nentirely necessary, we propose that a Lanier Book Fund, a<br />\nLanier Professorship of American Literature, or- a\u2022Lanier Room<br />\nbe established. The second of these would be very expensive; at<br />\nleast two hundred thousand dollars would be required for endowment; the last would alone be inadequate; so we are forced<br />\nto recommend the Book Fund as th most practical plan.<br />\nThe *ay in which,the Gilman Book Fund is working would<br />\nseem to be sufficient indication that a Lanier Fund would provide a real memorial to the poet.<br /><br />\nturn -to thoughts of logic. We say \"thoughts of logic\" advisedly, because we are referring to a consideration of what the<br />\nprofessors are pleased to call \"logical questions and answers.\"<br />\nAs a reminder that there is logic and logic, we are printing a condensation of a portion of Cabell's \"The Cream of the<br />\nJest.\" Many, I fear, will seem to see in it a similarity to the<br />\nthought processes of the examination. The difference, of course,<br />\nis obvious: Mr. Cabell's reasoning is charming.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n\"Progress through irrational and astounding blunders,<br />\nwhose outrageousness bedwarfs the wildest cliches of romance,<br />\nwas what Kennaston found everywhere.<br />\n\"Just as men's lives seem like many infinitesimal threads<br />\nwoven into the pattern of human destiny, so . . . the existence<br />\nof mankind upon the earth was but an incident in the unending<br />\nstruggle of life to find a home in the universe. Human inhabitancy was not even a very important phase in this world's<br />\nhistory, perhaps; a scant score or so of centuries ago there had<br />\nbeen no life on earth, and by and by the planet would be a<br />\nsilent, naked, frozeri clod. Would this sphere have served its<br />\nreal purpose of being, by having afforded foothold to life for a<br />\nfew years? For life was not a part of the universe at all perhaps, but rather, an intruder into the cosmic machinery, which<br />\nmoved along without any consideration of life's needs.<br />\n\"Toward what end did life aspire? . . . an intruder, a<br />\ntemporary visitor, in the big, moving, soulless mechanism of<br />\nearth and water and planets and suns and interlocking solar<br />\nsystems. The planet was so elaborately constructed . . . and<br />\nthe body that housed Felix Kennaston was so intricately<br />\nwrought with tiny bones and veins and sinews . . . that it<br />\nseemed unreasonable to suppose this much cunning mechanism<br />\nhad been set agoing aimlessly; and so he had often wondered<br />\nif he was not perhaps expected to devote these years to some<br />\nintelligible purpose?<br />\n\"But Kennaston could find little to attract him in any<br />\ntheory of the universe based on direct revelation from heaven.<br />\nConceding that divinity had actually stated so-and-so, from<br />\nSinai or Delphi or Mecca, and had been reported without miscomprehension or error, there was no particular reason for<br />\nbelieving that divinity had spoken veraciously; and, indeed, all<br />\navailable analogues went to show that nothing in nature dealt<br />\nwith its inferiors candidly.<br />\n\"To exercise for an allotted period divinely recommended<br />\nqualities known as virtues, and to be rewarded therefor, by an<br />\nimmortal score-keeper, appeared a rather childish performance<br />\nall around.<br />\n\"Under all theocracies the run of men proved much the<br />\nsame . . .
