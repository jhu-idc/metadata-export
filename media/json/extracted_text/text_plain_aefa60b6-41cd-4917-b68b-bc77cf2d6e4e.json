In addition to<br />\nwriting the handbook, Long is<br />\nthe author of On My Own, a<br />\nguide for kids when they're<br />\nhome alone.<br />\nLong has appeared on the<br />\nPhil Donahue Show where she<br />\nspoke about the problems<br />\nchildren encountered when they<br />\ncame home to an empty house.<br />\nLong and her husband are the<br />\nfounders of the National Institute for Latchkey Kids.<br />\nLong opened her presentation with a personal anecdote<br />\nfrom when she was a grade<br />\nschool principal in a private<br />\nschool in the Washington, D.C.<br />\narea. The school had very strict<br />\nrules, one of them being a dress<br />\ncode which required that<br />\nstudents not wear any jewelry.<br />\nDuring the time that she was a<br />\nprincipal, she observed that<br />\nmany children wore keys on<br />\nstrings around their necks. She<br />\nwas also cognizant of the fact<br />\nthat when children were bad,<br />\nand their parents were called<br />\nthere was no one home to<br />\nanswer the phone. In addition,<br />\nmany children were hanging<br />\nout at school once classes let<br />\nout, instead of rushing home.<br />\nAs a result of these observations her interest in \"latchkey\"<br />\nkids increased. She and her husband did research on the topic<br />\nand interviewed all the students<br />\nin her school. She found out<br />\nthat a third of these students<br />\nwent home alone each day, a<br />\nthird were picked up by their<br />\nparents, and a third went to day<br />\ncare centers.<br />\nOne of the questions Long<br />\nconsidered was what these kids<br />\ndid when they were home<br />\nalone. The typical routine did<br />\nnot differ much from<br />\nhousehold to household. Once<br />\nthe child arrived home, he or<br />\nshe would open the door and<br />\nthen lock it. Afterwards, many<br />\nof these children would call<br />\ntheir mom and let her know<br />\nthat they had arrived home<br />\nfrom school safely. Although<br />\nthe children were usually told to<br />\nstart their homework, most had<br />\na snack and watched television<br />\nuntil just before their parents<br />\nwere due to arrive home.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that<br />\nalthough every kid was told to<br />\ncall mom, many were unable to<br />\nreach their mothers, due to the<br />\ntype of work they did. One<br />\nthird of all the kids interviewed<br />\ncould not reach their parents<br />\nwhile they were home alone.<br />\nIn every household, parents<br />\ngave a set of rules to be followed<br />\nwhen they were not home.<br />\nThese rules did not differ<br />\nsignificantly from one family to<br />\nanother, and were: 1) lock the<br />\ndoor behind you; 2) not to open<br />\nthe door for anyone; 3) not to<br />\nuse the stove; 4) not to tell<br />\nanyone on the phone that<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nLynette Long, associate professor of education at the American University and author of the Handbook for Latchkey Kids and Their Parents.<br />\n<br />\nyou're home alone; 5) not to<br />\nhave friends over; 6) not to go<br />\noutside.<br />\nDespite the fact that these<br />\nrules were repeatedly drilled into the children's minds, according to Long, they were noi<br />\nalways upheld. In an Arizona<br />\nsurvey people went knocking<br />\non doors pretending to need a<br />\nglass of water or to use the<br />\ntelephone. Eighty percent of the<br />\nchildren tested let strangers in,<br />\nalthough they were told<br />\nspecifically not to.<br />\nAccording to Lonf, another<br />\nquestion that must be taken into consideration is whether or<br />\nnot latchkey kids are safe. It is<br />\na well known fact that kids<br />\nhave accidents. If a child is involved in an accident while at<br />\nhome alone, he must relate this<br />\nto his parents over the phone,<br />\nwho must then make an assessment as to the seriousness of<br />\nthe injury without seeing it.<br />\nOften a parent will not think an<br />\naccident is as serious as a child<br />\nmakes it appear and will pacify<br />\nthe child by saying that he will<br />\nlook at it when he gets home.<br />\nSometimes this response is<br />\nfine. Other times, if the accident is more serious than the<br />\nparent realizes, it is not.<br />\nAnother issue of major concern for parents is that of fire.<br />\nAccording to Long, although<br />\nalmost all kids are told not to<br />\nuse the stove, many do anyway.<br />\nIf a fire starts while a child is<br />\nhome alone, more often than<br />\nnot the child will try to put it<br />\nout or hide in a closet in the<br />\nhope that it will go away rather<br />\nthan calling his parents and<br />\nasking for help. Children are<br />\noften more afraid of their<br />\nparents' anger than of the fire.<br />\nIt is interesting.to note that a<br />\nsixth of all fires in the United<br />\nStates are started by kids who<br />\nare home alone.<br />\nLong is extremely interested<br />\nin the psychological effects on<br />\nchildren of going home to an<br />\nempty house. She did research<br />\non how kids felt about this. In<br />\ninterviewing children from first<br />\nthrough sixth grades, Long<br />\ndiscovered that every child interviewed was afriad at one<br />\n<br />\ntime or another, and that one<br />\nout of every three children was<br />\nafraid all the time. She gave examples of a third grade girl who<br />\nhid in a closet every day until<br />\nher mother came home from<br />\nwork, and of a sixth grade boy<br />\nwho checked all the windows,<br />\ndoors, and under the beds<br />\nbefore he settled down to watch<br />\ntelex ision while clenching a<br />\nbaseball bat.<br />\nTwo other psychological effects of being home alone are<br />\nboredom and loneliness. Long<br />\nstated, \"that kids are in a<br />\ntechnological prison.\" They are<br />\nsurrounded by TV's, VCR's,<br />\nAtari Games, etc., and are still<br />\nlonely. But they are lonely for<br />\nhuman affection and companionship. Children did not<br />\nknow what to do with all their<br />\nfree time and the responsibility<br />\nthey were given. As a result of<br />\nthis loneliness and boredom<br />\nmany latchkey kids become<br />\ndepressed.<br />\nLong is advancing three<br />\nmethods to help combat the<br />\npsychological effects of coming<br />\nhome to an empty house. One<br />\nidea is to get a pet for the child.<br />\nAll the kids interviewed asked<br />\nfor a dog. By the type of dog<br />\na child asks for, you can<br />\ndecipher what has affected<br />\nthem psychologically.<br />\nAccording to Long, if a child<br />\nasks for two, big, black dogs,<br />\nwho bite everyone, then most<br />\nlikely they are scared of being<br />\nhome alone.<br />\nThe second method being put<br />\ninto effect are hotlines for latchkey kids. These phone lines<br />\nresponds to both emergency or<br />\nroutine phone calls, and are<br />\noften manned 24 hours a day.<br />\nThe third program, which is in<br />\nthe planning stage, is something.<br />\ncalled \"After school care,\"<br />\nwhere children will be able to<br />\nstay at school until 6 p.m.<br />\nThere is controversy over who<br />\nshould pay for this program,<br />\nand as to who should administer it. An opinion being<br />\nconsidered is for the school to<br />\nlease the space to a private day<br />\ncare program for a reasonable<br />\nprice.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nScholarship Info<br />\nThe Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York<br />\nhas offered graduate scholarships for study at accredited<br />\nScottish universities to promote cultural interchange<br />\nand goodwill between<br />\nScotland and the United<br />\nStates since 1960.<br />\nStudents graduating from<br />\naccredited colleges or universities within the U.S. are eligible provided their permanent<br />\nhome addresses lie within the<br />\ngeographic boundries of<br />\nPennsylvania, New Jersey,<br />\nNew York, and the New<br />\nEngland States.

To Freedom in S.A.'<br />\nby Bill Reisen<br />\n\"There are two different<br />\nkinds of medicine in South<br />\nAfrica,\" according to Pat<br />\nNaidoo. One is the official<br />\nmedical program, which includes modern, state-of-the-art<br />\nwhite hospitals equipped for<br />\noperations as complex as heart<br />\ntransplants. \"The other is for<br />\nthe majority of the population,\" he said, \"where even<br />\nbasic primary health, housing<br />\nand sanitation are lacking.\"<br />\nAnd Naidoo should know: as<br />\na student six weeks short of<br />\ncompleting a medical degree at<br />\nthe prestigious University of<br />\nNatal Medical School, he is<br />\nfamilar with the workings of<br />\nthe official system, where even<br />\nblack doctors are instructed<br />\nhow to care for first-world illnesses. \"They're preparing me<br />\nfor high tech medicine,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nBut as co-founder and chairman of a health clinic which<br />\nserves as primary health care<br />\ncenter for 20,000 squatter camp<br />\nresidents near Durban and<br />\n300,000 in surrounding<br />\ntownships, Naidoo also knows<br />\nthe health problems of a different South Africa.<br />\n\"There is a great problem,\"<br />\nhe said. \"On one side, health<br />\ncare is based on the high<br />\ntechnology of American<br />\nmedicine, but at the same time<br />\nmy people are dying of very<br />\ncommon illnesses...all things<br />\nthat could be prevented easily.\"<br />\n\"In our hospitals it is grossly overcrowded,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Patients lie on the floor<br />\nbecause there are not enough<br />\nbeds...but the white hospitals<br />\ncarry only one fourth of their<br />\ncapacity.\" At the clinic, CPR<br />\nmachines are needed, while<br />\nthere are unused machines in<br />\nwhite hospitals, he said.<br />\nPatrick Bond, a Hopkins<br />\ngraduate student who visited<br />\n<br />\nNaidoo in South Africa early by Bill Reisen<br />\nthis year, shared Naidoo's<br />\n\"The thing that impressed<br />\nassessment and praised his efme<br />\nmost about Pat [Naidoo]<br />\nforts to improve conditions for<br />\nblack South Africans. \"It's was that he was very commitincredible\u2014one has to see up ted to the struggle for freedom<br />\nclose the things he's doing,\" he in South Africa,\" said Levi<br />\nsaid. \"At the clinic they were Watkins, a cardiologist at<br />\nforced to work with practically Hopkins Medical School who<br />\nno resources.

Speaking at<br />\nHomewood on October 11, he<br />\nrebutted the argument that<br />\nblack South Africans are better<br />\nas a result of American Corporate investment.<br />\n\"First, I am against the pompous American attitude that<br />\nthey know what's best for us.<br />\nThey aren't even concerned<br />\nabout what we want,\" he said.<br />\nHe cited a Gallop poll published in the London Times which<br />\nreported that 77 percent of<br />\nSouth African Blacks favor<br />\ndivestment.<br />\nHe said that the results of the<br />\npoll were particularly meaningful because even voicing dissent in this way, blacks endanger themselves. \"The yearfling for freedom far outweighs<br />\nthe pain of sanctions,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nNaidoo said that of the 350<br />\nmultinational corporations<br />\noperating in South Africa, only 126 have signed the Sullivan<br />\nCode. Those 126 companies<br />\nemploy 64,700 South Africans,<br />\nwhich accounts for less than 1<br />\npercent of the black potential<br />\nwork force. He called corporate<br />\ncompliance with the Sullivan<br />\nagreement \"just an apology for<br />\nApartheid, that doesn't make<br />\nany change, but allows companies to keep operating in<br />\nSouth Africa.\"<br />\n<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nHall has also offered his<br />\nassistance, stressing that \"my<br />\nrole is very supportive,\" but<br />\nsaid that Naidoo must decide<br />\nhis own plans before he can<br />\nassist him in any specific way.<br />\n\"I'm pretty clear that he would<br />\nlike to finish his medical education, and I had the impression<br />\nthat one of his priorities was<br />\ncoming here, but I also know<br />\nthat there were other options he<br />\nwanted to explore,\" Hall said.<br />\nHall said that although<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller has not expressed an<br />\nopinion on Naidoo's situation,<br />\n\"in an overall sense, Muller is<br />\nvery concerned about the<br />\ndeplorable situation in South<br />\nAfrica.

Some council members criticised the proposal as vague. \"What is it that<br />\nyou want?\" one member asked Bond, who sponsored the<br />\nresolution.<br />\n\"We're asking for them to<br />\nfind some appropriate position<br />\nfor Pat at Hopkins,\" Bond<br />\n\u2022 replied. \"Beyond that, we leave<br />\nit up to them.

Cook addressed<br />\nRoosevelt's life from a feminist<br />\nperspective.<br />\nWhile Cook agreed with the<br />\ncommonly held view of Eleanor<br />\nRoosevelt as a gracious and<br />\nmerciful mother of five, she<br />\nadded that the myth of<br />\nRoosevelt that has been propagated through recent history<br />\nignores the political, proud,<br />\nbold, and dramatic elements of<br />\nher personality. \"Power and<br />\npolitics were her lifeblood,\"<br />\nsaid Cook.<br />\nCook supported her contention that Roosevelt was a<br />\nfeminist by quoting extensively from an article Roosevelt<br />\ncontributed to Redbook in<br />\n1928. In the article, Roosevelt<br />\n<br />\nwrote that women should select<br />\nfemale bosses to lead them into the political battleground.<br />\nThese \"bosses\" were to have<br />\nbeen strong women capable of<br />\nholding their own against the<br />\nmale bosses who controlled the<br />\npolitics of the time.

Once a bigot, she<br />\nbecame a proponent of the civil<br />\nrights movement. Cook illustrated Roosevelt's political<br />\ninsight with the fact that \"she<br />\nsuggested that food [control of<br />\nfood supply] should be used as<br />\na political ploy long before this<br />\nwas a popular notion.\"<br />\n\"ER was 'deviant' in the<br />\nsense that she defied authority<br />\nand convention,\" said Cook.<br />\n\"She was proud to be a<br />\nfeminist and was not afraid to<br />\nuse the<br />\nword,' \" Cook<br />\nquipped.<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachanoran<br />\n<br />\nBlanche Wiesen Cook, professor of history at John Jay College and author of Eisenhower Declassified and<br />\nEleanor Roosevelt: Women, Power and Politics.<br />\n<br />\nA HOPKINS TRADITION<br />\n<br />\n1HIOMEWOOD DELLI<br />\n3105 ST.

Folks around here<br />\nusually plod along without much more<br />\nthan a nod to the outside world. But in<br />\nthe last couple of weeks even the racial<br />\nunrest of South Africa seems to have<br />\ntouched Homewood.<br />\nIt did so in the person of Pat Naidoo,<br />\na South African student activist who,<br />\nwhen forced to flee his own country or<br />\nbe thrown in jail, made his way here. A<br />\nmedical student in South Africa, Naidoo<br />\nhas apparently considered applying to<br />\nHopkins and completing his M.D. here<br />\n(he was only a few weeks from doing so in<br />\nSouth Africa when he was forced to go<br />\nunderground).<br />\nLed by Patrick Bond, a grad student<br />\nwho met Naidoo on a trip to South<br />\nAfrica in January, the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization passed a<br />\nresolution pledging support to Naidoo<br />\nand urging the university to give him<br />\n\"every possible consideration for<br />\nassistance.\" Apparently that means<br />\neither admitting Naidoo or offering him<br />\nsome sort of a research job while he goes<br />\nthrough the lengthy process of getting<br />\npolitical asylum.<br />\nBond then took his campaign to the<br />\nStudent Council. But still smarting from<br />\nits last jaunt into South African<br />\npolitics\u2014its endorsement of the class<br />\nboycott a couple weeks ago\u2014 the Council hemmed and hawed, and then decided to do nothing at all.<br />\nThe university's response to all this<br />\nisn't exactly clear. Norman Anderson,<br />\ndean of admissions at the medical<br />\n<br />\nschool, said Naidoo has been \"encouraged to clarify his visa status.\" That sort<br />\nof misses the point, of course, which is<br />\nthat Naidoo needs to know where he will<br />\nbe studying before he can \"clarify his<br />\nvisa status.\" It's true that Naidoo's supporters haven't really asked for anything<br />\nspecific (the GRO resolution quoted<br />\nabove, for example, is a remarkable<br />\ntestimonial to imprecision), but the<br />\nuniversity should\u2014for a couple of<br />\nreasons\u2014make an extra effort in<br />\nNaidoo's case.<br />\nFirst, Naidoo offers a chance for the<br />\nuniversity to make a not unimportant<br />\nstatement of opposition to apartheid by<br />\nembracing one of its victims. Bond's<br />\nrather strange argument that helping<br />\nNaidoo will in some way make up for<br />\n\"the years of profiting from its investments in apartheid\" is more than a<br />\nlittle unclear, but assisting those injured<br />\nby an evil system is clearly noble. Second, and in some ways more importantly, if the university is serious in what it<br />\nsays about wanting \"well-rounded\"<br />\nmedical students, Naidoo would seem<br />\nthe perfect applicant.<br />\nWe're hardly competent to make<br />\nmedical school admissions decisions, and<br />\nwe're certainly not arguing that academic<br />\nstandards should be lowered. Our point<br />\nis merely that the university should be<br />\nwilling to go the extra mile to assist<br />\nNaidoo. If admitting him to the medical<br />\nschool isn't feasible, then some sort of<br />\nresearch job or fellowship ought to be<br />\noffered. One way or another, Naidoo<br />\ndeserves some help.<br />\n<br />\nAre Hopkins Students Slobs?<br />\nMust Hopkins students be treated like<br />\ncomplete children? Apparently so. They<br />\ncan't seem to clean up after themselves.<br />\nTo be specific, student groups are back<br />\nto their old tricks: they're sticking up<br />\nposters everywhere. The campus is beginning to look so much like a garbage<br />\ndump, in fact, that the Student Council<br />\nfelt compelled to take up the matter<br />\nrecently at one of its meetings. Posters<br />\nare being plastered all over the place, said<br />\nStudent Activities Commission Chair'man Alan Rebenstock.<br />\nAs anyone who's been around a few<br />\nyears knows, the problem is hardly new.<br />\nIn fact, it was the sloppy look of the<br />\ncampus that prompted the SAC to adopt<br />\na new (and quite strict) poster policy last<br />\nyear. The problem was much worse then:<br />\nat election time candidates(or their supporters) would use hundreds of posters.<br />\nIn the finest monument to slovenliness,<br />\na few jerks would always put up several<br />\ndozen posters on the brick facade of the<br />\nsteps between the upper and lower<br />\nquads\u2014arranged in their name, or their<br />\ninitials, or the year of their class.<br />\nThat caused the SAC to adopt a new<br />\npolicy on postering, which essentially<br />\nallows only one poster per bulletin.<br />\nboard, and prohibits them elsewhere. It<br />\n<br />\nis this policy the Council is now seeking<br />\nto enforce more firmly.<br />\nThe worst thing about this, of course,<br />\nis that it's all patently silly. The Student<br />\nCouncil shouldn't have to waste its time<br />\non this. Neither, for that matter, should<br />\nthe SAC. Quite simply, students<br />\nshouldn't be such slobs that they have<br />\nto be told not to stick posters on doors<br />\nor windows or columns.<br />\nThe matter isn't a crucial one. It's not<br />\na tuition increase or an apartheid<br />\nboycott. The point is merely that there's<br />\nno reason to stick a thousand posters all<br />\nover the campus. Nobody wants the<br />\nplace to look like a pig sty, and surely<br />\nenough publicity is generated by posters<br />\non bulletin boards.<br />\nSo in the future, if you see a poster<br />\nstuck on a wall where it doesn't belong,<br />\ndo two things. First, rip it down. Second,<br />\ndon't go to the event. Maybe then groups<br />\nwill learn that making the campus more<br />\nugly is counter-productive.<br />\nAnd if you're in a student group or a<br />\nfrat or you help run one of the film<br />\nseries, don't be a slob. Maybe then the<br />\nCouncil and the SAC and everybody else<br />\ncan quit worrying about posters\u2014and<br />\nget on to important matters.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the first days of my<br />\nfreshman year I was brought to<br />\nlisten to the president of our<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nI remember him saying that<br />\nwe make the competition for<br />\nourselves, and that Hopkins<br />\ndoes not have to be the mill that<br />\nit is. He said that students<br />\nshould help each other and<br />\n<br />\nthe assistance of the administrative cadres, is taking<br />\naway from the students one<br />\nmeans by which to be released<br />\nfrom the daily academic ins and<br />\nouts. This is not just an isolated<br />\nexample. The ham radio shack<br />\nand last semester's Hutzler<br />\nreading room controversy are<br />\nother examples of the ad-<br />\n<br />\njoe chen<br />\nshould try to broaden their<br />\nacademic experiences beyond<br />\nour intended specialties.<br />\nI believed him for a while,<br />\nbut then I realized there were<br />\nglaring inconsistencies between<br />\nhis rhetoric and what Hopkins<br />\nis. I eventually realized that the<br />\nproblem was not the students'<br />\nfault. Rather, it was the administration itself which<br />\ncreated the problem and is<br />\nperpetuating it.<br />\nIt seems surprising that this<br />\nis the case, since the president<br />\nof the university has made such<br />\npublic pleas for the broadening<br />\nof students' interests, and has<br />\nheaded committees studying the<br />\nAmerican educational system<br />\nfrom various viewpoints. Yet,<br />\nunfortunately it is apparent that<br />\nthese words and acts ring<br />\nhollow.<br />\nA case in point is the impending doom of the studentmanaged radio station, WJHU.<br />\nAlthough perhaps too many<br />\nwords have been written on this<br />\nsubject, it perfectly illustrates<br />\nhere on<br />\nproblem<br />\nthe<br />\nHomewood. Where Muller has<br />\nstated that he feels students are<br />\nbecoming too narrowly minded<br />\nand careerist in nature, he, with<br />\n<br />\nministration's indifference to<br />\nand<br />\nwelfare,<br />\nstudent<br />\non<br />\nlife<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nBut why is it that the administration is so callous in student affairs? Quite simply, it<br />\nhas to do with status. It is obvious that the administration of<br />\nthe university is in many instances blindly plunging ahead<br />\nfor status. The future sculpture<br />\ngarden, a professional radio<br />\nstation, and the failed attempt<br />\nat a rare books collection are<br />\nexamples of the administration's search for national<br />\nrecognition.<br />\nWhat they don't realize,<br />\nhowever, is that it is not the<br />\nedifice that is important, but<br />\nthe people. Universities do not<br />\ngain recognition through the<br />\nconstruction of buildings, or<br />\nthe public relations image that<br />\nthey create. Rather, they gain<br />\nprominence by the people involved. In particular, the<br />\nstudents they educate. It seems<br />\nas though the present trustees<br />\nand the administration have<br />\nlost the vision which Johns<br />\nHopkins had for the university.<br />\nContinued on Page 10<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nEditor<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nMary Ginder<br />\nProduct:on Manager<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nT.J.

Police massed outside<br />\nthe Consulate and arrested 16<br />\nstudents.

Outdoor<br />\ndemonstrations are strictly prohibited in South Africa.<br />\nNonetheless, three days later<br />\nNaidoo and the other student<br />\nleaders decided to bring 5000<br />\nstudents from the whole Durban region together in the town<br />\ncenter for a mass protest. The<br />\ndemonstration was a great success, if only as a result of the<br />\ninternational media coverage<br />\nwhich reported clear internal<br />\npolitical opposition.<br />\nBecause his calls for<br />\neconomic boycotts\u2014against<br />\nbusinesses,<br />\nwhite-owned<br />\nagainst U.S. companies doing<br />\nbusiness in South Africa, and<br />\nagainst the country itself\u2014are<br />\nconsidered treason, potentially<br />\npunishable by death (certainly<br />\na minimum of ten years in<br />\nprison), Naidoo was forced to<br />\ngo underground.<br />\nFrom that vantage point he<br />\nsaw the government manipulate<br />\nso-called Indians and Zulu<br />\ntribespeople into engaging in<br />\ncivil war.

We disagree.<br />\nCurrently, WJHU is managed and operated entirely by<br />\nstudents and other community<br />\nvolunteers. The station's officers and directors are elected<br />\nby station member from among<br />\nthemselves. Station members<br />\nare involved in musical programming, news production,<br />\nengineering, public affairs programming, sports coverage,<br />\npublicity and all other aspects<br />\nof running a radio station. Interested students and other<br />\ncommunity members are<br />\nalways welcome to participate.<br />\nMoreover, members can contribute as much or as little time<br />\nas they are able.<br />\nNorris feels that efforts to<br />\nensure the continued existence<br />\nof a student-run radio station<br />\nare very premature; that we are<br />\noperating under the mistaken<br />\nassumption that it will not be<br />\npossible for students to participate fully in the station.<br />\nNorris is correct about our<br />\nassumptions. The key word<br />\nhere is \"fully\"; we and Norris<br />\nseem to disagree on the meaning of full participation.<br />\nNorris feels that the three<br />\npart-time positions targeted<br />\n<br />\nCreagh pointed out that<br />\nwhether or not the announcers<br />\nare students is a matter of slim<br />\nconcern to the listener,<br />\nalthough it makes a great deal<br />\nof difference to the students.<br />\nWe agree entirely. We're a very<br />\nselfish group. We, the students,<br />\nwant WJHU all to ourselves. Is<br />\nthat attitude unreasonable?<br />\nCertainly not. That's what<br />\nWJHU is all about. Students.<br />\nIf we win awards for our performance along the way, that's<br />\nfine too. But when we're told<br />\nthat students can't or shouldn't<br />\nbe allowed to operate a radio<br />\nstation, we feel injured, and<br />\nrightly so.<br />\nWe agree with Creagh when<br />\nhe suggests that the university's<br />\nconcern was largely for the audience, as opposed to the staff<br />\nof the ten-watt audience. When<br />\nasked about the decision to turn<br />\nWJHU into a professional station, administration officials<br />\ninvariably mention the university's obligation to meet the<br />\nneeds of the expanded<br />\nBaltimore-Washington listening<br />\naudience the new WJHU will<br />\nhave. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity has no less of an<br />\nobligation to its students.<br />\nThe administration should<br />\nmake a determined effort to<br />\nallow true student radio to continue at Hopkins. We're not<br />\nlooking for jobs in the new<br />\n<br />\nWJHU. That sort of restricted<br />\nparticipation doesn't appeal to<br />\nus. There are just too many<br />\nstudents and community<br />\nmembers who invest a great<br />\ndeal of time and effort in the<br />\nis<br />\nWJHU. It<br />\ncurrent<br />\nreproachable for the university<br />\nto turn its back on us.<br />\nIt is quite clear that the<br />\nplans for the new WJHU have<br />\nbeen set. A professional<br />\nmanager has been hired, offcampus radio space has been<br />\nfound, and contracts have been<br />\nsigned. What hope is left for<br />\nthe students? Well, there is one<br />\nthing. The university can provide funding for the continued<br />\noperation of the student-run<br />\nstation on another frequency.<br />\nAccording to Norris, the<br />\ndecision to have a professionally managed station was not<br />\ndriven by consideration of the<br />\nexisting WJHU budget. In that<br />\ncase, why not let WJHU keep<br />\nits old budget? Besides, it is only fair that the university should<br />\nhelp WJHU in its effort to slide<br />\nalong the radio dial, considering the fact that it was WJHU<br />\nmembers who handled the entire 25,000 watt increase in the<br />\nfirst place. Of course, at the<br />\ntime, the members of the<br />\nmanaging board had no idea<br />\nthat the new station would be<br />\ncompletely professionally<br />\nmanaged.

The poster<br />\npolicy does not restrict postering to certain bulletin boards,<br />\nbut restricts postering only to<br />\nbulletin boards, i.e. posters<br />\nmay not be put on doors, windows, and columns. Also, the<br />\npolicy does not require that<br />\ngroups remove their posters<br />\nafter the event. While this idea<br />\nmay be a worthwile addition to<br />\nthe current policy, at this time,<br />\na student is hired to clear the<br />\nbulletin boards of outdated<br />\nposters.<br />\nTherefore, for the edification<br />\nposterers<br />\nall<br />\nover<br />\nof<br />\nHomewood, the poster policy,<br />\nas published in the SAC Pro-<br />\n<br />\ncedures Manual, is as follows:<br />\n1. All posters must be placed on<br />\nbulletin boards only. Only one<br />\nposter per board per event is<br />\npermitted.<br />\n2. Each poster should have a<br />\nclearly marked expiration date.<br />\n3. Each poster must be affixed<br />\nwith thumbtacks or tape, not<br />\nstaples.<br />\n4. A fine of one dollar will be<br />\nassessed for each illegal poster,<br />\nthis includes both posters that<br />\nare not on bulletin boards and<br />\nexcessive postering on a bulletin<br />\nboard.

Despite the increased<br />\nfinancial resources, Chester's<br />\nPlace is in deep trouble.<br />\nIn the past, Chester's attracted a healthy mixture of<br />\nundergrads, grads, and community people.

For<br />\n$9.95 not only do you get<br />\neverything you always wanted<br />\nto know about boomerangs but<br />\nwere afraid to ask, out your<br />\nvery own magical plastic orange<br />\nand blue returning boomerang.<br />\nWhat a bargain!<br />\nOnce you've spent a couple<br />\nof minutes reading about position, grip, aim, lift and launch<br />\nyou'll be ranging in no time.<br />\nOne thing the book insists on is<br />\nthat you follow the warning on<br />\nthe back cover, the inside front<br />\npage and somewhere else in the<br />\nbook which specifically states<br />\nthat you shouldn't throw a<br />\nboomerang without reading the<br />\nbasic safety rules. Some ot<br />\nthese so called rules are silly;<br />\n<br />\nlike \"wear sunglasses when<br />\nthrowing in bright condi\"be<br />\ntions.\"(no.7) and<br />\ncourteous at all times.\"(no.8)<br />\nTo whom, your boomerang or<br />\nthe guy you just hit and is ready<br />\nto feed you the boomerang?<br />\nBut read them anyway because<br />\nthey make sense and because I<br />\ndidn't and therefore paid.<br />\nBasic safety rule no. 1 states,<br />\n\"The playing field should be<br />\nlarge, flat, free of holes and<br />\nobstructions such as rocks and<br />\ntrees...beaches, parks...are unthrowing<br />\nsuitable<br />\nfor<br />\nboomerangs.\" On the beach, in<br />\nfront of MSE, I had to risk life<br />\nand limb retrieving a bright<br />\npiece of plastic from .a tree.<br />\nWorse yet a really nice girl borrowed a broom from the library<br />\nto help out, and was slightly insulted when someone asked if<br />\nshe was going to sweep or take<br />\na ride on it.<br />\nOK, after a little practice<br />\nyou've got down the minor<br />\nmiracle, \"it spins outward, tests<br />\nthe breeze, curves and climbs<br />\nand obediently comes winging<br />\nhome, whispering as it flies<br />\nclose and hovers softly down to<br />\nyour hands.\" So it does, mostly! But not only do you learn to<br />\nthrow and catch as the book's<br />\ntitle suggests but its hundred<br />\npages are also full of the<br />\n<br />\nhistory, the styles and forms,<br />\nthe competitions, and yes, the<br />\ntheory behind boomerangs.<br />\nSome of the myths about<br />\nboomerangs are dispelled.<br />\n\"Boomerangs were used by the<br />\naborigines to kill big game and<br />\nkangaroos.\" Not true. A<br />\nrelative of the boomerang, the<br />\nnonreturnable killing stick, was<br />\nthe device used for this purpose. So one asks what purpose<br />\ndid the boomerang serve in<br />\nAborigine culture? Well., it has<br />\nvarious functions from bird<br />\nhunting, to rituals, to making<br />\na fire.<br />\nStyles and forms are incredibly varied. From the<br />\nclassic two blader to the six<br />\nblader, which is a little difficult<br />\nto catch. Numerous pictures<br />\ndisplay the many different<br />\nkinds. One page covers the different carvings possible;<br />\ntomahawks, human shapes, letters, animals and other weird<br />\nshapes.<br />\nOne section deals with the<br />\nconstruction of your own<br />\nboomerang. For those inclined<br />\nto try, three different designs<br />\nare included. I haven't made<br />\nmy own yet, only because 1<br />\nhaven't bought the plywood<br />\nyet! You need a few basic tools<br />\nand several hours of work to<br />\ngain in return the satisfaction of<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\n<br />\nThe author in the infamous tree in front of the MSE.<br />\n<br />\nhaving made something artistically beautiful with your<br />\nown two hands. You can follow<br />\nyour own designs and even<br />\nmake a night rang.<br />\nOnce you've acquired a little<br />\nskill, the last chapter contains<br />\ninformation on competitions,<br />\nstarting your own club, and<br />\nsome interesting games. You<br />\ncan learn how to throw two<br />\nboomerangs at the same time or<br />\nif you practice for a very, very,<br />\nlong time try the William Tell<br />\nstunt. The thrower launches the<br />\nboomerang and on the return it<br />\nslices an apple off his head. The<br />\n<br />\nbook even has a picture of this<br />\namazing stunt.<br />\nAs for me, I've fallen in love<br />\nwith the sport. I've bought<br />\nanother boomerang and a tube<br />\nof Ben-Gay for my sore<br />\nshoulders. If you're interested<br />\nyou can buy your own book at<br />\nthe Australia shop in the Innei<br />\nHarbor.

A<br />\ngeneral recession had replaced<br />\nall traces of post-war prosperity present in the sixties and the<br />\nseventies.

This discovery spawned<br />\na \"veritable explosion\" of further research into genetic<br />\ndisorders. The techniques of<br />\nseparating chromosomes for examination improved considerably over the years through<br />\nthe development of a method of<br />\n\"banding\" chromosomes (i.e.,<br />\nmaking visible specific markings or bands on individual<br />\nchromosomes), allowing the<br />\nGanesh Ramactianatan<br />\ngeneticist to distinguish betthe<br />\nand<br />\nGenetics<br />\n'Modern<br />\nlecture<br />\nDr. Victor McKusic giving a recent<br />\nween them; this technique was<br />\nHuman Condition.<br />\n<br />\nby Antara Mallampalli<br />\n<br />\ntalk was entitled \"Modern<br />\nGenetics and the Human Condition,\" and comprised an interesting and informative lecture and slide presentation dealmajor<br />\nthe<br />\nwith<br />\ning<br />\ndevelopments in medical<br />\ngenetics in recent years and<br />\nsome of the applications of<br />\nthese advances.<br />\nDr. McKusick explained at<br />\n<br />\nsubsequently refined to allow<br />\nhigher resolution and better picof<br />\ntures<br />\nindividual<br />\nchromosomes. Dr. McKusick<br />\nexplained that the \"bands,\" of<br />\nwhich there may be as many as<br />\nseven or eight hundred,<br />\ncharacterize the physical appearance of the chromosomes<br />\nbut are not themselves genes. In<br />\nfact it is estimated that there are<br />\nsome 50,000 to 100,000 genes<br />\non each chromosome, so the<br />\nbands themselves consist of<br />\nlarge numbers of genes.<br />\nDr. McKusick explained<br />\nthat, in general, genetic<br />\ndisorders can be classified into<br />\nthree categories. The first of<br />\nthese includes simple gene<br />\ndisorders following conventional Mendelian pedigree patterns; the second category consists of \"multifactorial<br />\ndisorders,\" relatively common<br />\nconditions like hypertension,<br />\nwhich seem to show no simple<br />\ninheritance patterns; and the<br />\nthird group is made up of gross<br />\nchromosomal aberrations involving complex malformations<br />\nof chromosomes.

It has<br />\nalso been theorized that the accumulation of somatic cell<br />\nmutations in non-reproducing<br />\ncells, such as cells of the nervous system, is one factor<br />\nresponsible for aging. In addition, Dr. McKusick noted that<br />\n\"some congenital malformations may be local somatic cell<br />\nmutations in developing cells.\"<br />\nTo illustrate the immense<br />\ngrowth in recent years of<br />\n\"genetic nosology\"\u2014the<br />\nclassification of separate types<br />\nof genetic disorders\u2014Dr.<br />\nMcKusick displayed a slide<br />\nshowing the steadily increasing<br />\nsize of the past six editions of<br />\nhis book, Mendelian Inheritance in Man, which he<br />\ndescribed as \"a catalog by locus<br />\nof all the human genes known<br />\nto man.\u2014 Dr. McKusick<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br />\n<br />\nIt's Time Again for The Great American Smokeout<br />\nby John Lafferty<br />\nThe American Cancer Society(ACS)is trying once again to<br />\nclear the air between smokers<br />\nand nonsmokers with its Great<br />\nAmerican Smokeout day on<br />\nThursday. November 21. It is<br />\non this day that many smokers<br />\nnationwide will start the habit<br />\nof breathing fresh air for a<br />\nwhole day. This of course, is a<br />\ngood habit\u2014one breath and<br />\nyou're hooked. In last year's<br />\nsmokeout, 37.7 percent of the<br />\nnation's females and 28.8 percent of male smokers paradd<br />\nwhich<br />\nticipated,<br />\nof<br />\nnumber<br />\nthe<br />\nto<br />\nsignificantly<br />\npeople who have quit smoking.<br />\nFrom 1978 to 1984, the ranks of<br />\nformer smokers increased from<br />\n31.5 million to more than 35<br />\nmillion. In fact, smoking on the<br />\nwhole is declining. Cigarette<br />\noutput was at 661 billion for<br />\n1983-1984, down 2.5 percent<br />\nfrom the year before. Consumption of cigarettes during<br />\nthe same period dropped about<br />\n3.5 percent. About 54 million<br />\nAmericans still smoke, and<br />\nsurveys show that 85 percent of<br />\nsmokers would like to quit and<br />\nabout 100 percent of<br />\nnonsmokers want the smokers<br />\nto quit. Many smokers have<br />\ntried to quit at least once. With<br />\nthese statistics in hand, the ACS<br />\nwill try even harder this year to<br />\nget across its message to stop<br />\nsmoking.<br />\nThe machine behind this<br />\ncampaign, the ACS, began in<br />\n1913. Back then, the word<br />\n\"cancer\" was rarely heard.<br />\nThere was little research done<br />\nand the disease was assumed to<br />\n<br />\nbe incurable. This, of course,<br />\nhas changed. The cancer survival rate is about 46 percent in<br />\nthe U.S., and with present<br />\nknowledge and treatments, it is<br />\ntheoretically possible to save<br />\nsome 55 percent of all patients,<br />\naccording to the ACS. It is<br />\nundeniable with its 2 million<br />\nAmerican volunteers and its<br />\nhuge research program, all<br />\nworking toward the elimination<br />\nof cancer entirely as a human<br />\ndisease.<br />\nThe 1982 Surgeon General's<br />\nReport stated that cigarette<br />\nsmoking is the major single<br />\ncause of cancer mortality in the<br />\nUnited States. Smoking causes<br />\nnot only lung cancer, but<br />\ncancers of the larynx, oral cavity, and esophagus. With all<br />\nthose cancers cause by any one<br />\nof the over 4000 isolated<br />\npoisons found in cigarettes,<br />\nwhy do smokers continue to<br />\nharm themselves as well as<br />\nthose around them? The reason<br />\nis that smokers are addicted to<br />\nthe nicotine found in processed tobacco products. The only<br />\nway that most smokers have<br />\nfound to break the habit is<br />\ncomplete cessation of smoking<br />\ncold turkey.<br />\nWhile cold turkey from<br />\ncigarettes has its clear<br />\nwithdrawal symptoms of irritability, anxiety, craving for<br />\ntobacco, and other symptoms,<br />\nNov. 21 need not be total<br />\nmisery for smokers. In fact, the<br />\nwhole idea behind the<br />\nSmokeout is to get nonsmokers<br />\ninto the act by helping smokers<br />\nto overcome the habit by hiding<br />\nashtrays, giving out all-day<br />\nsuckers, or even chocolate<br />\n<br />\ncigarettes. Many companies,<br />\nsuch as Bloomingdale's, Penzoil, General Electric, and<br />\nmany others have given out<br />\n\"Quit Survival Kits\" to their<br />\nemployees, and other incentives<br />\nto assist in the positive reinforcement of kicking the habit.<br />\nAt the Riverside Correctional<br />\n<br />\nFacility in Ionia, Michigan, 23<br />\npercent of the prison population attempted to \"trash their<br />\nash\" on Smokeout day. The<br />\n-hugging system,\" in which a<br />\nsmoker receives a hug from a<br />\nfriend instead of a cigarette, has<br />\nalso proved successful. There<br />\nare even contests among smok-<br />\n<br />\ning buddies to quit. So<br />\nnonsmokers, help out the<br />\nsmokers on Nov. 21 by adopting a smoker for the day and<br />\npromise to help that friend get<br />\nthrough the 24 hours without a<br />\ncigarette!<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\n<br />\nAdvances in Genetics Discussed<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\npointed out that the increasing<br />\nnumber of separate genetic entities known to man indirectly<br />\nreflects the vastness of human<br />\ngenetic heterogenity in general.<br />\nSome 800 genes, a small fraction of the estimated total<br />\nnumber, have thus far been<br />\nidentified in terms of their<br />\nprecise chromosome location.<br />\nDr. McKusick also pointed out<br />\nthat the huge amount of information that medical geneticists<br />\nhave accumulated has become<br />\navailable through four distinct<br />\nbut interrelated research<br />\nmethods\u2014linkage and family<br />\nstudies, chromosome studies,<br />\nsomatic cell hybridization, and<br />\nmolecular genetics studies; of<br />\nthese, the latter two have in recent years been the most productive.<br />\nDr. McKusick went on to<br />\ndiscuss two important aspects<br />\nof the \"anatomy\" of the<br />\nhuman gene\u2014the morbid, or<br />\npathological anatomy, and applied anatomy. In the context<br />\nof morbid gene anatomy, the<br />\nmapping (identifying the site)<br />\nof specific genes related to particular disorders(such as sicklecell anemia, Duchenne<br />\nmuscular dystrophy, or Huntington's Disease, to name a<br />\nfew)on specific chromosomes,<br />\nhas led to considerable excitement in the medical community since these discoveries make<br />\npossible diagnosis of certain<br />\ndisorders before symptoms are<br />\nmanifest, and also gave researchers a chance to discover<br />\nbiochemical<br />\nbasic<br />\nthe<br />\nmechanisms whereby some of<br />\nthese diseases develop.<br />\nAdvances in understanding<br />\nof the anatomy of the human<br />\ngene have given rise to important applications in what Dr.<br />\nMcKusick called \"diagnostic<br />\nbiopsy\" of the genes, which involves obtaining a blood sample from the patient, separating<br />\nthe white cells, and removing<br />\nthe DNA, which can then be<br />\nanalyzed to detect any lesions<br />\nthat might indicate specific<br />\ndisorders.<br />\nThis type of technique has<br />\nalready found a place in<br />\nprenatal diagnosis: the technique of amniocentesis presently<br />\nallows prediction in advance of<br />\ndisorders. Amcertain<br />\nniocentesis, which is possible<br />\nonly after 16 weeks of pregnancy, has since led to the development of the more refined<br />\nmethod of \"chorion villus<br />\nsampling,\" applicable after 9<br />\nweeks of gestation, which in-<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\nDental<br />\nReferral<br />\nService<br />\nwill find<br />\nthe dentist<br />\nthat's right<br />\nfor you'<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\nDental<br />\nReferral Service<br />\n3445<br />\n653<br />\n8_4<br />\n-F<br />\n<br />\nvolves inserting a catheter into applications of \"gene therapy\"<br />\nthe uterus to obtain a sample of (that is, the correcting of a<br />\nfetal genetic material.

In addition to<br />\nwriting the handbook, Long is<br />\nthe author of On My Own, a<br />\nguide for kids when they're<br />\nhome alone.<br />\nLong has appeared on the<br />\nPhil Donahue Show where she<br />\nspoke about the problems<br />\nchildren encountered when they<br />\ncame home to an empty house.<br />\nLong and her husband are the<br />\nfounders of the National Institute for Latchkey Kids.<br />\nLong opened her presentation with a personal anecdote<br />\nfrom when she was a grade<br />\nschool principal in a private<br />\nschool in the Washington, D.C.<br />\narea. The school had very strict<br />\nrules, one of them being a dress<br />\ncode which required that<br />\nstudents not wear any jewelry.<br />\nDuring the time that she was a<br />\nprincipal, she observed that<br />\nmany children wore keys on<br />\nstrings around their necks. She<br />\nwas also cognizant of the fact<br />\nthat when children were bad,<br />\nand their parents were called<br />\nthere was no one home to<br />\nanswer the phone. In addition,<br />\nmany children were hanging<br />\nout at school once classes let<br />\nout, instead of rushing home.<br />\nAs a result of these observations her interest in \"latchkey\"<br />\nkids increased. She and her husband did research on the topic<br />\nand interviewed all the students<br />\nin her school. She found out<br />\nthat a third of these students<br />\nwent home alone each day, a<br />\nthird were picked up by their<br />\nparents, and a third went to day<br />\ncare centers.<br />\nOne of the questions Long<br />\nconsidered was what these kids<br />\ndid when they were home<br />\nalone. The typical routine did<br />\nnot differ much from<br />\nhousehold to household. Once<br />\nthe child arrived home, he or<br />\nshe would open the door and<br />\nthen lock it. Afterwards, many<br />\nof these children would call<br />\ntheir mom and let her know<br />\nthat they had arrived home<br />\nfrom school safely. Although<br />\nthe children were usually told to<br />\nstart their homework, most had<br />\na snack and watched television<br />\nuntil just before their parents<br />\nwere due to arrive home.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that<br />\nalthough every kid was told to<br />\ncall mom, many were unable to<br />\nreach their mothers, due to the<br />\ntype of work they did. One<br />\nthird of all the kids interviewed<br />\ncould not reach their parents<br />\nwhile they were home alone.<br />\nIn every household, parents<br />\ngave a set of rules to be followed<br />\nwhen they were not home.<br />\nThese rules did not differ<br />\nsignificantly from one family to<br />\nanother, and were: 1) lock the<br />\ndoor behind you; 2) not to open<br />\nthe door for anyone; 3) not to<br />\nuse the stove; 4) not to tell<br />\nanyone on the phone that<br /><br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\nLynette Long, associate professor of education at the American University and author of the Handbook for Latchkey Kids and Their Parents.<br /><br />\nyou're home alone; 5) not to<br />\nhave friends over; 6) not to go<br />\noutside.<br />\nDespite the fact that these<br />\nrules were repeatedly drilled into the children's minds, according to Long, they were noi<br />\nalways upheld. In an Arizona<br />\nsurvey people went knocking<br />\non doors pretending to need a<br />\nglass of water or to use the<br />\ntelephone. Eighty percent of the<br />\nchildren tested let strangers in,<br />\nalthough they were told<br />\nspecifically not to.<br />\nAccording to Lonf, another<br />\nquestion that must be taken into consideration is whether or<br />\nnot latchkey kids are safe. It is<br />\na well known fact that kids<br />\nhave accidents. If a child is involved in an accident while at<br />\nhome alone, he must relate this<br />\nto his parents over the phone,<br />\nwho must then make an assessment as to the seriousness of<br />\nthe injury without seeing it.<br />\nOften a parent will not think an<br />\naccident is as serious as a child<br />\nmakes it appear and will pacify<br />\nthe child by saying that he will<br />\nlook at it when he gets home.<br />\nSometimes this response is<br />\nfine. Other times, if the accident is more serious than the<br />\nparent realizes, it is not.<br />\nAnother issue of major concern for parents is that of fire.<br />\nAccording to Long, although<br />\nalmost all kids are told not to<br />\nuse the stove, many do anyway.<br />\nIf a fire starts while a child is<br />\nhome alone, more often than<br />\nnot the child will try to put it<br />\nout or hide in a closet in the<br />\nhope that it will go away rather<br />\nthan calling his parents and<br />\nasking for help. Children are<br />\noften more afraid of their<br />\nparents' anger than of the fire.<br />\nIt is interesting.to note that a<br />\nsixth of all fires in the United<br />\nStates are started by kids who<br />\nare home alone.<br />\nLong is extremely interested<br />\nin the psychological effects on<br />\nchildren of going home to an<br />\nempty house. She did research<br />\non how kids felt about this. In<br />\ninterviewing children from first<br />\nthrough sixth grades, Long<br />\ndiscovered that every child interviewed was afriad at one<br /><br />\ntime or another, and that one<br />\nout of every three children was<br />\nafraid all the time. She gave examples of a third grade girl who<br />\nhid in a closet every day until<br />\nher mother came home from<br />\nwork, and of a sixth grade boy<br />\nwho checked all the windows,<br />\ndoors, and under the beds<br />\nbefore he settled down to watch<br />\ntelex ision while clenching a<br />\nbaseball bat.<br />\nTwo other psychological effects of being home alone are<br />\nboredom and loneliness. Long<br />\nstated, \"that kids are in a<br />\ntechnological prison.\" They are<br />\nsurrounded by TV's, VCR's,<br />\nAtari Games, etc., and are still<br />\nlonely. But they are lonely for<br />\nhuman affection and companionship. Children did not<br />\nknow what to do with all their<br />\nfree time and the responsibility<br />\nthey were given. As a result of<br />\nthis loneliness and boredom<br />\nmany latchkey kids become<br />\ndepressed.<br />\nLong is advancing three<br />\nmethods to help combat the<br />\npsychological effects of coming<br />\nhome to an empty house. One<br />\nidea is to get a pet for the child.<br />\nAll the kids interviewed asked<br />\nfor a dog. By the type of dog<br />\na child asks for, you can<br />\ndecipher what has affected<br />\nthem psychologically.<br />\nAccording to Long, if a child<br />\nasks for two, big, black dogs,<br />\nwho bite everyone, then most<br />\nlikely they are scared of being<br />\nhome alone.<br />\nThe second method being put<br />\ninto effect are hotlines for latchkey kids. These phone lines<br />\nresponds to both emergency or<br />\nroutine phone calls, and are<br />\noften manned 24 hours a day.<br />\nThe third program, which is in<br />\nthe planning stage, is something.<br />\ncalled \"After school care,\"<br />\nwhere children will be able to<br />\nstay at school until 6 p.m.<br />\nThere is controversy over who<br />\nshould pay for this program,<br />\nand as to who should administer it. An opinion being<br />\nconsidered is for the school to<br />\nlease the space to a private day<br />\ncare program for a reasonable<br />\nprice.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nScholarship Info<br />\nThe Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York<br />\nhas offered graduate scholarships for study at accredited<br />\nScottish universities to promote cultural interchange<br />\nand goodwill between<br />\nScotland and the United<br />\nStates since 1960.<br />\nStudents graduating from<br />\naccredited colleges or universities within the U.S. are eligible provided their permanent<br />\nhome addresses lie within the<br />\ngeographic boundries of<br />\nPennsylvania, New Jersey,<br />\nNew York, and the New<br />\nEngland States.

Once a bigot, she<br />\nbecame a proponent of the civil<br />\nrights movement.

Folks around here<br />\nusually plod along without much more<br />\nthan a nod to the outside world. But in<br />\nthe last couple of weeks even the racial<br />\nunrest of South Africa seems to have<br />\ntouched Homewood.<br />\nIt did so in the person of Pat Naidoo,<br />\na South African student activist who,<br />\nwhen forced to flee his own country or<br />\nbe thrown in jail, made his way here. A<br />\nmedical student in South Africa, Naidoo<br />\nhas apparently considered applying to<br />\nHopkins and completing his M.D. here<br />\n(he was only a few weeks from doing so in<br />\nSouth Africa when he was forced to go<br />\nunderground).<br />\nLed by Patrick Bond, a grad student<br />\nwho met Naidoo on a trip to South<br />\nAfrica in January, the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization passed a<br />\nresolution pledging support to Naidoo<br />\nand urging the university to give him<br />\n\"every possible consideration for<br />\nassistance.\" Apparently that means<br />\neither admitting Naidoo or offering him<br />\nsome sort of a research job while he goes<br />\nthrough the lengthy process of getting<br />\npolitical asylum.<br />\nBond then took his campaign to the<br />\nStudent Council. But still smarting from<br />\nits last jaunt into South African<br />\npolitics\u2014its endorsement of the class<br />\nboycott a couple weeks ago\u2014 the Council hemmed and hawed, and then decided to do nothing at all.<br />\nThe university's response to all this<br />\nisn't exactly clear. Norman Anderson,<br />\ndean of admissions at the medical<br /><br />\nschool, said Naidoo has been \"encouraged to clarify his visa status.\" That sort<br />\nof misses the point, of course, which is<br />\nthat Naidoo needs to know where he will<br />\nbe studying before he can \"clarify his<br />\nvisa status.\" It's true that Naidoo's supporters haven't really asked for anything<br />\nspecific (the GRO resolution quoted<br />\nabove, for example, is a remarkable<br />\ntestimonial to imprecision), but the<br />\nuniversity should\u2014for a couple of<br />\nreasons\u2014make an extra effort in<br />\nNaidoo's case.<br />\nFirst, Naidoo offers a chance for the<br />\nuniversity to make a not unimportant<br />\nstatement of opposition to apartheid by<br />\nembracing one of its victims. Bond's<br />\nrather strange argument that helping<br />\nNaidoo will in some way make up for<br />\n\"the years of profiting from its investments in apartheid\" is more than a<br />\nlittle unclear, but assisting those injured<br />\nby an evil system is clearly noble. Second, and in some ways more importantly, if the university is serious in what it<br />\nsays about wanting \"well-rounded\"<br />\nmedical students, Naidoo would seem<br />\nthe perfect applicant.<br />\nWe're hardly competent to make<br />\nmedical school admissions decisions, and<br />\nwe're certainly not arguing that academic<br />\nstandards should be lowered. Our point<br />\nis merely that the university should be<br />\nwilling to go the extra mile to assist<br />\nNaidoo. If admitting him to the medical<br />\nschool isn't feasible, then some sort of<br />\nresearch job or fellowship ought to be<br />\noffered. One way or another, Naidoo<br />\ndeserves some help.<br /><br />\nAre Hopkins Students Slobs?<br />\nMust Hopkins students be treated like<br />\ncomplete children? Apparently so. They<br />\ncan't seem to clean up after themselves.<br />\nTo be specific, student groups are back<br />\nto their old tricks: they're sticking up<br />\nposters everywhere. The campus is beginning to look so much like a garbage<br />\ndump, in fact, that the Student Council<br />\nfelt compelled to take up the matter<br />\nrecently at one of its meetings. Posters<br />\nare being plastered all over the place, said<br />\nStudent Activities Commission Chair'man Alan Rebenstock.<br />\nAs anyone who's been around a few<br />\nyears knows, the problem is hardly new.<br />\nIn fact, it was the sloppy look of the<br />\ncampus that prompted the SAC to adopt<br />\na new (and quite strict) poster policy last<br />\nyear. The problem was much worse then:<br />\nat election time candidates(or their supporters) would use hundreds of posters.<br />\nIn the finest monument to slovenliness,<br />\na few jerks would always put up several<br />\ndozen posters on the brick facade of the<br />\nsteps between the upper and lower<br />\nquads\u2014arranged in their name, or their<br />\ninitials, or the year of their class.<br />\nThat caused the SAC to adopt a new<br />\npolicy on postering, which essentially<br />\nallows only one poster per bulletin.<br />\nboard, and prohibits them elsewhere. It<br /><br />\nis this policy the Council is now seeking<br />\nto enforce more firmly.<br />\nThe worst thing about this, of course,<br />\nis that it's all patently silly. The Student<br />\nCouncil shouldn't have to waste its time<br />\non this. Neither, for that matter, should<br />\nthe SAC. Quite simply, students<br />\nshouldn't be such slobs that they have<br />\nto be told not to stick posters on doors<br />\nor windows or columns.<br />\nThe matter isn't a crucial one. It's not<br />\na tuition increase or an apartheid<br />\nboycott. The point is merely that there's<br />\nno reason to stick a thousand posters all<br />\nover the campus. Nobody wants the<br />\nplace to look like a pig sty, and surely<br />\nenough publicity is generated by posters<br />\non bulletin boards.<br />\nSo in the future, if you see a poster<br />\nstuck on a wall where it doesn't belong,<br />\ndo two things. First, rip it down. Second,<br />\ndon't go to the event. Maybe then groups<br />\nwill learn that making the campus more<br />\nugly is counter-productive.<br />\nAnd if you're in a student group or a<br />\nfrat or you help run one of the film<br />\nseries, don't be a slob. Maybe then the<br />\nCouncil and the SAC and everybody else<br />\ncan quit worrying about posters\u2014and<br />\nget on to important matters.<br /><br />\nDuring the first days of my<br />\nfreshman year I was brought to<br />\nlisten to the president of our<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nI remember him saying that<br />\nwe make the competition for<br />\nourselves, and that Hopkins<br />\ndoes not have to be the mill that<br />\nit is. He said that students<br />\nshould help each other and<br /><br />\nthe assistance of the administrative cadres, is taking<br />\naway from the students one<br />\nmeans by which to be released<br />\nfrom the daily academic ins and<br />\nouts. This is not just an isolated<br />\nexample. The ham radio shack<br />\nand last semester's Hutzler<br />\nreading room controversy are<br />\nother examples of the ad-<br /><br />\njoe chen<br />\nshould try to broaden their<br />\nacademic experiences beyond<br />\nour intended specialties.<br />\nI believed him for a while,<br />\nbut then I realized there were<br />\nglaring inconsistencies between<br />\nhis rhetoric and what Hopkins<br />\nis. I eventually realized that the<br />\nproblem was not the students'<br />\nfault. Rather, it was the administration itself which<br />\ncreated the problem and is<br />\nperpetuating it.<br />\nIt seems surprising that this<br />\nis the case, since the president<br />\nof the university has made such<br />\npublic pleas for the broadening<br />\nof students' interests, and has<br />\nheaded committees studying the<br />\nAmerican educational system<br />\nfrom various viewpoints. Yet,<br />\nunfortunately it is apparent that<br />\nthese words and acts ring<br />\nhollow.<br />\nA case in point is the impending doom of the studentmanaged radio station, WJHU.<br />\nAlthough perhaps too many<br />\nwords have been written on this<br />\nsubject, it perfectly illustrates<br />\nhere on<br />\nproblem<br />\nthe<br />\nHomewood.

The<br />\ndemonstration was a great success, if only as a result of the<br />\ninternational media coverage<br />\nwhich reported clear internal<br />\npolitical opposition.<br />\nBecause his calls for<br />\neconomic boycotts\u2014against<br />\nbusinesses,<br />\nwhite-owned<br />\nagainst U.S. companies doing<br />\nbusiness in South Africa, and<br />\nagainst the country itself\u2014are<br />\nconsidered treason, potentially<br />\npunishable by death (certainly<br />\na minimum of ten years in<br />\nprison), Naidoo was forced to<br />\ngo underground.<br />\nFrom that vantage point he<br />\nsaw the government manipulate<br />\nso-called Indians and Zulu<br />\ntribespeople into engaging in<br />\ncivil war.

We disagree.<br />\nCurrently, WJHU is managed and operated entirely by<br />\nstudents and other community<br />\nvolunteers. The station's officers and directors are elected<br />\nby station member from among<br />\nthemselves. Station members<br />\nare involved in musical programming, news production,<br />\nengineering, public affairs programming, sports coverage,<br />\npublicity and all other aspects<br />\nof running a radio station. Interested students and other<br />\ncommunity members are<br />\nalways welcome to participate.<br />\nMoreover, members can contribute as much or as little time<br />\nas they are able.<br />\nNorris feels that efforts to<br />\nensure the continued existence<br />\nof a student-run radio station<br />\nare very premature; that we are<br />\noperating under the mistaken<br />\nassumption that it will not be<br />\npossible for students to participate fully in the station.<br />\nNorris is correct about our<br />\nassumptions. The key word<br />\nhere is \"fully\"; we and Norris<br />\nseem to disagree on the meaning of full participation.<br />\nNorris feels that the three<br />\npart-time positions targeted<br /><br />\nCreagh pointed out that<br />\nwhether or not the announcers<br />\nare students is a matter of slim<br />\nconcern to the listener,<br />\nalthough it makes a great deal<br />\nof difference to the students.<br />\nWe agree entirely. We're a very<br />\nselfish group. We, the students,<br />\nwant WJHU all to ourselves. Is<br />\nthat attitude unreasonable?<br />\nCertainly not. That's what<br />\nWJHU is all about. Students.<br />\nIf we win awards for our performance along the way, that's<br />\nfine too. But when we're told<br />\nthat students can't or shouldn't<br />\nbe allowed to operate a radio<br />\nstation, we feel injured, and<br />\nrightly so.<br />\nWe agree with Creagh when<br />\nhe suggests that the university's<br />\nconcern was largely for the audience, as opposed to the staff<br />\nof the ten-watt audience. When<br />\nasked about the decision to turn<br />\nWJHU into a professional station, administration officials<br />\ninvariably mention the university's obligation to meet the<br />\nneeds of the expanded<br />\nBaltimore-Washington listening<br />\naudience the new WJHU will<br />\nhave. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity has no less of an<br />\nobligation to its students.<br />\nThe administration should<br />\nmake a determined effort to<br />\nallow true student radio to continue at Hopkins. We're not<br />\nlooking for jobs in the new<br /><br />\nWJHU. That sort of restricted<br />\nparticipation doesn't appeal to<br />\nus. There are just too many<br />\nstudents and community<br />\nmembers who invest a great<br />\ndeal of time and effort in the<br />\nis<br />\nWJHU. It<br />\ncurrent<br />\nreproachable for the university<br />\nto turn its back on us.<br />\nIt is quite clear that the<br />\nplans for the new WJHU have<br />\nbeen set. A professional<br />\nmanager has been hired, offcampus radio space has been<br />\nfound, and contracts have been<br />\nsigned. What hope is left for<br />\nthe students? Well, there is one<br />\nthing. The university can provide funding for the continued<br />\noperation of the student-run<br />\nstation on another frequency.<br />\nAccording to Norris, the<br />\ndecision to have a professionally managed station was not<br />\ndriven by consideration of the<br />\nexisting WJHU budget. In that<br />\ncase, why not let WJHU keep<br />\nits old budget? Besides, it is only fair that the university should<br />\nhelp WJHU in its effort to slide<br />\nalong the radio dial, considering the fact that it was WJHU<br />\nmembers who handled the entire 25,000 watt increase in the<br />\nfirst place. Of course, at the<br />\ntime, the members of the<br />\nmanaging board had no idea<br />\nthat the new station would be<br />\ncompletely professionally<br />\nmanaged. Why, had we known<br />\nthat, we would have been<br />\nperfectly happy to settle for only 100 watts.<br />\nIn any case, it is clear that<br />\nWJHU will become the National Public Radio Station of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nWhat remains to be seen is<br />\nwhether the university will show<br />\nthe same sort of commitment to<br />\nits students that it will toward<br />\nits listeners.

The poster<br />\npolicy does not restrict postering to certain bulletin boards,<br />\nbut restricts postering only to<br />\nbulletin boards, i.e. posters<br />\nmay not be put on doors, windows, and columns. Also, the<br />\npolicy does not require that<br />\ngroups remove their posters<br />\nafter the event. While this idea<br />\nmay be a worthwile addition to<br />\nthe current policy, at this time,<br />\na student is hired to clear the<br />\nbulletin boards of outdated<br />\nposters.<br />\nTherefore, for the edification<br />\nposterers<br />\nall<br />\nover<br />\nof<br />\nHomewood, the poster policy,<br />\nas published in the SAC Pro-<br /><br />\ncedures Manual, is as follows:<br />\n1. All posters must be placed on<br />\nbulletin boards only. Only one<br />\nposter per board per event is<br />\npermitted.<br />\n2. Each poster should have a<br />\nclearly marked expiration date.<br />\n3. Each poster must be affixed<br />\nwith thumbtacks or tape, not<br />\nstaples.<br />\n4. A fine of one dollar will be<br />\nassessed for each illegal poster,<br />\nthis includes both posters that<br />\nare not on bulletin boards and<br />\nexcessive postering on a bulletin<br />\nboard.

For<br />\n$9.95 not only do you get<br />\neverything you always wanted<br />\nto know about boomerangs but<br />\nwere afraid to ask, out your<br />\nvery own magical plastic orange<br />\nand blue returning boomerang.<br />\nWhat a bargain!<br />\nOnce you've spent a couple<br />\nof minutes reading about position, grip, aim, lift and launch<br />\nyou'll be ranging in no time.<br />\nOne thing the book insists on is<br />\nthat you follow the warning on<br />\nthe back cover, the inside front<br />\npage and somewhere else in the<br />\nbook which specifically states<br />\nthat you shouldn't throw a<br />\nboomerang without reading the<br />\nbasic safety rules. Some ot<br />\nthese so called rules are silly;<br /><br />\nlike \"wear sunglasses when<br />\nthrowing in bright condi\"be<br />\ntions.\"(no.7) and<br />\ncourteous at all times.\"(no.8)<br />\nTo whom, your boomerang or<br />\nthe guy you just hit and is ready<br />\nto feed you the boomerang?<br />\nBut read them anyway because<br />\nthey make sense and because I<br />\ndidn't and therefore paid.<br />\nBasic safety rule no. 1 states,<br />\n\"The playing field should be<br />\nlarge, flat, free of holes and<br />\nobstructions such as rocks and<br />\ntrees...beaches, parks...are unthrowing<br />\nsuitable<br />\nfor<br />\nboomerangs.\" On the beach, in<br />\nfront of MSE, I had to risk life<br />\nand limb retrieving a bright<br />\npiece of plastic from .a tree.<br />\nWorse yet a really nice girl borrowed a broom from the library<br />\nto help out, and was slightly insulted when someone asked if<br />\nshe was going to sweep or take<br />\na ride on it.<br />\nOK, after a little practice<br />\nyou've got down the minor<br />\nmiracle, \"it spins outward, tests<br />\nthe breeze, curves and climbs<br />\nand obediently comes winging<br />\nhome, whispering as it flies<br />\nclose and hovers softly down to<br />\nyour hands.\" So it does, mostly! But not only do you learn to<br />\nthrow and catch as the book's<br />\ntitle suggests but its hundred<br />\npages are also full of the<br /><br />\nhistory, the styles and forms,<br />\nthe competitions, and yes, the<br />\ntheory behind boomerangs.<br />\nSome of the myths about<br />\nboomerangs are dispelled.<br />\n\"Boomerangs were used by the<br />\naborigines to kill big game and<br />\nkangaroos.\" Not true. A<br />\nrelative of the boomerang, the<br />\nnonreturnable killing stick, was<br />\nthe device used for this purpose. So one asks what purpose<br />\ndid the boomerang serve in<br />\nAborigine culture? Well., it has<br />\nvarious functions from bird<br />\nhunting, to rituals, to making<br />\na fire.<br />\nStyles and forms are incredibly varied. From the<br />\nclassic two blader to the six<br />\nblader, which is a little difficult<br />\nto catch. Numerous pictures<br />\ndisplay the many different<br />\nkinds. One page covers the different carvings possible;<br />\ntomahawks, human shapes, letters, animals and other weird<br />\nshapes.<br />\nOne section deals with the<br />\nconstruction of your own<br />\nboomerang. For those inclined<br />\nto try, three different designs<br />\nare included. I haven't made<br />\nmy own yet, only because 1<br />\nhaven't bought the plywood<br />\nyet! You need a few basic tools<br />\nand several hours of work to<br />\ngain in return the satisfaction of<br /><br />\nJess Bunshaft<br /><br />\nThe author in the infamous tree in front of the MSE.<br /><br />\nhaving made something artistically beautiful with your<br />\nown two hands. You can follow<br />\nyour own designs and even<br />\nmake a night rang.<br />\nOnce you've acquired a little<br />\nskill, the last chapter contains<br />\ninformation on competitions,<br />\nstarting your own club, and<br />\nsome interesting games. You<br />\ncan learn how to throw two<br />\nboomerangs at the same time or<br />\nif you practice for a very, very,<br />\nlong time try the William Tell<br />\nstunt. The thrower launches the<br />\nboomerang and on the return it<br />\nslices an apple off his head. The<br /><br />\nbook even has a picture of this<br />\namazing stunt.<br />\nAs for me, I've fallen in love<br />\nwith the sport. I've bought<br />\nanother boomerang and a tube<br />\nof Ben-Gay for my sore<br />\nshoulders. If you're interested<br />\nyou can buy your own book at<br />\nthe Australia shop in the Innei<br />\nHarbor.

For the first<br />\ntime since the beginning of rock<br />\nand roll, the pop audience had<br />\nbegun to rise, take initiative,<br />\nand act as a recognizable force.<br />\nPop fans made themselves visible \"in the Harold Washington<br />\nand Jesse Jackson campaigns;<br />\nin insurgencies against tuxedo<br />\nleadership ir the trade unions;<br />\nin widespread ii diffuse<br />\nmovements againsf hunger,<br />\npolice brutality, and the danger<br />\nof war.\" Marsh states that the<br />\nreason for this was due to the<br />\nfact that a dramatically larger<br />\nportion of the pop audience<br />\nwas becoming painfully aware<br />\nof their economic hardships. A<br />\ngeneral recession had replaced<br />\nall traces of post-war prosperity present in the sixties and the<br />\nseventies. It was this change<br />\nthat supposedly prompted<br />\nMarsh and a few other writers<br />\nto begin in 1983 the Rock and<br />\nRoll Confidential, a newsletter<br />\nsensitive to the idea that the pop<br />\naudience had begun to become<br />\nactively concerned about social<br /><br />\nand political trends affecting contributions only in the sense brought up was why Madonna<br />\ntheir lives\u2014the mentality of ac- that they strengthened, clarified was so widely and ferociously<br />\ntion had begun to replace the and elaborated on black jazz attacked by some writers\u2014<br />\n\"experimental\" attitude of the and folk rhythms.<br />\n\"She has been called a slut by<br />\nprevious twenty years.

There are<br />\nalso some interesting articles on<br />\nhighly visible musical trends<br />\nsuch as punk, rap and heavy<br />\nmetal rock. Of course, these articles are all rather highly opinionated. For instance, the<br />\nwriter on heavy metal directly<br />\nstates that his favorite metal<br />\nbands of the eighties which he<br />\nalso believes have co-ntributed<br />\nmost to this category of rock<br />\nare 1)Van Haien, 2)Motorhead,<br />\nand 3)AC/DC.

However, the<br />\nwriters for these articles are for<br />\nthe most part thorough and<br />\nclear in their explanations of<br />\nwhat they believe in.

This discovery spawned<br />\na \"veritable explosion\" of further research into genetic<br />\ndisorders. The techniques of<br />\nseparating chromosomes for examination improved considerably over the years through<br />\nthe development of a method of<br />\n\"banding\" chromosomes (i.e.,<br />\nmaking visible specific markings or bands on individual<br />\nchromosomes), allowing the<br />\nGanesh Ramactianatan<br />\ngeneticist to distinguish betthe<br />\nand<br />\nGenetics<br />\n'Modern<br />\nlecture<br />\nDr. Victor McKusic giving a recent<br />\nween them; this technique was<br />\nHuman Condition.<br /><br />\nby Antara Mallampalli<br /><br />\ntalk was entitled \"Modern<br />\nGenetics and the Human Condition,\" and comprised an interesting and informative lecture and slide presentation dealmajor<br />\nthe<br />\nwith<br />\ning<br />\ndevelopments in medical<br />\ngenetics in recent years and<br />\nsome of the applications of<br />\nthese advances.<br />\nDr. McKusick explained at<br /><br />\nsubsequently refined to allow<br />\nhigher resolution and better picof<br />\ntures<br />\nindividual<br />\nchromosomes. Dr. McKusick<br />\nexplained that the \"bands,\" of<br />\nwhich there may be as many as<br />\nseven or eight hundred,<br />\ncharacterize the physical appearance of the chromosomes<br />\nbut are not themselves genes. In<br />\nfact it is estimated that there are<br />\nsome 50,000 to 100,000 genes<br />\non each chromosome, so the<br />\nbands themselves consist of<br />\nlarge numbers of genes.<br />\nDr. McKusick explained<br />\nthat, in general, genetic<br />\ndisorders can be classified into<br />\nthree categories. The first of<br />\nthese includes simple gene<br />\ndisorders following conventional Mendelian pedigree patterns; the second category consists of \"multifactorial<br />\ndisorders,\" relatively common<br />\nconditions like hypertension,<br />\nwhich seem to show no simple<br />\ninheritance patterns; and the<br />\nthird group is made up of gross<br />\nchromosomal aberrations involving complex malformations<br />\nof chromosomes. These three<br />\nsomewhat arbitrary categories<br />\ndeal with various types of germinal mutations(germ cells are<br />\ncells involved in reproduction,<br />\nas opposed to somatic cells,<br />\nwhich are not related to<br />\nreproducton).

It has<br />\nalso been theorized that the accumulation of somatic cell<br />\nmutations in non-reproducing<br />\ncells, such as cells of the nervous system, is one factor<br />\nresponsible for aging. In addition, Dr. McKusick noted that<br />\n\"some congenital malformations may be local somatic cell<br />\nmutations in developing cells.\"<br />\nTo illustrate the immense<br />\ngrowth in recent years of<br />\n\"genetic nosology\"\u2014the<br />\nclassification of separate types<br />\nof genetic disorders\u2014Dr.<br />\nMcKusick displayed a slide<br />\nshowing the steadily increasing<br />\nsize of the past six editions of<br />\nhis book, Mendelian Inheritance in Man, which he<br />\ndescribed as \"a catalog by locus<br />\nof all the human genes known<br />\nto man.\u2014 Dr. McKusick<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br /><br />\nIt's Time Again for The Great American Smokeout<br />\nby John Lafferty<br />\nThe American Cancer Society(ACS)is trying once again to<br />\nclear the air between smokers<br />\nand nonsmokers with its Great<br />\nAmerican Smokeout day on<br />\nThursday. November 21. It is<br />\non this day that many smokers<br />\nnationwide will start the habit<br />\nof breathing fresh air for a<br />\nwhole day. This of course, is a<br />\ngood habit\u2014one breath and<br />\nyou're hooked. In last year's<br />\nsmokeout, 37.7 percent of the<br />\nnation's females and 28.8 percent of male smokers paradd<br />\nwhich<br />\nticipated,<br />\nof<br />\nnumber<br />\nthe<br />\nto<br />\nsignificantly<br />\npeople who have quit smoking.<br />\nFrom 1978 to 1984, the ranks of<br />\nformer smokers increased from<br />\n31.5 million to more than 35<br />\nmillion. In fact, smoking on the<br />\nwhole is declining. Cigarette<br />\noutput was at 661 billion for<br />\n1983-1984, down 2.5 percent<br />\nfrom the year before. Consumption of cigarettes during<br />\nthe same period dropped about<br />\n3.5 percent. About 54 million<br />\nAmericans still smoke, and<br />\nsurveys show that 85 percent of<br />\nsmokers would like to quit and<br />\nabout 100 percent of<br />\nnonsmokers want the smokers<br />\nto quit. Many smokers have<br />\ntried to quit at least once. With<br />\nthese statistics in hand, the ACS<br />\nwill try even harder this year to<br />\nget across its message to stop<br />\nsmoking.<br />\nThe machine behind this<br />\ncampaign, the ACS, began in<br />\n1913. Back then, the word<br />\n\"cancer\" was rarely heard.<br />\nThere was little research done<br />\nand the disease was assumed to<br /><br />\nbe incurable. This, of course,<br />\nhas changed. The cancer survival rate is about 46 percent in<br />\nthe U.S., and with present<br />\nknowledge and treatments, it is<br />\ntheoretically possible to save<br />\nsome 55 percent of all patients,<br />\naccording to the ACS. It is<br />\nundeniable with its 2 million<br />\nAmerican volunteers and its<br />\nhuge research program, all<br />\nworking toward the elimination<br />\nof cancer entirely as a human<br />\ndisease.<br />\nThe 1982 Surgeon General's<br />\nReport stated that cigarette<br />\nsmoking is the major single<br />\ncause of cancer mortality in the<br />\nUnited States. Smoking causes<br />\nnot only lung cancer, but<br />\ncancers of the larynx, oral cavity, and esophagus. With all<br />\nthose cancers cause by any one<br />\nof the over 4000 isolated<br />\npoisons found in cigarettes,<br />\nwhy do smokers continue to<br />\nharm themselves as well as<br />\nthose around them? The reason<br />\nis that smokers are addicted to<br />\nthe nicotine found in processed tobacco products. The only<br />\nway that most smokers have<br />\nfound to break the habit is<br />\ncomplete cessation of smoking<br />\ncold turkey.<br />\nWhile cold turkey from<br />\ncigarettes has its clear<br />\nwithdrawal symptoms of irritability, anxiety, craving for<br />\ntobacco, and other symptoms,<br />\nNov. 21 need not be total<br />\nmisery for smokers. In fact, the<br />\nwhole idea behind the<br />\nSmokeout is to get nonsmokers<br />\ninto the act by helping smokers<br />\nto overcome the habit by hiding<br />\nashtrays, giving out all-day<br />\nsuckers, or even chocolate<br /><br />\ncigarettes. Many companies,<br />\nsuch as Bloomingdale's, Penzoil, General Electric, and<br />\nmany others have given out<br />\n\"Quit Survival Kits\" to their<br />\nemployees, and other incentives<br />\nto assist in the positive reinforcement of kicking the habit.<br />\nAt the Riverside Correctional<br /><br />\nFacility in Ionia, Michigan, 23<br />\npercent of the prison population attempted to \"trash their<br />\nash\" on Smokeout day. The<br />\n-hugging system,\" in which a<br />\nsmoker receives a hug from a<br />\nfriend instead of a cigarette, has<br />\nalso proved successful.

The<br />\nLady Jays, who head into the<br />\neastern regionals tomorrow<br />\nafternoon, compiled an exceptional 11-2 dual meet record.<br />\nOne of the two teams that<br />\nbeat the Jays, Franklin and<br />\nMarshall, raced in the MAC's.<br />\nStudly's<br />\nChuck<br />\nCoach<br />\nfavored<br />\nheavily<br />\nDiplomats were<br />\nto win the meet, and they proceeded to do just that. They<br />\nWon heavily with an amazing<br />\nscore of 23.<br />\nHopkins, Dickinson, and<br />\nGettysburg staged a close bat-<br /><br />\ntie for second but all three were<br />\nway behind F &amp; M. Dickinson<br />\nmanaged to take the silver as<br />\nthey barely edged the Jays by a<br />\n106-109 score. The Bullets came<br />\nin fourth with 115 points.<br />\nThings could have been different for Hopkins had senior<br />\nsensation Maureen Shea run a<br />\nbetter race. Shea has been the<br />\ntop runner for the harriers most<br />\nof the year, but all she could<br />\nmanage last Saturday on the<br />\nLebanon Valley College course<br />\nwas to place fourth on the Jays<br />\nand 28th overall.<br />\nInstead, Molly Bardsley led<br />\nthe Blue as she clocked a time<br />\nof 18:22 over the 2.95 mile trail.<br />\nIt was good for 14th place<br />\namong the 96 finishers. Cocaptain Cissy King was next for<br />\nHopkins as she took 17th at<br /><br />\n18:29. Her place counted as<br />\n16th when tabulating the teams'<br />\ntotals though because seven of<br />\nthe squads weren't complete so<br />\ntherefore the placement of the<br />\nrunners didn't count against the<br />\nother teams' scores.<br />\nAs for JHU's other runners,<br />\nSuzi McGinn came in 26th at<br />\n18:56 (her scoring place was<br />\n24th), Shea followed at 19:06<br />\n(25th) and then Anita Kim and<br />\nTami Oki. Kim edged Oki out,<br />\nbut each recorded a time of<br />\n19:14, good for 33rd and 34th<br />\nplaces, respectively. Kim's scoring place was 30th, while Oki's<br />\nwould have been 31st, but since<br />\nshe was the sixth Jay to finish,<br />\nher score did not count toward<br />\nthe Hopkins total.
