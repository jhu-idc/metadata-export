Gordon has also requested comments on his discipline proposal from the administrative heads of<br />\nthe other divisions of the University. They<br />\nhave all sent back recommendations, however, what effect these will have on his<br />\nfinal decision is not clear.<br />\nTheir report begins by defining con:<br />\nduct which might require discipline as<br />\nthat which \"abridges the right; of other<br />\nindividuals or groups, especially as it<br />\naffects the educational goals of those<br />\nwithin the University community, or<br />\nthreatens their safety, health or property,<br />\nor conduct that causes damage to physical facilities of the University.\"<br />\n\"Normal Functioning\"<br />\nThese categories are considerably<br />\nnarrower than those proposed by the<br />\n'President. Students would not be sanctioned for disrupting \"the normal functioning of the University\" as the committee found that phrase from Gordon's report to \"have no substantial and specific<br />\nmeaning and thus was liable to be applied<br />\nto any situation which some particular<br />\nsection of the University \"found offensive.\"<br />\nIn an appendix to its report, the<br />\ncommittee enumerated the reasons for<br />\nmost of the changes made. It was made<br />\nclear that the student-faculty group felt<br />\nthat various groups in the University<br />\nwould inteipret \"normal functioning\" differently.<br />\nMoreover, the Committee removes<br />\nGordon's proposal for sanctions against<br />\n- \"conduct that significantly impairs the<br />\neffective relationship of the University to<br />\nthe larger community of which it is part.\"<br />\nThe Committee felt that this area was<br />\ncovered \"in a way that was far less open<br />\nto misinterpretation...\"<br />\nFurther, the Committee states that<br />\n\"the University will not intrude itself into<br />\nthe personal lives of its students nor will<br />\nit add sanctions for unlawful behavior<br />\nalready dealt with by civil authority, unless such behavior falls within the class of<br />\n<br />\nconduct described above.\" This phrase<br />\nwas included in the original proposal of<br />\nGordon's original Discipline Committee.<br />\nReview Board<br />\nThe remainder of the report is concerned with setting up a Review Board<br />\nto consider any major punishments incurred by students. Punishments would<br />\nbe limited to suspension under the proposal, with no mention of expulsion,<br />\nwhich was included in Gordon's state. ment.<br />\nThe Review Board iS composed of<br />\ntwo undergraduate students, two graduate<br />\nstudents, two faculty members and one<br />\nadministrator. This adds two more students than Gordon's proposal. The members will be chosen by random selection.<br />\nThis board would conduct a trial of<br />\nany student sanctioned by suspension,<br />\nwith the power to sustain, increase or<br />\ndecrease the punishment or to exonerate<br />\nthe student.<br />\nEmergency Situations<br />\nThis section significantly differs from<br />\nGordon's recommendations on one point,<br />\nthe procedure in case of -an emergency.<br />\nUnder Gordon's proposal, if the administration felt that an emergency situation<br />\nexisted, it could apply immediate sanctions, with the Review Board considering<br />\nthe sanction after the fact.<br />\nThe new proposal has the Review<br />\nBoard convening \"by the next day\" in an<br />\nemergency situation, instead of the usual<br />\nrule of \"within five days.\"<br />\nBob Cotter, president of the Graduate Student Organization, and member of<br />\nthe Committee on Student Affairs, disagreed with the designation of any situation as an emergency one. He felt that<br />\nif the situation was not one .in which the<br />\npolice should be called in, then the normal procedures should be used. He felt<br />\nthat this emergency provision allowed the<br />\nadministration to avoid a confrontation.<br />\nHe said this does not offer \"any way of<br />\nexerting pressure by means of civil disobedience.\"<br />\nCotter also reported that the original<br />\nfinal draft of the committee's proposal<br />\nhad no administrators on the Review<br />\nBoard. It was only after a conversation<br />\nwith Gordon which the committee had,<br />\nthat one member changed his vote.<br />\n\" The reasoning tnat the committee<br />\nused at first to leave all administrators<br />\noff the committee, and later to limit their<br />\nmembcrship to one, was that since the<br />\nadministration was the prosecutor in these<br />\ncases, it should not have equal representation.

The letter of protest<br />\nsent by Freshman President David<br />\nCharry this week to Dean Swanson, was<br />\nrerouted to the Student Affairs Committee. It will be brought up at next Wednesday's meeting. If it is rejected, the<br />\nboycotters will have to face another semester of gym.<br />\nAlthough the freshmen maintain that<br />\nthere was no clear policy boycott and<br />\nno recruitment for the action, approximately 130 of them signed a \"complicity statement,\" indicating that they<br />\nwere not attending gym classes. Unofficial figures indicated that 140 students<br />\nfailed physical education for the first<br />\nsemester.<br />\n<br />\nWhite Vehement<br />\nAt the same time, Dr. John White,<br />\nChairman of the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs, vehemently denied that the boycott was responsible for the ultimate<br />\nsettlement of the issue. \"The action only<br />\nhurt the cause,\" he stated. \"The three<br />\nstudents who brought in the petition handled the situation correctly. We then reacted to them properly by having our<br />\n<br />\nAthletic Subcommittee look into the matter. That is what committees like Student Affairs are for.\"<br />\nA petition asking for an end to compulsory gym and a general upgrading of<br />\nthe physical education program was signed by 370 Freshmen and delivered to<br />\nDean Swanson's office on October 6.<br />\nSwanson officially forwarded the petition to the Student Affairs Committee<br />\non October 29, and from there it went<br />\nto the Permanent Subcommittee on Athletics.<br />\n<br />\n\"No Muddle\"<br />\n\"The power structure between committees is unclear,\" White admitted,<br />\n\"but there was no muddle about this.<br />\nSwanson wrote that his committee (the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate Studies)<br />\nwas not competent in the area of athletics, and we had a subcommittee that<br />\nwas. It's as simple as that.\" The Athletic<br />\nsubcommittee was set up in September as<br />\na \u2022 result of faculty complaints that the<br />\nphysical education program did not leave<br />\nthem enough time .slots for adequate use<br />\nof the gymnasium.<br />\nOn November 20, during a meeting with<br />\nDavid Charry, Jim Owens and various<br />\nother leaders of the movement, the subcommittee was informed of the boycott<br />\naction. Dr. Jackson Cope, chairman of<br />\nthe subcommittee, remarked that he was<br />\n\"surprised\" by the move, and thought<br />\nthat the signers were \"exerting undue<br />\npressure\" upon a committee which was<br />\nin the process of coming to a conclusion.<br />\n\"I told them I though that the second<br />\npetition made a strange bedfellow with<br />\n<br />\nthe original one, and that those who had<br />\nsigned both were being rather inconsistent,\" he explained.<br />\nMr. Charry maintains that the Freshmen resorted to staying away from gym<br />\nclasses because they were afraid that<br />\notherwise the subcommittee would take<br />\nits time on reaching a conclusion and<br />\nthat the question would remain unresolved into the second semester. \"It would<br />\nnever have been decided had there been<br />\nno pressure,\" he claimed.<br />\n\"Look,\" he continued, \"the subcommittee is heavily weighted toward the<br />\nPhysical Education Department.The boycott stopped the stalling. It wasn't aimed<br />\nagainst the committee--just against the<br />\nsubcommittee.\" Besides Cope, the subcommittee consists of Coach Alex Sotir,<br />\nDirector of Athletics Marshall Turner,<br />\ngraduate student Richard Barchi, and<br />\nundergraduates John Hammond and Paul<br />\nAllen.<br />\nDr. Cope disagreed with Mr. Charry's<br />\nanalysis. \"If you're asking whether the<br />\nsecond document (the boycott) had any<br />\neffect on either the committee or the subcommittee, the answer is `no'.\"<br />\n<br />\nPlan Rejected<br />\nOn December 10 the subcommittee's<br />\nfull plan for athletics, including one semester of compulsion, was released to<br />\nWhite's committee and promptly rejected. \"For me,\" White said, \"the (subcommittee's) advice didn't prove acceptable enough to demand compulsion.\"<br />\nThe committee then decided to abolish<br />\n<br />\nthe requirement, but not to make it retroactive to September, 1969. \"As far as<br />\nexplained,<br />\nconcerned,\"<br />\nWhite<br />\nI'm<br />\n\"everyone has a complete right to do<br />\nanything he wants to do through channels.<br />\nIf you ask someone to look at something<br />\nand you see that he is doing something,<br />\nthen you don't suddenly, right inthe middle, say we're not going to abide by the<br />\nrule as it now exists.\"<br />\n\"I don't believe in a physical education requirement for graduation. But it<br />\nbecomes continually more difficult to<br />\nmake rational decisions with a boycott<br />\ngoing on behind your back. The boycott<br />\nmade it much more difficult for all of<br />\nus.\"<br />\n<br />\nA Punishment?<br />\nCharry claims that the non-retroactive<br />\nclause in the recommendation is a punishment against the boycotters. \"There<br />\nis no question about it,\" he exclaimed.<br />\nWhite maintains that the action was<br />\n\"absolutely and categorically not\" a<br />\npunishment. \"The previous law exists<br />\nuntil the succeeding one takes over,\"<br />\nhe contended. \"The people who stuck<br />\nwith it have done it and those who haven't.<br />\nstill have it to do. Denying due process<br />\nmeans punishing those who went to gym.\"<br />\nIn Charry's view, this is \"circuitous\"<br />\nreasoning. \"The people who went to gym<br />\nare very thankful for what the others have<br />\ndone. I don't see how my going to gym<br />\nfirst semester could be construed a punishment. Go ask any of the Freshman.<br />\nYou'll see--none of them would feel punished if the boycotters were let off.

He defined \"substantial\"<br />\nas about 80%, or $2.4 million, of the loss.<br />\nThe 1969-70 budget exceeds $125 million,<br />\nincluding the Applied Physics Laboratory's $50 million budget.<br />\n<br />\nConscious Policy<br />\nThis was the second straight year that<br />\nHopkins has dipped into its capital reserves to break even. in 1968-69, the<br />\nUniversity ran $500,000 in the red. The<br />\nbudget has shown a $200,000 to $300,000<br />\nprofit in past years.<br />\nPresident Gordon claimed that the deficit in the past two years was a conscious policy of the Board of Trustees.<br />\n\"We decided we would rather run a temporary loss than cut back programs,\" he<br />\nremarked. However, due to expected increases and government research cuts,<br />\nthis year's budget will run $1 million<br />\nmore in the red than anticipated by the<br />\nTrustees last spring.<br />\nThe same policy will be in effect for<br />\nHopkins' finances in 1970-71. Kerley<br />\nstated that last Wednesday the Trustees Budget Committee decided to adopt<br />\n\"a conscious budgeting of the operating<br />\ndeficit by dipping into quasi-endowment<br />\nfunds.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"The coming budget is going to have to<br />\ngo up because of inflation,' he noted.<br />\nNevertheless, Dr. William Bevan, VicePresident and Provost, said, \"It will be<br />\nan exceedingly tight year. There's no<br />\nsecret about that.\"<br />\nDr. Gordon maintained that Hopkins<br />\nwas not alone in its financial plight. He<br />\ncalled the financial erosion of the country's private universities a \"serious<br />\nand nationwide problem.\"<br />\nThe President cited three major reasons why Hopkins is losing money: the<br />\ncutbacks in federal grants to universities, the rise in wages for nonprofessional workers and the inflationary spiral<br />\nthat has increased all expenditures.<br />\n<br />\nCutbacks and Increases<br />\nGovernment-financed research has<br />\nbeen on the decline for the last few years<br />\nat Hopkins. According to Bevan, this is<br />\nbecause Hopkins has ended much of its<br />\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) contracts,<br />\nand government officials have recently<br />\nbeen dissatisfied with basic research at<br />\nuniversities compared to applied reDOD conindustries.<br />\nsearch in<br />\ntracts have dropped as a percentage of<br />\nthe University's total research monies<br />\nfrom 18% to 8% in the past five years.<br />\nFoundations, led by the Ford Foundation, also have become discouraged with<br />\nprojects sponsored by the nation's<br />\nuniversities, said Dr. Bevan. He noted<br />\n<br />\nthat many local community action groups<br />\nare now being funded by foundations.<br />\nThe National Institute of Health and<br />\nNational Science Foundation fellowship<br />\ngrants have declined drastically.In 1967,<br />\nthere were 95 NIH fellowship awards.<br />\nThere may be none this year. There<br />\nhave also been major cuts in NSF grants<br />\nand contracts.<br />\nIn December Congress passed a bill<br />\nproviding $1 billion more for the Health,<br />\nEducation, and Welfare budget than President Nixon requested. The money, $134<br />\nmillion which would go to universities,<br />\nwas vetoed by President Nixon last week.<br />\n<br />\nUnless Congress overrules the President, Hopkins will be among the losers.<br />\nGordon estimated that if wage increases for Hopkins' nonprofessional<br />\nemployees follow the agreement reached<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins Hospital, it will cost<br />\nthe University $500,000 more than anticipated from January to June 1970,and<br />\n$1.5 million additional in the 1970-71<br />\nbudget.<br />\nFaculty salaries have been rising with<br />\ninflation at a rate of about 6-8% in past<br />\nyears, and the President expects the increases to continue.

The<br />\nresponse has been slower than expected. Some schools<br />\nhave responded to the announcements with wishes of<br />\nluck and congratulations, but a counselor at an all-girls<br />\nschool wrote back, \"shame, shame, shame.\"<br />\n<br />\n...Yes, Goucher<br />\n<br />\nRoger Faxon, member of the Coeducation Task Force, stated their report is being delayed past deadline.<br />\n<br />\narea.<br />\n<br />\n...Know<br />\nThe group feels that these two points are very important and must be resolved quickly so that the women<br />\nwho have been contacted will know exactly what they are<br />\ngetting into.<br />\nThe task force assigned to study coeducation is made<br />\nUp of six members.

At the start of this semester four<br />\nfull-time and six special female students have registered for classes as undergraduates.<br />\nMr. Brinkley said that the limit of 75 women for next<br />\nyear may be passed if there are more desirable applicants than that number. Although no definite plans have<br />\nbeen established for the entrance of women as freshmen,<br />\na few girls will be considered for fall, 1970, on the condition that they live at home and commute to Homewood.<br />\nThe Admissions Office has adopted a policy of rolling<br />\nacceptances for transfer students. As decisions are made<br />\non applications, notifications will be sent to students<br />\nImmediately, rather than all at once in the spring.<br />\nAt present, approximately 100 men have applied for<br />\ntransfer to Hopkins. This is about the same number as<br />\nhad sent in forms at this time last year.<br />\nNot as many applications have been received from<br />\nhigh school seniors as compared to the end of January.<br />\n1969.

He claimed that those applications that have<br />\nbeen received are excellent, and that there will be no<br />\nproblem in filling the class of 1974 with top-quality<br />\nstudents.<br />\nMr. Brinkley claimed that he has enjoyed his job much<br />\nmore since he has been interviewing girls for admission. He also indicated that his regret about the slow<br />\nresponse of women is more than just an interest in<br />\nHopkins' welfare.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nJan. 30, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Governance: Where It Stands Now<br />\nBy ANDY GREEN<br />\nStudents are still absent from major<br />\ndecision-making bodies at Homewood and<br />\nat the Medical School.<br />\nPossibility for change rests in both<br />\ncases with ad hoc committees set up to<br />\ndeal with the problem.

A<br />\nMaster Plan is in the making to relieve<br />\nthe present bottlenecks in the parking and<br />\nbuilding facilities on campus.<br />\nAccording to John McElwee,the Secretary of the Buildings and Grounds Committee for the Board of Trustees, four<br />\narchitectural firms are under consideration for the task of renovating Homewood<br />\narchitecture and constructing a parking<br />\ngarage on the Campus.<br />\nAdoption of the plan depends heavily on<br />\nthe passage of legislation currently pending in the State legislature. The bill calls<br />\nfor the creation of a state authority that<br />\nwill sell special revenue bonds to finance<br />\ncollege and hospital construction.<br />\nUnder the terms of the bill, several individual institutions can borrow money<br />\nfrom the Authority in one package loan.<br />\n<br />\nTax-exempt bond issues will then be sold<br />\nat low interest rates to \"anyone who<br />\nbids.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022'Lending Authority<br />\n<br />\nThe authority will lend money to colleges and hospitals for the retirment of<br />\noutstanding loans and mortgages carrying higher interest rates, as well as for<br />\nnew construction projects.<br />\nPresident Gordon proposed the Authority to Governor Marvin Mandel last<br />\nsummer. The Governor then had it prefiled, to be proposed to the General Assembly in the beginning of 1970. Because<br />\nit has the Governor's support, McElwee<br />\nis optimistic that it will pass the Legislature by summer.<br />\nIf so, he expects construction on the<br />\ngarage to begin by the end of this year.<br />\nIt should be completed by the end of<br />\n1971.<br />\n<br />\nThe garage will be located on the southwest side of the campus, in the Hopkinsowned portion of Wyman Park. Its cost<br />\nis predicted as $2.5 million.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Community Opposition<br />\nAlthough his committee will \"see how<br />\nbest to workwith the community,\" objection to the plan is expected from residents who wish to preserve the wooded<br />\narea.<br />\nThe garage will provide 11,000 spaces.<br />\nHowever, McElwee believes the \"parking situation is still going to be tight.\"<br />\nSome parking spaces that are available<br />\ntoday will be removed to make way for<br />\nconstruction on other parts of the campus he said, and additions to Schaffer<br />\nHall are expected to extend into the adjacent parking lot. The expected growth<br />\nof the University, including the need for<br />\nhousing facilities for women, will also<br />\ndetermine the number of parking spaces,<br />\nMcElwee added.<br />\nThe bond financing will also be utilized<br />\nto subsidize the construction of new<br />\nbuildings.

The Baltimore Gas and Electric Company had previously cut off the<br />\nPanthers' utilities after they failed to<br />\npay $600 in bills. The company restored<br />\nservice after the Committee payed about<br />\n<br />\none quarter of the Panthers' total bill<br />\naccording to Jim Archibald, Student Association President.<br />\nThe Committee now plans to concentrate on the police harassment of the<br />\nlocal Panthers. Dr. Wickwire stated that<br />\nhe has been in contact with Governor<br />\nMandel's office, and that a meeting to discuss the problem should take place<br />\nbefore February 15.<br />\nIn regard to police persecution, John<br />\nClarke, one of the Panther's present at<br />\nthe meeting, alleged that the Baltimore<br />\npolice have the party headquarters under<br />\nconstant surveillance from a stake-out<br />\nin a gas station opposite the Panthers'<br />\nbuilding. Clark emphasized that police<br />\nharassment extends not only to the Panthers but to the entire black community.<br />\nAccording to Clark the police \"occupy<br />\nour community like troops\" and \"are<br />\n<br />\nthere to watch, harass and murder us.\"<br />\nGhetto Drugs<br />\nIn addition to harassment of blacks,<br />\nClark charged that the police were doing<br />\nnothing to halt the growth of drug addiction in the ghetto. Police action against<br />\nnarcotics traffic is always directed<br />\nagainst the ghetto resident who uses or<br />\npushes drugs, but never against the outsider who distributes them on a large<br />\nscale as part of organized crime. The<br />\npower structure, Clark alleged, is ready<br />\nto allow drug addiction to reach the same<br />\nepidemic proportions which alcoholism<br />\nreached among American Indians.<br />\nThe Panthers also discussed their<br />\nefforts to provide services to the neglected members of the black community<br />\nthrough a free medical clinic and a breakfast program for school children. Currently the Panthers are attempting to<br />\n<br />\nraise money to purchase a building to<br />\nhouse the clinic at 14 Carey Street. The<br />\nclinic would dispense basic medical services and advice to the local community.<br />\nNurses at Hopkins Hospital have volunteered to staff the clinic.<br />\nThe breakfast program currently is<br />\nserving between twenty and forty children<br />\na day. Clark said that the low participation was due to bad weather and that<br />\nin the spring as many as three hundred<br />\nchildren participate in the program.<br />\nDr. Vernon Dobson, President of the<br />\nBaltimore Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance and a member of the Political Freedom Committee, concurred<br />\nwith the Panthers' assertions of oppression of the black community by governmental authorities and declared that the<br />\nproblem of urban survival for blacks was<br />\na national one.<br />\n<br />\nWorker Pay Hike Under Consideration<br />\npay and benefits the way the Hospital<br />\nemployees are being treated.\"<br />\n<br />\nWith or without a union, Hopkins<br />\nemployees may be in for a substantial<br />\npay raise - - or so says the University's<br />\nbudget. A final decision is expected<br />\nearly next week.<br />\nIf current plans hold, the money -$900,000 is the figure most talked about<br />\nby administrators -- is slated to come<br />\nfrom the University's quasi-endowment<br />\nfunds. Projected pay raises will account<br />\nfor about one-third of Hopkins' $3 million budget deficit for fiscal year 197071.<br />\nIn commenting on the proposed pay<br />\nhike, Robert Kerley, Vice President for<br />\nAdministration, pointed to the Univversity's \"policy of trying to stay competitive,\" adding that, \"we are obligated<br />\nto treat our own employees in terms of<br />\n<br />\nAgreed to 'Not Object'<br />\nBoth Locals 1231 and 1199E, the two<br />\nunions competing to organize Hopkins<br />\nnon-professional<br />\nemployees,<br />\nhave<br />\nagreed to \"not object\" to the proposed<br />\npay hike, and not use it as grounds for<br />\nunfair labor practice charges against<br />\nthe University.<br />\nA union representation election scheduled for last December 5, was indefinitely postponed 48 hours before the polls<br />\nwere to open, when lawyers for 1199E<br />\nwent to court to protest their exclusion<br />\nfrom the ballot.<br />\nAt the time, Federal District Court<br />\nJudge Dorsey Watkins barred an election until the University and Local 1231,<br />\n<br />\nMONUMENTAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY<br />\nannounces<br />\n<br />\nSCHOLASTIC AWARDS<br />\nIN ACTUARIAL MATHEMATICS<br />\n$750 each<br />\nIf you are a Johns Hopkins undergraduate in the Class of'71,<br />\n'72 or '73 and a Maryland resident, you are eligible to compete for the awards, which will be granted on the basis of<br />\nexaminations of the Society of Actuaries to be held in Baltimore in May 1970.

He noted, however,<br />\nthat the presentation and transfer of<br />\nknowledge has nothing to do with the student's personal growth and intellectual<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nenrichment. \"As teachers, we're have to<br />\ntry to provoke the creative self-expression of each individual student. People<br />\nwho teach painting, music and drama<br />\nhave known this for a long time,\" he explained.<br />\n<br />\nTo Grade Or<br />\nProctor plans to re-examine the gr2ding system. \"You have to get the students<br />\nto be himself, not what societywants him<br />\nto be. If the student gets too hung up on<br />\ngrades and on turning out the kind of<br />\nthinking and writing he thinks the professor expects,then he's not really growing as an individual; he's not exploring his<br />\nown thoughts, feelings and ideas.\"<br />\nThere will be five to six graduate instructors involved in \"Paradox and Revolution.\" Each instructor will handle<br />\nthat part of the course which concerns<br />\nhis own special field of study.

Rumblings of dissatisfaction over Homewood's antiquated and clumsy decision-making processes emanated from many segments<br />\nof the community.<br />\nDr. George Owen proposed last September a University Senate which<br />\nwould represent students, faculty and administrators. At the time, we<br />\nsupported the plan, and the Student Council and the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization both sent letters to Dr. Gordon, advocating the creation of a<br />\nUniversity Senate. Dr. Owen's plan was submitted to the Academic<br />\nCouncil and has been sat on for four months. The Academic Council's<br />\ncommittee-to-appoint-the-committee-gambit effectively forstalled any significant action to this point. The Student Council has held grandiose<br />\n\"tactics sessions,\" created a committee and reassured its constituents of<br />\nits \"firm stance.\" The Graduate Student Organization has issued similar<br />\nstatements and done equally little.<br />\nIn short, students seem content to \"let the matter go through channels,\" and it seems not to matter that the channels are clogged with the<br />\nsewage of \"professorial courtesy,\" face-saving and misleading verbiage. It<br />\nis time students realized that nothing is being done about governance, and<br />\nthat nothing will be done this year if the Academic Council is allowed to<br />\nproceed at its own pace. It is not to the advantage of the faculty to<br />\nchange the system of governance at Homewood. As it stands, faculty<br />\nwishes are unhindered by annoying student demands. It is unrealistic to<br />\nsuppose that the faculty will act with all possible speed to deprive itself<br />\nof its privileged status.<br />\nLast year, students at Homewood demonstrated that they could<br />\nforce the system to respond to legitimate demands. It seemed to the<br />\nAcademic Council and the administration that calendar reform could not<br />\npossibly be enacted in time for the fall term of the present school year.<br />\nA militant stance by students quickly convinced the policy makers that<br />\ncalendar reform was not only feasible but necessary.<br />\nThis week, Dr. Woodford Howard stated that the March deadline<br />\nfor his committee's report is \"unrealistic.\" However, if the March deadline is not met, governance reform will not be possible by next year.<br />\nDr. Howard's committee is charged with determining whether \"widespread dissatisfaction\" over governance exists. Presumably they will take<br />\ninto account whether dissatisfaction exists among the students. It is indicative of the faculty's attitude toward' the S.C. and G.S.O. that it did not<br />\ninterpret their letters as showing student dissatisfaction.<br />\nThe faculty may believe that if student opinion were united in dissatisfaction with governance, much more would have been heard from<br />\nstudent representatives. Certainly, these representatives should do more<br />\nthan send one letter affirming their \"firm stance.\" As a first step, they<br />\nmight poll those they represent to see if the dissatisfaction exists. If it<br />\ndoes, they should be prepared to exert as much pressure as possible to see<br />\nthat governance is not let slide another year.<br />\n,<br />\nIMMO<br />\n<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\n<br />\nRichard B.

It was, most agreed, an impressive speech which served to both<br />\nset admiral goals for the next decade<br />\nand at the same time steal central issues<br />\nfrom<br />\nthe democrats in Congress.<br />\nAnalysis of the speech reveals much the<br />\nsame impression that one gets from the<br />\nentire Nixon performance to date: a lot<br />\nof cheap talk.<br />\nThe President, after again implying<br />\nthat patriotism is synonymous with support of his questionable peace \"plan,\"<br />\ntalked at great length about the issues of<br />\ncrime and the quality of the environment. In meeting these two challenges,<br />\nthe President said, there can be no rigid<br />\npartisanship.<br />\nWhen he came to the first issue of<br />\ncrime in the streets, Mr.Nixon immediately blamed the democratically controlled Congress for holding up his crime<br />\nmeasures. The President did admit,<br />\nperhaps for the first time, that crime is<br />\nbasically a local problem. However, the<br />\nFederal government's anti-crime budget<br />\nwill double in the next fiscal year.<br />\nAbsent from the message was any mention of crimes of a different sort: the<br />\ndeprivation of voting rights in the South<br />\nor lethargy in enforcing Supreme Court<br />\ndesegregation orders.<br />\nIgnoring Complications<br />\nWhile the President spoke of the way<br />\nin which organized crime and pornography make society sick, he failed to<br />\nmention other sickness, such as inadequate housing, food and education. To<br />\nthe contrary, he this week vetoed the<br />\n<br />\nOlander<br />\n<br />\n.t.E.W. appropriations bill, which, he<br />\nsaid, contains too much money for education.<br />\nSo on crime, the President is mostly<br />\ntalking to his precious \"Silent Majority.\"<br />\nThis group, the President correctly believes, is more concerned with the symptoms than the causes of crime.<br />\nWhen the President spoke about polution and the destruction of the environment, he again spoke to the \"Silent<br />\nMajority.\" For clean air is not of concern<br />\nto the hungry; clean waters are of little<br />\nvalue to the many that never leave a<br />\nparticular urban neighborhood. This is<br />\nnot meant as criticism of the very commendable job the President did of committing himself to the cause of nature.<br />\nThe trouble is that Mr. Nixon believes<br />\nthat spending money for one domestic<br />\nprogram is a dramatic reordering of<br />\npriorities. Also the President is not<br />\nignorant of the fact that polution is one<br />\nof the most politically valuable causes<br />\ntoday.<br />\nNon-Partisan Purge<br />\nMatching the Nixon rhetoric to the Nixon action is an interesting exercise.<br />\nRemembering the self-professed abdication of rigid partisanship made by the<br />\nPresident on behalf of this issue, it is<br />\ninteresting to note that H.E.W. is currently removing every picture and quotation belonging to Senator Muskie from<br />\nall government literature on the subject<br />\nof polution. Though Mr. Muskie has long<br />\nbeen the senate authority on improving<br />\nthe environment, he suffers the misfortune of being a democrat.<br />\nContinued on p. 12<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE ii<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nJan. 30, 1970<br />\n<br />\nJulius rs.

After I identified myself as a<br />\nfriend of Mr. Kunstler's, a rather pale young girl donned<br />\na trenchcoat and<br />\nvolunteered to lead me to the courthouse a block away. The office itself is full of posters<br />\nand People, and one cannot escape the feeling that some<br />\nkiu'd of<br />\ncircus is going on, without a ringmaster.<br />\nUpon arriving at the Federal building, a sterile, spanking-new twenty-seven story glass and steel monolith, you<br />\nare greeted by Federal Marshalswho scan a list of names<br />\nt\u00b0 see whether you are on it or not. I wasn't. After some<br />\ntalking, the girl and I managed to persuade one of them to<br />\naccompany us to the twenty-third story,where the trial is<br />\nactually<br />\ntaking place.<br />\nComposed of several court rooms and smaller offices,<br />\nthe floor is crowded with young people. At the end of the<br />\nall, a group of marshals clustered around a barricade.<br />\nThis barricade ,<br />\nI soon learned,was the entrance<br />\nto the Courtroom. My escort propelled me towards a threesome, and I suddenly knew which one Kuntsler was. His<br />\nhair was fairly long, and his suit was rumpled, but he<br />\nexuded forecefulness. As I was about to introduce myself,<br />\na Young Black couple passed inthe hall, and in recognition<br />\nlie gave them the Black Panther clenched fist salute.<br />\n<br />\ninterest perks up considerably upon his entry. No more<br />\nsomnambulent jurors. Asked his profession, he replies,<br />\n\"poet and chanter.\" He is then askedwhere he studied the<br />\naforementioned chanting. The question elicits a long,<br />\nrambling reply which uses dozens of Buddhist names,all of<br />\nwhich the middle-aged stenographer dutifully struggles<br />\nwith.<br />\n<br />\nThe polemics begin, and the belligerent government<br />\nattorney initiates a steady stream of objections. The judge,<br />\nwith near monotouous regularity, sustains them. On the<br />\nstand is Phil Ochs, well-known singer, who keeps annoying the earnest young man prosecuting the government's<br />\ncase by continually elaborating the answers to the questions posed him by Kuntsler. The attorney finally objects,<br />\n<br />\n\"Oh, no, I've taken you to task, but never<br />\ngotten angry.\"<br />\n<br />\nand Mr. Magoo admonishes the witness to pay closer attention to the questions asked, whereupon Kunstler interjects, \"Your honor, many of our witnesses are unused to<br />\ntestifying.\" (to Ochs) \"You're learning the hard way.\"<br />\nHoffman interrupts, \"And the proper way.\"<br />\nKunstler: \"Your Honor, that was a good one.\"(laughter)<br />\nHoffman? \"I just didn'twant you to thinking that I treat<br />\nwitnesses in this case any different from those in any<br />\n<br />\nother.\"<br />\nKunstler: \"I was complimenting your Honor.\"(laughter)<br />\nHoffman: \"I have my doubts about that, but I'll let it go.\"<br />\n(laughter)<br />\nOchs' testimony continues, and he once more begins<br />\nelaborating on the questions asked him. The prosecutor<br />\nstarts a vigorous objection, and the judge once again<br />\nadmonishes Ochs to pay closer attention to the questions<br />\nposed him, beginning his admonition with, \"Young man,<br />\nyou're a singer, but you're smart.\"<br />\nThe testimony has been centering on Ochs' relation-<br />\n<br />\nAfter a certain period of time, the government finally<br />\nobjects, saying that the jury has a good enough idea of the<br />\nwitness's qualifications. Hoffman, after ruling, comments<br />\nsomewhat wryly, \"I have a vague idea of the witness's<br />\nprofession. Its vague, but I have an idea. I know he said<br />\nhe was a poet. The rest I don't know about.\" (laughter).<br />\n<br />\nThe Mantra<br />\nThe defense further develops the theme of Ginsberg's<br />\nrelationship with the defendants Rubin and Hoffman.He is<br />\nasked about a February '68 press conference that he held<br />\nwith Rubin and Hoffman in New York. He replies that he<br />\nrecited a mantra, or Indian Chant, and launches into it<br />\nforthwith. The judge fumes while the spectators and even<br />\nthe government attorneys clutch at their sides in order to<br />\ncontrol their laughter. Hoffman states that the mantra is<br />\ninadmissable as part of the testimony because \"the language of the Federal Court of Northern Illinois is English.\"<br />\n(laughter)<br />\nKunstler replies that Latin has been admitted in U. S.<br />\nCourts. Hoffman replies that there is no translator,\"unless perhaps one of the ladies or gentlemenof the jury is<br />\nfamiliar with Sanskrit.\" He then smiles and admits that<br />\n\"Sanskrit is one I don't know.\"<br />\nDefense then introduces a red, box-like object, and asks<br />\nGinsberg to identify it, it being a harmonium.In response.<br />\nGinsberg plays a tune, and once more everybody begins to<br />\nsnicker. The Government objects, and Hoffman sustains<br />\nthe objection, declaring that \"the witness has been asked to<br />\nidentify it, and instead he has played us a tune.\" This is<br />\nthe last great bit of wisdom that is dispensed that afternoon, for with the coming of five o'clock the judge adjourns<br />\nthe court until ten o'clock the following morning.<br />\n<br />\nre a singer but you're smart.\"<br />\noung man, you'<br />\n<br />\ny<br />\n<br />\nThe Courtroom<br />\nThe room is panelled in rich squares of wood, and has<br />\ntrriodernistic wood benches that are apparently supposed<br />\nt\u00b0 he form -fitting. Over Judge Hoffman's seat hang pictires of Franklin, Jefferson, Washington, and others. Half<br />\n\u00b0I the room is cut off for the press, forcing the predominantlY young spectators to crowd into the back. Further<br />\n81:leculation about the aesthetic niceties of the United Stales District Court for the Northern District of Illinois is<br />\ncu<br />\nrtailed by the entrance of a dolly carrying some of the<br />\nProsecution's material, some of which conveniently falls<br />\n\u00b0n the floor just as Abbie Hoffman, complete with Indian<br />\nheadband and multi-colored shirt, strolls in. Hoffman<br />\nstet:Ts to pick up some of the papers, and immediately<br />\ncries ring<br />\nout of \"don't touch it.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Defendants<br />\nHoffman grins, straightens up, and walks forwardwhile<br />\ns\u00b0Inebody shouts, \"Hoffman will do anything to zap the<br />\nPvernment's case.\" The other defendents begin to come<br />\n!n\u2022 They seem an oddly-mixed group; Dellinger,the greying pacifist, Hoffman,the radical, Hayden,self-proclaimed revolutionary, and the others.<br />\nThe jury enters, and then the judge. Of the fourteen<br />\njbliirc'rs, twelve are women, and three of those twelve are<br />\nl'ack. The Court is asked to rise, and in comes Hoffman,<br />\n\"king for all the world like Mr. Magoo, except that he<br />\ne\u00b04tinually wears the expression of a man much misunderstood.<br />\n<br />\n11 1OA5 WOW FOR<br />\nOS TO SET (K)TO<br />\nV611\\KA-<br />\n<br />\n6UT I2CMONSTRATIW<br />\nAGAINSTTIC C;OVVIRN NWT IS uk)PATRIOTIC.<br />\n<br />\nship with the defendants Hoffman and Rubin. Asked about<br />\na pre -convention rally, Ochs states, \"the crowd shouted<br />\nfuck L.B.J., and so did I.\" A victory sign is flashed to<br />\nOchs by Dellinger, who grins broadly. The jury seems<br />\nless attentive than the spectators, with one of the women<br />\ndozing. They are soon awakened however, upon the government's cross-examination of Ochs. The young lawyer<br />\naccuses Ochs of backing off under cross-examination from<br />\nprevious statements. He even calls the witness's testimony \"patent.\" Kunstler throws his legal tablet down on<br />\nthe floor in rage, shouting, \"your honor, I object.\"<br />\nHoffman: \"Sir, I will not permit you to address me in<br />\nthis tone. Let the record show that Mr. Kunstler threw his<br />\npapers to the floor.\"<br />\nKunstler: \"Your Honor, I got angry for a moment.

Ochs is asked what songs he sang during convention week. His guitar is presented to him and he is asked<br />\nif this is indeed the guitar upon which he played those<br />\nsongs. He assents. The defense asks that he be allowed<br />\nto sing some of those songs, whereupon the government<br />\nobjects, claiming that \"the defense is trying to turn this<br />\ntrial into a circus.\" Hoffman sustains the objection, and<br />\nlater, as Ochs steps down,the judge admonishes him not to<br />\nforget his guitar.<br />\nThe next witness for the defense is Allen Ginsberg, and<br />\n<br />\nt'OT LJEV 1.056 FACE<br />\nF L GOT OUT-<br />\n<br />\nsuppoRT -0-16<br />\nPRESIDela.<br />\n<br />\nVNI FOR 9AVI1J6<br />\nAHERICAK) LIVES-<br />\n<br />\nE3UT t 14511 (-1C0<br />\nCHAM66 H15 POI.ICIE5<br />\n<br />\nKunstler & Co.adjourn to an adjacent room ,where Ginsberg, Ochs, and the defendants talk.

As we leave the building, the<br />\nsequestered jury is driven by in a yellow school bus. Several of them wave to Kunstler, and he, grinning, turns to<br />\nme and says, \"did you see that?\" For the first time that<br />\nafternoon, I began to feel that the defense might have a<br />\nchance.<br />\n<br />\nThehael<br />\n<br />\nOUT TAUNG ABOUT<br />\nIT ONW RCI,PS<br />\nHMO(.<br />\n<br />\nfl ft0 9NPATV 1A)111{ 1/{6<br />\nAIUMEOT5 OF TfiC FRO-TETER5.<br />\n<br />\n-rce ME L3ERRE<br />\nf KIW.

In the violence of our<br />\nactions, in the destruction we have<br />\ncaused, many of us have seen our country for the first time.<br />\nThe New York Times<br />\nis shocked by<br />\nthe slaughter at Song My: \"Reports of<br />\nthe deliberate, methodical killing of<br />\nhundreds of civilians - men, women and<br />\nchildren - by American troops in a Vietnamese village last year are so shocking, so contrary to the principles for<br />\nwhich this country has stood, as to be<br />\nbeyond belief,\" Where has the Times<br />\nbeen? Song My is no more isolated an<br />\nIncident than our treatment of black<br />\npeople, than Chicago, than two assassinations, than our condemning totalitarianism and supporting Thieu, Franco,<br />\nthe Greek junta and other bastions of<br />\ndemocracy in the free world. I am not<br />\nsaying that America is evil, only that<br />\nthe myth it believed of itself is being<br />\ntorn apart.<br />\nWe are just like everyone else now--in<br />\nsome ways very good, in other ways<br />\ncrass and sordid. \"The land of the free<br />\nand home of the brave\"; \"with liberty<br />\nand justice for all\"; dying so that others<br />\nwill be free--it all sounds strange now,<br />\nlike some \"asthmatic whisper\" from a<br />\nvague dream. The old words, the vision<br />\nof ourselves as a chosen people, are<br />\ndead. The vision died at Song My, at<br />\nHamburger Hill, at the town we destroyed<br />\n<br />\nto save, with the use of chemical warfare, and with the uprooting of four and<br />\na half million people in the country we<br />\nare protecting.<br />\n<br />\nWe Were As Gods<br />\nThose who still believe in the omnipotency and the God-like quality of<br />\nAmerica have their voice in the White<br />\nHouse. The more they cling to their<br />\n<br />\n\"silent majority\" to show the world that<br />\nAmerica is really behind the president<br />\non the war? It is possible that the administration knows exactly what it wants<br />\nand is using whatever it can to provoke<br />\nthe response they desire. It is also possible that they believe almost everything<br />\nthey say and are incapable of seeing the<br />\ncontradictions. What lies behind both is<br />\nthis cursed myth of America,an America<br />\n<br />\nbeliefs, the more darkness we spread.<br />\nDoes Nixon really believe the capsule<br />\nhistory he gave the country on November<br />\n3 on how we got into the war? Does<br />\nAgnew have any idea when he quotes<br />\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison just who the man<br />\nhe was quoting was? What does the administration think when they advertise<br />\nfree speech and then do everything they<br />\ncan to silence those who disagree with<br />\nthem, including making a film on the<br />\n<br />\nContinued on p. 14<br />\n<br />\nNixon Makes Mass Effort; Well, Not Really<br />\nContinued from p. 10<br />\nSpecifically, the President proposed a<br />\nten billion dollar, five year program<br />\nfor adequate water treatment facilities.<br />\nHe created the impression that this is<br />\na massive effort. A close look at the<br />\nproposal reveals its modesty. Under the<br />\nplan, the government would<br />\nNixon<br />\nactually only pay about four billion dollars in ten years. The rest would be<br />\nfinanced by local bonds. Even though<br />\nmost local governments are bonded up<br />\nto their financial necks. The Federal<br />\ncontribution proposed by the President is<br />\napproximately 250 million per year less<br />\nthan what is already appropriated for<br />\nwater pollution alone. Furthermore, the<br />\nPresident refused to spend several millions of this allocation in the last year.<br />\nMr. Nixon's policy is actually a step<br />\nbackward.<br />\n<br />\nThe inadequacies inherent in the<br />\nPresident's position appear even greater<br />\nupon close examination. As Hubert<br />\nHumphrey pointed out tliis week, the<br />\nPresident can suggest all the water<br />\ntreatment he likes without removing the<br />\ncause of the pollution: industrial waste.<br />\nAnd the only way that industry is going<br />\nto stop dumping untreated garbage into<br />\nthe water supplies is through vigorous<br />\ngovernment regulation of its disposal<br />\nprocedures. Will the President, a highly<br />\npartisan Republican, even suggest such<br />\nregulations? Or are the limitations of<br />\nhis political philosophy sufficient to rule<br />\nout a real solution? As James Reston<br />\nhas noted, after zig-zagging to the left<br />\nand right trying to please everyone, the<br />\nPresident will eventually have to go left<br />\non this issue if he is to live up to the<br />\n<br />\ntalk.<br />\nThe quality of the environment often<br />\nis concerned with the urban environment.<br />\nOne of the largest causes of urban pollution is the automobile. Will Mr. Nixon<br />\nstress rapid transit in the cities to cut<br />\ndown the choking traffic or favor more<br />\nand better highways to carry the \"Silent \u2022<br />\nMajority\" to work every morning?<br />\n<br />\nTreats Symptoms, Sewage<br />\nThe most laudable and also expected<br />\nthing the President said in his message<br />\nwas that having money is not the same<br />\nthing as having happiness and that future<br />\ngrowth must be redirected toward qualitative improvement.

The varsity swam three meets,<br />\nagainst P.M.C., University of Delaware, and<br />\nDrexel. They took two and dropped the one to<br />\nin a close meet. The frosh swimmers<br />\neat the Gettysburg College frosh and<br />\nbeat<br />\nlost to the<br />\nDelaware<br />\nfreshman.<br />\nThe Delaware meet was closer than the score<br />\nof 72 to 41 would seem. Hopkins beat them for the<br />\nfirst time last year with a larger team.This year<br />\nMost the individual swimmers were better, but the<br />\nteam had less depth and Delaware had more.JHU<br />\nlost the first event, the 400 medley relay, by only<br />\na tenth of<br />\na second. They came back to win the<br />\nsecond, the 1000 yard free style, with Marc Solomon taking first and Doc Hersberger securing a<br />\nneeded third.<br />\nAnother good race for Hopkins was the 200 butterfly. Marc Solomon and Gene Bonte came in first<br />\nand second,leaving the closest Delaware swimmer<br />\nfive seconds behind in third.Sophomore,Jim Scott,<br />\nswam a 2.17 to take first in the breastroke, and<br />\nMike O'Donnell clinched the 200 breastroke with<br />\na 2.27. Against excellent competition, Hopkin's<br />\nlone diver, Ken Zonies, placed second in both the<br />\none and three meter diving.<br />\n<br />\nThree days later, the varsity had a better time<br />\nof it, defeating Drexel 69 to 26. Hopkins swimmers<br />\ntook nine firsts. Both Marc Solomon and senior<br />\nBrian Turner were double winners. Solomon won<br />\nthe 200 free and the 200 fly. Turner took first in<br />\nthe 50 free and the 100 free. Scott and O'Donnell<br />\ncopped two more first in the backstroke and breaststroke events, and team captain Rick Ware took<br />\nthe 200 yard individual medley. Hopkins also won<br />\nboth the 400 yard free and medley relays.<br />\nThese two meets were the exact opposite of what<br />\nthey were last year when Hopkins beat Delaware<br />\nand lost to Drexel. It is also indicative, in a way,<br />\nof the change in the team this year. Last year's<br />\nteam was good but larger when it defeated Delaware, than lost several swimmers to illness and<br />\ncould not handle Drexel. The team that beat Drexel<br />\nso soundly this year is essentially the same size<br />\nas the one that lost last year, but much stronger.<br />\n<br />\nDefeat Drexel<br />\nThe freshman team this year is dynamite and<br />\ncontains some of the best potential swimmers in<br />\nthe short history of the team.

There<br />\nare now more than 300 people who have<br />\nbeen in the City Jail for more thanthree<br />\nmonths and up to two years awaiting trial.<br />\nAnd there are almost 7,000 criminal indictments that still haven't been tried.If<br />\nall crime ceased tomorrow,it would take<br />\nmore than thirteen months to dispose of<br />\nthese thousands of criminal indictments.<br />\nBut crime is not going to stop, and the<br />\nsituation is deteriorating rapidly: For<br />\nevery two cases that are moved out of<br />\nthe system, three new ones come in.<br />\n<br />\nThe Court System<br />\nThe court system in Baltimore has all<br />\nbut collapsed. The city is nearly bankrupt,<br />\nand the result is that the court system<br />\nin this city is probably the most antiquated and understaffed one of any major<br />\nmetropolitan area in the nation. From<br />\nthe office of the State's Attorney of Baltimore City, which is in charge of prosecutions, to the seven full-time judges<br />\nof the Criminal Court, the effects of<br />\nBaltimore's outdated system of justice<br />\nare becoming all too obvious.<br />\nBaltimore's court system is supposed<br />\nto run like this: After a man is arrested for a crime, he must be brought to<br />\none of nine Municipal Courts for a preliminary hearing. At this level, the<br />\narresting officer presents the charge,<br />\nand on the rare occasions the judge thinks<br />\nthere are no grounds for the case, it is<br />\ndismissed. But usually, if it's a misdemeanor (maximum penalty no more than<br />\n3 years and/or fine of $1,000) trial will<br />\nbe set for a later date before the Municipal Court judge. On the other hand, if<br />\nit is a felony or the suspect requests a<br />\n<br />\njury trial, the case is sent up to the Grand<br />\nJury for consideration.In an overwhelming majority of the cases, an indictment<br />\nis handed down to the Criminal Court,<br />\nthe suspect is arraigned, and a trial<br />\ndate is set.

At that<br />\ntime, if the judge determines that the<br />\nsuspect can't afford a lawyer, he will be<br />\nappointed one from a pool of private lawyers who are paid for their services by<br />\nthe Criminal Court.<br />\nOnly in capital crimes, like homicide<br />\nand kidnapping, can a suspect be denied<br />\nbail. For some of the poor, there is the<br />\nPre-Trial Release program.<br />\nThe Pre-Trial Release program is a<br />\nFederally-funded, experimental approach to the problem of the poor unable<br />\nto make bail. Through a negative and<br />\npositive point system, it tries to determine so objectively as possible if a poor<br />\nsuspect can be let out without bail. If it<br />\nwasn't for this program, twice as many<br />\npeople would be in the City Jail awaiting<br />\ntrial. The positive factors that are considered include family ties, employment,<br />\npermanent residence, and health problems. On the negative side, if his prior<br />\nrecord shows: at least three significant<br />\nmisdemeanors or a felony in the last five<br />\nyears, not showing up at court, or conclusive evidence of drug addiction or<br />\nalcholism, it is likely he will not be released.<br />\nThe problem is, though, that there are<br />\nonly six people assigned under this program to cover the CityJail,andthey can<br />\nenter it for a short time each day.

Just to stand still, we<br />\nwould need three more full-time judges,<br />\nand all of the staff and the courtroom that<br />\ngoes with a judge. We would need six more<br />\njudges on top of that, estimates the State's<br />\nAttorney's Office, to bring the existing<br />\nbacklog down to manageable proportions.<br />\nFor those in jail, the difficulties are<br />\nequally as great. Hundreds of those who<br />\nhave been stuck in the City Jail for months<br />\nand even years on end have never been<br />\nnotified of their right to request a speedy<br />\ntrial. And the court - appointed counsel,<br />\nwith the burdens of a private practice, is<br />\nall too often less than zealous in the pursuit of his client's rights.<br />\nWhat all this adds up to is a court system that by its very nature denies to those<br />\narrested some of their most fundamental<br />\nconstitutional rights.<br />\n<br />\nat the Municipal Court level. We are the<br />\nonly major city in the United States where<br />\nthis occurs. A number of major reports,<br />\nincluding those of the President's Crime<br />\nCommission, the Baltimore Grand Jury,<br />\nthe Baltimore Bar Association, the<br />\nAmerican Bar Association, and the<br />\nMayor's Crime Commission, have recommended the overwhelming need for<br />\nproscutors at the lower court level.

For its 46 lawyers there<br />\nare only four stenographers to take care<br />\nof the enormous amount of dictation and<br />\ntYping that has to be done.

Whenever necessary CHAP will make the appointment,<br />\nescort the person to the agency and help<br />\nwith the forms.<br />\nPeople who have received some type<br />\nof health service before contacting<br />\nCHAP, and who have found dissatisfaction with some aspect of their care,<br />\nmay register their complaint and have it<br />\ninvestigated.<br />\nAccording to Daryle B. Matthews, a<br />\nYear III medical student and originator<br />\nof CHAP, \"the role of coordinator of<br />\ncare, the<br />\nrole<br />\nof providing well<br />\nresearched<br />\ninformation is something<br />\nwhich is totally vacant in our present<br />\nhealth service. The role of advocate is<br />\nmore strongly needed as you travel down<br />\nthe ladder of the socio-economic scale.\"<br />\nCHAP's philosophy revolves around<br />\nservice intended to avert the possible<br />\nconsequences resulting from complex,<br />\nfragmented, impersonal health care.For<br />\ninstance, through the efforts of the<br />\nCHAP personnel, a woman was saved a<br />\n$700 hospital bill which charged her for<br />\nspecial duty nurses she had neither approved of nor been consulted about.<br />\nOther, CHAP services range from<br />\ninforming people about their rights under<br />\nMedicare and Medicaid to directing a<br />\n<br />\ncollege student on a bad drug trip to<br />\nthe best medical facility available.<br />\nCHAP was organized last summer by<br />\na group of eight students after it was<br />\napproved by the administration of the<br />\nMedical , School. A $10,000 grant from<br />\na private foundation was awarded to<br />\nfinance the program, Presently, there<br />\nare about 20 medical and nursing students operating CHAP.<br />\nCHAP is the only community-oriented<br />\nproject undertaken by medical students.<br />\nMost volunteers view this effort as a<br />\ntest of their interest and ability in organizing and running a program not totally<br />\ndependent upon Hopkins' support. Workers feel that CHAP is indicative of a<br />\ntrend in the medical and nursing schools<br />\ntoward increased involvement in political<br />\nareas. \"There are some of us who view<br />\nourselves as activists with leftist tendencies, although this is less prominent<br />\nhere at Hopkins than at most places,\"<br />\nsaid a student volunteer.<br />\nMatthews admits that CHAP has been<br />\nhaving some difficulty in providing adequate publicity about the program.<br />\nEfforts have been made in coordination<br />\nwith local Community Action Agencies to<br />\nreach those living in government housing<br />\nprojects in the inner-city. Other plans<br />\nfor future publicity include working with<br />\ncommunity school personnel and ministerial alliances of local church groups.<br />\nCHAP is now operating out of a rowhouse office at 709 Rutland Avenue.Facilities are provided by Hopkins Hospital<br />\nand share with the Drug Abuse Center<br />\nlocated in the same building.<br />\nThe greatest threat to CHAP appears<br />\nto be the lack of funding to keep the<br />\nproject operational. The Student Medical<br />\n<br />\nMedical student Daryl Matthews is one of the participants in the Community Health Advocacy<br />\nProgram at the East Baltimore campus.<br />\nAssociation has been solicited. Also,<br />\nbeing formed to ask for<br />\nplans are<br />\ndonations from private physicians in the<br />\nBaltimore area.<br />\nRather than close CHAP, a merger<br />\nwith another agency is being discussed.<br />\nOne possibility is The People's Clinic,<br />\nan organization sponsored by the Black<br />\nPanthers and Baltimore Defense Committee (BDC).<br />\nThe People's Clinic is designed to<br />\nserve both white and black residents of<br />\nWest Baltimore, The Panthers and BDC<br />\nclaim they are trying to fill the gap<br />\nbetween patient needs and the services<br />\nbeing provided.<br />\nTo eliminate the \"indifference to the<br />\nreal human needs of the individual,\"<br />\n<br />\nthe People's Clinic will serve not only<br />\nthe patient's medical needs, but housing,<br />\nnutritional, and other social needs as<br />\nwell. The clinic will be open on a 24<br />\nhour basis in order to give patients<br />\nthe opportunity to receive care without<br />\nforf eiting working hours.<br />\nThe clinic's organizers have asked for<br />\ndonations in order to initiate action. A<br />\nbuilding in the Franklin Square area of<br />\nWest Baltimore has been selected but<br />\nmoney is not available for rent payments.<br />\nMedical equipment, supplies, drugs and<br />\nstaff are still needed.<br />\nA Community Information Center is<br />\nplanned to operate out of the People's<br />\nClinic to provide legal aid, birth control<br />\nand abortion counselling, housing aid<br />\nand pre-natal advise.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nB and M Held Up<br />\nThree armed robbers entered the B and M Subshop,<br />\nrifled the cash register and robbed five customers of<br />\nover $100 last Saturday night.<br />\nAs the men were leaving one was frightened by a noise<br />\nfrom one of the freezers (the one with ice-cream in it)<br />\nand fired his gun at the younger Joe Bataglia, but the<br />\nweapon mis-fired and no injury was incurred.<br />\nAccording to Joe, two of the men entered the shop at<br />\nabout 10:30 p.m. and looked around before going outside.<br />\nThey came back about an hour later with another man,<br />\nforced all the customers into the back room and made<br />\nJoe and Salina stand behind the meat counter.<br />\nJoe said that when he called in the robbery to the police, he was still talking to the receptionist as officers<br />\narrived on the scene. He also claimed that the heist was<br />\nvery well planned with one man standing by the door and<br />\nanother holding a gun on those in the store. The third<br />\ntook the money.<br />\nAccording to an News Letter editor, Joe makes \"the<br />\nbest meat-ball sub in the world.\" Another claims that<br />\nhe is the \"finest sub maker in the business.\"<br />\n<br />\nGuns, No Butter<br />\nRed China has begun an austerity drive designed to<br />\nheighten military preparedness and, at the same time,<br />\nimprove her economic condition.<br />\nUsing the threat of war with the Soviet Union, which<br />\nis believed to be causing genuine concern among authories, Chinese leaders are trying to unite the people in<br />\ntheir goal to conserve resources. Many analysts feel that<br />\nthe main purpose of the drive is to strengthen the economy<br />\nwhich has suffered from corruption and black-market<br />\nactivities. Reduced consumption of coal, petroleum and<br />\nelectricity has already been achieved, according to<br />\nreports.<br />\nThe reluctance to allow steel and tungsten ore to<br />\nleave the country has had an effect on world prices. The<br />\nstockpiling of grain and other resources by localities is<br />\nbeing urged by Peking officials to create self-sufficient<br />\nareas which could play vital, strategic roles in cases of<br />\nforeign invasion.<br />\nThe leader in the economy drive has been the army.<br />\nBy saving on building materials and fuel, and by innovating frugal practices like sterilizing used bandages for<br />\nfurther use, the army has not only set an example to the<br />\n700,000,000 Chinese but it has cut expenses by 6%.<br />\n<br />\nSpiro the Hero<br />\nIt seems that America's emerging hero, according to<br />\nTime Magazine, is Spiro Agnew.<br />\nThe man who bumbled his way through the 1968 campaign and was then the laughing stock of the nation has<br />\nnow assumed the role of world statesman and spokesman<br />\nfor middle America. It is no wonder that jokes have begun<br />\nto circulate about Agnew's dropping Nixon from the 1972<br />\nticket and that bumper stickers and posters glorifying<br />\nthe Vice President are popping up all over the nation.<br />\nHe is a top attraction for speaking engagements, and,<br />\njust recently, he was accorded the honor in the Gallup<br />\nPoll of being rated as the third most admired man in<br />\nAmerica. There is little doubt that the man who spoke<br />\nout against the news media and protesters reflects the<br />\nattitude of a vast segment of the population.<br />\nRepublican Party leaders view Agnew as their secret<br />\nweapon in the fall elections and see their chances of<br />\ngaining control of Congress enhanced by his presence on<br />\nthe campaign trail. If one finds all this hard to believe,<br />\nthe ivory tower complex and association with \"effete<br />\nsnobs\" may well account for it.<br />\n<br />\n'No Knock' Passes<br />\nA statute permitting federal agents to enter a home<br />\nwithout warning or identification if they believe narcotics<br />\nwould be destroyed inside has been passed by the Senate.<br />\nThe 70 to 15 vote on Tuesday followed a three day<br />\ndebate on the provision which will be added to the omnibus<br />\ndrug bill being prepared. Under the new statute, agents<br />\nsuspecting the probable destruction of narcotics by parties trying to escape arrest are entitled to a \"no-knock\"<br />\nwarrent by a judge.<br />\nIn addition to giving agents power to break into a home,<br />\nit also could be used in raids on offices of doctors under<br />\nsuspicion of illicit possession of narcotics.

Gordon has also requested comments on his discipline proposal from the administrative heads of<br />\nthe other divisions of the University. They<br />\nhave all sent back recommendations, however, what effect these will have on his<br />\nfinal decision is not clear.<br />\nTheir report begins by defining con:<br />\nduct which might require discipline as<br />\nthat which \"abridges the right; of other<br />\nindividuals or groups, especially as it<br />\naffects the educational goals of those<br />\nwithin the University community, or<br />\nthreatens their safety, health or property,<br />\nor conduct that causes damage to physical facilities of the University.\"<br />\n\"Normal Functioning\"<br />\nThese categories are considerably<br />\nnarrower than those proposed by the<br />\n'President. Students would not be sanctioned for disrupting \"the normal functioning of the University\" as the committee found that phrase from Gordon's report to \"have no substantial and specific<br />\nmeaning and thus was liable to be applied<br />\nto any situation which some particular<br />\nsection of the University \"found offensive.\"<br />\nIn an appendix to its report, the<br />\ncommittee enumerated the reasons for<br />\nmost of the changes made. It was made<br />\nclear that the student-faculty group felt<br />\nthat various groups in the University<br />\nwould inteipret \"normal functioning\" differently.<br />\nMoreover, the Committee removes<br />\nGordon's proposal for sanctions against<br />\n- \"conduct that significantly impairs the<br />\neffective relationship of the University to<br />\nthe larger community of which it is part.\"<br />\nThe Committee felt that this area was<br />\ncovered \"in a way that was far less open<br />\nto misinterpretation...\"<br />\nFurther, the Committee states that<br />\n\"the University will not intrude itself into<br />\nthe personal lives of its students nor will<br />\nit add sanctions for unlawful behavior<br />\nalready dealt with by civil authority, unless such behavior falls within the class of<br /><br />\nconduct described above.\" This phrase<br />\nwas included in the original proposal of<br />\nGordon's original Discipline Committee.<br />\nReview Board<br />\nThe remainder of the report is concerned with setting up a Review Board<br />\nto consider any major punishments incurred by students. Punishments would<br />\nbe limited to suspension under the proposal, with no mention of expulsion,<br />\nwhich was included in Gordon's state. ment.<br />\nThe Review Board iS composed of<br />\ntwo undergraduate students, two graduate<br />\nstudents, two faculty members and one<br />\nadministrator. This adds two more students than Gordon's proposal. The members will be chosen by random selection.<br />\nThis board would conduct a trial of<br />\nany student sanctioned by suspension,<br />\nwith the power to sustain, increase or<br />\ndecrease the punishment or to exonerate<br />\nthe student.<br />\nEmergency Situations<br />\nThis section significantly differs from<br />\nGordon's recommendations on one point,<br />\nthe procedure in case of -an emergency.<br />\nUnder Gordon's proposal, if the administration felt that an emergency situation<br />\nexisted, it could apply immediate sanctions, with the Review Board considering<br />\nthe sanction after the fact.<br />\nThe new proposal has the Review<br />\nBoard convening \"by the next day\" in an<br />\nemergency situation, instead of the usual<br />\nrule of \"within five days.\"<br />\nBob Cotter, president of the Graduate Student Organization, and member of<br />\nthe Committee on Student Affairs, disagreed with the designation of any situation as an emergency one. He felt that<br />\nif the situation was not one .in which the<br />\npolice should be called in, then the normal procedures should be used. He felt<br />\nthat this emergency provision allowed the<br />\nadministration to avoid a confrontation.<br />\nHe said this does not offer \"any way of<br />\nexerting pressure by means of civil disobedience.\"<br />\nCotter also reported that the original<br />\nfinal draft of the committee's proposal<br />\nhad no administrators on the Review<br />\nBoard. It was only after a conversation<br />\nwith Gordon which the committee had,<br />\nthat one member changed his vote.<br />\n\" The reasoning tnat the committee<br />\nused at first to leave all administrators<br />\noff the committee, and later to limit their<br />\nmembcrship to one, was that since the<br />\nadministration was the prosecutor in these<br />\ncases, it should not have equal representation.

The letter of protest<br />\nsent by Freshman President David<br />\nCharry this week to Dean Swanson, was<br />\nrerouted to the Student Affairs Committee. It will be brought up at next Wednesday's meeting. If it is rejected, the<br />\nboycotters will have to face another semester of gym.<br />\nAlthough the freshmen maintain that<br />\nthere was no clear policy boycott and<br />\nno recruitment for the action, approximately 130 of them signed a \"complicity statement,\" indicating that they<br />\nwere not attending gym classes. Unofficial figures indicated that 140 students<br />\nfailed physical education for the first<br />\nsemester.<br /><br />\nWhite Vehement<br />\nAt the same time, Dr. John White,<br />\nChairman of the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs, vehemently denied that the boycott was responsible for the ultimate<br />\nsettlement of the issue. \"The action only<br />\nhurt the cause,\" he stated. \"The three<br />\nstudents who brought in the petition handled the situation correctly. We then reacted to them properly by having our<br /><br />\nAthletic Subcommittee look into the matter. That is what committees like Student Affairs are for.\"<br />\nA petition asking for an end to compulsory gym and a general upgrading of<br />\nthe physical education program was signed by 370 Freshmen and delivered to<br />\nDean Swanson's office on October 6.<br />\nSwanson officially forwarded the petition to the Student Affairs Committee<br />\non October 29, and from there it went<br />\nto the Permanent Subcommittee on Athletics.<br /><br />\n\"No Muddle\"<br />\n\"The power structure between committees is unclear,\" White admitted,<br />\n\"but there was no muddle about this.<br />\nSwanson wrote that his committee (the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate Studies)<br />\nwas not competent in the area of athletics, and we had a subcommittee that<br />\nwas. It's as simple as that.\" The Athletic<br />\nsubcommittee was set up in September as<br />\na \u2022 result of faculty complaints that the<br />\nphysical education program did not leave<br />\nthem enough time .slots for adequate use<br />\nof the gymnasium.<br />\nOn November 20, during a meeting with<br />\nDavid Charry, Jim Owens and various<br />\nother leaders of the movement, the subcommittee was informed of the boycott<br />\naction. Dr. Jackson Cope, chairman of<br />\nthe subcommittee, remarked that he was<br />\n\"surprised\" by the move, and thought<br />\nthat the signers were \"exerting undue<br />\npressure\" upon a committee which was<br />\nin the process of coming to a conclusion.<br />\n\"I told them I though that the second<br />\npetition made a strange bedfellow with<br /><br />\nthe original one, and that those who had<br />\nsigned both were being rather inconsistent,\" he explained.<br />\nMr. Charry maintains that the Freshmen resorted to staying away from gym<br />\nclasses because they were afraid that<br />\notherwise the subcommittee would take<br />\nits time on reaching a conclusion and<br />\nthat the question would remain unresolved into the second semester. \"It would<br />\nnever have been decided had there been<br />\nno pressure,\" he claimed.<br />\n\"Look,\" he continued, \"the subcommittee is heavily weighted toward the<br />\nPhysical Education Department.The boycott stopped the stalling. It wasn't aimed<br />\nagainst the committee--just against the<br />\nsubcommittee.\" Besides Cope, the subcommittee consists of Coach Alex Sotir,<br />\nDirector of Athletics Marshall Turner,<br />\ngraduate student Richard Barchi, and<br />\nundergraduates John Hammond and Paul<br />\nAllen.<br />\nDr. Cope disagreed with Mr. Charry's<br />\nanalysis. \"If you're asking whether the<br />\nsecond document (the boycott) had any<br />\neffect on either the committee or the subcommittee, the answer is `no'.\"<br /><br />\nPlan Rejected<br />\nOn December 10 the subcommittee's<br />\nfull plan for athletics, including one semester of compulsion, was released to<br />\nWhite's committee and promptly rejected. \"For me,\" White said, \"the (subcommittee's) advice didn't prove acceptable enough to demand compulsion.\"<br />\nThe committee then decided to abolish<br /><br />\nthe requirement, but not to make it retroactive to September, 1969. \"As far as<br />\nexplained,<br />\nconcerned,\"<br />\nWhite<br />\nI'm<br />\n\"everyone has a complete right to do<br />\nanything he wants to do through channels.<br />\nIf you ask someone to look at something<br />\nand you see that he is doing something,<br />\nthen you don't suddenly, right inthe middle, say we're not going to abide by the<br />\nrule as it now exists.\"<br />\n\"I don't believe in a physical education requirement for graduation. But it<br />\nbecomes continually more difficult to<br />\nmake rational decisions with a boycott<br />\ngoing on behind your back. The boycott<br />\nmade it much more difficult for all of<br />\nus.\"<br /><br />\nA Punishment?<br />\nCharry claims that the non-retroactive<br />\nclause in the recommendation is a punishment against the boycotters. \"There<br />\nis no question about it,\" he exclaimed.<br />\nWhite maintains that the action was<br />\n\"absolutely and categorically not\" a<br />\npunishment. \"The previous law exists<br />\nuntil the succeeding one takes over,\"<br />\nhe contended. \"The people who stuck<br />\nwith it have done it and those who haven't.<br />\nstill have it to do. Denying due process<br />\nmeans punishing those who went to gym.\"<br />\nIn Charry's view, this is \"circuitous\"<br />\nreasoning. \"The people who went to gym<br />\nare very thankful for what the others have<br />\ndone. I don't see how my going to gym<br />\nfirst semester could be construed a punishment. Go ask any of the Freshman.<br />\nYou'll see--none of them would feel punished if the boycotters were let off.

He defined \"substantial\"<br />\nas about 80%, or $2.4 million, of the loss.<br />\nThe 1969-70 budget exceeds $125 million,<br />\nincluding the Applied Physics Laboratory's $50 million budget.<br /><br />\nConscious Policy<br />\nThis was the second straight year that<br />\nHopkins has dipped into its capital reserves to break even. in 1968-69, the<br />\nUniversity ran $500,000 in the red. The<br />\nbudget has shown a $200,000 to $300,000<br />\nprofit in past years.<br />\nPresident Gordon claimed that the deficit in the past two years was a conscious policy of the Board of Trustees.<br />\n\"We decided we would rather run a temporary loss than cut back programs,\" he<br />\nremarked. However, due to expected increases and government research cuts,<br />\nthis year's budget will run $1 million<br />\nmore in the red than anticipated by the<br />\nTrustees last spring.<br />\nThe same policy will be in effect for<br />\nHopkins' finances in 1970-71. Kerley<br />\nstated that last Wednesday the Trustees Budget Committee decided to adopt<br />\n\"a conscious budgeting of the operating<br />\ndeficit by dipping into quasi-endowment<br />\nfunds.\"<br /><br />\n\"The coming budget is going to have to<br />\ngo up because of inflation,' he noted.<br />\nNevertheless, Dr. William Bevan, VicePresident and Provost, said, \"It will be<br />\nan exceedingly tight year. There's no<br />\nsecret about that.\"<br />\nDr. Gordon maintained that Hopkins<br />\nwas not alone in its financial plight. He<br />\ncalled the financial erosion of the country's private universities a \"serious<br />\nand nationwide problem.\"<br />\nThe President cited three major reasons why Hopkins is losing money: the<br />\ncutbacks in federal grants to universities, the rise in wages for nonprofessional workers and the inflationary spiral<br />\nthat has increased all expenditures.<br /><br />\nCutbacks and Increases<br />\nGovernment-financed research has<br />\nbeen on the decline for the last few years<br />\nat Hopkins. According to Bevan, this is<br />\nbecause Hopkins has ended much of its<br />\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) contracts,<br />\nand government officials have recently<br />\nbeen dissatisfied with basic research at<br />\nuniversities compared to applied reDOD conindustries.<br />\nsearch in<br />\ntracts have dropped as a percentage of<br />\nthe University's total research monies<br />\nfrom 18% to 8% in the past five years.<br />\nFoundations, led by the Ford Foundation, also have become discouraged with<br />\nprojects sponsored by the nation's<br />\nuniversities, said Dr. Bevan. He noted<br /><br />\nthat many local community action groups<br />\nare now being funded by foundations.<br />\nThe National Institute of Health and<br />\nNational Science Foundation fellowship<br />\ngrants have declined drastically.In 1967,<br />\nthere were 95 NIH fellowship awards.<br />\nThere may be none this year. There<br />\nhave also been major cuts in NSF grants<br />\nand contracts.<br />\nIn December Congress passed a bill<br />\nproviding $1 billion more for the Health,<br />\nEducation, and Welfare budget than President Nixon requested. The money, $134<br />\nmillion which would go to universities,<br />\nwas vetoed by President Nixon last week.<br /><br />\nUnless Congress overrules the President, Hopkins will be among the losers.<br />\nGordon estimated that if wage increases for Hopkins' nonprofessional<br />\nemployees follow the agreement reached<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins Hospital, it will cost<br />\nthe University $500,000 more than anticipated from January to June 1970,and<br />\n$1.5 million additional in the 1970-71<br />\nbudget.<br />\nFaculty salaries have been rising with<br />\ninflation at a rate of about 6-8% in past<br />\nyears, and the President expects the increases to continue.

A<br />\nMaster Plan is in the making to relieve<br />\nthe present bottlenecks in the parking and<br />\nbuilding facilities on campus.<br />\nAccording to John McElwee,the Secretary of the Buildings and Grounds Committee for the Board of Trustees, four<br />\narchitectural firms are under consideration for the task of renovating Homewood<br />\narchitecture and constructing a parking<br />\ngarage on the Campus.<br />\nAdoption of the plan depends heavily on<br />\nthe passage of legislation currently pending in the State legislature. The bill calls<br />\nfor the creation of a state authority that<br />\nwill sell special revenue bonds to finance<br />\ncollege and hospital construction.<br />\nUnder the terms of the bill, several individual institutions can borrow money<br />\nfrom the Authority in one package loan.<br /><br />\nTax-exempt bond issues will then be sold<br />\nat low interest rates to \"anyone who<br />\nbids.\"<br /><br />\n\u2022'Lending Authority<br /><br />\nThe authority will lend money to colleges and hospitals for the retirment of<br />\noutstanding loans and mortgages carrying higher interest rates, as well as for<br />\nnew construction projects.<br />\nPresident Gordon proposed the Authority to Governor Marvin Mandel last<br />\nsummer. The Governor then had it prefiled, to be proposed to the General Assembly in the beginning of 1970. Because<br />\nit has the Governor's support, McElwee<br />\nis optimistic that it will pass the Legislature by summer.<br />\nIf so, he expects construction on the<br />\ngarage to begin by the end of this year.<br />\nIt should be completed by the end of<br />\n1971.<br /><br />\nThe garage will be located on the southwest side of the campus, in the Hopkinsowned portion of Wyman Park. Its cost<br />\nis predicted as $2.5 million.<br /><br />\n\u2022 Community Opposition<br />\nAlthough his committee will \"see how<br />\nbest to workwith the community,\" objection to the plan is expected from residents who wish to preserve the wooded<br />\narea.<br />\nThe garage will provide 11,000 spaces.<br />\nHowever, McElwee believes the \"parking situation is still going to be tight.\"<br />\nSome parking spaces that are available<br />\ntoday will be removed to make way for<br />\nconstruction on other parts of the campus he said, and additions to Schaffer<br />\nHall are expected to extend into the adjacent parking lot. The expected growth<br />\nof the University, including the need for<br />\nhousing facilities for women, will also<br />\ndetermine the number of parking spaces,<br />\nMcElwee added.<br />\nThe bond financing will also be utilized<br />\nto subsidize the construction of new<br />\nbuildings.

The Baltimore Gas and Electric Company had previously cut off the<br />\nPanthers' utilities after they failed to<br />\npay $600 in bills. The company restored<br />\nservice after the Committee payed about<br /><br />\none quarter of the Panthers' total bill<br />\naccording to Jim Archibald, Student Association President.<br />\nThe Committee now plans to concentrate on the police harassment of the<br />\nlocal Panthers. Dr. Wickwire stated that<br />\nhe has been in contact with Governor<br />\nMandel's office, and that a meeting to discuss the problem should take place<br />\nbefore February 15.<br />\nIn regard to police persecution, John<br />\nClarke, one of the Panther's present at<br />\nthe meeting, alleged that the Baltimore<br />\npolice have the party headquarters under<br />\nconstant surveillance from a stake-out<br />\nin a gas station opposite the Panthers'<br />\nbuilding. Clark emphasized that police<br />\nharassment extends not only to the Panthers but to the entire black community.<br />\nAccording to Clark the police \"occupy<br />\nour community like troops\" and \"are<br /><br />\nthere to watch, harass and murder us.\"<br />\nGhetto Drugs<br />\nIn addition to harassment of blacks,<br />\nClark charged that the police were doing<br />\nnothing to halt the growth of drug addiction in the ghetto. Police action against<br />\nnarcotics traffic is always directed<br />\nagainst the ghetto resident who uses or<br />\npushes drugs, but never against the outsider who distributes them on a large<br />\nscale as part of organized crime. The<br />\npower structure, Clark alleged, is ready<br />\nto allow drug addiction to reach the same<br />\nepidemic proportions which alcoholism<br />\nreached among American Indians.<br />\nThe Panthers also discussed their<br />\nefforts to provide services to the neglected members of the black community<br />\nthrough a free medical clinic and a breakfast program for school children. Currently the Panthers are attempting to<br /><br />\nraise money to purchase a building to<br />\nhouse the clinic at 14 Carey Street. The<br />\nclinic would dispense basic medical services and advice to the local community.<br />\nNurses at Hopkins Hospital have volunteered to staff the clinic.<br />\nThe breakfast program currently is<br />\nserving between twenty and forty children<br />\na day. Clark said that the low participation was due to bad weather and that<br />\nin the spring as many as three hundred<br />\nchildren participate in the program.<br />\nDr. Vernon Dobson, President of the<br />\nBaltimore Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance and a member of the Political Freedom Committee, concurred<br />\nwith the Panthers' assertions of oppression of the black community by governmental authorities and declared that the<br />\nproblem of urban survival for blacks was<br />\na national one.<br /><br />\nWorker Pay Hike Under Consideration<br />\npay and benefits the way the Hospital<br />\nemployees are being treated.\"<br /><br />\nWith or without a union, Hopkins<br />\nemployees may be in for a substantial<br />\npay raise - - or so says the University's<br />\nbudget.

Rumblings of dissatisfaction over Homewood's antiquated and clumsy decision-making processes emanated from many segments<br />\nof the community.<br />\nDr. George Owen proposed last September a University Senate which<br />\nwould represent students, faculty and administrators. At the time, we<br />\nsupported the plan, and the Student Council and the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization both sent letters to Dr. Gordon, advocating the creation of a<br />\nUniversity Senate. Dr. Owen's plan was submitted to the Academic<br />\nCouncil and has been sat on for four months. The Academic Council's<br />\ncommittee-to-appoint-the-committee-gambit effectively forstalled any significant action to this point. The Student Council has held grandiose<br />\n\"tactics sessions,\" created a committee and reassured its constituents of<br />\nits \"firm stance.\" The Graduate Student Organization has issued similar<br />\nstatements and done equally little.<br />\nIn short, students seem content to \"let the matter go through channels,\" and it seems not to matter that the channels are clogged with the<br />\nsewage of \"professorial courtesy,\" face-saving and misleading verbiage. It<br />\nis time students realized that nothing is being done about governance, and<br />\nthat nothing will be done this year if the Academic Council is allowed to<br />\nproceed at its own pace. It is not to the advantage of the faculty to<br />\nchange the system of governance at Homewood. As it stands, faculty<br />\nwishes are unhindered by annoying student demands. It is unrealistic to<br />\nsuppose that the faculty will act with all possible speed to deprive itself<br />\nof its privileged status.<br />\nLast year, students at Homewood demonstrated that they could<br />\nforce the system to respond to legitimate demands. It seemed to the<br />\nAcademic Council and the administration that calendar reform could not<br />\npossibly be enacted in time for the fall term of the present school year.<br />\nA militant stance by students quickly convinced the policy makers that<br />\ncalendar reform was not only feasible but necessary.<br />\nThis week, Dr. Woodford Howard stated that the March deadline<br />\nfor his committee's report is \"unrealistic.\" However, if the March deadline is not met, governance reform will not be possible by next year.<br />\nDr. Howard's committee is charged with determining whether \"widespread dissatisfaction\" over governance exists. Presumably they will take<br />\ninto account whether dissatisfaction exists among the students. It is indicative of the faculty's attitude toward' the S.C. and G.S.O. that it did not<br />\ninterpret their letters as showing student dissatisfaction.<br />\nThe faculty may believe that if student opinion were united in dissatisfaction with governance, much more would have been heard from<br />\nstudent representatives. Certainly, these representatives should do more<br />\nthan send one letter affirming their \"firm stance.\" As a first step, they<br />\nmight poll those they represent to see if the dissatisfaction exists. If it<br />\ndoes, they should be prepared to exert as much pressure as possible to see<br />\nthat governance is not let slide another year.<br />\n,<br />\nIMMO<br /><br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br /><br />\nRichard B.

It was, most agreed, an impressive speech which served to both<br />\nset admiral goals for the next decade<br />\nand at the same time steal central issues<br />\nfrom<br />\nthe democrats in Congress.<br />\nAnalysis of the speech reveals much the<br />\nsame impression that one gets from the<br />\nentire Nixon performance to date: a lot<br />\nof cheap talk.<br />\nThe President, after again implying<br />\nthat patriotism is synonymous with support of his questionable peace \"plan,\"<br />\ntalked at great length about the issues of<br />\ncrime and the quality of the environment. In meeting these two challenges,<br />\nthe President said, there can be no rigid<br />\npartisanship.<br />\nWhen he came to the first issue of<br />\ncrime in the streets, Mr.Nixon immediately blamed the democratically controlled Congress for holding up his crime<br />\nmeasures. The President did admit,<br />\nperhaps for the first time, that crime is<br />\nbasically a local problem. However, the<br />\nFederal government's anti-crime budget<br />\nwill double in the next fiscal year.<br />\nAbsent from the message was any mention of crimes of a different sort: the<br />\ndeprivation of voting rights in the South<br />\nor lethargy in enforcing Supreme Court<br />\ndesegregation orders.<br />\nIgnoring Complications<br />\nWhile the President spoke of the way<br />\nin which organized crime and pornography make society sick, he failed to<br />\nmention other sickness, such as inadequate housing, food and education. To<br />\nthe contrary, he this week vetoed the<br /><br />\nOlander<br /><br />\n.t.E.W. appropriations bill, which, he<br />\nsaid, contains too much money for education.<br />\nSo on crime, the President is mostly<br />\ntalking to his precious \"Silent Majority.\"<br />\nThis group, the President correctly believes, is more concerned with the symptoms than the causes of crime.<br />\nWhen the President spoke about polution and the destruction of the environment, he again spoke to the \"Silent<br />\nMajority.\" For clean air is not of concern<br />\nto the hungry; clean waters are of little<br />\nvalue to the many that never leave a<br />\nparticular urban neighborhood. This is<br />\nnot meant as criticism of the very commendable job the President did of committing himself to the cause of nature.<br />\nThe trouble is that Mr. Nixon believes<br />\nthat spending money for one domestic<br />\nprogram is a dramatic reordering of<br />\npriorities. Also the President is not<br />\nignorant of the fact that polution is one<br />\nof the most politically valuable causes<br />\ntoday.<br />\nNon-Partisan Purge<br />\nMatching the Nixon rhetoric to the Nixon action is an interesting exercise.<br />\nRemembering the self-professed abdication of rigid partisanship made by the<br />\nPresident on behalf of this issue, it is<br />\ninteresting to note that H.E.W. is currently removing every picture and quotation belonging to Senator Muskie from<br />\nall government literature on the subject<br />\nof polution. Though Mr. Muskie has long<br />\nbeen the senate authority on improving<br />\nthe environment, he suffers the misfortune of being a democrat.<br />\nContinued on p. 12<br /><br />\nPAGE ii<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nJan. 30, 1970<br /><br />\nJulius rs.

No more<br />\nsomnambulent jurors. Asked his profession, he replies,<br />\n\"poet and chanter.\" He is then askedwhere he studied the<br />\naforementioned chanting. The question elicits a long,<br />\nrambling reply which uses dozens of Buddhist names,all of<br />\nwhich the middle-aged stenographer dutifully struggles<br />\nwith.<br /><br />\nThe polemics begin, and the belligerent government<br />\nattorney initiates a steady stream of objections. The judge,<br />\nwith near monotouous regularity, sustains them. On the<br />\nstand is Phil Ochs, well-known singer, who keeps annoying the earnest young man prosecuting the government's<br />\ncase by continually elaborating the answers to the questions posed him by Kuntsler. The attorney finally objects,<br /><br />\n\"Oh, no, I've taken you to task, but never<br />\ngotten angry.\"<br /><br />\nand Mr. Magoo admonishes the witness to pay closer attention to the questions asked, whereupon Kunstler interjects, \"Your honor, many of our witnesses are unused to<br />\ntestifying.\" (to Ochs) \"You're learning the hard way.\"<br />\nHoffman interrupts, \"And the proper way.\"<br />\nKunstler: \"Your Honor, that was a good one.\"(laughter)<br />\nHoffman? \"I just didn'twant you to thinking that I treat<br />\nwitnesses in this case any different from those in any<br /><br />\nother.\"<br />\nKunstler: \"I was complimenting your Honor.\"(laughter)<br />\nHoffman: \"I have my doubts about that, but I'll let it go.\"<br />\n(laughter)<br />\nOchs' testimony continues, and he once more begins<br />\nelaborating on the questions asked him. The prosecutor<br />\nstarts a vigorous objection, and the judge once again<br />\nadmonishes Ochs to pay closer attention to the questions<br />\nposed him, beginning his admonition with, \"Young man,<br />\nyou're a singer, but you're smart.\"<br />\nThe testimony has been centering on Ochs' relation-<br /><br />\nAfter a certain period of time, the government finally<br />\nobjects, saying that the jury has a good enough idea of the<br />\nwitness's qualifications. Hoffman, after ruling, comments<br />\nsomewhat wryly, \"I have a vague idea of the witness's<br />\nprofession. Its vague, but I have an idea. I know he said<br />\nhe was a poet. The rest I don't know about.\" (laughter).<br /><br />\nThe Mantra<br />\nThe defense further develops the theme of Ginsberg's<br />\nrelationship with the defendants Rubin and Hoffman.He is<br />\nasked about a February '68 press conference that he held<br />\nwith Rubin and Hoffman in New York. He replies that he<br />\nrecited a mantra, or Indian Chant, and launches into it<br />\nforthwith. The judge fumes while the spectators and even<br />\nthe government attorneys clutch at their sides in order to<br />\ncontrol their laughter. Hoffman states that the mantra is<br />\ninadmissable as part of the testimony because \"the language of the Federal Court of Northern Illinois is English.\"<br />\n(laughter)<br />\nKunstler replies that Latin has been admitted in U. S.<br />\nCourts. Hoffman replies that there is no translator,\"unless perhaps one of the ladies or gentlemenof the jury is<br />\nfamiliar with Sanskrit.\" He then smiles and admits that<br />\n\"Sanskrit is one I don't know.\"<br />\nDefense then introduces a red, box-like object, and asks<br />\nGinsberg to identify it, it being a harmonium.In response.<br />\nGinsberg plays a tune, and once more everybody begins to<br />\nsnicker. The Government objects, and Hoffman sustains<br />\nthe objection, declaring that \"the witness has been asked to<br />\nidentify it, and instead he has played us a tune.\" This is<br />\nthe last great bit of wisdom that is dispensed that afternoon, for with the coming of five o'clock the judge adjourns<br />\nthe court until ten o'clock the following morning.<br /><br />\nre a singer but you're smart.\"<br />\noung man, you'<br /><br />\ny<br /><br />\nThe Courtroom<br />\nThe room is panelled in rich squares of wood, and has<br />\ntrriodernistic wood benches that are apparently supposed<br />\nt\u00b0 he form -fitting. Over Judge Hoffman's seat hang pictires of Franklin, Jefferson, Washington, and others. Half<br />\n\u00b0I the room is cut off for the press, forcing the predominantlY young spectators to crowd into the back. Further<br />\n81:leculation about the aesthetic niceties of the United Stales District Court for the Northern District of Illinois is<br />\ncu<br />\nrtailed by the entrance of a dolly carrying some of the<br />\nProsecution's material, some of which conveniently falls<br />\n\u00b0n the floor just as Abbie Hoffman, complete with Indian<br />\nheadband and multi-colored shirt, strolls in. Hoffman<br />\nstet:Ts to pick up some of the papers, and immediately<br />\ncries ring<br />\nout of \"don't touch it.\"<br /><br />\nThe Defendants<br />\nHoffman grins, straightens up, and walks forwardwhile<br />\ns\u00b0Inebody shouts, \"Hoffman will do anything to zap the<br />\nPvernment's case.\" The other defendents begin to come<br />\n!n\u2022 They seem an oddly-mixed group; Dellinger,the greying pacifist, Hoffman,the radical, Hayden,self-proclaimed revolutionary, and the others.<br />\nThe jury enters, and then the judge. Of the fourteen<br />\njbliirc'rs, twelve are women, and three of those twelve are<br />\nl'ack. The Court is asked to rise, and in comes Hoffman,<br />\n\"king for all the world like Mr. Magoo, except that he<br />\ne\u00b04tinually wears the expression of a man much misunderstood.<br /><br />\n11 1OA5 WOW FOR<br />\nOS TO SET (K)TO<br />\nV611\\KA-<br /><br />\n6UT I2CMONSTRATIW<br />\nAGAINSTTIC C;OVVIRN NWT IS uk)PATRIOTIC.<br /><br />\nship with the defendants Hoffman and Rubin. Asked about<br />\na pre -convention rally, Ochs states, \"the crowd shouted<br />\nfuck L.B.J., and so did I.\" A victory sign is flashed to<br />\nOchs by Dellinger, who grins broadly. The jury seems<br />\nless attentive than the spectators, with one of the women<br />\ndozing. They are soon awakened however, upon the government's cross-examination of Ochs. The young lawyer<br />\naccuses Ochs of backing off under cross-examination from<br />\nprevious statements. He even calls the witness's testimony \"patent.\" Kunstler throws his legal tablet down on<br />\nthe floor in rage, shouting, \"your honor, I object.\"<br />\nHoffman: \"Sir, I will not permit you to address me in<br />\nthis tone. Let the record show that Mr. Kunstler threw his<br />\npapers to the floor.\"<br />\nKunstler: \"Your Honor, I got angry for a moment.

Ochs is asked what songs he sang during convention week. His guitar is presented to him and he is asked<br />\nif this is indeed the guitar upon which he played those<br />\nsongs. He assents. The defense asks that he be allowed<br />\nto sing some of those songs, whereupon the government<br />\nobjects, claiming that \"the defense is trying to turn this<br />\ntrial into a circus.\" Hoffman sustains the objection, and<br />\nlater, as Ochs steps down,the judge admonishes him not to<br />\nforget his guitar.<br />\nThe next witness for the defense is Allen Ginsberg, and<br /><br />\nt'OT LJEV 1.056 FACE<br />\nF L GOT OUT-<br /><br />\nsuppoRT -0-16<br />\nPRESIDela.<br /><br />\nVNI FOR 9AVI1J6<br />\nAHERICAK) LIVES-<br /><br />\nE3UT t 14511 (-1C0<br />\nCHAM66 H15 POI.ICIE5<br /><br />\nKunstler &amp; Co.adjourn to an adjacent room ,where Ginsberg, Ochs, and the defendants talk.

In the violence of our<br />\nactions, in the destruction we have<br />\ncaused, many of us have seen our country for the first time.<br />\nThe New York Times<br />\nis shocked by<br />\nthe slaughter at Song My: \"Reports of<br />\nthe deliberate, methodical killing of<br />\nhundreds of civilians - men, women and<br />\nchildren - by American troops in a Vietnamese village last year are so shocking, so contrary to the principles for<br />\nwhich this country has stood, as to be<br />\nbeyond belief,\" Where has the Times<br />\nbeen? Song My is no more isolated an<br />\nIncident than our treatment of black<br />\npeople, than Chicago, than two assassinations, than our condemning totalitarianism and supporting Thieu, Franco,<br />\nthe Greek junta and other bastions of<br />\ndemocracy in the free world. I am not<br />\nsaying that America is evil, only that<br />\nthe myth it believed of itself is being<br />\ntorn apart.<br />\nWe are just like everyone else now--in<br />\nsome ways very good, in other ways<br />\ncrass and sordid. \"The land of the free<br />\nand home of the brave\"; \"with liberty<br />\nand justice for all\"; dying so that others<br />\nwill be free--it all sounds strange now,<br />\nlike some \"asthmatic whisper\" from a<br />\nvague dream. The old words, the vision<br />\nof ourselves as a chosen people, are<br />\ndead. The vision died at Song My, at<br />\nHamburger Hill, at the town we destroyed<br /><br />\nto save, with the use of chemical warfare, and with the uprooting of four and<br />\na half million people in the country we<br />\nare protecting.<br /><br />\nWe Were As Gods<br />\nThose who still believe in the omnipotency and the God-like quality of<br />\nAmerica have their voice in the White<br />\nHouse. The more they cling to their<br /><br />\n\"silent majority\" to show the world that<br />\nAmerica is really behind the president<br />\non the war? It is possible that the administration knows exactly what it wants<br />\nand is using whatever it can to provoke<br />\nthe response they desire. It is also possible that they believe almost everything<br />\nthey say and are incapable of seeing the<br />\ncontradictions. What lies behind both is<br />\nthis cursed myth of America,an America<br /><br />\nbeliefs, the more darkness we spread.<br />\nDoes Nixon really believe the capsule<br />\nhistory he gave the country on November<br />\n3 on how we got into the war? Does<br />\nAgnew have any idea when he quotes<br />\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison just who the man<br />\nhe was quoting was? What does the administration think when they advertise<br />\nfree speech and then do everything they<br />\ncan to silence those who disagree with<br />\nthem, including making a film on the<br /><br />\nContinued on p. 14<br /><br />\nNixon Makes Mass Effort; Well, Not Really<br />\nContinued from p. 10<br />\nSpecifically, the President proposed a<br />\nten billion dollar, five year program<br />\nfor adequate water treatment facilities.<br />\nHe created the impression that this is<br />\na massive effort. A close look at the<br />\nproposal reveals its modesty. Under the<br />\nplan, the government would<br />\nNixon<br />\nactually only pay about four billion dollars in ten years. The rest would be<br />\nfinanced by local bonds. Even though<br />\nmost local governments are bonded up<br />\nto their financial necks. The Federal<br />\ncontribution proposed by the President is<br />\napproximately 250 million per year less<br />\nthan what is already appropriated for<br />\nwater pollution alone. Furthermore, the<br />\nPresident refused to spend several millions of this allocation in the last year.<br />\nMr. Nixon's policy is actually a step<br />\nbackward.<br /><br />\nThe inadequacies inherent in the<br />\nPresident's position appear even greater<br />\nupon close examination. As Hubert<br />\nHumphrey pointed out tliis week, the<br />\nPresident can suggest all the water<br />\ntreatment he likes without removing the<br />\ncause of the pollution: industrial waste.<br />\nAnd the only way that industry is going<br />\nto stop dumping untreated garbage into<br />\nthe water supplies is through vigorous<br />\ngovernment regulation of its disposal<br />\nprocedures. Will the President, a highly<br />\npartisan Republican, even suggest such<br />\nregulations? Or are the limitations of<br />\nhis political philosophy sufficient to rule<br />\nout a real solution? As James Reston<br />\nhas noted, after zig-zagging to the left<br />\nand right trying to please everyone, the<br />\nPresident will eventually have to go left<br />\non this issue if he is to live up to the<br /><br />\ntalk.<br />\nThe quality of the environment often<br />\nis concerned with the urban environment.<br />\nOne of the largest causes of urban pollution is the automobile. Will Mr. Nixon<br />\nstress rapid transit in the cities to cut<br />\ndown the choking traffic or favor more<br />\nand better highways to carry the \"Silent \u2022<br />\nMajority\" to work every morning?<br /><br />\nTreats Symptoms, Sewage<br />\nThe most laudable and also expected<br />\nthing the President said in his message<br />\nwas that having money is not the same<br />\nthing as having happiness and that future<br />\ngrowth must be redirected toward qualitative improvement.

The varsity swam three meets,<br />\nagainst P.M.C., University of Delaware, and<br />\nDrexel. They took two and dropped the one to<br />\nin a close meet. The frosh swimmers<br />\neat the Gettysburg College frosh and<br />\nbeat<br />\nlost to the<br />\nDelaware<br />\nfreshman.<br />\nThe Delaware meet was closer than the score<br />\nof 72 to 41 would seem. Hopkins beat them for the<br />\nfirst time last year with a larger team.This year<br />\nMost the individual swimmers were better, but the<br />\nteam had less depth and Delaware had more.JHU<br />\nlost the first event, the 400 medley relay, by only<br />\na tenth of<br />\na second. They came back to win the<br />\nsecond, the 1000 yard free style, with Marc Solomon taking first and Doc Hersberger securing a<br />\nneeded third.<br />\nAnother good race for Hopkins was the 200 butterfly. Marc Solomon and Gene Bonte came in first<br />\nand second,leaving the closest Delaware swimmer<br />\nfive seconds behind in third.Sophomore,Jim Scott,<br />\nswam a 2.17 to take first in the breastroke, and<br />\nMike O'Donnell clinched the 200 breastroke with<br />\na 2.27. Against excellent competition, Hopkin's<br />\nlone diver, Ken Zonies, placed second in both the<br />\none and three meter diving.<br /><br />\nThree days later, the varsity had a better time<br />\nof it, defeating Drexel 69 to 26. Hopkins swimmers<br />\ntook nine firsts. Both Marc Solomon and senior<br />\nBrian Turner were double winners. Solomon won<br />\nthe 200 free and the 200 fly. Turner took first in<br />\nthe 50 free and the 100 free. Scott and O'Donnell<br />\ncopped two more first in the backstroke and breaststroke events, and team captain Rick Ware took<br />\nthe 200 yard individual medley. Hopkins also won<br />\nboth the 400 yard free and medley relays.<br />\nThese two meets were the exact opposite of what<br />\nthey were last year when Hopkins beat Delaware<br />\nand lost to Drexel. It is also indicative, in a way,<br />\nof the change in the team this year. Last year's<br />\nteam was good but larger when it defeated Delaware, than lost several swimmers to illness and<br />\ncould not handle Drexel. The team that beat Drexel<br />\nso soundly this year is essentially the same size<br />\nas the one that lost last year, but much stronger.<br /><br />\nDefeat Drexel<br />\nThe freshman team this year is dynamite and<br />\ncontains some of the best potential swimmers in<br />\nthe short history of the team. Looking slightly into<br />\nthe future, that is, next season, one could predict<br />\nthat they will remedy the problem of depth on the<br />\nvarsity and add even more strength. This is something that coach Comfort hopes for.

There<br />\nare now more than 300 people who have<br />\nbeen in the City Jail for more thanthree<br />\nmonths and up to two years awaiting trial.<br />\nAnd there are almost 7,000 criminal indictments that still haven't been tried.If<br />\nall crime ceased tomorrow,it would take<br />\nmore than thirteen months to dispose of<br />\nthese thousands of criminal indictments.<br />\nBut crime is not going to stop, and the<br />\nsituation is deteriorating rapidly: For<br />\nevery two cases that are moved out of<br />\nthe system, three new ones come in.<br /><br />\nThe Court System<br />\nThe court system in Baltimore has all<br />\nbut collapsed. The city is nearly bankrupt,<br />\nand the result is that the court system<br />\nin this city is probably the most antiquated and understaffed one of any major<br />\nmetropolitan area in the nation. From<br />\nthe office of the State's Attorney of Baltimore City, which is in charge of prosecutions, to the seven full-time judges<br />\nof the Criminal Court, the effects of<br />\nBaltimore's outdated system of justice<br />\nare becoming all too obvious.<br />\nBaltimore's court system is supposed<br />\nto run like this: After a man is arrested for a crime, he must be brought to<br />\none of nine Municipal Courts for a preliminary hearing. At this level, the<br />\narresting officer presents the charge,<br />\nand on the rare occasions the judge thinks<br />\nthere are no grounds for the case, it is<br />\ndismissed. But usually, if it's a misdemeanor (maximum penalty no more than<br />\n3 years and/or fine of $1,000) trial will<br />\nbe set for a later date before the Municipal Court judge. On the other hand, if<br />\nit is a felony or the suspect requests a<br /><br />\njury trial, the case is sent up to the Grand<br />\nJury for consideration.In an overwhelming majority of the cases, an indictment<br />\nis handed down to the Criminal Court,<br />\nthe suspect is arraigned, and a trial<br />\ndate is set. The time between the preliminary hearing and the arraignment is<br />\nat least a month, and often more.<br /><br />\n1\u00b011LI<br />\n\\<br />\nERSLASIO<br /><br />\nPre-Trial Release<br />\nThere is no Public Defender system in<br />\nBaltimore, and if a poor suspect does not<br />\nrequest a lawyer, he will not be appointed one until the arraignment. At that<br />\ntime, if the judge determines that the<br />\nsuspect can't afford a lawyer, he will be<br />\nappointed one from a pool of private lawyers who are paid for their services by<br />\nthe Criminal Court.<br />\nOnly in capital crimes, like homicide<br />\nand kidnapping, can a suspect be denied<br />\nbail. For some of the poor, there is the<br />\nPre-Trial Release program.<br />\nThe Pre-Trial Release program is a<br />\nFederally-funded, experimental approach to the problem of the poor unable<br />\nto make bail. Through a negative and<br />\npositive point system, it tries to determine so objectively as possible if a poor<br />\nsuspect can be let out without bail. If it<br />\nwasn't for this program, twice as many<br />\npeople would be in the City Jail awaiting<br />\ntrial. The positive factors that are considered include family ties, employment,<br />\npermanent residence, and health problems. On the negative side, if his prior<br />\nrecord shows: at least three significant<br />\nmisdemeanors or a felony in the last five<br />\nyears, not showing up at court, or conclusive evidence of drug addiction or<br />\nalcholism, it is likely he will not be released.<br />\nThe problem is, though, that there are<br />\nonly six people assigned under this program to cover the CityJail,andthey can<br />\nenter it for a short time each day. Many<br />\nsuspects are not aware of the existence<br />\nof the- program, and so, as a spokesman<br /><br />\nCIF<br /><br />\nAt)<br />\nll'RIIEALTTIEG\\ITOE\\RTLA'SCSI(lARiniE<br />\nIPS0111\"ItiEl<br />\nEli.T<br /><br />\nphoto by hoffinann<br />\nPlacard located inside the Baltimore Municipal Courthouse on Madison and Calvert Streets.<br />\nadmitted, '<br />\n,There are people who are<br />\nnever even seen by the Pre-Trial Release program.\" Mrs. Elsbeth L.

Just to stand still, we<br />\nwould need three more full-time judges,<br />\nand all of the staff and the courtroom that<br />\ngoes with a judge. We would need six more<br />\njudges on top of that, estimates the State's<br />\nAttorney's Office, to bring the existing<br />\nbacklog down to manageable proportions.<br />\nFor those in jail, the difficulties are<br />\nequally as great. Hundreds of those who<br />\nhave been stuck in the City Jail for months<br />\nand even years on end have never been<br />\nnotified of their right to request a speedy<br />\ntrial. And the court - appointed counsel,<br />\nwith the burdens of a private practice, is<br />\nall too often less than zealous in the pursuit of his client's rights.<br />\nWhat all this adds up to is a court system that by its very nature denies to those<br />\narrested some of their most fundamental<br />\nconstitutional rights.<br /><br />\nat the Municipal Court level. We are the<br />\nonly major city in the United States where<br />\nthis occurs. A number of major reports,<br />\nincluding those of the President's Crime<br />\nCommission, the Baltimore Grand Jury,<br />\nthe Baltimore Bar Association, the<br />\nAmerican Bar Association, and the<br />\nMayor's Crime Commission, have recommended the overwhelming need for<br />\nproscutors at the lower court level.

Whenever necessary CHAP will make the appointment,<br />\nescort the person to the agency and help<br />\nwith the forms.<br />\nPeople who have received some type<br />\nof health service before contacting<br />\nCHAP, and who have found dissatisfaction with some aspect of their care,<br />\nmay register their complaint and have it<br />\ninvestigated.<br />\nAccording to Daryle B. Matthews, a<br />\nYear III medical student and originator<br />\nof CHAP, \"the role of coordinator of<br />\ncare, the<br />\nrole<br />\nof providing well<br />\nresearched<br />\ninformation is something<br />\nwhich is totally vacant in our present<br />\nhealth service. The role of advocate is<br />\nmore strongly needed as you travel down<br />\nthe ladder of the socio-economic scale.\"<br />\nCHAP's philosophy revolves around<br />\nservice intended to avert the possible<br />\nconsequences resulting from complex,<br />\nfragmented, impersonal health care.For<br />\ninstance, through the efforts of the<br />\nCHAP personnel, a woman was saved a<br />\n$700 hospital bill which charged her for<br />\nspecial duty nurses she had neither approved of nor been consulted about.<br />\nOther, CHAP services range from<br />\ninforming people about their rights under<br />\nMedicare and Medicaid to directing a<br /><br />\ncollege student on a bad drug trip to<br />\nthe best medical facility available.<br />\nCHAP was organized last summer by<br />\na group of eight students after it was<br />\napproved by the administration of the<br />\nMedical , School. A $10,000 grant from<br />\na private foundation was awarded to<br />\nfinance the program, Presently, there<br />\nare about 20 medical and nursing students operating CHAP.<br />\nCHAP is the only community-oriented<br />\nproject undertaken by medical students.<br />\nMost volunteers view this effort as a<br />\ntest of their interest and ability in organizing and running a program not totally<br />\ndependent upon Hopkins' support. Workers feel that CHAP is indicative of a<br />\ntrend in the medical and nursing schools<br />\ntoward increased involvement in political<br />\nareas. \"There are some of us who view<br />\nourselves as activists with leftist tendencies, although this is less prominent<br />\nhere at Hopkins than at most places,\"<br />\nsaid a student volunteer.<br />\nMatthews admits that CHAP has been<br />\nhaving some difficulty in providing adequate publicity about the program.<br />\nEfforts have been made in coordination<br />\nwith local Community Action Agencies to<br />\nreach those living in government housing<br />\nprojects in the inner-city. Other plans<br />\nfor future publicity include working with<br />\ncommunity school personnel and ministerial alliances of local church groups.<br />\nCHAP is now operating out of a rowhouse office at 709 Rutland Avenue.Facilities are provided by Hopkins Hospital<br />\nand share with the Drug Abuse Center<br />\nlocated in the same building.<br />\nThe greatest threat to CHAP appears<br />\nto be the lack of funding to keep the<br />\nproject operational. The Student Medical<br /><br />\nMedical student Daryl Matthews is one of the participants in the Community Health Advocacy<br />\nProgram at the East Baltimore campus.<br />\nAssociation has been solicited. Also,<br />\nbeing formed to ask for<br />\nplans are<br />\ndonations from private physicians in the<br />\nBaltimore area.<br />\nRather than close CHAP, a merger<br />\nwith another agency is being discussed.<br />\nOne possibility is The People's Clinic,<br />\nan organization sponsored by the Black<br />\nPanthers and Baltimore Defense Committee (BDC).<br />\nThe People's Clinic is designed to<br />\nserve both white and black residents of<br />\nWest Baltimore, The Panthers and BDC<br />\nclaim they are trying to fill the gap<br />\nbetween patient needs and the services<br />\nbeing provided.<br />\nTo eliminate the \"indifference to the<br />\nreal human needs of the individual,\"<br /><br />\nthe People's Clinic will serve not only<br />\nthe patient's medical needs, but housing,<br />\nnutritional, and other social needs as<br />\nwell. The clinic will be open on a 24<br />\nhour basis in order to give patients<br />\nthe opportunity to receive care without<br />\nforf eiting working hours.<br />\nThe clinic's organizers have asked for<br />\ndonations in order to initiate action. A<br />\nbuilding in the Franklin Square area of<br />\nWest Baltimore has been selected but<br />\nmoney is not available for rent payments.<br />\nMedical equipment, supplies, drugs and<br />\nstaff are still needed.<br />\nA Community Information Center is<br />\nplanned to operate out of the People's<br />\nClinic to provide legal aid, birth control<br />\nand abortion counselling, housing aid<br />\nand pre-natal advise.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nB and M Held Up<br />\nThree armed robbers entered the B and M Subshop,<br />\nrifled the cash register and robbed five customers of<br />\nover $100 last Saturday night.<br />\nAs the men were leaving one was frightened by a noise<br />\nfrom one of the freezers (the one with ice-cream in it)<br />\nand fired his gun at the younger Joe Bataglia, but the<br />\nweapon mis-fired and no injury was incurred.<br />\nAccording to Joe, two of the men entered the shop at<br />\nabout 10:30 p.m. and looked around before going outside.<br />\nThey came back about an hour later with another man,<br />\nforced all the customers into the back room and made<br />\nJoe and Salina stand behind the meat counter.<br />\nJoe said that when he called in the robbery to the police, he was still talking to the receptionist as officers<br />\narrived on the scene. He also claimed that the heist was<br />\nvery well planned with one man standing by the door and<br />\nanother holding a gun on those in the store. The third<br />\ntook the money.<br />\nAccording to an News Letter editor, Joe makes \"the<br />\nbest meat-ball sub in the world.\" Another claims that<br />\nhe is the \"finest sub maker in the business.\"<br /><br />\nGuns, No Butter<br />\nRed China has begun an austerity drive designed to<br />\nheighten military preparedness and, at the same time,<br />\nimprove her economic condition.<br />\nUsing the threat of war with the Soviet Union, which<br />\nis believed to be causing genuine concern among authories, Chinese leaders are trying to unite the people in<br />\ntheir goal to conserve resources. Many analysts feel that<br />\nthe main purpose of the drive is to strengthen the economy<br />\nwhich has suffered from corruption and black-market<br />\nactivities. Reduced consumption of coal, petroleum and<br />\nelectricity has already been achieved, according to<br />\nreports.<br />\nThe reluctance to allow steel and tungsten ore to<br />\nleave the country has had an effect on world prices. The<br />\nstockpiling of grain and other resources by localities is<br />\nbeing urged by Peking officials to create self-sufficient<br />\nareas which could play vital, strategic roles in cases of<br />\nforeign invasion.<br />\nThe leader in the economy drive has been the army.<br />\nBy saving on building materials and fuel, and by innovating frugal practices like sterilizing used bandages for<br />\nfurther use, the army has not only set an example to the<br />\n700,000,000 Chinese but it has cut expenses by 6%.<br /><br />\nSpiro the Hero<br />\nIt seems that America's emerging hero, according to<br />\nTime Magazine, is Spiro Agnew.<br />\nThe man who bumbled his way through the 1968 campaign and was then the laughing stock of the nation has<br />\nnow assumed the role of world statesman and spokesman<br />\nfor middle America. It is no wonder that jokes have begun<br />\nto circulate about Agnew's dropping Nixon from the 1972<br />\nticket and that bumper stickers and posters glorifying<br />\nthe Vice President are popping up all over the nation.<br />\nHe is a top attraction for speaking engagements, and,<br />\njust recently, he was accorded the honor in the Gallup<br />\nPoll of being rated as the third most admired man in<br />\nAmerica. There is little doubt that the man who spoke<br />\nout against the news media and protesters reflects the<br />\nattitude of a vast segment of the population.<br />\nRepublican Party leaders view Agnew as their secret<br />\nweapon in the fall elections and see their chances of<br />\ngaining control of Congress enhanced by his presence on<br />\nthe campaign trail. If one finds all this hard to believe,<br />\nthe ivory tower complex and association with \"effete<br />\nsnobs\" may well account for it.<br /><br />\n'No Knock' Passes<br />\nA statute permitting federal agents to enter a home<br />\nwithout warning or identification if they believe narcotics<br />\nwould be destroyed inside has been passed by the Senate.<br />\nThe 70 to 15 vote on Tuesday followed a three day<br />\ndebate on the provision which will be added to the omnibus<br />\ndrug bill being prepared. Under the new statute, agents<br />\nsuspecting the probable destruction of narcotics by parties trying to escape arrest are entitled to a \"no-knock\"<br />\nwarrent by a judge.<br />\nIn addition to giving agents power to break into a home,<br />\nit also could be used in raids on offices of doctors under<br />\nsuspicion of illicit possession of narcotics. Michigan<br />\nSenator Griffin pointed out that 29 states have similar<br />\nprovisions and that there is no danger of unconstitutionality.<br />\nIowa Senator, Howard Hughes introduced one amendment to require the HEW Secretary's opinion before the<br />\nAttorney-General could classify a drug and another to<br />\ncut penalties for possession and distribution of marijuana.<br />\nPerhaps the general attitude in the Senate was expressed by Senator Dodd who warned that \"the hoodlums and<br />\ndope peddlers are watching us\" to see \"if we mean<br />\nbusiness.\"<br /><br />\nS.C. Leaves South<br />\nA significant development in the growth of New South<br />\nappeared this week when South Carolina Governor Robert<br />\nMcNair vowed compliance with the Supreme Court's<br />\nruling on immediate desegregation of public schools<br />\nBy so doing, he broke ranks with other Southern Gover'<br />\nnors, such as Florida's Kirk, who have been largelY<br />\nuncooperative with the order.<br />\nClaiming that \"we must adjust to new circumstances,\"<br />\nMcNair promised to oppose attempts by parents to close<br />\ndown schools rather than desegregate. Citing the examples of Little Rock, Mississippi and Alabama, the<br />\nGovernor said that they have seen what defiance of the<br />\nlawful record of which they are proud.<br />\nIn a half-hour speech to his constituents, McNair was<br />\nmost adament in his refusal to compromise the qualitY<br />\nof the educational system. \"We don't want to bring UP<br />\nanother generation of illiterates.\"<br /><br />\nHEW Veto Sustained<br />\nSustaining President Nixon's veto of the Congressional<br />\nincrease of $1.1 billion in the health, education and anti'<br />\npoverty appropriations bill, the House of Representatives<br />\nWednesday offered proof of Nixon's political strength.<br />\nNixon weilded his power for the first time last MondaYr<br />\nby vetoing a $1 billion appropriation for Health, Education and Welfare.<br />\nClaiming that the government's estimated $198 billion<br />\ndollar budget was already $5.1 billion more than his<br />\noriginal budget of last April, the President denounced<br />\nthe \"controllable increase\" in the health, education, and<br />\nanti-poverty measure as \"untimely, misdirected, and<br />\ninflationary.\"<br />\nThe measure was to have provided operation funds for<br />\nthe Department of Labor, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Office of Economic Opportunity.<br />\nCongress now must decide whether to produce a neW<br />\nappropriations bill or authorize continued spending on<br />\nthe organizations at the current rate.<br />\nNixon rationalized the veto by arguing that he could<br />\nnot let pass a measure, however worthy its objectives,<br />\nthat threatened his anti-inflationary efforts and \"failed<br />\nto target the scarce resour es of the Federal Government in ways I can accept in this period of budget<br />\nstringency.\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40377, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "82f71ad8-3d1c-4934-8535-be31e4f53581", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14001-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14001, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "b920fc35-8b7c-4977-bc15-2ef2566ea344", "url": "/node/14001"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "8d4243b9-a34f-44d4-a4d6-cb272caef5eb"}]}
