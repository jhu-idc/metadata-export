The ACP is a plan not only simply<br />\nbrilliant, but also brilliantly simple. All it is, is a loose regional<br />\nfederation of small colleges. Let's say, for example, that in a<br />\ngiven region we have a group of small colleges, each with its<br />\nown academic specialty. Small College No. 1, let's say,has a fine<br />\nlanguage department; Small College No. 2, let's say, has a fine<br />\nscience department; No.3 has a fine music department; etc., etc.<br />\nWell sir, under the ACP these various colleges federate. A<br />\nstudent in any one of the colleges can take courses in the specialty of any of the other colleges and\u2014here's the beauty part!<br />\n\u2014he will receive credit for the course at his home college. Thus<br />\nhe enjoys all the advantages of a big university without losing<br />\nthe comfy coziness of a small college!<br />\nWell sir, you can see what a good idea the ACP is. I respectfully submit, however, that just because a thing is good is no<br />\nreason not to try to make it better. Like,for instance, Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes. Marlboros were good from the very beginning, and<br />\npeople found out quickly and sales zoomed. But did the makers<br />\nof Marlboro say, \"Okay, we've got it made. Let's relax\"?<br />\nWell sir, if that's what you think, you don't know the makers!<br />\nThey did not relax. They took their good Marlboros and kept<br />\nimproving them. They improved the filter, improved the blend,<br />\nimproved the pack. They researched and developed tirelessly,<br />\nuntil today Marlboro is just about the most admirable cigarette<br />\nyou can put a match to. There are, in fact, some people who<br />\nfind Marlboros so admirable they can't bear to put a match to<br />\nthem. They just sit with a single Marlboro in hand and admire<br />\nit for ten, twelve years on end. The makers of Marlboro are of<br />\ncourse deeply touched by this\u2014except for E. Rennie Sigafoos,<br />\nthe sales manager.<br />\nBut I digress. The ACP, I say, is good but it can be better.<br />\nWhy should the plan be confined to small colleges? Why should<br />\nit be confined to a limited region? Why not include all colleges<br />\nand universities, big and small, wherever they are?<br />\nLet's start such a federation.

Let<br />\nus discuss it like gentlemen, for<br />\nI am not convinced either way.<br />\nProtus, Meno says that the provisions of the Code were rushed<br />\nthrough the Board of Governors.<br />\nCan this be so?<br />\nPROTUS: Nay, Anytus.

Does<br />\nthis not prevent mere strivers for<br />\nsuperiority from becoming governors? Surely such men would<br />\nnot be elected by their peers.<br />\nPROTUS: Indeed you are correct, Anytus. Furthermore, the<br />\nBoard of Governors is actually<br />\nlosing powers which they previously had; for in creating the<br />\nCode and the Commission to administrate it. they are giving up<br />\ntheir own judicial functions. This<br />\nis desirable for two reasons. First,<br />\nthe legislative and judicial<br />\nbranches of a government ought<br />\nto be separated.

In this way the<br />\nBoard, which is committed to<br />\nrepresent the best interests of<br />\nall the scholars, can closely watch<br />\nthe Code Commission, and keep<br />\nit from getting out of line, or<br />\nfrom getting too powerful.

They<br />\nseem quite jealous to protect the<br />\ninterests of the scholars living<br />\nin the Chambers, and rightly affirm that the Code Commission<br />\nwould not understand the particular problems occuring in the<br />\nChambers. They also think that<br />\nthey may be forced to give up the<br />\nJudicial Council which they only<br />\nrecently created.<br />\nANYTUS: There are those who<br />\nwould contest your former point,<br />\nMeno, for I understand that at<br />\nleast six Chamber scholars must<br />\nbe included on the Code Commission, and at least three must<br />\nsit on the Trial Committee when<br />\na Chamber scholar is being tried.<br />\nYour latter point I know nothing<br />\nabout.<br />\nPROTUS: I am informed on<br />\nthis matter, Anytus, and a difficult one it is. For in the first<br />\nplace, the fact is that the Ministers of the Living Chambers<br />\nwould retain their Judicial Council under the present Code Commission Constitution. But since<br />\nthe Constitution also specifically<br />\nstates that the Code Commission<br />\nwould handle cases involving<br />\nrioting among the scholars, the<br />\nmain functions of the Judicial<br />\nCouncil would be taken away,<br />\nleaving it with only the handling<br />\nof minor problems. Some of the<br />\nMinisters feel that the Judicial<br />\nCouncil should have full powers<br />\nin its own territory \u2014 but this<br />\nwould include riot jurisdiction.<br />\nOthers, however, would rather<br />\nturn all judicial functions of the<br />\nMinisters of the Living Chambers<br />\nover to the Code Commission.<br />\nHowever, this would bring an<br />\nend to the Judicial Council.<br />\nANYTUS: Some have said that<br />\nwhile the newly formed Judicial<br />\nCouncil is constitutionally constructed in quite a fine fashion,<br />\nthere can be little doubt that the<br />\nCode Commission is better constructed. And they affirm this<br />\nbecause it is constructed in a<br />\nway that is almost identical with<br />\nthat of the Academic Honor<br />\nCouncil, which has stood the test<br />\nof time.<br />\nMENO: I see, Anytus, that you<br />\nare beginning to realize one of<br />\nthe greatest negative points<br />\nabout the Code Commission. That<br />\npoint is its relation to the Ministers of the Living Chambers and<br />\ntheir Judicial Council. Indeed,<br />\nthe original purpose in forming<br />\nthe Code Commission was to unify all judicial functions at the<br />\nAcademy into one unit, thereby<br />\neliminating hazy boundaries of<br />\njurisdiction and also regularizing<br />\npunishments given for like misdemeanors. But, Anytus and<br />\nProlus, this purpose has not<br />\nbeen accomplished, and will not<br />\nbe accomplished until the Judicial Council is done away with.<br />\nANYTUS: Your argument is an<br />\nexcellent one, Meno. Perhaps you<br />\nmay convince me even more if<br />\nyou will comment on item D<br />\nunder section number one of the<br />\nCode Commission Constitution.<br />\nMENO: You refer to the omnibus clause which gives the Board<br />\nof Governors the right to declare<br />\nany action a violation of the<br />\nnon-academic code of living<br />\nstandards. This is a fine example<br />\nof the governors' grasping for<br />\npower.<br />\nPROTUS: I cannot deny the<br />\nexistence of this clause, yet close<br />\nexamination will reveal that it<br />\nis not so bad after all.

I mean, you go to<br />\nany campus in the country these days and you will see students<br />\nand faculty dancing on the green, blowing penny whistles,<br />\ngrabbing each other by the elbows and yelling, \"About that<br />\nACP, Charley\u2014like wow!\"<br />\nAnd who can blame them? The ACP is a plan not only simply<br />\nbrilliant, but also brilliantly simple. All it is, is a loose regional<br />\nfederation of small colleges. Let's say, for example, that in a<br />\ngiven region we have a group of small colleges, each with its<br />\nown academic specialty. Small College No. 1, let's say,has a fine<br />\nlanguage department; Small College No. 2, let's say, has a fine<br />\nscience department; No.3 has a fine music department; etc., etc.<br />\nWell sir, under the ACP these various colleges federate. A<br />\nstudent in any one of the colleges can take courses in the specialty of any of the other colleges and\u2014here's the beauty part!<br />\n\u2014he will receive credit for the course at his home college. Thus<br />\nhe enjoys all the advantages of a big university without losing<br />\nthe comfy coziness of a small college!<br />\nWell sir, you can see what a good idea the ACP is. I respectfully submit, however, that just because a thing is good is no<br />\nreason not to try to make it better. Like,for instance, Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes. Marlboros were good from the very beginning, and<br />\npeople found out quickly and sales zoomed. But did the makers<br />\nof Marlboro say, \"Okay, we've got it made. Let's relax\"?<br />\nWell sir, if that's what you think, you don't know the makers!<br />\nThey did not relax. They took their good Marlboros and kept<br />\nimproving them. They improved the filter, improved the blend,<br />\nimproved the pack. They researched and developed tirelessly,<br />\nuntil today Marlboro is just about the most admirable cigarette<br />\nyou can put a match to. There are, in fact, some people who<br />\nfind Marlboros so admirable they can't bear to put a match to<br />\nthem. They just sit with a single Marlboro in hand and admire<br />\nit for ten, twelve years on end. The makers of Marlboro are of<br />\ncourse deeply touched by this\u2014except for E. Rennie Sigafoos,<br />\nthe sales manager.<br />\nBut I digress. The ACP, I say, is good but it can be better.<br />\nWhy should the plan be confined to small colleges? Why should<br />\nit be confined to a limited region? Why not include all colleges<br />\nand universities, big and small, wherever they are?<br />\nLet's start such a federation.

Does<br />\nthis not prevent mere strivers for<br />\nsuperiority from becoming governors? Surely such men would<br />\nnot be elected by their peers.<br />\nPROTUS: Indeed you are correct, Anytus. Furthermore, the<br />\nBoard of Governors is actually<br />\nlosing powers which they previously had; for in creating the<br />\nCode and the Commission to administrate it. they are giving up<br />\ntheir own judicial functions. This<br />\nis desirable for two reasons. First,<br />\nthe legislative and judicial<br />\nbranches of a government ought<br />\nto be separated.

In this way the<br />\nBoard, which is committed to<br />\nrepresent the best interests of<br />\nall the scholars, can closely watch<br />\nthe Code Commission, and keep<br />\nit from getting out of line, or<br />\nfrom getting too powerful. This<br />\nmethod is superior to having the<br />\nDirector of the Code Commission<br />\nsit on the Board of Governors,<br />\nfor he could tell the Board only<br />\nwhat he wished it to know about<br />\nthe workings of the Code Commission.<br />\nMENO: Though I have my<br />\ndoubts about this point, I will<br />\npresent yet another which Protus<br />\nwill find more difficult to answer.<br /><br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nDaily 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.<br />\nMon., Thurs., Fri.

C.<br /><br />\nWINSTON TASTES GOOD like a cigarette should!<br /><br />\nThe Ministers of the Living<br />\nChambers recently set up a judicial Council of their own. They<br />\nseem quite jealous to protect the<br />\ninterests of the scholars living<br />\nin the Chambers, and rightly affirm that the Code Commission<br />\nwould not understand the particular problems occuring in the<br />\nChambers. They also think that<br />\nthey may be forced to give up the<br />\nJudicial Council which they only<br />\nrecently created.<br />\nANYTUS: There are those who<br />\nwould contest your former point,<br />\nMeno, for I understand that at<br />\nleast six Chamber scholars must<br />\nbe included on the Code Commission, and at least three must<br />\nsit on the Trial Committee when<br />\na Chamber scholar is being tried.<br />\nYour latter point I know nothing<br />\nabout.<br />\nPROTUS: I am informed on<br />\nthis matter, Anytus, and a difficult one it is. For in the first<br />\nplace, the fact is that the Ministers of the Living Chambers<br />\nwould retain their Judicial Council under the present Code Commission Constitution. But since<br />\nthe Constitution also specifically<br />\nstates that the Code Commission<br />\nwould handle cases involving<br />\nrioting among the scholars, the<br />\nmain functions of the Judicial<br />\nCouncil would be taken away,<br />\nleaving it with only the handling<br />\nof minor problems. Some of the<br />\nMinisters feel that the Judicial<br />\nCouncil should have full powers<br />\nin its own territory \u2014 but this<br />\nwould include riot jurisdiction.<br />\nOthers, however, would rather<br />\nturn all judicial functions of the<br />\nMinisters of the Living Chambers<br />\nover to the Code Commission.<br />\nHowever, this would bring an<br />\nend to the Judicial Council.<br />\nANYTUS: Some have said that<br />\nwhile the newly formed Judicial<br />\nCouncil is constitutionally constructed in quite a fine fashion,<br />\nthere can be little doubt that the<br />\nCode Commission is better constructed. And they affirm this<br />\nbecause it is constructed in a<br />\nway that is almost identical with<br />\nthat of the Academic Honor<br />\nCouncil, which has stood the test<br />\nof time.<br />\nMENO: I see, Anytus, that you<br />\nare beginning to realize one of<br />\nthe greatest negative points<br />\nabout the Code Commission. That<br />\npoint is its relation to the Ministers of the Living Chambers and<br />\ntheir Judicial Council. Indeed,<br />\nthe original purpose in forming<br />\nthe Code Commission was to unify all judicial functions at the<br />\nAcademy into one unit, thereby<br />\neliminating hazy boundaries of<br />\njurisdiction and also regularizing<br />\npunishments given for like misdemeanors. But, Anytus and<br />\nProlus, this purpose has not<br />\nbeen accomplished, and will not<br />\nbe accomplished until the Judicial Council is done away with.<br />\nANYTUS: Your argument is an<br />\nexcellent one, Meno. Perhaps you<br />\nmay convince me even more if<br />\nyou will comment on item D<br />\nunder section number one of the<br />\nCode Commission Constitution.<br />\nMENO: You refer to the omnibus clause which gives the Board<br />\nof Governors the right to declare<br />\nany action a violation of the<br />\nnon-academic code of living<br />\nstandards. This is a fine example<br />\nof the governors' grasping for<br />\npower.<br />\nPROTUS: I cannot deny the<br />\nexistence of this clause, yet close<br />\nexamination will reveal that it<br />\nis not so bad after all.
