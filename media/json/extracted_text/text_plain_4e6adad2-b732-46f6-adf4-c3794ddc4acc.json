Criticism is<br />\nvery good, but it should be given and<br />\nreceived in the proper spirit: and that<br />\nmeans constructively. There is usually little use in criticism which is<br />\ntotally destructive. The question that<br />\nmust be continually addressed to the<br />\ncritic is \"What is your solution?\"<br />\nFailing to answer this question usually shows the critic to be a rather<br />\nshallow thinker. Answering it usually helps to lead to a solution, since<br />\nthe answer is likewise open to criticism; and mutual criticism forces a<br />\ncomparison of values, which should<br />\nbring at least a tentative answer.<br />\nIt is to this purpose of searching<br />\nfor worthwhile conclusions that the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER has dedicated itself.

C. Lovejoy, professor of philosophy, has called attention to an error in an article printed in last Friday's NEWS-LETTER on the hearing on<br />\nTeachers' Oath Bill before Governor<br />\nNice. He said at that time, in answer<br />\nto the question of Governor Nice<br />\nwhether he would support a bill providing penalties for the teaching of<br />\npropaganda, that he believed that<br />\n\"The classroom is not the place for<br />\npropaganda, Republican, Democratic,<br />\nSocialist, Communist, or any other;<br />\nbut it is up to the separate institutions to decide this matter.\"<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER originally stated<br />\nthat he had said that he thought he<br />\nwould support such a bill. The paper<br />\nis sorry for this error.<br />\nDr. Lovejoy further clarified his<br />\nview with the following words, in<br />\nmaking this correction:<br />\n\"As for the right of the individual,<br />\nteacher or any other citizen, to advocate and agitate for any change in<br />\nour institutions which he may believe<br />\ndesirable; I recognize no limit to this<br />\nright, provided such agitation does<br />\nnot take the form of physical violence.<br />\nA fundamental principle of the Constitution is that it may be changed<br />\nat any time and to any extent in the<br />\nmanner provided in the Constitution<br />\nitself; and the first article of the Bill<br />\nof Rights in the Maryland Constitution asserts the inalienable right of<br />\nthe people to alter, reform or abolish<br />\ntheir form of Government in such<br />\nmanner as they may deem expedient.<br />\n<br />\nCHARLIE<br />\n<br />\n\"Upon that I take my stand.
