Editor after<br />\neditor has bequeathed to his successor the belief that graduates of Baltimore high schools head the list of failures at Hopkins. And there<br />\nhas always been a tradition existing that products of private schools<br />\nwere paragons of scholastic ability, and that but comparatively few of<br />\ntheir number were ever ejected by means of the automatic \"three-failure<br />\nroute.\"<br />\nIn a recent editorial the NEWS-LETTER stated that \"the greatest<br />\nnumber of failures . . . . occur among graduates of city high schools.<br />\nNext in line are entrants from county schools, while the least number<br />\nof failures are registered among men from private institutions.\"<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER desires to correct this assertion. Figures presented in President Goodnow's recent report demonstrate conclusively<br />\nthat the percentage of failures is lowest/among graduates of Baltimore<br />\nhigh schools.- Men from county high schools stand next, while the least<br />\nefficient students, from the point of view of scholastic achievement, are<br />\nthose from private institutions.

W. Pullen Gives Illustrated<br />\nLecture to Electrical Club in<br />\nM. E. Building<br />\n<br />\n\"The electrification of steam<br />\nrailroads has been proved by tests<br />\nmade by the Westinghouse Electric and other large electrical corporations to be both economical<br />\nand efficient,\" declared Professor<br />\nM. W. Pullen, in an illustrated address before the members of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Electrical Club.<br />\nMr. Pullen spoke on \"Steam Railroad Electrification\" at the regular<br />\nmeeting of the club, held last Friday, January 11, in the Mechanical Engineering Building.<br />\nElectric System's Advantages<br />\n<br />\nThe speaker recounted many advantages which the electric railway holds over its steam rival. In<br />\nthe first place, it will haul heavy<br />\n(loads over the steep grades of<br />\nmountainous districts at twice the<br />\nspeed, and much more efficiently,<br />\nespecially in cold weather. In<br />\nfact, the electric engine is actually<br />\nmore efficient in cold weather than<br />\nin warm. Secondly, the brake<br />\nmovements are not only at greater<br />\nspeed, but the braking System operates with more security, especially on down grades.<br />\nProfessor Pullen presented authoritative data from some of the<br />\nlargest railroad systems in the<br />\ncountry, which conclusively proved<br />\nthe economies which the installation of electric locomotives and<br />\ntrains brought about. According<br />\nto officers of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, their<br />\ncompany has saved $22,000 on new<br />\nbrake shoes alone since the system<br />\nwas electrified. Another instance<br />\nof saving was in their switching<br />\nsystem.

The<br />\nadvancing of knowledge in this<br />\nsubject was declared. by Dr. Zinsser to be of vital importance in<br />\npublic health work.<br />\nThe De Lamar Lectureship in<br />\nHygiene is one which has been<br />\ngiven annually at the School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health at<br />\nJohns Hopkins for some years.<br />\nDuring the present scholastic year<br />\nseveral authorities on public health<br />\nwork have been brought to Baltimore to address these meetings,<br />\nwhich are all public and do not<br />\nrequire cards of admission.<br />\nAERONAUTICAL ENGINEERS<br />\nNEEDED BY GOVERNMENT<br />\nDr. John B. Whitehead, dean of<br />\nthe Engineering School, has received notice from the United<br />\nStates Civil Service Commission<br />\nthat applications will now be received from graduates of recognized engineering- schools for positions as junior mechanical engineers.<br />\nMen selected will specialize in<br />\naeronautical work and, as construction in this field is continually expanding at present, they have<br />\nopportunty of rising to the rank of<br />\naeronautical engineer.

This locomotive, which is the<br />\nproperty of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, has six<br />\npairs of driving wheels, and develops 4.200 horse power at a<br />\nspeed of 65 miles an hour.

Editor after<br />\neditor has bequeathed to his successor the belief that graduates of Baltimore high schools head the list of failures at Hopkins. And there<br />\nhas always been a tradition existing that products of private schools<br />\nwere paragons of scholastic ability, and that but comparatively few of<br />\ntheir number were ever ejected by means of the automatic \"three-failure<br />\nroute.\"<br />\nIn a recent editorial the NEWS-LETTER stated that \"the greatest<br />\nnumber of failures . . . . occur among graduates of city high schools.<br />\nNext in line are entrants from county schools, while the least number<br />\nof failures are registered among men from private institutions.\"<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER desires to correct this assertion. Figures presented in President Goodnow's recent report demonstrate conclusively<br />\nthat the percentage of failures is lowest/among graduates of Baltimore<br />\nhigh schools.- Men from county high schools stand next, while the least<br />\nefficient students, from the point of view of scholastic achievement, are<br />\nthose from private institutions.

W. Pullen Gives Illustrated<br />\nLecture to Electrical Club in<br />\nM. E. Building<br /><br />\n\"The electrification of steam<br />\nrailroads has been proved by tests<br />\nmade by the Westinghouse Electric and other large electrical corporations to be both economical<br />\nand efficient,\" declared Professor<br />\nM. W. Pullen, in an illustrated address before the members of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Electrical Club.<br />\nMr. Pullen spoke on \"Steam Railroad Electrification\" at the regular<br />\nmeeting of the club, held last Friday, January 11, in the Mechanical Engineering Building.<br />\nElectric System's Advantages<br /><br />\nThe speaker recounted many advantages which the electric railway holds over its steam rival. In<br />\nthe first place, it will haul heavy<br />\n(loads over the steep grades of<br />\nmountainous districts at twice the<br />\nspeed, and much more efficiently,<br />\nespecially in cold weather. In<br />\nfact, the electric engine is actually<br />\nmore efficient in cold weather than<br />\nin warm. Secondly, the brake<br />\nmovements are not only at greater<br />\nspeed, but the braking System operates with more security, especially on down grades.<br />\nProfessor Pullen presented authoritative data from some of the<br />\nlargest railroad systems in the<br />\ncountry, which conclusively proved<br />\nthe economies which the installation of electric locomotives and<br />\ntrains brought about. According<br />\nto officers of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, their<br />\ncompany has saved $22,000 on new<br />\nbrake shoes alone since the system<br />\nwas electrified. Another instance<br />\nof saving was in their switching<br />\nsystem. In this department six<br />\nelectric locomotives easily do the<br />\nwork that formerly required ten<br />\nsteam locomotives.<br />\nMonster Electric Engine<br /><br />\nDr. Hans Zinsser, professor of<br />\nbacteriology at the Medical School<br />\nof the Harvard University, was<br />\nthe speaker at the fourth De Lamar Lecture in Hygiene, given at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and lublic Health, Dr.<br />\nZinsser, who is one of the foremost authorities on bacteriology<br />\nand allied subjects in the present<br />\nage, spoke on \"The Present State<br />\nof Knowledge of Hypersusceptibility.\"<br />\nThe Harvard professor told of<br />\nthe present limited knowledge in<br />\nthis important subject in the field<br />\nof hygiene, and recounted the<br />\nprogress which investigators are<br />\nnow making in research work. The<br />\nadvancing of knowledge in this<br />\nsubject was declared. by Dr. Zinsser to be of vital importance in<br />\npublic health work.<br />\nThe De Lamar Lectureship in<br />\nHygiene is one which has been<br />\ngiven annually at the School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health at<br />\nJohns Hopkins for some years.<br />\nDuring the present scholastic year<br />\nseveral authorities on public health<br />\nwork have been brought to Baltimore to address these meetings,<br />\nwhich are all public and do not<br />\nrequire cards of admission.<br />\nAERONAUTICAL ENGINEERS<br />\nNEEDED BY GOVERNMENT<br />\nDr. John B. Whitehead, dean of<br />\nthe Engineering School, has received notice from the United<br />\nStates Civil Service Commission<br />\nthat applications will now be received from graduates of recognized engineering- schools for positions as junior mechanical engineers.<br />\nMen selected will specialize in<br />\naeronautical work and, as construction in this field is continually expanding at present, they have<br />\nopportunty of rising to the rank of<br />\naeronautical engineer. The salary<br />\nwill be $7.20 per day to start. The<br />\nmajority of the engineers selected<br />\nwill be placed in the Engine Test<br />\nLaboratory, the Navy Yard,<br />\nWashington, D. C.<br />\nApplicants should apply immediately to the United States Civil<br />\nService Commission, Washington,<br />\nD. C., asking for Form 1312.<br /><br />\nThe speaker further gave interesting figures as to the size of the<br />\nlargest electric engine' in use today. This locomotive, which is the<br />\nproperty of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, has six<br />\npairs of driving wheels, and develops 4.200 horse power at a<br />\nspeed of 65 miles an hour. This<br />\nlocomotive is capable of pulling a<br />\ntrain of fourteen heavy steel cars<br />\nUp a two per cent grade.- It also<br />\nhas the regeneration system, where- POEM TO DR.
