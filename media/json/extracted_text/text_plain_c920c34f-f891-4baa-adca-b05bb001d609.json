Itisa peninsula, bounded<br />\nby the Bay on the east, the Patuxent River on the<br />\nwest, and on the north by Anne Arundel County.<br />\nThe surface is undulating, and drains from a central<br />\nelevation towards the bay and river, into which nu-<br />\nmerous little creeks empty.<br />\n<br />\nThe soil is a soft fine mould, except on the Patux-<br />\nent, where it is more clayey, and is well adapted to<br />\nthe growth of corn, tobacco, and wheat, though the<br />\ngreat staple is tobacco. The climate is generally<br />\nwarm and mild. The waters of the Chesapeake and<br />\nPatuxent abound in the finest fish and oysters; im-<br />\nmense quantities of the latter are annually carried to<br />\nBaltimore and the Northern markets; the trade em-<br />\nploying large numbers of men. Tripoli, which is<br />\nused as a polishing material, is found in many local-<br />\nities, the deposit on the Patuxent being very large.<br />\nMarl exists also, affording a good fertilizer in many<br />\nlocalities. Oak, Chestnut, Pine, and Locust are the<br />\nnatural timber growths, and mostly line the navi-<br />\ngable waters.<br />\n<br />\nCAROLINE COUNTY is of small area, and is<br />\nbounded on the east by the State of Delaware, north-<br />\nwest and west by Queen Anne\u2019s and Talbot, and<br />\nsouth\u2019by Dorchester counties.<br />\n<br />\nThe main branch of the Choptank River runs<br />\nthrough the county, and is navigated by steamboats<br />\nto Denton. This, with other crecks, afford excellent<br />\nfacilities for sending produce to market, and in re-<br />\nturn, obtaining lime, ashes, and manures; scarcely<br />\nany land lying more than five miles from navigable<br />\nwater.<br />\n<br />\nSome of its soils are sandy, some are low meadow-<br />\nlands of rich black earth, but the largest proportion<br />\nis a loam with a clay subsoil. The last will produce<br />\ngrains, grasses, vegetables, cotton, and tobacco, which<br />\nlatter two are raised in small quantities very success-<br />\nfully for domestic use. The sandy soil is very pro-<br />\nductive in sweet potatoes, and every variety of vege-<br />\ntables and fruits. Peaches are very largely cultivated<br />\nand sent to the city markets.<br />\n<br />\nThe general character of the county is level, but<br />\nsufficiently undulating to afford drainage, and the<br />\nroads are mostly level and hard, and give very fine<br />\ntravelling facilities.

The surface is mostly undulat-<br />\n<br />\ning, watered by fine streams, tributaries of the Pa-<br />\n<br />\ntapsco and Monocacy rivers, which flow from innu-<br />\nmerable springs of the purest water. Kxcellent<br />\nwater-power is afforded by these streams, which is<br />\nimproved by cotton and woollen factories, merchant<br />\nand paper-mills, and numerous saw and grist-mills.<br />\nThere are also a considerable number of tanneries,<br />\ninduced, no doubt, by the abundance of fine oak<br />\ntimber, which comprises the body of the natural<br />\ngrowth of wood.

From this ridge the Catoctin<br />\nMountains are plainly visible.<br />\n<br />\nThe soils are limestone, \u201c Red-lands,\u201d and slaty<br />\n<br />\nsoil, all mostly very fertile or easily improved, ren-<br />\n<br />\ndering it one of the finest agricultural counties of<br />\nMaryland.

Tobacco is still raised to some<br />\nextent in the lower part of the county, but is yearly<br />\n<br />\nless cultivated. The grazing is fine, and it ranks as .<br />\n<br />\na fine dairy county, producing a large share of the<br />\nbutter crop of the State. The Pipe Creek, Sam\u2019s<br />\nCreek, and Wakefield valleys are unexcelled for fer-<br />\ntility and fine farming.<br />\n<br />\nThe county possesses fine building material, a good<br />\nspecies of granite, and other stone.

Even the refuse<br />\nstone and dust are valuable in many ways.<br />\n<br />\nThe county has a fair share of good roads, and has<br />\ncommunication with Baltimore by means of an ex-<br />\ncellent turnpike, one branch of which runs to West-<br />\nminster, and the other to Manchester.

These shores also afford abundance of wild<br />\nfowl in the season.<br />\n<br />\nThe county enjoys excellent facilities for transpor-<br />\ntation. The Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Balti-<br />\nmore Railroad traverses the centre, and also the<br />\nChesapeake and Delaware Canal, and the Philadel-<br />\nphia Central Railroad crosses the north-western cor-<br />\nner of the county.

This town has a steamboat running to<br />\nHavre de Grace, and also a daily line to Baltimore<br />\nand Philadelphia.
