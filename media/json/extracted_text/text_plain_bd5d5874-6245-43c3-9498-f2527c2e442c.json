His<br />\nleadership in his field is challenged<br />\nonly by a fellow Southerner, C. Van<br />\nWoodward.<br />\nDonald said being brought up in<br />\nthe South has helped him in his<br />\nwork. \"I find it very difficult,\" he<br />\nremarked, \"when approaching a<br />\nsubject like the Civil War or slavery<br />\nto think in rather clear<br />\nmoralistic<br />\nterms, of good or bad, or of right or<br />\nwrong.<br />\n\"If you're brought<br />\nin a society<br />\nwhere you see arouna you inherited<br />\nPrejudices and animosities, you<br />\nrealize that nobody sat down and<br />\ncreated them, but that this was the<br />\norder of things into which you were<br />\nborn.<br />\nHow They Feel<br />\n\"I think that I can feel how<br />\nSoutherners felt at that time. You<br />\ndon't necessarily agree with them,<br />\nbut you see how it<br />\noccurs.\"<br />\nDonald attended Millsaps College<br />\nin<br />\nMississippi. At the small school,<br />\nDonald met a dynamic professor of<br />\nHistory and Reconstruction who<br />\n<br />\nsparked his interest in the subject.<br />\n\"He was so exciting, so disturbing<br />\nin this rather rural Mississippi area<br />\nthat all of us young men clustered<br />\naround him,\" Donald related.<br />\nSouthern history became his<br />\nspecialty largely because of his<br />\norigins. \"For a Mississippian, the<br />\nSouth, and how it got to be the South<br />\nand why it continues to be the South-these are obsessive questions,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n<br />\n\"I have no need of<br />\nfinding my identity<br />\nin Southern past.\"<br />\nDr. Donald did his graduate work<br />\nat the University of Illinois, where<br />\nhe studied under the Lincoln expert<br />\nJ. G.

But it happened here in the case of Education.<br />\nThere has been considerable debate at Hopkins over<br />\nthe years on whether or not the Education Department<br />\nmade a sufficient contribution to the academic community to warrant its maintenance. But the resolution of<br />\nthat debate was not the factor that led to the department's demise.<br />\nIn fact, Dr. John Walton, a senior professor in<br />\nEducation, convinced the Academic Council several<br />\nyears back to import a chairman--Timothy Smith--to<br />\ngive the department new life. Allegations against Dr.<br />\nSmith's conduct as chairman are now worthless history.<br />\nThe Education Department is going and it is highly<br />\ndoubtful anything can be done at this stage to save it.<br />\nThe question we should all consider is why the<br />\nsituation was allowed to get so far out of hand that the<br />\nAcademic Council felt there was nothing to be done,<br />\nsave abolish what we consider a vital department.<br />\nThe answer is unchecked departmental autonomy.<br />\nImportant academic decisions at Hopkins are made at<br />\nthe departmental level, and each faculty member seems<br />\nto be so interested in preserving his own and department's freedom that he is willing to turn his back on<br />\nanother department's troubles until the very magnitude<br />\nof those troubles spills over into his daily life.<br />\nThis is what happened with Education. The internal<br />\nsquabbling that wracked the department could be, and<br />\nwas, ignored for many years.

The Southwest is comprised of the<br />\nBolton Hill restoration area and the Mount<br />\nVernon section of town. The Northeast and<br />\nthe Southeast are the last strongholds of the<br />\nwhite ethnic communities which once<br />\ncomprised a majority of the district. The<br />\nremainder of the district, that is the central<br />\nand Eastern portions, is primarily black.<br />\nThe district is very rich, very poor and<br />\nvery average. It has a disporportionately<br />\nlarge share of vacant and boarded-up<br />\nhouses.<br />\nCharles Village, near Hopkins, and other<br />\ncommunities are being pressed by unchecked expansion of narcotics traffic from<br />\nthe Greenmount Avenue areas. Drug use is<br />\non the increase in East Baltimore,<br />\nRemington and the Belair Road sections of<br />\nthe district.

It will be designed primarily to<br />\nhelp the suburbanites get in and out of the<br />\ncity.<br />\nEverywhere you go in the district there is<br />\nYet<br />\ndespair, anger and frustration.<br />\nsomething new and different is happening<br />\nin Baltimore City's Second District. Today,<br />\nas you are reading this, the voters in the<br />\nSecond District are electing Democratic<br />\nnominees to represent them in the General<br />\nAssembly.<br />\nThe Second District's voters will nominate<br />\ntwo State Senators and eight members of the<br />\nHouse of Delegates. In Baltimore City the<br />\nmain race is for the Democratic nomination,<br />\nfor the entire city traditionally sends only<br />\nDemocrats to serve in the General<br />\nAssembly.<br />\nRunning for the Democratic nomination in<br />\nthe Second district this year are eight candidates for the two Senate seats, an thirtyfive for the eight House seats. In this many<br />\nand varied field, one team of candidates<br />\nstands out far above the rest. Over a year<br />\nago, two \"amateur\" Democratic clubs got<br />\ntogether and decided to field a group of<br />\nhighly qualified candidates in the 1970<br />\nprimary. The oldest of the two clubs, the<br />\nEastside Democratic Organization (EDO)is<br />\nA<br />\nslightly over three years old.<br />\npredominately black club, it had its political<br />\nbaptism in 1967 when it elected Robert<br />\nDouglass to the City Council.

In addition, they would<br />\nalso split the slate for the eight seats on the<br />\ndistrict's Democratic State Central Committee.<br />\nIn the course of the next few months the<br />\n<br />\nCLARKE/ DALTON team was born. It is a<br />\nteam of young and old, white and black,<br />\nunited to bring to the Second District and to<br />\nBaltimore City the type of grassroots participation that is truly involved and accessible. It is a team composed of doctors<br />\nconcerned about the city's health care<br />\nprograms, lawyers concerned about the<br />\ncourts and judicial system, teachers,<br />\nbusinessmen and scientists, all actively<br />\ninvoled in their communities and dedicated<br />\nto finding better ways to serve the people<br />\nproblems.<br />\ncity's<br />\nand<br />\nthe<br />\nsolve<br />\nThe team is headed by J.

He has reason to be proud,<br />\nfor it has been widely<br />\npraised by such experts as J.<br />\nEdgar Hoover and John Mitchell.<br />\nThe windows in the building are equipped with<br />\n.Sliding steel panels which<br />\ncan become narrow slits<br />\nIn case of emergency. If the university is forced to<br />\nrespond to vicious tactics like cursing and namecalling, the slits can be used for a Mexican-style<br />\nappreach to dissent--namely, machine-guns.<br />\n\"God forbid we should ever have to use them,\"<br />\nremarks one liberal administrator,\"but it's nice to<br />\nknow they're<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nThe tastefully designed moat surrounding the<br />\nbuilding is an added precaution. Some disgruntled<br />\ncritics have charged that the use of a draw-bridge,<br />\ncoupled with special passes and police searches,<br />\nwill discourage<br />\nstudents from entering the<br />\nbuilding. But Speer responds, \"Any clean-cut kid<br />\nWith a good reason<br />\nto be in there should have<br />\nnothing to worry<br />\nabout.\"<br />\nFancy Office<br />\nThe office of the<br />\nnew dean, George Benton, will<br />\nProbably be the most sumptuous office in the<br />\nmassive structure.

The study further noted that Dr.<br />\nGordon would benefit by a crash-course on student<br />\nculture. \"In orded to relate to youth--and blunt<br />\nprotestes--Dr. Gordon would do well to learn<br />\nstudent slang and listen to rock music.\"<br />\nThe report presents a number of sample<br />\nresponses to different types of student actions.

With<br />\nthe huge salaries brought by television has<br />\ntelevision also bought control?<br />\nIn 1960, a group of businessmen, sensing<br />\nthe success of the 40-year-old National<br />\nFootball League, tried to fit the pieces of<br />\nsuccess together and organize a league of<br />\ntheir own. Learning from the death of the old<br />\nAmerican Association (whose sole surviving<br />\nteam was the Baltimore Colts), they felt they<br />\ncould make it.<br />\nThe original teams included the Dallas<br />\nTexans (now Kansas City Chiefs) and the<br />\nNew York Titans (now the New York Jets).<br />\nThe early years were lean. Sometimes the<br />\nteams found themselves playing to crowds of<br />\none hundred or less.<br />\nThen, college players the magnitude of Joe<br />\nNamath and a NBC television contract<br />\nstarted them on the road to the big money<br />\nera of Professional football.<br />\nIn 1966, the two leagues met and decided to<br />\neliminate cutthroat measures of competition. It was not until the league meetings<br />\nof 1970, that it was decided to have a complete merger.<br />\nAs a result, the ten-team American<br />\nFootball League was bolstered by the addition<br />\nof Baltimore, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, and renamed the American Conference.<br />\nThere was a decision to sell NBC the<br />\nFALL<br />\nFOOTBALL<br />\nSat., Sep. 26 Muhlenberg 1:30 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\nSat., Oct. 3 F & M 2:00 p.m. (H)<br />\nSat., Oct. 10 Ursinus 2:00 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\nSat., Oct. 17 Haverford 2:00 p.m.(H)<br />\nSat., Oct. 24 Hampden Sydney 2:00<br />\n<br />\np.m. (H)<br />\n<br />\nphotos by peter caloger<br />\n<br />\nSecond-string goalie Steve Buescher ma' kes a itzve<br />\n<br />\nSat., Oct. 31 Towson State 2:00 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\nSat., Nov.7 Swarthmore 1:30 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\nSat., Nov. 14 Dickinson 2:00 p.m.(H)<br />\nSat., Nov. 21 Western Md. 1:30 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\n<br />\nAmerican Conference games and CBS the<br />\nNational Conference games.

When Football Commissioner<br />\nPete Rozelle went to ABC with a list of the<br />\nMonday night games available, there was a<br />\ngame listed for Monday, September 28<br />\nbetween the Colts and Chiefs at Memorial<br />\nStadium.<br />\nThe problem that now rests in the hands of<br />\na Baltimore judge is whether or not the Colts<br />\nshould be allowed to use the stadium. There<br />\nis a clause in the contracts signed by both the<br />\nColts and Orioles that states there shall be no<br />\nfootball games within forty-eight hours<br />\nbefore a scheduled baseball game.<br />\nThe last time this type of controversy<br />\narose was between the Washington Redskins<br />\nand the Washington Senators over the use of<br />\nKennedy Stadium. The Redskins won their<br />\ncourt battle and played, but as a result of<br />\nrain the day before, the field was put in an<br />\nalmost unusable condition for the rest of the<br />\nbaseball season.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that Commissioner<br />\nRozelle has the power to decide where and<br />\nwhen football games should be played.

But it happened here in the case of Education.<br />\nThere has been considerable debate at Hopkins over<br />\nthe years on whether or not the Education Department<br />\nmade a sufficient contribution to the academic community to warrant its maintenance. But the resolution of<br />\nthat debate was not the factor that led to the department's demise.<br />\nIn fact, Dr. John Walton, a senior professor in<br />\nEducation, convinced the Academic Council several<br />\nyears back to import a chairman--Timothy Smith--to<br />\ngive the department new life. Allegations against Dr.<br />\nSmith's conduct as chairman are now worthless history.<br />\nThe Education Department is going and it is highly<br />\ndoubtful anything can be done at this stage to save it.<br />\nThe question we should all consider is why the<br />\nsituation was allowed to get so far out of hand that the<br />\nAcademic Council felt there was nothing to be done,<br />\nsave abolish what we consider a vital department.<br />\nThe answer is unchecked departmental autonomy.<br />\nImportant academic decisions at Hopkins are made at<br />\nthe departmental level, and each faculty member seems<br />\nto be so interested in preserving his own and department's freedom that he is willing to turn his back on<br />\nanother department's troubles until the very magnitude<br />\nof those troubles spills over into his daily life.<br />\nThis is what happened with Education.

The Southwest is comprised of the<br />\nBolton Hill restoration area and the Mount<br />\nVernon section of town. The Northeast and<br />\nthe Southeast are the last strongholds of the<br />\nwhite ethnic communities which once<br />\ncomprised a majority of the district. The<br />\nremainder of the district, that is the central<br />\nand Eastern portions, is primarily black.<br />\nThe district is very rich, very poor and<br />\nvery average. It has a disporportionately<br />\nlarge share of vacant and boarded-up<br />\nhouses.<br />\nCharles Village, near Hopkins, and other<br />\ncommunities are being pressed by unchecked expansion of narcotics traffic from<br />\nthe Greenmount Avenue areas. Drug use is<br />\non the increase in East Baltimore,<br />\nRemington and the Belair Road sections of<br />\nthe district.

The proposed subway will not<br />\nserve the majority of the people who live in<br />\nthe district. It will be designed primarily to<br />\nhelp the suburbanites get in and out of the<br />\ncity.<br />\nEverywhere you go in the district there is<br />\nYet<br />\ndespair, anger and frustration.<br />\nsomething new and different is happening<br />\nin Baltimore City's Second District. Today,<br />\nas you are reading this, the voters in the<br />\nSecond District are electing Democratic<br />\nnominees to represent them in the General<br />\nAssembly.<br />\nThe Second District's voters will nominate<br />\ntwo State Senators and eight members of the<br />\nHouse of Delegates. In Baltimore City the<br />\nmain race is for the Democratic nomination,<br />\nfor the entire city traditionally sends only<br />\nDemocrats to serve in the General<br />\nAssembly.<br />\nRunning for the Democratic nomination in<br />\nthe Second district this year are eight candidates for the two Senate seats, an thirtyfive for the eight House seats. In this many<br />\nand varied field, one team of candidates<br />\nstands out far above the rest. Over a year<br />\nago, two \"amateur\" Democratic clubs got<br />\ntogether and decided to field a group of<br />\nhighly qualified candidates in the 1970<br />\nprimary. The oldest of the two clubs, the<br />\nEastside Democratic Organization (EDO)is<br />\nA<br />\nslightly over three years old.<br />\npredominately black club, it had its political<br />\nbaptism in 1967 when it elected Robert<br />\nDouglass to the City Council.

In addition, they would<br />\nalso split the slate for the eight seats on the<br />\ndistrict's Democratic State Central Committee.<br />\nIn the course of the next few months the<br /><br />\nCLARKE/ DALTON team was born. It is a<br />\nteam of young and old, white and black,<br />\nunited to bring to the Second District and to<br />\nBaltimore City the type of grassroots participation that is truly involved and accessible. It is a team composed of doctors<br />\nconcerned about the city's health care<br />\nprograms, lawyers concerned about the<br />\ncourts and judicial system, teachers,<br />\nbusinessmen and scientists, all actively<br />\ninvoled in their communities and dedicated<br />\nto finding better ways to serve the people<br />\nproblems.<br />\ncity's<br />\nand<br />\nthe<br />\nsolve<br />\nThe team is headed by J.

Bob Dalton is a leader in many<br />\nEast Baltimore community organizations.<br />\nHe is a responisible labor leader and a board<br />\nmember of the East Baltimore Development<br />\nCorporation.<br />\nThe Team's House candidates are: Floyd<br />\nAdams, an incumbent - a fighting conservationist, businessman and leader of the<br />\nNortheastern Police Community Council.<br />\nDr. Torrey Brown, the Director of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital alcoholism and drug abuse<br />\nprograms, and a leader in the fight to<br />\nprovide East Baltimore with community<br />\nhealth services.

He has reason to be proud,<br />\nfor it has been widely<br />\npraised by such experts as J.<br />\nEdgar Hoover and John Mitchell.<br />\nThe windows in the building are equipped with<br />\n.Sliding steel panels which<br />\ncan become narrow slits<br />\nIn case of emergency. If the university is forced to<br />\nrespond to vicious tactics like cursing and namecalling, the slits can be used for a Mexican-style<br />\nappreach to dissent--namely, machine-guns.<br />\n\"God forbid we should ever have to use them,\"<br />\nremarks one liberal administrator,\"but it's nice to<br />\nknow they're<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nThe tastefully designed moat surrounding the<br />\nbuilding is an added precaution. Some disgruntled<br />\ncritics have charged that the use of a draw-bridge,<br />\ncoupled with special passes and police searches,<br />\nwill discourage<br />\nstudents from entering the<br />\nbuilding.

The study further noted that Dr.<br />\nGordon would benefit by a crash-course on student<br />\nculture. \"In orded to relate to youth--and blunt<br />\nprotestes--Dr. Gordon would do well to learn<br />\nstudent slang and listen to rock music.\"<br />\nThe report presents a number of sample<br />\nresponses to different types of student actions.

With<br />\nthe huge salaries brought by television has<br />\ntelevision also bought control?<br />\nIn 1960, a group of businessmen, sensing<br />\nthe success of the 40-year-old National<br />\nFootball League, tried to fit the pieces of<br />\nsuccess together and organize a league of<br />\ntheir own. Learning from the death of the old<br />\nAmerican Association (whose sole surviving<br />\nteam was the Baltimore Colts), they felt they<br />\ncould make it.<br />\nThe original teams included the Dallas<br />\nTexans (now Kansas City Chiefs) and the<br />\nNew York Titans (now the New York Jets).<br />\nThe early years were lean. Sometimes the<br />\nteams found themselves playing to crowds of<br />\none hundred or less.<br />\nThen, college players the magnitude of Joe<br />\nNamath and a NBC television contract<br />\nstarted them on the road to the big money<br />\nera of Professional football.<br />\nIn 1966, the two leagues met and decided to<br />\neliminate cutthroat measures of competition. It was not until the league meetings<br />\nof 1970, that it was decided to have a complete merger.<br />\nAs a result, the ten-team American<br />\nFootball League was bolstered by the addition<br />\nof Baltimore, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, and renamed the American Conference.<br />\nThere was a decision to sell NBC the<br />\nFALL<br />\nFOOTBALL<br />\nSat., Sep. 26 Muhlenberg 1:30 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\nSat., Oct. 3 F &amp; M 2:00 p.m. (H)<br />\nSat., Oct. 10 Ursinus 2:00 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\nSat., Oct. 17 Haverford 2:00 p.m.(H)<br />\nSat., Oct. 24 Hampden Sydney 2:00<br /><br />\np.m. (H)<br /><br />\nphotos by peter caloger<br /><br />\nSecond-string goalie Steve Buescher ma' kes a itzve<br /><br />\nSat., Oct. 31 Towson State 2:00 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\nSat., Nov.7 Swarthmore 1:30 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br />\nSat., Nov. 14 Dickinson 2:00 p.m.(H)<br />\nSat., Nov. 21 Western Md. 1:30 p.m.<br />\n(A)<br /><br />\nAmerican Conference games and CBS the<br />\nNational Conference games.

When Football Commissioner<br />\nPete Rozelle went to ABC with a list of the<br />\nMonday night games available, there was a<br />\ngame listed for Monday, September 28<br />\nbetween the Colts and Chiefs at Memorial<br />\nStadium.<br />\nThe problem that now rests in the hands of<br />\na Baltimore judge is whether or not the Colts<br />\nshould be allowed to use the stadium. There<br />\nis a clause in the contracts signed by both the<br />\nColts and Orioles that states there shall be no<br />\nfootball games within forty-eight hours<br />\nbefore a scheduled baseball game.<br />\nThe last time this type of controversy<br />\narose was between the Washington Redskins<br />\nand the Washington Senators over the use of<br />\nKennedy Stadium. The Redskins won their<br />\ncourt battle and played, but as a result of<br />\nrain the day before, the field was put in an<br />\nalmost unusable condition for the rest of the<br />\nbaseball season.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that Commissioner<br />\nRozelle has the power to decide where and<br />\nwhen football games should be played.
