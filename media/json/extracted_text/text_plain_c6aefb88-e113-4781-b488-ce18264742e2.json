This donation should<br />\nnot be looked upon in the same<br />\nlight as are other requests for<br />\nmoney; this fund will be raised by<br />\nall classes, rich and poor alike,<br />\nto show France the true love and<br />\nrespect which the United States,<br />\nas a whole, feel towards her comrade in arms during the late war.<br />\nand it should be considered a<br />\nprivilege to all red-blooded Americans to be allowed to contribute.<br />\nThe amount of money given by<br />\nthe individual is not so important<br />\nas the sentiment attached to the<br />\ngift. The amount required to be<br />\nraised is only $250,000, a sum<br />\nwhich should be fully subscribed<br />\nin short order, but Hopkins wants<br />\nto have her name on the subscriber's book in big letters, and<br />\nthe only way for this to be accomplished is for each and every one<br />\nof us to give his mite.<br />\nLet's try to make this a 100 per<br />\ncent. contribution.<br />\nIn the face of the hardest and<br />\nbest track schedule which it has<br />\never been the opportunity of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University to assume, the track management is<br />\nfacing the dilemma of not having<br />\nenough men to make complete entries in every race!<br />\nTo what can this lethargy ori<br />\nthe part of the Johns Hopkins students be attributed? To the loss<br />\nof the cage? That has certainly<br />\nplaced a large obstacle in the path<br />\nof the indoor squad, which may<br />\nbe considered in great measure accountable for the showing made<br />\n<br />\nat the Fifth Regiment Armory<br />\nmeet; but now the team is practicing at Homewood, and has been<br />\ndoing so for the past several<br />\nweeks. The loss of the cage cannot then be the cause. To the variable and largely disagreeable<br />\nweather conditions which have<br />\nprevailed this year? It would<br />\nseem so. Yet, this is a terrible<br />\naccusation to be forced to admit.<br />\nIt seems that the general run<br />\nof students in our greatly increased student body are perfectly<br />\nsatisfied, when the day's work at<br />\nthe University is over, to let the<br />\nhard, grimy work of the athletic<br />\nfield fall heavily on the shoulders<br />\nof \"Brother George,\" who will<br />\nloyally be there.<br />\nSpeaking from the viewpoint of<br />\n\"big\" athletics at Hopkins, one<br />\nin u s t confess discouragement,<br />\nwhen the size of our track squad<br />\nis measured against the demands<br />\nof the best schedule ever presented to Hopkins students. We cannot be unmindful of the fact that<br />\ntrack work is hard work, and is no<br />\nplace for a man who feels that<br />\nevery member of a team can work<br />\nbut himself. But the rewards amrtly justify the denial, as is evidenced by the men of the past who<br />\nstuck, plodded\u2014and succeeded.<br />\nIt is doubtful if the students of<br />\nthe University appreciate the demands and the excellencies of the<br />\ntrack schedule for 1920. One does<br />\nnot see such a series of contests<br />\nundertaken or presented to its<br />\nstudents by any of the larger universities.<br />\nFor instance, on May 1, the<br />\nPenn Relays, at Philadelphia; on<br />\nMay 8, the South Atlantic Intercollegiates at Blacksburg, Va.;<br />\non May 15, the Middle States<br />\nInter - collegiates, at Rutgers,<br />\nBrunswick, N. J.; and the I.<br />\nc. A. A. A. meet, on May 28<br />\nand 29, in Philadelphia, form a<br />\npermanent skeleton of a schedule which would be the envy<br />\nof allY other university in the<br />\ncountry. Hopkins is brought into<br />\ncompetition with the best in the<br />\nNorth, South, -Middle Atlantic<br />\nStates, the West and Pacific<br />\nCoast. One wonders whether the<br />\naverage undergraduate student appreciates the honor which goes<br />\nwith the above.<br />\nIn addition to the above meets,<br />\ndual meets are scheduled with<br />\nSwarthmore and Delaware Colleges. All of these, together with<br />\nan inter-class meet on April 17,<br />\npresents a continuous track schedule from the middle of April to<br />\nthe last of May, comprising seven<br />\nfirst-class outdoor engagements,<br />\nand bringing Hopkins in touch<br />\nand actual competition with the<br />\nlargest universities of the country.<br />\nThe track authorities have<br />\nbrought about a wonderful opportunity for the University, and it<br />\nis only fair that it should have<br />\nthe whole-hearted \u2022 support and<br />\nbacking of those who call the University their own. This means unselfish effort, self-sacrifice and<br />\nhard work. It &es not compre-<br />\n<br />\nhend letting other men carry the<br />\nbanner, or manifest itself in running home immediately after the<br />\nschool session is over. It means<br />\nkeeping off the blacklist, and a<br />\ndenial of personal pleasures, such<br />\nas tea parties, dances, cigarettes,,<br />\nlate hours and kindred enjoyments, which can very soon produce a dangerous effeteness. It<br />\nmeans all of this, but the track<br />\nmanagement believes that there is<br />\na fundamental spirit at Hopkins,<br />\nand that all it needs is an awakening. On the faith of that belief,<br />\nthe above schedule was undertaken.<br />\nThe track team needs support;<br />\nit needs a larger squad. The students can help.

They call \"Doug\"<br />\nCotton \"the mole!' Why? Don't<br />\nask me. I don't know whether he<br />\ninherited the title or just accumulated it; but, be that as it may,<br />\nthat which concerns us most right<br />\nat present is that the worthy Cotton passes under the name of<br />\n\"Mole.\" Now, to get to my story;<br />\n\"Mole\" Cotton surprised his<br />\nfriends and others a few nights<br />\nago by dolling himself up in a<br />\nmonkey suit.and going to a dance.<br />\nIt was quite an elegant affair, not<br />\nthe kind that most of you participate in down at the House of Horrors, the Automobile Club, but a<br />\nreal society function, and all the<br />\nhighbrows, they were there. The<br />\nstory runs that the first person to<br />\nnotice \"Mole\" Cotton's triumphant<br />\nentry into the glittering ballroom<br />\nwas our own \"Bob\"<br />\nall, who<br />\ngently whispered to the fair maiden with whom he was toddling,<br />\n\"See the Mole!\" Now, as chance<br />\nw-ould have it, right in the line of<br />\nvision of above-mentioned fair<br />\nmaiden was another maiden, also<br />\nfair, on the direct center of whose<br />\nneck was what all surgeons and<br />\nbeauty specialists agree to call a<br />\nmole. Now, fair maiden No. 1,<br />\ninterpreting \"Bobby's\" remark to<br />\nhave been directed at fair maiden<br />\nNo. 2, instead of at the illustrious<br />\nCotton, blushed a delicate shade<br />\nof yellow- and tittered, \"Oh, Bob,<br />\nyou shouldn't notice such things.\"<br />\nNow, that's not so crying funny<br />\nin itself, but the point I want to<br />\nemphasize is that we should take<br />\nthe young lady's advice and not<br />\nnotice the \"Mole\" (I mean<br />\n\"Mole\" Cotton), he gets too confounded much notoriety anyway.<br />\nI don't know why I am putting<br />\nhim in my Quack Column.<br />\nBut suppose we forget the<br />\n\"Mee\" for the time being, and let<br />\nme tell you about this little fellow<br />\nHarrison, from V.

The amount required to be<br />\nraised is only $250,000, a sum<br />\nwhich should be fully subscribed<br />\nin short order, but Hopkins wants<br />\nto have her name on the subscriber's book in big letters, and<br />\nthe only way for this to be accomplished is for each and every one<br />\nof us to give his mite.<br />\nLet's try to make this a 100 per<br />\ncent. contribution.<br />\nIn the face of the hardest and<br />\nbest track schedule which it has<br />\never been the opportunity of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University to assume, the track management is<br />\nfacing the dilemma of not having<br />\nenough men to make complete entries in every race!<br />\nTo what can this lethargy ori<br />\nthe part of the Johns Hopkins students be attributed? To the loss<br />\nof the cage? That has certainly<br />\nplaced a large obstacle in the path<br />\nof the indoor squad, which may<br />\nbe considered in great measure accountable for the showing made<br /><br />\nat the Fifth Regiment Armory<br />\nmeet; but now the team is practicing at Homewood, and has been<br />\ndoing so for the past several<br />\nweeks. The loss of the cage cannot then be the cause. To the variable and largely disagreeable<br />\nweather conditions which have<br />\nprevailed this year? It would<br />\nseem so. Yet, this is a terrible<br />\naccusation to be forced to admit.<br />\nIt seems that the general run<br />\nof students in our greatly increased student body are perfectly<br />\nsatisfied, when the day's work at<br />\nthe University is over, to let the<br />\nhard, grimy work of the athletic<br />\nfield fall heavily on the shoulders<br />\nof \"Brother George,\" who will<br />\nloyally be there.<br />\nSpeaking from the viewpoint of<br />\n\"big\" athletics at Hopkins, one<br />\nin u s t confess discouragement,<br />\nwhen the size of our track squad<br />\nis measured against the demands<br />\nof the best schedule ever presented to Hopkins students. We cannot be unmindful of the fact that<br />\ntrack work is hard work, and is no<br />\nplace for a man who feels that<br />\nevery member of a team can work<br />\nbut himself. But the rewards amrtly justify the denial, as is evidenced by the men of the past who<br />\nstuck, plodded\u2014and succeeded.<br />\nIt is doubtful if the students of<br />\nthe University appreciate the demands and the excellencies of the<br />\ntrack schedule for 1920. One does<br />\nnot see such a series of contests<br />\nundertaken or presented to its<br />\nstudents by any of the larger universities.<br />\nFor instance, on May 1, the<br />\nPenn Relays, at Philadelphia; on<br />\nMay 8, the South Atlantic Intercollegiates at Blacksburg, Va.;<br />\non May 15, the Middle States<br />\nInter - collegiates, at Rutgers,<br />\nBrunswick, N. J.; and the I.<br />\nc. A. A. A. meet, on May 28<br />\nand 29, in Philadelphia, form a<br />\npermanent skeleton of a schedule which would be the envy<br />\nof allY other university in the<br />\ncountry. Hopkins is brought into<br />\ncompetition with the best in the<br />\nNorth, South, -Middle Atlantic<br />\nStates, the West and Pacific<br />\nCoast. One wonders whether the<br />\naverage undergraduate student appreciates the honor which goes<br />\nwith the above.<br />\nIn addition to the above meets,<br />\ndual meets are scheduled with<br />\nSwarthmore and Delaware Colleges. All of these, together with<br />\nan inter-class meet on April 17,<br />\npresents a continuous track schedule from the middle of April to<br />\nthe last of May, comprising seven<br />\nfirst-class outdoor engagements,<br />\nand bringing Hopkins in touch<br />\nand actual competition with the<br />\nlargest universities of the country.<br />\nThe track authorities have<br />\nbrought about a wonderful opportunity for the University, and it<br />\nis only fair that it should have<br />\nthe whole-hearted \u2022 support and<br />\nbacking of those who call the University their own. This means unselfish effort, self-sacrifice and<br />\nhard work. It &amp;es not compre-<br /><br />\nhend letting other men carry the<br />\nbanner, or manifest itself in running home immediately after the<br />\nschool session is over. It means<br />\nkeeping off the blacklist, and a<br />\ndenial of personal pleasures, such<br />\nas tea parties, dances, cigarettes,,<br />\nlate hours and kindred enjoyments, which can very soon produce a dangerous effeteness. It<br />\nmeans all of this, but the track<br />\nmanagement believes that there is<br />\na fundamental spirit at Hopkins,<br />\nand that all it needs is an awakening. On the faith of that belief,<br />\nthe above schedule was undertaken.<br />\nThe track team needs support;<br />\nit needs a larger squad. The students can help. Is it worth while<br />\nto compete with Harvard, Ya-le,<br />\nPrinceton, California, Lafayette,<br />\nSwarthmore, Rutgers and others?<br />\nIf it is, show some college spirit<br />\nand come out.<br />\nCommander McFarland Lectures.<br />\nCommander Walter M. -McFarland, the manager of the marine<br /><br />\ndepartment of the Babcock and<br />\nWilcox.

Chief<br />\namong these men. was Mr. Westinghouse, in whose employ Commander McFarland served for a<br />\nnumber of years. The story of<br />\nhow- the Westinghouse Air Brake<br />\nfor railroad cars came to be invented and perfected proves very<br />\nconclusively that a good measure<br />\nof common sense is well worth<br />\nhaving.<br />\n\"Concealing Coloration and Cimoufla gip,\"<br />\nSubject of Lecture.<br /><br />\nOn Thursday, March 25, an illustrated lecture on \"Concealing<br />\nColoration and Camouflage\" will<br />\nbe given by Mr. Gerald H.

They call \"Doug\"<br />\nCotton \"the mole!' Why? Don't<br />\nask me. I don't know whether he<br />\ninherited the title or just accumulated it; but, be that as it may,<br />\nthat which concerns us most right<br />\nat present is that the worthy Cotton passes under the name of<br />\n\"Mole.\" Now, to get to my story;<br />\n\"Mole\" Cotton surprised his<br />\nfriends and others a few nights<br />\nago by dolling himself up in a<br />\nmonkey suit.and going to a dance.<br />\nIt was quite an elegant affair, not<br />\nthe kind that most of you participate in down at the House of Horrors, the Automobile Club, but a<br />\nreal society function, and all the<br />\nhighbrows, they were there. The<br />\nstory runs that the first person to<br />\nnotice \"Mole\" Cotton's triumphant<br />\nentry into the glittering ballroom<br />\nwas our own \"Bob\"<br />\nall, who<br />\ngently whispered to the fair maiden with whom he was toddling,<br />\n\"See the Mole!\" Now, as chance<br />\nw-ould have it, right in the line of<br />\nvision of above-mentioned fair<br />\nmaiden was another maiden, also<br />\nfair, on the direct center of whose<br />\nneck was what all surgeons and<br />\nbeauty specialists agree to call a<br />\nmole. Now, fair maiden No. 1,<br />\ninterpreting \"Bobby's\" remark to<br />\nhave been directed at fair maiden<br />\nNo. 2, instead of at the illustrious<br />\nCotton, blushed a delicate shade<br />\nof yellow- and tittered, \"Oh, Bob,<br />\nyou shouldn't notice such things.\"<br />\nNow, that's not so crying funny<br />\nin itself, but the point I want to<br />\nemphasize is that we should take<br />\nthe young lady's advice and not<br />\nnotice the \"Mole\" (I mean<br />\n\"Mole\" Cotton), he gets too confounded much notoriety anyway.<br />\nI don't know why I am putting<br />\nhim in my Quack Column.<br />\nBut suppose we forget the<br />\n\"Mee\" for the time being, and let<br />\nme tell you about this little fellow<br />\nHarrison, from V.

While<br />\nnot calculated to convince any<br />\nreally abandoned Bolshevist that<br />\nhis cause is wrong and futile, it<br />\nwill provide many who were wavering with something tangible to<br />\ncling to; indeed, it will be hard<br />\nfor anyone to reconcile himself to<br />\naccepting so drab an existence as<br />\nthat which the particular group<br />\nof which Poldek in is a lowly member proposes. While not free from<br />\nmany of the hokums which Mr.<br />\nTarkington knows so well how to<br />\nuse, the play is amazingly successful in accomplishing its announced \"purpose,\" and in being<br />\nexceedingly amusing at the same<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe acting of Mr. Arliss, in the<br />\ntitle role, was buoyantly arresting. At all times, he was in complete control of the situation, and,<br />\nif he was just a trifle too gay; if<br />\nhe showed just a bit too little of<br />\nhis thinker's side, he may feel<br />\njustified in the knowledge that he<br />\nlifted the play out of the class of<br />\n\"play with a purpose,\" and made<br />\na warm, diverting human exhibit.<br />\nThe Literary Club may congratulate itself on the felicity of<br />\nthe substitution of such a play as<br />\n\"Poldekin,\" for the girl and music<br />\nshow originally announced.<br />\n1HE ART OF LANGUAGE<br /><br />\n(Continuedfrom page 2)<br />\nploy?
