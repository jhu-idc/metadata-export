Thomas said also that his<br />\noffice has no figures on minority<br />\napplications as of now.<br />\nThe Admissions Director attributed the upward surge in applicants in the three fields to the<br />\nUniversity's participation in the<br />\nStudent Search Survey, which enables more students in the nonNatural Sciences areas to receive<br />\ninformation about Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\n\"Because of the student survey<br />\nin these three fields we were able<br />\nto give good exposure for students who would not have<br />\nthought of Hopkins,\" Thomas<br />\nstated.<br />\nQuantitative Scierices exhibited an increase of only one person<br />\nto 97, while those students listed<br />\nin the undecided category declined by over 100.<br />\nConcerning the entire applicant pool, Thomas noted that<br />\nthis year's increase is in part due<br />\nto an expanded travelling schedule by his office, as well as an<br />\neffort towards more personal<br />\ncontact.<br />\n\"Our traveling and visiting of<br />\nschools has had some effect. We<br />\n<br />\neyect a carryover effect into the<br />\nnekt 'few years. We've also tried<br />\nto Make' our contact with students more -personal this years\"<br />\n\"There's been a riatiOnwide<br />\ntrend this year in application to<br />\nall of the more selective schools<br />\nin the country,\" Thomas said.<br />\nSince September, Thomas and<br />\nhis staff have travelled extensively, especially in the Western United States. As a result, applications from Arizona, California,<br />\nColorado and New Mexico went<br />\nup by 18 to 88.<br />\nCalifornia and Colorado accounted for the majority of the<br />\nrise, with the latter showing the<br />\ngreatest change with 22 applications, twelve more than the 1974<br />\ntotal.<br />\nNatural Sciences showed an increase with a net gain of over 130<br />\nas did pre-med applicants, whose<br />\ntotal is approximately 1600.<br />\nDespite the increase in the<br />\nNatural Sciences, Thomas expects to accept a large percentage<br />\nof Humanities, Engineering, and<br />\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences<br />\nmajors, mainly due to the \"improved quality of the applicant<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nThomas termed this year's<br />\ngroup \"the best group Hopkins<br />\nhas had.\"<br />\n<br />\nAC reviews SC Academic Reports<br />\nBy ALAN HIRSCH<br />\nThe Academic Council reviewed the Student Council's Academic Reports at a special meeting Tuesday evening, where the<br />\nmembers \"filtered out\" the portions they believed invalid or inaccurate, Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences George Owen disclosed.<br />\nThe AC members screened the<br />\nReports for sections that were<br />\nnot valid, so that they can proceed now to utilize the Reports<br />\nin their evaluations of the departments, Owen said.<br />\nHe stated that while the Reports have been, for the most<br />\npart, received favorably by the<br />\nfaculty, several department chairmen have complained of inaccuracies in the Reports, stemming<br />\nlargely from the SC's failure to<br />\nmake changes suggested by the<br />\ndepartments after the presentation of the Reports' initial drafts.<br />\nA number of department<br />\nchairmen have pointed out certain problems in the Reports resulting from their heavy reliance<br />\non Teacher Evaluation (TEVAL)<br />\ndata, the validity of which has<br />\ncome under question.<br />\n\"It's simply not scientific,\"<br />\nsaid Philosophy Chairman Peter<br />\nAchinstein of the Reports.<br />\n\"The evaluation of TEVAL<br />\nhas always been troublesome. It<br />\nhas all types of problems,\" commented Dr. Gordon Wolman,<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering head.<br />\n\"It's almost impossible to evaluate teaching by anyone,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nAnother department head,<br />\nEnglish Chairman Ron'ald<br />\nPaulson, termed the Reports<br />\n\"quite fair\" with \"just a few mistakes.\"<br />\nOne change he recommended<br />\nafter the initial draft\u2014the elimination of a suggestion for more<br />\nwriting courses since those are<br />\nthe responsibility of the Writing<br />\nSeminars\u2014was accepted and incorporated into the final draft of<br />\nthe Reports, he said.<br />\nPaulson stated that the department is taking the Reports' rec-<br />\n<br />\nommendations seriously, and has<br />\nbeen deliberating on the recommendation to abolish requirements for upper level courses<br />\nsince the Fall.<br />\nOwen noted that the primary<br />\ninfluence of the Reports will<br />\ncome through their \"persuasive<br />\npowers\" and not through attempts by the SC to \"legislate\"<br />\nthe recommendations to the faculty and administration.<br />\n<br />\nHe said that some bad feeling<br />\non the part of faculty of certain<br />\ndepartments derives from the Reports' straightforward, often<br />\nblunt appraisals of individual professors.<br />\nThe Dean also said that the unprecedented situation of undergraduates evaluating faculty has<br />\nbeen partially responsible for<br />\nsome of the unfavorable reactions to the Reports.<br />\n<br />\nh<br />\nf.<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nGlen Thomas<br />\n\"We will be able to put together the best freshman class. The<br />\nquality of the group is better this<br />\nyear.

A new degree program in dance is scheduled for implementation in September, 1975.<br />\nFiscal alterations have necessitated the reduction of the present academic program by approximately $200,000, while alloca-<br />\n<br />\ntions for new additions to the<br />\nthe termination of one full-time<br />\nprograms amount to $184,000. position in each of the departIf the plans are approved by<br />\nments of Education, English,<br />\nthe College Assembly, Goucher Mathematics, Philosophy, and<br />\nwill no longer offer majors in the Physical Education.

He said he realizes,<br />\nhowever, that he is attempting to<br />\novercome the triple disadvantage<br />\nof years of mismanagement, recent public cynicism towards<br />\ngovernment, and often hostile<br />\npress.<br />\n\"It's in the press itself,\" he declared. \"The writers are cynical<br />\nand they ought to be cynical. In<br />\nBaltimore County, the press<br />\nmissed the corruption completely. It took the Washington Post<br />\nto break the story of Baltimore<br />\nCounty corruption.\"<br />\n\"Because of that,\" he stated,<br />\n\"they \" have tried with a vengeance to kind of catch up.\"<br />\nHowever, he acknowledged<br />\nthat intensive interest in government, on the part of both the<br />\npublic and the press, is necessary<br />\ningredient in equitable<br />\ncrovernment.<br />\n<br />\nAfter a short declaration of<br />\nthe aims and purposes of his adVenetoulis opened the floor to<br />\nquestions from the audience.<br />\nOne listener seized the opportunity to inquire about the recent defeat of Venetoulis' nominee for the office of County Administrator, Jim Reed. The decision created many political undercurrents in Baltimore County<br />\nadministration. Venetoulis cited<br />\nhimself as the political catalyst<br />\nwhich caused Reed's eventual rejection for this office by the<br />\nBaltimore County Council. He<br />\nsaid that by proposing a largescale urban-renewal program several weeks before 'the nomination, he had given a right-wing<br />\nminority the chance to coalesce<br />\ninto a vocal political group.<br />\nUsing this as a starting point,<br />\nVenetoulis then launched into an<br />\nanimated discourse on the relationship between Baltimore<br />\nCounty administration and the<br />\nCouncil. \"To me, the biggest<br />\nproblem with the Council's behavior was that they violated a<br />\ntraditional executive-legislative<br />\nrelationship,\" he declared. \"By<br />\nthe violation, they caused great<br />\ngrief to the county.\"<br />\n\"I don't intend to let the<br />\nCouncil run the government,\" he<br />\nfurther asserted. \"I would be violating my own sense of responsibility if I did that.\"<br />\nHe did state, however, that<br />\none heartening aspect of the incident was the appearance of voluminous editorial support of<br />\nReed. He said this indicated that<br />\nthere is an increasing positive attitude in the county, which he<br />\nexpects to greatly aid him in his<br />\n<br />\nprogram of reform.<br />\n<br />\nTed Venetoulis<br />\n<br />\nIn response to a question on<br />\nBaltimore County and Baltimore<br />\nCity relationships, Venetoulis<br />\nstated that his administration<br />\nwould seek greater cooperation<br />\nbetween the two governmental<br />\nstructures than was previously<br />\nexhibited.<br />\nHe used as an example for this<br />\ncooperation the problem of<br />\ndredging the Baltimore City harbor and depositing the sludge on<br />\nHart Miller Island.<br />\nWhile he acknowledged the necessity of dredging the harbor to<br />\npreserve the economic base of<br />\nthe city, as an avowed environmentalist Venetoulis is opposed<br />\nto the dumping of the residue at<br />\n<br />\nthat location. Even though he<br />\nwas opposed to this action, he<br />\nwas concerned enough about<br />\nCounty-City relationships that he<br />\nrefused to participate on the panel reviewing the problem unless<br />\nMayor Schaeffer of Baltimore City was also present.<br />\nAfter further inquiries, Venetoulis strongly asserted that he is<br />\ncompletely opposed to any form<br />\nof merger between the city and<br />\ncounty governments. He feels<br />\nthat the main problem with government is that it is too centralized, bureaucratic, and unwieldy.<br />\n\"Democracy assumes a certain<br />\namount of inefficiency for the<br />\nrunning of government,\" he said.<br />\n<br />\nRhoda Dorsey<br />\nment in 1978-79.<br />\nGoucher officials maintain<br />\nthat the proposed changes reflect<br />\nthe College's effort to \"modernize and progress in order to meet<br />\nthe needs of contemporary women,\" but admit that the revisions were catalyzed by fiscal<br />\nconsiderations.<br />\nBillet said, \"In the 60's an institution could add to its program in a wholesale fashion without severe fiscal consequences.<br />\nThe expensive administrations of<br />\nthat era are no longer possible.<br />\nHard fiscal facts must be cast<br />\nagainst certain benefits.\"<br />\nHe asserted, \"We believe that<br />\nthere is a real need for our kind<br />\nof institution, therefore we must<br />\nchange to meet the academic and<br />\nfinancial criteria of the times. We<br />\nwill not only survive, but we will<br />\nremain great, because of<br />\nGoucher's capacity for change.\"<br />\nCollege Assembly meetings<br />\nwere held on both Monday and<br />\nWednesday of this week.

The referendum has been delayed until<br />\nsometime in late April.<br />\nThe good news is that the Student Council has launched a<br />\nnew committee to further modify the proctoring proposal<br />\ngiven by the old committee, whose suggestion was<br />\npronounced infeasible by those administrators affected by it.<br />\nDuring three weeks of deliberating and formulating a<br />\nproposal, the original committee failed to officially consult<br />\nDean Sigmund Suskind before making public their<br />\nsuggestion, which called for a major revision of the Dean's<br />\ncurrent role in arbitrating academic offenses. Thus, upon the<br />\nDean's disapproval, the panel had nothing to show for all its<br />\nextended deadlines and exhaustive investigation but an<br />\nuntenable proposal.<br />\nFollowing the acknowledged \"tactical blunder,\" the<br />\nCouncil voted this week to work the proposal into a form<br />\nacceptable to all concerned with the aid of a student-faculty<br />\ncommittee. We urge that this latest foray into the realm of<br />\nUniversity policy be conducted with greater efficiency than<br />\nthe previous one, and that the panel abandon the irrational<br />\nconviction that those affected by policy changes should not<br />\nbe consulted about them.<br />\nIf the referendum is not held as soon as possible this<br />\nsemester, student interest in this important issue will wane to<br />\na point that may threaten the validity of a full student vote.<br />\nAnd if this isn't settled by the close of this semester...well,<br />\nit's a long summer.<br />\n<br />\nBy ANDREW WALDER<br />\n\"Hearts and Minds\",-a new movie on our Vietnam War (At the<br />\nCerberus I Theater, M Street,<br />\nGeorgetown), is more than just a<br />\npowerfully realistic documentary<br />\n\u2014it is also a sobering reflection on<br />\nAmericans and America. Without<br />\nemploying a narrator, the producers, by splicing together interviews with Americans and<br />\nVietnamese, along with clips of<br />\nspeeches by American politicians<br />\nand extensive footage of killing<br />\nand bombing, have succeeded in<br />\nputting forward a powerful message about ill-founded American<br />\nattitudes and the destruction and<br />\nsuffering they have caused (and are<br />\nstill causing).<br />\n\"Hearts and Minds\" pulls no<br />\npunches\u2014it literally numbs a viewer with a chilling account of what<br />\nthis war means at a basic human<br />\nlevel. Napalmed children, their<br />\ncharred skin hanging from their naked bodies, run screaming down a<br />\ndirt road away from their flaming<br />\nvillage. Several husky, fully equipped and uniformed G.I.'s take<br />\nturns 'interrogating' a skinny,<br />\nyouthful Vietnamese (a VC?), who<br />\nis clad only in a shirt and shorts. In<br />\nthis 'interrogation' the youth is<br />\nkicked repeatedly in the groin by<br />\nthe booted soldiers, and through<br />\nthe whole ordeal the frightened,<br />\nwincing youth's glazed eyes stare<br />\nstraight into the camera.<br />\nEven more gripping are the interviews with peasants who lived<br />\nthrough American bombing raids.<br />\nAn elderly, wrinkled woman relates that her home and village<br />\nwere devastated by bombs from an<br />\n<br />\nunseen plane (B-52). Gradually losing her composure, she explains<br />\n\"My sister is dead...I have no<br />\none...I have no home...nowhere to<br />\ngo...nothing to do.\" Then, for an<br />\ninterminable sixty seconds, she just<br />\ncries.<br />\nShow It To Your President<br />\nThe attitudes of the Vietnamese<br />\nabout the war come across eqully<br />\nclear. A South Vietnamese business<br />\nexecutive explains how he is planning to capitalize on the economic<br />\n\"take-off\" that will occur as soon<br />\nas the military situation stabilizes.<br />\nIt seems that other sectors of<br />\nVietnamese society have different<br />\nperspectives, however. A Saigon<br />\nshopkeeper confides\u2014\"The prcrblem is American imperialism\u2014this<br />\nis a war for national independence.\" A warehouse worker in the<br />\nSouth explains that the Saigon government is the biggest obstacle to<br />\npeace, and that the people are<br />\nafraid to speak out against it. A<br />\nCatholic priest puts the situation a<br />\nbit differently\u2014the Thieu regime is<br />\nthe opponent of peace and justice.<br />\nThey arrest and torture those who<br />\nspeak out for peace and freedom,<br />\nand brand them as communists. In<br />\ndoing so, they are defeating themselves, for they are teaching people<br />\nthat the communists are the forces<br />\nof peace and justice.<br />\nA peasant in the North is far less<br />\nanalytical. He explains that his village is isolated, and irately asks the<br />\ncameraman why the Americans<br />\nhave bombed it. He points to a pile<br />\nof rubble, and reveals that the bodies of his wife and daughter lie<br />\nthere. His voice cracking, he points<br />\nto another spot, saying that his<br />\n<br />\neight-year-old daughter was feeding<br />\nthe pigs there when the bombs \u2022<br />\nstruck. She died instantly. The<br />\nman's voice rises and breaks. He<br />\nwalks in circles, gesticulating wildly and raving at the camera-man.<br />\n\"What have we done to you<br />\nAmericans? Do we bomb your children?\".. He begins to sob as he<br />\npicks a tattered shirt out of the<br />\nrubble. \"Here\u2014this was my daughter's shirt. Look at it...take it back<br />\nto America...show it to your president...throw it in Nixon's face...<br />\n(screaming)...tell him he is the<br />\nmurderer of little girls!\"<br />\nNot only are Vietnamese attitudes revealed, but American attitudes are also given their fair share<br />\nof time. These are the attitudes<br />\nthat make senseless devastation<br />\npossible. An Air Force pilot relates<br />\nthe satisfaction he feels upon completing a successful bombing mission. He sees himself not as a killer<br />\nbut as a 'skilled technician'. A father of a dead Vietnam vet, when<br />\nasked if he felt if his son's death<br />\nwas for a worthwhile cause, replies: \"Americans are taught to<br />\nobey their government. When we<br />\nare called upon, we have an obliga-<br />\n<br />\ntion to obey. I believe in our President...I believe he did what he had<br />\nto do...\" John Foster Dulles reveals<br />\nthat communism is a growing cancer that must be halted before it<br />\nspreads. But a young co-ed demurs,<br />\nexplaining: \"I'm only interested in<br />\nwhat affects me the most\".<br />\nScene: a coffin is draped with a<br />\nSouth Vietnamese flag. Two young<br />\nboys stand in front of it, wailing,<br />\none holding a portrait of his dead<br />\nfather in his hands, the other beating his fists and head upon the coffin. Their mother stands by, sobbing quietly. Six military pall-bearers pick up the coffin and carry it<br />\nout to a field. The children wail<br />\neven more loudly, following closely and looking alternately at their<br />\nfather's portrait and the coffin. As<br />\nthe box is lowered into the grave,<br />\nthe mother breaks down, wailing<br />\nand talking incoherently, and tries<br />\nto climb into the grave with her<br />\ndead husband. She struggles with<br />\nthe pall-bearers who pull her out of<br />\nthe gave, and finally gives up, staring silently at the dirt being<br />\nthrown over the casket.<br />\nNext Scene: the edge of a peaceful lake. General Westmoreland,<br />\n<br />\ncommander of the U.S. forces<br />\nfrom 1964-68, explains smugly:<br />\n\"You have to understand...the<br />\nOriental does not place as high a<br />\nvalue on human life as we do.\"<br />\nThe message of the film is.conveyed in the final few scenes<br />\n\u2014Americans have tried hard not to<br />\nlearn from their Vietnam experience.<br />\n...A parade.

The police<br />\nmove in, violence ensues, bloodied<br />\nprotesters are hauled into police<br />\nwagons. One of the protesting veterans avoids the police and seeks<br />\nout the camera amidst the confusion. \"What the hell is this?\", he<br />\npleads, \"We were there, we fought<br />\nthere, we know what it's all about.<br />\nWhy won't they listen?\"<br />\n\"Hearts and Minds\" deserves<br />\nmore than the academy award it<br />\nhas been nominated for\u2014it deserves to be seen.<br />\n<br />\nAnd in this corner we have jazz<br />\nBy J.D.

to<br />\nBaltimore at the Painter's Mill Music Fair, critics say he's the \"second coming\" of that Minnesota<br />\nenigma, but he knows better than<br />\nthat, he makes up lines that rhyme<br />\nthree times in a row, (\"Madman<br />\ndrummers bummers and Indians in<br />\nthe summer\") sings about Seaside<br />\nbars buried in the \"swamps of<br />\nJersey\" and he's got a reputation<br />\nfor flashing on the stage, dying<br />\nonce or twice for his own pleasure,<br />\nand it looks like another sellout<br />\nperformance.<br />\nThe crowd's impatient waiting<br />\nfor the emerging Prince, they're tired of walking up slanted floors to<br />\nthe bar, stepping heavy on each<br />\nother's fingers, Painter's Mill is<br />\nstuffed, (to the hilt! to the hilt!)<br />\nit's a small hall, but the music<br />\nsounds right, spotlight on<br />\nSpringsteen as he takes the stage,<br />\nhe's already got the audience with<br />\nhim, and he winks to the chick in<br />\nthe back who duplicates his dance<br />\nto the front, pointing her violin to<br />\nthe side, she nods her head and<br />\nSpringsteen grabs the mike, he<br />\nstarts to suffer and sings: \"Spanish<br />\nJohnny drove in from the underworld last.night.\"<br />\nCrazy Janey and her Mission Man<br />\nAs the song ends, the crowd<br />\ncries as Springsteen snickers in the<br />\nblue lights, and the E Street Band<br />\n<br />\ncomes marching to their own time,<br />\nhuddles with the bashful Prince,<br />\nand somebody's yelling to the saxophonist, \"Hey Clarence, I think<br />\nyou play real fine, we'll play basketball some time, and take the<br />\ngirls out for a climb, over that distant Jersey border\" and everybody's smiling as the band swings<br />\ninto \"Spirit in the Night,\" they<br />\nplay the same songs all the time<br />\nbut no one seems to mind;'cause<br />\nthey got the power of a group verging on superstardom, afid they all<br />\nknow it, that's why they laugh<br />\nwhen Springsteen growls, \"Crazy<br />\nJane and her mission man were<br />\nback in the alley tradin' hands...<br />\njust like spirits in the night.\"<br />\nAnd so the highlights come and<br />\ngo, the audience is clapping with<br />\nthe band, as the swirling Prince<br />\nlands on his toes, screaming to the<br />\nceiling, bathing in the blue and<br />\ngreen glows, with a her's gleam he<br />\nlooks to the certter row, where he<br />\nduels with a mock monk made up<br />\nfor the show, everybody knows it's<br />\nthe final time in the Painter's Mill<br />\nfor Springsteen and his band, it's<br />\ntoo small to hold them, but right<br />\nnow it's \"spirits in the night, all<br />\nnight, every night.\"<br />\nAnd just when the music starts<br />\nto lull, too much excitement can<br />\nbe deceptively dull, Clarence takes<br />\na bow, steps to the mike, says<br />\n\"Hey, I got somethin' to spill,\"<br />\nand the crowd leans toward the<br />\n<br />\nstage as Clarence whispers \"Kitty's<br />\nback,\" all eyes turn to the writhing<br />\nPrince, who's been alone on the<br />\nside, and he moves to the front,<br />\nbouncing with his tale of low life<br />\nmuscle, harlots in the back seat,<br />\nhe's so fast, he's so sly, pacing the<br />\nstage as the band builds and builds,<br />\n\"Here she comes, here she comes,<br />\nhere she comes\" and explodes<br />\n\"KITTY'S BACK IN TOWN<br />\nKitty's back in town.\"<br />\nSpringsteen settles back into the<br />\nrest of his routine, playing guitar<br />\nand looking half as mean as the<br />\nmodel of his stories, and he races<br />\nuntil the end, says that he's doing<br />\n\"Rosalita\" with special care, the<br />\ncrowd goes wild and soon everyone's waiting for the encore.<br />\nThe triumphant Prince returns<br />\nto the stage, runs through two<br />\nmore songs and is out for the<br />\nnight, leaving half the people in the<br />\nhall feeling like they've been part<br />\nof an event, someone said it was<br />\neven kind of holy, and Springsteen<br />\nkeeps touring with his band, playing every city and creating a base<br />\nof fans, he's been singing all these<br />\nyears and now he's about to dominate rock and roll, but that's never<br />\nbeen his goal, he'd just as soon<br />\nstand under a streetlight, throwing<br />\npebbles, starting a fight, doesn't<br />\ncare if he's a scruffy sight, together<br />\nwith his band, he'll sing \"like a spirit in the night, all night, every<br />\nnight.\"<br />\n<br />\nThE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\neditors-in-chief<br

Discussion<br />\nregarding the creation of a lottery system began in April of last year. Much time<br />\nand effort has gone into the development of the lottery. It is felt that through this<br />\nsystem assignment of vacant spaces in these facilities will be accomplished in the<br />\nfairest possible manner.<br />\nA series of seven lottery drawings will be used to assign vacant spaces in<br />\nthese two buildings for the 1975/76 academic year. Each one.of the seven lottery<br />\ndrawings has been designed to make assignments by the number of vacancies in an<br />\napartment in each building. Lottery drawings will be held over a period of 8 days<br />\nallowing those students not selected in one drawing the opportunity to decide whether<br />\nthey desire to enter a subsequent drawing. The first lottery (for single spaces) will<br />\nbe held Monday, March 17, 1975.<br />\nFor those students who desire to enter the lottery, lottery packets are<br />\navailable at three locations: Housing Office in Wolman Hall, Office of Residential<br />\nLife in the Alumni Memorial Residences, and the Dean of Students Office in the<br />\nHopkins Union. Each packetcontains an information sheet outlining the procedures<br />\ngoverning the lottery and 'official' lottery cards to be used for participation in the lottery.<br />\nAny questions concerning the lottery for assignment of spaces in<br />\nWolman Hall and Rogers House should be directed to the Housing Office.<br />\nWolman Hall<br />\n3339 N.

Despite the<br />\ndecrease, the annual giving office<br />\nsaid that more money has been<br />\ncontributed this year than last<br />\nyear at this time.<br />\nThe phonathon was initiated<br />\nlast year by Cover. However, its<br />\nsuccess was limited due to the<br />\nsmall turnout of volunteers to<br />\nman the telephones.<br />\nCover, however, said that this<br />\nyear more than two hundred<br />\nalumni and friends of alumni will<br />\nman the phones. He also said he<br />\nhopes to include members pf the<br />\nuniversity community in it.<br />\n\"I's like to see the phonathon<br />\ninvolve as many segments of the<br />\n<br />\nuniversity as possible. We'd like<br />\nto have students involved in any<br />\nway possible,\" Cover said.<br />\nCover indicated that several<br />\nundergraduate campus organizations have already promised to<br />\nenlist the support of some of<br />\ntheir members.<br />\nCovers also stated that the idea<br />\nof the phonathon would spur<br />\nalumni interest in Hopkins. Cover<br />\nnoted that many alumni still have<br />\nbad feelings toward Hopkins as a<br />\nresult of the riots and demonstrations on the ca. mpus during the<br />\nlate 1960's. By enlisting student<br />\nand alumni help for the phonathon. Cover hopes to erase this<br />\n<br />\nimage of Hopkins in the minds of<br />\nsome of.the alumni.<br />\n\"Basically the phonathon is to<br />\ncommunicate, to let the alumni<br />\nknow what things are growing at<br />\nHopkins,\" Cover said.<br />\nThe.phonathon is a commonly<br />\nused means of soliciiting funds<br />\nfor alumni throughout alunni offices in the United States.

The scrimmage<br />\nbetween Hobart and Hopkins was<br />\noriginally scheduled for<br />\nWednesday, but heavy rain cancelled it.<br />\nHobart which is in town to<br />\nscrimmage University of Balt-<br />\n<br />\nimore and Morgan State, stayed<br />\nover and the scrimmage was played on Thursday. The game ended<br />\njust prior to press time and final<br />\nstatistics were unavailable, but<br />\nthe score at the end of regulation<br />\ntime stood at approximately 22-9<br />\nwith the Jays on the long end.<br />\nHobart finished second to<br />\nTowson State in the College Division last year and the Blue Jays<br />\n<br />\nwere looking for a, tough hardfought scrimmage from a fast and<br />\nphysical team. Instead they<br />\ntrounced an inferior opponent<br />\nwhcse main characteristic were<br />\nsloppy gound-ball play and a<br />\ngambling, pressing defense which<br />\ngot burned many times. Their<br />\noffense was almost non-existent<br />\nwith what little there was of it<br />\nprovided by All-American middie<br />\n<br />\nDiamondmen drop opener, 9-0<br />\nBy ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nThe Hopkins baseball team got<br />\nits first taste of intercollegiate<br />\ncompetition Tuesday as they<br />\nchallenged the diarnondmen of the<br />\nCommunity College of Baltimore. The Blue Jays didn't fare<br />\ntoo well, dropping the seven inning contest by the score of 9-0.<br />\nFor Hopkins, the purpose of<br />\nthe scrimmage, their first this<br />\nspring, was not to necessarily<br />\nturn in a winning performance.<br />\nThe opposition, Baltimore Community College, fields an excellent team. Two years ago. BCC<br />\nparticipated in the NCAA baseball tournament at the junior college level. So for Coach Dennis<br />\nCox, the objective of the scrimmage was not so much geared to<br />\nwinning but to take a look at<br />\nnew personnel and returning men<br />\nwho saw little competition last<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"We wanted to get a look at<br />\nthose guys we don't know alot<br />\nabout,\" commented Coach Cox.<br />\n\"We wanted to find out what<br />\nthey could do in a competitive<br />\nsituation and what they had<br />\nlearned since the beginning of the<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nSouthpaw Paul Danker started<br />\nthe game for the Jays and except<br />\nfar some wildness in his first in-<br />\n<br />\nning did a fine job during his<br />\nthree inning stint. Sophomore<br />\nDennis Doherty came on in the<br />\nfourth inning but had control<br />\nproblems and was replaced by<br />\nace Blue Jay pitcher Billy Jones<br />\nafter one and two-thirds. Jones<br />\nhurled for the rest of the game.<br />\nBut pitching wasn't the Blue<br />\nJays biggest problem. Hopkins<br />\nhad its troubles defensively. All<br />\nof Baltimore CC's nine runs were<br />\nunearned. This basically was due<br />\nto the wave of inclement weather<br />\nthat has forced the Jays to practice inside. \"Defensively we still<br />\nneed a lot of work because we<br />\nhaven't been able to get outside.<br />\nPrior to the scrimmage we were<br />\nonly outside three times,\" commented Cox.<br />\nIn the offensive department,<br />\nHopkins fared a little better. Despite the fact that the Jays scored<br />\nno runs, many players hit the ball<br />\nwell. Jim Duffy, freshman Dave<br />\nLewing, and Lou Podrazik were<br />\namong those who made good<br />\ncontact with the ball against<br />\nBCC.<br />\n\"As far as hitting is concerned,<br />\nthe team is ahead of last year,\"<br />\nsaid Cox. \"Our players are more<br />\ncomfortable and confident at the<br />\nplate.\"<br />\nCurrently, there are twenty-<br />\n<br />\nfour players trying to grab a<br />\nstarting job on the squad. But<br />\nCoach Cox will only keep twenty<br />\non his roster requiring him to<br />\nmake another cut.<br />\n'We're experimenting with<br />\nsome personnel to find out what<br />\nthey can do. With the scrimmages<br />\nthis week and next, we should be<br />\nable to find the strongest possible<br />\nteam we can field:'<br />\n<br />\ncessful, although we did not blow<br />\nthem out.\" Indeed, although the<br />\nteam only scored six goals, it<br />\ndominated Gilman in 'ground<br />\nballs 60-44 and showed good defense, especially in the second<br />\nhalf. The latter is especially pleasing to Scroggs who feels that \"as<br />\nlong as we play good team defense and get the ground balls,<br />\nthe goals will come.\"<br />\nDefensive<br />\nDefense, indeed, seems to be<br />\nthis year's team's strength. Headed by sophomore Pete England, a<br />\ntransfer student who is ineligible<br />\nfor varsity competition, the defensive group includes Neil<br />\nSherman, Jack Deckelbaum,<br />\nScott Smith and Bernie Eisel,(all<br />\nsophs except Deckelbaum, a junior) and frosh Jim Condon and<br />\nJim Schoettler. At this point in<br />\nthe season, England, Deckelbaum<br />\nand Sherman seem to be the<br />\nprobable starters, though Smith<br />\nand Eisel will see a lot of action.<br />\nIn the mid-field lies the key to<br />\nthe season's fortunes. Led by<br />\nsophs Mike Rhodey, Dean \"the<br />\nDream\" Willis and Rob Zinkham,<br />\nthe middies have a lot of speed<br />\nand ability. Willis especially looked good in Tuesday's scrimmage,<br />\n<br />\nRich Hirsch<br />\nman defense. Also I wasn't completely pleased with Kevin<br />\nMahon's play in the nets. I<br />\nthought they hit on some shots<br />\nthey shouldn't have. On the<br />\nother hand, Jimmy Cahill's play<br />\nwas just great. He is playing his<br />\nbest since he's been here at Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe Jays will put their undefeated 3-0 pre-season mark on<br />\nthe line on Saturday when they<br />\nhost the Maryland Lacrosse Club<br />\nat 1:30 pm in their final _scrimmage of the year.<br />\n<br />\n'Eiports<br />\nRevenge on Homewood Field?<br />\nRevenge will be the tone of<br />\nthe day on Saturday afternoon,<br />\nMarch 22 when the defending<br />\nNCAA champion Hopkins lacrosse team steps out onto<br />\nHomewood Field in their opening contest, seeking to avenge last<br />\nyear's opening day upset loss to<br />\nthe University of Virginia.<br />\nThe Cavaliers will again pro-<br />\n<br />\nJV lacrosse team a contender<br />\nA part of the Johns Hopkins'<br />\nlacrosse effort that is often undernoticed and perhaps underrated by the Hopkins community is<br />\nits Junior Varsity lacrosse team.<br />\nThough designed primarily to<br />\ngive experience to those who otherwise would not play in the varsity's games, it practices and<br />\nworks as a separate team from<br />\nthe varsity. Furthermore, it touts<br />\na schedule that includes several<br />\npowerful community college and<br />\nJ.V. teams.<br />\nUnder the direction of Coach<br />\nWilliam \"Willie\" Scroggs, the<br />\nteam's outlook is bright, with a<br />\nlarge number of last year's team<br />\nreturning and several talented<br />\nstickmen added from the freshman class.<br />\nCoach Scroggs, when asked<br />\nabout the upcoming season, said<br />\nthat he looked forward to it being a \"successful\" one. Scroggs,<br />\nwho is in his third year as J.V.<br />\ncoach with two winning seasons<br />\nunder his belt, added that in his<br />\nmind \"success is not necessarily<br />\nwinning and losing games.\"<br />\nAs an example of his idea of<br />\nsuccess, Scroggs cited the team's<br />\nscrimmage aoinst Gilman H.S.<br />\nlast Tuesday. \"I felt we were suc-<br />\n<br />\nBeaver Draffen who scored most<br />\nof their goals.<br />\nFor the Jays, the highpoint<br />\nwas the sparkling play of sophomore attackman Rich Hirsch.<br />\nThe Plainview, Long Island native<br />\nscored nine goals (unofficially),<br />\nmost of which came in a five<br />\nminute span of the first half. The<br />\nplay of attackman Larry Leonard, especially on ground balls,<br />\nand the fine work of defenseman<br />\nDennis Gagamiros also drew raves<br />\nfrom Coach Henry Ciccarone.<br />\nThe Jays jumped to a 9-2 first<br />\nquarter lead, expanded that to<br />\n14-6 at the half and coasted the<br />\nrest of the way.<br />\nThe muddy condition of the<br />\nfield hampered the Jays ground<br />\nball play ancl)<br />\nmade the overall<br />\ncaliber of the play on both sides<br />\nvery sloppy.<br />\nThough generally pleased with<br />\nthe play of his' squad, Ciccarone<br />\nnoted, \"We could still stand for a<br />\nlot of improvement in our extra-<br />\n<br />\nwinning 13 out of 14 face-offs<br />\nand picking up 17 groundballs.<br />\nAlong with Rhodey, Willis and<br />\nZinkham, promising freshmen<br />\nBryan Chetalat, Jerry Faraino,<br />\nChuck Clarvit, Carl Yeich, Ron<br />\nNicola, Gary Windier, Bobby<br />\nGilroy and sophs Cushing<br />\nCondon and Mark Lewis round<br />\nout the midfield.<br />\nOn the scoring side of things,<br />\nthe attack is made up of junior<br />\nBob Fuhrman, sophomores Mark<br />\nPiasio, Paul Eberle, Scott Mellis<br />\nand frosh, Rowland Chen.

Thomas said also that his<br />\noffice has no figures on minority<br />\napplications as of now.<br />\nThe Admissions Director attributed the upward surge in applicants in the three fields to the<br />\nUniversity's participation in the<br />\nStudent Search Survey, which enables more students in the nonNatural Sciences areas to receive<br />\ninformation about Hopkins.<br /><br />\n\"Because of the student survey<br />\nin these three fields we were able<br />\nto give good exposure for students who would not have<br />\nthought of Hopkins,\" Thomas<br />\nstated.<br />\nQuantitative Scierices exhibited an increase of only one person<br />\nto 97, while those students listed<br />\nin the undecided category declined by over 100.<br />\nConcerning the entire applicant pool, Thomas noted that<br />\nthis year's increase is in part due<br />\nto an expanded travelling schedule by his office, as well as an<br />\neffort towards more personal<br />\ncontact.<br />\n\"Our traveling and visiting of<br />\nschools has had some effect.

The proposals stress<br />\nGoucher's continuing committment to the preparation of women for careers in the higher professions of law, medicine, teaching, and research.<br />\nThe suggested areas of emphasis include computer science, business economics, special education, journalism, and historical<br />\npreservation, public affairs, and<br />\nclinical psychology. A new degree program in dance is scheduled for implementation in September, 1975.<br />\nFiscal alterations have necessitated the reduction of the present academic program by approximately $200,000, while alloca-<br /><br />\ntions for new additions to the<br />\nthe termination of one full-time<br />\nprograms amount to $184,000. position in each of the departIf the plans are approved by<br />\nments of Education, English,<br />\nthe College Assembly, Goucher Mathematics, Philosophy, and<br />\nwill no longer offer majors in the Physical Education.

He said he realizes,<br />\nhowever, that he is attempting to<br />\novercome the triple disadvantage<br />\nof years of mismanagement, recent public cynicism towards<br />\ngovernment, and often hostile<br />\npress.<br />\n\"It's in the press itself,\" he declared. \"The writers are cynical<br />\nand they ought to be cynical. In<br />\nBaltimore County, the press<br />\nmissed the corruption completely. It took the Washington Post<br />\nto break the story of Baltimore<br />\nCounty corruption.\"<br />\n\"Because of that,\" he stated,<br />\n\"they \" have tried with a vengeance to kind of catch up.\"<br />\nHowever, he acknowledged<br />\nthat intensive interest in government, on the part of both the<br />\npublic and the press, is necessary<br />\ningredient in equitable<br />\ncrovernment.<br /><br />\nAfter a short declaration of<br />\nthe aims and purposes of his adVenetoulis opened the floor to<br />\nquestions from the audience.<br />\nOne listener seized the opportunity to inquire about the recent defeat of Venetoulis' nominee for the office of County Administrator, Jim Reed. The decision created many political undercurrents in Baltimore County<br />\nadministration. Venetoulis cited<br />\nhimself as the political catalyst<br />\nwhich caused Reed's eventual rejection for this office by the<br />\nBaltimore County Council. He<br />\nsaid that by proposing a largescale urban-renewal program several weeks before 'the nomination, he had given a right-wing<br />\nminority the chance to coalesce<br />\ninto a vocal political group.<br />\nUsing this as a starting point,<br />\nVenetoulis then launched into an<br />\nanimated discourse on the relationship between Baltimore<br />\nCounty administration and the<br />\nCouncil. \"To me, the biggest<br />\nproblem with the Council's behavior was that they violated a<br />\ntraditional executive-legislative<br />\nrelationship,\" he declared. \"By<br />\nthe violation, they caused great<br />\ngrief to the county.\"<br />\n\"I don't intend to let the<br />\nCouncil run the government,\" he<br />\nfurther asserted. \"I would be violating my own sense of responsibility if I did that.\"<br />\nHe did state, however, that<br />\none heartening aspect of the incident was the appearance of voluminous editorial support of<br />\nReed. He said this indicated that<br />\nthere is an increasing positive attitude in the county, which he<br />\nexpects to greatly aid him in his<br /><br />\nprogram of reform.<br /><br />\nTed Venetoulis<br /><br />\nIn response to a question on<br />\nBaltimore County and Baltimore<br />\nCity relationships, Venetoulis<br />\nstated that his administration<br />\nwould seek greater cooperation<br />\nbetween the two governmental<br />\nstructures than was previously<br />\nexhibited.<br />\nHe used as an example for this<br />\ncooperation the problem of<br />\ndredging the Baltimore City harbor and depositing the sludge on<br />\nHart Miller Island.<br />\nWhile he acknowledged the necessity of dredging the harbor to<br />\npreserve the economic base of<br />\nthe city, as an avowed environmentalist Venetoulis is opposed<br />\nto the dumping of the residue at<br /><br />\nthat location. Even though he<br />\nwas opposed to this action, he<br />\nwas concerned enough about<br />\nCounty-City relationships that he<br />\nrefused to participate on the panel reviewing the problem unless<br />\nMayor Schaeffer of Baltimore City was also present.<br />\nAfter further inquiries, Venetoulis strongly asserted that he is<br />\ncompletely opposed to any form<br />\nof merger between the city and<br />\ncounty governments. He feels<br />\nthat the main problem with government is that it is too centralized, bureaucratic, and unwieldy.<br />\n\"Democracy assumes a certain<br />\namount of inefficiency for the<br />\nrunning of government,\" he said.<br /><br />\nRhoda Dorsey<br />\nment in 1978-79.<br />\nGoucher officials maintain<br />\nthat the proposed changes reflect<br />\nthe College's effort to \"modernize and progress in order to meet<br />\nthe needs of contemporary women,\" but admit that the revisions were catalyzed by fiscal<br />\nconsiderations.<br />\nBillet said, \"In the 60's an institution could add to its program in a wholesale fashion without severe fiscal consequences.<br />\nThe expensive administrations of<br />\nthat era are no longer possible.<br />\nHard fiscal facts must be cast<br />\nagainst certain benefits.\"<br />\nHe asserted, \"We believe that<br />\nthere is a real need for our kind<br />\nof institution, therefore we must<br />\nchange to meet the academic and<br />\nfinancial criteria of the times. We<br />\nwill not only survive, but we will<br />\nremain great, because of<br />\nGoucher's capacity for change.\"<br />\nCollege Assembly meetings<br />\nwere held on both Monday and<br />\nWednesday of this week.

The referendum has been delayed until<br />\nsometime in late April.<br />\nThe good news is that the Student Council has launched a<br />\nnew committee to further modify the proctoring proposal<br />\ngiven by the old committee, whose suggestion was<br />\npronounced infeasible by those administrators affected by it.<br />\nDuring three weeks of deliberating and formulating a<br />\nproposal, the original committee failed to officially consult<br />\nDean Sigmund Suskind before making public their<br />\nsuggestion, which called for a major revision of the Dean's<br />\ncurrent role in arbitrating academic offenses. Thus, upon the<br />\nDean's disapproval, the panel had nothing to show for all its<br />\nextended deadlines and exhaustive investigation but an<br />\nuntenable proposal.<br />\nFollowing the acknowledged \"tactical blunder,\" the<br />\nCouncil voted this week to work the proposal into a form<br />\nacceptable to all concerned with the aid of a student-faculty<br />\ncommittee.

Without<br />\nemploying a narrator, the producers, by splicing together interviews with Americans and<br />\nVietnamese, along with clips of<br />\nspeeches by American politicians<br />\nand extensive footage of killing<br />\nand bombing, have succeeded in<br />\nputting forward a powerful message about ill-founded American<br />\nattitudes and the destruction and<br />\nsuffering they have caused (and are<br />\nstill causing).<br />\n\"Hearts and Minds\" pulls no<br />\npunches\u2014it literally numbs a viewer with a chilling account of what<br />\nthis war means at a basic human<br />\nlevel. Napalmed children, their<br />\ncharred skin hanging from their naked bodies, run screaming down a<br />\ndirt road away from their flaming<br />\nvillage. Several husky, fully equipped and uniformed G.I.'s take<br />\nturns 'interrogating' a skinny,<br />\nyouthful Vietnamese (a VC?), who<br />\nis clad only in a shirt and shorts. In<br />\nthis 'interrogation' the youth is<br />\nkicked repeatedly in the groin by<br />\nthe booted soldiers, and through<br />\nthe whole ordeal the frightened,<br />\nwincing youth's glazed eyes stare<br />\nstraight into the camera.<br />\nEven more gripping are the interviews with peasants who lived<br />\nthrough American bombing raids.<br />\nAn elderly, wrinkled woman relates that her home and village<br />\nwere devastated by bombs from an<br /><br />\nunseen plane (B-52). Gradually losing her composure, she explains<br />\n\"My sister is dead...I have no<br />\none...I have no home...nowhere to<br />\ngo...nothing to do.\" Then, for an<br />\ninterminable sixty seconds, she just<br />\ncries.<br />\nShow It To Your President<br />\nThe attitudes of the Vietnamese<br />\nabout the war come across eqully<br />\nclear. A South Vietnamese business<br />\nexecutive explains how he is planning to capitalize on the economic<br />\n\"take-off\" that will occur as soon<br />\nas the military situation stabilizes.<br />\nIt seems that other sectors of<br />\nVietnamese society have different<br />\nperspectives, however. A Saigon<br />\nshopkeeper confides\u2014\"The prcrblem is American imperialism\u2014this<br />\nis a war for national independence.\" A warehouse worker in the<br />\nSouth explains that the Saigon government is the biggest obstacle to<br />\npeace, and that the people are<br />\nafraid to speak out against it. A<br />\nCatholic priest puts the situation a<br />\nbit differently\u2014the Thieu regime is<br />\nthe opponent of peace and justice.<br />\nThey arrest and torture those who<br />\nspeak out for peace and freedom,<br />\nand brand them as communists. In<br />\ndoing so, they are defeating themselves, for they are teaching people<br />\nthat the communists are the forces<br />\nof peace and justice.<br />\nA peasant in the North is far less<br />\nanalytical. He explains that his village is isolated, and irately asks the<br />\ncameraman why the Americans<br />\nhave bombed it. He points to a pile<br />\nof rubble, and reveals that the bodies of his wife and daughter lie<br />\nthere. His voice cracking, he points<br />\nto another spot, saying that his<br /><br />\neight-year-old daughter was feeding<br />\nthe pigs there when the bombs \u2022<br />\nstruck. She died instantly. The<br />\nman's voice rises and breaks. He<br />\nwalks in circles, gesticulating wildly and raving at the camera-man.<br />\n\"What have we done to you<br />\nAmericans? Do we bomb your children?\".. He begins to sob as he<br />\npicks a tattered shirt out of the<br />\nrubble. \"Here\u2014this was my daughter's shirt. Look at it...take it back<br />\nto America...show it to your president...throw it in Nixon's face...<br />\n(screaming)...tell him he is the<br />\nmurderer of little girls!\"<br />\nNot only are Vietnamese attitudes revealed, but American attitudes are also given their fair share<br />\nof time. These are the attitudes<br />\nthat make senseless devastation<br />\npossible. An Air Force pilot relates<br />\nthe satisfaction he feels upon completing a successful bombing mission. He sees himself not as a killer<br />\nbut as a 'skilled technician'. A father of a dead Vietnam vet, when<br />\nasked if he felt if his son's death<br />\nwas for a worthwhile cause, replies: \"Americans are taught to<br />\nobey their government. When we<br />\nare called upon, we have an obliga-<br /><br />\ntion to obey. I believe in our President...I believe he did what he had<br />\nto do...\" John Foster Dulles reveals<br />\nthat communism is a growing cancer that must be halted before it<br />\nspreads. But a young co-ed demurs,<br />\nexplaining: \"I'm only interested in<br />\nwhat affects me the most\".<br />\nScene: a coffin is draped with a<br />\nSouth Vietnamese flag. Two young<br />\nboys stand in front of it, wailing,<br />\none holding a portrait of his dead<br />\nfather in his hands, the other beating his fists and head upon the coffin. Their mother stands by, sobbing quietly. Six military pall-bearers pick up the coffin and carry it<br />\nout to a field. The children wail<br />\neven more loudly, following closely and looking alternately at their<br />\nfather's portrait and the coffin. As<br />\nthe box is lowered into the grave,<br />\nthe mother breaks down, wailing<br />\nand talking incoherently, and tries<br />\nto climb into the grave with her<br />\ndead husband. She struggles with<br />\nthe pall-bearers who pull her out of<br />\nthe gave, and finally gives up, staring silently at the dirt being<br />\nthrown over the casket.<br />\nNext Scene: the edge of a peaceful lake. General Westmoreland,<br /><br />\ncommander of the U.S. forces<br />\nfrom 1964-68, explains smugly:<br />\n\"You have to understand...the<br />\nOriental does not place as high a<br />\nvalue on human life as we do.\"<br />\nThe message of the film is.conveyed in the final few scenes<br />\n\u2014Americans have tried hard not to<br />\nlearn from their Vietnam experience.<br />\n...A parade. A banner proclaiming \"Citizens for Victory in<br />\nVietnam\". Hardhats, tatoos, boy<br />\nscouts, American flags. On the<br />\nsidewalk,jeering\u2014the VVAW. Pickets declaring \"Peace Without Honor\". The paraders turn and sneer at<br />\nthe pickets. They swear at them<br />\nand flip them the bird. The police<br />\nmove in, violence ensues, bloodied<br />\nprotesters are hauled into police<br />\nwagons. One of the protesting veterans avoids the police and seeks<br />\nout the camera amidst the confusion. \"What the hell is this?\", he<br />\npleads, \"We were there, we fought<br />\nthere, we know what it's all about.<br />\nWhy won't they listen?\"<br />\n\"Hearts and Minds\" deserves<br />\nmore than the academy award it<br />\nhas been nominated for\u2014it deserves to be seen.<br /><br />\nAnd in this corner we have jazz<br />\nBy J.D.

to<br />\nBaltimore at the Painter's Mill Music Fair, critics say he's the \"second coming\" of that Minnesota<br />\nenigma, but he knows better than<br />\nthat, he makes up lines that rhyme<br />\nthree times in a row, (\"Madman<br />\ndrummers bummers and Indians in<br />\nthe summer\") sings about Seaside<br />\nbars buried in the \"swamps of<br />\nJersey\" and he's got a reputation<br />\nfor flashing on the stage, dying<br />\nonce or twice for his own pleasure,<br />\nand it looks like another sellout<br />\nperformance.<br />\nThe crowd's impatient waiting<br />\nfor the emerging Prince, they're tired of walking up slanted floors to<br />\nthe bar, stepping heavy on each<br />\nother's fingers, Painter's Mill is<br />\nstuffed, (to the hilt! to the hilt!)<br />\nit's a small hall, but the music<br />\nsounds right, spotlight on<br />\nSpringsteen as he takes the stage,<br />\nhe's already got the audience with<br />\nhim, and he winks to the chick in<br />\nthe back who duplicates his dance<br />\nto the front, pointing her violin to<br />\nthe side, she nods her head and<br />\nSpringsteen grabs the mike, he<br />\nstarts to suffer and sings: \"Spanish<br />\nJohnny drove in from the underworld last.night.\"<br />\nCrazy Janey and her Mission Man<br />\nAs the song ends, the crowd<br />\ncries as Springsteen snickers in the<br />\nblue lights, and the E Street Band<br /><br />\ncomes marching to their own time,<br />\nhuddles with the bashful Prince,<br />\nand somebody's yelling to the saxophonist, \"Hey Clarence, I think<br />\nyou play real fine, we'll play basketball some time, and take the<br />\ngirls out for a climb, over that distant Jersey border\" and everybody's smiling as the band swings<br />\ninto \"Spirit in the Night,\" they<br />\nplay the same songs all the time<br />\nbut no one seems to mind;'cause<br />\nthey got the power of a group verging on superstardom, afid they all<br />\nknow it, that's why they laugh<br />\nwhen Springsteen growls, \"Crazy<br />\nJane and her mission man were<br />\nback in the alley tradin' hands...<br />\njust like spirits in the night.\"<br />\nAnd so the highlights come and<br />\ngo, the audience is clapping with<br />\nthe band, as the swirling Prince<br />\nlands on his toes, screaming to the<br />\nceiling, bathing in the blue and<br />\ngreen glows, with a her's gleam he<br />\nlooks to the certter row, where he<br />\nduels with a mock monk made up<br />\nfor the show, everybody knows it's<br />\nthe final time in the Painter's Mill<br />\nfor Springsteen and his band, it's<br />\ntoo small to hold them, but right<br />\nnow it's \"spirits in the night, all<br />\nnight, every night.\"<br />\nAnd just when the music starts<br />\nto lull, too much excitement can<br />\nbe deceptively dull, Clarence takes<br />\na bow, steps to the mike, says<br />\n\"Hey, I got somethin' to spill,\"<br />\nand the crowd leans toward the<br /><br />\nstage as Clarence whispers \"Kitty's<br />\nback,\" all eyes turn to the writhing<br />\nPrince, who's been alone on the<br />\nside, and he moves to the front,<br />\nbouncing with his tale of low life<br />\nmuscle, harlots in the back seat,<br />\nhe's so fast, he's so sly, pacing the<br />\nstage as the band builds and builds,<br />\n\"Here she comes, here she comes,<br />\nhere she comes\" and explodes<br />\n\"KITTY'S BACK IN TOWN<br />\nKitty's back in town.\"<br />\nSpringsteen settles back into the<br />\nrest of his routine, playing guitar<br />\nand looking half as mean as the<br />\nmodel of his stories, and he races<br />\nuntil the end, says that he's doing<br />\n\"Rosalita\" with special care, the<br />\ncrowd goes wild and soon everyone's waiting for the encore.<br />\nThe triumphant Prince returns<br />\nto the stage, runs through two<br />\nmore songs and is out for the<br />\nnight, leaving half the people in the<br />\nhall feeling like they've been part<br />\nof an event, someone said it was<br />\neven kind of holy, and Springsteen<br />\nkeeps touring with his band, playing every city and creating a base<br />\nof fans, he's been singing all these<br />\nyears and now he's about to dominate rock and roll, but that's never<br />\nbeen his goal, he'd just as soon<br />\nstand under a streetlight, throwing<br />\npebbles, starting a fight, doesn't<br />\ncare if

Discussion<br />\nregarding the creation of a lottery system began in April of last year. Much time<br />\nand effort has gone into the development of the lottery. It is felt that through this<br />\nsystem assignment of vacant spaces in these facilities will be accomplished in the<br />\nfairest possible manner.<br />\nA series of seven lottery drawings will be used to assign vacant spaces in<br />\nthese two buildings for the 1975/76 academic year. Each one.of the seven lottery<br />\ndrawings has been designed to make assignments by the number of vacancies in an<br />\napartment in each building. Lottery drawings will be held over a period of 8 days<br />\nallowing those students not selected in one drawing the opportunity to decide whether<br />\nthey desire to enter a subsequent drawing.

Despite the<br />\ndecrease, the annual giving office<br />\nsaid that more money has been<br />\ncontributed this year than last<br />\nyear at this time.<br />\nThe phonathon was initiated<br />\nlast year by Cover. However, its<br />\nsuccess was limited due to the<br />\nsmall turnout of volunteers to<br />\nman the telephones.<br />\nCover, however, said that this<br />\nyear more than two hundred<br />\nalumni and friends of alumni will<br />\nman the phones. He also said he<br />\nhopes to include members pf the<br />\nuniversity community in it.<br />\n\"I's like to see the phonathon<br />\ninvolve as many segments of the<br /><br />\nuniversity as possible. We'd like<br />\nto have students involved in any<br />\nway possible,\" Cover said.<br />\nCover indicated that several<br />\nundergraduate campus organizations have already promised to<br />\nenlist the support of some of<br />\ntheir members.<br />\nCovers also stated that the idea<br />\nof the phonathon would spur<br />\nalumni interest in Hopkins. Cover<br />\nnoted that many alumni still have<br />\nbad feelings toward Hopkins as a<br />\nresult of the riots and demonstrations on the ca. mpus during the<br />\nlate 1960's. By enlisting student<br />\nand alumni help for the phonathon. Cover hopes to erase this<br /><br />\nimage of Hopkins in the minds of<br />\nsome of.the alumni.<br />\n\"Basically the phonathon is to<br />\ncommunicate, to let the alumni<br />\nknow what things are growing at<br />\nHopkins,\" Cover said.<br />\nThe.phonathon is a commonly<br />\nused means of soliciiting funds<br />\nfor alumni throughout alunni offices in the United States. Cover<br />\nsaid that the phonathon will<br />\nprove successful this year, as it<br />\nhas for other colleges across the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nStudents who wish to participate can contact Cover in the<br />\nSteinwald Alumni House on<br />\nCharles Street.<br /><br />\nAFT )A1-1-1$1&lt;[LLAZ,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nNelson Cover<br /><br />\nCJICC-1E110<br />\n2:00 P.M.<br />\nLOOK AND LISTEN ROOM<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nA SERIES OF FOUR SUNDAY AFTERNOON FILMS<br />\nDEPICTING AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF<br />\nSOCIETY'S ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE DISABLED.<br /><br />\n\u2022 111-11-11E<br /><br />\n5AT mg<br />\ny)1[WC An55ioN<br />\n-ME BUR<br /><br />\nItJ IlL II SIT7 CLASS<br /><br />\n\u2022 March 16, 1975<br />\n\\ This stylishly brilliant and imaginative satirical comedy, starring Peter O'Toole, portrays the transformation of the 14th Earl of Gurney from a good-hearted madman, just released from a mental institution, into a neat, repressed, respectable peer with a distasteful, bloodthirsty personality.(1973)<br /><br />\n-ON<br /><br />\nNu0tel45- BRING<br /><br />\n\u2022 Presented by The Chaplain's Office, The Johns Hopkins University and the Kennedy Institute<br />\nfor Handicapped<br />\nChildren.

The scrimmage<br />\nbetween Hobart and Hopkins was<br />\noriginally scheduled for<br />\nWednesday, but heavy rain cancelled it.<br />\nHobart which is in town to<br />\nscrimmage University of Balt-<br /><br />\nimore and Morgan State, stayed<br />\nover and the scrimmage was played on Thursday. The game ended<br />\njust prior to press time and final<br />\nstatistics were unavailable, but<br />\nthe score at the end of regulation<br />\ntime stood at approximately 22-9<br />\nwith the Jays on the long end.<br />\nHobart finished second to<br />\nTowson State in the College Division last year and the Blue Jays<br /><br />\nwere looking for a, tough hardfought scrimmage from a fast and<br />\nphysical team. Instead they<br />\ntrounced an inferior opponent<br />\nwhcse main characteristic were<br />\nsloppy gound-ball play and a<br />\ngambling, pressing defense which<br />\ngot burned many times. Their<br />\noffense was almost non-existent<br />\nwith what little there was of it<br />\nprovided by All-American middie<br /><br />\nDiamondmen drop opener, 9-0<br />\nBy ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nThe Hopkins baseball team got<br />\nits first taste of intercollegiate<br />\ncompetition Tuesday as they<br />\nchallenged the diarnondmen of the<br />\nCommunity College of Baltimore. The Blue Jays didn't fare<br />\ntoo well, dropping the seven inning contest by the score of 9-0.<br />\nFor Hopkins, the purpose of<br />\nthe scrimmage, their first this<br />\nspring, was not to necessarily<br />\nturn in a winning performance.<br />\nThe opposition, Baltimore Community College, fields an excellent team. Two years ago. BCC<br />\nparticipated in the NCAA baseball tournament at the junior college level. So for Coach Dennis<br />\nCox, the objective of the scrimmage was not so much geared to<br />\nwinning but to take a look at<br />\nnew personnel and returning men<br />\nwho saw little competition last<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"We wanted to get a look at<br />\nthose guys we don't know alot<br />\nabout,\" commented Coach Cox.<br />\n\"We wanted to find out what<br />\nthey could do in a competitive<br />\nsituation and what they had<br />\nlearned since the beginning of the<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nSouthpaw Paul Danker started<br />\nthe game for the Jays and except<br />\nfar some wildness in his first in-<br /><br />\nning did a fine job during his<br />\nthree inning stint. Sophomore<br />\nDennis Doherty came on in the<br />\nfourth inning but had control<br />\nproblems and was replaced by<br />\nace Blue Jay pitcher Billy Jones<br />\nafter one and two-thirds. Jones<br />\nhurled for the rest of the game.<br />\nBut pitching wasn't the Blue<br />\nJays biggest problem. Hopkins<br />\nhad its troubles defensively. All<br />\nof Baltimore CC's nine runs were<br />\nunearned. This basically was due<br />\nto the wave of inclement weather<br />\nthat has forced the Jays to practice inside. \"Defensively we still<br />\nneed a lot of work because we<br />\nhaven't been able to get outside.<br />\nPrior to the scrimmage we were<br />\nonly outside three times,\" commented Cox.<br />\nIn the offensive department,<br />\nHopkins fared a little better. Despite the fact that the Jays scored<br />\nno runs, many players hit the ball<br />\nwell. Jim Duffy, freshman Dave<br />\nLewing, and Lou Podrazik were<br />\namong those who made good<br />\ncontact with the ball against<br />\nBCC.<br />\n\"As far as hitting is concerned,<br />\nthe team is ahead of last year,\"<br />\nsaid Cox. \"Our players are more<br />\ncomfortable and confident at the<br />\nplate.\"<br />\nCurrently, there are twenty-<br /><br />\nfour players trying to grab a<br />\nstarting job on the squad. But<br />\nCoach Cox will only keep twenty<br />\non his roster requiring him to<br />\nmake another cut.<br />\n'We're experimenting with<br />\nsome personnel to find out what<br />\nthey can do. With the scrimmages<br />\nthis week and next, we should be<br />\nable to find the strongest possible<br />\nteam we can field:'<br /><br />\ncessful, although we did not blow<br />\nthem out.\" Indeed, although the<br />\nteam only scored six goals, it<br />\ndominated Gilman in 'ground<br />\nballs 60-44 and showed good defense, especially in the second<br />\nhalf. The latter is especially pleasing to Scroggs who feels that \"as<br />\nlong as we play good team defense and get the ground balls,<br />\nthe goals will come.\"<br />\nDefensive<br />\nDefense, indeed, seems to be<br />\nthis year's team's strength. Headed by sophomore Pete England, a<br />\ntransfer student who is ineligible<br />\nfor varsity competition, the defensive group includes Neil<br />\nSherman, Jack Deckelbaum,<br />\nScott Smith and Bernie Eisel,(all<br />\nsophs except Deckelbaum, a junior) and frosh Jim Condon and<br />\nJim Schoettler. At this point in<br />\nthe season, England, Deckelbaum<br />\nand Sherman seem to be the<br />\nprobable starters, though Smith<br />\nand Eisel will see a lot of action.<br />\nIn the mid-field lies the key to<br />\nthe season's fortunes. Led by<br />\nsophs Mike Rhodey, Dean \"the<br />\nDream\" Willis and Rob Zinkham,<br />\nthe middies have a lot of speed<br />\nand ability. Willis especially looked good in Tuesday's scrimmage,<br /><br />\nRich Hirsch<br />\nman defense. Also I wasn't completely pleased with Kevin<br />\nMahon's play in the nets. I<br />\nthought they hit on some shots<br />\nthey shouldn't have. On the<br />\nother hand, Jimmy Cahill's play<br />\nwas just great. He is playing his<br />\nbest since he's been here at Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe Jays will put their undefeated 3-0 pre-season mark on<br />\nthe line on Saturday when they<br />\nhost the Maryland Lacrosse Club<br />\nat 1:30 pm in their final _scrimmage of the year.<br /><br />\n'Eiports<br />\nRevenge on Homewood Field?<br />\nRevenge will be the tone of<br />\nthe day on Saturday afternoon,<br />\nMarch 22 when the defending<br />\nNCAA champion Hopkins lacrosse team steps out onto<br />\nHomewood Field in their opening contest, seeking to avenge last<br />\nyear's opening day upset loss to<br />\nthe University of Virginia.<br />\nThe Cavaliers will again pro-<br /><br />\nJV lacrosse team a contender<br />\nA part of the Johns Hopkins'<br />\nlacrosse effort that is often undernoticed and perhaps underrated by the Hopkins community is<br />\nits Junior Varsity lacrosse team.<br />\nThough designed primarily to<br />\ngive experience to those who otherwise would not play in the varsity's games, it practices and<br />\nworks as a separate team from<br />\nthe varsity. Furthermore, it touts<br />\na schedule that includes several<br />\npowerful community college and<br />\nJ.V. teams.<br />\nUnder the direction of Coach<br />\nWilliam \"Willie\" Scroggs, the<br />\nteam's outlook is bright, with a<br />\nlarge number of last year's team<br />\nreturning and several talented<br />\nstickmen added from the freshman class.<br />\nCoach Scroggs, when asked<br />\nabout the upcoming season, said<br />\nthat he looked forward to it being a \"successful\" one. Scroggs,<br />\nwho is in his third year as J.V.<br />\ncoach with two winning seasons<br />\nunder his belt, added that in his<br />\nmind \"success is not necessarily<br />\nwinning and losing games.\"<br />\nAs an example of his idea of<br />\nsuccess, Scroggs cited the team's<br />\nscrimmage aoinst Gilman H.S.<br />\nlast Tuesday. \"I felt we were suc-<br /><br />\nBeaver Draffen who scored most<br />\nof their goals.<br />\nFor the Jays, the highpoint<br />\nwas the sparkling play of sophomore attackman Rich Hirsch.<br />\nThe Plainview, Long Island native<br />\nscored nine goals (unofficially),<br />\nmost of which came in a five<br />\nminute span of the first half. The<br />\nplay of attackman Larry Leonard, especially on ground balls,<br />\nand the fine work of defenseman<br />\nDennis Gagamiros also drew raves<br />\nfrom Coach Henry Ciccarone.<br />\nThe Jays jumped to a 9-2 first<br />\nquarter lead, expanded that to<br />\n14-6 at the half and coasted the<br />\nrest of the way.<br />\nThe muddy condition of the<br />\nfield hampered the Jays ground<br />\nball play ancl)<br />\nmade the overall<br />\ncaliber of the play on both sides<br />\nvery sloppy.<br />\nThough generally pleased with<br />\nthe play of his' squad, Ciccarone<br />\nnoted, \"We could still stand for a<br />\nlot of improvement in our extra-<br /><br />\nwinning 13 out of 14 face-offs<br />\nand picking up 17 groundballs.<br />\nAlong with Rhodey, Willis and<br />\nZinkham, promising freshmen<br />\nBryan Chetalat, Jerry Faraino,<br />\nChuck Clarvit, Carl Yeich, Ron<br />\nNicola, Gary Windier, Bobby<br />\nGilroy and sophs Cushing<br />\nCondon and Mark Lewis round<br />\nout the midfield.<br />\nOn the scoring side of things,<br />\nthe attack is made up of junior<br />\nBob Fuhrman, sophomores Mark<br />\nPiasio, Paul Eberle, Scott Mellis<br />\nand frosh, Rowland Chen. This is<br />\nthe most inexperienced part of<br />\nthe team with all five having had<br />\nlittle or no high school experience. To make up for this, Mr.<br />\nScroggs has experimented with<br />\nthe idea of an \"attack7midfielder\", running some midfielders at<br />\nattack.
