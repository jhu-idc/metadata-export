With<br />\nthe exception of the New Jersey AllStars and, possibly one or two other<br />\nintramural teams, the organizations<br />\nare not well-knit.<br />\nIt seems strange that there can be<br />\nfound no ties of occupational loyalty<br />\nupon which to build intramural athletic competition when every AntiWar Strike reveals so plainly the<br />\nbreach between the engineers and the<br />\nA.B. men. It might not be a bad idea<br />\nto have an engineer's league, the<br />\nteams to fight for the honor of meeting the winner of an A.B. league and<br />\nbusiness league combined. In that<br />\nway some sort of continuity might<br />\nbe inserted into the system. Plaques<br />\nmight be offered to the winner of<br />\neach league and a trophy to the college with the highest total of points<br />\nin intercollege competition within the University, all awards to be<br />\ndisplayed in the office of the dean<br />\nof the winning college\u2014arts or business or engineers. A college would<br />\nhave to win three legs on the trophy<br />\nto get permanent possession of it. In<br />\nsuch a fashion tradition may be<br />\nstarted and the intramural league be<br />\nbuilt up as intercollege leagues.<br />\n0\u20140<br />\n<br />\nCriticism Of<br />\nThe Plan<br />\nPerhaps the chief objection to the<br />\nplan I outlined above lies on ethical<br />\ngrounds. It may be argued that there<br />\nis already entirely too big a rupture<br />\nin the relations of. the engineers and<br />\nthe art.'s men. Since they take different courses in different sections of<br />\nthe campus for the most part, and<br />\nsince they even segregate in the matter of fraternities, the two sets of<br />\nmen have little to do with, one another. I think that the problem oT<br />\nmaking these two units realize that<br />\nthey are each a part of a single institution that stands out in the academic world\u2014in any world, for that<br />\nmatter\u2014as the epitome of the scientific attitude of open-mindedness and<br />\nof thorough investigation of facts, T.<br />\nthink that this problem is not beneath the consideration of the highest administrators at the Hopkins<br />\nFollowing that line, it may be<br />\npointed out that I would act upon<br />\nthe distinctions that already exist,<br />\nand would construct an even larger<br />\nbarrier between the two groups. I<br />\ncan't agree with that. As I see it,<br />\nthe source of the trouble is the lack<br />\nof contact between the engineers and<br />\nthe arts men. Playing football<br />\nagainst one another would certainly<br />\nbring them into close contact\u2014in<br />\nmore than one way. When men meet<br />\nmen they didn't know well before in<br />\nsome game like football, they usually<br />\nget a new respect for them. I believe that this has been the case with<br />\nthe fraternities. Speaking as a fraternity man I can say that we have<br />\nyet to meet a team whose men we<br />\ndidn't think more of after playing<br />\nthem for the courage and sportsmanship they showed.<br />\n<br />\nFought Tilt; Alpha Delts Wins Award For Interfrat<br />\nWin In Frat League Race<br />\nAthletic<br />\nChampionship;<br />\nLeads<br />\nWith<br />\n330 Points<br />\nIn a closely-contested interclass<br />\n<br />\nTo Renew Cross-Country<br />\nFeud; Close Race Seen<br />\nThe Hopkins cross-country team<br />\nwill inaugurate its season tomorrow when it travels to Bethlehem,<br />\nPa., to engage the Lehigh harriers.<br />\nThe run will mark the first competition between the squads in the sport<br />\nsince 1931.<br />\nAccording to past results, a hardfought battle should be waged.

With<br />\nthe exception of the New Jersey AllStars and, possibly one or two other<br />\nintramural teams, the organizations<br />\nare not well-knit.<br />\nIt seems strange that there can be<br />\nfound no ties of occupational loyalty<br />\nupon which to build intramural athletic competition when every AntiWar Strike reveals so plainly the<br />\nbreach between the engineers and the<br />\nA.B. men. It might not be a bad idea<br />\nto have an engineer's league, the<br />\nteams to fight for the honor of meeting the winner of an A.B. league and<br />\nbusiness league combined. In that<br />\nway some sort of continuity might<br />\nbe inserted into the system. Plaques<br />\nmight be offered to the winner of<br />\neach league and a trophy to the college with the highest total of points<br />\nin intercollege competition within the University, all awards to be<br />\ndisplayed in the office of the dean<br />\nof the winning college\u2014arts or business or engineers. A college would<br />\nhave to win three legs on the trophy<br />\nto get permanent possession of it. In<br />\nsuch a fashion tradition may be<br />\nstarted and the intramural league be<br />\nbuilt up as intercollege leagues.<br />\n0\u20140<br /><br />\nCriticism Of<br />\nThe Plan<br />\nPerhaps the chief objection to the<br />\nplan I outlined above lies on ethical<br />\ngrounds. It may be argued that there<br />\nis already entirely too big a rupture<br />\nin the relations of. the engineers and<br />\nthe art.'s men. Since they take different courses in different sections of<br />\nthe campus for the most part, and<br />\nsince they even segregate in the matter of fraternities, the two sets of<br />\nmen have little to do with, one another. I think that the problem oT<br />\nmaking these two units realize that<br />\nthey are each a part of a single institution that stands out in the academic world\u2014in any world, for that<br />\nmatter\u2014as the epitome of the scientific attitude of open-mindedness and<br />\nof thorough investigation of facts, T.<br />\nthink that this problem is not beneath the consideration of the highest administrators at the Hopkins<br />\nFollowing that line, it may be<br />\npointed out that I would act upon<br />\nthe distinctions that already exist,<br />\nand would construct an even larger<br />\nbarrier between the two groups. I<br />\ncan't agree with that. As I see it,<br />\nthe source of the trouble is the lack<br />\nof contact between the engineers and<br />\nthe arts men. Playing football<br />\nagainst one another would certainly<br />\nbring them into close contact\u2014in<br />\nmore than one way. When men meet<br />\nmen they didn't know well before in<br />\nsome game like football, they usually<br />\nget a new respect for them. I believe that this has been the case with<br />\nthe fraternities. Speaking as a fraternity man I can say that we have<br />\nyet to meet a team whose men we<br />\ndidn't think more of after playing<br />\nthem for the courage and sportsmanship they showed.<br /><br />\nFought Tilt; Alpha Delts Wins Award For Interfrat<br />\nWin In Frat League Race<br />\nAthletic<br />\nChampionship;<br />\nLeads<br />\nWith<br />\n330 Points<br />\nIn a closely-contested interclass<br /><br />\nTo Renew Cross-Country<br />\nFeud; Close Race Seen<br />\nThe Hopkins cross-country team<br />\nwill inaugurate its season tomorrow when it travels to Bethlehem,<br />\nPa., to engage the Lehigh harriers.<br />\nThe run will mark the first competition between the squads in the sport<br />\nsince 1931.<br />\nAccording to past results, a hardfought battle should be waged.
