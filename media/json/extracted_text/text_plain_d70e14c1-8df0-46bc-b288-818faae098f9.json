Clarke of Johns Hopkins University had lowered the world's record for the one hundred yard<br />\ndash indoors, by running that distance in nine and four-fifths seconds.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has had in its history teams to be proud of,<br />\nteams that have given the largest universities in the country a \"run<br />\nfor their money. To the best of our knowledge, however, this is the<br />\nfirst time that Hopkins has been able to claim a world's champion.<br />\nThe remarkable race which Clarke ran on Saturday night not only<br />\nbroadcasted the name of Hopkins far and wide but made the victor<br />\na practical certainty for the Olympic games to be held next summer. It seems feasible to predict that a man who can run one hundred yards in nine and four-fifths seconds indoors will be able to<br />\ntake something off of this mark on a fast cinder track. Clarke, in<br />\nall probability, will have a chance to advertise Hopkins' undergraduate activities on the Eastern Hemisphere.<br />\nToo much credit cannot be given to Verne Booth, the Black<br />\nand Blue captain, for the exhibition of stamina and grit which he<br />\ngay.e in capturing the gruelling five thousand metre run. Booth, who<br />\nwas recovering from a recent illness, started from scratch, ran a<br />\nheady race, and did not stop until he had overtaken and passed some<br />\nof the best distance runners of the East. Booth did not break any<br />\nworld's records but he delighted the spectators by his showing of<br />\nMay we hope that Clarke's achievement will result in the elimination of a few more of the \"oh, you're studying medicine\" people.<br />\nTHE FRESHMAN-SOPHOMORE RUSH<br />\nColleges throughout the East are announcing the partial elimination or total abandonment of freshman regulations and lower<br />\nclass \"scraps.\" We have expressed our opinion on this subject too<br />\noften to repeat. Freshman regulations, such as are in effect at Hopkins, seem necessary to bring the first-year man down to earth,<br />\nto inform him of the fact the globe is populated by others besides himself, and to notify him that he is not really quite as good as he thinks<br />\nhe is.<br />\nWe would suggest, however, a modification of the annual lowerclass rush. Hopkins has been fortunate in the past in not having<br />\nhad any serious injuries as the result of this classic. Medical men,<br />\nwho viewed the tussle last December, however, expressed surprise<br />\nat the fact that no injuries of consequence had issued from this socalled organized assault. They emphasized the danger involved and<br />\nsuggested that some other means be found to test the skill and<br />\nprowess of the rival classes.<br />\nIt is an unfortunate feature of such affairs that it is not until<br />\nsome serious accident has occurred that the danger and futility are<br />\nrealized. Some December a freshman or sophomore will slip, a<br />\nmass of bodies will close over him, the student referees will not notice him or will find it impossible to remove the uppermost portions<br />\nof the pile and a tragedy will have resulted. And then a mighty cry<br />\nwill arise to abolish inter-class struggles.<br />\nSuch an occurrence, though it may seem only a vague possibility, would prove most unfortunate for the university as well as for<br />\nthe victim. We would suggest that next year's Student Council<br />\neliminate all chances for such a mishap by modifying the annual rush.<br />\n<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\n<br />\nDR.<br />\n<br />\nA Class Distinction<br />\nThe Hinge-Cap is the insignia of Williams<br />\nShaving Cream and of Williams only.<br />\nYou'll notice three things about Williams<br />\nevery time you shave. 1.

Clarke of Johns Hopkins University had lowered the world's record for the one hundred yard<br />\ndash indoors, by running that distance in nine and four-fifths seconds.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has had in its history teams to be proud of,<br />\nteams that have given the largest universities in the country a \"run<br />\nfor their money. To the best of our knowledge, however, this is the<br />\nfirst time that Hopkins has been able to claim a world's champion.<br />\nThe remarkable race which Clarke ran on Saturday night not only<br />\nbroadcasted the name of Hopkins far and wide but made the victor<br />\na practical certainty for the Olympic games to be held next summer. It seems feasible to predict that a man who can run one hundred yards in nine and four-fifths seconds indoors will be able to<br />\ntake something off of this mark on a fast cinder track. Clarke, in<br />\nall probability, will have a chance to advertise Hopkins' undergraduate activities on the Eastern Hemisphere.<br />\nToo much credit cannot be given to Verne Booth, the Black<br />\nand Blue captain, for the exhibition of stamina and grit which he<br />\ngay.e in capturing the gruelling five thousand metre run. Booth, who<br />\nwas recovering from a recent illness, started from scratch, ran a<br />\nheady race, and did not stop until he had overtaken and passed some<br />\nof the best distance runners of the East. Booth did not break any<br />\nworld's records but he delighted the spectators by his showing of<br />\nMay we hope that Clarke's achievement will result in the elimination of a few more of the \"oh, you're studying medicine\" people.<br />\nTHE FRESHMAN-SOPHOMORE RUSH<br />\nColleges throughout the East are announcing the partial elimination or total abandonment of freshman regulations and lower<br />\nclass \"scraps.\" We have expressed our opinion on this subject too<br />\noften to repeat. Freshman regulations, such as are in effect at Hopkins, seem necessary to bring the first-year man down to earth,<br />\nto inform him of the fact the globe is populated by others besides himself, and to notify him that he is not really quite as good as he thinks<br />\nhe is.<br />\nWe would suggest, however, a modification of the annual lowerclass rush. Hopkins has been fortunate in the past in not having<br />\nhad any serious injuries as the result of this classic. Medical men,<br />\nwho viewed the tussle last December, however, expressed surprise<br />\nat the fact that no injuries of consequence had issued from this socalled organized assault. They emphasized the danger involved and<br />\nsuggested that some other means be found to test the skill and<br />\nprowess of the rival classes.<br />\nIt is an unfortunate feature of such affairs that it is not until<br />\nsome serious accident has occurred that the danger and futility are<br />\nrealized. Some December a freshman or sophomore will slip, a<br />\nmass of bodies will close over him, the student referees will not notice him or will find it impossible to remove the uppermost portions<br />\nof the pile and a tragedy will have resulted. And then a mighty cry<br />\nwill arise to abolish inter-class struggles.<br />\nSuch an occurrence, though it may seem only a vague possibility, would prove most unfortunate for the university as well as for<br />\nthe victim. We would suggest that next year's Student Council<br />\neliminate all chances for such a mishap by modifying the annual rush.<br /><br />\nContinued from page 1<br /><br />\nDR.<br /><br />\nA Class Distinction<br />\nThe Hinge-Cap is the insignia of Williams<br />\nShaving Cream and of Williams only.<br />\nYou'll notice three things about Williams<br />\nevery time you shave. 1.
