In formulating the<br />\nincrease, Dean Hall said that<br />\nconsideration was given not only<br />\nto the needs of those students<br />\nalready enrolled at Johns Hopkins, but also to those of the<br />\nprospective freshman class.<br />\nThis coming year's increase<br />\nrepresents a smaller percentage<br />\nincrease than last year's, which<br />\n<br />\nwas in excess of 15 percent.<br />\nHall also stated that Johns<br />\nHopkins' proposed tuition hike<br />\nis \"in the ballpark\" with many<br />\nother schools of its type, which<br />\nhe said are planning tuition<br />\nincreases of 10 to 15 percent in<br />\nthe coming year.<br />\nHall also said that the<br />\nUniversity dollar content of<br />\nmany existing financial aid<br />\npackages would also rise, but he<br />\nwas unsure what the net effect<br />\nof such increases would be. In<br />\nterms of outside aid, Hall said,<br />\n\"We won't know how much<br />\nmoney we will be getting from<br />\nthe Federal Government until<br />\nthe mid-summer.\"<br />\nThe proposed tuition increase will go to the University<br />\ntrustees for approval on Feb. 22.<br />\nlie said that questions about the<br />\n*Reagan budget for the 1983<br />\nfiscal year caused a delay in<br />\nannouncing next year's tuition<br />\n<br />\nAssembly Plans To Raise Drinking Age<br />\nBY DIANA NEWMAN<br />\nThe legal drinking age in<br />\nMaryland for wine and beer will<br />\nmost likely change before the<br />\nstate legislature finishes its present term in late February.<br />\nThe House of D 'gates is<br />\nscheduled to vote on the issue<br />\nsometime in the near future.<br />\nThere is a disagreement as to<br />\nwhether the legal age should be<br />\nraised to 21 or 19. However, the<br />\nHouse Judiciary Committee,<br />\nwhich was assigned to study the<br />\nissue, supports raising the drinking age to 21 unanimously. If<br />\nthe age 21 law is approved, it<br />\nwill go into effect progressively.<br />\nAnyone who is 18 1:14 July 1,<br />\n1982 wil not lose their right to<br />\ndrink. Proponents of raising the<br />\ndrinking age by only (,ne year,<br />\nhowever, are saying that the vote<br />\ncould be closer than expected.<br />\nIn fact, it seems that those<br />\nfavoring the 19 year drinking<br />\nage have a majority.<br />\nIn 1974, the drinking age<br />\nfor wine and beer was lowered<br />\nfrom 21 to 18. Since then, bills<br />\nhave been introduced several<br />\n<br />\ntimes to raise the age, with no<br />\nsuccess. The repeated failure of<br />\nsuch bills was largely due to the<br />\nHouse and Senate's inability to<br />\nagree on the proper age. This<br />\nyear, however, the Senate appears willing to back the House<br />\non whichever bill they choose,<br />\nAn interim committee consisting<br />\nof members of both the House<br />\nand the Senate studied the issue<br />\nduring the past year and favored<br />\nraising the age to 21. Once both<br />\nHouse and Senate approve the<br />\nbill, it will need to be signed by<br />\nthe governor, who is unlikely to<br />\noppose it. The law would then<br />\ngo into effect on July 1.<br />\nA major factor behind the<br />\nbill is the desire to lower drunken driving, and accidents resulting from it, in the state of<br />\nMaryland. People between the<br />\nages of 17 and 20 have a higher<br />\nrate of accidents due to alcohol<br />\nthan any other age group.<br />\nAnother concern is the \"trickledown\" theory.<br />\n18-year-olds<br />\nwho are still in high school buy<br />\nalcohol for their friends. Raising<br />\nthe age would supposedly eliminate such accessibility and thus<br />\n<br />\nRat will continue business as usual if drinking age is raised.<br />\n<br />\nget beer and wine out of the<br />\n<br />\nhigh schools.<br />\nWhile the Judiciary Cornmittee, headed by Joseph E.<br />\nOwens, D-Montgomery, is in<br />\nfavor of raising the age to 21,<br />\nthere are those who oppose it,<br />\nand will vote for raising the age<br />\nto 19. The Prince George's<br />\nCounty delegation and the Republicans are said to be 2-1 in<br />\nfavor of 19, while the city<br />\ndelegation is split.<br />\nSenator J. Joseph Curran,<br />\nJr., D-City, Chairman of the<br />\nJudicial Proceedings Committee<br />\nof the Senate, said that the<br />\nCommittee will post pone further<br />\n<br />\naction on the bills until today,<br />\nby which time the House will<br />\nhave voted.<br />\nAny change in the drinking<br />\nage will have an adverse effect<br />\non bars that cater primarily to a<br />\ncollege crowd.<br />\nThe Rat is<br />\npresently planning to continue<br />\nbusiness as usual should the<br />\ndrinking age go up. They will<br />\ncontinue to serve beer and wine<br />\non Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, and card at the door<br />\nin accordance with the new law.<br />\nThis will continue unless business gets so bad as to necessitate<br />\na change.<br />\n<br />\ncosts to this date.<br />\nStudent Council president<br />\nChuck Peifer expressed uncettainty about tuition figures. He<br />\npointed to the Consumer Price<br />\nIndex which rose approximately<br />\nnine percent last year, and asked<br />\nwhy, given such figures on<br />\ninflation the University thought<br />\nit necessary to increase tuition<br />\nby more than 14 percent. Said<br />\nPeifer, \"We will have to look<br />\ninto the operating expenses of<br />\nthe University\" to see what cost<br />\nincreases warrant such a large<br />\ntuition increase. Dean Hall was<br />\nnot prepared to produce such<br />\nfigures Wednesday, but said after<br />\nhis meeting with the Council<br />\nthat in real terms, tuition costs<br />\nwould be about the same as they<br />\nwere last year.<br />\nSaid Hall: \"Even when you<br />\nhold still, there are automatic<br />\nincreases in costs: fuel, salaries,<br />\npaper, books. The University is<br />\nin the midst of finalizing a<br />\nbudget.<br />\nBudgets have been<br />\nscrutinized in all terms.\"<br />\nDean Hall also affirmed that<br />\nin spite of recent disclosures by<br />\na number of Ivy League schools<br />\nthat ability to pay is a factor in<br />\ndeciding who will or will not be<br />\naccepted for admission, Hopkins<br />\nwill remain blind to ability<br />\nto pay in terms of selecting a<br />\nclass. He says that he does not<br />\nexpect 'changes in tuition or<br />\nfinancial aid to have any affect<br />\non the admissions process.<br />\nHall said that in the coming<br />\nweeks Hopkins will be consulting with other schools in determining how to deal with new<br />\nfinancial problems in need-based<br />\nprograms.<br />\n<br />\nShortage OfBook Spaces Prompts<br />\n<br />\nProposals To Enlarge MSE Library<br />\nBY BRUCE ALPERT<br />\nSusan Martin, the director<br />\nof the Milton S.

Two days later the<br />\nyouth returned to the same<br />\nprofessor and turned himself in.<br />\nCampus police were called in to<br />\nmake the arrest and file the<br />\nwarrant. Because of the seriousness of the crime, the youth was<br />\ncharged and will be tried as an<br />\nadult.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins security<br />\nmade the arrest they immediately turned the matter over to<br />\nBaltimore City police. There has<br />\nbeen no follow-up into the case<br />\nbecause Major Larkin stated that<br />\n\"we do not want to interfere<br />\nwith the city for fear of jeapordizing evidence.\" Hopkins security limits itself to preventive<br />\nand preliminary security measures and has little power to<br />\ncontinue with a case once it has<br />\nbeen handed over to city police.<br />\nConcern over the latest<br />\nincident has raised questions on<br />\nboth security and victim assistance.

The day will be designed<br />\nto educate women on the<br />\nproblems of sexual assault. King<br />\nencouraged all women \"who had<br />\nhad a disturbing sexual experience to call on the counseling<br />\noffice.\"<br />\nThe Office of Counseling<br />\nand Psychiatric Services has<br />\nrecently created a \"sexual assault hotline.\" Victims of sexual<br />\nassault can call the Hopkins<br />\noperator any time during the<br />\nday or night and be connected<br />\nto a staff member who could be<br />\na \"companion\" for the victim,<br />\nand could accompany the victim<br />\nto the hospital and provide<br />\ncounseling.<br />\n<br />\nOffice OffersInformation<br />\nOn StudentScholarships<br />\nBY SHERYL JASSEN<br />\n.As the cost of continuing<br />\neducation increases, many students are turning toward the<br />\ngrants and scholarships available<br />\nto them as an alternative source<br />\nof tuition funding.

For while<br />\nit may be that the cuts have performed<br />\nsome long-overdue trimming of domestic<br />\nspending, things have reached the point<br />\nwhere a basic American ideal\u2014the opportunity for advancement via education\u2014is<br />\nnot merely being threatened but eliminated. It is not simply that the very poor<br />\nare losing their shot at quality higher<br />\neducation, an evil implicit in the cuts from<br />\nthe outset; the category of the victimized<br />\nis growing to include those in higher<br />\neconomic brackets. Hopkins, for example,<br />\nwhile it has pledged itself not to join<br />\nWesleyan in what appears to be a trend, has<br />\nannounced a 14 percent tuition hike for<br />\nnext year. Couple this with the 10 percent<br />\ncut in financial aid instituted by the<br />\nUniversity this year, and you find that the<br />\nstudent in need of aid is facing what<br />\namounts to a 25 percent jump in tuition.<br />\n<br />\nThus, while Hopkins may not deny admission to such a student, it very probably will<br />\nnot be able to extend him the money he<br />\nneeds to come here.<br />\nThe point is that the Reagan cuts<br />\nhave acquired an inexorable media image as<br />\n\"the beginning of a new era,\" the end of<br />\nthe New Deal. While the cuts undeniably<br />\nare the beginning of a necessary era of<br />\nbudget austerity, they must not be allowed<br />\nto roll back some of the basic rights safeguarded by the so-called New Deal era.<br />\nPerhaps the most important of these rights<br />\nis the opportunity for quality higher<br />\neducation, for a democracy is not a democracy without this most basic form of equal<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nWe are just now starting to hear<br />\nabout further cuts being contemplated by<br />\nthe Reagan administration. How much<br />\nfurther can they go before almost no one<br />\ncan afford a higher education? The first<br />\nround of cuts may not have affected many<br />\npeople you or I know here at Hopkins, but<br />\nthe next round most certainly will. It<br />\ncould even be us. And if it's not, we still<br />\ndon't want to be the last generation of<br />\nAmericans who had the luxury of expecting to complete a college education.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nGruntin'Good Fun<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nAh, the joys of the usual<br />\n'rush week debates!' Did it ever<br />\noccur to anyone here that the<br />\nprinciple objects of rush week<br />\n(the freshmen) never seem to<br />\ncomplain about it?

Are they that<br />\nstupid and naive? The only<br />\npeople deserving of contempt<br />\nare those who use the frats in<br />\norder to launch a moral crusade<br />\nagainst the practices which they<br />\nfind personally distasteful (and<br />\nwhich don't concern them at<br />\nall), while at the same time<br />\ncondescendingly flutter their<br />\nhands in anxiety-ridden concern<br />\nfor the poor defenseless freshman. I might point out that, as<br />\nRobin is a junior, as I am, it is<br />\ntechnically illegal for her to<br />\nconsume hard liquor in this<br />\nstate, to say -nothing of the<br />\nfreshmen. (Only people 21,<br />\nusually seniors, and over enjoy<br />\nthat privilege. But the question<br />\nis not one of legality.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCertainly the frats could use<br />\nsome loose monitoring, but the<br />\nfreshmen are not obligated to<br />\nattend such parties. If they<br />\nwant to get sick, it is up to<br />\nthem. College is a time when<br />\nyou must accept responsibility<br />\nfor your actions, and fraternities<br />\nare part of that education<br />\nprocess. It's about time that<br />\nsomeone here tried to look at<br />\neducation (and growing up) as a<br />\nprocess which involves more<br />\nthan the classroom and maybe<br />\nthe SAC. While I am not a<br />\n<br />\nmember of any fraternity (in,<br />\nfact, I believe I was Phi Psi's first<br />\nblackball several years ago), I<br />\ncan see the value of their continued existence as a significant<br />\n,force at Hopkins. The value of<br />\nsuch criticisms as Johnson's, at<br />\nbest, would be to censor the<br />\n:behavior of some basically<br />\n. blameless people\u2014not to mention the fact that the morally<br />\nsmug (who shall remain nameless) would gain the satisfaction<br />\nof \u2022knowing that they have<br />\nstruck another blow at \"licentiousness\" and \"vice.\" On the<br />\nother hand, we run the risk of<br />\ndestroying a potentially significant educational experience for<br />\nHopkins students, dividing the<br />\nHopkins community, and removing one of the few sources of<br />\ngenuine fun and chaos on this<br />\notherwise conservative, stuffy,<br />\nand boring campus.

I thought the<br />\narticle was informative, helpful<br />\nand witty. Only her point which<br />\nsuggested television reruns instead of old movies made me<br />\nquestion her advice.

Even more unfortunately, this classification must be<br />\ndirected at members of the<br />\nNews-Letter editorial board so<br />\nthat further misinformation will<br />\nnot be espoused by the EditorIn-Chief and Arts Editor and so<br />\nthat campus groups and outside<br />\norganizations will not be confused. I refer to last week's<br />\nentirely justified letter by Sports<br />\nEditor Steve Eisenberg and Joe<br />\nLevine's reply.<br />\nThe advertising deadline has<br />\nalways been and will remain<br />\n5:00 Wednesday afternoons.<br />\nThe B/ossius ads were inserted<br />\nafter the deadline, without the<br />\nknowledge of the Business Managers, an occurrence that simply<br />\nshouldn't have taken place. The<br />\nfact that these ads were inserted,<br />\nat all, infuriates me for several<br />\nreasons:<br />\n1) I had been trying to find<br />\nsome space for a FILM SERIES<br />\nad that was submitted late and<br />\nwould, thus, have been subject<br />\nto additional charges\u2014more<br />\nmoney for the financially<br />\nstrapped News-Letter. The ad<br />\nspace given to Blossius could<br />\npossibly have been consolidated<br />\ninto a smaller ad for the movie.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\f\"<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LITTER/ PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nN-L Washes Its Dirty Laundry In Public Sink<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\n2) Campus Notes were<br />\nREMOVED in order that one of<br />\nthe Blossius ads could be inserted. Since I had guaranteed<br />\nthat one of the \"bumped\" notes<br />\nwould run, I felt responsible. It<br />\nalso makes for bad business<br />\npolicy. Campus groups can be<br />\nassured that if their notes are<br />\nreceived on time, in the proper<br />\nform, they will be run.<br />\n3) Mr. Levine's \"forgiveable<br />\ndonation\" is UNFORGIVEABLE. The News-Letter, as Joe<br />\nknows, is in no position to be<br />\ndonating things to its own<br />\nmembers or anyone else for that<br />\nmatter.<br />\n4) \"It is not unreasonable<br />\nfor the News-Letter, at its<br />\ndiscretion, to extend a certain<br />\namount of charity to a school<br />\nevent.\" I ask Mr. Levine to<br />\ndefine the News-Letter. Is it<br />\nhim? Is it me? Is it an Ed.<br />\nBoard? Or is it a combination<br />\n<br />\nthereof? I, as Business Manager,<br />\nfind it highly unreasonable for<br />\nany ads to be given away.<br />\nRegarding charity, the only<br />\ncharity that the News-Letter<br />\nactually ever gives to, as Eisenberg asserts, is \"a select group<br />\nof people.\" Unfortunately, free<br />\nspace has also been given to<br />\nother campus groups by the<br />\nBusiness Managers themselves.<br />\n(the California Suite ad of last<br />\nweek). I, personally, object to<br />\ngiving away free ad space for ads<br />\nother than personal messages. In<br />\nother words, I object to the<br />\nCalifornia Suite ad. A decision<br />\nclarifying this policy should be<br />\nmade by the Editorial Board. I,<br />\nas Business Manager, try to<br />\nfollow a policy of trying to be<br />\nobjective and fair. I would hope<br />\nthat the News-Letter will adopt<br />\nthis policy and/or clarify it.<br />\nAs further clarification,<br />\nBlossius would not have been<br />\nthe recipient of any free ads<br />\n<br />\nunless the Business Managers<br />\nwere informed and arrangements<br />\nfor payment of the publicity<br />\nposters had been made (they<br />\nwere done at the Gatehouse.).<br />\nIn general, free ad space will not<br />\nbe given to any group, ever,<br />\nwithout the approval of both the<br />\nBusiness Managers and the<br />\nEditor-in-Chief and the demonstration of real need. If any<br />\nfurther violations of the \"no<br />\ncharity\" policy occur, the NewsLetter obviously has no need for<br />\na Business Manager.

She was moved to<br />\nwrite this after learning of a<br />\nrecent rape here on campus. For<br />\nobvious reasons, she has chosen<br />\nto withhold her name.<br />\nI will tell you what it is like<br />\nto be raped. Strange to say, the<br />\nsexual assault itself was the least<br />\nfrightening part. During that<br />\ntime I could still pray and hope<br />\nthat after it was over he would<br />\ndecide not to kill me. And in<br />\nmy case, something in my loud<br />\nand fervent prayer did frustrate<br />\nhim. Because of this, I was<br />\nnot actually \"raped\" in the legal<br />\nsense which requires actual intercourse. Legalities, however, did<br />\nnot enter into my thoughts<br />\nduring those 20 minutes on a<br />\nrainy Sunday afternoon. The<br />\nknife, the fear, and the innocence were enough to change,<br />\npermanently, a 16 year old's<br />\nperception of life, love, and<br />\nmen.<br />\nI grew up that day. The<br />\nexperience has become incorporated into my every action. I<br />\nlearned of man's inhumanity to<br />\nman abruptly, rather than in the<br />\nevolutionary pattern of maturation. Instead, this lesson of<br />\nlife Was forced upon me at 16. I<br />\nwas an innocent with a view of<br />\n<br />\nlife directly descended from<br />\nRousseau. No longer.<br />\nDealing with family and<br />\nfriends was more difficult than<br />\ndealing with the police, who<br />\nalthough they tried to be sympathetic, succeeded only in being<br />\nsterile, coldly probing, making<br />\nme recall every last detail of an<br />\nevent I wanted desperately to<br />\nforget.

I was not<br />\nallowed to bathe first\u2014I might<br />\nhave washed off evidence, a<br />\npiece of cloth, hair, or nails<br />\nbelonging to him. Although I<br />\nwas covered with mud and<br />\nleaves, my desire to wash<br />\nstemmed more from my compulsion to wash every trace of him<br />\nfrom me\u2014to try to purify myself<br />\nonce more. My mother understood this, while my father was<br />\ntoo angry at him to be compassionate. Aside from this, their<br />\nfeelings and actions were mixtures of possessiveness (protectiveness) and being distant, trying to allow me to work things<br />\nout for myself.

In an<br />\nattempt to find out how the<br />\nsystem can be reorganized in<br />\norder to better serve the student<br />\nbody, the Student Council Education Committe has been collecting information about advising at various other universities.<br />\nAt Dartmouth College, for<br />\ninstance, each freshman has a<br />\nfaculty advisor who remains<br />\nwith them for three terms.<br />\nLater, as students decide on<br />\ntheir area of academic interest,<br />\ndepartmental advisors assume<br />\nThey<br />\ngreater responsibility.<br />\nprovide information and help in<br />\nthe selection of a major field of<br />\nstudy. In addition to faculty<br />\nand departmental advisors, there<br />\nare undergraduate advisors within each dormitory. Their job is<br />\nto orient new students and<br />\nprovide informal but practical<br />\nadvise to freshmen.<br />\nThe system at Stanford<br />\nUniversity is very different from<br />\nthat which is in use at Hopkins.<br />\nTheir Academic Information<br />\nCenter, which is largely con-<br />\n<br />\ncerned with the advising of<br />\nundergraduates with undeclared<br />\nthe<br />\nadministrates<br />\nmajors,<br />\nGeneral Academic advising program.

Also,<br />\neach freshman residence is<br />\nserved by an advising team<br />\ncomposed of 5 to 25 faculty and<br />\nstaff members.<br />\nEach team<br />\nincludes at least one representative of each academic area.<br />\nWhen a student declares a major,<br />\nhe or she changes to an advisor<br />\nwithin the major department.<br />\nStanford also has an Advising Associate Program, which<br />\nis very similar to the Student<br />\nAdvising Program at Hopkins.<br />\nFinally, they have two<br />\nsupplementary programs, the<br />\npre-professional advising program and the \"on-call\" general<br />\nadvising program. The \"on-call\"<br />\nadvisors, based in the Academic<br />\nInformation Center, are available<br />\nto all undergraduates on a<br />\nwalk-in or appointment basis.<br />\nAt least in the freshman<br />\nyear, the system at Yale University is similar to Hopkins'.<br />\nEach student has a Freshman<br />\n<br />\nLibrary Receives Grant<br />\nForInformation Systems<br />\nThe Milton S.

A Committee vote<br />\nrecommending that the Council<br />\ncontinue to express its objection<br />\nto plus/minus grading resulted in<br />\na tie. It was finally decided by<br />\nthat Committee that it should<br />\n<br />\nrescind its earlier vote not to<br />\nsend the letter to Dean Owen to<br />\nthe Council, and that it should<br />\nleave other action to the discretion of Council.<br />\nIn addition to the letter,<br />\nCouncil is currently considering<br />\na motion that would express its<br />\ncontinued<br />\ndisapproval<br />\nof<br />\nplus/minus grading.

There is not one<br />\nsources of funds include alumni nation in the world\u2014not one<br />\n<br />\n\u2014that is truly communist, in the<br />\nsense that Karl Marx meant it: a<br />\nclassless society, the means of<br />\nproduction being owned by the<br />\nworkers and all decisions made<br />\nby them on a completely democratic basis. Those totalitarian<br />\nstates that call themselves Communist (the most prominent<br />\nbeing the Soviet Union) merely<br />\nmake communism look bad.<br />\nThe reason why proletarian<br />\nrevolution so often goes awry is<br />\nthat no genuinely communist<br />\ncountry can survive in a world<br />\ncontrolled by capitalists. Capitalism is based on production<br />\nand exchange of commodities,<br />\nand it requires growth; its<br />\ngrowth is derived from the<br />\nuncompsensated surplus labor of<br />\nthe workers. Communism, on<br />\nthe other hand, involves production of things that people need,<br />\nby and for the people, rather<br />\nthan by wage-labor for the profit<br />\nof the capitalist. There is no<br />\nneed for exploitation of workers. The two economic systems<br />\ncannot coexist. Until the capitalist system is completely overthrown, communism will never<br />\nsucceed.<br />\nThe hypocrisy of upholding<br />\n\"democracy\" by trying to wipe<br />\nout \"communism\" is all too<br />\nglaring these days. Scott Shires,<br />\nin his article on El Salvador<br />\n(2/5/82), claims that \"The junta<br />\nholds the only promise, at<br />\npresent, of getting on the road<br />\nto democracy.\" This is like<br />\nsaying that the key to racial<br />\nequality is segregated schooling.<br />\n\"Authoritarian\" (fascist) government, today eagerly backed by<br />\nU.S. capitalists, is the antithesis<br />\nof democracy. Of course, it<br />\nmight serve to usher in democracy insofar as it could incite a<br />\nworkers' revolution. Unfortunately, that is probably not what<br />\nMr. Shires meant.<br />\n<br />\nhave decided that going to trial<br />\nwould have been a trauma for<br />\nThe whole dirty thing<br />\nme.<br />\nwould have to be told and retold<br />\nin front of strangers. And I<br />\nwould have to see him again, and<br />\nremember; in a way, the words<br />\nof the story could never evoke<br />\nhow I_ felt that day. I am<br />\nfortunate that that never occurred, but it is true that no<br />\nmatter how far one runs one<br />\ncannot escape the past, and I am<br />\n, no exception. Certain thoughts,<br />\npeople, places or events can still<br />\ncause that particular mix of fear,<br />\nhatred, and confusion to well up<br />\nonce more inside me. The<br />\n<br />\nHe then warns us: \"As an<br />\nexample of what happens when<br />\nguerillas triumph, the jails of<br />\nNicaragua are so full that warehouses have been converted into<br />\njails.\" I offer another example<br />\nof what happens when guerillas<br />\ntriumph:<br />\nover two hundred<br />\nyears ago, guerillas fought it out<br />\nwith the foreign government<br />\nthat was tyrannically running<br />\ntheir small country from overseas, and won\u2014the result was the<br />\nUnited States of America. (Oh,<br />\ndon't get me wrong: I am no<br />\nsupporter of the U.S. government. Although my human<br />\nrights are respected here probably more than they would be<br />\nanywhere else, the. U.S. has<br />\ndropped more bombs, killed<br />\nmore people and committed<br />\nmore blatantly hypocritical acts<br />\nof internal and external terrorism than any other government.)<br />\n<br />\nrecent rape in Dunning Hall is<br />\namong those events. I, too,<br />\nhave been a witness to situations involving trespassers on<br />\nthis campus. Then I think back<br />\nto that time only two and a half<br />\nyears ago, and decide (in all<br />\nsanity) that if it every happened<br />\nagain, I would hope that the<br />\nrapist would kill me when it was<br />\nover. Or maybe before.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Shires' last paragraph is<br />\nan exquisite display of imperialist-capitalist rhetoric. He says,<br />\nin a nutshell, that what El<br />\nSalvador needs is \"economic<br />\ndevelopment\" (read: \"exploitation\") by the U.S., and that<br />\n\"leftist victory\" is a nice idea<br />\nbut won't work.

I appeal<br />\nto you\u2014in the interest of all I<br />\nhave been through\u2014to please<br />\nhelp me preserve my anonymity.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Shires is absolutely right<br />\nabout one thing: \"leftist victory\" is not what El Salvador<br />\nneeds, or what any nation needs<br />\nfor that matter.

But true communism does not involve barging into<br />\nother countries and forcefully<br />\ntaking over, the Soviet Union<br />\nnotwithstanding (the USSR<br />\n<br />\nOn Rape And Survival<br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\nVery few people know of<br />\nthis incident.

Robin, I<br />\nagree with what you said, a small<br />\npart of it anyway. However, I<br />\ndo not feel you are entirely<br />\ncognizant of the reality of the<br />\nsituation. Fraternities are more<br />\nthan just sex, drugs, and rock<br />\nand roll. You said \"Fraternities<br />\nare supposed to be organizations<br />\ndedicated to brotherhood.\" I<br />\nsay they are. Having been an<br />\nofficer in one of the largest<br />\nfraternities, TEP, for the past 2<br />\nyears, I feel that I am much<br />\nmore qualified to make a judgment about the existence of<br />\nbrotherhood in our Greek system. Robin, fraternities are<br />\nbased on brotherhood. You, as<br />\nan outsider, can not know what<br />\nit means to experience fraternal<br />\nbrotherhood, simply because it<br />\nis an intangible.<br />\nThis is part of the reason<br />\nwhy I am responding to your<br />\nletter. Much of what you said is<br />\nseriously misleading and contemptable. Robin, it was not<br />\nfair of you to accuse us of<br />\nmisogyny (yes, I looked it up;it<br />\nmeans hatred of women). I<br />\nwent to a stripper night as a<br />\nfreshman, mostly out of curiosity, but do you really think I<br />\nhate you? Personally, I do not<br />\ncondone the raffling off of a<br />\nwoman for any reason. I would<br />\nalso like to state that we of<br />\nthe Tau Epsilon Phi Fraternity<br />\nhave never had a stripper night<br />\nand never will. We believe there<br />\nis more to life than just getting<br />\nlaid (and as soon as we figure<br />\nout what it is, we'll let you<br />\nknow.). Even though there are<br />\nsome peculiar practices during<br />\nRush, I think there is still room<br />\nfor respect for the entire fraternity system.<br />\nThere is only one more<br />\ncomment that I would like to<br />\nmake on your column. When<br />\nyou said the reason why we need<br />\nnew members is only to receive<br />\nmoney from them, my heart<br />\nnearly broke\u2014from anger.

Nevertheless, the attempted<br />\ncoup d'etat that startled Madrid last February 23 presented a surprise I was not prepared to deal with.<br />\n<br />\nby Martin Carlson<br />\nAt five o'ciocic in the afternoon on that day, the<br />\nPrado Museum closed its doors, and my art history class<br />\nin the El Graco rooms ended. Since the weather was<br />\nalready fairly warm and the Castilian sky was as blue as<br />\never, a friend and I opted to take the your walk back to<br />\nour respective dormitories instead of suffocating in the<br />\nMetro. We headed uphill past the Cortes (the Spanis<br />\nParliament), down the Gran Via (the Main Drag), then<br />\nover to the Ciudad Universitaria (the University of<br />\nMadrid's campus). Before separating, we stood on the<br />\ncorner in front of the Minesterio del Aire (Air Force<br />\nHeadquarters) to talk for about fifteen minutes.<br />\nIt was about seven when I finally arrived home to<br />\nmy dormitory room and buried my nose in a fat Spanish<br />\nnovel about a provocative adulteress. I figured that I<br />\ncould finish the description of the Don Juan type who<br />\nseduced her before I ate dinner at nine thirty.<br />\nI had just become settled on my bed when in<br />\nbarged my friend Pablo, who instantly destroyed my<br />\nJabbering in almost incomprehensible<br />\ntranquility.<br />\nSpanish, he reported that a right-wing Guardia Civil<br />\n(Spanish paramilitary) group led by Lieutenant Colonel<br />\nAntonio Tejero had burst into the Cortes chamber of<br />\nrepresentatives while the elected officials were voting on<br />\nthe nomination of Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo for president.<br />\nThe Guardia's intention: to overthrow the Spanish<br />\ngovernment. I believed not a word Pablo said, since my<br />\nSpanish buddies were forever trying to pull my leg; yet<br />\nhe convinced me to listen to the radio broadcasts so that<br />\nI could verify the report myself.<br />\nHearing was believing, but all of us that had<br />\ngathered around the tiny radio remained extremely<br />\nconfused. Many students expected all forms of communication to be cut off, yet even in the Cortes itself<br />\nboth a television camera and a microphone remained to<br />\nrecord the events for the Spanish people.<br />\nReacting like the typically naive Yankee, I<br />\nimmediately proposed running down to the Cortes to<br />\ninvestigate the situation; but the Spaniards rejected such<br />\nrash stupidity. In fact, it was as if they had sixth sense<br />\nof what to do in a state of siege. Most of the guys in my<br />\ndormitory attempted to telephone their homes in the<br />\nprovinces to discover if the Guardia Civil had seized<br />\ncontrol outside the capital. Those fortunate enough to<br />\nown cars filled them with gas and packed suitcases so<br />\nthey would be able to escape the city if violence were to<br />\nerupt. Not a soul dared step outside the confines of the<br />\ndormitory.<br />\nBy eight thirty the busy intersection in front of<br />\nthe dormitory was deserted, save occasional police<br />\nmotorcycles that flashed through the night. The students already had begun to imagine the consequences of<br />\na successful coup d'etat. I might have been deported<br />\nfrom the country, but worse yet, classes at the University of Madrid might have been cancelled in an attempt<br />\nto keep the \"radical\" students from protesting a rightwing takeover. There might have been some sort of<br />\npurge of the Communist Party, of which some of my<br />\nfriends were members. Newspaper editors, writers,<br />\npoets, educators, and labor leaders might have been<br />\nseverely punished. But few dared mention the worst<br />\npossible consequence: another Spanish civil war with<br />\nthe world having to choose sides between a Soviet Left<br />\nand a fascist Right.<br />\nIn response to Tejero's takeover, General Jaime<br />\nMilans del Bosch in Valencia placed his southeastern<br />\nSpanish province in a state of siege. He suspended all<br />\npolitical and public liberties and prohibited gatherings of<br />\nmore than four people. Tejero and his Guardia Civil<br />\ncronies in Madrid awaited even more military commanders in the provinces to back their operation.<br />\n<br />\nYet later that night King Juan Carlos I dealt a<br />\nblow to the usurpers when he appeared on Spanish<br />\ntelevision. Outfitted in his complete military garb to<br />\nemphasize his role as chief of the armed forces, he<br />\nrefused to succumb to the ultraderechistas, the extreme<br />\nRight. \"The Crown,\" he announced,\"will never tolerate<br />\nthe forced interruption of the democratic process<br />\ndecided upon by the Spanish people.\"<br />\nAt that I went to bed, totally exhausted after a<br />\nday of such tension. The following morning, the dormitory continued to buzz as the students remained glued<br />\nto their radios, slurping their cafe and gobbling their<br />\npan. No other province had fallen, and the immediate<br />\nthreat of danger had passed. By the end of the day,<br />\nTejero was under control, and the government had<br />\nrestored constitutional order.<br />\nThe attempted coup even affected the often<br />\nout-of-tune americanos. The day following the event,<br />\nexcitement filled the Instituto Internacional as students<br />\nall compared notes and asked each other, \"Where were<br />\nyou when the coup broke out?\" Most of us were<br />\nconcerned about our adopted country and did not want<br />\nto see it collapse under the pressure of revolutionary<br />\nforces. On the other hand, we recognized our impotence<br />\nwhen we realized that we would be leaving Spain in a<br />\nfew months. Had the coup been successful, the native<br />\nSpaniards\u2014not the visiting American students\u2014would<br />\nhave had to suffer the consequences of a repressive<br />\nregime.<br />\nThe ordeal was more than perplexing, especially<br />\nconsidering it all happened in Spanish. Comments and<br />\nevaluations bombarded me from all sides, but two<br />\nquestions seemed to recur: One: Colonel Tejera had<br />\npreviously been involved in an attempted coup in 1978.<br />\nHe concocted the Galaxy conspiracy in a Madrid cafe in<br />\nmy neighborhood and called for the seizure and murder<br />\nof the first post-Franco president, Adolfo Suarez. The<br />\nplans fell through and Tejero escaped with only a mild<br />\nslap on the wrist. How could the government allow such<br />\na crackpot to return to active duty in an important<br />\nleadership role following such a fiasco? Two: Could a<br />\nsudden overthrow of the government occur in the<br />\nUnited States? The Spanish university students were<br />\nforever pressing me with this question. My answer was<br />\ngenerally,\"No, not like the one Tejero tried to pull off.\"<br />\nI listed several reasons, including the federalist system,<br />\nthe weakness of the extremist parties, and a long tradition of government stability in the USA.<br />\nThe attempted coup caught me by surprise, but<br />\ncontemporary Spanish politics should have led me to<br />\nexpect drastic measures. Follwoing the 1939 victory of<br />\nthe Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, General<br />\nFrancisco Franco established his fascist reign in Spain.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nmembers of the neo-fascist political party Fuerza Nueva<br />\nparaded past my dormitory on their way to pay homage<br />\nto Franco's grave on the anniversary of his death.<br />\nIn spite of the chaos plaguing Madrid during the<br />\ncoup attempt, the Cortes somehow gathered together<br />\nand voted for Calvo Sotelo as president only a few days<br />\nafter the tragedy. To celebrate a triumph of the democracy, center and leftists parties organized a rally, which I<br />\natttended with my friends Ronco and Pablo. On a dark<br />\nFriday afternoon, one of the rare days when drizzle fell<br />\non the semi-desert Castilian region, we caught the bus<br />\ndowntown. There we encountered more people than I<br />\nhad ever seen before: Spaniards packing the streets,<br />\noverflowing on the wrought-iron balconies, and pressing<br />\nagainst the numerous fountains.<br />\nAfter hopping off the bus, I soon noticed that<br />\nthe hundreds of thousands of Spaniards present made<br />\nrelatively little noise. I later discovered that the leaders<br />\nhad organized the rally around the theme of the silent<br />\nmajority's support for the existing democracy. Hence,<br />\nthe participants carried no banners that espoused grandiose proclamations and\u2014at least in the beginning \u2014<br />\nchanted no slogans.<br />\nWhereas Ronco and Pablo soon became bored<br />\nand returned to the dormitory, I remained enthralled. I<br />\nhurried past the Prado, up to where the culmination of<br />\nactivities would be, directly in front of the Cortes. I<br />\nstationed myself in the small plaza in front of the<br />\nspeakers' podium, slightly uphill from the area a line of<br />\nmarchers would be coming from. Standing on my<br />\ntiptoes and being a head taller than the average Spaniard<br />\nhelped me catch a glimpse of the action down below.<br />\nAfter a few minutes, the vociferous Mediterraneans refused to remain a silent majority, and the<br />\ncheering began:<br />\n\"Viva el rey!\" shouted one man.<br />\n\"Viva!\" responded the crowd. Their echoes<br />\nreverberated off the elegant facades of the tall buildings.<br />\n\"Viva la democracia! Viva la lihertad! Viva el<br />\nrey!\"<br />\n\"Que vivan!\"<br />\nWhen the drizzle turned to rain, I left the rally<br />\nconvinced that the Spanish people would at least give<br />\ntheir form of government a chance to institute valuable<br />\nsocial reforms. Yet my faith began to diminish soon<br />\nafter the rally, when I learned that large cities such as<br />\nMadrid and Barcelona supported the democracy more<br />\nthan the provinces, that the massive rally in the streets<br />\nof Madrid was not necessarily a true indication of the<br />\nsentiments of the entire Spanish population. Also, a<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nEA<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThough not a Hitler, Franco was not exactly a pioneer in<br />\nsocial reform during his 36 years in power. Upon his<br />\ndeath in 1975, the country returned to the long lost<br />\nmonarchy, but this time qualified it with a constitution.<br />\nNonetheless, the Spanish Right continues to<br />\nbelieve that Franco was a benevolent and just ruler who<br />\nbrought the country stability and prosperity while<br />\nkeeping the Marxists away from disruptive actions.<br />\nThis great myth is supported by the country's current<br />\n_problems\u2014inflation, unemployment, rising crime rate,<br />\nunrest in the Basque region\u2014and the democracy's<br />\nweakness in dealing with them. I heard many American<br />\nstudents joke about the widows they boarded with who<br />\noften reminisced about the \"good old days:\" \"When<br />\nFranco was alive, we could walk alone on the streets at<br />\nnight. . .When Franco was alive, the prices were much<br />\nlower.. .\"<br />\nIn addition to these average citizens, fascist<br />\nyouth movements and scores of military officials constitute Spain's answer to the Moral Majority and are out to<br />\nprevent the people from acquiring such legal rights as<br />\ndivorce and abortion. The pressure from these groups<br />\nwas evident well before the attempted coup, as when<br />\n<br />\ncrisis developed over the contamination of the olive oil<br />\nsupplies so important to the Spanish diet. Hundreds of<br />\npeople died and the victims' families have since turned<br />\nto the government for help. The government feels a<br />\ngreat obligation and realizes that it must prove to the<br />\npeople that it can effectively handle such crises.<br />\nMost of all, the Basque terrorists(ETA)continue<br />\nto slaughter people in the name of their homeland<br />\nEuskadi, while members of the military continue to<br />\nretaliate by torturing ETA prisoners and reinforcing<br />\ntheir stronghold on Euslcadi. Jorge Semprun wrote in<br />\nL'Express of March 7, 1981, that the two extremes \"are<br />\nbound by the same blood pact. They both need the<br />\nresurgence of Francoism to help them legitimize their<br />\naction.\"<br />\n<br />\nTo win the faith of the Spanish people., the<br />\ndemocracy must wedge itself between the two extremes<br />\nand destroy the blood pact created out of the violence<br />\nof the country's past. It will be a difficult task, and time<br />\nis crucial: any mistake guarantees immediate reactions<br />\nfrom the extremist opposition.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16/ FEBRUARY ;12, 1982<br />\n<br />\nLou Reed's Blue Mask<br />\nBY GEORGE YATCHISIN<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Mask ends as it begins: with<br />\nhope. The first cut, \"My House,\" borIt is essential when one is review- rows the guitar attitudes of Street Hassle<br />\ning a rock album to remember one is but is nonetheless a quiet affair, with<br />\ndealing with just that: an album. Lou Doane Perry's drumwork not keeping<br />\nReed's latest release, The Blue Mask, time but rather creating melody. \"My<br />\nproves this statement; it's one unity that House\" is a eulogy for poet and critic<br />\nwinds back on itself musically and Delmore Schwartz, who as Reed's friend<br />\nlyrically so it manages to say something becomes Reed's muse (see the Velvet's<br />\nin the end. Reed has been around for \"European Son\").<br />\nReed sings (yes,<br />\nover fifteen years now, and next to David he actually sings through most of the<br />\nBowie, has probably gone through more album, habit-breaking as it might seem),<br />\nchanges than any rock figure. But no \"I've really got a lucky life/My writing,<br />\nmatter how the music has changed my motorcycle, my wife.\" His pleasures<br />\nthrough the years, at least since 1976's seem to be simple things, and the most<br />\nConey Island Baby he's been pushing one simple of these is love. The album may<br />\nmessage: love. The Blue Mask is no open with a eulogy, but ends with a love<br />\nsong.<br />\nexception.<br />\nThe love song is actually the third<br />\nThe title track expresses Reed's<br />\nworldview most succinctly. Musically it's of a trilogy of love. The first tune of the<br />\na Velvet Underground throwback circa group, \"Women,\" is lyrically as playful as<br />\nWhite Light, White Heat, complete with any Reed (i.e., Growing Up In Public),<br />\n\"messy\" production (not quite a sloppy but instead of trying to lay every female,<br />\nPhil Spector), guitar feedback and distor- he glorifies them. Women become the<br />\ntion, crashing drums and cymbals, and answer to all the maladies of the world as<br />\nabove all Reed's voice which shouts more laid down in \"Blue Mask.\" In \"Women\"<br />\nthan sings. But it's not punk values he's he sings of love, backed by guitar work<br />\nextolling, it is the confusion of today's that is almost harplike.<br />\nAlways an<br />\nugliness, violence, sin, pain, accomplished rhythm guitarist, here Reed<br />\nworld:<br />\npunks' gore, masks, punishment, apathy, makes chords rain; there are no sharp<br />\nhate, even Oedipal conflicts. What he is edges, only soothing sounds. This is true<br />\nsaying is you can't hide; all these things for much of the album, for things are so<br />\nare out there and are gonna getcha. He comforting that the listener can be lulled<br />\nends with the lines, \"Don't take death to numbness. The problem is that this<br />\naway/Cut the finger at the joint/Cut the album is tough, living up perfectly to the<br />\nstallion at his mount/And stuff it in his notion of getting better with repeated<br />\nlistenings.<br />\nmouth.\"<br />\nThe second of the trilogy, \"The<br />\nSo it's not a pleasant world. Yet<br />\nHeroine,\" is too much of a pun on the<br />\nVelvet's \"Heroin\" to miss. But the point<br />\nis clear: women now are the answer, the<br />\nonly saving grace, while drugs don't make<br />\nit (not that he said they did in 1967).<br />\nits best; these are also the scenes in which Even the sound of \"The Heroine\" is akin<br />\nArthur develops a reasonable semblance to a<br />\nVelvet Underground recording,<br />\nof maturity as he nurses the dying making it clear his search is over.<br />\nThe love song itself, \"Heavenly<br />\nHobson.

Arthur, an unpretentious excursion into the sort of loopy<br />\nhumor that the British, notably P.G.<br />\nWodehouse, specialize in, has all the<br />\ningredients for a classic movie comedy:<br />\nsuperb comic timing, character actors<br />\nwho vigorously chew the scenery,. and a<br />\nplot as soppy and convoluted as its hero is<br />\nsimply sodden. Poor little rich boy<br />\nArthur (Dudley Moore) can have everything his ill-gotten loot can buy\u2014and<br />\nwhat he primarily aims to be is the<br />\nworld's most alcoholic playboy. But<br />\nresponsibility lurks behind his wine cellar,<br />\nand by the movie's end, Arthur is prodded down the road to adulthood, learning<br />\nabout love, caring, and values\u2014but not<br />\nwithout first getting into reels of pratfalls<br />\nand problems.<br />\nPredicament number one: the<br />\nfamilial powers that be have decreed<br />\nArthur's imminent betrothal to the<br />\ninsipid but loaded Susan, who comes<br />\ncomplete with fortune, a mansion with<br />\nstuffed jungle animals, and a belligerent<br />\nfather who informs Arthur that he must<br />\nand will give up alcohol, much to his<br />\ndrunken chagrin.<br />\nPredicament number two: while<br />\nArthur is purchasing three dozen sweaters<br />\nat Bergdorf Goodman's to rebel against<br />\nthis match, he meets a would-be actress<br />\nfrom Queens (Liza Minnelli) who supports herself by shoplifting. Needless to<br />\nsay, he is entranced by this creature from<br />\nthe huddled masses and falls in love with<br />\nher, leading to:<br />\nPredicament number three: disinheritance looks Arthur right in his<br />\nbloodshot eyes if he fails to marry Susan.<br />\nProperly primed, he sloshes his way over<br />\nand dutifully proposes, with all the<br />\nenthusiasm of a three-day-old meatloaf.<br />\nInto all this chaos steps the<br />\ninvincible<br />\nand<br />\nincorrigible<br />\nSir<br />\nJohn Gielgud , the Jeeves of Arthur. As<br />\n<br />\nHobson, Arthur's butler, valet and<br />\nnursemaid, it is he that engineers the<br />\nshenanigans leading to Arthur's once<br />\nagain chasing his dotty Queen of Queens,<br />\nand to the showdown at his wedding. It<br />\nis in the scenes between Arthur and<br />\nHobson that comic repartee operates at<br />\n<br />\nBarthelme To Read At Arts Festival<br />\nBY SUZANNE CONKLIN<br />\n<br />\nsions, rather than merely those of the<br />\naward winners.

In formulating the<br />\nincrease, Dean Hall said that<br />\nconsideration was given not only<br />\nto the needs of those students<br />\nalready enrolled at Johns Hopkins, but also to those of the<br />\nprospective freshman class.<br />\nThis coming year's increase<br />\nrepresents a smaller percentage<br />\nincrease than last year's, which<br /><br />\nwas in excess of 15 percent.<br />\nHall also stated that Johns<br />\nHopkins' proposed tuition hike<br />\nis \"in the ballpark\" with many<br />\nother schools of its type, which<br />\nhe said are planning tuition<br />\nincreases of 10 to 15 percent in<br />\nthe coming year.<br />\nHall also said that the<br />\nUniversity dollar content of<br />\nmany existing financial aid<br />\npackages would also rise, but he<br />\nwas unsure what the net effect<br />\nof such increases would be. In<br />\nterms of outside aid, Hall said,<br />\n\"We won't know how much<br />\nmoney we will be getting from<br />\nthe Federal Government until<br />\nthe mid-summer.\"<br />\nThe proposed tuition increase will go to the University<br />\ntrustees for approval on Feb. 22.<br />\nlie said that questions about the<br />\n*Reagan budget for the 1983<br />\nfiscal year caused a delay in<br />\nannouncing next year's tuition<br /><br />\nAssembly Plans To Raise Drinking Age<br />\nBY DIANA NEWMAN<br />\nThe legal drinking age in<br />\nMaryland for wine and beer will<br />\nmost likely change before the<br />\nstate legislature finishes its present term in late February.<br />\nThe House of D 'gates is<br />\nscheduled to vote on the issue<br />\nsometime in the near future.<br />\nThere is a disagreement as to<br />\nwhether the legal age should be<br />\nraised to 21 or 19. However, the<br />\nHouse Judiciary Committee,<br />\nwhich was assigned to study the<br />\nissue, supports raising the drinking age to 21 unanimously. If<br />\nthe age 21 law is approved, it<br />\nwill go into effect progressively.<br />\nAnyone who is 18 1:14 July 1,<br />\n1982 wil not lose their right to<br />\ndrink. Proponents of raising the<br />\ndrinking age by only (,ne year,<br />\nhowever, are saying that the vote<br />\ncould be closer than expected.<br />\nIn fact, it seems that those<br />\nfavoring the 19 year drinking<br />\nage have a majority.<br />\nIn 1974, the drinking age<br />\nfor wine and beer was lowered<br />\nfrom 21 to 18. Since then, bills<br />\nhave been introduced several<br /><br />\ntimes to raise the age, with no<br />\nsuccess. The repeated failure of<br />\nsuch bills was largely due to the<br />\nHouse and Senate's inability to<br />\nagree on the proper age. This<br />\nyear, however, the Senate appears willing to back the House<br />\non whichever bill they choose,<br />\nAn interim committee consisting<br />\nof members of both the House<br />\nand the Senate studied the issue<br />\nduring the past year and favored<br />\nraising the age to 21. Once both<br />\nHouse and Senate approve the<br />\nbill, it will need to be signed by<br />\nthe governor, who is unlikely to<br />\noppose it. The law would then<br />\ngo into effect on July 1.<br />\nA major factor behind the<br />\nbill is the desire to lower drunken driving, and accidents resulting from it, in the state of<br />\nMaryland. People between the<br />\nages of 17 and 20 have a higher<br />\nrate of accidents due to alcohol<br />\nthan any other age group.<br />\nAnother concern is the \"trickledown\" theory.<br />\n18-year-olds<br />\nwho are still in high school buy<br />\nalcohol for their friends. Raising<br />\nthe age would supposedly eliminate such accessibility and thus<br /><br />\nRat will continue business as usual if drinking age is raised.<br /><br />\nget beer and wine out of the<br /><br />\nhigh schools.<br />\nWhile the Judiciary Cornmittee, headed by Joseph E.<br />\nOwens, D-Montgomery, is in<br />\nfavor of raising the age to 21,<br />\nthere are those who oppose it,<br />\nand will vote for raising the age<br />\nto 19. The Prince George's<br />\nCounty delegation and the Republicans are said to be 2-1 in<br />\nfavor of 19, while the city<br />\ndelegation is split.<br />\nSenator J. Joseph Curran,<br />\nJr., D-City, Chairman of the<br />\nJudicial Proceedings Committee<br />\nof the Senate, said that the<br />\nCommittee will post pone further<br /><br />\naction on the bills until today,<br />\nby which time the House will<br />\nhave voted.<br />\nAny change in the drinking<br />\nage will have an adverse effect<br />\non bars that cater primarily to a<br />\ncollege crowd.<br />\nThe Rat is<br />\npresently planning to continue<br />\nbusiness as usual should the<br />\ndrinking age go up. They will<br />\ncontinue to serve beer and wine<br />\non Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, and card at the door<br />\nin accordance with the new law.<br />\nThis will continue unless business gets so bad as to necessitate<br />\na change.<br /><br />\ncosts to this date.<br />\nStudent Council president<br />\nChuck Peifer expressed uncettainty about tuition figures. He<br />\npointed to the Consumer Price<br />\nIndex which rose approximately<br />\nnine percent last year, and asked<br />\nwhy, given such figures on<br />\ninflation the University thought<br />\nit necessary to increase tuition<br />\nby more than 14 percent. Said<br />\nPeifer, \"We will have to look<br />\ninto the operating expenses of<br />\nthe University\" to see what cost<br />\nincreases warrant such a large<br />\ntuition increase. Dean Hall was<br />\nnot prepared to produce such<br />\nfigures Wednesday, but said after<br />\nhis meeting with the Council<br />\nthat in real terms, tuition costs<br />\nwould be about the same as they<br />\nwere last year.<br />\nSaid Hall: \"Even when you<br />\nhold still, there are automatic<br />\nincreases in costs: fuel, salaries,<br />\npaper, books. The University is<br />\nin the midst of finalizing a<br />\nbudget.<br />\nBudgets have been<br />\nscrutinized in all terms.\"<br />\nDean Hall also affirmed that<br />\nin spite of recent disclosures by<br />\na number of Ivy League schools<br />\nthat ability to pay is a factor in<br />\ndeciding who will or will not be<br />\naccepted for admission, Hopkins<br />\nwill remain blind to ability<br />\nto pay in terms of selecting a<br />\nclass. He says that he does not<br />\nexpect 'changes in tuition or<br />\nfinancial aid to have any affect<br />\non the admissions process.<br />\nHall said that in the coming<br />\nweeks Hopkins will be consulting with other schools in determining how to deal with new<br />\nfinancial problems in need-based<br />\nprograms.<br /><br />\nShortage OfBook Spaces Prompts<br /><br />\nProposals To Enlarge MSE Library<br />\nBY BRUCE ALPERT<br />\nSusan Martin, the director<br />\nof the Milton S.

BG&amp;E requested $199 million in<br />\nrevenues, but only received $99.2 million, the largest rate increase<br />\nin the company's history. What this means to the consumer is<br />\nthat the average electricity user's bill will rise $3.70 while the<br />\naverage gas user will pay $2.40 per month.<br />\nThe State PuPlic Service Commission's decision means the<br />\naverage customer's monthly bill for 600 kilowatt hours of electricity will jump by 9.2 percent to $42.27. Gas bills for 90 therms<br />\nwill increase $2.41 to $45.95\u2014 an additional 4.9 percent.<br />\nTo lighten this load, the customer's base monthly charge<br />\nhas been reduced. The charge will drop from $4.14 to $2.69 a<br />\nmonth for electricity and from $5.02 to $2.85 for gas, a decrease<br />\nto help the poor.<br />\nDr. Matthew Tayback, Director of the State Office on<br />\nAging, is afraid that higher energy rates and aid cutbacks will<br />\nforce senior citizens to choose \"between the cost of drugs, food<br />\nand fuel.\" At the same time, the cost of public services and<br />\nMedicare copayment fees will increase.

Two days later the<br />\nyouth returned to the same<br />\nprofessor and turned himself in.<br />\nCampus police were called in to<br />\nmake the arrest and file the<br />\nwarrant. Because of the seriousness of the crime, the youth was<br />\ncharged and will be tried as an<br />\nadult.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins security<br />\nmade the arrest they immediately turned the matter over to<br />\nBaltimore City police. There has<br />\nbeen no follow-up into the case<br />\nbecause Major Larkin stated that<br />\n\"we do not want to interfere<br />\nwith the city for fear of jeapordizing evidence.\" Hopkins security limits itself to preventive<br />\nand preliminary security measures and has little power to<br />\ncontinue with a case once it has<br />\nbeen handed over to city police.<br />\nConcern over the latest<br />\nincident has raised questions on<br />\nboth security and victim assistance.

Claire King, an<br />\nOutreach Coordinator and counselor at the White House, is<br />\njoining forces with the Baltimore<br />\nCounty Center for Victims of<br />\nSexual Assault in planning a<br /><br />\nSexual Assault Awareness Day<br />\nto be held on April 7 at Hopkins.

For while<br />\nit may be that the cuts have performed<br />\nsome long-overdue trimming of domestic<br />\nspending, things have reached the point<br />\nwhere a basic American ideal\u2014the opportunity for advancement via education\u2014is<br />\nnot merely being threatened but eliminated. It is not simply that the very poor<br />\nare losing their shot at quality higher<br />\neducation, an evil implicit in the cuts from<br />\nthe outset; the category of the victimized<br />\nis growing to include those in higher<br />\neconomic brackets. Hopkins, for example,<br />\nwhile it has pledged itself not to join<br />\nWesleyan in what appears to be a trend, has<br />\nannounced a 14 percent tuition hike for<br />\nnext year. Couple this with the 10 percent<br />\ncut in financial aid instituted by the<br />\nUniversity this year, and you find that the<br />\nstudent in need of aid is facing what<br />\namounts to a 25 percent jump in tuition.<br /><br />\nThus, while Hopkins may not deny admission to such a student, it very probably will<br />\nnot be able to extend him the money he<br />\nneeds to come here.<br />\nThe point is that the Reagan cuts<br />\nhave acquired an inexorable media image as<br />\n\"the beginning of a new era,\" the end of<br />\nthe New Deal. While the cuts undeniably<br />\nare the beginning of a necessary era of<br />\nbudget austerity, they must not be allowed<br />\nto roll back some of the basic rights safeguarded by the so-called New Deal era.<br />\nPerhaps the most important of these rights<br />\nis the opportunity for quality higher<br />\neducation, for a democracy is not a democracy without this most basic form of equal<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nWe are just now starting to hear<br />\nabout further cuts being contemplated by<br />\nthe Reagan administration. How much<br />\nfurther can they go before almost no one<br />\ncan afford a higher education? The first<br />\nround of cuts may not have affected many<br />\npeople you or I know here at Hopkins, but<br />\nthe next round most certainly will. It<br />\ncould even be us. And if it's not, we still<br />\ndon't want to be the last generation of<br />\nAmericans who had the luxury of expecting to complete a college education.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nGruntin'Good Fun<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nAh, the joys of the usual<br />\n'rush week debates!' Did it ever<br />\noccur to anyone here that the<br />\nprinciple objects of rush week<br />\n(the freshmen) never seem to<br />\ncomplain about it? Why is it<br />\n.that we wise and sober upperclassmen are so solicitous of the<br />\nfreshmen at this time of the<br />\nyear, and at no other?<br />\nDoes Robin Johnson seriously believe that stripper<br />\nnights teach freshman 'contempt<br />\nfor women'? Are they that<br />\nstupid and naive? The only<br />\npeople deserving of contempt<br />\nare those who use the frats in<br />\norder to launch a moral crusade<br />\nagainst the practices which they<br />\nfind personally distasteful (and<br />\nwhich don't concern them at<br />\nall), while at the same time<br />\ncondescendingly flutter their<br />\nhands in anxiety-ridden concern<br />\nfor the poor defenseless freshman. I might point out that, as<br />\nRobin is a junior, as I am, it is<br />\ntechnically illegal for her to<br />\nconsume hard liquor in this<br />\nstate, to say -nothing of the<br />\nfreshmen. (Only people 21,<br />\nusually seniors, and over enjoy<br />\nthat privilege. But the question<br />\nis not one of legality.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCertainly the frats could use<br />\nsome loose monitoring, but the<br />\nfreshmen are not obligated to<br />\nattend such parties. If they<br />\nwant to get sick, it is up to<br />\nthem. College is a time when<br />\nyou must accept responsibility<br />\nfor your actions, and fraternities<br />\nare part of that education<br />\nprocess. It's about time that<br />\nsomeone here tried to look at<br />\neducation (and growing up) as a<br />\nprocess which involves more<br />\nthan the classroom and maybe<br />\nthe SAC. While I am not a<br /><br />\nmember of any fraternity (in,<br />\nfact, I believe I was Phi Psi's first<br />\nblackball several years ago), I<br />\ncan see the value of their continued existence as a significant<br />\n,force at Hopkins. The value of<br />\nsuch criticisms as Johnson's, at<br />\nbest, would be to censor the<br />\n:behavior of some basically<br />\n. blameless people\u2014not to mention the fact that the morally<br />\nsmug (who shall remain nameless) would gain the satisfaction<br />\nof \u2022knowing that they have<br />\nstruck another blow at \"licentiousness\" and \"vice.\" On the<br />\nother hand, we run the risk of<br />\ndestroying a potentially significant educational experience for<br />\nHopkins students, dividing the<br />\nHopkins community, and removing one of the few sources of<br />\ngenuine fun and chaos on this<br />\notherwise conservative, stuffy,<br />\nand boring campus. I haven't<br />\nheard about the hooker raffles,<br />\nbut it sounds fun to me, as well r<br />\nas depraved, decadent, and incredibly healthy.<br />\nDavid Hurwitz<br /><br />\nNye To Perfection<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nI wish to thank Emily Nye<br />\nfor her article,\"Mental Self-Help<br />\nGuide for Students,\" in which<br />\nshe pointed out many simple<br />\nremedies for all of our not-sotrivial hang-ups. I thought the<br />\narticle was informative, helpful<br />\nand witty. Only her point which<br />\nsuggested television reruns instead of old movies made me<br />\nquestion her advice. I won't<br />\ndeny that the simple and hypnotic nature of television programming can be helfpul in<br />\nrelieving stress. But, by recommending reruns over beautiful<br />\nclassics, Ms. Nye is not being<br /><br />\n_ \u2022<br />\nhonest. Anyone who would go<br />\nto see an old film just to say,\"I<br />\nsaw that old film,\" is fooling<br />\nhimself. I am sure anyone else<br />\nwould profit more from a<br />\nviewing of \"Casablanca\" than<br />\nany rerun of \"Three's Company.\"<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nFredric Steinberg<br /><br />\nN-L On Trial<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nUnfortunately, a clarification of the News-Letter advertising policy seems to be in<br />\norder. Even more unfortunately, this classification must be<br />\ndirected at members of the<br />\nNews-Letter editorial board so<br />\nthat further misinformation will<br />\nnot be espoused by the EditorIn-Chief and Arts Editor and so<br />\nthat campus groups and outside<br />\norganizations will not be confused. I refer to last week's<br />\nentirely justified letter by Sports<br />\nEditor Steve Eisenberg and Joe<br />\nLevine's reply.<br />\nThe advertising deadline has<br />\nalways been and will remain<br />\n5:00 Wednesday afternoons.<br />\nThe B/ossius ads were inserted<br />\nafter the deadline, without the<br />\nknowledge of the Business Managers, an occurrence that simply<br />\nshouldn't have taken place. The<br />\nfact that these ads were inserted,<br />\nat all, infuriates me for several<br />\nreasons:<br />\n1) I had been trying to find<br />\nsome space for a FILM SERIES<br />\nad that was submitted late and<br />\nwould, thus, have been subject<br />\nto additional charges\u2014more<br />\nmoney for the financially<br />\nstrapped News-Letter. The ad<br />\nspace given to Blossius could<br />\npossibly have been consolidated<br />\ninto a smaller ad for the movie.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LITTER/ PAGE 5<br /><br />\nN-L Washes Its Dirty Laundry In Public Sink<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\n2) Campus Notes were<br />\nREMOVED in order that one of<br />\nthe Blossius ads could be inserted. Since I had guaranteed<br />\nthat one of the \"bumped\" notes<br />\nwould run, I felt responsible. It<br />\nalso makes for bad business<br />\npolicy. Campus groups can be<br />\nassured that if their notes are<br />\nreceived on time, in the proper<br />\nform, they will be run.<br />\n3) Mr. Levine's \"forgiveable<br />\ndonation\" is UNFORGIVEABLE. The News-Letter, as Joe<br />\nknows, is in no position to be<br />\ndonating things to its own<br />\nmembers or anyone else for that<br />\nmatter.<br />\n4) \"It is not unreasonable<br />\nfor the News-Letter, at its<br />\ndiscretion, to extend a certain<br />\namount of charity to a school<br />\nevent.\" I ask Mr. Levine to<br />\ndefine the News-Letter. Is it<br />\nhim? Is it me? Is it an Ed.<br />\nBoard? Or is it a combination<br /><br />\nthereof? I, as Business Manager,<br />\nfind it highly unreasonable for<br />\nany ads to be given away.<br />\nRegarding charity, the only<br />\ncharity that the News-Letter<br />\nactually ever gives to, as Eisenberg asserts, is \"a select group<br />\nof people.\" Unfortunately, free<br />\nspace has also been given to<br />\nother campus groups by the<br />\nBusiness Managers themselves.<br />\n(the California Suite ad of last<br />\nweek). I, personally, object to<br />\ngiving away free ad space for ads<br />\nother than personal messages. In<br />\nother words, I object to the<br />\nCalifornia Suite ad. A decision<br />\nclarifying this policy should be<br />\nmade by the Editorial Board. I,<br />\nas Business Manager, try to<br />\nfollow a policy of trying to be<br />\nobjective and fair. I would hope<br />\nthat the News-Letter will adopt<br />\nthis policy and/or clarify it.<br />\nAs further clarification,<br />\nBlossius would not have been<br />\nthe recipient of any free ads<br /><br />\nunless the Business Managers<br />\nwere informed and arrangements<br />\nfor payment of the publicity<br />\nposters had been made (they<br />\nwere done at the Gatehouse.).<br />\nIn general, free ad space will not<br />\nbe given to any group, ever,<br />\nwithout the approval of both the<br />\nBusiness Managers and the<br />\nEditor-in-Chief and the demonstration of real need. If any<br />\nfurther violations of the \"no<br />\ncharity\" policy occur, the NewsLetter obviously has no need for<br />\na Business Manager. I'll join<br />\nSteve in the ranks of the unemployed.<br />\nAlan Karras<br /><br />\nHop-Cop Glop<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nI would like to express my<br />\ndismay concerning another campus publication, the HOP-GOP<br /><br />\nBeware The Facade Squad<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nlaugh, and then move on to<br />\nother business. The people to<br />\nwatch out for are the ones who<br />\npreface their stories with lines<br />\nlike, \"Wanna hear something<br />\nreally funny?\" and then proceed<br />\nto relate observations which are<br />\nusually wry or inoffensive, cynical or vapid, but hardly ever<br />\nYour best weapon<br />\nfunny.<br />\nagainst bad humor is stonefaced<br />\nsilence, or better yet, loud<br />\nsarcastic guffawing.

If oral fixation is the most common form<br />\nof affectation, then pedanticism<br />\nUsually<br />\nis a close second.<br />\npedanticisim is espoused by<br />\nthose most insecure about their<br />\nintellectual Abilities. Pedanticism comes in a variety of styles:<br />\nmusic (\"Who played clavinet on<br />\nthe original version of 'The<br />\nRapper'?\"), sports (\"Longest<br />\ntime between haircuts for a<br />\nNational League relief pitcher?\"), and movies (\"Actor who<br />\nplayed lead orangutan in Battle<br />\nfor the Establishment of a<br />\nFree-Enterprise Economy on the<br />\nPlanet of the Apes?\"), to name<br />\nbut a few. Concerning academic<br /><br />\npedanticism: the best way to<br />\ntell if you're really relevant or<br />\njust talking through your hat is<br />\nto speak up in class. If the<br />\nprofessor interrupts his lecture<br />\nto challenge your statement,<br />\nyou're home free. If he says,<br />\n\"Now that's a good point,\" and<br />\ncontinues, forget it.

She was moved to<br />\nwrite this after learning of a<br />\nrecent rape here on campus. For<br />\nobvious reasons, she has chosen<br />\nto withhold her name.<br />\nI will tell you what it is like<br />\nto be raped. Strange to say, the<br />\nsexual assault itself was the least<br />\nfrightening part. During that<br />\ntime I could still pray and hope<br />\nthat after it was over he would<br />\ndecide not to kill me. And in<br />\nmy case, something in my loud<br />\nand fervent prayer did frustrate<br />\nhim. Because of this, I was<br />\nnot actually \"raped\" in the legal<br />\nsense which requires actual intercourse. Legalities, however, did<br />\nnot enter into my thoughts<br />\nduring those 20 minutes on a<br />\nrainy Sunday afternoon. The<br />\nknife, the fear, and the innocence were enough to change,<br />\npermanently, a 16 year old's<br />\nperception of life, love, and<br />\nmen.<br />\nI grew up that day. The<br />\nexperience has become incorporated into my every action. I<br />\nlearned of man's inhumanity to<br />\nman abruptly, rather than in the<br />\nevolutionary pattern of maturation. Instead, this lesson of<br />\nlife Was forced upon me at 16. I<br />\nwas an innocent with a view of<br /><br />\nlife directly descended from<br />\nRousseau. No longer.<br />\nDealing with family and<br />\nfriends was more difficult than<br />\ndealing with the police, who<br />\nalthough they tried to be sympathetic, succeeded only in being<br />\nsterile, coldly probing, making<br />\nme recall every last detail of an<br />\nevent I wanted desperately to<br />\nforget.

Although I<br />\nwas covered with mud and<br />\nleaves, my desire to wash<br />\nstemmed more from my compulsion to wash every trace of him<br />\nfrom me\u2014to try to purify myself<br />\nonce more. My mother understood this, while my father was<br />\ntoo angry at him to be compassionate. Aside from this, their<br />\nfeelings and actions were mixtures of possessiveness (protectiveness) and being distant, trying to allow me to work things<br />\nout for myself.

This recommendation will probably be a call to<br />\nrenovate the existing dormitories<br />\nand construct new dormitores,<br />\nupperclass housing and a dining<br />\nhall to the west of Baker Dormitory. Also, Muller will probably<br />\nrecommend renovation of some<br />\noff-campus apartments so that<br />\nadditional students could be<br />\nhoused.<br />\nDespite a proposal from an<br />\nadministrative committee recommending that dorm rooms be<br />\nrenovated<br />\ninto<br />\nfour-person<br /><br />\nsuites, each with a common area<br />\nand bathroom, the present housing proposal will not significantly alter the design of dorm<br />\nrooms. Double and single rooms<br />\nwill be separate with doors<br />\nopening into a hallway. Private<br />\nbaths will not exist, but there<br />\nwill be bathroom facilities on<br />\neach floor.<br />\nSome consideration had<br />\nbeen given to constructing a<br />\ncommon area, the size of two<br />\ndouble bedrooms, on each floor.<br />\nHowever, cost factors and a<br />\nStudent Council recommendation that seemed to indicate that<br />\nthese areas would not be utilized<br />\ndecreased the attractiveness of<br /><br />\nthis plan. Instead there will be<br />\nlarge common spaces for all<br />\ndormitory residents located in<br />\nvarious places within the dorm<br />\ncomplex.<br />\nMuller's recommendation is<br />\nalso expected to include a<br />\nproposal to renovate the heating<br />\nsystem, install acoustic buffers<br />\nto decrease noise levels, and<br />\nreplace the dorm furniture.<br />\nRenovation of off-campus<br />\napartments will probably include<br />\nless double spaces than previously recommended, but many of<br />\nthe large single bedrooms will<br />\nstill be converted into double<br />\nbedrooms.<br /><br />\nAdvising Process Varies Among Universities<br />\nBY RAJI MULUKUTLA<br />\nAccording to a recent survey, Hopkins students are not<br />\nhappy with the current system<br />\nof advising in use here. In an<br />\nattempt to find out how the<br />\nsystem can be reorganized in<br />\norder to better serve the student<br />\nbody, the Student Council Education Committe has been collecting information about advising at various other universities.<br />\nAt Dartmouth College, for<br />\ninstance, each freshman has a<br />\nfaculty advisor who remains<br />\nwith them for three terms.<br />\nLater, as students decide on<br />\ntheir area of academic interest,<br />\ndepartmental advisors assume<br />\nThey<br />\ngreater responsibility.<br />\nprovide information and help in<br />\nthe selection of a major field of<br />\nstudy. In addition to faculty<br />\nand departmental advisors, there<br />\nare undergraduate advisors within each dormitory. Their job is<br />\nto orient new students and<br />\nprovide informal but practical<br />\nadvise to freshmen.<br />\nThe system at Stanford<br />\nUniversity is very different from<br />\nthat which is in use at Hopkins.<br />\nTheir Academic Information<br />\nCenter, which is largely con-<br /><br />\ncerned with the advising of<br />\nundergraduates with undeclared<br />\nthe<br />\nadministrates<br />\nmajors,<br />\nGeneral Academic advising program. Each freshman is assigned<br />\na general academic advisor (who<br />\nis usually retained through the<br />\nsophomore year) based on preliminary interest in one of the<br />\nmajor academic areas. Also,<br />\neach freshman residence is<br />\nserved by an advising team<br />\ncomposed of 5 to 25 faculty and<br />\nstaff members.<br />\nEach team<br />\nincludes at least one representative of each academic area.<br />\nWhen a student declares a major,<br />\nhe or she changes to an advisor<br />\nwithin the major department.<br />\nStanford also has an Advising Associate Program, which<br />\nis very similar to the Student<br />\nAdvising Program at Hopkins.<br />\nFinally, they have two<br />\nsupplementary programs, the<br />\npre-professional advising program and the \"on-call\" general<br />\nadvising program. The \"on-call\"<br />\nadvisors, based in the Academic<br />\nInformation Center, are available<br />\nto all undergraduates on a<br />\nwalk-in or appointment basis.<br />\nAt least in the freshman<br />\nyear, the system at Yale University is similar to Hopkins'.<br />\nEach student has a Freshman<br /><br />\nLibrary Receives Grant<br />\nForInformation Systems<br />\nThe Milton S.

Martin, the grant<br />\nwill be used to continue the<br />\nconversion of information in the<br />\ncard catalog to computerreadable form and to acquire<br />\ncomputer equipment sufficient<br />\nfor a local computer-accessible<br />\ncatalog. The grant will also<br />\nenable the Library to begin<br />\nexploration of videodisc technology as a preservation medium<br />\nand to use telecopying devices<br />\nfor increased resource sharing<br />\namong the University's libraries.<br />\nIt is hoped that within a few<br />\nyears, a Library user will be able<br />\nto check the catalog from an<br /><br />\noffice or home computer terminal, request available material<br />\nwith a computer, command,<br />\norder other material through<br />\neither the Acquisitions Department or Interlibrary Loan, and<br />\nreceive books or photocopied<br />\nperiodical articles by means of a<br />\ndocument delivery service from<br />\nthe Library to the departmental<br />\noffice. Computerized cataloging<br />\nsince 1974 'provides the Library<br />\nwith an initial data base of<br />\n150,000 records.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University is a member of the Research<br />\nLibraries Group, and the bibliographic data base resulting from<br />\nthis effort will be added to the<br />\nResearch Libraries Information<br />\nNetwork (RUN) data base,<br />\nto facilitate resource sharing and<br />\ncollection development among<br />\npeer institutions.<br /><br />\nCounselor, the equivalent of a<br />\nstudent advisor, and a Faculty<br />\nProgram Advisor.<br />\nOne difference is that each faculty<br />\nadvisor is only assigned 4 to 6<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nIn their sophomore year,<br />\nhowever, students at Yale<br />\nchoose their own advisors according to individual interests.<br />\nSophomores<br />\nmajoring<br />\nin<br />\nmathematics<br />\nand<br />\nnatural<br />\nsciences and all juniors and<br />\nseniors must have their schedules<br />\napproved by the Director of<br />\nUndergraduate Studies in their<br />\nmajor.<br />\nOne of the last schools from<br />\nwhich the Education Committee<br />\nhas received information to date<br /><br />\nis Princeton University.<br />\nAll<br />\nfreshmen at Princeton are assigned, in groups of 10 to 18, to<br />\na Resident Advisor. The RA is a<br />\nstudent advisor who lives in<br />\nthe same dorm as the member of<br />\nthe group assigned to him,<br />\nTwo or three RA groups are<br />\nassigned to an Academic or<br />\nfaculty advisor.<br />\nThus, the<br />\nmatching of students and advisors is done by common<br />\ngeographical location of students<br />\nand their RAs, and not by area<br />\nof academic interest,<br />\nAlso available to students<br />\nare the more general resources of<br />\nthe Central Board of Advisors,<br />\nwhich is made up of 10 faculty<br />\nadvisors, a director, and a<br /><br />\nchairperson responsible for the<br />\ngeneral supervision of the academic program of freshmen.<br />\n.Sophomores request advisors by<br />\ntheir area of academic interest.<br />\nJuniors and seniors are advised<br />\nby the faculty members of the<br />\ndepartments they have joined.<br />\nThe Education Committee<br />\nis now in the process of reviewing the information it has<br />\nreceived from these and other<br />\ncolleges.<br />\n\"This information has been<br />\nextremely useful to us in that it<br />\nenables us to compare our<br />\nadvisory. system with those of<br />\nother universities,\" says cornmittee chairperson Doug Fellman.<br /><br />\nSC To Send Letter To Owen<br />\nAbout Effects OfPlus/Minus<br />\nBY BRUCE ALPERT<br />\nThe Student Council voted<br />\nWednesday night to send a letter<br />\nto George Owen, Dean of<br />\nHomewood Faculties, requesting<br />\nthat the University monitor the<br />\neffects of plus/minus grading<br />\nupon its implementation here in<br />\nSeptember.<br />\nThe letter states that \"Because information about the<br />\nconcrete effects of a plus/minus<br />\ngrading system are sparse, we<br />\nthink it is in the best interest of<br />\nthe University to maintain complete records of how plus/minus<br />\naffects students, their GPAs,and<br />\nrelated aspects of Johns Hopkins. This information will be<br />\nuseful not only in evaluating the<br />\nimpact of plus/minus at Hopkins<br />\nbut also to other colleges and<br />\nuniversities contemplating a similar change.\"<br />\nThe letter was introduced<br />\nby Doug Fellman, chairman of<br />\nthe Council's Education Committee, for that committee's<br />\nconsideration on Monday night.<br />\nThe committee at first voted to<br />\nreject sending such a letter to<br />\nCouncil, but later rescinded that<br />\nvote. The letter was introduced<br />\nto the full Council on Wednesday night and passed easily.<br />\nThe question of Student<br />\nCouncil action on plus/minus<br />\ngrading in the light of the<br /><br />\nAcademic Council's decision to<br />\nimplement such a system at<br />\nHopkins was introduced late last<br />\nsemester and deferred until<br />\nJanuary. At that time, Council<br />\nvoted to send the matter back to<br />\nthe Education Committee where<br />\nit has been for the last two<br />\nwecks.<br />\nAt Monday's meeting, no<br />\nclear opinion was voiced by the<br />\nconCommittee<br />\nEducation<br />\ncerning future Council action on<br />\nthe question. A Committee vote<br />\nrecommending that the Council<br />\ncontinue to express its objection<br />\nto plus/minus grading resulted in<br />\na tie. It was finally decided by<br />\nthat Committee that it should<br /><br />\nrescind its earlier vote not to<br />\nsend the letter to Dean Owen to<br />\nthe Council, and that it should<br />\nleave other action to the discretion of Council.<br />\nIn addition to the letter,<br />\nCouncil is currently considering<br />\na motion that would express its<br />\ncontinued<br />\ndisapproval<br />\nof<br />\nplus/minus grading. Proponents<br />\nof this amendment fear that,<br />\nshould Council fail to express its<br />\nopinion on this matter, it would<br />\nseem as though Council were<br />\nabandoning this issue as it would<br />\nnot affect any of its members<br />\npersonally.

Thus,<br />\nHopkins could be directly supporting corporations whose policies don't adhere to the prevailing morality.<br /><br />\nThe Public Investment<br />\nMorality Committee (PIMC), a<br />\nStudent Council committee, has<br />\nbeen given the task of monitoring the moral and social impact<br />\nof these policies. PIMC has<br />\nthree major tasks. First, PIMC is<br />\nto inform Hopkins students of<br />\nthe activities of the corporations<br />\nin which the University owns<br />\nstock.<br />\nA second task is to<br />\nascertain the opinion of the<br />\nstudent body regarding the<br />\nmoral and social impact of these<br />\nactivities.

There is not one<br />\nsources of funds include alumni nation in the world\u2014not one<br /><br />\n\u2014that is truly communist, in the<br />\nsense that Karl Marx meant it: a<br />\nclassless society, the means of<br />\nproduction being owned by the<br />\nworkers and all decisions made<br />\nby them on a completely democratic basis. Those totalitarian<br />\nstates that call themselves Communist (the most prominent<br />\nbeing the Soviet Union) merely<br />\nmake communism look bad.<br />\nThe reason why proletarian<br />\nrevolution so often goes awry is<br />\nthat no genuinely communist<br />\ncountry can survive in a world<br />\ncontrolled by capitalists. Capitalism is based on production<br />\nand exchange of commodities,<br />\nand it requires growth; its<br />\ngrowth is derived from the<br />\nuncompsensated surplus labor of<br />\nthe workers. Communism, on<br />\nthe other hand, involves production of things that people need,<br />\nby and for the people, rather<br />\nthan by wage-labor for the profit<br />\nof the capitalist. There is no<br />\nneed for exploitation of workers. The two economic systems<br />\ncannot coexist. Until the capitalist system is completely overthrown, communism will never<br />\nsucceed.<br />\nThe hypocrisy of upholding<br />\n\"democracy\" by trying to wipe<br />\nout \"communism\" is all too<br />\nglaring these days. Scott Shires,<br />\nin his article on El Salvador<br />\n(2/5/82), claims that \"The junta<br />\nholds the only promise, at<br />\npresent, of getting on the road<br />\nto democracy.\" This is like<br />\nsaying that the key to racial<br />\nequality is segregated schooling.<br />\n\"Authoritarian\" (fascist) government, today eagerly backed by<br />\nU.S. capitalists, is the antithesis<br />\nof democracy. Of course, it<br />\nmight serve to usher in democracy insofar as it could incite a<br />\nworkers' revolution. Unfortunately, that is probably not what<br />\nMr. Shires meant.<br /><br />\nhave decided that going to trial<br />\nwould have been a trauma for<br />\nThe whole dirty thing<br />\nme.<br />\nwould have to be told and retold<br />\nin front of strangers. And I<br />\nwould have to see him again, and<br />\nremember; in a way, the words<br />\nof the story could never evoke<br />\nhow I_ felt that day. I am<br />\nfortunate that that never occurred, but it is true that no<br />\nmatter how far one runs one<br />\ncannot escape the past, and I am<br />\n, no exception. Certain thoughts,<br />\npeople, places or events can still<br />\ncause that particular mix of fear,<br />\nhatred, and confusion to well up<br />\nonce more inside me. The<br /><br />\nHe then warns us: \"As an<br />\nexample of what happens when<br />\nguerillas triumph, the jails of<br />\nNicaragua are so full that warehouses have been converted into<br />\njails.\" I offer another example<br />\nof what happens when guerillas<br />\ntriumph:<br />\nover two hundred<br />\nyears ago, guerillas fought it out<br />\nwith the foreign government<br />\nthat was tyrannically running<br />\ntheir small country from overseas, and won\u2014the result was the<br />\nUnited States of America. (Oh,<br />\ndon't get me wrong: I am no<br />\nsupporter of the U.S. government. Although my human<br />\nrights are respected here probably more than they would be<br />\nanywhere else, the. U.S. has<br />\ndropped more bombs, killed<br />\nmore people and committed<br />\nmore blatantly hypocritical acts<br />\nof internal and external terrorism than any other government.)<br /><br />\nrecent rape in Dunning Hall is<br />\namong those events. I, too,<br />\nhave been a witness to situations involving trespassers on<br />\nthis campus. Then I think back<br />\nto that time only two and a half<br />\nyears ago, and decide (in all<br />\nsanity) that if it every happened<br />\nagain, I would hope that the<br />\nrapist would kill me when it was<br />\nover. Or maybe before.<br /><br />\nMr. Shires' last paragraph is<br />\nan exquisite display of imperialist-capitalist rhetoric. He says,<br />\nin a nutshell, that what El<br />\nSalvador needs is \"economic<br />\ndevelopment\" (read: \"exploitation\") by the U.S., and that<br />\n\"leftist victory\" is a nice idea<br />\nbut won't work.

Robin, I<br />\nagree with what you said, a small<br />\npart of it anyway. However, I<br />\ndo not feel you are entirely<br />\ncognizant of the reality of the<br />\nsituation. Fraternities are more<br />\nthan just sex, drugs, and rock<br />\nand roll. You said \"Fraternities<br />\nare supposed to be organizations<br />\ndedicated to brotherhood.\" I<br />\nsay they are. Having been an<br />\nofficer in one of the largest<br />\nfraternities, TEP, for the past 2<br />\nyears, I feel that I am much<br />\nmore qualified to make a judgment about the existence of<br />\nbrotherhood in our Greek system. Robin, fraternities are<br />\nbased on brotherhood. You, as<br />\nan outsider, can not know what<br />\nit means to experience fraternal<br />\nbrotherhood, simply because it<br />\nis an intangible.<br />\nThis is part of the reason<br />\nwhy I am responding to your<br />\nletter. Much of what you said is<br />\nseriously misleading and contemptable. Robin, it was not<br />\nfair of you to accuse us of<br />\nmisogyny (yes, I looked it up;it<br />\nmeans hatred of women). I<br />\nwent to a stripper night as a<br />\nfreshman, mostly out of curiosity, but do you really think I<br />\nhate you? Personally, I do not<br />\ncondone the raffling off of a<br />\nwoman for any reason. I would<br />\nalso like to state that we of<br />\nthe Tau Epsilon Phi Fraternity<br />\nhave never had a stripper night<br />\nand never will. We believe there<br />\nis more to life than just getting<br />\nlaid (and as soon as we figure<br />\nout what it is, we'll let you<br />\nknow.).

So, by carefully selecting<br />\nsix one-credit science seminars,<br />\nthe H&amp;S major can easily fulfill<br />\nhis science requirements without<br />\never learning anything.

Nevertheless, the attempted<br />\ncoup d'etat that startled Madrid last February 23 presented a surprise I was not prepared to deal with.<br /><br />\nby Martin Carlson<br />\nAt five o'ciocic in the afternoon on that day, the<br />\nPrado Museum closed its doors, and my art history class<br />\nin the El Graco rooms ended. Since the weather was<br />\nalready fairly warm and the Castilian sky was as blue as<br />\never, a friend and I opted to take the your walk back to<br />\nour respective dormitories instead of suffocating in the<br />\nMetro. We headed uphill past the Cortes (the Spanis<br />\nParliament), down the Gran Via (the Main Drag), then<br />\nover to the Ciudad Universitaria (the University of<br />\nMadrid's campus). Before separating, we stood on the<br />\ncorner in front of the Minesterio del Aire (Air Force<br />\nHeadquarters) to talk for about fifteen minutes.<br />\nIt was about seven when I finally arrived home to<br />\nmy dormitory room and buried my nose in a fat Spanish<br />\nnovel about a provocative adulteress. I figured that I<br />\ncould finish the description of the Don Juan type who<br />\nseduced her before I ate dinner at nine thirty.<br />\nI had just become settled on my bed when in<br />\nbarged my friend Pablo, who instantly destroyed my<br />\nJabbering in almost incomprehensible<br />\ntranquility.<br />\nSpanish, he reported that a right-wing Guardia Civil<br />\n(Spanish paramilitary) group led by Lieutenant Colonel<br />\nAntonio Tejero had burst into the Cortes chamber of<br />\nrepresentatives while the elected officials were voting on<br />\nthe nomination of Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo for president.<br />\nThe Guardia's intention: to overthrow the Spanish<br />\ngovernment. I believed not a word Pablo said, since my<br />\nSpanish buddies were forever trying to pull my leg; yet<br />\nhe convinced me to listen to the radio broadcasts so that<br />\nI could verify the report myself.<br />\nHearing was believing, but all of us that had<br />\ngathered around the tiny radio remained extremely<br />\nconfused. Many students expected all forms of communication to be cut off, yet even in the Cortes itself<br />\nboth a television camera and a microphone remained to<br />\nrecord the events for the Spanish people.<br />\nReacting like the typically naive Yankee, I<br />\nimmediately proposed running down to the Cortes to<br />\ninvestigate the situation; but the Spaniards rejected such<br />\nrash stupidity. In fact, it was as if they had sixth sense<br />\nof what to do in a state of siege. Most of the guys in my<br />\ndormitory attempted to telephone their homes in the<br />\nprovinces to discover if the Guardia Civil had seized<br />\ncontrol outside the capital. Those fortunate enough to<br />\nown cars filled them with gas and packed suitcases so<br />\nthey would be able to escape the city if violence were to<br />\nerupt. Not a soul dared step outside the confines of the<br />\ndormitory.<br />\nBy eight thirty the busy intersection in front of<br />\nthe dormitory was deserted, save occasional police<br />\nmotorcycles that flashed through the night. The students already had begun to imagine the consequences of<br />\na successful coup d'etat. I might have been deported<br />\nfrom the country, but worse yet, classes at the University of Madrid might have been cancelled in an attempt<br />\nto keep the \"radical\" students from protesting a rightwing takeover. There might have been some sort of<br />\npurge of the Communist Party, of which some of my<br />\nfriends were members. Newspaper editors, writers,<br />\npoets, educators, and labor leaders might have been<br />\nseverely punished. But few dared mention the worst<br />\npossible consequence: another Spanish civil war with<br />\nthe world having to choose sides between a Soviet Left<br />\nand a fascist Right.<br />\nIn response to Tejero's takeover, General Jaime<br />\nMilans del Bosch in Valencia placed his southeastern<br />\nSpanish province in a state of siege. He suspended all<br />\npolitical and public liberties and prohibited gatherings of<br />\nmore than four people. Tejero and his Guardia Civil<br />\ncronies in Madrid awaited even more military commanders in the provinces to back their operation.<br /><br />\nYet later that night King Juan Carlos I dealt a<br />\nblow to the usurpers when he appeared on Spanish<br />\ntelevision. Outfitted in his complete military garb to<br />\nemphasize his role as chief of the armed forces, he<br />\nrefused to succumb to the ultraderechistas, the extreme<br />\nRight. \"The Crown,\" he announced,\"will never tolerate<br />\nthe forced interruption of the democratic process<br />\ndecided upon by the Spanish people.\"<br />\nAt that I went to bed, totally exhausted after a<br />\nday of such tension. The following morning, the dormitory continued to buzz as the students remained glued<br />\nto their radios, slurping their cafe and gobbling their<br />\npan. No other province had fallen, and the immediate<br />\nthreat of danger had passed. By the end of the day,<br />\nTejero was under control, and the government had<br />\nrestored constitutional order.<br />\nThe attempted coup even affected the often<br />\nout-of-tune americanos. The day following the event,<br />\nexcitement filled the Instituto Internacional as students<br />\nall compared notes and asked each other, \"Where were<br />\nyou when the coup broke out?\" Most of us were<br />\nconcerned about our adopted country and did not want<br />\nto see it collapse under the pressure of revolutionary<br />\nforces. On the other hand, we recognized our impotence<br />\nwhen we realized that we would be leaving Spain in a<br />\nfew months. Had the coup been successful, the native<br />\nSpaniards\u2014not the visiting American students\u2014would<br />\nhave had to suffer the consequences of a repressive<br />\nregime.<br />\nThe ordeal was more than perplexing, especially<br />\nconsidering it all happened in Spanish. Comments and<br />\nevaluations bombarded me from all sides, but two<br />\nquestions seemed to recur: One: Colonel Tejera had<br />\npreviously been involved in an attempted coup in 1978.<br />\nHe concocted the Galaxy conspiracy in a Madrid cafe in<br />\nmy neighborhood and called for the seizure and murder<br />\nof the first post-Franco president, Adolfo Suarez. The<br />\nplans fell through and Tejero escaped with only a mild<br />\nslap on the wrist. How could the government allow such<br />\na crackpot to return to active duty in an important<br />\nleadership role following such a fiasco? Two: Could a<br />\nsudden overthrow of the government occur in the<br />\nUnited States? The Spanish university students were<br />\nforever pressing me with this question. My answer was<br />\ngenerally,\"No, not like the one Tejero tried to pull off.\"<br />\nI listed several reasons, including the federalist system,<br />\nthe weakness of the extremist parties, and a long tradition of government stability in the USA.<br />\nThe attempted coup caught me by surprise, but<br />\ncontemporary Spanish politics should have led me to<br />\nexpect drastic measures. Follwoing the 1939 victory of<br />\nthe Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, General<br />\nFrancisco Franco established his fascist reign in Spain.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nmembers of the neo-fascist political party Fuerza Nueva<br />\nparaded past my dormitory on their way to pay homage<br />\nto Franco's grave on the anniversary of his death.<br />\nIn spite of the chaos plaguing Madrid during the<br />\ncoup attempt, the Cortes somehow gathered together<br />\nand voted for Calvo Sotelo as president only a few days<br />\nafter the tragedy. To celebrate a triumph of the democracy, center and leftists parties organized a rally, which I<br />\natttended with my friends Ronco and Pablo. On a dark<br />\nFriday afternoon, one of the rare days when drizzle fell<br />\non the semi-desert Castilian region, we caught the bus<br />\ndowntown. There we encountered more people than I<br />\nhad ever seen before: Spaniards packing the streets,<br />\noverflowing on the wrought-iron balconies, and pressing<br />\nagainst the numerous fountains.<br />\nAfter hopping off the bus, I soon noticed that<br />\nthe hundreds of thousands of Spaniards present made<br />\nrelatively little noise. I later discovered that the leaders<br />\nhad organized the rally around the theme of the silent<br />\nmajority's support for the existing democracy. Hence,<br />\nthe participants carried no banners that espoused grandiose proclamations and\u2014at least in the beginning \u2014<br />\nchanted no slogans.<br />\nWhereas Ronco and Pablo soon became bored<br />\nand returned to the dormitory, I remained enthralled. I<br />\nhurried past the Prado, up to where the culmination of<br />\nactivities would be, directly in front of the Cortes. I<br />\nstationed myself in the small plaza in front of the<br />\nspeakers' podium, slightly uphill from the area a line of<br />\nmarchers would be coming from. Standing on my<br />\ntiptoes and being a head taller than the average Spaniard<br />\nhelped me catch a glimpse of the action down below.<br />\nAfter a few minutes, the vociferous Mediterraneans refused to remain a silent majority, and the<br />\ncheering began:<br />\n\"Viva el rey!\" shouted one man.<br />\n\"Viva!\" responded the crowd. Their echoes<br />\nreverberated off the elegant facades of the tall buildings.<br />\n\"Viva la democracia! Viva la lihertad! Viva el<br />\nrey!\"<br />\n\"Que vivan!\"<br />\nWhen the drizzle turned to rain, I left the rally<br />\nconvinced that the Spanish people would at least give<br />\ntheir form of government a chance to institute valuable<br />\nsocial reforms. Yet my faith began to diminish soon<br />\nafter the rally, when I learned that large cities such as<br />\nMadrid and Barcelona supported the democracy more<br />\nthan the provinces, that the massive rally in the streets<br />\nof Madrid was not necessarily a true indication of the<br />\nsentiments of the entire Spanish population. Also, a<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nEA<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThough not a Hitler, Franco was not exactly a pioneer in<br />\nsocial reform during his 36 years in power. Upon his<br />\ndeath in 1975, the country returned to the long lost<br />\nmonarchy, but this time qualified it with a constitution.<br />\nNonetheless, the Spanish Right continues to<br />\nbelieve that Franco was a benevolent and just ruler who<br />\nbrought the country stability and prosperity while<br />\nkeeping the Marxists away from disruptive actions.<br />\nThis great myth is supported by the country's current<br />\n_problems\u2014inflation, unemployment, rising crime rate,<br />\nunrest in the Basque region\u2014and the democracy's<br />\nweakness in dealing with them. I heard many American<br />\nstudents joke about the widows they boarded with who<br />\noften reminisced about the \"good old days:\" \"When<br />\nFranco was alive, we could walk alone on the streets at<br />\nnight. . .When Franco was alive, the prices were much<br />\nlower.. .\"<br />\nIn addition to these average citizens, fascist<br />\nyouth movements and scores of military officials constitute Spain's answer to the Moral Majority and are out to<br />\nprevent the people from acquiring such legal rights as<br />\ndivorce and abortion. The pressure from these groups<br />\nwas evident well before the attempted coup, as when<br /><br />\ncrisis developed over the contamination of the olive oil<br />\nsupplies so important to the Spanish diet. Hundreds of<br />\npeople died and the victims' families have since turned<br />\nto the government for help. The government feels a<br />\ngreat obligation and realizes that it must prove to the<br />\npeople that it can effectively handle such crises.<br />\nMost of all, the Basque terrorists(ETA)continue<br />\nto slaughter people in the name of their homeland<br />\nEuskadi, while members of the military continue to<br />\nretaliate by torturing ETA prisoners and reinforcing<br />\ntheir stronghold on Euslcadi. Jorge Semprun wrote in<br />\nL'Express of March 7, 1981, that the two extremes \"are<br />\nbound by the same blood pact. They both need the<br />\nresurgence of Francoism to help them legitimize their<br />\naction.\"<br /><br />\nTo win the faith of the Spanish people., the<br />\ndemocracy must wedge itself between the two extremes<br />\nand destroy the blood pact created out of the violence<br />\nof the country's past. It will be a difficult task, and time<br />\nis crucial: any mistake guarantees immediate reactions<br />\nfrom the extremist opposition.<br /><br />\nPAGE 16/ FEBRUARY ;12, 1982<br /><br />\nLou Reed's Blue Mask<br />\nBY GEORGE YATCHISIN<br /><br />\nThe Blue Mask ends as it begins: with<br />\nhope.

Reed has been around for \"European Son\").<br />\nReed sings (yes,<br />\nover fifteen years now, and next to David he actually sings through most of the<br />\nBowie, has probably gone through more album, habit-breaking as it might seem),<br />\nchanges than any rock figure. But no \"I've really got a lucky life/My writing,<br />\nmatter how the music has changed my motorcycle, my wife.\" His pleasures<br />\nthrough the years, at least since 1976's seem to be simple things, and the most<br />\nConey Island Baby he's been pushing one simple of these is love.

Musically it's of a trilogy of love. The first tune of the<br />\na Velvet Underground throwback circa group, \"Women,\" is lyrically as playful as<br />\nWhite Light, White Heat, complete with any Reed (i.e., Growing Up In Public),<br />\n\"messy\" production (not quite a sloppy but instead of trying to lay every female,<br />\nPhil Spector), guitar feedback and distor- he glorifies them. Women become the<br />\ntion, crashing drums and cymbals, and answer to all the maladies of the world as<br />\nabove all Reed's voice which shouts more laid down in \"Blue Mask.\" In \"Women\"<br />\nthan sings.

Arthur, an unpretentious excursion into the sort of loopy<br />\nhumor that the British, notably P.G.<br />\nWodehouse, specialize in, has all the<br />\ningredients for a classic movie comedy:<br />\nsuperb comic timing, character actors<br />\nwho vigorously chew the scenery,. and a<br />\nplot as soppy and convoluted as its hero is<br />\nsimply sodden. Poor little rich boy<br />\nArthur (Dudley Moore) can have everything his ill-gotten loot can buy\u2014and<br />\nwhat he primarily aims to be is the<br />\nworld's most alcoholic playboy. But<br />\nresponsibility lurks behind his wine cellar,<br />\nand by the movie's end, Arthur is prodded down the road to adulthood, learning<br />\nabout love, caring, and values\u2014but not<br />\nwithout first getting into reels of pratfalls<br />\nand problems.<br />\nPredicament number one: the<br />\nfamilial powers that be have decreed<br />\nArthur's imminent betrothal to the<br />\ninsipid but loaded Susan, who comes<br />\ncomplete with fortune, a mansion with<br />\nstuffed jungle animals, and a belligerent<br />\nfather who informs Arthur that he must<br />\nand will give up alcohol, much to his<br />\ndrunken chagrin.<br />\nPredicament number two: while<br />\nArthur is purchasing three dozen sweaters<br />\nat Bergdorf Goodman's to rebel against<br />\nthis match, he meets a would-be actress<br />\nfrom Queens (Liza Minnelli) who supports herself by shoplifting. Needless to<br />\nsay, he is entranced by this creature from<br />\nthe huddled masses and falls in love with<br />\nher, leading to:<br />\nPredicament number three: disinheritance looks Arthur right in his<br />\nbloodshot eyes if he fails to marry Susan.<br />\nProperly primed, he sloshes his way over<br />\nand dutifully proposes, with all the<br />\nenthusiasm of a three-day-old meatloaf.<br />\nInto all this chaos steps the<br />\ninvincible<br />\nand<br />\nincorrigible<br />\nSir<br />\nJohn Gielgud , the Jeeves of Arthur.

He charged<br /><br />\nthat many athletes received<br />\nexaminations with the answers<br />\nattached. He also revealed the<br />\nstory of one who was purposely<br />\nplaced into difficult courses so<br />\nhe would fail \"because the<br />\ncoaches didn't need him anymore.\" Not to be outdone by<br />\nUCLA's abortions, Florida State,<br />\naccording to Bozeman,once sent<br />\na cheerleader to \"help recruit\" a<br />\nhigh school athlete.<br />\nBozeman commented, \"I<br />\nhaven't touched a ball since I<br />\nleft the team.
