The point we would make<br />\nis, that almost anything may be accomplished by voluntary association<br />\nusually known in college circles as team-work.

It,<br />\nalso, recommends, among other things, that some particular phase of<br />\n<br />\nthe city's affairs be made the subject for detail work. The topic for 1905-1906 was \"The Relation of the City to the Gas and Electric Light Service,\" and that for 1906-1907 is \"The Relation of the Municipality to the Water Supply.\" This has received added interest from the<br />\nfact that the topic can be used as the subject of the competitive essays for the Baldwin Prize.<br />\nMany institutions are in sympathy with the movement, and eleven are now trying the<br />\nplan. Although Professor Willoughly says that he does not \"think it practicable to pledge<br />\nthe University to give a specific course,\" yet he will aid, we are sure, anyone who may feel<br />\ninterested in competing for the Baldwin prize, a notice of which will be found posted.<br />\n<br />\nvolvw,<br />\n<br />\nE can see but little advantage in the new system of marking.<br />\nThe black list looms up just as forbidding as before, while it<br />\nV<br />\n71if vErS<br />\n* \u2022<br />\n*.<br />\nV<br />\n* 4V<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\nS'. ill<br />\n<br />\n-4, *<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nThere doesn't seem to have been any valid reason for changing<br />\nfrom one to the other.

Not so many years<br />\n1: *<br />\n*\u2022<br />\n\u2022*<br />\nago it was thought so necessary to put a check on this practice that it<br />\n1* \u2022-i: was required that every complimentary ticket should bear the name of<br />\ns'\u2022A) *<br />\n7*<br />\n*<br />\nV<br />\n-i, *<br />\nthe person to whom the ticket was presented. An examination was then<br />\n\u2022 ********* \u2022<br />\nmade of the tickets and it was a significant fact that the number of comqY .4.,<br />\ntickets used fell off. The writer of this does not mean to<br />\nplimentary<br />\n....1--insinuate anything nor is he moved by jealousy because he did not have<br />\ntickets himself. He is able to say that he could have gone to most of the games on free<br />\ntickets this year and last and that to his knowledge a great many people did. In large colleges conditions are different, but with our athletic finances in serious straits, we are of the<br />\nopinion that this plan should be used.<br />\n\u2022 wab<br />\nNnevrilflovv .<br />\n<br />\naat,,: .,4;h<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nHE death, on January 5th, of Mr. Ormond Willson Hammond, Jr., who graduated last June from the undergraduate department of this University, came to all his<br />\nfellow-students, as well as to all those who had known him,<br />\nas one of the saddest happenings of the past twelve months.<br />\nMr. Hammond's record during his residence at the University,<br />\nboth as regards his class-work and association with student<br />\nactivities, was one to be envied. Always characterized by<br />\nhigh ideals and good fellowship, in thought and action, the<br />\nfuture seemed bright and full of promise for him. Although<br />\nhis broad-minded desire to mingle with his fellow-students<br />\nkept him from becoming a recluse, his devotion to duty was<br />\nmanifest in the high standing he maintained in his studies.<br />\nHis uprightness and frankness inspired confidence in all with<br />\nwhom he was thrown, and sincere indeed was the general<br />\ngrief at the time he was taken ill, six weeks ago.<br />\nDuring his stay at Hopkins, Mr. Hammond was connected actively with the editorial staff of the Nuws-LETTER,<br />\nconducting the magazine as editor-in-chief from the spring of<br />\n1905 to the fall of 1906. Under his direction the paper became<br />\na potent factor in the student life. He was Hopkins' correspondent for the Baltimore News and New York Evening Post,<br />\n1904-1906. At the commencement exercises last June he was<br />\nawarded the Tocqueville gold medal for the best essay written<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nlast year on french history,<br />\nThis past fall, Mr. Hammond entered the University of<br />\nMaryland Law School, from which he had expected to graduate<br />\nin two years. He was twenty-three years of age.<br />\nThe deepest sympathy is extended his family.<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTO MISS G.<br />\n<br />\nPARTING.<br />\n<br />\nJust below is a \"song,\" and I trust you will<br />\nfind<br />\n'T is the song of a lady just made to your<br />\nmind,<br />\nFor the words fit the lady, I'm sure you'll<br />\nagree<br />\nIf you've ever had the pleasure of knowing<br />\nMiss G.<br />\nHer \"rosy-red lips' are a charm to mankind,<br />\nAnd those \"curliest curls\" blow free in the<br />\nwind.<br />\nShe's called 'little Lady:\" 'pretty Miss G.,\"<br />\nBut she's \"sweetest of maidens\" to you and<br />\nto me.<br />\n<br />\n\"Since there's no helps come, let us kiss and part.\"<br />\n\u2014Drayton.<br />\n<br />\nIt is said that Dan Cupid has always been<br />\nblind,<br />\nHe was not at first, but the little god pined<br />\nFor a look on my lady, who made him, you see,<br />\nQuite blind, for Love's eyes are the eyes of<br />\nMiss G !<br />\n<br />\nTHE SONG.<br />\nI.<br />\nRosy-red lips, and honey-dew eyes,<br />\nTwo arching eye-brows, mockingly wise,<br />\nChin with a dimple, laughing and gay,<br />\nJoy of the moment\u2014aye, of the day!<br />\nSweetest of girls,<br />\nWith curliest curls,<br />\nJewel of all of them,<br />\nPearl among pearls!<br />\n<br />\nGay little smile and ripple of laughter,<br />\nGrave for a moment, joyous after,<br />\nAnd, (when they're needed.) the sweeteet of<br />\ntears;<br />\nJoy of the moment?

What was once<br />\na sleepy village, is now a busy manufacturing<br />\ntown where the hum of machinery is to be<br />\nheard everywhere, and where, by night, the<br />\nfitful glare of the blast furnaces is seen for<br />\nmiles around. The blackened hills are dotted<br />\nwith shafts, and their once verdant sides are<br />\ncriss-crossed by ore tracks. I well remember<br />\nwhen the first blast furnace was erected here<br />\ntwenty years ago, immediately after the discovery of great deposits of coal and iron.<br />\nThis was just before the dreadful occurrence<br />\nwhich horrified the valley.<br />\nOn the outskirts of the town, in the middle<br />\nof a little upland plain, stood an .old, weatherbeaten cottage where lived Mr. and Mrs.<br />\nKetchum, two elderly people whose wise<br />\nthough unworldly opinions were greatly respected thereabouts.<br />\nAs they were sitting under an old elm at<br />\nthe side of the house one summer evening, Joe<br />\nHarris, the village ne'er-do-well, came up the<br />\nroad and entered their yard. Joe was said to<br />\nbe a very bad fellow, but this reputation for<br />\nwickedness was apparently based on nothing<br />\nworse than his liking for strong drink and his<br />\nlove of solitude, Between his sprees he would<br />\ngo for long walks on the mountains, and because no one knew what he did at these times,<br />\n<br />\neveryone was certain that it was something<br />\nbad. His appearance was not prepossessing,<br />\nfor his walk resembled the stealthy movements<br />\nof an animal and his small beady eyes and<br />\never-twitching hands heightened the resemblance.<br />\nAs he turned in the gate, Carlo, Mr. Ketchums' huge mastiff, got up with a growl<br />\nthat changed to a bark of welcome when he<br />\nsaw who the visitor was. For this surly dog,<br />\nwho was feared by all the villagers, seemed to<br />\nhave a strange affection for Joe. People said<br />\nthat there was something akin in their natures.<br />\nBut, however it was, only Joe and the Ketchums' dared lay hands on the mastiff. \"Good<br />\nevening, Joe; come over and sit down,\" said<br />\nMr. Ketchum, genuinely sorry for the fellow,<br />\nwhom he considered never to have been given<br />\na chance. Joe's only reply was to come and<br />\nstand glowering in front of the two old<br />\npeople.<br />\n\"Mercy, what ails you, Joe?\" said Mrs.<br />\nKetchum, as she noticed his sullen countenance.<br />\n\"I'd like to teach you two meddlin' old<br />\nfools to min' yer own business,\" said he,<br />\nvenomously; \"what d' yer mean by makin'<br />\nmy girl throw me over?\"<br />\nOld Mr. Ketchum rose stiffly to his feet.<br />\n\"Joe Harris,\" said he, \"you are not good<br />\nenough for Mary Slater, and you know it.<br />\nAnd yet you dared to ask her to marry you.<br />\nOf course, we advised her to refuse you.<br />\nLeave my house and never come around<br />\nhere again, or you will find that my son<br />\nknows how to protect us from insults.\"<br />\nMrs. Ketchum clung to her husband aghast,<br />\nfor she had never before seen him aroused.<br />\n\"Don't John,\" she said, \"we must remember<br />\nthat perhaps he really loved Mary.\"<br />\n\"He shall never again say such words as<br />\nhe has in your presence,\" said Mr. Ketchum,<br />\nemphatically. \"Begone, sir!\"<br />\nMuttering what he dared not say, Joe<br />\nslouched away.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe sun has sinking slowly, and as it sank<br />\nit covered the hills with a golden glory while<br />\nthe mists of evening began to collect in the<br />\nvalleys. In the distance cow-bells were faintly heard. Slowly the glow on the tops of the<br />\nmountains disappeared and night descended.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nMrs. Ketchum rose and entered the house,<br />\nfollowed by her husband. The odor of cooking had long been perceptible, and the evening meal was ready when Mr. Ketchum had<br />\nscarcely done washing his hands in the tin<br />\nbasin by the well.<br />\nAs they rose from the table, when they<br />\nfinished their supper, the old man remarked,<br />\n\"What troubles you, Louisa, you have been<br />\nworried all during supper?\"<br />\n\"I have been thinking about what Joe said<br />\nthis afternoon. He might do us harm for I<br />\nbelieve he is half crazy,\" answered Mrs. Ketchum.<br />\nThe old man laughed as he said, \"Why,<br />\nmy dear, the threats of that worthless fellow<br />\nare not worth giving a second thought to.<br />\nI thought that there was some good in him,<br />\nbut I am beginning to believe that I was mistaken. Don't worry, anyway, for you know<br />\nTom will be home to-morrow.\"<br />\nIn the country they retire early, and so<br />\nsoon as the chores were done, the two old<br />\npeople and the hired girl went to their rooms<br />\nand were soon asleep. The dog took his<br />\naccustomed place on the doorstep.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAs the clocks were marking the hour of<br />\neleven, a figure stole into the Ketchums' yard.<br />\nIt crept softly up to the door where the dog<br />\nwas sleeping. \"Carlo!\" said a low voice.<br />\nThe dog started up and would have seized<br />\nthe intruder had not Joe (for it was he) raised<br />\nan admonishing hand. As the dog fawned on<br />\nhim, he drew a piece of meat from his pocket<br />\nand patting the animal, he gave it to him.<br />\n\"If that doesn't fix you, what I learned when<br />\nI was janitor in that laboratory in the city was<br />\nnot true,\" said he. \"In about two shakes<br />\nyou will go to sleep and never wake up.\" He<br />\nwas right, for presently as he stood watching<br />\nthe dog, the powerful poison that he had given<br />\nCarlo began to have an effect. The animal<br />\nwas soon seized with convulsions, and in one<br />\nof them he died.<br />\nAs soon as Joe saw that the dog was dead,<br />\nhe turned towards the wood-house, from<br />\nwhich he took a heavy axe that was used to<br />\nchop kindlings. Then he crept over to the<br />\nkitchen window and raised it, and in a<br />\nmoment he was in the house. Slowly he<br />\ncrept up the stairs, pausing at each step to<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nassure himself that the regular breathing of<br />\nthe sleepers was undisturbed. Now he<br />\nreached the door. Across the floor he glided<br />\nuntil he stood poising the axe, at the bedside.<br />\nMrs. Ketchum turned in her sleep and for a<br />\nmoment Joe's heart beat suffocatingly. Is he<br />\ndetected? No, for all is again silent. A dog's<br />\nbark can be heard in the distance but that is<br />\nall. As he stood there, he gnashed his teeth<br />\nin maniacal fury. Then he struck once\u2014and<br />\nwhat was a human being is lifeless clay! The<br />\ndying cry of his wife awoke Mr. Ketchum<br />\nand his eyes opened to see the dreadful picture of the murderer with his blood-besmeard<br />\naxe standing in the moonlight. As the old<br />\nman screamed, \"Help!\" the assailant struck<br />\nagain. The old man threw up his arm and as<br />\na result was not killed but horribly injured.<br />\nDespite his wound, Mr. Ketchum sprang up<br />\nand grappled with the assassin in an endeavor<br />\nto wrest the axe away, but he was an old<br />\nman and no match for Joe. A blow from the<br />\nhelve sent him staggering, and ere he could<br />\nclosed in again the axe was buried in his<br />\nbrain and he fell with a deep groan. But his<br />\ncries had aroused the 'girl upstairs, and suddenly her screams of \"Help! murder!\" rang<br />\nout. Up the stairs dashed the fiend with his<br />\nbloody axe. Her door was -locked. He<br />\nrained blows upon it, but she piled the furniture against it and redoubled her cries. In<br />\nthe distance a faint \"Halloa\" was heard, and<br />\nJoe realized that he must run for his life\u2014the<br />\ngame was up! He dashed down the stairs,<br />\nunlocked the door, dropped the fatal axe<br />\nbeside the body of the dead dog and dashed<br />\nacross the fields for the woods.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAs the men from the village who had been<br />\naroused by the dreadful cries come running<br />\nup the road, they saw Joe dash into the woods.<br />\nWith them was Tom Ketchum, who had<br />\narrived in town unexpectedly. He seemed to<br />\nhave a presentiment of the tragedy, for he<br />\noutstripped his companions and bounded past<br />\nthe body of the dog, and the axe nearby, into<br />\n\u2022the house. When the men arrived a moment<br />\nor two later and rushed upstairs, they found<br />\na man apparently turned to stone, for Tom<br />\nstood motionless gazing at the mutilated<br />\nbodies. As they entered the room, he slowly<br />\nturned and they shrank back from what they<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nsaw in his eyes. Without a word he walked<br />\ndown the stairs. The rest followed him, for<br />\nthat room was a sight that returned to many<br />\nafterwards in their dreams. When he reached<br />\nthe door and saw the murderer's trail, \"Get<br />\ndogs,\" said he, \"and follow him.\" Then he<br />\npicked up the axe and started to follow the<br />\nfootsteps of the running Joe, who could be<br />\nseen far down the moonlit road leading to the<br />\ntown.<br />\nAfter the fugitive streamed the pursuers.<br />\nI am accounted a good runner, but never have<br />\nI seen a man run as Tom Ketchum ran that<br />\nnight, for he drew away from me even as I<br />\ndrew away from the crowd of farmers. Joe<br />\nlooked around, saw us coming, and ran still<br />\nmore frantically. But the Nemesis continued<br />\nto close the gap between the two. Now the<br />\ntown was reached. Directly ahead was the<br />\nblast furnace with its endless chain of buckets<br />\ncarrying up ore. The furnaces were operated<br />\nboth night and day, and so even at this hour<br />\nthe machinery was moving. Tom was almost<br />\nupon the murderer, and the axe would in a<br />\nmoment more have again reeked with blood,<br />\nbut to escape, Joe seized one of the buckets as<br />\nit went by him. Immediately he was whisked<br />\noff the ground, but now he realized what he<br />\nhad done. He must die! If he jumped<br />\nTom was waiting below. If he remained<br />\nwhere he was, in a few seconds he would be<br />\ndirectly over the lake of molten metal. He<br />\nrose higher and higher. As he neared the<br />\ntop of the chain of buckets, he raved and<br />\nlaughed\u2014the laugh of a maniac. Just then<br />\nhe reached the top. The bucket turned. He<br />\ndisappeared through the feed-door to meet a<br />\ndeath more horrible than pen can describe!<br />\n<br />\nTHE MASS MEETING.<br />\nYou all know what happened at the mass<br />\nmeeting held on Friday, January 5, 1907; so<br />\nbut a very brief summary of the business<br />\ntransacted need be given. The idea of the<br />\nmeeting was to discuss baseball, and surely<br />\nthat end was reached. The whole baseball<br />\nquestion was thrashed out, and definite action<br />\nwas taken.<br />\nPresident Plaggemeyer stated the position<br />\nof the Board of Governors in not recognizing<br />\n<br />\na baseball team. Then many of those interested in the matter arose and talked, sometimes on the subject, and again off. At last,<br />\nto the satisfaction of all present, a plan to<br />\nraise money by subscription was adopted.<br />\nThe general understanding was, that a team<br />\nwould be put on the field, provided the money<br />\nwere forthcoming. A committee was then<br />\nappointed to raise the money. Thus the question was definitely settled.<br />\nThe Board of Governors of the Athletic<br />\nAssociation met on the following Monday,<br />\nand elected Mr. John A Crane temporary<br />\nmanager of baseball, pending the recognition<br />\nof the sport. Until the committee should<br />\nmake a report, they could not recognize baseball. Probably before this is in print, the<br />\nsport will have been recognized.<br />\nNow let us bury the hatchet, and wash<br />\naway all war-paint. The misunderstanding<br />\nhas been cleared up, and Hopkins is hoping<br />\nfor a prosperous year in baseball. We feel<br />\nsure that baseball will receive as enthusiastic<br />\nsupport as the other teams. It only remains<br />\nfor the men to come out and work for the<br />\nteam. The captain has not yet been elected,<br />\nbut will probably be at the first meeting of<br />\nthe candidates. Get together and lick Virginia and St. John's this year, and bring fresh<br />\nlaurels to the Black and Blue.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nThe Freshman Class-pin has made its appearance. It is of rather attractive design, if<br />\nany class-pins may be said to be attractive.<br />\nWe note that the Freshmen seem to have<br />\nThe word<br />\nadopted Simplified Spelling.<br />\n\"University\" is spelled with a \"C\" instead<br />\nof an \"S.\" However they did not commit<br />\nthe error of having \"John Hopkins.\"<br />\nAlas and alack! The slot machine has been<br />\nrepaired! For about two weeks before the<br />\nXmas holidays, the slot machine in the basement was suffering from an extraordinary<br />\nailment. You could put in a cent and by a<br />\nlittle delicate maneuvering with the fingers,<br />\nyou would get, not only a piece of chocolate,<br />\nbut would even get back your cent, and some-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ntimes with interest. In this way, one cent<br />\ncould be used to get as many as five or six<br />\npieces of chocolate. Naturally, it didn't take<br />\nlong for this condition of affairs to become<br />\nknown. Then unfortunately, the game was<br />\nqueered in some way, and now you no longer<br />\nget your money back. In some way, Christhilf got wise.<br />\n\"Easter's next.\"<br />\n<br />\nLEVERING HALL.<br />\nAt a student meeting on January 9, Professor Palmer, of St. John's University in<br />\nShanghai, China, and Mr. Frank Slack, Traveling Secretary in the Eastern Colleges,<br />\nmade addresses on the opportunities open to<br />\nstudents in the important activities of modern<br />\nmissions.<br />\nProfessor Palmer told of the marvelous<br />\nawakening of a desire among the Chinese<br />\nfor western learning. This is evidenced in<br />\nthe fact that there are now nearly 15,000<br />\nChinese students in Japan, where they get<br />\nmodern institution more cheaply than they<br />\ncould by coming to America. The great need<br />\nfor Christian teachers in China should attract<br />\nmen of ability, who can inspire and direct the<br />\nlatent energy of China's men.<br />\nMr. Slack emphasized the necessity for the<br />\ncollege student to be informed on the lines of<br />\npresent missionary work. The interest<br />\nattaching to the study of missions is unsurpassed by that of any other study. In it we<br />\nget world-politics, geography, biography,<br />\nmodern history, adventure, romance; and<br />\nabove all the needs and opportunities of the<br />\nwork are impressed upon us.<br />\n<br />\nTwo classes for such study will be begun<br />\nthis month. One, led by Dr. Barret, will<br />\nstudy Dr. Grose's book, \"Aliens or Americans?\" This book treats the great immigration problem. The other class will study<br />\nforeign missions, using Mr. Mott's book,<br />\n\"The Evangelization of the World in This<br />\nGeneration.\" These classes are open to all<br />\nHopkins men. They will meet at times suitable to the members.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nTHE TRIALS OF AN EDITOR.<br />\nIn the first place it should be well understood, with few exceptions, that some of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER B o ard write the NEWSLETTER. The thing is done two hours or<br />\nless from the time the yellow rag goes to<br />\npress. We are forced to admit that this year<br />\none freshman did hand in sixteen ardent,<br />\nburning and melancholy verses at one time.<br />\n(Padding.) Also that there appears in this<br />\nissue a story also written by a member of the<br />\nfreshmen class which was accompanied by the<br />\nusual statement that \"it is based on facts!\"<br />\nAlso, \"If you will publish this in the NEWSLETTER, I will feel well repaid for my labors.\"<br />\nHe is well repaid. Then, too, we are in<br />\npossession of the following which is copied<br />\nverbatim.<br />\n\"DEAR C. : I just ran across the enclosed<br />\nwhich I wrote when I had a stomach ache this<br />\nsummer. Perhaps you can use it in the<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER.<br />\nVery truly,<br />\nF.\"<br />\nWhen the proof comes up it is usually<br />\n\"short,\" that is the Editor must fill up the<br />\nspace\u2014that is what the Editor is doing now.<br />\nThe University has not half so many sins<br />\nas would appear from the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nBut\u2014we must fill up the space or else write<br />\nlove sick poetry. We feel it much better to<br />\nwrite complaints to the students of the college than to the fair sex. If, by any chance,<br />\nsome freshman has written lovelorn verses to<br />\nsome girl of his acquaintance, upon its publication there is sure to appear an upper classman<br />\nwho objects that the editor has been making<br />\nfun of his lady love. (We are prepared to<br />\ngive facts.)<br />\nDid you ever study permutations and combinations ? I didn't, but they are really<br />\nnecessary to compute the number of corrections in the proof.<br />\nNow, Gentle Reader, this is our confession,<br />\nand although it is not entirely true, at least it<br />\nfills up space.<br />\n<br />\n.--0<br />\nOH, REGGY!<br />\nPercy\u2014Have you seen Grace George in<br />\n'Clothes?'<br />\nReggy\u2014Of course\u2014she's not in a comic<br />\nopera.\u2014Ex.<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS UNDER-GRADUATE<br />\nCLUB.<br />\nWe can remember in looking over the files<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTERS and Hullabalos the<br />\nfutile attempts to form Senior Societies and<br />\nUnder-graduate Clubs. They always failed.<br />\nPerhaps they will always fail. The reason<br />\nthey failed is because no one has realized that<br />\nthere has been since the University started a<br />\nreal Undergraduate Club.<br />\nThe building is low and rakish, lingering<br />\nalong almost a block. It has a yellow weather<br />\nstained coat of paint and a pair of enormous<br />\niron lamps, heavy unto top heaviness. It was<br />\nonce a tavern on the Reisterstown Road before<br />\nthe houses in the neighborhood were built.<br />\nStroll in some night, entering a narrow<br />\npassage and dropping to your left down a little<br />\nflight of stairs. At nine o'clock the little<br />\ntables are empty, a drowsy negro waiter has<br />\nfallen asleep over his newspaper. Come in at<br />\nten, and there are five people in the place,<br />\neleven and the whole place is alert. The<br />\nwaiter is staggering under well laden trays,<br />\noysters, beer, highballs. At the tables yon<br />\nwill see club men in dress clothes, a group of<br />\nautomobilists warming up after a run into the<br />\nnight, two or three graduate students discussing organic chemistry and the faculty of this<br />\nand other universities. But in the back room<br />\nyou will usually find a party of undergraduates<br />\nalways at the same table, if possible, who<br />\ndiscuss the sins and shortcomings of their<br />\nelders in a pertinent and impertinent way, the<br />\natheletic outlook, the best way of passing<br />\nexaminations. A waste of time, say thou?<br />\nNo. I have heard William Blake and Dante<br />\nGabriel Rossetti discussed in sane and dispassionate language by boys who had failed<br />\nin English and the man who knew most<br />\nintimately the Roland Chanson was flunked<br />\nin French. And the remarkable part of it<br />\nwas that it was not put on for the benefit of<br />\nthose who might hear.<br />\nThere are, of course, certain habituees of<br />\nthe place. I hear that before my time there<br />\nwas a certain man called \"Mr. Pipp\" who<br />\nregularly went to sleep over his table. Then,<br />\nthere is \"Napoleon Bonaparte,\" who was<br />\ntaken out and put in a cab without any money<br />\nand sent to some impossible address.<br />\n<br />\nIf the round faced proprietor of the place<br />\ntakes a fancy to you and you make friends<br />\nwith his two cheerful helpers, not to mention<br />\nJoe and Sam, you can rest assured that your<br />\ncredit is good. It is good to drop in at<br />\nChristmas. And if you graduate and come<br />\nback looking up your old haunts, it may be<br />\nthat even Walter will have forgotten you at<br />\nthe University, your friends scattered to the<br />\nfour winds, but\u2014Joe and Sam will bound to<br />\naid you with your coat, and swear that they<br />\nknow you.<br />\nBe you a wise or foolish virgin, with your<br />\nlamp lit or not, you will find the door open\u2014<br />\nit has not been locked for eight years. They<br />\nhave lost the key.<br />\n<br />\nJACKSON'S METHOD.<br />\n(A Study in Success.)<br />\n<br />\nMontgomery Jackson was said by all to be<br />\na failure; he never would amount to any thing.<br />\nHe did get his degree on this side, it is true,<br />\nbut he was not expected to last two months<br />\nwhen he entered the medical school. Then<br />\nhe reformed.<br />\nNobody believed it, however, and his previous reputation preceded him to no great<br />\nadvantage on his part. But he worked and<br />\nworked. They did not throw him out.<br />\nI am not conversant with the technical<br />\nlanguage needed to make this history convincing, but here are the facts and the truth.<br />\nThe study of the venation of the embryo<br />\nwas at that time usually done (I am told) by<br />\nresolving a young pig into its lowest terms<br />\nwith a knife and several other necessary imimplements, Montgomery spoiled three pigs;<br />\nthen, growing impatient he dumped the<br />\nsupply of pigs into a pan in his locker and<br />\nwent to New York to see several new musical<br />\nshows and a certain young lady. The young<br />\nlady refused to marry him, because he had<br />\nshown no ability in his profession, and Montgomery came back determined to do or<br />\nNow, Montgomery was a very careless<br />\nyoung man, and his locker was most untidy.<br />\nThe pan in the locker was filled with the accumulation .of months of dumpings,chemicals,<br />\nantiseptics, foreign matter and six young pigs.<br />\nHe remembered as he read an article in a<br />\nGerman medical journal the attempts of the<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nprofession to render the embryos transparent.<br />\nHe smiled on the train as he thought of the<br />\nsix pigs in the pan, and to amuse himself<br />\nmade books on the rotting condition he would<br />\nfind them in. He wrote a parody on the \"six<br />\nlittle pigs went to market.\"<br />\nThen he forgot the matter. One day he<br />\nopened the locker. No stench. Six little pigs<br />\nlying calm and gelatine like. He picked up<br />\none after another. All perfectly transparent.<br />\nThe venation and muscles quite visible.<br />\n\"Jackson's Method\" appeared, bearing the<br />\nseal of the University. I believe he got favorable mention in Europe. The Medical School<br />\nwis honored by his presence. Montgomery<br />\ntook pains to analyze the mess in the bottom<br />\nof the pan and the formula is now in common<br />\nuse. They say that Jackson is a genius.<br />\nPerhaps. But I think he will marry the girl.<br />\n<br />\nALUMNI NOTES.<br />\nThe Review of Reviews is very intimately<br />\nconnected with this University.

Everybody has shown that he has the interest of the team at<br />\nheart by freely giving what money he had. The point we would make<br />\nis, that almost anything may be accomplished by voluntary association<br />\nusually known in college circles as team-work. There is no longer any<br />\nsee such spirit.<br /><br />\nfear that any worthy sport or institution is going to the wall while we<br />\nNow that we have gotten together, let us stay together!<br /><br />\nE would call the attention of our readers to the Hopkins Night<br />\nto be held on February 4, 1907, at Ford's Theatre. \"Strongheart\" is the play\u2014a college play and it is said well done.<br />\nIt really won't make any difference whether it is any good or<br />\nnot. You will have just as good a time. The proceeds, if any<br />\nare to be for the Hullaballo. After the terrible time which<br />\nlast years Hullaballo had with its business affairs it is to be<br />\nhoped that everybody will help it this year and have a good<br />\ntime at the Hopkins Night.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n44. \u2022 .q.e1A:<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nE have recently received a communication from the National Munici-<br /><br />\n00 0<br /><br />\n00<br />\n\u2022 ris ruitbilx<br /><br />\npal League, of which Mr. Bonaparte is president, calling our attention to their efforts towards a \"co-ordination of university and collegiate instruction in municipal government.\" It seems that the<br />\nLeague wishes to arouse the interest of the students in the problems<br />\nof city administration, and is putting forth an effort to get the<br /><br />\n1<br />\naaioirazislais<br />\nu1<br /><br />\nuniversities to give a course dealing wholly with this question. It,<br />\nalso, recommends, among other things, that some particular phase of<br /><br />\nthe city's affairs be made the subject for detail work. The topic for 1905-1906 was \"The Relation of the City to the Gas and Electric Light Service,\" and that for 1906-1907 is \"The Relation of the Municipality to the Water Supply.\" This has received added interest from the<br />\nfact that the topic can be used as the subject of the competitive essays for the Baldwin Prize.<br />\nMany institutions are in sympathy with the movement, and eleven are now trying the<br />\nplan. Although Professor Willoughly says that he does not \"think it practicable to pledge<br />\nthe University to give a specific course,\" yet he will aid, we are sure, anyone who may feel<br />\ninterested in competing for the Baldwin prize, a notice of which will be found posted.<br /><br />\nvolvw,<br /><br />\nE can see but little advantage in the new system of marking.<br />\nThe black list looms up just as forbidding as before, while it<br />\nV<br />\n71if vErS<br />\n* \u2022<br />\n*.<br />\nV<br />\n* 4V<br /><br />\nV<br />\nS'. ill<br /><br />\n-4, *<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nThere doesn't seem to have been any valid reason for changing<br />\nfrom one to the other.

Not so many years<br />\n1: *<br />\n*\u2022<br />\n\u2022*<br />\nago it was thought so necessary to put a check on this practice that it<br />\n1* \u2022-i: was required that every complimentary ticket should bear the name of<br />\ns'\u2022A) *<br />\n7*<br />\n*<br />\nV<br />\n-i, *<br />\nthe person to whom the ticket was presented. An examination was then<br />\n\u2022 ********* \u2022<br />\nmade of the tickets and it was a significant fact that the number of comqY .4.,<br />\ntickets used fell off. The writer of this does not mean to<br />\nplimentary<br />\n....1--insinuate anything nor is he moved by jealousy because he did not have<br />\ntickets himself. He is able to say that he could have gone to most of the games on free<br />\ntickets this year and last and that to his knowledge a great many people did. In large colleges conditions are different, but with our athletic finances in serious straits, we are of the<br />\nopinion that this plan should be used.<br />\n\u2022 wab<br />\nNnevrilflovv .<br /><br />\naat,,: .,4;h<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nHE death, on January 5th, of Mr. Ormond Willson Hammond, Jr., who graduated last June from the undergraduate department of this University, came to all his<br />\nfellow-students, as well as to all those who had known him,<br />\nas one of the saddest happenings of the past twelve months.<br />\nMr. Hammond's record during his residence at the University,<br />\nboth as regards his class-work and association with student<br />\nactivities, was one to be envied. Always characterized by<br />\nhigh ideals and good fellowship, in thought and action, the<br />\nfuture seemed bright and full of promise for him. Although<br />\nhis broad-minded desire to mingle with his fellow-students<br />\nkept him from becoming a recluse, his devotion to duty was<br />\nmanifest in the high standing he maintained in his studies.<br />\nHis uprightness and frankness inspired confidence in all with<br />\nwhom he was thrown, and sincere indeed was the general<br />\ngrief at the time he was taken ill, six weeks ago.<br />\nDuring his stay at Hopkins, Mr. Hammond was connected actively with the editorial staff of the Nuws-LETTER,<br />\nconducting the magazine as editor-in-chief from the spring of<br />\n1905 to the fall of 1906. Under his direction the paper became<br />\na potent factor in the student life. He was Hopkins' correspondent for the Baltimore News and New York Evening Post,<br />\n1904-1906. At the commencement exercises last June he was<br />\nawarded the Tocqueville gold medal for the best essay written<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nlast year on french history,<br />\nThis past fall, Mr. Hammond entered the University of<br />\nMaryland Law School, from which he had expected to graduate<br />\nin two years. He was twenty-three years of age.<br />\nThe deepest sympathy is extended his family.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTO MISS G.<br /><br />\nPARTING.<br /><br />\nJust below is a \"song,\" and I trust you will<br />\nfind<br />\n'T is the song of a lady just made to your<br />\nmind,<br />\nFor the words fit the lady, I'm sure you'll<br />\nagree<br />\nIf you've ever had the pleasure of knowing<br />\nMiss G.<br />\nHer \"rosy-red lips' are a charm to mankind,<br />\nAnd those \"curliest curls\" blow free in the<br />\nwind.<br />\nShe's called 'little Lady:\" 'pretty Miss G.,\"<br />\nBut she's \"sweetest of maidens\" to you and<br />\nto me.<br /><br />\n\"Since there's no helps come, let us kiss and part.\"<br />\n\u2014Drayton.<br /><br />\nIt is said that Dan Cupid has always been<br />\nblind,<br />\nHe was not at first, but the little god pined<br />\nFor a look on my lady, who made him, you see,<br />\nQuite blind, for Love's eyes are the eyes of<br />\nMiss G !<br /><br />\nTHE SONG.<br />\nI.<br />\nRosy-red lips, and honey-dew eyes,<br />\nTwo arching eye-brows, mockingly wise,<br />\nChin with a dimple, laughing and gay,<br />\nJoy of the moment\u2014aye, of the day!<br />\nSweetest of girls,<br />\nWith curliest curls,<br />\nJewel of all of them,<br />\nPearl among pearls!<br /><br />\nGay little smile and ripple of laughter,<br />\nGrave for a moment, joyous after,<br />\nAnd, (when they're needed.) the sweeteet of<br />\ntears;<br />\nJoy of the moment?

What was once<br />\na sleepy village, is now a busy manufacturing<br />\ntown where the hum of machinery is to be<br />\nheard everywhere, and where, by night, the<br />\nfitful glare of the blast furnaces is seen for<br />\nmiles around. The blackened hills are dotted<br />\nwith shafts, and their once verdant sides are<br />\ncriss-crossed by ore tracks. I well remember<br />\nwhen the first blast furnace was erected here<br />\ntwenty years ago, immediately after the discovery of great deposits of coal and iron.<br />\nThis was just before the dreadful occurrence<br />\nwhich horrified the valley.<br />\nOn the outskirts of the town, in the middle<br />\nof a little upland plain, stood an .old, weatherbeaten cottage where lived Mr. and Mrs.<br />\nKetchum, two elderly people whose wise<br />\nthough unworldly opinions were greatly respected thereabouts.<br />\nAs they were sitting under an old elm at<br />\nthe side of the house one summer evening, Joe<br />\nHarris, the village ne'er-do-well, came up the<br />\nroad and entered their yard. Joe was said to<br />\nbe a very bad fellow, but this reputation for<br />\nwickedness was apparently based on nothing<br />\nworse than his liking for strong drink and his<br />\nlove of solitude, Between his sprees he would<br />\ngo for long walks on the mountains, and because no one knew what he did at these times,<br /><br />\neveryone was certain that it was something<br />\nbad. His appearance was not prepossessing,<br />\nfor his walk resembled the stealthy movements<br />\nof an animal and his small beady eyes and<br />\never-twitching hands heightened the resemblance.<br />\nAs he turned in the gate, Carlo, Mr. Ketchums' huge mastiff, got up with a growl<br />\nthat changed to a bark of welcome when he<br />\nsaw who the visitor was. For this surly dog,<br />\nwho was feared by all the villagers, seemed to<br />\nhave a strange affection for Joe. People said<br />\nthat there was something akin in their natures.<br />\nBut, however it was, only Joe and the Ketchums' dared lay hands on the mastiff. \"Good<br />\nevening, Joe; come over and sit down,\" said<br />\nMr. Ketchum, genuinely sorry for the fellow,<br />\nwhom he considered never to have been given<br />\na chance. Joe's only reply was to come and<br />\nstand glowering in front of the two old<br />\npeople.<br />\n\"Mercy, what ails you, Joe?\" said Mrs.<br />\nKetchum, as she noticed his sullen countenance.<br />\n\"I'd like to teach you two meddlin' old<br />\nfools to min' yer own business,\" said he,<br />\nvenomously; \"what d' yer mean by makin'<br />\nmy girl throw me over?\"<br />\nOld Mr. Ketchum rose stiffly to his feet.<br />\n\"Joe Harris,\" said he, \"you are not good<br />\nenough for Mary Slater, and you know it.<br />\nAnd yet you dared to ask her to marry you.<br />\nOf course, we advised her to refuse you.<br />\nLeave my house and never come around<br />\nhere again, or you will find that my son<br />\nknows how to protect us from insults.\"<br />\nMrs. Ketchum clung to her husband aghast,<br />\nfor she had never before seen him aroused.<br />\n\"Don't John,\" she said, \"we must remember<br />\nthat perhaps he really loved Mary.\"<br />\n\"He shall never again say such words as<br />\nhe has in your presence,\" said Mr. Ketchum,<br />\nemphatically. \"Begone, sir!\"<br />\nMuttering what he dared not say, Joe<br />\nslouched away.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe sun has sinking slowly, and as it sank<br />\nit covered the hills with a golden glory while<br />\nthe mists of evening began to collect in the<br />\nvalleys. In the distance cow-bells were faintly heard. Slowly the glow on the tops of the<br />\nmountains disappeared and night descended.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nMrs. Ketchum rose and entered the house,<br />\nfollowed by her husband. The odor of cooking had long been perceptible, and the evening meal was ready when Mr. Ketchum had<br />\nscarcely done washing his hands in the tin<br />\nbasin by the well.<br />\nAs they rose from the table, when they<br />\nfinished their supper, the old man remarked,<br />\n\"What troubles you, Louisa, you have been<br />\nworried all during supper?\"<br />\n\"I have been thinking about what Joe said<br />\nthis afternoon. He might do us harm for I<br />\nbelieve he is half crazy,\" answered Mrs. Ketchum.<br />\nThe old man laughed as he said, \"Why,<br />\nmy dear, the threats of that worthless fellow<br />\nare not worth giving a second thought to.<br />\nI thought that there was some good in him,<br />\nbut I am beginning to believe that I was mistaken. Don't worry, anyway, for you know<br />\nTom will be home to-morrow.\"<br />\nIn the country they retire early, and so<br />\nsoon as the chores were done, the two old<br />\npeople and the hired girl went to their rooms<br />\nand were soon asleep. The dog took his<br />\naccustomed place on the doorstep.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAs the clocks were marking the hour of<br />\neleven, a figure stole into the Ketchums' yard.<br />\nIt crept softly up to the door where the dog<br />\nwas sleeping. \"Carlo!\" said a low voice.<br />\nThe dog started up and would have seized<br />\nthe intruder had not Joe (for it was he) raised<br />\nan admonishing hand. As the dog fawned on<br />\nhim, he drew a piece of meat from his pocket<br />\nand patting the animal, he gave it to him.<br />\n\"If that doesn't fix you, what I learned when<br />\nI was janitor in that laboratory in the city was<br />\nnot true,\" said he. \"In about two shakes<br />\nyou will go to sleep and never wake up.\" He<br />\nwas right, for presently as he stood watching<br />\nthe dog, the powerful poison that he had given<br />\nCarlo began to have an effect. The animal<br />\nwas soon seized with convulsions, and in one<br />\nof them he died.<br />\nAs soon as Joe saw that the dog was dead,<br />\nhe turned towards the wood-house, from<br />\nwhich he took a heavy axe that was used to<br />\nchop kindlings. Then he crept over to the<br />\nkitchen window and raised it, and in a<br />\nmoment he was in the house. Slowly he<br />\ncrept up the stairs, pausing at each step to<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nassure himself that the regular breathing of<br />\nthe sleepers was undisturbed. Now he<br />\nreached the door. Across the floor he glided<br />\nuntil he stood poising the axe, at the bedside.<br />\nMrs. Ketchum turned in her sleep and for a<br />\nmoment Joe's heart beat suffocatingly. Is he<br />\ndetected? No, for all is again silent. A dog's<br />\nbark can be heard in the distance but that is<br />\nall. As he stood there, he gnashed his teeth<br />\nin maniacal fury. Then he struck once\u2014and<br />\nwhat was a human being is lifeless clay! The<br />\ndying cry of his wife awoke Mr. Ketchum<br />\nand his eyes opened to see the dreadful picture of the murderer with his blood-besmeard<br />\naxe standing in the moonlight. As the old<br />\nman screamed, \"Help!\" the assailant struck<br />\nagain. The old man threw up his arm and as<br />\na result was not killed but horribly injured.<br />\nDespite his wound, Mr. Ketchum sprang up<br />\nand grappled with the assassin in an endeavor<br />\nto wrest the axe away, but he was an old<br />\nman and no match for Joe. A blow from the<br />\nhelve sent him staggering, and ere he could<br />\nclosed in again the axe was buried in his<br />\nbrain and he fell with a deep groan. But his<br />\ncries had aroused the 'girl upstairs, and suddenly her screams of \"Help! murder!\" rang<br />\nout. Up the stairs dashed the fiend with his<br />\nbloody axe. Her door was -locked. He<br />\nrained blows upon it, but she piled the furniture against it and redoubled her cries. In<br />\nthe distance a faint \"Halloa\" was heard, and<br />\nJoe realized that he must run for his life\u2014the<br />\ngame was up! He dashed down the stairs,<br />\nunlocked the door, dropped the fatal axe<br />\nbeside the body of the dead dog and dashed<br />\nacross the fields for the woods.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAs the men from the village who had been<br />\naroused by the dreadful cries come running<br />\nup the road, they saw Joe dash into the woods.<br />\nWith them was Tom Ketchum, who had<br />\narrived in town unexpectedly. He seemed to<br />\nhave a presentiment of the tragedy, for he<br />\noutstripped his companions and bounded past<br />\nthe body of the dog, and the axe nearby, into<br />\n\u2022the house. When the men arrived a moment<br />\nor two later and rushed upstairs, they found<br />\na man apparently turned to stone, for Tom<br />\nstood motionless gazing at the mutilated<br />\nbodies. As they entered the room, he slowly<br />\nturned and they shrank back from what they<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nsaw in his eyes. Without a word he walked<br />\ndown the stairs. The rest followed him, for<br />\nthat room was a sight that returned to many<br />\nafterwards in their dreams. When he reached<br />\nthe door and saw the murderer's trail, \"Get<br />\ndogs,\" said he, \"and follow him.\" Then he<br />\npicked up the axe and started to follow the<br />\nfootsteps of the running Joe, who could be<br />\nseen far down the moonlit road leading to the<br />\ntown.<br />\nAfter the fugitive streamed the pursuers.<br />\nI am accounted a good runner, but never have<br />\nI seen a man run as Tom Ketchum ran that<br />\nnight, for he drew away from me even as I<br />\ndrew away from the crowd of farmers. Joe<br />\nlooked around, saw us coming, and ran still<br />\nmore frantically. But the Nemesis continued<br />\nto close the gap between the two. Now the<br />\ntown was reached. Directly ahead was the<br />\nblast furnace with its endless chain of buckets<br />\ncarrying up ore. The furnaces were operated<br />\nboth night and day, and so even at this hour<br />\nthe machinery was moving. Tom was almost<br />\nupon the murderer, and the axe would in a<br />\nmoment more have again reeked with blood,<br />\nbut to escape, Joe seized one of the buckets as<br />\nit went by him. Immediately he was whisked<br />\noff the ground, but now he realized what he<br />\nhad done. He must die! If he jumped<br />\nTom was waiting below. If he remained<br />\nwhere he was, in a few seconds he would be<br />\ndirectly over the lake of molten metal. He<br />\nrose higher and higher. As he neared the<br />\ntop of the chain of buckets, he raved and<br />\nlaughed\u2014the laugh of a maniac. Just then<br />\nhe reached the top. The bucket turned. He<br />\ndisappeared through the feed-door to meet a<br />\ndeath more horrible than pen can describe!<br /><br />\nTHE MASS MEETING.<br />\nYou all know what happened at the mass<br />\nmeeting held on Friday, January 5, 1907; so<br />\nbut a very brief summary of the business<br />\ntransacted need be given. The idea of the<br />\nmeeting was to discuss baseball, and surely<br />\nthat end was reached. The whole baseball<br />\nquestion was thrashed out, and definite action<br />\nwas taken.<br />\nPresident Plaggemeyer stated the position<br />\nof the Board of Governors in not recognizing<br /><br />\na baseball team. Then many of those interested in the matter arose and talked, sometimes on the subject, and again off. At last,<br />\nto the satisfaction of all present, a plan to<br />\nraise money by subscription was adopted.<br />\nThe general understanding was, that a team<br />\nwould be put on the field, provided the money<br />\nwere forthcoming. A committee was then<br />\nappointed to raise the money. Thus the question was definitely settled.<br />\nThe Board of Governors of the Athletic<br />\nAssociation met on the following Monday,<br />\nand elected Mr. John A Crane temporary<br />\nmanager of baseball, pending the recognition<br />\nof the sport. Until the committee should<br />\nmake a report, they could not recognize baseball. Probably before this is in print, the<br />\nsport will have been recognized.<br />\nNow let us bury the hatchet, and wash<br />\naway all war-paint. The misunderstanding<br />\nhas been cleared up, and Hopkins is hoping<br />\nfor a prosperous year in baseball. We feel<br />\nsure that baseball will receive as enthusiastic<br />\nsupport as the other teams. It only remains<br />\nfor the men to come out and work for the<br />\nteam. The captain has not yet been elected,<br />\nbut will probably be at the first meeting of<br />\nthe candidates. Get together and lick Virginia and St. John's this year, and bring fresh<br />\nlaurels to the Black and Blue.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nThe Freshman Class-pin has made its appearance. It is of rather attractive design, if<br />\nany class-pins may be said to be attractive.<br />\nWe note that the Freshmen seem to have<br />\nThe word<br />\nadopted Simplified Spelling.<br />\n\"University\" is spelled with a \"C\" instead<br />\nof an \"S.\" However they did not commit<br />\nthe error of having \"John Hopkins.\"<br />\nAlas and alack! The slot machine has been<br />\nrepaired! For about two weeks before the<br />\nXmas holidays, the slot machine in the basement was suffering from an extraordinary<br />\nailment. You could put in a cent and by a<br />\nlittle delicate maneuvering with the fingers,<br />\nyou would get, not only a piece of chocolate,<br />\nbut would even get back your cent, and some-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ntimes with interest. In this way, one cent<br />\ncould be used to get as many as five or six<br />\npieces of chocolate. Naturally, it didn't take<br />\nlong for this condition of affairs to become<br />\nknown. Then unfortunately, the game was<br />\nqueered in some way, and now you no longer<br />\nget your money back. In some way, Christhilf got wise.<br />\n\"Easter's next.\"<br /><br />\nLEVERING HALL.<br />\nAt a student meeting on January 9, Professor Palmer, of St. John's University in<br />\nShanghai, China, and Mr. Frank Slack, Traveling Secretary in the Eastern Colleges,<br />\nmade addresses on the opportunities open to<br />\nstudents in the important activities of modern<br />\nmissions.<br />\nProfessor Palmer told of the marvelous<br />\nawakening of a desire among the Chinese<br />\nfor western learning. This is evidenced in<br />\nthe fact that there are now nearly 15,000<br />\nChinese students in Japan, where they get<br />\nmodern institution more cheaply than they<br />\ncould by coming to America. The great need<br />\nfor Christian teachers in China should attract<br />\nmen of ability, who can inspire and direct the<br />\nlatent energy of China's men.<br />\nMr. Slack emphasized the necessity for the<br />\ncollege student to be informed on the lines of<br />\npresent missionary work. The interest<br />\nattaching to the study of missions is unsurpassed by that of any other study. In it we<br />\nget world-politics, geography, biography,<br />\nmodern history, adventure, romance; and<br />\nabove all the needs and opportunities of the<br />\nwork are impressed upon us.<br /><br />\nTwo classes for such study will be begun<br />\nthis month. One, led by Dr. Barret, will<br />\nstudy Dr. Grose's book, \"Aliens or Americans?\" This book treats the great immigration problem. The other class will study<br />\nforeign missions, using Mr. Mott's book,<br />\n\"The Evangelization of the World in This<br />\nGeneration.\" These classes are open to all<br />\nHopkins men. They will meet at times suitable to the members.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nTHE TRIALS OF AN EDITOR.<br />\nIn the first place it should be well understood, with few exceptions, that some of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER B o ard write the NEWSLETTER. The thing is done two hours or<br />\nless from the time the yellow rag goes to<br />\npress. We are forced to admit that this year<br />\none freshman did hand in sixteen ardent,<br />\nburning and melancholy verses at one time.<br />\n(Padding.) Also that there appears in this<br />\nissue a story also written by a member of the<br />\nfreshmen class which was accompanied by the<br />\nusual statement that \"it is based on facts!\"<br />\nAlso, \"If you will publish this in the NEWSLETTER, I will feel well repaid for my labors.\"<br />\nHe is well repaid. Then, too, we are in<br />\npossession of the following which is copied<br />\nverbatim.<br />\n\"DEAR C. : I just ran across the enclosed<br />\nwhich I wrote when I had a stomach ache this<br />\nsummer. Perhaps you can use it in the<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER.<br />\nVery truly,<br />\nF.\"<br />\nWhen the proof comes up it is usually<br />\n\"short,\" that is the Editor must fill up the<br />\nspace\u2014that is what the Editor is doing now.<br />\nThe University has not half so many sins<br />\nas would appear from the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nBut\u2014we must fill up the space or else write<br />\nlove sick poetry. We feel it much better to<br />\nwrite complaints to the students of the college than to the fair sex. If, by any chance,<br />\nsome freshman has written lovelorn verses to<br />\nsome girl of his acquaintance, upon its publication there is sure to appear an upper classman<br />\nwho objects that the editor has been making<br />\nfun of his lady love. (We are prepared to<br />\ngive facts.)<br />\nDid you ever study permutations and combinations ? I didn't, but they are really<br />\nnecessary to compute the number of corrections in the proof.<br />\nNow, Gentle Reader, this is our confession,<br />\nand although it is not entirely true, at least it<br />\nfills up space.<br /><br />\n.--0<br />\nOH, REGGY!<br />\nPercy\u2014Have you seen Grace George in<br />\n'Clothes?'<br />\nReggy\u2014Of course\u2014she's not in a comic<br />\nopera.\u2014Ex.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS UNDER-GRADUATE<br />\nCLUB.<br />\nWe can remember in looking over the files<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTERS and Hullabalos the<br />\nfutile attempts to form Senior Societies and<br />\nUnder-graduate Clubs. They always failed.<br />\nPerhaps they will always fail. The reason<br />\nthey failed is because no one has realized that<br />\nthere has been since the University started a<br />\nreal Undergraduate Club.<br />\nThe building is low and rakish, lingering<br />\nalong almost a block. It has a yellow weather<br />\nstained coat of paint and a pair of enormous<br />\niron lamps, heavy unto top heaviness. It was<br />\nonce a tavern on the Reisterstown Road before<br />\nthe houses in the neighborhood were built.<br />\nStroll in some night, entering a narrow<br />\npassage and dropping to your left down a little<br />\nflight of stairs. At nine o'clock the little<br />\ntables are empty, a drowsy negro waiter has<br />\nfallen asleep over his newspaper. Come in at<br />\nten, and there are five people in the place,<br />\neleven and the whole place is alert. The<br />\nwaiter is staggering under well laden trays,<br />\noysters, beer, highballs. At the tables yon<br />\nwill see club men in dress clothes, a group of<br />\nautomobilists warming up after a run into the<br />\nnight, two or three graduate students discussing organic chemistry and the faculty of this<br />\nand other universities. But in the back room<br />\nyou will usually find a party of undergraduates<br />\nalways at the same table, if possible, who<br />\ndiscuss the sins and shortcomings of their<br />\nelders in a pertinent and impertinent way, the<br />\natheletic outlook, the best way of passing<br />\nexaminations. A waste of time, say thou?<br />\nNo. I have heard William Blake and Dante<br />\nGabriel Rossetti discussed in sane and dispassionate language by boys who had failed<br />\nin English and the man who knew most<br />\nintimately the Roland Chanson was flunked<br />\nin French. And the remarkable part of it<br />\nwas that it was not put on for the benefit of<br />\nthose who might hear.<br />\nThere are, of course, certain habituees of<br />\nthe place. I hear that before my time there<br />\nwas a certain man called \"Mr. Pipp\" who<br />\nregularly went to sleep over his table.

It is good to drop in at<br />\nChristmas. And if you graduate and come<br />\nback looking up your old haunts, it may be<br />\nthat even Walter will have forgotten you at<br />\nthe University, your friends scattered to the<br />\nfour winds, but\u2014Joe and Sam will bound to<br />\naid you with your coat, and swear that they<br />\nknow you.<br />\nBe you a wise or foolish virgin, with your<br />\nlamp lit or not, you will find the door open\u2014<br />\nit has not been locked for eight years. They<br />\nhave lost the key.<br /><br />\nJACKSON'S METHOD.<br />\n(A Study in Success.)<br /><br />\nMontgomery Jackson was said by all to be<br />\na failure; he never would amount to any thing.<br />\nHe did get his degree on this side, it is true,<br />\nbut he was not expected to last two months<br />\nwhen he entered the medical school. Then<br />\nhe reformed.<br />\nNobody believed it, however, and his previous reputation preceded him to no great<br />\nadvantage on his part. But he worked and<br />\nworked. They did not throw him out.<br />\nI am not conversant with the technical<br />\nlanguage needed to make this history convincing, but here are the facts and the truth.<br />\nThe study of the venation of the embryo<br />\nwas at that time usually done (I am told) by<br />\nresolving a young pig into its lowest terms<br />\nwith a knife and several other necessary imimplements, Montgomery spoiled three pigs;<br />\nthen, growing impatient he dumped the<br />\nsupply of pigs into a pan in his locker and<br />\nwent to New York to see several new musical<br />\nshows and a certain young lady. The young<br />\nlady refused to marry him, because he had<br />\nshown no ability in his profession, and Montgomery came back determined to do or<br />\nNow, Montgomery was a very careless<br />\nyoung man, and his locker was most untidy.<br />\nThe pan in the locker was filled with the accumulation .of months of dumpings,chemicals,<br />\nantiseptics, foreign matter and six young pigs.<br />\nHe remembered as he read an article in a<br />\nGerman medical journal the attempts of the<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nprofession to render the embryos transparent.<br />\nHe smiled on the train as he thought of the<br />\nsix pigs in the pan, and to amuse himself<br />\nmade books on the rotting condition he would<br />\nfind them in. He wrote a parody on the \"six<br />\nlittle pigs went to market.\"<br />\nThen he forgot the matter. One day he<br />\nopened the locker. No stench. Six little pigs<br />\nlying calm and gelatine like. He picked up<br />\none after another. All perfectly transparent.<br />\nThe venation and muscles quite visible.<br />\n\"Jackson's Method\" appeared, bearing the<br />\nseal of the University. I believe he got favorable mention in Europe. The Medical School<br />\nwis honored by his presence. Montgomery<br />\ntook pains to analyze the mess in the bottom<br />\nof the pan and the formula is now in common<br />\nuse. They say that Jackson is a genius.<br />\nPerhaps.
