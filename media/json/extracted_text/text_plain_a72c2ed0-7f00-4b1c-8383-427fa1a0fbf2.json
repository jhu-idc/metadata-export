Wilson Shaffer<br />\n<br />\nCatch 63<br />\nThere are few occasions during an undergraduate's<br />\ncareer at the University at which time he is able to<br />\nassert his existence let alone his individuality. The \"education\" commences with a welcome address by Dr.<br />\nEisenhower at which time the entering freshman is told<br />\nthat he is paying for only one-third of his education,<br />\nthat the University grants him a \"scholarship\" for some<br />\n$2000 and that the student is more indebted to the<br />\npaternal institution than the institution is to the student<br />\nwho (unfortunately) is under the grave illusion that<br />\nhe is paying for his education.<br />\nThe next great awakening to the student comes<br />\nabout when he is told that women may not be entertained in the room he thinks he rents in the dormitory.<br />\nAgain an inversion of normal logic brings to light a new<br />\nfact; namely, that the student is a guest of the University, that he has only the privileges of a guest, despite<br />\nthe $800 he spends on his guest room in the Alumni<br />\nMemorial Residence.<br />\nPerhaps the gravest illusion of the Hopkins undergraduate entering Hopkins is that he is here to learn<br />\nhow to think. The motto of the University, that the truth<br />\nwill set you free, is affirmed only by considering it a<br />\nparadox. That is, the \"truth\" which we learn, we are<br />\nfree to 'hart' back on examinations and in discussions,<br />\nbut never is the \"truth\" denied or even questioned.<br />\nAs graduation approaches for one-fourth the student hotly, reflection upon four years of education can<br />\nlw sentimentally moving hut somewhat disappointing.<br />\nAt best the undergraduate can adjust to the reality<br />\nof the situation, admit that he was partially seduced<br />\nby the propaganda machines anti make his contribution<br />\nin setting the record straight.<br />\n<br />\nIndulgence From the Vatican<br />\nTh administration's agreement to allow freshmen<br />\ndormitory residents the privilege of entertaining female<br />\nguests in their rooms during specified hours of the<br />\n\"Big Weekend\" is an act of benevolence which is overwhelming in its generosity. It's up to the young gentlemen living in the Alumni Memorial Residences to live<br />\nup to the confidence which \"Homewood House\" has given<br />\nthem. Maybe if they behave well, next year's freshmen<br />\nwill be allowed to entertain guests in their rooms on a<br />\ngreater number of weekends, if they have their doors<br />\nopen and their mothers at hand.<br />\n<br />\nPhasing Out<br />\nThis issue of the News-Letter marks the conclusion<br />\nof the labors of the present staff to fill the yellow rag<br />\nwith truth sometimes. In the nostalgic spirit of this<br />\npoignant moment we permit ourselves the luxury of<br />\ndispensing at random certain thoughts which have found<br />\nno other outlet during the year:<br />\nGeorgian architecture is an excellent style for the<br />\ndesign of elegant country houses. To apply it to larger<br />\nbuildings is stretching a point. To crowd these overgrown farm houses too closely borders on the ugly.<br />\nThe one quality most conspicuously lacking at the<br />\nHop is a sense of humor, especially among so-called<br />\nstudent leaders. There is really very little an undergraduate need take seriously.<br />\nChaos is good. It thrives here and, for those who<br />\nlearn to live with it, provides a peculiarly,stimulating<br />\nenvironment. To live with chaos requires that one have<br />\nresources of one's own.<br />\nThe profound indifference shown toward the undergraduate is a mark of respect.

In this<br />\nplay the Asmod(-'e is Harry Fanning, a twenty year old English<br />\nboy nearing manhood.

Wilson Shaffer<br /><br />\nCatch 63<br />\nThere are few occasions during an undergraduate's<br />\ncareer at the University at which time he is able to<br />\nassert his existence let alone his individuality. The \"education\" commences with a welcome address by Dr.<br />\nEisenhower at which time the entering freshman is told<br />\nthat he is paying for only one-third of his education,<br />\nthat the University grants him a \"scholarship\" for some<br />\n$2000 and that the student is more indebted to the<br />\npaternal institution than the institution is to the student<br />\nwho (unfortunately) is under the grave illusion that<br />\nhe is paying for his education.<br />\nThe next great awakening to the student comes<br />\nabout when he is told that women may not be entertained in the room he thinks he rents in the dormitory.<br />\nAgain an inversion of normal logic brings to light a new<br />\nfact; namely, that the student is a guest of the University, that he has only the privileges of a guest, despite<br />\nthe $800 he spends on his guest room in the Alumni<br />\nMemorial Residence.<br />\nPerhaps the gravest illusion of the Hopkins undergraduate entering Hopkins is that he is here to learn<br />\nhow to think. The motto of the University, that the truth<br />\nwill set you free, is affirmed only by considering it a<br />\nparadox. That is, the \"truth\" which we learn, we are<br />\nfree to 'hart' back on examinations and in discussions,<br />\nbut never is the \"truth\" denied or even questioned.<br />\nAs graduation approaches for one-fourth the student hotly, reflection upon four years of education can<br />\nlw sentimentally moving hut somewhat disappointing.<br />\nAt best the undergraduate can adjust to the reality<br />\nof the situation, admit that he was partially seduced<br />\nby the propaganda machines anti make his contribution<br />\nin setting the record straight.<br /><br />\nIndulgence From the Vatican<br />\nTh administration's agreement to allow freshmen<br />\ndormitory residents the privilege of entertaining female<br />\nguests in their rooms during specified hours of the<br />\n\"Big Weekend\" is an act of benevolence which is overwhelming in its generosity. It's up to the young gentlemen living in the Alumni Memorial Residences to live<br />\nup to the confidence which \"Homewood House\" has given<br />\nthem. Maybe if they behave well, next year's freshmen<br />\nwill be allowed to entertain guests in their rooms on a<br />\ngreater number of weekends, if they have their doors<br />\nopen and their mothers at hand.<br /><br />\nPhasing Out<br />\nThis issue of the News-Letter marks the conclusion<br />\nof the labors of the present staff to fill the yellow rag<br />\nwith truth sometimes.
