The plan met with a good deal of comment and<br />\nsome ridicule. It cannot be said that up to this time it has been an<br />\nenthusiastic success. Still we have fifteen dollars\u2014and the Building<br />\nFund of the Trustees amounts we believed to only twenty-five. So<br />\nwe are not so very far behind. We contend that as a plan it is all<br />\nright. President Renzen favors it. The New York Evening Post<br />\ncalled attention to the Student Contribution Fund as an instance of<br />\nthe real interest shown in the welfare of this University by the<br />\nstudents herein.<br />\n<br />\nN this issue of the NEWS-LETTER will be found the first installment<br />\nof a series of \"Talks on the Poets.\" These papers are written by a<br />\nii.L!11<br />\ngentleman who is connected with the University and desires to<br />\nz<br />\nremain strictly anonymous. He has remarked to one of the Editors<br />\n34<br />\nthat he regrets the crude state in which his little chats are laid bei<br />\nfore his readers, but owing to the pressure of a very busy life, he<br />\n\u2022 -\u2039<br />\nhas been unable to do more than jot down some few thoughts on a few<br />\n0<br />\n\u2022 mg]R.Q(4L'i,igBfirk<br />\n.003<br />\nof the English poets.

To be more exact, it was \"we four.\"<br />\nSince we were always the closest of friends<br />\nin our college days, it was but natural that<br />\nat our decennial reunion we should get together to discuss old times. I remember that<br />\nas I looked at the other three men it seemed<br />\nbut yesterday since we had all said good-bye<br />\nto each other back at the old university.<br />\nOur conversation turned to our other mutual friends during our college days, of their<br />\nsuccesses and failures. \"The funniest thing<br />\nof all though,\" said Williams, the oldest of<br />\nthe four, \"is the way Jimmy Barnes has<br />\nturned out. Did you see him tonight? He's<br />\na big corporation lawyer now. I never thought<br />\nhe had it in him.<br />\n\"Yes, Jimmy's a success,\" replied Martin,<br />\n\"but did you ever hear the inside story of how<br />\nhe won his first case? it was Jimmy's beginning, and, to tell the truth, he quite outdid<br />\nhimself. I don't think he ever again quite<br />\ncame up to the mark he set that time.\"<br />\n\"0, I don't know,\" replied Williams.<br />\n\"Jimmy's an unprincipled sort of a chap, not<br />\nlacking in a certain kind of shrewdness, but<br />\nI don't think he's got the highest type of<br />\nbrains. But let's have the story.\"<br />\n\"You're about right there, Williams,\" answered Martin. \"Jimmy didn't show much<br />\nprinciple in his first case. One night when he<br />\nwas just confidentially drunk he told me the<br />\nstory. I'll begin at the time when he graduated in law. Jimmy was admitted to the bar,<br />\nand forthwith he considered himself a great<br />\nsuccess. That didn't last very long, though.<br />\nJimmy sat down in his office with his feet on<br />\nhis desk reading a novel and wearing out the<br />\nseat of his chair. The expected rush of clients<br />\ndidn't materialize, and at the end of six<br />\nmonths Jimmy realized that something was the<br />\nmatter. He was behind in his office rent, and<br />\nin the same condition as regards pretty near<br />\neverything else. If just at that time Jimmy<br />\nhadn't gotten his client heaven only knows<br />\nwhere he'd be now.<br />\n\"Well, Jimmy got a client. A man wandered into Jimmy's office with a tale of woe.<br />\nIt seems that he was the representative for<br />\nsome large Eastern trust company which was<br />\n<br />\nendeavoring to wrest control of a mine from<br />\nanother trust company. The control of the<br />\nmine hung on the securing of a block of stock<br />\nthat had been lost for some time. Both companies had discovered at about the same time<br />\nthe man who owned the missing block. Both<br />\ncompanies had immediately sent out representatives to secure the stock. Jimmy's client<br />\nwas the first to appear on the scene. He had<br />\nclosed the deal, gotten the stock and started<br />\nfor home. The home of the man who owned<br />\nthe stock was out in the country, some miles<br />\nfrom Jimmy's town, and the railroad station<br />\nwas in the town. The successful representative, whom we can call Smith for short,<br />\nstarted to drive to town after completing the<br />\ndeal. Very unfortunately, he was held up on<br />\nhis lonely drive and relieved of his suit case,<br />\npocket book and so forth, and among other<br />\nthings the coveted stock certificate. As soon<br />\nas Smith recovered from the shock of the<br />\nhold-up he drove on into town, where he found<br />\nthat the other representative had just arrived.<br />\nThen Smith showed his sense. Instead of<br />\nkicking up a row over the hold-up and the lost<br />\nstock, he went to see Jimmy and he told him<br />\nthe entire story. Jimmy listened to the story,<br />\nand told the man to wait in town a couple of<br />\ndays, and above all to keep quiet. Then Jimmy<br />\nstarted thinking it all out. The story of the<br />\nstock was all over town. The second representative, as soon as he found he had lost, had<br />\ntold the story of the entire race. The stock<br />\nwas of value to the two trust companies alone,<br />\nbut it was of immense value to them. The<br />\nhighwayman wouldn't have any use for it.<br />\nJimmy sat for a long time by himself smoking.<br />\nAt last he made up his mind. His office happened to be in the hotel, the only hotel in the<br />\ntown.<br />\n\"As soon as Jimmy made up his mind what<br />\nto do he wasn't long in doing it. He got up<br />\nand went over and carefully locked the door.<br />\nNext he took his coat off and rolled up his<br />\nsleeves. Then he went to his closet, took out<br />\na hatchet and went for his desk. He told me<br />\nsometime ago that he took a fiendish pleasure<br />\nin battering up that desk. It wasn't paid for.<br />\nHe smashed the cover, carefully locked all<br />\nthe drawers, then broke them open with his<br />\nhatchet. He picked up the tin box that served<br />\nhim as a safe and banged the top off. As soon<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nas the work of destruction was completed he<br />\nwent for his papers. He pulled packets of<br />\nletters to pieces and strewed them over the<br />\nfloor. He emptied all the pigeon holes in his<br />\ndesk, added some blank note paper to it and<br />\nthrew it helter-skelter over the top of his<br />\ndesk. Finally he broke the glass in the door<br />\nand kicked over his waste basket. Then he<br />\nput on his coat again, and, leaving the door<br />\nunlocked, went out and called on his client.<br />\nA couple of hours later Jimmy and Smith<br />\nentered the hotel and seated themselves in the<br />\nlobby. They sat there for sometime, keeping<br />\ntheir eyes fixed on the door. A couple of<br />\nhours after dinner, about 9 o'clock, the representative of the second trust company came<br />\nin and immediately went to his room. As<br />\nsoon as he had disappeared Jimmy and his<br />\nclient arose and went up to Jimmy's office.<br />\nAs soon as they reached the office the fun<br />\ncommenced. As you all probably remember,<br />\nJimmy led the cheering section back at the<br />\nuniversity, and his lungs have lost none of<br />\ntheir old power. Well, Jimmy started to yell<br />\nand anything<br />\n\"Thief!\"Murder!\"Help<br />\nIn less time<br />\nattention.<br />\nattract<br />\nwould<br />\nelse that<br />\nin the<br />\neverybody<br />\nabout,<br />\ntell<br />\nto<br />\nit<br />\ntakes<br />\nthan<br />\nlistenoffice,<br />\nJimmy's<br />\ninto<br />\ncrowding<br />\nhotel was<br />\nan<br />\nwas<br />\nJimmy<br />\nloss.<br />\nhis<br />\nof<br />\ning to the story<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\nthere,<br />\nout<br />\nfellow<br />\npopular<br />\nawfully<br />\nstory caused great excitement among his<br />\nfriends. Jimmy kept up talking about his<br />\nfearful loss. The stock certificate, which, he<br />\nsaid, Smith had just deposited with him, was<br />\nthe only thing missing. Jimmy chose his moment for making this announcement well\u2014the<br />\nvery moment the other representative appeared on the scene Jimmy made the discovery. As soon as jimmy caught sight of this<br />\nman he made his bold stroke.<br />\n\"'There he is,' he cried, pointing to the sec- ond representative; 'there's the man who stole<br />\nmy certificate. Search him\u2014he's got it. I<br />\nknow he's got it!'<br />\n\"The crowd was with Jimmy. With a kind<br />\nof a dull roar it turned and swept up to the<br />\nplace where the poor man was standing. Before he had a chance to get away he was<br />\nseized by many hands. Resistance was useless. He was thrown down and his pockets<br />\nquickly emptied. Suddenly one of the searchers jumped up.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n\"'Here it is he yelled. 'Here it is! Ten<br />\nthousand shares in the Onaconda Gold Mine!<br />\nHere it is!'<br />\n\"Then, strange to say, Jimmy's client produced a receipt, signed by Jimmy a few hours<br />\npreviously, for ten thousand shares in the<br />\nOnaconda Gold Mine. The proof was positive. The representative of the New York<br />\ntrust company had been caught with the<br />\ngoods. The certificate was handed over to<br />\nJimmy and the prisoner was hurried off to<br />\njail.<br />\n\"That's about all. Jimmy and his client<br />\ncame East to New York on the midnight train<br />\nthat night. The next day the other representative established an alibi and proved that he<br />\nhad bought the stock from one of the most<br />\nnotorious rascals in the town. He was released and at once returned to New York.<br />\nJimmy was appointed junior attorney for the<br />\ntrust company he had served. He never has<br />\nbeen West since. That town would be too hot<br />\nto hold Jimmy\u2014a Westerner never can forgive being made a fool of.\"<br />\nAt that moment a figure loomed up in the<br />\ndoorway, and Williams leaped to his feet.<br />\n\"Why, here's Jimmy now! How are you,<br />\nold man? We were just talking about you.<br />\nLet's all go and have a drink.\"<br />\n<br />\nTHE Y. M. C. A. RECEPTION.<br />\nThe annual reception of the Young Men's<br />\nChristian Association to the incoming students<br />\ntook place in Levering Hall on Friday night,<br />\nOctober 4th. Dr. C. F. Swartz, the president<br />\nof the association, presided. In the absence<br />\nof President Remsen, whom, we regret to say,<br />\nwas prevented from coming by a serious cold,<br />\nDean Griffen made a short address of welcome. Short talks on the various phases of<br />\ncollege life and undergraduate interests were<br />\nmade by Messrs. Chesney, Brenton, Schmeiser, Hughes and Chew. Mr. William Schmeisser, representing the class of 1902, presented<br />\nthe lacrosse medals, won by last year's junior<br />\nteam against the freshmen, to the class of<br />\n1908. Following this Mr. Frank Slack, of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, made a short address, and the reception closed with a light<br />\ncollation.<br />\nThe new Y. M. C. A. handbook \u2014 \"The<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHU NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nFreshman's Bible\"\u2014is very well gotten up. A<br />\nnew feature is a short memoranda for each<br />\nday of the collegiate year.

The advice they offer is<br />\ngood.<br />\n<br />\nWALTER.<br />\nWalter is back at his old stand, probably<br />\nthe most universally welcomed of all those<br />\nwho have come back to the University. His<br />\nworld-famous tonic has made him a little more<br />\nbald, but he is as consummate a flatterer and<br />\nas arrant a hypocrite as ever.

Of these three volumes<br />\nThe Upton Letters is probably most widely<br />\nknown, but is not, in the opinion of the present writer, so good a piece of work as its successor, From a College Window. The earlier<br />\nvolume treats of a variety of subjects, and<br />\nis in the form of a series of letters by a schoolmaster to a friend who has been compelled by<br />\nill-health to leave England. The second volume is a group of essays not connected by a<br />\ntiny web of plot, such as is used in The Upton<br />\nLetters. Mr. Benson writes charmingly on<br />\nsuch subjects as \"Books,\" \"Beauty\" and \"Art,\"<br />\n\"Ambition,\" \"Egotism\" and \"The Simple<br />\nLife.\" He offers few new thoughts, suggestions and ideas, but he clothes old ones in the<br />\nquiet but lovely garments of pure, simple,<br />\nlucid English. \u2022 We recognize over and over<br />\nagain our own ideas, but how transformed! as<br />\nthough a friend who long since parted from<br />\nus in poverty comes to us once more radiant<br />\nin the beauty of prosperity and happiness and<br />\nholiness.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nNot long since I saw on the New 13)ok<br />\nShelf Prof. Walter Raleigh's new Life of<br />\nShakespeare, in the English Men of Letters<br />\nseries. The \"Wordsworth\" of Frederick<br />\nMyers has generally been considered the masterpiece of all these lives. Prof. Raleigh's<br />\nwork can, I believe, dispute precedence with<br />\nit. Not erudite, as is Fleay, nor exhaustive, as<br />\nis Lee, the essays which go to form this little<br />\nbook present as delightful criticisms of<br />\nShakespeare as I have ever read\u2014scholarly,<br />\ninstructive, broad-minded and written by a<br />\nveritable master of style. Prof. Raleigh's<br />\npower of exact quotation may well be the envy<br />\nof the student of Shakespeare. As an example both of this and of his command of<br />\nEnglish, read the last two pages of this ex<br />\ncellent work.<br />\nSome critics have placed Mr. Percy McVey, the author of \"Sappho and Phaon,\" on<br />\na level with Stephen Phillips. I have read the<br />\ntragedy with care, and, though I have found<br />\nthere dramatic skill and poetic talent, I cannot<br />\nsay that it can for a moment compare with<br />\n\"Paolo and Francesca,\" the earliest and greatest of Mr. Phillips' tragedies. I say \"greatest\" because, though some passages in<br />\n\"Ulysses\" and \"Herod\" may be considered<br />\nfiner, in their entirety they cannot compare to<br />\nthe earlier play. \"Sappho and Phaon\" is constructed with remarkable care, the Prologue<br />\nand Induction evincing great ingenuity on the<br />\npart of the author. The \"Tragedy\" itself, as<br />\nis well known, will be presented on the stage<br />\nthis winter, while it is said the entire work\u2014<br />\nPrologue,Induction and Tragedy\u2014is to be performed by the students of Harvard University at some time in the near future. Meanwhile, the perusal of the beautiful play will<br />\nwell repay all readers.<br />\n<br />\nFOOTBALL<br />\nThis year has seen a marked change in the<br />\nfootball policy at the University.

The desire is to<br />\nhave a homogeneous eleven, where each<br />\nplayer is familiar with his neighbor's style of<br />\nplay, and where team play, and not individual<br />\nplay, is paramount. To accomplish this end<br />\nit is absolutely essential that every undergraduate make some effort to help the team. This<br />\ncan be done in two ways\u2014first, by becoming<br />\na candidate for the team; second, by buying<br />\na season ticket, attending every game and<br />\njoining in the rooting.<br />\nThere is a splendid' opportunity for every<br />\nundergrad this year.

I never used to care for him<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nmuch, but lately he has, as it were, fascinated<br />\nme. Those ballads of his are marvelous,\"The<br />\nWhite Ship\" and \"The King's Tragedy,\"<br />\nespecially.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014I can't say I am very fond of<br />\nRossetti's ballads. In my poor opinion they<br />\nare often tedious, as, for instance, \"Dante at<br />\nVerona,\" and then Rossetti, with all his skill<br />\nin devising a refrain, was apt to provoke parody too easily\u2014Miss Carolyn Wells' \"Bacon<br />\nand Eggs and a Bar o' Soap,\" or Calverly's<br />\nsimilar refrain are too pain fully near those of<br />\n\"Helen's Bower\" and \"Lilith.\" The grandeur<br />\nof such ballads as \"The King's Tragedy\" is,<br />\nhowever, not marred by any such artificialities. They, I admit, are fine, though none are<br />\nequal to a poem written in Tennyson's extreme<br />\nyouth\u2014the incomparable \"Ballad of Ariana,\"<br />\nwhich, by the way, is an example of the poem<br />\nwith a refrain of beauty and simplicity. It is<br />\na monument to Tennyson's genius that at 23<br />\nhe should have written a ballad which remains<br />\nunequaled by any similar work of the preRaphaelites, though that field of poetry was<br />\npeculiarly theirs.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014But I have very often heard<br />\nyou speak of Rossetti as one of your favorite<br />\npoets, yet you seem quite down on him today.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014He is one of my favorite poets<br />\nbecause he is the author of two poems, \"The<br />\n\"Portrait\" and \"The Blessed Damozel.\" I<br />\nreally cannot make up my mind which is the<br />\nfiner, but I suppose the palm must go to \"The<br />\nBlessed Damozel.\" It is certainly his most<br />\nwidely known poem.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Do you believe it true that<br />\nRossetti wrote it as a sequel to \"The Raven\"?<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Not so much a sequel as a kind<br />\nof complimentary poem. Poe pictured the<br />\nnever-ending desolation of the lover on earth<br />\nRossetti, the \u2022 sadness of the beloved one in<br />\nheaven\u2014sadness intermingled with a holy<br />\nhope.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014It's almost a pity he attempted<br />\nto rival such a poem.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Do you think so? I honestly<br />\nthink \"The Raven\" nothing more than a tour<br />\nde force\u2014not to be compared in beauty to<br />\nseveral other poems of Poe, particularly \"The<br />\nHaunted Palace,\" \"To Helen\" and one or two<br />\nothers. It may be rank heresy, but I think<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"The Blessed Damozel\" is far finer.<br />\nbeauty of such lines as<br />\n\"But whose velvet, violet lining with the lamplight floating o'er,<br />\nShe shall pass, ah, nevermore!\"<br />\nThe Critic\u2014But aren't they, after all, mere<br />\ntricks of alteration? They aren't as barefaced as those of Swinburne, and are more<br />\nstriking than his, because the ear is not o'erburdened with a flow of sound, but there are<br />\nlines in Rossetti's poem as far superior to<br />\n\"The Raven\" as Poe's work is to that of the<br />\ncrowd of poeticules whom he hated and scorned. Just get me down that Rosetti\u2014on the shelf<br />\nby the door\u2014that's it. Let me read you a few<br />\nlines. Mr. Swinburne praised many of them<br />\nlong ago in his essay\u2014a magnificent piece of<br />\nEnglish which you *ought to read\u2014and Mr.<br />\nStedman, in his \"Victorian Poets,\" has called<br />\nattention to some. I'm not sure whether he<br />\ngives special mention to these:<br />\n\"She spoke through the still weather;<br />\nHer voice was like the voice the stars<br />\nHad when they sang together.\"<br />\nSurely, her voice was not unlike the words<br />\nused to describe it.<br />\nOr the steadfast dignity of such lines as:<br />\n\"The light thrilled towards her, filled<br />\nWith angels in strong, level flight.\"<br />\nAnd you, dear boy, with your imagination,<br />\nmust almost hear the loving wistfulness with<br />\nwhich she says:<br />\n\"When round his head the aureole clings.\"<br />\nAnd then the imagination of it! How exquisite is the artistry of the poet who could so<br />\nconnect the ideas of earth and heaven that<br />\nthe \"gold bar of heaven\" was made warm by<br />\nan immortal yet human bosom. Notice, too,<br />\nthe awfulness of heaven, suggested by the fact<br />\nthat the \"wonder was not yet quite gone\"<br />\nfrom her face, albeit she had been there ten<br />\nyears.<br />\nI said awhile ago that \"The Portrait\" was<br />\nalso a favorite poem of mine. In it Rossetti<br />\nforgets or discards his mannerisms to a great<br />\nextent, and appears more as a follower of<br />\nTennyson than in any other poem. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. W. M. Rossetti<br />\nhas stated that there is no real foundation for<br />\nthis poem, I sometimes feel as if it must have<br />\nbeen inspired by an actual loss. I have often<br />\nseen in my mind's eye the poet seated in that<br />\n<br />\ndark room in Cheyney Walk, with the deadly<br />\nchloral bottle near by. In his hands is a canvas, unframed, and on the rude stuff is painted<br />\none of his early glorious heads. He sits there<br />\nsilently, alone.<br />\n\"I gaze until she seems to stir,<br />\nUntil mine eyes almost aver<br />\nThat now, even now, the sweet lips part<br />\nTo breathe the words of the sweet heart\u2014<br />\nAnd yet the earth is over her.<br />\nI feel that \"the spring water\" and the \"dull<br />\nraindrops,\" and the \"talk and long, sweet<br />\nsilences\" must be part of a sad, true tale.<br />\nI have said that the poem is not unlike Tennyson in style. Two lines in particular are in<br />\nthe finest spirit of such poems as \"Ulysses.\"<br />\nThey are:<br />\n\"Upon the desolate verge of light<br />\nYearned loud the iron-bounded sea.\"<br />\nThey are almost equal to:<br />\n\"The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;<br />\nThe long day wanes; the slow moon climbs;<br />\nthe deep<br />\nMoans round with many voices.\"<br />\nThe Reader\u2014How superb that is! I have<br />\noften wondered why the school founded by<br />\nRossetti and Morris has had no continuation<br />\nin this generation.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014The reason is, I believe, that<br />\nthe two poets were apart from the interests of<br />\ntheir time, and nothing in art that is not in<br />\nsympathy with the thought and feeling of the<br />\nage can hope to have more than a fleeting<br />\nexistence. Again, any such movement as<br />\ntheirs is almost certain to degenerate into a<br />\nfad. Gautier was sincere in his plea for \"Art<br />\nfor Art's Sake ;\" the pre-Raphaelites were sincere in their similar opinions. Gautier was<br />\nnot a \"crank\" even when he appeared in his<br />\nfamous green trousers. Oscar Wild, the<br />\n\"apostle of reform in dress,\" the decadent descendant of a zroup of men of real genius\u2014<br />\nhe and others like him are responsible for the<br />\ndisappearance from our literature of men of<br />\nRossetti's genius and Morris' taste. \"Neo<br />\nRomanticism,\" and \"Pre-Raphaelitism,\" and<br />\n\"The English Renaissance\"\u2014they all became<br />\npart of a fad. The sooner Wilde and his kind<br />\nare forgotten the better for our literature.<br />\nIt is not to that sickly apostle of Wilde, that<br />\nmorbid young New Yorker, George Sylvester<br />\nWhat's-His-Name, whom we must look for the<br />\n<br />\n\f11<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncontinuationof the traditions and glories of our<br />\nliterature. Rather is it towards young, enthusiastic Alfred Noyes, the singer of \"Sherwood<br />\nin the Twilight\" and of \"View in Lilac Time.\"<br />\nSpeaking of followers and disciples of<br />\npoets, it is a fact of some interest that William Watson receives bare mention from Stedman as \"a disciple of Morris, and a good one.\"<br />\nMr. Stedman, of course, could only judge by<br />\n\"The Prince's Quest,\" and such early powerless work. But to us, who have read the work<br />\nof. the \"Virgilian poet's\" maturity, and particularly his stern and yet brilliant elegic<br />\npoems, it seems strang, indeed, that he should<br />\nhave ever been classed with the wielder of gorgeous imagery, the worshiper of mere beauty,<br />\nthe \"idle singer of an empty day,\" William<br />\nMorris.<br />\nWatson's work is, I believe, bound to live.<br />\nHe is, as someone has said, \"as promising a<br />\ncandidate for poetic length of days as this age<br />\nhas to show.\" I mentioned but now his<br />\nmemorial poems. Let me find my favorite of<br />\nhis verses. Let me see\u2014let me see\u2014here it is.<br />\n\"A Child's Hair.\" His mastery of Bruns' favorite meter is here and elsewhere perfect.<br />\nListen to this:<br />\n\"From such a frolic head t'was shorn, .<br />\n'Tis scarce five years since he was born;<br />\nNot sunlight scampering over corn<br />\nWere merrier thing.<br />\nA child? A fragment of the morn;<br />\nA piece of spring.<br />\nHere, too, is another example of the same<br />\nstanzaic form from the lines on Matthew Arnold:<br />\n\"Great is the facile conqueror;<br />\nYet haply he who, wounded sore,<br />\nBreathless, unhorsed, all covered o'er<br />\nWith blood and sweat,<br />\nSinks foiled, but fighting evermore,<br />\nIs greater yet.\"<br />\nThis is not only noble verse; it is noble<br />\ntruth.<br />\n<br />\nSTUDIO<br />\nILGENFRITZ<br />\nto cumuiris<br />\nSuccessor<br />\n<br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n20 West Lexington Street<br />\nSpecial Discount to Students<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\n<br />\nNOVELTIES<br />\n<br />\nCharles Bonner<br />\n568 WEST FRANKLIN STREET<br />\n<br />\nCARL C.

VAC<br /><br />\nV<br />\n4<br />\n714r<br />\nV<br />\nVVVVVVVVVVV<br />\n*<br /><br />\n;Mk<br /><br />\nYEAR ago, that is in its first issue of last year, the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nadvanced the scheme of the Student Contribution Fund for building<br />\nat Homewood. The plan met with a good deal of comment and<br />\nsome ridicule. It cannot be said that up to this time it has been an<br />\nenthusiastic success. Still we have fifteen dollars\u2014and the Building<br />\nFund of the Trustees amounts we believed to only twenty-five. So<br />\nwe are not so very far behind. We contend that as a plan it is all<br />\nright. President Renzen favors it. The New York Evening Post<br />\ncalled attention to the Student Contribution Fund as an instance of<br />\nthe real interest shown in the welfare of this University by the<br />\nstudents herein.<br /><br />\nN this issue of the NEWS-LETTER will be found the first installment<br />\nof a series of \"Talks on the Poets.\" These papers are written by a<br />\nii.L!11<br />\ngentleman who is connected with the University and desires to<br />\nz<br />\nremain strictly anonymous. He has remarked to one of the Editors<br />\n34<br />\nthat he regrets the crude state in which his little chats are laid bei<br />\nfore his readers, but owing to the pressure of a very busy life, he<br />\n\u2022 -\u2039<br />\nhas been unable to do more than jot down some few thoughts on a few<br />\n0<br />\n\u2022 mg]R.Q(4L'i,igBfirk<br />\n.003<br />\nof the English poets. The NEWS-LETTER trusts that this series will<br />\n.<br />\n\u201e<br />\nprove not unenjoyable to many members of the University, while to<br />\na few, whose taste lead them in the direction of poetry, it may<br />\nprove positively enjoyable because therein they may find the reflection of their own views on<br />\ntheir own favorite poems and poets.<br />\nZs<br /><br />\n;Tt [11 fit]<br />\nis-40140i<br />\nii,a8#13Tg!!<br />\ngig.g;<br /><br />\nCRADLE-SONG.<br />\n\"Quand tu chantes, bercee<br />\nLe soir, entre Ines bras\" etc.<br />\n(After Victor Hugh.)<br /><br />\nWhen you sing at even-tide<br />\nIn my arms, do you then know<br />\nOf the thoughts which come to me?<br />\nAnswer, dear one, answer low.<br />\nThe sweet song brings back to me<br />\nThe fairest of my days\u2014<br />\nThen sing, ah sing, my darling<br />\nSing to me always.<br />\nWhen you smile, upon your lips<br />\nLove himself is seen to play,<br />\nThen suddenly the fleeting elf<br />\nFades and vanishes away.<br />\nAh, such honest laughter proves<br />\nA heart beyond my praise;<br />\nThen smile, oh smile, my darling<br />\nSmile on me always.<br />\nWhen you sleep so calm and pure<br />\nIn the shadow near my eyes,<br />\nSoftly then you breathe the words<br />\nOf divinest harmonies<br />\nI see your loveliness, my love,<br />\nThere in the silence deep\u2014<br />\nSo sleep beside me, darling,<br />\nSleep, forever sleep.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nJIMMY'S FIRST CASE.<br />\nThere were four of us who gathered together in the cardroom after our reunion banquet. To be more exact, it was \"we four.\"<br />\nSince we were always the closest of friends<br />\nin our college days, it was but natural that<br />\nat our decennial reunion we should get together to discuss old times. I remember that<br />\nas I looked at the other three men it seemed<br />\nbut yesterday since we had all said good-bye<br />\nto each other back at the old university.<br />\nOur conversation turned to our other mutual friends during our college days, of their<br />\nsuccesses and failures. \"The funniest thing<br />\nof all though,\" said Williams, the oldest of<br />\nthe four, \"is the way Jimmy Barnes has<br />\nturned out. Did you see him tonight? He's<br />\na big corporation lawyer now. I never thought<br />\nhe had it in him.<br />\n\"Yes, Jimmy's a success,\" replied Martin,<br />\n\"but did you ever hear the inside story of how<br />\nhe won his first case? it was Jimmy's beginning, and, to tell the truth, he quite outdid<br />\nhimself. I don't think he ever again quite<br />\ncame up to the mark he set that time.\"<br />\n\"0, I don't know,\" replied Williams.<br />\n\"Jimmy's an unprincipled sort of a chap, not<br />\nlacking in a certain kind of shrewdness, but<br />\nI don't think he's got the highest type of<br />\nbrains. But let's have the story.\"<br />\n\"You're about right there, Williams,\" answered Martin. \"Jimmy didn't show much<br />\nprinciple in his first case. One night when he<br />\nwas just confidentially drunk he told me the<br />\nstory. I'll begin at the time when he graduated in law. Jimmy was admitted to the bar,<br />\nand forthwith he considered himself a great<br />\nsuccess. That didn't last very long, though.<br />\nJimmy sat down in his office with his feet on<br />\nhis desk reading a novel and wearing out the<br />\nseat of his chair. The expected rush of clients<br />\ndidn't materialize, and at the end of six<br />\nmonths Jimmy realized that something was the<br />\nmatter. He was behind in his office rent, and<br />\nin the same condition as regards pretty near<br />\neverything else. If just at that time Jimmy<br />\nhadn't gotten his client heaven only knows<br />\nwhere he'd be now.<br />\n\"Well, Jimmy got a client. A man wandered into Jimmy's office with a tale of woe.<br />\nIt seems that he was the representative for<br />\nsome large Eastern trust company which was<br /><br />\nendeavoring to wrest control of a mine from<br />\nanother trust company. The control of the<br />\nmine hung on the securing of a block of stock<br />\nthat had been lost for some time. Both companies had discovered at about the same time<br />\nthe man who owned the missing block. Both<br />\ncompanies had immediately sent out representatives to secure the stock. Jimmy's client<br />\nwas the first to appear on the scene. He had<br />\nclosed the deal, gotten the stock and started<br />\nfor home. The home of the man who owned<br />\nthe stock was out in the country, some miles<br />\nfrom Jimmy's town, and the railroad station<br />\nwas in the town. The successful representative, whom we can call Smith for short,<br />\nstarted to drive to town after completing the<br />\ndeal. Very unfortunately, he was held up on<br />\nhis lonely drive and relieved of his suit case,<br />\npocket book and so forth, and among other<br />\nthings the coveted stock certificate. As soon<br />\nas Smith recovered from the shock of the<br />\nhold-up he drove on into town, where he found<br />\nthat the other representative had just arrived.<br />\nThen Smith showed his sense. Instead of<br />\nkicking up a row over the hold-up and the lost<br />\nstock, he went to see Jimmy and he told him<br />\nthe entire story. Jimmy listened to the story,<br />\nand told the man to wait in town a couple of<br />\ndays, and above all to keep quiet. Then Jimmy<br />\nstarted thinking it all out. The story of the<br />\nstock was all over town. The second representative, as soon as he found he had lost, had<br />\ntold the story of the entire race. The stock<br />\nwas of value to the two trust companies alone,<br />\nbut it was of immense value to them. The<br />\nhighwayman wouldn't have any use for it.<br />\nJimmy sat for a long time by himself smoking.<br />\nAt last he made up his mind. His office happened to be in the hotel, the only hotel in the<br />\ntown.<br />\n\"As soon as Jimmy made up his mind what<br />\nto do he wasn't long in doing it. He got up<br />\nand went over and carefully locked the door.<br />\nNext he took his coat off and rolled up his<br />\nsleeves. Then he went to his closet, took out<br />\na hatchet and went for his desk. He told me<br />\nsometime ago that he took a fiendish pleasure<br />\nin battering up that desk. It wasn't paid for.<br />\nHe smashed the cover, carefully locked all<br />\nthe drawers, then broke them open with his<br />\nhatchet. He picked up the tin box that served<br />\nhim as a safe and banged the top off. As soon<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nas the work of destruction was completed he<br />\nwent for his papers. He pulled packets of<br />\nletters to pieces and strewed them over the<br />\nfloor. He emptied all the pigeon holes in his<br />\ndesk, added some blank note paper to it and<br />\nthrew it helter-skelter over the top of his<br />\ndesk. Finally he broke the glass in the door<br />\nand kicked over his waste basket. Then he<br />\nput on his coat again, and, leaving the door<br />\nunlocked, went out and called on his client.<br />\nA couple of hours later Jimmy and Smith<br />\nentered the hotel and seated themselves in the<br />\nlobby. They sat there for sometime, keeping<br />\ntheir eyes fixed on the door. A couple of<br />\nhours after dinner, about 9 o'clock, the representative of the second trust company came<br />\nin and immediately went to his room. As<br />\nsoon as he had disappeared Jimmy and his<br />\nclient arose and went up to Jimmy's office.<br />\nAs soon as they reached the office the fun<br />\ncommenced. As you all probably remember,<br />\nJimmy led the cheering section back at the<br />\nuniversity, and his lungs have lost none of<br />\ntheir old power. Well, Jimmy started to yell<br />\nand anything<br />\n\"Thief!\"Murder!\"Help<br />\nIn less time<br />\nattention.<br />\nattract<br />\nwould<br />\nelse that<br />\nin the<br />\neverybody<br />\nabout,<br />\ntell<br />\nto<br />\nit<br />\ntakes<br />\nthan<br />\nlistenoffice,<br />\nJimmy's<br />\ninto<br />\ncrowding<br />\nhotel was<br />\nan<br />\nwas<br />\nJimmy<br />\nloss.<br />\nhis<br />\nof<br />\ning to the story<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\nthere,<br />\nout<br />\nfellow<br />\npopular<br />\nawfully<br />\nstory caused great excitement among his<br />\nfriends. Jimmy kept up talking about his<br />\nfearful loss. The stock certificate, which, he<br />\nsaid, Smith had just deposited with him, was<br />\nthe only thing missing. Jimmy chose his moment for making this announcement well\u2014the<br />\nvery moment the other representative appeared on the scene Jimmy made the discovery. As soon as jimmy caught sight of this<br />\nman he made his bold stroke.<br />\n\"'There he is,' he cried, pointing to the sec- ond representative; 'there's the man who stole<br />\nmy certificate. Search him\u2014he's got it. I<br />\nknow he's got it!'<br />\n\"The crowd was with Jimmy. With a kind<br />\nof a dull roar it turned and swept up to the<br />\nplace where the poor man was standing. Before he had a chance to get away he was<br />\nseized by many hands. Resistance was useless. He was thrown down and his pockets<br />\nquickly emptied. Suddenly one of the searchers jumped up.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n\"'Here it is he yelled. 'Here it is! Ten<br />\nthousand shares in the Onaconda Gold Mine!<br />\nHere it is!'<br />\n\"Then, strange to say, Jimmy's client produced a receipt, signed by Jimmy a few hours<br />\npreviously, for ten thousand shares in the<br />\nOnaconda Gold Mine. The proof was positive. The representative of the New York<br />\ntrust company had been caught with the<br />\ngoods. The certificate was handed over to<br />\nJimmy and the prisoner was hurried off to<br />\njail.<br />\n\"That's about all. Jimmy and his client<br />\ncame East to New York on the midnight train<br />\nthat night. The next day the other representative established an alibi and proved that he<br />\nhad bought the stock from one of the most<br />\nnotorious rascals in the town. He was released and at once returned to New York.<br />\nJimmy was appointed junior attorney for the<br />\ntrust company he had served. He never has<br />\nbeen West since. That town would be too hot<br />\nto hold Jimmy\u2014a Westerner never can forgive being made a fool of.\"<br />\nAt that moment a figure loomed up in the<br />\ndoorway, and Williams leaped to his feet.<br />\n\"Why, here's Jimmy now! How are you,<br />\nold man? We were just talking about you.<br />\nLet's all go and have a drink.\"<br /><br />\nTHE Y. M. C. A.

In the absence<br />\nof President Remsen, whom, we regret to say,<br />\nwas prevented from coming by a serious cold,<br />\nDean Griffen made a short address of welcome. Short talks on the various phases of<br />\ncollege life and undergraduate interests were<br />\nmade by Messrs. Chesney, Brenton, Schmeiser, Hughes and Chew. Mr. William Schmeisser, representing the class of 1902, presented<br />\nthe lacrosse medals, won by last year's junior<br />\nteam against the freshmen, to the class of<br />\n1908.

Of these three volumes<br />\nThe Upton Letters is probably most widely<br />\nknown, but is not, in the opinion of the present writer, so good a piece of work as its successor, From a College Window. The earlier<br />\nvolume treats of a variety of subjects, and<br />\nis in the form of a series of letters by a schoolmaster to a friend who has been compelled by<br />\nill-health to leave England. The second volume is a group of essays not connected by a<br />\ntiny web of plot, such as is used in The Upton<br />\nLetters. Mr. Benson writes charmingly on<br />\nsuch subjects as \"Books,\" \"Beauty\" and \"Art,\"<br />\n\"Ambition,\" \"Egotism\" and \"The Simple<br />\nLife.\" He offers few new thoughts, suggestions and ideas, but he clothes old ones in the<br />\nquiet but lovely garments of pure, simple,<br />\nlucid English. \u2022 We recognize over and over<br />\nagain our own ideas, but how transformed! as<br />\nthough a friend who long since parted from<br />\nus in poverty comes to us once more radiant<br />\nin the beauty of prosperity and happiness and<br />\nholiness.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nNot long since I saw on the New 13)ok<br />\nShelf Prof. Walter Raleigh's new Life of<br />\nShakespeare, in the English Men of Letters<br />\nseries. The \"Wordsworth\" of Frederick<br />\nMyers has generally been considered the masterpiece of all these lives. Prof. Raleigh's<br />\nwork can, I believe, dispute precedence with<br />\nit. Not erudite, as is Fleay, nor exhaustive, as<br />\nis Lee, the essays which go to form this little<br />\nbook present as delightful criticisms of<br />\nShakespeare as I have ever read\u2014scholarly,<br />\ninstructive, broad-minded and written by a<br />\nveritable master of style. Prof. Raleigh's<br />\npower of exact quotation may well be the envy<br />\nof the student of Shakespeare. As an example both of this and of his command of<br />\nEnglish, read the last two pages of this ex<br />\ncellent work.<br />\nSome critics have placed Mr. Percy McVey, the author of \"Sappho and Phaon,\" on<br />\na level with Stephen Phillips. I have read the<br />\ntragedy with care, and, though I have found<br />\nthere dramatic skill and poetic talent, I cannot<br />\nsay that it can for a moment compare with<br />\n\"Paolo and Francesca,\" the earliest and greatest of Mr. Phillips' tragedies. I say \"greatest\" because, though some passages in<br />\n\"Ulysses\" and \"Herod\" may be considered<br />\nfiner, in their entirety they cannot compare to<br />\nthe earlier play. \"Sappho and Phaon\" is constructed with remarkable care, the Prologue<br />\nand Induction evincing great ingenuity on the<br />\npart of the author. The \"Tragedy\" itself, as<br />\nis well known, will be presented on the stage<br />\nthis winter, while it is said the entire work\u2014<br />\nPrologue,Induction and Tragedy\u2014is to be performed by the students of Harvard University at some time in the near future. Meanwhile, the perusal of the beautiful play will<br />\nwell repay all readers.<br /><br />\nFOOTBALL<br />\nThis year has seen a marked change in the<br />\nfootball policy at the University.

The desire is to<br />\nhave a homogeneous eleven, where each<br />\nplayer is familiar with his neighbor's style of<br />\nplay, and where team play, and not individual<br />\nplay, is paramount. To accomplish this end<br />\nit is absolutely essential that every undergraduate make some effort to help the team. This<br />\ncan be done in two ways\u2014first, by becoming<br />\na candidate for the team; second, by buying<br />\na season ticket, attending every game and<br />\njoining in the rooting.<br />\nThere is a splendid' opportunity for every<br />\nundergrad this year.

I never used to care for him<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nmuch, but lately he has, as it were, fascinated<br />\nme. Those ballads of his are marvelous,\"The<br />\nWhite Ship\" and \"The King's Tragedy,\"<br />\nespecially.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014I can't say I am very fond of<br />\nRossetti's ballads. In my poor opinion they<br />\nare often tedious, as, for instance, \"Dante at<br />\nVerona,\" and then Rossetti, with all his skill<br />\nin devising a refrain, was apt to provoke parody too easily\u2014Miss Carolyn Wells' \"Bacon<br />\nand Eggs and a Bar o' Soap,\" or Calverly's<br />\nsimilar refrain are too pain fully near those of<br />\n\"Helen's Bower\" and \"Lilith.\" The grandeur<br />\nof such ballads as \"The King's Tragedy\" is,<br />\nhowever, not marred by any such artificialities. They, I admit, are fine, though none are<br />\nequal to a poem written in Tennyson's extreme<br />\nyouth\u2014the incomparable \"Ballad of Ariana,\"<br />\nwhich, by the way, is an example of the poem<br />\nwith a refrain of beauty and simplicity. It is<br />\na monument to Tennyson's genius that at 23<br />\nhe should have written a ballad which remains<br />\nunequaled by any similar work of the preRaphaelites, though that field of poetry was<br />\npeculiarly theirs.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014But I have very often heard<br />\nyou speak of Rossetti as one of your favorite<br />\npoets, yet you seem quite down on him today.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014He is one of my favorite poets<br />\nbecause he is the author of two poems, \"The<br />\n\"Portrait\" and \"The Blessed Damozel.\" I<br />\nreally cannot make up my mind which is the<br />\nfiner, but I suppose the palm must go to \"The<br />\nBlessed Damozel.\" It is certainly his most<br />\nwidely known poem.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Do you believe it true that<br />\nRossetti wrote it as a sequel to \"The Raven\"?<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Not so much a sequel as a kind<br />\nof complimentary poem. Poe pictured the<br />\nnever-ending desolation of the lover on earth<br />\nRossetti, the \u2022 sadness of the beloved one in<br />\nheaven\u2014sadness intermingled with a holy<br />\nhope.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014It's almost a pity he attempted<br />\nto rival such a poem.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Do you think so? I honestly<br />\nthink \"The Raven\" nothing more than a tour<br />\nde force\u2014not to be compared in beauty to<br />\nseveral other poems of Poe, particularly \"The<br />\nHaunted Palace,\" \"To Helen\" and one or two<br />\nothers. It may be rank heresy, but I think<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"The Blessed Damozel\" is far finer.<br />\nbeauty of such lines as<br />\n\"But whose velvet, violet lining with the lamplight floating o'er,<br />\nShe shall pass, ah, nevermore!\"<br />\nThe Critic\u2014But aren't they, after all, mere<br />\ntricks of alteration? They aren't as barefaced as those of Swinburne, and are more<br />\nstriking than his, because the ear is not o'erburdened with a flow of sound, but there are<br />\nlines in Rossetti's poem as far superior to<br />\n\"The Raven\" as Poe's work is to that of the<br />\ncrowd of poeticules whom he hated and scorned. Just get me down that Rosetti\u2014on the shelf<br />\nby the door\u2014that's it. Let me read you a few<br />\nlines. Mr. Swinburne praised many of them<br />\nlong ago in his essay\u2014a magnificent piece of<br />\nEnglish which you *ought to read\u2014and Mr.<br />\nStedman, in his \"Victorian Poets,\" has called<br />\nattention to some. I'm not sure whether he<br />\ngives special mention to these:<br />\n\"She spoke through the still weather;<br />\nHer voice was like the voice the stars<br />\nHad when they sang together.\"<br />\nSurely, her voice was not unlike the words<br />\nused to describe it.<br />\nOr the steadfast dignity of such lines as:<br />\n\"The light thrilled towards her, filled<br />\nWith angels in strong, level flight.\"<br />\nAnd you, dear boy, with your imagination,<br />\nmust almost hear the loving wistfulness with<br />\nwhich she says:<br />\n\"When round his head the aureole clings.\"<br />\nAnd then the imagination of it! How exquisite is the artistry of the poet who could so<br />\nconnect the ideas of earth and heaven that<br />\nthe \"gold bar of heaven\" was made warm by<br />\nan immortal yet human bosom. Notice, too,<br />\nthe awfulness of heaven, suggested by the fact<br />\nthat the \"wonder was not yet quite gone\"<br />\nfrom her face, albeit she had been there ten<br />\nyears.<br />\nI said awhile ago that \"The Portrait\" was<br />\nalso a favorite poem of mine. In it Rossetti<br />\nforgets or discards his mannerisms to a great<br />\nextent, and appears more as a follower of<br />\nTennyson than in any other poem. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. W. M. Rossetti<br />\nhas stated that there is no real foundation for<br />\nthis poem, I sometimes feel as if it must have<br />\nbeen inspired by an actual loss. I have often<br />\nseen in my mind's eye the poet seated in that<br /><br />\ndark room in Cheyney Walk, with the deadly<br />\nchloral bottle near by. In his hands is a canvas, unframed, and on the rude stuff is painted<br />\none of his early glorious heads. He sits there<br />\nsilently, alone.<br />\n\"I gaze until she seems to stir,<br />\nUntil mine eyes almost aver<br />\nThat now, even now, the sweet lips part<br />\nTo breathe the words of the sweet heart\u2014<br />\nAnd yet the earth is over her.<br />\nI feel that \"the spring water\" and the \"dull<br />\nraindrops,\" and the \"talk and long, sweet<br />\nsilences\" must be part of a sad, true tale.<br />\nI have said that the poem is not unlike Tennyson in style. Two lines in particular are in<br />\nthe finest spirit of such poems as \"Ulysses.\"<br />\nThey are:<br />\n\"Upon the desolate verge of light<br />\nYearned loud the iron-bounded sea.\"<br />\nThey are almost equal to:<br />\n\"The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;<br />\nThe long day wanes; the slow moon climbs;<br />\nthe deep<br />\nMoans round with many voices.\"<br />\nThe Reader\u2014How superb that is! I have<br />\noften wondered why the school founded by<br />\nRossetti and Morris has had no continuation<br />\nin this generation.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014The reason is, I believe, that<br />\nthe two poets were apart from the interests of<br />\ntheir time, and nothing in art that is not in<br />\nsympathy with the thought and feeling of the<br />\nage can hope to have more than a fleeting<br />\nexistence. Again, any such movement as<br />\ntheirs is almost certain to degenerate into a<br />\nfad. Gautier was sincere in his plea for \"Art<br />\nfor Art's Sake ;\" the pre-Raphaelites were sincere in their similar opinions. Gautier was<br />\nnot a \"crank\" even when he appeared in his<br />\nfamous green trousers. Oscar Wild, the<br />\n\"apostle of reform in dress,\" the decadent descendant of a zroup of men of real genius\u2014<br />\nhe and others like him are responsible for the<br />\ndisappearance from our literature of men of<br />\nRossetti's genius and Morris' taste. \"Neo<br />\nRomanticism,\" and \"Pre-Raphaelitism,\" and<br />\n\"The English Renaissance\"\u2014they all became<br />\npart of a fad. The sooner Wilde and his kind<br />\nare forgotten the better for our literature.<br />\nIt is not to that sickly apostle of Wilde, that<br />\nmorbid young New Yorker, George Sylvester<br />\nWhat's-His-Name, whom we must look for the<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncontinuationof the traditions and glories of our<br />\nliterature. Rather is it towards young, enthusiastic Alfred Noyes, the singer of \"Sherwood<br />\nin the Twilight\" and of \"View in Lilac Time.\"<br />\nSpeaking of followers and disciples of<br />\npoets, it is a fact of some interest that William Watson receives bare mention from Stedman as \"a disciple of Morris, and a good one.\"<br />\nMr. Stedman, of course, could only judge by<br />\n\"The Prince's Quest,\" and such early powerless work. But to us, who have read the work<br />\nof. the \"Virgilian poet's\" maturity, and particularly his stern and yet brilliant elegic<br />\npoems, it seems strang, indeed, that he should<br />\nhave ever been classed with the wielder of gorgeous imagery, the worshiper of mere beauty,<br />\nthe \"idle singer of an empty day,\" William<br />\nMorris.<br />\nWatson's work is, I believe, bound to live.<br />\nHe is, as someone has said, \"as promising a<br />\ncandidate for poetic length of days as this age<br />\nhas to show.\" I mentioned but now his<br />\nmemorial poems. Let me find my favorite of<br />\nhis verses. Let me see\u2014let me see\u2014here it is.<br />\n\"A Child's Hair.\" His mastery of Bruns' favorite meter is here and elsewhere perfect.<br />\nListen to this:<br />\n\"From such a frolic head t'was shorn, .<br />\n'Tis scarce five years since he was born;<br />\nNot sunlight scampering over corn<br />\nWere merrier thing.<br />\nA child? A fragment of the morn;<br />\nA piece of spring.<br />\nHere, too, is another example of the same<br />\nstanzaic form from the lines on Matthew Arnold:<br />\n\"Great is the facile conqueror;<br />\nYet haply he who, wounded sore,<br />\nBreathless, unhorsed, all covered o'er<br />\nWith blood and sweat,<br />\nSinks foiled, but fighting evermore,<br />\nIs greater yet.\"<br />\nThis is not only noble verse; it is noble<br />\ntruth.<br /><br />\nSTUDIO<br />\nILGENFRITZ<br />\nto cumuiris<br />\nSuccessor<br /><br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n20 West Lexington Street<br />\nSpecial Discount to Students<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE<br /><br />\nNOVELTIES<br /><br />\nCharles Bonner<br />\n568 WEST FRANKLIN STREET<br /><br />\nCARL C.
