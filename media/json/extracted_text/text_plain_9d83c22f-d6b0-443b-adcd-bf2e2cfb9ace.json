Yet the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, which has a considerable Jewish population, does not<br />\nrecognize this occasion.<br />\nThere are, perhaps, a number of reasons<br />\nfor this exclusion. The University<br />\npresumably wishes to maintain a nonsectarian policy. The fact remains, however,<br />\nthat a number of Jewish students and faculty<br />\nmembers observe the holiday, and are being indirectly penalized for their faith.<br />\nStudents miss classes to attend services; they<br />\nmust then borrow notes and make up work<br />\nmissed.

Walker and<br />\nRichard Leakey decided to go<br />\nback to the original site in order<br />\nto recover missing parts of a<br />\nskeleton that was discovered<br />\nthree decades ago. \"We found<br />\nmore important parts of the<br />\nsame skeleton, and the fossil<br />\ndeposit itself was in a vertical<br />\npipe of rock which extended<br />\nthrough hard, barren sediments,\" Walker said.<br />\nIn other explorations, the<br />\nLeakeys had dug about one<br />\nmeter down into the deposit,<br />\nbut because of physical limitations, could go not farther.<br />\nAfter digging three meters into<br />\nthe trench, Walker, Leakey,<br />\nand Teaford could not yet<br />\ndetect an end to the deposit.<br />\nThe only explanations for how<br />\nsuch a deep and narrow deposit<br />\ncould have formed are that it<br />\nwas a tree trunk in which the<br />\nbones were preserved, or that it<br />\nwas a river pothole in which the<br />\nskeletal fragments collected.<br />\nThe latter explanation seems<br />\nunlikely, since river pot holes<br />\nare rarely this narrow and deep.<br />\nA week before the scientists'<br />\nintended departure, a heavy<br />\nrainstorm flooded the exploration site and prevented further<br />\ndigging.

We<br />\nthought you might enjoy<br />\nreading about what potential<br />\nexists for a Hopkins alumnus.<br />\nby Richard Waring<br />\nIt was 2:35 p.m. Wednesday<br />\nand the students in Levering<br />\nHall were watching the final<br />\nplayoff game between the Mets<br />\nand the Reds when NBC broke<br />\nin with the news that Vice President Agnew had resigned.<br />\nThe group broke out in<br />\ncheers and applause. Student<br />\nCouncil President Andrew W.<br />\nSavitz and Student Union<br />\nDirector Alan L. Sapakie slapped hands. Spiro T. Agnew,<br />\nmember of the Hopkins class of<br />\n1940, had just become a private<br />\ncitizen and a convicted felon.<br />\nAgnew's political career was<br />\napparently over and the campus<br />\nwhere he spent four semesters<br />\nas an undergraduate between<br />\n1936 and 1939 did not seem to<br />\nbe sorry.<br />\nThe former Vice President, a<br />\n<br />\nnative Baltimorean, had started<br />\nout at Hopkins in the second<br />\nsemester of 1936-37 as a<br />\nchemistry major. He went to<br />\nsummer classes here in 1937,<br />\nwas enrolled for the entire<br />\nacademic year of 1937-38, went<br />\nto another summer session and<br />\ndropped out after the fall<br />\nsemester of 1938 but never<br />\nreceived a degree from<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBy his own admission, he<br />\nnever worked very hard while a<br />\nstudent here and finally decided to give up the academic<br />\nroutine. According to Hopkins<br />\npersonnel who were employed<br />\nhere then, Agnew never made<br />\nmuch of an impression during<br />\nhis brief undergraduate career.<br />\n\"He just went right through<br />\nhere and no one ever knew<br />\nhim,\" remembered Dr. G.<br />\nWilson Shaffer, Psychology,<br />\nformer Dean of the Homewood<br />\nSchools. Shaffer was director<br />\nof sports during the Agnew<br />\nyears here, and would likely<br />\nhave encountered him if he had<br />\nparticipated in athletics.<br />\nIrene Davis Corwin who was<br />\nregistrar during the Agnew<br />\nyears here, said, \"He didn't<br />\n<br />\nstand out at all in my experience.\" Mrs. Corwin, now<br />\nretired, came in contact with<br />\nmany students during her years<br />\nhere, when the Hopkins student<br />\nbody was far smaller than it is<br />\ntoday. In the late 1930's, there<br />\nwere only about 1,000<br />\nundergraduates enrolled. Most<br />\nwere from Maryland.<br />\n\"There were a lot of city<br />\nboys here in those days who<br />\ncame and went and had their<br />\nfriends at home. If they were<br />\nmiddle-ground people, they<br />\nwere often not very well<br />\nknown,\" Mrs. Crowin remarked. She said her husband, Dr.<br />\nAlsoph Corwin, a retired<br />\nchemistry professor, never had<br />\nAgnew in any of his classes.<br />\nAfter he left Hopkins,<br />\nAgnew took a job with the<br />\nMaryland Casualty Co. and<br />\nenrolled in night law classes at<br />\nthe University of Baltimore.<br />\nOne of his classmates there,<br />\nHugh Higgins, still a Baltimore<br />\nresident, said he remembers<br />\nAgnew very well.<br />\n\"He had a lot of friends and<br />\nwas very well liked. He was just<br />\nas imposing then as now,\" Higgins said.<br />\n<br />\nOther than reading the book,<br />\nthough, which hardly takes any<br />\ntime at all(138 pp.), there is no<br />\nneed to make room in a<br />\nschedule for imitementation of<br />\nthe program, nest of it is done<br />\nin the mind, anyway. It's really a restructuring of one's<br />\nthinking in order to eliminate<br />\nfear and stress, and allow one<br />\nto take control.<br />\nThe only drawback is the<br />\nprice. $12.95 is not inexpensive,<br />\nbut if the program can help<br />\nstraighten out thoughts or help<br />\neliminate undue fear, it may be<br />\nworth it. So many times books<br />\nof this sort are purchased and<br />\ndo nothing but collect dust.<br />\nThey become part of one's<br />\nshelf-full of good intentions.

And, as chance would have<br />\nit, that was the exact amount my family had amassed<br />\nfor my college education. Nowadays it would be called \"a concatenous concentration of capital resources<br />\nand a transportation.\"<br />\nIf you're curious as to where we got that little gem,<br />\ntry last Saturday night's bash kicking off The Campaign for Johns Hopkins. With 1100 alumni and guests<br />\nof the University on campus for the gala reception and<br />\ndinner, it was easily one of the biggest single-day events<br />\nto hit Homewood in a long time.<br />\n000<br />\n<br />\nOverseeing the dinner program was Master of<br />\nCeremonies Steve Allen. Among other things, Allen<br />\nrecreated the \"man in the street\" interviews that were<br />\nso popular on his early TV shows, quizzing almost all<br />\nthe celebrities present.. Baker, of course, was among<br />\nhis victims.<br />\nBut Baker was hardly the only big name at the dinner. Among other luminaries present were Mayor<br />\nWilliam Donald Schaefer, Sugar Ray Leonard, R.<br />\nSeargent and Eunice Shriver, Senator Paul Sarbanes<br />\nand Congresswoman Barbara Mikulski.<br />\nThe idea of the whole thing was to launch the fiveyear, $450-million campaign in grand style. After a<br />\nreception in the lower quad, the guests moved to a second huge tent in the Gilman quad for dinner. Along<br />\nwith the Allen interviews with the likes of Baker and<br />\nLeonard, the guests also heard brief speeches from<br />\nCampaign Chairman Morris Offit, Hospital President<br />\nRobert Heyssel and University President Steven<br />\nMuller. The evening ended with a ten-minute multimedia show, featuring, among other things, a student<br />\nchoir and a laser show.<br />\nThe show wasn't the only impressive thing. Campaign Chairman Morris Offit announced that advance<br />\ngifts to the campaign totalled more than $114 millionmore than a quarter of the entire campaign's goal.<br />\nAnd no one seemed to be short of optimism that<br />\nthe remaining amount would be raised. Asked if<br />\nHopkins has a realistic shot at raising the whole $450<br />\nmillion, for example, Schaefer replied with<br />\ncharacteristic certainty.<br />\n\"If it had been just anyone, I wouldn't say so,\" the<br />\nmayor began. \"But when you have someone like<br />\nSteven Muller, and people in Baltimore who know how<br />\ngreat Baltimore is and how great Johns Hopkins is,<br />\nyeah, they can do it. We're gonna do it.\"<br />\nWhen asked a similar question, Muller also showed no doubts, \"Absolutely (the money can be raised).<br />\nIf we can raise $114 million in one year, we can certainly raise $450 million in five.\"<br />\nThat up-beat attitude seemed to permeate the whole<br />\nevening, beginning when the guests first arrived at 6:30<br />\n<br />\nlife,\" Leonard told Allen. \"My experience at Johns<br />\nHopkins was a special one...there are millions and<br />\nmillions of people who live every day with the fear of<br />\nlosing their eyesight.\"<br />\nBy far the most popular of these \"man in the street\"<br />\ninterviews was with Baker.<br />\n\"Well it was terrible,\" Baker said when asked by<br />\nAllen what it was like to go to Hopkins. \"The professors put brutal demands on you\u2014they expected you<br />\nto think.<br />\nBaker added that \"after three weeks in Physics I was<br />\nsix months behind the rest of the class ,\" causing the<br />\nprofessor to tell Baker that \"with your ability to be<br />\nwrong about everything, you should go into<br />\njournalism.\"<br />\nThe highlight of the evening was the announcement<br />\nby Offit that, even though the campaign is technically just beginning, the University has already raised<br />\nmore than a quarter of the $450 million goal. Offit,<br />\nin a speech during the dinner program, revealed that<br />\nadvance gifts to the campaign total 114 million dollars.<br />\nHe said this breaks down into 46 million dollars in<br />\n\"cash, securities and instrumentation gifts already in<br />\nhand,\" 57 million in term pledges and 11 million in<br />\nSteve Allen<br />\nbequest intentions. Offit said the 114 million amount<br />\nis a \"good firm number.\"<br />\nfor cocktails.<br />\nThis advance gift total includes a $5 million gift<br />\nAt about 7:15, once all the guests had arrived and from Harvey M. and Lenore P. Meyerhoff,<br />\nbeen checked in, trumpet fanfares from the upper $1.25 million of which will go to endow a chair in<br />\nquad beckoned them to the second tent for the dinner Biblical and Ancient Near Eastern Studies. In a stateprogram.<br />\nment, Offit said that fifteen other professorships have<br />\nRecreating the \"man in the street\" interviews, Allen been endowed by advance gifts.<br />\nquestioned several of the celebrities present from the<br />\n\"Our trustees have shown magnificient commitment<br />\nstage. As each person spoke, he apeared on the three both in time and in dollars,\" Offit said. \"Our adgiant, almost theater-sized, screens behind the stage, ministration, our academic deans and our department<br />\nmaking the exchange more than life-size for the<br />\naudience.<br />\nNoting that Esquire magazine recently called<br />\nSchaefer \"the best mayor in America,\" (the article,<br />\nby the way, was written by a Hopkins alum), Allen<br />\nbegan with Hizzoner, who as usual began by plugging good ole' Bawlmer.<br />\n\"I don't mind telling you you're in the greatest city<br />\nin the United States,\" Schaefer began, \"a place called Baltimore, Maryland.\"<br />\nSchaefer went on to praise Hopkins itself: \"Hopkins<br />\nhas meant so much to the city of Baltimore. Long<br />\nbefore it was known as the Renaissance City,<br />\nBaltimore was known because of Johns Hopkins...no<br />\nplace other than Johns Hopkins could have done this,<br />\nand no other city in the U.S. could say,'We are going<br />\nto raise 450 million dollars.\"<br />\nAlso interviewed was Mr. Shriver, who was George<br />\nMcGovern's running mate in 1972, and whose wife is<br />\nthe sister of Senator Edward Kennedy, and also the<br />\nExecutive Vice President of the Joseph P. Kennedy,<br />\nJr. Foundation. Shriver noted that the Kennedy Foundation was \"established as one of the first national<br />\ncenters for the mentally retarded nearly 20 years ago.\"<br />\nHe also noted that he and his wife are heavily involved with the Community of Caring\u2014an organization<br />\nwhich helps pregnant teenagers.<br />\nIn his interview with Allen, Leonard noted that his<br />\nassociation with Hopkins began when he first had<br />\ntrouble with his left eye.

This is a punk band in<br />\n'spirit only; these guys know<br />\nhow to play.<br />\nIndeed, if there is still such a<br />\nthing as \"progressive rock,\"<br />\nthe Minutemen (along with<br />\nsome of their cronies over at<br />\nSST, e.g. Husker Du) would<br />\nhave to be regarded as being the<br />\ncutting edge. Their music is impossible to categorize--at times<br />\nfunky, at others countrywestern-like, yet never strictly<br />\nFunk or C-W. It's wrong even<br />\nto put the \"rock 'n' roll\" label<br />\non them. Case in point: they<br />\ncover a Van Haien song on this<br />\nalbum (\"Ain't Talkin' About<br />\nLove\") and actually make it<br />\nsound good, precisely because<br />\nthey strip it free from all the old<br />\nrock cliches. This is no straight<br />\n4/4-time rock band.

All right, it<br />\nis a double album, but that's<br />\nstill pretty impressive. The<br />\nminute song is a Minutemen<br />\ntrademark. The band, from its<br />\n<br />\nvery beginning, has embraced<br />\nthe concept of fragmentation<br />\n(much like Wire c. Pink Flag);<br />\nthe songs are never complete in<br />\na traditional sense. They break<br />\nall the rules of traditional song<br />\nstructure: there are clear-cut<br />\nchoruses and verses only occasionally, and the lyrics are very<br />\nrarely repeated. Thus, a<br />\nMinutemen song is precise and<br />\nto the point; there's very little<br />\nexcess. They don't waste any of<br />\n<br />\ntheir(or our)valuable time just<br />\nto comply with tradition. \"We<br />\nstrip our tunes/we jam econo,\"<br />\nthey sing on \"The Politics of<br />\nTime.\"<br />\nThe lyrics are generally as<br />\nprecise(and fragmentary)as the<br />\nmusic.

Thus, with plenty of<br />\ntime remaining (nearly the<br />\nwhole fourth quarter), the score<br />\nread 34-21.<br />\nThat was as close as Lebanon<br />\n<br />\nValley got, as Pfeifer reinserted<br />\nthe starters on offense, and the<br />\ndefense began to tighten up.<br />\nCampbell engineered one last<br />\nscoring drive, a seven-play, 70<br />\nyard march culminating in an<br />\n8-yard pass to Verica for his second TD of the game.

Since last<br />\nThursday, Anderson has seen<br />\nonly one goal in three games,<br />\nand that one was scored by<br />\nGeorgetown.<br />\nThe scoring drought has<br />\nlowered the team's record to<br />\n3-2-2, and 0-0-1 in conference<br />\nplay, the most recent result being Tuesday's scoreless tie<br />\nagainst Goucher. Last Saturday, a confident Georgetown<br />\nteam handed the Jays their first<br />\nregular season defeat, 1-0.<br />\nThe Jays are not playing<br />\npoorly, according to Anderson;<br />\nthey have just been unable to<br />\nput the ball past the goalie.<br />\n\"Our biggest problem is supporting the ball offensively,\"<br />\nsaid the coach. \"We haven't<br />\nbeen able to maintain our<br />\nmomentum on offense.\"<br />\nAgainst Georgetown, for example, the Jays recorded only 8<br />\nshots-on-goal to the Hoyas' 17.<br />\nDefensively, the team's<br />\nstatistics have remained impressive. In the seven games<br />\nplayed this season, goalie Amy<br />\nZimmerman has allowed only<br />\nfour goals. One extra goal in<br />\nany game, therefore, could<br />\nmake the difference between a<br />\ntie and a win. Unfortunately,<br />\nthe Jays are learning this fact<br />\nthe hard way.<br />\nSaturday's match on<br />\nHomewood Field pitted the<br />\nJays against the Division I<br />\nHoyas, who had beaten them<br />\non two previous occasions, the<br />\nlatter by a 1-0 score. The<br />\nHoyas, used to playing on the<br />\nAstro-Turf, took away some of<br />\nHopkins' home-field advantage<br />\nwith crisp passing and strong<br />\ndefensive play. \"They had bet-<br />\n<br />\nter sticks,\" admitted co-captain<br />\nJudy Schmidt, \"and they could<br />\ntighten their defense when they<br />\nneeded to.\" Many of the Jays<br />\noffensive spurts were cut short<br />\nby the well-organized Georgetown defense, resulting in few<br />\nshooting opportunities.<br />\nHopkins managed to gain<br />\nonly 2 penalty corners in the entire game, while Georgetown<br />\namassed 12. At the six-minute<br />\nmark in the second half,<br />\nHoyas' forward Beth Anderson<br />\nmade use of one of these opportunities by scoring a goal off<br />\na deflection from Marianne<br />\nSullivan. \"We're fouling a little too often,\" said freshman<br />\nback Jennifer Stahl, \"but their<br />\noffense was rushing very well.\"<br />\nAnderson praised the Hopkins defense, singling out<br />\nfreshman sweeper Lynn<br />\nChristensen for \"steady and<br />\nreliable defense,\" and Zimmerman for her aggressive goaltending (12 saves). \"Our backs are<br />\nvery young,\" said the coach.<br />\n\"They knew that Georgetown's<br />\nshooting would be tough, but<br />\nthey were able to get together<br />\nand hold them off.\"<br />\nTo improve their control on<br />\nthe turf, Anderson has been<br />\nhaving the women work on<br />\nlong crossfield passes, but<br />\nmuch of the improvement that<br />\nis needed cannot be made in<br />\npractice. \"We've lacked intensity and leadership on the field,<br />\nand that's part of the reason<br />\nthat the offense couldn't get<br />\norganized,\"<br />\nshe<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"Somebody still needs to take<br />\ncommand on offense.\"<br />\nSome of that needed intensity was seen near the end of the<br />\nGeorgetown game, when time<br />\nwas running out and the Jays<br />\nwere pressuring offensively. \"If<br />\nwe could have played the whole<br />\ngame like the last five minutes,<br />\nwe might have done better,\"<br />\nsaid<br />\nco-captain<br />\nKaren<br />\nMcGuire.

Facing two<br />\ntough opponents, Georgetown<br />\nand UMBC,the Jays were able<br />\nto come away with a scoreless<br />\ntie against the Retrievers,<br />\nHopkins lost to Georgetown<br />\nlast Saturday, 2-0.\"We played<br />\na great first half, then Rob Nardino (a starting halfback) was<br />\nhurt. It shook us up for a while<br />\nand we were confused in the second half,\" said Coach<br />\nWilliam Tierney. The Hopkins<br />\ndefense has only allowed three<br />\ngoals this season and two of<br />\n<br />\nthem came in the second half of<br />\nthis game.<br />\n\"We made a couple of<br />\nmistakes. They took advantage<br />\nof them and scored,\" the coach<br />\nexplained.<br />\nThis contest marked the first<br />\ntime in the 1984 season that the<br />\nopposing team outshot JHU.<br />\nThe Hoyas recorded 10 shotson-goal and four saves while<br />\nHopkins had seven shots-ongoal with goalie Ray Giuriceo<br />\ngaining six saves.<br />\nThe Jays played UMBC to a<br />\ndouble-overtime scoreless tie<br />\nTuesday night at Homewood.<br />\nThe booters could not win,<br />\ndespite the fact that \"we totally outplayed them,\" according<br />\nto Tierney.<br />\n<br />\nGoalie Ray Giuriceo<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jays also played to<br />\na double-overtime scoreless tie<br />\nwith Catholic University earlier<br />\nthis season. The UMBC game,<br />\nhowever, was a \"completely<br />\ndifferent game. It was very well<br />\nplayed. We did everything correctly. The defense played well,<br />\nthe midfield played well and the<br />\nforwards played well. We just<br />\ndidn't score,\" Tierney said.<br />\nTierney cited several players<br />\nfor outstanding performances.<br />\n\"Grenville Jones played a great<br />\ngame,\" the coach said. \"He<br />\ncame really close to scoring but<br />\na UMBC fullback came from<br />\nout of nowhere and saved the<br />\nshot.<br />\n\"The whole defense did a<br />\ngreat job, especially Dave<br />\nPlaut, Sherif Siragelden and<br />\nfreshman Stanton Golding,\"<br />\nsaid Tierney. He also praised<br />\nthe play of sophomore Kris<br />\nNiyogi, saying \"he played<br />\nagainst their best guy and effectively took him out of the<br />\ngame. He did a fantastic job.\"<br />\nCaptain Plaut also spoke<br />\nhighly of the Hopkins<br />\nsophomore. \"Niyogi was<br />\noutstanding.

Golding and Siragelden<br />\nplayed consistently well too,\"<br />\nPlaut said.<br />\nGame statistics reflected<br />\nHopkins' domination on the<br />\nfield. The Jay offense racked<br />\nup nine shots-on-goal while the<br />\nRetrievers managed only one.<br />\nGoaltender Giuriceo was forced to make only one save.<br />\nJunior fullback Paul Miller<br />\npraised the play of the Hopkins<br />\ndefense, saying, \"our defense<br />\nwas tougher to get through than<br />\nthe Iron Curtain.\"<br />\n\"The defense is really playing as a unit now.

It was a bit of a<br />\nletdown for us to put so much<br />\npressure on them and not get a<br />\ngoal. We have confidence in<br />\nevery other part of our game.<br />\nWe just need a few goals to get<br />\nour offense on track.\"<br />\nCaptain Plaut is confident<br />\nthat the Jays will score their<br />\nshare of goals. \"There hasn't<br />\n<br />\nbeen a team that we couldn't<br />\nhave beaten (Hopkins is 1-2-2).<br />\nIt's been frustrating,\" Plaut<br />\nsaid. \"It's not that we don't<br />\nhave any offensive potential\u2014<br />\nwe've been knocking on the<br />\ndoor.

This holiday is one of the most significant events on the Jewish calendar. Yet the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, which has a considerable Jewish population, does not<br />\nrecognize this occasion.<br />\nThere are, perhaps, a number of reasons<br />\nfor this exclusion. The University<br />\npresumably wishes to maintain a nonsectarian policy. The fact remains, however,<br />\nthat a number of Jewish students and faculty<br />\nmembers observe the holiday, and are being indirectly penalized for their faith.<br />\nStudents miss classes to attend services; they<br />\nmust then borrow notes and make up work<br />\nmissed. Professors cancel classes, depriving<br />\nthemselves and their students of valuable<br />\nclass time. Thus, both Jewish and nonJewish students must suffer.<br />\nWhat is most striking, though, is that the<br />\nentire situation is unfair. Christmas and<br /><br />\nThe Hop Works<br />\nLast Spring, the Hopkins Organization for<br />\nProgramming, or the \"Hop,\" was conceptualized by a group of individuals interested<br />\nin improving social activities for students.<br />\nTheir major concern was to \"expand the<br />\nscope of events on campus.\"<br />\nAfter several hours of work during the<br />\nsummer, the nine-member board was able<br />\nto devise an arrangement in which the Hop<br />\nitself would present social events in addition<br />\nto providing assistance to other groups. A<br />\nletter of introduction was sent to all<br />\nundergraduates oulining strategies to achieve<br />\nthese goals.<br />\nIn typical Hopkins fashion, however,<br />\nmany students were unconvinced of the impact that the Hop would have on an admittedly lean social life. The News-Letter was<br />\nlikewise skeptical.<br />\nNevertheless, the students and administrators directly involved with the Hop<br /><br />\nattains the organizational objectives set for<br />\nthis year, it deserves the full support of the<br />\nstudents; they are, after all, the ones who will<br />\nbenefit.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nSouth Africa<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThroughout the past month<br />\nthere has been a large increase<br />\nin the amount of coverage given<br />\nto events that occur in South<br />\nAfrica. For example, The Sun<br />\nhad articles on South Africa<br />\nalmost every day of last week.<br />\nThis month at least 55 people<br />\nhave been killed and hundreds<br />\ninjured in clashes with the<br />\npolice(NY Times, 24 Sept. 84,<br />\nA3). Just this weekend over 600<br />\nblack people were arrested for<br />\n\"attending illegal meetings.\"<br />\nThese events occur not without<br />\nreason, and to understand<br />\nthose reasons some basic facts<br />\nabout South Africa must be<br /><br />\nby Michael Milauskas<br /><br />\nknown.<br />\nSouth Africa is a country<br />\nstratified by various groups of<br />\npeople<br />\nfrom<br />\ndifferent<br />\nbackgrounds. There are six<br />\nbasic groups, listed in order of<br />\nrecognized political power,<br />\nwhich can be divided into those<br />\nwho are collectively known as<br />\n\"White\"(Afrikaners, who are<br />\nin control of the government),<br />\nEnglish-speakers<br />\nand<br />\n\"honorary Whites\"(which include the Chinese and the<br />\nJapanese), and \"Black\" (coloreds, Indians, and Africans).<br />\nThose classified as Black make<br />\nup 84 percent of the<br />\npopulation.<br />\nWhichever group that one<br />\nbelongs to determines the<br />\ncourse of his/her life. It deter-<br /><br />\nmines the people one may<br />\nassociate with, the schools that<br />\none can go to, the jobs that one<br />\nmay obtain, the places that one<br />\nmay be in, etc. The law applies<br />\ndifferently to different groups,<br />\nbut they always may be<br />\nviolated, without hope for<br />\nredress. When Gov't/Police<br />\nacts without regard to a person's<br />\nbackground is when it represses<br />\ndissent.<br />\nThe law proscribes such<br />\nthings as whom one may marry<br />\n(The Immorality Act), where<br />\none may live (Group Areas<br />\nAct), and anything else that one<br />\nmay say or do (Internal Security Act and Pass Laws). It convicts political \"offenders\" as<br />\nContinued on Page 7<br /><br />\nplacency, would argue to leave<br />\nthe yearbook as it stands.

Every<br />\ntradition starts somewhere.<br />\nWhy not begin our own? Tradition is also a very good defense<br />\nfor apathy.<br />\nAs for the News-Letter, its<br />\nname implies a small pamphlet<br />\nof information of interest to a<br />\nsmall number of people or a<br />\nspecial group. The News-Letter<br />\nfits the above definition, but it<br />\nis something more. It strives to<br />\nbe a quality organization/publication, but it will<br />\nalways be shackled by its<br />\nmoniker. It is a student-run<br />\nnewspaper of one of the most<br />\nprestigious universities in the<br />\nworld.

We<br />\nthought you might enjoy<br />\nreading about what potential<br />\nexists for a Hopkins alumnus.<br />\nby Richard Waring<br />\nIt was 2:35 p.m. Wednesday<br />\nand the students in Levering<br />\nHall were watching the final<br />\nplayoff game between the Mets<br />\nand the Reds when NBC broke<br />\nin with the news that Vice President Agnew had resigned.<br />\nThe group broke out in<br />\ncheers and applause. Student<br />\nCouncil President Andrew W.<br />\nSavitz and Student Union<br />\nDirector Alan L. Sapakie slapped hands. Spiro T. Agnew,<br />\nmember of the Hopkins class of<br />\n1940, had just become a private<br />\ncitizen and a convicted felon.<br />\nAgnew's political career was<br />\napparently over and the campus<br />\nwhere he spent four semesters<br />\nas an undergraduate between<br />\n1936 and 1939 did not seem to<br />\nbe sorry.<br />\nThe former Vice President, a<br /><br />\nnative Baltimorean, had started<br />\nout at Hopkins in the second<br />\nsemester of 1936-37 as a<br />\nchemistry major. He went to<br />\nsummer classes here in 1937,<br />\nwas enrolled for the entire<br />\nacademic year of 1937-38, went<br />\nto another summer session and<br />\ndropped out after the fall<br />\nsemester of 1938 but never<br />\nreceived a degree from<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBy his own admission, he<br />\nnever worked very hard while a<br />\nstudent here and finally decided to give up the academic<br />\nroutine. According to Hopkins<br />\npersonnel who were employed<br />\nhere then, Agnew never made<br />\nmuch of an impression during<br />\nhis brief undergraduate career.<br />\n\"He just went right through<br />\nhere and no one ever knew<br />\nhim,\" remembered Dr. G.<br />\nWilson Shaffer, Psychology,<br />\nformer Dean of the Homewood<br />\nSchools. Shaffer was director<br />\nof sports during the Agnew<br />\nyears here, and would likely<br />\nhave encountered him if he had<br />\nparticipated in athletics.<br />\nIrene Davis Corwin who was<br />\nregistrar during the Agnew<br />\nyears here, said, \"He didn't<br /><br />\nstand out at all in my experience.\" Mrs. Corwin, now<br />\nretired, came in contact with<br />\nmany students during her years<br />\nhere, when the Hopkins student<br />\nbody was far smaller than it is<br />\ntoday. In the late 1930's, there<br />\nwere only about 1,000<br />\nundergraduates enrolled. Most<br />\nwere from Maryland.<br />\n\"There were a lot of city<br />\nboys here in those days who<br />\ncame and went and had their<br />\nfriends at home. If they were<br />\nmiddle-ground people, they<br />\nwere often not very well<br />\nknown,\" Mrs. Crowin remarked. She said her husband, Dr.<br />\nAlsoph Corwin, a retired<br />\nchemistry professor, never had<br />\nAgnew in any of his classes.<br />\nAfter he left Hopkins,<br />\nAgnew took a job with the<br />\nMaryland Casualty Co. and<br />\nenrolled in night law classes at<br />\nthe University of Baltimore.<br />\nOne of his classmates there,<br />\nHugh Higgins, still a Baltimore<br />\nresident, said he remembers<br />\nAgnew very well.<br />\n\"He had a lot of friends and<br />\nwas very well liked. He was just<br />\nas imposing then as now,\" Higgins said.<br /><br />\nOther than reading the book,<br />\nthough, which hardly takes any<br />\ntime at all(138 pp.), there is no<br />\nneed to make room in a<br />\nschedule for imitementation of<br />\nthe program, nest of it is done<br />\nin the mind, anyway. It's really a restructuring of one's<br />\nthinking in order to eliminate<br />\nfear and stress, and allow one<br />\nto take control.<br />\nThe only drawback is the<br />\nprice. $12.95 is not inexpensive,<br />\nbut if the program can help<br />\nstraighten out thoughts or help<br />\neliminate undue fear, it may be<br />\nworth it. So many times books<br />\nof this sort are purchased and<br />\ndo nothing but collect dust.<br />\nThey become part of one's<br />\nshelf-full of good intentions. At<br />\nleast the reader will easily finish<br />\nthis one, but the initial spark<br />\nmust come from within.

And, as chance would have<br />\nit, that was the exact amount my family had amassed<br />\nfor my college education. Nowadays it would be called \"a concatenous concentration of capital resources<br />\nand a transportation.\"<br />\nIf you're curious as to where we got that little gem,<br />\ntry last Saturday night's bash kicking off The Campaign for Johns Hopkins. With 1100 alumni and guests<br />\nof the University on campus for the gala reception and<br />\ndinner, it was easily one of the biggest single-day events<br />\nto hit Homewood in a long time.<br />\n000<br /><br />\nOverseeing the dinner program was Master of<br />\nCeremonies Steve Allen. Among other things, Allen<br />\nrecreated the \"man in the street\" interviews that were<br />\nso popular on his early TV shows, quizzing almost all<br />\nthe celebrities present.. Baker, of course, was among<br />\nhis victims.<br />\nBut Baker was hardly the only big name at the dinner. Among other luminaries present were Mayor<br />\nWilliam Donald Schaefer, Sugar Ray Leonard, R.<br />\nSeargent and Eunice Shriver, Senator Paul Sarbanes<br />\nand Congresswoman Barbara Mikulski.<br />\nThe idea of the whole thing was to launch the fiveyear, $450-million campaign in grand style. After a<br />\nreception in the lower quad, the guests moved to a second huge tent in the Gilman quad for dinner. Along<br />\nwith the Allen interviews with the likes of Baker and<br />\nLeonard, the guests also heard brief speeches from<br />\nCampaign Chairman Morris Offit, Hospital President<br />\nRobert Heyssel and University President Steven<br />\nMuller. The evening ended with a ten-minute multimedia show, featuring, among other things, a student<br />\nchoir and a laser show.<br />\nThe show wasn't the only impressive thing. Campaign Chairman Morris Offit announced that advance<br />\ngifts to the campaign totalled more than $114 millionmore than a quarter of the entire campaign's goal.<br />\nAnd no one seemed to be short of optimism that<br />\nthe remaining amount would be raised. Asked if<br />\nHopkins has a realistic shot at raising the whole $450<br />\nmillion, for example, Schaefer replied with<br />\ncharacteristic certainty.<br />\n\"If it had been just anyone, I wouldn't say so,\" the<br />\nmayor began. \"But when you have someone like<br />\nSteven Muller, and people in Baltimore who know how<br />\ngreat Baltimore is and how great Johns Hopkins is,<br />\nyeah, they can do it. We're gonna do it.\"<br />\nWhen asked a similar question, Muller also showed no doubts, \"Absolutely (the money can be raised).<br />\nIf we can raise $114 million in one year, we can certainly raise $450 million in five.\"<br />\nThat up-beat attitude seemed to permeate the whole<br />\nevening, beginning when the guests first arrived at 6:30<br /><br />\nlife,\" Leonard told Allen. \"My experience at Johns<br />\nHopkins was a special one...there are millions and<br />\nmillions of people who live every day with the fear of<br />\nlosing their eyesight.\"<br />\nBy far the most popular of these \"man in the street\"<br />\ninterviews was with Baker.<br />\n\"Well it was terrible,\" Baker said when asked by<br />\nAllen what it was like to go to Hopkins. \"The professors put brutal demands on you\u2014they expected you<br />\nto think.<br />\nBaker added that \"after three weeks in Physics I was<br />\nsix months behind the rest of the class ,\" causing the<br />\nprofessor to tell Baker that \"with your ability to be<br />\nwrong about everything, you should go into<br />\njournalism.\"<br />\nThe highlight of the evening was the announcement<br />\nby Offit that, even though the campaign is technically just beginning, the University has already raised<br />\nmore than a quarter of the $450 million goal. Offit,<br />\nin a speech during the dinner program, revealed that<br />\nadvance gifts to the campaign total 114 million dollars.<br />\nHe said this breaks down into 46 million dollars in<br />\n\"cash, securities and instrumentation gifts already in<br />\nhand,\" 57 million in term pledges and 11 million in<br />\nSteve Allen<br />\nbequest intentions. Offit said the 114 million amount<br />\nis a \"good firm number.\"<br />\nfor cocktails.<br />\nThis advance gift total includes a $5 million gift<br />\nAt about 7:15, once all the guests had arrived and from Harvey M. and Lenore P.

Long<br />\nbefore it was known as the Renaissance City,<br />\nBaltimore was known because of Johns Hopkins...no<br />\nplace other than Johns Hopkins could have done this,<br />\nand no other city in the U.S. could say,'We are going<br />\nto raise 450 million dollars.\"<br />\nAlso interviewed was Mr. Shriver, who was George<br />\nMcGovern's running mate in 1972, and whose wife is<br />\nthe sister of Senator Edward Kennedy, and also the<br />\nExecutive Vice President of the Joseph P. Kennedy,<br />\nJr. Foundation. Shriver noted that the Kennedy Foundation was \"established as one of the first national<br />\ncenters for the mentally retarded nearly 20 years ago.\"<br />\nHe also noted that he and his wife are heavily involved with the Community of Caring\u2014an organization<br />\nwhich helps pregnant teenagers.<br />\nIn his interview with Allen, Leonard noted that his<br />\nassociation with Hopkins began when he first had<br />\ntrouble with his left eye. Eventually he came to the<br />\nWilmer Eye Center at the East Baltimore campus for<br />\nhis surgery.<br />\n\"I realized what I have taken for granted all my<br />\nRussell Baker<br /><br />\nheads are giving us tremendous leadership. Our<br />\ndevelopment office, public affairs office and alumni<br />\noffice are giving us tremendous support. All these people responsible for these very inspiring results.<br />\n\"We all have a special brand of enthusiasm,\" he<br />\ncontinued, \"that we bring to Johns Hopkins because<br />\nof our special brand of admiration and respect for this<br />\nspecial brand of excellence. This campaign is<br />\neveryone's campaign. The hallmarks of our success<br />\nwill be cohesiveness, vitality, participation, and most<br />\nof all, personal dignity.<br />\n\"We have the campaign organization to more than<br />\naccomplish our goal, certainly with this running start,<br />\nand five years from now we will all look back with<br />\na special pride in our accomplishment.\"<br />\nFollowing speeches by Offit and Hospital President<br />\nRobert Heyssel, University President Steven Muller<br />\nspoke, leading to the evening's climax\u2014a ten-minute<br />\nmulti-media show involving slides, taped interiews with<br />\nvarious Hopkins personalities, a choir of students and,<br />\nat the very end, a laser show.<br />\nMuller began his speech by saying that while the<br />\nnight was a \"fun evening,\" it was also a \"momentous<br />\nevening.\"<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022 Lasers, Lights and Muller to Music<br /><br />\n\"Tonight we share in common one commitment, ped away from the microphone.<br />\nSo, what did it take to put on this extravaganza?<br />\nand are united in a single purpose\u2014to serve these inMuller's speech led up to the finale, which centered Try dozens of undergraduate volunteers (all donning<br />\nstitutions that we so cherish and to lift them to new around taped interviews with people connected with special campaign sweatshirts), some to sing in a special<br />\nheights,\" he said.<br />\nHopkins, including Edward Albee, Denton Cooley, choir, some to just stand around and help people.

I saw the Minutemen<br />\nduring the summer and got a<br />\npreview of some of the songs,<br />\nbut it's hard to pay too much<br />\nattention when you're trying to<br />\nbodies.<br />\nflying<br />\navoid<br />\nNonetheless, they proved<br />\nthemselves to be much more<br />\nthan the hardcore band the<br />\ncrowd evidently thought they<br />\nwere. This is a punk band in<br />\n'spirit only; these guys know<br />\nhow to play.<br />\nIndeed, if there is still such a<br />\nthing as \"progressive rock,\"<br />\nthe Minutemen (along with<br />\nsome of their cronies over at<br />\nSST, e.g. Husker Du) would<br />\nhave to be regarded as being the<br />\ncutting edge. Their music is impossible to categorize--at times<br />\nfunky, at others countrywestern-like, yet never strictly<br />\nFunk or C-W. It's wrong even<br />\nto put the \"rock 'n' roll\" label<br />\non them. Case in point: they<br />\ncover a Van Haien song on this<br />\nalbum (\"Ain't Talkin' About<br />\nLove\") and actually make it<br />\nsound good, precisely because<br />\nthey strip it free from all the old<br />\nrock cliches. This is no straight<br />\n4/4-time rock band. My closest<br /><br />\nEcono' on Double Nickels<br /><br />\napproximation would be a cross<br />\nbetween the Grateful Dead and<br />\nthe Gang of Four. And you can<br />\ndiscount the Dead comparison<br />\nright off--Minutemen songs are<br />\nshort, 1:30-2:00 min. on<br />\naverage.<br />\nIn fact there are 45(!) songs<br />\non Double Nickels. All right, it<br />\nis a double album, but that's<br />\nstill pretty impressive. The<br />\nminute song is a Minutemen<br />\ntrademark. The band, from its<br /><br />\nvery beginning, has embraced<br />\nthe concept of fragmentation<br />\n(much like Wire c. Pink Flag);<br />\nthe songs are never complete in<br />\na traditional sense. They break<br />\nall the rules of traditional song<br />\nstructure: there are clear-cut<br />\nchoruses and verses only occasionally, and the lyrics are very<br />\nrarely repeated. Thus, a<br />\nMinutemen song is precise and<br />\nto the point; there's very little<br />\nexcess. They don't waste any of<br /><br />\ntheir(or our)valuable time just<br />\nto comply with tradition. \"We<br />\nstrip our tunes/we jam econo,\"<br />\nthey sing on \"The Politics of<br />\nTime.\"<br />\nThe lyrics are generally as<br />\nprecise(and fragmentary)as the<br />\nmusic. They use words instead<br />\nof statements, and statements<br />\ninstead of entire songs; like a<br />\ngood poem, you can catch the<br />\nmeaning of the song even if you<br />\nhaven't the faintest idea of<br /><br />\nwhat the words are supposed to<br />\nmean. The lyrics, written by<br />\nsinger-guitarist d.boon, are<br />\ngenerally more direct and<br />\npolitical than those written by<br />\nbassist Mike Watt, who writes<br />\nmost of the songs. Subject matter varies from outright politics<br />\nof\"Vietnam\" to the sanctity of<br />\nwords on \"Do you want New<br />\nWave or do you want the<br />\nTruth.\" Like a good punk<br />\nContinued on Page 16<br /><br />\nOxford Blues: A Movie for Masochists<br />\nby Katherine Katsidhe and Sue<br />\nFetterman<br />\nHe gets the cutie American<br />\ngirl.<br />\nThere.

Since last<br />\nThursday, Anderson has seen<br />\nonly one goal in three games,<br />\nand that one was scored by<br />\nGeorgetown.<br />\nThe scoring drought has<br />\nlowered the team's record to<br />\n3-2-2, and 0-0-1 in conference<br />\nplay, the most recent result being Tuesday's scoreless tie<br />\nagainst Goucher. Last Saturday, a confident Georgetown<br />\nteam handed the Jays their first<br />\nregular season defeat, 1-0.<br />\nThe Jays are not playing<br />\npoorly, according to Anderson;<br />\nthey have just been unable to<br />\nput the ball past the goalie.<br />\n\"Our biggest problem is supporting the ball offensively,\"<br />\nsaid the coach. \"We haven't<br />\nbeen able to maintain our<br />\nmomentum on offense.\"<br />\nAgainst Georgetown, for example, the Jays recorded only 8<br />\nshots-on-goal to the Hoyas' 17.<br />\nDefensively, the team's<br />\nstatistics have remained impressive. In the seven games<br />\nplayed this season, goalie Amy<br />\nZimmerman has allowed only<br />\nfour goals. One extra goal in<br />\nany game, therefore, could<br />\nmake the difference between a<br />\ntie and a win. Unfortunately,<br />\nthe Jays are learning this fact<br />\nthe hard way.<br />\nSaturday's match on<br />\nHomewood Field pitted the<br />\nJays against the Division I<br />\nHoyas, who had beaten them<br />\non two previous occasions, the<br />\nlatter by a 1-0 score. The<br />\nHoyas, used to playing on the<br />\nAstro-Turf, took away some of<br />\nHopkins' home-field advantage<br />\nwith crisp passing and strong<br />\ndefensive play. \"They had bet-<br /><br />\nter sticks,\" admitted co-captain<br />\nJudy Schmidt, \"and they could<br />\ntighten their defense when they<br />\nneeded to.\" Many of the Jays<br />\noffensive spurts were cut short<br />\nby the well-organized Georgetown defense, resulting in few<br />\nshooting opportunities.<br />\nHopkins managed to gain<br />\nonly 2 penalty corners in the entire game, while Georgetown<br />\namassed 12. At the six-minute<br />\nmark in the second half,<br />\nHoyas' forward Beth Anderson<br />\nmade use of one of these opportunities by scoring a goal off<br />\na deflection from Marianne<br />\nSullivan. \"We're fouling a little too often,\" said freshman<br />\nback Jennifer Stahl, \"but their<br />\noffense was rushing very well.\"<br />\nAnderson praised the Hopkins defense, singling out<br />\nfreshman sweeper Lynn<br />\nChristensen for \"steady and<br />\nreliable defense,\" and Zimmerman for her aggressive goaltending (12 saves). \"Our backs are<br />\nvery young,\" said the coach.<br />\n\"They knew that Georgetown's<br />\nshooting would be tough, but<br />\nthey were able to get together<br />\nand hold them off.\"<br />\nTo improve their control on<br />\nthe turf, Anderson has been<br />\nhaving the women work on<br />\nlong crossfield passes, but<br />\nmuch of the improvement that<br />\nis needed cannot be made in<br />\npractice. \"We've lacked intensity and leadership on the field,<br />\nand that's part of the reason<br />\nthat the offense couldn't get<br />\norganized,\"<br />\nshe<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"Somebody still needs to take<br />\ncommand on offense.\"<br />\nSome of that needed intensity was seen near the end of the<br />\nGeorgetown game, when time<br />\nwas running out and the Jays<br />\nwere pressuring offensively. \"If<br />\nwe could have played the whole<br />\ngame like the last five minutes,<br />\nwe might have done better,\"<br />\nsaid<br />\nco-captain<br />\nKaren<br />\nMcGuire.
