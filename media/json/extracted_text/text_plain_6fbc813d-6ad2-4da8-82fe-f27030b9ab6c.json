Thereupon the ruler<br />\nsummoned the best ivory sculptor<br />\nin the country and commissioned<br />\nhim to carve a Kuan Yin statue of<br />\nthe tusk of this elephant. For three<br />\nyears the artist worked continuously.<br />\nThe model for this figure was the<br />\npainting that was done by the greatest of all Chinese artists of the<br />\nT'ang dynasty, Wu Tao-Tze. He<br />\nwas the court painter for Emperor<br />\nMing Huang.

FUND DRIVE<br />\nEXCEEDS SET GOAL<br />\n<br />\nnight at the Lyric Theatre four leading minds expressed<br />\nLAST<br />\ndiversified views on their respective spiritual beliefs. Those who<br />\nwere present at the religious forum were undoubtedly swayed more<br />\nby the speaker who preached the doctrines which they themselves upheld. This is only natural. It stands to reason that a person will<br />\nsupport those things which were drilled into him since childhood by<br />\nthe various organs of his sect. However, gatherings such as last night's<br />\nat which the views' of intelligent men are brought fefore the public<br />\nin an unbiased light, tend to bring the visions of the prophets nearer<br />\nto reality. And yet, certain individuals are so constituted that they<br />\nbear contempt towards anyone who holds a religious belief which<br />\ndiffers from their own.<br />\nIt seems that the college man trends towards a general laxity as<br />\nfar as actual belief in a divine being is concerned. He admits that the<br />\nvarious religious sects have done a great deal of good in upholding the<br />\nmorals and promoting the welfare of the community. Strange to say,<br />\nthe uneducated man takes the teachings of the church verbatim and<br />\nbelieves he sees, hears and feels his God, while the educated man<br />\nsays, \"I don't know.\" This is a factor which religious leaders are<br />\ntrying to offset, and accounts in a way for the growing liberalizing<br />\ninfluence in religion.<br />\nThe college man should have definite religious beliefs. It seems<br />\nquite ignorant to say, \"I don't know.\" Such an answer is not sufficient.<br />\nMore attention should be given to the consideraiton of the problems<br />\nand philosophy of religion. The college man should, at least, be able<br />\nto discuss them with an intelligent and unprejudiced point of view.<br />\nS. L.<br />\n<br />\nRESERVE STRENGTH<br />\nthree successive years the Jays have bowed to St. John's. Last<br />\nF ORFriday's<br />\ndefeat was not as one-sided as those of the two previous<br />\nyears. Hopkins has improved. The Jays did not get the breaks in any<br />\nway. The wet weather which hindered the Jay passing attack was advantageous to the heavy, hard-charging St. John's line. The improvement over Jay teams of the last two years was noticeable, however. A<br />\ndry day and a few breaks early in the game might have resulted in a<br />\nvictory for the Homewood eleven.<br />\nThe most noticeable difference in the play of the two teams was<br />\nthe tackling. In this department the visitors outclassed the home<br />\nteam. We believe that a word of explanation is necessary on this<br />\npoint. The Hopkins team has had live tackling practice only once this<br />\nyear. The coaching staff feels that it can better afford loose tackling<br />\nthan take the chance of losing several valuable members of the team.<br />\nIt is again the lack of reserve strength that accounts for the Jay weakness. In future years, if the amount of available material continues<br />\nto increase as it did this season, better tackling and better teams may<br />\nbe expected.<br />\nSt. John's pointed for this game, and played almost flawlessly<br />\nthroughout the contest. The Jays never had a chance after Armacost's<br />\n65-yard run, but did not completely collapse as the teams of the two<br />\nprevious years have done. They fought the Johnnies during the<br />\nsecond half, and deserve credit for playing a superior and more experienced eleven to a standstill during the last thirty minutes of play.<br />\nIt was the lack of reserve strength that was again responsible for the<br />\ndefeat of the Homewood eleven.<br />\n<br />\nThe Y. M. C. A.'s seven-day<br />\ncampaign for funds was officially<br />\nclosed last Friday at a luncheon<br />\nmeeting of the team captains in<br />\nLevering Hall.

Thereupon the ruler<br />\nsummoned the best ivory sculptor<br />\nin the country and commissioned<br />\nhim to carve a Kuan Yin statue of<br />\nthe tusk of this elephant. For three<br />\nyears the artist worked continuously.<br />\nThe model for this figure was the<br />\npainting that was done by the greatest of all Chinese artists of the<br />\nT'ang dynasty, Wu Tao-Tze. He<br />\nwas the court painter for Emperor<br />\nMing Huang. His divine inspiration emanated from his intensive<br />\nstudy of the Buddhist scriptures.<br />\nThis subject absorbed him so completely that he often had visions of<br />\nBuddhist figures floating in mid-air,<br />\nfigures that were seen by no other<br />\nthan him.

The figure including the<br />\nbase stands twenty-four inches in<br />\nheight. This is a masterpiece in<br />\nwhich the artist attained the greatest degree of perfection ever hoped<br />\nto be reached by anyone.

FUND DRIVE<br />\nEXCEEDS SET GOAL<br /><br />\nnight at the Lyric Theatre four leading minds expressed<br />\nLAST<br />\ndiversified views on their respective spiritual beliefs. Those who<br />\nwere present at the religious forum were undoubtedly swayed more<br />\nby the speaker who preached the doctrines which they themselves upheld. This is only natural. It stands to reason that a person will<br />\nsupport those things which were drilled into him since childhood by<br />\nthe various organs of his sect. However, gatherings such as last night's<br />\nat which the views' of intelligent men are brought fefore the public<br />\nin an unbiased light, tend to bring the visions of the prophets nearer<br />\nto reality. And yet, certain individuals are so constituted that they<br />\nbear contempt towards anyone who holds a religious belief which<br />\ndiffers from their own.<br />\nIt seems that the college man trends towards a general laxity as<br />\nfar as actual belief in a divine being is concerned. He admits that the<br />\nvarious religious sects have done a great deal of good in upholding the<br />\nmorals and promoting the welfare of the community. Strange to say,<br />\nthe uneducated man takes the teachings of the church verbatim and<br />\nbelieves he sees, hears and feels his God, while the educated man<br />\nsays, \"I don't know.\" This is a factor which religious leaders are<br />\ntrying to offset, and accounts in a way for the growing liberalizing<br />\ninfluence in religion.<br />\nThe college man should have definite religious beliefs. It seems<br />\nquite ignorant to say, \"I don't know.\" Such an answer is not sufficient.<br />\nMore attention should be given to the consideraiton of the problems<br />\nand philosophy of religion. The college man should, at least, be able<br />\nto discuss them with an intelligent and unprejudiced point of view.<br />\nS. L.<br /><br />\nRESERVE STRENGTH<br />\nthree successive years the Jays have bowed to St. John's. Last<br />\nF ORFriday's<br />\ndefeat was not as one-sided as those of the two previous<br />\nyears. Hopkins has improved. The Jays did not get the breaks in any<br />\nway. The wet weather which hindered the Jay passing attack was advantageous to the heavy, hard-charging St. John's line. The improvement over Jay teams of the last two years was noticeable, however. A<br />\ndry day and a few breaks early in the game might have resulted in a<br />\nvictory for the Homewood eleven.<br />\nThe most noticeable difference in the play of the two teams was<br />\nthe tackling. In this department the visitors outclassed the home<br />\nteam. We believe that a word of explanation is necessary on this<br />\npoint. The Hopkins team has had live tackling practice only once this<br />\nyear. The coaching staff feels that it can better afford loose tackling<br />\nthan take the chance of losing several valuable members of the team.<br />\nIt is again the lack of reserve strength that accounts for the Jay weakness. In future years, if the amount of available material continues<br />\nto increase as it did this season, better tackling and better teams may<br />\nbe expected.<br />\nSt. John's pointed for this game, and played almost flawlessly<br />\nthroughout the contest. The Jays never had a chance after Armacost's<br />\n65-yard run, but did not completely collapse as the teams of the two<br />\nprevious years have done. They fought the Johnnies during the<br />\nsecond half, and deserve credit for playing a superior and more experienced eleven to a standstill during the last thirty minutes of play.<br />\nIt was the lack of reserve strength that was again responsible for the<br />\ndefeat of the Homewood eleven.<br /><br />\nThe Y. M. C. A.'s seven-day<br />\ncampaign for funds was officially<br />\nclosed last Friday at a luncheon<br />\nmeeting of the team captains in<br />\nLevering Hall. The pledges of<br />\nthose whos have responded to the<br />\n\"Y's\" call for finances amounted to<br />\n$1461.25, or approximately $225 in<br />\nexcess of the goal originally set.<br />\nMr. Schaal, executive secretary<br />\nof the \"Y,\" received the reports of<br />\nthe various team captains as to the<br />\namounts which their groups had<br />\ncollected. The only extraordinary<br />\nsum reported was that announced<br />\nby Gus Burke.
