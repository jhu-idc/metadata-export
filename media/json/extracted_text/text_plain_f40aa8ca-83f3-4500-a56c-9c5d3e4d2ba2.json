Rather he was suggesting a perpetuation of the division with a<br />\nguarantee that South Vietnam be neutralized.<br />\nLeft unanswered were two large questions:<br />\nFirst, would the United States treat with the<br />\nViet Cong insurgents in fashioning a political<br />\nsettlement in South Vietnam. and second, which<br />\npowers would be called upon to guarantee a<br />\nsettlement\u2014specifically, would Red China be<br />\nincluded?<br />\nYet despite this vagueness. the President's declaration does provide a pretext for a Washington-Hanoi dialogue.<br />\nFailing this, it attempts to place the onus for<br />\ncontinuation and broadening of the conflict on<br />\nthe Viet Cong and their North Vietnamese supporters.<br />\nAt the same time. Johnson restated the<br />\nAmerican resolve to stay in Viet Nam until a<br />\nsettlement is reached.<br />\n\"We will not be defeated. We will not grow<br />\ntired.

It. was the<br />\nsecond time in seven months<br />\nthat the President has visited<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nBecause of previous speaking<br />\nengagements. Hopkins President<br />\nDr. Milton S. Eisenhower was<br />\nunable to be present to introduce President Johnson. Charles<br />\nS. Garland, chairman of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, performed<br />\nthis office instead.<br />\nAccompanying<br />\n<br />\nthe President<br />\n<br />\non the stage were Vice President<br />\nHumphrey, Mrs. Johnson, their<br />\ntwo daughters Linda Bird and<br />\nLuci, and Mrs. Humphrey.<br />\nShriver Hall was filled to capacity for the nationally televised speech. Due to a misunderstanding on the part of Captain<br />\nWiles of the Baltimore Fire Department, only 1180 people were<br />\nallowed to enter the auditorium,<br />\nwith the Clipper Room, equipped<br />\nwith two televisions, remaining<br />\nempty. Fifty to 150 persons who<br />\noriginally were admitted subsequently were turned away.<br />\n<br />\npresent at the speech were Democratic Senators Tydings and<br />\nBrewster, who entered the auditorium early and received strong<br />\napplause. Former Hopkins Economics professor Clarence Long,<br />\nnow Democratic Congressman<br />\nfrom Maryland, received the<br />\nloudest pre-speech applause.<br />\n<br />\nTh presidential party arrived<br />\nat Shriver Hall in White House<br />\nlimousines, the trip by helicopter<br />\nhaving been cancelled because<br />\nof the weather.

While other<br />\nmore important concerns obviously motivated Johnson<br />\nto speak outside of Washington, to a non-political audience, it cannot he denied that the context of his speech<br />\non Wednesday was of particular concern to the politically moving forces on campuses. The indication that<br />\nthe U.S. is prepared to negotiate unconditionally is<br />\nprogress (although indications in the past seemed to<br />\ndemonstrate a willingness of the government to negotiate no concrete statements had been made in support<br />\nof such a proposal.)<br />\nThe announcement Wednesday is of course only<br />\nan indication that negotiations and eventual settlement<br />\nwill occur, but it is nevertheless a breakdown of the<br />\nadamant militaristic stand of only a few months ago.<br />\nif students come to an eventual recognition of a<br />\nunity of cause and concern, with a mature approach<br />\ntoward protest tactics it appears that students as a<br />\nwhole can be recognized and respected. Just one example<br />\nof effective student protestation is the civil rights movement that has largely been successful because of a<br />\nrecognized common interest. in this case the unity<br />\narises out of dissent, but a recogniton of concrete beliefs among students could move them to favor as well<br />\nas to oppose.<br />\n<br />\nThe clicionewood Scene<br />\nBy HENRY KORN<br />\nA first-hand opportunity to<br />\nobserve the machinations of<br />\npolitics and politicians, most of<br />\nus at 1:opkins discovered this<br />\nweek, is a complex task. No more<br />\ncomplex however than the art of<br />\nskillful rhetoric of which, interestingly enough, politicians<br />\nare not the only practitioners.<br />\nFor both McGeorge Bundy and<br />\nLyndon Johnson are nowhere<br />\nnear a close match with White<br />\nHouse Secretary George Reedy<br />\nwho is without a doubt the least<br />\ncomprehensible man in the whole<br />\nof Washington. Reedy, the literal<br />\nheavyweight chimp (recently<br />\nparred from a ponderous 275 to<br />\nGreat Society self-like 205) carries on in the rotund Pierre \"I<br />\nmay be plucky but I'm not<br />\nstupid\" Salinger tradition. For<br />\nReedy in his early days resembled a silver-haired blimp.<br />\nWhen a hippie on the Washington Press Corps created what<br />\nhe called a \"fog index\" (reflecting the amount of education required for understanding a particular person) Reedy led easily,<br />\noutdistanced his nearest rival<br />\n(either Casey Stengel or Former<br />\nPresident Eisenhower) by scoring a 24. This meant that it<br />\nwould take a person with twenty<br />\n<br />\nyears of graduate training to<br />\nglean a remote bit of sesne from<br />\nReedy's remarks. One would<br />\nsuppose that the object of choosing a man with such talent lies<br />\nin an attempt to beat the White<br />\nHouse Press gang (notorious for<br />\ntransforming their releases into<br />\nactual news) at what is felt is<br />\ntheir own game; distortion.<br />\nThus it was disappointing that<br />\nReedy did not make a public appearance in Shriver Hall on<br />\nWednesday leaving the art of<br />\nmicrophone testing to Presidential aide Jack Valenti. Reedy was<br />\nhowever reported to have prowled the basement of Shriver before the speech.<br />\nIt was just about that time<br />\nthat \"our man in the basement\"<br />\nspotted Linda and Luci entering<br />\nthe ladies room in the guest<br />\nlounge. While the exact time<br />\n(reported to be 8:35 P.M.) was<br />\nnot confirmed we did discover<br />\nthat Hopkins administrator Ron<br />\nWolk was considering a brass<br />\nplaque in commemoration of the<br />\nevent. A short time later Linda<br />\nwent for a brief stroll and in<br />\nthe words of our reporter \"stirred<br />\nup some excitement.\" It is little<br />\nwonder that this happened as<br />\nboth young ladies seemed to have<br />\n<br />\nbeen misinformed that the telecast was to be in living color.<br />\nWhile Linda exercised, her<br />\nfather stood in the ladies lounge<br />\nposing for photographs with<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins administration. The President seemed<br />\nto enjoy the fact that each picture would soon be proudly displayed in various Baltimore living rooms.<br />\nAfter the speech we were given<br />\nan opportunity to turn our attention to Vice-President and<br />\nMrs. Humphrey. When asked if<br />\nhis January invitation to meet<br />\nand talk with students remained<br />\nvalid Mr. Humphrey answered<br />\nyes.

The views expressed by the professors differ greatly and<br />\nare presented here to contrast ideas concerning Vietnam policy.<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 3A<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gottfried Dietze is a professor in the Political science department.

TUCKER<br />\n<br />\nDIETZE ON VIETNAM<br />\nQuestion: Viet Nam for the Vietnamese is a familiar phrase among<br />\nprevailing protestations. What is<br />\nyour stand on this assertion?<br />\nAnswer: As a matter of principle,<br />\ncountries should be self-governing.<br />\nWhat I doubt is whether the South<br />\nVietnamese, under Communist control, would possess self-government.<br />\nUnder the Viet Cong, the South Vietnamese would be a satellite that is<br />\ndirected from Moscow, or from<br />\nChina.<br />\nQuestion: Then should our approach be a pragmatic one rather<br />\nthan a moral one, involving a front<br />\nagainst Communism and a preservation of our national interest and<br />\nprestige; rather than a move toward<br />\nproviding both a sound moral solution to the killing and desires for<br />\nself determination?<br />\nAnswer: While we must take into<br />\nconsideration<br />\nexisting<br />\nfacts, we<br />\nshould also be interested in the preservation of freedom. I am convinced<br />\nthat the people of South Vietnam<br />\ndo not want Communism. They do<br />\nwant to have a free government.<br />\nQuestion: The protestors advocate<br />\nImmediate withdrawal and negotiation. Is this concurrent with your<br />\nview of the issues?<br />\nAnswer: I am opposed to immediate<br />\nwithdrawal. In negotiations, we<br />\nshould not make concessions to the<br />\nViet Cong; in general, it is risky to<br />\nnegotiate with the Communists. For<br />\nwhile the West adheres to the agreements, the Communists usually do<br />\nnot.<br />\n<br />\nQuestion: Would you say the Viet<br />\nCong is supported by a diverse set of<br />\ngroups as do many populists, or<br />\nwould you say it is a venture supported and sustained by the Cornmunists?<br />\nAnswer: I think the latter is the<br />\ncase. I have always suspected that<br />\ncommunist moves, wherever they occur in the world, are directed by<br />\nMoscow. When the Communists advocate, \"Viet Nam for the Vietnamese\", this concession to nationalism is a \"tactical retreat\" for the<br />\nfurtherance of Communist strategy<br />\nas prescribed by Lenin.<br />\nQuestion: What do you think are<br />\nthe relative roles of Moscow and<br />\nPeking in this issue?<br />\nAnswer: I do not think there is a<br />\nserious split between the Chinese<br />\nCommunists and Moscow: I think it<br />\nis a put-up job to lull the Western<br />\npowers into complacency.<br />\nQuestion: Do you think it is the<br />\nkind of thing which has just been<br />\npicked up by the Western press?<br />\nAnswer: Yes. People in the West<br />\nlike to read what is convenient and<br />\nwhat sounds good. They feel at ease<br />\nabout international tensions. I don't<br />\nthink the rift between Moscow and<br />\nPeking is serious. It is not more serious than the rifts between the United<br />\nStates and Britain. When the chips<br />\nare down, they will stick together.<br />\nThe Russians are very interested in<br />\nemphasizing the split, because in this<br />\nway, they appear in the eyes of the<br />\nWestern World as a proponent of<br />\npeace.<br />\n<br />\nTUCKER ON VIETNAM<br />\nQuestion:<br />\nDr. Tucker, would you comment<br />\nupon the evolution of United States<br />\npolicy in Vietnam, and criticize, if<br />\nyou can, any aspect of our policy<br />\nthere?<br />\nMy main criticism of American<br />\npolicy in Vietnam is that the Administration waited so long in order<br />\nto bring matters to a head. It was<br />\napparent at least a year ago that the<br />\nwar in South Vietnam was beginning<br />\nto enter a critical phase and that the<br />\nposition of the South Vietnamese<br />\ngovernment was deteriorating at a<br />\nrapid rate. I realize it is a counsel<br />\nof perfection to say at this juncture<br />\nthat the Administration should have<br />\nsought to improve its position last<br />\nspring and then to have attempted<br />\nnegotiation from that position. It<br />\nis a counsel of perfection in the first<br />\nplace because governments do not<br />\ngenerally take such action until they<br />\nare forced to do so. It is a counsel<br />\nof perfection in the second place because democratic governments can<br />\nrarely be expected to take such difficult decisions during an election<br />\nyeM.. The fact of the matter is that<br />\nthroughout the campaign. President<br />\nJohnson would barely discuss the<br />\nVietnamese situation and when he<br />\ndid discuss it it was in terms of deriding any proposal that we might have<br />\nto expand the war.<br />\nQuestion:<br />\nTo what extent is the U.S. militarily committeed to the South Vietnamese and what effect will the<br />\npresent expansion of the war have<br />\nupon the outcome?<br />\n<br />\nMonday Rally<br />\nStudents for a Democratic Society and<br />\nThe Committee for a Vote in Selma<br />\nand South Vietnam co-sponsored a rally<br />\nfollowing the speech of McGeorge Bundy<br />\non Monday, April fifth. The purpose of<br />\nthe rally was to protest United States<br />\npolicy in Vietnam as represented by its<br />\n\"architect\" McGeorge Bundy. However,<br />\nthe actual form of the rally was formulated after complex, round-the-clock<br />\ndiscussions and negotiations between the<br />\nco-sponsors.<br />\n<br />\nIL<br />\n<br />\nThe Committee advocated a blatant<br />\nattempt to disrupt the Bundy lecture by<br />\nblowing whistles and leaving the hall to<br />\nbegin the rally. S.D.S., anxious to prevent such a disturbance, proposed that<br />\nthe rally be announced during the question and answer period that was to follow the lecture. This was done inspite<br />\nof the fact that Bundy announced the<br />\ntime and place of the rally himself at<br />\nthe start of his lecture.<br />\nThe rally, held in front of the partially constructed classroom building was<br />\nattended ,by 250 persons representing all<br />\npoints of view. In the wake of the controversial form of the second rally announcement (criticized by many as rude<br />\nsince the announcement interrupted<br />\nBundy), S.D.S. supporters pointed out<br />\nthat they felt that there was a great<br />\n<br />\nIt was inevitable that unless we<br />\nwere prepared simply to withdraw<br />\nignominiously from South Vietnam<br />\nor to make a very substantial commitment in ground troops that we<br />\nwould have to expand the war as<br />\nwe have now done. No one can yet<br />\nsay whether this expansion has come<br />\ntoo late to make a material difference. In part, of course, the answer<br />\ndepends on what we want.. Perhaps<br />\nit is not too late if our aim is essentially one of obtaining an external victory of sorts in order to sustain an internal defeat. By this I<br />\nmean that if we are reconciled to<br />\nan outcome within South Vietnam<br />\nwhich will mean a coalition government of sorts \u2014 coupled probably<br />\nby a neutralization formula for the<br />\ncountry \u2014 then the present expansin of the war could have as its<br />\npurpose the saving of face. Or, put<br />\nin other words, a graceful withdrawal. What we would, in fact, be<br />\ntelling the North Vietnamese and<br />\nthe Chinese is that although we are<br />\nprepared to accept a compromise<br />\nsolution, and a solution which necessarily falls far short of the hopes<br />\nwe originally entertained, that solution cannot simply be imposed. If,<br />\non the other hand, the meaning of<br />\nthe present expansion of the war<br />\nis that we still entertain a favorable<br />\noutcome of the conflict within South<br />\nVietnam \u2014 that is. a clear victory<br />\nof the South Vietnamese government over the Viet Cong \u2014 then it<br />\nseems to me that the expansion has<br />\ncome much too late.

S.D.S. provided the<br />\nmost outstanding speaker, Charles Capper who was so effective that during his<br />\nspeech the crowd listened silently. This<br />\nwas not so in the brief tenure of the<br />\nther speakers. They faced persistent<br />\nheckling reminiscent of the \"Foul<br />\nSpeech Movement' at BerkeleN. Perhaps<br />\nthe most unfortunate incident was the<br />\ndumping of water from a window in the<br />\nbuilding on to the podium. The perpetrator was identified as a member of<br />\nBeta Theta Pi Fraternity.<br />\nThe character of Monday's rally was<br />\nbest explained by a foreign exchange<br />\nstudent who attended. He said \"American<br />\ncollege boys have no political maturity.<br />\nThey make a panty raid out of a political rally.\" While much of the rally could<br />\nonly be seen in terms of a serious failure<br />\nin creating a much needed dialogue<br />\nwithin the Hopkins Community, it can<br />\nbe said with certainty that the rally accomplished much of its purpose.<br />\n<br />\nAn estimated crowd of 350 persons<br />\ngathered in Wyman Quadrangle last<br />\nWednesday night following a nationwide foreign policy speech by President<br />\nJohnson to attend a rally sponsored by<br />\nthe Students for a Democratic Society.<br />\nNotable among those who spoke out<br />\nagainst the administration's policy in<br />\nSouth Viet Nam was Steve Weissman,<br />\na graduate student at the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Berkeley and co-leader of<br />\nthe recent Free Speech movement on<br />\nthat campus.<br />\nThe first speaker at the hour-long<br />\nrally was Dr. Waldo Heinrichs, a professor in the Hopkins department of<br />\nhistory and a specialist in Far-Fa-stern<br />\naffairs. He stated that \"we must not<br />\nbe laggards in the search for peace,\"<br />\nand that the current escalation of the<br />\nwar can only lead to a confrontation<br />\nwith other major powers. Emphasizing<br />\nthe need for diversity in the world,<br />\nProfessor Heinrichs said: \"We want<br />\nboth an independent North Viet Nam<br />\nand an independent South Viet Nam,<br />\neach able to develop in its own way.\"<br />\nIn a consideration of President Johnson's proposal for a billion dollar aid<br />\nprogram for Southeast Asia, the professor registered his strong approval of<br />\nsuch a measure, although he feels that<br />\nit should be accompanied with a plan<br />\nfor negotiations. \"The President must<br />\n<br />\n'IR<br />\n<br />\n1/4<br />\n<br />\nrealize that force will not accomplish<br />\nhis objectives,\" Heinrichs said, and that<br />\nfurther attacks on North Viet Nam will<br />\nonly push the country closer to Red<br />\nChina. \"We must be prepared to compromise,\" he concluded. (Professor<br />\nHeinrichs outlined a possible plan for<br />\nnegotiation and withdrawal in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter.)<br />\nCharles Capper, spokesman for Hopkins SDS, followed Heinrichs. In answer to some observers who had burst<br />\nforth mockingly with strains from \"The<br />\nStar-Spangled Banner,\" Capper retorted: \"We are trying to seek rational<br />\nalternatives. You do not do this by<br />\nsinging chants which close off ears to<br />\nall alternatives.\"<br />\nAs he did at the rally held last Monday following the appearance at Hopkins of McGeorge Bundy, Capper briefly examined and evaluated the United<br />\nStates' position in South Viet Nam since<br />\n1954, explaining that, contrary to the<br />\nadministration's contention, the Viet<br />\nCong is an \"indigenous insurgency of<br />\nSouth Vietnamese against Americansupported dictators.\"<br />\nCapper announced that an estimated<br />\n1500 persons will participate in a March<br />\non Washington April 17 to protest the<br />\npresent policy in Viet Nam.

Rather he was suggesting a perpetuation of the division with a<br />\nguarantee that South Vietnam be neutralized.<br />\nLeft unanswered were two large questions:<br />\nFirst, would the United States treat with the<br />\nViet Cong insurgents in fashioning a political<br />\nsettlement in South Vietnam. and second, which<br />\npowers would be called upon to guarantee a<br />\nsettlement\u2014specifically, would Red China be<br />\nincluded?<br />\nYet despite this vagueness. the President's declaration does provide a pretext for a Washington-Hanoi dialogue.<br />\nFailing this, it attempts to place the onus for<br />\ncontinuation and broadening of the conflict on<br />\nthe Viet Cong and their North Vietnamese supporters.<br />\nAt the same time. Johnson restated the<br />\nAmerican resolve to stay in Viet Nam until a<br />\nsettlement is reached.<br />\n\"We will not be defeated. We will not grow<br />\ntired. We will not withdraw, either openly or<br />\nunder the cloak of a meaningless agreement.\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"I wish it were possible to convince others with<br />\nwords of what we now find it necessary to say<br />\nwith guns and planes: armed hostility is futile<br />\n\u2014our resources are equal to any challenge,\" the<br />\nPresident declared.<br />\n\"Once this is clear, then it should also be clear<br />\nthat the only path for reasonable men is the path<br />\nof peaceful settlement,\" he said.<br /><br />\nNEWS<br /><br />\nHere Comes Everybody<br />\nPresident Johnson spoke at<br />\nShriver Hall on Wednesday night<br />\nin a major policy speech on the<br />\ncurrent United States position<br />\nin South Vietnam. It. was the<br />\nsecond time in seven months<br />\nthat the President has visited<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nBecause of previous speaking<br />\nengagements. Hopkins President<br />\nDr. Milton S. Eisenhower was<br />\nunable to be present to introduce President Johnson. Charles<br />\nS. Garland, chairman of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, performed<br />\nthis office instead.<br />\nAccompanying<br /><br />\nthe President<br /><br />\non the stage were Vice President<br />\nHumphrey, Mrs. Johnson, their<br />\ntwo daughters Linda Bird and<br />\nLuci, and Mrs. Humphrey.<br />\nShriver Hall was filled to capacity for the nationally televised speech. Due to a misunderstanding on the part of Captain<br />\nWiles of the Baltimore Fire Department, only 1180 people were<br />\nallowed to enter the auditorium,<br />\nwith the Clipper Room, equipped<br />\nwith two televisions, remaining<br />\nempty. Fifty to 150 persons who<br />\noriginally were admitted subsequently were turned away.<br /><br />\npresent at the speech were Democratic Senators Tydings and<br />\nBrewster, who entered the auditorium early and received strong<br />\napplause. Former Hopkins Economics professor Clarence Long,<br />\nnow Democratic Congressman<br />\nfrom Maryland, received the<br />\nloudest pre-speech applause.<br /><br />\nTh presidential party arrived<br />\nat Shriver Hall in White House<br />\nlimousines, the trip by helicopter<br />\nhaving been cancelled because<br />\nof the weather. After his speech,<br />\nthe President immediately reAmong the notable politicians turned to Washington.<br /><br />\nEditorial<br />\nThat Prsident Johnson should select a University<br />\nfor such an important statement of foreign policy seems<br />\nto indicate that the executive is showing at least a<br />\nmodicum of concern for student opinion. While other<br />\nmore important concerns obviously motivated Johnson<br />\nto speak outside of Washington, to a non-political audience, it cannot he denied that the context of his speech<br />\non Wednesday was of particular concern to the politically moving forces on campuses. The indication that<br />\nthe U.S. is prepared to negotiate unconditionally is<br />\nprogress (although indications in the past seemed to<br />\ndemonstrate a willingness of the government to negotiate no concrete statements had been made in support<br />\nof such a proposal.)<br />\nThe announcement Wednesday is of course only<br />\nan indication that negotiations and eventual settlement<br />\nwill occur, but it is nevertheless a breakdown of the<br />\nadamant militaristic stand of only a few months ago.<br />\nif students come to an eventual recognition of a<br />\nunity of cause and concern, with a mature approach<br />\ntoward protest tactics it appears that students as a<br />\nwhole can be recognized and respected. Just one example<br />\nof effective student protestation is the civil rights movement that has largely been successful because of a<br />\nrecognized common interest. in this case the unity<br />\narises out of dissent, but a recogniton of concrete beliefs among students could move them to favor as well<br />\nas to oppose.<br /><br />\nThe clicionewood Scene<br />\nBy HENRY KORN<br />\nA first-hand opportunity to<br />\nobserve the machinations of<br />\npolitics and politicians, most of<br />\nus at 1:opkins discovered this<br />\nweek, is a complex task. No more<br />\ncomplex however than the art of<br />\nskillful rhetoric of which, interestingly enough, politicians<br />\nare not the only practitioners.<br />\nFor both McGeorge Bundy and<br />\nLyndon Johnson are nowhere<br />\nnear a close match with White<br />\nHouse Secretary George Reedy<br />\nwho is without a doubt the least<br />\ncomprehensible man in the whole<br />\nof Washington. Reedy, the literal<br />\nheavyweight chimp (recently<br />\nparred from a ponderous 275 to<br />\nGreat Society self-like 205) carries on in the rotund Pierre \"I<br />\nmay be plucky but I'm not<br />\nstupid\" Salinger tradition. For<br />\nReedy in his early days resembled a silver-haired blimp.<br />\nWhen a hippie on the Washington Press Corps created what<br />\nhe called a \"fog index\" (reflecting the amount of education required for understanding a particular person) Reedy led easily,<br />\noutdistanced his nearest rival<br />\n(either Casey Stengel or Former<br />\nPresident Eisenhower) by scoring a 24. This meant that it<br />\nwould take a person with twenty<br /><br />\nyears of graduate training to<br />\nglean a remote bit of sesne from<br />\nReedy's remarks. One would<br />\nsuppose that the object of choosing a man with such talent lies<br />\nin an attempt to beat the White<br />\nHouse Press gang (notorious for<br />\ntransforming their releases into<br />\nactual news) at what is felt is<br />\ntheir own game; distortion.<br />\nThus it was disappointing that<br />\nReedy did not make a public appearance in Shriver Hall on<br />\nWednesday leaving the art of<br />\nmicrophone testing to Presidential aide Jack Valenti. Reedy was<br />\nhowever reported to have prowled the basement of Shriver before the speech.<br />\nIt was just about that time<br />\nthat \"our man in the basement\"<br />\nspotted Linda and Luci entering<br />\nthe ladies room in the guest<br />\nlounge. While the exact time<br />\n(reported to be 8:35 P.M.) was<br />\nnot confirmed we did discover<br />\nthat Hopkins administrator Ron<br />\nWolk was considering a brass<br />\nplaque in commemoration of the<br />\nevent. A short time later Linda<br />\nwent for a brief stroll and in<br />\nthe words of our reporter \"stirred<br />\nup some excitement.\" It is little<br />\nwonder that this happened as<br />\nboth young ladies seemed to have<br /><br />\nbeen misinformed that the telecast was to be in living color.<br />\nWhile Linda exercised, her<br />\nfather stood in the ladies lounge<br />\nposing for photographs with<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins administration. The President seemed<br />\nto enjoy the fact that each picture would soon be proudly displayed in various Baltimore living rooms.<br />\nAfter the speech we were given<br />\nan opportunity to turn our attention to Vice-President and<br />\nMrs. Humphrey. When asked if<br />\nhis January invitation to meet<br />\nand talk with students remained<br />\nvalid Mr. Humphrey answered<br />\nyes. Muriel Humphrey, our man<br />\nquoted as saying \"loves college<br />\nstudents.\" They are an ingratiating and engaging pair of<br />\nadults and can be assured that<br />\ntheir affection and respect is returned.<br />\nThis incidentally marks the<br />\nsecond time in the history of<br />\nthe University that both the<br />\nPresident and Vice-President<br />\nhave visited Johns Hopkins twice<br />\nin the same year.

The views expressed by the professors differ greatly and<br />\nare presented here to contrast ideas concerning Vietnam policy.<br /><br />\nPAGE 3A<br /><br />\nDr. Gottfried Dietze is a professor in the Political science department.

TUCKER<br /><br />\nDIETZE ON VIETNAM<br />\nQuestion: Viet Nam for the Vietnamese is a familiar phrase among<br />\nprevailing protestations. What is<br />\nyour stand on this assertion?<br />\nAnswer: As a matter of principle,<br />\ncountries should be self-governing.<br />\nWhat I doubt is whether the South<br />\nVietnamese, under Communist control, would possess self-government.<br />\nUnder the Viet Cong, the South Vietnamese would be a satellite that is<br />\ndirected from Moscow, or from<br />\nChina.<br />\nQuestion: Then should our approach be a pragmatic one rather<br />\nthan a moral one, involving a front<br />\nagainst Communism and a preservation of our national interest and<br />\nprestige; rather than a move toward<br />\nproviding both a sound moral solution to the killing and desires for<br />\nself determination?<br />\nAnswer: While we must take into<br />\nconsideration<br />\nexisting<br />\nfacts, we<br />\nshould also be interested in the preservation of freedom. I am convinced<br />\nthat the people of South Vietnam<br />\ndo not want Communism. They do<br />\nwant to have a free government.<br />\nQuestion: The protestors advocate<br />\nImmediate withdrawal and negotiation. Is this concurrent with your<br />\nview of the issues?<br />\nAnswer: I am opposed to immediate<br />\nwithdrawal. In negotiations, we<br />\nshould not make concessions to the<br />\nViet Cong; in general, it is risky to<br />\nnegotiate with the Communists. For<br />\nwhile the West adheres to the agreements, the Communists usually do<br />\nnot.<br /><br />\nQuestion: Would you say the Viet<br />\nCong is supported by a diverse set of<br />\ngroups as do many populists, or<br />\nwould you say it is a venture supported and sustained by the Cornmunists?<br />\nAnswer: I think the latter is the<br />\ncase. I have always suspected that<br />\ncommunist moves, wherever they occur in the world, are directed by<br />\nMoscow. When the Communists advocate, \"Viet Nam for the Vietnamese\", this concession to nationalism is a \"tactical retreat\" for the<br />\nfurtherance of Communist strategy<br />\nas prescribed by Lenin.<br />\nQuestion: What do you think are<br />\nthe relative roles of Moscow and<br />\nPeking in this issue?<br />\nAnswer: I do not think there is a<br />\nserious split between the Chinese<br />\nCommunists and Moscow: I think it<br />\nis a put-up job to lull the Western<br />\npowers into complacency.<br />\nQuestion: Do you think it is the<br />\nkind of thing which has just been<br />\npicked up by the Western press?<br />\nAnswer: Yes. People in the West<br />\nlike to read what is convenient and<br />\nwhat sounds good. They feel at ease<br />\nabout international tensions. I don't<br />\nthink the rift between Moscow and<br />\nPeking is serious. It is not more serious than the rifts between the United<br />\nStates and Britain. When the chips<br />\nare down, they will stick together.<br />\nThe Russians are very interested in<br />\nemphasizing the split, because in this<br />\nway, they appear in the eyes of the<br />\nWestern World as a proponent of<br />\npeace.<br /><br />\nTUCKER ON VIETNAM<br />\nQuestion:<br />\nDr. Tucker, would you comment<br />\nupon the evolution of United States<br />\npolicy in Vietnam, and criticize, if<br />\nyou can, any aspect of our policy<br />\nthere?<br />\nMy main criticism of American<br />\npolicy in Vietnam is that the Administration waited so long in order<br />\nto bring matters to a head. It was<br />\napparent at least a year ago that the<br />\nwar in South Vietnam was beginning<br />\nto enter a critical phase and that the<br />\nposition of the South Vietnamese<br />\ngovernment was deteriorating at a<br />\nrapid rate. I realize it is a counsel<br />\nof perfection to say at this juncture<br />\nthat the Administration should have<br />\nsought to improve its position last<br />\nspring and then to have attempted<br />\nnegotiation from that position. It<br />\nis a counsel of perfection in the first<br />\nplace because governments do not<br />\ngenerally take such action until they<br />\nare forced to do so. It is a counsel<br />\nof perfection in the second place because democratic governments can<br />\nrarely be expected to take such difficult decisions during an election<br />\nyeM.. The fact of the matter is that<br />\nthroughout the campaign. President<br />\nJohnson would barely discuss the<br />\nVietnamese situation and when he<br />\ndid discuss it it was in terms of deriding any proposal that we might have<br />\nto expand the war.<br />\nQuestion:<br />\nTo what extent is the U.S. militarily committeed to the South Vietnamese and what effect will the<br />\npresent expansion of the war have<br />\nupon the outcome?<br /><br />\nMonday Rally<br />\nStudents for a Democratic Society and<br />\nThe Committee for a Vote in Selma<br />\nand South Vietnam co-sponsored a rally<br />\nfollowing the speech of McGeorge Bundy<br />\non Monday, April fifth. The purpose of<br />\nthe rally was to protest United States<br />\npolicy in Vietnam as represented by its<br />\n\"architect\" McGeorge Bundy. However,<br />\nthe actual form of the rally was formulated after complex, round-the-clock<br />\ndiscussions and negotiations between the<br />\nco-sponsors.<br /><br />\nIL<br /><br />\nThe Committee advocated a blatant<br />\nattempt to disrupt the Bundy lecture by<br />\nblowing whistles and leaving the hall to<br />\nbegin the rally. S.D.S., anxious to prevent such a disturbance, proposed that<br />\nthe rally be announced during the question and answer period that was to follow the lecture. This was done inspite<br />\nof the fact that Bundy announced the<br />\ntime and place of the rally himself at<br />\nthe start of his lecture.<br />\nThe rally, held in front of the partially constructed classroom building was<br />\nattended ,by 250 persons representing all<br />\npoints of view. In the wake of the controversial form of the second rally announcement (criticized by many as rude<br />\nsince the announcement interrupted<br />\nBundy), S.D.S. supporters pointed out<br />\nthat they felt that there was a great<br /><br />\nIt was inevitable that unless we<br />\nwere prepared simply to withdraw<br />\nignominiously from South Vietnam<br />\nor to make a very substantial commitment in ground troops that we<br />\nwould have to expand the war as<br />\nwe have now done. No one can yet<br />\nsay whether this expansion has come<br />\ntoo late to make a material difference. In part, of course, the answer<br />\ndepends on what we want.. Perhaps<br />\nit is not too late if our aim is essentially one of obtaining an external victory of sorts in order to sustain an internal defeat. By this I<br />\nmean that if we are reconciled to<br />\nan outcome within South Vietnam<br />\nwhich will mean a coalition government of sorts \u2014 coupled probably<br />\nby a neutralization formula for the<br />\ncountry \u2014 then the present expansin of the war could have as its<br />\npurpose the saving of face. Or, put<br />\nin other words, a graceful withdrawal. What we would, in fact, be<br />\ntelling the North Vietnamese and<br />\nthe Chinese is that although we are<br />\nprepared to accept a compromise<br />\nsolution, and a solution which necessarily falls far short of the hopes<br />\nwe originally entertained, that solution cannot simply be imposed. If,<br />\non the other hand, the meaning of<br />\nthe present expansion of the war<br />\nis that we still entertain a favorable<br />\noutcome of the conflict within South<br />\nVietnam \u2014 that is. a clear victory<br />\nof the South Vietnamese government over the Viet Cong \u2014 then it<br />\nseems to me that the expansion has<br />\ncome much too late.

They<br />\ndescribed the catcalls and booing as<br />\n\"symptomatic of<br />\nBundy advocated<br />\nAmerican Unity, a conformity that<br />\nthwarts the questioning and dialogue so<br />\nnecessary in a democratic society,\"<br />\nAfter a slow start the rally gained<br />\nmomentum as the speakers began to deal<br />\nseriously with a factual analysis of the<br />\nwar in Vietnam. S.D.S. provided the<br />\nmost outstanding speaker, Charles Capper who was so effective that during his<br />\nspeech the crowd listened silently. This<br />\nwas not so in the brief tenure of the<br />\nther speakers. They faced persistent<br />\nheckling reminiscent of the \"Foul<br />\nSpeech Movement' at BerkeleN. Perhaps<br />\nthe most unfortunate incident was the<br />\ndumping of water from a window in the<br />\nbuilding on to the podium. The perpetrator was identified as a member of<br />\nBeta Theta Pi Fraternity.<br />\nThe character of Monday's rally was<br />\nbest explained by a foreign exchange<br />\nstudent who attended. He said \"American<br />\ncollege boys have no political maturity.<br />\nThey make a panty raid out of a political rally.\" While much of the rally could<br />\nonly be seen in terms of a serious failure<br />\nin creating a much needed dialogue<br />\nwithin the Hopkins Community, it can<br />\nbe said with certainty that the rally accomplished much of its purpose.<br /><br />\nAn estimated crowd of 350 persons<br />\ngathered in Wyman Quadrangle last<br />\nWednesday night following a nationwide foreign policy speech by President<br />\nJohnson to attend a rally sponsored by<br />\nthe Students for a Democratic Society.<br />\nNotable among those who spoke out<br />\nagainst the administration's policy in<br />\nSouth Viet Nam was Steve Weissman,<br />\na graduate student at the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Berkeley and co-leader of<br />\nthe recent Free Speech movement on<br />\nthat campus.<br />\nThe first speaker at the hour-long<br />\nrally was Dr. Waldo Heinrichs, a professor in the Hopkins department of<br />\nhistory and a specialist in Far-Fa-stern<br />\naffairs. He stated that \"we must not<br />\nbe laggards in the search for peace,\"<br />\nand that the current escalation of the<br />\nwar can only lead to a confrontation<br />\nwith other major powers. Emphasizing<br />\nthe need for diversity in the world,<br />\nProfessor Heinrichs said: \"We want<br />\nboth an independent North Viet Nam<br />\nand an independent South Viet Nam,<br />\neach able to develop in its own way.\"<br />\nIn a consideration of President Johnson's proposal for a billion dollar aid<br />\nprogram for Southeast Asia, the professor registered his strong approval of<br />\nsuch a measure, although he feels that<br />\nit should be accompanied with a plan<br />\nfor negotiations. \"The President must<br /><br />\n'IR<br /><br />\n1/4<br /><br />\nrealize that force will not accomplish<br />\nhis objectives,\" Heinrichs said, and that<br />\nfurther attacks on North Viet Nam will<br />\nonly push the country closer to Red<br />\nChina. \"We must be prepared to compromise,\" he concluded. (Professor<br />\nHeinrichs outlined a possible plan for<br />\nnegotiation and withdrawal in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter.)<br />\nCharles Capper, spokesman for Hopkins SDS, followed Heinrichs. In answer to some observers who had burst<br />\nforth mockingly with strains from \"The<br />\nStar-Spangled Banner,\" Capper retorted: \"We are trying to seek rational<br />\nalternatives. You do not do this by<br />\nsinging chants which close off ears to<br />\nall alternatives.\"<br />\nAs he did at the rally held last Monday following the appearance at Hopkins of McGeorge Bundy, Capper briefly examined and evaluated the United<br />\nStates' position in South Viet Nam since<br />\n1954, explaining that, contrary to the<br />\nadministration's contention, the Viet<br />\nCong is an \"indigenous insurgency of<br />\nSouth Vietnamese against Americansupported dictators.\"<br />\nCapper announced that an estimated<br />\n1500 persons will participate in a March<br />\non Washington April 17 to protest the<br />\npresent policy in Viet Nam.

From the areas<br />\nthey now control? Dr. Heinrichs<br />\nsays NO. From North Vietnam?<br />\nI do not think he means that<br />\neither. This is as confusing as a<br />\npassage in the first paragraph.<br />\n\"The trouble with our policy is<br />\nthat it offers the other side no<br />\nalternative. . .\" What does Dr.<br />\nHeinrichs mean by -The other \u2022<br />\nside\"?<br />\nIt appears that he has not defined the other side sufficiently.<br />\n(I call this side: Red China and<br />\nCommunism.) Nowhere does Dr.<br />\nHeinrichs mention as to what<br />\nthe communist's real interests<br />\nare in the disputed areas.
