XVI, NO. 28.<br />\n<br />\nPLANS MATURING<br />\nDetails of Senior Week Festivities Taking Form in Hands of Committee.<br />\nWeyforth, Valedictorian.<br />\n<br />\nThe work of the Senior Week<br />\nCommittee has been chiefly directed<br />\ntoward completing the program for<br />\nthe Class Day exercises, which will<br />\ntake place in McCoy Hall on Monday afternoon, June m. A special<br />\ncommittee consisting of Messrs.<br />\nH. Graham Dubois, Ellis Miller,<br />\nJohn K. Burgan and Lindsay<br />\nRogers has been working in cooperation with the main committee<br />\nupon the literary features of the<br />\noccasion. The program, so far as<br />\ncompleted, will contain two addresses, an elaborate play written<br />\nfor the occasion in verse, a dramatic sketch of a different character and a number of musical and<br />\nhumorous features whose nature<br />\nthe committee prefers not to divulge.<br />\nAt a meeting of the class held<br />\n\" for the purpose some time ago, Dr.<br />\nJohn C. French was unanimously<br />\nelected honorary president of the<br />\nclass and invited to deliver the<br />\nopening or salutatory address. The<br />\naction was taken as a tribute to<br />\nDr. French's personal popularity<br />\nand in recognition of his enthusiastic and helpful support of the<br />\nSenior Week movement. The valedictory address will be made by<br />\nMr. William 0. Weyforth, who<br />\nwas unanimously chosen for that<br />\nhonor. The play is from the<br />\nskilled pen of,Mr. Dubois, whose<br />\nsuccess as a poet and writer of<br />\nfiction is well known. Besides<br />\nbeing of real literary merit, it contains such an abundance of local<br />\ncolor and pointed references that it<br />\nis certain to be hugely enjoyed by<br />\neveryone. .<br />\nAlthough not all the exams are<br />\nover by Wednesday, June 5, the<br />\nseniors will have completed theirs<br />\nand be at leisure to enjoy the dean's<br />\ndinner, which will probably be'<br />\ngiven that night at the club.<br />\nThe next day, when everybody's<br />\nexams are over, and even the<br />\n\u2018`grad\" students are feeling kittenish, will come off one of the most<br />\nimportant events in Senior Week-the prom. Mr. Easter, who is managing the dance, anounced Friday<br />\nthat tickets would be two dollars<br />\nand a half apiece, or fifty cents less<br />\nthan they usually are. This, however, means that there .must: \u2022be<br />\nevery bit as many people there as<br />\nat the cotillon. The seniors have<br />\nstarted the ball rolling; but they<br />\ncan't keep it rolling unless all the<br />\nfellows in the undergraduate body<br />\ngive the movement their undivided<br />\nsupport.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAY 20, 1912.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 With the fellows in white trousers and the fairies flitting across the<br />\n\"campus,\" Garden street, with its<br />\nlamp posts decorated with Japanese lanterns, ought to present a<br />\nsight unrivalled in the history of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nThe tickets for the boat ride on<br />\nFriday have been distributed among<br />\nthe lower classes, and will be distributed among the alumni, graduate and medical students at an early<br />\ndate this week. The stops which<br />\nthe \"Annapolis\" will make have<br />\nnot been decided upon, but it is<br />\nunderstood that a petition is being<br />\ngotten up in LeveripP: Hall to make<br />\nFlood's one of them.<br />\nSaturday 'a fterndon will see many<br />\ncurious stunts at Homewood.

Many<br />\nof the fellows have offered to stir<br />\nup enthusiasm to make sure that<br />\nthe revival of spirit will be a true<br />\nrevival.<br />\nTuesday night is the president's<br />\nreception, which delightful occasion<br />\nwill be much more delightful this<br />\nyear, after such a week of jollity,<br />\ncamaraderie and good-fellowship.<br />\nSuch a program makes sure that<br />\nno senior can leave college without<br />\nexclaiming: \"Long live our alma<br />\nmater !\" The day of disinterested<br />\nalumni is over.<br />\n1914 Hullabaloo Meets.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hullabaloo Board of 1914<br />\nwas called together last week for<br />\nits first meeting by A. L. Hammond, the editor-in-chief. Matters<br />\nrelating to the voting\u2022 of the Board,<br />\nmethods of finance and other broad<br />\ntopics were touched upon. Nothing of vital importance was decided,.because of the length of time<br />\nstill remaining before the publication of the book. The next meeting is to be early next year.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nLEE ELECTED<br />\n-----<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS DOWNS ST.

Freddie Lee was<br />\nelected president of the Association<br />\nfor the coming year, after a close<br />\ncontest with C. Leland Getz, the<br />\nother candidate.<br />\nLee's election has been met with<br />\nby approval from all sides, as he<br />\nis considered a man most capable<br />\nfor the position. His experience as<br />\nsenior .delegate this year and as<br />\n. captain of the track team should<br />\nhave given him all .the training<br />\nnecessary to make a first-rate president. \"Butts\" Sutton was elected<br />\nvice-president and George Gillet<br />\ncorresponding secretary of the<br />\nBoard. Ben Tappan was elected<br />\ndelegate froin the Medical School<br />\nand Eddie Hulburt was chosen t:.)<br />\nbe representative from the graduate students. No election for alumni delegate was necessary, as there<br />\nwas no one nominated to oppose<br />\n\u2022 \"Father Bill\" Schmeisser, whose<br />\nthree years' term expired this year.<br />\nThere are few other men who spend<br />\nso much time upon and take such<br />\ninterest in Hopkins athletics as Bill<br />\nSchmeisser, and it is a matter of<br />\ncongratulation for ourselves that he<br />\nwas re-elected unanimously.<br />\nBy a motion, passed at the beginning of the meeting, the constitution was amended so that there<br />\nwill be from this time on three<br />\nrepresentatives from the senior<br />\nclass, two from the junior and one<br />\nfrom the sophomore, instead of<br />\ntwo from the senior and one each<br />\nfrom the junior and sophomore<br />\nclasses.<br />\nAccording to the new system,<br />\nthe senior delegates elei&ed were<br />\nErnest J. Pieper, Julian D. Sears<br />\nand Embry H. Niles, all of whom<br />\nare members of 'varsity Jeams.<br />\nFrom the junior class Guy T. 0.<br />\nHollyday and Pete Porter were<br />\nelected, and from the sophomores<br />\nTommy Trokall.<br />\nThe election, on the \u2022whole, was<br />\nvery closely contested in every<br />\noffice and an unusually large vote<br />\nwas cast.<br />\nThe following is a detailed report<br />\nof the voting:<br />\nFor President\u2014Lee,81 ; Getz,.65.<br />\nFor Vice-President\u2014Sutton, 85 ;<br />\nHuck, 2.<br />\nFor 'Corresponding Secretary\u2014<br />\nGillet, 8o; Brown, 36;.Catlin',.3i.<br />\nFor Medical School Delegate\u2014<br />\nTappan, 61; -Horrax, 48; -Morton, 35.<br />\n(Conhnued on page 5, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\nPieper's steady pitching and the<br />\nfine support accorded him by his<br />\nteam mates enabled Hopkins to give<br />\nSt. John's a sound drubbing last<br />\nSaturday at Homewood.<br />\nThe<br />\nscore was 7 to I. Although Tolson, the St. John's twirler, struck<br />\nout fifteen men, he gave seven<br />\npasses and the seven Hopkins hits<br />\nwere made at times when hits meant<br />\nruns. Pieper was in fine form and<br />\nallowed only two hits. St. John's<br />\nlone tally was made by Hightman<br />\nin the second inning, when he<br />\nclouted one of Pieper's shoots to<br />\ndeep left field for a home run.<br />\nHopkins started in to win the<br />\ngame from the very beginning.<br />\nTolson struck out Porter, the first<br />\nHopkins batter, but then walked<br />\nOber, Williams and Hobbs, filling<br />\nthe bases. Ober and \u2022Williams<br />\ncrossed the plate on Pieper's single<br />\nto right field. Hobbs tallied in the<br />\nthird in<br />\nwhen Thompson<br />\nmissed a single to right field, which<br />\nrolled under the fence.<br />\nW. Smith beat out a bunt in the<br />\nsixth session and stole second, he<br />\nscored on Ober's single to left field.<br />\nHopkins tallied again in the seventh<br />\ninning and made its last run in the<br />\neighth; period.<br />\nThe Hopkins outfielders \u2022 played<br />\nfine ball. They have played phenommally all season, and are without a doubt the best college trio<br />\nin the State. Hopkins is the only<br />\nMaryland nine which has a clean<br />\nslate for the Maryland intercollegiate championship. Although Hopkins has only played Western<br />\nTaryland, Maryland Agricultural<br />\nCollege and St. John's, it disposed<br />\nof each of these in short order.<br />\nSt. John's had about as clear a title<br />\nto the Maryland championship as<br />\nany of the State colleges and so<br />\nHopkins' victory ought to undoubtedly make the Black and Blue nine<br />\nthe Maryland intercollegiate baseball champions.<br />\nSummary:<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS.<br />\nAll.

XVI, NO. 28.<br /><br />\nPLANS MATURING<br />\nDetails of Senior Week Festivities Taking Form in Hands of Committee.<br />\nWeyforth, Valedictorian.<br /><br />\nThe work of the Senior Week<br />\nCommittee has been chiefly directed<br />\ntoward completing the program for<br />\nthe Class Day exercises, which will<br />\ntake place in McCoy Hall on Monday afternoon, June m. A special<br />\ncommittee consisting of Messrs.<br />\nH. Graham Dubois, Ellis Miller,<br />\nJohn K. Burgan and Lindsay<br />\nRogers has been working in cooperation with the main committee<br />\nupon the literary features of the<br />\noccasion. The program, so far as<br />\ncompleted, will contain two addresses, an elaborate play written<br />\nfor the occasion in verse, a dramatic sketch of a different character and a number of musical and<br />\nhumorous features whose nature<br />\nthe committee prefers not to divulge.<br />\nAt a meeting of the class held<br />\n\" for the purpose some time ago, Dr.<br />\nJohn C. French was unanimously<br />\nelected honorary president of the<br />\nclass and invited to deliver the<br />\nopening or salutatory address. The<br />\naction was taken as a tribute to<br />\nDr. French's personal popularity<br />\nand in recognition of his enthusiastic and helpful support of the<br />\nSenior Week movement. The valedictory address will be made by<br />\nMr. William 0. Weyforth, who<br />\nwas unanimously chosen for that<br />\nhonor. The play is from the<br />\nskilled pen of,Mr. Dubois, whose<br />\nsuccess as a poet and writer of<br />\nfiction is well known. Besides<br />\nbeing of real literary merit, it contains such an abundance of local<br />\ncolor and pointed references that it<br />\nis certain to be hugely enjoyed by<br />\neveryone. .<br />\nAlthough not all the exams are<br />\nover by Wednesday, June 5, the<br />\nseniors will have completed theirs<br />\nand be at leisure to enjoy the dean's<br />\ndinner, which will probably be'<br />\ngiven that night at the club.<br />\nThe next day, when everybody's<br />\nexams are over, and even the<br />\n\u2018`grad\" students are feeling kittenish, will come off one of the most<br />\nimportant events in Senior Week-the prom. Mr. Easter, who is managing the dance, anounced Friday<br />\nthat tickets would be two dollars<br />\nand a half apiece, or fifty cents less<br />\nthan they usually are. This, however, means that there .must: \u2022be<br />\nevery bit as many people there as<br />\nat the cotillon. The seniors have<br />\nstarted the ball rolling; but they<br />\ncan't keep it rolling unless all the<br />\nfellows in the undergraduate body<br />\ngive the movement their undivided<br />\nsupport.<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAY 20, 1912.<br /><br />\n\u2022 With the fellows in white trousers and the fairies flitting across the<br />\n\"campus,\" Garden street, with its<br />\nlamp posts decorated with Japanese lanterns, ought to present a<br />\nsight unrivalled in the history of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nThe tickets for the boat ride on<br />\nFriday have been distributed among<br />\nthe lower classes, and will be distributed among the alumni, graduate and medical students at an early<br />\ndate this week. The stops which<br />\nthe \"Annapolis\" will make have<br />\nnot been decided upon, but it is<br />\nunderstood that a petition is being<br />\ngotten up in LeveripP: Hall to make<br />\nFlood's one of them.<br />\nSaturday 'a fterndon will see many<br />\ncurious stunts at Homewood. Impromptu lacrosse and baseball<br />\ngames have a prominent part on theprogram.<br />\nSaturday night witnesses a dinner<br />\non \"the shore,\" probably at Thompson's.<br />\nSunday the seniors and their<br />\nfriends will hear a baccalaureate<br />\nsermon ; letters have .been written<br />\nto many prominent clergymen, but,<br />\nas yet, they have not made any<br />\nfinal arrangements.<br />\nPresident Remsen's luncheon is<br />\nto be held On Monday, probably at<br />\none o'clock.<br />\n\u2022 Though the committee has made<br />\nno definite plans for Monday night,<br />\nthey can be relied upon not to<br />\nallow any anti-climax to mar the<br />\ngeometrical progression of pleasure.<br />\n\u2022 Tuesday is to be Commencement Day, when a large attendance<br />\nof lusty-lunged undergraduates is<br />\nexpected at the Academy. Many<br />\nof the fellows have offered to stir<br />\nup enthusiasm to make sure that<br />\nthe revival of spirit will be a true<br />\nrevival.<br />\nTuesday night is the president's<br />\nreception, which delightful occasion<br />\nwill be much more delightful this<br />\nyear, after such a week of jollity,<br />\ncamaraderie and good-fellowship.<br />\nSuch a program makes sure that<br />\nno senior can leave college without<br />\nexclaiming: \"Long live our alma<br />\nmater !\" The day of disinterested<br />\nalumni is over.<br />\n1914 Hullabaloo Meets.<br /><br />\nThe Hullabaloo Board of 1914<br />\nwas called together last week for<br />\nits first meeting by A. L. Hammond, the editor-in-chief. Matters<br />\nrelating to the voting\u2022 of the Board,<br />\nmethods of finance and other broad<br />\ntopics were touched upon. Nothing of vital importance was decided,.because of the length of time<br />\nstill remaining before the publication of the book.

Freddie Lee was<br />\nelected president of the Association<br />\nfor the coming year, after a close<br />\ncontest with C. Leland Getz, the<br />\nother candidate.<br />\nLee's election has been met with<br />\nby approval from all sides, as he<br />\nis considered a man most capable<br />\nfor the position. His experience as<br />\nsenior .delegate this year and as<br />\n. captain of the track team should<br />\nhave given him all .the training<br />\nnecessary to make a first-rate president. \"Butts\" Sutton was elected<br />\nvice-president and George Gillet<br />\ncorresponding secretary of the<br />\nBoard. Ben Tappan was elected<br />\ndelegate froin the Medical School<br />\nand Eddie Hulburt was chosen t:.)<br />\nbe representative from the graduate students. No election for alumni delegate was necessary, as there<br />\nwas no one nominated to oppose<br />\n\u2022 \"Father Bill\" Schmeisser, whose<br />\nthree years' term expired this year.<br />\nThere are few other men who spend<br />\nso much time upon and take such<br />\ninterest in Hopkins athletics as Bill<br />\nSchmeisser, and it is a matter of<br />\ncongratulation for ourselves that he<br />\nwas re-elected unanimously.<br />\nBy a motion, passed at the beginning of the meeting, the constitution was amended so that there<br />\nwill be from this time on three<br />\nrepresentatives from the senior<br />\nclass, two from the junior and one<br />\nfrom the sophomore, instead of<br />\ntwo from the senior and one each<br />\nfrom the junior and sophomore<br />\nclasses.<br />\nAccording to the new system,<br />\nthe senior delegates elei&amp;ed were<br />\nErnest J. Pieper, Julian D. Sears<br />\nand Embry H. Niles, all of whom<br />\nare members of 'varsity Jeams.<br />\nFrom the junior class Guy T. 0.<br />\nHollyday and Pete Porter were<br />\nelected, and from the sophomores<br />\nTommy Trokall.<br />\nThe election, on the \u2022whole, was<br />\nvery closely contested in every<br />\noffice and an unusually large vote<br />\nwas cast.<br />\nThe following is a detailed report<br />\nof the voting:<br />\nFor President\u2014Lee,81 ; Getz,.65.<br />\nFor Vice-President\u2014Sutton, 85 ;<br />\nHuck, 2.<br />\nFor 'Corresponding Secretary\u2014<br />\nGillet, 8o; Brown, 36;.Catlin',.3i.<br />\nFor Medical School Delegate\u2014<br />\nTappan, 61; -Horrax, 48; -Morton, 35.<br />\n(Conhnued on page 5, col. 3.)<br /><br />\nPieper's steady pitching and the<br />\nfine support accorded him by his<br />\nteam mates enabled Hopkins to give<br />\nSt. John's a sound drubbing last<br />\nSaturday at Homewood.<br />\nThe<br />\nscore was 7 to I. Although Tolson, the St. John's twirler, struck<br />\nout fifteen men, he gave seven<br />\npasses and the seven Hopkins hits<br />\nwere made at times when hits meant<br />\nruns. Pieper was in fine form and<br />\nallowed only two hits. St. John's<br />\nlone tally was made by Hightman<br />\nin the second inning, when he<br />\nclouted one of Pieper's shoots to<br />\ndeep left field for a home run.<br />\nHopkins started in to win the<br />\ngame from the very beginning.<br />\nTolson struck out Porter, the first<br />\nHopkins batter, but then walked<br />\nOber, Williams and Hobbs, filling<br />\nthe bases. Ober and \u2022Williams<br />\ncrossed the plate on Pieper's single<br />\nto right field. Hobbs tallied in the<br />\nthird in<br />\nwhen Thompson<br />\nmissed a single to right field, which<br />\nrolled under the fence.<br />\nW. Smith beat out a bunt in the<br />\nsixth session and stole second, he<br />\nscored on Ober's single to left field.<br />\nHopkins tallied again in the seventh<br />\ninning and made its last run in the<br />\neighth; period.<br />\nThe Hopkins outfielders \u2022 played<br />\nfine ball. They have played phenommally all season, and are without a doubt the best college trio<br />\nin the State. Hopkins is the only<br />\nMaryland nine which has a clean<br />\nslate for the Maryland intercollegiate championship. Although Hopkins has only played Western<br />\nTaryland, Maryland Agricultural<br />\nCollege and St. John's, it disposed<br />\nof each of these in short order.<br />\nSt. John's had about as clear a title<br />\nto the Maryland championship as<br />\nany of the State colleges and so<br />\nHopkins' victory ought to undoubtedly make the Black and Blue nine<br />\nthe Maryland intercollegiate baseball champions.<br />\nSummary:<br /><br />\nHOPKINS.<br />\nAll.
