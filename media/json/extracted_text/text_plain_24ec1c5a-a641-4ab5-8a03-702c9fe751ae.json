We are<br />\nconvinced that imaginative building attracts imagination in funding,<br />\nin use, and in discovery of new<br />\nroles....At this pass our concern<br />\nis not so much with bricks and<br />\nmortar as with bricks and imagination.\"<br />\nWith these words, three Hop-<br />\n<br />\nRichard Macksey: \"We lost some tennis<br />\ncourts and I'm not sure what we gained.\"<br />\n<br />\nkins professors ended a letter to<br />\nPresident Gordon, dated October<br />\n1, 1967, a letter which was never<br />\nanswered, outlining a number of<br />\nproposals for reexamining \"the<br />\narchitectural definition of the University's future.\" The letter came<br />\nto the attention of the NewsLetter only last week.<br />\nIn a three-part proposal, the<br />\nmen, Drs. Richard Macksey, Stephen Wolff and Harry Woolf envisioned a new quadrangle in the<br />\narea southwest of Barton Hall.<br />\nThe proposal called for:<br />\n1. A major architectural competition to design the new<br />\nquad, as well as plan for the<br />\nfuture development of Wyman Park.<br />\n2. The renewal of the Urban<br />\nPlanning Conferences with a<br />\nview toward including both<br />\nthe community and major outside scholars in Homewood's<br />\nfuture development. The Conferences have not been held<br />\nsince the 1940's.<br />\n3. The publication of the<br />\nwinning architectural designs<br />\nand the papers of the planning conference by the Johns<br />\nHopkins Press.<br />\nThe three men, along with<br />\nDr. John White, were invited to<br />\nspeak at a meeting of the Trus-<br />\n<br />\ntees' Buildings and Grounds Committee, but the substance of the<br />\nletter was not responded to, either<br />\nthen or later. \"More than a year<br />\nafter that,\" Dr. Macksey stated,<br />\n\"the President passed Harry<br />\n(Woolf) in the Faculty Club and<br />\nsaid he had gotten his letter.<br />\nbut unfortunately they had already broken ground on the new<br />\nadministration building.\"<br />\nThe building, to be named<br />\nGarland Hall, has been dubbed<br />\n\"Fort Gordon\" by Dr. Macksey.<br />\nDr. White commented that the<br />\nnew building \"would have been<br />\na bad one in the 1930's. In the<br />\n.1970's, it's appalling.\"<br />\nThe architectural consultant<br />\nfor the campus, a New York<br />\nfirm named Rapuano and Clark,<br />\nhas ultimate say over all construction and landscaping. According<br />\nto Macksey and Wolff, the consultants were the only ones hostile<br />\nto their idea.<br />\n\"Apparently,\" stated Macksey, \"they didn't like the competition part. They wanted the<br />\nultimate say, and it seems that<br />\nalmost every building on campus<br />\nhas been designed by local Baltimore architects.\"<br />\n\"Except for Homewood<br />\nHouse and Embryology,\" cornmented Dr. White, \"there is not a<br />\n<br />\nsingle decent building on campus.<br />\nThe Georgian Style relies upon<br />\nbeauty of proportion and fineness of detail\u2014the idea that you<br />\ncan put up a Georgian building<br />\nin 1970 for a laboratory seems<br />\nto me weird if not crazy.\"<br />\nDr. Wolff elaborated further:<br />\n\"They said that the Administration Building would be Georgian<br />\nin style. Then they told us it<br />\nwould have five stories, and would<br />\nuse concrete instead of marble<br />\nand would have a flat roof. Now<br />\nit has no windows. In sum, it will<br />\nbe a large brick box.\"<br />\n\"I get depressed,\" Dr. Macksey said, \"because, in a sense, this<br />\nnew fortress is the bad beginning<br />\nof a new quad. We wanted at<br />\nleast one or two decent buildings.<br />\nAs it is now, we lost some tennis<br />\ncourts and I'm not sure what we<br />\ngained.\"<br />\nDr. White, Chairman of the<br />\nHistory of Art Department, was<br />\nparticularly vehement. \"Look,<br />\nyou will not get any where until<br />\nyou raise your sights.

A two dollar registration fee had<br />\nbeen charged by the BFU expressly to<br />\ncover the cost of the catalogue.<br />\n<br />\nBoth parties share the blame for what<br />\nhappened--the Free University because<br />\nof its loose informal administrative<br />\nstructure, and the Aquarian Age Bookstore, for taking advantage of this structure to serve its own ends.<br />\nBennett Hoffman defended the policy of<br />\ncharging money. \"We're not out to make<br />\nmoney. Our main object is making these<br />\nteachings available to those who are interested in them.If the people who have to<br />\nteach need money, then they have to get<br />\npaid. We also need money for professional lecturers, and visual aids.<br />\n\"We didn't really break away. Our<br />\ncourses can still be listed in the Free<br />\nUniversity catalogue, if they want to, but<br />\nthey hare to be run the way that we want<br />\nthem to be. These courses are very im-<br />\n<br />\nportant to us.\"<br />\nThe head of the BFU, Dennis Krohn, a<br />\njunior, is pessimistic about the future.<br />\n\"What is needed is the judgement of more<br />\nthan one person to run the organization.<br />\nBesides me, there is no one interested in<br />\ncontinuing with the administration of the<br />\nFree University.\"<br />\nKrohn objected to the, introduction of<br />\nmoney last semester into the BFU.\"Nice<br />\nthing about being free is that you're flexible. When you start dealing with money,<br />\nyou have to utilize certain rigorous procedures.\"<br />\n\"The Aquarians were trying to further<br />\nthe esoteric cause, and saw the Free<br />\nUniversity as a viable place to do it. But<br />\nthe BFU was at a weak point and couldn't<br />\nwithstand such an attack.\"<br />\n<br />\nDennis Khrone. current head of the Free<br />\nUniversity. is pessimistic about its future.<br />\n<br />\nDepartmental Governance Proposed<br />\n<br />\nCharged Rent<br />\nA system of governance using the department as its basic unit has been proposed by Dr. Eliezer Naddor of Operations Research.<br />\n<br />\nUnable to get rooms for teaching at<br />\nHopkins, the Aquarians rented space from<br />\na local Theosophical Society, charging<br />\nstudents at the classes,to cover the rent.<br />\nA confidential source claimed that the<br />\nAquarians where taking in more than<br />\nneeded to pay the rent--in effect, profiting from the Free University. At the<br />\nsame time, the bookstore served as the<br />\nunofficial switchboard for the whole Free<br />\nUniversity, giving out information on all<br />\nthe courses taught.<br />\nAn ensuing confrontation between the<br />\nBFU organizers and the Aquarians over<br />\nthe practice of charging for classes has<br />\ncaused the Aquarians to withdraw all their<br />\ncourses. They are now in the process of<br />\nestablishing the Aquarian University of<br />\nMaryland, which according to Bennett<br />\nHoffman, one of the Bookstore's owners<br />\nwill be the first such institution devoted<br />\nentirely to esoteric knowledge in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\n<br />\nExpressing his interest in methods, not<br />\nin issues, Professor Naddor's planwould<br />\nprovide what he calls a \"better flow of<br />\ninformation\" among members of the Hopkins community.<br />\nUnder this proposal, every student<br />\nwould choose a department, including<br />\nthose with cross-disciplinary majors.<br />\nWithin each department, students,faculty<br />\nand graduate students would elect representatives to councils of peer groups.<br />\nThese peer groups--separate councils of<br />\nstudents, grad students, and faculty-- together comprise a University Senate.<br />\n<br />\n'Monthly Meetings<br />\nDr. Eliezer Naddor has proposed that the department be the basic unit of a new governance system.<br />\n<br />\nOnce a month, each department would<br />\nhold a meeting, where all members dis-<br />\n<br />\ncuss whatever issues are considered<br />\nimportant. Council representatives could<br />\nbe instructed how to vote on certain matters. The representatives can be impeached at any time.<br />\n<br />\nStanding Committee<br />\nIn order to deal with large issues, the<br />\nSenate would have a standing committee,<br />\nmade up of representatives from all the<br />\n\"sub-councils\", with the responsibility<br />\nto canvas opinions throughout the Hopkins community, and, if necessary, local<br />\ncommunity, city and state opinions.<br />\nAlso included on the University Senate will be representatives of the Administration and the non-professional<br />\nemployees.<br />\nProfessor Naddor said that he had not<br />\nworked all of the details of his plan yet,<br />\nbut has received favorable comments on<br />\nit from other members of the faculty.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council Parking Proposals Rejected<br />\nBy MARC KRIZACK<br />\nThe University Parking and Traffic<br />\nCommittee has unanimously voted down<br />\nthe Student Council proposals to improve<br />\nthe parking facilities on campus.<br />\nHarry Singleton, chairman of the Student Council Task Force on Facilities<br />\nwhich studied the parking situation, has<br />\ncharged the faculty and administration of<br />\nshort-changing the students. \"When the<br />\nfaculty and administration need more<br />\nspace,\" said Singleton, \"it gets taken<br />\nfrom the students.\"<br />\nThe Student Councils' proposals were<br />\nboth long-range and short-range. One of<br />\nthe long-range proposals called for an<br />\nend to segregated parking by September<br />\nof 1970. Singleton said that all parking<br />\nareas should be open to anyone with a<br />\npermit and not just to faculty or administration. \"The purpose of this,\"<br />\nsaid Singleton, \"is to make the faculty<br />\nfeel the pinch so they will bitch and<br />\nsomething will get done\".<br />\n<br />\nOne Way<br />\nThe other long-range proposal, also to<br />\nbe initiated by September 1970, was to<br />\nturn the road in front of the library into a<br />\none-way road going north with parking on<br />\nthe left-hand side.<br />\nDr. Carl Christ, chairman of the<br />\nUniversity Parking and Traffic Committee and professor of political economy, said that he had been advised by<br />\nWilliam Campbell of the Plant Manager's office that it would be too difficult to control a one-way traffic situation. Christ said that presently many<br />\npeople drive by the barricades which<br />\nare set up for special events.<br />\nChrist also said that faculty priority<br />\nparking is absolutely essential to the<br />\nfunctioning of the University.<br />\n<br />\nHe mentioned a number of instances<br />\nIn the past when a faculty member who<br />\ncould not find a parking space returned home. He said that if faculty were<br />\nforced to walk to campus, they would<br />\noften be late for classes.<br />\nThe other long-range proposal was<br />\nfor periodic checks to be made to insure that permits are being issued<br />\nwhich met the approval of the University Committee.<br />\n<br />\nPark Anywhere<br />\nOne of the short-range proposals was<br />\nfor an immediate reduction ot fines.<br />\nSingleton said that this was intortant<br />\n<br />\nfor seniors who will have to pay huge<br />\nsums, as much as $300 in some cases,<br />\nbefore they can graduate.<br />\nThe proposal for the reduction of<br />\nfines would have allowed those students<br />\nwith fines totaling over $25 to pay 20%<br />\nof that total. Dr. Christ said that this<br />\nwas unacceptable to his committee because, in his words, \"it would be like<br />\ntelling people they could park anywhere.\"<br />\nSingleton said that employees as well<br />\nas students have complained about the<br />\nheavy fines, pointing out that an employee's fines are taken out of his pay.<br />\nSingleton said that the Student Council<br />\nalso proposed a reduction of ticketing<br />\n<br />\nand towing for all except flagrant violations. These include the blocking of<br />\nroads and loading ramps and speeding.<br />\nThe University Committee did take<br />\nsome action towards reducing fines at<br />\nIts meeting April 23, when it was decided that only the first offense of nonregistered cars parked on campus will<br />\nresult in a $25 fine. Subsequent violations will result in a lesser fine of<br />\n$5 or $10. Presently each offense is a<br />\n$25 fine. Registered cars parked illegally will result in a fine of $3-$5.<br />\nSingleton said that \"the whole thing<br />\n(parking) really revolves around governance.\" He noted that only two students<br />\nare members of the University Committee.<br />\n<br />\nCISF Finds Landlords Cooperative<br />\nAs a result of a survey begun in February, the Committee for Improving Student Facilities has issued its report calling for a central housing agency for the<br />\nwhole university.<br />\nWith almost 225 responses the members of the committee tabulated figures<br />\nconcerning rents per apartments, rent<br />\nper capita, location, overall condition,<br />\ncooperativeness of landlords. The purpose of the report was originally toprovide information to freshman about<br />\napartments, but it spread to suggestions<br />\nconcerning all facts of undergraduate<br />\nhousing.<br />\nRents for furnished apartments surveyed ranged from $40 to $280 per<br />\nmonth, the report asserted. Unfurnished rooms went from $45 to $225<br />\nper month. The majority of furnished<br />\nrooms cost from $100 to $165, while<br />\nmost unfurnished rooms cost from $100<br />\nto $165, while most unfurnished ones<br />\n<br />\ncentered around $145.

In his statement Monday, Dean-Elect George Benton<br />\nstated that these signaNEWS<br />\ntures were sufficient<br />\nreason for him to hold<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\na referendum.<br />\nThe SOU was formed as a coalition of<br />\nthree separate groups that had individually been working to oppose the Thursday night decision to end recruiting.<br />\nThe first group formed at the Young Republicans meeting Thursday night when<br />\nnews of Gordon's decision arrived. Led<br />\nby undergrad Gil Morris, they met at<br />\nnoon the following day w ith a second group,<br />\ncomposed of Dr. James Carpenter of<br />\nOceanography and grad students Wes<br />\nBradford and Michael Loftus. A petition<br />\nwritten by Carpenter calling for a referendum had already collected two hundred signatures.<br />\n<br />\nThis united group then drafted a letter<br />\nto Dr. Benton asking him not to agree to<br />\nany further demands under the \"threat of<br />\nviolence.\" Bradford stated that he was<br />\nafraid that the strikers would become<br />\n\"internally catalytic\" and might turn<br />\nto violence. \"The strikers were really<br />\nuptight,\" claimed Bradford.<br />\nBy Sunday, the petition had gathered<br />\nover 800 signatures. At a meeting that<br />\nday, the pro-recruitment group was joined by another group of undergrads that<br />\nhad been drafting a statement opposing<br />\nthe recruitment ban. After some editing,<br />\nthe group adopted the statement and signed \"Students for an Open University.\"<br />\nThe statement, entitled \"We Dissent,\"<br />\nstated that \"the University must be open<br />\nto all opinions and recruitment efforts.<br />\n<br />\nTo abridge the rights of one group is<br />\nto endanger the rights of all.\" It was<br />\nupon these principles that SOU based<br />\ntheir referendum campaign.<br />\n<br />\n\"Dissent 2\"<br />\nAfter Benton decided to hold the referendum, SOU bent their efforts towards urging people to vote military<br />\nrecruitment back on campus. In \"Dissent 2\", a statement published on Wednesday, SOU denied that voting in favor<br />\nof recruitment was tantamount to sup-<br />\n<br />\nport of the Vietnam war. It also pointed<br />\nout that no recruiting, claimed the statement, is a purely informational activity<br />\non campus.<br />\nWhile the group disagrees with the<br />\nStrike Corn mittee on the issue of recruitment, it is in agreement with the principle<br />\nthat the University is in need of a new<br />\ngovernance system. SOU is trying to<br />\nformulate a policy on governance and to<br />\ndiscuss with the strikers the possibility<br />\nof presenting a united front on governance. An informal meeting with the strikers and the Academic Council on Tues-<br />\n<br />\nday evening produced nothing conclusive.<br />\nBradford emphasized that SOU members were in no way supporters of the<br />\nwar. \"However,\" stated Bradford,\" we<br />\ncould not see prostituting a basic right<br />\nlike free speech.\"<br />\nMost of the SOU membership, which<br />\nhas about 50-50 undergraduate-graduate<br />\ncomposition, are not political activists.<br />\nAroused over this one issue, they decided<br />\nto take action. Stated grad student Mimi<br />\nMinella, \"I felt that it was about time for<br />\nme to crawl out of the laboratory.\"<br />\n<br />\nVote Ends Military Recruiting<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nContinuing meetings have been held<br />\nover the past few days between Deandesignate Benton and the representatives of both sides. There has been<br />\nsome disagreement between Benton and<br />\nthe Strike Committee over the nature<br />\nof the talks. Benton claims that he made<br />\nit clear last Thursday night after the<br />\nagreement was reached on the recruitment issue that any further meetings<br />\nwould take the form of discussions.<br />\nHowever, the Strike Committee claims<br />\nthat it has been acting under the assumption that negotiations on the issue of<br />\ngovernance and APL were taking place.<br />\nRepresentatives of the Strike Committee and the Students for an OpenUniversity, along with Dr. Woodford Howard,<br />\nDr. John White and other administrative<br />\nand student officials met with the Academic Council in a closed, informal session Tuesday night to discuss the issue<br />\nof governance.<br />\nThough the meeting<br />\nproduced nothing substantive, the Strike<br />\nCommittee did present its general proposals for the basis of a new governance system. They did not meet with<br />\na great deal of opposition.<br />\nThe Strike Committee calls for \"all<br />\nsegments of the University\" to be represented on the ad hoc governance<br />\ncommittee. Benton has proposed that<br />\nsuch a committee work on the problem<br />\nover the summer. The Strike group<br />\nincludes non-administrative employees<br />\nin \"all-segments.\"<br />\nThe proposals call for the new method<br />\n<br />\nof governance to be ratified by either a<br />\nstraight one-man, one-vote referendum,<br />\nor on a vote within each segment with<br />\na two-thirds negative vote in any segment vetoing it. This point apparently<br />\ndrew the most fire from the Academic<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe Strike Committee held a noon<br />\nrally on Wednesday in front of Levering Hall. Following folk-singing entertainment, Drs. Pepper, Pfeffer and<br />\nothers addressed the crowd urging them<br />\nto vote no on the referendum. Pepper<br />\nsuggested that if recruiters were a lowed back on the basis of free speech, he<br />\n<br />\nwould set up a tie selling stand in Levering.<br />\nThe rally also saw the creation of a<br />\nnew group, the Community for a University Democracy, which attacked the<br />\nwording of the referendum and called for<br />\na write-in proposal simply declaring<br />\nthe campus open for recruitment by<br />\nanyone. The group drew three people<br />\nto a 4 p.m. meeting.<br />\nOtherwise, the main activity centered<br />\naround leafleting, telephoning and plastering the campus with signs as both<br />\nsides attempted to win the referendum.<br />\n<br />\nNew Council Is Elected<br />\nStudent Council and class officers were<br />\nelected on Tuesday and Wednesday of this<br />\nweek. Run-offs will be held early next<br />\nweek.<br />\n<br />\nclass office.

In retrospect<br />\nit often has brought up an important issue and had good<br />\npoints about it, but adopted a tone that made me throw up<br />\non first reading.\"<br />\nMany readers stated that the paper has a very noticeable bias towards the administration. One student commented, \"The picture of Gordon with a sneaking smile<br />\nwith the headline proclaiming he was sorry that the SC<br />\nwanted to dissolve itself was very biased.\"<br />\nAn overwhelming majority of the respondents said<br />\nthey thought the Tuesday issue was a worthwhile contribution to the campus. Also many said they would enjoy more human interest stories.<br />\n<br />\nThe poll revealed a serious split among the respondents over N-L editorial policy. Either the reader<br />\nseemed to like it or hate it. A little more than half expressed some to extreme displeasure with the editorials. The critics complained about the simplistic'<br />\nand belligerent tone of the editorials, while others found<br />\nthem generally responsible and well-thought-out.<br />\nGeneral comments ranged from \"Why not save the<br />\nschool some money and sack the N-L\" and \"The N-L<br />\nreeks\" to \"You are O.K. as you are\" and \"The N-L<br />\nhas improved immensely over the four years I've been<br />\nhere.<br />\nI heartily approve of two issues per week.\"<br />\nAnother respondent stated, \"I was particularly disappointed by the coverage of the last campus crisis.<br />\nThe News-Letter, as spokesman for the interests of<br />\nthe undergraduate body, should make a stronger effort<br />\nto represent all sides of opinion on campus matters.\"<br />\n<br />\nEditorial Split<br />\nMost<br />\nof the answers reflected approval of the<br />\nN-L's layout, but some noted it is sometimes hard to<br />\nread.<br />\n<br />\nA great majority of students wanted more sports<br />\ncoverage.

Perhaps this accounts for the naive attitude<br />\nwith which I entered Friday's meeting of the General Assembly of the Faculty.<br />\nI was optimistic, for I was under the illusion<br />\nthat the body there assembled represented not<br />\nonly the country's best-trained minds, but also<br />\nthe country's greatest minds. I thought that our<br />\nfaculty consisted of scholar-teachers, men who<br />\nare not only knowledgeable but also wise. I was<br />\nsorely disillusioned.<br />\nIt became evident that the Faculty desired a<br />\nmeeting as hermetically closed as the majority<br />\nof their minds, and that they resented student<br />\nattempts at open dialogue. Their response to two<br />\nstudents who tried to speak during the first half<br />\nof the meeting was one which betrayed their barbarism: the barbarism of the specialist, as Ortega would have it.<br />\nOur supposedly civilized professors of history,<br />\neconomics, political science, the natural sciences<br />\nand the humanities let their true selves be known<br />\nin a few minutes of cat-calls and shouts. The<br />\nmass mentality has pervaded both the upper reacches of government and the body of tenured academicians at Hopkins. Our faculty's monumental<br />\nrudeness to students became even more dramatically exposed when they began to leave en masse<br />\nafter students were finally given the floor.<br />\nThe root of the problem with the faculty at Hopkins lies in the fact that a man's ability as a teacher, his open-mindedness and his flexibility, his<br />\nconcern for students and his sense of responsibility toward the betterment of mankind, is not<br />\nevaluated or even investigated when considerations of the awarding of tenure are made.<br />\nA man is given tenure if he is nationally known<br />\nIn his field of specialization and if he publishes.<br />\nTeaching is deemed irrelevant at Hopkins, because of the mistaken assumption that the most<br />\nknowledgeable man is necessarily the best man.<br />\nFriday's meeting made it clear that he is not.<br />\nI propose that Hopkins neither promote nor grant<br />\ntenure to any scholar who has shown himself to<br />\nbe insufficiently concerned with teaching. A man's<br />\nquality as a teacher could be determined by departmental solicitation of confidential letters of<br />\nrecommendation from undergraduate majors and<br />\nthose majors who have graduated within two years.<br />\nThis would be otte step in bringing the university<br />\nup from barbarism and away from violence.<br />\n,Peterfrl.

This is completely erroneous.<br />\nOn April 9, 1970 several complaints were made<br />\nto the Office of Student Affairs that the Black Panthers were selling literature in Gilman Hall. The<br />\nonly action taken at this time was to telephone the<br />\nBlack Panther headquarters for two reasons:<br />\n1. To explain University policy which requires<br />\nsponsorship by a recognized campus activity or<br />\ngroup for any type of solicitation and which prohibits solicitation by any group within University<br />\nclassroom buildings with a few exceptions - Levering Hall, the lobby of Shriver Hall, etc.<br />\n2. To inform the Black Panthers that a campus organization, which this office contacted, was<br />\nwilling to sponsor them and to set up a station<br />\nfor them within Levering Hall or elsewhere if<br />\nthey so desired.<br />\nAt no time have the Black Panthers or any other<br />\ngroup been singled out on a discriminatory basis.<br />\nIn fact, the Black Panthers have participated<br />\nopenly and freely in programs on campus throughout, the year - without restrictions.<br />\nRobert P.

Rumors filter in on<br />\nthe busts of the Black Panthers all up<br />\n<br />\nDig It, Daddy-0: The Reissues Are Here<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nThe record industry has hit upon a profitable phenomenon: the reissue. An old<br />\nidea in classical music, it has recently<br />\nsurfaced to large extent in the fields of<br />\nPopular music. Two fields especially,<br />\nrock and blues.<br />\nPart I. In the last two years America<br />\nhas experienced (very mildly) what's<br />\nbeen called a Rock `n' Roll Revival Sha-na-na, Beatle parodies, magazine<br />\narticles on the Eisenhower decade, midiskirts. Atco Records has just released<br />\ntwo albums overflowing with superb examples of the black rhythm and blues<br />\nWhich spawned the white rock that's being revived today.The records are \"Rock<br />\nBegins\", Volumes One and Two.<br />\nHere it is, man,everything is here: the<br />\nscratchy tenor breaks,the \"0000 bop bop\"<br />\nChoruses in perfect harmony, the onedrum drumming. All you cats and chicks<br />\ncan get your kicks. Dig it, daddy-o.<br />\n<br />\nDon't Talk Back<br />\nVolume One features husky-voiced<br />\nbluesman Joe Turner singing \"Shake,<br />\nRattle and Roll\"(far superior to the cover<br />\nversions done by Bill Haley and the<br />\nComets and by Elvis Presley.) Released<br />\nin 1954, this tale of marital discord was<br />\nwritten by America's greatest unrecognized poet, Charles Calhoun. Sample<br />\nlyrics:<br />\nI'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a<br />\nseafood store<br />\nI'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a<br />\nseafood store<br />\nWell I can look at you till you ain't no<br />\nchild no more<br />\n(A triple negative in 1954. The bee's<br />\nknees.) Turner is also represented on this<br />\nrecord with his million-seller \"\u2018Corrina Corrina\", a fine thick vocal.<br />\nTo Volume One Ray Charles contributes a 6 1/2 minute version of his imblues-rock-jazz-gospel-Soulmortal<br />\nand-everything-else classic \"What'd I<br />\nSay.\" Other highlights of the album: the<br />\nCoasters' \"Yakety Yak\", one of the first<br />\nand one of the funniest of the generation<br />\ngap tunes; the Drifters' \"There Goes<br />\nMy Baby\"; a fantastic Ruth Brown vocal;<br />\n<br />\nand La Vern Baker telling her lover<br />\n\"you're as sweet as bubblegum\" (only<br />\nAS sweet, mind you). Unfortunately, the<br />\nrecord is marred by two Bobby Darin<br />\nrockers, an attempt to appeal to the<br />\n\"oldies\" market.<br />\n<br />\nBroke My Little Bottle<br />\nVolume Two of \"Rock Begins\" has the<br />\nearliest song in the series, the Clovers'<br />\n1952 \"One Mint Julep\". One of the most<br />\nunderrated groups of the period,the Clovers (biggest hit: \"Love Potion No. 9\"<br />\nIn 1959) deliver smooth renditions of two<br />\ntunes on this record.(They do a Charles<br />\nCalhoun song on Volume One.)0ther high<br />\nspots of the second volume are Ray Charles' \"I Got A Woman\" and \"Charlie<br />\nBrown\" by the still-performing Coasters.<br />\nAlso present are the Drifters, as consistently great in the '50's as the Shirelles<br />\nwere in the '60's. They are represented<br />\nby four songs, the two early ones (with<br />\nClyde McPhatter)inferior to the two later<br />\nones (without Clyde McPhatter). McPhatter, best remembered for \"Lover<br />\nPlease\", has a solo effort on Volume<br />\nOne.<br />\nPart II. No comment need be made here<br />\non another trend of the last two years,the<br />\n\"rebirth\" of the blues, a fad that seems to<br />\nhave run its course while leaving great<br />\ninfluence. The popularity of white electric blues has spurred interest in black<br />\nmusic from decades ago when marijuana<br />\nwas legal and Lucky Strikes came in green<br />\npacks. So now we have the blues reissue.<br />\n<br />\nBaby Please Don't Go<br />\nBefore Cream and Joplin early blues<br />\nwas generally unavailable, found only<br />\non such labels as Bluebird, Vocalion and<br />\nBrunswick or anthologized (\"Mississippi Delta Blues 1927-1941\") on the<br />\nYazoo label. Not any more. Chess Records, long famous for the myriad rock<br />\nhits of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, has<br />\ncreated a Vintage Series of tapes long<br />\nburied in their files. The series covers<br />\nobscure artists and rare material from<br />\nblues giants - Elmore James, Little<br />\nWalter, John Brim, Otis Rush and many<br />\nother are represented. Two albums have<br />\n<br />\nb'ben renamed, repackaged and reissued:<br />\n\"The Best of muddy Waters\" is now \"Sail<br />\nOn\" and Howlin' Wolf's \"Moanin' in the<br />\nMoonlight\" reappears as \"Evil\".<br />\nLittle-known Blues Classics is another<br />\nlabel doing a superb job reissuing old<br />\nblues. On an album incorrectly titled<br />\n\"The 'original' Sonny Boy Williamson\"<br />\nthey have collected sixteen gems which<br />\nthe second Sonny Boy (Rice Miller) rein<br />\ncorded<br />\n1952-54. Another Blues<br />\n,.Classics classic: fourteen duets done in<br />\n1937-47 by Big Joe Williams and the<br />\nfirst Sonny Boy Williamson.<br />\nTwo very recent reissues from Atlantic Records deserve comment in detail.<br />\nChampion Jack Dupree's \"Blues from<br />\nthe Gutter\" has been re-leased under<br />\nits original title. Dupree, a New Orleans<br />\nbarrelhouse piano player and vocalist,<br />\nis a master of successfully juxtaposing<br />\nexuberant melodies with sharp lyrics<br />\nof misery and pain. Among other things,<br />\nhe has made an album with John Mayall<br />\n(harp) and Eric Clapton (guitar). His<br />\nsinging consistently maintains a credible balance between deep-felt sorrow<br />\nand cynical joy. Never less than great,<br />\nDupree's enthusiastic almost Dixieland<br />\npiano playing creates the gamut of<br />\nmoods from melancholy to drunken mirth.<br />\nPete Brown on alto sax and Ennis Lowery on guitar play surprisingly good<br />\nsolos and back-up.<br />\n<br />\nSniffing Cocaine<br />\n\"Blues from the Gutter\" has many<br />\nhigh points. \"Walking the Blues\" is an<br />\nad-lib jive, with the piano doing as much<br />\njiving as the vocal chords. \"Nasty Boogie\" is a lightning-paced piece which<br />\nshould show Canned Heat how a boogie<br />\nis correctly done. Plus two tales about<br />\ndope which cleverly combine the pleasures of being high (and down) on various drugs with the agonies of addiction.<br />\nHis admonition in \"Can't Kick the Habit\":<br />\nI hung around with my friends and<br />\nsmoked reeeefers,<br />\nAnd I thought I was doin' all right.<br />\nI hung around with my friends and<br />\nsmoked reefers,<br />\nAnd I thought I was doin' all right.<br />\nNow I done lost a good woman<br />\nAnd I have no place to sleep at night.<br />\n<br />\nThe rare breed of blues pianists has<br />\ngenerally been neglected in the blues renaissance. Eric Clapton and Mike Bloomfield propelled blues fans into B.B. King<br />\nand Buddy Guy. I hope \"Blues from the<br />\nGutter\" rectifies this situation.<br />\nThis is not to deny the importance<br />\nof blues guitarists, one of whom has<br />\njust had an album reissued. The man is<br />\nT-Bone Walker, the record is \"T-Bone<br />\nBlues.\" Walker is backed by a pianobass-drums trio on some cuts and various band conglomerations on the rest.<br />\nWalker's singing, while always interesting, is not as colorful and varied as<br />\nChampion Jack Dupree's. His guitar,<br />\nstrangely enough, sounds like a guitar.<br />\nIt is almost like a rock B. B. King (the<br />\nold B. B. King, not the one now doing<br />\nwah-wah and Pepsi-Cola commercials.)<br />\nWalker's playing is intense but not fierce,<br />\nalways confident and sure. Sometimes<br />\nhe falls into the same trap of monotony<br />\nthat makes Elmore James albums less<br />\npleasurable than they could be.<br />\n<br />\nGive Me Back That Wig<br />\nBest cut on \"T-Bone Blues\" is an instrumental entitled \"Blues for Marili\",<br />\nWalker's most imaginative solo. In the<br />\nbreak in the satanic \"Evenin'\", his best<br />\nvocal, he nimbly trades solos with the<br />\ntenor sax. Also outstanding are \"Shufflin'<br />\nthe Blues\", a melodic jazz instrumental,<br />\nand his slow classic \"Stormy Monday\"<br />\n(\"The eagle flies on Friday\"). On some<br />\nof the other cuts the big band jazz backup tends to predominate and obscure<br />\nWalker's guitar work. But all of the music<br />\nis urban blues from another decade -the<br />\n1950's. Perhaps that's what makes the record valuable.<br />\nMore reissues are forthcoming.Starting this May, Columbia will re-lease all<br />\nof their Bessie Smith material - twelve<br />\nrecords in all. Now if someone at Columbia would only get around to the thirteen Robert Johnson tapes they have hidden away. And I'm sure that whoever now<br />\nhas control of Crown Records can get together an album of fine old Lightnin'.<br />\nHopkins blues. The possibilities are endless.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\n<br />\nMay 1, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nSittin' and Smokin' and Groovin': a Beginning?<br />\nBy JILL FANKHAUSER<br />\nIt all began for the yippies during the<br />\nApril 17th sittin at Homewood house, on<br />\nthe front left steps (new left notes)facing<br />\nCharles Street.<br />\nHopkins freaks, a new species in this<br />\nenvironment, were blossoming and the<br />\nleaves had not yet begun to spring. Huddling together for warmth we had found our<br />\nspot (Yaqui sense). Symbolically guarding the door, we had found home and each<br />\nother. This revolution would go on forever, unless the dope ran out first.<br />\nThe sun, the crowd, the politicos, the<br />\n\"administration\", were confronting each<br />\nother on the other side of the house. All<br />\nwas unity on the front left steps. Occasionally someone came around to ask our<br />\nopinion about something. (We were the<br />\nheads of the revolution).\"Run around the<br />\nhouse fast.\" Revolutionary theatre is<br />\nrevolutionary life. It has to function,<br />\nhave real concrete meaning(like forgetting warm) and be a hell of a lot of fun.<br />\nThe fact of running, the fact of Paul Reveres created electric waves in the<br />\n<br />\ncrowd.

Negative words radiating truth<br />\nand love, made meaningful by freaks and<br />\nhelium balloons. That lawn had never been<br />\nused before. A big polyethelene tent was<br />\nerected on three bamboo poles by Buckminster Woodstock. Rustling, translucent, open-ended, beautiful. Human<br />\nbe-ins and two orange cats and Snoopy<br />\nwere doing it.<br />\nDay three. It rained. Join the Peacewatch. We patched the tent, made posters<br />\nand stew. The photographs of the revolution went up on a string across the<br />\nentrance, telling the story of the death<br />\nof the old regime, just two days dead,<br />\nand the birth of the new. From this time<br />\non speaking became difficult. How express place time in progress in all directions through love community?

The Jays have also beaten<br />\nBainbridge (12-6), while having lost to St. Paul's (9-4)<br />\nand Maryland (7-6). Furthermore, in three exhibition<br />\ngames, the baby Jays have also beaten the U. S. Military<br />\nAcademy, Morgan State and the Amherst Varsity team.<br />\nIn the Towson game, the defense under Jim Adams,<br />\nFrank Bond and Jim Ferguson remained tough throughout, especially during the first half of the game, while<br />\nthe offense flourished under John Tennis, Don Krohn and<br />\nKen Windegrad. Tennis finished the game with four assists, and Krohn, five goals. Also gaining points for Hopkins were Jim Pitts with one goal and Ed Levin with one<br />\nassist.<br />\n<br />\nTowson goals were scored in the third quarter by middie<br />\nTim Kane, and 2nd midfielder Eric Roeder (who scored<br />\ntwo for the Tigers). Yet, this was all Towson was able<br />\nto get against goalie Less Matthews (11 saves), and a<br />\ntough Hopkins' defense.<br />\nThe first half, during which the Hopkins' offense had<br />\nmany more shots on goal than that of Towson, demonstrated the true strength of this aggressive defense,<br />\nwhich has done an excellent job this season for Coach<br />\nSotir. Within the first few minutes of the game, Hopkins<br />\nwas hit by a penalty to Jim Ferguson, the\"leader\" of the<br />\nsquad, who played a real tough game(ending up with three<br />\npersonal and two technical fouls). Yet, the defense constantly made the saves, and cleared the ball to attackers<br />\nKrohn, Winegrad and Tennis, as if no penalty had been<br />\ncalled.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins was most effective in the second and fourth<br />\nquarters, when they balanced their defensive effort with<br />\na great attack. In the second quarter, Tennis had two of<br />\nhis assists and one goal, while Don Krohn scored twice<br />\nfor the baby Jays. Likewise, in the fourth quarter, Hopkins scored three times again, once by Krohn, once by<br />\nPitts and once by Tennis, putting the game out of reach.<br />\nThe next freshmen lacrosse game will be at Princeton<br />\ntomorrow afternoon, and will represent as big a game as<br />\nthe one to be held on May 8th against the Navy Plebes.<br />\nWith an overall record of five wins and two losses, the<br />\nFreshmen team has displayed a good deal of talent. Coach<br />\nSotir feels that many players on this year's team will<br />\ncontribute a great deal to next year's varsity club.

In years past the only bright spot<br />\nthe Hopkins fans had in intercollegiate sports was Coach<br />\nBob Scott's lacrosse team. In the past few years there<br />\nwas another sport which began to demand a little respect<br />\naround the campus. Under the new leadership of Coach<br />\nAlex Sotir Hopkins football team not only became respectable but became conference champions three years<br />\nrunning.<br />\nThen came the new look in intercollegiate sports on<br />\ncampus. Coach Jim Valvano, new head coach of Blue<br />\n<br />\nJay basketball, took over a perennial loser and turned<br />\nout a winning ballclub.<br />\nIt didn't stop there. At the same time that our basketball team was enjoying its first winning season in who<br />\nknows how long, our swimming team, under second year<br />\ncoach Frank Comfort, tore up the league and ultimately<br />\nsent eight swimmers to the National College Swimming<br />\nChampionships in Oakland, Michigan.<br />\nAnd now it's baseball. Under first year coach, Hal<br />\nThorne, our Blue Jays are heading towards their first<br />\nwinning season in seventeen years.<br />\nCredit for the rise in athletics on the Hopkins ath-<br />\n<br />\nletics must be given to the new caliber of coach that<br />\nhas come to Hopkins in the past three years. They<br />\nhave succeeded in finally making athletics an integral<br />\npart of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe outlook for next year is even brighter. Coach<br />\nValvano has succeeded in recruiting some pretty good<br />\ntalent out of Maryland high schools. Coach Comfort<br />\nhad a very successful recruiting program and has added a great deal of talent to his already strong team.<br />\nSo, everything seems to be looking up in Hopkins<br />\nathletics and next year should be even better. That<br />\ngoes for the coverage as well.<br />\n<br />\n\fMay 1,1q<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPage 10<br />\n<br />\nCOUPO<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at:<br />\n<br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest Italian food in town<br />\n<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY ONE<br />\nCOFFEE SHOP<br />\nFEATURING:<br />\n<br />\nxerox co les<br />\n527 York Road<br />\n<br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br />\nCALL 889-3831<br />\n<br />\nAcross from<br />\nHut zl er' s<br />\nTowson<br />\n<br />\n8% x 11 unbound<br />\nor i gi n<br />\n828-4011<br />\n<br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nSANDWICHES<br />\nCRAB CAKES<br />\nFRIED CHICKEN<br />\n467-2323<br />\n****<br />\nWe need your heed in a<br />\nbusbies<br />\n<br />\n.

The finance committee of the Trustees has decided to cast Hopkins' proxy votes<br />\nagainst two reform proposals that<br />\nWill be submitted to the GM stockholders' meeting May 22.<br />\n. Under the first proposal a committee of 15 to 25 people selected by GM, the United Automobile<br />\nWorkers and the group sponsoring these amendmentswould prepare a stockholder's report on the<br />\nCorporation's effort to produce<br />\nsafe, reliable, non-polluting vehicles.<br />\nThe second proposal would expand GM's board of directors to<br />\n26 by introducing three new directors who would represent public interest.<br />\nOf the major University stockholders of GM, only the University of Pennsylvania has voted<br />\nto support the two measures.<br />\nMr. George D. Stewart, treasurer of Hopkins, justified the<br />\ncommittee's decision<br />\nfinance<br />\nPrimarily on the ground that the<br />\nproposals were contrary to com-<br />\n<br />\nmon corporate practice, to the<br />\nprinciples of the free enterprise<br />\nsystem and to the University's<br />\ninterests as a shareholder inGM.<br />\nHe represented the investigatory committee as dangerous to<br />\nGM, in that its activities would<br />\ndisrupt and harass the corporation. The proposal to increase<br />\nthe board of directors was unacceptable, said Mr. Stewart, because the new directors would<br />\nnot have become candidates for<br />\noffice through the usual procedure by a suitable (large) number of stockholders.<br />\nWhile the University's shares<br />\nrepresent a miniscule fractiOn of<br />\nthe more than 200 million shares<br />\nof GM stock, universities have<br />\nan influence on stockholder voting beyond their own limited holdings. In opposing the reform measures the University has abrogated its moral responsibility to the<br />\nsociety at large: to encourage the<br />\nproduction and dissemination of<br />\naccurate information, so that people in the society may act in enlightened self-interest. Rather,<br />\nthe University has aligned itself<br />\nwith the philosophy of laissezfaire corporate action, in which<br />\n\"What's good for General Motors<br />\nis good for the country.\"<br />\nThe automobile is a major contributor to air pollution, to the<br />\n<br />\nincreasing death toll from accidents and respiratory diseases,<br />\nto the degradation of the inner<br />\ncity and the flight of middle classes to suburbia.

What yet remains of Wyman<br />\nPark, if preserved, will be considered one of the area's most<br />\nvaluable assets in the future.<br />\nCampus acreage should not be<br />\nsquandered on parked cars, but<br />\ninstead invested for the mind's<br />\nrelaxation (yes, invested - it<br />\nmay cost money!).

No reasons were given.<br />\nAmazing enough, in just one<br />\nnight, his calendar filled up completely, and I was told that Dr.<br />\nGordon would not be back until<br />\nlate Wednesday afternoon. To<br />\nmy still greater surprise, Martin Hickey, President of the Student Association was told by Mr.<br />\nDeKuyper, shortly before 3:00<br />\np.m.(and Dr. Alves spoke at 4:00),<br />\nthat Dr. Gordon was indeed on<br />\ncampus. Again we reiterated our<br />\ninterest in having the former<br />\nAmbassador with us. But he never<br />\ncame...<br />\nNot to overstate my point, Dr.<br />\nexplanations sound<br />\nGordon's<br />\nshallow.

Some<br />\nmonths ago I formed an A11 Hoc<br />\nCommittee to extend the Urban<br />\nCurriculum. We met with all department heads and professors<br />\nwhose field related to urban studies and were led to believe that<br />\nnew courses would be added in the<br />\nfall. The fact is that there are<br />\nfewer urban affairs courses scheduled. A job well done.<br />\nMore enraging than that is that<br />\nthe Social Relations Department,<br />\nwhich has been principally involved with the development of<br />\nan urban curriculum, has caught<br />\nthe same disease that plagued the<br />\nEnglish department. Of the nine<br />\ncourses listed for undergrads,<br />\nfour are taught or led by Dr.<br />\nWickwire. I find this somewhat<br />\nconfusing for a department with<br />\nsuch ignoble scholars.<br />\nFinally, a point which has<br />\naroused me the most.Inthe milirecruitment referendum<br />\ntary<br />\nheld yesterday (Thursday), Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire, who is responsible for 45% of the Social<br />\nRelations course offerings, was<br />\nnot permitted to vote because he<br />\nis not considered a \"lecturing\"<br />\nfaculty member. Judging from<br />\nthe facts, it seems we need more<br />\nnon-lecturing faculty people like<br />\nWickwire. On behalf of the \"Open<br />\nUniversity\" I apologize to Dr.<br />\nWickwire.<br />\nSamuel P. Katz<br />\nEd.

As Attorney General,<br />\nhe serves on the National Security Council and provides the President with inintelligence data for policy formation.<br />\nIn commenting on Vice-President Agnew's assertion last week that the crime<br />\nrate is on the decline, Mitchell attributed the drop to his actions as Justice<br />\nDepartment chief. \"I don't want to seem<br />\nas if I'm blowing up my own horn,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"but I believe that there is a new<br />\nawakening in the archaic system of law<br />\nenforcement in this country.\"<br />\n<br />\nNo Exceptions<br />\nIn reaffirming his stance in opposition to all forms of civil disobedience,<br />\nthe Attorney General stated that unlawful acts by political leaders are no exceptions. He cited as an example, the<br />\nactions of Florida Governor Claude Kirk<br />\nwho recently seized control of the Manatee County School Board for several<br />\ndays in defiance of a court integration<br />\norder. \"When Governor Kirk breaks<br />\nthe law, it is no different than when<br />\nanyone else breaks it,\" he said.<br />\nGovernor Kirk has been charged with<br />\ncontempt of court. On the question of<br />\nviolence at the Democratic Convention,<br />\n<br />\nMitchell confessed disagreement with<br />\nthe conclusions of the Walker Report to<br />\nthe Violence Commission. The Report<br />\nfound that there was a \"police riot\"<br />\nin Chicago. Mitchell, stating that he<br />\n\"would not characterize the events there<br />\nin those terms,\" attributes the 1968<br />\nconvention violence to the actions of<br />\nindividuals.<br />\nIn this light, he made the decision<br />\nto prosecute the Chicago Eight in what<br />\nhe described as \"an anti-riot trial<br />\nagainst several individuals and...not a<br />\nconspiracy trial.\"<br />\n<br />\nDissident Groups<br />\nHe declined to comment on reports<br />\nthat the Justice Department monitors<br />\nthe conversations and activities of members of dissident political groups, saying,<br />\n\"we never talk about that in any form,<br />\nshape or circumstance around here.\"<br />\nHowever, Mitchell stated that he agreed with last week's federal court<br />\ndecision upholding the legality of Army<br />\nsurveillance of civilian war protestors.<br />\nHe contended that such surveillance<br />\nposes no threat to the individual freedom of the people involved.<br />\nMitchell sees the likelihood of a domestic revolution as improbable because<br />\nof what he characterized as an improving long-range economic situation. He<br />\nstated that there was no threat of communist subversion in the early 1950's<br />\nand that he did not then and does not<br />\nnow agree with the charges to that effect made by the late Senator Joseph<br />\nMcCarthy.<br />\nHe said that he doesn't believe most<br />\nanti-war groups are influenced by communists directed from outside the country, but attributed \"the kind of confrontations that took place outside this office<br />\n(the Justice Department) during the November Moratorium\" to \"Maoists and<br />\nothers like them.\" He was, however,<br />\ncareful to distinguish between violent<br />\nmilitants and non-violent groups such<br />\nas the New Mobilization, which planned<br />\nthe November 15 Moratorium.<br />\n<br />\nIi<br />\ndisillusioned little<br />\nAttorney General John Mitchell: \"Violence is limited to those that are<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nsocial<br />\nof<br />\nunderstanding<br />\nnihilists with no<br />\nthe courts into a ruling on de facto<br />\nsegregation.<br />\nThe Attorney General stated that he<br />\nis vehemently opposed to bussing children in order to achieve racial balance<br />\nin the schools. \"In my opinion,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"whether they're white, black,<br />\nred or pink, that neighborhood school<br />\nis the pinnacle of what these kids have<br />\nto hold on to.\" He refused to comment<br />\non the problem of inferior facilities<br />\nwhich plague many inner-city schools.<br />\n<br />\nEnforce It<br />\nMitchell refused to comment on speculation that he would like to see a modification of some of the Supreme Court<br />\ndecisions of the Warren years by a more<br />\n<br />\nA space hearter is an open flame<br />\nburner, usually enclosed in a metal cage<br />\nof some sort.

The<br />\nAttorney General stated he thought the<br />\nSACB could perform a useful function.<br />\nMitchell's most sensitive spot is on<br />\nthe issue of racial desegregation where<br />\nthere are strong divisions within the<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nU.

He denied, however,<br />\ncharges that he would like to see a change<br />\nin the Fifth Amendment.<br />\nAcross his cluttered desk he laughed,<br />\ndeclaring, \"we don't make the law, we<br />\njust enforce it.\" He added that he did<br />\nnot want to tamper with any part of the<br />\n<br />\nadn<br />\ntee<br />\non<br />\n<br />\npresent a danger of serious burns to small<br />\nchildren or anyone who accidentally<br />\nbrushes the heater. The heater is also<br />\nunvented, thus posing a problem of carbon<br />\nmonoxide accumulation. The use of the<br />\nheaters leads to high gas bills as well,<br />\ndue to the inefficiency of the system.<br />\nProhibition of these open-flame heaters was part of the original housing code<br />\npresented to the City Council in 1966.At<br />\nthat time the section with prohibition of<br />\nthe heaters was left out. There are 20,000<br />\nspace heaters in the city, only 8% of them<br />\nin-owner-occupied homes.<br />\n<br />\nEarlier Ban<br />\nA bill was submitted by Alexander<br />\nStark, Douglas,. and Julian earlier this<br />\nyear calling for prohibition.The extent of,<br />\nthe dangers in space heaters was only dis-<br />\n<br />\ncovered as the bill was researched.<br />\nThen the work to outlaw them was<br />\nbegun in earnest. The Health Department, Fire Department and the Department of Housing and Community Development all testified in favor of prohibiting unvented gas heaters.<br />\nResearch done on this topic by Echo<br />\nHouse disclosed that in February, 1970,<br />\nseven burn cases were attributed to the<br />\nunvented gas heaters in 42 homes surveyed. It should be noted that this investigation took place over only a small<br />\npart of the heating season.<br />\nThe Citizens' Planning and Housing<br />\nAssociation, a volunteer group of Baltimore City, are asking for letters from<br />\nas many people as possible to protest<br />\nthe Council's recent action of delaying<br />\na vote on the heating system for 18 months.<br />\n<br />\nthree days before the scheduled start<br />\nof the Connecticut trial of Bobby Seale<br />\nand the New Haven 14 on murder charges. The trial is expected to attract<br />\nthousands of protesters from around the<br />\ncountry, and some observors felt that<br />\nyesterday's raids were part of an attempt<br />\nby police to keep the attention of Party<br />\nmembers focused on other matters.<br />\nThe arrests were carried out by more<br />\nthan 150 policemen, many wearing bulletproof vests and armed with shotguns and<br />\n14 arrest warrants.<br />\n<br />\nClaims No Retribution<br />\n<br />\nad<br />\nti(<br />\nre<br />\n<br />\nan<br />\nwl<br />\nIn<br />\nc,I<br />\n<br />\nrn<br />\n' di<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nIC<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\nd:<br />\n<br />\nBy late last night, there was little ti<br />\nevidence of police activity in the immediate area of Panther headquarterS,<br />\nwhich held 18 persons, among their<br />\npregnant women and children.

We are<br />\nconvinced that imaginative building attracts imagination in funding,<br />\nin use, and in discovery of new<br />\nroles....At this pass our concern<br />\nis not so much with bricks and<br />\nmortar as with bricks and imagination.\"<br />\nWith these words, three Hop-<br /><br />\nRichard Macksey: \"We lost some tennis<br />\ncourts and I'm not sure what we gained.\"<br /><br />\nkins professors ended a letter to<br />\nPresident Gordon, dated October<br />\n1, 1967, a letter which was never<br />\nanswered, outlining a number of<br />\nproposals for reexamining \"the<br />\narchitectural definition of the University's future.\" The letter came<br />\nto the attention of the NewsLetter only last week.<br />\nIn a three-part proposal, the<br />\nmen, Drs. Richard Macksey, Stephen Wolff and Harry Woolf envisioned a new quadrangle in the<br />\narea southwest of Barton Hall.<br />\nThe proposal called for:<br />\n1. A major architectural competition to design the new<br />\nquad, as well as plan for the<br />\nfuture development of Wyman Park.<br />\n2. The renewal of the Urban<br />\nPlanning Conferences with a<br />\nview toward including both<br />\nthe community and major outside scholars in Homewood's<br />\nfuture development. The Conferences have not been held<br />\nsince the 1940's.<br />\n3. The publication of the<br />\nwinning architectural designs<br />\nand the papers of the planning conference by the Johns<br />\nHopkins Press.<br />\nThe three men, along with<br />\nDr. John White, were invited to<br />\nspeak at a meeting of the Trus-<br /><br />\ntees' Buildings and Grounds Committee, but the substance of the<br />\nletter was not responded to, either<br />\nthen or later. \"More than a year<br />\nafter that,\" Dr. Macksey stated,<br />\n\"the President passed Harry<br />\n(Woolf) in the Faculty Club and<br />\nsaid he had gotten his letter.<br />\nbut unfortunately they had already broken ground on the new<br />\nadministration building.\"<br />\nThe building, to be named<br />\nGarland Hall, has been dubbed<br />\n\"Fort Gordon\" by Dr. Macksey.<br />\nDr. White commented that the<br />\nnew building \"would have been<br />\na bad one in the 1930's. In the<br />\n.1970's, it's appalling.\"<br />\nThe architectural consultant<br />\nfor the campus, a New York<br />\nfirm named Rapuano and Clark,<br />\nhas ultimate say over all construction and landscaping. According<br />\nto Macksey and Wolff, the consultants were the only ones hostile<br />\nto their idea.<br />\n\"Apparently,\" stated Macksey, \"they didn't like the competition part. They wanted the<br />\nultimate say, and it seems that<br />\nalmost every building on campus<br />\nhas been designed by local Baltimore architects.\"<br />\n\"Except for Homewood<br />\nHouse and Embryology,\" cornmented Dr. White, \"there is not a<br /><br />\nsingle decent building on campus.<br />\nThe Georgian Style relies upon<br />\nbeauty of proportion and fineness of detail\u2014the idea that you<br />\ncan put up a Georgian building<br />\nin 1970 for a laboratory seems<br />\nto me weird if not crazy.\"<br />\nDr. Wolff elaborated further:<br />\n\"They said that the Administration Building would be Georgian<br />\nin style. Then they told us it<br />\nwould have five stories, and would<br />\nuse concrete instead of marble<br />\nand would have a flat roof. Now<br />\nit has no windows. In sum, it will<br />\nbe a large brick box.\"<br />\n\"I get depressed,\" Dr. Macksey said, \"because, in a sense, this<br />\nnew fortress is the bad beginning<br />\nof a new quad. We wanted at<br />\nleast one or two decent buildings.<br />\nAs it is now, we lost some tennis<br />\ncourts and I'm not sure what we<br />\ngained.\"<br />\nDr. White, Chairman of the<br />\nHistory of Art Department, was<br />\nparticularly vehement. \"Look,<br />\nyou will not get any where until<br />\nyou raise your sights.

A two dollar registration fee had<br />\nbeen charged by the BFU expressly to<br />\ncover the cost of the catalogue.<br /><br />\nBoth parties share the blame for what<br />\nhappened--the Free University because<br />\nof its loose informal administrative<br />\nstructure, and the Aquarian Age Bookstore, for taking advantage of this structure to serve its own ends.<br />\nBennett Hoffman defended the policy of<br />\ncharging money. \"We're not out to make<br />\nmoney. Our main object is making these<br />\nteachings available to those who are interested in them.If the people who have to<br />\nteach need money, then they have to get<br />\npaid. We also need money for professional lecturers, and visual aids.<br />\n\"We didn't really break away. Our<br />\ncourses can still be listed in the Free<br />\nUniversity catalogue, if they want to, but<br />\nthey hare to be run the way that we want<br />\nthem to be. These courses are very im-<br /><br />\nportant to us.\"<br />\nThe head of the BFU, Dennis Krohn, a<br />\njunior, is pessimistic about the future.<br />\n\"What is needed is the judgement of more<br />\nthan one person to run the organization.<br />\nBesides me, there is no one interested in<br />\ncontinuing with the administration of the<br />\nFree University.\"<br />\nKrohn objected to the, introduction of<br />\nmoney last semester into the BFU.\"Nice<br />\nthing about being free is that you're flexible. When you start dealing with money,<br />\nyou have to utilize certain rigorous procedures.\"<br />\n\"The Aquarians were trying to further<br />\nthe esoteric cause, and saw the Free<br />\nUniversity as a viable place to do it. But<br />\nthe BFU was at a weak point and couldn't<br />\nwithstand such an attack.\"<br /><br />\nDennis Khrone. current head of the Free<br />\nUniversity. is pessimistic about its future.<br /><br />\nDepartmental Governance Proposed<br /><br />\nCharged Rent<br />\nA system of governance using the department as its basic unit has been proposed by Dr. Eliezer Naddor of Operations Research.<br /><br />\nUnable to get rooms for teaching at<br />\nHopkins, the Aquarians rented space from<br />\na local Theosophical Society, charging<br />\nstudents at the classes,to cover the rent.<br />\nA confidential source claimed that the<br />\nAquarians where taking in more than<br />\nneeded to pay the rent--in effect, profiting from the Free University. At the<br />\nsame time, the bookstore served as the<br />\nunofficial switchboard for the whole Free<br />\nUniversity, giving out information on all<br />\nthe courses taught.<br />\nAn ensuing confrontation between the<br />\nBFU organizers and the Aquarians over<br />\nthe practice of charging for classes has<br />\ncaused the Aquarians to withdraw all their<br />\ncourses. They are now in the process of<br />\nestablishing the Aquarian University of<br />\nMaryland, which according to Bennett<br />\nHoffman, one of the Bookstore's owners<br />\nwill be the first such institution devoted<br />\nentirely to esoteric knowledge in the<br />\ncountry.<br /><br />\nExpressing his interest in methods, not<br />\nin issues, Professor Naddor's planwould<br />\nprovide what he calls a \"better flow of<br />\ninformation\" among members of the Hopkins community.<br />\nUnder this proposal, every student<br />\nwould choose a department, including<br />\nthose with cross-disciplinary majors.<br />\nWithin each department, students,faculty<br />\nand graduate students would elect representatives to councils of peer groups.<br />\nThese peer groups--separate councils of<br />\nstudents, grad students, and faculty-- together comprise a University Senate.<br /><br />\n'Monthly Meetings<br />\nDr. Eliezer Naddor has proposed that the department be the basic unit of a new governance system.<br /><br />\nOnce a month, each department would<br />\nhold a meeting, where all members dis-<br /><br />\ncuss whatever issues are considered<br />\nimportant. Council representatives could<br />\nbe instructed how to vote on certain matters. The representatives can be impeached at any time.<br /><br />\nStanding Committee<br />\nIn order to deal with large issues, the<br />\nSenate would have a standing committee,<br />\nmade up of representatives from all the<br />\n\"sub-councils\", with the responsibility<br />\nto canvas opinions throughout the Hopkins community, and, if necessary, local<br />\ncommunity, city and state opinions.<br />\nAlso included on the University Senate will be representatives of the Administration and the non-professional<br />\nemployees.<br />\nProfessor Naddor said that he had not<br />\nworked all of the details of his plan yet,<br />\nbut has received favorable comments on<br />\nit from other members of the faculty.<br /><br />\nStudent Council Parking Proposals Rejected<br />\nBy MARC KRIZACK<br />\nThe University Parking and Traffic<br />\nCommittee has unanimously voted down<br />\nthe Student Council proposals to improve<br />\nthe parking facilities on campus.<br />\nHarry Singleton, chairman of the Student Council Task Force on Facilities<br />\nwhich studied the parking situation, has<br />\ncharged the faculty and administration of<br />\nshort-changing the students. \"When the<br />\nfaculty and administration need more<br />\nspace,\" said Singleton, \"it gets taken<br />\nfrom the students.\"<br />\nThe Student Councils' proposals were<br />\nboth long-range and short-range. One of<br />\nthe long-range proposals called for an<br />\nend to segregated parking by September<br />\nof 1970. Singleton said that all parking<br />\nareas should be open to anyone with a<br />\npermit and not just to faculty or administration. \"The purpose of this,\"<br />\nsaid Singleton, \"is to make the faculty<br />\nfeel the pinch so they will bitch and<br />\nsomething will get done\".<br /><br />\nOne Way<br />\nThe other long-range proposal, also to<br />\nbe initiated by September 1970, was to<br />\nturn the road in front of the library into a<br />\none-way road going north with parking on<br />\nthe left-hand side.<br />\nDr. Carl Christ, chairman of the<br />\nUniversity Parking and Traffic Committee and professor of political economy, said that he had been advised by<br />\nWilliam Campbell of the Plant Manager's office that it would be too difficult to control a one-way traffic situation. Christ said that presently many<br />\npeople drive by the barricades which<br />\nare set up for special events.<br />\nChrist also said that faculty priority<br />\nparking is absolutely essential to the<br />\nfunctioning of the University.<br /><br />\nHe mentioned a number of instances<br />\nIn the past when a faculty member who<br />\ncould not find a parking space returned home. He said that if faculty were<br />\nforced to walk to campus, they would<br />\noften be late for classes.<br />\nThe other long-range proposal was<br />\nfor periodic checks to be made to insure that permits are being issued<br />\nwhich met the approval of the University Committee.<br /><br />\nPark Anywhere<br />\nOne of the short-range proposals was<br />\nfor an immediate reduction ot fines.<br />\nSingleton said that this was intortant<br /><br />\nfor seniors who will have to pay huge<br />\nsums, as much as $300 in some cases,<br />\nbefore they can graduate.<br />\nThe proposal for the reduction of<br />\nfines would have allowed those students<br />\nwith fines totaling over $25 to pay 20%<br />\nof that total. Dr. Christ said that this<br />\nwas unacceptable to his committee because, in his words, \"it would be like<br />\ntelling people they could park anywhere.\"<br />\nSingleton said that employees as well<br />\nas students have complained about the<br />\nheavy fines, pointing out that an employee's fines are taken out of his pay.<br />\nSingleton said that the Student Council<br />\nalso proposed a reduction of ticketing<br /><br />\nand towing for all except flagrant violations. These include the blocking of<br />\nroads and loading ramps and speeding.<br />\nThe University Committee did take<br />\nsome action towards reducing fines at<br />\nIts meeting April 23, when it was decided that only the first offense of nonregistered cars parked on campus will<br />\nresult in a $25 fine. Subsequent violations will result in a lesser fine of<br />\n$5 or $10. Presently each offense is a<br />\n$25 fine. Registered cars parked illegally will result in a fine of $3-$5.<br />\nSingleton said that \"the whole thing<br />\n(parking) really revolves around governance.\" He noted that only two students<br />\nare members of the University Committee.<br /><br />\nCISF Finds Landlords Cooperative<br />\nAs a result of a survey begun in February, the Committee for Improving Student Facilities has issued its report calling for a central housing agency for the<br />\nwhole university.<br />\nWith almost 225 responses the members of the committee tabulated figures<br />\nconcerning rents per apartments, rent<br />\nper capita, location, overall condition,<br />\ncooperativeness of landlords. The purpose of the report was originally toprovide information to freshman about<br />\napartments, but it spread to suggestions<br />\nconcerning all facts of undergraduate<br />\nhousing.<br />\nRents for furnished apartments surveyed ranged from $40 to $280 per<br />\nmonth, the report asserted. Unfurnished rooms went from $45 to $225<br />\nper month. The majority of furnished<br />\nrooms cost from $100 to $165, while<br />\nmost unfurnished rooms cost from $100<br />\nto $165, while most unfurnished ones<br /><br />\ncentered around $145. Per capita rents<br />\naveraged from $40 to $45 per month.<br /><br />\nSlum Location<br />\nThe location of the majority of the<br />\napartments involved in the survey were<br />\nbetween 29th and 34th streets and Charles and Guilford Avenues, and the Beech<br />\nAvenue area, west of the campus. Apartments west of campus and farther away<br />\ngive better value for the money involved.<br />\nApartment conditions were rated excellent in 12% of the responses, good in<br />\n50%, fair in 25%, and poor in 13%. Most<br />\nof the fair and poor ratings were given<br />\nto the apartments located in the 29th34th street area.<br />\nThe number of rooms per apartment<br />\nranged from one to ten, with most having<br />\nfour to six rooms. If all rooms includ-<br /><br />\ning living<br />\nrooms, bedrooms, dining<br />\nrooms and kitchens were counted, each<br />\noccupant averaged one and one half<br />\nrooms.<br /><br />\nLease Length<br />\nThe majority of the apartments had<br />\none year leases although some had monthly renewals and nine month leases.<br />\nAbout 55% of the apartments involved in<br />\nthe CISF survey were furnished.<br />\nContrary to popular belief, the report maintains that most landlords were<br />\nconsidered relatively cooperative. The<br />\nones in the area closest to the campus,<br />\nthe 34th-29th street area, were found to<br />\nbe the most uncooperative.<br />\nMost people search for apartments<br />\nin the early spring for over a week.<br />\nOver half rented in the spring or early<br />\nsummer, but some waited until September or October.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nMay 1, 1970<br /><br />\nSOU Petition Gains Referendum on Recruitment<br />\nBy ANDREW GREEN<br />\nClaiming that \"the university is a<br />\nforum for all opinion,\" the Students for an<br />\nOpen University worked successfully<br />\nto bring about yesterday's referendum<br />\non military recruiting on campus.<br />\nWithin three days of President Lincoln<br />\nGordon's decision to end military recruiting at Homewood, a group of graduate and undergraduate students had collected over 800 signatures calling for a<br />\nreferendum on the issue. In his statement Monday, Dean-Elect George Benton<br />\nstated that these signaNEWS<br />\ntures were sufficient<br />\nreason for him to hold<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\na referendum.<br />\nThe SOU was formed as a coalition of<br />\nthree separate groups that had individually been working to oppose the Thursday night decision to end recruiting.<br />\nThe first group formed at the Young Republicans meeting Thursday night when<br />\nnews of Gordon's decision arrived. Led<br />\nby undergrad Gil Morris, they met at<br />\nnoon the following day w ith a second group,<br />\ncomposed of Dr. James Carpenter of<br />\nOceanography and grad students Wes<br />\nBradford and Michael Loftus. A petition<br />\nwritten by Carpenter calling for a referendum had already collected two hundred signatures.<br /><br />\nThis united group then drafted a letter<br />\nto Dr. Benton asking him not to agree to<br />\nany further demands under the \"threat of<br />\nviolence.\" Bradford stated that he was<br />\nafraid that the strikers would become<br />\n\"internally catalytic\" and might turn<br />\nto violence. \"The strikers were really<br />\nuptight,\" claimed Bradford.<br />\nBy Sunday, the petition had gathered<br />\nover 800 signatures. At a meeting that<br />\nday, the pro-recruitment group was joined by another group of undergrads that<br />\nhad been drafting a statement opposing<br />\nthe recruitment ban. After some editing,<br />\nthe group adopted the statement and signed \"Students for an Open University.\"<br />\nThe statement, entitled \"We Dissent,\"<br />\nstated that \"the University must be open<br />\nto all opinions and recruitment efforts.<br /><br />\nTo abridge the rights of one group is<br />\nto endanger the rights of all.\" It was<br />\nupon these principles that SOU based<br />\ntheir referendum campaign.<br /><br />\n\"Dissent 2\"<br />\nAfter Benton decided to hold the referendum, SOU bent their efforts towards urging people to vote military<br />\nrecruitment back on campus. In \"Dissent 2\", a statement published on Wednesday, SOU denied that voting in favor<br />\nof recruitment was tantamount to sup-<br /><br />\nport of the Vietnam war. It also pointed<br />\nout that no recruiting, claimed the statement, is a purely informational activity<br />\non campus.<br />\nWhile the group disagrees with the<br />\nStrike Corn mittee on the issue of recruitment, it is in agreement with the principle<br />\nthat the University is in need of a new<br />\ngovernance system. SOU is trying to<br />\nformulate a policy on governance and to<br />\ndiscuss with the strikers the possibility<br />\nof presenting a united front on governance. An informal meeting with the strikers and the Academic Council on Tues-<br /><br />\nday evening produced nothing conclusive.<br />\nBradford emphasized that SOU members were in no way supporters of the<br />\nwar. \"However,\" stated Bradford,\" we<br />\ncould not see prostituting a basic right<br />\nlike free speech.\"<br />\nMost of the SOU membership, which<br />\nhas about 50-50 undergraduate-graduate<br />\ncomposition, are not political activists.<br />\nAroused over this one issue, they decided<br />\nto take action. Stated grad student Mimi<br />\nMinella, \"I felt that it was about time for<br />\nme to crawl out of the laboratory.\"<br /><br />\nVote Ends Military Recruiting<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nContinuing meetings have been held<br />\nover the past few days between Deandesignate Benton and the representatives of both sides. There has been<br />\nsome disagreement between Benton and<br />\nthe Strike Committee over the nature<br />\nof the talks. Benton claims that he made<br />\nit clear last Thursday night after the<br />\nagreement was reached on the recruitment issue that any further meetings<br />\nwould take the form of discussions.<br />\nHowever, the Strike Committee claims<br />\nthat it has been acting under the assumption that negotiations on the issue of<br />\ngovernance and APL were taking place.<br />\nRepresentatives of the Strike Committee and the Students for an OpenUniversity, along with Dr. Woodford Howard,<br />\nDr. John White and other administrative<br />\nand student officials met with the Academic Council in a closed, informal session Tuesday night to discuss the issue<br />\nof governance.<br />\nThough the meeting<br />\nproduced nothing substantive, the Strike<br />\nCommittee did present its general proposals for the basis of a new governance system. They did not meet with<br />\na great deal of opposition.<br />\nThe Strike Committee calls for \"all<br />\nsegments of the University\" to be represented on the ad hoc governance<br />\ncommittee. Benton has proposed that<br />\nsuch a committee work on the problem<br />\nover the summer. The Strike group<br />\nincludes non-administrative employees<br />\nin \"all-segments.\"<br />\nThe proposals call for the new method<br /><br />\nof governance to be ratified by either a<br />\nstraight one-man, one-vote referendum,<br />\nor on a vote within each segment with<br />\na two-thirds negative vote in any segment vetoing it. This point apparently<br />\ndrew the most fire from the Academic<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe Strike Committee held a noon<br />\nrally on Wednesday in front of Levering Hall. Following folk-singing entertainment, Drs. Pepper, Pfeffer and<br />\nothers addressed the crowd urging them<br />\nto vote no on the referendum. Pepper<br />\nsuggested that if recruiters were a lowed back on the basis of free speech, he<br /><br />\nwould set up a tie selling stand in Levering.<br />\nThe rally also saw the creation of a<br />\nnew group, the Community for a University Democracy, which attacked the<br />\nwording of the referendum and called for<br />\na write-in proposal simply declaring<br />\nthe campus open for recruitment by<br />\nanyone. The group drew three people<br />\nto a 4 p.m. meeting.<br />\nOtherwise, the main activity centered<br />\naround leafleting, telephoning and plastering the campus with signs as both<br />\nsides attempted to win the referendum.<br /><br />\nNew Council Is Elected<br />\nStudent Council and class officers were<br />\nelected on Tuesday and Wednesday of this<br />\nweek.

In retrospect<br />\nit often has brought up an important issue and had good<br />\npoints about it, but adopted a tone that made me throw up<br />\non first reading.\"<br />\nMany readers stated that the paper has a very noticeable bias towards the administration. One student commented, \"The picture of Gordon with a sneaking smile<br />\nwith the headline proclaiming he was sorry that the SC<br />\nwanted to dissolve itself was very biased.\"<br />\nAn overwhelming majority of the respondents said<br />\nthey thought the Tuesday issue was a worthwhile contribution to the campus. Also many said they would enjoy more human interest stories.<br /><br />\nThe poll revealed a serious split among the respondents over N-L editorial policy. Either the reader<br />\nseemed to like it or hate it. A little more than half expressed some to extreme displeasure with the editorials. The critics complained about the simplistic'<br />\nand belligerent tone of the editorials, while others found<br />\nthem generally responsible and well-thought-out.<br />\nGeneral comments ranged from \"Why not save the<br />\nschool some money and sack the N-L\" and \"The N-L<br />\nreeks\" to \"You are O.K. as you are\" and \"The N-L<br />\nhas improved immensely over the four years I've been<br />\nhere.<br />\nI heartily approve of two issues per week.\"<br />\nAnother respondent stated, \"I was particularly disappointed by the coverage of the last campus crisis.<br />\nThe News-Letter, as spokesman for the interests of<br />\nthe undergraduate body, should make a stronger effort<br />\nto represent all sides of opinion on campus matters.\"<br /><br />\nEditorial Split<br />\nMost<br />\nof the answers reflected approval of the<br />\nN-L's layout, but some noted it is sometimes hard to<br />\nread.<br /><br />\nA great majority of students wanted more sports<br />\ncoverage.

His group sponsors tomorrow's First International Ambiguity Frolic in<br />\nWashington.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nFaculty Barbarism<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am a first-year graduate student at this University. Perhaps this accounts for the naive attitude<br />\nwith which I entered Friday's meeting of the General Assembly of the Faculty.<br />\nI was optimistic, for I was under the illusion<br />\nthat the body there assembled represented not<br />\nonly the country's best-trained minds, but also<br />\nthe country's greatest minds. I thought that our<br />\nfaculty consisted of scholar-teachers, men who<br />\nare not only knowledgeable but also wise. I was<br />\nsorely disillusioned.<br />\nIt became evident that the Faculty desired a<br />\nmeeting as hermetically closed as the majority<br />\nof their minds, and that they resented student<br />\nattempts at open dialogue. Their response to two<br />\nstudents who tried to speak during the first half<br />\nof the meeting was one which betrayed their barbarism: the barbarism of the specialist, as Ortega would have it.<br />\nOur supposedly civilized professors of history,<br />\neconomics, political science, the natural sciences<br />\nand the humanities let their true selves be known<br />\nin a few minutes of cat-calls and shouts. The<br />\nmass mentality has pervaded both the upper reacches of government and the body of tenured academicians at Hopkins. Our faculty's monumental<br />\nrudeness to students became even more dramatically exposed when they began to leave en masse<br />\nafter students were finally given the floor.<br />\nThe root of the problem with the faculty at Hopkins lies in the fact that a man's ability as a teacher, his open-mindedness and his flexibility, his<br />\nconcern for students and his sense of responsibility toward the betterment of mankind, is not<br />\nevaluated or even investigated when considerations of the awarding of tenure are made.<br />\nA man is given tenure if he is nationally known<br />\nIn his field of specialization and if he publishes.<br />\nTeaching is deemed irrelevant at Hopkins, because of the mistaken assumption that the most<br />\nknowledgeable man is necessarily the best man.<br />\nFriday's meeting made it clear that he is not.<br />\nI propose that Hopkins neither promote nor grant<br />\ntenure to any scholar who has shown himself to<br />\nbe insufficiently concerned with teaching. A man's<br />\nquality as a teacher could be determined by departmental solicitation of confidential letters of<br />\nrecommendation from undergraduate majors and<br />\nthose majors who have graduated within two years.<br />\nThis would be otte step in bringing the university<br />\nup from barbarism and away from violence.<br />\n,Peterfrl. Komanecky<br />\nDept. ofRomance Languages<br /><br />\nPrint Howard Report<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIf the Editors of the NeNrs-Letter are as concerned about governance as they claim, I wonder<br />\nwhy they haven't considered printing the Howard<br />\nReport. To be sure, it might displace other columns devoted to instant opinion, but it would at<br />\nleast serve to demonstrate that the Editors have<br />\nread the Report they are now discussing.<br />\nJohn W.

This is completely erroneous.<br />\nOn April 9, 1970 several complaints were made<br />\nto the Office of Student Affairs that the Black Panthers were selling literature in Gilman Hall. The<br />\nonly action taken at this time was to telephone the<br />\nBlack Panther headquarters for two reasons:<br />\n1. To explain University policy which requires<br />\nsponsorship by a recognized campus activity or<br />\ngroup for any type of solicitation and which prohibits solicitation by any group within University<br />\nclassroom buildings with a few exceptions - Levering Hall, the lobby of Shriver Hall, etc.<br />\n2. To inform the Black Panthers that a campus organization, which this office contacted, was<br />\nwilling to sponsor them and to set up a station<br />\nfor them within Levering Hall or elsewhere if<br />\nthey so desired.<br />\nAt no time have the Black Panthers or any other<br />\ngroup been singled out on a discriminatory basis.<br />\nIn fact, the Black Panthers have participated<br />\nopenly and freely in programs on campus throughout, the year - without restrictions.<br />\nRobert P.

An old<br />\nidea in classical music, it has recently<br />\nsurfaced to large extent in the fields of<br />\nPopular music. Two fields especially,<br />\nrock and blues.<br />\nPart I. In the last two years America<br />\nhas experienced (very mildly) what's<br />\nbeen called a Rock `n' Roll Revival Sha-na-na, Beatle parodies, magazine<br />\narticles on the Eisenhower decade, midiskirts. Atco Records has just released<br />\ntwo albums overflowing with superb examples of the black rhythm and blues<br />\nWhich spawned the white rock that's being revived today.The records are \"Rock<br />\nBegins\", Volumes One and Two.<br />\nHere it is, man,everything is here: the<br />\nscratchy tenor breaks,the \"0000 bop bop\"<br />\nChoruses in perfect harmony, the onedrum drumming. All you cats and chicks<br />\ncan get your kicks. Dig it, daddy-o.<br /><br />\nDon't Talk Back<br />\nVolume One features husky-voiced<br />\nbluesman Joe Turner singing \"Shake,<br />\nRattle and Roll\"(far superior to the cover<br />\nversions done by Bill Haley and the<br />\nComets and by Elvis Presley.) Released<br />\nin 1954, this tale of marital discord was<br />\nwritten by America's greatest unrecognized poet, Charles Calhoun. Sample<br />\nlyrics:<br />\nI'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a<br />\nseafood store<br />\nI'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a<br />\nseafood store<br />\nWell I can look at you till you ain't no<br />\nchild no more<br />\n(A triple negative in 1954.

Turner is also represented on this<br />\nrecord with his million-seller \"\u2018Corrina Corrina\", a fine thick vocal.<br />\nTo Volume One Ray Charles contributes a 6 1/2 minute version of his imblues-rock-jazz-gospel-Soulmortal<br />\nand-everything-else classic \"What'd I<br />\nSay.\" Other highlights of the album: the<br />\nCoasters' \"Yakety Yak\", one of the first<br />\nand one of the funniest of the generation<br />\ngap tunes; the Drifters' \"There Goes<br />\nMy Baby\"; a fantastic Ruth Brown vocal;<br /><br />\nand La Vern Baker telling her lover<br />\n\"you're as sweet as bubblegum\" (only<br />\nAS sweet, mind you). Unfortunately, the<br />\nrecord is marred by two Bobby Darin<br />\nrockers, an attempt to appeal to the<br />\n\"oldies\" market.<br /><br />\nBroke My Little Bottle<br />\nVolume Two of \"Rock Begins\" has the<br />\nearliest song in the series, the Clovers'<br />\n1952 \"One Mint Julep\". One of the most<br />\nunderrated groups of the period,the Clovers (biggest hit: \"Love Potion No. 9\"<br />\nIn 1959) deliver smooth renditions of two<br />\ntunes on this record.(They do a Charles<br />\nCalhoun song on Volume One.)0ther high<br />\nspots of the second volume are Ray Charles' \"I Got A Woman\" and \"Charlie<br />\nBrown\" by the still-performing Coasters.<br />\nAlso present are the Drifters, as consistently great in the '50's as the Shirelles<br />\nwere in the '60's. They are represented<br />\nby four songs, the two early ones (with<br />\nClyde McPhatter)inferior to the two later<br />\nones (without Clyde McPhatter). McPhatter, best remembered for \"Lover<br />\nPlease\", has a solo effort on Volume<br />\nOne.<br />\nPart II. No comment need be made here<br />\non another trend of the last two years,the<br />\n\"rebirth\" of the blues, a fad that seems to<br />\nhave run its course while leaving great<br />\ninfluence. The popularity of white electric blues has spurred interest in black<br />\nmusic from decades ago when marijuana<br />\nwas legal and Lucky Strikes came in green<br />\npacks. So now we have the blues reissue.<br /><br />\nBaby Please Don't Go<br />\nBefore Cream and Joplin early blues<br />\nwas generally unavailable, found only<br />\non such labels as Bluebird, Vocalion and<br />\nBrunswick or anthologized (\"Mississippi Delta Blues 1927-1941\") on the<br />\nYazoo label. Not any more. Chess Records, long famous for the myriad rock<br />\nhits of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, has<br />\ncreated a Vintage Series of tapes long<br />\nburied in their files. The series covers<br />\nobscure artists and rare material from<br />\nblues giants - Elmore James, Little<br />\nWalter, John Brim, Otis Rush and many<br />\nother are represented. Two albums have<br /><br />\nb'ben renamed, repackaged and reissued:<br />\n\"The Best of muddy Waters\" is now \"Sail<br />\nOn\" and Howlin' Wolf's \"Moanin' in the<br />\nMoonlight\" reappears as \"Evil\".<br />\nLittle-known Blues Classics is another<br />\nlabel doing a superb job reissuing old<br />\nblues. On an album incorrectly titled<br />\n\"The 'original' Sonny Boy Williamson\"<br />\nthey have collected sixteen gems which<br />\nthe second Sonny Boy (Rice Miller) rein<br />\ncorded<br />\n1952-54. Another Blues<br />\n,.Classics classic: fourteen duets done in<br />\n1937-47 by Big Joe Williams and the<br />\nfirst Sonny Boy Williamson.<br />\nTwo very recent reissues from Atlantic Records deserve comment in detail.<br />\nChampion Jack Dupree's \"Blues from<br />\nthe Gutter\" has been re-leased under<br />\nits original title. Dupree, a New Orleans<br />\nbarrelhouse piano player and vocalist,<br />\nis a master of successfully juxtaposing<br />\nexuberant melodies with sharp lyrics<br />\nof misery and pain. Among other things,<br />\nhe has made an album with John Mayall<br />\n(harp) and Eric Clapton (guitar). His<br />\nsinging consistently maintains a credible balance between deep-felt sorrow<br />\nand cynical joy. Never less than great,<br />\nDupree's enthusiastic almost Dixieland<br />\npiano playing creates the gamut of<br />\nmoods from melancholy to drunken mirth.<br />\nPete Brown on alto sax and Ennis Lowery on guitar play surprisingly good<br />\nsolos and back-up.<br /><br />\nSniffing Cocaine<br />\n\"Blues from the Gutter\" has many<br />\nhigh points. \"Walking the Blues\" is an<br />\nad-lib jive, with the piano doing as much<br />\njiving as the vocal chords. \"Nasty Boogie\" is a lightning-paced piece which<br />\nshould show Canned Heat how a boogie<br />\nis correctly done. Plus two tales about<br />\ndope which cleverly combine the pleasures of being high (and down) on various drugs with the agonies of addiction.<br />\nHis admonition in \"Can't Kick the Habit\":<br />\nI hung around with my friends and<br />\nsmoked reeeefers,<br />\nAnd I thought I was doin' all right.<br />\nI hung around with my friends and<br />\nsmoked reefers,<br />\nAnd I thought I was doin' all right.<br />\nNow I done lost a good woman<br />\nAnd I have no place to sleep at night.<br /><br />\nThe rare breed of blues pianists has<br />\ngenerally been neglected in the blues renaissance. Eric Clapton and Mike Bloomfield propelled blues fans into B.B. King<br />\nand Buddy Guy. I hope \"Blues from the<br />\nGutter\" rectifies this situation.<br />\nThis is not to deny the importance<br />\nof blues guitarists, one of whom has<br />\njust had an album reissued. The man is<br />\nT-Bone Walker, the record is \"T-Bone<br />\nBlues.\" Walker is backed by a pianobass-drums trio on some cuts and various band conglomerations on the rest.<br />\nWalker's singing, while always interesting, is not as colorful and varied as<br />\nChampion Jack Dupree's. His guitar,<br />\nstrangely enough, sounds like a guitar.<br />\nIt is almost like a rock B. B. King (the<br />\nold B. B. King, not the one now doing<br />\nwah-wah and Pepsi-Cola commercials.)<br />\nWalker's playing is intense but not fierce,<br />\nalways confident and sure. Sometimes<br />\nhe falls into the same trap of monotony<br />\nthat makes Elmore James albums less<br />\npleasurable than they could be.<br /><br />\nGive Me Back That Wig<br />\nBest cut on \"T-Bone Blues\" is an instrumental entitled \"Blues for Marili\",<br />\nWalker's most imaginative solo. In the<br />\nbreak in the satanic \"Evenin'\", his best<br />\nvocal, he nimbly trades solos with the<br />\ntenor sax. Also outstanding are \"Shufflin'<br />\nthe Blues\", a melodic jazz instrumental,<br />\nand his slow classic \"Stormy Monday\"<br />\n(\"The eagle flies on Friday\"). On some<br />\nof the other cuts the big band jazz backup tends to predominate and obscure<br />\nWalker's guitar work. But all of the music<br />\nis urban blues from another decade -the<br />\n1950's. Perhaps that's what makes the record valuable.<br />\nMore reissues are forthcoming.Starting this May, Columbia will re-lease all<br />\nof their Bessie Smith material - twelve<br />\nrecords in all. Now if someone at Columbia would only get around to the thirteen Robert Johnson tapes they have hidden away. And I'm sure that whoever now<br />\nhas control of Crown Records can get together an album of fine old Lightnin'.<br />\nHopkins blues. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nMay 1, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nSittin' and Smokin' and Groovin': a Beginning?<br />\nBy JILL FANKHAUSER<br />\nIt all began for the yippies during the<br />\nApril 17th sittin at Homewood house, on<br />\nthe front left steps (new left notes)facing<br />\nCharles Street.<br />\nHopkins freaks, a new species in this<br />\nenvironment, were blossoming and the<br />\nleaves had not yet begun to spring. Huddling together for warmth we had found our<br />\nspot (Yaqui sense). Symbolically guarding the door, we had found home and each<br />\nother. This revolution would go on forever, unless the dope ran out first.<br />\nThe sun, the crowd, the politicos, the<br />\n\"administration\", were confronting each<br />\nother on the other side of the house. All<br />\nwas unity on the front left steps. Occasionally someone came around to ask our<br />\nopinion about something. (We were the<br />\nheads of the revolution).\"Run around the<br />\nhouse fast.\" Revolutionary theatre is<br />\nrevolutionary life. It has to function,<br />\nhave real concrete meaning(like forgetting warm) and be a hell of a lot of fun.<br />\nThe fact of running, the fact of Paul Reveres created electric waves in the<br /><br />\ncrowd. This was a real revolution.<br />\nDay two: sunheatcolor on the lawn.<br />\nTropic sea blue cloth, 20 yards of it,<br />\nreading STOP THE WAR MACHINE<br />\nFIGHT THE INJUNCTION in white and<br />\nyellow. Negative words radiating truth<br />\nand love, made meaningful by freaks and<br />\nhelium balloons. That lawn had never been<br />\nused before. A big polyethelene tent was<br />\nerected on three bamboo poles by Buckminster Woodstock. Rustling, translucent, open-ended, beautiful. Human<br />\nbe-ins and two orange cats and Snoopy<br />\nwere doing it.<br />\nDay three. It rained. Join the Peacewatch. We patched the tent, made posters<br />\nand stew. The photographs of the revolution went up on a string across the<br />\nentrance, telling the story of the death<br />\nof the old regime, just two days dead,<br />\nand the birth of the new. From this time<br />\non speaking became difficult. How express place time in progress in all directions through love community?

Lincoln Gordon was to be invited to dinner.<br />\nDisconnected people asked, \"how long<br />\nare you going to stay here? How many<br />\nslept here last night?\" Irrelevant and<br />\nmeaningless questions. An institution<br />\nlives only so long as it serves the individuals. Individuals' needs change faster than the institutions that arise to fill<br />\nthese needs. The revolution is open-ended.<br />\nThe experiment university of lifelove<br />\nheld its first astronomy class Saturday<br />\nnight, the first, that is, since Babylon<br />\nand Ancient Greece, since Galileo, since<br />\nyesterday.

Blood flowed in the arteries and veins of dead or moribund \"subjects.\" Liberation creates liberation<br />\n(and vice versa). Education is about _<br /><br />\nlearning is about sharing what we know<br />\nabout life. Say \"yes\" when our paths<br />\ncross. That's a class. No wonder Jesus<br />\nwas able to fill up those people with a<br />\npiece of bread and a sip of wine. They<br />\nwere all so turned on. \"Love is coming<br />\nto us all,\" he said. \"Carry on.\"<br />\nWe were all dealer,leader,teachers and students.

The Jays have also beaten<br />\nBainbridge (12-6), while having lost to St. Paul's (9-4)<br />\nand Maryland (7-6). Furthermore, in three exhibition<br />\ngames, the baby Jays have also beaten the U. S. Military<br />\nAcademy, Morgan State and the Amherst Varsity team.<br />\nIn the Towson game, the defense under Jim Adams,<br />\nFrank Bond and Jim Ferguson remained tough throughout, especially during the first half of the game, while<br />\nthe offense flourished under John Tennis, Don Krohn and<br />\nKen Windegrad. Tennis finished the game with four assists, and Krohn, five goals. Also gaining points for Hopkins were Jim Pitts with one goal and Ed Levin with one<br />\nassist.<br /><br />\nTowson goals were scored in the third quarter by middie<br />\nTim Kane, and 2nd midfielder Eric Roeder (who scored<br />\ntwo for the Tigers). Yet, this was all Towson was able<br />\nto get against goalie Less Matthews (11 saves), and a<br />\ntough Hopkins' defense.<br />\nThe first half, during which the Hopkins' offense had<br />\nmany more shots on goal than that of Towson, demonstrated the true strength of this aggressive defense,<br />\nwhich has done an excellent job this season for Coach<br />\nSotir. Within the first few minutes of the game, Hopkins<br />\nwas hit by a penalty to Jim Ferguson, the\"leader\" of the<br />\nsquad, who played a real tough game(ending up with three<br />\npersonal and two technical fouls). Yet, the defense constantly made the saves, and cleared the ball to attackers<br />\nKrohn, Winegrad and Tennis, as if no penalty had been<br />\ncalled.<br /><br />\nHopkins was most effective in the second and fourth<br />\nquarters, when they balanced their defensive effort with<br />\na great attack. In the second quarter, Tennis had two of<br />\nhis assists and one goal, while Don Krohn scored twice<br />\nfor the baby Jays. Likewise, in the fourth quarter, Hopkins scored three times again, once by Krohn, once by<br />\nPitts and once by Tennis, putting the game out of reach.<br />\nThe next freshmen lacrosse game will be at Princeton<br />\ntomorrow afternoon, and will represent as big a game as<br />\nthe one to be held on May 8th against the Navy Plebes.<br />\nWith an overall record of five wins and two losses, the<br />\nFreshmen team has displayed a good deal of talent.

In years past the only bright spot<br />\nthe Hopkins fans had in intercollegiate sports was Coach<br />\nBob Scott's lacrosse team. In the past few years there<br />\nwas another sport which began to demand a little respect<br />\naround the campus. Under the new leadership of Coach<br />\nAlex Sotir Hopkins football team not only became respectable but became conference champions three years<br />\nrunning.<br />\nThen came the new look in intercollegiate sports on<br />\ncampus. Coach Jim Valvano, new head coach of Blue<br /><br />\nJay basketball, took over a perennial loser and turned<br />\nout a winning ballclub.<br />\nIt didn't stop there. At the same time that our basketball team was enjoying its first winning season in who<br />\nknows how long, our swimming team, under second year<br />\ncoach Frank Comfort, tore up the league and ultimately<br />\nsent eight swimmers to the National College Swimming<br />\nChampionships in Oakland, Michigan.<br />\nAnd now it's baseball. Under first year coach, Hal<br />\nThorne, our Blue Jays are heading towards their first<br />\nwinning season in seventeen years.<br />\nCredit for the rise in athletics on the Hopkins ath-<br /><br />\nletics must be given to the new caliber of coach that<br />\nhas come to Hopkins in the past three years. They<br />\nhave succeeded in finally making athletics an integral<br />\npart of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe outlook for next year is even brighter. Coach<br />\nValvano has succeeded in recruiting some pretty good<br />\ntalent out of Maryland high schools. Coach Comfort<br />\nhad a very successful recruiting program and has added a great deal of talent to his already strong team.<br />\nSo, everything seems to be looking up in Hopkins<br />\nathletics and next year should be even better.

The finance committee of the Trustees has decided to cast Hopkins' proxy votes<br />\nagainst two reform proposals that<br />\nWill be submitted to the GM stockholders' meeting May 22.<br />\n. Under the first proposal a committee of 15 to 25 people selected by GM, the United Automobile<br />\nWorkers and the group sponsoring these amendmentswould prepare a stockholder's report on the<br />\nCorporation's effort to produce<br />\nsafe, reliable, non-polluting vehicles.<br />\nThe second proposal would expand GM's board of directors to<br />\n26 by introducing three new directors who would represent public interest.<br />\nOf the major University stockholders of GM, only the University of Pennsylvania has voted<br />\nto support the two measures.<br />\nMr. George D. Stewart, treasurer of Hopkins, justified the<br />\ncommittee's decision<br />\nfinance<br />\nPrimarily on the ground that the<br />\nproposals were contrary to com-<br /><br />\nmon corporate practice, to the<br />\nprinciples of the free enterprise<br />\nsystem and to the University's<br />\ninterests as a shareholder inGM.<br />\nHe represented the investigatory committee as dangerous to<br />\nGM, in that its activities would<br />\ndisrupt and harass the corporation. The proposal to increase<br />\nthe board of directors was unacceptable, said Mr. Stewart, because the new directors would<br />\nnot have become candidates for<br />\noffice through the usual procedure by a suitable (large) number of stockholders.<br />\nWhile the University's shares<br />\nrepresent a miniscule fractiOn of<br />\nthe more than 200 million shares<br />\nof GM stock, universities have<br />\nan influence on stockholder voting beyond their own limited holdings. In opposing the reform measures the University has abrogated its moral responsibility to the<br />\nsociety at large: to encourage the<br />\nproduction and dissemination of<br />\naccurate information, so that people in the society may act in enlightened self-interest. Rather,<br />\nthe University has aligned itself<br />\nwith the philosophy of laissezfaire corporate action, in which<br />\n\"What's good for General Motors<br />\nis good for the country.\"<br />\nThe automobile is a major contributor to air pollution, to the<br /><br />\nincreasing death toll from accidents and respiratory diseases,<br />\nto the degradation of the inner<br />\ncity and the flight of middle classes to suburbia. If we have not yet<br />\noutgrown the age of corporate<br />\nirresponsibility we may not survive to see another age.<br />\nJay E. Mittenthal, Ph.

No reasons were given.<br />\nAmazing enough, in just one<br />\nnight, his calendar filled up completely, and I was told that Dr.<br />\nGordon would not be back until<br />\nlate Wednesday afternoon. To<br />\nmy still greater surprise, Martin Hickey, President of the Student Association was told by Mr.<br />\nDeKuyper, shortly before 3:00<br />\np.m.(and Dr. Alves spoke at 4:00),<br />\nthat Dr. Gordon was indeed on<br />\ncampus.

Some<br />\nmonths ago I formed an A11 Hoc<br />\nCommittee to extend the Urban<br />\nCurriculum. We met with all department heads and professors<br />\nwhose field related to urban studies and were led to believe that<br />\nnew courses would be added in the<br />\nfall. The fact is that there are<br />\nfewer urban affairs courses scheduled. A job well done.<br />\nMore enraging than that is that<br />\nthe Social Relations Department,<br />\nwhich has been principally involved with the development of<br />\nan urban curriculum, has caught<br />\nthe same disease that plagued the<br />\nEnglish department. Of the nine<br />\ncourses listed for undergrads,<br />\nfour are taught or led by Dr.<br />\nWickwire. I find this somewhat<br />\nconfusing for a department with<br />\nsuch ignoble scholars.<br />\nFinally, a point which has<br />\naroused me the most.Inthe milirecruitment referendum<br />\ntary<br />\nheld yesterday (Thursday), Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire, who is responsible for 45% of the Social<br />\nRelations course offerings, was<br />\nnot permitted to vote because he<br />\nis not considered a \"lecturing\"<br />\nfaculty member.

As Attorney General,<br />\nhe serves on the National Security Council and provides the President with inintelligence data for policy formation.<br />\nIn commenting on Vice-President Agnew's assertion last week that the crime<br />\nrate is on the decline, Mitchell attributed the drop to his actions as Justice<br />\nDepartment chief. \"I don't want to seem<br />\nas if I'm blowing up my own horn,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"but I believe that there is a new<br />\nawakening in the archaic system of law<br />\nenforcement in this country.\"<br /><br />\nNo Exceptions<br />\nIn reaffirming his stance in opposition to all forms of civil disobedience,<br />\nthe Attorney General stated that unlawful acts by political leaders are no exceptions. He cited as an example, the<br />\nactions of Florida Governor Claude Kirk<br />\nwho recently seized control of the Manatee County School Board for several<br />\ndays in defiance of a court integration<br />\norder. \"When Governor Kirk breaks<br />\nthe law, it is no different than when<br />\nanyone else breaks it,\" he said.<br />\nGovernor Kirk has been charged with<br />\ncontempt of court. On the question of<br />\nviolence at the Democratic Convention,<br /><br />\nMitchell confessed disagreement with<br />\nthe conclusions of the Walker Report to<br />\nthe Violence Commission. The Report<br />\nfound that there was a \"police riot\"<br />\nin Chicago. Mitchell, stating that he<br />\n\"would not characterize the events there<br />\nin those terms,\" attributes the 1968<br />\nconvention violence to the actions of<br />\nindividuals.<br />\nIn this light, he made the decision<br />\nto prosecute the Chicago Eight in what<br />\nhe described as \"an anti-riot trial<br />\nagainst several individuals and...not a<br />\nconspiracy trial.\"<br /><br />\nDissident Groups<br />\nHe declined to comment on reports<br />\nthat the Justice Department monitors<br />\nthe conversations and activities of members of dissident political groups, saying,<br />\n\"we never talk about that in any form,<br />\nshape or circumstance around here.\"<br />\nHowever, Mitchell stated that he agreed with last week's federal court<br />\ndecision upholding the legality of Army<br />\nsurveillance of civilian war protestors.<br />\nHe contended that such surveillance<br />\nposes no threat to the individual freedom of the people involved.<br />\nMitchell sees the likelihood of a domestic revolution as improbable because<br />\nof what he characterized as an improving long-range economic situation. He<br />\nstated that there was no threat of communist subversion in the early 1950's<br />\nand that he did not then and does not<br />\nnow agree with the charges to that effect made by the late Senator Joseph<br />\nMcCarthy.<br />\nHe said that he doesn't believe most<br />\nanti-war groups are influenced by communists directed from outside the country, but attributed \"the kind of confrontations that took place outside this office<br />\n(the Justice Department) during the November Moratorium\" to \"Maoists and<br />\nothers like them.\" He was, however,<br />\ncareful to distinguish between violent<br />\nmilitants and non-violent groups such<br />\nas the New Mobilization, which planned<br />\nthe November 15 Moratorium.<br /><br />\nIi<br />\ndisillusioned little<br />\nAttorney General John Mitchell: \"Violence is limited to those that are<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nsocial<br />\nof<br />\nunderstanding<br />\nnihilists with no<br />\nthe courts into a ruling on de facto<br />\nsegregation.<br />\nThe Attorney General stated that he<br />\nis vehemently opposed to bussing children in order to achieve racial balance<br />\nin the schools. \"In my opinion,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"whether they're white, black,<br />\nred or pink, that neighborhood school<br />\nis the pinnacle of what these kids have<br />\nto hold on to.\" He refused to comment<br />\non the problem of inferior facilities<br />\nwhich plague many inner-city schools.<br /><br />\nEnforce It<br />\nMitchell refused to comment on speculation that he would like to see a modification of some of the Supreme Court<br />\ndecisions of the Warren years by a more<br /><br />\nA space hearter is an open flame<br />\nburner, usually enclosed in a metal cage<br />\nof some sort.

The use of the<br />\nheaters leads to high gas bills as well,<br />\ndue to the inefficiency of the system.<br />\nProhibition of these open-flame heaters was part of the original housing code<br />\npresented to the City Council in 1966.At<br />\nthat time the section with prohibition of<br />\nthe heaters was left out.

The Health Department, Fire Department and the Department of Housing and Community Development all testified in favor of prohibiting unvented gas heaters.<br />\nResearch done on this topic by Echo<br />\nHouse disclosed that in February, 1970,<br />\nseven burn cases were attributed to the<br />\nunvented gas heaters in 42 homes surveyed.
