In<br />\naddition, the University is trying<br />\nto increase alumni participation<br />\nin the recruitment of students.<br />\nDirector of Academic Services<br />\nLarry Denton stressed that the<br />\nincreased promotion is<br />\n\"definitely low key.\"<br />\n\"We don't want a hard-sell<br />\ncampaign,\" he said.<br />\nHopkins has found it necessary<br />\nto increase its<br />\npromotion at this<br />\ntime, Denton said, because the<br />\ncollege market is now \"a buyer's<br />\nmarket.\"<br />\nAccording to Denton, virtually<br />\nany student who is academically<br />\nqualified and who can'apay his<br />\nown way can not attend any of<br />\nthe \"high-cost, bigname\" schools<br />\nbecause these schools are in dire<br />\nneed of money.<br />\nOf the students who a,.!<br />\naccepted without Financial Aid<br />\nto this year's Freshman Class,<br />\nonly 30 percent decided to<br />\nattend Hopkins, as compared to<br />\n40 percent in the two preceeding<br />\nyears.<br />\n<br />\nAt the same time, the<br />\nmatriculation rate of students<br />\noffered Financial Aid last year<br />\nremained the same as in the past<br />\nfew years\u2014about 50 percent.<br />\nThe impact of this shift in the<br />\ncollege market has thus far<br />\nneither hindered the University's<br />\nability to attract sufficient<br />\nnumbers of paying students nor<br />\naffected the quality of students\"<br />\nadmitted to the school, according<br />\nto Denton and Owen.<br />\nBut, the shift has made it<br />\ndifficult for Hopkins to achieve<br />\nacademic diversification in its<br />\nstudent body, Denton said.<br />\nDenton explained that the<br />\noverwhelming majority of<br />\napplicants to Hopkins are<br />\npre-meds, and that most of the<br />\nnon-natural science applicants<br />\nwho are qualified are accepted.<br />\n<br />\nConsequently, if a significant<br />\nportion of the middle income<br />\nstudents who can \"pay their own<br />\nway\" continue to opt for other<br />\nschools over Hopkins the<br />\nUniversity may find its rolls<br />\n<br />\nglutted with Natural Science<br />\nArea majors and pre-meds,<br />\nDenton asserted.<br />\n\"We want to make sure we get<br />\nour fair share of non pre-meds,\"<br />\nDenton remarked.<br />\n<br />\nThieves rob students at pinpoint<br />\nBy LAINY STEPHANS<br />\nTwo male undergraduates were<br />\nrobbed at gunpoint Thursday<br />\nevening in what Chief of Campus<br />\nSecurity George Weinbach<br />\ntermed \"the first assault with a<br />\nweapon ever to occur on the<br />\nHopkins campus.\"<br />\nTen dollars, a credit card and a<br />\ndriver's license were taken from<br />\nthe students by two unidentified<br />\nmales who have not yet been<br />\n<br />\napprehended.<br />\n\"The amount of money which<br />\nwas taken is unimportant<br />\ncompared to the fact that the<br />\nstudents could have been<br />\nseriously hurt,\" Weinbach said.<br />\nThe two students were walking<br />\nnorth on Charles Street near the<br />\nUniversity Baptist Church at<br />\napproximately 11:30 pm when<br />\nthey noticed two youths<br />\napproaching on the same side of<br />\n<br />\nGrades rising at Homewood<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\nDan Holik, student assistant<br />\nto the Dean, will present the<br />\nresults of an eight month study<br />\non the severity and potential<br />\nconsequences of \"grade<br />\ninflation\" to the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies in<br />\nOctober.<br />\n\"The crux of the issue is that<br />\nbecause grades have risen so high<br />\nand so rapidly, it is increasingly<br />\ndifficult to distinguish mediocre<br />\nfrom the truly<br />\nstudent<br />\noutstanding ones,\" stated Holik.<br />\n\"For example,\" he continued,<br />\n\"last year three physics majors<br />\nwere candidates for national<br />\nscience fellowships. The three<br />\nhad averages of 4.0, 3.98, and<br />\n3.93 -- the 3.93 student was not<br />\nchosen. Yet, how much<br />\ndifference could there be in a<br />\nspan of five-hundredths of a<br />\npoint?\"<br />\nHolik concluded that if the<br />\ntrend continues unchecked,<br />\ngrades may cease to be a valid<br />\nmeasure of academic<br />\nachievement. \"The mainstay of<br />\nthe educational system will in fact'<br />\nbe perverted,\" said Holik.<br />\nLeah Seidenfeld, the other<br />\n<br />\nstrengths and weaknesses,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"There is always a jewel in<br />\nadversity\u2014this study will be very<br />\nvaluable for the University.\"<br />\nIn his May speech, Muller said<br />\nthat though consolidation<br />\nwould be the faculty's foremost<br />\ngoal, the University may have to<br />\neliminate_certain academic<br />\nprograms in the near future.<br />\nProfessors Owen Phillips and<br />\nCarl Christ\u2014members of Muller's<br />\nad hoc budgetary<br />\ncommittee\u2014said this week that<br />\nsome reduction in the academic<br />\nprograms of the Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences may take place<br />\nwithin the next year as a result of<br />\neconomic exigencies.<br />\nPhillips said that though<br />\nconsolidation of programs will<br />\nhelp reduce p,rogram<br />\nexpenditures, it may become<br />\nnecessary to reduce or eliminate<br />\nentirely some of Homewood's<br />\nprograms.<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences<br />\nGeorge Owen said yesterday,<br />\nhowever, that the Homewood<br />\ndivision should be the last to<br />\nexperience cutbacks.<br />\n\"My concept of what should<br />\ngo on here is internal rearranging,<br />\nnot a reduction in programs,\" he<br />\nstated. \"I would be resistent to<br />\ncutbacks in Arts and Sciences<br />\nbecause I don't think that the<br />\nother divisions are run as<br />\nefficiently as this one.\"<br />\n<br />\nstudent assistant to the Dean<br />\npointed out that graduate schools<br />\nhave increased their reliance on<br />\nstandardized tests in the<br />\napplication process because of<br />\nthe uniformly high averages of<br />\ntheir candidates.<br />\nHolik explained that he began<br />\ncompiling the report in February<br />\nout of curiosity. \"When I was a<br />\nmember of the CUS there was<br />\nmuch discussion of the<br />\nphenomenon. Everyone,<br />\nstudents, faculty, and<br />\nadministrators seemed to<br />\nperceive an upward shift in<br />\ngrades. However, there was no<br />\nmass of data to confirm or reject<br />\nthis premonition.\",<br />\nConsequently, Holik's analysis<br />\ndraws upon a statistical<br />\npresentation of information on<br />\ngrades released by the Registrar's<br />\nOffice. The most stunning figure<br />\nin the report is the cumulative<br />\nundergraduate GPA from Spring<br />\n1973 of 3.1 \u2014 a significant rise<br />\nfrom the mean GPA of 2.6 in<br />\nFall 1969.<br />\nMoreover, a GPA placing a<br />\nsenior in the top tenth of his<br />\nclass in 1970 was 3.5. A senior in<br />\n1974 needed a grade average of<br />\n<br />\n3.7 to attain the same rank. The<br />\nstatistics also show that more A's<br />\nthan B's have been Oven by the<br />\nfaculty since 1973.<br />\nHolik cited four major reasons<br />\ncausing \"the perceived rise in<br />\ngrades without a_ clear rise in the<br />\nquality or quantity of<br />\neducation.\"<br />\n\"Primarily, the lack of<br />\nemployment for people with BA<br />\ndegrees has increased the<br />\nnecessity of doing well as an<br />\nundergraduate.

For<br />\nstarters, even though they're well<br />\nknown, most people think that<br />\nMonty Python is actually the<br />\nguy's name. (We hip know the<br />\nreal story).<br />\nMonty Python is really a sort<br />\nof latter day Goon Show. For<br />\nthose who don't know, the Goon<br />\nShows were the British comedy<br />\nact about 15-20 years ago.

It's a living.<br />\nThe Goon Shows were never<br />\nvery big over here. For one thing,<br />\nAmericans don't generally get<br />\nBritish humor. The overt<br />\ninanities of the British wit goes<br />\nunappreciated by the American<br />\nmind, which is attuned to such<br />\nfiner forms of funniness as<br />\nPollack jokes and dead baby<br />\none-liners. Another reason was<br />\nthat it was only carried on BBC.<br />\nMonty Python's Flying Circus is<br />\na bit more accessible. They are<br />\non TV, although only PBS in the<br />\nstates, records, and in the<br />\ncinema. Despite all the exposure,<br />\nthey still do not have a popular<br />\nfollowing, only a hip one.<br />\nThey do extensive sketches on<br />\nAustralia (which Americans, not<br />\nthinking the Australians the<br />\nruffians that the British do, don't<br />\nget), like the one on Australian<br />\ntable wines. A fairly drunk<br />\n<br />\nannouncer describes the wines in<br />\nsuch terms as, \"it ranks with the<br />\nworld's best mint-flavoured<br />\nburgundies'', or \"Chateaur<br />\nBriande Wogga-Wogga, which has<br />\na bouquet on it like an<br />\naborigine's armpit.\"<br />\nCharacters such as Mrs.<br />\nPremise am' Mrs. Conclusion,<br />\nlines like \"Lemon curry'?\", and<br />\nsongs like Eric the Half-A-Bee are<br />\nlegends in their own time. Or at<br />\nleast they try to be. It isn't easy,<br />\nyou know. Not many songs are<br />\nlegends. I mean there are some<br />\nsongs that are legends, in as much.<br />\nas they are songs with legends in<br />\nthem. But that's not the same.<br />\nAnyway, in order to<br />\nunderstand them on TV, you've<br />\nalmost got to be British.

However, there was no<br />\nmass of data to confirm or reject<br />\nthis premonition.\",<br />\nConsequently, Holik's analysis<br />\ndraws upon a statistical<br />\npresentation of information on<br />\ngrades released by the Registrar's<br />\nOffice. The most stunning figure<br />\nin the report is the cumulative<br />\nundergraduate GPA from Spring<br />\n1973 of 3.1 \u2014 a significant rise<br />\nfrom the mean GPA of 2.6 in<br />\nFall 1969.<br />\nMoreover, a GPA placing a<br />\nsenior in the top tenth of his<br />\nclass in 1970 was 3.5.

The<br />\nstatistics also show that more A's<br />\nthan B's have been Oven by the<br />\nfaculty since 1973.<br />\nHolik cited four major reasons<br />\ncausing \"the perceived rise in<br />\ngrades without a_ clear rise in the<br />\nquality or quantity of<br />\neducation.\"<br />\n\"Primarily, the lack of<br />\nemployment for people with BA<br />\ndegrees has increased the<br />\nnecessity of doing well as an<br />\nundergraduate.

To<br />\nbe a well-known, well-liked<br />\ncomedian, to get offers to appear<br />\non Cher, is sudden death for the<br />\naspiring hip. Kaplan now has a<br />\nTV show, a sort of real-life Room<br />\n222 (contradiction in terms that<br />\nthat may be) which is very<br />\nfunny.

For<br />\nstarters, even though they're well<br />\nknown, most people think that<br />\nMonty Python is actually the<br />\nguy's name. (We hip know the<br />\nreal story).<br />\nMonty Python is really a sort<br />\nof latter day Goon Show. For<br />\nthose who don't know, the Goon<br />\nShows were the British comedy<br />\nact about 15-20 years ago.

It's a living.<br />\nThe Goon Shows were never<br />\nvery big over here. For one thing,<br />\nAmericans don't generally get<br />\nBritish humor. The overt<br />\ninanities of the British wit goes<br />\nunappreciated by the American<br />\nmind, which is attuned to such<br />\nfiner forms of funniness as<br />\nPollack jokes and dead baby<br />\none-liners. Another reason was<br />\nthat it was only carried on BBC.<br />\nMonty Python's Flying Circus is<br />\na bit more accessible. They are<br />\non TV, although only PBS in the<br />\nstates, records, and in the<br />\ncinema. Despite all the exposure,<br />\nthey still do not have a popular<br />\nfollowing, only a hip one.<br />\nThey do extensive sketches on<br />\nAustralia (which Americans, not<br />\nthinking the Australians the<br />\nruffians that the British do, don't<br />\nget), like the one on Australian<br />\ntable wines. A fairly drunk<br /><br />\nannouncer describes the wines in<br />\nsuch terms as, \"it ranks with the<br />\nworld's best mint-flavoured<br />\nburgundies'', or \"Chateaur<br />\nBriande Wogga-Wogga, which has<br />\na bouquet on it like an<br />\naborigine's armpit.\"<br />\nCharacters such as Mrs.<br />\nPremise am' Mrs. Conclusion,<br />\nlines like \"Lemon curry'?\", and<br />\nsongs like Eric the Half-A-Bee are<br />\nlegends in their own time. Or at<br />\nleast they try to be. It isn't easy,<br />\nyou know. Not many songs are<br />\nlegends. I mean there are some<br />\nsongs that are legends, in as much.<br />\nas they are songs with legends in<br />\nthem. But that's not the same.<br />\nAnyway, in order to<br />\nunderstand them on TV, you've<br />\nalmost got to be British.

The first one,<br />\ncalled And Now For Something<br />\nCompletely Different was the<br />\nbiggest sleeper since What's Up<br />\nTiger Lilly? Actually not a film<br />\nat all, it was a collage of bits<br />\nfrom the TV show, complete<br />\nwith the old opening (a BBC<br />\nvoiced announcer saying \"And<br />\nnow for something completely<br />\ndifferent,\" followed by the<br />\ntheme\u2014Sousa's Liberty Bell<br />\nMarch\u2014and the animated<br />\nopening).<br />\nThe second film, Monty<br />\nPython and the Holy Grail was<br />\nthe real test.

In the summer of<br />\n1974 Muller had called for a zero<br />\nbudgetary<br />\npolicy to be<br />\nimplemented in all administrative<br />\noffices in preparation for the<br />\nfiscal year 1976 budget.

The study<br />\ngroup found, for example, that<br />\n\"General Services and<br />\nAdminstration\" outlays have<br />\nclimbed from $3,312,000 in<br />\nfiscal year 1965 to $12,265,000<br />\nin fiscal year 1975.
