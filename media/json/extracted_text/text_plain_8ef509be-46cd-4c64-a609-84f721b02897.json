Although 'regulations have<br />\noften been criticised as both childish and useless, they undoubtedly are a valuable contribution to an introduction to undergraduate life. That they are somewhat childish no one will deny\u2014<br />\nbut why expect or desire an undergraduate to be completely<br />\ngrown up.?<br />\n<br />\nYES and NO<br />\n<br />\nmbassy<br />\nE<br />\nTHEATRE<br />\n<br />\n\"Just Around the Corner from City Hall Plaza\"<br />\n<br />\nHurrah! An undergrad who isn't afraid to express a thought<br />\nWe knew that if we kept at it long enough, we should receive<br />\nsomething like the communication we print below. Le voici.<br />\nTo the Editor of YES AND No:<br />\nWhile I am in an overworked condition, as are all Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates, and, as I shall proceed to demonstrate, utterly<br />\nincapable of expression, I may fulfill the somewhat Utopian<br />\ndream of an undergraduate who thinks, or thinks he thinks. I<br />\ncannot be at all sure whether the ravings of \"Yes and No\" are<br />\nprompted by a desire to find \"copy\" that will fill space or by a<br />\nreal interest in what the undergraduate thinks, if at all. However, here goes:<br />\nI think that a college edtication, for four out of every five<br />\ncollege men, is a waste of time and money. I should exclude the<br />\nEngineers who get from their work something that it would be<br />\ndifficult if not impossible for them to obtain outside an institution of learning. My statement applies particularly to the several hundred students in the College of Arts and Sciences who,<br />\nafter four years of more or less hard work, receive an A. B. degree and go forth into the \"cold world\" and attempt to secure<br />\ntherefrom a decent living. What does such a man get from his<br />\ncollege career to help him be successful in life? What is success<br />\nin life from the undergraduate point of view? To me happiness<br />\nis success, happiness in doing whatever I may want to do whether<br />\nit be drinking liquor or shaping the destinies of nations. These<br />\nquestions certainly should interest every undergraduate and he<br />\nmust think about them if he thinks at all.<br />\nWe are told that college broadens us. What is broadening,<br />\nand after all are we certain that broadening is a desirable thing?<br />\nMay not broadening lead a man to unhappiness by creating in him<br />\ndesires that he can never satisfy?<br />\nWe are told that college teaches us to think. Does it? Does<br />\ncollege make a man more capable of solving the many problems<br />\nof life which present themselves to him?<br />\nI was much interested in an article by Corey Ford in a recent issue of \"College Humor\" because it explains so well what I<br />\nthink to be the ideal way to spend four years in college. Mr.<br />\nFord says: \"If I had a son (in college) I'd give him all the<br />\nmoney he could possibly spend. I'd tell him to read a great deal<br />\nof the books he Wants to read, go to a lot of theaters, and have<br />\nparties now and then; and if he came home with a degree I'd<br />\ndisown him. I'd warn him to stay away from extra-curricular<br />\nactivities, and I'd tell him to cut a class whenever he found<br />\nsomeone worth talking to.\" Perhaps these ideas are all wrong<br />\nbut it seems to me that if it's broadening we are after this system should certainly give it to us. What do you think?<br />\nIn order to insure sufficient \"copy\" for \"Yes and No\" I add<br />\nthat I do enjoy looking at beautiful women, I do enjoy gambling<br />\nin all its forms, and drinking at least sufficient alcohol to make<br />\nmy heart glad if there is reason why it should be glad. I hereby<br />\nchallenge the more righteous among us, including the Y. M. C. A.,<br />\nto tell me why I shouldn't do these things if I so desire and I<br />\nhope that I can find someone who will help me to answer, in connection with college, the old question, \"What's it all about ?\"<br />\n<br />\nPROGRAM FOR WEEK<br />\n<br />\nCommencing Monday, Dec.6 th<br />\nPARAMOUNT Presents<br />\nA MARSHALL NEILAN PRODUCTION<br />\n<br />\n\"EVERYBODY'S ACTING\"<br />\n<br />\nwith this great cast<br />\nBKTTY BRONSON\u2014FORD STERLING<br />\nLOUISE.

Although 'regulations have<br />\noften been criticised as both childish and useless, they undoubtedly are a valuable contribution to an introduction to undergraduate life. That they are somewhat childish no one will deny\u2014<br />\nbut why expect or desire an undergraduate to be completely<br />\ngrown up.?<br /><br />\nYES and NO<br /><br />\nmbassy<br />\nE<br />\nTHEATRE<br /><br />\n\"Just Around the Corner from City Hall Plaza\"<br /><br />\nHurrah! An undergrad who isn't afraid to express a thought<br />\nWe knew that if we kept at it long enough, we should receive<br />\nsomething like the communication we print below. Le voici.<br />\nTo the Editor of YES AND No:<br />\nWhile I am in an overworked condition, as are all Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates, and, as I shall proceed to demonstrate, utterly<br />\nincapable of expression, I may fulfill the somewhat Utopian<br />\ndream of an undergraduate who thinks, or thinks he thinks. I<br />\ncannot be at all sure whether the ravings of \"Yes and No\" are<br />\nprompted by a desire to find \"copy\" that will fill space or by a<br />\nreal interest in what the undergraduate thinks, if at all. However, here goes:<br />\nI think that a college edtication, for four out of every five<br />\ncollege men, is a waste of time and money. I should exclude the<br />\nEngineers who get from their work something that it would be<br />\ndifficult if not impossible for them to obtain outside an institution of learning. My statement applies particularly to the several hundred students in the College of Arts and Sciences who,<br />\nafter four years of more or less hard work, receive an A. B. degree and go forth into the \"cold world\" and attempt to secure<br />\ntherefrom a decent living. What does such a man get from his<br />\ncollege career to help him be successful in life? What is success<br />\nin life from the undergraduate point of view? To me happiness<br />\nis success, happiness in doing whatever I may want to do whether<br />\nit be drinking liquor or shaping the destinies of nations. These<br />\nquestions certainly should interest every undergraduate and he<br />\nmust think about them if he thinks at all.<br />\nWe are told that college broadens us. What is broadening,<br />\nand after all are we certain that broadening is a desirable thing?<br />\nMay not broadening lead a man to unhappiness by creating in him<br />\ndesires that he can never satisfy?<br />\nWe are told that college teaches us to think. Does it? Does<br />\ncollege make a man more capable of solving the many problems<br />\nof life which present themselves to him?<br />\nI was much interested in an article by Corey Ford in a recent issue of \"College Humor\" because it explains so well what I<br />\nthink to be the ideal way to spend four years in college. Mr.<br />\nFord says: \"If I had a son (in college) I'd give him all the<br />\nmoney he could possibly spend. I'd tell him to read a great deal<br />\nof the books he Wants to read, go to a lot of theaters, and have<br />\nparties now and then; and if he came home with a degree I'd<br />\ndisown him. I'd warn him to stay away from extra-curricular<br />\nactivities, and I'd tell him to cut a class whenever he found<br />\nsomeone worth talking to.\" Perhaps these ideas are all wrong<br />\nbut it seems to me that if it's broadening we are after this system should certainly give it to us. What do you think?<br />\nIn order to insure sufficient \"copy\" for \"Yes and No\" I add<br />\nthat I do enjoy looking at beautiful women, I do enjoy gambling<br />\nin all its forms, and drinking at least sufficient alcohol to make<br />\nmy heart glad if there is reason why it should be glad. I hereby<br />\nchallenge the more righteous among us, including the Y. M. C. A.,<br />\nto tell me why I shouldn't do these things if I so desire and I<br />\nhope that I can find someone who will help me to answer, in connection with college, the old question, \"What's it all about ?\"<br /><br />\nPROGRAM FOR WEEK<br /><br />\nCommencing Monday, Dec.6 th<br />\nPARAMOUNT Presents<br />\nA MARSHALL NEILAN PRODUCTION<br /><br />\n\"EVERYBODY'S ACTING\"<br /><br />\nwith this great cast<br />\nBKTTY BRONSON\u2014FORD STERLING<br />\nLOUISE.

A stranger was<br />\nadmitted who stated that he was a<br />\nmember of another fraternity, a<br />\nstranger in town, and that, in short,<br />\nhe was lost. He was persuaded to<br />\ncome in, and entered into a short<br />\nconversation during which it was<br />\nmentioned that the house would be<br />\nvacant during the afteinoon. The<br />\nstranger was then given his directions and he. departed. Shortly<br />\nafterwards everyone left for the<br />\nrush.<br />\nOn their return the robbery was<br />\ndiscovered.
