There is no doubt that a<br />\ngreat many of the men who find<br />\nthemselves ineligible could prevent<br />\nby making half the effort before<br />\nthe examinations that they make<br />\nafterwards trying to have their<br />\nmarks raised. Why does not the<br />\n0. D. K. appoint a committee to<br />\nwatch the student standing of the<br />\nmen playing on teams, and to encourage them before it is too late?<br />\nThis could most certainly be done.<br />\nA number of the students who do<br />\nnot compete in athletics would be<br />\nonly too glad to show their college<br />\nspirit by helping those men on the<br />\nfootball squad who find it utterly<br />\nimpossible to do as much work as<br />\nthey should at night. It might be<br />\nargued that this would lead on to<br />\nsome of the men slackening their<br />\nown efforts in the hope that their<br />\nwork would be taken care of for<br />\nthem by others. The majority,<br />\nhowever, would feel that the student body appreciated the efforts<br />\nhey were making and would work<br />\nthe harder.<br />\nDAVIDGE H. ROWLAND.<br />\n<br />\nGoodnow And others who have returned recently from Europe report<br />\nthat the conditions of student life<br />\nare so wretched that we Americans<br />\ncannot conceive how bad they are.<br />\nIn Vienna students are huddled together like so many cattle in the<br />\nupper floors of barns, and are living<br />\non the scarcest amount of food for<br />\nlack of sufficient funds to provide<br />\nbetter quarters and decent food.<br />\nLet us, the students of Johns<br />\nHopkins University, show that our<br />\nhearts are in the right place and<br />\ncontribute a handsome sum to the<br />\nStudent Friendship Fund. One<br />\ndollar in America is worth many<br />\ntimes its value to the European students. Remember that in forwarding such a cause as this you are<br />\nmaking the future leaders of Europe better men and, consequently,<br />\nbetter neighbors. Our fellow students from across the sea are calling for help. Come on, FIopkins<br />\nmen, let's reach across the sea and<br />\ngive them our support.<br />\nFRIEND OF STUDENTS.<br />\n<br />\nCOTILLON BOARD MAKES ANNOUNCEMENTS REGARDING<br />\nCOMING DANCES<br />\n<br />\nThe Cotillon Board has selected Wednesday, December 21, as<br />\nthe date for its first big dance ana<br />\nplans for the affair are rapidly<br />\ntaking shape. The price of the<br />\ntickets has not yet been decided<br />\nupon, but will be announced in<br />\nthe near future.<br />\nIn the meantime informal<br />\ndances will be held in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building after the<br />\nfootball games. The first of these<br />\nwill take place after the Haverford game on November 5, the<br />\nother two following the contests<br />\nwith St. John's and Washington<br />\nand Lee. 1 hose wishing tickets<br />\nfor the dances must make their<br />\nreservations in advance, as due to<br />\nthe small floor space in the C .E.<br />\nHall, only 100 tickets will be on<br />\nsale for each dance. The price of<br />\nthe tickets will be 50 cents. The<br />\nmusic will be furnished by the<br />\nStudent Orchestra and punch<br />\nwill be served.<br />\nACTIVITIES BUTTONS ARE<br />\nDISTRIBUTED<br />\n<br />\nDuring every lunch hour last<br />\nweek the Student Council was besieged by scores of freshmen seeking the magic button that would<br />\nprovide immunity from sopho more's paddles; buttons that show<br />\nthat the frosh had complied with<br />\nthe Freshman Regulation that<br />\n\"every freshman must be actively<br />\nparticipating in some recognized<br />\nstudent activity.<br />\nThe buttons were given to all<br />\nfreshmen who applied and the<br />\nname of the actiyity in which they<br />\nprofessed to be engaged was carefully recorded. These will be<br />\nchecked up with official lists. Due<br />\naction will be taken with the unfortunate ones who procured buttons under false pretenses or<br />\nfailed to obtain them at all.<br />\nDEAN LATANE ADDRESSES<br />\nSTUDENT ASSEMBLY<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\n<br />\nAN APPEAL FOR FOREIGNSTUDENT AID<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDEAR SIR: Again the students of<br />\nAmerica and of the other twentysix countries that helped financially,<br />\nthe European students last year are<br />\ncalled upon to subscribe to this<br />\nsame cause through the student<br />\nFriendship Fund. The students of<br />\ndevastated Europe are living under<br />\nthe most miserable conditions in order to continue their studies. Dr.<br />\n<br />\ntions for the Black and Blue Jay,<br />\nand Wood announced that that<br />\nwould be the last day for giving out<br />\nFreshman Student Activities Buttons. The secretary of the Hopkins Y. M. C.

There is no doubt that a<br />\ngreat many of the men who find<br />\nthemselves ineligible could prevent<br />\nby making half the effort before<br />\nthe examinations that they make<br />\nafterwards trying to have their<br />\nmarks raised. Why does not the<br />\n0. D. K. appoint a committee to<br />\nwatch the student standing of the<br />\nmen playing on teams, and to encourage them before it is too late?<br />\nThis could most certainly be done.<br />\nA number of the students who do<br />\nnot compete in athletics would be<br />\nonly too glad to show their college<br />\nspirit by helping those men on the<br />\nfootball squad who find it utterly<br />\nimpossible to do as much work as<br />\nthey should at night. It might be<br />\nargued that this would lead on to<br />\nsome of the men slackening their<br />\nown efforts in the hope that their<br />\nwork would be taken care of for<br />\nthem by others. The majority,<br />\nhowever, would feel that the student body appreciated the efforts<br />\nhey were making and would work<br />\nthe harder.<br />\nDAVIDGE H. ROWLAND.<br /><br />\nGoodnow And others who have returned recently from Europe report<br />\nthat the conditions of student life<br />\nare so wretched that we Americans<br />\ncannot conceive how bad they are.<br />\nIn Vienna students are huddled together like so many cattle in the<br />\nupper floors of barns, and are living<br />\non the scarcest amount of food for<br />\nlack of sufficient funds to provide<br />\nbetter quarters and decent food.<br />\nLet us, the students of Johns<br />\nHopkins University, show that our<br />\nhearts are in the right place and<br />\ncontribute a handsome sum to the<br />\nStudent Friendship Fund. One<br />\ndollar in America is worth many<br />\ntimes its value to the European students. Remember that in forwarding such a cause as this you are<br />\nmaking the future leaders of Europe better men and, consequently,<br />\nbetter neighbors. Our fellow students from across the sea are calling for help. Come on, FIopkins<br />\nmen, let's reach across the sea and<br />\ngive them our support.<br />\nFRIEND OF STUDENTS.<br /><br />\nCOTILLON BOARD MAKES ANNOUNCEMENTS REGARDING<br />\nCOMING DANCES<br /><br />\nThe Cotillon Board has selected Wednesday, December 21, as<br />\nthe date for its first big dance ana<br />\nplans for the affair are rapidly<br />\ntaking shape. The price of the<br />\ntickets has not yet been decided<br />\nupon, but will be announced in<br />\nthe near future.<br />\nIn the meantime informal<br />\ndances will be held in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building after the<br />\nfootball games. The first of these<br />\nwill take place after the Haverford game on November 5, the<br />\nother two following the contests<br />\nwith St. John's and Washington<br />\nand Lee. 1 hose wishing tickets<br />\nfor the dances must make their<br />\nreservations in advance, as due to<br />\nthe small floor space in the C .E.<br />\nHall, only 100 tickets will be on<br />\nsale for each dance. The price of<br />\nthe tickets will be 50 cents. The<br />\nmusic will be furnished by the<br />\nStudent Orchestra and punch<br />\nwill be served.<br />\nACTIVITIES BUTTONS ARE<br />\nDISTRIBUTED<br /><br />\nDuring every lunch hour last<br />\nweek the Student Council was besieged by scores of freshmen seeking the magic button that would<br />\nprovide immunity from sopho more's paddles; buttons that show<br />\nthat the frosh had complied with<br />\nthe Freshman Regulation that<br />\n\"every freshman must be actively<br />\nparticipating in some recognized<br />\nstudent activity.<br />\nThe buttons were given to all<br />\nfreshmen who applied and the<br />\nname of the actiyity in which they<br />\nprofessed to be engaged was carefully recorded. These will be<br />\nchecked up with official lists. Due<br />\naction will be taken with the unfortunate ones who procured buttons under false pretenses or<br />\nfailed to obtain them at all.<br />\nDEAN LATANE ADDRESSES<br />\nSTUDENT ASSEMBLY<br />\nContinued from page 1<br /><br />\nAN APPEAL FOR FOREIGNSTUDENT AID<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDEAR SIR: Again the students of<br />\nAmerica and of the other twentysix countries that helped financially,<br />\nthe European students last year are<br />\ncalled upon to subscribe to this<br />\nsame cause through the student<br />\nFriendship Fund. The students of<br />\ndevastated Europe are living under<br />\nthe most miserable conditions in order to continue their studies.
