If a move toward a bonfire has already<br />\nbeen made, so much the better. If not, some action ought to be<br />\ntaken at once.<br />\nPerhaps this urging of a bonfire seems trivial or even childish. Why should the NEWS-LETTER, you may say, seriously advocate the collection of a huge pile of boxes, and its subsequent<br />\nburning accompanied by a large volume of noise? That, however, is not the point, such a thing as a pre-game bonfire cannot<br />\nbe judged at its face value.<br />\nThat indefinable quality known as college spirit is at the root<br />\nof the matter. We cannot explain this spirit; it is one of those<br />\nexpressions of fine and unselfish loyalty which has no logical explanation. All we know is that we believe in it just as have those<br />\nwho have gone before us did.<br />\nAt Hopkins, as at most colleges, this esprit de corps centers<br />\nlargely around athletics. The team, playing its hardest with a<br />\nfeeling that in some way it is working for the alma mater, and<br />\nthe rest of the students, behind it to a man, create an enthusiasm<br />\nand solidarity which is very beneficial to the college.<br />\nThe bonfire is the place to develop this enthusiasm and support. As we have said, it may appear absurd, but it is there<br />\nthat spirit is rampant. Few who have circled around the blazing<br />\npyramid or marched down Charles street behind a wheezing band<br />\nhave failed to develop a more intense thrill of pride at the mention of the name of Hopkins.<br />\nTrue, the primary purpose of the rally is to work up enthusiasm to urge the team on to victory the following day. In the<br />\npast it has often been effectual; we trust it will continue to be.<br />\nBut win or lose, the bonfire accomplishes a great deal in building<br />\nup college morale.<br />\n<br />\nDR. EDMUNDS<br />\nAlthough news of his departure has been released for some<br />\ntime, the fact that Dr. Edmunds has actually left the University<br />\nis difficult to realize. Dr. Edmunds' presence on the campus, and<br />\nin the efficiently organized Half Century office has been too deeply<br />\nimpressed on the undergraduate memory to be easily forgotten.<br />\nThe arrangement of the Half Century Celebration was a<br />\ntremendous task. The planning of the affair and the direction of<br />\nthe great mass of detail were for the most part in the hands of<br />\nDr. Edmunds. The success of the Anniversary was due in a<br />\nvery large measure to his efforts.<br />\nWe are sorry to see Dr. Edmunds leave Hopkins. It is true<br />\nthat he is going into a larger field, one in which he is probably<br />\nmore deeply interested; and it is equally certain that under the<br />\ndirection of Dr. Ames the work will go on with as much success.<br />\nThis, however, does not prevent our feeling that Hopkins has<br />\nlost a devoted worker and a distinct personality.<br />\n<br />\n\"YES and NO\"<br />\nWe all recognize, more or less, vividly the comparative<br />\nlethargy that follows examination; either by the faculty, an ardent<br />\nGoucherite or a fraternity. Now that rushing season is gone we<br />\nare minus a ready and efficacious self-excuser for our conscience,<br />\nthat too well worn fallacy that after rushing season \"to work<br />\nand sane living.\" In place of this talisman we substitute a term<br />\nthat sounds well at home; \"goes over\" with some of the faculty<br />\nand has all the ear marks, but none of the drudgery, of absorbing knowledge. We call it \"browsing\" in the library. Perhaps,<br />\nin days gone it was possible in the Main Library to quite lose<br />\noneself in a perusal of a favorite book, magazine or periodical<br />\nthat catered to one's particular taste. And even now between<br />\ndisturbed glances across the library at a glaring inch or so of<br />\nflesh between a jet dress and black-colored hose, we are conscious of an occasional interest in things pedagogical.<br />\nOur interest here is rather simple; so dubious in nature that<br />\nwe hesitate to offer it. However, there is a little blue paper bound<br />\npamphlet on the horseshoe table in the Main Library that is interesting from the point of view that novelty provokes interest.<br />\nAs for example, if upon sitting down at a piano you were suddenly endowed with the power to produce sounds that were recognized as music, without previous knowledge, or acquisition of<br />\nskill. We picked up the little book to examine it, perfunctorily<br />\nas we do many foreign publications. Its title is \"Academia pro<br />\nInterlingua.\" We leaved it over and were for the next few minutes engrossed in conveying to our mind concrete, definite images.<br />\nAt first we were convinced that it was Latin\u2014but voted that assumption out since we were reading it! Which is impossible.<br />\nOn one of the pages we found the following which cleared the<br />\nfog considerably.<br />\n\"Virtutes de Interlingua.\"<br />\n\"Academia consilia pro Interlingua<br />\nVocabulario internationale, Othographia latino, sine grammatica.\"<br />\nOrthographia latino redde interlingua intelligible sine studio<br />\nad lectore que habe cognitione, et superficiale, de latino, id es ad<br />\nomne sacerdote, advocato, medico, professore, in toto mundus.<br />\nSuppressione de grammatica permitte ad lectore que ignora<br />\nlatino, de lege et scribe in IL cum auxilio de solo vocabulario<br />\nlatino.\"<br />\nWe hesitate to say more of our reaction to the book, since<br />\nwe have no desire to be identified with championing it. We wish<br />\nsimply to wonder why the idea has not been exploited further.<br />\nIs it not novel that one may pick up a book produced by Polish<br />\nfollowers, published in Torino (wherever that is) and read it<br />\nwithout hesitation or study in America? What are the chief<br />\nobjections to such a language; at least superficially, may we appeal to some member of the graduate department in Modern Languages to enlighten us. We are assured from many sources that<br />\nsuch a reply would be interesting reading.<br />\n<br />\nmbassy<br />\nE<br />\nTHEATRE<br />\n<br />\nan(<br />\n<br />\nThis Week<br />\nCommencing Monday<br />\nNovember 1<br />\n<br />\nsor<br />\n<br />\nWe haven't the slightest compunction in printing the foregoing letter.

We<br />\ndo not believe, however, that the recent open week was altogether<br />\nbad; certainly it was not useless.<br />\nNo matter how well a student knows a given fraternity before joining it, he is bound to find out later some things he was<br />\nnot aware of. It is essential that the pledge know the character<br />\nand ideals of his would-be fraternity brothers, as well as their<br />\nsocial standing. We doubt if such a knowledge can be obtained<br />\non the day of pledging.<br />\nThe question of expense to the fraternity is mentioned by<br />\nthe Editor; we are of the opinion that freshmen should pay their<br />\nown way at banquets and theatres. It is up to the fraternities<br />\nto so regulate their entertainments as not to impoverish themselves.<br />\nLastly, we believe that ideals, no matter how hazy, are a<br />\nbeneficial influence; they tend to place fraternity competition on<br />\na higher, cleaner plane.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nRUSTICUS.<br />\n<br />\nhoi<br />\n<br />\n\u201cJust Around the Corner from City Hail\"<br />\n<br />\n100<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\n<br />\nPARKWAY<br />\n<br />\nWest Corner Canterbury Road<br />\n<br />\nlittiess<br />\nwith<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, NOVEMBER 5, 1926<br />\nNEWS-LETTER MAIL-BAG<br />\nCORRESPONDENCE<br />\n(Continued from page 4, column 5)<br />\n<br />\nhonor of the University, the meek<br />\nand self-conscious freshman, the<br />\nsophisticated sophomore, the jovial<br />\nJunior, the serious single seniors,<br />\nand even graduate students have<br />\nbeen known to display their ignorance in the technique and theory<br />\nof this ever prevalent art.<br />\nAt sometime in the near future,<br />\n)11f<br />\n<br />\nvine<br />\n<br />\nWhen a few minutes of the after\"on hang heavily upon you, take<br />\nan observing stroll into the vicinity<br />\nof the southern Arcade.

If a move toward a bonfire has already<br />\nbeen made, so much the better. If not, some action ought to be<br />\ntaken at once.<br />\nPerhaps this urging of a bonfire seems trivial or even childish. Why should the NEWS-LETTER, you may say, seriously advocate the collection of a huge pile of boxes, and its subsequent<br />\nburning accompanied by a large volume of noise? That, however, is not the point, such a thing as a pre-game bonfire cannot<br />\nbe judged at its face value.<br />\nThat indefinable quality known as college spirit is at the root<br />\nof the matter. We cannot explain this spirit; it is one of those<br />\nexpressions of fine and unselfish loyalty which has no logical explanation. All we know is that we believe in it just as have those<br />\nwho have gone before us did.<br />\nAt Hopkins, as at most colleges, this esprit de corps centers<br />\nlargely around athletics. The team, playing its hardest with a<br />\nfeeling that in some way it is working for the alma mater, and<br />\nthe rest of the students, behind it to a man, create an enthusiasm<br />\nand solidarity which is very beneficial to the college.<br />\nThe bonfire is the place to develop this enthusiasm and support. As we have said, it may appear absurd, but it is there<br />\nthat spirit is rampant. Few who have circled around the blazing<br />\npyramid or marched down Charles street behind a wheezing band<br />\nhave failed to develop a more intense thrill of pride at the mention of the name of Hopkins.<br />\nTrue, the primary purpose of the rally is to work up enthusiasm to urge the team on to victory the following day. In the<br />\npast it has often been effectual; we trust it will continue to be.<br />\nBut win or lose, the bonfire accomplishes a great deal in building<br />\nup college morale.<br /><br />\nDR. EDMUNDS<br />\nAlthough news of his departure has been released for some<br />\ntime, the fact that Dr. Edmunds has actually left the University<br />\nis difficult to realize. Dr. Edmunds' presence on the campus, and<br />\nin the efficiently organized Half Century office has been too deeply<br />\nimpressed on the undergraduate memory to be easily forgotten.<br />\nThe arrangement of the Half Century Celebration was a<br />\ntremendous task. The planning of the affair and the direction of<br />\nthe great mass of detail were for the most part in the hands of<br />\nDr. Edmunds. The success of the Anniversary was due in a<br />\nvery large measure to his efforts.<br />\nWe are sorry to see Dr. Edmunds leave Hopkins. It is true<br />\nthat he is going into a larger field, one in which he is probably<br />\nmore deeply interested; and it is equally certain that under the<br />\ndirection of Dr. Ames the work will go on with as much success.<br />\nThis, however, does not prevent our feeling that Hopkins has<br />\nlost a devoted worker and a distinct personality.<br /><br />\n\"YES and NO\"<br />\nWe all recognize, more or less, vividly the comparative<br />\nlethargy that follows examination; either by the faculty, an ardent<br />\nGoucherite or a fraternity. Now that rushing season is gone we<br />\nare minus a ready and efficacious self-excuser for our conscience,<br />\nthat too well worn fallacy that after rushing season \"to work<br />\nand sane living.\" In place of this talisman we substitute a term<br />\nthat sounds well at home; \"goes over\" with some of the faculty<br />\nand has all the ear marks, but none of the drudgery, of absorbing knowledge. We call it \"browsing\" in the library. Perhaps,<br />\nin days gone it was possible in the Main Library to quite lose<br />\noneself in a perusal of a favorite book, magazine or periodical<br />\nthat catered to one's particular taste. And even now between<br />\ndisturbed glances across the library at a glaring inch or so of<br />\nflesh between a jet dress and black-colored hose, we are conscious of an occasional interest in things pedagogical.<br />\nOur interest here is rather simple; so dubious in nature that<br />\nwe hesitate to offer it. However, there is a little blue paper bound<br />\npamphlet on the horseshoe table in the Main Library that is interesting from the point of view that novelty provokes interest.<br />\nAs for example, if upon sitting down at a piano you were suddenly endowed with the power to produce sounds that were recognized as music, without previous knowledge, or acquisition of<br />\nskill. We picked up the little book to examine it, perfunctorily<br />\nas we do many foreign publications. Its title is \"Academia pro<br />\nInterlingua.\" We leaved it over and were for the next few minutes engrossed in conveying to our mind concrete, definite images.<br />\nAt first we were convinced that it was Latin\u2014but voted that assumption out since we were reading it! Which is impossible.<br />\nOn one of the pages we found the following which cleared the<br />\nfog considerably.<br />\n\"Virtutes de Interlingua.\"<br />\n\"Academia consilia pro Interlingua<br />\nVocabulario internationale, Othographia latino, sine grammatica.\"<br />\nOrthographia latino redde interlingua intelligible sine studio<br />\nad lectore que habe cognitione, et superficiale, de latino, id es ad<br />\nomne sacerdote, advocato, medico, professore, in toto mundus.<br />\nSuppressione de grammatica permitte ad lectore que ignora<br />\nlatino, de lege et scribe in IL cum auxilio de solo vocabulario<br />\nlatino.\"<br />\nWe hesitate to say more of our reaction to the book, since<br />\nwe have no desire to be identified with championing it. We wish<br />\nsimply to wonder why the idea has not been exploited further.<br />\nIs it not novel that one may pick up a book produced by Polish<br />\nfollowers, published in Torino (wherever that is) and read it<br />\nwithout hesitation or study in America? What are the chief<br />\nobjections to such a language; at least superficially, may we appeal to some member of the graduate department in Modern Languages to enlighten us.

We<br />\ndo not believe, however, that the recent open week was altogether<br />\nbad; certainly it was not useless.<br />\nNo matter how well a student knows a given fraternity before joining it, he is bound to find out later some things he was<br />\nnot aware of. It is essential that the pledge know the character<br />\nand ideals of his would-be fraternity brothers, as well as their<br />\nsocial standing. We doubt if such a knowledge can be obtained<br />\non the day of pledging.<br />\nThe question of expense to the fraternity is mentioned by<br />\nthe Editor; we are of the opinion that freshmen should pay their<br />\nown way at banquets and theatres. It is up to the fraternities<br />\nto so regulate their entertainments as not to impoverish themselves.<br />\nLastly, we believe that ideals, no matter how hazy, are a<br />\nbeneficial influence; they tend to place fraternity competition on<br />\na higher, cleaner plane.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nRUSTICUS.<br /><br />\nhoi<br /><br />\n\u201cJust Around the Corner from City Hail\"<br /><br />\n100<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY<br /><br />\nPARKWAY<br /><br />\nWest Corner Canterbury Road<br /><br />\nlittiess<br />\nwith<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, NOVEMBER 5, 1926<br />\nNEWS-LETTER MAIL-BAG<br />\nCORRESPONDENCE<br />\n(Continued from page 4, column 5)<br /><br />\nhonor of the University, the meek<br />\nand self-conscious freshman, the<br />\nsophisticated sophomore, the jovial<br />\nJunior, the serious single seniors,<br />\nand even graduate students have<br />\nbeen known to display their ignorance in the technique and theory<br />\nof this ever prevalent art.<br />\nAt sometime in the near future,<br />\n)11f<br /><br />\nvine<br /><br />\nWhen a few minutes of the after\"on hang heavily upon you, take<br />\nan observing stroll into the vicinity<br />\nof the southern Arcade.
