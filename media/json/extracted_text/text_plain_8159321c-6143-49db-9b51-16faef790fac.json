The<br />\nseminar focused on the various<br />\ndepartments of the foreign service, as well as the pros and<br />\ncons of a career overseas.<br />\nMr. Block discussed foreign<br />\nservice careers in four main<br />\nareas: political officers,<br />\neconomic officers, counselors,<br />\nand administrative officers.<br />\nBlock first addressed the<br />\nposition of political officer. A<br />\nforeign service agent in the<br />\nposition is responsible to report<br />\nand analyze the internal policies<br />\nof the host country. This type<br />\nof work is overt and the agent<br />\nis in effect \"trying to persuade<br />\nthe host government to do what<br />\nwe [the U.S.] say,\"<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to political officers, Block explained the role<br />\nof economic officers whom he<br />\nsays are responsible for the<br />\nanalysis of internal economic<br />\ndata as well as trade between<br />\nthe U.S. and the host country.<br />\nFor those interested in this area<br />\nof the foreign service, Block<br />\nrecommends a strong background in economics.<br />\nAmerican consulars are involved in several important services to both host country nationals and American citizens<br />\nabroad. They are responsible<br />\nfor the issuance of visas and<br />\npassports and other services,<br />\n(e.g., the closure of American<br />\nestates overseas).<br />\nFinally, Block said that the<br />\nadministrative officer is responsible for the efficient running of<br />\nU.S. offices in foreign countries. For example, the administrative officer serves as<br />\npersonnel officer for embassies.<br />\nBlock also spent a large part<br />\nof the hour discussing the pros<br />\n<br />\nand cons of foreign service. On<br />\nthe positive side, he emphasized the belief an agent must have<br />\n\"that a diplomatic corps can<br />\nmake a difference.\" According<br />\nto Block, the greatest positive<br />\naspect of the foreign service is<br />\nthe ability to witness great<br />\nevents firsthand.<br />\nBlock said,\"A foreign agent<br />\nhas the chance to live and work<br />\noverseas, to know intimately a<br />\nforeign culture. There is a great<br />\npsychological high when one<br />\nhas to conduct his business in<br />\na foreign language.\"<br />\nBlock also spoke candidly<br />\nabout the negative aspects involved in foreign service. The<br />\nhealth risk is a major consideration to work overseas.

Unsurprisingly, the proposal called for a drastic reduction in educational spending from FY 1985, with college<br />\nfinancial aid programs facing the most<br />\nsubstantial cuts. The budget, if passed,<br />\nwould impose severe restrictions on the<br />\namount of aid available to graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students alike.<br />\nA significant number of students at Johns<br />\nHopkins would be hurt financially under<br />\nsuch a plan and some may be forced to<br />\ndiscontinue their education altogether. Nationally, the situation is similar, particularly at independent colleges and universities.<br />\nIt would seem that such a threat to higher<br />\neducation in this country would command<br />\nimmediate and concentrated attention.<br />\nAt Hopkins, however, the concern has<br />\nbeen somewhat limited in scope. The Student Council, speaking as a representative<br />\nfor the undergraduate student body, has<br />\nissued a resolution urging Congress to \"seek<br />\nalternative means of reducing the deficit.\"<br />\nPresident Steven Muller has likewise indicated diplomatically that the proposal is<br />\nnot encouraging to institutions of higher<br />\nlearning.

Security personnel hired for the games are<br />\ninstructed to enforce this<br />\npolicy. Among the huge crowd<br />\nat the Syracuse game this past<br />\nSaturday were a number of<br />\nstudents who violated the policy<br />\nand were embarrassing to the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nAmong the reasons for prohibiting alcohol is the desire to<br />\navoid the rowdy behavior that<br />\nis sometimes induced by drinking. Some may reason that<br />\ndrinking and obnoxious<br />\nbehavior don't necessarily go<br />\nhand in hand. However, this<br />\nwas not the case at the Syracuse<br />\ngame when members of one of<br />\nour Hopkins fraternities seated<br />\non the visitors' side of<br />\nHomewood Field were identified as drinking heavily and<br />\nbringing discredit to the University by use of vulgar language<br />\nand unruly behavior. One of<br />\nour students who was standing<br />\nin front of the bleachers was hit<br />\nin the head with a full can of<br />\nbeer which was thrown by a<br />\nmember of that fraternity.

The complaints<br />\nwhich I received on the Monday<br />\nmorning after the Syracuse<br />\ngame from several alumni were<br />\nof vulgar language even more<br />\noffensive than the cheer.

Toby Mordkoff<br />\nThe Chaseki<br />\n<br />\nFrom the Coach<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLast Saturday's lacrosse<br />\ngame between Johns Hopkins<br />\nand Syracuse was a thrilling<br />\nway to open the 1985 season.<br />\nBoth teams performed admirably and the 8-6 Blue Jay<br />\nmade everyone<br />\nvictory<br />\nassociated with Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse very proud.<br />\nThere was an incident,<br />\nhowever, that took some of the<br />\nsparkle out of that great day,<br />\n<br />\nsomething I feel needs to be addressed immediately. During<br />\nthe game a cheer broke out<br />\nthat I could not believe I was<br />\nhearing, \"Syracuse Sucks.\"<br />\nSimple. Too simple for Johns<br />\nHopkins lacrosse. In the heat of<br />\nbattle, it is rare that I hear<br />\nanything specific from the fans<br />\nat Homewood. But this came<br />\nthrough loud and clear and it<br />\nwas embarrassing.<br />\nThe lacrosse team loves our<br />\nfans and appreciates the great<br />\nsupport shown to our program.<br />\nSuch support is just one example of the great tradition of<br />\nJohns Hopkins lacrosse. But<br />\nanother more important example of that tradition is class, a<br />\nword synonymous with Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse. And that cheer lacked class to say the least.<br />\nI hope that all our supporters<br />\nare proud of the way the<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team handled<br />\nthemselves on Saturday. As the<br />\ncoach, I feel the players played<br />\nhard and showed the class that<br />\nwe expect. I would hope that<br />\nour fans show the same class<br />\nand respect in the future.<br />\n<br />\nwhich was not the case. My<br />\ncandidate's statement was<br />\nreadily available; I'm sure better information could have<br />\nbeen obtained had the slightest<br />\neffort been expended.

Let me<br />\ntake this opportunity to reply.<br />\nMs. Wolford's first complaint was that I saw many of<br />\nCrane's poems as critical of<br />\n\"traditional religious values.\"<br />\nI must concede that my choice<br />\nof the word \"values\" was an<br />\nunfortunate and unintentionally misleading one. Mr. Crane,<br />\nthough very critical of traditional Christian views of our<br />\nspecies' relationship with God<br />\ndid, as Ms. Wolford pointed<br />\nout, consider many so-called<br />\n\"Christian\" values very important(as do the great majority of<br />\nus, non-Christians included.)<br />\nMs. Wolford also took exception to my interpretations of<br />\nCrane's views toward war,<br />\nespecially my contention that<br />\nMr. Crane believed that<br />\n\"courage has little to do with<br />\ncarrying a gun.\" Somehow she<br />\nhas managed to read into this<br />\nstatement the far-fetched connotation that I think that to<br />\ncarry a gun implied cowardice<br />\nin Mr. Crane's eyes. Crane's<br />\nwritings show clearly that he<br />\nadmired the courage not only<br />\nof the footsoldier, but of<br />\nanyone. The battlefield was only one of many settings the<br />\nauthor used to explore the<br />\nnature of courage. Contrary to<br />\nMs. Wolford's accusation, I<br />\nhave read The Red Badge of<br />\nCourage carefully and find particular significance in the fact<br />\nthat the protagonist, a one-time<br />\ndeserter, does not really find<br />\nthe courage he has searched for<br />\nuntil he is a flag-bearer. Ms.<br />\nWolford's very example speaks<br />\nof Crane's rather foolhardy<br />\nbravery as a war correspondant, another noncombatant<br />\nrole.<br />\nNot satisfied, Ms. Wolford<br />\nthen came to the ludicrous conclusion that to admire the<br />\nbravery of soldiers is to be<br />\nmilitaristic. Nothing could be<br />\nfurther from the truth. Many of<br />\nCrane' works, particularly his<br />\npoetry, make it clear in no<br />\n<br />\nFRED FAcToRIAI::CidDe<br />\nRovJever)I am please4 fr) reporf 414+ suicide car,<br />\nATTENDIN6<br />\nweek jrives41.5A\u2022Kon<br />\nbior KiciS mAY SEW<br />\nbe 0;101 avoided of Hopkins.

Instead of holding him in<br />\nsuch high esteem, taking his<br />\npicture, and imitating his dress,<br />\nAlec should have just ignored<br />\nhim. The punk wouldn't admit<br />\nit, but I'm sure that he loves it<br />\nwhen people take his picture.<br />\nWhy else would he dress the<br />\nway he does and make such a<br />\nspectacle of himself for<br />\neveryone to see?

Bands like REM,<br />\nTalking Heads, X, Devo,<br />\nViolent Femmes, and Los<br />\nLobos prove that the American<br />\nnew music scene is alive and<br />\nwell. There are also good<br />\nrockabilly groups like the<br />\nBlasters, the LeRoi Brothers,<br />\nand Jason and the Scorchers,<br />\nnot to mention great American<br />\nfunk like the New York \"hiphop\" scene, Washington<br />\nD.C.'s \"Go-Go\" music, and<br />\nPrince's Minneapolis sound.<br />\nI can't imagine why Alec is<br />\nashamed of being American.<br />\nThe reason many of Alec's<br />\nEnglish musical heroes criticize<br />\nAmerican music and culture is<br />\nbecause they are jealous of<br />\nAmerica's power and wealth.<br />\nThey only want what we have.<br />\nIn his article, Alec says, \"I<br />\ncan't imagine that there are<br />\npeople who spend four years in<br />\na row at JHU.\" I will spend<br />\nfour years here and although it<br />\nwould be a good experience for<br />\nme to go to England to see the<br />\ncountry and its culture, I don't<br />\nfeel I'm missing anything<br />\nmusically or socially by not going.

Each<br />\nof these varied interests are<br />\nmade possible exclusively by<br />\namateur radio. These interests<br />\nfall into several categories.<br />\nThey include: blowing away<br />\ntime talking to people on the<br />\nair, known as \"rag-chewing\";<br />\nattempting to communicate<br />\nwith hams in small or rarely<br />\ncontacted countries, called long<br />\ndistance or DX; keeping up<br />\nwith the latest technological<br />\ndevelopments,<br />\nincluding<br />\nsatellite communication and<br />\ncomputers; and relaying<br />\nmessages around the country<br />\nand the world for friends and<br />\nneighbors.<br />\n<br />\n44++++++4\u2022444.4\u20224i++++++,<br />\n<br />\nP.J.'S PUB<br />\nSt. Patrick's Day Celebration<br />\n<br />\nGreen Drafts<br />\nHarp<br />\nGuinness<br />\nJamesons<br />\nIrish Whiskey<br />\n<br />\n$1.00<br />\n<br />\nCorn Beef & Cabbage Dinner<br />\n<br />\nDX (long-distance) operating<br />\nis one of the most popular pursuits within the hobby.

For those small<br />\nislands and out-of-the-way<br />\nplaces with no operators, a<br />\ngroup of hams will occassionally go on a \"DX-pedition\" for<br />\na weekend to offer hams<br />\nworldwide the opportunity to<br />\nsnag a rare one.<br />\nFor those hams interested in<br />\nrelaying messages, \"nets\" are<br />\norganized to help them and to<br />\nmake the system more reliable<br />\nA net is simply an organized<br />\ngroup of amateurs operating on<br />\nthe air.

Currently, 400 patients a year are seen in the old,<br />\nfour-bed unit.<br />\nAmong the other conditions<br />\ntreated in the NCCU is<br />\nGuillain-Barre syndrome, a<br />\nparalyzing disorder usually triggered by a severe reaction to a<br />\nviral illness. In GBS, antibodies<br />\nthat are part of the patient's immune defense system attack the<br />\nfiber sheath that insulates nerve<br />\ncells.

Prior to this<br />\nadvance it was possible to<br />\nmeasure receptors only in postmortem brain tissue,\" said<br />\nJames J. Frost, M.D., Ph.D.,<br />\nprofessor a of<br />\nassistant<br />\nradiology.<br />\nDr. Frost led the 12-person<br />\nteam of scientists that achieved<br />\nthe first opiate receptor image<br />\nwith a positron emission<br />\ntomography (PET)scanner on<br />\nMay 25, 1984. His report,<br />\npublished in the March Journal<br />\nAssisted<br />\nof<br />\nComputer<br />\nTomography, describes the<br />\nevent and the methods used to<br />\naccomplish it.<br />\nOne of the research scientists<br />\nhimself, Henry N. Wagner, Jr.,<br />\n<br />\nM.D., was the first person to be<br />\ninjected with a new radioactive<br />\ndrug that binds to opiate receptor sites. This drug emits a tiny<br />\namount of radioactivity\u2014not<br />\nenough to harm Dr. Wagner,<br />\nbut just enough to be detected<br />\nby the PET scanner. The scanner, in turn, measures the concentration of radioactivity in a<br />\npredetermined \"slice\" of the<br />\nbrain, and depicts it as a receptor map on a computer screen.<br />\nThe brain, Dr. Frost explains, is composed largely of<br />\ncells called neurons. These consist of the cell body\u2014the main<br />\npart of the cell\u2014and long<br />\nthreadlike projections called axons. Axons serve as the brain's<br />\nwiring. An electrical impulse<br />\ntravels down the axon and ends<br />\nat the knob, a tiny bulbous<br />\nprotuberance.<br />\nThis electric impulse releases<br />\nchemicals that cross the gap<br />\nbetween brain cells. These<br />\nchemicals, called neurotransmitters, come to rest in<br />\nspecial slots, or receptors, on<br />\nneighboring brain cells. The<br />\nneurotransmitter fits into the<br />\nreceptor in much the same way<br />\na key fits into a lock.

The liver enlarges when<br />\nblood is trapped.

The procedure has<br />\nbeen performned 11 times in<br />\nnine patients with Budd-Chiari,<br />\nwhich occurs more often in<br />\nwomen. Nine of the patients<br />\nwere female.<br />\nThe procedure was repeated<br />\nin two patients because the<br />\nshunt became clogged in one<br />\npatient and collapsed in<br />\nanother.<br />\nAlthough uncommon, BuddChiari may be increasing due to<br />\nthe widespread use of estrogen<br />\nbirth control pills.

Having roommates<br />\nof such diverse backgrounds<br />\ncan be a lot of fun, especially<br />\nwhen comedies arise from the<br />\nmisunderstandings due to<br />\ncultural clashes.<br />\nI, being the average<br />\nAmerican female, tacked up<br />\nsome pictures of male models<br />\non the bulletin board. The pictures were from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune's Sunday<br />\nmagazine and featured the sensual backs of models from<br />\nDayton's department store.<br />\nThe article was titled, \"The<br />\nBeefcake Industry\". Neither<br />\none of my roommates knew the<br />\nterm. I explained: \"You know,<br />\na hunk.\" My roommate from<br />\nBaltimore, Stephanie, caught<br />\non right away, but Jeanne,<br />\nfrom Hong Kong, continued to<br />\nstare at me blankly.<br />\nThis happens often in our<br />\napartment, particularly concerning men. I don't claim to<br />\nknow everything about men,<br />\nbut I grew up with an older<br />\nbrother and some guys ask me<br />\nout from time to time.<br />\nStephanie and Jeanne leave it<br />\nup to me to talk about men<br />\nbecause I amuse them with my<br />\nstories. I come home from a<br />\nfrat party and the first thing<br />\nthey want to know is who ap-<br />\n<br />\nproached me and what he looked like. You should have seen<br />\nJeanne's eyes widen when I told<br />\nher about the guy I'd never seen<br />\nbefore who stopped in front of<br />\nme, ran his hand through my<br />\nhair, and then introduced<br />\nhimself. The American male is<br />\na species apart, with or without<br />\nwords.<br />\nMen aren't the only thing in<br />\nthe world to talk and laugh<br />\nabout. Sometimes, language<br />\nitself provides us a source of<br />\nI<br />\nspeak<br />\namusement.<br />\nMidwestern English and constantly use slang words.<br />\nStephanie and I understand<br />\neach other, even though some<br />\nof our terms don't coincide.<br />\nFor instance, she says \"soda,\"<br />\nI say \"pop\"; she says \"pocketbook,\" I say \"purse,\" etc. We<br />\nrarely misunderstand each<br />\nother because we know how to<br />\nother's<br />\neach<br />\ntranslate<br />\n\"Americanese\".<br />\nBut Jeanne doesn't know the<br />\nins and outs of \"Americanese\".<br />\nShe's always the victim of my<br />\nslang talk. Yesterday, the three<br />\nof us sat in the living room<br />\ndiscussing sleep habits. I asked<br />\nif she had ever had a crick in<br />\nher neck. As soon as I said the<br />\nword, I knew I was in trouble.<br />\nJeanne's blank stare greeted<br />\nme. Luckily, Stephanie helped<br />\nout and described crick without<br />\nusing slang.<br />\nSpeaking of explanations,<br />\n<br />\nwhen I tried to define \"hunk\"<br />\nfor Jeanne, she thought I said<br />\n\"hulk,\" bringing to mind a picture of Bill Bixby. Then she<br />\nthought I said \"chunk.\" I guess<br />\nthat's logical when you tie it<br />\ntogether with beefcake.<br />\nLaughing, I said, \"No, we<br />\ndon't call them 'chunks,'<br />\nalthough a man can be chunky,<br />\nmeaning he's overweight.\"<br />\nOf course, misunderstandings can work the other way<br />\ntoo. Jeanne asked me how my<br />\n\"year\" was now. My spoonful<br />\nof Grape Nuts stopped midway<br />\nto my mouth. Why did she ask<br />\nme that question? It was only<br />\nthe end of January, not long<br />\nenough to determine what 1986<br />\nwould be like yet. Besides,<br />\nthat's not the kind of question<br />\nyou ask during breakfast. She<br />\nrepeated her question, this time<br />\npointing to her ear. I wondered<br />\nif she had an earache. Suddenly, it dawned on me.\"Oh, you<br />\nmean my ear.\" She nodded,<br />\nwondering what else I could<br />\nhave been thinking. I said, \"I<br />\nthought you said 'year' instead<br />\nof 'ear'.\" We both started<br />\nlaughing. It took her about ten<br />\nrepetitions before she could say<br />\n\"ear\" without a y-sound. Now,<br />\nshe carefully pronounces \"ear\"<br />\nand \"year.\"<br />\nI've really enjoyed living with<br />\nmy roommates from Baltimore<br />\nand Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, there is a marked<br />\ntendency among the Administration, and even among<br />\nthe students themselves, to<br />\ndown-play this aspect of the<br />\nschool\u2014\"Hey, if you wanted a<br />\nfour-year party, you should<br />\nhave gone to----(fill in the name<br />\nof an Ivy League school that rejected you).\" As Steve Muller<br />\nput it in his orientation<br />\nstatistical analysis, \"I'm glad<br />\nyour SATs are the highest in<br />\nour history, because you are<br />\ncertainly the ugliest class in a<br />\nlong while...

In a nutshell,<br />\nan important function of most<br />\ncolleges is to serve as a breeding<br />\nground.<br />\nThere is not much breeding<br />\ngoing on at Hopkins. Intense<br />\nacademic pressure and angst<br />\nover future careers combine to<br />\nconvince many of use that we<br />\nsimply don't have time for an<br />\nintense relationship. \"The lady<br />\nor the tiger\" becomes \"the lady<br />\nor the term paper.\"<br />\nOne unfortunate consequence is that Hopkins men,<br />\ndespite the laudable efforts of<br />\nthe Feminist Alliance, feel they<br />\nsimply don't have the time to<br />\nconsider women as more than<br />\nsex objects. In the Levering<br />\ncafeteria last week, I overheard<br />\none Hopkins man excitedly<br />\npostulate that the ideal Hopkins<br />\nwoman \"doesn't want any<br />\ncommitment, is on the pill, is<br />\nincredible in bed, and at two<br />\no'clock turns into a pizza.\"<br />\nWhere breeding is concerned,<br />\nthe pick-up line is as far as<br />\nmany of us get. Herein lies the<br />\ndanger of the new legislation<br />\nto the students of Johns<br />\nHopkins: it's bad enough to be<br />\ncaught on the pre-professional<br />\ntrack; now, we won't even be<br />\nable to take detours.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\n<br />\nReturn of the Crazy U.B.

What are we<br />\ntalking about? Why, the<br />\nMarch-of-Dimes Dance-a-thon,<br />\nof course.<br />\nBesides raising money for<br />\nbirth-defects research, the<br />\nDance-a-thon offers a few<br />\n<br />\nperks for participating students<br />\nas well. $2000 worth of prizes<br />\nwill be given away to dancers<br />\nwhich range from albums and<br />\ntapes to free restaurant dinners<br />\nfor two. If my fleet-footed<br />\nroommates, who danced last<br />\nyear, are any indication, just<br />\nabout everyone limps home<br />\nricher. This year Chairman Jeff<br />\nRothfeld will award a 19-inch<br />\ncolor TV to the official student<br />\ngroup which raises the most<br />\nmoney for the cause.<br />\n<br />\nSo, you think dancing for 24<br />\nhours is tough? Think about<br />\nthe long hours you've spent<br />\nwith one textbook! Like last<br />\nyear, professional and student<br />\nDJs will spin a variety of dance<br />\ntunes at varying speeds to help<br />\nthe 24 hours rush by. At JHU's<br />\npremier dance event, dressing<br />\nfor comfort is key, but chic<br />\nshould not be forgotten. Flat<br />\nshoes are a good bet, when<br />\npaired with loose-fitting cottons; say a teeshirt and flashy<br />\n<br />\nboxers or a miniskirt. People<br />\nwill definitely be looking at<br />\nyou.<br />\nAnother asset to this year's<br />\nDance-a-thon is open registration. Students from Goucher<br />\nand Notre Dame are being actively recruited, so don't worry<br />\nabout having only your lab<br />\npartner to dance with. In addition, TV cameras may focus on<br />\nyou like they did in 1984. Last<br />\nyear's dancers even made<br />\nGames- ma(!azine!<br />\n<br />\nThe Dance-a-thon will run<br />\nfrom 9 p.m. on Friday, April<br />\n12, through 9 p.m. Saturday<br />\nthe 13th.

A Broadway musical<br />\nclassic, West Side Story<br />\nreplaces the Capulets and the<br />\nMontagues with the Jets and<br />\nthe Sharks, and retells the story<br />\nof Romeo and Juliet in the<br />\nviolent streets of New York<br />\nCity.<br />\nThis production is completely student produced and is quite<br />\ngood overall. Faced with a<br />\nseries of complications and setbacks, including conflicts with<br />\nthe original hired director, the<br />\ncast managed to pull themselves<br />\nthrough and capture the spirit<br />\nof the play: violent, tender, farcical, and mournful at various<br />\npoints.<br />\nStudent directors Mary<br />\nDonofrio, Matthew Gertzog<br />\nand Jim Sullivan were eventually responsible for putting the<br />\nshow together. Assisting them<br />\nwas choreographer Anton<br />\nMack. The choreography was<br />\nrather strong throughout,<br />\nespecially so in the numbers<br />\n\"Gee, Officer Krupke,\"<br />\n\"Dance at the Gym,\" and in<br />\nthe fateful rumble at the end of<br />\n<br />\nAct I.<br />\nAlso strong was the orchestra, conducted by freshman<br />\nSteve Gayler, which, after a<br />\nrocky start, came together and<br />\nset the tone. The music accompanying the fight scenes was<br />\nparticularly effective as the<br />\npiano clashed with trumpet<br />\nblasts while the Jets and Sharks<br />\nwere locking horns onstage.<br />\nHowever, during the second<br />\nnumber, \"The Jet Song,\" the<br />\nband seemed to be playing one<br />\nsong, and the Jets singing<br />\nanother; the actors had trouble<br />\nsinging in unison, and could<br />\nbarely be heard over the music.<br />\nFollowing this scene, which occurs at the beginning of Act I,<br />\nthis reporter thought he was in<br />\nfor a long night.<br />\nThese fears were put to rest<br />\nwith the appearance of the<br />\nRomeo-like Tony (Brian Doyle)<br />\nwhose rendition of the solo<br />\n\"Something's Coming\" came<br />\nnear to literally bringing down<br />\nthe house.(More accurately, it<br />\nwas the backdrop that fell.) Indeed, Doyle's portrayal of<br />\nTony was one of several excellent performances.<br />\nJim Sullivan, who plays Riff,<br />\nthe Jets' leader, was absent for<br />\nthe show on which this review<br />\nis based. Jim Sullivan is a virtual synonym for Hopkins thespianism, and the talent and ex-<br />\n<br />\nperience that he could have lent<br />\nto the character of Riff were<br />\nundoubtedly missed. Filling in<br />\nfor him was understudy Dale<br />\nBell who performed very commendably although he did not<br />\nquite sing loudly enough. For<br />\nthe other performances Bell<br />\nplays Jet member In/Out.<br />\nWhile the whole cast was<br />\nsolid, there are several whose<br />\nperformances deserve special<br />\nrecognition. Laurence Milgram<br />\nwas excellent as Action, a<br />\nmember of the Jets. Following<br />\nRiff's death, he becomes the de<br />\nfacto leader of the gang,<br />\nleading the Jets in a terrifically<br />\nspirited rendition of \"Gee, Officer Krupke.\"<br />\nThe Sharks had their terrifically spirited number as<br />\nwell. Theirs is \"America\"<br />\nwhich spells out the Sharks'<br />\npredicament of being a minority discriminated against (Puerto Ricans)in what is supposedly a land of opportunity.<br />\nHighlighting this number was<br />\nTara Allmen as Anita, the<br />\ngirlfriend of the leader of the<br />\nSharks. Allmen, in the second<br />\nfemale lead, sang and acted<br />\nwith feeling and believability in<br />\nboth acts.<br />\nThe indisputable star of the<br />\nshow, however, was Amy<br />\nFrances Reiter playing Maria,<br />\nTony's Puerto Rican girlfriend.<br />\n<br />\nBlade Runner at the BMA<br />\nby Steve Brett<br />\nBlade Runner will be playing<br />\ntonight at the Film Forum of<br />\nthe Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nAs part of their \"Close-Up\"<br />\nseries, the screening will be<br />\nfollowed by a discussion of the<br />\nwork from a psychoanalytic<br />\npoint of view by a qualified<br />\nmedical doctor. Not bad, considering the poor reviews the<br />\nfilm received upon its initial<br />\nrelease.<br />\nIn the wake of his latest hit,<br />\nWitness, a recent issue of Time<br />\nmagazine described Blade Runner's Harrison Ford as being<br />\nvirtual box office gold:\". .. he<br />\nhas not only got it, but got it<br />\nbig enough to draw lines that<br />\nstretch around the block and into the next galaxy.\" Of course,<br />\nwho else but Ford could make<br />\nthe claim of starring in five of<br />\nthe highest grossing movies of<br />\nall time? Witness itself is quite<br />\na success as well: it was the<br />\nnumber two movie in the<br />\nBaltimore area last week, second only to Beverly Hills Cop,<br />\nand it is faring similarly well nationwide. But it may not be Mr.<br />\nFord that gets the long lines as<br />\nit is Mr. Solo of Star Wars or<br />\nDr. Jones of Raiders of the<br />\nLost Ark. Ford's name attached to such films as Force Ten<br />\nFrom Navaronne or Hanover<br />\nStreet provided no guarantee of<br />\nsuccess for these critical and<br />\nbox office failures.<br />\nBlade Runner, like the many<br />\nother Ford also-rans, received<br />\ntepid reviews and performed<br />\ncorrespondingly at the box of-<br />\n<br />\nfice upon its original release in<br />\n1982. But, since its first appearance, Blade Runner continues to be shown time and<br />\nagain in theaters such as New<br />\nYork City's revival houses, and<br />\nit has been Thursday's midnight movie in Greenwich<br />\nVillage's St. Marks Place<br />\nCinema for over two years.<br />\nWhat are people currently<br />\nreading into Blade Runner that<br />\nits original critics failed to see?<br />\nActually, an easier question<br />\nto start with may be, \"What's<br />\nthe difference between science<br />\nfiction such as Star Wars or<br />\nStar Trek or 2001: A Space<br />\nOdyssey or Blade Runner?\"<br />\nWithout a doubt, the differences abound, but one difference is obvious from the<br />\nstart: time. Star Wars and Star<br />\nTrek may take place in totally<br />\ndifferent periods (a long time<br />\nago and the 23rd century,<br />\nrespectively), but what they do<br />\nshare is the fact that a viewer of<br />\ntoday will be unable to attest to<br />\nthe truth of the visions they present. It will always be possible<br />\nthat a Star Wars-like saga, or<br />\neven the technology necessary<br />\nfor one, occurred or existed \"a<br />\nlong time ago in a galaxy far,<br />\nfar away;\" there is no way to<br />\nknow for sure. Similarly, unless<br />\ncryogenics sees significant advancement in the near future, it<br />\nis doubtful that any contemporary viewer will live to see<br />\nwhether there will be<br />\ntransporters, phasers, warp<br />\ndrive, and Klingons as in Gene<br />\nRoddenberry's 23rd century.<br />\nBut, of course, this is all fiction<br />\nmeant for entertainment, not<br />\n<br />\nintended to be actual predictions of the future (or, in the<br />\ncase of the Star Wars films,<br />\nhistory lessons).<br />\nThe near-future films, such<br />\nas 2001 or Blade Runner(which<br />\ntakes place in 2019) are different. Stanley Kubrick and<br />\nRidley Scott, directors of 2001<br />\nand Blade Runner, respectively, must have both realized that<br />\na significant portion of viewers<br />\nwould live to see whether or not<br />\nthese pictures of the near-future<br />\nwould be accurate. Neither film<br />\npresents a particularly flattering<br />\nimage, but these two images are<br />\nquite distinct. And it is the view<br />\npresented in Blade Runner<br />\nwhich, even if exaggerated,<br />\nlooks like it may be closer to the<br />\ngeneral direction in which city<br />\nlife is heading.<br />\nThe Los Angeles of 2019 is<br />\nfilthy, wet, smoggy, and<br />\ndisgusting. Thanks to the<br />\ntechnology made available by<br />\n2019, the clutter of advertising<br />\nis virtually inescapable in this<br />\nmuggy, claustrophobic city.<br />\nThe immense billboards fly,<br />\ntalk, sing, annoy; they are<br />\nalmost constantly seen or<br />\nheard, and when they are not,<br />\nthey at least seem to be. The<br />\nsenses are constantly assaulted,<br />\nand Ridley Scott, who also<br />\ndirected Alien, executes this atmosphere so perfectly that even<br />\nin a cool, roomy theater, a<br />\nviewer just might find him or<br />\nherself feeling hot, sweaty,<br />\novercrowded, and tense.<br />\nThe biggest building in this<br />\nL.A. houses the Tyrell Corporation, a mega-conglomerate<br />\nContinued on Page 20<br />\n<br />\nWith her powerful voice and as<br />\nmany solos as she had, she<br />\ncould have stolen the show.

Despite its short<br />\nlife, the art deco movement left<br />\nits mark not only in furniture<br />\nand glass, but also in fashion<br />\nand architecture (think Chrysler<br />\nbuilding).<br />\nThe exhibit at the BMA,<br />\nhowever, focuses primarily on<br />\nfurniture and glass. The works<br />\nof five of the best known art<br />\ndeco cabinet makers are<br />\nfeatured, with emphasis on<br />\npieces by Emile-Jacques<br />\nRuhlmann, probably the most<br />\nfamous of all the French<br />\ncabinet makers at that time.<br />\nRuhlmann is known for his<br />\n\"elegance of line,\" which is apparent in such a variety of<br />\n<br />\npieces as his box-like cabinets<br />\nperching on four dainty,<br />\ntoothpick-like legs, to his<br />\nbathtub of a bed, with matching night table and chairs. In<br />\nsome pieces, elements of<br />\nclassicism are apparent, while<br />\nthe bigger pieces suggest<br />\nstreamlined industrialism, complete with ultra-shiny lacquered<br />\nfinish. These aspects are also<br />\nvisible in pieces by other artists,<br />\nsuch as the wood desk with the<br />\none large, cylindrical chrome<br />\nleg.<br />\nA variety of glass vases is<br />\nalso included in the exhibition.<br />\nThe vases tend towards big and<br />\nthick, with decorations molded<br />\ninto or painted onto them.<br />\nThese designs range from ancient Egyptian motifs, to colorful geometric designs that bring<br />\nthe Cubist movement to mind.<br />\nSome of the jewelry and<br />\ncigarette cases in one corner of<br />\nthe exhibition are also worth<br />\ntaking a look at. Especially in<br />\nthe compacts are the geometric<br />\npatterns of the art deco movement so obvious.<br />\nThe art deco exhibit will be<br />\nin the Thalheimer galleries of<br />\nthe BMA through April. It offers a concise glimpse into this<br />\ncurrently fashionable movement.

Led by senior<br />\ntri-captain Larry Quinn, the<br />\nsquad shut down Syracuse alleverything Tim Nelson and<br />\nquieted the usually explosive<br />\nOrange offense. With this<br />\nbehind them, freshman Mike<br />\nMorrill broke a fourth quarter<br />\ntie and sophomore Jack<br />\nCrawford scored the insurance<br />\ngoal to bring the Jays their first<br />\nvictory of the season.<br />\nHopkins versus Syracuse.<br />\nAlready a tremendous rivalry,<br />\nthis game had it all: offensive<br />\nfirepower; aggressive, swarming defense; hard hitting all-out<br />\nplay; outstanding individual efforts; and the inevitable sharp<br />\nswings of momentum. The<br />\nmost highly-awaited game of<br />\nthe season, it was a virtual<br />\nrematch of the squads which<br />\nhad met nearly ten months<br />\n<br />\nLarry Volz<br />\n<br />\nBrian Wood scores his second goal of the game past Syracuse goalie Tom Nims.<br />\n<br />\nbefore at the 1984 NCAA<br />\nChampionsip Game in Newark,<br />\nDelaware.<br />\nIn many ways, the match-up<br />\nfulfilled the expectations of the<br />\nnearly 8,200 fans who packed<br />\nthe Conrad Geblein stands and<br />\nalmost all of the available stan-<br />\n<br />\nding room. While neither<br />\nHopkins nor Syracuse were as<br />\npolished as they had been dur<br />\ning the title game, both team<br />\ndisplayed the talent and abilit<br />\nwhich earned them the numbe<br />\none and two preseason rank<br />\nings, respectively.<br />\n<br />\nFreshman Mike Morrill scored his first goal as a Blue Jay Saturday, the game winner.<br />\n<br />\nLarry Volz<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays set the tempo for<br />\nthe first quarter as senior Greg<br />\nMatthews won the opening<br />\nfaceoff from Syracuse's Brad<br />\nKotz. Setting up for the score,<br />\nHopkins found the Orangeman<br />\ndefense to be quite effective. As<br />\nattackman Brian Wood drove<br />\nto the net, he was quickly stripped of the ball by defenseman<br />\nSheehan.<br />\nThe<br />\nKevin<br />\nOrangemen immediately looked for the fast break and tried<br />\nto push the ball upfield. Their<br />\nattack was unable to handle a<br />\nhigh pass, however, and<br />\nHopkins regained control.<br />\nThe next two trips downfield<br />\nproved equally fruitless for the<br />\nJays, as Sheehan appeared to<br />\nhave Wood's number, easily<br />\nstick-checking him and causing<br />\nthe turnover. Syracuse, though,<br />\nwas also unable to connect on<br />\nits clearing passes and its offense never had control of the<br />\nball.<br />\nActually, the Orange starting<br />\nten appeared to be more<br />\nunsettled than unprepared to<br />\nplay. \"Anytime you play on<br />\nHomewood Field for the first<br />\ntime you're going to be nervous,\" commented Matthews.<br />\nAfter nearly four scoreless<br />\nminutes, the Blue Jays finally<br />\nfound an opening. Syracuse, in<br />\nan attempt to regain control of<br />\nthe game, brought in six long<br />\nsticks to ride Hopkins' clear.<br />\nThe move backfired, however,<br />\nas the Jays quickly cleared the<br />\nball, finding Wood alone on the<br />\nfly. Streaking by three<br />\ndefenders, Wood cut in front of<br />\n<br />\nthe net and deposited the first<br />\ngoal of the game past a helpless<br />\nTom Nims.<br />\nFifty seconds later, Wood<br />\nstruck again, scooping up a<br />\nmishandled clearing pass and<br />\nbreaking in alone on Nims for<br />\nhis second unassisted goal.<br />\nBy now, the Syracuse defense<br />\nwas obviously pressing. Playing<br />\nexceedingly cautious and often<br />\ndropping the ball, the<br />\nOrangemen were having trouble breaking through the tough<br />\nBlue Jay ride. Without their<br />\nbread-and-butter transition<br />\ngame, Syracuse was also unable<br />\nto mount an effective offensive<br />\nthreat.<br />\nLess than two minutes would<br />\npass before another unsuccessful clear would prove costly. This time it was midfielder<br />\nDel Dressel, who stripped a<br />\nSyracuse defender as he received an outlet pass from Nims.<br />\nThe ball then quickly found<br />\nitself on the stick of sophomore<br />\nattackman Craig Bubier. Taking a step towards the crease,<br />\nBubier immediately spotted<br />\nWood cutting in front of the<br />\ngoal. A second later the score<br />\nwas 3-0.<br />\nDominating at midfield, the<br />\nJays were able to contain the<br />\nSyracuse transition game while<br />\nmaintaining constant pressure<br />\non the Orange goal. \"We were<br />\nrelentless,\" said defensive middie Brad McLam, \"We made<br />\nthem work for the ball and kept<br />\nthem in a half-field game.\"<br />\nContinued on Pare 24<br />\n<br />\n\f.

The game was originally<br />\nscheduled to be at Notre Dame,<br />\nbut a last minute switch<br />\nbrought the contest to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBrill and McFarland were the<br />\nkey offensive players for the<br />\nJays, as each tallied three goals.<br />\nAll three of McFarland's scores<br />\ncame in the second half with the<br />\ngame on the line. Brill scored<br />\nonly one goal, the Jays' eighth,<br />\nafter intermission, and that<br />\n<br />\nNotre Dame struck out to a 4-2<br />\nadvantage. The Jays re<br />\ngrouped, though, and by halftime they had gained the<br />\nmomentum and pulled to<br />\nwithin one, at 5-4. Brill had two<br />\ngoals during the period, while<br />\nfreshman Heather Klink and<br />\njunior transfer Eileen Janec<br />\nadded one each.<br />\nIn the second half, the Jays<br />\nbegan to control the ball, and<br />\nthey managed to parlay this advantage into goals. Freshman<br />\nJennifer Stahl got things going<br />\nearly on as she put one in to tie<br />\nthe game at 5. The Gators<br />\nresponded quickly with a score<br />\nthat put them up 6-5, but the<br />\nJays responded with three<br />\nstraight, a streak that gave them<br />\na lead that they would not relinquish.

The<br />\nGators protested the goal,<br />\nhowever, claiming that Klink<br />\nhad used an illegal stick. Before<br />\nshe let the referee see the stick,<br />\nKlink tugged on the strings, not<br />\nknowing that this was illegal<br />\nduring such a procedure.

Suddenly, the Blue Jay offense was<br />\nsilenced, despite the multitude<br />\nof opportunities. Syracuse also<br />\nscored its first goal as Kotz took<br />\nan Emmitt Printup feed and<br />\nblew the ball past Quinn.<br />\nThe tide was turning, but<br />\nthere was a period of slack<br />\nwater during which neither<br />\nteam could dominate or score.<br />\nLate in the period, when<br />\nHopkins gained a two man advantage, it looked as though the<br />\n.4 ill<br />\ni<br />\nBlue Jays would be able to reil<br />\n4***<br />\njuvenate their offense.

With<br />\nless than a minute to play,<br />\nSyracuse cashed in its gift, as<br />\nattackman Tom Nelson tossed<br />\nin a loose ball in front of the<br />\nSophomore<br />\ncrease, making the score 4-2,<br />\nHopkins. Quinn had come out trouble.<br />\nOnce again, however, it was<br />\nof the net to stuff a Printup<br />\nshot, but was unable to scoop Wood to the rescue.

The difference this time was Syracuse's<br />\ninability to shake the tough<br />\nBlue Jay man-to-man defensive<br />\npressure. With defenseman<br />\nJohn DeTommaso denying Tim<br />\nNelson the opportunity to drive<br />\nor feed to the crease, the<br />\nSyracuse \"spaghetti\" offense<br />\nwas nearly completely shut<br />\ndown.<br />\n\"The first time [Tim] Nelson<br />\nwent to the goal, there were<br />\nover ten minutes gone,\" said<br />\ngoalie Quinn. \"We were concerned with Nelson's feeding,<br />\nbut we worked harder than we<br />\never have for the first three<br />\nweeks.

Not surprisingly, it<br />\nwas Tim Nelson providing the<br />\nspark as he fed Printup and<br />\nsophomore Gordon Mapes for<br />\ncrease-area scores to give the<br />\nOrangemen the tie at five goals<br />\napiece.<br />\nThe Blue Jays refused to<br />\nabandon ship and reclaimed the<br />\nlead as Bubier scored on a solo<br />\ndrive to the Orange goal. Three<br />\nminutes later Syracuse again<br />\ntied the score as junior midfielder Eric Jeschke put home<br />\nan unassisted goal. With only<br />\nseven minutes to play, the game<br />\nwas up for grabs.<br />\nHaving the Homewood<br />\ncrowd behind them, the Jays<br />\ndug deep for that little extra<br />\nwhich would pull them<br />\nthrough. They found it with<br />\nless than four minutes to play.<br />\nQuickly working the ball<br />\naround the perimeter, Del<br />\nDressel soon spotted attackman<br />\nMike Morrill perched in front<br />\nof the Syracuse crease. Receiving a perfect pass, Morrill then<br />\nfought off two Orange<br />\ndefenders and deposited the<br />\ngame winner past Nims.<br />\nOne minute later the Jays<br />\nwould seal their victory as<br />\nsophomore midfielder Jack<br />\nCrawford made another one of<br />\nhis usually outstanding efforts.<br />\nAs Nims lunged for the rebound of a wood crank shot,<br />\nCrawford dove and slid along<br />\nthe turf, just managing to poke<br />\nit past him.<br />\nAs time quickly drifted away,<br />\nSyracuse would attempt, in<br />\nvain, to score again. Once the<br />\nBlue Jays regained possession,<br />\nthough, they were content to<br />\npass the ball around and not try<br />\nto score. In fact, the Jays had<br />\nseveral prime opportunities for<br />\na ninth goal, but continued to<br />\nfrustrate Syracuse with a \"keep<br />\naway\" offense, much to the<br />\ndelight of Hopkins' fans.<br />\n\"We've been working hard,\"<br />\nsaid Zimmerman. \"It was a real<br />\ndogfight, but we were able to<br />\nreach back and bring it out.<br />\nThe defense won the game for<br />\nus.\" Zimmerman awarded<br />\ngameballs to Morrill, Pallace,<br />\nDeTommaso, and Quinn.<br />\n<br />\nLarry Volz<br />\n<br />\n\"Everyone played so well,\"<br />\ncommented DeTommaso.\"We<br />\ngot the four goals early and we<br />\nfelt more confident.

There is also an enormous amount of personal strain<br /><br />\non the family and spouse of the<br />\nforeign agent.<br />\nHowever, the most serious<br />\nreservation according to Block,<br />\nis the \"tension between<br />\nobligated loyalty to the policy<br />\nof the current administration<br />\nand your own political ideas.\"<br />\nA person who cannot obey<br />\norders when opposed to personal feelings should not consider a foreign service career.<br />\nIf one is interested in studying a career in the foreign service, he will first serve a four<br />\nyear probationary period after<br />\npassing the foreign service exam.

The budget, if passed,<br />\nwould impose severe restrictions on the<br />\namount of aid available to graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students alike.<br />\nA significant number of students at Johns<br />\nHopkins would be hurt financially under<br />\nsuch a plan and some may be forced to<br />\ndiscontinue their education altogether.

The Student Council, speaking as a representative<br />\nfor the undergraduate student body, has<br />\nissued a resolution urging Congress to \"seek<br />\nalternative means of reducing the deficit.\"<br />\nPresident Steven Muller has likewise indicated diplomatically that the proposal is<br />\nnot encouraging to institutions of higher<br />\nlearning.

Since<br />\nthere were no other seats to be<br />\nhad, he was forced to leave the<br />\ngame at halftime.<br />\nI have personally spoken to<br />\nthe officers of the fraternity involved in this behavior.

Toby Mordkoff<br />\nThe Chaseki<br /><br />\nFrom the Coach<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLast Saturday's lacrosse<br />\ngame between Johns Hopkins<br />\nand Syracuse was a thrilling<br />\nway to open the 1985 season.<br />\nBoth teams performed admirably and the 8-6 Blue Jay<br />\nmade everyone<br />\nvictory<br />\nassociated with Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse very proud.<br />\nThere was an incident,<br />\nhowever, that took some of the<br />\nsparkle out of that great day,<br /><br />\nsomething I feel needs to be addressed immediately. During<br />\nthe game a cheer broke out<br />\nthat I could not believe I was<br />\nhearing, \"Syracuse Sucks.\"<br />\nSimple. Too simple for Johns<br />\nHopkins lacrosse. In the heat of<br />\nbattle, it is rare that I hear<br />\nanything specific from the fans<br />\nat Homewood. But this came<br />\nthrough loud and clear and it<br />\nwas embarrassing.<br />\nThe lacrosse team loves our<br />\nfans and appreciates the great<br />\nsupport shown to our program.<br />\nSuch support is just one example of the great tradition of<br />\nJohns Hopkins lacrosse. But<br />\nanother more important example of that tradition is class, a<br />\nword synonymous with Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse. And that cheer lacked class to say the least.<br />\nI hope that all our supporters<br />\nare proud of the way the<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team handled<br />\nthemselves on Saturday. As the<br />\ncoach, I feel the players played<br />\nhard and showed the class that<br />\nwe expect. I would hope that<br />\nour fans show the same class<br />\nand respect in the future.<br /><br />\nwhich was not the case. My<br />\ncandidate's statement was<br />\nreadily available; I'm sure better information could have<br />\nbeen obtained had the slightest<br />\neffort been expended. In an<br />\nelection this close, such a<br />\nbiased-seeming \"article\" could<br />\nhave a major impact.

Let me<br />\ntake this opportunity to reply.<br />\nMs. Wolford's first complaint was that I saw many of<br />\nCrane's poems as critical of<br />\n\"traditional religious values.\"<br />\nI must concede that my choice<br />\nof the word \"values\" was an<br />\nunfortunate and unintentionally misleading one. Mr. Crane,<br />\nthough very critical of traditional Christian views of our<br />\nspecies' relationship with God<br />\ndid, as Ms. Wolford pointed<br />\nout, consider many so-called<br />\n\"Christian\" values very important(as do the great majority of<br />\nus, non-Christians included.)<br />\nMs. Wolford also took exception to my interpretations of<br />\nCrane's views toward war,<br />\nespecially my contention that<br />\nMr. Crane believed that<br />\n\"courage has little to do with<br />\ncarrying a gun.\" Somehow she<br />\nhas managed to read into this<br />\nstatement the far-fetched connotation that I think that to<br />\ncarry a gun implied cowardice<br />\nin Mr. Crane's eyes. Crane's<br />\nwritings show clearly that he<br />\nadmired the courage not only<br />\nof the footsoldier, but of<br />\nanyone. The battlefield was only one of many settings the<br />\nauthor used to explore the<br />\nnature of courage. Contrary to<br />\nMs. Wolford's accusation, I<br />\nhave read The Red Badge of<br />\nCourage carefully and find particular significance in the fact<br />\nthat the protagonist, a one-time<br />\ndeserter, does not really find<br />\nthe courage he has searched for<br />\nuntil he is a flag-bearer. Ms.<br />\nWolford's very example speaks<br />\nof Crane's rather foolhardy<br />\nbravery as a war correspondant, another noncombatant<br />\nrole.<br />\nNot satisfied, Ms. Wolford<br />\nthen came to the ludicrous conclusion that to admire the<br />\nbravery of soldiers is to be<br />\nmilitaristic. Nothing could be<br />\nfurther from the truth. Many of<br />\nCrane' works, particularly his<br />\npoetry, make it clear in no<br /><br />\nFRED FAcToRIAI::CidDe<br />\nRovJever)I am please4 fr) reporf 414+ suicide car,<br />\nATTENDIN6<br />\nweek jrives41.5A\u2022Kon<br />\nbior KiciS mAY SEW<br />\nbe 0;101 avoided of Hopkins.

Instead of holding him in<br />\nsuch high esteem, taking his<br />\npicture, and imitating his dress,<br />\nAlec should have just ignored<br />\nhim. The punk wouldn't admit<br />\nit, but I'm sure that he loves it<br />\nwhen people take his picture.<br />\nWhy else would he dress the<br />\nway he does and make such a<br />\nspectacle of himself for<br />\neveryone to see?

Bands like REM,<br />\nTalking Heads, X, Devo,<br />\nViolent Femmes, and Los<br />\nLobos prove that the American<br />\nnew music scene is alive and<br />\nwell.

What<br />\nabout talking to your family at<br />\nhome without worrying about<br />\nlong-distance telephone calls?<br />\nPerhaps you like public service,<br />\nor helping out in disasters. Or<br />\nmaybe you are an EE major. If<br />\nany, all, or none of these things<br />\napplies to you, you may be interested in getting an amateur<br />\nradio license.<br />\nThe scope of the amateur<br />\nradio \"hobby\" is enormous;<br />\nvirtually everyone can find an<br />\naspect that is appealing. Contrary to what many think,<br />\n\"ham\" radio operators are not<br />\na bunch of middle-aged men,<br />\nhandy with electronics, who<br />\nlike to fiddle with glowing<br />\nvacuum tubes after dinner.<br /><br />\nUnlike post hobbies there is no<br />\nparticular common purpose<br />\nthat unites all hams. Instead,<br />\nthere are many overlapping<br />\ngroups, in the ham community,<br />\nof individual operators pursuing, to whatever degree they<br />\nwish, their own interests. Each<br />\nof these varied interests are<br />\nmade possible exclusively by<br />\namateur radio. These interests<br />\nfall into several categories.<br />\nThey include: blowing away<br />\ntime talking to people on the<br />\nair, known as \"rag-chewing\";<br />\nattempting to communicate<br />\nwith hams in small or rarely<br />\ncontacted countries, called long<br />\ndistance or DX; keeping up<br />\nwith the latest technological<br />\ndevelopments,<br />\nincluding<br />\nsatellite communication and<br />\ncomputers; and relaying<br />\nmessages around the country<br />\nand the world for friends and<br />\nneighbors.<br /><br />\n44++++++4\u2022444.4\u20224i++++++,<br /><br />\nP.J.'S PUB<br />\nSt. Patrick's Day Celebration<br /><br />\nGreen Drafts<br />\nHarp<br />\nGuinness<br />\nJamesons<br />\nIrish Whiskey<br /><br />\n$1.00<br /><br />\nCorn Beef &amp; Cabbage Dinner<br /><br />\nDX (long-distance) operating<br />\nis one of the most popular pursuits within the hobby.

Even the beginners,<br />\nhowever, with a modest<br />\namount of patience, can communicate with all the European<br />\ncountries. The rarest countries<br />\nworked are nations in the South<br />\nPacific and throughout Africa.<br />\nSeveral official countries have<br />\nfewer than ten licensed<br />\noperators. For those small<br />\nislands and out-of-the-way<br />\nplaces with no operators, a<br />\ngroup of hams will occassionally go on a \"DX-pedition\" for<br />\na weekend to offer hams<br />\nworldwide the opportunity to<br />\nsnag a rare one.<br />\nFor those hams interested in<br />\nrelaying messages, \"nets\" are<br />\norganized to help them and to<br />\nmake the system more reliable<br />\nA net is simply an organized<br />\ngroup of amateurs operating on<br />\nthe air. Usually there is one<br />\noperator who directs the operation of the net. Besides message<br />\nhandling, nets are organized for<br />\nhams with outside common interests, such as photography or<br />\nflying, or for talking about interest within ham radio, such as<br />\nsatellite communications or<br />\ncomputers.<br />\nFor the technically inclined,<br />\nthe hobby offers a broad array<br />\nof possibilities.

The technical scope<br />\nof the hobby is impressive but<br />\nit should not deter the beginner.<br />\nBesides being expensive, these<br />\nvarious feats take considerable<br /><br />\nTrudy Karr<br /><br />\nexperience.

Anti-viral drugs are administered and the effects are<br />\nmonitored continuously until<br />\nthere is sound evidence the infection is controlled and the<br />\nthreat of swelling is gone.<br />\nOther viral diseases, brain<br />\ntumors, hemorrhages, and a<br />\ncondition in which fluid fails to<br />\ndrain from the brain, also result<br />\nin swelling and are approached<br />\nin much the same way.<br /><br />\nFor some other conditions,<br />\nNCCU physicians and nurses<br />\nmay use drugs and anesthetics<br />\nto slow metabolism and reduce<br />\nthe brain's energy requirements. This is often<br />\nnecessary to speed reduction of<br />\nswelling and the healing<br />\nprocess.<br />\nThe NCCU excpects to treat<br />\nsome 800 patients a year in the<br />\nnew unit. Currently, 400 patients a year are seen in the old,<br />\nfour-bed unit.<br />\nAmong the other conditions<br />\ntreated in the NCCU is<br />\nGuillain-Barre syndrome, a<br />\nparalyzing disorder usually triggered by a severe reaction to a<br />\nviral illness. In GBS, antibodies<br />\nthat are part of the patient's immune defense system attack the<br />\nfiber sheath that insulates nerve<br />\ncells. This usually leads to a<br />\ncomplete paralysis of the<br />\nmuscles involved in activities<br />\nsuch as breathing, swallowing,<br />\nand talking.<br />\nSuccessful treatment of GBS,<br />\ndeveloped at Hopkins, removes<br />\nthe attacking antibodies from<br />\nthe blood.

Its specialists have<br />\nnew<br />\nseveral<br />\nevaluated<br />\ntreatments suggested by<br />\nresearch here and elsewhere.<br /><br />\nScientists at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions<br />\nhave become the first to chart<br />\nthe distribution of opiate receptors in the living human brain.<br />\nThe receptors are chemical sites<br />\nwhich mediate the body's<br />\nnatural pain-killing response to<br />\nphysical and emotional stress as<br />\nwell as influencing euphoric<br />\nmood changes.<br />\nThe research, presented<br />\nMarch 14 during a national<br />\nconference on brain receptor<br />\nimaging at Hopkins, may have<br />\nbroad applications in the<br />\ndiagnosis and treatment of<br />\ndepression, schizophrenia, narcotics addition, Parkinson's<br />\ndisease, chronic pain, and other<br />\ndisorders.<br />\n\"Now that we can measure<br />\nopiate receptor distribution in<br />\nliving people, we can perform<br />\nstudies many times during a<br />\nperson's illness. Prior to this<br />\nadvance it was possible to<br />\nmeasure receptors only in postmortem brain tissue,\" said<br />\nJames J. Frost, M.D., Ph.D.,<br />\nprofessor a of<br />\nassistant<br />\nradiology.<br />\nDr. Frost led the 12-person<br />\nteam of scientists that achieved<br />\nthe first opiate receptor image<br />\nwith a positron emission<br />\ntomography (PET)scanner on<br />\nMay 25, 1984. His report,<br />\npublished in the March Journal<br />\nAssisted<br />\nof<br />\nComputer<br />\nTomography, describes the<br />\nevent and the methods used to<br />\naccomplish it.<br />\nOne of the research scientists<br />\nhimself, Henry N. Wagner, Jr.,<br /><br />\nM.D., was the first person to be<br />\ninjected with a new radioactive<br />\ndrug that binds to opiate receptor sites. This drug emits a tiny<br />\namount of radioactivity\u2014not<br />\nenough to harm Dr. Wagner,<br />\nbut just enough to be detected<br />\nby the PET scanner. The scanner, in turn, measures the concentration of radioactivity in a<br />\npredetermined \"slice\" of the<br />\nbrain, and depicts it as a receptor map on a computer screen.<br />\nThe brain, Dr. Frost explains, is composed largely of<br />\ncells called neurons. These consist of the cell body\u2014the main<br />\npart of the cell\u2014and long<br />\nthreadlike projections called axons. Axons serve as the brain's<br />\nwiring. An electrical impulse<br />\ntravels down the axon and ends<br />\nat the knob, a tiny bulbous<br />\nprotuberance.<br />\nThis electric impulse releases<br />\nchemicals that cross the gap<br />\nbetween brain cells. These<br />\nchemicals, called neurotransmitters, come to rest in<br />\nspecial slots, or receptors, on<br />\nneighboring brain cells. The<br />\nneurotransmitter fits into the<br />\nreceptor in much the same way<br />\na key fits into a lock. In turn,<br />\nthis triggers an electrical impulse in the receiving brain cell,<br />\nthus beginning the process<br />\nanew. In this way, neurons<br />\ncommunicate with each other.<br />\nDifferent kinds of neurotransmitters fit into different<br />\nkinds of receptors, Dr. Frost<br />\nadds, and each appears to be involved in a different brain funcare<br />\nEnkephalins<br />\ntion.<br /><br />\nneurotransmitters that fit into<br />\nthe opiate receptor sites and,<br />\naside from alleviating pain, also<br />\nappear to depress breathing and<br />\npromote sleep in much the same<br />\nway as drugs such as morphine.<br />\nThe enkephalins, in turn, are<br />\ndivided into several subtypes,<br />\neach of which has its own corresponding receptor.

The liver enlarges when<br />\nblood is trapped. Blood fluids<br />\nthen seep into the abdominal<br />\narea.<br />\nThe fluid, up to 25 quarts,<br />\nimmobilizes patients and, if untreated, results in liver failure<br /><br />\nand death within two years,<br />\nsays Dr. Cameron, who is also<br />\ndirector of the Department of<br />\nGeneral Surgery.<br />\nFirst used in 1978, the shunt<br />\nwas developed by Dr. Cameron<br />\nand his colleagues and has been<br />\ninserted in more patients at<br />\nHopkins than any other<br />\nhospital. The procedure has<br />\nbeen performned 11 times in<br />\nnine patients with Budd-Chiari,<br />\nwhich occurs more often in<br />\nwomen. Nine of the patients<br />\nwere female.<br />\nThe procedure was repeated<br />\nin two patients because the<br />\nshunt became clogged in one<br />\npatient and collapsed in<br />\nanother.<br />\nAlthough uncommon, BuddChiari may be increasing due to<br />\nthe widespread use of estrogen<br />\nbirth control pills.

Having roommates<br />\nof such diverse backgrounds<br />\ncan be a lot of fun, especially<br />\nwhen comedies arise from the<br />\nmisunderstandings due to<br />\ncultural clashes.<br />\nI, being the average<br />\nAmerican female, tacked up<br />\nsome pictures of male models<br />\non the bulletin board. The pictures were from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune's Sunday<br />\nmagazine and featured the sensual backs of models from<br />\nDayton's department store.<br />\nThe article was titled, \"The<br />\nBeefcake Industry\". Neither<br />\none of my roommates knew the<br />\nterm. I explained: \"You know,<br />\na hunk.\" My roommate from<br />\nBaltimore, Stephanie, caught<br />\non right away, but Jeanne,<br />\nfrom Hong Kong, continued to<br />\nstare at me blankly.<br />\nThis happens often in our<br />\napartment, particularly concerning men. I don't claim to<br />\nknow everything about men,<br />\nbut I grew up with an older<br />\nbrother and some guys ask me<br />\nout from time to time.<br />\nStephanie and Jeanne leave it<br />\nup to me to talk about men<br />\nbecause I amuse them with my<br />\nstories. I come home from a<br />\nfrat party and the first thing<br />\nthey want to know is who ap-<br /><br />\nproached me and what he looked like. You should have seen<br />\nJeanne's eyes widen when I told<br />\nher about the guy I'd never seen<br />\nbefore who stopped in front of<br />\nme, ran his hand through my<br />\nhair, and then introduced<br />\nhimself. The American male is<br />\na species apart, with or without<br />\nwords.<br />\nMen aren't the only thing in<br />\nthe world to talk and laugh<br />\nabout. Sometimes, language<br />\nitself provides us a source of<br />\nI<br />\nspeak<br />\namusement.<br />\nMidwestern English and constantly use slang words.<br />\nStephanie and I understand<br />\neach other, even though some<br />\nof our terms don't coincide.<br />\nFor instance, she says \"soda,\"<br />\nI say \"pop\"; she says \"pocketbook,\" I say \"purse,\" etc. We<br />\nrarely misunderstand each<br />\nother because we know how to<br />\nother's<br />\neach<br />\ntranslate<br />\n\"Americanese\".<br />\nBut Jeanne doesn't know the<br />\nins and outs of \"Americanese\".<br />\nShe's always the victim of my<br />\nslang talk. Yesterday, the three<br />\nof us sat in the living room<br />\ndiscussing sleep habits. I asked<br />\nif she had ever had a crick in<br />\nher neck. As soon as I said the<br />\nword, I knew I was in trouble.<br />\nJeanne's blank stare greeted<br />\nme. Luckily, Stephanie helped<br />\nout and described crick without<br />\nusing slang.<br />\nSpeaking of explanations,<br /><br />\nwhen I tried to define \"hunk\"<br />\nfor Jeanne, she thought I said<br />\n\"hulk,\" bringing to mind a picture of Bill Bixby. Then she<br />\nthought I said \"chunk.\" I guess<br />\nthat's logical when you tie it<br />\ntogether with beefcake.<br />\nLaughing, I said, \"No, we<br />\ndon't call them 'chunks,'<br />\nalthough a man can be chunky,<br />\nmeaning he's overweight.\"<br />\nOf course, misunderstandings can work the other way<br />\ntoo. Jeanne asked me how my<br />\n\"year\" was now. My spoonful<br />\nof Grape Nuts stopped midway<br />\nto my mouth. Why did she ask<br />\nme that question? It was only<br />\nthe end of January, not long<br />\nenough to determine what 1986<br />\nwould be like yet. Besides,<br />\nthat's not the kind of question<br />\nyou ask during breakfast. She<br />\nrepeated her question, this time<br />\npointing to her ear. I wondered<br />\nif she had an earache. Suddenly, it dawned on me.\"Oh, you<br />\nmean my ear.\" She nodded,<br />\nwondering what else I could<br />\nhave been thinking. I said, \"I<br />\nthought you said 'year' instead<br />\nof 'ear'.\" We both started<br />\nlaughing. It took her about ten<br />\nrepetitions before she could say<br />\n\"ear\" without a y-sound. Now,<br />\nshe carefully pronounces \"ear\"<br />\nand \"year.\"<br />\nI've really enjoyed living with<br />\nmy roommates from Baltimore<br />\nand Hong Kong.

I am referring to the<br />\nclause that explicitly states that<br />\n\"Life begins at the moment of<br />\nthe pick-up line.\"<br />\nI will leave the ethical and<br />\nbiological implications of this<br />\ndefinition to more qualified<br />\nobservers, such as Lewis<br />\nThomas or<br />\nDr. Ruth<br />\nWestheimer (who, with her<br />\nusual gift for pointed wit,<br />\nremarked this past Sunday on<br />\nher syndicated radio show:<br />\n\"Those cwasy Wight to Wifers,<br />\nhe he he!\") I would like,<br />\nhowever, to discuss the effects<br />\nof this legislation of the Johns<br />\nHopkins social life.<br />\nHopkins differs academically from other colleges across the<br />\nnation, and it differs socially<br />\nfor the same basic reasons. Unfortunately, there is a marked<br />\ntendency among the Administration, and even among<br />\nthe students themselves, to<br />\ndown-play this aspect of the<br />\nschool\u2014\"Hey, if you wanted a<br />\nfour-year party, you should<br />\nhave gone to----(fill in the name<br />\nof an Ivy League school that rejected you).\" As Steve Muller<br />\nput it in his orientation<br />\nstatistical analysis, \"I'm glad<br />\nyour SATs are the highest in<br />\nour history, because you are<br />\ncertainly the ugliest class in a<br />\nlong while... You are attending<br />\na cutting-edge, research institution, and you are the leaders of<br />\ntomorrow. So I don't think it's<br />\nasking too much of you to invent a social life.\"<br />\nBut this social aspect of college should not be undervalued.<br /><br />\nFor four years, we are insulated<br />\nfrom many of the pressures of<br />\nthe outside world, with a<br />\nmultitude of students who<br />\nshare many of our interests and<br />\naspirations: there are few situations after graduation that will<br />\neven remotely stack up in opportunities to meet lovers<br />\nand/or spouses. In a nutshell,<br />\nan important function of most<br />\ncolleges is to serve as a breeding<br />\nground.<br />\nThere is not much breeding<br />\ngoing on at Hopkins. Intense<br />\nacademic pressure and angst<br />\nover future careers combine to<br />\nconvince many of use that we<br />\nsimply don't have time for an<br />\nintense relationship. \"The lady<br />\nor the tiger\" becomes \"the lady<br />\nor the term paper.\"<br />\nOne unfortunate consequence is that Hopkins men,<br />\ndespite the laudable efforts of<br />\nthe Feminist Alliance, feel they<br />\nsimply don't have the time to<br />\nconsider women as more than<br />\nsex objects. In the Levering<br />\ncafeteria last week, I overheard<br />\none Hopkins man excitedly<br />\npostulate that the ideal Hopkins<br />\nwoman \"doesn't want any<br />\ncommitment, is on the pill, is<br />\nincredible in bed, and at two<br />\no'clock turns into a pizza.\"<br />\nWhere breeding is concerned,<br />\nthe pick-up line is as far as<br />\nmany of us get.

This year Chairman Jeff<br />\nRothfeld will award a 19-inch<br />\ncolor TV to the official student<br />\ngroup which raises the most<br />\nmoney for the cause.<br /><br />\nSo, you think dancing for 24<br />\nhours is tough? Think about<br />\nthe long hours you've spent<br />\nwith one textbook! Like last<br />\nyear, professional and student<br />\nDJs will spin a variety of dance<br />\ntunes at varying speeds to help<br />\nthe 24 hours rush by. At JHU's<br />\npremier dance event, dressing<br />\nfor comfort is key, but chic<br />\nshould not be forgotten. Flat<br />\nshoes are a good bet, when<br />\npaired with loose-fitting cottons; say a teeshirt and flashy<br /><br />\nboxers or a miniskirt. People<br />\nwill definitely be looking at<br />\nyou.<br />\nAnother asset to this year's<br />\nDance-a-thon is open registration. Students from Goucher<br />\nand Notre Dame are being actively recruited, so don't worry<br />\nabout having only your lab<br />\npartner to dance with. In addition, TV cameras may focus on<br />\nyou like they did in 1984. Last<br />\nyear's dancers even made<br />\nGames- ma(!azine!<br /><br />\nThe Dance-a-thon will run<br />\nfrom 9 p.m. on Friday, April<br />\n12, through 9 p.m. Saturday<br />\nthe 13th. Rothfeld suggests<br />\nsigning up before Spring<br />\nBreak\u2014all the cool people do<br />\nthis, plus vacation is the best<br />\ntime to hit friends, relatives,<br />\nand good looking strangers up<br />\nfor the cash pledges you must<br />\ncollect.

Few<br />\nwill find or, in fact, seek positions that are in any way related<br />\nto their career goals. Upon<br />\ngraduation most of these<br />\nstudents will have very little, if<br />\nany, job experience in their<br />\nchosen fields.<br />\nAlthough the economy has<br />\nbeen improving and the<br />\nunemployment rate has been<br />\ndeclining, job prospects for college graduates are bleak. Look<br />\nat the classified ads and see how<br />\nmany positions are listed that<br />\ndo not require experience. Very<br />\nfew. The job market is improving for experienced professionals and for the skilled blue<br />\nworker. But for the recent college graduate, it's<br />\nanother story. Can the college<br /><br />\nstudent prepare himself for a<br />\nbetter crack at the job market?<br />\nYes. Those students who have<br />\ngained work experience in their<br />\nchosen fields prior to graduation will have an edge on the<br />\njob market.<br />\nThe career internship is a way<br />\nof gaining the \"Experience<br />\nNecessary\" so that upon<br />\ngraduation the resume will<br />\nreflect not only course work in<br />\nthe chose field, but practical,<br />\nhands-on work experience.<br />\nWe at the National Career<br />\nInternship service suggest that<br />\nnow is the time to address this<br />\nissue.<br />\nInformation describing Summer Internship Placements can<br />\nbe obtained by writing or calling the National Career Internship service at 374 New York<br />\nAvenue, Huntington, New<br />\nYork (516) 673-0440.<br /><br />\n000000000000000000000000000000<br /><br />\n01<br /><br />\nFRESHMEN!

A Broadway musical<br />\nclassic, West Side Story<br />\nreplaces the Capulets and the<br />\nMontagues with the Jets and<br />\nthe Sharks, and retells the story<br />\nof Romeo and Juliet in the<br />\nviolent streets of New York<br />\nCity.<br />\nThis production is completely student produced and is quite<br />\ngood overall. Faced with a<br />\nseries of complications and setbacks, including conflicts with<br />\nthe original hired director, the<br />\ncast managed to pull themselves<br />\nthrough and capture the spirit<br />\nof the play: violent, tender, farcical, and mournful at various<br />\npoints.<br />\nStudent directors Mary<br />\nDonofrio, Matthew Gertzog<br />\nand Jim Sullivan were eventually responsible for putting the<br />\nshow together. Assisting them<br />\nwas choreographer Anton<br />\nMack. The choreography was<br />\nrather strong throughout,<br />\nespecially so in the numbers<br />\n\"Gee, Officer Krupke,\"<br />\n\"Dance at the Gym,\" and in<br />\nthe fateful rumble at the end of<br /><br />\nAct I.<br />\nAlso strong was the orchestra, conducted by freshman<br />\nSteve Gayler, which, after a<br />\nrocky start, came together and<br />\nset the tone. The music accompanying the fight scenes was<br />\nparticularly effective as the<br />\npiano clashed with trumpet<br />\nblasts while the Jets and Sharks<br />\nwere locking horns onstage.<br />\nHowever, during the second<br />\nnumber, \"The Jet Song,\" the<br />\nband seemed to be playing one<br />\nsong, and the Jets singing<br />\nanother; the actors had trouble<br />\nsinging in unison, and could<br />\nbarely be heard over the music.<br />\nFollowing this scene, which occurs at the beginning of Act I,<br />\nthis reporter thought he was in<br />\nfor a long night.<br />\nThese fears were put to rest<br />\nwith the appearance of the<br />\nRomeo-like Tony (Brian Doyle)<br />\nwhose rendition of the solo<br />\n\"Something's Coming\" came<br />\nnear to literally bringing down<br />\nthe house.(More accurately, it<br />\nwas the backdrop that fell.) Indeed, Doyle's portrayal of<br />\nTony was one of several excellent performances.<br />\nJim Sullivan, who plays Riff,<br />\nthe Jets' leader, was absent for<br />\nthe show on which this review<br />\nis based. Jim Sullivan is a virtual synonym for Hopkins thespianism, and the talent and ex-<br /><br />\nperience that he could have lent<br />\nto the character of Riff were<br />\nundoubtedly missed. Filling in<br />\nfor him was understudy Dale<br />\nBell who performed very commendably although he did not<br />\nquite sing loudly enough. For<br />\nthe other performances Bell<br />\nplays Jet member In/Out.<br />\nWhile the whole cast was<br />\nsolid, there are several whose<br />\nperformances deserve special<br />\nrecognition. Laurence Milgram<br />\nwas excellent as Action, a<br />\nmember of the Jets. Following<br />\nRiff's death, he becomes the de<br />\nfacto leader of the gang,<br />\nleading the Jets in a terrifically<br />\nspirited rendition of \"Gee, Officer Krupke.\"<br />\nThe Sharks had their terrifically spirited number as<br />\nwell. Theirs is \"America\"<br />\nwhich spells out the Sharks'<br />\npredicament of being a minority discriminated against (Puerto Ricans)in what is supposedly a land of opportunity.<br />\nHighlighting this number was<br />\nTara Allmen as Anita, the<br />\ngirlfriend of the leader of the<br />\nSharks. Allmen, in the second<br />\nfemale lead, sang and acted<br />\nwith feeling and believability in<br />\nboth acts.<br />\nThe indisputable star of the<br />\nshow, however, was Amy<br />\nFrances Reiter playing Maria,<br />\nTony's Puerto Rican girlfriend.<br /><br />\nBlade Runner at the BMA<br />\nby Steve Brett<br />\nBlade Runner will be playing<br />\ntonight at the Film Forum of<br />\nthe Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nAs part of their \"Close-Up\"<br />\nseries, the screening will be<br />\nfollowed by a discussion of the<br />\nwork from a psychoanalytic<br />\npoint of view by a qualified<br />\nmedical doctor. Not bad, considering the poor reviews the<br />\nfilm received upon its initial<br />\nrelease.<br />\nIn the wake of his latest hit,<br />\nWitness, a recent issue of Time<br />\nmagazine described Blade Runner's Harrison Ford as being<br />\nvirtual box office gold:\". .. he<br />\nhas not only got it, but got it<br />\nbig enough to draw lines that<br />\nstretch around the block and into the next galaxy.\" Of course,<br />\nwho else but Ford could make<br />\nthe claim of starring in five of<br />\nthe highest grossing movies of<br />\nall time? Witness itself is quite<br />\na success as well: it was the<br />\nnumber two movie in the<br />\nBaltimore area last week, second only to Beverly Hills Cop,<br />\nand it is faring similarly well nationwide. But it may not be Mr.<br />\nFord that gets the long lines as<br />\nit is Mr. Solo of Star Wars or<br />\nDr. Jones of Raiders of the<br />\nLost Ark. Ford's name attached to such films as Force Ten<br />\nFrom Navaronne or Hanover<br />\nStreet provided no guarantee of<br />\nsuccess for these critical and<br />\nbox office failures.<br />\nBlade Runner, like the many<br />\nother Ford also-rans, received<br />\ntepid reviews and performed<br />\ncorrespondingly at the box of-<br /><br />\nfice upon its original release in<br />\n1982. But, since its first appearance, Blade Runner continues to be shown time and<br />\nagain in theaters such as New<br />\nYork City's revival houses, and<br />\nit has been Thursday's midnight movie in Greenwich<br />\nVillage's St. Marks Place<br />\nCinema for over two years.<br />\nWhat are people currently<br />\nreading into Blade Runner that<br />\nits original critics failed to see?<br />\nActually, an easier question<br />\nto start with may be, \"What's<br />\nthe difference between science<br />\nfiction such as Star Wars or<br />\nStar Trek or 2001: A Space<br />\nOdyssey or Blade Runner?\"<br />\nWithout a doubt, the differences abound, but one difference is obvious from the<br />\nstart: time. Star Wars and Star<br />\nTrek may take place in totally<br />\ndifferent periods (a long time<br />\nago and the 23rd century,<br />\nrespectively), but what they do<br />\nshare is the fact that a viewer of<br />\ntoday will be unable to attest to<br />\nthe truth of the visions they present. It will always be possible<br />\nthat a Star Wars-like saga, or<br />\neven the technology necessary<br />\nfor one, occurred or existed \"a<br />\nlong time ago in a galaxy far,<br />\nfar away;\" there is no way to<br />\nknow for sure. Similarly, unless<br />\ncryogenics sees significant advancement in the near future, it<br />\nis doubtful that any contemporary viewer will live to see<br />\nwhether there will be<br />\ntransporters, phasers, warp<br />\ndrive, and Klingons as in Gene<br />\nRoddenberry's 23rd century.<br />\nBut, of course, this is all fiction<br />\nmeant for entertainment, not<br /><br />\nintended to be actual predictions of the future (or, in the<br />\ncase of the Star Wars films,<br />\nhistory lessons).<br />\nThe near-future films, such<br />\nas 2001 or Blade Runner(which<br />\ntakes place in 2019) are different. Stanley Kubrick and<br />\nRidley Scott, directors of 2001<br />\nand Blade Runner, respectively, must have both realized that<br />\na significant portion of viewers<br />\nwould live to see whether or not<br />\nthese pictures of the near-future<br />\nwould be accurate. Neither film<br />\npresents a particularly flattering<br />\nimage, but these two images are<br />\nquite distinct. And it is the view<br />\npresented in Blade Runner<br />\nwhich, even if exaggerated,<br />\nlooks like it may be closer to the<br />\ngeneral direction in which city<br />\nlife is heading.<br />\nThe Los Angeles of 2019 is<br />\nfilthy, wet, smoggy, and<br />\ndisgusting. Thanks to the<br />\ntechnology made available by<br />\n2019, the clutter of advertising<br />\nis virtually inescapable in this<br />\nmuggy, claustrophobic city.<br />\nThe immense billboards fly,<br />\ntalk, sing, annoy; they are<br />\nalmost constantly seen or<br />\nheard, and when they are not,<br />\nthey at least seem to be. The<br />\nsenses are constantly assaulted,<br />\nand Ridley Scott, who also<br />\ndirected Alien, executes this atmosphere so perfectly that even<br />\nin a cool, roomy theater, a<br />\nviewer just might find him or<br />\nherself feeling hot, sweaty,<br />\novercrowded, and tense.<br />\nThe biggest building in this<br />\nL.A. houses the Tyrell Corporation, a mega-conglomerate<br />\nContinued on Page 20<br /><br />\nWith her powerful voice and as<br />\nmany solos as she had, she<br />\ncould have stolen the show.

Despite its short<br />\nlife, the art deco movement left<br />\nits mark not only in furniture<br />\nand glass, but also in fashion<br />\nand architecture (think Chrysler<br />\nbuilding).<br />\nThe exhibit at the BMA,<br />\nhowever, focuses primarily on<br />\nfurniture and glass. The works<br />\nof five of the best known art<br />\ndeco cabinet makers are<br />\nfeatured, with emphasis on<br />\npieces by Emile-Jacques<br />\nRuhlmann, probably the most<br />\nfamous of all the French<br />\ncabinet makers at that time.<br />\nRuhlmann is known for his<br />\n\"elegance of line,\" which is apparent in such a variety of<br /><br />\npieces as his box-like cabinets<br />\nperching on four dainty,<br />\ntoothpick-like legs, to his<br />\nbathtub of a bed, with matching night table and chairs. In<br />\nsome pieces, elements of<br />\nclassicism are apparent, while<br />\nthe bigger pieces suggest<br />\nstreamlined industrialism, complete with ultra-shiny lacquered<br />\nfinish. These aspects are also<br />\nvisible in pieces by other artists,<br />\nsuch as the wood desk with the<br />\none large, cylindrical chrome<br />\nleg.<br />\nA variety of glass vases is<br />\nalso included in the exhibition.<br />\nThe vases tend towards big and<br />\nthick, with decorations molded<br />\ninto or painted onto them.<br />\nThese designs range from ancient Egyptian motifs, to colorful geometric designs that bring<br />\nthe Cubist movement to mind.<br />\nSome of the jewelry and<br />\ncigarette cases in one corner of<br />\nthe exhibition are also worth<br />\ntaking a look at. Especially in<br />\nthe compacts are the geometric<br />\npatterns of the art deco movement so obvious.<br />\nThe art deco exhibit will be<br />\nin the Thalheimer galleries of<br />\nthe BMA through April. It offers a concise glimpse into this<br />\ncurrently fashionable movement.

Led by senior<br />\ntri-captain Larry Quinn, the<br />\nsquad shut down Syracuse alleverything Tim Nelson and<br />\nquieted the usually explosive<br />\nOrange offense. With this<br />\nbehind them, freshman Mike<br />\nMorrill broke a fourth quarter<br />\ntie and sophomore Jack<br />\nCrawford scored the insurance<br />\ngoal to bring the Jays their first<br />\nvictory of the season.<br />\nHopkins versus Syracuse.<br />\nAlready a tremendous rivalry,<br />\nthis game had it all: offensive<br />\nfirepower; aggressive, swarming defense; hard hitting all-out<br />\nplay; outstanding individual efforts; and the inevitable sharp<br />\nswings of momentum. The<br />\nmost highly-awaited game of<br />\nthe season, it was a virtual<br />\nrematch of the squads which<br />\nhad met nearly ten months<br /><br />\nLarry Volz<br /><br />\nBrian Wood scores his second goal of the game past Syracuse goalie Tom Nims.<br /><br />\nbefore at the 1984 NCAA<br />\nChampionsip Game in Newark,<br />\nDelaware.<br />\nIn many ways, the match-up<br />\nfulfilled the expectations of the<br />\nnearly 8,200 fans who packed<br />\nthe Conrad Geblein stands and<br />\nalmost all of the available stan-<br /><br />\nding room. While neither<br />\nHopkins nor Syracuse were as<br />\npolished as they had been dur<br />\ning the title game, both team<br />\ndisplayed the talent and abilit<br />\nwhich earned them the numbe<br />\none and two preseason rank<br />\nings, respectively.<br /><br />\nFreshman Mike Morrill scored his first goal as a Blue Jay Saturday, the game winner.<br /><br />\nLarry Volz<br /><br />\nThe Jays set the tempo for<br />\nthe first quarter as senior Greg<br />\nMatthews won the opening<br />\nfaceoff from Syracuse's Brad<br />\nKotz. Setting up for the score,<br />\nHopkins found the Orangeman<br />\ndefense to be quite effective. As<br />\nattackman Brian Wood drove<br />\nto the net, he was quickly stripped of the ball by defenseman<br />\nSheehan.<br />\nThe<br />\nKevin<br />\nOrangemen immediately looked for the fast break and tried<br />\nto push the ball upfield. Their<br />\nattack was unable to handle a<br />\nhigh pass, however, and<br />\nHopkins regained control.<br />\nThe next two trips downfield<br />\nproved equally fruitless for the<br />\nJays, as Sheehan appeared to<br />\nhave Wood's number, easily<br />\nstick-checking him and causing<br />\nthe turnover. Syracuse, though,<br />\nwas also unable to connect on<br />\nits clearing passes and its offense never had control of the<br />\nball.<br />\nActually, the Orange starting<br />\nten appeared to be more<br />\nunsettled than unprepared to<br />\nplay. \"Anytime you play on<br />\nHomewood Field for the first<br />\ntime you're going to be nervous,\" commented Matthews.<br />\nAfter nearly four scoreless<br />\nminutes, the Blue Jays finally<br />\nfound an opening. Syracuse, in<br />\nan attempt to regain control of<br />\nthe game, brought in six long<br />\nsticks to ride Hopkins' clear.<br />\nThe move backfired, however,<br />\nas the Jays quickly cleared the<br />\nball, finding Wood alone on the<br />\nfly. Streaking by three<br />\ndefenders, Wood cut in front of<br /><br />\nthe net and deposited the first<br />\ngoal of the game past a helpless<br />\nTom Nims.<br />\nFifty seconds later, Wood<br />\nstruck again, scooping up a<br />\nmishandled clearing pass and<br />\nbreaking in alone on Nims for<br />\nhis second unassisted goal.<br />\nBy now, the Syracuse defense<br />\nwas obviously pressing. Playing<br />\nexceedingly cautious and often<br />\ndropping the ball, the<br />\nOrangemen were having trouble breaking through the tough<br />\nBlue Jay ride. Without their<br />\nbread-and-butter transition<br />\ngame, Syracuse was also unable<br />\nto mount an effective offensive<br />\nthreat.<br />\nLess than two minutes would<br />\npass before another unsuccessful clear would prove costly. This time it was midfielder<br />\nDel Dressel, who stripped a<br />\nSyracuse defender as he received an outlet pass from Nims.<br />\nThe ball then quickly found<br />\nitself on the stick of sophomore<br />\nattackman Craig Bubier. Taking a step towards the crease,<br />\nBubier immediately spotted<br />\nWood cutting in front of the<br />\ngoal. A second later the score<br />\nwas 3-0.<br />\nDominating at midfield, the<br />\nJays were able to contain the<br />\nSyracuse transition game while<br />\nmaintaining constant pressure<br />\non the Orange goal. \"We were<br />\nrelentless,\" said defensive middie Brad McLam, \"We made<br />\nthem work for the ball and kept<br />\nthem in a half-field game.\"<br />\nContinued on Pare 24<br /><br />\n.

The game was originally<br />\nscheduled to be at Notre Dame,<br />\nbut a last minute switch<br />\nbrought the contest to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBrill and McFarland were the<br />\nkey offensive players for the<br />\nJays, as each tallied three goals.<br />\nAll three of McFarland's scores<br />\ncame in the second half with the<br />\ngame on the line. Brill scored<br />\nonly one goal, the Jays' eighth,<br />\nafter intermission, and that<br /><br />\nNotre Dame struck out to a 4-2<br />\nadvantage. The Jays re<br />\ngrouped, though, and by halftime they had gained the<br />\nmomentum and pulled to<br />\nwithin one, at 5-4. Brill had two<br />\ngoals during the period, while<br />\nfreshman Heather Klink and<br />\njunior transfer Eileen Janec<br />\nadded one each.<br />\nIn the second half, the Jays<br />\nbegan to control the ball, and<br />\nthey managed to parlay this advantage into goals. Freshman<br />\nJennifer Stahl got things going<br />\nearly on as she put one in to tie<br />\nthe game at 5. The Gators<br />\nresponded quickly with a score<br />\nthat put them up 6-5, but the<br />\nJays responded with three<br />\nstraight, a streak that gave them<br />\na lead that they would not relinquish. McFarland tallied twice<br /><br />\nOpening day jitters<br /><br />\n\"We have a lot of new people, and we were a little worried<br />\nabout everyone fitting in and<br />\nworking together,\" said cocaptain Shelly Davis.\"We were<br />\nreally pleased. Everyone hustled, and we put it together for<br />\nthe win.\"<br />\nThe Jay defense was<br />\nsomewhat shaky at the start,<br />\nbut but it settled down in the second half as the women allowed only two goals. Mary Yun<br />\nhad a fine game in the nets, turning away 16 of 23 shots.<br />\nEarly on, it looked as if<br />\nHopkins was in for a long afternoon. The skies were gray, the<br />\ntemperature was falling, and<br /><br />\nin a row, followed by Brill, who<br />\ntook a faceoff and fired her<br />\nthird goal to put the Jays up by<br />\ntwo.<br />\n\"It was a garbage goal,\" said<br />\nBrill. \"The shot was at the<br />\ngoalie's feet, and I just picked<br />\nit up and plopped it in.\"<br />\nNotre Dame put one more<br />\npast Yun to pull to 8-7, but then<br />\nKlink scored what appeared by<br />\nthe clincher as time ran out.<br />\nThe freshman picked up a<br />\nloose ball at midfield, raced<br />\ndownfield, and shot it squarely into the Notre Dame net. The<br />\nGators protested the goal,<br />\nhowever, claiming that Klink<br />\nhad used an illegal stick. Before<br />\nshe let the referee see the stick,<br />\nKlink tugged on the strings, not<br />\nknowing that this was illegal<br />\nduring such a procedure.

Quinn had come out trouble.<br />\nOnce again, however, it was<br />\nof the net to stuff a Printup<br />\nshot, but was unable to scoop Wood to the rescue.

The difference this time was Syracuse's<br />\ninability to shake the tough<br />\nBlue Jay man-to-man defensive<br />\npressure. With defenseman<br />\nJohn DeTommaso denying Tim<br />\nNelson the opportunity to drive<br />\nor feed to the crease, the<br />\nSyracuse \"spaghetti\" offense<br />\nwas nearly completely shut<br />\ndown.<br />\n\"The first time [Tim] Nelson<br />\nwent to the goal, there were<br />\nover ten minutes gone,\" said<br />\ngoalie Quinn. \"We were concerned with Nelson's feeding,<br />\nbut we worked harder than we<br />\never have for the first three<br />\nweeks.

Not surprisingly, it<br />\nwas Tim Nelson providing the<br />\nspark as he fed Printup and<br />\nsophomore Gordon Mapes for<br />\ncrease-area scores to give the<br />\nOrangemen the tie at five goals<br />\napiece.<br />\nThe Blue Jays refused to<br />\nabandon ship and reclaimed the<br />\nlead as Bubier scored on a solo<br />\ndrive to the Orange goal. Three<br />\nminutes later Syracuse again<br />\ntied the score as junior midfielder Eric Jeschke put home<br />\nan unassisted goal. With only<br />\nseven minutes to play, the game<br />\nwas up for grabs.<br />\nHaving the Homewood<br />\ncrowd behind them, the Jays<br />\ndug deep for that little extra<br />\nwhich would pull them<br />\nthrough. They found it with<br />\nless than four minutes to play.<br />\nQuickly working the ball<br />\naround the perimeter, Del<br />\nDressel soon spotted attackman<br />\nMike Morrill perched in front<br />\nof the Syracuse crease. Receiving a perfect pass, Morrill then<br />\nfought off two Orange<br />\ndefenders and deposited the<br />\ngame winner past Nims.<br />\nOne minute later the Jays<br />\nwould seal their victory as<br />\nsophomore midfielder Jack<br />\nCrawford made another one of<br />\nhis usually outstanding efforts.<br />\nAs Nims lunged for the rebound of a wood crank shot,<br />\nCrawford dove and slid along<br />\nthe turf, just managing to poke<br />\nit past him.<br />\nAs time quickly drifted away,<br />\nSyracuse would attempt, in<br />\nvain, to score again. Once the<br />\nBlue Jays regained possession,<br />\nthough, they were content to<br />\npass the ball around and not try<br />\nto score. In fact, the Jays had<br />\nseveral prime opportunities for<br />\na ninth goal, but continued to<br />\nfrustrate Syracuse with a \"keep<br />\naway\" offense, much to the<br />\ndelight of Hopkins' fans.<br />\n\"We've been working hard,\"<br />\nsaid Zimmerman. \"It was a real<br />\ndogfight, but we were able to<br />\nreach back and bring it out.<br />\nThe defense won the game for<br />\nus.\" Zimmerman awarded<br />\ngameballs to Morrill, Pallace,<br />\nDeTommaso, and Quinn.<br /><br />\nLarry Volz<br /><br />\n\"Everyone played so well,\"<br />\ncommented DeTommaso.\"We<br />\ngot the four goals early and we<br />\nfelt more confident.
