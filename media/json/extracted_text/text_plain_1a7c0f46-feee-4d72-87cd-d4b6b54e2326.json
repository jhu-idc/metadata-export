This development has many interesting possibilities.<br />\nIt may or may not tie up with the recent protest<br />\nof the student body against athletic conditions at the<br />\nUniversity, which protest was put into the hands of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees last month and immediate action upon which is desired by all parties concerned.<br />\nWithout wishing to detract one whit from the good<br />\nintentions of the Board, we confidently assert that<br />\nits attention would never have been directed to the<br />\nmatter, had it not been for the tireless and unflinching<br />\nefforts of Norman Heaney and his associates in<br />\nframing the protest and in pushing it to such an extent<br />\nthat the Board was compelled to take cognizance of<br />\nits moment.<br />\nThis is by no means a'ssuming a \"We did it, fellows\" attitude, just because the NEWS-LETTER happened to be the cannon through which most of the<br />\nthunderous bombardment was carried on. Indeed,<br />\nthe action of the Athletic Association in sending out<br />\n\"feelers\" may be prompted by quite different motives.<br />\nYet the indisputable fact remains that student interest when properly crystallized and organized, as was<br />\nthe case in this instance, can be employed as an<br />\neffective weapon of protest.<br />\nDefinite announcement of the Board's decision as<br />\nto the entire situation will not be long forthcoming.<br />\nRegardless of the specific details of this decision,<br />\nhowever, the undergraduate body can take full pride<br />\nin the realization that it did its share of the work by<br />\nattentive attendance at the \"open forum\" assemblies<br />\nand by other such manifestations of wholehearted<br />\nsupport. Once the natural leaders had displayed<br />\nthemselves, the rest of the army followed behind<br />\nresolutely and in step.<br />\n<br />\nQuite Coincidental<br />\nWhile searching for a text which would permit<br />\nus to put aside our seemingly inherent faculty for<br />\ncriticism and substitute in its stead an atmosphere of<br />\nblitheness, we came upon the subject of coincidences.<br />\nBearing the dictionary interpretation of \"two things<br />\noccurring at the same time,\" these phenomena have<br />\nalways proved a source of painful interest to us ever<br />\nsince that yesterday when we ate four green apples<br />\nat one tree-climbing and then had the doctor come to<br />\nour house for four consecutive days. We're still<br />\nseeking the significance of this coincidence, especially<br />\nin view of the fact that \"an apple a day keeps the<br />\ndoctor away.\" (Now that you have caught us in a<br />\nblithesome mood, perhaps you appreciate our serious<br />\nside all the more.)<br />\nThe Hopkins has its full portion of coincidences.<br />\nFor instance, consider the following which come<br />\nquickly to mind, together with their logical explanations:<br />\nDr. David M.

This development has many interesting possibilities.<br />\nIt may or may not tie up with the recent protest<br />\nof the student body against athletic conditions at the<br />\nUniversity, which protest was put into the hands of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees last month and immediate action upon which is desired by all parties concerned.<br />\nWithout wishing to detract one whit from the good<br />\nintentions of the Board, we confidently assert that<br />\nits attention would never have been directed to the<br />\nmatter, had it not been for the tireless and unflinching<br />\nefforts of Norman Heaney and his associates in<br />\nframing the protest and in pushing it to such an extent<br />\nthat the Board was compelled to take cognizance of<br />\nits moment.<br />\nThis is by no means a'ssuming a \"We did it, fellows\" attitude, just because the NEWS-LETTER happened to be the cannon through which most of the<br />\nthunderous bombardment was carried on. Indeed,<br />\nthe action of the Athletic Association in sending out<br />\n\"feelers\" may be prompted by quite different motives.<br />\nYet the indisputable fact remains that student interest when properly crystallized and organized, as was<br />\nthe case in this instance, can be employed as an<br />\neffective weapon of protest.<br />\nDefinite announcement of the Board's decision as<br />\nto the entire situation will not be long forthcoming.<br />\nRegardless of the specific details of this decision,<br />\nhowever, the undergraduate body can take full pride<br />\nin the realization that it did its share of the work by<br />\nattentive attendance at the \"open forum\" assemblies<br />\nand by other such manifestations of wholehearted<br />\nsupport. Once the natural leaders had displayed<br />\nthemselves, the rest of the army followed behind<br />\nresolutely and in step.<br /><br />\nQuite Coincidental<br />\nWhile searching for a text which would permit<br />\nus to put aside our seemingly inherent faculty for<br />\ncriticism and substitute in its stead an atmosphere of<br />\nblitheness, we came upon the subject of coincidences.<br />\nBearing the dictionary interpretation of \"two things<br />\noccurring at the same time,\" these phenomena have<br />\nalways proved a source of painful interest to us ever<br />\nsince that yesterday when we ate four green apples<br />\nat one tree-climbing and then had the doctor come to<br />\nour house for four consecutive days. We're still<br />\nseeking the significance of this coincidence, especially<br />\nin view of the fact that \"an apple a day keeps the<br />\ndoctor away.\" (Now that you have caught us in a<br />\nblithesome mood, perhaps you appreciate our serious<br />\nside all the more.)<br />\nThe Hopkins has its full portion of coincidences.<br />\nFor instance, consider the following which come<br />\nquickly to mind, together with their logical explanations:<br />\nDr. David M. Robinson and party reached Greece<br />\nthe very day that Samuel Insull attempted his unsuccessful disappearing act. Comment\u2014Insull, no doubt,<br />\nrealized he couldn't hide anywhere in Greece with any<br />\ndegree of safety when the good doctor inaugurated<br />\nhis digging exercises.<br />\nAll of the less fertile minds apparently congregated in one of the three Elements of Economics sections, judging from the fact that a total of one (1)<br />\nHonor was duly granted to a class consisting of approximately seventy-five students. Comment\u2014And<br />\nwe thought that Christmas was a long way off!<br />\nWhen the NEWS-LETTER recently condemned the<br />\nAthletic Association for an obvious lack of proper<br />\nequipment, the latter group remembered that it had<br />\njust Ordered some new uniforms. Comment\u2014Those<br />\nboys certainly can keep a secret!<br />\nFeminine members of the College for Teachers<br />\nhave been observed of late reading cinema magazines<br />\nrather than their scholarly texts. Comment\u2014Doubtless the photographers of the city papers have put<br />\nideas into their heads. Is there no way of discouraging them? Just think of our poor children in the<br />\npublic schools learning that Mae West is a national<br />\nfigure and Greta Garbo a Swedish ambassador of<br />\ngood-will!<br />\nWhen you read this, we'll be at Temple University attending the I.
