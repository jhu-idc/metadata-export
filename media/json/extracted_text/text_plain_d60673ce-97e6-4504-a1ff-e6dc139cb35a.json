We have no intention of<br />\nindulging in a long discussion of the value or drawbacks of the<br />\nannual riots, or of delving into the bloody annals of past years<br />\n\u2022 a history of the famous spring sport.<br />\nin order to present<br />\nFrom the determined and confident way in which the<br />\nFreshmen have ,begun their campaign, they do not seem to<br />\nneed any information as to what the objects of the game are<br />\nor how they are obtained. All that is left for us is to offer a<br />\nlittle advice. We counsel moderation.<br />\nThe only way in which the Freshmen can learn about the<br />\nthe fine points of the banquet season is from the stories of those<br />\nwho have gone before them and on account of the unfortunate<br />\nlimifations of human nature, these stories cannot always be<br />\nstrictly depended upon. The achievements of the past always<br />\nlook bigger than they really were. For instance a senior, recounting the exploits of his youth to a group of admiring<br />\nlisteners may distinctly remember the time he killed three<br />\nsophomores, when as a matter of fact he only maimed one<br />\n(and a rather small one at that). If his memory has become a<br />\nlittle blurred in the -course of three years it is not his fault<br />\nand besides no one else -can remember- well enough- to -cheek alp \u2022<br />\non him. The season, then is not quite the brutual affair that<br />\nall the stories beginning \"I rem' ember the time when ...\" would<br />\nlead one to believe.<br />\nWe would not have anybody believe that we are trying to<br />\nbelittle the banquet season, or to deny that it is the greatest<br />\nfun in the world, or that it should be entered into whole-heartedly There are only two things that it will be well to bear in<br />\nmind. In t* he first place, the good name of the University<br />\nshould be considered. On account of the location of the campus,<br />\na great part of the warfare *ill be waged in the city. Whenever<br />\nit is not in direct conflict with the vital issues of the campaign,<br />\nencounters in the streets, which might lead some of the uninitiated citizens to believe that Hopkins students are a gang of<br />\nthugs, should be avoided.<br />\nThe second thing to remember is that after all the whole<br />\nbanquet season is only a game after all. In the heat of battle<br />\nit is easy for a man to forget this, and to do something he will<br />\nbe sorry for afterward. Slugging and grudge fights are against<br />\nthe spirit of the thing, and have always been barred.<br />\n1 hat's all there is to it. May the best class win.

We have no intention of<br />\nindulging in a long discussion of the value or drawbacks of the<br />\nannual riots, or of delving into the bloody annals of past years<br />\n\u2022 a history of the famous spring sport.<br />\nin order to present<br />\nFrom the determined and confident way in which the<br />\nFreshmen have ,begun their campaign, they do not seem to<br />\nneed any information as to what the objects of the game are<br />\nor how they are obtained. All that is left for us is to offer a<br />\nlittle advice. We counsel moderation.<br />\nThe only way in which the Freshmen can learn about the<br />\nthe fine points of the banquet season is from the stories of those<br />\nwho have gone before them and on account of the unfortunate<br />\nlimifations of human nature, these stories cannot always be<br />\nstrictly depended upon. The achievements of the past always<br />\nlook bigger than they really were. For instance a senior, recounting the exploits of his youth to a group of admiring<br />\nlisteners may distinctly remember the time he killed three<br />\nsophomores, when as a matter of fact he only maimed one<br />\n(and a rather small one at that). If his memory has become a<br />\nlittle blurred in the -course of three years it is not his fault<br />\nand besides no one else -can remember- well enough- to -cheek alp \u2022<br />\non him. The season, then is not quite the brutual affair that<br />\nall the stories beginning \"I rem' ember the time when ...\" would<br />\nlead one to believe.<br />\nWe would not have anybody believe that we are trying to<br />\nbelittle the banquet season, or to deny that it is the greatest<br />\nfun in the world, or that it should be entered into whole-heartedly There are only two things that it will be well to bear in<br />\nmind. In t* he first place, the good name of the University<br />\nshould be considered. On account of the location of the campus,<br />\na great part of the warfare *ill be waged in the city. Whenever<br />\nit is not in direct conflict with the vital issues of the campaign,<br />\nencounters in the streets, which might lead some of the uninitiated citizens to believe that Hopkins students are a gang of<br />\nthugs, should be avoided.<br />\nThe second thing to remember is that after all the whole<br />\nbanquet season is only a game after all. In the heat of battle<br />\nit is easy for a man to forget this, and to do something he will<br />\nbe sorry for afterward. Slugging and grudge fights are against<br />\nthe spirit of the thing, and have always been barred.<br />\n1 hat's all there is to it. May the best class win.
