It's contagious. I don't see how anyone<br />\ncould not be interested in Art<br />\nHistory.\"<br />\nAs an associate professor of<br />\nHistory of Art, Dr. Phoebe Stanton<br />\nhas shared her enthusiasm for the<br />\nsubject with many Hopkins students<br />\nover the last decade. Her lectures in<br />\nShaffer 3 draw a consistent crowd of<br />\nstudents, many of them science<br />\nmajors and pre-meds.<br />\nSitting in her University Parkway<br />\napartment, Dr. Stanton talked<br />\nabout her own art collection.<br />\n\"Some people look at art as an<br />\ninvestment. I don't. All of this may<br />\nbe burned after I'm gone, but as long<br />\nas I'm here, I get a great deal of<br />\npleasure out of it.\"<br />\nHer tastes, like her opinions, are<br />\neclectic. A beautiful, huge, abstract<br />\ncanvas, a plaster sculpture done by<br />\nher son-a student at Antioch, a<br />\ncomplex, dreamlike architect's<br />\ndrawing, and an op-artish design are<br />\namong the artworks hanging on the<br />\nwalls.<br />\n\"I believe in a free-form, organic,<br />\ninstinctive way of life.\" She contrasted this with the lifestyles of<br />\nboth the \"establishment\" and<br />\ntoday's youth.<br />\nShe views youth as attempting to<br />\nescape from a convention-bound<br />\nsociety, only to entrap themselves<br />\n<br />\nphoto by peter caloger<br />\n<br />\n\"I've been a<br />\npacifist<br />\nall my life.\"<br />\nwith rules of their own design.<br />\n\"They make terrible demands of<br />\nthemselves. They still have a conception of duty, of how they ought to<br />\nact.Speaking of the \"generation gap<br />\nDr. Stanton remarked, \"The difference between my generation and<br />\nyours is that you can disappear into<br />\na peer group, with similar con-<br />\n<br />\nvictions and dress.\"<br />\nShe believes that this has already<br />\nplayed a major role in reshaping the<br />\ncountry. \"In the last ten years more<br />\nchange has taken place in American<br />\nlife than took place in the rest of my<br />\nlifetime. Youth has had a lot to do<br />\nwith it.\"<br />\nCurled in her chair, Dr. Stanton<br />\noften seemed strangely remote,<br />\nthough her answers were clearly<br />\nhonest and candid. Pausing infrequently, she expressed all her<br />\nopinions with conviction.<br />\nShe has strong feelings on the<br />\ndecay of America's cities, especially<br />\nBaltimore. Speaking earlier in the<br />\nday to a Levering Hall audience, she<br />\nmourned the erosion of Baltimore's<br />\narchitectural character.<br />\nTo prevent the demolition of what<br />\nremains of Baltimore's beauty, and<br />\nespecially, to preserve the city's<br />\nsalient architectural feature-the row<br />\nhouse-she called upon city dwellers<br />\nto raise their voices as taxpayers.<br />\n\"There ought to be a kind of<br />\nConsumers Report on city planning. If people don't get assertive<br />\nabout their tastes, our cities will be<br />\nnothing but sprawling developments<br />\nalongside highways.\"<br />\n\"We have no gift for city living,\"<br />\nshe concluded, \"unlike the<br />\nEuropeans.\" Dr. Stanton visits<br />\nEurope often, both for her research<br />\nand for pleasure. She recently<br />\nreturned from the Soviet Union.<br />\n\"Moscow and Leningrad were<br />\n<br />\nfascinating from the architectural<br />\nstandpoint,\" she commented.<br />\nDr. Stanton's original field was<br />\n19th Century diplomatic history. She<br />\nhad almost completed her doctorate<br />\nwhen WW II broke out and she went<br />\nto work for the government.<br />\nAfter the war she switched fields<br />\nand went to London to study 19th<br />\nCentury Architecture under the well<br />\nknown art historian Nicolaus<br />\nPevsner.<br />\nReturning to the U.S., she taught<br />\nat Bryn Mawr, then jointly at<br />\nHopkins and Goucher before being<br />\nappointed to the Hopkins faculty in<br />\n1962.<br />\nDr. Stanton grew up in Lebanon,<br />\nher father's native land.

Although the committee was not charged to<br />\nconsider it, trust was the premise on which the panel<br />\nbased its findings. It is the premise underlying all effective governmental systems. It is lacking at Hopkins.<br />\nBut premises, though harder to construct than<br />\narguments, can be built. The governance report does not<br />\nmake an attempt. The charge of the committee<br />\nprohibited it.<br />\nThe ASRC could be a step in the right direction but as<br />\nit is presently constituted it falls short. What the<br />\ngovernance committee is telling students, in effect, is:<br />\nBe satisfied with the ASRC, and let the faculty keep its<br />\nprerogatives. As long as the Academic Council exists in<br />\ntandem with the ASRC, the community's respect for the<br />\nASRC's decision-making authority will suffer.<br />\nIf the faculty is interested in cementing a base of<br />\ntrust, it must take the first step (no one else can), invest<br />\nthe Academic Council's authority in a body in which<br />\nstudent's have a say, and open up departmental<br />\ngovernance matters to students.<br />\n<br />\nHonest Answer<br />\nIt seems a shame that Hopkins is losing not only its<br />\nEducation Department but its Master of Arts in<br />\nTeaching program. Faculty, students and administrators are unanimous in their favorable appraisal<br />\nof the program's worth. The problem, as Dean Benton<br />\nsaid, is money.<br />\nThose involved with the program have charged that<br />\nresources are available to maintain it on a reduced<br />\nlevel. They believe the program is being phased out<br />\nbecause it is too \"non-academic\" for Hopkins-- the same<br />\nargument given by members of the Social Relations<br />\ndepartment in refusing to approve Dr. Wickwire's urban<br />\ninvolvement courses.<br />\nThe charges need an honest answer.<br />\n<br />\n\"Simply Silly\"<br />\n<br />\nSexism<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour October 2 editorial \"APL's Present\"<br />\nbuilds its unfair accusations on a mythical<br />\nfoundation.<br />\nOn various occasions last year, including<br />\nan open meeting in Shriver 'Hall and<br />\nnumerous conversations with faculty and<br />\nstudent groups, I described all aspects of the<br />\nUniversity's relations with APL.<br />\nOn the financial side, I pointed out that<br />\nwhen the Trustees decided to maintain the<br />\nconnection with APL after World War II,<br />\nthey proposed the principle of \"no gain, no<br />\nloss\" to the University in order to protect the<br />\nUniversity's autonomy. I explained that the<br />\n$60,000 annual administrative fee is a<br />\nminimal calculation of central University<br />\nadministrative overhead costs attributable<br />\nto APL.<br />\nI then described the reasons for the<br />\ncreation of the APL Stabilization Fund in the<br />\nlate 1950's, the limitations on its use, and the<br />\nfact that income from its investment is<br />\nallocated to the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nI also said that this income of about<br />\n$250,000 per year, while not insignificant,<br />\nshould not be the decisive factor in determining University policy on relations with<br />\nAPL. I also described the arrangements<br />\ncontained in the so-called Termination<br />\nAgreement.<br />\nOn Friday evening, Dr. William Bevan<br />\nstated to me by telephone that he had<br />\nlikewise given full explanations on these<br />\npoints in his discussions with student and<br />\nfaculty groups.<br />\nIt may be that News-Letter personnel were<br />\nnot present on those occasions or failed to<br />\nunderstand the rather complex history and<br />\nstatus of the Stabilization Fund. But there<br />\nwas never any secret about it or attempt to<br />\nconceal it.<br />\nYour accusation of \"masking true motives<br />\nin intellectual arguments\" is simply silly.<br />\nNothing would have been easier than to say<br />\nthat the so-called intellectual and moral<br />\narguments don't matter because we can't<br />\nafford to lose the money anyway.<br />\nIn fact, the positions I took on both these<br />\nissues last spring are what I believe on the<br />\nintellectual and moral merits.

In your article on the elimination of independent study in the English dept., Dr.<br />\nMiller mentions that there is only one course<br />\non Shakespeare (6.310?) for grad students<br />\nhere, whereas at Berkeley four or five<br />\nShakespeare courses a year are open to<br />\ngad students. Dr. Miller does not qualify<br />\nhis statement however, by mentioning two<br />\nthings: 1) U.C. Berkeley is on the \"quarter,<br />\n\"<br />\nor trimester system, i.e., a \"quarto.<br />\ncourse is worth, both time and credit-wise,<br />\nonly two-thirds of a semester course, and<br />\nthus half again as many credits are needed for<br />\nany particular degree 180 units are needed<br />\nfor a B.A. at Berkeley, as opposed to 120<br />\ncredits here ; 2) the Berkeley campus of the<br />\nUniversity of California has ten times as<br />\nmany students as the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHomewood Campus, so naturally more<br />\ncourses would be offered. Also, to my<br />\nknowledge, the proportion of \"English\" grad<br />\nstudents to the student body as a whole is<br />\ngreater at Berkeley than here.<br />\nAn ex-Berkeley resident,<br />\nWales Nematollahi<br />\nOutright Discrimination<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to call attention to several<br />\ninconsistencies in the Governance Report.<br />\nThe first concerns membership on the<br />\nUnproposed Representative Council.<br />\ndergraduate members of the Student Council<br />\nand graduate members of the GS0<br />\nExecutive Board are excluded from<br />\nmembership on the ASRC.

Although the<br />\nJays were forced to give the<br />\nball back toF and M, the team<br />\nagain found themselves on<br />\nthe F and M 10 a few minutes<br />\nlater, due to fine defense<br />\nand an excellent punt runback.<br />\nAgain faced with a fourth<br />\ndown situation, the Jays tried<br />\nto catch F and M off guard by<br />\n\"faking the field goals.\"<br />\nThe play didn't work,<br />\nhowever, and the Jays still<br />\ntrailed by the score of 6-0.<br />\nEarly in the second<br />\nquarter, after intercepting a<br />\npass, Hopkins ran the ball<br />\nback to the F and M 7. A few<br />\nseconds later, Jim Pitts hit<br />\nBill Donovan for a 6-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass. The Jays<br />\n<br />\nmissed the two points conversion, though, and still<br />\ntrailed 6-7.<br />\nThe only other scoring of<br />\nthis half came when Craig<br />\nMarks kicked a 21 yard field<br />\ngoal, giving FM a 6-10 lead at<br />\nhalf time.<br />\nThe second half of the<br />\nballgame was completely<br />\ndominated by Hopkins. The<br />\ndefense, which had played a<br />\ngood first half, was completely impenetrable in the<br />\nsecond.<br />\nBob Pfeiffer started at<br />\nquarterback in the second<br />\nhalf and was able to move the<br />\nball very well.

It's contagious. I don't see how anyone<br />\ncould not be interested in Art<br />\nHistory.\"<br />\nAs an associate professor of<br />\nHistory of Art, Dr. Phoebe Stanton<br />\nhas shared her enthusiasm for the<br />\nsubject with many Hopkins students<br />\nover the last decade. Her lectures in<br />\nShaffer 3 draw a consistent crowd of<br />\nstudents, many of them science<br />\nmajors and pre-meds.<br />\nSitting in her University Parkway<br />\napartment, Dr. Stanton talked<br />\nabout her own art collection.<br />\n\"Some people look at art as an<br />\ninvestment. I don't. All of this may<br />\nbe burned after I'm gone, but as long<br />\nas I'm here, I get a great deal of<br />\npleasure out of it.\"<br />\nHer tastes, like her opinions, are<br />\neclectic. A beautiful, huge, abstract<br />\ncanvas, a plaster sculpture done by<br />\nher son-a student at Antioch, a<br />\ncomplex, dreamlike architect's<br />\ndrawing, and an op-artish design are<br />\namong the artworks hanging on the<br />\nwalls.<br />\n\"I believe in a free-form, organic,<br />\ninstinctive way of life.\" She contrasted this with the lifestyles of<br />\nboth the \"establishment\" and<br />\ntoday's youth.<br />\nShe views youth as attempting to<br />\nescape from a convention-bound<br />\nsociety, only to entrap themselves<br /><br />\nphoto by peter caloger<br /><br />\n\"I've been a<br />\npacifist<br />\nall my life.\"<br />\nwith rules of their own design.<br />\n\"They make terrible demands of<br />\nthemselves. They still have a conception of duty, of how they ought to<br />\nact.Speaking of the \"generation gap<br />\nDr. Stanton remarked, \"The difference between my generation and<br />\nyours is that you can disappear into<br />\na peer group, with similar con-<br /><br />\nvictions and dress.\"<br />\nShe believes that this has already<br />\nplayed a major role in reshaping the<br />\ncountry. \"In the last ten years more<br />\nchange has taken place in American<br />\nlife than took place in the rest of my<br />\nlifetime. Youth has had a lot to do<br />\nwith it.\"<br />\nCurled in her chair, Dr. Stanton<br />\noften seemed strangely remote,<br />\nthough her answers were clearly<br />\nhonest and candid. Pausing infrequently, she expressed all her<br />\nopinions with conviction.<br />\nShe has strong feelings on the<br />\ndecay of America's cities, especially<br />\nBaltimore. Speaking earlier in the<br />\nday to a Levering Hall audience, she<br />\nmourned the erosion of Baltimore's<br />\narchitectural character.<br />\nTo prevent the demolition of what<br />\nremains of Baltimore's beauty, and<br />\nespecially, to preserve the city's<br />\nsalient architectural feature-the row<br />\nhouse-she called upon city dwellers<br />\nto raise their voices as taxpayers.<br />\n\"There ought to be a kind of<br />\nConsumers Report on city planning. If people don't get assertive<br />\nabout their tastes, our cities will be<br />\nnothing but sprawling developments<br />\nalongside highways.\"<br />\n\"We have no gift for city living,\"<br />\nshe concluded, \"unlike the<br />\nEuropeans.\" Dr. Stanton visits<br />\nEurope often, both for her research<br />\nand for pleasure. She recently<br />\nreturned from the Soviet Union.<br />\n\"Moscow and Leningrad were<br /><br />\nfascinating from the architectural<br />\nstandpoint,\" she commented.<br />\nDr. Stanton's original field was<br />\n19th Century diplomatic history. She<br />\nhad almost completed her doctorate<br />\nwhen WW II broke out and she went<br />\nto work for the government.<br />\nAfter the war she switched fields<br />\nand went to London to study 19th<br />\nCentury Architecture under the well<br />\nknown art historian Nicolaus<br />\nPevsner.<br />\nReturning to the U.S., she taught<br />\nat Bryn Mawr, then jointly at<br />\nHopkins and Goucher before being<br />\nappointed to the Hopkins faculty in<br />\n1962.<br />\nDr. Stanton grew up in Lebanon,<br />\nher father's native land. She still<br />\nmakes occasional visits there, and<br />\nspeaks warmly of the traditional<br />\nArab hospitality.<br />\n\"A deeper understanding of Arab<br />\nculture is essential if there's ever<br />\ngoing to be peace in the Middle<br />\nEast,\" she said. \"It's a pity no one<br />\nlistened to the refugees until they<br />\nblew up 50 million dollars worth of<br />\nplanes.\"<br />\n\"I've been a pacifist all my life. I<br />\ndon't believe that anything good can<br />\nbe achieved through violence.'<br />\nAs the interview was ending, Dr.<br />\nStanton expressed surprise that she<br />\nhadn't been asked about Women's<br />\nLib.\"I'm glad you didn't,\" she said.<br />\n\"I think it's a very boring subject.\"<br />\nPerhaps Phoebe Stanton has been<br />\nthere and gone.<br /><br />\nThe Barber Business: Razor-Thin Profits<br />\nIn the quiet of the Levering<br />\nHall<br />\nbarbershop.

Although the committee was not charged to<br />\nconsider it, trust was the premise on which the panel<br />\nbased its findings. It is the premise underlying all effective governmental systems. It is lacking at Hopkins.<br />\nBut premises, though harder to construct than<br />\narguments, can be built. The governance report does not<br />\nmake an attempt. The charge of the committee<br />\nprohibited it.<br />\nThe ASRC could be a step in the right direction but as<br />\nit is presently constituted it falls short. What the<br />\ngovernance committee is telling students, in effect, is:<br />\nBe satisfied with the ASRC, and let the faculty keep its<br />\nprerogatives. As long as the Academic Council exists in<br />\ntandem with the ASRC, the community's respect for the<br />\nASRC's decision-making authority will suffer.<br />\nIf the faculty is interested in cementing a base of<br />\ntrust, it must take the first step (no one else can), invest<br />\nthe Academic Council's authority in a body in which<br />\nstudent's have a say, and open up departmental<br />\ngovernance matters to students.<br /><br />\nHonest Answer<br />\nIt seems a shame that Hopkins is losing not only its<br />\nEducation Department but its Master of Arts in<br />\nTeaching program. Faculty, students and administrators are unanimous in their favorable appraisal<br />\nof the program's worth. The problem, as Dean Benton<br />\nsaid, is money.<br />\nThose involved with the program have charged that<br />\nresources are available to maintain it on a reduced<br />\nlevel. They believe the program is being phased out<br />\nbecause it is too \"non-academic\" for Hopkins-- the same<br />\nargument given by members of the Social Relations<br />\ndepartment in refusing to approve Dr. Wickwire's urban<br />\ninvolvement courses.<br />\nThe charges need an honest answer.<br /><br />\n\"Simply Silly\"<br /><br />\nSexism<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour October 2 editorial \"APL's Present\"<br />\nbuilds its unfair accusations on a mythical<br />\nfoundation.<br />\nOn various occasions last year, including<br />\nan open meeting in Shriver 'Hall and<br />\nnumerous conversations with faculty and<br />\nstudent groups, I described all aspects of the<br />\nUniversity's relations with APL.<br />\nOn the financial side, I pointed out that<br />\nwhen the Trustees decided to maintain the<br />\nconnection with APL after World War II,<br />\nthey proposed the principle of \"no gain, no<br />\nloss\" to the University in order to protect the<br />\nUniversity's autonomy. I explained that the<br />\n$60,000 annual administrative fee is a<br />\nminimal calculation of central University<br />\nadministrative overhead costs attributable<br />\nto APL.<br />\nI then described the reasons for the<br />\ncreation of the APL Stabilization Fund in the<br />\nlate 1950's, the limitations on its use, and the<br />\nfact that income from its investment is<br />\nallocated to the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nI also said that this income of about<br />\n$250,000 per year, while not insignificant,<br />\nshould not be the decisive factor in determining University policy on relations with<br />\nAPL. I also described the arrangements<br />\ncontained in the so-called Termination<br />\nAgreement.<br />\nOn Friday evening, Dr. William Bevan<br />\nstated to me by telephone that he had<br />\nlikewise given full explanations on these<br />\npoints in his discussions with student and<br />\nfaculty groups.<br />\nIt may be that News-Letter personnel were<br />\nnot present on those occasions or failed to<br />\nunderstand the rather complex history and<br />\nstatus of the Stabilization Fund. But there<br />\nwas never any secret about it or attempt to<br />\nconceal it.<br />\nYour accusation of \"masking true motives<br />\nin intellectual arguments\" is simply silly.<br />\nNothing would have been easier than to say<br />\nthat the so-called intellectual and moral<br />\narguments don't matter because we can't<br />\nafford to lose the money anyway.<br />\nIn fact, the positions I took on both these<br />\nissues last spring are what I believe on the<br />\nintellectual and moral merits. The fact that<br />\nfinancial considerations may weigh on the<br />\nsame side does not detract from those<br />\nmerits.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nhave always thought that truth in advertising was some sort of ideal.<br />\nI am not amused to see a halfclothed<br />\n\"chick\" simpering under the macho gaze of<br />\na naked-torsoed \"stud '!<br />\nYour torso \"may be even more so\" but by<br />\nprinting such bullshit sexist ads, you are<br />\nand<br />\nperpetrating<br />\noppression<br />\nthe<br />\ndehumanization of women. We are not<br />\nobjects.<br />\nCarol Benson<br />\nMiller Rebutted<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n. In your article on the elimination of independent study in the English dept., Dr.<br />\nMiller mentions that there is only one course<br />\non Shakespeare (6.310?) for grad students<br />\nhere, whereas at Berkeley four or five<br />\nShakespeare courses a year are open to<br />\ngad students. Dr. Miller does not qualify<br />\nhis statement however, by mentioning two<br />\nthings: 1) U.C. Berkeley is on the \"quarter,<br />\n\"<br />\nor trimester system, i.e., a \"quarto.<br />\ncourse is worth, both time and credit-wise,<br />\nonly two-thirds of a semester course, and<br />\nthus half again as many credits are needed for<br />\nany particular degree 180 units are needed<br />\nfor a B.A. at Berkeley, as opposed to 120<br />\ncredits here ; 2) the Berkeley campus of the<br />\nUniversity of California has ten times as<br />\nmany students as the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHomewood Campus, so naturally more<br />\ncourses would be offered.

Although the<br />\nJays were forced to give the<br />\nball back toF and M, the team<br />\nagain found themselves on<br />\nthe F and M 10 a few minutes<br />\nlater, due to fine defense<br />\nand an excellent punt runback.<br />\nAgain faced with a fourth<br />\ndown situation, the Jays tried<br />\nto catch F and M off guard by<br />\n\"faking the field goals.\"<br />\nThe play didn't work,<br />\nhowever, and the Jays still<br />\ntrailed by the score of 6-0.<br />\nEarly in the second<br />\nquarter, after intercepting a<br />\npass, Hopkins ran the ball<br />\nback to the F and M 7. A few<br />\nseconds later, Jim Pitts hit<br />\nBill Donovan for a 6-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass. The Jays<br /><br />\nmissed the two points conversion, though, and still<br />\ntrailed 6-7.<br />\nThe only other scoring of<br />\nthis half came when Craig<br />\nMarks kicked a 21 yard field<br />\ngoal, giving FM a 6-10 lead at<br />\nhalf time.<br />\nThe second half of the<br />\nballgame was completely<br />\ndominated by Hopkins. The<br />\ndefense, which had played a<br />\ngood first half, was completely impenetrable in the<br />\nsecond.<br />\nBob Pfeiffer started at<br />\nquarterback in the second<br />\nhalf and was able to move the<br />\nball very well. With 6:40 left<br />\nin the third period, Hopkins<br />\nscored with a 17 yard pass<br />\nfrom Pfeiffer to Tim<br />\nWeglicki with the 2 point<br />\nconversion good, Hopkins<br />\ntook a 14-10 lead.<br />\nHopkins' only other score<br />\ncame with 3:45 left in the<br />\nfourth quarter when Pat<br />\nNeary ran 5 yards for a<br />\ntouchdown after John Diorio<br />\nhad recovered a fumble on<br />\nthe FM 7.
