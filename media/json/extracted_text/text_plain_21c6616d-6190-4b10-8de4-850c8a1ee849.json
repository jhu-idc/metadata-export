Assistance from<br />\nthis latter group would greatly<br />\nhelp to solve our misunderstandings. If nothing else, I would<br />\npropose an \u2022 elected StudentFaculty Council. Properly designed and carried out, it would<br />\nraise The Hopkins to a new<br />\nheight in prestige and educational accomplishment.<br />\n<br />\nbly programs outlined elsewhere<br />\nin this paper, and the results<br />\nof the student faculty camp. The<br />\nchallenge lies in improving the<br />\nprogram by improving the student Council, both in its personnel and in its operating procedures.<br />\n<br />\ntry to displace the evident inability and lack of interest of the<br />\nCouncil to the student body at<br />\nlarge is foolish; however, the fact<br />\nremains that in electing their<br />\nrepresentatives, the students<br />\nhave, without a doubt, been influenced by the likeable \"Joe<br />\nCollege,\" the BMOC, complete<br />\nwith the tab collar and continental cut.

As a matter of fact, where has leadership<br />\ndisappeared to?<br />\nBut talking does no good.<br />\nRecall the numerous News-Letter<br />\narticles concerning attendance.<br />\nThey haven't made the slightest<br />\nimpression. What is needed, not<br />\nso much because it is a better<br />\nsystem (it would get more work<br />\ndone however), is out and out<br />\ncontrol by the administration.<br />\nAlthough we may argue that it<br />\nis undemocratic and a usurpation of the rights of the members of the community, there can<br />\nbe little hesitation in saying that<br />\nHopkins men need a few years<br />\nto cultivate responsibility toward<br />\ntheir campus.

Quite reputable statements have been carefully, and quietly, placed before the<br />\nHopkins community to the effect that several more advisors<br />\nwill take up residence in the dorms as a step towards<br />\nreturning a bit more order (and sanity) to the dorms.<br />\nIt is things like the few riots, damaged furniture and<br />\nproperty, and finally the false fire alarm that have brought<br />\nthe administration to the end of their proverbial rope.<br />\nAs any good citizen will explain to you, freedom of<br />\naction can not exist without knowledge of responsibility.<br />\nIt is all too apparent that many of the dorm students,<br />\nand their 'leaders,' have no sense of responsibility.<br />\nEven though we are students, ourselves, and even<br />\nthough we are very emphatically in favor of maintaining<br />\na definite, un-proctored, responsible dorm freedom, it is<br />\nwith very little compunction that we say that with dorm<br />\nadvisors, proctors, tighter rules, and penalties the dorm<br />\nstudent is getting everything he deserves. In fact, students should not be campused or restricted\u2014they should<br />\nbe removed from the University. A little teeth in the<br />\npenalties would go a long way.<br />\nPerhaps in a few years the pendulum will swing the<br />\nother way, and dorm students will again have the freedom<br />\nthey so loudly (and we so often) yell about.<br />\nBut this comes with responsibility.<br />\n<br />\nnot<br />\n<br />\nhere.

Aim is \"to develop the<br />\nWhole Man.\" Surely, an active<br />\nand responsible participation in<br />\nsocial and civic endeavours of<br />\nthe community is part of that<br />\ndevelopment. Hopkins has become a society of scholars devoted to study and research. We<br />\nstudents look on and endeavour<br />\nto make our place in the world<br />\nbeside these great men. This is<br />\na noble and worthwhile aim. If<br />\nIt is the whole aim of The Hop-<br />\n<br />\nDave Adams<br />\nI've been asked to comment<br />\non the effect of the poor attendance by Student Council members at meetings this year and<br />\non the mediocre record thus far<br />\ncompiled by this year's body.<br />\nAbout four scheduled meetings have lacked quorums, so<br />\nno business could be conducted<br />\nat them. At almost every meeting some one, two or three members have been absent. Obviously this poor record of attendance<br />\nhas decreased the productivity<br />\nof the Council. Those who are<br />\nabsent from a scheduled meet-<br />\n<br />\ning rob the other Council members of the opportunity to hear<br />\ntheir views on any topic under<br />\ndiscussion. If those who are<br />\nabsent number just four, the<br />\nresult is that no meeting can<br />\nbe held, no business can be<br />\nconducted, and those who have<br />\ncome have wasted their time and<br />\nare discouraged.<br />\nDiscouragement in this case,<br />\nI think, breeds lack of initiative<br />\nand interest. Very, very little<br />\nencouragement is given to any<br />\nelected representative at Johns<br />\nHopkins. No students attend<br />\nCouncil meetings, very few attend class meetings, very few<br />\noffer constructive ideas, encouragement or support to their<br />\nrepresentatives. That being the<br />\nsituation, it is ,easy for the most<br />\nto<br />\nenthusastic representative<br />\nrapidly loose his original enthusiasm and become discouraged.<br />\nEven the most promising new<br />\nclass officers usually fall into a<br />\nstate of inactivity, except for<br />\ncarrying out certain obligatory,<br />\ninescapable functions. And so<br />\nthe classes accomplish little or<br />\nnothing. The Student Council,<br />\nhowever, being a body of 17 men,<br />\nis usually able to provide itself<br />\nfrom within with the encouragement and cooperation that it<br />\ndoes not receive from without.<br />\nThis year, due in large part to<br />\nthe attendance record, I think,<br />\nthe mutual encouragement and<br />\ncooperation that have to exist<br />\namong members of the Council<br />\nhave been much less in evidence<br />\nthan in the past. One can blame<br />\nthose who have been absent most<br />\nfor any deficiencies or shortcomings of the Council, or one<br />\ncan blame the President of the<br />\nCouncil or all the members of<br />\nthe Council. But ultimately, I<br />\nthink, a large portion of the<br />\nblame must go to the student<br />\nbody.<br />\n<br />\nMcCoy Poloi<br />\nTo the editors:<br />\nIn the Johns Hopkins catalogue for undergraduates a university is described as a place<br />\nof academic freedom where a<br />\nstudent has the opportunity of<br />\nworking, searching and discovering knowledge. Unfortunately<br />\nI found that this was not the<br />\ncase when I attempted to register for a course given only in<br />\nMcCoy College. I was told that<br />\naccording to the advisory committee of McCoy there are only<br />\ntwo excuses acceptable for a day<br />\nstudent to take such a course:<br />\nEither an unavoidable conflict<br />\nmust be present of day school<br />\ncourses or the course must lie<br />\nin the fields of education and<br />\naccounting.<br />\nSince this statement is so contradictory to academic freedom,<br />\nI would suggest that the university change its wording of the<br />\nsubject in the undergraduate<br />\ncatalogue. Most important, I believe would be an attempt by the<br />\nuniversity officials to include<br />\npopular McCoy courses in the<br />\nday school.<br />\nAlan Nogen<br />\n<br />\nWe Need Men<br />\nTo the editors:<br />\nIf there's one power lacking in<br />\nyour press, it's \"man\"-power.<br />\nOne of the most admirable qualities in a man is his respect for<br />\nwoman, and it appears that this<br />\nis what you\u2014and your Hopkins<br />\nbrothers\u2014lack.<br />\n1Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 10, 1961<br />\n<br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br />\n<br />\nB& M<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nea44-edrandefrice<br />\n<br />\nDELICATESSEN AND SANDWICH SHOP<br />\n301 EAST 31ST STREET, Cor. of Guilford Ave.<br />\nJUST ONE BLOCK FROM THE FRATERNITY HOUSES<br />\nTelephone No. CH. 3-9294<br />\n<br />\nFeaturing Fine Pizza Pies<br />\nTry Our Johns Hopkins Special Submarine<br />\n<br />\nTRY OUR COMPLETE LINE OF BEER<br />\n<br />\n7'.<br />\n<br />\nOn Camps<br />\n<br />\nwith<br />\nMax ghuIman<br />\n<br />\n(Author of \"I Was a Teen-age Dwarf\",\"The Many<br />\nLoves of Dobie Gillis\", etc.)<br />\n<br />\nTHE ENGINEERS HAVE HAIRY EARS<br />\nToday in this age of technology when engineering graduates<br />\nare wooed and courted by all of America's great industries, how<br />\ndo you account for the fact that Rimbaud Sigafoos, who finished at the very top of his class at M.I.T., turned down hundreds of attractive job offers to accept employment as a machinery wiper at the Acme Ice Company at a salary of $20 a week<br />\nwith a twelve-hour day, a seven-day week, and only fifteen<br />\nminutes for lunch?<br />\nI know what you are thinking: \"Cherchez la femme!\" You are<br />\nthinking that Mr. Acme, head of the Acme Ice Company, has<br />\na beautiful daughter with whom Rimbaud is madly in love and<br />\nhe took the job only to be near her.<br />\nFriends, you are wrong. It is true that Mr. Acme does have<br />\na daughter, a large, torpid lass named Clavdia who spends all<br />\nher waking hours scooping marzipan out of a bucket and staring<br />\nat a television set which has not worked in some years. Rimbaud<br />\nhas not the slightest interest in Clavdia; nor, indeed, does any<br />\nother man, excepting possibly John Ringling North.<br />\nSo how come Rimbaud keeps working for the Acme Ice<br />\nCompany? Can it be that they provide him with free Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes, and all day long he is able to settle back, make<br />\nhimself comfortable and enjoy the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste?<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\nIs it necessary for you to<br />\ndisplay your sense of humor in<br />\nsuch a crude manner, to derive<br />\npleasure from such obnoxious<br />\nprint?

A phone call to Dean<br />\nShaffer was enough to clarify<br />\nthe unfortunate confusion. It<br />\nseems that Dean Shaffer, having told me that we had his<br />\n<br />\npermission to place the Young<br />\nSocialist in the book store \"on<br />\nthe same basis as any other<br />\nperiodical\", directed me to negotiate with a Mr. Taylor, who I<br />\nunderstand, carries the title<br />\n\"Plant Manager.\" It was Mr.<br />\nTaylor who instructed me that<br />\nhe would not permit sale of the<br />\nYoung Socialist at the book store<br />\nas it represented \"only one point<br />\nof view, while Time, Life and<br />\nUS News, presents all points of<br />\nview.\" Not being familiar with<br />\nHopkins names, titles, or responsibilities, I assumed that I had<br />\nspoken to the Bookstore Manager. Allow me to publicly<br />\napologize for having put such<br />\nfoolish words into the Bookstore<br />\nManager's mouth for which he<br />\nhas just cause for righteous<br />\nindignation. Had Mr. Taylor<br />\nchosen to speak up, he could<br />\nhave clarified the misunderstanding of titles.<br />\nIt appears, however, that Mr.<br />\nVayne, the Bookstore Manager,<br />\nhas his own reasons for not<br />\nselling the Young Socialist \"for<br />\nthe reason that his (my italics)<br />\nbook store does not handle<br />\nnewspapers.\" Now, we must enter into a discourse on the definition of a newspaper,as opposed to a magazine, \u2014 both be-<br />\n<br />\ning periodicals. My, how the<br />\nlackeys of capitalism can twist<br />\nand squirm to dig up fine technicalities in order to prevent<br />\nAmericans from reading \"unkosher\" thoughts, ideas, and information. Certainly, I can argue<br />\nthat the Young Socialist is a<br />\nmonthly magazine and Mr.<br />\nVayne can retort that it is<br />\nprinted on inexpensive newspaper print but why strain false<br />\npoints raised by evasive bureaucrats.<br />\nThe naked truth stands out for<br />\nall who have the honesty to see,<br />\nand that is that these men (and<br />\nthose whom they represent), for<br />\nsome reason which we would<br />\nall do well to investigate, do<br />\nnot want to afford Hopkins students the opportunity to read<br />\nthe Young Socialist. In order<br />\nto repair this deplorable abridgement of the right to read all<br />\nviewpoints in an academic institution, Hopkins students will<br />\nhave to buy individual subscriptions to the Young Socialist until they organize themselves in<br />\ntheir fine tradition of fighting<br />\nfor academic freedom to collectively resist this petty form of<br />\ntyranny over the minds of men.<br />\n(Continued on Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nfribe,pW &53ivedeivh`l<br />\nNo,friends, no.

Finally a kindly brakeman named Ernest Thompson<br />\nSigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud.<br />\nHe took Rimbaud home and raised him as his own, and<br />\nRimbaud, to show his appreciation, studied hard and got excellent marks and finished a distinguished academic career as<br />\nvaledictorian of M.I.T.<br />\nRimbaud never complained to his kindly foster father, but<br />\nthrough all those years of grammar school and high school and<br />\ncollege, he darn near died of the heat! A seal, you must remember, is by nature a denizen of the Arctic, so you can imagine how poor Rimbaud must have suffered in subtropical<br />\nNew York and Boston, especially in those tight Ivy League<br />\nsuits.<br />\nBut today at the Acme Ice Company, Rimbaud has finally<br />\nfound a temperature to his liking. He is very happy and sends<br />\ngreetings to his many friends.<br />\n\u00a9 1961 Max Shulman<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAny time, any clime, you get a lot to like with a Marlboro\u2014<br />\nand with Marlboro's newest partner in pleasure, the unfiltered, king-size, brand-new Philip Morris Commander.

The<br />\nfavored Dickinson men from<br />\nCarlisle, Pennsylvania are strong<br />\nright down the line. A member of the Middle Atlantic Conference, their record this year<br />\nShows only one loss against 6<br />\ntriumphs, that coming at the<br />\nhands of Temple.<br />\nFour days hence on Tuesday,<br />\nFebruary 15 the Blue Jays will<br />\ntest their wrestling skills against<br />\nthe Little Quakers of Swarthmore here at Homewood at 8:00<br />\nP.m. Last year, Swarthmore was<br />\nthe only team to see Hopkins<br />\nbow down to defeat. The Garnet<br />\nlike Dickinson belongs to toe<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference, but<br />\nunlike the men from Carlisln,<br />\nthey are especially strong in<br />\nsome spots (130, 147, 157, 167,<br />\n177) while weak in others. The<br />\nnext two matches appear to be<br />\ntwo of the toughest opponents<br />\nHopkins will meet this season.<br />\nBack on January 21, the varsity grapplers took the measure<br />\nOf Towson Teachers 31-5, while<br />\ntheir more recently scheduled<br />\ntussle against Drexel fell victim<br />\nto the same plight as that of the<br />\nfreshmen. Against Towson, Ron<br />\nDavis at 130 pounds turned in<br />\none of the most pleasant surprises of this wrestling season<br />\nSO far. He was the aggressor<br />\nall the way in gaining a draw<br />\ndecision against a much stronger<br />\nand more experienced Bill Kirby<br />\nfrom Towson.<br />\nAt present, the varsity has four<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Fencers<br />\nHost Muhlenberg<br />\nIn Conference Tilt<br />\nSaturday, February 11, the<br />\nlioPkins Fencing Team plays<br />\nhost to Muhlenburg in a Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference Match in<br />\nthe ROTC building at 2:00 p.m.<br />\nBefore the semester break, the<br />\nfreshman squad journied to<br />\nNavy, and came home in defeat;<br />\nbut not without beating Navy<br />\nin sabre, and winning 7 bouts,<br />\nthe most ever scored by a Hopkins frosh squad against Navy.<br />\nThe Navy Plebes are considered a cut or two above most collegiate varsity squads, and have<br />\nbeen practicing since last summer, while Hopkins frosh have<br />\nonly learned to fence this December. It is, therefore, no small<br />\nfeat that the sabremen defeated<br />\nNavy's sabremen, 5 to 4, the first<br />\ntime a Hopkins team has ever<br />\nbeaten Navy in any weapon.<br />\nNeither is it minor that the Jays<br />\ntook 7 bouts from Navy.<br />\nBob Carroll led the sabremen<br />\nand the rest of the team, winning all three of his bouts.

Coach Fox reports<br />\nthe squad is eagerly looking forward to their match with the<br />\nDickinson J.V. this Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 11, which should prove<br />\na real test for the frosh.<br />\n<br />\nAfter a two week layoff, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins varsity basketball<br />\nteam tangled with MIT which<br />\ndefeated them by a score of 7759. Following this, they swung<br />\ninto action against Western<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nDespite the return of Steve<br />\nEngel, Steve Cohen, and Al<br />\nLewis, the team itself unable to<br />\nget off the ground as Dave<br />\nO'Malley, Dave Sullivan, and<br />\ncompany ran over the Jays by a<br />\nscore of 90-54. This debacle<br />\nsaw the Terrors run up a score<br />\nof 10-0 before Al Lewis converted the free throw which commenced the Jays' scoring.<br />\nMidway through the second<br />\nhalf of the first quarter, with<br />\nthe Jays down by the sympathetic score of 30-7, the Western<br />\nMaryland coach removed his<br />\nstarting five, and watched his<br />\nlead \"dwindle\" to a 37-20 advantage. This, however, proved<br />\nto be less than a breather, as<br />\nthe original five returned to the<br />\ngame at the start of the next<br />\nhalf and remained there, until<br />\nthe middle of the period.<br />\nIn the second half, the Jays<br />\n<br />\nGreenberg,Sandberg<br />\nPace Frosh Cagers<br />\nBy BARDY LEVAVY<br />\nAfter travelling to Ursinus<br />\ntomorrow, the Freshman basketball team plays its last home<br />\ngame on Monday, February 13<br />\nagainst Drexel J.V.<br />\nEd Greenberg led the freshman basketball team to victories<br />\nover PMC and Western Maryland, by scores of 56-48 and<br />\n69-58, respectively, by capturing<br />\ncontrol of the boards and scoring<br />\nwell.<br />\nIn the P.M.C. game, Greenberg<br />\nwas the Baby Blue Jays' prime<br />\nmover as he captured high of<br />\n22 rebounds, as well as 10 points.<br />\nGreenberg's helper in this<br />\ngame was big Joel Sandberg.<br />\nSandberg, after an average first<br />\nhalf, connected for 13 points in<br />\nthe second half to complement<br />\nGreenberg's defensive work and<br />\ninsure the victory. Phil Berger<br />\nwith 11 and Mike Ratner with<br />\n10 were the other big scorers for<br />\nthe Jays, with Ratner's work<br />\nunder the boards being an excellent complement to Greenberg's<br />\njob there.<br />\nIn the Western Maryland<br />\ngame on February 6 at Homewood, Greenberg garnered 15 rebounds and scored 14 points in<br />\nthe first half as the Jays jumped<br />\nto a decisive 24-13 lead at the<br />\nend of 10 minutes.<br />\nSchwartz Stars<br />\nIn the second half, the frosh<br />\nproved that they were not a oneman team. Homer Schwartz,<br />\nwho finished with 10, turned in<br />\nhis finest offensive and defensive<br />\neffort of the season, and Mike<br />\nRatner and Joel Sandberg also<br />\nturned in excellent accounts of<br />\nthemselves. Sandberg scored 10<br />\npoints, when he connected for<br />\nfive of six shots. Ratner, who<br />\nfinished with 11, turned in an<br />\nexcellent offensive and defensive<br />\nperformance, capturing 14 rebounds and playing a very fine<br />\nall-around game.<br />\nPerhaps the most inspired performance of the half, however,<br />\nwas turned in by Mark Weiss.<br />\nWeiss, coming off the bench<br />\nwith 7 minutes left in the game,<br />\nquickly proceeded to garner 6<br />\nrebounds and 11 points. He also<br />\nhad the distinction of not missing a shot all evening, connectting for 3 for 3 from the floor<br />\nand 5 straight from the line.<br />\nWhile all this was going on,<br />\nGreenberg was in the process of<br />\nfinishing the game with 20<br />\n<br />\npoints and 21 rebounds, although<br />\nhe had to sit out a part because<br />\nof personal fouls.<br />\nIn the last two minutes of the<br />\ngame, Jack White, Pete Thompson and John Heller came in to<br />\nrelieve the victorious Jays. Haller scored 2 and White closed<br />\nout the game by making both<br />\nhalves of a 1 and 1 situation.<br />\nNot to be overlooked in this<br />\narray of figures is the fine work<br />\nof Phil Berger. Berger, who only<br />\nscored three points all evening,<br />\nnonetheless turned in a fine defensive effort, and played his<br />\nusual fine role as leader of the<br />\nJays' floor game.<br />\nThe game was otherwise notable for two things. The first of<br />\nthese is the fine foul shooting<br />\npercentage of the team, which<br />\nhit for 21 of 24 penalty shots.<br />\nThe other was that despite he<br />\nfine performance, the fledglings<br />\nshowed the effects of the twoweek examination layoff.<br />\n<br />\nran into more bad luck. A series<br />\nof missed \"chippies,\" bad shots,<br />\nand poor. defensive plays saw the<br />\nscore jump to 65.34 midway<br />\nthrough the period. Piling it on,<br />\nthe Terrors scored an additional<br />\n25 in the last half of the period<br />\nand completed the massacre.<br />\nThe play of the Jays was<br />\nhighlighted only by the fine rebounding of Rick Saull. The<br />\nteam, however, made up for this<br />\nat least threefold by shooting an<br />\natrocious 24.7% from the floor.<br />\nHad the teams shooting been at<br />\nall sharp, it is not inconceivable<br />\nthat they could have given the<br />\nWestminster team something of<br />\na fight.<br />\nThe addition of Engel, Lewis<br />\nand Cohne could not take its<br />\nfull effect since in return for the<br />\nservices of these three players,<br />\nwho were not in shape due to a<br />\nlong layoff, the team traded the<br />\nservices of Jaan Sulg, who was<br />\nfelled by academic deficiencies,<br />\nand Al Freeland, who sprained<br />\nhis ankle. As a result, the Jays<br />\nwere nowhere near top form for<br />\nthis game. The Jays have shown<br />\na rapid recovery from the<br />\ntrouncing in this week's practice<br />\n<br />\nsessions, however.<br />\nThe game was notable for its<br />\nlack of one thing. No matter<br />\nwhat the final result may have<br />\nbeen, in the past the Jays usually<br />\ngave their opponents a battle in<br />\nthe first half, rarely being behind<br />\nby more than a few points. Monday night, however, the team<br />\nallowed the Terrors to completely wallop them in the first half.<br />\nTo add insult to injury, the victory was the first for the Terrors<br />\nat Homewood since 1956.<br />\nImmediately after this defeat,<br />\nhowever, the Jays received some<br />\nwelcome news. Gene Edynak, a<br />\nsenior, reported out for the team.<br />\nEdynak, who had some experience a few years ago at Lafayette, is reputed to be an excellent shot, something the Jays<br />\nsorely need, especially in light of<br />\nthe shooting percentage for the<br />\nlast game and the team's crying<br />\nneed for a rebounder.<br />\nEdynak makes his varsity<br />\ndebut tomorrow at Ursinus,<br />\nwhere the Jays travel in quest<br />\nof their fourth victory in thirteen starts.

Assistance from<br />\nthis latter group would greatly<br />\nhelp to solve our misunderstandings. If nothing else, I would<br />\npropose an \u2022 elected StudentFaculty Council. Properly designed and carried out, it would<br />\nraise The Hopkins to a new<br />\nheight in prestige and educational accomplishment.<br /><br />\nbly programs outlined elsewhere<br />\nin this paper, and the results<br />\nof the student faculty camp. The<br />\nchallenge lies in improving the<br />\nprogram by improving the student Council, both in its personnel and in its operating procedures.<br /><br />\ntry to displace the evident inability and lack of interest of the<br />\nCouncil to the student body at<br />\nlarge is foolish; however, the fact<br />\nremains that in electing their<br />\nrepresentatives, the students<br />\nhave, without a doubt, been influenced by the likeable \"Joe<br />\nCollege,\" the BMOC, complete<br />\nwith the tab collar and continental cut.

What is needed, not<br />\nso much because it is a better<br />\nsystem (it would get more work<br />\ndone however), is out and out<br />\ncontrol by the administration.<br />\nAlthough we may argue that it<br />\nis undemocratic and a usurpation of the rights of the members of the community, there can<br />\nbe little hesitation in saying that<br />\nHopkins men need a few years<br />\nto cultivate responsibility toward<br />\ntheir campus.

In fact, students should not be campused or restricted\u2014they should<br />\nbe removed from the University.

Aim is \"to develop the<br />\nWhole Man.\" Surely, an active<br />\nand responsible participation in<br />\nsocial and civic endeavours of<br />\nthe community is part of that<br />\ndevelopment. Hopkins has become a society of scholars devoted to study and research. We<br />\nstudents look on and endeavour<br />\nto make our place in the world<br />\nbeside these great men. This is<br />\na noble and worthwhile aim. If<br />\nIt is the whole aim of The Hop-<br /><br />\nDave Adams<br />\nI've been asked to comment<br />\non the effect of the poor attendance by Student Council members at meetings this year and<br />\non the mediocre record thus far<br />\ncompiled by this year's body.<br />\nAbout four scheduled meetings have lacked quorums, so<br />\nno business could be conducted<br />\nat them. At almost every meeting some one, two or three members have been absent. Obviously this poor record of attendance<br />\nhas decreased the productivity<br />\nof the Council. Those who are<br />\nabsent from a scheduled meet-<br /><br />\ning rob the other Council members of the opportunity to hear<br />\ntheir views on any topic under<br />\ndiscussion. If those who are<br />\nabsent number just four, the<br />\nresult is that no meeting can<br />\nbe held, no business can be<br />\nconducted, and those who have<br />\ncome have wasted their time and<br />\nare discouraged.<br />\nDiscouragement in this case,<br />\nI think, breeds lack of initiative<br />\nand interest. Very, very little<br />\nencouragement is given to any<br />\nelected representative at Johns<br />\nHopkins. No students attend<br />\nCouncil meetings, very few attend class meetings, very few<br />\noffer constructive ideas, encouragement or support to their<br />\nrepresentatives. That being the<br />\nsituation, it is ,easy for the most<br />\nto<br />\nenthusastic representative<br />\nrapidly loose his original enthusiasm and become discouraged.<br />\nEven the most promising new<br />\nclass officers usually fall into a<br />\nstate of inactivity, except for<br />\ncarrying out certain obligatory,<br />\ninescapable functions. And so<br />\nthe classes accomplish little or<br />\nnothing. The Student Council,<br />\nhowever, being a body of 17 men,<br />\nis usually able to provide itself<br />\nfrom within with the encouragement and cooperation that it<br />\ndoes not receive from without.<br />\nThis year, due in large part to<br />\nthe attendance record, I think,<br />\nthe mutual encouragement and<br />\ncooperation that have to exist<br />\namong members of the Council<br />\nhave been much less in evidence<br />\nthan in the past. One can blame<br />\nthose who have been absent most<br />\nfor any deficiencies or shortcomings of the Council, or one<br />\ncan blame the President of the<br />\nCouncil or all the members of<br />\nthe Council. But ultimately, I<br />\nthink, a large portion of the<br />\nblame must go to the student<br />\nbody.<br /><br />\nMcCoy Poloi<br />\nTo the editors:<br />\nIn the Johns Hopkins catalogue for undergraduates a university is described as a place<br />\nof academic freedom where a<br />\nstudent has the opportunity of<br />\nworking, searching and discovering knowledge. Unfortunately<br />\nI found that this was not the<br />\ncase when I attempted to register for a course given only in<br />\nMcCoy College. I was told that<br />\naccording to the advisory committee of McCoy there are only<br />\ntwo excuses acceptable for a day<br />\nstudent to take such a course:<br />\nEither an unavoidable conflict<br />\nmust be present of day school<br />\ncourses or the course must lie<br />\nin the fields of education and<br />\naccounting.<br />\nSince this statement is so contradictory to academic freedom,<br />\nI would suggest that the university change its wording of the<br />\nsubject in the undergraduate<br />\ncatalogue.

It is true that Mr. Acme does have<br />\na daughter, a large, torpid lass named Clavdia who spends all<br />\nher waking hours scooping marzipan out of a bucket and staring<br />\nat a television set which has not worked in some years. Rimbaud<br />\nhas not the slightest interest in Clavdia; nor, indeed, does any<br />\nother man, excepting possibly John Ringling North.<br />\nSo how come Rimbaud keeps working for the Acme Ice<br />\nCompany? Can it be that they provide him with free Marlboro<br />\nCigarettes, and all day long he is able to settle back, make<br />\nhimself comfortable and enjoy the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste?<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\nIs it necessary for you to<br />\ndisplay your sense of humor in<br />\nsuch a crude manner, to derive<br />\npleasure from such obnoxious<br />\nprint?

A phone call to Dean<br />\nShaffer was enough to clarify<br />\nthe unfortunate confusion. It<br />\nseems that Dean Shaffer, having told me that we had his<br /><br />\npermission to place the Young<br />\nSocialist in the book store \"on<br />\nthe same basis as any other<br />\nperiodical\", directed me to negotiate with a Mr. Taylor, who I<br />\nunderstand, carries the title<br />\n\"Plant Manager.\" It was Mr.<br />\nTaylor who instructed me that<br />\nhe would not permit sale of the<br />\nYoung Socialist at the book store<br />\nas it represented \"only one point<br />\nof view, while Time, Life and<br />\nUS News, presents all points of<br />\nview.\" Not being familiar with<br />\nHopkins names, titles, or responsibilities, I assumed that I had<br />\nspoken to the Bookstore Manager. Allow me to publicly<br />\napologize for having put such<br />\nfoolish words into the Bookstore<br />\nManager's mouth for which he<br />\nhas just cause for righteous<br />\nindignation. Had Mr. Taylor<br />\nchosen to speak up, he could<br />\nhave clarified the misunderstanding of titles.<br />\nIt appears, however, that Mr.<br />\nVayne, the Bookstore Manager,<br />\nhas his own reasons for not<br />\nselling the Young Socialist \"for<br />\nthe reason that his (my italics)<br />\nbook store does not handle<br />\nnewspapers.\" Now, we must enter into a discourse on the definition of a newspaper,as opposed to a magazine, \u2014 both be-<br /><br />\ning periodicals. My, how the<br />\nlackeys of capitalism can twist<br />\nand squirm to dig up fine technicalities in order to prevent<br />\nAmericans from reading \"unkosher\" thoughts, ideas, and information. Certainly, I can argue<br />\nthat the Young Socialist is a<br />\nmonthly magazine and Mr.<br />\nVayne can retort that it is<br />\nprinted on inexpensive newspaper print but why strain false<br />\npoints raised by evasive bureaucrats.<br />\nThe naked truth stands out for<br />\nall who have the honesty to see,<br />\nand that is that these men (and<br />\nthose whom they represent), for<br />\nsome reason which we would<br />\nall do well to investigate, do<br />\nnot want to afford Hopkins students the opportunity to read<br />\nthe Young Socialist. In order<br />\nto repair this deplorable abridgement of the right to read all<br />\nviewpoints in an academic institution, Hopkins students will<br />\nhave to buy individual subscriptions to the Young Socialist until they organize themselves in<br />\ntheir fine tradition of fighting<br />\nfor academic freedom to collectively resist this petty form of<br />\ntyranny over the minds of men.<br />\n(Continued on Page 6)<br /><br />\nfribe,pW &amp;53ivedeivh`l<br />\nNo,friends, no. Rimbaud is not allowed to smoke on the Job<br />\nand when he finishes his long, miserable day he has to buy his<br />\nown Marlboros, even as you and I, in order to settle back and<br />\nenjoy that choice tobacco, that smooth, mellow flavor, that incomparable filter, that pack or box.<br />\nWell, friends, you might as well give up because you'll never<br />\nin a million years guess why Rimbaud works for the Acme Ice<br />\nCompany. The reason is simply this; Rimbaud is a seal!<br />\nHe started as a performing seal in vaudeville. One night on<br />\nthe way to the Ed Sullivan show, he took the wrong subway.<br />\nAll night the poor mammal rode the B.M.T., seeking a helping<br />\nhand. Finally a kindly brakeman named Ernest Thompson<br />\nSigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud.<br />\nHe took Rimbaud home and raised him as his own, and<br />\nRimbaud, to show his appreciation, studied hard and got excellent marks and finished a distinguished academic career as<br />\nvaledictorian of M.I.T.<br />\nRimbaud never complained to his kindly foster father, but<br />\nthrough all those years of grammar school and high school and<br />\ncollege, he darn near died of the heat! A seal, you must remember, is by nature a denizen of the Arctic, so you can imagine how poor Rimbaud must have suffered in subtropical<br />\nNew York and Boston, especially in those tight Ivy League<br />\nsuits.<br />\nBut today at the Acme Ice Company, Rimbaud has finally<br />\nfound a temperature to his liking.

He also<br />\nhad the distinction of not missing a shot all evening, connectting for 3 for 3 from the floor<br />\nand 5 straight from the line.<br />\nWhile all this was going on,<br />\nGreenberg was in the process of<br />\nfinishing the game with 20<br /><br />\npoints and 21 rebounds, although<br />\nhe had to sit out a part because<br />\nof personal fouls.<br />\nIn the last two minutes of the<br />\ngame, Jack White, Pete Thompson and John Heller came in to<br />\nrelieve the victorious Jays. Haller scored 2 and White closed<br />\nout the game by making both<br />\nhalves of a 1 and 1 situation.<br />\nNot to be overlooked in this<br />\narray of figures is the fine work<br />\nof Phil Berger. Berger, who only<br />\nscored three points all evening,<br />\nnonetheless turned in a fine defensive effort, and played his<br />\nusual fine role as leader of the<br />\nJays' floor game.<br />\nThe game was otherwise notable for two things. The first of<br />\nthese is the fine foul shooting<br />\npercentage of the team, which<br />\nhit for 21 of 24 penalty shots.<br />\nThe other was that despite he<br />\nfine performance, the fledglings<br />\nshowed the effects of the twoweek examination layoff.<br /><br />\nran into more bad luck. A series<br />\nof missed \"chippies,\" bad shots,<br />\nand poor. defensive plays saw the<br />\nscore jump to 65.34 midway<br />\nthrough the period. Piling it on,<br />\nthe Terrors scored an additional<br />\n25 in the last half of the period<br />\nand completed the massacre.<br />\nThe play of the Jays was<br />\nhighlighted only by the fine rebounding of Rick Saull. The<br />\nteam, however, made up for this<br />\nat least threefold by shooting an<br />\natrocious 24.7% from the floor.<br />\nHad the teams shooting been at<br />\nall sharp, it is not inconceivable<br />\nthat they could have given the<br />\nWestminster team something of<br />\na fight.<br />\nThe addition of Engel, Lewis<br />\nand Cohne could not take its<br />\nfull effect since in return for the<br />\nservices of these three players,<br />\nwho were not in shape due to a<br />\nlong layoff, the team traded the<br />\nservices of Jaan Sulg, who was<br />\nfelled by academic deficiencies,<br />\nand Al Freeland, who sprained<br />\nhis ankle. As a result, the Jays<br />\nwere nowhere near top form for<br />\nthis game. The Jays have shown<br />\na rapid recovery from the<br />\ntrouncing in this week's practice<br /><br />\nsessions, however.<br />\nThe game was notable for its<br />\nlack of one thing. No matter<br />\nwhat the final result may have<br />\nbeen, in the past the Jays usually<br />\ngave their opponents a battle in<br />\nthe first half, rarely being behind<br />\nby more than a few points. Monday night, however, the team<br />\nallowed the Terrors to completely wallop them in the first half.<br />\nTo add insult to injury, the victory was the first for the Terrors<br />\nat Homewood since 1956.<br />\nImmediately after this defeat,<br />\nhowever, the Jays received some<br />\nwelcome news. Gene Edynak, a<br />\nsenior, reported out for the team.<br />\nEdynak, who had some experience a few years ago at Lafayette, is reputed to be an excellent shot, something the Jays<br />\nsorely need, especially in light of<br />\nthe shooting percentage for the<br />\nlast game and the team's crying<br />\nneed for a rebounder.<br />\nEdynak makes his varsity<br />\ndebut tomorrow at Ursinus,<br />\nwhere the Jays travel in quest<br />\nof their fourth victory in thirteen starts.

Macksey, \"bears the<br />\nimprint of Lovejoy.\" It is the<br />\nemobodiment of Dr. Lovejoy's<br />\napproach to the study of philosophy. Its members, in an<br />\natmosphere of discussion, attempt to sift out those dominant<br />\nideas which have influenced<br />\nman's thought and life for centuries.<br />\nThe study of the history of<br />\nideas as an approach to philosophy is a comparatively new<br />\nidea itself. It was originated by<br /><br />\nschools went through six rounds<br />\nof debate on Friday, Feb. 3 and<br />\nSat., Feb. 4. In accordance with<br />\nthe traditional form of the Hopkins Tournament, in which winners are matched against other<br />\nwinners in successive rounds,<br />\nonly one team emerged without<br />\na loss after the regular six<br />\nrounds. Holy Cross College was<br />\nthe unbeaten team, followed<br />\nclosely by King's College with<br />\na 5-1 record, King's having succumbed to Holy Cross in the<br />\nfifth round. This year a new,<br />\nunique feature was added to the<br />\nHopkins tournament. This was<br />\na Championship Round to be<br />\nheld between the two teams<br />\nwhich had the best record at<br />\nthe end of the regulation six<br />\nrounds and which would decide<br />\nthe winner of the Tournament.<br />\nAccordingly, Holy Cross met<br />\nKing's again in the Championship Round held in Shriver Hall,<br />\nthis time losing to King's, which<br />\nbecame the winner for the second consecutive year.<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 7)<br />\nthree weapons.
