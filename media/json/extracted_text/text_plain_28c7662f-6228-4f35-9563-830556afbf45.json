This<br />\norgan goes on to say:<br />\n\"It is marvelous how some people can wax enthusiastic and energetic about something connected with another city and be as dead as<br />\na piece of granite about the same thing in their own city. Baltimore<br />\nis a university city. It has here a university with an international<br />\nreputation. If the Johns Hopkins University were in some other<br />\ncity, the very atmosphere would be saturated with the college spirit.<br />\nIndeed, the \"college spirit\" is good for any community. There is<br />\nsomething breezy about it which favorably affects everybody. In<br />\nNew Haven, the big business men play hand-in-glove with Yale. In<br />\nBoston, the word \"Harvard\" is synonymous with the business circle.<br />\nThe Princeton feeling pervades all of New Jersey. Not that the business men all went to said universities. But they have caught the<br />\nspirit.. They are in sympathy with it. They encourage it. Why<br />\nnot the same here? Our business men should be as deeply interested in Johns Hopkins' College Life as Bostonians are in Harvard. Our<br />\nbusiness circle should warm up energetically and earnestly in Johns<br />\nHopkins athletics. Indeed, if we could get the swing of this general<br />\n\"college spirit,\" our hearts would beat faster and our life would assume one more ray of brighter hue. Hopkins has more athletic<br />\ndates ahead. Why not put Baltimore behind the boys in a way that<br />\nbusiness men know how to do. Not just a few business men, but<br />\neverybody !\"<br />\nWe are indeed grateful that Baltimore has begun to take cognizance of the fact that \"it has here a university of international reputation.\" Hopkins and Hopkins' activities constitute the best national advertisement that Baltimore possesses.<br />\nAnd while over<br />\ntwenty-five thousand people view a mediocre football game at the<br />\nBaltimore Stadium, barely five thousand attend a classic, the Hopkins-St. John's game at Homewood Field.<br />\nWe give the business men and the general public plenty of opportunity to \"get acquainted with Hopkins.\" Baltimore's support would<br />\nprove of great advantage to Hopkins.

Their inventions<br />\nhave the quality of usefulness, of reliability, of<br />\nproductability; which is an involved way, perhaps, of saying that they have the primary<br />\nrequisite of all really great inventions:<br />\nServiceability.<br />\nEngineering history abounds in instances of<br />\nnear-genius that produced no product, and of<br />\ngreat developments that never reached completion; and most of these instances are explained<br />\nby the lack, somewhere in the system, of that<br />\nability to give real Service.<br />\nService, in a machine or a system, or wherever<br />\nyou find it, is not there by accident but because<br />\nit was incorporated by men who understood<br />\nwhat was required and knew how to provide it.<br />\nMuch more is required of the designer than<br />\nfacility in calculation and mastery of theory.<br />\nHe must have first hand and thorough familiarity<br />\nwith manufacturing operations and with commercial and operating conditions. It takes more<br />\nthan mere ingenuity and inventiveness to design<br />\napparatus that will be really serviceable and<br />\nwill \"stay put.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe design engineer, in the Westinghouse<br />\nplan, is responsible for the performance of the<br />\nfinished product. He cannot possibly have the<br />\nproper understanding of operation unless he operates and tests, unless he spends time and thought<br />\nin investigation and study, not in the laboratory<br />\nor drawing room, but right on the operating<br />\njob. Here, most of his ideas will develop; and<br />\nhere he will see and prepare for all the different<br />\nthings which the product will later have to<br />\nencounter. Then when he comes to put his<br />\ncreations on paper, his calculations will be<br />\nnecessary and helpful to check the conclusions<br />\nwhich he has reached, and this right use of them<br />\nrequires training and a high degree of understanding. This proper balance of the physical<br />\nand mathematical conception of things is what<br />\nconstitutes engineering judgement.<br />\nIt should be thoroughly understood that the<br />\nprimary function of the design engineer is the<br />\nconception and the production of new or improved apparatus, and familiarity with the<br />\npractical is essential to the proper discharge of<br />\nthis duty.<br />\nIt is this view of designing that makes this<br />\nbranch of Westinghouse engineering so important, so effective, and so productive of real<br />\ndevelopments.<br />\n<br />\nWestinghouse<br />\nACHIEVEMENT<br />\n<br />\nOPPORTUNITY<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, NOVEMBER 23, 1923<br />\n<br />\n\"JOHN\", C.

This<br />\norgan goes on to say:<br />\n\"It is marvelous how some people can wax enthusiastic and energetic about something connected with another city and be as dead as<br />\na piece of granite about the same thing in their own city. Baltimore<br />\nis a university city. It has here a university with an international<br />\nreputation. If the Johns Hopkins University were in some other<br />\ncity, the very atmosphere would be saturated with the college spirit.<br />\nIndeed, the \"college spirit\" is good for any community. There is<br />\nsomething breezy about it which favorably affects everybody. In<br />\nNew Haven, the big business men play hand-in-glove with Yale. In<br />\nBoston, the word \"Harvard\" is synonymous with the business circle.<br />\nThe Princeton feeling pervades all of New Jersey. Not that the business men all went to said universities. But they have caught the<br />\nspirit.. They are in sympathy with it. They encourage it. Why<br />\nnot the same here? Our business men should be as deeply interested in Johns Hopkins' College Life as Bostonians are in Harvard. Our<br />\nbusiness circle should warm up energetically and earnestly in Johns<br />\nHopkins athletics. Indeed, if we could get the swing of this general<br />\n\"college spirit,\" our hearts would beat faster and our life would assume one more ray of brighter hue. Hopkins has more athletic<br />\ndates ahead. Why not put Baltimore behind the boys in a way that<br />\nbusiness men know how to do. Not just a few business men, but<br />\neverybody !\"<br />\nWe are indeed grateful that Baltimore has begun to take cognizance of the fact that \"it has here a university of international reputation.\" Hopkins and Hopkins' activities constitute the best national advertisement that Baltimore possesses.<br />\nAnd while over<br />\ntwenty-five thousand people view a mediocre football game at the<br />\nBaltimore Stadium, barely five thousand attend a classic, the Hopkins-St. John's game at Homewood Field.<br />\nWe give the business men and the general public plenty of opportunity to \"get acquainted with Hopkins.\" Baltimore's support would<br />\nprove of great advantage to Hopkins.

Their inventions<br />\nhave the quality of usefulness, of reliability, of<br />\nproductability; which is an involved way, perhaps, of saying that they have the primary<br />\nrequisite of all really great inventions:<br />\nServiceability.<br />\nEngineering history abounds in instances of<br />\nnear-genius that produced no product, and of<br />\ngreat developments that never reached completion; and most of these instances are explained<br />\nby the lack, somewhere in the system, of that<br />\nability to give real Service.<br />\nService, in a machine or a system, or wherever<br />\nyou find it, is not there by accident but because<br />\nit was incorporated by men who understood<br />\nwhat was required and knew how to provide it.<br />\nMuch more is required of the designer than<br />\nfacility in calculation and mastery of theory.<br />\nHe must have first hand and thorough familiarity<br />\nwith manufacturing operations and with commercial and operating conditions. It takes more<br />\nthan mere ingenuity and inventiveness to design<br />\napparatus that will be really serviceable and<br />\nwill \"stay put.\"<br /><br />\nThe design engineer, in the Westinghouse<br />\nplan, is responsible for the performance of the<br />\nfinished product. He cannot possibly have the<br />\nproper understanding of operation unless he operates and tests, unless he spends time and thought<br />\nin investigation and study, not in the laboratory<br />\nor drawing room, but right on the operating<br />\njob. Here, most of his ideas will develop; and<br />\nhere he will see and prepare for all the different<br />\nthings which the product will later have to<br />\nencounter. Then when he comes to put his<br />\ncreations on paper, his calculations will be<br />\nnecessary and helpful to check the conclusions<br />\nwhich he has reached, and this right use of them<br />\nrequires training and a high degree of understanding. This proper balance of the physical<br />\nand mathematical conception of things is what<br />\nconstitutes engineering judgement.<br />\nIt should be thoroughly understood that the<br />\nprimary function of the design engineer is the<br />\nconception and the production of new or improved apparatus, and familiarity with the<br />\npractical is essential to the proper discharge of<br />\nthis duty.<br />\nIt is this view of designing that makes this<br />\nbranch of Westinghouse engineering so important, so effective, and so productive of real<br />\ndevelopments.<br /><br />\nWestinghouse<br />\nACHIEVEMENT<br /><br />\nOPPORTUNITY<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, NOVEMBER 23, 1923<br /><br />\n\"JOHN\", C.
