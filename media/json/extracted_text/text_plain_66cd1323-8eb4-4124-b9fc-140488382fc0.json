The<br />\nactions which resulted in Monday's deaths at Kent State<br />\nwere vivid, chilling examples of the inner torture that<br />\nhas engulfed our nation since American troops invaded<br />\nCambodia last week. The four students are the first<br />\nvictims of the government's blindness and blood lust in<br />\nbeginning the Cambodian War. They will live as testimony of the brutality that has overcome the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nPresident Nixon and his generals have elected to<br />\nignore overwhelming public sentiment to end the war in<br />\nfavor of developing their own fantasy world. To Nixon,<br />\nending the war means beating the hell out of the enemy.<br />\nWe have listened too long to the endless procession of<br />\ninane and insane arguments for our rising involvement in<br />\nIndo-China.<br />\nNixon's response to Monday's death is enlightening:<br />\nhe expressed his sympathy but made it clear that such<br />\ntragedies will become more common if people do not<br />\nbuckle under his decrees. This time, however, people<br />\nare going to fight Mr. Nixon, and fight him until the war<br />\nends.<br />\nHopkins has begun to do its share. The faculty called off today's classes to discuss and protest Cambod<br />\nwhile President Gordon endorsed a telegram denoun ia,<br />\ncing<br />\nNixon's new decisions.

Strike<br />\nleaders there plan to have a large number<br />\nof draft cards turned in at the rally. It is<br />\nhoped that this will be a nationwide movement with all of the cards mailed in to the<br />\nWhite House on a day to be decided this<br />\nweekend.<br />\nIn addition, University of Virginia, Notre<br />\nDame, Brandeis and Stanford all plan protest strikes.

Princeton,<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and<br />\nSarah Lawrence had moved to strike<br />\nlast Sunday. At Columbia,an administration-supported strike and war<br />\ndiscussion took place on Monday,<br />\nfeaturing an address by University<br />\nPresident Andrew Cordier.<br />\nSchools on strike yesterday included Goucher, Wellesley and the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland.

The<br />\nactions which resulted in Monday's deaths at Kent State<br />\nwere vivid, chilling examples of the inner torture that<br />\nhas engulfed our nation since American troops invaded<br />\nCambodia last week. The four students are the first<br />\nvictims of the government's blindness and blood lust in<br />\nbeginning the Cambodian War. They will live as testimony of the brutality that has overcome the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nPresident Nixon and his generals have elected to<br />\nignore overwhelming public sentiment to end the war in<br />\nfavor of developing their own fantasy world. To Nixon,<br />\nending the war means beating the hell out of the enemy.<br />\nWe have listened too long to the endless procession of<br />\ninane and insane arguments for our rising involvement in<br />\nIndo-China.<br />\nNixon's response to Monday's death is enlightening:<br />\nhe expressed his sympathy but made it clear that such<br />\ntragedies will become more common if people do not<br />\nbuckle under his decrees. This time, however, people<br />\nare going to fight Mr. Nixon, and fight him until the war<br />\nends.<br />\nHopkins has begun to do its share. The faculty called off today's classes to discuss and protest Cambod<br />\nwhile President Gordon endorsed a telegram denoun ia,<br />\ncing<br />\nNixon's new decisions. Both actions should be applaud<br />\ned, but they are not enough.<br />\nStudents should be granted a free\"pass\" in their<br />\ncourses. To penalize students academically for working<br />\nto end the Cambodian War is unjust and shortsighted.<br />\nWe also urge that the University take steps for a oneday<br />\nstrike this week in protest of Nixon's policies.<br />\nToday the war will be brought outside the campus<br />\nas students and faculty block Charles Street. Such disruptive measures are necessary to exert pressure on the<br />\ngovernment and to illustrate to the uncommitted our<br />\nadamancy to stop the war.<br />\nBut to exert real force, we must go to the source of<br />\nthe crisis\u2014the White House. So far, Nixon has remained<br />\nsecure in Washington ever confident of his silent majority.<br />\nWe'll walk on the White House Saturday to show him<br />\nhe might be the first President after all to lose a war\u2014a<br />\ndomestic war.<br />\nAmerica is now in one of her greatest internal convulsions.

The<br />\nadministration had previously announced<br />\nthe suspension of Tuesday's classes to<br />\nallow students and faculty to participate<br />\nin a one-day protest.<br />\nOver 200 were arrested during Monday's<br />\ndisorders. All was peaceful yesterday as<br />\nseveral hundred students listened to antiwar speakers.<br />\nAt Goucher, some 800 students and<br />\nfaculty voted two-to-one at a Monday afternoon meeting to suspend Tuesday's classes.<br />\nThe actual suspension of classes is still<br />\nleft up to the individual faculty member<br />\nas the vote is not binding.Goucher students<br />\nare also expected to take advantage of Wednesday's normal absence of classes to support the Hopkins' convocation.<br />\nBerkeley, where war protesters started<br />\na 10-day fast yesterday, plans to join Hop-<br /><br />\nkins in suspending classes on Wednesday<br />\nand holding a similar convocation. Strike<br />\nleaders there plan to have a large number<br />\nof draft cards turned in at the rally. It is<br />\nhoped that this will be a nationwide movement with all of the cards mailed in to the<br />\nWhite House on a day to be decided this<br />\nweekend.<br />\nIn addition, University of Virginia, Notre<br />\nDame, Brandeis and Stanford all plan protest strikes. Students at Yale called for a<br />\ncontinuation of the two-week old strike<br />\nin support of the Black Panther<br />\ns.<br /><br />\nROTC Buildings Burned<br />\nStrikes were also reported at Drew,<br />\nFairleigh Dickinson, University of Rhode<br />\nIsland and Wooster College in Ohio.

Numerous<br />\nburnings of ROTC buildings have also been<br />\nreported, including one Monday night at<br />\nWashington University in St. Louis.<br />\nAt most campuses, continuing protest<br />\nover ROTC and similar issues escalated<br />\ninto the current actions following Nixon's<br />\nannouncement of U.

It was hoped that th group would be able to draw up a common<br />\nlist of demands for the student strikes,<br />\nand make further plans for Saturday's<br />\ndemonstrations.<br />\nHerb Held, Baltimore Moratorium Coordinator, reported that most of the participants were so incensed over the killing of four Kent State (Ohio) students by<br />\nNational Guardsmen that the meeting was<br />\nunable to accomplish anything except affirm that Saturday's action is still on.<br /><br />\nNEws NOTES<br />\nMore Governance<br />\nThe faculty General Assembly<br />\nvoted Saturday to accept the findings of the Howard Committee<br />\nReport on Governance.<br />\nThe Assembly, however, decided to give the responsibility<br />\nof setting up a new Governance<br />\nCommission to Dean-designate<br />\nGeorge Benton. Such a Commission would work during the<br />\nsummer and make final recommendations for a governance system at Homewood next December.<br />\nBenton commented that the Commission would contain both students and faculty members, although he did not specify their<br />\nratios on the Commission.
