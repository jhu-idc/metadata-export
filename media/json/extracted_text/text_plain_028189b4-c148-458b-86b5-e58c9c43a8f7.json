This year the<br />\nsage advice of those in authority was strictly adhered to. Con.<br />\nsequently, there was no cutting of classes; there was no kidnapping<br />\n*<br />\n;(e\u2022=*<br />\nof class officers; no hurried trips were made into the country; the<br />\n*<br />\n\"' *<br />\n*\u2022<br />\nhotels lost nothing on account of the breakage of dishes; and no<br />\nL\u2022<br />\n*<br />\nyouthful attorney-at-law searched the basement for the heroes of the<br />\n41<br />\nfray. In fact, nothing indicated that there were going to be, or had<br />\n\u2022 11010111101.11 VMS*<br />\nbeen banquets, either sophomore or freshman. Yet did not this<br />\n1109111frt101 .<br />\nlifqngliN<br />\n141'...t.<br />\npassive<br />\ninertness seem unnatural? Was not a certain amount of the<br />\n*<br />\nspirit always displayed heretofore, wanting? The college experiences<br />\nof these under-classes will lack a certain amount of savor which so strongly flavors that of<br />\ntheir predecessors. The year appears tame; they have missed something.<br />\nVet this policy shows no lack of spirit; nor does it indicate that the members of the<br />\nclasses did not want to break up the banquets. It does show, however, that the classes took a<br />\nsensible view of the matter, and stuck to it. In the first place, rough-house places the college<br />\nman in an awkward position before the public. It makes him appear too elementary; and the<br />\ndisturbance he creates incurs the disgust of the people for the college permitting it. In the<br />\nsecond place, it is never an advisable policy for students to act in direct opposition to the<br />\ngeneral attitude of the faculty. Therefore, the heads of the respective classes, who, by their<br />\ngood judgment in outlining the course for their classes, prevented a repetition of last year's<br />\ntrouble, and set a new standard for the future, deserve to be congratulated.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ng :04344;0g<br />\n<br />\nHE usual spring-time rumor of an approaching university tennis<br />\ntournament is going the rounds.

She knew<br />\nshe was beautiful and attractive, and that her<br />\npresence was an added charm to any gathering. Consequently, she always timed her<br />\narrival so that it would have the greatest effect.<br />\nMen adored her, and, naturally, every girl<br />\nwho had succeeded in making an impression<br />\nfelt a little uncertain as to how long she would<br />\nbe in the ascendency with this new star on<br />\nthe horizon. Their trepidation was shortlived, however, for apparently the new arrival<br />\nhad eyes for no one in the room. Everybody<br />\nshe saw was an old story to her. She had<br />\nheld captive, at one time or another, every<br />\n'desirable' there. Her partner for the evening was her brother, and when she discovered<br />\nthat there were no new conquests to be made,<br />\nshe turned to him impatiently because she had<br />\nallowed him to influence her to attend.<br />\nAs she ascended the stairs, however, her<br />\neye fell on a new face, a young, handsome,<br />\nwholesome face, but a very innocent one, and<br />\nits look of utter guilelessness interested her.<br />\nThe boy it belonged to rose as she went by,<br />\nand glanced at her from clear eyes of blue.<br />\nHer own black eyes answered him with a<br />\nchallenge, which, although he did not understand it, made him blush. That decided the<br />\nmatter for Miss Parker.<br />\nShe didn't know, of course, that this youth<br />\nshe had just seen was engaged to be married,<br />\nthat he was supposed to be desperately in love<br />\nwith the girl sitting beside him on the stairs,<br />\nwhom she had hardly noticed; but such was<br />\nthe case.<br />\nThey were as common-place a couple as one<br />\ncould well find. Elliott Rowe was a youth of<br />\nabout twenty-two, not clever by any means,<br />\nbut with a pleasing manner that endeared him<br />\nto the hearts of old ladies. He had been<br />\nbrought up in the country by his mother, a<br />\nwell-to-do widow, and his education had been<br />\nentirely at home. It was only when increasing years had made it advisable for him to<br />\nseek some occupation that his mother had<br />\nallowed him to come to the city to enter the<br />\n<br />\nbusiness formerly conducted by his father.<br />\nHe was, in short, a very ordinary boy, goodhearted and wholesome, and by reason of his<br />\nearly training, the slightest bit effeminate.<br />\nHe had not had much experience with the<br />\nworld, and the even tenor of his life had never<br />\nbeen disturbed by any great emotion.<br />\nAnna Martin, the girl, was in some ways,<br />\nmuch like him. She too, had never felt anything very keenly, but her state was the result<br />\nof inability to comprehend rather than lack of<br />\nexperience. All her life, her mother had<br />\npushed her forward, had attempted to make<br />\nher an accomplished woman, and Anna had<br />\ntaken it all in perfect good humor, and had<br />\ntried to fulfill her mother's wishes. She said<br />\nall the little conversational polite phrases that<br />\nthat estimable lady had taught her; when a<br />\ngood story was told she laughed when everybody else laughed, but had no knowledge of<br />\nwhy she laughed. After two seasons out, life<br />\nwas still an incomprehensible book to her.<br />\nAlthough, because her mother desired it, she<br />\nwas willing to mix in the social world, she<br />\nwould have been just as well content to sit at<br />\nhome and fold her hands. It really made no<br />\ndifference to her one way or the other.<br />\nHer pretty face, and simple, confiding manner struck Elliott at their first meeting. He,<br />\ntoo, had failed to grasp as yet the significance<br />\nof the world into which he had been suddenly<br />\nthrust, and this young girl, with her pretty<br />\nface and attractive clothes, who did not try to<br />\nturn his every word into a compliment, nor<br />\nmake confusing witty replies to his commonplace remarks, pleased him mightily, and he<br />\nwent out of his way to make himself attractive to her.<br />\nThe inevitable happened. I don't pretend<br />\nto know whether or not Anna was really in<br />\nlove. I rather believe she was not capable of<br />\nthe sublime passion. But it is certain that<br />\nafter a few months they were together constantly. It used to amuse their friends to<br />\nwonder what they talked about, because two<br />\nsuch unawakened persons were probably never<br />\nbefore thrown together. Their tastes were<br />\nnot diverse\u2014they simply had no tastes.<br />\nWhether, under the warming influence of<br />\nElliott's personali6r, an unsuspected seed of<br />\nlove did sprout and grow into a tiny plant in<br />\nAnna's heart, I am unable to say. I am in-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE7NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nclined to think, however, that the fine hand<br />\nof Mrs. Martin was discernible in the announcement of their engagement, which came<br />\nafter they had known each other about six<br />\nmonths.<br />\nElliott took his good fortune as the most<br />\nnatural thing in the world. He knew that it<br />\nwas the custom for young men to marry, and<br />\nhe felt that he was doing quite the correct<br />\nthing. Anna was not affected in the least.<br />\nShe received the good wishes of her friends<br />\nwith the meaningless smile that had come to<br />\nbe habitual with her. It was only when she<br />\nglanced at Elliott that it became possibly a<br />\nlittle less like the smile of a sleeping child,<br />\nand showed something of the joy of woman's<br />\nlove. Now they were to be married in two<br />\nmonths, and if they thought about it all, both<br />\nimagined themselves very happy and fortunate.<br />\nWhen Lillian came down the stairs again to<br />\nthe room where the dancing was going on,<br />\nshe spoke to her hostess of Elliott, and that<br />\nlady, who, like every one else, had fallen<br />\nunder the charms of the girl's personality<br />\nsought out the callow youth, and presented<br />\nhim, blushing mightily from his remembrance<br />\nof the encounter on the stair.<br />\nLillian received him graciously, however,<br />\nand before he knew it he had asked her for<br />\nthe next dance, quite forgetful of the fact that<br />\nAnna was still sitting up on the stair waiting<br />\nfor his return.<br />\nThe sensuousness of that waltz intoxicated<br />\nhim. Never before had he danced with a<br />\nwoman who yielded herself so completely to<br />\nhis control. When, at its conclusion, he led<br />\nher to a secluded spot beneath the stairs, and<br />\nwas seated by her side, he was sure he had<br />\nnever seen anyone quite so beautiful. This<br />\ncreature of whom he had often heard, and<br />\nwhom he had somehow or other always considered as occupying a height somewhere<br />\nabove him, was seated here at his side. But<br />\nshe was not a grand lady, but a delightful,<br />\ngirlish creature, with a color that came and<br />\nwent, and soft luminous eyes, and the sweetest, most sympathetic of mouths. He was<br />\nemboldened to essay a compliment, which<br />\nshe turned aside lightly, and answered in<br />\nkind. Before he was aware of it, he was<br />\ngrowing confidential. He told of hopes and<br />\nambitions that an hour before he had not<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nknown were existent. She lent a sympathetic<br />\near to all he said, showed an appreciation of<br />\nhis merits, and placed his confessed weaknesses in a light that made them appear<br />\nvirtues.<br />\nMeanwhile little Anna was sitting alone on<br />\nthe stairs, waiting.<br />\nWhen, after Lillian had dismissed him with<br />\nthe promise of another dance before the evening was over, remembrance came to him, and<br />\nhe sought out his fiancee, she received him<br />\njpyfully. There was not a word of reproach<br />\nfor his long desertion. The significance of it<br />\nhad, of course, not dawned upon her. Together they sat upon the stairs, as they had<br />\nbefore. She was just as happy as ever. His<br />\nmind, however, was in a turmoil. Now and<br />\nthen he would catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl he had just left, as she whirled around<br />\nover the polished floor, and he could not help<br />\nmaking mental comparisons. And in these<br />\ncomparisons Anna always suffered. She<br />\nseemed so insignificant. He remembered with<br />\na pang that she had never given him a compliment. He felt like a man who, after gaining his knowledge of flowers from violets, had<br />\njust seen a full-blown crimson rose. He<br />\nwaited for his promised dance with a feverishness that made him pay little outward attention to the girl beside him. He observed with<br />\nalarm that her eyes were blank and expressionless, and he felt an antagonism against<br />\nher rising in his breast. He saw how she<br />\nmust appear to the rest of the world. A disgust with himself welled up in him that he<br />\nhad been so deceived. When, at last, the<br />\npromised dance came he left Anna with<br />\nhardly a word, and hurried to his new-found<br />\ndeity. Another talk in the solitude of the<br />\nseat beneath the stair, and he felt an added<br />\nrepugnance when he returned to Anna to take<br />\nher home. She, poor girl, if she saw aught<br />\nunusual in her recalcitrant lover's conduct,<br />\nbetrayed no sign, and their ride home was an<br />\nuneventful one from her point of view. She<br />\nprobably spent the night in unbroken slumber.<br />\nNot so Elliott. He hardly closed his eyes<br />\nat all, When he did, it was to dream fitful<br />\ndreams that soon brought him out of his<br />\nsleep. The next day and the next he found<br />\nsome excuse for not going near his betrothed.<br />\nOn the next he happened to meet the cause of<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nall the trouble, as he came home from his<br />\noffice in the evening. They walked together<br />\nuntil it was quite dark. He confessed his engagement, which she probably knew by this<br />\ntime, told her of the awful mistake he had<br />\nmade, and requested and received an invitation to call.<br />\nIt is unnecessary to trace every step of the<br />\nway.

SCHMEISSER.<br />\n<br />\n16th\u2014Johns Hopkins, 1; Lehigh University, 10.<br />\n<br />\nNovember 10, 1908.<br />\n<br />\nThe lacrosse interest was practically extinct<br />\nat the university owing to the fact that the<br />\nteam of 1896 had made a poor showing, but<br />\ntwo things occured which again fanned on the<br />\nlacrosse spark that was left, into a bright<br />\nflame.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued).<br />\n1896.<br />\nWhen we reach the team of 1896 the<br />\nauthorities leave its nothing but some bare<br />\nfacts as to the personnel of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nLacrosse Team and the scores of the games<br />\nplayed, all of which are given below. After<br />\nthe Hullabaloo of 1897 had buried this team<br />\nin a cold grave of facts, the Hullabaloo of<br />\n1898 adds this epitaph, ''our 1896 team made<br />\nsuch a poor showing against Lehigh, being<br />\ndefeated 10 to 1, that all lovers of the game<br />\nat Hopkins became disgusted.<br />\n'Varsity Team '96; M.

May<br />\n<br />\n1897.<br />\n<br />\nOne of these thing, was that William Harvey<br />\nMaddren, one of the members of the Crescent<br />\nAthletic Club Team, came to Hopkins to<br />\nstudy. He was full of enthusiasm for the<br />\ngame and at the same time had ability and<br />\nexperience ill organizing and coaching lacrosse<br />\nmen. The other favorable circumstance was<br />\nthat the university did not maintain a football<br />\nteam in the fall of 1896, and the men had no<br />\nathletic work with which to fill in their<br />\nrecreation hours.<br />\nMaddren was elected captain and immediately set to work in his characteristic way<br />\nto boom lacrosse. A call for candidates was<br />\nmade as early as the middle of October and in<br />\naddition to the three men who were left over<br />\nfrom the preceding season a large number of<br />\npromising men responded, most of whom were<br />\nvery lightly burdened with lacrosse knowledge. A mass meeting was then held and<br />\nafter many speeches, it was decided that<br />\neverybody would put his shoulders to the<br />\nwheel and push for another good lacrosse<br />\nteam.<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nEvery day the candidates were put through<br />\na course of tipping and throwing in the yard,<br />\nwhich has since been made the resting place<br />\nof our beautiful cage, and which then adjoined<br />\nthe old gymnasium with its stove around<br />\nwhich stories were swapped which are now<br />\ntaken care of in our more commodious trophy<br />\nroom.<br />\nThree steps in the development of this<br />\nteam must be mentioned, as it showed with<br />\nwhat determination the men worked: First,<br />\nno man was allowed to play on the team who<br />\ndid not do a certain amount of 'gym\" work.<br />\nSecondly, on Saturdays, the men went out<br />\nto Druid Hill Park and scrub games were<br />\nplayed. Thirdly, on about February first,<br />\nthe men were put on a training diet which<br />\nwas adhered to throughout the season.<br />\nOur '97 team had more practice games than<br />\nany Hopkins lacrosse team ever had had up<br />\nto that time. This was of great benefit to<br />\nthe green men, who would most certainly<br />\nhave lost their heads in the. championship<br />\ncontests, but for this previous experience.<br />\nOur boys made a victorious record until the<br />\nLehigh game, when history in substance<br />\nreports that being a new team they were<br />\nsomewhat afflicted with over-confidence. The<br />\ngame itself was one of the prettiest and evenlymatched contests that has ever been played.<br />\nLehigh excelled in tipping and catching,<br />\nwhereas our boys were better runners and<br />\nwere better trained. Lehigh won by a score<br />\nof 6-3 and we did not get the championship.<br />\nThe team finished the season in Brooklyn<br />\nby playing a game with the Crescent Athletic<br />\nClub Team in which they learned a great deal,<br />\nbut were defeated by a score of 5-2.<br />\nThus ended the most prosperous season our<br />\nlacrosse men had since 1891, when we won<br />\nour first Intercollegiate Championship of the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nAttention must be called to the fact that it<br />\nwas this year under the direction of ''Billy\"<br />\nMaddren and '`Jack\" Curry of the Crescent<br />\nAthletic Club Team, who came down a few<br />\ndays from New York City to give our men<br />\nsome points, that the Hopkins system received<br />\nits inception. Curry said; \u2014Take the ball<br />\ndown the middle of the field that is the<br />\nshortest way,\" and from this beginning<br />\n<br />\ndeveloped the Hopkins ''criss-cross\" and its<br />\nlater modifications.<br />\nThe team of 1896 was composed of the<br />\nfollowing pleyers:<br />\nC. M. Guggenheimer, goal; William H.<br />\nMaddren, point; F. A. Lupton, cover point;<br />\nWilliam L. Hodges, first defense; T. A.<br />\nKennard, second defense; F. W.

Naylor, in home.<br />\nSubstitutes\u2014G. W. Knapp, E. Armstrong.<br />\nWilliam H. Maddren, captain; Stephen P.<br />\nHarwood, manager.<br />\n1898.<br />\nOn studying the year book for the year<br />\n1899 on the subject of lacrosse, I find that<br />\nthe writer of the article in that annual was so<br />\noverjoyed and carried away by the fact that<br />\nHopkins had won another championship after<br />\na wait of seven years, that he burst forth in a<br />\npoetic effort, the last verse of which, and that<br />\nonly, will I take the liberty to inflict on the<br />\npatient reader. It reads:<br />\n\"And that old banner of Ninety-one,<br />\nWhich lonely in our gym has hung,<br />\nAt last has found its sequel, mate,<br />\nIn the championship banner of Ninety-eight.\"<br />\n<br />\nAfter this he breaks into a flowing stream<br />\ncovering an entire page, which may be summed up as follows: ``The championship is<br />\ndue to the consistent hard work and ability of<br />\nWilliam H. Maddren.\"<br />\nHow the different men played, and what<br />\ntechnical improvement was to be seen in the<br />\nwork of the team as a whole and if any, what<br />\nnew methods were employed is not set forth<br />\nin the above-mentioned Hullabaloo, so the<br />\nbest the writer can do is to give you a few<br />\ngeneral facts which have been handed down<br />\nby word of mouth.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that it was in this<br />\nyear that R. T. Abercrombie and Toni Fitzgerald first began to work in. Details of their<br />\ncareer will be taken up later.<br />\nIt was also this year that Charles R. McInnes, who after playing a great game of hockey<br />\nas Rover for the University, was induced by<br />\nMaddren and Abercrombie to take up lacrosse.<br />\nHe had fooled around on the lots a bit in<br />\nCanada when he was a boy, but then only as<br />\n<br />\n\f9<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETrER.<br />\n<br />\na close defense man. It was not until the<br />\nend of the season of 1898 that he first sprung<br />\ninto prominence as a close attack man.<br />\nSome of the younger men who have been<br />\nin the trophy room may have seen two small<br />\npennants with the name \"Crescents\" on<br />\nthem, hanging on the wall and wondered<br />\nwhy these. They were presented to our team<br />\nof 1898 by the \"Crescent\" men because we<br />\nhad won the championship.<br />\nAnother point of historical interest is the<br />\nfact that this was the first year that the<br />\nathletic authorities decided that the lacrosse<br />\nmen must win the championship of the lacrosse<br />\nleague to get the letter H and not only be<br />\nawarded the same on a general showing.<br />\nThe team of 1898 lined up as follows:<br />\nC.

This year the<br />\nsage advice of those in authority was strictly adhered to. Con.<br />\nsequently, there was no cutting of classes; there was no kidnapping<br />\n*<br />\n;(e\u2022=*<br />\nof class officers; no hurried trips were made into the country; the<br />\n*<br />\n\"' *<br />\n*\u2022<br />\nhotels lost nothing on account of the breakage of dishes; and no<br />\nL\u2022<br />\n*<br />\nyouthful attorney-at-law searched the basement for the heroes of the<br />\n41<br />\nfray. In fact, nothing indicated that there were going to be, or had<br />\n\u2022 11010111101.11 VMS*<br />\nbeen banquets, either sophomore or freshman. Yet did not this<br />\n1109111frt101 .<br />\nlifqngliN<br />\n141'...t.<br />\npassive<br />\ninertness seem unnatural? Was not a certain amount of the<br />\n*<br />\nspirit always displayed heretofore, wanting? The college experiences<br />\nof these under-classes will lack a certain amount of savor which so strongly flavors that of<br />\ntheir predecessors. The year appears tame; they have missed something.<br />\nVet this policy shows no lack of spirit; nor does it indicate that the members of the<br />\nclasses did not want to break up the banquets. It does show, however, that the classes took a<br />\nsensible view of the matter, and stuck to it. In the first place, rough-house places the college<br />\nman in an awkward position before the public. It makes him appear too elementary; and the<br />\ndisturbance he creates incurs the disgust of the people for the college permitting it. In the<br />\nsecond place, it is never an advisable policy for students to act in direct opposition to the<br />\ngeneral attitude of the faculty. Therefore, the heads of the respective classes, who, by their<br />\ngood judgment in outlining the course for their classes, prevented a repetition of last year's<br />\ntrouble, and set a new standard for the future, deserve to be congratulated.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\ng :04344;0g<br /><br />\nHE usual spring-time rumor of an approaching university tennis<br />\ntournament is going the rounds. THE NEWS-LETTER has made an<br />\n21<br />\n22 22<br />\n21<br />\n21 21 22<br />\n.<br />\n22<br />\nannual appeal for a tennis tournament, from time immemorial; this<br />\nyear there is not the slightest reason why we should not have one.<br />\nWe have our own most excellent courts and dressing-rooms in a conru!<br />\nvenient location.<br />\nThe matter should not be left to incompetent hands, but should<br />\n41.<br />\nIt rt It<br />\nbe<br />\nby the Athletic Board, or a responsible undergraduate<br />\nmanaged<br />\nTz<br />\n4* 4.\u2022 st 4t,It glo?r.eecommittee. We suggest that the entrance-fee be low and that only<br />\ntwo or three rounds be scheduled for each week, so that those who<br />\nhave four lab. periods would not be put to inconvenience. There would be plenty of time to<br />\ncomplete the tournament if started promptly as soon as the weather is warm.<br /><br />\nWe congratulate Dr. Kirby Flower Smith on his appointment to the school board of the<br />\nCity of Baltimore. We are sure that his labors there will be a worthy addition to the already<br />\nlong list of services rendered to the City and State by members of the faculty of this<br />\nuniversity.<br /><br />\nSPRING.<br />\nSpring has come upon us;<br />\nOur campus is free from ice.<br />\nThe boys are pitching nickles,<br />\nInstead of throwing dice.<br />\nThe cage is now deserted;<br />\nThe haven is Homewood field;<br />\nFor to training in athletics<br />\nAll other pleasures yield.<br />\nThose who do not play lacrosse,<br />\nBut excel in other sports<br />\nCan find 'way out at Homewood.<br />\nFine cinder tennis-courts.<br />\nThe shrine of Bacchus still remains<br />\nWits its cooling drinks galore.<br />\nIts keeps its crowd of worshippers<br />\nWho order cock-tails, more and more.<br />\nThe halls are all forsaken<br />\nBut only one you'll find; \u2014<br />\nUpstairs in the library,<br />\nThe lonely, lonely grind.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE AWAKENING OF ELLIOTT ROWE.<br />\nThe dance was at its height, nearly every<br />\none had picked out his especial \"strike\" for<br />\nthe evening, and the cozy corners and stairs<br />\nwere already working overtime, when Lillian<br />\nParker arrived.<br />\nIt was her way of doing things. She knew<br />\nshe was beautiful and attractive, and that her<br />\npresence was an added charm to any gathering. Consequently, she always timed her<br />\narrival so that it would have the greatest effect.<br />\nMen adored her, and, naturally, every girl<br />\nwho had succeeded in making an impression<br />\nfelt a little uncertain as to how long she would<br />\nbe in the ascendency with this new star on<br />\nthe horizon. Their trepidation was shortlived, however, for apparently the new arrival<br />\nhad eyes for no one in the room. Everybody<br />\nshe saw was an old story to her. She had<br />\nheld captive, at one time or another, every<br />\n'desirable' there. Her partner for the evening was her brother, and when she discovered<br />\nthat there were no new conquests to be made,<br />\nshe turned to him impatiently because she had<br />\nallowed him to influence her to attend.<br />\nAs she ascended the stairs, however, her<br />\neye fell on a new face, a young, handsome,<br />\nwholesome face, but a very innocent one, and<br />\nits look of utter guilelessness interested her.<br />\nThe boy it belonged to rose as she went by,<br />\nand glanced at her from clear eyes of blue.<br />\nHer own black eyes answered him with a<br />\nchallenge, which, although he did not understand it, made him blush. That decided the<br />\nmatter for Miss Parker.<br />\nShe didn't know, of course, that this youth<br />\nshe had just seen was engaged to be married,<br />\nthat he was supposed to be desperately in love<br />\nwith the girl sitting beside him on the stairs,<br />\nwhom she had hardly noticed; but such was<br />\nthe case.<br />\nThey were as common-place a couple as one<br />\ncould well find. Elliott Rowe was a youth of<br />\nabout twenty-two, not clever by any means,<br />\nbut with a pleasing manner that endeared him<br />\nto the hearts of old ladies. He had been<br />\nbrought up in the country by his mother, a<br />\nwell-to-do widow, and his education had been<br />\nentirely at home. It was only when increasing years had made it advisable for him to<br />\nseek some occupation that his mother had<br />\nallowed him to come to the city to enter the<br /><br />\nbusiness formerly conducted by his father.<br />\nHe was, in short, a very ordinary boy, goodhearted and wholesome, and by reason of his<br />\nearly training, the slightest bit effeminate.<br />\nHe had not had much experience with the<br />\nworld, and the even tenor of his life had never<br />\nbeen disturbed by any great emotion.<br />\nAnna Martin, the girl, was in some ways,<br />\nmuch like him. She too, had never felt anything very keenly, but her state was the result<br />\nof inability to comprehend rather than lack of<br />\nexperience. All her life, her mother had<br />\npushed her forward, had attempted to make<br />\nher an accomplished woman, and Anna had<br />\ntaken it all in perfect good humor, and had<br />\ntried to fulfill her mother's wishes. She said<br />\nall the little conversational polite phrases that<br />\nthat estimable lady had taught her; when a<br />\ngood story was told she laughed when everybody else laughed, but had no knowledge of<br />\nwhy she laughed. After two seasons out, life<br />\nwas still an incomprehensible book to her.<br />\nAlthough, because her mother desired it, she<br />\nwas willing to mix in the social world, she<br />\nwould have been just as well content to sit at<br />\nhome and fold her hands. It really made no<br />\ndifference to her one way or the other.<br />\nHer pretty face, and simple, confiding manner struck Elliott at their first meeting. He,<br />\ntoo, had failed to grasp as yet the significance<br />\nof the world into which he had been suddenly<br />\nthrust, and this young girl, with her pretty<br />\nface and attractive clothes, who did not try to<br />\nturn his every word into a compliment, nor<br />\nmake confusing witty replies to his commonplace remarks, pleased him mightily, and he<br />\nwent out of his way to make himself attractive to her.<br />\nThe inevitable happened. I don't pretend<br />\nto know whether or not Anna was really in<br />\nlove. I rather believe she was not capable of<br />\nthe sublime passion. But it is certain that<br />\nafter a few months they were together constantly. It used to amuse their friends to<br />\nwonder what they talked about, because two<br />\nsuch unawakened persons were probably never<br />\nbefore thrown together. Their tastes were<br />\nnot diverse\u2014they simply had no tastes.<br />\nWhether, under the warming influence of<br />\nElliott's personali6r, an unsuspected seed of<br />\nlove did sprout and grow into a tiny plant in<br />\nAnna's heart, I am unable to say. I am in-<br /><br />\nTHE7NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nclined to think, however, that the fine hand<br />\nof Mrs. Martin was discernible in the announcement of their engagement, which came<br />\nafter they had known each other about six<br />\nmonths.<br />\nElliott took his good fortune as the most<br />\nnatural thing in the world. He knew that it<br />\nwas the custom for young men to marry, and<br />\nhe felt that he was doing quite the correct<br />\nthing. Anna was not affected in the least.<br />\nShe received the good wishes of her friends<br />\nwith the meaningless smile that had come to<br />\nbe habitual with her. It was only when she<br />\nglanced at Elliott that it became possibly a<br />\nlittle less like the smile of a sleeping child,<br />\nand showed something of the joy of woman's<br />\nlove. Now they were to be married in two<br />\nmonths, and if they thought about it all, both<br />\nimagined themselves very happy and fortunate.<br />\nWhen Lillian came down the stairs again to<br />\nthe room where the dancing was going on,<br />\nshe spoke to her hostess of Elliott, and that<br />\nlady, who, like every one else, had fallen<br />\nunder the charms of the girl's personality<br />\nsought out the callow youth, and presented<br />\nhim, blushing mightily from his remembrance<br />\nof the encounter on the stair.<br />\nLillian received him graciously, however,<br />\nand before he knew it he had asked her for<br />\nthe next dance, quite forgetful of the fact that<br />\nAnna was still sitting up on the stair waiting<br />\nfor his return.<br />\nThe sensuousness of that waltz intoxicated<br />\nhim. Never before had he danced with a<br />\nwoman who yielded herself so completely to<br />\nhis control. When, at its conclusion, he led<br />\nher to a secluded spot beneath the stairs, and<br />\nwas seated by her side, he was sure he had<br />\nnever seen anyone quite so beautiful. This<br />\ncreature of whom he had often heard, and<br />\nwhom he had somehow or other always considered as occupying a height somewhere<br />\nabove him, was seated here at his side. But<br />\nshe was not a grand lady, but a delightful,<br />\ngirlish creature, with a color that came and<br />\nwent, and soft luminous eyes, and the sweetest, most sympathetic of mouths. He was<br />\nemboldened to essay a compliment, which<br />\nshe turned aside lightly, and answered in<br />\nkind. Before he was aware of it, he was<br />\ngrowing confidential. He told of hopes and<br />\nambitions that an hour before he had not<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nknown were existent. She lent a sympathetic<br />\near to all he said, showed an appreciation of<br />\nhis merits, and placed his confessed weaknesses in a light that made them appear<br />\nvirtues.<br />\nMeanwhile little Anna was sitting alone on<br />\nthe stairs, waiting.<br />\nWhen, after Lillian had dismissed him with<br />\nthe promise of another dance before the evening was over, remembrance came to him, and<br />\nhe sought out his fiancee, she received him<br />\njpyfully. There was not a word of reproach<br />\nfor his long desertion. The significance of it<br />\nhad, of course, not dawned upon her. Together they sat upon the stairs, as they had<br />\nbefore. She was just as happy as ever. His<br />\nmind, however, was in a turmoil. Now and<br />\nthen he would catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl he had just left, as she whirled around<br />\nover the polished floor, and he could not help<br />\nmaking mental comparisons. And in these<br />\ncomparisons Anna always suffered. She<br />\nseemed so insignificant. He remembered with<br />\na pang that she had never given him a compliment. He felt like a man who, after gaining his knowledge of flowers from violets, had<br />\njust seen a full-blown crimson rose. He<br />\nwaited for his promised dance with a feverishness that made him pay little outward attention to the girl beside him. He observed with<br />\nalarm that her eyes were blank and expressionless, and he felt an antagonism against<br />\nher rising in his breast. He saw how she<br />\nmust appear to the rest of the world. A disgust with himself welled up in him that he<br />\nhad been so deceived. When, at last, the<br />\npromised dance came he left Anna with<br />\nhardly a word, and hurried to his new-found<br />\ndeity. Another talk in the solitude of the<br />\nseat beneath the stair, and he felt an added<br />\nrepugnance when he returned to Anna to take<br />\nher home. She, poor girl, if she saw aught<br />\nunusual in her recalcitrant lover's conduct,<br />\nbetrayed no sign, and their ride home was an<br />\nuneventful one from her point of view. She<br />\nprobably spent the night in unbroken slumber.<br />\nNot so Elliott. He hardly closed his eyes<br />\nat all, When he did, it was to dream fitful<br />\ndreams that soon brought him out of his<br />\nsleep. The next day and the next he found<br />\nsome excuse for not going near his betrothed.<br />\nOn the next he happened to meet the cause of<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nall the trouble, as he came home from his<br />\noffice in the evening. They walked together<br />\nuntil it was quite dark. He confessed his engagement, which she probably knew by this<br />\ntime, told her of the awful mistake he had<br />\nmade, and requested and received an invitation to call.<br />\nIt is unnecessary to trace every step of the<br />\nway. His engagement with Anna Martin<br />\nwas broken off before two weeks were over.<br />\nThe poor girl has probably not realized to this<br />\nday just what was the trouble.<br />\nBut Elliott realized before many weeks<br />\nwere over that he, too, like the many, was<br />\nbut a pastime for Miss Parker. It affected<br />\nhim quite deeply at first, but his newly<br />\nawakened knowledge of the world came to<br />\nhis aid, and Ile soon became reconciled to<br />\nseeing Miss Parker proceed in her cause of<br />\nheart-breaking.<br /><br />\nA WRECKED ROMANCE.<br /><br />\n``I can't get your number on account of<br />\nthe storm.\"<br />\nAnd the awful, awful truth floated over<br />\nme: it was our own dear telephone operator!<br /><br />\n\"THE WOMAN TEMPTED ME. . . .<br />\nShe looked so kind o' pretty when I seen her<br />\nin the door,<br />\nA sort o' softy-sweetness what she'd never<br />\nhad before.<br />\nShe held her hand out friendly like, I swear I<br />\nclean forgot<br />\nAnd held it rather longer, squeezed it harder<br />\nthan I ought.<br />\nBut\u2014<br />\nI didn't mean no harm.<br />\nShe took me in the dinin' room, and set me<br />\ndown to tea;<br />\nThere wasn't nobody around, exceptin' her<br />\nand me,<br />\nShe waited on me all the time\u2014that pie was<br />\nawful good\u2014<br />\nI know I oughtn't 'a' done it, but I kissed<br />\nher where she stood.<br />\nBut\u2014<br />\nI didn't mean no harm.<br /><br />\nMaxwell was nearly an hour late.

SCHMEISSER.<br /><br />\n16th\u2014Johns Hopkins, 1; Lehigh University, 10.<br /><br />\nNovember 10, 1908.<br /><br />\nThe lacrosse interest was practically extinct<br />\nat the university owing to the fact that the<br />\nteam of 1896 had made a poor showing, but<br />\ntwo things occured which again fanned on the<br />\nlacrosse spark that was left, into a bright<br />\nflame.<br /><br />\n(Continued).<br />\n1896.<br />\nWhen we reach the team of 1896 the<br />\nauthorities leave its nothing but some bare<br />\nfacts as to the personnel of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nLacrosse Team and the scores of the games<br />\nplayed, all of which are given below. After<br />\nthe Hullabaloo of 1897 had buried this team<br />\nin a cold grave of facts, the Hullabaloo of<br />\n1898 adds this epitaph, ''our 1896 team made<br />\nsuch a poor showing against Lehigh, being<br />\ndefeated 10 to 1, that all lovers of the game<br />\nat Hopkins became disgusted.<br />\n'Varsity Team '96; M.

May<br /><br />\n1897.<br /><br />\nOne of these thing, was that William Harvey<br />\nMaddren, one of the members of the Crescent<br />\nAthletic Club Team, came to Hopkins to<br />\nstudy. He was full of enthusiasm for the<br />\ngame and at the same time had ability and<br />\nexperience ill organizing and coaching lacrosse<br />\nmen. The other favorable circumstance was<br />\nthat the university did not maintain a football<br />\nteam in the fall of 1896, and the men had no<br />\nathletic work with which to fill in their<br />\nrecreation hours.<br />\nMaddren was elected captain and immediately set to work in his characteristic way<br />\nto boom lacrosse. A call for candidates was<br />\nmade as early as the middle of October and in<br />\naddition to the three men who were left over<br />\nfrom the preceding season a large number of<br />\npromising men responded, most of whom were<br />\nvery lightly burdened with lacrosse knowledge. A mass meeting was then held and<br />\nafter many speeches, it was decided that<br />\neverybody would put his shoulders to the<br />\nwheel and push for another good lacrosse<br />\nteam.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nEvery day the candidates were put through<br />\na course of tipping and throwing in the yard,<br />\nwhich has since been made the resting place<br />\nof our beautiful cage, and which then adjoined<br />\nthe old gymnasium with its stove around<br />\nwhich stories were swapped which are now<br />\ntaken care of in our more commodious trophy<br />\nroom.<br />\nThree steps in the development of this<br />\nteam must be mentioned, as it showed with<br />\nwhat determination the men worked: First,<br />\nno man was allowed to play on the team who<br />\ndid not do a certain amount of 'gym\" work.<br />\nSecondly, on Saturdays, the men went out<br />\nto Druid Hill Park and scrub games were<br />\nplayed. Thirdly, on about February first,<br />\nthe men were put on a training diet which<br />\nwas adhered to throughout the season.<br />\nOur '97 team had more practice games than<br />\nany Hopkins lacrosse team ever had had up<br />\nto that time. This was of great benefit to<br />\nthe green men, who would most certainly<br />\nhave lost their heads in the. championship<br />\ncontests, but for this previous experience.<br />\nOur boys made a victorious record until the<br />\nLehigh game, when history in substance<br />\nreports that being a new team they were<br />\nsomewhat afflicted with over-confidence. The<br />\ngame itself was one of the prettiest and evenlymatched contests that has ever been played.<br />\nLehigh excelled in tipping and catching,<br />\nwhereas our boys were better runners and<br />\nwere better trained. Lehigh won by a score<br />\nof 6-3 and we did not get the championship.<br />\nThe team finished the season in Brooklyn<br />\nby playing a game with the Crescent Athletic<br />\nClub Team in which they learned a great deal,<br />\nbut were defeated by a score of 5-2.<br />\nThus ended the most prosperous season our<br />\nlacrosse men had since 1891, when we won<br />\nour first Intercollegiate Championship of the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nAttention must be called to the fact that it<br />\nwas this year under the direction of ''Billy\"<br />\nMaddren and '`Jack\" Curry of the Crescent<br />\nAthletic Club Team, who came down a few<br />\ndays from New York City to give our men<br />\nsome points, that the Hopkins system received<br />\nits inception. Curry said; \u2014Take the ball<br />\ndown the middle of the field that is the<br />\nshortest way,\" and from this beginning<br /><br />\ndeveloped the Hopkins ''criss-cross\" and its<br />\nlater modifications.<br />\nThe team of 1896 was composed of the<br />\nfollowing pleyers:<br />\nC. M. Guggenheimer, goal; William H.<br />\nMaddren, point; F. A. Lupton, cover point;<br />\nWilliam L. Hodges, first defense; T. A.<br />\nKennard, second defense; F. W.

Naylor, in home.<br />\nSubstitutes\u2014G. W. Knapp, E. Armstrong.<br />\nWilliam H. Maddren, captain; Stephen P.<br />\nHarwood, manager.<br />\n1898.<br />\nOn studying the year book for the year<br />\n1899 on the subject of lacrosse, I find that<br />\nthe writer of the article in that annual was so<br />\noverjoyed and carried away by the fact that<br />\nHopkins had won another championship after<br />\na wait of seven years, that he burst forth in a<br />\npoetic effort, the last verse of which, and that<br />\nonly, will I take the liberty to inflict on the<br />\npatient reader. It reads:<br />\n\"And that old banner of Ninety-one,<br />\nWhich lonely in our gym has hung,<br />\nAt last has found its sequel, mate,<br />\nIn the championship banner of Ninety-eight.\"<br /><br />\nAfter this he breaks into a flowing stream<br />\ncovering an entire page, which may be summed up as follows: ``The championship is<br />\ndue to the consistent hard work and ability of<br />\nWilliam H. Maddren.\"<br />\nHow the different men played, and what<br />\ntechnical improvement was to be seen in the<br />\nwork of the team as a whole and if any, what<br />\nnew methods were employed is not set forth<br />\nin the above-mentioned Hullabaloo, so the<br />\nbest the writer can do is to give you a few<br />\ngeneral facts which have been handed down<br />\nby word of mouth.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that it was in this<br />\nyear that R. T. Abercrombie and Toni Fitzgerald first began to work in. Details of their<br />\ncareer will be taken up later.<br />\nIt was also this year that Charles R. McInnes, who after playing a great game of hockey<br />\nas Rover for the University, was induced by<br />\nMaddren and Abercrombie to take up lacrosse.<br />\nHe had fooled around on the lots a bit in<br />\nCanada when he was a boy, but then only as<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETrER.<br /><br />\na close defense man. It was not until the<br />\nend of the season of 1898 that he first sprung<br />\ninto prominence as a close attack man.<br />\nSome of the younger men who have been<br />\nin the trophy room may have seen two small<br />\npennants with the name \"Crescents\" on<br />\nthem, hanging on the wall and wondered<br />\nwhy these. They were presented to our team<br />\nof 1898 by the \"Crescent\" men because we<br />\nhad won the championship.<br />\nAnother point of historical interest is the<br />\nfact that this was the first year that the<br />\nathletic authorities decided that the lacrosse<br />\nmen must win the championship of the lacrosse<br />\nleague to get the letter H and not only be<br />\nawarded the same on a general showing.<br />\nThe team of 1898 lined up as follows:<br />\nC.
