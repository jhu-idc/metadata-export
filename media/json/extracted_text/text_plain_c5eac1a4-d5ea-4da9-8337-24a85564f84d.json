A paucity<br />\nof courses in such a popular area is inexcusable. Admittedly the department is small and great demands are<br />\nmade on the professors but why, in view of an obvious<br />\nmanpower shortage, is it necessary for such excellent<br />\nteachers as Drs. Wasserman and Miller to give survey<br />\ncourses? Since most of the real teaching is done in section anyway would it not he wiser to have lectures read<br />\nby graduate students anti free the professors to give more<br />\nadvanced courses?<br />\nA different state of affairs prevails in the Department of Romance Languages where most of the hest men<br />\ndo not see fit to teach undergraduates at all if it can<br />\npossibly he avoided. Drs. Girard and Edelman, both<br />\nwidely regarded in their fields, are virtually unknown to<br />\nthe average undergraduate. Surely they could he prevailed upon to present at least one non-specialized course<br />\nfor undergraduates who are interested in the literature<br />\nof the periods but lack the proficiency to study it in the<br />\noriginal.<br />\nSuch neglect is not, fortunately, universal. The offerings in history and philosophy are vastly improved in<br />\nvariety anti promise to be 80 in content. The science selections are, as usual, excellent. But by failing in two<br />\nsuch basic areas to adequately bridge the gap between<br />\nintroductory courses and specialized ones, Hopkins fails<br />\nin the realm where it is justifiably proudest of its record;<br />\nit fails to provide its students with a real basis for independent, informed intellectual endeavor.<br /><br />\nIn response to a question about<br />\nher hobbies Miss Baez replied<br />\nthat she had only one: living.<br />\nLife Simple<br />\n\"My life is kind of simpleminded,\" she continued, \"most<br />\nof the time it's like an eternal<br />\nvacation. I limit myself to a<br />\nfew months a year so that I can<br />\nstay myself and not become some<br />\nkind of image.\"<br />\nMiss Baez stated that she<br />\n\"always enjoyed singing before<br />\ncollege audiences.

After sixteen years at<br />\nHopkins, studying the theoretical side of the national economy, the former adviser to<br />\npresidents is making another<br />\nbid for public office.<br />\nAs a sometime candidate for<br />\nthe U.

If one looks objectively<br />\nat the diverse styles of singing,<br />\nhe will discover that only the<br />\nindividual's culture determines<br />\nwhat is, to him, a pleasing voice.<br />\nTo a high class American or<br />\nEuropean, Richard Tucker may<br />\nhave the most pleasing voice, to<br />\nsome people Earl Scruggs, to<br />\nothers, possibly Big Bill Bronzy.<br />\nEach style accentuates and develops different sounds of the<br />\nversatile human voice.

And small wonder. In the whole world there is only<br />\none bathyscape, and only two people can get into it.<br />\nNevertheless, the study of ocean depths is of great importance. Why,do you realize that the ocean is by far the world's<br />\nlargest biological environment? The ocean has more than three<br />\nhundred times as much living room as all the continents and<br />\nislands combined! Unfortunately, only fishes live in it.<br />\nAnd small wonder.

To give you an idea of Balboa's vision, he first<br />\nsaw the Pacific while standing on a peak in Darien, which is<br />\nin Connecticut.<br />\nEven more astounding, when Balboa reached San Francisco,<br />\nhe clearly saw the Hawaiian Islands! Being, as we know, a<br />\nfriendly cuss, Balboa waved merrily to the Hawaiians and<br />\nshouted,\"Great little ocean you got here, kids!\" The Hawaiians,<br />\nalso, as we know, friendly cusses, waved back, declared a half<br />\nholiday, organized a luau, built a cheery fire over which they<br />\nprepared several gallons of poi, a suckling pig, and Captain<br />\nCook.
