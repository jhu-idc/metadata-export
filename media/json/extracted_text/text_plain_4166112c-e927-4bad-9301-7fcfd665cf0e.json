Everybody will respond<br />\nbecause they know the cliche. We<br />\nearl start speaking numbers, which<br />\nmight be an improvement since we<br />\ncan then play baseball or music in<br />\nour spare time.\"<br />\nSpaced between puffs of tobacco<br />\nand sips of coffee (always offered,<br />\nbut never with cream), the chairman of Physics pours out a potpourri<br />\nof ideas, seeming contradictions and<br />\nShock answers.<br />\nThe visual drama is heighten d by<br />\nOwen's cigarette holder. A chain<br />\nsmoker, his fingers disembody the<br />\nblack and gold tube after every 2<br />\ncigarettes with the showmanship of<br />\na virtuoso. Once revived by a new<br />\nfilter the holder weaves through the<br />\nair to the controlled syncopation of<br />\nhis voice.<br />\n. He treats everything with a tight,<br />\nironic smile.<br />\n\"I may sound pompous, but I know<br />\nit. I use humor on myself and humor<br />\n<br />\ngives life enormous texture.\"<br />\nHe talks about action and equally<br />\npowerful reaction. The puppets of<br />\nthe left and right are to Owen part of<br />\nthe absurdity of life.<br />\n\"The appalling thing about our<br />\nsociety is the number of 'OK' and<br />\n'non-OK' phrases. The cliches of the<br />\nradicals and conservatives exemplify the sterility of our form of<br />\nexistence.\"<br />\nA devotee of Ardrey's theory that<br />\nman creates artificial strangers to<br />\nseek his own identity, Owen prides<br />\nhis role as the iconoclast.<br />\n\"To me one of the fallacies of life<br />\nis attaching to peer groups. I do it<br />\ntoo. The whole game is to remain as<br />\n<br />\nsketch by george owen<br />\n<br />\nobjective as possible and realize<br />\nwhen religion, nationality and peer<br />\ngroups artificially set you above<br />\nyour fellow man.\"<br />\nHe has come before the public eye<br />\nonly once in recent times. Standing<br />\nbefore the faculty General Assembly<br />\nlast fall, round sun glasses skewed<br />\ninto eyes sockets, a few papers in his<br />\nhand, Owen dropped a bombshell-he recommended a University-wide<br />\nsenate composed of 48 members.<br />\nThe proposal still holds the respect<br />\nof many.<br />\n\"I think we rreed community<br />\nmental health. It's good therapy<br />\nletting students and faculty express<br />\nthemselves if they feel it in their<br />\nguts.\"<br />\nTo Owen, the university should be<br />\nan intellectual playground where<br />\nheresy is welcomed. Instead it has<br />\n'become a way station to a good job.<br />\n\"People should receive a college<br />\neducation only if they have an<br />\nCollege<br />\nenormous curiosity.<br />\nshouldn't be a vocational school. If<br />\none wants to be a grocer, fine. If he<br />\nwants a Ph.d because it's a fun thing<br />\nto do, fine, and then he can go back<br />\nto being a grocer.\"<br />\nOwen combines his study of<br />\nnuclear physics, mathematics and<br />\nelectronics with art.

It is fine to say that the government's interference with the internal affairs of a university is<br />\ndeplorable, but when you get right down to it, banning<br />\nmilitary recruiting on campus is simply not worth the<br />\nloss in jobs and money.<br />\nOne hundred persons--from secretaries to researchers--would lose their jobs if Department of Defense<br />\nFunds were curtailed. The work of 100 more professors<br />\nand graduate students would also be placed in jeopardy.<br />\nMost of the nearly $3 million in defense contracts and<br />\ngrants allocated to the Baltimore campuses are not<br />\nremotely connected to war research. Much of the work<br />\nbeing done for DOD, particularly on the East Baltimore<br />\ncampuses,could just as conceivably be done for Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare. The fact is that DOD has<br />\nbranched out far beyond pure military concerns. None<br />\nof the work is classified. In many instances, professors<br />\nsimply went to DOD for funds because money was not<br />\navailable elsewhere.<br />\nMost of the people who would suffer from the DOD<br />\ncutback were never represented in Homewood's<br />\nreferendum last spring. Not only were the nonprofessional workers on campus not represented, but<br />\nthe Schools of Medicine and Hygiene were involved in<br />\nthe question.<br />\nMilitary recruiting was--and remains--at best a<br />\nsymbolic issue and its banishment yielded only a<br />\nsymbolic victory. A few recruiters on campus didn't<br />\nmake any difference to the effectiveness of the Pentagon's war machine, and had little practical effect on<br />\nthe lives of most members of the University.<br />\nBut as President Gordon said in his letter to the Deans<br />\nearlier this week, the issue has changed character in the<br />\nlight of new and unavoidable facts.<br />\nBefore, we voted on a question that only concerned the<br />\nThe referendum was<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nmoralistically deemed a vote to save lives. Now,<br />\npeople's lives are at stake.<br />\n<br />\nThe Gut Issue<br />\nOf course the President and Board of Trustees will<br />\nsimply reverse Homewood's referendum of last spring<br />\nto maintain the flow of DOD money. But such<br />\npragmatism should just be the start of a major<br />\nreassessment of Hopkins ties with the government.<br />\nUniversities in general, and Hopkins in particular<br />\nhave become too dependent on Washington. This year 70<br />\nper cent of Hopkins' entire budget will be financed by<br />\nthe government. And in becoming a subject to the<br />\ngovernment's purse strings, Hopkins has lost much of<br />\nits academic independence.<br />\nThe military recruiting clause is the most blatant<br />\nexample. This is not a case of giving money with strings<br />\nattached, but attaching strings to something the<br />\nUniversity has come to depend on. Hopkins has been<br />\ngiven, in effect, an an ultimatum--either accept<br />\nrepresentatives of the military on campus or face<br />\nfinancial strangulation<br />\nSuch an attempt to mold the University coupled with<br />\nthe government's policy to end campus dissent, augurs<br />\na period of repression. Universities will no longer be<br />\nsanctuaries for independent thought but pinnacles for an<br />\never-growing government.<br />\nThe President and Board of Trustees should issue a<br />\nstrong condemnation of the government's strong-armed<br />\ninterference with internal university affairs. In addition, the President and Board should express their<br />\ncollective interest in seeing APL reconvert to civilian<br />\nresearch as fast as possible.<br />\n<br />\nOctober 9, 1970<br />\n<br />\nForum<br />\n<br />\nDependence on DOD<br />\nBy JOHN S. MANN<br />\nThere is an atmosphere of hysteria<br />\ndeveloping about the D.O.D. contracts. One<br />\ncomponent of it is an entrenchment of<br />\nstrongly punitive and vindictive feelings<br />\ntoward the anti-war, anti-military<br />\nmovement on campus, whic!\", it is claimed,<br />\nis responsible for the mess we are in.<br />\nAnother component is a panicky feeling that<br />\nwe are helpless in the tightening grip of<br />\nfederal control of higher education.<br />\nA third component of the hysteria is the<br />\nview that the university is doomed to<br />\ncrumble in the predictable forthcoming<br />\nstruggle among the various factions. I<br />\nshould like to ask that we take a calmer,<br />\nmore long-term, and less self-centered view<br />\nof the situation.<br />\nIn the years since W.W.II, the academic<br />\nprofessions have enjoyed a growth in<br />\nprestige, power, influence, and consumption<br />\nof capital goods which is unprecedented in<br />\nAmerican History. They have also enjoyed<br />\nan amazing growth in sheer numbers. These<br />\ntwo sorts of growth are dangerous to the<br />\nmost stalwart of enterprises.<br />\nBut take something as fragile as a<br />\ndedication to knowledge, and expose it to the<br />\ntemptations of power and prestige in exchange for \"only very minor\" compromises-so minor, let us say, as selection of a<br />\nproblem to be studied--and simultaneously<br />\nexpose it to a massive influx of aspiring<br />\nyoung professionals in whose training a<br />\npersonal dedication to knowing becomes<br />\nnecessarily a decreasingly important<br />\ncriterion for success, and you have the<br />\nmakings of a major force.<br />\nHook, Line and Sinker<br />\nNow I don't know very many individual<br />\nfaculty people whose personal motives I<br />\nwould question. Still, collectively there seems<br />\nto have been an agreement at least to<br />\noverlook certain prices we've been paying<br />\nfor success. Then the agreement became a<br />\nhabit, and then the habit became the very air<br />\nwe breathe, so like the fish who only learns<br />\nthat he lives in water upon being yanked by<br />\nthe hook up into the air, we seem unable to<br />\nrecognize the characteristics of the environment that sustains as under the impact<br />\nof anything less than a disaster.<br />\nNow the hook and line we are caught upon<br />\nis our collective decision to ban military<br />\nrecruitment at the Homewood campus of<br />\nHopkins. But this hook and line did not<br />\ncreate the situation of which it has made us<br />\naware. It is only in combination with subsequent events that the hook and line turns<br />\nout to have called our attention to the fact<br />\nthat we are living in muddy water.<br />\nCongress has yanked the line, and we<br />\nsuddenly, gaspingly, realize that we have<br />\nconditioned ourselves to accept dependence,<br />\nfor our survival, upon the Department of<br />\nDefense.<br />\nEthical Questions<br />\nThere are two ethical questions here, and<br />\nsome practical ones, and none of them have<br />\na great deal to do with the view that all the<br />\ntrouble is caused by the \"movement\"<br />\nconstituency.<br />\n1. Given the role that the U.S.D.O.D. is<br />\ncurrently playing or has recently played in<br />\nViet-Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand,<br />\nGuatemala, Chile, Brazil, Greece, Spain,<br />\nand elsewhere, is it ethically appropriate for<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University to make its<br />\nfacilities available for the hiring of recruits?<br />\n2. Given the delicate conditions required to<br />\nsustain honest intellectual inquiry, is it<br />\nreasonable for a community of scholars to<br />\nallow itself to become financially dependent<br />\nupon an institution whose interests, fundamentally, are quite different from, and<br />\neven upon occasion inconsistent with, the<br />\nscholar's fundamental interest in pursuit of<br />\ntruth?<br />\n<br />\nNow my answer to both of these ethical<br />\nquestions is an unqualified no. It is intolerable that a University dedicated to<br />\nscholarship should be financially dependent<br />\nupon the Department .of Defense.<br />\nPractical Question<br />\nA practical question follows: what options<br />\nare open to us? There are two of them,<br />\nessentially, and they are simple, clear-cut,<br />\nand decisive in terms of establishing what<br />\nsort of a place Hopkins is to be.<br />\n1. We reverse the ban on military<br />\nrecruiting and thereby simultaneously<br />\nconfirm our dependent relation to the D.O.D.<br />\nand our priorities regarding independence,<br />\nscholarship, moral commitment and money.<br />\n2. We confirm the ban on military<br />\nrecruiting and thereby simultaneously<br />\nterminate our dependent relation to D.O.D.<br />\nand, again, assert our priorities with respect<br />\nto independence, scholarship, moral commitment and money.<br />\nNow some further questions follow. The<br />\nmain one is what happens to us under each of<br />\nthe two alternatives.<br />\nIf we choose alternative one, then in my<br />\njudgment this puts to rest permanently the<br />\nUniversity's claim and especially the<br />\nfaculty's claim to special privilege by virtue<br />\n, of commitment to high ends. We become just<br />\nregular people making a buck, neither more<br />\nnor less exalted (excepting the extremes to<br />\nwhich our pretensions have gone) than other<br />\nproduction workers in the American<br />\nEconomy.<br />\nNo More Noble Traditions<br />\nUnder these conditions, there is an implicit<br />\nconfession that there is no longer any noble<br />\nliberal tradition of scholarship to protect<br />\nhere at Hopkins--only the special interests of<br />\na rather self-indulgent group of skilled<br />\nworkers. From my view, these interests are<br />\nmore readily expendable, more justifiably<br />\nsubject to attack when they are in conflict<br />\nwith other interests, than would be an institution seeking to protect a \"noble tradition<br />\nof liberal scholarship,\" and my actions will<br />\nbe in accordance with this view.<br />\nOn the other hand, if we choose alternative<br />\ntwo, we lose 3 million dollars. Now how<br />\nimportant, in the eye of the community of<br />\nscholars, is that 3 million dollars, and what<br />\nrecourse do we have to compensate the loss?<br />\nThere are some complicated questions involved here that I have no answers to. As far<br />\nas my own field goes, which is the study of<br />\neducation, it is very clear to me that many of<br />\nthe most vitally important questions can be<br />\nstudied without large expenditures, and that<br />\nin fact the, well-known expensive studies<br />\nhave produced only very little by way of<br />\neither direct application to practice or<br />\ndurable contribution to fundamental<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nStudies Can Wait<br />\nCertainly it is desirable to do some expensive studies, but by and large no such<br />\nstudies are so pressingly important that they<br />\ncan't be deferred until such a time that they<br />\ncan be conducted without selling freedom of<br />\ninquiry to the D.O.D. I understand that the<br />\nsituation is difficult, say, in physics. But<br />\neven there, at least one noble soul early in<br />\nhis career committed himself explicitly to<br />\nwork on problems that don't require expensive machinery, and he has survived<br />\nhandsomely.<br />\nI don't really know how much we need the<br />\n3 million for research purposes, but let us<br />\nlook at the other question--what recourse do<br />\nwe have if we refuse to comply with D.O.D.<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br />\n<br />\n\fOctober 9, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPage 7<br />\n<br />\nIs the Faculty the University's Keeper?<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\n<br />\nSome people have<br />\nbeen urging the university for<br />\nyears to explore alternative<br />\nmethods of funding; now, I<br />\nsuspect they will finally do so<br />\nseriously.<br />\nLovers of Truth?<br />\nMeanwhile, what would<br />\nhappen, for example, if we<br />\nasked the lovers of truth<br />\nengaged here as faculty<br />\nmembers to voluntarily<br />\nsacrifice some percentage of<br />\n<br />\ntheir salary in order to<br />\ndevelop a fund that would a)<br />\nprovide salaries to replace<br />\nthose lost with the D.O.D.<br />\nfunds and b) pay in some<br />\nsmall way for certain<br />\nresearch efforts. How much<br />\ncould we raise this way? For<br />\nthe sake of securing this<br />\nindependence<br />\nUniversity's<br />\nfrom the D.O.D. I would<br />\npersonally be willing to<br />\ncomply with something like<br />\nthis: A tax or voluntary<br />\ncontribution of 10 per cent of<br />\nany salary between $9,500-and<br />\n$19,000 and 20% of any salary<br />\n<br />\n# of<br />\nProfessors<br />\n<br />\nEarning<br />\naverage of<br />\n<br />\nper cent<br />\ntax<br />\n<br />\nRevenue<br />\n<br />\n186<br />\n101<br />\n<br />\n$14,250<br />\n$25,000<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n20<br />\n<br />\n$265,050<br />\n$505,000<br />\nTotal $770,050<br />\n<br />\nbetween $19,000 and $31,000.<br />\nHow much revenue would this<br />\ngenerate?<br />\nAt left is an approximation<br />\nfor the division of Arts and<br />\nalone.<br />\nSciences<br />\nLive Modestly, Love Learning<br />\nNow these figures are little<br />\nbetter than guesses, but they<br />\ncould be off by quite a margin<br />\nwithout destroying my point.<br />\nWe could raise between 1/ 6<br />\nand 1/ 3 of the lost D.O.D.<br />\nfunds at Homewood alone by<br />\nvoluntary<br />\nsimple<br />\na<br />\nagreement on the part of<br />\nfaculty to live a little more<br />\nmodestly for the sake of the<br />\nhigher learning they profess<br />\nto love so well.<br />\nIf on top of that we<br />\nrestricted other funds, such<br />\nas travel, to cases of absolute<br />\nnecessity (professors earning<br />\n<br />\nunder $10,000 per year after<br />\nthe contribution who are<br />\ninvited to give a paper or<br />\nperform<br />\nsome<br />\nother<br />\nprofessional service could be<br />\na rule of thumb), we could<br />\nprobably<br />\nsurvive<br />\nour<br />\nseverance from D.O.D. quite<br />\nhandily. Do we love learning<br />\nenough to live on a mere<br />\n$25,000 instead of $31,000, or to<br />\nlive on $9,000 instead of<br />\n$10,000?<br />\nThe Problem is Simple<br />\nOf course there are many<br />\nramifications I have not and<br />\ncannot<br />\ndiscuss.<br />\nFundamentally, though, as I said<br />\nat the beginning of this note,<br />\nthe problem is simple. Either<br />\nwe choose subservience to the<br />\nD.O.D. and cooperation with<br />\nthe war effort, in order to<br />\nreceive 3 million dollars, or<br />\n<br />\nwe affirm our independence<br />\nfrom the D.O.D. , OUR<br />\nABHORENCE OF THE<br />\nCURRENT ROLE OF THE<br />\nU. S. Army in world affairs,<br />\nand our determination to seek<br />\nmeans, even involving some<br />\npersonal sacrifice, for<br />\nsalvaging our operation<br />\nwithout the D.O.D.<br />\nIf the University chooses<br />\nthe first course, it will be<br />\nethically defenseless, and will<br />\nsurely reap as it sows.

Everybody will respond<br />\nbecause they know the cliche. We<br />\nearl start speaking numbers, which<br />\nmight be an improvement since we<br />\ncan then play baseball or music in<br />\nour spare time.\"<br />\nSpaced between puffs of tobacco<br />\nand sips of coffee (always offered,<br />\nbut never with cream), the chairman of Physics pours out a potpourri<br />\nof ideas, seeming contradictions and<br />\nShock answers.<br />\nThe visual drama is heighten d by<br />\nOwen's cigarette holder. A chain<br />\nsmoker, his fingers disembody the<br />\nblack and gold tube after every 2<br />\ncigarettes with the showmanship of<br />\na virtuoso. Once revived by a new<br />\nfilter the holder weaves through the<br />\nair to the controlled syncopation of<br />\nhis voice.<br />\n. He treats everything with a tight,<br />\nironic smile.<br />\n\"I may sound pompous, but I know<br />\nit. I use humor on myself and humor<br /><br />\ngives life enormous texture.\"<br />\nHe talks about action and equally<br />\npowerful reaction. The puppets of<br />\nthe left and right are to Owen part of<br />\nthe absurdity of life.<br />\n\"The appalling thing about our<br />\nsociety is the number of 'OK' and<br />\n'non-OK' phrases. The cliches of the<br />\nradicals and conservatives exemplify the sterility of our form of<br />\nexistence.\"<br />\nA devotee of Ardrey's theory that<br />\nman creates artificial strangers to<br />\nseek his own identity, Owen prides<br />\nhis role as the iconoclast.<br />\n\"To me one of the fallacies of life<br />\nis attaching to peer groups. I do it<br />\ntoo. The whole game is to remain as<br /><br />\nsketch by george owen<br /><br />\nobjective as possible and realize<br />\nwhen religion, nationality and peer<br />\ngroups artificially set you above<br />\nyour fellow man.\"<br />\nHe has come before the public eye<br />\nonly once in recent times. Standing<br />\nbefore the faculty General Assembly<br />\nlast fall, round sun glasses skewed<br />\ninto eyes sockets, a few papers in his<br />\nhand, Owen dropped a bombshell-he recommended a University-wide<br />\nsenate composed of 48 members.<br />\nThe proposal still holds the respect<br />\nof many.<br />\n\"I think we rreed community<br />\nmental health. It's good therapy<br />\nletting students and faculty express<br />\nthemselves if they feel it in their<br />\nguts.\"<br />\nTo Owen, the university should be<br />\nan intellectual playground where<br />\nheresy is welcomed. Instead it has<br />\n'become a way station to a good job.<br />\n\"People should receive a college<br />\neducation only if they have an<br />\nCollege<br />\nenormous curiosity.<br />\nshouldn't be a vocational school. If<br />\none wants to be a grocer, fine. If he<br />\nwants a Ph.d because it's a fun thing<br />\nto do, fine, and then he can go back<br />\nto being a grocer.\"<br />\nOwen combines his study of<br />\nnuclear physics, mathematics and<br />\nelectronics with art.

This<br />\ngoal can be achieved only<br />\nwith the full cooperation of<br />\nevery member of the Johns<br />\nHopkins community.\"<br />\nIn the academic year 196970, the University budgeted<br />\nan operating deficit of $2.1<br />\nmillion. The financial report<br />\nfor that year has just been<br />\ncompleted, and it shows that<br />\nthe actual operating expenditures exceeded actual<br />\nrevenues by $2,838,000. To<br />\ncover this deficit, the<br /><br />\nUniversity withdrew heavily<br />\nfrom non-programmed quasiendowment funds.<br />\nThe University hopes to<br />\nachieve some reduction in the<br />\n$4.3 million deficit projected<br />\nfor 1970-71 by economies in<br />\nimand<br />\nexpenditures<br />\nprovements in revenues, but<br />\nit is evident that the current<br />\nyear will again involve heavy<br />\nwithdrawals from capital.<br />\nThe market value of the<br />\nUniversity's total endowment<br />\ntype fund holdings as of<br /><br />\nSeptember 30, 1970, was just<br />\nunder $150 million. Of this<br />\namount, about $60 million are<br />\n\"quasias<br />\nclassified<br />\nendowmenents\" from which<br />\nprincipal as well as income<br />\nmay be spent.<br />\n' But the terms of the gifts<br />\ngreat<br />\nthe<br />\ncomprising<br />\nmajority of these funds<br />\nrestrict their use to specific<br />\nprograms and purposes<br />\nwhich do not necessarily<br />\nmatch the areas of operating<br />\ndeficits.<br /><br />\nThe volume of quasiendowment funds which can<br />\nbe applied to operating<br />\ndeficits is especially limited<br />\nin the Division- of Arts and<br />\nSciences and SAIS.<br />\n\"In these circumstances,\"<br />\nDr. Gordon said, \"we must<br />\nexert ourselves strenuously<br />\nto eliminate any unnecessary<br />\nexpenditures in the current<br />\nyear, to expand revenues,<br />\nand to prepare for 1971-72 a<br />\nreduces<br />\nwhich<br />\nbudget<br />\noperating deficits to tolerable<br />\nlimits.<br /><br />\nBuilding Code<br /><br />\nCampus Corrects Dorm Violations<br />\nThe campus dormitories<br />\nrecently underwent a series<br />\nof changes intended to<br />\ncorrect violations of the<br />\nBuilding Code of Baltimore<br />\nCity.<br />\nThe changes were made at<br />\nthe request of the City<br />\nHousing Authority in conjunction with the Departments of Fire, Health,<br />\nHousing and Community<br />\nDevelopment.<br />\nInstalled over the summer,<br />\nthe modifications cost the<br />\nUniversity between $80,000<br />\nand $90,000 at a time when<br />\nat<br />\nscarce<br />\nare<br />\nfunds<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nThe major violation was<br />\nthat in certain houses, a<br />\ncentral hallway was the only<br />\nconnecting<br />\nexit.

It is fine to say that the government's interference with the internal affairs of a university is<br />\ndeplorable, but when you get right down to it, banning<br />\nmilitary recruiting on campus is simply not worth the<br />\nloss in jobs and money.<br />\nOne hundred persons--from secretaries to researchers--would lose their jobs if Department of Defense<br />\nFunds were curtailed. The work of 100 more professors<br />\nand graduate students would also be placed in jeopardy.<br />\nMost of the nearly $3 million in defense contracts and<br />\ngrants allocated to the Baltimore campuses are not<br />\nremotely connected to war research. Much of the work<br />\nbeing done for DOD, particularly on the East Baltimore<br />\ncampuses,could just as conceivably be done for Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare. The fact is that DOD has<br />\nbranched out far beyond pure military concerns. None<br />\nof the work is classified. In many instances, professors<br />\nsimply went to DOD for funds because money was not<br />\navailable elsewhere.<br />\nMost of the people who would suffer from the DOD<br />\ncutback were never represented in Homewood's<br />\nreferendum last spring. Not only were the nonprofessional workers on campus not represented, but<br />\nthe Schools of Medicine and Hygiene were involved in<br />\nthe question.<br />\nMilitary recruiting was--and remains--at best a<br />\nsymbolic issue and its banishment yielded only a<br />\nsymbolic victory. A few recruiters on campus didn't<br />\nmake any difference to the effectiveness of the Pentagon's war machine, and had little practical effect on<br />\nthe lives of most members of the University.<br />\nBut as President Gordon said in his letter to the Deans<br />\nearlier this week, the issue has changed character in the<br />\nlight of new and unavoidable facts.<br />\nBefore, we voted on a question that only concerned the<br />\nThe referendum was<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nmoralistically deemed a vote to save lives. Now,<br />\npeople's lives are at stake.<br /><br />\nThe Gut Issue<br />\nOf course the President and Board of Trustees will<br />\nsimply reverse Homewood's referendum of last spring<br />\nto maintain the flow of DOD money. But such<br />\npragmatism should just be the start of a major<br />\nreassessment of Hopkins ties with the government.<br />\nUniversities in general, and Hopkins in particular<br />\nhave become too dependent on Washington. This year 70<br />\nper cent of Hopkins' entire budget will be financed by<br />\nthe government. And in becoming a subject to the<br />\ngovernment's purse strings, Hopkins has lost much of<br />\nits academic independence.<br />\nThe military recruiting clause is the most blatant<br />\nexample. This is not a case of giving money with strings<br />\nattached, but attaching strings to something the<br />\nUniversity has come to depend on. Hopkins has been<br />\ngiven, in effect, an an ultimatum--either accept<br />\nrepresentatives of the military on campus or face<br />\nfinancial strangulation<br />\nSuch an attempt to mold the University coupled with<br />\nthe government's policy to end campus dissent, augurs<br />\na period of repression. Universities will no longer be<br />\nsanctuaries for independent thought but pinnacles for an<br />\never-growing government.<br />\nThe President and Board of Trustees should issue a<br />\nstrong condemnation of the government's strong-armed<br />\ninterference with internal university affairs. In addition, the President and Board should express their<br />\ncollective interest in seeing APL reconvert to civilian<br />\nresearch as fast as possible.<br /><br />\nOctober 9, 1970<br /><br />\nForum<br /><br />\nDependence on DOD<br />\nBy JOHN S. MANN<br />\nThere is an atmosphere of hysteria<br />\ndeveloping about the D.O.D. contracts. One<br />\ncomponent of it is an entrenchment of<br />\nstrongly punitive and vindictive feelings<br />\ntoward the anti-war, anti-military<br />\nmovement on campus, whic!\", it is claimed,<br />\nis responsible for the mess we are in.<br />\nAnother component is a panicky feeling that<br />\nwe are helpless in the tightening grip of<br />\nfederal control of higher education.<br />\nA third component of the hysteria is the<br />\nview that the university is doomed to<br />\ncrumble in the predictable forthcoming<br />\nstruggle among the various factions. I<br />\nshould like to ask that we take a calmer,<br />\nmore long-term, and less self-centered view<br />\nof the situation.<br />\nIn the years since W.W.II, the academic<br />\nprofessions have enjoyed a growth in<br />\nprestige, power, influence, and consumption<br />\nof capital goods which is unprecedented in<br />\nAmerican History. They have also enjoyed<br />\nan amazing growth in sheer numbers. These<br />\ntwo sorts of growth are dangerous to the<br />\nmost stalwart of enterprises.<br />\nBut take something as fragile as a<br />\ndedication to knowledge, and expose it to the<br />\ntemptations of power and prestige in exchange for \"only very minor\" compromises-so minor, let us say, as selection of a<br />\nproblem to be studied--and simultaneously<br />\nexpose it to a massive influx of aspiring<br />\nyoung professionals in whose training a<br />\npersonal dedication to knowing becomes<br />\nnecessarily a decreasingly important<br />\ncriterion for success, and you have the<br />\nmakings of a major force.<br />\nHook, Line and Sinker<br />\nNow I don't know very many individual<br />\nfaculty people whose personal motives I<br />\nwould question. Still, collectively there seems<br />\nto have been an agreement at least to<br />\noverlook certain prices we've been paying<br />\nfor success. Then the agreement became a<br />\nhabit, and then the habit became the very air<br />\nwe breathe, so like the fish who only learns<br />\nthat he lives in water upon being yanked by<br />\nthe hook up into the air, we seem unable to<br />\nrecognize the characteristics of the environment that sustains as under the impact<br />\nof anything less than a disaster.<br />\nNow the hook and line we are caught upon<br />\nis our collective decision to ban military<br />\nrecruitment at the Homewood campus of<br />\nHopkins. But this hook and line did not<br />\ncreate the situation of which it has made us<br />\naware. It is only in combination with subsequent events that the hook and line turns<br />\nout to have called our attention to the fact<br />\nthat we are living in muddy water.<br />\nCongress has yanked the line, and we<br />\nsuddenly, gaspingly, realize that we have<br />\nconditioned ourselves to accept dependence,<br />\nfor our survival, upon the Department of<br />\nDefense.<br />\nEthical Questions<br />\nThere are two ethical questions here, and<br />\nsome practical ones, and none of them have<br />\na great deal to do with the view that all the<br />\ntrouble is caused by the \"movement\"<br />\nconstituency.<br />\n1. Given the role that the U.S.D.O.D. is<br />\ncurrently playing or has recently played in<br />\nViet-Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand,<br />\nGuatemala, Chile, Brazil, Greece, Spain,<br />\nand elsewhere, is it ethically appropriate for<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University to make its<br />\nfacilities available for the hiring of recruits?<br />\n2. Given the delicate conditions required to<br />\nsustain honest intellectual inquiry, is it<br />\nreasonable for a community of scholars to<br />\nallow itself to become financially dependent<br />\nupon an institution whose interests, fundamentally, are quite different from, and<br />\neven upon occasion inconsistent with, the<br />\nscholar's fundamental interest in pursuit of<br />\ntruth?<br /><br />\nNow my answer to both of these ethical<br />\nquestions is an unqualified no. It is intolerable that a University dedicated to<br />\nscholarship should be financially dependent<br />\nupon the Department .of Defense.<br />\nPractical Question<br />\nA practical question follows: what options<br />\nare open to us? There are two of them,<br />\nessentially, and they are simple, clear-cut,<br />\nand decisive in terms of establishing what<br />\nsort of a place Hopkins is to be.<br />\n1. We reverse the ban on military<br />\nrecruiting and thereby simultaneously<br />\nconfirm our dependent relation to the D.O.D.<br />\nand our priorities regarding independence,<br />\nscholarship, moral commitment and money.<br />\n2. We confirm the ban on military<br />\nrecruiting and thereby simultaneously<br />\nterminate our dependent relation to D.O.D.<br />\nand, again, assert our priorities with respect<br />\nto independence, scholarship, moral commitment and money.<br />\nNow some further questions follow. The<br />\nmain one is what happens to us under each of<br />\nthe two alternatives.<br />\nIf we choose alternative one, then in my<br />\njudgment this puts to rest permanently the<br />\nUniversity's claim and especially the<br />\nfaculty's claim to special privilege by virtue<br />\n, of commitment to high ends. We become just<br />\nregular people making a buck, neither more<br />\nnor less exalted (excepting the extremes to<br />\nwhich our pretensions have gone) than other<br />\nproduction workers in the American<br />\nEconomy.<br />\nNo More Noble Traditions<br />\nUnder these conditions, there is an implicit<br />\nconfession that there is no longer any noble<br />\nliberal tradition of scholarship to protect<br />\nhere at Hopkins--only the special interests of<br />\na rather self-indulgent group of skilled<br />\nworkers. From my view, these interests are<br />\nmore readily expendable, more justifiably<br />\nsubject to attack when they are in conflict<br />\nwith other interests, than would be an institution seeking to protect a \"noble tradition<br />\nof liberal scholarship,\" and my actions will<br />\nbe in accordance with this view.<br />\nOn the other hand, if we choose alternative<br />\ntwo, we lose 3 million dollars. Now how<br />\nimportant, in the eye of the community of<br />\nscholars, is that 3 million dollars, and what<br />\nrecourse do we have to compensate the loss?<br />\nThere are some complicated questions involved here that I have no answers to. As far<br />\nas my own field goes, which is the study of<br />\neducation, it is very clear to me that many of<br />\nthe most vitally important questions can be<br />\nstudied without large expenditures, and that<br />\nin fact the, well-known expensive studies<br />\nhave produced only very little by way of<br />\neither direct application to practice or<br />\ndurable contribution to fundamental<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nStudies Can Wait<br />\nCertainly it is desirable to do some expensive studies, but by and large no such<br />\nstudies are so pressingly important that they<br />\ncan't be deferred until such a time that they<br />\ncan be conducted without selling freedom of<br />\ninquiry to the D.O.D. I understand that the<br />\nsituation is difficult, say, in physics. But<br />\neven there, at least one noble soul early in<br />\nhis career committed himself explicitly to<br />\nwork on problems that don't require expensive machinery, and he has survived<br />\nhandsomely.<br />\nI don't really know how much we need the<br />\n3 million for research purposes, but let us<br />\nlook at the other question--what recourse do<br />\nwe have if we refuse to comply with D.O.D.<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br /><br />\nOctober 9, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPage 7<br /><br />\nIs the Faculty the University's Keeper?<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br /><br />\nSome people have<br />\nbeen urging the university for<br />\nyears to explore alternative<br />\nmethods of funding; now, I<br />\nsuspect they will finally do so<br />\nseriously.<br />\nLovers of Truth?<br />\nMeanwhile, what would<br />\nhappen, for example, if we<br />\nasked the lovers of truth<br />\nengaged here as faculty<br />\nmembers to voluntarily<br />\nsacrifice some percentage of<br /><br />\ntheir salary in order to<br />\ndevelop a fund that would a)<br />\nprovide salaries to replace<br />\nthose lost with the D.O.D.<br />\nfunds and b) pay in some<br />\nsmall way for certain<br />\nresearch efforts. How much<br />\ncould we raise this way? For<br />\nthe sake of securing this<br />\nindependence<br />\nUniversity's<br />\nfrom the D.O.D. I would<br />\npersonally be willing to<br />\ncomply with something like<br />\nthis: A tax or voluntary<br />\ncontribution of 10 per cent of<br />\nany salary between $9,500-and<br />\n$19,000 and 20% of any salary<br /><br />\n# of<br />\nProfessors<br /><br />\nEarning<br />\naverage of<br /><br />\nper cent<br />\ntax<br /><br />\nRevenue<br /><br />\n186<br />\n101<br /><br />\n$14,250<br />\n$25,000<br /><br />\n10<br />\n20<br /><br />\n$265,050<br />\n$505,000<br />\nTotal $770,050<br /><br />\nbetween $19,000 and $31,000.<br />\nHow much revenue would this<br />\ngenerate?<br />\nAt left is an approximation<br />\nfor the division of Arts and<br />\nalone.<br />\nSciences<br />\nLive Modestly, Love Learning<br />\nNow these figures are little<br />\nbetter than guesses, but they<br />\ncould be off by quite a margin<br />\nwithout destroying my point.<br />\nWe could raise between 1/ 6<br />\nand 1/ 3 of the lost D.O.D.<br />\nfunds at Homewood alone by<br />\nvoluntary<br />\nsimple<br />\na<br />\nagreement on the part of<br />\nfaculty to live a little more<br />\nmodestly for the sake of the<br />\nhigher learning they profess<br />\nto love so well.<br />\nIf on top of that we<br />\nrestricted other funds, such<br />\nas travel, to cases of absolute<br />\nnecessity (professors earning<br /><br />\nunder $10,000 per year after<br />\nthe contribution who are<br />\ninvited to give a paper or<br />\nperform<br />\nsome<br />\nother<br />\nprofessional service could be<br />\na rule of thumb), we could<br />\nprobably<br />\nsurvive<br />\nour<br />\nseverance from D.O.D. quite<br />\nhandily. Do we love learning<br />\nenough to live on a mere<br />\n$25,000 instead of $31,000, or to<br />\nlive on $9,000 instead of<br />\n$10,000?<br />\nThe Problem is Simple<br />\nOf course there are many<br />\nramifications I have not and<br />\ncannot<br />\ndiscuss.<br />\nFundamentally, though, as I said<br />\nat the beginning of this note,<br />\nthe problem is simple. Either<br />\nwe choose subservience to the<br />\nD.O.D. and cooperation with<br />\nthe war effort, in order to<br />\nreceive 3 million dollars, or<br /><br />\nwe affirm our independence<br />\nfrom the D.O.D. , OUR<br />\nABHORENCE OF THE<br />\nCURRENT ROLE OF THE<br />\nU. S. Army in world affairs,<br />\nand our determination to seek<br />\nmeans, even involving some<br />\npersonal sacrifice, for<br />\nsalvaging our operation<br />\nwithout the D.O.D.<br />\nIf the University chooses<br />\nthe first course, it will be<br />\nethically defenseless, and will<br />\nsurely reap as it sows. If the<br />\nUniversity chooses the<br />\nsecond course, it may well be<br />\na unique instance of a<br />\nUniversity twice within 100<br />\nyears pioneering new ways to<br />\norganize the pursuit of<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nJohn S.
