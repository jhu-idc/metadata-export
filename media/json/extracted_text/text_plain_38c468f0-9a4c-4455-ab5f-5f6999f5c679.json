We<br />\nworked together for three years for<br />\nUncle Sam, and though that work<br />\nwasn't appreciated, we both know<br />\nit was good. And I haven't a<br />\ndoubt,\" he chuckled, \"that after a<br />\nwhile they'll find that out, too.\"<br />\nMr. Taft then outlined his subject, \"The Presidency: Its Powers,<br />\nIts Functions and Its Responsibilities.\" He discussed the debates in<br />\nthe constitutional convention regarding a plural or singular executive, and expressed his belief that<br />\nthe term of office might well have<br />\nbeen limited. \"But I don't want<br />\nto tinker with the Constitution.<br />\nBetter have a few spots on the sun,<br />\nthan have it go out altogether.\"<br />\nMr. Taft finally outlined the<br />\npurely executive functions of the<br />\nPresident. He is to consult the<br />\nheads of the different departments<br />\nand obtain their opinions regarding<br />\ncertain subjects. Out of this has<br />\ngrown the present American cabinet system. He signs commissions<br />\n\u2014\"and as there are many officeholders,\" added Mr. Taft, \"this, together with signing his correspondence, is the greatest manual labor<br />\na President does, unless he plays<br />\ngolf.\" The President must communicate with Congress. Mr. Taft<br />\nthen told of an experience of Washington's, when he had taken a treaty<br />\nto Congress. This was debated and<br />\namended until the President became so disgusted that on leaving<br />\nhe turned to his Secretary of War,<br />\nKnox, and said: \"Knox, I'll be<br />\nd\u2014d if I ever come here again.\"<br />\nThough he had made a study of<br />\nWashington, Mr. Taft said he never<br />\nfelt so close to him as when he read<br />\nthis, \"for,\" he said, \"I, too, had a<br />\nKnox in my Cabinet who went to<br />\nCongress with treaties.\"<br />\nThe greatest power of the President is derived, probably, from his<br />\nright to appoint office-holders, while<br />\nhis greatest duty is to see that all<br />\nlaws, including treaties, are properly<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 26, 1915.<br />\n<br />\n11.11i<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nTO ERECT LAYFIELD MEMORIAL<br />\n<br />\nTHE 'VARSITY DOWNS HARVARD<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS WINS RAGGED CONTEST<br />\n<br />\nClass of 1918, in Meeting, Decides to<br />\nErect Tablet at Homewood in Honor<br />\nof the Late \"Bob\" Layfield.,<br />\n<br />\nBlack and Blue Lacrosse Team Defeats<br />\nCrimson Aggregation Easily, 8 to 1.<br />\nHuck and Stuart the Stars.<br />\n<br />\n'Varsity Nine Defeats W.

Hopkins, having won two<br />\nconsecutive times in Class II, made<br />\ntheir debut this year in the first<br />\nclass, and, although the team made<br />\nbetter time than any previous Hopkins team, with the exception of<br />\nthat composed of Stiebel, Grover,<br />\nLloyd and Catlin in 1913, they were<br />\ncompletely outclassed.

Several weeks<br />\nago the officers for nekt year were<br />\nelected. In previous years, this election did not take place until the opening of the scholastic year, but a<br />\ncareful consideration of the matter<br />\nbrought the Association to the conclusion that this new system of election would prove superior to the old<br />\nmethod, in that the officers-elect,<br />\nwho do not go into office until fall,<br />\ncould attend the council meetings and<br />\nhence become acquainted with the<br />\nmethods and rules of governing the<br />\nAssociation before they become active officers.<br />\nEdward P. Hayes was elected<br />\npresident of the Association for<br />\nnext year. Mr. Hayes, who becomes a senior next year, is perhaps<br />\nthe first undergraduate student to<br />\nreceive the honor of holding that<br />\noffice. This fact indicates clearly<br />\nthe tendency of the Association to<br />\nbecome as purely an activity of the<br />\nundergraduate students as possible.<br />\nThe positions of vice-president, recorcing secretary, and treasurer will<br />\nbe filled, respectively, by Monroe<br />\nFiror, R. E. F. Aler and Walter S.<br />\nTaylor. The chairmen of the various committees will be elected in the<br />\nnear future. As is customary, no<br />\nchange occurs in the Advisory Committee.<br />\nThe annual Middle Atlantic Student Conference will be held at<br />\nEagles Mere Park, Pa., from the<br />\nfifteenth to the twenty-third of June.<br />\nSome' time ago the Association announced the organization of an<br />\nEagles Mere Club, membership to<br />\nwhich being restricted only to those<br />\nwho are interested in attending the<br />\nconference. With the date of the<br />\nconference drawing very near, the<br />\nAssociation desires to repeat this<br />\nannouncement with all possible emphasis, fen- it realizes that not only<br />\nshould the University be well represented at this conference, but that<br />\nall who attend will be more than<br />\namply repaid for the expense involved in making the trip, which<br />\nshould not exceed thirty dollars.<br />\nSecretary Sutton has a very attractive booklet for distribution to<br />\nall who are sufficiently interested to<br />\nask for a copy. This booklet sets<br />\nforth very clearly the purposes of<br />\nthe conference, the speakers and<br />\nathletics, and tells exactly how the<br />\ndelegates spend their time at Eagles<br />\nMere.<br />\nThe chapel services were led last<br />\nweek by Rev. Clayton H. Ranc.<br />\nThe attendance at these meetings<br />\nrecently has averaged about twentyfive. It is hoped that with the year<br />\ndrawing to a close this figure will<br />\nbe increased. Mr. Theodore S.<br />\nWill will have charge of the services this week.<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS TO HAVE VAUDEVILLE<br />\nSHOW INSTEAD OF CLASS PLAY<br />\n<br />\nAt the meeting of the senior<br />\nclass on Thursday last several<br />\nthings of import were discussed. it<br />\nhas been definitely decided to hold<br />\nthe class banquet during Senior<br />\nWeek, the exact date being left in<br />\nthe hands of the banquet committee. Another event of great importance was the announcement of<br />\nthe Class Day Committee that the<br />\nusual faculty play would be done<br />\naway with this year and in its<br />\nplace an all-star vaudeville production would be staged. The performers will all be members of the<br />\nsenior class. The bill to date includes pictures, exponents of modern (lancing, acrobats, musicians of<br />\nseveral kinds, animals, operatic selections, a wonderful magician, imitators and a short play. The performance is one that ought to be<br />\nvery successful on this circuit.<br />\nKnowing the popularity with which<br />\nthe all-star production will meet,<br />\nthe management has announced<br />\nthat the box office will close as<br />\nsoon as all of the seats are taken.<br />\nA. Fiske Voshell, chairman of the<br />\nSenior Prom. Committee, says that<br />\nthe dance will be held on the<br />\nThursday or Friday following the<br />\nexams.

We<br />\nworked together for three years for<br />\nUncle Sam, and though that work<br />\nwasn't appreciated, we both know<br />\nit was good. And I haven't a<br />\ndoubt,\" he chuckled, \"that after a<br />\nwhile they'll find that out, too.\"<br />\nMr. Taft then outlined his subject, \"The Presidency: Its Powers,<br />\nIts Functions and Its Responsibilities.\" He discussed the debates in<br />\nthe constitutional convention regarding a plural or singular executive, and expressed his belief that<br />\nthe term of office might well have<br />\nbeen limited. \"But I don't want<br />\nto tinker with the Constitution.<br />\nBetter have a few spots on the sun,<br />\nthan have it go out altogether.\"<br />\nMr. Taft finally outlined the<br />\npurely executive functions of the<br />\nPresident. He is to consult the<br />\nheads of the different departments<br />\nand obtain their opinions regarding<br />\ncertain subjects. Out of this has<br />\ngrown the present American cabinet system. He signs commissions<br />\n\u2014\"and as there are many officeholders,\" added Mr. Taft, \"this, together with signing his correspondence, is the greatest manual labor<br />\na President does, unless he plays<br />\ngolf.\" The President must communicate with Congress.

Several weeks<br />\nago the officers for nekt year were<br />\nelected. In previous years, this election did not take place until the opening of the scholastic year, but a<br />\ncareful consideration of the matter<br />\nbrought the Association to the conclusion that this new system of election would prove superior to the old<br />\nmethod, in that the officers-elect,<br />\nwho do not go into office until fall,<br />\ncould attend the council meetings and<br />\nhence become acquainted with the<br />\nmethods and rules of governing the<br />\nAssociation before they become active officers.<br />\nEdward P. Hayes was elected<br />\npresident of the Association for<br />\nnext year. Mr. Hayes, who becomes a senior next year, is perhaps<br />\nthe first undergraduate student to<br />\nreceive the honor of holding that<br />\noffice. This fact indicates clearly<br />\nthe tendency of the Association to<br />\nbecome as purely an activity of the<br />\nundergraduate students as possible.<br />\nThe positions of vice-president, recorcing secretary, and treasurer will<br />\nbe filled, respectively, by Monroe<br />\nFiror, R. E. F. Aler and Walter S.<br />\nTaylor. The chairmen of the various committees will be elected in the<br />\nnear future. As is customary, no<br />\nchange occurs in the Advisory Committee.<br />\nThe annual Middle Atlantic Student Conference will be held at<br />\nEagles Mere Park, Pa., from the<br />\nfifteenth to the twenty-third of June.<br />\nSome' time ago the Association announced the organization of an<br />\nEagles Mere Club, membership to<br />\nwhich being restricted only to those<br />\nwho are interested in attending the<br />\nconference. With the date of the<br />\nconference drawing very near, the<br />\nAssociation desires to repeat this<br />\nannouncement with all possible emphasis, fen- it realizes that not only<br />\nshould the University be well represented at this conference, but that<br />\nall who attend will be more than<br />\namply repaid for the expense involved in making the trip, which<br />\nshould not exceed thirty dollars.<br />\nSecretary Sutton has a very attractive booklet for distribution to<br />\nall who are sufficiently interested to<br />\nask for a copy.

Clayton H. Ranc.<br />\nThe attendance at these meetings<br />\nrecently has averaged about twentyfive. It is hoped that with the year<br />\ndrawing to a close this figure will<br />\nbe increased.

Another event of great importance was the announcement of<br />\nthe Class Day Committee that the<br />\nusual faculty play would be done<br />\naway with this year and in its<br />\nplace an all-star vaudeville production would be staged. The performers will all be members of the<br />\nsenior class. The bill to date includes pictures, exponents of modern (lancing, acrobats, musicians of<br />\nseveral kinds, animals, operatic selections, a wonderful magician, imitators and a short play. The performance is one that ought to be<br />\nvery successful on this circuit.<br />\nKnowing the popularity with which<br />\nthe all-star production will meet,<br />\nthe management has announced<br />\nthat the box office will close as<br />\nsoon as all of the seats are taken.<br />\nA.
