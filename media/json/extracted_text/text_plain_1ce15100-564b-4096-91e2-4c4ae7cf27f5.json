I've been reading<br />\n<br />\nFred Factorial<br />\n<br />\nhis columns since junior high<br />\nschool and he writes like this all<br />\nthe time. Nothing is sacred with<br />\nMurray. He is totally irreverent. Jim Murray is the Don<br />\nRickles of the sports page. He<br />\nis paid to be sarcastic and<br />\ncynical. So what if Murray<br />\ncriticizes Baltimore? He criticizes everywhere else.<br />\nHe calls the Orioles \"monotonous.\" That's pretty kind<br />\nlanguage if you know Murray.<br />\nHe once called players of a<br />\nbasketball team \"rejects from<br />\nthe old folks' home.\" And if<br />\nBaltimore thinks Murray is<br />\n<br />\ncranking on the Orioles because<br />\nof sour grapes, it better look for<br />\nother ideas. Murray would be<br />\nthe first one to tell you the<br />\nDodgers stunk like hell this year<br />\n(he probably did in one of his<br />\ncolumns) and it would have<br />\nbeen highway robbery if they<br />\nmade it to the World Series.<br />\nEven when the Dodgers won<br />\nthe World Series, Murray<br />\ndidn't like them. \"The Dodgers<br />\nare so cheerless,\" Murray once<br />\nwrote, \"going into the clubhouse after a win is like attending a funeral.\" When the<br />\nChuck Knox Rams were win-<br />\n<br />\nParents Weekend Reiold<br />\nI REFuST -ro<br />\n<br />\nSE<br />\n<br />\nSikc.

Los Angeles? Wrong.<br />\nMurray once called L.A. \"an<br />\novergrown desert community\"<br />\nand its San Fernando Valley<br />\nwas \"populated by squeakyvoiced teeny boppers with<br />\nlimited vocabulary skills.\" New<br />\nYork? Nope\u2014\"only thing big<br />\nabout it is the number of rude<br />\npeople.\" And Pittsburgh. God,<br />\nwas he cruel to Pittsburgh. He<br />\ncalled it \"a tar pit with<br />\nsmokestacks sticking out.\" The<br />\nonly nice thing he could say<br />\nabout St. Louis was that it<br />\nlooked better than the bottom<br />\nof the Mississippi. A dubious<br />\ncompliment. So, Baltimore,<br />\nrest assured that you are not<br />\nalone.<br />\nMurray calls Memorial Stadium a \"Civil War Monument.\" Well, it is not as bad as<br />\nthat, but let's face it, Memorial<br />\nStadium certainly isn't the<br />\nAstrodome. Murray was exaggerative but everyone would<br />\nprobably agree that the Stadium could look a lot better.<br />\nSeats with peeling paint and<br />\nrusting railings aren't exactly<br />\nrare here. Neither are big cracks<br />\nin the concrete.

There is no reason<br />\nto go crazy. Personally, I think<br />\nthe Orioles are one hell of a<br />\nteam. They proved it by winning the World Series. Why<br />\ndon't we let actions speak for<br />\nthemselves? And as for the city itself, who cares what Murray says? Baltimore might not<br />\nbe as glamorous as New York,<br />\nnor as flashy as Los Angeles.<br />\nBut, in its own way, it is sort of<br />\nendearing. Certainly, no one<br />\ncan deny the dramatic improvements made over the last<br />\ndecade. Baltimoreans should<br />\ntake note of that and feel<br />\nproud.<br />\nI certainly hope that this<br />\nwhole thing was just some sort<br />\nof publicity stunt by the mayor's office. If Schaefer really<br />\nwas upset, he's less intelligent<br />\nthan I thought he was. He is<br />\nsupposed to be mayor of the<br />\nseventh largest city in the<br />\nUnited States, not some spoiled ten year-old kid. He should<br />\nlearn something from Elizabeth<br />\nTaylor, who is not exactly Mrs.<br />\nMaturity or anything. I mean,<br />\nhas she ever tried to sue Joan<br />\nRivers? I admit that Murray's<br />\ncolumns can be irritating, but they<br />\nhave to be taken in stride. As a<br />\npolitican, Schaefer should<br />\nrealize that. Oh, and Mayor,<br />\ndon't try the Bronx cheer on<br />\nTV again. It looks really<br />\nfoolish; and besides, Archie<br />\ndoes it a whole lot better.<br />\n<br />\n\f6/OCTOBER 28, 1983<br />\n<br />\nDrama Critic Perkins Speaks at Homewood<br />\nby Sujata Banerjee<br />\n<br />\nToby Perkins, drama critic<br />\non the Maryland Center for<br />\nPublic Broadcasting program<br />\n\"Critics' Place,\" spoke to the<br />\nEvening College's Critics in the<br />\nArts class last Tuesday about<br />\nthe special role he plays as a<br />\ndrama critic in television.<br />\nPerkins said drama critics<br />\nmust satisfy both theatrical and<br />\n\"real\" requirements.

According to<br />\nCarol Gray, Dean of Nursing,<br />\nthe program will combine<br />\n\"technology and humaneness.\"<br />\nAlready over 450 inquiries<br />\nhave been made about the Nursing School. Nancy Boothby, a<br />\ngraduate of the Unversity of<br />\nTexas will act as admissions officer for the school. The<br />\nBusiness Manager is Charles<br />\nElzey, a graduate of St. Johns<br />\nof Annapolis. Dean Grey expects to have a first class of<br />\n35-50 students next fall. More<br />\nstudents will be admitted as the<br />\nprogram fully develops. The<br />\nselection process will be very<br />\nselective for the school is looking for \"the best and brightest<br />\nfrom across the country.\" College sophomores in a pre_<br />\n<br />\nnursing curriculum can apply<br />\nfor admittance at the nursing<br />\nschool. The school will provide<br />\nthe two year undergraduate.<br />\nwith an additional two years of<br />\nintensive clinical training with<br />\nan emphasis on expanded<br />\ntechnology and computer<br />\nscience.<br />\nThe faculty will consist of<br />\none or two full time professors<br />\nand other teachers who would<br />\nhave joint appointments at the<br />\nschool and at one of the<br />\nhospitals participating in the<br />\nconsortium. Faculty will continue the Hopkins tradition by<br />\ncombining research and<br />\nteaching. A degree of Master of<br />\nScience in Nursing is considered<br />\nto be a minimum for appointment to the faculty.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Grey, the<br />\nfuture plans of the nursing<br />\nschool include the admittance<br />\nof freshmen for a four year<br />\nprogram and a graduate school.<br />\nThe graduate school may be<br />\nready for students as soon as<br />\nSeptember of 1986.<br />\nThe students who enter the<br />\nnursing school will be devoting<br />\nthemselves to a vigorous program. They will be taking about<br />\nsixteen credits of courses a<br />\nsemester. Their courses will<br />\nrange from the Principles of'<br />\nNutrition to Systems and<br />\nTechnology I. After two years,<br />\nthe student is given a baccalaureate in nursing. Dean<br />\nGrey said that the mission of<br />\nthe school is not to fulfill the<br />\nneeds of the marketplace but to<br />\ntrain a new kind of Ruse. The<br />\n<br />\nnurse will be clinically educated<br />\nand computer literate. He or<br />\nshe will not be lost in the hightech equipment in hospitals<br />\ntoday.<br />\nBasically, nursing school<br />\nstudents will live in the<br />\nHomewood area. Eventually,<br />\nthey will be considered regular<br />\nuniversity students who are<br />\nworking for a nursing degree,<br />\nsimilar to the bio-medical<br />\nengineering student's relation<br />\nwith the medical school.<br />\nCourses will be added to the<br />\nHomewood curriculum to ac-<br />\n<br />\nDean Carol .1.

The<br />\nKate Macy Ladd endowment<br />\nfund will help fund the nursing<br />\nschool.

Of course, tuition<br />\nand student fees will be applied<br />\nto the nursing school.<br />\nAlthough plans for the nursing school were first announced publicly last November, the<br />\nschool has been under con-<br />\n<br />\nsideration for over a year. After<br />\nthe three hospitals approached<br />\nthe University with the idea for<br />\nthe nursing school, Gray, then<br />\nat the University of Texas, was<br />\nasked to conduct a feasibility<br />\nstudy. The study involved an<br />\n\"internal assessment of the<br />\nHopkins institution and the<br />\nformation of a steering<br />\ncommittee.\"<br />\nOn July 30, 1982, the committee submitted the recommendation for the formation of<br />\nthe nursing school to University Provost Richard Longaker,<br />\nwho then gave support for the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nIn the late 19th century,<br />\nChurch, Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nSinai Hospitals began their nursing schools; however, by the<br />\nearly 1970's with the focus of<br />\nnursing education shifting from<br />\nhospital-based to degree-based<br />\nprograms and fewer students<br />\nbeing attracted to the schools,<br />\nthe schools were forced to<br />\nclose.

Riddle's arrangements<br />\nare never obtrusive, and complement Ronstadt's singing nicely. She is not a first-rate singer,<br />\nbut second-rate versions of<br />\nfirst-rate songs are still easy on<br />\nthe ears, and What's New is a<br />\npleasing, if not memorable,<br />\nalbum.<br />\nMel Torme emerged from the<br />\njungles of Vegas a few years<br />\nago and began recording jazz<br />\nsongs again. When he disappeared to Vegas he was already<br />\nconsidered a fine singer; when<br />\nhe returned he was even better.<br />\nTorme has just released his second collaboration with pianist<br />\nGeorge Shearing, Top Drawer,<br />\nand it is every bit as wonderful<br />\nas their Grammy-winning live<br />\nalbum. Without the use of an<br />\norchestra, Shearing, Torme and<br />\nbassist Don Thompson manage<br />\nto slip into some marvelous<br />\nShvinging grooves without any<br />\neffort at all. They add new life<br />\nto the old standards (dig the<br />\nbop choruses on \"Smoke Gets<br />\nin Your Eyes\" and the melody<br />\nchanges in \"Stardust\") without<br />\naltering the essential beauty of<br />\nthe songs. On the ballad, Mel's<br />\nvoice hangs lightly in the air,<br />\nwhile on the faster tunes he and<br />\nShearing spin long lines around<br />\nand around each other, then<br />\nslip into flawless unison.<br />\nThompson adds to the brew<br />\nwith his deft basslines, and the<br />\nresult is the best vocal album of<br />\nthe year.(Of course, An Evening with George Shearing and<br />\nMel Torme was the best vocal<br />\nof '82, and Mel Torme Live at<br />\nMarty's was same for '81.) Mel<br />\nis the best singer around, and<br />\n<br />\nTop Drawer should not be<br />\nmissed. Pick up the other two<br />\nwhile you're at it.<br />\nAny discussion of singers<br />\nmust mention the tragic death<br />\nlast month of Johnny Hartman. Twenty years ago Ella Fitzgerald called Hartman the<br />\nmost under-rated and underrecorded singer in the world,<br />\nand that didn't change in his<br />\nlast years. Hartman had a deep,<br />\nrich baritone that was always<br />\nemotionally charged; when he<br />\nsang a ballad you felt as though<br />\nhe was sitting in the room with<br />\nyou, talking things out. Hartman will always be remembered<br />\nfor his 1963 collaboration with<br />\nJohn Coltrane, perhaps the<br />\n<br />\nMel Forme: better than ever<br />\n<br />\nclassic jazz vocal album, which<br />\nincludes the definitive reading<br />\nof Billy Strayhorn's \"Lush<br />\n<br />\nLife.\" Johnny was little<br />\nknown, and so probably won't<br />\nbe missed by too many people,<br />\n<br />\nbut those of us who heard him<br />\nwill miss him sorely.<br />\nMore Arts p. /5<br />\n<br />\nFELLOWSHIPS<br />\nSince 1949. more than 4,500 men and women have<br />\nearned advanced degrees in engineering and science<br />\nwith the help of Hughes fellowships.

They<br />\nhave also won 13 straight MAC<br />\nchampionship titles, going for<br />\nnumber 14 this season. As the<br />\nBlue Jays begin training this<br />\nmonth, their goal is to continue<br />\nthis tradition of good swimming and hopefully to improve<br />\nas they have never done before.<br />\nTim Welsh is entering his<br />\nseventh year as head coach of<br />\nthe Blue Jays, and is optimistic about the team's prospects. \"For the first time in a<br />\nwhile, we will be able to cover<br />\nall the events in dual meets this<br />\nyear.\" He said,\"We have some<br />\ngood freshmen and the returning swimmers seem ready for a<br />\ngood season.\"<br />\nThe team is led by three<br />\nsenior captains: Bob Britanisky, a solid national performer<br />\nin breastroke and individual<br />\nmedly; Bob Dyer, a breastroker<br />\nand a strong motivator; and<br />\nMike Leonhardt, one of the<br />\nbest swimmers in Hopkins<br />\nhistory.<br />\nSerious training for the team<br />\nbegan early this month and will<br />\ncontinue until the middle of<br />\nMarch, the date of the Division<br />\nIII Nationals. This season is<br />\none of the longest official<br />\nseasons in collegiate sports. It<br />\nis also one of the toughest<br />\nmentally.<br />\nAccording to Welsh, \"In<br />\nswimming, especially at our<br />\n<br />\nference in natural ability between swimmers, for the majority of athletes, is small.\"<br />\n\"Therefore in a race between<br />\nswimmers of equal natural<br />\ntalent, two factors will determine who wins the race. The<br />\nfirst is, the amount of training<br />\nand background work done<br />\nbefore the race. The second,<br />\nand more difficult to realize, is<br />\nthe amount of mental preparation done before the race.\"<br />\nMental training includes confidence, race strategy, visualization and relaxation. \"Hopkins<br />\nswimmers,\" continued Welsh,<br />\n\"usually are too-keyed up<br />\nbefore a race. We need to let go<br />\nand not force it, especially right<br />\nbefore a race because by that<br />\ntime, any added stress is<br />\ndetrimental.\"<br />\nWith this in mind, the team<br />\nwill spend more time on \"group<br />\nmental training\" than in the<br />\npast.<br />\nWith regards to basic training, most of the swimmers lift<br />\nweights three times a week and<br />\nattend eight of nine practices a<br />\nweek. The yardage varies from<br />\n5,000(three miles) to 7,000(4.5<br />\nmiles) a practice.<br />\n\"We stress training for individual events,\" explained<br />\nWelsh, \"but we also stress endurance and that combination<br />\ngives us an advantage over<br />\nother Division III teams.<br />\nWhen asked why Hopkins<br />\nhas dominated the MAC's for<br />\nover a decade, Welsh responded enthusiastically, \"First<br />\nof all, Hopkins, with its excellent academic reputation and<br />\nswimming tradition, draws<br />\nmany excellent swimmers<br />\nalready capable of Division III<br />\nNational times. Second, we<br />\n<br />\nthe other teams, and third of<br />\nall, we're big on improvement.\" Improvement is a big<br />\nfactor. Every swimmer in coach<br />\nWelsh's program has improved<br />\nin at least one event and usually in more.<br />\nBesides winning their fourteenth MAC championship this<br />\nseason, the Jays are concentrating on placing higher at Nationals. \"For this to happen,\"<br />\nsaid Welsh, \"we are going to<br />\nhave to work harder as individuals but more importantly as a team. We have a lot of<br />\npotential, but in order to<br />\nminimize our performance, we<br />\nhave to work together.\"<br />\nThe team has five potential<br />\nnational qualifiers (including<br />\ntwo divers) this year. Leading<br />\nthe list are multiple AllAmerican, defending (1650) national champion Mike Leonhardt; Junior All-Americans<br />\nDick Johnson, Steve Segreto,<br />\nand Tom Uristek; and sophomore All-Americans Wink<br />\nDyer and Kevin Anderson. But<br />\nthe people who will be crucial<br />\nto Hopkins success are the<br />\nother performers on the team,<br />\nwhose improvement is essential.<br />\nThe first meet of the season<br />\nis the annual Comfort Classic<br />\nIntersquad Scrimmage on<br />\nNovember 5. The team is looking forward to the meet for two<br />\nreasons, but especially to see<br />\nwhere they stand after a month<br />\nof hard training. For those<br />\nstudents who have never been<br />\nto a swim meet, you might want<br />\nto come to the pool and see<br />\nwhat one is really like.

Last<br />\nWednesday, the men's lacrosse<br />\nteam, playing their final scrimmage under Coach Ciccarone,<br />\nripped apart the Delaware Blue<br />\nHens, 22-11.<br />\nThe game was an all-around<br />\noffense show for the Blue Jays<br />\nwith thirteen players getting at<br />\nleast one point and, unlike<br />\nprevious games, no team<br />\nmember scoring more than<br />\nthree goals.<br />\nThe game started slowly<br />\nthough, with the Blue Jays<br />\nscoring only two goals on seven<br />\nfirst period shots and limiting<br />\nthe Hens to only one goal. The<br />\npace quickened next quarter as<br />\nthe Jays' offense went in the<br />\nrampage, firing nineteen shots<br />\nand netting five goals. The<br />\ndefense allowed only one more<br />\ngoal and had very little work,<br />\nwith the offense constantly having possession.<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue .lays' offense kept<br />\nthe pressure on in the second<br />\nhalf, scoring two quick goals<br />\nwithin the first two minutes,<br />\nand increasing the score 10 9-2.<br />\nFollowing an exchange of<br />\ngoals, Hopkins put the game in<br />\nthe bag. A barrage of five goals<br />\nin a three minute span bolstered<br />\nthe Jays to a sixteen goal total<br />\nand must have left the Hen's<br />\ncoach wondering how many<br />\ndefensemen he had.<br />\nThe fourth quarter saw the<br />\nBlue Jays play a more controlled offense, and their patience<br />\npaid off repeatedly. On \u2022 only<br />\nnine shots, the .lays scored six<br />\nmore times, including three<br />\ngoals by Clark Thielmann.<br />\nLarry Quinn started in goal<br />\nfor the Blue Jays and was very<br />\neffective, yielding only two<br />\ngoals and making thirteen saves<br />\nduring his two quarters of play.<br />\nThe remainder of the defense<br />\nwas not quite as good. With the<br />\noffense controlling the game,<br />\nthe defense began to ease off<br />\nalittle. While the game's ending<br />\nwas never really in doubt, their<br />\nplay was certainly a bit embar-<br />\n<br />\nrassing, as they allowed<br />\nDelaware to score five goals in<br />\nthe third period. Quinn's<br />\nreplacement, John Madden,<br />\ndid not play badly (he had six<br />\nsaves); rather, he was a victim<br />\nof the defense's porosity.<br />\nAs the offense contined to<br />\nscore, the defense resisted less<br />\nand less. Stuart .Jones replaced<br />\nMadden in the fourth period<br />\nand found himself in the same<br />\nsituation as Madden\u2014facing<br />\ntoo many close shots. .lones<br />\nhad four saves and allowed<br />\nfour goals.<br />\nWhile the Jays dominated<br />\nDelaware, they weren't able to<br />\ncontrol the face-offs. Lee<br />\nDavidson won just six out of<br />\nsixteen and Glen Fidge won six<br />\nout of eleven. The defense also<br />\nhad just eight groundballs.<br />\nScoring for Blue Jays were:<br />\nKrumenacker(2 g, 2 a), Davidson (3g), Engelke(2g, la), Scott<br />\n(1 g, 3 a), Bubier (3 g, 1 a),<br />\nWood (2 g, 1 a), Odent hal(2 g),<br />\nTheilmann (3 g, 2 a), Chanenchuck (2 g), Castle (1 g, I a),<br />\nSingle (1 g, 1 a), Schreiber (I a),<br />\nand Mutscheller (1 a).<br />\n<br />\nLast week's field hockey photo was erroneously credited to Dave<br />\nThe photo was actually taken by James Paddon.

Next semester is the<br />\nwomen's first spring season,<br />\nwhen they will spend much of<br />\ntheir time dodging the men's<br />\nteam for a share of the courts.<br />\n<br />\n\"It works out that we've<br />\nscheduled our home matches<br />\nwhen the men are away,\"<br />\nFowler said. The men have also<br />\nhinted that they would allow<br />\nsome space for the women during practice. The biggest problem may be that Fowler's<br />\nduties as assistant lacrosse<br />\ncoach may interfere with her<br />\nleadership of the team. She<br />\nnoted, however, that \"if there's<br />\n<br />\na conflict, I can go with the tennis team. The athletic department realizes the importance of<br />\nour team now.\" The fact that<br />\nthe netsters have the best recore<br />\nof any fall sport is a big reason<br />\nfor that realization.<br />\nAfter a 10-3 fall showing,<br />\nperhaps the men's lacrosse<br />\nteam may have to fight a little<br />\nharder to remain the most successful spring sport.<br />\n<br />\nnq Co MIlwaukee<br />\n<br />\nby Howard Bregman<br />\nFor an enormously successful<br />\nBlue Jay women's tennis team,<br />\nthis may be the start of a long<br />\nwinter break rather than just<br />\nthe end of the season.

Every one of the seven<br />\nstarters finished with a winning<br />\nrecord, each taking at least 70%<br />\nof her matches. The same was<br />\ntrue at the doubles positions,<br />\nwhich the team had to rely on<br />\nheavily for their wins last year.<br />\nThis resulted in less pressure on<br />\nthe top singles players, notably<br />\nGeraldine Klauber and Keni<br />\n'Fischer, who almost needed to<br />\nwin individually for the teams<br />\nto win meets.<br />\nThe regular season was completed last Thursday at Swarthmore, one of Hopkins' opponents in the Southeast<br />\nLeague of the MAC Southern<br />\nDivision. This time the Jays did<br />\nnot have to rely on Klauber and<br />\nFischer, whose victories at<br />\nsingles and combined win at<br />\ndoubles provided three of the<br />\nfive wins by which they took<br />\nthe meet.<br />\nKlauber, facing Alice<br />\nEsse!son, took an easy 6-0 set<br />\nafter winning the first, 6-4.<br />\nFischer did as well against<br />\nYvonne Esse!son, by a 7-5, 6-1<br />\ntally. Men -Jo Borzilleri, at<br />\nthird singles, faced tougher<br />\ncompetition from Pam Nelson,<br />\nbut hung in for a 7-5, 3-6, 6-3<br />\nvictory.<br />\nSwarthmore, however, had<br />\nsome reserve power at the lower<br />\npositions. Monica Canilang,<br />\nthe usual sixth singles player<br />\nmoved up to fourth, fell to Kris<br />\nParris, 0-6, 2-6, and Kathy<br />\nMarch, a rare loser at the fifth<br />\nposition, followed with a 3-6,<br />\n4-6 show against Mary Roy.<br />\nTying it up for Swarthmore was<br />\nPam Duke, who nipped the<br />\nJays' Julie North in a marathon<br />\n6-7 (5-7), 7-5 two-setter.<br />\nLast week against Mt. St.<br />\nMary's, the .lays went into<br />\ndoubles play all even and dropped what Coach Kay Fowler<br />\nhad called a \"sure win\" by losing at first and third doubles. In<br />\nthis meet, Canilang and North<br />\nfailed to produce a third<br />\ndoubles, but Fischer and<br />\nKlauber came through with a<br />\n6-4, 7-5 victory.<br />\nOnce again, it came down to<br />\nthe final doubles match. After<br />\nlosing the first set, 3-6, Borzilleri and March took the second, 7-5, against Swarthmore's first and sixth singles<br />\nplayers.

He is totally irreverent. Jim Murray is the Don<br />\nRickles of the sports page. He<br />\nis paid to be sarcastic and<br />\ncynical. So what if Murray<br />\ncriticizes Baltimore? He criticizes everywhere else.<br />\nHe calls the Orioles \"monotonous.\" That's pretty kind<br />\nlanguage if you know Murray.<br />\nHe once called players of a<br />\nbasketball team \"rejects from<br />\nthe old folks' home.\" And if<br />\nBaltimore thinks Murray is<br /><br />\ncranking on the Orioles because<br />\nof sour grapes, it better look for<br />\nother ideas.

Los Angeles? Wrong.<br />\nMurray once called L.A. \"an<br />\novergrown desert community\"<br />\nand its San Fernando Valley<br />\nwas \"populated by squeakyvoiced teeny boppers with<br />\nlimited vocabulary skills.\" New<br />\nYork?

He<br />\ncalled it \"a tar pit with<br />\nsmokestacks sticking out.\" The<br />\nonly nice thing he could say<br />\nabout St. Louis was that it<br />\nlooked better than the bottom<br />\nof the Mississippi. A dubious<br />\ncompliment. So, Baltimore,<br />\nrest assured that you are not<br />\nalone.<br />\nMurray calls Memorial Stadium a \"Civil War Monument.\" Well, it is not as bad as<br />\nthat, but let's face it, Memorial<br />\nStadium certainly isn't the<br />\nAstrodome. Murray was exaggerative but everyone would<br />\nprobably agree that the Stadium could look a lot better.<br />\nSeats with peeling paint and<br />\nrusting railings aren't exactly<br />\nrare here. Neither are big cracks<br />\nin the concrete. If I remember<br />\ncorrectly, Edward Bennet Williams made the city agree to im-<br /><br />\nprovements before he signed a<br />\nnew base.<br />\nBaltimore has nothing to be<br />\nashamed of. There is no reason<br />\nto go crazy. Personally, I think<br />\nthe Orioles are one hell of a<br />\nteam. They proved it by winning the World Series. Why<br />\ndon't we let actions speak for<br />\nthemselves? And as for the city itself, who cares what Murray says? Baltimore might not<br />\nbe as glamorous as New York,<br />\nnor as flashy as Los Angeles.<br />\nBut, in its own way, it is sort of<br />\nendearing. Certainly, no one<br />\ncan deny the dramatic improvements made over the last<br />\ndecade. Baltimoreans should<br />\ntake note of that and feel<br />\nproud.<br />\nI certainly hope that this<br />\nwhole thing was just some sort<br />\nof publicity stunt by the mayor's office. If Schaefer really<br />\nwas upset, he's less intelligent<br />\nthan I thought he was. He is<br />\nsupposed to be mayor of the<br />\nseventh largest city in the<br />\nUnited States, not some spoiled ten year-old kid. He should<br />\nlearn something from Elizabeth<br />\nTaylor, who is not exactly Mrs.<br />\nMaturity or anything. I mean,<br />\nhas she ever tried to sue Joan<br />\nRivers? I admit that Murray's<br />\ncolumns can be irritating, but they<br />\nhave to be taken in stride. As a<br />\npolitican, Schaefer should<br />\nrealize that. Oh, and Mayor,<br />\ndon't try the Bronx cheer on<br />\nTV again.

Heyssel,<br />\nM.D., President of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Medical<br />\nSchool. His efforts have<br />\nestablished a school operated<br />\nby the university and three<br />\nhospitals that will prepare its<br />\nstudents for nursing in the 21st<br />\ncentury. The three hospitals\u2014<br />\nChurch Hospital, Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, and Sinai<br />\nHospital\u2014have joined to form<br />\nthe Consortium for Nursing<br />\nEducation Inc. According to<br />\nCarol Gray, Dean of Nursing,<br />\nthe program will combine<br />\n\"technology and humaneness.\"<br />\nAlready over 450 inquiries<br />\nhave been made about the Nursing School. Nancy Boothby, a<br />\ngraduate of the Unversity of<br />\nTexas will act as admissions officer for the school. The<br />\nBusiness Manager is Charles<br />\nElzey, a graduate of St. Johns<br />\nof Annapolis. Dean Grey expects to have a first class of<br />\n35-50 students next fall. More<br />\nstudents will be admitted as the<br />\nprogram fully develops. The<br />\nselection process will be very<br />\nselective for the school is looking for \"the best and brightest<br />\nfrom across the country.\" College sophomores in a pre_<br /><br />\nnursing curriculum can apply<br />\nfor admittance at the nursing<br />\nschool. The school will provide<br />\nthe two year undergraduate.<br />\nwith an additional two years of<br />\nintensive clinical training with<br />\nan emphasis on expanded<br />\ntechnology and computer<br />\nscience.<br />\nThe faculty will consist of<br />\none or two full time professors<br />\nand other teachers who would<br />\nhave joint appointments at the<br />\nschool and at one of the<br />\nhospitals participating in the<br />\nconsortium. Faculty will continue the Hopkins tradition by<br />\ncombining research and<br />\nteaching. A degree of Master of<br />\nScience in Nursing is considered<br />\nto be a minimum for appointment to the faculty.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Grey, the<br />\nfuture plans of the nursing<br />\nschool include the admittance<br />\nof freshmen for a four year<br />\nprogram and a graduate school.<br />\nThe graduate school may be<br />\nready for students as soon as<br />\nSeptember of 1986.<br />\nThe students who enter the<br />\nnursing school will be devoting<br />\nthemselves to a vigorous program. They will be taking about<br />\nsixteen credits of courses a<br />\nsemester. Their courses will<br />\nrange from the Principles of'<br />\nNutrition to Systems and<br />\nTechnology I. After two years,<br />\nthe student is given a baccalaureate in nursing. Dean<br />\nGrey said that the mission of<br />\nthe school is not to fulfill the<br />\nneeds of the marketplace but to<br />\ntrain a new kind of Ruse. The<br /><br />\nnurse will be clinically educated<br />\nand computer literate. He or<br />\nshe will not be lost in the hightech equipment in hospitals<br />\ntoday.<br />\nBasically, nursing school<br />\nstudents will live in the<br />\nHomewood area. Eventually,<br />\nthey will be considered regular<br />\nuniversity students who are<br />\nworking for a nursing degree,<br />\nsimilar to the bio-medical<br />\nengineering student's relation<br />\nwith the medical school.<br />\nCourses will be added to the<br />\nHomewood curriculum to ac-<br /><br />\nDean Carol .1.

The<br />\nKate Macy Ladd endowment<br />\nfund will help fund the nursing<br />\nschool. The hospitals in the<br />\nconsortium will also aid the<br />\nschool through the Patient Day<br />\nDollar Program. In this program, about one dollar is taken<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n%.\u2022<br /><br />\nfor each day a patient stays in<br />\nthe hospital. Of course, tuition<br />\nand student fees will be applied<br />\nto the nursing school.<br />\nAlthough plans for the nursing school were first announced publicly last November, the<br />\nschool has been under con-<br /><br />\nsideration for over a year. After<br />\nthe three hospitals approached<br />\nthe University with the idea for<br />\nthe nursing school, Gray, then<br />\nat the University of Texas, was<br />\nasked to conduct a feasibility<br />\nstudy. The study involved an<br />\n\"internal assessment of the<br />\nHopkins institution and the<br />\nformation of a steering<br />\ncommittee.\"<br />\nOn July 30, 1982, the committee submitted the recommendation for the formation of<br />\nthe nursing school to University Provost Richard Longaker,<br />\nwho then gave support for the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nIn the late 19th century,<br />\nChurch, Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nSinai Hospitals began their nursing schools; however, by the<br />\nearly 1970's with the focus of<br />\nnursing education shifting from<br />\nhospital-based to degree-based<br />\nprograms and fewer students<br />\nbeing attracted to the schools,<br />\nthe schools were forced to<br />\nclose. After the nursing<br />\nschools' closing, the hospitals<br />\nrealized the lack of a nursing<br />\nprogram on site. They wanted<br />\nthe schools back.

Rolling Stone, of all<br />\nmagazines, printed a full page<br />\nobituary of lyricist Howard<br />\nDietz, an Irving Berlin song was<br />\nrecently in the Top Ten, and<br />\nElvis Costello not only lists<br />\nBillie Holliday and Frank<br />\nSinatra as his major singing influences, but admits that he<br />\naspires to be the Cole Porter of<br />\nthe Eighties. In the last two years<br />\nWillie Nelson and Carly Simon<br />\nhave recorded albums of old<br />\nstandards, Nelson with some<br />\ncuccess and Simon with absolutely none.

Riddle's arrangements<br />\nare never obtrusive, and complement Ronstadt's singing nicely.

When he disappeared to Vegas he was already<br />\nconsidered a fine singer; when<br />\nhe returned he was even better.<br />\nTorme has just released his second collaboration with pianist<br />\nGeorge Shearing, Top Drawer,<br />\nand it is every bit as wonderful<br />\nas their Grammy-winning live<br />\nalbum. Without the use of an<br />\norchestra, Shearing, Torme and<br />\nbassist Don Thompson manage<br />\nto slip into some marvelous<br />\nShvinging grooves without any<br />\neffort at all. They add new life<br />\nto the old standards (dig the<br />\nbop choruses on \"Smoke Gets<br />\nin Your Eyes\" and the melody<br />\nchanges in \"Stardust\") without<br />\naltering the essential beauty of<br />\nthe songs. On the ballad, Mel's<br />\nvoice hangs lightly in the air,<br />\nwhile on the faster tunes he and<br />\nShearing spin long lines around<br />\nand around each other, then<br />\nslip into flawless unison.<br />\nThompson adds to the brew<br />\nwith his deft basslines, and the<br />\nresult is the best vocal album of<br />\nthe year.(Of course, An Evening with George Shearing and<br />\nMel Torme was the best vocal<br />\nof '82, and Mel Torme Live at<br />\nMarty's was same for '81.)

Twenty years ago Ella Fitzgerald called Hartman the<br />\nmost under-rated and underrecorded singer in the world,<br />\nand that didn't change in his<br />\nlast years. Hartman had a deep,<br />\nrich baritone that was always<br />\nemotionally charged; when he<br />\nsang a ballad you felt as though<br />\nhe was sitting in the room with<br />\nyou, talking things out. Hartman will always be remembered<br />\nfor his 1963 collaboration with<br />\nJohn Coltrane, perhaps the<br /><br />\nMel Forme: better than ever<br /><br />\nclassic jazz vocal album, which<br />\nincludes the definitive reading<br />\nof Billy Strayhorn's \"Lush<br /><br />\nLife.\" Johnny was little<br />\nknown, and so probably won't<br />\nbe missed by too many people,<br /><br />\nbut those of us who heard him<br />\nwill miss him sorely.<br />\nMore Arts p. /5<br /><br />\nFELLOWSHIPS<br />\nSince 1949. more than 4,500 men and women have<br />\nearned advanced degrees in engineering and science<br />\nwith the help of Hughes fellowships.

They<br />\nhave also won 13 straight MAC<br />\nchampionship titles, going for<br />\nnumber 14 this season. As the<br />\nBlue Jays begin training this<br />\nmonth, their goal is to continue<br />\nthis tradition of good swimming and hopefully to improve<br />\nas they have never done before.<br />\nTim Welsh is entering his<br />\nseventh year as head coach of<br />\nthe Blue Jays, and is optimistic about the team's prospects. \"For the first time in a<br />\nwhile, we will be able to cover<br />\nall the events in dual meets this<br />\nyear.\" He said,\"We have some<br />\ngood freshmen and the returning swimmers seem ready for a<br />\ngood season.\"<br />\nThe team is led by three<br />\nsenior captains: Bob Britanisky, a solid national performer<br />\nin breastroke and individual<br />\nmedly; Bob Dyer, a breastroker<br />\nand a strong motivator; and<br />\nMike Leonhardt, one of the<br />\nbest swimmers in Hopkins<br />\nhistory.<br />\nSerious training for the team<br />\nbegan early this month and will<br />\ncontinue until the middle of<br />\nMarch, the date of the Division<br />\nIII Nationals. This season is<br />\none of the longest official<br />\nseasons in collegiate sports. It<br />\nis also one of the toughest<br />\nmentally.<br />\nAccording to Welsh, \"In<br />\nswimming, especially at our<br /><br />\nference in natural ability between swimmers, for the majority of athletes, is small.\"<br />\n\"Therefore in a race between<br />\nswimmers of equal natural<br />\ntalent, two factors will determine who wins the race. The<br />\nfirst is, the amount of training<br />\nand background work done<br />\nbefore the race. The second,<br />\nand more difficult to realize, is<br />\nthe amount of mental preparation done before the race.\"<br />\nMental training includes confidence, race strategy, visualization and relaxation. \"Hopkins<br />\nswimmers,\" continued Welsh,<br />\n\"usually are too-keyed up<br />\nbefore a race. We need to let go<br />\nand not force it, especially right<br />\nbefore a race because by that<br />\ntime, any added stress is<br />\ndetrimental.\"<br />\nWith this in mind, the team<br />\nwill spend more time on \"group<br />\nmental training\" than in the<br />\npast.<br />\nWith regards to basic training, most of the swimmers lift<br />\nweights three times a week and<br />\nattend eight of nine practices a<br />\nweek. The yardage varies from<br />\n5,000(three miles) to 7,000(4.5<br />\nmiles) a practice.<br />\n\"We stress training for individual events,\" explained<br />\nWelsh, \"but we also stress endurance and that combination<br />\ngives us an advantage over<br />\nother Division III teams.<br />\nWhen asked why Hopkins<br />\nhas dominated the MAC's for<br />\nover a decade, Welsh responded enthusiastically, \"First<br />\nof all, Hopkins, with its excellent academic reputation and<br />\nswimming tradition, draws<br />\nmany excellent swimmers<br />\nalready capable of Division III<br />\nNational times. Second, we<br /><br />\nthe other teams, and third of<br />\nall, we're big on improvement.\" Improvement is a big<br />\nfactor. Every swimmer in coach<br />\nWelsh's program has improved<br />\nin at least one event and usually in more.<br />\nBesides winning their fourteenth MAC championship this<br />\nseason, the Jays are concentrating on placing higher at Nationals. \"For this to happen,\"<br />\nsaid Welsh, \"we are going to<br />\nhave to work harder as individuals but more importantly as a team. We have a lot of<br />\npotential, but in order to<br />\nminimize our performance, we<br />\nhave to work together.\"<br />\nThe team has five potential<br />\nnational qualifiers (including<br />\ntwo divers) this year. Leading<br />\nthe list are multiple AllAmerican, defending (1650) national champion Mike Leonhardt; Junior All-Americans<br />\nDick Johnson, Steve Segreto,<br />\nand Tom Uristek; and sophomore All-Americans Wink<br />\nDyer and Kevin Anderson. But<br />\nthe people who will be crucial<br />\nto Hopkins success are the<br />\nother performers on the team,<br />\nwhose improvement is essential.<br />\nThe first meet of the season<br />\nis the annual Comfort Classic<br />\nIntersquad Scrimmage on<br />\nNovember 5. The team is looking forward to the meet for two<br />\nreasons, but especially to see<br />\nwhere they stand after a month<br />\nof hard training. For those<br />\nstudents who have never been<br />\nto a swim meet, you might want<br />\nto come to the pool and see<br />\nwhat one is really like.

Last<br />\nWednesday, the men's lacrosse<br />\nteam, playing their final scrimmage under Coach Ciccarone,<br />\nripped apart the Delaware Blue<br />\nHens, 22-11.<br />\nThe game was an all-around<br />\noffense show for the Blue Jays<br />\nwith thirteen players getting at<br />\nleast one point and, unlike<br />\nprevious games, no team<br />\nmember scoring more than<br />\nthree goals.<br />\nThe game started slowly<br />\nthough, with the Blue Jays<br />\nscoring only two goals on seven<br />\nfirst period shots and limiting<br />\nthe Hens to only one goal. The<br />\npace quickened next quarter as<br />\nthe Jays' offense went in the<br />\nrampage, firing nineteen shots<br />\nand netting five goals. The<br />\ndefense allowed only one more<br />\ngoal and had very little work,<br />\nwith the offense constantly having possession.<br /><br />\nThe Blue .lays' offense kept<br />\nthe pressure on in the second<br />\nhalf, scoring two quick goals<br />\nwithin the first two minutes,<br />\nand increasing the score 10 9-2.<br />\nFollowing an exchange of<br />\ngoals, Hopkins put the game in<br />\nthe bag. A barrage of five goals<br />\nin a three minute span bolstered<br />\nthe Jays to a sixteen goal total<br />\nand must have left the Hen's<br />\ncoach wondering how many<br />\ndefensemen he had.<br />\nThe fourth quarter saw the<br />\nBlue Jays play a more controlled offense, and their patience<br />\npaid off repeatedly. On \u2022 only<br />\nnine shots, the .lays scored six<br />\nmore times, including three<br />\ngoals by Clark Thielmann.<br />\nLarry Quinn started in goal<br />\nfor the Blue Jays and was very<br />\neffective, yielding only two<br />\ngoals and making thirteen saves<br />\nduring his two quarters of play.<br />\nThe remainder of the defense<br />\nwas not quite as good. With the<br />\noffense controlling the game,<br />\nthe defense began to ease off<br />\nalittle. While the game's ending<br />\nwas never really in doubt, their<br />\nplay was certainly a bit embar-<br /><br />\nrassing, as they allowed<br />\nDelaware to score five goals in<br />\nthe third period. Quinn's<br />\nreplacement, John Madden,<br />\ndid not play badly (he had six<br />\nsaves); rather, he was a victim<br />\nof the defense's porosity.<br />\nAs the offense contined to<br />\nscore, the defense resisted less<br />\nand less. Stuart .Jones replaced<br />\nMadden in the fourth period<br />\nand found himself in the same<br />\nsituation as Madden\u2014facing<br />\ntoo many close shots. .lones<br />\nhad four saves and allowed<br />\nfour goals.<br />\nWhile the Jays dominated<br />\nDelaware, they weren't able to<br />\ncontrol the face-offs. Lee<br />\nDavidson won just six out of<br />\nsixteen and Glen Fidge won six<br />\nout of eleven. The defense also<br />\nhad just eight groundballs.<br />\nScoring for Blue Jays were:<br />\nKrumenacker(2 g, 2 a), Davidson (3g), Engelke(2g, la), Scott<br />\n(1 g, 3 a), Bubier (3 g, 1 a),<br />\nWood (2 g, 1 a), Odent hal(2 g),<br />\nTheilmann (3 g, 2 a), Chanenchuck (2 g), Castle (1 g, I a),<br />\nSingle (1 g, 1 a), Schreiber (I a),<br />\nand Mutscheller (1 a).<br /><br />\nLast week's field hockey photo was erroneously credited to Dave<br />\nThe photo was actually taken by James Paddon.

Next semester is the<br />\nwomen's first spring season,<br />\nwhen they will spend much of<br />\ntheir time dodging the men's<br />\nteam for a share of the courts.<br /><br />\n\"It works out that we've<br />\nscheduled our home matches<br />\nwhen the men are away,\"<br />\nFowler said. The men have also<br />\nhinted that they would allow<br />\nsome space for the women during practice. The biggest problem may be that Fowler's<br />\nduties as assistant lacrosse<br />\ncoach may interfere with her<br />\nleadership of the team. She<br />\nnoted, however, that \"if there's<br /><br />\na conflict, I can go with the tennis team. The athletic department realizes the importance of<br />\nour team now.\" The fact that<br />\nthe netsters have the best recore<br />\nof any fall sport is a big reason<br />\nfor that realization.<br />\nAfter a 10-3 fall showing,<br />\nperhaps the men's lacrosse<br />\nteam may have to fight a little<br />\nharder to remain the most successful spring sport.<br /><br />\nnq Co MIlwaukee<br /><br />\nby Howard Bregman<br />\nFor an enormously successful<br />\nBlue Jay women's tennis team,<br />\nthis may be the start of a long<br />\nwinter break rather than just<br />\nthe end of the season.

Every one of the seven<br />\nstarters finished with a winning<br />\nrecord, each taking at least 70%<br />\nof her matches. The same was<br />\ntrue at the doubles positions,<br />\nwhich the team had to rely on<br />\nheavily for their wins last year.<br />\nThis resulted in less pressure on<br />\nthe top singles players, notably<br />\nGeraldine Klauber and Keni<br />\n'Fischer, who almost needed to<br />\nwin individually for the teams<br />\nto win meets.<br />\nThe regular season was completed last Thursday at Swarthmore, one of Hopkins' opponents in the Southeast<br />\nLeague of the MAC Southern<br />\nDivision. This time the Jays did<br />\nnot have to rely on Klauber and<br />\nFischer, whose victories at<br />\nsingles and combined win at<br />\ndoubles provided three of the<br />\nfive wins by which they took<br />\nthe meet.<br />\nKlauber, facing Alice<br />\nEsse!son, took an easy 6-0 set<br />\nafter winning the first, 6-4.<br />\nFischer did as well against<br />\nYvonne Esse!son, by a 7-5, 6-1<br />\ntally. Men -Jo Borzilleri, at<br />\nthird singles, faced tougher<br />\ncompetition from Pam Nelson,<br />\nbut hung in for a 7-5, 3-6, 6-3<br />\nvictory.<br />\nSwarthmore, however, had<br />\nsome reserve power at the lower<br />\npositions. Monica Canilang,<br />\nthe usual sixth singles player<br />\nmoved up to fourth, fell to Kris<br />\nParris, 0-6, 2-6, and Kathy<br />\nMarch, a rare loser at the fifth<br />\nposition, followed with a 3-6,<br />\n4-6 show against Mary Roy.<br />\nTying it up for Swarthmore was<br />\nPam Duke, who nipped the<br />\nJays' Julie North in a marathon<br />\n6-7 (5-7), 7-5 two-setter.<br />\nLast week against Mt. St.<br />\nMary's, the .lays went into<br />\ndoubles play all even and dropped what Coach Kay Fowler<br />\nhad called a \"sure win\" by losing at first and third doubles.
