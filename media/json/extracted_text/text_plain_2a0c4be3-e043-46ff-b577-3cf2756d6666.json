The<br />\nmeeting was one of the most important events on the scientific calendar of the academic year.<br />\nPapers limited to \"short time\"<br />\nwere read, and, while some were of<br />\na very technical style, they were all<br />\nenjoyed by members of the faculty,<br />\nstudents and the general public that<br />\nattended.<br />\nThe academy is composed of one<br />\nhundred and thirty-five specialists in<br />\nscientific work of America and Canada. Dr. William H. Welch, head<br />\nof Hopkins, is president. He was<br />\nrecently elected for a term of five<br />\nyears. The University has ten members: Dr. Abel, pharmacology; Dr.<br />\nAmes, physics; Dr. Clark, geology;<br />\nDr. Howell, physiology; Dr. Mace,<br />\nanatomy; Dr. Morse, chemistry;<br />\nDr. Reid, geology; Dr. Remsen,<br />\nchemistry; Dr. Welch, pathology;<br />\n\u2022 and Dr. Wood, physics.<br />\nAmong the more noted speakers<br />\nwere Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, who<br />\ngave a biographical memoir of Dr.<br />\nJohn S. Billings, the Civil War<br />\nphysician, who later became interested in the establishment of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical School:<br />\nDr. Simon Flexner, formerly of<br />\nHopkins, now of the Rockefeller<br />\nInstitute; Dr. C. B. Davenport,<br />\nhead of the government eugenical<br />\nwork at Cold Spring Harbor; Dr.<br />\nHoward A. Kelly, of Hopkins, who<br />\ntold of his clinic for radium cures;<br />\nDr. Harry Fielding Reid, who spoke<br />\non earthquakes and tidal waves;<br />\nand Dr. Harry C. Jones, who talked<br />\nof light absorption.<br />\nThe complete list of speakers<br />\nfollows:<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting last Friday afternoon the faculty committee announced through the Student Council that all the penalties imposed<br />\non the sophomores for the recent<br />\nhazing episode were to be removed<br />\non Tuesday, November 25. This<br />\naction comes in time to enable the<br />\nsophomores to see the St. John's<br />\ngame, to hold the interclass football game and to attend the first<br />\ncotillon.<br />\nThe four now famous conditions,<br />\nwhich are to be void on Tuesday,<br />\nare:<br />\nFirst\u2014They shall take no part in<br />\nthe exercises of athletic teams and<br />\nmusical clubs.<br />\nSecond\u2014They shall be excluded<br />\nfrom the gymnasium building.<br />\nThird\u2014They shall not be present<br />\nat any game, concert or dance given<br />\nunder the auspices of the students.<br />\nFourth\u2014That the probation shall<br />\ncontinue until February 1.<br />\nTheir issuance caused intense excitement among the undergraduates<br />\nand a mass-meeting was called,<br />\nwhich jammed Hopkins Hall. Redhot speeches were the order of the<br />\nday; many went so far as to urge<br />\na general strike. Shortly after 2<br />\no'clock the cooler heads prevailed<br />\nand the sophomores were assured<br />\nthat if they \"signed\" their fellowstudents would unanimously endeavor to have \"the mild disabilities\" (mirabile dictu!) removed.<br />\nOrganized effort was made to<br />\npresent to the faculty, individually<br />\nand collectively, the student viewpoint. It was soon apparent that<br />\nthe sympathy, which would naturally have been with the authorities if a strike had been declared,<br />\nwas now totally with the students.<br />\nMoreover, it was realized that no<br />\nfurther advantage could be gained<br />\nby the full continuance of the faculty cOnditions.<br />\n<br />\nIt was announced last week by<br />\nthe authorities at Oxford that<br />\nJulian H. Marshall, A.B. '13, and<br />\nCarl J. Weber, '14, have passed<br />\nthe qualifying examinations in<br />\nLatin and mathematics for the<br />\nRhodes Scholarship to be awarded<br />\nthis year for the session beginning<br />\nOctober, 1914.<br />\nMr. Marshall, who received his<br />\nbachelor's degree with the Class<br />\nof 1913, is well known to all Hopkins students as a member of the<br />\nfamous championship lacrosse team<br />\nof 1913. In addition to this, he<br />\nwas a member of the editorial<br />\nboard of THE NEWS-LETTER, assistant manager of the lacrosse<br />\nteam (1910-11, 1911-12), member<br />\nof the Glee Club, and assistant business manager of the Km \"Hullabaloo.\" He is a good all-round<br />\nman.<br />\nMr. Weber, who will be graduated as a bachelor of arts next<br />\nJune, is the president of the Grotins Society. He is also an assistant editor of THE NEws-LETTER, sings first bass in the Glee<br />\nClub, and is a member of the Instrumental Club.<br />\nCharles Leland Getz. '13, is still<br />\nin the competition. Getz was a<br />\nmighty worker while in collerre,<br />\nand has a tremendous list after his<br />\nname in the 1913 year book. He<br />\nran a sharp race for the scholarship last year with Emory Niles.<br />\nBut it is believed that family objections may keep \"Getzie\" from<br />\noffering his name.<br />\nThe winner of the scholarship is<br />\nsure to be a Hopkins man. The<br />\nSelection by the three presidents<br />\nwill be made before Christmas.<br />\n<br />\nOwing to the death of Homer<br />\nWray, one of the members of their<br />\nsquad, the Gettysburg football team<br />\nwas unable to play the game with<br />\nHopkins scheduled for last Saturday. The announcement of this<br />\nfact caused much disappointment<br />\namong the Hopkins rooters, for all<br />\nhad expected to see a well-played<br />\ncontest.<br />\nThe Hopkins football team went<br />\nin a body to Oriole Park to see<br />\nSt. John's play Washington College, in hopes of getting an idea<br />\nof what kind of game St. John's<br />\nmay be expected to put up next<br />\nThursday.<br />\n<br />\nTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2.30 P.

As the defeats<br />\nwere mostly at the hands of such<br />\nteams as Swarthmore and Carlisle,<br />\nwhom Hopkins could not hope to<br />\nbeat, the Hopkins followers do not<br />\nfeel ashamed of the record of their<br />\nteam.

Its resolutions convey the<br />\nspirit and idea of abolishment.<br />\nThey are to be presented to the students, and debate and amendments<br />\nwill be in order. But, however<br />\nfew or many be the changes in the<br />\nresolutions, it is intended that they<br />\nwill finally be adopted, with the idea<br />\nthat undergraduates in the examination rooms will be under a moral<br />\npledge not to receive or furnish<br />\nany assistance.<br />\nThe Council's initiative in this<br />\nmatter is highly commendable. It<br />\nhas, on several other occasions, won<br />\nvictories in the regulation of student affairs, and all of them have<br />\nbeen steps forward in self-government. Its latest plan, that to put<br />\nin practice the honor system, is<br />\nespecially fine in spirit, and it is<br />\nto be hoped that Wednesday's<br />\nmass-meeting will be a notable<br />\ngathering of students demanding<br />\nthe abolishment of all semblances<br />\nof dishonesty and the establishment<br />\nof a high code of student morals.<br />\nWe Sympathize With Gettysburg.<br />\n<br />\nThe entire student body of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is distressed at the news of the death of<br />\nHomer H.

The<br />\nmeeting was one of the most important events on the scientific calendar of the academic year.<br />\nPapers limited to \"short time\"<br />\nwere read, and, while some were of<br />\na very technical style, they were all<br />\nenjoyed by members of the faculty,<br />\nstudents and the general public that<br />\nattended.<br />\nThe academy is composed of one<br />\nhundred and thirty-five specialists in<br />\nscientific work of America and Canada. Dr. William H. Welch, head<br />\nof Hopkins, is president. He was<br />\nrecently elected for a term of five<br />\nyears.

This<br />\naction comes in time to enable the<br />\nsophomores to see the St. John's<br />\ngame, to hold the interclass football game and to attend the first<br />\ncotillon.<br />\nThe four now famous conditions,<br />\nwhich are to be void on Tuesday,<br />\nare:<br />\nFirst\u2014They shall take no part in<br />\nthe exercises of athletic teams and<br />\nmusical clubs.<br />\nSecond\u2014They shall be excluded<br />\nfrom the gymnasium building.<br />\nThird\u2014They shall not be present<br />\nat any game, concert or dance given<br />\nunder the auspices of the students.<br />\nFourth\u2014That the probation shall<br />\ncontinue until February 1.<br />\nTheir issuance caused intense excitement among the undergraduates<br />\nand a mass-meeting was called,<br />\nwhich jammed Hopkins Hall. Redhot speeches were the order of the<br />\nday; many went so far as to urge<br />\na general strike. Shortly after 2<br />\no'clock the cooler heads prevailed<br />\nand the sophomores were assured<br />\nthat if they \"signed\" their fellowstudents would unanimously endeavor to have \"the mild disabilities\" (mirabile dictu!) removed.<br />\nOrganized effort was made to<br />\npresent to the faculty, individually<br />\nand collectively, the student viewpoint. It was soon apparent that<br />\nthe sympathy, which would naturally have been with the authorities if a strike had been declared,<br />\nwas now totally with the students.<br />\nMoreover, it was realized that no<br />\nfurther advantage could be gained<br />\nby the full continuance of the faculty cOnditions.<br /><br />\nIt was announced last week by<br />\nthe authorities at Oxford that<br />\nJulian H.

In addition to this, he<br />\nwas a member of the editorial<br />\nboard of THE NEWS-LETTER, assistant manager of the lacrosse<br />\nteam (1910-11, 1911-12), member<br />\nof the Glee Club, and assistant business manager of the Km \"Hullabaloo.\" He is a good all-round<br />\nman.<br />\nMr. Weber, who will be graduated as a bachelor of arts next<br />\nJune, is the president of the Grotins Society.

Its resolutions convey the<br />\nspirit and idea of abolishment.<br />\nThey are to be presented to the students, and debate and amendments<br />\nwill be in order. But, however<br />\nfew or many be the changes in the<br />\nresolutions, it is intended that they<br />\nwill finally be adopted, with the idea<br />\nthat undergraduates in the examination rooms will be under a moral<br />\npledge not to receive or furnish<br />\nany assistance.<br />\nThe Council's initiative in this<br />\nmatter is highly commendable. It<br />\nhas, on several other occasions, won<br />\nvictories in the regulation of student affairs, and all of them have<br />\nbeen steps forward in self-government. Its latest plan, that to put<br />\nin practice the honor system, is<br />\nespecially fine in spirit, and it is<br />\nto be hoped that Wednesday's<br />\nmass-meeting will be a notable<br />\ngathering of students demanding<br />\nthe abolishment of all semblances<br />\nof dishonesty and the establishment<br />\nof a high code of student morals.<br />\nWe Sympathize With Gettysburg.<br /><br />\nThe entire student body of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is distressed at the news of the death of<br />\nHomer H. Wray, of the Gettysburg football squad.<br />\nHopkins knows how the Soldiers<br />\nfeel now that one of their men has<br />\nfallen on the field, a martyr to football.
