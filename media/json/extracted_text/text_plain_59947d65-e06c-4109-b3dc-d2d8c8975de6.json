The freshmen<br />\ndeserve full recognition Of their attainments, and, if they are to develop into good Hopkins upperclassmen, they should be encouraged<br />\nto continue the efficient expenditure<br />\nof their efforts which they have<br />\nshown themselves capable of handling. With that idea in mind, THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER desires to express its<br />\nhope that nothing of the spirit of<br />\nthe freshmen will be lost and that<br />\nmuch will be gained by them to<br />\nthe benefit of Johns Hopkins during<br />\nthe four years in which it will be<br />\ntheir,privilege to be joined together<br />\nas a class.<br />\nIt is too often the case that these<br />\nfour years prove too a short a time<br />\nfor a class to perfect an acceptable<br />\norganization. Most classes succeed<br />\nin working together as a unit by the<br />\nJanuary of their freshman year,<br />\nbut too many lose the organization<br />\nafter the cessation of activities of<br />\ntheir sophomore year. Some never<br />\nget together to produce good results; others get together, stay together and make their four years<br />\noi college a joy to themselves and<br />\na period of prosperity for the University. Which type are the two<br />\nunder-classes of today going to fol\u2022<br />\nlow?<br />\n<br />\nIt is almost needless to point out<br />\nthat organization is always a necessary foundation.for successful class<br />\nwork; it is not needless, however,<br />\nfor some classes to be prodded<br />\nalong in their loose and lazy habits<br />\nof taking up matters of importance.<br />\nIt is the opinion of THE NEwsLETTER that classes at Hopkins are<br />\npi one to lose whatever organization<br />\nthey may have effected as freshmen<br />\nand sophomores before they enter<br />\ninto their last year of college, life.<br />\nFreshmen and sophomores of today<br />\nshould take heed that they do not<br />\nlose spirit from now on, or allow<br />\nthemselves to suffer a reaction.<br />\nSteady progress is that which produces results. Spasmodic outbursts<br />\nof enthusiasm and ability can or<br />\nthemselves avail little.<br />\nThat internal organization is\"<br />\nnecessary in class work after the<br />\nstrenuous rivalry of freshmansophomore days are over is demonstrated yearly by the spectacle of<br />\nthe senior class working to finance<br />\nand edit its Hullabaloo. If we examine the condition of classes at<br />\nthis stage of their existence, we see<br />\nimmediately the effect of the presence or absence of well-founded organization. Its absence is the root<br />\nof needless worry and work on the<br />\npart of class officers; its presence<br />\nis the cause of every success. And,<br />\nabove all, it cannot be well matured<br />\nin the senior year if there has been<br />\na lack of spirit for any length of<br />\ntime, or if organization itself was<br />\nnever completed.<br />\nWhat the classes of 1918 and<br />\n1919 are going to do in this matter<br />\nremains to be seen. What they<br />\nshould do has been pointed out; if<br />\nthey do it, they will experience a<br />\nhealthy existence throughout their<br />\ncollege career; if not, they are almost certain to have serious trouble.<br />\nGet together, systematize, and carry<br />\nout your system!<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\nMonday, January 24<br />\n<br />\n3.00 P.

The glee and mandolin clubs<br />\nheld several successful rehearsals,<br />\nwith the result that the affairs of<br />\nthe clubs are in much better shape<br />\nthan those of any club of the past<br />\nfew years. As a consequence of<br />\nsuch favorable conditions, little<br />\nwork remains to be done before<br />\nthe clubs will be able to start their<br />\nschedule with confidence and success.<br />\nThe repertoire of the glee club<br />\nwill be unusually large this year,<br />\nand is composed of selections of<br />\nmost varied character. Particular<br />\ncare has been taken by the director<br />\nin selecting the songs for the vocalists, and the task of choosing those<br />\nselections which will appear on the<br />\nprogram and those which will be<br />\nused as encores will be a difficult<br />\none. In general, the repertoire and<br />\nthe unusual ability of this season's<br />\nclub promises to surpass the high<br />\nstandard set by last year's organization.<br />\nThe progress of the mandolin<br />\nclub, although less marked than that<br />\nof the glee club, due to the fact that<br />\nseveral of the instrumentalists attend classes at Homewood, has been<br />\nvery encouraging. The mandolin<br />\nclub is composed entirely of stringed<br />\ninstruments, with the exception of<br />\nthe traps. This is something of a<br />\ndeparture from the \"instrumental\"<br />\nclub of past years, hence the change<br />\nin name. The repertoire of the<br />\nmandolin club offers numbers just<br />\nas well selected and varied as those<br />\nof the glee club. The better class<br />\nof music will appear on the program, while the \"rags\" will be retained to serve as encores.<br />\nThe quartet, composed of Messrs.<br />\nSwartz, Spieker, Houghton and<br />\nFlack, has been rehearsing regularly and promises to have several<br />\nnumbers a little different from those<br />\noffered in past years.<br />\nThe complete schedule of concerts will be announced shortly.<br />\nSeveral dates have yet to be decided upon and arrangements for<br />\nseveral trips are still pending. The<br />\nschedule committee will present its<br />\nreport to the board for approval<br />\nas soon as these details are settled.<br />\nAll efforts are being concentrated<br />\non the McCoy Hall concert, which<br />\nis to be given on Friday evening,<br />\nFebruary 25. In past years this<br />\nconcert has always been characterized by a very small number of undergraduate students in attendance.<br />\nThis condition has been a matter of<br />\ngreat concern to the members of<br />\nthe present board, inasmuch as the<br />\nMusical Clubs are composed almost<br />\nentirely of undergraduate students<br />\nand ought to arouse interest among<br />\ntheir .fellows. As a possible solution of this problem, a special ticket,<br />\nexchangeable for two reserved seat3,<br />\n<br />\nThe Senior Class scored a great<br />\nsuccess in their Hullabaloo benefit,<br />\nheld at Ford's last Friday night.<br />\nBesides seeing a most excellent play<br />\nadmirably acted, the Hopkins supporters who were present were all<br />\nthe more pleased because of the fact<br />\nthat the seniors had disposed of<br />\ntwo hundred and ninety dollars'<br />\nworth of tickets, half of which is<br />\nclear profit for the Hullabaloo. The<br />\ncommittee has not as yet heard<br />\nfrom all those who sold tickets for<br />\nthe benefit, and there is a possibility<br />\nthat more money will be coming<br />\ninto the class treasury.<br />\nThe benefit committee was singularly , fortunate in being able to se'?<br />\ncure such a play as \"Rolling Stones<br />\nfor the benefit. The characters<br />\nwere so natural and true to life,<br />\neven in unnatural and unusual circumstances, that the audience was<br />\nsoon lost to everything else in its<br />\ninterest in the play. \"Rolling<br />\nStones\" has been described verT,<br />\nrightly as a \"comedy of adventure.\"<br />\nThere was plenty of comedy, and<br />\nalso plenty of adventure. Every<br />\ncomic part had a background of adventure and every adventure was<br />\nfilled with comedy.<br />\nCharles Ruggles and Harrison<br />\nFord took the parts of the \"rolling<br />\nstones,\" and gave the audience as<br />\nclever and realistic a representation<br />\nof the two adventurous youths as<br />\nanyone could possible give. All<br />\nthose in the cast were of exceptional<br />\nability and were eminently fitted to<br />\ntheir parts.<br />\nThe success of the seniors in disposing of so many of their tickets<br />\nwill materially aid the Hullabaloo<br />\neditors in their efforts to produce<br />\na good year-book. Every year the<br />\npublishers of the Hullabaloo have<br />\ndifficulty in raising the funds necessary for the expenses of printing<br />\nthe book, and the support given the<br />\nClass of '16 was gratifying n6t only<br />\nto the seniors, but to everyone interested in Hopkin's affairs. There<br />\nwas a larger attendance at Friday<br />\nnight's performance than has ever<br />\nbefore been seen at a Hopkins benefit, and this, together with the fact<br />\nthat the play was most enjoyable,<br />\nmarks this event as a most decided<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nwill be offered to undergraduate<br />\nstudents at the reduced rate of<br />\n$1.50. Only one of these tickets<br />\nwill be allowed each student. Additional tickets must be obtained at<br />\nthe regular rate of $1.00 admission.<br />\nAll seats will be reserved.<br />\nArrangements have been made<br />\nto have the usual dance follow the<br />\nconcert. The management feels<br />\nfortunate in being able to announce<br />\nthat the renowned Louis Fisher will<br />\nbe on hand with three of his musicians to furnish the dance music.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, JANUARY 24, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nAMUSEMENTS<br />\n<br />\nFord's<br />\n<br />\nTonight at 8.15<br />\nAuto Cars, 10.45<br />\n<br />\nMatinees Wed. and Sat., 25c to $1.50<br />\nEvenings, 25c to $2.00<br />\nDavid Belasco Presents<br />\n<br />\nFRANCES STARR<br />\nin the Most Widely Discussed Play<br />\nof the Year<br />\n<br />\nMARIE - ODILE<br />\nNext Week\u2014It Pays to Advertise<br />\n<br />\nGARDE<br />\nADVANCED VAUDEVILLE<br />\nA Speedy Musical Comedy<br />\n<br />\nPULLMAN PORTER MAIDS<br />\nFeaturing SAM HARRIS and his<br />\n10\u2014WINSOME MAIDS-10<br />\n7\u2014Other Big Acts-7<br />\n<br />\nDancing in the Garden Ballroom<br />\nDancing- Tauglit, $1 per Month<br />\nAdmission to the Ballroom and Dance Floor:<br />\nGentlemen, 25c; Ladies, 15c.

The freshmen<br />\ndeserve full recognition Of their attainments, and, if they are to develop into good Hopkins upperclassmen, they should be encouraged<br />\nto continue the efficient expenditure<br />\nof their efforts which they have<br />\nshown themselves capable of handling. With that idea in mind, THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER desires to express its<br />\nhope that nothing of the spirit of<br />\nthe freshmen will be lost and that<br />\nmuch will be gained by them to<br />\nthe benefit of Johns Hopkins during<br />\nthe four years in which it will be<br />\ntheir,privilege to be joined together<br />\nas a class.<br />\nIt is too often the case that these<br />\nfour years prove too a short a time<br />\nfor a class to perfect an acceptable<br />\norganization. Most classes succeed<br />\nin working together as a unit by the<br />\nJanuary of their freshman year,<br />\nbut too many lose the organization<br />\nafter the cessation of activities of<br />\ntheir sophomore year. Some never<br />\nget together to produce good results; others get together, stay together and make their four years<br />\noi college a joy to themselves and<br />\na period of prosperity for the University. Which type are the two<br />\nunder-classes of today going to fol\u2022<br />\nlow?<br /><br />\nIt is almost needless to point out<br />\nthat organization is always a necessary foundation.for successful class<br />\nwork; it is not needless, however,<br />\nfor some classes to be prodded<br />\nalong in their loose and lazy habits<br />\nof taking up matters of importance.<br />\nIt is the opinion of THE NEwsLETTER that classes at Hopkins are<br />\npi one to lose whatever organization<br />\nthey may have effected as freshmen<br />\nand sophomores before they enter<br />\ninto their last year of college, life.<br />\nFreshmen and sophomores of today<br />\nshould take heed that they do not<br />\nlose spirit from now on, or allow<br />\nthemselves to suffer a reaction.<br />\nSteady progress is that which produces results. Spasmodic outbursts<br />\nof enthusiasm and ability can or<br />\nthemselves avail little.<br />\nThat internal organization is\"<br />\nnecessary in class work after the<br />\nstrenuous rivalry of freshmansophomore days are over is demonstrated yearly by the spectacle of<br />\nthe senior class working to finance<br />\nand edit its Hullabaloo. If we examine the condition of classes at<br />\nthis stage of their existence, we see<br />\nimmediately the effect of the presence or absence of well-founded organization. Its absence is the root<br />\nof needless worry and work on the<br />\npart of class officers; its presence<br />\nis the cause of every success. And,<br />\nabove all, it cannot be well matured<br />\nin the senior year if there has been<br />\na lack of spirit for any length of<br />\ntime, or if organization itself was<br />\nnever completed.<br />\nWhat the classes of 1918 and<br />\n1919 are going to do in this matter<br />\nremains to be seen. What they<br />\nshould do has been pointed out; if<br />\nthey do it, they will experience a<br />\nhealthy existence throughout their<br />\ncollege career; if not, they are almost certain to have serious trouble.<br />\nGet together, systematize, and carry<br />\nout your system!<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\nMonday, January 24<br /><br />\n3.00 P.

The glee and mandolin clubs<br />\nheld several successful rehearsals,<br />\nwith the result that the affairs of<br />\nthe clubs are in much better shape<br />\nthan those of any club of the past<br />\nfew years. As a consequence of<br />\nsuch favorable conditions, little<br />\nwork remains to be done before<br />\nthe clubs will be able to start their<br />\nschedule with confidence and success.<br />\nThe repertoire of the glee club<br />\nwill be unusually large this year,<br />\nand is composed of selections of<br />\nmost varied character. Particular<br />\ncare has been taken by the director<br />\nin selecting the songs for the vocalists, and the task of choosing those<br />\nselections which will appear on the<br />\nprogram and those which will be<br />\nused as encores will be a difficult<br />\none. In general, the repertoire and<br />\nthe unusual ability of this season's<br />\nclub promises to surpass the high<br />\nstandard set by last year's organization.<br />\nThe progress of the mandolin<br />\nclub, although less marked than that<br />\nof the glee club, due to the fact that<br />\nseveral of the instrumentalists attend classes at Homewood, has been<br />\nvery encouraging. The mandolin<br />\nclub is composed entirely of stringed<br />\ninstruments, with the exception of<br />\nthe traps. This is something of a<br />\ndeparture from the \"instrumental\"<br />\nclub of past years, hence the change<br />\nin name. The repertoire of the<br />\nmandolin club offers numbers just<br />\nas well selected and varied as those<br />\nof the glee club. The better class<br />\nof music will appear on the program, while the \"rags\" will be retained to serve as encores.<br />\nThe quartet, composed of Messrs.<br />\nSwartz, Spieker, Houghton and<br />\nFlack, has been rehearsing regularly and promises to have several<br />\nnumbers a little different from those<br />\noffered in past years.<br />\nThe complete schedule of concerts will be announced shortly.<br />\nSeveral dates have yet to be decided upon and arrangements for<br />\nseveral trips are still pending. The<br />\nschedule committee will present its<br />\nreport to the board for approval<br />\nas soon as these details are settled.<br />\nAll efforts are being concentrated<br />\non the McCoy Hall concert, which<br />\nis to be given on Friday evening,<br />\nFebruary 25. In past years this<br />\nconcert has always been characterized by a very small number of undergraduate students in attendance.<br />\nThis condition has been a matter of<br />\ngreat concern to the members of<br />\nthe present board, inasmuch as the<br />\nMusical Clubs are composed almost<br />\nentirely of undergraduate students<br />\nand ought to arouse interest among<br />\ntheir .fellows. As a possible solution of this problem, a special ticket,<br />\nexchangeable for two reserved seat3,<br /><br />\nThe Senior Class scored a great<br />\nsuccess in their Hullabaloo benefit,<br />\nheld at Ford's last Friday night.<br />\nBesides seeing a most excellent play<br />\nadmirably acted, the Hopkins supporters who were present were all<br />\nthe more pleased because of the fact<br />\nthat the seniors had disposed of<br />\ntwo hundred and ninety dollars'<br />\nworth of tickets, half of which is<br />\nclear profit for the Hullabaloo. The<br />\ncommittee has not as yet heard<br />\nfrom all those who sold tickets for<br />\nthe benefit, and there is a possibility<br />\nthat more money will be coming<br />\ninto the class treasury.<br />\nThe benefit committee was singularly , fortunate in being able to se'?<br />\ncure such a play as \"Rolling Stones<br />\nfor the benefit. The characters<br />\nwere so natural and true to life,<br />\neven in unnatural and unusual circumstances, that the audience was<br />\nsoon lost to everything else in its<br />\ninterest in the play. \"Rolling<br />\nStones\" has been described verT,<br />\nrightly as a \"comedy of adventure.\"<br />\nThere was plenty of comedy, and<br />\nalso plenty of adventure. Every<br />\ncomic part had a background of adventure and every adventure was<br />\nfilled with comedy.<br />\nCharles Ruggles and Harrison<br />\nFord took the parts of the \"rolling<br />\nstones,\" and gave the audience as<br />\nclever and realistic a representation<br />\nof the two adventurous youths as<br />\nanyone could possible give. All<br />\nthose in the cast were of exceptional<br />\nability and were eminently fitted to<br />\ntheir parts.<br />\nThe success of the seniors in disposing of so many of their tickets<br />\nwill materially aid the Hullabaloo<br />\neditors in their efforts to produce<br />\na good year-book. Every year the<br />\npublishers of the Hullabaloo have<br />\ndifficulty in raising the funds necessary for the expenses of printing<br />\nthe book, and the support given the<br />\nClass of '16 was gratifying n6t only<br />\nto the seniors, but to everyone interested in Hopkin's affairs. There<br />\nwas a larger attendance at Friday<br />\nnight's performance than has ever<br />\nbefore been seen at a Hopkins benefit, and this, together with the fact<br />\nthat the play was most enjoyable,<br />\nmarks this event as a most decided<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nwill be offered to undergraduate<br />\nstudents at the reduced rate of<br />\n$1.50. Only one of these tickets<br />\nwill be allowed each student. Additional tickets must be obtained at<br />\nthe regular rate of $1.00 admission.<br />\nAll seats will be reserved.<br />\nArrangements have been made<br />\nto have the usual dance follow the<br />\nconcert. The management feels<br />\nfortunate in being able to announce<br />\nthat the renowned Louis Fisher will<br />\nbe on hand with three of his musicians to furnish the dance music.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, JANUARY 24, 1916.<br /><br />\nAMUSEMENTS<br /><br />\nFord's<br /><br />\nTonight at 8.15<br />\nAuto Cars, 10.45<br /><br />\nMatinees Wed. and Sat., 25c to $1.50<br />\nEvenings, 25c to $2.00<br />\nDavid Belasco Presents<br /><br />\nFRANCES STARR<br />\nin the Most Widely Discussed Play<br />\nof the Year<br /><br />\nMARIE - ODILE<br />\nNext Week\u2014It Pays to Advertise<br /><br />\nGARDE<br />\nADVANCED VAUDEVILLE<br />\nA Speedy Musical Comedy<br /><br />\nPULLMAN PORTER MAIDS<br />\nFeaturing SAM HARRIS and his<br />\n10\u2014WINSOME MAIDS-10<br />\n7\u2014Other Big Acts-7<br /><br />\nDancing in the Garden Ballroom<br />\nDancing- Tauglit, $1 per Month<br />\nAdmission to the Ballroom and Dance Floor:<br />\nGentlemen, 25c; Ladies, 15c.
