But the admissions<br />\nprocess is what really determines whether you have a hit<br />\nor a turkey on your hands. Now what I've proposed to El<br />\n<br />\nPresidente is this. Stevie Baby, I said, we set up a,<br />\nthree-member celebrity admissions panel and each student<br />\nact will be auditioned and ranked from ()lie to ten-unless, after fo 45 seconds, any member of the panel<br />\ndecides that the student has no talent.<br />\nN-L: What happens then?<br />\nBarris: Hah Hah!

But that's what our audience<br />\nlikes.<br />\nN-L: Do you plan to televise these proceedings?<br />\nBarris: You bet your bong we do! I'm in business. I call it<br />\nthe \"open admissions\" game. I've taken every function of<br />\nlife and put it on the tube. I created the Dating Game, the<br />\nNewlywed Game, I gave George Carlin the idea for the<br />\nDivorce Game. Why not the Admissions Game?

Maybe<br />\nVince Bagli, Wally Orlinsky, and Barbara Mikulski to<br />\nstart.<br />\nN-L: There's more to your job than admissions, In fact, in<br />\nthe past, admissions did not even come under your<br />\nposition. You're supposed to be advising and counseling.<br />\nBarris: Well, I did advise one former News-Letter editor<br />\nwho thinks he can write. Bob, I said, there's a bus leaving<br />\nfor Missouri in five minutes. Be under it.

It is with a noble heart<br />\nthat the United States and other signers of the 1967<br />\nTreaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Arms, are<br />\nwilling to take full responsibility for deciding this issue for,<br />\nthe rest of the countries of the world. The question at this<br />\ndate is not who shall possess a bomb, but why should the<br />\nU.S., under the provisions of President Carter's new<br />\nproposals to Congress, impose ineffective sanctions on<br />\nother countries that choose to sell nuclear technology?<br />\nThe President's newest proposals would give him the<br />\npower to sanction countries that do not comply with U.S.'<br />\nguidelines on dissemination (by with-holding fuel for<br />\nnuclear reactors). But the fact that West Germany and<br />\nFrance among others do not agree with Carter poses<br />\nseveral problems. These countries argue that the sale of<br />\nnuclear reactors and reprocessing plants is a major<br />\nelement of their present and future export trade<br />\nConsidering this position, .Carter should rpore carefully<br />\nweigh the effectiveness of his approach to the problem of<br />\nnuclear proliferation.<br />\nIt is a fact that many nations desire the knowledge and<br />\nmeans to produce nuclear weapons and it is also true that<br />\nwe cannot prevent these countries from acquiring the<br />\nbomb in the future. One by one, technicians in<br />\nunderdeveloped countries are discovering the secrets of<br />\nthe atom for themselves and with or without our<br />\napproval, me numner ot nuclear powers will continue to<br />\ngrow. Simply stalling the rate at which nations arel<br />\nacquiring the bomb does not solve the problem. The \"Say the secret woid and win anatom boilib.<br />\npossibility of atomic warfare is a recurring nightmare that,<br />\nmust be realistically dealt with; if Jimmy Carter wants to<br />\nsomething you see everyday<br />\nfree us of this spectre, he must attack the roots of<br />\n<br />\n--)<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n\u2018<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n.1.><br />\n<br />\nP<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n\u2022<br />\nir<br />\n\u2022f 1 v<br />\n//\u2022ff<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n74<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nq ?,f461<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n-4\\114<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n\u2022\u201e<br />\n<br />\nnot allow us to return to this ideal) and secondly, if every<br />\nnation had the bomb. Before the horror of this possibility<br />\nclouds the rational thought process, consider what a<br />\npowerful deterent the universal possession of the bomb<br />\nwould be. Any nation that would dare to employ the<br />\nbomb against any other would be guaranteed total<br />\ndestruction. Actually, the idea is not as ridiculous as it<br />\nfirst appears, the mutual knowledge that both the U.S.<br />\nand the U.S.S.R.. wield weapons powerful enough to<br />\nannihalate tifeir populations, cities, in 1-rort everything of<br />\nvalue, has kept them from ever using them. (Or should<br />\nwe attribute our restraint to our more 'civilized' nature?)<br />\nThere is every reason to believe another nation faced with<br />\nthe consequences of nuclear war would as well be<br />\ndeterred. It is only the case in whic imbalance exists that<br />\na leader would be tempted to use the bomb.<br />\nBut however unlikely the first scenario may be and as<br />\nimminent as is the second, the point is that President<br />\nCarter undoubtedly harbors good intentions in trying to<br />\navert nuclear war by calling for agreement on<br />\nnon-proliferation, but his methods are doomed to failure.<br />\nHis choice of \"the establishment of common international<br />\nsanctions\" will not only fail to prevent the spread of<br />\nnuclear capability, but as he admits, it will 'adversely<br />\naffect certain allies whose cooperation is needed if we re<br />\nto achieve our ultimate obtctive of non-proliferation.\"<br />\nOstensibly, Mr. Carter is wL.1ng to risk the animosity of<br />\nour allies so that he can achieve his goal of short-term<br />\nnon-proliferation.<br />\nThose not possessing the bomb want it and whether<br />\nthey develop it themselves or acquire the technology<br />\nelsewhere does not matter; the result will be the same.<br />\nNon-proliferation does not dissolve the spectre of nuclear<br />\nholocaust, it only defines who will have the honor of<br />\ntaking art in the deadly game. Nobody wants a nuclear<br />\nwar, but sanctioning those countries, often our West<br />\n;propean allies that choose not to abide by our policy of<br />\nton-proliferation, is not only failing to stop the spread<br />\nf- -.nuclear capability, but is also creating avoidable<br />\nresentment and strain in our relations.<br />\n<br />\n,\u2022'.<br />\n,<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nI.<br />\n4,.\\<br />\n<br />\nny<br />\n<br />\n(I<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1.....1,0 \u00b0,,v.\u201e,r<br />\nth<br />\n<br />\n\fmay 3, 1977/news-letter/page 3<br />\n<br />\nForeign language requirement to return?<br />\nBy'GAYLE COHEN<br />\nAll Bachelor of Arts degree candidates could be<br />\nrequired to study a foreign language through the<br />\nintertnediate,level, according to a proposal,. the Academic<br />\nCouncil will consider tomorrow night\u2014The proposal,<br />\nwhich informed sources predict will almost certainly pass,<br />\nmay be the first step in a series of course requirement<br />\nchanges.<br />\n\"There are clearly a number of things about the<br />\ncurriculum that we are interested in looking into. There<br />\nshould be a coupling of this requirement with a concerted<br />\nlook at the general goals of the education of<br />\nundergraduates,\" Dean of Undergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudies Sigmund R. Suskind said. Ther proposal was<br />\nsubmitted by the Committee on Underbraduate Studies in<br />\nresponse to faoulty complaints of student illiteracy. CUS<br />\nis a subcommittee of the Academic Council which is<br />\ncomposed of five faculty and four student<br />\nmembers. \"We are constantly getting complaints from<br />\nfaculty members that students cannot write papers and<br />\nthat they c annot sit in a class and communicate their<br />\nideas clearly,\" said CUS member Charles<br />\nHenderson.<br />\nThe University dropped its foreign language<br />\nrequirement in 1968, leaving the establishment of<br />\nlanguage requirements to individual academic<br />\ndepartments. CUS member Alfredo Holt would like to<br />\nsee this arrangement maintained. \"I would prefer to have<br />\nit as it is now, wher the departments themselves set the<br />\nrequirements. I have doubts about the proposal. Certain<br />\ndisciplines do not demand it.\" He cited American political<br />\nsciences as an area that does not require knowledge of a<br />\n<br />\nforeign language, and mentioned that some students, such<br />\nas history of art majors, need only a specialized<br />\nvocabulary.<br />\nThe department of political economy<br />\nbecame the most recent department to omit compulsory<br />\nlanguage study when it dropped the language requirement<br />\nfor economics majors this year. \"We felt that a foreign<br />\nlanguage was not really required for undergraduate study.<br />\nThe main articles in basic theory are written in English,\"<br />\nDepartment Chairman Peter Newman said. He said he<br />\nwould perfer not to use his department to enforce a<br />\nlanguage requirement, granting the imposition of such a<br />\nrequirement to the University.<br />\nCharles Henderson, who<br />\nvoted in favor of the mandatory language study, said, \"I<br />\ndon't think it's unreasonable that students should be<br />\nconversant in a foreign language.\" He suggested that<br />\nadvisors from individual departments direct students to<br />\nenroll in non-required, but useful, courses.<br />\n\"I was<br />\nunder the general impression that neither the English or<br />\nWriting Seminars department was prepared to undertake a<br />\nlanguage skills development program, but I'd like to see a<br />\nbasic writing course/offered.\" He mentioned that by<br />\nstudying a foreign language, students will learn at least the<br />\nrudiments of grammar.<br />\nNo Guidelines<br />\nAs submitted to the Academic<br />\nCouncil, the CUS proposal lacks clear administrative<br />\nguidelines. It has no provisions for exempting students<br />\nthrough their performance on tests. It also fails to take<br />\ninto account possible growth in the language departments<br />\nand- increased use of language laboratory facilities.<br />\n<br />\nLimits planned for Hopkins- Peabody co-op<br />\nBy ROBERT RIGGS<br />\nUnder a dozen Johns Hopkins students will be<br />\npermitted to take courses at Peabody in September under<br />\nan \"informal agreement,\" according to Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate and Graduate Studies Sigmund R.<br />\nSuskind. In conjunction with Associate Dean of- the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory Tinka Knopf, Suskind has worked<br />\nout an \"unofficial mechanism\" for allowing Hopkins<br />\nstudents to enroll in undergraduate courses at Peabody,<br />\nand Peabody undergraduates to take courses at<br />\nHopkins. Selection of this small group of students will<br />\ntake place in the near future on a \"strictly individual<br />\nbasis,\" according to Suskind. Private instrumental lessons<br />\nwill not be available, but these students will be able to<br />\ntake music area courses such as Theory and History of<br />\nMusic, if they have enough background to pass a<br />\nplacement test. No additional tuition will be charged,<br />\nSuskind said.<br />\nThe exchange remains a \"non-program.\" Suskind<br />\nemphasized, until a formal academic affiliation can be<br />\nworked out. An administrative affiliation between the the<br />\n<br />\ntwo institutions will go into effect July 1, 1977. An<br />\nacademic affiliation would have to be be approved by the<br />\nCommittee for Undergraduate Studies and the Academic<br />\nCouncil, and probably will not be finalized until<br />\nSeptember, 1978, according to Suskind., \"There is no<br />\nagreement yet,\" he said, \"this arrangement will just give<br />\nus some idea of how things will work on a larger scale. It<br />\nhas been done and mutually set up between the two deans<br />\nto let the interested students involved get a chance to take<br />\nsome courses at the other school. It is not a formal<br />\nprogram.\" For this reason, Suskind continued, the<br />\nnumber of students involved must be kept small. \"Under<br />\na dozen\" will be selected from Hopkins, on the basis of<br />\n\"interest, relevance to programs, and ability.\" They will<br />\nbe first-rate students, and they will have to have a clear<br />\nreason why they should<br />\ntake courses at Peabody,\"<br />\nSuskind commented. Dean Knopf stated that \"a limited<br />\nnumber\" of Peabody students will be allowed to<br />\nenroll in courses at Hopkins. Thus far, only four of seven<br />\ncandidates have been selected. The criteria for Peabody<br />\nstudents to take courses at Hopkins, according to Knopf,<br />\nare combined scored of at least 1150-1?00 on the<br />\n<br />\nScholastic Aptitude Test and a \"demonstrated grade<br />\nrecord\" at Peabody. The main course areas in which they<br />\nhave shown interest are the Classics and Russian.<br />\nKnopf predicts the number of Peabody students<br />\npermitted to take courses at Hopkins will rise in future<br />\nyears. \"We want to see how it works out first. As we<br />\ngrow, obviously more exchange possibilities will become<br />\navailable.\" She noted that Peabody students are limited<br />\nby the rigid five-day class scheduling there, which makes<br />\nthe trip to Hopkins very difficult for many students.<br />\nFuture attendance of Hopkins studentsin Peabody<br />\nclasses an academic affiliation will be limited, Knopf<br />\nstated, by placement examinations and available space.<br />\nThere are about 350 undergraduates at Peabody, so any<br />\nmajor influx of Hopkins students could seriously damage<br />\nacademic opportunities for Peabody students. \"I've<br />\nalready had numerous phone calls from Hopkins students<br />\nwho have expressed desire to come her,\" Knopf<br />\ncontinued. \"The faculty has been fascinated by the<br />\npossibility of having Hopkins students come down here.

Dante.<br />\n<br />\nsports editor<br />\nDavid Kraus<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\nJennifer Bishop<br />\n<br />\nBy THOMAS DAHLBERG<br />\nMany different sexual statuses have \"come out of thL,<br />\ncloset\" these days. The male homosexuals have come out,<br />\nand the lesbians, and promiscuity is beginning to take on<br />\nthe guise of normality. There is alot of talk about the<br />\nmale homosexuals \"rights\", some talk about lesbian<br />\n\"rights\" and there's still a little talk left (it's rarely found<br />\ndefensively necessary these days) about the \"right\" to<br />\nlet around\" without the repression of traditional<br />\n\"mores.\" Of course these \"rights\", though sometimes<br />\npolitical in the case of male homosexuals and lesbians, are<br />\noften just social \"rights\"\u2014i.e., the word \"right\" is used<br />\nloosely within contexts where what the male homosexual,<br />\nor the lesbian, or the \"sexually active\" are actually<br />\npleading for is a society where they can be what they are<br />\ncomfortably, without a sense of social failure and<br />\noppression. Gays, for example, claim that there are social<br />\nproblems attached to being gay which are extremely<br />\nimportant to them no matter how petty they seem to<br />\nothers. They plead for a destigmatized status which will<br />\nmake normal socializing possible for them. O.K. Fine. It's<br />\nall pouring \"out of the closet\" 'cause we're all nice<br />\nliberals and we done opened the door wide. And now,<br />\ndarnmit, at the end of the flood, come the virgins.<br />\nThat's right, the virgins gotta get out of the closet and<br />\ninto the streets. They have been socially disenfranchised<br />\nand they have to start fighting for their (social) \"rights.\"<br />\nMost of the following holds true for non-virgins who,<br />\nalong with many virgins, do not care for presumptuous<br />\nsocial pressure. I will discuss virgins almost exclusively<br />\nbecause I wish to dispel certain myths that surround them<br />\nin particular. The problem from a gregarious, fun-loving<br />\nvirgin's point of view is that many of the people who,<br />\nscrew are making normal socializing impossible for<br />\nhim/her. There are still plenty of women out there, for<br />\nexample, who would love to go out with alot of different<br />\nmen, have a good time talking to them, and go home to<br />\ntheir own bed sans date. Some of them are the most<br />\nparanoid people alive these days. They're getting glares<br />\nwhen they close the door leaving him on the outside,<br />\nreputation as a real bitch, and sometimes they actually get<br />\ncussed out. They don't know if they can accept an<br />\ninvitation or not anymore because they are all too often<br />\nput under pressures that they may actually consider<br />\nvulgar. They meet someone new and they don't know<br />\nwhat to think. \"Does he want to make it? Will he put the<br />\npressure on? Should I take a chance and go out with<br />\nhim?\" And since she's had too many bad experiences<br />\nalready she says \"no\"\u2014possibly to someone with perfect<br />\nmanners.<br />\n<br />\nAnd that brings us to the problem from a male virgin's ,<br />\npoint of view. Not only does he resent the assumptions;<br />\nand presumptions of the women who use men just a:.;<br />\nreadily as men use women, he may not be able to mak.\u20ac<br />\ncontact with the girls he'd really like to know because<br />\nthey may be operating on the assumption that he's just<br />\nanother horny bore. (They may consider this statistically<br />\nprobable in the light of their experience.) The virgin lives<br />\nin a youth culture that always has him/her guessing and<br />\nsecond-guessing about what his date or acquaintance<br />\n<br />\nVirgin's rights:<br />\n<br />\nCome out of the closet<br />\nexpects. The trouble isn't necessarily that virgins feel<br />\ncompelled to do what they don't want to do; if they're<br />\nvirgins today they're probably too strong to be serviously<br />\nbothered by the pressures\u2014they just tell whomever it is<br />\nthat they can bloody well go to hell. The trouble is that a<br />\nvirgin may want to socialize normally with members of<br />\nthe opposite sex (or whomever) who do hit the sack; they<br />\ncan handle the pressure these people may implicitly or<br />\nexplicitly apply, they just don't want to be bothered by<br />\nit.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the social difficulties attached to being a virgin<br />\nresides in the fact that there are all kinds of myths<br />\nsurrounding virginity (just like there are all kinds of<br />\nmyths surrounding blacks, indians, poles, etc.). These<br />\nmyths stigmatize the virgin. For example, one myth is<br />\nthat virgins are impotent or frigid. Of course some virgins<br />\nmay be impotent or frigid, and this may very well by why<br />\nthey are virgins, but there are plenty whose equipment is<br />\nin perfect operating condition and who are virgins for<br />\nreligious reasons, or moral reasons without theological<br />\ninterpretation, or, Lord knows, for health reasons.<br />\nAnother myth is that virgins are virgins because they are<br />\nundesirable and have been forced into it. Like the myth I<br />\nhave just described, this is nonsense if it is taken as a<br />\ngeneralization. There are plenty of virgins who are<br />\ngorgeous, interesting, and engaging human beings. Still<br />\nanother myth surrounding virginity is that virgins are<br />\nashamed of their bodies and sex. In many, if not most<br />\ncases, nothing could be further from the truth. The<br />\nimplicit position of many virgins as such is that sex is<br />\nvery, very good, and because they believe this they<br />\nprotect it from anything that may do it harm according to<br />\ntheir belief system about it. For example, a virgin may<br />\nbelieve that sex ought to have a certain meaning. He/she<br />\ndoes not engage in sex under certain circumstances simply<br />\nbecause he/she is insisting that sex mean such and such<br />\n(e.g., marital commitment, \"real\" love, etc.). It won't do<br />\nto adopt the ridiculous position that sex is a brute fact<br />\nwithout meaning\u2014so is language outside of the rules and<br />\nconventions that people, as rational creatures, invent for<br />\nit. Sex, like language, may take on meaning, and giving it<br />\na certain meaning may be intuited as morally ideal. There<br />\nmay be many good reasons for insisting on a certain<br />\nmeaning in sex; one of them simply being that the<br />\nindividual who does so insist cannot really enjoy sex<br />\nwithout it.<br />\nThe condition, the attitudes, and the beliefs of the<br />\nvirgin must be respected. If .we believe in behaving<br />\nrespectfully toward other minority groups we should<br />\nbehave respectfully toward virgins. There are two<br />\nconcrete proposals to make: 1) do not operate on<br />\nassumptions about virgins that may be nothing but<br />\nridiculous myths, and 2) do not operate on the<br />\nassumption that the new acquaintance, the friend or<br />\nwhomever, wants to screw just because they clearly like<br />\nand enjoy you, and/or accept a date. \"Keepa you hands<br />\noff\" unles in one way or another, you're asked.<br />\nThomas Dahlberg, a graduate student in Philosophy, did<br />\nnot say whether he was a virgin or not. We can onlY<br />\nspeculate.<br />\n<br />\nLetters we got lots and lots of letters<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nOn Tuesday, April 12, a panel of the Undergraduate<br />\nAcademic Ethics Board met to hear charges against a<br />\nstudent who had been accused of cheating on an<br />\nIntroductory Chemistry examination. The student pled<br />\nguilty, and was subsequently failed in the course by<br />\nrecommendation of the hearing panel.<br />\nAs Presiding Official of the hearing, I was responsible<br />\nfor making the above mentioned facts known to the<br />\nHopkins community. The following day, I personally<br />\ndelivered to Eric Garland, editor of the Friday edition of<br />\nthe News-Letter, a summary of the hearing that included<br />\nthose facts. Mr. Garland verbally assured me that this<br />\ninformation, in its original form, would be printed in the<br />\nFriday (April 15) issue of the N-L. It was not. I spoke to<br />\nMr. Garland about the deletion that same day, and he<br />\npromised to have Mike Deak, editor of the 'Tuesday<br />\nedition, include the summary that Tuesday. It was not<br />\ndone. I again contacted Mr. Garland, who graciously<br />\nshifted the blame to Mr. Deak, and 'again promised to<br />\nplace the Ethics Board's five-line insert in the next Friday<br />\nedition (April 22).<br />\nOn Friday, htere appeared a boxed insert on the<br />\n<br />\nbottom of page three entitled \"Ethics Board.\" What was<br />\nprinted, however, was not the simple statement that I had<br />\nsubmitted, but rather a typically irresponsible<br />\nNews-Letter comedy revue.<br />\nThis ill-founded attempt at satire, it seems, srlved only<br />\nto amuse the editorial staff of Hopkins' answel- to The<br />\nNational Lampoon, the irresponsible Friday News-Letter.<br />\nIt distresses me that the News-Letter feels free to<br />\nhandle the serious issue of academic integrity in such a<br />\nfarcical manner.

The reason the statement did not appear in<br />\nTuesday's News-Letter was that there took place a<br />\nbureaucratic mix-up between the two editors that resulted<br />\nin the temporary (if not permanent) loss-of the original<br />\nstatement.<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\n<br />\nWe read with some dismay the article in the Friday<br />\nNews-Letter concerning the state of cinema in Baltimore.<br />\nAs regards this past spring, the Graduate Club of Johns<br />\nHopkins University presented what we felt to be a<br />\nselection of films, free to all, representative of various<br />\ntechniques, eras and cultures. Since January, three<br />\nKurosawa movies alone have been shown, as well as films<br />\nby Mizoguchi, Ozu, Renoir, Resnais, Eisenstein, Griffith,<br />\nKeaton, Von Stroheim and Clair have been screened.<br />\nFurthermore, the series will continue all summer, and for<br />\na list of future films we refer the reader to an<br />\nadvertisement which appears elsewhere in this edition of<br />\nthe News-Letter.<br />\nIt was unfortunate that Friday's article slighted such a<br />\nseries as this, and we suggest that in the future, before<br />\ngoing to Howard Community College to check out the<br />\nmovies, the staff should check across Charles St. in the<br />\nGrad Club, and in its files of Campus notes(!) for records<br />\nof our paq movies.<br />\nR.L.

The first was a pboto session in<br />\nthe Cabinet room where Jimmy Carter formally accepted<br />\nthe papers of the Woodcock delegation. This was the<br />\npanel sent to Hanoi to inquire into the MIA's and the<br />\ndiplomatic opportunities. The delegation consisted of<br />\nLeonard Woodcock, President of the United Auto<br />\nWorkers, Senator Mike Mansfield, former ambassador<br />\nCharles Yost, Mrs. Mary Wright Edelman, and<br />\nCongressman G.V. Montgomery. Everyone (press) lined<br />\nup in front of the Cabinet room door and when the lights<br />\nwere turned on (the signal to inter) we rushed in and<br />\nstarted taking pictures. They only allowed 36 seconds for<br />\nthis session\u2014the time varies for each session.<br />\nAfter this photo session, there was a press conference<br />\nin the press room with Secretary of the Interior, Cecil<br />\nAndrus, and Secretary of the Agriculture, Bob Bergland.<br />\nThey were discussing the Administration's evaluation and<br />\naction dealing with the drought experienced in the West<br />\nand Midwest. It was during this session that I had my first<br />\ncrack at the White House press. They were cocky, biting,<br />\nrude, and very effective. At first I was surprised, but then<br />\nI talked to a few of the \"old pros\". They all echoed the<br />\nsame thing\u2014it's a job, and as a job you must come to<br />\nterms with the way you approach it. It was still a little<br />\nhard for me to swallow, but my day was young.<br />\nAt the conclusion of the drought conferen z the<br />\nPePresident surprised everyone by coming in to introduce<br />\nthe Woodcock delegation. Leonard Woodcock gave a<br />\nshort speech followed by a question session. Apparently<br />\nthere were discrepancies in statements among the panel<br />\nmembers prior to the conference. This was enough to<br />\nopen the gates to a wave of questions, many openly<br />\ncynical.<br />\nI made it through these sessions in one piece, and<br />\n<br />\nreturned after lunch. There was going to be another photo<br />\nsession in the Oval Office with the President as he was<br />\naccepting official portfolios from some foreign<br />\nambassadors. After we marched into the Roosevelt Room<br />\nacross the hall from the Oval Office, we were informed of<br />\nthe procedure. We would be allowed in for 45 seconds of<br />\npicture taking, then about 3-5 minutes to leave and return<br />\nto the Roosevelt Room. Because of the time limit people<br />\nwere pushing and shoving. I even saw a punch thrown.<br />\nThe five ambassadors were from Austria, Chile, Kenya,<br />\nGuinea, and Swaziland. We<br />\nwere having a difficult time trying to figure out what<br />\ncountry each ambassador was from, and much to my<br />\nsurprise, one of the photographers had word sent in that<br />\nwe would appreciate a little introduction. Well, next time<br />\nwe went in and Jimmy Carter introduces the ambassador<br />\nas his good friend from Kenya. I couldn't believe it. It was<br />\nlights, camera, action, and we even added a little dialogue!<br />\nNot that I'm knocking Carter's sincerity. In fact, you<br />\ncould see the true concern and grief in his face when he<br />\nearlier spoke of the MIA's. It's just that I was naive\u2014not<br />\nthat I didn't know of the PR bullshit, but the depth and<br />\nthe strength of the PR really shook me. There I was<br />\nstanding in front of the President's desk in the Oval Office<br />\nand I felt like saying \"cut, take it from the t p, and<br />\nJimmy, do you think you could put your arm around his<br />\nshoulder this time?\" But my day still had many pages left.<br />\nAfter the photo session in the Oval Office, I went back<br />\nto the Press room, where they were preparing to begin a<br />\npress coliteLeilLe Wait Jouy Foweit. it is at tills press<br />\nconference that I felt that some members of the press<br />\nshowed poor taste and outright obnoxious manners. As an<br />\nexample, one of the 12 returned bodies from Vietnam<br />\nwas actually discovered to be an Oriental. Mondale had<br />\npersonally notified the family of the \"mistake\".(The 12<br />\n<br />\n_families had been given prior notice that the bodies were<br />\nbeing returned). Jody Powell did not disclose the name of'<br />\nthe family since he felt that their grief need not be<br />\ncompounded by the press' harrassment. It made sense ot<br />\nme, but reporters from all over were demanding the<br />\nfamily's name. One went far enough to threaten Powell<br />\nby saying that he would get 50 volunteers to call 10 of<br />\nthe MIA's families (this would cover all the families), and<br />\nin this way he would find the names of all 12 families. I<br />\noverheard another national reporter bragging among his<br />\ncohorts that he'd have the name that very afternoon. I<br />\ncould stand it no longer, and asked him why he wanted it.<br />\nHe threw a lot of crap about it being newsworthy, and I<br />\n. again asked why. Well, he told me how naive and young<br />\nand stupid I was, and I told him what i thought of his<br />\n\"newsworthy\" reporting. Well, one less invitation to<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nAnother matter which bothered me was the security. It<br />\nseems to me that if I had had a gun, I could easily have<br />\nsent Mr. Carter back amongst his forefathers. Admittedly,<br />\n1 had had a Secret Service clearance, but all the<br />\ninformation was Oven over the phone. I'm not saying I<br />\ncould get away with it, but what about the person willing<br />\nto give his life to bring the spotlight to his cause? But, as<br />\nI've learned, the side order for democracy is exposure.<br />\nAll in all, I had a great time and was both impressed<br />\nand irritated with the press. I can't help but think that a<br />\nlittle respect might go a long way. It's true that the press<br />\nmust analyze its information critically, but must they<br />\nobtain it inconsiderately? Perhaps I've singled out the<br />\nexceptions, and maybe in my nervousness they made a<br />\nstronger impression. Whatever, I've learned there's an<br />\nawful lot that goes on behind the newspapers we read<br />\neach day we wouldn't write home to Mother about.<br />\nBarry Muradian'<br />\n<br />\nStudent, defend thyself:Get those shoeracks<br />\nBY DAVE DE SMITH<br />\nVisitors to our Johns<br />\nhopkins campus see a group of nice buildings and lawns,<br />\nseemingly secure. The fortresses of Garland and Barton<br />\nHalls defy entry by any criminal;besides, everything at<br />\nHopkins has a lock. It must be remembered, however,<br />\nthat no placein ilaltimore is totally secure, even Hopkins.<br />\nThe riff-raff that all too often make.theirpresence felt in<br />\nthis city are not really kept off campus. Hopkins has not,<br />\nand probably will not,decide to become more isolationist,<br />\nmore protective, unless force to. Since the university<br />\nhas adopted the \"good neighbor\" policy instead of<br />\nerecting thirty-foot\" fences, anyonce erecting 30-foot<br />\nfences, anyone can walk on campus. Even before<br />\nHopkins' annual open house, many non-students were<br />\nknown to be wabdering the quads of Homewood.<br />\nCoupled with open dormitory doors, this oftern leads to<br />\ntrouble. Campus police are as helpful in preventing crime<br />\nas the non-existent fences. Homewood is a well-lit<br />\ncampus; there is usually no problem seeing any criminal<br />\n<br />\nacts as they progress. The problem lies in the preventative<br />\nmeasures. All students were asked to keep their doors and<br />\nwindows locked when not at home. Most students have<br />\ndone so. All housemasters have been asked to keep front<br />\ndoors locked. Few are even closed before eleven o'clock.<br />\nBasement doors in the dorms<br />\nare seldom locked,<br />\n<br />\nCrime!<br />\nproviding easy entry and exit.<br />\nThough the campus police are trained and conduct<br />\nregular patrols of the campus, they cannot be everywhere.<br />\nWhen a situation calls for police action, the campus patrol<br />\nmust be called. They are not likely to be already on their<br />\nway.<br />\nAs most of you know, and expected, there was crime at<br />\n<br />\nthe Spring Fair. The mardi gras atmosphere is one which<br />\nhas encouraged _rowdiness and activity here at Hopkins,<br />\nbut one which is produced at the students' expense. By<br />\nnow you may have had time to to forget about the fair's<br />\ncrime. Or you may have veen informed by now that ,lite<br />\ninjured Hopkins undergrad wasm't hurt? the<br />\nincident stirred a lot of discussion abouttecurity and the<br />\nvalue of the Spring Fair itself. If we must put \"3400 On<br />\nStage.\" we'd better be more prepared. The time to Make<br />\ncertain that security is working is before it has a chance to<br />\n'fail, as it did at the fair. If our university insists on<br />\ncreating potentially dangerous situations on our own<br />\ncampus without providing adequate protection, it is time<br />\nto have a'talk with the universiyt. That we do not have<br />\nlocking gences is okay, as long as we remember how to<br />\nbuild them. Above all, don't despair. Hopkins is as safe as<br />\nyou can get in Baltimore, and if this article has mad e any<br />\nstudents uncomfortable in their dorm room,look in your<br />\ncloset.

Prologue<br />\nNevertheless if anarchy is to be avoided, the individuals<br />\nwho make up a society mustj<br />\nfrom time to time be<br />\nreminded, at least in symbol, of the underlying order that<br />\nis supposed to guide their social activities. Ritual<br />\nperformances have this function for the participation<br />\ngroup as a whole; they momentarily make explicit what is<br />\nothe ise a iction. \u2014Edmund Le<br />\n<br />\nI'm getting old. The youthful elasticity that permitted.<br />\npositions of sexual derring-do has gone taut, and every<br />\nnow as I write (stretched on a lumpy motel bed in King of<br />\nPressia, Pa., the Willy Loman of bigtime college golf) my<br />\nlumbar feels like lumber and my ulcer burns with<br />\nunrequited desire I can no longer hope to consummate.<br />\nJust moments ago, the sight of a cocktail waitress'<br />\nbobbing boobs did not send my heart a pitter-patter. My<br />\nbusiness associates exchanged what Victorian novelists<br />\ncalled \"knowing glances\" I<br />\nthat left<br />\nmy head with a dull migraine ache. What's that stupid old(<br />\njtike? \"You're only as old as the girls you feel?\" I longh<br />\nfor the solitariness of the motel room and a quick game of<br />\ntelevision roulette before retiring to the land of the<br />\nSandman. Yes, I suppose I'm getting on in years and I<br />\nhave only the memories of happier days to content<br />\nmyself.<br />\n\"You'll remember this night for ever,\" my mother<br />\nwhispered while adjusting my collar and stuffing my pants<br />\npocket with Maalox tablets<br />\nVisions of dread ease into my consciousness. It's the<br />\nnight of my Senior Prom. Happier days? If one consider<br />\nhappiness a relative function, I suppose so. Besides, The<br />\nHoneymooners is over, and now the Silver Savior, Rex<br />\nHumbard, has taken control with his Holiday Inn concept<br />\nof the Great Beyond. Reluctantly I make the decision,<br />\nand now I slip a quarter into the slot on the headboard<br />\nand as the bed starts to vibrate, I remember----<br />\n<br />\nof ritual (as anthropologists, the voyeurs of academia, call<br />\nit) than just sexual silliness. There must be some method<br />\nto this madness of tuxedoes, corsages, etiquette briefings,<br />\nappointments with hairstylists (Adam and Eve's \"We<br />\ncut both ways\" \u2014 offered special prom discounts),<br />\nsleepless nights of worry, the careful clipping of toe and<br />\nfingernails<br />\nthe inventory of such acts makes my mind<br />\nshudder with embarrassment. What a foolish young blade<br />\nI was!<br />\nThe scene: A deserted country road somewhere in<br />\ncentral New Jersey. It is an evening in mid-April and five<br />\nhigh school seniors sit inside a 1972 Mustang drinking<br />\nwhiskey and rye and, knowing that Prom Day will be the<br />\nday they die, are getting blown away.<br />\nMyself: Hey, don't knock masturbation. It's sex with<br />\n;omeone you love.<br />\nHarold Nunamachr: What a case of meglomania!<br />\nFred Glaubinger: (Holding fingers to nose) Who di,<br />\nthat?<br />\nGorilla Muldoon: He who smellt it dealt it.<br />\n\"One Night Stan\" Wertheimer: Speaking of which, are<br />\nyou still planning to take Mary Lou Hooper to the prom?<br />\nFred: If she ever crawla out from under her rock-Myself: You want a knuckle sanwich, Glaubinger?<br />\nFred: Yeah, and hold the mayo,crater face.<br />\nHarold: -I tried to cop a feel off Audrey Sedlek<br />\nSaturday night<br />\nGorilla: Audrey Sedlek tried to feel a cop Saturday<br />\nnight?<br />\nFred: Did you know that E.J. Korvettes stands for<br />\nEleven Jewish Korean War Vets?<br />\nMyself: Mary Lou Hooper's not much to look at, but<br />\nshe sure is a whiz at geometry.<br />\nStan: You hear the one about the American<br />\nbusinessman in Tokyo<br />\nI was lying to the guys I hadn't even asked Mary Lou<br />\nyet, let alone even gone out on a date with her. Put a few<br />\njiggers of Jim Beam in me and I'm likely to tell all. So the<br />\nnext morning I woke with a headache and an obligation<br />\nto ask Mary Lou to the prom. It wasn't going to be a<br />\npiece of cake, but at least I could try. And if I failed...<br />\nI'm convinced the Clint Eastwood sunglasses did the<br />\ntrick. I sauntered up to her table in the cafeteria wearing<br />\nmy tightest t-shirt, and without gulping, asked her for a<br />\ndate that Friday night, a scant two weeks before the<br />\nprom. She looked dreamily at me with those marbles I<br />\ncthink were her eyes and the words<br />\ncame out on<br />\nangel's breath, \"I'd love to!\" I'd by to. Christ, I could've<br />\nwet my pants. Luckily I made my escape by squeaking<br />\nout a lie, \"Excuse me, but I have a reservation to use the<br />\nweight room,\" which she accepted with that crinkle of a<br />\ngrin I soon learned to treasure.<br />\nLet me draw a picture of Mary Lou Hooper. Better,<br />\nhcre's her yearbook picture.<br />\n<br />\nby Mike Deak<br />\n<br />\n3. Why do<br />\nHummingbirds<br />\n<br />\nrs,<br />\nWho walks these locker-covered halls? Tradition, as Tevye<br />\nwould shout to the multitude. Tradition in the form of<br />\nthe ghosts of the innumerable illuminaries Somerville<br />\nHigh has given to the world. Here comes the most famous,<br />\nPaul Robeson, a man who needs no introduction and first<br />\nperformed Othello on the auditorium stage; also in show<br />\nbiz, Lee Van Cleef, a distant cousin by a great aunt, the<br />\nprince of spaghetti westerns; and a hearty top of the<br />\nmorning to those handsome boys in Varsity Club jackets,<br />\nCharley Winner, ex-coach of the New York Jets, and Joe<br />\nLis, platoon first baseman for the Seattle Mariners; and<br />\nfinally (the list has to end sometime) there's Gentleman<br />\nRay Bateman, favorite to defeat OTB (\"One Term<br />\nByrne\") in this year's gubernatorial race. With such<br />\nmodels, no wonder we thought the world was our oyster<br />\nand only the sky was the limit.<br />\nWe looked forward to the Senior Prom as eagerly as the<br />\nnatives of Capistrano look to the return of the swallows.<br />\nExactly why I don't know. Why do hummingbirds hum<br />\nVanity of vanities, the old ecclesiastical saying goes, the<br />\nrites of spring, Sioutfir, beauty, and virility. Unfortunately<br />\nI was familiar with none of the above, so I saw the prom<br />\nas a golden fleece of an opportunity to legitimize The Big<br />\nScore, the respectable and socially acceptable deflowering<br />\nof that bubbly tulip I had trained my beady little eyes on<br />\never since she moved here from Ho Ho Kus in seventh<br />\ngrade, the effervescent, ever lubricous Mary Lous Hooper.<br />\nThere must be something more to this native's model<br />\n<br />\nVisions of<br />\nranges and<br />\ne gnoirs<br />\n<br />\nMary Lou's on the left, and the other two mugs happen to<br />\nbe Stan Wertheimer and Isabel Horowitz who were our<br />\ndoubledate for the prom. If the phrase \"bottom of the<br />\nbarrel\" occurs to you, please be kind and remember that<br />\nbeauty is in the eye of the beholder, and, goddamit, we<br />\nwere desperate.<br />\nMix two parts memory and three parts desire and you'll<br />\nknow why Eliot called April the cruellest month. That<br />\nFriday came faster than Linda Lovelace (a little teenage<br />\nhumour, very little in fact) and I was a prime contender in<br />\na Maxwell Smart incompetency contest. I cut myself<br />\nshaving with an electric raxor, wore my underwear inside<br />\n,out, singed my scalp with my hot comb, and so on. I<br />\nconned my brother into lending me his jalopy, a<br />\nzooped-up '69 Cougar with its nose stuck up in the air<br />\nlike a blue-blooded Ivy Leaguer, which prompted Mr.<br />\nHooper to sarcastically chortle, \"When does the<br />\ncountdown begin, space cadet?\"<br />\n\"Wilbur,\" Mrs. Hooper screeched, \"remember your<br />\nmanners. Mike's our guest, you know.\" \"<br />\n\"Just joshin' son,\" h replied with a kind-hearted<br />\npunch on the shoulder that sent me groveling towards the<br />\ngutter.<br />\n\"Now you have Mary Lou back before midnight,\" Mrs.<br />\nHooper waved a matronly finger, \"she needs her beauty<br />\nsleep.\"<br />\n\"She better take an overdose of sleeping pills if that's<br />\ntrue,\" her younger brother Herb Hooper hissed.<br />\n\"How you like one 'cross your lips?\" Mr. Hooper<br />\nthreatened with his. Red Foxx impression.<br />\n\"Take care you two,\" her mother shouted as we drove<br />\naway,\"I know how I was when I was you age.\"<br />\n\"Parents,\" Mary Lou said with that french fry smile.<br />\n\"Yeah, parents,\" I replied, a graduate of the Gary<br />\nCooper School of Witty Conversation, summa cum lousy.<br />\nI suppose all these allusions to movie stars<br />\nunconsciously reveal the role flicks played in my<br />\neducation of social behavior outside the family. I think it<br />\nwas also Edmund Leach who said that myth and ritual<br />\nwere one and the same, or t least in merican culture,<br />\ntry to be. But enough of the theory. I took Mary Lou to<br />\n<br />\ndni<br />\nthe last remaining Jerry lewis Cinema in New JerseY<br />\nI<br />\npet<br />\nits<br />\nin<br />\n\"Frenzy,\"<br />\na<br />\nfilm<br />\nthat<br />\nHitchcock's<br />\nAlfred<br />\nway I th ught would set a romantic mood. And indeeivent<br />\ndid, as with the first shot of a naked corpse floating'\"\u201e01<br />\nThames, her hand jumped into mind and stayed there<br />\nqtas<br />\nrest of the movie.<br />\n\"Wasn't that a good movie,\" I said driving to the at ofn<br />\nYork Inn in Raritan, an infamous local hangout who:<br />\nare not required if you slip the bouncer a buck. ri rchl<br />\nknow,\" she replied in a bashful tone,\"I don't like iv\u00b0 Ito e.<br />\nti<br />\nthat scare you.\"<br />\n\"But it's only a movie, it's only a strip of caul Lik(<br />\npassing before a light bulb, it's not even human...\" leke ca<br />\n1t1S1<br />\n\"Well, let's not argue about it,\" Mary Lou said, :<br />\n4 an<br />\nhave a goodtime \"'<br />\n\"We'll have a pitcher of Rheingold,\" I told the yva:It1 Und<br />\nari<br />\nin my eighteen year old voice impression (I was,d qartt<br />\n'<br />\nseventeen and a half and only God knows how old<br />\nLou was.)\"You like beer?\"<br />\n\"I don't know,\" she sighed, \"I've never had any.

Had I committed some social faux<br />\nwas she merely submitting to her primitive animal u<br />\nto let me take her in one glorious swoop and slie<br />\nmerely helping the situation along? I never knew, bd,<br />\nat that instant, Gorilla Muldoon dropped by with his s<br />\nances Tooty, and together they drank three-quarter<br />\nthe pitcher, and I had the other quarter, and MatY4<br />\njust sat there silently smiling and laughing when reci\"/<br />\nI wiped my mouth on my sleeve and coree<br />\nsuggested to Tooty and Muldoon, \"I think it's tiro (ji<br />\nhave to go.\" And we all got up and walked out t\u00b0<br />\nparking lot, said our goodbyes, and departed in oPP<br />\ndirections, Tooty and Muldoon off to North 131<br />\nwh re neither one lived (but where there was this ribi<br />\nlittle spot, you see, off Burnt Mills Road,....) and we<br />\nthrough Raritan to Somerville and home.<br />\n#<br />\n\"Well, we're home,\" I turned off one engine '<br />\n5'<br />\nfiguratively on another, \"did you have a good time?'')<br />\n'<br />\ne<br />\nShe looked at me with that glazed look in her eY,<br />\nwas the best time I've had this year,\" she whispere'to<br />\nthis a cue?

I regained feeling and was<br />\ntantly aware of a bulge in my jeans. Till that time I'd<br />\n4sidered myself a draft doger in the war between the<br />\nkes, but now I was committed to a cause.

Falling in love.<br />\nTradition taught us that the Prom -itself was not as<br />\nimportant as what happened after the Prom. The Prom<br />\nwas just the stuffing for this turkey of a ritual. Stan and I<br />\nmade the shrewdest of plans; a quick midnight snack<br />\nafterwards at the refurbished Bridgewater Diner, and a<br />\ndrive East, to either New York, for some more partying,<br />\nor to the Shore, and a litt e rom nce. I pr ferred the<br />\nlatter; a fantasy keeping me awake nights had Mary Lou<br />\nand I cavorting on some Caribbean beach, the two of us<br />\nalone, running hand in hand as the eaves, endless waves,<br />\nlapped our ankles<br />\nWe decided to take Stan's car, a machine that had all<br />\nthe smell and color of a lemon , a 1970 Ambassador<br />\nStan's father only bought because American Motors<br />\nsponsored the Mets games on television. It wasn't the<br />\nbest-looking car; in fact Mr. Hooper remarked, \"What<br />\nhappened?

I squawked, my necl<br />\nsqueezed by a boa constrictor of a necktie. Note of<br />\nexplanation: this was 1974 so standards of dress were<br />\nrelaxed to allow what Amy Vanderbilt calls<br />\n\"semi-formal\" attire.<br />\n\"She's busy getting plastic surgery,\" Herb sneered,<br />\n\"You better hope they don't take the bandages off till<br />\nnext week.\"<br />\n\"How would you like me to part your hair with a<br />\ncrowbar,\" Mr. Hooper shook a first at him.<br />\n\"Why Isabel, you look just like Deanna Durbin,\" lrs.<br />\nHooper praised, \"oh but you kids are too young to<br />\nremember her.\"<br />\n\"Mike, do you have protection?\" Mr. Hooper asked witl<br />\na chiseled grin.<br />\nI nodded my head, thinking of the four fiesta-colored<br />\nTrojans -- \"The Korvette of the Contraception scene\" -stuffed in my pocket along with the Maalox, and realizing<br />\nhe must have meant something else, blurted out,\"Oh yes,<br />\nAllstate. Don't worry sir, your Mary Lou will be in good<br />\nhands.\"<br />\n\"Well, just watch where you put those good hands,\" he<br />\nm cked with a wink of his left eye.<br />\nJust then Mary Lou appeared. I gasped out of surprise.<br />\nShe was actually good-looking as she, wearing a saffron<br />\ndress with a neckline that played footsie with her cleavage<br />\nand her pimples covered by so many layers of make-up I<br />\nwondered if her Avon lady could have retired to Miami<br />\nBeach on this commission, waltzed towards me.<br />\n\"You look absolutely stunning,\" I said. (\"Stunning?\"<br />\nStan whispered, \"What is he blabbering about?\" I'd<br />\nforgotten to tell him I had watched Dan Daily movies for<br />\nthe past month to gain insight into suave, sophisticated<br />\nbehavior.) \"Shall we go,\" I said taking her arm and then<br />\nturning to her parents, \"Ta-ta.\"<br />\n\"Oh Wilbur,\" Mrs. Hooper swooned, \"chivalry isn't<br />\ndead.\"<br />\n\"It's vaudeville that's dead, Hedda,\" he answered,<br />\n\"vaudeville.\"<br />\nAs we drove away, I said to Mary Lou,\"Your mother's<br />\nname isn't really Hedda, Hedda Hooper is it?\"<br />\nShe smiled that shoestring smile, \"Parents.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, parents,\" I replied. Tht evening was off to a<br />\ngreat start.<br />\nMartinsville Inn sits hidden somewhere in the Watchung<br />\nMoutains north of Bound Brook, and Stan, ever the<br />\nclown, put lead in his foot and tok the dangerous hairpin<br />\ncurves at near fifty. \"It's macho,\" he explained to our<br />\ndates.<br />\n\"It's not macho anything,' Isabel laughed like a<br />\nlooney and inched over towards Stan. A feeble smile<br />\ntwitched my lips as Mary Lou slinked towards me. What<br />\nhappened next was a case of bad fate. The moment her<br />\nhand landed on mine in a tight clench of safety, I sneezed,<br />\nand instinctively, brought my :hand up to my mouth with<br />\nher hand coming along for the ride. It was a particularly<br />\nbrothy sneeze and I was at a loss of words. \"I didn 't get<br />\nyour hand wet, did I?\" And she shook her head, and took<br />\nher hand away to adjust her corsage. When she wasn.t<br />\nlooking, I wiped my hand on the car seat, not wishing to<br />\ndig into my pocketful of miracles for a hankie.<br />\nThe theme for the Prom was \"Guys and Dolls,\" but<br />\nnobody could tell it from the sleazy rock band, a bunch<br />\nof local punks called \"The Wild Strawberries,\" who didn't<br />\nknow \"Fugue for Tinhorns\" from \"Stairway to Heaven\"<br />\nThe Decorations Committee had been hit with a case of<br />\nmono and, consequently, there was a notable lack of<br />\ndecorations, so it didn't really seem like a Prom. But our<br />\nhearts did not despair; we were rebellious children,<br />\ncontemptu us of anything reeking of Tradition, th ugh<br />\nat the sale time deeply guided by the precepts of<br />\nTradition. No wonder that 5% of our class (by latest<br />\ncount) had found their way into the Crackerbox Palace.<br />\nWe were treated to the typical Martinsville Inn dinner,<br />\nthe same fare of anti-pasta, manicott, filet mignon half<br />\nbaked potatoes, and vanilla ice cream with \"sprinkles,\"<br />\nmy father's lkowling league banquet had. But the food<br />\nwas washed down by .a special presentof the Faculty Club,<br />\nglasses of slightly foxy Cold Duck that made our tongues<br />\nthe lucid instrume ts of witty execution one ;would<br />\nexpect of the Three Stooges at a debutante ball.<br />\n\"With the amount of Christians around here,\"<br />\nrem rked Murray Rabinowitz, the class valedictorian and<br />\nalso headed for Hopkins,\"they should call this 'Goys and<br />\n<br />\nDills.'\"<br />\n\"Did you know what you are, Murray?' I gal...Tied.<br />\n\"you're a J.A.P., a Jewish-American Poet.\" Mary Lou's<br />\nlaughter shrilled in my ear, \"Goodness woman, are you<br />\ntrying to make me another Norm Crosby?\" which only<br />\nelicited more laughter.<br />\nStan had been nibbling on Isabel's ear for the last half<br />\nhour while Mary Lou and I boogied on the dance floor.<br />\nWe hardly ,got within two feet of each other and our eyes<br />\nconcentrated' roo much on each other's movements to<br />\nhave any meaningful contact. And after we danced, we<br />\ndrank and the hours flew by without our t noticing and<br />\nthe 'band. was playing \"Rikki, Don't I Lose That<br />\n'Number' for the fifth time when Stan and Isabel briefly<br />\ninterrupted their ear-nibbling and suggested we move on.<br />\nIt was quarter to three and neither of us really cared, the<br />\nCold Duck had taken control, and Mary and I were busy<br />\nexchanging life histories. \"Ah but I was born with a cleft<br />\npalate and a harelip. Top that!\"<br />\ni\"My sister died of leukemia,' she replied. It was the<br />\nonly serious moment of the night and somebody turned<br />\noff the lights, a situation 4 j. took advantage of by<br />\nsnuggling .up and giving her a kiss slightly more \"mature\"<br />\nthan the one in the car. The lights came back on, and the<br />\nprom was'oyer, and I felt as if nothing had happened, as if<br />\nthe Prom was just a big fake, a dreadful hallucination. I<br />\ndidn't feel any differently, and I was sober enough to<br />\nrealize all the trauma had gone for naught.<br />\nThe coup d' grace. Once back in the car, Stan slipped<br />\nthe secret weapon out of his pocket, a big fat joint<br />\nwrapped in pink paper. \"How you young ladies like to<br />\nget a case of reefer madness?\" he gurgled.<br />\nThey were too far gone to offer any idealistic resistance<br />\nso the joint, like country doctor, made its rounds.<br />\n\"Stan,\" I shouted. \"You just went through a stop sign.<br />\nYou want us get thrown in the klinker? Don't you know<br />\nwhat stopitneans?\"<br />\n\"Squeal tires on .'ilavement?\" and bellowed with that<br />\ninsidious laughter. I grabbed t .joint my Mary Lou who<br />\nhad been fondling it for . thd past five minutes and<br />\nimmediately burned my firer. The joint fell to the floor,<br />\nand out of anger, my foot fell on the joint, and that was<br />\nthat. We were now headed east on Route 22, an asphalt strip<br />\nof decadent commercialism which lead to the small<br />\n_scatter point graph of lights in the distance of New York<br />\n\"Where are we going?\" Mary Lou<br />\n\"Did you know that Mery Griffin sang What a Lovely<br />\nHunch ot Cocoanuts' when he Was with Freddy Martin in<br />\n1949?\" I replied, my mind on other than the obvious.<br />\n',You're so kooky,\" she sighed, and rested her head on<br />\nmy shoulder.<br />\n.\"Kooky, kooky, lend me your comb,\" I ditted and<br />\ngently stroked her hair. We were almost to Springfield<br />\nwhere the highway splits and. Stan was speeding along,<br />\nIsabel's'hand in his lap.<br />\nI'll reme ber this night for ever,' Mary Lou<br />\npurred, \u00b0it's been so much like heaven on Earth .1 could<br />\nalmost cry.\"<br />\nLittle, did she suspect that in just a few moments she<br />\nwould plead with Stan to stop the car in the parking lot<br />\nof the 'famous flagship) so she 'could lurch to a light pole<br />\nand puke all. the food'and drink she'd had for the past<br />\nthree months. , It, was not a 'particularly pretty sight;<br />\nseeitig her dress shudder with every retch made my own<br />\nstomach grumble.<br />\n\"1 think we better bag the trip to the shore,\" I told<br />\nOtan.\"You want some Maalox, Mary Lou?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Well, Somerville's not French Lick, Indiana,<br />\nwhispered to her. We were sitting in her back yard on<br />\nsome rusty lawn furniture watching the sun rise.<br />\n\"Mike, sometimes I don't understand anything you<br />\nsay,\" she smiled weakly, c`but that's why I like you so<br />\nmuch.\"<br />\n\"Visions of oranges and peignoirs, my dear,\" I replied,<br />\n\" that's what I see in you.\" My eyes lingered to the East<br />\nwhere the sun was now rising through the lowest<br />\n*branches of the catalpa tree, and all th fantasies of<br />\nMary Lou and me on the beach at Lavalette, i* ntertwined<br />\nan the sand, and lett* the first lavender sweeps of<br />\nsunl4ght brush over us. entered my mind. The mammoth<br />\nscale Of my self-delusionment suddenly became obvious<br />\nand a shr ud of sleepiness suddenly came over me.<br />\n\"I really must go,\" I said and bent over to kiss her.<br />\n\"Prase don't\" she pulled away, \"there's still vomit<br />\non my lips.\"<br />\nI remember 'little: of the walk home. Isabel and Stan<br />\nhad driven off to their lovenest and I was left alone to<br />\ncontemplate my fate. What was to come of me?<br />\nI slipped between the sheets and made ready f4r my<br />\nexcursion into the land of the Sandman.,I heard the first<br />\nrumblings of morning; my mother shufftngabout in her<br />\nsmile slippers and putting the bacon to fry; my father<br />\nclearing his sinuses and his urine cascading into the toilet<br />\njust the other side of the hall.<br />\nI had returned to Earth, Amen.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 10/news-letter/may 3, 1977<br />\n<br />\nFREE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMa' 7 Hidden Fortress<br />\n!vlat.) 2!

In tjie early spring, the Blue Jays<br />\nshared their limited facilities with the Orioles, with the<br />\nhighlight being Jim Palmer pitching batting practice \u2014 a<br />\ntask he doesn't perform for his own team. The Jays have<br />\ndisplayed prowess at the plate, but despite that have been<br />\ninconsistent in the field. When they play errorless ball<br />\nthey have been worthy of their national ranking and have<br />\nbeen invincible.<br />\nLast Saturday, though, the team's limitations came to<br />\nthe forefront as a giant-killing Swarthmore team helped<br />\nthe Jays ease into a co-championship with the Widener<br />\n'Millionaires' in the MAC Southeastern division.<br />\nThe action really began Friday when the ball team<br />\ntraveled to Franklin & Marshall to meet the champs of the<br />\nWestern division of their bracket of the MAC in what<br />\nshould have been a preview of the playoffs. The clawing<br />\nBlue Jays wok an easy game from a solid opponent<br />\nleading most of the game by three or four runs.<br />\nThe final tally was 6-4 with the batting hero senior Bob<br />\nBabb who stroked a home run out of the Lancaster, Pa.<br />\nstadium on the second pitch of the hame. Also<br />\ncontributing were Rick Law, whose offense of late has<br />\nbeen impressive, and Frank Parreira, who is climbing<br />\ntowards the .400 mark in hitting.<br />\nJason Sussman's strongest pitching of the year baffled<br />\nF&M until he tired after seven and gave way to relievers<br />\nBurns and Parreira who picked up the save. The team's<br />\ndefense was excellept throughout the contest.<br />\nSaturday, the Jays split a doubleheader with the<br />\nSwarthmore Garnet. Hopkins should have handled the<br />\nvisitors with relative ease, especially , after their<br />\ndestruction of athletic powerhouse F&M.<br />\nThe game began as it should have ended. After two of<br />\nthe first three men to face the Garnet hurler walked,<br />\ntimely clean-up hitter Dave Lewing cracked a double<br />\ngiving the home Jays a 2-0 lead.<br />\nBur 'OK pitching' from the visitors' best man, seven<br />\nwhopping err ors by our defense, and a partisan<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore crowd on Hopkins' own field combiOd to<br />\ngive the visitors an inspired 8-5 first game victory<br />\nOn the mound for JH, Mike Santo pitched valiantly but<br />\nhis sore shoulder prevented him from completing the<br />\ngame. Mike's exit paved the way for a Swarthmore revival<br />\nand 4 run outburst in the 6th of seven innings. Hopkins<br />\ncountered with three in their half of the inning but the<br />\nrally fell short with a man stranded on third base.<br />\nThe Blue Jays did a turnabout in the second game as<br />\nthe ace ot the staff Steffan Burns pitched a no-hitter<br />\nthrough the first out of the last inning. The final score<br />\nwas 5-2 with the bat of Brad Rosborough knocking in the<br />\nwinning runs. Rosborough has consistently gone out and<br />\npummeled the other team each game he has played this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe final tote for the regular season finds the Jays as<br />\nimpressive as last year's excellent team. Junior co-captain<br />\n<br />\nDave Emala has established himself as one of the finest<br />\nhitters in the country at any level. Senior co-captain Bob<br />\nBabb who has played outstanding defensively also leads<br />\nthe team in numerous offensive departments.<br />\nOutfield leader Dave Lewing and undefeated pitchers<br />\nSteffan Burns and Jason Sussman are the only other<br />\nreturning veterans from last year's team who will be back<br />\nnext year as only two seniors are departing.<br />\nAlso returning will be outstanding forst year men<br />\nFrank Parreira, Mike Santo, Brad Rosborough and at least<br />\nfour other starters. This group unlike the Widener-styee<br />\nrecruits are going to school while they win ballgames.<br />\nThe 15-6 Blue Jays will face off with Widener this<br />\nweekend in a play-off for the right to play Franklin &<br />\nMarshall, with the winner of the F&M game representing<br />\nthe Southern Division of the MAC in the NCAAplayoffs.<br />\n<br />\nCoekey trackers perform consistently well<br />\nDespite a 5-6 Fecord so far this spring, the Blue Jay<br />\ntrack learni has performed consistently well and has<br />\nestablished several new university' records.<br />\nThese new Hopkins standards include Jim Kennedy's<br />\n14:15.6 in the three-mile run and Bob Freamon's 4:19.3<br />\nin the one-mile race. Not only do these times represent<br />\nnew school records, but they are also the top<br />\nperformances this year in the MAC.<br />\nHowever, an overall lack of team depth has been deadly<br />\nfor the JHU thinclads. Success in track competition is<br />\ndifficUlty with'a small squad and the Jays' meet record<br />\nseems to bear this contention out.<br />\nOn April 12, the Blue Jays travelled to Lebanon Valley<br />\nCollege to participate in a three-way meet between<br />\nthemselves, their hosts and Washington College. When the<br />\ndust had finally cleared, Lebanon Valley had amassed<br />\n102.5 points, JHU had garnered 58 points and<br />\n<br />\nWashington had come across with only 20.5 points.<br />\nThe strength of the Hopkins effort was concentrated in<br />\nthe running events. Speedster Matt McLin, a freshman<br />\nfrom Hanover, Pal, showed the way in the sprint events.<br />\nplacing second in both the 110- and 220- yard dashes.<br />\nThe Jays literally ran away from the rest of the field in<br />\nthe distance run events. In the 880, Bob Alworth topped<br />\nthe field, while Tom Kepple and Bob Safier finished<br />\nfourth and fifth respectively. The one-mile run saw a JHU<br />\nsweep of the top three spots, with Freamon, Kennedy and<br />\nTim Whitcombe coming across the finish line in that<br />\norder. The ending of the three-mile also looked lixe a<br />\nmass gathering of Blue Jays, with Kennedy, Freamon and<br />\nWhitcombe finishing one, two, four.<br />\nOn April 16, the team travelled to Haverford for a meet<br />\nthat Head Coach Randy Cockey later called \"the low<br />\npoint of the season.\" The Jays were missing several key<br />\n<br />\nperformers and ended up losing to their hosts, 77-68,<br />\nwhen Haverford captured the final event (the mile relay)<br />\nby less than one second!<br />\nSenior-. Brett Miles and sprinter McLin led the Jay<br />\neffort at Haverford, as each mani captured first place<br />\nhonors in a pair of events. Miles was the top man in both<br />\nthe long jump and the triple jump, while Matt won the<br />\n110.: and 220- yard dashes.<br />\n\"The loss of those men really hurt us,\" Cockey<br />\ncommented.\"The team that was there pulled very hard to<br />\novercome our deficiencies, but we couldn't quite do it.\"<br />\nOn May 19, the team travelled up the road to Towson<br />\nState for a series of dual' meets\u2014one against Towson and<br />\none versus UMBC. Both of these opponents have excellent<br />\ntrack programs, so despite two losses (84-60 to Towson<br />\nand 87-55 to UMBC), Coach Cockey was extremely<br />\npleased with the squad's performance.<br />\n\"It was a fantastic team effort,\" the Coach noted,<br />\n\"especially from the distance men.\"<br />\nHe was referring specifically to Kennedy and Freamon,<br />\nboth of whom excelled in this competition.<br />\nFreamon established his record in this meet, while<br />\nKennedy took the 3-mile event in 14:15.1, a school<br />\nrecord at the time.<br />\nThat record lasted exactly four days, as Jim shattered<br />\nthat mark with his effort at a three-way meet against<br />\nDickinson and Ursinus on April 23. Kannedy took the<br />\n3-mile event in an incredible 15:15.6, tying the Dickinscji<br />\ntrack record and qualifying him for the national<br />\nchampionships later this month.<br />\nKennedy's effort, 'combine& with double victories<br />\nfrom McLin (\"the fastest sprinter at JHU in the last three,<br />\nyears\" according to Cockey) and Freamon enabled the<br />\nJays to ctitim a pair of victories on this day.<br />\nOn April 26, Hopkins hosted a three-way meet that<br />\nincluded Western Maryland and Loyola. Despite a pair of<br />\nwins from Freamon and an impressive effort from the<br />\nrelay teams;, the best that the Jays could do was to finish<br />\nin the middle, ahead of Loyola but trailing W. M.<br />\n<br />\n\fIn the unfortunate 12-11 loss to Cornell earlier this<br />\nseason, the Blue Jay stickmen seemed to lose their<br />\ncomposure after allowing a large lead to shrink away. At<br />\nWest Point on Saturday, the Jays showed that they have<br />\nlearned from their mistake.<br />\nBattling an inspired, 11th ranked Army squad on their<br />\nhome turf, Hopkins was forced to stage a fourth-quarter<br />\nrally to defeat the Cadets, 13-8, thus running the JHU<br />\nseason mark to 7-1 and enabling the Jays to hold onto<br />\ntheir third-place ranking in the coaches' poll.<br />\nThe Jays had opened the second half with a 5-1<br />\nadvantage and seemed set to roll over their adversaries.<br />\nHowever, Army came roaring on in the third quarter,<br />\noutscoring the Jays 5-2 in that session and trailing by only<br />\na single goal as the teams entered the final fifteen minutes<br />\nof play.<br />\nThe Cadet comeback was led by the phenomenal<br />\ngoaltending of Jose Olivero. While his teammates were<br />\npumping five goals into the Blue Jay net, Olivero was a<br />\nveritable fortress on defense. In the third period alone,<br />\nthe junior netminder made twelve saves as JHU<br />\ncould<br />\nconnect on only 2 of 22 shots.<br />\nHopkins scored in the first minutes of the<br />\nfourth<br />\nquarter to take an 8-6 lead, but Army kept comin<br />\ng. The<br />\nhome team tallied twice in succession to forge<br />\nan 8-8<br />\ndeadlock with less than ten minutes remaining<br />\nin the<br />\ncontest.<br />\n<br />\nAt this juncture of the game, Army Coach<br />\nDick Edell<br />\ncalled a time - out, a move that puzzled Jay<br />\nCoach Henry<br />\nCiccarone.<br />\n\"It (calling a time-out) surprised me,\"<br />\nthe JHU mentor<br />\nsaid. \"They had the momentum then\u2014<br />\nI was about to call<br />\na time-out, but he beat me to it.\"<br />\nCiccarone explained that the time-out<br />\nenabled his team<br />\nto regroup. Evidently this regrouping was<br />\nquite successful,<br />\nfor the Jays went back onto the<br />\nfield and totally<br />\ndominated play in the game's final minut<br />\nes, outscoring<br />\nthe Cadets 5-0.<br />\nJoe Garavente broke the tie two minutes<br />\nlater, taking a<br />\nfeed from Mike O'Neill and whipping<br />\nthe ball past<br />\nOlivero. That score was quickly followed<br />\nby goals from<br />\nDave Huntley and Bob Maimone, giving JHU an<br />\n11-8 lead<br />\nwith six minutes to play and sealing the victory.<br />\nAfter the game, Ciccarone revealed that the<br />\ngame,<br />\nstatistically speaking, had gone pretty much as<br />\nhe had<br />\nexpected. \"I figured that if we shot 65 times, we<br />\nwould<br />\nscore 15-18 goals,\" the Coach noted. \"I<br />\nalso was<br />\nconfident that our defense could hold them to under<br />\nten<br />\ngoals.\" Chic attribured his team's lower score (despi<br />\nte 73<br />\nshots) to Oliver's efforts, pointing out that the<br />\nArmy<br />\nnetminder \"made saves that kept us from blowi<br />\nng it<br />\nopen.\"<br />\nO'Neill, Huntley and Rich Hirsch were the leader<br />\ns on<br />\noffense for Hopkins as each player was credited<br />\nwith four<br />\n<br />\npoints. O'Neill had a goal and three assists<br />\nwhile Huntley<br />\ncontinued his year-long shooting spree with<br />\nfour goals.<br />\nThe continued fine effort from Hirsch (the<br />\nsenior<br />\nattackman had five points a week ago) is an<br />\nexcellent sign<br />\nas the team readies for its toughest month of<br />\nthe season.<br />\nThe Long Island native and four-year starter did<br />\nnot play<br />\nwell through the first part of the season and<br />\nhis return to<br />\nform could remove some of the burden<br />\nfrom his<br />\nteammates on attack. \u2022<br />\nIn this next two weeks, the Jays will face the<br />\nnumber<br />\nfour and the number two team in<br />\nthe country,<br />\nrespectively. This Saturday, JHU entertains Navy<br />\nwhile on<br />\nMay 14, Hopkins travels to College Park<br />\nto face the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland.<br />\nThe top eight teams in the country will then<br />\nparticipate<br />\nin the NCAA play-offs to determine<br />\nthe national<br />\nchampion. Round I is scheduled to be<br />\nplayed on<br />\nWednesday May 17, while Round 2 is to be<br />\nheld on<br />\nSaturday May 21. The two survivors will meet on<br />\nMay 28<br />\nat Charlottesville, Virginia for the Division<br />\nI national<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nAlthough the final is played at a pre-determin<br />\ned site,<br />\nthe first two rounds are contested at the home field<br />\nof the<br />\nhigher ranked of the two teams, and therefore Ciccar<br />\none<br />\ncalls both the Navy and Maryland games \"crucial\".<br />\n\"We need to win them both to make our own<br />\ndestiny<br />\nin the play-offs,\" Ciccarone concluded.<br />\n<br />\nBaby Jays rack up fourth straight victory<br />\nWith victories in its last four games, the Blue<br />\nJays<br />\nmen's Junior Varsity Lacrosse teem has moved its<br />\nrecord<br />\nto 5-3, marking the first time the team has been above<br />\nthe<br />\n.500 level all season.<br />\nThe Junior Jays are coached by Bert Mandelbaum<br />\n,a<br />\nPhD student at the Med School. Mandelbaum, a<br />\ngraduate<br />\nof Cortland State in New York, is assisted by a pair<br />\nof<br />\nformer JHU stickmen, Bill McCutcheon and Don<br />\nZimmerman.<br />\nThe Jays opened their season on the wrong foot,'<br />\ndropping their March 22nd contest to Wroexter, 14-9.<br />\nA<br />\ndry spell in the second quarter, during which<br />\nthe<br />\nopposition outscored JHU 4-0, sealed the openi<br />\nng game<br />\nsetback.<br />\nHopkins.trailed by a count of 2-1 after one quarter,<br />\nbut<br />\nthe Wroester second period rush produced a 6-1<br />\nhalftime<br />\nbulge and the Jays could never cut into that margin.

REALLY like that guy! But, then again, I<br />\nlike bubonic plague.<br />\nN-L: But seriously, Chuck, what changes do you plan to<br />\nmake if you are named to replace Fred Dierman?.<br />\nBarris: There are so many things that have to be done if<br />\nour school is to win a respectable audience share of<br />\napplications and contributions. But the admissions<br />\nprocess is what really determines whether you have a hit<br />\nor a turkey on your hands. Now what I've proposed to El<br /><br />\nPresidente is this. Stevie Baby, I said, we set up a,<br />\nthree-member celebrity admissions panel and each student<br />\nact will be auditioned and ranked from ()lie to ten-unless, after fo 45 seconds, any member of the panel<br />\ndecides that the student has no talent.<br />\nN-L: What happens then?<br />\nBarris: Hah Hah! That's when you get the old gongeroo!<br />\nIf all three panelists hate the candidate, he or she can set<br />\ngang-gonged!<br />\nN-L: Isn't that a bit cruel?<br />\nBarris: Maybe, but that's the way things go on the ol'<br />\nGong Show, and after I take over that's the way it will be<br />\nhere on the ol' Hop Show.<br />\nN-L: How often do you anticipate using the gong?<br />\nBarris: Well, every day on tee wee coast to coast we have<br />\na turkey to talent ratio of 5 to 2. I think the admissions<br />\ngame will be run along similar lines. The ol' gong will be<br />\ngetting a good workout. But that's what our audience<br />\nlikes.<br />\nN-L: Do you plan to televise these proceedings?<br />\nBarris: You bet your bong we do! I'm in business. I call it<br />\nthe \"open admissions\" game. I've taken every function of<br />\nlife and put it on the tube. I created the Dating Game, the<br />\nNewlywed Game, I gave George Carlin the idea for the<br />\nDivorce Game. Why not the Admissions Game? If it click<br />\nwe put the Med School Game on as a mid-season spin-off<br />\nreplacement.<br />\n-L: And all the action starts right here at homewood?<br />\nBarris: Absolutely! From Baltimore, almost live.<br />\nN-L: What band are you going to use to add to the fun? B<br />\nBarris: The Hopkins Band, of course. They're just as bad<br />\nas Mil,ton DeLugg and his Band With A Thug and they<br />\nwork cheaper.<br />\nN-L: What kind of panelists will uou use on the show?<br />\nBarris: Local people with no talent and no brains. Maybe<br />\nVince Bagli, Wally Orlinsky, and Barbara Mikulski to<br />\nstart.<br />\nN-L: There's more to your job than admissions, In fact, in<br />\nthe past, admissions did not even come under your<br />\nposition. You're supposed to be advising and counseling.<br />\nBarris: Well, I did advise one former News-Letter editor<br />\nwho thinks he can write. Bob, I said, there's a bus leaving<br />\nfor Missouri in five minutes. Be under it. Actually, the job<br />\nis what I want it to.be.When you're as big in the business<br />\nas I am, you write you own ticket. Then you take it to<br />\nJudge Hardy to have it fixed. But that's before your time.<br />\nN-L: Thank you, Chuck.<br />\nBarris: Well, this can't be the end. I have so much more to<br />\nsay.

It is with a noble heart<br />\nthat the United States and other signers of the 1967<br />\nTreaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Arms, are<br />\nwilling to take full responsibility for deciding this issue for,<br />\nthe rest of the countries of the world. The question at this<br />\ndate is not who shall possess a bomb, but why should the<br />\nU.S., under the provisions of President Carter's new<br />\nproposals to Congress, impose ineffective sanctions on<br />\nother countries that choose to sell nuclear technology?<br />\nThe President's newest proposals would give him the<br />\npower to sanction countries that do not comply with U.S.'<br />\nguidelines on dissemination (by with-holding fuel for<br />\nnuclear reactors). But the fact that West Germany and<br />\nFrance among others do not agree with Carter poses<br />\nseveral problems. These countries argue that the sale of<br />\nnuclear reactors and reprocessing plants is a major<br />\nelement of their present and future export trade<br />\nConsidering this position, .Carter should rpore carefully<br />\nweigh the effectiveness of his approach to the problem of<br />\nnuclear proliferation.<br />\nIt is a fact that many nations desire the knowledge and<br />\nmeans to produce nuclear weapons and it is also true that<br />\nwe cannot prevent these countries from acquiring the<br />\nbomb in the future. One by one, technicians in<br />\nunderdeveloped countries are discovering the secrets of<br />\nthe atom for themselves and with or without our<br />\napproval, me numner ot nuclear powers will continue to<br />\ngrow. Simply stalling the rate at which nations arel<br />\nacquiring the bomb does not solve the problem. The \"Say the secret woid and win anatom boilib.<br />\npossibility of atomic warfare is a recurring nightmare that,<br />\nmust be realistically dealt with; if Jimmy Carter wants to<br />\nsomething you see everyday<br />\nfree us of this spectre, he must attack the roots of<br /><br />\n--)<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n(<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n\u2018<br /><br />\n,<br />\n.1.&gt;<br /><br />\nP<br /><br />\n*<br />\n\u2022<br />\nir<br />\n\u2022f 1 v<br />\n//\u2022ff<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n74<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nq ?,f461<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n-4\\114<br /><br />\n,<br />\n\u2022\u201e<br /><br />\nnot allow us to return to this ideal) and secondly, if every<br />\nnation had the bomb. Before the horror of this possibility<br />\nclouds the rational thought process, consider what a<br />\npowerful deterent the universal possession of the bomb<br />\nwould be. Any nation that would dare to employ the<br />\nbomb against any other would be guaranteed total<br />\ndestruction. Actually, the idea is not as ridiculous as it<br />\nfirst appears, the mutual knowledge that both the U.S.<br />\nand the U.S.S.R.. wield weapons powerful enough to<br />\nannihalate tifeir populations, cities, in 1-rort everything of<br />\nvalue, has kept them from ever using them. (Or should<br />\nwe attribute our restraint to our more 'civilized' nature?)<br />\nThere is every reason to believe another nation faced with<br />\nthe consequences of nuclear war would as well be<br />\ndeterred. It is only the case in whic imbalance exists that<br />\na leader would be tempted to use the bomb.<br />\nBut however unlikely the first scenario may be and as<br />\nimminent as is the second, the point is that President<br />\nCarter undoubtedly harbors good intentions in trying to<br />\navert nuclear war by calling for agreement on<br />\nnon-proliferation, but his methods are doomed to failure.<br />\nHis choice of \"the establishment of common international<br />\nsanctions\" will not only fail to prevent the spread of<br />\nnuclear capability, but as he admits, it will 'adversely<br />\naffect certain allies whose cooperation is needed if we re<br />\nto achieve our ultimate obtctive of non-proliferation.\"<br />\nOstensibly, Mr. Carter is wL.1ng to risk the animosity of<br />\nour allies so that he can achieve his goal of short-term<br />\nnon-proliferation.<br />\nThose not possessing the bomb want it and whether<br />\nthey develop it themselves or acquire the technology<br />\nelsewhere does not matter; the result will be the same.<br />\nNon-proliferation does not dissolve the spectre of nuclear<br />\nholocaust, it only defines who will have the honor of<br />\ntaking art in the deadly game. Nobody wants a nuclear<br />\nwar, but sanctioning those countries, often our West<br />\n;propean allies that choose not to abide by our policy of<br />\nton-proliferation, is not only failing to stop the spread<br />\nf- -.nuclear capability, but is also creating avoidable<br />\nresentment and strain in our relations.<br /><br />\n,\u2022'.<br />\n,<br />\ni<br /><br />\nI.<br />\n4,.\\<br /><br />\nny<br /><br />\n(I<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1.....1,0 \u00b0,,v.\u201e,r<br />\nth<br /><br />\nmay 3, 1977/news-letter/page 3<br /><br />\nForeign language requirement to return?<br />\nBy'GAYLE COHEN<br />\nAll Bachelor of Arts degree candidates could be<br />\nrequired to study a foreign language through the<br />\nintertnediate,level, according to a proposal,. the Academic<br />\nCouncil will consider tomorrow night\u2014The proposal,<br />\nwhich informed sources predict will almost certainly pass,<br />\nmay be the first step in a series of course requirement<br />\nchanges.<br />\n\"There are clearly a number of things about the<br />\ncurriculum that we are interested in looking into. There<br />\nshould be a coupling of this requirement with a concerted<br />\nlook at the general goals of the education of<br />\nundergraduates,\" Dean of Undergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudies Sigmund R. Suskind said. Ther proposal was<br />\nsubmitted by the Committee on Underbraduate Studies in<br />\nresponse to faoulty complaints of student illiteracy. CUS<br />\nis a subcommittee of the Academic Council which is<br />\ncomposed of five faculty and four student<br />\nmembers. \"We are constantly getting complaints from<br />\nfaculty members that students cannot write papers and<br />\nthat they c annot sit in a class and communicate their<br />\nideas clearly,\" said CUS member Charles<br />\nHenderson.<br />\nThe University dropped its foreign language<br />\nrequirement in 1968, leaving the establishment of<br />\nlanguage requirements to individual academic<br />\ndepartments. CUS member Alfredo Holt would like to<br />\nsee this arrangement maintained. \"I would prefer to have<br />\nit as it is now, wher the departments themselves set the<br />\nrequirements. I have doubts about the proposal. Certain<br />\ndisciplines do not demand it.\" He cited American political<br />\nsciences as an area that does not require knowledge of a<br /><br />\nforeign language, and mentioned that some students, such<br />\nas history of art majors, need only a specialized<br />\nvocabulary.<br />\nThe department of political economy<br />\nbecame the most recent department to omit compulsory<br />\nlanguage study when it dropped the language requirement<br />\nfor economics majors this year. \"We felt that a foreign<br />\nlanguage was not really required for undergraduate study.<br />\nThe main articles in basic theory are written in English,\"<br />\nDepartment Chairman Peter Newman said. He said he<br />\nwould perfer not to use his department to enforce a<br />\nlanguage requirement, granting the imposition of such a<br />\nrequirement to the University.<br />\nCharles Henderson, who<br />\nvoted in favor of the mandatory language study, said, \"I<br />\ndon't think it's unreasonable that students should be<br />\nconversant in a foreign language.\" He suggested that<br />\nadvisors from individual departments direct students to<br />\nenroll in non-required, but useful, courses.<br />\n\"I was<br />\nunder the general impression that neither the English or<br />\nWriting Seminars department was prepared to undertake a<br />\nlanguage skills development program, but I'd like to see a<br />\nbasic writing course/offered.\" He mentioned that by<br />\nstudying a foreign language, students will learn at least the<br />\nrudiments of grammar.<br />\nNo Guidelines<br />\nAs submitted to the Academic<br />\nCouncil, the CUS proposal lacks clear administrative<br />\nguidelines. It has no provisions for exempting students<br />\nthrough their performance on tests. It also fails to take<br />\ninto account possible growth in the language departments<br />\nand- increased use of language laboratory facilities.<br /><br />\nLimits planned for Hopkins- Peabody co-op<br />\nBy ROBERT RIGGS<br />\nUnder a dozen Johns Hopkins students will be<br />\npermitted to take courses at Peabody in September under<br />\nan \"informal agreement,\" according to Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate and Graduate Studies Sigmund R.<br />\nSuskind. In conjunction with Associate Dean of- the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory Tinka Knopf, Suskind has worked<br />\nout an \"unofficial mechanism\" for allowing Hopkins<br />\nstudents to enroll in undergraduate courses at Peabody,<br />\nand Peabody undergraduates to take courses at<br />\nHopkins. Selection of this small group of students will<br />\ntake place in the near future on a \"strictly individual<br />\nbasis,\" according to Suskind. Private instrumental lessons<br />\nwill not be available, but these students will be able to<br />\ntake music area courses such as Theory and History of<br />\nMusic, if they have enough background to pass a<br />\nplacement test. No additional tuition will be charged,<br />\nSuskind said.<br />\nThe exchange remains a \"non-program.\" Suskind<br />\nemphasized, until a formal academic affiliation can be<br />\nworked out. An administrative affiliation between the the<br /><br />\ntwo institutions will go into effect July 1, 1977. An<br />\nacademic affiliation would have to be be approved by the<br />\nCommittee for Undergraduate Studies and the Academic<br />\nCouncil, and probably will not be finalized until<br />\nSeptember, 1978, according to Suskind., \"There is no<br />\nagreement yet,\" he said, \"this arrangement will just give<br />\nus some idea of how things will work on a larger scale. It<br />\nhas been done and mutually set up between the two deans<br />\nto let the interested students involved get a chance to take<br />\nsome courses at the other school. It is not a formal<br />\nprogram.\" For this reason, Suskind continued, the<br />\nnumber of students involved must be kept small. \"Under<br />\na dozen\" will be selected from Hopkins, on the basis of<br />\n\"interest, relevance to programs, and ability.\" They will<br />\nbe first-rate students, and they will have to have a clear<br />\nreason why they should<br />\ntake courses at Peabody,\"<br />\nSuskind commented. Dean Knopf stated that \"a limited<br />\nnumber\" of Peabody students will be allowed to<br />\nenroll in courses at Hopkins. Thus far, only four of seven<br />\ncandidates have been selected. The criteria for Peabody<br />\nstudents to take courses at Hopkins, according to Knopf,<br />\nare combined scored of at least 1150-1?00 on the<br /><br />\nScholastic Aptitude Test and a \"demonstrated grade<br />\nrecord\" at Peabody. The main course areas in which they<br />\nhave shown interest are the Classics and Russian.<br />\nKnopf predicts the number of Peabody students<br />\npermitted to take courses at Hopkins will rise in future<br />\nyears. \"We want to see how it works out first. As we<br />\ngrow, obviously more exchange possibilities will become<br />\navailable.\" She noted that Peabody students are limited<br />\nby the rigid five-day class scheduling there, which makes<br />\nthe trip to Hopkins very difficult for many students.<br />\nFuture attendance of Hopkins studentsin Peabody<br />\nclasses an academic affiliation will be limited, Knopf<br />\nstated, by placement examinations and available space.<br />\nThere are about 350 undergraduates at Peabody, so any<br />\nmajor influx of Hopkins students could seriously damage<br />\nacademic opportunities for Peabody students. \"I've<br />\nalready had numerous phone calls from Hopkins students<br />\nwho have expressed desire to come her,\" Knopf<br />\ncontinued. \"The faculty has been fascinated by the<br />\npossibility of having Hopkins students come down here.

We'll have to wait until 1978 to see if the golden unification concept was<br />\nworth the hassle to the men in Garland Hall.<br />\n3. \"Coonskin\"--Censorship of any kind faces a heavy burden of justification.

Dante.<br /><br />\nsports editor<br />\nDavid Kraus<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\nJennifer Bishop<br /><br />\nBy THOMAS DAHLBERG<br />\nMany different sexual statuses have \"come out of thL,<br />\ncloset\" these days. The male homosexuals have come out,<br />\nand the lesbians, and promiscuity is beginning to take on<br />\nthe guise of normality. There is alot of talk about the<br />\nmale homosexuals \"rights\", some talk about lesbian<br />\n\"rights\" and there's still a little talk left (it's rarely found<br />\ndefensively necessary these days) about the \"right\" to<br />\nlet around\" without the repression of traditional<br />\n\"mores.\" Of course these \"rights\", though sometimes<br />\npolitical in the case of male homosexuals and lesbians, are<br />\noften just social \"rights\"\u2014i.e., the word \"right\" is used<br />\nloosely within contexts where what the male homosexual,<br />\nor the lesbian, or the \"sexually active\" are actually<br />\npleading for is a society where they can be what they are<br />\ncomfortably, without a sense of social failure and<br />\noppression. Gays, for example, claim that there are social<br />\nproblems attached to being gay which are extremely<br />\nimportant to them no matter how petty they seem to<br />\nothers. They plead for a destigmatized status which will<br />\nmake normal socializing possible for them. O.K. Fine. It's<br />\nall pouring \"out of the closet\" 'cause we're all nice<br />\nliberals and we done opened the door wide. And now,<br />\ndarnmit, at the end of the flood, come the virgins.<br />\nThat's right, the virgins gotta get out of the closet and<br />\ninto the streets. They have been socially disenfranchised<br />\nand they have to start fighting for their (social) \"rights.\"<br />\nMost of the following holds true for non-virgins who,<br />\nalong with many virgins, do not care for presumptuous<br />\nsocial pressure. I will discuss virgins almost exclusively<br />\nbecause I wish to dispel certain myths that surround them<br />\nin particular. The problem from a gregarious, fun-loving<br />\nvirgin's point of view is that many of the people who,<br />\nscrew are making normal socializing impossible for<br />\nhim/her. There are still plenty of women out there, for<br />\nexample, who would love to go out with alot of different<br />\nmen, have a good time talking to them, and go home to<br />\ntheir own bed sans date. Some of them are the most<br />\nparanoid people alive these days. They're getting glares<br />\nwhen they close the door leaving him on the outside,<br />\nreputation as a real bitch, and sometimes they actually get<br />\ncussed out. They don't know if they can accept an<br />\ninvitation or not anymore because they are all too often<br />\nput under pressures that they may actually consider<br />\nvulgar. They meet someone new and they don't know<br />\nwhat to think. \"Does he want to make it? Will he put the<br />\npressure on? Should I take a chance and go out with<br />\nhim?\" And since she's had too many bad experiences<br />\nalready she says \"no\"\u2014possibly to someone with perfect<br />\nmanners.<br /><br />\nAnd that brings us to the problem from a male virgin's ,<br />\npoint of view. Not only does he resent the assumptions;<br />\nand presumptions of the women who use men just a:.;<br />\nreadily as men use women, he may not be able to mak.\u20ac<br />\ncontact with the girls he'd really like to know because<br />\nthey may be operating on the assumption that he's just<br />\nanother horny bore. (They may consider this statistically<br />\nprobable in the light of their experience.) The virgin lives<br />\nin a youth culture that always has him/her guessing and<br />\nsecond-guessing about what his date or acquaintance<br /><br />\nVirgin's rights:<br /><br />\nCome out of the closet<br />\nexpects. The trouble isn't necessarily that virgins feel<br />\ncompelled to do what they don't want to do; if they're<br />\nvirgins today they're probably too strong to be serviously<br />\nbothered by the pressures\u2014they just tell whomever it is<br />\nthat they can bloody well go to hell. The trouble is that a<br />\nvirgin may want to socialize normally with members of<br />\nthe opposite sex (or whomever) who do hit the sack; they<br />\ncan handle the pressure these people may implicitly or<br />\nexplicitly apply, they just don't want to be bothered by<br />\nit.<br /><br />\nOne of the social difficulties attached to being a virgin<br />\nresides in the fact that there are all kinds of myths<br />\nsurrounding virginity (just like there are all kinds of<br />\nmyths surrounding blacks, indians, poles, etc.). These<br />\nmyths stigmatize the virgin. For example, one myth is<br />\nthat virgins are impotent or frigid. Of course some virgins<br />\nmay be impotent or frigid, and this may very well by why<br />\nthey are virgins, but there are plenty whose equipment is<br />\nin perfect operating condition and who are virgins for<br />\nreligious reasons, or moral reasons without theological<br />\ninterpretation, or, Lord knows, for health reasons.<br />\nAnother myth is that virgins are virgins because they are<br />\nundesirable and have been forced into it. Like the myth I<br />\nhave just described, this is nonsense if it is taken as a<br />\ngeneralization. There are plenty of virgins who are<br />\ngorgeous, interesting, and engaging human beings. Still<br />\nanother myth surrounding virginity is that virgins are<br />\nashamed of their bodies and sex. In many, if not most<br />\ncases, nothing could be further from the truth. The<br />\nimplicit position of many virgins as such is that sex is<br />\nvery, very good, and because they believe this they<br />\nprotect it from anything that may do it harm according to<br />\ntheir belief system about it. For example, a virgin may<br />\nbelieve that sex ought to have a certain meaning. He/she<br />\ndoes not engage in sex under certain circumstances simply<br />\nbecause he/she is insisting that sex mean such and such<br />\n(e.g., marital commitment, \"real\" love, etc.). It won't do<br />\nto adopt the ridiculous position that sex is a brute fact<br />\nwithout meaning\u2014so is language outside of the rules and<br />\nconventions that people, as rational creatures, invent for<br />\nit. Sex, like language, may take on meaning, and giving it<br />\na certain meaning may be intuited as morally ideal. There<br />\nmay be many good reasons for insisting on a certain<br />\nmeaning in sex; one of them simply being that the<br />\nindividual who does so insist cannot really enjoy sex<br />\nwithout it.<br />\nThe condition, the attitudes, and the beliefs of the<br />\nvirgin must be respected. If .we believe in behaving<br />\nrespectfully toward other minority groups we should<br />\nbehave respectfully toward virgins. There are two<br />\nconcrete proposals to make: 1) do not operate on<br />\nassumptions about virgins that may be nothing but<br />\nridiculous myths, and 2) do not operate on the<br />\nassumption that the new acquaintance, the friend or<br />\nwhomever, wants to screw just because they clearly like<br />\nand enjoy you, and/or accept a date. \"Keepa you hands<br />\noff\" unles in one way or another, you're asked.<br />\nThomas Dahlberg, a graduate student in Philosophy, did<br />\nnot say whether he was a virgin or not. We can onlY<br />\nspeculate.<br /><br />\nLetters we got lots and lots of letters<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nOn Tuesday, April 12, a panel of the Undergraduate<br />\nAcademic Ethics Board met to hear charges against a<br />\nstudent who had been accused of cheating on an<br />\nIntroductory Chemistry examination. The student pled<br />\nguilty, and was subsequently failed in the course by<br />\nrecommendation of the hearing panel.<br />\nAs Presiding Official of the hearing, I was responsible<br />\nfor making the above mentioned facts known to the<br />\nHopkins community. The following day, I personally<br />\ndelivered to Eric Garland, editor of the Friday edition of<br />\nthe News-Letter, a summary of the hearing that included<br />\nthose facts. Mr. Garland verbally assured me that this<br />\ninformation, in its original form, would be printed in the<br />\nFriday (April 15) issue of the N-L. It was not. I spoke to<br />\nMr. Garland about the deletion that same day, and he<br />\npromised to have Mike Deak, editor of the 'Tuesday<br />\nedition, include the summary that Tuesday. It was not<br />\ndone. I again contacted Mr. Garland, who graciously<br />\nshifted the blame to Mr. Deak, and 'again promised to<br />\nplace the Ethics Board's five-line insert in the next Friday<br />\nedition (April 22).<br />\nOn Friday, htere appeared a boxed insert on the<br /><br />\nbottom of page three entitled \"Ethics Board.\" What was<br />\nprinted, however, was not the simple statement that I had<br />\nsubmitted, but rather a typically irresponsible<br />\nNews-Letter comedy revue.<br />\nThis ill-founded attempt at satire, it seems, srlved only<br />\nto amuse the editorial staff of Hopkins' answel- to The<br />\nNational Lampoon, the irresponsible Friday News-Letter.<br />\nIt distresses me that the News-Letter feels free to<br />\nhandle the serious issue of academic integrity in such a<br />\nfarcical manner. At a time when academic integrity at<br />\nHopkins may be approaching its nadir, it was certainly<br />\ninappropriate and grossly irresponsible to act as you did.<br />\nClean up your act. ,<br />\nLawrence A.

The reason the statement did not appear in<br />\nTuesday's News-Letter was that there took place a<br />\nbureaucratic mix-up between the two editors that resulted<br />\nin the temporary (if not permanent) loss-of the original<br />\nstatement.<br />\nTo the editor:<br /><br />\nWe read with some dismay the article in the Friday<br />\nNews-Letter concerning the state of cinema in Baltimore.<br />\nAs regards this past spring, the Graduate Club of Johns<br />\nHopkins University presented what we felt to be a<br />\nselection of films, free to all, representative of various<br />\ntechniques, eras and cultures. Since January, three<br />\nKurosawa movies alone have been shown, as well as films<br />\nby Mizoguchi, Ozu, Renoir, Resnais, Eisenstein, Griffith,<br />\nKeaton, Von Stroheim and Clair have been screened.<br />\nFurthermore, the series will continue all summer, and for<br />\na list of future films we refer the reader to an<br />\nadvertisement which appears elsewhere in this edition of<br />\nthe News-Letter.<br />\nIt was unfortunate that Friday's article slighted such a<br />\nseries as this, and we suggest that in the future, before<br />\ngoing to Howard Community College to check out the<br />\nmovies, the staff should check across Charles St. in the<br />\nGrad Club, and in its files of Campus notes(!) for records<br />\nof our paq movies.<br />\nR.L.

The first was a pboto session in<br />\nthe Cabinet room where Jimmy Carter formally accepted<br />\nthe papers of the Woodcock delegation. This was the<br />\npanel sent to Hanoi to inquire into the MIA's and the<br />\ndiplomatic opportunities. The delegation consisted of<br />\nLeonard Woodcock, President of the United Auto<br />\nWorkers, Senator Mike Mansfield, former ambassador<br />\nCharles Yost, Mrs. Mary Wright Edelman, and<br />\nCongressman G.V. Montgomery. Everyone (press) lined<br />\nup in front of the Cabinet room door and when the lights<br />\nwere turned on (the signal to inter) we rushed in and<br />\nstarted taking pictures. They only allowed 36 seconds for<br />\nthis session\u2014the time varies for each session.<br />\nAfter this photo session, there was a press conference<br />\nin the press room with Secretary of the Interior, Cecil<br />\nAndrus, and Secretary of the Agriculture, Bob Bergland.<br />\nThey were discussing the Administration's evaluation and<br />\naction dealing with the drought experienced in the West<br />\nand Midwest. It was during this session that I had my first<br />\ncrack at the White House press. They were cocky, biting,<br />\nrude, and very effective. At first I was surprised, but then<br />\nI talked to a few of the \"old pros\". They all echoed the<br />\nsame thing\u2014it's a job, and as a job you must come to<br />\nterms with the way you approach it. It was still a little<br />\nhard for me to swallow, but my day was young.<br />\nAt the conclusion of the drought conferen z the<br />\nPePresident surprised everyone by coming in to introduce<br />\nthe Woodcock delegation. Leonard Woodcock gave a<br />\nshort speech followed by a question session. Apparently<br />\nthere were discrepancies in statements among the panel<br />\nmembers prior to the conference. This was enough to<br />\nopen the gates to a wave of questions, many openly<br />\ncynical.<br />\nI made it through these sessions in one piece, and<br /><br />\nreturned after lunch. There was going to be another photo<br />\nsession in the Oval Office with the President as he was<br />\naccepting official portfolios from some foreign<br />\nambassadors. After we marched into the Roosevelt Room<br />\nacross the hall from the Oval Office, we were informed of<br />\nthe procedure. We would be allowed in for 45 seconds of<br />\npicture taking, then about 3-5 minutes to leave and return<br />\nto the Roosevelt Room. Because of the time limit people<br />\nwere pushing and shoving. I even saw a punch thrown.<br />\nThe five ambassadors were from Austria, Chile, Kenya,<br />\nGuinea, and Swaziland. We<br />\nwere having a difficult time trying to figure out what<br />\ncountry each ambassador was from, and much to my<br />\nsurprise, one of the photographers had word sent in that<br />\nwe would appreciate a little introduction. Well, next time<br />\nwe went in and Jimmy Carter introduces the ambassador<br />\nas his good friend from Kenya. I couldn't believe it. It was<br />\nlights, camera, action, and we even added a little dialogue!<br />\nNot that I'm knocking Carter's sincerity. In fact, you<br />\ncould see the true concern and grief in his face when he<br />\nearlier spoke of the MIA's. It's just that I was naive\u2014not<br />\nthat I didn't know of the PR bullshit, but the depth and<br />\nthe strength of the PR really shook me. There I was<br />\nstanding in front of the President's desk in the Oval Office<br />\nand I felt like saying \"cut, take it from the t p, and<br />\nJimmy, do you think you could put your arm around his<br />\nshoulder this time?\" But my day still had many pages left.<br />\nAfter the photo session in the Oval Office, I went back<br />\nto the Press room, where they were preparing to begin a<br />\npress coliteLeilLe Wait Jouy Foweit. it is at tills press<br />\nconference that I felt that some members of the press<br />\nshowed poor taste and outright obnoxious manners. As an<br />\nexample, one of the 12 returned bodies from Vietnam<br />\nwas actually discovered to be an Oriental. Mondale had<br />\npersonally notified the family of the \"mistake\".(The 12<br /><br />\n_families had been given prior notice that the bodies were<br />\nbeing returned). Jody Powell did not disclose the name of'<br />\nthe family since he felt that their grief need not be<br />\ncompounded by the press' harrassment. It made sense ot<br />\nme, but reporters from all over were demanding the<br />\nfamily's name. One went far enough to threaten Powell<br />\nby saying that he would get 50 volunteers to call 10 of<br />\nthe MIA's families (this would cover all the families), and<br />\nin this way he would find the names of all 12 families. I<br />\noverheard another national reporter bragging among his<br />\ncohorts that he'd have the name that very afternoon. I<br />\ncould stand it no longer, and asked him why he wanted it.<br />\nHe threw a lot of crap about it being newsworthy, and I<br />\n. again asked why. Well, he told me how naive and young<br />\nand stupid I was, and I told him what i thought of his<br />\n\"newsworthy\" reporting. Well, one less invitation to<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nAnother matter which bothered me was the security. It<br />\nseems to me that if I had had a gun, I could easily have<br />\nsent Mr. Carter back amongst his forefathers. Admittedly,<br />\n1 had had a Secret Service clearance, but all the<br />\ninformation was Oven over the phone. I'm not saying I<br />\ncould get away with it, but what about the person willing<br />\nto give his life to bring the spotlight to his cause? But, as<br />\nI've learned, the side order for democracy is exposure.<br />\nAll in all, I had a great time and was both impressed<br />\nand irritated with the press. I can't help but think that a<br />\nlittle respect might go a long way. It's true that the press<br />\nmust analyze its information critically, but must they<br />\nobtain it inconsiderately? Perhaps I've singled out the<br />\nexceptions, and maybe in my nervousness they made a<br />\nstronger impression. Whatever, I've learned there's an<br />\nawful lot that goes on behind the newspapers we read<br />\neach day we wouldn't write home to Mother about.<br />\nBarry Muradian'<br /><br />\nStudent, defend thyself:Get those shoeracks<br />\nBY DAVE DE SMITH<br />\nVisitors to our Johns<br />\nhopkins campus see a group of nice buildings and lawns,<br />\nseemingly secure. The fortresses of Garland and Barton<br />\nHalls defy entry by any criminal;besides, everything at<br />\nHopkins has a lock. It must be remembered, however,<br />\nthat no placein ilaltimore is totally secure, even Hopkins.<br />\nThe riff-raff that all too often make.theirpresence felt in<br />\nthis city are not really kept off campus. Hopkins has not,<br />\nand probably will not,decide to become more isolationist,<br />\nmore protective, unless force to. Since the university<br />\nhas adopted the \"good neighbor\" policy instead of<br />\nerecting thirty-foot\" fences, anyonce erecting 30-foot<br />\nfences, anyone can walk on campus. Even before<br />\nHopkins' annual open house, many non-students were<br />\nknown to be wabdering the quads of Homewood.<br />\nCoupled with open dormitory doors, this oftern leads to<br />\ntrouble. Campus police are as helpful in preventing crime<br />\nas the non-existent fences. Homewood is a well-lit<br />\ncampus; there is usually no problem seeing any criminal<br /><br />\nacts as they progress. The problem lies in the preventative<br />\nmeasures. All students were asked to keep their doors and<br />\nwindows locked when not at home. Most students have<br />\ndone so. All housemasters have been asked to keep front<br />\ndoors locked. Few are even closed before eleven o'clock.<br />\nBasement doors in the dorms<br />\nare seldom locked,<br /><br />\nCrime!<br />\nproviding easy entry and exit.<br />\nThough the campus police are trained and conduct<br />\nregular patrols of the campus, they cannot be everywhere.<br />\nWhen a situation calls for police action, the campus patrol<br />\nmust be called. They are not likely to be already on their<br />\nway.<br />\nAs most of you know, and expected, there was crime at<br /><br />\nthe Spring Fair. The mardi gras atmosphere is one which<br />\nhas encouraged _rowdiness and activity here at Hopkins,<br />\nbut one which is produced at the students' expense. By<br />\nnow you may have had time to to forget about the fair's<br />\ncrime. Or you may have veen informed by now that ,lite<br />\ninjured Hopkins undergrad wasm't hurt? the<br />\nincident stirred a lot of discussion abouttecurity and the<br />\nvalue of the Spring Fair itself. If we must put \"3400 On<br />\nStage.\" we'd better be more prepared. The time to Make<br />\ncertain that security is working is before it has a chance to<br />\n'fail, as it did at the fair. If our university insists on<br />\ncreating potentially dangerous situations on our own<br />\ncampus without providing adequate protection, it is time<br />\nto have a'talk with the universiyt. That we do not have<br />\nlocking gences is okay, as long as we remember how to<br />\nbuild them. Above all, don't despair. Hopkins is as safe as<br />\nyou can get in Baltimore, and if this article has mad e any<br />\nstudents uncomfortable in their dorm room,look in your<br />\ncloset.

Prologue<br />\nNevertheless if anarchy is to be avoided, the individuals<br />\nwho make up a society mustj<br />\nfrom time to time be<br />\nreminded, at least in symbol, of the underlying order that<br />\nis supposed to guide their social activities. Ritual<br />\nperformances have this function for the participation<br />\ngroup as a whole; they momentarily make explicit what is<br />\nothe ise a iction. \u2014Edmund Le<br /><br />\nI'm getting old. The youthful elasticity that permitted.<br />\npositions of sexual derring-do has gone taut, and every<br />\nnow as I write (stretched on a lumpy motel bed in King of<br />\nPressia, Pa., the Willy Loman of bigtime college golf) my<br />\nlumbar feels like lumber and my ulcer burns with<br />\nunrequited desire I can no longer hope to consummate.<br />\nJust moments ago, the sight of a cocktail waitress'<br />\nbobbing boobs did not send my heart a pitter-patter. My<br />\nbusiness associates exchanged what Victorian novelists<br />\ncalled \"knowing glances\" I<br />\nthat left<br />\nmy head with a dull migraine ache. What's that stupid old(<br />\njtike? \"You're only as old as the girls you feel?\" I longh<br />\nfor the solitariness of the motel room and a quick game of<br />\ntelevision roulette before retiring to the land of the<br />\nSandman. Yes, I suppose I'm getting on in years and I<br />\nhave only the memories of happier days to content<br />\nmyself.<br />\n\"You'll remember this night for ever,\" my mother<br />\nwhispered while adjusting my collar and stuffing my pants<br />\npocket with Maalox tablets<br />\nVisions of dread ease into my consciousness. It's the<br />\nnight of my Senior Prom. Happier days? If one consider<br />\nhappiness a relative function, I suppose so. Besides, The<br />\nHoneymooners is over, and now the Silver Savior, Rex<br />\nHumbard, has taken control with his Holiday Inn concept<br />\nof the Great Beyond. Reluctantly I make the decision,<br />\nand now I slip a quarter into the slot on the headboard<br />\nand as the bed starts to vibrate, I remember----<br /><br />\nof ritual (as anthropologists, the voyeurs of academia, call<br />\nit) than just sexual silliness. There must be some method<br />\nto this madness of tuxedoes, corsages, etiquette briefings,<br />\nappointments with hairstylists (Adam and Eve's \"We<br />\ncut both ways\" \u2014 offered special prom discounts),<br />\nsleepless nights of worry, the careful clipping of toe and<br />\nfingernails<br />\nthe inventory of such acts makes my mind<br />\nshudder with embarrassment. What a foolish young blade<br />\nI was!<br />\nThe scene: A deserted country road somewhere in<br />\ncentral New Jersey. It is an evening in mid-April and five<br />\nhigh school seniors sit inside a 1972 Mustang drinking<br />\nwhiskey and rye and, knowing that Prom Day will be the<br />\nday they die, are getting blown away.<br />\nMyself: Hey, don't knock masturbation. It's sex with<br />\n;omeone you love.<br />\nHarold Nunamachr: What a case of meglomania!<br />\nFred Glaubinger: (Holding fingers to nose) Who di,<br />\nthat?<br />\nGorilla Muldoon: He who smellt it dealt it.<br />\n\"One Night Stan\" Wertheimer: Speaking of which, are<br />\nyou still planning to take Mary Lou Hooper to the prom?<br />\nFred: If she ever crawla out from under her rock-Myself: You want a knuckle sanwich, Glaubinger?<br />\nFred: Yeah, and hold the mayo,crater face.<br />\nHarold: -I tried to cop a feel off Audrey Sedlek<br />\nSaturday night<br />\nGorilla: Audrey Sedlek tried to feel a cop Saturday<br />\nnight?<br />\nFred: Did you know that E.J. Korvettes stands for<br />\nEleven Jewish Korean War Vets?<br />\nMyself: Mary Lou Hooper's not much to look at, but<br />\nshe sure is a whiz at geometry.<br />\nStan: You hear the one about the American<br />\nbusinessman in Tokyo<br />\nI was lying to the guys I hadn't even asked Mary Lou<br />\nyet, let alone even gone out on a date with her. Put a few<br />\njiggers of Jim Beam in me and I'm likely to tell all. So the<br />\nnext morning I woke with a headache and an obligation<br />\nto ask Mary Lou to the prom. It wasn't going to be a<br />\npiece of cake, but at least I could try. And if I failed...<br />\nI'm convinced the Clint Eastwood sunglasses did the<br />\ntrick. I sauntered up to her table in the cafeteria wearing<br />\nmy tightest t-shirt, and without gulping, asked her for a<br />\ndate that Friday night, a scant two weeks before the<br />\nprom. She looked dreamily at me with those marbles I<br />\ncthink were her eyes and the words<br />\ncame out on<br />\nangel's breath, \"I'd love to!\" I'd by to. Christ, I could've<br />\nwet my pants. Luckily I made my escape by squeaking<br />\nout a lie, \"Excuse me, but I have a reservation to use the<br />\nweight room,\" which she accepted with that crinkle of a<br />\ngrin I soon learned to treasure.<br />\nLet me draw a picture of Mary Lou Hooper. Better,<br />\nhcre's her yearbook picture.<br /><br />\nby Mike Deak<br /><br />\n3. Why do<br />\nHummingbirds<br /><br />\nrs,<br />\nWho walks these locker-covered halls? Tradition, as Tevye<br />\nwould shout to the multitude. Tradition in the form of<br />\nthe ghosts of the innumerable illuminaries Somerville<br />\nHigh has given to the world. Here comes the most famous,<br />\nPaul Robeson, a man who needs no introduction and first<br />\nperformed Othello on the auditorium stage; also in show<br />\nbiz, Lee Van Cleef, a distant cousin by a great aunt, the<br />\nprince of spaghetti westerns; and a hearty top of the<br />\nmorning to those handsome boys in Varsity Club jackets,<br />\nCharley Winner, ex-coach of the New York Jets, and Joe<br />\nLis, platoon first baseman for the Seattle Mariners; and<br />\nfinally (the list has to end sometime) there's Gentleman<br />\nRay Bateman, favorite to defeat OTB (\"One Term<br />\nByrne\") in this year's gubernatorial race. With such<br />\nmodels, no wonder we thought the world was our oyster<br />\nand only the sky was the limit.<br />\nWe looked forward to the Senior Prom as eagerly as the<br />\nnatives of Capistrano look to the return of the swallows.<br />\nExactly why I don't know. Why do hummingbirds hum<br />\nVanity of vanities, the old ecclesiastical saying goes, the<br />\nrites of spring, Sioutfir, beauty, and virility. Unfortunately<br />\nI was familiar with none of the above, so I saw the prom<br />\nas a golden fleece of an opportunity to legitimize The Big<br />\nScore, the respectable and socially acceptable deflowering<br />\nof that bubbly tulip I had trained my beady little eyes on<br />\never since she moved here from Ho Ho Kus in seventh<br />\ngrade, the effervescent, ever lubricous Mary Lous Hooper.<br />\nThere must be something more to this native's model<br /><br />\nVisions of<br />\nranges and<br />\ne gnoirs<br /><br />\nMary Lou's on the left, and the other two mugs happen to<br />\nbe Stan Wertheimer and Isabel Horowitz who were our<br />\ndoubledate for the prom. If the phrase \"bottom of the<br />\nbarrel\" occurs to you, please be kind and remember that<br />\nbeauty is in the eye of the beholder, and, goddamit, we<br />\nwere desperate.<br />\nMix two parts memory and three parts desire and you'll<br />\nknow why Eliot called April the cruellest month. That<br />\nFriday came faster than Linda Lovelace (a little teenage<br />\nhumour, very little in fact) and I was a prime contender in<br />\na Maxwell Smart incompetency contest. I cut myself<br />\nshaving with an electric raxor, wore my underwear inside<br />\n,out, singed my scalp with my hot comb, and so on. I<br />\nconned my brother into lending me his jalopy, a<br />\nzooped-up '69 Cougar with its nose stuck up in the air<br />\nlike a blue-blooded Ivy Leaguer, which prompted Mr.<br />\nHooper to sarcastically chortle, \"When does the<br />\ncountdown begin, space cadet?\"<br />\n\"Wilbur,\" Mrs. Hooper screeched, \"remember your<br />\nmanners. Mike's our guest, you know.\" \"<br />\n\"Just joshin' son,\" h replied with a kind-hearted<br />\npunch on the shoulder that sent me groveling towards the<br />\ngutter.<br />\n\"Now you have Mary Lou back before midnight,\" Mrs.<br />\nHooper waved a matronly finger, \"she needs her beauty<br />\nsleep.\"<br />\n\"She better take an overdose of sleeping pills if that's<br />\ntrue,\" her younger brother Herb Hooper hissed.<br />\n\"How you like one 'cross your lips?\" Mr. Hooper<br />\nthreatened with his. Red Foxx impression.<br />\n\"Take care you two,\" her mother shouted as we drove<br />\naway,\"I know how I was when I was you age.\"<br />\n\"Parents,\" Mary Lou said with that french fry smile.<br />\n\"Yeah, parents,\" I replied, a graduate of the Gary<br />\nCooper School of Witty Conversation, summa cum lousy.<br />\nI suppose all these allusions to movie stars<br />\nunconsciously reveal the role flicks played in my<br />\neducation of social behavior outside the family. I think it<br />\nwas also Edmund Leach who said that myth and ritual<br />\nwere one and the same, or t least in merican culture,<br />\ntry to be. But enough of the theory. I took Mary Lou to<br /><br />\ndni<br />\nthe last remaining Jerry lewis Cinema in New JerseY<br />\nI<br />\npet<br />\nits<br />\nin<br />\n\"Frenzy,\"<br />\na<br />\nfilm<br />\nthat<br />\nHitchcock's<br />\nAlfred<br />\nway I th ught would set a romantic mood. And indeeivent<br />\ndid, as with the first shot of a naked corpse floating'\"\u201e01<br />\nThames, her hand jumped into mind and stayed there<br />\nqtas<br />\nrest of the movie.<br />\n\"Wasn't that a good movie,\" I said driving to the at ofn<br />\nYork Inn in Raritan, an infamous local hangout who:<br />\nare not required if you slip the bouncer a buck. ri rchl<br />\nknow,\" she replied in a bashful tone,\"I don't like iv\u00b0 Ito e.<br />\nti<br />\nthat scare you.\"<br />\n\"But it's only a movie, it's only a strip of caul Lik(<br />\npassing before a light bulb, it's not even human...\" leke ca<br />\n1t1S1<br />\n\"Well, let's not argue about it,\" Mary Lou said, :<br />\n4 an<br />\nhave a goodtime \"'<br />\n\"We'll have a pitcher of Rheingold,\" I told the yva:It1 Und<br />\nari<br />\nin my eighteen year old voice impression (I was,d qartt<br />\n'<br />\nseventeen and a half and only God knows how old<br />\nLou was.)\"You like beer?\"<br />\n\"I don't know,\" she sighed, \"I've never had any.

Had I committed some social faux<br />\nwas she merely submitting to her primitive animal u<br />\nto let me take her in one glorious swoop and slie<br />\nmerely helping the situation along? I never knew, bd,<br />\nat that instant, Gorilla Muldoon dropped by with his s<br />\nances Tooty, and together they drank three-quarter<br />\nthe pitcher, and I had the other quarter, and MatY4<br />\njust sat there silently smiling and laughing when reci\"/<br />\nI wiped my mouth on my sleeve and coree<br />\nsuggested to Tooty and Muldoon, \"I think it's tiro (ji<br />\nhave to go.\" And we all got up and walked out t\u00b0<br />\nparking lot, said our goodbyes, and departed in oPP<br />\ndirections, Tooty and Muldoon off to North 131<br />\nwh re neither one lived (but where there was this ribi<br />\nlittle spot, you see, off Burnt Mills Road,....) and we<br />\nthrough Raritan to Somerville and home.<br />\n#<br />\n\"Well, we're home,\" I turned off one engine '<br />\n5'<br />\nfiguratively on another, \"did you have a good time?'')<br />\n'<br />\ne<br />\nShe looked at me with that glazed look in her eY,<br />\nwas the best time I've had this year,\" she whispere'to<br />\nthis a cue?

I was completely numb, as if the<br />\nritiSt had overdose me on Novacaine. I got out of the<br />\n.0 and looked up to the sky and, as my habit still is,<br />\nv\"nd On n and traced the figure of the hunter pointing<br />\n5 arrow at men.s souls. I regained feeling and was<br />\ntantly aware of a bulge in my jeans. Till that time I'd<br />\n4sidered myself a draft doger in the war between the<br />\nkes, but now I was committed to a cause. I had fallen in<br />\ngh eA,or at least I had convinced myself<br />\nof that.<br />\n)<br />\n1it'<br />\nInd hummingbirds hum because they ,don't know<br />\ntli<br />\nords.<br />\n1/1<br /><br />\nhe<br /><br />\nis d'<br />\nteis<br /><br />\n4\u00b00'<br />\nfef<br />\nfoe t i<br />\nto<br /><br />\nos<br /><br />\night<br /><br />\nAs those great pedagogues of pederasty, Hermans<br />\nHermits, have n ted, on such a night as Prom Night<br />\nthere's a kind of hush all over the world and people just<br />\nlike us are falling in love. Falling in love.<br />\nTradition taught us that the Prom -itself was not as<br />\nimportant as what happened after the Prom. The Prom<br />\nwas just the stuffing for this turkey of a ritual. Stan and I<br />\nmade the shrewdest of plans; a quick midnight snack<br />\nafterwards at the refurbished Bridgewater Diner, and a<br />\ndrive East, to either New York, for some more partying,<br />\nor to the Shore, and a litt e rom nce. I pr ferred the<br />\nlatter; a fantasy keeping me awake nights had Mary Lou<br />\nand I cavorting on some Caribbean beach, the two of us<br />\nalone, running hand in hand as the eaves, endless waves,<br />\nlapped our ankles<br />\nWe decided to take Stan's car, a machine that had all<br />\nthe smell and color of a lemon , a 1970 Ambassador<br />\nStan's father only bought because American Motors<br />\nsponsored the Mets games on television. It wasn't the<br />\nbest-looking car; in fact Mr. Hooper remarked, \"What<br />\nhappened? The pickup have a flat tire?\"<br />\n\"Wilbur!\" Mrs. Hooper scrreched again,.'sometimes I<br />\nwonder.\".<br />\n\"Is Mary Lou ready yet?' I squawked, my necl<br />\nsqueezed by a boa constrictor of a necktie. Note of<br />\nexplanation: this was 1974 so standards of dress were<br />\nrelaxed to allow what Amy Vanderbilt calls<br />\n\"semi-formal\" attire.<br />\n\"She's busy getting plastic surgery,\" Herb sneered,<br />\n\"You better hope they don't take the bandages off till<br />\nnext week.\"<br />\n\"How would you like me to part your hair with a<br />\ncrowbar,\" Mr. Hooper shook a first at him.<br />\n\"Why Isabel, you look just like Deanna Durbin,\" lrs.<br />\nHooper praised, \"oh but you kids are too young to<br />\nremember her.\"<br />\n\"Mike, do you have protection?\" Mr. Hooper asked witl<br />\na chiseled grin.<br />\nI nodded my head, thinking of the four fiesta-colored<br />\nTrojans -- \"The Korvette of the Contraception scene\" -stuffed in my pocket along with the Maalox, and realizing<br />\nhe must have meant something else, blurted out,\"Oh yes,<br />\nAllstate. Don't worry sir, your Mary Lou will be in good<br />\nhands.\"<br />\n\"Well, just watch where you put those good hands,\" he<br />\nm cked with a wink of his left eye.<br />\nJust then Mary Lou appeared. I gasped out of surprise.<br />\nShe was actually good-looking as she, wearing a saffron<br />\ndress with a neckline that played footsie with her cleavage<br />\nand her pimples covered by so many layers of make-up I<br />\nwondered if her Avon lady could have retired to Miami<br />\nBeach on this commission, waltzed towards me.<br />\n\"You look absolutely stunning,\" I said. (\"Stunning?\"<br />\nStan whispered, \"What is he blabbering about?\" I'd<br />\nforgotten to tell him I had watched Dan Daily movies for<br />\nthe past month to gain insight into suave, sophisticated<br />\nbehavior.) \"Shall we go,\" I said taking her arm and then<br />\nturning to her parents, \"Ta-ta.\"<br />\n\"Oh Wilbur,\" Mrs. Hooper swooned, \"chivalry isn't<br />\ndead.\"<br />\n\"It's vaudeville that's dead, Hedda,\" he answered,<br />\n\"vaudeville.\"<br />\nAs we drove away, I said to Mary Lou,\"Your mother's<br />\nname isn't really Hedda, Hedda Hooper is it?\"<br />\nShe smiled that shoestring smile, \"Parents.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, parents,\" I replied. Tht evening was off to a<br />\ngreat start.<br />\nMartinsville Inn sits hidden somewhere in the Watchung<br />\nMoutains north of Bound Brook, and Stan, ever the<br />\nclown, put lead in his foot and tok the dangerous hairpin<br />\ncurves at near fifty. \"It's macho,\" he explained to our<br />\ndates.<br />\n\"It's not macho anything,' Isabel laughed like a<br />\nlooney and inched over towards Stan. A feeble smile<br />\ntwitched my lips as Mary Lou slinked towards me. What<br />\nhappened next was a case of bad fate. The moment her<br />\nhand landed on mine in a tight clench of safety, I sneezed,<br />\nand instinctively, brought my :hand up to my mouth with<br />\nher hand coming along for the ride. It was a particularly<br />\nbrothy sneeze and I was at a loss of words. \"I didn 't get<br />\nyour hand wet, did I?\" And she shook her head, and took<br />\nher hand away to adjust her corsage. When she wasn.t<br />\nlooking, I wiped my hand on the car seat, not wishing to<br />\ndig into my pocketful of miracles for a hankie.<br />\nThe theme for the Prom was \"Guys and Dolls,\" but<br />\nnobody could tell it from the sleazy rock band, a bunch<br />\nof local punks called \"The Wild Strawberries,\" who didn't<br />\nknow \"Fugue for Tinhorns\" from \"Stairway to Heaven\"<br />\nThe Decorations Committee had been hit with a case of<br />\nmono and, consequently, there was a notable lack of<br />\ndecorations, so it didn't really seem like a Prom. But our<br />\nhearts did not despair; we were rebellious children,<br />\ncontemptu us of anything reeking of Tradition, th ugh<br />\nat the sale time deeply guided by the precepts of<br />\nTradition. No wonder that 5% of our class (by latest<br />\ncount) had found their way into the Crackerbox Palace.<br />\nWe were treated to the typical Martinsville Inn dinner,<br />\nthe same fare of anti-pasta, manicott, filet mignon half<br />\nbaked potatoes, and vanilla ice cream with \"sprinkles,\"<br />\nmy father's lkowling league banquet had. But the food<br />\nwas washed down by .a special presentof the Faculty Club,<br />\nglasses of slightly foxy Cold Duck that made our tongues<br />\nthe lucid instrume ts of witty execution one ;would<br />\nexpect of the Three Stooges at a debutante ball.<br />\n\"With the amount of Christians around here,\"<br />\nrem rked Murray Rabinowitz, the class valedictorian and<br />\nalso headed for Hopkins,\"they should call this 'Goys and<br /><br />\nDills.'\"<br />\n\"Did you know what you are, Murray?' I gal...Tied.<br />\n\"you're a J.A.P., a Jewish-American Poet.\" Mary Lou's<br />\nlaughter shrilled in my ear, \"Goodness woman, are you<br />\ntrying to make me another Norm Crosby?\" which only<br />\nelicited more laughter.<br />\nStan had been nibbling on Isabel's ear for the last half<br />\nhour while Mary Lou and I boogied on the dance floor.<br />\nWe hardly ,got within two feet of each other and our eyes<br />\nconcentrated' roo much on each other's movements to<br />\nhave any meaningful contact. And after we danced, we<br />\ndrank and the hours flew by without our t noticing and<br />\nthe 'band. was playing \"Rikki, Don't I Lose That<br />\n'Number' for the fifth time when Stan and Isabel briefly<br />\ninterrupted their ear-nibbling and suggested we move on.<br />\nIt was quarter to three and neither of us really cared, the<br />\nCold Duck had taken control, and Mary and I were busy<br />\nexchanging life histories. \"Ah but I was born with a cleft<br />\npalate and a harelip. Top that!\"<br />\ni\"My sister died of leukemia,' she replied. It was the<br />\nonly serious moment of the night and somebody turned<br />\noff the lights, a situation 4 j. took advantage of by<br />\nsnuggling .up and giving her a kiss slightly more \"mature\"<br />\nthan the one in the car. The lights came back on, and the<br />\nprom was'oyer, and I felt as if nothing had happened, as if<br />\nthe Prom was just a big fake, a dreadful hallucination. I<br />\ndidn't feel any differently, and I was sober enough to<br />\nrealize all the trauma had gone for naught.<br />\nThe coup d' grace. Once back in the car, Stan slipped<br />\nthe secret weapon out of his pocket, a big fat joint<br />\nwrapped in pink paper. \"How you young ladies like to<br />\nget a case of reefer madness?\" he gurgled.<br />\nThey were too far gone to offer any idealistic resistance<br />\nso the joint, like country doctor, made its rounds.<br />\n\"Stan,\" I shouted. \"You just went through a stop sign.<br />\nYou want us get thrown in the klinker? Don't you know<br />\nwhat stopitneans?\"<br />\n\"Squeal tires on .'ilavement?\" and bellowed with that<br />\ninsidious laughter. I grabbed t .joint my Mary Lou who<br />\nhad been fondling it for . thd past five minutes and<br />\nimmediately burned my firer. The joint fell to the floor,<br />\nand out of anger, my foot fell on the joint, and that was<br />\nthat. We were now headed east on Route 22, an asphalt strip<br />\nof decadent commercialism which lead to the small<br />\n_scatter point graph of lights in the distance of New York<br />\n\"Where are we going?\" Mary Lou<br />\n\"Did you know that Mery Griffin sang What a Lovely<br />\nHunch ot Cocoanuts' when he Was with Freddy Martin in<br />\n1949?\" I replied, my mind on other than the obvious.<br />\n',You're so kooky,\" she sighed, and rested her head on<br />\nmy shoulder.<br />\n.\"Kooky, kooky, lend me your comb,\" I ditted and<br />\ngently stroked her hair. We were almost to Springfield<br />\nwhere the highway splits and. Stan was speeding along,<br />\nIsabel's'hand in his lap.<br />\nI'll reme ber this night for ever,' Mary Lou<br />\npurred, \u00b0it's been so much like heaven on Earth .1 could<br />\nalmost cry.\"<br />\nLittle, did she suspect that in just a few moments she<br />\nwould plead with Stan to stop the car in the parking lot<br />\nof the 'famous flagship) so she 'could lurch to a light pole<br />\nand puke all. the food'and drink she'd had for the past<br />\nthree months. , It, was not a 'particularly pretty sight;<br />\nseeitig her dress shudder with every retch made my own<br />\nstomach grumble.<br />\n\"1 think we better bag the trip to the shore,\" I told<br />\nOtan.\"You want some Maalox, Mary Lou?\"<br /><br />\n\"Well, Somerville's not French Lick, Indiana,<br />\nwhispered to her. We were sitting in her back yard on<br />\nsome rusty lawn furniture watching the sun rise.<br />\n\"Mike, sometimes I don't understand anything you<br />\nsay,\" she smiled weakly, c`but that's why I like you so<br />\nmuch.\"<br />\n\"Visions of oranges and peignoirs, my dear,\" I replied,<br />\n\" that's what I see in you.\" My eyes lingered to the East<br />\nwhere the sun was now rising through the lowest<br />\n*branches of the catalpa tree, and all th fantasies of<br />\nMary Lou and me on the beach at Lavalette, i* ntertwined<br />\nan the sand, and lett* the first lavender sweeps of<br />\nsunl4ght brush over us. entered my mind. The mammoth<br />\nscale Of my self-delusionment suddenly became obvious<br />\nand a shr ud of sleepiness suddenly came over me.<br />\n\"I really must go,\" I said and bent over to kiss her.<br />\n\"Prase don't\" she pulled away, \"there's still vomit<br />\non my lips.\"<br />\nI remember 'little: of the walk home.

In tjie early spring, the Blue Jays<br />\nshared their limited facilities with the Orioles, with the<br />\nhighlight being Jim Palmer pitching batting practice \u2014 a<br />\ntask he doesn't perform for his own team. The Jays have<br />\ndisplayed prowess at the plate, but despite that have been<br />\ninconsistent in the field. When they play errorless ball<br />\nthey have been worthy of their national ranking and have<br />\nbeen invincible.<br />\nLast Saturday, though, the team's limitations came to<br />\nthe forefront as a giant-killing Swarthmore team helped<br />\nthe Jays ease into a co-championship with the Widener<br />\n'Millionaires' in the MAC Southeastern division.<br />\nThe action really began Friday when the ball team<br />\ntraveled to Franklin &amp; Marshall to meet the champs of the<br />\nWestern division of their bracket of the MAC in what<br />\nshould have been a preview of the playoffs. The clawing<br />\nBlue Jays wok an easy game from a solid opponent<br />\nleading most of the game by three or four runs.<br />\nThe final tally was 6-4 with the batting hero senior Bob<br />\nBabb who stroked a home run out of the Lancaster, Pa.<br />\nstadium on the second pitch of the hame. Also<br />\ncontributing were Rick Law, whose offense of late has<br />\nbeen impressive, and Frank Parreira, who is climbing<br />\ntowards the .400 mark in hitting.<br />\nJason Sussman's strongest pitching of the year baffled<br />\nF&amp;M until he tired after seven and gave way to relievers<br />\nBurns and Parreira who picked up the save. The team's<br />\ndefense was excellept throughout the contest.<br />\nSaturday, the Jays split a doubleheader with the<br />\nSwarthmore Garnet. Hopkins should have handled the<br />\nvisitors with relative ease, especially , after their<br />\ndestruction of athletic powerhouse F&amp;M.<br />\nThe game began as it should have ended. After two of<br />\nthe first three men to face the Garnet hurler walked,<br />\ntimely clean-up hitter Dave Lewing cracked a double<br />\ngiving the home Jays a 2-0 lead.<br />\nBur 'OK pitching' from the visitors' best man, seven<br />\nwhopping err ors by our defense, and a partisan<br /><br />\nSwarthmore crowd on Hopkins' own field combiOd to<br />\ngive the visitors an inspired 8-5 first game victory<br />\nOn the mound for JH, Mike Santo pitched valiantly but<br />\nhis sore shoulder prevented him from completing the<br />\ngame. Mike's exit paved the way for a Swarthmore revival<br />\nand 4 run outburst in the 6th of seven innings. Hopkins<br />\ncountered with three in their half of the inning but the<br />\nrally fell short with a man stranded on third base.<br />\nThe Blue Jays did a turnabout in the second game as<br />\nthe ace ot the staff Steffan Burns pitched a no-hitter<br />\nthrough the first out of the last inning. The final score<br />\nwas 5-2 with the bat of Brad Rosborough knocking in the<br />\nwinning runs. Rosborough has consistently gone out and<br />\npummeled the other team each game he has played this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe final tote for the regular season finds the Jays as<br />\nimpressive as last year's excellent team. Junior co-captain<br /><br />\nDave Emala has established himself as one of the finest<br />\nhitters in the country at any level. Senior co-captain Bob<br />\nBabb who has played outstanding defensively also leads<br />\nthe team in numerous offensive departments.<br />\nOutfield leader Dave Lewing and undefeated pitchers<br />\nSteffan Burns and Jason Sussman are the only other<br />\nreturning veterans from last year's team who will be back<br />\nnext year as only two seniors are departing.<br />\nAlso returning will be outstanding forst year men<br />\nFrank Parreira, Mike Santo, Brad Rosborough and at least<br />\nfour other starters. This group unlike the Widener-styee<br />\nrecruits are going to school while they win ballgames.<br />\nThe 15-6 Blue Jays will face off with Widener this<br />\nweekend in a play-off for the right to play Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall, with the winner of the F&amp;M game representing<br />\nthe Southern Division of the MAC in the NCAAplayoffs.<br /><br />\nCoekey trackers perform consistently well<br />\nDespite a 5-6 Fecord so far this spring, the Blue Jay<br />\ntrack learni has performed consistently well and has<br />\nestablished several new university' records.<br />\nThese new Hopkins standards include Jim Kennedy's<br />\n14:15.6 in the three-mile run and Bob Freamon's 4:19.3<br />\nin the one-mile race. Not only do these times represent<br />\nnew school records, but they are also the top<br />\nperformances this year in the MAC.<br />\nHowever, an overall lack of team depth has been deadly<br />\nfor the JHU thinclads. Success in track competition is<br />\ndifficUlty with'a small squad and the Jays' meet record<br />\nseems to bear this contention out.<br />\nOn April 12, the Blue Jays travelled to Lebanon Valley<br />\nCollege to participate in a three-way meet between<br />\nthemselves, their hosts and Washington College. When the<br />\ndust had finally cleared, Lebanon Valley had amassed<br />\n102.5 points, JHU had garnered 58 points and<br /><br />\nWashington had come across with only 20.5 points.<br />\nThe strength of the Hopkins effort was concentrated in<br />\nthe running events. Speedster Matt McLin, a freshman<br />\nfrom Hanover, Pal, showed the way in the sprint events.<br />\nplacing second in both the 110- and 220- yard dashes.<br />\nThe Jays literally ran away from the rest of the field in<br />\nthe distance run events. In the 880, Bob Alworth topped<br />\nthe field, while Tom Kepple and Bob Safier finished<br />\nfourth and fifth respectively. The one-mile run saw a JHU<br />\nsweep of the top three spots, with Freamon, Kennedy and<br />\nTim Whitcombe coming across the finish line in that<br />\norder. The ending of the three-mile also looked lixe a<br />\nmass gathering of Blue Jays, with Kennedy, Freamon and<br />\nWhitcombe finishing one, two, four.<br />\nOn April 16, the team travelled to Haverford for a meet<br />\nthat Head Coach Randy Cockey later called \"the low<br />\npoint of the season.\" The Jays were missing several key<br /><br />\nperformers and ended up losing to their hosts, 77-68,<br />\nwhen Haverford captured the final event (the mile relay)<br />\nby less than one second!<br />\nSenior-. Brett Miles and sprinter McLin led the Jay<br />\neffort at Haverford, as each mani captured first place<br />\nhonors in a pair of events. Miles was the top man in both<br />\nthe long jump and the triple jump, while Matt won the<br />\n110.: and 220- yard dashes.<br />\n\"The loss of those men really hurt us,\" Cockey<br />\ncommented.\"The team that was there pulled very hard to<br />\novercome our deficiencies, but we couldn't quite do it.\"<br />\nOn May 19, the team travelled up the road to Towson<br />\nState for a series of dual' meets\u2014one against Towson and<br />\none versus UMBC. Both of these opponents have excellent<br />\ntrack programs, so despite two losses (84-60 to Towson<br />\nand 87-55 to UMBC), Coach Cockey was extremely<br />\npleased with the squad's performance.<br />\n\"It was a fantastic team effort,\" the Coach noted,<br />\n\"especially from the distance men.\"<br />\nHe was referring specifically to Kennedy and Freamon,<br />\nboth of whom excelled in this competition.<br />\nFreamon established his record in this meet, while<br />\nKennedy took the 3-mile event in 14:15.1, a school<br />\nrecord at the time.<br />\nThat record lasted exactly four days, as Jim shattered<br />\nthat mark with his effort at a three-way meet against<br />\nDickinson and Ursinus on April 23. Kannedy took the<br />\n3-mile event in an incredible 15:15.6, tying the Dickinscji<br />\ntrack record and qualifying him for the national<br />\nchampionships later this month.<br />\nKennedy's effort, 'combine&amp; with double victories<br />\nfrom McLin (\"the fastest sprinter at JHU in the last three,<br />\nyears\" according to Cockey) and Freamon enabled the<br />\nJays to ctitim a pair of victories on this day.<br />\nOn April 26, Hopkins hosted a three-way meet that<br />\nincluded Western Maryland and Loyola. Despite a pair of<br />\nwins from Freamon and an impressive effort from the<br />\nrelay teams;, the best that the Jays could do was to finish<br />\nin the middle, ahead of Loyola but trailing W. M.<br /><br />\nIn the unfortunate 12-11 loss to Cornell earlier this<br />\nseason, the Blue Jay stickmen seemed to lose their<br />\ncomposure after allowing a large lead to shrink away. At<br />\nWest Point on Saturday, the Jays showed that they have<br />\nlearned from their mistake.<br />\nBattling an inspired, 11th ranked Army squad on their<br />\nhome turf, Hopkins was forced to stage a fourth-quarter<br />\nrally to defeat the Cadets, 13-8, thus running the JHU<br />\nseason mark to 7-1 and enabling the Jays to hold onto<br />\ntheir third-place ranking in the coaches' poll.<br />\nThe Jays had opened the second half with a 5-1<br />\nadvantage and seemed set to roll over their adversaries.<br />\nHowever, Army came roaring on in the third quarter,<br />\noutscoring the Jays 5-2 in that session and trailing by only<br />\na single goal as the teams entered the final fifteen minutes<br />\nof play.<br />\nThe Cadet comeback was led by the phenomenal<br />\ngoaltending of Jose Olivero. While his teammates were<br />\npumping five goals into the Blue Jay net, Olivero was a<br />\nveritable fortress on defense. In the third period alone,<br />\nthe junior netminder made twelve saves as JHU<br />\ncould<br />\nconnect on only 2 of 22 shots.<br />\nHopkins scored in the first minutes of the<br />\nfourth<br />\nquarter to take an 8-6 lead, but Army kept comin<br />\ng. The<br />\nhome team tallied twice in succession to forge<br />\nan 8-8<br />\ndeadlock with less than ten minutes remaining<br />\nin the<br />\ncontest.<br /><br />\nAt this juncture of the game, Army Coach<br />\nDick Edell<br />\ncalled a time - out, a move that puzzled Jay<br />\nCoach Henry<br />\nCiccarone.<br />\n\"It (calling a time-out) surprised me,\"<br />\nthe JHU mentor<br />\nsaid. \"They had the momentum then\u2014<br />\nI was about to call<br />\na time-out, but he beat me to it.\"<br />\nCiccarone explained that the time-out<br />\nenabled his team<br />\nto regroup. Evidently this regrouping was<br />\nquite successful,<br />\nfor the Jays went back onto the<br />\nfield and totally<br />\ndominated play in the game's final minut<br />\nes, outscoring<br />\nthe Cadets 5-0.<br />\nJoe Garavente broke the tie two minutes<br />\nlater, taking a<br />\nfeed from Mike O'Neill and whipping<br />\nthe ball past<br />\nOlivero. That score was quickly followed<br />\nby goals from<br />\nDave Huntley and Bob Maimone, giving JHU an<br />\n11-8 lead<br />\nwith six minutes to play and sealing the victory.<br />\nAfter the game, Ciccarone revealed that the<br />\ngame,<br />\nstatistically speaking, had gone pretty much as<br />\nhe had<br />\nexpected. \"I figured that if we shot 65 times, we<br />\nwould<br />\nscore 15-18 goals,\" the Coach noted. \"I<br />\nalso was<br />\nconfident that our defense could hold them to under<br />\nten<br />\ngoals.\" Chic attribured his team's lower score (despi<br />\nte 73<br />\nshots) to Oliver's efforts, pointing out that the<br />\nArmy<br />\nnetminder \"made saves that kept us from blowi<br />\nng it<br />\nopen.\"<br />\nO'Neill, Huntley and Rich Hirsch were the leader<br />\ns on<br />\noffense for Hopkins as each player was credited<br />\nwith four<br /><br />\npoints. O'Neill had a goal and three assists<br />\nwhile Huntley<br />\ncontinued his year-long shooting spree with<br />\nfour goals.<br />\nThe continued fine effort from Hirsch (the<br />\nsenior<br />\nattackman had five points a week ago) is an<br />\nexcellent sign<br />\nas the team readies for its toughest month of<br />\nthe season.<br />\nThe Long Island native and four-year starter did<br />\nnot play<br />\nwell through the first part of the season and<br />\nhis return to<br />\nform could remove some of the burden<br />\nfrom his<br />\nteammates on attack. \u2022<br />\nIn this next two weeks, the Jays will face the<br />\nnumber<br />\nfour and the number two team in<br />\nthe country,<br />\nrespectively. This Saturday, JHU entertains Navy<br />\nwhile on<br />\nMay 14, Hopkins travels to College Park<br />\nto face the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland.<br />\nThe top eight teams in the country will then<br />\nparticipate<br />\nin the NCAA play-offs to determine<br />\nthe national<br />\nchampion. Round I is scheduled to be<br />\nplayed on<br />\nWednesday May 17, while Round 2 is to be<br />\nheld on<br />\nSaturday May 21. The two survivors will meet on<br />\nMay 28<br />\nat Charlottesville, Virginia for the Division<br />\nI national<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nAlthough the final is played at a pre-determin<br />\ned site,<br />\nthe first two rounds are contested at the home field<br />\nof the<br />\nhigher ranked of the two teams, and therefore Ciccar<br />\none<br />\ncalls both the Navy and Maryland games \"crucial\".<br />\n\"We need to win them both to make our own<br />\ndestiny<br />\nin the play-offs,\" Ciccarone concluded.<br /><br />\nBaby Jays rack up fourth straight victory<br />\nWith victories in its last four games, the Blue<br />\nJays<br />\nmen's Junior Varsity Lacrosse teem has moved its<br />\nrecord<br />\nto 5-3, marking the first time the team has been above<br />\nthe<br />\n.500 level all season.<br />\nThe Junior Jays are coached by Bert Mandelbaum<br />\n,a<br />\nPhD student at the Med School.
