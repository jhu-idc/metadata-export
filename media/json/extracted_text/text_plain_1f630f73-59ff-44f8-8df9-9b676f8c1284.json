It not only marked the<br />\ntwenty-fifth birth-day of the University, but<br />\nwitnessed, with regrets, the resignation of the<br />\nfirst and only president of the institution.<br />\nThe attention of the public, which has been<br />\nrecently turned upon Johns Hopkins on account of our newly acquired possessions, also<br />\ncontributed to gather the illustrious assemblage which makes the day a memorable one.<br />\nThe one thing, however, which remained to<br />\ndistinguish the day in the annals of the University, and to mark the beginning of a new<br />\nepoch of unprecedented success, was wanting.<br />\nStudents, faculty, and friends alike waited with<br />\nhopeful expectation to hear the announcements<br />\nfrom \"Uncle Dan,\" but the all important one,<br />\nthe one which all had 'anxiously awaited,<br />\nbrought only disappointment. Let us all,<br />\nlike Uncle Dan, \"have faith in the people,<br />\nfaith in human nature.\"<br />\nAnother subject for surmise among the<br />\naudience was the probable successor of President Gilman. One or two newspapers have<br />\ninsinuated that Dr. David J. Hill, the orator<br />\nof the day, may be the man, but thus far,<br />\nnothing definite has been learned. The ovation given Dr. Hill at the conclusion of his<br />\nspeech, by friends and students alike, plainly<br />\nattests the favorable impression which he<br />\nmade. His address was both eloquent and<br />\nscholarly, and his personality plainly indicates<br />\nthose qualities which always command respect.<br />\nThe yelling in one or two instances was very<br />\nill-timed. \"There is a time for all things,\"<br />\nand upon these occasions extraordinary care<br />\nshould be taken in the control of such demonstrations. Appropriate yells at seasonable<br />\nmoments not only lend interest to the programme, but impress the audience very favorably with the college spirit and unity of the<br />\n22,<br />\n<br />\nragged yelling at untimely moments, however,<br />\nbecome extremely annoying, and brand the<br />\nstudents as rowdies, having very indistinct<br />\nideas of propriety. One or two outbreaks of<br />\nthis nature were visible on Commemoration<br />\nDay, and in the future pains should be taken<br />\nto eliminate such detrimental proceedings.<br />\nAn assemblage of well-known statesmen and<br />\nscholars filled the stage. Besides our able<br />\nfaculty were a number of distinguished guests,<br />\nincluding Senor Aspirez, the Mexican ambassador; Mr. Torey, of the Mexican embassy;<br />\nCount and Countess Lichtervelde, the minister<br />\nfrom Switzerland, and many others, among<br />\nthem our kind benefactors, Mr. William Wyman and Mr. William S. Keyser.<br />\nFollowing the chant \"Benedictus,\" President Gilman introduced Dr. Hill, who gave a<br />\nhighly entertaining address on \"The Influence<br />\nof Universities upon National Life.\"<br />\nThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy was<br />\nconferred upon Messrs. George Ernest Barnett,<br />\nBenjamin Palmer Caldwell, Arthur Henry<br />\nEwing and Norman Everett Gilbert.<br />\nPresident Gilman announced his resignation<br />\nin a simple, brief address, and proceeded to<br />\nthe announcements. In a few words the expectant audience was informed that the $1,000,000 had not yet made its appearance, and that<br />\nno means for securing it had yet been devised.<br />\nNo little pleasure was expressed by the<br />\nfriends of Dr. Paul Haupt at the honor conferred upon him by Emperor William. At<br />\nthe conclusion of the exercises President and<br />\nMrs. Gilman entertained Dr. Hill and the<br />\nguests from Washington in the Donovan Room.<br />\nDuring the day Dr. Gilman was the recipient of the following telegrams from the various<br />\nHopkins Alumni Associations;<br />\n\"CHICAGO, ILL., Feb. 21, 1901.<br />\nUniversity:<br />\nHofileins<br />\nTo Yohns<br />\nGreeting our Alma Mater this Commemoration Day, we trust that the financial assistance<br />\nlately so fortunately proffered her may be<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\namplified many fold, and we join in thanking<br />\nher generons and appreciated benefactors.<br />\nNoRTHwiisTimN ASSOCIATION,<br />\nOF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nThe following came from the Pacific coast: .<br />\n\"SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, Feb. 22, 1901.<br />\n7b President ql 7ohnsWopleins University:<br />\nThe Hopkins men of the University of<br />\nWashington extend greetings and congratulations.<br />\nTOM KANE,<br />\nH. 0.

The hundred or more<br />\nof us who met at the Rennert the evening of<br />\nCommemoration Day did most heartily celebrate the twenty-fifth birthday of our Alma<br />\nMater, and our reunion.<br />\nWe were very fortunate to have with us that<br />\nevening Mr. Wyman,through whose generosity<br />\nGreater Johns Hopkins becomes a probability,<br />\nand although Messrs Keyser, and Jencks and<br />\nthe other gentlemen who joined them in their<br />\ngift to us were not present, they were not<br />\nforgotten.<br />\nMr. Geo. Dobbin Penniman was toastmaster,<br />\nand seated on either side of him at the head<br />\n<br />\ntable were the speakers of the evening, President Oilman, Messrs John K. Cowen, Wm.<br />\nH. Buckter, and Dr. James C. Mackenzie, of<br />\nTome Institute, and Mr. J. R. Brackett, the<br />\nnewly elected President of the Alumni Association.<br />\nDr. Gilman was given quite an ovation of<br />\ncheers and applause when he entered the room,<br />\nand but for his especial request should like to<br />\ntell you all he said, but I can only hint that he<br />\ntold us how he captured Drs. Gildersleeve,<br />\nSylvester, and Rowland twenty-five years ago.<br />\nDr. Gilman was followed by Mr. Wyman<br />\nwho spoke a few words of thanks for the<br />\nhearty and prolonged applause which greeted<br />\nhim. Then came Mr. Cowen who told us<br />\nwhat a good railroad man a college man made,<br />\nand also said, in reference to the proposed new<br />\nballot, that he recommended its being printed<br />\nin Sanskrit so that only Dr. Haupt and a few<br />\nothers as deeply versed in original and research<br />\nwork might.have the honor of voting intelligently.<br />\nDr. Mackenzie then gave us an interesting<br />\naccount of the Prep. Schools which he called<br />\nthe \"Kitchens of the Universities.\"<br />\nThe last speaker was Mr. Buckter who spoke<br />\non the educated man, what he had done in the<br />\npast, and what was before him for the future.<br />\nIn the intervals between toasts a quartette<br />\nfrom the Glee Club, and four members of .the<br />\nBanjo Club entertained us with music, and we<br />\nall sang some of the old songs we used to sing<br />\nwhen we were freshmen.<br />\nThe banquet closed with Auld Sang Sync,<br />\nwhich was sung standing, and we all left to<br />\nmeet again next year.<br />\nJ.

These contests always bring out interest in student<br />\naffairs by the public of Baltimore, and the<br />\nhall is generally filled to overflowing. This<br />\nyear the debate, and the Freshman contest are<br />\nexpected to be very interesting and exciting,<br />\nas the men of all three classes are working<br />\nhard. The side winning the debate receives<br />\nthe Adams Trophy, which, despite the resignation of Prof. Adams, has again been offered,<br />\nand each member of the winning team is<br />\nrecompensed by books also given by Dr.<br />\nAdams. The Lee Trophy is the reward to<br />\nthe best Freshman Speaker.<br />\nThe Senior team is hard at work with about<br />\ntwelve candidates for the nine positions. The<br />\nmen trying for the speakers' positions are :\u2014<br />\nBird, Boyer, Swindell, Tyler, Whitman, Riggins, Bandel, secretary, and Machen, chairman.<br />\nThe members of the Junior team have also<br />\nbeen pushing along, and are making very<br />\nsatisfactory progress. The first and second<br />\nspeakers will be chosen shortly, and several<br />\nmen have already begun training. Naughty<br />\ntwo is generally supporting the team, whose<br />\nmeetings are weJ1 attended. The places will<br />\nprobably be distributed among the following<br />\nmen :\u2014Markell, secretary, Diggs, Campbell,<br />\nStrouse, Stone, chairman, Neer, Pels, Putts,<br />\nGuggenheimer, Wohnan, Wroth. The question to be debated is Resolved, \"That the<br />\nUnited States should build, own, operate and<br />\ncontrol an inter-oceanic canal, by way of<br />\nNicaragua.\" The Juniors have the affirmative,<br />\nand the Seniors the negative. The question<br />\nis a good one for debate, and a warm contest<br />\nmay be expected.<br />\n'Four Freshmen will speak in the contest for<br />\npublic speaking. Many men started out, but<br />\nat the time of going to press it was stated<br />\nthat the speakers would probably be chosen<br />\nfrom the following :\u2014Addison, Dochez, Blum,<br />\nMeeks, Tootle, Plaggemeyer, Zimmerman.<br />\n<br />\nJunior Class held its annual banquet<br />\nTHE<br />\nat the Mt.

The presence<br />\nof Messrs Sneeringer and White was a sure<br />\nguarantee that there would be little time spent<br />\nin silent meditation, and the evening was one<br />\ngrand opera. All the songs from the most<br />\nrecent to those of \"by gone days'' were sung,<br />\nand it was evident that there were other musical stars besides those on the Glee Club.<br />\nThe menu and toast cards were tastefully<br />\ngotten up, and the committee on arrangements<br />\nMessrs.Beasley,Moore and Koppleman deserve<br />\nto be congratulated. The committee on toasts<br />\nwas composed of Messrs Wroth, Sneeringer<br />\nand Myers. liben C. Hill was toastmaster,<br />\nand called upon the following men for toasts.<br />\nRobert E.

Elsewhere it is usually<br />\ncustomary for a college paper to devote itself<br />\nexclusively to one particular line of work,\u2014<br />\nhumorous, literary, athletic, or to matters of<br />\nlocal interest, as the case may be, while we are<br />\nforced to cover the entire sphere. Hence, it<br />\nis our aim, first, to disseminate University<br />\nnews, and second to publish such articles as<br />\nmay be of interest to the reader. It is the<br />\nintention of the present board of editors to pursue this policy, and to aid us in this endeavor<br />\nwe earnestly solicit the co-operation of every<br />\nHopkins man, and particularly the undergraduates. Items of University interest, and helpful hints and suggestions would benefit us<br />\nmaterially. Above all, the NEWS-LETTER is.<br />\nconducted by the students, for the students.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nour last issue a change has taken<br />\nSINCE<br />\nplace in the editorial staff of the NEws-<br />\n<br />\nLETTER, and a new editor-in-chief, not without reluctance, assumes the arduous duties<br />\nconnected with that office. Before proceeding<br />\nfurther it is eminently befitting to congratulate<br />\nthe retiring editor upon the excellent manner<br />\nin which the paper has been conducted during<br />\nhis incumbency in office. Mr. Norman Boyer<br />\nhas been connected with the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nsince his Freshman year, and has occupied<br />\nsuccessively the positions of assistant athletic<br />\neditor, news editor, associate editor, and editor-in-chief. During the last-named period<br />\nMr. Boyer's aim has been to exemplify in these<br />\ncolumns the province of the college paper,<br />\nnamely, to publish that kind of news which<br />\ndirectly interests the student. In pursuing<br />\nthis aim he has advanced the standard of the<br />\npaper, and, largely owing to his efforts, it now<br />\noccupies a much more vital position among<br />\nHopkins students than it was possible for it to<br />\nhold a few years ago. The endeavor of the<br />\nthe paper is to come in close contact with every<br />\nstudent of the University.<br />\n<br />\nA vacancy now exists on the editorial staff<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER, and an opportunity is<br />\nthereby afforded for a display of literary ability<br />\namong the aspiring members of the Freshman<br />\nClass. A position upon the NEWS-LETTER<br />\ngives a man good, practical experience in literary training, which will prove valuable to<br />\nhim in after years, and we strongly urge those<br />\nwho are desirous of obtaining this position to<br />\nhand in, as soon as possible, specimens of their<br />\nwriting, in the form of accounts of athletic<br />\nevents, or matters of University interest. The<br />\nvacancy will probably be filled before the next<br />\nissue of this paper, so the sooner the competitive articles are turned in the better.<br />\n<br />\nshrewdness will out, and you<br />\nYANKEE<br />\ncan't keep a good man down. It took<br />\nthe editor of a New England paper, with all<br />\nthe inheritance of two centuries of Puritan<br />\nastuteness, to tell us here at Hopkins that on<br />\nthe 22nd of February last we were very<br />\nprobably, all unknowing, listening to the<br />\nwords of our next President.<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nWe wonder if the Board of Trustees knew<br />\nas much about this as does our smart New<br />\nEngland friend.<br />\nThis logical conclusion rests upon the<br />\nstatement made by President Gilman in the<br />\ncourse of the Commemoration Day exercises,<br />\nthat next October a formal celebration of the<br />\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the beginning of<br />\nacademic work is to be held, at which time<br />\nthe retired President is expected to make a<br />\nfew remarks, and the incoming executive will<br />\nmake his inaugural address. This, says the<br />\nMassachusetts editor, does not look as if the<br />\ntrustees were still groping in the dark.<br />\nDr. David Jayne Hill, who delivered the<br />\nCommemoration Day address, would make an<br />\nadmirable president, having already served in<br />\nthat capacity at both Bucknell and Rochester<br />\nUniversities. He is a man of culture and<br />\nlearning, and is known extensively as an<br />\nauthor of works on finance, rhetoric, biography<br />\nand psychology.<br />\n<br />\nthe past week a subscription paper<br />\nDURING<br />\nfor the improvement of our York Road<br />\nAthletic Grounds, has been circulated among<br />\nthe students. The importance of signing this<br />\nsubscription, whether the amount given be<br />\nlarge or small, cannot be underestimated,<br />\nfor when the matter is sifted, it comes down to<br />\nthe question of whether or not we wish to promote Hopkins athletics. Every one realizes<br />\nthe inestimable service Physical Director Mackdermott rendered us by procuring, for a nominal sum, a five-year lease on the new American<br />\nLeague grounds; but while we have secured<br />\nthe grounds, it requires a certain amount of<br />\ncapital to make the necessary improvements,<br />\nand as the alumni are interested in the Homewood site, the money for our present needs<br />\nmust come from the student body. The<br />\n\"Homewood\" athletic field will be a great<br />\nboon to us, when we get it, but in the meantime it is necessary to carry on athletics,<br />\nand while future Hopkins classes may enjoy<br />\n\"Homewood,\" the present ones will use<br />\nAmerican League Park.<br />\n<br />\nPATIENCE.<br />\n<br />\nLAST we have a dramatic club! This<br />\nATannouncement<br />\nshould bring joy into the<br />\ncamp of Hopkins, and arouse the enthusiasm<br />\nof the mighty masses ready to support worthy<br />\nenterprises. The club has not only been organized, but a play has been chosen, the cast<br />\nselected, the chorus drilled, and the ballet<br />\nformed. Everything started smoothly, and it<br />\nis hoped that the impetus given to this undertaking by the student body will urge the organization to complete success this year and a permanent position among Hopkins institutions<br />\nin future decades. J. Alan Haughton, 1903,<br />\nconceived the idea, and he, with the men asked<br />\nto co-operate, pressed matters to a head with<br />\nadmirable expediency, so that now it can be<br />\nannounced that the opera, \"Patience,\" by Gilbert and Sullivan, will be rendered by the<br />\nHopkins \"Puff and Patch Club,\" probably<br />\nduring the last week in April.<br />\nWhy should not Hopkins have a dramatic<br />\nsociety? Some years ago \"The Mask and Wig<br />\nClub,\" of the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\ntoured the country for two seasons with their<br />\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Cleopatra,\" and \"Miss Columbia,\" and were eminently successful. In 1893<br />\nor 1894 the \"Triangle Club,\" of Princeton,<br />\nput forth \"Julius Csar,\" a clever musical<br />\nburlesque; Chicago, in the spring of 1899, gave<br />\n\"The Deceitful Dean,\" and now the students<br />\nof Columbia are producing at the Carnegie<br />\nLyceum, in New York, \"Princess Proud,\"<br />\nwritten and composed entirely by the college<br />\nmen. Hopkins ought to be able tc do every<br />\nbit as much in this line as the larger universities, and should exert every effort to produce<br />\na successful play. The advantages to be derived from a dramatic club have already been<br />\npointed out in these columns.<br />\nAlmost everybody admits that the idea is<br />\ngood if it can be worked out; and to show that<br />\nit is possible the \"Puff and Patch Club\" has<br />\nbeen started here in hopes that the students<br />\nwill evince sufficient interest to earnestly take<br />\nhold of the matter, now in a tangible form.<br />\nThe reasons why \"Patience\" has been selected<br />\nto air our histrionic abilities are obvious.<br />\nWhereas other good operas have been given<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n=\"-<br />\n<br />\nfrequently and recently before Baltimore audiences, \"Patience\" has not been performed here<br />\nsince 1881; the choruses are, with two or three<br />\nexceptions, sung in unison, thereby reducing<br />\nindividual work one-half; none of the characters is particularly prominent above the others.<br />\nBut the primary cause of the choice lies in the<br />\nfact that most of the solos are good, all are<br />\n\"catchy,\" and the book ,witty as it is now, with<br />\na little modernizing can be made screamingly<br />\nfunny.<br />\nAs matters stand at present, the cast of the<br />\nopera will be as follows:<br />\n<br />\nPATIENCE,<br />\nAn original comic msthetic opera, by<br />\nGilbert and Sullivan.<br />\nColonel Calverly,<br />\nW B.

The Club was on the<br />\nprogramme to appear but twice, so that when<br />\nthe last piece was played, there was nothing<br />\nelse to do except to remain and wait for any<br />\nforthcoming refreshments, or to adjourn to the<br />\nstreet and there give the members of the Glee<br />\nClub a chance to air their voices.<br />\nAccordingly all the instruments were gathered together, and the crowd started down<br />\nSaint Paul Street singing \"Bring the Wagon<br />\nHome, John.\" But on the way, some one,<br />\nevidently well acquainted with the situation of<br />\nthe Woman's College Dormitories, suggested<br />\nthat the men serenade the College girls. So<br />\nall turned back and started for the nearest<br />\nHome.<br />\nHere a number of popular songs and \"Hullabaloos\" were given, accompanied with sub-<br />\n<br />\ndued applause from the upper windows. Then<br />\nthings were thrown. Apples seemed to be the<br />\ngreatest drug on the market, for during the<br />\nserenade many of these appeared. The men<br />\nat first were undecided how to take these<br />\ntokens, not knowing whether they were thrown<br />\nfrom love of the singing and the men, or from<br />\na desire to discourage the serenaders. However, being a trifle vain, they decided it was<br />\nmore complimentary than otherwise, for surely<br />\nCollege girls never waste apples when other<br />\nthings would serve just as well as missiles.<br />\nSo the concert continued till all the dormitories<br />\nhad been visited and the night watchman not<br />\nappreciating the music (?) had brought a<br />\npoliceman to his assistance. Then having no<br />\npermit to \"give a performance on the street''<br />\nthe crowd disbanded.<br />\nw 941r<br />\n<br />\nMR.

Besides holding high<br />\nrank as a critic and a master of English prose,<br />\nhe is an important figure in the history of philosophic thought during the past half century.<br />\nA follower of Auguste Comte, whom he<br />\nexpressly recognizes as his master, he many<br />\nyears ago came into prominence as the prophet<br />\nof Positivism in England. While making<br />\nlittle if any addition to the doctrine itself, he<br />\ngave to its propaganda as a cult the powerful<br />\naid of his literary ability. The \"Religion of<br />\nHumanity'' had in him its ablest advocate.<br />\nHis position with regard to Positivism was<br />\nclosely akin to that held by Mr. Huxley toward the doctrine of evolution. They were<br />\nthe defenders and expounders of their respective causes. To them the popular ear was<br />\nopen. In the ferment attending the birth of<br />\nthe theory of evolution, there was necessarily<br />\nmuch re-examination of philosophy, and it was<br />\nat this time that Mr. Harrison came to be<br />\nregarded as the especial champion of the Positivist cause in England. In recent years his<br />\nwork has been along more purely literary lines,<br />\nalthough it is not improbable his philosophy<br />\nhas had much to do with giving his work in<br />\npart a historical direction. To this we owe<br />\nhis excellent study of \"Oliver Cromwell''<br />\nand his suggestive book on the \"Meaning of<br />\nHistory.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n:777-<br />\n<br />\nINQUIRY COLUMN.<br />\n(In this column the liftws LETTER will answer, to the best of<br />\nits ability, the queries forwarded by correspondents.)<br />\n<br />\nWhat is a dime of 1873 worth at present?<br />\n' \u2014Collector.<br />\n<br />\nThe coin referred to is worth two sections of<br />\npie in the lunch-room ; or half a hair cut at<br />\nWalter's.

The event was won by the famous<br />\nW. J. Holland, of Georgetown, in 5.01.<br />\nTootle surprised himself and every one else<br />\nby finishing first in the 220 dash. In the first<br />\nheat, Tootle, with a handicap of 20 yards, was<br />\nfirst with Atkinson, who also had 20 yards, a<br />\ndangerous second. The final heat was only a<br />\nrepetition of the first. Time, 24 seconds.<br />\nWhitman, England, Hoffman, and Riggs<br />\nwere the men scheduled for the relay team, and<br />\nran in the order named. It was rumored that<br />\nthe Y. M. C.

No relay<br />\nrace is decided until the finish is reached, but<br />\nit was soon seen that, barring accidents, the<br />\nHopkins fellows would win with a safe<br />\nmargin.

J. Gilden, 28 yards, won<br />\nthe race, with J. H. O'Brien, 28 yards, second.<br />\nBoth were Georgetown men. Time, 56<br />\nminutes flat.<br />\nIn the high jump I. K.

Third honors were divided<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nbetweenl George B. Scholl, of J. H. U. (5<br />\ninches),and Rob ert Garret (5 inches).<br />\nThe shot put earned for our weight men an<br />\nenviable reputation. The event was won by<br />\nG. B.

It not only marked the<br />\ntwenty-fifth birth-day of the University, but<br />\nwitnessed, with regrets, the resignation of the<br />\nfirst and only president of the institution.<br />\nThe attention of the public, which has been<br />\nrecently turned upon Johns Hopkins on account of our newly acquired possessions, also<br />\ncontributed to gather the illustrious assemblage which makes the day a memorable one.<br />\nThe one thing, however, which remained to<br />\ndistinguish the day in the annals of the University, and to mark the beginning of a new<br />\nepoch of unprecedented success, was wanting.<br />\nStudents, faculty, and friends alike waited with<br />\nhopeful expectation to hear the announcements<br />\nfrom \"Uncle Dan,\" but the all important one,<br />\nthe one which all had 'anxiously awaited,<br />\nbrought only disappointment. Let us all,<br />\nlike Uncle Dan, \"have faith in the people,<br />\nfaith in human nature.\"<br />\nAnother subject for surmise among the<br />\naudience was the probable successor of President Gilman. One or two newspapers have<br />\ninsinuated that Dr. David J. Hill, the orator<br />\nof the day, may be the man, but thus far,<br />\nnothing definite has been learned. The ovation given Dr. Hill at the conclusion of his<br />\nspeech, by friends and students alike, plainly<br />\nattests the favorable impression which he<br />\nmade. His address was both eloquent and<br />\nscholarly, and his personality plainly indicates<br />\nthose qualities which always command respect.<br />\nThe yelling in one or two instances was very<br />\nill-timed. \"There is a time for all things,\"<br />\nand upon these occasions extraordinary care<br />\nshould be taken in the control of such demonstrations. Appropriate yells at seasonable<br />\nmoments not only lend interest to the programme, but impress the audience very favorably with the college spirit and unity of the<br />\n22,<br /><br />\nragged yelling at untimely moments, however,<br />\nbecome extremely annoying, and brand the<br />\nstudents as rowdies, having very indistinct<br />\nideas of propriety. One or two outbreaks of<br />\nthis nature were visible on Commemoration<br />\nDay, and in the future pains should be taken<br />\nto eliminate such detrimental proceedings.<br />\nAn assemblage of well-known statesmen and<br />\nscholars filled the stage. Besides our able<br />\nfaculty were a number of distinguished guests,<br />\nincluding Senor Aspirez, the Mexican ambassador; Mr. Torey, of the Mexican embassy;<br />\nCount and Countess Lichtervelde, the minister<br />\nfrom Switzerland, and many others, among<br />\nthem our kind benefactors, Mr. William Wyman and Mr. William S. Keyser.<br />\nFollowing the chant \"Benedictus,\" President Gilman introduced Dr. Hill, who gave a<br />\nhighly entertaining address on \"The Influence<br />\nof Universities upon National Life.\"<br />\nThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy was<br />\nconferred upon Messrs. George Ernest Barnett,<br />\nBenjamin Palmer Caldwell, Arthur Henry<br />\nEwing and Norman Everett Gilbert.<br />\nPresident Gilman announced his resignation<br />\nin a simple, brief address, and proceeded to<br />\nthe announcements. In a few words the expectant audience was informed that the $1,000,000 had not yet made its appearance, and that<br />\nno means for securing it had yet been devised.<br />\nNo little pleasure was expressed by the<br />\nfriends of Dr. Paul Haupt at the honor conferred upon him by Emperor William. At<br />\nthe conclusion of the exercises President and<br />\nMrs. Gilman entertained Dr. Hill and the<br />\nguests from Washington in the Donovan Room.<br />\nDuring the day Dr. Gilman was the recipient of the following telegrams from the various<br />\nHopkins Alumni Associations;<br />\n\"CHICAGO, ILL., Feb. 21, 1901.<br />\nUniversity:<br />\nHofileins<br />\nTo Yohns<br />\nGreeting our Alma Mater this Commemoration Day, we trust that the financial assistance<br />\nlately so fortunately proffered her may be<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n-<br /><br />\namplified many fold, and we join in thanking<br />\nher generons and appreciated benefactors.<br />\nNoRTHwiisTimN ASSOCIATION,<br />\nOF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nThe following came from the Pacific coast: .<br />\n\"SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, Feb. 22, 1901.<br />\n7b President ql 7ohnsWopleins University:<br />\nThe Hopkins men of the University of<br />\nWashington extend greetings and congratulations.<br />\nTOM KANE,<br />\nH. 0.

The hundred or more<br />\nof us who met at the Rennert the evening of<br />\nCommemoration Day did most heartily celebrate the twenty-fifth birthday of our Alma<br />\nMater, and our reunion.<br />\nWe were very fortunate to have with us that<br />\nevening Mr. Wyman,through whose generosity<br />\nGreater Johns Hopkins becomes a probability,<br />\nand although Messrs Keyser, and Jencks and<br />\nthe other gentlemen who joined them in their<br />\ngift to us were not present, they were not<br />\nforgotten.<br />\nMr. Geo. Dobbin Penniman was toastmaster,<br />\nand seated on either side of him at the head<br /><br />\ntable were the speakers of the evening, President Oilman, Messrs John K. Cowen, Wm.<br />\nH. Buckter, and Dr. James C. Mackenzie, of<br />\nTome Institute, and Mr. J. R. Brackett, the<br />\nnewly elected President of the Alumni Association.<br />\nDr. Gilman was given quite an ovation of<br />\ncheers and applause when he entered the room,<br />\nand but for his especial request should like to<br />\ntell you all he said, but I can only hint that he<br />\ntold us how he captured Drs. Gildersleeve,<br />\nSylvester, and Rowland twenty-five years ago.<br />\nDr. Gilman was followed by Mr. Wyman<br />\nwho spoke a few words of thanks for the<br />\nhearty and prolonged applause which greeted<br />\nhim. Then came Mr. Cowen who told us<br />\nwhat a good railroad man a college man made,<br />\nand also said, in reference to the proposed new<br />\nballot, that he recommended its being printed<br />\nin Sanskrit so that only Dr. Haupt and a few<br />\nothers as deeply versed in original and research<br />\nwork might.have the honor of voting intelligently.<br />\nDr. Mackenzie then gave us an interesting<br />\naccount of the Prep. Schools which he called<br />\nthe \"Kitchens of the Universities.\"<br />\nThe last speaker was Mr. Buckter who spoke<br />\non the educated man, what he had done in the<br />\npast, and what was before him for the future.<br />\nIn the intervals between toasts a quartette<br />\nfrom the Glee Club, and four members of .the<br />\nBanjo Club entertained us with music, and we<br />\nall sang some of the old songs we used to sing<br />\nwhen we were freshmen.<br />\nThe banquet closed with Auld Sang Sync,<br />\nwhich was sung standing, and we all left to<br />\nmeet again next year.<br />\nJ.

These contests always bring out interest in student<br />\naffairs by the public of Baltimore, and the<br />\nhall is generally filled to overflowing. This<br />\nyear the debate, and the Freshman contest are<br />\nexpected to be very interesting and exciting,<br />\nas the men of all three classes are working<br />\nhard. The side winning the debate receives<br />\nthe Adams Trophy, which, despite the resignation of Prof. Adams, has again been offered,<br />\nand each member of the winning team is<br />\nrecompensed by books also given by Dr.<br />\nAdams. The Lee Trophy is the reward to<br />\nthe best Freshman Speaker.<br />\nThe Senior team is hard at work with about<br />\ntwelve candidates for the nine positions. The<br />\nmen trying for the speakers' positions are :\u2014<br />\nBird, Boyer, Swindell, Tyler, Whitman, Riggins, Bandel, secretary, and Machen, chairman.<br />\nThe members of the Junior team have also<br />\nbeen pushing along, and are making very<br />\nsatisfactory progress. The first and second<br />\nspeakers will be chosen shortly, and several<br />\nmen have already begun training. Naughty<br />\ntwo is generally supporting the team, whose<br />\nmeetings are weJ1 attended. The places will<br />\nprobably be distributed among the following<br />\nmen :\u2014Markell, secretary, Diggs, Campbell,<br />\nStrouse, Stone, chairman, Neer, Pels, Putts,<br />\nGuggenheimer, Wohnan, Wroth. The question to be debated is Resolved, \"That the<br />\nUnited States should build, own, operate and<br />\ncontrol an inter-oceanic canal, by way of<br />\nNicaragua.\" The Juniors have the affirmative,<br />\nand the Seniors the negative. The question<br />\nis a good one for debate, and a warm contest<br />\nmay be expected.<br />\n'Four Freshmen will speak in the contest for<br />\npublic speaking. Many men started out, but<br />\nat the time of going to press it was stated<br />\nthat the speakers would probably be chosen<br />\nfrom the following :\u2014Addison, Dochez, Blum,<br />\nMeeks, Tootle, Plaggemeyer, Zimmerman.<br /><br />\nJunior Class held its annual banquet<br />\nTHE<br />\nat the Mt.

The presence<br />\nof Messrs Sneeringer and White was a sure<br />\nguarantee that there would be little time spent<br />\nin silent meditation, and the evening was one<br />\ngrand opera. All the songs from the most<br />\nrecent to those of \"by gone days'' were sung,<br />\nand it was evident that there were other musical stars besides those on the Glee Club.<br />\nThe menu and toast cards were tastefully<br />\ngotten up, and the committee on arrangements<br />\nMessrs.Beasley,Moore and Koppleman deserve<br />\nto be congratulated. The committee on toasts<br />\nwas composed of Messrs Wroth, Sneeringer<br />\nand Myers. liben C. Hill was toastmaster,<br />\nand called upon the following men for toasts.<br />\nRobert E. Moore, \"Old Toni Hopkins'';<br />\nHorace Gillespie, \"Our Missing Ribs'' Lyman<br />\nC. Murphy, \"Our Newly Acquired Possessions\" ; Robert T. Crane, \"Our Royal Selves\";<br />\nW.J.

Elsewhere it is usually<br />\ncustomary for a college paper to devote itself<br />\nexclusively to one particular line of work,\u2014<br />\nhumorous, literary, athletic, or to matters of<br />\nlocal interest, as the case may be, while we are<br />\nforced to cover the entire sphere. Hence, it<br />\nis our aim, first, to disseminate University<br />\nnews, and second to publish such articles as<br />\nmay be of interest to the reader. It is the<br />\nintention of the present board of editors to pursue this policy, and to aid us in this endeavor<br />\nwe earnestly solicit the co-operation of every<br />\nHopkins man, and particularly the undergraduates. Items of University interest, and helpful hints and suggestions would benefit us<br />\nmaterially. Above all, the NEWS-LETTER is.<br />\nconducted by the students, for the students.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br /><br />\nour last issue a change has taken<br />\nSINCE<br />\nplace in the editorial staff of the NEws-<br /><br />\nLETTER, and a new editor-in-chief, not without reluctance, assumes the arduous duties<br />\nconnected with that office. Before proceeding<br />\nfurther it is eminently befitting to congratulate<br />\nthe retiring editor upon the excellent manner<br />\nin which the paper has been conducted during<br />\nhis incumbency in office. Mr. Norman Boyer<br />\nhas been connected with the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nsince his Freshman year, and has occupied<br />\nsuccessively the positions of assistant athletic<br />\neditor, news editor, associate editor, and editor-in-chief. During the last-named period<br />\nMr. Boyer's aim has been to exemplify in these<br />\ncolumns the province of the college paper,<br />\nnamely, to publish that kind of news which<br />\ndirectly interests the student. In pursuing<br />\nthis aim he has advanced the standard of the<br />\npaper, and, largely owing to his efforts, it now<br />\noccupies a much more vital position among<br />\nHopkins students than it was possible for it to<br />\nhold a few years ago. The endeavor of the<br />\nthe paper is to come in close contact with every<br />\nstudent of the University.<br /><br />\nA vacancy now exists on the editorial staff<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER, and an opportunity is<br />\nthereby afforded for a display of literary ability<br />\namong the aspiring members of the Freshman<br />\nClass. A position upon the NEWS-LETTER<br />\ngives a man good, practical experience in literary training, which will prove valuable to<br />\nhim in after years, and we strongly urge those<br />\nwho are desirous of obtaining this position to<br />\nhand in, as soon as possible, specimens of their<br />\nwriting, in the form of accounts of athletic<br />\nevents, or matters of University interest. The<br />\nvacancy will probably be filled before the next<br />\nissue of this paper, so the sooner the competitive articles are turned in the better.<br /><br />\nshrewdness will out, and you<br />\nYANKEE<br />\ncan't keep a good man down. It took<br />\nthe editor of a New England paper, with all<br />\nthe inheritance of two centuries of Puritan<br />\nastuteness, to tell us here at Hopkins that on<br />\nthe 22nd of February last we were very<br />\nprobably, all unknowing, listening to the<br />\nwords of our next President.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nWe wonder if the Board of Trustees knew<br />\nas much about this as does our smart New<br />\nEngland friend.<br />\nThis logical conclusion rests upon the<br />\nstatement made by President Gilman in the<br />\ncourse of the Commemoration Day exercises,<br />\nthat next October a formal celebration of the<br />\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the beginning of<br />\nacademic work is to be held, at which time<br />\nthe retired President is expected to make a<br />\nfew remarks, and the incoming executive will<br />\nmake his inaugural address. This, says the<br />\nMassachusetts editor, does not look as if the<br />\ntrustees were still groping in the dark.<br />\nDr. David Jayne Hill, who delivered the<br />\nCommemoration Day address, would make an<br />\nadmirable president, having already served in<br />\nthat capacity at both Bucknell and Rochester<br />\nUniversities. He is a man of culture and<br />\nlearning, and is known extensively as an<br />\nauthor of works on finance, rhetoric, biography<br />\nand psychology.<br /><br />\nthe past week a subscription paper<br />\nDURING<br />\nfor the improvement of our York Road<br />\nAthletic Grounds, has been circulated among<br />\nthe students. The importance of signing this<br />\nsubscription, whether the amount given be<br />\nlarge or small, cannot be underestimated,<br />\nfor when the matter is sifted, it comes down to<br />\nthe question of whether or not we wish to promote Hopkins athletics. Every one realizes<br />\nthe inestimable service Physical Director Mackdermott rendered us by procuring, for a nominal sum, a five-year lease on the new American<br />\nLeague grounds; but while we have secured<br />\nthe grounds, it requires a certain amount of<br />\ncapital to make the necessary improvements,<br />\nand as the alumni are interested in the Homewood site, the money for our present needs<br />\nmust come from the student body. The<br />\n\"Homewood\" athletic field will be a great<br />\nboon to us, when we get it, but in the meantime it is necessary to carry on athletics,<br />\nand while future Hopkins classes may enjoy<br />\n\"Homewood,\" the present ones will use<br />\nAmerican League Park.<br /><br />\nPATIENCE.<br /><br />\nLAST we have a dramatic club! This<br />\nATannouncement<br />\nshould bring joy into the<br />\ncamp of Hopkins, and arouse the enthusiasm<br />\nof the mighty masses ready to support worthy<br />\nenterprises. The club has not only been organized, but a play has been chosen, the cast<br />\nselected, the chorus drilled, and the ballet<br />\nformed. Everything started smoothly, and it<br />\nis hoped that the impetus given to this undertaking by the student body will urge the organization to complete success this year and a permanent position among Hopkins institutions<br />\nin future decades. J. Alan Haughton, 1903,<br />\nconceived the idea, and he, with the men asked<br />\nto co-operate, pressed matters to a head with<br />\nadmirable expediency, so that now it can be<br />\nannounced that the opera, \"Patience,\" by Gilbert and Sullivan, will be rendered by the<br />\nHopkins \"Puff and Patch Club,\" probably<br />\nduring the last week in April.<br />\nWhy should not Hopkins have a dramatic<br />\nsociety? Some years ago \"The Mask and Wig<br />\nClub,\" of the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\ntoured the country for two seasons with their<br />\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Cleopatra,\" and \"Miss Columbia,\" and were eminently successful. In 1893<br />\nor 1894 the \"Triangle Club,\" of Princeton,<br />\nput forth \"Julius Csar,\" a clever musical<br />\nburlesque; Chicago, in the spring of 1899, gave<br />\n\"The Deceitful Dean,\" and now the students<br />\nof Columbia are producing at the Carnegie<br />\nLyceum, in New York, \"Princess Proud,\"<br />\nwritten and composed entirely by the college<br />\nmen. Hopkins ought to be able tc do every<br />\nbit as much in this line as the larger universities, and should exert every effort to produce<br />\na successful play. The advantages to be derived from a dramatic club have already been<br />\npointed out in these columns.<br />\nAlmost everybody admits that the idea is<br />\ngood if it can be worked out; and to show that<br />\nit is possible the \"Puff and Patch Club\" has<br />\nbeen started here in hopes that the students<br />\nwill evince sufficient interest to earnestly take<br />\nhold of the matter, now in a tangible form.<br />\nThe reasons why \"Patience\" has been selected<br />\nto air our histrionic abilities are obvious.<br />\nWhereas other good operas have been given<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n=\"-<br /><br />\nfrequently and recently before Baltimore audiences, \"Patience\" has not been performed here<br />\nsince 1881; the choruses are, with two or three<br />\nexceptions, sung in unison, thereby reducing<br />\nindividual work one-half; none of the characters is particularly prominent above the others.<br />\nBut the primary cause of the choice lies in the<br />\nfact that most of the solos are good, all are<br />\n\"catchy,\" and the book ,witty as it is now, with<br />\na little modernizing can be made screamingly<br />\nfunny.<br />\nAs matters stand at present, the cast of the<br />\nopera will be as follows:<br /><br />\nPATIENCE,<br />\nAn original comic msthetic opera, by<br />\nGilbert and Sullivan.<br />\nColonel Calverly,<br />\nW B.

The Club was on the<br />\nprogramme to appear but twice, so that when<br />\nthe last piece was played, there was nothing<br />\nelse to do except to remain and wait for any<br />\nforthcoming refreshments, or to adjourn to the<br />\nstreet and there give the members of the Glee<br />\nClub a chance to air their voices.<br />\nAccordingly all the instruments were gathered together, and the crowd started down<br />\nSaint Paul Street singing \"Bring the Wagon<br />\nHome, John.\" But on the way, some one,<br />\nevidently well acquainted with the situation of<br />\nthe Woman's College Dormitories, suggested<br />\nthat the men serenade the College girls. So<br />\nall turned back and started for the nearest<br />\nHome.<br />\nHere a number of popular songs and \"Hullabaloos\" were given, accompanied with sub-<br /><br />\ndued applause from the upper windows. Then<br />\nthings were thrown. Apples seemed to be the<br />\ngreatest drug on the market, for during the<br />\nserenade many of these appeared. The men<br />\nat first were undecided how to take these<br />\ntokens, not knowing whether they were thrown<br />\nfrom love of the singing and the men, or from<br />\na desire to discourage the serenaders. However, being a trifle vain, they decided it was<br />\nmore complimentary than otherwise, for surely<br />\nCollege girls never waste apples when other<br />\nthings would serve just as well as missiles.<br />\nSo the concert continued till all the dormitories<br />\nhad been visited and the night watchman not<br />\nappreciating the music (?) had brought a<br />\npoliceman to his assistance.

Besides holding high<br />\nrank as a critic and a master of English prose,<br />\nhe is an important figure in the history of philosophic thought during the past half century.<br />\nA follower of Auguste Comte, whom he<br />\nexpressly recognizes as his master, he many<br />\nyears ago came into prominence as the prophet<br />\nof Positivism in England. While making<br />\nlittle if any addition to the doctrine itself, he<br />\ngave to its propaganda as a cult the powerful<br />\naid of his literary ability. The \"Religion of<br />\nHumanity'' had in him its ablest advocate.<br />\nHis position with regard to Positivism was<br />\nclosely akin to that held by Mr. Huxley toward the doctrine of evolution.

M. C. A.<br />\nWatson, Tootle, Whitman, and Atkinson<br />\nqualified for the semi-finals in the 50 yard<br />\ndash, but none of them were able to get into<br />\nthe finals. The event was won by the famous<br />\nW. J. Holland, of Georgetown, in 5.01.<br />\nTootle surprised himself and every one else<br />\nby finishing first in the 220 dash. In the first<br />\nheat, Tootle, with a handicap of 20 yards, was<br />\nfirst with Atkinson, who also had 20 yards, a<br />\ndangerous second. The final heat was only a<br />\nrepetition of the first. Time, 24 seconds.<br />\nWhitman, England, Hoffman, and Riggs<br />\nwere the men scheduled for the relay team, and<br />\nran in the order named. It was rumored that<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A. men were offering 2 to i on<br />\ntheir team, but unfortunately for some of the<br />\nsanguine and enthusiastic Hopkins\"rooters\"<br />\nthe report could not be verified. No relay<br />\nrace is decided until the finish is reached, but<br />\nit was soon seen that, barring accidents, the<br />\nHopkins fellows would win with a safe<br />\nmargin. Riggs crossed the line a winner with<br />\nplenty of daylight between himself and the<br />\nY. M. C. A. contestant.<br />\nThatcher, with 38 yards, and Riggs, with<br />\n30 yards, were the only J. H. U. men who<br />\ntoed the mark for the 440 yard race.<br />\nThatcher ran well up for a while, but the pace<br />\nwas too hot, and he was compelled to fall back.<br />\nBy a magnificent spurt that brought him from<br />\na place far in the rear, Riggs managed to<br />\ncapture third place. J. Gilden, 28 yards, won<br />\nthe race, with J. H. O'Brien, 28 yards, second.<br />\nBoth were Georgetown men. Time, 56<br />\nminutes flat.<br />\nIn the high jump I. K. Baxter, unattached<br />\n(scratch), won the event by jumping 6 feet,<br />\n2 inches. Second was S. S. Jones, of New<br />\nYork University. Third honors were divided<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nbetweenl George B. Scholl, of J. H. U. (5<br />\ninches),and Rob ert Garret (5 inches).<br />\nThe shot put earned for our weight men an<br />\nenviable reputation. The event was won by<br />\nG. B. Scholl, 8 feet, whose actual put was 33<br />\nfeet, 8 inches; second, Harvey B. Stone, 8<br />\n'feet, actual put 33 feet, 554 inches; third,<br />\nH. S. Whitman, 7 feet, actual put 33 feet,<br />\ninch.<br />\nThese were the only events in which Hopkins was entered. Among other features on<br />\nthe program which attracted general interest<br />\nwere the 50 yard special dash, the mile run,<br />\nthe 2 mile run, the special relay races, and<br />\nWefer's exhibition 220.<br />\nThe special dash brought together some of<br />\nthe best men in the country. As was expected,<br />\nDuffy carried off the honors. He ran the fifty<br />\nyards in five seconds flat. This lowers the<br />\nrecord for Convention Hall.<br />\nWith 25 yards handicap, Stuart, of University of Pennsylvania, was able to beat Dick<br />\nGrant, (scratch) of Harvard, in the mile run.<br />\nBernard Wefers ran an exhibition 220 yards in<br />\npace. Time 22.4 seconds.<br />\nThe 2 mile run was a nip-and-tuck<br />\nfight between the Grant brothers. The last<br />\nquarter was run at quarter-dash speed.
