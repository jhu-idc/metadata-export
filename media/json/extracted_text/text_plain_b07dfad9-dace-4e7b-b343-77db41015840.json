Speculations, estimates,<br />\nand guesses as to the team's standing and chances are commonplace.<br />\nAll candidates reporting have been<br />\nput through rigorous daily workouts,<br />\nunder the direction of Head Coach<br />\nAssistant<br />\nGardner Mallonee and<br />\nCoach Utz Twardowicz. All were put<br />\non an equal basis, freshmen and vets,<br />\nlast year's lettermen, and this year's<br />\ngreen candidates.<br />\nCaptain Herb Seigel leads the lineup<br />\nof veteran lettermen returning from<br />\nlast year. Wearing his varsity letter<br />\nnow for three years, Siegel returns for his last season as forward<br />\nwith the Blue courtsters. Practices<br />\nhave shown him to be up to his usual<br />\ndependable self. Fast and accurate,<br />\nSeigel was a state high scorer last<br />\nyear. Hoping to lead his cagemen<br />\nthrough a successful season, he remains the mainstay of the Blue Jay<br />\noffense.<br />\nCompleting the forward duet is<br />\nNorm Melvin, also a letter vet, shifted<br />\nto this position from his last year's<br />\npivot post. The lanky sharpshooter<br />\nwas a high scorer last year.

A scrappy fighter,<br />\nTraggis seems in line to see plenty of<br />\naction this year.<br />\nGuard Carl Rasin, first string man<br />\nof the last two seasons, and also wearer of his varsity letter, returns this<br />\nyear as a junior. So far, Rosin's last<br />\nyear's nemesis, a trick ankle, hasn't<br />\ncropped up. Riper through his two<br />\nyears' experience, Rasin is the prime<br />\ndefense man, and a deadly distance<br />\nshot.<br />\nAmbidextrous Zheutlin<br />\nCompetition is keen for the twin<br />\nguard berth. \"Ace\" Zheutlin, tall and<br />\nrangy, is likeliest contender. He is<br />\nthe only man in the group who is a<br />\ngood shot with either hand.<br />\nLes Rosenthal and Len Rubinger<br />\nare also battling it out for the guard<br />\npost. Both likely candidates, they<br />\nshould see acton as capable reserves.<br />\nShorty Cross, last year's pivot man,<br />\nappears much improved this year as<br />\nhe carries his towering height up and<br />\ndown the length of the court.<br />\nJerry Carlton, Alleghany-produced,<br />\ngiant freshman is Cross's competition.<br />\nIn spite of his lack of experience,<br />\nCarlton has made a nice showing in<br />\npractice scrimmage. Other freshmen<br />\nwho have made an impressive showing<br />\nin practice are Brayshaw and Almquist, with several others.<br />\nTall Team<br />\nIt is a tall team that the Hopkins is<br />\nturning out this year. Candidates and<br />\nvets all range near six feet or over,<br />\nwith the exception of Traggis. As has<br />\nbeen the custom in practice, a cutting<br />\nand passing offense will be used. That<br />\nis, there is no set system of plays, but<br />\na concentrated attack on the basket.<br />\nAs for oefense, a man to man, rather<br />\nthan zone, or combination defense<br />\nwill be employed.<br />\n\"Little Stronger\"<br />\nIn the Maryland Intercollegiate<br />\nLeague, the Blue team's chances, according to Coach Mallonee should be<br />\na \"little stronger.\" The League pits<br />\nsix teams against each other in a<br />\ndouble round: those of Washington,<br />\nwho won last year; Mount St. Mary's;<br />\nLoyola;<br />\nWestern<br />\nMaryland;<br />\nSt.<br />\nJohn's; and the Hopkins. Competition<br />\nremains about the same this year. One<br />\nor two of the teams, however, have<br />\nweakened slightly, giving the Hopkins<br />\nquintet a chance to rise from the<br />\nrather low position it finished in last<br />\nyear.<br />\nCompetition in the League is always very keen. There has never been<br />\nsuch an outstanding winner that it<br />\nhas been obvious from the start that<br />\nthat team would win, It is often not<br />\nevident until the last week of play<br />\nwhich team will emerge victorious.<br /><br />\nCoach Hambleton Pleased<br />\nWith Varsity Material;<br />\nSophs Display Form<br />\nCaptain D.
