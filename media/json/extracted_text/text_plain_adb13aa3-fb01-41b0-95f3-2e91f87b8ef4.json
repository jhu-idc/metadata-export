For some reason there is a consistent dearth<br />\nof crackerjack material, most of the men being light<br />\nin weight and not coming out in sufficient numbers to<br />\nform an adequate reserve strength. With the situation such it is no wonder that we cannot schedule<br />\nany better than second or third rate teams without<br />\nbeing annihilated and with the University's present<br />\nlack of funds there is no prospect of our being able<br />\nto induce better athletes by means of athletic scholarships.<br />\nThese factors would seem to spell all sorts of<br />\ndoom for any team, yet the, surprising fact remains<br />\nthat the football season pays for the deficits of the<br />\nbasketball, track, and lacrosse squads. Even though<br />\nthe Hopkins lacrosse squad is the recognized world<br />\nchampion of the sport there are more outsiders willing<br />\nto pay to see the Hampden-Sydney gridders bow to<br />\nus in defeat by a small margin than to see us trample<br />\nthe crack U. of M. stickmen.<br />\nEven this redeeming feature does not relieve the<br />\nstudent body from the blame due it for its steady<br />\nlack of team support year after year.

No expert<br />\ndiagnostician is required in order to arrive at that<br />\nconclusion\u2014it's self-evident from the material available and the schools to be met.

For some reason there is a consistent dearth<br />\nof crackerjack material, most of the men being light<br />\nin weight and not coming out in sufficient numbers to<br />\nform an adequate reserve strength. With the situation such it is no wonder that we cannot schedule<br />\nany better than second or third rate teams without<br />\nbeing annihilated and with the University's present<br />\nlack of funds there is no prospect of our being able<br />\nto induce better athletes by means of athletic scholarships.<br />\nThese factors would seem to spell all sorts of<br />\ndoom for any team, yet the, surprising fact remains<br />\nthat the football season pays for the deficits of the<br />\nbasketball, track, and lacrosse squads. Even though<br />\nthe Hopkins lacrosse squad is the recognized world<br />\nchampion of the sport there are more outsiders willing<br />\nto pay to see the Hampden-Sydney gridders bow to<br />\nus in defeat by a small margin than to see us trample<br />\nthe crack U. of M. stickmen.<br />\nEven this redeeming feature does not relieve the<br />\nstudent body from the blame due it for its steady<br />\nlack of team support year after year.
