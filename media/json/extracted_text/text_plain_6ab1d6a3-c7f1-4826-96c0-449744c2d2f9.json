The<br />\nSchool's problems, said Lombardi, are aggravated by by the size of the faculty, which<br />\nis large relative to the School's income.<br />\nA further problem stems from the ongoing<br />\ncampus renovations; when planned, in 1985,<br />\nit was intended that the costs incurred by these<br />\nrenovations would be allocated to the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences.

Despite stepped-up security efforts, including more stringent i.d. checking<br />\n'and increasing the number of watchful eyes in<br />\nthe locker rooms, reports of larceny are still<br />\nnumerous. And yet, students continue to leave<br />\nbelongings around which just cry out to be<br />\nstolen.<br />\nSo in the Athletic Center, and everywhere<br />\non campus,please be aware and be careful not<br />\nto give those easy opportunities at theft.<br />\n<br />\nHonoring Arellano<br />\nThe dedication of the Roberto R. Arellano<br />\nTheater today at 5 p.m. shows a great deal of<br />\nrespect to a part of Hopkins that we lost late<br />\nlast November. That the University acted so<br />\nquickly in renaming the L/V Room is<br />\ncommendable.<br />\nThe late professor Arellano infused the<br />\nWriting Seminars department with a vitality<br />\npreviously unknown to it. He ambitiously and<br />\nenergetically drew students into the writing program and was rewarded with the popularity and<br />\nsuccess of the department.<br />\nIt is ironic that the L/V Room should become<br />\n<br />\nthe Arellano Theater because his efforts toward<br />\nimproving the L/V Room's theatrical<br />\ncapabilities went largely unrewarded. Arellano<br />\ntried for years to secure for the Room a decent<br />\nsound system, sound insulation (to facilitate<br />\ncoordinating events in the Glass Pavilion and<br />\nin Levering) and even spotlights.<br />\nThe naming of the Arellano Theater pays<br />\ntribute to the man and his devotion and his<br />\nachievements. An even greater tribute to his<br />\nlegacy would be to carry out those renovations<br />\nfor which he fought; certainly Arellano would<br />\nhave preferred new facilities to a new name.<br />\n<br />\nNews,Letter<br />\nEditors<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nFlory Ware, Lisa Weisbord<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nLayout Editors<br />\nEly Brown, Jonathan Engler<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

Being a foolhardy<br />\nfreshman, I volunteered to take<br />\nhis place and write a weekly<br />\neditorial.<br />\nSo here I sit at my word processor, watching the snow fall<br />\noutside, wrestling with writer's<br />\nblock at this early stage of my<br />\ncareer. I ask my roommate how<br />\nhe would start a new column, but<br />\nhe doesn't hear me because he is<br />\nlistening to some music in<br />\nChinese. It looks like I'm on my<br />\nown. So I think about the green<br />\nthing I ate for dinner. Then my<br />\nmind wanders back to this<br />\ncolumn.<br />\nNow I would like to present to<br />\nyou my first column, THE BEST<br />\nWAY NOT TO START A NEW<br />\nJOHNS<br />\nCOLUMN<br />\nAT<br />\nHOPKINS. Of course, everyone<br />\nknows that there are several ways<br />\nnot to begin a new column, the<br />\nmost prominent of which being<br />\nharping on the administration,<br />\nSeiler's, Baltimore, Barnes and<br />\nNoble, or the Coalition, because<br />\nno one wants to hear about them<br />\nanymore. At least not before the<br />\ntuition raises are announced.<br />\nI could write a creative and<br />\nhumorous exposition on how I<br />\nhate it when those little pieces of<br />\ngravel that they put on the ice gets<br />\nstuck in Ty tennis shoes, or that<br />\n<br />\nneat trick I learned with salt and<br />\nglasses. I picked up some great<br />\nanecdotes watching PBS recently that my once and future readers<br />\nmay find interesting, amusing,<br />\nand even provocative, that I could<br />\nprint here. I should complain, that<br />\nin the past two days I've been<br />\nasked three times whether I'm a<br />\nmed student when people I've<br />\nmet learned I'm from Hopkins.<br />\nBut I think THE BEST WAY<br />\nNOT TO START A NEW COLUMN AT JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nwould be by not ragging on<br />\n<br />\nLittle More Leeway<br />\nLEE, from 10<br />\ncouldn't count that either, as Asa<br />\ntook the opportunity to deliver not<br />\nan unclenched hand but a bloodletting blow to my nose.

It<br />\nspans half a century, tracing<br />\nChina's evolution from a monarchy to the warlord period and<br />\neventually to the Cultural Revolution. In this fascinating, beautifully filmed piece, Bertolucci examines the evolution of a man<br />\nwrestling with the forces of tradition and reform, as well as a<br />\ncountry struggling to forge a<br />\nmore modern identity.<br />\nThe film opens with Pu Yi being taken to a detention camp for<br />\npolitical prisoners of the cultural<br />\nrevolution. His life story emerges<br />\nthrough his confession. Pu Yi<br />\nlives his childhood in the Forbidden City, a palace with hundreds<br />\nof eunochs and servants in<br />\nretinue. He lives the life of luxury and abandon, and quickly<br />\nlearns that his impudence has no<br />\nlimits and he can do what he<br />\nwants. At age six, Pu Yi learns<br />\nthat China has become a republic<br />\nand he is emperor only in the Forbidden City. His life remains unchanged, his arrogance growing<br />\ndaily, until he gets a tutor. This<br />\ntutor (Peter O'Toole) becomes a<br />\ngood friend to Pu Yi and teaches<br />\n<br />\nhim about the West. As a<br />\nteenager, the emperor becomes<br />\nincreasingly dissatisfied with being held a virtual prisoner in his<br />\nown palace. He yearns to run<br />\naway to Oxford. But, he is persuaded to stay, and eventually<br />\ngets married to a young princess<br />\nin an arranged marriage.<br />\nTogether they vow to become<br />\n\"modern.\" He expells the<br />\neunochs and learns to play tennis.<br />\nThe Chinese revolutionaries<br />\nbarge in on one such tennis match<br />\nin the Forbidden City, and Pu Yi<br />\nis expelled, stripped of his title.<br />\nHe becomes a playboy, and there<br />\nis a strikingly absurd scene where<br />\nPu Yi (dressed in a tuxedo with<br />\nhis hair slicked back in western<br />\nfashion) croons to a fashionable<br />\naudience \"Am I Blue. . .\"Eventually, the Japanese enlist his help<br />\nto invade Manchuria. Thinking<br />\nhe could regain some of his pride<br />\nand return to his native Manchuria, Pu Yi accepts. It is obvious that he is being<br />\nmanipulated, and the events that<br />\nfinally lead him to the detention<br />\ncamp are tragic.<br />\nPu Yi's life was truly extraordinary. He is an unsympathetic<br />\ncharacter, both arrogant and<br />\npathetic. Yet there is something<br />\nnoble about Pu Yi; if perhaps you<br />\ndon't identify with him, you at<br />\nleast understand him. John Lone<br />\n<br />\nplays the role with extreme<br />\nfinesse and understatement.<br />\nUnlike other epic actors, Lone<br />\ndoesn't \"milk\" the role. His approach is subtle, and all the more<br />\neffective for it. The supporting<br />\nactors, Peter O'Toole, Pu Yi's<br />\nwife playced by Chinese native<br />\nJoan Chen, and others also performed admirably.<br />\nApproaching a politically<br />\nvolatile period of history, Bertolucci thankfully eschews the<br />\ntraditional Spielberg pointing of<br />\nfingers and takes a more subtle<br />\napproach. He does not play<br />\nfavorites with any of the various<br />\ngovernments portrayed. Instead<br />\nhe shows them all to be vaguely<br />\nsimilar, composed of the same<br />\nelements; familiar faces but different names.<br />\n\"The Last Emperor\" is<br />\nskillfully crafted. It manages to<br />\nencompass a huge time period<br />\nand a wide scope while still paying immaculate attention to detail.<br />\nMany historical films seem like<br />\nhighlights but this film takes the<br />\ntime to develop characters and<br />\nsub-plots while avoiding sum<br />\nmanes. Bertolucci has created a<br />\nfascinating look at the extraordinary life of Pu Yi, a man<br />\ndisplaced in time, and the recent<br />\nhistory of a country balancing its<br />\npast with its modern ideals.<br />\n<br />\nThe Flip Side by Phil Gochenour<br />\nWell gang, here we are, back<br />\nat the ol' grind.

But<br />\nJohn Doe, Exene, and all the rest<br />\nof the guys are back with one of<br />\nthe crunchin'st albums of the<br />\nyear. The socio-political message<br />\nof the title track rings a bit<br />\nhollow, but this is more than<br />\nmade up for in the sheer poetry<br />\nof \"Fourth of July\" and the<br />\nguitar fury of \"I'm Lost.\" Still<br />\nmasters of the romantic ballad,<br />\nthis should be in everybody's<br />\ncollection.<br />\nINXS\u2014Kick. The band from<br />\nDown Under serves up a slaverin'<br />\nslice o' sex on black vinyl. This<br />\nis the hottest album I've heard in<br />\na while, both because of Micheal<br />\nHutchence's Mick Jaggerisms,<br />\nand the band's ability to lay down<br />\n<br />\nsome of the funkiest rhythms ever<br />\nheard. Brilliantly produced by<br />\nChris Thomas. Micheal Hutchence is the new Jim Morris/Mick Jagger rock n' roll sex<br />\ngod.<br />\nTom Waits\u2014Frank's Wild<br />\nYears.. Like Charles Bukowski<br />\nand Thomas Pynchon, Waits is<br />\nthe champion of the disaffected,<br />\nand this new album is a long and<br />\nhard look into the dreams, fears,<br />\nand fantasies of Frank, the<br />\neveryman proletarian.

On trombone is George<br />\nBrandon. On piano is Chris<br />\nEngle. Geir Magnusson plays<br />\nbass whenever his patchcord lets<br />\nhim. Jeremy Blynn is a freshman<br />\nsensation on drums; Andy Rieser<br />\ngets by on drums as well,<br />\nalthough he wishes he could read<br />\nmusic better.<br />\nThose who came to the<br />\nDecember 7 concert will<br />\nremember the energy of the first<br />\narrangement, \"Top Score,\"<br />\nfollowed by the appropriately<br />\nnamed \u2014 Basically Blues.\" \"St.<br />\nThomas\" was next, featuring<br />\nbright and cheery solos by virtually everyone in the band.

Actually, it was an exasperated Andy Rieser who threw<br />\nhis sticks into the crowd, crying<br />\n\"I'll never play drums again!\")<br />\nFun was had by all.<br />\nIn conclusion, I'd like to encourage everyone interested in<br />\ngoed music, played by your<br />\nfellow Hopkins students, to look<br />\nout for the next performance of<br />\nthe Jazz Ensemble.

Stewart<br />\nIt's 10:30 or so when I arrive<br />\nat St. John's church with a few<br />\nfriends. Two Legs, tonight's<br />\nfeature band, has finished its first<br />\nset. People are milling about,<br />\ntalking and drinking cold beer.<br />\nThey look hot.<br />\nThe hall where the band has set<br />\nup is immense. The ceiling is<br />\nnearly thirty or forty feet high<br />\nwith an open parachute hanging<br />\nfrom the rafters. Colorful handmade banners decorate the wall<br />\nwith humanist slogans. There are<br />\nonly a few lights on, making the<br />\nhall suitably dark for uninhibited<br />\ndancing.<br />\nTwo Legs comes on but I'm<br />\nonly halfway through the bottle of<br />\nEast German (or so I'm told) beer<br />\nthat I bought at a corner table for<br />\nonly $1.25. It's pretty good beer<br />\nand I decide to finish before joining my friends who are already<br />\nup and ready to start jumping<br />\naround.<br />\nI scope out the band's equipment as they tune up; it's a bad<br />\nhabit I have. Usually I get really<br />\njealous when I see a band's equipment, probably because I don't<br />\nhave anything and wish I did. Not<br />\ntonight. The drum kit's an old<br />\nfour piece rig, the amplifiers are<br />\nsmall, the keyboards consist of an<br />\nelectric piano and an accordian(?), and the P.A. looks like<br />\nsomeone's home stereo. So I'm<br />\nnot impressed.<br />\nThey start playing and my<br />\nmaterialistic mood is quickly<br />\ndispelled. The drummer lays<br />\ndown the beat, hard and fast. The<br />\nbassist locks in on the kick, playing a busy low frequency figure.<br />\nGuitar and accordian compete for<br />\nthe lead, easing off now and then<br />\nto let some vocals or saxophone<br />\ninto the picture. By the third or<br />\nfourth song I realize the tempo<br />\nhasn't slowed down so much as<br />\n<br />\na beat and the band has only now<br />\nbroken a sweat. My friends are<br />\npanting and perspiring as they try<br />\nto keep up. My beer is warm so<br />\nI decide, what the hell I may as<br />\nwell join them.<br />\nI start into my standard<br />\nCignels/Depot/Man Ray hip-andshoulder gyration, figuring the<br />\ntempo should be about the same<br />\nas your average English arty<br />\ndisco record. I'm not sure why \u2022<br />\nexactly but it turns out I'm completely wrong. It feels like there<br />\nisn't enough room between beats.<br />\nIt's almost impossible to look<br />\ncool and sophisticated while dancing to this music. So what. I end<br />\nup doing this weird cross between<br />\na polka and The Turkey-And-The<br />\n-Straw. After two songs I'm completely exhausted (as though I<br />\nwasn't already before I got there)<br />\nand flop down on one of the<br />\nfolding chairs they've got set up<br />\ntowards the back.<br />\nIf I were to analyze exactly<br />\nwhat's going on in Two Legs'<br />\nmusic I would have to launch into a lengthy discourse on the<br />\nvarious kinds of rhythms they incorporate. But because I'm still<br />\nreally tired, I'll just mention<br />\nterms like ska, zydeco, rockabilly, and polka. If you've listened<br />\nto any of these kinds of music<br />\nyou'll have some idea of how this<br />\n(guitar/bass/drums/piano/accordian/baritone saxophone) band<br />\nsounds. If you haven't then you'll<br />\nhave to go see them when they<br />\nplay St. Johns(corner of 27th and<br />\nSt. Paul) again this Friday the<br />\n29th. They usually start at 9 or<br />\n9:30 and play until 12 when they<br />\nhave to stop. For only $3 you can<br />\navoid the stigma of rhythmic ignorance. Judging from the<br />\namount of fun last Friday's audience seemed to have, I would<br />\nthink such an educational experience worthwhile.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\n<br />\nAssimilation of<br />\nWorld music in Shriver Hall<br />\nby Andrew Rieser<br />\nIndividual expression in jazz<br />\nmusic was brought to its farthest<br />\nextent with the collective improvisations of the \"free-jazz\" of<br />\nthe '60's. Artists such as John<br />\nColtrane and Ornette Coleman<br />\nremoved such boundaries as time,<br />\nmeter, harmony and even melody<br />\nand used raw musical energy to<br />\ncreate excitement and mood. In<br />\nthe late 60's and early 70's, fusion artists Miles Davis and John<br />\nMclaughlin tamed the wild<br />\nenergy of free-jazz and applied it<br />\nto the instruments and rhythm of<br />\nrock music. It was a natural<br />\nassimilation of past and present<br />\nmusical styles. Since then,<br />\nbreakthroughs in jazz have drawn<br />\non this process of assimilation of<br />\ndifferent musical styles. Musicians today have access to \"world<br />\nmusic,\" from Indian to Chinese,<br />\nfrom popular Western Rock to<br />\nthe complex polyrhythms of<br />\nAfrican music. Today's global<br />\ncommunications network makes<br />\nthis assimilation possible.<br />\nOn December 10, Johns<br />\nHopkins was treated to a spectacular performance by one of the<br />\nforerunners of the world<br />\nassimilist movement, Al<br />\nDimeola. His immensely popular<br />\nwork during the 70's in Chick<br />\nCorea's \"Think of One\" group<br />\nrelied on fast, complicated<br />\nmusical athletics and intense interplay. His unmistakable right<br />\nhand is still there, but he incorporates his speed and technique<br />\ninto commercially smooth compositions. Like most \"New Age\"<br />\nartists, he now seems more interested in mood and aesthetics to<br />\naffect his audience, rather than attempting to do the impossible, via<br />\nunbelievable intricate compositions, involving linear interplay<br />\nwithin the Think of One band.<br />\nHe appeared in Shriver Hall as.<br />\na sort of baby-boomer intellectual, with steel rimmed glasses,<br />\nhair tied back, and a sport coat.<br />\nThe stage was filled with electronic paraphenalia usually<br />\nassociated with popular music\u2014<br />\nkeyboards, large drumkit, extensive percussion and two towers of<br />\nstage lighting. His musicians<br />\nwere an assimilation of musical<br />\n<br />\ncultures: Kei Akagi on keyboards<br />\nrepresented Japan, Jose Renato<br />\nfrom Brazil sang vocals,<br />\nAmericans played bass, percussion and drums, respectively<br />\nChuck Webb, Roger Squitero,<br />\nand Tom Brechtlein. Mr. Akagi<br />\nshowed remarkable technique and<br />\nenergy. He shined during the<br />\nballad \"Smile for a Stranger,\"<br />\nplayfully exchanging phrases<br />\nwith has bandleader (who is certainly no stranger to improvisational piano/guitar duets.) Jose<br />\nRenato's soaring vocals added<br />\nflavor and legitimacy to<br />\nlatin-flavored<br />\nDimeola's<br />\nrhythms. Chuck Webb provided<br />\nthe funky foundations necessary<br />\nto any good fusion band. Handsome Roger Squitero added<br />\nvisual excitement to the show. He<br />\nworked his huge array of exotic<br />\npercussion into Dimeola's compositions in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Drummer Tom<br />\nBrechtein was outstanding during<br />\nthe entire show, injecting colorful and intriguing rhythms into<br />\neach band member's solo. His<br />\nown solo contained elements of<br />\nSteve Gadd, revealing his own<br />\nNew York background.<br />\nDuring his unaccompanied<br />\nsolo, however, Dimeola dropped<br />\nhis new commercially processed<br />\npop-fusion sound in favor of his<br />\nflamenco/jazz expertise. He effortlessly played 32nd notes,<br />\nrecalling his earlier solos in<br />\n\"Elegant Gypsy\" and \"Land of<br />\nthe Midnight Sun,\" with his own<br />\nstudio bands. It was Al Dimeola<br />\nat his best, playing Spanish influenced phrases that welded into dangling chords, disappearing<br />\ninto the silence of an enraptured<br />\naudience.<br />\nHis attempt to incorporate latin<br />\nrhythms, exotic percussion and<br />\nelectronic synthesizers into his<br />\nown flamenco/jazz background<br />\nhas been commercially successfull, as he no doubt intended.<br />\nHowever, electronics don't<br />\ncreate. Correctly used they can<br />\nincrease a musician's vocabulary<br />\nof sounds and mood.

Zig 6a1a Enb-of-Vear Mailbag<br />\nOui3 recieved more entries than ANY other end-of-year quiz. That would<br />\nmean that my tiny vision was fulfilled, would it not. No it would not. Guys<br />\nand dames, it was holiday time, and the QM extended his holiday wishes<br />\nto all, but received nary a card from the 'zlings. And to make matters worse,<br />\none entry said that there were only 16 questions because the QM is lazy and,<br />\nI quote, \"Wanted to get Chinese food 8c. watch The Cosby Show.\" First of<br />\nall, the QM is not lazy, rather feckless maybe, but not lazy. Second, Cosby<br />\nwas a repeat, and it was being taped on the VCR. Even more surprising was<br />\nthat three different entries told me that 16 was the age of consent. Thanks<br />\nfor the tip guys, but what the HELL does that have to do with the holidays?<br />\n'A little advice though, use that logic for the long, and I mean long, awaited<br />\nValentine's Day Sex Quiz. By the way, if anyone is at all offended by my<br />\neditorializing and abuse of the Queen's English, the QM has but one thing<br />\nto say, \"Well, excuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me!!!\" Get your entries to the N-L construction site by Wednesday 2-3-88 at 5 p.m.<br />\nMelissa HM Wu and Dawn<br />\nResults: And the winners are<br />\nStephens.

Oh by the way, the 16th was the first day of Chanukah, and one<br />\nsuper 'zling realized that 16 was the number of days between Chanukah and<br />\nNew Year's. The QM was awed.

The<br />\nSchool's problems, said Lombardi, are aggravated by by the size of the faculty, which<br />\nis large relative to the School's income.<br />\nA further problem stems from the ongoing<br />\ncampus renovations; when planned, in 1985,<br />\nit was intended that the costs incurred by these<br />\nrenovations would be allocated to the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences. While this did not seems<br />\nto present any problems at the time, the School<br />\nhas since seen a decrease in its cost recovery<br />\nbase; thus the School is face-to-face with a longterm debt which it is increasingly less able to<br />\nhandle.<br />\nLombardi said that the School has thus<br />\nestablished a \"suspension of committments.\"<br />\nThis involves a temporary freeze on hiring and<br />\nthe purchasing of equipment.<br />\nThe freeze may be a dangerous move. According to the Council, this is the second such<br />\nfreeze in ten years; Council members fear that<br />\nthis might undermine the School's programs<br />\nand be detrimental to the University's reputation in the long run.

He ambitiously and<br />\nenergetically drew students into the writing program and was rewarded with the popularity and<br />\nsuccess of the department.<br />\nIt is ironic that the L/V Room should become<br /><br />\nthe Arellano Theater because his efforts toward<br />\nimproving the L/V Room's theatrical<br />\ncapabilities went largely unrewarded. Arellano<br />\ntried for years to secure for the Room a decent<br />\nsound system, sound insulation (to facilitate<br />\ncoordinating events in the Glass Pavilion and<br />\nin Levering) and even spotlights.<br />\nThe naming of the Arellano Theater pays<br />\ntribute to the man and his devotion and his<br />\nachievements. An even greater tribute to his<br />\nlegacy would be to carry out those renovations<br />\nfor which he fought; certainly Arellano would<br />\nhave preferred new facilities to a new name.<br /><br />\nNews,Letter<br />\nEditors<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nFlory Ware, Lisa Weisbord<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nLayout Editors<br />\nEly Brown, Jonathan Engler<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

Being a foolhardy<br />\nfreshman, I volunteered to take<br />\nhis place and write a weekly<br />\neditorial.<br />\nSo here I sit at my word processor, watching the snow fall<br />\noutside, wrestling with writer's<br />\nblock at this early stage of my<br />\ncareer. I ask my roommate how<br />\nhe would start a new column, but<br />\nhe doesn't hear me because he is<br />\nlistening to some music in<br />\nChinese. It looks like I'm on my<br />\nown. So I think about the green<br />\nthing I ate for dinner.

Of course, everyone<br />\nknows that there are several ways<br />\nnot to begin a new column, the<br />\nmost prominent of which being<br />\nharping on the administration,<br />\nSeiler's, Baltimore, Barnes and<br />\nNoble, or the Coalition, because<br />\nno one wants to hear about them<br />\nanymore. At least not before the<br />\ntuition raises are announced.<br />\nI could write a creative and<br />\nhumorous exposition on how I<br />\nhate it when those little pieces of<br />\ngravel that they put on the ice gets<br />\nstuck in Ty tennis shoes, or that<br /><br />\nneat trick I learned with salt and<br />\nglasses. I picked up some great<br />\nanecdotes watching PBS recently that my once and future readers<br />\nmay find interesting, amusing,<br />\nand even provocative, that I could<br />\nprint here. I should complain, that<br />\nin the past two days I've been<br />\nasked three times whether I'm a<br />\nmed student when people I've<br />\nmet learned I'm from Hopkins.<br />\nBut I think THE BEST WAY<br />\nNOT TO START A NEW COLUMN AT JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nwould be by not ragging on<br /><br />\nLittle More Leeway<br />\nLEE, from 10<br />\ncouldn't count that either, as Asa<br />\ntook the opportunity to deliver not<br />\nan unclenched hand but a bloodletting blow to my nose.

It<br />\nspans half a century, tracing<br />\nChina's evolution from a monarchy to the warlord period and<br />\neventually to the Cultural Revolution. In this fascinating, beautifully filmed piece, Bertolucci examines the evolution of a man<br />\nwrestling with the forces of tradition and reform, as well as a<br />\ncountry struggling to forge a<br />\nmore modern identity.<br />\nThe film opens with Pu Yi being taken to a detention camp for<br />\npolitical prisoners of the cultural<br />\nrevolution. His life story emerges<br />\nthrough his confession. Pu Yi<br />\nlives his childhood in the Forbidden City, a palace with hundreds<br />\nof eunochs and servants in<br />\nretinue. He lives the life of luxury and abandon, and quickly<br />\nlearns that his impudence has no<br />\nlimits and he can do what he<br />\nwants. At age six, Pu Yi learns<br />\nthat China has become a republic<br />\nand he is emperor only in the Forbidden City. His life remains unchanged, his arrogance growing<br />\ndaily, until he gets a tutor. This<br />\ntutor (Peter O'Toole) becomes a<br />\ngood friend to Pu Yi and teaches<br /><br />\nhim about the West. As a<br />\nteenager, the emperor becomes<br />\nincreasingly dissatisfied with being held a virtual prisoner in his<br />\nown palace. He yearns to run<br />\naway to Oxford.

Thinking<br />\nhe could regain some of his pride<br />\nand return to his native Manchuria, Pu Yi accepts. It is obvious that he is being<br />\nmanipulated, and the events that<br />\nfinally lead him to the detention<br />\ncamp are tragic.<br />\nPu Yi's life was truly extraordinary. He is an unsympathetic<br />\ncharacter, both arrogant and<br />\npathetic. Yet there is something<br />\nnoble about Pu Yi; if perhaps you<br />\ndon't identify with him, you at<br />\nleast understand him. John Lone<br /><br />\nplays the role with extreme<br />\nfinesse and understatement.<br />\nUnlike other epic actors, Lone<br />\ndoesn't \"milk\" the role.

Bertolucci has created a<br />\nfascinating look at the extraordinary life of Pu Yi, a man<br />\ndisplaced in time, and the recent<br />\nhistory of a country balancing its<br />\npast with its modern ideals.<br /><br />\nThe Flip Side by Phil Gochenour<br />\nWell gang, here we are, back<br />\nat the ol' grind.

After<br />\nwhat looked like the sell-out of<br /><br />\nAin't Love Grand, and the departure of Billy Zoom, guitarist,(and<br />\nlater, Dave Alvin) it all seemed<br />\nto be over for one of L.A.'s<br />\npremiere underground bands. But<br />\nJohn Doe, Exene, and all the rest<br />\nof the guys are back with one of<br />\nthe crunchin'st albums of the<br />\nyear. The socio-political message<br />\nof the title track rings a bit<br />\nhollow, but this is more than<br />\nmade up for in the sheer poetry<br />\nof \"Fourth of July\" and the<br />\nguitar fury of \"I'm Lost.\" Still<br />\nmasters of the romantic ballad,<br />\nthis should be in everybody's<br />\ncollection.<br />\nINXS\u2014Kick. The band from<br />\nDown Under serves up a slaverin'<br />\nslice o' sex on black vinyl. This<br />\nis the hottest album I've heard in<br />\na while, both because of Micheal<br />\nHutchence's Mick Jaggerisms,<br />\nand the band's ability to lay down<br /><br />\nsome of the funkiest rhythms ever<br />\nheard. Brilliantly produced by<br />\nChris Thomas. Micheal Hutchence is the new Jim Morris/Mick Jagger rock n' roll sex<br />\ngod.<br />\nTom Waits\u2014Frank's Wild<br />\nYears.. Like Charles Bukowski<br />\nand Thomas Pynchon, Waits is<br />\nthe champion of the disaffected,<br />\nand this new album is a long and<br />\nhard look into the dreams, fears,<br />\nand fantasies of Frank, the<br />\neveryman proletarian. Sleazy,<br />\nbluesy, and sexy, this is the music<br />\nto drink Thunderbird to.<br />\nSonic Youth\u2014Sister. Just when<br />\nyou think that everything has<br />\nbeen done, bands like Sonic<br />\nYouth come along and show you<br />\nwhat's left.

On trombone is George<br />\nBrandon. On piano is Chris<br />\nEngle. Geir Magnusson plays<br />\nbass whenever his patchcord lets<br />\nhim. Jeremy Blynn is a freshman<br />\nsensation on drums; Andy Rieser<br />\ngets by on drums as well,<br />\nalthough he wishes he could read<br />\nmusic better.<br />\nThose who came to the<br />\nDecember 7 concert will<br />\nremember the energy of the first<br />\narrangement, \"Top Score,\"<br />\nfollowed by the appropriately<br />\nnamed \u2014 Basically Blues.\" \"St.<br />\nThomas\" was next, featuring<br />\nbright and cheery solos by virtually everyone in the band. On<br />\na quieter note was \"Early<br />\nAutumn\" and \"In A Mellow<br />\nTone,\" followed by the hectic<br />\nDuke Ellington composition<br />\n\"Caravan.\" Rounding up the<br />\nevening was a jazz arrangement<br /><br />\nof the Children's Television<br />\nWorkshop's theme song \"Sesame<br />\nStreet,\" featuring solos by three<br />\nof Hopkins' finest soloists:<br />\nHeavner, Greenfield and Blynn.<br />\nJeremy impressed everyone with<br />\na spectacular five minute display<br />\nof drum expertise.

Actually, it was an exasperated Andy Rieser who threw<br />\nhis sticks into the crowd, crying<br />\n\"I'll never play drums again!\")<br />\nFun was had by all.<br />\nIn conclusion, I'd like to encourage everyone interested in<br />\ngoed music, played by your<br />\nfellow Hopkins students, to look<br />\nout for the next performance of<br />\nthe Jazz Ensemble.

Stewart<br />\nIt's 10:30 or so when I arrive<br />\nat St. John's church with a few<br />\nfriends. Two Legs, tonight's<br />\nfeature band, has finished its first<br />\nset. People are milling about,<br />\ntalking and drinking cold beer.<br />\nThey look hot.<br />\nThe hall where the band has set<br />\nup is immense. The ceiling is<br />\nnearly thirty or forty feet high<br />\nwith an open parachute hanging<br />\nfrom the rafters. Colorful handmade banners decorate the wall<br />\nwith humanist slogans. There are<br />\nonly a few lights on, making the<br />\nhall suitably dark for uninhibited<br />\ndancing.<br />\nTwo Legs comes on but I'm<br />\nonly halfway through the bottle of<br />\nEast German (or so I'm told) beer<br />\nthat I bought at a corner table for<br />\nonly $1.25. It's pretty good beer<br />\nand I decide to finish before joining my friends who are already<br />\nup and ready to start jumping<br />\naround.<br />\nI scope out the band's equipment as they tune up; it's a bad<br />\nhabit I have. Usually I get really<br />\njealous when I see a band's equipment, probably because I don't<br />\nhave anything and wish I did. Not<br />\ntonight. The drum kit's an old<br />\nfour piece rig, the amplifiers are<br />\nsmall, the keyboards consist of an<br />\nelectric piano and an accordian(?), and the P.A. looks like<br />\nsomeone's home stereo. So I'm<br />\nnot impressed.<br />\nThey start playing and my<br />\nmaterialistic mood is quickly<br />\ndispelled. The drummer lays<br />\ndown the beat, hard and fast. The<br />\nbassist locks in on the kick, playing a busy low frequency figure.<br />\nGuitar and accordian compete for<br />\nthe lead, easing off now and then<br />\nto let some vocals or saxophone<br />\ninto the picture. By the third or<br />\nfourth song I realize the tempo<br />\nhasn't slowed down so much as<br /><br />\na beat and the band has only now<br />\nbroken a sweat. My friends are<br />\npanting and perspiring as they try<br />\nto keep up. My beer is warm so<br />\nI decide, what the hell I may as<br />\nwell join them.<br />\nI start into my standard<br />\nCignels/Depot/Man Ray hip-andshoulder gyration, figuring the<br />\ntempo should be about the same<br />\nas your average English arty<br />\ndisco record. I'm not sure why \u2022<br />\nexactly but it turns out I'm completely wrong. It feels like there<br />\nisn't enough room between beats.<br />\nIt's almost impossible to look<br />\ncool and sophisticated while dancing to this music. So what. I end<br />\nup doing this weird cross between<br />\na polka and The Turkey-And-The<br />\n-Straw. After two songs I'm completely exhausted (as though I<br />\nwasn't already before I got there)<br />\nand flop down on one of the<br />\nfolding chairs they've got set up<br />\ntowards the back.<br />\nIf I were to analyze exactly<br />\nwhat's going on in Two Legs'<br />\nmusic I would have to launch into a lengthy discourse on the<br />\nvarious kinds of rhythms they incorporate. But because I'm still<br />\nreally tired, I'll just mention<br />\nterms like ska, zydeco, rockabilly, and polka. If you've listened<br />\nto any of these kinds of music<br />\nyou'll have some idea of how this<br />\n(guitar/bass/drums/piano/accordian/baritone saxophone) band<br />\nsounds. If you haven't then you'll<br />\nhave to go see them when they<br />\nplay St. Johns(corner of 27th and<br />\nSt. Paul) again this Friday the<br />\n29th. They usually start at 9 or<br />\n9:30 and play until 12 when they<br />\nhave to stop. For only $3 you can<br />\navoid the stigma of rhythmic ignorance. Judging from the<br />\namount of fun last Friday's audience seemed to have, I would<br />\nthink such an educational experience worthwhile.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br /><br />\nAssimilation of<br />\nWorld music in Shriver Hall<br />\nby Andrew Rieser<br />\nIndividual expression in jazz<br />\nmusic was brought to its farthest<br />\nextent with the collective improvisations of the \"free-jazz\" of<br />\nthe '60's. Artists such as John<br />\nColtrane and Ornette Coleman<br />\nremoved such boundaries as time,<br />\nmeter, harmony and even melody<br />\nand used raw musical energy to<br />\ncreate excitement and mood. In<br />\nthe late 60's and early 70's, fusion artists Miles Davis and John<br />\nMclaughlin tamed the wild<br />\nenergy of free-jazz and applied it<br />\nto the instruments and rhythm of<br />\nrock music. It was a natural<br />\nassimilation of past and present<br />\nmusical styles. Since then,<br />\nbreakthroughs in jazz have drawn<br />\non this process of assimilation of<br />\ndifferent musical styles. Musicians today have access to \"world<br />\nmusic,\" from Indian to Chinese,<br />\nfrom popular Western Rock to<br />\nthe complex polyrhythms of<br />\nAfrican music. Today's global<br />\ncommunications network makes<br />\nthis assimilation possible.<br />\nOn December 10, Johns<br />\nHopkins was treated to a spectacular performance by one of the<br />\nforerunners of the world<br />\nassimilist movement, Al<br />\nDimeola. His immensely popular<br />\nwork during the 70's in Chick<br />\nCorea's \"Think of One\" group<br />\nrelied on fast, complicated<br />\nmusical athletics and intense interplay. His unmistakable right<br />\nhand is still there, but he incorporates his speed and technique<br />\ninto commercially smooth compositions. Like most \"New Age\"<br />\nartists, he now seems more interested in mood and aesthetics to<br />\naffect his audience, rather than attempting to do the impossible, via<br />\nunbelievable intricate compositions, involving linear interplay<br />\nwithin the Think of One band.<br />\nHe appeared in Shriver Hall as.<br />\na sort of baby-boomer intellectual, with steel rimmed glasses,<br />\nhair tied back, and a sport coat.<br />\nThe stage was filled with electronic paraphenalia usually<br />\nassociated with popular music\u2014<br />\nkeyboards, large drumkit, extensive percussion and two towers of<br />\nstage lighting. His musicians<br />\nwere an assimilation of musical<br /><br />\ncultures: Kei Akagi on keyboards<br />\nrepresented Japan, Jose Renato<br />\nfrom Brazil sang vocals,<br />\nAmericans played bass, percussion and drums, respectively<br />\nChuck Webb, Roger Squitero,<br />\nand Tom Brechtlein. Mr. Akagi<br />\nshowed remarkable technique and<br />\nenergy. He shined during the<br />\nballad \"Smile for a Stranger,\"<br />\nplayfully exchanging phrases<br />\nwith has bandleader (who is certainly no stranger to improvisational piano/guitar duets.) Jose<br />\nRenato's soaring vocals added<br />\nflavor and legitimacy to<br />\nlatin-flavored<br />\nDimeola's<br />\nrhythms. Chuck Webb provided<br />\nthe funky foundations necessary<br />\nto any good fusion band. Handsome Roger Squitero added<br />\nvisual excitement to the show. He<br />\nworked his huge array of exotic<br />\npercussion into Dimeola's compositions in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Drummer Tom<br />\nBrechtein was outstanding during<br />\nthe entire show, injecting colorful and intriguing rhythms into<br />\neach band member's solo. His<br />\nown solo contained elements of<br />\nSteve Gadd, revealing his own<br />\nNew York background.<br />\nDuring his unaccompanied<br />\nsolo, however, Dimeola dropped<br />\nhis new commercially processed<br />\npop-fusion sound in favor of his<br />\nflamenco/jazz expertise. He effortlessly played 32nd notes,<br />\nrecalling his earlier solos in<br />\n\"Elegant Gypsy\" and \"Land of<br />\nthe Midnight Sun,\" with his own<br />\nstudio bands. It was Al Dimeola<br />\nat his best, playing Spanish influenced phrases that welded into dangling chords, disappearing<br />\ninto the silence of an enraptured<br />\naudience.<br />\nHis attempt to incorporate latin<br />\nrhythms, exotic percussion and<br />\nelectronic synthesizers into his<br />\nown flamenco/jazz background<br />\nhas been commercially successfull, as he no doubt intended.<br />\nHowever, electronics don't<br />\ncreate. Correctly used they can<br />\nincrease a musician's vocabulary<br />\nof sounds and mood.
