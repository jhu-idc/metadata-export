But he may well<br />\nhave opened the Administration to much<br />\nmore criticism than he ever expected in<br />\nthose turbulent days last semester.<br />\nThis week, the Committee on Freedom<br />\nof Expression, chaired by Richard<br />\nFlathman of the department of political<br />\nscience, released the first draft of its report<br />\nwhich harshly criticizes the University for<br />\nits \"aberrant action\" in the arrest of shantybuilders and demolition of a protest shanty. The report also proposes a Statement<br />\nof Principle and Practice that goes far<br />\nbeyond present University policy in defending and \"fostering\" freedom of<br />\nexpression.<br />\nIn both its substance and language, the<br />\nreport is undoubtedly one of the most<br />\ncourageous documents to emerge from the<br />\nUniversity in recent memory and is a credit<br />\nto the University and the committee that<br />\nproduced it.<br />\nIn forming the report (printed in its entirety elsewhere on these pages) the Committee on Freedom of Expression made a<br />\nsharp departure form the traditional University line at a number of points.<br />\nFirst, the report insists that the University must protect and foster all forms of expression \"so long as neither physical injury to persons nor significant damage to<br />\nproperty is inflicted.\" Until now, University officials have argued that potential<br />\nthreats to personal safety (like fires and<br />\nshanty-attacks) outweigh rights to freedom<br />\nof expression. The report seems to have<br />\ntaken the contrary position.<br />\nFurthermore, the report stresses the<br />\nresponsibility of the University to \"make<br />\nspecial efforts\" to accomodate expression<br />\nof ideas particularly when those ideas are<br />\nrepugnant to some members of the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nBeyond its nearly unconditional defense<br />\nof freedom of expression, the report of the<br />\n<br />\nCommittee also calls for a rather sweeping procedural change in dealing with<br />\nfreedom of expression issues.<br />\nDuring last semester's confrontations, the<br />\nExecutive Committee of the Board of<br />\nTrustees took the lead in setting University policy with regard to freedom of speech<br />\nissues. It was the Executive Committee, for<br />\nexample, that \"outlawed\" the construction<br />\nof shanties in a curt policy statement in the<br />\nGazette. Later, the Executive Committee<br />\nreversed its shanty-ban in a late-night<br />\nmeeting after the arrest of fourteen<br />\nprotestors.<br />\nThe Committee on Freedom of Expression, however, recommends that the<br />\nauthority to deal with freedom of speech<br />\nissues be vested not in the Executive Committee, but rather in the Academic Council.<br />\nSpecifically, the Committee urges the<br />\nAcademic Council to form an \"Ad Hoc Committee of faculty and students\" when difficulty arises \"in the implementation of the<br />\nprinciple of freedom of expression.\"<br />\nThe procedural change recommended by<br />\nthe Committee on Freedom of Expression<br />\nis an important one. If enacted, it would<br />\ntake the authority to deal with problems of<br />\nfreedom of expression out of the hands of<br />\na committee which has traditionally been<br />\nsomewhat aloof(and rightly so) from the<br />\nday to day happenings on campus, and<br />\nplace that authority in a much more accessible body.<br />\nFurthermore, the procedure recommended by the Committee on Freedom of Expression would allow, for once, real opportunities for student input into the resolution<br />\nof problems relating to freedom of<br />\nexpression.<br />\nOn the whole, the Statement of Principle and Practice outlined in the Committee's report merits prompt consideration.<br />\nLike the Committee on Freedom of Expression, we urge the Academic Council, President and Board of Trustees to adopt the<br />\nStatement of Principle and Practice formally as a policy of the University. And, we<br />\ncongratulate the Committee on Freedom of<br />\nExpression for a job well done.<br />\n<br />\nImage-Polishing<br />\nIt's clear that this semester has gotten off<br />\nto a less dramatic start than last semester.<br />\nIn the absence of arrests, trials and protests,<br />\nthe new semester hardly seems thrilling.<br />\nNevertheless, important work is waiting to<br />\nbe done. It's time Council started worrying about it.<br />\nLast week, we urged Council to use the<br />\nrelative calm of the new semester to set a<br />\ndetailed agenda of priorities. We suggested<br />\nthat the SAC seals, social programming and<br />\nsecurity would be appropriate for such an<br />\nagenda. Undoubtedly, there are other issues<br />\nwhich merit attention like responding to the<br />\nconclusions of the Committee on Free Expression and redefining the role of the<br />\nCOC.<br />\nNevertheless, despite the range of work<br />\nwaiting to be done, Council used its most<br />\nrecent session not to address the work at<br />\nhand but to debate, of all things, its own<br />\n<br />\nimage in the media.<br />\nDuring an hour and a half long meeting,<br />\ndiscussion was devoted almost exclusively<br />\nto News-Letter coverage of Council's activities and to criticisms made on these<br />\npages last week. Council concluded that the<br />\nNews-Letter has created \"negative feelings\" and decided to investigate the<br />\npossibility of writing its own reports of SC<br />\nactivities\u2014presumably those reports will be<br />\nnicer.<br />\nWe hope that after its lengthy debate<br />\nCouncil has now exhausted its interest in<br />\nitself and its image and will turn to the more<br />\nserious and productive business of serving<br />\nits constituency. We look forward to<br />\ndebates of more worthy issues in weeks to<br />\ncome. Perhaps with a docket of such issues<br />\nscheduled for debate, Council won't have<br />\nto worry about attracting a quorum of its<br />\nmembers to its meetings.<br />\n<br />\nOn Free Expression<br />\nThe following is the first draft<br />\nofthe report ofthe Committee on<br />\nFreedom of Expression chaired<br />\nby Professor Richard Flathman of<br />\nthe Department of Political<br />\nScience.<br />\nThe committee was formed in<br />\nearly October shortly after the arrest offourteen shanty-builders.<br />\nAt the time, University President<br />\nSteven Muller charged the committee with the responsibility of<br />\ninvestigating freedom of speech<br />\nissues.<br />\nReport Of The Committee<br />\nOn Freedom of Expression<br />\nPreamble<br />\n<br />\nThe Committee's concept of its<br />\ntask is influenced by the circumstances, both immediate and<br />\nlonger term, in which it was convened. In September of 1986, the<br />\nUniversity obtained a court injunction forbidding the construction on campus of structures intended to serve as symbols of a<br />\npolitical movement. (The structures were called \"shanties\" and<br />\nwere the chosen symbol of a<br />\nmovement, widespread in the<br />\nUnited States and elsewhere, to<br />\ncombat the Apartheid system in<br />\nSouth Africa.) Participants in the<br />\nmovement refused to obey the injunction, erected and refused to<br />\nremove a structure, and were arrested. Large numbers of students<br />\nand faculty protested these actions<br />\nby the University, claiming that<br />\nthey constituted unwarranted interference with freedom of expression in the University community. These protests led to the<br />\nappointment of this Committee.<br />\nThese events and hence the task<br />\nof this Committee must be seen<br />\nin the larger perspective of the<br />\nhistory of the Homewood Cam-<br />\n<br />\npus of the Johns Hopkins University. In obtaining and requesting<br />\nthe enforcement of an injunction<br />\nagainst a non-violent form of<br />\npolitical expression, the University took an action that is unprecedented in its specific<br />\ncharacter and a sharp departure<br />\nfrom the traditional commmitment of this University community to the protection and encouragement of the widest possible freedom of expression. The<br />\nvigor of the reaction against the<br />\nUniversity's aberrant action is<br />\nevidence that those commitments<br />\nremain firm throughout much of<br />\nthe University community.<br />\nIn this perspective, the primary<br />\ntask of the Committee is forcefully to reaffirm commitments that<br />\nare already widely accepted; to<br />\narticulate anew understandings<br />\nthat are fundamental to a university and that are among our<br />\nproudest traditions. Freedom of<br />\nexpression has been attacked<br />\nfrom many directions. The only<br />\neffective protection for it, finally, is a community convinced of<br />\nits fundamental importance.<br />\nThe Committee recommends<br />\nformal adoption, by the<br />\nAcademic Council, President,<br />\nand Board of Trustees, of the<br />\nfollowing Statement of Principle<br />\nas a fundamental norm of the<br />\nUniversity. The Committee further recommends institutionalization, at the Homewood Campus,<br />\nof the understandings and procedures contained in the following Statement of Practice. The<br />\nCommittee further recommends<br />\nthat the Statement of Principle<br />\nand Practice be included in all<br />\nfuture editions of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Arts and Sciences/<br />\nEngineering Catalogue and the<br />\nContinued on Page 9<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nTimothy McNamara<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nAaron Davis, Flory Ware<br />\nElizabeth Harrigan<br />\nKathleen McCarthy,Jon Stempel<br />\nLaurah Limbrick, Sue Trowbridge<br />\nJay Lechtman<br />\nEly Brown, Joseph Gergyes<br />\nVandana Kumra<br />\nChristopher Szeles, Adam Warner<br />\nDiana Zeiger<br />\nJess Bunshaft, Ganesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nEditor<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nFeatures Editor<br />\nScience Editor<br />\nBooks Editor<br />\nSports Editors<br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nPhoto Editors<br />\n<br />\nStaff Writers: Uri Ahn, L.

Is the routine of college<br />\nlife going to engulf you, along<br />\nwith the hordes of other<br />\nanonymous, apathetic individuals<br />\npopulating the campus? Take<br />\ntime out to do something rewarding and fun. For starters, check<br />\nout Johns Hopkins' Circle K<br />\nClub, which according to Jackie<br />\nMeister, \"combines leadership<br />\nand service with friendship and<br />\nfun.\" President Vandana Kumra<br />\nadds, \"It's the one club where<br />\nyou get the 'total college<br />\nexperience.\"<br />\nThe largest collegiate service<br />\norganization in the world, Circle<br />\nK involves itself in many activities, both on campus and in the<br />\ncommunity. With an already<br />\nsizeable membership of 40 and on<br />\nthe rise, the club abounds in fresh<br />\nideas, many of which are<br />\ndeveloped into full-fledged projects. While seemingly farfetched when jokingly proposed<br />\nat a meeting, Murat Akalin's<br />\nbrainstorm of a free hot chocolate<br />\ngiveaway on campus grew to be<br />\na bi-monthly occurrence. On Friday nights in the Freshman Quad,<br />\nyou may have come across a<br />\ngroup of fellow students braving<br />\nthe near-freezing temperatures to<br />\nproffer cups of steaming hot<br />\nchocolate at no cost. Says Swati<br />\nShah of the project\u2014numbed<br />\nfrom the cold and in dire need of<br />\n<br />\na hot beverage herself, \"We all<br />\nhave fun doing it. it's definitely<br />\nworth the trouble even though the<br />\nrest of the campus thinks we're<br />\ncrazy.\"<br />\nAnother project initially attempted on a one-time basis but<br />\nwhich has since evolved into a<br />\nweekly event is volunteering at<br />\nManna House, a soup kitchen<br />\nlocated on North Avenue. Every<br />\nFriday, Saturday, and Sunday,<br />\nHopkins Circle K sends 4-6<br />\nmembers to assist with the serving of meals to the underprivileged. Despite the necessity of having to wake up at 7:30<br />\nam to make some of the early<br />\nshifts, this project is very wellattended. Dosia Paclawskyj explains her frequent involvement<br />\nin soup kitchens in the following<br />\nterms: \"It's easy to be sheltered<br />\nhere at JHU, especially when you<br />\nlive on campus. Working at soup<br />\nkitchens gives you a chance to see<br />\npeople from other walks of life.<br />\nYou get the opportunity to see<br />\nhow people deal with very difficult situations in life.\"<br />\nThe club participated in many<br />\nother events last semester.<br />\nMembers like Rani Kesavulu and<br />\nDewey Li helped raise close to<br />\n$450 for the Fuel Fund\u2014a<br />\nBaltimore non-profit group that<br />\nprovides winter heating for the<br />\ndisadvantaged\u2014by competing in<br />\na paddle boat race on the Harbor<br />\nrequiring teams of two to collect<br />\nas many floating balloons as<br />\npossible in a 15-minute time<br />\n<br />\nKiwanis on Campus<br />\nperiod.

A handful of studentwritten plays are chosen, casted<br />\nwith students, and directed by the<br />\naward-winning playwright. The<br />\nproduction is an opportunity to<br />\nview the state of theater at<br />\nHopkins. Judging by the performances of Jan. 30 and 31, two<br />\nthings are visible: students are<br />\nwatching too much television and<br />\nnot enough theater, and Edward<br />\nAlbee puts little faith in his<br />\naudience.<br />\nThe first play, for example,<br />\nwas a very light comedy by Mark<br />\nStewart called Slow Learner.<br />\nSimon (Herman Ayayo) has sexual encounters with three women:<br />\nVictoria, a prissy romantic played<br />\na la Lucille Ball by Jennifer Varrell; Odessa, a sexually-talented<br />\nice goddess (Peni Erlanger) who<br />\nspouts pseudo-Freudian explanations of Simon's behavior; and<br />\nJackie (Ilene Rosenzweig), the<br />\n\"hooker with a heart of gold\"<br />\nand probably a Bloomingdale's<br />\ncharge account. Slow Learner<br />\ntakes an adolescent view of sex,<br />\nand the jokes are on par with the<br />\nmost predictable of sit-corns.

The<br />\nBlack Sheep is a rambling farce<br />\nby Ted Egan about an engineering student who wants to score<br />\nwith women. Egan mixes old<br />\nWoody Allen movies with ABC<br />\nAfterschool Specials and comes<br />\nup with the story of Benny<br />\nVladavlusky (Gerry Guest), who<br />\nis set up with Vanessa Arbunkle<br />\n(Amy Reiter) by his friend<br />\nWayne Studley (Pietro Piccinini).<br />\nBenny has a terrible way with<br />\n<br />\nwomen: he mumbles to a drunken'<br />\npick-up, \"I just met you\u2014how<br />\nam I supposed to know where<br />\nyour damn genitals are!\" Benny<br />\ncalls Vanessa using phone notes<br />\n(a funny device out of<br />\nDoonesbury) and they date, and<br />\nwhen nothing big happens Benny<br />\nlies to Wayne about having sex<br />\nwith Vanessa. On hearing this,<br />\nWayne perks up and says, \"Gee,<br />\nI was all wrong about<br />\nVanessa . . .\" At this point the<br />\nplay should pause for a commercial for Ho-ho's, but it goes on<br />\nand at the end Benny winds up<br />\nwith Vanessa's friend Rhonda<br />\n(Kathy Kennedy), who up until<br />\nnow had been a peripheral<br />\ncharacter.<br />\nIf it sounds muddled, it is. How<br />\nAlbee the ground-breaking<br />\nplaywright chose this bit of sitcom fairjitale is a mystery.<br />\nEverything leads to a punchline<br />\nwhich is signalled five minutes<br />\nbeforehand. The performances,<br />\nthough, are good: Amy Reiter is<br />\na charming humanities major;<br />\nPiccinini is frighteningly convincing as a shallow, egotistical<br />\nboor; Chat Ewing makes a funny<br />\ncameo appearance as Ralph, the<br />\nsurreal bartender; and Kennedy<br />\n<br />\nleaves you wanting to see her<br />\nmore. But ultimately this is Gerry<br />\nGuest's play, and he carries the<br />\nwhole affair off with dignity,<br />\ncomedy, and appropriate nerdiness. The play is fascinating<br />\nbecause, despite the unbearably<br />\nworn topic and mess of a structure, The Black Sheep has some<br />\nbasic, undeniable charm. Maybe<br />\nit's the corny jokes, or the sit-com<br />\ndelivery of lines, or the absurd<br />\ndigressions (\"I'll never wear<br />\nwool again.\" \"If I had a dime for<br />\nevery time I'd said that,<br />\nkid . . .\").

Carse, The Free<br />\nPress, $13.95, 149 pp.<br />\nIf you were to try to step back<br />\nfrom the world and objectively<br />\nspeculate about mankind, it might<br />\nbe convenient to categorize people. Certainly you would make<br />\nsome generalizations which<br />\nwould require typing (or<br />\nstereotyping) individuals to capture human nature. If you sought<br />\nto suggest how to achieve a \"better\" world, you might contrast<br />\nyour depiction of humanity with<br />\na \"better\" person. This individual may or may not exist in<br />\ntoday's world. It may be<br />\naltogether possible that this person already exists within each of<br />\nus; he is, however, hidden, or<br />\nsuppressed.<br />\nGiven this intention, it would<br />\nbe difficult to do a more comprehensive job than James P.<br />\nCarse in his Finite and Infinite<br />\nGames. Carse indeed sets up a<br />\ncontrast between the players of<br />\nfinite games and infinite games.<br />\nThrough this contrast he can<br />\ntheorize on the human condition<br />\nand its manifestations in today's<br />\nworld.<br />\n\"Games\" is a playful<br />\nterm for manners of living.<br />\nCarse's \"games\" metaphor is effective because he can correlate<br />\nhis observations of board games<br />\nand athletic competitions, which<br />\ndescribe aspects of a finite game,<br />\nwith \"real life' (although we attempt to distinguish the two).<br />\nThe finite game is one of conquest, of power. Its players are<br />\ndesirous of trophies which attest<br />\nto their strength, thereby securing their position amongst others<br />\nin society. The finite game ends<br />\nwith a victor and a loser. Whereas<br />\nthe victor is duly memorialized,<br />\nthe loser is just as duly forgotten.<br />\nAs evident as the flaws are with<br />\nthis style of living--perhaps the<br />\ntwo greatest are the lack of interaction among people and the<br />\ngreat stifling of the human mind's<br />\ncreative genius--Carse's most interesting point is the contradictory<br />\n<br />\nlife of the finite player. The finite<br />\nplayer lives to end the game with<br />\nhis own conquest. It is played so<br />\nthat the conquest will be<br />\nremembered\u2014it is a game of the<br />\npast. In sum the finite game is<br />\nplayed to end itself. Further, by<br />\nseeking trophies and titles, the<br />\nfinite player hopes to secure a<br />\ndegree of immortality. As Carse<br />\ndescribes, this search is a<br />\nsupreme example of the contradictoriness of finite play. It<br />\nmeans living life in order to<br />\nsecure \"a life one cannot live.\"<br />\nBy contrast the infinite game is<br />\none in which the players do not<br />\ncompete against each other, but<br />\nrather interact with each other. It<br />\nis not a game in which there is a<br />\nwinner and loser, nor is it a game<br />\nwhich ends and which would,<br />\ntherefore, be remembered as a<br />\nthing of the past. The infinite<br />\ngame opens up the future, opening up new possibilities by bringing together individuals.<br />\nUsing this framework, Carse<br />\ndescribes many aspects of society: our sexuality, creativity,<br />\nmachinery, language. I appreciated this attention to the<br />\ndetails of our culture, though he<br />\ndoesn't move too much beyond<br />\nhis general point, which is made<br />\nearly on in the book.<br />\nAnother problem is one which<br />\nI feel is almost inevitable in the<br />\nsort of \"bettering the world\"<br />\nbook that this is: practicalities.<br />\nHonest communication is always<br />\ndesirable, as well as is a less<br />\ncompetitive world, and yet one<br />\nhas to ask where this restructuring of the world begins and what<br />\nthe individual can and should do.<br />\nHowever, it is not fair to the<br />\nbook to look at it purely from a<br />\npractical perspective. This is not<br />\nsimply a \"let's be better people\"<br />\nwork. It is a well-thought out<br />\ndiscourse which does particularly well when it tries to be a little<br />\nclever. The broad theme of the<br />\nfinite vs. infinite games is well<br />\nconstructed, albeit not completely original. In addition, Carse's<br />\ndiscussion of myths vs. history is<br />\nvery interesting. History suffers<br />\nthe same limitations as does the<br />\nfinite game. Historical periods<br />\n<br />\n'Atia2140444.44\".<br />\n<br />\nare treated as packages, Carse<br />\ndescribes, which may recur, but<br />\nat least have completed<br />\nthemselves. Myths, on the other<br />\nhand, are timeless and are such<br />\nthat they relate to individuals, as<br />\ndo individuals relate to the myths<br />\n(This interaction is crucial to the<br />\ninfinite game). Myths are even<br />\nauthorless, further expressing<br />\n<br />\ntheir relationship with all humanity, past and present. History, according to Carse, in its description of and explanation for past<br />\nevents gives only the finite interpretation and in fact is not truly<br />\ninsightful into human nature.<br />\nFinite and Infinite Games is not<br />\nunsatisfying reading, which I<br />\nthink is a compliment considering<br />\n<br />\nthere can be no solid resolution<br />\nin such broad material, which<br />\ncalls for a reshaping of our<br />\nvalues. Carse can be very clever<br />\nand even when he is not, he<br />\ndiscusses elements of ourselves<br />\nand society which bear some<br />\nthought.<br />\n<br />\nFirst History of the Woman Lawyer in America<br />\nby Don Holloway<br />\nThe Invisible Bar: The Woman<br />\nLawyer in America<br />\nKaren Berger Morello<br />\nRandom House, Inc.<br />\n271 pp., $19.95<br />\nAre men and women equal?<br />\nMore specifically, do men and<br />\nwomen have equal intellectual<br />\ncapabilities? In 1873, the<br />\nSupreme Court in its landmark<br />\ndecision of Bradwell v. the State<br />\nofIllinois came to the conclusion<br />\nthat men and women were \"intellectually separate.\" Based on<br />\nthe woman's \"natural timidity<br />\nand delicacy\" she was unfit for<br />\n<br />\nmany types of work, most notably<br />\nthe practice of law. Karen Berger<br />\nMorello's Invisible Bar: The<br />\nWoman Lawyer in America intelligently discusses the barriers<br />\nand accomplishments women<br />\nhave had in trying to gain access<br />\nto the obstinate sphere of law.<br />\nMorello traces the role women<br />\nhave had in reforming the legal<br />\nprofession and even in shaping<br />\nthe legal system.<br />\nHerself a lawyer and historian,<br />\nMorello documents and explains<br />\nthe impact of women's legal firsts<br />\nsuch as the first woman lawyer in<br />\nthe New World, the first black<br />\nwomen lawyers, the suffrage<br />\nmovement's effect on the drive to<br />\n<br />\nallow women in the bar, the first<br />\nwomen in law schools, and eventually the first woman to become<br />\na Supreme Court Justice. In an<br />\nunprecedented work, Morello<br />\nnotes that the first woman lawyer<br />\nin America, \"Gentleman<br />\nMargaret Brent,\" a barrister who<br />\narrived in Maryland in 1615 and<br />\nalso cousin to Lord Baltimore,<br />\nwas the only woman lawyer in<br />\nthe New World until 1869. The<br />\nreal struggle for women to enter<br />\nthe legal profession was an<br />\noutgrowth of the suffrage movement. An early leader of the suffrage movement, Myra Bradwell,<br />\nwas the first person to challenge<br />\na legal bar's admission standards.<br />\n<br />\nAfter completing all the requirements for admission except<br />\nformal application, Bradwell petitioned the Chicago Bar for entrance. She was refused. She<br />\nbrought the rejection to trial; and<br />\nthe case went to the Supreme<br />\nCourt, which delivered a questionable decision that the bar<br />\ncould reject an application on the<br />\ngrounds of sex.<br />\nThe finality of the ruling on<br />\nBradwell prompted a brief outcry<br />\nfrom America's left, but many in<br />\nthe mainstream felt that women<br />\nshould stay out of the legal profession. Popular ideas such as:<br />\n\"Women in the courtroom would<br />\nsway the opinions of jurists only<br />\n<br />\nwith a glance,\" \"Women in law<br />\nschools would distract young men<br />\nfrom lectures and work,\" \"Only unattractive, unmarried women<br />\nshould be allowed to have a<br />\ncareer in the law,\" all gave rise<br />\nto the notion that women in<br />\ngeneral should not be lawyers.<br />\nDespite the Court's decision,<br />\nwomen gradually trickled into<br />\nlaw firms and law schools, only<br />\nto be met with more barriers. For<br />\nexample, deans of most urban law<br />\nschools told women law students<br />\nthat after they graduated, they<br />\nwould be able to find the best<br />\nsecretarial positions in top law<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Ignored Accomplishments in the Bar<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\nfirms if they learned how to type.<br />\nIt was not until 1950 that women<br />\nhad entered every law school in<br />\nthe United States, with Harvard<br />\nLaw School giving way with a<br />\nthen large admission of ten<br />\nwomen in one class. Finally the<br />\ndoors to equal education had been<br />\nsomewhat opened, but Morello<br />\npoints out that the struggle is as<br />\ngreat today as it was a century<br />\nago. The title of the book itself,<br />\nThe Invisible Bar, refers to both<br />\nwomen's ignored accomplishments in the law and also the<br />\npast and present barriers that have<br />\nkept women from obtaining true<br />\nequality within the legal<br />\nprofession.<br />\nPerhaps the most shocking<br />\npoint Morello shows is how rare<br />\nwomen still are in the legal profession. As late as the seventies,<br />\nMorello found herself the only<br />\nwoman lawyer in the courtroom.<br />\n\"On several occasions I<br />\n[Morello] was told to sit down<br />\nand wait for my lawyer to show<br />\nup. Once, when I approached the<br />\nbench for a pretrial conference,<br />\nthe presiding judge refused to<br />\nbelieve I was a lawyer. A crowded and noisy courtroom fell silent<br />\nas he demanded to know the date<br />\nand place of my admission to the<br />\nbar. When I gave the information<br />\nthe judge winked at me and said,<br />\n'Okay, I'm sorry, honey,' then he<br />\nand spectators exploded with<br />\nlaughter.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Invisible Bar is the first<br />\ncomprehensive history of the<br />\nwoman lawyer in America.<br />\nPrimarily a critique of society and<br />\nits relation with the law,<br />\nMorello's work parallels the<br />\nrapid growth of liberalism in<br />\nsociety over the past century with<br />\nthe slow expansion of liberalism<br />\ninside the legal profession. Law,<br />\nitself designed to be conservative,<br />\nchanges only when forced out of<br />\nnecessity. When pressured long<br />\nenough, Morello notes, the<br />\nsystem evolves toward a more<br />\negalitarian framework. That<br />\nevolution is still incomplete.<br />\nThe importance of the subject<br />\nalone, of equal access to practicing law, is enough to keep the<br />\n\u2022reader's interest in The Invisible<br />\nBar. But Morello interjects anecdotes and psychological insights,<br />\nmaking the book a highly entertaining historical work. For example, Florynce Kennedy, one of<br />\nColumbia Law School's first<br />\nblack<br />\nwomen<br />\nstudents,<br />\nremembers after graduating in<br />\n1951 how \"law school made me<br />\nsee clearly for the first time how<br />\nthe law was used to maintain the<br />\nbullshit rather than to change<br />\nthings, and that justice was really a crock of shit.\" By the end of<br />\nthe book, the reader is left with<br />\none conclusion: Women have<br />\ncome a long way in entering the<br />\nlegal profession, but they have an<br />\neven longer struggle left ahead in<br />\norder to achieve real equality with<br />\ntheir male counterparts.<br />\n<br />\nTHE WOMAN LAWYER<br />\nIN AMERICA:11 R.77 N<br />\n1638 TO THE<br />\nPRESENT<br />\nLr<br />\n<br />\n:***********************<br />\n* VALENTINE'S WEEKEND<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/ ....... /<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n.0\"<br />\n<br />\nJhe p.m Rand p\u201e,enti _9t,<br />\n<br />\n* FRIDAY, FEB. 13: SEMI-FORMAL*<br />\n* at the Inner Harbor MARRIOTT<br />\n* featuring: the KLASSIX<br />\n* 9 pm \u2014 2 am Free Shuttle, Refreshments<br />\n$5 couple, $3 single at Union Desk & Res.<br />\n7` Life<br />\n41( sponsored by: Sophomore, Junior & Senior Classes:<br />\n<br />\n62n1 Annual<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\njhirci RehearJal<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\nSUNDAY FEB. 15: VALENTINE'S BASH*<br />\n<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\nwith RICHARD TAYLOR & THE RAVERS<br />\nat the Glass Pavilion (open to all)<br />\nadmission $2.00<br />\n10 pm \u2014 1 am<br />\nFree Refreshments, Door Prizes<br />\nsponsored by Freshman Class & Dorm Council<br />\n<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\n\u202200<br />\n6<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nPin<br />\n<br />\nROJC &Any<br />\n* Don't Forget \u2014 Pat Metheny in concert Sunday,<br />\nFeb. 15 in Shriver And. at 7:30 pm<br />\n<br />\nSt<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nWehincl _Athletic Center/<br />\nWe/'come<br />\neveryone<br />\n<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\nSt<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\n\f18/FEBRUARY 6, 1987<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\nCaffeine: A Student's Saving Grace or Downfall?<br />\nby Robert Smariga<br />\nYou've got a long night ahead<br />\nof you.

The Blue Jays,<br />\nwhose tallest man is barely above<br />\nsix feet tall, were giving the<br />\nNaval Academy's JV all they<br />\ncould handle. After five minutes<br />\nwere gone in the first half, Coach<br />\nWeb Johnson seriously considered calling a timeout so that<br />\nhis team could just look at the<br />\nscoreboard and savor the moment. Hopkins was not only staying close to a Division I school,<br />\nthey were actually holding a<br />\n16-14 lead.<br />\nHopkins came out on fire, using a slow-down offense to keep<br />\nthe ball away from the explosive<br />\nNavy offense. After using almost<br />\nall of the 45-second clock, the<br />\nBlue Jays were getting key<br />\nbuckets from Greg Bronshvag<br />\nand three-pointers from Steve<br />\nBlumenthal. Freshman Tim<br />\nCoyle got some key rebounds,<br />\ndespite being about five inches<br />\nshorter than the Middies' rebounders. If the Jays kept up their<br />\n<br />\nearly pace, Coach Johnson probably would have been offered a<br />\nlucrative contract to coach the<br />\nNew York Knicks.<br />\nWell, as you've probably<br />\nguessed, the Naval Academy<br />\nfinally disposed of the pesky Blue<br />\nJays and coasted to a 78-35 victory. In the end, the Middies were<br />\njust too much for Hopkins to handle, despite some gutsy defense<br />\nby Mike Stern and Stefano<br />\nAgolini,. Blumenthal led all<br />\nHopkins scorers with 19 points,<br />\nfollowed by Greg Bronshvag with<br />\n8, Pat Furey and Tim Coyle with<br />\n3 apiece, and \"Sheep\" Tarver<br />\nwith 2.

Yes or no.<br />\nIs commercialization of<br />\nundergraduates for revenue acceptable? Yes or no.<br />\nShould coaches, after a threeyear probationary period, receive<br />\nfaculty tenure? Yes or no.<br />\nShould the student body be<br />\nallowed representative seating at<br />\n<br />\nincome-producing sporting<br />\nevents? Yes or no.<br />\nAnd finally, would you explain<br />\nto your coaches what a<br />\n\"representative season\" is, in<br />\nrelation to wins and losses? Yes<br />\nor no.<br />\nI'm going to say it once again:<br />\nThe people who should answer<br />\nfor these problems are not the<br />\nguys at the NCAA, because they<br />\nwork at the pleasure of the<br />\npresidents of the universities. The<br />\npresidents should decide the<br />\npolicies, instead of hiding behind<br />\ncommittees or boards that never<br />\nsay anything, that dance in the<br />\nshadows until the band goes<br />\nhome.<br />\nHey guys, come out from<br />\nbehind your desks. You're the<br />\nonly person in the stable. It<br />\ndoesn't make any difference what<br />\nthe jockey says, what the trainer<br />\nsays, what the groom says, or<br />\neven what the horse says. You<br />\nown the stable. You should set the<br />\nrules. You have the authority to<br />\nput responsibility in the proper<br />\narea of your athletic departments.<br />\nFor example: If we claim that<br />\nwe have the best faculties in the<br />\nworld at our universities, then<br />\nwhy is it so difficult to educate a<br />\nperson who gets a 650, rather<br />\nthan a 700, on his SAT's? If it's<br />\nthat difficult, then I think we'd<br />\nbetter start checking on the ability of our faculty. Or are we there<br />\nto educate, or just to educate the<br />\neducated?<br />\nTo sum up, I'd say, college<br />\npresidents, make decisions. Make<br />\n'em, even if they are unpopular.<br />\nIt's time for hardball, or college<br />\nsports is going to lose its<br />\ncredibility throughout the country. Right now, there's a<br />\ncredibility gap in discipline, in the<br />\nacademic end, and perhaps most<br />\nimportantly, on the moral side of<br />\nthings.<br />\nSo far, you've been content to<br />\nput the spotlight on the wrong<br />\npeople\u2014the athletic departments,<br />\nthe coaches, the student athletes.<br />\nThey're not in charge. And yet,<br />\nyou'd want everybody to believe<br />\nit's them who have egg on their<br />\ntie.<br />\nJump in the water. Find out<br />\nwhat the real world is like. I<br />\nknow you like to picture yourself<br />\nas Gregory Peck going after the<br />\nGreat White Whale, but there's<br />\nmore to it than showing up at the<br />\nparking lot in your best tweed<br />\nsport coat for the tailgate on<br />\nSaturdays.<br />\nCome on, you presidents.<br />\nCome out and say what you want.<br />\nThe NCAA answers to you. If<br />\nyou guys have the courage to say<br />\nit shouldn't be, then it won't be.<br />\nBut it's time, on the abovementioned questions, for you to<br />\ntake charge of your own destiny<br />\ninside the jock world.

Now is your chance to party hearty and get to know all those great, lovable people in Hopkins' Greek Society. Some pretty familiar<br />\n<br />\nnames were members of fraternities that have chapters here at Hopkins, and this week's quiz asks you to match these names to their appropriate frat. Here is a little advice: go to the different houses and ask<br />\n:4 the brothers and sisters for some help. Whatever you do, have fun. There are some frats that do not have chapters here, but I guess it wouldn't be a good quiz if I didn't try to stump you. Now get out there<br />\n'<br />\n4 and rush, rush, russsssh. Get your entries to the News-Letter Acropolis (jadis, le Chalet, ne Gatehouse) by Wednesday the eleventh at seventeen bells. See you on the radio.<br />\n<br />\nResults: Talk about entries... One Geek sent me a seven page computer printout to solve the problem. Too bad he was wrong. And confusing. Its a shame I don't give points for stumping the ole QM.<br />\nOr extra credit. This week's winner is Sandra Merrick for being persistent (and cute, too). The answer was supposed to be 4!, but that assumes a nautical mile to be 6000 ft. A guy from the Coast Guard<br />\n,14 told me that value, but since then I've seen values ranging from 6076-6080 ft. I guess it is true, never trust a sailor on leave. Anyhow the answers were A)-1, B)6000, C)283200. D) 10200, E) 28, F) 3215,<br />\nG) 1024, H) 3, I) 88.1, J) 3.1, K) 7, L) 7, M) Don't ask, N) 2, 0)4.95, P) 1.35, Q) 4, R) 6, S) 20, 1) 6, U) 8, V) 2, W)2, X) 1, Y) 1, Z) 4! or something between 1919.2! and 2020!. If you want to<br />\n:4<br />\nknow the values that is your business, I never asked you to solve once you found Z.

But he may well<br />\nhave opened the Administration to much<br />\nmore criticism than he ever expected in<br />\nthose turbulent days last semester.<br />\nThis week, the Committee on Freedom<br />\nof Expression, chaired by Richard<br />\nFlathman of the department of political<br />\nscience, released the first draft of its report<br />\nwhich harshly criticizes the University for<br />\nits \"aberrant action\" in the arrest of shantybuilders and demolition of a protest shanty. The report also proposes a Statement<br />\nof Principle and Practice that goes far<br />\nbeyond present University policy in defending and \"fostering\" freedom of<br />\nexpression.<br />\nIn both its substance and language, the<br />\nreport is undoubtedly one of the most<br />\ncourageous documents to emerge from the<br />\nUniversity in recent memory and is a credit<br />\nto the University and the committee that<br />\nproduced it.<br />\nIn forming the report (printed in its entirety elsewhere on these pages) the Committee on Freedom of Expression made a<br />\nsharp departure form the traditional University line at a number of points.<br />\nFirst, the report insists that the University must protect and foster all forms of expression \"so long as neither physical injury to persons nor significant damage to<br />\nproperty is inflicted.\" Until now, University officials have argued that potential<br />\nthreats to personal safety (like fires and<br />\nshanty-attacks) outweigh rights to freedom<br />\nof expression. The report seems to have<br />\ntaken the contrary position.<br />\nFurthermore, the report stresses the<br />\nresponsibility of the University to \"make<br />\nspecial efforts\" to accomodate expression<br />\nof ideas particularly when those ideas are<br />\nrepugnant to some members of the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nBeyond its nearly unconditional defense<br />\nof freedom of expression, the report of the<br /><br />\nCommittee also calls for a rather sweeping procedural change in dealing with<br />\nfreedom of expression issues.<br />\nDuring last semester's confrontations, the<br />\nExecutive Committee of the Board of<br />\nTrustees took the lead in setting University policy with regard to freedom of speech<br />\nissues. It was the Executive Committee, for<br />\nexample, that \"outlawed\" the construction<br />\nof shanties in a curt policy statement in the<br />\nGazette. Later, the Executive Committee<br />\nreversed its shanty-ban in a late-night<br />\nmeeting after the arrest of fourteen<br />\nprotestors.<br />\nThe Committee on Freedom of Expression, however, recommends that the<br />\nauthority to deal with freedom of speech<br />\nissues be vested not in the Executive Committee, but rather in the Academic Council.<br />\nSpecifically, the Committee urges the<br />\nAcademic Council to form an \"Ad Hoc Committee of faculty and students\" when difficulty arises \"in the implementation of the<br />\nprinciple of freedom of expression.\"<br />\nThe procedural change recommended by<br />\nthe Committee on Freedom of Expression<br />\nis an important one. If enacted, it would<br />\ntake the authority to deal with problems of<br />\nfreedom of expression out of the hands of<br />\na committee which has traditionally been<br />\nsomewhat aloof(and rightly so) from the<br />\nday to day happenings on campus, and<br />\nplace that authority in a much more accessible body.<br />\nFurthermore, the procedure recommended by the Committee on Freedom of Expression would allow, for once, real opportunities for student input into the resolution<br />\nof problems relating to freedom of<br />\nexpression.<br />\nOn the whole, the Statement of Principle and Practice outlined in the Committee's report merits prompt consideration.<br />\nLike the Committee on Freedom of Expression, we urge the Academic Council, President and Board of Trustees to adopt the<br />\nStatement of Principle and Practice formally as a policy of the University. And, we<br />\ncongratulate the Committee on Freedom of<br />\nExpression for a job well done.<br /><br />\nImage-Polishing<br />\nIt's clear that this semester has gotten off<br />\nto a less dramatic start than last semester.<br />\nIn the absence of arrests, trials and protests,<br />\nthe new semester hardly seems thrilling.<br />\nNevertheless, important work is waiting to<br />\nbe done. It's time Council started worrying about it.<br />\nLast week, we urged Council to use the<br />\nrelative calm of the new semester to set a<br />\ndetailed agenda of priorities. We suggested<br />\nthat the SAC seals, social programming and<br />\nsecurity would be appropriate for such an<br />\nagenda. Undoubtedly, there are other issues<br />\nwhich merit attention like responding to the<br />\nconclusions of the Committee on Free Expression and redefining the role of the<br />\nCOC.<br />\nNevertheless, despite the range of work<br />\nwaiting to be done, Council used its most<br />\nrecent session not to address the work at<br />\nhand but to debate, of all things, its own<br /><br />\nimage in the media.<br />\nDuring an hour and a half long meeting,<br />\ndiscussion was devoted almost exclusively<br />\nto News-Letter coverage of Council's activities and to criticisms made on these<br />\npages last week. Council concluded that the<br />\nNews-Letter has created \"negative feelings\" and decided to investigate the<br />\npossibility of writing its own reports of SC<br />\nactivities\u2014presumably those reports will be<br />\nnicer.<br />\nWe hope that after its lengthy debate<br />\nCouncil has now exhausted its interest in<br />\nitself and its image and will turn to the more<br />\nserious and productive business of serving<br />\nits constituency. We look forward to<br />\ndebates of more worthy issues in weeks to<br />\ncome. Perhaps with a docket of such issues<br />\nscheduled for debate, Council won't have<br />\nto worry about attracting a quorum of its<br />\nmembers to its meetings.<br /><br />\nOn Free Expression<br />\nThe following is the first draft<br />\nofthe report ofthe Committee on<br />\nFreedom of Expression chaired<br />\nby Professor Richard Flathman of<br />\nthe Department of Political<br />\nScience.<br />\nThe committee was formed in<br />\nearly October shortly after the arrest offourteen shanty-builders.<br />\nAt the time, University President<br />\nSteven Muller charged the committee with the responsibility of<br />\ninvestigating freedom of speech<br />\nissues.<br />\nReport Of The Committee<br />\nOn Freedom of Expression<br />\nPreamble<br /><br />\nThe Committee's concept of its<br />\ntask is influenced by the circumstances, both immediate and<br />\nlonger term, in which it was convened. In September of 1986, the<br />\nUniversity obtained a court injunction forbidding the construction on campus of structures intended to serve as symbols of a<br />\npolitical movement. (The structures were called \"shanties\" and<br />\nwere the chosen symbol of a<br />\nmovement, widespread in the<br />\nUnited States and elsewhere, to<br />\ncombat the Apartheid system in<br />\nSouth Africa.) Participants in the<br />\nmovement refused to obey the injunction, erected and refused to<br />\nremove a structure, and were arrested. Large numbers of students<br />\nand faculty protested these actions<br />\nby the University, claiming that<br />\nthey constituted unwarranted interference with freedom of expression in the University community. These protests led to the<br />\nappointment of this Committee.<br />\nThese events and hence the task<br />\nof this Committee must be seen<br />\nin the larger perspective of the<br />\nhistory of the Homewood Cam-<br /><br />\npus of the Johns Hopkins University. In obtaining and requesting<br />\nthe enforcement of an injunction<br />\nagainst a non-violent form of<br />\npolitical expression, the University took an action that is unprecedented in its specific<br />\ncharacter and a sharp departure<br />\nfrom the traditional commmitment of this University community to the protection and encouragement of the widest possible freedom of expression. The<br />\nvigor of the reaction against the<br />\nUniversity's aberrant action is<br />\nevidence that those commitments<br />\nremain firm throughout much of<br />\nthe University community.<br />\nIn this perspective, the primary<br />\ntask of the Committee is forcefully to reaffirm commitments that<br />\nare already widely accepted; to<br />\narticulate anew understandings<br />\nthat are fundamental to a university and that are among our<br />\nproudest traditions. Freedom of<br />\nexpression has been attacked<br />\nfrom many directions. The only<br />\neffective protection for it, finally, is a community convinced of<br />\nits fundamental importance.<br />\nThe Committee recommends<br />\nformal adoption, by the<br />\nAcademic Council, President,<br />\nand Board of Trustees, of the<br />\nfollowing Statement of Principle<br />\nas a fundamental norm of the<br />\nUniversity. The Committee further recommends institutionalization, at the Homewood Campus,<br />\nof the understandings and procedures contained in the following Statement of Practice. The<br />\nCommittee further recommends<br />\nthat the Statement of Principle<br />\nand Practice be included in all<br />\nfuture editions of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Arts and Sciences/<br />\nEngineering Catalogue and the<br />\nContinued on Page 9<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nTimothy McNamara<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nAaron Davis, Flory Ware<br />\nElizabeth Harrigan<br />\nKathleen McCarthy,Jon Stempel<br />\nLaurah Limbrick, Sue Trowbridge<br />\nJay Lechtman<br />\nEly Brown, Joseph Gergyes<br />\nVandana Kumra<br />\nChristopher Szeles, Adam Warner<br />\nDiana Zeiger<br />\nJess Bunshaft, Ganesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\nEditor<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nFeatures Editor<br />\nScience Editor<br />\nBooks Editor<br />\nSports Editors<br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nPhoto Editors<br /><br />\nStaff Writers: Uri Ahn, L.

Is the routine of college<br />\nlife going to engulf you, along<br />\nwith the hordes of other<br />\nanonymous, apathetic individuals<br />\npopulating the campus? Take<br />\ntime out to do something rewarding and fun. For starters, check<br />\nout Johns Hopkins' Circle K<br />\nClub, which according to Jackie<br />\nMeister, \"combines leadership<br />\nand service with friendship and<br />\nfun.\" President Vandana Kumra<br />\nadds, \"It's the one club where<br />\nyou get the 'total college<br />\nexperience.\"<br />\nThe largest collegiate service<br />\norganization in the world, Circle<br />\nK involves itself in many activities, both on campus and in the<br />\ncommunity. With an already<br />\nsizeable membership of 40 and on<br />\nthe rise, the club abounds in fresh<br />\nideas, many of which are<br />\ndeveloped into full-fledged projects. While seemingly farfetched when jokingly proposed<br />\nat a meeting, Murat Akalin's<br />\nbrainstorm of a free hot chocolate<br />\ngiveaway on campus grew to be<br />\na bi-monthly occurrence. On Friday nights in the Freshman Quad,<br />\nyou may have come across a<br />\ngroup of fellow students braving<br />\nthe near-freezing temperatures to<br />\nproffer cups of steaming hot<br />\nchocolate at no cost. Says Swati<br />\nShah of the project\u2014numbed<br />\nfrom the cold and in dire need of<br /><br />\na hot beverage herself, \"We all<br />\nhave fun doing it. it's definitely<br />\nworth the trouble even though the<br />\nrest of the campus thinks we're<br />\ncrazy.\"<br />\nAnother project initially attempted on a one-time basis but<br />\nwhich has since evolved into a<br />\nweekly event is volunteering at<br />\nManna House, a soup kitchen<br />\nlocated on North Avenue. Every<br />\nFriday, Saturday, and Sunday,<br />\nHopkins Circle K sends 4-6<br />\nmembers to assist with the serving of meals to the underprivileged. Despite the necessity of having to wake up at 7:30<br />\nam to make some of the early<br />\nshifts, this project is very wellattended. Dosia Paclawskyj explains her frequent involvement<br />\nin soup kitchens in the following<br />\nterms: \"It's easy to be sheltered<br />\nhere at JHU, especially when you<br />\nlive on campus. Working at soup<br />\nkitchens gives you a chance to see<br />\npeople from other walks of life.<br />\nYou get the opportunity to see<br />\nhow people deal with very difficult situations in life.\"<br />\nThe club participated in many<br />\nother events last semester.<br />\nMembers like Rani Kesavulu and<br />\nDewey Li helped raise close to<br />\n$450 for the Fuel Fund\u2014a<br />\nBaltimore non-profit group that<br />\nprovides winter heating for the<br />\ndisadvantaged\u2014by competing in<br />\na paddle boat race on the Harbor<br />\nrequiring teams of two to collect<br />\nas many floating balloons as<br />\npossible in a 15-minute time<br /><br />\nKiwanis on Campus<br />\nperiod.

A handful of studentwritten plays are chosen, casted<br />\nwith students, and directed by the<br />\naward-winning playwright. The<br />\nproduction is an opportunity to<br />\nview the state of theater at<br />\nHopkins. Judging by the performances of Jan. 30 and 31, two<br />\nthings are visible: students are<br />\nwatching too much television and<br />\nnot enough theater, and Edward<br />\nAlbee puts little faith in his<br />\naudience.<br />\nThe first play, for example,<br />\nwas a very light comedy by Mark<br />\nStewart called Slow Learner.<br />\nSimon (Herman Ayayo) has sexual encounters with three women:<br />\nVictoria, a prissy romantic played<br />\na la Lucille Ball by Jennifer Varrell; Odessa, a sexually-talented<br />\nice goddess (Peni Erlanger) who<br />\nspouts pseudo-Freudian explanations of Simon's behavior; and<br />\nJackie (Ilene Rosenzweig), the<br />\n\"hooker with a heart of gold\"<br />\nand probably a Bloomingdale's<br />\ncharge account. Slow Learner<br />\ntakes an adolescent view of sex,<br />\nand the jokes are on par with the<br />\nmost predictable of sit-corns. The<br />\nfinal scene, the women in bed<br />\ntrading sexual insults, is almost<br />\noffensive.

Just as<br />\nany play about a suicidal Danish<br />\nprince is hampered by the fact<br />\nthat' Hamlet was written, Lae<br />\nmust be compared to the wonderful AIDS play, As Is. Though<br />\nwell-written, Keep Moving has<br />\ncomparatively nothing fresh to<br />\nsay about AIDS patients, and<br />\nAlbee's one \"drama\" of the night<br />\nends up as bland.<br />\nThe last play of the evening<br />\nwas, like an episode of The<br />\nCosby Show, an artificial, structurally weak crowd-pleaser. The<br />\nBlack Sheep is a rambling farce<br />\nby Ted Egan about an engineering student who wants to score<br />\nwith women. Egan mixes old<br />\nWoody Allen movies with ABC<br />\nAfterschool Specials and comes<br />\nup with the story of Benny<br />\nVladavlusky (Gerry Guest), who<br />\nis set up with Vanessa Arbunkle<br />\n(Amy Reiter) by his friend<br />\nWayne Studley (Pietro Piccinini).<br />\nBenny has a terrible way with<br /><br />\nwomen: he mumbles to a drunken'<br />\npick-up, \"I just met you\u2014how<br />\nam I supposed to know where<br />\nyour damn genitals are!\" Benny<br />\ncalls Vanessa using phone notes<br />\n(a funny device out of<br />\nDoonesbury) and they date, and<br />\nwhen nothing big happens Benny<br />\nlies to Wayne about having sex<br />\nwith Vanessa. On hearing this,<br />\nWayne perks up and says, \"Gee,<br />\nI was all wrong about<br />\nVanessa . . .\" At this point the<br />\nplay should pause for a commercial for Ho-ho's, but it goes on<br />\nand at the end Benny winds up<br />\nwith Vanessa's friend Rhonda<br />\n(Kathy Kennedy), who up until<br />\nnow had been a peripheral<br />\ncharacter.<br />\nIf it sounds muddled, it is. How<br />\nAlbee the ground-breaking<br />\nplaywright chose this bit of sitcom fairjitale is a mystery.<br />\nEverything leads to a punchline<br />\nwhich is signalled five minutes<br />\nbeforehand. The performances,<br />\nthough, are good: Amy Reiter is<br />\na charming humanities major;<br />\nPiccinini is frighteningly convincing as a shallow, egotistical<br />\nboor; Chat Ewing makes a funny<br />\ncameo appearance as Ralph, the<br />\nsurreal bartender; and Kennedy<br /><br />\nleaves you wanting to see her<br />\nmore. But ultimately this is Gerry<br />\nGuest's play, and he carries the<br />\nwhole affair off with dignity,<br />\ncomedy, and appropriate nerdiness. The play is fascinating<br />\nbecause, despite the unbearably<br />\nworn topic and mess of a structure, The Black Sheep has some<br />\nbasic, undeniable charm. Maybe<br />\nit's the corny jokes, or the sit-com<br />\ndelivery of lines, or the absurd<br />\ndigressions (\"I'll never wear<br />\nwool again.\" \"If I had a dime for<br />\nevery time I'd said that,<br />\nkid . . .\"). But, maybe, its charm<br />\nis like Benny's: its dignified,<br />\ncomic and appropriate nerdiness.<br />\nTwo last comments: One,<br />\nthough the performances mostly<br />\noutdid the plays, if playwrights<br />\nkeep away from TV and let loose<br />\na little more (like Naidine Adams<br />\ndid) there is hope.

Carse, The Free<br />\nPress, $13.95, 149 pp.<br />\nIf you were to try to step back<br />\nfrom the world and objectively<br />\nspeculate about mankind, it might<br />\nbe convenient to categorize people. Certainly you would make<br />\nsome generalizations which<br />\nwould require typing (or<br />\nstereotyping) individuals to capture human nature. If you sought<br />\nto suggest how to achieve a \"better\" world, you might contrast<br />\nyour depiction of humanity with<br />\na \"better\" person. This individual may or may not exist in<br />\ntoday's world. It may be<br />\naltogether possible that this person already exists within each of<br />\nus; he is, however, hidden, or<br />\nsuppressed.<br />\nGiven this intention, it would<br />\nbe difficult to do a more comprehensive job than James P.<br />\nCarse in his Finite and Infinite<br />\nGames. Carse indeed sets up a<br />\ncontrast between the players of<br />\nfinite games and infinite games.<br />\nThrough this contrast he can<br />\ntheorize on the human condition<br />\nand its manifestations in today's<br />\nworld.<br />\n\"Games\" is a playful<br />\nterm for manners of living.<br />\nCarse's \"games\" metaphor is effective because he can correlate<br />\nhis observations of board games<br />\nand athletic competitions, which<br />\ndescribe aspects of a finite game,<br />\nwith \"real life' (although we attempt to distinguish the two).<br />\nThe finite game is one of conquest, of power. Its players are<br />\ndesirous of trophies which attest<br />\nto their strength, thereby securing their position amongst others<br />\nin society. The finite game ends<br />\nwith a victor and a loser. Whereas<br />\nthe victor is duly memorialized,<br />\nthe loser is just as duly forgotten.<br />\nAs evident as the flaws are with<br />\nthis style of living--perhaps the<br />\ntwo greatest are the lack of interaction among people and the<br />\ngreat stifling of the human mind's<br />\ncreative genius--Carse's most interesting point is the contradictory<br /><br />\nlife of the finite player. The finite<br />\nplayer lives to end the game with<br />\nhis own conquest. It is played so<br />\nthat the conquest will be<br />\nremembered\u2014it is a game of the<br />\npast. In sum the finite game is<br />\nplayed to end itself. Further, by<br />\nseeking trophies and titles, the<br />\nfinite player hopes to secure a<br />\ndegree of immortality. As Carse<br />\ndescribes, this search is a<br />\nsupreme example of the contradictoriness of finite play. It<br />\nmeans living life in order to<br />\nsecure \"a life one cannot live.\"<br />\nBy contrast the infinite game is<br />\none in which the players do not<br />\ncompete against each other, but<br />\nrather interact with each other. It<br />\nis not a game in which there is a<br />\nwinner and loser, nor is it a game<br />\nwhich ends and which would,<br />\ntherefore, be remembered as a<br />\nthing of the past. The infinite<br />\ngame opens up the future, opening up new possibilities by bringing together individuals.<br />\nUsing this framework, Carse<br />\ndescribes many aspects of society: our sexuality, creativity,<br />\nmachinery, language. I appreciated this attention to the<br />\ndetails of our culture, though he<br />\ndoesn't move too much beyond<br />\nhis general point, which is made<br />\nearly on in the book.<br />\nAnother problem is one which<br />\nI feel is almost inevitable in the<br />\nsort of \"bettering the world\"<br />\nbook that this is: practicalities.<br />\nHonest communication is always<br />\ndesirable, as well as is a less<br />\ncompetitive world, and yet one<br />\nhas to ask where this restructuring of the world begins and what<br />\nthe individual can and should do.<br />\nHowever, it is not fair to the<br />\nbook to look at it purely from a<br />\npractical perspective. This is not<br />\nsimply a \"let's be better people\"<br />\nwork. It is a well-thought out<br />\ndiscourse which does particularly well when it tries to be a little<br />\nclever. The broad theme of the<br />\nfinite vs. infinite games is well<br />\nconstructed, albeit not completely original. In addition, Carse's<br />\ndiscussion of myths vs. history is<br />\nvery interesting. History suffers<br />\nthe same limitations as does the<br />\nfinite game.

In 1873, the<br />\nSupreme Court in its landmark<br />\ndecision of Bradwell v. the State<br />\nofIllinois came to the conclusion<br />\nthat men and women were \"intellectually separate.\" Based on<br />\nthe woman's \"natural timidity<br />\nand delicacy\" she was unfit for<br /><br />\nmany types of work, most notably<br />\nthe practice of law. Karen Berger<br />\nMorello's Invisible Bar: The<br />\nWoman Lawyer in America intelligently discusses the barriers<br />\nand accomplishments women<br />\nhave had in trying to gain access<br />\nto the obstinate sphere of law.<br />\nMorello traces the role women<br />\nhave had in reforming the legal<br />\nprofession and even in shaping<br />\nthe legal system.<br />\nHerself a lawyer and historian,<br />\nMorello documents and explains<br />\nthe impact of women's legal firsts<br />\nsuch as the first woman lawyer in<br />\nthe New World, the first black<br />\nwomen lawyers, the suffrage<br />\nmovement's effect on the drive to<br /><br />\nallow women in the bar, the first<br />\nwomen in law schools, and eventually the first woman to become<br />\na Supreme Court Justice. In an<br />\nunprecedented work, Morello<br />\nnotes that the first woman lawyer<br />\nin America, \"Gentleman<br />\nMargaret Brent,\" a barrister who<br />\narrived in Maryland in 1615 and<br />\nalso cousin to Lord Baltimore,<br />\nwas the only woman lawyer in<br />\nthe New World until 1869. The<br />\nreal struggle for women to enter<br />\nthe legal profession was an<br />\noutgrowth of the suffrage movement. An early leader of the suffrage movement, Myra Bradwell,<br />\nwas the first person to challenge<br />\na legal bar's admission standards.<br /><br />\nAfter completing all the requirements for admission except<br />\nformal application, Bradwell petitioned the Chicago Bar for entrance. She was refused. She<br />\nbrought the rejection to trial; and<br />\nthe case went to the Supreme<br />\nCourt, which delivered a questionable decision that the bar<br />\ncould reject an application on the<br />\ngrounds of sex.<br />\nThe finality of the ruling on<br />\nBradwell prompted a brief outcry<br />\nfrom America's left, but many in<br />\nthe mainstream felt that women<br />\nshould stay out of the legal profession. Popular ideas such as:<br />\n\"Women in the courtroom would<br />\nsway the opinions of jurists only<br /><br />\nwith a glance,\" \"Women in law<br />\nschools would distract young men<br />\nfrom lectures and work,\" \"Only unattractive, unmarried women<br />\nshould be allowed to have a<br />\ncareer in the law,\" all gave rise<br />\nto the notion that women in<br />\ngeneral should not be lawyers.<br />\nDespite the Court's decision,<br />\nwomen gradually trickled into<br />\nlaw firms and law schools, only<br />\nto be met with more barriers. For<br />\nexample, deans of most urban law<br />\nschools told women law students<br />\nthat after they graduated, they<br />\nwould be able to find the best<br />\nsecretarial positions in top law<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br /><br />\nWomen's Ignored Accomplishments in the Bar<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\nfirms if they learned how to type.<br />\nIt was not until 1950 that women<br />\nhad entered every law school in<br />\nthe United States, with Harvard<br />\nLaw School giving way with a<br />\nthen large admission of ten<br />\nwomen in one class. Finally the<br />\ndoors to equal education had been<br />\nsomewhat opened, but Morello<br />\npoints out that the struggle is as<br />\ngreat today as it was a century<br />\nago. The title of the book itself,<br />\nThe Invisible Bar, refers to both<br />\nwomen's ignored accomplishments in the law and also the<br />\npast and present barriers that have<br />\nkept women from obtaining true<br />\nequality within the legal<br />\nprofession.<br />\nPerhaps the most shocking<br />\npoint Morello shows is how rare<br />\nwomen still are in the legal profession. As late as the seventies,<br />\nMorello found herself the only<br />\nwoman lawyer in the courtroom.<br />\n\"On several occasions I<br />\n[Morello] was told to sit down<br />\nand wait for my lawyer to show<br />\nup. Once, when I approached the<br />\nbench for a pretrial conference,<br />\nthe presiding judge refused to<br />\nbelieve I was a lawyer. A crowded and noisy courtroom fell silent<br />\nas he demanded to know the date<br />\nand place of my admission to the<br />\nbar. When I gave the information<br />\nthe judge winked at me and said,<br />\n'Okay, I'm sorry, honey,' then he<br />\nand spectators exploded with<br />\nlaughter.\"<br /><br />\nThe Invisible Bar is the first<br />\ncomprehensive history of the<br />\nwoman lawyer in America.<br />\nPrimarily a critique of society and<br />\nits relation with the law,<br />\nMorello's work parallels the<br />\nrapid growth of liberalism in<br />\nsociety over the past century with<br />\nthe slow expansion of liberalism<br />\ninside the legal profession. Law,<br />\nitself designed to be conservative,<br />\nchanges only when forced out of<br />\nnecessity. When pressured long<br />\nenough, Morello notes, the<br />\nsystem evolves toward a more<br />\negalitarian framework. That<br />\nevolution is still incomplete.<br />\nThe importance of the subject<br />\nalone, of equal access to practicing law, is enough to keep the<br />\n\u2022reader's interest in The Invisible<br />\nBar. But Morello interjects anecdotes and psychological insights,<br />\nmaking the book a highly entertaining historical work. For example, Florynce Kennedy, one of<br />\nColumbia Law School's first<br />\nblack<br />\nwomen<br />\nstudents,<br />\nremembers after graduating in<br />\n1951 how \"law school made me<br />\nsee clearly for the first time how<br />\nthe law was used to maintain the<br />\nbullshit rather than to change<br />\nthings, and that justice was really a crock of shit.\" By the end of<br />\nthe book, the reader is left with<br />\none conclusion: Women have<br />\ncome a long way in entering the<br />\nlegal profession, but they have an<br />\neven longer struggle left ahead in<br />\norder to achieve real equality with<br />\ntheir male counterparts.<br /><br />\nTHE WOMAN LAWYER<br />\nIN AMERICA:11 R.77 N<br />\n1638 TO THE<br />\nPRESENT<br />\nLr<br /><br />\n:***********************<br />\n* VALENTINE'S WEEKEND<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/ ....... /<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n.0\"<br /><br />\nJhe p.m Rand p\u201e,enti _9t,<br /><br />\n* FRIDAY, FEB. 13: SEMI-FORMAL*<br />\n* at the Inner Harbor MARRIOTT<br />\n* featuring: the KLASSIX<br />\n* 9 pm \u2014 2 am Free Shuttle, Refreshments<br />\n$5 couple, $3 single at Union Desk &amp; Res.<br />\n7` Life<br />\n41( sponsored by: Sophomore, Junior &amp; Senior Classes:<br /><br />\n62n1 Annual<br />\nS.<br /><br />\njhirci RehearJal<br />\nSt<br /><br />\nSUNDAY FEB. 15: VALENTINE'S BASH*<br /><br />\nS.<br /><br />\nS.<br /><br />\nSt<br /><br />\nwith RICHARD TAYLOR &amp; THE RAVERS<br />\nat the Glass Pavilion (open to all)<br />\nadmission $2.00<br />\n10 pm \u2014 1 am<br />\nFree Refreshments, Door Prizes<br />\nsponsored by Freshman Class &amp; Dorm Council<br /><br />\nSt<br /><br />\nSt<br /><br />\nS.<br /><br />\nSt<br /><br />\n\u202200<br />\n6<br />\n'<br /><br />\nPin<br /><br />\nROJC &amp;Any<br />\n* Don't Forget \u2014 Pat Metheny in concert Sunday,<br />\nFeb. 15 in Shriver And. at 7:30 pm<br /><br />\nSt<br />\nSt<br /><br />\n,<br />\nWehincl _Athletic Center/<br />\nWe/'come<br />\neveryone<br /><br />\nS.<br /><br />\nSt<br />\nS.<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\nS.<br /><br />\n18/FEBRUARY 6, 1987<br /><br />\nScience<br />\nCaffeine: A Student's Saving Grace or Downfall?<br />\nby Robert Smariga<br />\nYou've got a long night ahead<br />\nof you.

Win Streak Halted In Dramatic Loss<br />\nJays Sunk After 16-14 Lead As Navy Escapes With 78-35 Win<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\nFor a while, it looked like the<br />\nJV basketball team might pull off<br />\none of the biggest upsets in<br />\nHopkins history. The Blue Jays,<br />\nwhose tallest man is barely above<br />\nsix feet tall, were giving the<br />\nNaval Academy's JV all they<br />\ncould handle. After five minutes<br />\nwere gone in the first half, Coach<br />\nWeb Johnson seriously considered calling a timeout so that<br />\nhis team could just look at the<br />\nscoreboard and savor the moment. Hopkins was not only staying close to a Division I school,<br />\nthey were actually holding a<br />\n16-14 lead.<br />\nHopkins came out on fire, using a slow-down offense to keep<br />\nthe ball away from the explosive<br />\nNavy offense. After using almost<br />\nall of the 45-second clock, the<br />\nBlue Jays were getting key<br />\nbuckets from Greg Bronshvag<br />\nand three-pointers from Steve<br />\nBlumenthal. Freshman Tim<br />\nCoyle got some key rebounds,<br />\ndespite being about five inches<br />\nshorter than the Middies' rebounders. If the Jays kept up their<br /><br />\nearly pace, Coach Johnson probably would have been offered a<br />\nlucrative contract to coach the<br />\nNew York Knicks.<br />\nWell, as you've probably<br />\nguessed, the Naval Academy<br />\nfinally disposed of the pesky Blue<br />\nJays and coasted to a 78-35 victory. In the end, the Middies were<br />\njust too much for Hopkins to handle, despite some gutsy defense<br />\nby Mike Stern and Stefano<br />\nAgolini,. Blumenthal led all<br />\nHopkins scorers with 19 points,<br />\nfollowed by Greg Bronshvag with<br />\n8, Pat Furey and Tim Coyle with<br />\n3 apiece, and \"Sheep\" Tarver<br />\nwith 2. Ian Krop did a good job<br />\nat the point, despite some heavy<br />\npressure from the Navy guards.<br />\nEarlier in the week, Hopkins<br />\nsaw their one-game winning streak<br />\ngo down the tubes as they fell to<br />\nFranklin and Marshall 103-73.<br />\nThe Blue Jays played an excellent<br />\nfirst half, led by Kevin Roller and<br />\nGreg Gold, and trailed by only<br />\none at the intermission.

Also, in case you're<br />\nwondering, Coach Johnson was<br />\nupset by Michael Jordan last Friday. A rematch has been scheduled, but the time and location have<br />\nyet to be announced.<br /><br />\nWelcome Back To Big Al<br />\nThe leaves are turning up their<br />\ntoes and here we are, ready for<br />\nanother go-round, and I have to<br />\nsay right off the top that hoops,<br />\nbuckets, nets, roundball\u2014<br />\nwhatever you want to call it\u2014it's<br />\nout of sight. Everything is<br />\nbeautiful, and it's going to get<br />\nbetter, but:<br />\nIt's time we stopped whipping<br /><br />\nthat, then what are they doing,<br />\nout walking around the stadium<br />\non Saturday afternoons, wearing<br />\ntheir ascot?<br />\nNO university president can<br />\nexpect that he can have automatic<br />\nalumni meetings every Saturday<br />\nin the fall and on the weekends in<br />\nwintertime, without being aware<br />\nthat there are certain yeses and<br /><br />\nthat automatic punching bag in<br />\nShawnee Mission, the NCAA,<br />\nand put the blame on the<br />\ndownside problems of college<br />\nbasketball\u2014and our inability to<br />\nhandle them\u2014where it really<br />\nbelongs. I'm talking about the<br />\nproblems we have now with<br />\nrecruiting violations, academics,<br />\npayments under the table,<br />\nstudent-athletes who aren't<br />\neducated\u2014let's put the blame for<br />\nall this right where it belongs, in<br />\nthe laps of the presidents of the<br />\nDivision I universities.<br />\nFirst off, you must realize that<br />\nthese people are a unique combination of scholar, educator,<br />\npolitician, fundraiser, and labor<br />\nnegotiator. And that, in addition,<br />\nmost are also uniquely selfcentered, academic Captain<br />\nQueegs who are out of touch,<br />\nwalking around thinking there's<br />\nnothing more important than finding out who stole the<br />\nstrawberries.<br />\nToo often, when it comes to<br />\nsomething important, university<br />\npresidents are too content to play<br />\nPontius Pilate, washing their<br />\nhands of whatever comes their<br />\nway. Or, acting like an ostrich<br />\nwith its head in the sand, or a<br />\nwhale that doesn't come up for a<br />\nblow quite often enough.<br />\nSad as it may seem, their relationship to college athletics is like<br />\nthat of the bachelor who's dating:<br />\nHe likes the girl on Saturday<br />\nnight, because she's dressed like<br />\nAstor's pet horse. But come<br />\nMonday morning, when she has<br />\ndiarrhea, and curlers in her hair,<br />\nhe doesn't want to know her.<br />\nThat's how they feel when it<br />\ncomes to college sports.<br />\nThe truth of the matter is, the<br />\npresident of the university should<br />\nbe where it's at\u2014like the Oval<br />\nOffice when the red phone rings.<br />\nHe should be the Frank Sinatra,<br />\nthe Lee Iacocca, the Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen. He should be the<br />\nboss. Whatever happens at the<br />\nathletic department, the buck<br />\nshould stop at the president's<br />\ndesk. And if they don't realize<br /><br />\nnos that have to be answered.<br />\nLike the idea that, somewhere<br />\ndown the line, student-athletes are<br />\ngoing to have to receive some<br />\ntype of financial compensation\u2014<br />\neven if, by comparison, a migrant<br />\nworker tips more than the<br />\nstudent-athlete is given to live on.<br />\nHey, the world of incomeproducing sports is truly no inventory, no union, no pensions\u2014<br />\nand yet, if any of these young<br />\npeople so much as sell a complimentary ticket, it immediately<br />\ncalls for the creation of a committee to have Devil's Island reopened.<br />\nWhat I'm trying to say to you,<br />\npresidents of the universities, is,<br />\nyou don't need the committees.<br />\nAs Harry S. Truman put it, the<br />\nbuck stops at your desk. You can<br />\nput up as many studies and committees and athletic boards and<br />\nconsultants, with all their buffalo<br />\nchips, and what it still breaks<br />\ndown to is that you're the boss.<br />\nYou're the only one that can say,<br />\nenough is enough.<br />\nThink about it. What happens<br />\nto the wagon, if you won't keep<br />\nthe reins in your hands?<br />\nYou're great at giving tests. So<br />\nlet me give one to you. Just lay<br />\non a few questions here, questions that don't need explanations, or long memos with paper<br />\nclips. Questions you can answer<br />\nsimply, with just a yes or a no.<br />\nShould freshman be eligible for<br />\nvarsity play? Yes or no. Check<br />\nwhich one.<br />\nShould student athletes be<br />\ngiven a monthly stipend? Yes or<br />\nno. Check which one.<br />\nWhen there's a need at home,<br />\na parent's death, sickness, or a<br />\nfamily problem, will the shoot<br />\npay for the student-athlete's plane<br />\nticket? Yes or no.<br />\nIs commercialization of<br />\nundergraduates for revenue acceptable? Yes or no.<br />\nShould coaches, after a threeyear probationary period, receive<br />\nfaculty tenure? Yes or no.<br />\nShould the student body be<br />\nallowed representative seating at<br /><br />\nincome-producing sporting<br />\nevents? Yes or no.<br />\nAnd finally, would you explain<br />\nto your coaches what a<br />\n\"representative season\" is, in<br />\nrelation to wins and losses? Yes<br />\nor no.<br />\nI'm going to say it once again:<br />\nThe people who should answer<br />\nfor these problems are not the<br />\nguys at the NCAA, because they<br />\nwork at the pleasure of the<br />\npresidents of the universities. The<br />\npresidents should decide the<br />\npolicies, instead of hiding behind<br />\ncommittees or boards that never<br />\nsay anything, that dance in the<br />\nshadows until the band goes<br />\nhome.<br />\nHey guys, come out from<br />\nbehind your desks. You're the<br />\nonly person in the stable. It<br />\ndoesn't make any difference what<br />\nthe jockey says, what the trainer<br />\nsays, what the groom says, or<br />\neven what the horse says. You<br />\nown the stable. You should set the<br />\nrules. You have the authority to<br />\nput responsibility in the proper<br />\narea of your athletic departments.<br />\nFor example: If we claim that<br />\nwe have the best faculties in the<br />\nworld at our universities, then<br />\nwhy is it so difficult to educate a<br />\nperson who gets a 650, rather<br />\nthan a 700, on his SAT's? If it's<br />\nthat difficult, then I think we'd<br />\nbetter start checking on the ability of our faculty. Or are we there<br />\nto educate, or just to educate the<br />\neducated?<br />\nTo sum up, I'd say, college<br />\npresidents, make decisions. Make<br />\n'em, even if they are unpopular.<br />\nIt's time for hardball, or college<br />\nsports is going to lose its<br />\ncredibility throughout the country. Right now, there's a<br />\ncredibility gap in discipline, in the<br />\nacademic end, and perhaps most<br />\nimportantly, on the moral side of<br />\nthings.<br />\nSo far, you've been content to<br />\nput the spotlight on the wrong<br />\npeople\u2014the athletic departments,<br />\nthe coaches, the student athletes.<br />\nThey're not in charge. And yet,<br />\nyou'd want everybody to believe<br />\nit's them who have egg on their<br />\ntie.<br />\nJump in the water. Find out<br />\nwhat the real world is like. I<br />\nknow you like to picture yourself<br />\nas Gregory Peck going after the<br />\nGreat White Whale, but there's<br />\nmore to it than showing up at the<br />\nparking lot in your best tweed<br />\nsport coat for the tailgate on<br />\nSaturdays.<br />\nCome on, you presidents.<br />\nCome out and say what you want.<br />\nThe NCAA answers to you. If<br />\nyou guys have the courage to say<br />\nit shouldn't be, then it won't be.<br />\nBut it's time, on the abovementioned questions, for you to<br />\ntake charge of your own destiny<br />\ninside the jock world.

Now is your chance to party hearty and get to know all those great, lovable people in Hopkins' Greek Society. Some pretty familiar<br /><br />\nnames were members of fraternities that have chapters here at Hopkins, and this week's quiz asks you to match these names to their appropriate frat. Here is a little advice: go to the different houses and ask<br />\n:4 the brothers and sisters for some help. Whatever you do, have fun. There are some frats that do not have chapters here, but I guess it wouldn't be a good quiz if I didn't try to stump you. Now get out there<br />\n'<br />\n4 and rush, rush, russsssh. Get your entries to the News-Letter Acropolis (jadis, le Chalet, ne Gatehouse) by Wednesday the eleventh at seventeen bells. See you on the radio.<br /><br />\nResults: Talk about entries... One Geek sent me a seven page computer printout to solve the problem. Too bad he was wrong. And confusing. Its a shame I don't give points for stumping the ole QM.<br />\nOr extra credit. This week's winner is Sandra Merrick for being persistent (and cute, too). The answer was supposed to be 4!, but that assumes a nautical mile to be 6000 ft. A guy from the Coast Guard<br />\n,14 told me that value, but since then I've seen values ranging from 6076-6080 ft. I guess it is true, never trust a sailor on leave. Anyhow the answers were A)-1, B)6000, C)283200. D) 10200, E) 28, F) 3215,<br />\nG) 1024, H) 3, I) 88.1, J) 3.1, K) 7, L) 7, M) Don't ask, N) 2, 0)4.95, P) 1.35, Q) 4, R) 6, S) 20, 1) 6, U) 8, V) 2, W)2, X) 1, Y) 1, Z) 4! or something between 1919.2! and 2020!. If you want to<br />\n:4<br />\nknow the values that is your business, I never asked you to solve once you found Z. Ha Ha, the joke is on you.<br />\nIn reply to Mr. Ungrateful (see page 8), New York is also a real State, giving Schroeder a concussion proves the old addage of No Brain No Pain, and personally I feel that if I broke your typewriter there<br />\n'<br />\n41<br />\nIf<br />\nwould be one less goofball here in the pages of the News-Letter (Lord knows we have enough!).
