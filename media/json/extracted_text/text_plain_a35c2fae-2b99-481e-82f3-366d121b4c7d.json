While<br />\nthe authorities are about it, there<br />\nis another improvement that might<br />\nwell be made and which there is<br />\nstill time to make.<br />\nAt present a great many students<br />\npay $1.50 per annum for clean<br />\ntowels. By .the first of April,<br />\npunctually, everybody begins taking exercise out at Homewood instead of in the cage. Under the<br />\npresent -obnoxious -system,- men who<br />\nare not regular members of a<br />\n\"Varsity, squad must go without<br />\ntowels '-at Homewood unless they<br />\nbring .them themselves; and if this<br />\nwere not bad enough, the team<br />\nmanagers have to pay from twentyfive cents to fifty cents a dozen to<br />\ncolored men to carry suitcases of<br />\ntowels out to the field for the team<br />\nmembers.<br />\nAll this bother is certainly unnecessary, and may be obviated in<br />\na very simple manner. The towel<br />\ncompanies are of course just as<br />\nwilling to deliver the towels at<br />\nHomewood as at the cage, and as<br />\nthe \"new policies\" now require that<br />\nno Man may have a key at Homewood, but that the lockers shall be<br />\nunlocked by a man who has to stay<br />\nthere all afternoon for that purpose, why shouldn't he also be<br />\nintrusted with the distribution of<br />\ntowels.<br />\n. We should therefore like to suggest to the director of the gymnasium that this matter be arranged so<br />\nthat the teams are saved the expense and the individuals the<br />\ntrouble, that is incurred under the<br />\npresent system.

I<br />\nhave never been desirous Of critiCiSing or even raising my humble<br />\nvoice above a whisper in any of the<br />\ngreat state affairs, but there is a<br />\nPew athletic policy much discussed<br />\nin the columns of your paper which<br />\nShould like to say a word or two<br />\nabout now, if I could but do so<br />\nwithout bringing the wrath of the<br />\ngods upon my head. I am making<br />\nan appeal in good faith\u2014as an evidence of this I am signing my name<br />\nto . lily letter.<br />\nHopkins athletics are on the upward climb; we wish to do all in<br />\nOur power to keep them going up.<br />\nTo take away student control and<br />\nManagement of athletics is to put<br />\ntD death a movement originated<br />\nzud maintained for a number of<br />\n<br />\nyears by them. There are and<br />\nhave been many crushing blows to<br />\nthe original spirit of college athletics. The latest example is that<br />\nof our new managership policy.<br />\nThe undergraduate .manager has<br />\nbeen reduced to a bat chaser on the<br />\nbaseball team, and corresponding<br />\npositions on the other teams. He<br />\nis stripped of his responsibility and<br />\nany chance to put personality into<br />\nhis work, or to \"make good.\" The<br />\nabsolute heads are the controllers<br />\nand the Athletic Association has<br />\nbecome a business organization for<br />\nthe promotion of business ends,<br />\namong which are the paying of the<br />\nsalaries of managers, coaches and<br />\npress agents. The primary objects<br />\nof student athletics are fast becoming old fashioned. The pleasure and<br />\nenjoyment of sport, physical development and health are all sacrifices to the business end of the<br />\nthing. At last the last vestage of<br />\nstudent control has slipped from<br />\nus\u2014the managers are no longer our<br />\nown.<br />\nWhat I mean is evidenced by the<br />\nrules lately laid down by the Athletic Board. Upon reading the<br />\nrules we find phrases such as these:<br />\n\"He (the undergraduate manager)<br />\nshould have control, under the direction of the graduate manager,<br />\nof the equipment and correspondence with other teams.\" \"He (the<br />\ngraduate manager) should make all<br />\nfinal schedules and terms under the<br />\ndirection of the director of the gymnasium, and should have authority<br />\nover all undergraduate inanagers.\"<br />\nBesides all this, we have the press<br />\nagent idea set forth again, despite<br />\nthe repeated jolts. THE NEWS-LETTER has given it this year. Also, we<br />\nhave such rules as these: \"Neither<br />\nundergraduate ma na ger s nor<br />\ncoaches, nor others in the employ<br />\nof the Athletic Association should<br />\nwrite athletic news for city newspapers for emolument.\" \"He (the<br />\nundergraduate manager)should not<br />\nbe connected with the business management of any college publication<br />\n(or any student activity?).\" \"No<br />\n\u2022 theatre parties should be given to<br />\na team until after the season, etc.,\"<br />\nad infinitum.<br />\nLet us create a better ideal in<br />\nour athletics than those suggested<br />\nby our new policy, and get closer<br />\nto the true spirit of the movement.<br />\nLet us try to get away from the<br />\nbusiness or professional spirit now<br />\nthreatening our great activity. But,<br />\nabove all things, let us render to<br />\nCesar what is his with respect to<br />\nthe government by the .whole.<br />\nLAURENCE B. CHENOWETII.<br />\nApril 20, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nThe so-called athletic policy as<br />\nset forth in a recent issue of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER Seems to me to be<br />\nalmost entirely unnecessary and directly in opposition to the ideas and<br />\nwishes of the whole undergraduate<br />\nbody. Its tone, if nothing else,<br />\nmakes one feel as if the two \"all<br />\nmighties\" were to run all the athletics, and that all the \"say\" was<br />\ntaken away from the general stu-<br />\n<br />\ndent body. For instance: The captains of the teams know how regularly a man attends practices without any such ridiculous performance as keeping a roll. The mere<br />\nidea of this reminds one of the<br />\nclassroom, and the signing and<br />\ncountersigning of cards to be a<br />\ncandidate for a team also seems to<br />\nme to accomplish nothing. Another<br />\ninstance of poor athletic policy is,<br />\nI think, the taking away from the<br />\nundergraduate managers all real<br />\npower. Also, at all other places<br />\nthe captains and coaches of the<br />\nteams are usually consulted as to<br />\nthe schedules for the next season,<br />\nwhich is certainly not always done<br />\nhere at Hopkins. Many outsiders<br />\nand students here have come to me<br />\nand asked why we had such a poor<br />\nschedule for next fall. When the<br />\nmanager was asked , about it he<br />\nsaid: \"I didn't have anything to do<br />\nwith it.\" Undoubtedly, 'next season's football schedule is rotten.<br />\nGEORGE M.

But as there<br />\nare some questions which require<br />\nextensive discussion, I feel that the<br />\ndiscussion should be carried on at<br />\na mass-meeting of the Student<br />\nCouncil, if by any chance those<br />\nwho appear offended have enough<br />\ninterest in the subject to take an<br />\nhour orto to come to such a meeting.<br />\n\u2022 So far as -the first letter in the<br />\nApril 20, 1912..<br />\nlast issue of THE 1\\11,VS-LETTER is<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nconcerned, my opinion is that it is<br />\nMr. Kuehn 'seems to be very utter rot to concede to ,the Student<br />\nmuch peeved because I . had some- Ccuncil one Whit of thefinal power.<br />\nthing to say about President Rem- Such a thing as requiring ratifisen's resignation.

At least they are<br />\nafraid to sign their names to them.<br />\nThe fact is, that it is not the policy,<br />\nbut the men to whom that policy<br />\ngives power, to which the writers<br />\nobject, namely Mr. Holmes and Dr.<br />\nAbercrombie. But why not look<br />\nat this matter in a broad-minded<br />\nway and see that it is no vain thirst<br />\nof power which makes these men<br />\nheads, but the desire to help our<br />\nUniversity. To be sure there may<br />\nbe different opinions as to whether<br />\ntheir ideas are exactly the best, but<br />\nI am sure that if the \"men who<br />\nknow better how to run things than<br />\nthey\" will take the trouble to convince them of better theories they<br />\nwill change, if they see it advisable.<br />\nI feel sure that every one will agree<br />\nthat the work Mr. Holmes has done<br />\nfor our athletics has been of such<br />\na character as could have been done<br />\nby no other man we could have put<br />\nin his position.<br />\nSo I say I think that this policy<br />\nis not at fault. I know you may<br />\nsay that any policy is wrong which<br />\nputs one man so. absolutely in control. But can you think of any<br />\nbetter form of policy? No! We<br />\ncannot do this thing half way. We<br />\nmust have this as it stands or not at<br />\nall. We may not agree that Mr.<br />\nHolmes uses his powers properly,<br />\nbut let's go about it in the right<br />\nway and show him where he is<br />\nwrong. We are all working for<br />\nthe same end\u2014the good of one college\u2014so let's all pull together, come<br />\nto a mass-meeting and discuss this<br />\nthing to our own satisfaction, instead of by our knocks satisfying<br />\nthe public that we are continually<br />\nsquabbling with those who are in<br />\npower.

By .the first of April,<br />\npunctually, everybody begins taking exercise out at Homewood instead of in the cage. Under the<br />\npresent -obnoxious -system,- men who<br />\nare not regular members of a<br />\n\"Varsity, squad must go without<br />\ntowels '-at Homewood unless they<br />\nbring .them themselves; and if this<br />\nwere not bad enough, the team<br />\nmanagers have to pay from twentyfive cents to fifty cents a dozen to<br />\ncolored men to carry suitcases of<br />\ntowels out to the field for the team<br />\nmembers.<br />\nAll this bother is certainly unnecessary, and may be obviated in<br />\na very simple manner. The towel<br />\ncompanies are of course just as<br />\nwilling to deliver the towels at<br />\nHomewood as at the cage, and as<br />\nthe \"new policies\" now require that<br />\nno Man may have a key at Homewood, but that the lockers shall be<br />\nunlocked by a man who has to stay<br />\nthere all afternoon for that purpose, why shouldn't he also be<br />\nintrusted with the distribution of<br />\ntowels.<br />\n. We should therefore like to suggest to the director of the gymnasium that this matter be arranged so<br />\nthat the teams are saved the expense and the individuals the<br />\ntrouble, that is incurred under the<br />\npresent system.

I<br />\nhave never been desirous Of critiCiSing or even raising my humble<br />\nvoice above a whisper in any of the<br />\ngreat state affairs, but there is a<br />\nPew athletic policy much discussed<br />\nin the columns of your paper which<br />\nShould like to say a word or two<br />\nabout now, if I could but do so<br />\nwithout bringing the wrath of the<br />\ngods upon my head.

There are and<br />\nhave been many crushing blows to<br />\nthe original spirit of college athletics. The latest example is that<br />\nof our new managership policy.<br />\nThe undergraduate .manager has<br />\nbeen reduced to a bat chaser on the<br />\nbaseball team, and corresponding<br />\npositions on the other teams. He<br />\nis stripped of his responsibility and<br />\nany chance to put personality into<br />\nhis work, or to \"make good.\" The<br />\nabsolute heads are the controllers<br />\nand the Athletic Association has<br />\nbecome a business organization for<br />\nthe promotion of business ends,<br />\namong which are the paying of the<br />\nsalaries of managers, coaches and<br />\npress agents. The primary objects<br />\nof student athletics are fast becoming old fashioned. The pleasure and<br />\nenjoyment of sport, physical development and health are all sacrifices to the business end of the<br />\nthing. At last the last vestage of<br />\nstudent control has slipped from<br />\nus\u2014the managers are no longer our<br />\nown.<br />\nWhat I mean is evidenced by the<br />\nrules lately laid down by the Athletic Board. Upon reading the<br />\nrules we find phrases such as these:<br />\n\"He (the undergraduate manager)<br />\nshould have control, under the direction of the graduate manager,<br />\nof the equipment and correspondence with other teams.\" \"He (the<br />\ngraduate manager) should make all<br />\nfinal schedules and terms under the<br />\ndirection of the director of the gymnasium, and should have authority<br />\nover all undergraduate inanagers.\"<br />\nBesides all this, we have the press<br />\nagent idea set forth again, despite<br />\nthe repeated jolts. THE NEWS-LETTER has given it this year. Also, we<br />\nhave such rules as these: \"Neither<br />\nundergraduate ma na ger s nor<br />\ncoaches, nor others in the employ<br />\nof the Athletic Association should<br />\nwrite athletic news for city newspapers for emolument.\" \"He (the<br />\nundergraduate manager)should not<br />\nbe connected with the business management of any college publication<br />\n(or any student activity?).\" \"No<br />\n\u2022 theatre parties should be given to<br />\na team until after the season, etc.,\"<br />\nad infinitum.<br />\nLet us create a better ideal in<br />\nour athletics than those suggested<br />\nby our new policy, and get closer<br />\nto the true spirit of the movement.<br />\nLet us try to get away from the<br />\nbusiness or professional spirit now<br />\nthreatening our great activity. But,<br />\nabove all things, let us render to<br />\nCesar what is his with respect to<br />\nthe government by the .whole.<br />\nLAURENCE B. CHENOWETII.<br />\nApril 20, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nThe so-called athletic policy as<br />\nset forth in a recent issue of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER Seems to me to be<br />\nalmost entirely unnecessary and directly in opposition to the ideas and<br />\nwishes of the whole undergraduate<br />\nbody. Its tone, if nothing else,<br />\nmakes one feel as if the two \"all<br />\nmighties\" were to run all the athletics, and that all the \"say\" was<br />\ntaken away from the general stu-<br /><br />\ndent body. For instance: The captains of the teams know how regularly a man attends practices without any such ridiculous performance as keeping a roll. The mere<br />\nidea of this reminds one of the<br />\nclassroom, and the signing and<br />\ncountersigning of cards to be a<br />\ncandidate for a team also seems to<br />\nme to accomplish nothing. Another<br />\ninstance of poor athletic policy is,<br />\nI think, the taking away from the<br />\nundergraduate managers all real<br />\npower. Also, at all other places<br />\nthe captains and coaches of the<br />\nteams are usually consulted as to<br />\nthe schedules for the next season,<br />\nwhich is certainly not always done<br />\nhere at Hopkins. Many outsiders<br />\nand students here have come to me<br />\nand asked why we had such a poor<br />\nschedule for next fall. When the<br />\nmanager was asked , about it he<br />\nsaid: \"I didn't have anything to do<br />\nwith it.\" Undoubtedly, 'next season's football schedule is rotten.<br />\nGEORGE M.

At least they are<br />\nafraid to sign their names to them.<br />\nThe fact is, that it is not the policy,<br />\nbut the men to whom that policy<br />\ngives power, to which the writers<br />\nobject, namely Mr. Holmes and Dr.<br />\nAbercrombie. But why not look<br />\nat this matter in a broad-minded<br />\nway and see that it is no vain thirst<br />\nof power which makes these men<br />\nheads, but the desire to help our<br />\nUniversity. To be sure there may<br />\nbe different opinions as to whether<br />\ntheir ideas are exactly the best, but<br />\nI am sure that if the \"men who<br />\nknow better how to run things than<br />\nthey\" will take the trouble to convince them of better theories they<br />\nwill change, if they see it advisable.<br />\nI feel sure that every one will agree<br />\nthat the work Mr. Holmes has done<br />\nfor our athletics has been of such<br />\na character as could have been done<br />\nby no other man we could have put<br />\nin his position.<br />\nSo I say I think that this policy<br />\nis not at fault. I know you may<br />\nsay that any policy is wrong which<br />\nputs one man so. absolutely in control. But can you think of any<br />\nbetter form of policy? No! We<br />\ncannot do this thing half way. We<br />\nmust have this as it stands or not at<br />\nall. We may not agree that Mr.<br />\nHolmes uses his powers properly,<br />\nbut let's go about it in the right<br />\nway and show him where he is<br />\nwrong. We are all working for<br />\nthe same end\u2014the good of one college\u2014so let's all pull together, come<br />\nto a mass-meeting and discuss this<br />\nthing to our own satisfaction, instead of by our knocks satisfying<br />\nthe public that we are continually<br />\nsquabbling with those who are in<br />\npower. Don't begrudge a man the<br />\npower to which he has attained, but<br />\nstand behind-- him and help him use<br />\nthat power in the right way!<br />\nJOHN S.
