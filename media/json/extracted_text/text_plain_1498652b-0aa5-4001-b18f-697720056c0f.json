Major Metzger ended his<br />\ndetailed report by saying:<br />\n\"This unit is considered by me<br />\nto be a model unit. Major Garey<br />\nis deserving of the highest praise<br />\nand commendation of the success<br />\nattained by his unit at this university. I strongly recommend<br />\nthat this college be given the rating of 'Distinguished College.'<br />\nSuch a rating is clearly deserved.\"<br />\nSuch comments as these are fi-equent in the report. They are typical of the enthusiasm expressed<br />\nby Major Metzger. He speaks of<br />\nthe loyalty and the high caliber of<br />\nmen enrolled in the R. 0. T. C.<br />\nAccording to the report, all were<br />\nextremely enthusiastic and full of<br />\npraise for the army personnel on<br />\nduty there. The interest in the R.<br />\n0. T.
