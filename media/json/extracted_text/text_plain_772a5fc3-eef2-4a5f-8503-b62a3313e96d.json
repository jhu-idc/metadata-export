The following is an interview conducted with Dr.<br />\nArthur Stinchcombe. Chairman of the<br />\nSocial Relations Department and head<br />\nof the Hopkins branch of The InterUniversity Committee on Foreign P?licy<br />\nwhich will conduct the forum. The<br />\ninterview was conducted Tuesday evening by N-L staffers Caleb Deschanel<br />\nand John Brickman.<br />\nNL: Dr. Stinchcombe, can you tell us<br />\nsomething about the Inter-University<br />\nCommittee?<br />\n<br />\nMOODY<br />\nsion of the Shriver Hall lecture.<br />\nThe more aggressive members of the<br />\ngroup stated an obligation to the International Days of Peace, designated,<br />\nworld-wide, for Saturday and Sunday.<br />\nThey stated in addition an importance<br />\nof \"causing a disturbance inside Shriver<br />\nHall during Rusk's speech to dramatize<br />\nour grievance.\" This move, it was said<br />\n\"would impress upon Rusk the dissension in the academic community in regard to the administration's policy in<br />\nViet Nam.\"<br />\nThe decision, which was eventually<br />\ntaken against any tactics that would<br />\nbreak up the assemblage, was done so<br />\nin recognition of the ultimate detriment<br />\nto the University and to the SDS group<br />\nby such action. It was taken as well<br />\nwith the recognition that the object of<br />\nthe organization is to \"expand its organization to include as much of the<br />\ncommunity as possible.\"<br />\nAnd that this goal is furthered by an<br />\nappearance of good conduct.<br />\nThe general tone of the debate was<br />\nundoubtedly intensified by the recent<br />\narticle in the News American evening<br />\nedition of October 11, relating the local<br />\nstudent liberal movement to a nationwide Communist action front. This<br />\narticle was followed by a rebuttal of its<br />\nstatements by a member of SDS at<br />\nHopkins. Peter Dawidowicz, in an article<br />\non October 12.<br />\n<br />\n5: The Inter-University Committee<br />\non Foreign Policy, consisting of faculty<br />\nmembers from Homewood, the Hopkins<br />\nMedical Institutions, Goucher and Morgan State, was founded in order to<br />\nprovide these faculty members a chance<br />\nto discuss current issues in foreign policy and related areas, with the opportunity to call upon expertise certain<br />\nmembers may have in relevant fields.<br />\nThe general theme we have chosen for<br />\na proposed series of seminars and<br />\nluncheon meetings is \"Revolution in the<br />\nworld and the American response.\"<br />\nVietnam, of course, is the issue which<br />\nthe United States is putting the most<br />\nmoney into, and will undoubtedly occupy a major portion of our time. But<br />\nwe intend to consider other fields as<br />\nwell. For instance, there is a man in<br />\nthe Social Relations Department\u2014Dr.<br />\nBreton\u2014who is French Canadian, and<br />\nwho is quite interested in the Quebec<br />\nseparatist movement. A discussion of<br />\nthis is a possibility. I myself am interested in economic development of Latin<br />\nAmerican countries. Time might be<br />\ndevoted to this.<br />\nNL: Could you list the Hopkins faculty members active on the Committee?<br />\nS: OK. The people who were at the<br />\norganizational meeting on the Home=<br />\nwood campus last Tuesday were myself,<br />\nDave Bramhall from Geography, John<br />\nOwen from Economics, and Charles<br />\nBarker and Steven Ambrose from History. These things are quite informal,<br />\nand, you know, you can rank people<br />\naccording to their level of activity; any<br />\nparticular meeting will cut that rank in<br />\n<br />\nSTINCHCOMBE<br />\na certain place, and the people who<br />\nwould come to an organizational meeting<br />\nare more committed thn those who<br />\ndon't. So there are others who might<br />\nbe willing to speak on certain topics of<br />\ntheir competence. You get some people<br />\nIn the group who are concerned\u2014like<br />\nmyself\u2014over long term and on a large<br />\nnumber of issues about which it is felt<br />\nthat American foreign policy is not<br />\nbased upon an adequate analysis of the<br />\nrealities of the situation. In other words;<br />\none sort of extreme would be some fundamental dissatisfaction with American<br />\nforeign policy. The other sort of extreme might be found in a guy who<br />\nwas interested in a specific topic and<br />\nwould be willing to talk to the group<br />\nabout it. Between these extremes, there<br />\nare all grades of people. There've been a<br />\ngroup of people from local campuses<br />\nwho have been together a number of<br />\nyears, in a group called the Arms Control Seminar. That includes Barker from<br />\nhere, Jerome Frank from the Medical<br />\nSchool. and Professor of history William Neumann from Goucher.

It's their business whether they undertake<br />\ncivil disobedience or not. I personally am inclined against civil<br />\ndisobedience to interfere with a<br />\nman talking. But, you know, I<br />\ncan conceive of circumstances<br />\nunder which students consider it<br />\nimportant enough to object to<br />\nthe way a man talks to undertake civil disobedience and if<br />\nthey were to do it in my class, I<br />\nwould try to take it like a gentleman.

I think<br />\nthat if a man chooses a university as a public forum, that is<br />\none of the conditions he should<br />\nmorally be pressured to accept.<br />\nHowever, if he doesn't accept,<br />\nI am in favor of letting him talk<br />\nanyway.<br />\nNL: What Is to be done after<br />\nRusk's speech?<br />\n<br />\nS: Directly after the oonclusion of the lecture, there will be<br />\na discussion of the speech and<br />\nrelevant issues, to take place in<br />\nLevering Hall. In organizing it,<br />\nwhat we tried to do was to recruit faculty members with different points of view who are<br />\ncompetent to talk on the issues:<br />\nhave them talk for a while, and<br />\nthen open it up for general discussion as long as it lasts. I will<br />\nprobably chair the discussion.<br />\nOther speakers should be Dr.<br />\nAmbrose, who will open it up,<br />\nand then Dr. Owen and Dr.<br />\nBramhall. We all should be expected to attack the Administration's foreign policy. Then, we<br />\nwill have someone who seems<br />\nmost competent to defend the<br />\nAdministration's position. We<br />\nalso thought that Students for a<br />\nDemocratic Society represented a<br />\nparticular point of view toward<br />\nRusk and Administration foreign<br />\npolicy, and that they are a<br />\nlegitimate part of the dialogue<br />\nwhich should go on in the universities.

This kind of statement is the worst<br />\nkind of yellow journalism; it should not be found in a responsible newspaper. The source of the correlation between the demonstrations and the communist party comes<br />\nfrom an obscure release from a former FBI counter<br />\nspy and ultra rightist advertising man from New Hampshire: Herbert Philhrick.

He was responsible for the convictions of 11 communists in 1949 and later published<br />\na book entitled \"I Lead Three Lives\" recounting his ex-<br />\n<br />\nWe hope that the News-American will learn to find<br />\nstories; not manufacture them.<br />\n<br />\n\"Universal deviate\" augments \"moral\" forces<br />\nI wonder, too, what Rand<br />\nCorporation thinker would care<br />\nto turn his strategic planning<br />\ntoward the answers to the following questions: Would the FiftyFourth Faggot Battalion be satisfied with the taper of their<br />\nfatigues? Is the Army planning<br />\nto include hairdressing in its vocational training program? And<br />\nhow would you keep things under<br />\ncontrol in the shower room?<br />\nWhat would be done if, to a<br />\nman, the members of the paranoid platoon of the Sixty-eighth<br />\nPsychotics demanded a seat on<br />\n<br />\nOCCUPATIONAL<br />\n<br />\ndemonstrations to he held here tomorrow.<br />\nWhile Herbert Philbrick was undoubtedly a competent counter spy it can hardly be evidence that he is<br />\nnow competent to make such statements.<br />\n<br />\nperiences as a counter spy.<br />\nIn this well publicized hook, which was later<br />\nadapted into a popular television series, Philbrick helped<br />\nto expose the communist's conspiracy against the U.S.<br />\nby depicting their activities as he noted them while serving as a counter spy. He stated in his book that the<br />\ncommunists seek to split our society and evoke intense<br />\nconflict. In a speech at Loyola College here in Baltimore<br />\nin April of 1954 Philbrick reiterated this point and stated<br />\nthat the communists hope to gain control of the government by \"eliminating the middle of the roader\". He<br />\nalso advised his Loyola audience not to revert to smear<br />\ntactics that split or divide the public and not to look<br />\nfor communists under every bed. Yet with the release<br />\nof his current News Bulletin it appears that Philbrick<br />\nhas forgotten the lessons he intended to teach the American public. His new found position denies a middle of<br />\nthe road. The News American in their printing of the<br />\nstory concerning the News Bulletin never learned the<br />\nlesson, if indeed they are concerned.<br />\nSuch a story as the one that appeared in the News<br />\nAmerican creates erroneous impressions about poltical<br />\norganizations on campus. For the most part the politicos<br />\nat Hopkins are led by responsible students. They generally take an intelligent and mature approach to their<br />\nactivities and rarely approach the idiotic and dispieable<br />\nsmear tactics that have been used by Philbrick and The<br />\nNews American. That the News American should assume<br />\nthe veracity of statements by Philbrick is questionable;<br />\nbut to draw upon Philbrick as evidence that the demonstrations here are communist inspired is extremely<br />\nobscure.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nThe diameatood Scene<br />\nHershey At The Bar<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n\"Is<br />\n<br />\nMts.--Taylor's Climb To Fame<br />\nBy MIKE MICHAELSON<br />\nIt is not uncommon, at an institution like Johns Hopkins, for<br />\nan undergraduate to come into<br />\ncontact with great men. Leading<br />\nauthors, prominent educators,<br />\nand world-renowned leaders of<br />\ncrucial scientific research are an<br />\nIntegral part of the total university experience. What is unusual,<br />\nhowever, even in a school of<br />\nHopkins' caliber, is to find an<br />\nundergraduate with almost<br />\nequally impressive credentials.<br />\nDaniel Taylor climbs mountans, and he climbs them well.<br />\nAlthough many people still view<br />\nmountain climbing as more of a<br />\nsport than a true science, Dan<br />\ntakes his \"sport\" seriously. What<br />\nis more, eminent scientists, proThe<br />\nmountaineers,<br />\nfessional<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, and<br />\nthe United States Army take<br />\nDan seriously. So seriously in<br />\nfact, that Hopkins and the Army<br />\nhelped finance his three month<br />\nsummer sojourn in the Himalayas. Tbe results of Dan's expedition: valuable medical and<br />\ngeological data, and a world's<br />\nrecord for the highest solo traverse in mountaineering history.<br />\n<br />\nSetting out for the Shagri<br />\nmountain range in the Himalayas toward the end of May, the<br />\nexpedition did not return to the<br />\nStates until the fifth of September. Originally scheduled to<br />\nInclude three of America's finest<br />\nclimbers (including Willie Unsold, perhaps the best in the<br />\nworld, famous for his traverse of<br />\nMt. Everset), the expedition included none of them when it<br />\nfinally left. Dan was the only<br />\nclimber of significant experience.<br />\nThree previous trips to the<br />\nHimalayas had earned Taylor,<br />\nwho is only twenty, that appellation. Born in the U.S., Dan<br />\nmoved to India with his family<br />\nwhen he was only two, spending<br />\nthe next three and a half years<br />\nthere, and learning Hindi, his<br />\ntrue mother tongue. After two<br />\nyears in Boston, (his father<br />\ntaught at Harvard), Dan returned to India for another four<br />\nyears, this time picking up Punjabi dialects. Home again, and<br />\nthen, between his sophomore and<br />\njunior years in high school, back<br />\nto India, this time as a member<br />\nof a Harvard Sociological Research Team.<br />\n<br />\nFinally., at the conclusion of<br />\nhis freshman year at Hopkins,<br />\nthe most recent and significant<br />\nof his expeditions was initiated.<br />\nThe only American Himalayan<br />\nExpedition of 1965, the trip was<br />\nfinanced by a grant from the<br />\nUnited States Army and The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nMountain climbing cliches to the<br />\ncontrary, the Himalayas were<br />\nscaled not \"because they were<br />\nthere,\" but with serious scientific<br />\ngoals in mind, goals which were<br />\nfor the most part realized. For<br />\nthe Army, the members of the<br />\ngroup tested high altitude survival rations to be supplied to<br />\nour future astronauts. For Hopkins they brought back species of<br />\nhigh altitude rodents called Marmots, guinea pig-like animals<br />\nparticularly adaptable to medical<br />\nresearch.<br />\nBut as far as mountaineering<br />\nexploits are concerned, the results were not only satisfactory,<br />\nthey were spectacular. Dan and<br />\nfive \"first, ascents,\" climbs of<br />\nhis companions made a total of<br />\npeaks which had never before<br />\nbeen challenged Three of these<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\n\fFROM BELOW<br />\nPolitics and Culture<br />\n<br />\nHoppie On<br />\nWay Up<br />\n<br />\nby CHARLES CAPPER<br />\n(Continued from Page 6)<br />\nan academic address, with one<br />\nimportant exception \u2014 the Secretary will answer no questions.<br />\n<br />\nIf Rusk were here on the basis<br />\nof a scholar's interest in communicating his ideas on a subject, he would be delighted to<br />\navail himself of those techniques<br />\nof dialogue\u2014questions, clarifications, controversy\u2014that are imPortant means of communicating ideas.

It was taken as well<br />\nwith the recognition that the object of<br />\nthe organization is to \"expand its organization to include as much of the<br />\ncommunity as possible.\"<br />\nAnd that this goal is furthered by an<br />\nappearance of good conduct.<br />\nThe general tone of the debate was<br />\nundoubtedly intensified by the recent<br />\narticle in the News American evening<br />\nedition of October 11, relating the local<br />\nstudent liberal movement to a nationwide Communist action front. This<br />\narticle was followed by a rebuttal of its<br />\nstatements by a member of SDS at<br />\nHopkins. Peter Dawidowicz, in an article<br />\non October 12.<br /><br />\n5: The Inter-University Committee<br />\non Foreign Policy, consisting of faculty<br />\nmembers from Homewood, the Hopkins<br />\nMedical Institutions, Goucher and Morgan State, was founded in order to<br />\nprovide these faculty members a chance<br />\nto discuss current issues in foreign policy and related areas, with the opportunity to call upon expertise certain<br />\nmembers may have in relevant fields.<br />\nThe general theme we have chosen for<br />\na proposed series of seminars and<br />\nluncheon meetings is \"Revolution in the<br />\nworld and the American response.\"<br />\nVietnam, of course, is the issue which<br />\nthe United States is putting the most<br />\nmoney into, and will undoubtedly occupy a major portion of our time. But<br />\nwe intend to consider other fields as<br />\nwell. For instance, there is a man in<br />\nthe Social Relations Department\u2014Dr.<br />\nBreton\u2014who is French Canadian, and<br />\nwho is quite interested in the Quebec<br />\nseparatist movement. A discussion of<br />\nthis is a possibility. I myself am interested in economic development of Latin<br />\nAmerican countries. Time might be<br />\ndevoted to this.<br />\nNL: Could you list the Hopkins faculty members active on the Committee?<br />\nS: OK. The people who were at the<br />\norganizational meeting on the Home=<br />\nwood campus last Tuesday were myself,<br />\nDave Bramhall from Geography, John<br />\nOwen from Economics, and Charles<br />\nBarker and Steven Ambrose from History. These things are quite informal,<br />\nand, you know, you can rank people<br />\naccording to their level of activity; any<br />\nparticular meeting will cut that rank in<br /><br />\nSTINCHCOMBE<br />\na certain place, and the people who<br />\nwould come to an organizational meeting<br />\nare more committed thn those who<br />\ndon't. So there are others who might<br />\nbe willing to speak on certain topics of<br />\ntheir competence. You get some people<br />\nIn the group who are concerned\u2014like<br />\nmyself\u2014over long term and on a large<br />\nnumber of issues about which it is felt<br />\nthat American foreign policy is not<br />\nbased upon an adequate analysis of the<br />\nrealities of the situation. In other words;<br />\none sort of extreme would be some fundamental dissatisfaction with American<br />\nforeign policy. The other sort of extreme might be found in a guy who<br />\nwas interested in a specific topic and<br />\nwould be willing to talk to the group<br />\nabout it. Between these extremes, there<br />\nare all grades of people. There've been a<br />\ngroup of people from local campuses<br />\nwho have been together a number of<br />\nyears, in a group called the Arms Control Seminar.

In organizing it,<br />\nwhat we tried to do was to recruit faculty members with different points of view who are<br />\ncompetent to talk on the issues:<br />\nhave them talk for a while, and<br />\nthen open it up for general discussion as long as it lasts.

The source of the correlation between the demonstrations and the communist party comes<br />\nfrom an obscure release from a former FBI counter<br />\nspy and ultra rightist advertising man from New Hampshire: Herbert Philhrick.

Is the Army planning<br />\nto include hairdressing in its vocational training program? And<br />\nhow would you keep things under<br />\ncontrol in the shower room?<br />\nWhat would be done if, to a<br />\nman, the members of the paranoid platoon of the Sixty-eighth<br />\nPsychotics demanded a seat on<br /><br />\nOCCUPATIONAL<br /><br />\ndemonstrations to he held here tomorrow.<br />\nWhile Herbert Philbrick was undoubtedly a competent counter spy it can hardly be evidence that he is<br />\nnow competent to make such statements.<br /><br />\nperiences as a counter spy.<br />\nIn this well publicized hook, which was later<br />\nadapted into a popular television series, Philbrick helped<br />\nto expose the communist's conspiracy against the U.S.<br />\nby depicting their activities as he noted them while serving as a counter spy. He stated in his book that the<br />\ncommunists seek to split our society and evoke intense<br />\nconflict. In a speech at Loyola College here in Baltimore<br />\nin April of 1954 Philbrick reiterated this point and stated<br />\nthat the communists hope to gain control of the government by \"eliminating the middle of the roader\". He<br />\nalso advised his Loyola audience not to revert to smear<br />\ntactics that split or divide the public and not to look<br />\nfor communists under every bed. Yet with the release<br />\nof his current News Bulletin it appears that Philbrick<br />\nhas forgotten the lessons he intended to teach the American public. His new found position denies a middle of<br />\nthe road. The News American in their printing of the<br />\nstory concerning the News Bulletin never learned the<br />\nlesson, if indeed they are concerned.<br />\nSuch a story as the one that appeared in the News<br />\nAmerican creates erroneous impressions about poltical<br />\norganizations on campus. For the most part the politicos<br />\nat Hopkins are led by responsible students. They generally take an intelligent and mature approach to their<br />\nactivities and rarely approach the idiotic and dispieable<br />\nsmear tactics that have been used by Philbrick and The<br />\nNews American. That the News American should assume<br />\nthe veracity of statements by Philbrick is questionable;<br />\nbut to draw upon Philbrick as evidence that the demonstrations here are communist inspired is extremely<br />\nobscure.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nThe diameatood Scene<br />\nHershey At The Bar<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n,<br />\n\"Is<br /><br />\nMts.--Taylor's Climb To Fame<br />\nBy MIKE MICHAELSON<br />\nIt is not uncommon, at an institution like Johns Hopkins, for<br />\nan undergraduate to come into<br />\ncontact with great men.
