All<br />\nof this loss was made up by the Baltimore concerts, but this meant less<br />\nmoney for the Hullaboloos, which<br />\nare considerably in need of such<br />\nsupport. Besides this, the transportation facilities of the Eastern<br />\nShore are such as to require long<br />\nrailroad trips to cover relatively<br />\nshort distances. With the additional<br />\nidea that \"we have worn out our<br />\nwelcome,\" it seems eminently desirable to give this section of the<br />\nState time to recover.<br />\nFrederick, Hagerstown and Cumberland seem suitable places to give<br />\nconcerts, though the question of<br />\nmaking railroad connections remains to be considered. With<br />\nChristmas coming on Wednesday,<br />\nthe Clubs will probably leave the<br />\nnext day and give concerts on<br />\nThursday, Friday and Saturday<br />\nnights. -Jack Fulton, who has taken<br />\nover the work of training the Glee<br />\nClub and arranging the trips, has not<br />\nannounced anything definite as yet.<br />\nFollowing the football mass-meeting, last Wednesday, a very successful rehearsal of the Glee Club was<br />\nheld. It was decided to have rehearsals for the tenors on Mondays<br />\nat one o'clock, and for the bassos on<br />\nWednesdays, at the same hour. A<br />\ngen&al rehearsal will take place on<br />\nFridays. Fulton has requested any<br />\none knowing persons in Frederick,<br />\nHagerstown or Cumberland to giyie<br />\nhis name to him in order.to increase<br />\nthe list of patrons.<br />\n<br />\nOn Wednesaay last, a mass-meeting of the entire student body was<br />\nheld in Hopkins Hall to bring to<br />\nlight the facts in regard to an article<br />\nin Monday's Evening Sun, which<br />\nblamed the lack of success of the<br />\nfootball team on lack of funds, fraternity rivalry and general mismanagement, and which stated that<br />\n\"H's\" would not be awarded this<br />\nyear. The article was signed by<br />\none \"A. E. H.\"<br />\nFreddie Lee opened the meeting<br />\nand called on Harry Burgan. The<br />\ngraduate manager first read the<br />\narticle above mentioned, and then<br />\na letter which stated the true facts<br />\naddressed to the sporting editor of<br />\nthe Evening Sui. and signed by<br />\neverybody in any way concerned.<br />\nThis letter absolutely denied that<br />\nCoach Harlan had asked for funds<br />\nand \"had been turned down cold,\"<br />\ndenied that any friction existed between Manager Ellicott and Graduate Manager Burgan, and denied<br />\nthat G. Pitts Raleigh had told some<br />\nmembers of the squad that their<br />\n\"H's\" would be withheld.<br />\nAssistant Coach Dick McCabe<br />\nthen spoke, praising the spirit of the<br />\nsquad and particularly of the scrubs,<br />\nand ending with an urgent appeal<br />\nfor backing from the side lines in<br />\nthe last game of the season, as the<br />\nteam had worked for and deserved<br />\nit.<br />\nCoach Fulton further emphasized<br />\nthe falsity of the article in the Sun,<br />\nadding that as large a squad had<br />\nbeen on the field every day as he<br />\nhad ever seen in previous years.<br />\nManager Ellicott denied that<br />\nthere was the least friction in the<br />\nmanagement, and added that if there<br />\nwere any, it would certainly be<br />\nknown and much talked of at the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nMr. C. L. Getz, the Hopkins reporter of the Evening Suit, explained how the article got into the<br />\npaper, disclaiming any connection<br />\nwith it, and saying that the sporting<br />\neditor had insisted on running it<br />\nwithout even showing it to him,<br />\nmuch against his advice and warning. He had since found that the<br />\narticle had been written by a regular staff reporter of the paper.<br />\nA motion was then made by Mr.<br />\nLeland, and unanimously carried,<br />\ncondemning the article in the Sun<br />\nand highly commending the team,<br />\nthe scrubs and the entire management for their work this year.<br />\n<br />\nThe Freshmen defeated t h e<br />\nSophomores 7 to o last Saturday in<br />\nthe annual struggle for gridiron<br />\nsupremacy between the two classes.<br />\nThe game was exciting from start<br />\nto finish, for the result was in doubt<br />\nat all times.<br />\nThe only score of the contest came<br />\nearly in the second quarter, when<br />\nCaptain George Penniman of the<br />\nFreshies carried the ball over the<br />\nline. The second year team was<br />\nnever dangerously near the Freshman goal line, while the younger<br />\nplayers kept the ball in striking distance of their opponents' goal most<br />\nof the time.<br />\nPenniman was easily the star of<br />\nthe game, being the chief groundgainer for the Freshman, and a<br />\ntower of strength in backing up the<br />\nline. Next to him, Woodward, at<br />\nright end, did the best work. He<br />\nfollowed the ball closely, and recovered three fumbles behind the<br />\nSophomore line. Little Johnny<br />\nKnipp also played well, and ran<br />\nback kicks for good gains.<br />\nThe particular star for the Sophs<br />\nwas Troxell, who was the only man<br />\nto gain consistently against the<br />\nstrong Freshman line. His work on<br />\nthe defensive left nothing to be desired, as he was in almost every<br />\nplay.<br />\nThe game was notable for the lack<br />\nof open plays, which the Freshmen<br />\ndid not risk, after they had the game<br />\nwon, and which the Sophs could not<br />\ncarry out on account of their line's<br />\ninability to hold long enough for<br />\nthem to be gotten off.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\n<br />\nVirginia Military Institute defeated Johns Hopkins- Thanksgiving Day on Homewood Field by the<br />\nscore of 21 to o in the last game of<br />\na season in which the. Black and<br />\nBlue has not won a contest.<br />\nThe 'Varsity did not expect to<br />\nWin, but it put up a \"Custer's Last<br />\nRally\" stand against the cadets,<br />\nmaking them fight for every gain.<br />\nAs if in defiance of the impudent<br />\ncriticism of the 'Varsity made in<br />\nlast Monday's Evening Sun, the<br />\nHopkins players put up one of the<br />\nmost spirited and snappy games of<br />\nthe season.<br />\nThe contest early turned into a<br />\nkicking contest; and Virginia gained<br />\non the exchanges, Fullback Moore<br />\nbeing a better punter than Bagley<br />\nof the Black and Blue. In justice<br />\nto Bagley, however, it must be<br />\nbrought out that he did not go into<br />\nthe contest expecting to be called<br />\nupon to punt after nearly every<br />\nother down. Captain Gillet was to<br />\nhave been Hopkins' punter this season, and after he was removed from<br />\nthe game it was too late to develop<br />\nanother to take his place. Bagley<br />\nand George Penniman starred in the<br />\nbackfield, and Vic Bridgman was<br />\nthe best player on the line. Bridgman made some fine tackles and recovered several fumbled balls.<br />\nThe Virginia players were older<br />\nand more experienced in the finer<br />\npoints of the game. Captain Moore<br />\nand Kingman shown above the other<br />\ncadets, and this pair not only rolled<br />\nup all 21 points, but they were in<br />\nevery play, both defensive and offensive. They have been playing for<br />\n_Virginia for three years. The elevens, however, were about even in<br />\nweight.<br />\nVirginia played a scrappy game,<br />\nhitting the line hard and tackling<br />\nalmost with a vengeance. The interference for Moore on end runs<br />\nwas good, but the backfield did not<br />\nattempt many plays through the<br />\n'Varsity line.<br />\nHopkins rooters turned out with<br />\na band and supported the team with<br />\ncheers and songs under the direction<br />\nof Butts Sutton until the last whistle<br />\nwas blown. Both team and student<br />\nbody closed the victoryless season<br />\nin a graceful and spirited manner.<br />\nVirginia did its scoring in the first,.<br />\nsecond and fourth quarters. La<br />\nMotte opened the game kicking to<br />\nCentre Patterson who advanced to<br />\nthe Hopkins 60-yard line. An incomplete pass was followed by a<br />\n15-yard throw from Moore to<br />\nLowery who went five yards more.<br />\n<br />\nThe Geology I Class is keeping up<br />\nits good work of \"getting close to<br />\nnature.\" Last Wednesday the class<br />\nmade a trip to Curtis Bay, where<br />\nancient river terraces were studied<br />\nand many interesting facts explained.

Dr.<br />\nJoseph S.

Hopkins has succeeded in losing nine<br />\nstraight games, without winning<br />\none. Such a record is truly a thing<br />\nof beauty, a rounded and symmetrical whole, which it would have been<br />\na real pity for us to spoil by happening, even just once, to win a game.<br />\nBut any danger of such a calamity is<br />\nnow past; the season is over, the<br />\nanxiety is ended, and our perfect<br />\nrecord of defeats has come forth<br />\nsaved. Post mortem examinations<br />\nof why we did not win are going<br />\non with their usual animation in the<br />\nbasement of McCoy Hall; and, of<br />\ncourse, everybody and everything,<br />\nfrom dea Fortuna and Coath Harlan down to the weather and the<br />\nschedule, is getting the blame.<br />\nInto such a post Dorton THE<br />\nNEws-LETTER does not propose to<br />\nenter here; but what it does want<br />\nto impress on everybody is that<br />\n\"snap judgment\" should not be<br />\nformed on an insufficient or distorted knowledge of the facts. An<br />\nexample of such \"snap judgment\"<br />\nwas the article which appeared in<br />\nlast Monday's issue of the Evening<br />\nSun. The impression which this<br />\narticle was calculated to produce<br />\nwas entirely erroneous and unfounded. Whatever faults may be laid at<br />\nthe door of the football team, petty<br />\npersonal jealousies and ungenerous<br />\nfraternity rivalries are not among<br />\nthem. The team may not have<br />\ntackled well, may not have punted<br />\nwell, may not have been able to<br />\ncatch forward passes, may not have<br />\nacted as a unit on the field; but one<br />\nthing that can be said of it with<br />\nabsolute certainty is that it was pervaded with a cordial and harmonious spirit of good fellowship. The<br />\narticle in the Evening Sun displayed<br />\na lamentable ignorance of actual<br />\n<br />\nconditions, and it is to be hoped that<br />\nthe reply published by Messrs. Burroughs, Stone, et al., in Wednesday's issue of the same paper successfully corrected any misconceptions which the former article might<br />\nhave created.<br />\nWhatever may have been the<br />\ncause of Hopkins' unbroken series<br />\nof defeats this year\u2014and it cannot<br />\nbe denied that Hick had much to do<br />\nwith them\u2014we should not be pessimistic. This year, with a raw team<br />\nand a coach new to Hopkins conditions,, an unsuccessful season might<br />\nhave been .expected. Next year it<br />\nlooks as if matters will stand differently. Only two members of this<br />\nyear's team\u2014Captain Gillet, whose<br />\ninjury prevented his playing during<br />\nthe greater part of the season, and<br />\nthe efficient Dollinger, who appeared<br />\n\u2022 in only two games\u2014will be removed<br />\nby graduation. With a whole year's<br />\nexperience behind it, our present<br />\nteam ought to go into the field next<br />\nfall greatly improved. Now that<br />\nthe technical department has been<br />\nopened, it may be predicted that<br />\nthe freshman class will be unusually large and will afford considerable good football material. By insistence upon regular attendance at<br />\npractices, Coach Harlan has been<br />\nsteadily improving the discipline of<br />\nthe team, and, if he returns next<br />\nyear, he will know the needs of Hopkins football as no coach in his first<br />\nyear's residence can possibly know<br />\nthem. All these things taken together ought to tell for a season<br />\n\u2022which will be at least more successful than the past one has been.<br />\nwe ought not to be discouraged. It is well for us to remember<br />\nat all times, but now in particular,<br />\nthat the reputation of a college does<br />\nnot, or at least should not, stand<br />\non football. It is a splendid thing<br />\nfor us to have a winning football<br />\nteam: it is unfortunate that we have<br />\nhad so unsuccessful a season, and it<br />\nis to be hoped that we shall retrieve<br />\nourselves next year; but if we.<br />\njudge ourselves by football, we shall<br />\ncome out at the small end of the<br />\nhorn, indeed.

But in other ways it has<br />\nproved a benefit in disguise. But<br />\nsome disguises, like practical jokes,<br />\nmay not always seem funny or<br />\nclever.<br />\nBut on all college teams there<br />\ncomes some year when graduation<br />\nruins the teatn of the following<br />\nyear. This was just our case. We<br />\nstarted out with two men who had<br />\nplayed on the team one year, two<br />\nwho had played two years, and only<br />\none who had played three years.<br />\nEven these men had not been regulars all their respective years of<br />\n<br />\nplaying. Later several more men<br />\ncame out who had been subs. About<br />\nthese men a team had to be built.<br />\nAs our season started so late we had<br />\nto go ahead and play games before<br />\nthe new and inexperienced men had<br />\nbeen fully drilled. Besides football<br />\nhas to be born in \u2014a player or else<br />\nlearned, by experience. Unfortunately, knowledge of football did<br />\nnot seem to have been born in many<br />\nof our crew.<br />\nBut one of the ways in which we<br />\nwere benefited was the opportunity<br />\ngiven the undergraduates to learn<br />\nat first hand. In a year or two the<br />\nteam will be a wonder. I only hope<br />\nthat this season will not influence<br />\nthe future manager towards easing<br />\nup the schedule. I believe there is<br />\nno necessity for such action.<br />\nAlso, I want to thank all the students for the way in which they<br />\nhave backed us up this fall and particularly all who came out to practice and gave us the largest squad<br />\nthat there ever has been there.<br />\nThanking you, I am<br />\nVery sincerely,<br />\nGEORGE M.

The\u2022first letter was evidently<br />\nwritten by a fellow, not by a girl,<br />\nwhether the second one was written<br />\nby a fair co-ed, or not. The writer<br />\nof the first letter is evidently a<br />\nfreshman, or, if an upperclassman,<br />\none who knows nothing about girls.<br />\n\u2022Probably, he has made a specialty of<br />\nold maids; for in his letter he has<br />\nthe supposed girl say that she wants<br />\nto walk up and down the halls arm<br />\nin arm with the fellows. Everybody knows that it is the old maid<br />\nnot the fair maiden who is forced<br />\nto make such unblushing suggestions. They are forced like Diogenes ever to be on the look-out for<br />\nhonest men. The young ,ladies<br />\ndon't have to. Flowers don't have<br />\nto go in search of bees.<br />\nI wish to acknowledge from the<br />\nvery start that I am a bee in search<br />\nof f- lowers, and will not pretend I<br />\nam a flower in search of bees. What<br />\nI am interested in is how to induce<br />\nflowers to turn their heads my way.<br />\nThere was a fine suggestion in Life<br />\nthe other day, which had been made<br />\nby a professor in the University of<br />\nPennsylvania. He said that college students should be encouraged<br />\nto write love letters to help them in<br />\ntheir English literature courses. He<br />\nclaimed that just as birds learn to<br />\nsing exquisitely from the practice<br />\nthey have gotten in singing to their<br />\nmates, so college students would<br />\nlearn to write beautifully if they<br />\nwere encouraged to write to their<br />\nsweethearts. When I had read this I<br />\nthrew down the Life on the Y. M.<br />\nC. A. table at which I had been<br />\nreading and went rushing up to Dr.<br />\nGreene's room to tell him that I<br />\nwould be willing to write a love<br />\nletter to any girl he might select, if<br />\nhe would excuse me from the lesson in the Prologue, which he had<br />\nassigned for Monday. But when<br />\nhalf way up the stairs, I recollected<br />\nthat the blooming Pennsylvania professor had said that the letter should<br />\nbe supervised before being sent to<br />\ntheir destination. I was willing to<br />\nlet him select the girl I was to write<br />\nto, as I felt sure he must know a lot<br />\nof lovely ones, but I didn't know if<br />\nI would care to have him go oyer<br />\nthe letters I had written. He might<br />\nmake me put some Chaucer in them.<br />\nBut, then, I thought, parts of Chaucer are darn good stuff to put in a<br />\nlove letter.

The letters are<br />\nawarded by the General Athletic Association, which has not yet met for this<br />\npurpose. There has been no movement<br />\nto prevent the usual awarding of the<br />\n\"H\"s, and certainly no reason for stating that they will not be awarded;- nor<br />\ndid Mr. Raleigh, at any time, so state<br />\nto any member of the team.<br />\nCoach Harlan is represented as being<br />\nready to \"throw up the sponge\" on many<br />\noccasions. This is untrue, and is a gross<br />\ninjustice to the loyalty and sportsmanship of a coach who has been formally<br />\nnotified that his work is highly satisfactory.<br />\nThe entire description of the alleged<br />\naction of G. Pitts Raleigh is false, both<br />\nas to time, place and substance of his<br />\nsupposed interviews with players.<br />\nThe intimation that fraternity rivalries<br />\nare responsible for the \"smash-up of the<br />\nteam,\" not only has no foundation in<br />\nfact, but lacks even the appearance of<br />\ntruth. As evidence of this, Raleigh,<br />\nBridgeman and La Motte, represented as<br />\nbeing at odds, are all members of the<br />\nsame fraternity.<br />\nThe statement that funds for equipment were lacking, and that Coach Harlan's requests for apparatus were \"turned<br />\ndown cold,\" are totally untrue. .<br />\nThe, utterly inaccurate nature of the.<br />\narticle is seen in the attempt to fasten<br />\ncriticism for the playing schedule on<br />\nHarry Burgan. Mr. Burgan had absolutely no connection with the football<br />\nmanagement until many months after<br />\nthe schedule was fixed.<br />\n,The article concludes with the intimation that while bad luck has played some<br />\npart in the defeats of the team, that dissensions, mismanagements and petty politics are really at fault. We do not<br />\ncare to hide behind \"hard luck.\" There<br />\nare a number of definite causes why<br />\ngames were lost, chief of which is the<br />\nscarcity and inexperience of'football material. But losing games does not necessarily mean a totally disastrous season.<br />\n. One of the best achievements of the<br />\nyear has been the solidarity and faithfulness of the football squad as a whole,<br />\nand the hearty support of the student<br />\nbody as evidenced upon such occasions<br />\nas the St. John's game.<br />\nWe trust that your usual fairminded<br />\nattitude toward Hopkins athletics will<br />\nsecure this' letter a prominent place in<br />\nyour columns.<br />\nHORACE BURROUGHS,<br />\nHARVEY B.

All<br />\nof this loss was made up by the Baltimore concerts, but this meant less<br />\nmoney for the Hullaboloos, which<br />\nare considerably in need of such<br />\nsupport. Besides this, the transportation facilities of the Eastern<br />\nShore are such as to require long<br />\nrailroad trips to cover relatively<br />\nshort distances. With the additional<br />\nidea that \"we have worn out our<br />\nwelcome,\" it seems eminently desirable to give this section of the<br />\nState time to recover.<br />\nFrederick, Hagerstown and Cumberland seem suitable places to give<br />\nconcerts, though the question of<br />\nmaking railroad connections remains to be considered. With<br />\nChristmas coming on Wednesday,<br />\nthe Clubs will probably leave the<br />\nnext day and give concerts on<br />\nThursday, Friday and Saturday<br />\nnights. -Jack Fulton, who has taken<br />\nover the work of training the Glee<br />\nClub and arranging the trips, has not<br />\nannounced anything definite as yet.<br />\nFollowing the football mass-meeting, last Wednesday, a very successful rehearsal of the Glee Club was<br />\nheld. It was decided to have rehearsals for the tenors on Mondays<br />\nat one o'clock, and for the bassos on<br />\nWednesdays, at the same hour. A<br />\ngen&amp;al rehearsal will take place on<br />\nFridays. Fulton has requested any<br />\none knowing persons in Frederick,<br />\nHagerstown or Cumberland to giyie<br />\nhis name to him in order.to increase<br />\nthe list of patrons.<br /><br />\nOn Wednesaay last, a mass-meeting of the entire student body was<br />\nheld in Hopkins Hall to bring to<br />\nlight the facts in regard to an article<br />\nin Monday's Evening Sun, which<br />\nblamed the lack of success of the<br />\nfootball team on lack of funds, fraternity rivalry and general mismanagement, and which stated that<br />\n\"H's\" would not be awarded this<br />\nyear. The article was signed by<br />\none \"A. E. H.\"<br />\nFreddie Lee opened the meeting<br />\nand called on Harry Burgan. The<br />\ngraduate manager first read the<br />\narticle above mentioned, and then<br />\na letter which stated the true facts<br />\naddressed to the sporting editor of<br />\nthe Evening Sui. and signed by<br />\neverybody in any way concerned.<br />\nThis letter absolutely denied that<br />\nCoach Harlan had asked for funds<br />\nand \"had been turned down cold,\"<br />\ndenied that any friction existed between Manager Ellicott and Graduate Manager Burgan, and denied<br />\nthat G. Pitts Raleigh had told some<br />\nmembers of the squad that their<br />\n\"H's\" would be withheld.<br />\nAssistant Coach Dick McCabe<br />\nthen spoke, praising the spirit of the<br />\nsquad and particularly of the scrubs,<br />\nand ending with an urgent appeal<br />\nfor backing from the side lines in<br />\nthe last game of the season, as the<br />\nteam had worked for and deserved<br />\nit.<br />\nCoach Fulton further emphasized<br />\nthe falsity of the article in the Sun,<br />\nadding that as large a squad had<br />\nbeen on the field every day as he<br />\nhad ever seen in previous years.<br />\nManager Ellicott denied that<br />\nthere was the least friction in the<br />\nmanagement, and added that if there<br />\nwere any, it would certainly be<br />\nknown and much talked of at the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nMr. C. L. Getz, the Hopkins reporter of the Evening Suit, explained how the article got into the<br />\npaper, disclaiming any connection<br />\nwith it, and saying that the sporting<br />\neditor had insisted on running it<br />\nwithout even showing it to him,<br />\nmuch against his advice and warning. He had since found that the<br />\narticle had been written by a regular staff reporter of the paper.<br />\nA motion was then made by Mr.<br />\nLeland, and unanimously carried,<br />\ncondemning the article in the Sun<br />\nand highly commending the team,<br />\nthe scrubs and the entire management for their work this year.<br /><br />\nThe Freshmen defeated t h e<br />\nSophomores 7 to o last Saturday in<br />\nthe annual struggle for gridiron<br />\nsupremacy between the two classes.<br />\nThe game was exciting from start<br />\nto finish, for the result was in doubt<br />\nat all times.<br />\nThe only score of the contest came<br />\nearly in the second quarter, when<br />\nCaptain George Penniman of the<br />\nFreshies carried the ball over the<br />\nline. The second year team was<br />\nnever dangerously near the Freshman goal line, while the younger<br />\nplayers kept the ball in striking distance of their opponents' goal most<br />\nof the time.<br />\nPenniman was easily the star of<br />\nthe game, being the chief groundgainer for the Freshman, and a<br />\ntower of strength in backing up the<br />\nline. Next to him, Woodward, at<br />\nright end, did the best work. He<br />\nfollowed the ball closely, and recovered three fumbles behind the<br />\nSophomore line. Little Johnny<br />\nKnipp also played well, and ran<br />\nback kicks for good gains.<br />\nThe particular star for the Sophs<br />\nwas Troxell, who was the only man<br />\nto gain consistently against the<br />\nstrong Freshman line. His work on<br />\nthe defensive left nothing to be desired, as he was in almost every<br />\nplay.<br />\nThe game was notable for the lack<br />\nof open plays, which the Freshmen<br />\ndid not risk, after they had the game<br />\nwon, and which the Sophs could not<br />\ncarry out on account of their line's<br />\ninability to hold long enough for<br />\nthem to be gotten off.<br />\nThe line-up:<br /><br />\nVirginia Military Institute defeated Johns Hopkins- Thanksgiving Day on Homewood Field by the<br />\nscore of 21 to o in the last game of<br />\na season in which the. Black and<br />\nBlue has not won a contest.<br />\nThe 'Varsity did not expect to<br />\nWin, but it put up a \"Custer's Last<br />\nRally\" stand against the cadets,<br />\nmaking them fight for every gain.<br />\nAs if in defiance of the impudent<br />\ncriticism of the 'Varsity made in<br />\nlast Monday's Evening Sun, the<br />\nHopkins players put up one of the<br />\nmost spirited and snappy games of<br />\nthe season.<br />\nThe contest early turned into a<br />\nkicking contest; and Virginia gained<br />\non the exchanges, Fullback Moore<br />\nbeing a better punter than Bagley<br />\nof the Black and Blue. In justice<br />\nto Bagley, however, it must be<br />\nbrought out that he did not go into<br />\nthe contest expecting to be called<br />\nupon to punt after nearly every<br />\nother down. Captain Gillet was to<br />\nhave been Hopkins' punter this season, and after he was removed from<br />\nthe game it was too late to develop<br />\nanother to take his place. Bagley<br />\nand George Penniman starred in the<br />\nbackfield, and Vic Bridgman was<br />\nthe best player on the line. Bridgman made some fine tackles and recovered several fumbled balls.<br />\nThe Virginia players were older<br />\nand more experienced in the finer<br />\npoints of the game. Captain Moore<br />\nand Kingman shown above the other<br />\ncadets, and this pair not only rolled<br />\nup all 21 points, but they were in<br />\nevery play, both defensive and offensive. They have been playing for<br />\n_Virginia for three years. The elevens, however, were about even in<br />\nweight.<br />\nVirginia played a scrappy game,<br />\nhitting the line hard and tackling<br />\nalmost with a vengeance. The interference for Moore on end runs<br />\nwas good, but the backfield did not<br />\nattempt many plays through the<br />\n'Varsity line.<br />\nHopkins rooters turned out with<br />\na band and supported the team with<br />\ncheers and songs under the direction<br />\nof Butts Sutton until the last whistle<br />\nwas blown. Both team and student<br />\nbody closed the victoryless season<br />\nin a graceful and spirited manner.<br />\nVirginia did its scoring in the first,.<br />\nsecond and fourth quarters. La<br />\nMotte opened the game kicking to<br />\nCentre Patterson who advanced to<br />\nthe Hopkins 60-yard line. An incomplete pass was followed by a<br />\n15-yard throw from Moore to<br />\nLowery who went five yards more.<br /><br />\nThe Geology I Class is keeping up<br />\nits good work of \"getting close to<br />\nnature.\" Last Wednesday the class<br />\nmade a trip to Curtis Bay, where<br />\nancient river terraces were studied<br />\nand many interesting facts explained.

Hopkins has succeeded in losing nine<br />\nstraight games, without winning<br />\none. Such a record is truly a thing<br />\nof beauty, a rounded and symmetrical whole, which it would have been<br />\na real pity for us to spoil by happening, even just once, to win a game.<br />\nBut any danger of such a calamity is<br />\nnow past; the season is over, the<br />\nanxiety is ended, and our perfect<br />\nrecord of defeats has come forth<br />\nsaved. Post mortem examinations<br />\nof why we did not win are going<br />\non with their usual animation in the<br />\nbasement of McCoy Hall; and, of<br />\ncourse, everybody and everything,<br />\nfrom dea Fortuna and Coath Harlan down to the weather and the<br />\nschedule, is getting the blame.<br />\nInto such a post Dorton THE<br />\nNEws-LETTER does not propose to<br />\nenter here; but what it does want<br />\nto impress on everybody is that<br />\n\"snap judgment\" should not be<br />\nformed on an insufficient or distorted knowledge of the facts. An<br />\nexample of such \"snap judgment\"<br />\nwas the article which appeared in<br />\nlast Monday's issue of the Evening<br />\nSun. The impression which this<br />\narticle was calculated to produce<br />\nwas entirely erroneous and unfounded. Whatever faults may be laid at<br />\nthe door of the football team, petty<br />\npersonal jealousies and ungenerous<br />\nfraternity rivalries are not among<br />\nthem. The team may not have<br />\ntackled well, may not have punted<br />\nwell, may not have been able to<br />\ncatch forward passes, may not have<br />\nacted as a unit on the field; but one<br />\nthing that can be said of it with<br />\nabsolute certainty is that it was pervaded with a cordial and harmonious spirit of good fellowship. The<br />\narticle in the Evening Sun displayed<br />\na lamentable ignorance of actual<br /><br />\nconditions, and it is to be hoped that<br />\nthe reply published by Messrs. Burroughs, Stone, et al., in Wednesday's issue of the same paper successfully corrected any misconceptions which the former article might<br />\nhave created.<br />\nWhatever may have been the<br />\ncause of Hopkins' unbroken series<br />\nof defeats this year\u2014and it cannot<br />\nbe denied that Hick had much to do<br />\nwith them\u2014we should not be pessimistic. This year, with a raw team<br />\nand a coach new to Hopkins conditions,, an unsuccessful season might<br />\nhave been .expected. Next year it<br />\nlooks as if matters will stand differently. Only two members of this<br />\nyear's team\u2014Captain Gillet, whose<br />\ninjury prevented his playing during<br />\nthe greater part of the season, and<br />\nthe efficient Dollinger, who appeared<br />\n\u2022 in only two games\u2014will be removed<br />\nby graduation. With a whole year's<br />\nexperience behind it, our present<br />\nteam ought to go into the field next<br />\nfall greatly improved. Now that<br />\nthe technical department has been<br />\nopened, it may be predicted that<br />\nthe freshman class will be unusually large and will afford considerable good football material. By insistence upon regular attendance at<br />\npractices, Coach Harlan has been<br />\nsteadily improving the discipline of<br />\nthe team, and, if he returns next<br />\nyear, he will know the needs of Hopkins football as no coach in his first<br />\nyear's residence can possibly know<br />\nthem. All these things taken together ought to tell for a season<br />\n\u2022which will be at least more successful than the past one has been.<br />\nwe ought not to be discouraged. It is well for us to remember<br />\nat all times, but now in particular,<br />\nthat the reputation of a college does<br />\nnot, or at least should not, stand<br />\non football. It is a splendid thing<br />\nfor us to have a winning football<br />\nteam: it is unfortunate that we have<br />\nhad so unsuccessful a season, and it<br />\nis to be hoped that we shall retrieve<br />\nourselves next year; but if we.<br />\njudge ourselves by football, we shall<br />\ncome out at the small end of the<br />\nhorn, indeed.

But in other ways it has<br />\nproved a benefit in disguise. But<br />\nsome disguises, like practical jokes,<br />\nmay not always seem funny or<br />\nclever.<br />\nBut on all college teams there<br />\ncomes some year when graduation<br />\nruins the teatn of the following<br />\nyear. This was just our case. We<br />\nstarted out with two men who had<br />\nplayed on the team one year, two<br />\nwho had played two years, and only<br />\none who had played three years.<br />\nEven these men had not been regulars all their respective years of<br /><br />\nplaying. Later several more men<br />\ncame out who had been subs. About<br />\nthese men a team had to be built.<br />\nAs our season started so late we had<br />\nto go ahead and play games before<br />\nthe new and inexperienced men had<br />\nbeen fully drilled. Besides football<br />\nhas to be born in \u2014a player or else<br />\nlearned, by experience. Unfortunately, knowledge of football did<br />\nnot seem to have been born in many<br />\nof our crew.<br />\nBut one of the ways in which we<br />\nwere benefited was the opportunity<br />\ngiven the undergraduates to learn<br />\nat first hand. In a year or two the<br />\nteam will be a wonder. I only hope<br />\nthat this season will not influence<br />\nthe future manager towards easing<br />\nup the schedule. I believe there is<br />\nno necessity for such action.<br />\nAlso, I want to thank all the students for the way in which they<br />\nhave backed us up this fall and particularly all who came out to practice and gave us the largest squad<br />\nthat there ever has been there.<br />\nThanking you, I am<br />\nVery sincerely,<br />\nGEORGE M.

The\u2022first letter was evidently<br />\nwritten by a fellow, not by a girl,<br />\nwhether the second one was written<br />\nby a fair co-ed, or not. The writer<br />\nof the first letter is evidently a<br />\nfreshman, or, if an upperclassman,<br />\none who knows nothing about girls.<br />\n\u2022Probably, he has made a specialty of<br />\nold maids; for in his letter he has<br />\nthe supposed girl say that she wants<br />\nto walk up and down the halls arm<br />\nin arm with the fellows. Everybody knows that it is the old maid<br />\nnot the fair maiden who is forced<br />\nto make such unblushing suggestions. They are forced like Diogenes ever to be on the look-out for<br />\nhonest men. The young ,ladies<br />\ndon't have to. Flowers don't have<br />\nto go in search of bees.<br />\nI wish to acknowledge from the<br />\nvery start that I am a bee in search<br />\nof f- lowers, and will not pretend I<br />\nam a flower in search of bees. What<br />\nI am interested in is how to induce<br />\nflowers to turn their heads my way.<br />\nThere was a fine suggestion in Life<br />\nthe other day, which had been made<br />\nby a professor in the University of<br />\nPennsylvania. He said that college students should be encouraged<br />\nto write love letters to help them in<br />\ntheir English literature courses. He<br />\nclaimed that just as birds learn to<br />\nsing exquisitely from the practice<br />\nthey have gotten in singing to their<br />\nmates, so college students would<br />\nlearn to write beautifully if they<br />\nwere encouraged to write to their<br />\nsweethearts. When I had read this I<br />\nthrew down the Life on the Y. M.<br />\nC. A. table at which I had been<br />\nreading and went rushing up to Dr.<br />\nGreene's room to tell him that I<br />\nwould be willing to write a love<br />\nletter to any girl he might select, if<br />\nhe would excuse me from the lesson in the Prologue, which he had<br />\nassigned for Monday. But when<br />\nhalf way up the stairs, I recollected<br />\nthat the blooming Pennsylvania professor had said that the letter should<br />\nbe supervised before being sent to<br />\ntheir destination. I was willing to<br />\nlet him select the girl I was to write<br />\nto, as I felt sure he must know a lot<br />\nof lovely ones, but I didn't know if<br />\nI would care to have him go oyer<br />\nthe letters I had written. He might<br />\nmake me put some Chaucer in them.<br />\nBut, then, I thought, parts of Chaucer are darn good stuff to put in a<br />\nlove letter.

Sun:<br />\nDear Sir\u2014An article appearing in The<br />\nEvening Sun of Monday, November 25,<br />\nrelating to football affairs at Hopkins,<br />\nis full of errors injurious to the institution and to individuals, and we ask<br />\nthe courtesy of a place on your page for<br />\nthis letter, signed by all the men especially interested in the article.<br /><br />\nThe- following categorical denials of<br />\nstatements or intimations in said article<br />\nare made without fear of contradiction:<br />\nIn headlines and in the body of the<br />\nstory an assertion appears that the \"H\"<br />\nwill not be,given to the players this<br />\nyear, Bridgenan and La Motte especially being. mentioned. The letters are<br />\nawarded by the General Athletic Association, which has not yet met for this<br />\npurpose. There has been no movement<br />\nto prevent the usual awarding of the<br />\n\"H\"s, and certainly no reason for stating that they will not be awarded;- nor<br />\ndid Mr. Raleigh, at any time, so state<br />\nto any member of the team.<br />\nCoach Harlan is represented as being<br />\nready to \"throw up the sponge\" on many<br />\noccasions. This is untrue, and is a gross<br />\ninjustice to the loyalty and sportsmanship of a coach who has been formally<br />\nnotified that his work is highly satisfactory.<br />\nThe entire description of the alleged<br />\naction of G. Pitts Raleigh is false, both<br />\nas to time, place and substance of his<br />\nsupposed interviews with players.<br />\nThe intimation that fraternity rivalries<br />\nare responsible for the \"smash-up of the<br />\nteam,\" not only has no foundation in<br />\nfact, but lacks even the appearance of<br />\ntruth. As evidence of this, Raleigh,<br />\nBridgeman and La Motte, represented as<br />\nbeing at odds, are all members of the<br />\nsame fraternity.<br />\nThe statement that funds for equipment were lacking, and that Coach Harlan's requests for apparatus were \"turned<br />\ndown cold,\" are totally untrue. .<br />\nThe, utterly inaccurate nature of the.<br />\narticle is seen in the attempt to fasten<br />\ncriticism for the playing schedule on<br />\nHarry Burgan. Mr. Burgan had absolutely no connection with the football<br />\nmanagement until many months after<br />\nthe schedule was fixed.<br />\n,The article concludes with the intimation that while bad luck has played some<br />\npart in the defeats of the team, that dissensions, mismanagements and petty politics are really at fault. We do not<br />\ncare to hide behind \"hard luck.\" There<br />\nare a number of definite causes why<br />\ngames were lost, chief of which is the<br />\nscarcity and inexperience of'football material. But losing games does not necessarily mean a totally disastrous season.<br />\n. One of the best achievements of the<br />\nyear has been the solidarity and faithfulness of the football squad as a whole,<br />\nand the hearty support of the student<br />\nbody as evidenced upon such occasions<br />\nas the St. John's game.<br />\nWe trust that your usual fairminded<br />\nattitude toward Hopkins athletics will<br />\nsecure this' letter a prominent place in<br />\nyour columns.<br />\nHORACE BURROUGHS,<br />\nHARVEY B.
