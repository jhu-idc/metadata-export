He has fulfilled all but a<br />\nfew of the requirements for medical<br />\nschool, he says, and is at present<br />\ntaking English writing, chemistry,<br />\nand mathematics.<br />\nHe wants to be able to enter the<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine in the<br />\nfall of 1935. That will be the realization of a childhood dream for as<br />\nlong ago as he can remember Juan<br />\nRicardo Martinez has wanted to<br />\ncome to Baltimore to study medicine<br />\nat the institution which, in his own<br />\nnative country, he says, is recognized as the world's greatest medical center.<br />\n<br />\ngovernment, is based almost exactly<br />\nupon the French Elysee plan.<br />\nFrench professors are to be found<br />\nto a great degree, too, in the Argentine universities, he said.<br />\nIn commenting on the differences<br />\nbetween American and South American students the Peruvian consul<br />\nsmilingly said: \"The students are<br />\nmore organized in America\u2014and it<br />\nshould be that way. But in South<br />\nAmerica, where the students actually govern the universities, there<br />\nare many factions which are brought<br />\nabout by differences in political<br />\nopinions.\" Of course, he agreed<br />\nwith the interviewer, undergraduates should have the right to think<br />\nas they wish, to express their own<br />\nopinions on political affairs, but<br />\nthese differences in opinions should<br />\nnot disrupt the organized student<br />\nbody.<br />\nChoose Own Teachers<br />\n<br />\nMr. Martinez claims that Argentina, of all the South American<br />\ncountries, is far more advanced educationally. He pointed out that<br />\nthe higher education system, which<br />\nis exclusively maintained by the<br />\n<br />\nAmerican students aren't as<br />\nlucky as those in Argentina for, as<br />\nMr. Martinez pointed out, the students in the South American country by popular vote select professors proposed for the faculty by the<br />\ndean.

He holds the record at that stronghold of knowledge for being the youngest graduate,<br />\nfor he was only seventeen when he received his first<br />\ndegree. From 1898 until 1901 he was a fellow in<br />\nGreek and then went abroad for two years. He received his Ph.D. in 1904.<br />\nHE HAS taught a variety of subjects, including<br />\nGreek and Latin, as well as the history of the Greek<br />\nand Romans. Even now, while he is known for his<br />\npopular history of art course, he is teaching Greek<br />\nliterature. He is an indefatigable worker, and besides teaching, running expeditions, and lecturing, he<br />\nhas written a number of books, including several<br />\ntranslations. To date he has published sixteen volumes. He has published a series of books, now in<br />\nits eighth volume, concerning the excavations at<br />\nOlynthus.
