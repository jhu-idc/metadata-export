If there were other<br />\nmeeting places on campus\u2014places providing<br />\na similar atmosphere to the Hut\u2014students<br />\nmost likely wouldn't complain because there<br />\nwould be other places to hang out.

But only a certain few care about<br />\nsome place where people can pull all-nighters<br />\nand read magazines. They don't realize that<br />\nthere are things far more important than<br />\nHutian activities.<br />\nStudents have to do more. Hopkins isn't<br />\na single issue campus. And they simply can't<br />\ndepend upon Student Council to accomplish<br />\nanything. So the only alternative is for<br />\nstudents to voice their opinions on other<br />\nissues; students must stop complaining<br />\namong themselves because whenever it<br />\ncomes down to doing anything, they always<br />\nsay, \"I can't. I have other things to do.\"<br />\nCareerism is the problem at Hopkins.<br />\nEveryone's more concerned with what they'll<br />\nbe doing after graduation than with what<br />\nthey're doing now.

They're<br />\nlaughing at us.<br />\nSo what's it gonna be? Will we complain<br />\nabout the Hopkins social life? Will we complain about the placement office that<br />\nprimarily caters to engineers?

Even<br />\nif my assailants had not forced<br />\nme to keep quiet, I believe it is<br />\nhighly unlikely anyone would<br />\nhave heard me. My assailants<br />\ninitally threatened me with<br />\nrape, but then first demanded<br />\nto know if I had any money.<br />\nSecurity tells me how lucky I<br />\nwas; true, I was unhurt, but I<br />\nlost $100.00.

I will<br />\nnot, and I have not, but out of<br />\ncuriousity I read it before sending it to my parents. Officer<br />\nKraft's reasoning was that \"it<br />\ncontains bad language\"and it<br />\nshould, the whole incident last<br />\nnight was foul. I was chagrined to find my actions in the in-<br />\n<br />\ncident misrepresented. After<br />\nreading the report, I learned<br />\nthat I had been grabbed from<br />\nbehind, by one assailant, while<br />\nconfronted by another (true),<br />\nand that I had responded by<br />\npleading with them to leave me<br />\nalone and offering them my<br />\nmoney (FALSE). I let them<br />\ntake my money, yes, hoping to<br />\nsatisfy them from taking<br />\nanything else or from harming<br />\nme. I happened to run from<br />\nthem just afterwards, leaving<br />\nthem laughing. Only because<br />\nthe one behind me loosened his<br />\ngrip on me (and I didn't stick<br />\naround to find out if they were<br />\ndangerously armed).<br />\nI am fully aware of the<br />\nUniversity's taboo on publicizing security trouble on campus.<br />\nI in no way respect it. I believe<br />\nthat had I been more cognizant<br />\nof the danger of walking 500<br />\nyards alone, in a place that I<br />\ncall home, I would have been<br />\nmore careful.<br />\nIn the past month, there have<br />\nbeen a rash of incidents similar<br />\nto mine around campus. Most<br />\nstudents on campus, however,<br />\nare ignorant of this because of<br />\nthe University \"hush-hush\"<br />\npolicy. The danger in this ignorance is further augmented<br />\nbecause the University perceives<br />\nits security jurisdiction to be encompassed by campus property. I venture to disagree: 2680<br />\nHopkins-Homewood students,<br />\nlive, at the very least, a block<br />\nfrom campus.<br />\nI understand the JHU Security has but two patrol cars. I am<br />\nappreciative of the fact that<br />\nafter my mugging last night<br />\nboth cars, and BCPD, scouted<br />\nfor my assailants. However,<br />\nwith a $1,000 tuition hike<br />\nscheduled for next semester,<br />\nand 620 plus incoming<br />\nstudents, why can't Security<br />\noperate as it does for special<br />\nevents, posting officers at accessible points on campus at all<br />\ntimes? I regard the size of this<br />\nUniversity to be an asset to such<br />\na proposal; three to four men<br />\ncould make this Campus<br />\nSAFE.

Rather, the passage is<br />\nin reference to the people of<br />\nSodom and Gomorrah: \"These<br />\nmen are grumblers and<br />\nfaultfinders; they follow their<br />\nown evil desires; they boast<br />\nabout themselves and flatter<br />\nothers for their own advantage.\" Therefore, claiming<br />\nJude 6-16 is the \"shameful<br />\nresult\" of feminism is a non<br />\nsequitur.<br />\nAlso, John 2:4, in which<br />\nJesus states,\"'Dear woman,<br />\nwhy do you involve me?...My<br />\ntime has not yet come.' \", is<br />\n\"striving<br />\nagainst<br />\nnot<br />\nfeminism\", but referring to doing God's will as in Mark 3:35,<br />\n<br />\nmother' \". As for Eve \"conning\" Adam, the serpent deceived Eve, who took some fruit<br />\nand ate it, and then \"gave some<br />\nto her husband, who was with<br />\nher, and he ate it.\" (Genesis<br />\n3:6) They both ate by their own<br />\nfree wills.<br />\nIn addition, the New Testament does not describe Jesus'<br />\n\"prosecution by the feminist<br />\nrulers of the world\", as<br />\nJohnson states, because there is<br />\nno mention of any such avantgarde societies in the Bible. As<br />\nwell, claiming that \"our society is facing nuclear annihilation\" because \"the influence of<br />\nwoman upon man has<br />\nseparated him from God\" is a<br />\ngalling attempt to use women as<br />\nscapegoats through scare tactics, much as the Jews were<br />\nblamed by the Nazis for Germany's woes prior to and during WWII. The New Testament<br />\neradicates the separation of<br />\npeople from God (Ephesiang<br />\n2:11-22, John 3:16-18) and the<br />\ncurrent cold war is a result of<br />\ntwo superpowers' foreign<br />\npolicies, not the existence of<br />\nwomen. Therefore, Johnson's<br />\nreference to Jesus' \"path of<br />\npersecution in resisting<br />\nfeminism\" is unfounded.<br />\nJ.

Lee, being performed by the Vagabond Players in<br />\n\u2022Fell's Point through March 4.<br />\nThis Thoreau, played blandly<br />\nby Marc Nohe, is opinionated,<br />\ncantankerous, rude, and<br />\ndisagreeable. The real Thoreau<br />\nprobably had these qualities as<br />\nwell, but this Thoreau is also<br />\nstupid, self-righteous, wholly<br />\nlacking compassion and any<br />\nemotion except self-pity; the<br />\nreal Thoreau certainly was not.<br />\nThe play is ostensibly about<br />\none night in 1846 when<br />\nThoreau, who refused to pay<br />\nhis taxes on the grounds that a<br />\nportion of the money would go<br />\nto supporting the war in Mexico, was thrown in the Concord<br />\n(Massachusetts) jail. As one<br />\nmight guess, not a lot happens<br />\nin the one night before someone<br />\n(in the play, his aunt) pays his<br />\ntaxes and has him set free, certainly not enough for a threehour play. The play is padded<br />\nwith snippets supposedly from<br />\nThoreau's life.<br />\nThe depiction of Thoreau<br />\nseems entirely wrong. He's such<br />\n<br />\nMarc Nohe as Henry Thoreau talks to Fred Kennan, his jailmate.<br />\n<br />\na fanatic and so unthinkingly<br />\nso, it is hard to imagine an intellectual like Emerson (here<br />\nplayed aptly if stiffly by Bruce<br />\nGodfrey) having any respect for<br />\nhim at all, or for that matter,<br />\nthis hotheaded Thoreau failing<br />\nto despise the discursive Emerson. In life, Thoreau seemed<br />\nthoughtful and deliberate; apparently Lawrence and Lee<br />\ndidn't find him dramatic<br />\n<br />\nenough, so they rewrote him as<br />\na kind of left-wing version of<br />\nWilliam Jennings Bryant who<br />\nleaps up like a Jack-in-the-Box<br />\nat each new opportunity to talk<br />\nand thereby to make himself<br />\nlook silly. He incessantly<br />\npatronizes his cellmate, Bailey<br />\n(Fred Kernan)treating him like<br />\nan idiot because he is illiterate;<br />\nhe taunts Lydia Emerson<br />\n(Fredericka Courpas)about her<br />\n<br />\nPress Photo<br />\n<br />\nsexual frustration; when his<br />\nbrother John (David Keltz)dies<br />\nof tetanus, he tortures Ellen<br />\n(Lisa Gibson), who loved John,<br />\nby relating all the grisly details<br />\nof the slow painful death. His<br />\nreward for these atrocities<br />\nagainst dignity: Bailey worships<br />\nhim as the font of wisdom, the<br />\nEmersons think of him as<br />\ngoodness and light personified,<br />\nEllen, for some bizarre reason,<br />\n<br />\nlooks to him for comfort. Even<br />\nif you don't like the historical<br />\nThoreau, this hagiography of<br />\nhim as an evil saint is a little<br />\nnauseating.<br />\nIt is hard to tell exactly where<br />\nto pin the blame for this<br />\negregious slander against<br />\nThoreau's good name. Certainly Lawrence and Lee share a<br />\ngood deal of the responsibility:<br />\nin their anxiety to avoid seeming in awe of him, they killed<br />\nany wit or humanity the play or<br />\nits protagonist might have had.<br />\nMr. Nohe, as Thoreau, is little<br />\nhelp: his acting range apparently covers revoltingly smug<br />\nsmirks and thunderous glances<br />\nof rage and virtually nothing in<br />\nbetween. This may not be<br />\nNohe's fault; that is all the<br />\nscript expects him to do.<br />\nMost of the rest of the cast<br />\nacquits itself well. With next to<br />\nno part at all, players of<br />\nmarginal characters like Ellen,<br />\nbrother John, and Bailey do<br />\nmanage to put some life in their<br />\nroles. To whatever extent the<br />\nplay is tolerable, i.e. marginally, it is because the supporting<br />\nactors, without the script to interfere, do their jobs well.<br />\nFor further info, see the Arts<br />\nCalendar.<br />\n<br />\nLanford Wilson's<br />\nFifth of July<br />\nic timing is superb, and their<br />\nscenes together elevate the play<br />\nLanford Wilson's Fifth of to the level of good theater.<br />\nAs always, the intimacy of<br />\nJuly is about the fate of sixties'<br />\nidealism, a topic hammered in- the Fell's Point Theater makes<br />\nto the ground of late, and it has good acting even more exciting<br />\nlittle to say that is new or pro- to watch, and this effect is<br />\nfound on that particular sub- heightened by the fact that all<br />\nject.

Found on the first<br />\nfloor of Gilman Hall, the<br />\nmuseum does contain a truly<br />\nimpressive array of riches from<br />\nthe ancient world.<br />\nThere are numerous examples of pottery, terra cotta<br />\n.statuettes, bronze and iron implements, jewelry, inscribed<br />\n<br />\ndocuments, glass vessels and<br />\nsmall sculptures from the empires of the Near East, Greece,<br />\nRome and Egypt. The collection not only contains fine artworks such as the black and<br />\npink pottery of Greece and the<br />\nblack pottery of Etruria, but it<br />\nalso contains everyday objects<br />\nsuch as bone needles, and locks<br />\nand keys. The museum also<br />\npossesses a Roman. That's<br />\nright, in a stone urn in one of<br />\nthe rooms of the museum there<br />\nare the bone remains of one<br />\nClaudius Alexander, a Roman<br />\ncitizen who lived some time in<br />\n<br />\nthe first century B.C. Unfortunately he was not available<br />\nfor an interview.<br />\nThe objects in the Gilman<br />\nmuseum span the years in<br />\nwhich the great empires of old<br />\nexisted. The oldest pieces date<br />\nfrom the fourth milleniam B.C.<br />\nfrom the city of Ur in<br />\nMesopotamia. The \"youngest\"<br />\nobjects come from Rome in the<br />\nyears between 100 and 500<br />\nA.D.

Though the museum's<br />\npossessions have not been appraised in several years, the collection is estimated to be worth<br />\nabout $700,000.<br />\nThe Gilman museum has a<br />\nhistory almost as long as that of<br />\nthe university. In 1894, a collection was started for teaching<br />\npurposes. The collection has<br />\ngrown since, although the<br />\nuniversity has stopped purchasing objects. Most of the collection is the product of donations<br />\nfrom several interested<br />\nBaltimoreans. Most notable<br />\namong the donors is Helen<br />\nTanzer who donated a large<br />\npart of the Egyptian collection.<br />\nThe donating process continues<br />\n<br />\nas the University just recently<br />\nreceived some Palestinian pottery.

According to owner<br />\nNancy Dugan, the family<br />\nbusiness began after her huslland retired from the Navy and<br />\nbegan going to auctions. The<br />\ntrips to the auctions resulted in<br />\nthe overloading of their house<br />\nwith antiques, and the eventual<br />\nopening of their first store.<br />\nThey obtained a spot on Antique Row in 1976 when a group<br />\nof the buildings went up for<br />\nsale before renovations. Their<br />\ndecision to specialize in silver<br />\nwas partly influenced by the<br />\nlocation of their business,<br />\n\"There are so many wonderful<br />\nsilversmiths in Baltimore.\" As<br />\na specialty, however, silver<br />\npresents a unique problem.<br />\nWhile a piece of antique silver<br />\npossesses value as an antique,.<br />\nit also possesses value as silver,<br />\nan especially active commodity<br />\nin recent years. Its ability to<br />\nbounce from a value of four<br />\ndollars an ounce to fifty dollars<br />\nan ounce (in 1980) and then to<br />\nits present value of eight dollars<br />\nan ounce makes it especially<br />\ndifficult and interesting for<br />\nthose dealing with it. Fortunately, this problem doesn't<br />\nalways affect the value of antique silver, especially where very<br />\nfine, old pieces are concerned.<br />\nTheir age gives them an intrinsic value that can't be negated<br />\nby the fluctuations of silver<br />\nPrices.<br />\nIn many ways, according to<br />\nDugan, antique silver is not as<br />\n<br />\ninaccessible or expensive as it<br />\nmay seem\u2014\"So tell all those<br />\ncollege kids to come on over<br />\nwith their allowances!\" her son<br />\nadds. While this may be an exaggeration (depending on what<br />\nyour allowance is), Dugan does<br />\nnotice that many young married couples are buying antique<br />\nsilverware, not because they<br />\nwant to collect or invest, but<br />\nbecause they find it to be less<br />\nexpensive and of higher quality than new silverware.<br />\nJean Moennich, who's been<br />\nmanaging her parems' shop for<br />\na little over a year, started out<br />\ndifferently from most of the<br />\ndealers on the block. \"My<br />\nparents had been in the business<br />\nand I had been in retail sales.<br />\nI wanted to get into something<br />\nelse.\" Her parents have another<br />\nshop in the suburbs specializing<br />\nin sountry antiques, but the<br />\nAntique Row shops carries a<br />\nwider selection. \"I haven't really limited myself to anything<br />\nsince I'm still new\u2014I'm not<br />\nreally personally interested in<br />\nany particular period.

Intra-squad scrimmages<br />\nwere impossible, as the team<br />\nfound itself with only seven<br />\nmembers and 2/3 of the season<br />\nleft to play. Non-team members<br />\nand casual players were convinced to scrimmage with the<br />\nwomen, or at least to help out<br />\nWith some of the drills.<br />\nTeam morale was at a low<br />\nebb, especially during Intersession, where two-a-day practices<br />\nkept players reasonably sharp,<br />\nbut also kept them from enjoying an extended Christmas<br />\nvacation. Seemingly endless<br />\n<br />\nsprints, and drills and foulshooting was the mode for<br />\nJanuary, along with a few<br />\nleague games that were played.<br />\nThe good news from all this<br />\nwas three victories for the Blue<br />\nJays during the month of<br />\nJanuary. The bad news was<br />\nthat these wins were more than<br />\ncounteracted by six losses. But<br />\nseason records for women's<br />\nbasketball at Hopkins have,<br />\nbeen notoriously lacking in the<br />\nwin column, so when the<br />\nhoopsters finished out the<br />\nseason last night at 6-14, it was<br />\na triumph of sorts. _<br />\nThe triumph belonged<br />\nto the core of players<br />\nwho continued to work, hustle,<br />\nand scrape their way through a<br />\nlong, losing season. There were<br />\nno trophies or championships<br />\nwaiting for them after all the<br />\nheadaches, heartaches, and<br />\ntime-consuming practices.<br />\nThere were some highlights of<br />\nthe season, including Geraldine<br />\nKlauber's selection to the<br />\nCatholic Invitational AllTournament Team, and Dawn<br />\nRichards scoring her 1000th<br />\ncareer point.<br />\nThose six wins didn't come<br />\neasy to these competitors, but<br />\nthen again, neither did the four-<br />\n<br />\nteen losses. The team will miss<br />\nseniors Geraldine Klauber and<br />\nCeleste DeBaptiste, who have<br />\nbeen central figures, enduring<br />\nthree years of losing-record<br />\nplay, but always coming back<br />\nto participate, year after year.<br />\nThey are good examples of the<br />\ncommitment that held the team<br />\ntogether through embarrassing<br />\nlosses, injuries, and frustrating,<br />\nexhausting games. That type of<br />\ncommitment won't win any<br />\nawards or headlines, but it's the<br />\ntype one can be most proud of.<br />\n<br />\nmuch of a breeze; the water<br />\nsmells of chlorine, and the<br />\nspace is severely limited in the<br />\ndiving pool.

The<br />\noriginal 65' shell (that's crew<br />\nlingo for \"a boat\") had approximately 10 feet cut off<br />\nfrom each end so that it would<br />\nfit into the pool. Bubble<br />\nbumpers are attached to both<br />\nends to protect against collision<br />\nand then the shell is tied-off to<br />\nthe sides of the pool. The oars<br />\nused have been purposely<br />\ndisfigured by shaving out their<br />\ncenters to keep the boat<br />\nstationary.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, now that the boat<br />\nis \"on the water\", rowing is the<br />\neasy part.

As<br />\nit often happens, Delaware was<br />\nable to turn this to their advantage, scoring the last five goals<br />\nin the game to make the final<br />\nscore respectable. Freshman<br />\ngoalie Stuart Jones also saw action as he replaced Madden<br />\nduring the last quarter.<br />\nOverall, Zimmerman was<br />\nquite satisfied with the scrimmage, stating that he \"did not<br />\nexpect the team to play so well<br />\ntogether after only one week of<br />\npractices.\" He was also impressed with the team's ability<br />\nto play a \"tough, punishing<br />\ndefense with a lot of contact.\"<br />\nThere was one amusing footnote to the scrimmage. During<br />\nthe third quarter, a dog, which<br />\nresponds to the name Spalding,<br />\nwas able to sneak onto the<br />\nfield.

It's<br />\nsomething I've pushed for<br />\nyears, that in all commercially<br />\ntelevised games, the number of<br />\ntimeouts be reduced from five<br />\nto three per team during a<br />\nregulation game.<br />\nSee, in the past, the normal<br />\nTV game had eight to ten<br />\nautomatic commercial timeouts<br />\non dead balls, usually occuring<br />\nat 16, 12, eight and four<br />\nminutes remaining in each half.<br />\nSo what the coaches would do<br />\nis wait for a commercial<br />\ntimeout, rather than take his<br />\nown. Then he had five left. So<br />\nin the last three minutes of the<br />\ngame, coaches sometimes could<br />\ncall as many as ten timeouts,<br />\nand it would take 30 minutes to<br />\nplay the last three minutes of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nYou must remember, if all<br />\ntimeouts are used in a game,<br />\nsometimes you could have<br />\n18-20 timeouts during a<br />\n40-minute collegiate game.

They attempted a protest<br />\nbefore Commemoration Day ceremonies.<br />\nAnd they even signed petitions\u2014something<br />\nonly candidates for student government do<br />\nthis time of year.<br />\nFor the first time this year, Hopkins<br />\nstudents have shown that they care. Yes, the<br />\nadministration should leave the Hut alone.<br />\nYes, the Hut is a nice place to meet both<br />\nsocially and academically. Yes, the Garrett<br />\nRoom would be a terrible alternative. But<br />\ndid they ever wonder why they're really complaining? Probably not. If there were other<br />\nmeeting places on campus\u2014places providing<br />\na similar atmosphere to the Hut\u2014students<br />\nmost likely wouldn't complain because there<br />\nwould be other places to hang out. They<br />\nwould be aware that there are more significant problems underlying the obvious one.<br />\nThe MSE Library doesn't have enough<br />\nroom, and the Special Collections Room is<br />\none of many solutions to the rare book<br />\ndilemma.<br /><br />\nSo what they're really complaining about<br />\nis the lack of essentially everything on this<br />\ncampus. But only a certain few care about<br />\nsome place where people can pull all-nighters<br />\nand read magazines. They don't realize that<br />\nthere are things far more important than<br />\nHutian activities.<br />\nStudents have to do more. Hopkins isn't<br />\na single issue campus. And they simply can't<br />\ndepend upon Student Council to accomplish<br />\nanything. So the only alternative is for<br />\nstudents to voice their opinions on other<br />\nissues; students must stop complaining<br />\namong themselves because whenever it<br />\ncomes down to doing anything, they always<br />\nsay, \"I can't. I have other things to do.\"<br />\nCareerism is the problem at Hopkins.<br />\nEveryone's more concerned with what they'll<br />\nbe doing after graduation than with what<br />\nthey're doing now. Unfortunately, the administration, though they won't admit it, is<br />\nsatisfied with that attitude. They can simply sit back, relax, and laugh at us.<br />\nThat's what they're doing. They're<br />\nlaughing at us.<br />\nSo what's it gonna be? Will we complain<br />\nabout the Hopkins social life? Will we complain about the placement office that<br />\nprimarily caters to engineers? Will we complain about the muggings and the assaults?<br />\nWill we complain about more than one thing<br />\nthis year?

Even<br />\nif my assailants had not forced<br />\nme to keep quiet, I believe it is<br />\nhighly unlikely anyone would<br />\nhave heard me. My assailants<br />\ninitally threatened me with<br />\nrape, but then first demanded<br />\nto know if I had any money.<br />\nSecurity tells me how lucky I<br />\nwas; true, I was unhurt, but I<br />\nlost $100.00. I normally<br />\nNEVER have more that 50<br />\ncents in my pocket. What could<br />\nhappen if another student is accosted by \"troublemakers\"<br />\nwho had heard of the fact that<br />\na student was hit up for<br />\n$100.00, and he/she is unable<br />\nto produce the like?<br />\nAfter meeting with Officer<br />\nKraft, I obtained a copy of the<br />\nCrime Against Person Report<br />\nfiled on my behalf by Officer<br />\nMcGill for insurance purposes.<br />\nOfficer Kraft warned me that I<br />\nwas in receipt of the document<br />\nin strictest confidence, and I<br />\nwas not to circulate it. I will<br />\nnot, and I have not, but out of<br />\ncuriousity I read it before sending it to my parents. Officer<br />\nKraft's reasoning was that \"it<br />\ncontains bad language\"and it<br />\nshould, the whole incident last<br />\nnight was foul. I was chagrined to find my actions in the in-<br /><br />\ncident misrepresented. After<br />\nreading the report, I learned<br />\nthat I had been grabbed from<br />\nbehind, by one assailant, while<br />\nconfronted by another (true),<br />\nand that I had responded by<br />\npleading with them to leave me<br />\nalone and offering them my<br />\nmoney (FALSE). I let them<br />\ntake my money, yes, hoping to<br />\nsatisfy them from taking<br />\nanything else or from harming<br />\nme. I happened to run from<br />\nthem just afterwards, leaving<br />\nthem laughing. Only because<br />\nthe one behind me loosened his<br />\ngrip on me (and I didn't stick<br />\naround to find out if they were<br />\ndangerously armed).<br />\nI am fully aware of the<br />\nUniversity's taboo on publicizing security trouble on campus.<br />\nI in no way respect it. I believe<br />\nthat had I been more cognizant<br />\nof the danger of walking 500<br />\nyards alone, in a place that I<br />\ncall home, I would have been<br />\nmore careful.<br />\nIn the past month, there have<br />\nbeen a rash of incidents similar<br />\nto mine around campus. Most<br />\nstudents on campus, however,<br />\nare ignorant of this because of<br />\nthe University \"hush-hush\"<br />\npolicy. The danger in this ignorance is further augmented<br />\nbecause the University perceives<br />\nits security jurisdiction to be encompassed by campus property. I venture to disagree: 2680<br />\nHopkins-Homewood students,<br />\nlive, at the very least, a block<br />\nfrom campus.<br />\nI understand the JHU Security has but two patrol cars. I am<br />\nappreciative of the fact that<br />\nafter my mugging last night<br />\nboth cars, and BCPD, scouted<br />\nfor my assailants. However,<br />\nwith a $1,000 tuition hike<br />\nscheduled for next semester,<br />\nand 620 plus incoming<br />\nstudents, why can't Security<br />\noperate as it does for special<br />\nevents, posting officers at accessible points on campus at all<br />\ntimes? I regard the size of this<br />\nUniversity to be an asset to such<br />\na proposal; three to four men<br />\ncould make this Campus<br />\nSAFE. Or isn't that any fun for<br />\nthem?<br />\nIrene V. Robinson<br /><br />\nShame, Shame<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhere the hell is Campus<br />\nSecurity when you need them?<br />\nWithin the past month, three<br />\npeople, two of whom are close<br />\nfriends of mine, were mugged;<br />\none at gun-point, one at knifepoint, and the other by brute<br />\nforce.

One of my<br />\nfriends has been hassled a<br />\nnumber of times; either for not<br />\nbeing a student or for having<br />\nhis dog do his duties in a<br />\n\"restricted\" area.

Why don't they<br />\nget off their butts and start doing something to stop these incidents? This campus is not that<br />\nbig. It should not be hard to<br />\nkeep it safe.<br />\nFinally, students are unaware<br />\nof these attacks because Campus Security likes to keep them<br />\nquiet.

During games<br />\nwhile continually ranting, raving, screaming and whining, he<br />\nmanages to embarrass himself<br />\nand the players, as well as the<br />\nUniversity. He projects an image that I would not want to<br />\nassociate with a school of which<br />\nI am so proud.<br />\nEvery player on the team<br />\nhates him, and not one has any<br />\nrespect for him. He's given us<br />\nthe impression that the feeling<br />\nis mutual.

Bobsled racing is indeed dominated by the East<br />\nGermans, but they are not<br />\n\"Nazis on steroids.\" The East<br />\nGermans are Communists.

In fact, the government<br />\ninvolved was the Canadian<br />\ngovernment, and the action<br />\nprobably occurred in the<br />\nNorthwest Territories. The<br />\nmovie is based on a true book<br />\n(whose name and author escape<br />\nme at the moment), and the<br />\nonly Eskimo tribe mentioned is<br />\nthe Inuit tribe.

Rather, the passage is<br />\nin reference to the people of<br />\nSodom and Gomorrah: \"These<br />\nmen are grumblers and<br />\nfaultfinders; they follow their<br />\nown evil desires; they boast<br />\nabout themselves and flatter<br />\nothers for their own advantage.\" Therefore, claiming<br />\nJude 6-16 is the \"shameful<br />\nresult\" of feminism is a non<br />\nsequitur.<br />\nAlso, John 2:4, in which<br />\nJesus states,\"'Dear woman,<br />\nwhy do you involve me?...My<br />\ntime has not yet come.' \", is<br />\n\"striving<br />\nagainst<br />\nnot<br />\nfeminism\", but referring to doing God's will as in Mark 3:35,<br /><br />\nmother' \". As for Eve \"conning\" Adam, the serpent deceived Eve, who took some fruit<br />\nand ate it, and then \"gave some<br />\nto her husband, who was with<br />\nher, and he ate it.\" (Genesis<br />\n3:6) They both ate by their own<br />\nfree wills.<br />\nIn addition, the New Testament does not describe Jesus'<br />\n\"prosecution by the feminist<br />\nrulers of the world\", as<br />\nJohnson states, because there is<br />\nno mention of any such avantgarde societies in the Bible. As<br />\nwell, claiming that \"our society is facing nuclear annihilation\" because \"the influence of<br />\nwoman upon man has<br />\nseparated him from God\" is a<br />\ngalling attempt to use women as<br />\nscapegoats through scare tactics, much as the Jews were<br />\nblamed by the Nazis for Germany's woes prior to and during WWII. The New Testament<br />\neradicates the separation of<br />\npeople from God (Ephesiang<br />\n2:11-22, John 3:16-18) and the<br />\ncurrent cold war is a result of<br />\ntwo superpowers' foreign<br />\npolicies, not the existence of<br />\nwomen.

Lee, being performed by the Vagabond Players in<br />\n\u2022Fell's Point through March 4.<br />\nThis Thoreau, played blandly<br />\nby Marc Nohe, is opinionated,<br />\ncantankerous, rude, and<br />\ndisagreeable. The real Thoreau<br />\nprobably had these qualities as<br />\nwell, but this Thoreau is also<br />\nstupid, self-righteous, wholly<br />\nlacking compassion and any<br />\nemotion except self-pity; the<br />\nreal Thoreau certainly was not.<br />\nThe play is ostensibly about<br />\none night in 1846 when<br />\nThoreau, who refused to pay<br />\nhis taxes on the grounds that a<br />\nportion of the money would go<br />\nto supporting the war in Mexico, was thrown in the Concord<br />\n(Massachusetts) jail. As one<br />\nmight guess, not a lot happens<br />\nin the one night before someone<br />\n(in the play, his aunt) pays his<br />\ntaxes and has him set free, certainly not enough for a threehour play. The play is padded<br />\nwith snippets supposedly from<br />\nThoreau's life.<br />\nThe depiction of Thoreau<br />\nseems entirely wrong. He's such<br /><br />\nMarc Nohe as Henry Thoreau talks to Fred Kennan, his jailmate.<br /><br />\na fanatic and so unthinkingly<br />\nso, it is hard to imagine an intellectual like Emerson (here<br />\nplayed aptly if stiffly by Bruce<br />\nGodfrey) having any respect for<br />\nhim at all, or for that matter,<br />\nthis hotheaded Thoreau failing<br />\nto despise the discursive Emerson. In life, Thoreau seemed<br />\nthoughtful and deliberate; apparently Lawrence and Lee<br />\ndidn't find him dramatic<br /><br />\nenough, so they rewrote him as<br />\na kind of left-wing version of<br />\nWilliam Jennings Bryant who<br />\nleaps up like a Jack-in-the-Box<br />\nat each new opportunity to talk<br />\nand thereby to make himself<br />\nlook silly. He incessantly<br />\npatronizes his cellmate, Bailey<br />\n(Fred Kernan)treating him like<br />\nan idiot because he is illiterate;<br />\nhe taunts Lydia Emerson<br />\n(Fredericka Courpas)about her<br /><br />\nPress Photo<br /><br />\nsexual frustration; when his<br />\nbrother John (David Keltz)dies<br />\nof tetanus, he tortures Ellen<br />\n(Lisa Gibson), who loved John,<br />\nby relating all the grisly details<br />\nof the slow painful death. His<br />\nreward for these atrocities<br />\nagainst dignity: Bailey worships<br />\nhim as the font of wisdom, the<br />\nEmersons think of him as<br />\ngoodness and light personified,<br />\nEllen, for some bizarre reason,<br /><br />\nlooks to him for comfort. Even<br />\nif you don't like the historical<br />\nThoreau, this hagiography of<br />\nhim as an evil saint is a little<br />\nnauseating.<br />\nIt is hard to tell exactly where<br />\nto pin the blame for this<br />\negregious slander against<br />\nThoreau's good name. Certainly Lawrence and Lee share a<br />\ngood deal of the responsibility:<br />\nin their anxiety to avoid seeming in awe of him, they killed<br />\nany wit or humanity the play or<br />\nits protagonist might have had.<br />\nMr. Nohe, as Thoreau, is little<br />\nhelp: his acting range apparently covers revoltingly smug<br />\nsmirks and thunderous glances<br />\nof rage and virtually nothing in<br />\nbetween. This may not be<br />\nNohe's fault; that is all the<br />\nscript expects him to do.<br />\nMost of the rest of the cast<br />\nacquits itself well. With next to<br />\nno part at all, players of<br />\nmarginal characters like Ellen,<br />\nbrother John, and Bailey do<br />\nmanage to put some life in their<br />\nroles. To whatever extent the<br />\nplay is tolerable, i.e. marginally, it is because the supporting<br />\nactors, without the script to interfere, do their jobs well.<br />\nFor further info, see the Arts<br />\nCalendar.<br /><br />\nLanford Wilson's<br />\nFifth of July<br />\nic timing is superb, and their<br />\nscenes together elevate the play<br />\nLanford Wilson's Fifth of to the level of good theater.<br />\nAs always, the intimacy of<br />\nJuly is about the fate of sixties'<br />\nidealism, a topic hammered in- the Fell's Point Theater makes<br />\nto the ground of late, and it has good acting even more exciting<br />\nlittle to say that is new or pro- to watch, and this effect is<br />\nfound on that particular sub- heightened by the fact that all<br />\nject.

Found on the first<br />\nfloor of Gilman Hall, the<br />\nmuseum does contain a truly<br />\nimpressive array of riches from<br />\nthe ancient world.<br />\nThere are numerous examples of pottery, terra cotta<br />\n.statuettes, bronze and iron implements, jewelry, inscribed<br /><br />\ndocuments, glass vessels and<br />\nsmall sculptures from the empires of the Near East, Greece,<br />\nRome and Egypt. The collection not only contains fine artworks such as the black and<br />\npink pottery of Greece and the<br />\nblack pottery of Etruria, but it<br />\nalso contains everyday objects<br />\nsuch as bone needles, and locks<br />\nand keys. The museum also<br />\npossesses a Roman. That's<br />\nright, in a stone urn in one of<br />\nthe rooms of the museum there<br />\nare the bone remains of one<br />\nClaudius Alexander, a Roman<br />\ncitizen who lived some time in<br /><br />\nthe first century B.C. Unfortunately he was not available<br />\nfor an interview.<br />\nThe objects in the Gilman<br />\nmuseum span the years in<br />\nwhich the great empires of old<br />\nexisted. The oldest pieces date<br />\nfrom the fourth milleniam B.C.<br />\nfrom the city of Ur in<br />\nMesopotamia. The \"youngest\"<br />\nobjects come from Rome in the<br />\nyears between 100 and 500<br />\nA.D.

Though the museum's<br />\npossessions have not been appraised in several years, the collection is estimated to be worth<br />\nabout $700,000.<br />\nThe Gilman museum has a<br />\nhistory almost as long as that of<br />\nthe university. In 1894, a collection was started for teaching<br />\npurposes. The collection has<br />\ngrown since, although the<br />\nuniversity has stopped purchasing objects. Most of the collection is the product of donations<br />\nfrom several interested<br />\nBaltimoreans. Most notable<br />\namong the donors is Helen<br />\nTanzer who donated a large<br />\npart of the Egyptian collection.<br />\nThe donating process continues<br /><br />\nas the University just recently<br />\nreceived some Palestinian pottery.

According to owner<br />\nNancy Dugan, the family<br />\nbusiness began after her huslland retired from the Navy and<br />\nbegan going to auctions. The<br />\ntrips to the auctions resulted in<br />\nthe overloading of their house<br />\nwith antiques, and the eventual<br />\nopening of their first store.<br />\nThey obtained a spot on Antique Row in 1976 when a group<br />\nof the buildings went up for<br />\nsale before renovations. Their<br />\ndecision to specialize in silver<br />\nwas partly influenced by the<br />\nlocation of their business,<br />\n\"There are so many wonderful<br />\nsilversmiths in Baltimore.\" As<br />\na specialty, however, silver<br />\npresents a unique problem.<br />\nWhile a piece of antique silver<br />\npossesses value as an antique,.<br />\nit also possesses value as silver,<br />\nan especially active commodity<br />\nin recent years. Its ability to<br />\nbounce from a value of four<br />\ndollars an ounce to fifty dollars<br />\nan ounce (in 1980) and then to<br />\nits present value of eight dollars<br />\nan ounce makes it especially<br />\ndifficult and interesting for<br />\nthose dealing with it. Fortunately, this problem doesn't<br />\nalways affect the value of antique silver, especially where very<br />\nfine, old pieces are concerned.<br />\nTheir age gives them an intrinsic value that can't be negated<br />\nby the fluctuations of silver<br />\nPrices.<br />\nIn many ways, according to<br />\nDugan, antique silver is not as<br /><br />\ninaccessible or expensive as it<br />\nmay seem\u2014\"So tell all those<br />\ncollege kids to come on over<br />\nwith their allowances!\" her son<br />\nadds. While this may be an exaggeration (depending on what<br />\nyour allowance is), Dugan does<br />\nnotice that many young married couples are buying antique<br />\nsilverware, not because they<br />\nwant to collect or invest, but<br />\nbecause they find it to be less<br />\nexpensive and of higher quality than new silverware.<br />\nJean Moennich, who's been<br />\nmanaging her parems' shop for<br />\na little over a year, started out<br />\ndifferently from most of the<br />\ndealers on the block. \"My<br />\nparents had been in the business<br />\nand I had been in retail sales.<br />\nI wanted to get into something<br />\nelse.\" Her parents have another<br />\nshop in the suburbs specializing<br />\nin sountry antiques, but the<br />\nAntique Row shops carries a<br />\nwider selection. \"I haven't really limited myself to anything<br />\nsince I'm still new\u2014I'm not<br />\nreally personally interested in<br />\nany particular period. I just try<br />\nto keep my shop as varied as<br />\npossible.\" She believes that her<br />\nparents' reputation in the<br />\nbusiness and the shop's location<br />\non Antique Row are important<br />\nfactors in its success. Usually,<br />\nthe second factor is hard to obtain, but Ms. Moennich was<br />\nlucky in being able to avoid the<br />\ncompetition for Antique Row<br />\nproperty that often drives the<br />\nprices out of reach. \"This<br />\nbuilding was never on the<br />\nmarket,\" she explains, we<br />\nbought it from someone we<br />\nknew.

Intra-squad scrimmages<br />\nwere impossible, as the team<br />\nfound itself with only seven<br />\nmembers and 2/3 of the season<br />\nleft to play. Non-team members<br />\nand casual players were convinced to scrimmage with the<br />\nwomen, or at least to help out<br />\nWith some of the drills.<br />\nTeam morale was at a low<br />\nebb, especially during Intersession, where two-a-day practices<br />\nkept players reasonably sharp,<br />\nbut also kept them from enjoying an extended Christmas<br />\nvacation. Seemingly endless<br /><br />\nsprints, and drills and foulshooting was the mode for<br />\nJanuary, along with a few<br />\nleague games that were played.<br />\nThe good news from all this<br />\nwas three victories for the Blue<br />\nJays during the month of<br />\nJanuary. The bad news was<br />\nthat these wins were more than<br />\ncounteracted by six losses. But<br />\nseason records for women's<br />\nbasketball at Hopkins have,<br />\nbeen notoriously lacking in the<br />\nwin column, so when the<br />\nhoopsters finished out the<br />\nseason last night at 6-14, it was<br />\na triumph of sorts. _<br />\nThe triumph belonged<br />\nto the core of players<br />\nwho continued to work, hustle,<br />\nand scrape their way through a<br />\nlong, losing season. There were<br />\nno trophies or championships<br />\nwaiting for them after all the<br />\nheadaches, heartaches, and<br />\ntime-consuming practices.<br />\nThere were some highlights of<br />\nthe season, including Geraldine<br />\nKlauber's selection to the<br />\nCatholic Invitational AllTournament Team, and Dawn<br />\nRichards scoring her 1000th<br />\ncareer point.<br />\nThose six wins didn't come<br />\neasy to these competitors, but<br />\nthen again, neither did the four-<br /><br />\nteen losses. The team will miss<br />\nseniors Geraldine Klauber and<br />\nCeleste DeBaptiste, who have<br />\nbeen central figures, enduring<br />\nthree years of losing-record<br />\nplay, but always coming back<br />\nto participate, year after year.<br />\nThey are good examples of the<br />\ncommitment that held the team<br />\ntogether through embarrassing<br />\nlosses, injuries, and frustrating,<br />\nexhausting games. That type of<br />\ncommitment won't win any<br />\nawards or headlines, but it's the<br />\ntype one can be most proud of.<br /><br />\nmuch of a breeze; the water<br />\nsmells of chlorine, and the<br />\nspace is severely limited in the<br />\ndiving pool.

The<br />\noriginal 65' shell (that's crew<br />\nlingo for \"a boat\") had approximately 10 feet cut off<br />\nfrom each end so that it would<br />\nfit into the pool. Bubble<br />\nbumpers are attached to both<br />\nends to protect against collision<br />\nand then the shell is tied-off to<br />\nthe sides of the pool. The oars<br />\nused have been purposely<br />\ndisfigured by shaving out their<br />\ncenters to keep the boat<br />\nstationary.<br /><br />\nOf course, now that the boat<br />\nis \"on the water\", rowing is the<br />\neasy part. Much work, pizza,<br />\nand soda (beer isn't allowed<br />\nduring training) went into the<br />\npreparation and the completion<br />\nof this extensive operation.<br />\nEvenings were sacrificed in<br />\norder to paint oars, to scrub<br />\nriggers, and to build storage<br />\nracks in the \"row house\"<br />\napartment of our assistant<br />\ncoach Stan Tozer.

They carried it up Howard<br />\nStreet, Wyman Park Drive,<br />\nthen upper quad (stopping in<br />\nfront of Gilman for pictures),<br />\npast the freshman quad, and up<br />\nto the gym.<br />\nBut the fun didn't stop.
