This does not imply that the<br />\nveteran is basically different from the non-veteran in regard to<br />\neducation. Nevertheless, the large influx of veterans into colleges<br />\nhas raised the average age of the student and has increased the<br />\npercehtage of undergraduates who are married.<br />\nUnder normal circumstances veterans who are now enrolled<br />\nin the undergraduate school would either be graduates or would<br />\nhave begun' their professional careers.

There were no door prizes, no grades, no<br />\nrewards; yet three hundred and twenty-five students enrolled<br />\nfor the course and others waited at the doors in hope of an empty<br />\nseat.
