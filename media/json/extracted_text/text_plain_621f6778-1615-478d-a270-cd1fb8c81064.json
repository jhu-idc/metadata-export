With the advent of the rushing<br />\nseason it is of the utmost importance that those men who intend to go<br />\nfraternity seriously consider, the attributes as well as the shortcomings<br />\nof making the intimate connection with one groups. Often Freshmen<br />\nhave hartily occepted bids, the consequences of which led them to<br />\nhave cause for regret later on.<br />\nIt has been said that fraternities tend to make snobs of men and<br />\nnarrow their associations to the personnel and trend of thought of one<br />\nparticular group. We believe, however, that a man may be a member<br />\nof a fraternity, deriving the benefits therefrom, and still successfully<br />\nmaintain his associations in campus and community life.<br />\nProspective brothers must realize that fraternity is no saviour and<br />\nprotector which will guide a man through his college career. Such<br />\nmen who adopt this philosophy are considered \"dead wood- in a<br />\nfraternity. One gets out of fraternity only what he puts into it.

We also<br />\nare of the firm conviction that if football were abolished, all other<br />\nintercollegiate sports would shortly have to be discontinued. If football were abolished at Hopkins, other sports would have to be supported by lacrosse. Up to the present, Hopkins has always had good<br />\nlacrosse teams, and has played teams representing institutions of a high<br />\nscholastic standing. There have been few protests against lacrosse.<br />\nLacrosse is now rapidly gaining favor throughout the East. It is a<br />\ngame that holds the interest of the spectator throughout. The bodily<br />\ncontact that draws the crowd to football is also present in this game.<br />\nIt is reasonable to suppose that in the future it will replace the relatively slower game of baseball and become the major spring sport.<br />\nHopkins has held its high position in lacrossee in the past because<br />\nof the skill of its players, and their knowledge of the game due to<br />\nexcellent coaching. During the last several years, Hopkins has retained its position with difficulty, as with an increase in interest in<br />\nthe sport, other institutions are employing better coaches and finding<br />\nmore experienced men among their enrollment. When these institutions have teams that can compete with Hopkins in skill and knowledge of the game, they will consistently win if they have better natural<br />\nathletes.<br />\nThe abolition of football will bring about this situation. In the<br />\npresent freshman class, there are a considerable number of foot-ball<br />\nmandidates who may be expected to be good lacrosse players. There<br />\nare a certain number of these men who would not attend Hopkins if<br />\nfootball is abolished. Because of the emphasis puaced on football,<br />\nnearly all good athlets are primarily interested in this game. For the<br />\nfirst time during the past three years, Hopkins has some good athletes<br />\namong its first year men. A relatively good football team may be expected next year. If football were abolished, these men would attend<br />\nother institutions. Lacrosse would suffer nearly as much as football,<br />\nand with the decay of lacrosse, all other inter-collegiate sports would<br />\nhave to be abolished.<br />\nSome of those who favor the abolition of football, also favor the<br />\nabolition of all inter-collegiate sports, but it would be well for those<br />\nwho wish to drop only football because of the poor teams developed,<br />\nto consider the effect this would have on other sports.<br />\n<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nI am a member of the Freshman<br />\nClass, and so the late-lamented<br />\nmid-year's were the first exams I<br />\nhave ever encountered. The exams,<br />\nthemselves, were much as I expected, but the method of marking<br />\nwas, in my opinion, and in most<br />\nother peoples', decidedly erratic.<br />\nAnd since, after all, marks are the<br />\nonly visible results of a half-year's<br />\nwork, to which we can refer, it certainly seems that the administration<br />\nhas introduced a faulty system,<br />\nwhere only an absolutely perfect<br />\none should be used.<br />\nThere should be a standard that<br />\nwould be prevalent all over the college. With the present H, S and F<br />\nmethod, no such standard exists. It<br />\nhas been my experience to hear two<br />\nteachers express far different opinions as to how these marks should<br />\nbe given. One told me that there<br />\nwas a definite numerical number<br />\nwhich separates the wheat from the<br />\nchaff\u2014the H's from the S's and<br />\nfrom the F's. Then another quite<br />\nheatedly stated that the standard<br />\nlies entirely in the teacher's sense<br />\nof discretion\u2014which, if one can go<br />\nby results, are decidedly varied. An<br />\nH with one professor will probably<br />\nbe an S with another.<br />\nNow, I, in company with a host<br />\nof others, am aiming for entry into<br />\nthe Medical School. It seems to me<br />\nmarks are the most important thing<br />\nupon which entry can be based.<br />\nAlso, scholarships and grants are<br />\nbased upon them\u2014with the exception of those given athletes, of<br />\ncourse. The question naturally<br />\narises in anyone's mind as to how<br />\nanything can be based on a host of<br />\nambiguous H, S and F's. A mere<br />\nshade of difference can distinguish<br />\nbetween an honor student, and one<br />\nwho is merely satisfactory. And<br />\nthat shade would probably depend<br />\nupon the idiosyncrasies of the various profs. Thus, a man whose<br />\nteachers worked upon the numerical basis, would and does in practically every case, receive a grade<br />\nsuperior to that of the man who<br />\nmust depend on his teacher's sense<br />\nof discretion, and what with these<br />\nkid instructors, there are many<br />\nteachers who have not even reached<br />\nthe age of discretion.<br />\nThus, it is my opinion, a return<br />\nto the numerical system should be<br />\nimmediately affected, and I believe<br />\nthat hundreds of others agree with<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nme.<br />\nVOX CAMPULI.<br />\n<br />\nperhaps to the dearth of good<br />\nteams.

This was his answer to Dr.<br />\nWilliam Welch, professor of the<br />\nHistory of Medicine in the Medical School, who also retires this<br />\nJune, and who credited his advanced age to good luck.

Often Freshmen<br />\nhave hartily occepted bids, the consequences of which led them to<br />\nhave cause for regret later on.<br />\nIt has been said that fraternities tend to make snobs of men and<br />\nnarrow their associations to the personnel and trend of thought of one<br />\nparticular group. We believe, however, that a man may be a member<br />\nof a fraternity, deriving the benefits therefrom, and still successfully<br />\nmaintain his associations in campus and community life.<br />\nProspective brothers must realize that fraternity is no saviour and<br />\nprotector which will guide a man through his college career. Such<br />\nmen who adopt this philosophy are considered \"dead wood- in a<br />\nfraternity. One gets out of fraternity only what he puts into it. It<br />\nmust be realized, finally, that fraternity is only an integral part of a<br />\nuniversity and that one must not become too absorbed in its folds to<br />\ndevote the proper amount of time to other university institutions which<br />\nS. L.<br />\nare of equal, if not more importance<br /><br />\nABOLISH ALL SPORTS?<br />\nweek we attempted to point out that the abolition of football<br />\nLAST<br />\nwould in no way aid any program of physical education. We also<br />\nare of the firm conviction that if football were abolished, all other<br />\nintercollegiate sports would shortly have to be discontinued. If football were abolished at Hopkins, other sports would have to be supported by lacrosse. Up to the present, Hopkins has always had good<br />\nlacrosse teams, and has played teams representing institutions of a high<br />\nscholastic standing. There have been few protests against lacrosse.<br />\nLacrosse is now rapidly gaining favor throughout the East. It is a<br />\ngame that holds the interest of the spectator throughout. The bodily<br />\ncontact that draws the crowd to football is also present in this game.<br />\nIt is reasonable to suppose that in the future it will replace the relatively slower game of baseball and become the major spring sport.<br />\nHopkins has held its high position in lacrossee in the past because<br />\nof the skill of its players, and their knowledge of the game due to<br />\nexcellent coaching. During the last several years, Hopkins has retained its position with difficulty, as with an increase in interest in<br />\nthe sport, other institutions are employing better coaches and finding<br />\nmore experienced men among their enrollment. When these institutions have teams that can compete with Hopkins in skill and knowledge of the game, they will consistently win if they have better natural<br />\nathletes.<br />\nThe abolition of football will bring about this situation. In the<br />\npresent freshman class, there are a considerable number of foot-ball<br />\nmandidates who may be expected to be good lacrosse players. There<br />\nare a certain number of these men who would not attend Hopkins if<br />\nfootball is abolished. Because of the emphasis puaced on football,<br />\nnearly all good athlets are primarily interested in this game. For the<br />\nfirst time during the past three years, Hopkins has some good athletes<br />\namong its first year men. A relatively good football team may be expected next year. If football were abolished, these men would attend<br />\nother institutions. Lacrosse would suffer nearly as much as football,<br />\nand with the decay of lacrosse, all other inter-collegiate sports would<br />\nhave to be abolished.<br />\nSome of those who favor the abolition of football, also favor the<br />\nabolition of all inter-collegiate sports, but it would be well for those<br />\nwho wish to drop only football because of the poor teams developed,<br />\nto consider the effect this would have on other sports.<br /><br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nI am a member of the Freshman<br />\nClass, and so the late-lamented<br />\nmid-year's were the first exams I<br />\nhave ever encountered. The exams,<br />\nthemselves, were much as I expected, but the method of marking<br />\nwas, in my opinion, and in most<br />\nother peoples', decidedly erratic.<br />\nAnd since, after all, marks are the<br />\nonly visible results of a half-year's<br />\nwork, to which we can refer, it certainly seems that the administration<br />\nhas introduced a faulty system,<br />\nwhere only an absolutely perfect<br />\none should be used.<br />\nThere should be a standard that<br />\nwould be prevalent all over the college. With the present H, S and F<br />\nmethod, no such standard exists. It<br />\nhas been my experience to hear two<br />\nteachers express far different opinions as to how these marks should<br />\nbe given. One told me that there<br />\nwas a definite numerical number<br />\nwhich separates the wheat from the<br />\nchaff\u2014the H's from the S's and<br />\nfrom the F's. Then another quite<br />\nheatedly stated that the standard<br />\nlies entirely in the teacher's sense<br />\nof discretion\u2014which, if one can go<br />\nby results, are decidedly varied. An<br />\nH with one professor will probably<br />\nbe an S with another.<br />\nNow, I, in company with a host<br />\nof others, am aiming for entry into<br />\nthe Medical School. It seems to me<br />\nmarks are the most important thing<br />\nupon which entry can be based.<br />\nAlso, scholarships and grants are<br />\nbased upon them\u2014with the exception of those given athletes, of<br />\ncourse. The question naturally<br />\narises in anyone's mind as to how<br />\nanything can be based on a host of<br />\nambiguous H, S and F's. A mere<br />\nshade of difference can distinguish<br />\nbetween an honor student, and one<br />\nwho is merely satisfactory. And<br />\nthat shade would probably depend<br />\nupon the idiosyncrasies of the various profs. Thus, a man whose<br />\nteachers worked upon the numerical basis, would and does in practically every case, receive a grade<br />\nsuperior to that of the man who<br />\nmust depend on his teacher's sense<br />\nof discretion, and what with these<br />\nkid instructors, there are many<br />\nteachers who have not even reached<br />\nthe age of discretion.<br />\nThus, it is my opinion, a return<br />\nto the numerical system should be<br />\nimmediately affected, and I believe<br />\nthat hundreds of others agree with<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nme.<br />\nVOX CAMPULI.<br /><br />\nperhaps to the dearth of good<br />\nteams.

This was his answer to Dr.<br />\nWilliam Welch, professor of the<br />\nHistory of Medicine in the Medical School, who also retires this<br />\nJune, and who credited his advanced age to good luck. For, according to Dr. Swartz, his devotion<br />\nto geology has kept him in the open,<br />\nand has made of him a confirmed<br />\nlover of the outdoors.<br /><br />\n-Two things are needed in college: Specialization, which makes<br />\nthe man effective, and general education, which gives him a cultured<br />\nattitude.

His father had been a<br />\nprofessor of theology for some<br />\ntime, and Dr. Swartz characterizes<br />\nhim as a man of great intellect.<br />\nBut the family stayed in Baltimore<br />\nonly a short while, for the ministerial duties of the father carried<br />\nthem all over the country.<br />\nEven as a youngster, Dr. Swartz<br />\nDr. Harris E.

One of the main purposes of a college education is to<br />\nintroduce a world of thought, although it may mean acquaintance<br />\nwith subjects which may never be<br />\nused.\"<br />\nIn remarking upon his associations with the college, Dr. Swartz<br />\nsaid : \"My relations to the student<br />\nbody have been very delightful to<br />\nme personally, and I will remember<br />\nmy years of teaching with esteem<br />\nand pleasure. Students of the University are very fine fellows, and it<br />\nhas been gratifying to me to see so<br />\nmany of my former students become influential men in geological<br />\nstudies.
