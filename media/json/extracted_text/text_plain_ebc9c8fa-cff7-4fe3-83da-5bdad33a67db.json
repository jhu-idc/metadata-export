We have<br />\nbeen given the definition of the<br />\nuniversity as a 'community of<br />\nscholars' so many times that the<br />\nvery hyposcrisy of the<br />\npronouncement makes us cry out<br />\nin protest. The definition is<br />\nclearly false; the notion of a<br />\ncommunity of similar types<br />\nimplies .equality, in this case<br />\nintellectual equality\u2014nothing<br />\ncould be further from the truth.<br />\nThe university has a strict<br />\nhierarchical structure with a<br />\nmaster-servant relationship as<br />\npronounced as that in any big<br />\nbusiness organization. The<br />\nbreakdown of that structure is<br />\none of the chief objectives of<br />\ncampus protest and reform, but<br />\nthat breakdown appears quite<br />\nimpossible. In fact, most<br />\nadministrators, professors and<br />\nmany students consider such a<br />\nbreakdown as completely<br />\nundesirable: the distinct divisions<br />\nbetween the three groups must,<br />\nthey say, be maintained if the<br />\nuniversity is to function. \"If God<br />\nhad meant for students to<br />\nadministrate...\"<br />\nThe Whole Sick Crew<br />\nEven if this breakdown was<br />\naccomplished, only a part of the<br />\nproblem would be solved. The<br />\nsupporters of the status quo feel<br />\nthat the university, being the<br />\ncenter of, education in a<br />\ncommunity, must remain pure,<br />\ndistinct and detached from that<br />\ncommunity. \"The ivory tower<br />\nmust be maintained,\" comes the<br />\nprofessional cry. \"The university<br />\ncould not function if it was given<br />\nover to involving itself as a part of<br />\nthe rest of the urban society\".<br />\nThe dilemma begins to emerge.<br />\n\"Professors\" educate students;<br />\n\"students\" are educated by<br />\nprofessors\u2014by mutual definition.<br />\nThe professorial class of our<br />\nfeudal hierarchy teach classes,<br />\nwrite books and do research\u2014for<br />\nbusiness, for government, maybe<br />\neven just for knowledge itself.<br />\nThe professor has his private life<br />\nlike any other human being,<br />\nhis`moonlighting' interests as<br />\ncorporation member, his<br />\nacademic clique,his post-tenure<br />\nsecurity which can easily lull him<br />\ninto complacency so that he sits<br />\nlaurels, ability,<br />\non his<br />\nintelligence, and does nothing.<br />\nThe student (shall I clarify that<br />\nwith \"undergraduate\" or are we<br />\n<br />\nall in the same boat?) is the serf in<br />\nthis academic village.

The American education<br />\nsystem now equates dollar yield<br />\nwith relative time in school. At<br />\nHopkins it costs a student about<br />\n$70 per semester hour (one<br />\ncredit) so that presumably this<br />\ncapital should be expected to<br />\nhave a specific dollars and cents<br />\nyield (so many times $70) after<br />\nfour or more years of college<br />\neducation, and this yield can be<br />\n(and has been) measured by<br />\ncomparing his salary with that of<br />\nthe average high school graduate.<br />\nIt is a neat system, but hardly one<br />\nwith which to judge the merits of<br />\nan education.<br />\nIf it is possible for a few<br />\nmoments to drop this rather<br />\ncynical approach, we might<br />\nassume that perhaps the student<br />\nhas private educational ambitions<br />\nas well as monetary ones.<br />\n\"In that case (shout the princes<br />\nand the lords from the tops of<br />\nGilman tower) the student may<br />\npersue his separate educational<br />\ngoals within the framework of the<br />\nuniversity\".

The<br />\norganization is charged with that<br />\nmost hienous of modern crimes:<br />\nthat it lacks \"relevance\". The<br />\neditorial is badly written. There is<br />\nnot a decent English sentence in<br />\nthe whol piece. But that is not the<br />\nend, only the beginning, of the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nThe essential weakness of the<br />\neditorial derives from the fact<br />\nthat the author so plainly wants<br />\nto become \"involved,\" to<br />\n\"participate\" in the very<br />\n\"confrontations\" and indulge in<br />\nthe very \"rhetoric\" he so roundly<br />\ncondemns. This reader suspects<br />\nthat he has been kicked out of the<br />\nlocal chapter of the SDS on<br />\ngrounds of illiteracy. If this is the<br />\ncase, I respectfully urge the<br />\nEditor of the News-Letter to<br />\nkindly employ his offices to get<br />\nhim re-instated at the earliest<br />\npossible date. The SDS needs the<br />\ndues. The News-Letter needs new<br />\nblood.<br />\nThe purpose of this letter is<br />\nnot to please that the SDS is<br />\nrelevant. Indeed, it has never<br />\noccured to this reader that it<br />\nwas\u2014at least, in the cosmic sense<br />\nthat the editorial in question<br />\nasserts is essential. And, it is<br />\nexactly this sense of what is<br />\nrelevant and what is not that<br />\ndestroys the meaning of what<br />\nmight have been some<br />\nbadly-needed criticism. One<br />\ngathers that any political activity<br />\nwhich does not promise the<br />\nimmediate politization of the<br />\nentire population, the immediate<br />\namelioration of all disadvantaged<br />\ngroups in the nation, the<br />\nimmediate establishement of<br />\ntruth, justice, brotherhood,<br />\nfreedom and peace, etc., etc., is<br />\nnot \"relevant\". Alas, SDS (and a<br />\nnumber of other groups that<br />\ncome to mind)fail this fascinating<br />\ntest with flying colors.<br />\nMy own conclusion is that it is<br />\nthe editorial in question which is<br />\nirrelevant. And, as you have<br />\ngathered, my standards of<br />\nrelevance are somewhat more<br />\nmodest than the author of \"Still<br />\nLooking.\"<br />\nI submit that if students and<br />\nother individuals who are seeking<br />\nchanges for the better limit their<br />\n(Continued on Page 15)<br />\n<br />\nReformThinking<br />\n(Continued from Page 12)<br />\n<br />\non issues directly or even<br />\nindirectly affecting those two<br />\ngroups.

Both institutions have<br />\nevery intention of maintaining the<br />\npresent relationship; it is other<br />\nuniversity-hospital complexes<br />\nwhich must re-examine their<br />\nconnections,\" commented Ross<br />\nJones, Vice-President in charge of<br />\nUniversity affairs at Hopkins.<br />\nThis relationship, stretching<br />\ninto its first century and still<br />\nviable, began with the inception<br />\nof the university and the1iosp.ita.1<br />\nin the .late 1800's. In JOiiit<br />\nHopkins will was specified the<br />\nbasic structure of the two<br />\ninstitutions which has existed<br />\nnearly unchanged to the present<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe Hopkins fortune of over 7<br />\nmillion dollars was divided<br />\nbetween the University and the<br />\nHospital, establishing each as a<br />\nseparate corporate entity.<br />\nHopkins, in his will named two<br />\nseparate boards of trustees, one<br />\nfor the hospital and one for the<br />\nuniversity. Certain members were<br />\ncommon to both boards. This<br />\nmethod of liason has been<br />\npreserved even to the present<br />\nboards: the chairman of the<br />\nUniversity board of Trustees, for<br />\nexample, in on the Hospital<br />\nboard. This facilitates<br />\nintercommunication between the<br />\nboards and prevents any<br />\ndifficulties which might arise<br />\nbetween the two.<br />\nNot A Super Board<br />\nA Joint Committee of Trustees<br />\nalso exists to coordinate the two<br />\nbodies and discuss matters of<br />\ncommon interest. It does not<br />\nfunction as a super board, but<br />\nrather, in the words of Jim Butler,<br />\nDirector Director of Public<br />\nRelations, it is a \"communications device.\"<br />\nUnder the Hospital's Board of<br />\nTrustees, is the office of<br />\nPresident, which until a few years<br />\nago was known as the Chief<br />\nExecutive Office.

The recent establishment<br />\nof a Medical Planning and<br />\nDevelopment Committee points<br />\nup the close ties these<br />\norganizations must and do have.<br />\nThe committee is a five<br />\nmembered board, consisting of<br />\nthe Presidents of the Hospital and<br />\nthe University, the Dean of<br />\nMedicine and the Dean of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health, and a<br />\nDirector of Planning of the<br />\nmedical institutions.<br />\nPersonal Links Also<br />\nThe links between the<br />\nUniversity and the Hospital also<br />\nexist on a personnel basis.

Finally, a simplified, highly effective reading course evolved which, because of its<br />\nworld-wide aspects, earned the name of \"Speedread, International.\"<br />\nPresented first as a college extra-cirricular activity, it was finalized into a method of learning<br />\nso concise that it could be used for home study. To date, over 20,000 students have taken the<br />\nSpeedread course through the mail, at $40 per course.*<br />\n<br />\nWhy SPEEDREAD, International<br />\nis making this special offer:<br />\n<br />\nThe need for more intense number of years spent in medical<br />\nEvery year, the greatest demand for our course occurs at final examination deadlines.

The<br />\norganization is charged with that<br />\nmost hienous of modern crimes:<br />\nthat it lacks \"relevance\". The<br />\neditorial is badly written. There is<br />\nnot a decent English sentence in<br />\nthe whol piece. But that is not the<br />\nend, only the beginning, of the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nThe essential weakness of the<br />\neditorial derives from the fact<br />\nthat the author so plainly wants<br />\nto become \"involved,\" to<br />\n\"participate\" in the very<br />\n\"confrontations\" and indulge in<br />\nthe very \"rhetoric\" he so roundly<br />\ncondemns. This reader suspects<br />\nthat he has been kicked out of the<br />\nlocal chapter of the SDS on<br />\ngrounds of illiteracy. If this is the<br />\ncase, I respectfully urge the<br />\nEditor of the News-Letter to<br />\nkindly employ his offices to get<br />\nhim re-instated at the earliest<br />\npossible date. The SDS needs the<br />\ndues. The News-Letter needs new<br />\nblood.<br />\nThe purpose of this letter is<br />\nnot to please that the SDS is<br />\nrelevant. Indeed, it has never<br />\noccured to this reader that it<br />\nwas\u2014at least, in the cosmic sense<br />\nthat the editorial in question<br />\nasserts is essential. And, it is<br />\nexactly this sense of what is<br />\nrelevant and what is not that<br />\ndestroys the meaning of what<br />\nmight have been some<br />\nbadly-needed criticism. One<br />\ngathers that any political activity<br />\nwhich does not promise the<br />\nimmediate politization of the<br />\nentire population, the immediate<br />\namelioration of all disadvantaged<br />\ngroups in the nation, the<br />\nimmediate establishement of<br />\ntruth, justice, brotherhood,<br />\nfreedom and peace, etc., etc., is<br />\nnot \"relevant\". Alas, SDS (and a<br />\nnumber of other groups that<br />\ncome to mind)fail this fascinating<br />\ntest with flying colors.<br />\nMy own conclusion is that it is<br />\nthe editorial in question which is<br />\nirrelevant. And, as you have<br />\ngathered, my standards of<br />\nrelevance are somewhat more<br />\nmodest than the author of \"Still<br />\nLooking.\"<br />\nI submit that if students and<br />\nother individuals who are seeking<br />\nchanges for the better limit their<br />\n(Continued on Page 15)<br /><br />\nReformThinking<br />\n(Continued from Page 12)<br /><br />\non issues directly or even<br />\nindirectly affecting those two<br />\ngroups.

This<br />\nmethod of liason has been<br />\npreserved even to the present<br />\nboards: the chairman of the<br />\nUniversity board of Trustees, for<br />\nexample, in on the Hospital<br />\nboard.
