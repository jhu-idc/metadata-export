While many are quick to dismiss the U.N. action as<br />\nonly rhetoric,\" -it must be realized just how dangerous the<br />\ndistortion of language can be. It is this aspect, the twisting<br />\nand perversion of the language to meet the ends of the Arab<br />\nStates, that is particularly ominous.<br />\nOne need only go back 30 years to see the relationship<br />\nbetween language and violent bursts of racism. As author<br />\nGeorge Steiner documents in his book Language and Silence,<br />\nthe people of Germany could readily accept the horror<br />\nperpetrated on Jews, Poles, Slays, and others because the<br />\nmeanings of the words in their language were altered to aid<br />\nthe insidious cause. \"'Jude, Pole, Russe came to mean<br />\ntwo-legged lice, putrid vermin which good Aryans must<br />\nsquash, as a party manual said, `like roaches on a dirty wall,'\"<br />\nWrites Steiner.<br />\nThe term \"Final Solution\" came to mean<br />\nfor Germany the death of six million Jews in gas ovens.<br />\nSteiner continues, \"The language was turned upside down to<br />\n\u2014say `light' where there was blackness and 'victory' where<br />\nthere was disaster.\" Because the German people were told<br />\ntheir armies were liquidating \"vermin\" and not Jews, it<br />\nbecame easy for them to accept at the time, just as the<br />\ndesignation of reversals like Stalingrad as \"tragic accidents\"<br />\nblinded the Germans to the reality of the war and helped<br />\nprolong it.<br />\nThe perversion of the word \"racism\" is equally nefarious.<br />\nIf the Jewish people's age-old drive towards nationalism and<br />\nself-determination is \"racist,\" then so is any other nationalist<br />\nmovement, including that of the Palestinian Liberation<br />\nOrganization.<br />\nIf Israel and Jews around the world are to be considered<br />\nracist, what then is the next logical step for the U.N.?

Shriver, former<br />\nhead of the Peace Corps under<br />\nKennedy, made the infamous<br />\nmistake of aligning himself with<br />\nthe S.S. McGovern, sunk<br />\nignominiously in 1972.

The U.N.<br />\nCharter states that the<br />\norganization's purpose is to<br />\npromote international<br />\ncooperation, security, and<br />\nunderstanding.

Its major<br />\naim is to secure for the Jewish people the<br />\nrights possessed by the other nations of<br />\nthe world and to gain complete freedom<br />\nand equality among these nations.<br />\nZionism is the love of Zion,Israel, and the<br />\nphysical and emotional attachment of the<br />\nJewish people to their homeland has<br />\nexisted since time immemorial. A people's<br />\nliberation movement, it is anti-colonialist<br />\nand anti-imperialist, and has for centuries<br />\nfought racism, bigotry and all forms of<br />\nhuman bondage.<br />\nThe fundamental principles of the<br />\nUnited Nations Charter rest on much the<br />\nsame principles as does Zionism. Monday<br />\nnight's action was a tragic self-mockery.<br />\nThe very organization which purportedly<br />\nfights racism and hails liberation now<br />\nviciously slanders these efforts. The<br />\nmanner in which Arab states have<br />\nrewritten the world and Jewish history<br />\nand inserted their own falsifications and<br />\nracist theories, is quite similar to the big<br />\nlies of Hitler.<br />\nThe meaning of Zionism has been bent<br />\nand distorted by the\u2022governments. What is<br />\nracism? It is discrimination based on race.<br />\n<br />\nCalling Zionism racism is absurd. In Israel<br />\nwe see a racially mixed population of<br />\nblack people, brown people and white<br />\npeople. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs<br />\nare full citizens of Israel. They vote in<br />\nelections and sit in the country's<br />\nParliament. The issue of Zionism is ethnic,<br />\nand ethnic pride and \"exclusivity\" are<br />\nwhat nationalism is all about. It is not any<br />\nmore racist to be Jewish than to be<br />\nMoslem, Christian, Italian or Greek.<br />\nIf we talk of racism let us mention<br />\nUganda with the homicidal Idi Amin, who<br />\nexpelled whites and Indians. Saudi Arabia<br />\ndoes not allow a Jew to enter into its<br />\nterritory. Egypt expelled its Jewish<br />\npopulation on purely anti-Semitic grounds<br />\nafter the Six Day War in 1967. Syria<br />\nsegregates and oppresses its Jews and<br />\ndenies them basic civil rights. The Soviet<br />\nUnion requires that the word Jew be<br />\nstamped on all identification materials of<br />\nits Jewish citizens. That country's<br />\nemigration laws also mirror its oppression..<br />\nAll of these nations supported the<br />\nresolution.<br />\nIn attempting to justify and camouflage<br />\ntheir move, supporters of the resolution<br />\nsaid it was anti-Zionist, not i-tti-Semitic.<br />\nThey also argued that Zionism is exclusive<br />\nand thus racist. Both of these contentions<br />\nare incorrect assessments of the situation,<br />\nand thinly-disguised attempts on the part<br />\nof a few third world countries to soothe<br />\ntheir own consciences. Accusing Zionism<br />\nof being exclusive is the height of folly. It<br />\nis a Jewish liberation movement and<br />\nconsequently, Jews are its driving force.<br />\n<br />\nAttempts to divorce anti-Zionism from<br />\nanti-Semitism are highly questionable.<br />\nFrom the beginning of Jewish history,<br />\nfrom the psalms of David to the poetry of<br />\nJudah ha-Levi, Jews have hoped and<br />\nprayed to reach Zion and serve God in its<br />\nshelter. After years of hardship, the 11th<br />\ncentury poet ha-Levi reached Zion and<br />\nwas reportedly slain by an Arab as he bent<br />\nto kiss the earth. He wrote:<br />\n\"Zion, wilt thou not ask if peace's wing<br />\nShadows the captives that ensue t hy<br />\npeace,<br />\nLeft lonely from thine ancient<br />\nshepherding?<br />\nLo!west and east and north and<br />\nsouth\u2014world wide\u2014<br />\nAll those from far and near, without<br />\nsurcease,<br />\nSalute thee!

To call<br />\nfor an end to Zionism is to deny the<br />\nhistorical objective of the Jewish people.<br />\nWhat may appear to be a harmless<br />\nresolution may have dire consequences.<br />\nThis resolution justifies anti-Semitism'. The<br />\nresolution will justify further Arab<br />\nboycotts against Israel and attempts to<br />\nstrangle it economically. By labelling Israel<br />\na racist state one says plainly and clearly<br />\nthat is has no right to exist.

It is in no<br />\nway connected with either the Baltimore<br />\nCity School System or the Hopkins Free<br />\nUniversity. It has no classrooms or<br />\nprofessors. It offers no degrees. It is the<br />\nslow and painful realization of a dream<br />\n<br />\nthat four local residents\u2014Howard Erlich,<br />\nGlenda Morris, Michael Steinberg and<br />\nRuth Siegal\u2014have nurtured for the past<br />\nyear: an alternative to the limitations of a<br />\nstandard university education.<br />\n\"In Baltimorg...Johns Hopkins serves to<br />\neducate primarily the children of the<br />\nwelathy to become good members of the<br />\n<br />\nPorno vs feminism? Follett's goes for $<br />\nBy ELIZABETH SZOMBATHY<br />\nHopefully by now all of us are familiar<br />\nwith the feminist's message, a message that<br />\nasks for the liberation from sexual bias so<br />\nthat women and men can define<br />\nthemselves unrestrained by today's<br />\noppressive stereotypes. However, this<br />\nmessage must not be too familiar, for<br />\nsexism remains here at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nWhile the Follett's Bookstore fails to<br />\nstock periodicals relevant to women, it<br />\nsupplies the Hopkins community with a<br />\nhost of pornographic publications. Perhaps<br />\nthis is indicative of the way the Bookstore<br />\nresponds to the intellectual needs of the<br />\ncommunity. If so, it represents an<br />\nirresponsible and sexist policy.<br />\nThe bookstore would argue that its<br />\npolicy is based on economic<br />\nconsiderations. And most likely, this<br />\nconsideration is true as there are still<br />\ntwisted minds whose sexuality is fed by<br />\nsuch literature. Pornography does not<br />\ncelebrate sexual freedom. It is solely an<br />\ninstrument of sexual hostility, exploiting<br />\nsexual activity.<br />\nInherent in this exploitation is the<br />\nexploitation of women. For women are<br />\ndisplayed as \"anonymous, panting<br />\nplaythings, adult toys, dehumanized<br />\nobjects to be used, abused, broken and<br />\ndiscarded.\" Pornography's design reduces<br />\na woman to an object of sexual access.<br />\nThis theme is antithetical to human<br />\nadvancement and can no longer be<br />\ntolerated. moreover, it is inexcusable that<br />\nat a university which boasts of furthering<br />\n<br />\naction. Nazi Germany is an obvious one.<br />\nIn 1881, seeking to discredit the Russian<br />\nrevolutionary movement, Alexander III<br />\ncharged that the Jews were behind the<br />\nmovement and falsely implicated them in<br />\nhis father's death. In that year and the<br />\nfollowing one, a series of bloody pogroms<br />\nensued and laws forcing Jews to move to<br />\nthe cities were passed. In this case, one<br />\n\"resolution\" took quite a toll.

This is expected, yet<br />\nnot sufficient. The United States and any<br />\nother country that values morality and<br />\nhuman decency should immediately<br />\nwithdraw temporarily from the U.N. and<br />\ncompletely re-assess the scope of its<br />\nactivities within the organization.<br />\nThe U.N. has its cultural and<br />\nhumanitarian services, which are<br />\nimportant. But once they come under the<br />\ninfluence of partisan politics, they cease to<br />\nfulfill their purpose and deteriorate into<br />\nvile instruments of political retribution.<br />\nThe U.N. peace-keeping forces are also an<br />\nimportant part of the organization.<br />\nBut the slanderous and destructive J.N.<br />\nresolutions negate any good the<br />\norganization can do. If the U.N. is alio'wed<br />\nto continue on its present course of<br />\nblatantly anti-Semitic policy, the results<br />\nfor Israel and Jews around the wiarid<br />\nwould be nothing short of disastrous.

The<br />\nbookstore could order two excellent<br />\nwomen's publications, (\"Woman\" and<br />\n\"Women: Journal of Liberation\")<br />\ncurrently on their distributor's lists, but<br />\ndoes not.

The bookstore's profit<br />\nsales? Or the needs of the women at this<br />\n<br />\nUniversity for intelligent and helpful<br />\ninformation? The information in Playboy,<br />\nPlaygirl, Oui, and other publications can<br />\nhardly be consdiered either helpful or<br />\nintelligent, unless one adheres to the<br />\nmyths they embody.

His home, located at Five West Mount<br />\nVernon Place, featured a constantly<br />\ngrowing private gallery, boasting pieces<br />\nfrom all over the world. His son Henry<br />\nWalters shared his enthusiasm for art, and<br />\nso the Henry Walters' Gallery was begun in<br />\n1905, completed in 1908, and opened to<br />\nthe public in 1909. Since that time, the<br />\ncity has benefited from the fruits of the<br />\nlabor of these two men, which include the<br />\nstatuary on Mount Vernon Place proper,<br />\nalong with the Gallery.<br />\nThe renovations made on the building<br />\n<br />\nhave enervated none of its charm. In fact,<br />\nand more modern parts<br />\n.<br />\nthe older<br />\ncomplement one another's charm. The<br />\nGallery has an airy atmosphere due to the<br />\nconstruction of the walls which entails<br />\nexpansive glass windows protected by<br />\nlarge abutted outer concrete aprons.<br />\nAs I looked at exhibits bn various<br />\nfloors, I felt awed. The amount of material<br />\ncannot possibly be covered in any short<br />\nperiod of time except in a superficial<br />\nmanner, and so I was forced to resign<br />\nmyself, equipped with a paucity of artistic<br />\nknowledge and judgement, to a whirlwind<br />\ntour of the Gallery's four levels. Even so,<br />\nan aura of timelessness and sense of the<br />\n<br />\nNew prof Philip Curtin-a touch of Africa<br />\nBy GEORGE B. ZELINSKY<br />\n. Professor Philip D. Curtin, a<br />\ndistinguished scholar specializing in<br />\nAfrican history, recently joined Hopkins'<br />\nHistory Department.<br />\nHailed by History Department chairman<br />\nVernon Litdke as \"...one of the pioneers<br />\nIn the African studies area,\" Curtin was<br />\nthe driving force behind the University of<br />\nWisconsin's acclaimed African history<br />\nProgram. Curtin is credited with changing<br />\nthe perspective of the African studies field<br />\nby concentrating on the role of the<br />\nCommon man in African history. He is<br />\nalso responsible for bringing American<br />\nhistorians into the field.<br />\nCiting Hopkins' intimate atmosphere,<br />\nWhich he considers conducive to<br />\nfaculty/student contact as well as research,<br />\nas a primary factor in his decision to move<br />\neast, Curtin stated that he had no plans for<br />\ndeveloping an African studies program at<br />\nHopkins, at least not comparable to the<br />\none which he created at the University of<br />\nWisconsin. He explained that \"...there is<br />\nno longer as great a need for an African<br />\nstudy program for grad students,\" since<br />\nthe original exigencies have been met.<br />\nCurtin claimed that, \"post-graduate<br />\ntraining can no longer be a major function<br />\nof a university, as was the case in the<br />\n1960's.\"<br />\nDescribing himself as \"just a professor,\"<br />\nCurtin said his immediate plans include<br />\nin the Graduate Study<br />\nParticipation<br />\nProgram in Atlantic History and Culture,<br />\nWhich he termed \"one of the attractive<br />\nthings about Johns Hopkins\" and the<br />\ncollaboration with three colleagues on a<br />\ngeneral history of Africa\u2014through the eyes<br />\n<br />\nof the African.<br />\nWhile acknowledging that the major<br />\nportion of his career has been devoted to<br />\nthe study of the African history, Curtin<br />\nemphasized that he is a \"world historian.\"<br />\n\"Most of the histories of world<br />\ncivilizations have been American history<br />\ntaught backwards,\" Curtin argued. \"The<br />\nhistory of civilization has been the history<br />\nof Western civilization.\" Curtin claimed<br />\nthat he has tried to steer away from the<br />\nethnocentric format of traditional<br />\nhistorical thought and has attempted to<br />\npresent world history in terms of<br />\noverriding patterns.<br />\nIn addition to prominence in his field,<br />\nCurtin ..has drawn attention for his<br />\nsomewhat unorthodox teaching method:<br />\nhe records his lectures and makes the tapes<br />\navailable to his students through the<br />\nschool library. Describing the records as<br />\n\"an effort to be,`modern,\" Curtin<br />\nexplained that in 1971, 'while at the<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin<br />\nRadio Network recorded his lectures for<br />\nits extension program, providing him with<br />\ncopies of the tapes. Not knowing what to<br />\ndo with the tapes, Curtin began to lend<br />\nthem out to students who had missed<br />\nparticular lectures. Soon he was lending<br />\nthem to students who were unable to take<br />\nhis course because of a conflict with<br />\nanother course. Curtin decided to adopt<br />\nthis system on a permanent basis, since it<br />\nfreed him to devote more time to class<br />\ndiscussions\u2014increasing feedback from<br />\nstudents and enabling him to better handle<br />\nindividual problems. Curtin conducted an<br />\ninformal survey of his students, and<br />\n<br />\ndiscovered, to his surprise, that the<br />\nmajority looked favorably upon the<br />\narrangement. He also found that use of the<br />\ntapes aided foreign-born students in their<br />\ncomprehension of the lectures. Although<br />\nCurtin is employing the method at<br />\nHomewood, he pointed out that it is still<br />\ntoo early to gauge the reaction of Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nCurtin has written a series of major<br />\nbooks on the African slave trade. His most<br />\nrecent book, Economic Change in<br />\nPre-Colonial Africa, dealt with the slave<br />\ntrade and its relation to the social and<br />\neconomic structure of African society.<br />\n<br />\nPhilip Curtin<br />\n<br />\npast weaved its spell. Somehow the<br />\ncivilizations and movements represented<br />\nbecame more human and intimate, and<br />\ncreated a feeling of roots, of the<br />\ncontinuity of mankind's existence. This<br />\nappreciation was better effected alone,<br />\nbecause groups, tour and otherwise, tend<br />\nto be noisy, distracting, chatty and<br />\nherded.<br />\nThe thousands of pieces 1,NA/ere in<br />\ndisplays featuring art from Greek,<br />\nEtruscan, Egyptian, and Fertile Crescent<br />\ncivilizations, along with Renaissance<br />\nsculpture, bronzes, and jewelry, French<br />\nseventeenth and eighteenth century and<br />\nMannerist art, German \"Wunderkammer,\"<br />\nRoman sarcophagi, and Egyptian<br />\nsculpture, treasury and mummies; extant<br />\nalso were works under the categories of<br />\nEnglish painting, Italian eighteenth<br />\ncentury, Baroque, Mannerist, decorative,<br />\nRenaissance, and Medieval art, Northern<br />\nEuropean painting, Dutch and Flemish<br />\npainting, Gothic and Late Gothic,<br />\ntapestry, stained glass, Romanesque,<br />\nMedieval manuscipts, Coptic art, as well as<br />\nIslamic and Byzantine objects and<br />\nespecially manuscripts. Also notable were<br />\nthe displays representing impressionism,<br />\nnineteenth century painting, Japanese art,<br />\nacademic painting, Chinese ceramics and<br />\nsculpture, Barye sculpture, products of A.<br />\nJ. Miller, and pieces from India.<br />\nA few items which were especially<br />\ninteresting included \"Jugurtha Before the<br />\nRoman Consul,\" an Italian eighteenth<br />\ncentury oil on canvas by Giovanni Tiepolo<br />\nwhich, to an untrained eye, seemed to<br />\ncapture the tensions and attitudes of the<br />\nconfrontation between the Roman and<br />\nAfrican leaders quite well. \"The Jungfrau,<br />\nSwitzerland,\" by the Swiss Alexandre<br />\nCalame poignantly portrayed a lone man<br />\nin the towering heights of the Alps. Also<br />\nworthy of mention were \"Attack at<br />\nDawn,\" depicting segments of France's<br />\nArmy of the East being surprised at<br />\n'daybreak by German soldiers in a village<br />\nnear the French-Swiss border during the<br />\nFranco-Prussian War; and, \"Returning<br />\nFrom the Fields,\" an oil on canvas by<br />\nBreton showing two peasant women<br />\nleaving the farmland at dusk. The theme<br />\nwhich these four haphazardly selected<br />\npaintings held in common was that of<br />\npeople relating to other human beings and<br />\nnature.<br />\nIn addition to its display of art objects<br />\nthe Walters sponsors periodic lectures.<br />\nSome of the talks soon to be given include<br />\n\"New Light on the Reign of Ahkenaten at<br />\nThebes\" by Donald D.

The people entering have lived<br />\nat 72 degrees their entire life; they stepped<br />\nout of their air-conditioned Cadillacs and<br />\nwent right into the club's confines. I hope<br />\nthey lost their kids' allowance money<br />\ntoday.<br />\nInside, after forfeiting the $2 admission<br />\nprice, a good crowd was already forming,<br />\nhalf of them pickpockets. Old Grandpas<br />\nand Grandmas were everywhere with their<br />\nfolding plastic chairs, Grandpa chewing up<br />\nhis cigar and drawing lines all over his<br />\nprogram, Grandma squeaking \"McCarron!<br />\nI'm going to bet McCarron today!\" What<br />\ndo those 70-year-olds need with any more<br />\nmoney? They're not about to go get<br />\nwasted after hitting the Daily Double, yet<br />\nthey pull tens and twenties out of their<br />\npockets so carefully, slowly handing them<br />\nto a friend to take to the window.<br />\nSomething is wrong, I said, as I checked<br />\nthrough all the singles in my wallet.<br />\nThe other prevalent type was...well, the<br />\nman who bets his welfare or<br />\n<br />\nunemployment check is the man to be<br />\nadmired, I must admit. It's the only way<br />\nto live. Anyway, the horses for the first<br />\nrace, a $3000 claimer, were parading<br />\naround now, a bunch of lamentable<br />\nexcuses for the equine kingdom. I had<br />\nBreazy Lea pegged, from a long night's<br />\nstudy of the Racing Form. Kenny, the<br />\nHorse went for Rehearsal Call, while Magic<br />\nLove was the first half of the Man from<br />\nNew York's double selection (for whom I<br />\nwas betting in absentia). Breazy Lea<br />\nbecame the crowd favorite, a disgusting<br />\nsign. To bet the favorite shows no<br />\nimagination (and offers very little<br />\npayoff)\u2014the majority went crazy in voting<br />\nfor Nixon, but what a sure bet! However,<br />\nthat's politics, this is horse racing, and Red<br />\nT. Beau came across the winner. A poor<br />\nstart, having your favorite horse in the<br />\nform become the crowd's choice, still<br />\nbetting on it, and not even getting to win a<br />\npaltry $2.30.<br />\nMoney attracts flies, very tenacious flies<br />\nal that. It's the ultimate in arrogance to<br />\nhustle at the race track, where people<br />\nbring their money to bet and lose, not to<br />\ngive away. So we see no<br />\nblind-men-with-pencils that squat around<br />\nthe baseball parks, taking it easy; the poor<br />\nbastards would be stomped to death by<br />\nlast-second bettors. The real artists today.<br />\nWe were discussing the ridiculous points<br />\nof the third race when a young lady with a<br />\npearl in her nose casually pinned a<br />\ncarnation on our collars. \"For a nice day,\"<br />\nshe said. She then gave us a free book, The<br />\nScientific Basis of K rsna I Consciousness,<br />\nto read from and learn using the personal<br />\napproach.

Baltimore,<br />\non Madison St., destined to be torn down<br />\nin (gasp!) only a month.<br />\nThe Hot 1 Baltimore, once one of this<br />\nfair city's classiest hotels, is now one of its<br />\nseediest. But don't worry, that's what<br />\nmakes for all the action. The action results<br />\nfrom the composition of the hotel's<br />\nclientele, which is, well, rather strange to<br />\nsay the least. How about three hookers for<br />\nstarters? Add a very grouchy old<br />\ngentleman, a dyke and her younger<br />\nbrother, a canny old lady from Baton<br />\nRouge, and a young former dope-peddler<br />\nlooking for his grandfather. Mix well with<br />\nthe harried hotel staff who can't help but<br />\nget involved in all the madness, and you've<br />\ngot a mixture which is extremely volatile,<br />\nproducing a seemingly endless stream of<br />\nlaughs, tears, and anger. And let's not<br />\nforget Horace's mother (Horace was<br />\nevicted after stealing his own telephone<br />\n<br />\nBill Cocke, Kim berlee Kepper<br />\nand trying to sell it back to the hotel<br />\nmanager).<br />\nThe major parts, especially those of Bill<br />\nand Martha the hooker (alias Lilac), are all<br />\nhandled well, and since there are few<br />\nreally minor characters, this should make<br />\nfor an excellent production.

The<br />\nhorses, the absolute worst of the day,<br />\ncouldn't be seen too well parading about<br />\nin the twilight. A broken or missing leg,<br />\nperhaps, or even two sprinters in a horse<br />\nsuit, could be hidden by a jockey who.<br />\nknew what he was doing. We split a,S3<br />\ntriple wager on the race, hoping to be able<br />\nto retire from competitive life. It was not<br />\nto be: all three finished out and the<br />\nwinners paid $5,051.40. Kenny the Horse<br />\nthrew his program down and stomped it<br />\ninto the concrete, crying \"No! No!\" and<br />\npraying for mass disqualifications. A<br />\ncouple of the tip sheets had selected the<br />\nwinning horse, but they were probably<br />\nwritten by a maniac who, stays up drunk<br />\nthe night before knowing he'll be shot if<br />\nhalf his picks don't conie through.<br />\nI suggested that we stay and search the<br />\nrefuse for winning tickets, or stalk the $50<br />\ncasher's windows waiting for someone<br />\nunder 5'10\", as our odds of success in<br />\nthose ventures couldn't have been worse<br />\nthan the way we'd bet all day.

Presently in the midst of an<br />\ninformation-gathering process, Bell said,<br />\n<br />\n\"This past week we talked to the<br />\nadministrators of the programs. The<br />\nconclusion of these people is that their<br />\nprograms definitely deserved the credits<br />\nthey award.\"<br />\nInstructors of the offerings in the<br />\nChaplain's Office, however, \"feel they<br />\ndeserve more credit than they are now<br />\ngetting,\" according to Bell. Next week<br />\nBell's group will survey student reaction to<br />\nthe courses.<br />\nThe Mayor's Fellowship is a selective<br />\nprogram which places students in<br />\nBaltimore City agencies as interns to<br />\nadministrative officials. The program is<br />\nlargely oriented towards pre-law students,<br />\nplacing students in agencies such as the<br />\nOffice of the Public Defender and the<br />\nState's Attorney's Office.<br />\nThe Curriculum for Political Leadership<br />\nis a similar program which grants six<br />\ncredits to third and fourth year students<br />\nwho work as interns to elected officials in<br />\nstate and local government. A participant<br />\nin last year's program received 300 dollars<br />\nremuneration from the elected official she<br />\n<br />\nworked for as compensation for travel .<br />\nThe Chaplain's offerings combine field<br />\nwork with classroom instruction.<br />\nAccording to students and instructors,<br />\nthey require an extensive time<br />\ncommitment.<br />\nIn addition to the Chaplain's<br />\ncomplaints, several students surveyed<br />\n<br />\ncommented that they were dissatisfied<br />\nwith the running of the Mayor's<br />\nFellowship last spring. Students enrolled<br />\nindicated that a \"B\" letter grade was<br />\nawarded to each of the eighteen<br />\nparticipants in the three credit seminar<br />\nwhich accompanies the six credit<br />\nplacement.<br />\n<br />\nSchool offers<br />\n\u2022 alternatives<br />\nto conventional program<br />\nALTERNATIVE, from pg. 2<br />\ndistributing that enormous number of<br />\ncatalogues each month. Manpower is<br />\ndonated mostly by the organizers without<br />\nany financial compensation. Teachers are<br />\nrequired to put up ten dollars for each<br />\ncourse they offer in order to support the<br />\nsystem and demonstrate their own<br />\nsincerity. Student evaluations are<br />\nscrutinized at the end of each term. In<br />\nextreme instances, the tuition may be<br />\nrefunded, and the instructor may not be<br />\n<br />\nasked to teach again. The system exists<br />\nsolely for the student; there is no<br />\nbureaucratic intervention. In essence, what<br />\nthe student wants, the student gets. This<br />\nwill prove to be a unique experience for<br />\nthose pursuing an academic career at<br />\nHopkins.

The Roland Park Civic League<br />\nimmediately attacked the proposal and<br />\nlobbied in the City Council to save the<br />\nshopping center.<br />\nMonday night the Council passed the<br />\nthird in a series of bills with this aim in 0<br />\nmind, a bill which promises to be a hard<br />\nand a controversial one to enforce. The to<br />\nbill authorizes the City to condemn the<br />\nRoland Park Shopping Center<br />\nstructure, to pay Chertkof a \"just<br />\nthe City<br />\nEven<br />\npast.<br />\nshould be able to do what he wants with<br />\nthe<br />\npractices in<br />\ncompensation,\" and to eventually resell<br />\nthe<br />\nwhich<br />\nin<br />\nDistrict<br />\nthe<br />\nit.\"<br />\nof<br />\nCouncilmen<br />\nthe property with a stipulation that it be<br />\nleft as is.<br />\ncenter lies (Fifth) are divided as to the<br />\nAlexander Stark, another District<br />\ncondemnation.<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nconstitutionality<br />\nvoted in favor of the bill.<br />\nrepresentative<br />\nIn effect, the legislation sets a<br />\nof<br />\nCity<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\ntime<br />\nfirst<br />\na,certain validity<br />\nthe<br />\nis<br />\nrecognized<br />\n\"This<br />\nhe<br />\nAlthough<br />\nprivate<br />\nprecedent, for it expropriates a<br />\nbeen done,\"<br />\nhas<br />\nthis<br />\nClaimed, \"Since<br />\nhe<br />\nthat<br />\nargument,<br />\nBaltimore<br />\nCaplan's<br />\nin<br />\nto<br />\nopposed<br />\nas<br />\nresale,<br />\nProperty for<br />\nReuben Caplan.<br />\nit's debatable, I would opt on the side of<br />\nconfiscation for public use, which has asserted Councilman<br />\nproperty, he<br />\nthe community association in this.\"<br />\nbeen the motive behind condemnation \"When a man owns a piece of<br />\n<br />\nThe long-awaited novel<br />\nby the author of<br />\nTHE RECOGNITIONS<br />\n<br />\nWhat<br />\nmakes<br />\nDuddy<br />\nrun?<br />\n<br />\nThe bill had been the last resort. The<br />\nfirst attempt had been to rezone the area<br />\nto residential use, so that Cherktof, if he<br />\nwere to tear down the building, could<br />\nlegally only replace it with two homes.<br />\nA second effort was to have the<br />\nshopping center declared a Historical<br />\nLandmark. The owner objected, however,<br />\nbecause he would not be given a fair<br />\nchance to sell it himself nor would he be<br />\nadequately reimbursed, according to<br />\nCouncilman Allen Spector.<br />\nThis last bill, then, was passed to try to<br />\nsatisfy both the financial concerns of the<br />\nowner and the more sentimental ones of<br />\nthe community. Other opponents of the<br />\nmeasure on the Council have maintained<br />\nthat it is designed to win votes at the<br />\nexpense of city infringement on an<br />\nindividual's property rights. But most of<br />\nthe Council went along with the measure,<br />\nas is traditional in District-related<br />\nlegislation when the majority of the<br />\nDistrict Councilmen themselves support an<br />\nissue.<br />\nEviction<br />\nWhether or not the bill is signed by the<br />\nMayor (and it most probably will be), bad<br />\nfeelings remain. Chertkof has evicted all<br />\nthe tenants except a pharmacy and a food<br />\nmarket, which both possess long-term<br />\nleases. The residents of Roland Park, on<br />\nthe other hand, increasingly resent the<br />\ninconvenience and the disturbance of<br />\ncommunity tradition which this has<br />\ncaused. And \"the Morg\", because there are<br />\nless people at the center now, only serves<br />\ndinner a few nights a week.<br />\n<br />\nMost movies have a predictable<br />\nlife span. A couple of weeks,or<br />\nmaybe a month or two,and they're<br />\nout of the theatres and out<br />\nof everybody's mind.<br />\n<br />\nA movie called\"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" could have<br />\ngone that route. It's a film about an 18-year-old kid who plans to be a<br />\nreal estate tycoon, movie mogul,sex symbol,and world's greatest con<br />\nartist\u2014all before he's twenty.<br />\nBut a funny thing happened to Duddy when he started to run in movie<br />\nhouses. He ran,and ran,and ran. People kept coming to see him,they<br />\ntalked about him,they came back again.<br />\nAnd the film critics did something rare.They agreed. Duddy made<br />\nthe\"10 best\" list of just about every prominent reviewer.<br />\nWhen those things happen,<br />\na movie has struck a responsive<br />\nchord. And that's the case with<br />\nDuddy. Audiences laugh with<br />\nhim,cry with him, love with him.<br />\nAnd they keep him running.<br />\nJudging by his popularity,<br />\nthere seems to be a bit of<br />\nDuddy in all of us.<br />\nA Paromoun,Release<br />\nfro,not,one C,nerned.oCer,,,e Ltd -Prese,,s<br />\n<br />\nAT=KOTCHIDIF F Im<br />\n<br />\nTNt ArritarrecasearOF<br />\n<br />\nDUDDY ICRAVITZ<br />\nsPorriN RICHARD DREYFUSS<br />\n<br />\nStar of -AMERICAN GRAFFITI' and JAWS<br />\n<br />\nMICHELINE LANCTOT RANDY QUAID JOSEPH WISEMAN<br />\nDENHOUM ELLIOTT XX SILVER ond JACK WARDEN os\"MAX**<br />\nbyTED KOTCHEIFFP.c.d,xed by JOHN ICEMEHYs(,,,,,o,b.,.

Matthew made some joke<br />\nabout how close her engine was getting to<br />\nmelting, and no one really laughed...I<br />\nthink we all remembered what the<br />\nMoroccan said to us in Caquan about these<br />\nm ountains eating<br />\nV olkswagens...Air-cooled cars and the<br />\ndesert aren't the best of companions,so be<br />\nit, but I'm asking whoever's in charge up<br />\nthere to keep Amstraat breathing at least<br />\nuntil we get out of the desert. Amen.<br />\nThe land has slowly been changing<br />\ncomposition since we left Rabat,from the<br />\nrich green valleys of central Morocco to<br />\nthe sage and dry brush between<br />\nQuezzanne and here; this morning we saw<br />\nour first genuine sand dune standing about<br />\nforty feet high and sifting in the wind. For<br />\nthe most part, though, the land here is<br />\nabout fifty-fifty\u2014something like New<br />\nJersey near the shore.<br />\nNo one was as happy as I when we<br />\ntopped the last ridge and saw the Atlantic<br />\nat last. There was a breeze which cooled us<br />\nall off and kept us from seeming so<br />\noverheated, and Amstraat got a good rest<br />\nsince it was all downhill between that<br />\nridge and Terrazout Plage. The only signs<br />\nOf life we saw during that stretch were a<br />\nfew mud huts covered with bamboo and<br />\npalm fronds. We couldn't really tell, but<br />\nthey seemed to be growing tomatoes and,<br />\nin a few places, bananas.<br />\nSo this is Terrazout. I'm sitting in a<br />\nlittle cafe by the ocean called \"Ilippies'<br />\nCafe.\" The walls are of plywood, and are<br />\ncovered with your standard \"Peace, Love,<br />\nGuru was Here,\" graffiti. I'm listening to<br />\nreconstituted Bob Dylan through an<br />\nancient car radio speaker, and there's a fat<br />\nMoroccan learing and tapping his foot<br />\nleaning against the counter. The people<br />\nhere are all Europeans, Australians, and<br />\nEnglish, they all have surfboards, and they<br />\nall seem to have been here for quite some<br />\ntime. Outside the Hippies Cafe the little<br />\nMoroccan sharpies hawk their blankets<br />\nand Japanese jewelry. So much for<br />\nthis\u2014I'm going for another swim.<br />\nFebruary 22, 1975 Terrazout Plage<br />\n\"Paradise, said Adam,<br />\nis a state of mind.\"<br />\nMatthew ran into a Swiss yesterday who<br />\ntreated us to dinner and a smoke, besides<br />\nWhopping all of us in chess. He asked us to<br />\ngo skin-diving off the point today, where<br />\nthe surf is largest and the water the<br />\ndeepest. I was fortunate to have declined:<br />\nMatthew came back with a bruised and<br />\ntorn 'shoulder where an undercurrent<br />\nthrew him into a barnacled wall while he<br />\nwas attempting to save the Swiss from<br />\ndrowning. It turns out that the fool didn't<br />\neven know how to swim and was<br />\naceustomed to :depending on his flippers<br />\nand snorkel for life support. When he lost<br />\nhis mask to a wave, he floundered and<br />\nswallowed a lot of water. Lucky he didn't<br />\ndrown. Anyway, he's taken Matthew<br />\nfurther into his confidence as a result, and<br />\nwe're all eating better as a result. So much<br />\nthe better.<br />\nThe winds picked up today\u2014enough to<br />\nmake everyone miserable. The sand is<br />\neverywhere\u2014we eat it, sleep with it, and,<br />\noutside, we get sandblasted. Needless to<br />\nsay we're pulling out. The Swiss told<br />\nMatthew about a place called Paradise<br />\nValley which is only about 15 km. from<br />\nhere, and there shouldn't be any sand<br />\nstorms there. We're leaving tomorrow,and<br />\nthe Swiss is going to follow sometime later<br />\nthis week.<br />\n<br />\nFebruary 24, 1975<br />\nParadise Valley<br />\n\"Lips sealed, tongue heavy with words<br />\nEyes closed, only open reveal.\"<br />\nEden never folded flower after Adam<br />\nleft. Rather, God broke it into little pieces<br />\nand spread it all over the world. \"Here's a<br />\nbit for you guys,and here's bit for you...\"<br />\nWe chanced on a piece of Eden when we<br />\ncame here. It's an oasis. It's heaven. It's<br />\nthe most beautiful place in the world.<br />\nTo get here, we drove between the<br />\nridges which lie between Banana Village<br />\nand Agadir, then we mounted one for a<br />\nwhile until the road plummeted almost<br />\nstraight down on a series of hairpin<br />\nturns\u2014the likes of which reminded<br />\nMatthew of the roads in Nepal. And so we<br />\ncame down into this womb, driving past<br />\nan abandoned adobe village, past groves of<br />\nroyal palms with banana plants flourishing<br />\nat their bases, and past the 'tiny store<br />\nwhich will be the root' of our sustenance<br />\nduring our days here. The part of the<br />\nvalley we've camped in is less than one<br />\nhundred yards wide. The cliffs are vertical<br />\non either side of us, and there is a stream<br />\nabout one foot deep and fifteen feet wide.<br />\nWe're camped beneath a grove of<br />\npalms 1. There is plenty of hardwood<br />\nabout for our fires, and plenty of clean<br />\nwater in the stream. Best of all, there's<br />\nbeen no sign of a car, which means we<br />\nmay have the fortune not to see a single<br />\nMoroccan while we're here. The wind is<br />\ngone, the temperature is a soothing 75-80<br />\ndegrees, and the sky is blue\u2014blue like'<br />\nArizona. Of course, there is no humidity.<br />\nThe sun set tonight around four, though<br />\nthere is still plenty of indirect light, so I<br />\nhave a feeling it won't be up again until 10<br />\nor so. I can hear the water rushing. It<br />\nechoes between the walls.<br />\nFebruary 30, 1975<br />\nParadise Valley<br />\n\"Most furrowed is the mind<br />\n<br />\nFurrowed and of dark soil<br />\nPowers of thought<br />\nRevolve on the days<br />\nGood God, the Golden Sun!...<br />\n...And I have been made awake<br />\nAnd I have been made aware<br />\nTo Form,and brightness in air<br />\nTo form, and fire, and flake<br />\nof flame<br />\nThe mad feather and spew<br />\nOf the conscience in air.\"<br />\nThere can't be any place in the world as<br />\nconducive to exercise as this. There are no<br />\nweights here. I can taste it, this liberation,<br />\nthis happy exile, I can taste it with the<br />\nsame distinctive pleasure that I taste the<br />\ndate honey. Not only me; there are the<br />\nothers too. Matthew hasn't stopped<br />\nsmiling (or smoking) since we got here,<br />\nand the French, Jean and Nelie, have<br />\nstopped worrying about how they are<br />\ngoing to make it to Mauritania with the<br />\nborder into the Spanish Sahara closed.<br />\nThen, too, there are our new found<br />\nfriends, Demian, Andromache, and Ken<br />\nwho we met on our first excursion up to<br />\nthe pools. Demian was standing on his<br />\nhead in the middle of the path,<br />\nAndromache was meditating under a plam,<br />\nand Ken was lying naked on a rock in the<br />\nsun. They, believe it or not, came here<br />\nover a year ago and have lived like seraphs<br />\non honey, dates, bananas, and whatever<br />\nfood the few Moroccans who live in the<br />\nvalley give to them. Ken swears that none<br />\nof them have spent more than ten dollars<br />\nsince they came, and that was when<br />\nDemian's sister sent him a little money for<br />\nChristmas. Incredible? All of their eyes are<br />\nglazed,- not by hashish, but by happiness.<br />\nIndubitable happiness.<br />\nTHE POOLS<br />\nThe cause of every good thing in<br />\nParadise Valley (that is, if God himself<br />\ndoesn't supervise from the overlooking<br />\npeaks) is a spring which starts in the east<br />\nwhere the ridges come together again to<br />\n<br />\nseal off the valley. The spring is high in the<br />\nside of the ridge, from which it falls some<br />\nthirty feet to form a pool in the rock. This<br />\nis the first pool, and its sides are of a green<br />\nand white veined soapstone, as are all of<br />\nthe rest in the long declension of pools<br />\ndown to the stream. We never made any<br />\nattempt to count them but there are those<br />\ntwo feet deep and six feet long, and there<br />\nare those ten feet deep and ten feet across.<br />\nI don't know how to describe it. Between<br />\npools there is usually a walkway about six<br />\nfeet wide with the stream in the center,<br />\npolishing the stone as it has for these<br />\nthousands of years.<br />\nEvery morning we come up here to lie<br />\nbeside the bottom-most of the pools,<br />\nwhich is about fifteen feet deep and<br />\ntwenty feet in diameter. It is almost<br />\ncircular, and it is filled with fish which live<br />\nin the cracks in the walls. I can see the<br />\nbottom, and it is magnified, and it is<br />\nbeautiful. Today it is around 80 degrees<br />\nand the water is about sixty. We will lie in<br />\nthe sun all day, tanning where we have<br />\nnever been tan before. I will write,<br />\nMatthew will smoke, the French will make<br />\nlove somewhere above us. We'll all swim,<br />\nand then the Isun will ,set about four. The<br />\nlight will still be good, though, and we'll<br />\nall lie on the rocks feeling drunkenly<br />\nrested. About that time we'll hear the first<br />\nsound of the flutes on the ridge, which<br />\nwill grow a little bit louder every few<br />\nminutes, and about five we'll see the first<br />\nforms moving down the mountain towards<br />\nthe pools. The sounds, once diminished,<br />\nwill soon fill the entire valley, rushing,<br />\nquick, undulating sounds every kin to the<br />\nwater rushing by our sides. And then the<br />\nyoung shepherds will come near us,<br />\npeering over the rocks at our unabashed<br />\nand naked selves, the sheep will drink their<br />\nfill, and their sounds mellifluous will be<br />\nwith us as we trek our way back to camp<br />\nbeneath the palms.<br />\n<br />\nBirth control bogs on U.S. campuses<br />\n(CPS)\u2014College administrators used to<br />\nthink that if they did not provide birth<br />\ncontrol services on campus, female<br />\nstudents would either stay celibate or go<br />\nto a local clinic off campus. Either way,<br />\nthe university washed its hands of the<br />\nwhole morality question and avoided<br />\ntaking a stand on the right of college<br />\nwomen to contraception and counselling.<br />\nThe federal legislation against sex<br />\ndiscrimination known as Title IX may<br />\nhave changed all that and forced<br />\nuniversities into the vanguard of family<br />\nplanning services. Although a requirement<br />\nto provide birth control devices is not<br />\nincluded in the new Department of<br />\nHealth, Education, and Welfare's<br />\nregulations, some women's groups claim<br />\nthat the implication is there.<br />\nWhat Title IX does say is that any<br />\ninstitution which receives any federal<br />\nfunds and \"provides full coverage health<br />\nservice shall provide gynecological care.\"<br />\nBut \"gynecological care\" does not<br />\nnecessarily imply distributing birth control<br />\ndevices. One spokeswoman for the Alan<br />\nGuttmacher Institute, the research branch<br />\nof Planned Parenthood, claimed that it iF<br />\ndiscriminatory not to provide<br />\ngynecological care and access to<br />\ncontraceptive services \"because the one<br />\nfundamental difference between men and<br />\nwomen is in regard to their reproductive<br />\nroles and health care needs. If female<br />\nstudents don't get help through the college<br />\nhealth service, they have to purchase it<br />\nthrough a private 'physician or incur health<br />\nand pregnancy risks.\"<br />\nThe fact is, most college women need<br />\naccess to birth control services. According<br />\nto the Commission on Population Growth<br />\n<br />\nand the American Future, nearly half of<br />\nthe unmarried women in the United States<br />\nhave had sexual intercourse by age 19. The<br />\npicture, however, is not one of \"rampant<br />\nsexuality among the sexually<br />\nexperienced,\" but of greatly misinformed<br />\nwomen with vague ideas about how<br />\npregnancy occurs and the use of<br />\ncontraception.<br />\nIn the past, schools have generally<br />\ntreated sex-related health needs as a<br />\nseparate medical need, outside the realm<br />\nof their responsibility to wpmen on<br />\ncampus. And although women students<br />\nusually pay their schools a separate charge<br />\nfor health care, most have had no<br />\nalternative but to rely on a private<br />\nphysician for gynecological care and<br />\ncontraceptive advice, resulting in<br />\nadditional costs to the student.<br />\nWith increasingly liberal attitudes<br />\ntoward visitation,. coed dorms and<br />\ncohabitation, more schools are including<br />\nbirth control clinics in their health<br />\nservices. Some schools, however, are still<br />\nfighting against the dissemination of<br />\ncontraceptive advice on their campuses.<br />\nRecently the Board of Regents of<br />\nArizona State University(ASU)forbid the<br />\ncampus health service from giving family<br />\nplanning counselling and birth control<br />\ndevices to students. The Regents' decision<br />\nis now being contested in court, but<br />\nmeanwhile women students are shuttled<br />\noff to the local Planned Parenthood which<br />\nsees an average of 35 patients a day.<br />\n\"Sixty percent are students and more than<br />\nhalf of that figure a're ASU students,\" one<br />\nworker there said.<br />\nThe attitude of the Regents, according<br />\nto the Student Association President of<br />\n<br />\nASU is well reflected in an editorial that<br />\nappeared in the Arizona Republic. \"The<br />\npublic education system does not need to<br />\nadd a function designed to bail out<br />\nstudents whose frolicsome sexual freedom<br />\nis pursued with abandon, often with sad<br />\nresults. Now is the time for them to learn<br />\non their own the costs of promiscuity, and<br />\nto either use common sense or pay.\"<br />\nEven those who do use common sense<br />\nend up paying. Although birth control is<br />\noffered on many more campuses now than<br />\never before, women students are often<br />\nexpected to support such services with<br />\nmoney in addition to their regular health<br />\ncare fees. At the University of California<br />\nat Davis, students interested in getting<br />\ncontraceptives through their health service<br />\nwill pay $17.50 a visit not including the<br />\ncost of the device itself. The $17.50 will<br />\nhave to be paid before an appointment at<br />\nthe clinic can be made. The fee is<br />\nnecessary, state officials claim,because the<br />\nhealth service fees from students are<br />\ndesignated only for the treatment of<br />\n\"acute or sub-acute\" conditions.<br />\nWomen students pay in other ways, too.<br />\nMany have to wait two or three months to<br />\nset up an appointment with a gynecologist<br />\nthrough the health service. At Washington<br />\nUniversity in St. Louis, there is one<br />\ngynecologist for 5000 female students.<br />\nThe health service at Washington U will<br />\ntake care of emergency gynecological<br />\nproblems right away but as the<br />\ngynecological nurse explained, \"We can't<br />\nconsider a request for birth control as an<br />\nemergency. We hate to tell women they<br />\nhave to wait .an extra month and they<br />\ndon't like to hear it, but there is nothing<br />\nwe can do.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fDANCE<br />\nMARATHON<br />\nFINALS<br />\n<br />\n3,1,,E,M7MME,QT/1,11<br />\n<br />\npage 10/newA-letter/november 14, 1975<br />\n<br />\n9:30PM Friday to 12:00 Noon Sunday<br />\nThe Glass Pavillion<br />\nJohns Hopkins Union<br />\n<br />\nDon't Miss It!<br />\n<br />\nclassifieds<br />\nLOST NECKLACE Silver bead,<br />\ncoral, hishi, necklace.

This year's<br />\n12-1-1 regular season record is quite a<br />\nturnabout from last year's 577-2 mark and<br />\nsets the stage for the Jays NCAA<br />\nfirst-round Division III playoff game with<br />\nLoch Haven (Pa.) State on Saturday at the<br />\n<br />\nPennsylvanian's home field.<br />\nEarlier in the week, Coach Oliver's<br />\ncharges notched their eleventh triumph by<br />\nblanking the Green Terrors of Western<br />\nMaryland 3-0 Tuesday at Homewood.<br />\nHopkins controlled the game with their<br />\ncross-state arch-rivals from start to finish,<br />\nbarely allowing the Terrors to mount any<br />\ntype of sustained offensive threat.<br />\nHopkins midfielder Joe Rutkowski<br />\nopened the scoring when he connected on<br />\na penalty kick at the 18:45 mark of the<br />\n<br />\nfirst half.

Each of those<br />\nsquads had finished with a won-lost record<br />\nof about .500 or less and many observers<br />\nexpected a similar performance from this<br />\nyear's team.<br />\nHowever, armed with his rich soccer<br />\nbackground and coaching philosophy,<br />\nOliver has been the catalyst in leading the<br />\nBlue Jays to a 12-14 regular season mark,<br />\nan MAC sectional championship and an<br />\nNCAA tournament bid.<br />\nBob Oliver was born, raised and has<br />\nlived his entire life here in Baltimore. He<br />\nPlayed high school soccer at City College<br />\nand continued the sport when he attended<br />\nTowson State Teachers College.<br />\nWhile at Towson, he played under Doc<br />\nMinnegan\u2014a man Oliver considers not<br />\nOnly the \"finest fundamentalist around,\"<br />\nbut a man who was \"more than a<br />\ncoach\u2014he was a teacher and friend as<br />\nwell.\"<br />\nDuring his years of varsity competition<br />\nunder Minnegan as both a wing and a<br />\nhalfback, Oliver did not play in a losing<br />\ngame.<br />\nUpon graduation, Oliver went back to<br />\nteach at his alma mater\u2014City College. He<br />\nwanted to continue in soccer, but hadn't<br />\ndecided whether to go into coaching or<br />\nOfficiating. Ken Van Sant, Athletic<br />\nDirector at City College \u2022at the time,<br />\ninfluenced the decision by offering Oliver<br />\n<br />\nthe opportunity to coach the JV soccer<br />\nteam\u2014an opportunity he immediately<br />\nseized.<br />\n\"It was a blessing,\" the Blue Jay mentor<br />\nrecalls, adding quickly, \"although I've had<br />\nmany second thoughts about coaching<br />\nmany times since.\"<br />\nOliver became varsity coach two years<br />\nlater and remained at City until 1966. In<br />\nthat year, he took a similar post at Mt. St.<br />\nJoe\u2014a position he held until coming to<br />\nHopkins in the summer of 1971.<br />\n\"They expressed an interest in me,\" the<br />\ncoach commented when asked how he<br />\nbecame associated with the job here at<br />\nHomewood. \"Marshall Turner, who was<br />\nthen the Athletic Director, called me, I<br />\ncame for an interview and the job was<br />\nmine.<br />\n\"My job was not to make Hopkins an<br />\nimmediate winner\u2014it was just to try and<br />\nupgrade the program.\"<br />\nUpon arriving at Homewood Coach<br />\nOliver began to evaluate the material and<br />\nprepare for the future.<br />\n\"Of the players that were here,\" that he<br />\nrecalls, \"the interest was there, but<br />\nsomething was lacking.<br />\nSoccer wasn't a big part of their<br />\nHopkins life.\"<br />\n\"I had a design in mind. I saw it as a<br />\nchallenge to try to turn it around. It<br />\nwould take patience and time, but it<br />\nwould be a lot better when I finished that<br />\nwhen I started.\"<br />\nThe new coach began to recruit local<br />\nsoccer talent .to feather the Blue Jays nest.<br />\nAmong his first recruits were Lou<br />\nPodrazik and Joe Rutkowski\u2014integral<br />\nmembers of this year's team.<br />\nHowever, Oliver did not look at players<br />\n<br />\nfor any particular place on the field.<br />\n\"There are basically two positions,\"<br />\naccording to Oliver. \"Goalie and the rest<br />\nof them.\"<br />\nAmong the 'rest of them', Coach Oliver<br />\nfeels that the \"midfield is my biggest<br />\nbaby\u2014they can make a line go.

But, it's not over yet.<br />\nNothing in athletics is ever finished.\"<br />\nHe admits though that he likes the<br />\nfuture of soccer here at Homewood.<br />\n\"The immediate prospects are bright,\"<br />\nhe said. \"We lose just four people to<br />\ngraduation this year.\"<br />\n<br />\nHomewood swimmers to<br />\nmake debut this evening<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nHomewood aquatic fans can catch their<br />\nfirst glimpse of the 1975-76 Hopkins swim<br />\nteam tonight when Coach Frank<br />\nComfort's charges conduct the 2nd<br />\nAnnual Hopkins Draft meet at 7:30 p.m.<br />\nin Homewood pool.<br />\nBlues vs. Jays<br />\nBoth the squad and the coaching staff<br />\nwill be evenly split in half with the<br />\n\"Blues\" opposing the \"Jays\" and Coach<br />\nComfort acting as \"commissioner\".<br />\n<br />\nGridders look to bring record up to .500<br />\nBy STEVE HAAS<br />\nMotivated by the possibility of salvaging<br />\na .500 season even with all the misfortune<br />\nwhich has befallen them thus far, the<br />\nHopkins football team travels to Carlisle,<br />\nPennsylvania tomorrow to battle<br />\nDickinson College in this year's edition of<br />\nthe annual divisional football rivalry.<br />\n\"If we can win the game with Dickinson<br />\nSaturday and beat Western Maryland next<br />\nweek,\" hypothesized Hopkins coach<br />\nDennis Cox,\"then we'llfinish 4-4-1 for the<br />\nseason and 4-2-1 in the division, which<br />\nisn't too bad considering the problems<br />\nwe've had.\"<br />\nBoth teams enter the contest with<br />\nsimilar problems. As Cox observed,\"They<br />\ndon't have a whole lot of kids and they've<br />\nhad a lot of injuries. Most of their players<br />\nare the same size as ours.\" Dickinson head<br />\ncoach Wilbur Gobrecht, now in his<br />\neleventh season at the helm, could easily<br />\nhave made the same synopsis of the Blue<br />\nJays.<br />\nFullback John Coad is expected to be<br />\n<br />\nthe only Blue Jay player to miss this game,<br />\nas numerous players have finally recovered<br />\nsufficiently to return to full-time action.<br />\nDickinson, with a record of 2-5-1 after<br />\ntheir victory over Ursinus last week, and<br />\nHopkins both showed a complete absence<br />\nfrom among the leaders in this week's<br />\nleague statistics.<br />\nTeam statistics give indications of an<br />\noffensive edge for the Blue Jays and<br />\ndefensive advantage to the Red Devils, but<br />\nneither margin is significantly impressive.<br />\nOffensively, Hopkins averages 305 total<br />\nyards per game, while their opponents<br />\nsport a 270-yard average. The Blue Jays<br />\naverage a 19-yard edge in rushing and<br />\npassing per game, but these are not truly<br />\nindicative of what the game will be like.<br />\nKey Threat<br />\nJim Gerlach is the leading running back<br />\nfor the Red Devils and is the key to their<br />\noffense. \"We have to stop Gerlach to win<br />\nthe game,\" indicated Cox.<br />\nThe recent emergence of the one-two<br />\noffensive punch of Brett Miles rushing and<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Booters a 2-0 halftime lead.<br />\n. Rutkowski also closed the scoring just<br />\neight minutes into the second forty-five<br />\nminutes as he fired another penalty kick<br />\ninto the net. This chance arose when a<br />\nTeasdale head shot, moving towards an<br />\nopen corner of the goal, was punched out<br />\nin desperation by a Western Maryland<br />\ndefenseman.<br />\nThe Jays continued their offensive<br />\nassault for the rest of the game, although<br />\nthey could not add to their 3-0 advantage.<br />\nThe Green Terror goalie was mainly<br />\nresponsible for this, racking up 15 saves by<br />\ngames end.<br />\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the<br />\nfield, Homewood netminder Ken Seuess<br />\nwas forced to make only four saves en<br />\nroute to his seventh shutout of the season.<br />\n\"It's a game we totally dominated,\" was<br />\nthe way Hopkins Coach Bob Oliver<br />\nevaluated his team's effort.<br />\nI Bench Strength<br />\n\"When you shoot that many times(the<br />\nJays had 39 shots), it's a good sign,\" the<br />\ncoach continued. \"We would have had<br />\nmore goals, but their keeper made some<br />\nfine plays.\"<br />\nOliver was also pleased with the way his<br />\nreserves were able to contribute.<br />\n\"Cazzy (Bruce Cazenave) did an<br />\noutstanding job coming in,\" the Blue Jay<br />\nmentor noted. \"It's important that<br />\nsomeone can come off the bench and do<br />\nthe job for us.\"<br />\nIn the preliminary game, the Hopkins<br />\nJ.V. squad downed their Western<br />\nMaryland counterparts by a similar score<br />\nof 3-0.

Shapp,now governor of<br />\nPennsylvania, is perhaps the<br />\ndarkest of dark horses. Two years<br />\nago he gained national notoriety<br />\nwhen he bargained with the<br />\ntruckers in Pennsylvania to break<br />\nup their protest of limited fuel<br />\nsupplies. Since then, Shapp's<br />\npicture appeared in the national<br />\npress just once: when a flood in<br />\nHarrisburg poured water into his<br />\nliving room. Clearly, the best the<br />\ngovernor can hope for is to<br />\narrive at the National Convention<br />\nin New York as a \"favorite son\"<br />\ncandidate.<br />\nMorris Udall follows Shapp at<br />\nthe more civil hour of eleven.<br />\nOne of the earliest candidates to<br />\ntoss his hat in the ring, the<br />\nrepresentative from Arizona<br />\npresents somewhat of a paradox.<br />\nIn a year when Americans have<br />\ncomplained of old politicians<br />\nadvocating New Deal solutions<br />\nfor complex problems, the young<br />\nand vigorous Udall should be a<br />\nwelcome addition to the<br />\nDemocratic landscape. However,<br />\nUdall's reception has been tepid<br /><br />\nThe recent vote of the U.N. General Assembly declaring<br />\nZionism racist is troubling to all men of conscience on several<br />\naccounts. While many are quick to dismiss the U.N. action as<br />\nonly rhetoric,\" -it must be realized just how dangerous the<br />\ndistortion of language can be. It is this aspect, the twisting<br />\nand perversion of the language to meet the ends of the Arab<br />\nStates, that is particularly ominous.<br />\nOne need only go back 30 years to see the relationship<br />\nbetween language and violent bursts of racism. As author<br />\nGeorge Steiner documents in his book Language and Silence,<br />\nthe people of Germany could readily accept the horror<br />\nperpetrated on Jews, Poles, Slays, and others because the<br />\nmeanings of the words in their language were altered to aid<br />\nthe insidious cause. \"'Jude, Pole, Russe came to mean<br />\ntwo-legged lice, putrid vermin which good Aryans must<br />\nsquash, as a party manual said, `like roaches on a dirty wall,'\"<br />\nWrites Steiner.<br />\nThe term \"Final Solution\" came to mean<br />\nfor Germany the death of six million Jews in gas ovens.<br />\nSteiner continues, \"The language was turned upside down to<br />\n\u2014say `light' where there was blackness and 'victory' where<br />\nthere was disaster.\" Because the German people were told<br />\ntheir armies were liquidating \"vermin\" and not Jews, it<br />\nbecame easy for them to accept at the time, just as the<br />\ndesignation of reversals like Stalingrad as \"tragic accidents\"<br />\nblinded the Germans to the reality of the war and helped<br />\nprolong it.<br />\nThe perversion of the word \"racism\" is equally nefarious.<br />\nIf the Jewish people's age-old drive towards nationalism and<br />\nself-determination is \"racist,\" then so is any other nationalist<br />\nmovement, including that of the Palestinian Liberation<br />\nOrganization.<br />\nIf Israel and Jews around the world are to be considered<br />\nracist, what then is the next logical step for the U.N.? A war<br />\nof political and economic attrition, or perhaps a military<br />\nassault against the \"racist\" Israelite, as ldi Amin of Uganda<br />\nplans against South Africa.<br />\nIt is actions such as that taken by the General Assembly<br />\nearlier this week that demonstrate the need for continued<br />\neconomic, political, military, and moral support to Israel by To the Editor:<br />\nthe U.S.\u2014the only friend the small nation has in these times<br />\nWith regard to the article<br />\nof oil-as-king. Egypt can call for moderation and negotiation which appeared in the November<br />\nwith Israel and at the same time endorse a resolution, which 7th edition of the News-Letter<br />\nwhen taken to its logical conclusion, would mean the end of entitled, \"Buchanan and Hersh<br />\nBattle It Out in Symposium\";<br />\nIsrael as we know it.<br />\nperhaps Mr. Sokolow would like<br />\nprevented<br />\nbe<br />\nmust<br />\nNations<br />\nUnited<br />\nThe lie begun in the<br />\nto<br />\nbe Pat Buchanan's<br />\nspeak<br />\nmust<br />\nnation,<br />\nas<br />\na<br />\nand<br />\nfrom growing.

In fact, the reason he<br />\nbegan campaigning so early was<br />\nto capture public attention.<br />\nApparently, he still has a long<br />\nroad to travel before gaining the<br />\nmass support necessary for a<br />\nPresidential candidate.<br />\nAnother novice to Presidential<br />\nraces is the governor of Georgia,<br />\nJimmy Carter. Carter's slim<br />\norganization has done a fine job<br />\nin publicizing the governor's<br />\nachievements in his home state.<br />\nOne is especially struck by the<br />\nability of a white politician in the<br />\nDeep South to genuinely<br />\nreconcile the aspirations of the<br />\nblack constituency in his state<br />\nwith the local white leadership.<br /><br />\nThe man to beat<br />\nUnfortunately, Carter, like Udall,<br />\nhas suffered from underexposure.<br />\nFred Harris, former Oklahoma<br />\nsenator, and Terry Sanford,<br />\nformer governor of North<br />\nCarolina, can both be grouped in<br />\nthe \"never-to-be\" category.<br />\nNeither candidate has the<br />\norganization or personal charisma<br />\nto attract significant support<br />\noutside of his respective<br /><br />\nregion. As to Sanford's claim<br />\nthat he is a viable Democratic<br />\nalternative to Wallace, one can<br />\nonly reply that this former<br />\npresident of Duke would have a<br />\ndifficult time being elected to the<br />\nDuke student council.<br />\nHowever, two of the speakers<br />\nmay have a strong chance of<br />\nbeing nominated: Sargent Shriver<br />\nand Birch Bayh. Shriver, former<br />\nhead of the Peace Corps under<br />\nKennedy, made the infamous<br />\nmistake of aligning himself with<br />\nthe S.S. McGovern, sunk<br />\nignominiously in 1972. Shriver,<br />\na native Marylander, carries<br />\nenough support from the party's<br />\nOld Guard (labor, big city<br />\nmachines), and is appealing<br />\nenough to its younger members<br />\nto emerge as a compromise<br />\ncandidate should the convention<br />\nresult in a deadlock. Moreover, a<br />\nman in the JFK mold, Shriver<br />\ncould stir nostalgia for the \"New<br />\nFrontier\" days.<br />\nBirch Bayh, the junior senator<br />\nfrom Indiana, is also in a<br />\nposition, both ideological and<br />\ngeographical, to attract support<br />\nfrom several segments of the<br />\nparty. In the last two elections,<br />\nthe Democrats have not fared<br />\nwell in the Midwest. Therefore,<br />\nhailing from Indiana could<br />\nindeed give Bayh an advantage<br />\nover Shriver, if not Humphrey.<br />\nMoreover, due to his \"middle of<br />\nthe road\" stance, amiable<br />\nrelations with labor and hard<br />\nwork in the Senate, he has earned<br />\nincreasing prestige within the<br />\nparty.<br />\nPerhaps none of this<br />\nweekend's speakers will one day<br />\noccupy Richard Nixon's chair.<br />\nWell,even if the round of oratory<br />\ndoes not lead to enlightenment,<br />\nit should be a dandy show.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br /><br />\n0000<br />\n(b\u00b0\u00b0q0<br />\nCfP\u00b0\u00b0d\u00b0<br />\ncroo -o 00<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n41111111 10\\<br />\nP*4W<br /><br />\nt<br />\ni r; .4\"11445410ftreOP<br />\n,<br /><br />\n/I<br /><br />\n\"Now this is not necessarily my final decision, mind you...\"<br /><br />\nbiasing, and stereotyping<br />\nconservatives as dull, paranoid,<br />\nhysterical old women who see<br />\n\"commies\" crawling out of<br />\nbushes to be witnessed in quite a<br />\nwhile.

Berchielli<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nThe recent U.N. vote to equate<br />\nZionism with racism deserves<br />\ncomment here because we may<br />\nnow be witnessing the demise of<br />\nthe world's most respected<br />\ninternational organization. This<br />\nconcerns us as members of a<br />\nglobal community. The U.N.<br />\nCharter states that the<br />\norganization's purpose is to<br />\npromote international<br />\ncooperation, security, and<br />\nunderstanding. The U.N. has not<br />\nachieved its goals. A public<br />\noutcry is necessary when this<br />\norganization does not achieve its<br />\npurpose to insure security. A<br />\npublic outcry is imperative when<br />\nthis organization violates its own<br />\ncharter and becomes a vehicle of<br />\npropaganda which exacerbates<br />\nworld tension.<br /><br />\nThe New York Times of<br />\nNovember 12th reported the<br />\nMauritian delegate as stating that<br />\nthe Arab delegates and<br />\nPalestinian observers presented a<br />\ndefinition of Zionism as an<br />\nimperialist, colonialist<br />\nmovement. As such, it must be<br />\ndenounced under Article 1 of the<br />\nU.N. sponsored International<br />\nConvention for the Elimination<br />\nof Racism. Some delegates acted<br />\non this evidence although,<br />\n\"Many people voted without<br />\nknowipg what Zionism is.\" One<br />\nhas little reason to doubt this<br />\ndelegate's statement. Words are<br />\npowerful. The U.N. and its<br />\ndelegates must be careful of what<br />\nthey say and how they say it.<br />\nAmbiguity on their part is<br />\nextremely dangerous. It is<br />\ndisgraceful and irresponsible for a<br />\ndelegate to vote in virtual<br />\nignorance on an issue.

Its major<br />\naim is to secure for the Jewish people the<br />\nrights possessed by the other nations of<br />\nthe world and to gain complete freedom<br />\nand equality among these nations.<br />\nZionism is the love of Zion,Israel, and the<br />\nphysical and emotional attachment of the<br />\nJewish people to their homeland has<br />\nexisted since time immemorial. A people's<br />\nliberation movement, it is anti-colonialist<br />\nand anti-imperialist, and has for centuries<br />\nfought racism, bigotry and all forms of<br />\nhuman bondage.<br />\nThe fundamental principles of the<br />\nUnited Nations Charter rest on much the<br />\nsame principles as does Zionism. Monday<br />\nnight's action was a tragic self-mockery.<br />\nThe very organization which purportedly<br />\nfights racism and hails liberation now<br />\nviciously slanders these efforts. The<br />\nmanner in which Arab states have<br />\nrewritten the world and Jewish history<br />\nand inserted their own falsifications and<br />\nracist theories, is quite similar to the big<br />\nlies of Hitler.<br />\nThe meaning of Zionism has been bent<br />\nand distorted by the\u2022governments. What is<br />\nracism? It is discrimination based on race.<br /><br />\nCalling Zionism racism is absurd. In Israel<br />\nwe see a racially mixed population of<br />\nblack people, brown people and white<br />\npeople. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs<br />\nare full citizens of Israel. They vote in<br />\nelections and sit in the country's<br />\nParliament. The issue of Zionism is ethnic,<br />\nand ethnic pride and \"exclusivity\" are<br />\nwhat nationalism is all about. It is not any<br />\nmore racist to be Jewish than to be<br />\nMoslem, Christian, Italian or Greek.<br />\nIf we talk of racism let us mention<br />\nUganda with the homicidal Idi Amin, who<br />\nexpelled whites and Indians. Saudi Arabia<br />\ndoes not allow a Jew to enter into its<br />\nterritory. Egypt expelled its Jewish<br />\npopulation on purely anti-Semitic grounds<br />\nafter the Six Day War in 1967. Syria<br />\nsegregates and oppresses its Jews and<br />\ndenies them basic civil rights. The Soviet<br />\nUnion requires that the word Jew be<br />\nstamped on all identification materials of<br />\nits Jewish citizens. That country's<br />\nemigration laws also mirror its oppression..<br />\nAll of these nations supported the<br />\nresolution.<br />\nIn attempting to justify and camouflage<br />\ntheir move, supporters of the resolution<br />\nsaid it was anti-Zionist, not i-tti-Semitic.<br />\nThey also argued that Zionism is exclusive<br />\nand thus racist. Both of these contentions<br />\nare incorrect assessments of the situation,<br />\nand thinly-disguised attempts on the part<br />\nof a few third world countries to soothe<br />\ntheir own consciences.

After years of hardship, the 11th<br />\ncentury poet ha-Levi reached Zion and<br />\nwas reportedly slain by an Arab as he bent<br />\nto kiss the earth.

It is in no<br />\nway connected with either the Baltimore<br />\nCity School System or the Hopkins Free<br />\nUniversity. It has no classrooms or<br />\nprofessors. It offers no degrees.

Follett's goes for $<br />\nBy ELIZABETH SZOMBATHY<br />\nHopefully by now all of us are familiar<br />\nwith the feminist's message, a message that<br />\nasks for the liberation from sexual bias so<br />\nthat women and men can define<br />\nthemselves unrestrained by today's<br />\noppressive stereotypes. However, this<br />\nmessage must not be too familiar, for<br />\nsexism remains here at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nWhile the Follett's Bookstore fails to<br />\nstock periodicals relevant to women, it<br />\nsupplies the Hopkins community with a<br />\nhost of pornographic publications. Perhaps<br />\nthis is indicative of the way the Bookstore<br />\nresponds to the intellectual needs of the<br />\ncommunity. If so, it represents an<br />\nirresponsible and sexist policy.<br />\nThe bookstore would argue that its<br />\npolicy is based on economic<br />\nconsiderations. And most likely, this<br />\nconsideration is true as there are still<br />\ntwisted minds whose sexuality is fed by<br />\nsuch literature. Pornography does not<br />\ncelebrate sexual freedom. It is solely an<br />\ninstrument of sexual hostility, exploiting<br />\nsexual activity.<br />\nInherent in this exploitation is the<br />\nexploitation of women. For women are<br />\ndisplayed as \"anonymous, panting<br />\nplaythings, adult toys, dehumanized<br />\nobjects to be used, abused, broken and<br />\ndiscarded.\" Pornography's design reduces<br />\na woman to an object of sexual access.<br />\nThis theme is antithetical to human<br />\nadvancement and can no longer be<br />\ntolerated. moreover, it is inexcusable that<br />\nat a university which boasts of furthering<br /><br />\naction. Nazi Germany is an obvious one.<br />\nIn 1881, seeking to discredit the Russian<br />\nrevolutionary movement, Alexander III<br />\ncharged that the Jews were behind the<br />\nmovement and falsely implicated them in<br />\nhis father's death.

Lying diagonally across from the<br />\nEnoch Pratt Central Library, and near the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory on Mount Vernon<br />\nPlace, the Walters is a vital part of<br />\nBaltimore's cultural heritage. It is<br />\nessentially the bequest of William and<br />\nHenry Walters, collectors and<br />\nPhilanthropists, to the Monumental City.<br />\nWilliam T. Walters arrived in Baltimore<br />\nIn 1841, became increasingly involved in<br /><br />\nThe Walters Art Gallery .<br />\nthe commercial and public affairs of the \u2022<br />\ncity and prior to the Civil War emerged as<br />\na recognized patron,of local aril national<br />\nart. His home, located at Five West Mount<br />\nVernon Place, featured a constantly<br />\ngrowing private gallery, boasting pieces<br />\nfrom all over the world. His son Henry<br />\nWalters shared his enthusiasm for art, and<br />\nso the Henry Walters' Gallery was begun in<br />\n1905, completed in 1908, and opened to<br />\nthe public in 1909. Since that time, the<br />\ncity has benefited from the fruits of the<br />\nlabor of these two men, which include the<br />\nstatuary on Mount Vernon Place proper,<br />\nalong with the Gallery.<br />\nThe renovations made on the building<br /><br />\nhave enervated none of its charm. In fact,<br />\nand more modern parts<br />\n.<br />\nthe older<br />\ncomplement one another's charm. The<br />\nGallery has an airy atmosphere due to the<br />\nconstruction of the walls which entails<br />\nexpansive glass windows protected by<br />\nlarge abutted outer concrete aprons.<br />\nAs I looked at exhibits bn various<br />\nfloors, I felt awed. The amount of material<br />\ncannot possibly be covered in any short<br />\nperiod of time except in a superficial<br />\nmanner, and so I was forced to resign<br />\nmyself, equipped with a paucity of artistic<br />\nknowledge and judgement, to a whirlwind<br />\ntour of the Gallery's four levels.

Curtin, a<br />\ndistinguished scholar specializing in<br />\nAfrican history, recently joined Hopkins'<br />\nHistory Department.<br />\nHailed by History Department chairman<br />\nVernon Litdke as \"...one of the pioneers<br />\nIn the African studies area,\" Curtin was<br />\nthe driving force behind the University of<br />\nWisconsin's acclaimed African history<br />\nProgram. Curtin is credited with changing<br />\nthe perspective of the African studies field<br />\nby concentrating on the role of the<br />\nCommon man in African history. He is<br />\nalso responsible for bringing American<br />\nhistorians into the field.<br />\nCiting Hopkins' intimate atmosphere,<br />\nWhich he considers conducive to<br />\nfaculty/student contact as well as research,<br />\nas a primary factor in his decision to move<br />\neast, Curtin stated that he had no plans for<br />\ndeveloping an African studies program at<br />\nHopkins, at least not comparable to the<br />\none which he created at the University of<br />\nWisconsin. He explained that \"...there is<br />\nno longer as great a need for an African<br />\nstudy program for grad students,\" since<br />\nthe original exigencies have been met.<br />\nCurtin claimed that, \"post-graduate<br />\ntraining can no longer be a major function<br />\nof a university, as was the case in the<br />\n1960's.\"<br />\nDescribing himself as \"just a professor,\"<br />\nCurtin said his immediate plans include<br />\nin the Graduate Study<br />\nParticipation<br />\nProgram in Atlantic History and Culture,<br />\nWhich he termed \"one of the attractive<br />\nthings about Johns Hopkins\" and the<br />\ncollaboration with three colleagues on a<br />\ngeneral history of Africa\u2014through the eyes<br /><br />\nof the African.<br />\nWhile acknowledging that the major<br />\nportion of his career has been devoted to<br />\nthe study of the African history, Curtin<br />\nemphasized that he is a \"world historian.\"<br />\n\"Most of the histories of world<br />\ncivilizations have been American history<br />\ntaught backwards,\" Curtin argued. \"The<br />\nhistory of civilization has been the history<br />\nof Western civilization.\" Curtin claimed<br />\nthat he has tried to steer away from the<br />\nethnocentric format of traditional<br />\nhistorical thought and has attempted to<br />\npresent world history in terms of<br />\noverriding patterns.<br />\nIn addition to prominence in his field,<br />\nCurtin ..has drawn attention for his<br />\nsomewhat unorthodox teaching method:<br />\nhe records his lectures and makes the tapes<br />\navailable to his students through the<br />\nschool library. Describing the records as<br />\n\"an effort to be,`modern,\" Curtin<br />\nexplained that in 1971, 'while at the<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin<br />\nRadio Network recorded his lectures for<br />\nits extension program, providing him with<br />\ncopies of the tapes. Not knowing what to<br />\ndo with the tapes, Curtin began to lend<br />\nthem out to students who had missed<br />\nparticular lectures. Soon he was lending<br />\nthem to students who were unable to take<br />\nhis course because of a conflict with<br />\nanother course. Curtin decided to adopt<br />\nthis system on a permanent basis, since it<br />\nfreed him to devote more time to class<br />\ndiscussions\u2014increasing feedback from<br />\nstudents and enabling him to better handle<br />\nindividual problems. Curtin conducted an<br />\ninformal survey of his students, and<br /><br />\ndiscovered, to his surprise, that the<br />\nmajority looked favorably upon the<br />\narrangement. He also found that use of the<br />\ntapes aided foreign-born students in their<br />\ncomprehension of the lectures. Although<br />\nCurtin is employing the method at<br />\nHomewood, he pointed out that it is still<br />\ntoo early to gauge the reaction of Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nCurtin has written a series of major<br />\nbooks on the African slave trade. His most<br />\nrecent book, Economic Change in<br />\nPre-Colonial Africa, dealt with the slave<br />\ntrade and its relation to the social and<br />\neconomic structure of African society.<br /><br />\nPhilip Curtin<br /><br />\npast weaved its spell. Somehow the<br />\ncivilizations and movements represented<br />\nbecame more human and intimate, and<br />\ncreated a feeling of roots, of the<br />\ncontinuity of mankind's existence.

Add a very grouchy old<br />\ngentleman, a dyke and her younger<br />\nbrother, a canny old lady from Baton<br />\nRouge, and a young former dope-peddler<br />\nlooking for his grandfather. Mix well with<br />\nthe harried hotel staff who can't help but<br />\nget involved in all the madness, and you've<br />\ngot a mixture which is extremely volatile,<br />\nproducing a seemingly endless stream of<br />\nlaughs, tears, and anger. And let's not<br />\nforget Horace's mother (Horace was<br />\nevicted after stealing his own telephone<br /><br />\nBill Cocke, Kim berlee Kepper<br />\nand trying to sell it back to the hotel<br />\nmanager).<br />\nThe major parts, especially those of Bill<br />\nand Martha the hooker (alias Lilac), are all<br />\nhandled well, and since there are few<br />\nreally minor characters, this should make<br />\nfor an excellent production. Give a<br /><br />\nBonnie Raven, Caroline Obrecht, and Keno Rider<br /><br />\nparticularly close listen to April, one of<br />\nthe trio ofladies of the evening. I found her<br />\nfoul mouth peculiarly attractive.<br />\nPace is extremely important in a play of<br />\nthis type, and it is something which the<br />\ndirector (a professional from the<br />\nBaltimore area) has paid a great deal of<br />\nattention to. The play flows evenly, with<br />\nsmooth transitions from one period of<br />\ninteraction to another. In fact, the action<br />\nis so relentless that the audience gets a<br />\nwell-deserved breather only between acts.<br />\nBut don't let this scare you off. Hot I<br />\nBaltimore is Charm City at its most<br />\ninteresting, if unfortunately not its finest.<br />\nGot lots of work - to do? Papers and<br />\nexams piling up on you? Got a buck and a<br />\nhalf? If you want to see some people with<br />\nreal problems, go see Hot I Baltimore at<br />\nthe Barn this weekend, and get down with<br />\nMartha (she hates that name!), Millie,<br />\nApril, Suzie, Mr. Morse, Paul Granger and<br />\nall the rest of the gang. You might be<br />\nmoved to tears, angered, or just plain<br />\noutraged. But one thing's for sure: you<br />\nwon't be bored.<br /><br />\nThe excitement of the International<br />\ngradually subsided, but that was mostly<br />\nfor television, anyway. There were still<br />\ntwo races left on the card, and I wasn't<br />\ngoing away without losing some more<br />\nActually, I hit the exacta in the eighth,<br />\nbut so did everyone else in the park, as it<br />\n.,paid an embarassing $8.80.<br />\nBy the ninth and final race, the sun was<br />\nalready down, which helped the track. The<br />\nhorses, the absolute worst of the day,<br />\ncouldn't be seen too well parading about<br />\nin the twilight. A broken or missing leg,<br />\nperhaps, or even two sprinters in a horse<br />\nsuit, could be hidden by a jockey who.<br />\nknew what he was doing. We split a,S3<br />\ntriple wager on the race, hoping to be able<br />\nto retire from competitive life. It was not<br />\nto be: all three finished out and the<br />\nwinners paid $5,051.40. Kenny the Horse<br />\nthrew his program down and stomped it<br />\ninto the concrete, crying \"No! No!\" and<br />\npraying for mass disqualifications. A<br />\ncouple of the tip sheets had selected the<br />\nwinning horse, but they were probably<br />\nwritten by a maniac who, stays up drunk<br />\nthe night before knowing he'll be shot if<br />\nhalf his picks don't conie through.<br />\nI suggested that we stay and search the<br />\nrefuse for winning tickets, or stalk the $50<br />\ncasher's windows waiting for someone<br />\nunder 5'10\", as our odds of success in<br />\nthose ventures couldn't have been worse<br />\nthan the way we'd bet all day. The grand<br />\nHopkins contingent had lost over $50 at<br />\nLaurel with Kenny the Horse and the<br />\nnon-attendant Man from New York<br />\ndropping about $20 apiece.

Presently in the midst of an<br />\ninformation-gathering process, Bell said,<br /><br />\n\"This past week we talked to the<br />\nadministrators of the programs. The<br />\nconclusion of these people is that their<br />\nprograms definitely deserved the credits<br />\nthey award.\"<br />\nInstructors of the offerings in the<br />\nChaplain's Office, however, \"feel they<br />\ndeserve more credit than they are now<br />\ngetting,\" according to Bell. Next week<br />\nBell's group will survey student reaction to<br />\nthe courses.<br />\nThe Mayor's Fellowship is a selective<br />\nprogram which places students in<br />\nBaltimore City agencies as interns to<br />\nadministrative officials. The program is<br />\nlargely oriented towards pre-law students,<br />\nplacing students in agencies such as the<br />\nOffice of the Public Defender and the<br />\nState's Attorney's Office.<br />\nThe Curriculum for Political Leadership<br />\nis a similar program which grants six<br />\ncredits to third and fourth year students<br />\nwho work as interns to elected officials in<br />\nstate and local government. A participant<br />\nin last year's program received 300 dollars<br />\nremuneration from the elected official she<br /><br />\nworked for as compensation for travel .<br />\nThe Chaplain's offerings combine field<br />\nwork with classroom instruction.<br />\nAccording to students and instructors,<br />\nthey require an extensive time<br />\ncommitment.<br />\nIn addition to the Chaplain's<br />\ncomplaints, several students surveyed<br /><br />\ncommented that they were dissatisfied<br />\nwith the running of the Mayor's<br />\nFellowship last spring. Students enrolled<br />\nindicated that a \"B\" letter grade was<br />\nawarded to each of the eighteen<br />\nparticipants in the three credit seminar<br />\nwhich accompanies the six credit<br />\nplacement.<br /><br />\nSchool offers<br />\n\u2022 alternatives<br />\nto conventional program<br />\nALTERNATIVE, from pg. 2<br />\ndistributing that enormous number of<br />\ncatalogues each month. Manpower is<br />\ndonated mostly by the organizers without<br />\nany financial compensation. Teachers are<br />\nrequired to put up ten dollars for each<br />\ncourse they offer in order to support the<br />\nsystem and demonstrate their own<br />\nsincerity. Student evaluations are<br />\nscrutinized at the end of each term. In<br />\nextreme instances, the tuition may be<br />\nrefunded, and the instructor may not be<br /><br />\nasked to teach again. The system exists<br />\nsolely for the student; there is no<br />\nbureaucratic intervention. In essence, what<br />\nthe student wants, the student gets. This<br />\nwill prove to be a unique experience for<br />\nthose pursuing an academic career at<br />\nHopkins. Students have an active say in<br />\nthe programming, are welcome at all<br />\nmeetings and forums, and have the<br />\nopportunity to instruct in an area of<br />\nparticular interest.<br /><br />\nPLACEMENT BUREAU INTERVIEWS<br />\nGraduate and Professional Schools: Seniors and other interested students.<br />\nMon., Nov. 17<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina\u2014G.S. of Business Admin.<br />\nMon., Nov. 17<br />\nUniv. of Southern California\u2014G.S. of Business<br />\nTues., Nov. 18<br />\nCornell University\u2014School of Law<br />\nTues., Nov. 18<br />\nExperiment in International Living<br />\nWed., Nov. 19<br />\nUniversity of Michigan\u2014G.S. of Business<br />\nThurs., Nov. 20<br />\nHarvard University\u2014 G.S. of Design<br />\nThurs., Nov. 20<br />\nVillanova University\u2014School of Law<br />\nThurs., Nov. 20<br />\nUniv. of Miami\u2014School of Law<br />\nFri., Nov. 21<br />\nDartmouth\u2014Amos Tuck School of Business Admin.<br />\nMon., Nov. 24<br />\nMercer Univ.\u2014School of Law<br />\nWed., Dec. 3<br />\nUniv. of Pa.\u2014Wharton Graduate Division<br />\nThurs., Dec. 4<br />\nColumbia University\u2014G.

The Roland Park Civic League<br />\nimmediately attacked the proposal and<br />\nlobbied in the City Council to save the<br />\nshopping center.<br />\nMonday night the Council passed the<br />\nthird in a series of bills with this aim in 0<br />\nmind, a bill which promises to be a hard<br />\nand a controversial one to enforce. The to<br />\nbill authorizes the City to condemn the<br />\nRoland Park Shopping Center<br />\nstructure, to pay Chertkof a \"just<br />\nthe City<br />\nEven<br />\npast.<br />\nshould be able to do what he wants with<br />\nthe<br />\npractices in<br />\ncompensation,\" and to eventually resell<br />\nthe<br />\nwhich<br />\nin<br />\nDistrict<br />\nthe<br />\nit.\"<br />\nof<br />\nCouncilmen<br />\nthe property with a stipulation that it be<br />\nleft as is.<br />\ncenter lies (Fifth) are divided as to the<br />\nAlexander Stark, another District<br />\ncondemnation.<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nconstitutionality<br />\nvoted in favor of the bill.<br />\nrepresentative<br />\nIn effect, the legislation sets a<br />\nof<br />\nCity<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\ntime<br />\nfirst<br />\na,certain validity<br />\nthe<br />\nis<br />\nrecognized<br />\n\"This<br />\nhe<br />\nAlthough<br />\nprivate<br />\nprecedent, for it expropriates a<br />\nbeen done,\"<br />\nhas<br />\nthis<br />\nClaimed, \"Since<br />\nhe<br />\nthat<br />\nargument,<br />\nBaltimore<br />\nCaplan's<br />\nin<br />\nto<br />\nopposed<br />\nas<br />\nresale,<br />\nProperty for<br />\nReuben Caplan.<br />\nit's debatable, I would opt on the side of<br />\nconfiscation for public use, which has asserted Councilman<br />\nproperty, he<br />\nthe community association in this.\"<br />\nbeen the motive behind condemnation \"When a man owns a piece of<br /><br />\nThe long-awaited novel<br />\nby the author of<br />\nTHE RECOGNITIONS<br /><br />\nWhat<br />\nmakes<br />\nDuddy<br />\nrun?<br /><br />\nThe bill had been the last resort. The<br />\nfirst attempt had been to rezone the area<br />\nto residential use, so that Cherktof, if he<br />\nwere to tear down the building, could<br />\nlegally only replace it with two homes.<br />\nA second effort was to have the<br />\nshopping center declared a Historical<br />\nLandmark. The owner objected, however,<br />\nbecause he would not be given a fair<br />\nchance to sell it himself nor would he be<br />\nadequately reimbursed, according to<br />\nCouncilman Allen Spector.<br />\nThis last bill, then, was passed to try to<br />\nsatisfy both the financial concerns of the<br />\nowner and the more sentimental ones of<br />\nthe community. Other opponents of the<br />\nmeasure on the Council have maintained<br />\nthat it is designed to win votes at the<br />\nexpense of city infringement on an<br />\nindividual's property rights. But most of<br />\nthe Council went along with the measure,<br />\nas is traditional in District-related<br />\nlegislation when the majority of the<br />\nDistrict Councilmen themselves support an<br />\nissue.<br />\nEviction<br />\nWhether or not the bill is signed by the<br />\nMayor (and it most probably will be), bad<br />\nfeelings remain. Chertkof has evicted all<br />\nthe tenants except a pharmacy and a food<br />\nmarket, which both possess long-term<br />\nleases. The residents of Roland Park, on<br />\nthe other hand, increasingly resent the<br />\ninconvenience and the disturbance of<br />\ncommunity tradition which this has<br />\ncaused. And \"the Morg\", because there are<br />\nless people at the center now, only serves<br />\ndinner a few nights a week.<br /><br />\nMost movies have a predictable<br />\nlife span. A couple of weeks,or<br />\nmaybe a month or two,and they're<br />\nout of the theatres and out<br />\nof everybody's mind.<br /><br />\nA movie called\"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" could have<br />\ngone that route. It's a film about an 18-year-old kid who plans to be a<br />\nreal estate tycoon, movie mogul,sex symbol,and world's greatest con<br />\nartist\u2014all before he's twenty.<br />\nBut a funny thing happened to Duddy when he started to run in movie<br />\nhouses. He ran,and ran,and ran. People kept coming to see him,they<br />\ntalked about him,they came back again.<br />\nAnd the film critics did something rare.They agreed. Duddy made<br />\nthe\"10 best\" list of just about every prominent reviewer.<br />\nWhen those things happen,<br />\na movie has struck a responsive<br />\nchord. And that's the case with<br />\nDuddy.

Matthew made some joke<br />\nabout how close her engine was getting to<br />\nmelting, and no one really laughed...I<br />\nthink we all remembered what the<br />\nMoroccan said to us in Caquan about these<br />\nm ountains eating<br />\nV olkswagens...Air-cooled cars and the<br />\ndesert aren't the best of companions,so be<br />\nit, but I'm asking whoever's in charge up<br />\nthere to keep Amstraat breathing at least<br />\nuntil we get out of the desert. Amen.<br />\nThe land has slowly been changing<br />\ncomposition since we left Rabat,from the<br />\nrich green valleys of central Morocco to<br />\nthe sage and dry brush between<br />\nQuezzanne and here; this morning we saw<br />\nour first genuine sand dune standing about<br />\nforty feet high and sifting in the wind. For<br />\nthe most part, though, the land here is<br />\nabout fifty-fifty\u2014something like New<br />\nJersey near the shore.<br />\nNo one was as happy as I when we<br />\ntopped the last ridge and saw the Atlantic<br />\nat last. There was a breeze which cooled us<br />\nall off and kept us from seeming so<br />\noverheated, and Amstraat got a good rest<br />\nsince it was all downhill between that<br />\nridge and Terrazout Plage. The only signs<br />\nOf life we saw during that stretch were a<br />\nfew mud huts covered with bamboo and<br />\npalm fronds. We couldn't really tell, but<br />\nthey seemed to be growing tomatoes and,<br />\nin a few places, bananas.<br />\nSo this is Terrazout. I'm sitting in a<br />\nlittle cafe by the ocean called \"Ilippies'<br />\nCafe.\" The walls are of plywood, and are<br />\ncovered with your standard \"Peace, Love,<br />\nGuru was Here,\" graffiti. I'm listening to<br />\nreconstituted Bob Dylan through an<br />\nancient car radio speaker, and there's a fat<br />\nMoroccan learing and tapping his foot<br />\nleaning against the counter. The people<br />\nhere are all Europeans, Australians, and<br />\nEnglish, they all have surfboards, and they<br />\nall seem to have been here for quite some<br />\ntime. Outside the Hippies Cafe the little<br />\nMoroccan sharpies hawk their blankets<br />\nand Japanese jewelry. So much for<br />\nthis\u2014I'm going for another swim.<br />\nFebruary 22, 1975 Terrazout Plage<br />\n\"Paradise, said Adam,<br />\nis a state of mind.\"<br />\nMatthew ran into a Swiss yesterday who<br />\ntreated us to dinner and a smoke, besides<br />\nWhopping all of us in chess. He asked us to<br />\ngo skin-diving off the point today, where<br />\nthe surf is largest and the water the<br />\ndeepest. I was fortunate to have declined:<br />\nMatthew came back with a bruised and<br />\ntorn 'shoulder where an undercurrent<br />\nthrew him into a barnacled wall while he<br />\nwas attempting to save the Swiss from<br />\ndrowning. It turns out that the fool didn't<br />\neven know how to swim and was<br />\naceustomed to :depending on his flippers<br />\nand snorkel for life support. When he lost<br />\nhis mask to a wave, he floundered and<br />\nswallowed a lot of water. Lucky he didn't<br />\ndrown. Anyway, he's taken Matthew<br />\nfurther into his confidence as a result, and<br />\nwe're all eating better as a result. So much<br />\nthe better.<br />\nThe winds picked up today\u2014enough to<br />\nmake everyone miserable. The sand is<br />\neverywhere\u2014we eat it, sleep with it, and,<br />\noutside, we get sandblasted. Needless to<br />\nsay we're pulling out. The Swiss told<br />\nMatthew about a place called Paradise<br />\nValley which is only about 15 km. from<br />\nhere, and there shouldn't be any sand<br />\nstorms there. We're leaving tomorrow,and<br />\nthe Swiss is going to follow sometime later<br />\nthis week.<br /><br />\nFebruary 24, 1975<br />\nParadise Valley<br />\n\"Lips sealed, tongue heavy with words<br />\nEyes closed, only open reveal.\"<br />\nEden never folded flower after Adam<br />\nleft. Rather, God broke it into little pieces<br />\nand spread it all over the world. \"Here's a<br />\nbit for you guys,and here's bit for you...\"<br />\nWe chanced on a piece of Eden when we<br />\ncame here. It's an oasis. It's heaven. It's<br />\nthe most beautiful place in the world.<br />\nTo get here, we drove between the<br />\nridges which lie between Banana Village<br />\nand Agadir, then we mounted one for a<br />\nwhile until the road plummeted almost<br />\nstraight down on a series of hairpin<br />\nturns\u2014the likes of which reminded<br />\nMatthew of the roads in Nepal. And so we<br />\ncame down into this womb, driving past<br />\nan abandoned adobe village, past groves of<br />\nroyal palms with banana plants flourishing<br />\nat their bases, and past the 'tiny store<br />\nwhich will be the root' of our sustenance<br />\nduring our days here. The part of the<br />\nvalley we've camped in is less than one<br />\nhundred yards wide. The cliffs are vertical<br />\non either side of us, and there is a stream<br />\nabout one foot deep and fifteen feet wide.<br />\nWe're camped beneath a grove of<br />\npalms 1. There is plenty of hardwood<br />\nabout for our fires, and plenty of clean<br />\nwater in the stream. Best of all, there's<br />\nbeen no sign of a car, which means we<br />\nmay have the fortune not to see a single<br />\nMoroccan while we're here. The wind is<br />\ngone, the temperature is a soothing 75-80<br />\ndegrees, and the sky is blue\u2014blue like'<br />\nArizona. Of course, there is no humidity.<br />\nThe sun set tonight around four, though<br />\nthere is still plenty of indirect light, so I<br />\nhave a feeling it won't be up again until 10<br />\nor so. I can hear the water rushing. It<br />\nechoes between the walls.<br />\nFebruary 30, 1975<br />\nParadise Valley<br />\n\"Most furrowed is the mind<br /><br />\nFurrowed and of dark soil<br />\nPowers of thought<br />\nRevolve on the days<br />\nGood God, the Golden Sun!...<br />\n...And I have been made awake<br />\nAnd I have been made aware<br />\nTo Form,and brightness in air<br />\nTo form, and fire, and flake<br />\nof flame<br />\nThe mad feather and spew<br />\nOf the conscience in air.\"<br />\nThere can't be any place in the world as<br />\nconducive to exercise as this. There are no<br />\nweights here. I can taste it, this liberation,<br />\nthis happy exile, I can taste it with the<br />\nsame distinctive pleasure that I taste the<br />\ndate honey. Not only me; there are the<br />\nothers too. Matthew hasn't stopped<br />\nsmiling (or smoking) since we got here,<br />\nand the French, Jean and Nelie, have<br />\nstopped worrying about how they are<br />\ngoing to make it to Mauritania with the<br />\nborder into the Spanish Sahara closed.<br />\nThen, too, there are our new found<br />\nfriends, Demian, Andromache, and Ken<br />\nwho we met on our first excursion up to<br />\nthe pools. Demian was standing on his<br />\nhead in the middle of the path,<br />\nAndromache was meditating under a plam,<br />\nand Ken was lying naked on a rock in the<br />\nsun. They, believe it or not, came here<br />\nover a year ago and have lived like seraphs<br />\non honey, dates, bananas, and whatever<br />\nfood the few Moroccans who live in the<br />\nvalley give to them. Ken swears that none<br />\nof them have spent more than ten dollars<br />\nsince they came, and that was when<br />\nDemian's sister sent him a little money for<br />\nChristmas. Incredible? All of their eyes are<br />\nglazed,- not by hashish, but by happiness.<br />\nIndubitable happiness.<br />\nTHE POOLS<br />\nThe cause of every good thing in<br />\nParadise Valley (that is, if God himself<br />\ndoesn't supervise from the overlooking<br />\npeaks) is a spring which starts in the east<br />\nwhere the ridges come together again to<br /><br />\nseal off the valley. The spring is high in the<br />\nside of the ridge, from which it falls some<br />\nthirty feet to form a pool in the rock. This<br />\nis the first pool, and its sides are of a green<br />\nand white veined soapstone, as are all of<br />\nthe rest in the long declension of pools<br />\ndown to the stream. We never made any<br />\nattempt to count them but there are those<br />\ntwo feet deep and six feet long, and there<br />\nare those ten feet deep and ten feet across.<br />\nI don't know how to describe it. Between<br />\npools there is usually a walkway about six<br />\nfeet wide with the stream in the center,<br />\npolishing the stone as it has for these<br />\nthousands of years.<br />\nEvery morning we come up here to lie<br />\nbeside the bottom-most of the pools,<br />\nwhich is about fifteen feet deep and<br />\ntwenty feet in diameter. It is almost<br />\ncircular, and it is filled with fish which live<br />\nin the cracks in the walls. I can see the<br />\nbottom, and it is magnified, and it is<br />\nbeautiful. Today it is around 80 degrees<br />\nand the water is about sixty. We will lie in<br />\nthe sun all day, tanning where we have<br />\nnever been tan before. I will write,<br />\nMatthew will smoke, the French will make<br />\nlove somewhere above us. We'll all swim,<br />\nand then the Isun will ,set about four. The<br />\nlight will still be good, though, and we'll<br />\nall lie on the rocks feeling drunkenly<br />\nrested. About that time we'll hear the first<br />\nsound of the flutes on the ridge, which<br />\nwill grow a little bit louder every few<br />\nminutes, and about five we'll see the first<br />\nforms moving down the mountain towards<br />\nthe pools. The sounds, once diminished,<br />\nwill soon fill the entire valley, rushing,<br />\nquick, undulating sounds every kin to the<br />\nwater rushing by our sides. And then the<br />\nyoung shepherds will come near us,<br />\npeering over the rocks at our unabashed<br />\nand naked selves, the sheep will drink their<br />\nfill, and their sounds mellifluous will be<br />\nwith us as we trek our way back to camp<br />\nbeneath the palms.<br /><br />\nBirth control bogs on U.S. campuses<br />\n(CPS)\u2014College administrators used to<br />\nthink that if they did not provide birth<br />\ncontrol services on campus, female<br />\nstudents would either stay celibate or go<br />\nto a local clinic off campus. Either way,<br />\nthe university washed its hands of the<br />\nwhole morality question and avoided<br />\ntaking a stand on the right of college<br />\nwomen to contraception and counselling.<br />\nThe federal legislation against sex<br />\ndiscrimination known as Title IX may<br />\nhave changed all that and forced<br />\nuniversities into the vanguard of family<br />\nplanning services. Although a requirement<br />\nto provide birth control devices is not<br />\nincluded in the new Department of<br />\nHealth, Education, and Welfare's<br />\nregulations, some women's groups claim<br />\nthat the implication is there.<br />\nWhat Title IX does say is that any<br />\ninstitution which receives any federal<br />\nfunds and \"provides full coverage health<br />\nservice shall provide gynecological care.\"<br />\nBut \"gynecological care\" does not<br />\nnecessarily imply distributing birth control<br />\ndevices. One spokeswoman for the Alan<br />\nGuttmacher Institute, the research branch<br />\nof Planned Parenthood, claimed that it iF<br />\ndiscriminatory not to provide<br />\ngynecological care and access to<br />\ncontraceptive services \"because the one<br />\nfundamental difference between men and<br />\nwomen is in regard to their reproductive<br />\nroles and health care needs. If female<br />\nstudents don't get help through the college<br />\nhealth service, they have to purchase it<br />\nthrough a private 'physician or incur health<br />\nand pregnancy risks.\"<br />\nThe fact is, most college women need<br />\naccess to birth control services. According<br />\nto the Commission on Population Growth<br /><br />\nand the American Future, nearly half of<br />\nthe unmarried women in the United States<br />\nhave had sexual intercourse by age 19. The<br />\npicture, however, is not one of \"rampant<br />\nsexuality among the sexually<br />\nexperienced,\" but of greatly misinformed<br />\nwomen with vague ideas about how<br />\npregnancy occurs and the use of<br />\ncontraception.<br />\nIn the past, schools have generally<br />\ntreated sex-related health needs as a<br />\nseparate medical need, outside the realm<br />\nof their responsibility to wpmen on<br />\ncampus. And although women students<br />\nusually pay their schools a separate charge<br />\nfor health care, most have had no<br />\nalternative but to rely on a private<br />\nphysician for gynecological care and<br />\ncontraceptive advice, resulting in<br />\nadditional costs to the student.<br />\nWith increasingly liberal attitudes<br />\ntoward visitation,. coed dorms and<br />\ncohabitation, more schools are including<br />\nbirth control clinics in their health<br />\nservices. Some schools, however, are still<br />\nfighting against the dissemination of<br />\ncontraceptive advice on their campuses.<br />\nRecently the Board of Regents of<br />\nArizona State University(ASU)forbid the<br />\ncampus health service from giving family<br />\nplanning counselling and birth control<br />\ndevices to students. The Regents' decision<br />\nis now being contested in court, but<br />\nmeanwhile women students are shuttled<br />\noff to the local Planned Parenthood which<br />\nsees an average of 35 patients a day.<br />\n\"Sixty percent are students and more than<br />\nhalf of that figure a're ASU students,\" one<br />\nworker there said.<br />\nThe attitude of the Regents, according<br />\nto the Student Association President of<br /><br />\nASU is well reflected in an editorial that<br />\nappeared in the Arizona Republic. \"The<br />\npublic education system does not need to<br />\nadd a function designed to bail out<br />\nstudents whose frolicsome sexual freedom<br />\nis pursued with abandon, often with sad<br />\nresults. Now is the time for them to learn<br />\non their own the costs of promiscuity, and<br />\nto either use common sense or pay.\"<br />\nEven those who do use common sense<br />\nend up paying. Although birth control is<br />\noffered on many more campuses now than<br />\never before, women students are often<br />\nexpected to support such services with<br />\nmoney in addition to their regular health<br />\ncare fees. At the University of California<br />\nat Davis, students interested in getting<br />\ncontraceptives through their health service<br />\nwill pay $17.50 a visit not including the<br />\ncost of the device itself. The $17.50 will<br />\nhave to be paid before an appointment at<br />\nthe clinic can be made. The fee is<br />\nnecessary, state officials claim,because the<br />\nhealth service fees from students are<br />\ndesignated only for the treatment of<br />\n\"acute or sub-acute\" conditions.<br />\nWomen students pay in other ways, too.<br />\nMany have to wait two or three months to<br />\nset up an appointment with a gynecologist<br />\nthrough the health service. At Washington<br />\nUniversity in St. Louis, there is one<br />\ngynecologist for 5000 female students.<br />\nThe health service at Washington U will<br />\ntake care of emergency gynecological<br />\nproblems right away but as the<br />\ngynecological nurse explained, \"We can't<br />\nconsider a request for birth control as an<br />\nemergency. We hate to tell women they<br />\nhave to wait .an extra month and they<br />\ndon't like to hear it, but there is nothing<br />\nwe can do.\"<br /><br />\nDANCE<br />\nMARATHON<br />\nFINALS<br /><br />\n3,1,,E,M7MME,QT/1,11<br /><br />\npage 10/newA-letter/november 14, 1975<br /><br />\n9:30PM Friday to 12:00 Noon Sunday<br />\nThe Glass Pavillion<br />\nJohns Hopkins Union<br /><br />\nDon't Miss It!<br /><br />\nclassifieds<br />\nLOST NECKLACE Silver bead,<br />\ncoral, hishi, necklace.

A pass intended for Blue Jay<br />\nforward Greg Cunningham had been<br />\nknocked down by the hands of a Green<br />\nTerror defenseman in the penalty area to<br />\nset up this opportunity.<br />\nComeback<br />\nBlue Jay midfielder Bob Teasdale, out<br />\nof the line-up for several games because of<br />\na leg injury, made a successful return to<br />\naction by scoring the game's second goal.<br />\nTeasdale rifled a shot from 18 yards out<br />\npast the visiting netrninder to give the<br /><br />\nCoach Oliver ..\u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\nCatalyst in a winning formula<br />\nBy DAVID ICRAUS<br />\nThe stunning success of this year's Blue<br />\nJay varsity soccer team should be<br />\nattributed primarily to one man\u2014Coach<br />\nRobert Oliver.<br />\nNow in his fifth year of guiding the<br />\nHopkins booters, Coach Oliver has had<br />\nmany disappointing moments in his<br />\nprevious four seasons. Each of those<br />\nsquads had finished with a won-lost record<br />\nof about .500 or less and many observers<br />\nexpected a similar performance from this<br />\nyear's team.<br />\nHowever, armed with his rich soccer<br />\nbackground and coaching philosophy,<br />\nOliver has been the catalyst in leading the<br />\nBlue Jays to a 12-14 regular season mark,<br />\nan MAC sectional championship and an<br />\nNCAA tournament bid.<br />\nBob Oliver was born, raised and has<br />\nlived his entire life here in Baltimore. He<br />\nPlayed high school soccer at City College<br />\nand continued the sport when he attended<br />\nTowson State Teachers College.<br />\nWhile at Towson, he played under Doc<br />\nMinnegan\u2014a man Oliver considers not<br />\nOnly the \"finest fundamentalist around,\"<br />\nbut a man who was \"more than a<br />\ncoach\u2014he was a teacher and friend as<br />\nwell.\"<br />\nDuring his years of varsity competition<br />\nunder Minnegan as both a wing and a<br />\nhalfback, Oliver did not play in a losing<br />\ngame.<br />\nUpon graduation, Oliver went back to<br />\nteach at his alma mater\u2014City College. He<br />\nwanted to continue in soccer, but hadn't<br />\ndecided whether to go into coaching or<br />\nOfficiating. Ken Van Sant, Athletic<br />\nDirector at City College \u2022at the time,<br />\ninfluenced the decision by offering Oliver<br /><br />\nthe opportunity to coach the JV soccer<br />\nteam\u2014an opportunity he immediately<br />\nseized.<br />\n\"It was a blessing,\" the Blue Jay mentor<br />\nrecalls, adding quickly, \"although I've had<br />\nmany second thoughts about coaching<br />\nmany times since.\"<br />\nOliver became varsity coach two years<br />\nlater and remained at City until 1966. In<br />\nthat year, he took a similar post at Mt. St.<br />\nJoe\u2014a position he held until coming to<br />\nHopkins in the summer of 1971.<br />\n\"They expressed an interest in me,\" the<br />\ncoach commented when asked how he<br />\nbecame associated with the job here at<br />\nHomewood. \"Marshall Turner, who was<br />\nthen the Athletic Director, called me, I<br />\ncame for an interview and the job was<br />\nmine.<br />\n\"My job was not to make Hopkins an<br />\nimmediate winner\u2014it was just to try and<br />\nupgrade the program.\"<br />\nUpon arriving at Homewood Coach<br />\nOliver began to evaluate the material and<br />\nprepare for the future.<br />\n\"Of the players that were here,\" that he<br />\nrecalls, \"the interest was there, but<br />\nsomething was lacking.<br />\nSoccer wasn't a big part of their<br />\nHopkins life.\"<br />\n\"I had a design in mind. I saw it as a<br />\nchallenge to try to turn it around. It<br />\nwould take patience and time, but it<br />\nwould be a lot better when I finished that<br />\nwhen I started.\"<br />\nThe new coach began to recruit local<br />\nsoccer talent .to feather the Blue Jays nest.<br />\nAmong his first recruits were Lou<br />\nPodrazik and Joe Rutkowski\u2014integral<br />\nmembers of this year's team.<br />\nHowever, Oliver did not look at players<br /><br />\nfor any particular place on the field.<br />\n\"There are basically two positions,\"<br />\naccording to Oliver. \"Goalie and the rest<br />\nof them.\"<br />\nAmong the 'rest of them', Coach Oliver<br />\nfeels that the \"midfield is my biggest<br />\nbaby\u2014they can make a line go. Deep backs<br />\nhave to have a lot of savvy and must<br />\nknow how to read the game, while strikers<br />\ncocky and<br />\nare flamboyant,<br />\nself-centered\u2014all positive qualities to<br />\nsucceed there.\"<br />\nQuestioned about whether or not he has<br />\n-accomplished in his tenure here what he<br />\nhad hoped to, Coach Oliver replied,<br />\n\"Yes\u2014more and less. But, it's not over yet.<br />\nNothing in athletics is ever finished.\"<br />\nHe admits though that he likes the<br />\nfuture of soccer here at Homewood.<br />\n\"The immediate prospects are bright,\"<br />\nhe said. \"We lose just four people to<br />\ngraduation this year.\"<br /><br />\nHomewood swimmers to<br />\nmake debut this evening<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nHomewood aquatic fans can catch their<br />\nfirst glimpse of the 1975-76 Hopkins swim<br />\nteam tonight when Coach Frank<br />\nComfort's charges conduct the 2nd<br />\nAnnual Hopkins Draft meet at 7:30 p.m.<br />\nin Homewood pool.<br />\nBlues vs. Jays<br />\nBoth the squad and the coaching staff<br />\nwill be evenly split in half with the<br />\n\"Blues\" opposing the \"Jays\" and Coach<br />\nComfort acting as \"commissioner\".<br /><br />\nGridders look to bring record up to .500<br />\nBy STEVE HAAS<br />\nMotivated by the possibility of salvaging<br />\na .500 season even with all the misfortune<br />\nwhich has befallen them thus far, the<br />\nHopkins football team travels to Carlisle,<br />\nPennsylvania tomorrow to battle<br />\nDickinson College in this year's edition of<br />\nthe annual divisional football rivalry.<br />\n\"If we can win the game with Dickinson<br />\nSaturday and beat Western Maryland next<br />\nweek,\" hypothesized Hopkins coach<br />\nDennis Cox,\"then we'llfinish 4-4-1 for the<br />\nseason and 4-2-1 in the division, which<br />\nisn't too bad considering the problems<br />\nwe've had.\"<br />\nBoth teams enter the contest with<br />\nsimilar problems. As Cox observed,\"They<br />\ndon't have a whole lot of kids and they've<br />\nhad a lot of injuries. Most of their players<br />\nare the same size as ours.\" Dickinson head<br />\ncoach Wilbur Gobrecht, now in his<br />\neleventh season at the helm, could easily<br />\nhave made the same synopsis of the Blue<br />\nJays.<br />\nFullback John Coad is expected to be<br /><br />\nthe only Blue Jay player to miss this game,<br />\nas numerous players have finally recovered<br />\nsufficiently to return to full-time action.<br />\nDickinson, with a record of 2-5-1 after<br />\ntheir victory over Ursinus last week, and<br />\nHopkins both showed a complete absence<br />\nfrom among the leaders in this week's<br />\nleague statistics.<br />\nTeam statistics give indications of an<br />\noffensive edge for the Blue Jays and<br />\ndefensive advantage to the Red Devils, but<br />\nneither margin is significantly impressive.<br />\nOffensively, Hopkins averages 305 total<br />\nyards per game, while their opponents<br />\nsport a 270-yard average. The Blue Jays<br />\naverage a 19-yard edge in rushing and<br />\npassing per game, but these are not truly<br />\nindicative of what the game will be like.<br />\nKey Threat<br />\nJim Gerlach is the leading running back<br />\nfor the Red Devils and is the key to their<br />\noffense. \"We have to stop Gerlach to win<br />\nthe game,\" indicated Cox.<br />\nThe recent emergence of the one-two<br />\noffensive punch of Brett Miles rushing and<br /><br />\nHomewood Booters a 2-0 halftime lead.<br />\n. Rutkowski also closed the scoring just<br />\neight minutes into the second forty-five<br />\nminutes as he fired another penalty kick<br />\ninto the net. This chance arose when a<br />\nTeasdale head shot, moving towards an<br />\nopen corner of the goal, was punched out<br />\nin desperation by a Western Maryland<br />\ndefenseman.<br />\nThe Jays continued their offensive<br />\nassault for the rest of the game, although<br />\nthey could not add to their 3-0 advantage.<br />\nThe Green Terror goalie was mainly<br />\nresponsible for this, racking up 15 saves by<br />\ngames end.<br />\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the<br />\nfield, Homewood netminder Ken Seuess<br />\nwas forced to make only four saves en<br />\nroute to his seventh shutout of the season.<br />\n\"It's a game we totally dominated,\" was<br />\nthe way Hopkins Coach Bob Oliver<br />\nevaluated his team's effort.<br />\nI Bench Strength<br />\n\"When you shoot that many times(the<br />\nJays had 39 shots), it's a good sign,\" the<br />\ncoach continued. \"We would have had<br />\nmore goals, but their keeper made some<br />\nfine plays.\"<br />\nOliver was also pleased with the way his<br />\nreserves were able to contribute.<br />\n\"Cazzy (Bruce Cazenave) did an<br />\noutstanding job coming in,\" the Blue Jay<br />\nmentor noted. \"It's important that<br />\nsomeone can come off the bench and do<br />\nthe job for us.\"<br />\nIn the preliminary game, the Hopkins<br />\nJ.V. squad downed their Western<br />\nMaryland counterparts by a similar score<br />\nof 3-0. Jaime Reynafarje, Barry Altman<br />\nand John Hall scored for the Junior Jays<br />\nwho finished their season with a record of<br />\n4-4-2.<br /><br />\nTom Bender passing has made the Blue<br />\nJays a more viable threat to move the ball<br />\nconsistently and score often. \"The team<br />\nnow has confidence in Bender. If we<br />\ncontinue to score as often as we have, we<br />\nshouldn't have too many problems,\" Cox<br />\nobserved.<br />\nNullified<br />\nOutscoring the Dickinson offense 19-15<br />\nper game on the average, Hopkins has<br />\nmore than nullified the Devils' advantage<br />\non defense. The Blue Jay defense<br />\noutyields the Red Devils 35-23 on the<br />\nscoreboard and surrenders 55 more yards<br />\nper game. As Cox diplomatically states,<br />\n\"We know our defense is going to give up<br />\npoints. We just expect them to do their best<br />\nand we try to outscore them.\"<br />\nWith the possibility of attaining a .500<br />\nseason on the line, even after suffering<br />\nfrequent hampering injuries and enduring<br />\ncrushing defeats to Franklin and Marshall<br />\nand Towson State, the newly-adopted<br />\nHopkins option defense should be in full<br />\ngear for the key encounter tomorrow.<br /><br />\n\"We started this last year,\" said<br />\nComfort, \"and it turned out to be<br />\nsuper\u2014just fantastic for team morale. This<br />\nmeet will include everyone in our<br />\nprogram: men, women, B team; all evenly<br />\nsplit. We'll score all six places and all four<br />\nrelays with myself and Coach Cordin<br />\n(diving coach) acting at commissioners.\"<br />\nThe success of the Hopkins swimming<br />\nprogram during Comfort's reign is<br />\nwell-known. The Comforteers finished<br />\nsecond in Division III last year and have<br />\nranked in the top ten for each of the past<br />\nfive years.<br />\nWhen asked for an early season preview<br />\nof this year's group of Blue Jay poolmen<br />\n(and women!) Comfort singled out the<br />\nreturn of three Division III All-Americans:<br />\nsenior Bob Schwenkler in the free sprints,<br />\nand a pair of juniors, backstroker John<br />\nDierkes and 1?reaststroker Rick Goodale.<br />\nAquawomen<br />\n\"Also this year we have the best<br />\nfreshman class since I've been here at<br />\nHopkins and our diving this year will be<br />\nour strongest event!\"<br />\nFor the first time, Comfort will operate<br />\na women's team as well as varsity and<br />\njunior varsity squads. As far as the<br />\npossibility of women swimming in varsity<br />\nmeets, the Hopkins mentor was<br />\nunequivocally positive.<br />\n\"Of course they'll swim if they<br />\nqualify,\" Comfort stated. \"We're training<br />\nswimmers here,not men or women!\"<br />\n\"We're a very, very young team this<br />\nyear,\" Comfort concluded, \"and that<br />\ncould lead to us making mistakes. But<br />\noverall I'd say that this is the best<br />\nchampionship team we've ever had and<br />\nconsidering the fact that we've been in the<br />\ntop ten for five consecutive years, that's<br />\nquite an accomplishment!\"<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nmeetings<br />\nCHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP<br />\nAll students are invited to participate in<br />\nBible Studies sponsored by the Hopkins<br />\nChristian Fellowship this and every Sunday in<br />\nConference Room A of the Student Union.<br />\nThis Sunday, Zomaya Soloman, Director, Bible<br />\nInstitute, Arlington Baptist Church, will be our<br />\nguest in leading the study.
