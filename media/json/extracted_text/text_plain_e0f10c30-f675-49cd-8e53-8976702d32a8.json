XX, NO. 12.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., JANUARY 17, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Ira Remsen, president emeritus of Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nSpoke at the annual banquet of the<br />\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers last Thursday evening on<br />\nthe necessity of keeping the spirit<br />\nof research alive in America.<br />\nDr. Remsen said that he was in<br />\nGermany at the time of the birth<br />\nof the new chemical era, and had<br />\nWitnessed the inauguration of the<br />\nnewer chemical industries which are<br />\nnow playing such an important part<br />\nin the war.<br />\n\"Liebig,\" Dr. Remsen said, \"was<br />\nthe father of the movement. It was<br />\nhe who taught Germany that the<br />\nknowledge of science and the spirit<br />\nof investigation were essential to the<br />\nwelfare of industry.\"<br />\n\"To promote its industrial industries,\" Dr. Remsen proceeded,\"Germany had taken men out of its<br />\nuniversities to head its great concerns, and the success of those concerns had been the proof of the<br />\nWisdom of Germany's policy.\"<br />\nDr. Remsen went on to say that<br />\nthis country needs the things which<br />\nGermany has won as the result of<br />\nthis policy. The recent address of<br />\nPresident Perkins, of the English<br />\nChemical Society, showed that England is suffering for them, and<br />\nalthough the United States is in a<br />\nbetter condition than England in regard to chemical education and<br />\ntraining, this country still has much<br />\nto learn.<br />\n\"The word 'research,'\" Dr. Remsen continued, \"has been much<br />\nabused in America, especially in<br />\nschools and colleges. And in the<br />\nschools and colleges it is a sham.<br />\nNo one can do true research work<br />\nuntil he puts his whole body and<br />\nsoul into it. It requires and demands everything there is in a man.<br />\nIt is impossible in colleges for students to do 'original research work,'<br />\nbecause their energies are necessarily dissipated in the study of<br />\nseveral subjects. There is a great<br />\ndeal of humbug in our so-called research work. But we are improving tremendously. We must get<br />\nthe true spirit into the right men<br />\nand then place these men in the<br />\nlead. We have a long road to travel<br />\nbefore we attain the real goal, but<br />\nWe are on the right road and we<br />\nare traveling.\"<br />\nThe convention inspected several<br />\nPlants, both in this city and in Annapolis, during the three days it<br />\nwas in session.

It was<br />\nProfessor Reid's first trip to the<br />\nCanal Zone and he said he was<br />\nmuch interested in the canal work<br />\nand in the geological formations<br />\nthat were encountered.<br />\n<br />\nThe Cotillon Board is making<br />\nelaborate preparations for the second of the series of formal dances,<br />\nwhich will be held on Friday night,<br />\nFebruary 4, in McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe music, which will be furnished by Louis Fischer\"s orchestra, has been given special attention. The program will include<br />\ntwenty dances, in addition to the<br />\nusual encores.

Following the call for tenors sent out a<br />\nweek ago, a large number of competent men reported for practice,<br />\nand with this gap filled, work on the<br />\nmusic went ahead at a rate far exceeding anything yet attained this<br />\nyear. With the addition of one or<br />\ntwo numbers to the repertoire thus<br />\nfar gained, the club will be in excellent shape. .<br />\nThe Mandolin Club, while not as<br />\nfar advanced in its work as the<br />\nsingers, still looks promising, and<br />\nwith more frequent rehearsal from<br />\nnow on will show results. The fact<br />\nthat many of the instrumentalists<br />\nare at Homewood this year has<br />\nmade it difficult to systematize the<br />\norganization, but this trouble once<br />\nout of the way a short time will suffice for the perfection of the program.

The repertoire of the clubs<br />\nincludes a variety of numbers which<br />\nwould be hard to duplicate; the aim<br />\nhas been to satisfy, as far as possible, all kinds of musical taste, and<br />\nthe public is assured by the management that there will be something<br />\non the bill to suit everybody.<br />\nThe committee in charge of the<br />\nMcCoy Hall Concert announces that<br />\nundergraduate students will be<br />\ngiven the privilege of buying a<br />\n\"blue ticket\" which may be exchanged for two reserved seats, and<br />\nwhich will sell for $1.50. This reduction is being made as an effort<br />\nto increase the attendance of students as much as possible, and, if<br />\nenough undergraduates take advantage of it to justify its continuance, it will be offered as a feature<br />\nof succeeding concerts. Each undergraduate will be allowed to buy<br />\none ticket.<br />\nOther concert engagements have<br />\nbeen arranged and the schedule is<br />\nfast assuming its final shape. One<br />\nor two trips, details of which will be<br />\nannounced shortly, will be taken.<br />\nThe musicians have a promising<br />\nfield in which to do their work, and<br />\nif they continue at their present rate<br />\nof progress their chances for success are unlimited.<br />\nThe custom of having the freshmen wear distinctive hats is an innovation this year at Missouri.\u2014Ex.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, JANUARY 17,<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\n<br />\nTRIANGULAR DEBATE TO BE HELD<br />\n<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

Mr. Tingley was elected to a position On the<br />\nboard in his junior year, and was<br />\nalways faithful and efficient in the<br />\nperformance of his duties.. He has<br />\nfound it necessary to give up his<br />\nplace on Tilt Ntws-LETTER on account of pressure of work on the<br />\ndebating teams and on the 1916<br />\nHullabaloo, of which he is editorin-chief.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER wishes Mr.<br />\nTingley the best of good fortune<br />\nin his work on the Hullabaloo.<br />\nThink of the Future!<br />\n<br />\nThe time is at hand when the<br />\ndirectors of the activities of late<br />\nwinter and early spring are taking<br />\nup their work in earnest, striving<br />\nwith their charges for a worthy representation on athletic field, concert<br />\nstage and debating platform. Their<br />\nwork is at present in the formative<br />\nperiod of its development; faults are<br />\nbeing corrected, good points rounded out, and a\u2022systematic procedure<br />\nalong lines most conducive to success is being sought. And for this<br />\nwork, men are needed.<br />\nWe must bear in mind that if the<br />\n<br />\nteams and clubs which promise to<br />\nrepresent Johns Hopkins with flying colors this year are to continue<br />\ntheir work in years to come, material must be put into shape to take<br />\nup the places of those men who<br />\nmust be lost by graduation. Our<br />\nlacrosse squad gives promise of<br />\nturning out a championship team<br />\nthis year, but Coach Wolfe has announced that unless a larger delegation from the freshman class<br />\ncomes out, the chances for a winning team next year and the years<br />\nfollowing are not good at all. The<br />\nbaseball team, musical clubs, and debating teams all have men enough<br />\non their lists of candidates to carry<br />\nthem through this season with the<br />\nexpected success, but as matters<br />\nstand now none can boast that its<br />\nneeds will be definitely provided for<br />\nduring the next few years. The<br />\nstanding of future student organizations depends on the spirit with<br />\nwhich the under-classmen of today<br />\nundertake to train themselves to fill<br />\npositions which will be left open for<br />\njuniors and seniors of tomorrow.<br />\nMen thoroughly qualified to take<br />\nup this work are not made in a day,<br />\nnor are they endowed by Providence with the ability to take up<br />\ntheir-duties without sincere preparatory work. Their powers must be<br />\ndeveloped by dint of persevering<br />\napplication to the task of learning their part in the line of work<br />\nwhich they have chosen to follow,<br />\nand they can combine to make up an<br />\neffective unit only when they have<br />\nfollowed such a course. The<br />\n\"green\" freshman with only a<br />\nmoderate amount of natural ability<br />\nwho chooses his activity, enlists in<br />\nits work, and, without scattering his<br />\nenergy, puts himself to the task of<br />\nmastering its details, sticking to it<br />\nuntil results show, is more than apt<br />\nto be the man who will be ready<br />\nwhen occasion demands an efficient<br />\nplayer to fill a position on his team.<br />\nNow, then, is the time for freshmen to begin their training. Many<br />\na college man reaches his senior<br />\nyear with the regret that he did not<br />\nenter into some activity as an under-classman, realizing to his sorrow that it is too late to do anything worth while. Under-classmen, you can avoid such a predicament by deciding now to amount to<br />\nsomething in the .activity best suited to your personal ability. Choose<br />\nyour work, give it your energy, and<br />\nstick to it!<br />\n<br />\nALUMNI NOTES<br />\nRecent Appointments.<br />\n<br />\nMary E. Armstrong, Ph. D.

The first real scrimmage<br />\nof the season was held in the cage<br />\non last Saturday, and although it<br />\nshowed that much work must be<br />\ndone before the team can take the<br />\nfield, still it was an excellent practice for so ear:y in the season. The<br />\ncoaches have their eyes especially<br />\non the new men. There are several<br />\nvery promising freshmen who have<br />\neven chances of making the team<br />\nand supplanting men who played<br />\nlast year.<br />\nThose out for the team are : Paul<br />\nSutton (captain), F.

Smith<br />\nand Stanley Clark.<br />\n<br />\nChicago, Ill., Dr. Knight Dunlap,<br />\nan associate professor of psychology at Johns Hopkins, exhibited a<br />\nchronoscope of his own invention.<br />\nThe instrument is used in an association reaction experiment, which<br />\nis performed in the following manner: The experimenter says a word,<br />\nand, as the air waves caused by his<br />\nvoice make a plate vibrate, an electrical connection is broken and a<br />\nclock starts. When the subject replies, another plate is set vibrating,<br />\nand, making a connection, stops the<br />\nclock. The object of the experiment is to find the length of time<br />\nit takes for different kinds of associations of ideas to form. For<br />\ninstance, it can be found whether<br />\nit takes longer for an adjective or<br />\na verb to suggest itself when a<br />\nnoun is spoken. The chronoscope<br />\nmeasures time to one-thousandth of<br />\na second.<br />\nThis apparatus, which is the first<br />\nof its kind, met with great approval<br />\nat the Chicago convention, and orders for duplicates have been given<br />\nby many of the leading universities<br />\nof the country. The chronoscopes<br />\nwill be made in the Johns Hopkins<br />\npsychological laboratory.<br />\nUNIVERSITY DIRECTORY<br />\n<br />\nlege, Chestertown.

The recent address of<br />\nPresident Perkins, of the English<br />\nChemical Society, showed that England is suffering for them, and<br />\nalthough the United States is in a<br />\nbetter condition than England in regard to chemical education and<br />\ntraining, this country still has much<br />\nto learn.<br />\n\"The word 'research,'\" Dr. Remsen continued, \"has been much<br />\nabused in America, especially in<br />\nschools and colleges. And in the<br />\nschools and colleges it is a sham.<br />\nNo one can do true research work<br />\nuntil he puts his whole body and<br />\nsoul into it. It requires and demands everything there is in a man.<br />\nIt is impossible in colleges for students to do 'original research work,'<br />\nbecause their energies are necessarily dissipated in the study of<br />\nseveral subjects.

The<br />\nadditional amount necessary for<br />\nbuilding the pool is to be raised<br />\namong the graduates.\u2014Ex.<br /><br />\nTenors Respond to Call Made by Glee<br />\nClub\u2014Special Rate Offered to Undergraduates for McCoy Hall Concert.<br /><br />\nThe Glee Club made rapid progress during the past week. Following the call for tenors sent out a<br />\nweek ago, a large number of competent men reported for practice,<br />\nand with this gap filled, work on the<br />\nmusic went ahead at a rate far exceeding anything yet attained this<br />\nyear. With the addition of one or<br />\ntwo numbers to the repertoire thus<br />\nfar gained, the club will be in excellent shape. .<br />\nThe Mandolin Club, while not as<br />\nfar advanced in its work as the<br />\nsingers, still looks promising, and<br />\nwith more frequent rehearsal from<br />\nnow on will show results. The fact<br />\nthat many of the instrumentalists<br />\nare at Homewood this year has<br />\nmade it difficult to systematize the<br />\norganization, but this trouble once<br />\nout of the way a short time will suffice for the perfection of the program. Affairs ill general are picking up at a rapid rate.<br />\nThe musicians are bending all of<br />\ntheir efforts toward making the big<br />\nconcert in McCoy Hall a success.<br />\nA tentative program recently compiled by the director shows that it<br />\nwill be the snappiest concert of its<br />\nkind given at Hopkins in many<br />\nyears. The repertoire of the clubs<br />\nincludes a variety of numbers which<br />\nwould be hard to duplicate; the aim<br />\nhas been to satisfy, as far as possible, all kinds of musical taste, and<br />\nthe public is assured by the management that there will be something<br />\non the bill to suit everybody.<br />\nThe committee in charge of the<br />\nMcCoy Hall Concert announces that<br />\nundergraduate students will be<br />\ngiven the privilege of buying a<br />\n\"blue ticket\" which may be exchanged for two reserved seats, and<br />\nwhich will sell for $1.50. This reduction is being made as an effort<br />\nto increase the attendance of students as much as possible, and, if<br />\nenough undergraduates take advantage of it to justify its continuance, it will be offered as a feature<br />\nof succeeding concerts. Each undergraduate will be allowed to buy<br />\none ticket.<br />\nOther concert engagements have<br />\nbeen arranged and the schedule is<br />\nfast assuming its final shape. One<br />\nor two trips, details of which will be<br />\nannounced shortly, will be taken.<br />\nThe musicians have a promising<br />\nfield in which to do their work, and<br />\nif they continue at their present rate<br />\nof progress their chances for success are unlimited.<br />\nThe custom of having the freshmen wear distinctive hats is an innovation this year at Missouri.\u2014Ex.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, JANUARY 17,<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br /><br />\nTRIANGULAR DEBATE TO BE HELD<br /><br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

Mr. Tingley was elected to a position On the<br />\nboard in his junior year, and was<br />\nalways faithful and efficient in the<br />\nperformance of his duties.. He has<br />\nfound it necessary to give up his<br />\nplace on Tilt Ntws-LETTER on account of pressure of work on the<br />\ndebating teams and on the 1916<br />\nHullabaloo, of which he is editorin-chief.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER wishes Mr.<br />\nTingley the best of good fortune<br />\nin his work on the Hullabaloo.<br />\nThink of the Future!<br /><br />\nThe time is at hand when the<br />\ndirectors of the activities of late<br />\nwinter and early spring are taking<br />\nup their work in earnest, striving<br />\nwith their charges for a worthy representation on athletic field, concert<br />\nstage and debating platform. Their<br />\nwork is at present in the formative<br />\nperiod of its development; faults are<br />\nbeing corrected, good points rounded out, and a\u2022systematic procedure<br />\nalong lines most conducive to success is being sought. And for this<br />\nwork, men are needed.<br />\nWe must bear in mind that if the<br /><br />\nteams and clubs which promise to<br />\nrepresent Johns Hopkins with flying colors this year are to continue<br />\ntheir work in years to come, material must be put into shape to take<br />\nup the places of those men who<br />\nmust be lost by graduation. Our<br />\nlacrosse squad gives promise of<br />\nturning out a championship team<br />\nthis year, but Coach Wolfe has announced that unless a larger delegation from the freshman class<br />\ncomes out, the chances for a winning team next year and the years<br />\nfollowing are not good at all. The<br />\nbaseball team, musical clubs, and debating teams all have men enough<br />\non their lists of candidates to carry<br />\nthem through this season with the<br />\nexpected success, but as matters<br />\nstand now none can boast that its<br />\nneeds will be definitely provided for<br />\nduring the next few years. The<br />\nstanding of future student organizations depends on the spirit with<br />\nwhich the under-classmen of today<br />\nundertake to train themselves to fill<br />\npositions which will be left open for<br />\njuniors and seniors of tomorrow.<br />\nMen thoroughly qualified to take<br />\nup this work are not made in a day,<br />\nnor are they endowed by Providence with the ability to take up<br />\ntheir-duties without sincere preparatory work. Their powers must be<br />\ndeveloped by dint of persevering<br />\napplication to the task of learning their part in the line of work<br />\nwhich they have chosen to follow,<br />\nand they can combine to make up an<br />\neffective unit only when they have<br />\nfollowed such a course. The<br />\n\"green\" freshman with only a<br />\nmoderate amount of natural ability<br />\nwho chooses his activity, enlists in<br />\nits work, and, without scattering his<br />\nenergy, puts himself to the task of<br />\nmastering its details, sticking to it<br />\nuntil results show, is more than apt<br />\nto be the man who will be ready<br />\nwhen occasion demands an efficient<br />\nplayer to fill a position on his team.<br />\nNow, then, is the time for freshmen to begin their training. Many<br />\na college man reaches his senior<br />\nyear with the regret that he did not<br />\nenter into some activity as an under-classman, realizing to his sorrow that it is too late to do anything worth while. Under-classmen, you can avoid such a predicament by deciding now to amount to<br />\nsomething in the .activity best suited to your personal ability. Choose<br />\nyour work, give it your energy, and<br />\nstick to it!<br /><br />\nALUMNI NOTES<br />\nRecent Appointments.<br /><br />\nMary E. Armstrong, Ph. D.

In addition to this there<br />\nare chapters devoted to the discussion of boycott on materials and<br />\ncommodities, on the mechanism of<br />\nthe boycott, and on the law and the<br />\nboycott.

The first real scrimmage<br />\nof the season was held in the cage<br />\non last Saturday, and although it<br />\nshowed that much work must be<br />\ndone before the team can take the<br />\nfield, still it was an excellent practice for so ear:y in the season. The<br />\ncoaches have their eyes especially<br />\non the new men. There are several<br />\nvery promising freshmen who have<br />\neven chances of making the team<br />\nand supplanting men who played<br />\nlast year.<br />\nThose out for the team are : Paul<br />\nSutton (captain), F.

When the subject replies, another plate is set vibrating,<br />\nand, making a connection, stops the<br />\nclock. The object of the experiment is to find the length of time<br />\nit takes for different kinds of associations of ideas to form. For<br />\ninstance, it can be found whether<br />\nit takes longer for an adjective or<br />\na verb to suggest itself when a<br />\nnoun is spoken. The chronoscope<br />\nmeasures time to one-thousandth of<br />\na second.<br />\nThis apparatus, which is the first<br />\nof its kind, met with great approval<br />\nat the Chicago convention, and orders for duplicates have been given<br />\nby many of the leading universities<br />\nof the country. The chronoscopes<br />\nwill be made in the Johns Hopkins<br />\npsychological laboratory.<br />\nUNIVERSITY DIRECTORY<br /><br />\nlege, Chestertown.

Most of<br />\nthe loss is impossible of estimate,<br />\nsince the old books and documents<br />\npertaining to the founding of the<br />\ncollege in 1783 cannot be replaced.<br />\nThe fire, which was discovered<br />\nby a student, made such headway<br />\nthat attempts on the part of the faculty and students to get in and save<br />\nthings were almost useless. Within<br />\ntwo hours after the discovery of<br />\nthe fire, the building was in ruins.<br />\nThe question of closing the college, all of which were centered in<br />\nheat and water supply, as well as<br />\nthe library and records of the college, all of which were stored in<br />\nthe burned structure, out of commission, it will be found difficult<br />\nto continue work.
