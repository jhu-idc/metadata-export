A Brooks Brothers suit<br />\nwill work wonders, although that might<br />\nseem a bit in con grous along a rural route.<br />\nThe male hiker should try to look like a<br />\ncombination of Andy Hardy and Robert<br />\nRedflltd.<br />\nOr ner<br />\nher, nothing is more priceless than a set<br />\n<br />\nof Villager Clothes, a well-scrubed Julie<br />\nAndrews appearance never hurts. Blue<br />\njeans affect different people in different<br />\nways, and you never know....<br />\nMoreover, a hitcher should be aware of<br />\nthe potential power of the various forms<br />\nof exterior identification. A jacket that<br />\nhas the word \"Yale\" written on it is<br />\ninvaluable to the hitcher, for then liberals<br />\n<br />\nwill associate the word with Bobby Seale<br />\nand William Sloan Coffin, while<br />\nconservatives will think, \"How nice, and<br />\nIvy Leaguer.\"<br />\nOnce the hitchhiker has his ride, a<br />\nwhole new set of difficulties must be<br />\nfaced. Unless the traveler is extremely<br />\nconfident in his ride possiblities, he is<br />\nforced to grasp at the first ride that<br />\ncomes along. Sometimes this can be a bad<br />\nthing. A southern friend of mine, hitching<br />\nthrough rural Tennessee, was picked up<br />\nby a farmer in a pickup truck. The<br />\nstudent had to share the flatbed part with<br />\nfifty crated-up chickens. Poor fellow, he<br />\nsmelled like Sunday dinner until<br />\nbreakfast time.<br />\nJust last week, another acquaintance of<br />\nmine was hitching home to Chevey Chase<br />\nfrom New Jersey for Thanksgiving. She<br />\nobtained a ride from a driver who assured<br />\nher that he was going to Washington, D.<br />\nC. But what he didn't say was that it was<br />\nby way of Hamilton, Ontario. People love<br />\ngames.<br />\nAt least once during his hitching career<br />\nthe traveller will have An Encounter. For<br />\nmen these experiences are of the<br />\nMidnight Cowboy variety. No less<br />\nunsettling is the female hitcher's<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nThe policeman also plays an ingiortant<br />\n<br />\nrole in the life of the hitchhiker. Almost<br />\nall states have some form of restrictioq<br />\nagainst thumbing, but enforcement is<br />\npretty much of a local matter. In<br />\nMaryland everything is ok as long as the<br />\nhiker stands on the curb.<br />\nIf you're going to go places, you gotta<br />\ngo places right-or you ain't going to go<br />\nno place at<br />\n<br />\nIt's not surprising<br />\nit's the same all over<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nVisiting old friends during<br />\nThanksgiving is almost as American as the<br />\nturkey itself. Trying to cram the last year<br />\ninto four hours of conversation is<br />\nimpossible, especially if you're trying to<br />\ndrink enough to get drunk. It's never<br />\ngood to try to do two things at the same<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe place was Hartford, the friends<br />\nwere old prep school pals, and the subject<br />\nmost often tossed around was college life.<br />\nHarvard, Yale, Ripon, Wheaton, and<br />\nSimmons (the good life) were<br />\nrepresented, and it was not too surprising<br />\nto learn that the schools suffer from the<br />\nsame ailments that Hopkins does.<br />\nThe host was from Harvard; he'd been<br />\nshoved into a Radcliff dorm, as the sister<br />\nschool wanted to liberate its students by<br />\nexposing them to members of the<br />\nopposite sex. I nearly went through the<br />\nroof when he told me of a mutual friend<br />\nhe met in the Square who had tumed<br />\nHare Krishma,\"shaved head and all.\"<br />\n\"Angus Murphy, can you believe it?\"<br />\nhe asked. Yup.<br />\nWhen I told him how free Hopkins<br />\nwas, he asked me how students<br />\nparticipated in making academic policy. I<br />\nwas embarrassed. I told him about the<br />\nAcademic Council, which holds its<br />\nmeetings like Russell Long does his<br />\n'Senate Finance Committee. \"You 're<br />\nkidding,\" he screamed, when I told him<br />\nnot a single student participated on the<br />\nAC. Harvard would never let that happen.<br />\nAt Yale,I'm led to believe the rich still<br />\nget richer, and the poor too, still get<br />\nricher. At one point, we re-lived the<br />\nHarvard-Yale game from which our token<br />\nbulldog had just returned. Whatever else<br />\nhas happened in New Haven and<br />\nCambridge during the last decade, the<br />\nrivalry is still there. The secret societies<br />\nare alive and well, too. The Eastern<br />\nEstablishment is here to stay.<br />\nRipon is a disaster area, and this chap<br />\nhas the worst case of collegiate anomie<br />\nI've ever seen. Wisconson, he says, is<br />\n<br />\nThe Academic Council's recent vote on the<br />\nintersesion recommendations of the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies (CUS) resulted in a change in<br />\nthe minimester Pass/Fail option, restricting the<br />\nchoice to formal course offerings, but otherwise<br />\nmaintained the present system. The Council's action<br />\nand the lack of proposals for changing the<br />\nintersession program, as reflected in the CUS<br />\nrecommendations should not be taken as indications<br />\nof satisfaction with the current system.<br />\nThe CUS prposals resulted from a study of<br />\nintersession conducted by a CUS subcommittee last<br />\nsemester. A list of suggested changes were compiled<br />\nfrom information collected from participants in last<br />\nJanuary's minimester. Suggestions included<br />\nrecommendations to hold a reading period before the<br />\nregular semester exams and to encourage departments<br />\nto investigate their intersession course offerings.<br />\nHowever, as the subcommittee's recommendations<br />\nwere considered - first by the CUS, then by the<br />\nAcademic Council, the proposals for change in the<br />\nsystem were either altered or deleted entirely,<br />\nproducing what appears to be a rote approval of the<br />\nentire minimester program. In the final estimation,<br />\nthe purpose of the lengthy interesession study was to<br />\nprovide recommendations for changing and upgrading<br />\nthe program. This objective was defeated somewhere<br />\nin the process.<br />\n<br />\nhardly a nice place to visit. He has a larger<br />\ncollection of new university catalogues<br />\nthan do most high school libraries. He'd<br />\nlike to go to law school some day, and as<br />\nwe walked thorugh Constitution Plaza's<br />\nChristmas display, he grilled me on the<br />\nPolitical Science and History departments<br />\nat Hopkins.

They tried to tell me<br />\nthat Spiro Agnew was the best governor<br />\nthe state ever had, and Baltimore was still<br />\nthe most disgusting city on the East<br />\nCoast. I tried to tell them Baltimore<br />\nwasn't that bad and that Spiro really was,<br />\nbut they turned off their hearing : aids.<br />\nThat might be a Republican trait. They<br />\nmissed a wonderfully lewd comment on<br />\nConnecticut's first GUY legislature- since<br />\nthe stone age.<br />\nIt was late, and they wanted to get<br />\nsome sleep, but they said they still<br />\ncouldn't figure out why I, with such long<br />\nhair, was wearing a three-piece suit. \"You<br />\nsure look like a Republican. underneath,\"<br />\nGrandma chuckled. I didn't have the<br />\nheart to tell her I really was.<br />\nThe six hippies concurred that we were<br />\nall still constipated from turkey, turkey,<br />\nturkey. As a group, we most certainly<br />\nwould have made a bad core of student<br />\nactivists. The only bumper sticker was on<br />\nthe Porsche, \"Apple Pie Makes You<br />\nSterile.\" On my way back to the Hop, I<br />\nbegan to to wonder if Porsches, Harvard,<br />\nYale, Hopkins, Ripon, Simmons, and<br />\nWheaton might not do the same.<br />\n<br />\nToday's gift is December.<br />\n<br />\nIt brings different things. Yesterday was the<br />\nstart of one of them, of something. My God,<br />\nit's started. Yesterday was only the beginning.<br />\nIjust know it.<br />\nthe sidewalk lakes<br />\nSoon there won't be time for our shoes to dry out.

The Gilman cone shop always wins over the reading room, and the<br />\nchairs near the magazines on A -level are too comfortable to leave.

I think this<br />\npremise is false, even insulting, but I'm<br />\nwriting princcipally to call critical<br />\nattention to sodium vapor lighting. These<br />\nhigh intensity lights cannot guarantee<br />\nsafety, are overly expensive, and<br />\nexceedingly hideous.<br />\nFor an urban campus, Homewood has<br />\n<br />\na particular charm and a distinct Georgian<br />\ngrace. While I hardly propose that we<br />\nrevert to gas lamps in order to match the<br />\ntone of the buildings and grounds, I<br />\nwould say a word in favor of the present<br />\nmercury vapor lights. They provide a<br />\nsensible, proportionate amount of light<br />\nwhen properly distributed. Why not<br />\npreserve a few quiet places on campus,<br />\nwhere one may walk and think with some<br />\nreasonable solitlude, where, on a warm<br />\nevening, we can get away and forget for a<br />\nmoment the asphalt, neon flashes, and<br />\nchain link fences of the city. There are<br />\nfew such escapes left. If we install sodium<br />\nvapor lights at Homewood we will have<br />\n<br />\nperpetual, horrid daylight: an Orwelllan<br />\nnightmare. Everything will be flooded in<br />\nthe pink glow of a railroad flare at a<br />\ndisaster scene. There are parts of the city<br />\nwhere this blinding glare is sadly<br />\nnecessary, but the Keyser quadrangle is<br />\nnot the Mt. Sinai Hospital parking lot.<br />\nSodium vapor lights would, in an<br />\nawsthetic sense, kill the campus to save it.<br />\nMy objections are not to a well-lighted<br />\ncampus nor, certainly, to a secure one. If<br />\nmore mecury lights are necessary, then let<br />\nus install them. But we must avoid<br />\nover-reaction. Sodium vapor lights cannot<br />\nprotect anyone from daytime assault (one<br />\nof the rape attempts occurred in the<br />\n<br />\nafternoon); we need to avoid excessive<br />\nexpense (the financial plight of the<br />\nUniversity is well enough publicized); and<br />\nday or night, for women and for those<br />\nmen who fear physical or sexual assault,<br />\nthe best defense is common sense<br />\nprecaution. The University has retained<br />\nthe consulting engineers Egli and Gampf,<br />\nInc. to deal with the security problem on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus. I, for one, hope<br />\nthat they will recognize the unacceptable<br />\nexpense and irreparable aesthetic damage<br />\nthat the proposed sodium vapor system,<br />\nBig Brother's answer to the 4th of July,<br />\nwould bring to Homewood.

In<br />\naddition to Hopkins, Towson<br />\nState, UMBC, University of<br />\nBaltimore, Coppin State, Morgan<br />\nState, and Loyola participated.<br />\nThe Blue Jays drew Towson in<br />\nthe first round.<br />\nFlick<br />\nIn a hard fought contest, the<br />\nBlue Jays lost a heartbreaker by<br />\nthe scot.' of 60-57. Hopkins lost<br />\nthe game on a controversial<br />\ndecision (or non-decision) late in<br />\nthe fourth quarter. With Towson<br />\nahead by the eventual winning<br />\n.scbre, Hopkins worked the ball<br />\ndown to the basket with 33<br />\nseconds left. Billy Jews fired up a<br />\nshort jumper. Towson forward'<br />\nJoey Jay went over the rim to<br />\nflick the ball out of the basket,<br />\ncommitting an obvious<br />\ngoaltending foul. But to the<br />\namazement of the fans and<br />\nplayers, referees Hickle and<br />\nVignolla called it a clean block.<br />\nFans from Hopkins, Loyola, and<br />\nCoppin were so incensed that<br />\nthey almost poured out onto the<br />\nfloor in protest. From that point<br />\non, Towson froze the ball until it<br />\nwas too late for the Jays to score.<br />\nIt was obvious from the<br />\nbeginning that this was no<br />\nfriendly rivalry.

The International Track Association<br />\n(I.T.A.) has put up $609,000 to subsidize<br />\n24-30 weekend events in North America<br />\nand another '15 in Europe.<br />\nAmateur followers have to feel<br />\ndisappointed at what could be the death<br />\nknell not only for the A.A.U. but possibly<br />\nthe existing N.C.A.A. track bodies as weak.<br />\nThe initial signings of stars Jim Ryun, Randy<br />\nMatson, Bob Seagren, and Lee Evans must have<br />\nalarmed even the most ardent worshippers of<br />\nthe amateur ideal.. One has to wonder whether<br />\nprofessional signings will stop at the post<br />\ncollege level, or will they begin raiding the<br />\ncollege ranks too? After all, in a world where<br />\nthe dollar is king, one wonders how Olympic<br />\nhopes and school loyalty will hold up against<br />\nfinancial reward.<br />\nThe most intriguing aspect for track buffs is<br />\nthe additional signing of New York Giants'<br />\n<br />\nsafetyman, Richmond Flowers, a former<br />\nhurdles star at the University of Tennessee.<br />\nFans may now be given the opportunity of<br />\nseeing other NFL stars display their talents now<br />\nthat there is a pro medium to compete.<br />\nImagine Bob Hayes, Jim Hines, and John Carlos<br />\nreturning to the world of track!<br />\nOf the athletes signed, all agree that since<br />\ntheir college graduation all had lost their<br />\ncompetitive drive for track. With money as the<br />\nincentive, the consensus is that they will regain<br />\nthat drive and return to their earlier heights of<br />\ngreatness. With baseball, football, and<br />\nbasketball stars earning hundreds of thousands<br />\nof dollars, it seems quite fitting for track greats<br />\nto have a method for continuing competition<br />\nwhen the burden of finances is lessened from<br />\nthe cost of training.<br />\nBut one must be very careful after watching<br />\nthe failures of professional soccer in North<br />\nAmerica. No one can say now whether the<br />\nsame fans who enthusiastically support A.A.U.<br />\nand N.C.A.A. meets will come to watch the<br />\nI.T.A. pros where such a venture can provoke,<br />\nat best, cautious optimism.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Roberts, both of whom are<br />\nexpected to contribute<br />\nthroughout the season.<br />\n01 all Lie weapons, the<br />\ngreatest things are expected trom<br />\nthis year's foil team.

He also<br />\nclaimed that the Physics labs<br />\ncould not be maintained at<br />\nmodern standards due to<br />\ninadequate budgeting.<br />\nA Physics Department<br />\ncommittee is currently looking<br />\ninto the matter of facilities<br />\nexpansion and is to make a<br />\nformal proposal in the near<br />\nfuture.

A jacket that<br />\nhas the word \"Yale\" written on it is<br />\ninvaluable to the hitcher, for then liberals<br /><br />\nwill associate the word with Bobby Seale<br />\nand William Sloan Coffin, while<br />\nconservatives will think, \"How nice, and<br />\nIvy Leaguer.\"<br />\nOnce the hitchhiker has his ride, a<br />\nwhole new set of difficulties must be<br />\nfaced. Unless the traveler is extremely<br />\nconfident in his ride possiblities, he is<br />\nforced to grasp at the first ride that<br />\ncomes along. Sometimes this can be a bad<br />\nthing. A southern friend of mine, hitching<br />\nthrough rural Tennessee, was picked up<br />\nby a farmer in a pickup truck. The<br />\nstudent had to share the flatbed part with<br />\nfifty crated-up chickens. Poor fellow, he<br />\nsmelled like Sunday dinner until<br />\nbreakfast time.<br />\nJust last week, another acquaintance of<br />\nmine was hitching home to Chevey Chase<br />\nfrom New Jersey for Thanksgiving. She<br />\nobtained a ride from a driver who assured<br />\nher that he was going to Washington, D.<br />\nC. But what he didn't say was that it was<br />\nby way of Hamilton, Ontario. People love<br />\ngames.<br />\nAt least once during his hitching career<br />\nthe traveller will have An Encounter. For<br />\nmen these experiences are of the<br />\nMidnight Cowboy variety. No less<br />\nunsettling is the female hitcher's<br />\n-<br /><br />\nThe policeman also plays an ingiortant<br /><br />\nrole in the life of the hitchhiker. Almost<br />\nall states have some form of restrictioq<br />\nagainst thumbing, but enforcement is<br />\npretty much of a local matter. In<br />\nMaryland everything is ok as long as the<br />\nhiker stands on the curb.<br />\nIf you're going to go places, you gotta<br />\ngo places right-or you ain't going to go<br />\nno place at<br /><br />\nIt's not surprising<br />\nit's the same all over<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nVisiting old friends during<br />\nThanksgiving is almost as American as the<br />\nturkey itself.

It's never<br />\ngood to try to do two things at the same<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe place was Hartford, the friends<br />\nwere old prep school pals, and the subject<br />\nmost often tossed around was college life.<br />\nHarvard, Yale, Ripon, Wheaton, and<br />\nSimmons (the good life) were<br />\nrepresented, and it was not too surprising<br />\nto learn that the schools suffer from the<br />\nsame ailments that Hopkins does.<br />\nThe host was from Harvard; he'd been<br />\nshoved into a Radcliff dorm, as the sister<br />\nschool wanted to liberate its students by<br />\nexposing them to members of the<br />\nopposite sex. I nearly went through the<br />\nroof when he told me of a mutual friend<br />\nhe met in the Square who had tumed<br />\nHare Krishma,\"shaved head and all.\"<br />\n\"Angus Murphy, can you believe it?\"<br />\nhe asked. Yup.<br />\nWhen I told him how free Hopkins<br />\nwas, he asked me how students<br />\nparticipated in making academic policy. I<br />\nwas embarrassed. I told him about the<br />\nAcademic Council, which holds its<br />\nmeetings like Russell Long does his<br />\n'Senate Finance Committee. \"You 're<br />\nkidding,\" he screamed, when I told him<br />\nnot a single student participated on the<br />\nAC. Harvard would never let that happen.<br />\nAt Yale,I'm led to believe the rich still<br />\nget richer, and the poor too, still get<br />\nricher. At one point, we re-lived the<br />\nHarvard-Yale game from which our token<br />\nbulldog had just returned. Whatever else<br />\nhas happened in New Haven and<br />\nCambridge during the last decade, the<br />\nrivalry is still there. The secret societies<br />\nare alive and well, too.

The Council's action<br />\nand the lack of proposals for changing the<br />\nintersession program, as reflected in the CUS<br />\nrecommendations should not be taken as indications<br />\nof satisfaction with the current system.<br />\nThe CUS prposals resulted from a study of<br />\nintersession conducted by a CUS subcommittee last<br />\nsemester. A list of suggested changes were compiled<br />\nfrom information collected from participants in last<br />\nJanuary's minimester. Suggestions included<br />\nrecommendations to hold a reading period before the<br />\nregular semester exams and to encourage departments<br />\nto investigate their intersession course offerings.<br />\nHowever, as the subcommittee's recommendations<br />\nwere considered - first by the CUS, then by the<br />\nAcademic Council, the proposals for change in the<br />\nsystem were either altered or deleted entirely,<br />\nproducing what appears to be a rote approval of the<br />\nentire minimester program. In the final estimation,<br />\nthe purpose of the lengthy interesession study was to<br />\nprovide recommendations for changing and upgrading<br />\nthe program.

They tried to tell me<br />\nthat Spiro Agnew was the best governor<br />\nthe state ever had, and Baltimore was still<br />\nthe most disgusting city on the East<br />\nCoast. I tried to tell them Baltimore<br />\nwasn't that bad and that Spiro really was,<br />\nbut they turned off their hearing : aids.<br />\nThat might be a Republican trait. They<br />\nmissed a wonderfully lewd comment on<br />\nConnecticut's first GUY legislature- since<br />\nthe stone age.<br />\nIt was late, and they wanted to get<br />\nsome sleep, but they said they still<br />\ncouldn't figure out why I, with such long<br />\nhair, was wearing a three-piece suit. \"You<br />\nsure look like a Republican. underneath,\"<br />\nGrandma chuckled.

I think this<br />\npremise is false, even insulting, but I'm<br />\nwriting princcipally to call critical<br />\nattention to sodium vapor lighting. These<br />\nhigh intensity lights cannot guarantee<br />\nsafety, are overly expensive, and<br />\nexceedingly hideous.<br />\nFor an urban campus, Homewood has<br /><br />\na particular charm and a distinct Georgian<br />\ngrace. While I hardly propose that we<br />\nrevert to gas lamps in order to match the<br />\ntone of the buildings and grounds, I<br />\nwould say a word in favor of the present<br />\nmercury vapor lights. They provide a<br />\nsensible, proportionate amount of light<br />\nwhen properly distributed. Why not<br />\npreserve a few quiet places on campus,<br />\nwhere one may walk and think with some<br />\nreasonable solitlude, where, on a warm<br />\nevening, we can get away and forget for a<br />\nmoment the asphalt, neon flashes, and<br />\nchain link fences of the city. There are<br />\nfew such escapes left. If we install sodium<br />\nvapor lights at Homewood we will have<br /><br />\nperpetual, horrid daylight: an Orwelllan<br />\nnightmare. Everything will be flooded in<br />\nthe pink glow of a railroad flare at a<br />\ndisaster scene. There are parts of the city<br />\nwhere this blinding glare is sadly<br />\nnecessary, but the Keyser quadrangle is<br />\nnot the Mt. Sinai Hospital parking lot.<br />\nSodium vapor lights would, in an<br />\nawsthetic sense, kill the campus to save it.<br />\nMy objections are not to a well-lighted<br />\ncampus nor, certainly, to a secure one. If<br />\nmore mecury lights are necessary, then let<br />\nus install them. But we must avoid<br />\nover-reaction. Sodium vapor lights cannot<br />\nprotect anyone from daytime assault (one<br />\nof the rape attempts occurred in the<br /><br />\nafternoon); we need to avoid excessive<br />\nexpense (the financial plight of the<br />\nUniversity is well enough publicized); and<br />\nday or night, for women and for those<br />\nmen who fear physical or sexual assault,<br />\nthe best defense is common sense<br />\nprecaution. The University has retained<br />\nthe consulting engineers Egli and Gampf,<br />\nInc. to deal with the security problem on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus. I, for one, hope<br />\nthat they will recognize the unacceptable<br />\nexpense and irreparable aesthetic damage<br />\nthat the proposed sodium vapor system,<br />\nBig Brother's answer to the 4th of July,<br />\nwould bring to Homewood.

In<br />\naddition to Hopkins, Towson<br />\nState, UMBC, University of<br />\nBaltimore, Coppin State, Morgan<br />\nState, and Loyola participated.<br />\nThe Blue Jays drew Towson in<br />\nthe first round.<br />\nFlick<br />\nIn a hard fought contest, the<br />\nBlue Jays lost a heartbreaker by<br />\nthe scot.' of 60-57. Hopkins lost<br />\nthe game on a controversial<br />\ndecision (or non-decision) late in<br />\nthe fourth quarter. With Towson<br />\nahead by the eventual winning<br />\n.scbre, Hopkins worked the ball<br />\ndown to the basket with 33<br />\nseconds left. Billy Jews fired up a<br />\nshort jumper. Towson forward'<br />\nJoey Jay went over the rim to<br />\nflick the ball out of the basket,<br />\ncommitting an obvious<br />\ngoaltending foul. But to the<br />\namazement of the fans and<br />\nplayers, referees Hickle and<br />\nVignolla called it a clean block.<br />\nFans from Hopkins, Loyola, and<br />\nCoppin were so incensed that<br />\nthey almost poured out onto the<br />\nfloor in protest. From that point<br />\non, Towson froze the ball until it<br />\nwas too late for the Jays to score.<br />\nIt was obvious from the<br />\nbeginning that this was no<br />\nfriendly rivalry. The Tigers, urged<br />\non by their fans, harrassed and<br />\nthreatened the Jays at the start<br />\nof the game. But the Blue Jays<br /><br />\nwere not intimidated, leaving the<br />\ncourt at halftime with a 33-27<br />\nlead.<br />\nTowson scored the first six<br />\npoints. John Rutter broke the<br />\nstring to send the Jays on their<br />\nway.

The International Track Association<br />\n(I.T.A.) has put up $609,000 to subsidize<br />\n24-30 weekend events in North America<br />\nand another '15 in Europe.<br />\nAmateur followers have to feel<br />\ndisappointed at what could be the death<br />\nknell not only for the A.A.U. but possibly<br />\nthe existing N.C.A.A. track bodies as weak.<br />\nThe initial signings of stars Jim Ryun, Randy<br />\nMatson, Bob Seagren, and Lee Evans must have<br />\nalarmed even the most ardent worshippers of<br />\nthe amateur ideal.. One has to wonder whether<br />\nprofessional signings will stop at the post<br />\ncollege level, or will they begin raiding the<br />\ncollege ranks too? After all, in a world where<br />\nthe dollar is king, one wonders how Olympic<br />\nhopes and school loyalty will hold up against<br />\nfinancial reward.<br />\nThe most intriguing aspect for track buffs is<br />\nthe additional signing of New York Giants'<br /><br />\nsafetyman, Richmond Flowers, a former<br />\nhurdles star at the University of Tennessee.<br />\nFans may now be given the opportunity of<br />\nseeing other NFL stars display their talents now<br />\nthat there is a pro medium to compete.<br />\nImagine Bob Hayes, Jim Hines, and John Carlos<br />\nreturning to the world of track!<br />\nOf the athletes signed, all agree that since<br />\ntheir college graduation all had lost their<br />\ncompetitive drive for track. With money as the<br />\nincentive, the consensus is that they will regain<br />\nthat drive and return to their earlier heights of<br />\ngreatness. With baseball, football, and<br />\nbasketball stars earning hundreds of thousands<br />\nof dollars, it seems quite fitting for track greats<br />\nto have a method for continuing competition<br />\nwhen the burden of finances is lessened from<br />\nthe cost of training.<br />\nBut one must be very careful after watching<br />\nthe failures of professional soccer in North<br />\nAmerica. No one can say now whether the<br />\nsame fans who enthusiastically support A.A.U.<br />\nand N.C.A.A. meets will come to watch the<br />\nI.T.A. pros where such a venture can provoke,<br />\nat best, cautious optimism.<br /><br />\nJohn Roberts, both of whom are<br />\nexpected to contribute<br />\nthroughout the season.<br />\n01 all Lie weapons, the<br />\ngreatest things are expected trom<br />\nthis year's foil team. In past years<br />\nfoil has for some reason been the<br />\nweak weapon; this is definitely<br />\nnot the case this year.

Hopkins<br />\nwill be fencing three<br />\nmeets-UMBC at 2 PM will be<br />\nsandwiched between unofficial<br />\nmeets with Georgetown at 1 PM<br />\nand St. Mary's at 3PM. The idea<br />\nis to simply gain experience for<br />\nnext week's journey south to<br />\nWilliam and Mary, Duke, and<br />\nNorth Carolina. During<br />\nintersession, the fencing team<br />\nwill again make a tour-this year<br />\nto the New York-New Jersey<br />\narea. This trip is paid for entirely<br />\nby the fencers themselves. Tough<br />\nopponents this year look to be<br />\nDuke, Stevens, Temple North<br />\nCarolina, Montclair State and<br />\nPaterson State.<br />\nCoach Dick Oles summed up<br />\nthis season's prospects saying \"If<br />\nthings go reasonably well we'll<br />\nhave another winning season.
