All the way to the<br />\nstation-house he laughed and sang, told his<br />\nblue-coated captors what a fine city Baltimore is to be drunk in, and essayed alcoholic witticisms upon the bedraggled condition of the wretched victim of his blow, who<br />\ncrouched wet and shivering in the forward<br />\ncorner of the patrol wagon.<br />\nBut a night in a cell at the Central brought<br />\na different frame of mind. With the dawn<br />\ncame sobriety and an unpleasant realization<br />\nthat ripe watermelons are not the kind of<br />\ncargo that one can well keep indefinitely<br />\nUpon one's hands; nor, for that matter, that<br />\none cares to leave unguarded at a public<br />\nwharf. Cap'n Bill had just reached Baltimore the afternoon before from a voyage<br />\nup the west coast of the Chesapeake from<br />\nCharles county to Anne Arundel, during<br />\nwhich he had collected a cargo of the best<br />\nMaryland melons. The Cap'n had bought<br />\nthe melons dirt cheap, and their successful<br />\nmarketing meant a neat sum to him. The<br />\nloss of the cargo, on the contrary, would<br />\nleave him worse than penniless, since his jag<br />\nof the day before had been secured from the<br />\nsaloon-keeper on the strength of his prospects. In his eagerness to save the cost of<br />\na supper, he had upon his arrival in port<br />\nat once discharged the lad who, for the sake<br />\nof his passage, had come up the coast with<br />\n<br />\nB<br />\n<br />\nhim. Now he cursed himself for a stingy<br />\nfool. No one to sell his perishable cargo<br />\nfor him; no one even to protect it; he himself in prison without a penny to pay a possible fine or a friend to go his bail! Small<br />\nwonder, then, that the unfortunate speculator writhed in his narrow cell and impotently cursed the watermelons, himself, the<br />\npolice, and all the other people and things<br />\nwhich seemed to have conspired to ruin him.<br />\n\"If those melons lie out in the sun for<br />\nsix hours more, even an Eastern Sho' coon<br />\nwould refuse to touch them,\" groaned the<br />\nCap'n. \"Six hours, and I'll probably get<br />\nsix weeks in jail! I'll be lucky ever to see<br />\nthe boat again. Why didn't I go straight<br />\nto the commission merchant's, instead of<br />\nstopping for a drink?\" The Cap'n waved<br />\nhis clenched fists above his great ox-like<br />\nhead with its bleared eyes and shock of red<br />\nhair, and, in a torrent of profanity which<br />\nan oysterman might have envied, gave free<br />\nvent to his anger and self-contempt.<br />\nIf it were only cloudy, he thought in a<br />\ncalmer moment, the fruit might keep through<br />\nthe day\u2014that is if the innumerable loungers,<br />\nblack and white, who swarmed upon the<br />\nwharves, would let any of it remain so long<br />\nunstolen. But through his bars he could<br />\nsee the early beams of the August sun already blistering the floor in the passage-way.<br />\nThen the Cap'n bethought him of the warders. Perhaps they would help him. Surely<br />\nit was not their purpose to make him lose<br />\nhis cargo as well as his liberty. He called<br />\nthem. First in the oily tones he assumed<br />\nwhen buying fruit from the rich farmers<br />\nor selling it again to the still richer commission merchants. Then, getting no response,<br />\nin the gruff voice he used to the men he<br />\nsometimes employed when trade was brisk.<br />\nFinally, completely losing his temper, he<br />\npressed his great shaggy face close to the<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nbars and bellowed in a way that might have<br />\nbeen heard from Fort McHenry to Fort Carroll.<br />\nHow long the Cap'n would have kept up<br />\nthis disturbance it is impossible to say. He<br />\nhad not been at it long when he became<br />\naware of faint sounds in the cell adjoining<br />\nhis. \"Lawd in Hebben! Lawd in Hebben!\"<br />\nrepeated a weak voice in trembling accents,<br />\n\"Save an' defen' us!\"<br />\nThe Cap'n curiosity was aroused. Standing on tiptoe upon the rude cot in his cell,<br />\nhe was able to grasp the curving bars above<br />\nand draw himself up until his eyes were on<br />\na level with the top of the oak partition between the cells. What he saw was a middleaged darkey, fat and terror-stricken, sitting<br />\nupon the edge of a cot, from which he had<br />\napparently just been awakened.<br />\nThe Cap'n struggled with a recollection.<br />\n\"Hi there, Jim Crow,\" he said at last with<br />\na grin. \"Seems to me I remember that breadbasket o' yourn. It ain't punctured?\"<br />\nThe negro's face expressed both relief and<br />\nresentment. \"I thought you must be a line,<br />\ner leastways a tagger, from de noises in dar,\"<br />\nhe began, voicing the former emotion. Then<br />\nyielding to the latter, \"But I don't want to<br />\nhave nothin' more to do with you, suh,\" he<br />\nsaid with dignity.<br />\nThe Cap'n's mirth fairly bubbled over.<br />\n\"Why, you black limb o' Satan\u2014\" he began,<br />\nwhen an inspiration suddenly striking him,<br />\nhe let himself down, piled pillow and bedclothing in a heap on the cot, and mounted<br />\nupon them to continue the conversation more<br />\ncomfortably.<br />\n\"Say, Jim, what are you in here for anyway?\" he questioned eagerly.<br />\n\"For bein' knocked into de water by you.<br />\nYou ought to know,\" replied the negro sullenly.<br />\n\"I thought that was it; but my mind is<br />\nrather confused about yesterday,\" explained<br />\nCap'n Bill. \"I suppose I took a glass or so<br />\ntoo much liquor,\" he confessed. \"But look<br />\nhere, Jim, you're sure to be released this<br />\nmorning as soon as the Judge comes. What<br />\ndo you say to 'tending to some business for<br />\nme at good pay?\"<br />\n\"My name, suh, is Mistah Johnson,\" replied the colored man with dignity, \"and I<br />\nain't gwine to have nothin' to do with you<br />\nor your affairs.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe lion in the Cap'n's nature struggled<br />\nhard with the serpent, but was finally subdued. \"Look here, Johnson, I'll give you<br />\nfive dollars,\" coaxed the beleaguered mariner.<br />\n\"Mistah\" Johnson vouchsafed no answer.<br />\n\"Ain't no use to try to bribe me,\" said the<br />\nAfrican with fine scorn. \"I'se a local<br />\npreacher.\"<br />\nIn his heart the Cap'n cursed the whole<br />\ntribe of Ham. \"There's no bribing about<br />\nit,\" he urged in despair. \"This is how the<br />\ncase stands. I've five hundred of the best<br />\nwatermelons ever grown in the State lying<br />\nin the sun by the wharf. If they stay there<br />\nmuch longer they won't be worth throwing<br />\naway. You see that they get to Davis Bros.<br />\nby noon and I'll give you fifteen dollars.<br />\nThe judge is sure to release you at once,<br />\nwhile I'm just as sure to get a month or two<br />\nin jail. Last of all, if you won 't agree to<br />\ndo it, I'll swear to the judge that you hit<br />\nme first, and have you sent to jail with me.\"<br />\n\"Mistah\" Johnson scratched his respectable head, and gazed meditatively upon the<br />\nfloor with a glimmer in his eyes of what one<br />\nmight have called cunning if one had not<br />\nknown him to be a local preacher.<br />\n\"You ain't jest de kind of man I likes<br />\nto do business with,\" he answered finally,<br />\n\"but I believe in returning good for evil,<br />\nand for twenty dollars I'll see to them<br />\nmelons.\"<br />\nThe price was a stiff one, but the poor<br />\nskipper was desperate and readily agreed.<br />\nThe negro received from him a paper in lead.<br />\npencil empowering him to act for the Cap'n<br />\nin disposing of the cargo. The melons were<br />\nto be taken as quickly as possible to Davis<br />\nBros., who were to sell them and place the<br />\namonnt, less a commission, to the credit of<br />\nCaptain Bill Watkins. Upon the delivery<br />\nof the melons to Davis Bros., the negro was<br />\nto report to Cap'n Bill at the station-house<br />\nand receive his pay.<br />\nWhen this last clause in the oral contract<br />\nwas agreed upon, Cap'n Bill had to duck<br />\nhis head below the top of the partition to<br />\nhide his satisfaction. \"Much twenty dollars the coon will ever get from me.!\" he<br />\nchuckled gleefully to himself. \"I haven't<br />\na copper about me, and Davis Bros. will be<br />\nholding the melon-money.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nCap'n Bill's plans worked beautifully at come that afternoon. Indeed, he never did<br />\nthe beginning. Upon the Cap'n's confession come. Just thirty days afterwards Cap'n<br />\nthat he alone was to blame for the assault, Bill learned at Davis Bros. that the firm had<br />\nthe sable parson was at once released by the sold a splendid lot of watermelons for a coljustice, and the Cap'n given thirty days in ored farmer of a respectable and rather corjail. Back to his cell again, the schemer pulent appearance, but had never heard of<br />\nhugged himself delightedly and thought of Cap'n Bill's cargo. Greatly to his surprise,<br />\nthe time later in the day when the negro the Cap'n found his boat tied just where he<br />\nshould return for his money. \"I'll tell him had left it at the public wharf. Of waterto go to thunder for it,\" he gurgled, \"and melons, however, there was not in it so much<br />\nI guess the turnkey won't let him draw a as a rind.<br />\nrazor on me.

U.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nOwing to a misapprehension at the time<br />\nof our last issue, the NEWS-LETTER was unable to make any editorial comment upon the<br />\nresignation of its Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Morse.<br />\nThe present editors felt, however, that on<br />\naccount of the value of his services and the<br />\ngreat improvement in the NEWS-LETTER under his direction, some acknowledgement of<br />\nhis work is more than ever necessary.<br />\nAs most of our readers probably know,<br />\nthe reason for Mr. Morse's withdrawal from<br />\nthe management of the I\\Nws-Ltrrit,R was to<br />\ndevote himself more fully to the work of<br />\n1905 \"Hullabaloo,\" of which he is chief<br />\neditor.<br />\nThe best proof of a successful editorship<br />\nis a successful paper; and even at the risk of<br />\nappearing boastful, we can not resist the inclination to comment upon the improvement<br />\nin the NEWS-LETTER during Mr. Morse's incumbency. The improved appearance of<br />\nthe paper is too evident to need mention, and<br />\nwe believe that the improvement in subjectmatter is equally apparent. From many<br />\nsources, both in and out of the University,<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER has lately received words<br />\nof commendation. From two such good<br />\nauthorities as the editors of the Harvard and<br />\nthe University of Virginia monthlies it has<br />\n<br />\nhad messages of direct approval; while even<br />\nfrom so far away as the University of California it has been indirectly informed that<br />\nthe paper is read and appreciated. The increased circulation of the NEWS-LETTER is<br />\nanother good sign of heightened popularity.<br />\nThat this happy state of affairs is largely due<br />\nto the ability, the industry and the good business sense of Mr. Morse, the new management takes pleasure in saying. The departure of Mr. Morse from the chief-editorship<br />\nis viewed with unmixed regret by his colleagues, who wish him equal success with<br />\nthe new interests he is now serving.<br />\nUnder the new management there may be<br />\nsome changes, and probably many mistakes.<br />\nThe present board had not yet served its full<br />\nterm of apprenticeship when Mr. Morse's<br />\npremature resignation occurred, and in the<br />\nordinary course of events they would not<br />\nhave come into control until after Christmas.<br />\nConsequently, the new heads feel that they<br />\nwill have a hard time in trying to keep the<br />\nstandard of the NEWS-LETTER Up to its past<br />\nrecord. All they ask is that their readers<br />\nwill be lenient if they do make mistakes, and<br />\nthey, on their side, in accepting the control<br />\nof the publication, promise that they will do<br />\ntheir best to carry on the work as well as<br />\nit was carried on before them.<br />\nProbably very few of the students of the<br />\nUniversity realize how great credit is due<br />\nto Messrs. Pearre and Straughn for their<br />\nwork in connection with the football team<br />\nthis year. Mr. Pearre accepted the captaincy of the team at a time when no one else<br />\nwas willing to take the risk of the failure<br />\nwhich seemed not unlikely. There were<br />\ngreat difficulties in the way. It was doubtful whether the Athletic Association could<br />\nbe persuaded to recognize the team, or advance money for its expenses, and although<br />\nthere was great enthusiasm expressed among<br />\nthe student body, enthusiasm alone does not<br />\nsupport teams. They need men and money.<br />\nAnother difficulty was the trouble about getting the medical school contingent out in<br />\nforce, owing to their distance from the cage.<br />\nBoth these difficulites Captain Pearre successfully coped with and led the team to an<br />\nalmost unbroken series of victories, in which<br />\nit was only scored on once, when St. John's<br />\ndefeated us by the score of six to five.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThat, however, was in the early days of<br />\nthe team's history, before it had really got<br />\ntogether and begun to play the kind of football that later became identified with it.<br />\nManager Straughn deserves no less credit<br />\nthan Captain Pearre for his work in connection with the team. Although it was rather<br />\nlate in the season when the team was organized, yet the manager arranged an excellent<br />\nseries of games and got some very good dates,<br />\ntoo. Financially the team was a success.<br />\nIt came out at the end of the season with a<br />\nsubstantial balance to its credit after the<br />\nmoney advanced by the Athletic Association<br />\nhad all been paid back. It is due to the<br />\nefforts of Captain Pearre and Manager<br />\nStraughn, backed by the splendid material<br />\nthey got together, that the Athletic Association has no reason to repent of its action in<br />\nrecognizing the team, which in every way<br />\nhas been a credit to its University.<br />\n<br />\nok,<br />\n<br />\nIt may not be amiss for the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nto call attention to the fact that there is a<br />\nvacancy on the editorial staff of the paper,<br />\nand that several more will come about somewhat later in the year. Now is the time for<br />\nstudents with a literary turn to try for<br />\nplaces. Freshmen, especially, should interest themselves in this announcement, as the<br />\ngreater length of their future at the University makes them more acceptable material<br />\nthan upper-classmen. Although a number<br />\nof Freshmen (still less than a dozen) are<br />\nalready in the contest, the list of candidates<br />\nis still too short for a class the size of<br />\nNaughty-seven.<br />\nUniversity news, jokes, poetry\u2014anything<br />\noriginal that is short and bright\u2014will count<br />\nin the selection of men for the positions.<br />\nCandidates may write under nomme-dePlumes if they choose; but should always<br />\nsign their real names for the benefit of the<br />\neditors.

Some twelve or fifteen light men<br />\nwere present, and while these were desirous<br />\nof doing what they could to help a team<br />\nalong, the question that confronted them was<br />\nhow to get the big men interested, and how<br />\nto interest the Athletic Board. A temporary<br />\ncaptain and a temporary manager were elected, but nothing was done. It was not, however, their fault. Their bands were tied for<br />\nthey had no authority from anyone to transact business.<br />\nMr. Stuart Janney, an old Hopkins athlete,<br />\nheard of our plight and volunteered to address a mass-meeting of the students. Accordingly, three or four dozen undergraduates met in the trophy room and the entire<br />\nMatters looked<br />\nsituation was discussed.<br />\ngloomy, but Mr. Janney stirred the men to<br />\na high pitch of enthusiasm by saying that if<br />\nnecessary, the alumni would stand by a Hopkins football team. A great deal of trouble<br />\nwas experienced in getting a man to undertake the captaincy. Several men were asked<br />\nand refused. At last, Pea rre said he would<br />\ntry. For this one step, if for nothing else,<br />\nCapt. Pearre deserves the greatest praise<br />\nfrom the student body. Not knowing what<br />\na day might bring forth, he went to work.<br />\nHe visited the medical school and the men<br />\nin the graduate department daily. By earnest pleadings he interested these men, and<br />\nat the first practice there were a considerable number of players anxious to try for<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nthe team. At the next practice the number<br />\nincreased, and in a little while the manager<br />\nhad all he could do to keep the men supplied<br />\nwith clothes. After the season was on in<br />\nearnest, there was scarcely a practice when<br />\nover two fully uniformed teams did not appear in the cage.<br />\nManager Straughn had considerable difficulty in arranging a schedule that was of the<br />\nkind he desired, but, fortunately, the last<br />\nthree games of the season were good drawing cards. The season was a successful one<br />\nfrom almost every point of view. Only once<br />\nduring the entire season was the 'varsity<br />\nscored on. After three days' practice, we<br />\nplayed St. John's College, at Annapolis, and<br />\nthe score ended 6 to 5 in favor of St. John's.<br />\nIn this game Blanck made a beautiful 100yard run for a touchdown, but failed to kick<br />\ngoal. In almost every point of the game<br />\nour boys showed that they were decidedly<br />\nsuperior to their opponents, but the team<br />\nwas in no physical condition and was not yet<br />\nworking together. From that game the team<br />\ntook on form rapidly and not once again during the season did we have any occasion to<br />\nfear defeat. Mt. Washington club, which<br />\nwas fully expected \"to put it all over us,\"<br />\ndecisively defeated, and our old rivals, the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, went down before<br />\nus by the overwhelming score of 23 to 0.<br />\nOn Thanksgivi.ng Day, with a crippled team,<br />\nwe defeated Randolph-Macon by a score of<br />\n6 to 0.<br />\nFinancially the team did very well. Every<br />\ngame up to Mt. Washington rapidly exhausted the appropriation, but here was the<br />\nturning point in finances as well as in the<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwork of the team. The management would<br />\nhave been able to turn over to the association an amount that was in excess of the<br />\nappropriation, but each man on the team will<br />\nbe given a handsome sweater with the official<br />\n\"II\" on it. This necessarily decreases the<br />\nfunds, but not to any great extent.<br />\n\"Sandy\" Randall, who played such a star<br />\ngame at quarter, was elected captain for<br />\nnext year, and the prospects are for the<br />\ngreatest team Hopkins ever saw. On the local gridiron will be seen some of the biggest<br />\nteams in the country.<br />\nHOPKINS, 6; RANDOLPH-MACON 0.<br />\nBefore fully fifteen hundred people, Hopkins downed the Randolph-Macon College<br />\nteam at Oriole Park on Thanksgiving afternoon by the score of 6 to 0, in the last game<br />\nof one of the most successful seasons that any<br />\nHopkins eleven ever had.<br />\nThe University team was handicapped in<br />\nthis contest by the fact that it was without<br />\nthe services of five of its regular players.<br />\nThe substitutes, however, put up a fine garn,e,<br />\nand showed by their hard, consistent playing that there was much good 'varsity material present, which, with a little good training and coaching, could be easily developed.<br />\nThe two teams were about evenly matched,<br />\nthe average weight of the Hopkins team being about three pounds more than that of<br />\nthe Randolph-Macon team. In the first half<br />\nof the game it was \"nip and tuck\" between<br />\nthe two teams, each side finding it hard to<br />\ngain an advantage.<br />\nIn the second half, however, matters took<br />\na different aspect. Randolph-Macon kicked<br />\noff to Hopkins, who carried the ball back to<br />\nthe 40-yd line where she lost on a fumble.<br />\nRandolph-Macon, in turn, was held for<br />\ndowns, and kicked to Hopkins' 15-yd line.<br />\nAt this point, however, Hopkins took a brace,<br />\nand seemed to make holes in her opponents'<br />\nline at will. Blanck, Betts, and McDonnell<br />\nwere sent through line for consistent gains<br />\nof five, ten, and fifteen yards each, and withm seven minutes Blanck was pushed across<br />\nthe line for the only touchdown. He was<br />\nsuccessful in kicking goal.<br />\nThe half ended soon after, with the ball<br />\non Hopkins' 45-yd line. One feature of this<br />\nhalf, and of the game in fact, was the 90-yd<br />\nrun of Iglehart for a touchdown; which, how-<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\never, was not allowed as one of the Hopkins'<br />\nteam was offside.<br />\nEvery man on the team played a hard,<br />\ndashing game. Blanck, at right halfback,<br />\nplayed up to his old form; and Betts, left<br />\nhalfback, and McDonnell, fullback, played a<br />\nsplendid game ,showing themselves to be consistent gainers, as they had in all the games<br />\nof this season. Boyce was very efficient at<br />\nright end, as were Kelley and Stone at tackle,<br />\nCrothers and Eichelberger at guard, and .<br />\nPreble at centre.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\nRandolph-Macon.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nDavis<br />\nLeft end<br />\nBoyce<br />\nMast<br />\nLeft tackle<br />\nKelley<br />\nMills<br />\nLeft guard<br />\nCrothers<br />\nJames<br />\nCentre<br />\nPreble<br />\nPhilpotts<br />\nRight guard<br />\nStone<br />\nLeavell<br />\nBenton<br />\nRight tackle<br />\nRight end<br />\nSmith<br />\nStewart<br />\nQuarterback<br />\n.Randolph<br />\nIglehart<br />\nhalfback<br />\nLeft<br />\nSchenk<br />\nBetts<br />\nBlanck (capt.)....Right halfback...Walters (capt.)<br />\nMcDonnell<br />\nFullback<br />\nThrasher<br />\nOfficials\u2014Bray (Lafayette), referee; Hart (Georgetown University), umpire.

OF M., 0.<br />\nThe University of Maryland football team\u2014<br />\n\"our greatest rival on the local gridiron\"\u2014<br />\nwent nobly down to defeat before Hopkins'<br />\ntrained eleven, on Saturday Nov. 19, at Oriole Park. The last time we played Maryland<br />\ntwo years ago, a score of 6-0 was made<br />\nagainst us, but retaliation was complete at<br />\nthis game when we rolled up a score of 23-0<br />\nin our favor. The result was surprising, for<br />\nalthough we were sanguine of success, every<br />\none thought the score would be closer. The<br />\nfive hundred followers of black and red fairly gasped at the relentless persistence with<br />\nwhich the lads in black and blue crossed their<br />\nline.<br />\nThe well-known rivalry between the two<br />\nteams, together with fine weather, brought<br />\nout a crowd of over a thousand persons to<br />\nsee the game. The Hopkins colors were unfurled on the west stand, and the Maryland<br />\nrooters, with a concise abbreviation of a<br />\nbrass band, rallied on the east stand. Many<br />\nladies, wearing the colors of either University, occupied the grand-stand. Promptly at<br />\n3.30 our team trotted out on the field, and fifteen minutes later they were followed by the<br />\nMaryland eleven. During the interim re-<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncoired for the formalities of the toss-up, the<br />\nrooters from either side of the gridiron<br />\nhurled their defiant yells.<br />\nIIopkins won the kick-off, and Randall<br />\nsent the ball to Watts, the Maryland fullback. The latter succeeded in reaching the<br />\n20-yd line, but the oval went no further.<br />\nHopkins got the ball on downs, but an attempted \"fake\" pass lost us the ball on a<br />\nfumble. Cheered by this, Maryland took a<br />\nbrace, and by repeated plunges, Watts and<br />\nStone forced the battle back to the centre of<br />\nthe field. The fine tackling of Boyce and<br />\nStewart, together with the splendid blocking<br />\nof Crothers and Kellam, soon began to tell,<br />\nhowever, and, taking a larger dose of the<br />\nsame bracer, Hopkins procured the ball. Then<br />\nthe hammering began in earnest. For about<br />\nten minutes Maryland had \"cannon to the<br />\nright, left, and front of them.\" Blanck and<br />\nWorthington were the guns in front, and<br />\nthey \"volleyed and thundered\" without stop<br />\nuntil they carried their opponents back over<br />\ntheir goal line for the first touchdown. Randall made the score 6-0 by kicking goal.<br />\nPluckily the Maryland boys responded to the<br />\nencouragements of their rooters, and the 40yd run of Brent, their captain, called forth<br />\nThe half<br />\nthe admiration of both sides.<br />\nbeing<br />\nscore<br />\nthe<br />\nwithout<br />\nended, however,<br />\nchanged.<br />\nDuring the intermission the Hopkins rooters in ranks of four paraded about the field<br />\nfollowing the Black and Blue banner, which<br />\nwas guarded on either side by our two gridiron cripples, Morse and MacSherry. New<br />\nsongs had been arranged for the occasion<br />\nby Mr. Griswold, Chief Rooter, and the<br />\ngrand-stand Was demonstrative in its appreciation.<br />\nIn the second half Maryland did not once<br />\nsucceed in making the first down. Fired<br />\nwith the success of the first half our boys,<br />\nwith common impulse, hurled themselves<br />\nmercilessly on the opposing line. Relying<br />\nsolely on line-plunges, Blanck, McDonnell,<br />\nand Worthington were alternately sent<br />\nthrough for gains of five yards each until<br />\nMcDonnell ploughed through Maryland's defense for another touchdown. Again Randall kicked goal. Maryland's third kick-off<br />\nsent the ball to Blanck, and the line-plunging<br />\ntactics were repeated by our backs. In a<br />\nshort time Maryland's line gave out under<br />\n<br />\nthe terrific hammering and the ball was carried over for our third touchdown. Goal<br />\nwas again kicked. We then kicked off to<br />\nMaryland but held them for downs, and they<br />\nwere obliged to punt. Randall caught the<br />\nball and by means of clever dodging, warmed<br />\nhimself with a good run into Maryland's territory. By the same line-bucking Worthington gained the fourth touchdown. Day darkened with the spirits of the rooters on the<br />\neast stand, and on this account time was<br />\ncalled with ten more minutes of play.<br />\nAfter the game the Hopkins rooters again<br />\nformed in line and paraded from the grounds<br />\ndown to the cage, where each man of the<br />\nteam was given a rousing cheer.<br />\nThe winning of this game gives us right<br />\nto claim the collegiate championship of the<br />\nState, since we have downed much stronger<br />\nteams than has St. John's College, the- only<br />\ncollege which has won from us this season.<br />\nMuch discussion has even been caused in<br />\nfootball circles as to whether we can not<br />\nclaim superiority over the Maryland Athletic<br />\nteam, which lost to Mt.

Very<br />\nsoon, however, they fumbled; and this, happening so early in the game, seemed to take<br />\nthe life out of them.<br />\nThis fumble occurred on the 32-yd line,<br />\nand a few minutes after the Freshmen, by<br />\na quarterback run of Iglehart and a line<br />\nplunge of Hartman took the ball over for<br />\nthe first touchdown. Raleigh kicked goal.<br />\nOn the next kick-off, the advantage was<br />\nwith first one side and then the other. At<br />\none time, the Juniors held the Freshmen for<br />\ndowns on their own 9-yd line. The Juniors<br />\nthen carried the ball back to their 26-yd line<br />\nwhere they lost on downs. On regaining the<br />\nball, the Freshmen took it back over the<br />\nground they had lost, and in a short time<br />\nhad shoved Stewart over the line for a second touchdown.<br />\nRaleigh failed at an easy goal, leaving the<br />\nscore at the end of the half 11 to 0.<br />\nIn the second half, the Juniors got the ball<br />\non a fumble on the Freshmen's 22-yd line<br />\nafter a short time of play. With the ball<br />\nin their possession, the Juniors, by gains of<br />\n3 to 5 yards each by Mengel, Meyer, and<br />\nGriffith, worked the ball down the field to<br />\nthe Freshmen's one-yard line. On the next<br />\nline down, the ball was given to Griffith,<br />\nwho, by making a beautiful hurdle, crossed<br />\nthe line for the Juniors' only touchdown.<br />\nMengel failed to make a goal.<br />\nOn the following kick-off, Iglehart ran the<br />\nball back to the 37-yd line; and, from this<br />\npoint on, by hard line plunges advanced the<br />\nball down the field, and pushed Werekshagen<br />\nover the line \u2022 for their last touchdown.<br />\nRaleigh kicked goal.<br />\nThe cane rush followed immediately after<br />\nthe game. In this event the Juniors evened<br />\nup with the Freshmen for the defeat in football. The sides were allowed to fight for<br />\n<br />\nthe cane for one minute. At the end of this<br />\ntime the hands on the cane were counted and<br />\nit was found that the Juniors had won by<br />\n9 hands to 5 for the Freshmen.<br />\nIt was evident from the begnining that<br />\nthe Juniors would win this event, for when<br />\nthe whistle was blown for the struggle to<br />\nbegin, Mengel, who held the cane for the<br />\nJuniors, pulled Raleigh across the line into<br />\nthe juniors' territory, thereby giving the<br />\nJuniors a better chance to win.<br />\nThose having hands on the cane were:<br />\nJuniors.<br />\nMengel<br />\nHolly Smith<br />\nHill<br />\nGunts<br />\nRevell<br />\nEdlaviteh<br />\n<br />\nFreshmen.<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nRaleigh 2<br />\nSehmeisser 2<br />\nBranham 1<br />\nTotal 5<br />\n<br />\nTotal 9<br />\n<br />\nORIGINAL JOKES.<br />\n'07--Who gave the Homewood estate to<br />\nHopkins?<br />\n'06\u2014W(h)y, man, don't you know?<br />\n<br />\nDean (sternly)\u2014Why were you absent<br />\nfrom minor French, last week?<br />\nStudent\u2014Oh, I took French leave, for an<br />\nEaster holiday, sir!<br />\n<br />\nEnraptured Poet\u2014What a shining face h:.61<br />\nyonder lad!<br />\nProsaic Friend\u2014Yes, he's a boot-black.<br />\n<br />\nA gilded youth in evening dress\u2014<br />\nA beggar man in something less\u2014<br />\n\"A match, kind sir,\" the poor man said;<br />\nThe ehappie turned his lordly head:<br />\n\"Oh, calm 't yuh see I am matchless?\"<br />\n<br />\nThe bulbul hummeth like a brook<br />\nUpon the pooh-pooh tree.<br />\nAnd now and then he takes a look<br />\nAt you and me,<br />\nAt me and you.<br />\nKuchi!<br />\nKuchoo!<br />\nOwen Seaman.<br />\n<br />\n\f12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE GRADUATE DEPARTMENTS.<br />\nIn a recent trip made through Virginia by<br />\nDr. Edward Mathews, and two of the students of his department, Messrs. Grasty and<br />\nVanderhorst, an attempt was made to interpret and correlate its Piedmont formations<br />\nwith those of Maryland. The trip was more<br />\nor less in the nature of a reconnaissance, but<br />\nwas successful in as much as it substantiated<br />\nseveral of the theories of Dr. Mathews, who<br />\nis considered an authority on the Piedmont,<br />\nhaving devoted the past ten years to the<br />\nstudy of its intricate and complex problems.<br />\nIn the spring he will go to North Carolina<br />\nand there study and trace out the same formations. The results of his investigations<br />\nwill doubtless be published by the North<br />\nCarolina State Survey, under whose auspices<br />\nthe work is to be done.<br />\nOf the more than 700 miles travelled, over<br />\nfifty were travelled on foot. In the Piedmont<br />\nthe party walked from Gordonsville to CharHere they took the train to<br />\nlottesville.<br />\nAfton, which is on the Eastern slope of the<br />\nBlue Ridge. From Afton they walked<br />\nacross the mountain to Basic City, making<br />\na study of the mountain-forming formations.<br />\nThey then traversed the Valley and at Clifton Forge made a careful examination of the<br />\nPaleozaic and later rocks which form the<br />\nimmense and symmetrical anticline which<br />\noccurs there. The region in this vicinity<br />\nproved of especial interest and it is not improbable that one of the students of the<br />\nDepartment of Geology will be detailed next<br />\nsummer to work out the structural problems<br />\nof this section of Virginia. A couple of days<br />\nwere devoted to an examination of the rocks<br />\nto the east of Clifton Forge. A hasty examination was also made of the rocks ex-<br />\n<br />\nposed along the James river at Richmond,<br />\nand the party returned to the University<br />\nafter a week's absence on one of the most<br />\ninteresting field trips that has in recent<br />\nyears been conducted by a Professor of the<br />\nGeological Department.<br />\nEconomic Jottings:\u2014Professor Weber, of<br />\nHeidelberg University, paid a visit to the<br />\nEconomic Seminary a few days ago, and met<br />\nand talked in an informal way with most of<br />\nthe members of the department. Professor<br />\nWeber is one of the brilliant group of German economists who came to this country<br />\nsome weeks ago to attend the Congress of<br />\nArts and Science at St. Louis. Since then<br />\nmost of these scientists have been roaming<br />\nthe country in an endeavor to get some insight into the nature of our economic institutions, such as the trust and the trade<br />\nunion. Above all, they are interested in that<br />\nalien organism transplanted from German<br />\nsoil, the Socialistic or Social Democratic Party. Heretofore, the German writer and philosopher has usually failed to grasp the spirit<br />\nof American institutions. Will our present<br />\nvisitors prove the rule or the exception?

All the way to the<br />\nstation-house he laughed and sang, told his<br />\nblue-coated captors what a fine city Baltimore is to be drunk in, and essayed alcoholic witticisms upon the bedraggled condition of the wretched victim of his blow, who<br />\ncrouched wet and shivering in the forward<br />\ncorner of the patrol wagon.<br />\nBut a night in a cell at the Central brought<br />\na different frame of mind. With the dawn<br />\ncame sobriety and an unpleasant realization<br />\nthat ripe watermelons are not the kind of<br />\ncargo that one can well keep indefinitely<br />\nUpon one's hands; nor, for that matter, that<br />\none cares to leave unguarded at a public<br />\nwharf. Cap'n Bill had just reached Baltimore the afternoon before from a voyage<br />\nup the west coast of the Chesapeake from<br />\nCharles county to Anne Arundel, during<br />\nwhich he had collected a cargo of the best<br />\nMaryland melons. The Cap'n had bought<br />\nthe melons dirt cheap, and their successful<br />\nmarketing meant a neat sum to him. The<br />\nloss of the cargo, on the contrary, would<br />\nleave him worse than penniless, since his jag<br />\nof the day before had been secured from the<br />\nsaloon-keeper on the strength of his prospects. In his eagerness to save the cost of<br />\na supper, he had upon his arrival in port<br />\nat once discharged the lad who, for the sake<br />\nof his passage, had come up the coast with<br /><br />\nB<br /><br />\nhim. Now he cursed himself for a stingy<br />\nfool. No one to sell his perishable cargo<br />\nfor him; no one even to protect it; he himself in prison without a penny to pay a possible fine or a friend to go his bail! Small<br />\nwonder, then, that the unfortunate speculator writhed in his narrow cell and impotently cursed the watermelons, himself, the<br />\npolice, and all the other people and things<br />\nwhich seemed to have conspired to ruin him.<br />\n\"If those melons lie out in the sun for<br />\nsix hours more, even an Eastern Sho' coon<br />\nwould refuse to touch them,\" groaned the<br />\nCap'n. \"Six hours, and I'll probably get<br />\nsix weeks in jail! I'll be lucky ever to see<br />\nthe boat again. Why didn't I go straight<br />\nto the commission merchant's, instead of<br />\nstopping for a drink?\" The Cap'n waved<br />\nhis clenched fists above his great ox-like<br />\nhead with its bleared eyes and shock of red<br />\nhair, and, in a torrent of profanity which<br />\nan oysterman might have envied, gave free<br />\nvent to his anger and self-contempt.<br />\nIf it were only cloudy, he thought in a<br />\ncalmer moment, the fruit might keep through<br />\nthe day\u2014that is if the innumerable loungers,<br />\nblack and white, who swarmed upon the<br />\nwharves, would let any of it remain so long<br />\nunstolen. But through his bars he could<br />\nsee the early beams of the August sun already blistering the floor in the passage-way.<br />\nThen the Cap'n bethought him of the warders. Perhaps they would help him. Surely<br />\nit was not their purpose to make him lose<br />\nhis cargo as well as his liberty. He called<br />\nthem. First in the oily tones he assumed<br />\nwhen buying fruit from the rich farmers<br />\nor selling it again to the still richer commission merchants. Then, getting no response,<br />\nin the gruff voice he used to the men he<br />\nsometimes employed when trade was brisk.<br />\nFinally, completely losing his temper, he<br />\npressed his great shaggy face close to the<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nbars and bellowed in a way that might have<br />\nbeen heard from Fort McHenry to Fort Carroll.<br />\nHow long the Cap'n would have kept up<br />\nthis disturbance it is impossible to say. He<br />\nhad not been at it long when he became<br />\naware of faint sounds in the cell adjoining<br />\nhis. \"Lawd in Hebben! Lawd in Hebben!\"<br />\nrepeated a weak voice in trembling accents,<br />\n\"Save an' defen' us!\"<br />\nThe Cap'n curiosity was aroused. Standing on tiptoe upon the rude cot in his cell,<br />\nhe was able to grasp the curving bars above<br />\nand draw himself up until his eyes were on<br />\na level with the top of the oak partition between the cells. What he saw was a middleaged darkey, fat and terror-stricken, sitting<br />\nupon the edge of a cot, from which he had<br />\napparently just been awakened.<br />\nThe Cap'n struggled with a recollection.<br />\n\"Hi there, Jim Crow,\" he said at last with<br />\na grin. \"Seems to me I remember that breadbasket o' yourn. It ain't punctured?\"<br />\nThe negro's face expressed both relief and<br />\nresentment. \"I thought you must be a line,<br />\ner leastways a tagger, from de noises in dar,\"<br />\nhe began, voicing the former emotion. Then<br />\nyielding to the latter, \"But I don't want to<br />\nhave nothin' more to do with you, suh,\" he<br />\nsaid with dignity.<br />\nThe Cap'n's mirth fairly bubbled over.<br />\n\"Why, you black limb o' Satan\u2014\" he began,<br />\nwhen an inspiration suddenly striking him,<br />\nhe let himself down, piled pillow and bedclothing in a heap on the cot, and mounted<br />\nupon them to continue the conversation more<br />\ncomfortably.<br />\n\"Say, Jim, what are you in here for anyway?\" he questioned eagerly.<br />\n\"For bein' knocked into de water by you.<br />\nYou ought to know,\" replied the negro sullenly.<br />\n\"I thought that was it; but my mind is<br />\nrather confused about yesterday,\" explained<br />\nCap'n Bill. \"I suppose I took a glass or so<br />\ntoo much liquor,\" he confessed. \"But look<br />\nhere, Jim, you're sure to be released this<br />\nmorning as soon as the Judge comes. What<br />\ndo you say to 'tending to some business for<br />\nme at good pay?\"<br />\n\"My name, suh, is Mistah Johnson,\" replied the colored man with dignity, \"and I<br />\nain't gwine to have nothin' to do with you<br />\nor your affairs.\"<br /><br />\nThe lion in the Cap'n's nature struggled<br />\nhard with the serpent, but was finally subdued. \"Look here, Johnson, I'll give you<br />\nfive dollars,\" coaxed the beleaguered mariner.<br />\n\"Mistah\" Johnson vouchsafed no answer.<br />\n\"Ain't no use to try to bribe me,\" said the<br />\nAfrican with fine scorn. \"I'se a local<br />\npreacher.\"<br />\nIn his heart the Cap'n cursed the whole<br />\ntribe of Ham. \"There's no bribing about<br />\nit,\" he urged in despair. \"This is how the<br />\ncase stands. I've five hundred of the best<br />\nwatermelons ever grown in the State lying<br />\nin the sun by the wharf. If they stay there<br />\nmuch longer they won't be worth throwing<br />\naway. You see that they get to Davis Bros.<br />\nby noon and I'll give you fifteen dollars.<br />\nThe judge is sure to release you at once,<br />\nwhile I'm just as sure to get a month or two<br />\nin jail. Last of all, if you won 't agree to<br />\ndo it, I'll swear to the judge that you hit<br />\nme first, and have you sent to jail with me.\"<br />\n\"Mistah\" Johnson scratched his respectable head, and gazed meditatively upon the<br />\nfloor with a glimmer in his eyes of what one<br />\nmight have called cunning if one had not<br />\nknown him to be a local preacher.<br />\n\"You ain't jest de kind of man I likes<br />\nto do business with,\" he answered finally,<br />\n\"but I believe in returning good for evil,<br />\nand for twenty dollars I'll see to them<br />\nmelons.\"<br />\nThe price was a stiff one, but the poor<br />\nskipper was desperate and readily agreed.<br />\nThe negro received from him a paper in lead.<br />\npencil empowering him to act for the Cap'n<br />\nin disposing of the cargo. The melons were<br />\nto be taken as quickly as possible to Davis<br />\nBros., who were to sell them and place the<br />\namonnt, less a commission, to the credit of<br />\nCaptain Bill Watkins. Upon the delivery<br />\nof the melons to Davis Bros., the negro was<br />\nto report to Cap'n Bill at the station-house<br />\nand receive his pay.<br />\nWhen this last clause in the oral contract<br />\nwas agreed upon, Cap'n Bill had to duck<br />\nhis head below the top of the partition to<br />\nhide his satisfaction. \"Much twenty dollars the coon will ever get from me.!\" he<br />\nchuckled gleefully to himself. \"I haven't<br />\na copper about me, and Davis Bros. will be<br />\nholding the melon-money.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nCap'n Bill's plans worked beautifully at come that afternoon. Indeed, he never did<br />\nthe beginning. Upon the Cap'n's confession come. Just thirty days afterwards Cap'n<br />\nthat he alone was to blame for the assault, Bill learned at Davis Bros. that the firm had<br />\nthe sable parson was at once released by the sold a splendid lot of watermelons for a coljustice, and the Cap'n given thirty days in ored farmer of a respectable and rather corjail.

Greatly to his surprise,<br />\nthe time later in the day when the negro the Cap'n found his boat tied just where he<br />\nshould return for his money. \"I'll tell him had left it at the public wharf.

U.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nOwing to a misapprehension at the time<br />\nof our last issue, the NEWS-LETTER was unable to make any editorial comment upon the<br />\nresignation of its Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Morse.<br />\nThe present editors felt, however, that on<br />\naccount of the value of his services and the<br />\ngreat improvement in the NEWS-LETTER under his direction, some acknowledgement of<br />\nhis work is more than ever necessary.<br />\nAs most of our readers probably know,<br />\nthe reason for Mr. Morse's withdrawal from<br />\nthe management of the I\\Nws-Ltrrit,R was to<br />\ndevote himself more fully to the work of<br />\n1905 \"Hullabaloo,\" of which he is chief<br />\neditor.<br />\nThe best proof of a successful editorship<br />\nis a successful paper; and even at the risk of<br />\nappearing boastful, we can not resist the inclination to comment upon the improvement<br />\nin the NEWS-LETTER during Mr. Morse's incumbency. The improved appearance of<br />\nthe paper is too evident to need mention, and<br />\nwe believe that the improvement in subjectmatter is equally apparent. From many<br />\nsources, both in and out of the University,<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER has lately received words<br />\nof commendation. From two such good<br />\nauthorities as the editors of the Harvard and<br />\nthe University of Virginia monthlies it has<br /><br />\nhad messages of direct approval; while even<br />\nfrom so far away as the University of California it has been indirectly informed that<br />\nthe paper is read and appreciated. The increased circulation of the NEWS-LETTER is<br />\nanother good sign of heightened popularity.<br />\nThat this happy state of affairs is largely due<br />\nto the ability, the industry and the good business sense of Mr. Morse, the new management takes pleasure in saying. The departure of Mr. Morse from the chief-editorship<br />\nis viewed with unmixed regret by his colleagues, who wish him equal success with<br />\nthe new interests he is now serving.<br />\nUnder the new management there may be<br />\nsome changes, and probably many mistakes.<br />\nThe present board had not yet served its full<br />\nterm of apprenticeship when Mr. Morse's<br />\npremature resignation occurred, and in the<br />\nordinary course of events they would not<br />\nhave come into control until after Christmas.<br />\nConsequently, the new heads feel that they<br />\nwill have a hard time in trying to keep the<br />\nstandard of the NEWS-LETTER Up to its past<br />\nrecord. All they ask is that their readers<br />\nwill be lenient if they do make mistakes, and<br />\nthey, on their side, in accepting the control<br />\nof the publication, promise that they will do<br />\ntheir best to carry on the work as well as<br />\nit was carried on before them.<br />\nProbably very few of the students of the<br />\nUniversity realize how great credit is due<br />\nto Messrs. Pearre and Straughn for their<br />\nwork in connection with the football team<br />\nthis year. Mr. Pearre accepted the captaincy of the team at a time when no one else<br />\nwas willing to take the risk of the failure<br />\nwhich seemed not unlikely. There were<br />\ngreat difficulties in the way. It was doubtful whether the Athletic Association could<br />\nbe persuaded to recognize the team, or advance money for its expenses, and although<br />\nthere was great enthusiasm expressed among<br />\nthe student body, enthusiasm alone does not<br />\nsupport teams. They need men and money.<br />\nAnother difficulty was the trouble about getting the medical school contingent out in<br />\nforce, owing to their distance from the cage.<br />\nBoth these difficulites Captain Pearre successfully coped with and led the team to an<br />\nalmost unbroken series of victories, in which<br />\nit was only scored on once, when St. John's<br />\ndefeated us by the score of six to five.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThat, however, was in the early days of<br />\nthe team's history, before it had really got<br />\ntogether and begun to play the kind of football that later became identified with it.<br />\nManager Straughn deserves no less credit<br />\nthan Captain Pearre for his work in connection with the team. Although it was rather<br />\nlate in the season when the team was organized, yet the manager arranged an excellent<br />\nseries of games and got some very good dates,<br />\ntoo. Financially the team was a success.<br />\nIt came out at the end of the season with a<br />\nsubstantial balance to its credit after the<br />\nmoney advanced by the Athletic Association<br />\nhad all been paid back. It is due to the<br />\nefforts of Captain Pearre and Manager<br />\nStraughn, backed by the splendid material<br />\nthey got together, that the Athletic Association has no reason to repent of its action in<br />\nrecognizing the team, which in every way<br />\nhas been a credit to its University.<br /><br />\nok,<br /><br />\nIt may not be amiss for the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nto call attention to the fact that there is a<br />\nvacancy on the editorial staff of the paper,<br />\nand that several more will come about somewhat later in the year. Now is the time for<br />\nstudents with a literary turn to try for<br />\nplaces. Freshmen, especially, should interest themselves in this announcement, as the<br />\ngreater length of their future at the University makes them more acceptable material<br />\nthan upper-classmen. Although a number<br />\nof Freshmen (still less than a dozen) are<br />\nalready in the contest, the list of candidates<br />\nis still too short for a class the size of<br />\nNaughty-seven.<br />\nUniversity news, jokes, poetry\u2014anything<br />\noriginal that is short and bright\u2014will count<br />\nin the selection of men for the positions.<br />\nCandidates may write under nomme-dePlumes if they choose; but should always<br />\nsign their real names for the benefit of the<br />\neditors.

Some twelve or fifteen light men<br />\nwere present, and while these were desirous<br />\nof doing what they could to help a team<br />\nalong, the question that confronted them was<br />\nhow to get the big men interested, and how<br />\nto interest the Athletic Board. A temporary<br />\ncaptain and a temporary manager were elected, but nothing was done. It was not, however, their fault. Their bands were tied for<br />\nthey had no authority from anyone to transact business.<br />\nMr. Stuart Janney, an old Hopkins athlete,<br />\nheard of our plight and volunteered to address a mass-meeting of the students. Accordingly, three or four dozen undergraduates met in the trophy room and the entire<br />\nMatters looked<br />\nsituation was discussed.<br />\ngloomy, but Mr. Janney stirred the men to<br />\na high pitch of enthusiasm by saying that if<br />\nnecessary, the alumni would stand by a Hopkins football team. A great deal of trouble<br />\nwas experienced in getting a man to undertake the captaincy. Several men were asked<br />\nand refused. At last, Pea rre said he would<br />\ntry. For this one step, if for nothing else,<br />\nCapt. Pearre deserves the greatest praise<br />\nfrom the student body. Not knowing what<br />\na day might bring forth, he went to work.<br />\nHe visited the medical school and the men<br />\nin the graduate department daily. By earnest pleadings he interested these men, and<br />\nat the first practice there were a considerable number of players anxious to try for<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nthe team. At the next practice the number<br />\nincreased, and in a little while the manager<br />\nhad all he could do to keep the men supplied<br />\nwith clothes. After the season was on in<br />\nearnest, there was scarcely a practice when<br />\nover two fully uniformed teams did not appear in the cage.<br />\nManager Straughn had considerable difficulty in arranging a schedule that was of the<br />\nkind he desired, but, fortunately, the last<br />\nthree games of the season were good drawing cards. The season was a successful one<br />\nfrom almost every point of view. Only once<br />\nduring the entire season was the 'varsity<br />\nscored on. After three days' practice, we<br />\nplayed St. John's College, at Annapolis, and<br />\nthe score ended 6 to 5 in favor of St. John's.<br />\nIn this game Blanck made a beautiful 100yard run for a touchdown, but failed to kick<br />\ngoal. In almost every point of the game<br />\nour boys showed that they were decidedly<br />\nsuperior to their opponents, but the team<br />\nwas in no physical condition and was not yet<br />\nworking together. From that game the team<br />\ntook on form rapidly and not once again during the season did we have any occasion to<br />\nfear defeat. Mt. Washington club, which<br />\nwas fully expected \"to put it all over us,\"<br />\ndecisively defeated, and our old rivals, the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, went down before<br />\nus by the overwhelming score of 23 to 0.<br />\nOn Thanksgivi.ng Day, with a crippled team,<br />\nwe defeated Randolph-Macon by a score of<br />\n6 to 0.<br />\nFinancially the team did very well. Every<br />\ngame up to Mt. Washington rapidly exhausted the appropriation, but here was the<br />\nturning point in finances as well as in the<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwork of the team. The management would<br />\nhave been able to turn over to the association an amount that was in excess of the<br />\nappropriation, but each man on the team will<br />\nbe given a handsome sweater with the official<br />\n\"II\" on it. This necessarily decreases the<br />\nfunds, but not to any great extent.<br />\n\"Sandy\" Randall, who played such a star<br />\ngame at quarter, was elected captain for<br />\nnext year, and the prospects are for the<br />\ngreatest team Hopkins ever saw. On the local gridiron will be seen some of the biggest<br />\nteams in the country.<br />\nHOPKINS, 6; RANDOLPH-MACON 0.<br />\nBefore fully fifteen hundred people, Hopkins downed the Randolph-Macon College<br />\nteam at Oriole Park on Thanksgiving afternoon by the score of 6 to 0, in the last game<br />\nof one of the most successful seasons that any<br />\nHopkins eleven ever had.<br />\nThe University team was handicapped in<br />\nthis contest by the fact that it was without<br />\nthe services of five of its regular players.<br />\nThe substitutes, however, put up a fine garn,e,<br />\nand showed by their hard, consistent playing that there was much good 'varsity material present, which, with a little good training and coaching, could be easily developed.<br />\nThe two teams were about evenly matched,<br />\nthe average weight of the Hopkins team being about three pounds more than that of<br />\nthe Randolph-Macon team. In the first half<br />\nof the game it was \"nip and tuck\" between<br />\nthe two teams, each side finding it hard to<br />\ngain an advantage.<br />\nIn the second half, however, matters took<br />\na different aspect. Randolph-Macon kicked<br />\noff to Hopkins, who carried the ball back to<br />\nthe 40-yd line where she lost on a fumble.<br />\nRandolph-Macon, in turn, was held for<br />\ndowns, and kicked to Hopkins' 15-yd line.<br />\nAt this point, however, Hopkins took a brace,<br />\nand seemed to make holes in her opponents'<br />\nline at will. Blanck, Betts, and McDonnell<br />\nwere sent through line for consistent gains<br />\nof five, ten, and fifteen yards each, and withm seven minutes Blanck was pushed across<br />\nthe line for the only touchdown. He was<br />\nsuccessful in kicking goal.<br />\nThe half ended soon after, with the ball<br />\non Hopkins' 45-yd line. One feature of this<br />\nhalf, and of the game in fact, was the 90-yd<br />\nrun of Iglehart for a touchdown; which, how-<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\never, was not allowed as one of the Hopkins'<br />\nteam was offside.<br />\nEvery man on the team played a hard,<br />\ndashing game. Blanck, at right halfback,<br />\nplayed up to his old form; and Betts, left<br />\nhalfback, and McDonnell, fullback, played a<br />\nsplendid game ,showing themselves to be consistent gainers, as they had in all the games<br />\nof this season. Boyce was very efficient at<br />\nright end, as were Kelley and Stone at tackle,<br />\nCrothers and Eichelberger at guard, and .<br />\nPreble at centre.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\nRandolph-Macon.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nDavis<br />\nLeft end<br />\nBoyce<br />\nMast<br />\nLeft tackle<br />\nKelley<br />\nMills<br />\nLeft guard<br />\nCrothers<br />\nJames<br />\nCentre<br />\nPreble<br />\nPhilpotts<br />\nRight guard<br />\nStone<br />\nLeavell<br />\nBenton<br />\nRight tackle<br />\nRight end<br />\nSmith<br />\nStewart<br />\nQuarterback<br />\n.Randolph<br />\nIglehart<br />\nhalfback<br />\nLeft<br />\nSchenk<br />\nBetts<br />\nBlanck (capt.)....Right halfback...Walters (capt.)<br />\nMcDonnell<br />\nFullback<br />\nThrasher<br />\nOfficials\u2014Bray (Lafayette), referee; Hart (Georgetown University), umpire.

Time<br />\nof halves\u2014Twenty minutes.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 23; U. OF M., 0.<br />\nThe University of Maryland football team\u2014<br />\n\"our greatest rival on the local gridiron\"\u2014<br />\nwent nobly down to defeat before Hopkins'<br />\ntrained eleven, on Saturday Nov. 19, at Oriole Park. The last time we played Maryland<br />\ntwo years ago, a score of 6-0 was made<br />\nagainst us, but retaliation was complete at<br />\nthis game when we rolled up a score of 23-0<br />\nin our favor. The result was surprising, for<br />\nalthough we were sanguine of success, every<br />\none thought the score would be closer. The<br />\nfive hundred followers of black and red fairly gasped at the relentless persistence with<br />\nwhich the lads in black and blue crossed their<br />\nline.<br />\nThe well-known rivalry between the two<br />\nteams, together with fine weather, brought<br />\nout a crowd of over a thousand persons to<br />\nsee the game. The Hopkins colors were unfurled on the west stand, and the Maryland<br />\nrooters, with a concise abbreviation of a<br />\nbrass band, rallied on the east stand. Many<br />\nladies, wearing the colors of either University, occupied the grand-stand. Promptly at<br />\n3.30 our team trotted out on the field, and fifteen minutes later they were followed by the<br />\nMaryland eleven. During the interim re-<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncoired for the formalities of the toss-up, the<br />\nrooters from either side of the gridiron<br />\nhurled their defiant yells.<br />\nIIopkins won the kick-off, and Randall<br />\nsent the ball to Watts, the Maryland fullback. The latter succeeded in reaching the<br />\n20-yd line, but the oval went no further.<br />\nHopkins got the ball on downs, but an attempted \"fake\" pass lost us the ball on a<br />\nfumble. Cheered by this, Maryland took a<br />\nbrace, and by repeated plunges, Watts and<br />\nStone forced the battle back to the centre of<br />\nthe field. The fine tackling of Boyce and<br />\nStewart, together with the splendid blocking<br />\nof Crothers and Kellam, soon began to tell,<br />\nhowever, and, taking a larger dose of the<br />\nsame bracer, Hopkins procured the ball. Then<br />\nthe hammering began in earnest. For about<br />\nten minutes Maryland had \"cannon to the<br />\nright, left, and front of them.\" Blanck and<br />\nWorthington were the guns in front, and<br />\nthey \"volleyed and thundered\" without stop<br />\nuntil they carried their opponents back over<br />\ntheir goal line for the first touchdown. Randall made the score 6-0 by kicking goal.<br />\nPluckily the Maryland boys responded to the<br />\nencouragements of their rooters, and the 40yd run of Brent, their captain, called forth<br />\nThe half<br />\nthe admiration of both sides.<br />\nbeing<br />\nscore<br />\nthe<br />\nwithout<br />\nended, however,<br />\nchanged.<br />\nDuring the intermission the Hopkins rooters in ranks of four paraded about the field<br />\nfollowing the Black and Blue banner, which<br />\nwas guarded on either side by our two gridiron cripples, Morse and MacSherry. New<br />\nsongs had been arranged for the occasion<br />\nby Mr. Griswold, Chief Rooter, and the<br />\ngrand-stand Was demonstrative in its appreciation.<br />\nIn the second half Maryland did not once<br />\nsucceed in making the first down. Fired<br />\nwith the success of the first half our boys,<br />\nwith common impulse, hurled themselves<br />\nmercilessly on the opposing line. Relying<br />\nsolely on line-plunges, Blanck, McDonnell,<br />\nand Worthington were alternately sent<br />\nthrough for gains of five yards each until<br />\nMcDonnell ploughed through Maryland's defense for another touchdown. Again Randall kicked goal. Maryland's third kick-off<br />\nsent the ball to Blanck, and the line-plunging<br />\ntactics were repeated by our backs. In a<br />\nshort time Maryland's line gave out under<br /><br />\nthe terrific hammering and the ball was carried over for our third touchdown. Goal<br />\nwas again kicked. We then kicked off to<br />\nMaryland but held them for downs, and they<br />\nwere obliged to punt. Randall caught the<br />\nball and by means of clever dodging, warmed<br />\nhimself with a good run into Maryland's territory. By the same line-bucking Worthington gained the fourth touchdown. Day darkened with the spirits of the rooters on the<br />\neast stand, and on this account time was<br />\ncalled with ten more minutes of play.<br />\nAfter the game the Hopkins rooters again<br />\nformed in line and paraded from the grounds<br />\ndown to the cage, where each man of the<br />\nteam was given a rousing cheer.<br />\nThe winning of this game gives us right<br />\nto claim the collegiate championship of the<br />\nState, since we have downed much stronger<br />\nteams than has St. John's College, the- only<br />\ncollege which has won from us this season.<br />\nMuch discussion has even been caused in<br />\nfootball circles as to whether we can not<br />\nclaim superiority over the Maryland Athletic<br />\nteam, which lost to Mt.

Very<br />\nsoon, however, they fumbled; and this, happening so early in the game, seemed to take<br />\nthe life out of them.<br />\nThis fumble occurred on the 32-yd line,<br />\nand a few minutes after the Freshmen, by<br />\na quarterback run of Iglehart and a line<br />\nplunge of Hartman took the ball over for<br />\nthe first touchdown. Raleigh kicked goal.<br />\nOn the next kick-off, the advantage was<br />\nwith first one side and then the other. At<br />\none time, the Juniors held the Freshmen for<br />\ndowns on their own 9-yd line. The Juniors<br />\nthen carried the ball back to their 26-yd line<br />\nwhere they lost on downs. On regaining the<br />\nball, the Freshmen took it back over the<br />\nground they had lost, and in a short time<br />\nhad shoved Stewart over the line for a second touchdown.<br />\nRaleigh failed at an easy goal, leaving the<br />\nscore at the end of the half 11 to 0.<br />\nIn the second half, the Juniors got the ball<br />\non a fumble on the Freshmen's 22-yd line<br />\nafter a short time of play. With the ball<br />\nin their possession, the Juniors, by gains of<br />\n3 to 5 yards each by Mengel, Meyer, and<br />\nGriffith, worked the ball down the field to<br />\nthe Freshmen's one-yard line. On the next<br />\nline down, the ball was given to Griffith,<br />\nwho, by making a beautiful hurdle, crossed<br />\nthe line for the Juniors' only touchdown.<br />\nMengel failed to make a goal.<br />\nOn the following kick-off, Iglehart ran the<br />\nball back to the 37-yd line; and, from this<br />\npoint on, by hard line plunges advanced the<br />\nball down the field, and pushed Werekshagen<br />\nover the line \u2022 for their last touchdown.<br />\nRaleigh kicked goal.<br />\nThe cane rush followed immediately after<br />\nthe game. In this event the Juniors evened<br />\nup with the Freshmen for the defeat in football. The sides were allowed to fight for<br /><br />\nthe cane for one minute. At the end of this<br />\ntime the hands on the cane were counted and<br />\nit was found that the Juniors had won by<br />\n9 hands to 5 for the Freshmen.<br />\nIt was evident from the begnining that<br />\nthe Juniors would win this event, for when<br />\nthe whistle was blown for the struggle to<br />\nbegin, Mengel, who held the cane for the<br />\nJuniors, pulled Raleigh across the line into<br />\nthe juniors' territory, thereby giving the<br />\nJuniors a better chance to win.<br />\nThose having hands on the cane were:<br />\nJuniors.<br />\nMengel<br />\nHolly Smith<br />\nHill<br />\nGunts<br />\nRevell<br />\nEdlaviteh<br /><br />\nFreshmen.<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nRaleigh 2<br />\nSehmeisser 2<br />\nBranham 1<br />\nTotal 5<br /><br />\nTotal 9<br /><br />\nORIGINAL JOKES.<br />\n'07--Who gave the Homewood estate to<br />\nHopkins?<br />\n'06\u2014W(h)y, man, don't you know?<br /><br />\nDean (sternly)\u2014Why were you absent<br />\nfrom minor French, last week?<br />\nStudent\u2014Oh, I took French leave, for an<br />\nEaster holiday, sir!<br /><br />\nEnraptured Poet\u2014What a shining face h:.61<br />\nyonder lad!<br />\nProsaic Friend\u2014Yes, he's a boot-black.<br /><br />\nA gilded youth in evening dress\u2014<br />\nA beggar man in something less\u2014<br />\n\"A match, kind sir,\" the poor man said;<br />\nThe ehappie turned his lordly head:<br />\n\"Oh, calm 't yuh see I am matchless?\"<br /><br />\nThe bulbul hummeth like a brook<br />\nUpon the pooh-pooh tree.<br />\nAnd now and then he takes a look<br />\nAt you and me,<br />\nAt me and you.<br />\nKuchi!<br />\nKuchoo!<br />\nOwen Seaman.<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE GRADUATE DEPARTMENTS.<br />\nIn a recent trip made through Virginia by<br />\nDr. Edward Mathews, and two of the students of his department, Messrs. Grasty and<br />\nVanderhorst, an attempt was made to interpret and correlate its Piedmont formations<br />\nwith those of Maryland. The trip was more<br />\nor less in the nature of a reconnaissance, but<br />\nwas successful in as much as it substantiated<br />\nseveral of the theories of Dr. Mathews, who<br />\nis considered an authority on the Piedmont,<br />\nhaving devoted the past ten years to the<br />\nstudy of its intricate and complex problems.<br />\nIn the spring he will go to North Carolina<br />\nand there study and trace out the same formations. The results of his investigations<br />\nwill doubtless be published by the North<br />\nCarolina State Survey, under whose auspices<br />\nthe work is to be done.<br />\nOf the more than 700 miles travelled, over<br />\nfifty were travelled on foot. In the Piedmont<br />\nthe party walked from Gordonsville to CharHere they took the train to<br />\nlottesville.<br />\nAfton, which is on the Eastern slope of the<br />\nBlue Ridge. From Afton they walked<br />\nacross the mountain to Basic City, making<br />\na study of the mountain-forming formations.<br />\nThey then traversed the Valley and at Clifton Forge made a careful examination of the<br />\nPaleozaic and later rocks which form the<br />\nimmense and symmetrical anticline which<br />\noccurs there. The region in this vicinity<br />\nproved of especial interest and it is not improbable that one of the students of the<br />\nDepartment of Geology will be detailed next<br />\nsummer to work out the structural problems<br />\nof this section of Virginia. A couple of days<br />\nwere devoted to an examination of the rocks<br />\nto the east of Clifton Forge. A hasty examination was also made of the rocks ex-<br /><br />\nposed along the James river at Richmond,<br />\nand the party returned to the University<br />\nafter a week's absence on one of the most<br />\ninteresting field trips that has in recent<br />\nyears been conducted by a Professor of the<br />\nGeological Department.<br />\nEconomic Jottings:\u2014Professor Weber, of<br />\nHeidelberg University, paid a visit to the<br />\nEconomic Seminary a few days ago, and met<br />\nand talked in an informal way with most of<br />\nthe members of the department. Professor<br />\nWeber is one of the brilliant group of German economists who came to this country<br />\nsome weeks ago to attend the Congress of<br />\nArts and Science at St. Louis. Since then<br />\nmost of these scientists have been roaming<br />\nthe country in an endeavor to get some insight into the nature of our economic institutions, such as the trust and the trade<br />\nunion. Above all, they are interested in that<br />\nalien organism transplanted from German<br />\nsoil, the Socialistic or Social Democratic Party. Heretofore, the German writer and philosopher has usually failed to grasp the spirit<br />\nof American institutions. Will our present<br />\nvisitors prove the rule or the exception?
