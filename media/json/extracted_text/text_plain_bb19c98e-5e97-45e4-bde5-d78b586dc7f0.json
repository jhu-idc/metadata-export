Only four long shots were<br />\nattempted throughout the fracas,<br />\nthree by Cline\u00b0, all of which<br />\nfailed, and one by Weiner,,which<br />\nfound its mark.<br />\n\"Joe\" Weiner, who was the<br />\nprincipal offender on this point<br />\nlast Friday, pushed himself heroically to the rear, watching closely to find a man free, to whom<br />\nhe shot the leather, only once<br />\nobeying the impulse to try a howitzer shot, which luckily hit the<br />\ntarget.

The<br />\nsubject for the debate was, \"Resolved, that Baltimore should<br />\nadopt the city manager plan of<br />\ngovernment\" \u2014 the spohomores<br />\nrepresenting the affirmative and<br />\nthe freshmen the negative.<br />\nAfter a short introduction by<br />\nDr. French, the presiding officer,<br />\nM. S. Cotton, who opened the debate for the sophomores, stated<br />\nthat as the city manager plan of<br />\ngovernment does not cause any<br />\nfriction between the officials of a<br />\ncity, as politics do not play any<br />\npart in this form of municipal<br />\ngovernment, and as this system<br />\nsaves a great deal of money, the<br />\ncity of Baltimore ought to adopt<br />\nit.<br />\nA. D. Emmart, the first speaker<br />\nfor the negative, outlined the argument for the freshmen. The evidence on which the negative based<br />\nits arguments was as follows:<br />\nThe government of Baltimore, as<br />\nnow constituted, is efficient; the<br />\ncity manager plan incurs great<br />\ndangers; and this form of government is opposed to American<br />\nideals of representation. Emmart, himself, endeavored to prove<br />\nthe first of them, and P. C. Williams, the second speaker for the<br />\nfreshmen, endeavored to prove<br />\nthe other two. The principal<br />\npoints which they brought out<br />\nwere the citing of several instances, where western cities had<br />\ntried to make use of the city manager plan of government, which<br />\nfailed through the impracticability of the plan, due to the corruptness of the executive body. They<br />\nalso asserted that as this system<br />\nplaces so much power in the hands<br />\nof one person and as it abolishes<br />\nthe award system, it is at variance<br />\nwith American ideals of representation.<br />\nB. S. Carman the second speaker<br />\nfor the sophomores, backed up the<br />\nassertions made by his colleague,<br />\nby saying that lack of ability, both<br />\ntechnical and administrative, and<br />\nlack of centralized authority and<br />\nco-operation is everywhere in evidence in Baltimore's present system of government. A business<br />\ncould not be run in such a manner, people would not buy stock<br />\nin a corporation run in such a<br />\nmanner, and yet the people of Baltimore, which is a vast corporation and which must be run as an<br />\n<br />\nAt a recent meeting of the Dramatic Club the future activities<br />\nof the club were decided upon.,<br />\n\"The Admirable Crichton\" will<br />\nagain be presented sometime between Easter and May 1, the final<br />\ndate to be chosen later, thus giving all who were unable to attend<br />\nthe Christmas production an opportunity to see the play. In<br />\nbringing \"The Admirable Crichton\" before the public once more<br />\nthe club is yeilding to the entreaties of its many friends, both those<br />\nWho did and those who did not see<br />\nthe first performance, and is relying upon the co-operation of<br />\nthose interested in the activities<br />\nof the University in general, or<br />\nthe work of the club in particular, to assure it a second successful presentation.<br />\nIn order that the club might<br />\nnot remain stationary in its enrollment and the active interest<br />\nof the student body thereby languish, it was decided to present,<br />\nsometime before Easter, a series<br />\nof one-act plays, two or three in<br />\nnumber, one of which, if possible,<br />\nto be written by a member of the<br />\nUniversity. Insofar as is practical the preference in the selection<br />\nof the casts of these plays will be<br />\ngiven to new men\u2014\"undeveloped<br />\ntalent,\" as it were. Thus the club,<br />\nlooking into the future, particularly urges all under-classmen who<br />\nin any way think themselves qualified for this sort of work to be on<br />\nhand when the call is made for<br />\ntry-outs.<br />\nParticipation in these plays will<br />\ncount as usual toward membership in the club, although it is<br />\nintended to present them to a limited audience in some hall in<br />\ntown \u2014 the one above the Lyric<br />\nhaving been suggested.<br />\nThe preparation of this series of<br />\nsmall plays marks the entrance of<br />\nthe club into a new phase of its<br />\nactivity, the acting of plays written by Hopkins men, for it is<br />\nhoped that the first of this series<br />\nwill be a true Hopkins play, in<br />\norigin as well as in presentation.<br />\nIn order to accomplish this aspiration the club must have many<br />\nmanuscripts to enable it to select<br />\na play suitable to its needs. The<br />\nco-operation of the Literary Club<br />\nhas been gained and a special appeal will be made through it to<br />\nthe element most likely to be interested.

Mr. Murphy announced the favorable feeling of<br />\nthe Athletic Board on this matter<br />\nand said it was now up to the students to decide whether they<br />\nwished to adopt boxing as a regular sport or not. The National<br />\nInter-collegiate Association has<br />\ngiven its sanction to boxing and<br />\nit has been instituted in eleven<br />\nlarge colleges.<br />\nIf Hopkins should develop a<br />\nboxing team, our example would<br />\nprobably be followed in nearby<br />\ncolleges and we could have boxing tournaments with them as<br />\nwell as the usual contests.

The audience was small,<br />\nbut what it lacked in numbers it<br />\nmade up in enthusiasm and appreciation. This was the first of<br />\na series of lectures to be given by<br />\nthe club and it was most fitting<br />\nthat Edward Lucas White, a Hopkins alumnus and a novelist of no<br />\nsmall repute (his \"El Supremo\"<br />\ntook the first prize for its year)<br />\nshould sponsor the initial literary<br />\nventure of the University. Mr.<br />\nWhite's interesting personality<br />\nand exuberant humor added much<br />\nto the zest and sparkle of the lecture, the subject of which was<br />\n\"Free Verse and Kindred Forms<br />\nof Expression.\"<br />\nMr. White, after relating the<br />\nfree verse movement to the whole<br />\nbody of English and European literature, and showing that from<br />\nHomer down the art of writing<br />\npoetry is essentially the same,<br />\nsaid in part:<br />\n\"The free verse writers have the<br />\nambition to compose verse, but<br />\nhave not the ability to get around<br />\nthe limitations of a set form. Set<br />\nforms to the natural poet are not<br />\nbonds, but are more like greased<br />\ngrooves on which to slide their<br />\nverses. Free verse writers are to<br />\nbe excused because of two great<br />\nfallacies:.First, the pioneering fallacy of not learning all the learning of the age, because it dims<br />\noriginality; secondly, the democratic fallacy of letting democracy<br />\nin spirit and speech run rampant.<br />\nFree verse does not think apprenticeship necessary. The task of<br />\nthe poet should be to have something to say\u2014to say it forcibly<br />\nand beautifully. Most of the<br />\nwriters of free verse have nothing<br />\nor very little to say. Some of it<br />\nis very forceful and has a real<br />\npang of revelation of character<br />\nand situation in it. The free verse<br />\nmovement is not a normal, healthy<br />\ngrowth, but is like a wen on the<br />\nside of a man's head or a pimple<br />\non the nose. It is going to pass<br />\naway like Pope's couplets. I am<br />\nastonished that there is a free<br />\nverse movement from the point of<br />\nview of a student of English prosody, because of the variety of verse<br />\nforms that have not been practiced.

Prof. Joseph Sweetman Ames, president of the American Physical Society and<br />\n-head of our Department of Physics, naturally<br />\nchose \"Einstein's Theory of Gravitation\" as<br />\nthe subject of the annual address at the joint<br />\nmeeting of the American Physical Society and<br />\nthe American Association for the Advancement<br />\nof Science at St. Louis on Tuesday, December<br />\n30, 1919. The paper which he read will soon<br />\nappear in the Physical Review.]<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Albert Einstein was<br />\nborn in Switzerland. For a time<br />\nhe was connected with the Berne<br />\nPatent Office. He became Professor of Mathematical Physics at<br />\nthe Technical Institute at Zurich.<br />\nLater he taught at the University<br />\nof Prague and in 1914 he was<br />\ncalled to'<br />\nBerlin, where he was<br />\ngiven a research professorship at<br />\nthe Emperor William Institute.<br />\nThere he devotes his time entirely<br />\nto research work. Professor Einstein was one of the professors<br />\nwho protested against the manifesto of the German professors at<br />\nthe outbreak of the recent war.<br />\nProfessor Ames is recognized<br />\nby his American colleagues as an<br />\nauthority on the much-discussed<br />\ntheory. Upon the suggestion of<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER he cheerfully<br />\ncontributed the following article:<br />\nIn developing his formulae for<br />\ngravitation Einstein was not attempting to find some mathematical statement which would express the facts of observation of<br />\nastronomy. This path was followed by Newton, who proved<br />\nthat Kepler's laws concerning the<br />\nmotions of the planets and his<br />\nown observations of gravity due<br />\nto the earth were all comprised in<br />\na simple formula, now known as<br />\n\"Newton's laws of universal gravitation.\" Einstein, on the contrary, started with certain simple<br />\npostulates; that is, certain general properties of phenomena, so<br />\nsimple and 80 in accord with universal experience as to be accepted by all.' Then from these he<br />\nmade deductions by means of<br />\nmathematical processes.<br />\nIn order to describe the motion<br />\nof a body we must refer to another body; thus the motion of a'<br />\nstreet car is described with reference to the ground. In geometry,<br />\nand therefore in physics, the<br />\n\"bodies\" to which motions in<br />\nspace are referred are called systems of axes, or as-ordinate systems, e. g. 'the position of a point,<br />\nand, therefore, its motion may be<br />\ndescribed with reference to the<br />\nthee lines meeting in the corner<br />\nof a room. Einstein's postulates,<br />\nthen, are as follows: .<br />\n\u2022 \"1. Every law of nature which<br />\nholds gool holds good with re<br />\nspect to a co-ordinate system K<br />\nmust also hold gr.ad for any other<br />\nsystem TV, provisled that K and<br />\nK1 are in uniform movement of<br />\ntranslation.<br />\n\"2.

It now means a proletarian dictatorship established by<br />\nforce and imposed upon tht majority of the people. About 90<br />\nper cent. of the European continental Socialists are standing for<br />\nproletarian dictatorship. The old<br />\nintellectual leaders of the Syndicalists, Socialists and Anarchists<br />\nhave almost all repudiated Bolshevism. They believe in constructive revolution rather than<br />\nin the Bolshevist destructive revolution. \"But,\" said Mr. Walling,<br />\n\"the intellectual leaders have been<br />\nreplaced by the bourgeoise Socialist leaders with no knowledge or<br />\nreal interest in economic realities.\" Bolshevism is not a real political party, but is a social class<br />\n-a sect-with a tribal god that<br />\ntells them to destroy all that<br />\nstands in their way. The Bolshevists are striving for power regardless of principles. They are particularly uncompromising with all<br />\ndemocratic forces, because democ-<br />\n<br />\nMONDAY.

Music<br />\nhas proved a tremendous militant<br />\nforce during the war and indispensable to our soldiers and sailors. There is a far greater need<br />\nfor music now in the reconstruction period after the war, and<br />\nleading business and professional<br />\nmen must realize that no city,<br />\nhowever progressive from a commercial standpoint, can become a<br />\ngreat metropolis unless a liberal<br />\npatronage is given to the arts.<br />\nMany smaller cities\u2014Detroit, Cincinnati, St. Louis, San Francisco<br />\n\u2014support splendid orchestras and<br />\nsend them out on annual tours, advertising their cities far and wide.<br />\n\"This is what I want to see accomplished for our symphony orchestra and then there is another<br />\nhobby in which I am deeply interested\u2014it is a desire to see an<br />\nendowed department of music at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nwith courses of study, lectures,<br />\nrecitals and concerts\u2014and accommodations for a large chorus and<br />\norchestra.\"<br />\nAfter graduating from Hopkins<br />\nin 1893, Mr. Turnbull went to<br />\nEurope to study music. While<br />\nthere he composed his first orchestral composition, and dedicated it to the amateur orchestra he<br />\nhad founded in America. In 1894<br />\nhe returned to this country and<br />\nentered the real estate business,<br />\nremaining in it ever since. During all that time he kept his interest in music and participated<br />\nin many concerts, recitals and musicals as conductor, violinist and<br />\nmanager. He also sang in male<br />\nquartets. Last spring he conducted Pershing's Band, when it<br />\nplayed his military march, \"Victory,\" at the Fifth Regiment Armory.

The<br />\nsubject for the debate was, \"Resolved, that Baltimore should<br />\nadopt the city manager plan of<br />\ngovernment\" \u2014 the spohomores<br />\nrepresenting the affirmative and<br />\nthe freshmen the negative.<br />\nAfter a short introduction by<br />\nDr. French, the presiding officer,<br />\nM. S. Cotton, who opened the debate for the sophomores, stated<br />\nthat as the city manager plan of<br />\ngovernment does not cause any<br />\nfriction between the officials of a<br />\ncity, as politics do not play any<br />\npart in this form of municipal<br />\ngovernment, and as this system<br />\nsaves a great deal of money, the<br />\ncity of Baltimore ought to adopt<br />\nit.<br />\nA. D. Emmart, the first speaker<br />\nfor the negative, outlined the argument for the freshmen. The evidence on which the negative based<br />\nits arguments was as follows:<br />\nThe government of Baltimore, as<br />\nnow constituted, is efficient; the<br />\ncity manager plan incurs great<br />\ndangers; and this form of government is opposed to American<br />\nideals of representation. Emmart, himself, endeavored to prove<br />\nthe first of them, and P. C. Williams, the second speaker for the<br />\nfreshmen, endeavored to prove<br />\nthe other two. The principal<br />\npoints which they brought out<br />\nwere the citing of several instances, where western cities had<br />\ntried to make use of the city manager plan of government, which<br />\nfailed through the impracticability of the plan, due to the corruptness of the executive body. They<br />\nalso asserted that as this system<br />\nplaces so much power in the hands<br />\nof one person and as it abolishes<br />\nthe award system, it is at variance<br />\nwith American ideals of representation.<br />\nB. S. Carman the second speaker<br />\nfor the sophomores, backed up the<br />\nassertions made by his colleague,<br />\nby saying that lack of ability, both<br />\ntechnical and administrative, and<br />\nlack of centralized authority and<br />\nco-operation is everywhere in evidence in Baltimore's present system of government. A business<br />\ncould not be run in such a manner, people would not buy stock<br />\nin a corporation run in such a<br />\nmanner, and yet the people of Baltimore, which is a vast corporation and which must be run as an<br /><br />\nAt a recent meeting of the Dramatic Club the future activities<br />\nof the club were decided upon.,<br />\n\"The Admirable Crichton\" will<br />\nagain be presented sometime between Easter and May 1, the final<br />\ndate to be chosen later, thus giving all who were unable to attend<br />\nthe Christmas production an opportunity to see the play. In<br />\nbringing \"The Admirable Crichton\" before the public once more<br />\nthe club is yeilding to the entreaties of its many friends, both those<br />\nWho did and those who did not see<br />\nthe first performance, and is relying upon the co-operation of<br />\nthose interested in the activities<br />\nof the University in general, or<br />\nthe work of the club in particular, to assure it a second successful presentation.<br />\nIn order that the club might<br />\nnot remain stationary in its enrollment and the active interest<br />\nof the student body thereby languish, it was decided to present,<br />\nsometime before Easter, a series<br />\nof one-act plays, two or three in<br />\nnumber, one of which, if possible,<br />\nto be written by a member of the<br />\nUniversity. Insofar as is practical the preference in the selection<br />\nof the casts of these plays will be<br />\ngiven to new men\u2014\"undeveloped<br />\ntalent,\" as it were. Thus the club,<br />\nlooking into the future, particularly urges all under-classmen who<br />\nin any way think themselves qualified for this sort of work to be on<br />\nhand when the call is made for<br />\ntry-outs.<br />\nParticipation in these plays will<br />\ncount as usual toward membership in the club, although it is<br />\nintended to present them to a limited audience in some hall in<br />\ntown \u2014 the one above the Lyric<br />\nhaving been suggested.<br />\nThe preparation of this series of<br />\nsmall plays marks the entrance of<br />\nthe club into a new phase of its<br />\nactivity, the acting of plays written by Hopkins men, for it is<br />\nhoped that the first of this series<br />\nwill be a true Hopkins play, in<br />\norigin as well as in presentation.<br />\nIn order to accomplish this aspiration the club must have many<br />\nmanuscripts to enable it to select<br />\na play suitable to its needs. The<br />\nco-operation of the Literary Club<br />\nhas been gained and a special appeal will be made through it to<br />\nthe element most likely to be interested.

Mr. Murphy announced the favorable feeling of<br />\nthe Athletic Board on this matter<br />\nand said it was now up to the students to decide whether they<br />\nwished to adopt boxing as a regular sport or not. The National<br />\nInter-collegiate Association has<br />\ngiven its sanction to boxing and<br />\nit has been instituted in eleven<br />\nlarge colleges.<br />\nIf Hopkins should develop a<br />\nboxing team, our example would<br />\nprobably be followed in nearby<br />\ncolleges and we could have boxing tournaments with them as<br />\nwell as the usual contests. Maryland State already has a team<br />\nand is very anxious to stage a<br />\ntournament with us.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Murphy, we<br />\nhave now three or four experienced boxers and with the bringing to light of a few \"dark<br />\nhorses\" we could be very credibly<br />\nrepresented in this branch of athletics.<br />\nMr. Murphy explained that it<br />\nwould be necessary for the students to show considerable interest in boxing in order to win the<br />\nrecognition of the A.

The audience was small,<br />\nbut what it lacked in numbers it<br />\nmade up in enthusiasm and appreciation. This was the first of<br />\na series of lectures to be given by<br />\nthe club and it was most fitting<br />\nthat Edward Lucas White, a Hopkins alumnus and a novelist of no<br />\nsmall repute (his \"El Supremo\"<br />\ntook the first prize for its year)<br />\nshould sponsor the initial literary<br />\nventure of the University. Mr.<br />\nWhite's interesting personality<br />\nand exuberant humor added much<br />\nto the zest and sparkle of the lecture, the subject of which was<br />\n\"Free Verse and Kindred Forms<br />\nof Expression.\"<br />\nMr. White, after relating the<br />\nfree verse movement to the whole<br />\nbody of English and European literature, and showing that from<br />\nHomer down the art of writing<br />\npoetry is essentially the same,<br />\nsaid in part:<br />\n\"The free verse writers have the<br />\nambition to compose verse, but<br />\nhave not the ability to get around<br />\nthe limitations of a set form. Set<br />\nforms to the natural poet are not<br />\nbonds, but are more like greased<br />\ngrooves on which to slide their<br />\nverses. Free verse writers are to<br />\nbe excused because of two great<br />\nfallacies:.First, the pioneering fallacy of not learning all the learning of the age, because it dims<br />\noriginality; secondly, the democratic fallacy of letting democracy<br />\nin spirit and speech run rampant.<br />\nFree verse does not think apprenticeship necessary. The task of<br />\nthe poet should be to have something to say\u2014to say it forcibly<br />\nand beautifully. Most of the<br />\nwriters of free verse have nothing<br />\nor very little to say. Some of it<br />\nis very forceful and has a real<br />\npang of revelation of character<br />\nand situation in it. The free verse<br />\nmovement is not a normal, healthy<br />\ngrowth, but is like a wen on the<br />\nside of a man's head or a pimple<br />\non the nose. It is going to pass<br />\naway like Pope's couplets. I am<br />\nastonished that there is a free<br />\nverse movement from the point of<br />\nview of a student of English prosody, because of the variety of verse<br />\nforms that have not been practiced.

Prof. Joseph Sweetman Ames, president of the American Physical Society and<br />\n-head of our Department of Physics, naturally<br />\nchose \"Einstein's Theory of Gravitation\" as<br />\nthe subject of the annual address at the joint<br />\nmeeting of the American Physical Society and<br />\nthe American Association for the Advancement<br />\nof Science at St. Louis on Tuesday, December<br />\n30, 1919. The paper which he read will soon<br />\nappear in the Physical Review.]<br /><br />\nProfessor Albert Einstein was<br />\nborn in Switzerland. For a time<br />\nhe was connected with the Berne<br />\nPatent Office. He became Professor of Mathematical Physics at<br />\nthe Technical Institute at Zurich.<br />\nLater he taught at the University<br />\nof Prague and in 1914 he was<br />\ncalled to'<br />\nBerlin, where he was<br />\ngiven a research professorship at<br />\nthe Emperor William Institute.<br />\nThere he devotes his time entirely<br />\nto research work. Professor Einstein was one of the professors<br />\nwho protested against the manifesto of the German professors at<br />\nthe outbreak of the recent war.<br />\nProfessor Ames is recognized<br />\nby his American colleagues as an<br />\nauthority on the much-discussed<br />\ntheory. Upon the suggestion of<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER he cheerfully<br />\ncontributed the following article:<br />\nIn developing his formulae for<br />\ngravitation Einstein was not attempting to find some mathematical statement which would express the facts of observation of<br />\nastronomy. This path was followed by Newton, who proved<br />\nthat Kepler's laws concerning the<br />\nmotions of the planets and his<br />\nown observations of gravity due<br />\nto the earth were all comprised in<br />\na simple formula, now known as<br />\n\"Newton's laws of universal gravitation.\" Einstein, on the contrary, started with certain simple<br />\npostulates; that is, certain general properties of phenomena, so<br />\nsimple and 80 in accord with universal experience as to be accepted by all.' Then from these he<br />\nmade deductions by means of<br />\nmathematical processes.<br />\nIn order to describe the motion<br />\nof a body we must refer to another body; thus the motion of a'<br />\nstreet car is described with reference to the ground. In geometry,<br />\nand therefore in physics, the<br />\n\"bodies\" to which motions in<br />\nspace are referred are called systems of axes, or as-ordinate systems, e. g. 'the position of a point,<br />\nand, therefore, its motion may be<br />\ndescribed with reference to the<br />\nthee lines meeting in the corner<br />\nof a room. Einstein's postulates,<br />\nthen, are as follows: .<br />\n\u2022 \"1. Every law of nature which<br />\nholds gool holds good with re<br />\nspect to a co-ordinate system K<br />\nmust also hold gr.ad for any other<br />\nsystem TV, provisled that K and<br />\nK1 are in uniform movement of<br />\ntranslation.<br />\n\"2.

It now means a proletarian dictatorship established by<br />\nforce and imposed upon tht majority of the people. About 90<br />\nper cent. of the European continental Socialists are standing for<br />\nproletarian dictatorship. The old<br />\nintellectual leaders of the Syndicalists, Socialists and Anarchists<br />\nhave almost all repudiated Bolshevism. They believe in constructive revolution rather than<br />\nin the Bolshevist destructive revolution. \"But,\" said Mr. Walling,<br />\n\"the intellectual leaders have been<br />\nreplaced by the bourgeoise Socialist leaders with no knowledge or<br />\nreal interest in economic realities.\" Bolshevism is not a real political party, but is a social class<br />\n-a sect-with a tribal god that<br />\ntells them to destroy all that<br />\nstands in their way.

Music<br />\nhas proved a tremendous militant<br />\nforce during the war and indispensable to our soldiers and sailors. There is a far greater need<br />\nfor music now in the reconstruction period after the war, and<br />\nleading business and professional<br />\nmen must realize that no city,<br />\nhowever progressive from a commercial standpoint, can become a<br />\ngreat metropolis unless a liberal<br />\npatronage is given to the arts.<br />\nMany smaller cities\u2014Detroit, Cincinnati, St. Louis, San Francisco<br />\n\u2014support splendid orchestras and<br />\nsend them out on annual tours, advertising their cities far and wide.<br />\n\"This is what I want to see accomplished for our symphony orchestra and then there is another<br />\nhobby in which I am deeply interested\u2014it is a desire to see an<br />\nendowed department of music at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nwith courses of study, lectures,<br />\nrecitals and concerts\u2014and accommodations for a large chorus and<br />\norchestra.\"<br />\nAfter graduating from Hopkins<br />\nin 1893, Mr. Turnbull went to<br />\nEurope to study music. While<br />\nthere he composed his first orchestral composition, and dedicated it to the amateur orchestra he<br />\nhad founded in America. In 1894<br />\nhe returned to this country and<br />\nentered the real estate business,<br />\nremaining in it ever since. During all that time he kept his interest in music and participated<br />\nin many concerts, recitals and musicals as conductor, violinist and<br />\nmanager. He also sang in male<br />\nquartets. Last spring he conducted Pershing's Band, when it<br />\nplayed his military march, \"Victory,\" at the Fifth Regiment Armory.
