Dr. Adams found<br />\na document last week in the Congressional Library, which was \"so<br />\nnew, so interesting, and so surprising,\" that he was forced to alter<br />\nthe lectures to introduce new conclusions.<br />\n\"The cotton crop of 186o,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"was the largest sent to England in many years. The market<br />\nwas glutted with the finished product, and the warehouses were filled<br />\nwith raw material, because of a<br />\ndemand for English textiles which<br />\nhad sprung up all over the world.<br />\nThe demand, however, quickly died<br />\ndown. The social and economic<br />\nsituation was unprecedented. England was stocked with a three years'<br />\nsupply of cotton, and the mills were<br />\nshut down. But the South had<br />\nhoped England could not get<br />\nalong without its cotton, and<br />\nthought the loss of the supply, due<br />\nto the Union blockade, was responsible for the Lancashire destitution.

The price of textile and<br />\nraw material would have dropped.<br />\nWhen, however, the blockade cut<br />\noff the supply, the manufacturers<br />\nwere glad, because it gave them an<br />\nopportunity to get rid of their surplus stock. Prices rose rapidly, and<br />\nthe manufacturers flourished. But<br />\nthe operators in the Lancashire district were out of work. No raw<br />\nmaterial was at hand. Over five<br />\nhundred thousand persons were at<br />\none time dependent upon charity<br />\non account of the shutting down<br />\nof the factories.<br />\n\"Yet, in this extreme destitution,<br />\nthere were no demonstrations by<br />\nthese people.

The<br />\nDean did not grow up with Johns<br />\nHopkins, as did some of his colleagues. When he came to Baltimore he had already achieved distinction as a teacher and a scholar.<br />\nA graduate of Williams College<br />\nand of Union Theological Seminary, he had spent a number of<br />\nyears in the ministry and had been<br />\na member of the faculty of Williams, where he was professor of<br />\nLatin, then professor of rhetoric,<br />\nand from 1886 to 1889, Mark Hopkins professor of intellectual and<br />\nmoral philosophy. He had received<br />\nthe degree of doctor of divinity.<br />\nfrom Amherst and that of doctor<br />\nof laws from Princeton.<br />\nCped to Johns Hopkins in 1889<br />\nto be dean of the college faculty<br />\nand professor of philosophy, Dr.<br />\nGriffin shared the burdens and perplexities of that period of financial<br />\ndistress in which the work of the<br />\nUniversity\u2014undergraduate as well<br />\nas graduate\u2014had to be carried on<br />\nwith very seriously diminished<br />\nrevenues. How large an interest<br />\nthe Dean has had in events that<br />\nhave influenced the destiny of the<br />\nUniversity may be understood<br />\nwhen one remembers that during<br />\nhis twenty-five years of administrative service he has seen the opening of the medical department and<br />\nits speedy rise to first place among<br />\nthe medical schools of the country,<br />\n<br />\nthe abandonment of Clifton as a<br />\nfuture site of the University, and<br />\nthe erection of McCoy Hall, the<br />\ninauguration of President Remsen,<br />\nthe gift of Homewood, the opening of the department of engineering, and the election of President<br />\nGoodnow.<br />\nIn his course in logic, psychology<br />\nand ethics, officially Philosophy I,<br />\nbut in fact rarely spoken of except as \"the Dean's course,\" Dean<br />\nGriffin has taught and personally<br />\nknown more than a thousand Hopkins students. It is in this course\u2014<br />\na fortunate survival of an earlier<br />\nday in collegiate instruction\u2014that<br />\nthe advantage of being in a relatively small college comes home<br />\nto a man. Here the seniors come<br />\ntogether from the specialization of<br />\nlaboratories and electives to study<br />\nas one class the larger issues of<br />\nlife and thought. They are as yet<br />\nfew enough in number to become<br />\nwell acquainted with each other,<br />\nand, what is more important, they<br />\nare able to come into personal relations with the official head of the<br />\ncollege. In this personal contact<br />\nwith the seniors and in the impression upon them of his quiet dignity<br />\nand broad culture lies the secret<br />\nof the affection with which the collegiate alumni of a quarter of a<br />\ncentury regard Dean Griffin.<br />\n\"Tech\" Report Is of General Interest.<br />\nThe report of progress on the<br />\n\"Tech\" buildings printed in book<br />\nform and sent by the trustees of<br />\nthe University to every member of<br />\nthe General Assembly of Maryland, was a comprehensive budget<br />\nof facts of really general interest.<br />\nUntil the report was published,<br />\nmembers of the Legislature were<br />\ndependent upon the press for information, but this source, obviously,<br />\nwas not wholly accurate nor ample.<br />\nActual students in the \"Tech\"<br />\ndepartment, too, have relied upon<br />\nthe papers for the same information. It seems that there has not<br />\nbeen an extensive authoritative announcement on the part of the University to these men. They confess that they are woefully ignorant<br />\nof,Homewood plans and progress.<br />\nWhy not send a copy of the<br />\nGeneral Assembly report to each<br />\nof the \"Tech\" students too? The<br />\nbook would be of unusual interest<br />\nto them.<br />\nThe Music at the Junior Banquet.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER last week inadvertently printed as part of the<br />\njunior banquet story the program<br />\nof music which was in reality a<br />\nfeature of the Commemoration Day<br />\nexercises. The impression was<br />\nconveyed that Edwin L.

The<br />\nDean did not grow up with Johns<br />\nHopkins, as did some of his colleagues. When he came to Baltimore he had already achieved distinction as a teacher and a scholar.<br />\nA graduate of Williams College<br />\nand of Union Theological Seminary, he had spent a number of<br />\nyears in the ministry and had been<br />\na member of the faculty of Williams, where he was professor of<br />\nLatin, then professor of rhetoric,<br />\nand from 1886 to 1889, Mark Hopkins professor of intellectual and<br />\nmoral philosophy. He had received<br />\nthe degree of doctor of divinity.<br />\nfrom Amherst and that of doctor<br />\nof laws from Princeton.<br />\nCped to Johns Hopkins in 1889<br />\nto be dean of the college faculty<br />\nand professor of philosophy, Dr.<br />\nGriffin shared the burdens and perplexities of that period of financial<br />\ndistress in which the work of the<br />\nUniversity\u2014undergraduate as well<br />\nas graduate\u2014had to be carried on<br />\nwith very seriously diminished<br />\nrevenues. How large an interest<br />\nthe Dean has had in events that<br />\nhave influenced the destiny of the<br />\nUniversity may be understood<br />\nwhen one remembers that during<br />\nhis twenty-five years of administrative service he has seen the opening of the medical department and<br />\nits speedy rise to first place among<br />\nthe medical schools of the country,<br /><br />\nthe abandonment of Clifton as a<br />\nfuture site of the University, and<br />\nthe erection of McCoy Hall, the<br />\ninauguration of President Remsen,<br />\nthe gift of Homewood, the opening of the department of engineering, and the election of President<br />\nGoodnow.<br />\nIn his course in logic, psychology<br />\nand ethics, officially Philosophy I,<br />\nbut in fact rarely spoken of except as \"the Dean's course,\" Dean<br />\nGriffin has taught and personally<br />\nknown more than a thousand Hopkins students. It is in this course\u2014<br />\na fortunate survival of an earlier<br />\nday in collegiate instruction\u2014that<br />\nthe advantage of being in a relatively small college comes home<br />\nto a man. Here the seniors come<br />\ntogether from the specialization of<br />\nlaboratories and electives to study<br />\nas one class the larger issues of<br />\nlife and thought. They are as yet<br />\nfew enough in number to become<br />\nwell acquainted with each other,<br />\nand, what is more important, they<br />\nare able to come into personal relations with the official head of the<br />\ncollege. In this personal contact<br />\nwith the seniors and in the impression upon them of his quiet dignity<br />\nand broad culture lies the secret<br />\nof the affection with which the collegiate alumni of a quarter of a<br />\ncentury regard Dean Griffin.<br />\n\"Tech\" Report Is of General Interest.<br />\nThe report of progress on the<br />\n\"Tech\" buildings printed in book<br />\nform and sent by the trustees of<br />\nthe University to every member of<br />\nthe General Assembly of Maryland, was a comprehensive budget<br />\nof facts of really general interest.<br />\nUntil the report was published,<br />\nmembers of the Legislature were<br />\ndependent upon the press for information, but this source, obviously,<br />\nwas not wholly accurate nor ample.<br />\nActual students in the \"Tech\"<br />\ndepartment, too, have relied upon<br />\nthe papers for the same information.
