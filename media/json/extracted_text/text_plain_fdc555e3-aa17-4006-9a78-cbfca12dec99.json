If you don't want to play the Administration's<br />\ngame, just don't show up at the polls today or tomorrow.<br />\nThis may be defeatist, but what's there to defeat? The<br />\nSC has done nothing this year except put out worthless<br />\nresolutions. Their greatest undertaking this semester was<br />\nto gain a quorum, which they finally got late in February<br />\nthen promptly lost it.<br />\nElections involve a transference of power from the<br />\nelectors to the elected. One has to have power to delegate<br />\npower. The plain fact is that undergraduates at Hopkins<br />\ndon't have any power to give away--especially to their<br />\nelected agents, the Student Council. For this reason, we<br />\nurge students to boycott the upcoming elections, and instead of voting to work for a change in University governance. The first step is the dissolution of this sham body.<br />\n<br />\nWomen Is Losers<br />\nThe Coeducation Task Force's long-range report is a<br />\ndisappointment. It shows that Hopkins is neither ready to<br />\nallow in enough women to make the campus worth entering nor willing to change its liberal arts courses to a level<br />\nworth attending.<br />\nThe task force's plan to raise women's admissions to<br />\nabout twenty-five per cent strikes us as mere tokenism.<br />\nWhy not fifty per cent? The report replies that to increase the number of women over a quarter would decrease the number of males accepted. Quite naturally....<br />\nHowever, earlier this year the task force noted that Hopkins has presently a lower-qualified male pool than if it<br />\nalso allowed girls to apply. Therefore, besides the social<br />\nadvantages of more women, Hopkins would receive moretalented applicants to choose from.<br />\nThe report also ignores the future. Instead of competing with Goucher over female students, Hopkins should<br />\nconsider a future merger with its sister school. Goucher<br />\nprovides the excellent liberal arts training Hopkins lacks.<br />\nFurthermore, it's a myth that Hopkins\u2014even if it had the<br />\nwill\u2014could build up its puny liberal arts courses with the<br />\ncurrent financial malaise that should continue for a number of years.<br />\nOn one major point, though, the Coed Task Force<br />\ndeserves credit: it refused to abide by President Gordon's<br />\n\"recommendation\" to cover the cost of admitting women<br />\nby raising class size to 600 in 1971. The addition of<br />\nseventy-five students, as the report cogently maintains,<br />\nwould make even larger classes\u2014which inevitably would<br />\nincrease student frustration and mediocre instruction.<br />\nChairman Carl Swanson termed this report \"longranged\" after it failed to appear on time in early February.<br />\nYet it is neither long-term nor comprehensive. In its<br />\nattempt to gain approval from the Academic Council, it<br />\nskirts many issues that face Hopkins and permits this<br />\ninstitution to remain narrow minded and stale\u2014even with<br />\na few added girls.<br />\n<br />\n(\\oz,<br />\nNEEr RAIN 6Er<br />\n3<br />\n.,c)sy ot4 i-r!<br />\n<br />\nWhat is the Johns Hopkins University? It is the<br />\nAdministration, Faculty, U.S.Government and the<br />\nschool workers. It is also a graduate school, where<br />\nPh.D's come to do research, and help graduate<br />\nstudents to do same. It is a school where the life<br />\nof a faculty member is dependent upon his research<br />\nand writing.<br />\nNow, when one considers this analysis and asks<br />\nthe question, \"What is an Undergraduate?,\" he<br />\nfinds an incongruence. For 'undergraduate' means<br />\nor is synonomous with 'teaching',--being taught\u2014,<br />\nand this is not a teaching institution. One has to<br />\nreally understand the position of an undergraduate<br />\nat a research-oriented, non-teaching, government<br />\naffiliated institution if he is to consider the viability<br />\nof a student government organization as a means<br />\nof representation.<br />\n<br />\n-I am an Illusion\"<br />\nTo understand this position is to understand that<br />\nI am an illusion, along w ith my office, my organization and my constitutents. To understand this is to<br />\nunderstand that I have no real power with which to<br />\nrepresent you.<br />\nIn a meeting Wednesday night, the SC voted 6-4-2<br />\nto refuse acceptance of a new Council unless it is<br />\ngiven a guarantee of a change in the relationship<br />\nbetween the Undergraduate student and the rest<br />\nof the University community. To my mind, the SC<br />\ncame of age that Wednesday night. This was your<br />\nStudent Council saying for the first time, \"I, the<br />\nundergraduate student, want to 'be.\"<br />\n<br />\nNew Era<br />\nSuch action has hopefully dated the beginning of<br />\na new era in student government at Hopkins. The<br />\nquestion the Council rightly poses to this undergraduate community is very simply stated, \"Do<br />\nwe need an SC or don't we?\" If we do, the SC is<br />\ndemanding the right to exist with equal power<br />\nalong with the rest of the University community<br />\nin order to perform its Constitutional duties.If we<br />\ndo not, then the Council is performing a service<br />\nin helping to rid this campus of unnecessary governance debris.<br />\nThe preamble of the SC constitution reads,\"We,<br />\nthe Undergraduate Students, in order to establish<br />\nunity, to promote integrity, to maintain students<br />\nand democratic government, to improve educational opportunity and to foster understanding<br />\nand fellowship do ordain and establish this Constitution.\" In other words, the SC was established<br />\nto do what today seems an impossibility for student government at Hopkins, because in none of<br />\nthese areas can the Council truthfully say it has<br />\nthe power to do anything.<br />\n<br />\nRaising Questions<br />\nThe Council can raise questions all year long,<br />\nas it has done, but in terms of real decisionmaking powers, it has none. Additionally, every<br />\nUniversity committee for which the SC selects<br />\nrepresentatives is an advisory committee,so that<br />\nthe real decisions are always out of our hands.<br />\nFor the undergraduate, University reform will<br />\nalways be a sham until there is some voice with<br />\npower in the Academic Council or equal membership in a Homewood decision-making group.<br />\nThe popularity of the News-Letter, the SA, the<br />\nMoratorium Committee,etc. is a testimony to their<br />\n<br />\n'Tow to make rain<br />\n(turn to page46)<br />\n<br />\nFt-IP<br />\nF/-1P<br />\nFLAP<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nt 0,14 rmertrtets, Itte, 11170<br />\n<br />\nyou believe that a Student Council does this for you.<br />\nThis is far from the truth.<br />\nNEVER are they allowed into the domain of Univsity governance.

All such groups may accomplish peripheral<br />\nchanges in the nature of the student body, but<br />\n<br />\nAll Doomed<br />\nUnless the relationship of the Undergraduate to<br />\nthe rest of the University community is improved,<br />\nstudents under any name, proposing to make necessary changes for the welfare of the student population, all doomed to failure because the Undergraduate has no power. The Calender Reform issue is a<br />\nmyth worth undoing. und the New University Conference does it best.\"At least two pressing issues<br />\nwere not addressed at all by the actions of the<br />\nfaculty and the Academic Council: the inaccessability of the faculty to the students, and the lack of<br />\nrepresentation of students in the decision-making<br />\nprecesses of the University.<br />\nA major reason for student support of the minisemester, in addition to those mentioned above,<br />\nwas that students hoped that they could at long last<br />\ncome into close contact with the faculty for a short<br />\nperiod of time and discuss issue,,, of their own<br />\nchoosing. It is pathetic that students requested<br />\nthat only symptomatic relief be given in the form<br />\nof the mini-semester, while they did not press for<br />\nmore basic changes in student-faculty relations at<br />\nHopkins. But it is nothing short of incredible that<br />\nthe faculty disregarded even the symptom of their<br />\nfailure...As the NUC stated,\"The real issue of the<br />\nrights of students was never confronted.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Real Issue<br />\nAnd so this SC finally decided to confront the real<br />\nissue. The Governance question was the vehicle.<br />\nAfter being refused an audience with the General<br />\nAssembly of the Faculty, because Mike Beer<br />\n\"didn't see any reason for it,\" the Council made<br />\na direct appeal to the faculty, only to be told that<br />\na lot of the faculty hesitation w as because the Council had not gone through the proper channels.<br />\nWho decides whether or not student-faculty relationships are important to the welfare of the<br />\nstudents? Not the SC,or the SC and faculty but Mike<br />\nBeer alone, and he decided that theywere not. If it<br />\nhad not been Mike Beer, it would have been someone else. If it had not been University governance it would have been another issue.<br />\n<br />\nSo what does all of this mean. It means that<br />\nyour SC has finally decided to do something. has<br />\nIt<br />\nfinally decided that the school just might<br />\nbe able to<br />\nget alongwithout having an SC for University public<br />\nrelations. Any power that we might have in getting<br />\ndone some of the things you griped<br />\nabout in the<br />\nGovernance petitions is now up to your backing<br />\nthis SC action.<br />\n<br />\nNo Student Council<br />\nThe student body should have clearly defined<br />\nmeans to participate in the formulation and application of institutional policy affecting academic<br />\nand student affairs.

PETER<br />\nBefore a crowd of over four thousand, Coach Bob Scott<br />\nand his Blue Jays staged a tremendous comeback Saturday, in a down-to-the-wire thriller against Mt. Washington at Norris Field. The Jays won 11-10.<br />\nAfter settling down, it was clear that Hopkins had it all<br />\nover the Wolfpack in capturing its first Norris Field victory since 1933, and first back-to-back wins against Mount<br />\nWashington since the 1933-1934 seasons.<br />\nHopkins, down 4-0 at the end of the first quarter, bombed Mount goalies, Ritchie Alter and Brian Poole, with 23<br />\nshots in the second quarter. Alter a discouraging first<br />\nquarter in which Hopkins missed its first 12 shots, many<br />\nof which banged off the post, sophomore Gary Handelman<br />\nled the charge which accounted for the fantastic six goal<br />\nsecond period. Overall, Hopkins outshot Mt. Washington,<br />\n57-42.<br />\n<br />\ned a tremendous scoring punch, Gary Handelsman led the<br />\noffensive show scoring two goals and displaying exceptional speed and stickhandling ability.<br />\nSharing the scoring honors with two apiece were Charlie<br />\nCoker, Doug Honig, and Stu Kahl. Also scoring for Hopkins were Doug Fuchs, Bill Donovan, and Bob Pfeifer.<br />\nEric Bergofsky played a tremendous game as well, with<br />\nthree assists and many crucial clears up his credit.<br />\n<br />\nDefense Shines as Well<br />\n<br />\nMount Outplayed<br />\n<br />\nHopkins defense, although allowing ten goals to the<br />\nMount, was still superb. Led by goalie Ken Dauses, the<br />\nBlue Jay defense, after an early surge by Mt. Washington,<br />\nput the pressure onthe Wolfpack throughout the rest of the<br />\nballgame. Starting defensemen,Paul Weiss,Rob MacCool,<br />\nand sophomore Joe Cieslowslci, provided Dauses with<br />\nample protection in the final three garters of play. Dauses, with some superb netminding,wound up with 11 saves.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins out-hustled and out-hit the Mount throughout<br />\nthe contest and never lost the 6-5 lead it enjoyed at the<br />\nhalf. The Blue Jays showed that they were capable of playing rough and tumble lacrosse and hitting with the best of<br />\nthem.<br />\nRelying on exceptionally strong midfield play, which<br />\naccounted for eight of Hopkins' eleven goals, and exhibit-<br />\n<br />\nThe Mt. Washington ballclub, reading almost like an allstar Hopkins team, put on quite a show in their own right.<br />\nHowever, the flashy play and finesse so characteristic of<br />\nMt. Washington clubs, was spotty at times. Although hampered by an overall fine defensive game on the part of Hopkins, the Wolfpack still managed to display some of their<br />\ntremendous passing game in setting up many of their goals.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' Paul Weiss,(34), defends against all-time Hopkins great, Joe Cowan,(25). Pictured in<br />\nbackground is ex-Blue Jay, Phil Buck. All were teammates here last year.<br />\n<br />\nLast year's Turnbull Award winner,Joe Cowan,who always intimidates netminders with his tremendous moves<br />\naround the goal, led the Wolfpack with three unassisted<br />\ngoals and two assists. Phil Kneip, another Hopkins \"old<br />\ntimer\", scored two goals along with Hy Levesseur. Joe<br />\nSeivold, Gene Fusting, and Hopkins' own Assistant Freshman Coach, Jerry Schnydman, each tallied once.<br />\n<br />\nThree Goal Lead<br />\nHopkins jumped to a three goal lead early in the third<br />\nquarter, to make the score 8-5, infavor of the Blue Jays.<br />\nThe third quarter ended with Hopkins on top 9-7.<br />\nFrom this point on it was all Joe Cowan, as he singlehandedly kept the Wolfpack in the ballgame with two of his<br />\nthree goals coming in the final quarter of play. After goals<br />\nby Bob Pfeifer and Stu Kahl, Hopkins led 11-9 with 1:33<br />\nleft to go in the game.<br />\nWith only 35 seconds left, Mt.Washington's Gene Fusting,<br />\non a feed from Phil Kneip, primped the ball into the goal<br />\nto make the score 11-10. The Wolfpack grabbed the next<br />\nfaceoff but lost it to Hopkins with 21 seconds left. Hopkins,<br />\nin throwing the ball upfield, lost it out of bounds, but regained possession as Joe Cowan was called for pushing<br />\nwith ten seconds remaining.The Blue Jays then ran out the<br />\nclock in what will be remembered by many fans as one of<br />\nthe greatest lacrosse thrillers ever.<br />\n<br />\nTaking the day off from his job as Asst.

Another copy has been sent to Dean<br />\nKimball.<br />\nThe resolution proposes that the park-<br /><br />\ning be opened up in the fall, with all<br />\ncars of people living more than 3/4 mile<br />\nfrom campus being issued permits.Cars<br />\nwithout permits would only be allowed<br />\nto park in the two metered lots, with a<br />\n$15.00 fine and possible towing as penalties for violation of this rule.<br />\nThe proposal also calls for the change<br />\nof Remsen Road (in front of the library)<br />\nto a one-way street,flowing north. Parking would then be permitted on the west<br />\nside of this road.<br />\nSingleton further asked that the current parking fines in excess of $25.00<br />\nbe reduced to 25% of the total, stating<br />\nthat currently \"almost any violation<br />\ncould be termed justifiable.\" The resolution also asked that Campus Police<br />\nbe instructed to ticket cars only for flagrent violations, as long as the -current<br />\nsituation exists.<br /><br />\nTo improve student life, Owens asserted that he would take all power away<br />\nfrom those who have it. He explained,<br />\nas an example, that in the freshman<br />\nclass, Colonel Serena was constantly<br />\nhindering people, and should be removed.<br />\nOwens said that he _might use some<br />\nvery extreme measures in implementing his desires. \"Levelling the University would not be out of order,\" Owens<br />\nsaid. \"It isn't worth shit.\" He added,<br />\nthough, that it also wouldn't be worth<br />\nthe hassle.<br /><br />\nTranscend Baltimore<br />\nOwens also said, \"If I were President I would like to show students how to<br />\nignore Baltimore, to transcend it. I want<br />\nnothing to do with what goes on in that<br />\ncity.\"<br /><br />\nKatz Bows Out of SC Race<br />\nWhat follows is the partial text of a<br />\nstatement prepared by Sam Katz announcing<br />\nhis withdrawal .from the SC presidential race.<br />\nI believe that Dr. Gordon is trying to<br />\nplay students against students and students against faculty and in this way is<br />\nimpeding student participation in campus decision making. For this reason, I<br />\nam resigning from the race for Student<br />\nCouncil President.<br />\nThe university, which should be the<br />\nplace for higher learning has been transformed into a mecca for traveling researchers, churning out work, some of<br />\nIt good, most of it superfluous. The<br />\noverpaying undergraduate is made to sit<br />\nIn the classroom and listen to what the<br />\nprofessor feels is important but what<br />\nthe student knows is irrelevant. The<br />\nquestion is, whose school is it?....<br /><br />\nNO Power<br />\nWe possess the Student Council as<br />\nthe voice of our political structure, but<br />\nIt has NO power. It is not respected by<br />\nthe administration, the faculty, and<br />\nworse, by the student body. Why doesn't<br />\nIt have a voice, Sipply because Dr.Gor-<br /><br />\ndon doesn't want it to. In short, student<br />\nvoices cannot be heard above administrative shouts.... I am going to try to work<br />\nthrough other channels to get student<br />\nrepresentation on the Academic Council. If we can't get it then its time for<br />\nHopkins to close its doors to undergraduates...,<br /><br />\nPetty Squabbling<br />\nI have reached the conclusion that the<br />\nStudent Council with all of its petty<br />\nsquabbling can not carry out the real<br />\nneeds of Hopkins undergrads. And while<br />\nIt may continue to sponsor symposiums<br />\nand social events, it is not a viable or<br />\neffective political body. I would suggest<br />\nthat the present Council not accept the<br />\nnew council and come upwith analternative representative body. However, I<br />\nhave no ideas on how to make the new<br />\ngroup powerful.<br />\nIn resigning I would urge all students<br />\nto consider their four years at Hopkins<br />\nand their $2500 tuition and ask themselves, \"Is there an alternative?\" I<br />\nbelieve that if one can't be found then<br />\nwe are wasting \u00b0lir time.<br />\n;.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nApril 14. 1970<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nCLASSIFIED<br />\nPERSONAL<br />\nTo my family and Cathy Moon-No matter what has happened<br />\nrecently, good or bad, I still love<br />\nYou all and always will.

Today it survives, aimless and<br />\npowerless, functioning solely as the Administration's showcase for those who like to say we have student imput here.<br />\nElecting a new Council would be participating in a<br />\ncharade. If you don't want to play the Administration's<br />\ngame, just don't show up at the polls today or tomorrow.<br />\nThis may be defeatist, but what's there to defeat? The<br />\nSC has done nothing this year except put out worthless<br />\nresolutions. Their greatest undertaking this semester was<br />\nto gain a quorum, which they finally got late in February<br />\nthen promptly lost it.<br />\nElections involve a transference of power from the<br />\nelectors to the elected. One has to have power to delegate<br />\npower. The plain fact is that undergraduates at Hopkins<br />\ndon't have any power to give away--especially to their<br />\nelected agents, the Student Council. For this reason, we<br />\nurge students to boycott the upcoming elections, and instead of voting to work for a change in University governance. The first step is the dissolution of this sham body.<br /><br />\nWomen Is Losers<br />\nThe Coeducation Task Force's long-range report is a<br />\ndisappointment. It shows that Hopkins is neither ready to<br />\nallow in enough women to make the campus worth entering nor willing to change its liberal arts courses to a level<br />\nworth attending.<br />\nThe task force's plan to raise women's admissions to<br />\nabout twenty-five per cent strikes us as mere tokenism.<br />\nWhy not fifty per cent? The report replies that to increase the number of women over a quarter would decrease the number of males accepted. Quite naturally....<br />\nHowever, earlier this year the task force noted that Hopkins has presently a lower-qualified male pool than if it<br />\nalso allowed girls to apply. Therefore, besides the social<br />\nadvantages of more women, Hopkins would receive moretalented applicants to choose from.<br />\nThe report also ignores the future. Instead of competing with Goucher over female students, Hopkins should<br />\nconsider a future merger with its sister school. Goucher<br />\nprovides the excellent liberal arts training Hopkins lacks.<br />\nFurthermore, it's a myth that Hopkins\u2014even if it had the<br />\nwill\u2014could build up its puny liberal arts courses with the<br />\ncurrent financial malaise that should continue for a number of years.<br />\nOn one major point, though, the Coed Task Force<br />\ndeserves credit: it refused to abide by President Gordon's<br />\n\"recommendation\" to cover the cost of admitting women<br />\nby raising class size to 600 in 1971. The addition of<br />\nseventy-five students, as the report cogently maintains,<br />\nwould make even larger classes\u2014which inevitably would<br />\nincrease student frustration and mediocre instruction.<br />\nChairman Carl Swanson termed this report \"longranged\" after it failed to appear on time in early February.<br />\nYet it is neither long-term nor comprehensive. In its<br />\nattempt to gain approval from the Academic Council, it<br />\nskirts many issues that face Hopkins and permits this<br />\ninstitution to remain narrow minded and stale\u2014even with<br />\na few added girls.<br /><br />\n(\\oz,<br />\nNEEr RAIN 6Er<br />\n3<br />\n.,c)sy ot4 i-r!<br /><br />\nWhat is the Johns Hopkins University? It is the<br />\nAdministration, Faculty, U.S.Government and the<br />\nschool workers. It is also a graduate school, where<br />\nPh.D's come to do research, and help graduate<br />\nstudents to do same. It is a school where the life<br />\nof a faculty member is dependent upon his research<br />\nand writing.<br />\nNow, when one considers this analysis and asks<br />\nthe question, \"What is an Undergraduate?,\" he<br />\nfinds an incongruence. For 'undergraduate' means<br />\nor is synonomous with 'teaching',--being taught\u2014,<br />\nand this is not a teaching institution. One has to<br />\nreally understand the position of an undergraduate<br />\nat a research-oriented, non-teaching, government<br />\naffiliated institution if he is to consider the viability<br />\nof a student government organization as a means<br />\nof representation.<br /><br />\n-I am an Illusion\"<br />\nTo understand this position is to understand that<br />\nI am an illusion, along w ith my office, my organization and my constitutents. To understand this is to<br />\nunderstand that I have no real power with which to<br />\nrepresent you.<br />\nIn a meeting Wednesday night, the SC voted 6-4-2<br />\nto refuse acceptance of a new Council unless it is<br />\ngiven a guarantee of a change in the relationship<br />\nbetween the Undergraduate student and the rest<br />\nof the University community. To my mind, the SC<br />\ncame of age that Wednesday night. This was your<br />\nStudent Council saying for the first time, \"I, the<br />\nundergraduate student, want to 'be.\"<br /><br />\nNew Era<br />\nSuch action has hopefully dated the beginning of<br />\na new era in student government at Hopkins. The<br />\nquestion the Council rightly poses to this undergraduate community is very simply stated, \"Do<br />\nwe need an SC or don't we?\" If we do, the SC is<br />\ndemanding the right to exist with equal power<br />\nalong with the rest of the University community<br />\nin order to perform its Constitutional duties.If we<br />\ndo not, then the Council is performing a service<br />\nin helping to rid this campus of unnecessary governance debris.<br />\nThe preamble of the SC constitution reads,\"We,<br />\nthe Undergraduate Students, in order to establish<br />\nunity, to promote integrity, to maintain students<br />\nand democratic government, to improve educational opportunity and to foster understanding<br />\nand fellowship do ordain and establish this Constitution.\" In other words, the SC was established<br />\nto do what today seems an impossibility for student government at Hopkins, because in none of<br />\nthese areas can the Council truthfully say it has<br />\nthe power to do anything.<br /><br />\nRaising Questions<br />\nThe Council can raise questions all year long,<br />\nas it has done, but in terms of real decisionmaking powers, it has none. Additionally, every<br />\nUniversity committee for which the SC selects<br />\nrepresentatives is an advisory committee,so that<br />\nthe real decisions are always out of our hands.<br />\nFor the undergraduate, University reform will<br />\nalways be a sham until there is some voice with<br />\npower in the Academic Council or equal membership in a Homewood decision-making group.<br />\nThe popularity of the News-Letter, the SA, the<br />\nMoratorium Committee,etc. is a testimony to their<br /><br />\n'Tow to make rain<br />\n(turn to page46)<br /><br />\nFt-IP<br />\nF/-1P<br />\nFLAP<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nt 0,14 rmertrtets, Itte, 11170<br /><br />\nyou believe that a Student Council does this for you.<br />\nThis is far from the truth.<br />\nNEVER are they allowed into the domain of Univsity governance.

The Calender Reform issue is a<br />\nmyth worth undoing. und the New University Conference does it best.\"At least two pressing issues<br />\nwere not addressed at all by the actions of the<br />\nfaculty and the Academic Council: the inaccessability of the faculty to the students, and the lack of<br />\nrepresentation of students in the decision-making<br />\nprecesses of the University.<br />\nA major reason for student support of the minisemester, in addition to those mentioned above,<br />\nwas that students hoped that they could at long last<br />\ncome into close contact with the faculty for a short<br />\nperiod of time and discuss issue,,, of their own<br />\nchoosing. It is pathetic that students requested<br />\nthat only symptomatic relief be given in the form<br />\nof the mini-semester, while they did not press for<br />\nmore basic changes in student-faculty relations at<br />\nHopkins. But it is nothing short of incredible that<br />\nthe faculty disregarded even the symptom of their<br />\nfailure...As the NUC stated,\"The real issue of the<br />\nrights of students was never confronted.\"<br /><br />\nThe Real Issue<br />\nAnd so this SC finally decided to confront the real<br />\nissue. The Governance question was the vehicle.<br />\nAfter being refused an audience with the General<br />\nAssembly of the Faculty, because Mike Beer<br />\n\"didn't see any reason for it,\" the Council made<br />\na direct appeal to the faculty, only to be told that<br />\na lot of the faculty hesitation w as because the Council had not gone through the proper channels.<br />\nWho decides whether or not student-faculty relationships are important to the welfare of the<br />\nstudents? Not the SC,or the SC and faculty but Mike<br />\nBeer alone, and he decided that theywere not. If it<br />\nhad not been Mike Beer, it would have been someone else. If it had not been University governance it would have been another issue.<br /><br />\nSo what does all of this mean. It means that<br />\nyour SC has finally decided to do something. has<br />\nIt<br />\nfinally decided that the school just might<br />\nbe able to<br />\nget alongwithout having an SC for University public<br />\nrelations. Any power that we might have in getting<br />\ndone some of the things you griped<br />\nabout in the<br />\nGovernance petitions is now up to your backing<br />\nthis SC action.<br /><br />\nNo Student Council<br />\nThe student body should have clearly defined<br />\nmeans to participate in the formulation and application of institutional policy affecting academic<br />\nand student affairs. The role of the SC and both<br />\nits general and specific responsibilities should<br />\nbe made explicit. Otherwise, University governance will be the same thing all over again. But this<br />\ntime I hope it will not be with a Student Council.<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nApril 14, 1970<br /><br />\nfeatures<br />\nJohn Barth, Demon Novelist, Zaps Us All<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nA magician and a clown and a juggler<br />\ncame to Goucher last Thursday night.<br />\nHis name was John Barth, a novelist.<br />\nThe Kraushaar auditorium was packed<br />\nwith students and professors who were<br />\nstunned, awed, bewildered, and amused<br />\nby the sheer power of Barth's storytelling.
