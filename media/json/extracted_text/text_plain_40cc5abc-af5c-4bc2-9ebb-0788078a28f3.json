McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: to sleep,<br />\nperchance to dream for just a few<br />\nmore minutes, honest, I swear,<br />\njust let me lie here . . . .<br />\nHere's the thing. Anyone with<br />\na foolproof guar-ron-teed absolutely surefire no-doubt-aboutit way to get up in the morning<br />\nthe minute you need to, raise your<br />\nhand.<br />\nI thought so.<br />\nIt can't be done. Impossible.<br />\nAn integral step in the evolutionary cycle that brought us up<br />\nfrom the basic primeval sludge of<br />\nthe earth into the highly advanced sludge of humanity that we are<br />\ntoday involved a snipping of those<br />\nsegments of DNA that control our<br />\nmetabolic rhythms and our ability to make it on time to 8:00<br />\nclasses. All that talk you hear<br />\nabout \"biological clocks\" on<br />\ncable health networks and in triathlete magazines is a load of<br />\nmonkey liver that was invented to<br />\nmakes us feel better about our own<br />\nshortcomings and to explain the<br />\nexistence of certain freaks who<br />\nnot only get up on time, but also<br />\nhave complete mental control<br />\nover that \"sleep-mousse\" that<br />\nmanages to turn one's hair into<br />\none of the bush-sculptures at Walt<br />\nDisney World.<br />\nWhat's this? Protest from those<br />\nneatly-groomed peppy freaks?<br />\nEveryone has a biological clock?<br />\nNobody really has a problem getting up'?<br />\nYour honor, Exhibit A. The<br />\nSnooze Alarm.<br />\nI've lived with one of my two<br />\npresent roommates now for three<br />\nyears. During two of those years<br />\n(almost), we were on crew<br />\ntogether. Part of crew training requires that those participants get<br />\nup for morning workout the night<br />\nbefore.<br />\nIn any event. This particular<br />\nroommate of mine is what we call<br />\na \"heavy sleeper,\" which really<br />\nmeans that he requires a<br />\ndefibrillator to regain consciousness every morning. Accordingly, he has an alarm clock<br />\nthat is Armageddon itself. It's<br />\nyour standard radio-alarm issue,<br />\n<br />\ncirca 1975 or so, with flipswitches instead of touchsensitive buttons. Ah, but then,<br />\nit's not standard, it's magic, for<br />\nthis unassuming clock can instantly transform any Debby Boone<br />\nsong into an air raid over Guam.<br />\nWhen this mechanical bird of<br />\nhappiness explodes into song<br />\nevery morning, my roommate<br />\nquickly shuts it off, the moment<br />\nthat the plaster in the ceiling<br />\nbecomes cracked enough to send<br />\na small piece raining onto his<br />\nforehead. However, having lived with this device for most of his<br />\nlife, he is able to make this move<br />\ninstinctively, even in his deepest<br />\nComas.<br />\nIn an effort to drag himself out<br />\nof bed, then, he found it<br />\nnecessary to place the alarm clock<br />\nat the foot of, and a few feet<br />\nbelow, the foot of his bed. This<br />\nway, not only would he be forced to get out of bed, but he would<br />\nallow enough time for two or<br />\nthree thousand fillings in the<br />\nGreater Baltimore area to be<br />\nloosened while the alarm went<br />\noff. But this arrangement was not<br />\nacceptable either, he soon noted,<br />\nfor this actually required him to<br />\nget out of bed in order to hit the<br />\nSnooze Alarm.<br />\nFor those of you not already<br />\nfamiliar with it, the Snooze<br />\nAlarm is a bit of mechanical<br />\ngenius that allows one to interrupt<br />\nany alarm, as it is going off, for<br />\nabout seven to nine minutes. This<br />\nallows one to sneak in an EXTRA<br />\nFIVE MINUTES OF SLEEP<br />\neach morning!! FIVE WHOLE<br />\nMINUTES!! Oh boy! Wow!<br />\nThink of the restful slumber<br />\nyou'd miss otherwise! Thank God<br />\nfor the immeasureable wonderfulness of technology.<br />\nIn order to prevent an addiction<br />\nto Snooze Alarms similar to that<br />\ncreated by biofeedback machines,<br />\nmost clocks have a default built<br />\ninto them which limits the snooze<br />\nalarm to an effectiveness of<br />\ntwenty-five or thirty presses. Increased usage of the Snooze<br />\nSee PUNCH, 7<br />\n<br />\nBush: Less than humane<br />\nWhile President George Bush and Hopkins dignitaries participated in Commemoration Day exercises in Shriver Hall,<br />\nseveral Hopkins-affiliated groups gathered in protest, in the<br />\nrain, on the steps of Levering Hall. Students and other members<br />\nof the Homewood community, including such diverse groups<br />\nas the Women's Center, Students for Environmental Action,<br />\nthe Progressive Student Union and the School of Public Health,<br />\nrallied against the University's decision to select President Bush<br />\nas the speaker for the Commemoration Day theme: \"Doctoring in America.\"<br />\nDuring the ceremony Bush received an honorary Doctor of<br />\nHumane Letters degree. Unfortunately, the Bush Adminstration's actions toward public health have been less than humane.<br />\nIn this fiscal year alone, the Administration proposes to cut<br />\nfederal public health expenditures by 7 percent. The Administration has already limited Medicaid funding for abortions,<br />\nand deeply cut funding for family planning centers and contraceptive research.<br />\n<br />\nWith the importance that Bush claims to place on the notion<br />\nof family and American values, how is it that 500,000 women<br />\neach year give birth to children without medical care and that<br />\n42 percent of families headed by single women live beneath<br />\nthe poverty line? A consequence of this poverty is that 40,000<br />\ninfants die in their first year; one-half of these deaths can be<br />\nprevented with increased access to prenatal and maternal health<br />\ncare<br />\nThese facts and figures should be kept in mind when Bush<br />\nspeaks of his Administration's commitment to health care. He<br />\nrefers to Secretary Sullivan's evaluation of cost, quality,and<br />\neffectiveness of care, and of a program to study overall treatment. Such kind and gentle rhetoric is nice enough when looking down from the House on the hill, but an active public health<br />\npolicy is long overdue. Surely a more appropriate Commemoration speaker than President Bush could have been found to<br />\ndiscuss \"Doctoring in America.\"<br />\n<br />\nA new mission for Johns Hopkins<br />\nWhile President Muller has done a great deal for the Johns<br />\nHopkins University as a whole over the past twenty years, the<br />\nundergraduate division has not received as much attention as<br />\nit deserves. While the School of Arts and Sciences still offers<br />\na combination of small classes and a truly worldly faculty that<br />\nfew schools can match, current budgetary problems have shaken<br />\nstudent confidence in the University's commitment to its<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nOur next president must respond to this unease not with<br />\ndollars alone, but with a revolutionary approach to<br />\nundergraduate education: It is time to reinstitute the core curriculum and, in the liberal arts, the mandatory senior thesis.<br />\nThese must be part of a three-pronged philosophy which will<br />\ndecisively set a Hopkins undergraduate education apart from<br />\nall other universities.<br />\nFirst, our liberal arts must be kept from falling into the abyss<br />\nof grade inflation which scars so many other schools; an 'A'<br />\nshould be a rare occurrence. One step towards arresting the slide<br />\ntowards grade inflation (still far more controlled here than at<br />\nYale or Stanford\u2014average grades at those schools are said to<br />\nbe nearly 3.8) is to reintroduce the mandatory senior thesis,<br />\na victim of the turbulent 1960's. It is ludicrous that English,<br />\nWriting Seminars, and Political Science majors, for example,<br />\nare not required to submit a supervised thesis in order to<br />\ngraduate. A thesis is an invaluable learning experience, and<br />\nwould allow professors and future employers/graduate schools<br />\nto see if students had gotten anything out of four expensive<br />\nyears. It would also put Hopkins on the academic map as a<br />\nschool which was extremely serious about substantive<br />\n<br />\nundergraduate liberal arts education.<br />\nSecond, all students, whether in the sciences or in the<br />\nhumanities, should begin with a common core curriculum.<br />\nTwenty-five years ago, all Hopkins students had to take two<br />\nterms of Occidental Civilization. This should be reinstated, in<br />\nconjunction with courses which reflect the globalization of late<br />\ntwentieth-century life. Liberal arts students must also be required to take some hard sciences. The idea that such students<br />\ndon't need a strong quantitative background is absurd and hardly befits an institution with Hopkins' ancestry.<br />\nThird, the University must keep class sizes down. The difficulty some professors are already having with hordes of<br />\nstudents begging for their seminars is alarming. Either the<br />\nUniversity must expand its course offerings, or accept fewer<br />\nstudents. There are plenty of professors who do not teach much,<br />\nif at all. And there are plenty of other schools where sharp<br />\nundergraduates can go if they receive inadequate instruction<br />\nhere. Worst of all, large classes are a betrayal of Hopkins'<br />\ngreatest claim to fame: academic intimacy.<br />\nA well-conceived philosophy of what an undergraduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins should be would help to restore confidence<br />\nin the Arts and Sciences, and would lend greater meaning to<br />\nwhat is often an unpleasant grind. The promotion of a core curriculum and the return of such challenges as the senior thesis,<br />\nwould restore the lustre which is often missing from liberal<br />\narts degrees, and broaden the minds of sometimes myopic scientists. Most of all, a clear philosophy, based on this University's unique and proud past, would give the Arts and Sciences<br />\na sense of direction and meaning.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nSpectator I<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to preface this letter to the editor with a brief statement: relax. I'm not attacking<br />\nanyone; I'm merely addressing<br />\nthe Homewood campus about an<br />\nissue that I think has gained in<br />\nprominence this year. That issue<br />\nis the unprecedented fever of action that has been spreading<br />\nthrough the special interest<br />\ngroups across campus. A fever of<br />\naction is not in and of itself a bad<br />\nthing. The Students for Environmental Action organization<br />\nhas quietly set up special garbage<br />\ncans across campus for glass and<br />\n<br />\naluminum waste and their project, because of the support of<br />\nstudents, has been an overwhelming success, and hundreds of<br />\npounds of aluminum are accumulated every week. This is<br />\nmodel action. They worked hard,<br />\ndid their thing, and stepped on<br />\nnobody's toes.<br />\nstudent<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\norganizations cannot always work<br />\nthat way. Organizations will get<br />\ntheir toes stepped on, and they<br />\nhave a right to react. I want to address those organizations who<br />\nhave reacted or are considering<br />\nreactions to what they believe<br />\nwere slaps in the face. I appeal<br />\nto your good judgement when I<br />\ntell you that when I use particular<br />\nexamples I am not picking on you<br />\nand am merely using convenient<br />\nexamples.<br />\nFirst, and above all, be objective. Were you really slapped'? To<br />\nuse an overworked example, I appeal to the case of James Rosen.<br />\nThe cartoon that inspired the fervor was not racist. It dealt with<br />\nthe white liberal establishment on<br />\ncampus. Certainly, it could have<br />\nbeen misconstrued as racist, and<br />\nI suspect that the News-Letter<br />\neditors knew that it was not racist<br />\nitself hut would be read as such,<br />\nand that is why they chose not to<br />\nprint it. I believe that most people who have seen it, though,<br />\n<br />\nwould agree that it was not racist.<br />\nif! have inadvertently stepped on<br />\nsomeone's toes with this remark,<br />\nI'm not sorry, because it was just<br />\nan example to make a point.<br />\nThink about that betbre you write<br />\nin your letters. Think about<br />\nwhether or not I've really hurt<br />\nyou.<br />\nSecondly, I want people to consider how strongly and to whom<br />\nto react. I don't mean to pick, but<br />\nonce again I need an example,<br />\nand the latest available is the<br />\nWomen's Center reaction to the<br />\ninfamous \"2x +I\" strip that appeared in the Spectator. First,<br />\nconsider how strong the reaction<br />\nshould be. Ladies of the<br />\nWomen's Center, the boy was<br />\nkidding. I agree that it was in bad<br />\ntaste; I agree a response was in<br />\norder. But there are limits. Instead of going to the administration and the entire student body<br />\nwith aggressive, shocking flyers,<br />\nmaybe a letter to the editors of the<br />\nSpectator was in order. They are,<br />\nafter all, devoted to the freedom<br />\nof speech. They would most likely print it. Once again I feel the<br />\nneed to remind you that I am not<br />\npicking on you. I am using the example of the \"2x +1\" cartoon<br />\nsimply because it suits my purposes. So, my second point: think<br />\nabout how strong your reaction<br />\nought to be, and to whom it<br />\nshould be directed.<br />\nI am not asking anyone to turn<br />\nthe other cheek. I think strong attacks deserve strong reprisals.<br />\nHowever, I feel stronger that you<br />\nhad better think hard before you<br />\ndrag a more or less innocent student or student group to the administration. Crucifixions went<br />\nout with the Romans. So I close<br />\nwith the same brief statement that<br />\nI started with: relax.<br />\nBenjamin Harris<br />\n<br />\nSpectator II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a long-time observer of the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins scene, I am at once<br />\namused\u2014and outraged\u2014that the<br />\nsame institution which condones<br />\nabortion ads, the showing of<br />\nporntlicks, and student takeovers<br />\nof administration buildings in the<br />\nname of \"free speech\" is now attempting to stifle that same<br />\nfreedom by censoring\u2014of all<br />\nthings\u2014cartoons! What Rosen,<br />\nPodurgiel et al. have run up<br />\nagainst is, of course, the radic-lib<br />\nmindset now finding its last<br />\nrefuge in the liberal media and the<br />\ntrendy groves of academia, to<br />\nwit: any point of view will be<br />\ntolerated as long as it does not<br />\noppose radic-lib political dogma.<br />\nFor too long these thougntcontrol fascists have cowed the<br />\nother 95 percent of the campus by<br />\n,loudly labelling any who disagree<br />\nas \"racist\" or \"sexist\". The<br />\nliberal mind (an oxymoron) is<br />\nnotoriously illiberal when it<br />\ncomes to entertaining opposing<br />\nviews, as we all know\u2014which is<br />\nwhy it always has to rely on censorship and fear to maintain its<br />\ngrip. Reasoned discourse, in<br />\nwhich each side is given an equal<br />\nshot,just does not compute: maddened with abstraction and smugly swollen with monumental arrogance, the radic-lib intellectualoid contemptuously dismisses<br />\nall opposition\u2014that's you\u2014out of<br />\nhand. It's really great to see the<br />\nsleeping majority wake up and<br />\nfinally acquire enough guts to<br />\nsay: look, since when have you<br />\nclowns received a private revelation from God that yours is the<br />\nonly opinion to be tolerated'?<br />\nSince Rosen's cartoon has been<br />\ncensored by the very people who<br />\nso piously bleat about the public's<br />\n\"right to know\". you and I cannot make up our own minds about<br />\nit\u2014our friendly thought control<br />\npolice have already done that for<br />\nus very nicely, thank you. But,<br />\nhaving seen Podurgiel's bid for<br />\ncartoon immortality, I have to<br />\nask: just what the hell is all the<br />\nracket about'? Are Die PolizeiSchwestern trying to feed us the<br />\n<br />\nlaughable notion that women<br />\ndon't size up men in their own<br />\nway? (The word \"hunk\"<br />\nresonates somehow in the<br />\nmemory. . .) Or are they just<br />\ndemanding that women alone<br />\nhave the right to do so? Can they<br />\ns<br />\nbe still trying to peddle the quaint<br />\ntheory, now throughly discredited<br />\nin study after study, that there is<br />\nno difference beyond the physical<br />\nbetween the sexes, 'and that<br />\nequality should mean sameness'?<br />\nOr is it that they are just<br />\npathetically out of touch with the<br />\nreal worla?<br />\nDick Oles '68<br />\n<br />\nMr. 0/es is the varsity fencing<br />\ncoach at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nEnvironmental Action<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to commend the<br />\nfirst rate operations of the<br />\nStudents for Environmental Action organization. A few short<br />\nmonths ago, it was hard to believe<br />\nthat they were a fledgling student<br />\ngroup. They have transformed<br />\nour campus into a more environmentally conscious community. In retrospect, it is difficult to imagine how the people<br />\nat Hopkins, who should be at the<br />\nforefront of the environmental<br />\nissue, could be so unaware of the<br />\nramifications of our actions. They<br />\nhave actively pursued their mission with the tenacity appropriate<br />\nfor their cause. Without<br />\npreaching or resorting to typically<br />\nimmature and radical acts (they<br />\ncould have done the asinine and<br />\ndump a load of trash landfill in<br />\nthe main office of Seiler's), they<br />\nhave made us realize the gross<br />\nhypocrisy of our deeds as well as<br />\nprove that students are capable of<br />\nrational and professional level<br />\nbehavior and organization.<br />\nI know how hard it is to<br />\nmobilize a group.

With<br />\nthe ascension of television as our<br />\nmain brm of public discourse,<br />\nAmericans have come to expect<br />\nthat even the most serious topics<br />\nbe broaght to them in an exciting<br />\nvisual manner. Nowhere is this<br />\nmore evident than a typical<br />\nbroadcast of network news. The<br />\nmusical theme, attractive<br />\ngraphcs, and handsome anchornen offer a smooth transition<br />\nfrom television's normal programining. While the viewer is<br />\nexpected to distinguish between<br />\nsitcoms and public information,<br />\nthe harmat of network news<br />\nmakes this a difficult process. As<br />\nRobert MacNeil of the MacNeilLehrer News Hour has suggested, the assumptions controlling a news program are \"that<br />\nbite-sized is best, that complexity must be avoided, that nuances<br />\nare dispensable, that qualifications impede the simple message,<br />\nthat visual stimulation is a<br />\nsubstitu:e for thought, and that<br />\nis an<br />\nverbal precision<br />\nanachronism.\" This condemnation o television news may<br />\ndistress the daily viewer, but it<br />\nshould not come as a surprise.<br />\nEntertainment is the business of<br />\ntelevision and news programs are<br />\nno exception.<br />\nTelevision news is never<br />\npresented in context. It would<br />\ntake most of the evening to explain the intricacies in the British<br />\nGovernment every time a decision by Prime Minister Thatcher<br />\nwas anncunced. Without this<br />\ninformation,<br />\nbackgrotmd<br />\nhowever, the decision becomes<br />\njust another fact in a series of<br />\nfragmen:s presented by the<br />\nnewscas:er. Incredibly, most<br />\nAmericans cannot recall a single<br />\nitem of news just a few minutes<br />\nafter watching a news program.<br />\nThis is he direct result of television's eniphasis on entertainment.<br />\nThe viewer's ability to mentally<br />\naddress each topic is curtailed by<br />\na rapid succession of visual images accompanied by unsubstantive commentary. There is no<br />\ntime for rational thought. The<br />\nviewer is set adrift in a sea of<br />\ntrivia and told to fend for himself.<br />\nTelevision news must accomplish the dual goals of relaying information in an entertaining and rapid manner. The<br />\naverage length of each shot on a<br />\nnetwork sitcom is 3.5 seconds.<br />\nOn a typical edition of the evening news, it is approximately two<br />\nseconds. One can hardly keep up<br />\n<br />\nwith the overwhelming visual<br />\ndisplay and still distinguish what<br />\nis important. A story on Mikhail<br />\nGorbachev's speech in West Germany might be accompanied by<br />\nimages of people cheering in the<br />\nstreets, opinion polls, and the<br />\nWhite House, all of which have<br />\nonly a tenuous relationship to the<br />\ncontent of the presentation. The<br />\nstory is then followed by a<br />\nMcDonald's commercial, which<br />\nis accompanied by images of people cheering in the streets, opinion polls, and the White House,<br />\nall of which have only a tenuous<br />\nrelationship to the product being<br />\nmarketed. The juxtaposition<br />\nseems clear.<br />\nThe real problem with television news is that it is on television. It might help to draw a comparison. Though the smoke signal<br />\nwas once a popular form of communication, it is safe to assume<br />\nthat Indians did not discuss the<br />\nmeaning of life through this<br />\nmedium. Muchawapeh would<br />\nhave run out of wood before he<br />\nwas able to convey his first<br />\nphilosophic axiom to the<br />\nneighboring tribe. The form<br />\ndenied the content. Television<br />\nnews is faced with a similar<br />\ndilemma. With its emphasis on<br />\nvisual imagery, television works<br />\nagainst the presentation of ideas.<br />\nImages supersede the content of<br />\nany verbal message. It would be<br />\ndifficult to concentrate on the<br />\nnews if the anchormen came on<br />\nwithout his clothes. His appearance would mitigate his ability to present information. Less<br />\noutlandish images produce the<br />\nsame effect. The form of television serves as a barrier to effective communication except on a<br />\nbasic, emotional level.<br />\nNeil Postman has suggested<br />\nthat \"The problem with television<br />\nis not that it presents us with<br />\nentertaining subject matter, but<br />\nthat it presents all subject matter<br />\nas entertaining.\" Nowhere is this<br />\nmore evident than in the format<br />\nof television news. Producers are<br />\nconfined by a medium that does<br />\nnot allow for the same rational<br />\npresentation of ideas as does the<br />\nwritten word. One would not<br />\npause in a book for a commercial<br />\nbreak. When television attempts<br />\nto present serious discourse it is<br />\nsimply doing its viewers a disservice. In its own way television is<br />\nas limited as the smoke signal.<br />\nOnly when we realize this can we<br />\nunderstand that the line between<br />\nknowledge and ignorance is easily blurred.<br />\n<br />\nMEM%<br />\n<br />\nNext GRO Meeting: 7 March,<br />\n5:30 p.m.\u2014probably in Conference Room A.<br />\nERRATUM<br />\nIn last week's GRO News(16<br />\nFeb.), we made an error concerning the report on the GRO's<br />\nmeeting with delegates from the<br />\nWomen's Center. We stated that<br />\nMs. Karen Weber was one of the<br />\ndelegates, and that she had stated<br />\nthat GRO-funded \"publications<br />\nshould interest the broad base of<br />\nthe Hopkins community.\" In<br />\nfact, Ms. Weber is not a member<br />\nof the Women's Center and was<br />\nat the meeting simply out of personal interest. Also, the quote attributed to her is incorrect.

It is irresponsible to fail to double-check facts.<br />\nMy apologies to the Women's<br />\nCenter. I made the unfortunate<br />\nmistake of assuming that those<br />\nwomen with whom I spoke were,<br />\nas a few claimed, affiliated with<br />\nthe Women's Center. Further, I<br />\ndid not mean to suggest that the<br />\nWomen's Center had demanded<br />\ncensorship. Censorship was a demand made by a few individuals<br />\nwho represented only themselves,<br />\nnot the Center.<br />\nI would like also, however to<br />\nclarify my position, as it seems<br />\nI failed to make Ms. King understand some of the points in my article. This is a clarification, not<br />\na retraction, and I hope to dispel<br />\nMs. King's criticisms of my<br />\narticle.<br />\nMs. King cites my claim that<br />\nMr. Podurgiel meant no harm as<br />\na defense of his \"primary intention\" to offend. She goes on to<br />\nsuggest that in \"shifting blame\"<br />\nto the Spectator, I do not hold<br />\nindividual contributors responsible for their words. If Ms. King,<br />\nrecalls, I did not defend any intention to offend; I suggested that<br />\nperhaps his intention was to expose: I did not suggest in fact that<br />\nhe did want to expose. I merely<br />\nsuggested that the cartoon can be<br />\ninterpreted differently than it has<br />\nbeen, a distinction so crucial to<br />\nand analysis of<br />\nthe criticisms<br />\njournalistic means and messages.<br />\nPerhaps he meant to offend;<br />\nperhaps he did not. Further, if<br />\nMs. King read my article carefully, she would have seen that I did<br />\nin fact hold Mr. Podurgiel, as a<br />\ncontributor, responsible. I explicitly demanded that he fulfill<br />\nhis obligations as a student and a<br />\ncartoonist by responding to questions directed at the \"all hate<br />\nmail\" tag which appeared at the<br />\ncartoon.<br />\nhis<br />\nof<br />\nend<br />\nMs. King's second criticism\u2014<br />\nthat 1 in fact supported the pulling of funds from the Spectator\u2014<br />\nis valid, and well-heeded; I failed to make clear my position con-<br />\n<br />\ncerning the Spectator, and<br />\nwould like this opportunity to do<br />\nso. I do not support pulling funds<br />\nfrom any publication, unless a<br />\ncompeting publication is refused<br />\nfunding. I support active and<br />\nvocal publications. I am resistant<br />\nto the stifling of journalistic<br />\nendeavors, no matter how irresponsible those endeavors may<br />\nbe. My suggestion to pull funding<br />\nwas merely to expose options<br />\nother than censorship. I realize<br />\nthat because the Spectator is independently financed (thank you<br />\nfor pointing that out to me), that<br />\nit is difficult to demand from that<br />\nsame organization to fund a rival<br />\npublication. Obviously, pulling<br />\nfunds is only a fair demand when<br />\na theoretically non-partisan group<br />\ndesigned to represent all students<br />\n(i.e., SAC) denies funding to a<br />\nrival. Further, I am not faulting<br />\nthe Spectator with the publication of the cartoon (it seems to me<br />\na journalistic duty). Rather, I fault<br />\nthem with their failure to provide<br />\nearlier a forum for discussion and<br />\nearlier<br />\nfor failure to address<br />\nan issue that they deem adequately dealt with in a cartoon.<br />\nFinally, Ms. King criticizes my<br />\ndemand that all special-interest<br />\ngroups be vocal to all divisive<br />\nissues. What this entails is not the<br />\ntime and energy she cites as<br />\ncrucial to the fulfilment of a<br />\ngroup's goals. Special interest<br />\ngroups should concentrate their<br />\nefforts on that for which they<br />\nbecame a group; it does not,<br />\nhowever, require infinite time<br />\nand energy for a special-interest<br />\ngroup to put out a press release\u2014<br />\na one-paragraph statement\u2014<br />\nconcerning their position on a<br />\ndivisive issue. Silence is a<br />\npolitical statement. All responsible organizations are attuned to<br />\nthe activities of and issues facing<br />\nothers. Because the BSU, JSA,<br />\nthe Women's Center, and other<br />\ngroups are fighting for a larger<br />\nsocial goal\u2014the right to<br />\nautonomy, equal opportunity, and<br />\nacceptance\u2014they should aid each<br />\nother, which only requires a word<br />\nof moral support.<br />\nRebecca Garron<br />\n<br />\nSpectator III<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs the current editor of the<br />\nHopkins \"Spectator,\" I feel<br />\nobligated to respond to the<br />\neditorial titled \"Censorship and<br />\nEditorship\" contained in last edition's Opinion section. Although<br />\nthe editorial was extremely confused as a whole, the second part<br />\nof the editorial warrants serious<br />\ncriticism. The distinction made in<br />\nthe editorial between editorship<br />\nand censorship can be considered<br />\nas nothing other than a feeble attempt to legitimate the NewsLetter's recent abuses. The argument that internal editorial productions, such as Mr. Rosen's<br />\nstrip, are subject to the same<br />\nrestrictions as other internal productions, and that censorship<br />\ntherefore isn't censorship when<br />\nthe internal editorial productions<br />\nare the objects of such action is<br />\n<br />\nludicrous. If an internal editorial<br />\nproduction is thought to be<br />\nobscene or libelous, it can be considered the responsibility of an<br />\neditor to prevent its publication;<br />\nhowever, this same responsibility exists with regard to external<br />\neditorial materials submitted for<br />\npublication. That an editorial<br />\nshould be subject to further<br />\nrestrictions just because it is produced internally is difficult to see.<br />\nBecause of the News-Letter's<br />\ndisclaimer, it cannot be said that<br />\nan editorial's internal origin<br />\nnecessarily implies editorial<br />\nboard endorsement; furthermore,<br />\nMr. Rosen's separate identity in<br />\nthe eyes of the public made his<br />\ncartoons distinctly personal<br />\nstatements. Finally, it must be<br />\nwondered what the News-Letter<br />\nhopes to accomplish by applying<br />\na double standard to editorial<br />\ncommentary. If it is considered<br />\nvaluable to place only minimal<br />\nrestrictions upon outside contributions, why is it less desirable<br />\nto be equally liberal in publishing<br />\neditorial commentary submitted<br />\nfrom the inside? I can only hope<br />\nthat the News-Letter recognizes<br />\nthe folly of this new policy in the<br />\nvery near future.<br />\nBrian D.

I<br />\nsee nothing wrong with awarding<br />\nhim an honorary degree, since<br />\nthat has been the JHU policy to<br />\nincumbent presidents who have<br />\nspoken here, but surely he can be<br />\ngiven something more appropriate to his contributions to<br />\nthe country\u2014a degree in<br />\nsomething that would reflect<br />\nGeorge Bush, the man.<br />\nWhat do we know about President Bush? We all know of his<br />\nlong-term interest in athletics.<br />\nFrom four years at Yale, his most<br />\nnotable achievement was being<br />\nthe captain of the baseball team.<br />\nOn of his first decisions upon<br />\nreaching office was where to dig<br />\na pit for tossing horseshoes on the<br />\nWhite House lawn. So the most<br />\nnatural way to associate President<br />\nBush with the Hopkins community is to group him with the<br />\natheletes, but unfortunately<br />\nHopkins doesn't offer a degree in<br />\nphysical education. Luckily,<br />\nthere is not a shortage of accomplishments in the life of our<br />\npresident. What about the oratory<br />\nskill of George \"Read My Lips\"<br />\nBush? No one can forget the<br />\nonslaught of volunteerism that lit<br />\nup our nation like, well, \"a thousand points of light,\" even in our<br />\n<br />\nivory-tower world of Charles<br />\nVillage we can see the decrease<br />\nin violence, crime, and the increased politeness of the<br />\npanhandlers now that we have<br />\nbecome part of a \"kinder, gentler<br />\nnation,\" let's not forget the deft<br />\nand subtle maneuvers of his \"war<br />\non drugs\" that have put Manuel<br />\nNoriega safely behind bars, and<br />\nnow that Marion Barry has been<br />\nnabbed, we are well on our way<br />\nto a \"drug-free America.\" A<br />\ndegree in Public Health in no way<br />\ncovers what Bush has done in his<br />\ntime as President of the United<br />\nStates. Surely his achievements<br />\ncan only be justly rewarded by a<br />\ndegree in S. and B.S. In this way,<br />\nthe administration can give Bush<br />\ndue credit for his achievements<br />\nand allow him to follow in the<br />\nsteps of the' greatHopkins<br />\nathletes.<br />\nC.

Last week's<br />\nspeaker was Rabbi Benjamin<br />\nSteinberg, principal of the Bais<br />\nYaakov School. The evening's<br />\ntopic was \"Schisms in Judaism.\"<br />\nRabbi Steinberg began the lecture with the joke of the Jew who<br />\nwas shipwrecked on a dessert<br />\nisland: the man built two<br />\nsynagogues, one to pray in and<br />\none in which he would not be<br />\ncaught dead.<br />\nSteinberg then discussed<br />\nvarious schisms in Jewish history,<br />\nbeginning with the Biblical accounts of Korah rebelling against<br />\nMoses and the later formation of<br />\nthe breakaway Kingdom on Israel<br />\nfrom the Kingdom of Judah.<br />\nSteinberg established two<br />\ngeneral types of splits: ones that<br />\noperate \"within the parameters of<br />\nJudaism\" and ones that operate<br />\nfrom without.<br />\nHe cited the case of HiIlel and<br />\nShammai, two eminent rabbis<br />\nwho lived roughly 2000 years<br />\nago and who disagreed on nearly every major issue that came<br />\nbefore them. This difference in<br />\nrabbinical opinion did not cause<br />\nthe divisiveness that characterized other schisms such as the birth<br />\nof the Sadducees.<br />\nThe Sadducees rejected rabbinical<br />\nauthority completely and based<br />\ntheir interpretation of the Bible on<br />\na literal understanding of the text.<br />\nWhat developed was a sect whose<br />\nrituals only slightly resembled<br />\nthose of traditional Judaism.<br />\nHillel and Shammai disagreed<br />\nwithin the traditional legal<br />\nframework of Judaism; both of<br />\ntheir opinions remained within<br />\nthe philosophical bounds of<br />\nJudaism. But the Sadducees rejected rabbinical authority come<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\npletely, and as rabbinical<br />\nleadership is essential to the integrity of the religion, this crisis<br />\nresulted in a major schism.<br />\nSimilarly, early Christianity<br />\nwas loosely based on Jewish<br />\ntraditions. However, since it rejected the Temple services and<br />\nrevoked the Sabbath as the traditional day of rest, it was largely<br />\nunpopular with the Jewish community. The Temple was a major symbol to the Jews, and the<br />\nSabbath even today remains an<br />\nintegral part of Jewish life.<br />\nHere again was a case of a<br />\ngroup moving beyond the bounds<br />\nof traditional Judaism. The difference between the Sadducees<br />\nand Christianity is that Christianity drew non-Jewish converts and<br />\nevolved into its own religion,<br />\nwhile the Sadducees remained a<br />\nstrictly Jewish sect.<br />\nSteinberg moved on to the<br />\nKaraite schism in 700 A.D. in<br />\nBabylonia. Mirroring the Sadducees, the Karaites reject the<br />\nrabbinical authority. In the 1100's<br />\nMaimonides noted in his essays<br />\nthat the Karaites remained Jews.<br />\nThere is even a small community of Karaites still in existence in<br />\nthe Old City of Jerusalem.<br />\nSteinberg followed with a quick<br />\nreview of European history<br />\nleading to the formation of<br />\nReform and Conservative<br />\nJudaism. He noted that the<br />\nReform movement was an<br />\noutgrowth of the German<br />\nEnlightenment, the Age of<br />\nReason. There was a general deemphasis of religion on the continent at the time, and by the turn<br />\nof the nineteenth century there<br />\nwas a tremendous push to<br />\nsimplify Jewish tradition and<br />\nritual.<br />\nConservatism was born out of<br />\na concern that the Reform had<br />\n<br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\n<br />\nRabbi Benjamin Steinberg discussed schisms and other differences of<br />\nopinion throughout Jewish history at the meeting of the Union of Jewish<br />\nGraduate Students last week.<br />\n<br />\ngone too far in its overhaul, and<br />\nso they 'conserved' some of the<br />\nmajor points that the Reform had<br />\ndisregarded. Those people who<br />\ncontinued living within the same<br />\nancient boundaries of Judaic law<br />\ncame under the title of 'Orthodox.'<br />\nRabbi Steinberg noted again<br />\nthat \"observance is not a criterion<br />\nof being Jewish.\" He compared<br />\nthe conflicts between the various<br />\nJewish groups to the stress of a<br />\nrope which \"is strained because<br />\n[its composite strands] pull in different directions, unfortunately.\"<br />\nThe last part of the talk was<br />\nbased on audience questions.<br />\nRabbi Steinberg closed his lecture<br />\nby reiterating the point that the<br />\nJews are one people, levels of<br />\n<br />\nobservance aside. He voiced the<br />\nhope that the near future will see<br />\nthe complete reunification of<br />\nthe Jewish people into one harmonious body.<br />\nThe next lecture will be on<br />\nTuesday, February 27th at<br />\n8:00 p.m. in the Multipurpose<br />\nRoom in AMR I. The scheduled speaker is Rabbi Menachem<br />\nGoldberger.<br />\nRabbi Goldberger was the first<br />\nspeaker in the series last<br />\nsemester, when he spoke on the<br />\nmeaning of the High Holidays<br />\nand the idea of forgiveness. His<br />\ntopic this time is \"Sexuality: A<br />\nJewish Perspective.\" There will<br />\nbe a reception afterwards sponsored by the Jewish Students<br />\nAssociation.<br />\n<br />\nUnder the guidance of a mentor, the volunteer will spend two<br />\nyears at this school, receiving the<br />\nsame salary as a certified first<br />\nyear teacher. After the two-year<br />\nperiod, the volunteer will th,;.i<br />\nhave to earn full certification in<br />\norder to continue teaching. Those<br />\nwho wish to go on with careers<br />\nof their own will be strongly encouraged to speak out for educational reforms whenever possible.<br />\nThe Baltimore Sun interviewed area teachers and principals to<br />\nfind out their opinions on the subject. Principal Gertrude Williams<br />\nof the Barclay Elementary School<br />\nwas quoted as saying, \"I think the<br />\nschool systems lose out on a lot<br />\nof strengths by not pulling technicians in from different professions. They are the people who<br />\ncan teach what they know, what<br />\nthey feel, what they love. You<br />\ndon't need a degree in teaching<br />\nfor that.\"<br />\n\"Somewhere along the line,\"<br />\nshe added, \"one of them will<br />\ntouch a spark in these kids, but<br />\nwe're going to have to pay these<br />\npeople. You only get what you<br />\npay for.\"<br />\nStacy Maltzman feels that a<br />\nmain cause for worry is the lack<br />\nof respect given to teachers.<br />\n\"Teachers are professionals, the<br />\nsame as doctors and lawyers.<br />\nThey should be given back that<br />\naura of specialness\u2014they should<br />\nreceive some respect.\"<br />\nThrough this program she is<br />\noptimistic that people will<br />\nbecome aware of the need for<br />\nmore and better teachers.<br />\n\"This program emphasizes that<br />\nneed,\" Maltzman explains. \"It<br />\nemphasizes that we as students<br />\nshould give something back.\"<br />\nApplications are available in<br />\nthe Career Placement Office.

In her senior thesis she<br />\nproposed a program similar to the<br />\nPeace Corps, involving the<br />\nrecruitment of college seniors to<br />\nteach at schools around the country in need of good teachers. This<br />\nproposal became a reality this<br />\nyear in the Teach for America<br />\nprogram.<br />\nHopkins sophomore Stacey<br />\nMaltzman volunteered to attend<br />\nthe information session for Teach<br />\nfor America at Princeton University.

Although \"Prime<br />\nTime\" is composed both of standards and some competent<br />\noriginals, Smith and his band tug<br />\nthis music in directions that are<br />\nboth beguiling and unexpected.<br />\nThe tugging isn't random,<br />\nhowever: Smith dips shrewdly into the wells of big band, bebop,<br />\nrhythm and blues, and even free<br />\njazz to enhance his arrangements.<br />\nWhat makes it all so democratic<br />\nis the unfailing subtlety that, time<br />\nand again, wrings a convincing<br />\nresult from the most unlikely<br />\nsources. Some of the players in<br />\nSmith's band (e.g. the tenor saxophonists) don't always meet the<br />\nchallenge; the rhythm section<br />\nseems at times to play it safe for<br />\ntheir benefit. But the organist<br />\nhimself is sensational, punching<br />\nout rich clusters of bass notes and<br />\n<br />\ntiptoeing through sparse treble<br />\nruns that drift elegantly over the<br />\nrhythm section.<br />\nTellingly, the most familiar<br />\ncompositions on \"Prime Time\"<br />\nare also those that most succeed.<br />\nKenny Burrell's \"Here Comes<br />\nC.T.,\" written for trumpeter<br />\nClark Terry, is at once strident<br />\nand funky. The perennial<br />\n\"Honky Tonk\" boasts an arrangement that puts the highs<br />\nwhere the lows should be, and<br />\nvice versa, but somehow it<br />\nworks\u2014and Smith revivifies one<br />\nof the most tired tunes in jazz.<br />\nThe album's highlight, however,<br />\nis a dense rendition of Duke Ellington's \"C Jam Blues.\" Here<br />\nthe funk is all but absent, and<br />\nSmith's sextet expounds with the<br />\nenergy and economy of a fullfledged big band.<br />\n\u2014T.H. Kern<br />\nPublic Enemy\u2014\"Welcome to<br />\nthe Terrordome\"<br />\n(Def Jam)<br />\nLast year, Public Enemy's<br />\nwell-documented theater of hate<br />\nwas reduced to just plain theater<br />\nwhen the band was charged with<br />\ncirculating virulent racist and<br />\nanti-Semitic propaganda. Despite<br />\n<br />\nthe group's indignant denial of<br />\nthe charges, the future of Public<br />\nEnemy seemed hazy at best.<br />\nAfter the firing, rehiring, refiring, and once again rehiring of<br />\nthe group's \"Minister of Information,\" Professor Griff (who<br />\nwas blamed for a good deal of the<br />\nmischief), Public Enemy has<br />\nreturned with \"Welcome to the<br />\nTerrordome,\" their first single<br />\nsince last summer's belligerent<br />\n\"Fight the Power.\"<br />\nAs a teaser for their forthcoming third album,\"Fear of a Black<br />\nPlanet,\" \"Terrordome\" leaves<br />\ntypically little to the imagination.<br />\nThe track is built on many of the<br />\nsame ideas that have characterized Public Enemy's sharp urban<br />\nmixes in the past, and the result<br />\nis a dizzying, brittle wall of<br />\nsounds. Lead rapper Chuck D.'s<br />\ngrowling vocal refers to several<br />\noutbursts of racial violence in the<br />\nUnited States last year, warning<br />\nthat \"Crucifixion ain't no fiction\" and that \"every brother<br />\nain't a brother.\"<br />\nIt's tough stuff, although the<br />\nabrasive exterior here can't<br />\ndisguise the slightness of this selfrighteous \"Us vs. White<br />\nAmerica\" rhetoric, which is as<br />\n<br />\nJazz organ virtuoso Jimmy Smith<br />\nraces will begin in conversation,<br />\nnot condemnation.<br />\n\u2014John H. Park<br />\n<br />\nvoid of insight as it is of responsiblility. Coming from a band<br />\nwhose<br />\ncontradictions of<br />\nphilosophy and personality are<br />\nwell known, it seems about as<br />\ncredible as the \"official word\"<br />\nof certain Central American<br />\ngovernments. If this band ever<br />\ndecides to grow up, they might<br />\nrealize that accord between the<br />\n<br />\nPeter Murphy\u2014Deep (Beggars<br />\nBanquet/RCA)<br />\nI'm not going to criticize the<br />\nfact that this album effectively<br />\nonly contains one song; many<br />\ngood musicians generate batches<br />\n<br />\nof similar-sounding music. The<br />\nproblem with \"Deep\" is<br />\nsomewhat bigger: the model song<br />\nisn't especially good. The album<br />\nrepresents a good effort; clearly<br />\nMurphy is a thoughtful, careful<br />\nmusician. But his lyrics, which<br />\nmay appear mystical at a casual<br />\nglance, don't hold up. Oblique<br />\nSee RECORDS, 11<br />\n<br />\nMOVIES<br />\n<br />\n'Men Don't Leave' Another<br />\nVictory for Paul Brickman<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nMid-winter movie surprises are<br />\nfew and far between, but Paul<br />\nBrickman's \"Men Don't Leave\"<br />\nis a triumph of style and<br />\nsubstance. Shot predominantly in<br />\nBaltimore, the film manipulates<br />\nreality in an honest way. It provokes emotions, but doesn't leave<br />\na residue of embarassment<br />\nafterwards.<br />\nBeth Macauley (Jessica<br />\nLange), her husband John (Tom<br />\nMason) and sons Matt (Charlie<br />\nKorsko) and Chris (Chris O'Donnell) live the good life in rural<br />\nMaryland. John's an architect,<br />\nthe kids are attractive and responsible, and Beth cooks them meals<br />\nfrom the four basic food groups.<br />\nEverything's in order, but it<br />\ndoesn't take a genius to realize<br />\nthat things aren't going to stay<br />\nthat way.<br />\nWhen John is killed in an explosion, \"Men Don't Leave\"<br />\n<br />\nshifts into surreal overdrive. Beth<br />\nwanders aimlessly through<br />\nhospital corridors (Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, to be precise) to identify his body. She ends up in a kitchen basement, slumping into a<br />\ncorner as endless rows of Asian<br />\nemployees slice up raw chicken<br />\nfor hospital meals.<br />\nThis is just one of Brickman's<br />\npeculiar but compelling visual<br />\nselections. \"Men Don't Leave\"<br />\nopens with stunning expressive<br />\nimages of Matt racing a train as<br />\nhe runs towards his home on a<br />\nrainy night; it's as if Brickman<br />\nwere holding a carrot in front of<br />\nhis camera. And then Matt is inside, his gentle voice reminiscing<br />\nabout his salvation, his father rubbing and kneading his feet between his hands in front of a fire.<br />\nLike the rest of \"Men Don't<br />\nLeave,\" the opener is a visual<br />\nknockout. These moments set the<br />\ntone for the film, presenting the<br />\nremarkably commonplace in a<br />\n<br />\nway that seems daring and tender.<br />\nIt's quite a trick. Brickman's only other work is the indelible<br />\n\"Risky Business.,\" and the product here is equally jazzy and<br />\nchallenging.<br />\nBrickman and co-writer Barbara Benedek (\"The Big Chill\")<br />\nnicely understate the family's<br />\ntremendous emotional trauma. In<br />\nscene after scene, Beth states the<br />\nfacts of the situation, while<br />\nBrickman's pans of the children's<br />\nfaces provide clues to the contrary. Lange is a gifted actress<br />\ngiving a precise performance; the<br />\nwork is far more dynamic than<br />\nher Oscar-nominated role in the<br />\n'mediocre \"Music Box.\"<br />\nBeth decides to move the family to Baltimore after her husband's death, since she needs a<br />\njob as well as a change of o<br />\nscenery. After some initial successes, she loses her job and fails<br />\nin her attempts to start a new relationship with Charles (Arliss<br />\n<br />\nJessica Lange and Arliss Howard in \"Men Don't Leave\"<br />\nHoward), a Baltimore musician.<br />\nHer teenage son moves in with<br />\nJody, (Joan Cusack) a quirky<br />\nradiologist, and young Matt is off<br />\nwith a thuggish grade-school<br />\nfriend, stealing televisions to buy<br />\nlottery tickets and save his<br />\n<br />\nmother.<br />\nBrickman's toughest task is to<br />\nmake sure that his formidable<br />\ndirecting talents don't interfere<br />\nwith his ability to tell a story.<br />\nLike the best work of Martin<br />\nScorsese or Spike Lee, \"Men<br />\n<br />\nDon't Leave\" is stylized, but not<br />\nto distraction. And in return, the<br />\ncharacters speak like real people,<br />\nnot intrusive additions to a completed illustration.<br />\nMuch of the subtlety of\"Men<br />\nSee MOVIES, 11<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak\u2022InternationalExperts\u2022Tour Packages\u2022 Cruises\u2022Free V.I.P.

But<br />\nlyrics that are incomprehensible<br />\nfor their own sake are merely<br />\ncapricious. Likewise music:<br />\nthere's an earnest effort here that<br />\njust doesn't quite work. Maybe<br />\nthere's something incredibly personal or symbolic to this collection of songs, but Murphy isn't<br />\nletting us in on the secret. The net<br />\neffect is vaguely depressing and<br />\nconfusing. The only deep thing<br />\nhere is Peter Murphy's voice . . .<br />\nbut, then again, so is Neil Diamond's.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\nThe Del Fuegos\u2014Smoking in<br />\nthe Fields (RCA)<br />\nAlthough there's nothing<br />\nbreathtakingly original about its<br />\napproach, \"Smoking in the<br />\nFields\" demonstrates that there's<br />\nstill a certain appeal to unvarnished, plain rock. The Del Fuegos<br />\noccupy that nether region between Creedence Clearwater<br />\nRevival and your average dancein-the-Glass-Pavilion hacks.<br />\nThere is, in other words, a whole<br />\nslew of bands that sound<br />\nsomewhat like this; few,<br />\nhowever, are this polished and<br />\nprofessional while still retaining<br />\na level of earthy energy. What's<br />\nbetter, songwriter Dan Zanes<br />\nusually chooses to avoid some of<br />\nthe sleazy lyrics that often afflict<br />\ngroups of this sort (see the<br />\nGeorgia Satellites' \"Open All<br />\nNight\" or any George<br />\nThorogood album). In short,<br />\nwhat we have here are a few guys<br />\nwho sound like they enjoy playing some rock-and-roll\u2014and are<br />\nuncommonly good at it as well.<br />\nRefreshing, yes?<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\n<br />\nThe Ian Lowery Group\u2014\"King<br />\nBlank To\" (Beggars Banquet/RCA)<br />\nIt's rather appropriate that this<br />\nalbum has been released on<br />\nRCA's Beggars Banquet label.<br />\nThe Ian Lowery Group, formerly known as King Blank (the<br />\nalbum title and group name run<br />\n' together on the jacket to read<br />\n\"King Blank To The Ian Lowery<br />\nGroup.\" And it's a transition<br />\nalbum. How cute.) are making<br />\nsuch a concerted effort to sound<br />\nand look like the circa-1970 Rolling Stones that I wondered at first<br />\nwhether I'd received a copy of<br />\n\"Sticky Fingers\" in the wrong<br />\njacket.<br />\nThis thought lasted about two<br />\nminutes into the first track,<br />\nthough. The Stones' hallmarks<br />\nhave always been raunchy sound,<br />\nsloppy production, and sleazy<br />\n<br />\nimage\u2014but with obvious thought<br />\nand energy behind it all. \"King<br />\nBlank To\" hasn't one-tenth of the<br />\nskill that went into the Stones'<br />\nclassic works. Moreover, the<br />\nenergy that made the Stones'<br />\ncavalier attitude towards craftsmanship hold together is<br />\nsomehow removed from this<br />\nalbum. It's there, hut the overwhelming feeling is sort of<br />\nplastic, a bit contrived. There's<br />\na kind of wall between the band<br />\nand the listener that doesn't let the<br />\nraw power come through. The<br />\nresult is merely Spinal Tap by<br />\n<br />\nbecome almost a joke to call any<br />\nfolky album \"Dylan-esque,\" but<br />\nKinney's writing style doesn't<br />\nmake any pretension of hiding its<br />\norigins\u2014even down to the title,<br />\nwhich suggests the Greenwich<br />\nVillage roots of both Dylan's and<br />\nKinney's careers.<br />\nIn fact, that's really the only<br />\ncriticism one can make. Kinney<br />\nis a good lyricist and a careful<br />\nperformer and has recorded an<br />\nexcellent album. But there's little new here. If \"MacDougal<br />\nBlues\" had been released in<br />\n1965, it would have become one<br />\n<br />\nof the greatest albums of the sixties; as it is, the effect, while not<br />\nbad, is nothing new. And does<br />\nanyone know where the \"I\" in<br />\nKevn Kinney's name has gone,<br />\nanyway? Come to think of it, it's<br />\nprobably on a pilgrimage to Hibbing, Minnesota.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\nEditor's note: Of this week's<br />\nalbums, all of the releases were<br />\nreviewed in LPformat, exceptfor<br />\nKevn Kinney's \"Macdougal<br />\nBlues,\" which was reviewed on<br />\nCD.<br />\n<br />\nPiraf es wifkouf Parrots<br />\nMOVIES<br />\n<br />\n'Men Don't Leave'<br />\nMOVIES, from 10<br />\nDon't Leave\" is forged from<br />\nsheer denial. There isn't much<br />\nroom for melodrama when none<br />\nof the characters are talking about<br />\nthe problem. The sadness that<br />\nBeth had battled successfully<br />\nfinally gets the better of her, and<br />\nshe decides to stay in bed for days<br />\nat a time. The remarkably short<br />\ngrieving period immediately after<br />\nthe death would be problematic<br />\nif there weren't some sort of a<br />\nrelapse.<br />\nBaltimore isn't the source of<br />\nBeth's malaise, but like any<br />\ncity it can be achingly lonely and<br />\nalmost suffocating. The territorial<br />\nborders of the city also serve a<br />\nlimiting function, forcing the<br />\nloose subplots of the two sons to<br />\nremain within the confines of the<br />\nnarrative structure. When Matt<br />\nruns to his family's old house, the<br />\nimportance is understood; he has<br />\nliterally stepped out of bounds.<br />\nCharm City is represented well<br />\n<br />\nKevn Kinney (above) and Peter<br />\nMurphy (right) offer radically<br />\ndifferent talents on their recent<br />\nsolo albums.<br />\ncomparison. If you desperately<br />\nneed a new Stones album, stick<br />\nto \"Steel Wheels.\" Copycats are<br />\nno fun, and these guys are in over<br />\ntheir \"Blank\"-ing heads.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\nKevn Kinney\u2014MacDougal<br />\nBlues (Island)<br />\n\"MacDougal Blues\" was produced by Peter Buck (of<br />\nR.E.M.), so one might think<br />\nKevn Kinney would show his<br />\nmentor's influence, right?<br />\nWrong. Actually, \"MacDougal<br />\nBlues\" is simple, thoughtful<br />\nlatter-day folk rock. The album<br />\nrelies almost completely upon<br />\nacoustic instruments although<br />\nKinney's arrangements sound as<br />\nthough they'd be very much at<br />\nhome in a grungier format.(The<br />\ntitle track would also sit comfortably on a Who record.)

Among the guests are the<br />\nstock broker who unwittingly<br />\nleads to Stewart's demise, the<br />\nyoung male fashion designer who<br />\n<br />\npretends to be gay so he'll be accepted in the industry, and a crotchety old bum who sounds a bit<br />\nlike Redd Foxx. It's quite a<br />\ngroup.<br />\nBoorman seems to be trying to<br />\nevoke the old Disney feeling of<br />\nmovies like \"Chitty Chitty Bang<br />\nBang,\" where a group of slightly bent but likable characters do<br />\nslightly bent but likable things.<br />\nUnfortunately, the result is more<br />\nlike \"Esacpe from Witch Mountain.\"<br />\nThere isn't a single character<br />\nwith which to sympathize in<br />\n\"Where the Heart Is.\" Uma<br />\nThurman is the only bright note;<br />\nshe slinks in and out of the film<br />\nwith undeniable grace. Still, even<br />\nshe is a mockery, a mere parody<br />\nof real wealthy people. Boorman<br />\ncan't score points with his moral<br />\nwhen he tries so hard to\u2014and<br />\nsucceeds at\u2014painting the McBain<br />\nfamily as unreal.<br />\nEven when McBain loses his<br />\ncompany and all of his material<br />\n<br />\nSuzy Amis and Uma Thurman in a scene from \"Where the Heart Is\"<br />\n<br />\nwealth, it is difficult to muster<br />\nmore than a whiff of concern. All<br />\nof the McBains' moping and selfloathing is nothing short of<br />\nnauseating. \"Just be yourself,\"<br />\nMcBain tells his wife, and she<br />\nresponds, \"That's the last person<br />\nI want to be.\" Enough already.<br />\n<br />\nfor students and senior citizens.<br />\nThe program is also sponsored by<br />\nthe Hopkins Women's Forum.<br />\nFor further information, call<br />\n448-2650.<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra will perform<br />\nchamber music on Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 24, at 8:00 p.m. in the<br />\nGreat Hall.

We are<br />\nlooking for people-oriented students to assist in the<br />\nrecruitment process by conducting the traditional oncampus interview. Ideal candidates will enjoy speaking<br />\nwith prospective students and their parents. Students<br />\nmust be poised and mature, and posess tact, diplomacy<br />\nand the ability to put high school students and their<br />\nparents at ease.<br />\nTo be eligible, a student must be a senior or a junior<br />\nnext fall in good standing. Interns must be able to talk<br />\nabout Johns Hopkins in an informed and positive way,<br />\nhave a desire to participate in the recruitment process,<br />\nand be comfortable interacting with others.<br />\nInterns will be responsible for conducting admissions<br />\ninterviews with prospective students, and meeting their<br />\nparents and responding to their questions and concerns.<br />\nIn addition, interns will compose written summary<br />\nreports of each interview. This will involve three or four<br />\nhour-long interviews each week from mid-September<br />\nthrough April. Further responsibilities pertinent to the<br />\nAdmissions function may be added by the Director of<br />\nAdmissions as the year progresses.<br />\nThe initial interviews of interns will take place on<br />\nMarch 12, 13 & 14, with second interviews scheduled<br />\non March 26, 27 and 28. The training program for those<br />\ninterns selected will be just after final examinations and<br />\nat the beginning of first semester next year. Interns<br />\nmust be available at these times.<br />\nAny student interested should send a letter indicating<br />\nhis or her interest and listing two references, to Richard<br />\nM.

Government research organizations and<br />\neducation authorities say the only way to avoid this crisis is to<br />\ndevelop the potential of the<br />\ngroups which are underrepresented in the scientific community, namely non-Caucasians<br />\nand women. Because women<br />\nmake up 51 percent of the population but account for only 11 percent of scientific personnel, they<br />\npossess a special potential for improving the ranks of U.S.<br />\nscientists.<br />\nBoth the National Science<br />\nFoundation and the Office of<br />\nTechnology Assessment of the<br />\nU.S. Congress predict severe<br />\nshortages in the number of Ph.D.<br />\nscientists by the year 2000. Since<br />\nbirth rates among the middle and<br />\nupper classes are decreasing, the<br />\ntraditionally dominant group in<br />\nthe sciences, white males, is<br />\nbecoming scarce. Also, many<br />\nyoung people are opting for<br />\nbusiness or law school, routes<br />\nwhich promise high salaries and<br />\nquick entry into the workforce.<br />\nWomen comprise the largest of<br />\nthe underrepresented groups and<br />\ntherefore can provide the greatest<br />\nboost to the scientific community. Tracing the progress of<br />\nwomen through the system shows<br />\na slightly smaller number of<br />\nwomen than men choosing<br />\nscience majors in college, and<br />\neven fewer continuing on to<br />\ngraduate school and scientific<br />\nemployment. While women<br />\ngraduate with 38 percent of the<br />\nscience<br />\nand<br />\nengineering<br />\nbachelor's degrees, they receive<br />\nonly 25 percent of the science and<br />\nengineering doctorates, and till<br />\n<br />\nonly 13 percent of the doctorate<br />\npositions in science and<br />\nengineering.<br />\nReasons for this attrition are<br />\ndifficult to understand in light of<br />\nthe similarity of women's and<br />\nmen's qualifications when beginning their careers. Their<br />\nqualifications have three significant similarities. First, among<br />\nthose with doctorates, women's<br />\nstandardized test scores and<br />\nacademic performance are similar<br />\nand sometimes better than men's.<br />\nSecond, among those receiving<br />\ndegrees from top-ranking<br />\nresearch universities, women and<br />\nmen are found in the same proportions. Third, men and women<br />\nare at similar ages when they get<br />\ntheir degrees. Despite the<br />\nsimilarity of their qualifications,<br />\nhigher proportions of female than<br />\nmale Ph.D. graduates were still<br />\nlooking for appropriate employment when their degrees were<br />\nawarded. Although the difference<br />\nat all occurs in the face of equally<br />\ncompetitive academic records<br />\nsuggests that employers<br />\nare hesitant to employ women. A<br />\npreference for employing men<br />\nover women \u2022 is most apparent<br />\nwhen the job market is more<br />\ncompetitive; the higher the<br />\nunemployment rate for males the<br />\ngreater the difference between<br />\nunemployment rates of men and<br />\nwomen. Over all stages of<br />\ncareers, the National Research<br />\nCouncil has found unemployment<br />\nrates for doctorates to be two to<br />\nfive times greater for women than<br />\nfor men.<br />\nWomen who do obtain employment find themselves in lowerstatus, lower-security and lowerpaying jobs than their male colleagues and have a much harder<br />\ntime than men advancing their influence and prestige. Women<br />\nscientsts are less likely than men<br />\nto become associate professors,<br />\na necessary step before becoming<br />\ntenured. Among taose who<br />\n<br />\nreceived degrees between 1970<br />\nand 1974, 41 percent of the men<br />\nhave become associate professors<br />\nversus 28 percent of the women.<br />\nAlthough women were just as apt<br />\nas men to move from a professorship to tenure, to reach that<br />\nsecure and high-ranking tenured<br />\nposition women had a much<br />\nlonger wait. Among the people<br />\nwho earned Ph.D.'s between<br />\n1970 and 1974 and were assistant<br />\nprofessors in 1977,62 percent of<br />\nthe men had been promoted to<br />\nassociate professorship three<br />\nyears later, compared with 44<br />\npercent of the women.<br />\nConsidering the gender differences in rank, a gender difference in salaries is to be expected. In 1985, women's<br />\nsalaries were 77.8 percent of<br />\nmen's for doctoral scientists and<br />\nengineers. According to the National Science Foundation,<br />\nhowever, about one-half of the<br />\ndifference in men's and women's<br />\nsalaries cannot be explained by<br />\nfield, sector or employment of<br />\nyears of experience.<br />\nThat there is a bias against<br />\nwomen's work in these fields is<br />\ndifficult to prove. However, one<br />\nstudy conducted in a college<br />\nclassroom was quite revealing.<br />\nEach member of the class received a copy of a scientific paper.<br />\nEach copy was identical, save the<br />\nname of the author, which for one<br />\nhalf of the class was female and<br />\nfor the other half, male. The<br />\nstudents were asked to rate the<br />\npaper on the basis of several<br />\ncriteria, including the quality of<br />\nthe research. On an identical text,<br />\nthe students, both women arid<br />\nmen, who thought the author was<br />\nfemale ranked the author lower<br />\non each criterion than their peers<br />\nwho ranked the male-authored<br />\npaper. This study illustrates that<br />\npreconceived ideas and norm bias<br />\neveryone's judgement.<br />\nAlthough preconceived notions<br />\nand outright discrimination<br />\n<br />\nYou may have heard of air<br />\npollution, noise pollution, and<br />\ntoxic pollution. But now you may<br />\nhave to get ready for something<br />\nelse: E-M (electromagnetic)<br />\npollution. Scientists are beginning to discover that electromagnetic fields may have un\u2022 foreseen effects on people. A recent University of Colorado study<br />\ndocumented that electric power<br />\nlines may in fact cause cancer.<br />\nThe researcher noted that there<br />\nwas a statistically higher incidence (close to 30 percent) of<br />\ncases of leukemia in families in<br />\nneighborhoods where the houses<br />\nwere under or adjacent to a running electric power line<br />\n(measured against control communities that were several yards<br />\naway.) About the same time, a<br />\ngovernment agency demonstrated<br />\nconclusive links between VDT's<br />\n(video terminal displays) and<br />\nand/or<br />\nglaucoma<br />\nfacial<br />\nmelanomas in users.<br />\nNone of this is anything new.<br />\nScientists in the 1960's were<br />\nalready beginning to realize that<br />\nELF (Extra Low Frequency)<br />\nwave<br />\nemitters\u2014such<br />\nas<br />\nmicrowave towers\u2014might be inducing cancer in an unsuspecting<br />\npopulace. Soviet researchers<br />\ndiscovered that even low-intensity<br />\nelectrical fields could disorient<br />\nand confuse animals, and over<br />\nprolonged periods of time might<br />\neven be deleterious to their<br />\nhealth. In 1969, scientists found<br />\nan unsettling correspondence between the apex of the sun's<br />\neleven-year sunspot cycle<br />\n(resulting in really spectacular<br />\ndisplays of Aurora Borealis from<br />\nthe increased electromagnetic activity) and outbreaks of influenza.<br />\nEven more controversial were<br />\nsuggestions that electrical fields<br />\nmight influence human behavior.<br />\nDavid V. Tansley noted in a<br />\nstudy that people exposed to an<br />\nenvironment with high positive<br />\n<br />\nionization tended to become irritable, restless, and hyperactive;<br />\non the other hand, those in places<br />\nwith a preponderance of negative<br />\nions\u2014which occur naturally<br />\naround waterfalls and other<br />\nplaces of fast-moving water\u2014<br />\nbecome more calm and relaxed.<br />\nPsychologists in the 1940's were<br />\nalready beginning to realize that<br />\ndirect electrical stimulation of<br />\nneurons could trigger long-lapsed<br />\nmemories or sensations; other<br />\ndoctors discovered that a lowvoltage current combined with<br />\nsteel acupuncture needles could<br />\ninduce anaesthesia. Research<br />\nshowed that e ilepsy was actual-<br />\n<br />\nagainst women can account for<br />\nsome of the differences, other<br />\nhandicaps hinder a woman's<br />\ncareer advancement. In graduate<br />\nschool, women are more likely<br />\nthan men to be self-supporting\u2014a<br />\nlikelihood which may contribute<br />\nto the greater proportion of<br />\ndropouts amoung female Ph.D.<br />\ncandidates. In 1984, 34 percent<br />\nof women versus 26 percent of<br />\nmen were paying for their<br />\ngraduate degrees on their own.<br />\nThe largest source of financial<br />\nsupport for both men and women<br />\nwas the university. However, 54<br />\npercent of men versus 42 percent<br />\nof women were receiving such<br />\nsupport. While the percentages of<br />\nmen and women receiving aid as<br />\nteaching assistants were roughly<br />\nequal, 31 percent of men were<br />\nresearch assistants compared with<br />\n19 percent of women. Since most<br />\nscientists work in research positions, a lack of research experience subsequently limits the<br />\nquality of future research. The<br />\nyears during which a career is<br />\nmost demanding are also the time<br />\nwhen women must make decisions about childbearing, decisions which will delay and<br />\nperhaps hinder their chances for<br />\nadvancement. Some institutions<br />\nhave initiated family support programs. Such policies are generally seen not as family support but<br />\nrather as support for women<br />\nwhich, for some policy makers,<br />\nreduces the priority of such<br />\nprograms.<br />\nA final problem which<br />\ndiscourages women from continuing in science is the feeling of<br />\nbeing an outsider in the man's<br />\nworld of science and technology.<br />\nAs a female graduate student in<br />\nbiology at Johns Hopkins University put it, \"before I began work-<br />\n<br />\nMichael Blumhardt<br />\n<br />\nNervous typist flinches<br />\nly a powerful electric 'storm' in<br />\nthe brain.<br />\nHow can all this be possible?<br />\nRecently, doctors have increasingly come to see the body's<br />\nanatomic functioning in electrical<br />\nterms. In addition to the nervous<br />\nsystem, it also appears that the<br />\ncirculation of the blood and the<br />\ngeneration of T-lymphocytes<br />\nmight be electrical in nature.<br />\n(While the latter is not as v ell<br />\nunderstood, it appears the former<br />\ninvolves a quickly etanging<br />\npolarity of the cell v. all.) Professors Harold S. Burr and<br />\nF.S.C.

Now I feel like I have to<br />\ndo better than men.\" A Ph.D.<br />\nresearch scientist at The Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical School finds<br />\nherself sending notes to some of<br />\nher colleagues rather than talking<br />\nto them in person because \"they<br />\nlook at my face and see that I'm<br />\na woman\" and subsequently, she<br />\nthinks, place less value on what<br />\nshe is telling them. Also, the grad<br />\nstudent notes, a man will frequently assume she does not<br />\nknow how to use a piece of equipment and in his explanation she<br />\nrealizes that he knows less than<br />\nher. Both women note that<br />\nassumption of ignorance is proportional to the attractiveness of<br />\nthe women. Men are uncomfortable and slip into macho roles<br />\naround women who are attractive, says the grad student. These<br />\nexperiences reflect assumptions<br />\non the parts of both the men and<br />\nthe women.<br />\nThese postgraduate experiences<br />\nreflect the still-prevalent attitudes<br />\nwhich many undergraduates have<br />\nexperience.<br />\nyet<br />\nto<br />\nUndergraduates are frequently<br />\nunprepared for the challenges<br />\nthey will inevitably face. A recent<br />\ncover article in Time Magazine<br />\nreports that college women do not<br />\nsee discrimination as a problem<br />\nfor them. According to older<br />\nwomen, however, discrimination<br />\nin the working world is still a persistent force. Women can help<br />\nthemselves by getting involved in<br />\nsupport groups and discussion<br />\ngroups in an effort to raise the<br />\n<br />\nvisibility of women scientists.<br />\nThe Organization of Women in<br />\nScience is one such group.<br />\nAnyone interested can contact the<br />\nauthor for more information.<br />\nAlso, of primary importance is<br />\nfor a woman to be certain that she<br />\nchoose a spouse who is fully supportive of her career, does not<br />\nplace the importance of his career<br />\nover hers, and does not have any<br />\npreconceived notions about the<br />\nduties of women and men.<br />\nMost all of these problems stem<br />\nfrom discrimination which takes<br />\ntime to eradicate. Discrimination<br />\nis taught by society. When<br />\nchildren see that managerial and<br />\nprestigious jobs are generally filled by men and supportive jobs<br />\nheld by women, they assume that<br />\na reason exists for such a division. Research also indicates that<br />\nelementary school teachers expect<br />\nand encourage boys to excel in<br />\nmath and girls to excel in English.<br />\nBecause few women are seen in<br />\nthe science fields, people do not<br />\nexpect women to enter into<br />\nscience. As a result, women are<br />\nneither properly trained nor properly supported for science<br />\ncareers. Once the more surmountable barriers of money and<br />\nchildcare are alleviated, however,<br />\nthe number of women reaching<br />\nthe high echelons of the scientific<br />\ncommunity will increase. As<br />\nmore women are in powerful and<br />\nhighly visible positions in science<br />\nfields, increasing numbers of<br />\nyounger women will find pursuing science to be a natural and enjoyable decision.<br />\n<br />\nWhy is there fluoride in toothpaste?<br />\nIt's a good idea to brush after sweets, since sugar is food for bacteria<br />\nthat live in your mouth. These bacteria produce acids which eat away<br />\nat the enamel, the mineral outer coat of teeth. The inner layer, the<br />\ndentine, is weaker and more sensitive to the acids and will start to<br />\nrot away without a protective enamel surface.<br />\nThe minerals get stuck in the plaque, but teeth do reclaim them,<br />\nand fluoride appears to speed the process.<br />\nAlso, enamel on children's teeth is developing. The little fluoride<br />\nion probably steps in for bigger minerals, producing a tighter, and<br />\nthus stronger, crystal structure of enamel.<br />\n<br />\nrounded by electrical fields of<br />\nvarying intensity.<br />\nOne of the persons who<br />\ndisagrees with the elecromagnetic<br />\nhazard theory is Dr. Kenneth<br />\nFoster of the University of PennDepartment<br />\nsylvania<br />\nof<br />\nBioengineering. According to<br />\nFoster, who has become involved in the controversy because of<br />\nan editorial by Phillip Abelson in<br />\nthe magazine Nature, there is no<br />\nreason for concern. He said,\"The<br />\nauthors of the report by the Office of Technology Assessment<br />\n\u2022recommended a policy of 'prudent avoidance' from weak electrical fields such as those given<br />\noff by VDT's and electric<br />\nblankets, especially for pregnant<br />\nwomen.

Both the men's and<br />\nwomen's teams from Hopkins<br />\nwere awarded the title of 1990<br />\nUAA Swimming and Diving<br />\nChampions.<br />\nThe conference championships<br />\nare held as a 3-day meet among<br />\nthe 8 schools in the UAA which<br />\ncompete in swimming, often for<br />\nthe only time during the season.<br />\nThis year, the meet was held at<br />\nWashington University, St.<br />\nLouis. Each day consisted of a<br />\nmorning session of preliminary<br />\nheats, in which the swimmers<br />\ncompeted against each other and<br />\nthe clock in order to place in one<br />\nof the top 16 spots while the evening featured the finals, composed of a championship heat (for<br />\nplaces 1 through 8 from the<br />\nprelims) and a consolation heat<br />\n(for places 9 to 16), which determine the points to be awarded to<br />\nthe teams and individuals.<br />\nDespite the comments that<br />\nwere overheard about the<br />\nHopkins men being noncontenders for this meet, and the<br />\n\\wren having a smali-rossibility of fighting for second place,<br />\nthe Jays went into the meet with<br />\nan extremely positive attitude.<br />\nBoth teams were defending champions in the UAA, and all of the<br />\n<br />\nswimmers felt extremely wellrested. In fact, the statements only served to spur the team on as<br />\nthey decided that they would prove everyone wrong. And they did<br />\nso decisively.<br />\nThe initial day of events set the<br />\ntone for the entire meet. Both<br />\nteams would take the lead with<br />\nthe first event and never relinquish it. As Assistant Coach Jim<br />\n\"Popeye\" Cutrone said, \"We<br />\ndominated the meet from the first<br />\nday on. It was an excellent<br />\nmeet.\"<br />\nThe other teams began to question their assuredness when, in<br />\nthe second event of the day, the<br />\nfirst heat of the Men's 200 yard<br />\nfreestyle relay, freshman Eric<br />\nSteidinger led off with a time of<br />\n20.93 seconds\u2014a time that would<br />\nhave crushed the pool and UAA<br />\nrecords had it been set in an individual event. It did, however,<br />\nrepresent the first male swimming member of the Hopkins team<br />\nto qualify for the NCAA Division<br />\nIII Championships. He was<br />\nfollowed by classmate Aaron<br />\nOsborne with a split of 20.7<br />\nseconds off of a relay start. The<br />\nrelay was filled out by freshmen<br />\nMike Zelman and Ryan Gill, who<br />\nfinished with a time of<br />\n1:25.86\u2014a new pool, UAA,and<br />\nHopkins record that would last<br />\nuntil that evening when Steidinger<br />\nwas joined by junior Steve<br />\nMuchow and seniors Mike Costa<br />\nand John Hsu to win the event<br />\nwith a time of 1:24.26. When<br />\nasked about the fact that the B<br />\nrelay (usually the slower relay)<br />\nwas led by such quick sprinters,<br />\nCutrone merely responded that it<br />\nwas a Freshman Relay, an indication of continuing excellence in<br />\n<br />\nthe future.<br />\nThe domination of the Jays did<br />\nnot end with that event. On the<br />\nfirst night, 94 percent of the<br />\nHopkins swimmers who swam in<br />\nthe morning made it to the evening heats (33 of 35), and in that<br />\nfirst night Hopkins had six firstplace winners (two individual)<br />\nand three second-place swimmers. Junior Melanie Chellman<br />\ntook first in the 200-yard individual medley and in the process set a new pool record, and<br />\nqualified for the 1990 Hopkins<br />\nnational team. After being<br />\nsidelined with an elbow injury for<br />\nthe first half of the season,junior<br />\nJohn Paul Munnich qualified for<br />\nNationals with a second place<br />\ntime of 4:42.27 in the 500-yard<br />\nfreestyle. \"I really didn't believe<br />\nI would qualify this year,\" said<br />\nMunnich once the truth had sunk<br />\nin.<br />\nThe first day was not one of<br />\ncomplete happiness. Senior co-<br />\n<br />\ncaptain Mary Price missed the<br />\nqualifying standard in the 50 yard<br />\nfreestyle by 1/100th of a second;<br />\nshe touched the wall with a<br />\nseason best time of 25.16<br />\nseconds.<br />\nOn the second day, the coaches<br />\nhoped for an even better performance as they felt that Hopkins<br />\nwas stronger in the featured<br />\nevents than those of the previous<br />\nday. Surprisingly, the only individual qualifiers for the<br />\nHopkins national team were not<br />\nevent winners. Freshman<br />\nDanielle Bird took third place in<br />\nthe 200-yard freestyle with a time<br />\nof 1:58.67, and classmate Jim<br />\nQuinn finished the 100-yard<br />\nfreestyle with a time of 1:00.08<br />\nand second place. Both the men's<br />\nand women's 800 freestyle relay<br />\nteams also qualified for Nationals<br />\nas each captured first place, as<br />\nwell as the pool record. Hopkins<br />\nalso took first and second place<br />\nin both the men's and women's<br />\n<br />\n100-yard backstroke. Price and<br />\njunior co-captain Amy Parke<br />\n(1:03.41 and 1:04.03) took the<br />\nhonors in the women's event,<br />\nwhile seniors Mark Rhoades and<br />\nChris Hussin did so for the men<br />\nwith times of 55.00 and 55.08<br />\nrespectively. Junior Scott Herrick<br />\nalso showed tremendous ability<br />\nwhen he took first place in 400<br />\nyard individual medley and set a<br />\nnew pool record with a time of<br />\n4:16.66.<br />\nThe final night of competition<br />\nwas accompanied by an air of excitement, as the teams began with<br />\ncheers for themselves and for<br />\neach other. The University of<br />\nChicago performed an army/synchronized swimming/diving exhibition cheer that included the<br />\nnew found respect that the other<br />\nteams had found for Hopkins.<br />\nAfter the seniors were recognized, the competition began for a<br />\nfinal time and the cheering increased.

The<br />\nsecond half of the race was used<br />\nas a warm-down as Hopkins<br />\nopted to trade a few points at the<br />\nconference level for an extra<br />\nmember on the National Team.<br />\nIn the evening heats, Hussin captured first place in the 200<br />\nbackstroke with a time of<br />\n2:00.01, having previously<br />\nqualified in the event that morning, setting a pool record with a<br />\ntime of 1:59.54. The Blue Jays<br />\ndid not fare as well on Saturday<br />\nnight, and did not capture a single<br />\nfirst place on the final evening.<br />\nHowever, that did not indicate<br />\nbad swimming, as juniors Amy<br />\nParke, Wendy Fenstamaker, and<br />\nMelanie Chellman all improved<br />\ntheir entry times for events at the<br />\nNational Championships.<br />\nSaturday also included the final<br />\nround of diving, and Hopkins<br />\nshowed itself well.

The Jays did<br />\ntheir part, winning their final five<br />\ngames, including Saturday's<br />\n95-80 blowout of Washington<br />\nCollege. When asked where his<br />\nteam stood in the selection process, coach Bill Nelson responded, \"We're on the bubble.\"<br />\nThe easy win over Washington<br />\ncertainly didn't hurt Hopkins'<br />\nchances at a tournament bid, and<br />\na defeat would most likely have<br />\neliminated Hopkins from consideration. \"We knew that if we<br />\nlost we had no chance at all,\"<br />\nsaid senior Joel Siepierski.<br />\nWashington had entered the game<br />\nwith a 20-3 record, with two of<br />\ntheir three losses coming to Division I schools. They were 9-0 in<br />\nthe MAC Southeast Division and<br />\nranked 15th in the country. But<br />\nthis record was not at all intimidating to the Jays, who<br />\nresponded with their best game of<br />\nthe season. \"There was no<br />\nmotivation on my part,\" said<br />\nNelson. \"They knew what was at<br />\nstake. It was an easy game to<br />\ncoach. I just sat there and<br />\nclapped.\"<br />\n\"We were ready for them,\"<br />\nguard Andy Enfield understated.<br />\nSiepierski explained further:<br />\n\"They were ranked high, but we<br />\nknew we could win because the<br />\nother game la two-point<br />\nWashington win January 161 was<br />\nso close.\"<br />\nHopkins was down 4-2 after<br />\n<br />\nthe first minute of play, then went<br />\non an 11-0 run, capped by a driving left-handed scoop shot by<br />\nDave Eikenberg.

The effects of the long Christmas layoff<br />\nwere evident as the Jays combined sloppy defensive play and an<br />\nuninspired offense on the way to<br />\nlosing a 5-2 decision.<br />\nIn the next contest, the Blue<br />\nJays rebounded with a narrow 6-5<br />\nwin at UMBC. Despite missing<br />\nthe entire second line for the<br />\ngame, Hopkins used tenacious<br />\n<br />\nforechecking and a hawking<br />\ndefense to overcome the absence<br />\nof key players.

The 40-team NCAA field is<br />\ndivided into eight regions, with<br />\nbetween four and six teams<br />\nchosen from each. In Hopkins'<br />\nregion, two teams receive<br />\nautomatic bids(one team from the<br />\nNorth and one from the South<br />\nsection) by winning the postseason Middle Atlantic Conference tournaments and two to<br />\nfour teams receive \"at large\"<br />\nbids. In the South, Washington<br />\nCollege and Franklin & Marshall<br />\nappear assured of receiving bids.<br />\nShould Susquehanna fail to get<br />\nthe automatic bid in the North and<br />\nneither Washington nor F&M<br />\nwin in the South, Hopkins has at<br />\nbest a slim chance of getting<br />\nselected because these three<br />\nteams would all most likely<br />\nreceive at-large bids. Hopkins<br />\nwill find out their fate on Sunday.<br />\nThe Jays finished the regular<br />\nseason with a 17-7 record, fourthbest in the region, and won seven<br />\nout of their last eight games.<br />\nTheir winning percentage was the<br />\nbest in Hopkins history and no<br />\nHopkins team had ever won more<br />\nthan 15 games in the regular<br />\nseason. Still, it would be<br />\nsomewhat of a disappointment<br />\nshould they get closed out of the<br />\nNCAA's. No Hopkins team has<br />\nadvanced to the NCAA tournament since the 1973-74 season.<br />\n\"Beating a team ]as good as<br />\nWashington] like that should impress some people,\" said Siepierski. \"I think we deserve to make<br />\nit.

That included diver/swimmer Hope Raschke who placed<br />\n1 1 th in her first year of competitive diving while at the same<br />\ntime competing in six swimming<br />\nevents. On this final night.<br />\nGiangrandi again took second on<br />\nthe 1 meter hoard and Christiensen captured fourth in the 3<br />\nmeter event. Coach Kym Stine<br />\nwas extremely happy, saying that<br />\nin general the divers did very<br />\nwell. The majority of them made<br />\nit to the final rounds and they<br />\nscored about 150 points for the<br />\nteam. Jill and Steve look very<br />\nstrong for Nationals.\"<br />\nThe evening culminated with<br />\nthe awards ceremony. Hopkins<br />\ncoaches George Kennedy and Jim<br />\nCutrone were named the UAA<br />\nSwimming Coaching Staff of the<br />\nYear, and as the team cheered<br />\nthem on they were thrown into<br />\nthe water for the traditional dunking. Then, the team championships were announced. While the<br />\nmajority of teams and spectators<br />\nhad figured out the winner by that<br />\ntime, the points differential sur-<br />\n<br />\nprised many. The Hopkins men<br />\ntook the championship with 1022<br />\npoints\u2014the second place team<br />\nhad only 668. The Lady Jays<br />\nfinished with 761, over 100<br />\npoints ahead of second place<br />\nEmory. As coach Kennedy stated<br />\nafter the meet, \"We weren't<br />\ngiven any respect as a team<br />\nthroughout the year; but when it<br />\ncame down to it, we swam<br />\nfast.\"<br />\nWhile the championship in<br />\nitself meant a lot to both teams,<br />\nit was a landmark for the men's<br />\nteam. This marked the 20th consecutive conference championship won by the Jays, first with<br />\nthe MAC and now with the<br />\nUAA. As Kennedy stated in the<br />\nfirst Wednesday night team<br />\nmeeting. Hopkins can now say<br />\nthat it has had a \"generation of<br />\nexcellence\" with men's team<br />\nswimming. At the awards<br />\nceremony, the men took up the<br />\nchant \"1, 2, 3, ... 20\u2014WE<br />\nWANT MORE,\" much to the<br />\nconfusion of onlookers. We have<br />\nbegun a dynasty in another sport<br />\nat Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe Hopkins swimming program did not have a tremendously<br />\nsuccessful dual meet season according to the record books, with<br />\nthe men compiling a 3-5 record<br />\nand the women a 4-4 total. Part<br />\n<br />\nFencers host UAA's<br />\nSaturday and Sunday<br />\n<br />\nof this can be attributed to the<br />\nnumber of Division I teams<br />\nagainst which they compete, part<br />\nto injury, and part to chance. But<br />\nexcuses aside, the Hopkins swimmers redeemed themselves this<br />\npast weekend, and as Coach Kennedy mentioned, \"when someone<br />\nasks me how our season went, I<br />\ndon't tell them who won or lost<br />\neach dual meet... I tell them how<br />\nwe did at the Conference and Na-<br />\n<br />\nVictories over conference foes<br />\nSUNY-Purchase and Vassar last<br />\nSaturday marked the end of the<br />\nregular season for the men's fencing team.

The Jays<br />\nnow begin the postseason by<br />\nhosting the UAA Championships<br />\nthis weekend.<br />\n<br />\nThe fencers started off slowly<br />\nagainst host SUNY-Purchase, but<br />\nwon handily 16-11(14-8).

He<br />\nwas awarded a \"Public Health<br />\nDisaster !Ph.D.J\" degree, and a<br />\n\"Degree of Menace to Public<br />\nHealth (Master of Public<br />\nHealth I.\"<br />\nAlso present at the protest were<br />\nthe Students for Environmental<br />\nAction, a student group at<br />\nHopkins that has enjoyed<br /><br />\nremarkable growth in the past<br />\nyear. Wearing an SEA T-shirt,<br />\njunior David Pyles, president of<br />\nthe organization, explained why<br />\nhis group had joined the protest.<br />\n\"The man's [Bush's' environmental record is very<br />\npoor,\" he said. \"He tells the<br />\ncountry we'll have a sound environmental policy, yet persists in<br />\nsiding with large corporations and<br />\nbig money,\" he said. \"Our purpose is to make people more<br />\naware of the importance of a continued health global environment<br /><br />\nas well as letting people know that<br />\nBush doesn't deserve the award.\"<br />\nAt 2:15 protesters began to<br />\nmove to the Lower Quadrangle<br />\nand the area around Garland<br />\nField, where students shouted<br />\nslogans, such as \"Health not<br />\nStealth,\" while waiting for<br />\nBush's helicopter to arrive. When<br />\nit finally did arrive, protesters<br />\nchanted \"Hail to the Chief, he's<br />\na liar and a thief.\"<br />\nNot all of the people gathered<br />\non the quad were protesters\u2014<br />\nsome were just curious<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\nri<br /><br />\nft:;<br />\n'<br />\n1<br /><br />\nonlookers.

Freshman Sean Casuy<br />\nheld a sign that read \"We're<br />\nsorry about these Assholes,\" and<br />\nsaid he was \"really embarrassed\" for the President. Said<br />\nCasuy, \"There's a time and a<br />\nplace to protest and this isn't it.\"<br />\nJuniors Andy Gordon and<br />\nBrent Michell said that they<br />\nrespected the protesters' points of<br />\nview but that they did not agree<br />\nwith their methods.

However,<br />\nthese endowments do not provide<br />\nsufficient funding to combat the<br />\nrising cost of Social Security<br />\ntaxes and other federally mandated fees that the University must pay.<br />\n\"When I came to Hopkins, the<br />\nSocial Security bill was 1.2<br />\nmillion dollars a year. Now it's<br />\n17.4 million,\" Muller said. \"It's<br />\nsuch a huge increase, even after<br />\n18 years, so we have to somehow<br />\nfind that money.\"<br />\nContributions to the university are often school-specific, with<br />\nthe School of Medicine getting 47<br />\npercent. There is still money<br />\nallocated to the Homewood<br />\nSchools, but it is in a comparatively disproportionate<br />\namount and is not enough to<br />\nfinance all the services that<br />\nundergraduates are provided for<br />\nby Hopkins--:library facilities,<br />\nlaboratory equipment, extracurricular environment, and so forth.<br />\nThe Hopkins tuition increase is<br />\ncited to be around six to seven<br />\npercent on an annual basis, but<br />\nDean of the G.W.C.

According to VandeLinde,<br /><br />\nClasses Forming Now<br /><br />\nWomen face unique dilemmas<br />\nin coping with alcohol abuse and<br />\ndrug dependency according to<br />\nDr. Emma Stokes, special assistant to the dean of the medical<br />\nschool. Stokes addressed Hopkins<br />\nfaculty, staff, and students at the<br />\nWellness Program's \"Learn at<br />\nLunch\" Series on Wednesday.<br />\nAccording to Stokes, between<br />\nfour and fourteen percent of the<br />\nfemale population suffer from<br />\nalcoholism. Traditionally, studies<br />\nof alcohol abuse used only male<br />\nsubjects, limiting the applicability<br />\nof the studies to women. Many of<br />\nthe pressures which lead women<br />\ninto alcohol dependency appear to<br />\nbe gender-related and were ignored by research which focuses<br />\non male subjects.<br /><br />\nFREE SEMINARS<br />\nto preview what's ahead<br />\n\u2022 selecting a school<br />\n\u2022 completing the application<br />\n\u2022 the admissions exam<br />\n(LSAT, GMAT, GRE)<br /><br />\nMBA Seminar: Feb. 28 or Mar. 4<br />\nLaw School Seminar: Mar. 1<br />\nGraduate School Seminar.

That is the question.<br />\nthere will also be a three to four<br />\npercent increase per student for<br />\nstudent financial aid in real terms<br />\nafter accounting for the tuition increase and the inflation rate.<br /><br />\nministration figures out these<br />\nnumbers. They say it will probably be a six to seven percent of<br />\n$14,000. Does that mean students<br />\nwill have to pay even more of an<br />\nincrease next year? Percentagewise, that seems like what is going to happen.\"<br /><br />\n\"Currently, 19 cents of every<br />\ndollar of tuition we receive goes<br />\nright back to the student,\" said<br />\nVandeLinde. \"Next year, that<br />\nwill be 20 cents of every dollar.<br />\nOne cent more may not seem like<br />\na lot, but it will increase financial aid funds to a half-million<br />\ndollars.\"<br /><br />\nGiangiulio does not see the<br />\nadded services that the money is<br />\nsupposed to fund. Student Council Vice-President Petrina Hsi<br />\nagrees.<br /><br />\nStudent Council President Lou<br />\nGiangiulio, however, does not<br />\nsee the reasoning behind the<br />\n$1,000 increase.<br /><br />\n\"I can understand the cost of<br />\nliving increases,\" said Hsi. \"But,<br />\nthe additional increase in benefits<br />\nwe should receive from our increased tuition do not seem apparent.\"<br /><br />\n\"I don't think another $1,000<br />\nis justifiable,\" said Giangiulio.<br />\n\"It amazes me how the ad-<br /><br />\nDespite the added cost-burden<br />\nthat students will have to face for<br /><br />\nFemale alcoholics marked<br />\nby Tammy Halevy<br /><br />\nIs Law School, Business<br />\nSchool or Graduate School<br />\nin your Future?<br /><br />\nMoreover, Stokes indicated<br />\nthat alcohol abuse by women carries a greater stigma than alcohol<br />\nabuse by men. The attitude exists<br />\nin society whereby women \"are<br />\nnot supposed to have these<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nThe second speaker, Karen<br />\nJones, a recovering drug addict<br />\nand alcoholic, explained,<br />\n\"Women are less allowed to<br />\nviolate certain behavior codes.\"<br />\nIn the eyes of society, women's<br />\nroles as caretakers and nurturers<br />\nshould somehow preclude women<br />\nfrom falling into the trap of<br />\nalcohol dependency. Stokes suggested that friends, family, as<br />\nwell as health care professionals<br />\nare guilty of denying the problem. Other gender-related barriers to eliminating the problems<br />\nof substance abuse by women in-<br /><br />\ndude a \"knowledge deficiency\"<br />\nand lack of research into the<br />\nsubject.<br />\nThe lecture entitled \"Women<br />\nand Alcohol\" was part of the informal noon lectures organized<br />\nby Patricia Martin, director of the<br />\nUniversity's Substance Abuse<br />\nPrevention Program. Programs<br />\nare directed at all members of the<br />\nHopkins community, yet some<br />\nare targeted more directly at<br />\nstudents or staff.

McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: to sleep,<br />\nperchance to dream for just a few<br />\nmore minutes, honest, I swear,<br />\njust let me lie here . . . .<br />\nHere's the thing. Anyone with<br />\na foolproof guar-ron-teed absolutely surefire no-doubt-aboutit way to get up in the morning<br />\nthe minute you need to, raise your<br />\nhand.<br />\nI thought so.<br />\nIt can't be done. Impossible.<br />\nAn integral step in the evolutionary cycle that brought us up<br />\nfrom the basic primeval sludge of<br />\nthe earth into the highly advanced sludge of humanity that we are<br />\ntoday involved a snipping of those<br />\nsegments of DNA that control our<br />\nmetabolic rhythms and our ability to make it on time to 8:00<br />\nclasses. All that talk you hear<br />\nabout \"biological clocks\" on<br />\ncable health networks and in triathlete magazines is a load of<br />\nmonkey liver that was invented to<br />\nmakes us feel better about our own<br />\nshortcomings and to explain the<br />\nexistence of certain freaks who<br />\nnot only get up on time, but also<br />\nhave complete mental control<br />\nover that \"sleep-mousse\" that<br />\nmanages to turn one's hair into<br />\none of the bush-sculptures at Walt<br />\nDisney World.<br />\nWhat's this? Protest from those<br />\nneatly-groomed peppy freaks?<br />\nEveryone has a biological clock?<br />\nNobody really has a problem getting up'?<br />\nYour honor, Exhibit A. The<br />\nSnooze Alarm.<br />\nI've lived with one of my two<br />\npresent roommates now for three<br />\nyears. During two of those years<br />\n(almost), we were on crew<br />\ntogether. Part of crew training requires that those participants get<br />\nup for morning workout the night<br />\nbefore.<br />\nIn any event. This particular<br />\nroommate of mine is what we call<br />\na \"heavy sleeper,\" which really<br />\nmeans that he requires a<br />\ndefibrillator to regain consciousness every morning. Accordingly, he has an alarm clock<br />\nthat is Armageddon itself. It's<br />\nyour standard radio-alarm issue,<br /><br />\ncirca 1975 or so, with flipswitches instead of touchsensitive buttons. Ah, but then,<br />\nit's not standard, it's magic, for<br />\nthis unassuming clock can instantly transform any Debby Boone<br />\nsong into an air raid over Guam.<br />\nWhen this mechanical bird of<br />\nhappiness explodes into song<br />\nevery morning, my roommate<br />\nquickly shuts it off, the moment<br />\nthat the plaster in the ceiling<br />\nbecomes cracked enough to send<br />\na small piece raining onto his<br />\nforehead. However, having lived with this device for most of his<br />\nlife, he is able to make this move<br />\ninstinctively, even in his deepest<br />\nComas.<br />\nIn an effort to drag himself out<br />\nof bed, then, he found it<br />\nnecessary to place the alarm clock<br />\nat the foot of, and a few feet<br />\nbelow, the foot of his bed. This<br />\nway, not only would he be forced to get out of bed, but he would<br />\nallow enough time for two or<br />\nthree thousand fillings in the<br />\nGreater Baltimore area to be<br />\nloosened while the alarm went<br />\noff. But this arrangement was not<br />\nacceptable either, he soon noted,<br />\nfor this actually required him to<br />\nget out of bed in order to hit the<br />\nSnooze Alarm.<br />\nFor those of you not already<br />\nfamiliar with it, the Snooze<br />\nAlarm is a bit of mechanical<br />\ngenius that allows one to interrupt<br />\nany alarm, as it is going off, for<br />\nabout seven to nine minutes. This<br />\nallows one to sneak in an EXTRA<br />\nFIVE MINUTES OF SLEEP<br />\neach morning!! FIVE WHOLE<br />\nMINUTES!! Oh boy! Wow!<br />\nThink of the restful slumber<br />\nyou'd miss otherwise! Thank God<br />\nfor the immeasureable wonderfulness of technology.<br />\nIn order to prevent an addiction<br />\nto Snooze Alarms similar to that<br />\ncreated by biofeedback machines,<br />\nmost clocks have a default built<br />\ninto them which limits the snooze<br />\nalarm to an effectiveness of<br />\ntwenty-five or thirty presses. Increased usage of the Snooze<br />\nSee PUNCH, 7<br /><br />\nBush: Less than humane<br />\nWhile President George Bush and Hopkins dignitaries participated in Commemoration Day exercises in Shriver Hall,<br />\nseveral Hopkins-affiliated groups gathered in protest, in the<br />\nrain, on the steps of Levering Hall. Students and other members<br />\nof the Homewood community, including such diverse groups<br />\nas the Women's Center, Students for Environmental Action,<br />\nthe Progressive Student Union and the School of Public Health,<br />\nrallied against the University's decision to select President Bush<br />\nas the speaker for the Commemoration Day theme: \"Doctoring in America.\"<br />\nDuring the ceremony Bush received an honorary Doctor of<br />\nHumane Letters degree. Unfortunately, the Bush Adminstration's actions toward public health have been less than humane.<br />\nIn this fiscal year alone, the Administration proposes to cut<br />\nfederal public health expenditures by 7 percent. The Administration has already limited Medicaid funding for abortions,<br />\nand deeply cut funding for family planning centers and contraceptive research.<br /><br />\nWith the importance that Bush claims to place on the notion<br />\nof family and American values, how is it that 500,000 women<br />\neach year give birth to children without medical care and that<br />\n42 percent of families headed by single women live beneath<br />\nthe poverty line? A consequence of this poverty is that 40,000<br />\ninfants die in their first year; one-half of these deaths can be<br />\nprevented with increased access to prenatal and maternal health<br />\ncare<br />\nThese facts and figures should be kept in mind when Bush<br />\nspeaks of his Administration's commitment to health care. He<br />\nrefers to Secretary Sullivan's evaluation of cost, quality,and<br />\neffectiveness of care, and of a program to study overall treatment. Such kind and gentle rhetoric is nice enough when looking down from the House on the hill, but an active public health<br />\npolicy is long overdue. Surely a more appropriate Commemoration speaker than President Bush could have been found to<br />\ndiscuss \"Doctoring in America.\"<br /><br />\nA new mission for Johns Hopkins<br />\nWhile President Muller has done a great deal for the Johns<br />\nHopkins University as a whole over the past twenty years, the<br />\nundergraduate division has not received as much attention as<br />\nit deserves. While the School of Arts and Sciences still offers<br />\na combination of small classes and a truly worldly faculty that<br />\nfew schools can match, current budgetary problems have shaken<br />\nstudent confidence in the University's commitment to its<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nOur next president must respond to this unease not with<br />\ndollars alone, but with a revolutionary approach to<br />\nundergraduate education: It is time to reinstitute the core curriculum and, in the liberal arts, the mandatory senior thesis.<br />\nThese must be part of a three-pronged philosophy which will<br />\ndecisively set a Hopkins undergraduate education apart from<br />\nall other universities.<br />\nFirst, our liberal arts must be kept from falling into the abyss<br />\nof grade inflation which scars so many other schools; an 'A'<br />\nshould be a rare occurrence. One step towards arresting the slide<br />\ntowards grade inflation (still far more controlled here than at<br />\nYale or Stanford\u2014average grades at those schools are said to<br />\nbe nearly 3.8) is to reintroduce the mandatory senior thesis,<br />\na victim of the turbulent 1960's. It is ludicrous that English,<br />\nWriting Seminars, and Political Science majors, for example,<br />\nare not required to submit a supervised thesis in order to<br />\ngraduate. A thesis is an invaluable learning experience, and<br />\nwould allow professors and future employers/graduate schools<br />\nto see if students had gotten anything out of four expensive<br />\nyears. It would also put Hopkins on the academic map as a<br />\nschool which was extremely serious about substantive<br /><br />\nundergraduate liberal arts education.<br />\nSecond, all students, whether in the sciences or in the<br />\nhumanities, should begin with a common core curriculum.<br />\nTwenty-five years ago, all Hopkins students had to take two<br />\nterms of Occidental Civilization. This should be reinstated, in<br />\nconjunction with courses which reflect the globalization of late<br />\ntwentieth-century life. Liberal arts students must also be required to take some hard sciences. The idea that such students<br />\ndon't need a strong quantitative background is absurd and hardly befits an institution with Hopkins' ancestry.<br />\nThird, the University must keep class sizes down. The difficulty some professors are already having with hordes of<br />\nstudents begging for their seminars is alarming. Either the<br />\nUniversity must expand its course offerings, or accept fewer<br />\nstudents. There are plenty of professors who do not teach much,<br />\nif at all. And there are plenty of other schools where sharp<br />\nundergraduates can go if they receive inadequate instruction<br />\nhere. Worst of all, large classes are a betrayal of Hopkins'<br />\ngreatest claim to fame: academic intimacy.<br />\nA well-conceived philosophy of what an undergraduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins should be would help to restore confidence<br />\nin the Arts and Sciences, and would lend greater meaning to<br />\nwhat is often an unpleasant grind. The promotion of a core curriculum and the return of such challenges as the senior thesis,<br />\nwould restore the lustre which is often missing from liberal<br />\narts degrees, and broaden the minds of sometimes myopic scientists. Most of all, a clear philosophy, based on this University's unique and proud past, would give the Arts and Sciences<br />\na sense of direction and meaning.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nSpectator I<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to preface this letter to the editor with a brief statement: relax. I'm not attacking<br />\nanyone; I'm merely addressing<br />\nthe Homewood campus about an<br />\nissue that I think has gained in<br />\nprominence this year. That issue<br />\nis the unprecedented fever of action that has been spreading<br />\nthrough the special interest<br />\ngroups across campus. A fever of<br />\naction is not in and of itself a bad<br />\nthing. The Students for Environmental Action organization<br />\nhas quietly set up special garbage<br />\ncans across campus for glass and<br /><br />\naluminum waste and their project, because of the support of<br />\nstudents, has been an overwhelming success, and hundreds of<br />\npounds of aluminum are accumulated every week. This is<br />\nmodel action. They worked hard,<br />\ndid their thing, and stepped on<br />\nnobody's toes.<br />\nstudent<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\norganizations cannot always work<br />\nthat way. Organizations will get<br />\ntheir toes stepped on, and they<br />\nhave a right to react. I want to address those organizations who<br />\nhave reacted or are considering<br />\nreactions to what they believe<br />\nwere slaps in the face. I appeal<br />\nto your good judgement when I<br />\ntell you that when I use particular<br />\nexamples I am not picking on you<br />\nand am merely using convenient<br />\nexamples.<br />\nFirst, and above all, be objective. Were you really slapped'? To<br />\nuse an overworked example, I appeal to the case of James Rosen.<br />\nThe cartoon that inspired the fervor was not racist. It dealt with<br />\nthe white liberal establishment on<br />\ncampus. Certainly, it could have<br />\nbeen misconstrued as racist, and<br />\nI suspect that the News-Letter<br />\neditors knew that it was not racist<br />\nitself hut would be read as such,<br />\nand that is why they chose not to<br />\nprint it. I believe that most people who have seen it, though,<br /><br />\nwould agree that it was not racist.<br />\nif! have inadvertently stepped on<br />\nsomeone's toes with this remark,<br />\nI'm not sorry, because it was just<br />\nan example to make a point.<br />\nThink about that betbre you write<br />\nin your letters. Think about<br />\nwhether or not I've really hurt<br />\nyou.<br />\nSecondly, I want people to consider how strongly and to whom<br />\nto react. I don't mean to pick, but<br />\nonce again I need an example,<br />\nand the latest available is the<br />\nWomen's Center reaction to the<br />\ninfamous \"2x +I\" strip that appeared in the Spectator. First,<br />\nconsider how strong the reaction<br />\nshould be. Ladies of the<br />\nWomen's Center, the boy was<br />\nkidding. I agree that it was in bad<br />\ntaste; I agree a response was in<br />\norder. But there are limits. Instead of going to the administration and the entire student body<br />\nwith aggressive, shocking flyers,<br />\nmaybe a letter to the editors of the<br />\nSpectator was in order. They are,<br />\nafter all, devoted to the freedom<br />\nof speech. They would most likely print it. Once again I feel the<br />\nneed to remind you that I am not<br />\npicking on you. I am using the example of the \"2x +1\" cartoon<br />\nsimply because it suits my purposes. So, my second point: think<br />\nabout how strong your reaction<br />\nought to be, and to whom it<br />\nshould be directed.<br />\nI am not asking anyone to turn<br />\nthe other cheek. I think strong attacks deserve strong reprisals.<br />\nHowever, I feel stronger that you<br />\nhad better think hard before you<br />\ndrag a more or less innocent student or student group to the administration. Crucifixions went<br />\nout with the Romans. So I close<br />\nwith the same brief statement that<br />\nI started with: relax.<br />\nBenjamin Harris<br /><br />\nSpectator II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a long-time observer of the<br /><br />\nHopkins scene, I am at once<br />\namused\u2014and outraged\u2014that the<br />\nsame institution which condones<br />\nabortion ads, the showing of<br />\nporntlicks, and student takeovers<br />\nof administration buildings in the<br />\nname of \"free speech\" is now attempting to stifle that same<br />\nfreedom by censoring\u2014of all<br />\nthings\u2014cartoons! What Rosen,<br />\nPodurgiel et al. have run up<br />\nagainst is, of course, the radic-lib<br />\nmindset now finding its last<br />\nrefuge in the liberal media and the<br />\ntrendy groves of academia, to<br />\nwit: any point of view will be<br />\ntolerated as long as it does not<br />\noppose radic-lib political dogma.<br />\nFor too long these thougntcontrol fascists have cowed the<br />\nother 95 percent of the campus by<br />\n,loudly labelling any who disagree<br />\nas \"racist\" or \"sexist\". The<br />\nliberal mind (an oxymoron) is<br />\nnotoriously illiberal when it<br />\ncomes to entertaining opposing<br />\nviews, as we all know\u2014which is<br />\nwhy it always has to rely on censorship and fear to maintain its<br />\ngrip. Reasoned discourse, in<br />\nwhich each side is given an equal<br />\nshot,just does not compute: maddened with abstraction and smugly swollen with monumental arrogance, the radic-lib intellectualoid contemptuously dismisses<br />\nall opposition\u2014that's you\u2014out of<br />\nhand. It's really great to see the<br />\nsleeping majority wake up and<br />\nfinally acquire enough guts to<br />\nsay: look, since when have you<br />\nclowns received a private revelation from God that yours is the<br />\nonly opinion to be tolerated'?<br />\nSince Rosen's cartoon has been<br />\ncensored by the very people who<br />\nso piously bleat about the public's<br />\n\"right to know\". you and I cannot make up our own minds about<br />\nit\u2014our friendly thought control<br />\npolice have already done that for<br />\nus very nicely, thank you. But,<br />\nhaving seen Podurgiel's bid for<br />\ncartoon immortality, I have to<br />\nask: just what the hell is all the<br />\nracket about'? Are Die PolizeiSchwestern trying to feed us the<br /><br />\nlaughable notion that women<br />\ndon't size up men in their own<br />\nway? (The word \"hunk\"<br />\nresonates somehow in the<br />\nmemory. . .) Or are they just<br />\ndemanding that women alone<br />\nhave the right to do so? Can they<br />\ns<br />\nbe still trying to peddle the quaint<br />\ntheory, now throughly discredited<br />\nin study after study, that there is<br />\nno difference beyond the physical<br />\nbetween the sexes, 'and that<br />\nequality should mean sameness'?<br />\nOr is it that they are just<br />\npathetically out of touch with the<br />\nreal worla?<br />\nDick Oles '68<br /><br />\nMr. 0/es is the varsity fencing<br />\ncoach at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nEnvironmental Action<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to commend the<br />\nfirst rate operations of the<br />\nStudents for Environmental Action organization. A few short<br />\nmonths ago, it was hard to believe<br />\nthat they were a fledgling student<br />\ngroup. They have transformed<br />\nour campus into a more environmentally conscious community. In retrospect, it is difficult to imagine how the people<br />\nat Hopkins, who should be at the<br />\nforefront of the environmental<br />\nissue, could be so unaware of the<br />\nramifications of our actions. They<br />\nhave actively pursued their mission with the tenacity appropriate<br />\nfor their cause. Without<br />\npreaching or resorting to typically<br />\nimmature and radical acts (they<br />\ncould have done the asinine and<br />\ndump a load of trash landfill in<br />\nthe main office of Seiler's), they<br />\nhave made us realize the gross<br />\nhypocrisy of our deeds as well as<br />\nprove that students are capable of<br />\nrational and professional level<br />\nbehavior and organization.<br />\nI know how hard it is to<br />\nmobilize a group.

With<br />\nthe ascension of television as our<br />\nmain brm of public discourse,<br />\nAmericans have come to expect<br />\nthat even the most serious topics<br />\nbe broaght to them in an exciting<br />\nvisual manner. Nowhere is this<br />\nmore evident than a typical<br />\nbroadcast of network news. The<br />\nmusical theme, attractive<br />\ngraphcs, and handsome anchornen offer a smooth transition<br />\nfrom television's normal programining. While the viewer is<br />\nexpected to distinguish between<br />\nsitcoms and public information,<br />\nthe harmat of network news<br />\nmakes this a difficult process. As<br />\nRobert MacNeil of the MacNeilLehrer News Hour has suggested, the assumptions controlling a news program are \"that<br />\nbite-sized is best, that complexity must be avoided, that nuances<br />\nare dispensable, that qualifications impede the simple message,<br />\nthat visual stimulation is a<br />\nsubstitu:e for thought, and that<br />\nis an<br />\nverbal precision<br />\nanachronism.\" This condemnation o television news may<br />\ndistress the daily viewer, but it<br />\nshould not come as a surprise.<br />\nEntertainment is the business of<br />\ntelevision and news programs are<br />\nno exception.<br />\nTelevision news is never<br />\npresented in context. It would<br />\ntake most of the evening to explain the intricacies in the British<br />\nGovernment every time a decision by Prime Minister Thatcher<br />\nwas anncunced. Without this<br />\ninformation,<br />\nbackgrotmd<br />\nhowever, the decision becomes<br />\njust another fact in a series of<br />\nfragmen:s presented by the<br />\nnewscas:er. Incredibly, most<br />\nAmericans cannot recall a single<br />\nitem of news just a few minutes<br />\nafter watching a news program.<br />\nThis is he direct result of television's eniphasis on entertainment.<br />\nThe viewer's ability to mentally<br />\naddress each topic is curtailed by<br />\na rapid succession of visual images accompanied by unsubstantive commentary. There is no<br />\ntime for rational thought. The<br />\nviewer is set adrift in a sea of<br />\ntrivia and told to fend for himself.<br />\nTelevision news must accomplish the dual goals of relaying information in an entertaining and rapid manner. The<br />\naverage length of each shot on a<br />\nnetwork sitcom is 3.5 seconds.<br />\nOn a typical edition of the evening news, it is approximately two<br />\nseconds. One can hardly keep up<br /><br />\nwith the overwhelming visual<br />\ndisplay and still distinguish what<br />\nis important. A story on Mikhail<br />\nGorbachev's speech in West Germany might be accompanied by<br />\nimages of people cheering in the<br />\nstreets, opinion polls, and the<br />\nWhite House, all of which have<br />\nonly a tenuous relationship to the<br />\ncontent of the presentation. The<br />\nstory is then followed by a<br />\nMcDonald's commercial, which<br />\nis accompanied by images of people cheering in the streets, opinion polls, and the White House,<br />\nall of which have only a tenuous<br />\nrelationship to the product being<br />\nmarketed. The juxtaposition<br />\nseems clear.<br />\nThe real problem with television news is that it is on television. It might help to draw a comparison. Though the smoke signal<br />\nwas once a popular form of communication, it is safe to assume<br />\nthat Indians did not discuss the<br />\nmeaning of life through this<br />\nmedium. Muchawapeh would<br />\nhave run out of wood before he<br />\nwas able to convey his first<br />\nphilosophic axiom to the<br />\nneighboring tribe. The form<br />\ndenied the content. Television<br />\nnews is faced with a similar<br />\ndilemma. With its emphasis on<br />\nvisual imagery, television works<br />\nagainst the presentation of ideas.<br />\nImages supersede the content of<br />\nany verbal message. It would be<br />\ndifficult to concentrate on the<br />\nnews if the anchormen came on<br />\nwithout his clothes. His appearance would mitigate his ability to present information. Less<br />\noutlandish images produce the<br />\nsame effect. The form of television serves as a barrier to effective communication except on a<br />\nbasic, emotional level.<br />\nNeil Postman has suggested<br />\nthat \"The problem with television<br />\nis not that it presents us with<br />\nentertaining subject matter, but<br />\nthat it presents all subject matter<br />\nas entertaining.\" Nowhere is this<br />\nmore evident than in the format<br />\nof television news. Producers are<br />\nconfined by a medium that does<br />\nnot allow for the same rational<br />\npresentation of ideas as does the<br />\nwritten word. One would not<br />\npause in a book for a commercial<br />\nbreak. When television attempts<br />\nto present serious discourse it is<br />\nsimply doing its viewers a disservice. In its own way television is<br />\nas limited as the smoke signal.<br />\nOnly when we realize this can we<br />\nunderstand that the line between<br />\nknowledge and ignorance is easily blurred.<br /><br />\nMEM%<br /><br />\nNext GRO Meeting: 7 March,<br />\n5:30 p.m.\u2014probably in Conference Room A.<br />\nERRATUM<br />\nIn last week's GRO News(16<br />\nFeb.), we made an error concerning the report on the GRO's<br />\nmeeting with delegates from the<br />\nWomen's Center.

It is irresponsible to fail to double-check facts.<br />\nMy apologies to the Women's<br />\nCenter. I made the unfortunate<br />\nmistake of assuming that those<br />\nwomen with whom I spoke were,<br />\nas a few claimed, affiliated with<br />\nthe Women's Center. Further, I<br />\ndid not mean to suggest that the<br />\nWomen's Center had demanded<br />\ncensorship. Censorship was a demand made by a few individuals<br />\nwho represented only themselves,<br />\nnot the Center.<br />\nI would like also, however to<br />\nclarify my position, as it seems<br />\nI failed to make Ms. King understand some of the points in my article. This is a clarification, not<br />\na retraction, and I hope to dispel<br />\nMs. King's criticisms of my<br />\narticle.<br />\nMs. King cites my claim that<br />\nMr. Podurgiel meant no harm as<br />\na defense of his \"primary intention\" to offend. She goes on to<br />\nsuggest that in \"shifting blame\"<br />\nto the Spectator, I do not hold<br />\nindividual contributors responsible for their words. If Ms. King,<br />\nrecalls, I did not defend any intention to offend; I suggested that<br />\nperhaps his intention was to expose: I did not suggest in fact that<br />\nhe did want to expose. I merely<br />\nsuggested that the cartoon can be<br />\ninterpreted differently than it has<br />\nbeen, a distinction so crucial to<br />\nand analysis of<br />\nthe criticisms<br />\njournalistic means and messages.<br />\nPerhaps he meant to offend;<br />\nperhaps he did not. Further, if<br />\nMs. King read my article carefully, she would have seen that I did<br />\nin fact hold Mr. Podurgiel, as a<br />\ncontributor, responsible. I explicitly demanded that he fulfill<br />\nhis obligations as a student and a<br />\ncartoonist by responding to questions directed at the \"all hate<br />\nmail\" tag which appeared at the<br />\ncartoon.<br />\nhis<br />\nof<br />\nend<br />\nMs. King's second criticism\u2014<br />\nthat 1 in fact supported the pulling of funds from the Spectator\u2014<br />\nis valid, and well-heeded; I failed to make clear my position con-<br /><br />\ncerning the Spectator, and<br />\nwould like this opportunity to do<br />\nso. I do not support pulling funds<br />\nfrom any publication, unless a<br />\ncompeting publication is refused<br />\nfunding. I support active and<br />\nvocal publications. I am resistant<br />\nto the stifling of journalistic<br />\nendeavors, no matter how irresponsible those endeavors may<br />\nbe. My suggestion to pull funding<br />\nwas merely to expose options<br />\nother than censorship. I realize<br />\nthat because the Spectator is independently financed (thank you<br />\nfor pointing that out to me), that<br />\nit is difficult to demand from that<br />\nsame organization to fund a rival<br />\npublication. Obviously, pulling<br />\nfunds is only a fair demand when<br />\na theoretically non-partisan group<br />\ndesigned to represent all students<br />\n(i.e., SAC) denies funding to a<br />\nrival. Further, I am not faulting<br />\nthe Spectator with the publication of the cartoon (it seems to me<br />\na journalistic duty). Rather, I fault<br />\nthem with their failure to provide<br />\nearlier a forum for discussion and<br />\nearlier<br />\nfor failure to address<br />\nan issue that they deem adequately dealt with in a cartoon.<br />\nFinally, Ms. King criticizes my<br />\ndemand that all special-interest<br />\ngroups be vocal to all divisive<br />\nissues. What this entails is not the<br />\ntime and energy she cites as<br />\ncrucial to the fulfilment of a<br />\ngroup's goals. Special interest<br />\ngroups should concentrate their<br />\nefforts on that for which they<br />\nbecame a group; it does not,<br />\nhowever, require infinite time<br />\nand energy for a special-interest<br />\ngroup to put out a press release\u2014<br />\na one-paragraph statement\u2014<br />\nconcerning their position on a<br />\ndivisive issue. Silence is a<br />\npolitical statement. All responsible organizations are attuned to<br />\nthe activities of and issues facing<br />\nothers. Because the BSU, JSA,<br />\nthe Women's Center, and other<br />\ngroups are fighting for a larger<br />\nsocial goal\u2014the right to<br />\nautonomy, equal opportunity, and<br />\nacceptance\u2014they should aid each<br />\nother, which only requires a word<br />\nof moral support.<br />\nRebecca Garron<br /><br />\nSpectator III<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs the current editor of the<br />\nHopkins \"Spectator,\" I feel<br />\nobligated to respond to the<br />\neditorial titled \"Censorship and<br />\nEditorship\" contained in last edition's Opinion section. Although<br />\nthe editorial was extremely confused as a whole, the second part<br />\nof the editorial warrants serious<br />\ncriticism. The distinction made in<br />\nthe editorial between editorship<br />\nand censorship can be considered<br />\nas nothing other than a feeble attempt to legitimate the NewsLetter's recent abuses. The argument that internal editorial productions, such as Mr. Rosen's<br />\nstrip, are subject to the same<br />\nrestrictions as other internal productions, and that censorship<br />\ntherefore isn't censorship when<br />\nthe internal editorial productions<br />\nare the objects of such action is<br /><br />\nludicrous. If an internal editorial<br />\nproduction is thought to be<br />\nobscene or libelous, it can be considered the responsibility of an<br />\neditor to prevent its publication;<br />\nhowever, this same responsibility exists with regard to external<br />\neditorial materials submitted for<br />\npublication. That an editorial<br />\nshould be subject to further<br />\nrestrictions just because it is produced internally is difficult to see.<br />\nBecause of the News-Letter's<br />\ndisclaimer, it cannot be said that<br />\nan editorial's internal origin<br />\nnecessarily implies editorial<br />\nboard endorsement; furthermore,<br />\nMr. Rosen's separate identity in<br />\nthe eyes of the public made his<br />\ncartoons distinctly personal<br />\nstatements. Finally, it must be<br />\nwondered what the News-Letter<br />\nhopes to accomplish by applying<br />\na double standard to editorial<br />\ncommentary. If it is considered<br />\nvaluable to place only minimal<br />\nrestrictions upon outside contributions, why is it less desirable<br />\nto be equally liberal in publishing<br />\neditorial commentary submitted<br />\nfrom the inside? I can only hope<br />\nthat the News-Letter recognizes<br />\nthe folly of this new policy in the<br />\nvery near future.<br />\nBrian D.

I<br />\nsee nothing wrong with awarding<br />\nhim an honorary degree, since<br />\nthat has been the JHU policy to<br />\nincumbent presidents who have<br />\nspoken here, but surely he can be<br />\ngiven something more appropriate to his contributions to<br />\nthe country\u2014a degree in<br />\nsomething that would reflect<br />\nGeorge Bush, the man.<br />\nWhat do we know about President Bush? We all know of his<br />\nlong-term interest in athletics.<br />\nFrom four years at Yale, his most<br />\nnotable achievement was being<br />\nthe captain of the baseball team.<br />\nOn of his first decisions upon<br />\nreaching office was where to dig<br />\na pit for tossing horseshoes on the<br />\nWhite House lawn. So the most<br />\nnatural way to associate President<br />\nBush with the Hopkins community is to group him with the<br />\natheletes, but unfortunately<br />\nHopkins doesn't offer a degree in<br />\nphysical education. Luckily,<br />\nthere is not a shortage of accomplishments in the life of our<br />\npresident. What about the oratory<br />\nskill of George \"Read My Lips\"<br />\nBush? No one can forget the<br />\nonslaught of volunteerism that lit<br />\nup our nation like, well, \"a thousand points of light,\" even in our<br /><br />\nivory-tower world of Charles<br />\nVillage we can see the decrease<br />\nin violence, crime, and the increased politeness of the<br />\npanhandlers now that we have<br />\nbecome part of a \"kinder, gentler<br />\nnation,\" let's not forget the deft<br />\nand subtle maneuvers of his \"war<br />\non drugs\" that have put Manuel<br />\nNoriega safely behind bars, and<br />\nnow that Marion Barry has been<br />\nnabbed, we are well on our way<br />\nto a \"drug-free America.\" A<br />\ndegree in Public Health in no way<br />\ncovers what Bush has done in his<br />\ntime as President of the United<br />\nStates. Surely his achievements<br />\ncan only be justly rewarded by a<br />\ndegree in S. and B.S.

Last week's<br />\nspeaker was Rabbi Benjamin<br />\nSteinberg, principal of the Bais<br />\nYaakov School. The evening's<br />\ntopic was \"Schisms in Judaism.\"<br />\nRabbi Steinberg began the lecture with the joke of the Jew who<br />\nwas shipwrecked on a dessert<br />\nisland: the man built two<br />\nsynagogues, one to pray in and<br />\none in which he would not be<br />\ncaught dead.<br />\nSteinberg then discussed<br />\nvarious schisms in Jewish history,<br />\nbeginning with the Biblical accounts of Korah rebelling against<br />\nMoses and the later formation of<br />\nthe breakaway Kingdom on Israel<br />\nfrom the Kingdom of Judah.<br />\nSteinberg established two<br />\ngeneral types of splits: ones that<br />\noperate \"within the parameters of<br />\nJudaism\" and ones that operate<br />\nfrom without.<br />\nHe cited the case of HiIlel and<br />\nShammai, two eminent rabbis<br />\nwho lived roughly 2000 years<br />\nago and who disagreed on nearly every major issue that came<br />\nbefore them. This difference in<br />\nrabbinical opinion did not cause<br />\nthe divisiveness that characterized other schisms such as the birth<br />\nof the Sadducees.<br />\nThe Sadducees rejected rabbinical<br />\nauthority completely and based<br />\ntheir interpretation of the Bible on<br />\na literal understanding of the text.<br />\nWhat developed was a sect whose<br />\nrituals only slightly resembled<br />\nthose of traditional Judaism.<br />\nHillel and Shammai disagreed<br />\nwithin the traditional legal<br />\nframework of Judaism; both of<br />\ntheir opinions remained within<br />\nthe philosophical bounds of<br />\nJudaism. But the Sadducees rejected rabbinical authority come<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\npletely, and as rabbinical<br />\nleadership is essential to the integrity of the religion, this crisis<br />\nresulted in a major schism.<br />\nSimilarly, early Christianity<br />\nwas loosely based on Jewish<br />\ntraditions. However, since it rejected the Temple services and<br />\nrevoked the Sabbath as the traditional day of rest, it was largely<br />\nunpopular with the Jewish community. The Temple was a major symbol to the Jews, and the<br />\nSabbath even today remains an<br />\nintegral part of Jewish life.<br />\nHere again was a case of a<br />\ngroup moving beyond the bounds<br />\nof traditional Judaism. The difference between the Sadducees<br />\nand Christianity is that Christianity drew non-Jewish converts and<br />\nevolved into its own religion,<br />\nwhile the Sadducees remained a<br />\nstrictly Jewish sect.<br />\nSteinberg moved on to the<br />\nKaraite schism in 700 A.D. in<br />\nBabylonia. Mirroring the Sadducees, the Karaites reject the<br />\nrabbinical authority. In the 1100's<br />\nMaimonides noted in his essays<br />\nthat the Karaites remained Jews.<br />\nThere is even a small community of Karaites still in existence in<br />\nthe Old City of Jerusalem.<br />\nSteinberg followed with a quick<br />\nreview of European history<br />\nleading to the formation of<br />\nReform and Conservative<br />\nJudaism. He noted that the<br />\nReform movement was an<br />\noutgrowth of the German<br />\nEnlightenment, the Age of<br />\nReason. There was a general deemphasis of religion on the continent at the time, and by the turn<br />\nof the nineteenth century there<br />\nwas a tremendous push to<br />\nsimplify Jewish tradition and<br />\nritual.<br />\nConservatism was born out of<br />\na concern that the Reform had<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nRabbi Benjamin Steinberg discussed schisms and other differences of<br />\nopinion throughout Jewish history at the meeting of the Union of Jewish<br />\nGraduate Students last week.<br /><br />\ngone too far in its overhaul, and<br />\nso they 'conserved' some of the<br />\nmajor points that the Reform had<br />\ndisregarded. Those people who<br />\ncontinued living within the same<br />\nancient boundaries of Judaic law<br />\ncame under the title of 'Orthodox.'<br />\nRabbi Steinberg noted again<br />\nthat \"observance is not a criterion<br />\nof being Jewish.\" He compared<br />\nthe conflicts between the various<br />\nJewish groups to the stress of a<br />\nrope which \"is strained because<br />\n[its composite strands] pull in different directions, unfortunately.\"<br />\nThe last part of the talk was<br />\nbased on audience questions.<br />\nRabbi Steinberg closed his lecture<br />\nby reiterating the point that the<br />\nJews are one people, levels of<br /><br />\nobservance aside. He voiced the<br />\nhope that the near future will see<br />\nthe complete reunification of<br />\nthe Jewish people into one harmonious body.<br />\nThe next lecture will be on<br />\nTuesday, February 27th at<br />\n8:00 p.m. in the Multipurpose<br />\nRoom in AMR I. The scheduled speaker is Rabbi Menachem<br />\nGoldberger.<br />\nRabbi Goldberger was the first<br />\nspeaker in the series last<br />\nsemester, when he spoke on the<br />\nmeaning of the High Holidays<br />\nand the idea of forgiveness. His<br />\ntopic this time is \"Sexuality: A<br />\nJewish Perspective.\" There will<br />\nbe a reception afterwards sponsored by the Jewish Students<br />\nAssociation.<br /><br />\nUnder the guidance of a mentor, the volunteer will spend two<br />\nyears at this school, receiving the<br />\nsame salary as a certified first<br />\nyear teacher. After the two-year<br />\nperiod, the volunteer will th,;.i<br />\nhave to earn full certification in<br />\norder to continue teaching. Those<br />\nwho wish to go on with careers<br />\nof their own will be strongly encouraged to speak out for educational reforms whenever possible.<br />\nThe Baltimore Sun interviewed area teachers and principals to<br />\nfind out their opinions on the subject. Principal Gertrude Williams<br />\nof the Barclay Elementary School<br />\nwas quoted as saying, \"I think the<br />\nschool systems lose out on a lot<br />\nof strengths by not pulling technicians in from different professions. They are the people who<br />\ncan teach what they know, what<br />\nthey feel, what they love. You<br />\ndon't need a degree in teaching<br />\nfor that.\"<br />\n\"Somewhere along the line,\"<br />\nshe added, \"one of them will<br />\ntouch a spark in these kids, but<br />\nwe're going to have to pay these<br />\npeople. You only get what you<br />\npay for.\"<br />\nStacy Maltzman feels that a<br />\nmain cause for worry is the lack<br />\nof respect given to teachers.<br />\n\"Teachers are professionals, the<br />\nsame as doctors and lawyers.<br />\nThey should be given back that<br />\naura of specialness\u2014they should<br />\nreceive some respect.\"<br />\nThrough this program she is<br />\noptimistic that people will<br />\nbecome aware of the need for<br />\nmore and better teachers.<br />\n\"This program emphasizes that<br />\nneed,\" Maltzman explains. \"It<br />\nemphasizes that we as students<br />\nshould give something back.\"<br />\nApplications are available in<br />\nthe Career Placement Office.

In her senior thesis she<br />\nproposed a program similar to the<br />\nPeace Corps, involving the<br />\nrecruitment of college seniors to<br />\nteach at schools around the country in need of good teachers. This<br />\nproposal became a reality this<br />\nyear in the Teach for America<br />\nprogram.<br />\nHopkins sophomore Stacey<br />\nMaltzman volunteered to attend<br />\nthe information session for Teach<br />\nfor America at Princeton University. She was one of the 100<br />\nvolunteers who attended from all<br />\nover the country.

Although \"Prime<br />\nTime\" is composed both of standards and some competent<br />\noriginals, Smith and his band tug<br />\nthis music in directions that are<br />\nboth beguiling and unexpected.<br />\nThe tugging isn't random,<br />\nhowever: Smith dips shrewdly into the wells of big band, bebop,<br />\nrhythm and blues, and even free<br />\njazz to enhance his arrangements.<br />\nWhat makes it all so democratic<br />\nis the unfailing subtlety that, time<br />\nand again, wrings a convincing<br />\nresult from the most unlikely<br />\nsources. Some of the players in<br />\nSmith's band (e.g. the tenor saxophonists) don't always meet the<br />\nchallenge; the rhythm section<br />\nseems at times to play it safe for<br />\ntheir benefit. But the organist<br />\nhimself is sensational, punching<br />\nout rich clusters of bass notes and<br /><br />\ntiptoeing through sparse treble<br />\nruns that drift elegantly over the<br />\nrhythm section.<br />\nTellingly, the most familiar<br />\ncompositions on \"Prime Time\"<br />\nare also those that most succeed.<br />\nKenny Burrell's \"Here Comes<br />\nC.T.,\" written for trumpeter<br />\nClark Terry, is at once strident<br />\nand funky. The perennial<br />\n\"Honky Tonk\" boasts an arrangement that puts the highs<br />\nwhere the lows should be, and<br />\nvice versa, but somehow it<br />\nworks\u2014and Smith revivifies one<br />\nof the most tired tunes in jazz.<br />\nThe album's highlight, however,<br />\nis a dense rendition of Duke Ellington's \"C Jam Blues.\" Here<br />\nthe funk is all but absent, and<br />\nSmith's sextet expounds with the<br />\nenergy and economy of a fullfledged big band.<br />\n\u2014T.H. Kern<br />\nPublic Enemy\u2014\"Welcome to<br />\nthe Terrordome\"<br />\n(Def Jam)<br />\nLast year, Public Enemy's<br />\nwell-documented theater of hate<br />\nwas reduced to just plain theater<br />\nwhen the band was charged with<br />\ncirculating virulent racist and<br />\nanti-Semitic propaganda. Despite<br /><br />\nthe group's indignant denial of<br />\nthe charges, the future of Public<br />\nEnemy seemed hazy at best.<br />\nAfter the firing, rehiring, refiring, and once again rehiring of<br />\nthe group's \"Minister of Information,\" Professor Griff (who<br />\nwas blamed for a good deal of the<br />\nmischief), Public Enemy has<br />\nreturned with \"Welcome to the<br />\nTerrordome,\" their first single<br />\nsince last summer's belligerent<br />\n\"Fight the Power.\"<br />\nAs a teaser for their forthcoming third album,\"Fear of a Black<br />\nPlanet,\" \"Terrordome\" leaves<br />\ntypically little to the imagination.<br />\nThe track is built on many of the<br />\nsame ideas that have characterized Public Enemy's sharp urban<br />\nmixes in the past, and the result<br />\nis a dizzying, brittle wall of<br />\nsounds. Lead rapper Chuck D.'s<br />\ngrowling vocal refers to several<br />\noutbursts of racial violence in the<br />\nUnited States last year, warning<br />\nthat \"Crucifixion ain't no fiction\" and that \"every brother<br />\nain't a brother.\"<br />\nIt's tough stuff, although the<br />\nabrasive exterior here can't<br />\ndisguise the slightness of this selfrighteous \"Us vs. White<br />\nAmerica\" rhetoric, which is as<br /><br />\nJazz organ virtuoso Jimmy Smith<br />\nraces will begin in conversation,<br />\nnot condemnation.<br />\n\u2014John H. Park<br /><br />\nvoid of insight as it is of responsiblility. Coming from a band<br />\nwhose<br />\ncontradictions of<br />\nphilosophy and personality are<br />\nwell known, it seems about as<br />\ncredible as the \"official word\"<br />\nof certain Central American<br />\ngovernments. If this band ever<br />\ndecides to grow up, they might<br />\nrealize that accord between the<br /><br />\nPeter Murphy\u2014Deep (Beggars<br />\nBanquet/RCA)<br />\nI'm not going to criticize the<br />\nfact that this album effectively<br />\nonly contains one song; many<br />\ngood musicians generate batches<br /><br />\nof similar-sounding music. The<br />\nproblem with \"Deep\" is<br />\nsomewhat bigger: the model song<br />\nisn't especially good. The album<br />\nrepresents a good effort; clearly<br />\nMurphy is a thoughtful, careful<br />\nmusician. But his lyrics, which<br />\nmay appear mystical at a casual<br />\nglance, don't hold up. Oblique<br />\nSee RECORDS, 11<br /><br />\nMOVIES<br /><br />\n'Men Don't Leave' Another<br />\nVictory for Paul Brickman<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nMid-winter movie surprises are<br />\nfew and far between, but Paul<br />\nBrickman's \"Men Don't Leave\"<br />\nis a triumph of style and<br />\nsubstance. Shot predominantly in<br />\nBaltimore, the film manipulates<br />\nreality in an honest way. It provokes emotions, but doesn't leave<br />\na residue of embarassment<br />\nafterwards.<br />\nBeth Macauley (Jessica<br />\nLange), her husband John (Tom<br />\nMason) and sons Matt (Charlie<br />\nKorsko) and Chris (Chris O'Donnell) live the good life in rural<br />\nMaryland. John's an architect,<br />\nthe kids are attractive and responsible, and Beth cooks them meals<br />\nfrom the four basic food groups.<br />\nEverything's in order, but it<br />\ndoesn't take a genius to realize<br />\nthat things aren't going to stay<br />\nthat way.<br />\nWhen John is killed in an explosion, \"Men Don't Leave\"<br /><br />\nshifts into surreal overdrive. Beth<br />\nwanders aimlessly through<br />\nhospital corridors (Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, to be precise) to identify his body. She ends up in a kitchen basement, slumping into a<br />\ncorner as endless rows of Asian<br />\nemployees slice up raw chicken<br />\nfor hospital meals.<br />\nThis is just one of Brickman's<br />\npeculiar but compelling visual<br />\nselections. \"Men Don't Leave\"<br />\nopens with stunning expressive<br />\nimages of Matt racing a train as<br />\nhe runs towards his home on a<br />\nrainy night; it's as if Brickman<br />\nwere holding a carrot in front of<br />\nhis camera. And then Matt is inside, his gentle voice reminiscing<br />\nabout his salvation, his father rubbing and kneading his feet between his hands in front of a fire.<br />\nLike the rest of \"Men Don't<br />\nLeave,\" the opener is a visual<br />\nknockout. These moments set the<br />\ntone for the film, presenting the<br />\nremarkably commonplace in a<br /><br />\nway that seems daring and tender.<br />\nIt's quite a trick. Brickman's only other work is the indelible<br />\n\"Risky Business.,\" and the product here is equally jazzy and<br />\nchallenging.<br />\nBrickman and co-writer Barbara Benedek (\"The Big Chill\")<br />\nnicely understate the family's<br />\ntremendous emotional trauma. In<br />\nscene after scene, Beth states the<br />\nfacts of the situation, while<br />\nBrickman's pans of the children's<br />\nfaces provide clues to the contrary. Lange is a gifted actress<br />\ngiving a precise performance; the<br />\nwork is far more dynamic than<br />\nher Oscar-nominated role in the<br />\n'mediocre \"Music Box.\"<br />\nBeth decides to move the family to Baltimore after her husband's death, since she needs a<br />\njob as well as a change of o<br />\nscenery. After some initial successes, she loses her job and fails<br />\nin her attempts to start a new relationship with Charles (Arliss<br /><br />\nJessica Lange and Arliss Howard in \"Men Don't Leave\"<br />\nHoward), a Baltimore musician.<br />\nHer teenage son moves in with<br />\nJody, (Joan Cusack) a quirky<br />\nradiologist, and young Matt is off<br />\nwith a thuggish grade-school<br />\nfriend, stealing televisions to buy<br />\nlottery tickets and save his<br /><br />\nmother.<br />\nBrickman's toughest task is to<br />\nmake sure that his formidable<br />\ndirecting talents don't interfere<br />\nwith his ability to tell a story.<br />\nLike the best work of Martin<br />\nScorsese or Spike Lee, \"Men<br /><br />\nDon't Leave\" is stylized, but not<br />\nto distraction. And in return, the<br />\ncharacters speak like real people,<br />\nnot intrusive additions to a completed illustration.<br />\nMuch of the subtlety of\"Men<br />\nSee MOVIES, 11<br /><br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak\u2022InternationalExperts\u2022Tour Packages\u2022 Cruises\u2022Free V.I.P.

But<br />\nlyrics that are incomprehensible<br />\nfor their own sake are merely<br />\ncapricious. Likewise music:<br />\nthere's an earnest effort here that<br />\njust doesn't quite work. Maybe<br />\nthere's something incredibly personal or symbolic to this collection of songs, but Murphy isn't<br />\nletting us in on the secret. The net<br />\neffect is vaguely depressing and<br />\nconfusing. The only deep thing<br />\nhere is Peter Murphy's voice . . .<br />\nbut, then again, so is Neil Diamond's.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\nThe Del Fuegos\u2014Smoking in<br />\nthe Fields (RCA)<br />\nAlthough there's nothing<br />\nbreathtakingly original about its<br />\napproach, \"Smoking in the<br />\nFields\" demonstrates that there's<br />\nstill a certain appeal to unvarnished, plain rock. The Del Fuegos<br />\noccupy that nether region between Creedence Clearwater<br />\nRevival and your average dancein-the-Glass-Pavilion hacks.<br />\nThere is, in other words, a whole<br />\nslew of bands that sound<br />\nsomewhat like this; few,<br />\nhowever, are this polished and<br />\nprofessional while still retaining<br />\na level of earthy energy. What's<br />\nbetter, songwriter Dan Zanes<br />\nusually chooses to avoid some of<br />\nthe sleazy lyrics that often afflict<br />\ngroups of this sort (see the<br />\nGeorgia Satellites' \"Open All<br />\nNight\" or any George<br />\nThorogood album). In short,<br />\nwhat we have here are a few guys<br />\nwho sound like they enjoy playing some rock-and-roll\u2014and are<br />\nuncommonly good at it as well.<br />\nRefreshing, yes?<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br /><br />\nThe Ian Lowery Group\u2014\"King<br />\nBlank To\" (Beggars Banquet/RCA)<br />\nIt's rather appropriate that this<br />\nalbum has been released on<br />\nRCA's Beggars Banquet label.<br />\nThe Ian Lowery Group, formerly known as King Blank (the<br />\nalbum title and group name run<br />\n' together on the jacket to read<br />\n\"King Blank To The Ian Lowery<br />\nGroup.\" And it's a transition<br />\nalbum. How cute.) are making<br />\nsuch a concerted effort to sound<br />\nand look like the circa-1970 Rolling Stones that I wondered at first<br />\nwhether I'd received a copy of<br />\n\"Sticky Fingers\" in the wrong<br />\njacket.<br />\nThis thought lasted about two<br />\nminutes into the first track,<br />\nthough. The Stones' hallmarks<br />\nhave always been raunchy sound,<br />\nsloppy production, and sleazy<br /><br />\nimage\u2014but with obvious thought<br />\nand energy behind it all. \"King<br />\nBlank To\" hasn't one-tenth of the<br />\nskill that went into the Stones'<br />\nclassic works. Moreover, the<br />\nenergy that made the Stones'<br />\ncavalier attitude towards craftsmanship hold together is<br />\nsomehow removed from this<br />\nalbum. It's there, hut the overwhelming feeling is sort of<br />\nplastic, a bit contrived. There's<br />\na kind of wall between the band<br />\nand the listener that doesn't let the<br />\nraw power come through. The<br />\nresult is merely Spinal Tap by<br /><br />\nbecome almost a joke to call any<br />\nfolky album \"Dylan-esque,\" but<br />\nKinney's writing style doesn't<br />\nmake any pretension of hiding its<br />\norigins\u2014even down to the title,<br />\nwhich suggests the Greenwich<br />\nVillage roots of both Dylan's and<br />\nKinney's careers.<br />\nIn fact, that's really the only<br />\ncriticism one can make. Kinney<br />\nis a good lyricist and a careful<br />\nperformer and has recorded an<br />\nexcellent album. But there's little new here. If \"MacDougal<br />\nBlues\" had been released in<br />\n1965, it would have become one<br /><br />\nof the greatest albums of the sixties; as it is, the effect, while not<br />\nbad, is nothing new. And does<br />\nanyone know where the \"I\" in<br />\nKevn Kinney's name has gone,<br />\nanyway? Come to think of it, it's<br />\nprobably on a pilgrimage to Hibbing, Minnesota.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\nEditor's note: Of this week's<br />\nalbums, all of the releases were<br />\nreviewed in LPformat, exceptfor<br />\nKevn Kinney's \"Macdougal<br />\nBlues,\" which was reviewed on<br />\nCD.<br /><br />\nPiraf es wifkouf Parrots<br />\nMOVIES<br /><br />\n'Men Don't Leave'<br />\nMOVIES, from 10<br />\nDon't Leave\" is forged from<br />\nsheer denial. There isn't much<br />\nroom for melodrama when none<br />\nof the characters are talking about<br />\nthe problem. The sadness that<br />\nBeth had battled successfully<br />\nfinally gets the better of her, and<br />\nshe decides to stay in bed for days<br />\nat a time. The remarkably short<br />\ngrieving period immediately after<br />\nthe death would be problematic<br />\nif there weren't some sort of a<br />\nrelapse.<br />\nBaltimore isn't the source of<br />\nBeth's malaise, but like any<br />\ncity it can be achingly lonely and<br />\nalmost suffocating. The territorial<br />\nborders of the city also serve a<br />\nlimiting function, forcing the<br />\nloose subplots of the two sons to<br />\nremain within the confines of the<br />\nnarrative structure. When Matt<br />\nruns to his family's old house, the<br />\nimportance is understood; he has<br />\nliterally stepped out of bounds.<br />\nCharm City is represented well<br /><br />\nKevn Kinney (above) and Peter<br />\nMurphy (right) offer radically<br />\ndifferent talents on their recent<br />\nsolo albums.<br />\ncomparison.

Actually, \"MacDougal<br />\nBlues\" is simple, thoughtful<br />\nlatter-day folk rock. The album<br />\nrelies almost completely upon<br />\nacoustic instruments although<br />\nKinney's arrangements sound as<br />\nthough they'd be very much at<br />\nhome in a grungier format.(The<br />\ntitle track would also sit comfortably on a Who record.)

We are<br />\nlooking for people-oriented students to assist in the<br />\nrecruitment process by conducting the traditional oncampus interview. Ideal candidates will enjoy speaking<br />\nwith prospective students and their parents. Students<br />\nmust be poised and mature, and posess tact, diplomacy<br />\nand the ability to put high school students and their<br />\nparents at ease.<br />\nTo be eligible, a student must be a senior or a junior<br />\nnext fall in good standing. Interns must be able to talk<br />\nabout Johns Hopkins in an informed and positive way,<br />\nhave a desire to participate in the recruitment process,<br />\nand be comfortable interacting with others.<br />\nInterns will be responsible for conducting admissions<br />\ninterviews with prospective students, and meeting their<br />\nparents and responding to their questions and concerns.<br />\nIn addition, interns will compose written summary<br />\nreports of each interview. This will involve three or four<br />\nhour-long interviews each week from mid-September<br />\nthrough April. Further responsibilities pertinent to the<br />\nAdmissions function may be added by the Director of<br />\nAdmissions as the year progresses.<br />\nThe initial interviews of interns will take place on<br />\nMarch 12, 13 &amp; 14, with second interviews scheduled<br />\non March 26, 27 and 28. The training program for those<br />\ninterns selected will be just after final examinations and<br />\nat the beginning of first semester next year. Interns<br />\nmust be available at these times.<br />\nAny student interested should send a letter indicating<br />\nhis or her interest and listing two references, to Richard<br />\nM. Fuller, Director of Admissions. Both references must<br />\nbe members of the Johns Hopkins community,<br />\npreferably one member from the faculty and one from<br />\nthe administration.

Government research organizations and<br />\neducation authorities say the only way to avoid this crisis is to<br />\ndevelop the potential of the<br />\ngroups which are underrepresented in the scientific community, namely non-Caucasians<br />\nand women. Because women<br />\nmake up 51 percent of the population but account for only 11 percent of scientific personnel, they<br />\npossess a special potential for improving the ranks of U.S.<br />\nscientists.<br />\nBoth the National Science<br />\nFoundation and the Office of<br />\nTechnology Assessment of the<br />\nU.S. Congress predict severe<br />\nshortages in the number of Ph.D.<br />\nscientists by the year 2000. Since<br />\nbirth rates among the middle and<br />\nupper classes are decreasing, the<br />\ntraditionally dominant group in<br />\nthe sciences, white males, is<br />\nbecoming scarce. Also, many<br />\nyoung people are opting for<br />\nbusiness or law school, routes<br />\nwhich promise high salaries and<br />\nquick entry into the workforce.<br />\nWomen comprise the largest of<br />\nthe underrepresented groups and<br />\ntherefore can provide the greatest<br />\nboost to the scientific community. Tracing the progress of<br />\nwomen through the system shows<br />\na slightly smaller number of<br />\nwomen than men choosing<br />\nscience majors in college, and<br />\neven fewer continuing on to<br />\ngraduate school and scientific<br />\nemployment. While women<br />\ngraduate with 38 percent of the<br />\nscience<br />\nand<br />\nengineering<br />\nbachelor's degrees, they receive<br />\nonly 25 percent of the science and<br />\nengineering doctorates, and till<br /><br />\nonly 13 percent of the doctorate<br />\npositions in science and<br />\nengineering.<br />\nReasons for this attrition are<br />\ndifficult to understand in light of<br />\nthe similarity of women's and<br />\nmen's qualifications when beginning their careers. Their<br />\nqualifications have three significant similarities. First, among<br />\nthose with doctorates, women's<br />\nstandardized test scores and<br />\nacademic performance are similar<br />\nand sometimes better than men's.<br />\nSecond, among those receiving<br />\ndegrees from top-ranking<br />\nresearch universities, women and<br />\nmen are found in the same proportions. Third, men and women<br />\nare at similar ages when they get<br />\ntheir degrees. Despite the<br />\nsimilarity of their qualifications,<br />\nhigher proportions of female than<br />\nmale Ph.D. graduates were still<br />\nlooking for appropriate employment when their degrees were<br />\nawarded. Although the difference<br />\nat all occurs in the face of equally<br />\ncompetitive academic records<br />\nsuggests that employers<br />\nare hesitant to employ women. A<br />\npreference for employing men<br />\nover women \u2022 is most apparent<br />\nwhen the job market is more<br />\ncompetitive; the higher the<br />\nunemployment rate for males the<br />\ngreater the difference between<br />\nunemployment rates of men and<br />\nwomen. Over all stages of<br />\ncareers, the National Research<br />\nCouncil has found unemployment<br />\nrates for doctorates to be two to<br />\nfive times greater for women than<br />\nfor men.<br />\nWomen who do obtain employment find themselves in lowerstatus, lower-security and lowerpaying jobs than their male colleagues and have a much harder<br />\ntime than men advancing their influence and prestige. Women<br />\nscientsts are less likely than men<br />\nto become associate professors,<br />\na necessary step before becoming<br />\ntenured. Among taose who<br /><br />\nreceived degrees between 1970<br />\nand 1974, 41 percent of the men<br />\nhave become associate professors<br />\nversus 28 percent of the women.<br />\nAlthough women were just as apt<br />\nas men to move from a professorship to tenure, to reach that<br />\nsecure and high-ranking tenured<br />\nposition women had a much<br />\nlonger wait. Among the people<br />\nwho earned Ph.D.'s between<br />\n1970 and 1974 and were assistant<br />\nprofessors in 1977,62 percent of<br />\nthe men had been promoted to<br />\nassociate professorship three<br />\nyears later, compared with 44<br />\npercent of the women.<br />\nConsidering the gender differences in rank, a gender difference in salaries is to be expected. In 1985, women's<br />\nsalaries were 77.8 percent of<br />\nmen's for doctoral scientists and<br />\nengineers. According to the National Science Foundation,<br />\nhowever, about one-half of the<br />\ndifference in men's and women's<br />\nsalaries cannot be explained by<br />\nfield, sector or employment of<br />\nyears of experience.<br />\nThat there is a bias against<br />\nwomen's work in these fields is<br />\ndifficult to prove. However, one<br />\nstudy conducted in a college<br />\nclassroom was quite revealing.<br />\nEach member of the class received a copy of a scientific paper.<br />\nEach copy was identical, save the<br />\nname of the author, which for one<br />\nhalf of the class was female and<br />\nfor the other half, male. The<br />\nstudents were asked to rate the<br />\npaper on the basis of several<br />\ncriteria, including the quality of<br />\nthe research. On an identical text,<br />\nthe students, both women arid<br />\nmen, who thought the author was<br />\nfemale ranked the author lower<br />\non each criterion than their peers<br />\nwho ranked the male-authored<br />\npaper. This study illustrates that<br />\npreconceived ideas and norm bias<br />\neveryone's judgement.<br />\nAlthough preconceived notions<br />\nand outright discrimination<br /><br />\nYou may have heard of air<br />\npollution, noise pollution, and<br />\ntoxic pollution. But now you may<br />\nhave to get ready for something<br />\nelse: E-M (electromagnetic)<br />\npollution. Scientists are beginning to discover that electromagnetic fields may have un\u2022 foreseen effects on people. A recent University of Colorado study<br />\ndocumented that electric power<br />\nlines may in fact cause cancer.<br />\nThe researcher noted that there<br />\nwas a statistically higher incidence (close to 30 percent) of<br />\ncases of leukemia in families in<br />\nneighborhoods where the houses<br />\nwere under or adjacent to a running electric power line<br />\n(measured against control communities that were several yards<br />\naway.) About the same time, a<br />\ngovernment agency demonstrated<br />\nconclusive links between VDT's<br />\n(video terminal displays) and<br />\nand/or<br />\nglaucoma<br />\nfacial<br />\nmelanomas in users.<br />\nNone of this is anything new.<br />\nScientists in the 1960's were<br />\nalready beginning to realize that<br />\nELF (Extra Low Frequency)<br />\nwave<br />\nemitters\u2014such<br />\nas<br />\nmicrowave towers\u2014might be inducing cancer in an unsuspecting<br />\npopulace. Soviet researchers<br />\ndiscovered that even low-intensity<br />\nelectrical fields could disorient<br />\nand confuse animals, and over<br />\nprolonged periods of time might<br />\neven be deleterious to their<br />\nhealth. In 1969, scientists found<br />\nan unsettling correspondence between the apex of the sun's<br />\neleven-year sunspot cycle<br />\n(resulting in really spectacular<br />\ndisplays of Aurora Borealis from<br />\nthe increased electromagnetic activity) and outbreaks of influenza.<br />\nEven more controversial were<br />\nsuggestions that electrical fields<br />\nmight influence human behavior.<br />\nDavid V. Tansley noted in a<br />\nstudy that people exposed to an<br />\nenvironment with high positive<br /><br />\nionization tended to become irritable, restless, and hyperactive;<br />\non the other hand, those in places<br />\nwith a preponderance of negative<br />\nions\u2014which occur naturally<br />\naround waterfalls and other<br />\nplaces of fast-moving water\u2014<br />\nbecome more calm and relaxed.<br />\nPsychologists in the 1940's were<br />\nalready beginning to realize that<br />\ndirect electrical stimulation of<br />\nneurons could trigger long-lapsed<br />\nmemories or sensations; other<br />\ndoctors discovered that a lowvoltage current combined with<br />\nsteel acupuncture needles could<br />\ninduce anaesthesia. Research<br />\nshowed that e ilepsy was actual-<br /><br />\nagainst women can account for<br />\nsome of the differences, other<br />\nhandicaps hinder a woman's<br />\ncareer advancement. In graduate<br />\nschool, women are more likely<br />\nthan men to be self-supporting\u2014a<br />\nlikelihood which may contribute<br />\nto the greater proportion of<br />\ndropouts amoung female Ph.D.<br />\ncandidates. In 1984, 34 percent<br />\nof women versus 26 percent of<br />\nmen were paying for their<br />\ngraduate degrees on their own.<br />\nThe largest source of financial<br />\nsupport for both men and women<br />\nwas the university. However, 54<br />\npercent of men versus 42 percent<br />\nof women were receiving such<br />\nsupport. While the percentages of<br />\nmen and women receiving aid as<br />\nteaching assistants were roughly<br />\nequal, 31 percent of men were<br />\nresearch assistants compared with<br />\n19 percent of women. Since most<br />\nscientists work in research positions, a lack of research experience subsequently limits the<br />\nquality of future research. The<br />\nyears during which a career is<br />\nmost demanding are also the time<br />\nwhen women must make decisions about childbearing, decisions which will delay and<br />\nperhaps hinder their chances for<br />\nadvancement. Some institutions<br />\nhave initiated family support programs. Such policies are generally seen not as family support but<br />\nrather as support for women<br />\nwhich, for some policy makers,<br />\nreduces the priority of such<br />\nprograms.<br />\nA final problem which<br />\ndiscourages women from continuing in science is the feeling of<br />\nbeing an outsider in the man's<br />\nworld of science and technology.<br />\nAs a female graduate student in<br />\nbiology at Johns Hopkins University put it, \"before I began work-<br /><br />\nMichael Blumhardt<br /><br />\nNervous typist flinches<br />\nly a powerful electric 'storm' in<br />\nthe brain.<br />\nHow can all this be possible?<br />\nRecently, doctors have increasingly come to see the body's<br />\nanatomic functioning in electrical<br />\nterms. In addition to the nervous<br />\nsystem, it also appears that the<br />\ncirculation of the blood and the<br />\ngeneration of T-lymphocytes<br />\nmight be electrical in nature.<br />\n(While the latter is not as v ell<br />\nunderstood, it appears the former<br />\ninvolves a quickly etanging<br />\npolarity of the cell v. all.) Professors Harold S. Burr and<br />\nF.S.C. Northrop at Yale, using<br />\nan ultra-sensitive microvoltmeter<br />\nto detect changes in potential as<br />\nfeeble as a millionth of a volt between two points on the skin,<br />\ndiscovered that all living,<br />\norganisms might actually be sur-<br /><br />\nby Cristian Tampe<br />\ning I never felt discriminated<br />\nagainst. Now I feel like I have to<br />\ndo better than men.\" A Ph.D.<br />\nresearch scientist at The Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical School finds<br />\nherself sending notes to some of<br />\nher colleagues rather than talking<br />\nto them in person because \"they<br />\nlook at my face and see that I'm<br />\na woman\" and subsequently, she<br />\nthinks, place less value on what<br />\nshe is telling them. Also, the grad<br />\nstudent notes, a man will frequently assume she does not<br />\nknow how to use a piece of equipment and in his explanation she<br />\nrealizes that he knows less than<br />\nher. Both women note that<br />\nassumption of ignorance is proportional to the attractiveness of<br />\nthe women. Men are uncomfortable and slip into macho roles<br />\naround women who are attractive, says the grad student. These<br />\nexperiences reflect assumptions<br />\non the parts of both the men and<br />\nthe women.<br />\nThese postgraduate experiences<br />\nreflect the still-prevalent attitudes<br />\nwhich many undergraduates have<br />\nexperience.<br />\nyet<br />\nto<br />\nUndergraduates are frequently<br />\nunprepared for the challenges<br />\nthey will inevitably face. A recent<br />\ncover article in Time Magazine<br />\nreports that college women do not<br />\nsee discrimination as a problem<br />\nfor them. According to older<br />\nwomen, however, discrimination<br />\nin the working world is still a persistent force. Women can help<br />\nthemselves by getting involved in<br />\nsupport groups and discussion<br />\ngroups in an effort to raise the<br /><br />\nvisibility of women scientists.<br />\nThe Organization of Women in<br />\nScience is one such group.<br />\nAnyone interested can contact the<br />\nauthor for more information.<br />\nAlso, of primary importance is<br />\nfor a woman to be certain that she<br />\nchoose a spouse who is fully supportive of her career, does not<br />\nplace the importance of his career<br />\nover hers, and does not have any<br />\npreconceived notions about the<br />\nduties of women and men.<br />\nMost all of these problems stem<br />\nfrom discrimination which takes<br />\ntime to eradicate. Discrimination<br />\nis taught by society. When<br />\nchildren see that managerial and<br />\nprestigious jobs are generally filled by men and supportive jobs<br />\nheld by women, they assume that<br />\na reason exists for such a division. Research also indicates that<br />\nelementary school teachers expect<br />\nand encourage boys to excel in<br />\nmath and girls to excel in English.<br />\nBecause few women are seen in<br />\nthe science fields, people do not<br />\nexpect women to enter into<br />\nscience. As a result, women are<br />\nneither properly trained nor properly supported for science<br />\ncareers. Once the more surmountable barriers of money and<br />\nchildcare are alleviated, however,<br />\nthe number of women reaching<br />\nthe high echelons of the scientific<br />\ncommunity will increase. As<br />\nmore women are in powerful and<br />\nhighly visible positions in science<br />\nfields, increasing numbers of<br />\nyounger women will find pursuing science to be a natural and enjoyable decision.<br /><br />\nWhy is there fluoride in toothpaste?<br />\nIt's a good idea to brush after sweets, since sugar is food for bacteria<br />\nthat live in your mouth.

The inner layer, the<br />\ndentine, is weaker and more sensitive to the acids and will start to<br />\nrot away without a protective enamel surface.<br />\nThe minerals get stuck in the plaque, but teeth do reclaim them,<br />\nand fluoride appears to speed the process.<br />\nAlso, enamel on children's teeth is developing. The little fluoride<br />\nion probably steps in for bigger minerals, producing a tighter, and<br />\nthus stronger, crystal structure of enamel.<br /><br />\nrounded by electrical fields of<br />\nvarying intensity.<br />\nOne of the persons who<br />\ndisagrees with the elecromagnetic<br />\nhazard theory is Dr. Kenneth<br />\nFoster of the University of PennDepartment<br />\nsylvania<br />\nof<br />\nBioengineering. According to<br />\nFoster, who has become involved in the controversy because of<br />\nan editorial by Phillip Abelson in<br />\nthe magazine Nature, there is no<br />\nreason for concern. He said,\"The<br />\nauthors of the report by the Office of Technology Assessment<br />\n\u2022recommended a policy of 'prudent avoidance' from weak electrical fields such as those given<br />\noff by VDT's and electric<br />\nblankets, especially for pregnant<br />\nwomen.

Both the men's and<br />\nwomen's teams from Hopkins<br />\nwere awarded the title of 1990<br />\nUAA Swimming and Diving<br />\nChampions.<br />\nThe conference championships<br />\nare held as a 3-day meet among<br />\nthe 8 schools in the UAA which<br />\ncompete in swimming, often for<br />\nthe only time during the season.<br />\nThis year, the meet was held at<br />\nWashington University, St.<br />\nLouis. Each day consisted of a<br />\nmorning session of preliminary<br />\nheats, in which the swimmers<br />\ncompeted against each other and<br />\nthe clock in order to place in one<br />\nof the top 16 spots while the evening featured the finals, composed of a championship heat (for<br />\nplaces 1 through 8 from the<br />\nprelims) and a consolation heat<br />\n(for places 9 to 16), which determine the points to be awarded to<br />\nthe teams and individuals.<br />\nDespite the comments that<br />\nwere overheard about the<br />\nHopkins men being noncontenders for this meet, and the<br />\n\\wren having a smali-rossibility of fighting for second place,<br />\nthe Jays went into the meet with<br />\nan extremely positive attitude.<br />\nBoth teams were defending champions in the UAA, and all of the<br /><br />\nswimmers felt extremely wellrested. In fact, the statements only served to spur the team on as<br />\nthey decided that they would prove everyone wrong. And they did<br />\nso decisively.<br />\nThe initial day of events set the<br />\ntone for the entire meet. Both<br />\nteams would take the lead with<br />\nthe first event and never relinquish it. As Assistant Coach Jim<br />\n\"Popeye\" Cutrone said, \"We<br />\ndominated the meet from the first<br />\nday on. It was an excellent<br />\nmeet.\"<br />\nThe other teams began to question their assuredness when, in<br />\nthe second event of the day, the<br />\nfirst heat of the Men's 200 yard<br />\nfreestyle relay, freshman Eric<br />\nSteidinger led off with a time of<br />\n20.93 seconds\u2014a time that would<br />\nhave crushed the pool and UAA<br />\nrecords had it been set in an individual event. It did, however,<br />\nrepresent the first male swimming member of the Hopkins team<br />\nto qualify for the NCAA Division<br />\nIII Championships. He was<br />\nfollowed by classmate Aaron<br />\nOsborne with a split of 20.7<br />\nseconds off of a relay start. The<br />\nrelay was filled out by freshmen<br />\nMike Zelman and Ryan Gill, who<br />\nfinished with a time of<br />\n1:25.86\u2014a new pool, UAA,and<br />\nHopkins record that would last<br />\nuntil that evening when Steidinger<br />\nwas joined by junior Steve<br />\nMuchow and seniors Mike Costa<br />\nand John Hsu to win the event<br />\nwith a time of 1:24.26. When<br />\nasked about the fact that the B<br />\nrelay (usually the slower relay)<br />\nwas led by such quick sprinters,<br />\nCutrone merely responded that it<br />\nwas a Freshman Relay, an indication of continuing excellence in<br /><br />\nthe future.<br />\nThe domination of the Jays did<br />\nnot end with that event. On the<br />\nfirst night, 94 percent of the<br />\nHopkins swimmers who swam in<br />\nthe morning made it to the evening heats (33 of 35), and in that<br />\nfirst night Hopkins had six firstplace winners (two individual)<br />\nand three second-place swimmers. Junior Melanie Chellman<br />\ntook first in the 200-yard individual medley and in the process set a new pool record, and<br />\nqualified for the 1990 Hopkins<br />\nnational team. After being<br />\nsidelined with an elbow injury for<br />\nthe first half of the season,junior<br />\nJohn Paul Munnich qualified for<br />\nNationals with a second place<br />\ntime of 4:42.27 in the 500-yard<br />\nfreestyle. \"I really didn't believe<br />\nI would qualify this year,\" said<br />\nMunnich once the truth had sunk<br />\nin.<br />\nThe first day was not one of<br />\ncomplete happiness. Senior co-<br /><br />\ncaptain Mary Price missed the<br />\nqualifying standard in the 50 yard<br />\nfreestyle by 1/100th of a second;<br />\nshe touched the wall with a<br />\nseason best time of 25.16<br />\nseconds.<br />\nOn the second day, the coaches<br />\nhoped for an even better performance as they felt that Hopkins<br />\nwas stronger in the featured<br />\nevents than those of the previous<br />\nday. Surprisingly, the only individual qualifiers for the<br />\nHopkins national team were not<br />\nevent winners. Freshman<br />\nDanielle Bird took third place in<br />\nthe 200-yard freestyle with a time<br />\nof 1:58.67, and classmate Jim<br />\nQuinn finished the 100-yard<br />\nfreestyle with a time of 1:00.08<br />\nand second place. Both the men's<br />\nand women's 800 freestyle relay<br />\nteams also qualified for Nationals<br />\nas each captured first place, as<br />\nwell as the pool record. Hopkins<br />\nalso took first and second place<br />\nin both the men's and women's<br /><br />\n100-yard backstroke. Price and<br />\njunior co-captain Amy Parke<br />\n(1:03.41 and 1:04.03) took the<br />\nhonors in the women's event,<br />\nwhile seniors Mark Rhoades and<br />\nChris Hussin did so for the men<br />\nwith times of 55.00 and 55.08<br />\nrespectively. Junior Scott Herrick<br />\nalso showed tremendous ability<br />\nwhen he took first place in 400<br />\nyard individual medley and set a<br />\nnew pool record with a time of<br />\n4:16.66.<br />\nThe final night of competition<br />\nwas accompanied by an air of excitement, as the teams began with<br />\ncheers for themselves and for<br />\neach other. The University of<br />\nChicago performed an army/synchronized swimming/diving exhibition cheer that included the<br />\nnew found respect that the other<br />\nteams had found for Hopkins.<br />\nAfter the seniors were recognized, the competition began for a<br />\nfinal time and the cheering increased.

The<br />\nsecond half of the race was used<br />\nas a warm-down as Hopkins<br />\nopted to trade a few points at the<br />\nconference level for an extra<br />\nmember on the National Team.<br />\nIn the evening heats, Hussin captured first place in the 200<br />\nbackstroke with a time of<br />\n2:00.01, having previously<br />\nqualified in the event that morning, setting a pool record with a<br />\ntime of 1:59.54. The Blue Jays<br />\ndid not fare as well on Saturday<br />\nnight, and did not capture a single<br />\nfirst place on the final evening.<br />\nHowever, that did not indicate<br />\nbad swimming, as juniors Amy<br />\nParke, Wendy Fenstamaker, and<br />\nMelanie Chellman all improved<br />\ntheir entry times for events at the<br />\nNational Championships.<br />\nSaturday also included the final<br />\nround of diving, and Hopkins<br />\nshowed itself well.

When asked where his<br />\nteam stood in the selection process, coach Bill Nelson responded, \"We're on the bubble.\"<br />\nThe easy win over Washington<br />\ncertainly didn't hurt Hopkins'<br />\nchances at a tournament bid, and<br />\na defeat would most likely have<br />\neliminated Hopkins from consideration. \"We knew that if we<br />\nlost we had no chance at all,\"<br />\nsaid senior Joel Siepierski.<br />\nWashington had entered the game<br />\nwith a 20-3 record, with two of<br />\ntheir three losses coming to Division I schools. They were 9-0 in<br />\nthe MAC Southeast Division and<br />\nranked 15th in the country. But<br />\nthis record was not at all intimidating to the Jays, who<br />\nresponded with their best game of<br />\nthe season. \"There was no<br />\nmotivation on my part,\" said<br />\nNelson. \"They knew what was at<br />\nstake.

This marked the 20th consecutive conference championship won by the Jays, first with<br />\nthe MAC and now with the<br />\nUAA. As Kennedy stated in the<br />\nfirst Wednesday night team<br />\nmeeting. Hopkins can now say<br />\nthat it has had a \"generation of<br />\nexcellence\" with men's team<br />\nswimming.

Part<br /><br />\nFencers host UAA's<br />\nSaturday and Sunday<br /><br />\nof this can be attributed to the<br />\nnumber of Division I teams<br />\nagainst which they compete, part<br />\nto injury, and part to chance. But<br />\nexcuses aside, the Hopkins swimmers redeemed themselves this<br />\npast weekend, and as Coach Kennedy mentioned, \"when someone<br />\nasks me how our season went, I<br />\ndon't tell them who won or lost<br />\neach dual meet... I tell them how<br />\nwe did at the Conference and Na-<br /><br />\nVictories over conference foes<br />\nSUNY-Purchase and Vassar last<br />\nSaturday marked the end of the<br />\nregular season for the men's fencing team.

The Jays<br />\nnow begin the postseason by<br />\nhosting the UAA Championships<br />\nthis weekend.<br /><br />\nThe fencers started off slowly<br />\nagainst host SUNY-Purchase, but<br />\nwon handily 16-11(14-8).
