(This<br />\nmiddle-Beethoven work derives its<br />\ntitle from one Count Waldstein,<br />\nBeethoven's principal benefactor<br />\nduring his first years in Vienna.)<br />\nI became especially entranced<br />\nby Lupu's intricate treatment of<br />\nthe \"Rondo's\" dynamic treble<br />\narpeggios. Equally exciting was the<br />\ntumultuous bass clef which could<br />\nnot but integrate the audience in<br />\nfurious delight. Another high point<br />\nwas \"No. 1 in C Minor\" one of the<br />\n\"Four Imprompus.\" Lupu truly<br />\ndemonstrated musical brilliance<br />\nwith his superb treatment of the<br />\nrigorous concord proposed by this<br />\npeice. I could not help but to<br />\nbecome enraptured by his deft<br />\nsweeping of the Steinway's ivory.<br />\nThe entire concert included<br />\nHaydn's \"Variations in F Minor,\"<br />\nthe \"Waldstein\" piece, consisting<br />\nof \"Allegro con brio,\"<br />\n\"Intraduzione: Molto adagio,\" and<br />\n\"Rondo.\" Following a brief<br />\nintermission, Lupu preformed<br />\nSchubert's \"Four Impromptus,<br />\nOpus 90\" and his \"Sonata in A<br />\nMinor, Opus 143.\" Lupu's two<br />\nencores consisted of Brahms'<br />\n\"Barcarrole in A-flat Minor\" and<br />\n<br />\nanother Schubert composition.<br />\nin Bucharest. February, 1972,<br />\nLupu has enjoyed a uniquely brought Lupu's musical debut in<br />\nstellar position in music since he the United States, as he appeared<br />\nbegan the study of piano at age with the Cleveland Orchestra under<br />\nsix: his first professional debut Maria Giulina. Since then he has<br />\noccured six years later.

William Mann of the<br />\nMuzicescu. After securing a Times of London thought Lupu's<br />\nscholarship to the Moscow intensity \"an unbroken joy, grand,<br />\nConservatoire at age seventeen, he poetic, a vivid almost spectacular<br />\nstudied under Heinrich Neuhaus drama.\" Benjamin Har-Am<br />\nand his son Stanislay.<br />\nbelieved Lupu a \"revelation'<br />\nAs if to enforce these impressive (whose) tremendous energy and<br />\ncredentials, Lupu won the United musicality held the audience<br />\nStates' Van Cliburn Competition in spellbound.\"<br />\n.<br />\nThe board of Directors of the<br />\n1966, the Leeds International<br />\nConcert Series has perenially<br />\nCompetition in Great Britain one<br />\navailed Epicurean diversion<br />\nyear later and in 1970, the Georges<br />\nunorthodox in its excellence.

Learning I am told,<br />\nactually transpires at the Faculty<br />\nand Graduate level of our alma<br />\nmater, but what of the<br />\nlowly<br />\nundergraduate? Knowledge seems<br />\nto take a back seat to grades. The<br />\nprocess of learning becomes a<br />\ntrivial matter in the minds of most<br />\nundergraduates here. Its the grades<br />\nthat are important.

They<br />\ntake Test Scores and CPAs and put<br />\nthem into a computer to come up<br />\nwith their entering class. This<br />\nattitude has reflected itself at the<br />\nUndergraduate level. The<br />\ncompetition for grades has become<br />\nintense.

Americans, young and old, will once again be called<br />\nto rally 'round the flagpole.<br />\nThis weekend's demonstration topic is to delve into the<br />\nquestion of presidential impeachment<br />\nIn the latest counterculture tradition of civil disovedience<br />\nand oral, physical expression which has emerged from the radical 60's, the generation that brought you the Peace March,<br />\nsit-ins, college administration take-overs is again sponsoring<br />\nanother in the continuing series of polical rallies.<br />\nThough it's disturbing to generally lump the average American into the \"silent majority\" category, thereby arbitrarily<br />\nrelegating him to the backseat of the all-American mid-size<br />\ncar, it serves as little consolation to swing to the other side of<br />\nthe conscience pendulum and view John Doe as a Washington<br />\nMonument groupie.<br />\nThe question of the public acceptance of Presidential credibility in defending his cause alon g the lines (and to the tune)<br />\nof \"I am not a crook\", is very much a matter of personal<br />\njudgement and one dares not to tamper with the free conscious of an American in deliberating the opinion on any issue of such profound relevance.<br />\nHowever, such massive, \"simultaneous\" actions of political<br />\nconscious-raising such as demonstrations on the scale of hundreds of thousands, lend readily to the characterizat ion of<br />\nAmericans as a nation of sheep.<br />\nWhile the political deeds of the Watergate era have been<br />\nperilously frightening, it's also somewhat frightening, on the<br />\nother hand, to speculate that the political consciousness of an<br />\naverage American might be led along the line of reason in the<br />\nname of group solidarity and righteousness.<br />\nHopefully those going to the three major cities to express<br />\ntheir affirmative views on impeachment are going with a pre-formulated and well-thought out position on this issue of<br />\nprime national attention. All others who might be perhaps<br />\ntagging along on the coattails of \"a friend\", or longing for<br />\nassociation with those drawing attention, would otherwise,<br />\nwith respect to any sincerity on the part of the other demonstrators, do best to stay home.<br /><br />\nRadu Lapu: The grand finale to Shriver Concert Series<br />\nBy J. McERLEAN<br />\nIt is too seldom that an artist of<br />\nconsiderable note penetrates the<br />\ncultural wilderness here at Johns<br />\nHopkins. Such musical expertise<br />\nwas contributed by Radu Lupu,<br />\nwho enticed classical aficionados<br />\nwith his elegant pianistry and<br />\nbrought this year's Shriver Hall<br />\nConcert Series to a memorable<br />\nclose this past Sunday night.<br />\nLup, an artist of quintessential<br />\naptitude, performed a<br />\nfinely-balanced selection of Haydn,<br />\nBeethoven, and Schubert, and<br />\nconcluded with encores of Brahms<br />\nand Schubert. Only with extreme<br />\ndifficulty could one mark a<br />\nhighlight in Sunday's performance.<br />\nHowever, my own preference - and<br />\nthat of many - was Lupu's<br />\ninterpretation of Beethoven's<br />\n\"Rondo: Allegretto moderato Prestissimo,\" part of the Sonata in<br />\nC Major, Opus 53, the \"Waldstein\"<br />\npiece composed in 1804. (This<br />\nmiddle-Beethoven work derives its<br />\ntitle from one Count Waldstein,<br />\nBeethoven's principal benefactor<br />\nduring his first years in Vienna.)<br />\nI became especially entranced<br />\nby Lupu's intricate treatment of<br />\nthe \"Rondo's\" dynamic treble<br />\narpeggios. Equally exciting was the<br />\ntumultuous bass clef which could<br />\nnot but integrate the audience in<br />\nfurious delight. Another high point<br />\nwas \"No. 1 in C Minor\" one of the<br />\n\"Four Imprompus.\" Lupu truly<br />\ndemonstrated musical brilliance<br />\nwith his superb treatment of the<br />\nrigorous concord proposed by this<br />\npeice. I could not help but to<br />\nbecome enraptured by his deft<br />\nsweeping of the Steinway's ivory.<br />\nThe entire concert included<br />\nHaydn's \"Variations in F Minor,\"<br />\nthe \"Waldstein\" piece, consisting<br />\nof \"Allegro con brio,\"<br />\n\"Intraduzione: Molto adagio,\" and<br />\n\"Rondo.\" Following a brief<br />\nintermission, Lupu preformed<br />\nSchubert's \"Four Impromptus,<br />\nOpus 90\" and his \"Sonata in A<br />\nMinor, Opus 143.\" Lupu's two<br />\nencores consisted of Brahms'<br />\n\"Barcarrole in A-flat Minor\" and<br /><br />\nanother Schubert composition.<br />\nin Bucharest. February, 1972,<br />\nLupu has enjoyed a uniquely brought Lupu's musical debut in<br />\nstellar position in music since he the United States, as he appeared<br />\nbegan the study of piano at age with the Cleveland Orchestra under<br />\nsix: his first professional debut Maria Giulina. Since then he has<br />\noccured six years later. For several performed at the majority of<br />\nyears he profitted from such notable European Festivals and<br />\ndefinitive mentors as Cella with major orchestras in the<br />\nDelavrancea and Professor Florica United States. William Mann of the<br />\nMuzicescu. After securing a Times of London thought Lupu's<br />\nscholarship to the Moscow intensity \"an unbroken joy, grand,<br />\nConservatoire at age seventeen, he poetic, a vivid almost spectacular<br />\nstudied under Heinrich Neuhaus drama.\" Benjamin Har-Am<br />\nand his son Stanislay.<br />\nbelieved Lupu a \"revelation'<br />\nAs if to enforce these impressive (whose) tremendous energy and<br />\ncredentials, Lupu won the United musicality held the audience<br />\nStates' Van Cliburn Competition in spellbound.\"<br />\n.<br />\nThe board of Directors of the<br />\n1966, the Leeds International<br />\nConcert Series has perenially<br />\nCompetition in Great Britain one<br />\navailed Epicurean diversion<br />\nyear later and in 1970, the Georges<br />\nunorthodox in its excellence.

For the undergraduate,<br />\nthe atmosphere is distinctly<br />\nunintellectual. Learning I am told,<br />\nactually transpires at the Faculty<br />\nand Graduate level of our alma<br />\nmater, but what of the<br />\nlowly<br />\nundergraduate? Knowledge seems<br />\nto take a back seat to grades. The<br />\nprocess of learning becomes a<br />\ntrivial matter in the minds of most<br />\nundergraduates here. Its the grades<br />\nthat are important. Can't get in to<br />\nlaw school without the grades. \"We<br />\ncould fill our med school with all<br />\n4.0 averages if we wanted to,\" says<br />\nthe Med school admissions officers.<br />\nGotta get those grades.<br />\nOf course, some learning, some<br />\neducating, does go on at the<br />\nundergraduute level hut<br />\nunfortunately this occurs by<br />\nosmosis.

I<br />\ndon't do any work except the<br />\nnight before exams. Then I might<br />\nlook at the book for an hour.\"<br />\nThis guy never ceases to amaze<br />\nme. He also has an interesting<br />\nphilosophy when it comes to<br />\nchosing the next semester's<br />\ncourses.<br />\n\"Hey man, what are you<br />\ntaking?\" says the aforementioned<br />\n'pre-med.

When I<br />\n.think about it, I can't decide who<br />\nis in worse shape: the guy with the<br />\n\"dream schedule,\" or the guy who<br />\nlives in fear of the B++. They are<br />\nboth getting the type of education<br />\nthey deserve.<br />\nSuicidal Tendencies ...When I came to Hopkins I was<br />\nunder the extreme misimpression<br />\nthat the object was to learn<br />\nsomething in four years. Not only<br />\nwas one to be exposed to unknown<br />\nacademic disciplines but by the<br />\nend of the trip a knack for<br />\nthinking was to have been<br />\nacquired. I looked forward to the long hot afternoons spent in<br />\nheated discussion with professors<br />\naid<br />\nfoun6 the<br />\nprofessors(for the most part) to be<br />\nwilling to indulge in this type of<br />\nfrivilous activity. My collegues<br />\nwere always too busy studying for<br />\nthe next exam.<br />\nLast semester I toyed with the<br />\nde a of pushing for unlimited<br />\npass/fail. That is, a student could<br />\nzake as many P/F courses as he<br />\nwanted. I thought that this<br />\ndeemphasis of grades might help<br />\nget us back on the right track.'<br />\nWhen put to a student poll it failed<br />\nmiserably. Why did this happen?<br /><br />\nctmcemed<br /><br />\nvvi<br /><br />\nwhat a<br /><br />\nsITSdell<br /><br />\nknows or his ability to think. They<br />\ntake Test Scores and CPAs and put<br />\nthem into a computer to come up<br />\nwith their entering class. This<br />\nattitude has reflected itself at the<br />\nUndergraduate level. The<br />\ncompetition for grades has become<br />\nintense. GPAs have gone up 20% in<br />\nthe last four years at Hopkins.<br />\nHow does a pre-med in the class of<br />\n1975 feel when he finds that his<br />\n3.35 GPA gives him a class rank of<br />\n200 in a class of 500? How does he<br />\nfeel when he can't get in to med<br />\nschool with his \"mediocore\" 3.4?<br />\nEducation<br />\nThe obvious solution to this<br />\nproblem is for American<br />\ninstitutions of higher learning to<br />\nreturn to the practice of<br />\nemphasizing thinking. Hopkins is<br />\nsupposedly one of thes<br />\ninstitutions. The facilities are<br />\nadequate, the faculty is great and<br />\nthe students have potential. Let us<br />\nbegin here.<br />\nAnd how do we embark on this<br />\nventuresome journey? We do it as<br />\nindividuals. Each of us decides that<br />\nknowledge is ultimately what we<br />\nare after and that we're just<br />\nwasting time here if that isn't our<br />\ngoal. Do I expect this to happen?<br />\nOf course not. But if<br />\nundergraduates here don't start<br />\nthinking about this and readjusting<br />\ntheir priorities then I fear for the<br />\nfuture of Hopkins and higher<br />\nEducation in America.<br />\n774<br />\n,<br />\n15-SZIR<br />\n, ,\"'<br />\nDtPrtgRRYXV/0<br /><br />\n1181:e1.<br /><br />\nrights of all its citizens.

This is far<br />\nfrom the time needed to write<br />\ncampaign literature and to have<br />\ncopies made.

He allowed four<br />\nruns, three of which were earned,<br />\non five hits, striking out two and<br />\nwalking two in the three and<br />\ntwo-thirds innings he pitched.<br />\nBill Evans came on in the fourth<br />\nto stifle a Western Maryland<br />\nralley and close off the offense<br />\nfor the visitors.<br />\nWestern Maryland broke on<br />\ntop early with a run in the third<br />\nas a result of a four base error by<br />\nBob Babb. They rallied in the<br />\nthird for three runs on four<br />\nconsecutive hits to close off their<br />\nscoring. Hopkins lone run came<br />\nin the fourth as Billy Jones<br />\ntripled to right and scored on a<br />\nthrowing error by the third<br />\nbaseman on the relay from right<br />\nfield.<br />\nScare<br />\nPhil Burlington was the losing<br />\npitcher for the Jays giving up five<br />\nruns, only one of which was<br />\nearned, in his six inning stint.<br />\nHopkins picked up a run in the<br />\nfourth and the ninth innings<br />\nmaking the final score 7-2.<br />\nTo finish up the week on a<br />\nhigh note, Billy Jones and the<br />\nJays stormed off their loss to<br />\nWidener by clipping the Bears of<br />\n\u2022 Ursinus by the score of 5-3 giving<br />\nthe Jays their second league<br />\nvictory in four starts raising their<br />\nrecord to 4-8 overall.<br />\nHopkins opened with a<br />\nhomerun by Jack Bukowski<br />\nBukowski doubled another run<br />\nhome in the fourth making him<br />\nthe offensive star of the game.<br />\nJones nearly shut out Ursinus but<br />\nthey came up with three in the<br />\nbottom of the ninth to avoid the<br />\nblank.<br /><br />\nthrough almost three periods<br />\nbefore running out of gas in the<br />\nfinal stanza. For the fourth game<br />\nin a row Hopkins was outshot,<br />\nthis time 55-46, but the Blue<br />\nJays made up with accuracy what<br />\nthey lacked in volume. In shots<br />\non goal, Hopkins prevailed 34-23.<br />\nOften the Bruins missed the net<br />\nby as much as two yards, even<br />\nfrom in close.<br />\nOne of the bright spots in the<br />\nafternoon was the revival of the<br />\nBlue Jay extra man unit. After<br />\nbeing shut out by Rutgers, the<br />\nHopkins power play converted<br />\nthe first three chances and<br />\nfinished with five goals in eight<br />\ntries.<br />\nBrown took the early lead<br />\nninety seconds into the contest<br />\non a power play goal of their<br />\nown. Five minutes before Billy<br />\nNolan knotted the score on an<br />\nextra man pass from Rick<br />\nKowalchuk. Scooping up the<br />\nensuing face off, Kowalchuk<br />\nbounced a shot by goalie Dan<br />\nCampbell to give Hopkins the<br />\nlead for good with 8:04 on the<br />\nclock.<br />\nA strong dodge by Thomas set<br />\nup the next goal as he broke free<br />\nat the crease but passed off to<br />\nWittelsberger, who had an even<br />\nbetter shot at the goal. The pair<br />\nwas responsible for the next six<br />\nBlue goals in a twenty minute<br />\nspan that saw Brown score four<br />\ntimes. Highlighting the Hopkins<br />\ntallies was a Wittelsberger one<br />\nhanded shot taken while the<br />\nsophomore was flat on his back<br />\nin front of the goal. That came<br />\non a Thomas rebound.<br />\nDale Kohler opened the third<br />\nperiod scoring with his personal<br />\nfavorite, the front swing from<br />\nbehind, for his first of two goals.<br />\nHopkins kept pressuring the<br />\nBruins defense but Campbell<br />\nproved tough to beat. Once he<br />\nput together four fabulous moves<br />\nfrom point blank range to deny<br />\nThomas. Kowalchuk,<br />\nWittelsberger, and Jim Cahill<br />\nwithin a matter of fifteen<br />\nseconds.<br />\nBob Rubeor put the next<br />\nmarker on the board for Brown<br /><br />\nDownie Slafkosky pulls down<br />\nan errant Brown pass<br />\nwith 3:30 remaining in the third<br />\nquarter with a shot at the crease.<br />\nMaking the score 10-6 at the<br />\ntime, that turned out to be the<br />\nlast gasp for the defending Ivy<br />\nLeague champs. Hopkins<br />\nproceeded to reel off nine<br />\nunanswered goals before the<br />\nBruins bounced a power play<br />\nshot into the Blue Jay net.<br />\nFreshman Tom Myrick opened<br />\nthe spurt with his tenth NCAA<br />\ngoal as the third period ended.<br />\nAfter Thomas tallied twice to<br />\nbegin the final stanza, Mike Perez<br />\nput in a pair and Phil Calderone,<br />\nPaul Edwards, Larry Leonard,<br />\nRick Kramer. and Randy Dase all<br />\nadded single shots.<br />\nOne of the developments had<br />\nHopkins put Thomas and<br />\nWittelsberger on the crease<br />\ntogether, where they can play off<br />\neach other's picks to take feeds<br />\nfrom freshman Richie Hirsch<br />\nbehind. Such plays resulted in<br />\nthree Blue Jay goals and should<br />\nprove effective in the future.<br />\nAlso noteworthy was the<br />\ncontinuing ground ball play of<br />\nDownie Slafkosky. Often he was<br />\nin the right spot for key ground<br />\nballs, which has been typical of<br />\nhis play all season.<br /><br />\nsports briefs<br />\nWater Polo Joins NCAA<br />\nA new team has joined the<br />\nrealm of intercollegiate athletics<br />\nat Hopkins.
