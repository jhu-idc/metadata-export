DiLeo's resignation was<br />\nprompted by a threat of impeachment from the Student Council on<br />\nthe grounds that DiLeo missed<br />\ntoo many meetings. FitzGerald<br />\nnoted that this instance was the<br />\nfirst effective use of the Council's<br />\nattendance policy.<br />\nThe Council next discussed the<br />\nSAC seals that accompany<br />\ngraduates' degrees. Each year,<br />\nstudents nominate those seniors<br />\nwho they think have made a<br />\nsignficant contribution to the<br />\nHopkins community. Nominations are made by submitting<br />\nnames to the Student Activities<br />\nOffice, where the selection process takes place.

Lee Davis<br />\n<br />\nNot a Good Year for Nat Sci<br />\nAcademic adviser James Goodyear provided the News-Letter with an article this<br />\nweek which discusses the new requirements<br />\nfor the Natural Sciences area major.<br />\nGoodyear stresses that, because the new requirements make the major more difficult<br />\nto complete, it is important for science majors to plan their four-year schedule in<br />\nadvance.<br />\nHe's not kidding. The new requirements<br />\nfor the major make it as difficult to complete as the department science majors, requiring more upper-level science courses<br />\nthan were previously necessary. That's<br />\nfine\u2014after all, a major in the sciences<br />\nshould mean that the majority of courses<br />\ntaken are science courses. But<br />\nwait. . .there's more!<br />\nNatural science and biology majors (the<br />\nmajority of whom are premeds) take<br />\nMolecular Cell Biology(MCB)as their first<br />\nbiology course. Since this course requires<br />\nIntroductory and Organic Chemistry as<br />\nprerequisites, MCB is traditionally taken<br />\nduring the spring of sophomore and junior<br />\nyears. During this second semester, most<br />\nstudents then take the first oftwo semesters<br />\nof General Physics. Short of loading up on<br />\ntop of these classes, the students are leftwith three semesters to complete their<br />\nupper-level science courses. Until now, this<br />\nhas not been such a bad thing, since two<br />\nsemesters of MCB fulfilled eight of the 15<br />\nupper-level courses needed.<br />\nAccording to the changes, however,<br />\nMCB no longer fulfills upper-level science<br />\ncredit, even though it is a rigorous,<br />\n300-level course. And because it is a prere-<br />\n<br />\nquisite for all other upper-level biologyrelated courses, the average natural<br />\nsciences student will not begin to fulfill<br />\nupper-level coursework until the second<br />\nsemester of their junior year. This results<br />\nin heavy courseloads all through junior and<br />\nsenior year\u2014the time during which many<br />\nstudents would prefer to concentrate on<br />\nMCAT review and medical school<br />\napplications.<br />\nThe MCAT brings up another point. The<br />\npremed schedule leaves students grotesquely unprepared for the biology portion of the<br />\nMCAT. Much of this test deals with<br />\nphysiology and some genetics\u2014topics<br />\nwhich are not covered by MCB. There is<br />\nno introductory level biology course required of the science majors. The<br />\nbiophysics department offer a physiology<br />\ncourse every two years, so the student who<br />\nplans wisely can anticipate this class. The<br />\nclass is one lecture taught at both the 100and 300- levels. While the 100-level course<br />\nis fine for non-science majors, it fulfills no<br />\nrequirement for the science major. The<br />\n300-level course does, but\u2014surprise\u2014it has<br />\nMCB as a prerequisite!<br />\nThe natural sciences major is thus no<br />\nbargain. Students who want plenty of<br />\nscience may as well enjoy the benefits of<br />\nthe departmental programs. Those who<br />\nwant only to prepare for medical school<br />\nshould follow Goodyear's advice and look<br />\noutside of the sciences for majors. This<br />\nalternative may the best one yet, since it<br />\nallows premeds to fulfill medical school requirements while concentrating in other<br />\nfields entirely.<br />\n<br />\nMlbe Party'<br />\nThere was a headline that ran a tew years<br />\nago in this newspaper for a 'spring fair update' article which read \"Spring Fair: No<br />\nConcert; No 10K Run.\" It's a dangerous<br />\nprecedent to start commenting on the work<br />\nof previous News-Letter staffs\u2014surely it<br />\ncan only come back to haunt us\u2014but the<br />\nsentiment behind the headline misses an important point.<br />\nSpring Fair is a celebration of the season,<br />\nbut really it celebrates Hopkins and its<br />\nstudents. Student organization and participation creates activities and infuses a<br />\nvitality which makes Fair far more than<br />\nsimply an arts and crafts showcase; we<br />\nopen the doors of our campus to Baltimore<br />\nand beyond for a three day festival.<br />\nAdmittedly, the lack of a concert and a<br />\n10k run were regrettable shortcomings that<br />\nyear. This should not have supplanted the<br />\noverwhelmingly positive nature of the Fair.<br />\nLooking at this year's Fair, it has all of<br />\nwhat we've come to expect and more. The<br />\n<br />\ntellenb<br />\n<br />\nconcert is featuring The BoDeans, one of<br />\nAmericas hottest new bands. There will indeed be a road race again, along with performances by other bands, student and professional, fair games, a car show, and<br />\nChester Wickwire's dog show. Corresponding to the liberty theme, the Old Guard<br />\nFife and Drum Corps will perfor. Our tricornered hats go off to the chairmen who<br />\ncreatively and diligently worked to make<br />\nthe fair better than ever.<br />\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when<br />\npeople would look to Fair and say: \"This<br />\nis the one thing that Hopkins does right.\"<br />\nIt would be a mistake, looking at other successful social ventures such as Hoppy<br />\nHour, or the recent FIJI Islander, to say this<br />\nis still true. Nevertheless, Spring Fair remains Hopkins students' largest<br />\nendeavor\u2014achieving consistently successful results. With this year promising to<br />\nbe no exception, we hope everyone can<br />\nhave a blast this weekend.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, I was embroiled in a little debate with one<br />\nof my G.W. Whiting School<br />\nfriends. He held that spoken and<br />\nwritten languages should be done<br />\naway with, that they are inefficient and confusing at best,<br />\nand\u2014because of the possibility<br />\nthat certain situations could be<br />\nmisconstrued\u2014dangerous at<br />\nworst. The only way, the best<br />\nway, according to my friend, to<br />\ncommunicate is with mathematical symbols and equations. Of<br />\ncourse, there is beauty in a wellturned phrase, he said, but there<br />\nis just as much elegance in a<br />\nlogical proof, or a wellformulated equation. Newton's<br />\nlaws and Maxwell's equations<br />\ndon't just give us a slice of life,<br />\nas most litereature does; but<br />\nrather, they describe, encompass,<br />\nin a sense, life itself. They are the<br />\npith, the essential element of<br />\nhuman knowledge. After equations, literature is a johnny-comelately, excess baggage we've accumulated over the years.<br />\nTechnology has now allowed us<br />\nto do away with it if we so<br />\nchoose.<br />\nHe was originally from India,<br />\nand lamented how much confusion was caused by the language<br />\nbarrier. If everyone put their<br />\nideas across in numbers, without<br />\nnuances<br />\npotential<br />\nor<br />\nmisunderstanding, the world<br />\nwould be a better place. Foreign<br />\nrelations would be cut and dried.<br />\nI rose to the defense of my<br />\ncraft. Sure, I said, you could<br />\ncommunicate quite well with<br />\nequations, but the intelligent mind<br />\neschews routine. If one and only<br />\n<br />\none equation equalled one idea<br />\n(the expected conclusion of his<br />\nreductionism), so-called \"communication\" would be stilted indeed. How could one communicate feelings\u2014the joy of<br />\nreceiving an acceptance into college, the disbelieving horror<br />\nwhich follows a car accident\u2014<br />\nwith equations? Would one just<br />\nstate the equation which translates<br />\nto \"I am happy,\" or \"I am<br />\nscared\"? Somehow, the true state<br />\nof mind doesn't come across, and<br />\nin that sense, communicating by<br />\nnumbers would be less accurate.<br />\nIf all he were concerned about<br />\nwas having a universal language,<br />\nI urged him to join an Esperanto<br />\nlobby group.<br />\n\"Next time you're having a<br />\nproblem getting an idea across,<br />\nremember what I said,\" he concluded. I considered his project in<br />\ndepth. Without double-speak and<br />\npseudo-speak, politicians and<br />\nlawyers would be out of business.<br />\nWithout the hook of \"you may<br />\nwon,\"<br />\nhave<br />\njunk-mail<br />\nsweepstakes would process their<br />\nlast mailing list. Without words<br />\nof the Word, nothing would flow<br />\nfrom our friendly neighborhood<br />\ntelevangelists. Suddenly, it didn't<br />\nseem like such a bad idea.<br />\nI thought of how much money<br />\ncould be saved by schools across<br />\nthe nation. They could cut out<br />\nEnglish and social studies classes<br />\nand have those teachers cook<br />\nsome real food for the kids. The<br />\nSAT and GRE scores would only be out of 800. I wouldn't have<br />\nto hear \"Best of Baltimore.\" You<br />\nwouldn't have to read this column.

Presently I am majoring in both Electrical/Computer<br />\nEngineering and Writing<br />\nSeminars, and although I plan to<br />\ncontinue writing, the EE program<br />\n,just has to go.<br />\nI am still a practical person. I<br />\nrealize that Writing Seminars will<br />\nnot likely lead me to a job with<br />\ngreat pay or much prestige, so I<br />\nintend to maintain a double with<br />\nsome other major. Many people<br />\nconsider Writing Seminars an<br />\n\"easy degree,\" and it can be, but<br />\nit's more what the individual<br />\nchooses to make of it. Certain<br />\ndepartments at Hopkins have very<br />\nflexible requirements, and<br />\nalthough this has its merits, I<br />\nbelieve people can graduate with<br />\na Writing Seminars degree with<br />\nlittle effort and little learned, but<br />\nit doesn't have to be that way.<br />\nBut I come here not to praise<br />\nEngineering, but to bury him.<br />\nCertainly, part of the problem is<br />\nme. I seem to be very good at<br />\nwhatever it is that we engineersin-training are supposed to learn,<br />\nbut I'm not really interested in the<br />\nwork, and as such, I tend to be<br />\nrather sloppy about it. This is no<br />\nway to go about a career.<br />\nBut part of the problem is the<br />\nfaculty and the organization of the<br />\nschool. Every single professor involved in the engineering department has either displayed a blatant disinterest in undergraduates<br />\n<br />\nnities since the early 1980s,(vis.,<br />\nexcessive drinking, pledge hazing, and female abuse). Burcham<br />\nagrees that these problems do exist at some universities and that<br />\nthe problems should be publicized. However, she contends that<br />\nthe publication of such Greek<br />\ncriticism \"without running a corresponding article which<br />\ndiscusses the benefits and positive<br />\naspects of fraternity behavior is<br />\nnot only misleading but also unfair,\" especially to Hopkins<br />\nfraternities and sororities. When<br />\nconsidering Burcham's argument, one might wish to visualize<br />\nWoodward and Bernstein<br />\nfeverishly working to write a<br />\npositive article on the Nixon Administration so that it could run<br />\nnext to their latest unflattering<br />\npiece on the Watergate affair.<br />\nIn the name of \"fairplay,\"<br />\nshould the News-Letter publish an<br />\n\"anti-Greek\" article everytime it<br />\nreports on a positive aspect of the<br />\nGreek system? If all News-Letter<br />\narticles which expressed an opinion on any subject had to be accompanied by an article with the<br />\nopposing view(s), the NewsLetter would be sixty pages thick<br />\nand would appear monthly. Burcham's absurdly impractical<br />\nargument for equal coverage<br />\nnecessitates<br />\nno<br />\nfurther<br />\nbelaboring.<br />\nBurcham also claims that the<br />\narticle in question presents a<br />\ndisturbing and inaccurate picture<br />\nof Hopkins fraternities to faculty, administration, et al. This<br />\n<br />\nor at least, total ignorance of the<br />\nrest of the school.<br />\nWhen I first spoke to my<br />\nengineering advisor, I asked him<br />\nabout math placement. Not only<br />\ncould he tell me nothing about the<br />\nrequirements<br />\nmathematics<br />\nbeyond the credits enumerated in<br />\nthe curricula guide, but he was<br />\nhard pressed to tell me in which<br />\nbuilding I might find the math<br />\ndepartment to ask someone. One<br />\nwould think that when the success<br />\nof engineering students is<br />\nnecessarily based on their<br />\nmathematial background, the<br />\nengineering faculty would show<br />\nmore interest.<br />\nFormer Writing Seminars<br />\nundergraduate advisor Robert<br />\nArellano was so well loved<br />\nbecause of the individual attention<br />\nsingle<br />\nevery<br />\nhe<br />\ngave<br />\nundergraduate with which he was<br />\nconcerned. He remembered each<br />\none personally. If we could expect half of that devotion to the<br />\nundergraduate engineering<br />\nstudents by faculty, the department would be all the better. Dr.<br />\nBob was a fantastic advisor, but<br />\nhe was not necessarily atypical of<br />\nHopkins.

First,<br />\nseeing that the referenced article<br />\ndoes not in any way indict, or<br />\neven mention, Hopkins fraternities, any disfavorable opinions<br />\nformed by the faculty and administration from reading the article must find their basis in<br />\ndisturbing events that have occurred at Hopkins parallel to those<br />\ncited in the article. It follows,<br />\nthen that if the article is inaccurate in its applicability to the<br />\nHopkins Greek system, neither<br />\nfaculty nor administration will<br />\nconjure up a disturbing picture of<br />\nHopkins fraternities. Does the article accurately depict some of the<br />\nproblems which the Hopkins<br />\nGreek system has recently encountered? Perhaps. Perhaps not.<br />\nWithin the last few weeks two<br />\nHopkins fraternities have been<br />\ndisciplined by their national<br />\norganizations, one for female<br />\nabuse.<br />\nThe article does not claim to be<br />\nan accurate representation of the<br />\nbehavior of all fraternities nationwide, but only seeks to present an<br />\noverview of some of the recent<br />\nproblems arising from Greek<br />\n\"misbehavior.\"<br />\nThe purpose of my letter is not<br />\nto disparage fraternities in<br />\ngeneral, nor the Hopkins Greek<br />\nsystem in particular, but rather to<br />\ntake exception with Burcham's<br />\nposition that the April 1st issue<br />\narticle dealing with Greek<br />\nmisdeeds is an unfair and inaccurate depiction of Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nblue physics type or are quite<br />\nsatisfied with biology, this state<br />\nof affairs is no big deal. But if you<br />\nare still shopping around for your<br />\nacademic niche or if you might le<br />\nconsidering graduating a semester<br />\nearly, then be aware that the new<br />\nrequirements for the natural<br />\nsciences area major have changed and have become quite<br />\ndemanding.<br />\nFor some time, faculty in the<br />\nnatural sciences departments<br />\nwere concerned that this area major was not sufficiently rigorous.<br />\nThey felt that the requirement of<br />\n\"at least 40 credits for courses<br />\ncoded (N), to include at least one<br />\nyear of chemistry with laboratory<br />\nand one year of physics with<br />\nlaboratory, and a minimum of 15<br />\n(N)credits for study at or beyond<br />\nthe 300 level, not including<br />\nresearch, internships or independent study credits\" was both too<br />\nmodest and too easy to<br />\nmanipulate. And they were right,<br />\npartly because the guidelines did<br />\nnot exclude 300-level labs from<br />\nmeeting requirements and partly because Hopkins does not offer a year-long introductory<br />\nbiology course with lab. So,<br />\nthrough this year, a student who<br />\nfulfilled medical school prerequisites of a year of biology and<br />\nlab could count both semesters of<br />\nmolecular cell biology and lab\u2014a<br />\ntotal of 12-14 credits\u2014toward the<br />\n15 (N) credits at or beyond the<br />\n300 level required for the natural<br />\nsciences area.<br />\nWhether or not this meant the<br />\nnatural sciences area major was<br />\ntoo \"easy\" and called for<br />\n\"toughening up\" is debatable.<br />\nPerhaps what was needed was<br />\n<br />\ncloser faculty advising to insure<br />\nthat students maintained rigorous<br />\nprograms. Or maybe the addition<br />\nto the curriculum of a biology<br />\ncourse akin to introductory<br />\nchemistry or physics would have<br />\nsufficiently strengthened the major. These are moot points,<br />\nbecause the requirements were<br />\nchanged to the following:<br />\n(I)One year of introductory<br />\nchemistry<br />\nplus<br />\nlab.<br />\nOne year of general physics plus<br />\nlab.<br />\nOne<br />\nyear<br />\nof calculus.<br />\n(2)20 credits of introductory<br />\nand/or upper-level science and<br />\nmathematics.<br />\n(Premedical<br />\nstudents would normally take one<br />\nyear of organic chemistry with<br />\nlab and one year of biology with<br />\nlab.)<br />\n(3)Five one-semester courses at<br />\nthe 300 level (totalling at least 15<br />\ncredits). These can be divided at<br />\nmost between two departments.<br />\nThree of the courses must be in<br />\neither biology, chemistr)<br />\nphysics, biophysics, or earth and<br />\nplanetary sciences. However, no<br />\ncourses used to satisfy requirement(2)can be used to fulfill this<br />\nrequirement. Also, no labs, independent study, research, or<br />\ntutorials can count toward upperlevel science courses.<br />\n(4)A minimum of 30 H/S credits<br />\nto include at least five courses at<br />\nor beyond the 300 level. These<br />\n300-level courses have to total at<br />\nleast 15 credits and can be taken<br />\nin, at most, three different departments. The 300-level courses<br />\nmay be taken P/F but cannot include independent study,<br />\nSee CURRICULUM, 11<br />\n<br />\n\f10TAPRIL 15, 1988<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nLETTERS, from 9<br />\nthe Hopkins community may<br />\nhave found the article interesting,<br />\nit is in no way indicative of the<br />\nGreek System at JHU. For example, Bow uoin College President<br />\nA. LeRoy Greason chose to<br />\ndescribe fraternities today as<br />\n\"social centers without any very<br />\nclear purpose.\" While this sadly<br />\nmay be the case at his institution,<br />\nthe first sentence in this<br />\nparagraph clearly shows he is<br />\nlacking the benefit of a broad<br />\nperspective.<br />\nThe fraternity and sorority<br />\nmembers at Hopkins participate<br />\nin many activities, the overwhelming majority of which<br />\nbenefit the Hopkins community<br />\nand the neighborhoods of<br />\nBaltimore. But it is only when we<br />\nscrew up that the press chooses to<br />\nrecognize us at all. The unfortunate incident at TEP and those<br />\nexamples cited in the past two<br />\nNews-Letters are prime examples<br />\nof this. If fraternities make such<br />\ninteresting news, why are there<br />\nnot articles about our volunteer<br />\nwork for charities or the Dean of<br />\nStudents-sponsored, educational<br />\nprograms run by the IFC? The<br />\nNews-Letter consistently ignores<br />\nthe progress made by the IFC in<br />\neducating and policing its<br />\nmembership. I doubt that there<br />\nare any student groups on this<br />\ncampus who seek to educate and<br />\ntake responsibility for the actions<br />\nof their members as diligently as<br />\nthe IFC. I am not suggesting that<br />\nthe News-Letter refrain from<br />\nprinting articles of interest but<br />\nthat the staff realize that there are<br />\ntwo sides to a story and that each<br />\nside deserves equal coverage.<br />\nFor the sake of fairness and accuracy in reporting, it is about<br />\ntime you recognize the Greek<br />\nSystem at Hopkins for what it is:<br />\nthe associations of men and<br />\nwomen united to enjoy and reap<br />\nthe rewards of brotherhood and<br />\n<br />\nsisterhood. For those unfamiliar<br />\nwith the Greek system at Hopkins<br />\nor still living with the Animal<br />\nHouse image of fraternities,<br />\nbrotherhood and sisterhood is the<br />\nfeeling that results from working<br />\nas a volunteer for the Special<br />\nOlympics or staying up all night<br />\nmaking spaghetti sauce for the<br />\nPastathon, both of which benefit<br />\ncharity.<br />\nJoseph W.

After<br />\ntalking to Ms. Dreisbach, a financial aid counselor there, I learned that Financial Aid had waged<br />\na more comprehensive campaign<br />\nto publicize the deadlines than I<br />\nhad given them credit. They sent<br />\nthe first notification to Gilman<br />\npostboxes when the materials<br />\nwere available in December,<br />\nanother surfaced in the registration packet in January, and<br />\nseveral Campus Notes were run<br />\nin the News-Letter. Dreisbach<br />\nalso pointed out that several<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\ninterested in taking my space<br />\nwhen it appeared in the Lottery.<br />\nI looked for it but did not see it.<br />\nUpon asking in Dormitory housing, I was told that the University is allowing sophomores and<br />\njuniors to stay in Building B until they graduate; however, this<br />\nyear's freshmen cannot live in<br />\nBuilding B after this year. This<br />\nessentially means that at least<br />\nthree to four new spaces will open<br />\nup to the incoming freshmen class<br />\neach year, culminating in 100<br />\n(total) spaces two years from<br />\nnow. I admit this is not a complete solution, but it may help<br />\nreduce the number of freshmen in<br />\nMcCoy and Rodgers.<br />\nAnother point, somewhat<br />\nrelated to the first, concerns the<br />\ncomments made by Rachel Hendrickson in the article \"Admissions.\" While I am the first to admit that Hopkins has many strong<br />\npoints, especially in academics, I<br />\nam not convinced that students<br />\nought to \"buy into the process of<br />\nrecruiting people they think the<br />\ncampus needs.\" It would be a<br />\ngood idea, but I don't thing it<br />\nwould work very well. Reason:<br />\nall one needs to do is listen to or<br />\nread about the comments made by<br />\nstudents on the quality of social<br />\nlife. Some of the problems faced<br />\nby the students (including housing, administrative difficulties,<br />\nand the like), reveal that while<br />\nstudents can present an excellent<br />\nfactual picture of Hopkins, they<br />\nare not necessarily going to actively recruit such needed people<br />\nif they don't feel that those people would enjoy being here.<br />\nThe last comment I have is on<br />\nGretchen Van Utt. I think that the<br />\n\"President's Message\" has been<br />\nsufficiently addressed, however,<br />\nthose who think that the Chaplain<br />\nis not doing the \"proper things\"<br />\nor who feel that they need to<br />\nknow \"what she is up to\" (suggests a conspiracy, no?)ought to<br />\nreconsider. I have seen the<br />\nChaplain \"in action\" only twice,<br />\nyet on both occasions I have been<br />\nimpressed. For those who question why she does what she does,<br />\nI have a simple response: I<br />\nsuspect it's because she sees a<br />\nneed for whatever it may happen<br />\nto be, whether lesbian activities<br />\nor Oxfam. In short, while the<br />\nChaplain's Office may do things<br />\nwhich the Student Council finds<br />\nmysterious or improper, it may<br />\nwell be that the Chaplain is doing them because Student Council is not.<br />\n<br />\nI would like to pose a few comments in response to some of the<br />\narticles and editorials in the April<br />\n8th issue of the News-Letter.<br />\nFirst, you asked where the<br />\nnewly enlarged classes of<br />\nfreshmen could be put to foster a<br />\n\"year of true campus life with<br />\ntheir classmates.\" The University<br />\napparently has found a partial<br />\nsolution for this problem:<br />\nBuilding B. I am a senior living<br />\nin Building B; consequently, I<br />\nwas curious to see who might be<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nposters were placed at hopefully<br />\nstrategic places in the basement of<br />\nGilman. Yet, she admitted, people still go uninformed about the<br />\ndeadline.<br />\nI would like to forward two<br />\nsuggestions to Financial Aid. The<br />\nfirst is to maintain the same<br />\ndeadline year after year. The second is to either alter the times<br />\nwhen notes are sent to Gilman or<br />\nadd another closer to the<br />\ndeadline. December represents a<br />\npoor time for three reasons: first,<br />\nCSS isn't taking applications until January; second, people are<br />\nlikely to forget that notice after<br />\nbeing on break for a month; and<br />\nthird, most parents won't have<br />\ncompleted their tax information<br />\nuntil after Christmas anyway.<br />\nThus, I would urge that notifications be sent to Gilman boxes<br />\nwhen people are more likely to<br />\nact on them. This may remove the<br />\npitfall I fell into this year.<br />\nJosh Knights<br />\n<br />\nChronicle criticisms<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe two-part article appearing<br />\nin the April 1st and 8th issues of<br />\nthe News-Letter on the fraternity system was an inaccurate<br />\ndepiction of the Greek system at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Although<br />\nreprinted from the \"Chronicle of<br />\nHigher Education,\" the article<br />\nmade no attempt to display the<br />\npositive aspects that life in a<br />\nfraternity offers.<br />\nAll of the fraternities and<br />\nsororities at Hopkins work<br />\ntogether on the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil (IFC) to promote unity<br />\nand to work on projects which<br />\nbenefit both the campus and the<br />\nHomewood community. Greek<br />\nmembers pooled their resources<br />\nand together with the IFC sponsored a dance marathon to raise<br />\nmoney for Students Against<br />\nMultiple Sclerosis and held an<br />\nEaster Egg Hunt on Saturday,<br />\nApril 2, 1988, for the children of<br />\nthe faculty and surrounding community. Instead of criticizing the<br />\nGreek system, the News-Letter<br />\nshould publicize events such as<br />\nthese which display the service<br />\nand brotherhood/sisterhood that<br />\nresults from Greek membership<br />\nin the community.<br />\nThe real benefit of fraternity<br />\nlife lies in the individual organization itself. Phi Gamma Delta<br />\nrecently held its annual Islander.<br />\nIt was a tremendous success, with<br />\nthe proceeds going to the Johns<br />\nHopkins Children's Center. FIJI<br />\nhas also increased faculty-student<br />\ninteraction by holding an annual<br />\nopen house in the fall.<br />\nFIJI helps out the community<br />\nby attending Chimes every Friday. The brothers serve as big<br />\nbrothers to the physically and<br />\nmentally challenged. In addition,<br />\nFill raised money for Santa Claus<br />\nAnonymous and The March of<br />\nDimes.<br />\nFinally, I hope I have proved<br />\nthat the fraternity system was unjustly criticized and should be<br />\ngiven reconsideration within the<br />\nHopkins community. The student<br />\nbody and the surrounding community stand to lose much by doing away with the fraternity<br />\nsystem.<br />\nMichael Guido<br />\n<br />\n\fr<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/1 1<br />\n<br />\nThe new Nat. Sc.: a more stringent schedule<br />\nCURRICULUM, from 9<br />\nresearch, or internships.<br />\n(5)Proficiency in a moderr,<br />\nforeign language equivalent to<br />\none year of elements or one<br />\nsemester of intermediate level.<br />\nThe University also requires<br />\nfor graduation that you complete<br />\nat least 120 credits and maintain<br />\na 2.0 GPA.<br />\nAlready you can see that this is<br />\na potful of requirements. Let's<br />\nbreak it down in practical terms.<br />\nThe first reqirement ensures<br />\nthat science majors take at least<br />\nintroductory course work across<br />\nthe sciences. An anomaly is the<br />\nlack of a year of introductory<br />\nbiology and lab. As we know,<br />\nHopkins does not have such an<br />\noffering. Nor does Hopkins allow<br />\nnatural science majors to count<br />\nAP biology toward their requirements. Thus, the year of<br />\nbiology and lab that medical<br />\nschools demand and that the<br />\nnatural sciences majors normally take here is molecular cell<br />\n<br />\nbiology and lab, which are<br />\nnumbered at the 300 level.<br />\nHere's the rub: Most<br />\nundergraduate in the sciences and<br />\nall those with medical school<br />\naspirations take two semesters of<br />\nmolecular cell biology with lab,<br />\nwhich if viewed as introductroy<br />\ncourses\u2014albeit very sophisticated<br />\nintroductory courses\u2014should<br />\nthen count toward the requirement in (2). Remembering that<br />\ncourses used to meet requirements in (1)or (2)cannot be<br />\nused to fulfill the upper-level<br />\nscience course requirements, this<br />\nwould preclude MCB from being<br />\nused to meet 300 level course requirements. That, my friends\u2014<br />\ni.e. not allowing MCB to be used to meet upper-level science<br />\nrequirements\u2014is \"the heart\" of<br />\nthe new guidelines for this area<br />\nmajor.<br />\nWhy, you ask, should<br />\nmolecular cell biology, which is<br />\neffectively r. required course for<br />\neligibility to medical school, be<br />\ncounted with the introductory<br />\n<br />\ncourses despite (a) its 300<br />\nnumber, and (b) the fact that it is<br />\na tough course, demanding two<br />\nsemesters of introductory<br />\nchemistry plus labs and a<br />\nsemester of organic chemistry as<br />\nde facto prerequisites?

As we<br />\nhave seen, it does not involve that<br />\nmuch more advanced science than<br />\nit used to and about the same<br />\namount as the departmental majors. For instance, if biophysics<br />\ncourse work interests you but the<br />\nadvanced physics scares you<br />\naway from the major, you could<br />\nput three biophysics courses<br />\ntogether with a couple of upperlevel psychology or biology<br />\ncourses to meet the requirement.<br />\nAnother obvious option is to<br />\nmajor in a natural sciences<br />\ndepartment. Biology, indeed, will<br />\ncertainly increase its numbers of<br />\nmajors. Over time, perhaps,<br />\nE&PS or Biophysics will attract<br />\nsome disaffected natural sciences<br />\narea majors. In all likelihood<br />\nPhysics and Chemistry, owing to<br />\nthe perceived difficulty of their<br />\nrequirements, will show little<br />\ngrowth in the numbers of majors<br />\nthey have. If these changes do occur, then the desire to encourage<br />\nstudents to focus in one science<br />\ndiscipline will effectively turn out<br />\nonly to swell the ranks of the<br />\nbiology majors and prompt<br />\nundergraduates, especially<br />\npremeds, to look outside the<br />\nsciences for a major.<br />\nIndeed, choosing a non-natural<br />\n<br />\nsciences major is increasingly an<br />\nattractive option. Psychology,<br />\nalready a popular major, should<br />\nbecome much more so. The requirements here include four<br />\nlower-level psychology courses,<br />\nfour 300\u2014level psychology<br />\ncourses, two semesters of<br />\nstatistics, and one computer<br />\nscience course. The major has no<br />\nforeign language requirements, a<br />\ndubious advantage, but one that<br />\ncan ease your schedule.<br />\nPsychology also requires nine<br />\ncredits of natural sciences, which<br />\nfor premeds is superfluous and<br />\nfor the rest of you undergrads<br />\nshould present little problem.<br />\nAnother discipline that may<br />\nbenefit from the change in the<br />\nnatural sciences area major is far<br />\nless known than psychology. It is<br />\nHistory of Science, which this<br />\nyear will graduate its single<br />\nundergraduate major in the last<br />\nthree years! (This is a shame<br />\nbecause the department is excellent and the course work provocative.) The history of science<br />\nmajor follows the old natural<br />\nsciences area guidelines in requiring students to take forty (N)<br />\ncredits, with fifteen(N)credits at<br />\nthe 300 level. Importantly, advanced laboratories are not excluded, so both those semesters of<br />\nMCB lab would work toward the<br />\nrequirement.<br />\nThe point not to be missed is<br />\nthat after this year, the natural<br />\nsciences area major will no longer<br />\nfunction as a fallback option for<br />\nundergrads. Quite the opposite is<br />\nthe case. Now an undergrad will<br />\nhave to plan his/her course work<br />\n<br />\nwith relative precision two or<br />\nfour semesters in advance to insure meeting the requirements.<br />\nPlanning is the key in whatever<br />\nmajor you pursue. An effective<br />\nacademic plan allows you to<br />\nmake Hopkins work for you. Too<br />\nmany undergrads feel that this is<br />\nnot the case, that Hopkins is an<br />\nacademic war zone with<br />\ndangerous courses, sniping<br />\nT.A.'s, ruthless professors and<br />\nenough catch-22 situations for<br />\n<br />\nYossarian. The net result is<br />\nheightened pressure across an<br />\nalready tense campus.<br />\nBy thinking through your fall<br />\nschedule a semester or, better yet,<br />\na year in advance, you reduce the<br />\npressure. Talk to your faculty advisor. Show him/her your<br />\ntranscript along with the schedule<br />\nof courses you need and want to<br />\ntake. You can make use of your<br />\nfaculty advisor as a resource by<br />\ntentatively outlining your plans<br />\n<br />\nand then getting his/her input.<br />\nOtherwise, your advisor will all<br />\ntoo often be simply a signature on<br />\nyour preregistration slip.<br />\nOf course, the Office of<br />\nAcademic Advising remains at<br />\nyour service from 8:30-5:00,<br />\nfive days a week. If you want to<br />\ndiscuss the new natural sciences<br />\nrequirements or any other<br />\nacademic matters, just call<br />\n338-8216 and<br />\nmake an<br />\nappointment.<br />\n<br />\nLittle More Leeway<br />\nLEE. from 8<br />\njust run-of-the-mill. Language lab<br />\ncould be made into a laundromat.<br />\nCereal boxes would go unread.<br />\nCrosswords would read like<br />\nBINGO cards. Stevie could no<br />\nlonger read Playboy and Penthouse \"just for the articles.\"<br />\nIt may have taken a while to get<br />\nused to, but I realized that there's<br />\na certain beauty in a dizzying sequence of binary. Of course,<br />\nASCII isn't so bad either: \"To be<br />\nor not to be\":<br />\n(84)(111)(32)(98)(101)<br />\n(32)(111)(114)(32)(110)(111)<br />\n(84)(32)(84)(111)(32)(98)(101)<br />\n(46). Simple. Unadulterated.<br />\nLeaves no room for deconstruction or textual analysis. And<br />\nwouldn't Thomas Moore have<br />\npreferred a dizzying string of<br />\nbinary to \"The time I've lost in<br />\nwooing/ In watching and pursuing/ The light that lies/ In<br />\nwoman's eyes,/ Has been my<br />\nheart's undoing/ Tho wisdom oft<br />\nhas sought me/ I scorned the lore<br />\n<br />\nshe brought me,/ My only<br />\nbooks/, Were woman's looks,/<br />\nAnd folly's all they taught me\"?<br />\nAfter all, it's much easier to<br />\nrhyme numbers.<br />\nThe more I thought about it, the<br />\nmore convinced I became that<br />\nlanguages were passe, numbers<br />\nwere chic. Since I'm such a<br />\ndevoted Hoppie, it only seemed<br />\nnatural that my thinking would<br />\nturn towards Homewood. My inquiries produced a proposal<br />\nwhich I feel merits considerable<br />\nattention from the Board of<br />\nTrustees. The School of Arts &<br />\nSciences (the Commas) is running at a deficit, with no chance to<br />\nturn it around for at least five<br />\nyears. The engineering school<br />\n(the Wrenches), on the other<br />\nhand, receives grants galore. We<br />\nat Hopkins pride ourselves on living at the cutting edge of<br />\neverything (except social life, of<br />\ncourse, but that's entirely another<br />\nmatter). Let's be innovators.<br />\nLet's show Bennington, Amherst,<br />\nand all those other artsy-fartsy<br />\n<br />\nliberal arts wimps that we're not<br />\ngoing to stand for their writing<br />\nworkshops and university press<br />\njournals. We're going to take all<br />\nour philologists, poets, and pundits and make them lab-workers.<br />\nIn order to rescue the sciences,<br />\nwe'll change the name of the<br />\nchemistry department to \"Atomic<br />\nEngineering,\" and the bio department to \"Life Engineering.\"<br />\nThen we'll hire all the liberal arts<br />\nstudents as lab rats, give the new<br />\natomic engineering department<br />\nGilman Hall to do with what they<br />\nwill, empty out MSE and make<br />\nit into a particle accelerator. Then<br />\nwe'll hoist the flag which proudly proclaims \"Hopkins Institute<br />\nof Technology.\" An added<br />\nbenefit: since the \"The\" and the<br />\n\"Johns\" have been eliminated we<br />\nwon't have to deal with those annoying misnomers.

In the darkness of the<br />\ncanvas covered truck-bed, people<br />\nwere betting on who would command the highlight of the FTX,<br />\nthe night raid. \"Two-to-one on<br />\nFenzel,\" someone said; the oddsmakers were hard at work. Karen<br />\nGrennon, a senior cadet, was sitting next to me, and explained the<br />\nlight-natured conversation was<br />\nnot uncommon. \"We spend so<br />\nmuch time together, it's inevitable that some of your best<br />\nfriends are also in ROTC.\"<br />\nOn the way I dug into my<br />\npocket and pulled out an MRE<br />\ncookie. Sweet and bland, it tasted<br />\nlike it was made of plaster of<br />\nparis and sugar.<br />\nWe finally got off the trucks<br />\nand assembled into squads and<br />\nstood around. My fingers and<br />\ntoes hurt from the cold. I had ten<br />\npockets on my uniform, none of<br />\nwhich were designed for warming my hands.<br />\nThe cadets started training at<br />\n7:30 a.m. by doing some D & C<br />\n(Drill and Ceremony, i.e. marching), I took the opportunity to<br />\ntalk with Major Hawkins, who instructs the senior cadets about the<br />\ntheory behind marching around a<br />\nparking lot. \"It has a lot to do<br />\nwith the confidence that the men<br />\nhave in you,\" explained<br />\nHawkins. \"Organization is vital,<br />\nso is morale. If soldiers do things<br />\nin sync, they look good; it improves morale and pride. The<br />\nmore they practice, the better<br />\nthey'll look. . . hopefully. The<br />\njuniors will be graded on leadership this summer, partly on how<br />\nwell they command D&C.<br />\nI rejoined Bravo Company<br />\nwhen they were preparing to do<br />\na practical land navigation test.<br />\nEveryone was given a different<br />\nset of four points on a 2.5<br />\nkilometer course. The objective<br />\nwas to find your way from point<br />\nto point given only the compass<br />\nheadings and distances. I went<br />\nwith Ray, crossing creeks, down<br />\none side of ravines and up the<br />\nother. I was very hungry and<br />\n<br />\ndecided to eat some breakfast, a<br />\ndehydrated pork patty. \"It's better if you don't reconstitute it,\"<br />\nremarked Ray. Frankly, I don't<br />\nsee how it could have been much<br />\nworse.<br />\nWe finished the course and did<br />\nsome more D&C. This time I<br />\njoined in.<br />\nAt noon we broke for chow.<br />\nWe had twenty minutes we could<br />\nalmost call our own. By that time<br />\nI was famished, although at least<br />\nthe weather had started to warm<br />\nup. I had some fortified crackers<br />\nthat looked like ceiling tiles, applesauce, and some dry fortified<br />\ncocoa mix, which, as Cadet First<br />\nSergeant Wan Kim told me,<br />\n\"tastes like malted milk balls.\"<br />\nPractkally everything was fortified, even the instant coffee. I<br />\ncouldn't imagine what it would be<br />\nlike to live on MRE's for more<br />\nthan a day..Those who had, told<br />\nme that constipation was the<br />\neventual nemesis of MRE-ridden<br />\nbattallions. What else could you<br />\nexpect from eating virtually<br />\nfiberless food that tasted better<br />\ndehydrated?<br />\n\"There's some gum in your<br />\nMRE,\" said Cadet SFC<br />\nStephanie Spengler. \"They put it<br />\nin there for a reason.\" I fished it<br />\nout and bit into it. Even the gum<br />\n4 was dehydrated. It broke into<br />\npieces before eventually becoming chewable. After chow we<br />\nmarched around the parking lot<br />\nfor another hour.<br />\nI was still trying to find out why<br />\nthese students were in ROTC. It<br />\nwas obvious that not everyone<br />\nwas gung-ho on joining the army.<br />\nDuring chow, one cadet asked if<br />\nanyone had some aspirin,jokingly adding, \"I always get a<br />\nheadache when I put on a<br />\nuniform. Must be the starch.\"<br />\nColonel Morris later filled me<br />\nin on the obvious answer. \"There<br />\nare only 12,000 Army ROTC<br />\nscholarships yearly; they're very<br />\ncompetitive. Most students in<br />\nHopkins' ROTC are on scholarship. The drop-out rate is<br />\nrelatively low. We start the year<br />\nwith around 110 cadets, and by<br />\n<br />\nArmy ROTC's standing eagerly anticipating their next orders.<br />\n<br />\nthe end we usually have 80. Some<br />\ndon't get the scholarships they<br />\nwant, mostly freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, and some leave the<br />\nuniversity.\u2014<br />\n, Soon, however, the real field<br />\ntraining started. We were issued<br />\nM-16's with blank adaptors, forty rounds of blanks, and a dummy cord, one end of which was<br />\ntied to the rifle, the other tied to<br />\nour belts. Cadet ISG Patrick<br />\nLynch explained, \"A rifle is a<br />\nsensitive item. You'll do pushups if you drop it, fire it accidently, or leave it for a moment.\" We<br />\ncamouflaged our faces and left<br />\nfor the TAX (Tactical Application<br />\neXercise) lanes.<br />\nThe first lane to which my<br />\nsquad was assigned was reaction<br />\nto contact, which included sniper<br />\nfire, artillery fire, and near and<br />\nfar ambushes. This was not a<br />\ngame. Afterwards, the seniors,<br />\nCadet Captains Jodi Nocholosi<br />\n<br />\nAdil Al-Shabkhoun<br />\n<br />\nTwo excited-looking ROTC'ers contemplate the prospect of eating nothing but MRE's. Don't they look like<br />\nthey're having fun?<br />\n<br />\nand Steve Angerthal, who ran the<br />\nlane, wasted no time in constructively criticizing the mistakes of<br />\nthe juniors.<br />\nNext we moved through the<br />\nmuddy woods to have Cadet Major Doug McPherson explain the<br />\npractical subtleties of staging a<br />\nhasty ambush. After that, my legs<br />\nwere scratched up from walking<br />\nthrough the brush, but it was not<br />\nuntil the last TAX lane that I<br />\nrealized how bad the brush could<br />\nget.<br />\nCadet Captain Todd Baker explained our objective for the last<br />\nlane: reconnaissance of some<br />\nelectrical towers. Throughout the<br />\nattack lanes, seniors and<br />\nfreshmen had the role of being<br />\nOPFOR (OPposition FORces). In<br />\nthis lane we were supposed to<br />\nclandestinely determine if the<br />\ntowers were guarded, and if so,<br />\nby how many OPFORs. Tom<br />\nHenkel was put in command of<br />\nthis operation. I was chosen to accompany Henkel on the mission.<br />\nThings were going fine until he<br />\nand I were at the edge of the<br />\nwoods, taking note of the situation. There were two OPFORs<br />\nposting guard at the tower.<br />\nCrouching low in the underbrush, Henkel had a thorn pierce<br />\nhis earlobe. When I tried to<br />\nunhook him, we were spotted and<br />\nfired on. We quickly pulled out<br />\nand made our way back to the<br />\nbase that had been set up. It was<br />\nonly later that I realized I had<br />\nscratched my legs on some barbed wire on our escape route.<br />\nThe exercise was now completed. We marched back to the<br />\nparking lot. I realized that<br />\neveryone had been scratched by<br />\nthe brush. \"We have some minor<br />\ninjuries, some cuts by the brush<br />\nmost typically, but nothing<br />\nserious. The Army is very safety<br />\nconscious,\" explained Morris.<br />\nWhen we got back, we were informed that the night raid had<br />\nbeen cancelled because of lack of<br />\nspace. Kwan later explained,<br />\n\"The guy who ran Gunpowder<br />\nretired, and his replacement did<br />\nnot notice we were scheduled to<br />\n<br />\nuse the reserve. Basically, our<br />\npaperwork got lost in the shuffle.\" It was decided that we<br />\nshould get back into the trucks<br />\nand finish the exercise at<br />\nHopkins. Instead of doing a night<br />\nraid, the cadets would have to<br />\nplan it out fully.<br />\nEverybody was exhausted as<br />\nwe lumbered towards the trucks<br />\nuntil senior cadet major Ed Marsh<br />\ntold us we had thirty seconds to<br />\nget stowed away. Somehow, we<br />\ndid it.<br />\nThe ride back to Hopkins was<br />\nquieter than the ride out. We got<br />\nback at quarter to seven.<br />\n\"You've got two minutes to get<br />\ninto the building,\" yelled Marsh<br />\nEverybody started moving.<br />\nMarsh briefed the cadets on the<br />\npatrol order and assigned the<br />\ncommands to the cadets.<br />\nFor the next six hours the<br />\ncadets worked on the platoon<br />\norder, and upon completing it,<br />\nthey turned to the tedious task of<br />\ncleaning the rifles. At 3:15 a.m.<br />\nthe FTX was over and the cadets<br />\nwent home.<br />\nThe cadets had done a lot that<br />\nday, but it was not just an exercise in endurance. \"Hopkins<br />\ncomes in the top ten of all the<br />\nschools that go to Advanced<br />\nCamp,\" explained Morris, \"due<br />\nmainly to the combination of the<br />\ncaliber of students, the etxtent of<br />\nthe training, and the enthusiasm.<br />\nThe seniors set up and carried out<br />\nthis exercise, so the leadership is<br />\npassed along.<br />\n\"The idea is not to make infantry commanders out of these<br />\ncadets but to use tactics as a tool<br />\nto develop officers. We put them<br />\nin stressful situations and see how<br />\nthey lead, how people react to<br />\nthem. Are they forceful and aggressive? And if things go wrong,<br />\ndo they fall apart or adjust?\"<br />\nMorris added.<br />\nDespite occasional jokes, it was<br />\nobvious that everybody took the<br />\nexercise seriously.

Perhaps the<br />\nbiggest critiqfie of this album is<br />\nthat some of the music is a bit incongruous, like Roy Orbison's<br />\n\"Life Fades Away\" being sand-<br />\n<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\n<br />\nwiched between Aerosmith and<br />\nPoison. In the case of these<br />\nsubtler tunes, however, they provide a stark contrast to the frenzy that surrounds them, and since<br />\nthey all deal with rather heavy<br />\nsubjects like death and love, they<br />\nmight be seen as the moments of<br />\nintrospection in an otherwise<br />\ncrazed environment. In all, Rubin<br />\nhas done an excellent job of compiling music that works in terms<br />\nof the film, while still providing<br />\nsomething for all the music enthusiasts who'll buy the<br />\nsoundtrack.<br />\nProbably no one, however, has<br />\nas much experience in combining<br />\nhip music with film as John<br />\nHughes, the king of the<br />\n\"youthploitation\" film. All of<br />\nHughes' films have featured<br />\nsoundtracks that sold as well as<br />\nthe film, at least in part because<br />\nhe knows enough about music to<br />\npick up on what's popular\u2014and,<br />\n<br />\nalso weakens the film since it<br />\nseems difficult to resolve the<br />\nserious tone of the film with the<br />\narrested adolescence of the<br />\nsoundtrack. If Hughes was interested in attracting an older audience with his material, perhaps<br />\nhe should have re-thought his<br />\nsoundtrack, and aimed at a slightly older, more sophisticated audience. Don't get me wrong\u2014it's<br />\na fine compilation that holds<br />\ntogether well, and it features<br />\nenough new stuff to make it worth<br />\nbuying, but it just seems out of<br />\nplace with the content of the film.<br />\nI don't know, maybe I should try<br />\ngetting married and having a kid,<br />\nand then see what music I like\u2014<br />\nmaybe I would start feeling<br />\nnostalgic for some Love and<br />\nRocket, who knows?<br />\n<br />\nin cases of films like Pretty in<br />\nPink, it was the music that sold<br />\nthe film. Hughes might have<br />\nstruck out, however, with his new<br />\nfilm, She's Having a Baby. The<br />\nproblem's not with the music.<br />\nHell, with originals by folks like<br />\nDave Wakeling (General Public,<br />\nthe English Beat) and unreleased<br />\ntracks by groups like Love and<br />\nRockets and XTC, followed up<br />\nwith such reliable stand-bys as<br />\nBryan Ferry and Kate Bush, this<br />\nsoundtrack boasts enough<br />\nmaterial to send any sixteen-yearold into a \"hipness overdose.\"<br />\nThe problem is, do the people<br />\nwho listen to this music want to<br />\nsee a film about yuppies getting<br />\nmarried and having a kid? It<br />\nseems that Hughes might be<br />\nshooting for one audience with<br />\nhis screenplay and another entire<br />\naudience with the soundtrack.<br />\nSuch a strategy would draw in<br />\ntwo unrelated audiences, but it<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nAmy Reiter on<br />\nthe Musical Showcase<br />\nMUSIC<br />\n<br />\nby Amy Reiter<br />\nVoices, guitars, pianos, synthesizers, accordions, bagpipes.<br />\nThere were a helluvalot of kinds<br />\nof music heard in Shriver last<br />\nThursday night.<br />\nAnd there are a helluvalot of<br />\nmusically talented people here at<br />\nHopkins.

Each act<br />\nran about six minutes, one or<br />\ntwo songs. This gave the performer a chance to show his stuff<br />\nwithout requiring an extensive<br />\nrepertoire. It was a \"best of..<br />\nshow. You just know how much<br />\npractice has gone into each<br />\nperformance.<br />\nThe performers were judged in<br />\nfive categories: Classical, Pop,<br />\nRock, Miscellaneous, and Best<br />\nOverall Performer.

I had to send<br />\na note to make sure that the<br />\ntrue love of friendship has not<br />\n\u2022 faded,since I do not hear from<br />\nmany of us anymore, and there<br />\nare few left. I recollect those<br />\ndays at the academy with<br />\nrenewed vigor even as I write.<br />\nI remember Beezub and you<br />\nand myself on that mountain<br />\nnot too many summers ago.<br />\nBeezub had those old flat soled cowboy boots, and all it<br />\ntook was one good push from<br />\nthe two of us to send him<br />\nskating down the mountainside, his joyous screams mixed<br />\nwith ones of terror as his cloud<br />\nof dust faded into the dusk.<br />\nI draw on these visions out<br />\nof a mind clouded with<br />\nalcoholic fondness of a youth<br />\nthat will live forever in the articles about the academy<br />\nwhich I have been asked to<br />\nwrite, by the new administration. How do you like that? No<br />\nlonger shall the young men be<br />\ntrained by the headmaster and<br />\ndeans<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\nthe<br />\nschoolmasters, but by principals and teachers and<br />\ncounselors.

He seemed<br />\ndistraught over what he had<br />\nseen and wrote only of the last<br />\ndays we had spent together.<br />\nI sensed a drunken quality to<br />\nhis ramblings and could not<br />\npin down exactly which wrong<br />\ndetour his mind had taken to<br />\nbecome so lost in a sandstorm<br />\nof memories. He also recounted the ride down the<br />\nmountain that day, but his narrative did not carry the usual<br />\nfondness that often punctuated<br />\nmany of Beezub's recollection.<br />\nIt was as if the kind and gentle nature had been excised by<br />\na violent and swift blade, leaving a vacant abyss, flooded<br />\nwith an uncharacteristic<br />\ncheerless disposition.<br />\nI am asking you to tell me<br />\nwhat you think of all of this,<br />\nsince you chose to lead a more<br />\nstable life, going into your<br />\nfather's business like we<br />\nalways knew you would. Can<br />\nwe be blamed for carrying out<br />\nour youthful dreams of<br />\nadventure?<br />\nSensing the distraught<br />\nnature of Beezub, I asked him<br />\nto come and visit my cabin until the cold snap of late fall<br />\nwould drive us either back to<br />\ncivilization or to another<br />\nassignment or adventure. He<br />\nsent a reply sooner than I<br />\nwould have thought possible,<br />\n<br />\ns ow y sprea into the ranks o and it was strangely signed,<br />\nthe alumni until our memories \"Beezub the Wanderer.\"<br />\nof the green lawns and- I arrived at the cabin several<br />\nmonumental buildings shall days in<br />\nadvance and<br />\ndwindle into nothingness.<br />\nstraightened things up, stockI have been having trouble, ing the pantry with some<br />\nthough.

The fall was<br />\nverge of insanity has left the just settling in, so the day was<br />\ndays I now seek obscured by cool and mosquito free as<br />\nother layers.

He walked from the old<br />\nand I don't want my work to Ranger jeep with the swagger<br />\nbe seen as a foil's reminiscient of a young man,and tossed his<br />\nvision of a lost time.

Hell, of course we can go<br />\nand give it a try.\"<br />\nBoth of us broke out<br />\nlaughing at the idea of going<br />\nafter the trout which we had<br />\nnamed after the headmaster in<br />\nour youth at the academy. I<br />\ndidn't know if he was still<br />\nalive, but it would be good to<br />\ngo and find out. If he was<br />\nthere, Beezub and I were<br />\ndetermined, as always, to catch<br />\nhim.<br />\nBeezub told me about a recent fishing trip as he fixed us<br />\na couple drinks. \"The stream<br />\nwe had been following was full<br />\nof salmon. A few of us had<br />\nbeen smart enough to bring<br />\nour fly rods, and the action<br />\n<br />\nwas incredib e. At one point<br />\nwas wading in mid-stream up<br />\nto my nuts in freezing water<br />\nwhen a huge Koho took off<br />\nwith my fly. I got dragged in up<br />\nto my armpits before I landed<br />\nhim. I carried him back above<br />\nmy head, my knife stuck in his<br />\nskull. That was the best dinner<br />\nI had the whole summer.\"<br />\nWe sat on the porch in high<br />\nback chairs while the meat<br />\nsizzled on the grill. Beezub still<br />\nhad the lean build of his<br />\nyounger day, and wore a white<br />\nshirt tucked crisply into tan<br />\nshorts. His hair was combed<br />\nback and blond from the odd<br />\nmonths of the desert sun,<br />\nwhich had also left him with a<br />\nleathery complexion, from<br />\nbehind which his eyes twinkled in the fall air.<br />\nI still sensed a great wall in<br />\nhim, behind which stormed<br />\nthe minions of whatever<br />\ntempest assailed him. The only relief afforded him was to<br />\ntalk about some of his earlier<br />\nadventures. He spoke fondly<br />\n<br />\nnot only of his fishing expeditear he spent<br />\nin Australia.<br />\n\"I'm telling you, the country<br />\nis a virgin land. The raw power<br />\nthat shapes continents still exists there, I have felt it. I did<br />\nsome of my best work up in<br />\nQueensland. I would lug the<br />\nold Underwood up there and<br />\nand spend days hammering<br />\naway at the keys, aware of<br />\nsome kind of direction shaping<br />\nmy thoughts. It was as if the<br />\nland had bridged the gap between my ideas and that battered old typewriter. It's closing on the frontier now,<br />\nthough. The aborigines are being squeezed out of existence.<br />\nThey don't have any means to<br />\nfight for their land, and as a<br />\nresult they are suffering horribly. Of course in Afghanistan<br />\nthe rebels have the means, but<br />\neven their bloody children are<br />\nbeing. . \" He stopped and<br />\nlooked at his hands, which had<br />\nbeen punctuating his remarks.<br />\n\"Beezub, I think our steaks<br />\nare ready,\" I said, just to stop<br />\nthe look that had fallen on his<br />\nface. I stared in grim fascination. His face was like a neon<br />\nsign flickering in a shop window. Something evil had<br />\nfound him and made its<br />\nremark. I was if the door to<br />\nhell had opened up, and the<br />\nDevil had stared him right in<br />\nthe eye. I had never seen him<br />\ntions, but of the<br />\n<br />\nlike this. He loo e up with a<br />\nsmile that could freeze water<br />\nand said, \"Let's eat then.\"<br />\nWe had shared too much for<br />\nme to turn my back, but I was<br />\nnot sure I would be able to<br />\nweather the storm which now<br />\nthreatened.<br />\nWe ate in silence. Beezub<br />\nwould sit back and stare into<br />\nthe forest as he chewed each<br />\nmouthfull, then he would<br />\nglance over at me. I kept my<br />\neyes focused on my plate, worried that whatever I might say<br />\nwould provoke unwanted<br />\nmemories. All he said was,<br />\n\"This is good.\"<br />\nAfter dinner, I gathered my<br />\nfishing equipment and picked<br />\nout a light, handbuilt rod. I<br />\nhad whiled away a few hours<br />\ntying some of my own flies<br />\nwhil waiting for Beezub, and<br />\nthere was a new one I was<br />\nespecially eager to try.

Much<br />\nof Paton's desire for change in<br />\nSouth Africa arose from this experience, which instilled a deep<br />\ncynicism in regards to the dark<br />\nside of all human nature.<br />\nWhile at Diepkloof, Paton<br />\nwrote his most famous work, Cry<br />\nthe Beloved Country which was<br />\n<br />\nI watched as Beezub glanced into the depths were old<br />\nLawson supposedly made his<br />\nhome.I always marveled at the<br />\nway the huge tree had fallen so<br />\nmany years ago to form the<br />\nsluice which had cut the<br />\noverhang into the rock. I imagined the old trout might still<br />\nbe under there, giving us the<br />\ncalculating glances that we<br />\nwere giving him. Beezub truly<br />\nbelieved that the old fish might<br />\nlive that long, and he made the<br />\nfirst few casts into the middle<br />\nof the stream just to test the<br />\n<br />\nJonathan Engler<br />\ntranslated into twenty languages,<br />\nmade into a film soon thereafter,<br />\nand even became a tragic<br />\nmusical. A book called Too Late<br />\nfor Phalarope and a series of<br />\nshort stories followed.<br />\nPaton was also president of the<br />\nLiberal Party of South Africa until its ban in 1968, and his opposition to the policy of apartheid led<br />\nto the seizure of his passport by<br />\nthe South African government in<br />\n1960 upon his return from a visit<br />\nto the United States where he had<br />\nreceived a Freedom House<br />\naward.<br />\nHis sparse and tightly controlled style was also expressed in the<br />\ncolumn he wrote for the political<br />\njournal Contact, as well as<br />\nnumerous political commentaries<br />\nranging from history to<br />\nsociology.<br />\nIn the end, however, it is for<br />\nhis novels that he is best<br />\n<br />\nwaters. I sat and watched for<br />\na few minutes, pretending to<br />\nunsnare my line, captivated by<br />\nthe intentness of Beezub on<br />\nthe eddys and currents around<br />\nthe lengthening shadow of the<br />\noverhand. He pulled in a few<br />\nsmall rainbows, but slid them<br />\noff the hook, which had a<br />\ncrimped barb, letting them<br />\ngently go. It was always his<br />\nstyle, believing even in the<br />\nsanctity of the small fish.<br />\nI joined him,casting wide into the shadows, a small current<br />\npulling my fly straight into the<br />\n<br />\nremembered, particularly the<br />\nmasterpiece Cry the Beloved<br />\nCountry. Those who consider<br />\nthemselves to be on the leading<br />\nedge of progressive politics in<br />\ntheir opposition to South African<br />\npolitical tactics should bear in<br />\nmind that this work was written<br />\nin 1948. Paton spent a courageous<br />\nlife in direct opposition to a very<br />\npowerful regime in which the<br />\ncracks have only recently begun<br />\nto appear. His life stands in contrast to the politics of instant<br />\ngratification which we have<br />\nbecome used to in the United<br />\nStates, and as such there are<br />\nlessons to be learned as we<br />\nbecome nonchalant about continuing racism in the United States.<br />\nChange comes slow in its lasting<br />\nform, and no-one knew this better or worked harder in spite of<br />\nit than Alan Stewart Paton.<br />\n<br />\nheart of the cleft. Just as the<br />\nbait floated clear into the<br />\nsunlight, a large swirl appeared<br />\nand a dark shadown passed<br />\nunder the bait.

For a moment it seemed to be caught in the wrong<br />\neddy, but it drifted strangely<br />\ntowards the opposite bank and<br />\ninto the same current that had<br />\ncarried my fly into the shadow.<br />\nThis time the dark spot<br />\nbeneath the surface appeared<br />\nsooner, and the fly disappeared with a small splash. A<br />\nwake left by the tail of the fish<br />\nwas the only thing which<br />\nmarked the spot. Beezub bit<br />\nhis lower lip, and I pulled in<br />\nthe rest of my line, eager to<br />\nwatch the impending struggle.<br />\nBeezub eased his rod back as<br />\nthe line tightened, then spooled in a bit of the fly line. Easing and spooling, he slowly<br />\npulled the fish out of the<br />\nnotch. It remained deep, not<br />\nrevealing its size. Beezub remained calm, maintaining the<br />\nrhythm of his retrieval, until<br />\nthe trout showed himself in a<br />\nspectacular leap about<br />\nmid-stream.<br />\nBeezub eased back his rod.<br />\nIt was old Lawson if I had ever<br />\nseen him, in all of his aged<br />\nglory. The setting sun shined<br />\noff of his gleaming sides and<br />\nplayed off the arc of water<br />\nwhich had followed him into<br />\nthe high leap. His huge tail fin<br />\nhad propelled him hard<br />\nenough against the direction of<br />\nBeezub's pull that the line<br />\nsnapped right where the leader<br />\njoined the floating line. Old<br />\nLawson entered the water<br />\ncleanly and was gone with a<br />\nsilent beat of his tail. Beezub's<br />\ndisappointment was great as<br />\nthe fish disappeared. He took<br />\nout a cigarette and sat on a<br />\nstump to smoke.<br />\nI muttered something about<br />\n\"getting a couple for<br />\nbreakfast,\" and set to tying a<br />\nnew fly on his line. While he<br />\nbrooded over his smoke, I<br />\nnoticed that the line had not<br />\nbroken, but had come untied:<br />\nIt was a hastily tied knot. I<br />\nknew then that something was<br />\ndisturbing his concentration<br />\ngreatly enough to upset his<br />\nnatural instincts, which were<br />\nborn of years in the rough,<br />\nsometimes fighting for<br />\nsurvival.<br />\nHe sat there smoking and<br />\nmuttering to himself as his free<br />\nhand sliced the air in front of<br />\nhim. I said nothing and cast<br />\nabout, but to no avail. Old<br />\nLawson had warned the rest of<br />\n<br />\nthe trout that we were here,<br />\nand was probably stroking<br />\nhimself with his fins, smug in<br />\nhis escape, motionless at the<br />\nback of the hollow.<br />\nBeezub stood up and packed<br />\nhis gear.\"I know that we were<br />\nnever meant to catch him, but<br />\nsomehow I felt that today we<br />\ncould have if we were ever going to be able to land him. It<br />\nwould have been hard to let<br />\nhim go, but now he is gone<br />\nanyway.\"<br />\nI had the same feeling when<br />\nwe had gone out there, but said<br />\nnothing of it. \"I bet it wasn't<br />\neven the old bastard.\"<br />\n\"Sure it was,\" he said.<br />\nWe did not talk much on the<br />\nway back, nor did we say much<br />\nbefore going off to bed. We sat<br />\nby the fireplace having a few<br />\ndrinks and smoking cigars.<br />\nThe silence was accented by<br />\nthe few feeble attempts at conversation, and I was soon<br />\nready for sleep.<br />\nWhen I got up in the morning, he was gone. He left a note<br />\nof thanks and an open-ended<br />\noffer to visit him over<br />\nChristmas. I was going to take<br />\nhim up on it, but I got a<br />\npostcard from him saying that<br />\nhe would be on assignment in<br />\nthe Andes for awhile, and if I<br />\nwould be so kind as to extend<br />\nmy plans until next year.<br />\nI never could figure out<br />\nwhat was disturbing Beezub so<br />\nmuch.I think he came to terms<br />\nwith it sometime on his way to<br />\nSouth America, but I don't<br />\nthink that he ever really<br />\nrecovered fully.

I think we knew<br />\nhim better than that.<br />\nAs the sun goes down on one<br />\nmore day, I feel the onset of a<br />\nquieter life, maybe with a wife<br />\nand a child.

For eighteen<br />\ncenturies the country was<br />\nneglected by its rulers, and higher<br />\neducation was nonexistent. The<br />\nreturn of Jews, which began 100<br />\nyears ago, marked a new era. The<br />\nHebrew University in Jerusalem<br />\nwas founded in 1918, followed by<br />\nthe Technion in Haifa a few years<br />\nlater.<br />\nIn 1948 the State of Israel was<br />\nborn. While struggling with<br />\nsevere security and economic<br />\nproblems, Israel absorbed<br />\nmillions of Jewish refugees from<br />\nEurope and the Middle East and<br />\nat the same time developed an excellent education system. Israelis<br />\ntoday (4 million in number) enjoy six major universities and<br />\nother excellent research institutions. In only 40 years Israel has<br />\nbecome a leader in many scientific and industrial specialties,<br />\nagriculture, medicine, solar<br />\nenergy and others. Today the<br />\ncountry leads the world in the<br />\nnumber of scientific papers<br />\npublished per capita. Graduates<br />\nof Israeli universities are<br />\nemployed by the world's best<br />\nresearch<br />\nand<br />\nacademic<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nSpeakers from seven of these<br />\nuniversities and institutions<br />\ngathered on April 6th to celebrate<br />\nIsrael's 40 years of scientific<br />\nachievement. Their areas of<br />\nfrom<br />\nspecialty<br />\nranged<br />\n\"Agriculture in the Negev\" and<br />\n\"Life in the Dead Sea\" to<br />\n\"NMR in Biology and<br />\nMedicine\" and \"Inertial Navigation of Aerospace Systems.\"<br />\nMedicine and Biotechnology<br />\nOn the topic of biotechnology,<br />\ntwo speakers discussed various<br />\naspects of Israel's contribution to<br />\nthe field. Professor Gil Navon of<br />\nTel Aviv University, a visiting<br />\nscientist at the National Institute<br />\nof Health (NIH) spoke on the<br />\nbiomedical applications of<br />\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance<br />\n(NMR). At first, Navon reviewed the basis of NMR. He explained that NMR initially only<br />\ndetected interactions between<br />\nhydrogen atoms. Recently,<br />\nhowever, in Israel, techniques<br />\nhave been developed to detect<br />\nbiologically important atoms such<br />\nas phosphorus.<br />\nNavon emphasized the practical uses of NMR. He discussed<br />\nhow data obtained from NMR<br />\ncan be processed to give a clear<br />\npicture of the brain. This tecnhique, which in the U.S. is known<br />\nas Magnetic Resonance Imaging<br />\n(MRI), results in the best resolution, even better than the conventional CAT scan. MRI is widely<br />\nused today to detect brain abnormalities and tumors.<br />\nAnother speaker, Dr. Stephan<br />\nRokem, described \"Israel's<br />\nresearch and development of old<br />\nand new compounds for<br />\nmedicine, food, and agriculture.\"<br />\n<br />\nRokem, a microbiologist at<br />\nHebrew University, is currently<br />\na visiting professor at Yale. He<br />\nbegan by defining biotechnology<br />\nand discussing its origins.<br />\nRokem says, biotechnology is<br />\n\"the use of cells or parts thereof<br />\nfor the production of useful<br />\nmaterials.\" Biotech is nothing<br />\nnew, according to Rokem, as the<br />\nEgyptians used microorganisms<br />\nsuch as yeast to ferment wine and<br />\nbread as early as 4000 years ago.<br />\nThis is known as \"classical<br />\nbiotechnology.\" More recently,<br />\n\"modern<br />\nsays,<br />\nRokem<br />\nbiotechnology\" began in 1916. In<br />\n1916, Chaim Weizmann, later to<br />\nbecome President of Israel, was<br />\nliving in England. He patented a<br />\nmethod for the fermentation of<br />\nacetone butanot. This development was important because<br />\nacetone was useful in the British<br />\nwar effort. Rokem credited Weizmann's discovery as an inspiration behind the Balfour Declaration, which in 1917 affirmed the<br />\nright of the Jewish people to a national homeland in Palestine.<br />\n\"New biotechnology\" was<br />\nushered in 1975, claims Rokem,<br />\nwith the development of the<br />\nfollowing techniques: \"Recombinant DNA (genetic engineering),<br />\nmonoclonal antibodies, enzyme<br />\nand protein engineering, and<br />\nbiosensers.\" Biosensers are enzymes used to measure components such as sugars inside the<br />\nbody, with the removal of<br />\nmaterial from the body.<br />\nThe industries that benefit from<br />\nthe new biotechnology are varied.<br />\nThe chemical industry has<br />\ndiscovered new sources of<br />\nenergy. Biodegradable fibers<br />\nhave been developed. These<br />\nfibers permit surgical sutures to<br />\ndissolve soon after surgery.<br />\nRokem also discussed the<br />\npossibilties of biodegradable containers, and perhaps one day,<br />\ndrinking beer out of edible cans.<br />\nThe medical and health industries have successfully<br />\ndeveloped antiobiotics, and interferon (an agent that fights viral<br />\ninfections) in large quantities. In<br />\naddition, blood products, hormones, vaccines, artificial skin,<br />\nand immune regulators :save been<br />\nformed. In the field of<br />\nagriculture, improved techniques<br />\nin plant breeding, growth of plants<br />\nand animals, and pest control<br />\nhave all come about as a result of<br />\nbiotechnology. Certain plants<br />\nproduce compounds important to<br />\nmedicine. An example is vinblastine, which is used to treat<br />\nleukemia. Due to the small quantities of these drugs available,<br />\nthey are expensive. By improving<br />\nplant growth, says Rokem, the<br />\namount of these drugs will increase, resulting in more drugs<br />\navailable at lower prices.<br />\nTo complete his lecture,<br />\nRokem discussed some of the<br />\nresearch that Israeli scientists<br />\nhave pioneered. Researchers at<br />\nthe Weizmann Institute have<br />\ndiscovered the mechanism of interferon's action. Other scientists<br />\nat the Hebrew University have<br />\nbeen successful in incorporating<br />\nforeign DNA into cells that have<br />\n<br />\npreviously resisted such attempts.<br />\nCurrent research includes an egg<br />\nyolk extract, now being tested in<br />\nthe US, that has proven effective<br />\nagainst the AIDS virus.<br />\nArchaeology<br />\nArchaeology in Israel is \"an indication of what we can learn<br />\nfrom the past for the future,\"<br />\nasserts Dr. Avner Raban. Raban<br />\nis the chairman of the Center for<br />\nMarine Studies at Haifa University and a visiting professor at<br />\nHarvard. He discussed the<br />\nmysteries of the coastal Mediterranean in a lecture entitled \"Ancient Harbors for Modern<br />\nArTechnology\u2014Marine<br />\nchaeology in Israel.\" Raban explained how modern technology<br />\nhas aided scientists in their<br />\ndiscoveries of ancient villages<br />\nunder the Mediterranean.<br />\nThe erosion of coastline over<br />\nthousands of years had created<br />\ndangerous conditions for coastal<br />\ncities. Israeli engineers solved<br />\nthis problem by bringing ashore<br />\nsand from the depths. The<br />\ntransfer of sand uncovered the ancient villages. Raban claims that<br />\nthe sand preserved the artifacts<br />\nextremely well by absorbing the<br />\nstresses and impact of the sea and<br />\nnormal<br />\nby<br />\npreventing<br />\ndeterioration.<br />\n4<br />\nAmong the<br />\ninteresting<br />\ndiscoveries that Raban and his<br />\ncolleagues have unearthed are the<br />\nremains of an 8000-year-old<br />\nskeleton, the \"earliest diver,\" as<br />\nRaban calls it. The structure of<br />\nthe ear bones indicate a pressure<br />\ndifference between the inside and<br />\noutside, characteristic of divers.<br />\nOf the 16 skeletons found, six<br />\nshare this structure.<br />\nRaban's group has also<br />\ndiscovered the walls of villages<br />\nnow submerged after thousands<br />\nof years. The walls represent the<br />\nengineering sophistication of the<br />\nancient builders. Their existence<br />\ntoday is a testimony to the integrity of the ancient structures, Raban<br />\nsays. He adds that the walls are<br />\nmade up of \"well-cut stones,\"<br />\nand that only 5 percent of the surface faced the sea, while the rest<br />\nwas found inside the block. When<br />\nthe waves would crash against the<br />\nwall, they would be sucked back<br />\nout, minimizing the impact of the<br />\nwave. Raban emphasized this<br />\nengineering feat by stating that<br />\nsimilar walls built 20-25 years<br />\nago are deteriorating already.<br />\nAlso fascinating was Raban's<br />\ndescription of the construction of<br />\nancient undersea breakwaters at<br />\nCaesaria. Scientists have<br />\nevidence that the blocks were<br />\nconstructed while they were<br />\nalready underwater. Thorough<br />\nanalysis of the block's composition lead to the following<br />\nhypothesis, as elucidated by<br />\nRaban. The wooden scaffolding<br />\nfor the wall was built onshore.<br />\nThen, cement, composed of 40<br />\npercent ash from Mount Vesuvius,<br />\nwas poured into holes.

According to Dr. Neil MacDonald,<br />\na certified physical therapist and<br />\noperational manager of sports<br />\nmedicine at Union Memorial<br />\nHospital, there is no true<br />\nsubspecialty in medical school for<br />\nthis field. Individuals often<br />\nreceive training after medical<br />\nschool from specialty programs<br />\nsponsored through fellowships;<br />\nthese programs last some six<br />\nmonths to one year. At Union<br />\nMemorial, the trainee spends his<br />\ntime predominantly with a sports<br />\nmedicine physician, learning to<br />\ntreat the injuries suffered by<br />\nathletes.<br />\nAlthough this field may have<br />\njust recently emerged, a common<br />\nbackground is often shared by individuals interested in sports<br />\nmedicine. Many have experience<br />\nin orthopedics and find the transition to this health profession<br />\nrather natural. Recently,<br />\nhowever, sports medicine has<br />\ngrown and established itself in<br />\nmany health-related fields, rang<br />\ning from family practice to cardiology. In Dr. MacDonald's<br />\nwords, \"so much is preventative. . .it is necessary to work<br />\nwith family and children with<br />\n<br />\nsports related injury.\" Therefore,<br />\nthe spread of sports medicine into family practice was inevitable.<br />\nThe impression that one may<br />\nhave when talking about sports<br />\nmedicine is the repair of torn<br />\nligaments, stretched tendons or<br />\nankle injuries. Although this field<br />\nmay be new and case studies concerning the surgical procedures<br />\nhave not yet reached the journals<br />\nof medicine, sports medicine has<br />\nutilized current techniques, in<br />\nparticular arthroscopic surgery.<br />\nA small opening is introduced<br />\nin the damaged region, be it a<br />\nknee, hip, or ankle, and the<br />\nnecessary repairs are made with<br />\n\"minimal invasiveness of procedure.\" Such surgical techniques comprise only one out of<br />\nevery fifteen individuals with a<br />\nsports-related injury. Much of<br />\nsports medicine is preventative as<br />\nwell. Union Memorial Hospital<br />\nplaces individuals on exercise<br />\nprograms to prevent unnecessary<br />\ninjuries from occurring. Health<br />\nproblems related to athletics often<br />\ncan be categorized in one group,<br />\n\"overuse.\" The muscle pain or<br />\nswollen ankle occurs in people<br />\n\"doing too much, too often, too<br />\nfast.\" Dr. MacDonald gives the<br />\nexample of females who wish to<br />\nlose weight for the coming spring<br />\nand decide to run a mile or two.<br />\nAfter two or three nights, they<br />\nmay feel pain from overuse; the<br />\n<br />\nbody has just not been able to<br />\nadapt so quickly.

Then, with 5:4(i<br />\nleft, a goal by Carolina attackman<br />\nMichael Thomas, a freshman out<br />\nof Baltimore's Boys' Latin High<br />\nSchool, moved the Tar Heels<br />\nwithin one.

He had just put together<br />\nan impressive 1987 campaign,<br />\nfinishing 10-5 and ranked seventh<br />\nin the nation. Though he lost<br />\nsome key players, including<br />\nAll-American<br />\nsecond-team<br />\ndefenseman Tom Hickman, he<br />\nreturned his top scorer in Bob<br />\nBetchley and one of the nation's<br />\ntop goalies in Tom Portuese. His<br />\nCadets were ranked number<br />\ntwelve in the preseason polls, and<br />\nopened with two victories. But<br />\nthen everything seemed to come<br />\napart.<br />\nThe collapse began on March<br />\n13, when the Cadets faced the<br />\nhighly-touted Big Red at Cornell.<br />\nDown 9-6 at the three minute<br />\nmark, Army rallied to put a scare<br />\ninto last year's NCAA runnerup. Tom Desperito scored his second goal of the game with 2:34<br />\nto play, and when Betchley tallied<br />\nonly 26 seconds later, it appeared<br />\nthat the Cadest might pull off the<br />\nupset. Though Cornell held off<br />\nthe rally for a 9-8 win, Coach<br />\nErnmer had to be pleased with his<br />\nteam's performance, especially<br />\nPortuese, who sparkled with<br />\ntwenty saves.<br />\n<br />\nThe following week, however,<br />\nnot even Portuese was on. Army<br />\nwas completely dominated 15-4<br />\nby Brown in a game that should<br />\nhave been much closer. The only bright spot for the Cadets was<br />\nBob Betchley, who continued his<br />\nquest to duplicate his 42 goal and<br />\n21 assist performance of last<br />\nseason with three more goals. He<br />\ngot four more in the Carrier<br />\nDome on March 26, but the<br />\nOrangemen shelled Army 19-8.<br />\nAfter losing three straight<br />\ngames, the schedule provided the<br />\nCadets with a little relief. Army<br />\ncoasted to a victory over<br />\nMichigan State, but then struggled to a mere 5-4 win over a<br />\nhapless Bucknell team. Coach<br />\nEmmer's pre-season optimism<br />\nsurely was rattled, and this was<br />\nthe last thing his team needed as<br />\nthey prepared to face their archrival Navy last week.<br />\nThe Cadets came out fired up<br />\nlast Saturday, as the defense finally lived up to their pre-season<br />\nbilling. Brilliant goal-tending by<br />\nTom Portuese had Army leading<br />\n5-3 entering the fourth quarter.<br />\nNavy, however, refused to be<br />\nupset and quickly tied the score<br />\nat five. When Navy tallied again<br />\nwith 1:32 to play to seal a 6-5 victory, Army was left with a 4-4<br />\n<br />\nrecord heading into the toughest<br />\npart of their schedule.<br />\nArmy will now face three topten teams in seven days, beginning this Saturdsay night in West<br />\nPoint with a 7:00 game against<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Blue Jays. The<br />\nfollowing Wednesday, Army<br />\nfaces the surprising Yale Eli<br />\nbefore next Saturday's showdown<br />\nwith Massachusetts. To turn<br />\nthings around, the Cadets are going to need some outstanding play<br />\nfrom Portuese. Tom had a save<br />\npercentage of 65.3 last season,<br />\nbut he struggled all the way<br />\nwithout Hickman playing in front<br />\nof him. Betchley. Hoynes, and<br />\nDesperito are all capable of scoring a lot of goals, but they need<br />\nsome help from the rest of their<br />\nteammates if they are going to<br />\nstay with teams such as Hopkins.<br />\nRight now, Army is in serious<br />\ndanger of not making the NCAA<br />\nTournament. The Cadets have not<br />\nwon a big game all season, and<br />\ntheir solid performance against<br />\nCornell is no longer as impressive<br />\nwhen you consider that the Big<br />\nRed has dropped to 2-4.

An amazed<br />\nCoach Gary Green said afterwards, \"This is really, really<br />\nunusual, even unbelievable. The<br />\nrecord was really shattered. Sixth<br />\ntenths of a second is a big deal in<br />\na 100 meter dash. What's so funny is that they were in the same<br />\nheat out of four heats for the<br />\ntrials, and they ran the same incredible record-breaking time,<br />\none in lane 1 and one in lane 8.<br />\nI expect this record to last only<br />\na week or so before one or both<br />\nof them rebreaks it.\" He turned<br />\nout to be wrong; it was only four<br />\ndays. Last Wednesday in a trimeet against Division I Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nrivals UMBC and Towson State,<br />\nboth Gifford and Johnson again<br />\nran under their new record, with<br />\nGifford just barely edging<br />\nJohnson out with a time of 12.6.<br />\nThe 200 meter dash record also<br />\nfell on Wednesday when Gifford<br />\nand Johnson, in separate heats,<br />\nboth ran 27.4, just under the old<br />\nrecord of 27.5. Five Lady Jays on<br />\nthis year's team now hold the<br />\nschool records in six events: Gifford in the 100: Gifford, Diana<br />\nLogan, Laura Perlinn, and<br />\nJohnson in the 4 X 100; Perlinn<br />\nin the 400 meter hurdles; Suzi<br />\nMcGinn in the 800; and Johnson<br />\nin the triple jump.<br />\nHopkins did very well as a<br />\nteam on Saturday at the Messiah<br />\nInvitational, placing fifth out of<br />\nfourteen teams with 33 points,<br />\nand qualifying another 7 people<br />\nfor the MAC Championship meet<br />\nin May in 9 events. Johnson was<br />\nthe high scorer for Hopkins, earning 8 points by placing third in<br />\n<br />\nthe triple jump, sixth in the long<br />\njump, and sixth in the 100 meter<br />\ndash; she is now qualified for the<br />\nMAC meet in all three events.<br />\nJohnson also anchored the bronze<br />\nmedal 4 X 100 meter relay team<br />\nof Gifford, Logan, and Perlinn.<br />\nOther point-earners, all of whom<br />\nalso qualified, were McGinn\u2014<br />\nthird place and a bronze medal in<br />\nthe 800, Gifford\u2014fourth place in<br />\nthe 100, Perlinn\u2014fourth place in<br />\nthe 400 meter hurdles, Logan\u2014<br />\nfifth in the 400, Molly Bardsley\u2014<br />\nfifth in the 3000, and Tamsen<br />\nLove\u2014sixth in 5000. Gifford also<br />\nqualified in the long jump and<br />\nAnna Lee Bamforth in the 1500,<br />\nbut they weren't able to score.<br />\nIn the tri-meet last Wednesday,<br />\nApril 13, the women were third<br />\nwith only 38 points, behind<br />\nUMBC's 78 and Towson's 60.<br />\nHopkins finished second in the<br />\nrunning events, but were shut out<br />\nof the shot put, discus, javelin,<br />\nand high jump. The Lady Jays<br />\n<br />\nnetted only ten points in the field<br />\nevents, while UMBC and<br />\nTowson shared the other 56.<br />\nHopkins' only first place came<br />\nfrom senior April Savoye in the<br />\nlong jump, while second places<br />\nwere earned by the 4 X 100 meter<br />\nrelay (Perlinn, McGinn, Savoye,<br />\nand Johnson), the 4 X 400 meter<br />\nrelay (Perlinn, Gifford, Savoye,<br />\nand McGinn), McGinn in the<br />\n800, Perlinn in the 100 and 400<br />\nmeter hurdles, and Johnson in the<br />\ntriple jump. The meet also produced six more qualifying times<br />\nfor Perlinn and Valerie Wilson in<br />\nthe 100 meter hurdles, McGinn in<br />\nthe 400, Gifford and Johnson in<br />\nthe 200, and Bardsley in the<br />\n1500.<br />\nOne reason for the women's<br />\nsudden success is that they are no<br />\nlonger a team of only freshmen<br />\nand sophomores, which has been<br />\nthe status quo for the past few<br />\nyears. The higher number of<br />\ntalented veterans backed by a<br />\n<br />\ngood group of freshmen has made<br />\nit possible for Hopkins to be competitive in every race this year. In<br />\norder to further improve,<br />\nCoaches Green and Simonsick<br />\nhave implemented something new<br />\nto the track program: films.<br />\nEvery race is videotaped, and on<br />\nthe next day, the girls watch their<br />\nprevious performances, looking<br />\nfor weaknesses that can be corrected. The main benefit of the<br />\ntapes is probably for the sprinters<br />\nand jumpers, who can learn from<br />\nwatching relay hand-offs, hurdling and jumping techniques, and<br />\nblock starts. The distance runners<br />\nalso benefit by reviewing race<br />\nstrategy and running form.<br />\nThe Lady Jays travel this Saturday to compete in the Catholic<br />\nUniversity Invitational, but are<br />\nthen home again next Wednesday, April 20 for a tri-meet with<br />\nWestern Maryland and York at 3<br />\npm.<br />\n<br />\nJays tar and feather Heels Danny's Edge<br />\nLAX, from 27<br />\nregular season, but if conditions<br />\nremain the same (if Hopkins and<br />\nSyracuse each win the rest of<br />\ntheir games) the two teams will<br />\nface one another in the finals to<br />\nbe held at Syracuse on Memorial<br />\nDay.<br />\nTo get to Syracuse, the Jays<br />\nwill have to start by beating Army at West Point tomorrow,<br />\nfollowed by a tough Homecoming game the following week<br />\nagainst Maryland.

It came with an<br />\nextra'man advantage. Six minutes<br />\nlater, with less than thirty seconds<br />\nremaining in the first period, the<br />\nJays scored on an extra-man opportunity of their own. Senior attackman Mike Morrill connected<br />\non an assist from junior midfielder Brendan Kelly.<br />\nThis combination represents<br />\ntwo of Hopkins' three top scorers<br />\nof 1988.

DON'T<br />\nOVERSTRETCH.<br />\nCAUTION: Overstretching can<br />\nstrain muscles and lead to delays<br />\nin your workout while you wait<br />\nfor muscles to heal.<br />\nNow that you have loosened<br />\nup, you are ready to start lifting<br />\nweights. Bodybuilding is not an<br />\nexact science. It's pretty much a<br />\nhit and miss affair, at least in the<br />\nbeginning. You can find tons of<br />\nconflicting advice available on the<br />\nsubject. The routine we propose<br />\ncomes from Robert Kennedy<br />\n(editor of Muscle Mag International). Beware of friendly advice. Although well-intentioned,<br />\nthe firmest beliefs are held by<br />\nthose with the least knowledge<br />\n(You could speak to some of our<br />\nTA's.)<br />\nThere are certain guidelines.<br />\nwhich should be followed. Beginners always want the fastest way<br />\nto build muscle and strength.<br />\nOften you end up taking bad advice and doing just the opposite.<br />\nYour progress is slowed and then<br />\nyou get tired and sick of the<br />\nwhole thing. Don't despair.<br />\nRemember the correct way is the<br />\nshortest one. Don't try shortcuts.<br />\nIn the beginning it is relatively<br />\nsimple. The initial workouts<br />\nshould be pretty short so enough<br />\ntime is allowed between workouts<br />\nfor the muscles to recuperate. If<br />\nnot, your torn-down cells won't be<br />\n<br />\nrepaired, and you can end up actually hurting yourself. You must<br />\nalso eat well regularly and get<br />\nenough sleep. If you are on the<br />\nmeal plan, my sympathy'.<br />\nOne thing you should consider<br />\ndoing is getting a check up. This<br />\nis the same for any sport requiring heavy exercise. You might<br />\nhave a heart condition or<br />\nsomething that could only be<br />\nlifting.<br />\nby<br />\ncomplicated<br />\nRemember you're doing this for<br />\nyour body so don't take any<br />\nchances with it. (Same for you<br />\nwho just want a better sex life.)<br />\nThose beginning to lift should<br />\nstart off on the Nautilus equipment. The reason for this is that<br />\nthe muscles in your body are not<br />\nprepared for the excessive strain<br />\nthat free weights can cause. The<br />\nNautilus machines allow controlled movements which lead to the<br />\nproper technique needed when<br />\nfree weights are used. They also<br />\ncondition your muscles properly<br />\nand provide a base on which to<br />\nbuild.<br />\nStart slowly. This can't be emphasized enough. Decide on what<br />\npart of your body you wish to<br />\nbuild. For a complete workout<br />\ndesign a schedule. A suggestion<br />\nis to use a four day schedule (ex:<br />\nMonday, Tuesday, Thursday,<br />\nand Friday). Work on chest,<br />\nshoulders, traps, and triceps one<br />\nday and biceps, back and legs<br />\nanother. Stomach exercises<br />\nshould be done at least four times<br />\na week. Another thing before we<br />\nstart: decide what you want to get<br />\nout of your training. Do you want<br />\nbuild or strength or both?<br />\nFor build, you should stay with<br />\nlighter weight and do as many<br />\nrepetitions as you can up to<br />\ntwelve and then increase weights<br />\nuntil you can only do two reps.<br />\nThis technique is called<br />\npyramiding and works if done<br />\nproperly. Always do a warmdown set or two, making your last<br />\nwarm-down set equal to or lessthan your starting weight. A good<br />\nway to decide if you need to start<br />\nwith heavier weights is if you can<br />\ndo twelve reps with no strain.<br />\nFor strength, you should use<br />\nheavier weights and fewer reps<br />\nup to the point where you can't<br />\nlift anymore. A mixture of these<br />\ntwo techniques is ideal for a<br />\nsocially acceptable body. In each<br />\ncase you should work your<br />\nmuscles to the MMF point. This<br />\nis the Maximum Muscle Fatigue<br />\npoint where they feel tight and<br />\nyou just can't lift anymore.<br />\nOkay. Now for the exercises.<br />\nRemember: when using free<br />\nweights always use a spotter.<br />\nMany mishaps resulting in injury<br />\nhave occurred to those who<br />\nthought they were too good for a<br />\nspotter. While they are recovering, you could pass them up in<br />\nweights by simply asking<br />\nsomebody, \"Could you spot<br />\nme?\" They will be glad to.<br />\nDAY 1:<br />\nChest:<br />\n1.

Marean<br />\nscored sixteen points, over half of<br />\nthe men's total of 28, who finished sixth overall in a field of fifteen. Besides Marean, no other<br />\nrunner was able to place. The<br />\nother twelve points came from the<br />\nfield events, as Tom Brennan<br />\nplaced fourth in the pole vault<br />\nwith an MAC-qualifying height<br />\nof 12 feet, Eric Hastings placed<br />\nfifth in the shotput and javelin,<br />\n<br />\nand Glenn Sabin placed fourth in<br />\nthe shot put.<br />\nLast Wednesday, April 13, the<br />\nmen finished second in their trimeet with 49 points, far behind<br />\nTowson (98 points) and barely<br />\nahead of UMBC (40 points). In<br />\nthe running events, Hopkins earned only one first place from<br />\nMarean in the 5000, and had second places from Paul Park in the<br />\n400 meter dash and Matt Hannon<br />\nin the 400 meter hurdles. The<br />\nJays got half of their total points<br />\nfrom their two outstanding<br />\nfreshmen throwers, Hastings and<br />\nSabin. Hastings placed first in the<br />\ndiscus, second in the shotput,<br />\nthird in the javelin, and third in<br />\nthe triple jump, while Sabin plac-<br />\n<br />\ned first in the javelin, third in the<br />\nshotput, and third in the discus.<br />\nMax Psolka contributed six points<br />\nwith second place finishes in the<br />\ntriple and high jump.

Fortsch<br />\nThe resignation of John DiLeo<br />\nfrom the position of director of<br />\nthe Hopkins Organization for<br />\nProgramming was the main topic<br />\nof discussion at Wednesday<br />\nnight's Student Council meeting.<br />\nPresident Scott FitzGerald began<br />\nthe meeting with the announcement that sophomore Unice<br />\nLieberman will be replacing<br />\nDiLeo. DiLeo's resignation was<br />\nprompted by a threat of impeachment from the Student Council on<br />\nthe grounds that DiLeo missed<br />\ntoo many meetings. FitzGerald<br />\nnoted that this instance was the<br />\nfirst effective use of the Council's<br />\nattendance policy.<br />\nThe Council next discussed the<br />\nSAC seals that accompany<br />\ngraduates' degrees. Each year,<br />\nstudents nominate those seniors<br />\nwho they think have made a<br />\nsignficant contribution to the<br />\nHopkins community. Nominations are made by submitting<br />\nnames to the Student Activities<br />\nOffice, where the selection process takes place. Following this<br />\nprocedure, the Student Council<br />\nvotes on and approves the list of<br />\nnames submitted by the Student<br />\nActivities Commission.<br />\nThe controversy centers around<br />\nthe selection process, in which<br /><br />\nmany of the nominations are<br />\nthrown out by the SAC board,<br />\npotentially hurting some students'<br />\nfeelings.<br />\nFitzGerald explained that the<br />\nCouncil, as in the past, does not<br />\nwish to get in the middle of this<br />\ndispute and would rather not consider it. After the meeting, many<br />\nofficers expressed the need for an<br />\nimprovement of the selection process itself.<br />\nCouncil also discussed recent<br />\nsanctions against the Sigma Phi<br />\nEpsilon and Tau Epsilon Phi<br />\nfraternities, as well as current<br />\nissues about Greek life at<br />\nHopkins. Steve Basta, former<br />\npresident of the Interfraternity<br />\nCouncil, was present at the<br />\nmeeting to give a brief statement<br />\nand answer questions.<br />\nBasta explained that the fraternities' national organiations<br />\nbrought actions against Sig Ep<br />\nand TEP.

Basta<br />\nnoted that former Sig Ep brothers<br />\nwill probably not be able to apply for readmission.<br />\nSig Ep's temporary closing was<br />\ncaused by poor management and<br />\nfinancial problems, while TEP's<br />\nsuspension was provoked by an<br />\nincident that occurred during this<br /><br />\nyear's pledge period in which a<br />\npledge placed his hands on a<br />\nwoman's breasts as he interpreted<br />\nthe instructions of his pledge task.<br />\nDuring the meeting, FitzGerald<br />\nalso announced and congratulated<br />\nthis year's Young Trustee,<br />\nStephanie Weissman, vice president of the Student Council.<br />\nAlso at the meeting:<br />\nFitzGerald asked for class<br />\nrepresentatives to speak on upcoming events.<br />\nThe senior class is sponsoring<br />\na \"blow-out picnic\" for the Class<br />\nof 1988 on May 22, while the<br />\njunior class is preparing a dunking booth for Spring Fair.<br />\nOn April 21, the sophomore<br />\nclass is having a barbecue party.<br />\nThe freshmen class announced its<br />\nplans for an end-of-the-year party on April 29.

Lee Davis<br /><br />\nNot a Good Year for Nat Sci<br />\nAcademic adviser James Goodyear provided the News-Letter with an article this<br />\nweek which discusses the new requirements<br />\nfor the Natural Sciences area major.<br />\nGoodyear stresses that, because the new requirements make the major more difficult<br />\nto complete, it is important for science majors to plan their four-year schedule in<br />\nadvance.<br />\nHe's not kidding. The new requirements<br />\nfor the major make it as difficult to complete as the department science majors, requiring more upper-level science courses<br />\nthan were previously necessary. That's<br />\nfine\u2014after all, a major in the sciences<br />\nshould mean that the majority of courses<br />\ntaken are science courses. But<br />\nwait. . .there's more!<br />\nNatural science and biology majors (the<br />\nmajority of whom are premeds) take<br />\nMolecular Cell Biology(MCB)as their first<br />\nbiology course. Since this course requires<br />\nIntroductory and Organic Chemistry as<br />\nprerequisites, MCB is traditionally taken<br />\nduring the spring of sophomore and junior<br />\nyears. During this second semester, most<br />\nstudents then take the first oftwo semesters<br />\nof General Physics. Short of loading up on<br />\ntop of these classes, the students are leftwith three semesters to complete their<br />\nupper-level science courses. Until now, this<br />\nhas not been such a bad thing, since two<br />\nsemesters of MCB fulfilled eight of the 15<br />\nupper-level courses needed.<br />\nAccording to the changes, however,<br />\nMCB no longer fulfills upper-level science<br />\ncredit, even though it is a rigorous,<br />\n300-level course. And because it is a prere-<br /><br />\nquisite for all other upper-level biologyrelated courses, the average natural<br />\nsciences student will not begin to fulfill<br />\nupper-level coursework until the second<br />\nsemester of their junior year. This results<br />\nin heavy courseloads all through junior and<br />\nsenior year\u2014the time during which many<br />\nstudents would prefer to concentrate on<br />\nMCAT review and medical school<br />\napplications.<br />\nThe MCAT brings up another point. The<br />\npremed schedule leaves students grotesquely unprepared for the biology portion of the<br />\nMCAT. Much of this test deals with<br />\nphysiology and some genetics\u2014topics<br />\nwhich are not covered by MCB. There is<br />\nno introductory level biology course required of the science majors. The<br />\nbiophysics department offer a physiology<br />\ncourse every two years, so the student who<br />\nplans wisely can anticipate this class. The<br />\nclass is one lecture taught at both the 100and 300- levels. While the 100-level course<br />\nis fine for non-science majors, it fulfills no<br />\nrequirement for the science major. The<br />\n300-level course does, but\u2014surprise\u2014it has<br />\nMCB as a prerequisite!<br />\nThe natural sciences major is thus no<br />\nbargain. Students who want plenty of<br />\nscience may as well enjoy the benefits of<br />\nthe departmental programs. Those who<br />\nwant only to prepare for medical school<br />\nshould follow Goodyear's advice and look<br />\noutside of the sciences for majors. This<br />\nalternative may the best one yet, since it<br />\nallows premeds to fulfill medical school requirements while concentrating in other<br />\nfields entirely.<br /><br />\nMlbe Party'<br />\nThere was a headline that ran a tew years<br />\nago in this newspaper for a 'spring fair update' article which read \"Spring Fair: No<br />\nConcert; No 10K Run.\" It's a dangerous<br />\nprecedent to start commenting on the work<br />\nof previous News-Letter staffs\u2014surely it<br />\ncan only come back to haunt us\u2014but the<br />\nsentiment behind the headline misses an important point.<br />\nSpring Fair is a celebration of the season,<br />\nbut really it celebrates Hopkins and its<br />\nstudents. Student organization and participation creates activities and infuses a<br />\nvitality which makes Fair far more than<br />\nsimply an arts and crafts showcase; we<br />\nopen the doors of our campus to Baltimore<br />\nand beyond for a three day festival.<br />\nAdmittedly, the lack of a concert and a<br />\n10k run were regrettable shortcomings that<br />\nyear. This should not have supplanted the<br />\noverwhelmingly positive nature of the Fair.<br />\nLooking at this year's Fair, it has all of<br />\nwhat we've come to expect and more. The<br /><br />\ntellenb<br /><br />\nconcert is featuring The BoDeans, one of<br />\nAmericas hottest new bands. There will indeed be a road race again, along with performances by other bands, student and professional, fair games, a car show, and<br />\nChester Wickwire's dog show. Corresponding to the liberty theme, the Old Guard<br />\nFife and Drum Corps will perfor. Our tricornered hats go off to the chairmen who<br />\ncreatively and diligently worked to make<br />\nthe fair better than ever.<br />\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when<br />\npeople would look to Fair and say: \"This<br />\nis the one thing that Hopkins does right.\"<br />\nIt would be a mistake, looking at other successful social ventures such as Hoppy<br />\nHour, or the recent FIJI Islander, to say this<br />\nis still true. Nevertheless, Spring Fair remains Hopkins students' largest<br />\nendeavor\u2014achieving consistently successful results. With this year promising to<br />\nbe no exception, we hope everyone can<br />\nhave a blast this weekend.<br /><br />\nSeveral weeks ago, I was embroiled in a little debate with one<br />\nof my G.W. Whiting School<br />\nfriends. He held that spoken and<br />\nwritten languages should be done<br />\naway with, that they are inefficient and confusing at best,<br />\nand\u2014because of the possibility<br />\nthat certain situations could be<br />\nmisconstrued\u2014dangerous at<br />\nworst. The only way, the best<br />\nway, according to my friend, to<br />\ncommunicate is with mathematical symbols and equations. Of<br />\ncourse, there is beauty in a wellturned phrase, he said, but there<br />\nis just as much elegance in a<br />\nlogical proof, or a wellformulated equation. Newton's<br />\nlaws and Maxwell's equations<br />\ndon't just give us a slice of life,<br />\nas most litereature does; but<br />\nrather, they describe, encompass,<br />\nin a sense, life itself. They are the<br />\npith, the essential element of<br />\nhuman knowledge. After equations, literature is a johnny-comelately, excess baggage we've accumulated over the years.<br />\nTechnology has now allowed us<br />\nto do away with it if we so<br />\nchoose.<br />\nHe was originally from India,<br />\nand lamented how much confusion was caused by the language<br />\nbarrier. If everyone put their<br />\nideas across in numbers, without<br />\nnuances<br />\npotential<br />\nor<br />\nmisunderstanding, the world<br />\nwould be a better place. Foreign<br />\nrelations would be cut and dried.<br />\nI rose to the defense of my<br />\ncraft. Sure, I said, you could<br />\ncommunicate quite well with<br />\nequations, but the intelligent mind<br />\neschews routine. If one and only<br /><br />\none equation equalled one idea<br />\n(the expected conclusion of his<br />\nreductionism), so-called \"communication\" would be stilted indeed. How could one communicate feelings\u2014the joy of<br />\nreceiving an acceptance into college, the disbelieving horror<br />\nwhich follows a car accident\u2014<br />\nwith equations? Would one just<br />\nstate the equation which translates<br />\nto \"I am happy,\" or \"I am<br />\nscared\"? Somehow, the true state<br />\nof mind doesn't come across, and<br />\nin that sense, communicating by<br />\nnumbers would be less accurate.<br />\nIf all he were concerned about<br />\nwas having a universal language,<br />\nI urged him to join an Esperanto<br />\nlobby group.<br />\n\"Next time you're having a<br />\nproblem getting an idea across,<br />\nremember what I said,\" he concluded. I considered his project in<br />\ndepth.

Suddenly, it didn't<br />\nseem like such a bad idea.<br />\nI thought of how much money<br />\ncould be saved by schools across<br />\nthe nation. They could cut out<br />\nEnglish and social studies classes<br />\nand have those teachers cook<br />\nsome real food for the kids. The<br />\nSAT and GRE scores would only be out of 800.

Presently I am majoring in both Electrical/Computer<br />\nEngineering and Writing<br />\nSeminars, and although I plan to<br />\ncontinue writing, the EE program<br />\n,just has to go.<br />\nI am still a practical person. I<br />\nrealize that Writing Seminars will<br />\nnot likely lead me to a job with<br />\ngreat pay or much prestige, so I<br />\nintend to maintain a double with<br />\nsome other major. Many people<br />\nconsider Writing Seminars an<br />\n\"easy degree,\" and it can be, but<br />\nit's more what the individual<br />\nchooses to make of it. Certain<br />\ndepartments at Hopkins have very<br />\nflexible requirements, and<br />\nalthough this has its merits, I<br />\nbelieve people can graduate with<br />\na Writing Seminars degree with<br />\nlittle effort and little learned, but<br />\nit doesn't have to be that way.<br />\nBut I come here not to praise<br />\nEngineering, but to bury him.<br />\nCertainly, part of the problem is<br />\nme. I seem to be very good at<br />\nwhatever it is that we engineersin-training are supposed to learn,<br />\nbut I'm not really interested in the<br />\nwork, and as such, I tend to be<br />\nrather sloppy about it. This is no<br />\nway to go about a career.<br />\nBut part of the problem is the<br />\nfaculty and the organization of the<br />\nschool. Every single professor involved in the engineering department has either displayed a blatant disinterest in undergraduates<br /><br />\nnities since the early 1980s,(vis.,<br />\nexcessive drinking, pledge hazing, and female abuse). Burcham<br />\nagrees that these problems do exist at some universities and that<br />\nthe problems should be publicized. However, she contends that<br />\nthe publication of such Greek<br />\ncriticism \"without running a corresponding article which<br />\ndiscusses the benefits and positive<br />\naspects of fraternity behavior is<br />\nnot only misleading but also unfair,\" especially to Hopkins<br />\nfraternities and sororities. When<br />\nconsidering Burcham's argument, one might wish to visualize<br />\nWoodward and Bernstein<br />\nfeverishly working to write a<br />\npositive article on the Nixon Administration so that it could run<br />\nnext to their latest unflattering<br />\npiece on the Watergate affair.<br />\nIn the name of \"fairplay,\"<br />\nshould the News-Letter publish an<br />\n\"anti-Greek\" article everytime it<br />\nreports on a positive aspect of the<br />\nGreek system? If all News-Letter<br />\narticles which expressed an opinion on any subject had to be accompanied by an article with the<br />\nopposing view(s), the NewsLetter would be sixty pages thick<br />\nand would appear monthly. Burcham's absurdly impractical<br />\nargument for equal coverage<br />\nnecessitates<br />\nno<br />\nfurther<br />\nbelaboring.<br />\nBurcham also claims that the<br />\narticle in question presents a<br />\ndisturbing and inaccurate picture<br />\nof Hopkins fraternities to faculty, administration, et al. This<br /><br />\nor at least, total ignorance of the<br />\nrest of the school.<br />\nWhen I first spoke to my<br />\nengineering advisor, I asked him<br />\nabout math placement. Not only<br />\ncould he tell me nothing about the<br />\nrequirements<br />\nmathematics<br />\nbeyond the credits enumerated in<br />\nthe curricula guide, but he was<br />\nhard pressed to tell me in which<br />\nbuilding I might find the math<br />\ndepartment to ask someone. One<br />\nwould think that when the success<br />\nof engineering students is<br />\nnecessarily based on their<br />\nmathematial background, the<br />\nengineering faculty would show<br />\nmore interest.<br />\nFormer Writing Seminars<br />\nundergraduate advisor Robert<br />\nArellano was so well loved<br />\nbecause of the individual attention<br />\nsingle<br />\nevery<br />\nhe<br />\ngave<br />\nundergraduate with which he was<br />\nconcerned. He remembered each<br />\none personally. If we could expect half of that devotion to the<br />\nundergraduate engineering<br />\nstudents by faculty, the department would be all the better. Dr.<br />\nBob was a fantastic advisor, but<br />\nhe was not necessarily atypical of<br />\nHopkins.

The article is unquestionably accurate to the extent that<br />\nsome (if not most) of the problems mentioned in the article<br />\nhave been experienced here at<br />\nHopkins. (As stated above, the<br />\narticle does not pretend to offer<br />\na irue reflection of all fraternities.) If Burcham measures<br />\nfairness in terms of equal<br />\ncoverage of opposing views, I<br />\nhope that the next time she<br />\ndecides to \"blow Phi Mu's horn\"<br />\nshe includes a laundry list of Phi<br />\nMu's misdeeds. Articles such as<br />\nthe one published two weeks ago<br />\ndo not provide opponents of<br />\nfraternities with additional fire<br />\nagainst them (as Burcham would<br />\nhave us believe).

First,<br />\nseeing that the referenced article<br />\ndoes not in any way indict, or<br />\neven mention, Hopkins fraternities, any disfavorable opinions<br />\nformed by the faculty and administration from reading the article must find their basis in<br />\ndisturbing events that have occurred at Hopkins parallel to those<br />\ncited in the article. It follows,<br />\nthen that if the article is inaccurate in its applicability to the<br />\nHopkins Greek system, neither<br />\nfaculty nor administration will<br />\nconjure up a disturbing picture of<br />\nHopkins fraternities. Does the article accurately depict some of the<br />\nproblems which the Hopkins<br />\nGreek system has recently encountered? Perhaps. Perhaps not.<br />\nWithin the last few weeks two<br />\nHopkins fraternities have been<br />\ndisciplined by their national<br />\norganizations, one for female<br />\nabuse.<br />\nThe article does not claim to be<br />\nan accurate representation of the<br />\nbehavior of all fraternities nationwide, but only seeks to present an<br />\noverview of some of the recent<br />\nproblems arising from Greek<br />\n\"misbehavior.\"<br />\nThe purpose of my letter is not<br />\nto disparage fraternities in<br />\ngeneral, nor the Hopkins Greek<br />\nsystem in particular, but rather to<br />\ntake exception with Burcham's<br />\nposition that the April 1st issue<br />\narticle dealing with Greek<br />\nmisdeeds is an unfair and inaccurate depiction of Hopkins<br /><br />\nblue physics type or are quite<br />\nsatisfied with biology, this state<br />\nof affairs is no big deal. But if you<br />\nare still shopping around for your<br />\nacademic niche or if you might le<br />\nconsidering graduating a semester<br />\nearly, then be aware that the new<br />\nrequirements for the natural<br />\nsciences area major have changed and have become quite<br />\ndemanding.<br />\nFor some time, faculty in the<br />\nnatural sciences departments<br />\nwere concerned that this area major was not sufficiently rigorous.<br />\nThey felt that the requirement of<br />\n\"at least 40 credits for courses<br />\ncoded (N), to include at least one<br />\nyear of chemistry with laboratory<br />\nand one year of physics with<br />\nlaboratory, and a minimum of 15<br />\n(N)credits for study at or beyond<br />\nthe 300 level, not including<br />\nresearch, internships or independent study credits\" was both too<br />\nmodest and too easy to<br />\nmanipulate. And they were right,<br />\npartly because the guidelines did<br />\nnot exclude 300-level labs from<br />\nmeeting requirements and partly because Hopkins does not offer a year-long introductory<br />\nbiology course with lab. So,<br />\nthrough this year, a student who<br />\nfulfilled medical school prerequisites of a year of biology and<br />\nlab could count both semesters of<br />\nmolecular cell biology and lab\u2014a<br />\ntotal of 12-14 credits\u2014toward the<br />\n15 (N) credits at or beyond the<br />\n300 level required for the natural<br />\nsciences area.<br />\nWhether or not this meant the<br />\nnatural sciences area major was<br />\ntoo \"easy\" and called for<br />\n\"toughening up\" is debatable.<br />\nPerhaps what was needed was<br /><br />\ncloser faculty advising to insure<br />\nthat students maintained rigorous<br />\nprograms. Or maybe the addition<br />\nto the curriculum of a biology<br />\ncourse akin to introductory<br />\nchemistry or physics would have<br />\nsufficiently strengthened the major. These are moot points,<br />\nbecause the requirements were<br />\nchanged to the following:<br />\n(I)One year of introductory<br />\nchemistry<br />\nplus<br />\nlab.<br />\nOne year of general physics plus<br />\nlab.<br />\nOne<br />\nyear<br />\nof calculus.<br />\n(2)20 credits of introductory<br />\nand/or upper-level science and<br />\nmathematics.<br />\n(Premedical<br />\nstudents would normally take one<br />\nyear of organic chemistry with<br />\nlab and one year of biology with<br />\nlab.)<br />\n(3)Five one-semester courses at<br />\nthe 300 level (totalling at least 15<br />\ncredits). These can be divided at<br />\nmost between two departments.<br />\nThree of the courses must be in<br />\neither biology, chemistr)<br />\nphysics, biophysics, or earth and<br />\nplanetary sciences. However, no<br />\ncourses used to satisfy requirement(2)can be used to fulfill this<br />\nrequirement. Also, no labs, independent study, research, or<br />\ntutorials can count toward upperlevel science courses.<br />\n(4)A minimum of 30 H/S credits<br />\nto include at least five courses at<br />\nor beyond the 300 level. These<br />\n300-level courses have to total at<br />\nleast 15 credits and can be taken<br />\nin, at most, three different departments.

For example, Bow uoin College President<br />\nA. LeRoy Greason chose to<br />\ndescribe fraternities today as<br />\n\"social centers without any very<br />\nclear purpose.\" While this sadly<br />\nmay be the case at his institution,<br />\nthe first sentence in this<br />\nparagraph clearly shows he is<br />\nlacking the benefit of a broad<br />\nperspective.<br />\nThe fraternity and sorority<br />\nmembers at Hopkins participate<br />\nin many activities, the overwhelming majority of which<br />\nbenefit the Hopkins community<br />\nand the neighborhoods of<br />\nBaltimore. But it is only when we<br />\nscrew up that the press chooses to<br />\nrecognize us at all. The unfortunate incident at TEP and those<br />\nexamples cited in the past two<br />\nNews-Letters are prime examples<br />\nof this. If fraternities make such<br />\ninteresting news, why are there<br />\nnot articles about our volunteer<br />\nwork for charities or the Dean of<br />\nStudents-sponsored, educational<br />\nprograms run by the IFC? The<br />\nNews-Letter consistently ignores<br />\nthe progress made by the IFC in<br />\neducating and policing its<br />\nmembership. I doubt that there<br />\nare any student groups on this<br />\ncampus who seek to educate and<br />\ntake responsibility for the actions<br />\nof their members as diligently as<br />\nthe IFC. I am not suggesting that<br />\nthe News-Letter refrain from<br />\nprinting articles of interest but<br />\nthat the staff realize that there are<br />\ntwo sides to a story and that each<br />\nside deserves equal coverage.<br />\nFor the sake of fairness and accuracy in reporting, it is about<br />\ntime you recognize the Greek<br />\nSystem at Hopkins for what it is:<br />\nthe associations of men and<br />\nwomen united to enjoy and reap<br />\nthe rewards of brotherhood and<br /><br />\nsisterhood. For those unfamiliar<br />\nwith the Greek system at Hopkins<br />\nor still living with the Animal<br />\nHouse image of fraternities,<br />\nbrotherhood and sisterhood is the<br />\nfeeling that results from working<br />\nas a volunteer for the Special<br />\nOlympics or staying up all night<br />\nmaking spaghetti sauce for the<br />\nPastathon, both of which benefit<br />\ncharity.<br />\nJoseph W.

I admit this is not a complete solution, but it may help<br />\nreduce the number of freshmen in<br />\nMcCoy and Rodgers.<br />\nAnother point, somewhat<br />\nrelated to the first, concerns the<br />\ncomments made by Rachel Hendrickson in the article \"Admissions.\" While I am the first to admit that Hopkins has many strong<br />\npoints, especially in academics, I<br />\nam not convinced that students<br />\nought to \"buy into the process of<br />\nrecruiting people they think the<br />\ncampus needs.\" It would be a<br />\ngood idea, but I don't thing it<br />\nwould work very well. Reason:<br />\nall one needs to do is listen to or<br />\nread about the comments made by<br />\nstudents on the quality of social<br />\nlife. Some of the problems faced<br />\nby the students (including housing, administrative difficulties,<br />\nand the like), reveal that while<br />\nstudents can present an excellent<br />\nfactual picture of Hopkins, they<br />\nare not necessarily going to actively recruit such needed people<br />\nif they don't feel that those people would enjoy being here.<br />\nThe last comment I have is on<br />\nGretchen Van Utt. I think that the<br />\n\"President's Message\" has been<br />\nsufficiently addressed, however,<br />\nthose who think that the Chaplain<br />\nis not doing the \"proper things\"<br />\nor who feel that they need to<br />\nknow \"what she is up to\" (suggests a conspiracy, no?)ought to<br />\nreconsider. I have seen the<br />\nChaplain \"in action\" only twice,<br />\nyet on both occasions I have been<br />\nimpressed. For those who question why she does what she does,<br />\nI have a simple response: I<br />\nsuspect it's because she sees a<br />\nneed for whatever it may happen<br />\nto be, whether lesbian activities<br />\nor Oxfam. In short, while the<br />\nChaplain's Office may do things<br />\nwhich the Student Council finds<br />\nmysterious or improper, it may<br />\nwell be that the Chaplain is doing them because Student Council is not.<br /><br />\nI would like to pose a few comments in response to some of the<br />\narticles and editorials in the April<br />\n8th issue of the News-Letter.<br />\nFirst, you asked where the<br />\nnewly enlarged classes of<br />\nfreshmen could be put to foster a<br />\n\"year of true campus life with<br />\ntheir classmates.\" The University<br />\napparently has found a partial<br />\nsolution for this problem:<br />\nBuilding B.

Yet, she admitted, people still go uninformed about the<br />\ndeadline.<br />\nI would like to forward two<br />\nsuggestions to Financial Aid. The<br />\nfirst is to maintain the same<br />\ndeadline year after year. The second is to either alter the times<br />\nwhen notes are sent to Gilman or<br />\nadd another closer to the<br />\ndeadline. December represents a<br />\npoor time for three reasons: first,<br />\nCSS isn't taking applications until January; second, people are<br />\nlikely to forget that notice after<br />\nbeing on break for a month; and<br />\nthird, most parents won't have<br />\ncompleted their tax information<br />\nuntil after Christmas anyway.<br />\nThus, I would urge that notifications be sent to Gilman boxes<br />\nwhen people are more likely to<br />\nact on them. This may remove the<br />\npitfall I fell into this year.<br />\nJosh Knights<br /><br />\nChronicle criticisms<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe two-part article appearing<br />\nin the April 1st and 8th issues of<br />\nthe News-Letter on the fraternity system was an inaccurate<br />\ndepiction of the Greek system at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Although<br />\nreprinted from the \"Chronicle of<br />\nHigher Education,\" the article<br />\nmade no attempt to display the<br />\npositive aspects that life in a<br />\nfraternity offers.<br />\nAll of the fraternities and<br />\nsororities at Hopkins work<br />\ntogether on the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil (IFC) to promote unity<br />\nand to work on projects which<br />\nbenefit both the campus and the<br />\nHomewood community. Greek<br />\nmembers pooled their resources<br />\nand together with the IFC sponsored a dance marathon to raise<br />\nmoney for Students Against<br />\nMultiple Sclerosis and held an<br />\nEaster Egg Hunt on Saturday,<br />\nApril 2, 1988, for the children of<br />\nthe faculty and surrounding community. Instead of criticizing the<br />\nGreek system, the News-Letter<br />\nshould publicize events such as<br />\nthese which display the service<br />\nand brotherhood/sisterhood that<br />\nresults from Greek membership<br />\nin the community.<br />\nThe real benefit of fraternity<br />\nlife lies in the individual organization itself. Phi Gamma Delta<br />\nrecently held its annual Islander.<br />\nIt was a tremendous success, with<br />\nthe proceeds going to the Johns<br />\nHopkins Children's Center. FIJI<br />\nhas also increased faculty-student<br />\ninteraction by holding an annual<br />\nopen house in the fall.<br />\nFIJI helps out the community<br />\nby attending Chimes every Friday. The brothers serve as big<br />\nbrothers to the physically and<br />\nmentally challenged. In addition,<br />\nFill raised money for Santa Claus<br />\nAnonymous and The March of<br />\nDimes.<br />\nFinally, I hope I have proved<br />\nthat the fraternity system was unjustly criticized and should be<br />\ngiven reconsideration within the<br />\nHopkins community. The student<br />\nbody and the surrounding community stand to lose much by doing away with the fraternity<br />\nsystem.<br />\nMichael Guido<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/1 1<br /><br />\nThe new Nat. Sc.: a more stringent schedule<br />\nCURRICULUM, from 9<br />\nresearch, or internships.<br />\n(5)Proficiency in a moderr,<br />\nforeign language equivalent to<br />\none year of elements or one<br />\nsemester of intermediate level.<br />\nThe University also requires<br />\nfor graduation that you complete<br />\nat least 120 credits and maintain<br />\na 2.0 GPA.<br />\nAlready you can see that this is<br />\na potful of requirements. Let's<br />\nbreak it down in practical terms.<br />\nThe first reqirement ensures<br />\nthat science majors take at least<br />\nintroductory course work across<br />\nthe sciences. An anomaly is the<br />\nlack of a year of introductory<br />\nbiology and lab. As we know,<br />\nHopkins does not have such an<br />\noffering. Nor does Hopkins allow<br />\nnatural science majors to count<br />\nAP biology toward their requirements. Thus, the year of<br />\nbiology and lab that medical<br />\nschools demand and that the<br />\nnatural sciences majors normally take here is molecular cell<br /><br />\nbiology and lab, which are<br />\nnumbered at the 300 level.<br />\nHere's the rub: Most<br />\nundergraduate in the sciences and<br />\nall those with medical school<br />\naspirations take two semesters of<br />\nmolecular cell biology with lab,<br />\nwhich if viewed as introductroy<br />\ncourses\u2014albeit very sophisticated<br />\nintroductory courses\u2014should<br />\nthen count toward the requirement in (2). Remembering that<br />\ncourses used to meet requirements in (1)or (2)cannot be<br />\nused to fulfill the upper-level<br />\nscience course requirements, this<br />\nwould preclude MCB from being<br />\nused to meet 300 level course requirements. That, my friends\u2014<br />\ni.e. not allowing MCB to be used to meet upper-level science<br />\nrequirements\u2014is \"the heart\" of<br />\nthe new guidelines for this area<br />\nmajor.<br />\nWhy, you ask, should<br />\nmolecular cell biology, which is<br />\neffectively r. required course for<br />\neligibility to medical school, be<br />\ncounted with the introductory<br /><br />\ncourses despite (a) its 300<br />\nnumber, and (b) the fact that it is<br />\na tough course, demanding two<br />\nsemesters of introductory<br />\nchemistry plus labs and a<br />\nsemester of organic chemistry as<br />\nde facto prerequisites? I don't<br />\nknow.<br />\nAn easier question to answer is,<br />\n\"How does this compare to other<br />\nmajor in the sciences?\" Including<br />\nMCB and labs and the five<br />\n300-level science, math, or<br />\nengineering courses\u2014a total of9<br />\ncourses\u2014easily puts the natural<br />\nsciences area major on par with<br />\nupper-level science demanded of<br />\ndepartmental majors. For example, a biology major must take<br />\nMCB with labs, plus six 300-level<br />\ncourses\u2014two of which can be<br />\nMCB\u2014plus two semesters of<br />\nresearch, for a total of eight courses.<br />\nBiophysics requires six 300-level<br />\ncourses\u2014two of which can be<br />\nMCB\u2014plus two semester of<br />\nresearch, for a total of eight<br />\ncourses.<br />\nWhat truly distinguishes the<br /><br />\nnatural sciences area major from<br />\nthe others is those fifteen credits<br />\nof 300-level HIS courses.

As we<br />\nhave seen, it does not involve that<br />\nmuch more advanced science than<br />\nit used to and about the same<br />\namount as the departmental majors. For instance, if biophysics<br />\ncourse work interests you but the<br />\nadvanced physics scares you<br />\naway from the major, you could<br />\nput three biophysics courses<br />\ntogether with a couple of upperlevel psychology or biology<br />\ncourses to meet the requirement.<br />\nAnother obvious option is to<br />\nmajor in a natural sciences<br />\ndepartment. Biology, indeed, will<br />\ncertainly increase its numbers of<br />\nmajors. Over time, perhaps,<br />\nE&amp;PS or Biophysics will attract<br />\nsome disaffected natural sciences<br />\narea majors. In all likelihood<br />\nPhysics and Chemistry, owing to<br />\nthe perceived difficulty of their<br />\nrequirements, will show little<br />\ngrowth in the numbers of majors<br />\nthey have. If these changes do occur, then the desire to encourage<br />\nstudents to focus in one science<br />\ndiscipline will effectively turn out<br />\nonly to swell the ranks of the<br />\nbiology majors and prompt<br />\nundergraduates, especially<br />\npremeds, to look outside the<br />\nsciences for a major.<br />\nIndeed, choosing a non-natural<br /><br />\nsciences major is increasingly an<br />\nattractive option. Psychology,<br />\nalready a popular major, should<br />\nbecome much more so. The requirements here include four<br />\nlower-level psychology courses,<br />\nfour 300\u2014level psychology<br />\ncourses, two semesters of<br />\nstatistics, and one computer<br />\nscience course. The major has no<br />\nforeign language requirements, a<br />\ndubious advantage, but one that<br />\ncan ease your schedule.<br />\nPsychology also requires nine<br />\ncredits of natural sciences, which<br />\nfor premeds is superfluous and<br />\nfor the rest of you undergrads<br />\nshould present little problem.<br />\nAnother discipline that may<br />\nbenefit from the change in the<br />\nnatural sciences area major is far<br />\nless known than psychology. It is<br />\nHistory of Science, which this<br />\nyear will graduate its single<br />\nundergraduate major in the last<br />\nthree years! (This is a shame<br />\nbecause the department is excellent and the course work provocative.) The history of science<br />\nmajor follows the old natural<br />\nsciences area guidelines in requiring students to take forty (N)<br />\ncredits, with fifteen(N)credits at<br />\nthe 300 level. Importantly, advanced laboratories are not excluded, so both those semesters of<br />\nMCB lab would work toward the<br />\nrequirement.<br />\nThe point not to be missed is<br />\nthat after this year, the natural<br />\nsciences area major will no longer<br />\nfunction as a fallback option for<br />\nundergrads. Quite the opposite is<br />\nthe case. Now an undergrad will<br />\nhave to plan his/her course work<br /><br />\nwith relative precision two or<br />\nfour semesters in advance to insure meeting the requirements.<br />\nPlanning is the key in whatever<br />\nmajor you pursue. An effective<br />\nacademic plan allows you to<br />\nmake Hopkins work for you. Too<br />\nmany undergrads feel that this is<br />\nnot the case, that Hopkins is an<br />\nacademic war zone with<br />\ndangerous courses, sniping<br />\nT.A.'s, ruthless professors and<br />\nenough catch-22 situations for<br /><br />\nYossarian. The net result is<br />\nheightened pressure across an<br />\nalready tense campus.<br />\nBy thinking through your fall<br />\nschedule a semester or, better yet,<br />\na year in advance, you reduce the<br />\npressure. Talk to your faculty advisor. Show him/her your<br />\ntranscript along with the schedule<br />\nof courses you need and want to<br />\ntake. You can make use of your<br />\nfaculty advisor as a resource by<br />\ntentatively outlining your plans<br /><br />\nand then getting his/her input.<br />\nOtherwise, your advisor will all<br />\ntoo often be simply a signature on<br />\nyour preregistration slip.<br />\nOf course, the Office of<br />\nAcademic Advising remains at<br />\nyour service from 8:30-5:00,<br />\nfive days a week. If you want to<br />\ndiscuss the new natural sciences<br />\nrequirements or any other<br />\nacademic matters, just call<br />\n338-8216 and<br />\nmake an<br />\nappointment.<br /><br />\nLittle More Leeway<br />\nLEE. from 8<br />\njust run-of-the-mill.

Stevie could no<br />\nlonger read Playboy and Penthouse \"just for the articles.\"<br />\nIt may have taken a while to get<br />\nused to, but I realized that there's<br />\na certain beauty in a dizzying sequence of binary. Of course,<br />\nASCII isn't so bad either: \"To be<br />\nor not to be\":<br />\n(84)(111)(32)(98)(101)<br />\n(32)(111)(114)(32)(110)(111)<br />\n(84)(32)(84)(111)(32)(98)(101)<br />\n(46). Simple. Unadulterated.<br />\nLeaves no room for deconstruction or textual analysis. And<br />\nwouldn't Thomas Moore have<br />\npreferred a dizzying string of<br />\nbinary to \"The time I've lost in<br />\nwooing/ In watching and pursuing/ The light that lies/ In<br />\nwoman's eyes,/ Has been my<br />\nheart's undoing/ Tho wisdom oft<br />\nhas sought me/ I scorned the lore<br /><br />\nshe brought me,/ My only<br />\nbooks/, Were woman's looks,/<br />\nAnd folly's all they taught me\"?<br />\nAfter all, it's much easier to<br />\nrhyme numbers.<br />\nThe more I thought about it, the<br />\nmore convinced I became that<br />\nlanguages were passe, numbers<br />\nwere chic. Since I'm such a<br />\ndevoted Hoppie, it only seemed<br />\nnatural that my thinking would<br />\nturn towards Homewood. My inquiries produced a proposal<br />\nwhich I feel merits considerable<br />\nattention from the Board of<br />\nTrustees. The School of Arts &amp;<br />\nSciences (the Commas) is running at a deficit, with no chance to<br />\nturn it around for at least five<br />\nyears. The engineering school<br />\n(the Wrenches), on the other<br />\nhand, receives grants galore. We<br />\nat Hopkins pride ourselves on living at the cutting edge of<br />\neverything (except social life, of<br />\ncourse, but that's entirely another<br />\nmatter). Let's be innovators.<br />\nLet's show Bennington, Amherst,<br />\nand all those other artsy-fartsy<br /><br />\nliberal arts wimps that we're not<br />\ngoing to stand for their writing<br />\nworkshops and university press<br />\njournals. We're going to take all<br />\nour philologists, poets, and pundits and make them lab-workers.<br />\nIn order to rescue the sciences,<br />\nwe'll change the name of the<br />\nchemistry department to \"Atomic<br />\nEngineering,\" and the bio department to \"Life Engineering.\"<br />\nThen we'll hire all the liberal arts<br />\nstudents as lab rats, give the new<br />\natomic engineering department<br />\nGilman Hall to do with what they<br />\nwill, empty out MSE and make<br />\nit into a particle accelerator. Then<br />\nwe'll hoist the flag which proudly proclaims \"Hopkins Institute<br />\nof Technology.\" An added<br />\nbenefit: since the \"The\" and the<br />\n\"Johns\" have been eliminated we<br />\nwon't have to deal with those annoying misnomers.

In the darkness of the<br />\ncanvas covered truck-bed, people<br />\nwere betting on who would command the highlight of the FTX,<br />\nthe night raid. \"Two-to-one on<br />\nFenzel,\" someone said; the oddsmakers were hard at work. Karen<br />\nGrennon, a senior cadet, was sitting next to me, and explained the<br />\nlight-natured conversation was<br />\nnot uncommon. \"We spend so<br />\nmuch time together, it's inevitable that some of your best<br />\nfriends are also in ROTC.\"<br />\nOn the way I dug into my<br />\npocket and pulled out an MRE<br />\ncookie. Sweet and bland, it tasted<br />\nlike it was made of plaster of<br />\nparis and sugar.<br />\nWe finally got off the trucks<br />\nand assembled into squads and<br />\nstood around. My fingers and<br />\ntoes hurt from the cold. I had ten<br />\npockets on my uniform, none of<br />\nwhich were designed for warming my hands.<br />\nThe cadets started training at<br />\n7:30 a.m. by doing some D &amp; C<br />\n(Drill and Ceremony, i.e. marching), I took the opportunity to<br />\ntalk with Major Hawkins, who instructs the senior cadets about the<br />\ntheory behind marching around a<br />\nparking lot. \"It has a lot to do<br />\nwith the confidence that the men<br />\nhave in you,\" explained<br />\nHawkins. \"Organization is vital,<br />\nso is morale. If soldiers do things<br />\nin sync, they look good; it improves morale and pride. The<br />\nmore they practice, the better<br />\nthey'll look. . . hopefully.

The objective<br />\nwas to find your way from point<br />\nto point given only the compass<br />\nheadings and distances. I went<br />\nwith Ray, crossing creeks, down<br />\none side of ravines and up the<br />\nother. I was very hungry and<br /><br />\ndecided to eat some breakfast, a<br />\ndehydrated pork patty. \"It's better if you don't reconstitute it,\"<br />\nremarked Ray. Frankly, I don't<br />\nsee how it could have been much<br />\nworse.<br />\nWe finished the course and did<br />\nsome more D&amp;C. This time I<br />\njoined in.<br />\nAt noon we broke for chow.<br />\nWe had twenty minutes we could<br />\nalmost call our own. By that time<br />\nI was famished, although at least<br />\nthe weather had started to warm<br />\nup. I had some fortified crackers<br />\nthat looked like ceiling tiles, applesauce, and some dry fortified<br />\ncocoa mix, which, as Cadet First<br />\nSergeant Wan Kim told me,<br />\n\"tastes like malted milk balls.\"<br />\nPractkally everything was fortified, even the instant coffee. I<br />\ncouldn't imagine what it would be<br />\nlike to live on MRE's for more<br />\nthan a day..Those who had, told<br />\nme that constipation was the<br />\neventual nemesis of MRE-ridden<br />\nbattallions. What else could you<br />\nexpect from eating virtually<br />\nfiberless food that tasted better<br />\ndehydrated?<br />\n\"There's some gum in your<br />\nMRE,\" said Cadet SFC<br />\nStephanie Spengler. \"They put it<br />\nin there for a reason.\" I fished it<br />\nout and bit into it. Even the gum<br />\n4 was dehydrated. It broke into<br />\npieces before eventually becoming chewable. After chow we<br />\nmarched around the parking lot<br />\nfor another hour.<br />\nI was still trying to find out why<br />\nthese students were in ROTC. It<br />\nwas obvious that not everyone<br />\nwas gung-ho on joining the army.<br />\nDuring chow, one cadet asked if<br />\nanyone had some aspirin,jokingly adding, \"I always get a<br />\nheadache when I put on a<br />\nuniform. Must be the starch.\"<br />\nColonel Morris later filled me<br />\nin on the obvious answer. \"There<br />\nare only 12,000 Army ROTC<br />\nscholarships yearly; they're very<br />\ncompetitive. Most students in<br />\nHopkins' ROTC are on scholarship. The drop-out rate is<br />\nrelatively low. We start the year<br />\nwith around 110 cadets, and by<br /><br />\nArmy ROTC's standing eagerly anticipating their next orders.<br /><br />\nthe end we usually have 80. Some<br />\ndon't get the scholarships they<br />\nwant, mostly freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, and some leave the<br />\nuniversity.\u2014<br />\n, Soon, however, the real field<br />\ntraining started. We were issued<br />\nM-16's with blank adaptors, forty rounds of blanks, and a dummy cord, one end of which was<br />\ntied to the rifle, the other tied to<br />\nour belts. Cadet ISG Patrick<br />\nLynch explained, \"A rifle is a<br />\nsensitive item. You'll do pushups if you drop it, fire it accidently, or leave it for a moment.\" We<br />\ncamouflaged our faces and left<br />\nfor the TAX (Tactical Application<br />\neXercise) lanes.<br />\nThe first lane to which my<br />\nsquad was assigned was reaction<br />\nto contact, which included sniper<br />\nfire, artillery fire, and near and<br />\nfar ambushes. This was not a<br />\ngame. Afterwards, the seniors,<br />\nCadet Captains Jodi Nocholosi<br /><br />\nAdil Al-Shabkhoun<br /><br />\nTwo excited-looking ROTC'ers contemplate the prospect of eating nothing but MRE's. Don't they look like<br />\nthey're having fun?<br /><br />\nand Steve Angerthal, who ran the<br />\nlane, wasted no time in constructively criticizing the mistakes of<br />\nthe juniors.<br />\nNext we moved through the<br />\nmuddy woods to have Cadet Major Doug McPherson explain the<br />\npractical subtleties of staging a<br />\nhasty ambush. After that, my legs<br />\nwere scratched up from walking<br />\nthrough the brush, but it was not<br />\nuntil the last TAX lane that I<br />\nrealized how bad the brush could<br />\nget.<br />\nCadet Captain Todd Baker explained our objective for the last<br />\nlane: reconnaissance of some<br />\nelectrical towers. Throughout the<br />\nattack lanes, seniors and<br />\nfreshmen had the role of being<br />\nOPFOR (OPposition FORces). In<br />\nthis lane we were supposed to<br />\nclandestinely determine if the<br />\ntowers were guarded, and if so,<br />\nby how many OPFORs. Tom<br />\nHenkel was put in command of<br />\nthis operation. I was chosen to accompany Henkel on the mission.<br />\nThings were going fine until he<br />\nand I were at the edge of the<br />\nwoods, taking note of the situation. There were two OPFORs<br />\nposting guard at the tower.<br />\nCrouching low in the underbrush, Henkel had a thorn pierce<br />\nhis earlobe. When I tried to<br />\nunhook him, we were spotted and<br />\nfired on. We quickly pulled out<br />\nand made our way back to the<br />\nbase that had been set up. It was<br />\nonly later that I realized I had<br />\nscratched my legs on some barbed wire on our escape route.<br />\nThe exercise was now completed. We marched back to the<br />\nparking lot. I realized that<br />\neveryone had been scratched by<br />\nthe brush. \"We have some minor<br />\ninjuries, some cuts by the brush<br />\nmost typically, but nothing<br />\nserious. The Army is very safety<br />\nconscious,\" explained Morris.<br />\nWhen we got back, we were informed that the night raid had<br />\nbeen cancelled because of lack of<br />\nspace. Kwan later explained,<br />\n\"The guy who ran Gunpowder<br />\nretired, and his replacement did<br />\nnot notice we were scheduled to<br /><br />\nuse the reserve. Basically, our<br />\npaperwork got lost in the shuffle.\" It was decided that we<br />\nshould get back into the trucks<br />\nand finish the exercise at<br />\nHopkins. Instead of doing a night<br />\nraid, the cadets would have to<br />\nplan it out fully.<br />\nEverybody was exhausted as<br />\nwe lumbered towards the trucks<br />\nuntil senior cadet major Ed Marsh<br />\ntold us we had thirty seconds to<br />\nget stowed away. Somehow, we<br />\ndid it.<br />\nThe ride back to Hopkins was<br />\nquieter than the ride out. We got<br />\nback at quarter to seven.<br />\n\"You've got two minutes to get<br />\ninto the building,\" yelled Marsh<br />\nEverybody started moving.<br />\nMarsh briefed the cadets on the<br />\npatrol order and assigned the<br />\ncommands to the cadets.<br />\nFor the next six hours the<br />\ncadets worked on the platoon<br />\norder, and upon completing it,<br />\nthey turned to the tedious task of<br />\ncleaning the rifles. At 3:15 a.m.<br />\nthe FTX was over and the cadets<br />\nwent home.<br />\nThe cadets had done a lot that<br />\nday, but it was not just an exercise in endurance. \"Hopkins<br />\ncomes in the top ten of all the<br />\nschools that go to Advanced<br />\nCamp,\" explained Morris, \"due<br />\nmainly to the combination of the<br />\ncaliber of students, the etxtent of<br />\nthe training, and the enthusiasm.<br />\nThe seniors set up and carried out<br />\nthis exercise, so the leadership is<br />\npassed along.<br />\n\"The idea is not to make infantry commanders out of these<br />\ncadets but to use tactics as a tool<br />\nto develop officers. We put them<br />\nin stressful situations and see how<br />\nthey lead, how people react to<br />\nthem. Are they forceful and aggressive? And if things go wrong,<br />\ndo they fall apart or adjust?\"<br />\nMorris added.<br />\nDespite occasional jokes, it was<br />\nobvious that everybody took the<br />\nexercise seriously.

In the case of these<br />\nsubtler tunes, however, they provide a stark contrast to the frenzy that surrounds them, and since<br />\nthey all deal with rather heavy<br />\nsubjects like death and love, they<br />\nmight be seen as the moments of<br />\nintrospection in an otherwise<br />\ncrazed environment. In all, Rubin<br />\nhas done an excellent job of compiling music that works in terms<br />\nof the film, while still providing<br />\nsomething for all the music enthusiasts who'll buy the<br />\nsoundtrack.<br />\nProbably no one, however, has<br />\nas much experience in combining<br />\nhip music with film as John<br />\nHughes, the king of the<br />\n\"youthploitation\" film. All of<br />\nHughes' films have featured<br />\nsoundtracks that sold as well as<br />\nthe film, at least in part because<br />\nhe knows enough about music to<br />\npick up on what's popular\u2014and,<br /><br />\nalso weakens the film since it<br />\nseems difficult to resolve the<br />\nserious tone of the film with the<br />\narrested adolescence of the<br />\nsoundtrack. If Hughes was interested in attracting an older audience with his material, perhaps<br />\nhe should have re-thought his<br />\nsoundtrack, and aimed at a slightly older, more sophisticated audience. Don't get me wrong\u2014it's<br />\na fine compilation that holds<br />\ntogether well, and it features<br />\nenough new stuff to make it worth<br />\nbuying, but it just seems out of<br />\nplace with the content of the film.<br />\nI don't know, maybe I should try<br />\ngetting married and having a kid,<br />\nand then see what music I like\u2014<br />\nmaybe I would start feeling<br />\nnostalgic for some Love and<br />\nRocket, who knows?<br /><br />\nin cases of films like Pretty in<br />\nPink, it was the music that sold<br />\nthe film. Hughes might have<br />\nstruck out, however, with his new<br />\nfilm, She's Having a Baby. The<br />\nproblem's not with the music.<br />\nHell, with originals by folks like<br />\nDave Wakeling (General Public,<br />\nthe English Beat) and unreleased<br />\ntracks by groups like Love and<br />\nRockets and XTC, followed up<br />\nwith such reliable stand-bys as<br />\nBryan Ferry and Kate Bush, this<br />\nsoundtrack boasts enough<br />\nmaterial to send any sixteen-yearold into a \"hipness overdose.\"<br />\nThe problem is, do the people<br />\nwho listen to this music want to<br />\nsee a film about yuppies getting<br />\nmarried and having a kid? It<br />\nseems that Hughes might be<br />\nshooting for one audience with<br />\nhis screenplay and another entire<br />\naudience with the soundtrack.<br />\nSuch a strategy would draw in<br />\ntwo unrelated audiences, but it<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nAmy Reiter on<br />\nthe Musical Showcase<br />\nMUSIC<br /><br />\nby Amy Reiter<br />\nVoices, guitars, pianos, synthesizers, accordions, bagpipes.<br />\nThere were a helluvalot of kinds<br />\nof music heard in Shriver last<br />\nThursday night.<br />\nAnd there are a helluvalot of<br />\nmusically talented people here at<br />\nHopkins.

The audience<br />\nwas thus ensured of at least a nonpainful evening. No warblers or<br />\nplunkers allowed. The show<br />\ncame off as pretty professional.<br />\nAnd the musicians had a chance<br />\nto get out of their solitary practice rooms and their garages at<br />\nleast once before the performance.

Each act<br />\nran about six minutes, one or<br />\ntwo songs. This gave the performer a chance to show his stuff<br />\nwithout requiring an extensive<br />\nrepertoire. It was a \"best of..<br />\nshow. You just know how much<br />\npractice has gone into each<br />\nperformance.<br />\nThe performers were judged in<br />\nfive categories: Classical, Pop,<br />\nRock, Miscellaneous, and Best<br />\nOverall Performer.

I had to send<br />\na note to make sure that the<br />\ntrue love of friendship has not<br />\n\u2022 faded,since I do not hear from<br />\nmany of us anymore, and there<br />\nare few left. I recollect those<br />\ndays at the academy with<br />\nrenewed vigor even as I write.<br />\nI remember Beezub and you<br />\nand myself on that mountain<br />\nnot too many summers ago.<br />\nBeezub had those old flat soled cowboy boots, and all it<br />\ntook was one good push from<br />\nthe two of us to send him<br />\nskating down the mountainside, his joyous screams mixed<br />\nwith ones of terror as his cloud<br />\nof dust faded into the dusk.<br />\nI draw on these visions out<br />\nof a mind clouded with<br />\nalcoholic fondness of a youth<br />\nthat will live forever in the articles about the academy<br />\nwhich I have been asked to<br />\nwrite, by the new administration. How do you like that? No<br />\nlonger shall the young men be<br />\ntrained by the headmaster and<br />\ndeans<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\nthe<br />\nschoolmasters, but by principals and teachers and<br />\ncounselors. The education of<br />\nthe masses has been inflicted<br />\nupon our alma mater like some<br />\nkind of cancer, which will<br /><br />\nsiege of the capital had come<br />\nto a bloody finale after a thirtyday standstill. He seemed<br />\ndistraught over what he had<br />\nseen and wrote only of the last<br />\ndays we had spent together.<br />\nI sensed a drunken quality to<br />\nhis ramblings and could not<br />\npin down exactly which wrong<br />\ndetour his mind had taken to<br />\nbecome so lost in a sandstorm<br />\nof memories. He also recounted the ride down the<br />\nmountain that day, but his narrative did not carry the usual<br />\nfondness that often punctuated<br />\nmany of Beezub's recollection.<br />\nIt was as if the kind and gentle nature had been excised by<br />\na violent and swift blade, leaving a vacant abyss, flooded<br />\nwith an uncharacteristic<br />\ncheerless disposition.<br />\nI am asking you to tell me<br />\nwhat you think of all of this,<br />\nsince you chose to lead a more<br />\nstable life, going into your<br />\nfather's business like we<br />\nalways knew you would. Can<br />\nwe be blamed for carrying out<br />\nour youthful dreams of<br />\nadventure?<br />\nSensing the distraught<br />\nnature of Beezub, I asked him<br />\nto come and visit my cabin until the cold snap of late fall<br />\nwould drive us either back to<br />\ncivilization or to another<br />\nassignment or adventure. He<br />\nsent a reply sooner than I<br />\nwould have thought possible,<br /><br />\ns ow y sprea into the ranks o and it was strangely signed,<br />\nthe alumni until our memories \"Beezub the Wanderer.\"<br />\nof the green lawns and- I arrived at the cabin several<br />\nmonumental buildings shall days in<br />\nadvance and<br />\ndwindle into nothingness.<br />\nstraightened things up, stockI have been having trouble, ing the pantry with some<br />\nthough.

The sedi- remember Beezub had acment of a life crashing bet- quired a taste for in New<br />\nween the major cities of the Guinea, and with a case of<br />\nworld, covering battles and bourbon, which I have become<br />\nadventures from here to the accustomed to. The fall was<br />\nverge of insanity has left the just settling in, so the day was<br />\ndays I now seek obscured by cool and mosquito free as<br />\nother layers. I can truly see Beezub arrived, the sun in the<br />\nwhat those days were, but I tops of the yellow and red<br />\nbuild castles out of the mud, trees. He walked from the old<br />\nand I don't want my work to Ranger jeep with the swagger<br />\nbe seen as a foil's reminiscient of a young man,and tossed his<br />\nvision of a lost time. I would bag up on the porch.

Hell, of course we can go<br />\nand give it a try.\"<br />\nBoth of us broke out<br />\nlaughing at the idea of going<br />\nafter the trout which we had<br />\nnamed after the headmaster in<br />\nour youth at the academy. I<br />\ndidn't know if he was still<br />\nalive, but it would be good to<br />\ngo and find out. If he was<br />\nthere, Beezub and I were<br />\ndetermined, as always, to catch<br />\nhim.<br />\nBeezub told me about a recent fishing trip as he fixed us<br />\na couple drinks. \"The stream<br />\nwe had been following was full<br />\nof salmon. A few of us had<br />\nbeen smart enough to bring<br />\nour fly rods, and the action<br /><br />\nwas incredib e. At one point<br />\nwas wading in mid-stream up<br />\nto my nuts in freezing water<br />\nwhen a huge Koho took off<br />\nwith my fly. I got dragged in up<br />\nto my armpits before I landed<br />\nhim. I carried him back above<br />\nmy head, my knife stuck in his<br />\nskull. That was the best dinner<br />\nI had the whole summer.\"<br />\nWe sat on the porch in high<br />\nback chairs while the meat<br />\nsizzled on the grill. Beezub still<br />\nhad the lean build of his<br />\nyounger day, and wore a white<br />\nshirt tucked crisply into tan<br />\nshorts. His hair was combed<br />\nback and blond from the odd<br />\nmonths of the desert sun,<br />\nwhich had also left him with a<br />\nleathery complexion, from<br />\nbehind which his eyes twinkled in the fall air.<br />\nI still sensed a great wall in<br />\nhim, behind which stormed<br />\nthe minions of whatever<br />\ntempest assailed him. The only relief afforded him was to<br />\ntalk about some of his earlier<br />\nadventures. He spoke fondly<br /><br />\nnot only of his fishing expeditear he spent<br />\nin Australia.<br />\n\"I'm telling you, the country<br />\nis a virgin land. The raw power<br />\nthat shapes continents still exists there, I have felt it. I did<br />\nsome of my best work up in<br />\nQueensland. I would lug the<br />\nold Underwood up there and<br />\nand spend days hammering<br />\naway at the keys, aware of<br />\nsome kind of direction shaping<br />\nmy thoughts. It was as if the<br />\nland had bridged the gap between my ideas and that battered old typewriter. It's closing on the frontier now,<br />\nthough. The aborigines are being squeezed out of existence.<br />\nThey don't have any means to<br />\nfight for their land, and as a<br />\nresult they are suffering horribly. Of course in Afghanistan<br />\nthe rebels have the means, but<br />\neven their bloody children are<br />\nbeing. . \" He stopped and<br />\nlooked at his hands, which had<br />\nbeen punctuating his remarks.<br />\n\"Beezub, I think our steaks<br />\nare ready,\" I said, just to stop<br />\nthe look that had fallen on his<br />\nface. I stared in grim fascination. His face was like a neon<br />\nsign flickering in a shop window. Something evil had<br />\nfound him and made its<br />\nremark. I was if the door to<br />\nhell had opened up, and the<br />\nDevil had stared him right in<br />\nthe eye. I had never seen him<br />\ntions, but of the<br /><br />\nlike this. He loo e up with a<br />\nsmile that could freeze water<br />\nand said, \"Let's eat then.\"<br />\nWe had shared too much for<br />\nme to turn my back, but I was<br />\nnot sure I would be able to<br />\nweather the storm which now<br />\nthreatened.<br />\nWe ate in silence. Beezub<br />\nwould sit back and stare into<br />\nthe forest as he chewed each<br />\nmouthfull, then he would<br />\nglance over at me. I kept my<br />\neyes focused on my plate, worried that whatever I might say<br />\nwould provoke unwanted<br />\nmemories. All he said was,<br />\n\"This is good.\"<br />\nAfter dinner, I gathered my<br />\nfishing equipment and picked<br />\nout a light, handbuilt rod. I<br />\nhad whiled away a few hours<br />\ntying some of my own flies<br />\nwhil waiting for Beezub, and<br />\nthere was a new one I was<br />\nespecially eager to try. I walked out onto the porch, where<br />\nBeezub had been readying<br />\nhimself from a bag that he had<br />\nContinued on 23<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/23<br /><br />\nPseudoPerspicacity<br />\nMuch has been made of the<br />\nprogress achieved by American<br />\nblacks in the decades since the<br />\ncivil rights movement came onto<br />\nthe domestic political scene.

Much<br />\nof Paton's desire for change in<br />\nSouth Africa arose from this experience, which instilled a deep<br />\ncynicism in regards to the dark<br />\nside of all human nature.<br />\nWhile at Diepkloof, Paton<br />\nwrote his most famous work, Cry<br />\nthe Beloved Country which was<br /><br />\nI watched as Beezub glanced into the depths were old<br />\nLawson supposedly made his<br />\nhome.I always marveled at the<br />\nway the huge tree had fallen so<br />\nmany years ago to form the<br />\nsluice which had cut the<br />\noverhang into the rock. I imagined the old trout might still<br />\nbe under there, giving us the<br />\ncalculating glances that we<br />\nwere giving him. Beezub truly<br />\nbelieved that the old fish might<br />\nlive that long, and he made the<br />\nfirst few casts into the middle<br />\nof the stream just to test the<br /><br />\nJonathan Engler<br />\ntranslated into twenty languages,<br />\nmade into a film soon thereafter,<br />\nand even became a tragic<br />\nmusical. A book called Too Late<br />\nfor Phalarope and a series of<br />\nshort stories followed.<br />\nPaton was also president of the<br />\nLiberal Party of South Africa until its ban in 1968, and his opposition to the policy of apartheid led<br />\nto the seizure of his passport by<br />\nthe South African government in<br />\n1960 upon his return from a visit<br />\nto the United States where he had<br />\nreceived a Freedom House<br />\naward.<br />\nHis sparse and tightly controlled style was also expressed in the<br />\ncolumn he wrote for the political<br />\njournal Contact, as well as<br />\nnumerous political commentaries<br />\nranging from history to<br />\nsociology.<br />\nIn the end, however, it is for<br />\nhis novels that he is best<br /><br />\nwaters. I sat and watched for<br />\na few minutes, pretending to<br />\nunsnare my line, captivated by<br />\nthe intentness of Beezub on<br />\nthe eddys and currents around<br />\nthe lengthening shadow of the<br />\noverhand. He pulled in a few<br />\nsmall rainbows, but slid them<br />\noff the hook, which had a<br />\ncrimped barb, letting them<br />\ngently go. It was always his<br />\nstyle, believing even in the<br />\nsanctity of the small fish.<br />\nI joined him,casting wide into the shadows, a small current<br />\npulling my fly straight into the<br /><br />\nremembered, particularly the<br />\nmasterpiece Cry the Beloved<br />\nCountry. Those who consider<br />\nthemselves to be on the leading<br />\nedge of progressive politics in<br />\ntheir opposition to South African<br />\npolitical tactics should bear in<br />\nmind that this work was written<br />\nin 1948. Paton spent a courageous<br />\nlife in direct opposition to a very<br />\npowerful regime in which the<br />\ncracks have only recently begun<br />\nto appear. His life stands in contrast to the politics of instant<br />\ngratification which we have<br />\nbecome used to in the United<br />\nStates, and as such there are<br />\nlessons to be learned as we<br />\nbecome nonchalant about continuing racism in the United States.<br />\nChange comes slow in its lasting<br />\nform, and no-one knew this better or worked harder in spite of<br />\nit than Alan Stewart Paton.<br /><br />\nheart of the cleft. Just as the<br />\nbait floated clear into the<br />\nsunlight, a large swirl appeared<br />\nand a dark shadown passed<br />\nunder the bait. Beezub watched my cast in anticipation, and<br />\nlet his fly drift to the opposite<br />\nbank, where it became entangled in some branches. I<br />\ntook the opportunity to show<br />\nhim my new fly, and he held<br />\nit up to the last rays of sunlight<br />\nto admire its craftsmanship.<br />\n\"It's a killer.\"<br />\nHe tied it onto his leader<br />\nContinued on 24<br /><br />\nWhen you've ota beer<br />\nthis rich andThvorftjl,<br />\nwhysuck alime?<br /><br />\nLet's face it,amigos,any beer that needs a slice oflime to give it flavor can't be much ofa beer.<br />\nDiscover Calgary Amber Lager..

A<br />\nwake left by the tail of the fish<br />\nwas the only thing which<br />\nmarked the spot.

Easing and spooling, he slowly<br />\npulled the fish out of the<br />\nnotch. It remained deep, not<br />\nrevealing its size.

For eighteen<br />\ncenturies the country was<br />\nneglected by its rulers, and higher<br />\neducation was nonexistent. The<br />\nreturn of Jews, which began 100<br />\nyears ago, marked a new era. The<br />\nHebrew University in Jerusalem<br />\nwas founded in 1918, followed by<br />\nthe Technion in Haifa a few years<br />\nlater.<br />\nIn 1948 the State of Israel was<br />\nborn. While struggling with<br />\nsevere security and economic<br />\nproblems, Israel absorbed<br />\nmillions of Jewish refugees from<br />\nEurope and the Middle East and<br />\nat the same time developed an excellent education system. Israelis<br />\ntoday (4 million in number) enjoy six major universities and<br />\nother excellent research institutions. In only 40 years Israel has<br />\nbecome a leader in many scientific and industrial specialties,<br />\nagriculture, medicine, solar<br />\nenergy and others. Today the<br />\ncountry leads the world in the<br />\nnumber of scientific papers<br />\npublished per capita. Graduates<br />\nof Israeli universities are<br />\nemployed by the world's best<br />\nresearch<br />\nand<br />\nacademic<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nSpeakers from seven of these<br />\nuniversities and institutions<br />\ngathered on April 6th to celebrate<br />\nIsrael's 40 years of scientific<br />\nachievement. Their areas of<br />\nfrom<br />\nspecialty<br />\nranged<br />\n\"Agriculture in the Negev\" and<br />\n\"Life in the Dead Sea\" to<br />\n\"NMR in Biology and<br />\nMedicine\" and \"Inertial Navigation of Aerospace Systems.\"<br />\nMedicine and Biotechnology<br />\nOn the topic of biotechnology,<br />\ntwo speakers discussed various<br />\naspects of Israel's contribution to<br />\nthe field. Professor Gil Navon of<br />\nTel Aviv University, a visiting<br />\nscientist at the National Institute<br />\nof Health (NIH) spoke on the<br />\nbiomedical applications of<br />\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance<br />\n(NMR). At first, Navon reviewed the basis of NMR. He explained that NMR initially only<br />\ndetected interactions between<br />\nhydrogen atoms. Recently,<br />\nhowever, in Israel, techniques<br />\nhave been developed to detect<br />\nbiologically important atoms such<br />\nas phosphorus.<br />\nNavon emphasized the practical uses of NMR. He discussed<br />\nhow data obtained from NMR<br />\ncan be processed to give a clear<br />\npicture of the brain. This tecnhique, which in the U.S. is known<br />\nas Magnetic Resonance Imaging<br />\n(MRI), results in the best resolution, even better than the conventional CAT scan. MRI is widely<br />\nused today to detect brain abnormalities and tumors.<br />\nAnother speaker, Dr. Stephan<br />\nRokem, described \"Israel's<br />\nresearch and development of old<br />\nand new compounds for<br />\nmedicine, food, and agriculture.\"<br /><br />\nRokem, a microbiologist at<br />\nHebrew University, is currently<br />\na visiting professor at Yale. He<br />\nbegan by defining biotechnology<br />\nand discussing its origins.<br />\nRokem says, biotechnology is<br />\n\"the use of cells or parts thereof<br />\nfor the production of useful<br />\nmaterials.\" Biotech is nothing<br />\nnew, according to Rokem, as the<br />\nEgyptians used microorganisms<br />\nsuch as yeast to ferment wine and<br />\nbread as early as 4000 years ago.<br />\nThis is known as \"classical<br />\nbiotechnology.\" More recently,<br />\n\"modern<br />\nsays,<br />\nRokem<br />\nbiotechnology\" began in 1916. In<br />\n1916, Chaim Weizmann, later to<br />\nbecome President of Israel, was<br />\nliving in England. He patented a<br />\nmethod for the fermentation of<br />\nacetone butanot. This development was important because<br />\nacetone was useful in the British<br />\nwar effort. Rokem credited Weizmann's discovery as an inspiration behind the Balfour Declaration, which in 1917 affirmed the<br />\nright of the Jewish people to a national homeland in Palestine.<br />\n\"New biotechnology\" was<br />\nushered in 1975, claims Rokem,<br />\nwith the development of the<br />\nfollowing techniques: \"Recombinant DNA (genetic engineering),<br />\nmonoclonal antibodies, enzyme<br />\nand protein engineering, and<br />\nbiosensers.\" Biosensers are enzymes used to measure components such as sugars inside the<br />\nbody, with the removal of<br />\nmaterial from the body.<br />\nThe industries that benefit from<br />\nthe new biotechnology are varied.<br />\nThe chemical industry has<br />\ndiscovered new sources of<br />\nenergy. Biodegradable fibers<br />\nhave been developed. These<br />\nfibers permit surgical sutures to<br />\ndissolve soon after surgery.<br />\nRokem also discussed the<br />\npossibilties of biodegradable containers, and perhaps one day,<br />\ndrinking beer out of edible cans.<br />\nThe medical and health industries have successfully<br />\ndeveloped antiobiotics, and interferon (an agent that fights viral<br />\ninfections) in large quantities. In<br />\naddition, blood products, hormones, vaccines, artificial skin,<br />\nand immune regulators :save been<br />\nformed. In the field of<br />\nagriculture, improved techniques<br />\nin plant breeding, growth of plants<br />\nand animals, and pest control<br />\nhave all come about as a result of<br />\nbiotechnology. Certain plants<br />\nproduce compounds important to<br />\nmedicine. An example is vinblastine, which is used to treat<br />\nleukemia. Due to the small quantities of these drugs available,<br />\nthey are expensive. By improving<br />\nplant growth, says Rokem, the<br />\namount of these drugs will increase, resulting in more drugs<br />\navailable at lower prices.<br />\nTo complete his lecture,<br />\nRokem discussed some of the<br />\nresearch that Israeli scientists<br />\nhave pioneered. Researchers at<br />\nthe Weizmann Institute have<br />\ndiscovered the mechanism of interferon's action. Other scientists<br />\nat the Hebrew University have<br />\nbeen successful in incorporating<br />\nforeign DNA into cells that have<br /><br />\npreviously resisted such attempts.<br />\nCurrent research includes an egg<br />\nyolk extract, now being tested in<br />\nthe US, that has proven effective<br />\nagainst the AIDS virus.<br />\nArchaeology<br />\nArchaeology in Israel is \"an indication of what we can learn<br />\nfrom the past for the future,\"<br />\nasserts Dr. Avner Raban. Raban<br />\nis the chairman of the Center for<br />\nMarine Studies at Haifa University and a visiting professor at<br />\nHarvard. He discussed the<br />\nmysteries of the coastal Mediterranean in a lecture entitled \"Ancient Harbors for Modern<br />\nArTechnology\u2014Marine<br />\nchaeology in Israel.\" Raban explained how modern technology<br />\nhas aided scientists in their<br />\ndiscoveries of ancient villages<br />\nunder the Mediterranean.<br />\nThe erosion of coastline over<br />\nthousands of years had created<br />\ndangerous conditions for coastal<br />\ncities. Israeli engineers solved<br />\nthis problem by bringing ashore<br />\nsand from the depths. The<br />\ntransfer of sand uncovered the ancient villages. Raban claims that<br />\nthe sand preserved the artifacts<br />\nextremely well by absorbing the<br />\nstresses and impact of the sea and<br />\nnormal<br />\nby<br />\npreventing<br />\ndeterioration.<br />\n4<br />\nAmong the<br />\ninteresting<br />\ndiscoveries that Raban and his<br />\ncolleagues have unearthed are the<br />\nremains of an 8000-year-old<br />\nskeleton, the \"earliest diver,\" as<br />\nRaban calls it. The structure of<br />\nthe ear bones indicate a pressure<br />\ndifference between the inside and<br />\noutside, characteristic of divers.<br />\nOf the 16 skeletons found, six<br />\nshare this structure.<br />\nRaban's group has also<br />\ndiscovered the walls of villages<br />\nnow submerged after thousands<br />\nof years. The walls represent the<br />\nengineering sophistication of the<br />\nancient builders. Their existence<br />\ntoday is a testimony to the integrity of the ancient structures, Raban<br />\nsays. He adds that the walls are<br />\nmade up of \"well-cut stones,\"<br />\nand that only 5 percent of the surface faced the sea, while the rest<br />\nwas found inside the block. When<br />\nthe waves would crash against the<br />\nwall, they would be sucked back<br />\nout, minimizing the impact of the<br />\nwave. Raban emphasized this<br />\nengineering feat by stating that<br />\nsimilar walls built 20-25 years<br />\nago are deteriorating already.<br />\nAlso fascinating was Raban's<br />\ndescription of the construction of<br />\nancient undersea breakwaters at<br />\nCaesaria. Scientists have<br />\nevidence that the blocks were<br />\nconstructed while they were<br />\nalready underwater. Thorough<br />\nanalysis of the block's composition lead to the following<br />\nhypothesis, as elucidated by<br />\nRaban. The wooden scaffolding<br />\nfor the wall was built onshore.<br />\nThen, cement, composed of 40<br />\npercent ash from Mount Vesuvius,<br />\nwas poured into holes.

According to Dr. Neil MacDonald,<br />\na certified physical therapist and<br />\noperational manager of sports<br />\nmedicine at Union Memorial<br />\nHospital, there is no true<br />\nsubspecialty in medical school for<br />\nthis field. Individuals often<br />\nreceive training after medical<br />\nschool from specialty programs<br />\nsponsored through fellowships;<br />\nthese programs last some six<br />\nmonths to one year. At Union<br />\nMemorial, the trainee spends his<br />\ntime predominantly with a sports<br />\nmedicine physician, learning to<br />\ntreat the injuries suffered by<br />\nathletes.<br />\nAlthough this field may have<br />\njust recently emerged, a common<br />\nbackground is often shared by individuals interested in sports<br />\nmedicine. Many have experience<br />\nin orthopedics and find the transition to this health profession<br />\nrather natural. Recently,<br />\nhowever, sports medicine has<br />\ngrown and established itself in<br />\nmany health-related fields, rang<br />\ning from family practice to cardiology. In Dr. MacDonald's<br />\nwords, \"so much is preventative. . .it is necessary to work<br />\nwith family and children with<br /><br />\nsports related injury.\" Therefore,<br />\nthe spread of sports medicine into family practice was inevitable.<br />\nThe impression that one may<br />\nhave when talking about sports<br />\nmedicine is the repair of torn<br />\nligaments, stretched tendons or<br />\nankle injuries. Although this field<br />\nmay be new and case studies concerning the surgical procedures<br />\nhave not yet reached the journals<br />\nof medicine, sports medicine has<br />\nutilized current techniques, in<br />\nparticular arthroscopic surgery.<br />\nA small opening is introduced<br />\nin the damaged region, be it a<br />\nknee, hip, or ankle, and the<br />\nnecessary repairs are made with<br />\n\"minimal invasiveness of procedure.\" Such surgical techniques comprise only one out of<br />\nevery fifteen individuals with a<br />\nsports-related injury. Much of<br />\nsports medicine is preventative as<br />\nwell. Union Memorial Hospital<br />\nplaces individuals on exercise<br />\nprograms to prevent unnecessary<br />\ninjuries from occurring. Health<br />\nproblems related to athletics often<br />\ncan be categorized in one group,<br />\n\"overuse.\" The muscle pain or<br />\nswollen ankle occurs in people<br />\n\"doing too much, too often, too<br />\nfast.\" Dr. MacDonald gives the<br />\nexample of females who wish to<br />\nlose weight for the coming spring<br />\nand decide to run a mile or two.<br />\nAfter two or three nights, they<br />\nmay feel pain from overuse; the<br /><br />\nbody has just not been able to<br />\nadapt so quickly.

He had just put together<br />\nan impressive 1987 campaign,<br />\nfinishing 10-5 and ranked seventh<br />\nin the nation. Though he lost<br />\nsome key players, including<br />\nAll-American<br />\nsecond-team<br />\ndefenseman Tom Hickman, he<br />\nreturned his top scorer in Bob<br />\nBetchley and one of the nation's<br />\ntop goalies in Tom Portuese. His<br />\nCadets were ranked number<br />\ntwelve in the preseason polls, and<br />\nopened with two victories. But<br />\nthen everything seemed to come<br />\napart.<br />\nThe collapse began on March<br />\n13, when the Cadets faced the<br />\nhighly-touted Big Red at Cornell.<br />\nDown 9-6 at the three minute<br />\nmark, Army rallied to put a scare<br />\ninto last year's NCAA runnerup. Tom Desperito scored his second goal of the game with 2:34<br />\nto play, and when Betchley tallied<br />\nonly 26 seconds later, it appeared<br />\nthat the Cadest might pull off the<br />\nupset. Though Cornell held off<br />\nthe rally for a 9-8 win, Coach<br />\nErnmer had to be pleased with his<br />\nteam's performance, especially<br />\nPortuese, who sparkled with<br />\ntwenty saves.<br /><br />\nThe following week, however,<br />\nnot even Portuese was on. Army<br />\nwas completely dominated 15-4<br />\nby Brown in a game that should<br />\nhave been much closer. The only bright spot for the Cadets was<br />\nBob Betchley, who continued his<br />\nquest to duplicate his 42 goal and<br />\n21 assist performance of last<br />\nseason with three more goals. He<br />\ngot four more in the Carrier<br />\nDome on March 26, but the<br />\nOrangemen shelled Army 19-8.<br />\nAfter losing three straight<br />\ngames, the schedule provided the<br />\nCadets with a little relief. Army<br />\ncoasted to a victory over<br />\nMichigan State, but then struggled to a mere 5-4 win over a<br />\nhapless Bucknell team. Coach<br />\nEmmer's pre-season optimism<br />\nsurely was rattled, and this was<br />\nthe last thing his team needed as<br />\nthey prepared to face their archrival Navy last week.<br />\nThe Cadets came out fired up<br />\nlast Saturday, as the defense finally lived up to their pre-season<br />\nbilling. Brilliant goal-tending by<br />\nTom Portuese had Army leading<br />\n5-3 entering the fourth quarter.<br />\nNavy, however, refused to be<br />\nupset and quickly tied the score<br />\nat five. When Navy tallied again<br />\nwith 1:32 to play to seal a 6-5 victory, Army was left with a 4-4<br /><br />\nrecord heading into the toughest<br />\npart of their schedule.<br />\nArmy will now face three topten teams in seven days, beginning this Saturdsay night in West<br />\nPoint with a 7:00 game against<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Blue Jays. The<br />\nfollowing Wednesday, Army<br />\nfaces the surprising Yale Eli<br />\nbefore next Saturday's showdown<br />\nwith Massachusetts. To turn<br />\nthings around, the Cadets are going to need some outstanding play<br />\nfrom Portuese. Tom had a save<br />\npercentage of 65.3 last season,<br />\nbut he struggled all the way<br />\nwithout Hickman playing in front<br />\nof him. Betchley. Hoynes, and<br />\nDesperito are all capable of scoring a lot of goals, but they need<br />\nsome help from the rest of their<br />\nteammates if they are going to<br />\nstay with teams such as Hopkins.<br />\nRight now, Army is in serious<br />\ndanger of not making the NCAA<br />\nTournament. The Cadets have not<br />\nwon a big game all season, and<br />\ntheir solid performance against<br />\nCornell is no longer as impressive<br />\nwhen you consider that the Big<br />\nRed has dropped to 2-4. Unless<br />\nCoach Emmer's team can turn<br />\nthings around this week, their<br />\nMay 7 game against Rutgers will<br />\nbe their final one of the season.<br /><br />\nSyracuse (10)<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nVirginia<br />\nLoyola (Md.)<br />\nYale<br />\nMaryland<br />\nPennsylvania<br />\nMassachusetts<br />\nBrown<br />\nHarvard<br />\nC.W.

An amazed<br />\nCoach Gary Green said afterwards, \"This is really, really<br />\nunusual, even unbelievable. The<br />\nrecord was really shattered. Sixth<br />\ntenths of a second is a big deal in<br />\na 100 meter dash. What's so funny is that they were in the same<br />\nheat out of four heats for the<br />\ntrials, and they ran the same incredible record-breaking time,<br />\none in lane 1 and one in lane 8.<br />\nI expect this record to last only<br />\na week or so before one or both<br />\nof them rebreaks it.\" He turned<br />\nout to be wrong; it was only four<br />\ndays. Last Wednesday in a trimeet against Division I Baltimore<br /><br />\nrivals UMBC and Towson State,<br />\nboth Gifford and Johnson again<br />\nran under their new record, with<br />\nGifford just barely edging<br />\nJohnson out with a time of 12.6.<br />\nThe 200 meter dash record also<br />\nfell on Wednesday when Gifford<br />\nand Johnson, in separate heats,<br />\nboth ran 27.4, just under the old<br />\nrecord of 27.5.

Johnson was<br />\nthe high scorer for Hopkins, earning 8 points by placing third in<br /><br />\nthe triple jump, sixth in the long<br />\njump, and sixth in the 100 meter<br />\ndash; she is now qualified for the<br />\nMAC meet in all three events.<br />\nJohnson also anchored the bronze<br />\nmedal 4 X 100 meter relay team<br />\nof Gifford, Logan, and Perlinn.<br />\nOther point-earners, all of whom<br />\nalso qualified, were McGinn\u2014<br />\nthird place and a bronze medal in<br />\nthe 800, Gifford\u2014fourth place in<br />\nthe 100, Perlinn\u2014fourth place in<br />\nthe 400 meter hurdles, Logan\u2014<br />\nfifth in the 400, Molly Bardsley\u2014<br />\nfifth in the 3000, and Tamsen<br />\nLove\u2014sixth in 5000.

The Lady Jays<br /><br />\nnetted only ten points in the field<br />\nevents, while UMBC and<br />\nTowson shared the other 56.<br />\nHopkins' only first place came<br />\nfrom senior April Savoye in the<br />\nlong jump, while second places<br />\nwere earned by the 4 X 100 meter<br />\nrelay (Perlinn, McGinn, Savoye,<br />\nand Johnson), the 4 X 400 meter<br />\nrelay (Perlinn, Gifford, Savoye,<br />\nand McGinn), McGinn in the<br />\n800, Perlinn in the 100 and 400<br />\nmeter hurdles, and Johnson in the<br />\ntriple jump. The meet also produced six more qualifying times<br />\nfor Perlinn and Valerie Wilson in<br />\nthe 100 meter hurdles, McGinn in<br />\nthe 400, Gifford and Johnson in<br />\nthe 200, and Bardsley in the<br />\n1500.<br />\nOne reason for the women's<br />\nsudden success is that they are no<br />\nlonger a team of only freshmen<br />\nand sophomores, which has been<br />\nthe status quo for the past few<br />\nyears. The higher number of<br />\ntalented veterans backed by a<br /><br />\ngood group of freshmen has made<br />\nit possible for Hopkins to be competitive in every race this year. In<br />\norder to further improve,<br />\nCoaches Green and Simonsick<br />\nhave implemented something new<br />\nto the track program: films.<br />\nEvery race is videotaped, and on<br />\nthe next day, the girls watch their<br />\nprevious performances, looking<br />\nfor weaknesses that can be corrected. The main benefit of the<br />\ntapes is probably for the sprinters<br />\nand jumpers, who can learn from<br />\nwatching relay hand-offs, hurdling and jumping techniques, and<br />\nblock starts.

As<br />\nyou admire your pearly whites in<br />\nthe mirror, you feel something<br />\nbrushing up against the sink. You<br />\nlook down, and unfortunately, it's<br />\nyour stomach. Something is<br />\nwrong. You realize that turning<br />\n150 pages of a Calculus book<br />\ndoes not build a Daytona Beach<br />\nbody. Looks like it's time to hit<br />\nthe gym.<br />\nThis \"reflection depression\" is<br />\nnot restricted to Hopkins but<br />\nstrikes each morning throughout<br />\nthe country. In the past 40 years<br />\nbodybuilding has changed the<br />\nlives of millions of Americans. It<br />\nhas been proven that physical<br />\nfitness leads to a longer life,<br />\ngreater self-satisfaction, and (not<br />\nthat it matters at Hopkins) a better sex life. So for all you<br />\ndepression\"<br />\n\"reflections<br />\ndepressees (and for those of you<br />\nwho want a better sex life), this<br />\narticle was written just for you,<br />\nIdeally, before starting a<br />\nworkout you should begin with a<br />\nfew minutes of stretching, rope<br />\njumping, or running in place.<br />\nThis gets your heart pumping and<br />\nyour blood coursing through your<br />\nveins. Stretching is especially important in preventing weighttraining injuries. Stretch with<br />\nsmooth, gliding motions. Do not<br />\nbounce or tug doing any of them.<br />\nAll stretches should be done 10<br />\ntimes, hold each for a count of<br />\nten.<br />\nThree good warm-ups are (11<br />\nHurdle stretch;(2) Revised Hurdle stretch (Get in the same position as the Hurdle stretch but instead of leaning back, attempt to<br />\ntouch for forehead to your knee<br />\nwithout bending your knee.);(3)<br />\nAttempted Split (Ow!) DON'T<br />\nOVERSTRETCH.<br />\nCAUTION: Overstretching can<br />\nstrain muscles and lead to delays<br />\nin your workout while you wait<br />\nfor muscles to heal.<br />\nNow that you have loosened<br />\nup, you are ready to start lifting<br />\nweights. Bodybuilding is not an<br />\nexact science. It's pretty much a<br />\nhit and miss affair, at least in the<br />\nbeginning. You can find tons of<br />\nconflicting advice available on the<br />\nsubject. The routine we propose<br />\ncomes from Robert Kennedy<br />\n(editor of Muscle Mag International). Beware of friendly advice. Although well-intentioned,<br />\nthe firmest beliefs are held by<br />\nthose with the least knowledge<br />\n(You could speak to some of our<br />\nTA's.)<br />\nThere are certain guidelines.<br />\nwhich should be followed. Beginners always want the fastest way<br />\nto build muscle and strength.<br />\nOften you end up taking bad advice and doing just the opposite.<br />\nYour progress is slowed and then<br />\nyou get tired and sick of the<br />\nwhole thing. Don't despair.<br />\nRemember the correct way is the<br />\nshortest one. Don't try shortcuts.<br />\nIn the beginning it is relatively<br />\nsimple. The initial workouts<br />\nshould be pretty short so enough<br />\ntime is allowed between workouts<br />\nfor the muscles to recuperate. If<br />\nnot, your torn-down cells won't be<br /><br />\nrepaired, and you can end up actually hurting yourself. You must<br />\nalso eat well regularly and get<br />\nenough sleep. If you are on the<br />\nmeal plan, my sympathy'.<br />\nOne thing you should consider<br />\ndoing is getting a check up. This<br />\nis the same for any sport requiring heavy exercise. You might<br />\nhave a heart condition or<br />\nsomething that could only be<br />\nlifting.<br />\nby<br />\ncomplicated<br />\nRemember you're doing this for<br />\nyour body so don't take any<br />\nchances with it. (Same for you<br />\nwho just want a better sex life.)<br />\nThose beginning to lift should<br />\nstart off on the Nautilus equipment. The reason for this is that<br />\nthe muscles in your body are not<br />\nprepared for the excessive strain<br />\nthat free weights can cause. The<br />\nNautilus machines allow controlled movements which lead to the<br />\nproper technique needed when<br />\nfree weights are used. They also<br />\ncondition your muscles properly<br />\nand provide a base on which to<br />\nbuild.<br />\nStart slowly. This can't be emphasized enough. Decide on what<br />\npart of your body you wish to<br />\nbuild. For a complete workout<br />\ndesign a schedule. A suggestion<br />\nis to use a four day schedule (ex:<br />\nMonday, Tuesday, Thursday,<br />\nand Friday).

Another thing before we<br />\nstart: decide what you want to get<br />\nout of your training. Do you want<br />\nbuild or strength or both?<br />\nFor build, you should stay with<br />\nlighter weight and do as many<br />\nrepetitions as you can up to<br />\ntwelve and then increase weights<br />\nuntil you can only do two reps.<br />\nThis technique is called<br />\npyramiding and works if done<br />\nproperly. Always do a warmdown set or two, making your last<br />\nwarm-down set equal to or lessthan your starting weight. A good<br />\nway to decide if you need to start<br />\nwith heavier weights is if you can<br />\ndo twelve reps with no strain.<br />\nFor strength, you should use<br />\nheavier weights and fewer reps<br />\nup to the point where you can't<br />\nlift anymore. A mixture of these<br />\ntwo techniques is ideal for a<br />\nsocially acceptable body. In each<br />\ncase you should work your<br />\nmuscles to the MMF point.

Marean<br />\nscored sixteen points, over half of<br />\nthe men's total of 28, who finished sixth overall in a field of fifteen. Besides Marean, no other<br />\nrunner was able to place. The<br />\nother twelve points came from the<br />\nfield events, as Tom Brennan<br />\nplaced fourth in the pole vault<br />\nwith an MAC-qualifying height<br />\nof 12 feet, Eric Hastings placed<br />\nfifth in the shotput and javelin,<br /><br />\nand Glenn Sabin placed fourth in<br />\nthe shot put.<br />\nLast Wednesday, April 13, the<br />\nmen finished second in their trimeet with 49 points, far behind<br />\nTowson (98 points) and barely<br />\nahead of UMBC (40 points). In<br />\nthe running events, Hopkins earned only one first place from<br />\nMarean in the 5000, and had second places from Paul Park in the<br />\n400 meter dash and Matt Hannon<br />\nin the 400 meter hurdles. The<br />\nJays got half of their total points<br />\nfrom their two outstanding<br />\nfreshmen throwers, Hastings and<br />\nSabin.
