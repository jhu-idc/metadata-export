ARMY WILL NEED OFFICERS<br />\nEngland's Experience Shows That College<br />\nMen Can Be Most Patriotic by Reserving Themselves for Positions<br />\nof Leadership, Says Dean.<br />\n<br />\nIn an interview with a representative of THE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nDean Murray P. Brush emphasized the idea brought forth in<br />\nthe notice recently sent to every<br />\nHopkins man by the President,<br />\nthe Dean and Lieut. Elliott\u2014the<br />\nidea that Hopkins students would<br />\nbe serving their country more effectively by enlisting in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps<br />\nthan by volunteering as privates.<br />\n\"When the Government begins<br />\nthe training of the enormous<br />\narmies which it is going to raise,\"<br />\nsaid the dean, \"it is going to<br />\nneed officers, and need them badly.<br />\nIt can obtain all the privates it<br />\nwants by conscription, but the material out of which officers can be<br />\ncreated is limited. College men,<br />\nby the training which they have<br />\nhad, are peculiarly adapted for<br />\nthis work, and they can turn their<br />\npatriotism to best account by preparing for it, rather than by succumbing to the very laudable desire of enlisting in the Government service immediately, as privates in the ranks.\"<br />\nOne of the great mistakes which<br />\nEngland made in the early part of<br />\nthe war, the dean went on to<br />\nshow, was that it permitted the<br />\nmajority of its university men to<br />\nenlist as privates when war was<br />\nfirst declared. Few of these men<br />\nsurvived the first few months of<br />\ncombat, and; as a consequence,<br />\nEngland has had to face a serious<br />\ndearth of the men from whose<br />\nranks its officers could be trained.<br />\n\"The men here should understand,\" said the dean, \"that by<br />\nremaining at the University and<br />\ndrilling with the corps, they are<br />\nin no sense shirking their patriotic obligations. Indeed, it may<br />\nbe said that they are showing<br />\ntheir patriotism in the wisest possible way. The great need of the<br />\nGovernment is not going to be for<br />\nprivates, but for men to drill<br />\nthose privates, and, for that purpose, enough officers will be<br />\nneeded almost to form an army<br />\nin themselves.\"<br />\nThe dean made clear that he<br />\nhad nothing but praise for the<br />\nmen who have already joined -the<br />\nUnited States forces. Tile promptness with which they have evidenced their love of country, he<br />\nsaid, does them the highest honor.<br />\n\"In the case of the men who have<br />\nnot yet decided just how they are<br />\ngoing to serve their country, however,\" he concluded, \"I should<br />\nstrongly advise careful consideration of what are going to be the<br />\nGovernment's most important<br />\nneeds.\"<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nEdited by FRANK MORLEY, with<br />\nthe co-operation of A.

Elliott,<br />\nurging every man who was physically fit to become a member of the<br />\ncorps,found its response on Thursday afternoon, when over forty<br />\nnew men lined up on the road in<br />\nfront of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding. Even before the letter<br />\nhad been sent out, Lieut. Elliott<br />\nreported, two or three score of<br />\nmen had made inquiries at his office in regard to joining the corps.<br />\nFriday brought another increase<br />\nto the ranks, and it is expected<br />\nthat on Monday enough men will<br />\nhave joined to permit of the official formation of another company. The addition of this company will bring the corps to full<br />\nbattalion strength.<br />\nFor the present, at least, Lieut.<br />\nElliott has decided to abandon the<br />\nWednesday, Thhrsday and Friday<br />\nlectures, and to devote the entire<br />\ntime of the corps to drilling and<br />\nmaneuvering. Lectures will be<br />\ngiven on days when for rain or<br />\nsome other reason the regular<br />\ndrill can not be held.<br />\nAs soon as the recruits have'<br />\nbeen fully organized, Lieut. Elliott<br />\nhopes to make provision for their<br />\nuniforms and other equipment.<br />\nThe great demand which has<br />\narisen for equipment, for the<br />\nUnited States Army makes it impossible to secure uniforms for<br />\nthe corps \"from the'Mar Department. The lieutenant hopes, however, to obtain them from Fort<br />\nHoward, where there is known to<br />\nbe a large supply.<br />\nWith the intense training now<br />\nbeing provided, Lieut. Elliott is of<br />\nthe opinion that many men from<br />\nthe corps will be able to take the<br />\nexamination for commissions as<br />\nsecond lieutenants in the reserve<br />\nby the end of the year. That such<br />\nofficers will be needed, and needed<br />\nin great quantity, when once the<br />\nGovernment has set about raising<br />\nand training its new armies, there<br />\ncan be no doubt. By preparing<br />\nthemselveg to serve in this capacity, the lieutenant thinks,<br />\nHopkins men are helping their<br />\ncountry in a very definite and<br />\nvery real way.<br />\n<br />\nThe following Hopkins graduate<br />\nscholarships and fellowships for<br />\n1917-1918 have been awarded:<br />\nJOHNSTON SCHOLARSHIPS.<br />\nW.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 16, 1917.<br />\n<br />\nPatriotism.<br />\n<br />\nThere are times when the<br />\ncourse of men becomes divested<br />\nof all the clogging, petty considerations of selfish expediency,<br />\ntimes when the elemental claims<br />\nof duty permit of no swerving<br />\nand no hesitation. There are times<br />\nwhen the individual becomes subordinate to the group, when the<br />\nsole question which each must<br />\nask himself is how best he can<br />\nanswer the call of his country.<br />\nThe war upon which the United<br />\nStates has embarked is a war<br />\nwaged for the preservation of the<br />\nhighest concepts of morality.<br />\nThere is no tinselled lure of territory or renown, no glamor of<br />\nglory; there is nothing to be<br />\ngained save the thing greatest of<br />\nall-the recognition of a might<br />\nhigher than the might of the<br />\nsword. The United States makes<br />\nwar not for itself, but for humanity.<br />\nHopkins men will know no faltering in the hour of their country's need. That has been proved<br />\nalready-proved by the list of<br />\nHopkins names in the roster of<br />\nthe army and navy, proved by the<br />\n4ong khaki line that'is drilling<br />\n-upon the Homewood campus. Nor<br />\nis the Hopkins patriotism the<br />\n<br />\nblatant patriotism blinded by its<br />\nown fervor to the obligations<br />\nwhich it entails. The day when<br />\nfighting meant romance has gone;<br />\nthe horror of twentieth century<br />\nwarfare have imprinted themselves far too deeply to -allow<br />\nthinking men to underestimate<br />\nwhat their service may mean.<br />\nOurs can be no hectic, evanescent<br />\nloyalty, to evaporate when the<br />\nfirst sacrifice must be met-it<br />\nmust be loyalty which knows all<br />\nthat it must give, though the giving include life itself.<br />\nYet, as men of a great university, our duty goes far beyond the<br />\nmere willingness to make sacrifice. It is not enough that we<br />\nact; we must think, and think<br />\nconstantly, of the reasons for the<br />\nact. We must ever hold before<br />\nour eyes the redeeming fact that<br />\nthe strife and hate into which the<br />\nworld is plunged is not the end<br />\nin itself, but only the bloody prelude to an era in which the ideals<br />\nof democracy and justice shall<br />\nreign in place of the ideals .of a<br />\nnarrow nationalism. Even in the<br />\nmidst of the dull, grinding routine of drill, drill which has for<br />\nits purpose the perfection of the<br />\ntechnique of slaying, we must<br />\nkeenly realize that we prepare<br />\nourselves for organized fratricide<br />\nonly that the blindness which<br />\npermits that fratricide may perish<br />\nfrom the earth.<br />\nIf we, as members of the world's<br />\nthinking class, allow our intelligence to be subverted to our passions; if, in the conflict that is to<br />\ncome, we think only of victory,<br />\nand not of the reason for victory,<br />\nthe contention of those, who, in<br />\nthe face of a virulent scorn unworthy of democracy, have contended that the United States<br />\ncould have better served humanity by steadfastly refusing to<br />\nmake war, under all provocations,<br />\nwill be justified. Upon us rests<br />\nthe duty of seeing that the calm<br />\nand noble spirit in which one of<br />\nthe greatest presidents the country has ever known made his<br />\nplea to Congress that war be declared is preserved, even when the<br />\nstruggle becomes the bitterest,<br />\neven when the blood-tang of the<br />\nbattlefield rises in our nostrils.<br />\nNor is the task a light one. It<br />\nis so easy to regard the nation<br />\nupon whom we make war as a<br />\nnation of Huns and Vandals, so<br />\nperilously easy to believe that, if<br />\nwe conquer that nation, we conquer all the evil that is extant in<br />\nour civilization. Yet we fight<br />\nGermany only because, under the<br />\nGerman government, the disregard for international law and<br />\ninternational morality which the<br />\npresent unorganized state of the<br />\nworld makes possible has become<br />\ncrystallized; for the men in the<br />\nGerman trenches, deluded by a<br />\nmilitant autocracy, believing that<br />\nthey 'defend their land against<br />\nselfish and mercenary invaders,<br />\nthere should be nothing but re-<br />\n<br />\nspect and sympathy.

The lumbering uncertainty with which Congress is preparing to set about the<br />\nwork of raising an army, the<br />\npresent urgent call for volunteersand the patriotic thrill which is<br />\nin the air, all make the temptation to enlist under the colors immediately a temptation exceedingly strong. Nevertheless, both the<br />\nexperience of other countries and<br />\nthe advice of American authorities indicate that college men can<br />\nserve their country best by remaining where they are.<br />\nThat the United States is going<br />\nto need officers very badly within<br />\nthe next few years is a fact selfevident. It is equally clear that<br />\nthe class of men who can be made<br />\ninto officers is small, and that of<br />\nthat class college men form a large<br />\npart. It was in recognition of<br />\nthis condition that the Reserve<br />\nOfficers' Training Corps were established at colleges throughout<br />\nthe country. Now that provision<br />\nhave been made at Hopkins for<br />\ndaily drills of two hours, Hopkins<br />\nstudents can prepare themselves<br />\nto serve as officers within a comparatively short time.<br />\n. The most obvious objection to<br />\njoining the Corps, of course, is<br />\nthat such action seems to be the<br />\neasiest way of fulfilling patriotic<br />\nobligations. Drilling in the Corps,<br />\nat present, means only the sacrifice of time, whereas enlistment in<br />\nsome unit of the Army and Navy<br />\nis a course which entails much<br />\ngreater sacrifice and, as a consequence, is more appealing. Nevertheless, occasions sometimes arise<br />\nwhen personal inclination, even<br />\nwhen it is prompted by the highest motives, should be subordinated to the general good. Joining the Corps instead of the regular service, after all, does not<br />\nmean that the sacrifices are<br />\navoided--they are only deferred.<br />\nAs Dean Brush has phrased it<br />\nelsewhere in this issue, for the<br />\nmen who have already enlisted<br />\nthere can only be the greatest and<br />\nmost deeply felt respect. But<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER joins with the<br />\nDean in urging those men \\\u2018'110 are<br />\nstill undecided as to their course<br />\nof action, for the sake of the patriotism which is moving them,<br />\nto join the Corps.<br />\n<br />\n4.30 P.

Hollander, president of the Hopkins<br />\nchapter, began his address by<br />\nstating that the science of surgery owed much of its development to work done upon the battlefield. He went on to trace the<br />\nrise of the science from its earliest crude applications to the present day, s<br />\nThe present war, Dr. Janeway<br />\nsaid, upset the calculations of<br />\nsurgeons as much as it did the<br />\ncalculations of those who said<br />\nthat another great war was impossible. Before 1914, medicine<br />\nhad been brought to the point<br />\nwhere it could easily prevent infection in the great majority of<br />\nwounds. In modern warfare, however, the range of artillery, and<br />\nthe distance which wounded men<br />\nhad to be removed from the front<br />\nbefore they could be adequately<br />\ntreated, made it impossible to prevent infection, and, as a consequence, surgery had to\u2022 fight an<br />\nenemy which it had thought long<br />\nsince vanquished. That lives could<br />\nnow be saved without amputation<br />\nof the wounded members, even<br />\nafter infection had set in, Dr.<br />\nJaneway said, was .one of the<br />\ngreatest results medicine has ever<br />\nachieved.<br />\nDr. Janeway paid tribute to the<br />\nwork of the Medical Department<br />\nof the United States Army, which,<br />\nhe said, had done such splendid<br />\nwork in stamping out disease in<br />\nthe Panama Canal Zone and in<br />\nthe Philippines.<br />\nThe present war, he said, in conclud lug his address was the first<br />\nwar for several centuries in which<br />\nthe flag of the Red Cross had not<br />\nbeen respected by a belligerent nation.<br />\n<br />\nThe news of the death of,\"Diamond Jim\" Brady, founder of the<br />\nBrady Urological Institute at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, caused<br />\ndeep sorrow throughout the University upon which his generosity<br />\nhas been so greatly visited. That<br />\ngenerosity, it is said, has not<br />\nstopped even with death, for it is<br />\nrumored that Mr. Brady's will<br />\ncontains a large bequest to be<br />\nused to maintain the institute<br />\nwhich he established.<br />\nMr. Brady's closest friend in<br />\nBaltimore is Dr. Hugh Young,<br />\nwho, in the millionaire's opinion,<br />\nsaved his life when he came to<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital in<br />\n1912. It was Dr. Young who<br />\nfirst broached the project of an<br />\ninstitute of urological surgery,<br />\nand who awakened Mr. Brady's<br />\ninterest in the plan.<br />\nAs soon as he decided to establish the institute, Mr. Brady commissioned Dr. Young to make a<br />\nthorough study of hospitals in<br />\nthis country and in Europe, in<br />\norder to ascertain the best way<br />\nin which the institute could be<br />\ndeveloped. On Dr. Young's return, plans fqr the building were<br />\nperfected, and the work of erection was begun immediately.<br />\nThe dedication ceremonies of<br />\nthe James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute\u2014the second institution of its kind in the world<br />\n\u2014were held in April, 1915. At<br />\nthe banquet following the dedication, Mr. Brady made his famous<br />\nremark that, if millionaires could<br />\nappreciate how much better it<br />\nwas to build memorials to themselves while they were alive, there<br />\nwould be very few memorials<br />\nbuilt to them after they were<br />\ndead.<br />\nThe cost of establishing the institute amounted to $300,000, and,<br />\nthroughout his life, Mr. Brady<br />\nwas constantly providing for its<br />\nmaintenance and for the extension of its work.<br />\n<br />\nIn the organization that Maryland is making in preparation for<br />\nthe call to service, three calls have<br />\nbeen made upon President Frank<br />\nJ. Goodnow.<br />\nWhen Maryland decided to take<br />\na census of her men, Dr. Goodnow was made a member of the<br />\ncommittee appointed to take<br />\ncharge of the work. This committee has set about organizing<br />\na systematic inventory of Maryland's resources, and their work<br />\nis nearing completion.<br />\nThen came the call to Maryland<br />\nfor 800 men for the Navy, and a<br />\ngeneral organization was planned<br />\nfor the carrying on of all forms<br />\nof recruiting. Dr. Goodnow was<br />\nasked to serve as chairman of the<br />\norganization.<br />\nFinally, when Baltimore saw<br />\nthat war would cause hardship<br />\nto some or its population, and<br />\nwhen the committee for the relief of the poor was organized for<br />\nthe purpose of raising $1,500,000,<br />\nDr. Goodnow was again asked to<br />\nserve.<br />\nDr. Goodnow has expressed<br />\nhimself as unqualifiedly in favor<br />\nof the selective draft system now<br />\nunder consideration in Congress.<br />\n\"I certainly feel,\" he said recently, \"that this is no time for<br />\ndivided counsel and that the<br />\nMaryland delegation should give<br />\nPresident Wilson: the power he<br />\nasks. There is no doubt in my<br />\nmind that that is necessary if this<br />\nwar is to be conducted vigorously.<br />\n\"The selective draft is the only<br />\nsensible way in which to raise an<br />\narmy, I think. Its merits do not<br />\ndepend in any measure on whether<br />\nsuch an army, could be raised by<br />\nvolunteer enlistment. I don't<br />\nthink that should form any part<br />\nof the discussion at all. It is not<br />\na volunteer army that is wanted.<br />\nWhat is wanted is the power to<br />\nselect the men who are needed for<br />\nthe army.<br />\n\"H. G. Wells has said somewhere that there are only four<br />\nor five great nations that are capable of conducting a modern<br />\nwar. War today is so much a<br />\nmatter of industrial organization.<br />\nIt would be absurd to cripple the<br />\nindustrial organization of the<br />\ncountry and still further cripple<br />\nwhat little agricultural organization we have by'raising an army<br />\nby the -volunteer system. England found the absurdity of this<br />\nwhen she first went into the war.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of<br />\nus. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful pee pie into war; into the<br />\nmost terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the<br />\nbalance. But the right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for the<br />\nthings which we have always carried nearest our hearts\u2014 for democracy, for<br />\nthe right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion<br />\nof right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to<br />\nall nations and make the world itself at last free. To such a task we can<br />\ndedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that<br />\nwe have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when<br />\nAmerica is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that<br />\ngave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

Ames, professor<br />\nof physics, has been appointed by<br />\nPresident Wilson as'chairman of<br />\na commission to investigate all<br />\nquestions dealing with scientific<br />\nresearch in modern war problems,<br />\nand is already on his way to Europe. Dr. Harry Fielding Reid,<br />\nprofessor of dynamic geology and<br />\ngeography, is another member of<br />\nthe commission.<br />\nThe commission was appointed<br />\nby the President upon the advice<br />\nof the National Research Council,<br />\nand forms one of the most concrete proofs that the United States<br />\nintends to co-ordinate with the<br />\nAllies to the fullest extent which<br />\nthe Government has offered.<br />\nNo definite information has been<br />\nfurnished as to the exact nature<br />\nof the problems to which the commission will confine itself. That<br />\nthe modern battlefield has many<br />\nsuch problems to offer\u2014problems<br />\nwhich can be adequately investigated only by trained minds\u2014has<br />\nbeen amply proved since August,<br />\n1914. Nor, it is thought, have<br />\nthe resources of modern science<br />\nbeen brought to bear upon certain aspects of warfare as fully as<br />\nis possible. To ascertain all opportunities for the further introduction of the discoveries of the<br />\nlaboratory into the methods of<br />\narmies, and, at the same time to<br />\n'bring other problems developed<br />\nby the war baCk to American laboratories to be investigated, is<br />\nthe object of the commission.<br />\nProfessor Ames is peculiarly<br />\nwell fitted to head such a commission. Taking his A. B. degree at<br />\nthis University in 1886, and his<br />\nPh. D. in 1890, he has since been<br />\nmade an honorary member of the<br />\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain, a member of the French Physical Society, a member of the Na:<br />\ntional Academy of Sciences, fellow of the American Academy of<br />\nArts and Sciences, assistant editor of the Astrophysical Journal<br />\n<br />\nand associate editor of the American Journal of Science.<br />\nDuring the last year, Dr. Ames<br />\nhas been actively engaged in the<br />\nwork of the national Advisory<br />\nCommittee on Aeronautics. Another fact which makes his selection as chairman or the commission a particularly appropriate<br />\none is that he has made frequent<br />\nvisits to France and England and<br />\nis in close relation with the leading scientists in both countries.<br />\nDr. Reid, the other Hopkins<br />\nmember of the commission, is also<br />\na member of the National Academy of Sciences. It is said that<br />\nDr. Reid, while in Europe, will<br />\nmake a very thorough study of<br />\nphotography from aeroplanes \u2014<br />\none of the most important works<br />\nin which the modern army en-.<br />\ngages. Dr. Reid brings to his<br />\nwork experience as one of the leading seismologists of America.<br />\nAssociated with Drs. Ames and<br />\nReid on the commission are Dr.<br />\nRichard P.

Speaker.<br />\n<br />\nGeneral Wood Believes They Can Do<br />\nMore Good by Drilling Within Institutions Than by Discontinuing Their Work.<br />\n<br />\n307 N. CHARLES ST.<br />\n<br />\nThe annual Triangular Debate<br />\nbetween the Universities of North<br />\nCarolina and Virginia and Hopkins has been indefinitely suspended. This action was taken<br />\nby the Debating Council, although<br />\nthe debate would not have in any<br />\nway interfered with military<br />\ntraining, in order that the suspension of intercollegiate activities by the University might be<br />\nmade a uniform policy.<br />\nWord was received from the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia during the<br />\nEaster vacation that that university would be forced to cancel its<br />\ndebates on account of the intensity of the training which it was<br />\nabout to inaugurate for its students. Soon afterwards a telegram was received from the University of North Carolina, asking<br />\nif Hopkins was in favor of having<br />\na dual debate.<br />\nThe council for a time contemplated accepting this proposition..<br />\nThe sentiment of the debaters<br />\nthemselves, however, was found<br />\nto be in favor of cancelling the<br />\nUniversity debates as well as the<br />\nUniversity athletics, as a matter<br />\nof general policy, and North Carolina was informed to that effect.<br />\nWhether the triangle is to be<br />\nresumed next year, is, of course,<br />\nentirely dependent upon the developments which the war may<br />\nbring forth, as well as upon the<br />\nattitude which the University<br />\ntakes in regard to all its activities.<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday evening, at 8 o'clock,<br />\nin the Civil Engineering Building,<br />\nHenry C. Evans will represent<br />\nHopkins in an oratorial contest<br />\nwith three other State colleges<br />\nupon various aspects of the proposed league to enforce peace.<br />\n\u2022The contest, which is held nnder the auspices of the Intercollegiate Peace Association, will<br />\nhave<br />\nin cash as its prize. In<br />\naddition to the money, the winner<br />\nwill obtain the privilege of representing Maryland in the group<br />\ncontest of the South Atlantic<br />\nStates.<br />\nThis Friday night will be the<br />\nlast occasion in which Hopkins<br />\nwill compete with other colleges<br />\nin any manner for the remainder<br />\nof the year\u2014perhaps, for several<br />\nyears to come. In view of this<br />\nconsideration, as well as of the<br />\nfact that a league to enforce<br />\npeace is coming more and more<br />\ninto prominence in American<br />\nthought as a possible result of the<br />\npresent war, it is expected that<br />\nthe contest will be unusually well<br />\nattended.<br />\n<br />\nThat college men can be of most<br />\nservice to their country by stay- Baltimore's Only Exclusive Hosiery Shop<br />\ning where they are and taking adfor Men<br />\nvantage of the opportunities for<br />\n215 N.

In general,<br />\nthe declaration of war has had a two-fold effect in collegiate circles:<br />\nintercollegiate contests are being everywhere suspended, and every<br />\nfacility is being provided for the drilling of students upon the university grounds. In addition, many college men have already enlisted in various units of United States Army and Navy.'<br />\nWhile these volunteers are unreservedly receiving credit for the<br />\nyear's work, it is understood to be the sentiment among university<br />\nauthorities that students can do most good by enlisting in the various<br />\nunits already organized within the campus. Especial emphasis is<br />\nbeing laid upon the desirability of enlistment in the various Reserve<br />\nOfficers' Training Corps already established by. the Government at<br />\nmany universities, and it is expected that the reopening of the various<br />\ninstitutions after the Easter vacation will see the corps enormously<br />\nenlarged.<br />\nAmong the universities which have completely suspended all intercollegiate athletics in order that military training may go on unhampered are Yale, Harvard, Cornell, Columbia and Princeton. Other<br />\ncolleges are following suit, one after the other. Before the end of the<br />\nweek, the suspension of Intercollegiate athletics may have become<br />\ngeneral.<br />\nThe Intercollegiate Intelligence Bureau has been doing remarkable<br />\nwork during the past few weeks, with the result that there will soon<br />\nbe in the hands of the Government a comprehensive index of practically all the college alumni and students in the United States, with<br />\nan indication,of the special work for which they are fitted. This index, it is understood, will be of tremendous value in the industrial<br />\nmobilization which is already taking place.<br />\nSome idea of the zeal with Which the colleges are preparing to<br />\nserve the country may be obtained from the movements already on<br />\nfoot in the following institutions:<br />\nHARVARD.<br />\nOver 1,000 men are enlisted in<br />\nthe Officers' Reserve Training<br />\nCorps, and are drilling daily.<br />\nThe university has officially notified the Government that it<br />\nstands ready at any time to turn<br />\nover all its equipment for use as<br />\na school for the development of<br />\nofficers, with summer camp work<br />\nheld at the university instead of<br />\nat Plattsburg.

ARMY WILL NEED OFFICERS<br />\nEngland's Experience Shows That College<br />\nMen Can Be Most Patriotic by Reserving Themselves for Positions<br />\nof Leadership, Says Dean.<br /><br />\nIn an interview with a representative of THE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nDean Murray P. Brush emphasized the idea brought forth in<br />\nthe notice recently sent to every<br />\nHopkins man by the President,<br />\nthe Dean and Lieut. Elliott\u2014the<br />\nidea that Hopkins students would<br />\nbe serving their country more effectively by enlisting in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps<br />\nthan by volunteering as privates.<br />\n\"When the Government begins<br />\nthe training of the enormous<br />\narmies which it is going to raise,\"<br />\nsaid the dean, \"it is going to<br />\nneed officers, and need them badly.<br />\nIt can obtain all the privates it<br />\nwants by conscription, but the material out of which officers can be<br />\ncreated is limited. College men,<br />\nby the training which they have<br />\nhad, are peculiarly adapted for<br />\nthis work, and they can turn their<br />\npatriotism to best account by preparing for it, rather than by succumbing to the very laudable desire of enlisting in the Government service immediately, as privates in the ranks.\"<br />\nOne of the great mistakes which<br />\nEngland made in the early part of<br />\nthe war, the dean went on to<br />\nshow, was that it permitted the<br />\nmajority of its university men to<br />\nenlist as privates when war was<br />\nfirst declared. Few of these men<br />\nsurvived the first few months of<br />\ncombat, and; as a consequence,<br />\nEngland has had to face a serious<br />\ndearth of the men from whose<br />\nranks its officers could be trained.<br />\n\"The men here should understand,\" said the dean, \"that by<br />\nremaining at the University and<br />\ndrilling with the corps, they are<br />\nin no sense shirking their patriotic obligations. Indeed, it may<br />\nbe said that they are showing<br />\ntheir patriotism in the wisest possible way. The great need of the<br />\nGovernment is not going to be for<br />\nprivates, but for men to drill<br />\nthose privates, and, for that purpose, enough officers will be<br />\nneeded almost to form an army<br />\nin themselves.\"<br />\nThe dean made clear that he<br />\nhad nothing but praise for the<br />\nmen who have already joined -the<br />\nUnited States forces. Tile promptness with which they have evidenced their love of country, he<br />\nsaid, does them the highest honor.<br />\n\"In the case of the men who have<br />\nnot yet decided just how they are<br />\ngoing to serve their country, however,\" he concluded, \"I should<br />\nstrongly advise careful consideration of what are going to be the<br />\nGovernment's most important<br />\nneeds.\"<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nEdited by FRANK MORLEY, with<br />\nthe co-operation of A.

Army.<br /><br />\nFifty-Two Graduate Scholarships and<br />\nFellowships Awarded for 1917-18.<br />\nBruce and Rayner Fellows<br />\nto Be Named Later.<br /><br />\nWith fifty recruits to swell its<br />\nranks, with daily drills from 4 to<br />\n6 and half-day maneuvets on Saturdays, and with the definite<br />\nknowledge that its men will be<br />\nsoon needed by the Government<br />\nto help in raising the enormous<br />\nnew army for which the President has asked, the Hopkins Reserve Officers' Training Corps is<br />\ndeveloping with unusual rapidity.<br />\nThe letter sent to every undergraduate by President Goodnow,<br />\nDean Brush and Lieut. Elliott,<br />\nurging every man who was physically fit to become a member of the<br />\ncorps,found its response on Thursday afternoon, when over forty<br />\nnew men lined up on the road in<br />\nfront of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding. Even before the letter<br />\nhad been sent out, Lieut. Elliott<br />\nreported, two or three score of<br />\nmen had made inquiries at his office in regard to joining the corps.<br />\nFriday brought another increase<br />\nto the ranks, and it is expected<br />\nthat on Monday enough men will<br />\nhave joined to permit of the official formation of another company. The addition of this company will bring the corps to full<br />\nbattalion strength.<br />\nFor the present, at least, Lieut.<br />\nElliott has decided to abandon the<br />\nWednesday, Thhrsday and Friday<br />\nlectures, and to devote the entire<br />\ntime of the corps to drilling and<br />\nmaneuvering. Lectures will be<br />\ngiven on days when for rain or<br />\nsome other reason the regular<br />\ndrill can not be held.<br />\nAs soon as the recruits have'<br />\nbeen fully organized, Lieut. Elliott<br />\nhopes to make provision for their<br />\nuniforms and other equipment.<br />\nThe great demand which has<br />\narisen for equipment, for the<br />\nUnited States Army makes it impossible to secure uniforms for<br />\nthe corps \"from the'Mar Department. The lieutenant hopes, however, to obtain them from Fort<br />\nHoward, where there is known to<br />\nbe a large supply.<br />\nWith the intense training now<br />\nbeing provided, Lieut. Elliott is of<br />\nthe opinion that many men from<br />\nthe corps will be able to take the<br />\nexamination for commissions as<br />\nsecond lieutenants in the reserve<br />\nby the end of the year. That such<br />\nofficers will be needed, and needed<br />\nin great quantity, when once the<br />\nGovernment has set about raising<br />\nand training its new armies, there<br />\ncan be no doubt. By preparing<br />\nthemselveg to serve in this capacity, the lieutenant thinks,<br />\nHopkins men are helping their<br />\ncountry in a very definite and<br />\nvery real way.<br /><br />\nThe following Hopkins graduate<br />\nscholarships and fellowships for<br />\n1917-1918 have been awarded:<br />\nJOHNSTON SCHOLARSHIPS.<br />\nW.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 16, 1917.<br /><br />\nPatriotism.<br /><br />\nThere are times when the<br />\ncourse of men becomes divested<br />\nof all the clogging, petty considerations of selfish expediency,<br />\ntimes when the elemental claims<br />\nof duty permit of no swerving<br />\nand no hesitation. There are times<br />\nwhen the individual becomes subordinate to the group, when the<br />\nsole question which each must<br />\nask himself is how best he can<br />\nanswer the call of his country.<br />\nThe war upon which the United<br />\nStates has embarked is a war<br />\nwaged for the preservation of the<br />\nhighest concepts of morality.<br />\nThere is no tinselled lure of territory or renown, no glamor of<br />\nglory; there is nothing to be<br />\ngained save the thing greatest of<br />\nall-the recognition of a might<br />\nhigher than the might of the<br />\nsword. The United States makes<br />\nwar not for itself, but for humanity.<br />\nHopkins men will know no faltering in the hour of their country's need. That has been proved<br />\nalready-proved by the list of<br />\nHopkins names in the roster of<br />\nthe army and navy, proved by the<br />\n4ong khaki line that'is drilling<br />\n-upon the Homewood campus. Nor<br />\nis the Hopkins patriotism the<br /><br />\nblatant patriotism blinded by its<br />\nown fervor to the obligations<br />\nwhich it entails. The day when<br />\nfighting meant romance has gone;<br />\nthe horror of twentieth century<br />\nwarfare have imprinted themselves far too deeply to -allow<br />\nthinking men to underestimate<br />\nwhat their service may mean.<br />\nOurs can be no hectic, evanescent<br />\nloyalty, to evaporate when the<br />\nfirst sacrifice must be met-it<br />\nmust be loyalty which knows all<br />\nthat it must give, though the giving include life itself.<br />\nYet, as men of a great university, our duty goes far beyond the<br />\nmere willingness to make sacrifice. It is not enough that we<br />\nact; we must think, and think<br />\nconstantly, of the reasons for the<br />\nact. We must ever hold before<br />\nour eyes the redeeming fact that<br />\nthe strife and hate into which the<br />\nworld is plunged is not the end<br />\nin itself, but only the bloody prelude to an era in which the ideals<br />\nof democracy and justice shall<br />\nreign in place of the ideals .of a<br />\nnarrow nationalism. Even in the<br />\nmidst of the dull, grinding routine of drill, drill which has for<br />\nits purpose the perfection of the<br />\ntechnique of slaying, we must<br />\nkeenly realize that we prepare<br />\nourselves for organized fratricide<br />\nonly that the blindness which<br />\npermits that fratricide may perish<br />\nfrom the earth.<br />\nIf we, as members of the world's<br />\nthinking class, allow our intelligence to be subverted to our passions; if, in the conflict that is to<br />\ncome, we think only of victory,<br />\nand not of the reason for victory,<br />\nthe contention of those, who, in<br />\nthe face of a virulent scorn unworthy of democracy, have contended that the United States<br />\ncould have better served humanity by steadfastly refusing to<br />\nmake war, under all provocations,<br />\nwill be justified. Upon us rests<br />\nthe duty of seeing that the calm<br />\nand noble spirit in which one of<br />\nthe greatest presidents the country has ever known made his<br />\nplea to Congress that war be declared is preserved, even when the<br />\nstruggle becomes the bitterest,<br />\neven when the blood-tang of the<br />\nbattlefield rises in our nostrils.<br />\nNor is the task a light one. It<br />\nis so easy to regard the nation<br />\nupon whom we make war as a<br />\nnation of Huns and Vandals, so<br />\nperilously easy to believe that, if<br />\nwe conquer that nation, we conquer all the evil that is extant in<br />\nour civilization. Yet we fight<br />\nGermany only because, under the<br />\nGerman government, the disregard for international law and<br />\ninternational morality which the<br />\npresent unorganized state of the<br />\nworld makes possible has become<br />\ncrystallized; for the men in the<br />\nGerman trenches, deluded by a<br />\nmilitant autocracy, believing that<br />\nthey 'defend their land against<br />\nselfish and mercenary invaders,<br />\nthere should be nothing but re-<br /><br />\nspect and sympathy.

E.<br />\nof man for which our nation Building.<br />\nFriday, April 20<br />\nstands shall encompass the world.<br />\nThe Sensible Course.<br /><br />\nTo most Hopkins inen the question of what they should do in response to their country's call is<br />\njust now very acute. The lumbering uncertainty with which Congress is preparing to set about the<br />\nwork of raising an army, the<br />\npresent urgent call for volunteersand the patriotic thrill which is<br />\nin the air, all make the temptation to enlist under the colors immediately a temptation exceedingly strong. Nevertheless, both the<br />\nexperience of other countries and<br />\nthe advice of American authorities indicate that college men can<br />\nserve their country best by remaining where they are.<br />\nThat the United States is going<br />\nto need officers very badly within<br />\nthe next few years is a fact selfevident. It is equally clear that<br />\nthe class of men who can be made<br />\ninto officers is small, and that of<br />\nthat class college men form a large<br />\npart. It was in recognition of<br />\nthis condition that the Reserve<br />\nOfficers' Training Corps were established at colleges throughout<br />\nthe country. Now that provision<br />\nhave been made at Hopkins for<br />\ndaily drills of two hours, Hopkins<br />\nstudents can prepare themselves<br />\nto serve as officers within a comparatively short time.<br />\n. The most obvious objection to<br />\njoining the Corps, of course, is<br />\nthat such action seems to be the<br />\neasiest way of fulfilling patriotic<br />\nobligations. Drilling in the Corps,<br />\nat present, means only the sacrifice of time, whereas enlistment in<br />\nsome unit of the Army and Navy<br />\nis a course which entails much<br />\ngreater sacrifice and, as a consequence, is more appealing. Nevertheless, occasions sometimes arise<br />\nwhen personal inclination, even<br />\nwhen it is prompted by the highest motives, should be subordinated to the general good. Joining the Corps instead of the regular service, after all, does not<br />\nmean that the sacrifices are<br />\navoided--they are only deferred.<br />\nAs Dean Brush has phrased it<br />\nelsewhere in this issue, for the<br />\nmen who have already enlisted<br />\nthere can only be the greatest and<br />\nmost deeply felt respect. But<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER joins with the<br />\nDean in urging those men \\\u2018'110 are<br />\nstill undecided as to their course<br />\nof action, for the sake of the patriotism which is moving them,<br />\nto join the Corps.<br /><br />\n4.30 P.

Hollander, president of the Hopkins<br />\nchapter, began his address by<br />\nstating that the science of surgery owed much of its development to work done upon the battlefield. He went on to trace the<br />\nrise of the science from its earliest crude applications to the present day, s<br />\nThe present war, Dr. Janeway<br />\nsaid, upset the calculations of<br />\nsurgeons as much as it did the<br />\ncalculations of those who said<br />\nthat another great war was impossible. Before 1914, medicine<br />\nhad been brought to the point<br />\nwhere it could easily prevent infection in the great majority of<br />\nwounds. In modern warfare, however, the range of artillery, and<br />\nthe distance which wounded men<br />\nhad to be removed from the front<br />\nbefore they could be adequately<br />\ntreated, made it impossible to prevent infection, and, as a consequence, surgery had to\u2022 fight an<br />\nenemy which it had thought long<br />\nsince vanquished. That lives could<br />\nnow be saved without amputation<br />\nof the wounded members, even<br />\nafter infection had set in, Dr.<br />\nJaneway said, was .one of the<br />\ngreatest results medicine has ever<br />\nachieved.<br />\nDr. Janeway paid tribute to the<br />\nwork of the Medical Department<br />\nof the United States Army, which,<br />\nhe said, had done such splendid<br />\nwork in stamping out disease in<br />\nthe Panama Canal Zone and in<br />\nthe Philippines.<br />\nThe present war, he said, in conclud lug his address was the first<br />\nwar for several centuries in which<br />\nthe flag of the Red Cross had not<br />\nbeen respected by a belligerent nation.<br /><br />\nThe news of the death of,\"Diamond Jim\" Brady, founder of the<br />\nBrady Urological Institute at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, caused<br />\ndeep sorrow throughout the University upon which his generosity<br />\nhas been so greatly visited. That<br />\ngenerosity, it is said, has not<br />\nstopped even with death, for it is<br />\nrumored that Mr. Brady's will<br />\ncontains a large bequest to be<br />\nused to maintain the institute<br />\nwhich he established.<br />\nMr. Brady's closest friend in<br />\nBaltimore is Dr. Hugh Young,<br />\nwho, in the millionaire's opinion,<br />\nsaved his life when he came to<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital in<br />\n1912. It was Dr. Young who<br />\nfirst broached the project of an<br />\ninstitute of urological surgery,<br />\nand who awakened Mr. Brady's<br />\ninterest in the plan.<br />\nAs soon as he decided to establish the institute, Mr. Brady commissioned Dr. Young to make a<br />\nthorough study of hospitals in<br />\nthis country and in Europe, in<br />\norder to ascertain the best way<br />\nin which the institute could be<br />\ndeveloped. On Dr. Young's return, plans fqr the building were<br />\nperfected, and the work of erection was begun immediately.<br />\nThe dedication ceremonies of<br />\nthe James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute\u2014the second institution of its kind in the world<br />\n\u2014were held in April, 1915. At<br />\nthe banquet following the dedication, Mr. Brady made his famous<br />\nremark that, if millionaires could<br />\nappreciate how much better it<br />\nwas to build memorials to themselves while they were alive, there<br />\nwould be very few memorials<br />\nbuilt to them after they were<br />\ndead.<br />\nThe cost of establishing the institute amounted to $300,000, and,<br />\nthroughout his life, Mr. Brady<br />\nwas constantly providing for its<br />\nmaintenance and for the extension of its work.<br /><br />\nIn the organization that Maryland is making in preparation for<br />\nthe call to service, three calls have<br />\nbeen made upon President Frank<br />\nJ. Goodnow.<br />\nWhen Maryland decided to take<br />\na census of her men, Dr. Goodnow was made a member of the<br />\ncommittee appointed to take<br />\ncharge of the work. This committee has set about organizing<br />\na systematic inventory of Maryland's resources, and their work<br />\nis nearing completion.<br />\nThen came the call to Maryland<br />\nfor 800 men for the Navy, and a<br />\ngeneral organization was planned<br />\nfor the carrying on of all forms<br />\nof recruiting. Dr. Goodnow was<br />\nasked to serve as chairman of the<br />\norganization.<br />\nFinally, when Baltimore saw<br />\nthat war would cause hardship<br />\nto some or its population, and<br />\nwhen the committee for the relief of the poor was organized for<br />\nthe purpose of raising $1,500,000,<br />\nDr. Goodnow was again asked to<br />\nserve.<br />\nDr. Goodnow has expressed<br />\nhimself as unqualifiedly in favor<br />\nof the selective draft system now<br />\nunder consideration in Congress.<br />\n\"I certainly feel,\" he said recently, \"that this is no time for<br />\ndivided counsel and that the<br />\nMaryland delegation should give<br />\nPresident Wilson: the power he<br />\nasks. There is no doubt in my<br />\nmind that that is necessary if this<br />\nwar is to be conducted vigorously.<br />\n\"The selective draft is the only<br />\nsensible way in which to raise an<br />\narmy, I think. Its merits do not<br />\ndepend in any measure on whether<br />\nsuch an army, could be raised by<br />\nvolunteer enlistment. I don't<br />\nthink that should form any part<br />\nof the discussion at all. It is not<br />\na volunteer army that is wanted.<br />\nWhat is wanted is the power to<br />\nselect the men who are needed for<br />\nthe army.<br />\n\"H. G. Wells has said somewhere that there are only four<br />\nor five great nations that are capable of conducting a modern<br />\nwar. War today is so much a<br />\nmatter of industrial organization.<br />\nIt would be absurd to cripple the<br />\nindustrial organization of the<br />\ncountry and still further cripple<br />\nwhat little agricultural organization we have by'raising an army<br />\nby the -volunteer system. England found the absurdity of this<br />\nwhen she first went into the war.\"<br /><br />\n\"There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of<br />\nus. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful pee pie into war; into the<br />\nmost terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the<br />\nbalance. But the right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for the<br />\nthings which we have always carried nearest our hearts\u2014 for democracy, for<br />\nthe right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion<br />\nof right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to<br />\nall nations and make the world itself at last free. To such a task we can<br />\ndedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that<br />\nwe have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when<br />\nAmerica is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that<br />\ngave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

Ames, professor<br />\nof physics, has been appointed by<br />\nPresident Wilson as'chairman of<br />\na commission to investigate all<br />\nquestions dealing with scientific<br />\nresearch in modern war problems,<br />\nand is already on his way to Europe. Dr. Harry Fielding Reid,<br />\nprofessor of dynamic geology and<br />\ngeography, is another member of<br />\nthe commission.<br />\nThe commission was appointed<br />\nby the President upon the advice<br />\nof the National Research Council,<br />\nand forms one of the most concrete proofs that the United States<br />\nintends to co-ordinate with the<br />\nAllies to the fullest extent which<br />\nthe Government has offered.<br />\nNo definite information has been<br />\nfurnished as to the exact nature<br />\nof the problems to which the commission will confine itself. That<br />\nthe modern battlefield has many<br />\nsuch problems to offer\u2014problems<br />\nwhich can be adequately investigated only by trained minds\u2014has<br />\nbeen amply proved since August,<br />\n1914. Nor, it is thought, have<br />\nthe resources of modern science<br />\nbeen brought to bear upon certain aspects of warfare as fully as<br />\nis possible. To ascertain all opportunities for the further introduction of the discoveries of the<br />\nlaboratory into the methods of<br />\narmies, and, at the same time to<br />\n'bring other problems developed<br />\nby the war baCk to American laboratories to be investigated, is<br />\nthe object of the commission.<br />\nProfessor Ames is peculiarly<br />\nwell fitted to head such a commission. Taking his A. B. degree at<br />\nthis University in 1886, and his<br />\nPh. D. in 1890, he has since been<br />\nmade an honorary member of the<br />\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain, a member of the French Physical Society, a member of the Na:<br />\ntional Academy of Sciences, fellow of the American Academy of<br />\nArts and Sciences, assistant editor of the Astrophysical Journal<br /><br />\nand associate editor of the American Journal of Science.<br />\nDuring the last year, Dr. Ames<br />\nhas been actively engaged in the<br />\nwork of the national Advisory<br />\nCommittee on Aeronautics. Another fact which makes his selection as chairman or the commission a particularly appropriate<br />\none is that he has made frequent<br />\nvisits to France and England and<br />\nis in close relation with the leading scientists in both countries.<br />\nDr. Reid, the other Hopkins<br />\nmember of the commission, is also<br />\na member of the National Academy of Sciences. It is said that<br />\nDr. Reid, while in Europe, will<br />\nmake a very thorough study of<br />\nphotography from aeroplanes \u2014<br />\none of the most important works<br />\nin which the modern army en-.<br />\ngages.

CHARLES ST.<br /><br />\nThe annual Triangular Debate<br />\nbetween the Universities of North<br />\nCarolina and Virginia and Hopkins has been indefinitely suspended. This action was taken<br />\nby the Debating Council, although<br />\nthe debate would not have in any<br />\nway interfered with military<br />\ntraining, in order that the suspension of intercollegiate activities by the University might be<br />\nmade a uniform policy.<br />\nWord was received from the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia during the<br />\nEaster vacation that that university would be forced to cancel its<br />\ndebates on account of the intensity of the training which it was<br />\nabout to inaugurate for its students. Soon afterwards a telegram was received from the University of North Carolina, asking<br />\nif Hopkins was in favor of having<br />\na dual debate.<br />\nThe council for a time contemplated accepting this proposition..<br />\nThe sentiment of the debaters<br />\nthemselves, however, was found<br />\nto be in favor of cancelling the<br />\nUniversity debates as well as the<br />\nUniversity athletics, as a matter<br />\nof general policy, and North Carolina was informed to that effect.<br />\nWhether the triangle is to be<br />\nresumed next year, is, of course,<br />\nentirely dependent upon the developments which the war may<br />\nbring forth, as well as upon the<br />\nattitude which the University<br />\ntakes in regard to all its activities.<br /><br />\nOn Friday evening, at 8 o'clock,<br />\nin the Civil Engineering Building,<br />\nHenry C. Evans will represent<br />\nHopkins in an oratorial contest<br />\nwith three other State colleges<br />\nupon various aspects of the proposed league to enforce peace.<br />\n\u2022The contest, which is held nnder the auspices of the Intercollegiate Peace Association, will<br />\nhave<br />\nin cash as its prize. In<br />\naddition to the money, the winner<br />\nwill obtain the privilege of representing Maryland in the group<br />\ncontest of the South Atlantic<br />\nStates.<br />\nThis Friday night will be the<br />\nlast occasion in which Hopkins<br />\nwill compete with other colleges<br />\nin any manner for the remainder<br />\nof the year\u2014perhaps, for several<br />\nyears to come. In view of this<br />\nconsideration, as well as of the<br />\nfact that a league to enforce<br />\npeace is coming more and more<br />\ninto prominence in American<br />\nthought as a possible result of the<br />\npresent war, it is expected that<br />\nthe contest will be unusually well<br />\nattended.<br /><br />\nThat college men can be of most<br />\nservice to their country by stay- Baltimore's Only Exclusive Hosiery Shop<br />\ning where they are and taking adfor Men<br />\nvantage of the opportunities for<br />\n215 N.

In general,<br />\nthe declaration of war has had a two-fold effect in collegiate circles:<br />\nintercollegiate contests are being everywhere suspended, and every<br />\nfacility is being provided for the drilling of students upon the university grounds. In addition, many college men have already enlisted in various units of United States Army and Navy.'<br />\nWhile these volunteers are unreservedly receiving credit for the<br />\nyear's work, it is understood to be the sentiment among university<br />\nauthorities that students can do most good by enlisting in the various<br />\nunits already organized within the campus. Especial emphasis is<br />\nbeing laid upon the desirability of enlistment in the various Reserve<br />\nOfficers' Training Corps already established by. the Government at<br />\nmany universities, and it is expected that the reopening of the various<br />\ninstitutions after the Easter vacation will see the corps enormously<br />\nenlarged.<br />\nAmong the universities which have completely suspended all intercollegiate athletics in order that military training may go on unhampered are Yale, Harvard, Cornell, Columbia and Princeton. Other<br />\ncolleges are following suit, one after the other. Before the end of the<br />\nweek, the suspension of Intercollegiate athletics may have become<br />\ngeneral.<br />\nThe Intercollegiate Intelligence Bureau has been doing remarkable<br />\nwork during the past few weeks, with the result that there will soon<br />\nbe in the hands of the Government a comprehensive index of practically all the college alumni and students in the United States, with<br />\nan indication,of the special work for which they are fitted. This index, it is understood, will be of tremendous value in the industrial<br />\nmobilization which is already taking place.<br />\nSome idea of the zeal with Which the colleges are preparing to<br />\nserve the country may be obtained from the movements already on<br />\nfoot in the following institutions:<br />\nHARVARD.<br />\nOver 1,000 men are enlisted in<br />\nthe Officers' Reserve Training<br />\nCorps, and are drilling daily.<br />\nThe university has officially notified the Government that it<br />\nstands ready at any time to turn<br />\nover all its equipment for use as<br />\na school for the development of<br />\nofficers, with summer camp work<br />\nheld at the university instead of<br />\nat Plattsburg.
