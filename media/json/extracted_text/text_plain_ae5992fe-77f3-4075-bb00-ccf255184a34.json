It is the one tradition of its kind that has grown up spontaneously on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus; it is practically the only means of creating class- soli-.<br />\nclarity; and above all, it's a mighty interesting game.<br />\nIts one serious drawback is that it takes valuable time right<br />\non the eve of the examinations; and this can easily be remedied.<br />\nThree or four days just before the finals count for a great deal<br />\nmore than the same number at some earlier date.

INITIATES FOUR<br />\nJUNIORS<br />\n<br />\nYOU can't always<br />\ntellfrom the Campus<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nHIS is a plain tale of a regular, everyday American undergraduate\u2014an engineer<br />\nfrom the University of Cincinnati, with a<br />\ncollege record much like that of thousands<br />\nof other students.<br />\n<br />\nHe got a kick out of playing varsity<br />\nbasketball. He caught on the baseball team.<br />\nWhen Cincinnati won at football, he celebrated with the rest. For a year he supervised the student cooperative bookshop. He<br />\nwas president of the Engineering Tribunal,<br />\nthe student governing body. In a word,<br />\nhe did the things well, that college students<br />\neverywhere like to do.<br />\nBut of the specialization which he was<br />\nto undertake at Westinghouse\u2014there wasn't<br />\na clue.<br />\nThe case of W. E. Thau is another<br />\nexample ofunforeseen opportunities afford2d<br />\nby such an organization to a man with a<br />\nhealthy aptitude for getting things done.<br />\nAfter the usual training given college<br />\nmen, he entered the General Engineering<br />\nDepartment. Later he became Engineer<br />\nin Charge of the Marine Section, handling<br />\nall marine and government application jobs.<br />\nThat was six years ago.<br />\nWithin Thau's time, the Diesel-electric<br />\ndrive has come to be the most advanced<br />\nmethod of ship propulsion. By means of<br />\n<br />\nit the man in the pilot house controls his<br />\nvessel as easily and surely as the driver of<br />\nan automobile. Also, this system uses<br />\nabout one-third the fuel of the ordinary<br />\nsteamship--an enormous saving in dollars,<br />\ncargo space and weight. Of all the Dieselelectric marine installations in the world<br />\ntoday 7o per cent are Westinghouse.<br />\nW. C. THAU<br />\n<br />\nThe question is sometimes asked:<br />\nWhen do young men get when they<br />\nenter a large industrial organization?<br />\nHave they opportunity to exercise creative<br />\ntalents? Or are they forced into narrow<br />\ngrooves?<br />\nThis series ofadvertisements throws light<br />\non these questions. Each advertisement<br />\ntakes up the record of a college man who<br />\ncame with the Westinghouse Company<br />\nwithin the last ten years or so, after<br />\ngraduation.<br />\n<br />\nThau and his associates determine how<br />\npractical is each application proposed. They<br />\ndiagnose each customer's needs. They<br />\nprescribe the right Westinghouse equipment.<br />\nFor instance, when the Government sent<br />\nword: \"Electrify the battleships Tennessee<br />\nand Colorado,\" the Marine Section was<br />\non the job to install turbine electric drives,<br />\nwhich helped to make these warcraft the<br />\nmost powerful units in the National<br />\nDefense.<br />\nOr the Clyde Steamship Line says:\"We<br />\nwant to load these lumber-cargo carriers<br />\nelectrically. How can we do it? What<br />\nwill it cost?\" Thau must figure to a fine<br />\npoint the exact requirements.<br />\nThus does the Westinghouse application<br />\nengineer combine commercial and engineering sense to advance the interests of the<br />\n<br />\ncustomer being served.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from p. 1, col. 1)<br />\n<br />\nof aHa, 1; Winner of H, 2; Member of Varsity Club, 3; Varsity<br />\nSeal, 3; Treasurer of Junior Class,<br />\n3.<br />\nEUGENE O'DUNNE, JR., '27<br />\nMember of NEWS-LETTER Business Staff, 2, 3; Business Manager,<br />\n3; IluSiness Manager of Hullabaloo. 4; Member of Barnstormers<br />\nClub, 3; Member of Tudor and<br />\nSmart Club; Member of Debating<br />\nCwincil, 3; Member of Tennis<br />\nrl 111, 2; Winner of tilt, 2; Varsi Seal, 3.<br />\n<br />\nWestinghouse<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MAY 7, 1926.<br />\n<br />\nMILITARY UNIT<br />\nINSPECTED TODAY<br />\n\u202231-afor B.

Such a reaction is natural at this<br />\ntime, when the interest and excitement have died down, and<br />\na record of cut classes with the finals only a few weeks off<br />\nis all that remains; with the possible exception of a few<br />\nbruises, to remind the participants of the joys of last week.<br />\nThese complaints are well founded, but we do not think<br />\nthat they justify either modification or abolition of the banquet<br />\nseason. Cali it childish or a waste of time as you will, we feel<br />\nthat as long as the Iundergraduate school remains, the banquet<br />\nseason has a definite place on'the campus. It is the one tradition of its kind that has grown up spontaneously on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus; it is practically the only means of creating class- soli-.<br />\nclarity; and above all, it's a mighty interesting game.<br />\nIts one serious drawback is that it takes valuable time right<br />\non the eve of the examinations; and this can easily be remedied.<br />\nThree or four days just before the finals count for a great deal<br />\nmore than the same number at some earlier date.

The ques-<br /><br />\nIf our memory serves us rightly, we distinctly recall that<br />\nin the early part of the year great satisfaction was expressed<br />\nover the fact that a method had been devised for preventing<br />\nconflicts in undergraduate affairs. There was placed in the<br />\nRegistrar's office a calendar upon which the date of future events<br />\nwere to be listed as soon as they were planned, with the understanding that as far as posisble no two affairs be held the same<br />\nnight.<br />\n-As far as we know the calendar is still there in good condition ; in fact, from all appearances it has never been touched.<br />\n\u2022 Last Friday, for instance, was the date of three events\u2014the<br />\nannual meeting of the Tudor and Stuart Club, the Junior Banquet, and the Enginiers' Dance. The dance and the Tudor<br />\nStuart meeting, of course, caused no conflict; but the engineers<br />\nwho attended the Junior Banquet were considerably delayed<br />\nin getting to the dance, and members of the Tudor Stuart Club<br />\nwho were juniors, were forced to make a definite choice between<br />\nattending either the meeting or their class banquet.<br />\nAlthough the matter was not one of great importance, it<br />\n,-aused a great deal of inconvenience.

He caught on the baseball team.<br />\nWhen Cincinnati won at football, he celebrated with the rest. For a year he supervised the student cooperative bookshop. He<br />\nwas president of the Engineering Tribunal,<br />\nthe student governing body. In a word,<br />\nhe did the things well, that college students<br />\neverywhere like to do.<br />\nBut of the specialization which he was<br />\nto undertake at Westinghouse\u2014there wasn't<br />\na clue.<br />\nThe case of W. E. Thau is another<br />\nexample ofunforeseen opportunities afford2d<br />\nby such an organization to a man with a<br />\nhealthy aptitude for getting things done.<br />\nAfter the usual training given college<br />\nmen, he entered the General Engineering<br />\nDepartment. Later he became Engineer<br />\nin Charge of the Marine Section, handling<br />\nall marine and government application jobs.<br />\nThat was six years ago.<br />\nWithin Thau's time, the Diesel-electric<br />\ndrive has come to be the most advanced<br />\nmethod of ship propulsion. By means of<br /><br />\nit the man in the pilot house controls his<br />\nvessel as easily and surely as the driver of<br />\nan automobile. Also, this system uses<br />\nabout one-third the fuel of the ordinary<br />\nsteamship--an enormous saving in dollars,<br />\ncargo space and weight.

THAU<br /><br />\nThe question is sometimes asked:<br />\nWhen do young men get when they<br />\nenter a large industrial organization?<br />\nHave they opportunity to exercise creative<br />\ntalents? Or are they forced into narrow<br />\ngrooves?<br />\nThis series ofadvertisements throws light<br />\non these questions. Each advertisement<br />\ntakes up the record of a college man who<br />\ncame with the Westinghouse Company<br />\nwithin the last ten years or so, after<br />\ngraduation.<br /><br />\nThau and his associates determine how<br />\npractical is each application proposed. They<br />\ndiagnose each customer's needs. They<br />\nprescribe the right Westinghouse equipment.<br />\nFor instance, when the Government sent<br />\nword: \"Electrify the battleships Tennessee<br />\nand Colorado,\" the Marine Section was<br />\non the job to install turbine electric drives,<br />\nwhich helped to make these warcraft the<br />\nmost powerful units in the National<br />\nDefense.<br />\nOr the Clyde Steamship Line says:\"We<br />\nwant to load these lumber-cargo carriers<br />\nelectrically.
