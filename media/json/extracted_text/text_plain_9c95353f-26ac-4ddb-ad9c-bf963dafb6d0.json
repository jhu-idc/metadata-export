I started in a thing<br />\ncalled Our Gang. I was Mickey.<br />\nWith my kids I found the<br />\nsecret is to not teach 'em but to<br />\nlearn from 'em. They're born<br />\nwith everything. And what most<br />\npeople do is squash it and take it<br />\naway from them. If you can just<br />\nlay back and trust whatever God<br />\nthere is in this universe that made<br />\nthem kids, made 'em to work<br />\nthat someplace there's more good<br />\nin us than bad or we'da never<br />\nmade it outta the trees in the<br />\nfirst place, we woulda killed each<br />\nother in the caves.

The<br />\ncamera pulls back to a full shot<br />\nof Robert Blake, in his<br />\nunderwear, doing chin-ups on a<br />\nbar wedged in a doorway. He<br />\ndrops off the bar, and moves to<br />\nthe kitchen. While lifting<br />\narm-weights, Blake cracks an egg<br />\ninto a glass, then drinks it. He<br />\nhits the floor and begins doing<br />\npush-ups, slowly pumping up and<br />\ndoWn. He dons a cop uniform,<br />\nthen goes outside and mounts his<br />\nElectra Glide police motorcycle.<br />\nHe roars away, spitting up dust<br />\nand gravel as he disappears down<br />\nthe long Arizona highway.<br />\nAn' about my father? He was<br />\npretty sick in the head. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, if he hadn'ta had<br />\nhis empire around him, my<br />\nmother and three kids, he would've<br />\nended up in the loony bin. But<br />\nhe had the kind of insanity that<br />\nonly in my later years I've come<br />\nto understand: It was one of the<br />\ngood things I got. He was a<br />\nmonster. He beat the shit out of<br />\nme from the day I was born, and<br />\nmy brother, my sister.<br />\nIn a scene from \"Baretta\",<br />\nBlake hustles out into the street<br />\nto apologize to a young woman<br />\nreporter who has been covering<br />\nan important homicide case, and<br />\nknows more about it than<br />\nBaretta knows.

Minutes<br />\npass. \"Yeah\", he says. Then he<br />\ngets up and leaves, walking<br />\nslowly, careful not to disturb the<br />\njanitor's solitude.<br />\n<br />\nI went into therapy. And the<br />\nthing I learned is this; I am what<br />\nI am. I'm crazy, I'm hostile, I got<br />\na lot of drive, I got a lot of hate,<br />\na lot of fear.

One day he got up when I<br />\nleft and walked out of his office<br />\nonto this little dirt area. Said, 'I'll<br />\nsee ya tomorrow.' It was the first<br />\n<br />\ntime he ever walked me out. And<br />\nI started panicking. He said, 'I'll<br />\nsee ya tomorrow'. And he put his<br />\narm around my shoulders, and I<br />\ncried and I cried and I cried. I<br />\ncried for about half an hour,<br />\nman, I got snot all over the front<br />\nof his jacket. I came totally<br />\napart.<br />\nBecause if he would have said<br />\nto me, Johnny, your problem is<br />\nthat nobody ever caressed you,<br />\nyour mother never hugged you,<br />\nthat's all words.

Raindrops stutter<br />\ndown the window, and tile light<br />\n<br />\nfrom outside shines through the<br />\nwindow onto Blake's face,<br />\nmaking it look like he is crying<br />\nhuge tears. Blake puts on the<br />\nFace, compassionate,<br />\nunderstanding yet resigned.

As he<br />\napproaches, he waves the wallet<br />\nand someone in the back of the<br />\nvan pulls down tile curtains. His<br />\nElectra Glide pulls up alongside<br />\nthe van, Blake still yelling and<br />\nwaving the wallet. A sawed-off<br />\nsho tgun appears in the back<br />\nwindow.

CONSIDINE<br />\nYou are walking along a city street. It<br />\nis early morning, and the shops are just<br />\nstarting their day as you stroll by.<br />\nSunlight gazes cooly upon the browning<br />\nleaves of the few, thin trees lining the<br />\nstreet. A bell on a bicycle, chimes, and<br />\nYOU turn to watch the young cyclist pass<br />\nyou.<br />\nYou continue down the street, come to<br />\nthe corner, and turn. And then another<br />\nstreet . It is an older part of the city,<br />\nresidential save for the few small shops<br />\nwhich dot the blocks. You realize you<br />\nhave stumbled into the poorer part of the<br />\ntown, although the cold stone buildings<br />\nand cheaply painted woodwork seem<br />\ngenerally consistent with the rest of the<br />\ncity<br />\n.<br />\nYou continue walking, until you come<br />\nUpon a group of children, playing in an<br />\nalley- way. They are hunched in a circle,<br />\nbarely visible in the shadow of a<br />\nneighboring warehouse. As you approach,<br />\nYou can hear them talking to each other,<br />\nchattering in secretive, high- pitched<br />\nsylables you can't quite make out. You<br />\ncome closer, and can see a small ball, and<br />\nseveral figures scrawled in the sand.<br />\nYou come closer, trying to make out<br />\n'what it is they are playing, but one of<br />\nthem looks up, and they scatter, like<br />\nSquirrels, in a park. You walk over to<br />\n-ok at the figures in<br />\ntheir playground to lo<br />\nthe szinci. only to discover that their<br />\ndeparture has erased all trace of the game<br />\nand its players.<br />\n<br />\nbeautiful daughter felt cheated, because<br />\nthe beauty was all used before they were<br />\nborn; those older than the daughter were<br />\njealous, because they felt the beauty<br />\nshould have gone to them,instead.<br />\nWith nothing left but talent and<br />\nenergy, the other children worked hard to<br />\nattain positions of power and security,<br />\nwhile the beautiful daughter merely<br />\nenjoyed all that came with being<br />\nbeautiful. The result was that th ; other<br />\nchildren became doctors, lawyers ,<br />\npoliticians, scholars; powerful and<br />\nwealthy beyond their wildest dreams. The<br />\npoor , modest parents were overwhelmed<br />\nat their childrens success.<br />\nAs for the daughter, though, she<br />\nbecame addicted to pleasures, and was<br />\nknown as one well-versed in illicit people<br />\nand places, to say nothing of their<br />\npractices. Eventually she was found dead<br />\nin an alley, her debauched body bearing<br />\ntraces of drugs and gross sexual<br />\nindulgence.<br />\nWhen the officer in charge of the case<br />\nwent to see her parents, and break the<br />\nnews, he was shocked that the girl had<br />\nsuch decent, respectable parents and<br />\nhome life. He broke the grisly news<br />\ngently, knowing what a shock it would<br />\nbe. Her parents wept bitterly at the news,<br />\nfor the loss of such great beauty, the<br />\nbeauty which had made her their favorite.<br />\n<br />\nsweeping in a corner of the shop. The<br />\nchild does its best to prevent you from<br />\nseeing its face,but you can still see it. You<br />\nare amazed by the unusual beauty of the<br />\nchild. a sort of handsomness grown from<br />\nthe molding of ugliness into beauty. It<br />\nstrikes you as an almost perverse pleasure,<br />\nbut you cannot help but marvel over the<br />\nchild's appearance.<br />\nYou want to say something, but you<br />\ncannot; even if you could, you are at a<br />\nloss for something to say. The child<br />\ncontinues to avoid your glance. You gaze<br />\nabsently around the shop, until, by<br />\nchance, your gaze meets the child's. You<br />\nsmile, and the child freezes, seemingly<br />\npetrified.<br />\nYou begin to speak, when a voice<br />\nbehind you addresses you. Startled, you<br />\nturn. It is the shopkeeper. You stand<br />\nblankly; the question is repeated. Not<br />\nknowing what has been asked, you<br />\nmeekly point to a small pastry. A price is<br />\nannounced, and you give the shopkeeper<br />\na small coin. The palm remains open, and<br />\nyou place another coin in the<br />\nshopkeepers's hand. You begin to turn, to<br />\nsee if the child is still there, but again you<br />\nare addressed, and you receive your<br />\nchange.<br />\nAs you turn. to leave, you see that the<br />\nchild is no longer there. You leave the<br />\nshop, and as you proceed up the street,<br />\nyou know with certainty that it is under<br />\nthe gaze of the shopkeeper,<br />\n<br />\nSSESSE>S1>SSSESSS<br />\nssssss;SSSSS<br />\n<br />\nSSSSSSSS<br />\n<br />\nA poor couple, new to the land and<br />\nunlearned in its ways, had -.twelve<br />\nchildren. The fourth daughter was<br />\nextremely beautiful, so beautiful in fact<br />\nthat the rest of the children were quite<br />\nugly. You see, this family had only a<br />\ncertain amount of beauty, and all of it<br />\nwas contained in this one child.<br />\nThe other children were always upset<br />\nby this. The ones younger than the<br />\n<br />\nYou enter a small shop. You cannot<br />\nunderstand the writing on the door, but<br />\nyou saw from the window that the shop<br />\nwas a bakery. The door closes behind<br />\nyou, and as it does, a small bell rings. The<br />\nbakery is poorly lit, and smells of fresh<br />\nbreaci. The wooden floor has been<br />\nbleached by what must have been<br />\ncontinuous washings; yet it still appears<br />\ndusty.<br />\nThe shop seems empty when you<br />\nenter, but gradually you notice a small<br />\nchild, about ten or twelve years old,<br />\n<br />\nWith a gallery showing coming up, and<br />\ndesperately short on material, an artist<br />\nonce resorted to painting his inner fears.<br />\nRather than refract his soul through a<br />\nconvenient mythic figure, rather than<br />\ncamoflauge his sins in an abstract<br />\nlandscape, he merely rendered them<br />\nplainly, since his weariness would allow<br />\nno further inspiration.<br />\nLeaving only a few hours, he finished<br />\nthe painting, wrapped it, and dropped it<br />\n<br />\noff at the gallery to be hung. The exhibit<br />\nwould start that evening; he could see it<br />\nthen. It was merely a question of<br />\npriorities, and right now, his main interest<br />\nwas sleep.<br />\nEventually, he awoke, rose, dressed,<br />\nand left for the gallery. He arrived with<br />\nthe show in full progress. Greeting his<br />\nfriends, chatting with the critics, he dealt<br />\nwhth the crowd for almost an hour<br />\nbefore he decided to give a \"guided tour\"<br />\nto his own,inner circle of admirers.<br />\nGoing from painting to painting,<br />\ncommenting wittily, he finally came to<br />\nthe last, that of his inner fears. Instantly,<br />\nhe realized his mistake. He felt suddenly<br />\nexposed, what had happened to his<br />\nclothes? had he forgotten to dress? The<br />\ncrowd behind him began to snicker; he<br />\nturned to face an !array of laughing<br />\nfaces, dinner jackets and evening gowns<br />\ntaking notes on his behavior, he had to<br />\nleave, he turned and grabbed for the<br />\npainting only to be stopped by several<br />\ndozen rough hands mustn't touch mustn't<br />\ntouch but it's mine god 'damn it's mine<br />\nget out of here push shove hey what are<br />\nyou this is my show these are my<br />\npaintings you can't throw me out of here<br />\nstop laughing goddamnit let me back in<br />\nit's my show mypaintipgs damnit lemme<br />\n<br />\nS3SSSSESSSSSS9SSIM<br />\n<br />\nYou have come to the center of the<br />\ncity. The buildings here are large and<br />\nwindowless, the heavy shadows only<br />\nvaguely offset by the pathetic light of a<br />\nfew gaslight street lights. The narrow<br />\nstreets seem, walled in by the heavy<br />\nwarehouses and factories, and you<br />\nwonder where the workers have gone, for<br />\nall you see is buildings.<br />\nYou try to find your way back, but<br />\neven turning and retracing I your steps<br />\nbecomes impossible, for the roads seem<br />\nto close behind you as you pass. Realizing<br />\nthat the streets are no help, you decide to<br />\ntry a door, but all you can find are<br />\ndeadbolt locks and chained gates. You try<br />\nto scale a fence, a wall, but ther are no<br />\ntoeholds, no windows, and all you get is<br />\nscuffed shoes and torn clothes.<br />\nAround a corner, in an obscure<br />\nshadow, you think you see something.<br />\nApproaching slowly, you recognize it as<br />\nan open door. You push it open, and it<br />\nhits. a wall, the dull thud of the<br />\nwood sounding like thunder in the dark<br />\nemptiness. You enter, look around, but in<br />\nthe darkness you can barely see.<br />\nAs your eyes adjust, you can see a dim<br />\nlight glowing above a staircase. You move<br />\ntoward the stairs, cautiously, so as not to<br />\nhit anything in the darkness. As you<br />\nmount the first step, you hear a noise to<br />\nyour right. You turn, and in the darkness<br />\nyou can see two figures.<br />\nIt is the child from the bakery. You<br />\nleave the steps to get a better look at the<br />\nother figure, and you can see' that it is a<br />\nsoldier, fat and unshaven, towering over<br />\nthe child. Suddenly it; occurs to you what<br />\nthey are doing there in the darkness, and<br />\nyou cry out in fear and horror. The<br />\nsoldier looks up; you realize what you've<br />\ndone, and you turn to run, but you trip<br />\nover the stairs, the crash of shoes against<br />\nwood obliterated by the explosion from<br />\nbehind.<br />\nln the agony of a last movement, you<br />\nreach for the stairs, and turn to the two<br />\nfigures in the darkness, the darkness<br />\nflooding your mind with pain and<br />\nnothingness and the laughter of a small<br />\nchild.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letter/october 22,1976<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nSenior Class Film Series<br />\npresents<br />\n(<br />\n\"He's a cross between Rudolph Valentino and<br />\nSteve McQueen.

More<br />\nthan half that money has been directed to offensive weapons<br />\nsystems and nuclear arms, such as the Trident submarine..the<br />\nfleet ballistic missile system, and the Pershing and cruise<br />\nmissiles.<br />\nThe University, while presenting itself as a classic<br />\nhumanistic institution, vigorously supports its APL branch.<br />\nMilitary development in exchange for research opportunities.<br />\nThere are academic spin-offs from these classified activities.<br />\nAnd the Pentagon bucks are needed. A compromise, as<br />\nalways.<br />\nPresident Muller has stated that he'd like to see the APL<br />\ninvolved in more non-military projects, but the limiting<br />\nfactor is the money (not) available when comparek to the<br />\ndollars flowing out of the Pentagon. So the APL helps pile<br />\nmore useless bargaining chips .onto the negotiations table,<br />\nanother few warheads,as University blithely pushes its liberal<br />\nacademic sham of dedication to learning, to arts and sciences:<br />\nall those chalkboard fluffs promoting the betterment of<br />\nmankind.<br />\nHopkins' participation in weapons research through the<br />\n,APL leaves the University with two distinct 'faces, one quite<br />\nugly. That doesn't seem to bother the administration or those<br />\nworking on military projects at the APL -- it's money and a<br />\njob.<br />\nThere are three options available if the.

When the<br />\npaper criticizes UNH, Morrison<br />\nsays, Mills catches flak from<br />\nbackward legislators, alumni, and<br />\nparents of students at UNH. And<br />\nif Mills is jockeying for funds<br />\nfrom a conservative state<br />\ngovernment, he's forced to<br />\nkowtow to outsiders all the more.<br />\nBut students are starting to get<br />\nriled at Mills' continuous<br />\nacquiesence to the Union Leader.<br />\nJoints. _<br />\nThe biggest flap stirring now is<br />\nover an experimental visitation<br />\npolicy scheduled to be enacted in<br />\nsix dormitories.

When the Union<br />\nLeader got wind of this tentative<br />\npolicy, a series of stories and<br />\neditorials were printed<br />\ndenouncing the proposal. And<br />\nwhammo, just like that, Vice<br />\nProvost for Student Affairs,<br />\nRichard Stevens, sent a press<br />\nrelease to the paper stating the<br />\nvisitation policy would be<br />\nshelved.

The services<br />\nprovided encompass two major<br />\ndomains: immediate and tangible<br />\nprograms such as social planning,<br />\nthe SC film series, the food co-op<br />\nand the book exchange; and the<br />\nmore ethereal second category of<br />\nrepresentation of undergraduate<br />\nopinion to both faculty and<br />\nadministration. In both areas the<br />\nStudent Council labors under<br />\nhandicaps.<br />\n<br />\nInnovative social programming<br />\ndepends largely on the collective<br />\nimagination of those in charge of<br />\nplanning events. So, superficially,<br />\nit seems that faulting, \"...Messrs.<br />\nPonchak, Tanenblat, Himmelfarb<br />\nand company...\" as did the<br />\nNews-Letter editorial, might<br />\nprove a valid attack. However,<br />\nconsider a parallel case before<br />\nconcluding that the blame must<br />\nfall to the Council leadership.<br />\nImagine a newspaper<br />\ncontinually written, edited and<br />\nproduced by the same small staff<br />\nof eight or ten people who<br />\npublish under that limitation not<br />\nby choice, but because their<br />\nadvertisements for additional<br />\nhelp go unnoticed and no other<br />\nwould-be journalists involve<br />\nthemselves in their publishing<br />\nprocess. After awhile, wouldn't<br />\nthe writing styles, editorial<br />\n<br />\npositions and layouts become all<br />\ntoo familiar and stale to the<br />\npaper's audience?<br />\nSo might the social events<br />\nplanned by a small group of<br />\nCouncil members become<br />\nrepetitious\u2014not be design, but<br />\nbecause fresh ideas are hard to<br />\ncome by without the<br />\ninvolvement of new individuals.<br />\nAs the newspaper's solicitation of<br />\naid goes unnoticed by an<br />\ninvolvement-blind readership, the<br />\nSC cries for help go unheard and<br />\nunanswered by an increasingly<br />\ndeaf and mute student body.<br />\nOperating within this<br />\nlimitation, the services offered by<br />\nthe Council in the social realm<br />\nincluding the co-op and<br />\nexchange) have been at least<br />\nmOderately successful.

Now, mind you ., 2 years<br />\nago I wouldn't have said the same<br />\nthing; nay I quite clearly said the<br />\nopposite. But now as an old and<br />\nsagacious senior, I propose that<br />\nJohns Hopkins is a great place.<br />\nWhen I was a freshman, I<br />\ndidn't know what was going on<br />\n(not that I necessarily do now)<br />\nand simply lived from day to<br />\nday, getting by\u2014but just barely (I<br />\nwas too naive to realize that one<br />\nwas not supposed to take courses<br />\nwhere 10 papers were required in<br />\none semester\u2014I didn't even know<br />\nwhat a gut was). Academically, I<br />\ndidn't do very, well, but boy did<br />\nwe have fun that year!\u2014Shaving<br />\ncream fights, games of \"Hearts\"<br />\nuntil 5 a.m., straight Tequila<br />\n(forget about the salt and the<br />\nlemon, by God, I'm tough, I can<br />\ntake it!), studying (?) for finals<br />\nto Christmas Carols, and being<br />\ndragged to my first pornographic<br />\nmovie and having to sit in the<br />\n2nd row of Shriver Auditorium<br />\n(so I couldn't get up and leave<br />\nwithout causing hysterical<br />\nlaughter throughout the room).<br />\nThe list goes on forever. But<br />\nwhen it comes down to what I<br />\ngot out of freshman year, good<br />\nfines and good friends are about<br />\nit. I'll be damned if I can<br />\nremember anything I learned that<br />\nyear (except how to write papers,<br />\nthat is).<br />\n<br />\nBy sophomore year, the fun<br />\n\"nerd\" and studying on a Friday<br />\nhad gone and I still couldn't deal<br />\nnight if that's what you want to<br />\nwith the academics. I just wasn't<br />\ndo? I have been lucky in that I've<br />\nthat interested in what I was<br />\nhad the privelege to have 3<br />\nlearning, and got more and more<br />\nclasses where the professors were<br />\ndiscouraged with my<br />\ndownright inspirational. Hopkins<br />\ncontemporaries who seemed to<br />\nis filled with people who know<br />\nbe getting \"ahead\" by cheating<br />\ntheir stuff, and are only too glad<br />\nand speeding to get their work<br />\nto share their knowledge with<br />\ndone.<br />\nstudents (not just grad students,<br />\nThanks to a very kind and<br />\neither). What surprised me even<br />\nhelpful Dr. Dierman (yes, folks, I<br />\nmore is that often they enjoy<br />\nknow what I just said, and I<br />\ntalking to students(there are one<br />\nstand by it!) I was able to take<br />\nor two things we can teach them<br />\noff second semester and get<br />\ntc,o). What I'm trying to say is<br />\naway. That's when my change in<br />\nthat Hopkins is what each<br />\nattitude came about.

For those of us who<br />\nto become submerged within a<br />\nsystem of prevailing attitudes learned it later, it's still<br />\nthat were neither realistic, nor, worthwhile knowledge. I'm not<br />\nsaying that the Hop isn't without<br />\nmore importantly,'my own. With<br />\nits shortcomings\u2014what<br />\nthis knowledge, my dear reader, I<br />\ninstitution (or person for that<br />\nbegan to realize just what a<br />\nmatter)isn't? Basically, I propose<br />\nwonderful and fascinating place<br />\nthat if you are somone who is<br />\nJohns Hopkins is.

For example,<br />\nstudents study the physical<br />\nfeatures of Spruce Knob<br />\nMountain not only for their own<br />\ngood, but also in preparation for<br />\nteaching younger students about<br />\nthe mountain.<br />\nAs a part of the Spring Term,<br />\ncollege students serve as<br />\napprentices to staff members<br />\nduring a number of three to<br />\nseven-day programs for primary<br />\nand secondary schools. Many<br />\nschools from the East either send<br />\nstudents to West Virginia or<br />\nWoodlands conies to the schools,<br />\nfor a short course dealing with<br />\nthe outdoors. Last year, a<br />\nMaryland school sent<br />\nsixth -graders canoeing down the<br />\nPotomac in a cours.F designed to<br />\nillustrate the whole of American.<br />\nhistory, from Paleozoic times to<br />\nWatergate.<br />\nTo enhance the learning<br />\nprocess, the Woodlands staff and<br />\nstudents live together as a<br />\ncommunity. A comparison of<br />\ncomparison of this way of life<br />\n(by a co-operative effort,<br /><br />\nconsensus style) with more<br />\nfamiliar lifestyles is helpful for<br />\nthose evaluating their own<br />\npersonal values and priorities.<br />\nThe operation of the community<br />\nalso provides students with a<br />\nunique opportunity to learn new<br />\nskills. Each student and staff<br />\nmember has responsibilities<br />\nranging from cooking to<br />\ncarpentry and dishwashing to<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nAs one may surmise,<br />\nWoodlands believes strongly in<br />\nthe benefits of combining<br />\nphysical and mental labor.

I started in a thing<br />\ncalled Our Gang. I was Mickey.<br />\nWith my kids I found the<br />\nsecret is to not teach 'em but to<br />\nlearn from 'em. They're born<br />\nwith everything. And what most<br />\npeople do is squash it and take it<br />\naway from them. If you can just<br />\nlay back and trust whatever God<br />\nthere is in this universe that made<br />\nthem kids, made 'em to work<br />\nthat someplace there's more good<br />\nin us than bad or we'da never<br />\nmade it outta the trees in the<br />\nfirst place, we woulda killed each<br />\nother in the caves.

The<br />\ncamera pulls back to a full shot<br />\nof Robert Blake, in his<br />\nunderwear, doing chin-ups on a<br />\nbar wedged in a doorway. He<br />\ndrops off the bar, and moves to<br />\nthe kitchen. While lifting<br />\narm-weights, Blake cracks an egg<br />\ninto a glass, then drinks it. He<br />\nhits the floor and begins doing<br />\npush-ups, slowly pumping up and<br />\ndoWn. He dons a cop uniform,<br />\nthen goes outside and mounts his<br />\nElectra Glide police motorcycle.<br />\nHe roars away, spitting up dust<br />\nand gravel as he disappears down<br />\nthe long Arizona highway.<br />\nAn' about my father? He was<br />\npretty sick in the head. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, if he hadn'ta had<br />\nhis empire around him, my<br />\nmother and three kids, he would've<br />\nended up in the loony bin. But<br />\nhe had the kind of insanity that<br />\nonly in my later years I've come<br />\nto understand: It was one of the<br />\ngood things I got. He was a<br />\nmonster. He beat the shit out of<br />\nme from the day I was born, and<br />\nmy brother, my sister.<br />\nIn a scene from \"Baretta\",<br />\nBlake hustles out into the street<br />\nto apologize to a young woman<br />\nreporter who has been covering<br />\nan important homicide case, and<br />\nknows more about it than<br />\nBaretta knows.

Minutes<br />\npass. \"Yeah\", he says. Then he<br />\ngets up and leaves, walking<br />\nslowly, careful not to disturb the<br />\njanitor's solitude.<br /><br />\nI went into therapy. And the<br />\nthing I learned is this; I am what<br />\nI am. I'm crazy, I'm hostile, I got<br />\na lot of drive, I got a lot of hate,<br />\na lot of fear.

Too big for the world. Anri<br /><br />\nthat the world was not at fault,<br />\njust one of those things.

One day he got up when I<br />\nleft and walked out of his office<br />\nonto this little dirt area. Said, 'I'll<br />\nsee ya tomorrow.' It was the first<br /><br />\ntime he ever walked me out. And<br />\nI started panicking. He said, 'I'll<br />\nsee ya tomorrow'. And he put his<br />\narm around my shoulders, and I<br />\ncried and I cried and I cried. I<br />\ncried for about half an hour,<br />\nman, I got snot all over the front<br />\nof his jacket. I came totally<br />\napart.<br />\nBecause if he would have said<br />\nto me, Johnny, your problem is<br />\nthat nobody ever caressed you,<br />\nyour mother never hugged you,<br />\nthat's all words.

Picking it up, Blake<br />\nfinds money and some cards-so<br />\nhe sets off after the van, now<br />\nmiles ahead of him. As he<br />\napproaches, he waves the wallet<br />\nand someone in the back of the<br />\nvan pulls down tile curtains. His<br />\nElectra Glide pulls up alongside<br />\nthe van, Blake still yelling and<br />\nwaving the wallet. A sawed-off<br />\nsho tgun appears in the back<br />\nwindow. As he drifts back behind<br />\nthe van, he sees the gun just as it<br />\ngoes off In slow motion, blood<br />\nspurt's from his chest, and he<br />\npitches slowly forward onto the<br />\nfront of the bike. For..several<br />\nseconds the camera watches the<br />\nmotorcycle and its lifeless<br />\npassenger.

CONSIDINE<br />\nYou are walking along a city street. It<br />\nis early morning, and the shops are just<br />\nstarting their day as you stroll by.<br />\nSunlight gazes cooly upon the browning<br />\nleaves of the few, thin trees lining the<br />\nstreet. A bell on a bicycle, chimes, and<br />\nYOU turn to watch the young cyclist pass<br />\nyou.<br />\nYou continue down the street, come to<br />\nthe corner, and turn. And then another<br />\nstreet . It is an older part of the city,<br />\nresidential save for the few small shops<br />\nwhich dot the blocks. You realize you<br />\nhave stumbled into the poorer part of the<br />\ntown, although the cold stone buildings<br />\nand cheaply painted woodwork seem<br />\ngenerally consistent with the rest of the<br />\ncity<br />\n.<br />\nYou continue walking, until you come<br />\nUpon a group of children, playing in an<br />\nalley- way. They are hunched in a circle,<br />\nbarely visible in the shadow of a<br />\nneighboring warehouse. As you approach,<br />\nYou can hear them talking to each other,<br />\nchattering in secretive, high- pitched<br />\nsylables you can't quite make out. You<br />\ncome closer, and can see a small ball, and<br />\nseveral figures scrawled in the sand.<br />\nYou come closer, trying to make out<br />\n'what it is they are playing, but one of<br />\nthem looks up, and they scatter, like<br />\nSquirrels, in a park. You walk over to<br />\n-ok at the figures in<br />\ntheir playground to lo<br />\nthe szinci. only to discover that their<br />\ndeparture has erased all trace of the game<br />\nand its players.<br /><br />\nbeautiful daughter felt cheated, because<br />\nthe beauty was all used before they were<br />\nborn; those older than the daughter were<br />\njealous, because they felt the beauty<br />\nshould have gone to them,instead.<br />\nWith nothing left but talent and<br />\nenergy, the other children worked hard to<br />\nattain positions of power and security,<br />\nwhile the beautiful daughter merely<br />\nenjoyed all that came with being<br />\nbeautiful. The result was that th ; other<br />\nchildren became doctors, lawyers ,<br />\npoliticians, scholars; powerful and<br />\nwealthy beyond their wildest dreams. The<br />\npoor , modest parents were overwhelmed<br />\nat their childrens success.<br />\nAs for the daughter, though, she<br />\nbecame addicted to pleasures, and was<br />\nknown as one well-versed in illicit people<br />\nand places, to say nothing of their<br />\npractices. Eventually she was found dead<br />\nin an alley, her debauched body bearing<br />\ntraces of drugs and gross sexual<br />\nindulgence.<br />\nWhen the officer in charge of the case<br />\nwent to see her parents, and break the<br />\nnews, he was shocked that the girl had<br />\nsuch decent, respectable parents and<br />\nhome life. He broke the grisly news<br />\ngently, knowing what a shock it would<br />\nbe. Her parents wept bitterly at the news,<br />\nfor the loss of such great beauty, the<br />\nbeauty which had made her their favorite.<br /><br />\nsweeping in a corner of the shop. The<br />\nchild does its best to prevent you from<br />\nseeing its face,but you can still see it. You<br />\nare amazed by the unusual beauty of the<br />\nchild. a sort of handsomness grown from<br />\nthe molding of ugliness into beauty. It<br />\nstrikes you as an almost perverse pleasure,<br />\nbut you cannot help but marvel over the<br />\nchild's appearance.<br />\nYou want to say something, but you<br />\ncannot; even if you could, you are at a<br />\nloss for something to say. The child<br />\ncontinues to avoid your glance. You gaze<br />\nabsently around the shop, until, by<br />\nchance, your gaze meets the child's. You<br />\nsmile, and the child freezes, seemingly<br />\npetrified.<br />\nYou begin to speak, when a voice<br />\nbehind you addresses you. Startled, you<br />\nturn. It is the shopkeeper. You stand<br />\nblankly; the question is repeated. Not<br />\nknowing what has been asked, you<br />\nmeekly point to a small pastry. A price is<br />\nannounced, and you give the shopkeeper<br />\na small coin. The palm remains open, and<br />\nyou place another coin in the<br />\nshopkeepers's hand. You begin to turn, to<br />\nsee if the child is still there, but again you<br />\nare addressed, and you receive your<br />\nchange.<br />\nAs you turn. to leave, you see that the<br />\nchild is no longer there. You leave the<br />\nshop, and as you proceed up the street,<br />\nyou know with certainty that it is under<br />\nthe gaze of the shopkeeper,<br /><br />\nSSESSE&gt;S1&gt;SSSESSS<br />\nssssss;SSSSS<br /><br />\nSSSSSSSS<br /><br />\nA poor couple, new to the land and<br />\nunlearned in its ways, had -.twelve<br />\nchildren. The fourth daughter was<br />\nextremely beautiful, so beautiful in fact<br />\nthat the rest of the children were quite<br />\nugly. You see, this family had only a<br />\ncertain amount of beauty, and all of it<br />\nwas contained in this one child.<br />\nThe other children were always upset<br />\nby this. The ones younger than the<br /><br />\nYou enter a small shop. You cannot<br />\nunderstand the writing on the door, but<br />\nyou saw from the window that the shop<br />\nwas a bakery. The door closes behind<br />\nyou, and as it does, a small bell rings. The<br />\nbakery is poorly lit, and smells of fresh<br />\nbreaci. The wooden floor has been<br />\nbleached by what must have been<br />\ncontinuous washings; yet it still appears<br />\ndusty.<br />\nThe shop seems empty when you<br />\nenter, but gradually you notice a small<br />\nchild, about ten or twelve years old,<br /><br />\nWith a gallery showing coming up, and<br />\ndesperately short on material, an artist<br />\nonce resorted to painting his inner fears.<br />\nRather than refract his soul through a<br />\nconvenient mythic figure, rather than<br />\ncamoflauge his sins in an abstract<br />\nlandscape, he merely rendered them<br />\nplainly, since his weariness would allow<br />\nno further inspiration.<br />\nLeaving only a few hours, he finished<br />\nthe painting, wrapped it, and dropped it<br /><br />\noff at the gallery to be hung. The exhibit<br />\nwould start that evening; he could see it<br />\nthen. It was merely a question of<br />\npriorities, and right now, his main interest<br />\nwas sleep.<br />\nEventually, he awoke, rose, dressed,<br />\nand left for the gallery. He arrived with<br />\nthe show in full progress. Greeting his<br />\nfriends, chatting with the critics, he dealt<br />\nwhth the crowd for almost an hour<br />\nbefore he decided to give a \"guided tour\"<br />\nto his own,inner circle of admirers.<br />\nGoing from painting to painting,<br />\ncommenting wittily, he finally came to<br />\nthe last, that of his inner fears. Instantly,<br />\nhe realized his mistake. He felt suddenly<br />\nexposed, what had happened to his<br />\nclothes? had he forgotten to dress? The<br />\ncrowd behind him began to snicker; he<br />\nturned to face an !array of laughing<br />\nfaces, dinner jackets and evening gowns<br />\ntaking notes on his behavior, he had to<br />\nleave, he turned and grabbed for the<br />\npainting only to be stopped by several<br />\ndozen rough hands mustn't touch mustn't<br />\ntouch but it's mine god 'damn it's mine<br />\nget out of here push shove hey what are<br />\nyou this is my show these are my<br />\npaintings you can't throw me out of here<br />\nstop laughing goddamnit let me back in<br />\nit's my show mypaintipgs damnit lemme<br /><br />\nS3SSSSESSSSSS9SSIM<br /><br />\nYou have come to the center of the<br />\ncity. The buildings here are large and<br />\nwindowless, the heavy shadows only<br />\nvaguely offset by the pathetic light of a<br />\nfew gaslight street lights. The narrow<br />\nstreets seem, walled in by the heavy<br />\nwarehouses and factories, and you<br />\nwonder where the workers have gone, for<br />\nall you see is buildings.<br />\nYou try to find your way back, but<br />\neven turning and retracing I your steps<br />\nbecomes impossible, for the roads seem<br />\nto close behind you as you pass. Realizing<br />\nthat the streets are no help, you decide to<br />\ntry a door, but all you can find are<br />\ndeadbolt locks and chained gates. You try<br />\nto scale a fence, a wall, but ther are no<br />\ntoeholds, no windows, and all you get is<br />\nscuffed shoes and torn clothes.<br />\nAround a corner, in an obscure<br />\nshadow, you think you see something.<br />\nApproaching slowly, you recognize it as<br />\nan open door. You push it open, and it<br />\nhits. a wall, the dull thud of the<br />\nwood sounding like thunder in the dark<br />\nemptiness. You enter, look around, but in<br />\nthe darkness you can barely see.<br />\nAs your eyes adjust, you can see a dim<br />\nlight glowing above a staircase. You move<br />\ntoward the stairs, cautiously, so as not to<br />\nhit anything in the darkness. As you<br />\nmount the first step, you hear a noise to<br />\nyour right. You turn, and in the darkness<br />\nyou can see two figures.<br />\nIt is the child from the bakery. You<br />\nleave the steps to get a better look at the<br />\nother figure, and you can see' that it is a<br />\nsoldier, fat and unshaven, towering over<br />\nthe child. Suddenly it; occurs to you what<br />\nthey are doing there in the darkness, and<br />\nyou cry out in fear and horror. The<br />\nsoldier looks up; you realize what you've<br />\ndone, and you turn to run, but you trip<br />\nover the stairs, the crash of shoes against<br />\nwood obliterated by the explosion from<br />\nbehind.<br />\nln the agony of a last movement, you<br />\nreach for the stairs, and turn to the two<br />\nfigures in the darkness, the darkness<br />\nflooding your mind with pain and<br />\nnothingness and the laughter of a small<br />\nchild.<br /><br />\npage 6/news-letter/october 22,1976<br />\n*<br /><br />\nSenior Class Film Series<br />\npresents<br />\n(<br />\n\"He's a cross between Rudolph Valentino and<br />\nSteve McQueen.

More<br />\nthan half that money has been directed to offensive weapons<br />\nsystems and nuclear arms, such as the Trident submarine..the<br />\nfleet ballistic missile system, and the Pershing and cruise<br />\nmissiles.<br />\nThe University, while presenting itself as a classic<br />\nhumanistic institution, vigorously supports its APL branch.<br />\nMilitary development in exchange for research opportunities.<br />\nThere are academic spin-offs from these classified activities.<br />\nAnd the Pentagon bucks are needed. A compromise, as<br />\nalways.<br />\nPresident Muller has stated that he'd like to see the APL<br />\ninvolved in more non-military projects, but the limiting<br />\nfactor is the money (not) available when comparek to the<br />\ndollars flowing out of the Pentagon. So the APL helps pile<br />\nmore useless bargaining chips .onto the negotiations table,<br />\nanother few warheads,as University blithely pushes its liberal<br />\nacademic sham of dedication to learning, to arts and sciences:<br />\nall those chalkboard fluffs promoting the betterment of<br />\nmankind.<br />\nHopkins' participation in weapons research through the<br />\n,APL leaves the University with two distinct 'faces, one quite<br />\nugly. That doesn't seem to bother the administration or those<br />\nworking on military projects at the APL -- it's money and a<br />\njob.<br />\nThere are three options available if the. University would<br />\nwake up from its cynicism and pretension. Hopkins could<br />\nsever all ties with APL, relieving the University of its<br />\nresponsibility for the weapons program, while the laboratory<br />\ndoes its work under the aegis of some other institution. Or it<br />\ncould refuse any involvement with the Pentagon, thus cutting<br />\noff about 80% of its 'funds, along with the specific APL<br />\ncontributions to defense development. (Lose the military,<br />\nlose a lot of jobs.) Finally, Hopkins might selectively decline<br />\nresearch for certain systems (like the Trident), again throwing<br />\nsome engineers into the job-search line.<br />\nAs the University has planted itself into a farce, it must<br />\nmake some major sacrifices to get out. Hopkins should<br />\nseriously look back to sOme of last year's centennial<br />\nplatitudes, and openly reconsider its relationship with the<br /><br />\nAnother choice<br /><br />\nMarijuana: It's time for a change<br />\nBy D.W. DESMITH<br />\nIn an age of perpetual murder,<br />\nrape and kidnapping, our nation's<br />\ncurrent laws concerning the use<br />\nof marijuana are at best,<br />\nanachronistic, and at worst, an<br />\ninvasion of the basic human right<br />\nto freedom. Crimes which cause<br />\nmore human suffering than pot.<br />\nsmoking ever could, are going<br />\nunsolved while the U.S. Drug<br />\nEnforcement Agency spends<br />\nmillions of dollars busting ,<br />\nsmall-time pot smokers.<br />\nThe main argument against<br />\nthe decriminalization or<br />\nlegalization of pot just doesn't<br />\nhold water anymore. It could<br />\nonce be argued that pot leads to<br />\nharder drugs. Today pot is not<br />\nresticted to the derelicts of<br />\nsociety? thirty million people in<br />\nthe U'S' alone have tried,<br />\nmarijuana, a third of them being<br />\nregular users. It is the perpersecution which pot users<br />\nsuffer that causes them to flee to<br />\nharder drugs. If grass was legal<br />\nmany young people would never<br />\nbe pressured into trying<br />\ndangerous drugs. Thankfully,<br />\nmany of our legislators, doctors,<br />\neducators, and psychiatrists are<br />\nbeginning to challenge outdated<br />\nmarijuana laws with relative<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nCurrent Federal law rewards<br />\nthe basic possessor of pot with a<br />\nfive thousand dollar fine and/or a<br />\none year jail sentence. In eight<br />\nstates, marijuana smokers are not<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\narrested at all. Oregon, Alaska,<br />\nThe director of NORML,<br />\nMaine, Colorado, California, Keith Stroup, said that in 1975<br />\nthere were 416,000 arrests for<br />\nOhio. South Dakota, and<br />\nmarijuana, 70% of all<br />\nMinnesota, make the possession<br />\ndrug-related arrests. The cost to<br />\nof pot for personal use a<br />\nthe tax amounted to over $600<br />\nmisdemeanor- an offense as<br />\nserious as a traffic ticket. More .million, and that cost is not<br />\nlikely to drop in the future.<br />\nchanges are on the way.

When the<br />\npaper criticizes UNH, Morrison<br />\nsays, Mills catches flak from<br />\nbackward legislators, alumni, and<br />\nparents of students at UNH. And<br />\nif Mills is jockeying for funds<br />\nfrom a conservative state<br />\ngovernment, he's forced to<br />\nkowtow to outsiders all the more.<br />\nBut students are starting to get<br />\nriled at Mills' continuous<br />\nacquiesence to the Union Leader.<br />\nJoints. _<br />\nThe biggest flap stirring now is<br />\nover an experimental visitation<br />\npolicy scheduled to be enacted in<br />\nsix dormitories. The plan was.<br />\njointly conceived and agreed on<br />\nby a combination of student<br />\nleaders and administrators,<br />\nincluding Mills. When the Union<br />\nLeader got wind of this tentative<br />\npolicy, a series of stories and<br />\neditorials were printed<br />\ndenouncing the proposal. And<br />\nwhammo, just like that, Vice<br />\nProvost for Student Affairs,<br />\nRichard Stevens, sent a press<br />\nrelease to the paper stating the<br />\nvisitation policy would be<br />\nshelved. The release was written<br />\nwithout first permitting students<br />\nto defend their position and<br />\nprotest to the Board of Trustees.<br />\nPhotos<br />\nAnother example of Loeb's<br />\niron hand over University affairs<br />\nwas when the New Hampshire<br />\nprinted a photo of two streakers<br />\nat a campus revel. President Mills<br />\npromptly sent an open letter to<br />\nthe Union Leader condemning<br />\nthe action, presumably to<br />\nforestall an editorial comment.<br />\nEven though the New<br />\nHampshire's office is just a few<br />\ndoors away, Mills refused to talk<br />\nto the editors before apoligizing<br />\nto Loeb and his henchmen. The<br />\nUnion Leader ran an explosive<br />\neditorial despite Mills' letter.<br />\nStudents are just about fed up<br />\nwith what they call \"an apalling<br />\nsituation.\" Farnham, who was<br />\nelected last year on a platform<br />\nbased on \"working within the<br />\nsystem,\" has set his eyeg on more<br />\nissues to fight about, mainly the<br />\npass!fail predicament, tuition<br />\nincreases, the growing number of<br />\nadministrators on campus, and<br />\n\"an unruly registration procedure<br />\nthat everyone thinks is lousy<br />\nexcept the registrar.\"<br />\nAllies<br />\nOne thing the ongoing<br />\ncontroversy has accomplished is<br />\nthe unity of two disparate forces;<br />\nthe student government and the<br />\nNew Hampshire, an alliance that<br />\nis rare on most campuses today.<br />\nBut then both organizations<br />\nfigure that UNH has some<br />\ncatching up to do, and William<br />\nLoeb, that swashbuckler of the<br />\npress, doesn't scare them one bit.<br /><br />\npage 10/news-lettedoctober 22,1976<br /><br />\nCLIP AD AND BRING IN FOR FREE SODA<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br /><br />\n---<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nBARNSTORMERS 76<br /><br />\n....+......,...^.......--__<br /><br />\n.....,_,,,<br />\n,<br />\n.<br />\n1<br />\n:<br />\n'`-;;;,\u2022 .\"<br />\n\"<br />\n..,.<br />\n4.\u201e.....:,--,: se<br />\np.c7;c_'`'..--<br /><br />\npresents<br /><br />\n__<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2014.<br /><br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\n_,...,..<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\n,<br />\n,- \u2014....,,,.<br /><br />\nT *, 0,...ge<br />\n.... e.<br />\n- ,,,,...\".,,,,,L,41,..... .v ._,.\u2022K\u2018,......(,5:7--...wv..,\u201e __L\u201e<br />\n.

The services<br />\nprovided encompass two major<br />\ndomains: immediate and tangible<br />\nprograms such as social planning,<br />\nthe SC film series, the food co-op<br />\nand the book exchange; and the<br />\nmore ethereal second category of<br />\nrepresentation of undergraduate<br />\nopinion to both faculty and<br />\nadministration. In both areas the<br />\nStudent Council labors under<br />\nhandicaps.<br /><br />\nInnovative social programming<br />\ndepends largely on the collective<br />\nimagination of those in charge of<br />\nplanning events. So, superficially,<br />\nit seems that faulting, \"...Messrs.<br />\nPonchak, Tanenblat, Himmelfarb<br />\nand company...\" as did the<br />\nNews-Letter editorial, might<br />\nprove a valid attack. However,<br />\nconsider a parallel case before<br />\nconcluding that the blame must<br />\nfall to the Council leadership.<br />\nImagine a newspaper<br />\ncontinually written, edited and<br />\nproduced by the same small staff<br />\nof eight or ten people who<br />\npublish under that limitation not<br />\nby choice, but because their<br />\nadvertisements for additional<br />\nhelp go unnoticed and no other<br />\nwould-be journalists involve<br />\nthemselves in their publishing<br />\nprocess. After awhile, wouldn't<br />\nthe writing styles, editorial<br /><br />\npositions and layouts become all<br />\ntoo familiar and stale to the<br />\npaper's audience?<br />\nSo might the social events<br />\nplanned by a small group of<br />\nCouncil members become<br />\nrepetitious\u2014not be design, but<br />\nbecause fresh ideas are hard to<br />\ncome by without the<br />\ninvolvement of new individuals.<br />\nAs the newspaper's solicitation of<br />\naid goes unnoticed by an<br />\ninvolvement-blind readership, the<br />\nSC cries for help go unheard and<br />\nunanswered by an increasingly<br />\ndeaf and mute student body.<br />\nOperating within this<br />\nlimitation, the services offered by<br />\nthe Council in the social realm<br />\nincluding the co-op and<br />\nexchange) have been at least<br />\nmOderately successful. I include<br />\nin these services such events as<br />\nOrientation, the Spring Fair and<br /><br />\nthe MSE symposium, all three of the NAACP or complaints about<br />\nwhich are organized under the vandalism) go unanswered. Why<br />\nauspices of the Council. The then, should the Council be<br />\nreason for the success of these censured when its demands are<br />\nservices is that they are largely or not considered?<br />\nwholely planned and executed by<br />\nPlight<br />\nstudents for students with advice<br />\nand cooperation requested of<br />\nThe plight of the Student<br />\nadministration and faculty.<br />\nCouncil is also that of my<br />\nReport<br />\nn o t -so-hypothetical newspaper.<br />\nIn marked contrast to these Yet, no one advises the-paper to<br />\n\"success stories\" stand such limit its - publishing to news<br />\nCouncil endeavors as the stories and features to the neglect<br />\ninitiation of the findings of the of editorializing.

Now, mind you ., 2 years<br />\nago I wouldn't have said the same<br />\nthing; nay I quite clearly said the<br />\nopposite. But now as an old and<br />\nsagacious senior, I propose that<br />\nJohns Hopkins is a great place.<br />\nWhen I was a freshman, I<br />\ndidn't know what was going on<br />\n(not that I necessarily do now)<br />\nand simply lived from day to<br />\nday, getting by\u2014but just barely (I<br />\nwas too naive to realize that one<br />\nwas not supposed to take courses<br />\nwhere 10 papers were required in<br />\none semester\u2014I didn't even know<br />\nwhat a gut was). Academically, I<br />\ndidn't do very, well, but boy did<br />\nwe have fun that year!\u2014Shaving<br />\ncream fights, games of \"Hearts\"<br />\nuntil 5 a.m., straight Tequila<br />\n(forget about the salt and the<br />\nlemon, by God, I'm tough, I can<br />\ntake it!), studying (?) for finals<br />\nto Christmas Carols, and being<br />\ndragged to my first pornographic<br />\nmovie and having to sit in the<br />\n2nd row of Shriver Auditorium<br />\n(so I couldn't get up and leave<br />\nwithout causing hysterical<br />\nlaughter throughout the room).<br />\nThe list goes on forever. But<br />\nwhen it comes down to what I<br />\ngot out of freshman year, good<br />\nfines and good friends are about<br />\nit. I'll be damned if I can<br />\nremember anything I learned that<br />\nyear (except how to write papers,<br />\nthat is).<br /><br />\nBy sophomore year, the fun<br />\n\"nerd\" and studying on a Friday<br />\nhad gone and I still couldn't deal<br />\nnight if that's what you want to<br />\nwith the academics. I just wasn't<br />\ndo? I have been lucky in that I've<br />\nthat interested in what I was<br />\nhad the privelege to have 3<br />\nlearning, and got more and more<br />\nclasses where the professors were<br />\ndiscouraged with my<br />\ndownright inspirational. Hopkins<br />\ncontemporaries who seemed to<br />\nis filled with people who know<br />\nbe getting \"ahead\" by cheating<br />\ntheir stuff, and are only too glad<br />\nand speeding to get their work<br />\nto share their knowledge with<br />\ndone.<br />\nstudents (not just grad students,<br />\nThanks to a very kind and<br />\neither). What surprised me even<br />\nhelpful Dr. Dierman (yes, folks, I<br />\nmore is that often they enjoy<br />\nknow what I just said, and I<br />\ntalking to students(there are one<br />\nstand by it!) I was able to take<br />\nor two things we can teach them<br />\noff second semester and get<br />\ntc,o). What I'm trying to say is<br />\naway. That's when my change in<br />\nthat Hopkins is what each<br />\nattitude came about. The world<br />\nindividual makes it to be, and its<br />\ndoes not stop at Charles and 34th<br />\npotential for each one of us is<br />\nStreets (revelation of without bounds.

For those of us who<br />\nto become submerged within a<br />\nsystem of prevailing attitudes learned it later, it's still<br />\nthat were neither realistic, nor, worthwhile knowledge. I'm not<br />\nsaying that the Hop isn't without<br />\nmore importantly,'my own. With<br />\nits shortcomings\u2014what<br />\nthis knowledge, my dear reader, I<br />\ninstitution (or person for that<br />\nbegan to realize just what a<br />\nmatter)isn't? Basically, I propose<br />\nwonderful and fascinating place<br />\nthat if you are somone who is<br />\nJohns Hopkins is.
