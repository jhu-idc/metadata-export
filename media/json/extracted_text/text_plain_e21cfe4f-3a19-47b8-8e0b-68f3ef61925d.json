Accordingly, the brick<br />\nbarn situated near the southerly entrance to the campus was renovated to meet the situation.<br />\nTradition clothes our homely Barn with dearest memories.<br />\nEspecially has its Trophy Room and surrounding offices become,<br />\nto a great extent, the heart of the campus.<br />\nBut as we watch and listen to the pulsating of that heart today, we fail to find anything endearing or beautiful about it\u2014at<br />\nleast between the hours of ten and four. What was once a Trophy<br />\nRoom has become a bums' hang-out.<br />\nTo be sure, the Barn should be a place for refreshment and<br />\npleasure. Card games in themselves are perfectly harmless. But<br />\nwhen those same games give rise to a constant stream of curses<br />\nand continual arguments between the players, we fail to, find<br />\nanything salutary about them. The card players constitute a<br />\ngroup of students who, for the most part, make themselves extremely obnoxious by their blatant clamor, their continual brawling, their utter disregard for property, public and personal, and<br />\ntheir lack of cleanliness.<br />\nWe do not pretend to be \"uplifts\" or \"clean-ups,\" but we do<br />\nsuggest that the offenders either mend their ways or get out. If<br />\nno improvement is noticed, it would be well for the Student Council to exercise its prerogative as custodian of the Trophy Room.<br />\n<br />\nIT CAN'T BE LONG NOW<br />\nThe elimination of English Composition I from the curriculum of the College of Arts and Sciences is just another .milestone in the inauguration of the New Plan. \"English Comp.\"<br />\nfollows in the footsteps of elementary language courses, which<br />\nwere stricken from the list of available subjects last year.<br />\nNot only, however, have English Composition and English<br />\nLiterature I been dropped, but, as Dean Ames recently explained,<br />\nthe entire range of courses open to A. B. candidates has been<br />\nmaterially shortened. According to the Dean's statement in the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER last month, \"these courses are arranged so as to<br />\ngive a well-rounded general education or to prepare for admission to the study of medicine, law, etc.\" With such a narrow<br />\nchoice before them, however, we doubt very much whether many<br />\nstudents will desire to enter the College on that basis. Most young<br />\nmen wanting the sort of \"general education\" to which the Dean<br />\nrefers will want a larger choice than the revised catalogue will<br />\noffer, and, consequently, instead of not entering the undergraduate school specifically because they are told that they may not,<br />\nthey will desist from doing so voluntarily.<br />\nFor all practical purposes, it would seem; then, that the New<br />\nPlan is in actual operation. It is very difficult to predict how many<br />\nmen will enter under the New Plan next fall, but it does not take a<br />\ngenius to see that the number entering the old system will be<br />\ngreatly decreased.<br />\n<br />\n\"YES and NO\"<br />\nIf you allow the truth of a statement made by a professor<br />\nEnglish,<br />\nto the effect that 'students occasionally read assigned<br />\nof<br />\nliterature, but seldom to more purpose than a feeling of defense<br />\nagainst a possible quiz question, it will be more remarkable that<br />\nmagazines play so small.a part in undergraduate life. To be sure,<br />\na junior recently told me that he hadn't time for such drivel as<br />\n\"Cyrano de Bergerac\" because. the Cosmopolitan was running<br />\na story of Adela Rogers St. John's, but I refer rather to magazines cOntaining something better than yarns of contemporary and<br />\npeculiarly insane college life.<br />\nCertainly the average college student has a keen eye for<br />\nsmut, or, if you are offended by the word, at least for the slightly<br />\nerotic, in literature. No, not \"Artists and Models\"; that is seldom read and never bought;\u2014one turns its gaudy pages eagerly<br />\nwhile drinking a Coca-Cola--nor any of its artistic ilk. But there<br />\nare two magazines, \"Beau\", and \"The Two Worlds Monthly\"<br />\nthat should logically have created a sensation. I wonder if many<br />\ndo not sneer because they fear to be of the type that would read<br />\nthese publications; the type of the fashionable, cultured dilettante,<br />\nthe pseudo-sophisticated, smart man-about-town who talks airily<br />\nof wine, women and song, books, music, and the races. There are<br />\nfew of this type at Hopkins, and all are confined to one fraternity,<br />\nbut in spite of their hypocrisy, their poses and their smart smalltalk, I think we could stand more. But to return. \"Beau\" is one<br />\nof the most beautiful printing jobs issued; it is illustrated with<br />\nwood-cuts and prints by the most popular of impressionists ; it<br />\nhas that metropolitan taste, that cultured and bored air which appeals so to worshippers of Adolph Menjou; more--it has, (here's<br />\nthe climax) some of the most questionable well written stuff any<br />\neditor has dared to print. \"Two Worlds,\" if you cannot be considered smart, contains stories by Catulle Mendes (ask Dr.<br />\nShanks), Arthur Machen (ask a Phi Psi), David Lawrence (ask<br />\nDad; he knows), and a host of others. Men whose writings have<br />\nthe double attraction of intrinsic value and immediate appeal.<br />\nBut as I said, Hopkins is either conservative or stupid. I<br />\nrefer, of course, to the undergraduate school, whose reaction, if<br />\nany, to the above suggestion, will be either \"I'm too busy reading 'Midsummer Night's Dream',\" or \"I never heard of them.\"<br />\nTo the former I whisper, \"Apple-sauce.\" To the latter, in case<br />\nthey don't fill the gap with the Saturday Evening Post, the Cosmopolitan, Collier's, and other advertising agencies, nor yet with<br />\nsuch scrap-books of dull scraps as the Literary Digest, and Time,<br />\nI offer the \"Golden Book.\" There, at least, will be found familiar<br />\nnames. There one cannot possibly find anything offensively modern. Selections from every author worthy of recognition are used,<br />\nthe choices are almost invariably good, the book is thick, and costs<br />\nonly a quarter. No; I do not get a commission; my motives are<br />\nselfish, for I always fear the embarrassment of nothing to talk<br />\nabout.<br />\nI have a sneaking suspicion that several seniors read the Review of Reviews, Harper's, and the Atlantic Monthly. If I am<br />\nright, I apologize and retire blushingly for, having presumed to<br />\nsuggest. I know nothing about present-day problems, the Chinese<br />\ntrouble (did you read Mencken Monday? He says \"coolies\" is<br />\nevidently a Chinese distortion of the American \"Coolidges\"), or<br />\nthe Nicaraguan dispute, nor will anyone who follows my outline<br />\nfor magazine reading gain any information on these unquestionably important topics, but\u2014well, I have a course with Dr. Turner<br />\nanyway, and I always leave his class with a bloody and triumphant<br />\nfeeling as if I had \"maneuvered my forces with marvellous rapidity\" or \"handled diplomatic affairs with considerable shrewdness.\"<br />\nSo that something witty, exciting, or perhaps a little . . . suggestive, will always appeal to me.<br />\nBut I observe, on revision, that I have gotten enthusiastic.<br />\nFor that I apologize. It is shocking taste for a Hopkins man to<br />\nget enthusiastic about anything even remotely associated with<br />\nstudy, as. magazines possibly are. Again, I notice that I have earnestly suggested to the mass that it read for amusement. All<br />\nright; don't shout at me. I'm aware that \"reading isn't amusement, that Octavus Roy Cohen writes for the Post, and that the<br />\nPost costs a nickel. Besides, I hardly ever have time to read. . .\"<br />\n<br />\nA. H.

Dr.<br />\nMiles worked this out by reading passages from \"The Eve of<br />\nSaint Agnes.\" He weaves into<br />\nhis poetry the soft beauty of nature.

All three<br />\ngrew more intense until his untimely death at the age of twenty-one. \"The greatest thing about<br />\nKeats,\" said Dr. Miles \"is that his<br />\nPoetry has no moral; it is just<br />\nbeautiful.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe plot, which deals primarily<br />\nwith the misunderstandings that<br />\narise from false scandal about<br />\nthe relations between an old man,<br />\nhis beautiful young wife, and a<br />\nthird party, has very little love<br />\ninterest.

Accordingly, the brick<br />\nbarn situated near the southerly entrance to the campus was renovated to meet the situation.<br />\nTradition clothes our homely Barn with dearest memories.<br />\nEspecially has its Trophy Room and surrounding offices become,<br />\nto a great extent, the heart of the campus.<br />\nBut as we watch and listen to the pulsating of that heart today, we fail to find anything endearing or beautiful about it\u2014at<br />\nleast between the hours of ten and four. What was once a Trophy<br />\nRoom has become a bums' hang-out.<br />\nTo be sure, the Barn should be a place for refreshment and<br />\npleasure. Card games in themselves are perfectly harmless. But<br />\nwhen those same games give rise to a constant stream of curses<br />\nand continual arguments between the players, we fail to, find<br />\nanything salutary about them. The card players constitute a<br />\ngroup of students who, for the most part, make themselves extremely obnoxious by their blatant clamor, their continual brawling, their utter disregard for property, public and personal, and<br />\ntheir lack of cleanliness.<br />\nWe do not pretend to be \"uplifts\" or \"clean-ups,\" but we do<br />\nsuggest that the offenders either mend their ways or get out. If<br />\nno improvement is noticed, it would be well for the Student Council to exercise its prerogative as custodian of the Trophy Room.<br /><br />\nIT CAN'T BE LONG NOW<br />\nThe elimination of English Composition I from the curriculum of the College of Arts and Sciences is just another .milestone in the inauguration of the New Plan. \"English Comp.\"<br />\nfollows in the footsteps of elementary language courses, which<br />\nwere stricken from the list of available subjects last year.<br />\nNot only, however, have English Composition and English<br />\nLiterature I been dropped, but, as Dean Ames recently explained,<br />\nthe entire range of courses open to A. B. candidates has been<br />\nmaterially shortened. According to the Dean's statement in the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER last month, \"these courses are arranged so as to<br />\ngive a well-rounded general education or to prepare for admission to the study of medicine, law, etc.\" With such a narrow<br />\nchoice before them, however, we doubt very much whether many<br />\nstudents will desire to enter the College on that basis. Most young<br />\nmen wanting the sort of \"general education\" to which the Dean<br />\nrefers will want a larger choice than the revised catalogue will<br />\noffer, and, consequently, instead of not entering the undergraduate school specifically because they are told that they may not,<br />\nthey will desist from doing so voluntarily.<br />\nFor all practical purposes, it would seem; then, that the New<br />\nPlan is in actual operation. It is very difficult to predict how many<br />\nmen will enter under the New Plan next fall, but it does not take a<br />\ngenius to see that the number entering the old system will be<br />\ngreatly decreased.<br /><br />\n\"YES and NO\"<br />\nIf you allow the truth of a statement made by a professor<br />\nEnglish,<br />\nto the effect that 'students occasionally read assigned<br />\nof<br />\nliterature, but seldom to more purpose than a feeling of defense<br />\nagainst a possible quiz question, it will be more remarkable that<br />\nmagazines play so small.a part in undergraduate life. To be sure,<br />\na junior recently told me that he hadn't time for such drivel as<br />\n\"Cyrano de Bergerac\" because. the Cosmopolitan was running<br />\na story of Adela Rogers St. John's, but I refer rather to magazines cOntaining something better than yarns of contemporary and<br />\npeculiarly insane college life.<br />\nCertainly the average college student has a keen eye for<br />\nsmut, or, if you are offended by the word, at least for the slightly<br />\nerotic, in literature. No, not \"Artists and Models\"; that is seldom read and never bought;\u2014one turns its gaudy pages eagerly<br />\nwhile drinking a Coca-Cola--nor any of its artistic ilk. But there<br />\nare two magazines, \"Beau\", and \"The Two Worlds Monthly\"<br />\nthat should logically have created a sensation. I wonder if many<br />\ndo not sneer because they fear to be of the type that would read<br />\nthese publications; the type of the fashionable, cultured dilettante,<br />\nthe pseudo-sophisticated, smart man-about-town who talks airily<br />\nof wine, women and song, books, music, and the races. There are<br />\nfew of this type at Hopkins, and all are confined to one fraternity,<br />\nbut in spite of their hypocrisy, their poses and their smart smalltalk, I think we could stand more. But to return. \"Beau\" is one<br />\nof the most beautiful printing jobs issued; it is illustrated with<br />\nwood-cuts and prints by the most popular of impressionists ; it<br />\nhas that metropolitan taste, that cultured and bored air which appeals so to worshippers of Adolph Menjou; more--it has, (here's<br />\nthe climax) some of the most questionable well written stuff any<br />\neditor has dared to print. \"Two Worlds,\" if you cannot be considered smart, contains stories by Catulle Mendes (ask Dr.<br />\nShanks), Arthur Machen (ask a Phi Psi), David Lawrence (ask<br />\nDad; he knows), and a host of others. Men whose writings have<br />\nthe double attraction of intrinsic value and immediate appeal.<br />\nBut as I said, Hopkins is either conservative or stupid. I<br />\nrefer, of course, to the undergraduate school, whose reaction, if<br />\nany, to the above suggestion, will be either \"I'm too busy reading 'Midsummer Night's Dream',\" or \"I never heard of them.\"<br />\nTo the former I whisper, \"Apple-sauce.\" To the latter, in case<br />\nthey don't fill the gap with the Saturday Evening Post, the Cosmopolitan, Collier's, and other advertising agencies, nor yet with<br />\nsuch scrap-books of dull scraps as the Literary Digest, and Time,<br />\nI offer the \"Golden Book.\" There, at least, will be found familiar<br />\nnames. There one cannot possibly find anything offensively modern. Selections from every author worthy of recognition are used,<br />\nthe choices are almost invariably good, the book is thick, and costs<br />\nonly a quarter. No; I do not get a commission; my motives are<br />\nselfish, for I always fear the embarrassment of nothing to talk<br />\nabout.<br />\nI have a sneaking suspicion that several seniors read the Review of Reviews, Harper's, and the Atlantic Monthly. If I am<br />\nright, I apologize and retire blushingly for, having presumed to<br />\nsuggest. I know nothing about present-day problems, the Chinese<br />\ntrouble (did you read Mencken Monday? He says \"coolies\" is<br />\nevidently a Chinese distortion of the American \"Coolidges\"), or<br />\nthe Nicaraguan dispute, nor will anyone who follows my outline<br />\nfor magazine reading gain any information on these unquestionably important topics, but\u2014well, I have a course with Dr. Turner<br />\nanyway, and I always leave his class with a bloody and triumphant<br />\nfeeling as if I had \"maneuvered my forces with marvellous rapidity\" or \"handled diplomatic affairs with considerable shrewdness.\"<br />\nSo that something witty, exciting, or perhaps a little . . . suggestive, will always appeal to me.<br />\nBut I observe, on revision, that I have gotten enthusiastic.<br />\nFor that I apologize. It is shocking taste for a Hopkins man to<br />\nget enthusiastic about anything even remotely associated with<br />\nstudy, as. magazines possibly are. Again, I notice that I have earnestly suggested to the mass that it read for amusement. All<br />\nright; don't shout at me. I'm aware that \"reading isn't amusement, that Octavus Roy Cohen writes for the Post, and that the<br />\nPost costs a nickel. Besides, I hardly ever have time to read. . .\"<br /><br />\nA. H.
