This is to compensate for those<br />\napplicants who are accepted at more than one<br />\nschool and must reject those they decide not to<br />\nattend. Mr. Brinley pointed out that Hopkins<br />\nusually receives about twenty-five of these<br />\nrejections over the summer. Although no one<br />\nknows why, only five were received this year<br />\nresulting in an unsually large freshman class.<br />\nThe make-up of the class is similar to those of<br />\nprevious years. The 540 were chosen from a<br />\ntotal of 2792 applying seniors. Scholastically<br />\nthey ,lie well within the top ten percent of the<br />\nnation's entering college freshmen.<br />\nGeographically the majority come from the<br />\nEast, with Maryland's 150 being the largest<br />\nsingle group.

Similarly<br />\nthe ideal number of engineers would be around<br />\n100 rather than the 68 that were finally<br />\naccepted.<br />\nThe Director explained the problem in<br />\nHumanities as one of \"skewed distribution.\"<br />\nThe reputation of Hopkins as a science school is<br />\nsuch that the University receives few<br />\napplications in other areas. This year's 54<br />\nhumanities majors were chosen from only 200<br />\napplicants while the 234 natural science majors<br />\ncame from over 1400 applications. As to<br />\nengineers, Mr. Brinkley noted that most of the<br />\nengineering majors come from either Baltimore<br />\nor other Maryland towns. He said that more<br />\nengineering applicants are desired, but that the<br />\nUniversity seems to have no \"engineering image<br />\noutside of Maryland.\"<br />\nVarious efforts are now under way not only<br />\nto increase the recruiting capacity of the Office,<br />\nbut also to improve the University's image<br />\nabroad.

HOELSCHER<br />\nNews Director<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, the President of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Russell<br />\nA. Nelson, stated that moves towards<br />\nunionization of the non-professional<br />\nHospital employees \"is not in the best<br />\ninterests of the public, patients<br />\nor ...employees\" and may lead to a<br />\n$20-a-day increase in present hospital<br />\nrates. Last week Local 1199E of the<br />\nHospital and Nursing Home Employees<br />\nUnion won the right to represent<br />\nHospital employees in<br />\nLabor/management negotiations.<br />\nThe immediate effect of the<br />\nunionization of the Hospital will<br />\nremain unclear until the negotiations<br />\nbetween union and Hospital officials<br />\nhave been completed. Nevertheless,<br />\nNelson did indicate significant<br />\nmisgivings over the union's success.<br />\nIn a letter to all hospital employees<br />\nDr. Nelson states that\"by winning the<br />\nright to represent these<br />\nemployees ... the union has assumed<br />\ntremendous responsibilities.<br />\n\"During the campaign the union<br />\nmade many promises that concern us<br />\nand concern us now.\" He said that it is<br />\n\"greatly difficult, if not impossible\" for<br />\nthe hospital to meet these promises.<br />\nPrimary concern of the hospital<br />\nadministration rests with the union's<br />\ndemand for $100 minimum weekly<br />\nsalary ($2.50 per hour). At present, the<br />\nminimum wage at the hospital is $1.80<br />\nper hour, 35 cents above the<br />\nFederalminimum wage for hospital<br />\nworkers.<br />\nNecessary Updating<br />\nNelson admitted that the present<br />\nminimum level at Hopkins is low, but<br />\n<br />\nnoted that the hospital has committed<br />\nitself to raising that wage. He did not<br />\nspecify the amount of the proposed<br />\nincrease or when such a re-evaluation<br />\nwould by conducted, however.<br />\nPaul J. Van Nevel, chief public<br />\nrelations officer for Hopkins, also<br />\nwarned against the sudden cost increase<br />\nresulting from the demands. It would lie<br />\nargues, lead \"to a ripple effect resulting<br />\nin a raise that could not be borne by the<br />\nhospital, while affecting many other<br />\nsegments of society.\"<br />\n\"The hospital's reaction,\" countered<br />\nFred Punch, chief organizer of 1199E,<br />\n\"is typical of any other profiteer.<br />\nRather than reduce profits he would<br />\nvisit the added expense on those who<br />\ncan least afford it - - the patients.\"<br />\nOther union demands include an end<br />\nto forced retirement, free life insurance,<br />\nfree hospitalization and respect for<br />\nseniority.<br />\nNelson stated that despite past<br />\ndifficulties, he hoped \"differences can<br />\nbe resolved in fair bargaining between<br />\nunion and hospital representatives. We<br />\nhope, too, that the union will place the<br />\npublic interest predominently among its<br />\nobjectives, as the hospital does.\"<br />\nPunch echoed Nelson's statement:<br />\n\"Our issues are firm but we will enter all<br />\nnegotiations in the true spirit of<br />\ncollective bargaining.\"<br />\nWhen asked about union policy for<br />\nthe future, Punch replied, however,\"We<br />\ncannot negotiate on the media, our<br />\nposition is clear.\"<br />\nThe major portion of Local 1199E's<br />\ncampaign for unionization of all<br />\nnon-professional hospital employees<br />\nbegan over the summer months.

The new National<br />\nAlumni Schools Committee,-headed by<br />\nthe Hon. Robert I. H. Hammerman of<br />\nBaltimore's Supreme Bench, will serve<br />\nas an overseeing and co-ordinating body.<br />\nThe overall objectives of the Committee<br />\nwill be to \"organize Johns Hopkins<br />\nalumni in each state in the nation,\" he<br />\nsaid, and Special emphasis will be placed<br />\non regions like the far west, where the<br />\nUniversity generally attracts fewer<br />\napplicants.<br />\nThe Committee will be aided by<br />\nAssistant Director of Admissions<br />\nMichael Anderson, who will help with<br />\nthe organization as well as providing the<br />\nlocal committees with access to the<br />\nnecessary Admissions Office reports and<br />\nrecords. Mr. Anderson noted a number<br />\nof reasons for the reorganization.<br />\nPrimarily the University wants to<br />\nmaintain its national prestige by<br />\ncontinuing to draw students from all<br />\nparts of the country. Mr. Anderson<br />\nexpressed the long term goal as \"having<br />\nevery school in the country\" available<br />\nto the Committee. Short term plans are<br />\nto cover \"every major city and every<br />\nstate.\"<br />\nYouthful Image<br />\nThe need for Alumni assistance arises<br />\nfrom the inability of the small<br />\nAdmissions Office staff to adequately<br />\ncover all the possible applicants. The<br />\nintense competion from other schools<br />\nmakes it necessary to search out talent<br />\nwherever it appears, explained<br />\nAnderson. The Alumni Committee will<br />\nact in this area, seeking out qualified<br />\nstudents and.generating applications to.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe national organization will<br />\nappoint a chairman for each local group.<br />\nThese will then choose their own local<br />\ncommittees. Although there are no<br />\nstrict requirements, the general<br />\nguidelines suggest that a prospective<br />\ncounselor be a Homewood graduate<br />\nwith a bachelor's degree. Recent<br />\ngraduates are particularly sought by the<br />\ncommittee in hopes that \"their young<br />\nimage will enable the applicants to<br />\nbetter identify with them.<br />\nIn another area of the recruiting<br />\nprocess. the Undergraduate Admissions<br />\nCouncil has received the support of the<br />\nAdmissions Office for its plans to help<br />\ncounsel prospective applicants. The<br />\nCouncil was formed last year to allow<br />\nHomewood undergraduates to contact<br />\ninterested high school students, in an<br />\nattempt to give them a fuller picture of<br />\nuniversity life. Plans will be announced<br />\nlater this year for the selection of<br />\nCouncil Aides who will meet with the<br />\nprospects in their home towns over the<br />\nChristmas recess.<br />\nNo Status<br />\nThe Admissions Council was created<br />\nlast fall by the Student Council. At that<br />\ntime the plan called for the Council to<br />\noperate as an official part of the Office<br />\nof Admissions.<br />\nThe Admissions Office, however, will<br />\ngrant the Council neither official nor<br />\nsemi-official status (they must operate,<br />\nstated Anderson, as \"interested<br />\nindividuals\"). Yet the Office has<br />\nwelcomed their support and will in fact<br />\nask them to contact a number of the<br />\nUniversity's prime prospects.<br />\nAccording to Assistant Director<br />\nAnderson, the lack of status is a matter<br />\nof \"ethics and confidentiality.\" High<br />\nand prep school guidance councelors are<br />\nextremely sensitive in the area of<br />\nextending confidential information to<br />\nnon-staff members. Thus while<br />\nundergraduates are in an excellent<br />\nposition to help with recruiting, the<br />\njudgement functions must be left to<br />\nqualified staff members.<br />\n<br />\n\f9<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n, OMEWOOD BM_ TimORE SEPT. 12 1969<br />\n<br />\nGraf Extols LSD<br />\nAs Therapy Aid<br />\n<br />\ndammerman Raps<br />\nDated Drug Laws<br />\n\"Don't get caught,\" was Judge Robert<br />\nHammerman's advice to freshmen at the drug<br />\nseminar held at Turner Hall last Friday as part of<br />\nFreshman orientation.<br />\nHammerman, who sits on the Supreme Bench<br />\nof. Baltimore City, attacked our drug laws as<br />\nbeing \"archaic, inconsistent, and unrealistic.\" He<br />\nnoted, however, that \"Hopkins is not a<br />\n.sa nctuary and students are subject to all the<br />\ninequalities of the law.\"<br />\nThese were the same points emphasized by Judge<br />\nHammerman when he spoke at the<br />\ntudent-faculty meeting immediately after the dormitory<br />\nrug bust of last spring. The midnight bust resulted<br />\n11 the arrest of three freshmen for possession of<br />\nnarcotics. Two were charged with possession of<br />\namphetamines; one with possession of marijuana.<br />\nBust Followed by Sit-In<br />\nThe bust was immediately followed by a massive four<br />\na.m. sit-in on President Gordon's lawn. The University<br />\nacted quickly to make sure that none of the individuals'<br />\nrights had been violated. The three students were<br />\nindicted, but during the summer the state's attorney<br />\ndropped all charges against them.<br />\nMaryland law, explained judge Hammerman, classifies<br />\nillegal drugs' as either narcotic or dangerous. Heroin,<br />\nmorphine, cocaine, opium, and mairjuana are all.<br />\nClassified as narcotics. Thus possession and use of these<br />\ndrugs are felonies punishable by fines up to $1000 and<br />\nimprisonment up to five years. LSD, mescaline,<br />\namphetamines, and barbituates are classed as dangerous<br />\ndrugs. Possession of these drugs is a misdemeanor<br />\nPunishable by fines up to $500 and imprisonment up to<br />\nOne year. The penalty for use of LSD is a fine of up to<br />\n$100. \"If someone approaches you who looks like<br />\nthe<br />\nfuzz swallow the stuff,\" counselled Judge<br />\nHammerman.<br />\n<br />\n\"If someone approaches you who looks like the fuzz, swallow<br />\nthe stuf advice from Jud e Robert Hammerman.<br />\n<br />\nArrests Up 1,860%<br />\nF.B.I. statistics indicate that the number of young<br />\nPeople arrested for drugs was 1,860%'higher in 1968<br />\nthan in 1960. \"The rise is due primarily to marijuana<br />\narrests,\" said Judge Hammerman.<br />\n\"The laws have not been modernized because<br />\npoliticians take their impressions from where the votes<br />\nare. There is a mood in the country today of repression<br />\nagainst young people.\"<br />\nWhat happens when a person is arrested for<br />\nmarijuana, noted the judge, is purely a matter of chance.'<br />\nGreat discretionary power is given to the judge. Some.<br />\nudges will not give young people records.<br />\n\"Most Judges Conservative\"<br />\nBut Judge Hammerman added that \"judges for the<br />\nMost part are conservative.

There are no symptoms which always occur in<br />\nLSD sessions.\" Thus, he asserted, few of the bad things<br />\nsaid about LSD relate to LSD itself.<br />\nRather, Dr. Graf explained, the bad things relate to<br />\nthe context in which LSD is taken. When LSD is taken<br />\nunder uncontrolled conditions, several factors can create<br />\na serious risk. The user is uncertain about the<br />\npharmaceutalogical content of his dose, paranoid about<br />\nthe possibility of being arrested, and may feel guilty<br />\nabout taking LSD in the first place.<br />\nA great sensation in the scientific world was caused<br />\nwhen LSD was first introduced for therapeutic purposes<br />\nin the 1950's. Dr. Graf delineated two therapeutic<br />\nmethods of utilitzing LSD, and showed several paintings<br />\ndrawn by his patients during periods of deep ecstasy and<br />\nagony, to illustrate states of mind attained through LSD<br />\nuse.<br />\nIn the \"psychedelic method,\" sessions are structured<br />\nso the subject will receive a deep mystical experience.<br />\nBefore the session a doctor goes through the patient's<br />\nhistory in order to give the patient some idea of how his<br />\nsymptoms are related to his problems. The psychedelic<br />\nmethod is most commonly used with alcoholics to aid<br />\nthem in developing will power. It is also used to help<br />\nterminal cancer patients reconcile themselves with death.<br />\nDr. Graf described the \"psycholytic method\" as an<br />\n\"intensification of psychoanalysis\" where LSD aids the<br />\npatient in transcending himself in -order to understand<br />\nand deal with his problems. As in psychoanalysis, the<br />\nanalyst attempts to enter into the patient's world. ,<br />\nDr. Graf stressed that drugs have existed in nearly all<br />\ncultures throughout the ages. Hashish has been widely<br />\nused throughout the Orient. In Mexico, the home<br />\ncountry of hallucinogenics, peyote, morning - glory seeds<br />\nand sacred mushrooms have been widely used. \"What is<br />\nsensational about LSD,\" stated Dr. Graf, \"is the<br />\nincredible potency of minute closets.\"<br />\nDr. Graf suggested that the long term result of<br />\nmarijuana use is \"very similar to what you see with<br />\nrepeated use of LSD. People start losing their drive for<br />\nachievement and begin to place much more emphasis on<br />\njoy, pleasure, and doing things for their own sake.\"<br />\nLSD was first discovered in Switzerland thirty years<br />\nago during gynecological research.

Traditional<br />\ndependence on self-discipline by<br />\nmembers of the academic<br />\ncommunity does not in fact always<br />\nprevent actions prejudicial to a<br />\nuniversity's best interests.

This may well be the most important resolution<br />\nwhich the Council will be called upon to consider all year.<br />\nThe idea that students should have something to say about the<br />\neducation they receive at Hopkins has been paid much lip service in<br />\nprevious years. However, the students' voice was always ensconced in<br />\nsome committee, ignored by those who wielded the real power, and not<br />\nheard by those whom the \"representatives\" were supposedly speaking for.<br />\nNow the Student Council as the chance to make genuine headway in the<br />\nfight to make students a part of this university. There can be no<br />\njustification for not taking it.<br />\nThe notion that students can design a course is not revolutionary, even<br />\nm the mildest sense of the word. However, the fact that Hopkins students<br />\nwould be able to design their own course, choose the professor who<br />\nteaches it and get academic credit for it is a tremendous step in the right<br />\ndirection. If the course has some relevance to the lives of students in<br />\n1969, the achievement will be nothing short of miraculous.<br />\nThe resolution and the original idea for its design began with Manuel<br />\nRodriguez. Rodriguez originally planned to present the plan to the Council<br />\nlast Monday. Discussions with professors concerning the best way to<br />\ninsure adoption of the proposal convinced him to postpone its appearance<br />\nuntil this coming Monday. We hope that the professors have not<br />\nconvinced him to water down the resolution as well.<br />\nProblems with implementation of the proposal center around the<br />\nattitude of the Academic Council. If past performance is any indication,<br />\nwe can expect that'many members of the Council (and the faculty at\u2022<br />\nlarge) will be against this attempt to provide a course of the students' own<br />\ndesign. Moreover, the Academic Council might be expected to issue forth<br />\nwith some very fancy verbiage on the nature of the university and who<br />\nshould determine what is taught.<br />\nThe fact is, the idea that the students could design a course for<br />\nacademic credit may prove frightening to some members of the faculty.<br />\nConstrued from any point of view, this resolution represents an attempt<br />\nto assume student responsiblity in an area which was previously the<br />\n<br />\n1 11AD<br />\nCHWITO c=:)<br />\nso I<br />\nccaP<br />\nFPEE<br />\nOF<br />\n6F,Cea-<br />\n<br />\nMoekrer?<br />\n(.3Eopc,<br />\nCOMP'<br />\n<br />\nFReE<br />\nOF MY<br />\nt1/440111ER.<br />\n<br />\nMT<br />\nFAcK To<br />\n66(RGE<br />\nSo I<br />\nCOULD<br />\n166 REE<br />\nOF Sula:<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nexclusive domain of faculty and administration.

In<br />\naddition, we hope that the Council and the student body will not be<br />\ndissuaded from taking this step because of the objections which will<br />\ndoubtless be raised by the more conservative elements of the faculty.<br />\n<br />\nA Question of Attitude<br />\nIt is unclear how the 50 or so Freshmen who attended last Sunday's<br />\npanel discussion in the Garrett Room reacted to that introductory session;<br />\nfor those of use whose memories of Hopkins took on a rather rosy glow<br />\nover the summer, it was quite a rude re-awakening.<br />\nThat the discussion was bland and relatively uninformative can be<br />\nexcused and attributed to an end-of-the-summer lethargy and the fact that<br />\nthe Freshmen, who made up most of the audience, were inexperienced<br />\nand unable to question the panelists or analyze their statements properly.<br />\nThat the entire discussion was carried on in an air of astonishing<br />\ncondescension is not so easily excused. It is an insult to the students and<br />\npoints up vividly the vast gap between the attitudes of the faculty and the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nThe gap is further widened when one notes that at least two of the four<br />\npanelists - - Professors Wolman and Mann - - are very liberally oriented.<br />\nThe outlook on the faculty as a whole is even bleaker.<br />\nThe most pertinent question of the afternoon - - and the one which<br />\ndrew the least satisfactory responses - - concerned the University's<br />\ncommittee system. It was suggested that perhaps the student-faculty<br />\ncommittees could be restructured so as to include equal numbers of<br />\nstudents and professors. In response, Dr. Swanson stated that he thought<br />\nthe system was working well as it is; Dr. Wolman, though he was \"unable<br />\nexactly to say why,\" did not like the idea; and Dr. Mandelbaum, pointing<br />\nout the necessity of various specialized faculty members on each<br />\ncommittee, condemned the idea of equality \"for equality's sake.\" The last<br />\ncontention ignored the fact that students, too, have specialities and varied<br />\ninterests. All three, while disparaging the contention, maintained that<br />\ndisagreements never broke down along student-faculty lines.<br />\nDr. Mann - - who claimed that since students are in effect asking for a<br />\n'passport' to future jobs, it is up to professors to determine the<br />\ngraduation requirements - - made a good point. However his example<br />\nholds only for a very limited case. Inmost other instances, students do<br />\nhave a claim to legitimate and real rather than illusory involvement in the<br />\npresent and future policies of the University.<br />\nStudent unrest is directly related to faculty and administrative<br />\ncondescension. The phrase \"meaningful discussion\" is not jargon in this<br />\ncase - - it is the only way to insure tranquility on this and other campuses<br />\nacross the nation.<br />\n<br />\nHo Chi Minh<br />\nHo was above all a nationalist, and it was for nationalism that he<br />\nfought for thirty years. First against the Japanese.

Their demise<br />\nwas followed by an album called<br />\n\"Goodbye\" \u2014 interesting in some spots but generally<br />\nvery disappointing.<br />\nSo \"Wheels of Fire\", released a year ago this summer,<br />\nwas the last new music that Eric Clapton put out until<br />\nthe Blind Faith album.<br />\nIn an atmosphere of skillful advance publicity and<br />\nreverence for Cream (British rock magazines are still<br />\nasking, \"Who'll fill the gap left by Cream's break-up?\"),<br />\nBlind Faith with Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Steve<br />\nWinwood in the same band, was eagerly anticipated as<br />\nthe first of the supergroups.<br />\nBut alas, friends, a supergroup in name only. First<br />\ncame their disappointing premier performance in Hyde<br />\nPark in London, then the fiasco of their American<br />\nconcert tour. So everyone waited for the record. They<br />\ngotta be better on record. To make the situation worse,<br />\nthe album release date was 'postponed from June 22<br />\nuntil the beginning of August. ATCO Records should<br />\nhave postponed it indefinitely.<br />\nRacked Voice<br />\nMy dissatisfaction with the Blind Faith album is<br />\ncaused mainly by the ubiquitous presence of Steve<br />\nWinwood. He must be credited with \"Can't Find My<br />\nWay Home\", the best song on the album, but his other<br />\ntunes, \"Had to Cry Today\" and \"Sea of Joy\", are<br />\nreminiscent of his late songs for Traffic: long,<br />\nuneventful, and soporific.<br />\nWindood's singing also causes problems. Many people<br />\ncan tolerate/enjoy his thin high-pitched vocals, in which<br />\nit seems he stretches his voice to the breaking point. I<br />\ncan't. And in the Hyde Park concert Winwood's voice<br />\n<br />\ncracked so often that the situation soon passed from<br />\nembarrasing to annoying. Definitely not a Jack Bruce.<br />\nSome of the blame for this uninteresting album must<br />\nbe placed on the other musicians. Ginger Baker<br />\ncontinues to bang and thrash away, straining under the<br />\nbelief that he has not yet impressed upon us his celerity<br />\nand agility. Okay Ginger, we're impressed. And the<br />\npuerile lyrics to his interminable song (which isn't even a<br />\nsong) need not be criticized here.<br />\nRoutine Playing<br />\nClapton is the saddest tragedy of the album. His<br />\nacoustic fingering on \"Can't Find My Way Home\" is<br />\nexcellent, as is his solo in \"Presence of the Lord,\" an<br />\ninstrumental that slides from violence to tranquility and<br />\nhas almost no connection with the rest of the song. An<br />\nexplanation for this disjunction can perhaps be found in<br />\nthe song's lyrics (by Clapton), but this seems to be<br />\natrributing more mental resourcefulness to Clapton than<br />\nhe has otherwise demonstrated. The remainder of his<br />\nplaying is very unexciting and routine, with no<br />\nadvancement at all in the last year. He has yet to surpass<br />\nsome of his solos on \"Fresh Cream,\", an album now<br />\nthree years old.<br />\nAnd as for Rick Grech. His bass solo in \"Do What<br />\nYou Like\" is perhaps the most unimaginative and boring<br />\npiece of music to be published anywhere in a long time.<br />\nAgain, he is definitely not a Jack Bruce.<br />\nIf you were disappointed with the Blind Faith album,<br />\nat least you knew who were going to perform the songs.<br />\nNot so in the case of \"Truly Fine Citizen,\" the latest<br />\nrelease by Moby Grape, a once great San Francisco<br />\ngroup whose record \"Wow\" still ranks as a marvelous<br />\nand enjoyable head album. The back jacket of \"Truly<br />\nFine Citizen\" consists of individual photographs of the<br />\nfour members of the band, three of them easily<br />\n<br />\nrecognizable and the fourth with his back to the viewer,<br />\nanonymous.<br />\nOnly upon opening the record and listening to it (i.e.<br />\nafter putting down the shekels) do we discover the<br />\ndeception we have fallen victim to. Bob Mosley, a<br />\ncompetent song-writer and the Grape's bassist and lead<br />\nvocalist, has gone away, to be inadequately replaced by<br />\nthe mystery man on the back of the cover.<br />\nSo what are we left with? A mediocre album of<br />\ncountry-rock on which one song is indistinguishable<br />\nfrom the next (mystery man wrote most of the songs.)<br />\nSome 44 executives at Columbia Records are laughing at<br />\nhow simple it is to bilk ignorant record buyers. Caveat<br />\nemptor etc. etc.<br />\nNo Cello<br />\nThe magazines may as well continue searching tor a<br />\nreplacement for Cream; the vacuum is still a vacuum.<br />\nMoby Grape has traded talent and honesty for an<br />\nunidentified bgiF player. The scene looks bad, but not<br />\ndesolate. Jack Bruce has an album,\"Songs for a Tailor\",<br />\nto be released in November. It is supposed to be jazz,<br />\nwith no cello playing. And he is preparing another<br />\nrecord with guitarist Larry Coryell. Then there is the<br />\nvery talented anthology of Crosby, Stills, Nash and<br />\nYoung.<br />\nEven more promising is Jethro Tull, an English group<br />\nwhose second album, \"Stand Up\", is a definite<br />\nimprovement over the first. Ian Anderson's flute work is<br />\nmore restrained, melodic and enjoyable on the second;<br />\nhis vocals are smoother. Guitar player Mick Abrahams<br />\nhas left to form Bloodwyn Pig, a blues band. His<br />\nreplacement, a gentleman with the doubtful name of<br />\nMartin Lancelot Barre, is competent. But Anderson<br />\nmakes Jethro Tull and \"Stand Up\" a successful one-mat<br />\nshow.<br />\n<br />\nono<br />\nf<br />\nor<br />\nnor<br />\n<br />\nuliV1Z1<br />\n<br />\n;h<br />\nit tal<br />\n<br />\n!<br />\n>ii<br />\n<br />\n::<br />\n<br />\nrhE<br />\n<br />\nes<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nup<br />\nTs<br />\n<br />\nNe(<br />\n<br />\n'un<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\nl 11na<br />\n11(<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\nbo<br />\n<br />\nrc<br />\n<br />\nOur American Heritage<br />\n<br />\nCleveland's Out; Let's Push Parker<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nOne of the most perplexing facts<br />\nof American history is the fact that<br />\nthe Democratic candidate for<br />\nPresident in 1904 was Alton Brooks<br />\nParker. In no other case can it be said<br />\nwith such certainty that if the man<br />\nhad lost the nomination he would<br />\nnow be entirely unknown. There is a<br />\ntraditional facile explanation of the<br />\nnomination which at least accounts<br />\nfor the superficial procedures.<br />\nWilliam Jennings Bryan had lost<br />\nstature in the party after his defeat<br />\nof 1900 which was more severe than<br />\nhis loss in 1896. The right to name<br />\nthe party nominee thereupon<br />\nreverted to the right wing of the<br />\nDemoc- atic party, which had chosen<br />\nand continued to respect former<br />\nPresident Grover Cleveland.<br />\nEarly in 1904 the 67-year-old Mr.<br />\nCleveland declined to be considered<br />\nfor the nomination. The Eastern<br />\nparty organizations thereupon swung<br />\nbehind Mr. Cleveland's choice.<br />\nJustice Parker. Mr. Parker had been<br />\nelected Chief Justice of the New<br />\nYork State Court of Appeals in<br />\n1897, when the Democrats were<br />\nsingularly weak in New York, and<br />\nwas the only Democrat to carry the<br />\nstate since Mr. Cleveland's re-election<br />\nas President in 1892.<br />\nNot Bitterly Contested<br />\nFaced with this adequate<br />\nexplanation, it is still difficult to<br />\naccept a major party nomination of a<br />\nman whose opinions on major issues<br />\nand personality was unknown to the<br />\nvast majority of Americans, and even<br />\nto many of those insidehis state.<br />\nJustice Parker had spent most of his<br />\npolitical career on the bench, and so<br />\nhad not been in a position to express<br />\nhimself on contemporary issues.<br />\nParker admittedly won a<br />\nstatewide election in 1897, but a<br />\njudicial election is not normally<br />\ncontested as bitterly as a campaign<br />\nfor Governor, in which any candidate<br />\n<br />\nmust express himself on major issues.<br />\nIn fact, he had been declining almost<br />\nbiennially to be the gubernatorial<br />\ncandidate. Had he been Governor, he<br />\nwould have been a far stronger<br />\ncandidate for President.<br />\nPersonal Ambition<br />\nTo be sure, something of Justice<br />\nParker's opinions may be gathered<br />\nfrom his judicial decisions, in which<br />\nhe seemed to favor labor unions, and<br />\nfrom an analysis of his associates.<br />\nJustice Parker was a former campaign<br />\nmanager for New York Senator<br />\nDavid B. Hill, and much was inferred<br />\nfrom his support from Mr. Cleveland.<br />\nHill had in fact opposed the<br />\nCleveland renomination of 1892,<br />\nchiefly due to personal ambition and<br />\na desire to build up his own wing of<br />\nthe party; Cleveland and Hill were<br />\nnot sufficiently far apart to disagree<br />\non the proposition that a leader had<br />\nto be found to succeed Mr. Bryan.<br />\nBoth Cleveland and Hill had more<br />\nfollowers than Parker, and neither<br />\nwas unambitious, but each was too<br />\nold to be a viable candidate.<br />\nMoreover, each had so manifested<br />\ntheir convictions as to be anathema<br />\nto the Bryan wing of the party. Not<br />\nenough was known about Parker to<br />\ninspire anyone's enmity.<br />\nSane Candidate<br />\nAnother factor recommending Mr.<br />\nParker was his position as a \"good,<br />\ngray\" judge in the circumstances of<br />\nthis election. The Republicans had a<br />\nprohibitively strong candidate in<br />\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt. As<br />\nmatters stood the election would be<br />\na referendum for or against<br />\nRoosevelt, and while the President<br />\nobviously had achieved a popularity<br />\nequaling idolatry among certain<br />\nvoters, any personality so strong and<br />\nabrasive is certain to acquire several<br />\nvoluble enemies.<br />\nCertain Presidential remarks,<br />\nalthough few Presidential elections,<br />\nhad upset the business community,<br />\nand the Democrats were hopeful that<br />\na \"safe and sane\" candidate L.ould<br />\n<br />\ngain Wail Street support against<br />\nRoosevelt. That Justice Parker had<br />\nrendered decisions comforting to<br />\nlabor organization was far less known<br />\nthan the fact that his principal<br />\nsponsor, former President Cleveland,<br />\nhad forcibly intervened against labor<br />\nin the Pullman strike of 1894.<br />\nThe very lack of forcefulness in<br />\nthe Justice's personality also<br />\nimproved his standing as a potential<br />\ncandidate against Roosevelt. It did<br />\nappear conceivable that, in a<br />\nreferendum against Roosevelt, there<br />\nwould be a large negative vote. If the<br />\nDemocrats had nominated a forceful<br />\npersonality of their own, such as<br />\nCleveland or William Randolph<br />\nHearst, he himself would have<br />\nalienated many voters. Parker was<br />\nnot sufficiently well-known to<br />\nalienate a voter who was prejudiced<br />\nagainst Roosevelt. He was therefore<br />\npotentially a fair candidate if, like<br />\nmany Democrats, one accepts the<br />\nproposition that the anti-Roosevelt<br />\nvote would be very large.<br />\nFrightful Attrition<br />\nStill, to say that Parker might<br />\nreceive votes because he appeared<br />\nsafe, sane, and coldly judicial is to<br />\ncorroborate, rather than to deny,<br />\nthat, to most of the American<br />\npeople, he was a vague personality<br />\nand an unknown quantity. The best<br />\nsin\" explanation for Parker's<br />\nnomination is that the Democratic<br />\nparty was singularly weak. This was<br />\npartially the fault of Bryan. Since he<br />\nhad become identified with the<br />\nparty, the Democrats had suffered<br />\nfrightful attrition in the large Eastern<br />\nstates which normally produced their<br />\npresidential candidates.<br />\nParker had recently won a<br />\nstatewide election, and this alone put<br />\nhim in the front rank of Eastern<br />\nDemocrats. When Bryan tried to<br />\nthink of an Easterner whom he might<br />\nmore cheerfully support, he could<br />\nmake no better suggestion than<br />\nformer Governor Pattison of<br />\nPennsylvania, who had recently been<br />\n<br />\ndefeated for re-election.<br />\nChicago Unpleasant<br />\nAs Bryan and Cleveland did not<br />\nchoose to run, none of .the figures<br />\nwho contested Parker's nomination<br />\nwas more magnetic. Delaware offered<br />\nformer Senator George Gray. Like<br />\nParker, Gray was a colorless and<br />\nrighteous judge; unlike Parker, he<br />\nhad never won an election in a<br />\npivotal state. Most of the Bryan<br />\nfollowing preferred publisher Hearst,<br />\nalthough there was no evidence he<br />\ncould be elected to any office. Hearst<br />\nhad been seeking the nomination far<br />\nmore assiduously than Parker; at one<br />\npoint, the Democractic National<br />\nCommittee was so concerned for<br />\nHearst's strength as to shift the<br />\nNational Convention from Chicago,<br />\nwhere he appeared strong. But when<br />\nthe Convention actually assembled in<br />\nSt. Louis, Hearst had unimpressive<br />\nsupport. There were objections that<br />\nthe Democrats owed a Convention to<br />\nChicago; but after the unpleasantness<br />\nof 1968, it will probably be<br />\nconceded that the Democrats have<br />\nassembled in Chicago once too often.<br />\nBryan himself had kind words for<br />\nHearst, but chose to support Senator<br />\nFrancis Cockrell of Missouri.<br />\nIn Congress the Democrats had<br />\nsome articulate spokesman who were<br />\nat least as well qualified for the<br />\nPresidency as Parker. But the<br />\nDemocratic spokesmen were usually<br />\nSoutherners. They were therefore<br />\nout of consideration for the<br />\nnomination, as their own region was<br />\nexpected to vote Democratic<br />\nregardless of the nominee, and they<br />\nwould have had difficulty generating<br />\nfurther support in the North.<br />\nThus, largely for want of a viable<br />\nalternative, and not lacking in the<br />\noptimism<br />\nwhich<br />\nnormally<br />\ncharm...ten/es National Conventions,<br />\nthe Democrats gave their standard to<br />\nJustice Parker. In my next coluinn I<br />\nshall describe the Justice's surprising<br />\nreaction.<br />\n<br />\nEl<br />\n<br />\n\fOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, SEPT. 12, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nHop Fund Raising: \"A Backhanded Way\"<br />\nDue to a governmental reluctance to<br />\nppropriate funds for non-educational buildings,<br />\nlopkins<br />\nthat the new<br />\nhas claimed<br />\ndministration building going up south of<br />\n._.evering Hall will serve to release classroom and<br />\nesearch laboratory space from administrative<br />\nse.<br />\nIn speaking of the tactics employed by the University<br />\nn securing $585,000 in federal funds for the<br />\nonstruction of Garland Hall, Michael McGrail, Director<br />\nf Public Relations, stated, \"This is giving us an excuse<br />\nor the building. . .

The troubled dreams of an<br />\noverworked student slumped over his typewriter at four<br />\nin the morning? Neither. Just such a system was termed<br />\n\"inevitable\" in the first of a series of lectures entitled<br />\n\"Computers, Communication, and the Public Interest,\"<br />\nto be delivered this year at the Hopkins School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies in Washington.<br />\nThe computerized library will be made possible by<br />\nthe development of large scale time-sharing computer<br />\nsystems, according to Dr. John Kemeny, Albert Gradley<br />\nThird Century Professor at Dartmouth College, who<br />\n<br />\ndelivered the talk yesterday.<br />\nA large time-sharing computer system would allow as<br />\nmany as 2000 users to communicate via teletype with<br />\none or more large high speed digital computers<br />\nsimultaneously. The machine switches back and forth<br />\nbetween the various users so rapidly that each one has<br />\nthe illusion that he has the computer all to himself. The<br />\nservice could cost as little as two dollars an hour.<br />\nTime Sharing Advantages<br />\nThe great advantage of computer time-sharing is that<br />\nit allows the user to hold \"conversations\" with the<br />\ncomputer. Instead of waiting hours for the results to<br />\ncome back from the computing center, answers to<br />\nquestions or other information are received within<br />\nseconds.<br />\nThe rapidly diminishing cost of time-sharing facilities<br />\nwill permit a \"computer in every home,\" Dr. Kemeny<br />\nexplained. The harried housewife will be able to do<br />\ncomparative shopping from a terminal in her own<br />\nkitchen, and aspiring but inexperienced quarterbacks<br />\nwill be able to play totally realistic football games<br />\nagainst an opponent anywhere in the world, with the<br />\ncomputer acting as football, field, and referee.<br />\nMan on the Street<br />\nThe possiblities for using computers to improve man's<br />\nexistence are vast. According to Dr. Kemeny, a large<br />\ntime-sharing system could handle the registration of jobs<br />\nand match employee criteria against existing openings.<br />\nOther systems could have similar uses in housing, law<br />\nenforcement, traffic control, education, and medical<br />\ndiagnosis. While computers have done much to improve<br />\nefficiency and reduce cost, \"little or no effort has been<br />\nexpended to try to think up new services, made possible<br />\nby the high speed computer, to make life better for most<br />\nof us. This may be one of the significant reasons why the<br />\nman on the street feels resentment towards computers.\"<br />\nComputers may make possible the mass restructuring<br />\nof our civilization, by facilitating the decentralization of<br />\nour way of life. If business can be conducted by means<br />\nof computers - - allowing instant communication and<br />\ndata recording and retrieving on a world-wide<br />\n<br />\nbasis - - modern man will not have to infest large urb<br />\nsprawls, now the breeding ground for most social ills.<br />\nIn order to accomplish the use of large time-sharii<br />\nsystems on a national scale, Dr. Kemeny makes thr<br />\nrecommendations concerning national policy towar<br />\nthe computer. First, better methods of forecasti<br />\ncomputer use must be developed to allow ti<br />\ncommunications industry to keep pace with increasi<br />\ndemands. Second, the budget of the National Scien<br />\nFoundation should be increased by 100 million dolla<br />\nto fund the support of computer education. \"I predict<br />\nsays Dr. Kemeny, \"that within a decade the fede<br />\ngovernment will find this one of its most profitat<br />\ninvestments in terms of the vast expansion of t<br />\neconomy and the resulting revenue for the Feder<br />\nGovernment.\"<br />\nFinally, because the research and developme<br />\nneeded to establish such a large scale system are beyo'<br />\nthe means of any local or state government and may r<br />\nbe profitable enough to attract the attention<br />\ncommercial companies, Dr. Kemeny calls for t<br />\ncreation of a National Computer Development Aga<br />\n(NCDA) which would have as its mandate<br />\ndevelopment of systems needed to impleme<br />\ntime-sharing systems on a large scale.<br />\nSeminar Series<br />\nThe seminars, the first of which featured<br />\nKemeny, are held in the auditorium of the Jo<br />\nHopkins University School of Advanced Internatio<br />\nStudies, 1740 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Wash ingt<br />\nD.C. on the second Thursday of each month thro<br />\nApril, 1970.

Gwen<br />\nPatton, a leader of the National<br />\nAssociation of Black Students NABS<br />\nexplained that the money would be<br />\nused for recruitment, scholarships and<br />\nBlack study programs.<br />\nNABS asserted that for the past eight<br />\nyears Blacks had advised the NSA on<br />\nhow to appropriate money but that the<br />\nadvice had received only cursory notice.<br />\nThey claimed that previous programs<br />\nhad been initiated and run with White<br />\nsupervision. NABS proposed that the<br />\ntwo organizations \"operate separately<br />\non each group's priorities and\" ...<br />\ncoalesce on those issues which are<br />\nrelevant to the two groups and other<br />\ngroups so that constructive changes may<br />\nbe brought about for the society.<br />\nA Cry for Reform<br />\nThe NABS statement also<br />\nencouraged the NSA to \"stop slacking<br />\nup by trying to find the easiest<br />\nalternative of not dealing with their<br />\nproblems,\" and rather to gove'ttudents<br />\na direction in which to move. The Black<br />\nexpressed hope that white members<br />\nwould attempt to deal with problems<br />\nsuch as \"institutionalized racism,<br />\nrepressive police actions and measures,<br />\nand irrelevant education.\"<br />\nThe JNSA adopted Black student<br />\nproposals and then proceeded to elect<br />\nnew officers. Charles Palmer, former<br />\npresident of the student body at the<br />\nUniversity of California at Berkeley,<br />\nwon the presidential election for the<br />\ncorning,year<br />\n<br />\nAside from election of officers and<br />\nestablishing policy the NSA held daily<br />\nworkshops on topics relevant to the<br />\nuniversity environment.

This is in my<br />\nopinion, the singularly most important<br />\nproblem facing students at Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe workshop proposed new<br />\ndirections for undergraduate education.<br />\nIt was generally agreed at the meeting<br />\nthat an undergraduate education should<br />\nbe unique from a graduate level<br />\neducation. The group felt that a college<br />\neducation must be oriented toward the<br />\ndevelopment of life styles and<br />\nphilosophies rather than solely the<br />\nacquisition of vocational skills.<br />\nIn the discussions, the question of<br />\nthe possible effects of eliminating grades<br />\non graduate school admission, student<br />\nevaluation of faculty performance, and<br />\nexperimental colleges were discussed.<br />\n\"The Drug Study seminars<br />\nestablished helpful contacts with NSA<br />\nDrug Study Center in Washington, D.

By Monday<br />\nafternoon I'd been frustrated by<br />\na futile encounter with the<br />\nGilman Hall bureaucracy. If this<br />\nsounds more typical to<br />\n<br />\nupperclassmen, let it be a note<br />\nof Welcome to freshmen.<br />\nMy plight may seem<br />\nsuperficial in the light of the<br />\nastounding changes which have<br />\noccurred on university campuses<br />\nin recent years. It involves<br />\nHopkins' marvelously wideranging Pass/Fail system. As I<br />\nunderstand it, a course not<br />\nincluded in the required<br />\ncurriculum of a student<br />\nattempting to obtain a<br />\ndepartmental major may be<br />\ntaken on the P/f basis. On<br />\nMonday I resolved, being an<br />\nInternational Relations major, to<br />\nfulfill part of my N,Q, or E<br />\nrequirement with a course taken<br />\nP/F. I went to the Registrar's<br />\nOffice and was redirected to Dr.<br />\nDierman's office in Gilman 238.<br />\nHis secretary, renowned for her<br />\ncurt efficiency, told me that I<br />\nwas too late to sign up for the<br />\nP/F option, that Dr. Dierman<br />\nhad extended the deadline to<br />\nnoon, and that I should stop<br />\nbothering her. I insisted that I<br />\nshould speak to Dr. Dierman and<br />\nwas smugly accomodated.<br />\nDierman's approach verged<br />\n<br />\non the ridiculous. After telling<br />\nhim what I wanted to do, \"lie<br />\ntold me that I was too late.<br />\nSince I wanted to avoid trouble<br />\nbut still be informed, I suggested<br />\nthat he tell me why I had to<br />\nregister P/F at any special time.<br />\nHe was unable to do so. I<br />\nguessed an answer which would<br />\nhave satisfied me, but he refused<br />\nto make it easy for himself.<br />\nNo \u2014 the administrative cost of<br />\nhaving a secretary write one's<br />\nname down on a P/F list is not<br />\ntoo great. He blissfully informed<br />\nme that I hadn't paid enough<br />\nattention to the addenda to our<br />\nantiquated catalog. I repreated<br />\nmy stance: I wasn't getting an A<br />\ngrade in a course for which I'd<br />\nsigned up P/F \u2014 I only wanted<br />\nto take this particular<br />\nnon-departmental course on a<br />\nP/F basis to relieve some of the<br />\nacademic pressure which<br />\nHopkins proudly offers, like a<br />\nsix-year-old displaying the first<br />\ngap in his baby teeth. After all,<br />\nto relieve what may be harmful<br />\nto intellectual development-grade grubbing-is the purpose of<br />\na P/F course.

Sydnor brings a strong desire and<br />\nsound ideas to this newly created post at Homewood. From his<br />\noffice in the gym he is responsible for getting the sports news to the<br />\nnewspapers and other news media.<br />\nSydnor graduated from Loyola High School in 1957 and attended<br />\nfor one year. He then moved on to Loyola where he graduated<br />\nin 1962 as a<br />\nhistory major. While attending our Charles Street rival,<br />\nhe lettered three timesin swimming. As his sports interest grew, he<br />\nalso managed lacrosse and track.<br />\nGraduated ROTC<br />\nUpon graduation, Jim received a commission as a second<br />\nlieutenant through the Army ROTC Rogram. He spent the next five<br />\nYears as an army infantry officer.<br />\nFrom basic infantry training at Fort Benning he moved on to<br />\nKorea. Upon his return to the U.S., he was stationed at Fort<br />\nLeonard Wood. where he became athletic director and editor of the<br />\ncamp newspaper. From Fort Wood he left for Panama in an airborne<br />\nunit.<br />\nFollowing seven months of training he went to Viet Nam with the<br />\nThird Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division, where he received the<br />\nBronze Star for meritorious service as anintelligence officer.<br />\nWorked for News-American<br />\nAfter his discharge he returned to Baltimore and was the Prep<br />\nSjorts Reporter for Young World Magazine at the<br />\nNews-American. Sydnor hopes to project<br />\nthe image of Hopkins as<br />\na place where we<br />\n\"do things.\" Sports, he feels, offers the university<br />\nan excellent chance<br />\nto relate to undergraduates, alumni, and<br />\nthepublic. This is an opportunity which the university can use.<br />\nSydnor feels athletic competition offers an invaluable training<br />\nPlace where the individual can test his courage. To use one of his<br />\nc'wn metaphors, the university often appears as a streamlined train<br />\nsPee.ding faster and faster towards one goal, that of scholarly<br />\nachievement.<br />\nAs passengers on this train we owe it to ourselves to<br />\nnot allow this train to become our prison.<br />\nAthletics offers an excellent addition to our learning experience<br />\nat Hopkins. The<br />\nfall starts a new career for both Jim Sydnor and the<br />\nfreshman.<br />\nWe wish them both the best of luck.

The governing boards<br />\ndecision also provides that if a student is caught and<br />\nconvicted by the courts on a drug rap, he will be<br />\nautomatically suspended from school. The acting<br />\nchairman. of the governing board Said last week that the<br />\nnew drug rules were part of a drug control program<br />\nstarted last year.<br />\nA spokesman for the Student Affairs Committee<br />\nannounced that a survey made this summer of incoming<br />\nfreshman showed that of the 1500 students, 35% said<br />\nthey had used drugs at least once and another 15%<br />\nclaimed that although they had not yet used drugs, they<br />\nplanned to try them.<br />\nEvans Strager, the vice pr sident of the student<br />\ngovernment, stated that the new rules would be<br />\nineffective as a drug deterrent on campus.

A one-year lease and the erection of<br />\ntwo staff buildings cost $100,000, excluding the<br />\n$70,000 that the General Services Administration spent<br />\non partitions and furnishings. The Government<br />\npersonnel was housed in a motel, occupying between<br />\n100 and 120 rooms each night of Nixon's stay. At the<br />\nspecial rate of eight dollars a day, the owner was about<br />\n$36,000 richer at the end of the summer.<br />\nAmong the costs not available for one reason or<br />\nanother are, those of the communication systems and the<br />\ncost of flying both personnel and people on business to<br />\nthe President in and out of the state. According to the<br />\nPresident's press secretary, \"If we said what<br />\ncommunications cost, then someone could figure out<br />\nwhat our communication capability is from that dollar<br />\nfigure.\"<br />\nOn Nixon's \"Making Life Bearable\" list were Air<br />\nForce One, private courier planes, ten black limousines<br />\ndriven from Washington at the cost of $9,000, a fleet of<br />\nnine electric golf carts and several bicycles.

This is to compensate for those<br />\napplicants who are accepted at more than one<br />\nschool and must reject those they decide not to<br />\nattend. Mr. Brinley pointed out that Hopkins<br />\nusually receives about twenty-five of these<br />\nrejections over the summer. Although no one<br />\nknows why, only five were received this year<br />\nresulting in an unsually large freshman class.<br />\nThe make-up of the class is similar to those of<br />\nprevious years.

This year's 54<br />\nhumanities majors were chosen from only 200<br />\napplicants while the 234 natural science majors<br />\ncame from over 1400 applications.

HOELSCHER<br />\nNews Director<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, the President of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Russell<br />\nA. Nelson, stated that moves towards<br />\nunionization of the non-professional<br />\nHospital employees \"is not in the best<br />\ninterests of the public, patients<br />\nor ...employees\" and may lead to a<br />\n$20-a-day increase in present hospital<br />\nrates. Last week Local 1199E of the<br />\nHospital and Nursing Home Employees<br />\nUnion won the right to represent<br />\nHospital employees in<br />\nLabor/management negotiations.<br />\nThe immediate effect of the<br />\nunionization of the Hospital will<br />\nremain unclear until the negotiations<br />\nbetween union and Hospital officials<br />\nhave been completed. Nevertheless,<br />\nNelson did indicate significant<br />\nmisgivings over the union's success.<br />\nIn a letter to all hospital employees<br />\nDr. Nelson states that\"by winning the<br />\nright to represent these<br />\nemployees ... the union has assumed<br />\ntremendous responsibilities.<br />\n\"During the campaign the union<br />\nmade many promises that concern us<br />\nand concern us now.\" He said that it is<br />\n\"greatly difficult, if not impossible\" for<br />\nthe hospital to meet these promises.<br />\nPrimary concern of the hospital<br />\nadministration rests with the union's<br />\ndemand for $100 minimum weekly<br />\nsalary ($2.50 per hour). At present, the<br />\nminimum wage at the hospital is $1.80<br />\nper hour, 35 cents above the<br />\nFederalminimum wage for hospital<br />\nworkers.<br />\nNecessary Updating<br />\nNelson admitted that the present<br />\nminimum level at Hopkins is low, but<br /><br />\nnoted that the hospital has committed<br />\nitself to raising that wage. He did not<br />\nspecify the amount of the proposed<br />\nincrease or when such a re-evaluation<br />\nwould by conducted, however.<br />\nPaul J. Van Nevel, chief public<br />\nrelations officer for Hopkins, also<br />\nwarned against the sudden cost increase<br />\nresulting from the demands. It would lie<br />\nargues, lead \"to a ripple effect resulting<br />\nin a raise that could not be borne by the<br />\nhospital, while affecting many other<br />\nsegments of society.\"<br />\n\"The hospital's reaction,\" countered<br />\nFred Punch, chief organizer of 1199E,<br />\n\"is typical of any other profiteer.<br />\nRather than reduce profits he would<br />\nvisit the added expense on those who<br />\ncan least afford it - - the patients.\"<br />\nOther union demands include an end<br />\nto forced retirement, free life insurance,<br />\nfree hospitalization and respect for<br />\nseniority.<br />\nNelson stated that despite past<br />\ndifficulties, he hoped \"differences can<br />\nbe resolved in fair bargaining between<br />\nunion and hospital representatives. We<br />\nhope, too, that the union will place the<br />\npublic interest predominently among its<br />\nobjectives, as the hospital does.\"<br />\nPunch echoed Nelson's statement:<br />\n\"Our issues are firm but we will enter all<br />\nnegotiations in the true spirit of<br />\ncollective bargaining.\"<br />\nWhen asked about union policy for<br />\nthe future, Punch replied, however,\"We<br />\ncannot negotiate on the media, our<br />\nposition is clear.\"<br />\nThe major portion of Local 1199E's<br />\ncampaign for unionization of all<br />\nnon-professional hospital employees<br />\nbegan over the summer months.

The failure of the<br />\nNational Organizing Committee to<br />\nachieve these goals in Charleston, South<br />\nCarolina prompted a 113 day hospital<br />\nstrike in that city.<br />\nThe highlight of the union's drive<br />\nhere came on August 27 when Mrs.<br />\nCoretta Scott King, widow of the Rev.<br />\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., spent over<br /><br />\n90 minutes at Hopkins.<br />\nHundreds of Negro workers filed out<br />\nof the hospital to shake Mrs. King's<br />\nhand and to hear speeches by union<br />\nofficials.<br />\nMrs. King, honorary chairman of the<br />\nNOC, said that the Baltimore campaign<br />\nrepresented \"an expression of the<br />\nwinning combination forged in<br />\nCharleston by the Southern Christian<br />\nLeadership Conference and Local<br />\n1199.\"<br />\n\"It's a combination of soul power<br />\nand union power,\" she said.<br /><br />\nJHU Fights Non-Ivy Image<br />\nIn an attempt to reverse the position<br />\nof Hopkins as a second choice school<br />\nfor those who were rejected by the Ivy<br />\nLeague, the - Homewood Admissions<br />\nOffice has announced a widespread<br />\nreorganization of its alumni associations<br />\ninvolved in recruitment.<br />\nAlthough local Hopkins Alumni<br />\nAssociations have been assisting in the<br />\nundergraduate recruiting process for the<br />\npast fifteen years, they have been acting<br />\nas isolated groups with no national<br />\nco-ordination. The new National<br />\nAlumni Schools Committee,-headed by<br />\nthe Hon. Robert I. H. Hammerman of<br />\nBaltimore's Supreme Bench, will serve<br />\nas an overseeing and co-ordinating body.<br />\nThe overall objectives of the Committee<br />\nwill be to \"organize Johns Hopkins<br />\nalumni in each state in the nation,\" he<br />\nsaid, and Special emphasis will be placed<br />\non regions like the far west, where the<br />\nUniversity generally attracts fewer<br />\napplicants.<br />\nThe Committee will be aided by<br />\nAssistant Director of Admissions<br />\nMichael Anderson, who will help with<br />\nthe organization as well as providing the<br />\nlocal committees with access to the<br />\nnecessary Admissions Office reports and<br />\nrecords. Mr. Anderson noted a number<br />\nof reasons for the reorganization.<br />\nPrimarily the University wants to<br />\nmaintain its national prestige by<br />\ncontinuing to draw students from all<br />\nparts of the country. Mr. Anderson<br />\nexpressed the long term goal as \"having<br />\nevery school in the country\" available<br />\nto the Committee. Short term plans are<br />\nto cover \"every major city and every<br />\nstate.\"<br />\nYouthful Image<br />\nThe need for Alumni assistance arises<br />\nfrom the inability of the small<br />\nAdmissions Office staff to adequately<br />\ncover all the possible applicants. The<br />\nintense competion from other schools<br />\nmakes it necessary to search out talent<br />\nwherever it appears, explained<br />\nAnderson. The Alumni Committee will<br />\nact in this area, seeking out qualified<br />\nstudents and.generating applications to.<br /><br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe national organization will<br />\nappoint a chairman for each local group.<br />\nThese will then choose their own local<br />\ncommittees. Although there are no<br />\nstrict requirements, the general<br />\nguidelines suggest that a prospective<br />\ncounselor be a Homewood graduate<br />\nwith a bachelor's degree. Recent<br />\ngraduates are particularly sought by the<br />\ncommittee in hopes that \"their young<br />\nimage will enable the applicants to<br />\nbetter identify with them.<br />\nIn another area of the recruiting<br />\nprocess. the Undergraduate Admissions<br />\nCouncil has received the support of the<br />\nAdmissions Office for its plans to help<br />\ncounsel prospective applicants. The<br />\nCouncil was formed last year to allow<br />\nHomewood undergraduates to contact<br />\ninterested high school students, in an<br />\nattempt to give them a fuller picture of<br />\nuniversity life. Plans will be announced<br />\nlater this year for the selection of<br />\nCouncil Aides who will meet with the<br />\nprospects in their home towns over the<br />\nChristmas recess.<br />\nNo Status<br />\nThe Admissions Council was created<br />\nlast fall by the Student Council. At that<br />\ntime the plan called for the Council to<br />\noperate as an official part of the Office<br />\nof Admissions.<br />\nThe Admissions Office, however, will<br />\ngrant the Council neither official nor<br />\nsemi-official status (they must operate,<br />\nstated Anderson, as \"interested<br />\nindividuals\"). Yet the Office has<br />\nwelcomed their support and will in fact<br />\nask them to contact a number of the<br />\nUniversity's prime prospects.<br />\nAccording to Assistant Director<br />\nAnderson, the lack of status is a matter<br />\nof \"ethics and confidentiality.\" High<br />\nand prep school guidance councelors are<br />\nextremely sensitive in the area of<br />\nextending confidential information to<br />\nnon-staff members. Thus while<br />\nundergraduates are in an excellent<br />\nposition to help with recruiting, the<br />\njudgement functions must be left to<br />\nqualified staff members.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n, OMEWOOD BM_ TimORE SEPT. 12 1969<br /><br />\nGraf Extols LSD<br />\nAs Therapy Aid<br /><br />\ndammerman Raps<br />\nDated Drug Laws<br />\n\"Don't get caught,\" was Judge Robert<br />\nHammerman's advice to freshmen at the drug<br />\nseminar held at Turner Hall last Friday as part of<br />\nFreshman orientation.<br />\nHammerman, who sits on the Supreme Bench<br />\nof. Baltimore City, attacked our drug laws as<br />\nbeing \"archaic, inconsistent, and unrealistic.\" He<br />\nnoted, however, that \"Hopkins is not a<br />\n.sa nctuary and students are subject to all the<br />\ninequalities of the law.\"<br />\nThese were the same points emphasized by Judge<br />\nHammerman when he spoke at the<br />\ntudent-faculty meeting immediately after the dormitory<br />\nrug bust of last spring. The midnight bust resulted<br />\n11 the arrest of three freshmen for possession of<br />\nnarcotics. Two were charged with possession of<br />\namphetamines; one with possession of marijuana.<br />\nBust Followed by Sit-In<br />\nThe bust was immediately followed by a massive four<br />\na.m. sit-in on President Gordon's lawn. The University<br />\nacted quickly to make sure that none of the individuals'<br />\nrights had been violated. The three students were<br />\nindicted, but during the summer the state's attorney<br />\ndropped all charges against them.<br />\nMaryland law, explained judge Hammerman, classifies<br />\nillegal drugs' as either narcotic or dangerous. Heroin,<br />\nmorphine, cocaine, opium, and mairjuana are all.<br />\nClassified as narcotics. Thus possession and use of these<br />\ndrugs are felonies punishable by fines up to $1000 and<br />\nimprisonment up to five years. LSD, mescaline,<br />\namphetamines, and barbituates are classed as dangerous<br />\ndrugs. Possession of these drugs is a misdemeanor<br />\nPunishable by fines up to $500 and imprisonment up to<br />\nOne year. The penalty for use of LSD is a fine of up to<br />\n$100. \"If someone approaches you who looks like<br />\nthe<br />\nfuzz swallow the stuff,\" counselled Judge<br />\nHammerman.<br /><br />\n\"If someone approaches you who looks like the fuzz, swallow<br />\nthe stuf advice from Jud e Robert Hammerman.<br /><br />\nArrests Up 1,860%<br />\nF.B.I. statistics indicate that the number of young<br />\nPeople arrested for drugs was 1,860%'higher in 1968<br />\nthan in 1960. \"The rise is due primarily to marijuana<br />\narrests,\" said Judge Hammerman.<br />\n\"The laws have not been modernized because<br />\npoliticians take their impressions from where the votes<br />\nare. There is a mood in the country today of repression<br />\nagainst young people.\"<br />\nWhat happens when a person is arrested for<br />\nmarijuana, noted the judge, is purely a matter of chance.'<br />\nGreat discretionary power is given to the judge. Some.<br />\nudges will not give young people records.<br />\n\"Most Judges Conservative\"<br />\nBut Judge Hammerman added that \"judges for the<br />\nMost part are conservative. Several kids from nice homes<br />\nin Baltimore County have been sent to prison for five<br />\nYears for using marijuana. Many judges feel they must<br />\nmake examples of those arrested.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 3<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nAccording to Dr. Stanislav Graf,\"What is sensational about LSD<br />\nis the incredible potency of minute doses.\"<br /><br />\nBy DAVID MELAMED<br />\nWhen LSD is used under controlled<br />\nconditions, Dr. Stanislav Graf told the freshman<br />\nclass, it can lead to religious experience, artistic<br />\ncreation, and an unfolding of the collective<br />\nunconscious.<br />\nSpeaking before a drug seminar held at Turner Hall<br />\nlast Friday, Dr. Graf outlined the history, nature, and<br />\ntherapeutic uses of LSD, which he termed \"the most<br />\npowerful tool of modern psychology.\" Dr. Graf,<br />\nAssistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of<br />\nMaryland, has worked with hallucinogenic drugs for 12<br />\nyears, and has taken LSD himself.<br />\nDr. Graf described LSD as \"an unspecific amplifier<br />\nwhich brings out and intensifies what is in the psyche<br />\nalready. There are no symptoms which always occur in<br />\nLSD sessions.\" Thus, he asserted, few of the bad things<br />\nsaid about LSD relate to LSD itself.<br />\nRather, Dr. Graf explained, the bad things relate to<br />\nthe context in which LSD is taken. When LSD is taken<br />\nunder uncontrolled conditions, several factors can create<br />\na serious risk. The user is uncertain about the<br />\npharmaceutalogical content of his dose, paranoid about<br />\nthe possibility of being arrested, and may feel guilty<br />\nabout taking LSD in the first place.<br />\nA great sensation in the scientific world was caused<br />\nwhen LSD was first introduced for therapeutic purposes<br />\nin the 1950's. Dr. Graf delineated two therapeutic<br />\nmethods of utilitzing LSD, and showed several paintings<br />\ndrawn by his patients during periods of deep ecstasy and<br />\nagony, to illustrate states of mind attained through LSD<br />\nuse.<br />\nIn the \"psychedelic method,\" sessions are structured<br />\nso the subject will receive a deep mystical experience.<br />\nBefore the session a doctor goes through the patient's<br />\nhistory in order to give the patient some idea of how his<br />\nsymptoms are related to his problems. The psychedelic<br />\nmethod is most commonly used with alcoholics to aid<br />\nthem in developing will power. It is also used to help<br />\nterminal cancer patients reconcile themselves with death.<br />\nDr. Graf described the \"psycholytic method\" as an<br />\n\"intensification of psychoanalysis\" where LSD aids the<br />\npatient in transcending himself in -order to understand<br />\nand deal with his problems. As in psychoanalysis, the<br />\nanalyst attempts to enter into the patient's world. ,<br />\nDr. Graf stressed that drugs have existed in nearly all<br />\ncultures throughout the ages. Hashish has been widely<br />\nused throughout the Orient. In Mexico, the home<br />\ncountry of hallucinogenics, peyote, morning - glory seeds<br />\nand sacred mushrooms have been widely used. \"What is<br />\nsensational about LSD,\" stated Dr. Graf, \"is the<br />\nincredible potency of minute closets.\"<br />\nDr. Graf suggested that the long term result of<br />\nmarijuana use is \"very similar to what you see with<br />\nrepeated use of LSD. People start losing their drive for<br />\nachievement and begin to place much more emphasis on<br />\njoy, pleasure, and doing things for their own sake.\"<br />\nLSD was first discovered in Switzerland thirty years<br />\nago during gynecological research. At this time it was<br />\nclassified as an uninteresting drug not meriting further<br />\nresearch. Five years late, during an experiment in<br />\nSwitzerland designed to find a cure for migrain<br />\nheadaches, Dr. Hoffman of the Sandos Laboratory<br />\nexperienced accidental intoxication from LSD. Hoffman<br />\nlater discovered the cause of his experiences and<br />\nintroduced LSD to the scientific world.<br /><br />\nPossibility Arises for Changes in Med School<br />\nThere has been no formal approval of<br />\nthe Committee's recommendations, still<br />\nIn the next few weeks, students and<br />\ntermed \"preliminary\" ny the<br />\nunior faculty members may fill<br />\nadministration officials. \"There<br />\nI ewly-created seats alongside<br />\nprobably won't be any specific date set,<br />\ndministrators of the Hopkins Medical<br />\n\"explained Dr. Handelsman. \"Some of<br />\n;chool in an attempt to simplify and<br />\nthe proposals will be implemented<br />\n'democratize\" the governing structure<br />\nrapidly, some slowly, and some not at<br />\nIf the 100-year-old institution.<br />\nall.\"<br />\nThe plan, however, can still be<br />\nThe most drastic, and controversial,<br />\nclapped if the senior members of the<br />\nrecommendation by the Governance<br />\nwithdraw their tentative support<br />\nCommittee would create a Medical<br />\nOr the 30 proposals recently submitted<br />\nur<br />\nCouncil composed of elected faculty<br />\n'3 the faculty by the ad hoc Committee<br />\nmembers and students from the medical<br />\nGovernance.

Thus,<br />\nthe a ppl i cation of behavioral<br />\nsanctions to its students is inherently<br />\na distasteful process which in the<br />\nideal condition woul not be<br />\nnecessary. But no community,<br />\nuniversity or other institution exists<br />\nin the ideal condition. Traditional<br />\ndependence on self-discipline by<br />\nmembers of the academic<br />\ncommunity does not in fact always<br />\nprevent actions prejudicial to a<br />\nuniversity's best interests. Every<br />\nuniversity is therefore compelled to<br />\nseek policies and procedures that<br />\ninsure its integrity as a social<br />\ninstitution. In doing so, however, it<br />\nmust be mindful of the interests and<br />\nrights of its members, for its<br />\ninstitutional posture must not betray<br />\nits humane tradition.<br />\nTo attempt to define rules of<br />\nconduct in terms of specific forms of<br />\nmisconduct, is to risk omissions and<br />\nto provoke a series of after-the-fact<br />\namendments that weaken the force<br />\nof the original policy statement.<br />\nRather, it is preferable that such<br />\nrules be stated in terms of the general<br />\ncharacteristics that identify such<br />\nclasses of behavior, and that fair<br />\nprocedural arrangements provide for<br />\nthe broad classes of behavior which<br />\nmay be subject to appropriate<br />\nsanctions:<br />\nI. conduct that abridges the rights<br />\nand interests of others, especially as<br />\nit affects their educational goals<br />\nwithin the University or threatens<br />\ntheir safety. health, welfare or<br />\nproperty.<br />\n2. conduct that disrupts the normal<br />\nfunctioning of the University or that<br />\ndamages physical facilities of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n3. conduct that significantly impairs<br />\nthe effective relationship of the<br />\nUniversity to the larger community<br />\nof which it is a part.<br />\nThe University will not intrude<br />\nitself into the personal lives of its<br />\nstudents nor will it add sanctions for<br />\nunlawful behavior already dealt<br />\nwith by civil authority, unless such<br />\nbehavior falls within the classes of<br />\nconduct described above. It is<br />\nunderstood that sanctions are to be<br />\nrationally applied and commensurate<br />\nto the seriousness of the precipitating<br />\nmisconduct. In addition<br />\nconsideration should be given to the<br />\nnature of the appellant's motivation,<br />\nand University sancitons may,<br />\nperhaps, be mitigated in the light of<br />\nthat motivation and the impelling<br />\ncircumstance.<br />\nThe sanctions of definitive (as<br />\ndistinct from interim)suspension or<br />\nexpulsion may be recommended by<br />\nthe chief administrative officer of the<br /><br />\nrecommendations may place students in<br />\ndouble jeopardy.<br />\nThe original committee draft<br />\nrecommended that the University<br />\nsurrender jurisdictional rights when it<br />\nacts as the complainant; urged that civil<br />\noffenses be ignored when the University<br />\nconsiders sanctions against a student<br />\nwhen it is not acting as the complainant;<br />\nand suggested that \"University sanctions<br />\nought not be applied in cases where the<br />\nUniversity has had prior knowledge of<br />\nthe offense and has not exercised its<br />\njurisdiction.<br />\nBetcher noted that Gordon's entire<br />\noperating procedure \"smacks of<br />\ntokenism,\" since the President revised<br />\nthe report of the committee (which he<br />\nhad appointed) after the committee had<br />\ndissolved.<br />\nThe ad hoc committee was composed<br />\nof Dr. William Bevan, University<br />\nProvost; Robert Bilgrave, Director of<br />\nStudent Affairs; Dr. John Mann, Asst.<br />\nProfessor of Education; Dr. J.

This may well be the most important resolution<br />\nwhich the Council will be called upon to consider all year.<br />\nThe idea that students should have something to say about the<br />\neducation they receive at Hopkins has been paid much lip service in<br />\nprevious years. However, the students' voice was always ensconced in<br />\nsome committee, ignored by those who wielded the real power, and not<br />\nheard by those whom the \"representatives\" were supposedly speaking for.<br />\nNow the Student Council as the chance to make genuine headway in the<br />\nfight to make students a part of this university. There can be no<br />\njustification for not taking it.<br />\nThe notion that students can design a course is not revolutionary, even<br />\nm the mildest sense of the word. However, the fact that Hopkins students<br />\nwould be able to design their own course, choose the professor who<br />\nteaches it and get academic credit for it is a tremendous step in the right<br />\ndirection. If the course has some relevance to the lives of students in<br />\n1969, the achievement will be nothing short of miraculous.<br />\nThe resolution and the original idea for its design began with Manuel<br />\nRodriguez. Rodriguez originally planned to present the plan to the Council<br />\nlast Monday. Discussions with professors concerning the best way to<br />\ninsure adoption of the proposal convinced him to postpone its appearance<br />\nuntil this coming Monday. We hope that the professors have not<br />\nconvinced him to water down the resolution as well.<br />\nProblems with implementation of the proposal center around the<br />\nattitude of the Academic Council. If past performance is any indication,<br />\nwe can expect that'many members of the Council (and the faculty at\u2022<br />\nlarge) will be against this attempt to provide a course of the students' own<br />\ndesign. Moreover, the Academic Council might be expected to issue forth<br />\nwith some very fancy verbiage on the nature of the university and who<br />\nshould determine what is taught.<br />\nThe fact is, the idea that the students could design a course for<br />\nacademic credit may prove frightening to some members of the faculty.<br />\nConstrued from any point of view, this resolution represents an attempt<br />\nto assume student responsiblity in an area which was previously the<br /><br />\n1 11AD<br />\nCHWITO c=:)<br />\nso I<br />\nccaP<br />\nFPEE<br />\nOF<br />\n6F,Cea-<br /><br />\nMoekrer?<br />\n(.3Eopc,<br />\nCOMP'<br /><br />\nFReE<br />\nOF MY<br />\nt1/440111ER.<br /><br />\nMT<br />\nFAcK To<br />\n66(RGE<br />\nSo I<br />\nCOULD<br />\n166 REE<br />\nOF Sula:<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nexclusive domain of faculty and administration. And many members of the<br />\nfaculty believe that it ought to remain their exclusive domain. Rodriguez<br />\ndoesn't believe it and neither do we.<br />\nWe look forward to the proposal's appearance before the Student<br />\nCouncil and hope that the Council will react quickly and favorably. In<br />\naddition, we hope that the Council and the student body will not be<br />\ndissuaded from taking this step because of the objections which will<br />\ndoubtless be raised by the more conservative elements of the faculty.<br /><br />\nA Question of Attitude<br />\nIt is unclear how the 50 or so Freshmen who attended last Sunday's<br />\npanel discussion in the Garrett Room reacted to that introductory session;<br />\nfor those of use whose memories of Hopkins took on a rather rosy glow<br />\nover the summer, it was quite a rude re-awakening.<br />\nThat the discussion was bland and relatively uninformative can be<br />\nexcused and attributed to an end-of-the-summer lethargy and the fact that<br />\nthe Freshmen, who made up most of the audience, were inexperienced<br />\nand unable to question the panelists or analyze their statements properly.<br />\nThat the entire discussion was carried on in an air of astonishing<br />\ncondescension is not so easily excused. It is an insult to the students and<br />\npoints up vividly the vast gap between the attitudes of the faculty and the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nThe gap is further widened when one notes that at least two of the four<br />\npanelists - - Professors Wolman and Mann - - are very liberally oriented.<br />\nThe outlook on the faculty as a whole is even bleaker.<br />\nThe most pertinent question of the afternoon - - and the one which<br />\ndrew the least satisfactory responses - - concerned the University's<br />\ncommittee system. It was suggested that perhaps the student-faculty<br />\ncommittees could be restructured so as to include equal numbers of<br />\nstudents and professors. In response, Dr. Swanson stated that he thought<br />\nthe system was working well as it is; Dr. Wolman, though he was \"unable<br />\nexactly to say why,\" did not like the idea; and Dr. Mandelbaum, pointing<br />\nout the necessity of various specialized faculty members on each<br />\ncommittee, condemned the idea of equality \"for equality's sake.\" The last<br />\ncontention ignored the fact that students, too, have specialities and varied<br />\ninterests. All three, while disparaging the contention, maintained that<br />\ndisagreements never broke down along student-faculty lines.<br />\nDr. Mann - - who claimed that since students are in effect asking for a<br />\n'passport' to future jobs, it is up to professors to determine the<br />\ngraduation requirements - - made a good point. However his example<br />\nholds only for a very limited case. Inmost other instances, students do<br />\nhave a claim to legitimate and real rather than illusory involvement in the<br />\npresent and future policies of the University.<br />\nStudent unrest is directly related to faculty and administrative<br />\ncondescension. The phrase \"meaningful discussion\" is not jargon in this<br />\ncase - - it is the only way to insure tranquility on this and other campuses<br />\nacross the nation.<br /><br />\nHo Chi Minh<br />\nHo was above all a nationalist, and it was for nationalism that he<br />\nfought for thirty years. First against the Japanese. Then, the French.<br />\nAnd<br />\nbefore the French had left, the Americans came in.<br />\nHe led formation of the Viet Minh, guided them to victories over<br />\nthe<br />\nJapanese and the French and was ebshrined in the post of i-evoluntionary<br />\nnational hero. President Eisenhower once estimated that if the United<br />\nStates had permitted nation-wide elections in accordance with the<br />\n1954<br />\nGeneva Accords, Ho would have garnered eighty per cent of the vote.<br />\nIt is sad that Ho could not live to see his dream realized - - a<br />\nunited<br />\nViet Nam, free of foreign invaders. But we hope that those who join<br />\nus in<br />\nmourning his death will gain inspiration from his great courage and see<br />\nthat his dream comes true.<br /><br />\n-lox<br />\nA JC{3<br />\nso I<br />\nCOOS<br /><br />\nT RA)OFF<br />\nOTT( THE<br />\nPRE-S(12E0T<br />\nOF THE<br />\nFIRM So<br />\nCoUt,D<br />\nBE F1266<br />\nOF R sp)sieti.1-ry.<br /><br />\nREEE<br />\nCF TtI6<br />\nCI-1(a6k).<br /><br />\nI DivoRcEv<br />\nOEcP.6E<br />\n&amp;WE HIM<br />\nCUSTOPY<br />\nso f<br />\nCour.P 661<br />\nA FRESH<br />\nSTART.<br /><br />\n\"Vat<br />\nNEVER<br />\n6c-r<br />\niWVE<br /><br />\n1,11\u202211.1tels<br />\n.<br />\nfaX40411160.064.1r14\u20224:141\u20221141.4...11..<br /><br />\n.<br />\n$4.1.11\",<br /><br />\n1.111.1.<br /><br />\n.

Their demise<br />\nwas followed by an album called<br />\n\"Goodbye\" \u2014 interesting in some spots but generally<br />\nvery disappointing.<br />\nSo \"Wheels of Fire\", released a year ago this summer,<br />\nwas the last new music that Eric Clapton put out until<br />\nthe Blind Faith album.<br />\nIn an atmosphere of skillful advance publicity and<br />\nreverence for Cream (British rock magazines are still<br />\nasking, \"Who'll fill the gap left by Cream's break-up?\"),<br />\nBlind Faith with Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Steve<br />\nWinwood in the same band, was eagerly anticipated as<br />\nthe first of the supergroups.<br />\nBut alas, friends, a supergroup in name only. First<br />\ncame their disappointing premier performance in Hyde<br />\nPark in London, then the fiasco of their American<br />\nconcert tour. So everyone waited for the record. They<br />\ngotta be better on record. To make the situation worse,<br />\nthe album release date was 'postponed from June 22<br />\nuntil the beginning of August. ATCO Records should<br />\nhave postponed it indefinitely.<br />\nRacked Voice<br />\nMy dissatisfaction with the Blind Faith album is<br />\ncaused mainly by the ubiquitous presence of Steve<br />\nWinwood. He must be credited with \"Can't Find My<br />\nWay Home\", the best song on the album, but his other<br />\ntunes, \"Had to Cry Today\" and \"Sea of Joy\", are<br />\nreminiscent of his late songs for Traffic: long,<br />\nuneventful, and soporific.<br />\nWindood's singing also causes problems. Many people<br />\ncan tolerate/enjoy his thin high-pitched vocals, in which<br />\nit seems he stretches his voice to the breaking point. I<br />\ncan't. And in the Hyde Park concert Winwood's voice<br /><br />\ncracked so often that the situation soon passed from<br />\nembarrasing to annoying. Definitely not a Jack Bruce.<br />\nSome of the blame for this uninteresting album must<br />\nbe placed on the other musicians. Ginger Baker<br />\ncontinues to bang and thrash away, straining under the<br />\nbelief that he has not yet impressed upon us his celerity<br />\nand agility. Okay Ginger, we're impressed. And the<br />\npuerile lyrics to his interminable song (which isn't even a<br />\nsong) need not be criticized here.<br />\nRoutine Playing<br />\nClapton is the saddest tragedy of the album. His<br />\nacoustic fingering on \"Can't Find My Way Home\" is<br />\nexcellent, as is his solo in \"Presence of the Lord,\" an<br />\ninstrumental that slides from violence to tranquility and<br />\nhas almost no connection with the rest of the song. An<br />\nexplanation for this disjunction can perhaps be found in<br />\nthe song's lyrics (by Clapton), but this seems to be<br />\natrributing more mental resourcefulness to Clapton than<br />\nhe has otherwise demonstrated. The remainder of his<br />\nplaying is very unexciting and routine, with no<br />\nadvancement at all in the last year. He has yet to surpass<br />\nsome of his solos on \"Fresh Cream,\", an album now<br />\nthree years old.<br />\nAnd as for Rick Grech. His bass solo in \"Do What<br />\nYou Like\" is perhaps the most unimaginative and boring<br />\npiece of music to be published anywhere in a long time.<br />\nAgain, he is definitely not a Jack Bruce.<br />\nIf you were disappointed with the Blind Faith album,<br />\nat least you knew who were going to perform the songs.<br />\nNot so in the case of \"Truly Fine Citizen,\" the latest<br />\nrelease by Moby Grape, a once great San Francisco<br />\ngroup whose record \"Wow\" still ranks as a marvelous<br />\nand enjoyable head album. The back jacket of \"Truly<br />\nFine Citizen\" consists of individual photographs of the<br />\nfour members of the band, three of them easily<br /><br />\nrecognizable and the fourth with his back to the viewer,<br />\nanonymous.<br />\nOnly upon opening the record and listening to it (i.e.<br />\nafter putting down the shekels) do we discover the<br />\ndeception we have fallen victim to. Bob Mosley, a<br />\ncompetent song-writer and the Grape's bassist and lead<br />\nvocalist, has gone away, to be inadequately replaced by<br />\nthe mystery man on the back of the cover.<br />\nSo what are we left with? A mediocre album of<br />\ncountry-rock on which one song is indistinguishable<br />\nfrom the next (mystery man wrote most of the songs.)<br />\nSome 44 executives at Columbia Records are laughing at<br />\nhow simple it is to bilk ignorant record buyers. Caveat<br />\nemptor etc. etc.<br />\nNo Cello<br />\nThe magazines may as well continue searching tor a<br />\nreplacement for Cream; the vacuum is still a vacuum.<br />\nMoby Grape has traded talent and honesty for an<br />\nunidentified bgiF player. The scene looks bad, but not<br />\ndesolate. Jack Bruce has an album,\"Songs for a Tailor\",<br />\nto be released in November. It is supposed to be jazz,<br />\nwith no cello playing. And he is preparing another<br />\nrecord with guitarist Larry Coryell. Then there is the<br />\nvery talented anthology of Crosby, Stills, Nash and<br />\nYoung.<br />\nEven more promising is Jethro Tull, an English group<br />\nwhose second album, \"Stand Up\", is a definite<br />\nimprovement over the first. Ian Anderson's flute work is<br />\nmore restrained, melodic and enjoyable on the second;<br />\nhis vocals are smoother. Guitar player Mick Abrahams<br />\nhas left to form Bloodwyn Pig, a blues band. His<br />\nreplacement, a gentleman with the doubtful name of<br />\nMartin Lancelot Barre, is competent. But Anderson<br />\nmakes Jethro Tull and \"Stand Up\" a successful one-mat<br />\nshow.<br /><br />\nono<br />\nf<br />\nor<br />\nnor<br /><br />\nuliV1Z1<br /><br />\n;h<br />\nit tal<br /><br />\n!<br />\n&gt;ii<br /><br />\n::<br /><br />\nrhE<br /><br />\nes<br />\na<br /><br />\nup<br />\nTs<br /><br />\nNe(<br /><br />\n'un<br /><br />\n'<br />\nl 11na<br />\n11(<br /><br />\n1<br />\nbo<br /><br />\nrc<br /><br />\nOur American Heritage<br /><br />\nCleveland's Out; Let's Push Parker<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nOne of the most perplexing facts<br />\nof American history is the fact that<br />\nthe Democratic candidate for<br />\nPresident in 1904 was Alton Brooks<br />\nParker. In no other case can it be said<br />\nwith such certainty that if the man<br />\nhad lost the nomination he would<br />\nnow be entirely unknown. There is a<br />\ntraditional facile explanation of the<br />\nnomination which at least accounts<br />\nfor the superficial procedures.<br />\nWilliam Jennings Bryan had lost<br />\nstature in the party after his defeat<br />\nof 1900 which was more severe than<br />\nhis loss in 1896. The right to name<br />\nthe party nominee thereupon<br />\nreverted to the right wing of the<br />\nDemoc- atic party, which had chosen<br />\nand continued to respect former<br />\nPresident Grover Cleveland.<br />\nEarly in 1904 the 67-year-old Mr.<br />\nCleveland declined to be considered<br />\nfor the nomination. The Eastern<br />\nparty organizations thereupon swung<br />\nbehind Mr. Cleveland's choice.<br />\nJustice Parker. Mr. Parker had been<br />\nelected Chief Justice of the New<br />\nYork State Court of Appeals in<br />\n1897, when the Democrats were<br />\nsingularly weak in New York, and<br />\nwas the only Democrat to carry the<br />\nstate since Mr. Cleveland's re-election<br />\nas President in 1892.<br />\nNot Bitterly Contested<br />\nFaced with this adequate<br />\nexplanation, it is still difficult to<br />\naccept a major party nomination of a<br />\nman whose opinions on major issues<br />\nand personality was unknown to the<br />\nvast majority of Americans, and even<br />\nto many of those insidehis state.<br />\nJustice Parker had spent most of his<br />\npolitical career on the bench, and so<br />\nhad not been in a position to express<br />\nhimself on contemporary issues.<br />\nParker admittedly won a<br />\nstatewide election in 1897, but a<br />\njudicial election is not normally<br />\ncontested as bitterly as a campaign<br />\nfor Governor, in which any candidate<br /><br />\nmust express himself on major issues.<br />\nIn fact, he had been declining almost<br />\nbiennially to be the gubernatorial<br />\ncandidate. Had he been Governor, he<br />\nwould have been a far stronger<br />\ncandidate for President.<br />\nPersonal Ambition<br />\nTo be sure, something of Justice<br />\nParker's opinions may be gathered<br />\nfrom his judicial decisions, in which<br />\nhe seemed to favor labor unions, and<br />\nfrom an analysis of his associates.<br />\nJustice Parker was a former campaign<br />\nmanager for New York Senator<br />\nDavid B. Hill, and much was inferred<br />\nfrom his support from Mr. Cleveland.<br />\nHill had in fact opposed the<br />\nCleveland renomination of 1892,<br />\nchiefly due to personal ambition and<br />\na desire to build up his own wing of<br />\nthe party; Cleveland and Hill were<br />\nnot sufficiently far apart to disagree<br />\non the proposition that a leader had<br />\nto be found to succeed Mr. Bryan.<br />\nBoth Cleveland and Hill had more<br />\nfollowers than Parker, and neither<br />\nwas unambitious, but each was too<br />\nold to be a viable candidate.<br />\nMoreover, each had so manifested<br />\ntheir convictions as to be anathema<br />\nto the Bryan wing of the party. Not<br />\nenough was known about Parker to<br />\ninspire anyone's enmity.<br />\nSane Candidate<br />\nAnother factor recommending Mr.<br />\nParker was his position as a \"good,<br />\ngray\" judge in the circumstances of<br />\nthis election. The Republicans had a<br />\nprohibitively strong candidate in<br />\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt. As<br />\nmatters stood the election would be<br />\na referendum for or against<br />\nRoosevelt, and while the President<br />\nobviously had achieved a popularity<br />\nequaling idolatry among certain<br />\nvoters, any personality so strong and<br />\nabrasive is certain to acquire several<br />\nvoluble enemies.<br />\nCertain Presidential remarks,<br />\nalthough few Presidential elections,<br />\nhad upset the business community,<br />\nand the Democrats were hopeful that<br />\na \"safe and sane\" candidate L.ould<br /><br />\ngain Wail Street support against<br />\nRoosevelt. That Justice Parker had<br />\nrendered decisions comforting to<br />\nlabor organization was far less known<br />\nthan the fact that his principal<br />\nsponsor, former President Cleveland,<br />\nhad forcibly intervened against labor<br />\nin the Pullman strike of 1894.<br />\nThe very lack of forcefulness in<br />\nthe Justice's personality also<br />\nimproved his standing as a potential<br />\ncandidate against Roosevelt. It did<br />\nappear conceivable that, in a<br />\nreferendum against Roosevelt, there<br />\nwould be a large negative vote. If the<br />\nDemocrats had nominated a forceful<br />\npersonality of their own, such as<br />\nCleveland or William Randolph<br />\nHearst, he himself would have<br />\nalienated many voters. Parker was<br />\nnot sufficiently well-known to<br />\nalienate a voter who was prejudiced<br />\nagainst Roosevelt. He was therefore<br />\npotentially a fair candidate if, like<br />\nmany Democrats, one accepts the<br />\nproposition that the anti-Roosevelt<br />\nvote would be very large.<br />\nFrightful Attrition<br />\nStill, to say that Parker might<br />\nreceive votes because he appeared<br />\nsafe, sane, and coldly judicial is to<br />\ncorroborate, rather than to deny,<br />\nthat, to most of the American<br />\npeople, he was a vague personality<br />\nand an unknown quantity. The best<br />\nsin\" explanation for Parker's<br />\nnomination is that the Democratic<br />\nparty was singularly weak. This was<br />\npartially the fault of Bryan. Since he<br />\nhad become identified with the<br />\nparty, the Democrats had suffered<br />\nfrightful attrition in the large Eastern<br />\nstates which normally produced their<br />\npresidential candidates.<br />\nParker had recently won a<br />\nstatewide election, and this alone put<br />\nhim in the front rank of Eastern<br />\nDemocrats. When Bryan tried to<br />\nthink of an Easterner whom he might<br />\nmore cheerfully support, he could<br />\nmake no better suggestion than<br />\nformer Governor Pattison of<br />\nPennsylvania, who had recently been<br /><br />\ndefeated for re-election.<br />\nChicago Unpleasant<br />\nAs Bryan and Cleveland did not<br />\nchoose to run, none of .the figures<br />\nwho contested Parker's nomination<br />\nwas more magnetic. Delaware offered<br />\nformer Senator George Gray. Like<br />\nParker, Gray was a colorless and<br />\nrighteous judge; unlike Parker, he<br />\nhad never won an election in a<br />\npivotal state. Most of the Bryan<br />\nfollowing preferred publisher Hearst,<br />\nalthough there was no evidence he<br />\ncould be elected to any office. Hearst<br />\nhad been seeking the nomination far<br />\nmore assiduously than Parker; at one<br />\npoint, the Democractic National<br />\nCommittee was so concerned for<br />\nHearst's strength as to shift the<br />\nNational Convention from Chicago,<br />\nwhere he appeared strong. But when<br />\nthe Convention actually assembled in<br />\nSt. Louis, Hearst had unimpressive<br />\nsupport. There were objections that<br />\nthe Democrats owed a Convention to<br />\nChicago; but after the unpleasantness<br />\nof 1968, it will probably be<br />\nconceded that the Democrats have<br />\nassembled in Chicago once too often.<br />\nBryan himself had kind words for<br />\nHearst, but chose to support Senator<br />\nFrancis Cockrell of Missouri.<br />\nIn Congress the Democrats had<br />\nsome articulate spokesman who were<br />\nat least as well qualified for the<br />\nPresidency as Parker.

The troubled dreams of an<br />\noverworked student slumped over his typewriter at four<br />\nin the morning? Neither. Just such a system was termed<br />\n\"inevitable\" in the first of a series of lectures entitled<br />\n\"Computers, Communication, and the Public Interest,\"<br />\nto be delivered this year at the Hopkins School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies in Washington.<br />\nThe computerized library will be made possible by<br />\nthe development of large scale time-sharing computer<br />\nsystems, according to Dr. John Kemeny, Albert Gradley<br />\nThird Century Professor at Dartmouth College, who<br /><br />\ndelivered the talk yesterday.<br />\nA large time-sharing computer system would allow as<br />\nmany as 2000 users to communicate via teletype with<br />\none or more large high speed digital computers<br />\nsimultaneously. The machine switches back and forth<br />\nbetween the various users so rapidly that each one has<br />\nthe illusion that he has the computer all to himself. The<br />\nservice could cost as little as two dollars an hour.<br />\nTime Sharing Advantages<br />\nThe great advantage of computer time-sharing is that<br />\nit allows the user to hold \"conversations\" with the<br />\ncomputer. Instead of waiting hours for the results to<br />\ncome back from the computing center, answers to<br />\nquestions or other information are received within<br />\nseconds.<br />\nThe rapidly diminishing cost of time-sharing facilities<br />\nwill permit a \"computer in every home,\" Dr. Kemeny<br />\nexplained. The harried housewife will be able to do<br />\ncomparative shopping from a terminal in her own<br />\nkitchen, and aspiring but inexperienced quarterbacks<br />\nwill be able to play totally realistic football games<br />\nagainst an opponent anywhere in the world, with the<br />\ncomputer acting as football, field, and referee.<br />\nMan on the Street<br />\nThe possiblities for using computers to improve man's<br />\nexistence are vast. According to Dr. Kemeny, a large<br />\ntime-sharing system could handle the registration of jobs<br />\nand match employee criteria against existing openings.<br />\nOther systems could have similar uses in housing, law<br />\nenforcement, traffic control, education, and medical<br />\ndiagnosis. While computers have done much to improve<br />\nefficiency and reduce cost, \"little or no effort has been<br />\nexpended to try to think up new services, made possible<br />\nby the high speed computer, to make life better for most<br />\nof us. This may be one of the significant reasons why the<br />\nman on the street feels resentment towards computers.\"<br />\nComputers may make possible the mass restructuring<br />\nof our civilization, by facilitating the decentralization of<br />\nour way of life. If business can be conducted by means<br />\nof computers - - allowing instant communication and<br />\ndata recording and retrieving on a world-wide<br /><br />\nbasis - - modern man will not have to infest large urb<br />\nsprawls, now the breeding ground for most social ills.<br />\nIn order to accomplish the use of large time-sharii<br />\nsystems on a national scale, Dr. Kemeny makes thr<br />\nrecommendations concerning national policy towar<br />\nthe computer. First, better methods of forecasti<br />\ncomputer use must be developed to allow ti<br />\ncommunications industry to keep pace with increasi<br />\ndemands. Second, the budget of the National Scien<br />\nFoundation should be increased by 100 million dolla<br />\nto fund the support of computer education. \"I predict<br />\nsays Dr. Kemeny, \"that within a decade the fede<br />\ngovernment will find this one of its most profitat<br />\ninvestments in terms of the vast expansion of t<br />\neconomy and the resulting revenue for the Feder<br />\nGovernment.\"<br />\nFinally, because the research and developme<br />\nneeded to establish such a large scale system are beyo'<br />\nthe means of any local or state government and may r<br />\nbe profitable enough to attract the attention<br />\ncommercial companies, Dr. Kemeny calls for t<br />\ncreation of a National Computer Development Aga<br />\n(NCDA) which would have as its mandate<br />\ndevelopment of systems needed to impleme<br />\ntime-sharing systems on a large scale.<br />\nSeminar Series<br />\nThe seminars, the first of which featured<br />\nKemeny, are held in the auditorium of the Jo<br />\nHopkins University School of Advanced Internatio<br />\nStudies, 1740 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Wash ingt<br />\nD.C. on the second Thursday of each month thro<br />\nApril, 1970. A free bus for each session will leave fr<br />\nLevering Hall at 2 p.m. and return from Washington a<br />\np.m. The next program in the series, entitled \"Designi<br />\nOrganizations for an Information-Rich Society,\" will<br />\nheld on Thursday, October 9 at 4 p.m. The featu<br />\nspeaker is Dr. Herbert A. Simon, professor of compu<br />\nscience and psychology at Carnegie-Mellon Univers'<br />\nThe series is jointly sponsored by Hopkins and I<br />\nBrookings Institute and is funded by grants from t<br />\nAlfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Americ<br />\nFederation of Information Processing Societies.<br /><br />\nNSA Does About Face Regarding Black Demand<br />\nBlack students forced the National<br />\nStudent Association to adopt dramatic<br />\nchanges in its personnel and monetary<br />\nstructure at the organization's 22nd<br />\nannual National Congress.<br />\nCharging at the congress, held in El<br />\nPaso, Texas, that the NSA had<br />\nmisdirected funds for Civil Rights<br />\nprograms since 1961, the Blacks<br />\ndemanded and received $50,000 to<br />\nfinance Black-directed programs from<br />\nthe National Student Association. Gwen<br />\nPatton, a leader of the National<br />\nAssociation of Black Students NABS<br />\nexplained that the money would be<br />\nused for recruitment, scholarships and<br />\nBlack study programs.<br />\nNABS asserted that for the past eight<br />\nyears Blacks had advised the NSA on<br />\nhow to appropriate money but that the<br />\nadvice had received only cursory notice.<br />\nThey claimed that previous programs<br />\nhad been initiated and run with White<br />\nsupervision. NABS proposed that the<br />\ntwo organizations \"operate separately<br />\non each group's priorities and\" ...<br />\ncoalesce on those issues which are<br />\nrelevant to the two groups and other<br />\ngroups so that constructive changes may<br />\nbe brought about for the society.<br />\nA Cry for Reform<br />\nThe NABS statement also<br />\nencouraged the NSA to \"stop slacking<br />\nup by trying to find the easiest<br />\nalternative of not dealing with their<br />\nproblems,\" and rather to gove'ttudents<br />\na direction in which to move. The Black<br />\nexpressed hope that white members<br />\nwould attempt to deal with problems<br />\nsuch as \"institutionalized racism,<br />\nrepressive police actions and measures,<br />\nand irrelevant education.\"<br />\nThe JNSA adopted Black student<br />\nproposals and then proceeded to elect<br />\nnew officers. Charles Palmer, former<br />\npresident of the student body at the<br />\nUniversity of California at Berkeley,<br />\nwon the presidential election for the<br />\ncorning,year<br /><br />\nAside from election of officers and<br />\nestablishing policy the NSA held daily<br />\nworkshops on topics relevant to the<br />\nuniversity environment. Lauren Walters,<br />\nsecretary of the Hopkins Student<br />\nCouncil, who attended the convention<br />\nas an observer said, \"The workshops in<br />\nEducational Reform and Drug Studies<br />\nwere the most valuable aspects of the<br />\nentire conference.\"<br />\nNew Approaches<br />\nWalters claimed that the Educational<br />\nReform seminar had, \"suggested a<br />\nnumber of new approaches to the<br />\nquestion of the quality of<br />\nundergraduate education. This is in my<br />\nopinion, the singularly most important<br />\nproblem facing students at Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe workshop proposed new<br />\ndirections for undergraduate education.<br />\nIt was generally agreed at the meeting<br />\nthat an undergraduate education should<br />\nbe unique from a graduate level<br />\neducation. The group felt that a college<br />\neducation must be oriented toward the<br />\ndevelopment of life styles and<br />\nphilosophies rather than solely the<br />\nacquisition of vocational skills.<br />\nIn the discussions, the question of<br />\nthe possible effects of eliminating grades<br />\non graduate school admission, student<br />\nevaluation of faculty performance, and<br />\nexperimental colleges were discussed.<br />\n\"The Drug Study seminars<br />\nestablished helpful contacts with NSA<br />\nDrug Study Center in Washington, D.

By Monday<br />\nafternoon I'd been frustrated by<br />\na futile encounter with the<br />\nGilman Hall bureaucracy. If this<br />\nsounds more typical to<br /><br />\nupperclassmen, let it be a note<br />\nof Welcome to freshmen.<br />\nMy plight may seem<br />\nsuperficial in the light of the<br />\nastounding changes which have<br />\noccurred on university campuses<br />\nin recent years. It involves<br />\nHopkins' marvelously wideranging Pass/Fail system. As I<br />\nunderstand it, a course not<br />\nincluded in the required<br />\ncurriculum of a student<br />\nattempting to obtain a<br />\ndepartmental major may be<br />\ntaken on the P/f basis. On<br />\nMonday I resolved, being an<br />\nInternational Relations major, to<br />\nfulfill part of my N,Q, or E<br />\nrequirement with a course taken<br />\nP/F. I went to the Registrar's<br />\nOffice and was redirected to Dr.<br />\nDierman's office in Gilman 238.<br />\nHis secretary, renowned for her<br />\ncurt efficiency, told me that I<br />\nwas too late to sign up for the<br />\nP/F option, that Dr. Dierman<br />\nhad extended the deadline to<br />\nnoon, and that I should stop<br />\nbothering her. I insisted that I<br />\nshould speak to Dr. Dierman and<br />\nwas smugly accomodated.<br />\nDierman's approach verged<br /><br />\non the ridiculous. After telling<br />\nhim what I wanted to do, \"lie<br />\ntold me that I was too late.<br />\nSince I wanted to avoid trouble<br />\nbut still be informed, I suggested<br />\nthat he tell me why I had to<br />\nregister P/F at any special time.<br />\nHe was unable to do so. I<br />\nguessed an answer which would<br />\nhave satisfied me, but he refused<br />\nto make it easy for himself.<br />\nNo \u2014 the administrative cost of<br />\nhaving a secretary write one's<br />\nname down on a P/F list is not<br />\ntoo great. He blissfully informed<br />\nme that I hadn't paid enough<br />\nattention to the addenda to our<br />\nantiquated catalog. I repreated<br />\nmy stance: I wasn't getting an A<br />\ngrade in a course for which I'd<br />\nsigned up P/F \u2014 I only wanted<br />\nto take this particular<br />\nnon-departmental course on a<br />\nP/F basis to relieve some of the<br />\nacademic pressure which<br />\nHopkins proudly offers, like a<br />\nsix-year-old displaying the first<br />\ngap in his baby teeth.

Sydnor brings a strong desire and<br />\nsound ideas to this newly created post at Homewood. From his<br />\noffice in the gym he is responsible for getting the sports news to the<br />\nnewspapers and other news media.<br />\nSydnor graduated from Loyola High School in 1957 and attended<br />\nfor one year. He then moved on to Loyola where he graduated<br />\nin 1962 as a<br />\nhistory major. While attending our Charles Street rival,<br />\nhe lettered three timesin swimming. As his sports interest grew, he<br />\nalso managed lacrosse and track.<br />\nGraduated ROTC<br />\nUpon graduation, Jim received a commission as a second<br />\nlieutenant through the Army ROTC Rogram. He spent the next five<br />\nYears as an army infantry officer.<br />\nFrom basic infantry training at Fort Benning he moved on to<br />\nKorea. Upon his return to the U.S., he was stationed at Fort<br />\nLeonard Wood. where he became athletic director and editor of the<br />\ncamp newspaper. From Fort Wood he left for Panama in an airborne<br />\nunit.<br />\nFollowing seven months of training he went to Viet Nam with the<br />\nThird Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division, where he received the<br />\nBronze Star for meritorious service as anintelligence officer.<br />\nWorked for News-American<br />\nAfter his discharge he returned to Baltimore and was the Prep<br />\nSjorts Reporter for Young World Magazine at the<br />\nNews-American. Sydnor hopes to project<br />\nthe image of Hopkins as<br />\na place where we<br />\n\"do things.\" Sports, he feels, offers the university<br />\nan excellent chance<br />\nto relate to undergraduates, alumni, and<br />\nthepublic. This is an opportunity which the university can use.<br />\nSydnor feels athletic competition offers an invaluable training<br />\nPlace where the individual can test his courage. To use one of his<br />\nc'wn metaphors, the university often appears as a streamlined train<br />\nsPee.ding faster and faster towards one goal, that of scholarly<br />\nachievement.<br />\nAs passengers on this train we owe it to ourselves to<br />\nnot allow this train to become our prison.<br />\nAthletics offers an excellent addition to our learning experience<br />\nat Hopkins. The<br />\nfall starts a new career for both Jim Sydnor and the<br />\nfreshman.<br />\nWe wish them both the best of luck.

Toll to suspend a<br />\nstudent caught dealing in drugs. The governing boards<br />\ndecision also provides that if a student is caught and<br />\nconvicted by the courts on a drug rap, he will be<br />\nautomatically suspended from school. The acting<br />\nchairman. of the governing board Said last week that the<br />\nnew drug rules were part of a drug control program<br />\nstarted last year.<br />\nA spokesman for the Student Affairs Committee<br />\nannounced that a survey made this summer of incoming<br />\nfreshman showed that of the 1500 students, 35% said<br />\nthey had used drugs at least once and another 15%<br />\nclaimed that although they had not yet used drugs, they<br />\nplanned to try them.<br />\nEvans Strager, the vice pr sident of the student<br />\ngovernment, stated that the new rules would be<br />\nineffective as a drug deterrent on campus. The Board of<br />\nTrustees should have asked the state legislature to<br />\nlegalize marijuana, he asserted, rather than passing new<br />\nrules. \"They might scare a few a little, initially, but the<br />\nuse of drugs is so widespread that it won't make much<br />\ndifference.\"<br /><br />\n...And Detections<br />\nPresident Nixon took steps this week for an all-out<br />\nwar against Mexican drug smugglers with plans for<br />\nsophisticated weaponry, including radar installations<br />\nalong the border to detect low flying aircraft, torpedo<br />\nboats and an extension of fences along the Mexican<br />\nBorder.<br />\nDetails of the drive, officially designated Operation<br />\nIntercept, are being kept a closely guarded secret<br />\npending administration announcements late this week.<br />\nIn personnel and equipment, though, it will constitute<br />\nthe nation's largest peacetime search and seizure<br />\noperation by civil authorities.<br />\nThe torpedo boats will be employed along the<br />\nseacoast, while remote sensor devices capable of<br />\ndetecting the presence of marijuana and opium poppies<br />\nfrom planes flying over mountainous areas will notify<br />\nborder pursuit planes, according to tentative plans<br />\nThe administration favors some arrangement for<br />\nsupplying the Mexican government with sensing devices<br />\nto find remote marijuana and poppy fields and then<br />\ndestroy them chemically.<br />\nAlong with the President's announcement, a report<br />\nwas released by various government agencies on<br />\nmarijuana and other drugs. The report claims,<br />\n\"Persistent use of an agent which serves to ward off<br />\nreality during this critical period of development is likely<br />\nto effect the future ability of the individual to cope with<br />\nthe demands of a complex society.\"<br /><br />\nThrifty Vacation<br />\nAs President Nixon ended his month-long,<br />\nCalifornia-based, working vacation and headed for<br />\nWashington once again this he left behind some minor<br />\nlegislation and some major bills, the latter mainly paying<br />\nfor the cost of maintaining \u2022 the second \"White House\"<br />\noverlooking the Pacific at San Clemente.<br />\nNixon's vacation has proved expensive to the<br />\nAmerican taxpayer. A one-year lease and the erection of<br />\ntwo staff buildings cost $100,000, excluding the<br />\n$70,000 that the General Services Administration spent<br />\non partitions and furnishings. The Government<br />\npersonnel was housed in a motel, occupying between<br />\n100 and 120 rooms each night of Nixon's stay. At the<br />\nspecial rate of eight dollars a day, the owner was about<br />\n$36,000 richer at the end of the summer.<br />\nAmong the costs not available for one reason or<br />\nanother are, those of the communication systems and the<br />\ncost of flying both personnel and people on business to<br />\nthe President in and out of the state. According to the<br />\nPresident's press secretary, \"If we said what<br />\ncommunications cost, then someone could figure out<br />\nwhat our communication capability is from that dollar<br />\nfigure.\"<br />\nOn Nixon's \"Making Life Bearable\" list were Air<br />\nForce One, private courier planes, ten black limousines<br />\ndriven from Washington at the cost of $9,000, a fleet of<br />\nnine electric golf carts and several bicycles. But it seems<br />\nthat Mr. Nixon is determined not to let the funds spent<br />\non this \"western White House\" go to waste, because lie<br /><br />\nbought himself a $340,000 ocean-front home and he<br />\nshould be in San Clemente again next year.<br /><br />\nCop Courses<br />\nPolice work will invade local campuses this year with<br />\nfederal money aimed at teaching the science of law<br />\nenforcement to any interested student.
