Despite the fact<br />\nthat the Indians had a great reputation for making .end runs with<br />\ntheir fast back-field, when they<br />\ntried them on Hopkins they were<br />\nmiserable failures, and in most<br />\ncases the runner was thrown for<br />\na loss. And on the punts either<br />\nDodson or Musser would drop the<br />\nIndian in his tracks the instant he<br />\nhad caught the ball.<br />\nIn the back-field, Riley and Stollenwerck were the stars. Riley<br />\ntore great holes in the Indians' line,<br />\ngoing through, once for a run of<br />\nforty yards. Stollenwerck made<br />\nthe prettiest drop-kick that Homewood has ever witnessed from the<br />\nIndians' 45-yard line. Dame Fortune willed, however, that Hopkins<br />\nshould not score, for the ball, instead of going over, hit an upright<br />\nof the goal-posts and bounced back.<br />\nPieper and Gillet were also good,<br />\nand Schaefer, Penniman, and<br />\nliehael on the line played a strong<br />\ngame.<br />\nAll through the game luck was<br />\nWith the Indians. That Stonie's<br />\nkick didn't go over was luck; and<br />\nthat KennerlY, the Indians' fast<br />\nright end, should be more fleet of<br />\nfoot than Dodson was pure luck.<br />\nReferee Greshham Poe blew his<br />\nWhistle at 2.30 on the dot, and with<br />\nthe sound still in the air Powell,<br />\nof the Indians, kicked to Hopkins<br />\n5-yard line. Riley ran the ball<br />\nback five yards.<br />\nPieper tore<br />\nthrough the Indians for five yards<br />\nmore. Then they braced and held<br />\nnopkins for two downs.<br />\nGillet kicked and Musser downed<br />\nthe Indian as he caught the ball.<br />\nCarlisle fumbled and Pieper recovered it, on Hopkins 35-yard line.<br />\nGillet was given the leather, and he<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER 21, 1910.<br />\ngot away with thirty yards before<br />\nthe Redskins downed him.<br />\nHopkins was held for two<br />\ndowns and Stonie made a try at<br />\ngoal from Carlisle's 45-yard line.<br />\nThe ball hit against a goal post,<br />\nand, not as in the St. Johns game,<br />\nCarlisle rerebounded inside.<br />\ncovered the ball, but was held for<br />\ndown's and kicked. Stonie caught<br />\nit, but was thrown before he could<br />\nget started.<br />\nRiley made a sensational run<br />\nthrough the Indians for forty yards,<br />\nbut unfortunately fumbled the ball<br />\nwhen he was tackled. Carlisle<br />\nrecovered it, and went down the<br />\nfield by line 'plunging. The first<br />\nquarter ended with the ball in<br />\nCarlisle's possession.<br />\nIn the first two minutes of the<br />\nsecond quarter, Dupuis, by a trick<br />\nplay, went through the Hopkins<br />\nline, and, before he could be stopped, made a touchdown. Powell<br />\nkicked goal.<br />\nThe Indians kicked to Hopkins,<br />\nbut the ball fell behind the. goal<br />\nposts. It was brought out and put<br />\nin scrimmage, on Hopkins' 25-yard<br />\nline. Belt went in at center, as<br />\nMcCabe had received a knock on<br />\nhis lame ankle. Dodson on the<br />\nnext play made thirty-five yards on<br />\na forward pass. Hopkins tried<br />\nanother forward pass, but it failed,<br />\nand . the Indians got -the ball.<br />\nCarisle kicked and Stonie ran the<br />\nball back ten yards. The first half<br />\nended with the ball in Hopkins'<br />\npossession on its 40-yard line.<br />\nThe beginning of the second half<br />\nsaw Dick McCabe back at center.<br />\nCarlisle kicked to Hopkins' io-yard<br />\nline. Gillet ran the ball back fwentyfive yards. The ball was fumble-d,<br />\nand lucky Carlisle recovered it.<br />\nOn the next play the Indians<br />\ntried a double pass, but Dodson,<br />\nbreaking through the line, caught<br />\nthe ball when the Redskin passed<br />\nit, and with a clear field ahead of<br />\nhim started for Carlisle's goal.<br />\nHad Dodson been a little faster a<br />\ntouchdown would have been ineyitable, but Kennerly, the Indian's<br />\nspeedy right end, caught him on<br />\nCarlisle's 20-yard line.

OBERHUMMER LECTURES<br />\n<br />\nHopkins and Washington College Will<br />\nClash at Homewood in Final<br />\nGame of the Year.<br />\n<br />\nNoted Austrian Geographer Here and<br />\nTalks of Human Geography<br />\nin Many Phases.<br />\n<br />\nA series of three lectures was<br />\ndelivered in McCoy Hall, Monday,<br />\nTuesday and Wednesday last by<br />\nDr. Eugen Oberhummer, professor<br />\nof historical and political geography<br />\nin the University of Vienna.<br />\n1. The first lecture was devoted to the history of ;:he development of human geography as a<br />\nscience distinct from physiography.<br />\nIn very early antiquity, Dr. Oberhummer steted, in the times of<br />\nPythagoras and Herodotus, two<br />\nkinds of geography were recognized \u2014 scientific and historical.<br />\nDuring the ignorance of the Middle<br />\nAges and the scientific fervor of<br />\nthe Rennaissance, this distinction<br />\nwas to a great extent lost sight of;<br />\nand it was not propounded again<br />\nuntil 1650, when Varenius divided<br />\ngeography into two classes\u2014mathematical and histcrical. The study<br />\nof historical geography increased<br />\nthroughout the seventecnth and<br />\neighteenth centuries; but it degenerated on the one hand into a mere<br />\nstudy of artificial political boundaries, and on the other of vast<br />\nmasses of curious or statistical information. It is not here that we<br />\nmust look for the beginnings of<br />\nhuman geography, which is the<br />\nstudy of the relations of man to<br />\ngeographical surroundings. Those<br />\nbeginnings are to be sought rather<br />\nin authors who had little idea of<br />\nwriting geography\u2014in Hippocrates<br />\nthe physician among the ancients,<br />\nand in Montesquieu among the<br />\nmoderns. The real establishment of<br />\nhuman geography as a science,<br />\nhowever, was the achievement of<br />\nKarl Rittet, a professor at the University of Berlin, whose stupendous<br />\nwork on \"Geography and Its Connections With the Nature and History of Man\" was left unfinished<br />\nat his death in 1859. The progress<br />\nof the new science was considerably<br />\nfurthered by the great Count Humboldt, notably in his \"Political Essay<br />\nupon the State of New Spain.\"<br />\nAfter the influence of these illustrious pioneers had subsided, a reaction followed during which the<br />\nattention of nearly all geographers<br />\nwas directed entirely upon the<br />\nscientific aspect of their subject. In<br />\nmore recent years, however, the<br />\nstudy of human geography was<br />\nrevived in a startling series of books<br />\nA large part of the library of the by a professor in the University<br />\nlate Professor A. Marshall Elliott, of Munich, Dr. Ratzel, Whose pupil<br />\nwhich was left by his will to the Dr. Oberhummer stated that he<br />\nUniversity, was received at McCoy himself had had the good fortune to<br />\nHall last Friday, and stored on the be. At present human geography is<br />\nfourth floor until a 'definite location still a comparatively new science and<br />\ncan be found for it.<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 2.)<br />\nHopkins will play the Washington College eleven of Chestertown,<br />\non Thanksgiving Day, at Homewood. This game was definitely<br />\nscheduled by Manager Haynes last<br />\nweek. Washington College has<br />\nbeen clamoring for a game for a<br />\nnumber of years, but until recently<br />\nit has not been considered worthy<br />\nof a place on the Hopkins schedule.<br />\nThe situation was changed when<br />\nthe Eastern Shore lads downed the<br />\nstrong team of Rutgers College a<br />\nweek ago. This victory was quite<br />\na feather in the caps of Mike<br />\nThompson's squad, as Rutgers had<br />\nplayed Navy a scoreless tie earlier<br />\nthis season.<br />\nNow that Hopkins is going to<br />\nplay the Chestertown aggregation,<br />\nit is expected that the Black and<br />\nBlue will win a decisive victory<br />\nand silence, once and forever, the<br />\ntalk of the Washington College<br />\nplayers that Hopkins cannot claim<br />\nthe state championship without<br />\ndefeating them. If the Eastern<br />\nShore team gives Hopkins a hard<br />\nfight, it will be justified in demanding to be taken into account in the<br />\nrace for the state championship,<br />\nand in asking for a yearly game<br />\nwith ,Hopkins; but if it is badly<br />\ndefeated, it cannot object to being<br />\nomitted from the Hopkins schedules<br />\nin the future.<br />\nHopkins probably will not be<br />\nrepresented by its full strength<br />\nThursday, as Coach Lynn wants<br />\nto give the substitutes a chance.<br />\nUnless they are urgentl- needed,<br />\nseveral of the regular Hopkins<br />\nstars will probably warm the players' bench. Hopkins and Washington College are the only local<br />\nteams of any importance that will<br />\nplay on Thanksgiving day. The<br />\nattendance, therefore, ought to be<br />\nlarge, as many people make it a<br />\npoint not to let a Thanksgiving<br />\nday go by without seeing a football team.

We<br />\nare not aware in the first place of<br />\nthe existence of any socialistically<br />\ninclined students here at Hopkins,<br />\nand in the second place we do not<br />\nthink that if there are any here,<br />\nthey intend to form such a society<br />\nas the one described. If any such<br />\nplan is being considered, we wish<br />\nthat it may be communicated to<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, so that we can<br />\nmake an exclusive announcement<br />\nand can score a beat on our New<br />\nYork contemporary.<br />\nWith the organization this year<br />\nof the arbitration society we thought<br />\nthat there were here at this Uniersity enough interests outside the<br />\nclass-room, and when the musical<br />\nclubs were rejuvenated, this belief<br />\nwas strenghtened. Apparently, if<br />\nthe report of the Intercollegiate<br />\nSociety is correct, we haven't<br />\nreached the end yet; and soon we<br />\nmay have a Republican Club, a<br />\nDemocratic Union, and a ProhibiStave off the<br />\ntion Sorority.<br />\nSocialistic society, please, as it<br />\nmight serve as the forerunner for<br />\n<br />\ncriticism of a course that is required<br />\nof all undergraduates, we wish to<br />\nremind our readers that THE NEWSLETTER takes no responsibility for<br />\nviews that are thus made public<br />\nfurther than to make sure that they<br />\nare bona fide utterances of readers<br />\nof the paper.<br />\nIn the present case we agree with<br />\nthe general idea of less lecture and<br />\nmore recitation in undergraduate<br />\ncourses,though we are not at all sure<br />\nthat all that is said of the particular<br />\ncourse mentioned is justified. The<br />\ngi ound covered by the minor physics<br />\ncourse is extensive and only a<br />\nsuperficial knowledge of the subject<br />\nas a whole can be expected.

Two<br />\nvery interesting papers were given:<br />\none by Professor Ames on the<br />\nmeeting of the International Society for Solar Research, at Mt.<br />\n'Wilson, and the other by Professor<br />\nn:Irews on the expedition sent by<br />\nthe University to Jamaica last summer.<br />\nThe International Society for<br />\nSolar Research was formed in St.<br />\nLouis nine years ago when a num'ber of famous scientists happened<br />\nto he present in that city. Six<br />\nYears ago a meeting was held at<br />\nOxford, England; three years later<br />\none was held in Paris ; and in 1913<br />\nthe Society will meet in Bonn, Germany. The meeting was held at<br />\nMt. Wilson this summer, lai-gely<br />\nas a compliment to Professor Hale,<br />\nwho is today unsurpassed in astronomical research. Scientists from<br />\nall over the world were present,<br />\nabout forty from Europe, and forty<br />\nfrom America. The work of the<br />\nSociety is divided 'among a number of permanent commttees which<br />\nmake reports at the tri-yearly meetings.- These committees are:<br />\nThe Committee on Standard<br />\nWave Lengths, of which Professor<br />\nAmes is a member.<br />\nThe Committee on Solar Eclipses.<br />\nIt is evident that in order that<br />\nthere may be successful observations, there should be some agreenient between the observatories as<br />\nto what they are to look for during the eclipses. That is one of<br />\nthe functions of this committee.<br />\nIts other duties are to propose<br />\nProblems for investigation and to<br />\ndevise instruments for the observation of eclipses of the sun. One<br />\nimportant question now being investigated is that of the constancy<br />\nof solar radiation. It was first<br />\nObserved by Professor. Langley<br />\nthat for about six weeks there was<br />\na diminution in the solar radiation, after which period it returned<br />\nto the normal amount. It is expected that when we learn more\u2022<br />\nabout solar radiation, we shall be<br />\nable to predict changes in the<br />\nWeather more certainly.<br />\nThe Committee on Sun Spots.<br />\nSun spots have been under 'observation from the time of Galileo.<br />\n<br />\nSome years ago Professor Hale,<br />\nthe director of the Mt. Wilson<br />\nobservatory, discovered evidences<br />\nof a magnetic field around the sun<br />\nspots. He noticed also that the<br />\nspectrum of light issuing from or<br />\nnear the sun spots was very different from the spectrum of ordinary sunlight. These discoveries<br />\nsuggested many heretofore unsuspected phenomena.<br />\nThe Committee on the Spectroheliograph. The Spectroheliograph<br />\nis an instrument by means of which<br />\nit is possible to observe the sun<br />\nby colored light. The surface of<br />\nthe sun presents very different appearances when seen through glass<br />\nplates of different colors. In this<br />\nway we can learn a great deal<br />\nabout the atmospheric conditions<br />\non the sun. The principal work.<br />\nof this committee is to see that<br />\nspectroheliographs are constructed<br />\nand installed in all the observatories of the world, so that a continual watch can be kept on the<br />\nsurface of the sun.<br />\nThe second paper of the meeting was read by Professor Andrews. Professor Andrews gave a<br />\nshort account of the previous relations of Johns Hopkins with the<br />\nisland of Jamaica, from the time<br />\nwhen Professor Brooks established<br />\nthe first laboratory at Kingston in<br />\n1891, to the fateful expedition to<br />\nPort Antonio, on which Professor<br />\nHumphreys and Dr. Conant lost<br />\ntheir lives. Then Professor Andrews described the surroundings<br />\nof the laboratory, the river, the islands with their mangrove swamps,<br />\nthe coral reefs, all of which furnished abundant material for study.<br />\nThe meeting was livened up a<br />\nbit by the live cabs which Dr.<br />\nAndrews brought in, two hermit<br />\ncrabs, a white crab, and a black<br />\ncrab. The latter animal is much<br />\nesteemed by the Jamaicans for<br />\nfood, and bears a reputation comparable to that of our soft crabs.<br />\nThe hermit crabs live on the land;<br />\nbut once a year they go down to<br />\nthe sea, traveling in an absolutely<br />\nstraight line, crawling over all obstacles instead of going around<br />\nthem, in order to deposit in the<br />\nwater the young ones -which they<br />\ncarry with them. The young stay<br />\nin the water for some time. Then<br />\nthey crawl out and pick up a snailshell in which to live, and travel<br />\nup to the mountains, where they<br />\nare usually found.<br />\nProfessor Andrews showed a<br />\nmyriad of shells which .were collected in ponds. They were of<br />\n<br />\ntwo kinds, the one small and<br />\nlight-colored, the other large and<br />\ndark-colored. The small ones and<br />\nlarge ones were found in the same<br />\npond within a short distance of<br />\none another, and apparently under<br />\nthe same conditions. But it was<br />\nfound that the water in which the<br />\ndark-colored ones grew was slightly more saline, which apparently<br />\ninfluenced the size and color of<br />\nthe shells.<br />\nDr. Andrews was forced to cut<br />\nhis talk somewhat short, because<br />\nof the lecture in McCoy Hall.

Most of the races<br />\nbelong, however, to the same great<br />\ntype of humanity, the one which has<br />\nat various times been called the<br />\nwhite, the Mediterranean, and the<br />\nCaucasian to distinguish it from<br />\nthe black, the red, the yellow, and<br />\nthe brown types.<br />\nIn Dr. Oberhummer's opinion,<br />\nthe earliest appearance of man in<br />\nEurope was in the Paleolithic Age.<br />\nTo be sure, various unfashioned instruments have been unearthed,<br />\n. which are by some supposed to<br />\nbetray the existence of Neolithic<br />\nmen; but the earliest human bones<br />\ndiscovered belong to the Paleolithic<br />\nAge. Several skulls dating from<br />\nthis period have been found in Germany, and some complete skeletons<br />\nin France; but it is as yet uncertain<br />\nwhether or not these are the relics<br />\nof the ancestors of man, or of some<br />\ncollateral descendants of a common<br />\nancestor.<br />\nThere are traces,Dr.Oberhummer<br />\nsaid, that the whole west of Europe<br />\nwas once inhabited by men of<br />\nnegro type. The east was at the<br />\nsame time occupied by a people<br />\nresembling the Mongols. The chief<br />\ndistinguishing mark between these<br />\ntwo races is the shape of the skull,<br />\nwhich in the case of the former is<br />\nelongated, in that of the latter<br />\nbroadened. At present there are<br />\nthree .types of man in Europe: in<br />\nthe north a type tall of stature,<br />\nlong of skull, blond of complexion;<br />\nin the center a type stocky of stature,<br />\nlong of skull, and dark of complexion (not Celtic but Siberian) ;<br />\nand in the Alps a peculiar type with<br />\na small round skull and a middle<br />\nstature.<br />\nThe blond type is peculiar to<br />\nEurope; and, furthermore, it was to<br />\nbe found originally only in the<br />\nScandinavian peninsula and on the<br />\nshores of the Baltic. A peculiar<br />\nfact is that at the time of the appearance of man in southern and<br />\nwestern Europe, all this territory<br />\nwas covered with a great ice-sheet.<br />\nEvidently, the blond type is a composite of post-glacial origin.<br />\nDr. Oberhummer warned his<br />\naudience not to place too much confidence in philology as an aid to<br />\nthe study of ethnology. Language,<br />\nhe said, was the product rather of<br />\nhistorical than ethnological events;<br />\nand cited the cases of the Roumanians and of the Basques to prove his<br />\ncontention.<br />\n3.

Despite the fact<br />\nthat the Indians had a great reputation for making .end runs with<br />\ntheir fast back-field, when they<br />\ntried them on Hopkins they were<br />\nmiserable failures, and in most<br />\ncases the runner was thrown for<br />\na loss. And on the punts either<br />\nDodson or Musser would drop the<br />\nIndian in his tracks the instant he<br />\nhad caught the ball.<br />\nIn the back-field, Riley and Stollenwerck were the stars. Riley<br />\ntore great holes in the Indians' line,<br />\ngoing through, once for a run of<br />\nforty yards. Stollenwerck made<br />\nthe prettiest drop-kick that Homewood has ever witnessed from the<br />\nIndians' 45-yard line. Dame Fortune willed, however, that Hopkins<br />\nshould not score, for the ball, instead of going over, hit an upright<br />\nof the goal-posts and bounced back.<br />\nPieper and Gillet were also good,<br />\nand Schaefer, Penniman, and<br />\nliehael on the line played a strong<br />\ngame.<br />\nAll through the game luck was<br />\nWith the Indians. That Stonie's<br />\nkick didn't go over was luck; and<br />\nthat KennerlY, the Indians' fast<br />\nright end, should be more fleet of<br />\nfoot than Dodson was pure luck.<br />\nReferee Greshham Poe blew his<br />\nWhistle at 2.30 on the dot, and with<br />\nthe sound still in the air Powell,<br />\nof the Indians, kicked to Hopkins<br />\n5-yard line. Riley ran the ball<br />\nback five yards.<br />\nPieper tore<br />\nthrough the Indians for five yards<br />\nmore. Then they braced and held<br />\nnopkins for two downs.<br />\nGillet kicked and Musser downed<br />\nthe Indian as he caught the ball.<br />\nCarlisle fumbled and Pieper recovered it, on Hopkins 35-yard line.<br />\nGillet was given the leather, and he<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER 21, 1910.<br />\ngot away with thirty yards before<br />\nthe Redskins downed him.<br />\nHopkins was held for two<br />\ndowns and Stonie made a try at<br />\ngoal from Carlisle's 45-yard line.<br />\nThe ball hit against a goal post,<br />\nand, not as in the St. Johns game,<br />\nCarlisle rerebounded inside.<br />\ncovered the ball, but was held for<br />\ndown's and kicked. Stonie caught<br />\nit, but was thrown before he could<br />\nget started.<br />\nRiley made a sensational run<br />\nthrough the Indians for forty yards,<br />\nbut unfortunately fumbled the ball<br />\nwhen he was tackled. Carlisle<br />\nrecovered it, and went down the<br />\nfield by line 'plunging. The first<br />\nquarter ended with the ball in<br />\nCarlisle's possession.<br />\nIn the first two minutes of the<br />\nsecond quarter, Dupuis, by a trick<br />\nplay, went through the Hopkins<br />\nline, and, before he could be stopped, made a touchdown. Powell<br />\nkicked goal.<br />\nThe Indians kicked to Hopkins,<br />\nbut the ball fell behind the. goal<br />\nposts. It was brought out and put<br />\nin scrimmage, on Hopkins' 25-yard<br />\nline. Belt went in at center, as<br />\nMcCabe had received a knock on<br />\nhis lame ankle. Dodson on the<br />\nnext play made thirty-five yards on<br />\na forward pass. Hopkins tried<br />\nanother forward pass, but it failed,<br />\nand . the Indians got -the ball.<br />\nCarisle kicked and Stonie ran the<br />\nball back ten yards.

The ball was fumble-d,<br />\nand lucky Carlisle recovered it.<br />\nOn the next play the Indians<br />\ntried a double pass, but Dodson,<br />\nbreaking through the line, caught<br />\nthe ball when the Redskin passed<br />\nit, and with a clear field ahead of<br />\nhim started for Carlisle's goal.<br />\nHad Dodson been a little faster a<br />\ntouchdown would have been ineyitable, but Kennerly, the Indian's<br />\nspeedy right end, caught him on<br />\nCarlisle's 20-yard line.

OBERHUMMER LECTURES<br /><br />\nHopkins and Washington College Will<br />\nClash at Homewood in Final<br />\nGame of the Year.<br /><br />\nNoted Austrian Geographer Here and<br />\nTalks of Human Geography<br />\nin Many Phases.<br /><br />\nA series of three lectures was<br />\ndelivered in McCoy Hall, Monday,<br />\nTuesday and Wednesday last by<br />\nDr. Eugen Oberhummer, professor<br />\nof historical and political geography<br />\nin the University of Vienna.<br />\n1. The first lecture was devoted to the history of ;:he development of human geography as a<br />\nscience distinct from physiography.<br />\nIn very early antiquity, Dr. Oberhummer steted, in the times of<br />\nPythagoras and Herodotus, two<br />\nkinds of geography were recognized \u2014 scientific and historical.<br />\nDuring the ignorance of the Middle<br />\nAges and the scientific fervor of<br />\nthe Rennaissance, this distinction<br />\nwas to a great extent lost sight of;<br />\nand it was not propounded again<br />\nuntil 1650, when Varenius divided<br />\ngeography into two classes\u2014mathematical and histcrical. The study<br />\nof historical geography increased<br />\nthroughout the seventecnth and<br />\neighteenth centuries; but it degenerated on the one hand into a mere<br />\nstudy of artificial political boundaries, and on the other of vast<br />\nmasses of curious or statistical information. It is not here that we<br />\nmust look for the beginnings of<br />\nhuman geography, which is the<br />\nstudy of the relations of man to<br />\ngeographical surroundings. Those<br />\nbeginnings are to be sought rather<br />\nin authors who had little idea of<br />\nwriting geography\u2014in Hippocrates<br />\nthe physician among the ancients,<br />\nand in Montesquieu among the<br />\nmoderns. The real establishment of<br />\nhuman geography as a science,<br />\nhowever, was the achievement of<br />\nKarl Rittet, a professor at the University of Berlin, whose stupendous<br />\nwork on \"Geography and Its Connections With the Nature and History of Man\" was left unfinished<br />\nat his death in 1859. The progress<br />\nof the new science was considerably<br />\nfurthered by the great Count Humboldt, notably in his \"Political Essay<br />\nupon the State of New Spain.\"<br />\nAfter the influence of these illustrious pioneers had subsided, a reaction followed during which the<br />\nattention of nearly all geographers<br />\nwas directed entirely upon the<br />\nscientific aspect of their subject. In<br />\nmore recent years, however, the<br />\nstudy of human geography was<br />\nrevived in a startling series of books<br />\nA large part of the library of the by a professor in the University<br />\nlate Professor A. Marshall Elliott, of Munich, Dr. Ratzel, Whose pupil<br />\nwhich was left by his will to the Dr. Oberhummer stated that he<br />\nUniversity, was received at McCoy himself had had the good fortune to<br />\nHall last Friday, and stored on the be. At present human geography is<br />\nfourth floor until a 'definite location still a comparatively new science and<br />\ncan be found for it.<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 2.)<br />\nHopkins will play the Washington College eleven of Chestertown,<br />\non Thanksgiving Day, at Homewood. This game was definitely<br />\nscheduled by Manager Haynes last<br />\nweek. Washington College has<br />\nbeen clamoring for a game for a<br />\nnumber of years, but until recently<br />\nit has not been considered worthy<br />\nof a place on the Hopkins schedule.<br />\nThe situation was changed when<br />\nthe Eastern Shore lads downed the<br />\nstrong team of Rutgers College a<br />\nweek ago. This victory was quite<br />\na feather in the caps of Mike<br />\nThompson's squad, as Rutgers had<br />\nplayed Navy a scoreless tie earlier<br />\nthis season.<br />\nNow that Hopkins is going to<br />\nplay the Chestertown aggregation,<br />\nit is expected that the Black and<br />\nBlue will win a decisive victory<br />\nand silence, once and forever, the<br />\ntalk of the Washington College<br />\nplayers that Hopkins cannot claim<br />\nthe state championship without<br />\ndefeating them. If the Eastern<br />\nShore team gives Hopkins a hard<br />\nfight, it will be justified in demanding to be taken into account in the<br />\nrace for the state championship,<br />\nand in asking for a yearly game<br />\nwith ,Hopkins; but if it is badly<br />\ndefeated, it cannot object to being<br />\nomitted from the Hopkins schedules<br />\nin the future.<br />\nHopkins probably will not be<br />\nrepresented by its full strength<br />\nThursday, as Coach Lynn wants<br />\nto give the substitutes a chance.<br />\nUnless they are urgentl- needed,<br />\nseveral of the regular Hopkins<br />\nstars will probably warm the players' bench. Hopkins and Washington College are the only local<br />\nteams of any importance that will<br />\nplay on Thanksgiving day. The<br />\nattendance, therefore, ought to be<br />\nlarge, as many people make it a<br />\npoint not to let a Thanksgiving<br />\nday go by without seeing a football team.

Two<br />\nvery interesting papers were given:<br />\none by Professor Ames on the<br />\nmeeting of the International Society for Solar Research, at Mt.<br />\n'Wilson, and the other by Professor<br />\nn:Irews on the expedition sent by<br />\nthe University to Jamaica last summer.<br />\nThe International Society for<br />\nSolar Research was formed in St.<br />\nLouis nine years ago when a num'ber of famous scientists happened<br />\nto he present in that city. Six<br />\nYears ago a meeting was held at<br />\nOxford, England; three years later<br />\none was held in Paris ; and in 1913<br />\nthe Society will meet in Bonn, Germany. The meeting was held at<br />\nMt. Wilson this summer, lai-gely<br />\nas a compliment to Professor Hale,<br />\nwho is today unsurpassed in astronomical research. Scientists from<br />\nall over the world were present,<br />\nabout forty from Europe, and forty<br />\nfrom America. The work of the<br />\nSociety is divided 'among a number of permanent commttees which<br />\nmake reports at the tri-yearly meetings.- These committees are:<br />\nThe Committee on Standard<br />\nWave Lengths, of which Professor<br />\nAmes is a member.<br />\nThe Committee on Solar Eclipses.<br />\nIt is evident that in order that<br />\nthere may be successful observations, there should be some agreenient between the observatories as<br />\nto what they are to look for during the eclipses. That is one of<br />\nthe functions of this committee.<br />\nIts other duties are to propose<br />\nProblems for investigation and to<br />\ndevise instruments for the observation of eclipses of the sun. One<br />\nimportant question now being investigated is that of the constancy<br />\nof solar radiation. It was first<br />\nObserved by Professor. Langley<br />\nthat for about six weeks there was<br />\na diminution in the solar radiation, after which period it returned<br />\nto the normal amount. It is expected that when we learn more\u2022<br />\nabout solar radiation, we shall be<br />\nable to predict changes in the<br />\nWeather more certainly.<br />\nThe Committee on Sun Spots.<br />\nSun spots have been under 'observation from the time of Galileo.<br /><br />\nSome years ago Professor Hale,<br />\nthe director of the Mt. Wilson<br />\nobservatory, discovered evidences<br />\nof a magnetic field around the sun<br />\nspots. He noticed also that the<br />\nspectrum of light issuing from or<br />\nnear the sun spots was very different from the spectrum of ordinary sunlight. These discoveries<br />\nsuggested many heretofore unsuspected phenomena.<br />\nThe Committee on the Spectroheliograph. The Spectroheliograph<br />\nis an instrument by means of which<br />\nit is possible to observe the sun<br />\nby colored light. The surface of<br />\nthe sun presents very different appearances when seen through glass<br />\nplates of different colors. In this<br />\nway we can learn a great deal<br />\nabout the atmospheric conditions<br />\non the sun. The principal work.<br />\nof this committee is to see that<br />\nspectroheliographs are constructed<br />\nand installed in all the observatories of the world, so that a continual watch can be kept on the<br />\nsurface of the sun.<br />\nThe second paper of the meeting was read by Professor Andrews. Professor Andrews gave a<br />\nshort account of the previous relations of Johns Hopkins with the<br />\nisland of Jamaica, from the time<br />\nwhen Professor Brooks established<br />\nthe first laboratory at Kingston in<br />\n1891, to the fateful expedition to<br />\nPort Antonio, on which Professor<br />\nHumphreys and Dr. Conant lost<br />\ntheir lives. Then Professor Andrews described the surroundings<br />\nof the laboratory, the river, the islands with their mangrove swamps,<br />\nthe coral reefs, all of which furnished abundant material for study.<br />\nThe meeting was livened up a<br />\nbit by the live cabs which Dr.<br />\nAndrews brought in, two hermit<br />\ncrabs, a white crab, and a black<br />\ncrab. The latter animal is much<br />\nesteemed by the Jamaicans for<br />\nfood, and bears a reputation comparable to that of our soft crabs.<br />\nThe hermit crabs live on the land;<br />\nbut once a year they go down to<br />\nthe sea, traveling in an absolutely<br />\nstraight line, crawling over all obstacles instead of going around<br />\nthem, in order to deposit in the<br />\nwater the young ones -which they<br />\ncarry with them. The young stay<br />\nin the water for some time. Then<br />\nthey crawl out and pick up a snailshell in which to live, and travel<br />\nup to the mountains, where they<br />\nare usually found.<br />\nProfessor Andrews showed a<br />\nmyriad of shells which .were collected in ponds. They were of<br /><br />\ntwo kinds, the one small and<br />\nlight-colored, the other large and<br />\ndark-colored. The small ones and<br />\nlarge ones were found in the same<br />\npond within a short distance of<br />\none another, and apparently under<br />\nthe same conditions. But it was<br />\nfound that the water in which the<br />\ndark-colored ones grew was slightly more saline, which apparently<br />\ninfluenced the size and color of<br />\nthe shells.<br />\nDr. Andrews was forced to cut<br />\nhis talk somewhat short, because<br />\nof the lecture in McCoy Hall. But<br />\nhe said sufficient to show the great<br />\nvalue of these expeditions to the<br />\ntropics.<br />\nMedical Society Hears Papers.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital<br />\nMedical Society met on Monday<br />\nevening, November 14, in the Medical Ampitheatre. There was an<br />\nattendance of about one hundred<br />\nand fifty. The first paper was by<br />\nDrs. Wm. S. Thayer and Roger S.<br />\nMorris (read by the former) on<br />\n\"Two Cases of Congenital Hemolytic Jaundice.\" The paper was illustrated by microscopic preparations. After its conclusion the subject was further discussed by Dr.<br />\nW. L. Moss.<br />\n, Dr. J. Staige Davis read a most<br />\ninteresting article upon \"Wounds<br />\nof the Scalp and Their Treatment<br />\nby Skin-Grafting.\" After reviewing the history of this subject he<br />\nreported cases which came under<br />\nhis own direct observation, and<br />\nconcluded with a series of lantern<br />\nslides illustrating the operations<br />\ndiscussed.<br />\nLectures on History of Religions.<br /><br />\nProfessor J. J. M. de Groot, of<br />\nthe University of Leyden, will give<br />\nsix lectures in McCoy Hall at 5<br />\np. in. His subject will be \"The<br />\nDevelopment of Religious Ideas<br />\nin China.\" .The topics and dates<br />\nare as follows:<br />\nNovember 23\u2014The Tao or Order<br />\nof the Universe.<br />\nNovember 28\u2014The Tao of Man.<br />\nNovember 30\u2014Holiness.<br />\nDecember 2\u2014Asceticism.

Most of the races<br />\nbelong, however, to the same great<br />\ntype of humanity, the one which has<br />\nat various times been called the<br />\nwhite, the Mediterranean, and the<br />\nCaucasian to distinguish it from<br />\nthe black, the red, the yellow, and<br />\nthe brown types.<br />\nIn Dr. Oberhummer's opinion,<br />\nthe earliest appearance of man in<br />\nEurope was in the Paleolithic Age.<br />\nTo be sure, various unfashioned instruments have been unearthed,<br />\n. which are by some supposed to<br />\nbetray the existence of Neolithic<br />\nmen; but the earliest human bones<br />\ndiscovered belong to the Paleolithic<br />\nAge. Several skulls dating from<br />\nthis period have been found in Germany, and some complete skeletons<br />\nin France; but it is as yet uncertain<br />\nwhether or not these are the relics<br />\nof the ancestors of man, or of some<br />\ncollateral descendants of a common<br />\nancestor.<br />\nThere are traces,Dr.Oberhummer<br />\nsaid, that the whole west of Europe<br />\nwas once inhabited by men of<br />\nnegro type. The east was at the<br />\nsame time occupied by a people<br />\nresembling the Mongols. The chief<br />\ndistinguishing mark between these<br />\ntwo races is the shape of the skull,<br />\nwhich in the case of the former is<br />\nelongated, in that of the latter<br />\nbroadened. At present there are<br />\nthree .types of man in Europe: in<br />\nthe north a type tall of stature,<br />\nlong of skull, blond of complexion;<br />\nin the center a type stocky of stature,<br />\nlong of skull, and dark of complexion (not Celtic but Siberian) ;<br />\nand in the Alps a peculiar type with<br />\na small round skull and a middle<br />\nstature.<br />\nThe blond type is peculiar to<br />\nEurope; and, furthermore, it was to<br />\nbe found originally only in the<br />\nScandinavian peninsula and on the<br />\nshores of the Baltic. A peculiar<br />\nfact is that at the time of the appearance of man in southern and<br />\nwestern Europe, all this territory<br />\nwas covered with a great ice-sheet.<br />\nEvidently, the blond type is a composite of post-glacial origin.<br />\nDr. Oberhummer warned his<br />\naudience not to place too much confidence in philology as an aid to<br />\nthe study of ethnology. Language,<br />\nhe said, was the product rather of<br />\nhistorical than ethnological events;<br />\nand cited the cases of the Roumanians and of the Basques to prove his<br />\ncontention.<br />\n3.
