It's time to recognize the facts so we can<br />\ndeal effectively now with our environmental problems.<br />\n1. The U.S. has the fastest growing population of any<br />\ncountry in the industrialized Western World \u2014 approaching<br />\n3,000,000 per year!<br />\n2. In the next 31 years, by the year 2020,if current trends<br />\ncontinue, today's U.S. population of 247 million will<br />\nincrease to nearly 300 million and continue to grow \u2014 we<br />\nwill add two and a half times more people than the rest of<br />\nthe industrialized western countries combined.<br />\n<br />\n3. Last<br />\n<br />\nyear alone, California's population grew by<br />\n662,000 people \u2014that's almost equivalent to adding<br />\nanother San Francisco every 12 months. And does Boston<br />\nneed more people when its landfills are already closing<br />\nand ocean dumping is being considered as a \"solution\"?<br />\nOur unchecked population growth means higher social services and<br />\neducational costs, more pollution, more traffic jams, more water shortages,<br />\nreduced farmland, loss of scenic retreats, and other adverse effects on the<br />\nenvironment and our quality of life.<br />\nYet, all levels of government \u2014 federal, state and local \u2014typically avoid<br />\ndealing with rapid population growth. They just try to accommodate the<br />\nincreased numbers of people by attempting to mitigate the side effects.<br />\nCostly, false solutions such as more freeways or massive water projects (e.g.,<br />\nsending polluted Hudson River water to New York City to help \"solve\" its<br />\nwater shortage problems) nearly always make matters worse or merely postpone the day of reckoning. \"Technical fixes\" such as emission control devices<br />\ndo not do the job either.<br />\nIT IS CLEAR THAT OVERPOPULATION IS INCREASINGLY A BASIC CAUSE OF<br />\nOUR SERIOUS AND INTRACTABLE ENVIRONMENTAL,SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC<br />\nPROBLEMS, AND IS THREATENING TO DESTROY THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF<br />\nTHE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY<br />\nFOR MAINTAINING OUR FREE SOCIETY.<br />\nWE MUST ACT NOW TO STABILIZE OUR POPULATION BY DEALING<br />\nDIRECTLY WITH POPULATION INCREASE.<br />\n<br />\nBOX SCORE BY 2020<br />\nThe U.S. will add enough additional population to<br />\ncreate another:<br />\nNew York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Detroit, San Diego, Dallas, San Antonio,<br />\nPhoenix, Baltimore, San Francisco, Indianapolis, San<br />\nJose, Memphis, Washington, Jacksonville, Milwaukee, Boston, Columbus, New Orleans, Cleveland,<br />\nDenver, El Paso and Seattle \u2014 PLUS the next 75<br />\nlargest cities in the U.S.!<br />\n...if we don't act now to stabilize U.S. population!<br />\nWE CANNOT DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE!

Cuts in faculty will not<br />\nnecessarily result in a reduction<br />\nin the number of faculty members<br />\nor in their wages, said Keenan.<br />\nHe suggested replacing older,<br />\nmore highly-paid retiring professors with younger instructors<br />\nso the University could meet<br />\nbudget constraints without<br />\nsacrificing manpower.<br />\nKeenan questioned how a $15<br />\nmillion increase in the roughly<br />\n$100 million total, alreadyexisting endowment could<br />\npossibly sustain the University in<br />\nthe long run.<br />\n\"They assume that after a $15<br />\nmillion increase, [the school ofl<br />\nArts and Sciences will be totally<br />\nself-sufficient forever,\" said<br />\nKeenan. \"The trouble is,<br />\nhistorically, [no one] has been<br />\nterribly enamored with getting<br />\nmoney for Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThis is a major concern.\"<br />\nThe GRO wrote letters to<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller, the Board of Trustees,<br />\nand several administrators, asking them to clearly address these<br />\ntwo questions.<br />\nOther grievances discussed at<br />\nthe forum included the \"absolutely horrific\" state of the library.<br />\nJan Linders, a member of the<br />\nGRO discussion panel, said sarcastically, \"The place is corn-<br />\n<br />\npletely underbooked.\"<br />\nAccording to Keenan, the FiveYear Plan's eight-percent increase of funding to the library<br />\n\"barely keeps it open\" and actually constitutes a cut in real<br />\nterms. Since students from other<br />\ndivisions of Hopkins use the<br />\nlibrary, including the School of<br />\nContinuing Studies and the<br />\nPeabody School of Music, these<br />\ndivisions could contribute to the<br />\ncost of maintaining the library,<br />\nwhich is now funded entirely by<br />\nHomewood divisions.<br />\nAnother concern was the<br />\nreduction of some graduate<br />\nstudents' tuition waiver from<br />\nninety percent to eighty percent,<br />\ndepending on the department and<br />\nhow many years graduates have<br />\nbeen at Hopkins.

What we won't do, in order to<br />\nachieve financial stability, is settle for<br />\nsecond-rate academic activity.<br />\nN-L: In the classroom environment,<br />\nhow might students feel the impact of<br />\nfewer professors and more students<br />\noverall?<br />\nLombardi: That's difficult to say. Our<br />\nestimate is that it should be possible to<br />\nmanage the gradual growth of students and<br />\nthe gradual reduction in faculty size so that<br />\nthere's very small impact on student participation in classrooms.<br />\nWe have to do a better job managing<br />\nstudent-teacher interaction and a better job<br />\nmanaging faculty distribution among the<br />\nstudents. For example, students tell me to-<br />\n<br />\nday that we have classes that are far too<br />\nlarge, with too few professors, and difficulty achieving the kind of schedules<br />\nstudents want.<br />\nConsequently, it isn't a problem of<br />\nfaculty size exactly, because we already<br />\ngot the problem with a large faculty. It's<br />\na problem of the distribution of students<br />\nacross faculty. One of the things Arts and<br />\nSciences has been engaged in is an<br />\nelaborate analysis of its teaching abilities,<br />\ncapacities, and strengths, to try to manage<br />\nthis process better.<br />\nWe believe it is possible that at the end<br />\nof this period we will have a more even<br />\ndistribution of students across our faculty<br />\ntalent, producing a slightly higher average<br />\nstudent-faculty ratio, but a better facultystudent ratio in practice. We hope to even<br />\nthat out through admissions procedures,<br />\nbetter counseling, and better management<br />\nof faculty replacement.<br />\nN-L: Let me pick up on a question [Arts<br />\nand Sciences Dean Lloyd] Armstrong<br />\nwould not discuss when I spoke to him in<br />\nJanuary. Armstrong said that while<br />\ngraduates will teach more courses, they<br />\nwill not replace professors as teachers in<br />\nexisting courses. Will Hopkins, then, call<br />\nupon its eventually smaller corps of professors to teach all courses, thereby potentially increasing some professors' teaching<br />\nloads?<br />\nLombardi: I can't answer that, because<br />\nthat requires a detailed knowledge of how<br />\nArts and Sciences is developing its current<br />\nplan for academics.

The topic was the administration's proposed five-year<br />\nplan. As was perhaps to be expected, most of those present<br />\nwere from the arts rather than the<br />\nsciences. I thought this a great<br />\nshame, for two reasons.<br />\nThe first is that in the long run<br />\nscience grad students have just as<br />\nmuch to lose as we have over in<br />\narts. The second reason is that it<br />\nis in the sciences where most of<br />\nHopkins' foreign grads are concentrated. Foreign students are<br />\ngoing to have particular problems<br />\ncaused by the plan.<br />\nAt the meeting I had intended<br />\nto go through these, but for<br />\nvarious reasons the opportunity<br />\nnever really arose. But also, I<br />\nthought perhaps it was a little<br />\npointless to do so in view of the<br />\ndearth of overseas students present. (There were some, to be<br />\nsure, including the ubiquitous and<br />\nhighly entertaining Jan Linders;<br />\nbut foreign numbers certainly<br />\ncame nowhere near being onethird of the audience, that being<br />\nthe proportion of graduate<br />\nstudents that are foreign on the<br />\nHomewood campus.)<br />\nOverseas students, of which I<br />\nam one, will be hard hit by the<br />\nschool's proposals.

If<br />\nsuch clarity exists how are we to<br />\naccount for the dozens of different Christian sects who<br />\ndisagree on the biblical message?<br />\nIs the Chaplain willing to come<br />\ndown firmly on the side of Leo<br />\n,or Luther?<br />\n\"We need alternative voices to<br />\nlook beyond our accepted<br />\nways. . .to create new truths by<br />\nquestioning the old.\" Despite the<br />\nseemingly oxymoronic use of<br />\n\"new truths,\" I think this<br />\nmessage is clear. Truth, in any<br />\nform is subject to the winds of<br />\nchange. Here endeth the lesson,<br />\nThe sum of two numbers may be<br />\n4 today and 5 tomorrow. There<br />\nare no eternal verities.<br />\nStill, the Chaplain is more than<br />\nwilling to embrace tradition when<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSalle<br />\n<br />\nit suits her: \"the Chaplain's of-.<br />\nfice has traditionally provided a<br />\nforum for. . . positions which<br />\nchallenge accepted truths.\" I ask<br />\nthis cleric to practice what she<br />\npreaches. Dare to break with<br />\ntradition, Chaplain Van Utt, dare<br />\nto dissent from the status quo and<br />\nprovide a forum for accepted<br />\ntruths, such as the inhumanity of<br />\ncommunist regimes and the cruel<br />\nburden of socialist economies,<br />\nand how we might triumph over<br />\nthem. And do not tell me that<br />\n\"we will all be poorer\u2014<br />\nintellectually, morally, and<br />\nspiritually\" if your conception of<br />\na brave new world full of brave<br />\nnew truths goes unheeded. As a<br />\nsage once said, I have God and<br />\nmy father and need little else. As<br />\nfor those who have neither, I will<br />\nshare my boon.<br />\nWhich brings us to the<br />\nChaplain's perception of God,<br />\nmore accurately, of Jesus,<br />\n\"who.. .consistently identified<br />\nwith the poor, the sick, and the<br />\noutcast, not with the rich and<br />\npowerful.\" By and large true:<br />\nblessed are the poor. But the rich<br />\nare not damned\u2014to be kept in<br />\nmind.<br />\nMost offensive and scriptural0<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 MI \u2022<br />\n<br />\nly inaccurate was Van Utt's contention that \"God is not aloof, unbiased or apolitical.\" I am afraid<br />\nto ask with whom He sides. He<br />\nsides with The Poor, I believe is<br />\nwhat the Chaplain would answer.<br />\nAre all the poor in agreement<br />\nwith you? Do they all challenge<br />\nthe accepted truths? Where do<br />\nthose of us who believe in an eternal truth fit into your business?<br />\nOr are the likes of such people expendable to your office?<br />\nAnd so the chaplain used some<br />\ngood rhetoric, some allusions to<br />\nher mission being close to that of<br />\nMoses's, and an ostentatious<br />\nreference to \"the Roman Catholic<br />\nBishops\" (it was the American<br />\nPastoral letter of American<br />\nbishops, not that of a world synod<br />\nas the citation implies). The real<br />\nquestion, which still goes<br />\nunanswered, is why you do not<br />\nmeet all members of the student<br />\nbody half-way. Why do many of<br />\nus feel isolated religiously and<br />\npolitically by your office? I hope<br />\nnext year will bring a better<br />\nanswer than this year, for the<br />\nquestion will not go away.

As I mentioned in the last<br />\nop-ed the News-Letter was kind<br />\nenough to publish, there has been<br />\na tendency, certainly in my<br />\ndepartment (Political Science), to<br />\nhave the less well paid RAs do<br />\nwork such as grading that had<br />\nhitherto been considered the<br />\npreserve of the better paid TAs.<br />\nIn other words, PoliSci is getting<br />\nTAs for RA wages.

The number one rule is:<br />\nGet involved! But, more<br />\nspecifically, there are some things<br />\nyou can keep your ears open for.<br />\nAt the GRO meeting, a suggestion was made that the NewsLetter and the GRONews, or at<br />\nleast the staff thereof, embark on<br />\nsome sort of a collaborative venture. The format\u2014though this<br />\nstill has all to be worked out in<br />\ndetail\u2014would most probably be<br />\na regular half-page, or even a<br />\nwhole page, in the News-Letter<br />\ndevoted to graduate affairs. The<br />\n<br />\nadvantage of this, as opposed to<br />\ncontinuing with the GRONews as<br />\nit stands, is that this way grad<br />\nnews would reach a far greater<br />\naudience, including undergrads,<br />\nwhich we feel would as much as<br />\nanything be a useful facilitator of<br />\nthe breaking down of at least<br />\nsome of the unfortunate barriers<br />\nthat exist between the graduate<br />\nand undergraduate worlds. (No,<br />\nwe're not all pompous intellectual<br />\nsnobs and moral puritans; and no,<br />\nthey're not all shallow, spoiled<br />\npreppies.) However, this project<br />\nwill need hard work on our part:<br />\nserious deadlines, for a start, as<br />\nopposed to the lax regime that existed at the GRONews. We need<br />\nyour help. Give it to us if you<br />\ncan.<br />\nIn the more immediate future,<br />\njust tell all your friends\u2014in and<br />\nout of the school\u2014about what is<br />\ngoing on here. The GRO meeting<br />\nheard suggestions made about<br />\nnext<br />\nperhaps<br />\nsemester<br />\nwithholding grades, refusing to<br />\n<br />\nTA, and generally being a pain.<br />\nOr perhaps sending letters to incoming freshmen, telling them<br />\nwhat to expect.

The ratio of men to<br />\nwomen among professors at<br />\nHopkins, especially in the natural<br />\nsciences and engineering, is but<br />\none example of the sexism that<br />\npersists in our society. This does<br />\nnot refer to hiring practices or<br />\nwage discrimination, it refers to<br />\nthe lack of encouragement of<br />\nwomen to enter traditionally male<br />\nfields. This is the kind of covert<br />\nsexism to which Mr. Rosen is entirely insensitive. The noninclusion of women in his strip<br />\npoints to his lack of regard for the<br />\nproblems women face in trying to<br />\nadvance themselves.<br />\nIt is surprising that Mr. Rosen<br />\ndid not learn to supress his antiquated, prepubescent opinions<br />\nfollowing his Goucher/condom<br />\nstrip which provoked angry letters from both the Hopkins and<br />\nGoucher communities.

It's lack of communication. Communication between the students of all the<br />\ndepartments merely exists. As it<br />\nwas mentioned by some, departments like biology or chemistry<br />\nnever sent a representative to the<br />\nGRO meetings and seem to have<br />\nno interest in the Five-Year Plan<br />\nproblem. It might be true that<br />\nthose students rely on their extensive departmental grants, but<br />\ntheir support is more than<br />\nnecessary. The gap between those<br />\ndepartments and the ones directly affected by the plan has to be<br />\nbridged soon so the graduate student body, united can fullfill its<br />\noptimistic goals.<br />\nStudents in those departments<br />\nwill not be reached by sending a<br />\ndry letter to their mailboxes that<br />\nwill end up in a garbage can.<br />\nThey have to be contacted in person, in their labs, classes, offices,<br />\nby other graduate students, no<br />\nmatter how burdensome this<br />\nmethod may sound.

Monetary prizes for<br />\nwinning banners will be announced during half-time at the<br />\nHopkins-Navy lacrosse game<br />\ntomorrow.<br />\nLater tonight, the Glass<br />\nPavilion will host a Homecoming<br />\nparty. All Hopkins students and<br />\nalumni are invited, and students<br />\nfrom Loyola, Notre Dame,<br />\n<br />\nGoucher, and Towson State can<br />\nattend with a valid student I.D.<br />\nThere will be music, either a D.J.<br />\nband.<br />\na<br />\npossibly,<br />\nor,<br />\n<br />\nRefreshments are available with<br />\nthe usual two I.D.s and light<br />\nnourishment (popcorn) will be<br />\noffered.<br />\n<br />\nOne problem has been the time<br />\nTailgating starts the Saturday<br />\nmorning events.

She likes making<br />\nmusic with them because \"each<br />\ninstrument has a different sound,<br />\neach voice is more individual,<br />\nand you can hear [the different<br />\nqualities] more in a small group.\"<br />\nPineda, who is a biology major at Hopkins, is a newcomer to<br />\nEarly Music. Although she has<br />\nsung in various choirs before, accompaniments played on replica<br />\ninstruments from the Renaissance<br />\nperiod are a new experience.<br />\nNot so for Gail Ellison, whose<br />\nhusband is on the staff at<br />\nHopkins's White House. She has<br />\nmany years' experience with early music consorts on the west<br />\ncoast. Like Pineda, it is the<br />\ncamaraderie and warmth that attracts her to the Peabody<br />\nRenaissance Ensemble, as well as<br />\nthe ability to make a perceptible<br />\ndifference in the sound of the<br />\ngroup.<br />\nPineda and Ellison will join<br />\nseven other singers and fifteen instrumentalists for the Ensemble's<br />\nHopkins debut this Sunday at the<br />\nGlass Pavilion in a program of<br />\n\"Musica<br />\nTransalpina,\"\u2014<br />\nliterally, music from across the<br />\nAlps. Director Mark Cudek has<br />\nchosen a variety of instrumental<br />\nand vocal pieces that link the<br />\nItalian Renaissance with English<br />\nmusic.<br />\n\"In Elizabethan England,<br />\nanything Italian was in vogue, it<br />\nwas really the rage.\" Cudek<br />\nperused a registry from 1590 and<br />\nfound that Italian musicians outnumbered native-born musicians<br />\n2 to 1 at the Queen's court. An<br />\n<br />\nadditional discovery of a 1588<br />\ncollection of Italian madrigals<br />\nwith English texts gave him the<br />\nidea for Sunday's concert.<br />\n\"This is an anthology type of<br />\nprogram. We're trying to represent every conceivable style of<br />\nplaying (and singing) that would<br />\nhave been done at the court as we<br />\ncan.\" There will be lute solos as<br />\nwell as various combinations of<br />\nvoices, viols, recorders, krummhorns, Renaissance guitar<br />\nharpsichord and cittern (a banjolike instrument). Some songs and<br />\ndance tunes will be presented in<br />\nthe original Italian versions<br />\nalongside of later English pieces<br />\nderived from them.<br />\nThe assortment of facsimile instruments will be played by<br />\nPeabody students, most of whom<br />\nare more accustomed to performing on the modern cello, flute,<br />\nor bassoon.

She feels that<br />\nlearning the ornamentation and<br />\nperformance<br />\npractice<br />\nof<br />\nRenaissance wind instruments has<br />\nenhanced her musicianship. She<br />\nwas also anxious to get other conservatory students involved<br />\nbecause it would give them a<br />\nchance to explore music outside<br />\nthe repertoire they usually study.<br />\nFor Mark Kausch, a Peabody<br />\ngraduate who now works at<br />\nWJHU, learning to play the viol<br />\nda gamba (a tenor viola that looks<br />\nsomewhat like a small cello) was<br />\na matter of survival. As a double<br />\nbass player, he didn't have many<br />\nopportunities to participate in<br />\n<br />\nchamber music, a typical way that<br />\norchestral musicians supplement<br />\ntheir income.

Cudek himself will<br />\nperform on the cittern, the lute,<br />\n<br />\nand the viol da gamba, as well as<br />\nsing in several madrigals. With<br />\nsmall groups, he says, you have<br />\nto play whatever is needed.<br />\nWhile the Peabody Renaissance<br />\nEnsemble is the newest addition<br />\nto the Conservatory's early music<br />\nofferings, Cudek has made an effort to open membership to the<br />\nHopkins community. \"There's a<br />\nlot of interest in this music(on the<br />\nHomewood campus). . .I see<br />\nsigns up there about various small<br />\n<br />\ngroup rehearsals often.\" One of<br />\nthe enduring attractions about the<br />\ntype of music which will be performed Sunday is its accessibility to non-musicians and its simple beauty.<br />\nThe Peabody Renaissance<br />\nEnsemble will perform on Sunday, April 30, at 4 p.m. in the<br />\nGlass Pavillion.

Sustained pianissimo notes played by<br />\nthe basses and violas and a conflict of major and minor intervals<br />\nbetween percussion and strings<br />\ncreated an aura of suspense and<br />\ndrama, while layer upon layer of<br />\nsound was added at an excruciatingly slow pace.

Contrastingly, in<br />\nOttorino Respighi's \"Roman<br />\nFestivals,\" he introduced several<br />\ninnovative ideas that made one<br />\ncurious as to what he would have<br />\ndone with an even more substantial work.<br />\nOne of these innovations was to<br />\nplace the offstage trumpets that<br />\nannounce the Roman Circus<br />\ndepicted in the work at the back<br />\nof the auditorium. Putting musicians in locations remote to the<br />\nstage has become somewhat<br />\ncliche, but in this case it served<br />\nto enhance the descriptive<br />\ncharacter of \"Festivals,\" immersing the audience in a jumble of<br />\ncircus-like sounds.<br />\nThere were also several<br />\nsublime moments of transition<br />\nbetween the sections, where an<br />\noften bombastic and obvious<br />\npiece of music was enhanced with<br />\ntaste and refinement. Although<br />\nDePreist projected a clear artistic<br />\nconcept of each of the works on<br />\nthe program, the orchestra did not<br />\nalways respond to his direction.<br />\nMost obvious among these<br />\ndisappointing instances was an<br />\noverpronounced brass entrance in<br />\nRachmaninoff's \"First Piano<br />\nConcerto.\" Pianist Garrick<br />\nOhlsson played the lush and<br />\nromantic concerto expressively,<br />\nwith passion, and with the sense<br />\nof mastery it requires.

Bolognesi of the Duke<br />\nUniversity Medical Center<br />\npresented the latest- research on<br />\nAIDS vaccines. Dr. Bolognesi<br />\nbegan by outlining the progress<br />\nthat medical researchers have<br />\nmade since the first clinical<br />\ndescription of AIDS in 1981.<br />\nSince then, the virus responsible<br />\nfor AIDS has been isolated,<br />\ndiagnostic tests have been<br />\ndeveloped, a method for screening the nation's blood supply has<br />\nbeen implemented, and an ex-<br />\n<br />\nperimental drug(AZT)is now being used in clinical practice.<br />\nAt one time, scientists thought<br />\nthat vaccines were ineffective<br />\nagainst retroviruses like HIV.<br />\nSince then, however, researchers<br />\nhave been able to develop vaccines against subunits of the<br />\nglycoprotein outer layers of some<br />\nviruses. These subunit vaccines<br />\nhave been able to protect mice<br />\nfrom certain diseases until they<br />\nbecome old and their immune<br />\nsystems break down. Although<br />\nthis news sounds encouraging,<br />\nthere are still many problems fac-<br />\n<br />\ning medical scientists. The AIDS<br />\nvirus is a memtser of the class of<br />\nviruses called lentiviurses and no<br />\nvaccine ever developed has been<br />\nfound to be effective against any<br />\nof the lentiviuses. In addition, the<br />\nAIDS virus attacks the immune<br />\nsystem, which is the body's only<br />\nprotection against infection. The<br />\nAIDS virus mutates rapidly so<br />\nafter a short while the only<br />\nviruses left in the body are the<br />\nmutants that the immune system<br />\nwas incapable of killing in the<br />\nfirst place. As a result of the<br />\nmutations, any experimental cure<br />\n<br />\nis likely to be effective against only a small percentage of the<br />\nviruses and will therefore be<br />\nlargely ineffective. Because of all<br />\nthese complications, scientists<br />\nhave not yet been able to develop<br />\nan experimental vaccine,.<br />\nRight now, scientists are trying<br />\nto understand the relationship between the delayed onset of AIDS<br />\nand the body's immune response.<br />\nPerhaps the immune system is<br />\nable to protect the body for a<br />\nshort period of time; or perhaps<br />\nsome part of the immune<br />\nresponse actually triggers AIDS.<br />\n<br />\n\f24/APRIL 28, 1989<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nHopkins holds off late Maryland rally for 10-9 win<br />\nRzempoluch captures finalfaceoff to seal 17th consecutive regular season victory<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\n<br />\nMaryland 18-5.

Hire a full-time soccer<br />\ncoach. It's not like we're talking<br />\nabout basket-weaving here. Soccer is fast becoming one of the<br />\nmost popular sports among the<br />\nyouth of America, and the Johns<br />\nHopkins program is attracting<br />\nsome top-notch players. They've<br />\nbeen one of the top teams in the<br />\nMAC during the past four years<br />\nand are always in contention for<br />\nan NCAA Tournament bid.<br />\nplayers of their caliber deserve a<br />\nfull-time coach of the same<br />\ncaliber. Hopkins has the potential<br />\nto be one of the top Division III<br />\nteams in the nation, and I would<br />\nhate to see them waste that<br />\nchance.<br />\n2. Improve the outdoor<br />\nfacilities. Both the baseball field<br />\nand the lower practice field need<br />\na great deal of improvement, and<br />\neveryone knows it. It's getting to<br />\nthe point where people are going<br />\nto start getting seriously injured<br />\nunless something is done. What<br />\nI would propose is building a new<br />\nbaseball field. I don't know<br />\nwhere you'd find the space, but<br />\nwhen you have a team that is one<br />\nof the finest in Division III, I<br />\nthink they deserve a much better<br />\nplaying field.

Time has passed, and the principals are<br />\ndoing fine. Steven has long since retired, and at 94 is still<br />\nin the prime ofhealth. Derek is a senior at The Nabisco Johns<br />\nHopkins University (corporate takeover), majoring in biologyclassics-economics-philosophy (the departments were combined in 1993 under a forgotten document once known as<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan), while Catherine is a freshman at<br />\nHonda Harvard University (nothing's sacred).<br />\nDerek is a three-time All-American shuffleboard player,<br />\nhaving led N-JHU to three straight NCAA titles. The University took up shuffleboard after cancelling its lacrosse program in 2013 when,for a lack ofspace, it built on Homewood<br />\nField the new International Studies Lab, temporarily named<br />\nBuilding Cfor lack ofa benefactor. The building serves the<br />\n4,900 undergraduates and nine professors in that major. We<br />\nfind Derek returning from shuffleboard practice, as Steven<br />\nlolls in his easy chair in his study. Why Derek still lives with<br />\nSteven is beyond me. However, Derek, still in his youthful<br />\nglory, has become a little dense.<br />\n\"How was practice today?\" asked Steven.<br />\n\"Like excellently mondorific, man!\" exclaimed Derek in<br />\nhis husky voice. \"Like, totally terminal!\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Speak English, will ya?\" asked Steven, impatiently.<br />\n\"Don't they teach you English?\"<br />\n\"Like, I don't know, maybe. The professors, y'know, like<br />\nthey drive us wacko bananas, man. They were TAs in your<br />\nday, but like they can't speak diddly even now.\"<br />\nSteven shook his head. \"And they certainly seem to rub \u2022<br />\noff on their students, \" he said. \"I don't know, this<br />\ncountry\u2014well, look, we've had six so-called \"Education<br />\nPresidents\" in a row, from George Bush to Bill Bradley, 1<br />\nJohn Denver, Michael Jordan, Margo Adams, and now<br />\nMalcolm Jamal-Warner, and I'll be darned if any of them<br />\ndid anything for American education. Take someone like Jon<br />\nStempel, now he had possibilities.\"<br />\n\"Like, you mean our mailman?\"<br />\n\"Yes. He came from a time when education had a future. I<br />\nHe was like you\u2014did his work, had friends, enjoyed an<br />\nOrioles game at Memorial Stadium now and then .. \"<br />\n\"You mean where they teach Microeconomics now,\"in- 1<br />\nquired Derek.<br />\n\"Right. He was news editor at the News-Letter for a couple of years, and was even the QM about half the time in<br />\nhis senior year. His head was screwed on right.\"<br />\n\"So like why is he only a mailman?\"<br />\n\"Oh, I don't know. He got through law school, and then,<br />\nI don't know, something must have happened. But he's in<br />\nhis fifties somewhere and he seems happy.\"<br />\n\"Well, that's good.\"<br />\n\"But you got me thinking,\"said Steven. \"I remember 1<br />\nwhen shaking his classmates' hands at graduation back in, 1<br />\nwhat was it, 1989, that his class had some future. But that<br />\nwas then. Everyone gets lost now. I think President<br />\nGiangiulio is expanding Hopkins too much. Look, he has<br />\n200,000 students in 216 divisions in 187 countries, including<br />\n25 that don't even exist. Too much.\"<br />\n\"Like, but I thought overexpansion was your legacy, Uncle Steve.\"<br />\nSteven turned his head, seeking to avoid the subject. \"Uh,<br />\nwhy don't you do your homework, Derek?\"<br />\n\"There's none.

The U.S. has the fastest growing population of any<br />\ncountry in the industrialized Western World \u2014 approaching<br />\n3,000,000 per year!<br />\n2. In the next 31 years, by the year 2020,if current trends<br />\ncontinue, today's U.S. population of 247 million will<br />\nincrease to nearly 300 million and continue to grow \u2014 we<br />\nwill add two and a half times more people than the rest of<br />\nthe industrialized western countries combined.<br /><br />\n3. Last<br /><br />\nyear alone, California's population grew by<br />\n662,000 people \u2014that's almost equivalent to adding<br />\nanother San Francisco every 12 months. And does Boston<br />\nneed more people when its landfills are already closing<br />\nand ocean dumping is being considered as a \"solution\"?<br />\nOur unchecked population growth means higher social services and<br />\neducational costs, more pollution, more traffic jams, more water shortages,<br />\nreduced farmland, loss of scenic retreats, and other adverse effects on the<br />\nenvironment and our quality of life.<br />\nYet, all levels of government \u2014 federal, state and local \u2014typically avoid<br />\ndealing with rapid population growth. They just try to accommodate the<br />\nincreased numbers of people by attempting to mitigate the side effects.<br />\nCostly, false solutions such as more freeways or massive water projects (e.g.,<br />\nsending polluted Hudson River water to New York City to help \"solve\" its<br />\nwater shortage problems) nearly always make matters worse or merely postpone the day of reckoning. \"Technical fixes\" such as emission control devices<br />\ndo not do the job either.<br />\nIT IS CLEAR THAT OVERPOPULATION IS INCREASINGLY A BASIC CAUSE OF<br />\nOUR SERIOUS AND INTRACTABLE ENVIRONMENTAL,SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC<br />\nPROBLEMS, AND IS THREATENING TO DESTROY THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF<br />\nTHE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY<br />\nFOR MAINTAINING OUR FREE SOCIETY.<br />\nWE MUST ACT NOW TO STABILIZE OUR POPULATION BY DEALING<br />\nDIRECTLY WITH POPULATION INCREASE.<br /><br />\nBOX SCORE BY 2020<br />\nThe U.S. will add enough additional population to<br />\ncreate another:<br />\nNew York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Detroit, San Diego, Dallas, San Antonio,<br />\nPhoenix, Baltimore, San Francisco, Indianapolis, San<br />\nJose, Memphis, Washington, Jacksonville, Milwaukee, Boston, Columbus, New Orleans, Cleveland,<br />\nDenver, El Paso and Seattle \u2014 PLUS the next 75<br />\nlargest cities in the U.S.!<br />\n...if we don't act now to stabilize U.S. population!<br />\nWE CANNOT DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE!

Since students from other<br />\ndivisions of Hopkins use the<br />\nlibrary, including the School of<br />\nContinuing Studies and the<br />\nPeabody School of Music, these<br />\ndivisions could contribute to the<br />\ncost of maintaining the library,<br />\nwhich is now funded entirely by<br />\nHomewood divisions.<br />\nAnother concern was the<br />\nreduction of some graduate<br />\nstudents' tuition waiver from<br />\nninety percent to eighty percent,<br />\ndepending on the department and<br />\nhow many years graduates have<br />\nbeen at Hopkins.

But the financial part<br />\nis required for the academic part to take<br />\nplace. If we don't create a solid financial<br />\nbase, we will not be able to sustain the<br />\nacademic part. The key activity that involves finances is to try to construct a<br />\nfinancial base that will sustain the kind of<br />\nexcellence in academics that we want to<br />\npursue. What we won't do, in order to<br />\nachieve financial stability, is settle for<br />\nsecond-rate academic activity.<br />\nN-L: In the classroom environment,<br />\nhow might students feel the impact of<br />\nfewer professors and more students<br />\noverall?<br />\nLombardi: That's difficult to say. Our<br />\nestimate is that it should be possible to<br />\nmanage the gradual growth of students and<br />\nthe gradual reduction in faculty size so that<br />\nthere's very small impact on student participation in classrooms.<br />\nWe have to do a better job managing<br />\nstudent-teacher interaction and a better job<br />\nmanaging faculty distribution among the<br />\nstudents. For example, students tell me to-<br /><br />\nday that we have classes that are far too<br />\nlarge, with too few professors, and difficulty achieving the kind of schedules<br />\nstudents want.<br />\nConsequently, it isn't a problem of<br />\nfaculty size exactly, because we already<br />\ngot the problem with a large faculty. It's<br />\na problem of the distribution of students<br />\nacross faculty. One of the things Arts and<br />\nSciences has been engaged in is an<br />\nelaborate analysis of its teaching abilities,<br />\ncapacities, and strengths, to try to manage<br />\nthis process better.<br />\nWe believe it is possible that at the end<br />\nof this period we will have a more even<br />\ndistribution of students across our faculty<br />\ntalent, producing a slightly higher average<br />\nstudent-faculty ratio, but a better facultystudent ratio in practice.

Will Hopkins, then, call<br />\nupon its eventually smaller corps of professors to teach all courses, thereby potentially increasing some professors' teaching<br />\nloads?<br />\nLombardi: I can't answer that, because<br />\nthat requires a detailed knowledge of how<br />\nArts and Sciences is developing its current<br />\nplan for academics.

The topic was the administration's proposed five-year<br />\nplan. As was perhaps to be expected, most of those present<br />\nwere from the arts rather than the<br />\nsciences. I thought this a great<br />\nshame, for two reasons.<br />\nThe first is that in the long run<br />\nscience grad students have just as<br />\nmuch to lose as we have over in<br />\narts. The second reason is that it<br />\nis in the sciences where most of<br />\nHopkins' foreign grads are concentrated. Foreign students are<br />\ngoing to have particular problems<br />\ncaused by the plan.<br />\nAt the meeting I had intended<br />\nto go through these, but for<br />\nvarious reasons the opportunity<br />\nnever really arose. But also, I<br />\nthought perhaps it was a little<br />\npointless to do so in view of the<br />\ndearth of overseas students present. (There were some, to be<br />\nsure, including the ubiquitous and<br />\nhighly entertaining Jan Linders;<br />\nbut foreign numbers certainly<br />\ncame nowhere near being onethird of the audience, that being<br />\nthe proportion of graduate<br />\nstudents that are foreign on the<br />\nHomewood campus.)<br />\nOverseas students, of which I<br />\nam one, will be hard hit by the<br />\nschool's proposals.

Last week she discussed her views and the result is<br />\nscary. They are anything but<br />\nopen-minded, and in places<br />\ndownright muddled.<br />\n\"The message of the Bible is<br />\nclear,\" she announced, assuming<br />\ninsight of historic proportions. If<br />\nsuch clarity exists how are we to<br />\naccount for the dozens of different Christian sects who<br />\ndisagree on the biblical message?<br />\nIs the Chaplain willing to come<br />\ndown firmly on the side of Leo<br />\n,or Luther?<br />\n\"We need alternative voices to<br />\nlook beyond our accepted<br />\nways. . .to create new truths by<br />\nquestioning the old.\" Despite the<br />\nseemingly oxymoronic use of<br />\n\"new truths,\" I think this<br />\nmessage is clear. Truth, in any<br />\nform is subject to the winds of<br />\nchange. Here endeth the lesson,<br />\nThe sum of two numbers may be<br />\n4 today and 5 tomorrow. There<br />\nare no eternal verities.<br />\nStill, the Chaplain is more than<br />\nwilling to embrace tradition when<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nSalle<br /><br />\nit suits her: \"the Chaplain's of-.<br />\nfice has traditionally provided a<br />\nforum for. . . positions which<br />\nchallenge accepted truths.\" I ask<br />\nthis cleric to practice what she<br />\npreaches. Dare to break with<br />\ntradition, Chaplain Van Utt, dare<br />\nto dissent from the status quo and<br />\nprovide a forum for accepted<br />\ntruths, such as the inhumanity of<br />\ncommunist regimes and the cruel<br />\nburden of socialist economies,<br />\nand how we might triumph over<br />\nthem. And do not tell me that<br />\n\"we will all be poorer\u2014<br />\nintellectually, morally, and<br />\nspiritually\" if your conception of<br />\na brave new world full of brave<br />\nnew truths goes unheeded. As a<br />\nsage once said, I have God and<br />\nmy father and need little else. As<br />\nfor those who have neither, I will<br />\nshare my boon.<br />\nWhich brings us to the<br />\nChaplain's perception of God,<br />\nmore accurately, of Jesus,<br />\n\"who.. .consistently identified<br />\nwith the poor, the sick, and the<br />\noutcast, not with the rich and<br />\npowerful.\" By and large true:<br />\nblessed are the poor.

He<br />\nsides with The Poor, I believe is<br />\nwhat the Chaplain would answer.<br />\nAre all the poor in agreement<br />\nwith you? Do they all challenge<br />\nthe accepted truths? Where do<br />\nthose of us who believe in an eternal truth fit into your business?<br />\nOr are the likes of such people expendable to your office?<br />\nAnd so the chaplain used some<br />\ngood rhetoric, some allusions to<br />\nher mission being close to that of<br />\nMoses's, and an ostentatious<br />\nreference to \"the Roman Catholic<br />\nBishops\" (it was the American<br />\nPastoral letter of American<br />\nbishops, not that of a world synod<br />\nas the citation implies). The real<br />\nquestion, which still goes<br />\nunanswered, is why you do not<br />\nmeet all members of the student<br />\nbody half-way.

The ratio of men to<br />\nwomen among professors at<br />\nHopkins, especially in the natural<br />\nsciences and engineering, is but<br />\none example of the sexism that<br />\npersists in our society. This does<br />\nnot refer to hiring practices or<br />\nwage discrimination, it refers to<br />\nthe lack of encouragement of<br />\nwomen to enter traditionally male<br />\nfields. This is the kind of covert<br />\nsexism to which Mr. Rosen is entirely insensitive.

It's lack of communication. Communication between the students of all the<br />\ndepartments merely exists.

There will<br />\nbe a variety of activities this<br />\nweekend celebrating Homecoming that are geared towards<br />\nstudents.<br />\nIn the past, the focus was mainly on alumni, while students looked at Homecoming as just a<br />\nlacrosse game. Assistant Director<br />\nof Alumni Affairs Doug Warren<br />\nand juniors Ian Steinberg and<br />\nDenise Mo have worked on the<br />\nHomecoming events, the theme,<br />\nand trying to involve more<br />\nstudents in the traditionally<br />\nalumni-oriented programs.<br />\n\"We're trying to make the entire weekend into a tradition,\"<br />\nSteinberg commented as he<br /><br />\noutlined some of the events of the<br />\nweekend.<br />\nStarting tonight, the semester's<br />\nfinal Hoppy Hour, co-sponsored<br />\nby Homecoming and APTT, will<br />\nincorporate the Homecoming<br />\ntheme, \"Go Hopkins Beat<br />\nNavy.\" Banners created by<br />\norganizations, clubs, and classes<br />\nwill be hung around the Glass<br />\nPavilion and judged during Hoppy Hour.

She likes making<br />\nmusic with them because \"each<br />\ninstrument has a different sound,<br />\neach voice is more individual,<br />\nand you can hear [the different<br />\nqualities] more in a small group.\"<br />\nPineda, who is a biology major at Hopkins, is a newcomer to<br />\nEarly Music. Although she has<br />\nsung in various choirs before, accompaniments played on replica<br />\ninstruments from the Renaissance<br />\nperiod are a new experience.<br />\nNot so for Gail Ellison, whose<br />\nhusband is on the staff at<br />\nHopkins's White House. She has<br />\nmany years' experience with early music consorts on the west<br />\ncoast. Like Pineda, it is the<br />\ncamaraderie and warmth that attracts her to the Peabody<br />\nRenaissance Ensemble, as well as<br />\nthe ability to make a perceptible<br />\ndifference in the sound of the<br />\ngroup.<br />\nPineda and Ellison will join<br />\nseven other singers and fifteen instrumentalists for the Ensemble's<br />\nHopkins debut this Sunday at the<br />\nGlass Pavilion in a program of<br />\n\"Musica<br />\nTransalpina,\"\u2014<br />\nliterally, music from across the<br />\nAlps.

An<br /><br />\nadditional discovery of a 1588<br />\ncollection of Italian madrigals<br />\nwith English texts gave him the<br />\nidea for Sunday's concert.<br />\n\"This is an anthology type of<br />\nprogram. We're trying to represent every conceivable style of<br />\nplaying (and singing) that would<br />\nhave been done at the court as we<br />\ncan.\" There will be lute solos as<br />\nwell as various combinations of<br />\nvoices, viols, recorders, krummhorns, Renaissance guitar<br />\nharpsichord and cittern (a banjolike instrument). Some songs and<br />\ndance tunes will be presented in<br />\nthe original Italian versions<br />\nalongside of later English pieces<br />\nderived from them.<br />\nThe assortment of facsimile instruments will be played by<br />\nPeabody students, most of whom<br />\nare more accustomed to performing on the modern cello, flute,<br />\nor bassoon.

Bolognesi of the Duke<br />\nUniversity Medical Center<br />\npresented the latest- research on<br />\nAIDS vaccines. Dr. Bolognesi<br />\nbegan by outlining the progress<br />\nthat medical researchers have<br />\nmade since the first clinical<br />\ndescription of AIDS in 1981.<br />\nSince then, the virus responsible<br />\nfor AIDS has been isolated,<br />\ndiagnostic tests have been<br />\ndeveloped, a method for screening the nation's blood supply has<br />\nbeen implemented, and an ex-<br /><br />\nperimental drug(AZT)is now being used in clinical practice.<br />\nAt one time, scientists thought<br />\nthat vaccines were ineffective<br />\nagainst retroviruses like HIV.<br />\nSince then, however, researchers<br />\nhave been able to develop vaccines against subunits of the<br />\nglycoprotein outer layers of some<br />\nviruses. These subunit vaccines<br />\nhave been able to protect mice<br />\nfrom certain diseases until they<br />\nbecome old and their immune<br />\nsystems break down. Although<br />\nthis news sounds encouraging,<br />\nthere are still many problems fac-<br /><br />\ning medical scientists. The AIDS<br />\nvirus is a memtser of the class of<br />\nviruses called lentiviurses and no<br />\nvaccine ever developed has been<br />\nfound to be effective against any<br />\nof the lentiviuses. In addition, the<br />\nAIDS virus attacks the immune<br />\nsystem, which is the body's only<br />\nprotection against infection. The<br />\nAIDS virus mutates rapidly so<br />\nafter a short while the only<br />\nviruses left in the body are the<br />\nmutants that the immune system<br />\nwas incapable of killing in the<br />\nfirst place. As a result of the<br />\nmutations, any experimental cure<br /><br />\nis likely to be effective against only a small percentage of the<br />\nviruses and will therefore be<br />\nlargely ineffective. Because of all<br />\nthese complications, scientists<br />\nhave not yet been able to develop<br />\nan experimental vaccine,.<br />\nRight now, scientists are trying<br />\nto understand the relationship between the delayed onset of AIDS<br />\nand the body's immune response.<br />\nPerhaps the immune system is<br />\nable to protect the body for a<br />\nshort period of time; or perhaps<br />\nsome part of the immune<br />\nresponse actually triggers AIDS.<br /><br />\n24/APRIL 28, 1989<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nHopkins holds off late Maryland rally for 10-9 win<br />\nRzempoluch captures finalfaceoff to seal 17th consecutive regular season victory<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br /><br />\nMaryland 18-5.

There were<br />\ntwo meets: a home tri-meet last<br />\nSaturday against Swarthmore and<br />\nMessiah, and an away dual meet<br />\nagainst Gettysburg on Wednesday. Last Saturday's meet was a<br />\nbit encouraging because both<br />\nteams were strong competitors<br />\nand Hopkins did not get<br />\ndestroyed. In fact, the Jays tied<br />\nSwarthmore for second. The final<br /><br />\nscores were Messiah 92, Swarthmore 43, and Hopkins 43. The<br />\nindividual standout perforniances<br />\nat this meet were Manny Hostin<br />\nin the 800m, Glenn Sabin in the<br />\nShot Put, and Max Psolka in the<br />\nTriple Jump.

Max<br />\nPsolka and Eric Hastings each put<br />\non a show in versatility, as Psolka<br />\nscored in four events and<br />\nHastings in five.<br />\nThe Wednesday meet at Gettysburg was not as good for the<br />\nJays. It would be better described as the Wednesday<br />\nmassacre rather than meet. The<br />\nfinal score was Gettysburg 101,<br />\nHopkins 36. However, the team<br />\ndid not take several of its best<br />\ncompetitors. Max Psolka led the<br />\nindividual performances once<br />\nagain as he secured two first<br />\nplaces in the Javelin and Triple<br />\nJump, and a second place in the<br />\nHigh Jump. Matt Hannon also<br />\ncontributed to scoring in three<br />\nevents as he got two second place<br />\nfinishes in the 110m and 400m<br />\nhurdles. Matt also ran a leg of the<br /><br />\n1500m relay that got a first.<br />\nGlenn Sabin scored second in the<br />\nShot Put and Discus.

Hire a full-time soccer<br />\ncoach. It's not like we're talking<br />\nabout basket-weaving here. Soccer is fast becoming one of the<br />\nmost popular sports among the<br />\nyouth of America, and the Johns<br />\nHopkins program is attracting<br />\nsome top-notch players. They've<br />\nbeen one of the top teams in the<br />\nMAC during the past four years<br />\nand are always in contention for<br />\nan NCAA Tournament bid.<br />\nplayers of their caliber deserve a<br />\nfull-time coach of the same<br />\ncaliber. Hopkins has the potential<br />\nto be one of the top Division III<br />\nteams in the nation, and I would<br />\nhate to see them waste that<br />\nchance.<br />\n2. Improve the outdoor<br />\nfacilities. Both the baseball field<br />\nand the lower practice field need<br />\na great deal of improvement, and<br />\neveryone knows it. It's getting to<br />\nthe point where people are going<br />\nto start getting seriously injured<br />\nunless something is done. What<br />\nI would propose is building a new<br />\nbaseball field. I don't know<br />\nwhere you'd find the space, but<br />\nwhen you have a team that is one<br />\nof the finest in Division III, I<br />\nthink they deserve a much better<br />\nplaying field. After that is done,<br />\nturn the present baseball field into a grass practice field.<br />\n3. Make a serious commitment<br />\nto improving the football program.

I.<br />\nrealize that money is tight, but<br />\nwhen you have hockey players<br />\nshelling out over a hundred<br />\ndollars apiece each year just to ge<br />\nice time, something must b<br />\ndone. The Athletic Department,<br />\nat the very least, should insure<br />\nthat club teams have adequate an\u2022<br />\ninexpensive practice facilities.<br />\nI know that there's not enough<br />\nmoney to accomplish all of these<br />\ngoals, but hopefully plans can be<br />\nmade so that improvements are<br />\nmade in the near future.<br />\nIn closing, though, I believe the<br />\nAthletic Department runs extremely well under Mr. Scott.<br />\nPersonally, I would like to thank<br />\nTom Calder and everyone in<br />\nSports Information for making<br />\nmy job a lot easier this year. I<br />\nwould also like to thank all of the<br />\ncoaches for supplying information and willingly answering<br />\nquestions during the year. Having said that, I leave the sports<br />\nsection in the capable hands of<br />\nRachel McGuckian and Josh<br />\nOrenstein.

As things would have it, there have been<br />\n2 QMs!(O000! Feel the earth shake!) I, the more hip, obnoxious, and generally offensive QM , am responsible for<br />\nall the humor of the past.

Time has passed, and the principals are<br />\ndoing fine. Steven has long since retired, and at 94 is still<br />\nin the prime ofhealth. Derek is a senior at The Nabisco Johns<br />\nHopkins University (corporate takeover), majoring in biologyclassics-economics-philosophy (the departments were combined in 1993 under a forgotten document once known as<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan), while Catherine is a freshman at<br />\nHonda Harvard University (nothing's sacred).<br />\nDerek is a three-time All-American shuffleboard player,<br />\nhaving led N-JHU to three straight NCAA titles. The University took up shuffleboard after cancelling its lacrosse program in 2013 when,for a lack ofspace, it built on Homewood<br />\nField the new International Studies Lab, temporarily named<br />\nBuilding Cfor lack ofa benefactor. The building serves the<br />\n4,900 undergraduates and nine professors in that major. We<br />\nfind Derek returning from shuffleboard practice, as Steven<br />\nlolls in his easy chair in his study. Why Derek still lives with<br />\nSteven is beyond me. However, Derek, still in his youthful<br />\nglory, has become a little dense.<br />\n\"How was practice today?\" asked Steven.<br />\n\"Like excellently mondorific, man!\" exclaimed Derek in<br />\nhis husky voice. \"Like, totally terminal!\"<br /><br />\n\"Speak English, will ya?\" asked Steven, impatiently.<br />\n\"Don't they teach you English?\"<br />\n\"Like, I don't know, maybe. The professors, y'know, like<br />\nthey drive us wacko bananas, man. They were TAs in your<br />\nday, but like they can't speak diddly even now.\"<br />\nSteven shook his head. \"And they certainly seem to rub \u2022<br />\noff on their students, \" he said. \"I don't know, this<br />\ncountry\u2014well, look, we've had six so-called \"Education<br />\nPresidents\" in a row, from George Bush to Bill Bradley, 1<br />\nJohn Denver, Michael Jordan, Margo Adams, and now<br />\nMalcolm Jamal-Warner, and I'll be darned if any of them<br />\ndid anything for American education. Take someone like Jon<br />\nStempel, now he had possibilities.\"<br />\n\"Like, you mean our mailman?\"<br />\n\"Yes. He came from a time when education had a future. I<br />\nHe was like you\u2014did his work, had friends, enjoyed an<br />\nOrioles game at Memorial Stadium now and then .. \"<br />\n\"You mean where they teach Microeconomics now,\"in- 1<br />\nquired Derek.<br />\n\"Right. He was news editor at the News-Letter for a couple of years, and was even the QM about half the time in<br />\nhis senior year. His head was screwed on right.\"<br />\n\"So like why is he only a mailman?\"<br />\n\"Oh, I don't know. He got through law school, and then,<br />\nI don't know, something must have happened. But he's in<br />\nhis fifties somewhere and he seems happy.\"<br />\n\"Well, that's good.\"<br />\n\"But you got me thinking,\"said Steven. \"I remember 1<br />\nwhen shaking his classmates' hands at graduation back in, 1<br />\nwhat was it, 1989, that his class had some future. But that<br />\nwas then. Everyone gets lost now. I think President<br />\nGiangiulio is expanding Hopkins too much. Look, he has<br />\n200,000 students in 216 divisions in 187 countries, including<br />\n25 that don't even exist. Too much.\"<br />\n\"Like, but I thought overexpansion was your legacy, Uncle Steve.\"<br />\nSteven turned his head, seeking to avoid the subject. \"Uh,<br />\nwhy don't you do your homework, Derek?\"<br />\n\"There's none. Like I senior-optioned everything.\"<br />\n\"Then relax and enjoy yourself. You're a senior, you've<br />\nearned it.\"<br />\n\"Gotcha.\"<br /><br />\nammo;<br /><br />\n\u2022* \u2014 *\u2022<br /><br />\nAn,<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOJES<br />\nSenior night at the Grad Club! 50<br />\ncents domestics, 30 cents 7oz.
