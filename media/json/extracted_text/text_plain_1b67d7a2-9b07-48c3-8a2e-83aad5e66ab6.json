President Gilman made<br />\nthe introductory address and spoke of the revival of interest in public speaking and of its<br />\nimportance to the college man.<br />\nDean Griffin delivered the caution to the<br />\nfreshman aspirants for honor in public speaking, who were divided into two sections. In<br />\nthe first section D. M. Liddell spoke on \"Our<br />\n<br />\nNational Defense, the Citizen Soldier,\" while<br />\nA. V. A. Schermerhorn delivered a \"Speech<br />\nof Patrick Henry in 1775.\" The men and subjects in the second section were : Frederick<br />\nFoster, \"Our Relations With England in<br />\n1824\" ; W. P. Shriver, \"Centennial Address,\" and Herbert Kaufman, \"Universal<br />\nEmancipation.\" Professors Griffin, Greene<br />\nand Smith were judges of the speaking, and<br />\nawarded the prizes to Mr. Liddell and Mr.<br />\nKaufman.<br />\nThe main event of the evening was the debate between the classes of '98 and '99, over<br />\nwhich Mr. Lee presided. The question was :<br />\n\"Shall Immigration to This Country be Further Restricted ?\" Professor Adams warned<br />\nthe \" populace\" not to disturb the speakers,<br />\nwhom he especially urged to be \"persuasive.\"<br />\nHe cautioned the debaters to \"begin slow,<br />\nspeak low, rise higher ; take fire.\" The debate<br />\nwas then opened by Mr. J. N. Ulman, who<br />\neloquently presented arguments for the affirmative. He was followed by Mr. C. M. Guggenheimer, who spoke effectively for the negative. The convincing arguments which Mr.<br />\nC. M. Stearns coolly delivered were warmly<br />\nanswered by Mr. P. S. Morgan. Mr. Z. M.<br />\nBallard summed up the points made by the<br />\nseniors in a sarcastic address, which caused<br />\nconsiderable merriment. The debate was ably<br />\nclosed by Mr. J. C. French, whose clear reasoning made it seem doubtful what the decision of the judges would be. After careful<br />\nconsideration of the form and argument of the<br />\ndebaters, Mr. William Marbury of the Baltimore Bar, on behalf of the judges, awarded<br />\nthe prize to the seniors, who received a silver<br />\ntrophy, which will shortly appear in the common room of the gymnasium.<br />\nEach of the winning speakers received a<br />\ngold medal, suitably engraved.

LANMAN'S LECTURES.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Charles Rockwell Lanman has just finished a most interesting course of lectures on<br />\n\"The Poetry of India.\" All those who have a<br />\npoetical nature could not fail to be pleased and<br />\ndelighted. The simple and beautiful hymns of<br />\nthe Vedas, so poetically translated by the lecturer and other scholars of Sanskrit literature,<br />\nwere a revelation to all. But they only served<br />\nto usher in that great Indian drama, \"The<br />\nSacontala ; or, The Fatal Ring.\" The marvelous beauty of this work opened up a new field<br />\nof vision to those who heard Dr. Lanman. In<br />\nit nature springs into life ; human sentiment<br />\ndwells in the flowers, the trees, the brook, the<br />\nwind, and all the mysteries of nature. Nature<br />\nand romanticism go hand in hand.<br />\nThe philosophy of the Hindoos is none the<br />\nless unique than their poetry, and is exceedingly interesting.<br />\nDr. Lanman took his A. B. at Yale in 1871,<br />\nand his Ph. D. in 1873. He was a favorite<br />\npupil of Professor Whitney, the Orientalist.<br />\nAfter graduating at Yale, he studied in Berlin<br />\nand at other German universities. In 1876 he<br />\ncame to Baltimore as a fellow of Sanskrit.<br />\nWhile here, Professor Bloomfield was his pupil<br />\nand took his doctor's degree under him. In<br />\n1877 he delivered a very successful course of<br />\npublic lectures in Baltimore on Vedic literature. He was soon made associate professor<br />\nof Sanskrit. In 188o he went to Harvard as<br />\nprofessor of Sanskrit, and still resides there.<br />\nHe was for many years the secretary of the<br />\nAmerican Oriental Society, and has read<br />\nmany valuable papers before that body.<br />\nDr. Lanman and Dr. Bloomfield are considered to be the most eminent Sanskrit scholars<br />\nin this country.<br />\nDr. Lanman has written two well-known<br />\nbooks : \"Noun Inflection in the Vedas\" and<br />\n\"A Sanskrit Reader.\"<br />\nHe has a very pleasing address, which<br />\nmakes his lectures even more delightful.<br />\nNo_one could attend them without becoming interested in that richness of local coloring<br />\nand imagery which is far more abundant in<br />\nIndian poetry than in our own.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nOVERHEARD AT SANS SOUCI.<br />\n<br />\nSaid Frederick, the Great, one day,<br />\nWhile sitting with his friend Voltaire<br />\nUpon the terraced, broad parterre\u2014<br />\n'Twas a rose-scented noon of May:<br />\n\"I emphasize\u2014each man, I say,<br />\nShould go to Heaven by his own way.\"<br />\nBehind them rose the old chateau.<br />\nBetween the murmurs of the mill,<br />\nFar down the flower - wreathed, rosecrowned hill,<br />\nThey heard the fountains' music flow.<br />\nBeyond, through the long avenue<br />\nThe oaks enframed the distant view.<br />\n\"I think you're wrong.\" The canny Gaul<br />\nSoon ventured, with a twinkling eye.<br />\n\"I should prefer, before I die,<br />\nTo try your way\u2014the best of all.<br />\nSo, just betwixt yourself and me,<br />\nI'll go to Heaven through Sans Souci.\"<br />\n\"For here old Adam's lost estate<br />\nWe for the nonce surely regain :<br />\n'Tis Eden, Paradise\u2014here vain<br />\nThe sword-armed angel at the gate.<br />\nNot travelers we.

The recent interclass debate and public-speaking contest<br />\nseems, however, to have been in every way a<br />\nthoroughly interesting and creditable affair.<br />\nThe audience was large and appreciative, and<br />\nthe men made a remarkable showing, considering the very limited training they have received. While there seems to be a difference<br />\nof opinion as to the appropriateness of speaking \"pieces\" as a college performance, it is<br />\ncertainly true that the said \"pieces\" were<br />\nwell selected and carefully rendered. But<br />\nwhen the selection is just a bit too classical,<br />\nthe well-known words will crowd the mind of<br />\nthe listener long before the speaker can utter<br />\nthem. It is to be hoped that next year the<br />\nspeeches will be original.<br />\nThe debate was lively and interesting<br />\nthroughout. Though no important contributions seem to have been made to the information generally current upon the immigration<br />\n<br />\nquestion, the speeches were well composed<br />\nand forcibly delivered. The men who closed<br />\nthe debate deserve special comment for the<br />\nF<br />\nunusual ability to\" think on their feet which<br />\nthey displayed.<br />\nThe effort to revive an interest in public<br />\nspeaking has met with flattering results, and it<br />\nis not too much to hope that the University<br />\nwill soon have many eloquent sons to guard<br />\nher interests. And it must not be forgotten<br />\nthat whatever success we have achieved has<br />\nbeen solely due to the sound judgment and<br />\nenthusiastic perseverance of Mr. Guy Carleton<br />\nLee, who has given so much of his time and<br />\nbest efforts to this work. It remains for the<br />\nstudents to keep up the interest in the new<br />\n\"Congress\" which has been established, until<br />\nit shall become a time-honored feature of<br />\nHopkins undergraduate life.<br />\n<br />\nThe three lectures of the Rev. Dr. Henry<br />\nVan Dyke, which were given recently in<br />\nMcCoy Hall, were among the most delightful<br />\nof the year. The combined popularity of the<br />\nspeaker and his subjects filled the hall to its<br />\nutmost capacity, making plain the fact that the<br />\nlove of poetry is not yet dead among us. His<br />\nfirst lecture was on Wordsworth, whose theme<br />\nhe said was Joy ; the second on Browning, whose theme was Courage and whose<br />\nwork was marked by a restless, intellectual<br />\ncuriosity, which the speaker made quite distinct from inquisitiveness; the third was on<br />\nTennyson, whose theme was Symmetry,<br />\nBeauty, Harmony.<br />\nTo Tennyson, Dr. Van Dyke gives the first<br />\nplace among Nineteenth Century poets. He<br />\nhas already published a volume on Tennyson,<br />\nand he is regarded as high authority in all<br />\ncritical work pertaining to him, so that this<br />\nlecture was listened to with deep attention.<br />\nThe Browning lecture was fine. There was<br />\nsomething akin to inspiration in the speaker,<br />\nand a great deal in the way of inspiration for<br />\nthe hearer, with some very discriminating<br />\nwords about Mr. Browning's poems.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nThe House Committee of the New Gymnasium has, we are glad to see, taken active<br />\nsteps to prevent students wearing heeled shoes<br />\nfrom entering the \"cage.\" A rope has been<br />\nplaced at the entrance to remind those who<br />\nare prone to forget the rules which have<br />\nWe must<br />\nbeen framed for this purpose.<br />\nsupport our committee loyally, or more<br />\nstringent measures will have to be employed.<br />\nBesides, we surely ought to appreciate the<br />\ntrouble and expense that has been experienced<br />\nto put our \"cage\" in the fine condition that<br />\nit is now in.

Let us hope that<br />\nthere are few of this type.<br />\nIt has been said that a new era is dawning<br />\nfor Hopkins athletics. This may be so, or it<br />\nmay not. The answer depends on us, the<br />\nundergraduates. Of the remainder of the University we cannot expect so much. Their<br />\nwork is more pressing and more confining,<br />\nand it is natural that they should be able to<br />\ngive little time to athletics. But with us the<br />\ncase is different. The trustees of the University have done their part ; the coaches are<br />\ndoing theirs ; the candidates for the teams<br />\nare working conscientiously ; and let us do<br />\nthe same. Let us be willing to make some<br />\nsacrifice, to give up some other pleasure, for<br />\nthe sake of supporting our athletics, and let us<br />\nrealize that the man who does so will be working for Johns Hopkins as truly as her most<br />\nardent supporter, and that, though his sacrifice may be unknown and unrecognized by the<br />\ncollege world, it will, nevertheless, be one of<br />\nwhich he may well be proud.<br />\nThese suggestions are made to Johns Hopkins students. The matter is not one for the<br />\nspecial consideration of the governing board<br />\nof the association. It is a matter to be considered, as well, by every man whose vote<br />\nhelped to create the governing board. It is a<br />\nmatter about which every undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate is entitled to an opinion. And it is<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\none about which every man ought to express<br />\nan opinion.

President Gilman made<br />\nthe introductory address and spoke of the revival of interest in public speaking and of its<br />\nimportance to the college man.<br />\nDean Griffin delivered the caution to the<br />\nfreshman aspirants for honor in public speaking, who were divided into two sections. In<br />\nthe first section D. M. Liddell spoke on \"Our<br /><br />\nNational Defense, the Citizen Soldier,\" while<br />\nA. V. A. Schermerhorn delivered a \"Speech<br />\nof Patrick Henry in 1775.\" The men and subjects in the second section were : Frederick<br />\nFoster, \"Our Relations With England in<br />\n1824\" ; W. P. Shriver, \"Centennial Address,\" and Herbert Kaufman, \"Universal<br />\nEmancipation.\" Professors Griffin, Greene<br />\nand Smith were judges of the speaking, and<br />\nawarded the prizes to Mr. Liddell and Mr.<br />\nKaufman.<br />\nThe main event of the evening was the debate between the classes of '98 and '99, over<br />\nwhich Mr. Lee presided. The question was :<br />\n\"Shall Immigration to This Country be Further Restricted ?\" Professor Adams warned<br />\nthe \" populace\" not to disturb the speakers,<br />\nwhom he especially urged to be \"persuasive.\"<br />\nHe cautioned the debaters to \"begin slow,<br />\nspeak low, rise higher ; take fire.\" The debate<br />\nwas then opened by Mr. J. N. Ulman, who<br />\neloquently presented arguments for the affirmative. He was followed by Mr. C. M. Guggenheimer, who spoke effectively for the negative. The convincing arguments which Mr.<br />\nC. M. Stearns coolly delivered were warmly<br />\nanswered by Mr. P. S. Morgan. Mr. Z. M.<br />\nBallard summed up the points made by the<br />\nseniors in a sarcastic address, which caused<br />\nconsiderable merriment. The debate was ably<br />\nclosed by Mr. J. C. French, whose clear reasoning made it seem doubtful what the decision of the judges would be. After careful<br />\nconsideration of the form and argument of the<br />\ndebaters, Mr. William Marbury of the Baltimore Bar, on behalf of the judges, awarded<br />\nthe prize to the seniors, who received a silver<br />\ntrophy, which will shortly appear in the common room of the gymnasium.<br />\nEach of the winning speakers received a<br />\ngold medal, suitably engraved.

LANMAN'S LECTURES.<br /><br />\nDr. Charles Rockwell Lanman has just finished a most interesting course of lectures on<br />\n\"The Poetry of India.\" All those who have a<br />\npoetical nature could not fail to be pleased and<br />\ndelighted. The simple and beautiful hymns of<br />\nthe Vedas, so poetically translated by the lecturer and other scholars of Sanskrit literature,<br />\nwere a revelation to all. But they only served<br />\nto usher in that great Indian drama, \"The<br />\nSacontala ; or, The Fatal Ring.\" The marvelous beauty of this work opened up a new field<br />\nof vision to those who heard Dr. Lanman. In<br />\nit nature springs into life ; human sentiment<br />\ndwells in the flowers, the trees, the brook, the<br />\nwind, and all the mysteries of nature. Nature<br />\nand romanticism go hand in hand.<br />\nThe philosophy of the Hindoos is none the<br />\nless unique than their poetry, and is exceedingly interesting.<br />\nDr. Lanman took his A. B. at Yale in 1871,<br />\nand his Ph. D. in 1873. He was a favorite<br />\npupil of Professor Whitney, the Orientalist.<br />\nAfter graduating at Yale, he studied in Berlin<br />\nand at other German universities. In 1876 he<br />\ncame to Baltimore as a fellow of Sanskrit.<br />\nWhile here, Professor Bloomfield was his pupil<br />\nand took his doctor's degree under him. In<br />\n1877 he delivered a very successful course of<br />\npublic lectures in Baltimore on Vedic literature. He was soon made associate professor<br />\nof Sanskrit. In 188o he went to Harvard as<br />\nprofessor of Sanskrit, and still resides there.<br />\nHe was for many years the secretary of the<br />\nAmerican Oriental Society, and has read<br />\nmany valuable papers before that body.<br />\nDr. Lanman and Dr. Bloomfield are considered to be the most eminent Sanskrit scholars<br />\nin this country.<br />\nDr. Lanman has written two well-known<br />\nbooks : \"Noun Inflection in the Vedas\" and<br />\n\"A Sanskrit Reader.\"<br />\nHe has a very pleasing address, which<br />\nmakes his lectures even more delightful.<br />\nNo_one could attend them without becoming interested in that richness of local coloring<br />\nand imagery which is far more abundant in<br />\nIndian poetry than in our own.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nOVERHEARD AT SANS SOUCI.<br /><br />\nSaid Frederick, the Great, one day,<br />\nWhile sitting with his friend Voltaire<br />\nUpon the terraced, broad parterre\u2014<br />\n'Twas a rose-scented noon of May:<br />\n\"I emphasize\u2014each man, I say,<br />\nShould go to Heaven by his own way.\"<br />\nBehind them rose the old chateau.<br />\nBetween the murmurs of the mill,<br />\nFar down the flower - wreathed, rosecrowned hill,<br />\nThey heard the fountains' music flow.<br />\nBeyond, through the long avenue<br />\nThe oaks enframed the distant view.<br />\n\"I think you're wrong.\" The canny Gaul<br />\nSoon ventured, with a twinkling eye.<br />\n\"I should prefer, before I die,<br />\nTo try your way\u2014the best of all.<br />\nSo, just betwixt yourself and me,<br />\nI'll go to Heaven through Sans Souci.\"<br />\n\"For here old Adam's lost estate<br />\nWe for the nonce surely regain :<br />\n'Tis Eden, Paradise\u2014here vain<br />\nThe sword-armed angel at the gate.<br />\nNot travelers we.

The recent interclass debate and public-speaking contest<br />\nseems, however, to have been in every way a<br />\nthoroughly interesting and creditable affair.<br />\nThe audience was large and appreciative, and<br />\nthe men made a remarkable showing, considering the very limited training they have received. While there seems to be a difference<br />\nof opinion as to the appropriateness of speaking \"pieces\" as a college performance, it is<br />\ncertainly true that the said \"pieces\" were<br />\nwell selected and carefully rendered. But<br />\nwhen the selection is just a bit too classical,<br />\nthe well-known words will crowd the mind of<br />\nthe listener long before the speaker can utter<br />\nthem. It is to be hoped that next year the<br />\nspeeches will be original.<br />\nThe debate was lively and interesting<br />\nthroughout. Though no important contributions seem to have been made to the information generally current upon the immigration<br /><br />\nquestion, the speeches were well composed<br />\nand forcibly delivered. The men who closed<br />\nthe debate deserve special comment for the<br />\nF<br />\nunusual ability to\" think on their feet which<br />\nthey displayed.<br />\nThe effort to revive an interest in public<br />\nspeaking has met with flattering results, and it<br />\nis not too much to hope that the University<br />\nwill soon have many eloquent sons to guard<br />\nher interests. And it must not be forgotten<br />\nthat whatever success we have achieved has<br />\nbeen solely due to the sound judgment and<br />\nenthusiastic perseverance of Mr. Guy Carleton<br />\nLee, who has given so much of his time and<br />\nbest efforts to this work. It remains for the<br />\nstudents to keep up the interest in the new<br />\n\"Congress\" which has been established, until<br />\nit shall become a time-honored feature of<br />\nHopkins undergraduate life.<br /><br />\nThe three lectures of the Rev. Dr. Henry<br />\nVan Dyke, which were given recently in<br />\nMcCoy Hall, were among the most delightful<br />\nof the year. The combined popularity of the<br />\nspeaker and his subjects filled the hall to its<br />\nutmost capacity, making plain the fact that the<br />\nlove of poetry is not yet dead among us. His<br />\nfirst lecture was on Wordsworth, whose theme<br />\nhe said was Joy ; the second on Browning, whose theme was Courage and whose<br />\nwork was marked by a restless, intellectual<br />\ncuriosity, which the speaker made quite distinct from inquisitiveness; the third was on<br />\nTennyson, whose theme was Symmetry,<br />\nBeauty, Harmony.<br />\nTo Tennyson, Dr. Van Dyke gives the first<br />\nplace among Nineteenth Century poets. He<br />\nhas already published a volume on Tennyson,<br />\nand he is regarded as high authority in all<br />\ncritical work pertaining to him, so that this<br />\nlecture was listened to with deep attention.<br />\nThe Browning lecture was fine. There was<br />\nsomething akin to inspiration in the speaker,<br />\nand a great deal in the way of inspiration for<br />\nthe hearer, with some very discriminating<br />\nwords about Mr. Browning's poems.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nThe House Committee of the New Gymnasium has, we are glad to see, taken active<br />\nsteps to prevent students wearing heeled shoes<br />\nfrom entering the \"cage.\" A rope has been<br />\nplaced at the entrance to remind those who<br />\nare prone to forget the rules which have<br />\nWe must<br />\nbeen framed for this purpose.<br />\nsupport our committee loyally, or more<br />\nstringent measures will have to be employed.<br />\nBesides, we surely ought to appreciate the<br />\ntrouble and expense that has been experienced<br />\nto put our \"cage\" in the fine condition that<br />\nit is now in.

Let us hope that<br />\nthere are few of this type.<br />\nIt has been said that a new era is dawning<br />\nfor Hopkins athletics. This may be so, or it<br />\nmay not. The answer depends on us, the<br />\nundergraduates. Of the remainder of the University we cannot expect so much. Their<br />\nwork is more pressing and more confining,<br />\nand it is natural that they should be able to<br />\ngive little time to athletics. But with us the<br />\ncase is different. The trustees of the University have done their part ; the coaches are<br />\ndoing theirs ; the candidates for the teams<br />\nare working conscientiously ; and let us do<br />\nthe same. Let us be willing to make some<br />\nsacrifice, to give up some other pleasure, for<br />\nthe sake of supporting our athletics, and let us<br />\nrealize that the man who does so will be working for Johns Hopkins as truly as her most<br />\nardent supporter, and that, though his sacrifice may be unknown and unrecognized by the<br />\ncollege world, it will, nevertheless, be one of<br />\nwhich he may well be proud.<br />\nThese suggestions are made to Johns Hopkins students. The matter is not one for the<br />\nspecial consideration of the governing board<br />\nof the association. It is a matter to be considered, as well, by every man whose vote<br />\nhelped to create the governing board. It is a<br />\nmatter about which every undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate is entitled to an opinion. And it is<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\none about which every man ought to express<br />\nan opinion.
