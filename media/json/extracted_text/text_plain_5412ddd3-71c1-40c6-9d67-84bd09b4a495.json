J. Bryan<br />\nHehir, a member of the United<br />\nStates Catholic Conference, in his<br />\nlecture titled \"Ethics and<br />\nStrategy: The Case of SDI\" in the<br />\nGarrett Room on March 9.<br />\nAccording to Hehir, the ethical<br />\ndebate regarding nuclear weapons<br />\nand war-fighting doctrine emerged in the 1980s. Moral considerations have become one of the key<br />\nissues in the nuclear debate. The<br />\nreverend elaborated on the four<br />\nmajor positions that compose the<br />\nethical debate.<br />\nThe first considers moral questions irrelevant to the policy<br />\narena. Those who espouse this<br />\nview believe that ethical considerations \"tell you nothing that<br />\nyou cannot learn in other ways.\"<br />\nThe second division believes<br />\nthat the moral argument, if it is<br />\ncorrect, can \"cut through the<br />\nstrategic argument. This<br />\nphilosophy is diametrically Onposed to that of the first.\"<br />\n\"Corruptive\" was the term<br />\nHehir used to label the third<br />\nperspective. According to this<br />\nanalysis, one can understand the<br />\n\"central moral principle is protecting civilians\", yet if this<br />\npremise is adhered to, \"you get<br />\nall the wrong strategic answers.\"<br />\nThe final manner in which<br />\nethical questions are considered is<br />\nthat they are complementary to<br />\nstrategic analysis. This ideology<br />\nbelieves that moral reasoning<br />\nregarding nuclear doctrines provides some insight that cannot be<br />\nattained from pure strategical<br />\nconsiderations. Hehir explained<br />\nthat \"the best way to engage in<br />\na discussion of SDI is through the<br />\ncomplementary notion.\"<br />\nThe morality of a defensive<br />\nsystem, he said, is based on<br />\ntechnical, strategic, economic,<br />\nand ethical analysis. Hehir went<br />\non to qualify this explanation.<br />\nAt the technical level, feasibility is the major question. Questions regarding the form such a<br />\nprogram would take and the ability of such a system to perform as<br />\npredicted must be answered.<br />\nThe reverend continued by saying that the strategic considerations include how the changes<br />\nwould effect the strategic balance<br />\nand whether such a system would<br />\nactually increase or decrease the<br />\nlikelihood of war. Alone, this<br />\nanalysis would not be considered<br />\nan argument of ethics, yet the outcome determines the ultimate<br />\nmoral question.<br />\nThe effect of such a program<br />\non the economy poses a great<br />\nethical question for policy makers<br />\nto deal with, according to Hehir.<br />\nWhere dollars are spent in the<br />\nface of a rising deficit adds additional dimension to the moral<br />\nargument, he said.<br />\nFinally, Hehir discussed the<br />\nnecessity of purely moral<br />\nargumentation. He offered no<br />\n\"final judgment\" on the Strategic<br />\n<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\n<br />\nThe Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, a member of the United States Catholic Conference, who delivered a lecture on the ethics and strategy of the Strategic<br />\nDefense Initiative.<br />\n<br />\nDefense Initiative yet he did say<br />\nthat he believed in \"the protection of civilians with absolute<br />\ncentrality.\"<br />\nHehir began by discussing the<br />\nhistorical perspectives on warfighting. He explained that<br />\nClauswitz, the Prussian General<br />\nwho believed that \"war is a rationally defensible activity\" and<br />\nAugustine, who believed that war<br />\nis not only rationally defensible<br />\npolitically but morally as well,<br />\n\"taught the West to think of war<br />\npolitics.\"<br />\nThere are two conflicting<br />\npremises from which the entire<br />\nnuclear debate stems, explained<br />\nHehir. One is that nuclear<br />\nweapons demand a \"radical<br />\ndiscontinuity\" from previous<br />\nstrategy decisions and ethical<br />\nconsiderations. The second is that<br />\nnuclear weapons require an extension of current strategy with no<br />\ntruly new questions.<br />\nThose who espouse the latter<br />\nbelief, he said, consider three<br />\n\"manifestations\" of the United<br />\nStates nuclear policy: limited<br />\nnuclear war, counterforce<br />\ntargeting, and defense. This<br />\ngroup \"attempts to think through<br />\nthe reality of the nuclear age.\"<br />\nHehir outlined the development<br />\nof each of these options. According to him, limited nuclear war<br />\nwas first considered by former<br />\nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger. The idea is fairly selfevident, said Hehir. A nuclear explosion could be detonated in a<br />\nparticular war zone and limited to<br />\nthat sphere, he said.<br />\nCounterforce, the paradigm<br />\nfirst advocated by former<br />\nSecretary of Defense Robert<br />\nMacNamara, now favored by the<br />\nundersecretary of defense, suggests a warfighting strategy which<br />\ndepends on second strike<br />\ncapabilities to retaliate against the<br />\nenemy after an initial nuclear<br />\nstrike occurs.<br />\nFinally, defense against nuclear<br />\n<br />\nweapons, a strategy favored by<br />\nthe President, includes antiballistic missiles and SDI. This<br />\nstrategy is \"an attempt to make<br />\nthese [nuclear] weapons fit into<br />\nclassical categories.\"<br />\nAfter<br />\nproviding<br />\nthis<br />\nbackground information, Hehir<br />\noutlined the progress which has<br />\nbeen made by nuclear strategists<br />\nsince the 1960s. The 1960s<br />\nbrought two main lines of thinking, he said. Paul Ramsey, said<br />\nHehir, believed that there exists<br />\nsuch a thing as \"justifiable use\".<br />\nJustifiable use leads to justifiable<br />\ndeterrent. \"Not that we have one<br />\nbut that it is possible to create.\"<br />\nexplained Hehir on Ramsey's<br />\nsentiments.<br />\nThe second philosophy was that<br />\nof Walter Stein. Hehir described<br />\nStein's argument as \"the counterpoint of Ramsey.\"<br />\nHehir explained that the discussions in the 1970s were led by<br />\nMichael Walters. His thoughts rejected the idea of use but not of<br />\ndeterrence.<br />\n\"The 1980s,\" declared Hehir,<br />\n\"brought theories of modifying<br />\ndeterrence.\" These ethicists do<br />\nnot reject or accept nuclear<br />\nstrategies. They are, according to<br />\nHehir, \"less confident than<br />\nRamsey yet not as opposed as<br />\nStein.\"<br />\nThe reverend himself supported the concept of a \"centimeter of ambiguity.\" This<br />\ntheory makes the eventual use of<br />\nsuch weapons \"not absolutely<br />\nimpossible.\"<br />\n\"Theories of deterrence are<br />\nunder attack from both the Left<br />\nand the Right,\" stated Hehir as<br />\nhe concluded the discussion of<br />\ndeterrence. The reverend explained that the increasing distrust of<br />\ndeterrence has led to the consideration of a defense posture to<br />\nreplace deterrence theories. Said<br />\nHehir, \"Reagan sees SDI as a<br />\nway out.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fLecture Series: Morality of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear War<br />\n<br />\nHarvard Prof Nye Analyzes<br />\nTrends in Nuclear Debate<br />\nby Jonathan Engler<br />\nSpeaking yesterday at the final<br />\ninstallment of the series titled,<br />\n\"The Morality of Nuclear<br />\nWeapons and Nuclear War, \"<br />\nwas Harvard University professor<br />\nof political science Joseph Nye.<br />\nThe director of Harvard's<br />\nCenter for International Affairs,<br />\nNye is a recognized national<br />\nfigure in the study of nuclear<br />\nethics.<br />\nNye began his lecture with an<br />\nanecdote about a man walking<br />\nalong a cliff, who then falls over<br />\nthe side. Grabbing a branch as he<br />\nis about to fall into the rocky surf,<br />\nthe man looked up the cliff and<br />\nasked if there was anyone there.<br />\nA voice yelled down to have<br />\nfaith, and let go. The man paused<br />\na moment, and asked if there was<br />\nanyone else there.<br />\nOn the realization that the total<br />\nexplosive power used in World<br />\nWar II is contained in a single<br />\nnuclear warhead today, Nye<br />\nstated that the public has been<br />\nconcerned with nuclear morality<br />\nfor quite some time.<br />\nFrom 1958 to 1962, he said,<br />\npublic awareness was at a very<br />\nhigh level because of the tensions<br />\nof the Cold War, which he said<br />\nculminated in the Cuban Missile<br />\nCrisis.<br />\nIn the following years, after the<br />\n1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban<br />\nTreaty, public concern waned,<br />\nonly to return with a vengeance<br />\nin the early 1980s. The failure of<br />\nthe Senate to ratify the Strategic<br />\nArms Limitation Talks Treaty<br />\nand the Reagan Administration<br />\nrhetoric in support of a strong<br />\ndefense accentuated his concern.<br />\nThe result of the public concern<br />\nwas a striking softening in the<br />\nReagan line from one of \"no<br />\ncompromise\" in 1980 to a more<br />\nmoderate stance today. The<br />\ndecline of public alarm since<br />\n1984 has been marked by the<br />\nReagan proposal to eliminate the<br />\nthreat of nuclear war through the<br />\nStrategic Defense Initiative, and<br />\nactive pursuit of a productive<br />\narms treaty in the years following his 1984 re-election.<br />\nNye noted a rising tide of<br />\npublic concern over the last<br />\ndecade, which he said transcends<br />\nthe shifting opinions of the 1960s.<br />\nOne reason he gave is that there<br />\nis considerable awareness now<br />\nthat nuclear weapons are not just<br />\nanother kind of artillery but a real<br />\nthreat to the existence of the<br />\nworld.<br />\nIn the 1960s, said Nye, there<br />\nwere two predominant schools of<br />\nthought, the strategic and the<br />\ntheological. Theologians argued<br />\nthat since nuclear weapons ex-<br />\n<br />\nCorrection<br />\nBecause ofa production error<br />\nin last week's News-Letter,<br />\nAndrew Chun 's Young Trustee<br />\nstatement was not printed and<br />\nWinston Vaughan 's statement<br />\nwas printed under Chun 's<br />\nname. The News-Letter<br />\napologizes for the error and<br />\nany inconvenience it caused.<br />\n<br />\nistence is based on the assumption<br />\nthat their use is immoral, whereas<br />\nthe strategists said that one should<br />\njudge the morality of the consequence of an action, rather than<br />\non intentions.<br />\nThe 1980s have brought a new<br />\nschool of thought, which Nye<br />\ncalled the \"anti-nuclear consequentialists.\" Their stand rests on<br />\nthe idea that we have no right to<br />\nbehave in ways that might<br />\npreclude the ability of future<br />\ngenerations to live. Given two<br />\nassumptions, the infallibility of<br />\nhumans and the Murphy's Law<br />\nthat anything that can happen<br />\nwill, the Consequentialists<br />\nbelieve that the possibility of conflict precludes any claim of<br />\nmorality on the part of nuclear<br />\ndeterrence.<br />\nThe leaders of the world appear<br />\nto be coming to the same conclusion, said Nye, as seen by the<br />\nnear agreement of Soviet Premier<br />\nMikhail Gorbachev and Reagan<br />\nin 1986 on the idea of eliminating<br />\nall nuclear weapons in ten years.<br />\nNye asked rhetorically if this<br />\nreasoning is compelling. He<br />\nfound the answer to be no.<br />\nFirst, Nye said the argument<br />\nrests on the view that we cannot<br />\nmake nuclear policy decisions<br />\nwhich will negatively affect<br />\nfuture generations. It is hard, he<br />\ncontinued, to decide what future<br />\ngenerations will want, but one<br />\ncan assume things like survival<br />\nwill be high on their list of<br />\npriorities.<br />\nHe said, though, that the condition of survival is not so simple. Differentiating between absolute and necessary reasons for<br />\nsurvival, Nye denied that man<br />\nsearches for absolute survival ,<br />\n<br />\npointing out that every time one<br />\ngets in a car one os trading off a<br />\nbit of absolute survival for<br />\nmobility.<br />\nNye continued that the highly<br />\ncontrolled situation between the<br />\nsuperpowers of their weapons<br />\nand open communication behind<br />\nthe scenes would appear to make<br />\nthe risk of a nation like Pakistan<br />\nusing the bomb much more likely than either the Soviet Union or<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nIn response to the question of<br />\nwhat to do about nuclear arms,<br />\nNye introduced an alternative to<br />\nthe traditional hawk and dove<br />\nperspectives called the \"owl,\"<br />\na school of thought that thinks the<br />\ntechnical entanglements and<br />\nmisunderstandings of World War<br />\nI are the most likely future cause<br />\nof a nuclear conflict today.<br />\nThe answer to immediate<br />\nnuclear policy would be to focus<br />\non short-term risks and their<br />\nreduction, he said.

When the time comes for Council's<br />\nendorsement of SAC recipients, the annual<br />\nselection process usually breaks down to a<br />\nverbal free-for-all in which graduating<br />\nseniors get one last chance to stab each<br />\nother in the back. Last year was no exception. Council rejected the first list of thirtytwo recipients proposed by the SAC. The<br />\nSAC was then forced to trim the list down<br />\nto fourteen seniors. It was not a pretty sight.<br />\nThree years ago, in a similarly ugly<br />\nscene, Council members actually began to<br />\nhurl obscenitites at one another during the<br />\ndebate over the Seals.<br />\nThis year, the Student Activities Award<br />\nReview Committee was established to make<br />\nsure all the hoopla won't happen again. The<br />\ncommittee, which was formed last<br />\nsemester, investigated solutions to the Seal<br />\nproblem ranging from modifications to the<br />\nselection procedure rules, to creating an<br />\nalternative award, to bagging the idea of<br />\nstudent activity awards altogether. Unfortunately, the committee decided to recom-<br />\n<br />\nmend modifications.<br />\nWe can't argue with the details of the<br />\nchanges. Moving the process to an earlier<br />\ndate and insisting upon flexibility in the<br />\nselection system seems wise\u2014wise, that is,<br />\nif you agree with the premise of the committee which is: \"recognition [should] be<br />\ngiven to those students who have made<br />\noutstanding contributions to student<br />\nactivities.''<br />\nWe do not agree with that premise.<br />\nStudents shouldn't become involved in<br />\nactivities in order to be \"recognized\" at<br />\nthe end. Furthermore, there is no point in<br />\nruining one's last days at Hopkins because<br />\nof a ridiculously trivial award.<br />\nRecent history at Homewood has shown<br />\nyear after year that there is no way to<br />\n\"honor\" students for their participation in<br />\nstudent activities without creating turmoil.<br />\nWhile the modifications to the selection<br />\nprocess proposed by the committee may<br />\nmake the process a little easier logistically, feelings will undoubtedly be hurt this<br />\nyear as always.<br />\nNow, the SAC and Council seem headed for another showdown over the Seals,<br />\nif not this year, then next year. We can't<br />\nhelp wondering how many more ugly fights<br />\nwill be necessary before the Seals are<br />\nscrapped.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nAn Absolute Right<br />\nTo the Editor<br />\nYou have no reason for shame<br />\nwith regard to the recent Terwilliger affair. You took positive<br />\naction to confirm Mr. Terwilliger's views and printed them<br />\nin an open forum. You acted in<br />\na responsible manner and upheld<br />\nhis freedom of expression.<br />\nBy misrepresenting himself and<br />\nabusing the forum, Mr. Terwilliger demonstrated one of<br />\nDemocracy's highest values: his<br />\nabsolute right to make a fool of<br />\nhimself.<br />\nDon Braswell<br />\n<br />\nBurden of a Crack-pot<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nJoseph D. Terwilliger has<br />\nplayed on my emotions in order<br />\nto prove his point. He felt it<br />\nnecessary to abuse the freedom of<br />\nexpression on this campus by<br />\ntargeting the local Jewish community with a letter denying the<br />\nHolocaust\u2014solely to see if it<br />\nwould be printed, and to elicit a<br />\nresponse.<br />\nWith freedom of expression,<br />\nwe must accept the burden of an<br />\noccasional crackpot that abuses<br />\nthe system. Joseph D. Terwilliger, how many morals and<br />\nemotions is it necessary to<br />\n<br />\ndisregard in order to show that<br />\nfree speech does exist?<br />\nHeinan Landa<br />\nThe writer is the Co-President of<br />\nthe Jewish Students Association<br />\n<br />\nCommending the N-L<br />\n<br />\nI speak on behalf of Pi Sigma<br />\nAlpha when I say I was truly<br />\nshocked and disappointed to<br />\ndiscover that the Academic Council had rejected the recommendation of the Political Science<br />\nDepartment and denied Dr.<br />\nDavid's promotion.<br />\nAny C.I.P. student will attest to<br />\nProfessor David's outstanding<br />\nability to teach. His dedication to<br />\nthe University is illustrated by his<br />\ndevotion to establishing an International Studies Program which<br />\nhas become the second largest<br />\nmajor at Hopkins.<br />\nIt seems the only aspect which<br />\nthe Academic Council can question, is whether Dr. David's<br />\nresearch meets the standards of<br />\nquality and volume set forth by<br />\nthe University. However, this<br />\nquestion was resolutely affirmed<br />\nDepartment<br />\nthe<br />\nwhen<br />\nUNANIMOUSLY supported<br />\nDavid's promotion. Who can better apply these standards than the<br />\nmen and women who have<br />\nthemselves met the University's<br />\ncriteria? Clearly, Dr. David has<br />\nthe support of the faculty and student body. This can only lead one<br />\nto believe that his denied promotion was due to yet another tangle<br />\nin the University's medusan<br />\nbureaucracy.<br />\nI join the members of Pi Sigma<br />\nAlpha in imploring the Academic<br />\nCouncil to reconsider its decision<br />\nregarding Dr. David's promotion. Futhermore, I urge each individual member to recall Daniel<br />\nCoit Gilman's dream for a<br />\nUniversity where knowledge is a<br />\ndynamic force. If Professor<br />\nDavid's work has stirred any controversy in the academic community, I applaud it as an indication of creative inquiry rather<br />\nthan static recitation.<br />\n<br />\nMembers of the Academic<br />\nCouncil,<br />\nIn 1874 Daniel Coit Gilman<br />\nproposed before a Board of<br />\nTrustees a University which<br />\nwould regard knowledge as \"a<br />\ndynamic living force in human affairs rather than a revered<br />\nhistorical document.\" In this<br />\ndesire the Trustees heartily concurred and formally elected Dr.<br />\nGilman as the first president of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nEvery once in a great while, a<br />\nstudent will find an instructor<br />\nwho embodies this vision. It is indeed a rare privilege when one<br />\nencounters the professor who can<br />\nturn a lecture into a thoughtprovoking inquiry as opposed to<br />\na tedious transfer of information.<br />\nThe members of the Gamma Rho<br />\nchapter of Pi Sigma Alpha (The<br />\nNational Political Science Honor<br />\nSociety) feel that Dr. Stephen R.<br />\nDavid is such a scholar.<br />\nCombining a clear grasp of the<br />\ninternational milieu with a<br />\nrefreshing sense of humor, David<br />\nis without a doubt one of the most<br />\nadmired instructors at the University. His lectures are consistently organized and well-integrated<br />\nwith current events. Outside the<br />\nclassroom, his courses are<br />\nchallenging and require rigorous<br />\nstudy but the demands he puts on<br />\nhis students are no more than he<br />\nexpects from himself. In this way<br />\nhe has earned the respect of his<br />\nhas no place in the press. Ter- pupils.<br />\nwilliger did indeed \"make a<br />\nmockery of this forum and the<br />\nprinciple of freedom of expression.\" I applaud the News-Letter<br />\nTimothy McNamara<br />\nfor handling this event<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nprofessionally.<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\n<br />\nMeredith Jacobson<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nSneezing on Muller<br />\nI would like to commend the<br />\nNews-Letter for the way in which<br />\nit dealt with the controversy<br />\nfollowing Joseph Terwilliger's<br />\npreposterous letter. First of all,<br />\nthe News-Letter had not only the<br />\nright but the responsibility to print<br />\nTerwilliger's first letter. If the<br />\nmedia only relayed the views and<br />\ninformation which coincided with<br />\nthe opinions of the majority, imagine what a mild, biased report<br />\nwould result. Contrary to some of<br />\nthe angry responses which you<br />\nreceived, freedom of expression<br />\ndoes include the expression of unpopular ideas. Note that even<br />\nthose letters which criticized the<br />\nNews-Letter were printed, including those by Mr. Jonah<br />\nCohen, who seemed to imply that<br />\nthe News-Letter could be guilty of<br />\nlibel by association.<br />\nSecond, the News-Letter dealt<br />\nadmirably with Terwilliger's second letter, in which he justified<br />\nthe first with the pretense of proving \"the hypocritical nature of<br />\nour belief in freedom.\" This kind<br />\nof blatant manipulation is irresponsible and dangerous, and<br />\n<br />\nThefollowing is the text ofa letter written to the Academic Counoil by Chrysso B. Sarkos, the<br />\npresident of the Gamma Rho<br />\nChapter of the Pi Sigma Alpha<br />\nNational Political Honor Society.<br />\nIt is printed here with the consent<br />\nof the writer.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHaving graduated some time<br />\nago, I rarely read the NewsLetter. When I come across a<br />\ncopy, I skim it quickly as a<br />\nnostalgic spectator. However, I<br />\ncannot ignore the denial of promotion to Dr. David. Through<br />\nthe years, Hopkins has occasionally done things which make<br />\nme ashamed to admit my association with the school. Denying<br />\ntenure to Steven David is certainly one of them.<br />\nHe is one of the most popular<br />\nprofessors because he is one of<br />\nthe best. His classes are enjoyable<br />\nnot only because he is cute, not<br />\nonly because he is a lively and enthusiastic lecturer, but also<br />\nbecause he is extremely intelligent and very thorough. He<br />\npresents the concepts of political<br />\nscience from every angle. He<br />\nreminds undergraduates that \"interesting lecture\" is not a contradiction in terms.<br />\nContinued on Page 12<br />\n<br />\nAaron Davis, Flory Ware<br />\nJonathan Engler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jon Stempel<br />\nLoren Fox, Laurah Limbrick<br />\nJay Lechtman<br />\nEly Brown, Joseph Gergyes<br />\nVandana Kumra<br />\nChristopher Szeles, Adam Warner<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nJess Bunshaft, Ganesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nEditor<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nLayout Editors<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nFeatures Editor<br />\nScience Editors<br />\nBooks Editor<br />\nSports Editors<br />\nCopy Editors<br />\nPhoto Editors<br />\n<br />\nStaff Writers: Uri Ahn, L.

Oh good\u2014a hotdog.<br />\nCharles Village and the other<br />\nneighborhoods around Hopkins<br />\ndeserve a late-night fast-food<br />\nplace, restaurant or coffee shop.<br />\nThe college towns of big state<br />\nuniversities all have at least one.<br />\nEven the sleepy neighborhoods of<br />\nsmall colleges have something.<br />\nBut consider Hopkins. Before<br />\nLetterman even begins the evening, most places have closed.<br />\nWhy? Hopkins has a large<br />\nenough community to support at<br />\nleast one late-night joint, especially since this demented group<br />\nsimply loves staying up late to<br />\nstudy and so many of us live offcampus in the Charles Village<br />\nneighborhood, unable to even<br />\nboil an egg. There are four drycleaners along St. Paul. The<br />\nGiant at the Rotunda is crowded<br />\nat two in the morning. Is a simple little restaurant too much to<br />\nask? Pizza delivery is already a<br />\ncrowded field, and the market can<br />\ntake only so much pepperoni. Someone will make immense profits<br />\nby opening up anything remotely similar to a late-night<br />\nrestaurant.<br />\nThree suggestions:<br />\n(1) It could be a McDonald's or<br />\nany other fast-food operation.<br />\nThe McShuttle operation is a noble effort, but it just isn't the real<br />\nthing, which would be a fast-food<br />\nplace within four blocks of the<br />\nmain entrance to Hopkins. As it<br />\nis now, the closest place is on<br />\nGreenmount Avenue, and it's not<br />\nthe safest place to be wandering<br />\naround. The only problem is integrating an ugly fast-food place<br />\nwith the neighborhood, a<br />\nlegitimate worry although it is<br />\nusually used by established places<br />\nto ward off competition. Some<br />\nwould argue the neighborhood<br />\nisn't good-looking to begin with,<br />\nso no damage could be done. But<br />\nfast-food places have wised up<br />\nrecently anyway, thinking about<br />\npleasant and safe design instead<br />\nof hurrying customers through,<br />\nand the issue is purely academic<br />\nat this point.<br />\n(2)It could be a restaurant with<br />\n<br />\nDear Cruel,<br />\nNasty job, this heartbreaking,<br />\neh?

At<br />\nleast you're showing some<br />\nforethought before you commit<br />\nrelationship murder.<br />\nWhat we're dealing with here,<br />\nis a fragile, elusive, vulnerable<br />\nlittle creature frequently called<br />\n\"the male ego.\" A frightened little thing, this housepet, \"the male<br />\nego,\" thrives under loving care,<br />\ntender petting, and constant<br />\nfeedings. Unlike the female ego,'<br />\nwhich is quite durable from frequent abuse and blows equivalent<br />\nto that of a battering ram, the<br />\nmale ego is much more sensitive.<br />\nYou must be careful in handling<br />\nthis creature, for one good, verbal whack will send it scurrying<br />\nfor cover underneath the<br />\n<br />\nby Londa Holsinger<br />\n<br />\nchairs that aren't attached to the<br />\ntables, with silverware, a menu,<br />\nservers and absolutely no ferns.<br />\nThere are restaurants in the area,<br />\nArmand's and Casey's, but<br />\nneither stays open for insomniacs.<br />\nThere are also bars like Pis and<br />\nCharles Village Pub. While they<br />\nserve food, some of it well worth<br />\nit, they are more bars than<br />\nrestaurants: too loud, catering to<br />\na definite crowd, and hampered<br />\nby laws regarding alcohol. A<br />\nrestaurant, where, for example,<br />\nan omelette could be had, would<br />\nneed to have low prices, fast service and a large menu. That<br />\nalmost sounds like asking too<br />\nmuch, so throwing in \"open all<br />\nnight\" may place it beyond all<br />\nhope, but there are places which<br />\nmanage to do it. Whether it's a<br />\ngreasy spoon type of place or a<br />\nDenny's, it would have a following. Perhaps Gampy's will see the<br />\nwisdom of bringing uptown a<br />\ncheaper, open-all-night, even better version of their successful<br />\nyuppie hangout.<br />\n(3) A cafe, cheap and intimate.<br />\nFor what it is, the Gilman Coffee Shop is wonderful.

His earlier public<br />\nmisrepresentations, we learn<br />\n<br />\nfrom his second letter (N-L<br />\n3-6-87), were but a sleight of<br />\nhand with which he unveiled our<br />\nhypocrisies vis-a-vis the Freedom<br />\nof Expression uproar. His first<br />\nletter, he says, was a fable, but<br />\nit did not lack a moral.<br />\nThe apparent purpose of the<br />\nruse was to determine the degree<br />\nto which the Hopkins community approximates one of the three<br />\ntypes of totalitarian society Terwilliger is able to think of, Nazi,<br />\nCommunist, or \"etc.\" The proposition he employs is a simple<br />\none: if the N-L refuses to print my<br />\n(fraudulent) letter, then campus<br />\nsociety is either Nazi. Communist, or etc.<br />\nI am having the greatest difficulty imagining the Nazi society that would not welcome Terwilliger's (first) letter, and since<br />\na child could discern that our<br />\ncampus is not a Communist cell,<br />\nI am grateful to the N-L for having dispelled, by the simple act of<br />\nprinting the letter, any suggestion<br />\nthat we are living in a totalitarian<br />\nsociety named by a Latin<br />\nabbreviation.<br />\nThere are, however, less<br />\npositive aspects of Terwilliger's<br />\nchicanery. His actions were<br />\npredicated on a gutwash of halfbaked premises, but he was willing, nonetheless, to invest a<br />\nsubstantial amount of time and<br />\nenergy into their execution, if not<br />\ninto considering their implications and probable effects.

There are over 92,000<br />\nJews in Baltimore who, along<br />\nwith help from the University, aid<br />\nthe JSA in their activities. In recent years, Judaism as a whole<br />\nhas suffered something of an<br />\nidentity crisis. The fundamental<br />\nquestion, \"What does it mean to<br />\nbe Jewish?\" may have something<br />\nof an answer in the JSA. With<br />\neducational programs, social<br />\nevents and cultural activities relevant to Jewish life, the JSA hopes<br />\nto make JHU students more conscious of their cultural and<br />\nreligious heritage.<br />\nThe JSA is by no means a purely religious organization,<br />\nhowever. Of course, there are<br />\nregular services as well as those<br />\non the High Holy days, but the<br />\nJSA extends far beyond that<br />\naspect of Jewish life. Few, if any<br />\nclubs, are as active as the JSA,<br />\nwhich organizes two to three<br />\nfunctions per week.

They<br />\nare a group constantly asking of<br />\neach other, Are you all right?\"<br />\nThey have good reason to<br />\nworry.<br />\nHenry is not only a playwright,<br />\nbut an intellectual heavyweight<br />\nalternately proud and embarrassed of liking American pop music<br />\nfrom the sixties. His lines are<br />\nalmost as good as those in his<br />\nplay, which is high camp more<br />\nthan anything. The sensitive<br />\nromantic type, he is abused by<br />\nboth Charlotte and Annie. His<br />\nplay tells of the past and predicts<br />\nthe future, his salvation is in his<br />\nmusic, and he worries too much,<br />\nin the end either flipping his emotions with unexpected ease or<br />\nsimply being manipulated with<br />\n<br />\nsurprising ignorance of things.<br />\nFor his part, Long's debut on the<br />\nHopkins stage is appropriate,<br />\nbelievable and energetic. It is only when he lowers his voice to<br />\nmake a speech that he lowers his<br />\nmessage. A fine passage about<br />\nwriting, a tough subject for<br />\ndrama, is weakened by this<br />\nartifice.<br />\nOf Annie he says that he has<br />\nnever met anyone so silly. She<br />\nbegins as a crazy woman intent on<br />\nhaving the affair, saying it is after<br />\nall only two marriages and a kid<br />\nat stake. But she changes, becoming petulant, chaotic. She never<br />\nliked Henry for his mind and,<br />\nafter they do have an affair and<br />\ncontinue having it, she comes to<br />\nthe point of being angry that<br />\nHenry finishes her sentences.<br />\nGerry does a better job with Annie on the make.<br />\nShe is radiant. Loud, often just<br />\nabout to laugh (perhaps too<br />\noften), passionate: this is a polished performance (returned to with<br />\na later affair). Distraught, arguing, outraged: this is ranting, a<br />\nperformance better left unpolished. This is not to be harsh about<br />\nthe later Annie, if only the<br />\nvolume were turned down a bit.<br />\nIt may simply be the script. Artist and actors are a difficult subject. If there is a weakness in the<br />\notherwise admirable plot, it is a<br />\ncertain roughness and suddenness, jerking the characters all<br />\nover in the later scenes. The<br />\nscript does not sustain its focus.<br />\nWhen Henry and Annie, Max and<br />\nCharlotte are gathered together in<br />\n<br />\nJeremy Golub and Elena Schiro in The Real Thing.<br />\n<br />\nthe second scene, the play is tightly put together. It wanders later,<br />\nalways good. but veering off now<br />\nand then.<br />\nBoth the character of Max and<br />\nthe actor Jeremy Golub deserve<br />\nappearances in more of the<br />\nscenes, Max having some of the<br />\nplay's best lines in the opening<br />\nscene, offering them by flailing<br />\nlike a madman and Golub delivering two fine performances.

There's no time for a premed to take music courses, for<br />\nexample, so this is the only contact with music that some students<br />\nhave. It lets you do something different.\" Some of the members<br />\nare very serious about the music,<br />\nand others simply enjoy singing,<br />\nbut they are drawn together<br />\nbecause they find making music<br />\nwith other people and performing<br />\nit to be extremely gratifying.<br />\nWith singing comes a real sense<br />\n<br />\nof creating something\u2014the music<br />\ncomes out of you, so you don't<br />\nneed to bring along any other instrument. Seeing a piece of music<br />\ngrow from its first tentative<br />\nrehearsal to perfection at a concert is an accomplishment which<br />\nis hard to duplicate. Then too, it's<br />\nfun. Singing is an outlet that takes<br />\nthe pressure off and at the same<br />\ntime lets you participate in<br />\nsometing both social and<br />\nworthwhile.

In addition, the group always sings at<br />\ncommemoration and frequently<br />\nplans tours outside of Baltimore.<br />\nThe Fall and Spring concerts consist of one long musical piece and<br />\n<br />\nseveral smaller pieces.

Those which survive are further subject to the<br />\nprivations of self-justification.<br />\nWhat emerges may indeed be<br />\nwhat the rememberer believes to<br />\nbe true, and at the same time<br />\nfall far afield of THE TRUTH,an<br />\nideal which no one meets or much<br />\nexpects to. So, it falls to the<br />\nhistorian to hear what he may,<br />\nand form that which determines<br />\nwhat he will believe.<br />\nThis problem forms the crux of<br />\nMario Vargas Llosa's The Real<br />\nLife of Alejandro Mayta. Llosa<br />\naddresses the issue very directly.<br />\nnarrator/quasi-main<br />\nThe<br />\ncharacter expalins that he is<br />\nwriting a fictionalized account of<br />\nthe life of a friend, who participated in an attempted leftist<br />\nrevolution more than twenty<br />\nyears previously. He then leads the<br />\nreader through a string of interviews which provide widely<br />\ndisparate accounts of events, but<br />\nalways with enough corroborating detail to prevent their<br />\n_being ruled out as obviously<br />\n<br />\nfalse. Each speaker presents a<br />\nversion of the truth which best<br />\nserves his or her interests. All<br />\nseem ready to lay most, if not all<br />\nthe blame for mistakes and<br />\nfailures at the feet of Mayta, the<br />\nerstwhile protagonist of the story.<br />\nParallel to the interviews, there<br />\nruns a narration of the same, or<br />\nroughly contemporaneous, events<br />\nas those covered by the interviews which is presented out of<br />\nquotes. The implication clearly is<br />\nthat this account is either THE<br />\nTRUTH, or else the interpretation and synthesis of facts in the<br />\nmind of the narrator. Which is actually the case is never made<br />\nclear. This is the beginning of the<br />\nconfusion which permeates The<br />\nReal Life and which at times<br />\nmakes the book extremely difficult to follow.<br />\nIt becomes painfully obvious<br />\nthat trouble is on the way when<br />\none realizes that all speakers and<br />\nall voices are presented in the<br />\nsame format, i.e. there are no<br />\nchanges in type-face or chapter<br />\nsubdivisions to act as guideposts.<br />\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that voices<br />\nspeak interlinearly. One line from<br />\nan interview is followed by one<br />\nline of dialogue from THE<br />\nTRUTH is followed by one line<br />\nof Mayta's thoughts in the first<br />\nperson which appear now and<br />\nagain just to make sure that the<br />\nreader understands that not all<br />\nfirst person references need be<br />\nfrom the subjective 'truth.'<br />\n<br />\nFrameworks for the action and of<br />\nthe speakers and their relationships to reality form in the<br />\nreader's mind only to be shattered<br />\ntwo pages later.<br />\nWhile presenting this convoluted picture of past events,<br />\nfilled with contradictions and<br />\njustifications, the narrator also<br />\nkeeps up a running commentary<br />\non \"current\" events taking place<br />\nin a fictionalized Peru. It is a<br />\ncountry in dire economic and<br />\nHuge<br />\nstraits.<br />\npolitical<br />\nneighborhoods of shacks fester in<br />\nLima while the right-wing<br />\nmilitary government attempts to<br />\nend internal violence and prevent<br />\nexternal interference. Depictions<br />\nof modern guerilla violence are<br />\nmixed in with the rest of the text<br />\nand sometimes seem indistinguishable from past events.<br />\nThis co-mingling is entirely intentional as the narrator attempts to<br />\ndraw a parallel between the<br />\nearlier, unsuccessful revolution<br />\nand the current one, which shows<br />\nsigns of being much more<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nThrough all the twists and turns<br />\nof the plot, Mayta remains<br />\nsomething of an enigma. It is<br />\n\u2022 readily obvious that he is a Trotskyist revolutionary in a tiny<br />\nsplinter party. The earnest\u2014and<br />\nundoubtedly true to life\u2014<br />\ndiscussions about the ideological<br />\nimplications of the name of the<br />\nparty newspaper (\"Workers<br />\nVoice-T [for Trotskyist, to<br />\ndistinguish it from the less revolu-<br />\n<br />\ntionary \"Workers Voice\" with<br />\nno TI) and about the role of a true<br />\nvanguard party provide amusing<br />\nspots in an otherwise bleak picture. Mayta's place in the party<br />\nis unassailable until he proves<br />\nhimself traitorous by meeting<br />\nwith a mainline Stalinist Communist. His real sin, however, is<br />\nhis desire to act to bring about the<br />\nrevolution, while his comrades<br />\nseem resigned or even relieved<br />\nthat the party should remain conspiratorial and theoretical. When<br />\npresented with a chance to act,<br />\nMayta seizes it and sees it through<br />\nto the end. His failure seals his<br />\nplace in the memory of his former<br />\nparty comrades, who are shown<br />\nthrough their interviews with the<br />\nnarrator to have sold out to the<br />\nsystem in exchange for a comfortable place in it.<br />\nTaken in a sentence- and<br />\nsometimes paragraph-length<br />\ndoses. Llosa can produce very<br />\nvivid images of setting.

The Homewood community has recently demonstrated its commitment to that principle by its response to events centering on the construction of shanties on campus during the past year.<br />\nFollowing months of debate, a faculty committee has issued a preliminary<br />\nreport on freedom of expression which illustrates the difficulty of characterizing the limits on that freedom. Like any other freedom, that of expression is<br />\ndelicate; it flourishes in an environment of mutual tolerance, respect and<br />\nopen debate, but withers in a climate which fosters secretive attacks on<br />\nlegitimate forms of expression.<br />\nWe believe that the Homewood community will find actions such as the<br />\ndefacing of posters a caricature of academic freedom, inimicable to the<br />\nacademic enterprise. If those responsible have legitimate views they wish to<br />\nexpress, we urge them to do so openly, in the spirit of free debate, rather<br />\nthan adopting tactics which inhibit open discourse.<br />\nGeorge W.

It's<br />\ncozy, home-like interior makes it<br />\na comfortable setting for anyone<br />\nto drop in. Situated behind<br />\nMcCauley Hall, the White House<br />\nand<br />\nprovides counseling<br />\npsychiatric services for Hopkins<br />\nstudents, faculty, and staff. Since ,<br />\n1973, Dr. Ghislaine Godenne has<br />\ndirected the center, and she<br />\nassumed control of all clinical<br />\nservices at Hopkins in 1978.<br />\nA M.D. graduate from Louvain, Belgium, where she had<br />\nbeen president of the student<br />\nbody, Dr. Godenne arrived from<br />\nEurope on a Fulbright Scholarship. Since then she has obtained<br />\nextensive training in pediatrics,<br />\nresearch<br />\nand<br />\npediatric<br />\nchild/adolescent/adult psychiatry.<br />\nIn 1962, she became the first<br />\nfemale chief resident while in the<br />\ndepartment of psychiatry at Johns<br />\nHospital.<br />\nHer<br />\nHopkins<br />\ndistinguished career also includes<br />\na recent decoration as Officer of<br />\nthe Order of Leopold for her<br />\nadolescent psychiatry research,<br />\nand presidency of the American<br />\nSociety of Adolescent Psychiatry.<br />\nThe White House provides different treatments for various<br />\npsychological problems. Usually,<br />\nstudents seeking help are<br />\nevaluated and then referred for<br />\npsychotherapy. Depending on the<br />\nevaluation, this can take the form<br />\nof individual therapy with a<br />\ncounselor, or medication from a<br />\npracticing psychiatrist. Group<br />\n<br />\ntherapy, with 5 or 6 participants,<br />\ncan be helpful for students sharing the same problem; e.g.,<br />\n\"terrible anxiety over a test\" or<br />\n\"being the spouse of a graduate<br />\nstudent.\" Dr. Godenne says these<br />\ngroups develop \"whenever<br />\nenough interest is shown.\"<br />\nIn addition to Dr. Godenne, the<br />\nbuilding is staffed by another<br />\nphysician, Dr. Albert Dreyfus,<br />\nfour full-time counselors, along<br />\nwith 70 volunteers providing two<br />\nto three hours a week. Steve<br />\nThompson, a volunteer peer<br />\ncounselor, remarks, \"The Peer<br />\nCounseling Service provides a<br />\ngood place to reassure<br />\nstudents. . .they're in the same<br />\nboat as many others.\" Dr.<br />\nGodenne stresses that the White<br />\nHouse is a rare University service<br />\nbecause it allows \"unlimited<br />\nvisits\". The first five are completely free, insurance and sliding<br />\ncharge covering more visits.<br />\nAbove all, Dr. Godenne insists<br />\nthat all visitors are treated in Absolute Confidentiality: no personal records whatsoever are<br />\naffected.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Godenne, a<br />\ntypical student presents her with<br />\n\"relatively<br />\nminor<br />\nproblems...roommate troubles,<br />\nfailed tests, lost boy or<br />\ngirlfriends.\" More severe problems include bulimia, anorexia<br />\nand drug/alcohol problems. The<br />\nlatter provides a completely free<br />\ncounseling. Additionally, Dr.<br />\nGodenne estimates that about 20<br />\nstudents a year \"suffer from major psychoses. . . manic depression, schizophrenia, and<br />\n<br />\nhe<br />\n<br />\ntute House<br />\n<br />\nparanoia, and of those,. . .three<br />\nor four require hospitalization.\"<br />\nIn given year, a relatively<br />\nlarge proportion of the student<br />\nbody visits the White House with<br />\na variety of problems. Specifically, the service sees \"12 percent<br />\nof undergraduates\" and \"20 percent of graduates\" during their<br />\ncollege stay, which corresponds<br />\nto about 600 students a year. The<br />\nlarger proportion of graduate<br />\nstudents is attributable to their<br />\n\"concerns about the future:<br />\nfinances and family. When you're<br />\nan undergraduate, you know<br />\nyou'll be out in 4 years,\" says<br />\nDr. Godenne, \"but some<br />\ngraduate students don't know<br />\nwhen they'll leave.\"<br />\nOverall, Dr. Godenne views<br />\nHopkins students as \"highly<br />\ncompetitive, bright. . .some narcissistic,\" which can lead to<br />\ndepression. To them, Dr.<br />\nGodenne candidly asks \"Why is<br />\n<br />\nit important to be the best?'\" Her<br />\nadvice to anxiety-stricken<br />\nstudents: \"Sleep, don't study all<br />\nnight. . .anxiety blocks the thinking process.\" She contends that<br />\nthis advice has never back-fired.<br />\nFor social or family problems,<br />\nshe suggests diversion via hobbies, merely taking time off, and<br />\nshe emphasizes \"to come here to<br />\ntalk...Nothing in life is<br />\nfinal. . .talk about it objectively.\"<br />\nSome students also have problems with sexual relationships or<br />\nexperiences. A virgin, may for<br />\nexample, \"fear homosexuality,\"<br />\nor some students are frightened<br />\nby a sexually active roommate.<br />\nShe points out, \"there are many<br />\nvirgins\" and \"less sex than bragging.\" This less casual approach<br />\nshe attributes to the herpes outbreak two years ago and the current phobia regarding an AIDS<br />\nepidemic.<br />\nWhile the pressure-filled<br />\n<br />\nHopkins environment may contribute to these psychological problems, Dr. Godenne says that<br />\nother universities such as<br />\nPrinceton, Villanova, and<br />\nRochester have acknowledged the<br />\nsame situations. Actually, about<br />\none of every four people will seek<br />\npsychological help during their<br />\nlifetime, so that the figures for<br />\nboth undergraduate (12 percent)<br />\nand graduate students (20 percent) show that college life may<br />\nnot contribute more than everyday life to psychological<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\nFor anyone with one of the<br />\naforementioned problems, or just<br />\na pervading depressed feeling, a<br />\nWhite House visit could make a<br />\ndifference.

At the start<br />\nof the progression of AIDS many<br />\npeople, such as hemophiliacs, acquired the disease through blood<br />\ntransfusions. Today, at least in<br />\nthe U.S., the blood is safe. Each<br />\ndonated pint of blood is screened<br />\nfor the presence of the HIV virus<br />\nor its antibodies.

It is important for the<br />\npublic to know that the disease<br />\ncannot be transmitted by casual<br />\ncontact.<br />\nIn the U.S. the disease has not<br />\nreached the \"hyperepidemic\"<br />\nproportions that it has in Africa.<br />\nHowever, the reasons for the<br />\n<br />\nprevalence of the disease are different. Here, homosexuality and<br />\nbisexuality play a large part in the<br />\ntransmission, but in Africa these<br />\nconcepts are barely known, let<br />\nalone practiced. In Africa, the<br />\nmedical and sanitary conditions<br />\nare responsible for the growth of<br />\nAIDS. There, a clinic will have<br />\nas few as 20 needles with which<br />\nto treat the 300 or so patients that<br />\ncome in on a given day.

And your<br />\nbiggest weakness?<br />\nA: My strengths, I believe, are<br />\nworking with Dick Enberg, and<br />\nalso my style at the end of a tight<br />\ngame, because then I'm coaching.<br />\nI don't second-guess. I give facts<br />\nbefore they happen, so I make as<br />\nmany mistakes as the coaches of<br />\nthe teams who are playing.<br />\nMy weakness is a lack of<br />\nvocabulary, and not knowing the<br />\nrules of the game. And, now and<br />\nthen, in a game I fade out, for<br />\nsome reason or another, if the<br />\ngame gets boring.<br />\nQ: Who's better behind the<br />\nmicrophone, you or Billy Packer?<br />\nAnd why?<br />\nA: I think that Billy is a better<br />\nanalyst, that he knows more about<br />\nthe game than I do, and that he<br />\nhas a greater love for the game<br />\nthan I do. The only difference is:<br />\nHe knows the business, Ifeel the<br />\nbusiness.<br />\nI think a lot of times, that Billy<br />\nis like a Great Clinician, whereas<br />\nI'm more for the \"barracks-ing,\"<br />\nthe cult type, sometimes almost<br />\ndisrespectful to the seriousness of<br />\nthe situation.<br />\nQ: Should. TV announcers be<br />\nawarded technical fouls?<br />\nA: If announcers were awarded<br />\ntechnical fouls, I'd be out of the<br />\ngame in the first seven minutes,<br />\njust as if I was a coach and got<br />\nthree fouls.<br />\nBut I do think a coach should,<br />\nin some ways, be able to put his<br />\n'two-cents-worth into things. I do<br />\nthink sometimes a referee subconsciously favors someone. One<br />\nof my hangups is that I always<br />\nroot for somebody who's losing.<br />\nI want OT, continuous OT. I'm<br />\nlike the handicappers at a horse<br />\nrace, where they are certain<br />\nweights on the horses\u2014I'd always<br />\ntry to handicap a game so it's a<br />\nbuzzer beater at the end.<br />\nAnd I also think that coaches<br />\nshould be able to have some feedback into the TV business, if they<br />\nreally think they're not getting<br />\nequal time, or if the camera is too<br />\nmuch on John's towel, or Digger's carnation.<br />\nQ: What's the biggest difference<br />\ncoaching<br />\nand<br />\nbetween<br />\nannouncing?<br />\nA: The biggest difference is that<br />\nthere's no ulcers. And you're not<br />\nhung in effigy. But then you don't<br />\nget the other side of it either. The<br />\ntremendous high of victory, the<br />\nwhite snow and the eagle. The<br />\nheights and depths just aren't as<br />\ngreat as the roller coaster ride<br />\nfrom the coaches' bench.<br />\n<br />\nQ: Why do you think Al McGuire<br />\nis successful?<br />\nA: I think first of all, because I<br />\n<br />\nlength love affair.<br />\nAlso, I was non-negotiable,<br />\nand I think I came along at the<br />\nright time\u2014in the late 1960's\u2014<br />\nfor my style of \"burn baby<br />\nburn,\" when people protested<br />\nand had grenades in their hands.<br />\nAnd I think the last three or<br />\nfour years of my coaching career,<br />\nmy success was a chain reaction<br />\nfrom what I did the first 10 years.<br />\nThis kid got me that kid, and my<br />\nstature built with the officials.<br />\nThe oldest coach always gets the<br />\nbreaks.<br />\n<br />\nlike myself. It's important to like<br />\nwho you are. And I love my<br />\nballplayers at a distance, an arm's<br />\n<br />\nFinally, I think my success had<br />\na lot to do with my seven years<br />\nat Belmont Abbey College,<br />\nbefore I came to Marquette.<br />\nThat's where I learned<br />\ncoaching\u2014to pick up the towels,<br />\nwrap the ankles, and drive the<br />\nbus. And that 's when I learned<br />\nthat the least important thing in<br />\ncoaching is the X's and O's. The<br />\nmost important thing is the family concept: there's no \"I\" in<br />\n\"Team\".<br />\nContinued on Page 26<br />\n<br />\nn his attempt to improve upon Uwenbrau's<br />\nformula for the best way in the world to brew beer,<br />\nAlbert stumbled upon another formula.<br />\n11!s<br />\nI<br />\nr7tik<br />\n!rip!<br />\n117VM<br />\n<br />\nkgkr<br />\n<br />\n,'\"\u2018\u2018 <,\u2022 Vs,<br />\n\u2022'<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022..'\u2022\u2022<br />\n,<br />\nA9<br />\nI0<br />\n--it\u2018k*<br />\n'N's \u2022I<br />\n'<br />\n\\P '<br />\nNTri<br />\n, .N,s<br />\n\"<br />\n\u2022 -Ns\u2022\u2022 *' '<br />\n\u2022<br />\n'\u2022<br />\n<br />\nIMMVIA<br />\nIIklIMITFOIVIIMINIMINIM<br />\n<br />\n< ';'s \u2022<br />\n<br />\nifOlik\u2018W\\<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\n.1,'\u2022,-<br />\n<br />\n*7<br />\n4k: tt.mt,-toNit.\u2022--7,t,<br />\n<br />\n,\u2018<br />\n..., .<br />\n., ..<br />\n-'..*<br />\n*<br />\n:.<br />\n:x\"<br />\n4<br />\n-\u2018itipiiii*<br />\nA.,..\u2022;N,:. - 4.- 1<br />\n;<br />\n:<br />\n,aviom<br />\n.

J. Bryan<br />\nHehir, a member of the United<br />\nStates Catholic Conference, in his<br />\nlecture titled \"Ethics and<br />\nStrategy: The Case of SDI\" in the<br />\nGarrett Room on March 9.<br />\nAccording to Hehir, the ethical<br />\ndebate regarding nuclear weapons<br />\nand war-fighting doctrine emerged in the 1980s. Moral considerations have become one of the key<br />\nissues in the nuclear debate. The<br />\nreverend elaborated on the four<br />\nmajor positions that compose the<br />\nethical debate.<br />\nThe first considers moral questions irrelevant to the policy<br />\narena. Those who espouse this<br />\nview believe that ethical considerations \"tell you nothing that<br />\nyou cannot learn in other ways.\"<br />\nThe second division believes<br />\nthat the moral argument, if it is<br />\ncorrect, can \"cut through the<br />\nstrategic argument. This<br />\nphilosophy is diametrically Onposed to that of the first.\"<br />\n\"Corruptive\" was the term<br />\nHehir used to label the third<br />\nperspective. According to this<br />\nanalysis, one can understand the<br />\n\"central moral principle is protecting civilians\", yet if this<br />\npremise is adhered to, \"you get<br />\nall the wrong strategic answers.\"<br />\nThe final manner in which<br />\nethical questions are considered is<br />\nthat they are complementary to<br />\nstrategic analysis. This ideology<br />\nbelieves that moral reasoning<br />\nregarding nuclear doctrines provides some insight that cannot be<br />\nattained from pure strategical<br />\nconsiderations. Hehir explained<br />\nthat \"the best way to engage in<br />\na discussion of SDI is through the<br />\ncomplementary notion.\"<br />\nThe morality of a defensive<br />\nsystem, he said, is based on<br />\ntechnical, strategic, economic,<br />\nand ethical analysis. Hehir went<br />\non to qualify this explanation.<br />\nAt the technical level, feasibility is the major question. Questions regarding the form such a<br />\nprogram would take and the ability of such a system to perform as<br />\npredicted must be answered.<br />\nThe reverend continued by saying that the strategic considerations include how the changes<br />\nwould effect the strategic balance<br />\nand whether such a system would<br />\nactually increase or decrease the<br />\nlikelihood of war. Alone, this<br />\nanalysis would not be considered<br />\nan argument of ethics, yet the outcome determines the ultimate<br />\nmoral question.<br />\nThe effect of such a program<br />\non the economy poses a great<br />\nethical question for policy makers<br />\nto deal with, according to Hehir.<br />\nWhere dollars are spent in the<br />\nface of a rising deficit adds additional dimension to the moral<br />\nargument, he said.<br />\nFinally, Hehir discussed the<br />\nnecessity of purely moral<br />\nargumentation. He offered no<br />\n\"final judgment\" on the Strategic<br /><br />\nJohn Misa<br /><br />\nThe Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, a member of the United States Catholic Conference, who delivered a lecture on the ethics and strategy of the Strategic<br />\nDefense Initiative.<br /><br />\nDefense Initiative yet he did say<br />\nthat he believed in \"the protection of civilians with absolute<br />\ncentrality.\"<br />\nHehir began by discussing the<br />\nhistorical perspectives on warfighting. He explained that<br />\nClauswitz, the Prussian General<br />\nwho believed that \"war is a rationally defensible activity\" and<br />\nAugustine, who believed that war<br />\nis not only rationally defensible<br />\npolitically but morally as well,<br />\n\"taught the West to think of war<br />\npolitics.\"<br />\nThere are two conflicting<br />\npremises from which the entire<br />\nnuclear debate stems, explained<br />\nHehir. One is that nuclear<br />\nweapons demand a \"radical<br />\ndiscontinuity\" from previous<br />\nstrategy decisions and ethical<br />\nconsiderations. The second is that<br />\nnuclear weapons require an extension of current strategy with no<br />\ntruly new questions.<br />\nThose who espouse the latter<br />\nbelief, he said, consider three<br />\n\"manifestations\" of the United<br />\nStates nuclear policy: limited<br />\nnuclear war, counterforce<br />\ntargeting, and defense. This<br />\ngroup \"attempts to think through<br />\nthe reality of the nuclear age.\"<br />\nHehir outlined the development<br />\nof each of these options. According to him, limited nuclear war<br />\nwas first considered by former<br />\nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger. The idea is fairly selfevident, said Hehir. A nuclear explosion could be detonated in a<br />\nparticular war zone and limited to<br />\nthat sphere, he said.<br />\nCounterforce, the paradigm<br />\nfirst advocated by former<br />\nSecretary of Defense Robert<br />\nMacNamara, now favored by the<br />\nundersecretary of defense, suggests a warfighting strategy which<br />\ndepends on second strike<br />\ncapabilities to retaliate against the<br />\nenemy after an initial nuclear<br />\nstrike occurs.<br />\nFinally, defense against nuclear<br /><br />\nweapons, a strategy favored by<br />\nthe President, includes antiballistic missiles and SDI. This<br />\nstrategy is \"an attempt to make<br />\nthese [nuclear] weapons fit into<br />\nclassical categories.\"<br />\nAfter<br />\nproviding<br />\nthis<br />\nbackground information, Hehir<br />\noutlined the progress which has<br />\nbeen made by nuclear strategists<br />\nsince the 1960s. The 1960s<br />\nbrought two main lines of thinking, he said. Paul Ramsey, said<br />\nHehir, believed that there exists<br />\nsuch a thing as \"justifiable use\".<br />\nJustifiable use leads to justifiable<br />\ndeterrent. \"Not that we have one<br />\nbut that it is possible to create.\"<br />\nexplained Hehir on Ramsey's<br />\nsentiments.<br />\nThe second philosophy was that<br />\nof Walter Stein. Hehir described<br />\nStein's argument as \"the counterpoint of Ramsey.\"<br />\nHehir explained that the discussions in the 1970s were led by<br />\nMichael Walters. His thoughts rejected the idea of use but not of<br />\ndeterrence.<br />\n\"The 1980s,\" declared Hehir,<br />\n\"brought theories of modifying<br />\ndeterrence.\" These ethicists do<br />\nnot reject or accept nuclear<br />\nstrategies. They are, according to<br />\nHehir, \"less confident than<br />\nRamsey yet not as opposed as<br />\nStein.\"<br />\nThe reverend himself supported the concept of a \"centimeter of ambiguity.\" This<br />\ntheory makes the eventual use of<br />\nsuch weapons \"not absolutely<br />\nimpossible.\"<br />\n\"Theories of deterrence are<br />\nunder attack from both the Left<br />\nand the Right,\" stated Hehir as<br />\nhe concluded the discussion of<br />\ndeterrence. The reverend explained that the increasing distrust of<br />\ndeterrence has led to the consideration of a defense posture to<br />\nreplace deterrence theories. Said<br />\nHehir, \"Reagan sees SDI as a<br />\nway out.\"<br /><br />\nLecture Series: Morality of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear War<br /><br />\nHarvard Prof Nye Analyzes<br />\nTrends in Nuclear Debate<br />\nby Jonathan Engler<br />\nSpeaking yesterday at the final<br />\ninstallment of the series titled,<br />\n\"The Morality of Nuclear<br />\nWeapons and Nuclear War, \"<br />\nwas Harvard University professor<br />\nof political science Joseph Nye.<br />\nThe director of Harvard's<br />\nCenter for International Affairs,<br />\nNye is a recognized national<br />\nfigure in the study of nuclear<br />\nethics.<br />\nNye began his lecture with an<br />\nanecdote about a man walking<br />\nalong a cliff, who then falls over<br />\nthe side. Grabbing a branch as he<br />\nis about to fall into the rocky surf,<br />\nthe man looked up the cliff and<br />\nasked if there was anyone there.<br />\nA voice yelled down to have<br />\nfaith, and let go. The man paused<br />\na moment, and asked if there was<br />\nanyone else there.<br />\nOn the realization that the total<br />\nexplosive power used in World<br />\nWar II is contained in a single<br />\nnuclear warhead today, Nye<br />\nstated that the public has been<br />\nconcerned with nuclear morality<br />\nfor quite some time.<br />\nFrom 1958 to 1962, he said,<br />\npublic awareness was at a very<br />\nhigh level because of the tensions<br />\nof the Cold War, which he said<br />\nculminated in the Cuban Missile<br />\nCrisis.<br />\nIn the following years, after the<br />\n1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban<br />\nTreaty, public concern waned,<br />\nonly to return with a vengeance<br />\nin the early 1980s. The failure of<br />\nthe Senate to ratify the Strategic<br />\nArms Limitation Talks Treaty<br />\nand the Reagan Administration<br />\nrhetoric in support of a strong<br />\ndefense accentuated his concern.<br />\nThe result of the public concern<br />\nwas a striking softening in the<br />\nReagan line from one of \"no<br />\ncompromise\" in 1980 to a more<br />\nmoderate stance today. The<br />\ndecline of public alarm since<br />\n1984 has been marked by the<br />\nReagan proposal to eliminate the<br />\nthreat of nuclear war through the<br />\nStrategic Defense Initiative, and<br />\nactive pursuit of a productive<br />\narms treaty in the years following his 1984 re-election.<br />\nNye noted a rising tide of<br />\npublic concern over the last<br />\ndecade, which he said transcends<br />\nthe shifting opinions of the 1960s.<br />\nOne reason he gave is that there<br />\nis considerable awareness now<br />\nthat nuclear weapons are not just<br />\nanother kind of artillery but a real<br />\nthreat to the existence of the<br />\nworld.<br />\nIn the 1960s, said Nye, there<br />\nwere two predominant schools of<br />\nthought, the strategic and the<br />\ntheological. Theologians argued<br />\nthat since nuclear weapons ex-<br /><br />\nCorrection<br />\nBecause ofa production error<br />\nin last week's News-Letter,<br />\nAndrew Chun 's Young Trustee<br />\nstatement was not printed and<br />\nWinston Vaughan 's statement<br />\nwas printed under Chun 's<br />\nname. The News-Letter<br />\napologizes for the error and<br />\nany inconvenience it caused.<br /><br />\nistence is based on the assumption<br />\nthat their use is immoral, whereas<br />\nthe strategists said that one should<br />\njudge the morality of the consequence of an action, rather than<br />\non intentions.<br />\nThe 1980s have brought a new<br />\nschool of thought, which Nye<br />\ncalled the \"anti-nuclear consequentialists.\" Their stand rests on<br />\nthe idea that we have no right to<br />\nbehave in ways that might<br />\npreclude the ability of future<br />\ngenerations to live. Given two<br />\nassumptions, the infallibility of<br />\nhumans and the Murphy's Law<br />\nthat anything that can happen<br />\nwill, the Consequentialists<br />\nbelieve that the possibility of conflict precludes any claim of<br />\nmorality on the part of nuclear<br />\ndeterrence.<br />\nThe leaders of the world appear<br />\nto be coming to the same conclusion, said Nye, as seen by the<br />\nnear agreement of Soviet Premier<br />\nMikhail Gorbachev and Reagan<br />\nin 1986 on the idea of eliminating<br />\nall nuclear weapons in ten years.<br />\nNye asked rhetorically if this<br />\nreasoning is compelling. He<br />\nfound the answer to be no.<br />\nFirst, Nye said the argument<br />\nrests on the view that we cannot<br />\nmake nuclear policy decisions<br />\nwhich will negatively affect<br />\nfuture generations. It is hard, he<br />\ncontinued, to decide what future<br />\ngenerations will want, but one<br />\ncan assume things like survival<br />\nwill be high on their list of<br />\npriorities.<br />\nHe said, though, that the condition of survival is not so simple. Differentiating between absolute and necessary reasons for<br />\nsurvival, Nye denied that man<br />\nsearches for absolute survival ,<br /><br />\npointing out that every time one<br />\ngets in a car one os trading off a<br />\nbit of absolute survival for<br />\nmobility.<br />\nNye continued that the highly<br />\ncontrolled situation between the<br />\nsuperpowers of their weapons<br />\nand open communication behind<br />\nthe scenes would appear to make<br />\nthe risk of a nation like Pakistan<br />\nusing the bomb much more likely than either the Soviet Union or<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nIn response to the question of<br />\nwhat to do about nuclear arms,<br />\nNye introduced an alternative to<br />\nthe traditional hawk and dove<br />\nperspectives called the \"owl,\"<br />\na school of thought that thinks the<br />\ntechnical entanglements and<br />\nmisunderstandings of World War<br />\nI are the most likely future cause<br />\nof a nuclear conflict today.<br />\nThe answer to immediate<br />\nnuclear policy would be to focus<br />\non short-term risks and their<br />\nreduction, he said. Nye went on<br />\nto describe a five-fold scheme of<br />\ndeterrence.<br />\n\"Self-defense alone is just a<br />\nlimited cause, \" said Nye. \"It<br />\ndoes, however, rule out foreign<br />\npolicy crusades in the modern<br />\nnuclear world.\"<br />\nTherefore, he said, statesmen<br />\nand diplomats must concentrate<br />\non more limited goals rather than<br />\non all-encompassing visions to<br />\nrule the world.<br />\n\"Secondly, you can never treat<br />\nnuclear weapons as normal<br />\nweapons, \" he said.

When the time comes for Council's<br />\nendorsement of SAC recipients, the annual<br />\nselection process usually breaks down to a<br />\nverbal free-for-all in which graduating<br />\nseniors get one last chance to stab each<br />\nother in the back. Last year was no exception. Council rejected the first list of thirtytwo recipients proposed by the SAC. The<br />\nSAC was then forced to trim the list down<br />\nto fourteen seniors. It was not a pretty sight.<br />\nThree years ago, in a similarly ugly<br />\nscene, Council members actually began to<br />\nhurl obscenitites at one another during the<br />\ndebate over the Seals.<br />\nThis year, the Student Activities Award<br />\nReview Committee was established to make<br />\nsure all the hoopla won't happen again. The<br />\ncommittee, which was formed last<br />\nsemester, investigated solutions to the Seal<br />\nproblem ranging from modifications to the<br />\nselection procedure rules, to creating an<br />\nalternative award, to bagging the idea of<br />\nstudent activity awards altogether. Unfortunately, the committee decided to recom-<br /><br />\nmend modifications.<br />\nWe can't argue with the details of the<br />\nchanges. Moving the process to an earlier<br />\ndate and insisting upon flexibility in the<br />\nselection system seems wise\u2014wise, that is,<br />\nif you agree with the premise of the committee which is: \"recognition [should] be<br />\ngiven to those students who have made<br />\noutstanding contributions to student<br />\nactivities.''<br />\nWe do not agree with that premise.<br />\nStudents shouldn't become involved in<br />\nactivities in order to be \"recognized\" at<br />\nthe end. Furthermore, there is no point in<br />\nruining one's last days at Hopkins because<br />\nof a ridiculously trivial award.<br />\nRecent history at Homewood has shown<br />\nyear after year that there is no way to<br />\n\"honor\" students for their participation in<br />\nstudent activities without creating turmoil.<br />\nWhile the modifications to the selection<br />\nprocess proposed by the committee may<br />\nmake the process a little easier logistically, feelings will undoubtedly be hurt this<br />\nyear as always.<br />\nNow, the SAC and Council seem headed for another showdown over the Seals,<br />\nif not this year, then next year. We can't<br />\nhelp wondering how many more ugly fights<br />\nwill be necessary before the Seals are<br />\nscrapped.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nAn Absolute Right<br />\nTo the Editor<br />\nYou have no reason for shame<br />\nwith regard to the recent Terwilliger affair. You took positive<br />\naction to confirm Mr. Terwilliger's views and printed them<br />\nin an open forum. You acted in<br />\na responsible manner and upheld<br />\nhis freedom of expression.<br />\nBy misrepresenting himself and<br />\nabusing the forum, Mr. Terwilliger demonstrated one of<br />\nDemocracy's highest values: his<br />\nabsolute right to make a fool of<br />\nhimself.<br />\nDon Braswell<br /><br />\nBurden of a Crack-pot<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nJoseph D. Terwilliger has<br />\nplayed on my emotions in order<br />\nto prove his point. He felt it<br />\nnecessary to abuse the freedom of<br />\nexpression on this campus by<br />\ntargeting the local Jewish community with a letter denying the<br />\nHolocaust\u2014solely to see if it<br />\nwould be printed, and to elicit a<br />\nresponse.<br />\nWith freedom of expression,<br />\nwe must accept the burden of an<br />\noccasional crackpot that abuses<br />\nthe system. Joseph D. Terwilliger, how many morals and<br />\nemotions is it necessary to<br /><br />\ndisregard in order to show that<br />\nfree speech does exist?<br />\nHeinan Landa<br />\nThe writer is the Co-President of<br />\nthe Jewish Students Association<br /><br />\nCommending the N-L<br /><br />\nI speak on behalf of Pi Sigma<br />\nAlpha when I say I was truly<br />\nshocked and disappointed to<br />\ndiscover that the Academic Council had rejected the recommendation of the Political Science<br />\nDepartment and denied Dr.<br />\nDavid's promotion.<br />\nAny C.I.P. student will attest to<br />\nProfessor David's outstanding<br />\nability to teach. His dedication to<br />\nthe University is illustrated by his<br />\ndevotion to establishing an International Studies Program which<br />\nhas become the second largest<br />\nmajor at Hopkins.<br />\nIt seems the only aspect which<br />\nthe Academic Council can question, is whether Dr. David's<br />\nresearch meets the standards of<br />\nquality and volume set forth by<br />\nthe University. However, this<br />\nquestion was resolutely affirmed<br />\nDepartment<br />\nthe<br />\nwhen<br />\nUNANIMOUSLY supported<br />\nDavid's promotion. Who can better apply these standards than the<br />\nmen and women who have<br />\nthemselves met the University's<br />\ncriteria? Clearly, Dr. David has<br />\nthe support of the faculty and student body. This can only lead one<br />\nto believe that his denied promotion was due to yet another tangle<br />\nin the University's medusan<br />\nbureaucracy.<br />\nI join the members of Pi Sigma<br />\nAlpha in imploring the Academic<br />\nCouncil to reconsider its decision<br />\nregarding Dr. David's promotion. Futhermore, I urge each individual member to recall Daniel<br />\nCoit Gilman's dream for a<br />\nUniversity where knowledge is a<br />\ndynamic force. If Professor<br />\nDavid's work has stirred any controversy in the academic community, I applaud it as an indication of creative inquiry rather<br />\nthan static recitation.<br /><br />\nMembers of the Academic<br />\nCouncil,<br />\nIn 1874 Daniel Coit Gilman<br />\nproposed before a Board of<br />\nTrustees a University which<br />\nwould regard knowledge as \"a<br />\ndynamic living force in human affairs rather than a revered<br />\nhistorical document.\" In this<br />\ndesire the Trustees heartily concurred and formally elected Dr.<br />\nGilman as the first president of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nEvery once in a great while, a<br />\nstudent will find an instructor<br />\nwho embodies this vision. It is indeed a rare privilege when one<br />\nencounters the professor who can<br />\nturn a lecture into a thoughtprovoking inquiry as opposed to<br />\na tedious transfer of information.<br />\nThe members of the Gamma Rho<br />\nchapter of Pi Sigma Alpha (The<br />\nNational Political Science Honor<br />\nSociety) feel that Dr. Stephen R.<br />\nDavid is such a scholar.<br />\nCombining a clear grasp of the<br />\ninternational milieu with a<br />\nrefreshing sense of humor, David<br />\nis without a doubt one of the most<br />\nadmired instructors at the University. His lectures are consistently organized and well-integrated<br />\nwith current events. Outside the<br />\nclassroom, his courses are<br />\nchallenging and require rigorous<br />\nstudy but the demands he puts on<br />\nhis students are no more than he<br />\nexpects from himself. In this way<br />\nhe has earned the respect of his<br />\nhas no place in the press. Ter- pupils.<br />\nwilliger did indeed \"make a<br />\nmockery of this forum and the<br />\nprinciple of freedom of expression.\" I applaud the News-Letter<br />\nTimothy McNamara<br />\nfor handling this event<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nprofessionally.<br />\nGlen Weiss<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br /><br />\nMeredith Jacobson<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nSneezing on Muller<br />\nI would like to commend the<br />\nNews-Letter for the way in which<br />\nit dealt with the controversy<br />\nfollowing Joseph Terwilliger's<br />\npreposterous letter. First of all,<br />\nthe News-Letter had not only the<br />\nright but the responsibility to print<br />\nTerwilliger's first letter. If the<br />\nmedia only relayed the views and<br />\ninformation which coincided with<br />\nthe opinions of the majority, imagine what a mild, biased report<br />\nwould result. Contrary to some of<br />\nthe angry responses which you<br />\nreceived, freedom of expression<br />\ndoes include the expression of unpopular ideas. Note that even<br />\nthose letters which criticized the<br />\nNews-Letter were printed, including those by Mr. Jonah<br />\nCohen, who seemed to imply that<br />\nthe News-Letter could be guilty of<br />\nlibel by association.<br />\nSecond, the News-Letter dealt<br />\nadmirably with Terwilliger's second letter, in which he justified<br />\nthe first with the pretense of proving \"the hypocritical nature of<br />\nour belief in freedom.\" This kind<br />\nof blatant manipulation is irresponsible and dangerous, and<br /><br />\nThefollowing is the text ofa letter written to the Academic Counoil by Chrysso B. Sarkos, the<br />\npresident of the Gamma Rho<br />\nChapter of the Pi Sigma Alpha<br />\nNational Political Honor Society.<br />\nIt is printed here with the consent<br />\nof the writer.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHaving graduated some time<br />\nago, I rarely read the NewsLetter. When I come across a<br />\ncopy, I skim it quickly as a<br />\nnostalgic spectator. However, I<br />\ncannot ignore the denial of promotion to Dr. David. Through<br />\nthe years, Hopkins has occasionally done things which make<br />\nme ashamed to admit my association with the school. Denying<br />\ntenure to Steven David is certainly one of them.<br />\nHe is one of the most popular<br />\nprofessors because he is one of<br />\nthe best. His classes are enjoyable<br />\nnot only because he is cute, not<br />\nonly because he is a lively and enthusiastic lecturer, but also<br />\nbecause he is extremely intelligent and very thorough. He<br />\npresents the concepts of political<br />\nscience from every angle. He<br />\nreminds undergraduates that \"interesting lecture\" is not a contradiction in terms.<br />\nContinued on Page 12<br /><br />\nAaron Davis, Flory Ware<br />\nJonathan Engler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jon Stempel<br />\nLoren Fox, Laurah Limbrick<br />\nJay Lechtman<br />\nEly Brown, Joseph Gergyes<br />\nVandana Kumra<br />\nChristopher Szeles, Adam Warner<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nJess Bunshaft, Ganesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\nEditor<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nLayout Editors<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nFeatures Editor<br />\nScience Editors<br />\nBooks Editor<br />\nSports Editors<br />\nCopy Editors<br />\nPhoto Editors<br /><br />\nStaff Writers: Uri Ahn, L.

Before<br />\nLetterman even begins the evening, most places have closed.<br />\nWhy? Hopkins has a large<br />\nenough community to support at<br />\nleast one late-night joint, especially since this demented group<br />\nsimply loves staying up late to<br />\nstudy and so many of us live offcampus in the Charles Village<br />\nneighborhood, unable to even<br />\nboil an egg. There are four drycleaners along St. Paul. The<br />\nGiant at the Rotunda is crowded<br />\nat two in the morning. Is a simple little restaurant too much to<br />\nask? Pizza delivery is already a<br />\ncrowded field, and the market can<br />\ntake only so much pepperoni.

As it<br />\nis now, the closest place is on<br />\nGreenmount Avenue, and it's not<br />\nthe safest place to be wandering<br />\naround. The only problem is integrating an ugly fast-food place<br />\nwith the neighborhood, a<br />\nlegitimate worry although it is<br />\nusually used by established places<br />\nto ward off competition. Some<br />\nwould argue the neighborhood<br />\nisn't good-looking to begin with,<br />\nso no damage could be done.

At<br />\nleast you're showing some<br />\nforethought before you commit<br />\nrelationship murder.<br />\nWhat we're dealing with here,<br />\nis a fragile, elusive, vulnerable<br />\nlittle creature frequently called<br />\n\"the male ego.\" A frightened little thing, this housepet, \"the male<br />\nego,\" thrives under loving care,<br />\ntender petting, and constant<br />\nfeedings. Unlike the female ego,'<br />\nwhich is quite durable from frequent abuse and blows equivalent<br />\nto that of a battering ram, the<br />\nmale ego is much more sensitive.<br />\nYou must be careful in handling<br />\nthis creature, for one good, verbal whack will send it scurrying<br />\nfor cover underneath the<br /><br />\nby Londa Holsinger<br /><br />\nchairs that aren't attached to the<br />\ntables, with silverware, a menu,<br />\nservers and absolutely no ferns.<br />\nThere are restaurants in the area,<br />\nArmand's and Casey's, but<br />\nneither stays open for insomniacs.<br />\nThere are also bars like Pis and<br />\nCharles Village Pub. While they<br />\nserve food, some of it well worth<br />\nit, they are more bars than<br />\nrestaurants: too loud, catering to<br />\na definite crowd, and hampered<br />\nby laws regarding alcohol. A<br />\nrestaurant, where, for example,<br />\nan omelette could be had, would<br />\nneed to have low prices, fast service and a large menu. That<br />\nalmost sounds like asking too<br />\nmuch, so throwing in \"open all<br />\nnight\" may place it beyond all<br />\nhope, but there are places which<br />\nmanage to do it. Whether it's a<br />\ngreasy spoon type of place or a<br />\nDenny's, it would have a following. Perhaps Gampy's will see the<br />\nwisdom of bringing uptown a<br />\ncheaper, open-all-night, even better version of their successful<br />\nyuppie hangout.<br />\n(3) A cafe, cheap and intimate.<br />\nFor what it is, the Gilman Coffee Shop is wonderful.

That hardly makes<br />\nfor a good meal. So the Coffee<br />\nShop is not in the running. But<br />\nthis is still the most modest of the<br />\nthree suggestions. It could actually be pulled off by the University. Something like the Snack Bar<br />\nwould do it, but in a better location and with, again, longer<br />\nhours.

His earlier public<br />\nmisrepresentations, we learn<br /><br />\nfrom his second letter (N-L<br />\n3-6-87), were but a sleight of<br />\nhand with which he unveiled our<br />\nhypocrisies vis-a-vis the Freedom<br />\nof Expression uproar. His first<br />\nletter, he says, was a fable, but<br />\nit did not lack a moral.<br />\nThe apparent purpose of the<br />\nruse was to determine the degree<br />\nto which the Hopkins community approximates one of the three<br />\ntypes of totalitarian society Terwilliger is able to think of, Nazi,<br />\nCommunist, or \"etc.\" The proposition he employs is a simple<br />\none: if the N-L refuses to print my<br />\n(fraudulent) letter, then campus<br />\nsociety is either Nazi. Communist, or etc.<br />\nI am having the greatest difficulty imagining the Nazi society that would not welcome Terwilliger's (first) letter, and since<br />\na child could discern that our<br />\ncampus is not a Communist cell,<br />\nI am grateful to the N-L for having dispelled, by the simple act of<br />\nprinting the letter, any suggestion<br />\nthat we are living in a totalitarian<br />\nsociety named by a Latin<br />\nabbreviation.<br />\nThere are, however, less<br />\npositive aspects of Terwilliger's<br />\nchicanery. His actions were<br />\npredicated on a gutwash of halfbaked premises, but he was willing, nonetheless, to invest a<br />\nsubstantial amount of time and<br />\nenergy into their execution, if not<br />\ninto considering their implications and probable effects.

There are over 92,000<br />\nJews in Baltimore who, along<br />\nwith help from the University, aid<br />\nthe JSA in their activities. In recent years, Judaism as a whole<br />\nhas suffered something of an<br />\nidentity crisis. The fundamental<br />\nquestion, \"What does it mean to<br />\nbe Jewish?\" may have something<br />\nof an answer in the JSA. With<br />\neducational programs, social<br />\nevents and cultural activities relevant to Jewish life, the JSA hopes<br />\nto make JHU students more conscious of their cultural and<br />\nreligious heritage.<br />\nThe JSA is by no means a purely religious organization,<br />\nhowever. Of course, there are<br />\nregular services as well as those<br />\non the High Holy days, but the<br />\nJSA extends far beyond that<br />\naspect of Jewish life. Few, if any<br />\nclubs, are as active as the JSA,<br />\nwhich organizes two to three<br />\nfunctions per week.

They<br />\nare a group constantly asking of<br />\neach other, Are you all right?\"<br />\nThey have good reason to<br />\nworry.<br />\nHenry is not only a playwright,<br />\nbut an intellectual heavyweight<br />\nalternately proud and embarrassed of liking American pop music<br />\nfrom the sixties. His lines are<br />\nalmost as good as those in his<br />\nplay, which is high camp more<br />\nthan anything. The sensitive<br />\nromantic type, he is abused by<br />\nboth Charlotte and Annie. His<br />\nplay tells of the past and predicts<br />\nthe future, his salvation is in his<br />\nmusic, and he worries too much,<br />\nin the end either flipping his emotions with unexpected ease or<br />\nsimply being manipulated with<br /><br />\nsurprising ignorance of things.<br />\nFor his part, Long's debut on the<br />\nHopkins stage is appropriate,<br />\nbelievable and energetic. It is only when he lowers his voice to<br />\nmake a speech that he lowers his<br />\nmessage. A fine passage about<br />\nwriting, a tough subject for<br />\ndrama, is weakened by this<br />\nartifice.<br />\nOf Annie he says that he has<br />\nnever met anyone so silly. She<br />\nbegins as a crazy woman intent on<br />\nhaving the affair, saying it is after<br />\nall only two marriages and a kid<br />\nat stake. But she changes, becoming petulant, chaotic. She never<br />\nliked Henry for his mind and,<br />\nafter they do have an affair and<br />\ncontinue having it, she comes to<br />\nthe point of being angry that<br />\nHenry finishes her sentences.<br />\nGerry does a better job with Annie on the make.<br />\nShe is radiant. Loud, often just<br />\nabout to laugh (perhaps too<br />\noften), passionate: this is a polished performance (returned to with<br />\na later affair). Distraught, arguing, outraged: this is ranting, a<br />\nperformance better left unpolished. This is not to be harsh about<br />\nthe later Annie, if only the<br />\nvolume were turned down a bit.<br />\nIt may simply be the script. Artist and actors are a difficult subject. If there is a weakness in the<br />\notherwise admirable plot, it is a<br />\ncertain roughness and suddenness, jerking the characters all<br />\nover in the later scenes. The<br />\nscript does not sustain its focus.<br />\nWhen Henry and Annie, Max and<br />\nCharlotte are gathered together in<br /><br />\nJeremy Golub and Elena Schiro in The Real Thing.<br /><br />\nthe second scene, the play is tightly put together. It wanders later,<br />\nalways good. but veering off now<br />\nand then.<br />\nBoth the character of Max and<br />\nthe actor Jeremy Golub deserve<br />\nappearances in more of the<br />\nscenes, Max having some of the<br />\nplay's best lines in the opening<br />\nscene, offering them by flailing<br />\nlike a madman and Golub delivering two fine performances.

By flicking<br />\ndip all over the place, Max<br />\ndistracts the audience with cheap<br />\nslapstick when the dialogue<br />\ndeserves to be heard. A wellplaced source says that the flying<br />\ndip was intentional, although not<br />\nall of the players were notified in<br />\nadvance of the spectacle; it will<br />\nundoubtedly play differently the<br />\nnext time.

Those which survive are further subject to the<br />\nprivations of self-justification.<br />\nWhat emerges may indeed be<br />\nwhat the rememberer believes to<br />\nbe true, and at the same time<br />\nfall far afield of THE TRUTH,an<br />\nideal which no one meets or much<br />\nexpects to. So, it falls to the<br />\nhistorian to hear what he may,<br />\nand form that which determines<br />\nwhat he will believe.<br />\nThis problem forms the crux of<br />\nMario Vargas Llosa's The Real<br />\nLife of Alejandro Mayta. Llosa<br />\naddresses the issue very directly.<br />\nnarrator/quasi-main<br />\nThe<br />\ncharacter expalins that he is<br />\nwriting a fictionalized account of<br />\nthe life of a friend, who participated in an attempted leftist<br />\nrevolution more than twenty<br />\nyears previously. He then leads the<br />\nreader through a string of interviews which provide widely<br />\ndisparate accounts of events, but<br />\nalways with enough corroborating detail to prevent their<br />\n_being ruled out as obviously<br /><br />\nfalse. Each speaker presents a<br />\nversion of the truth which best<br />\nserves his or her interests. All<br />\nseem ready to lay most, if not all<br />\nthe blame for mistakes and<br />\nfailures at the feet of Mayta, the<br />\nerstwhile protagonist of the story.<br />\nParallel to the interviews, there<br />\nruns a narration of the same, or<br />\nroughly contemporaneous, events<br />\nas those covered by the interviews which is presented out of<br />\nquotes. The implication clearly is<br />\nthat this account is either THE<br />\nTRUTH, or else the interpretation and synthesis of facts in the<br />\nmind of the narrator. Which is actually the case is never made<br />\nclear. This is the beginning of the<br />\nconfusion which permeates The<br />\nReal Life and which at times<br />\nmakes the book extremely difficult to follow.<br />\nIt becomes painfully obvious<br />\nthat trouble is on the way when<br />\none realizes that all speakers and<br />\nall voices are presented in the<br />\nsame format, i.e. there are no<br />\nchanges in type-face or chapter<br />\nsubdivisions to act as guideposts.<br />\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that voices<br />\nspeak interlinearly. One line from<br />\nan interview is followed by one<br />\nline of dialogue from THE<br />\nTRUTH is followed by one line<br />\nof Mayta's thoughts in the first<br />\nperson which appear now and<br />\nagain just to make sure that the<br />\nreader understands that not all<br />\nfirst person references need be<br />\nfrom the subjective 'truth.'<br /><br />\nFrameworks for the action and of<br />\nthe speakers and their relationships to reality form in the<br />\nreader's mind only to be shattered<br />\ntwo pages later.<br />\nWhile presenting this convoluted picture of past events,<br />\nfilled with contradictions and<br />\njustifications, the narrator also<br />\nkeeps up a running commentary<br />\non \"current\" events taking place<br />\nin a fictionalized Peru. It is a<br />\ncountry in dire economic and<br />\nHuge<br />\nstraits.<br />\npolitical<br />\nneighborhoods of shacks fester in<br />\nLima while the right-wing<br />\nmilitary government attempts to<br />\nend internal violence and prevent<br />\nexternal interference. Depictions<br />\nof modern guerilla violence are<br />\nmixed in with the rest of the text<br />\nand sometimes seem indistinguishable from past events.<br />\nThis co-mingling is entirely intentional as the narrator attempts to<br />\ndraw a parallel between the<br />\nearlier, unsuccessful revolution<br />\nand the current one, which shows<br />\nsigns of being much more<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nThrough all the twists and turns<br />\nof the plot, Mayta remains<br />\nsomething of an enigma. It is<br />\n\u2022 readily obvious that he is a Trotskyist revolutionary in a tiny<br />\nsplinter party. The earnest\u2014and<br />\nundoubtedly true to life\u2014<br />\ndiscussions about the ideological<br />\nimplications of the name of the<br />\nparty newspaper (\"Workers<br />\nVoice-T [for Trotskyist, to<br />\ndistinguish it from the less revolu-<br /><br />\ntionary \"Workers Voice\" with<br />\nno TI) and about the role of a true<br />\nvanguard party provide amusing<br />\nspots in an otherwise bleak picture. Mayta's place in the party<br />\nis unassailable until he proves<br />\nhimself traitorous by meeting<br />\nwith a mainline Stalinist Communist. His real sin, however, is<br />\nhis desire to act to bring about the<br />\nrevolution, while his comrades<br />\nseem resigned or even relieved<br />\nthat the party should remain conspiratorial and theoretical. When<br />\npresented with a chance to act,<br />\nMayta seizes it and sees it through<br />\nto the end. His failure seals his<br />\nplace in the memory of his former<br />\nparty comrades, who are shown<br />\nthrough their interviews with the<br />\nnarrator to have sold out to the<br />\nsystem in exchange for a comfortable place in it.<br />\nTaken in a sentence- and<br />\nsometimes paragraph-length<br />\ndoses. Llosa can produce very<br />\nvivid images of setting. Par-<br /><br />\nticularly good are his descriptions<br />\nof the squalor and garbage in the<br />\nslums of Lima and of the aftermath of an attack on an Andean<br />\nvillage, complete with burning<br />\nbodies and circling vultures.<br />\nSmall details relating to how people try to maintain a bizarre normality under siege conditions<br />\nbuild up slowly until they come<br />\ncrashing in the relative traquility<br />\nof the period in which Mayta's<br />\nabortive revolution was to have<br />\ntaken place. In the end, the connection between the two revolutions is perhaps not as clear as<br />\nLlosa might have liked, but nevertheless, each makes its own<br />\nimpact.<br />\nJohn Updike is quoted on the<br />\ncover of Real Life as saying that<br />\nMario Vargas Llosa has replaced Gabriel Garcia Marquez as the<br />\nSouth American author for<br />\ngringos to catch up on, and I<br />\nagree.

The Homewood community has recently demonstrated its commitment to that principle by its response to events centering on the construction of shanties on campus during the past year.<br />\nFollowing months of debate, a faculty committee has issued a preliminary<br />\nreport on freedom of expression which illustrates the difficulty of characterizing the limits on that freedom. Like any other freedom, that of expression is<br />\ndelicate; it flourishes in an environment of mutual tolerance, respect and<br />\nopen debate, but withers in a climate which fosters secretive attacks on<br />\nlegitimate forms of expression.<br />\nWe believe that the Homewood community will find actions such as the<br />\ndefacing of posters a caricature of academic freedom, inimicable to the<br />\nacademic enterprise. If those responsible have legitimate views they wish to<br />\nexpress, we urge them to do so openly, in the spirit of free debate, rather<br />\nthan adopting tactics which inhibit open discourse.<br />\nGeorge W.

Since ,<br />\n1973, Dr. Ghislaine Godenne has<br />\ndirected the center, and she<br />\nassumed control of all clinical<br />\nservices at Hopkins in 1978.<br />\nA M.D. graduate from Louvain, Belgium, where she had<br />\nbeen president of the student<br />\nbody, Dr. Godenne arrived from<br />\nEurope on a Fulbright Scholarship. Since then she has obtained<br />\nextensive training in pediatrics,<br />\nresearch<br />\nand<br />\npediatric<br />\nchild/adolescent/adult psychiatry.<br />\nIn 1962, she became the first<br />\nfemale chief resident while in the<br />\ndepartment of psychiatry at Johns<br />\nHospital.<br />\nHer<br />\nHopkins<br />\ndistinguished career also includes<br />\na recent decoration as Officer of<br />\nthe Order of Leopold for her<br />\nadolescent psychiatry research,<br />\nand presidency of the American<br />\nSociety of Adolescent Psychiatry.<br />\nThe White House provides different treatments for various<br />\npsychological problems. Usually,<br />\nstudents seeking help are<br />\nevaluated and then referred for<br />\npsychotherapy. Depending on the<br />\nevaluation, this can take the form<br />\nof individual therapy with a<br />\ncounselor, or medication from a<br />\npracticing psychiatrist. Group<br /><br />\ntherapy, with 5 or 6 participants,<br />\ncan be helpful for students sharing the same problem; e.g.,<br />\n\"terrible anxiety over a test\" or<br />\n\"being the spouse of a graduate<br />\nstudent.\" Dr. Godenne says these<br />\ngroups develop \"whenever<br />\nenough interest is shown.\"<br />\nIn addition to Dr. Godenne, the<br />\nbuilding is staffed by another<br />\nphysician, Dr. Albert Dreyfus,<br />\nfour full-time counselors, along<br />\nwith 70 volunteers providing two<br />\nto three hours a week. Steve<br />\nThompson, a volunteer peer<br />\ncounselor, remarks, \"The Peer<br />\nCounseling Service provides a<br />\ngood place to reassure<br />\nstudents. . .they're in the same<br />\nboat as many others.\" Dr.<br />\nGodenne stresses that the White<br />\nHouse is a rare University service<br />\nbecause it allows \"unlimited<br />\nvisits\". The first five are completely free, insurance and sliding<br />\ncharge covering more visits.<br />\nAbove all, Dr. Godenne insists<br />\nthat all visitors are treated in Absolute Confidentiality: no personal records whatsoever are<br />\naffected.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Godenne, a<br />\ntypical student presents her with<br />\n\"relatively<br />\nminor<br />\nproblems...roommate troubles,<br />\nfailed tests, lost boy or<br />\ngirlfriends.\" More severe problems include bulimia, anorexia<br />\nand drug/alcohol problems. The<br />\nlatter provides a completely free<br />\ncounseling. Additionally, Dr.<br />\nGodenne estimates that about 20<br />\nstudents a year \"suffer from major psychoses. . . manic depression, schizophrenia, and<br /><br />\nhe<br /><br />\ntute House<br /><br />\nparanoia, and of those,. . .three<br />\nor four require hospitalization.\"<br />\nIn given year, a relatively<br />\nlarge proportion of the student<br />\nbody visits the White House with<br />\na variety of problems. Specifically, the service sees \"12 percent<br />\nof undergraduates\" and \"20 percent of graduates\" during their<br />\ncollege stay, which corresponds<br />\nto about 600 students a year. The<br />\nlarger proportion of graduate<br />\nstudents is attributable to their<br />\n\"concerns about the future:<br />\nfinances and family. When you're<br />\nan undergraduate, you know<br />\nyou'll be out in 4 years,\" says<br />\nDr. Godenne, \"but some<br />\ngraduate students don't know<br />\nwhen they'll leave.\"<br />\nOverall, Dr. Godenne views<br />\nHopkins students as \"highly<br />\ncompetitive, bright. . .some narcissistic,\" which can lead to<br />\ndepression. To them, Dr.<br />\nGodenne candidly asks \"Why is<br /><br />\nit important to be the best?'\" Her<br />\nadvice to anxiety-stricken<br />\nstudents: \"Sleep, don't study all<br />\nnight. . .anxiety blocks the thinking process.\" She contends that<br />\nthis advice has never back-fired.<br />\nFor social or family problems,<br />\nshe suggests diversion via hobbies, merely taking time off, and<br />\nshe emphasizes \"to come here to<br />\ntalk...Nothing in life is<br />\nfinal. . .talk about it objectively.\"<br />\nSome students also have problems with sexual relationships or<br />\nexperiences. A virgin, may for<br />\nexample, \"fear homosexuality,\"<br />\nor some students are frightened<br />\nby a sexually active roommate.<br />\nShe points out, \"there are many<br />\nvirgins\" and \"less sex than bragging.\" This less casual approach<br />\nshe attributes to the herpes outbreak two years ago and the current phobia regarding an AIDS<br />\nepidemic.<br />\nWhile the pressure-filled<br /><br />\nHopkins environment may contribute to these psychological problems, Dr. Godenne says that<br />\nother universities such as<br />\nPrinceton, Villanova, and<br />\nRochester have acknowledged the<br />\nsame situations. Actually, about<br />\none of every four people will seek<br />\npsychological help during their<br />\nlifetime, so that the figures for<br />\nboth undergraduate (12 percent)<br />\nand graduate students (20 percent) show that college life may<br />\nnot contribute more than everyday life to psychological<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\nFor anyone with one of the<br />\naforementioned problems, or just<br />\na pervading depressed feeling, a<br />\nWhite House visit could make a<br />\ndifference.

At the start<br />\nof the progression of AIDS many<br />\npeople, such as hemophiliacs, acquired the disease through blood<br />\ntransfusions. Today, at least in<br />\nthe U.S., the blood is safe.

Here, homosexuality and<br />\nbisexuality play a large part in the<br />\ntransmission, but in Africa these<br />\nconcepts are barely known, let<br />\nalone practiced. In Africa, the<br />\nmedical and sanitary conditions<br />\nare responsible for the growth of<br />\nAIDS.

A<br />\npsychological 20 questions, sort<br />\nof, while you're all beefing<br />\nyourself up for the checkered flag<br />\nlap.<br />\nQ: What's your biggest strength<br />\nas a TV announcer? And your<br />\nbiggest weakness?<br />\nA: My strengths, I believe, are<br />\nworking with Dick Enberg, and<br />\nalso my style at the end of a tight<br />\ngame, because then I'm coaching.<br />\nI don't second-guess. I give facts<br />\nbefore they happen, so I make as<br />\nmany mistakes as the coaches of<br />\nthe teams who are playing.<br />\nMy weakness is a lack of<br />\nvocabulary, and not knowing the<br />\nrules of the game.

And you're not<br />\nhung in effigy. But then you don't<br />\nget the other side of it either. The<br />\ntremendous high of victory, the<br />\nwhite snow and the eagle. The<br />\nheights and depths just aren't as<br />\ngreat as the roller coaster ride<br />\nfrom the coaches' bench.<br /><br />\nQ: Why do you think Al McGuire<br />\nis successful?<br />\nA: I think first of all, because I<br /><br />\nlength love affair.<br />\nAlso, I was non-negotiable,<br />\nand I think I came along at the<br />\nright time\u2014in the late 1960's\u2014<br />\nfor my style of \"burn baby<br />\nburn,\" when people protested<br />\nand had grenades in their hands.<br />\nAnd I think the last three or<br />\nfour years of my coaching career,<br />\nmy success was a chain reaction<br />\nfrom what I did the first 10 years.<br />\nThis kid got me that kid, and my<br />\nstature built with the officials.<br />\nThe oldest coach always gets the<br />\nbreaks.<br /><br />\nlike myself. It's important to like<br />\nwho you are. And I love my<br />\nballplayers at a distance, an arm's<br /><br />\nFinally, I think my success had<br />\na lot to do with my seven years<br />\nat Belmont Abbey College,<br />\nbefore I came to Marquette.<br />\nThat's where I learned<br />\ncoaching\u2014to pick up the towels,<br />\nwrap the ankles, and drive the<br />\nbus. And that 's when I learned<br />\nthat the least important thing in<br />\ncoaching is the X's and O's.
