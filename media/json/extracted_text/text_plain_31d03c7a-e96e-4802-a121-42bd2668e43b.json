That was high<br />\nschool stuff. But here I was in<br />\ncollege and not only was I seeing it<br />\nbut I was having it shouted in my<br />\nears throughout my first weeks<br />\nhere. In short, I was depressed, for<br />\nI felt sure that those notions of<br />\ncongenital superiority had been<br />\nleft behind along with high school<br />\nprincipals and detention.<br />\nMeeting Savitz wasn't as<br />\ntranscendental an experience as I<br />\nhad anticipated. I spoke to him for<br />\nthe first time when he strolled into<br />\nthe News-Letter office, sometime<br />\nin mid-September. He was very<br />\ninformal, very willing to talk, in<br />\nsome respects a journalist's dream a fellow in a position of authority<br />\nwho actually liked to sit down and<br />\ntalk, who liked to wax polemic. He<br />\nenjoyed speaking perhaps because<br />\nthe topic was usually himself, and<br />\nhe did so effervescently, bubbling<br />\nforth with congested prose which<br />\nwas plainly contrived yet<br />\n<br />\npleasantly vernacular; and it was<br />\nappropriate, for Savitz addresses<br />\nhimself to a popular, sometimes<br />\nuncultured, and philistine<br />\naudience.<br />\nIt's Customary, bordering on<br />\nprerequisite, for politicians to have<br />\nhigh self-esteem quotients, but this<br />\nman was impudent. After hearing<br />\nhim speak for thirty minutes I<br />\nrealized that he does so in an<br />\noverbearing voice, even his<br />\nconversational tone is of<br />\nexceptionally loud volume. He<br />\nstrutted around a great deal,<br />\nhitting things, laughing raucously,<br />\nand out of context, enacting<br />\nhumorous conceits to get<br />\nattention. Strange. Piaget's theory<br />\nof the overcompensative psyche.<br />\nInsecurity on Olympus.<br />\nCuriously, freshman antipathy<br />\nfor Savitz grew higher as the<br />\nsemester wore on. His PR was<br />\nobviously the culmination of a<br />\nvery complex network of<br />\nfriendships, devotions, contacts.<br />\nBut this was getting damn<br />\nirritating. Our instructions were<br />\nexplicit. They seemed to be saying:<br />\n\"You can never equal him, so<br />\nstand back and admire.\" When in<br />\nhis presence, grovel at his feet.<br />\nGenuflect and kiss his ring. As<br />\nbefits our lower position in life, we<br />\nfreshmen accepted this and<br />\nawaited, not without some awe<br />\nthe beginning of the Council's<br />\nactive functions so that we could,<br />\nperhaps, see some tangible<br />\njustification for this lengthy and<br />\nelaborate preamble.<br />\nYet none was forthcoming.<br />\nNothing tangible. Sure there were<br />\nthe \"well you should have seen this<br />\nplace before Andy...\" explications<br />\nbut these were hardly palatable<br />\nconsolations to people who had<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nUnrestrained<br />\nTo the editor...<br />\nce.2Avcw, \u2022Ocw.

She suggests that<br />\npressure and frustration lead<br />\nHopkins students to commit<br />\nunnamed \"acts of violence and<br />\niminaturity\". She further states<br />\nthat a large number of students<br />\ncannot cope with the \"unusual<br />\npressures\" of Hopkins.<br />\nSuch baseless ranting could be<br />\nunnerving, if taken seriously.<br />\nMiss Seidenfeld furthermore<br />\nsuggests that firm academic<br />\nmotivation, termed as a \"blind<br />\ncompetition to get ahead\" leads to<br />\negocentrism, abandonment of<br />\nfriendship and disregard for fellow<br />\nclassmates.<br />\nIt is obvious that all of these<br />\nobservations are not based on fact.<br />\nI don't recall hearing of anyone<br />\ncommitting assault or rape for the<br />\nhatred of Organic Chemistry.<br />\nHopkins is one of the finer<br />\nuniversities of the nation. From<br />\nmy own experience, I have found<br />\nthat the motivation of (and the<br />\npressure on) the students of M.I.T.,<br />\nCornell, and McGill is very similar.<br />\nI will assume that the situation is<br />\nthe same at other colleges and<br />\nuniversities as well.<br />\nThis observation and the<br />\nobvious evidence that \"better\"<br />\ncolleges have stricter admission<br />\nrequirements lead to a conclusion<br />\nthat cannot help but stare Miss<br />\nSeidenfeld and all of us in the face:<br />\npressure and motivation come<br />\nfrom the students, not the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nOf the thousands of high school<br />\nstudents in the nation, a certain<br />\nportion are going to be competitive<br />\nand motivated, even to . the<br />\nextreme. A re-evaluation of<br />\nadmissions procedures, as she<br />\nsuggests (presumably to lower the<br />\nnumber of pre-meds and pre-laws,<br />\nand hence the competition), would<br />\nonly bring in competitive and<br />\nmotivated students of other<br />\npersuasions. Even if Hopkins was<br />\nable to admit less competitive<br />\nstudents of the same caliber, the<br />\ncompetitive students would have<br />\nto go somewhere else. This<br />\nprocedure would only heighten<br />\ncompetitiveness on the national<br />\nlevel.<br />\nBut even more fundamental<br />\nthan all the above gibberish is the<br />\nfact that a student decides for<br />\nhimself whether or not he is going<br />\nto be a \"throat\". If she is not<br />\n<br />\ninterested in competing for a 4.0<br />\nor discussing Chemistry, she<br />\ndoesn't have to (surely her<br />\ncompetitors will not object).<br />\nNO:way<br />\n<br />\nCcyceMWV1m to wet<br />\nutI s<br />\ntv7T.'7( are ner<br />\n<br />\ngrounds for dissent?<br />\nYou are allowed to get a 2.6<br />\nhere.

There is another minority<br />\n(?) on this campus and on the<br />\nloose in public that has a habit far<br />\nmore dangerous to those in the<br />\nsurrounding environment and<br />\nimmediate living spaces, and that<br />\ngroup is cigarette smokers.<br />\nCigarette smokers generate far<br />\nmore smoke (strong smelling<br />\nsmoke as well) than pot smokers,<br />\nper capita.<br />\nI personally feel that there<br />\nshould be definite, enforceable and<br />\nand enforced rules that would<br />\nprohibit smoking (of all kinds) in<br />\nclasses and in other public places<br />\non campus. For instance, in Shriver<br />\nHall and Schaffer 3 during the<br />\nweekend movie crush - \"Dr.<br />\nZhivago\" in Shaffer 3 on February<br />\n9 - had people crammed into the<br />\naisles and yet there was no attempt<br />\nmade to announce a ban on<br />\nSmolcing (in a situation that was<br />\nalready in violation of the fire<br />\nregulations and highly dangerous in<br />\ncase of fire). There has already<br />\nbeen a start made in allocating<br />\nspaces in the library for smokers<br />\nand non-smokers - perhaps a<br />\nsimilar method could be instigated<br />\nin lecture halls and classrooms, so<br />\nthat those who asphyxiate after 50<br />\nminutes without a cigarette could<br />\nsit down-wind of non-smokers<br />\nwhile in class.<br />\nCommon courtesy has failed as a<br />\nmethod of retaining the viability of<br />\nclassroom atmosphere intact - even<br />\nuncommon courtesy does not<br />\nalways do the job.<br />\nCarol Leininger<br />\n<br />\nEssential<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nnature<br />\n<br />\nof the<br />\n<br />\nrecently<br />\n<br />\no\u2018rganized Hopkins Student<br />\nInformation Group (HSIG),<br />\ncomposed of so-called \"student<br />\nleaders\", As a member of this<br />\norganization, I question both its<br />\nlegitimacy and its utility.<br />\nI doubt this organization's<br />\nlegitimacy on several grounds.<br />\nHSIG is composed of members of<br />\nthe SAC, the Student Council, and<br />\nvarious Student Council<br />\ncommittees. This being the case, it<br />\nappears as if the HSIG is usurping<br />\nthe functions of these<br />\norganizations, particularly the<br />\nSAC. I do not know when the last<br />\ntime an SAC meeting was held.<br />\nSAC meetings should be designed<br />\nto be a forum for discussion by<br />\nHopkins students activities; that is<br />\nthe place where activities should be<br />\nrepresented.

A closer<br />\nrelationship between the SAC and<br />\nthe Student Council would obviate<br />\nthe need for the HSIG.<br />\nIn addition, I question the<br />\nrepresentative nature of the HSIG.<br />\nIt is not representative of the<br />\nstudent body in that very few of<br />\nits members are popularly elected.<br />\nSecondly, the opinions presented<br />\nat these meetings do not represent<br />\npopular opinion, but solely the<br />\nopinions of the participants.<br />\nPerhaps such a group would obtain<br />\nmore accurate opinion of<br />\nundergraduate feelings and concern<br />\nby selecting thirty people at<br />\n<br />\nrandom from the community.<br />\nFinally, the members of this<br />\norganization are reflecting<br />\nundergraduate opinion only when<br />\nac 1,1<br />\n<br />\ntewce<br />\nt7<br />\nthe. s.,Dec..k.<br />\ny, and the fOrum tor Iflis<br />\n<br />\nrepresentation is the SAC, not the<br />\nHSIG.<br />\nIf the SAC were to be more<br />\nactive, then the HSIG would be an<br />\nunnecessary organization in its<br />\npresent character. In fact, the only<br />\nfunction the HSIG serves in my<br />\nmind is to give these \"student<br />\nleaders\" another place to hear<br />\nthemselves talk and complain.<br />\nI must object to HSIG's<br />\nexistence both as a member of this<br />\norganization and as an individual<br />\nstudent. \"Student leader's\" time<br />\ncan be better spent. The<br />\norganization should be dissolved.<br />\nJeff Mirman<br />\nHullabaloo Ed.-in-Chief<br />\nHonor Comm. V. Chairman<br />\n<br />\nThreatening<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nThe Saga Food Service threatens<br />\nto raise food prices this fall; yet, I<br />\nsee no effort on their part to<br />\nreduce the amount of electricity<br />\nbeing utilized to light the<br />\ndormitory dining hall. The<br />\nNewsletter of January 25, 1974<br />\ncites that there may be as much as<br />\na 15 percent rise in dormitory<br />\nroom and board rates this coming<br />\nSeptember. Seeing the enormous<br />\nwaste of electricity occurring<br />\nwithin the cafeteria, I properly<br />\nfilled out a complaint form, and<br />\n<br />\nsubsequently went to deposit this<br />\nslip of paper into the suggestion<br />\nbox--but there was no suggestion<br />\nbox! Thus, the following day,<br />\nt<br />\nth<br />\nurrep<br />\nzsappearance of<br />\nthe suggestion box and the waste<br />\nof power by burning unnecessary<br />\nlights during the brighter parts of<br />\nthe day. I was told that this was a<br />\nvery good, constructive piece of.<br />\ncriticism, and I was appropriately<br />\nthanked for my contribution--and<br />\nthat has been the extent of it.<br />\nWhen and if the room and board<br />\nrates are raised this fall, the<br />\ndormitory students will be directly<br />\naffected by the increased costs,<br />\naccording to the Newsletter of<br />\nJanuary 25, 1974. In the same<br />\narticle, a certain young man of<br />\nhigher authority remarked that he<br />\n\"would hate to think that students<br />\nfeel we're trying to rip them off\";/<br />\nwould consider any type of apathy<br />\nconcerning the saving of energy,<br />\nfollowed by a rise in room and<br />\nboard fees as grounds for<br />\nquestioning the authenticity of<br />\nsuch an increase. The money that<br />\nwould be saved from a reduction in<br />\nthe use of electricity could go to<br />\nthe improvement of the quality of<br />\nthe cafeteria food! Come on, sages<br />\nof Saga!<br />\nThe purpose of this letter, thus,<br />\nis to make students aware of the<br />\nfact that there will be an almost<br />\ncertain room and board increase<br />\nthis fall, yet it appears that very<br />\nlittle action, if any, on the part of<br />\nthe Saga Food Service is being<br />\ntaken to help curtail the<br />\n\"inevitable\" rise in room and<br />\nboard fees.<br />\n<br />\nAndrew W. Savitz<br />\nbeen promised the Messiah. This is<br />\nnot to say that the Council wasn't<br />\nfunctioning fruitfully; the problem<br />\nlies, I believe, in the fact that the<br />\ncouncil has become very elaborate,<br />\ncircuitous - network of<br />\ncommittees, resulting in delegation<br />\nof responsibility, results<br />\nin<br />\ndelayed output. The average<br />\nfreshman has a vision of a<br />\nserpentine system of personal<br />\nliaisons, subcommittees, and<br />\nunnecessary preoccupation with<br />\nthe administrative, with the<br />\nminiscule. The facade is falling<br />\nfast. Tragedy on Olympus.'<br />\nAfter our acquaintance with<br />\nSavitz, we were slowly introduced<br />\nto the remainder of the hierarchy,<br />\nmost particularly Vice President<br />\nJohn Colmers. They appeared as<br />\nlackeys, coolies; followers riding<br />\non the coattails of this aggressive<br />\nstudent defender. It seems they<br />\nwill receive a large portion of the<br />\nblame for this aforesaid<br />\ndisappointment for they were the<br />\nmajor exponenets of the Savitz PR.<br />\nAnd their sin is all the more<br />\ngrievous since they fostered these<br />\nexpectations.

Decadence on<br />\n<br />\nthat he will be elected Senior Class<br />\npresident and that the new Council<br />\npresident will want him acting as<br />\nan advisor. Complacency on<br />\nOlympus.<br />\nShortly after this article was<br />\nrun, rumors began to drift down to<br />\nme in my staff position about a<br />\nconflict of interest regarding<br />\nSavitz. Savtiz, it seemed, submitted<br />\na Symposium topic yet Savitz<br />\nscreens all submissions and is on<br />\nthe Selections Committee. Indeed<br />\na conflict. Savitz playing both<br />\nhands of the poker game. Savitz<br />\nplaying Howard Hughes the major<br />\nstockholder in a company being<br />\nsued by the company. Scandal on<br />\nOlympus.<br />\nNo sooner was the uproar<br />\ncommended than it was laid to rest<br />\nby an elaborate administrative<br />\nretraction. No, Andrew has<br />\nwithdrawn his topic. Andrew was<br />\nnaughty but is now forgiven.<br />\nHumility on Olympus.<br />\nSoon afterwards, rumors began<br />\nto circulate to the effect that John<br />\nColmers was being groomed for the<br />\njob of ombudsmen set up as Shep<br />\nHoffman's successor.

There is no doubt<br />\nthat the Blue Jay mermen have<br />\nprofited greatly from the tutelage<br />\nof Head Coach Frank Comfort,<br />\nDiving Coach Vic Corbin and<br />\nAssistant Swimming Coach Josh<br />\nTreem. They deserve much of the<br />\ncredit for their contributions in<br />\nmaking the Hopkins pool<br />\nprogram one of the best in the<br />\nnation.<br />\nCoach Comfort originally hails<br />\nfrom Harrisburg, Pa. He started<br />\nswimming on a YMCA team in<br />\neighth grade and took to<br />\nswimming like a duck takes to<br />\nwater. He had already decided<br />\nthat he wanted to be a swimming<br />\ncoach by the time he was in<br />\ntenth grade. He went on to<br />\nSyracuse University where he<br />\nswam on one of the better teams<br />\nin the East. In his career as an<br />\nOrangeman, Comfort primarily<br />\nswam the distance freestyle and<br />\nbutterfly. When asked about his<br />\ntimes in comparison to those of<br />\n<br />\nSwimming Coach, Frank Comfort<br />\nhis swimmers, he said, \"I could<br />\nhave beaten them all!!\" He<br />\ngraduated from Syracuse in 1967<br />\nafter completing 5 years of work<br />\nin 4, with degrees in social<br />\nstudies and physical education.<br />\nAfter coaching in the summer<br />\n(as has always been his practice),<br />\nComfort moved down to the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina<br />\nwhere he planned on doing<br />\ngraduate work and possibly<br />\nworking with the swimmers<br />\nthere, who were perennial<br />\nEastern powers. To his surprise,<br />\nhe was appointed coach of the<br />\nfreshman swim team by the head<br />\ncoach who obviously knew<br />\ncoaching talent when he saw it.<br />\n\"It was the best crop of<br />\nswimmers I'd ever seen,\" said<br />\n<br />\nchampionships the past 3 years<br />\nwith high hopes. for national<br />\nhonors this year as well.<br />\n\u2022 However, there is much more<br />\nto a successful swimming<br />\nprogram than just an excellent<br />\nhead coach.

In the<br />\nspring of 1968, Assositant Coach<br />\nComfort heard about the opening<br />\nhere at Homewood. When asked<br />\nabout his initial reaction,<br />\nComfort replied, \"I really wasn't<br />\nthrilled about it\" which is logical<br />\nconsidering the Blue Jay mermen<br />\nhad been mediocre at best in the<br />\nprior few seasons. However, after<br />\nvisiting Hopkins, viewing the<br />\nfacilities, and speaking to<br />\nMarshall Turner and other<br />\nmembers of the staff, Assistant<br />\nCoach Comfort became Head<br />\nCoach Comfort and the<br />\nComforteers were born.<br />\n\u2022 Blue Jay swimming began with<br />\na splash and took off from there.<br />\nIn his first season as coach the<br />\nJays won the conference and<br />\nhighlighted the season with an<br />\nupset win over the University of<br />\nDelaware. The rest is history and<br />\nincludes 9th, 6th and 3rd place<br />\nfinishes in the NCAA<br />\n<br />\nJosh Treem is a 1969 graduate of<br />\nHopkins. In his senior year he<br />\nwas a member of Coach<br />\nComfort's first varsity team and<br />\nMAC champions. Even though<br />\nthis is his first year on the staff<br />\nJosh brings a great deal of<br />\ncoaching experience, including a<br />\nyear at Duke, and maturity to<br />\nthe Blue Jay staff. Despite his<br />\nwork in the U. S.

The<br />\ntremendous improvement of<br />\nHopkins divers over the years.<br />\nand especially this year in which<br />\nMarc Tohir has qualified for<br />\nnationals, are testament to his<br />\ngreat coaching ability.

That was high<br />\nschool stuff. But here I was in<br />\ncollege and not only was I seeing it<br />\nbut I was having it shouted in my<br />\nears throughout my first weeks<br />\nhere. In short, I was depressed, for<br />\nI felt sure that those notions of<br />\ncongenital superiority had been<br />\nleft behind along with high school<br />\nprincipals and detention.<br />\nMeeting Savitz wasn't as<br />\ntranscendental an experience as I<br />\nhad anticipated. I spoke to him for<br />\nthe first time when he strolled into<br />\nthe News-Letter office, sometime<br />\nin mid-September. He was very<br />\ninformal, very willing to talk, in<br />\nsome respects a journalist's dream a fellow in a position of authority<br />\nwho actually liked to sit down and<br />\ntalk, who liked to wax polemic. He<br />\nenjoyed speaking perhaps because<br />\nthe topic was usually himself, and<br />\nhe did so effervescently, bubbling<br />\nforth with congested prose which<br />\nwas plainly contrived yet<br /><br />\npleasantly vernacular; and it was<br />\nappropriate, for Savitz addresses<br />\nhimself to a popular, sometimes<br />\nuncultured, and philistine<br />\naudience.<br />\nIt's Customary, bordering on<br />\nprerequisite, for politicians to have<br />\nhigh self-esteem quotients, but this<br />\nman was impudent. After hearing<br />\nhim speak for thirty minutes I<br />\nrealized that he does so in an<br />\noverbearing voice, even his<br />\nconversational tone is of<br />\nexceptionally loud volume. He<br />\nstrutted around a great deal,<br />\nhitting things, laughing raucously,<br />\nand out of context, enacting<br />\nhumorous conceits to get<br />\nattention. Strange. Piaget's theory<br />\nof the overcompensative psyche.<br />\nInsecurity on Olympus.<br />\nCuriously, freshman antipathy<br />\nfor Savitz grew higher as the<br />\nsemester wore on. His PR was<br />\nobviously the culmination of a<br />\nvery complex network of<br />\nfriendships, devotions, contacts.<br />\nBut this was getting damn<br />\nirritating. Our instructions were<br />\nexplicit. They seemed to be saying:<br />\n\"You can never equal him, so<br />\nstand back and admire.\" When in<br />\nhis presence, grovel at his feet.<br />\nGenuflect and kiss his ring. As<br />\nbefits our lower position in life, we<br />\nfreshmen accepted this and<br />\nawaited, not without some awe<br />\nthe beginning of the Council's<br />\nactive functions so that we could,<br />\nperhaps, see some tangible<br />\njustification for this lengthy and<br />\nelaborate preamble.<br />\nYet none was forthcoming.<br />\nNothing tangible. Sure there were<br />\nthe \"well you should have seen this<br />\nplace before Andy...\" explications<br />\nbut these were hardly palatable<br />\nconsolations to people who had<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nUnrestrained<br />\nTo the editor...<br />\nce.2Avcw, \u2022Ocw.

She suggests that<br />\npressure and frustration lead<br />\nHopkins students to commit<br />\nunnamed \"acts of violence and<br />\niminaturity\". She further states<br />\nthat a large number of students<br />\ncannot cope with the \"unusual<br />\npressures\" of Hopkins.<br />\nSuch baseless ranting could be<br />\nunnerving, if taken seriously.<br />\nMiss Seidenfeld furthermore<br />\nsuggests that firm academic<br />\nmotivation, termed as a \"blind<br />\ncompetition to get ahead\" leads to<br />\negocentrism, abandonment of<br />\nfriendship and disregard for fellow<br />\nclassmates.<br />\nIt is obvious that all of these<br />\nobservations are not based on fact.<br />\nI don't recall hearing of anyone<br />\ncommitting assault or rape for the<br />\nhatred of Organic Chemistry.<br />\nHopkins is one of the finer<br />\nuniversities of the nation. From<br />\nmy own experience, I have found<br />\nthat the motivation of (and the<br />\npressure on) the students of M.I.T.,<br />\nCornell, and McGill is very similar.<br />\nI will assume that the situation is<br />\nthe same at other colleges and<br />\nuniversities as well.<br />\nThis observation and the<br />\nobvious evidence that \"better\"<br />\ncolleges have stricter admission<br />\nrequirements lead to a conclusion<br />\nthat cannot help but stare Miss<br />\nSeidenfeld and all of us in the face:<br />\npressure and motivation come<br />\nfrom the students, not the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nOf the thousands of high school<br />\nstudents in the nation, a certain<br />\nportion are going to be competitive<br />\nand motivated, even to . the<br />\nextreme. A re-evaluation of<br />\nadmissions procedures, as she<br />\nsuggests (presumably to lower the<br />\nnumber of pre-meds and pre-laws,<br />\nand hence the competition), would<br />\nonly bring in competitive and<br />\nmotivated students of other<br />\npersuasions. Even if Hopkins was<br />\nable to admit less competitive<br />\nstudents of the same caliber, the<br />\ncompetitive students would have<br />\nto go somewhere else. This<br />\nprocedure would only heighten<br />\ncompetitiveness on the national<br />\nlevel.<br />\nBut even more fundamental<br />\nthan all the above gibberish is the<br />\nfact that a student decides for<br />\nhimself whether or not he is going<br />\nto be a \"throat\". If she is not<br /><br />\ninterested in competing for a 4.0<br />\nor discussing Chemistry, she<br />\ndoesn't have to (surely her<br />\ncompetitors will not object).<br />\nNO:way<br /><br />\nCcyceMWV1m to wet<br />\nutI s<br />\ntv7T.'7( are ner<br /><br />\ngrounds for dissent?<br />\nYou are allowed to get a 2.6<br />\nhere.

There is another minority<br />\n(?) on this campus and on the<br />\nloose in public that has a habit far<br />\nmore dangerous to those in the<br />\nsurrounding environment and<br />\nimmediate living spaces, and that<br />\ngroup is cigarette smokers.<br />\nCigarette smokers generate far<br />\nmore smoke (strong smelling<br />\nsmoke as well) than pot smokers,<br />\nper capita.<br />\nI personally feel that there<br />\nshould be definite, enforceable and<br />\nand enforced rules that would<br />\nprohibit smoking (of all kinds) in<br />\nclasses and in other public places<br />\non campus. For instance, in Shriver<br />\nHall and Schaffer 3 during the<br />\nweekend movie crush - \"Dr.<br />\nZhivago\" in Shaffer 3 on February<br />\n9 - had people crammed into the<br />\naisles and yet there was no attempt<br />\nmade to announce a ban on<br />\nSmolcing (in a situation that was<br />\nalready in violation of the fire<br />\nregulations and highly dangerous in<br />\ncase of fire). There has already<br />\nbeen a start made in allocating<br />\nspaces in the library for smokers<br />\nand non-smokers - perhaps a<br />\nsimilar method could be instigated<br />\nin lecture halls and classrooms, so<br />\nthat those who asphyxiate after 50<br />\nminutes without a cigarette could<br />\nsit down-wind of non-smokers<br />\nwhile in class.<br />\nCommon courtesy has failed as a<br />\nmethod of retaining the viability of<br />\nclassroom atmosphere intact - even<br />\nuncommon courtesy does not<br />\nalways do the job.<br />\nCarol Leininger<br /><br />\nEssential<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nthe<br /><br />\nnature<br /><br />\nof the<br /><br />\nrecently<br /><br />\no\u2018rganized Hopkins Student<br />\nInformation Group (HSIG),<br />\ncomposed of so-called \"student<br />\nleaders\", As a member of this<br />\norganization, I question both its<br />\nlegitimacy and its utility.<br />\nI doubt this organization's<br />\nlegitimacy on several grounds.<br />\nHSIG is composed of members of<br />\nthe SAC, the Student Council, and<br />\nvarious Student Council<br />\ncommittees. This being the case, it<br />\nappears as if the HSIG is usurping<br />\nthe functions of these<br />\norganizations, particularly the<br />\nSAC. I do not know when the last<br />\ntime an SAC meeting was held.<br />\nSAC meetings should be designed<br />\nto be a forum for discussion by<br />\nHopkins students activities; that is<br />\nthe place where activities should be<br />\nrepresented. Furthermore, if the<br />\nSAC wishes to suggest proposals<br />\nfor change, it should present them<br />\nto the Student Council.

The<br />\nNewsletter of January 25, 1974<br />\ncites that there may be as much as<br />\na 15 percent rise in dormitory<br />\nroom and board rates this coming<br />\nSeptember. Seeing the enormous<br />\nwaste of electricity occurring<br />\nwithin the cafeteria, I properly<br />\nfilled out a complaint form, and<br /><br />\nsubsequently went to deposit this<br />\nslip of paper into the suggestion<br />\nbox--but there was no suggestion<br />\nbox! Thus, the following day,<br />\nt<br />\nth<br />\nurrep<br />\nzsappearance of<br />\nthe suggestion box and the waste<br />\nof power by burning unnecessary<br />\nlights during the brighter parts of<br />\nthe day. I was told that this was a<br />\nvery good, constructive piece of.<br />\ncriticism, and I was appropriately<br />\nthanked for my contribution--and<br />\nthat has been the extent of it.<br />\nWhen and if the room and board<br />\nrates are raised this fall, the<br />\ndormitory students will be directly<br />\naffected by the increased costs,<br />\naccording to the Newsletter of<br />\nJanuary 25, 1974. In the same<br />\narticle, a certain young man of<br />\nhigher authority remarked that he<br />\n\"would hate to think that students<br />\nfeel we're trying to rip them off\";/<br />\nwould consider any type of apathy<br />\nconcerning the saving of energy,<br />\nfollowed by a rise in room and<br />\nboard fees as grounds for<br />\nquestioning the authenticity of<br />\nsuch an increase.

Savitz<br />\nbeen promised the Messiah. This is<br />\nnot to say that the Council wasn't<br />\nfunctioning fruitfully; the problem<br />\nlies, I believe, in the fact that the<br />\ncouncil has become very elaborate,<br />\ncircuitous - network of<br />\ncommittees, resulting in delegation<br />\nof responsibility, results<br />\nin<br />\ndelayed output. The average<br />\nfreshman has a vision of a<br />\nserpentine system of personal<br />\nliaisons, subcommittees, and<br />\nunnecessary preoccupation with<br />\nthe administrative, with the<br />\nminiscule. The facade is falling<br />\nfast. Tragedy on Olympus.'<br />\nAfter our acquaintance with<br />\nSavitz, we were slowly introduced<br />\nto the remainder of the hierarchy,<br />\nmost particularly Vice President<br />\nJohn Colmers. They appeared as<br />\nlackeys, coolies; followers riding<br />\non the coattails of this aggressive<br />\nstudent defender. It seems they<br />\nwill receive a large portion of the<br />\nblame for this aforesaid<br />\ndisappointment for they were the<br />\nmajor exponenets of the Savitz PR.<br />\nAnd their sin is all the more<br />\ngrievous since they fostered these<br />\nexpectations.

Decadence on<br /><br />\nthat he will be elected Senior Class<br />\npresident and that the new Council<br />\npresident will want him acting as<br />\nan advisor. Complacency on<br />\nOlympus.<br />\nShortly after this article was<br />\nrun, rumors began to drift down to<br />\nme in my staff position about a<br />\nconflict of interest regarding<br />\nSavitz. Savtiz, it seemed, submitted<br />\na Symposium topic yet Savitz<br />\nscreens all submissions and is on<br />\nthe Selections Committee. Indeed<br />\na conflict. Savitz playing both<br />\nhands of the poker game. Savitz<br />\nplaying Howard Hughes the major<br />\nstockholder in a company being<br />\nsued by the company. Scandal on<br />\nOlympus.<br />\nNo sooner was the uproar<br />\ncommended than it was laid to rest<br />\nby an elaborate administrative<br />\nretraction. No, Andrew has<br />\nwithdrawn his topic. Andrew was<br />\nnaughty but is now forgiven.<br />\nHumility on Olympus.<br />\nSoon afterwards, rumors began<br />\nto circulate to the effect that John<br />\nColmers was being groomed for the<br />\njob of ombudsmen set up as Shep<br />\nHoffman's successor.

There is no doubt<br />\nthat the Blue Jay mermen have<br />\nprofited greatly from the tutelage<br />\nof Head Coach Frank Comfort,<br />\nDiving Coach Vic Corbin and<br />\nAssistant Swimming Coach Josh<br />\nTreem. They deserve much of the<br />\ncredit for their contributions in<br />\nmaking the Hopkins pool<br />\nprogram one of the best in the<br />\nnation.<br />\nCoach Comfort originally hails<br />\nfrom Harrisburg, Pa. He started<br />\nswimming on a YMCA team in<br />\neighth grade and took to<br />\nswimming like a duck takes to<br />\nwater. He had already decided<br />\nthat he wanted to be a swimming<br />\ncoach by the time he was in<br />\ntenth grade. He went on to<br />\nSyracuse University where he<br />\nswam on one of the better teams<br />\nin the East. In his career as an<br />\nOrangeman, Comfort primarily<br />\nswam the distance freestyle and<br />\nbutterfly. When asked about his<br />\ntimes in comparison to those of<br /><br />\nSwimming Coach, Frank Comfort<br />\nhis swimmers, he said, \"I could<br />\nhave beaten them all!!\" He<br />\ngraduated from Syracuse in 1967<br />\nafter completing 5 years of work<br />\nin 4, with degrees in social<br />\nstudies and physical education.<br />\nAfter coaching in the summer<br />\n(as has always been his practice),<br />\nComfort moved down to the<br /><br />\nUniversity of North Carolina<br />\nwhere he planned on doing<br />\ngraduate work and possibly<br />\nworking with the swimmers<br />\nthere, who were perennial<br />\nEastern powers. To his surprise,<br />\nhe was appointed coach of the<br />\nfreshman swim team by the head<br />\ncoach who obviously knew<br />\ncoaching talent when he saw it.<br />\n\"It was the best crop of<br />\nswimmers I'd ever seen,\" said<br /><br />\nchampionships the past 3 years<br />\nwith high hopes. for national<br />\nhonors this year as well.<br />\n\u2022 However, there is much more<br />\nto a successful swimming<br />\nprogram than just an excellent<br />\nhead coach.

In the<br />\nspring of 1968, Assositant Coach<br />\nComfort heard about the opening<br />\nhere at Homewood. When asked<br />\nabout his initial reaction,<br />\nComfort replied, \"I really wasn't<br />\nthrilled about it\" which is logical<br />\nconsidering the Blue Jay mermen<br />\nhad been mediocre at best in the<br />\nprior few seasons. However, after<br />\nvisiting Hopkins, viewing the<br />\nfacilities, and speaking to<br />\nMarshall Turner and other<br />\nmembers of the staff, Assistant<br />\nCoach Comfort became Head<br />\nCoach Comfort and the<br />\nComforteers were born.<br />\n\u2022 Blue Jay swimming began with<br />\na splash and took off from there.<br />\nIn his first season as coach the<br />\nJays won the conference and<br />\nhighlighted the season with an<br />\nupset win over the University of<br />\nDelaware.

In his senior year he<br />\nwas a member of Coach<br />\nComfort's first varsity team and<br />\nMAC champions.
