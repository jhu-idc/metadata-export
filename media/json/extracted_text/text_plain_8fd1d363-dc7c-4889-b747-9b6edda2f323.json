AND ONE FOR MY FRIEND, HERE!'<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editors<br />\nDebate Council<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nJournalistic deadlines frequently make<br />\nhasty investigation of facts and issues a<br />\nnecessity for anyone who expects to see<br />\nhis story go to press. The News-Letter<br />\nunfortunately faces these same pressures,<br />\nwhich torment all of America's<br />\nmultimedia endeavors. When such<br />\nconsiderations occasionally produce an<br />\ninflammatory and jaundiced article, it<br />\nthen becomes the chore of the offended<br />\nparty to offer a belated second side to the<br />\nissue and hope that the damage is not<br />\nirreparable. It is thus that I take quill in<br />\nhand to defend my slandered<br />\norganization, the Johns Hopkins Debate<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nI must first point out that the author<br />\nof Friday's article, entitled (for the sheer<br />\nenjoyment of any posthumous admirers<br />\nof William Randolph Hearst) \"Debate<br />\nCouncil ,Fails To Show Just Cause,\"<br />\nconducted an \"interview\" which<br />\nconsisted of asking me a few innocuous<br />\nquestions while I was eating a tuna fish<br />\nsandwich one day last week in Levering<br />\nHall. Only when I received a follow-up<br />\nphone call on Thursday evening (when,<br />\naccording to the author nearly the entire<br />\narticle had already been written), did l<br />\n/17terviewe<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\na-<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\ne mem er ,cthe<br />\n<br />\nignoring<br />\nNews-Letter staff. By effectively<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nvirtually all of the limited information he<br />\nbothered to request of me, he was able to<br />\ncreate a-ve-rY one-sided \"controversy\" for<br />\nFriday's edition. Nevertheless, the story<br />\naddressed itself to several aspects of the<br />\nDebate Council's operations which<br />\ndeserve comment.<br />\nFirst, there has been some question as<br />\nto who benefits by the debate program.<br />\nThe most obvious response is: The<br />\nDebate Council members themselves. Not<br />\nonly does debating constitute refinement<br />\nof forensic qualities and an active<br />\ninvolvement in scholarly research, but it<br />\nis a crucial preparation for many students<br />\nwho intend to pursue graduate studies,<br />\nparticularly in law schools. Debating has<br />\nconsistently proven to be one of the most<br />\nvaluable extracurriculars that a student<br />\ncan be involved in.<br />\nSecond, it has been pointed out that<br />\nthe size of the budget relative to the<br />\nnumber of members\u2014or the per-person<br />\ncost\u2014is probably higher than many other<br />\nstudent activities. This truism must be<br />\nconsidered in light of the fact that it is<br />\nthe only organization that engages in<br />\nintercollegiate competition and is one of<br />\nthe 2 activities that does any travelling.<br />\n<br />\nThese items comprise most of our yearly<br />\nexpenditure. The amount we receive,<br />\nhowever, is drastically lower than the<br />\nbudgets provided by the schools against<br />\nwhich we compete and compares<br />\nfavorably with Hopkins other competitive<br />\nefforts (i.e. the Athletic Programs).<br />\nA third issue that people have<br />\ndiscussed with me is the number of<br />\nmenii)ers in the activity. This is an<br />\nimportant consideration because if the<br />\nCouncil's membership were to drop<br />\nsharply in the future, it would probably<br />\nbe politically more expedient to have a<br />\ncommensurate reduction in the Debate<br />\nCouncil's budget than to upgrade the<br />\nscope and quality of the Council's<br />\nactivities. As a result, this year's officers<br />\nhave engaged in a more extensive<br />\nrecruiting effort directed at the freshman<br />\nclass than ever before. The very<br />\nencouraging result is that this year's<br />\nDebate Council has a MAJORITY of<br />\nfreshmen and novices in its ranks. By<br />\ncontinuing this effort next fall, the<br />\n1973-74 Debate Council will become one<br />\nof the largest such organizations on the<br />\nEast Coast. The Student Council and<br />\nStudent Activites Commission have been<br />\nenthusiastic supporters of this enrollment<br />\neffort.<br />\nQuestion number 4 has frequently<br />\n\u2022e.a e<br />\n<br />\n))<br />\n<br />\nIn which Ms. Toth views three feministfilms<br />\nBy EMILY TOTH<br />\nWhat is female culture?

Hands change diapers,<br />\nmake sandwiches, sweep floors. Only the<br />\nhands are shown: the women are<br />\ninvisible. The work is the work done by<br />\nall those in the female condition.<br />\nNumerous women talk about their<br />\nunhappy marriagies. They were<br />\ncon ditoned to think of marriage as<br />\n\"undying, love:' They<br />\n<br />\nbelieved they<br />\n<br />\nwomen<br />\n<br />\nfind this<br />\n<br />\nboylowed<br />\n<br />\nidentity<br />\n<br />\nincluded me.\" In New York, she had to<br />\nlearn how to shop, how to cross busy<br />\nstreets, how to let the water out of hotel<br />\nbathtubs.<br />\nBut she also turned a hobby into<br />\nproductive work: she became an artist.<br />\nVery few women artists have happy<br />\nmarriages, she points out. As a housewife,<br />\nher life was regulated by chores done for<br />\nothers; now, as an artist, she disciplines<br />\nher life herself, for her own work.<br />\nMay Wilson's art is eccentric: portraits<br />\nand junk assemblage. There are portraits<br />\nof her head, on the bodies ofjockeys and<br />\ncoal miners and Whistler's mother;<br />\nmontages of herself picking her nose, in<br />\nthe style of 25-cent-picture booth<br />\nportraits; old high heels and baby dolls,<br />\nsprayed in bright colors and placed in odd<br />\njuxtapositions.<br />\nFemale culture would certainly include<br />\nthis \"Grandma Moses of the<br />\nUnderground\", who is portrayed entirely<br />\nin her own words. But art is a very rare<br />\nescape for a woman. More commonly, as<br />\nin \"The Women's Film,\" she is limited by<br />\neconomics or social conditioning\u2014or, as<br />\nin \"It Happens to Us,\" by her biology. . .<br />\nThis third film is about abortion. One<br />\nwoman tells of her illegal coathanger<br />\nabortion, while her father stood over her<br />\n<br />\nwoman's abortion\u2014and the man answers<br />\nall the questions. He's always feared<br />\npregnancy, he says; especially now, while<br />\nhe's still in school. The abortion made<br />\nhim less fearful, and was good for his<br />\nfeelings about sex. His roomate, the<br />\nabortionee, miles silently while he '<br />\ndefines her life.<br />\n\"It Happens to Us\" is an informative<br />\nfilm: it contains interviews, statistics, and<br />\ndescriptions of types of abortion. But it<br />\ndeals only with women's control over<br />\ntheir bodies, and suggests that (in at least<br />\none case) even abortion is taken over as<br />\npart of the man's life-experience.<br />\nAll three films show some women<br />\ntrying to define themselves, rather than<br />\naccepting society's or men's definitions.<br />\nWe see the women through women.\u2022<br />\ndirectors' eyes: until recently, this view<br />\nwas rarely possible. The Rothschild films<br />\nare made for New Day Films, formed last<br />\nyear by Rothschild and two other women<br />\nto make and distribute films more<br />\ncheaply than standard corporations<br />\npermit. Collectives like New Day allow<br />\nwomen filmmakers more artistic and<br />\nfinancial freedom in portraying a female<br />\nculture.<br />\nThe portraits in these films are made<br />\nthrough talking--more characteristic of<br />\n<br />\nand berated her for havin<br />\n<br />\nwomen's worl<br />\n<br />\nsex out of<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\nanswer is EVERY type of forensic<br />\nfunction that its members are interested<br />\nin during any given year.

In addition we sponsor a<br />\nmajor intercollegiate debate tournament<br />\nin the fall and a high school tournament<br />\nduring the spring semester.<br />\nIt is extremely important for a Student<br />\nCouncil to assure itself and its<br />\nconstituency that whatever money it<br />\nallocates is going to worthwhile<br />\nendeavors. One of the responsibilities of<br />\nany organization head is to explain the<br />\nfunctions and breadth of activities that its<br />\nlevel of funding allows. It would, of<br />\ncourse, be helpful if an organization were<br />\nasked to defend itself BEFORE someone<br />\ntries to conclude that it \"fails to show<br />\nJust cause\". With respect to debating at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, I can only claim that the<br />\ncause is indeed just and hope that this<br />\nephemeral controversy will return to its<br />\njust obscurity.<br />\n<br />\nEd Stehlik<br />\nPresident, Debate Council<br />\n<br />\nbitterly, that she wanted to<br />\n<br />\nmarry so she could spend her time eating<br />\ncandy bars and drinking Pepsi Cola. But<br />\nher marriage was so bad that she \"forgot<br />\nabout the Pepsi Cola.\" For lack of<br />\nalternatives, another woman spent sixteen<br />\n<br />\nlaughing<br />\n<br />\ninto the ATO house on North Calvert. We<br />\nwere struck with horror to see every<br />\nyoung man wearing a jacket and tie, and<br />\nevery young woman wearing a dress. This<br />\nwas a pledge party, a rite de passage,<br />\nsomething to make the initiate feel like a<br />\nBrother. We felt out of place and left.<br />\nThe Delta Phi party seemed more<br />\nleisurely, in contrast \u2014 possibly because<br />\nthe frat boys there have given up<br />\nnormally feeble attempts to justify their<br />\ncorporate existence and, decked with all<br />\nthe frills of fraternity life, including the<br />\nubiquitous annual membership photos,<br />\nhave come to see themselves as instances<br />\nof societal decline.<br />\nSo, noting color prints throughout the<br />\nhouse, a fire in the quasi-Georgian living<br />\nroom fireplace, occasional oriental rugs<br />\non the floor, a four-volume American<br />\n(Houghton-Mifflin) edition of Bleak<br />\nHouse (1863) and a Harvard Alumni<br />\nDirectory (1960), we made our way<br />\ndownstairs in search of dancing. space<br />\nand a couple beers.<br />\nWe found more than we had expected.<br />\nFor a chapter almost constantly rumored<br />\nto be on the skids, the Delta Phi boys<br />\naren't doing too bad, thank you.<br />\nThe place was packed.

There's nothing wrong with saving<br />\n$1350, and the car it helped pay for<br />\nwould not look as good with anyone else<br />\nin the driver's seat.<br />\nBut aside from the financial savings<br />\nand whatever feeling of satisfaction there<br />\nmight be from having finally completed<br />\nsomething ahead of time, it is a pretty<br />\nunsettling feeling. For when you come<br />\nright down to it, what is education if not<br />\n<br />\nMore than we expected was there<br />\nBy B. H. COHEN<br />\nIt's been a long time since I've seen so<br />\nmany people having such a good time.<br />\nAbsurdity of pretentiousness aside,<br />\nfraternity living, or if you prefer,<br />\nparty-crashing, certainly has its<br />\nadvantages.<br />\nTake last Saturday's party at Delta<br />\nPhi's expansive spread on Chauncery<br />\nRoad. The Delta Phi's, you may recall,<br />\nwere featured in a special September<br />\nEsquire spread on American college<br />\nyouth, wherin the point was made that<br />\nour frat boys are trendy followers of the<br />\ninternational jet set, with a five year lag<br />\nthrown in for good measure.<br />\nIt wasn't a bad party, as rush parties<br />\ngo. We arrived at 9:30, to find mearly a<br />\nhundred souls, listening to the band,<br />\nvariously known as the \"Homewood<br />\nDead\" or the \"Woodstock Nation, 1972.\"<br />\nThe frat boys used to have a rule about<br />\nlot being able to hire bands for their rush<br />\n)arties, even if the members were all<br />\nFloppies, but like most other rules, it's<br />\nflexible.<br />\nDress .at frat parties is apt to range<br />\nfrom backless evening gowns with the<br />\nfront slit to the waist, to sweaters and<br />\njeans. Some frat boys wear jackets.<br />\n* * *<br />\nLast year, for example, we wanaereu<br />\n<br />\nyears married to a man who tied a string<br />\nacross the front door to know if she'd<br />\nbeen out in his absence.<br />\nOther common themes are fear and<br />\nconfinement. Chicanos fear \"gringos.\"<br />\nSecretaries are confined to the typewriter<br />\nand function as office housewives:<br />\nhanging up coats, making coffee.<br />\nTelephone operators fear taking too long<br />\nin the bathroom and losing their jobs.<br />\nWelfare mothers are confined to celibacy<br />\nif they want to continue receiving their<br />\nchecks. All are forced into passive roles.<br />\nInterviews with women are intercut<br />\nwith still photographs and voice-overs.<br />\nAfter a Black woman says \"the<br />\noccupations of Black men and women are<br />\nset at birth,\" stills of slave auctions<br />\nappear, with an auctioneer's voice<br />\nextolling the qualities of a female slave:<br />\n\"fine body... fit for breeding....\"<br />\nThe film begins with individual<br />\nwomen, but moves to a critique of<br />\nsociety. Says one middle-class woman,<br />\n\"We think the problem is the individual's,<br />\nbut we've all defined ourselves in terms of<br />\nmen.\" There is a female culture in that all<br />\nwomen are conditioned to expect<br />\nhappiness through relationship to men:<br />\none woman takes her husband's place on<br />\na picket line when he is arrested. Most<br />\n<br />\nmanaged to serve some mighty fine brew<br />\n(Dortmunder).<br />\nTechnique has always meant something<br />\nspecial to the frat boys. Behind the<br />\nten-foot long bar, there are three Brothers<br />\nrunning around. We had to wait ten<br />\nminutes to be served. One freshman notes<br />\ntoo much foam in his beer, and asks the<br />\ntall, mechanical bartender to put his<br />\nfingers over the spout.<br />\n\"This is the way we do it here,\" the<br />\nBrother remarks. His voice carried a sense<br />\nof conviction.<br />\nTen minutes later, another Brother,<br />\nthis one a member of the fencing team, is<br />\nserving. He fingers never leave the spout.<br />\nThere is no more foam. There will always<br />\nbe dissention in the ranks.<br />\n* * *<br />\nConsider the following line:<br />\n\"Hi, my name is Martin. Are you from<br />\nHopkins or from Goucher?\" Breaking the<br />\nice has always been a problem. One<br />\nsupposes that there will always be lonely<br />\npeople, waiting to meet other lonely<br />\npeople. In an atmosphere of pressure and<br />\ndistrust, one may assume that the<br />\nfraternities will survive, as islands of<br />\nconsolation in a tired world.<br />\nWe left with a slight headache, to work<br />\nthe graveyard shift at the Hopkins<br />\nswitchboard.<br />\n<br />\na massive security blanket which serves to<br />\npostpone the day when you filially have<br />\nto confront the real world.<br />\nReality is a tight job market. Reality is<br />\ngetting letters from Mom with no checks<br />\nenclosed. Reality is having to wear a coat<br />\nand tie, instead of dungarees, being called<br />\nMr. Cantor, and not Joe, and having to<br />\nconsult H. & R. Block before filling out<br />\ntax returns, instead of just assuming there<br />\nwill be a refund check forthcoming.<br />\nSecurity, on the other hand, is going to<br />\nschool for as long as you want, either to<br />\nbroaden your horizons or to increase the<br />\npossibility of eventually landing a job.<br />\n(We all know how easy it is to find work<br />\nwith an M.A. or Ph.D.) Security is having<br />\nas long as you want to turn in a paper,<br />\nwatching deadline give way to deadline,<br />\nto incomplete, back to deadline.<br />\nSecurity is being able to go through an<br />\nentire day, the only constructive<br />\naccomplishments having been to prepare<br />\ndinner and read the New York _Times.<br />\nSecurity is flaying all the time in the<br />\nworld to discuss politics and The New<br />\nMorality, and not have to worry about<br />\n<br />\ncatcning a train or a bus.<br />\nIf this isn't security, why then is there<br />\nsuch competition to get into colleges,<br />\ngraduate schools, and professional<br />\nschools? Acceptance at one of these<br />\ninstitutions buys a person three or four or<br />\nfive more years before having to face up<br />\n<br />\nto the next big step. And what about<br />\nthose poor, insecure souls who can never<br />\nbear to get off the ladder and wind up as<br />\nfull professors?<br />\nI don't want to cast aspersions on<br />\nthose who really did come for an<br />\neducation (even I have learned a few<br />\n.things here, academically speaking). I just<br />\nwant to point out what a strange thing<br />\nsecurity is and how it can lead to all sorts<br />\nof self-deceptions and illusions.<br />\nFor instance, I came to Hopkins not<br />\nhaving relinquished my ten year dream of<br />\nbecoming President. By the middle of<br />\nfreshman year, it was to be a big-time<br />\njournalist with the option of running for<br />\nthe Senate from there. Sophomore year<br />\nfound me dreaming of being a competent<br />\nreporter for a newspaper. With only two<br />\nyears to go before having to choose, I<br />\nlowered it to an obscure politico working<br />\nfor someone I admired. And with one<br />\nyear left, I gave serious thought to<br />\nteaching high school. From the White<br />\nHouse to the school house in just three<br />\nyears; what a meteoric decline in<br />\nexpectations!<br />\nAnd whenever my prospects seemed<br />\ndiscouraging, I gave some thought to<br />\ngraduate school, law school, and<br />\njournalism school. At least I could sleep.<br />\nnights knowing I could fall back on these<br />\n- more<br />\npossibilities and give myself some<br />\ntime.<br />\nRules of the Game<br />\nBut having the credits to get out early,<br />\nI saw no reason to stay on any longer.<br />\nAnd having played the academic game for<br />\nsixteen years, I franklyfelt tired of it and<br />\nsaw no purpose in continuing to play it.<br />\nIf the only thing that was keePing me in<br />\nacademia was security, then maybe what<br />\nI needed most was to force myself to face<br />\nthe world. As Sartre said, one always has<br />\nthe option of exit (maybe I did learn<br />\nsomething from those two philosophy<br />\ncourses) and that's what I chose.<br />\nAfter going to school for sixteen years,<br />\nI find that it is what I best know how to<br />\ndo. So severing tile umbilical cord is<br />\ncomewhat painful. Already I feel left out<br />\nof things as my friends pore over the<br />\ncourse listings for next term and are<br />\nbusily filling out applications and<br />\nawaiting results of M.C.A.T.'s, L.S.A.T.'s,<br />\nand G.R.E.'s.<br />\n<br />\nBut there's something to be said for<br />\nindependence, however intangible it may<br />\nbe. At this point in my life, the important.<br />\nthing is to find the kind of job in which<br />\ncan best fulfill myself. Having more<br />\ndegrees might help in this quest, but who<br />\nknows? I'll spend as much time as it takes<br />\nto find a job that will be more than just<br />\n\"a job.\"<br />\nThe irony of my feelings about<br />\nHopkins is that its guiding philosophy is<br />\nto instill a sense of self-reliance in the<br />\nindividual by not coddling him.(As one<br />\nof my professors jokingly said: \"You<br />\ncame to college to get away from your<br />\nparents; we just make it easy for you to<br />\nget away from your teachers, too.\").<br />\nHowever impersonal this place is<br />\nsupposed to be, it has been good enough<br />\nto me to make me realize that 1'11 miss it.<br />\nI'm not too fearful about going out<br />\ninto the real world. History tells me I<br />\nhave no need to be. After all, Columbus<br />\ndidn't fall off tne earth.

In,<br />\n<br />\n\fdecember 5, 1972/news-letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nNectons make big splash at Penn Relays<br />\nThe swimming team opened its<br />\nseason with a trip to the Penn<br />\nRelays this past weekend.<br />\nHopkins finished in sixth place,<br />\nscoring 156 points. Strictly a<br />\nrelay meet, it proved the strength.<br />\nand depth of the team.<br />\nMaryland, winner of the meet<br />\nsince its inception, again finished<br />\nfirst with 314 points followed by<br />\nBucknell (218), East Carolina<br />\n(208), West Virginia (202),<br />\nPittsburgh (172) and Hopkins.<br />\nBehind Hopkins were such<br />\nPowers as La Salle, St.<br />\nBonaventura, Penn State, Brown'<br />\nand Villanova. The Jays were the<br />\nonly College Division team to<br />\nscore significantly in the meet.<br />\n. Only 15<br />\nMaryland won five events<br />\nWhile Hopkins won two, the only<br />\nteams in the meet to win more<br />\nthan one event. Since only 15<br />\nswimmers competed for Hopkins,<br />\nthe feat is more remarkable.<br />\nOne of the events that the<br />\nBlue Jays won was the premiere<br />\nevent\u2014the crescendo relay in<br />\nWhich five swimmers cover a<br />\ntotal distance of 500 yards. Two<br />\nmen swim 50 yards, 2-100 yards,<br />\nand one 200 yards. \"To win this<br />\nevent, you must have five stud<br />\nswimmers,\u2014 enthused Coach<br />\nFrank Comfort.<br />\nCovered<br />\nFor Hopkins, Jim Finnertz led<br />\noff with a 23.3 for 50 followed<br />\nby Vince Nizrelli with a 50.7 for<br />\n100. Bill Milne covered 200 yards<br />\nin 1.47 followed by Mark<br />\nHorning with a 48.5 for 100 and<br />\nBob Schwenkler with a 22.3 for<br />\nthe final 50 yards. The total time<br />\nWas 4 minutes, 11.74 seconds<br />\nWith Maryland .19 seconds<br />\nbehind.<br />\nThe other victory came in the<br />\n<br />\n400 yard butterfly relay with a<br />\ncombined time of 3:38.07 for<br />\nHopkins followed by Maryland<br />\nwith a 3:39.19. Swimming for<br />\nthe Blue Jays were Nigrelli<br />\n(57.2), Tom Stenovec (57.6),<br />\nHorning (52.3) and Milne (51.9).<br />\nMore Scores<br />\nIn the 400 yard freestyle relay<br />\nand 400 yard backstroke relay,<br />\nHopkins placed seventh. The 400<br />\nyard freestyle relay produced a<br />\nfifth while the 200 yard freestyle<br />\nrelay team garnered a sixth. In<br />\nthe 200 and 400 yard medley<br />\nrelays, Hopkins placed ninth<br />\nwhile its 400 individual medley<br />\nrelay finished eight.<br />\nTo appreciate the significance<br />\nof the showing, it should be<br />\npointed out that of the first<br />\nseven teams, only Hopkins and<br />\nBucknell do not give swimming<br />\nscholarships. As Coach Comfort<br />\nstated, \"It was great to surprise<br />\nsome people in a big meet. All of<br />\nthe top swimming teams on the<br />\nEast Coast with the exception of<br />\nthe Ivies were there.\" Since the<br />\nshorter sprint relays are not the<br />\nstrength of the team; Hopkins<br />\ncould do a lot of surprising in its<br />\ndual meet schedule this year.<br />\nGone from last year's list of.<br />\nvictims are Penn State, PMC<br />\n(Widener), Drexel, and Towson.<br />\nInstead of continuing the 15 dual<br />\nmeet schedule, Comfort opted<br />\nfor only 10 dual meets. However,<br />\nsix of the meets are against such<br />\nUniversity Division teams as<br />\nMaryland, Connecticut, and<br />\nNavy.<br />\nHopes<br />\n\"One of our hopes is to<br />\nimprove on our sixth place finish<br />\nof last year at the NCAA College<br />\nDivision Nationals,\u2014 stated<br />\nComfort. The only significant<br />\n<br />\nI3-ballers bounce back,<br />\ntake third in tourney<br />\nAfter their initial loss to<br />\nTowson in the Schaefer Metro<br />\nClassics, the Blue Jay basketball<br />\n.team recorded consecutive<br />\nvictories over Coppin State and<br />\nUMBC on Friday and Saturday<br />\nevenings.<br />\nThe Coppin game was fairly<br />\nclose until five minutes had<br />\nelapsed in the second half. Then<br />\nHopkins went on a tear,<br />\noutscoring their opponents by an<br />\n18-6 margin. It was a laugher<br />\nfrom then until the final buzzer<br />\nsignalled the end of the game<br />\nWith Hopkins on top 98-72.<br />\nLeading the Blue Jays with 23<br />\nPoints was Paul Spence followed<br />\nby Bob Freedman with 22 points<br />\nand 5 assists. Billy Jews threw in<br />\n16 and picked off 11 rebounds.<br />\nGrey DeLong had lu points<br />\nWhile John Rutter scored nine<br />\nand recorded seven assists.<br />\nThe Saturday contest was<br />\nanything but a laugher. UMBC<br />\ngave the Blue Jays fits all<br />\nevening, but Hopkins pulled out<br />\na 79-72 decision. Leading<br />\nHopkins in scoring was Freedman<br />\nWith 23 followed by Jews with<br />\n17.<br />\nBut the story of the game was<br />\nsenior walk-on Al Robinson.<br />\nNearing the end of the first half,<br />\n<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert inserted<br />\nRobinson into the game. Al<br />\npromptly turned things around<br />\nwith his defensive work,<br />\nballhandling, shooting and<br />\npassing.<br />\nAt one point in the second<br />\nhalf, Jews, Freedman, and Rutter<br />\nwere all riding the bench with<br />\nfour personal fouls. Robinson<br />\ncontrolled the game and kept the<br />\nBlue Jays in the contest with his<br />\nleadership. He finished the game<br />\nwith a perfect shooting<br />\npercentage of 1.000 (5 for 5)<br />\nfrom the floor. Near the end of<br />\nthe game, Rupert substituted for<br />\nRobinson. As he ran off the<br />\ncourt, he received a standing<br />\novation from the crowd.<br />\nMorgan won the tournament<br />\nwith a 63-62 victory over host<br />\nTowson State. Baltimore<br />\nUniversity climbed third with a<br />\nvictory over Loyola. Next came<br />\nHopkins, UMBC, and Coppin.<br />\nHopkins forward Billy Jews<br />\ndeserved a spot on the<br />\nAll-Tournament team, but did<br />\nnot get it. He was the third leading<br />\nscorer and fourth leading<br />\nrebounder.

The<br />\noutcome seemed to justify Coach<br />\nOles' hopes that \"this could be<br />\nthe best year Hopkins fencing<br />\never had.\"<br />\nFor those new to the<br />\nswashbuckling sport, there are<br />\nthree different weapons used in<br />\nintercollegiate competition\u2014<br />\nepee, foil and sobre\u2014which vary<br />\nin weight and are governed by<br />\nslightly different scoring rules.<br />\nCompetitors in the epee class are<br />\nallowed to \"hit\" their adversaries<br />\nanywhere on the body (within<br />\nreason), while foil and.sabre<br />\nswordsmen are restricted to the<br />\nmiddle torso and above the waist,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nTouches<br />\nThere are three starters in each<br />\nweapon, who fence each of three<br />\nopponents in round-robin.<br />\nfashion, for a total of nine bouts<br />\nper weapon and 27<br />\nconfrontations per meet.

That same year, before<br />\nIcollege separated us, my friend and I drew up a<br />\nJoint will in the presence of a lawyer.

In his final paragraph he admitted<br />\nthat his siphon was skipping and he feared<br />\nitnminent death. This fear was somehow linked<br />\nWith a failure to lift and carry a set of bar-bells put his hand on my chest so that I ,could feel my<br />\nat the hospital's therapy center. I could not own breathes and he said \"You've got a pump<br />\nunderstand why he needed to carry a weight that keeps you going, and now our place has got<br />\nWhich most healthy men could not lift.

And since that wheel was under my<br />\n4rid swamps was sold for tax debts.

For 'got to it in time.' And I am proud to say, due to<br />\n41 onth s thereafter I envisioned Hector's left my sleepless nights, tht wooden. wheel never<br />\nntricle in my sleep and thought I saw his sipon stopped until the day my villa was auctioned and<br />\nthe swamps were drained.<br />\nPuinping out the last of my beloved swamps.<br />\nHow brilliantly the water<br />\nthe<br />\nship's wheel, a much faster and<br />\nfrom<br />\nsprayed<br />\nLosing interest in land, I<br />\nmechanism<br />\nthan the pump at home. I<br />\nbecame adept at photography and did unusual stronger<br />\ntricks with shadows.<br />\n<br />\nThe Wheel Mechanism<br />\n<br />\nwanted a picture of its mowers ploughing up the<br />\nsea, for it brought back wonderful memories and<br />\nthat old sense of duty I had toward keeping my<br />\nhome alive. Grabbing my camera, I found a place<br />\non deck where light was scarce and from there I<br />\ntook twelve snapshots of the wheel in motion.<br />\nFocusing through the lens, I could sec no hub or<br />\nspokes, but a breaking wave which never spent<br />\nitself and never reached a shoreline.<br />\nOnce I had exhausted the film, I<br />\nwas not satisfied to let the negatives sit in their<br />\nsprockets, but wanted to develop them within the<br />\nhour. I tried to turn my cabin into a darkroom<br />\nby pulling the shade and stripping the window<br />\nwith tar paper, but still I could find my way<br />\naround without\\ tripping over furniture. Despite<br />\nthis extraneous light. I began transferring the film<br />\nfrom one container to another when the door<br />\nburst open sending in floods of daylight and<br />\ncausing me to clrfcp the plastic cylinder with its<br />\nfilm unravelling across the floor. In the door way,<br />\na bell captain stared speechless at the darkened<br />\nroom. I confronted him in uncontrollable anger.<br />\n\"What the hell do you want?\" I shouted, \"Do<br />\nyou know what you've done? Do you know what<br />\nyou've ruined? Never in my life have I aborted a<br />\nnegative. What in hell was so important for you<br />\nto come bursting in without warning?\"<br />\nHe answered, \"I've got to have<br />\nyour ticket.\"<br />\n\"Damn it you idiot, get out of<br />\nhere.\" I picked up a bottle of sodium carbonate<br />\nand hurled it at the slamming door. In all my<br />\nyears as a practicing photographer I had never<br />\nbeen interrupted during the process of developing<br />\nfilm: nor had I ever lost a negative, nor had I<br />\never dropped a container or broken a bottle of<br />\ncaustics. Losing these negatives \u2014 above all others<br />\nthese \u2014 over the issue of a ticket made me burn<br />\nwith rage. It was as if I had my home in Florida<br />\nsnatched from me all over again. No, it was more<br />\nthan this. It was as if I had a part of my brain<br />\ntorn away. For no one can understand how<br />\nimportant my negatives are to me. No one can<br />\nunderstand why I define my negatives carefully<br />\nand handle them with lead gloves. To me they are<br />\nthe sources and not to be tossed away like final<br />\nprints. They are the sources. At my feet, the<br />\nempty container rolled back and forth- in half<br />\ncircles. I sat on the floor and fingered the<br />\nphotographs I would never see. \"So,\" I reasoned,<br />\n\"I can bring my camera and suitcases and even<br />\nmy car with my bicycle strapped to the trunk but<br />\nhave to leave my negatives in the ship's<br />\nincinerator.\" I kicked my camera under a chair<br />\nand walked out on deck.<br />\nI had been at the rail for an<br />\nhour when an incident occurred which made an<br />\ncontinued on page 4<br />\n<br />\n\fThe Crows/The Men<br />\nThe Crows:<br />\nThe evening dusk settles on<br />\nthe land like a brown ash.<br />\nThe clouds ladder their way<br />\nto the horizon and through them<br />\nwe watch the last blues of sky.<br />\nPerhaps, tonight, the powder snow will come.<br />\n<br />\nMiddled Steepled House<br />\nA city dressed for the evening mattina.<br />\nLittle Vanity.<br />\nShe's the girl next door.<br />\nShe wants satin dresses, fancy shoes and<br />\na fella to choose.<br />\nPouting<br />\nstamping<br />\ntantrums and wants are the toys she plays<br />\nwith.<br />\nOld mom, you work so hard, and really cherish<br />\nher so can't you see her seasons changing.<br />\n<br />\nThe Men:<br />\nEven on clear nights<br />\nthe moon does not come.<br />\nOn cloudness nights<br />\nthere are no stars.<br />\nThe crows own the night.<br />\nThe night<br />\nis the great crow's wing.<br />\nThe crows lay their eggs<br />\nin the dead's clothes.<br />\nDeath's skull is a pale egg.<br />\n<br />\nYou'd like to see her get it better.<br />\nThe nest seems too small.<br />\nNot being with it makes life a bore.<br />\nThis nightowl got wings to take to the<br />\nflight.<br />\nI've seen her take to the night.<br />\nWhile a tiny neighborhood slumbers away<br />\nand mother sleeps on the third floor<br />\nsteepled apartment.<br />\n<br />\n-40<br />\nSee,.<br />\n<br />\n.0.\u2022<br />\n**<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022;\u2022,\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nlr\u2022\u2022<br />\n- -\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n-\u20227\u2022;\u2022;<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nSomeone's got her in a spell.<br />\nYou're just an old fool.<br />\nIf you keep it up you'll end up in a<br />\nwitch's pool.<br />\nI know what's happened to her, and I know<br />\nthis valley and the power of those dark<br />\nallies.<br />\nThe movie scared me.<br />\nI dared her.<br />\nI cried, oh my lord.<br />\nShe teased me with death on her breath.<br />\nSomeone's got her in a spell.<br />\nYou're just an old fool.<br />\nIf you keep it up you'll end up in a<br />\nwitch's pool.<br />\nI know what's happened to her, I know<br />\nthe valley and the power of those dark<br />\nallies.<br />\nLittle Vanity got her crepe and she'll<br />\nsmother you with bribes and sneaks.<br />\nshe's the vita to a band.<br />\nHitting sour notes with her mom and other<br />\nfolks.<br />\nShe's down a colored road<br />\nYellow down<br />\nBlue down<br />\nBlack down<br />\n<br />\nThe Crows:<br />\nWhen the snow comes, it is pale.<br />\nWe can never be snow.<br />\nThe nights are long and our young,<br />\nnested far over the hills and high in the trees,<br />\nawait their food.<br />\nIn the town, the fires rise in each house.<br />\nWhen the night freezes our breath, we think<br />\nhow warm those homes must be.<br />\nThe Men:<br />\nWe are cursed<br />\nto wander the unlit rooms of the earth.<br />\nThe world is flat;<br />\nthe clouds boil from edge to edge.<br />\n<br />\nAshen clouds with sun speckles<br />\nSkip over the frosted fields<br />\nAs a gray man<br />\nBarely brings his sickle to a whisper.<br />\nHis motions no longer<br />\nFlow like waves over the grass.<br />\nEach day the weeds<br />\nSeem to stiffen<br />\nAs his blade dulls.<br />\nHe has so far to go.<br />\nEven the sun that befriends him<br />\nHas grown old and its breath<br />\nIs unable to restore life lost.<br />\nLooking up, he watches<br />\nHis friend close its gray eyelid<br />\nfor the last time.<br />\n<br />\nThe Crows (turning):<br />\nThe clouds do more than that.<br />\nThe earth is round.<br />\nJames Taylor<br />\n<br />\nIt has been a night of storms.<br />\nThe oar blades glisten<br />\nAs the water slides by us<br />\nIn the dark.

AND ONE FOR MY FRIEND, HERE!'<br /><br />\nletters to the editors<br />\nDebate Council<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nJournalistic deadlines frequently make<br />\nhasty investigation of facts and issues a<br />\nnecessity for anyone who expects to see<br />\nhis story go to press. The News-Letter<br />\nunfortunately faces these same pressures,<br />\nwhich torment all of America's<br />\nmultimedia endeavors. When such<br />\nconsiderations occasionally produce an<br />\ninflammatory and jaundiced article, it<br />\nthen becomes the chore of the offended<br />\nparty to offer a belated second side to the<br />\nissue and hope that the damage is not<br />\nirreparable. It is thus that I take quill in<br />\nhand to defend my slandered<br />\norganization, the Johns Hopkins Debate<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nI must first point out that the author<br />\nof Friday's article, entitled (for the sheer<br />\nenjoyment of any posthumous admirers<br />\nof William Randolph Hearst) \"Debate<br />\nCouncil ,Fails To Show Just Cause,\"<br />\nconducted an \"interview\" which<br />\nconsisted of asking me a few innocuous<br />\nquestions while I was eating a tuna fish<br />\nsandwich one day last week in Levering<br />\nHall. Only when I received a follow-up<br />\nphone call on Thursday evening (when,<br />\naccording to the author nearly the entire<br />\narticle had already been written), did l<br />\n/17terviewe<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\na-<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\ne mem er ,cthe<br /><br />\nignoring<br />\nNews-Letter staff. By effectively<br />\n-<br /><br />\nvirtually all of the limited information he<br />\nbothered to request of me, he was able to<br />\ncreate a-ve-rY one-sided \"controversy\" for<br />\nFriday's edition. Nevertheless, the story<br />\naddressed itself to several aspects of the<br />\nDebate Council's operations which<br />\ndeserve comment.<br />\nFirst, there has been some question as<br />\nto who benefits by the debate program.<br />\nThe most obvious response is: The<br />\nDebate Council members themselves. Not<br />\nonly does debating constitute refinement<br />\nof forensic qualities and an active<br />\ninvolvement in scholarly research, but it<br />\nis a crucial preparation for many students<br />\nwho intend to pursue graduate studies,<br />\nparticularly in law schools. Debating has<br />\nconsistently proven to be one of the most<br />\nvaluable extracurriculars that a student<br />\ncan be involved in.<br />\nSecond, it has been pointed out that<br />\nthe size of the budget relative to the<br />\nnumber of members\u2014or the per-person<br />\ncost\u2014is probably higher than many other<br />\nstudent activities. This truism must be<br />\nconsidered in light of the fact that it is<br />\nthe only organization that engages in<br />\nintercollegiate competition and is one of<br />\nthe 2 activities that does any travelling.<br /><br />\nThese items comprise most of our yearly<br />\nexpenditure. The amount we receive,<br />\nhowever, is drastically lower than the<br />\nbudgets provided by the schools against<br />\nwhich we compete and compares<br />\nfavorably with Hopkins other competitive<br />\nefforts (i.e. the Athletic Programs).<br />\nA third issue that people have<br />\ndiscussed with me is the number of<br />\nmenii)ers in the activity. This is an<br />\nimportant consideration because if the<br />\nCouncil's membership were to drop<br />\nsharply in the future, it would probably<br />\nbe politically more expedient to have a<br />\ncommensurate reduction in the Debate<br />\nCouncil's budget than to upgrade the<br />\nscope and quality of the Council's<br />\nactivities. As a result, this year's officers<br />\nhave engaged in a more extensive<br />\nrecruiting effort directed at the freshman<br />\nclass than ever before. The very<br />\nencouraging result is that this year's<br />\nDebate Council has a MAJORITY of<br />\nfreshmen and novices in its ranks. By<br />\ncontinuing this effort next fall, the<br />\n1973-74 Debate Council will become one<br />\nof the largest such organizations on the<br />\nEast Coast. The Student Council and<br />\nStudent Activites Commission have been<br />\nenthusiastic supporters of this enrollment<br />\neffort.<br />\nQuestion number 4 has frequently<br />\n\u2022e.a e<br /><br />\n))<br /><br />\nIn which Ms. Toth views three feministfilms<br />\nBy EMILY TOTH<br />\nWhat is female culture? To help answer<br />\nthis question, the staff of Women: A<br />\nJournal of Liberation held \"An Evening<br />\nof Women's Films\" SunGay nibilt at<br />\nBarclay School. An audience of women,<br />\nmen, and squirming children saw three<br />\nfilms by women about women.<br />\nThe first, \"The Women's Film,\"<br />\nsuggested female culture involves new<br />\nperceptions of one's life. In the film<br />\n(made by Newsreel, a femle.-male<br />\ncollective), women talk about how they<br />\nsee themselves. They don't accept<br />\nsociety's definitions for women's<br />\nhappiness. The women are Black, poor;<br />\npretty, white, middle-class; Chicano<br />\nsharecroppers; welfare mothers. But<br />\ncertain corm:Ion denominators emerge<br />\nfrom the start.<br />\nThe opening images are stills of old or<br />\nsuffering or no-longer-beautiful women,<br />\nwhile Aretha Franklin sings I Can't Get<br />\nNo Satisfaction. Hands change diapers,<br />\nmake sandwiches, sweep floors. Only the<br />\nhands are shown: the women are<br />\ninvisible. The work is the work done by<br />\nall those in the female condition.<br />\nNumerous women talk about their<br />\nunhappy marriagies. They were<br />\ncon ditoned to think of marriage as<br />\n\"undying, love:' They<br /><br />\nbelieved they<br /><br />\nwomen<br /><br />\nfind this<br /><br />\nboylowed<br /><br />\nidentity<br /><br />\nincluded me.\" In New York, she had to<br />\nlearn how to shop, how to cross busy<br />\nstreets, how to let the water out of hotel<br />\nbathtubs.<br />\nBut she also turned a hobby into<br />\nproductive work: she became an artist.<br />\nVery few women artists have happy<br />\nmarriages, she points out. As a housewife,<br />\nher life was regulated by chores done for<br />\nothers; now, as an artist, she disciplines<br />\nher life herself, for her own work.<br />\nMay Wilson's art is eccentric: portraits<br />\nand junk assemblage. There are portraits<br />\nof her head, on the bodies ofjockeys and<br />\ncoal miners and Whistler's mother;<br />\nmontages of herself picking her nose, in<br />\nthe style of 25-cent-picture booth<br />\nportraits; old high heels and baby dolls,<br />\nsprayed in bright colors and placed in odd<br />\njuxtapositions.<br />\nFemale culture would certainly include<br />\nthis \"Grandma Moses of the<br />\nUnderground\", who is portrayed entirely<br />\nin her own words. But art is a very rare<br />\nescape for a woman. More commonly, as<br />\nin \"The Women's Film,\" she is limited by<br />\neconomics or social conditioning\u2014or, as<br />\nin \"It Happens to Us,\" by her biology. . .<br />\nThis third film is about abortion. One<br />\nwoman tells of her illegal coathanger<br />\nabortion, while her father stood over her<br /><br />\nwoman's abortion\u2014and the man answers<br />\nall the questions. He's always feared<br />\npregnancy, he says; especially now, while<br />\nhe's still in school. The abortion made<br />\nhim less fearful, and was good for his<br />\nfeelings about sex. His roomate, the<br />\nabortionee, miles silently while he '<br />\ndefines her life.<br />\n\"It Happens to Us\" is an informative<br />\nfilm: it contains interviews, statistics, and<br />\ndescriptions of types of abortion. But it<br />\ndeals only with women's control over<br />\ntheir bodies, and suggests that (in at least<br />\none case) even abortion is taken over as<br />\npart of the man's life-experience.<br />\nAll three films show some women<br />\ntrying to define themselves, rather than<br />\naccepting society's or men's definitions.<br />\nWe see the women through women.\u2022<br />\ndirectors' eyes: until recently, this view<br />\nwas rarely possible. The Rothschild films<br />\nare made for New Day Films, formed last<br />\nyear by Rothschild and two other women<br />\nto make and distribute films more<br />\ncheaply than standard corporations<br />\npermit. Collectives like New Day allow<br />\nwomen filmmakers more artistic and<br />\nfinancial freedom in portraying a female<br />\nculture.<br />\nThe portraits in these films are made<br />\nthrough talking--more characteristic of<br /><br />\nand berated her for havin<br /><br />\nwomen's worl<br /><br />\nsex out of<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\nanswer is EVERY type of forensic<br />\nfunction that its members are interested<br />\nin during any given year. This frequently<br />\npeech competition; debate<br />\ninclude<br />\ntournaments on he national resolution;<br />\nmodel congresses!' audience debates; and<br />\ndebates on propositions other than the<br />\nnational topic. In addition we sponsor a<br />\nmajor intercollegiate debate tournament<br />\nin the fall and a high school tournament<br />\nduring the spring semester.<br />\nIt is extremely important for a Student<br />\nCouncil to assure itself and its<br />\nconstituency that whatever money it<br />\nallocates is going to worthwhile<br />\nendeavors. One of the responsibilities of<br />\nany organization head is to explain the<br />\nfunctions and breadth of activities that its<br />\nlevel of funding allows. It would, of<br />\ncourse, be helpful if an organization were<br />\nasked to defend itself BEFORE someone<br />\ntries to conclude that it \"fails to show<br />\nJust cause\". With respect to debating at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, I can only claim that the<br />\ncause is indeed just and hope that this<br />\nephemeral controversy will return to its<br />\njust obscurity.<br /><br />\nEd Stehlik<br />\nPresident, Debate Council<br /><br />\nbitterly, that she wanted to<br /><br />\nmarry so she could spend her time eating<br />\ncandy bars and drinking Pepsi Cola. But<br />\nher marriage was so bad that she \"forgot<br />\nabout the Pepsi Cola.\" For lack of<br />\nalternatives, another woman spent sixteen<br /><br />\nlaughing<br /><br />\ninto the ATO house on North Calvert. We<br />\nwere struck with horror to see every<br />\nyoung man wearing a jacket and tie, and<br />\nevery young woman wearing a dress. This<br />\nwas a pledge party, a rite de passage,<br />\nsomething to make the initiate feel like a<br />\nBrother. We felt out of place and left.<br />\nThe Delta Phi party seemed more<br />\nleisurely, in contrast \u2014 possibly because<br />\nthe frat boys there have given up<br />\nnormally feeble attempts to justify their<br />\ncorporate existence and, decked with all<br />\nthe frills of fraternity life, including the<br />\nubiquitous annual membership photos,<br />\nhave come to see themselves as instances<br />\nof societal decline.<br />\nSo, noting color prints throughout the<br />\nhouse, a fire in the quasi-Georgian living<br />\nroom fireplace, occasional oriental rugs<br />\non the floor, a four-volume American<br />\n(Houghton-Mifflin) edition of Bleak<br />\nHouse (1863) and a Harvard Alumni<br />\nDirectory (1960), we made our way<br />\ndownstairs in search of dancing. space<br />\nand a couple beers.<br />\nWe found more than we had expected.<br />\nFor a chapter almost constantly rumored<br />\nto be on the skids, the Delta Phi boys<br />\naren't doing too bad, thank you.<br />\nThe place was packed.

The interviewer asks about the<br /><br />\nthese limits, we can't yet define the<br />\npossibilities of female culture.

The Delta Phi's, you may recall,<br />\nwere featured in a special September<br />\nEsquire spread on American college<br />\nyouth, wherin the point was made that<br />\nour frat boys are trendy followers of the<br />\ninternational jet set, with a five year lag<br />\nthrown in for good measure.<br />\nIt wasn't a bad party, as rush parties<br />\ngo. We arrived at 9:30, to find mearly a<br />\nhundred souls, listening to the band,<br />\nvariously known as the \"Homewood<br />\nDead\" or the \"Woodstock Nation, 1972.\"<br />\nThe frat boys used to have a rule about<br />\nlot being able to hire bands for their rush<br />\n)arties, even if the members were all<br />\nFloppies, but like most other rules, it's<br />\nflexible.<br />\nDress .at frat parties is apt to range<br />\nfrom backless evening gowns with the<br />\nfront slit to the waist, to sweaters and<br />\njeans. Some frat boys wear jackets.<br />\n* * *<br />\nLast year, for example, we wanaereu<br /><br />\nyears married to a man who tied a string<br />\nacross the front door to know if she'd<br />\nbeen out in his absence.<br />\nOther common themes are fear and<br />\nconfinement. Chicanos fear \"gringos.\"<br />\nSecretaries are confined to the typewriter<br />\nand function as office housewives:<br />\nhanging up coats, making coffee.<br />\nTelephone operators fear taking too long<br />\nin the bathroom and losing their jobs.<br />\nWelfare mothers are confined to celibacy<br />\nif they want to continue receiving their<br />\nchecks. All are forced into passive roles.<br />\nInterviews with women are intercut<br />\nwith still photographs and voice-overs.<br />\nAfter a Black woman says \"the<br />\noccupations of Black men and women are<br />\nset at birth,\" stills of slave auctions<br />\nappear, with an auctioneer's voice<br />\nextolling the qualities of a female slave:<br />\n\"fine body... fit for breeding....\"<br />\nThe film begins with individual<br />\nwomen, but moves to a critique of<br />\nsociety. Says one middle-class woman,<br />\n\"We think the problem is the individual's,<br />\nbut we've all defined ourselves in terms of<br />\nmen.\" There is a female culture in that all<br />\nwomen are conditioned to expect<br />\nhappiness through relationship to men:<br />\none woman takes her husband's place on<br />\na picket line when he is arrested. Most<br /><br />\nmanaged to serve some mighty fine brew<br />\n(Dortmunder).<br />\nTechnique has always meant something<br />\nspecial to the frat boys. Behind the<br />\nten-foot long bar, there are three Brothers<br />\nrunning around. We had to wait ten<br />\nminutes to be served. One freshman notes<br />\ntoo much foam in his beer, and asks the<br />\ntall, mechanical bartender to put his<br />\nfingers over the spout.<br />\n\"This is the way we do it here,\" the<br />\nBrother remarks. His voice carried a sense<br />\nof conviction.<br />\nTen minutes later, another Brother,<br />\nthis one a member of the fencing team, is<br />\nserving. He fingers never leave the spout.<br />\nThere is no more foam. There will always<br />\nbe dissention in the ranks.<br />\n* * *<br />\nConsider the following line:<br />\n\"Hi, my name is Martin. Are you from<br />\nHopkins or from Goucher?\" Breaking the<br />\nice has always been a problem. One<br />\nsupposes that there will always be lonely<br />\npeople, waiting to meet other lonely<br />\npeople. In an atmosphere of pressure and<br />\ndistrust, one may assume that the<br />\nfraternities will survive, as islands of<br />\nconsolation in a tired world.<br />\nWe left with a slight headache, to work<br />\nthe graveyard shift at the Hopkins<br />\nswitchboard.<br /><br />\na massive security blanket which serves to<br />\npostpone the day when you filially have<br />\nto confront the real world.<br />\nReality is a tight job market. Reality is<br />\ngetting letters from Mom with no checks<br />\nenclosed. Reality is having to wear a coat<br />\nand tie, instead of dungarees, being called<br />\nMr. Cantor, and not Joe, and having to<br />\nconsult H. &amp; R. Block before filling out<br />\ntax returns, instead of just assuming there<br />\nwill be a refund check forthcoming.<br />\nSecurity, on the other hand, is going to<br />\nschool for as long as you want, either to<br />\nbroaden your horizons or to increase the<br />\npossibility of eventually landing a job.<br />\n(We all know how easy it is to find work<br />\nwith an M.A. or Ph.D.) Security is having<br />\nas long as you want to turn in a paper,<br />\nwatching deadline give way to deadline,<br />\nto incomplete, back to deadline.<br />\nSecurity is being able to go through an<br />\nentire day, the only constructive<br />\naccomplishments having been to prepare<br />\ndinner and read the New York _Times.<br />\nSecurity is flaying all the time in the<br />\nworld to discuss politics and The New<br />\nMorality, and not have to worry about<br /><br />\ncatcning a train or a bus.<br />\nIf this isn't security, why then is there<br />\nsuch competition to get into colleges,<br />\ngraduate schools, and professional<br />\nschools? Acceptance at one of these<br />\ninstitutions buys a person three or four or<br />\nfive more years before having to face up<br /><br />\nto the next big step. And what about<br />\nthose poor, insecure souls who can never<br />\nbear to get off the ladder and wind up as<br />\nfull professors?<br />\nI don't want to cast aspersions on<br />\nthose who really did come for an<br />\neducation (even I have learned a few<br />\n.things here, academically speaking). I just<br />\nwant to point out what a strange thing<br />\nsecurity is and how it can lead to all sorts<br />\nof self-deceptions and illusions.<br />\nFor instance, I came to Hopkins not<br />\nhaving relinquished my ten year dream of<br />\nbecoming President. By the middle of<br />\nfreshman year, it was to be a big-time<br />\njournalist with the option of running for<br />\nthe Senate from there. Sophomore year<br />\nfound me dreaming of being a competent<br />\nreporter for a newspaper. With only two<br />\nyears to go before having to choose, I<br />\nlowered it to an obscure politico working<br />\nfor someone I admired. And with one<br />\nyear left, I gave serious thought to<br />\nteaching high school. From the White<br />\nHouse to the school house in just three<br />\nyears; what a meteoric decline in<br />\nexpectations!<br />\nAnd whenever my prospects seemed<br />\ndiscouraging, I gave some thought to<br />\ngraduate school, law school, and<br />\njournalism school. At least I could sleep.<br />\nnights knowing I could fall back on these<br />\n- more<br />\npossibilities and give myself some<br />\ntime.<br />\nRules of the Game<br />\nBut having the credits to get out early,<br />\nI saw no reason to stay on any longer.<br />\nAnd having played the academic game for<br />\nsixteen years, I franklyfelt tired of it and<br />\nsaw no purpose in continuing to play it.<br />\nIf the only thing that was keePing me in<br />\nacademia was security, then maybe what<br />\nI needed most was to force myself to face<br />\nthe world. As Sartre said, one always has<br />\nthe option of exit (maybe I did learn<br />\nsomething from those two philosophy<br />\ncourses) and that's what I chose.<br />\nAfter going to school for sixteen years,<br />\nI find that it is what I best know how to<br />\ndo. So severing tile umbilical cord is<br />\ncomewhat painful. Already I feel left out<br />\nof things as my friends pore over the<br />\ncourse listings for next term and are<br />\nbusily filling out applications and<br />\nawaiting results of M.C.A.T.'s, L.S.A.T.'s,<br />\nand G.R.E.'s.<br /><br />\nBut there's something to be said for<br />\nindependence, however intangible it may<br />\nbe. At this point in my life, the important.<br />\nthing is to find the kind of job in which<br />\ncan best fulfill myself. Having more<br />\ndegrees might help in this quest, but who<br />\nknows? I'll spend as much time as it takes<br />\nto find a job that will be more than just<br />\n\"a job.\"<br />\nThe irony of my feelings about<br />\nHopkins is that its guiding philosophy is<br />\nto instill a sense of self-reliance in the<br />\nindividual by not coddling him.(As one<br />\nof my professors jokingly said: \"You<br />\ncame to college to get away from your<br />\nparents; we just make it easy for you to<br />\nget away from your teachers, too.\").<br />\nHowever impersonal this place is<br />\nsupposed to be, it has been good enough<br />\nto me to make me realize that 1'11 miss it.<br />\nI'm not too fearful about going out<br />\ninto the real world. History tells me I<br />\nhave no need to be. After all, Columbus<br />\ndidn't fall off tne earth. He stumbled<br />\nupon America.<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/december 5,1972<br /><br />\nSalomon's S-505 won't let go,unless...<br />\nUnless you take a turn for the worst.

Dean of Academic<br />\nPrograms and CUS chairman<br />\nSigmund Suskind said, \"My<br />\nmajor reservation is that this<br />\nproposal relegates the Pass/Fail<br />\nto a C or a D.\" He added.<br />\n\"Eventually people around here<br />\nand at other institutions will<br />\nbegin to realize that the Hopkins<br />\npass is a bust.\"<br />\nSuskind Sez<br />\n\"The second objection I have<br />\nis that when a student takes the<br />\nPass/Fail he is taking a risk, he is<br />\ngambling.

In,<br /><br />\ndecember 5, 1972/news-letter/page 11<br /><br />\nNectons make big splash at Penn Relays<br />\nThe swimming team opened its<br />\nseason with a trip to the Penn<br />\nRelays this past weekend.<br />\nHopkins finished in sixth place,<br />\nscoring 156 points. Strictly a<br />\nrelay meet, it proved the strength.<br />\nand depth of the team.<br />\nMaryland, winner of the meet<br />\nsince its inception, again finished<br />\nfirst with 314 points followed by<br />\nBucknell (218), East Carolina<br />\n(208), West Virginia (202),<br />\nPittsburgh (172) and Hopkins.<br />\nBehind Hopkins were such<br />\nPowers as La Salle, St.<br />\nBonaventura, Penn State, Brown'<br />\nand Villanova. The Jays were the<br />\nonly College Division team to<br />\nscore significantly in the meet.<br />\n. Only 15<br />\nMaryland won five events<br />\nWhile Hopkins won two, the only<br />\nteams in the meet to win more<br />\nthan one event. Since only 15<br />\nswimmers competed for Hopkins,<br />\nthe feat is more remarkable.<br />\nOne of the events that the<br />\nBlue Jays won was the premiere<br />\nevent\u2014the crescendo relay in<br />\nWhich five swimmers cover a<br />\ntotal distance of 500 yards. Two<br />\nmen swim 50 yards, 2-100 yards,<br />\nand one 200 yards. \"To win this<br />\nevent, you must have five stud<br />\nswimmers,\u2014 enthused Coach<br />\nFrank Comfort.<br />\nCovered<br />\nFor Hopkins, Jim Finnertz led<br />\noff with a 23.3 for 50 followed<br />\nby Vince Nizrelli with a 50.7 for<br />\n100. Bill Milne covered 200 yards<br />\nin 1.47 followed by Mark<br />\nHorning with a 48.5 for 100 and<br />\nBob Schwenkler with a 22.3 for<br />\nthe final 50 yards. The total time<br />\nWas 4 minutes, 11.74 seconds<br />\nWith Maryland .19 seconds<br />\nbehind.<br />\nThe other victory came in the<br /><br />\n400 yard butterfly relay with a<br />\ncombined time of 3:38.07 for<br />\nHopkins followed by Maryland<br />\nwith a 3:39.19. Swimming for<br />\nthe Blue Jays were Nigrelli<br />\n(57.2), Tom Stenovec (57.6),<br />\nHorning (52.3) and Milne (51.9).<br />\nMore Scores<br />\nIn the 400 yard freestyle relay<br />\nand 400 yard backstroke relay,<br />\nHopkins placed seventh. The 400<br />\nyard freestyle relay produced a<br />\nfifth while the 200 yard freestyle<br />\nrelay team garnered a sixth. In<br />\nthe 200 and 400 yard medley<br />\nrelays, Hopkins placed ninth<br />\nwhile its 400 individual medley<br />\nrelay finished eight.<br />\nTo appreciate the significance<br />\nof the showing, it should be<br />\npointed out that of the first<br />\nseven teams, only Hopkins and<br />\nBucknell do not give swimming<br />\nscholarships. As Coach Comfort<br />\nstated, \"It was great to surprise<br />\nsome people in a big meet. All of<br />\nthe top swimming teams on the<br />\nEast Coast with the exception of<br />\nthe Ivies were there.\" Since the<br />\nshorter sprint relays are not the<br />\nstrength of the team; Hopkins<br />\ncould do a lot of surprising in its<br />\ndual meet schedule this year.<br />\nGone from last year's list of.<br />\nvictims are Penn State, PMC<br />\n(Widener), Drexel, and Towson.<br />\nInstead of continuing the 15 dual<br />\nmeet schedule, Comfort opted<br />\nfor only 10 dual meets. However,<br />\nsix of the meets are against such<br />\nUniversity Division teams as<br />\nMaryland, Connecticut, and<br />\nNavy.<br />\nHopes<br />\n\"One of our hopes is to<br />\nimprove on our sixth place finish<br />\nof last year at the NCAA College<br />\nDivision Nationals,\u2014 stated<br />\nComfort. The only significant<br /><br />\nI3-ballers bounce back,<br />\ntake third in tourney<br />\nAfter their initial loss to<br />\nTowson in the Schaefer Metro<br />\nClassics, the Blue Jay basketball<br />\n.team recorded consecutive<br />\nvictories over Coppin State and<br />\nUMBC on Friday and Saturday<br />\nevenings.<br />\nThe Coppin game was fairly<br />\nclose until five minutes had<br />\nelapsed in the second half. Then<br />\nHopkins went on a tear,<br />\noutscoring their opponents by an<br />\n18-6 margin. It was a laugher<br />\nfrom then until the final buzzer<br />\nsignalled the end of the game<br />\nWith Hopkins on top 98-72.<br />\nLeading the Blue Jays with 23<br />\nPoints was Paul Spence followed<br />\nby Bob Freedman with 22 points<br />\nand 5 assists. Billy Jews threw in<br />\n16 and picked off 11 rebounds.<br />\nGrey DeLong had lu points<br />\nWhile John Rutter scored nine<br />\nand recorded seven assists.<br />\nThe Saturday contest was<br />\nanything but a laugher. UMBC<br />\ngave the Blue Jays fits all<br />\nevening, but Hopkins pulled out<br />\na 79-72 decision. Leading<br />\nHopkins in scoring was Freedman<br />\nWith 23 followed by Jews with<br />\n17.<br />\nBut the story of the game was<br />\nsenior walk-on Al Robinson.<br />\nNearing the end of the first half,<br /><br />\nCoach Gary Rupert inserted<br />\nRobinson into the game. Al<br />\npromptly turned things around<br />\nwith his defensive work,<br />\nballhandling, shooting and<br />\npassing.<br />\nAt one point in the second<br />\nhalf, Jews, Freedman, and Rutter<br />\nwere all riding the bench with<br />\nfour personal fouls. Robinson<br />\ncontrolled the game and kept the<br />\nBlue Jays in the contest with his<br />\nleadership. He finished the game<br />\nwith a perfect shooting<br />\npercentage of 1.000 (5 for 5)<br />\nfrom the floor. Near the end of<br />\nthe game, Rupert substituted for<br />\nRobinson. As he ran off the<br />\ncourt, he received a standing<br />\novation from the crowd.<br />\nMorgan won the tournament<br />\nwith a 63-62 victory over host<br />\nTowson State. Baltimore<br />\nUniversity climbed third with a<br />\nvictory over Loyola. Next came<br />\nHopkins, UMBC, and Coppin.<br />\nHopkins forward Billy Jews<br />\ndeserved a spot on the<br />\nAll-Tournament team, but did<br />\nnot get it.

By the age of fifteen, he had<br />\ncold hands and one thrombosis attack. At<br />\neighteen he had a left ventricle cut open and a<br />\nSiphon put in his heart. That same year, before<br />\nIcollege separated us, my friend and I drew up a<br />\nJoint will in the presence of a lawyer. Hector<br />\nbequeathed his artificial siphon to me since he<br />\nbelieved it was the only property he truly owned<br />\nand the only part of his body that would not<br />\nburn in cremation. In return, I bequeathed to<br />\nHector my father's villa which I expected to<br />\ninherit and which seemed to be the only<br />\nPossession I truly owned and could not fit into<br />\nthe grave with me. Confident that we had both<br />\nWilled the life source of our hearts, my friend<br />\nand I separated for our respective careers.<br />\nDuring our first scholastic year,<br />\nHector wrote letters to me signed 'bone of your<br />\nhone, Hector Grierson.' Since I knew he liked to<br />\nbe cryptic, I considered this phrase a secret<br />\nsymbol of our boyhood alliance. Little did I<br />\nre\"alize how cryptic, my<br /><br />\nA Ventricle Cut Open<br /><br />\n***<br />\nMoored at the docks, the<br />\nStephen Bonaventure resembled a mansion on<br />\nwater. I had not seen a four-tiered ferryboat since<br />\nboyhood and the size of its smoke-stacks gave me<br />\nan old thrill. After Wheeling my baggage down<br />\nthe deck, a bell captain '. unlocked the door to my<br />\ncabin, complaining that business was bad enough<br />\nfor three-hour voyagers to rntrit private rooms.<br />\nOnce my daor was shut, I<br />\nsearched ,through my briefcase for, a zoom-lens<br />\nattachment, thinking to myself. \"Rivrboats are<br />\nwonderful. I can bring my camera andsuitcases<br />\neven my car with my bicycle strapped to the<br />\ntrunk.\" And as I thought this, the engine's kicked<br />\nover, knocking my briefcase \u201et\u201e the 11:b` or and<br />\nthrowing me against a windoW, where I,Could see<br />\nthe paddlewheel spraying jets of surf over the<br />\nlower railings, .yhite enought to blast a negative.<br />\nGradually, bands of sunlight widened on the deck<br />\n. pillars and I realized we were moving away from<br />\nthe dock.<br />\nWhen the water level hit our<br />\nhullmark, my eyes strayed back to the<br />\npaddlewheel , sifting sunlight through jts slats like<br />\nthe treadmill on My own farm back . in Florida.<br />\n.Now I am sure that nothing is ever forgotten, for<br />\nI could still see my father when he installed the<br />\npump for the :paddlewheel and said to me with a<br />\nsmik, \"This is our generator. 'You watch the<br />\nlights tonight, Stanny. If the lights dim or go out,<br />\nyou know the paddlewheel is broken.\" Then he<br /><br />\nfriend was becoming until a letter arrived with a<br />\nsanitarium postmark and Hector's admonishment:<br />\n\"Do not visit me, I am only bone and bone.\" In<br />\nthat letter I counted twenty appearances of the<br />\nWord 'bone' from the description of his steak<br />\ndinner to the kind of china cups used at the<br />\nhospital. In his final paragraph he admitted<br />\nthat his siphon was skipping and he feared<br />\nitnminent death. This fear was somehow linked<br />\nWith a failure to lift and carry a set of bar-bells put his hand on my chest so that I ,could feel my<br />\nat the hospital's therapy center. I could not own breathes and he said \"You've got a pump<br />\nunderstand why he needed to carry a weight that keeps you going, and now our place has got<br />\nWhich most healthy men could not lift. When I a pump as well. You listen for it tonight Stanny,<br />\nreassured him through letters that his own fear of as it's directly under your room. I'll bet you'll<br />\nWeakness was causing his siphon to skip, he hear this old house, breathing like your own self.<br />\nseem ed not to read my lines. He only dwelled But,\" he cautioned with a smile, \"if this motor<br />\nupon \"the weight I cannot carry; the iron bar my stops, you let me know right away. Wake me up,<br />\nheart will not let me lift.\" Then before his letters because it means the house has stopped breathing<br />\nCeased, he admitted that some joker had printed .and would die unless I .got to it in dine.\" Then<br />\nold crossbones' on each weight in luminous he laughed, mussed my hair and walked away.<br />\nThat night I lay in blackness listening to the<br />\nPaint.<br />\nI did not pay attention to our paddlewheel keep my home aliye, and each turn<br />\nbreak in communication, for at this time my of its slats was distinct to me 1ike a welcomed<br />\ntather died and our villa with its orange groves breath of air. And since that wheel was under my<br />\n4rid swamps was sold for tax debts. I was called window, it was my duty to listen all night, which<br />\nback to Florida briefly to authorize auction of I did, for nothing seemed more terrifying than<br />\nthe estate and thought no more of Hector until having my villa live without air until my father<br />\nsomeone mentioned 'siphoning the swamps.' For 'got to it in time.' And I am proud to say, due to<br />\n41 onth s thereafter I envisioned Hector's left my sleepless nights, tht wooden. wheel never<br />\nntricle in my sleep and thought I saw his sipon stopped until the day my villa was auctioned and<br />\nthe swamps were drained.<br />\nPuinping out the last of my beloved swamps.<br />\nHow brilliantly the water<br />\nthe<br />\nship's wheel, a much faster and<br />\nfrom<br />\nsprayed<br />\nLosing interest in land, I<br />\nmechanism<br />\nthan the pump at home. I<br />\nbecame adept at photography and did unusual stronger<br />\ntricks with shadows.<br /><br />\nThe Wheel Mechanism<br /><br />\nwanted a picture of its mowers ploughing up the<br />\nsea, for it brought back wonderful memories and<br />\nthat old sense of duty I had toward keeping my<br />\nhome alive. Grabbing my camera, I found a place<br />\non deck where light was scarce and from there I<br />\ntook twelve snapshots of the wheel in motion.<br />\nFocusing through the lens, I could sec no hub or<br />\nspokes, but a breaking wave which never spent<br />\nitself and never reached a shoreline.<br />\nOnce I had exhausted the film, I<br />\nwas not satisfied to let the negatives sit in their<br />\nsprockets, but wanted to develop them within the<br />\nhour. I tried to turn my cabin into a darkroom<br />\nby pulling the shade and stripping the window<br />\nwith tar paper, but still I could find my way<br />\naround without\\ tripping over furniture. Despite<br />\nthis extraneous light. I began transferring the film<br />\nfrom one container to another when the door<br />\nburst open sending in floods of daylight and<br />\ncausing me to clrfcp the plastic cylinder with its<br />\nfilm unravelling across the floor. In the door way,<br />\na bell captain stared speechless at the darkened<br />\nroom. I confronted him in uncontrollable anger.<br />\n\"What the hell do you want?\" I shouted, \"Do<br />\nyou know what you've done? Do you know what<br />\nyou've ruined? Never in my life have I aborted a<br />\nnegative. What in hell was so important for you<br />\nto come bursting in without warning?\"<br />\nHe answered, \"I've got to have<br />\nyour ticket.\"<br />\n\"Damn it you idiot, get out of<br />\nhere.\" I picked up a bottle of sodium carbonate<br />\nand hurled it at the slamming door. In all my<br />\nyears as a practicing photographer I had never<br />\nbeen interrupted during the process of developing<br />\nfilm: nor had I ever lost a negative, nor had I<br />\never dropped a container or broken a bottle of<br />\ncaustics. Losing these negatives \u2014 above all others<br />\nthese \u2014 over the issue of a ticket made me burn<br />\nwith rage. It was as if I had my home in Florida<br />\nsnatched from me all over again. No, it was more<br />\nthan this. It was as if I had a part of my brain<br />\ntorn away. For no one can understand how<br />\nimportant my negatives are to me. No one can<br />\nunderstand why I define my negatives carefully<br />\nand handle them with lead gloves. To me they are<br />\nthe sources and not to be tossed away like final<br />\nprints. They are the sources. At my feet, the<br />\nempty container rolled back and forth- in half<br />\ncircles. I sat on the floor and fingered the<br />\nphotographs I would never see. \"So,\" I reasoned,<br />\n\"I can bring my camera and suitcases and even<br />\nmy car with my bicycle strapped to the trunk but<br />\nhave to leave my negatives in the ship's<br />\nincinerator.\" I kicked my camera under a chair<br />\nand walked out on deck.<br />\nI had been at the rail for an<br />\nhour when an incident occurred which made an<br />\ncontinued on page 4<br /><br />\nThe Crows/The Men<br />\nThe Crows:<br />\nThe evening dusk settles on<br />\nthe land like a brown ash.<br />\nThe clouds ladder their way<br />\nto the horizon and through them<br />\nwe watch the last blues of sky.<br />\nPerhaps, tonight, the powder snow will come.<br /><br />\nMiddled Steepled House<br />\nA city dressed for the evening mattina.<br />\nLittle Vanity.<br />\nShe's the girl next door.<br />\nShe wants satin dresses, fancy shoes and<br />\na fella to choose.<br />\nPouting<br />\nstamping<br />\ntantrums and wants are the toys she plays<br />\nwith.<br />\nOld mom, you work so hard, and really cherish<br />\nher so can't you see her seasons changing.<br /><br />\nThe Men:<br />\nEven on clear nights<br />\nthe moon does not come.<br />\nOn cloudness nights<br />\nthere are no stars.<br />\nThe crows own the night.<br />\nThe night<br />\nis the great crow's wing.<br />\nThe crows lay their eggs<br />\nin the dead's clothes.<br />\nDeath's skull is a pale egg.<br /><br />\nYou'd like to see her get it better.<br />\nThe nest seems too small.<br />\nNot being with it makes life a bore.<br />\nThis nightowl got wings to take to the<br />\nflight.<br />\nI've seen her take to the night.<br />\nWhile a tiny neighborhood slumbers away<br />\nand mother sleeps on the third floor<br />\nsteepled apartment.<br /><br />\n-40<br />\nSee,.<br /><br />\n.0.\u2022<br />\n**<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022;\u2022,\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nlr\u2022\u2022<br />\n- -\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n-\u20227\u2022;\u2022;<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nSomeone's got her in a spell.<br />\nYou're just an old fool.<br />\nIf you keep it up you'll end up in a<br />\nwitch's pool.<br />\nI know what's happened to her, and I know<br />\nthis valley and the power of those dark<br />\nallies.<br />\nThe movie scared me.<br />\nI dared her.<br />\nI cried, oh my lord.<br />\nShe teased me with death on her breath.<br />\nSomeone's got her in a spell.<br />\nYou're just an old fool.<br />\nIf you keep it up you'll end up in a<br />\nwitch's pool.<br />\nI know what's happened to her, I know<br />\nthe valley and the power of those dark<br />\nallies.<br />\nLittle Vanity got her crepe and she'll<br />\nsmother you with bribes and sneaks.<br />\nshe's the vita to a band.<br />\nHitting sour notes with her mom and other<br />\nfolks.<br />\nShe's down a colored road<br />\nYellow down<br />\nBlue down<br />\nBlack down<br /><br />\nThe Crows:<br />\nWhen the snow comes, it is pale.<br />\nWe can never be snow.<br />\nThe nights are long and our young,<br />\nnested far over the hills and high in the trees,<br />\nawait their food.<br />\nIn the town, the fires rise in each house.<br />\nWhen the night freezes our breath, we think<br />\nhow warm those homes must be.<br />\nThe Men:<br />\nWe are cursed<br />\nto wander the unlit rooms of the earth.<br />\nThe world is flat;<br />\nthe clouds boil from edge to edge.<br /><br />\nAshen clouds with sun speckles<br />\nSkip over the frosted fields<br />\nAs a gray man<br />\nBarely brings his sickle to a whisper.<br />\nHis motions no longer<br />\nFlow like waves over the grass.<br />\nEach day the weeds<br />\nSeem to stiffen<br />\nAs his blade dulls.<br />\nHe has so far to go.<br />\nEven the sun that befriends him<br />\nHas grown old and its breath<br />\nIs unable to restore life lost.<br />\nLooking up, he watches<br />\nHis friend close its gray eyelid<br />\nfor the last time.<br /><br />\nThe Crows (turning):<br />\nThe clouds do more than that.<br />\nThe earth is round.<br />\nJames Taylor<br /><br />\nIt has been a night of storms.<br />\nThe oar blades glisten<br />\nAs the water slides by us<br />\nIn the dark.
